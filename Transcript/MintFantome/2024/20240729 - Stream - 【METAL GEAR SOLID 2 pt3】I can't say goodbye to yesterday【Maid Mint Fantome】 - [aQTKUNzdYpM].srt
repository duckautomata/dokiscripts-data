1
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,220
Oh, wait.

2
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,820
Go back to the main menu.

3
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,240
Go back to the main menu!

4
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,880
What?

5
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,560
There we go.

6
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,680
Kept you waiting, huh?

7
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,780
Howdy, Minto!

8
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,040
Hi, Minto!

9
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:39,280
Welcome back to Metal Gear Solid 2!

10
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,600
Yippee!

11
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:40,700
Yippee!

12
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,760
Yippee, yippee, yippee!

13
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,860
Yippee, yippee!

14
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,460
Good morning, Minto, even though it's afternoon.

15
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,480
Good morning, Minto.

16
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,380
What took you so long, Minto?

17
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,240
I don't know.

18
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,580
I think... I don't know.

19
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,800
I was distracted on TikTok.

20
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,040
But yes, welcome back.

21
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,160
And everything.

22
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm gonna do my best to get through as much of the game as possible today.

23
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,120
But no pressure if I don't finish or do finish or whatever.

24
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,600
It's the Vinyl guy from the con!

25
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,940
I hope you enjoy it.

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,080
Also, your Q&A was fun.

27
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
We hope to see you back in Texas again.

28
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,960
Thank you, Breeze!

29
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,880
Oh my gosh!

30
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,540
I can't wait!

31
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,140
Oh my gosh.

32
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,900
The Vinyl, I'm so...

33
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,360
Thank you!

34
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,540
Can we have a quick recap from the previous two episodes?

35
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,440
Of course, Paul!

36
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,820
That's a great... That's a great idea.

37
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,060
So...

38
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,840
For those who are familiar with the game, we are right about to...

39
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,680
To...

40
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,660
Disable the bombs and then...

41
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,420
No, that is not Solid Snake.

42
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,540
But...

43
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,300
If you... Oh my gosh.

44
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,420
Thank you for all the super chats!

45
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:03,820
Oh my gosh.

46
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,140
Hold on.

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,580
I'll give you a second.

48
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,560
And then I'll read them.

49
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,780
Let me do the recap first.

50
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,580
And...

51
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,560
I'm trying not to, like, spoil.

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,520
So...

53
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,500
Basically...

54
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,740
From the very beginning...

55
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,360
Two years ago...

56
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,020
On...

57
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,480
In...

58
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,620
In New York...

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,680
The Hudson River...

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,760
Two years ago...

61
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,820
Solid Snake dies!

62
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,240
Solid Snake dies on the tanker after he fought Olga...

63
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,580
And after...

64
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,840
Ocelot...

65
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,720
Stole the Metal Gear...

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,140
He double-crossed...

67
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,820
Gurlukovich...

68
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,120
And...

69
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,220
Um...

70
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,140
Killed Gurlukovich...

71
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,280
The Russian...

72
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,800
Um...

73
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,100
Side...

74
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:45,980
And everything...

75
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:46,820
Um...

76
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,820
And he stole...

77
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,120
Metal Gear Ray...

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,020
From...

79
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,700
Um...

80
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,200
From the military...

81
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,040
And he was just like...

82
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,580
Ha ha ha...

83
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,200
This is mine!

84
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,400
Ha ha ha...

85
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,440
And...

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,740
Um...

87
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,220
Then...

88
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,240
Solid Snake dies.

89
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,240
So sad.

90
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,000
So, so sad.

91
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,340
But then we move two years later...

92
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,360
On to the...

93
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,800
Um...

94
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,820
To the Big Shell...

95
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,740
The Big Shell incident where...

96
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,800
A group of terrorists...

97
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,500
Called...

98
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,680
Dead Cell...

99
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,940
Have taken hold...

100
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,700
Of the President.

101
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,260
Oh my god!

102
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,140
Not the President!

103
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,660
And...

104
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,180
Um...

105
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:17,560
They're...

106
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:17,960
But...

107
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,440
But...

108
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,980
They're led by their leader...

109
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,100
Solid Snake!

110
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,020
Whoa!

111
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,040
Oh my gosh...

112
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,100
Not Solid Snake...

113
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,860
But he died...

114
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,980
On the tanker...

115
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,580
Two years ago!

116
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,500
What?

117
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,220
And...

118
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,040
Um...

119
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,540
So we are riding...

120
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,940
And we're going around...

121
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,080
And we've disabled bombs...

122
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,640
We...

123
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:38,780
Um...

124
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:38,860
We...

125
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,160
Well, the guy who taught...

126
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,720
Taught us how to disable bombs...

127
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,560
Also blew up...

128
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,000
So...

129
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,020
Um...

130
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,980
We fought...

131
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,040
A fat man...

132
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,720
We...

133
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:47,880
Um...

134
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,600
Uh...

135
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,120
We met Fortune...

136
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,680
And she's really sexy...

137
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,140
Yeah...

138
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,700
We met a bisexual...

139
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,480
Um...

140
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,920
That was Vamp...

141
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,880
Um...

142
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,120
We...

143
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,220
Uh...

144
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,780
Met Plissken...

145
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,260
Who...

146
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,000
Um...

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,380
We've never met that guy before...

148
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,040
Ever before...

149
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,600
And...

150
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,060
Um...

151
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,700
Yeah...

152
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,240
Now...

153
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,540
We're trying to get to...

154
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,120
The president...

155
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,000
Um...

156
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,440
But first we must cross a field of...

157
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,440
Bombs...

158
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,400
That we must disable...

159
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,680
Blow up...

160
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,220
We must shoot the bombs...

161
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,700
Iroquois Plissken...

162
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,360
Maximilian!

163
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,760
Thank you!

164
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,200
First time being able to catch a Metal Gear stream live...

165
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,460
So it's lovely to see you in real time...

166
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,620
I hope you're taking care of yourself...

167
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,680
And that you have a fantastic day...

168
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,200
Thank you!

169
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:31,880
Yoshi!

170
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,960
Welcome back for two months!

171
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,180
Awesome to be here!

172
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,600
Love you guys!

173
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,080
Thank you!

174
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,020
Football!

175
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,800
Oh...

176
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,220
Oh...

177
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,680
Today's not my birthday...

178
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,460
But it was on Thursday...

179
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,680
I kept missing your streams because of work...

180
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,440
Can I get a happy birthday please?

181
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,040
Of course!

182
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,660
Happy birthday to you...

183
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,500
Happy birthday to you!

184
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,880
Happy birthday dear football!

185
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,060
Happy birthday to you!

186
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,020
Happy birthday!

187
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,860
I think I got everything...

188
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,100
Did I cover everything?

189
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,180
Is that everything?

190
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,220
Is that everything?

191
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,660
We saw some sexy ladies in lockers, some sexy ladies in the bathroom.

192
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,080
Schrodinger's snake.

193
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,780
He's simultaneously dead and not dead.

194
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,500
Yes.

195
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,940
There was a parrot?

196
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,060
Yeah, we saw a parrot.

197
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,140
Oh, Rose!

198
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,920
Nothing of Rose.

199
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,660
And Olga.

200
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,620
Yes.

201
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,700
Well, sorry, I said Gurlukovich, I forgot to mention his daughter, Olga.

202
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:43,600
We fought her on the tanker as snake, and now she's still working with Ocelot and not Solid Snake.

203
00:07:44,540 --> 00:08:00,440
And, of course, Raiden has his lovely, lovely, lovely partner of... lifetime partner who he'll never abandon, who he'll never ever take for granted, who she is loyal and will never leave him either.

204
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,380
They're going to grow happy and old and die together.

205
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,860
And that's Rose.

206
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,560
And she...

207
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,980
And they never have any problems.

208
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,160
They're the healthiest relationship ever.

209
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,700
What did I ask?

210
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,880
Because I asked this to get different views.

211
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,440
What motivates you to keep going in life?

212
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,360
When things get stressful, what do you do to keep yourself from worrying about things?

213
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,260
That's a deep question, Yoshi.

214
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,540
Thanks for the super chat.

215
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,160
What keeps me going in my afterlife is...

216
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,220
The ability to see my Oshi.

217
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,120
If I can see my Oshi, then there's something worth staying dead for.

218
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,160
And I always worry.

219
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,760
Sorry, I don't stop worrying.

220
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,440
I don't know how to do that yet.

221
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,440
Good morning, Mint-chan.

222
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,340
Good morning.

223
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,280
Wish me luck.

224
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,700
I have multiple job interviews next...

225
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,480
Subplots!

226
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,780
Good luck with your interviews!

227
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,980
Oh my gosh!

228
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,760
Good luck, good luck, good luck!

229
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,640
But yeah, now I think I got everything.

230
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,000
So yeah, we're about to disable some bombs.

231
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,300
And...

232
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,020
Yeah.

233
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,040
We'll see how far I get today.

234
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,420
I'm thinking...

235
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,300
I don't know.

236
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,940
Andrew goes next to the 20 gifted!

237
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,700
Thank you.

238
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,700
Load.

239
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,340
How did we get to 2099?

240
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,120
Huh?

241
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,000
Wait.

242
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,280
How did we get to...

243
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,560
Huh?

244
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,170
Poor MGS2.

245
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,770
My brain is still comprehending Hideo Kojima's tweets about Deadpool Wolverine.

246
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:52,970
Yes.

247
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,450
I love Hideo Kojima's tweets about the new Deadpool Wolverine movie.

248
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,330
And how he was just like...

249
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,370
It's so awesome seeing Wolverine so ripped.

250
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,190
And so muscular.

251
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,030
And I'm like...

252
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,170
What do you mean by that?

253
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,130
Oshilove is strong, for real, for real.

254
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,210
Hi mint, my Oshii.

255
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:12,530
Hello!

256
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,610
Wow, it's been 99 years.

257
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,170
What does he mean?

258
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,410
I don't...

259
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,390
He means what he said.

260
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,330
That guy...

261
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,310
That guy always means what he says, right?

262
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:32,830
Oh!

263
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,270
Alright, let me get used to the game once again.

264
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,950
So, am I going to get a call from Colonel if I get too close?

265
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,110
Oh!

266
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:42,510
Oh!

267
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,670
Raiden, you haven't destroyed all the control units yet.

268
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:48,910
Oh.

269
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,050
Use the first person view or the sniper scope to look around.

270
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,410
How's the audio, by the way?

271
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,450
Let me know.

272
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,490
The Otakutan 2024 schedule was uploaded on guidebook.

273
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,990
Looks like your meet and greet autograph is Friday, day one, evening.

274
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,210
Hoping there will be space in line if I line up.

275
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:03,750
Five hours!

276
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,050
Oh my gosh, Ghost of Mid, please.

277
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,590
You don't have to...

278
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:10,070
I have several meet and greets for Otakutan this coming weekend.

279
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:17,230
I have several meet and greets, so please don't feel like you have to line up so early, okay?

280
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,750
Please don't...

281
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,350
Please.

282
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,490
Please.

283
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,770
Just another day for Raiden, aka Agent Lovely Hips.

284
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,630
Best dancer.

285
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,910
Now it's time to eat chicken.

286
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:29,710
Yippee!

287
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,810
Yes, and I do have...

288
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,610
Let's see.

289
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,870
Let me get all my ducks in a row.

290
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,630
That's how I'm kicking.

291
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,690
This is how I'm...

292
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,990
Oh gosh, don't go overboard, Raiden.

293
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,950
All right, let's...

294
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,910
We have a sniper.

295
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,190
Where is our sniper?

296
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,350
Oh, here it is.

297
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,130
We have...

298
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:49,530
Look at that.

299
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:59,070
We have the PSG-1T Tranquilizer Rifle.

300
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:01,750
Tranquilizer...

301
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,390
Tranquilizer Rifle, yeah...

302
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,090
But we're going to use this one.

303
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,910
How do I zoom in on this thing?

304
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,790
Zoom with O.

305
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,390
Fire with square.

306
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,030
O...

307
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,170
Sons of Libra.

308
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,510
I've got to get that bird.

309
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,530
I'm going to get that bird.

310
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,130
Hold on.

311
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,190
I'm going to get that bird.

312
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,870
Stop, Raiden.

313
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,190
Stop!

314
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,050
He's like...

315
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:26,330
Don't...

316
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,940
I think I got it.

317
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,040
Does it not shoot through the...

318
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,520
Does it not shoot through the thing?

319
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,360
Does it not shoot through the flag?

320
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,560
Oops, I pressed the wrong button.

321
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,920
Oh gosh, I don't want to run out of bullets.

322
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,560
You'll hear it if you get it.

323
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,440
I think I need to take some posesamine.

324
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,440
Where is my posesamine?

325
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,820
Or... wait a second.

326
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,000
Raiden has cigarettes!

327
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,860
Oh, I have ten of them.

328
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,140
Perfect.

329
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,920
There we go.

330
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,320
Okay.

331
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,830
I think I'll get it.

332
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,310
What the heck?

333
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,330
Okay, let's get the other stuff first.

334
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,430
Let's get the other things first.

335
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,890
Oh, move birds!

336
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,330
Move!

337
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,270
Okay, that's one.

338
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,720
I don't know actually how many there are.

339
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,460
Move birds!

340
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:53,800
Move!

341
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,680
I don't think I killed him.

342
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,480
There's two.

343
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,400
I don't know how many there are.

344
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,130
Three?

345
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,610
Wait, why are those still blinking though?

346
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,710
Also, I don't... Oh!

347
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,390
There it is.

348
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,750
Alright.

349
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,530
Wind!

350
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,990
Wind!

351
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,430
Wind!

352
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,830
Oh!

353
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,650
Wind!

354
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,170
Wind!

355
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,730
Oh, I got it.

356
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,050
Nice.

357
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,510
How did you guys... I can't hear it.

358
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,430
Am I deaf?

359
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,240
How many are left?

360
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,070
Raiden, you didn't get all the control units.

361
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,330
You weren't thorough enough.

362
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:02,810
I'm not done!

363
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,130
Take a good look at the airborne cipher.

364
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,850
You can see the control unit for the IR sensor.

365
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,370
Huh?

366
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,390
The control unit is right above cipher's camera.

367
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,050
Avoid shooting the camera at all costs.

368
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,670
Looks like if a cipher is shot down, the resulting signal will trigger an explosion.

369
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,210
The whole bridge would blow.

370
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,030
Target only the control unit on the upper part of the cipher.

371
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,630
Aim for the blinking light.

372
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,350
Blinking light.

373
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,930
Okay, I wasn't...

374
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,490
Let me finish my art!

375
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,450
I know there's a cipher.

376
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:33,990
Oh, here.

377
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,350
Oh, a blinking light?

378
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,250
Okay, I got you.

379
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:39,970
Oh, geez.

380
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,810
Oh, gosh.

381
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,790
Oh!

382
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,590
You sent the blinking light!

383
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,450
What the hell happened?

384
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,690
Raiden!

385
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,680
Snake!

386
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,300
Snake!

387
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,380
You sent the blinking light!

388
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:09,980
Snake!

389
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,460
Oh, gosh.

390
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,520
You sent the blinking light!

391
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,780
I mean, Plissken.

392
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,740
Sorry.

393
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,680
I swear that guy, like, just gets me every time.

394
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,620
Thanks for making AFES a fun experience.

395
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,100
I already bragged about meeting you.

396
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,340
It's the second most famous person in my friends.

397
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,680
I'm not even.

398
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,120
Thanks to your brainwrap panel, I now learned MGS is really about butts.

399
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,520
Yeah!

400
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,080
Thank you for coming to meet me!

401
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,060
Thank you so much.

402
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,020
Yeah, Freudian slip.

403
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,900
Freudian slip.

404
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,860
Same voice actor?

405
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,720
I don't think even...

406
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,500
I think they sound really different, actually.

407
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,920
I don't even think it's the same voice actor.

408
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,100
I think it's just, you know...

409
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,180
Okay.

410
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,660
Did I misunderstand what you said?

411
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,420
Plissken?

412
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,760
Plissken, oh Plissken.

413
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,320
Alright, alright, come on.

414
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,240
Come on, Raiden.

415
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,300
Come on, Raiden.

416
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
Raiden, Raiden, shaking hands, Raiden.

417
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,560
Raiden, Raiden.

418
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,740
Raiden, stop shaking your...

419
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,480
There we go.

420
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,220
Stop shaking your hands right now, Raiden.

421
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,040
I don't know how, actually, that managed to hit.

422
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,680
I'll be honest.

423
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,060
That didn't seem like it should have hit.

424
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Because I was low.

425
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,800
Can I go down now?

426
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,700
I deactivated it!

427
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:39,760
Raiden!

428
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,900
Raiden!

429
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,800
But I deactivated them!

430
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,180
Okay.

431
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,940
That's a no.

432
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,720
This is...

433
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,880
This is what's gonna take the longest.

434
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,460
In today's stream.

435
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,260
Just trying to...

436
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,460
Okay, well now I know.

437
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,540
Okay.

438
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,420
And one more over here.

439
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,580
Okay.

440
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,600
No, we're not finishing.

441
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,300
Shut up!

442
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,380
This part?

443
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,300
Yeah, we're not finishing this part today.

444
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, guys.

445
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,700
Sorry.

446
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:18,900
Sorry.

447
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Oh, dang it.

448
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,740
No, come on, Raiden!

449
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,400
Raiden!

450
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,100
Ow!

451
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,300
Raiden!

452
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,380
Oh my god.

453
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,640
This is the...

454
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,040
Colonel didn't even...

455
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,120
Actually, was that Colonel?

456
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,520
He didn't even sound like he was sad about me dying.

457
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,800
He sounded so disappointed.

458
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,420
He was like, Raiden, what are you doing?

459
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,000
Raiden!

460
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,180
Raiden!

461
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,580
Okay, I'll take the...

462
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,520
I was trying to do it without the Pizazzamine, but I'll do it with it.

463
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,060
Okay, guys.

464
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,400
We won't blow up this time.

465
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:00,960
This is the run.

466
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,790
Can I still get it?

467
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,490
Even when it's behind the flag.

468
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,490
I never actually knew if I could...

469
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,110
Oh yeah, I did.

470
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,530
Okay, nice.

471
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,210
Then there's the one...

472
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,150
What's the blinking light?

473
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,250
Oh, at the very, very top?

474
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:33,810
Maybe?

475
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,330
What's the blinking light?

476
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,830
Bulletproof flag.

477
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,490
The flag was...

478
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,910
still there.

479
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,390
Oh say...

480
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,610
Uh...

481
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,110
Pizazzamine.

482
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,250
Green light.

483
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,350
Did I not get the green...

484
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,730
Gosh, this part's so silly.

485
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,410
Plissken?

486
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,990
I thought I got the blinking light.

487
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,310
Okay, I'm gonna aim for the tippy-toe.

488
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,290
No, no, no, no.

489
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,080
Yippee!

490
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,980
Okay, and...

491
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,160
Oh, I remember this one.

492
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,280
Is that all of them?

493
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:32,790
Oh, gosh.

494
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,250
I don't remember...

495
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,070
what other ones there are.

496
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,710
Was there any that I need to lay down for?

497
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,170
Because we'll...

498
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,070
They tell you when we're good, so...

499
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,350
They tell you when we're good.

500
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,570
Plenty of laying down ones.

501
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,250
Plenty of laying down ones.

502
00:20:59,250 --> 00:20:59,790
Why?

503
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:00,690
I don't know why I'm...

504
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,730
Mustache Man!

505
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,330
Why?

506
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,450
Thank you for the welcome to...

507
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,710
Looking forward to more episodes of everyone's favorite telenovela.

508
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,030
Reglas de la...

509
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,950
Reglas de la...

510
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,370
Natural...

511
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,470
Naturaliza.

512
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:16,730
What?

513
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,880
Oh!

514
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,260
I see it, I see it!

515
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,720
Oh, yes!

516
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
That's... Duh!

517
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,500
The one that I got before!

518
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,900
This one.

519
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,440
Does it mean?

520
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,380
Does it mean?

521
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:35,900
Does it mean?

522
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,800
Uh...

523
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,100
Zoom in.

524
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,440
Enhance.

525
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,940
Sorry, birds.

526
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,260
I'm gonna destroy this party.

527
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,640
Why can't I move just slightly?

528
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,460
Oh!

529
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,180
There we go!

530
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:52,980
Yay!

531
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,440
I don't think I hit one.

532
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,080
Did I?

533
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,140
I don't think so.

534
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,380
Pew!

535
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,020
Alright!

536
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,840
Okay, are you guys ready?

537
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,460
Wait.

538
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
I have a grenade launcher.

539
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,160
I don't have a stinger.

540
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,640
Do I get it here?

541
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,540
I sure hope so.

542
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,500
Let's go!

543
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,660
They'll toss you one?

544
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:31,880
Okay.

545
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
I'm all ears.

546
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,680
Is it in good shape?

547
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,640
Full tank.

548
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,420
I'm heading for shell one now.

549
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,900
What about that Harrier?

550
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,700
It's not on the heliport here.

551
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,380
Good.

552
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,760
I'll set this one down there then.

553
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,860
Can you cover the hostages?

554
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,340
They're being held on level B1 in the core.

555
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,480
It's... yeah.

556
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,540
You didn't happen to find any other places where hostages were being held, did you?

557
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,140
No.

558
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,260
Nothing like that.

559
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:56,940
Okay.

560
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,860
How many hostages are there?

561
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,420
There's a few short of 30.

562
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,720
One dead and several wounded.

563
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,800
The Kasatka's cargo area will hold 13 max.

564
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,380
What about the other Kasatka?

565
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,100
Kasatka?

566
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,140
I sabotaged it.

567
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,440
It can't come after us if it can't get off the ground.

568
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,140
No.

569
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,940
We'll have to make two trips.

570
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,660
Can you fly a Kasatka?

571
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,020
I have a pilot who's flown the civilian model.

572
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,720
The Ka-62 and VR.

573
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,840
There's not a whole lot of difference between the military Ka-60 and the civilian model.

574
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:24,600
No.

575
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,460
Cleared for takeoff.

576
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,880
Let me introduce you to my partner, Otacon.

577
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,900
Otacon?

578
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,120
Hey, Raiden.

579
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,060
Nice to meet you.

580
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,160
It's Brutus!

581
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,820
Over here!

582
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,620
Damn!

583
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,640
Raiden, I'll talk to you later.

584
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh my god!

585
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,600
It's Sna- I mean, Plissken!

586
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,020
I'm sorry.

587
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,660
I'm the worst.

588
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,100
Colonel, I need some answers from you.

589
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,980
Who exactly is Plissken and his partner?

590
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,880
I know what you're thinking.

591
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,480
It keeps coming back to Shadow Moses.

592
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,960
And now this Otacon...

593
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,020
A.K.A.

594
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,560
Hal Emmerich, Ph.D.

595
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,920
A Shadow Moses survivor.

596
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,760
Rose?

597
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,220
Snake and Otacon both became fugitives after Shadow Moses wanted to act as a terrorist.

598
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,360
...in that section where Colonel is just angry.

599
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,960
...an anti-Metal Gear organization.

600
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,900
They sabotaged and destroyed countless Metal Gear units throughout the world.

601
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,180
And were responsible for the incident two years ago that necessitated the construction of the Big Shell.

602
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,900
Snake and his partner aren't terrorists.

603
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:19,680
Wait.

604
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
What do you mean Snake and his partner?

605
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,080
You mean Plissken?

606
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,900
I look back on what I've done here so far.

607
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:29,120
And things like training and sense of duty alone won't get you through a sneaky mission like this.

608
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,780
Jack, are you okay?

609
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,240
Are you okay?

610
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,700
I can't think of the right word, but it has to be pure will.

611
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,780
Backed up by courage or ideals or something like that.

612
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,340
He's starting to believe.

613
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,640
He's starting to believe.

614
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,300
The Solid Snake that saved Shadow Moses couldn't turn into a terrorist.

615
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:48,880
Yeah.

616
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,800
Maybe that's true.

617
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,320
But they went down with that tanker two years ago.

618
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,440
We even recovered Snake's body.

619
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,020
Yeah.

620
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,940
And the DNA test results on the body say it's him.

621
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,500
It's him.

622
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,140
Jack, I know what you're saying, but Snake is dead.

623
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,660
Hmm.

624
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,740
He can't be here.

625
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,000
Not sure how I feel about that.

626
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Not even as this Dr. Hal Emmerich.

627
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,780
But that also means that he can't be the terrorist leader behind this thing.

628
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,580
Yeah, he died.

629
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,880
He died.

630
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,580
No more Solid Snake.

631
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,340
Whoa.

632
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,570
Uh-oh.

633
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,570
A Harrier?

634
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,610
No.

635
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,510
I love that guy.

636
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,110
I love that guy!

637
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,110
I love that guy!

638
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,410
I love that guy!

639
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,350
No Harrier.

640
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,650
We're good to go, guys.

641
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,250
We're good to go, guys.

642
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,250
A trash bag!

643
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,230
I've been waiting for you.

644
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,730
A messenger from the Patriots.

645
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,770
A messenger

646
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,270
from the Patriots.

647
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,410
No, not just around here.

648
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,970
I'm the boss to surpass Big Boss himself.

649
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,110
Solid Snake.

650
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:15,910
No!

651
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,950
That is not Solid Snake!

652
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:18,830
No,

653
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,550
that is not Solid Snake!

654
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,790
What a pleasant surprise, brother.

655
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,250
Save it.

656
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,990
Don't say you've forgotten me.

657
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:36,250
Don't say you've forgotten me.

658
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:36,630
Oh my god, the...

659
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,290
Snake!

660
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,770
That was Snake?

661
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:41,850
No.

662
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,610
Who was you?

663
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,430
Solid Snake 2.

664
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,030
Snake?

665
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,570
Take cover.

666
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,470
Ahhh!

667
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,310
Oh my god, you're gonna blow up the whole bridge!

668
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,550
Oh my god, you're gonna blow up the whole bridge!

669
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,310
Oh my god, he's so awesome.

670
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,950
Oh my god, he's so awesome.

671
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,610
Stop impersonating him!

672
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:02,950
Yeah!

673
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,850
Identity theft is real!

674
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,030
Brother, I'm a whole different game from Liquid.

675
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,090
Nano Machines.

676
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,480
Oh my god.

677
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,800
I cried.

678
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,560
Wow!

679
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,140
Um, hi!

680
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,540
There's someone else on the bridge here.

681
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,020
Please...

682
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,740
Oh my god.

683
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,620
Oof!

684
00:27:54,910 --> 00:28:00,010
The voice acting is so low compared to like the sound effects and the audio and everything.

685
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:00,790
Ah!

686
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,000
No, complain.

687
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,920
There it is.

688
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,080
There's the Harrier.

689
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,180
We're

690
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,280
in trouble.

691
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,180
It's the Harrier.

692
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,440
It's the Harrier.

693
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,440
He's getting...

694
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,500
Just shave him!

695
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,640
Wax him!

696
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,780
If he's Harrier!

697
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,160
Oh.

698
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,920
He's a shrinky baby.

699
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,690
How can a plane like that be sneaky?

700
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,270
The world needs only one big boss!

701
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,720
Oh my god, Top Gun moment.

702
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,620
I'll drown you fools for interfering!

703
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,680
Ahhh!

704
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,580
My

705
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,480
ears, please!

706
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,540
Right.

707
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,320
This is the Stinger Missile Launcher.

708
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:20,780
Yippee!

709
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,040
The Kasaka can't stand up to the Harrier.

710
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,700
Why not?

711
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,320
You have to shoot the Harrier down.

712
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,980
Oh, okay.

713
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,660
It's happening in the bay right now.

714
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,200
Oh, no.

715
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,000
Oh, no, no.

716
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,240
This is a little far out.

717
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,340
But we do eventually get to the bay.

718
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,780
I thought you meant like this is happening in the bay right now in New York.

719
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,040
Hahaha.

720
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,180
Okay, I'm going downstairs.

721
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,240
Goodbye!

722
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,760
Okay.

723
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,140
How do I remember to do this?

724
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,720
Oh!

725
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,820
Oh my gosh!

726
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,560
Please get... Why are you sending it to me from up there?

727
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:57,860
Okay.

728
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,320
Where is it?

729
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,280
Where?

730
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,020
Oh, Stinger.

731
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,160
Oh my god.

732
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,480
Blalalalalala.

733
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,660
Oh my goodness!

734
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,420
Blalalalalala.

735
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,120
Oh gosh, I have to remember how to do this fight.

736
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,940
Where is he anyway?

737
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,400
Oh.

738
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,280
He's on this side.

739
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,360
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

740
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,400
Where are you?

741
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,880
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

742
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,660
I think he's upstairs.

743
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,460
Oh yeah, there he is.

744
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,560
Ah!

745
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:33,980
Oh.

746
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,980
I think I ran into the wall.

747
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,180
Everybody.

748
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,820
Classic.

749
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,560
Minto move.

750
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,660
Oh.

751
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,130
Get out of the way, Plissken!

752
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,010
You're scaring me.

753
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,250
Oh my god, there he is.

754
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,200
Shoot the copter.

755
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,720
Take cover!

756
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,940
Take cover?

757
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:14,900
I think.

758
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,980
Is this when he starts doing everything?

759
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,580
Where is he anyway?

760
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,080
Oh.

761
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,340
Oh my god, he's so fast.

762
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,180
Oh.

763
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:26,800
Oh.

764
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,880
Yeah, it would be great if I...

765
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,260
Hahahahaha.

766
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:39,960
Bozo!

767
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,380
Hahahahaha.

768
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,300
What are you going to take...

769
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,420
What are you going to take care of, huh?

770
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,540
Oh my god.

771
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,160
Is that the best you can do?

772
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,920
Well, if you would just give me a chance!

773
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,240
I'm just standing here.

774
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,580
Hahahahaha.

775
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,280
Hahahahaha.

776
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,280
Let me in!

777
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,560
Let me in!

778
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,900
Mom said it's my turn!

779
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,080
This thing is so fast.

780
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,520
Oh my god.

781
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:17,900
Ah!

782
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,100
This is when he starts blowing everything up.

783
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:27,940
Hahahahaha.

784
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,040
Oh.

785
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,620
Go in!

786
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:30,920
Go in!

787
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,180
Go in!

788
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,580
For the kill!

789
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:31,660
For the kill!

790
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,440
I would have just hit the wall.

791
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,500
Am I even going to get a shot at getting this guy?

792
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,600
Where is he?

793
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,080
Where'd he go?

794
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,420
Oh, there he is.

795
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:47,820
Come on!

796
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,500
Oh my god, it...

797
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:53,680
Oh.

798
00:32:59,330 --> 00:32:59,750
And

799
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,620
I wait.

800
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,560
Risk it, go upstairs.

801
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,040
Why do I need to go upstairs?

802
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,500
I'm cozy down here.

803
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,440
I'm cozy down here.

804
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,220
Is that the best you can do?

805
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,040
You have...

806
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,680
You have not hit...

807
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,200
You maybe have hit me once.

808
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,540
Come on!

809
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,320
Is that the best you can do?

810
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,840
I'm literally standing still!

811
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,460
Solid dust?

812
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,680
Best you can do.

813
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,340
My butt.

814
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,000
Where are you?

815
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,360
Where are you?

816
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,780
Oh my god.

817
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,060
Oh, there he is.

818
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,800
Just...

819
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,740
I always loved how when you shoot a semtex, the whole bridge blows up.

820
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,680
But with these two...

821
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,960
I know, right?

822
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,240
It's so unfair.

823
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,300
Where...

824
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,520
Oh no!

825
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,600
Okay.

826
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,380
Oh!

827
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,840
Oh my god, he did hit me.

828
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,760
Oh god, he did get me.

829
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,240
Okay, I'm good now.

830
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,560
Got hit by a missile, no biggie.

831
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,320
Nice!

832
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:27,600
Hit you!

833
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,020
There we go.

834
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,680
Did I get him?

835
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,460
I don't think I did.

836
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,220
Shoot.

837
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,500
No, I don't think I got him!

838
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,440
Wait, can I get him here?

839
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,680
Come on, come on.

840
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,780
Oh, I don't think I will.

841
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,880
I think I'm gonna blow myself up if I try.

842
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:41,860
Ah!

843
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,180
Oh!

844
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,740
Can you get up, Ryland?

845
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,300
Oh!

846
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,440
Is he gonna get me?

847
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,720
I think I should...

848
00:34:59,010 --> 00:34:59,730
Yeah, I know.

849
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,830
I was totally looking the wrong way.

850
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,230
Where does he come from?

851
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,230
He like comes usually from like this.

852
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,390
Where is he?

853
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:11,590
Ah!

854
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,740
Oh, you're bleeding again.

855
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,360
This guy is so all over the place.

856
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,300
Fire, fire.

857
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,380
Get his butt!

858
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,080
Get his butt!

859
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,000
Just take the shot!

860
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,260
There we go.

861
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,240
These camera angles crack me up.

862
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,160
I'll shred you to pieces!

863
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,140
Oof!

864
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,600
Oof!

865
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,140
Oof!

866
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,860
Gosh, he's got so much health.

867
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,470
What are you taking care of anyway?

868
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,350
What are you doing?

869
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,130
His butt is so prominent.

870
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,450
I swear!

871
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,510
In the HD collection!

872
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,250
I think they nerfed Ryland because...

873
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,290
He looks good in this game.

874
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,970
He looks good, good in this game.

875
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,790
He looks good, good in this game.

876
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,770
He looks good, good in this game.

877
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:31,950
I'm not!

878
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,570
Oh my gosh.

879
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,370
You!

880
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,430
Oof!

881
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,970
My man just says oof.

882
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,370
So funny.

883
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,250
Oof.

884
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,610
What is this?

885
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:56,170
Die!

886
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,570
Yeah!

887
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,710
You're tougher than I thought.

888
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,190
I'm just sitting down here, dude.

889
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,610
I'll let you go out in style!

890
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,510
Did I get him?

891
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,210
Nice!

892
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,690
Oh, but not like...

893
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,630
Not super...

894
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,230
It's not a super good shot.

895
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,440
Nice!

896
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,900
Still got him though.

897
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,620
It's hard finding him sometimes.

898
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:33,980
Oh!

899
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,120
Oh!

900
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,120
Oh!

901
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,460
Oh!

902
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,520
Woo!

903
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,340
Woo!

904
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,620
Take the shot!

905
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,080
Oh, I didn't get him.

906
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,060
Bit by bit.

907
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,380
Yeah, bit by bit.

908
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:58,940
Ugh.

909
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,260
Oh, gosh!

910
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,080
He's out here somewhere.

911
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,360
We'll get him.

912
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,020
Oh, there he is.

913
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,700
Run!

914
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,280
Nice.

915
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,140
We get that nice, good old head-on collision.

916
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,100
Did I get him?

917
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,020
I can't tell sometimes if I get him or not.

918
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,840
Die!

919
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,360
What a tough walk, boy.

920
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,440
Okay.

921
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,680
I'll let you take care of...

922
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:33,780
Oh!

923
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,360
Is he on the other side?

924
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,280
Where is he?

925
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,280
Oh!

926
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:45,820
Shoot.

927
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,200
Dun, dun, dun.

928
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,540
Okay.

929
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,560
Oh!

930
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,220
Oh, this side?

931
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,420
Oh, he's doing his like far away thing, right?

932
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,000
There he is.

933
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,380
There he is!

934
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,560
Got a lot of smoke coming off of you.

935
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:16,660
Buddy.

936
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:18,540
You're

937
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,940
not looking so good, man.

938
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:30,750
This thing is...

939
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,450
It's just indestructible.

940
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:34,410
Yeah!

941
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,130
Oh, my God.

942
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,150
That was like the small...

943
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,330
Oh!

944
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,410
It's like the smallest amount of damage ever.

945
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,510
How much...

946
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,050
How many bullets?

947
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,030
Oh, I still have a lot of bullets.

948
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,830
But I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get him in time, to be honest.

949
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:47,930
There he is.

950
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,110
Oh, maybe I can.

951
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,710
Maybe I will.

952
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:56,630
We'll see.

953
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,190
Die!

954
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,870
Oh, dang it!

955
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,190
Oh, my gosh.

956
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:06,870
Can I get him from here?

957
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:07,890
Wow!

958
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,680
Okay, let me try again.

959
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,420
It's the little...

960
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,460
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice.

961
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
Okay, good, good, good, good.

962
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,380
Is that the best you can do?

963
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,140
Is that the best you can do?

964
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,160
Okay, he's back on that side.

965
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,840
And...

966
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,560
Shoot!

967
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,080
I didn't... I didn't get him.

968
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,820
Oh, thank you!

969
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,100
Where?

970
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,240
Oh, up there!

971
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,100
You're gonna make me run for it?

972
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,540
Come on!

973
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,800
I'll let you go out in style!

974
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,680
I usually

975
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:55,650
like to get him...

976
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,150
during that part, but...

977
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,330
Hey!

978
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,200
I'll let you go out in style!

979
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,320
I'll let you go out in style!

980
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,440
I'll let you go out in style!

981
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,420
Bye, Solonit!

982
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,040
Bye, Solonit!

983
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,780
We got his eye!

984
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,320
We got his eye!

985
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,940
Into the ocean!

986
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:26,760
Oh!

987
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,960
There's something coming up!

988
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,560
It's my throw-up.

989
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:32,860
It's my throw-up!

990
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,760
It's my throw-up!

991
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,020
Whaaa!

992
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,100
All right.

993
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,480
So dramatic.

994
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,620
That's Metal Gear!

995
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,080
It's already active!

996
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,980
It's already active!

997
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,580
Oh, my gosh.

998
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,880
It catches it in his mouth.

999
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,720
It's the cutest thing.

1000
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,460
Look how cute!

1001
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,800
Ray is just like a little puppy dog.

1002
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,720
How can you not think Ray is the cutest thing ever?

1003
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,060
How can you not think Ray is the cutest thing ever?

1004
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,760
There's a blade in his mouth!

1005
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,200
He's so cute!

1006
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,920
Oh my god, what a show.

1007
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,040
You got this, Raiden!

1008
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,280
You got this, Raiden!

1009
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,520
Level 2 grip!

1010
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,100
Yeah, if we hadn't had the level 2 grip, we would have fallen into the ocean.

1011
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:38,780
True facts.

1012
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,640
Oof.

1013
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,160
You might want to get, like, an eyepatch or something for that.

1014
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,280
Who are you telling that to?

1015
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:52,840
Vamp?

1016
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,440
Does he care?

1017
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,460
They got my eye!

1018
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,080
Me eye!

1019
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,400
Where is he going?

1020
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,780
Vamp, go!

1021
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,460
He's like...

1022
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,320
He jumps into the water and swims away?

1023
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,420
Like, where is he going?

1024
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,060
Oh my gosh!

1025
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,120
Please, Plissken!

1026
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,440
He's just... Oh my gosh, he's watching the show.

1027
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,800
Oh my god.

1028
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,180
He's like...

1029
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,100
When I see some buns, I get hungry.

1030
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,320
Oh, there he goes.

1031
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,720
What a freak, this guy.

1032
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,640
It.

1033
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,760
It's running on water.

1034
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,240
It.

1035
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,060
He doesn't even call Vamp, like, a person.

1036
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,720
Vamp is an it.

1037
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,620
Oh my god.

1038
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,080
Vamp, the true strongest character in the series.

1039
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:07,210
Raiden doesn't know what to think about any of that.

1040
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,590
Raiden, you alright?

1041
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:10,330
Yeah.

1042
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:11,590
How about you guys?

1043
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,830
Yeah, you have some splainin' to do.

1044
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:13,910
Yeah, you have some splainin' to do.

1045
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:14,770
The chopper?

1046
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,510
We need some time for repairs.

1047
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,290
The chopper.

1048
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,890
The president's all yours.

1049
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:19,530
The president's all yours.

1050
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:20,930
Can I ask you something?

1051
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:21,710
What?

1052
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,010
Are you THE snake?

1053
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:25,550
Are you THE snake?

1054
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,450
They said you were dead.

1055
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:26,810
They said you were dead.

1056
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:27,850
Big shell's only like three inches deep.

1057
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:27,930
No, not me.

1058
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,250
There are still too many things I need to do.

1059
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:30,490
There are still too many things I need to do.

1060
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:30,950
Oh my god!

1061
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,390
Snake, you're a legend, and that's why I need to ask you this.

1062
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:34,590
Yeah.

1063
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:35,390
Legend.

1064
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:35,970
Legend.

1065
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,350
A legend is nothing but fiction.

1066
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,910
Someone tells it, someone else remembers.

1067
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,570
Everybody passes it on.

1068
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,750
I'm here because I was assigned to this mission, not because I want to.

1069
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:46,610
Be snake.

1070
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,750
If I could, I'd be out of here in a second.

1071
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,510
So it was snake after all.

1072
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:51,510
How could you come back to all this?

1073
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:52,750
Why keep fighting?

1074
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,730
There's something my best friend said to me once.

1075
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:56,890
What?

1076
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:59,870
We're not tools of the government, or anyone else.

1077
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:04,970
Fighting was the only thing I was good at, but at least I always fought for what I believed in.

1078
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,650
What about the DNA results from that body?

1079
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,090
That was Liquid's body.

1080
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:12,670
He and Snake are identical on the genetic level.

1081
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:13,630
Liquid?

1082
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:14,370
Liquid?

1083
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,770
For our own protection.

1084
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:18,590
We stole his frozen body from some organization.

1085
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,030
That's crazy.

1086
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,250
Kind of a hassle though.

1087
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:21,750
That's all there is to it.

1088
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,090
We just took his body.

1089
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:24,930
Are you to me an NGO?

1090
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:29,850
Insofar as we're a non-profit organization of civilians advocating a cause, yes.

1091
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,290
The cause happens to be the eradication of Metal Gear.

1092
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:33,850
Yes.

1093
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:34,890
We work on our own.

1094
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:35,430
Philanthropy.

1095
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:36,890
But it's a cause worth fighting for.

1096
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,830
Why would you stick your neck out for something this risky?

1097
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,910
That's the way I used to look at it.

1098
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:42,770
Four years ago.

1099
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:45,330
I was holed up in the middle of nowhere in Alaska.

1100
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:46,970
Drinking too much.

1101
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,310
We have a responsibility to the coming generations.

1102
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:49,890
You had dogs!

1103
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:50,890
What are you talking about?

1104
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,010
What responsibility?

1105
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,310
Keep track of the mistakes we've made as a species.

1106
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,590
Crazy how Plissken disappears and Snake shows up.

1107
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:58,170
I know.

1108
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,570
To fight for change.

1109
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,470
And that's what keeps me alive.

1110
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:02,710
History says we're very complex.

1111
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:03,810
You think you can change the future?

1112
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,850
I'm not as arrogant as that.

1113
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,470
What you do isn't grassroots activism.

1114
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,070
It's more like terrorism.

1115
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:10,450
Hey!

1116
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:11,670
No it's not.

1117
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,230
I mean, maybe it is.

1118
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:14,850
But our group, Philanthropy, received some information.

1119
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:17,890
A new Metal Gear prototype was being developed here.

1120
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,290
And terrorists were planning to raid the facility.

1121
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,350
The information came from a very reliable source.

1122
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,090
So you're here too.

1123
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,990
We're here to stop all that.

1124
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:27,990
Very reliable.

1125
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,410
But I also have a personal motive.

1126
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,410
Looks like the terrorists have his sister in the big shell.

1127
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:33,190
Oh my god.

1128
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,050
We're here on our own.

1129
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,470
Not under anyone's orders.

1130
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,110
We have our own battles.

1131
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:37,470
No.

1132
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:38,890
Otacon's here for someone.

1133
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,950
I'm not.

1134
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:41,950
This is a military mission.

1135
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:43,130
So?

1136
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,350
O-okay.

1137
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:46,630
Jack, are you alright?

1138
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,150
Just barely.

1139
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,090
You almost gave me a heart attack.

1140
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:50,690
Here you go again.

1141
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,270
It wasn't intentional.

1142
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:53,330
I know that.

1143
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:55,490
And I know I need to stay stronger.

1144
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,310
Say a prayer for me, Rose.

1145
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,810
So I can come back.

1146
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,590
You will make it back.

1147
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,310
I'm with you all the way.

1148
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:02,670
Remember.

1149
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:04,570
That means a lot to me, you know.

1150
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:05,190
Aww.

1151
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:06,410
I'm going to save the data.

1152
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,070
Okay, Jack?

1153
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,710
Yes, thank you.

1154
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:11,850
Alright, now we're about halfway through, right?

1155
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:12,610
So...

1156
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:14,150
Good stuff.

1157
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:17,010
Twenty-nine to nine.

1158
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,670
These two are so inseparable.

1159
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:21,170
What?

1160
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,070
They're the best ever!

1161
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,590
Colonel, Metal Gear's already gone active.

1162
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:28,090
It's not too late.

1163
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,530
You can still prevent a nuclear strike by securing the President.

1164
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:34,310
And preventing password confirmation from taking place.

1165
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:34,790
Okay.

1166
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:35,930
Get to the President.

1167
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,970
He's in the core section of Shell 2.

1168
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,310
I'm checking the satellite images.

1169
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:43,490
Looks like you can get to the core from the other side of Strut L.

1170
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,090
The core hasn't gone under yet, from what we can tell.

1171
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,910
Follow the railings down.

1172
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,570
Then jump onto the pipes.

1173
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:49,990
Okay.

1174
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:52,830
The only viable strut in the outer perimeter is the L.

1175
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,170
That attack just now doesn't make any sense.

1176
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,730
It's like they have no more use for this place.

1177
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:00,870
Colonel, you were monitoring the codec calls.

1178
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:04,030
That man was the real Snake all along.

1179
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:04,390
Yeah.

1180
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,150
Maybe.

1181
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,070
Maybe.

1182
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,270
Don't let your guard down with him.

1183
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:08,790
Maybe.

1184
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:09,550
Why do you say that?

1185
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,070
Because they were never a part of the simulation.

1186
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,050
They're an unknown factor.

1187
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:14,670
Maybe.

1188
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,310
You can take this simulation and...

1189
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:16,930
Yeah.

1190
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,830
We're out here, we bleed, we die.

1191
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:20,090
I'll say it for you, Raiden.

1192
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,390
Shove it up your ass.

1193
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:21,550
Calm down.

1194
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,290
I suggest that you do, Raiden.

1195
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:23,990
Shove it.

1196
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,230
Even if that is Snake.

1197
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,810
That has no bearing on your mission.

1198
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:28,690
Colonel.

1199
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,850
You and Snake used to be allies.

1200
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:31,830
You and Snake used to be on the same side.

1201
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,030
I don't understand.

1202
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:38,750
I read about you and Snake in In the Darkness of Shadow Moses.

1203
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:41,870
I don't give a damn what that piece of trash said.

1204
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,210
Do you get me?

1205
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:47,070
You've changed, Colonel.

1206
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,350
Colonel in this game is so...

1207
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:51,790
So...

1208
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:53,830
He's so mean.

1209
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,950
He's so mean in this game.

1210
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:58,330
Why you gotta be so mean?

1211
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:58,630
Oh, wait.

1212
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,270
The coolant is this one, right?

1213
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:02,690
Here it is.

1214
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,510
Snake broke his heart.

1215
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:11,870
Okay.

1216
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,170
Now I won't accidentally burn myself.

1217
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:16,850
What?

1218
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:19,830
Oh!

1219
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:20,510
Oh!

1220
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,630
Wait!

1221
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,350
Wasn't there a ration in there?

1222
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:28,370
Aww.

1223
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:28,610
Oh.

1224
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,050
Oh, man.

1225
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,310
So much for that ration.

1226
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:32,890
No!

1227
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:37,130
Puskin, can you send me another, please?

1228
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:38,690
No!

1229
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,450
I forgot that it was gonna fall.

1230
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:44,770
No!

1231
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:47,390
No!

1232
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,670
I just cartwheel over...

1233
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:50,850
Wait.

1234
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:51,990
How do I...

1235
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:52,710
I don't remember, actually.

1236
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,070
Do I just cartwheel over?

1237
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:57,110
Oh, gosh.

1238
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:57,890
Oh, my gosh.

1239
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:57,910
Oh, my gosh.

1240
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,800
Oh, on the other side.

1241
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,620
The one with the bird poop?

1242
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,140
The side that's actually trying to kill me?

1243
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,280
It's a leap of faith.

1244
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:22,990
Jack!

1245
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,010
What's going on?

1246
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,010
Answer me!

1247
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:26,090
Jack?

1248
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,150
Jack!

1249
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:29,150
It's Jack, right there, floating.

1250
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:30,930
Never learning how to swim.

1251
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:32,830
No faith.

1252
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:35,350
Wait!

1253
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:37,870
We can get the ration now.

1254
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:38,670
Maybe.

1255
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:39,730
Hold on.

1256
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:40,030
Okay.

1257
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:40,710
I'm not gonna...

1258
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:40,930
I'm...

1259
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,430
I'm listening to Mei Ling.

1260
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:49,450
I'm not gonna be so stupid to always try for the...

1261
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:49,830
You know?

1262
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,310
I don't have to...

1263
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:51,650
You know?

1264
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:52,150
But...

1265
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:52,990
What if I just...

1266
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,450
Run down?

1267
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,210
Grab it?

1268
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:56,630
Run up?

1269
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,040
What a gamer.

1270
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,440
Yeah!

1271
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:19,900
Okay.

1272
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:20,860
All right.

1273
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,520
I have to...

1274
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,540
Oh, gosh.

1275
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,760
He'll grab onto this, right?

1276
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,240
He'll grab onto this, right?

1277
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:25,980
He'll grab onto this, right?

1278
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,100
He'll grab onto this, right?

1279
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,260
Mei Ling is right.

1280
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,200
You're just that good.

1281
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,660
You missed the boat.

1282
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,860
Here we...

1283
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,000
Lean onto the railing.

1284
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:54,910
No!

1285
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:56,270
This isn't happening.

1286
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,330
Jack, you have to answer me!

1287
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:58,990
Jack!

1288
00:51:59,470 --> 00:51:59,810
Jack!

1289
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:05,430
Nice one, gamer.

1290
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:06,090
Thank you.

1291
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:08,450
Oh!

1292
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:09,490
Someone's calling me.

1293
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:10,430
Wait, what?

1294
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,350
My cell phone is going off.

1295
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:13,110
Hello?

1296
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:15,510
Hello?

1297
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,490
Use the cool it spreader...

1298
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:18,190
God damn it!

1299
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:18,510
I know!

1300
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:26,350
What do you think I've been doing?

1301
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:29,970
God, how did you get this number?

1302
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,620
How did you get this number?

1303
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,920
Happy April 30th!

1304
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,840
Please remember to live, laugh, love in these trying times.

1305
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,160
Thank you.

1306
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,460
I don't remember how to do it.

1307
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:57,420
I remember having to go to that pipe over there and be careful of the bird poop and everything.

1308
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,500
I just don't remember how to get over there.

1309
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,400
Live, laugh, grow fat.

1310
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,600
Flip over the railing after pressing on it.

1311
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:13,970
Oh!

1312
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,060
Thank you.

1313
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,190
You think this is a good spot?

1314
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:31,770
Over a little bit.

1315
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:33,650
Level 2 grip, baby.

1316
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:35,730
Oh, no, no, no.

1317
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:41,690
Oh, gosh.

1318
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,610
Oh, Raiden, Raiden, Raiden.

1319
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:45,110
You're scaring me, Raiden.

1320
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:46,410
You're scaring me, Raiden.

1321
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:48,990
Okay.

1322
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,210
Crawl, crawl, crawl.

1323
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,730
Crawl, crawl, crawl.

1324
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:52,650
I hate this part.

1325
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:53,750
Crawl, crawl.

1326
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,910
This is even how speedrunners do it.

1327
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:56,530
They're too scared.

1328
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,030
They're too scared of this part.

1329
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:00,450
They crawl too.

1330
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:01,730
Everybody crawl.

1331
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:04,290
Oh, my God.

1332
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:04,710
Jump.

1333
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:05,910
Yippee!

1334
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:06,750
Okay.

1335
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:07,830
We're all good.

1336
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:08,510
Oh, no.

1337
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:09,810
Almost.

1338
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:10,590
Almost there.

1339
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:11,490
Grab it.

1340
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:13,170
Grab, Raiden.

1341
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:14,430
Grab the...

1342
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,610
Grab, Raiden.

1343
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:15,850
Go.

1344
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:16,390
Lift up.

1345
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:17,370
Lift.

1346
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:18,490
Lift.

1347
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:19,350
Lift.

1348
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:21,590
Lift.

1349
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:22,810
Lift.

1350
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:23,170
Lift.

1351
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:28,810
Lift.

1352
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,270
Remember the basics of skateboarding.

1353
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:33,090
Oh!

1354
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,190
It's on fire now!

1355
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,850
Wait!

1356
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,290
Was it always on fire?

1357
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:37,370
Did that just happen?

1358
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:41,250
Run!

1359
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:51,050
There are guys here, aren't there?

1360
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,230
I don't have a nerd.

1361
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:56,750
Aren't there guys here though?

1362
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,590
Where do they come out?

1363
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:04,920
Scoot, scoot, scoot.

1364
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,400
Jump!

1365
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,500
No sir, no sir, no sir.

1366
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,700
Oh my gosh.

1367
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,240
I have to get them to move closer.

1368
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,760
Perfect.

1369
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,820
Nobody else, right?

1370
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:41,380
Nothing here.

1371
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,660
Oh no.

1372
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,500
Dangling.

1373
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,380
Dangling.

1374
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,980
Dangle, dangle, dangle, dangle.

1375
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,200
Dangle, dangle, dangle, dangle, dangle.

1376
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,200
Dangle, dangle.

1377
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,100
Isn't this where the AK-74 suppressor is?

1378
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:05,700
Wait, really?

1379
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,880
Hi Mint.

1380
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:13,260
Hello!

1381
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,440
Wait, is it actually?

1382
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,930
Are those guys still asleep?

1383
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:20,470
Or...

1384
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:23,150
Who am I hearing?

1385
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,540
Who am I hearing right now?

1386
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,220
Who am I hearing right now?

1387
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,220
Oh, this is where they're...

1388
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,140
This is the windows.

1389
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,360
I remember this part.

1390
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,800
Oh gosh, I remember this part.

1391
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,500
I wonder how far can I get from...

1392
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,080
dangle dangling.

1393
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,300
Oh my god.

1394
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,760
You'll encounter nothing.

1395
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,560
You'll encounter nothing.

1396
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:51,740
You'll encounter nothing.

1397
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,670
Gosh, he saw me so fast.

1398
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:00,910
Uh...

1399
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,070
Just a vax?

1400
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:06,850
They won't be able to see me.

1401
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:07,950
Oh my god.

1402
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,430
Just a vax!

1403
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:14,690
Just a...

1404
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,560
Just a vax!

1405
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,960
Do you think he can tell?

1406
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:25,380
Do you think he can tell?

1407
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:26,620
Just

1408
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:31,990
a vax!

1409
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,430
Just a vax!

1410
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,060
Those other guys are still asleep.

1411
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,160
Maybe I'm okay.

1412
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:45,880
Maybe I'm okay.

1413
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,040
Maybe I can go.

1414
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:46,760
Maybe I can go.

1415
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,540
Bam, bam, bam.

1416
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,060
Bam, bam, bam.

1417
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:58,060
I don't think I can crawl here, because I'm pretty sure at some point the, um...

1418
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,080
From what I remember...

1419
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,380
Oh my gosh, I can't use it here.

1420
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,940
Oh my gosh, I can't use it here.

1421
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:09,580
Oh my gosh, I can't use it here.

1422
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:10,680
Oh my god.

1423
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:10,920
Oh no, no!

1424
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,000
That's not what I meant to do.

1425
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,940
Don't the floors give out though at some point?

1426
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,800
Go up, go up.

1427
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,270
When do we get beat on?

1428
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,220
I'm scared.

1429
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,160
Soon.

1430
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:52,900
Soon.

1431
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,320
Are those guys still asleep over here?

1432
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,560
No way.

1433
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,220
Oh gosh, I wish I could take them out again.

1434
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,000
There's too many guys!

1435
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,340
Go away!

1436
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:05,560
You know what?

1437
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:05,960
Screw it.

1438
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:07,760
Let's just crawl.

1439
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:10,860
For now.

1440
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,120
I can't see where they are.

1441
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:20,680
Oh!

1442
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:22,960
Oh!

1443
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,660
Okay, but this is...

1444
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,420
Maybe okay.

1445
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,160
Now I can at least see where he is.

1446
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,100
You know?

1447
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:35,820
Oh,

1448
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,020
alright, nice.

1449
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,280
Level 2, grab baby!

1450
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:47,980
Bye!

1451
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,820
Bye losers!

1452
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:50,620
Bye idiot!

1453
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:51,980
Wait!

1454
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:01,590
Oh wait.

1455
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:05,410
Oh god, it looks like always he's looking directly at me.

1456
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:05,750
Right?

1457
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:08,510
Freaks me out.

1458
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:10,050
Okay.

1459
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:12,390
Now...

1460
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:13,230
Okay.

1461
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:15,370
Careful.

1462
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:18,070
Can I...

1463
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,010
Wait, how do I get past that part?

1464
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:24,650
Can I just walk past it?

1465
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:29,900
You can crouch mid-press.

1466
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:30,620
Duck?

1467
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:31,880
Okay.

1468
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,800
Thank you.

1469
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,020
In fact, we'll just do that the whole way, baby.

1470
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:56,800
Wait.

1471
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,580
I think...

1472
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,820
Oh, look at... this is such a nice view!

1473
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,520
I think this is where we get peed on.

1474
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:17,380
This is for you guys!

1475
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,880
Wow, what a... what a...

1476
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:24,460
Wow!

1477
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,860
He's just going everywhere.

1478
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:27,520
Wow!

1479
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:30,240
Okay.

1480
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,060
Thanks, Kojima.

1481
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,540
Oh my god, there's so many of them!

1482
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:46,830
Oh, the codec!

1483
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:47,470
You're right, thank you.

1484
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:49,890
I hope I didn't miss it.

1485
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:52,370
Codec while peeing.

1486
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:54,130
Wait.

1487
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,370
Did I miss it?

1488
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:58,290
Hold on, let me try again.

1489
01:01:58,890 --> 01:01:59,650
Is he still going?

1490
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:01,670
No!

1491
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:02,830
No!

1492
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:05,270
I think I missed the codec.

1493
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,230
He doesn't care.

1494
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:21,250
I guess Rose doesn't care if I get peed on or not.

1495
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:22,210
Does he do it again?

1496
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:22,970
We'll wait.

1497
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:25,530
Oh, I'm going to go in my pants.

1498
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:29,250
You're really excited about getting peed on?

1499
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:33,050
No.

1500
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,630
I was excited for you guys.

1501
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:38,450
Call him again.

1502
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:40,590
Cardo!

1503
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:51,050
Don't worry about it, Jack.

1504
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:51,690
It's okay.

1505
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:52,590
Rose?

1506
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:56,690
That is, as long as you take a shower the second you get back.

1507
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:57,830
Do we have a deal?

1508
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:00,990
You look so...

1509
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:02,450
sad.

1510
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:08,330
I got so caught up in this I forgot.

1511
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:09,010
Skirt check!

1512
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:10,970
Skirt!

1513
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:13,790
Today I have a skirt on.

1514
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:16,270
Skirt check!

1515
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:17,650
Skirt!

1516
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:18,150
Skirt!

1517
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:18,570
Skirt!

1518
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:19,030
Skirt!

1519
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:20,490
Skirt!

1520
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:21,810
Certified freak phantom moment.

1521
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:23,570
I did not put that in the game.

1522
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:24,010
Okay?

1523
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,850
I did not decide that that should be a mechanic.

1524
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:28,250
You know?

1525
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:32,410
Oh!

1526
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,660
I think I can take it out from here.

1527
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:40,460
Oh!

1528
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:42,920
Dang it.

1529
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:43,360
Wrong part.

1530
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,500
I always forget.

1531
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,320
It's the bottom part.

1532
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:46,900
Oh, and it's gone.

1533
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:48,820
Okay.

1534
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:51,600
Am I good to just...

1535
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,680
I want to take it out before I run over there.

1536
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:53,960
You know?

1537
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,000
Let's see.

1538
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:58,220
Come back!

1539
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:03,880
Come back!

1540
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:04,520
Come back!

1541
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:09,970
At least it wasn't Johnny.

1542
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:13,730
Sorted!

1543
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:14,890
Welcome to membership!

1544
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:15,610
Thank you!

1545
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:18,730
Will we get him?

1546
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:19,950
You know what?

1547
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:20,630
Let's just go.

1548
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:30,460
Oh!

1549
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,120
I'm all full!

1550
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,100
Wow.

1551
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,300
Just gonna... okay.

1552
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,300
I'm gaming.

1553
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,640
When you develop the...

1554
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:44,040
this game, how many people tried to stop you from adding this?

1555
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,960
It was definitely a...

1556
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:49,560
a...

1557
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,040
decisive...

1558
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,080
divisive decision.

1559
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:54,920
You know?

1560
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:55,580
Oh my god.

1561
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,360
Oh my god!

1562
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,140
Oh my god!

1563
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,000
Oh my god!

1564
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:58,420
Oh my god!

1565
01:04:59,020 --> 01:04:59,540
Hey!

1566
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:00,640
Hey!

1567
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,180
What if I take out?

1568
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:03,840
Like...

1569
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,740
What if I... What if I... Like...

1570
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,100
What if I...

1571
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:10,480
What if I...

1572
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,000
I'm just gonna run for it.

1573
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,040
Why are you giving me so much stuff?

1574
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,520
Oh no, it's all...

1575
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,100
It's broken.

1576
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:26,800
We gotta go into the core.

1577
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,160
Now I can take it out.

1578
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:29,840
Probably.

1579
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:32,260
What the?

1580
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:33,980
There we go.

1581
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:38,840
Where's the other ones?

1582
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:40,620
Where's the other ones?

1583
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,420
Oh, there.

1584
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:44,760
Dang it.

1585
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,160
These things are so...

1586
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,740
These things are so...

1587
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:03,180
These things are so particular!

1588
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:05,780
These things are so particular!

1589
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:06,960
I think if I...

1590
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,180
Nice!

1591
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:08,540
Okay.

1592
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,840
And now you...

1593
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:12,640
Nice!

1594
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:12,900
Okay.

1595
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:14,920
Nice!

1596
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:15,660
Okay.

1597
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,020
They're so particular.

1598
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,000
I think we got all of them.

1599
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,000
Nope, I hear one more.

1600
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:22,920
I hear one more.

1601
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,040
Oh god!

1602
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,500
I think I can hit it from here.

1603
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:43,100
There I can hit it.

1604
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,800
Or if I had good aim.

1605
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,300
Or if I had good aim.

1606
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,900
Second R2, man.

1607
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:55,800
Second R2, man.

1608
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:55,800
Okay.

1609
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,120
Okay, sorry.

1610
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,440
I just like to be safe.

1611
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,760
I don't want anybody to catch me.

1612
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:00,880
I just like to be safe.

1613
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:00,880
I don't want anybody to catch me.

1614
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,360
Anything like that.

1615
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,220
Where am I going?

1616
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,240
Her aim is just like mine for real for you?

1617
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:10,900
Really good?

1618
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:11,180
Really good?

1619
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,400
Really good?

1620
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,540
I'm going to the core of Shell 2.

1621
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:18,700
Get to the core of Shell 2.

1622
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,240
The core of Shell 2.

1623
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,080
Before the enemy can use him to reconfirm the nuclear launch code.

1624
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,560
The core of Shell 2.

1625
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,080
So it's not this one.

1626
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,440
What's over here anyway?

1627
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:38,870
I can't go in here.

1628
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:39,390
No.

1629
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:41,550
Beep beep.

1630
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,310
Shell 2, baby.

1631
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:46,710
Hmm.

1632
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:48,210
Hmm.

1633
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:48,390
Hmm.

1634
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:52,550
Is that guy still up there?

1635
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,250
Where does he go?

1636
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:55,010
Okay.

1637
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,950
Are you guys ready to believe?

1638
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,730
That was just a test.

1639
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:11,930
Do you guys still believe in me?

1640
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:12,250
Right?

1641
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:15,090
Oh my god, Raiden.

1642
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:16,270
Oh my god, Raiden.

1643
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:20,270
Why can't you walk in a straight line, buddy?

1644
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,630
You're a proud friend of mine.

1645
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,250
Gosh.

1646
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:30,970
If I were a bird, I would not be hanging around this place any longer.

1647
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:33,590
Okay, okay.

1648
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:35,470
You can do it.

1649
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:38,910
I wonder if I... yeah.

1650
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,470
Oh gosh.

1651
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:54,430
I believe I can do it.

1652
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:56,950
I have trauma from this area.

1653
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:01,150
Gamer.

1654
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,080
Olga!

1655
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:16,460
My father had some unfinished business with him.

1656
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:17,440
Olga.

1657
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:18,640
Calm yourself.

1658
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,620
Your personal feelings.

1659
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:27,160
Then screw your plan.

1660
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,760
I've been waiting for this day for two years.

1661
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,400
And I will send him to the bottom of the ocean.

1662
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,740
Right next to my old man.

1663
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,300
She's not gonna see you.

1664
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,220
The launch comes first.

1665
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:42,580
Very convincing.

1666
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,520
I don't trust him.

1667
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:48,360
Don't talk that way about one of your own.

1668
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,580
He's not one of my own.

1669
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,680
He left my father to die.

1670
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,100
Remember?

1671
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,240
Olga, we'll talk later.

1672
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,140
We need to get started on the final checks for the unit.

1673
01:09:58,900 --> 01:09:59,380
Alright.

1674
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,200
I'm headed back there.

1675
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:01,640
Okay.

1676
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,780
The upper connecting bridge to Shell One is down.

1677
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,320
What about the chopper?

1678
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,800
The cam-off is out of action.

1679
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,200
Take the oil fence from Strut L.

1680
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,240
Okay.

1681
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:13,920
I'll tell my men to start pulling out.

1682
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:15,460
Not yet.

1683
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,620
Their retrieval comes last.

1684
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:20,060
The intruder is still at large.

1685
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:21,800
Snake.

1686
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,320
What about the other man?

1687
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,900
He's got luck on his side, certainly.

1688
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,620
He survived that explosion.

1689
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:32,680
Snake.

1690
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:33,360
Listen, Olga.

1691
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,360
The code confirmation is in one hour.

1692
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:39,160
Keep the president alive until then.

1693
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:39,500
Okay.

1694
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,160
Easy.

1695
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:40,440
I know.

1696
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,300
No one gets in here.

1697
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:43,960
Keep him alive.

1698
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:44,540
Keep him alive.

1699
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:45,840
Of course.

1700
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,580
Keep him al- Oh, the currents.

1701
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:49,440
What does that mean?

1702
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:51,800
Uh-oh.

1703
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:52,700
Uh-oh!

1704
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:55,740
Uh-oh!

1705
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,480
The door stays shut unless the president manages to take out that circuit panel.

1706
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,480
I could do it.

1707
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:04,560
I would win.

1708
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,340
With my bare hands.

1709
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:09,640
I almost said I could do it with my bare hands.

1710
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:10,620
I almost said I could do it with my bare hands.

1711
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,340
We leave for Russia when this business is done.

1712
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,840
I want half the money for that.

1713
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,160
Of course.

1714
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,060
That was part of the agreement.

1715
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,620
My bare hands.

1716
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,080
We start living for ourselves after this.

1717
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:27,160
If there's anyone who wants to stay here, I want you to take good care of them.

1718
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,200
Gladly.

1719
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:29,180
Of course he will.

1720
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,280
Cream of the crop.

1721
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,780
It's time they went free.

1722
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:34,660
Are they?

1723
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,960
What happened to rebuilding Mother Russia?

1724
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,380
Cream of the crop?

1725
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:41,260
The world is a different place now.

1726
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,520
Cream of the crop.

1727
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,820
Just as a reminder, I'm going to say this again.

1728
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:47,560
One last time.

1729
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,620
Don't try anything on us.

1730
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,540
They just built this room with high voltage floors.

1731
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:53,620
With the contractor.

1732
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:54,920
I know, right?

1733
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:57,380
Oh, man.

1734
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,800
I'm in front of the room where they're keeping the president.

1735
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,120
Everything all right?

1736
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,700
No sign of flooding.

1737
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,840
But I can't get close to the door.

1738
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,720
The floor is electrified.

1739
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,120
Don't test it.

1740
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:12,000
You'll be bacon.

1741
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,380
Any suggestions?

1742
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:16,140
Remember the Shadow Moses VR training?

1743
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,960
Take out the circuit panel?

1744
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:18,800
Right.

1745
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,940
When did I do this in Shadow Moses?

1746
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:23,640
Try ventilation ducts.

1747
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:25,680
I think I see one.

1748
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,420
Look for a remote control missile launcher.

1749
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:28,940
Okay.

1750
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,420
You can guide it through the duct.

1751
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,640
Oh, wait.

1752
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,460
I did do this.

1753
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,980
Target the circuit panel.

1754
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:34,860
Got it.

1755
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,000
Make sure you don't hit the president.

1756
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:38,660
Mr. President!

1757
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,020
The president is wired with nanomachines.

1758
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:45,420
John Segan is one of my favorite VHS series.

1759
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:46,340
I love Solidus.

1760
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:46,380
Me too.

1761
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:51,080
It looks like the walls have a built-in radio shield.

1762
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,340
I was thinking with the ducts.

1763
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,160
With the ducts.

1764
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,160
I was like, I never launched a missile through ducts.

1765
01:12:59,160 --> 01:12:59,280
Understood.

1766
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,140
Ducts.

1767
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:03,100
Ducts.

1768
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:04,520
Ducts?

1769
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,660
Oh, God.

1770
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:08,960
This is where I was hiding?

1771
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:09,600
Oh, my God.

1772
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:14,100
Sorry.

1773
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,100
Oh, God.

1774
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,600
I see this...

1775
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:23,740
I see this hallway and I want to start crying every time.

1776
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,580
Mr. President!

1777
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:29,960
Can you hear me?

1778
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,820
I have like a...

1779
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:36,020
I think this is why I'm a ghost, honestly.

1780
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,520
I have a trauma from...

1781
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,920
From just this room.

1782
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,160
From just...

1783
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:42,660
Oh, hello?

1784
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:43,700
What is this?

1785
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,600
Oh, I got to get the Nikita first.

1786
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,120
Thank you.

1787
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:59,940
I remember there not being any guys around here yet.

1788
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:00,020
Yeah.

1789
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,500
Oh, yeah.

1790
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,080
My rations.

1791
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:07,720
Oh, this one?

1792
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,580
Has a bunch of things in here.

1793
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,800
Anyone else?

1794
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,040
Oh.

1795
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,460
That's it though, right?

1796
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:24,740
Anybody?

1797
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,020
Anyone else?

1798
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,900
I don't see anyone.

1799
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:30,980
I don't see anyone.

1800
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:35,640
Oh!

1801
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,700
Oh, I thought it was the actual thing.

1802
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:40,500
I'm so stupid.

1803
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:41,720
What's that?

1804
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:45,140
Nothing here.

1805
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:47,600
Chaff.

1806
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,460
Yeah, it's just the ammo.

1807
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:52,540
I thought it was the actual thing.

1808
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:52,940
I forgot.

1809
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,460
And this...

1810
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:56,880
Why would there be... Oh, here's the nerd.

1811
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,680
Why would there be security cameras in the...

1812
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,040
In the break room?

1813
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:10,270
Mr. President!

1814
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:12,570
He's close to the wall.

1815
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:16,050
Oh my god!

1816
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:18,510
It's just like in MDS1 when you see Otacon!

1817
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:20,510
Who's there?

1818
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:22,670
Come here, come here.

1819
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:25,350
Come here, come here.

1820
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:27,210
Come here.

1821
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:28,150
Who?

1822
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:30,590
Who's there?

1823
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:30,990
Who's there?

1824
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:34,390
Is that a Metal Gear Solid reference?

1825
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:35,550
Who's that?

1826
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:36,870
Knock it off!

1827
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:46,450
I don't remember the music being so loud in this game.

1828
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:47,550
Where the...

1829
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,030
Voice acting is not so loud.

1830
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:51,590
You know what I mean?

1831
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:55,610
I don't remember.

1832
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:56,790
Where do I get...

1833
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:00,290
The Nikita missile?

1834
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,390
Where do I get it?

1835
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:06,310
Colonel!

1836
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,940
The only way to the President is past this electrified floor.

1837
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,680
Use the remote-controlled missile to destroy the power source.

1838
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,660
That will cut off the high-voltage current to the floor.

1839
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:22,300
Locate a remote-controlled missile.

1840
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,240
Turning it down?

1841
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:23,600
I wonder.

1842
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:27,040
Do you guys think the audio is okay though?

1843
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:28,680
Oh, Snake.

1844
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,780
Do you guys think the audio is okay?

1845
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,380
If you can hear?

1846
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:31,900
Alright.

1847
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,340
I don't want it to be too low.

1848
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:35,360
I feel like this is one of those games where like...

1849
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,960
The audio should be as loud as me.

1850
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:38,200
The audio should be as loud as me.

1851
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:39,580
Sounds good?

1852
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:39,860
Okay.

1853
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,400
What can I do for you, Jack?

1854
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,840
I wanna hear some drama.

1855
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,380
You got any drama for me, Rose?

1856
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:49,000
You got any drama for me, Rose?

1857
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,620
Rose, oh Rose, my beloved.

1858
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,080
Still windows.

1859
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,880
Oh, 10 hours, exactly!

1860
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,480
Jack, have you remembered what day it is tomorrow?

1861
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:03,320
Jack, have you remembered what day it is tomorrow?

1862
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,880
You said you had something you wanted to talk to me about.

1863
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:06,940
What was it?

1864
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,560
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

1865
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,860
Why does it have to be tomorrow?

1866
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,780
So I can build up enough courage first.

1867
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,100
And so you won't run away.

1868
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,180
I would never do something like that.

1869
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,080
Liar.

1870
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:23,920
Every time I wanna talk about something, you suddenly remember that you have some work you have to do.

1871
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,080
Or you get a stomach ache.

1872
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,280
If that's not...

1873
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,940
You know it's true.

1874
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,700
What are you so afraid of?

1875
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,160
There you go again.

1876
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,000
And I won't try to run away.

1877
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,880
You are such a liar, Raiden.

1878
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,160
Well then, we'll talk tomorrow.

1879
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,320
So you have to come back, okay?

1880
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:42,100
Sorry, Rose.

1881
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,440
We can't do anything tonight.

1882
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,840
I got a headache, you know?

1883
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,000
He's still here.

1884
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:47,220
What?

1885
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:47,840
Give it up?

1886
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:50,100
He's like, this wall!

1887
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:53,160
What's up with this wall?

1888
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:54,680
Oh, let me call Snake.

1889
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,080
That's right.

1890
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,960
Oh my god, it even says Snake now!

1891
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:00,460
Bye, Snake.

1892
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:01,100
Thank you so much.

1893
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,300
Snake, do you know where I can find some remote control?

1894
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:03,900
Remote controlled missiles?

1895
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,140
Remote controlled missiles?

1896
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:09,440
I saw something on B1 in the core of Shell 2.

1897
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:10,720
But be careful.

1898
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,500
Contaminated seawater is broken out of the tanks.

1899
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,560
Thanks to that explosion.

1900
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,240
Most of B1 is probably flooded by now.

1901
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:17,760
We gotta swim.

1902
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,480
We gotta swim.

1903
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,040
We gotta swim.

1904
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,360
We gotta swim.

1905
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,460
We gotta swim.

1906
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:27,720
Oh, ping pong!

1907
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:32,780
Mr. President.

1908
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:32,880
Mr. President.

1909
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:35,520
Who's there?

1910
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,160
Who's there?

1911
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,440
Ding-dong-ditch.

1912
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,400
Time to avoid drowning?

1913
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,960
Yes, but also no.

1914
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:48,080
Yes, but not yet.

1915
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,040
Yes, but soon.

1916
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,960
I hope there's no bugs down here.

1917
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:54,900
I hate those.

1918
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,140
I don't see a way.

1919
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:10,800
I don't see a way to...

1920
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,760
make the music...

1921
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,140
You know, back in the day, they didn't really have options like that.

1922
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,160
To increase the music and also...

1923
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,520
Like, you know, or turn down the music.

1924
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:21,200
Things like that.

1925
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:22,660
Alright.

1926
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:24,940
I'm new here.

1927
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,320
Welcome.

1928
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,580
Get ready for peak gameplay.

1929
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,080
Oh gosh, I forgot how to swim.

1930
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:31,900
Colonel!

1931
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,480
Colonel, teach me how to swim!

1932
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:36,300
Colonel!

1933
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:36,580
Colonel!

1934
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,060
I forgot how to swim.

1935
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:49,440
When you're on the surface, you can swim in corresponding directions using the up, down, left, and right movement of the left analog stick.

1936
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:49,660
using the up, down, left, and right movement of the left analog stick.

1937
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:49,960
Thank you.

1938
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:53,100
Push the punch button to dive down from the surface.

1939
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:53,500
Okay, okay.

1940
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:58,340
Now, look at the cans.

1941
01:19:58,720 --> 01:19:59,240
Now, look at the cans.

1942
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:03,450
Now, where...

1943
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:07,030
Okay, I keep thinking that the blue parts are...

1944
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:07,650
Okay, I keep thinking that the blue parts are...

1945
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:09,510
Oh god.

1946
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:10,430
Ow!

1947
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:12,310
Why are you calling me underwater?

1948
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:16,290
Colonel, B1 is completely flooded from what I can see.

1949
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:16,370
What?

1950
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:16,370
How?

1951
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:16,570
Bryden?

1952
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:17,590
Are you a mermaid?

1953
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:17,970
What?

1954
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:19,870
I'm fine with swimming.

1955
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:20,490
Merman?

1956
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:24,050
Okay.

1957
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:25,090
I'm stroking.

1958
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:26,370
Okay.

1959
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,030
Looks at the cans.

1960
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:31,530
Yeah, you would...

1961
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:32,930
You're talking fast.

1962
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:34,930
...left and right to face those directions.

1963
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,410
The O2 gauge will appear...

1964
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:39,410
You're under your life gauge while you're underwater.

1965
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:43,750
The gauge corresponds to the amount of air you can hold from a single deep breath.

1966
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:46,010
Once the O2 gauge falls to zero...

1967
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:46,330
I'm gonna die, Colonel.

1968
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,530
Colonel, I'm gonna drown.

1969
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:50,950
Colonel, I'm gonna drown.

1970
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:51,810
Colonel.

1971
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:56,350
Oh, gosh.

1972
01:20:57,170 --> 01:20:57,610
Oh, gosh.

1973
01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:01,310
Colonel, I'm gonna drown.

1974
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:02,110
Okay.

1975
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:03,510
Okay.

1976
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:11,290
There was something down there, wasn't there?

1977
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:13,630
I don't...

1978
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:14,370
You know what?

1979
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:15,550
Let's just explore.

1980
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:17,590
Because I truly don't remember where to get it.

1981
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,260
Oh, this is a dead end.

1982
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:29,680
Isn't it?

1983
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:30,260
Wow.

1984
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:30,960
Good job.

1985
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:31,900
Idiot.

1986
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:33,780
Oh, wait.

1987
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:34,680
Yeah.

1988
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,340
There we go.

1989
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,380
Yeah, we're just gonna go on an adventure.

1990
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:41,710
Yeah, we're just gonna go on an adventure.

1991
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:42,450
A little adventure.

1992
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,650
A little adventure.

1993
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:47,430
You know what?

1994
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:50,430
The game has really traumatized me with, um...

1995
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:53,070
With, uh...

1996
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:55,270
Oh, there was something in that room, wasn't there?

1997
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:57,770
Oh, la la.

1998
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,290
Looks like a certain...

1999
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:02,850
Traitor.

2000
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:05,310
Kingdom Hearts 2.

2001
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:08,190
That game...

2002
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:08,770
Hold on.

2003
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:09,810
I wanna go check this room again.

2004
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:11,550
I'm pretty sure there was something in here.

2005
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:14,630
That game has the worst...

2006
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:15,410
Swimming...

2007
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:16,130
Oh!

2008
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:17,410
Night vision goggles!

2009
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:18,110
There we go.

2010
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:20,490
You're welcome, everybody.

2011
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,190
You don't even have to tell me.

2012
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:26,450
Kingdom Hearts 2 had the...

2013
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:28,330
Absolute worst...

2014
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:30,170
Swimming mechanics ever.

2015
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:31,350
It was so bad.

2016
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:33,390
Oh, wait.

2017
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:34,490
Was it 2 or 1?

2018
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:36,510
Maybe it was 1.

2019
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:38,410
Kingdom Hearts 2...

2020
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:39,310
Had the rhythm game.

2021
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:41,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2022
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:42,290
Kingdom Hearts 1...

2023
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,610
Was the really bad one.

2024
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:44,610
Kingdom Hearts 2 had the rhythm game.

2025
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:46,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2026
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:47,950
Who the heck swims like that?

2027
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:50,870
I don't... I think by this point...

2028
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:52,250
We know Raiden is not okay.

2029
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:56,070
Raiden's a bit of a freaky guy.

2030
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:58,950
Oh my god!

2031
01:22:59,070 --> 01:22:59,390
Raiden!

2032
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:16,280
Rubber ducky!

2033
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,420
I'll be honest.

2034
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,360
I thought the mines...

2035
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,240
Showed up...

2036
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,020
In the second part.

2037
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:33,120
I'll be honest.

2038
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:34,600
That's my bad.

2039
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:36,660
For not remembering.

2040
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:38,940
There it is.

2041
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:47,710
Okay.

2042
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:53,450
Okay.

2043
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:56,750
Okay.

2044
01:23:57,350 --> 01:23:58,250
Don't rush me.

2045
01:23:58,330 --> 01:23:59,630
I'm already drowning...

2046
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:00,030
In here.

2047
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:01,510
I'm drowning...

2048
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:01,950
In time.

2049
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:04,090
Oh gosh.

2050
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:07,670
Is there a...

2051
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:08,750
Oh gosh.

2052
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:09,350
Wait.

2053
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:09,550
Wait.

2054
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:09,710
Wait.

2055
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:09,850
Wait.

2056
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:10,090
Wait.

2057
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:10,550
Up.

2058
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:10,810
Up.

2059
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:11,030
Up.

2060
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:12,030
Up.

2061
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:13,170
Up.

2062
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:13,410
Up.

2063
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:13,570
Up.

2064
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:13,670
Up.

2065
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:14,870
Oh god.

2066
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:15,290
Oh god.

2067
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:15,610
Oh god.

2068
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:16,690
I'm really not okay.

2069
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:19,310
We're fine.

2070
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:21,470
I'm just...

2071
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:22,730
Bleeding out a little bit.

2072
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:24,270
I have some bandages.

2073
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:25,270
Don't worry about it everybody.

2074
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:27,510
There we go.

2075
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,400
Was there anything in here?

2076
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,120
This is where we go to later.

2077
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:38,880
So we have to...

2078
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,800
Go find the president first.

2079
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:40,300
Okay.

2080
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,880
Glad I went down here though.

2081
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:43,420
Now I remember.

2082
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:54,270
What is that?

2083
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:55,190
Right there.

2084
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:55,670
Floating.

2085
01:24:57,810 --> 01:24:58,850
Is there anything over here?

2086
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:00,230
Oh gosh.

2087
01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:00,910
Right in.

2088
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:05,170
I forgot your thing goes down faster because you have less health.

2089
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:05,490
I forgot your thing goes down faster because you have less health.

2090
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:06,250
Go up.

2091
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:10,530
It's the raven figurine?

2092
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:11,210
Wait.

2093
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:11,570
Actually?

2094
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:16,990
Are you a mint enough maid to rescue the president?

2095
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:17,290
Are you a mint enough maid to rescue the president?

2096
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:18,450
Of course I am!

2097
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:20,390
I won't let anything happen to the president.

2098
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:21,190
Don't worry.

2099
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:22,810
Scout's honor.

2100
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:24,230
Oh I'm running into a wall.

2101
01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:25,090
No.

2102
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,350
That probably didn't spark confidence in you.

2103
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:28,430
Scout's honor.

2104
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:29,690
Nothing will happen to the president.

2105
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:29,950
Scout's honor.

2106
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:29,950
Nothing will happen to the president.

2107
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,200
Ah.

2108
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:45,870
No mysterious heart attacks?

2109
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:46,230
No.

2110
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:47,930
None of that nonsense.

2111
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:49,210
What is this?

2112
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:49,870
Shadow Moses?

2113
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:50,650
No.

2114
01:25:50,690 --> 01:25:51,730
This is the big shell.

2115
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:54,510
We don't have stinking heart attacks here.

2116
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:55,550
Except for aims.

2117
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:57,690
But that guy already had a heart problem.

2118
01:25:57,830 --> 01:25:58,210
I think.

2119
01:25:58,410 --> 01:25:59,390
So you know...

2120
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:00,890
He doesn't count.

2121
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:00,970
He doesn't count.

2122
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:06,730
Raiden looks so stupid on the stairs.

2123
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:07,290
I love him.

2124
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:07,710
I know.

2125
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:08,090
Right?

2126
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:12,190
Okay Mr. President.

2127
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:15,410
Watch this.

2128
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:20,450
Idiot.

2129
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:21,650
Knock it off.

2130
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:24,050
Stupid president.

2131
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:26,610
The president's dumb.

2132
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:27,950
Um.

2133
01:26:31,090 --> 01:26:33,210
I wish I could get that other ration.

2134
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:35,710
The one that I didn't need earlier.

2135
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:36,250
Gosh.

2136
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:36,910
I ate two.

2137
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:38,490
I ate two.

2138
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:39,730
Dang.

2139
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:43,710
Mines in the water.

2140
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:45,150
And like destroyed all my health.

2141
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:47,710
Are these still down?

2142
01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:48,110
Yeah.

2143
01:26:51,370 --> 01:26:52,550
You're such a prankster.

2144
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:53,250
I know.

2145
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:56,970
I'm just a pranking guy.

2146
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:57,630
I'm just a pranking guy.

2147
01:26:57,630 --> 01:26:57,750
I'm just a pranking guy.

2148
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:01,580
Oh.

2149
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:02,060
Here we go.

2150
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,800
Swimming builds an appetite.

2151
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,280
I know.

2152
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,060
When I was a kid.

2153
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:09,940
Every time I would go swimming.

2154
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,920
My mom would make me peanut butter crackers.

2155
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:13,520
So I think about that.

2156
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:15,060
Ahhh.

2157
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:26,770
Press square to aim in first person.

2158
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:29,010
Press square to aim in first person.

2159
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:29,070
My

2160
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:35,420
best.

2161
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:39,280
He's really got child bearing hips from this angle.

2162
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:39,700
He's really got child bearing hips from this angle.

2163
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:44,100
Look at that indent.

2164
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:48,060
The sneaking suit lifts and separates the cheeks.

2165
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,700
To prevent them from laughing.

2166
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:50,440
I know.

2167
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,080
Look at that.

2168
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:53,740
They are spread open.

2169
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:56,780
Oh my.

2170
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:57,500
Riding.

2171
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:58,640
Oh.

2172
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,280
Wow.

2173
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:02,380
Oh.

2174
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:03,780
Golly.

2175
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:06,100
Riding.

2176
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:09,860
Spread open.

2177
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:10,320
Look at that.

2178
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:10,580
Look at them.

2179
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,180
Are they not?

2180
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:13,940
Alright.

2181
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,160
Don't worry about it, President.

2182
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,680
Don't worry about it, Mr. President.

2183
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:32,020
Oh my god.

2184
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:32,600
They are so fast.

2185
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,000
This way.

2186
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,140
Watch out, Mr. President.

2187
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,580
Watch out, Mr. President.

2188
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:46,380
Watch out, Mr. President.

2189
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:48,140
Hahaha.

2190
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,120
Hahaha.

2191
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:53,960
Mr. President.

2192
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:55,320
Trying to.

2193
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,080
Hahaha.

2194
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,120
Oh my.

2195
01:28:59,180 --> 01:28:59,440
Wait.

2196
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,500
I guess I can't get other stuff in there, can I?

2197
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,300
Not yet.

2198
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,080
Stop it.

2199
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,560
Stop sending that missile to me.

2200
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:08,580
Stop it.

2201
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:09,480
Hahaha.

2202
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,640
Stop launching missiles at me.

2203
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,100
What's wrong?

2204
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:15,780
Stop it.

2205
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,740
This is not funny.

2206
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,580
There we go.

2207
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:22,740
Okay.

2208
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:24,000
Time for funny cut scene.

2209
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,180
Mr. President.

2210
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:31,480
President Johnson.

2211
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:34,220
Happy birthday to you.

2212
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,460
So you're finally here.

2213
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:38,040
Happy birthday to you.

2214
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:42,080
Your equipment, that skull suit, isn't exactly standard military issue.

2215
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:43,560
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

2216
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,480
Are you all right, sir?

2217
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,140
Is this some kind of sick joke?

2218
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,040
I thought you came to kill me.

2219
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,040
Happy birthday to you.

2220
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:54,340
Happy birthday to you.

2221
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:56,760
I'm prepared to face the consequences of my betrayal.

2222
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:57,840
I'm prepared to face the consequences of my betrayal.

2223
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:58,240
What are you...

2224
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:00,140
What the...

2225
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,300
You're a man?

2226
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:03,600
I know.

2227
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,220
You can't tell by the cheeks, but...

2228
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:05,280
Well, who are you?

2229
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:07,660
Foxhound, sir.

2230
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:09,020
Foxhound?

2231
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:10,700
Raiden's totally unfazed.

2232
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:11,240
I see.

2233
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,240
Now things are starting to make a little sense.

2234
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:18,040
He was reminded of a previous life.

2235
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:19,660
He was reminded of a previous life.

2236
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:21,640
Whoa, grabby.

2237
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:24,740
Switch over to nano communication so nobody can listen in.

2238
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:25,780
Oh my god, Mr. President.

2239
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:27,160
My hog?

2240
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:30,940
Do you need me, sir?

2241
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:32,420
Yes.

2242
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,200
Surprise prostate check?

2243
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,300
I don't think that's where your prostate is.

2244
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:41,140
Have managed to input the code sequence necessary for launching a nuclear strike.

2245
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:42,800
I don't think that's where that is.

2246
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:43,240
That's correct.

2247
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:44,780
I punched the sequence in myself.

2248
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:46,340
You're working for them?

2249
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:49,860
If you asked me two hours ago, my answer would have been yes.

2250
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:50,360
If you asked me two hours ago, my answer would have been yes.

2251
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,280
Eureka, Sensei.

2252
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:51,540
Who's I?

2253
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:54,580
They're keeping me alive until my vital signs are reconfirmed.

2254
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:55,620
They betrayed you?

2255
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,400
I wouldn't quite put it that way.

2256
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,140
I wanted power.

2257
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:00,680
They sought destruction.

2258
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:01,360
Huh?

2259
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,020
But why stoop to terrorism?

2260
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,220
I wanted absolute power.

2261
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,040
Oh my god.

2262
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:06,760
You're the president.

2263
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,140
You have power.

2264
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:08,700
No.

2265
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:10,720
I'm just a figurehead.

2266
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:12,260
What's that supposed to mean?

2267
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:13,420
I don't have any control.

2268
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,200
The real power is in the Patriots' hands.

2269
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:17,600
The Patriots?

2270
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:19,680
The truth behind this country.

2271
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,740
I don't know anything.

2272
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,560
I'm not surprised you've never heard of them.

2273
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:24,900
Very few are aware of their existence.

2274
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:27,460
Even among those with code word clearance.

2275
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:28,780
Huh?

2276
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:31,600
Politics, the military, the economy.

2277
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,140
They control it all.

2278
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:35,280
They even choose who becomes president.

2279
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:39,440
Putting it simply, the Patriots rule this country.

2280
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:40,680
The Patriots?

2281
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,160
No.

2282
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,120
Hard to believe, isn't it?

2283
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:45,360
But it's the truth.

2284
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:51,980
The space defense, income tax reduction, and national missile defense programs.

2285
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:57,320
Every policy that's been credited to me was actually done according to their instructions.

2286
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:00,620
Space defense was initiated by Congress.

2287
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:03,440
That's what the Patriots want the country to believe.

2288
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:04,840
It's all a show.

2289
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,600
Democracy is just a filler for textbooks.

2290
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,060
Think about it.

2291
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:13,120
Do you actually believe that public opinion influences the government?

2292
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:13,880
No.

2293
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:17,700
This country is shaped and controlled as the Patriots see fit.

2294
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:19,740
The people are shown what they want to believe.

2295
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:24,860
What you call government is actually a well-staged production aimed at satisfying the public.

2296
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:25,880
Huh?

2297
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,820
Don't look at me like that.

2298
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:29,500
I'm legally sane, you know.

2299
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,580
It's not your sanity that worries me.

2300
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:32,600
Huh?

2301
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:34,840
Huh?

2302
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:36,660
The Patriots.

2303
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,560
Even I don't know who the actual members are.

2304
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:43,880
Are they financial, political, or military leaders?

2305
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:48,380
No one knows who the Patriots really are.

2306
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,700
Even my instructions come from a cutout.

2307
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:59,400
All I've been told is that every key decision is made by a group of 12 men known as the Wise Men's Committee.

2308
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,920
Wise guys.

2309
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:01,720
Your office?

2310
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:02,700
The White House?

2311
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:04,340
Merely puppets.

2312
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:05,860
Pawns in a game.

2313
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,080
Oh.

2314
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:12,080
By pledging my loyalty, an insignificant son of a senator was awarded the presidency.

2315
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,940
Of course, that wasn't the only price I had to pay.

2316
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:17,480
What do you mean?

2317
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:22,160
Even if a pawn becomes a queen, it is still just a playing piece.

2318
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,800
I wanted to leave my own mark in history.

2319
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,980
But my ambitions were to be a member of the Patriots.

2320
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:32,280
The guy in the bottom right looks like Van Gogh.

2321
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:33,540
You'll understand someday.

2322
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,820
You'll understand someday.

2323
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,780
I wished to be a member of the Patriots.

2324
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:43,560
I wanted to wield the power of a king instead of being an expendable pawn.

2325
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,240
I wished to be a member of the Patriots.

2326
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:47,460
And that justifies acts of terrorism?

2327
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:48,100
Yes.

2328
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:51,800
I'd intended to use the new metal gear as a bargaining chip.

2329
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:52,940
Bargaining chip?

2330
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:55,560
But I underestimated Solidus.

2331
01:33:55,560 --> 01:34:00,840
He actually wants to challenge the Patriots, even if it means the destruction of the world.

2332
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:02,080
What are you saying?

2333
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:06,880
Whether you believe it or not, the balance of power rests in the hands of the Patriots.

2334
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:15,300
They regulate the country's various interests through controlled presentation, staging a drama that is palatable to the general masses.

2335
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,360
Can you imagine what would happen if they ceased to function?

2336
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:24,440
Picture a massive political vacuum, getting rid of the Patriots.

2337
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:28,980
A space that every power monger will try to fill for their own greedy ends.

2338
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:30,760
It happened last week, you guys.

2339
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,580
I'm talking about an unregulated power struggle.

2340
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:33,720
Panic.

2341
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:34,620
Civil war.

2342
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:35,020
Chaos.

2343
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:35,400
Fox alive.

2344
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:41,020
Like it or not, the Patriots is an organization that must continue to exist.

2345
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:41,660
No they don't!

2346
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:45,260
So you changed your mind because you wanted to avoid global chaos.

2347
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:46,840
Global chaos.

2348
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:54,420
When I told Solidus that I wished to prevent disaster, he replied that pawns would never become players.

2349
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:57,120
And who is this Solidus?

2350
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:59,320
You don't recognize the president?

2351
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:00,840
My predecessor.

2352
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:02,820
George Sears.

2353
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:03,860
President Sears!

2354
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:05,920
That was the name the public came to know him by.

2355
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:09,500
I knew him by his code name, Solidus Snake.

2356
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,240
Why does nobody recognize the president?

2357
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,780
He was the third snake preceded by Solid and Liquid.

2358
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,700
A survivor of the Les Enfants Terribles project.

2359
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:17,740
Les Enfants Terribles?

2360
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:18,840
Neither solid nor liquid.

2361
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:24,120
He was a well-balanced masterpiece that the Patriots saw fit Handsome guy.

2362
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:29,100
However, he fell out of grace with the organization four years ago.

2363
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,800
When acting on his own, he started an incident.

2364
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:33,380
Four years ago?

2365
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,880
Why didn't you vote for him?

2366
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:37,440
That's right.

2367
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:48,740
At the time, the DARPA chief, Donald Anderson, together with certain influential parties, initiated the development of Metal Gear Rex and an advanced nuclear warhead.

2368
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:49,440
I voted for him.

2369
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:52,480
However, this did not fall in line with the Patriots' plans.

2370
01:35:52,740 --> 01:36:01,440
What's more, Solidus decided on his own to send his most trusted man, Ocelot, to provoke Liquid Snake, bringing about the said incident.

2371
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:06,680
As a result, he succeeded in obtaining Rex and the data on the warhead.

2372
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:12,820
But in doing so, he ended up revealing the existence of both Rex and the Genome Army.

2373
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:16,180
A blunder that earned him the wrath of the Patriots.

2374
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,740
That sounds like an awesome game name.

2375
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:20,340
The wrath of the Patriots?

2376
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:21,540
Solidus was removed from the presidential office.

2377
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,500
No, that is not Solid nor Liquid Snake!

2378
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,540
I thought he resigned.

2379
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,320
That's the story given to the general public.

2380
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:35,600
Following his resignation, the Patriots selected me, their new pawn, for the presidency.

2381
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,960
But that would mean that the presidential race was...

2382
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:41,100
That was quite a show, wasn't it?

2383
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:45,660
It was a well-scripted drama staged by the Patriots for the benefit of the public.

2384
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:47,600
What are your policies?

2385
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:50,480
It's the diaper chaff.

2386
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,340
The diaper chaff.

2387
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:53,900
Huh.

2388
01:36:54,600 --> 01:37:01,220
Following his resignation, Solidus' health was scheduled to fail him, bringing about his untimely death.

2389
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:02,140
Capped?

2390
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:02,900
Correct.

2391
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:08,900
But before the Patriots could execute their plot, Solidus went underground with the help of Ocelot.

2392
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:16,340
As he avoided pursuit, Solidus gained control of Dead Cell, winning over Colonel Golukovich's outfit.

2393
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:21,520
From there, he bided his time knowing that his opportunity would soon arrive.

2394
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:22,660
What opportunity?

2395
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:25,580
The completion of the new Metal Gear project.

2396
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:30,140
An opportunity that would even his odds against the Patriots.

2397
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:36,700
By stealing the Patriots' most valued project, he would be able to place them in a very uncomfortable position.

2398
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,320
It's the only chance he has for survival.

2399
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:39,440
You make me uncomfortable.

2400
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:44,200
Once he has the new Metal Gear, he'll declare war against the Patriots.

2401
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:45,020
Yeah!

2402
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:46,480
No!

2403
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,880
Metal Gear is already operational.

2404
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:49,680
No.

2405
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:50,040
Not yet.

2406
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,720
He's jealous of the other two and Big Boss.

2407
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,920
What you saw was Metal Gear Ray.

2408
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,300
Hijacked two years ago from the Marines by Ocelot.

2409
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:59,220
That was not the new Metal Gear.

2410
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:00,820
Show me the Wikipedia article.

2411
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:01,300
Then where's the new Metal Gear?

2412
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:02,840
Right here.

2413
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:05,360
You're standing in it.

2414
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:10,300
To be more precise, this entire Big Shell facility is the new Metal Gear.

2415
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:11,340
What'd you say?

2416
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,420
What'd you say?

2417
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:16,320
I love Raiden.

2418
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:19,020
I love Raiden.

2419
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:20,220
What'd you say?

2420
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:23,720
The main structure extends from the foundation all the way down to the ocean floor.

2421
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:29,360
The connecting elevator is located on the B2 floor of the Shell 1 core.

2422
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:30,880
Arsenal Gear.

2423
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:34,740
That's the code name for the new Metal Gear.

2424
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:35,720
Arsenal?

2425
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:39,360
Nobody gives love to Arsenal Gear enough.

2426
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:40,840
He's a big ol' turtle.

2427
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:47,040
We're talking about an impregnable fortress carrying a load of over a couple of thousand missiles, including nuclear warheads.

2428
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:51,540
All protected by a horde of mass-produced Metal Gear Ray units.

2429
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,160
Mass-produced?

2430
01:38:53,320 --> 01:39:00,680
The Ray unit was originally designed for the Marines to be used as a countermeasure against the Metal Gear variations throughout the world.

2431
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:05,240
The Patriots had Ray redesigned to protect the new Arsenal Gear.

2432
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:09,300
So now anti-Metal Gears are guarding a Metal Gear.

2433
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:11,080
Ironic, isn't it?

2434
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:12,220
That's not all.

2435
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:21,580
Arsenal Gear has full access to the military's tactical network, giving it the ability to exercise absolute control over our nation's armed forces.

2436
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,000
Not to mention our nuclear armament.

2437
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:27,860
In short, Arsenal was created to be the core of our country.

2438
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:30,020
What kind of idiotic weapon?

2439
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:30,620
Weapon?

2440
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:31,440
No.

2441
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:33,160
You're not seeing the full picture.

2442
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:36,780
Arsenal Gear is more than just a military tool.

2443
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:42,960
It is a means to preserve the world as it is.

2444
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:45,280
It will establish a new form of control.

2445
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:49,440
The Patriots will use it to keep their place as the country's true rulers.

2446
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:52,140
Right now, they feel pressured and threatened.

2447
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:53,200
By what?

2448
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:56,640
They fear an overabundance of digital information.

2449
01:39:56,940 --> 01:40:01,260
The world will drown in the coming flood of information, and they along with it.

2450
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:10,960
The Arsenal plans include a system to digitally manage the flow of information, making it possible to shape the truth for their own purposes.

2451
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:15,180
In short, the Arsenal system is the key to their supremacy.

2452
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:16,340
The key?

2453
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,160
Yes.

2454
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,920
The GW system GW!

2455
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:20,880
is the Patriots' trump card.

2456
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:26,460
Arsenal Gear will be fully operational when GW is successfully integrated.

2457
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:32,280
Once operational, it will be a completely new form of power for the Patriots to wield.

2458
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:34,500
Ryden is just like, what are you talking about?

2459
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:37,980
I had hoped to seize the project from them and be in a strong bargaining position.

2460
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:38,360
GW?

2461
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,660
Bargain for what?

2462
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:43,140
I'd hoped to trade my way into their ranks.

2463
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:45,540
The Solidus preferred rebellion.

2464
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:46,800
I love Solidus!

2465
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:50,340
His only crime was gunpowder!

2466
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:57,020
To break the Patriots' control of the business community is also a key factor in his offensive effort.

2467
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,120
Outer Heaven?

2468
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:00,700
Listen, there isn't much time.

2469
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,180
The football served as the key for activating Arsenal Gear.

2470
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:07,020
I've already input the necessary code sequence.

2471
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:15,980
It won't be long before GW begins to establish connections with other external systems and Arsenal Gear becomes fully operational.

2472
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:18,180
Stop them before that happens.

2473
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:19,720
That is your role.

2474
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,960
You've got to find Emma Emmerich.

2475
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:26,440
She's the only one who can stop that thing once it's been activated.

2476
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:31,140
She's the system programmer for Arsenal Gear.

2477
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:32,960
Everything is going over Ryder's head right now.

2478
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:35,320
I believe she's somewhere on level B1 in the core of this building.

2479
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:37,880
I thought the levels below us were flooded.

2480
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:43,160
I'm sure they won't let her die just yet as she's the only remaining programmer for this project.

2481
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:50,080
According to Ocelot, she was being held in a locker room located in the northwest part of level B1.

2482
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:50,700
What do you mean?

2483
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:52,740
They're just not going to let her die, but it's flooded.

2484
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:56,840
They're going to stop the ocean?

2485
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:00,340
This is card four.

2486
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:03,060
I'll give you access all the way to Emma's location.

2487
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:03,500
Yippee!

2488
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,560
Give this to her when you find her.

2489
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:07,200
What is it?

2490
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:11,420
A program for disrupting the control functions between GW and Arsenal Gear.

2491
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:12,440
I hope your suit is waterproof.

2492
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:15,260
Take Emma to the computer room on level B2.

2493
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,720
Shell 1 core.

2494
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,140
She'll know how to load the program into the main system.

2495
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:20,200
A virus?

2496
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,040
That's right.

2497
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:22,340
Modeled after Foxty.

2498
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:27,620
A biological weapon designed to selectively eliminate personnel with a specific genetic code.

2499
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:29,140
But why do you have it?

2500
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:31,760
It's a failsafe.

2501
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,780
And Ocelot forgot to search me.

2502
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:34,380
He's the president!

2503
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,320
Why wouldn't he have it?

2504
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:37,420
That disk is the only way you're going to stop Arsenal.

2505
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:38,300
Okay.

2506
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:41,400
Do you feel IBS?

2507
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:43,820
Do you feel a little funny?

2508
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:46,620
Well, I've told you everything you need to know.

2509
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:47,040
Yeah.

2510
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:49,740
Okay, bye.

2511
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:52,600
There's only one thing that remains to be done.

2512
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:53,140
What's that?

2513
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:57,920
Get you out of here, president.

2514
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,700
We're going to save you.

2515
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:00,580
Right now.

2516
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:01,480
Come with me.

2517
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:05,120
Now, kill me.

2518
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:05,560
No!

2519
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:08,980
There's no time to argue.

2520
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:11,920
My vital ID will start any second.

2521
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:15,220
If you kill me now, you'll at least prevent the nuclear strike.

2522
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:15,840
No!

2523
01:43:16,820 --> 01:43:17,680
Cut it out!

2524
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:18,640
Do it!

2525
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:20,220
That's your role!

2526
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,860
That's not my role!

2527
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,880
It wasn't me!

2528
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:28,060
I didn't pull the trigger!

2529
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:29,940
It wasn't me!

2530
01:43:30,860 --> 01:43:32,280
I didn't do it!

2531
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:35,080
That's abusing your right to free speech, Mr. President.

2532
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,560
Oh my god!

2533
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:38,640
Ex-president.

2534
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,560
The president!

2535
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:41,880
Why did you...

2536
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:44,900
Alas, my finger must have slipped.

2537
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:50,660
I'll see you around, carrier boy.

2538
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:53,380
Oh my god!

2539
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:54,280
Don't forget him.

2540
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:00,040
Without free will, Why would Ocelot do that?

2541
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:02,560
there is no difference between submission and rebellion.

2542
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,040
Carrier boy.

2543
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:10,140
My only real choice is to put an end to this charade.

2544
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:15,900
Let me at least have the freedom to end it myself.

2545
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,500
Always question Ocelot's motives.

2546
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:20,100
What are you?

2547
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:20,780
Find Emma.

2548
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:21,820
Okay.

2549
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:23,900
Stop Arsenal.

2550
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:24,760
Okay.

2551
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:26,140
Order.

2552
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:27,840
As your commander in chief.

2553
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,520
I'm counting on you.

2554
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:31,480
Mr.

2555
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:36,500
President.

2556
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:39,480
Oh no.

2557
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:40,840
Mr. President.

2558
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:45,820
Mr. President, I'll take you somewhere nice.

2559
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:46,620
Come here.

2560
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:48,920
Come here, Mr. President.

2561
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:50,480
Come here.

2562
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:53,320
Come here, Mr. President.

2563
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,020
Okay.

2564
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:56,340
Just rest.

2565
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:58,640
Rest there, Mr. President.

2566
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:01,540
Rest well, Mr. President.

2567
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:02,920
Oh my god.

2568
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:05,980
07 for Mr. President.

2569
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:07,900
07 for Mr. President.

2570
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:08,260
Nice.

2571
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:09,000
More bullets.

2572
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:11,500
Um.

2573
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:13,180
Um.

2574
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:14,920
Colonel?

2575
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:16,160
We have a problem.

2576
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,620
No response?

2577
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,300
What else could you be doing?

2578
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:22,960
Snake?

2579
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:25,800
No response!

2580
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:29,040
What else could you guys be doing?

2581
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:32,280
No response!

2582
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:34,600
Oh, wait.

2583
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:36,840
Okay, I have one last person.

2584
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:37,740
He'll always pick up.

2585
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:43,480
No!

2586
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:47,300
The room is jammed?

2587
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:49,940
Then why do I still have my map?

2588
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:49,980
Then why do I still have my map?

2589
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:57,180
Wait, hold on.

2590
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:06,620
We got goodies to get.

2591
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,300
We got goodies to get, everybody.

2592
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,200
We got goodies to get, everybody.

2593
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:21,400
We got goodies to get, everybody.

2594
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:22,400
What else is in here?

2595
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:24,080
Oh, am I stuck?

2596
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:25,400
Oh.

2597
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:25,620
Oop.

2598
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:28,420
There.

2599
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:29,940
I can't go any further?

2600
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:31,300
No way!

2601
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:32,620
That's it?

2602
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:33,340
That's it for me?

2603
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:39,760
Okay.

2604
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:40,240
Okay.

2605
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:43,180
How?

2606
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:44,300
How am I stuck though?

2607
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:48,040
I can't bel...

2608
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:51,420
This doesn't seem like the type of game that would do an invisible wall, you know?

2609
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,300
This doesn't seem like the type of game that would do an invisible wall, you know?

2610
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:57,540
Battle Gear never seems like the type of game that does an invisible wall.

2611
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:00,500
What is this guy?

2612
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:02,660
Uh...

2613
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:04,060
Colonel, the President is dead.

2614
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:05,100
I see.

2615
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:06,860
I'm sorry to hear that.

2616
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:08,240
Where do we go from here?

2617
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:11,960
Your mission was to rescue the President and eliminate the terrorist threat.

2618
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:12,580
Oh, well...

2619
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:16,580
However, given the recent turn of events, we will honor the President's last directive.

2620
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:20,160
You must put a stop to Arsenal gear once and for all.

2621
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:20,500
Yes.

2622
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:26,600
Do you actually think there's any truth to his story about this big shell facility being a front for Arsenal gear?

2623
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:30,000
I don't have the security clearance necessary to verify the facts.

2624
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:32,000
However, he was the President.

2625
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:33,420
He was the President.

2626
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:34,200
I'm sure he knew what he was talking about.

2627
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:36,980
Aren't you forgetting that he was part of the terrorist plot?

2628
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:40,320
All the more reason why I believe his information is reliable.

2629
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:41,140
Huh?

2630
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:42,400
Maybe.

2631
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:44,760
Maybe.

2632
01:47:46,940 --> 01:47:47,220
Maybe.

2633
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:48,020
Maybe.

2634
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:48,460
Maybe.

2635
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:54,120
Ooooooh.

2636
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:57,840
Gah!

2637
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:10,160
The Colonel has a point, Jack.

2638
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:10,700
Hey!

2639
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:13,220
Yeah!

2640
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:16,880
Ugh...

2641
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,600
What are you talking about?

2642
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:20,140
Find Emma.

2643
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,880
She's supposed to be located on level B1.

2644
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:23,560
B1.

2645
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:24,660
In the core of that building you're in.

2646
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:24,960
Yep.

2647
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:25,200
Right?

2648
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:29,060
You've got to find her before Arsenal becomes fully operational.

2649
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:29,420
Okay.

2650
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:30,020
Hurry, Jack.

2651
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:34,800
It's up to you to make sure that the President didn't sacrifice his life in vain.

2652
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:35,160
Okay.

2653
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:36,120
Understood.

2654
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:37,460
Raiden, out.

2655
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:40,980
When do you ever say that?

2656
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:42,540
What's your status, Raiden?

2657
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,680
Snake, the President, he's been assassinated.

2658
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:46,380
What?

2659
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,720
There was nothing I could do.

2660
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:49,440
What about the nuclear strike guard?

2661
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:52,920
He died before his vital ID could be reconfirmed.

2662
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:56,580
When does he ever say that?

2663
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:59,460
But that Ocelot guy obviously killed the President on purpose.

2664
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:00,200
Why?

2665
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:01,900
It doesn't make any sense.

2666
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:05,520
They had to know that they couldn't launch the nuke if they killed the President.

2667
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:09,000
Maybe there's a way to launch without reconfirming the vital ID.

2668
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:12,660
Or maybe they found a more effective weapon within Arsenal gear.

2669
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:14,720
You knew about Arsenal gear?

2670
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:15,440
Yeah.

2671
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:17,180
Why didn't you tell me about it?

2672
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:17,600
You never asked.

2673
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:18,500
You never asked.

2674
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:23,000
I was just assuming you also know that the Big Shell's a front for the project.

2675
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:29,580
You mean, did I know that the Big Shell, a fully functional environmental cleanup facility, was designed to camouflage Arsenal gear?

2676
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:31,200
Yeah, I did.

2677
01:49:31,660 --> 01:49:33,900
It's exactly what the President and Ames described.

2678
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:35,480
A massive cover story.

2679
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:36,780
Oh my gosh, so good.

2680
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:44,500
The good news is that it hasn't really done much in terms of cleaning up the environment, so we won't have to worry about any toxic gas being released if we have to blow the house down.

2681
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:45,040
Okay.

2682
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:45,400
Right.

2683
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:47,520
And when did you find out about all of this?

2684
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:48,260
I don't know.

2685
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:51,980
It took a while, but we uncovered the info around the time you took out that mad bomber.

2686
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:52,840
What a troll.

2687
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:53,800
I know.

2688
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:56,540
There's no doubt that Arsenal gear is being built here.

2689
01:49:56,780 --> 01:49:58,900
And it was all set up two years ago.

2690
01:49:58,980 --> 01:49:59,960
On that day.

2691
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:01,000
All of it.

2692
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:02,780
Two years ago?

2693
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:04,740
What really happened here?

2694
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:05,820
Two years ago?

2695
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:06,800
Hudson River.

2696
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,580
I took these photos two years ago.

2697
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:10,080
Oh my god!

2698
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:10,800
I have these pictures.

2699
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:12,800
They were on the news on several websites.

2700
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:16,340
If I remember right, the reporters blamed you for sinking the tanker.

2701
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:18,240
The news!

2702
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:18,680
That's right.

2703
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:19,480
Otacon.

2704
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:20,120
Me.

2705
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:21,380
We were used.

2706
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:22,280
We were used.

2707
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:24,220
Terrorist action.

2708
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,100
Water though!

2709
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:27,380
At least that was the plan at the time.

2710
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:27,760
Can I go?

2711
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:28,740
I want to see opinions.

2712
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,780
I've gone through VR training of the tanker mission before.

2713
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:32,540
Yeah.

2714
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:35,660
Well, I doubt it accurately simulates the events of that mission.

2715
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:36,360
They took a picture of me.

2716
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:39,320
Serious environmental disaster.

2717
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:44,780
I'd infiltrated the dummy tanker to obtain proof that a metal gear was under development.

2718
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:46,320
I did that.

2719
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:51,400
Shortly after I made it aboard, an armed group of people came to the tanker and said, The armed group led by Colonel Gerlukovich raided the ship and gained control.

2720
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:52,200
Oh my god.

2721
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,340
Olga and Ocelot were among the raiding party.

2722
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:56,100
The world.

2723
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:56,900
Yeah.

2724
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:57,700
And him.

2725
01:50:57,860 --> 01:50:59,080
Who are you talking about?

2726
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:01,020
A man that was supposed to be dead.

2727
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:02,220
Oh.

2728
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:04,020
Their target was also Metal Gear Ray.

2729
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:09,740
But Ocelot eliminated Colonel Gerlukovich and Marine Commander Scott Dolph, and he hijacked Ray.

2730
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:11,760
Oh, Reparoni.

2731
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:13,100
Yeah.

2732
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:14,660
I don't know what kind of deal was going down.

2733
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:17,340
All I remember is what Ocelot said at the time.

2734
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,460
Something like, I'm taking it back.

2735
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:20,080
Ooh.

2736
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:25,740
Ocelot then sank the tanker, along with the soldiers of the Marine Corps.

2737
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:26,820
This is a great summary.

2738
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:31,220
Best character, Dikido.

2739
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:31,260
Dikido.

2740
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:32,260
How did you manage to get out?

2741
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:35,080
Otacon managed to have a small boat ready for me.

2742
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:35,560
Yay, small boat!

2743
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:36,440
That was the easy part.

2744
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:39,740
The tough part was not getting dragged down with a sinking tanker.

2745
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:41,740
Small miracle when you think about it.

2746
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,620
It turned out that the whole thing was a setup to lure us.

2747
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:45,560
Yeah.

2748
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:46,920
Yeah.

2749
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:47,560
Yeah.

2750
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:48,200
Yeah.

2751
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:51,640
The photos of Snake, taken by the Cipher, were released to the public.

2752
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:56,000
In turn, we became the world's most wanted environmental terrorists.

2753
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:56,880
Yeah!

2754
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:01,620
It was definitely a move aimed at putting a stop to our anti-Metal Gear activities.

2755
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:03,880
But why did they choose Snake?

2756
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:05,500
Because he's sexy.

2757
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:08,420
Since the Shadow Moses incident, Snake became sort of a hero.

2758
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:12,120
Oh my God.

2759
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:13,820
Everybody saw him naked?

2760
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:14,680
I think the Patriots weren't too happy about that.

2761
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:16,450
You knew about the Patriots?

2762
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:17,560
When did that happen?

2763
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:18,180
Yeah.

2764
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:19,320
To a certain degree.

2765
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:20,660
Oh, I did all of that.

2766
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:21,760
Actually, this is real footage.

2767
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:22,080
It seems like everyone knows about them except me.

2768
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:23,220
Look how cool I look.

2769
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:24,740
They didn't choose Snake to be a hero.

2770
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:26,040
So they decided to do a senior campaign.

2771
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:26,580
Oh, I did that too.

2772
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:27,140
I did that.

2773
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:27,560
I did that.

2774
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:29,080
This is all real footage that I did.

2775
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:32,900
I think the Patriots wanted to make an example of him, so everybody would think twice before opposing him.

2776
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:34,300
Otakot's family has a history of small boat.

2777
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:34,760
That's it.

2778
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:37,180
They set all this up just to nail you guys.

2779
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,340
No, there's more to it than that.

2780
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:47,380
The Marine's Metal Gear Ray project, headed by Commander Dolph, was carried out in opposition to the Navy's Arsenal Gear project.

2781
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:47,740
You think that was so cool?

2782
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:48,200
Yeah.

2783
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:48,520
I know.

2784
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:56,280
To be more precise, the Patriots considered Metal Gear Ray to be a thorn in their side.

2785
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:59,220
Hence they attacked the dummy tanker and stole Ray.

2786
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:00,240
Stole Ray.

2787
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,100
I remember when you were doing this.

2788
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:04,700
They followed this up with a perfect plan.

2789
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:13,580
They immediately sent a fully loaded tanker to the same location and sank it, then set up the facility to camouflage the development of Arsenal Gear.

2790
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:16,060
And we fell for it.

2791
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:17,680
Two more puppets in their show.

2792
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:20,660
A lot of this stuff is from cut content.

2793
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:29,060
Yeah, I remember he had like a Titanic-esque scene where you had to run out with all the water going.

2794
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:29,840
Shh.

2795
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:35,840
No, he was underground, keeping a low profile at the time.

2796
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,880
Then it must be the Patriots.

2797
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:42,920
If that's the case, what's Ocelot doing alongside Solidus?

2798
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:47,040
Just being a double-crosser, triple-crosser, quadruple-crosser.

2799
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:50,320
Doing what he knows best.

2800
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:51,800
We can figure this out later.

2801
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,980
The nuclear strike's been prevented, but Arsenal still has a massive payload of missiles to deal with.

2802
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:57,440
Right.

2803
01:53:57,620 --> 01:54:00,380
If the opposition gets control of those missiles...

2804
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:02,400
Ryden, you've got to find Emma.

2805
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:03,480
Wait a second.

2806
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:05,040
Isn't Emma Emmerich?

2807
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:06,100
My sister.

2808
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:07,560
What's she doing here?

2809
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:08,500
You got me.

2810
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:16,180
She's a computer whiz who specializes in neural AI and ultra-variable volume data analysis using complex logic.

2811
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:17,160
Neural AI.

2812
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:17,660
Neural AI.

2813
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:19,360
I think her world and weapons development is beyond me.

2814
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:23,640
Whatever her reasons, we need her in order to stop Arsenal.

2815
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:25,460
Ryden, find her.

2816
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:26,620
I'm on my way.

2817
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:26,900
Okay.

2818
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:30,680
Time for Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake Ga Nai.

2819
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:34,300
Neuro-sama.

2820
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:36,360
Neuro-sama.

2821
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:45,100
I love being able to freely wander this area.

2822
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:46,700
I'm treasuring it.

2823
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:48,480
I'm not taking it for granted at all.

2824
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:51,020
Neuro-sama.

2825
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:53,120
Guys,

2826
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:02,940
I will need to go to the little ghosty's room, probably before we go into the next fight.

2827
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:05,340
Wait.

2828
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:08,780
Did I get everything?

2829
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:09,100
Yeah.

2830
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:09,400
Okay.

2831
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:10,900
Coming.

2832
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:14,440
I will need to go to the little...

2833
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:15,080
But

2834
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:22,390
we remember where to go.

2835
01:55:22,610 --> 01:55:24,470
We go to that one room and we go...

2836
01:55:25,630 --> 01:55:26,870
With the handle.

2837
01:55:29,370 --> 01:55:29,810
Good.

2838
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:30,270
No bugs.

2839
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:34,470
I hope the lower level doesn't have any bugs.

2840
01:55:34,870 --> 01:55:36,030
That would be awful.

2841
01:55:36,390 --> 01:55:37,230
You guys...

2842
01:55:37,230 --> 01:55:37,650
Oh my gosh.

2843
01:55:38,450 --> 01:55:40,550
You guys can listen to this ambiance.

2844
01:55:40,910 --> 01:55:42,750
Oh my gosh, it's kind of relaxing here.

2845
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:44,370
This is so nice.

2846
01:55:44,890 --> 01:55:47,690
You can just listen to the water flowing.

2847
01:55:48,810 --> 01:55:50,490
This actually sounds so...

2848
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,020
This is really nice, actually.

2849
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:01,480
It's like the sound of...

2850
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:02,980
The electro...

2851
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:03,500
The electronic...

2852
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,700
Like the whir of the machines and...

2853
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:08,200
I need to pee now.

2854
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:08,580
Okay.

2855
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:09,580
Potty break for everybody.

2856
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:12,680
Potty break for everybody.

2857
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:17,500
Can we listen to Raiden talking to himself?

2858
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:18,140
Wait.

2859
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:18,660
What do you mean?

2860
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:19,940
How could he talk to himself?

2861
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:23,060
I am going to save real quick though.

2862
01:56:23,740 --> 01:56:24,920
See if Rose got anything to say.

2863
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:25,820
What can I do for you, Jack?

2864
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,240
You can give us some...

2865
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:30,240
The sweet, sweet tea, my dear Rose.

2866
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:30,940
Okay.

2867
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:41,300
Jack?

2868
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:42,420
What is it?

2869
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:44,020
I've always been alone.

2870
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:44,960
Huh?

2871
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:46,900
I'm so lonely.

2872
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:48,120
Lonely?

2873
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:50,180
Rose, we've always...

2874
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:50,320
Rose!

2875
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:50,940
Not always.

2876
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:52,400
What do you mean?

2877
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:54,680
You've never slept beside me.

2878
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,320
What are you talking about?

2879
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:57,160
I...

2880
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:59,260
After we've been together in my room...

2881
01:56:59,260 --> 01:56:59,420
Sorry.

2882
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:00,760
You stay awake all night.

2883
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:02,180
Or you head for the door.

2884
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:04,560
Is this really the time to bring this up?

2885
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:05,560
Why, Jack?

2886
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:06,200
Why?

2887
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:07,440
Listen, Rose.

2888
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:09,600
I'm right in the middle of a mission and I...

2889
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:10,180
Why?

2890
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:11,160
Why can't you hear me?

2891
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:13,040
Why can't you relax when you're with me?

2892
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:13,900
Look.

2893
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:15,440
The mission...

2894
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:16,220
I...

2895
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:17,700
Why don't you open up to me?

2896
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:19,000
Rose, I...

2897
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,020
I just can't.

2898
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:22,660
All I ever wanted was to share your dreams.

2899
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:25,300
To spend a meaningful evening with you.

2900
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:26,800
Girl, I'm about to go drowning.

2901
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,720
I just wanted to find you by my side when I woke up.

2902
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:30,180
Is that asking too much?

2903
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:31,820
I just wanted to save the game.

2904
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:32,480
It's the night.

2905
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:33,360
I'm scared of the night.

2906
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:35,500
It's got nothing to do with you.

2907
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:36,200
Scared of the night?

2908
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:37,400
Scared of the night?

2909
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:38,420
Maybe.

2910
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:39,380
What's that supposed to mean?

2911
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:41,140
I can't relax when you're with me.

2912
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,200
Maybe.

2913
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:45,540
Jack, you wouldn't even let me in your room.

2914
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:47,040
I need privacy.

2915
01:57:47,420 --> 01:57:48,820
I just can't be bothered.

2916
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:50,480
Don't go into my room, Rose.

2917
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:51,720
Bothered?

2918
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:56,400
What I wanted to say was that there are certain things that I have to keep to myself.

2919
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:57,080
Oh, my God.

2920
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,940
Do you remember that time I forced my way into your room?

2921
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:00,240
Oh, no.

2922
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:02,240
We'd known each other for almost a year.

2923
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:03,000
No, no.

2924
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:03,820
And you blew up.

2925
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:04,200
Yeah.

2926
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:04,640
You didn't.

2927
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:07,580
It was the first time you ever raised your hand against me.

2928
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:11,120
I was so worried about you.

2929
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:13,560
Look, I'm sorry.

2930
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:16,820
It wasn't you, Violet Nature, that scared me.

2931
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:17,980
It was your room.

2932
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:19,100
It was your room.

2933
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:19,580
Your heart.

2934
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:20,540
Stop it.

2935
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:23,080
There wasn't anything in your room.

2936
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:25,780
Only a bed and a small desk.

2937
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:28,200
It looked like a prison cell.

2938
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:30,760
Rose?

2939
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:32,420
No television set.

2940
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:34,260
No family pictures.

2941
01:58:34,540 --> 01:58:36,080
Not even a poster.

2942
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:39,020
Rose, I only used that room for sleeping.

2943
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:40,680
A lifeless room.

2944
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:41,100
Rose.

2945
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:42,260
I didn't expect to get this.

2946
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:43,820
Almost like your empty heart.

2947
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:44,280
I don't know.

2948
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:46,080
That's why I tried to keep you out.

2949
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:50,660
I thought I was beginning to understand you until I saw that room.

2950
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:51,960
I didn't expect to get this.

2951
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,360
Would you have been happier if I had a picture of you hanging on the wall?

2952
01:58:54,440 --> 01:58:55,040
Oh, my God.

2953
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:56,880
That's not what I was trying to say.

2954
01:58:57,220 --> 01:58:57,900
I don't know.

2955
01:58:57,900 --> 01:58:58,180
Enough, Rose.

2956
01:58:58,360 --> 01:58:59,700
We'll talk about this later.

2957
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,120
After the mission.

2958
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:02,080
Right.

2959
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:03,960
After the mission.

2960
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:04,720
Oh, my God.

2961
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:05,100
I understand.

2962
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:08,080
I didn't expect to get this codec just now.

2963
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:09,440
Oh, my God.

2964
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:10,460
Oh, my God.

2965
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:10,540
Oh, my God.

2966
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:10,600
Oh, my God.

2967
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:10,700
Oh, my God.

2968
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:13,780
I didn't expect to get this.

2969
01:59:13,780 --> 01:59:14,540
Why are they together?

2970
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:21,220
It wasn't you that scared me.

2971
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:22,520
It was your room.

2972
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:24,680
There was nothing in there, bro.

2973
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:27,580
Why are you living in a prison cell?

2974
01:59:30,020 --> 01:59:32,000
It literally said no furniture.

2975
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:37,240
The military dudes spying on them must be frustrated.

2976
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,000
Oh, my gosh.

2977
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,160
Let's see what Snake has to say.

2978
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:42,240
I don't know.

2979
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:43,420
Oh, God.

2980
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:48,720
Hey, come on.

2981
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:50,220
Man, come on.

2982
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:52,720
Okay.

2983
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:56,820
Okay.

2984
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:58,980
Oh, goodness.

2985
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,620
I'm so glad we...

2986
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:09,180
Oh, gosh, I'm so glad we got that codec.

2987
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:09,800
Okay.

2988
02:00:10,460 --> 02:00:12,480
You just hang out with Raiden real quick.

2989
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:13,200
I'm gonna go fishing.

2990
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:16,860
You guys, hang out.

2991
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:17,660
I'll be really fast.

2992
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:18,620
I just gotta pee.

2993
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:22,200
I'm gonna be like that Gerlukovich soldier.

2994
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,740
I'm gonna do it off my balcony.

2995
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:26,240
In honor of him.

2996
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:28,240
I hope nobody's standing below.

2997
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:29,640
You don't understand, Rose.

2998
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,420
There are certain things I have to keep to myself.

2999
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:36,440
Slyly brushes his BL manga into the bed for you.

3000
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,780
Jack and Rose have a relationship as long as...

3001
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:40,820
Loving as it is unhealthy.

3002
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:42,040
So good.

3003
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:43,480
Okay, VRB.

3004
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:46,480
VRB.

3005
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:48,000
VRB.

3006
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:49,320
Gonna go do it off my balcony.

3007
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:35,600
I'm back, but I want more tea, so I'm gonna go get more.

3008
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:38,700
So I'm gonna be just a little second more.

3009
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:44,900
Shout out to everyone playing Blue Archive who decorates their cafe like Raiden.

3010
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:50,900
Oh my god.

3011
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:52,620
Shout out to you, Oimo!

3012
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:53,720
VRB.

3013
02:02:53,860 --> 02:02:54,440
Again.

3014
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:56,160
But I'll be fast.

3015
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:34,560
I hope there were no weird messages.

3016
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:38,020
While I was gone.

3017
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:40,620
I hope there was nothing strange.

3018
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:43,460
Give him a shower.

3019
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:47,340
I did get a snack though.

3020
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:49,000
I got watermelon.

3021
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:49,100
Watermelon!

3022
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:52,100
The perfect summer snack.

3023
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:56,460
Yummy.

3024
02:04:58,700 --> 02:04:59,820
Nothing in my bed.

3025
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:01,060
What would be in your bed?

3026
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:03,620
Oh, definitely not Raiden.

3027
02:05:12,790 --> 02:05:14,170
I love watermelon.

3028
02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:19,110
It was fun meeting you this weekend, Mint.

3029
02:05:19,270 --> 02:05:21,130
Can't wait for the new school show.

3030
02:05:21,370 --> 02:05:22,610
Oh my gosh, yes!

3031
02:05:22,870 --> 02:05:24,010
Have so much fun.

3032
02:05:24,230 --> 02:05:24,890
Have so much fun.

3033
02:05:26,190 --> 02:05:27,450
Do you salt watermelon?

3034
02:05:27,450 --> 02:05:27,810
Sometimes.

3035
02:05:28,230 --> 02:05:30,450
But I'm not really a salty fan.

3036
02:05:35,980 --> 02:05:36,660
Okay.

3037
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:40,180
We ready to go?

3038
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:47,820
Let's go.

3039
02:05:51,940 --> 02:05:54,080
Oh my god, my eyes.

3040
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:58,000
Okay.

3041
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:00,000
Let's go.

3042
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:15,220
I think I can make it this way since we have high health.

3043
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:18,100
We've got high health.

3044
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:19,540
Oh.

3045
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:20,000
Hello?

3046
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:24,080
Raiden, are you reading me?

3047
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:24,920
This is Otacon.

3048
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:26,180
What's your situation?

3049
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:27,860
Wet and miserable.

3050
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:29,660
This place is flooded.

3051
02:06:29,780 --> 02:06:29,980
I was hungry, why aren't you coming?

3052
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,620
What's that?

3053
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:41,600
What?

3054
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:43,480
Yeah.

3055
02:06:43,980 --> 02:06:45,380
Yeah.

3056
02:06:59,980 --> 02:07:00,960
I was in my room.

3057
02:07:01,540 --> 02:07:03,140
I learned later that E.E.

3058
02:07:03,160 --> 02:07:04,280
was calling me for help.

3059
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:06,640
She didn't doubt for a minute that I'd be there.

3060
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:12,920
You could see the pool from my room, but I didn't realize at the time that she needed my help.

3061
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:14,240
What were you doing?

3062
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:14,640
Oof.

3063
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:17,460
Um, um, uh, post-collar.

3064
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:21,220
Yeah, but my father didn't.

3065
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,420
So you blamed yourself and left your family.

3066
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:23,680
Yeah!

3067
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:25,160
Sorry.

3068
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:25,560
E.E.

3069
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:26,980
seems to believe that was the case.

3070
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:29,540
The fact is, I betrayed her.

3071
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:32,880
And you think she can't swim because of the traumatic experience?

3072
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:36,760
I haven't seen her since that day, but yes, I think so.

3073
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:40,560
I got a letter from Julie, her mother, after they moved back to England.

3074
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:42,660
In her letter, she mentioned that E.E.

3075
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:46,140
couldn't swim anymore, that she refused to even wear a bathing suit.

3076
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:46,980
Damn.

3077
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:49,180
If she still can't swim, we're in trouble.

3078
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:52,460
Level B1 in the core is pretty much flooded.

3079
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:53,620
I didn't do it.

3080
02:07:53,720 --> 02:07:55,600
Look, maybe you can help her overcome the trauma.

3081
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:57,880
You want me to help her get over it?

3082
02:07:58,060 --> 02:07:59,960
Well, it's still gonna take some time to repair.

3083
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:01,720
Sorry, kid.

3084
02:08:02,060 --> 02:08:03,440
Emma's rescue is up to you.

3085
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:05,280
Thanks.

3086
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:06,840
An underwater mission.

3087
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:08,340
Well, this is a first.

3088
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,500
Look, I'll see what I can do.

3089
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:16,840
I suggest that you drum the map of the building into your head, cause you won't have time to look at it when you try to bring Emma out.

3090
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:17,200
Yeah.

3091
02:08:17,320 --> 02:08:18,600
I'm counting on you, Raiden.

3092
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:21,900
I covered most of the core when I had to take out the C4s.

3093
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:25,040
If there's anything you need to ask me, call me on the codec.

3094
02:08:25,220 --> 02:08:25,980
I'll do that.

3095
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:27,440
Can I ask you...

3096
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:29,180
Snake?

3097
02:08:29,180 --> 02:08:29,340
Snake?

3098
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:31,460
Why are we here?

3099
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:35,620
Why?

3100
02:08:39,980 --> 02:08:40,420
B1C.

3101
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:43,900
Okay, back.

3102
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:45,080
There we go.

3103
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:46,220
Just to suffer?

3104
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:48,480
Just to suffer.

3105
02:08:50,420 --> 02:08:50,860
Okay.

3106
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:51,780
Alright, Raiden.

3107
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:54,740
Okay, good.

3108
02:08:54,840 --> 02:08:57,340
They didn't have time to reset up the mines.

3109
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:58,020
I think we're...

3110
02:08:58,560 --> 02:08:58,900
Oh, wait.

3111
02:08:58,980 --> 02:08:59,180
Oh.

3112
02:08:59,200 --> 02:08:59,460
Oh.

3113
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:00,220
Hold on.

3114
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:01,720
This way.

3115
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:02,840
I think we're good.

3116
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:04,980
Oh!

3117
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:06,820
Oh my god!

3118
02:09:06,900 --> 02:09:08,840
But they had time to set up rushes!

3119
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:09,640
Let's go.

3120
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:12,640
What is that?

3121
02:09:17,150 --> 02:09:17,630
Wow.

3122
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:20,050
I'm glad the posters are surviving.

3123
02:09:20,490 --> 02:09:21,110
What's that?

3124
02:09:22,610 --> 02:09:23,090
Oh.

3125
02:09:23,110 --> 02:09:23,570
Okay.

3126
02:09:23,790 --> 02:09:23,790
Cool.

3127
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:34,180
Okay.

3128
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:36,920
It's this one.

3129
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:38,500
But what's this one go to anyway?

3130
02:09:40,060 --> 02:09:41,220
Can we even open it?

3131
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:42,360
Oh.

3132
02:09:44,740 --> 02:09:45,940
Oh, it won't even let us.

3133
02:09:46,020 --> 02:09:46,160
Okay.

3134
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:47,660
Here?

3135
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:49,420
Wait.

3136
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:51,720
What button am I supposed to press here?

3137
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:54,340
Oh, there we go.

3138
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:57,720
I was trying the action button but it was being weird.

3139
02:10:01,970 --> 02:10:02,390
Oh!

3140
02:10:05,130 --> 02:10:05,550
Oh!

3141
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:06,670
Oh!

3142
02:10:06,850 --> 02:10:07,510
No surprises!

3143
02:10:07,970 --> 02:10:08,390
Ah!

3144
02:10:09,250 --> 02:10:10,410
No surprises, please!

3145
02:10:11,230 --> 02:10:11,650
Oh!

3146
02:10:11,710 --> 02:10:11,790
Ah!

3147
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:18,960
Still man!

3148
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:24,200
Oh, he's a still man now.

3149
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:25,880
Oh my goodness gracious.

3150
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:28,660
Um, hold on.

3151
02:10:28,980 --> 02:10:30,620
Uh, is he still there?

3152
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:32,180
Oh!

3153
02:10:35,020 --> 02:10:35,740
Uh.

3154
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:36,740
Oh.

3155
02:10:41,370 --> 02:10:42,090
Uh.

3156
02:10:44,510 --> 02:10:46,010
You're my boy.

3157
02:10:47,890 --> 02:10:48,610
Oh.

3158
02:10:49,590 --> 02:10:50,190
Stop asking questions.

3159
02:10:50,190 --> 02:10:50,930
Snake, I found him.

3160
02:10:52,990 --> 02:10:53,690
Hold on.

3161
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:54,330
Oh!

3162
02:11:01,230 --> 02:11:01,830
Oh,

3163
02:11:05,210 --> 02:11:05,610
thank you.

3164
02:11:05,770 --> 02:11:05,950
Oh.

3165
02:11:09,510 --> 02:11:10,110
Oh!

3166
02:11:10,110 --> 02:11:10,390
Oh...

3167
02:11:10,390 --> 02:11:11,030
Oh...

3168
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:13,370
Oh!

3169
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:13,930
Oh.

3170
02:11:16,170 --> 02:11:17,450
Oh My Gosh.

3171
02:11:17,490 --> 02:11:17,710
Oh!

3172
02:11:18,630 --> 02:11:21,790
Then, head north and you should reach filter chamber number two.

3173
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:24,890
Oh, what?

3174
02:11:25,970 --> 02:11:27,010
I know you- wait!

3175
02:11:27,330 --> 02:11:28,510
I found him!

3176
02:11:31,370 --> 02:11:35,410
Emma's probably being- Maybe Colonel?

3177
02:11:36,390 --> 02:11:37,830
Colonel, I found him!

3178
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:46,950
When you're on the surface, you can swim in corresponding direc- I give up.

3179
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:53,920
This poor guy.

3180
02:11:56,480 --> 02:11:59,120
They're like, we don't have time to worry about a dead man.

3181
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:00,620
He's already dead!

3182
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:03,020
Oh gosh, uh, up?

3183
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:08,580
Okay, how do I get through here again?

3184
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:09,080
Over?

3185
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:11,900
And under?

3186
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:15,260
And around?

3187
02:12:15,980 --> 02:12:16,820
Oh, this way?

3188
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:17,200
Right?

3189
02:12:18,340 --> 02:12:18,820
Under?

3190
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:20,060
Under?

3191
02:12:21,220 --> 02:12:22,680
Yeah, and over?

3192
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:25,220
And uh, oh shoot.

3193
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:26,640
Uh, around?

3194
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:27,700
That's a wall?

3195
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:31,260
Oh god, um, I'm gonna end up like Stillman?

3196
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:32,260
Under?

3197
02:12:32,440 --> 02:12:32,720
Under?

3198
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:34,020
Under?

3199
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:34,740
Under?

3200
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:36,660
Oh, what's that?

3201
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:38,400
Grab it!

3202
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:39,040
Riding?

3203
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:39,840
Riding!

3204
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:40,780
Riding, turn around!

3205
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:42,200
Okay, just go up.

3206
02:12:44,080 --> 02:12:44,480
Okay.

3207
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:52,140
Maybe I have to stare at him and then call.

3208
02:12:52,140 --> 02:12:52,760
Or maybe.

3209
02:12:56,360 --> 02:12:58,000
Laugh and grow fat, Stillman.

3210
02:12:58,340 --> 02:12:59,240
Come on, grab it!

3211
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:01,480
There you go, buddy.

3212
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:03,100
Am I going the right way?

3213
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:03,660
Oh gosh.

3214
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:05,500
Up.

3215
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:06,760
Up.

3216
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:07,480
Nope, no.

3217
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:08,600
Go down.

3218
02:13:08,740 --> 02:13:09,420
And here.

3219
02:13:09,620 --> 02:13:10,400
And then go up.

3220
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:10,860
Here.

3221
02:13:11,020 --> 02:13:12,120
Oh, not high enough?

3222
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:13,080
There we go, nice, nice, nice.

3223
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:14,440
Yeah.

3224
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:20,940
Stinger bullets.

3225
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:25,220
You know what I mean!

3226
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:25,500
You know what I mean!

3227
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:26,200
What's here?

3228
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:29,600
Okay.

3229
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:32,500
Cool.

3230
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:34,900
Let's get our breath.

3231
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:38,620
Wow, that's a huge ration.

3232
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:44,640
And let's avoid some... mines, I believe?

3233
02:13:44,980 --> 02:13:45,280
Or?

3234
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:47,040
Oh wait, maybe in the next section?

3235
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:50,700
Okay, I sure hope I'm not ambushed here!

3236
02:13:52,820 --> 02:13:53,680
Soggy ration.

3237
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:56,520
That's how I like them.

3238
02:14:03,910 --> 02:14:06,150
I don't want to see any bisexuals.

3239
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:07,210
I'll cry.

3240
02:14:12,590 --> 02:14:13,270
No!

3241
02:14:16,190 --> 02:14:16,870
No!

3242
02:14:20,770 --> 02:14:21,450
No!

3243
02:14:27,290 --> 02:14:27,970
AHH!

3244
02:14:44,850 --> 02:14:50,730
Also, I love Raiden's response to seeing a man who he literally shot point blank in the head.

3245
02:14:52,010 --> 02:14:52,930
Still alive.

3246
02:14:59,470 --> 02:15:07,010
Oh my gosh, it's really surreal.

3247
02:15:07,830 --> 02:15:09,890
I met like so many of these voice actors.

3248
02:15:09,890 --> 02:15:11,250
Now that I think about it.

3249
02:15:11,330 --> 02:15:12,210
I met Phil Lamarr.

3250
02:15:13,010 --> 02:15:13,910
Like a week ago.

3251
02:15:14,610 --> 02:15:15,370
That's crazy!

3252
02:15:20,230 --> 02:15:20,670
No!

3253
02:15:29,010 --> 02:15:29,730
So cool.

3254
02:15:30,210 --> 02:15:30,570
I know, right?

3255
02:15:31,130 --> 02:15:31,570
Okay.

3256
02:15:33,250 --> 02:15:33,970
What the-

3257
02:15:37,790 --> 02:15:41,110
Are you- Are you calling me a catch?

3258
02:16:02,650 --> 02:16:05,230
Phil Lamarr voices everyone and everything.

3259
02:16:05,430 --> 02:16:06,830
He probably voices me.

3260
02:16:11,130 --> 02:16:12,450
Purified hydrogen bomb?

3261
02:16:12,670 --> 02:16:17,750
Why is it when Snake repeats everything it sounds good, but when Raiden does it, it just makes him sound like an idiot?

3262
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:35,310
The clean thermonuclear bomb is at an experimental stage and is handled differently.

3263
02:16:36,170 --> 02:16:36,730
Clean?

3264
02:16:38,870 --> 02:16:39,430
Specifically.

3265
02:16:39,430 --> 02:16:42,230
You don't want to say spice, like you'll stop looking in the mirror?

3266
02:16:42,350 --> 02:16:42,570
The nuclear threat still exists.

3267
02:16:44,570 --> 02:16:48,830
Six months ago, we lost everything we believed in.

3268
02:16:49,150 --> 02:16:52,290
We were abandoned to take the fall in their cover-up.

3269
02:16:52,450 --> 02:16:58,710
We were labeled as killers, responsible for the mass murder of civilians as well as our own allies.

3270
02:16:59,010 --> 02:17:00,630
I can't tell what's going on in this picture.

3271
02:17:00,890 --> 02:17:05,010
And the public believed every word, turning a deaf ear to whatever we had to say to the contrary.

3272
02:17:05,010 --> 02:17:06,130
Is that Fatman and then Vamp?

3273
02:17:06,130 --> 02:17:09,930
Our only goal is to wipe them from the face of the earth.

3274
02:17:10,210 --> 02:17:14,530
And destroy this world of deceit they have created along with them.

3275
02:17:15,090 --> 02:17:16,190
You're insane.

3276
02:17:17,610 --> 02:17:18,210
Insane?

3277
02:17:18,350 --> 02:17:21,270
We might be the only ones telling the truth.

3278
02:17:22,850 --> 02:17:24,610
Vamp is cradling someone's head.

3279
02:17:24,810 --> 02:17:25,230
Aww.

3280
02:17:29,010 --> 02:17:30,630
It's Raiden's inherent talent.

3281
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:33,110
Kind of like how when you say things, they sound cute.

3282
02:17:33,290 --> 02:17:35,550
Final check for activating arsenal has been completed.

3283
02:17:35,550 --> 02:17:37,810
All arsenal personnel report to your station.

3284
02:17:37,990 --> 02:17:38,630
Who is this guy?

3285
02:17:39,290 --> 02:17:42,450
Well, it sounds like arsenal's ready to go into operation.

3286
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:43,470
Damn it.

3287
02:17:43,590 --> 02:17:44,190
Damn it.

3288
02:17:44,410 --> 02:17:48,150
You're still hoping that the girl can install that virus you're carrying around.

3289
02:17:48,190 --> 02:17:49,170
How do you know that?

3290
02:17:50,770 --> 02:17:51,590
You know?

3291
02:17:54,250 --> 02:17:57,790
It's a shame you're not going to be around long enough to hand her the program.

3292
02:18:00,270 --> 02:18:02,030
That isn't seawater, you know.

3293
02:18:02,190 --> 02:18:04,990
It's a byproduct of the microbes contained in the pool.

3294
02:18:05,550 --> 02:18:09,210
The buoyancy is practically non-existent thanks to the high oxygen content.

3295
02:18:09,250 --> 02:18:12,010
I've heard about that kind of water literally recently.

3296
02:18:12,530 --> 02:18:14,410
Take a good look at your grave.

3297
02:18:16,390 --> 02:18:18,690
Like I saw kind of a video about it.

3298
02:18:19,070 --> 02:18:19,570
Ta-da!

3299
02:18:19,770 --> 02:18:20,590
Oh my god!

3300
02:18:20,610 --> 02:18:20,830
No!

3301
02:18:20,970 --> 02:18:21,950
We have to fight Vamp!

3302
02:18:22,210 --> 02:18:22,650
Okay.

3303
02:18:22,710 --> 02:18:23,710
Let's kick his butt.

3304
02:18:25,650 --> 02:18:26,310
Oh gosh.

3305
02:18:26,470 --> 02:18:26,710
Okay.

3306
02:18:31,710 --> 02:18:33,590
I don't remember how to do this fight.

3307
02:18:45,620 --> 02:18:46,820
Can I take him out here?

3308
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:47,460
Or does he...

3309
02:18:47,460 --> 02:18:48,000
Oh gosh.

3310
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:52,900
There he goes.

3311
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:09,040
Okay.

3312
02:19:09,380 --> 02:19:09,740
Alright.

3313
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:11,100
I'm just going to take care of these real quick.

3314
02:19:12,620 --> 02:19:12,980
Okay.

3315
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:15,460
Nice.

3316
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:15,760
Nice.

3317
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:15,940
Nice.

3318
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:17,400
Okay.

3319
02:19:22,980 --> 02:19:23,680
There he is.

3320
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:25,960
Can't you like shoot him in here?

3321
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:26,420
Oh god.

3322
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:27,160
Where is he?

3323
02:19:27,460 --> 02:19:27,660
Oh.

3324
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:28,140
Oh.

3325
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:42,300
Can't do it while...

3326
02:19:42,300 --> 02:19:43,180
I can't do it.

3327
02:19:43,900 --> 02:19:45,260
Not while he's being a ballerina.

3328
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:47,320
Woo!

3329
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:49,900
Yes Vamp!

3330
02:19:51,100 --> 02:19:51,540
Yes!

3331
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:53,360
Wait!

3332
02:19:55,620 --> 02:19:56,500
Can I...?

3333
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:58,120
Jerk.

3334
02:19:59,120 --> 02:19:59,560
I

3335
02:20:18,310 --> 02:20:19,330
don't remember how to do this fight.

3336
02:20:19,370 --> 02:20:19,730
Sorry guys.

3337
02:20:20,030 --> 02:20:21,010
If you're just like...

3338
02:20:21,010 --> 02:20:21,630
Hey do this.

3339
02:20:22,990 --> 02:20:23,550
Oh yeah!

3340
02:20:23,590 --> 02:20:25,150
Stinger in the water does work too.

3341
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:25,630
That's right!

3342
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:27,170
That's like how you cheese it, isn't it?

3343
02:20:31,130 --> 02:20:31,830
Doesn't it work?

3344
02:20:32,870 --> 02:20:33,930
Stinger in the water.

3345
02:20:33,930 --> 02:20:33,990
Oh god!

3346
02:20:33,990 --> 02:20:34,830
Where is he?

3347
02:20:35,790 --> 02:20:36,390
Hey buddy!

3348
02:20:37,530 --> 02:20:38,190
Where you at?

3349
02:20:47,930 --> 02:20:48,770
Is it a cheese?

3350
02:20:48,990 --> 02:20:50,490
I think it's technically like that.

3351
02:20:50,690 --> 02:20:55,710
Well, I mean, I say technically as if like there's a right way and a wrong way.

3352
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:01,850
Stop being so fancy with me!

3353
02:21:03,030 --> 02:21:05,910
Sorry I'm not using the tranq.

3354
02:21:06,090 --> 02:21:08,550
I just really, you know what, I don't want to use it on him.

3355
02:21:13,850 --> 02:21:15,210
Oh, he's over there.

3356
02:21:17,270 --> 02:21:20,850
I know if I bait him... and then... Oh!

3357
02:21:21,210 --> 02:21:21,770
No!

3358
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:24,790
I missed my chance!

3359
02:21:28,110 --> 02:21:30,830
He's like good for like two seconds.

3360
02:21:31,030 --> 02:21:31,630
Oh my gosh!

3361
02:21:44,040 --> 02:21:45,280
He scared me.

3362
02:21:52,470 --> 02:21:54,290
Okay, so after he throws...

3363
02:21:59,070 --> 02:22:00,050
Oh, he's...

3364
02:22:01,870 --> 02:22:02,930
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

3365
02:22:02,930 --> 02:22:03,650
Right now, right now!

3366
02:22:04,630 --> 02:22:05,470
Ah, shoot!

3367
02:22:07,250 --> 02:22:09,710
Okay, I'm remembering a little bit.

3368
02:22:10,590 --> 02:22:12,070
Might just be slow, you know.

3369
02:22:12,850 --> 02:22:13,850
Oh, not Nikita.

3370
02:22:14,010 --> 02:22:14,390
Just kidding.

3371
02:22:16,950 --> 02:22:18,030
Where you at?

3372
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:24,250
It's like so... such a little amount of...

3373
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:33,880
Whatever works.

3374
02:22:35,560 --> 02:22:37,100
Whatever works, you know?

3375
02:22:55,900 --> 02:22:56,800
Oh my gosh.

3376
02:23:01,540 --> 02:23:02,380
Are you stupid?

3377
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:05,440
You didn't even hit me once!

3378
02:23:05,640 --> 02:23:07,940
You aimed at the entirely wrong direction!

3379
02:23:10,980 --> 02:23:13,060
I should have gotten a better shot though.

3380
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:14,000
That's my bad.

3381
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:18,000
Oh, it takes out like his stamina.

3382
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:20,140
Maybe it's not good to do it then.

3383
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:21,600
We'll just wait until he comes back up.

3384
02:23:22,940 --> 02:23:27,060
He just wants to show off.

3385
02:23:28,220 --> 02:23:28,620
Yeah.

3386
02:23:30,040 --> 02:23:31,620
I kind of want to swim in there though.

3387
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:40,840
That was too slow.

3388
02:23:41,900 --> 02:23:42,920
That was too slow.

3389
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:47,020
Maybe... I think actually I can...

3390
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:50,060
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

3391
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:50,860
I can punch him.

3392
02:24:14,110 --> 02:24:14,990
Just a little bit.

3393
02:24:15,650 --> 02:24:16,650
Every little bit helps.

3394
02:24:17,930 --> 02:24:20,450
I go and struggle with everybody's sexual skills.

3395
02:24:20,890 --> 02:24:21,990
What do you mean by that?

3396
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:37,040
Gosh, I'm so slow with aiming.

3397
02:24:42,210 --> 02:24:45,510
Oh, maybe I should just go for his... You know what?

3398
02:24:45,530 --> 02:24:46,030
One or the other.

3399
02:24:46,090 --> 02:24:46,230
Whatever.

3400
02:24:47,210 --> 02:24:49,170
Maybe I should just go for his stamina then, you know?

3401
02:25:18,260 --> 02:25:20,020
Never realized the melee works on him.

3402
02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:21,380
Oh shoot, I forgot that...

3403
02:25:21,380 --> 02:25:21,540
Ow!

3404
02:25:24,780 --> 02:25:30,330
That was the first hit on me.

3405
02:25:30,430 --> 02:25:31,110
Hey, come here.

3406
02:25:31,930 --> 02:25:34,090
Oh my god, he's getting really aggressive with me!

3407
02:25:35,050 --> 02:25:36,450
Yo, get off right then!

3408
02:25:39,470 --> 02:25:40,110
Oh my gosh.

3409
02:25:43,780 --> 02:25:44,580
Phase 2?

3410
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:46,200
Phase 2, I think?

3411
02:25:49,820 --> 02:25:50,860
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3412
02:25:52,860 --> 02:25:53,560
Oh my god.

3413
02:25:54,980 --> 02:25:56,240
Suddenly I started sucking.

3414
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:01,160
I

3415
02:26:07,810 --> 02:26:08,990
don't think I got him though.

3416
02:26:09,070 --> 02:26:09,390
What the?

3417
02:26:09,630 --> 02:26:10,630
Oh my gosh!

3418
02:26:11,050 --> 02:26:12,130
You sucker!

3419
02:26:16,030 --> 02:26:20,470
Why are you able to get me so well?

3420
02:26:26,370 --> 02:26:27,110
Oh my god.

3421
02:26:27,230 --> 02:26:28,250
Oh my god.

3422
02:26:28,550 --> 02:26:29,070
What

3423
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:37,300
the?

3424
02:26:38,260 --> 02:26:39,240
Oh my god.

3425
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:46,460
Don't choke.

3426
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:47,380
I'm trying.

3427
02:26:47,740 --> 02:26:48,540
I'm trying.

3428
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:56,280
He stopped being able to attack my...

3429
02:27:03,890 --> 02:27:05,330
How do I shoot him now?

3430
02:27:06,090 --> 02:27:06,570
Wait.

3431
02:27:07,330 --> 02:27:08,590
How do I shoot him now?

3432
02:27:08,970 --> 02:27:09,190
Oh.

3433
02:27:17,630 --> 02:27:18,110
You

3434
02:27:24,470 --> 02:27:25,690
can use the big guns?

3435
02:27:26,190 --> 02:27:26,850
Stinger him?

3436
02:27:27,110 --> 02:27:27,370
Okay.

3437
02:27:28,030 --> 02:27:30,470
Yeah, let's just go back to that strat, right?

3438
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:49,540
That was so close.

3439
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:51,000
Holy cow.

3440
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:53,860
That was close.

3441
02:27:55,580 --> 02:27:57,500
Yeah, try and get me as I run away!

3442
02:27:57,740 --> 02:27:59,300
I'm a coward, I'm a coward, I'm a coward!

3443
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:15,500
I like how he falls back into the water.

3444
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:20,480
Tactical retreat, so true.

3445
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:32,320
That's right, yeah.

3446
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:04,560
Actually, I don't care if you're okay.

3447
02:29:06,060 --> 02:29:08,680
I can't wait for your very timely death.

3448
02:29:15,580 --> 02:29:17,420
Back into the sea with Yi!

3449
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:20,980
He avoided it.

3450
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:25,500
Oh my god.

3451
02:29:27,140 --> 02:29:28,120
He's so fast!

3452
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:32,980
Go back into the sea!

3453
02:29:36,390 --> 02:29:36,990
Stop!

3454
02:29:37,570 --> 02:29:38,170
Stop!

3455
02:29:38,330 --> 02:29:38,930
Stop!

3456
02:29:39,050 --> 02:29:39,770
You're so fast!

3457
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:44,380
You're being too fast!

3458
02:29:44,700 --> 02:29:45,180
Oh my gosh.

3459
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:47,200
You're being too ridiculous right now, VAMP.

3460
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:48,120
Oh my gosh.

3461
02:29:48,180 --> 02:29:49,960
You're being ridiculous right now, VAMP.

3462
02:29:51,460 --> 02:29:55,560
Ain't you not gonna go back into the sea?

3463
02:29:58,240 --> 02:29:59,200
Phase three.

3464
02:30:01,480 --> 02:30:01,960
Shoot!

3465
02:30:02,420 --> 02:30:06,280
I know he's...

3466
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:10,740
You can get him after he has launched the three.

3467
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:12,780
It's just hard to tell.

3468
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,480
When he's gonna do it.

3469
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:17,960
Sometimes he jumps around.

3470
02:30:19,400 --> 02:30:19,920
Sometimes...

3471
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:20,140
Okay.

3472
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:21,280
Let's see.

3473
02:30:22,820 --> 02:30:24,320
He's got the zoomies.

3474
02:30:33,660 --> 02:30:34,680
Which one would be better?

3475
02:30:34,880 --> 02:30:36,080
I have more bullets for the M4.

3476
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:38,920
How...

3477
02:30:39,480 --> 02:30:40,580
Guys, I have a question.

3478
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:43,260
How do I...

3479
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:44,900
Auto-aim.

3480
02:30:45,140 --> 02:30:46,440
How do I turn it on?

3481
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:46,580
Oh my god.

3482
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:50,120
How do I...

3483
02:30:50,120 --> 02:30:51,300
Turn on.

3484
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:53,480
Auto-aim.

3485
02:30:58,600 --> 02:30:59,800
Oh shoot.

3486
02:31:05,870 --> 02:31:06,150
Okay.

3487
02:31:17,220 --> 02:31:18,000
Okay, okay.

3488
02:31:18,400 --> 02:31:19,640
I'm too slow though.

3489
02:31:19,780 --> 02:31:20,040
Okay.

3490
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:22,680
Oh

3491
02:31:28,750 --> 02:31:29,150
my gosh.

3492
02:31:30,150 --> 02:31:31,050
I'm so bad.

3493
02:31:33,070 --> 02:31:33,670
Yeah.

3494
02:31:36,530 --> 02:31:37,650
Throw your thingies.

3495
02:31:39,090 --> 02:31:39,990
Oh my god.

3496
02:31:40,010 --> 02:31:41,090
It's a freaking wall.

3497
02:31:44,530 --> 02:31:45,510
Oh my god.

3498
02:31:46,090 --> 02:31:46,850
Throw them.

3499
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:52,700
Oh my god.

3500
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:54,080
Vamp.

3501
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:56,940
Take any damage please.

3502
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:05,900
Where is he?

3503
02:32:11,060 --> 02:32:12,900
This is getting stupid, vamp.

3504
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:13,780
This is getting stupid.

3505
02:32:14,580 --> 02:32:15,220
This is...

3506
02:32:15,220 --> 02:32:19,640
Look at... look at... everything is littered with your... with your... little... things.

3507
02:32:20,400 --> 02:32:21,260
Oh my god.

3508
02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:24,580
That

3509
02:32:31,800 --> 02:32:33,520
was pretty funny, I'm not gonna lie.

3510
02:32:36,210 --> 02:32:36,970
It's okay.

3511
02:32:38,170 --> 02:32:38,770
Combine.

3512
02:32:57,160 --> 02:32:57,760
How?

3513
02:32:58,440 --> 02:32:59,540
How do I?

3514
02:33:01,020 --> 02:33:01,620
Yeah.

3515
02:33:06,930 --> 02:33:08,130
He spins.

3516
02:33:08,430 --> 02:33:09,230
He does his little...

3517
02:33:10,110 --> 02:33:10,630
Oh my god.

3518
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:16,970
Bleeding out again.

3519
02:33:17,830 --> 02:33:19,490
Maybe I need to hit him and then shoot?

3520
02:33:24,380 --> 02:33:25,560
Can't remember this...

3521
02:33:25,560 --> 02:33:27,640
freaking part at all.

3522
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:28,320
Ouch!

3523
02:33:28,380 --> 02:33:28,900
Ouch!

3524
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:49,290
Okay, let's see what else I got.

3525
02:33:49,430 --> 02:33:50,010
This is stupid.

3526
02:33:55,630 --> 02:33:58,510
Will he... be able to... dodge this?

3527
02:34:06,150 --> 02:34:07,170
Please ma'am.

3528
02:34:07,630 --> 02:34:08,110
Please.

3529
02:34:08,870 --> 02:34:09,350
Why?

3530
02:34:10,290 --> 02:34:10,510
Why?

3531
02:34:10,630 --> 02:34:11,410
I tried shooting!

3532
02:34:13,130 --> 02:34:13,610
Is it...

3533
02:34:17,270 --> 02:34:19,190
Can I shoot in first person in this?

3534
02:34:19,250 --> 02:34:19,690
I have no idea.

3535
02:34:22,010 --> 02:34:23,310
I'm not auto-aiming!

3536
02:34:24,850 --> 02:34:26,070
I'm not auto-aiming.

3537
02:34:26,470 --> 02:34:29,150
If you are just like, you can't auto-aim, I'm not doing it.

3538
02:34:31,250 --> 02:34:32,030
Oh my god.

3539
02:34:32,110 --> 02:34:32,890
Just come down here!

3540
02:34:33,070 --> 02:34:33,370
You...

3541
02:34:33,370 --> 02:34:34,290
You piece!

3542
02:34:35,810 --> 02:34:36,090
Please.

3543
02:34:36,890 --> 02:34:37,490
Please!

3544
02:34:42,070 --> 02:34:42,670
Ooooh!

3545
02:34:46,620 --> 02:34:47,220
Finally.

3546
02:34:59,240 --> 02:35:02,040
I never want to see your stupid face again, Bap.

3547
02:35:07,300 --> 02:35:08,680
Drown in that water.

3548
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:10,820
Drown, drown, drown in it.

3549
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:20,760
God.

3550
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:21,860
So dramatic.

3551
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:27,240
Sorry.

3552
02:35:27,240 --> 02:35:29,000
Sorry that last part was so annoying.

3553
02:35:32,860 --> 02:35:34,280
You're not in it!

3554
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:47,440
You killed him but now he's dead.

3555
02:35:47,660 --> 02:35:48,180
Yippee!

3556
02:35:50,780 --> 02:35:54,000
Literally like two thirds of that fight was me running around in a circle.

3557
02:36:00,680 --> 02:36:03,280
Next is the easy part of the game.

3558
02:36:12,480 --> 02:36:14,240
Then you should see her, right?

3559
02:36:14,380 --> 02:36:16,180
I don't have the right to see her.

3560
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:17,780
We can talk about this later.

3561
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:19,980
Raiden, I think you'd better get moving.

3562
02:36:20,260 --> 02:36:22,200
Emma's in the locker room to the north, right?

3563
02:36:22,420 --> 02:36:23,180
I'm on it.

3564
02:36:29,420 --> 02:36:29,900
Okay.

3565
02:36:31,220 --> 02:36:32,000
I'm Otacon.

3566
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:34,080
Yay!

3567
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:37,720
We lost a couple rations though.

3568
02:36:39,480 --> 02:36:40,860
But, you know.

3569
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:42,620
We'll get him.

3570
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:44,440
We'll get him back!

3571
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:46,460
Thanks again.

3572
02:36:51,300 --> 02:36:52,340
Okay, watch out.

3573
02:36:52,660 --> 02:36:53,500
Watch out!

3574
02:36:53,560 --> 02:36:54,080
Watch out!

3575
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:54,420
Watch out!

3576
02:36:54,420 --> 02:36:54,740
Watch out!

3577
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:55,140
Watch out!

3578
02:36:55,140 --> 02:36:55,880
Watch out!

3579
02:36:56,480 --> 02:36:57,200
Watch out!

3580
02:36:57,300 --> 02:36:58,020
Watch out!

3581
02:36:58,040 --> 02:36:58,660
Watch out!

3582
02:36:58,740 --> 02:36:59,340
Watch out!

3583
02:36:59,420 --> 02:36:59,820
Watch out!

3584
02:36:59,820 --> 02:36:59,980
Watch out!

3585
02:37:00,140 --> 02:37:00,140
Watch out!

3586
02:37:00,140 --> 02:37:00,720
Go down.

3587
02:37:00,980 --> 02:37:01,520
Go down?

3588
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:02,280
Go up?

3589
02:37:02,440 --> 02:37:03,100
Go up.

3590
02:37:03,180 --> 02:37:03,660
Go down?

3591
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:04,380
Where do I go?

3592
02:37:04,520 --> 02:37:05,000
Go up.

3593
02:37:06,020 --> 02:37:06,500
Go...

3594
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:07,760
Somewhere?

3595
02:37:07,980 --> 02:37:09,540
Oh my gosh, I'm in the wrong room!

3596
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:12,040
Raiden...

3597
02:37:12,680 --> 02:37:13,160
Raiden...

3598
02:37:13,160 --> 02:37:14,220
I didn't...

3599
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:18,100
It just threw me into that room.

3600
02:37:21,940 --> 02:37:24,540
Oh, Raiden, why are you so thick, man?

3601
02:37:27,580 --> 02:37:29,220
Wait, this is the same room!

3602
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:30,620
Raiden, go this way!

3603
02:37:38,850 --> 02:37:39,830
Oh my god.

3604
02:37:41,550 --> 02:37:43,170
He's so thick.

3605
02:37:46,150 --> 02:37:46,710
Down.

3606
02:37:46,930 --> 02:37:47,450
Down.

3607
02:37:51,810 --> 02:37:52,170
Down.

3608
02:37:53,270 --> 02:37:54,070
Body armor!

3609
02:37:55,330 --> 02:37:55,730
Yeah!

3610
02:37:55,990 --> 02:37:56,830
Body armor!

3611
02:37:57,510 --> 02:37:58,850
Oh, we're gonna need that later.

3612
02:37:59,050 --> 02:37:59,630
For sure.

3613
02:38:00,230 --> 02:38:01,310
We're gonna need that.

3614
02:38:02,530 --> 02:38:03,230
Oh my god.

3615
02:38:03,310 --> 02:38:03,790
Oh my god.

3616
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:04,270
Oh my god.

3617
02:38:04,310 --> 02:38:04,870
Oh my god.

3618
02:38:05,130 --> 02:38:06,470
Oh, turn around, Raiden!

3619
02:38:06,690 --> 02:38:07,670
It's not worth it!

3620
02:38:07,910 --> 02:38:08,410
Oh gosh.

3621
02:38:08,510 --> 02:38:08,770
Go up.

3622
02:38:08,870 --> 02:38:08,970
Go up.

3623
02:38:15,230 --> 02:38:16,950
Is there anything in that room?

3624
02:38:17,070 --> 02:38:17,610
I can't remember.

3625
02:38:18,570 --> 02:38:18,970
Down.

3626
02:38:19,150 --> 02:38:19,550
Down.

3627
02:38:19,770 --> 02:38:20,010
Down.

3628
02:38:21,330 --> 02:38:22,030
Oh, wait.

3629
02:38:22,130 --> 02:38:22,150
Oh.

3630
02:38:23,770 --> 02:38:24,770
I wasn't...

3631
02:38:24,770 --> 02:38:27,170
You guys, I swear, I swear to you.

3632
02:38:27,270 --> 02:38:28,490
I was not...

3633
02:38:28,490 --> 02:38:29,190
I was...

3634
02:38:29,190 --> 02:38:30,570
I didn't even press circle.

3635
02:38:30,630 --> 02:38:31,590
I swear to you.

3636
02:38:31,770 --> 02:38:33,010
I swear to you!

3637
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:55,480
Raiden's bleeding out.

3638
02:38:56,100 --> 02:38:57,340
I got a bandage.

3639
02:38:58,240 --> 02:38:59,500
Where is my bandage?

3640
02:38:59,800 --> 02:39:00,300
Bandage.

3641
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:02,060
Boop.

3642
02:39:06,030 --> 02:39:06,790
I'm lost.

3643
02:39:06,830 --> 02:39:06,890
I'm lost.

3644
02:39:07,350 --> 02:39:09,610
I think I do have to go into that really cursed room.

3645
02:39:10,770 --> 02:39:11,130
Wait.

3646
02:39:11,490 --> 02:39:13,070
Did I go all the way back to the beginning?

3647
02:39:13,270 --> 02:39:13,870
Where am I?

3648
02:39:16,810 --> 02:39:17,990
Stick drip the ping!

3649
02:39:18,430 --> 02:39:19,690
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

3650
02:39:22,050 --> 02:39:23,410
Oh no, wait, it's this one.

3651
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:24,130
Right here, right?

3652
02:39:30,020 --> 02:39:32,020
Oh wait, this is... no, yeah, it's this one.

3653
02:39:33,340 --> 02:39:33,880
Cool, right?

3654
02:39:48,910 --> 02:39:49,510
Okay.

3655
02:39:50,770 --> 02:39:54,970
Wish I had a node right now, node right now, node right now.

3656
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:00,220
Oh, possess a meme.

3657
02:40:03,560 --> 02:40:04,160
Book!

3658
02:40:15,730 --> 02:40:16,330
C4.

3659
02:40:39,290 --> 02:40:40,450
Get bullied, nerd.

3660
02:40:42,550 --> 02:40:44,550
I wonder how much she's like her brother.

3661
02:40:47,330 --> 02:40:49,430
We all know they have one thing in common.

3662
02:40:56,140 --> 02:40:57,620
Here's the one thing in common.

3663
02:41:09,090 --> 02:41:10,190
Are you alright?

3664
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:15,480
There it is.

3665
02:41:15,500 --> 02:41:15,760
Who are you?

3666
02:41:17,400 --> 02:41:19,100
Raiden, I'm getting you out of here.

3667
02:41:20,180 --> 02:41:21,020
Get me out?

3668
02:41:21,620 --> 02:41:22,300
You're lying.

3669
02:41:22,840 --> 02:41:24,320
Where are you taking me this time?

3670
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:24,540
What are you talking about?

3671
02:41:24,540 --> 02:41:25,560
The best escort mission I've ever seen.

3672
02:41:25,580 --> 02:41:26,060
Of all time.

3673
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:27,060
I'm here to help.

3674
02:41:30,280 --> 02:41:31,660
This is my redemption arc.

3675
02:41:32,460 --> 02:41:33,780
Here, I'll prove it.

3676
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:34,760
This is my redemption.

3677
02:41:34,780 --> 02:41:35,560
Do you have nanos?

3678
02:41:35,560 --> 02:41:36,940
This is my redemption arc.

3679
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:37,720
Well, do you?

3680
02:41:37,820 --> 02:41:38,460
I do.

3681
02:41:38,720 --> 02:41:39,620
This is my redemption arc.

3682
02:41:39,640 --> 02:41:40,120
This is my redemption arc.

3683
02:41:40,120 --> 02:41:41,620
Everybody on this project has them.

3684
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:43,680
Okay, good.

3685
02:41:43,820 --> 02:41:44,460
Let's try.

3686
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:47,760
Beep, beep.

3687
02:41:52,750 --> 02:41:53,830
Can you hear me now?

3688
02:41:54,550 --> 02:41:54,990
Nanocommunication?

3689
02:41:55,250 --> 02:41:55,790
That's right.

3690
02:41:55,950 --> 02:41:57,350
I have nanomachines too.

3691
02:41:57,470 --> 02:41:58,210
Her little hairs are so cute.

3692
02:41:58,210 --> 02:41:59,010
Not one of them.

3693
02:41:59,210 --> 02:42:00,750
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

3694
02:42:00,810 --> 02:42:01,590
The little one sticking up there is so cute.

3695
02:42:01,590 --> 02:42:02,910
And you came to rescue me?

3696
02:42:03,510 --> 02:42:05,370
Actually, I need your help to stop Arsenal.

3697
02:42:05,670 --> 02:42:08,450
I understand you're the only one who might be able to do it.

3698
02:42:08,670 --> 02:42:09,870
And who told you that?

3699
02:42:10,230 --> 02:42:10,870
The President.

3700
02:42:11,230 --> 02:42:11,630
Really?

3701
02:42:11,730 --> 02:42:12,070
The President.

3702
02:42:12,070 --> 02:42:13,750
I need you to come with me to Shell One.

3703
02:42:13,950 --> 02:42:15,550
Your brother's waiting for you there.

3704
02:42:15,850 --> 02:42:16,530
My brother?

3705
02:42:18,630 --> 02:42:19,270
Uh-oh.

3706
02:42:20,370 --> 02:42:20,970
Come on.

3707
02:42:20,990 --> 02:42:22,190
We have to get moving.

3708
02:42:22,410 --> 02:42:22,730
I can't.

3709
02:42:22,730 --> 02:42:23,870
This place will be flooded soon.

3710
02:42:25,550 --> 02:42:26,370
Come on.

3711
02:42:26,530 --> 02:42:31,310
Oh my god.

3712
02:42:31,390 --> 02:42:32,170
Take his hand.

3713
02:42:32,530 --> 02:42:34,070
Take the pretty boy's hand.

3714
02:42:34,450 --> 02:42:36,530
Oh my god.

3715
02:42:36,570 --> 02:42:37,210
She's just like...

3716
02:42:37,210 --> 02:42:38,630
This is just like my Japanese anime.

3717
02:42:39,070 --> 02:42:40,850
This is just like my Otome games.

3718
02:42:41,310 --> 02:42:42,230
Oh my gosh.

3719
02:42:44,230 --> 02:42:45,310
Be shonen.

3720
02:42:48,530 --> 02:42:49,070
What?

3721
02:42:49,550 --> 02:42:50,550
Why'd you...

3722
02:42:51,510 --> 02:42:52,490
Better move.

3723
02:42:52,490 --> 02:42:53,190
Yeah.

3724
02:42:54,930 --> 02:42:55,990
I can't swim.

3725
02:43:01,340 --> 02:43:03,120
At least she'll get to wash her pants.

3726
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:03,260
Leave me.

3727
02:43:03,260 --> 02:43:03,780
You can swim.

3728
02:43:03,940 --> 02:43:05,320
You used to love it.

3729
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:06,460
How do you know?

3730
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:07,900
Your brother told me.

3731
02:43:08,220 --> 02:43:09,300
He's really here?

3732
02:43:09,620 --> 02:43:10,020
Yeah.

3733
02:43:10,040 --> 02:43:10,260
That's right.

3734
02:43:10,320 --> 02:43:11,680
He's here to rescue you.

3735
02:43:11,860 --> 02:43:12,780
I don't believe you.

3736
02:43:12,900 --> 02:43:14,380
He would never come for me.

3737
02:43:14,620 --> 02:43:16,060
And I'm telling you he's here.

3738
02:43:16,220 --> 02:43:17,900
Waiting for us at Shell One.

3739
02:43:18,300 --> 02:43:18,800
No.

3740
02:43:19,220 --> 02:43:20,300
He left me.

3741
02:43:20,420 --> 02:43:21,400
My mother.

3742
02:43:21,700 --> 02:43:23,340
When we needed him the most.

3743
02:43:23,500 --> 02:43:24,700
When my father died.

3744
02:43:24,700 --> 02:43:26,260
All he could think about was himself.

3745
02:43:26,640 --> 02:43:26,920
Emma.

3746
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:28,620
We can go over all that later.

3747
02:43:28,800 --> 02:43:30,820
But first we have to get out of here.

3748
02:43:31,100 --> 02:43:31,420
No.

3749
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:32,620
I hate water.

3750
02:43:32,880 --> 02:43:33,680
It's hopeless.

3751
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:35,140
I can't swim.

3752
02:43:35,320 --> 02:43:35,820
I hate water.

3753
02:43:35,860 --> 02:43:36,700
It's wet.

3754
02:43:36,840 --> 02:43:37,400
It's coarse.

3755
02:43:38,220 --> 02:43:39,220
Gets in my pants.

3756
02:43:39,240 --> 02:43:39,900
I can't swim.

3757
02:43:40,280 --> 02:43:41,220
You can do it.

3758
02:43:41,420 --> 02:43:42,640
I can't.

3759
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:43,040
Oh my god.

3760
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:43,480
Come on.

3761
02:43:43,500 --> 02:43:45,680
Deep down inside you know you can swim.

3762
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:47,880
I can't keep my eyes open in the water.

3763
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:49,300
Endless blue.

3764
02:43:50,440 --> 02:43:51,100
The water.

3765
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:51,760
Endless blue.

3766
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:52,440
It wants me.

3767
02:43:52,540 --> 02:43:53,340
It won't let me go.

3768
02:43:53,740 --> 02:43:54,440
All right.

3769
02:43:54,480 --> 02:43:54,680
Let's go.

3770
02:43:54,680 --> 02:43:55,820
Then close your eyes.

3771
02:43:56,040 --> 02:43:57,000
I'll guide you.

3772
02:43:57,400 --> 02:43:59,560
I was injected with something.

3773
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:00,940
My legs.

3774
02:44:01,140 --> 02:44:02,880
I have trouble moving them.

3775
02:44:03,400 --> 02:44:04,040
Listen Emma.

3776
02:44:04,160 --> 02:44:05,180
Just hold your breath.

3777
02:44:05,320 --> 02:44:05,880
I'll be the rest.

3778
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:06,340
She has so many excuses.

3779
02:44:06,580 --> 02:44:08,320
I could never tell if that was actually true.

3780
02:44:08,700 --> 02:44:14,160
I mean the way she walks like it does seem like she had something injected but like she just seems so...

3781
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:14,600
First we'll have to build your chamber too.

3782
02:44:14,780 --> 02:44:15,840
Then we'll take a break.

3783
02:44:15,880 --> 02:44:16,140
You know.

3784
02:44:16,140 --> 02:44:17,840
She just seems like she has all sorts of excuses.

3785
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:18,580
All I have to do is hold my breath.

3786
02:44:18,820 --> 02:44:19,420
That's right.

3787
02:44:19,720 --> 02:44:20,160
Yeah.

3788
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:21,600
How long?

3789
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:23,520
Just a little while.

3790
02:44:23,980 --> 02:44:24,660
Are you sure?

3791
02:44:24,680 --> 02:44:26,140
Of course I'm sure.

3792
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:27,220
That's how I got here.

3793
02:44:28,540 --> 02:44:29,800
I don't think I can do it.

3794
02:44:29,940 --> 02:44:31,420
I'm not good at holding my breath.

3795
02:44:31,740 --> 02:44:32,220
Look Emma.

3796
02:44:32,380 --> 02:44:33,220
I have an idea.

3797
02:44:33,620 --> 02:44:35,500
I'm not good at holding my breath.

3798
02:44:37,160 --> 02:44:40,020
Put your ear against my chest and listen to my heartbeat.

3799
02:44:40,400 --> 02:44:41,180
Your heartbeat?

3800
02:44:41,660 --> 02:44:42,500
Count the beats.

3801
02:44:42,820 --> 02:44:44,320
Don't think about anything else.

3802
02:44:44,440 --> 02:44:46,620
When you reach 100 open your eyes.

3803
02:44:46,620 --> 02:44:47,020
You know it's so...

3804
02:44:47,020 --> 02:44:49,080
By that time we'll be on the other side.

3805
02:44:49,460 --> 02:44:49,860
What?

3806
02:44:49,860 --> 02:44:51,620
Give me a signal if you think you're running out of breath.

3807
02:44:51,900 --> 02:44:52,900
What will you do then?

3808
02:44:52,920 --> 02:44:53,180
Hold on.

3809
02:44:53,220 --> 02:44:53,660
I'll say it after this.

3810
02:44:53,660 --> 02:44:54,340
I'll swim faster.

3811
02:44:54,480 --> 02:44:54,660
Hold on.

3812
02:44:54,660 --> 02:44:55,260
Yeah.

3813
02:44:59,060 --> 02:45:00,040
Oh my god.

3814
02:45:00,520 --> 02:45:01,520
Oh my god.

3815
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:04,020
Ryden you have a girlfriend.

3816
02:45:04,340 --> 02:45:04,760
Hang on tight.

3817
02:45:11,530 --> 02:45:12,730
She's so small.

3818
02:45:12,790 --> 02:45:12,810
Okay.

3819
02:45:12,810 --> 02:45:13,070
Let's go.

3820
02:45:13,210 --> 02:45:14,110
She's so cute.

3821
02:45:14,750 --> 02:45:16,070
I'm closing my eyes.

3822
02:45:16,330 --> 02:45:17,790
Take some deep breaths.

3823
02:45:18,090 --> 02:45:18,690
Deep breaths.

3824
02:45:19,550 --> 02:45:24,090
One and a two and a...

3825
02:45:24,090 --> 02:45:24,790
Three.

3826
02:45:24,850 --> 02:45:25,050
Wait.

3827
02:45:25,050 --> 02:45:25,150
Three.

3828
02:45:26,430 --> 02:45:27,770
What is it?

3829
02:45:28,670 --> 02:45:29,270
I don't know.

3830
02:45:29,270 --> 02:45:30,710
Let me take off my glasses.

3831
02:45:31,450 --> 02:45:33,210
You know you should wear contacts.

3832
02:45:33,370 --> 02:45:35,070
There's nothing wrong with my eyes.

3833
02:45:35,290 --> 02:45:36,510
You should wear contacts.

3834
02:45:37,210 --> 02:45:38,930
You're ugly with your glasses.

3835
02:45:39,690 --> 02:45:41,770
Trying to be different from the other girls?

3836
02:45:42,170 --> 02:45:43,690
No it's not like that.

3837
02:45:43,870 --> 02:45:44,890
I like glasses.

3838
02:45:45,750 --> 02:45:48,410
And there's this guy I like who used to wear them.

3839
02:45:48,670 --> 02:45:49,630
Your first boyfriend?

3840
02:45:50,470 --> 02:45:51,030
No.

3841
02:45:51,690 --> 02:45:52,990
Somebody more important.

3842
02:45:54,630 --> 02:45:55,970
Anyway they bring me luck.

3843
02:45:56,830 --> 02:45:57,390
Yeah.

3844
02:45:57,470 --> 02:45:57,850
I see.

3845
02:45:58,250 --> 02:45:59,030
That's why...

3846
02:45:59,030 --> 02:45:59,250
Why do you have a girlfriend?

3847
02:45:59,250 --> 02:46:00,070
Why did you take them off then?

3848
02:46:00,210 --> 02:46:00,490
Okay.

3849
02:46:00,530 --> 02:46:00,870
Let's go.

3850
02:46:01,050 --> 02:46:01,150
Emma no!

3851
02:46:01,890 --> 02:46:02,570
Emma no!

3852
02:46:04,930 --> 02:46:05,870
Ooh la la.

3853
02:46:06,830 --> 02:46:07,910
A three.

3854
02:46:12,630 --> 02:46:13,190
Okay.

3855
02:46:20,890 --> 02:46:21,710
This one.

3856
02:46:24,350 --> 02:46:25,970
She has small breath.

3857
02:46:26,450 --> 02:46:28,530
She has small breath capacity.

3858
02:46:29,750 --> 02:46:30,310
Okay.

3859
02:46:30,430 --> 02:46:32,930
What I was going to say is...

3860
02:46:35,570 --> 02:46:45,970
There was like a rumor, but it went around, right?

3861
02:46:46,130 --> 02:46:54,470
How they were just like, if you use the posesamine, if you use this, then it'll slow your heartbeat and she'll be able to hold her breath longer.

3862
02:46:54,470 --> 02:46:55,850
But it's not true.

3863
02:46:56,350 --> 02:47:02,850
But then also, it's kind of misleading because they give you this right before you see her.

3864
02:47:03,910 --> 02:47:07,350
So it kind of... it feels like it would be true, you know?

3865
02:47:09,430 --> 02:47:10,630
So a rum... a rumor!

3866
02:47:11,310 --> 02:47:11,750
Wait.

3867
02:47:12,830 --> 02:47:13,270
Yeah.

3868
02:47:14,390 --> 02:47:15,670
I guess so, right?

3869
02:47:19,130 --> 02:47:20,690
That does sound true for this game.

3870
02:47:20,750 --> 02:47:21,390
I know, right?

3871
02:47:21,550 --> 02:47:23,190
It sounds like it really would work, right?

3872
02:47:23,190 --> 02:47:27,230
Especially because he then also says, listen to the sound of my heartbeat.

3873
02:47:27,570 --> 02:47:33,830
And then this is supposed to... well, I don't know if it actually stops... if it makes your heartbeat slow down or whatever, but...

3874
02:47:33,830 --> 02:47:36,030
Old Gaming Magazine said the same thing.

3875
02:47:36,110 --> 02:47:36,270
Yeah!

3876
02:47:36,430 --> 02:47:37,450
It was always not real.

3877
02:47:41,820 --> 02:47:42,300
Misleading.

3878
02:47:46,060 --> 02:47:50,120
I got... I got a... I got a cute babe on my back.

3879
02:47:50,420 --> 02:47:51,840
How do you feel about that, Rose?

3880
02:48:02,840 --> 02:48:03,940
I feel like I need to break into your room.

3881
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:06,060
Rose, just forget about it.

3882
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:07,480
No, listen to me.

3883
02:48:07,560 --> 02:48:12,020
I said I did it because I was worried about you, but it wasn't just that.

3884
02:48:12,200 --> 02:48:12,460
What?

3885
02:48:12,820 --> 02:48:13,840
I was suspicious.

3886
02:48:14,260 --> 02:48:16,180
I thought there might be someone else.

3887
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:17,420
Someone else?

3888
02:48:17,900 --> 02:48:18,800
Another woman.

3889
02:48:19,420 --> 02:48:19,940
Rose...

3890
02:48:19,940 --> 02:48:20,580
In my room?

3891
02:48:20,820 --> 02:48:21,980
I really thought so.

3892
02:48:22,140 --> 02:48:25,260
Because sometimes you're so horribly cold.

3893
02:48:25,980 --> 02:48:26,940
We watched...

3894
02:48:26,940 --> 02:48:27,840
You know I wouldn't...

3895
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:28,780
We watched King Kong together.

3896
02:48:28,780 --> 02:48:28,980
I'm serious.

3897
02:48:29,580 --> 02:48:31,760
Sometimes I feel like you're pushing me away.

3898
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:33,060
So I...

3899
02:48:33,060 --> 02:48:33,900
Did you get in?

3900
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:35,340
Yeah.

3901
02:48:35,580 --> 02:48:36,120
Yeah.

3902
02:48:36,300 --> 02:48:37,420
Are you satisfied now?

3903
02:48:38,080 --> 02:48:40,120
There wasn't anyone there, was there?

3904
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:41,140
No.

3905
02:48:41,640 --> 02:48:43,120
No, there was no one there.

3906
02:48:43,280 --> 02:48:46,520
There was absolutely no one in your room.

3907
02:48:47,040 --> 02:48:48,240
Not another woman.

3908
02:48:48,540 --> 02:48:49,380
Not me.

3909
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:50,860
Not even you.

3910
02:48:51,700 --> 02:48:52,240
Rose...

3911
02:48:52,240 --> 02:48:53,140
I'm sorry.

3912
02:48:53,380 --> 02:48:54,540
I just wanted to apologize.

3913
02:48:54,540 --> 02:48:56,540
I wanted to apologize and then insult you.

3914
02:48:57,420 --> 02:49:00,900
I wanted to apologize and then, you know...

3915
02:49:02,700 --> 02:49:03,400
Hey, Jack.

3916
02:49:10,100 --> 02:49:13,280
Why do we keep going back between 2000 and 2099?

3917
02:49:13,640 --> 02:49:14,560
What's happening?

3918
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:17,660
I think my PS2 is broken.

3919
02:49:19,520 --> 02:49:20,200
Let's see...

3920
02:49:20,200 --> 02:49:20,380
See?

3921
02:49:20,800 --> 02:49:21,860
Take care, Jack.

3922
02:49:22,580 --> 02:49:24,620
Wait, she doesn't care about the girl in the back.

3923
02:49:26,020 --> 02:49:27,520
Maybe... maybe in the next rooms.

3924
02:49:27,620 --> 02:49:28,300
Okay, hold on.

3925
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:31,660
We just came from that way.

3926
02:49:31,780 --> 02:49:32,580
Did we go this way?

3927
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:41,860
Yeah, I think so.

3928
02:49:45,500 --> 02:49:46,080
Yeah, yeah.

3929
02:49:48,320 --> 02:49:49,600
What's in that other way, though?

3930
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,900
What is in the other... should I... did I get everything in the other place?

3931
02:50:00,140 --> 02:50:00,480
You know what?

3932
02:50:01,940 --> 02:50:02,760
Maybe it's fine.

3933
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:07,920
Okay.

3934
02:50:08,480 --> 02:50:09,200
Good job!

3935
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:10,480
Emma!

3936
02:50:13,460 --> 02:50:14,680
Good job, Emma!

3937
02:50:14,680 --> 02:50:14,880
Good job, Emma!

3938
02:50:16,460 --> 02:50:17,440
Put Emma down first?

3939
02:50:17,540 --> 02:50:17,700
Okay.

3940
02:50:17,820 --> 02:50:18,460
Let's go back.

3941
02:50:18,580 --> 02:50:18,760
Yeah.

3942
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:21,920
I want to make sure I got everything.

3943
02:50:22,120 --> 02:50:22,680
Sorry, guys.

3944
02:50:22,940 --> 02:50:24,020
Loot Goblin time!

3945
02:50:26,700 --> 02:50:27,640
Got a Gobble.

3946
02:50:28,040 --> 02:50:28,440
Nope.

3947
02:50:28,520 --> 02:50:28,980
Turn around.

3948
02:50:29,240 --> 02:50:29,520
Turn around.

3949
02:50:31,400 --> 02:50:32,740
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.

3950
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:38,520
Oh, my O2, though, is going to be kind of... not so great because...

3951
02:50:41,100 --> 02:50:41,500
Oh.

3952
02:50:41,640 --> 02:50:43,820
Also, let's put on the ration first.

3953
02:50:43,820 --> 02:50:45,060
Oh, gosh.

3954
02:50:52,740 --> 02:50:54,060
Oh, I did get everything here.

3955
02:50:54,760 --> 02:50:56,240
This is where I accidentally blew up.

3956
02:50:56,980 --> 02:50:59,060
But this room had, like, two bombs in it.

3957
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:01,560
I don't know if it has anything else worth it.

3958
02:51:01,900 --> 02:51:02,300
Okay.

3959
02:51:02,360 --> 02:51:02,840
You know what?

3960
02:51:02,860 --> 02:51:03,200
Never mind.

3961
02:51:03,260 --> 02:51:03,740
Let's just leave.

3962
02:51:05,260 --> 02:51:05,660
Okay.

3963
02:51:05,700 --> 02:51:05,900
Okay.

3964
02:51:05,940 --> 02:51:06,160
I got it.

3965
02:51:11,880 --> 02:51:12,280
Sorry.

3966
02:51:12,480 --> 02:51:14,800
I like to double, triple, quadruple check everything.

3967
02:51:14,920 --> 02:51:15,600
Okay, guys?

3968
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:16,400
That's fine.

3969
02:51:16,980 --> 02:51:17,600
That's fine.

3970
02:51:17,780 --> 02:51:19,200
It takes me no time to get there and back.

3971
02:51:19,440 --> 02:51:19,800
See?

3972
02:51:19,900 --> 02:51:20,340
I'm fast.

3973
02:51:20,600 --> 02:51:21,500
I'm speedy.

3974
02:51:22,260 --> 02:51:25,340
Speed, speed, speed, speed, speed, speed.

3975
02:51:26,520 --> 02:51:26,920
Okay.

3976
02:51:26,920 --> 02:51:28,220
Now we can take her hand.

3977
02:51:28,420 --> 02:51:28,840
Look at her.

3978
02:51:28,860 --> 02:51:29,440
She's sitting there.

3979
02:51:29,480 --> 02:51:30,240
She's waiting for me.

3980
02:51:32,720 --> 02:51:33,360
You okay?

3981
02:51:34,300 --> 02:51:35,520
Are you traumatized?

3982
02:51:35,600 --> 02:51:36,260
Let me rest.

3983
02:51:36,540 --> 02:51:36,860
Oh.

3984
02:51:36,960 --> 02:51:37,920
Just for a second.

3985
02:51:38,140 --> 02:51:38,480
Okay.

3986
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:39,600
Me too.

3987
02:51:39,700 --> 02:51:39,880
Oh!

3988
02:51:40,280 --> 02:51:41,300
I'm regaining life.

3989
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:44,840
I didn't realize that I was bleeding out.

3990
02:51:51,080 --> 02:51:52,540
What does she think of this?

3991
02:51:53,800 --> 02:51:58,080
I am so tired.

3992
02:51:58,500 --> 02:51:58,740
Okay.

3993
02:51:59,220 --> 02:52:00,580
All right, complainy pants.

3994
02:52:03,280 --> 02:52:04,820
What do you think of...

3995
02:52:08,190 --> 02:52:08,710
this?

3996
02:52:09,470 --> 02:52:10,170
Oh, gosh.

3997
02:52:12,230 --> 02:52:14,130
You actually lose so much health.

3998
02:52:17,010 --> 02:52:18,250
I'm so tired.

3999
02:52:18,350 --> 02:52:18,790
I'm tired.

4000
02:52:21,910 --> 02:52:23,190
Jack in the box.

4001
02:52:24,730 --> 02:52:25,350
You okay?

4002
02:52:26,530 --> 02:52:27,030
All right.

4003
02:52:27,070 --> 02:52:27,410
Let's go.

4004
02:52:28,050 --> 02:52:28,570
Come on.

4005
02:52:29,170 --> 02:52:29,690
Get up.

4006
02:52:30,810 --> 02:52:31,610
Oh, sorry.

4007
02:52:33,250 --> 02:52:33,890
Come on.

4008
02:52:35,570 --> 02:52:36,810
I don't remember how I...

4009
02:52:38,370 --> 02:52:39,470
How I take her hand.

4010
02:52:39,630 --> 02:52:39,950
Come here.

4011
02:52:40,430 --> 02:52:41,110
Oh, sorry.

4012
02:52:41,270 --> 02:52:41,550
Sorry.

4013
02:52:41,770 --> 02:52:43,150
Oh, no, no, no, no.

4014
02:52:43,170 --> 02:52:43,390
Sorry.

4015
02:52:43,510 --> 02:52:43,770
Come on.

4016
02:52:43,810 --> 02:52:44,850
Let me grab your hand.

4017
02:52:45,450 --> 02:52:46,190
Grab her hand.

4018
02:52:46,190 --> 02:52:46,710
Oh, sorry.

4019
02:52:46,830 --> 02:52:47,490
Grab her hand.

4020
02:52:48,810 --> 02:52:49,770
Oh, triangle.

4021
02:52:49,830 --> 02:52:50,270
Thanks.

4022
02:52:59,150 --> 02:53:01,150
I was trying to grab her hand.

4023
02:53:01,210 --> 02:53:02,290
I'm awkward, okay?

4024
02:53:02,390 --> 02:53:04,190
Gosh, I have no furniture in my room.

4025
02:53:06,090 --> 02:53:07,190
Don't blame me.

4026
02:53:21,240 --> 02:53:22,600
Just going to chill here.

4027
02:53:24,520 --> 02:53:25,560
You did good.

4028
02:53:25,560 --> 02:53:26,980
You did go...

4029
02:53:26,980 --> 02:53:27,860
It's coming.

4030
02:53:28,120 --> 02:53:29,880
I concentrated on your heartbeat.

4031
02:53:30,180 --> 02:53:30,640
It's coming.

4032
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:33,440
It reminded me of when I was a kid.

4033
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:37,880
My brother had a heartbeat.

4034
02:53:40,380 --> 02:53:42,140
So did my dad.

4035
02:53:48,100 --> 02:53:50,940
I remember my brother giving me a piggyback ride.

4036
02:53:51,760 --> 02:53:54,280
I was sleeping with my ear against his back.

4037
02:53:54,440 --> 02:53:55,580
I could hear his heartbeat.

4038
02:53:56,780 --> 02:53:58,320
Sounds like you were close.

4039
02:53:58,680 --> 02:54:00,520
We were back then.

4040
02:54:01,720 --> 02:54:04,940
We were stepchildren in our parents' second marriages.

4041
02:54:04,980 --> 02:54:06,200
She looks so much like Paj.

4042
02:54:06,220 --> 02:54:08,780
Wherever my brother went, I used to tag along.

4043
02:54:09,260 --> 02:54:09,980
So cute.

4044
02:54:10,520 --> 02:54:12,000
My brother didn't have any close friends.

4045
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:12,180
Damn, girl.

4046
02:54:12,220 --> 02:54:12,540
It's fine.

4047
02:54:12,640 --> 02:54:13,200
It's Huey.

4048
02:54:13,220 --> 02:54:14,200
It's Huey.

4049
02:54:14,220 --> 02:54:14,840
It doesn't matter.

4050
02:54:15,100 --> 02:54:17,100
We both wanted to be loved so much.

4051
02:54:18,100 --> 02:54:20,040
So much that we used to pretend.

4052
02:54:21,340 --> 02:54:21,820
Pretend?

4053
02:54:22,560 --> 02:54:24,100
Yeah, we used to play house.

4054
02:54:24,100 --> 02:54:27,220
My brother was the husband and I was the wife.

4055
02:54:28,620 --> 02:54:30,560
But it was always just make-believe.

4056
02:54:30,700 --> 02:54:31,580
We were only kids.

4057
02:54:32,660 --> 02:54:33,680
Just make-believe.

4058
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:34,580
You know what I mean.

4059
02:54:35,060 --> 02:54:36,400
I never had a family.

4060
02:54:36,580 --> 02:54:36,920
Oh.

4061
02:54:36,940 --> 02:54:37,840
But I think I know what you mean.

4062
02:54:38,060 --> 02:54:40,300
Okay, way to bring it... make it weird, Raiden.

4063
02:54:40,320 --> 02:54:40,860
Here it is!

4064
02:54:41,240 --> 02:54:42,020
Here it is!

4065
02:54:44,020 --> 02:54:45,500
Raiden, what's your status?

4066
02:54:45,840 --> 02:54:46,260
Colonel?

4067
02:54:46,840 --> 02:54:48,280
I've got Emma Emmerich here.

4068
02:54:48,500 --> 02:54:50,360
We managed to avoid drowning.

4069
02:54:50,760 --> 02:54:51,180
Yeah!

4070
02:54:51,640 --> 02:54:53,780
Get her over to Shell One as soon as you can.

4071
02:54:53,780 --> 02:54:57,380
That's going to be hard with the connecting bridge on the upper level destroyed.

4072
02:54:57,800 --> 02:55:01,960
Didn't Olga say something about taking the oil fence at the bottom of Strut L?

4073
02:55:02,540 --> 02:55:03,760
Yeah, I remember that.

4074
02:55:04,020 --> 02:55:06,200
You should be able to go down by way of Strut L.

4075
02:55:06,200 --> 02:55:07,400
He said the thing!

4076
02:55:07,820 --> 02:55:08,920
We've managed to avoid drowning!

4077
02:55:08,920 --> 02:55:09,380
What about Emma?

4078
02:55:09,640 --> 02:55:12,860
She's been injected with something and she can't walk without any help.

4079
02:55:12,940 --> 02:55:16,740
The worst part about being socially awkward is when you try to hold a girl's hand and you end up breaking her neck.

4080
02:55:16,820 --> 02:55:16,960
I know.

4081
02:55:16,960 --> 02:55:19,340
And hold down the action button to give her a hand.

4082
02:55:19,620 --> 02:55:21,380
Oh, you could have told me that sooner.

4083
02:55:21,540 --> 02:55:23,300
Take your finger off the action button.

4084
02:55:23,300 --> 02:55:26,060
Emma can sit and wait until you help her back up.

4085
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:26,420
Colonel!

4086
02:55:26,700 --> 02:55:26,780
And be careful.

4087
02:55:27,160 --> 02:55:30,000
You won't be able to use any weapons while you're leading her.

4088
02:55:30,080 --> 02:55:30,280
Okay.

4089
02:55:30,540 --> 02:55:31,540
Now head for Strut L.

4090
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:32,080
Yeah.

4091
02:55:32,320 --> 02:55:33,460
We're on our way.

4092
02:55:33,660 --> 02:55:34,760
We're on our way!

4093
02:55:37,200 --> 02:55:39,400
Raiden, we've infiltrated the computer room.

4094
02:55:39,560 --> 02:55:40,520
What's your situation?

4095
02:55:40,940 --> 02:55:41,800
Emma's safe.

4096
02:55:41,980 --> 02:55:42,960
We're heading your way.

4097
02:55:43,840 --> 02:55:44,800
Good job.

4098
02:55:45,180 --> 02:55:46,360
Shell One's deserted.

4099
02:55:46,680 --> 02:55:48,500
Looks like everybody's aboard Arsenal.

4100
02:55:48,880 --> 02:55:51,440
I had a look at the system, but there's nothing I can do.

4101
02:55:51,720 --> 02:55:52,940
EE's our only hope.

4102
02:55:52,940 --> 02:55:53,360
Right.

4103
02:55:54,140 --> 02:55:54,840
I'll put her on, then.

4104
02:55:55,240 --> 02:55:55,280
Huh?

4105
02:55:55,620 --> 02:55:56,180
EE?

4106
02:55:56,420 --> 02:55:56,740
What?

4107
02:55:56,940 --> 02:55:57,500
How?

4108
02:55:57,800 --> 02:55:59,860
I'll use my codec as a relay.

4109
02:56:00,680 --> 02:56:01,240
Ahem.

4110
02:56:01,500 --> 02:56:01,720
Ahem.

4111
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:02,980
Here she is.

4112
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:04,320
Huh?

4113
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:05,360
How?

4114
02:56:05,780 --> 02:56:06,140
Oh.

4115
02:56:06,520 --> 02:56:07,080
EE.

4116
02:56:07,480 --> 02:56:08,040
EE?

4117
02:56:08,360 --> 02:56:09,320
Is that you?

4118
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:10,240
How?

4119
02:56:10,820 --> 02:56:11,380
EE.

4120
02:56:11,920 --> 02:56:13,620
Stop calling her that.

4121
02:56:13,840 --> 02:56:15,480
Why are you involved with Metal Gear?

4122
02:56:15,740 --> 02:56:16,160
Huh?

4123
02:56:16,380 --> 02:56:19,380
You knew our family's dark history and still got involved?

4124
02:56:19,700 --> 02:56:20,840
What's wrong with you?

4125
02:56:21,020 --> 02:56:22,220
I should have known.

4126
02:56:22,380 --> 02:56:22,920
I'm sorry.

4127
02:56:22,940 --> 02:56:23,420
Answer me.

4128
02:56:23,460 --> 02:56:25,220
Why are you repeating the same mistake?

4129
02:56:25,220 --> 02:56:25,760
She has no thoughts.

4130
02:56:26,080 --> 02:56:27,000
I can't tell her.

4131
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:27,920
I wanted to hurt you.

4132
02:56:28,020 --> 02:56:29,480
I can't R1 and R2 her.

4133
02:56:29,700 --> 02:56:29,860
I wanted to see you suffer.

4134
02:56:30,220 --> 02:56:30,580
EE?

4135
02:56:30,980 --> 02:56:31,360
EE?

4136
02:56:31,360 --> 02:56:32,180
You abandoned me.

4137
02:56:32,460 --> 02:56:32,840
No.

4138
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:34,180
That's not what happened.

4139
02:56:34,420 --> 02:56:34,900
All right.

4140
02:56:35,180 --> 02:56:35,940
That's enough.

4141
02:56:36,360 --> 02:56:36,880
Huh.

4142
02:56:37,180 --> 02:56:38,060
Who are you?

4143
02:56:38,320 --> 02:56:40,060
I'm a friend of Otacon's, Emma.

4144
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:41,400
Otacon.

4145
02:56:41,420 --> 02:56:41,940
Otacon.

4146
02:56:41,940 --> 02:56:43,360
Enough with the sibling rivalry.

4147
02:56:43,820 --> 02:56:44,920
That's not what this is.

4148
02:56:45,060 --> 02:56:46,640
We haven't got time for this.

4149
02:56:46,640 --> 02:56:47,100
Ryan.

4150
02:56:47,140 --> 02:56:47,760
He has a nickname that's better than mine.

4151
02:56:47,760 --> 02:56:49,080
Get her over here right now.

4152
02:56:49,480 --> 02:56:50,000
I...

4153
02:56:50,640 --> 02:56:51,160
I...

4154
02:56:51,960 --> 02:56:52,480
EE.

4155
02:56:52,500 --> 02:56:52,920
EE.

4156
02:56:52,920 --> 02:56:53,400
Gotcha, Snake.

4157
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:54,760
I'll head over there with Emma.

4158
02:56:55,020 --> 02:56:58,500
Most of the enemies aboard Arsenal, but I suggest you be careful.

4159
02:56:58,620 --> 02:56:58,880
Maybe.

4160
02:56:59,220 --> 02:57:00,840
Make sure Emma gets here in one piece.

4161
02:57:01,220 --> 02:57:02,900
Ryden, take care of my sister.

4162
02:57:03,220 --> 02:57:03,880
Don't worry.

4163
02:57:04,040 --> 02:57:04,800
I'll get her there.

4164
02:57:08,540 --> 02:57:08,940
Yep.

4165
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:09,400
Most...

4166
02:57:09,400 --> 02:57:10,960
The enemies should be all...

4167
02:57:10,960 --> 02:57:13,020
All of them should be on Arsenal, right?

4168
02:57:14,640 --> 02:57:15,040
Oh.

4169
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:16,600
Wait.

4170
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:17,020
What was that?

4171
02:57:18,460 --> 02:57:18,860
Oh.

4172
02:57:18,920 --> 02:57:19,380
Just kidding.

4173
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:21,000
My cell phone's going off.

4174
02:57:22,420 --> 02:57:22,820
Hello?

4175
02:57:22,820 --> 02:57:22,900
Hello?

4176
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:23,020
Hello?

4177
02:57:23,020 --> 02:57:23,200
Hello?

4178
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:23,760
Hello?

4179
02:57:23,760 --> 02:57:24,080
Hello?

4180
02:57:25,280 --> 02:57:26,320
Be careful.

4181
02:57:26,480 --> 02:57:27,700
Claymore Mines are set there?

4182
02:57:30,720 --> 02:57:31,760
There are?

4183
02:57:34,360 --> 02:57:34,880
Wait.

4184
02:57:34,960 --> 02:57:35,340
Actually?

4185
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:38,440
Also, how'd you know where I was?

4186
02:57:38,720 --> 02:57:39,500
You freak?

4187
02:57:42,860 --> 02:57:44,240
Where's my Mine Detector?

4188
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:47,520
Sorry.

4189
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:50,600
I don't remember where a lot of stuff is.

4190
02:57:51,300 --> 02:57:51,820
What's that?

4191
02:57:52,380 --> 02:57:52,900
Just a lasso?

4192
02:57:53,600 --> 02:57:54,920
Oh, mind detector, there it is.

4193
02:57:56,820 --> 02:57:57,300
Wow!

4194
02:57:58,360 --> 02:58:00,020
They just set these here!

4195
02:58:00,320 --> 02:58:00,920
Like crazy!

4196
02:58:01,180 --> 02:58:02,560
Why are they there?

4197
02:58:05,140 --> 02:58:06,440
Why are they there?

4198
02:58:06,480 --> 02:58:07,300
That's so funny.

4199
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:08,360
Come on, E.E.

4200
02:58:11,220 --> 02:58:11,760
Let's go.

4201
02:58:12,960 --> 02:58:13,440
Okay.

4202
02:58:13,580 --> 02:58:14,540
Oh, my heart.

4203
02:58:16,180 --> 02:58:17,440
Oh, my heart.

4204
02:58:17,460 --> 02:58:18,380
Oh, my heart.

4205
02:58:18,400 --> 02:58:19,180
Oh, my heart.

4206
02:58:19,240 --> 02:58:20,060
To troll you.

4207
02:58:20,300 --> 02:58:21,740
Well, who would go the long way?

4208
02:58:21,740 --> 02:58:22,640
Guess me.

4209
02:58:24,500 --> 02:58:25,340
Oh, gosh.

4210
02:58:25,740 --> 02:58:26,900
Oh, gosh.

4211
02:58:26,920 --> 02:58:28,480
I've never walked that direction.

4212
02:58:28,700 --> 02:58:30,200
I don't think I remember that either.

4213
02:58:35,720 --> 02:58:36,320
Yeah.

4214
02:58:51,740 --> 02:58:53,040
Did something happen to the president?

4215
02:58:53,360 --> 02:58:53,440
No.

4216
02:58:55,700 --> 02:58:56,320
No!

4217
02:59:03,680 --> 02:59:04,920
Dramatic flashback.

4218
02:59:05,480 --> 02:59:06,440
It's dead!

4219
02:59:08,880 --> 02:59:09,880
It wasn't me, though.

4220
02:59:10,460 --> 02:59:12,260
You actually wrote this virus?

4221
02:59:12,780 --> 02:59:14,280
It's not really a virus.

4222
02:59:14,560 --> 02:59:16,260
It's more like a worm cluster.

4223
02:59:16,520 --> 02:59:17,020
Worm.

4224
02:59:17,020 --> 02:59:21,800
It's actually a delayed-effect autonomous program that's designed to invade GW's cerebrum...

4225
02:59:22,560 --> 02:59:23,180
A worm?

4226
02:59:23,180 --> 02:59:23,600
It's useless.

4227
02:59:23,860 --> 02:59:25,280
You know what GW is?

4228
02:59:25,440 --> 02:59:26,080
Of course.

4229
02:59:26,400 --> 02:59:27,600
I created it.

4230
02:59:28,420 --> 02:59:28,940
Huh?

4231
02:59:29,400 --> 02:59:30,400
You look surprised.

4232
02:59:31,060 --> 02:59:31,580
Huh?

4233
02:59:31,580 --> 02:59:32,360
Uh, well...

4234
02:59:32,360 --> 02:59:33,520
Cat got your tongue?

4235
02:59:33,920 --> 02:59:34,680
I'm sorry.

4236
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:35,520
I...

4237
02:59:36,920 --> 02:59:38,320
How about the Patriots?

4238
02:59:38,340 --> 02:59:38,960
Ever heard of them?

4239
02:59:39,520 --> 02:59:40,040
Yes.

4240
02:59:40,320 --> 02:59:42,240
But I only know what I've been told.

4241
02:59:42,420 --> 02:59:45,780
How is Emma told so much at her... like...

4242
02:59:45,780 --> 02:59:46,420
Can you tell me what you know?

4243
02:59:46,420 --> 02:59:47,920
She's, like, so young.

4244
02:59:48,300 --> 02:59:48,360
Sure.

4245
02:59:48,360 --> 02:59:49,700
But it's hard to put into words.

4246
02:59:50,220 --> 02:59:51,700
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

4247
02:59:51,900 --> 02:59:52,360
All right.

4248
02:59:53,180 --> 02:59:54,000
Thank you.

4249
02:59:56,680 --> 02:59:58,140
Are you reading me, Emma?

4250
02:59:58,300 --> 02:59:58,760
Yes.

4251
02:59:58,920 --> 02:59:59,660
Loud and clear.

4252
02:59:59,980 --> 03:00:03,800
The President said that Arsenal gear was the Patriots' key to supremacy.

4253
03:00:04,240 --> 03:00:05,860
That's as good a description as any.

4254
03:00:06,080 --> 03:00:07,360
What exactly is it?

4255
03:00:07,640 --> 03:00:12,540
It's a massive data-processing system capable of controlling information on a global scale.

4256
03:00:12,900 --> 03:00:14,560
A data-processing system?

4257
03:00:14,860 --> 03:00:15,360
That's right.

4258
03:00:15,580 --> 03:00:18,320
The system's a social device for maintaining the Patriots' control.

4259
03:00:18,480 --> 03:00:19,220
Emma actually reads her work even.

4260
03:00:19,220 --> 03:00:19,920
You've lost me.

4261
03:00:19,920 --> 03:00:24,820
Well, in this day and age, information emerges from every direction and is freely distributed.

4262
03:00:24,980 --> 03:00:33,800
A variety of information gathered by servers employing the latest in high-speed communication networks and P2P technology is rapidly circulated to individuals.

4263
03:00:34,240 --> 03:00:39,000
In fact, the speed of this circulation process is accelerating on an almost daily basis.

4264
03:00:39,400 --> 03:00:41,920
The Patriots seem to be afraid of this development.

4265
03:00:42,340 --> 03:00:46,220
Apparently, they believe that their role will shift from dominant to dominated.

4266
03:00:46,520 --> 03:00:46,860
Whoa.

4267
03:00:47,240 --> 03:00:48,700
Let me give you an example.

4268
03:00:49,220 --> 03:00:52,380
You're aware of Solid Snake's anti-Metal Gear activities, aren't you?

4269
03:00:52,500 --> 03:00:52,800
Yeah.

4270
03:00:52,920 --> 03:00:54,560
Yeah, I know a little about it.

4271
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:57,360
Well, that's just a small sample of uncontrolled information.

4272
03:00:57,920 --> 03:01:01,740
I can guarantee you the Patriots did not want Solid Snake's name publicized.

4273
03:01:02,220 --> 03:01:02,460
Whoa.

4274
03:01:02,720 --> 03:01:03,860
Now, look at it like this.

4275
03:01:04,080 --> 03:01:05,700
Political scandals, corporate corruption...

4276
03:01:06,320 --> 03:01:06,480
Scandal.

4277
03:01:06,480 --> 03:01:11,080
Up until now, the Patriots have managed to keep a lid on these and other self-serving events.

4278
03:01:11,300 --> 03:01:18,680
But with their existing data-processing system, they're no longer able to effectively control the flow of information generated at the individual level.

4279
03:01:18,680 --> 03:01:22,700
With the new created system, they can fully regulate digital information.

4280
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:28,200
High-level information can be categorized in stages, given clearance levels, and deleted as necessary.

4281
03:01:28,200 --> 03:01:29,240
Where do I know this voice from?

4282
03:01:29,280 --> 03:01:30,020
It's Jennifer Hale.

4283
03:01:31,180 --> 03:01:36,420
By deleting such information, the Patriots can shape the course of history as they see fit.

4284
03:01:36,840 --> 03:01:38,260
Somebody's bound to catch on.

4285
03:01:38,560 --> 03:01:38,780
No.

4286
03:01:38,920 --> 03:01:43,440
The memory capacity, not to mention the lifespan of the average individual, is extremely limited.

4287
03:01:43,780 --> 03:01:47,480
On the other hand, digital information lasts virtually forever.

4288
03:01:47,480 --> 03:01:48,600
It doesn't deteriorate.

4289
03:01:49,060 --> 03:01:49,500
So?

4290
03:01:50,100 --> 03:01:50,920
The alphabet.

4291
03:01:51,180 --> 03:01:52,140
26 letters, right?

4292
03:01:52,300 --> 03:01:53,620
It could have been 30 letters.

4293
03:01:53,820 --> 03:01:56,340
What if the four deleted letters were controlled by a program?

4294
03:01:56,940 --> 03:01:57,460
Impossible.

4295
03:01:57,800 --> 03:01:58,240
My brain.

4296
03:01:58,240 --> 03:01:58,460
It's not.

4297
03:01:58,660 --> 03:02:00,360
In fact, something similar is already in the web.

4298
03:02:00,360 --> 03:02:01,860
My brain here is just whole.

4299
03:02:01,900 --> 03:02:03,680
Do you know how many genes exist in an individual?

4300
03:02:04,120 --> 03:02:05,720
About 30 to 40,000?

4301
03:02:06,260 --> 03:02:06,780
Right.

4302
03:02:06,920 --> 03:02:08,920
That's what was announced at the turn of the century.

4303
03:02:09,160 --> 03:02:09,440
What?

4304
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:14,240
There's actually 100,000, according to the original theory advanced by the scientific community.

4305
03:02:14,700 --> 03:02:17,460
Information regarding the remaining 60,000 remains.

4306
03:02:17,480 --> 03:02:18,680
The gene was suppressed by the Patriots.

4307
03:02:19,220 --> 03:02:19,780
Why?

4308
03:02:20,260 --> 03:02:21,120
How would you know?

4309
03:02:21,620 --> 03:02:22,980
Do you know what a gene looks like?

4310
03:02:23,020 --> 03:02:23,860
Did you count them yourself?

4311
03:02:24,280 --> 03:02:25,920
There are research organizations.

4312
03:02:26,600 --> 03:02:27,400
Of course.

4313
03:02:27,820 --> 03:02:30,280
And their reports have already been subtly altered.

4314
03:02:30,640 --> 03:02:33,100
They're even beginning to believe the doctored reports.

4315
03:02:33,700 --> 03:02:39,120
GW is a system that allows the Patriots to decide what will be recorded in tomorrow's history.

4316
03:02:39,760 --> 03:02:47,120
So what we're talking about is one huge censorship system for deleting information which might be inconvenient to the Patriots.

4317
03:02:47,120 --> 03:02:47,780
Exactly.

4318
03:02:48,820 --> 03:02:53,980
The actual physical core for handling the task, GW, is installed in Arsenal.

4319
03:02:54,280 --> 03:03:01,680
It's the only system in the world with an optic neural AI that has a parallel processing capacity of 980 trillion Hamets.

4320
03:03:01,880 --> 03:03:09,760
I suppose that being a specialist in neural AI and complex logic played a significant role in your association with the Metal Gear project.

4321
03:03:10,220 --> 03:03:11,520
That's not the only reason.

4322
03:03:11,800 --> 03:03:12,700
What do you mean?

4323
03:03:13,180 --> 03:03:16,060
I guess there are plenty of other reasons.

4324
03:03:16,060 --> 03:03:17,680
Yes, there are.

4325
03:03:17,960 --> 03:03:18,840
I understand.

4326
03:03:19,380 --> 03:03:20,000
Do you?

4327
03:03:20,440 --> 03:03:24,840
So Arsenal Gear was actually designed to protect the GW system, wasn't it?

4328
03:03:25,580 --> 03:03:26,360
Um, yes.

4329
03:03:26,580 --> 03:03:29,400
It's armed with everything, including nuclear weapons.

4330
03:03:29,500 --> 03:03:31,520
Why did you create something like this, Emma?

4331
03:03:33,640 --> 03:03:34,980
What the hell?

4332
03:03:35,700 --> 03:03:38,840
But is the AI actually capable of controlling everything?

4333
03:03:39,360 --> 03:03:39,700
No.

4334
03:03:39,800 --> 03:03:41,920
GW is only the system's core.

4335
03:03:42,140 --> 03:03:44,660
It's only for deciding what data is stored or deleted.

4336
03:03:44,660 --> 03:03:50,160
The actual subsystem for executing the task exists within our social structure.

4337
03:03:50,380 --> 03:03:50,840
What?

4338
03:03:51,060 --> 03:03:52,820
You freak.

4339
03:03:54,080 --> 03:03:57,980
Do you remember the panic that gripped the computer industry prior to the end of the century?

4340
03:03:58,520 --> 03:04:00,260
You mean the Y2K problem?

4341
03:04:00,480 --> 03:04:00,520
Y2K!

4342
03:04:00,520 --> 03:04:01,200
That's exactly it!

4343
03:04:01,400 --> 03:04:02,520
Yeah, Y2K!

4344
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:08,960
If you call, our government supplied the world with a countermeasure program using the internet at full capacity.

4345
03:04:09,280 --> 03:04:09,880
Y2K.

4346
03:04:09,880 --> 03:04:09,900
CloudStrike.

4347
03:04:09,900 --> 03:04:14,640
The program was distributed to every government organization, every key facility throughout the world.

4348
03:04:14,640 --> 03:04:21,520
In addition, the same program was included in an OS application for distribution among the public.

4349
03:04:24,600 --> 03:04:26,120
Definitely making out.

4350
03:04:26,260 --> 03:04:26,320
Let me guess.

4351
03:04:26,540 --> 03:04:30,820
The Y2K countermeasure contained a program designed by the Patriots.

4352
03:04:31,020 --> 03:04:31,460
Yes.

4353
03:04:31,480 --> 03:04:35,140
And everything supplied from that day onward contains the same program.

4354
03:04:35,620 --> 03:04:36,220
Impossible.

4355
03:04:36,620 --> 03:04:38,160
Do you know how a computer operates?

4356
03:04:38,440 --> 03:04:41,220
Do you really know the basic principles on how data is exchanged?

4357
03:04:41,700 --> 03:04:42,240
Uh...

4358
03:04:42,240 --> 03:04:44,540
Nobody's aware of it, but there's a subsystem...

4359
03:04:44,540 --> 03:04:45,700
I forgot our previous prompt.

4360
03:04:45,720 --> 03:04:46,660
...that's about to be activated.

4361
03:04:46,980 --> 03:04:52,340
Is that why Solidus wants to burn out every electrical circuit in Manhattan with a nuclear blast?

4362
03:04:52,700 --> 03:04:52,740
No.

4363
03:04:52,860 --> 03:04:53,300
Probably.

4364
03:04:53,560 --> 03:04:55,820
But the overall system isn't actually complete.

4365
03:04:56,160 --> 03:04:56,540
What?

4366
03:04:56,780 --> 03:05:00,240
It still lacks the necessary factors for judging situations.

4367
03:05:00,840 --> 03:05:06,160
I heard they were planning a major experiment in the next few days to provide complex data for GW to study.

4368
03:05:06,700 --> 03:05:08,460
And suddenly all this happens.

4369
03:05:08,840 --> 03:05:08,860
Sound cute.

4370
03:05:09,360 --> 03:05:10,640
Emma, it's not your fault.

4371
03:05:10,760 --> 03:05:12,660
If it wasn't for the terrorists...

4372
03:05:12,660 --> 03:05:14,200
Yeah, you're right.

4373
03:05:14,200 --> 03:05:15,120
I-I mean...

4374
03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:15,520
Well...

4375
03:05:16,020 --> 03:05:17,280
I think that's about all I know.

4376
03:05:17,400 --> 03:05:18,180
But you still...

4377
03:05:18,180 --> 03:05:18,320
Right.

4378
03:05:18,560 --> 03:05:19,000
I'm...

4379
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:19,780
Uh, thanks.

4380
03:05:20,020 --> 03:05:20,760
But the...

4381
03:05:20,760 --> 03:05:21,660
I think we'd better head for the computer room.

4382
03:05:21,660 --> 03:05:22,820
But I think you still...

4383
03:05:22,820 --> 03:05:24,460
My bird in the computer room.

4384
03:05:24,600 --> 03:05:25,340
Is he safe?

4385
03:05:25,380 --> 03:05:26,040
Your bird!

4386
03:05:27,460 --> 03:05:29,300
That noisy overgrown parakeet?

4387
03:05:29,780 --> 03:05:31,220
Excuse me, he's a parrot.

4388
03:05:31,600 --> 03:05:32,940
And he's my best friend.

4389
03:05:33,580 --> 03:05:34,160
My only friend.

4390
03:05:34,160 --> 03:05:35,040
He's very cute.

4391
03:05:35,380 --> 03:05:36,400
Well, the bird's okay.

4392
03:05:38,080 --> 03:05:38,520
Good.

4393
03:05:38,520 --> 03:05:43,680
Did you know that in the old days, miners used to take a canary into the mine shafts to detect toxic gas?

4394
03:05:43,780 --> 03:05:44,160
Yeah.

4395
03:05:44,640 --> 03:05:45,420
That's what he's for?

4396
03:05:45,900 --> 03:05:46,300
No.

4397
03:05:46,740 --> 03:05:47,140
No.

4398
03:05:47,280 --> 03:05:48,580
I really needed someone to talk to.

4399
03:05:48,700 --> 03:05:49,800
Why'd you bring that up then?

4400
03:05:50,660 --> 03:05:51,060
Right.

4401
03:05:51,180 --> 03:05:52,360
I think we'd better get moving.

4402
03:05:52,480 --> 03:05:53,040
Look at that guy.

4403
03:05:53,320 --> 03:05:53,960
He's so cute.

4404
03:05:55,260 --> 03:05:57,440
We've got a little longer to cover than the last time.

4405
03:05:57,640 --> 03:05:58,500
I'll give it my best.

4406
03:05:58,720 --> 03:05:58,940
Yeah.

4407
03:05:58,980 --> 03:06:00,640
Whatever you do, don't open your eyes.

4408
03:06:00,800 --> 03:06:01,280
Why not?

4409
03:06:01,460 --> 03:06:02,400
There's a dead guy.

4410
03:06:02,960 --> 03:06:02,980
A dead body, not a pretty sight.

4411
03:06:06,040 --> 03:06:07,540
Why do they have to do it again?

4412
03:06:07,840 --> 03:06:08,360
It'll be too dark to see anything.

4413
03:06:08,700 --> 03:06:10,200
Who put more mines there?

4414
03:06:10,760 --> 03:06:11,660
Who did that?

4415
03:06:11,980 --> 03:06:12,380
I don't know.

4416
03:06:15,720 --> 03:06:16,120
I don't know.

4417
03:06:16,120 --> 03:06:16,700
Okay.

4418
03:06:16,940 --> 03:06:18,140
What are those sticks in your head?

4419
03:06:18,800 --> 03:06:19,240
These?

4420
03:06:19,920 --> 03:06:20,360
Decoration?

4421
03:06:20,740 --> 03:06:21,460
They're lacquered chopsticks.

4422
03:06:22,180 --> 03:06:23,480
They hold your hair in place.

4423
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,480
Did you know that they're pretty popular in Europe and South America?

4424
03:06:26,660 --> 03:06:28,120
What are those sticks in your head?

4425
03:06:28,400 --> 03:06:28,440
Can't say that I do.

4426
03:06:28,560 --> 03:06:30,900
You're not only cute, but smart too.

4427
03:06:31,300 --> 03:06:31,620
Oh.

4428
03:06:32,220 --> 03:06:33,400
I'm much more than cute.

4429
03:06:34,740 --> 03:06:35,820
She's so cute.

4430
03:06:35,980 --> 03:06:36,420
Okay.

4431
03:06:36,420 --> 03:06:36,880
Let's go.

4432
03:06:37,200 --> 03:06:38,320
Raiden, you have a girlfriend.

4433
03:06:40,700 --> 03:06:43,160
How did they let her keep a pet in the workplace?

4434
03:06:44,720 --> 03:06:46,100
They didn't even let her work.

4435
03:06:46,120 --> 03:06:48,240
I don't know how her pet is in a completely different area.

4436
03:06:49,980 --> 03:06:51,020
Hey, Rose.

4437
03:06:51,420 --> 03:06:52,620
How do you like it now?

4438
03:06:54,040 --> 03:06:55,140
Jack, is that you?

4439
03:06:55,460 --> 03:06:55,960
Yeah.

4440
03:06:56,540 --> 03:06:58,300
You like her on my back?

4441
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:00,160
You like this?

4442
03:07:01,480 --> 03:07:02,900
You like what you see?

4443
03:07:09,600 --> 03:07:13,260
Well, Jack, it sounds like you and Miss Emma are getting along just fine.

4444
03:07:13,460 --> 03:07:13,960
Rose?

4445
03:07:14,260 --> 03:07:16,900
I've been monitoring your every move and conversation.

4446
03:07:16,900 --> 03:07:18,800
I can't say it's been fun.

4447
03:07:19,040 --> 03:07:19,920
Give me a break.

4448
03:07:20,140 --> 03:07:22,000
I'm only trying to keep her spirits up.

4449
03:07:22,100 --> 03:07:22,940
Is that right?

4450
03:07:23,080 --> 03:07:23,120
Yeah, yeah.

4451
03:07:23,360 --> 03:07:23,840
Absolutely.

4452
03:07:24,180 --> 03:07:26,680
My mission is to get her to the computer room.

4453
03:07:26,920 --> 03:07:27,460
That's all?

4454
03:07:27,860 --> 03:07:28,160
Yeah.

4455
03:07:28,320 --> 03:07:29,200
You're lying.

4456
03:07:29,420 --> 03:07:31,060
You're attracted to her, aren't you?

4457
03:07:31,300 --> 03:07:32,700
I'll admit she's cute.

4458
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:33,900
Cuter than me?

4459
03:07:34,100 --> 03:07:34,460
Oh, my God.

4460
03:07:34,460 --> 03:07:35,560
Rose, you're beautiful.

4461
03:07:35,740 --> 03:07:37,320
You know how I feel about you.

4462
03:07:37,540 --> 03:07:38,760
Have you remembered yet?

4463
03:07:38,980 --> 03:07:40,320
You mean April 30th?

4464
03:07:40,400 --> 03:07:40,780
Yes.

4465
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:42,380
It's your birthday, isn't it?

4466
03:07:42,560 --> 03:07:43,000
Wrong.

4467
03:07:43,260 --> 03:07:44,640
You're not even warm.

4468
03:07:44,900 --> 03:07:45,820
What is it, then?

4469
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:46,760
Forget it.

4470
03:07:46,780 --> 03:07:46,880
I don't know.

4471
03:07:46,900 --> 03:07:48,200
You don't even know her birthday?

4472
03:07:48,200 --> 03:07:49,100
I'm just a little jealous.

4473
03:07:50,940 --> 03:07:52,640
Rose, you better get moving.

4474
03:07:52,860 --> 03:07:53,540
Good luck.

4475
03:07:54,140 --> 03:07:55,800
He doesn't even know her birthday.

4476
03:07:55,840 --> 03:07:57,440
He's like, it's your birthday, isn't it?

4477
03:07:59,840 --> 03:08:00,600
This guy.

4478
03:08:00,920 --> 03:08:03,140
Ryden, take Emma and go to Strut L.

4479
03:08:03,240 --> 03:08:03,620
Okay.

4480
03:08:03,640 --> 03:08:07,540
There's a ladder down onto the oil fence on the ocean surface from that strut.

4481
03:08:09,380 --> 03:08:09,860
Wait.

4482
03:08:10,320 --> 03:08:11,260
Tell me more.

4483
03:08:12,980 --> 03:08:14,960
The most toxic relationship in MGM.

4484
03:08:14,960 --> 03:08:14,980
Okay, Ryden.

4485
03:08:14,980 --> 03:08:15,880
Let me talk to Emma.

4486
03:08:15,960 --> 03:08:16,460
Oh, okay.

4487
03:08:16,460 --> 03:08:16,640
Sure.

4488
03:08:16,640 --> 03:08:16,860
Okay.

4489
03:08:16,860 --> 03:08:16,880
Okay.

4490
03:08:16,900 --> 03:08:17,100
No arguing.

4491
03:08:17,100 --> 03:08:17,380
One condition.

4492
03:08:17,840 --> 03:08:18,820
No arguing.

4493
03:08:19,480 --> 03:08:20,380
No problem.

4494
03:08:20,520 --> 03:08:21,200
Put her on.

4495
03:08:21,820 --> 03:08:23,380
E.E., is that you?

4496
03:08:23,700 --> 03:08:24,220
Yes.

4497
03:08:24,360 --> 03:08:25,300
What do you want?

4498
03:08:25,540 --> 03:08:27,720
Why did you get involved in weapons development?

4499
03:08:28,560 --> 03:08:30,240
A lot of people will get hurt.

4500
03:08:30,400 --> 03:08:31,540
Even more will die.

4501
03:08:31,920 --> 03:08:37,580
I'm talking about the destruction of homes and cities, radioactive contamination for years to come.

4502
03:08:37,700 --> 03:08:41,060
You, of all people, should know the horror of nuclear weapons.

4503
03:08:41,200 --> 03:08:43,720
You know about our family's dark history.

4504
03:08:43,840 --> 03:08:44,180
Yeah.

4505
03:08:44,200 --> 03:08:45,300
Why, E.E., why?

4506
03:08:45,660 --> 03:08:46,740
You left me.

4507
03:08:46,760 --> 03:08:46,880
You left me.

4508
03:08:46,900 --> 03:08:47,340
No fighting.

4509
03:08:47,420 --> 03:08:48,700
You made my life a living hell.

4510
03:08:48,740 --> 03:08:49,120
No fighting.

4511
03:08:49,260 --> 03:08:50,240
I didn't have a choice.

4512
03:08:50,620 --> 03:08:51,600
Don't lie to me.

4513
03:08:51,920 --> 03:08:52,620
The pool.

4514
03:08:52,740 --> 03:08:54,940
You could never look me in the eye after the accident.

4515
03:08:55,260 --> 03:08:57,920
You took the easy way out so you wouldn't have to face me.

4516
03:08:58,040 --> 03:09:00,920
That way you could avoid responsibility every day.

4517
03:09:01,040 --> 03:09:01,640
The girls are fighting.

4518
03:09:01,660 --> 03:09:01,800
You ran.

4519
03:09:02,020 --> 03:09:04,260
You ran away so you wouldn't have to face the pain.

4520
03:09:04,560 --> 03:09:04,960
No.

4521
03:09:05,220 --> 03:09:06,580
That's not why I left.

4522
03:09:06,860 --> 03:09:09,660
You left me and took the easy way out.

4523
03:09:10,100 --> 03:09:10,920
That's not true.

4524
03:09:11,100 --> 03:09:12,740
I left the house because...

4525
03:09:12,740 --> 03:09:14,720
You're a criminal, just like me.

4526
03:09:15,440 --> 03:09:16,240
A criminal?

4527
03:09:16,900 --> 03:09:18,660
I know what you did.

4528
03:09:18,840 --> 03:09:21,080
You manipulated our account on the network.

4529
03:09:21,320 --> 03:09:23,380
Look at what you're doing now.

4530
03:09:23,500 --> 03:09:24,640
You're nothing but a cracker.

4531
03:09:24,700 --> 03:09:25,380
A what?

4532
03:09:25,580 --> 03:09:27,740
I'm just applying my knowledge for the cause.

4533
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:28,860
The cause?

4534
03:09:29,080 --> 03:09:29,760
What cause?

4535
03:09:30,040 --> 03:09:30,540
Justice?

4536
03:09:31,040 --> 03:09:32,560
For peace, E.E.

4537
03:09:32,740 --> 03:09:34,040
I'm not like Snake.

4538
03:09:34,260 --> 03:09:36,900
I can't carry a gun and face the enemy.

4539
03:09:37,060 --> 03:09:39,140
That's why I do what I do best.

4540
03:09:39,460 --> 03:09:40,060
Oh, right.

4541
03:09:40,160 --> 03:09:41,780
Nice justification, Hal.

4542
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:43,360
Forget about being a criminal.

4543
03:09:43,480 --> 03:09:44,740
You'd make a great lawyer.

4544
03:09:44,940 --> 03:09:45,920
Maybe she meant hacker.

4545
03:09:45,980 --> 03:09:46,500
That's why I do what I do best.

4546
03:09:46,500 --> 03:09:46,880
That's why I do what I do best.

4547
03:09:46,900 --> 03:09:47,180
That's enough.

4548
03:09:47,880 --> 03:09:51,780
Mr. No-nonsense coming in to stop them from fighting.

4549
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:54,480
Emma.

4550
03:09:55,480 --> 03:09:56,520
What's up, Raiden?

4551
03:09:57,380 --> 03:09:58,520
Out of my way.

4552
03:09:58,580 --> 03:09:59,220
Let me talk.

4553
03:09:59,460 --> 03:10:00,760
You want to talk to Otacon?

4554
03:10:01,060 --> 03:10:01,540
Yes.

4555
03:10:01,640 --> 03:10:02,120
Yes.

4556
03:10:02,140 --> 03:10:02,740
I'll put him on.

4557
03:10:03,600 --> 03:10:04,080
Yeah?

4558
03:10:04,240 --> 03:10:04,980
What is it?

4559
03:10:05,180 --> 03:10:08,940
Up to now, scientists have continued to be active participants in war.

4560
03:10:09,280 --> 03:10:10,180
What's your opinion?

4561
03:10:10,440 --> 03:10:10,960
What's your...

4562
03:10:10,960 --> 03:10:12,060
Oh, the way she leans in.

4563
03:10:12,100 --> 03:10:15,080
There's no doubt that war has been an ideal event that fuels the progress of science.

4564
03:10:15,140 --> 03:10:15,540
What's your opinion?

4565
03:10:15,540 --> 03:10:16,880
But therein lies the truth.

4566
03:10:17,380 --> 03:10:20,940
We scientists must establish some form of work ethic.

4567
03:10:21,360 --> 03:10:26,220
It's a tragedy that both the government and the military act as sponsors to modern science.

4568
03:10:26,520 --> 03:10:27,820
What are you talking about?

4569
03:10:27,980 --> 03:10:34,100
The atom and hydrogen bombs were born from laboratories owned and operated by universities and private enterprises.

4570
03:10:34,640 --> 03:10:38,000
Los Alamos and the Lawrence Livermore labs were run by universities.

4571
03:10:38,020 --> 03:10:38,460
She's popping off.

4572
03:10:38,460 --> 03:10:39,560
There's nothing strange about that.

4573
03:10:39,980 --> 03:10:41,760
Weapons development and universities.

4574
03:10:42,380 --> 03:10:44,100
This may come as a surprise.

4575
03:10:44,180 --> 03:10:46,860
But science requires that information be...

4576
03:10:46,860 --> 03:10:47,820
...exchanged freely.

4577
03:10:48,260 --> 03:10:50,060
You're referring to the will of Professor Oppenheimer, aren't you?

4578
03:10:50,060 --> 03:10:51,640
Hacker who breaks into secure systems.

4579
03:10:51,700 --> 03:10:52,060
See?

4580
03:10:52,180 --> 03:10:53,080
I told you it was hacker.

4581
03:10:53,500 --> 03:10:59,660
I never thought that my research results would bring about misfortune to others.

4582
03:10:59,820 --> 03:11:02,380
That was until the Shadow Moses incident.

4583
03:11:02,900 --> 03:11:03,940
I have no regrets.

4584
03:11:04,520 --> 03:11:05,040
Damn!

4585
03:11:05,360 --> 03:11:05,800
That's where you're wrong.

4586
03:11:06,060 --> 03:11:08,180
We scientists know the dangers of...

4587
03:11:08,180 --> 03:11:08,500
Oh my god, Emma!

4588
03:11:08,900 --> 03:11:10,900
It's up to us to protect the people.

4589
03:11:11,100 --> 03:11:13,340
She's like, I like nuclear weapons.

4590
03:11:13,340 --> 03:11:14,820
We can't allow it to be exploited by nations or their politics.

4591
03:11:15,260 --> 03:11:16,840
Man and nuclear weapons.

4592
03:11:16,840 --> 03:11:17,960
Nuclear weapons cannot coexist.

4593
03:11:18,780 --> 03:11:21,480
Mere mortals were never meant to handle nuclear fusion.

4594
03:11:21,680 --> 03:11:22,060
Science defines me.

4595
03:11:22,060 --> 03:11:23,660
Watching the brother and sister nerd rage.

4596
03:11:23,820 --> 03:11:25,100
My government respects me.

4597
03:11:25,200 --> 03:11:26,420
Can you tell me what's wrong with that?

4598
03:11:26,500 --> 03:11:26,900
Can you?

4599
03:11:27,300 --> 03:11:27,740
Okay.

4600
03:11:28,140 --> 03:11:28,840
That's enough.

4601
03:11:29,100 --> 03:11:29,760
Oh my god.

4602
03:11:30,100 --> 03:11:31,100
Oh my god.

4603
03:11:31,860 --> 03:11:33,420
Well, let's see if there's one more, okay?

4604
03:11:34,180 --> 03:11:35,760
I had a huge crush on Emma.

4605
03:11:35,920 --> 03:11:36,760
I don't blame you.

4606
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:37,280
Snake.

4607
03:11:37,580 --> 03:11:38,640
Let me talk to him.

4608
03:11:39,040 --> 03:11:40,380
Oh, yeah.

4609
03:11:41,280 --> 03:11:42,540
Otacon's busy right now.

4610
03:11:42,680 --> 03:11:44,060
You'll have to settle for me.

4611
03:11:44,520 --> 03:11:44,880
What?

4612
03:11:45,280 --> 03:11:46,160
Oh, okay.

4613
03:11:46,380 --> 03:11:46,820
I'm sorry.

4614
03:11:47,580 --> 03:11:48,620
Now, what do you want?

4615
03:11:48,960 --> 03:11:49,720
Hal's wrong.

4616
03:11:50,040 --> 03:11:52,260
Science doesn't exist to benefit the world.

4617
03:11:52,680 --> 03:11:53,160
Rage.

4618
03:11:53,180 --> 03:11:53,460
Rage.

4619
03:11:53,460 --> 03:11:54,280
Then what is it for?

4620
03:11:54,860 --> 03:11:55,860
Science is for the individual.

4621
03:11:56,100 --> 03:11:56,580
Nerd rage.

4622
03:11:56,740 --> 03:11:58,360
For me, it's a way to realize my dreams.

4623
03:11:58,460 --> 03:11:59,200
Nerd rage.

4624
03:11:59,400 --> 03:12:00,180
Sounds pretty greedy.

4625
03:12:00,700 --> 03:12:02,340
You can't realize your dreams without greed.

4626
03:12:02,600 --> 03:12:03,840
And what's your dream?

4627
03:12:04,300 --> 03:12:05,700
Take revenge on Hal.

4628
03:12:05,960 --> 03:12:07,540
To beat him in his own game.

4629
03:12:07,960 --> 03:12:08,780
Nerd fight.

4630
03:12:09,240 --> 03:12:11,640
I am going to make him regret the day he left me.

4631
03:12:11,640 --> 03:12:14,620
I am going to make him realize he was wrong.

4632
03:12:15,340 --> 03:12:16,820
Of all the idiots in the world.

4633
03:12:16,820 --> 03:12:17,320
Idiotic.

4634
03:12:17,400 --> 03:12:19,020
I think that's enough.

4635
03:12:19,540 --> 03:12:20,060
Idiotic?

4636
03:12:20,180 --> 03:12:21,140
It's my goal.

4637
03:12:21,180 --> 03:12:22,300
My reason for being alive.

4638
03:12:22,700 --> 03:12:23,640
Hal is wrong.

4639
03:12:23,880 --> 03:12:25,580
He's only being used by his country.

4640
03:12:25,660 --> 03:12:26,240
He's pitiful.

4641
03:12:26,340 --> 03:12:27,680
Even you guys are using him.

4642
03:12:27,760 --> 03:12:28,200
Me?

4643
03:12:28,560 --> 03:12:31,440
I'm using science to achieve my own dream.

4644
03:12:32,320 --> 03:12:33,260
Real bright, lady.

4645
03:12:33,600 --> 03:12:36,880
That's exactly the line that scientists are never meant to cross.

4646
03:12:37,040 --> 03:12:37,560
Oh, my God.

4647
03:12:37,680 --> 03:12:37,900
Right.

4648
03:12:37,900 --> 03:12:39,380
I sold my soul for revenge.

4649
03:12:39,460 --> 03:12:40,620
I will never forgive him.

4650
03:12:40,780 --> 03:12:41,080
Yeah.

4651
03:12:41,180 --> 03:12:43,340
Don't pretend this conversation never happened.

4652
03:12:43,680 --> 03:12:44,200
No.

4653
03:12:44,260 --> 03:12:46,560
You tell my brother exactly what I said.

4654
03:12:46,660 --> 03:12:46,800
I'm sorry.

4655
03:12:46,820 --> 03:12:47,220
Emma.

4656
03:12:47,760 --> 03:12:48,280
What?

4657
03:12:48,720 --> 03:12:50,220
You're speaking your mind.

4658
03:12:50,260 --> 03:12:51,280
Not your heart.

4659
03:12:51,540 --> 03:12:52,060
Whoa.

4660
03:12:52,500 --> 03:12:53,620
Just leave it at that.

4661
03:12:54,760 --> 03:12:55,280
Okay.

4662
03:12:58,080 --> 03:12:58,600
Oh.

4663
03:12:59,380 --> 03:12:59,900
Awkward.

4664
03:13:01,380 --> 03:13:02,760
Should I check one more time?

4665
03:13:03,460 --> 03:13:05,720
It's so entertaining to listen to them go off.

4666
03:13:05,980 --> 03:13:09,800
The rumors about Big Shell being a big cover up are all true.

4667
03:13:10,120 --> 03:13:11,160
It seems like E.E.

4668
03:13:11,160 --> 03:13:12,040
just took a leap.

4669
03:13:12,080 --> 03:13:13,000
Huge leap here.

4670
03:13:13,180 --> 03:13:13,380
Sure.

4671
03:13:13,400 --> 03:13:15,280
There are some facilities to clean up the pollution.

4672
03:13:15,440 --> 03:13:16,800
But they're not running at full capacity.

4673
03:13:16,800 --> 03:13:24,220
Don't you think it's funny that even though two years have gone by since the incident, they haven't managed to clean up all the crude oil?

4674
03:13:24,440 --> 03:13:27,140
Of course, the media doesn't report that kind of thing.

4675
03:13:27,540 --> 03:13:32,560
I think they're having fresh shipments of crude oil brought in to replace the stuff they've cleaned up.

4676
03:13:32,720 --> 03:13:32,860
Ah.

4677
03:13:33,140 --> 03:13:38,000
The story you were told about toxic chemicals being released if the plant were blown up also seems pretty fishy.

4678
03:13:38,220 --> 03:13:39,900
I don't think it's actually true.

4679
03:13:40,720 --> 03:13:43,200
Information is being suppressed on a huge scale.

4680
03:13:43,440 --> 03:13:43,680
Super Step Sister Method?

4681
03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:44,020
Get me out!

4682
03:13:44,020 --> 03:13:46,780
You guys seem to think that the new Metal Gear is worth all the money.

4683
03:13:46,780 --> 03:13:48,460
I mean, all the effort and money they're spending on it.

4684
03:13:48,660 --> 03:13:51,140
So I've been lied to all along.

4685
03:13:51,460 --> 03:13:51,960
Yeah, man.

4686
03:13:52,060 --> 03:13:52,300
No.

4687
03:13:52,540 --> 03:13:55,240
I think even your CO didn't know what was going on.

4688
03:13:55,400 --> 03:13:57,560
And that's probably what he's been telling you.

4689
03:13:57,780 --> 03:13:59,520
I didn't mean by the Colonel.

4690
03:13:59,960 --> 03:14:01,240
I meant by you.

4691
03:14:01,820 --> 03:14:02,300
Huh?

4692
03:14:02,820 --> 03:14:04,240
We never lied to you.

4693
03:14:04,420 --> 03:14:06,460
We just didn't tell you everything.

4694
03:14:06,660 --> 03:14:07,100
That's all.

4695
03:14:07,980 --> 03:14:09,100
Lying by omission!

4696
03:14:09,700 --> 03:14:11,880
You know, you're a pretty interesting guy.

4697
03:14:12,420 --> 03:14:13,900
You're just like Snake said.

4698
03:14:14,180 --> 03:14:15,140
What did he say?

4699
03:14:15,300 --> 03:14:16,760
That you're a weak, simple, and ungrateful person.

4700
03:14:16,760 --> 03:14:17,860
You're a simple -minded, stubborn fool.

4701
03:14:19,020 --> 03:14:21,480
A weak, simple-minded...

4702
03:14:21,480 --> 03:14:22,460
Oh, don't worry.

4703
03:14:22,580 --> 03:14:23,900
He didn't mean anything bad by it.

4704
03:14:23,900 --> 03:14:25,000
Nothing bad?

4705
03:14:25,460 --> 03:14:27,640
Well, what could possibly be worse than that?

4706
03:14:27,740 --> 03:14:31,800
That lying, useless, backstabbing, mincing son of a...

4707
03:14:31,800 --> 03:14:33,320
Raiden, I'm his friend.

4708
03:14:33,400 --> 03:14:35,060
I know him better than anyone else.

4709
03:14:35,160 --> 03:14:36,060
I know he's not that kind of guy.

4710
03:14:36,060 --> 03:14:36,500
He's raging!

4711
03:14:37,080 --> 03:14:37,320
Yeah?

4712
03:14:37,440 --> 03:14:38,380
So what?

4713
03:14:38,780 --> 03:14:43,000
And, uh, by the way, there's one more thing you should probably know about Snake.

4714
03:14:43,200 --> 03:14:43,620
What?

4715
03:14:43,620 --> 03:14:44,060
He's bisexual.

4716
03:14:44,480 --> 03:14:45,340
He's right here.

4717
03:14:45,520 --> 03:14:45,800
Ah!

4718
03:14:46,220 --> 03:14:46,700
Neck.

4719
03:14:46,700 --> 03:14:46,740
Neck.

4720
03:14:46,740 --> 03:14:47,040
And he's not even close to you?

4721
03:14:47,300 --> 03:14:47,700
Yep.

4722
03:14:48,500 --> 03:14:50,700
Did he hear... every word?

4723
03:14:52,940 --> 03:14:53,340
I'm...

4724
03:14:54,680 --> 03:14:56,620
I'm just going to get back to the mission now.

4725
03:15:03,460 --> 03:15:03,860
Oopsie!

4726
03:15:15,900 --> 03:15:16,660
Oh my gosh!

4727
03:15:16,940 --> 03:15:18,600
I thought that was a mine!

4728
03:15:19,800 --> 03:15:22,220
Oh my god, I thought that was a mine!

4729
03:15:22,360 --> 03:15:24,080
Oh my gosh, I was so scared for a second.

4730
03:15:24,280 --> 03:15:26,620
My whole body flinched.

4731
03:15:26,980 --> 03:15:27,900
Oh gosh!

4732
03:15:29,460 --> 03:15:29,860
Oh!

4733
03:15:29,860 --> 03:15:29,860
Ah!

4734
03:15:30,560 --> 03:15:32,420
Oh my gosh, I thought it was a mine.

4735
03:15:33,640 --> 03:15:34,640
Cheese, Louise.

4736
03:15:36,280 --> 03:15:39,520
Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese.

4737
03:15:41,580 --> 03:15:42,860
Oh my gosh, okay.

4738
03:15:45,160 --> 03:15:45,860
This way.

4739
03:15:48,960 --> 03:15:50,380
Down, down, down.

4740
03:15:51,060 --> 03:15:52,280
By the river.

4741
03:15:54,980 --> 03:15:56,960
There are no mines in this room though, right?

4742
03:15:59,040 --> 03:16:00,140
Close your eyes.

4743
03:16:01,100 --> 03:16:01,980
Close your eyes.

4744
03:16:02,040 --> 03:16:04,980
I'm sorry, I'm bad at direction.

4745
03:16:05,340 --> 03:16:06,180
Close your eyes.

4746
03:16:07,680 --> 03:16:08,160
Okay.

4747
03:16:08,920 --> 03:16:09,620
Okay, okay.

4748
03:16:10,260 --> 03:16:11,440
Who the heck is Louise?

4749
03:16:12,600 --> 03:16:16,060
My favorite part of this game so far is how many small details there are.

4750
03:16:16,220 --> 03:16:18,900
So many interactions and conversations I didn't see when I played it.

4751
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:19,580
I know, right?

4752
03:16:20,320 --> 03:16:21,340
They're so fun.

4753
03:16:23,240 --> 03:16:23,720
Snake!

4754
03:16:26,960 --> 03:16:27,800
You've got rations.

4755
03:16:28,500 --> 03:16:30,400
Okay, I think I'm good.

4756
03:16:33,560 --> 03:16:34,320
What is it?

4757
03:16:34,360 --> 03:16:36,420
Oh, I prefer rations over Rose's home cooking.

4758
03:16:38,280 --> 03:16:39,320
Not bad, huh?

4759
03:16:39,440 --> 03:16:42,420
Sorry, I thought that maybe I would get something while looking at him.

4760
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:44,260
While zooming in on him.

4761
03:16:46,660 --> 03:16:48,660
He looks pretty bad shape, not gonna lie.

4762
03:16:50,440 --> 03:16:52,420
Sorry, I didn't mean to like skip the cutscene.

4763
03:16:53,800 --> 03:16:54,180
Okay.

4764
03:16:55,200 --> 03:16:57,020
Alright, there's bombs down here.

4765
03:16:57,740 --> 03:16:58,540
There's bombs.

4766
03:16:59,500 --> 03:17:00,920
There's bombs, I saw them.

4767
03:17:03,380 --> 03:17:03,780
Okay.

4768
03:17:04,340 --> 03:17:04,740
Okay.

4769
03:17:05,620 --> 03:17:06,840
They replaced him, maybe.

4770
03:17:08,800 --> 03:17:09,200
Rush.

4771
03:17:11,220 --> 03:17:11,940
Hold on.

4772
03:17:12,200 --> 03:17:12,600
Wait.

4773
03:17:13,520 --> 03:17:13,920
Wait.

4774
03:17:13,960 --> 03:17:15,060
Oh gosh, I'm going the wrong way.

4775
03:17:15,620 --> 03:17:16,240
Wait, wait, wait.

4776
03:17:16,520 --> 03:17:17,560
Wait, was that something there?

4777
03:17:18,380 --> 03:17:18,900
Oh god.

4778
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:19,320
Oh god.

4779
03:17:19,640 --> 03:17:20,760
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.

4780
03:17:32,500 --> 03:17:33,500
Sorry, I'm...

4781
03:17:33,500 --> 03:17:34,440
Oh my gosh.

4782
03:17:34,760 --> 03:17:36,020
But there's a rash in there.

4783
03:17:37,620 --> 03:17:38,860
I have to go that way anyway.

4784
03:17:40,700 --> 03:17:41,100
Okay.

4785
03:17:41,460 --> 03:17:41,860
Okay.

4786
03:17:43,780 --> 03:17:44,740
Oak, you're solid too.

4787
03:17:44,820 --> 03:17:46,500
Raiden, please dump your girlfriend already.

4788
03:17:46,860 --> 03:17:47,260
No!

4789
03:17:47,700 --> 03:17:48,620
Stay with her forever.

4790
03:17:50,940 --> 03:17:51,980
I love the excitement.

4791
03:18:01,820 --> 03:18:02,400
Oh my god.

4792
03:18:02,480 --> 03:18:03,300
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4793
03:18:03,640 --> 03:18:04,400
Just go this way.

4794
03:18:05,580 --> 03:18:06,460
Oh my god, Emma!

4795
03:18:06,800 --> 03:18:07,200
Emma!

4796
03:18:11,400 --> 03:18:12,780
That was crazy, wasn't it?

4797
03:18:14,060 --> 03:18:15,260
That was wild.

4798
03:18:15,260 --> 03:18:16,180
Wasn't it?

4799
03:18:16,500 --> 03:18:17,100
Woohoo!

4800
03:18:17,460 --> 03:18:18,060
Yeah.

4801
03:18:18,700 --> 03:18:19,880
Look at the water.

4802
03:18:19,960 --> 03:18:20,520
It's disgusting.

4803
03:18:21,320 --> 03:18:22,320
Why is it...

4804
03:18:22,920 --> 03:18:24,540
Why is the water making noise?

4805
03:18:26,220 --> 03:18:26,820
Eww.

4806
03:18:28,840 --> 03:18:29,800
Okay, here we go.

4807
03:18:30,660 --> 03:18:31,900
She'll be fine.

4808
03:18:32,140 --> 03:18:32,580
She'll...

4809
03:18:41,940 --> 03:18:42,800
She's fine.

4810
03:18:49,810 --> 03:18:50,410
Okay.

4811
03:18:51,070 --> 03:18:51,670
Alrighty.

4812
03:18:52,270 --> 03:18:52,870
Okay.

4813
03:18:52,870 --> 03:18:53,350
We're here.

4814
03:18:54,030 --> 03:18:55,070
We're here.

4815
03:18:55,490 --> 03:18:55,910
We're here.

4816
03:18:55,910 --> 03:18:56,450
Don't worry.

4817
03:18:56,690 --> 03:18:56,870
See?

4818
03:18:57,570 --> 03:18:59,310
And no bugs inside.

4819
03:19:00,850 --> 03:19:01,830
No bugs.

4820
03:19:09,410 --> 03:19:10,110
Shoo!

4821
03:19:10,110 --> 03:19:10,690
Shoo!

4822
03:19:11,030 --> 03:19:11,730
Shoo!

4823
03:19:11,870 --> 03:19:12,390
Shoo!

4824
03:19:12,970 --> 03:19:13,670
Shoo!

4825
03:19:14,610 --> 03:19:15,090
Shoo!

4826
03:19:15,090 --> 03:19:15,390
Shoo!

4827
03:19:15,390 --> 03:19:15,610
Shoo!

4828
03:19:16,430 --> 03:19:17,310
Come on, Emma.

4829
03:19:17,970 --> 03:19:18,570
It's okay.

4830
03:19:21,870 --> 03:19:22,350
Bugs?

4831
03:19:22,530 --> 03:19:23,810
I hate bugs!

4832
03:19:24,130 --> 03:19:25,030
I hate bugs!

4833
03:19:25,530 --> 03:19:25,990
Come on, come on.

4834
03:19:26,150 --> 03:19:27,730
You look so sad.

4835
03:19:27,870 --> 03:19:28,270
Come on.

4836
03:19:28,610 --> 03:19:29,090
Bugs!

4837
03:19:29,390 --> 03:19:30,530
I hate bugs!

4838
03:19:31,430 --> 03:19:31,910
Bugs!

4839
03:19:31,910 --> 03:19:34,490
Freeze them.

4840
03:19:34,610 --> 03:19:36,010
I'll freeze them for you, girly.

4841
03:19:46,600 --> 03:19:47,080
Yeah.

4842
03:19:48,620 --> 03:19:49,680
Just a little bit more.

4843
03:19:50,500 --> 03:19:51,640
Where'd they come from?

4844
03:19:52,200 --> 03:19:52,680
Nasty.

4845
03:19:52,920 --> 03:19:53,400
Oh.

4846
03:19:53,720 --> 03:19:53,880
Oh.

4847
03:19:53,880 --> 03:19:54,540
Bugs!

4848
03:19:54,760 --> 03:19:56,440
I hate bugs!

4849
03:19:59,440 --> 03:19:59,960
Yeah.

4850
03:19:59,980 --> 03:20:00,340
Me too.

4851
03:20:00,860 --> 03:20:02,100
Especially pink ones.

4852
03:20:09,700 --> 03:20:10,220
Oh.

4853
03:20:10,320 --> 03:20:11,940
This does a really great job.

4854
03:20:12,320 --> 03:20:14,520
This is every exterminator's dream.

4855
03:20:18,280 --> 03:20:19,000
Okay, Emma.

4856
03:20:19,060 --> 03:20:20,100
Don't look so sad.

4857
03:20:20,180 --> 03:20:20,660
My goodness.

4858
03:20:25,580 --> 03:20:26,100
Oh.

4859
03:20:26,120 --> 03:20:26,460
Oh.

4860
03:20:31,790 --> 03:20:32,310
Oh.

4861
03:20:32,370 --> 03:20:33,330
They're hidden in there.

4862
03:20:33,410 --> 03:20:33,910
Let's just go.

4863
03:20:34,030 --> 03:20:34,750
Let's just go.

4864
03:20:34,830 --> 03:20:35,130
Come on.

4865
03:20:38,490 --> 03:20:39,670
Mata in shambles?

4866
03:20:39,710 --> 03:20:39,930
Good.

4867
03:20:43,590 --> 03:20:45,870
Trank her and carry her over the bugs.

4868
03:20:48,450 --> 03:20:49,750
Maybe we could do that.

4869
03:20:51,770 --> 03:20:52,430
Oh, God.

4870
03:20:52,470 --> 03:20:52,870
You guys.

4871
03:20:55,170 --> 03:20:55,930
Oh, God.

4872
03:20:55,970 --> 03:20:56,470
You guys.

4873
03:20:56,610 --> 03:20:58,130
Oh, my stomach's starting to hurt.

4874
03:21:07,490 --> 03:21:07,930
No.

4875
03:21:07,950 --> 03:21:08,390
No.

4876
03:21:08,530 --> 03:21:08,970
No.

4877
03:21:10,410 --> 03:21:10,850
No.

4878
03:21:10,870 --> 03:21:10,950
No.

4879
03:21:11,070 --> 03:21:11,350
No.

4880
03:21:11,450 --> 03:21:11,710
No.

4881
03:21:11,870 --> 03:21:12,190
No.

4882
03:21:13,250 --> 03:21:13,610
No.

4883
03:21:13,610 --> 03:21:13,910
No.

4884
03:21:13,910 --> 03:21:14,150
No.

4885
03:21:14,610 --> 03:21:16,330
My tummy's starting to hurt at this part.

4886
03:21:16,950 --> 03:21:19,810
You guys, I have a bit of a trauma here in this area.

4887
03:21:22,010 --> 03:21:25,110
If you know, you know.

4888
03:21:25,950 --> 03:21:28,250
But I have a bit of a trauma in this area.

4889
03:21:29,190 --> 03:21:29,790
Oh, God.

4890
03:21:29,830 --> 03:21:30,270
Oh, God.

4891
03:21:30,270 --> 03:21:30,590
Oh, God.

4892
03:21:30,590 --> 03:21:30,930
Oh, God.

4893
03:21:31,290 --> 03:21:31,970
Oh, God.

4894
03:21:31,970 --> 03:21:31,990
Oh, God.

4895
03:21:32,010 --> 03:21:32,130
Oh, God.

4896
03:21:37,210 --> 03:21:37,770
Oh, God.

4897
03:21:38,190 --> 03:21:38,910
Oh, God.

4898
03:21:53,480 --> 03:21:54,000
Oh, God.

4899
03:21:54,120 --> 03:21:54,160
Oh, God.

4900
03:21:55,800 --> 03:21:58,300
Did he disappear out of existence?

4901
03:21:58,540 --> 03:21:58,640
Oh.

4902
03:22:01,180 --> 03:22:02,040
What is he doing?

4903
03:22:02,540 --> 03:22:03,160
Oh, my gosh.

4904
03:22:03,900 --> 03:22:04,300
Okay.

4905
03:22:06,500 --> 03:22:07,620
I'm gonna take her this way.

4906
03:22:09,180 --> 03:22:10,160
I'm gonna have her hide.

4907
03:22:11,480 --> 03:22:12,220
Oh, my gosh.

4908
03:22:12,360 --> 03:22:12,940
Oh, God.

4909
03:22:15,220 --> 03:22:16,020
Oh, God.

4910
03:22:16,020 --> 03:22:16,580
Oh, God.

4911
03:22:16,600 --> 03:22:17,080
Oh, God.

4912
03:22:17,080 --> 03:22:22,020
I don't think you guys understand the emotions I'm feeling right now.

4913
03:22:22,760 --> 03:22:23,540
Oh, God.

4914
03:22:24,360 --> 03:22:24,940
Oh, God.

4915
03:22:24,940 --> 03:22:25,400
Oh, God.

4916
03:22:25,420 --> 03:22:25,780
Oh, God.

4917
03:22:25,800 --> 03:22:26,200
Oh, my, gosh.

4918
03:22:26,260 --> 03:22:26,300
Oh, God.

4919
03:22:26,740 --> 03:22:27,100
Oh, my gosh.

4920
03:22:27,820 --> 03:22:28,460
Oh, God.

4921
03:22:31,220 --> 03:22:31,580
Oh, God.

4922
03:22:31,880 --> 03:22:32,240
Oh, God.

4923
03:22:32,240 --> 03:22:32,500
Oh, God.

4924
03:22:32,680 --> 03:22:32,780
Oh, gosh.

4925
03:22:32,780 --> 03:22:33,140
You guys...

4926
03:22:53,860 --> 03:22:55,020
What happens here.

4927
03:22:55,800 --> 03:22:56,420
Oh, shoot.

4928
03:22:56,500 --> 03:22:57,100
Oh, my gosh.

4929
03:22:58,020 --> 03:22:59,060
There's somebody there.

4930
03:22:59,180 --> 03:22:59,420
No.

4931
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:15,780
Just the bugs.

4932
03:23:19,040 --> 03:23:21,610
No, no, no, no.

4933
03:23:21,630 --> 03:23:21,790
Go.

4934
03:23:21,790 --> 03:23:25,390
Oh my god,

4935
03:23:38,970 --> 03:23:39,270
my cat!

4936
03:23:39,490 --> 03:23:39,890
Oh my god!

4937
03:23:40,090 --> 03:23:40,770
Wait, Pies!

4938
03:23:41,030 --> 03:23:41,670
Pies, stop!

4939
03:23:41,730 --> 03:23:42,710
Stop climbing my chair!

4940
03:23:43,550 --> 03:23:44,850
Okay, I'll let you out, hold on!

4941
03:23:45,390 --> 03:23:46,390
Pies, please, Pies.

4942
03:23:46,830 --> 03:23:47,690
Pies, Pies, Pies.

4943
03:23:50,070 --> 03:23:50,570
Pies, please.

4944
03:23:55,390 --> 03:23:56,610
Oh my god, hold on.

4945
03:23:56,710 --> 03:23:57,790
I gotta let my cat out of my room.

4946
03:23:58,130 --> 03:23:58,730
Pies, I'm sorry!

4947
03:23:58,830 --> 03:24:00,170
Okay, just one second.

4948
03:24:24,660 --> 03:24:25,300
Okay, okay, okay.

4949
03:24:25,840 --> 03:24:27,220
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

4950
03:24:27,940 --> 03:24:29,220
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

4951
03:24:29,580 --> 03:24:30,940
I'm wondering if I should just kill him.

4952
03:24:38,010 --> 03:24:38,730
Sorry, buddy.

4953
03:24:41,150 --> 03:24:41,870
Oh, wow.

4954
03:24:42,350 --> 03:24:43,170
You're a tough guy.

4955
03:24:46,590 --> 03:24:46,950
How?

4956
03:24:49,390 --> 03:24:50,130
Okay, there we go.

4957
03:24:50,630 --> 03:24:50,990
Okay.

4958
03:24:51,530 --> 03:24:52,030
Don't worry!

4959
03:24:52,310 --> 03:24:54,350
I'm gonna handle this room first!

4960
03:24:55,250 --> 03:24:55,610
Emma!

4961
03:24:56,890 --> 03:24:58,510
You guys, I can't have him waking up, okay?

4962
03:25:01,410 --> 03:25:02,890
It's too scary here, okay?

4963
03:25:03,210 --> 03:25:03,930
You have to...

4964
03:25:04,990 --> 03:25:05,430
Understand!

4965
03:25:05,770 --> 03:25:06,210
Please understand!

4966
03:25:14,890 --> 03:25:16,110
Doesn't he come out of...

4967
03:25:17,190 --> 03:25:19,070
That hallway on the right?

4968
03:25:24,080 --> 03:25:25,500
Okay, let's just go get Emma.

4969
03:25:30,030 --> 03:25:30,590
Come on.

4970
03:25:33,730 --> 03:25:34,330
Come on.

4971
03:25:34,530 --> 03:25:35,050
Let's go.

4972
03:25:35,610 --> 03:25:36,230
Come on.

4973
03:25:36,330 --> 03:25:37,810
Well, you can wait in the...

4974
03:25:37,810 --> 03:25:40,150
You can wait in the waiting room... in the...

4975
03:25:40,850 --> 03:25:41,450
In the...

4976
03:25:42,610 --> 03:25:43,570
In the lounge.

4977
03:25:44,490 --> 03:25:45,750
Here, you're in the break room.

4978
03:25:46,530 --> 03:25:47,090
There you go.

4979
03:25:47,150 --> 03:25:47,610
Take a...

4980
03:25:47,610 --> 03:25:48,370
Actually, there...

4981
03:25:48,370 --> 03:25:49,990
Oh, I was gonna say, there's no couches in...

4982
03:25:49,990 --> 03:25:50,590
There he is.

4983
03:25:51,490 --> 03:25:52,150
There he is.

4984
03:25:52,170 --> 03:25:52,530
There he is.

4985
03:26:01,190 --> 03:26:01,990
What's his route?

4986
03:26:02,090 --> 03:26:03,050
Let's see what he does.

4987
03:26:05,630 --> 03:26:06,810
Get her a cola, too.

4988
03:26:07,730 --> 03:26:08,990
Now, does he look up?

4989
03:26:09,430 --> 03:26:11,670
Because if not, I can just stand and...

4990
03:26:11,670 --> 03:26:12,250
You know...

4991
03:26:12,250 --> 03:26:13,270
And grab him.

4992
03:26:13,570 --> 03:26:14,590
Which way does he turn?

4993
03:26:14,850 --> 03:26:15,090
Oh...

4994
03:26:15,090 --> 03:26:15,590
Oh...

4995
03:26:15,590 --> 03:26:15,830
Oh...

4996
03:26:17,030 --> 03:26:20,130
Okay, we can just stand over here and wait for him.

4997
03:26:21,930 --> 03:26:22,370
Perfect.

4998
03:26:33,720 --> 03:26:34,600
I'm feeling...

4999
03:26:35,080 --> 03:26:36,280
Oh, God, I'm...

5000
03:26:36,280 --> 03:26:38,240
I'm feeling it, Mr. Krabs.

5001
03:26:38,240 --> 03:26:40,040
I'm feeling it, Mr. Krabs.

5002
03:26:40,500 --> 03:26:42,020
I'm feeling it, Mr. Krabs.

5003
03:26:52,880 --> 03:26:53,480
I'm sorry.

5004
03:26:53,680 --> 03:26:54,800
I'm really sorry, man.

5005
03:26:57,380 --> 03:26:58,740
Is there something else here?

5006
03:26:58,860 --> 03:26:58,980
Oh.

5007
03:27:00,560 --> 03:27:02,040
This is for my own good.

5008
03:27:02,320 --> 03:27:03,060
This is for...

5009
03:27:03,060 --> 03:27:03,760
This is for me.

5010
03:27:04,100 --> 03:27:04,460
Sorry.

5011
03:27:04,580 --> 03:27:05,500
I have to do it.

5012
03:27:05,740 --> 03:27:06,840
I have to do it to you.

5013
03:27:07,460 --> 03:27:08,020
I have...

5014
03:27:08,020 --> 03:27:08,540
I have to...

5015
03:27:08,540 --> 03:27:08,900
I have...

5016
03:27:08,900 --> 03:27:10,060
You guys, it's for my own...

5017
03:27:10,060 --> 03:27:10,480
Please.

5018
03:27:14,600 --> 03:27:17,140
It's for my own well-being.

5019
03:27:20,700 --> 03:27:23,300
This is the part I've been dreading the entire game.

5020
03:27:25,440 --> 03:27:26,160
Please understand.

5021
03:27:26,760 --> 03:27:27,520
All right, come on.

5022
03:27:28,480 --> 03:27:29,480
Yeah, Emma, don't look.

5023
03:27:29,540 --> 03:27:29,980
Close your eyes.

5024
03:27:30,240 --> 03:27:31,100
Close your eyes, okay?

5025
03:27:31,220 --> 03:27:31,700
Come on.

5026
03:27:32,420 --> 03:27:34,220
I'm gonna put you in that hallway, okay?

5027
03:27:35,120 --> 03:27:35,480
Yeah.

5028
03:27:40,600 --> 03:27:41,580
I'm gonna put you in here.

5029
03:27:41,760 --> 03:27:42,440
Don't look at the blood.

5030
03:27:42,760 --> 03:27:43,320
It's fine.

5031
03:27:44,240 --> 03:27:45,160
Don't look at it.

5032
03:27:45,440 --> 03:27:46,400
Don't even notice it.

5033
03:27:59,390 --> 03:27:59,850
That's me.

5034
03:28:00,050 --> 03:28:00,610
This is...

5035
03:28:00,610 --> 03:28:01,370
This is me, right?

5036
03:28:04,510 --> 03:28:05,230
I'm tired.

5037
03:28:06,350 --> 03:28:06,950
I'm tired.

5038
03:28:08,050 --> 03:28:08,410
Okay.

5039
03:28:08,450 --> 03:28:08,670
Okay.

5040
03:28:08,710 --> 03:28:08,890
Okay.

5041
03:28:09,470 --> 03:28:10,370
Can I just leave?

5042
03:28:10,730 --> 03:28:11,090
Okay.

5043
03:28:12,190 --> 03:28:12,710
Okay.

5044
03:28:13,530 --> 03:28:14,570
All right.

5045
03:28:15,750 --> 03:28:19,330
I know I seemed dramatic right now but I don't...

5046
03:28:19,330 --> 03:28:20,510
I don't know if you understand.

5047
03:28:21,130 --> 03:28:22,290
I don't know if you can...

5048
03:28:22,290 --> 03:28:23,230
If you might under...

5049
03:28:23,230 --> 03:28:24,770
I don't know what to do.

5050
03:28:25,650 --> 03:28:26,430
Turn around.

5051
03:28:29,170 --> 03:28:29,930
Turn around.

5052
03:28:38,440 --> 03:28:45,520
Can't I peek up over ledges?

5053
03:28:46,480 --> 03:28:48,000
Can't I peek up over ledges?

5054
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:48,320
How do I peek up over ledges?

5055
03:28:48,600 --> 03:28:49,960
I can't remember.

5056
03:28:51,760 --> 03:28:53,080
It doesn't mean fall!

5057
03:28:53,860 --> 03:28:55,160
Oh my god, that was close.

5058
03:28:56,560 --> 03:28:58,380
How do I peek up over ledges?

5059
03:29:05,350 --> 03:29:07,050
L2, R2, and first person.

5060
03:29:07,190 --> 03:29:07,410
Okay.

5061
03:29:08,850 --> 03:29:09,330
Emma.

5062
03:29:51,440 --> 03:29:51,920
Emma.

5063
03:29:54,060 --> 03:29:54,960
Emma, it's over.

5064
03:29:55,340 --> 03:29:57,160
Emma, it's over for us.

5065
03:29:57,200 --> 03:29:57,440
Emma.

5066
03:29:58,060 --> 03:29:59,380
Emma, it's over for us.

5067
03:29:59,800 --> 03:30:00,200
Emma.

5068
03:30:03,800 --> 03:30:06,300
What are they going to do to her actually?

5069
03:30:06,400 --> 03:30:06,760
I'm curious.

5070
03:30:08,820 --> 03:30:09,220
So

5071
03:30:15,200 --> 03:30:17,460
anyway, I started blasting!

5072
03:30:20,460 --> 03:30:21,960
Oh shoot, where did you come from?

5073
03:30:22,720 --> 03:30:23,120
Emma.

5074
03:30:23,580 --> 03:30:24,920
Emma, we can't leave this place.

5075
03:30:25,220 --> 03:30:25,500
Emma.

5076
03:30:25,560 --> 03:30:26,500
Emma, we're in trouble.

5077
03:30:26,920 --> 03:30:27,860
Emma, we're in trouble.

5078
03:30:28,220 --> 03:30:28,620
Emma.

5079
03:30:29,080 --> 03:30:29,720
We're in trouble.

5080
03:30:29,740 --> 03:30:30,280
Emma.

5081
03:30:30,660 --> 03:30:31,600
Emma, we're in trouble.

5082
03:30:31,880 --> 03:30:32,320
Emma.

5083
03:30:32,660 --> 03:30:33,100
Emma.

5084
03:30:33,180 --> 03:30:34,740
This is a bad run, Emma!

5085
03:30:35,080 --> 03:30:35,520
Emma!

5086
03:30:35,640 --> 03:30:36,920
The run is over, Emma!

5087
03:31:03,610 --> 03:31:05,230
Jack, please answer me!

5088
03:31:05,430 --> 03:31:05,870
Jack!

5089
03:31:06,250 --> 03:31:10,070
Oh gosh, you can actually kill so many guards, they stop coming?

5090
03:31:10,210 --> 03:31:10,930
I don't believe that.

5091
03:31:11,030 --> 03:31:12,370
I don't believe that to be true at all.

5092
03:31:22,220 --> 03:31:22,840
You okay?

5093
03:31:24,400 --> 03:31:27,320
That was all just a bad, bad dream.

5094
03:31:29,960 --> 03:31:31,260
That actually went...

5095
03:31:31,860 --> 03:31:35,440
Um, worse than how I first have done it.

5096
03:31:41,830 --> 03:31:44,070
That was actually worse than before.

5097
03:31:45,030 --> 03:31:46,090
That's so funny.

5098
03:31:47,050 --> 03:31:48,250
Funny how that is.

5099
03:31:49,250 --> 03:31:49,810
Funny.

5100
03:31:52,490 --> 03:31:53,610
That bastard.

5101
03:31:58,660 --> 03:31:59,340
Oh god.

5102
03:31:59,560 --> 03:31:59,940
Oh!

5103
03:32:00,320 --> 03:32:02,400
Wait, he didn't notice that, did he?

5104
03:32:02,960 --> 03:32:04,660
Nah, he was too busy sleeping.

5105
03:32:05,520 --> 03:32:07,080
He was busy being a sleepy guy.

5106
03:32:07,460 --> 03:32:07,920
Come on.

5107
03:32:09,420 --> 03:32:10,140
Oh, hello?

5108
03:32:10,320 --> 03:32:10,920
Come on, girl.

5109
03:32:11,180 --> 03:32:11,920
We gotta run.

5110
03:32:13,760 --> 03:32:14,440
We gotta go.

5111
03:32:14,580 --> 03:32:15,840
I'm gonna put you over here again.

5112
03:32:15,960 --> 03:32:16,440
Don't worry.

5113
03:32:17,100 --> 03:32:18,120
I'm gonna put you over here.

5114
03:32:18,600 --> 03:32:18,960
Yeah.

5115
03:32:19,540 --> 03:32:21,940
And I'm also gonna put both bodies over here too.

5116
03:32:25,800 --> 03:32:27,740
I'm gonna put both bodies over here too.

5117
03:32:29,480 --> 03:32:29,840
Oh

5118
03:32:34,850 --> 03:32:34,970
no!

5119
03:32:35,050 --> 03:32:35,890
Wait, that was my...

5120
03:32:35,890 --> 03:32:36,450
Wait, wait, wait!

5121
03:32:36,590 --> 03:32:37,610
Wait, wait, wait!

5122
03:32:37,930 --> 03:32:38,430
Wait, wait!

5123
03:32:38,430 --> 03:32:39,550
Oh my god, wait!

5124
03:32:39,810 --> 03:32:40,210
Open!

5125
03:33:01,690 --> 03:33:02,510
Now fall asleep.

5126
03:33:02,770 --> 03:33:03,190
There we go.

5127
03:33:03,610 --> 03:33:04,010
Okay.

5128
03:33:05,650 --> 03:33:07,010
Um, let's get his butt.

5129
03:33:08,290 --> 03:33:08,690
Okay.

5130
03:33:09,430 --> 03:33:09,830
Alright!

5131
03:33:10,330 --> 03:33:10,890
You come here.

5132
03:33:11,450 --> 03:33:12,310
Come here, come here.

5133
03:33:12,930 --> 03:33:13,810
Come here, come...

5134
03:33:13,810 --> 03:33:13,970
Oh.

5135
03:33:14,570 --> 03:33:15,470
Come here, come here.

5136
03:33:16,250 --> 03:33:17,270
Come on, come on.

5137
03:33:17,950 --> 03:33:18,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5138
03:33:19,570 --> 03:33:19,970
Okay.

5139
03:33:22,330 --> 03:33:23,630
Eternal sleep for you.

5140
03:33:26,270 --> 03:33:28,330
Nice eternal slumber...

5141
03:33:29,050 --> 03:33:29,970
for you.

5142
03:33:31,350 --> 03:33:32,250
Emma, don't look.

5143
03:33:32,390 --> 03:33:33,310
Close your ears.

5144
03:33:35,570 --> 03:33:36,090
Hey!

5145
03:33:36,570 --> 03:33:37,090
Um...

5146
03:33:37,090 --> 03:33:38,750
Give me something before you go.

5147
03:33:42,330 --> 03:33:42,850
Really?

5148
03:33:49,300 --> 03:33:49,820
Cheap.

5149
03:33:50,160 --> 03:33:50,680
Cheap.

5150
03:33:54,410 --> 03:33:55,450
This guy...

5151
03:33:57,630 --> 03:33:58,370
There we go.

5152
03:33:58,490 --> 03:33:58,850
Alright.

5153
03:33:59,450 --> 03:34:00,270
Come on, Emma.

5154
03:34:02,110 --> 03:34:03,490
Yeah, he is stingy.

5155
03:34:04,130 --> 03:34:04,570
Okay.

5156
03:34:05,510 --> 03:34:05,950
Alright.

5157
03:34:06,010 --> 03:34:06,490
One guy...

5158
03:34:06,490 --> 03:34:06,830
You know what?

5159
03:34:06,910 --> 03:34:08,610
Let's actually move him a little bit...

5160
03:34:08,610 --> 03:34:09,070
inward.

5161
03:34:09,310 --> 03:34:10,730
So nobody can see him either.

5162
03:34:11,850 --> 03:34:12,290
Right...

5163
03:34:12,910 --> 03:34:13,350
here.

5164
03:34:14,230 --> 03:34:16,210
Then we'll put your friend right on top of you.

5165
03:34:16,270 --> 03:34:16,530
Come on.

5166
03:34:18,130 --> 03:34:19,050
Isn't this so brutal?

5167
03:34:19,170 --> 03:34:20,270
I don't want them waking up!

5168
03:34:22,130 --> 03:34:23,630
They wake up and they'll be like...

5169
03:34:23,630 --> 03:34:23,770
Oh!

5170
03:34:23,910 --> 03:34:24,330
Oh!

5171
03:34:24,370 --> 03:34:25,650
We got an intruder guy.

5172
03:34:25,930 --> 03:34:26,450
Uh-oh.

5173
03:34:27,050 --> 03:34:27,810
Better I...

5174
03:34:27,810 --> 03:34:28,930
I guess I better...

5175
03:34:28,930 --> 03:34:30,170
attack everything.

5176
03:34:30,170 --> 03:34:30,250
Oh!

5177
03:34:30,250 --> 03:34:33,650
And, you know, call for backup and do everything terrible.

5178
03:34:40,880 --> 03:34:41,400
Okay.

5179
03:34:41,820 --> 03:34:43,200
They won't wake up.

5180
03:34:43,220 --> 03:34:43,620
They do!

5181
03:34:44,800 --> 03:34:45,460
Don't they?

5182
03:34:54,030 --> 03:34:55,330
They'll wake up eventually.

5183
03:35:02,000 --> 03:35:03,300
It takes forever.

5184
03:35:03,520 --> 03:35:03,740
Yeah.

5185
03:35:03,780 --> 03:35:04,860
And I take forever to...

5186
03:35:04,860 --> 03:35:06,700
to get through this part.

5187
03:35:06,880 --> 03:35:07,120
Okay?

5188
03:35:07,200 --> 03:35:07,720
So...

5189
03:35:07,720 --> 03:35:08,920
We're even.

5190
03:35:15,780 --> 03:35:16,380
It's fine.

5191
03:35:21,120 --> 03:35:23,700
Actually, when does this guy come through the elevator?

5192
03:35:26,000 --> 03:35:27,680
Is it timed or...

5193
03:35:37,280 --> 03:35:37,860
Good night.

5194
03:35:40,400 --> 03:35:42,540
This is the only time when murder is okay.

5195
03:35:43,240 --> 03:35:43,640
Okay.

5196
03:36:03,540 --> 03:36:04,320
I'll leave you.

5197
03:36:04,740 --> 03:36:06,360
Well, this is not a safe spot either.

5198
03:36:06,660 --> 03:36:07,080
Hold on.

5199
03:36:07,140 --> 03:36:08,360
Let's wait for the other guy to leave.

5200
03:36:09,660 --> 03:36:11,160
I don't know how much he can see.

5201
03:36:11,740 --> 03:36:12,720
Let's turn around.

5202
03:36:13,000 --> 03:36:14,740
I don't want him to see me walk in front of the stairs.

5203
03:36:14,740 --> 03:36:16,380
He will see me walk in front of the stairs.

5204
03:36:17,880 --> 03:36:20,200
We know you enjoy the killing in this area.

5205
03:36:20,720 --> 03:36:21,480
Yeah, I do.

5206
03:36:21,800 --> 03:36:23,460
And I'm not afraid to admit it.

5207
03:36:23,540 --> 03:36:25,060
I enjoy the killing in this area.

5208
03:36:25,360 --> 03:36:28,000
I will kill for sport.

5209
03:36:30,640 --> 03:36:31,080
Okay.

5210
03:36:31,660 --> 03:36:32,360
Lay down.

5211
03:36:34,440 --> 03:36:35,040
Let's see.

5212
03:36:40,390 --> 03:36:40,830
Wait.

5213
03:36:41,190 --> 03:36:42,230
I think I'm too low.

5214
03:36:43,970 --> 03:36:44,770
I'm too low.

5215
03:37:05,330 --> 03:37:06,630
Wait, maybe if I do this...

5216
03:37:06,630 --> 03:37:08,490
Maybe I can get him from far away.

5217
03:37:13,010 --> 03:37:13,690
There we go.

5218
03:37:22,930 --> 03:37:24,330
I can't see him.

5219
03:37:29,000 --> 03:37:29,840
Oh, he's gone.

5220
03:37:35,770 --> 03:37:36,470
Oh, wait.

5221
03:37:37,430 --> 03:37:37,950
Please,

5222
03:37:43,980 --> 03:37:45,240
put me out of my misery.

5223
03:37:46,100 --> 03:37:47,660
Uh-oh, the misery.

5224
03:37:49,660 --> 03:37:53,500
Oh, my heart is going like a bajillion miles per hour.

5225
03:37:55,640 --> 03:37:57,160
Oh my god, please!

5226
03:37:58,800 --> 03:37:59,860
Where are you?

5227
03:38:00,380 --> 03:38:01,600
Raiden, why are you so short?

5228
03:38:07,870 --> 03:38:08,610
I'm tempted.

5229
03:38:09,630 --> 03:38:10,690
No, it's fine.

5230
03:38:10,830 --> 03:38:11,250
It's fine.

5231
03:38:11,390 --> 03:38:12,270
No, I won't do it.

5232
03:38:12,430 --> 03:38:13,270
I won't do it.

5233
03:38:13,310 --> 03:38:14,210
I'm just gonna steal your stuff.

5234
03:38:18,290 --> 03:38:18,870
Oh, wow.

5235
03:38:19,450 --> 03:38:20,710
Wow, you got the big...

5236
03:38:20,710 --> 03:38:22,190
You got the big guns, okay.

5237
03:38:31,060 --> 03:38:34,140
I don't remember where to do this... how to do...

5238
03:38:35,200 --> 03:38:35,860
Oh gosh.

5239
03:38:36,140 --> 03:38:37,080
I'm too short.

5240
03:38:37,220 --> 03:38:38,320
Oh, I can get him!

5241
03:38:41,140 --> 03:38:42,800
But I think someone will wake him up.

5242
03:38:49,120 --> 03:38:50,340
I think I should've waited.

5243
03:38:50,820 --> 03:38:52,120
I think someone comes around.

5244
03:38:53,540 --> 03:38:55,140
Let me see if someone comes.

5245
03:38:56,220 --> 03:39:00,900
Oh, my hands are so sweaty!

5246
03:39:01,400 --> 03:39:03,280
Oh my god, my hands are so sweaty!

5247
03:39:03,660 --> 03:39:05,180
Oh my god, my hands are so sweaty!

5248
03:39:05,440 --> 03:39:06,420
My hands are so sweaty!

5249
03:39:06,680 --> 03:39:07,780
My hands are so sweaty!

5250
03:39:09,940 --> 03:39:12,820
Oh god, everything is gripping.

5251
03:39:13,060 --> 03:39:14,040
I'm gripping!

5252
03:39:14,740 --> 03:39:16,220
Can you please turn?

5253
03:39:16,520 --> 03:39:17,220
I see...

5254
03:39:19,060 --> 03:39:20,280
Oh, there we go.

5255
03:39:20,340 --> 03:39:20,560
There we go.

5256
03:39:23,660 --> 03:39:24,260
Okay.

5257
03:39:24,380 --> 03:39:24,920
Okay.

5258
03:39:25,040 --> 03:39:25,580
Okay.

5259
03:39:25,620 --> 03:39:26,180
Okay.

5260
03:39:26,180 --> 03:39:26,700
Okay.

5261
03:39:26,740 --> 03:39:26,860
Stop!

5262
03:39:30,620 --> 03:39:31,600
Okay, let's go.

5263
03:39:39,660 --> 03:39:41,100
Lolly, lolly, lolly.

5264
03:39:41,140 --> 03:39:42,040
It's your adverbs.

5265
03:39:42,620 --> 03:39:43,220
Here.

5266
03:39:45,900 --> 03:39:47,100
Okay, I'm gonna leave you.

5267
03:39:47,120 --> 03:39:47,680
Right here.

5268
03:39:47,840 --> 03:39:48,100
Okay?

5269
03:39:48,760 --> 03:39:49,200
Okay.

5270
03:39:49,620 --> 03:39:50,840
Don't do anything stupid!

5271
03:39:52,540 --> 03:39:53,300
Oh, gosh.

5272
03:39:54,300 --> 03:39:55,440
There's that guy up there.

5273
03:39:57,140 --> 03:39:57,960
What does he do?

5274
03:39:58,420 --> 03:39:59,000
What is...

5275
03:39:59,000 --> 03:39:59,540
What do you do?

5276
03:39:59,920 --> 03:40:00,960
Is there another guy?

5277
03:40:01,400 --> 03:40:02,480
Is there anyone else?

5278
03:40:03,200 --> 03:40:04,080
Is it just him?

5279
03:40:08,070 --> 03:40:08,650
He's asleep.

5280
03:40:10,070 --> 03:40:10,990
Is it just him?

5281
03:40:16,210 --> 03:40:17,630
Please go back to sleep!

03:40:48,030 --> 03:40:48,030
Please!

5374
03:40:48,030 --> 03:40:48,030
Please!

5375
03:40:48,030 --> 03:40:48,210
Please!

5376
03:40:48,210 --> 03:40:48,210
Please!

5377
03:40:48,210 --> 03:40:48,210
Please!

5378
03:40:48,210 --> 03:40:48,210
Please!

5379
03:40:48,210 --> 03:40:48,210
Please!

5380
03:40:48,550 --> 03:40:48,970
Please!

5381
03:40:49,250 --> 03:40:49,330
Please!

5382
03:40:49,330 --> 03:40:49,330
Please!

5383
03:40:49,330 --> 03:40:49,330
Please!

5384
03:40:49,330 --> 03:40:49,330
Please!

5385
03:40:49,330 --> 03:40:49,330
Please!

5386
03:40:49,330 --> 03:40:49,330
Please!

5387
03:40:49,390 --> 03:40:49,810
Please!

5388
03:40:49,910 --> 03:40:49,910
Please!

5389
03:40:50,070 --> 03:40:50,070
Please!

5390
03:40:50,070 --> 03:40:50,310
Please!

5391
03:40:56,770 --> 03:40:57,190
Please!

5392
03:41:07,200 --> 03:41:09,100
Please Get up, get up, get up.

5393
03:41:09,160 --> 03:41:09,760
Take my hand.

5394
03:42:23,340 --> 03:42:24,800
What can I do for you, Jack?

5395
03:42:25,720 --> 03:42:27,080
Oh god, Rose!

5396
03:42:42,170 --> 03:42:45,730
Jack, how far do you think the Patriots' digital control extends?

5397
03:42:46,210 --> 03:42:51,290
I don't really know, but it probably influences a lot of what goes on in our everyday lives.

5398
03:42:51,630 --> 03:42:56,690
Even mundane things like which movies and songs become a hit and what kind of clothes we wear?

5399
03:42:56,730 --> 03:42:59,170
I think taste would be the easiest thing to manipulate.

5400
03:42:59,430 --> 03:43:03,230
I mean, think about the kinds of film and bands everyone wants to go to see.

5401
03:43:03,430 --> 03:43:05,230
It's whatever's at the top of the chart.

5402
03:43:05,270 --> 03:43:06,310
What are you talking about?

5403
03:43:06,610 --> 03:43:07,610
And if the charts are made up...

5404
03:43:08,230 --> 03:43:08,510
Exactly.

5405
03:43:09,090 --> 03:43:11,750
But you can't really control individual taste.

5406
03:43:11,910 --> 03:43:13,890
It's too closely tied to personality.

5407
03:43:14,370 --> 03:43:14,670
Thank you.

5408
03:43:14,670 --> 03:43:15,390
I don't know about that.

5409
03:43:15,530 --> 03:43:17,970
Trends have always been about following the leader.

5410
03:43:18,170 --> 03:43:19,130
Not necessarily.

5411
03:43:19,630 --> 03:43:22,430
The age of direct personal interaction is over.

5412
03:43:22,690 --> 03:43:25,230
So is the idea of word-of-mouth communication.

5413
03:43:25,710 --> 03:43:28,370
Rose, you have any friends you've met online?

5414
03:43:29,130 --> 03:43:30,570
Yeah, I do.

5415
03:43:30,750 --> 03:43:31,350
How many?

5416
03:43:31,550 --> 03:43:35,250
Well, if you count only the ones I talk to a lot, I'd say about 20.

5417
03:43:35,270 --> 03:43:36,890
20 people?

5418
03:43:38,570 --> 03:43:40,610
One or two tops.

5419
03:43:40,630 --> 03:43:42,450
Rose, you have 20 friends on the internet?

5420
03:43:42,850 --> 03:43:44,010
That's how it is for everyone, I guess.

5421
03:43:44,030 --> 03:43:44,810
Oh my god.

5422
03:43:44,830 --> 03:43:50,890
Even if your online buddies had fake identities and were circulating false information, you'd have no way of knowing.

5423
03:43:50,890 --> 03:43:52,830
That's an insane amount of friends online.

5424
03:43:53,410 --> 03:43:53,830
Right.

5425
03:43:54,210 --> 03:43:57,190
And there'd be no way for you to know for sure.

5426
03:43:57,550 --> 03:44:00,130
Well, what about people who do meet face-to-face then?

5427
03:44:00,270 --> 03:44:00,710
My hands are shaking so much.

5428
03:44:00,710 --> 03:44:01,130
Like us.

5429
03:44:01,130 --> 03:44:01,590
Oh my god.

5430
03:44:01,790 --> 03:44:03,990
Have you ever really shown me the real you?

5431
03:44:03,990 --> 03:44:05,090
Why was that so easy?

5432
03:44:05,390 --> 03:44:06,750
I wouldn't even know the real me myself.

5433
03:44:07,230 --> 03:44:09,510
But you're being honest with yourself now.

5434
03:44:09,670 --> 03:44:10,630
That's going so easy.

5435
03:44:10,630 --> 03:44:11,090
Well, that's how I see it.

5436
03:44:11,530 --> 03:44:13,090
Well, how am I being honest?

5437
03:44:13,570 --> 03:44:15,930
I've never seen you show so much feeling.

5438
03:44:16,330 --> 03:44:18,970
Fear, anger, even a kind of giddiness.

5439
03:44:19,530 --> 03:44:25,850
It may seem a strange thing to say, but you're living out loud for the first time that I've seen.

5440
03:44:26,030 --> 03:44:27,750
I'm just trying to get the job done.

5441
03:44:28,010 --> 03:44:29,150
This is war, you know.

5442
03:44:29,150 --> 03:44:30,190
This is war, you know.

5443
03:44:30,190 --> 03:44:30,590
I do know that.

5444
03:44:30,590 --> 03:44:31,630
Okay, back to the game, everybody.

5445
03:44:31,630 --> 03:44:34,630
I see you're different from your usual restrained self.

5446
03:44:34,950 --> 03:44:36,010
What about you, then?

5447
03:44:36,190 --> 03:44:39,890
I always want to be open with you as much as I can.

5448
03:44:40,190 --> 03:44:40,450
What the heck are you talking about?

5449
03:44:42,230 --> 03:44:44,110
What the heck are you talking about?

5450
03:44:44,370 --> 03:44:45,430
Did I get all of them?

5451
03:44:48,390 --> 03:44:49,090
Which one?

5452
03:44:49,210 --> 03:44:49,770
Which strut?

5453
03:44:49,810 --> 03:44:50,030
Okay.

5454
03:44:50,430 --> 03:44:52,730
All right, now that I've... oh my gosh.

5455
03:44:53,430 --> 03:44:55,730
Oh, I feel so much relief.

5456
03:44:55,810 --> 03:44:57,110
Right, take Emma and head for Strut L.

5457
03:44:57,110 --> 03:44:57,690
Oh my god.

5458
03:44:57,730 --> 03:45:00,750
Strut L is on the south end of that KL connecting bridge.

5459
03:45:00,750 --> 03:45:01,030
Oh.

5460
03:45:02,370 --> 03:45:02,830
Okay.

5461
03:45:03,670 --> 03:45:04,830
Snake, are you online?

5462
03:45:06,710 --> 03:45:09,010
Raiden, I may have to sign off for a while.

5463
03:45:09,230 --> 03:45:09,990
Anything wrong?

5464
03:45:10,230 --> 03:45:11,430
Just a small errand.

5465
03:45:11,650 --> 03:45:12,690
Don't worry about it.

5466
03:45:12,790 --> 03:45:13,430
What's it about?

5467
03:45:14,070 --> 03:45:14,610
Here goes.

5468
03:45:14,970 --> 03:45:15,650
I'm going offline.

5469
03:45:15,790 --> 03:45:16,110
No!

5470
03:45:18,850 --> 03:45:19,770
He's offline.

5471
03:45:20,530 --> 03:45:21,770
Okay, Strut L.

5472
03:45:21,890 --> 03:45:22,390
Oh, gosh.

5473
03:45:22,410 --> 03:45:23,930
This part's kind of annoying, too, though.

5474
03:45:25,230 --> 03:45:25,890
Come on.

5475
03:45:26,510 --> 03:45:29,230
Oh, the anxiety was the real enemy all along.

5476
03:45:29,230 --> 03:45:30,290
Yup.

5477
03:45:33,890 --> 03:45:34,530
PSG.

5478
03:45:36,250 --> 03:45:36,890
Chaff.

5479
03:45:37,110 --> 03:45:37,610
Oh, my bad.

5480
03:45:37,710 --> 03:45:37,870
Sorry.

5481
03:45:39,930 --> 03:45:40,790
Here we go.

5482
03:45:43,050 --> 03:45:44,250
La la la.

5483
03:45:45,410 --> 03:45:46,310
Walking along.

5484
03:45:47,170 --> 03:45:48,250
Oh, be careful.

5485
03:45:49,070 --> 03:45:49,490
Oh.

5486
03:45:49,690 --> 03:45:50,810
Be careful.

5487
03:45:51,670 --> 03:45:53,250
Oh la la la.

5488
03:45:53,950 --> 03:45:54,930
Here we go.

5489
03:45:55,050 --> 03:45:56,670
Snake hates us, you guys.

5490
03:45:56,690 --> 03:45:57,450
He hates...

5491
03:45:58,570 --> 03:45:59,210
Oh,

5492
03:46:05,000 --> 03:46:05,000
no.

5493
03:46:05,020 --> 03:46:06,300
Guys, it's so...

5494
03:46:12,500 --> 03:46:12,900
Wait.

5495
03:46:12,940 --> 03:46:13,480
He can't see me.

5496
03:46:14,520 --> 03:46:14,920
Idiot.

5497
03:46:19,600 --> 03:46:20,940
Is there anybody else?

5498
03:46:22,240 --> 03:46:22,880
Just him?

5499
03:46:23,580 --> 03:46:24,340
Where'd you come from?

5500
03:46:24,400 --> 03:46:25,480
He must have come up the stairs.

5501
03:46:30,560 --> 03:46:32,480
Sometimes, their vision is like...

5502
03:46:32,960 --> 03:46:35,080
Sometimes, I feel like they actually have 180 IQ.

5503
03:46:36,400 --> 03:46:41,280
And sometimes, they're just dumb, dumb little guys who can't see two feet in front of them.

5504
03:46:41,880 --> 03:46:42,480
All right.

5505
03:46:42,500 --> 03:46:42,900
Let's go, Emma.

5506
03:46:43,300 --> 03:46:43,820
Come on.

5507
03:46:44,460 --> 03:46:44,980
Oh, wait.

5508
03:46:45,040 --> 03:46:45,940
I have to get the coolant.

5509
03:46:45,940 --> 03:46:46,260
Don't I?

5510
03:46:47,420 --> 03:46:48,240
Don't catch on fire.

5511
03:46:48,440 --> 03:46:48,820
Emma.

5512
03:46:49,100 --> 03:46:49,500
Emma.

5513
03:46:50,540 --> 03:46:50,940
Emma.

5514
03:46:51,120 --> 03:46:51,860
Stand back.

5515
03:46:53,160 --> 03:46:53,560
Watch.

5516
03:46:54,100 --> 03:46:57,760
As a pro takes the reins.

5517
03:47:00,520 --> 03:47:00,920
Oh.

5518
03:47:00,940 --> 03:47:01,240
Oh.

5519
03:47:01,280 --> 03:47:01,680
Sorry.

5520
03:47:01,860 --> 03:47:02,520
It's still on fire.

5521
03:47:02,680 --> 03:47:02,880
Okay.

5522
03:47:02,960 --> 03:47:03,860
Don't go, Emma.

5523
03:47:04,000 --> 03:47:04,280
Don't...

5524
03:47:04,280 --> 03:47:04,920
Emma.

5525
03:47:05,260 --> 03:47:06,520
It's still on fire.

5526
03:47:08,080 --> 03:47:08,480
Emma.

5527
03:47:08,600 --> 03:47:09,320
Let's go now.

5528
03:47:10,860 --> 03:47:11,260
Oh.

5529
03:47:15,150 --> 03:47:15,990
No.

5530
03:47:16,070 --> 03:47:17,470
These guys aren't genome soldiers.

5531
03:47:17,910 --> 03:47:20,090
I just like to say that they all have 180 IQ.

5532
03:47:20,630 --> 03:47:21,110
Okay.

5533
03:47:21,190 --> 03:47:21,850
I hate this part.

5534
03:47:22,150 --> 03:47:22,770
Oh, no.

5535
03:47:24,710 --> 03:47:25,490
We have...

5536
03:47:25,490 --> 03:47:26,230
We don't have a card.

5537
03:47:28,390 --> 03:47:28,970
Beep, beep.

5538
03:47:29,130 --> 03:47:29,450
Damn it.

5539
03:47:30,430 --> 03:47:31,070
What's wrong?

5540
03:47:31,790 --> 03:47:33,730
This door is security level five.

5541
03:47:33,910 --> 03:47:34,310
Five.

5542
03:47:34,310 --> 03:47:35,490
I don't have card five.

5543
03:47:35,650 --> 03:47:36,010
Damn.

5544
03:47:36,110 --> 03:47:37,650
I don't have card five.

5545
03:47:38,350 --> 03:47:39,350
You're such a baby.

5546
03:47:39,350 --> 03:47:40,030
Giving up already?

5547
03:47:40,430 --> 03:47:42,090
You're such a whiny baby.

5548
03:47:42,910 --> 03:47:44,610
I don't have card five.

5549
03:47:44,610 --> 03:47:45,050
Ta-da.

5550
03:47:45,090 --> 03:47:45,130
I don't have card five.

5551
03:47:46,090 --> 03:47:46,890
What the...

5552
03:47:46,890 --> 03:47:51,030
In European extreme, they're like insects directly telepathic paying your location.

5553
03:47:51,030 --> 03:47:52,490
You should have told me you had it.

5554
03:47:53,610 --> 03:47:54,090
God.

5555
03:47:54,230 --> 03:47:55,990
The truth is I just remembered it myself.

5556
03:47:56,210 --> 03:47:57,190
Why are you so mean?

5557
03:47:57,430 --> 03:47:58,770
Who cares if it...

5558
03:47:58,770 --> 03:47:59,570
You would have...

5559
03:47:59,570 --> 03:48:00,690
You didn't need it earlier.

5560
03:48:00,890 --> 03:48:02,410
Why are you such a jerk, Raiden?

5561
03:48:03,990 --> 03:48:04,470
Gosh.

5562
03:48:07,630 --> 03:48:09,410
Must have 195 IQ.

5563
03:48:09,990 --> 03:48:11,030
Yeah, pretty much.

5564
03:48:11,810 --> 03:48:12,430
All right.

5565
03:48:12,430 --> 03:48:12,830
Let's save.

5566
03:48:12,970 --> 03:48:13,570
I know.

5567
03:48:13,670 --> 03:48:14,130
I just...

5568
03:48:14,130 --> 03:48:15,130
I save so often.

5569
03:48:15,150 --> 03:48:22,130
And this one, because I love the drama, he has card five cheeks, though.

5570
03:48:24,210 --> 03:48:28,190
How could he be so mean to Rose, to Emma?

5571
03:48:33,940 --> 03:48:36,040
Oh, okay, she's got nothing to say to me.

5572
03:48:36,280 --> 03:48:36,920
All right, Colonel?

5573
03:48:42,260 --> 03:48:42,700
Okay.

5574
03:48:44,480 --> 03:48:44,840
Okay.

5575
03:48:46,300 --> 03:48:46,660
Okay.

5576
03:48:47,900 --> 03:48:49,480
I hope she's good with heights.

5577
03:48:50,460 --> 03:48:52,360
Okay, we don't have a nerd in this area.

5578
03:48:54,720 --> 03:48:55,620
But I hear them.

5579
03:49:00,960 --> 03:49:01,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

5580
03:49:07,790 --> 03:49:08,730
Where is that guy?

5581
03:49:11,670 --> 03:49:13,270
It's just the one guy, I believe, right?

5582
03:49:17,030 --> 03:49:17,970
Did I just say nerd?

5583
03:49:18,130 --> 03:49:18,930
Oh, sorry, node.

5584
03:49:20,450 --> 03:49:21,370
Where is he?

5585
03:49:22,690 --> 03:49:23,410
Doesn't he?

5586
03:49:24,190 --> 03:49:25,490
Doesn't he come over here?

5587
03:49:25,670 --> 03:49:26,450
Am I crazy?

5588
03:49:27,670 --> 03:49:28,430
Hey, guy!

5589
03:49:29,470 --> 03:49:30,310
Hey, guy!

5590
03:49:31,310 --> 03:49:31,870
Huh?

5591
03:49:32,030 --> 03:49:33,010
Where is that guy?

5592
03:49:38,880 --> 03:49:39,920
Where is he?

5593
03:49:40,320 --> 03:49:41,100
I'm scared.

5594
03:49:45,020 --> 03:49:46,140
I'm gonna...

5595
03:49:46,140 --> 03:49:46,760
Cool it!

5596
03:49:50,080 --> 03:49:51,860
I'm so... not cool it.

5597
03:50:10,270 --> 03:50:11,790
We'll get him when he walks over there.

5598
03:50:12,890 --> 03:50:13,710
No worries.

5599
03:50:14,390 --> 03:50:14,870
Oh.

5600
03:50:15,150 --> 03:50:15,630
Oh.

5601
03:50:16,090 --> 03:50:16,490
Oh.

5602
03:50:16,810 --> 03:50:17,290
Oh.

5603
03:50:18,090 --> 03:50:19,050
Okay, hold on.

5604
03:50:19,310 --> 03:50:19,790
Oh.

5605
03:50:19,910 --> 03:50:20,390
Oh.

5606
03:50:20,930 --> 03:50:21,610
Oh, shoot.

5607
03:50:21,850 --> 03:50:22,930
Oh, there's two guys!

5608
03:50:23,250 --> 03:50:24,250
There are two guys.

5609
03:50:24,670 --> 03:50:25,530
There's two guys.

5610
03:50:25,650 --> 03:50:26,310
I believe...

5611
03:50:27,070 --> 03:50:28,370
I believe there's two guys.

5612
03:50:28,930 --> 03:50:30,090
I think there's two guys.

5613
03:50:30,510 --> 03:50:31,810
I think there's two guys.

5614
03:50:32,710 --> 03:50:33,890
You guys, there's two guys.

5615
03:50:35,550 --> 03:50:36,730
There's two guys!

5616
03:50:36,750 --> 03:50:37,230
Oh!

5617
03:50:37,230 --> 03:50:37,870
Uhhh...

5618
03:50:37,870 --> 03:50:38,450
Ah!

5619
03:50:42,090 --> 03:50:42,530
Okay.

5620
03:50:43,650 --> 03:50:44,730
Now let me take him.

5621
03:50:45,550 --> 03:50:46,330
Now he's down.

5622
03:50:46,530 --> 03:50:47,310
Now get your brother.

5623
03:50:48,490 --> 03:50:49,670
Enemy in the area.

5624
03:50:50,050 --> 03:50:51,310
Increase security level.

5625
03:50:52,030 --> 03:50:53,150
What are you talking about?

5626
03:50:53,550 --> 03:50:53,990
Understood.

5627
03:50:54,190 --> 03:50:55,390
Your friend just passed out!

5628
03:50:55,790 --> 03:50:56,810
You guys, extreme caution.

5629
03:50:57,850 --> 03:50:58,290
Emma...

5630
03:50:58,750 --> 03:50:59,190
Emma...

5631
03:50:59,190 --> 03:50:59,570
I might have...

5632
03:50:59,570 --> 03:51:00,810
Emma, don't just sit there.

5633
03:51:00,830 --> 03:51:01,690
Emma, I might have made a mistake.

5634
03:51:01,810 --> 03:51:02,150
Emma...

5635
03:51:03,070 --> 03:51:03,510
Emma...

5636
03:51:04,350 --> 03:51:05,590
Emma, I think I made a mistake.

5637
03:51:05,710 --> 03:51:06,090
Emma...

5638
03:51:06,910 --> 03:51:07,350
Emma...

5639
03:51:07,810 --> 03:51:08,250
Emma...

5640
03:51:08,250 --> 03:51:08,470
Emma...

5641
03:51:08,470 --> 03:51:08,670
Emma...

5642
03:51:13,070 --> 03:51:13,490
Emma?

5643
03:51:13,490 --> 03:51:13,910
Emma?

5644
03:51:14,250 --> 03:51:17,190
I think I made a little whoopsie.

5645
03:51:18,070 --> 03:51:19,490
Emma, don't be mad at me.

5646
03:51:19,510 --> 03:51:21,190
Emma, why don't you look at me anymore?

5647
03:51:21,590 --> 03:51:27,430
I thought he was going to go get his friend and wake him up.

5648
03:51:27,910 --> 03:51:29,470
Oh, she needs a box too.

5649
03:51:29,750 --> 03:51:30,750
Are they going to come over here?

5650
03:51:31,310 --> 03:51:32,350
I sure hope not.

5651
03:51:33,650 --> 03:51:36,930
Why am I even wishing for that?

5652
03:51:37,410 --> 03:51:37,850
Emma?

5653
03:51:38,350 --> 03:51:40,290
Emma, just stay put, okay?

5654
03:51:40,610 --> 03:51:42,370
Just you stay there.

5655
03:51:42,610 --> 03:51:44,310
Do they think about your actions, Missy?

5656
03:51:44,490 --> 03:51:46,790
In the timeout corner over there.

5657
03:51:47,090 --> 03:51:49,370
We're just waiting for the caution to run out, okay, Emma?

5658
03:51:49,610 --> 03:51:51,230
Don't worry about it, Emma.

5659
03:51:58,530 --> 03:51:59,750
She can't hear you.

5660
03:51:59,750 --> 03:52:01,330
She has her AirPods in.

5661
03:52:05,260 --> 03:52:08,760
Alright, let's try that again.

5662
03:52:10,720 --> 03:52:15,200
Let's try that again without messing up this time.

5663
03:52:16,380 --> 03:52:17,180
Okay, Raiden.

5664
03:52:24,590 --> 03:52:28,370
Now, what we need to do is not mess it up.

5665
03:52:32,110 --> 03:52:33,990
Some instincts as a gamer.

5666
03:52:34,770 --> 03:52:36,710
Oh gosh, can this guy see me?

5667
03:52:48,940 --> 03:52:50,540
Okay, now investigate your friend.

5668
03:52:50,780 --> 03:52:52,340
Your friend just fell asleep.

5669
03:52:53,760 --> 03:52:55,500
Are you going to not notice him?

5670
03:52:55,880 --> 03:52:56,240
Or...

5671
03:52:57,420 --> 03:52:57,780
Okay.

5672
03:52:58,820 --> 03:52:59,880
Oh, oh, he did.

5673
03:53:00,100 --> 03:53:01,140
He just kicked him awake.

5674
03:53:02,840 --> 03:53:03,460
Oh, shoot.

5675
03:53:09,570 --> 03:53:09,930
Okay.

5676
03:53:09,930 --> 03:53:10,990
Do you have any stun grenades?

5677
03:53:11,950 --> 03:53:15,470
I think I do, but Emma will also be stunned, will she not?

5678
03:53:17,550 --> 03:53:18,730
Oh, he's going to walk over.

5679
03:53:18,830 --> 03:53:20,030
Okay, let me see if I can get him now.

5680
03:53:21,350 --> 03:53:22,030
Oh, there we go.

5681
03:53:22,070 --> 03:53:22,350
There we go.

5682
03:53:23,370 --> 03:53:23,810
Okay.

5683
03:53:25,930 --> 03:53:26,650
Come on, Emma.

5684
03:53:28,450 --> 03:53:29,910
We just needed him in position.

5685
03:53:31,110 --> 03:53:31,830
Oh, oh, oh.

5686
03:53:31,890 --> 03:53:32,750
Okay, we're good.

5687
03:53:33,010 --> 03:53:33,470
Let's go.

5688
03:53:34,650 --> 03:53:35,290
They're asleep.

5689
03:53:36,310 --> 03:53:36,970
Sleepy fellas.

5690
03:53:39,030 --> 03:53:40,910
Such sleepy fellas right there.

5691
03:53:45,210 --> 03:53:46,590
Drag her by the legs.

5692
03:53:46,670 --> 03:53:49,490
But if you drag her by the legs, she will...

5693
03:53:49,490 --> 03:53:51,330
You can't go through doors, I'm pretty sure.

5694
03:53:52,470 --> 03:53:54,930
I don't think you can take her through doors if you drag her.

5695
03:53:55,410 --> 03:53:55,890
Come on.

5696
03:53:55,950 --> 03:53:56,730
In through here.

5697
03:53:56,970 --> 03:53:57,990
And down the hatch.

5698
03:53:59,970 --> 03:54:00,670
Big shells.

5699
03:54:00,750 --> 03:54:01,250
E.P.S.

5700
03:54:01,310 --> 03:54:01,490
soldiers.

5701
03:54:04,830 --> 03:54:05,230
Alrighty.

5702
03:54:08,130 --> 03:54:09,490
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5703
03:54:11,890 --> 03:54:13,570
Are you afraid of heights, Emma?

5704
03:54:13,670 --> 03:54:14,110
Are you okay?

5705
03:54:14,370 --> 03:54:15,490
You're good with heights too?

5706
03:54:24,470 --> 03:54:27,590
It's crazy how much and how little of the game we have left, isn't it?

5707
03:54:29,870 --> 03:54:30,950
What if we...

5708
03:54:30,950 --> 03:54:32,390
I have a question for you.

5709
03:54:32,570 --> 03:54:33,310
What is it?

5710
03:54:33,470 --> 03:54:35,150
How do you feel about heights?

5711
03:54:35,550 --> 03:54:37,090
I can't say I like heights.

5712
03:54:37,330 --> 03:54:39,310
The water's higher on my phobia list.

5713
03:54:39,510 --> 03:54:39,770
I'm self-centered.

5714
03:54:39,770 --> 03:54:40,390
I'm self -centered?

5715
03:54:40,670 --> 03:54:42,450
Well, we have to go down the ladder.

5716
03:54:42,770 --> 03:54:43,790
How far down?

5717
03:54:44,250 --> 03:54:45,430
Just a little bit.

5718
03:54:45,650 --> 03:54:45,990
Too high.

5719
03:54:45,990 --> 03:54:48,070
Why do I feel like we've had this conversation before?

5720
03:54:48,170 --> 03:54:49,650
How little is little?

5721
03:54:50,690 --> 03:54:52,110
About 130 feet.

5722
03:54:52,710 --> 03:54:53,150
Huh.

5723
03:54:53,450 --> 03:54:54,550
Think you can do it?

5724
03:54:54,910 --> 03:54:56,430
Would you take no for an answer?

5725
03:54:56,650 --> 03:54:57,690
How are your legs?

5726
03:54:57,690 --> 03:54:58,510
Better.

5727
03:54:58,650 --> 03:55:00,010
The numbness is gone.

5728
03:55:00,270 --> 03:55:01,950
I can climb down on my own.

5729
03:55:02,030 --> 03:55:03,230
It's cute when the numbness is gone.

5730
03:55:03,270 --> 03:55:03,770
Okay, follow me.

5731
03:55:06,090 --> 03:55:09,150
So cute when her numbness is all better.

5732
03:55:09,670 --> 03:55:11,430
She's got little legs that work.

5733
03:55:13,270 --> 03:55:14,070
Here we go.

5734
03:55:15,110 --> 03:55:15,550
Sweat.

5735
03:55:15,550 --> 03:55:16,030
This is...

5736
03:55:16,030 --> 03:55:21,230
It's about to be one of my favorite, like, vistas of the game.

5737
03:55:23,570 --> 03:55:25,450
Don't look up or skirt right in.

5738
03:55:25,570 --> 03:55:26,550
Oh, she's wearing shorts.

5739
03:55:26,610 --> 03:55:27,050
Okay, never mind.

5740
03:55:33,240 --> 03:55:34,220
What a thrill.

5741
03:55:35,580 --> 03:55:39,020
We're darkness and silence through the night.

5742
03:55:40,960 --> 03:55:42,580
Make sure to have the d-mic ready.

5743
03:55:42,680 --> 03:55:43,760
Oh, you know it!

5744
03:55:44,680 --> 03:55:45,200
Right...

5745
03:55:45,960 --> 03:55:48,260
The sunset, it's beautiful.

5746
03:55:48,620 --> 03:55:49,140
Right...

5747
03:55:50,960 --> 03:55:51,480
Here.

5748
03:55:55,340 --> 03:55:58,180
If we don't hurry, it'll be the last thing we see.

5749
03:55:58,220 --> 03:55:59,820
This whole area is like my favorite...

5750
03:55:59,820 --> 03:56:00,620
Oh, here!

5751
03:56:00,620 --> 03:56:01,180
Here, here, here, there.

5752
03:56:01,400 --> 03:56:03,380
This is my favorite scene in the game.

5753
03:56:03,520 --> 03:56:05,380
Or like, view in the game.

5754
03:56:05,480 --> 03:56:06,420
It's so pretty.

5755
03:56:06,920 --> 03:56:08,160
It's so nice.

5756
03:56:08,340 --> 03:56:09,360
It's so cute.

5757
03:56:12,680 --> 03:56:13,120
Okay.

5758
03:56:13,120 --> 03:56:13,780
I'm ready.

5759
03:56:32,220 --> 03:56:34,880
So beautiful here.

5760
03:56:40,990 --> 03:56:42,390
Raiden?

5761
03:56:42,390 --> 03:56:42,670
Ow.

5762
03:56:52,950 --> 03:56:57,370
The oil fence.

5763
03:56:57,370 --> 03:56:59,050
There are ciphers and several guards.

5764
03:56:59,430 --> 03:57:02,690
Raiden, you're carrying a PSG-1, aren't you?

5765
03:57:02,690 --> 03:57:04,030
It's time to play sniper.

5766
03:57:04,770 --> 03:57:05,650
Not bad.

5767
03:57:05,910 --> 03:57:08,550
This spot gives me a good view of the targets.

5768
03:57:08,850 --> 03:57:12,110
You're going to have to cover Emma until she crosses to Strut E.

5769
03:57:12,330 --> 03:57:14,650
I'll get there and provide some support of my own.

5770
03:57:14,750 --> 03:57:15,230
Yay!

5771
03:57:15,390 --> 03:57:16,650
Think you can handle it?

5772
03:57:16,730 --> 03:57:17,170
I can.

5773
03:57:17,290 --> 03:57:18,250
I know the drill.

5774
03:57:18,430 --> 03:57:19,010
I know the drill.

5775
03:57:19,010 --> 03:57:24,090
I faced a similar situation in Advanced Mode Level 4 VR training with the PSG-1.

5776
03:57:24,190 --> 03:57:26,810
Advanced Mode Level 4 VR.

5777
03:57:26,810 --> 03:57:27,350
I guess it's better to go.

5778
03:57:27,370 --> 03:57:27,550
Nothing.

5779
03:57:28,150 --> 03:57:29,870
Make sure you don't hit Emma.

5780
03:57:29,910 --> 03:57:30,610
No promises.

5781
03:57:30,910 --> 03:57:34,330
Right now, with Arsenal's boarding in progress, security should be at a minimum.

5782
03:57:34,610 --> 03:57:36,850
That doesn't mean it's going to be easy.

5783
03:57:37,430 --> 03:57:41,970
Given the situation, they probably got claymores in place to make up for the security shortage.

5784
03:57:42,170 --> 03:57:43,090
Oh, I forgot about the claymores.

5785
03:57:43,090 --> 03:57:43,090
You're right.

5786
03:57:43,090 --> 03:57:44,550
Make sure you use your thermal goggles.

5787
03:57:44,630 --> 03:57:46,230
I have the thermal goggles.

5788
03:57:46,390 --> 03:57:46,790
Okay.

5789
03:57:46,790 --> 03:57:47,570
I'm heading for Strut E.

5790
03:57:47,570 --> 03:57:50,530
When Snake tells me to use thermal goggles, I don't mind so much.

5791
03:57:51,270 --> 03:57:53,110
I'm going to clear a path for you from here.

5792
03:57:53,270 --> 03:57:53,610
How?

5793
03:57:54,070 --> 03:57:54,670
Sniper fire.

5794
03:57:55,050 --> 03:57:55,710
You're kidding.

5795
03:57:56,130 --> 03:57:56,750
Trust me.

5796
03:57:57,370 --> 03:57:58,590
What if I fall into the sea?

5797
03:57:58,730 --> 03:57:59,830
I can't swim.

5798
03:58:00,130 --> 03:58:01,930
You were doing pretty good a few minutes ago.

5799
03:58:02,550 --> 03:58:02,990
Okay.

5800
03:58:03,610 --> 03:58:04,650
Think you can do it?

5801
03:58:04,650 --> 03:58:05,210
Loud and clear.

5802
03:58:05,250 --> 03:58:06,050
Would you take no for an answer?

5803
03:58:06,310 --> 03:58:06,730
What's that supposed to mean?

5804
03:58:06,750 --> 03:58:07,130
No.

5805
03:58:07,470 --> 03:58:07,910
No.

5806
03:58:07,950 --> 03:58:08,290
All right.

5807
03:58:08,290 --> 03:58:08,930
Get going.

5808
03:58:09,010 --> 03:58:09,850
You'll be fine.

5809
03:58:11,670 --> 03:58:12,110
Okay.

5810
03:58:13,770 --> 03:58:15,330
What's that supposed to mean?

5811
03:58:16,090 --> 03:58:17,170
Time to blind yourself.

5812
03:58:17,410 --> 03:58:17,850
True.

5813
03:58:18,250 --> 03:58:19,250
Oh, golly.

5814
03:58:19,850 --> 03:58:20,410
All right.

5815
03:58:20,430 --> 03:58:20,970
Here she goes.

5816
03:58:21,910 --> 03:58:23,290
And here we go.

5817
03:58:24,070 --> 03:58:25,090
Let's grab some ammo.

5818
03:58:25,990 --> 03:58:27,350
And let's get into place.

5819
03:58:27,350 --> 03:58:27,370
Let's get into position.

5820
03:58:36,120 --> 03:58:37,280
Oh, that's right.

5821
03:58:37,400 --> 03:58:37,540
Oh.

5822
03:58:37,900 --> 03:58:38,900
Okay, everybody.

5823
03:58:39,060 --> 03:58:39,700
I'm so sorry.

5824
03:58:41,200 --> 03:58:42,560
Oh, possessive means too.

5825
03:58:43,860 --> 03:58:44,660
Where is it?

5826
03:58:44,740 --> 03:58:45,000
Sorry.

5827
03:58:45,080 --> 03:58:46,040
I can never find everything.

5828
03:58:47,340 --> 03:58:47,860
Okay.

5829
03:58:48,320 --> 03:58:49,120
Thermal goggles.

5830
03:58:49,320 --> 03:58:49,480
Let's go.

5831
03:58:58,050 --> 03:58:58,750
All right.

5832
03:58:58,850 --> 03:58:59,410
You good?

5833
03:59:00,610 --> 03:59:01,370
We're good.

5834
03:59:02,070 --> 03:59:02,930
Look at her.

5835
03:59:05,150 --> 03:59:06,270
Let's get this guy.

5836
03:59:06,370 --> 03:59:06,690
Let's get this guy.

5837
03:59:06,690 --> 03:59:07,530
Let's take this guy out.

5838
03:59:14,010 --> 03:59:14,430
Nice.

5839
03:59:14,830 --> 03:59:16,310
And the ciphers.

5840
03:59:16,650 --> 03:59:17,990
Let's start taking those out.

5841
03:59:21,590 --> 03:59:22,450
Oh, dang it.

5842
03:59:25,430 --> 03:59:27,170
It was the possessive means fault, everybody.

5843
03:59:29,410 --> 03:59:29,930
Wasn't me.

5844
03:59:30,250 --> 03:59:31,110
It wasn't me.

5845
03:59:32,730 --> 03:59:33,770
It wasn't me.

5846
03:59:36,250 --> 03:59:38,470
I know I don't need it for this part, but...

5847
03:59:38,470 --> 03:59:39,310
Oh, my God.

5848
03:59:40,770 --> 03:59:41,390
There we go.

5849
03:59:41,490 --> 03:59:41,750
Okay.

5850
03:59:41,830 --> 03:59:42,190
Okay.

5851
03:59:42,210 --> 03:59:43,010
A ARE.

5852
03:59:43,010 --> 03:59:43,410
Okey -dokey.

5853
03:59:44,870 --> 03:59:45,310
And...

5854
03:59:46,430 --> 03:59:47,790
Take this guy out.

5855
03:59:47,930 --> 03:59:48,030
Oh...

5856
03:59:51,670 --> 03:59:52,790
It's over here, right?

5857
03:59:52,850 --> 03:59:53,270
There's more.

5858
03:59:53,590 --> 03:59:54,790
Look at her go...

5859
03:59:54,790 --> 03:59:54,970
Ah!

5860
03:59:55,150 --> 03:59:55,670
There's another one!

5861
04:00:06,040 --> 04:00:07,460
Oh, are you kidding me?

5862
04:00:07,660 --> 04:00:08,920
Are you kidding me right now?

5863
04:00:09,080 --> 04:00:10,260
Are you kidding me right now?

5864
04:00:12,640 --> 04:00:13,260
Are you...

5865
04:00:13,260 --> 04:00:13,960
Sleep!

5866
04:00:35,000 --> 04:00:36,300
All is well!

5867
04:00:36,480 --> 04:00:37,660
All is well!

5868
04:00:38,760 --> 04:00:40,120
Where are the other ones?

5869
04:00:40,680 --> 04:00:41,760
Oh, let's take this out.

5870
04:00:43,660 --> 04:00:45,380
Can I zoom with this?

5871
04:00:46,100 --> 04:00:47,200
Zoom in with... oh.

5872
04:00:47,900 --> 04:00:49,740
Am I just not looking in the right places?

5873
04:00:50,000 --> 04:00:50,840
Oh, that's a guy.

5874
04:00:51,140 --> 04:00:51,780
That's a man.

5875
04:00:52,660 --> 04:00:54,480
There were other mines though, weren't there?

5876
04:00:55,280 --> 04:00:56,400
Let's take this guy out.

5877
04:01:01,000 --> 04:01:02,060
I think I got him.

5878
04:01:03,260 --> 04:01:03,740
Shoot.

5879
04:01:06,180 --> 04:01:07,400
I think he'll fall asleep.

5880
04:01:10,280 --> 04:01:10,760
Yeah.

5881
04:01:13,820 --> 04:01:14,980
Mine's on the third bridge.

5882
04:01:15,480 --> 04:01:15,940
Oh!

5883
04:01:18,040 --> 04:01:20,660
I'm just taking stuff out while we wait.

5884
04:01:27,000 --> 04:01:27,760
You good?

5885
04:01:27,860 --> 04:01:29,180
Everybody's sleepy, sleepy.

5886
04:01:29,760 --> 04:01:30,560
Sleepy, sleepy, sleepy.

5887
04:01:31,740 --> 04:01:32,400
Everybody's sleepy.

5888
04:01:33,380 --> 04:01:34,000
Nobody's awake.

5889
04:01:36,220 --> 04:01:37,200
Don't do it Raiden.

5890
04:01:37,300 --> 04:01:37,980
Don't do it Raiden.

5891
04:01:38,100 --> 04:01:39,060
Don't do it Raiden.

5892
04:01:39,280 --> 04:01:40,480
Oh, your shaky hands.

5893
04:01:41,040 --> 04:01:41,520
Raiden.

5894
04:01:42,220 --> 04:01:42,700
Raiden.

5895
04:01:44,440 --> 04:01:44,920
Nice.

5896
04:01:46,140 --> 04:01:47,920
I don't need no sesame...

5897
04:01:49,200 --> 04:01:50,420
Oh, directional mic.

5898
04:01:50,680 --> 04:01:51,740
Oh my god, that's a man.

5899
04:01:51,940 --> 04:01:52,380
Hold on.

5900
04:01:52,480 --> 04:01:53,620
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

5901
04:01:56,920 --> 04:01:57,960
Wait, sorry.

5902
04:01:58,060 --> 04:01:59,220
I need this first.

5903
04:02:08,770 --> 04:02:09,870
Oh, that's a bird.

5904
04:02:10,690 --> 04:02:11,890
Scaring me for a second.

5905
04:02:12,190 --> 04:02:13,630
Where's the directional mic?

5906
04:02:13,630 --> 04:02:15,150
The mic is with the mic.

5907
04:02:18,690 --> 04:02:19,390
Where is she?

5908
04:02:22,720 --> 04:02:23,420
There she is.

5909
04:02:24,040 --> 04:02:25,140
Go Emma, go!

5910
04:02:27,240 --> 04:02:28,320
Go Emma, go!

5911
04:02:32,620 --> 04:02:33,740
Did they stay asleep?

5912
04:02:33,980 --> 04:02:35,180
Or did they wake back up?

5913
04:02:37,800 --> 04:02:39,760
Oh shoot, oh shoot, oh shoot, oh shoot.

5914
04:02:41,820 --> 04:02:43,540
Um, I think I should be good.

5915
04:02:45,260 --> 04:02:49,640
Good Emma, don't worry about it, girlie.

5916
04:02:49,640 --> 04:02:50,800
Don't worry, I got you.

5917
04:02:52,480 --> 04:02:53,480
Don't worry, Emma.

5918
04:02:54,360 --> 04:02:55,260
Emma, I got you.

5919
04:02:55,580 --> 04:02:56,380
Emma, I got you.

5920
04:02:56,660 --> 04:02:58,800
Emma, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

5921
04:03:04,170 --> 04:03:05,450
This is Snake.

5922
04:03:05,650 --> 04:03:06,390
Can you hear me?

5923
04:03:06,570 --> 04:03:08,010
Yeah, loud and clear.

5924
04:03:08,450 --> 04:03:10,870
I've reached my sniping position on Strut E.

5925
04:03:11,130 --> 04:03:13,030
I'll provide support fire from here.

5926
04:03:13,210 --> 04:03:13,690
Thanks.

5927
04:03:13,750 --> 04:03:16,610
Do me a favor and take out whatever I miss.

5928
04:03:16,910 --> 04:03:18,750
Just call me when you want me to shoot.

5929
04:03:18,750 --> 04:03:19,950
Oh, okay.

5930
04:03:20,830 --> 04:03:21,430
Alright.

5931
04:03:21,730 --> 04:03:23,110
Oh, my bad, sorry.

5932
04:03:24,970 --> 04:03:26,170
She's gonna...

5933
04:03:26,170 --> 04:03:28,610
This is where the de-mic is most important.

5934
04:03:28,970 --> 04:03:30,130
But also...

5935
04:03:30,590 --> 04:03:31,850
We can de-mic...

5936
04:03:33,710 --> 04:03:34,910
Over here...

5937
04:03:36,150 --> 04:03:37,130
Where is he?

5938
04:03:37,490 --> 04:03:38,430
Where is that guy?

5939
04:03:41,250 --> 04:03:42,390
Someone's talking to himself.

5940
04:03:44,090 --> 04:03:45,490
Where is he?

5941
04:03:46,750 --> 04:03:47,350
Ah!

5942
04:03:48,750 --> 04:03:49,430
Oh, my god, sorry.

5943
04:03:49,590 --> 04:03:50,350
I'm so sorry, Emma.

5944
04:03:50,570 --> 04:03:50,930
Emma!

5945
04:03:51,750 --> 04:03:53,850
Emma, I'm so sorry, girl.

5946
04:03:53,970 --> 04:03:54,690
I'm so...

5947
04:03:57,350 --> 04:03:57,830
Don't worry!

5948
04:03:58,610 --> 04:03:59,050
Don't worry!

5949
04:04:01,870 --> 04:04:02,470
You're safe!

5950
04:04:03,430 --> 04:04:03,790
Keep...

5951
04:04:03,790 --> 04:04:05,330
Oh, gosh, there's another guy here.

5952
04:04:08,470 --> 04:04:09,290
Oh, my god, wait.

5953
04:04:09,430 --> 04:04:10,850
Oh, your friend is...

5954
04:04:14,390 --> 04:04:15,890
Oh, my god, there's multiple of them.

5955
04:04:16,590 --> 04:04:17,810
Why are there so many of you guys?

5956
04:04:18,510 --> 04:04:20,190
I don't think I hit a sniper.

5957
04:04:20,210 --> 04:04:22,490
I don't think I hit a single...

5958
04:04:22,490 --> 04:04:22,890
I don't think I hit a single shot.

5959
04:04:27,530 --> 04:04:29,810
Hey, can you, like, all fall asleep...

5960
04:04:29,810 --> 04:04:31,950
So I can do the funny stuff?

5961
04:04:32,290 --> 04:04:32,870
Where is she?

5962
04:04:33,470 --> 04:04:34,930
Wait, where did she go?

5963
04:04:35,910 --> 04:04:36,870
Oh, there she is.

5964
04:04:37,290 --> 04:04:39,110
There we go.

5965
04:04:40,150 --> 04:04:41,990
I got you in my sights.

5966
04:04:42,910 --> 04:04:43,830
Snake can help.

5967
04:04:44,170 --> 04:04:44,850
I know.

5968
04:04:46,190 --> 04:04:46,990
Okay, there we go.

5969
04:04:47,130 --> 04:04:47,610
Alright.

5970
04:04:47,610 --> 04:04:49,730
All clear, probably.

5971
04:04:53,310 --> 04:04:54,890
Yeah, I'll call Snake to do the rush.

5972
04:04:55,830 --> 04:04:56,470
Thanks, Snake!

5973
04:04:58,170 --> 04:05:00,070
Damn, I don't think I can do this.

5974
04:05:00,290 --> 04:05:01,730
Snake, take over for me.

5975
04:05:01,810 --> 04:05:02,270
Take over me.

5976
04:05:02,610 --> 04:05:04,770
Oh, you can zoom in with the mic.

5977
04:05:04,770 --> 04:05:06,350
I'm going to show you how sniping should be handled.

5978
04:05:06,590 --> 04:05:07,430
Take a good look.

5979
04:05:07,510 --> 04:05:08,170
Okay, thank you.

5980
04:05:08,230 --> 04:05:08,770
Take out the mines.

5981
04:05:08,770 --> 04:05:12,690
My sniping field will be limited to the area you're watching through your PSG-1 scope.

5982
04:05:12,690 --> 04:05:16,610
Keep a good look out on Emma's surroundings, even while I'm shooting, alright?

5983
04:05:16,890 --> 04:05:17,150
Okay.

5984
04:05:19,310 --> 04:05:20,850
D-mic time.

5985
04:05:22,430 --> 04:05:23,590
Hold in first person.

5986
04:05:23,690 --> 04:05:24,790
Move with left analog stick.

5987
04:05:25,090 --> 04:05:26,790
How did all this happen?

5988
04:05:27,850 --> 04:05:28,950
This poor girl.

5989
04:05:30,630 --> 04:05:31,390
You okay?

5990
04:05:31,750 --> 04:05:32,710
Just step over.

5991
04:05:32,750 --> 04:05:33,510
What am I doing here?

5992
04:05:34,310 --> 04:05:35,930
Just step over them.

5993
04:05:36,370 --> 04:05:37,110
It's fine.

5994
04:05:38,670 --> 04:05:40,650
How did all this happen?

5995
04:05:42,310 --> 04:05:43,610
Can you take out this one?

5996
04:05:44,510 --> 04:05:44,990
Snake!

5997
04:05:45,210 --> 04:05:46,230
Take out this one!

5998
04:05:46,550 --> 04:05:47,030
Nice.

5999
04:05:48,270 --> 04:05:48,750
Any...

6000
04:05:49,790 --> 04:05:51,650
Any mines down there?

6001
04:05:53,030 --> 04:05:54,010
Take out that one.

6002
04:05:54,130 --> 04:05:54,710
Take out that one.

6003
04:05:55,770 --> 04:05:57,030
Take out that one.

6004
04:05:58,190 --> 04:05:58,670
Nice.

6005
04:05:58,670 --> 04:05:59,510
Good job, Snake.

6006
04:05:59,810 --> 04:06:00,550
There he is.

6007
04:06:07,350 --> 04:06:08,930
You horn dog, you.

6008
04:06:10,910 --> 04:06:12,330
How did all this happen?

6009
04:06:13,270 --> 04:06:14,290
How did all this happen?

6010
04:06:14,730 --> 04:06:15,450
How did all this happen?

6011
04:06:15,470 --> 04:06:15,510
Wait.

6012
04:06:17,850 --> 04:06:18,290
Nice.

6013
04:06:21,810 --> 04:06:22,250
Okay.

6014
04:06:22,730 --> 04:06:23,990
Now we can do the D-mic.

6015
04:06:24,310 --> 04:06:25,610
Wait, did you just kill that guy?

6016
04:06:30,260 --> 04:06:30,840
Oh, no.

6017
04:06:30,920 --> 04:06:31,360
He's still...

6018
04:06:31,360 --> 04:06:32,480
He's still kicking.

6019
04:06:37,920 --> 04:06:38,960
Here it is.

6020
04:06:39,360 --> 04:06:39,820
A girl?

6021
04:06:40,680 --> 04:06:41,780
What are you doing here?

6022
04:06:42,020 --> 04:06:44,180
It's not my choice, thank you very much.

6023
04:06:45,540 --> 04:06:47,560
You're not gonna shoot me.

6024
04:06:47,980 --> 04:06:48,420
No.

6025
04:06:48,660 --> 04:06:49,260
Why not?

6026
04:06:51,840 --> 04:06:53,220
Otherwise you'll get hit with diarrhea.

6027
04:06:54,240 --> 04:06:56,340
One of the few things I learned from Shadow Moses.

6028
04:06:56,880 --> 04:06:58,180
What are you talking about?

6029
04:06:58,240 --> 04:06:59,180
What are you talking about?

6030
04:06:59,780 --> 04:07:00,860
Don't worry about it.

6031
04:07:01,140 --> 04:07:04,920
I have no idea what you're talking about, but does this mean you're letting me go?

6032
04:07:05,320 --> 04:07:08,100
Well, you could have found a nicer way to say that.

6033
04:07:08,220 --> 04:07:08,620
Oh.

6034
04:07:08,700 --> 04:07:10,040
Better hurry.

6035
04:07:11,200 --> 04:07:12,000
Don't mention it.

6036
04:07:12,060 --> 04:07:13,080
Just run like hell.

6037
04:07:13,200 --> 04:07:13,620
Oh, God.

6038
04:07:14,200 --> 04:07:14,900
Oh, no.

6039
04:07:15,060 --> 04:07:15,680
Oh, no.

6040
04:07:18,240 --> 04:07:20,020
This place is about to sink.

6041
04:07:20,220 --> 04:07:21,340
Just get out faster.

6042
04:07:22,260 --> 04:07:22,980
Johnny!

6043
04:07:23,660 --> 04:07:23,680
Wait!

6044
04:07:24,480 --> 04:07:26,100
What's your name?

6045
04:07:26,580 --> 04:07:27,640
Don't have one.

6046
04:07:28,240 --> 04:07:29,600
Okay, fine.

6047
04:07:29,980 --> 04:07:31,100
It's Johnny.

6048
04:07:33,460 --> 04:07:36,540
Hey, if we run into each other again...

6049
04:07:38,440 --> 04:07:40,620
What a weird guy.

6050
04:07:43,260 --> 04:07:45,580
Okay, now we have to be serious.

6051
04:07:45,740 --> 04:07:47,520
Okay, there's a lot going on around here.

6052
04:07:47,720 --> 04:07:48,620
Okay, let's...

6053
04:07:48,620 --> 04:07:49,520
Here, let's...

6054
04:07:50,240 --> 04:07:50,880
Take this.

6055
04:07:53,080 --> 04:07:54,120
I'm gonna try and...

6056
04:07:54,120 --> 04:07:55,060
Shoot this guy.

6057
04:07:56,100 --> 04:07:57,840
Snake, you can do that too.

6058
04:07:59,040 --> 04:08:00,080
Okay, you can do that.

6059
04:08:09,070 --> 04:08:09,570
Oh, my God.

6060
04:08:09,610 --> 04:08:09,830
Snake!

6061
04:08:10,150 --> 04:08:11,070
You said you would do it!

6062
04:08:12,530 --> 04:08:13,110
That was me.

6063
04:08:15,590 --> 04:08:16,130
Oh, my God.

6064
04:08:16,190 --> 04:08:17,010
Here, I'll take out this one.

6065
04:08:18,150 --> 04:08:18,630
There we go.

6066
04:08:18,690 --> 04:08:19,050
That was me.

6067
04:08:21,050 --> 04:08:21,890
Oh, that was Snake.

6068
04:08:23,310 --> 04:08:24,330
Snake, what are you doing?

6069
04:08:28,290 --> 04:08:29,070
There she goes.

6070
04:08:30,150 --> 04:08:31,150
Snake, you have any words?

6071
04:08:33,850 --> 04:08:35,890
Snake, you got any words for Emma?

6072
04:08:41,320 --> 04:08:42,360
Are there any claymores?

6073
04:08:42,440 --> 04:08:43,560
I think I got all of them.

6074
04:08:43,600 --> 04:08:45,600
But let's just check.

6075
04:08:48,720 --> 04:08:49,400
Let's check.

6076
04:08:49,860 --> 04:08:50,620
Oh, wait.

6077
04:08:50,660 --> 04:08:50,840
What's that?

6078
04:08:50,880 --> 04:08:51,260
That's a bird.

6079
04:08:54,540 --> 04:08:55,220
Yeah, we're good.

6080
04:08:55,400 --> 04:08:55,760
Oh, wait.

6081
04:08:55,760 --> 04:08:55,760
What's that?

6082
04:08:55,760 --> 04:08:55,860
See?

6083
04:08:56,400 --> 04:08:58,620
She'll make it in one piece.

6084
04:09:00,380 --> 04:09:01,200
She'll make it in one piece.

6085
04:09:01,200 --> 04:09:01,880
She'll be totally fine.

6086
04:09:02,740 --> 04:09:03,300
She'll be totally fine.

6087
04:09:03,300 --> 04:09:04,780
Oh, the sun is so bright.

6088
04:09:05,920 --> 04:09:07,280
Snake, you got any words?

6089
04:09:12,460 --> 04:09:14,040
Not bad at all.

6090
04:09:16,200 --> 04:09:17,340
What do you mean by that?

6091
04:09:19,020 --> 04:09:19,580
Phew.

6092
04:09:20,820 --> 04:09:21,380
Phew.

6093
04:09:22,600 --> 04:09:23,160
Snake!

6094
04:09:23,860 --> 04:09:24,240
Snake!

6095
04:09:30,260 --> 04:09:31,500
We both can't aim.

6096
04:09:31,560 --> 04:09:33,320
Snake, our aim is both bad.

6097
04:09:34,640 --> 04:09:36,940
Wish they'd give me more medicine.

6098
04:09:37,820 --> 04:09:39,160
Oh, you got it.

6099
04:09:39,240 --> 04:09:39,480
You're good.

6100
04:09:40,320 --> 04:09:41,220
You got it.

6101
04:09:43,180 --> 04:09:43,700
Phew.

6102
04:09:48,460 --> 04:09:48,980
Alright.

6103
04:09:49,340 --> 04:09:49,820
Alright.

6104
04:09:51,680 --> 04:09:53,140
We got this.

6105
04:09:53,220 --> 04:09:54,320
We got this.

6106
04:09:54,380 --> 04:09:55,980
Just a little more.

6107
04:09:56,360 --> 04:09:57,520
Not bad.

6108
04:09:58,500 --> 04:09:59,600
He was talking about me.

6109
04:09:59,780 --> 04:10:00,240
Snake.

6110
04:10:02,880 --> 04:10:04,380
I'm so sorry to tell you this.

6111
04:10:09,000 --> 04:10:10,740
I'm so sorry to tell you this.

6112
04:10:10,780 --> 04:10:11,200
I'm so sorry to tell you this, but...

6113
04:10:11,200 --> 04:10:11,520
I'm so sorry to tell you this, but...

6114
04:10:11,520 --> 04:10:11,540
Alright.

6115
04:10:12,360 --> 04:10:12,800
Yay!

6116
04:10:13,100 --> 04:10:13,580
We did it!

6117
04:10:16,600 --> 04:10:18,180
Doesn't he have a really gross line about...

6118
04:10:18,180 --> 04:10:18,480
He does.

6119
04:10:18,560 --> 04:10:20,520
He has like a line where he's just like...

6120
04:10:21,480 --> 04:10:23,200
I'd date her or something.

6121
04:10:23,640 --> 04:10:23,840
I'd date her or something.

6122
04:10:25,120 --> 04:10:26,340
Oh my god!

6123
04:10:26,380 --> 04:10:26,620
No!

6124
04:10:30,920 --> 04:10:32,040
Oh my god.

6125
04:10:32,040 --> 04:10:32,340
No!

6126
04:10:32,880 --> 04:10:33,360
Please!

6127
04:10:34,520 --> 04:10:35,000
No!

6128
04:10:35,160 --> 04:10:36,240
Why are you back?

6129
04:10:36,420 --> 04:10:36,680
Vamp!

6130
04:10:40,860 --> 04:10:41,600
Don't shake.

6131
04:10:41,760 --> 04:10:42,160
Don't shake.

6132
04:10:42,300 --> 04:10:42,660
Don't shake.

6133
04:10:42,900 --> 04:10:43,340
Just shoot!

6134
04:10:43,500 --> 04:10:44,040
You have him!

6135
04:10:44,120 --> 04:10:44,980
You have him in your crosshair!

6136
04:10:45,040 --> 04:10:45,200
Shoot!

6137
04:10:48,120 --> 04:10:48,600
Yay!

6138
04:10:48,740 --> 04:10:49,140
Vamp!

6139
04:10:49,640 --> 04:10:50,900
Send no one ever.

6140
04:10:51,020 --> 04:10:51,300
Wait.

6141
04:10:53,520 --> 04:10:54,120
Hold on!

6142
04:10:58,660 --> 04:10:59,440
She's like...

6143
04:10:59,440 --> 04:11:00,960
She's like joking.

6144
04:11:01,100 --> 04:11:01,780
I'm like...

6145
04:11:01,780 --> 04:11:02,340
Hold on!

6146
04:11:02,880 --> 04:11:03,660
One second!

6147
04:11:06,380 --> 04:11:07,160
One second!

6148
04:11:07,920 --> 04:11:08,640
One second!

6149
04:11:09,020 --> 04:11:09,780
One second!

6150
04:11:11,620 --> 04:11:12,580
I can't!

6151
04:11:14,340 --> 04:11:15,320
Oh, did I hit...

6152
04:11:21,730 --> 04:11:22,450
Oh my god.

6153
04:11:22,510 --> 04:11:23,110
Please, controller.

6154
04:11:30,230 --> 04:11:31,650
Bye forever, Vamp!

6155
04:11:31,990 --> 04:11:33,630
Never wanna see your ass again.

6156
04:11:34,030 --> 04:11:34,430
Please.

6157
04:11:36,450 --> 04:11:38,910
Emma, you good, girl?

6158
04:11:39,010 --> 04:11:39,430
You okay?

6159
04:11:40,810 --> 04:11:41,330
No!

6160
04:11:41,330 --> 04:11:42,670
No, Emma, Emma, Emma!

6161
04:11:43,830 --> 04:11:44,290
Emma!

6162
04:11:48,550 --> 04:11:49,530
It wasn't me!

6163
04:11:51,270 --> 04:11:52,510
I didn't shoot her.

6164
04:11:52,630 --> 04:11:53,030
I didn't...

6165
04:11:53,030 --> 04:11:54,610
I didn't shoot her.

6166
04:11:54,790 --> 04:11:55,990
No, I didn't shoot her.

6167
04:11:56,050 --> 04:11:56,550
I didn't...

6168
04:11:59,290 --> 04:12:00,570
Where was this aim?

6169
04:12:00,730 --> 04:12:01,870
Where was this aim before?

6170
04:12:03,610 --> 04:12:05,050
No, I didn't shoot her!

6171
04:12:05,630 --> 04:12:06,950
No, it wasn't me!

6172
04:12:08,230 --> 04:12:10,130
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.

6173
04:12:11,430 --> 04:12:11,830
Bandage!

6174
04:12:12,150 --> 04:12:12,890
Bandage, bandage!

6175
04:12:13,710 --> 04:12:14,110
Bandage!

6176
04:12:14,990 --> 04:12:15,990
It'll fix everything!

6177
04:12:16,490 --> 04:12:17,270
Stop the bleeding!

6178
04:12:18,230 --> 04:12:18,630
Pressure!

6179
04:12:18,670 --> 04:12:19,070
Something!

6180
04:12:21,190 --> 04:12:22,410
Don't pull out the bullet!

6181
04:12:22,490 --> 04:12:23,330
That I didn't shoot.

6182
04:12:25,210 --> 04:12:26,910
Raiden, you wanna get over there or something?

6183
04:12:27,690 --> 04:12:29,390
Raiden, you wanna make your way that direction?

6184
04:12:31,930 --> 04:12:32,950
Raiden, you wanna...

6185
04:12:39,810 --> 04:12:41,450
Let's just codec the situation.

6186
04:12:42,670 --> 04:12:44,190
Raiden, Emma's been stabbed.

6187
04:12:44,290 --> 04:12:44,850
Stabbed!

6188
04:12:44,990 --> 04:12:45,430
Bastard!

6189
04:12:45,470 --> 04:12:46,490
How bad is it?

6190
04:12:46,530 --> 04:12:47,310
She's conscious.

6191
04:12:47,550 --> 04:12:48,490
But the bleeding's bad.

6192
04:12:48,750 --> 04:12:50,610
I'm bringing her over there right now.

6193
04:12:51,930 --> 04:12:54,530
Raiden, get that disc over here as soon as possible.

6194
04:12:54,970 --> 04:12:55,250
Going to survival dealer.

6195
04:12:55,250 --> 04:12:56,810
I'm afraid her time's running out.

6196
04:12:56,890 --> 04:12:57,830
I'll be there.

6197
04:13:00,550 --> 04:13:03,610
These other guys can take missiles to the face.

6198
04:13:04,490 --> 04:13:05,050
But...

6199
04:13:06,390 --> 04:13:10,630
But one little stab stabby stab and that's it for her.

6200
04:13:11,070 --> 04:13:12,070
What's up with that?

6201
04:13:16,680 --> 04:13:18,020
Being stabbed hurts.

6202
04:13:18,220 --> 04:13:18,780
That hurts.

6203
04:13:19,900 --> 04:13:21,280
Emma took like 10 bullets.

6204
04:13:21,520 --> 04:13:21,900
I know!

6205
04:13:23,660 --> 04:13:25,580
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

6206
04:13:28,360 --> 04:13:29,940
Oh wait, isn't there a timer?

6207
04:13:30,080 --> 04:13:30,440
Wait.

6208
04:13:31,620 --> 04:13:33,420
Oh shoot, I forgot about this part.

6209
04:13:33,780 --> 04:13:35,780
Snake, what's your situation over there?

6210
04:13:36,000 --> 04:13:40,940
Emma seems to be doing something to G.W.'s defensive capabilities.

6211
04:13:41,440 --> 04:13:43,240
All we need now is your disc.

6212
04:13:43,520 --> 04:13:44,140
Okay, I'm on my way.

6213
04:13:44,180 --> 04:13:44,540
You better hurry.

6214
04:13:44,720 --> 04:13:46,100
I don't think she's gonna make it.

6215
04:13:46,360 --> 04:13:47,240
How's the bleeding?

6216
04:13:47,440 --> 04:13:49,520
But there's like guys I have to worry about too, isn't there?

6217
04:13:49,580 --> 04:13:50,100
Oh shoot.

6218
04:13:50,300 --> 04:13:51,560
Completely forgot.

6219
04:13:52,520 --> 04:13:53,540
Oh wait, actually?

6220
04:13:53,780 --> 04:13:54,180
Understood.

6221
04:13:54,840 --> 04:13:55,800
Oh, the coast is clear?

6222
04:13:57,160 --> 04:13:59,000
Wait, uh...

6223
04:13:59,480 --> 04:14:01,440
Snake, I see someone moving.

6224
04:14:01,600 --> 04:14:03,180
The coast does not appear to be clear.

6225
04:14:03,640 --> 04:14:04,280
I repeat!

6226
04:14:05,520 --> 04:14:07,740
I repeat, the coast does not appear to be clear!

6227
04:14:17,800 --> 04:14:18,860
Oh, it's this guy.

6228
04:14:19,900 --> 04:14:21,300
He's listening to his music.

6229
04:14:22,940 --> 04:14:23,380
Timer.

6230
04:14:44,640 --> 04:14:45,320
My bad, sorry.

6231
04:14:46,120 --> 04:14:46,920
Where am I going?

6232
04:14:50,480 --> 04:14:51,500
Snake, where am I going?

6233
04:14:51,540 --> 04:14:51,740
Sorry.

6234
04:14:53,900 --> 04:14:57,620
Raiden, we're in the computing room on B2 of Shell 1's core.

6235
04:14:58,360 --> 04:14:59,600
Emma's not doing so well.

6236
04:14:59,800 --> 04:15:00,900
Get over here as soon as you can.

6237
04:15:00,900 --> 04:15:01,820
I'm talking to this beautiful girl from Korea.

6238
04:15:02,340 --> 04:15:03,940
I think we might be sold.

6239
04:15:06,460 --> 04:15:08,520
B2 of Shell 1.

6240
04:15:08,660 --> 04:15:09,680
Now we're...

6241
04:15:10,700 --> 04:15:11,140
We're...

6242
04:15:11,760 --> 04:15:12,000
Wait.

6243
04:15:14,120 --> 04:15:14,520
Oh.

6244
04:15:15,160 --> 04:15:15,560
Oh.

6245
04:15:16,000 --> 04:15:16,400
B...

6246
04:15:17,700 --> 04:15:18,100
Oh!

6247
04:15:18,520 --> 04:15:19,300
Oh no!

6248
04:15:19,440 --> 04:15:19,780
Oh no!

6249
04:15:19,820 --> 04:15:20,180
Oh no!

6250
04:15:20,240 --> 04:15:20,500
Oh no!

6251
04:15:20,600 --> 04:15:20,980
Wait.

6252
04:15:21,280 --> 04:15:21,680
Huh.

6253
04:15:22,620 --> 04:15:23,020
Wait.

6254
04:15:23,480 --> 04:15:24,960
Which is... This is F.

6255
04:15:25,140 --> 04:15:25,720
Where's B?

6256
04:15:27,520 --> 04:15:28,800
Oh, B2 of Shell 1!

6257
04:15:28,860 --> 04:15:29,780
Okay, B2 of Shell 1.

6258
04:15:29,880 --> 04:15:30,240
Okay, sorry.

6259
04:15:30,340 --> 04:15:30,520
My bad.

6260
04:15:32,100 --> 04:15:33,460
Okay, B2 of Shell 1.

6261
04:15:46,000 --> 04:15:46,560
Hold on.

6262
04:15:46,820 --> 04:15:48,400
I think this guy is right here.

6263
04:15:49,140 --> 04:15:50,500
We have to wait for him to leave.

6264
04:15:51,880 --> 04:15:52,280
Okay.

6265
04:16:02,420 --> 04:16:03,600
He's jamming out!

6266
04:16:06,520 --> 04:16:06,920
Sorry.

6267
04:16:07,400 --> 04:16:08,080
Sorry, man.

6268
04:16:10,940 --> 04:16:11,340
Sorry.

6269
04:16:11,800 --> 04:16:12,200
Okay.

6270
04:16:12,340 --> 04:16:13,180
It's this way, right?

6271
04:16:13,940 --> 04:16:14,660
Oh my goodness.

6272
04:16:14,840 --> 04:16:15,320
Oh my goodness.

6273
04:16:15,700 --> 04:16:16,420
Oh my goodness.

6274
04:16:16,620 --> 04:16:17,020
Raiden!

6275
04:16:17,120 --> 04:16:18,820
Can you not get caught on everything?

6276
04:16:23,550 --> 04:16:25,150
I'll send you an invite to our wedding.

6277
04:16:25,330 --> 04:16:26,710
Okay, I'm looking forward to it.

6278
04:16:26,710 --> 04:16:28,670
Alright, bye.

6279
04:16:29,230 --> 04:16:30,070
Bye-bye!

6280
04:16:32,100 --> 04:16:32,880
Wrong way?

6281
04:16:35,400 --> 04:16:38,140
Arsenal's launch has initiated a security lockout.

6282
04:16:38,480 --> 04:16:41,760
Otakons managed to override anything that leads to the computing room.

6283
04:16:41,900 --> 04:16:43,940
This is no time to get sidetracked.

6284
04:16:44,120 --> 04:16:44,460
Hurry!

6285
04:16:44,880 --> 04:16:45,480
Sorry.

6286
04:16:45,660 --> 04:16:46,060
Sorry.

6287
04:16:46,100 --> 04:16:46,500
Sorry.

6288
04:16:46,700 --> 04:16:47,300
Sorry.

6289
04:16:47,580 --> 04:16:48,180
Sorry.

6290
04:16:48,820 --> 04:16:49,420
Sorry.

6291
04:16:50,160 --> 04:16:50,760
Wait.

6292
04:16:51,180 --> 04:16:51,360
Wait.

6293
04:16:51,360 --> 04:16:51,540
Wait.

6294
04:16:54,180 --> 04:16:54,780
Nice.

6295
04:16:55,480 --> 04:16:57,100
Box number five!

6296
04:16:57,540 --> 04:16:58,140
Hahaha.

6297
04:16:58,600 --> 04:16:59,520
Is it this way?

6298
04:17:01,760 --> 04:17:02,160
Okay.

6299
04:17:05,120 --> 04:17:06,540
I've never seen that code before.

6300
04:17:07,160 --> 04:17:08,120
Because I'm stupid.

6301
04:17:30,290 --> 04:17:31,090
Oh my god, please.

6302
04:17:31,290 --> 04:17:33,290
Oh, I had it, but the controller pressure.

6303
04:17:34,190 --> 04:17:34,810
There we go.

6304
04:17:35,370 --> 04:17:36,130
Oh my god.

6305
04:17:36,230 --> 04:17:36,830
Oh my god.

6306
04:17:37,430 --> 04:17:38,090
Oh my god.

6307
04:17:38,130 --> 04:17:38,490
Oh my god.

6308
04:17:39,470 --> 04:17:40,050
Got it.

6309
04:17:41,710 --> 04:17:42,110
Um...

6310
04:17:42,810 --> 04:17:44,550
Anything else that I should be worried about?

6311
04:17:45,310 --> 04:17:47,430
Oh shoot, I have to go back through this thing.

6312
04:17:51,530 --> 04:17:51,930
Uh...

6313
04:17:54,190 --> 04:17:54,670
Hut!

6314
04:17:55,770 --> 04:17:57,330
La-la-la-la-la.

6315
04:17:57,330 --> 04:17:58,470
Level two grip strength!

6316
04:17:59,650 --> 04:18:01,490
La-la-la-la-la-la.

6317
04:18:01,490 --> 04:18:03,170
La-la-la-la-la-la.

6318
04:18:03,170 --> 04:18:04,170
La-la-la-la-la-la.

6319
04:18:04,170 --> 04:18:04,730
La-la-la-la-la.

6320
04:18:05,490 --> 04:18:07,610
The coast has never been clearer.

6321
04:18:07,950 --> 04:18:08,270
Hahaha.

6322
04:18:10,070 --> 04:18:12,150
B2, we gotta go see our little bird.

6323
04:18:12,390 --> 04:18:13,310
I don't know why.

6324
04:18:13,490 --> 04:18:14,650
I think if he had said...

6325
04:18:14,650 --> 04:18:16,070
He did say the computer room, right?

6326
04:18:16,510 --> 04:18:18,350
My brain is just a little silly.

6327
04:18:19,170 --> 04:18:20,550
I was like, where is that?

6328
04:18:21,970 --> 04:18:22,450
Okay.

6329
04:18:24,470 --> 04:18:24,950
Alright.

6330
04:18:25,490 --> 04:18:25,970
Alright.

6331
04:18:25,970 --> 04:18:28,490
And it's clear in here, right?

6332
04:18:31,250 --> 04:18:31,730
Oh

6333
04:18:56,040 --> 04:18:57,100
my god, my eyes.

6334
04:18:57,280 --> 04:18:57,920
My eyes.

6335
04:19:00,080 --> 04:19:01,140
Ugh, my eyes.

6336
04:19:04,540 --> 04:19:05,800
Get it together, Raiden.

6337
04:19:06,300 --> 04:19:07,680
How could you not have seen those?

6338
04:19:08,200 --> 04:19:11,100
Can you imagine if it did the whole cutscene with the thermal goggles on?

6339
04:19:12,860 --> 04:19:13,580
Oh no.

6340
04:19:13,580 --> 04:19:13,900
Oh no.

6341
04:19:14,480 --> 04:19:15,240
Oh no.

6342
04:19:19,980 --> 04:19:21,440
Punished for getting sidetracked.

6343
04:19:24,640 --> 04:19:26,020
This game is such a troll.

6344
04:19:26,580 --> 04:19:28,180
This game is such a troll.

6345
04:19:28,300 --> 04:19:31,740
Gosh, Raiden, your hips are whack in this game.

6346
04:19:32,420 --> 04:19:33,160
How's Emma?

6347
04:19:34,100 --> 04:19:36,040
I think he got some internal organs.

6348
04:19:36,280 --> 04:19:37,720
We can't stop the bleeding.

6349
04:19:47,210 --> 04:19:47,690
How?

6350
04:19:50,350 --> 04:19:51,050
I'm here.

6351
04:19:52,650 --> 04:19:53,570
Got the disc.

6352
04:19:54,750 --> 04:19:56,950
He's trying to be quiet.

6353
04:19:57,050 --> 04:19:58,530
To, like, be respectful.

6354
04:19:58,530 --> 04:19:59,510
Emma set everything up.

6355
04:20:00,030 --> 04:20:02,190
Apparently all you have to do is pop in the disc.

6356
04:20:05,190 --> 04:20:07,150
Otacon, stop loving women.

6357
04:20:07,410 --> 04:20:07,890
Okay.

6358
04:20:09,710 --> 04:20:10,190
Ugh.

6359
04:20:10,190 --> 04:20:12,730
That should insert the virus into the AI.

6360
04:20:13,090 --> 04:20:13,950
Is it working?

6361
04:20:14,970 --> 04:20:16,230
Just leave it to Emma.

6362
04:20:18,910 --> 04:20:19,550
Uh oh.

6363
04:20:19,650 --> 04:20:20,470
Uh oh.

6364
04:20:20,510 --> 04:20:21,030
Uh oh.

6365
04:20:21,230 --> 04:20:22,710
An antibody agent?

6366
04:20:23,950 --> 04:20:24,930
Wow, this is...

6367
04:20:25,890 --> 04:20:26,410
Damn.

6368
04:20:26,670 --> 04:20:27,950
The connection's been cut.

6369
04:20:28,130 --> 04:20:29,850
Is the virus upload complete?

6370
04:20:30,070 --> 04:20:30,830
I don't think so.

6371
04:20:30,970 --> 04:20:32,550
The count stopped at 90%.

6372
04:20:33,650 --> 04:20:34,170
Otacon.

6373
04:20:34,350 --> 04:20:35,770
I don't think Emma's made any mistakes.

6374
04:20:36,190 --> 04:20:40,170
But a portion of the worm cluster might have been altered after the disc left Emma.

6375
04:20:40,190 --> 04:20:41,070
Uh oh.

6376
04:20:41,470 --> 04:20:42,730
By the Patriots?

6377
04:20:42,870 --> 04:20:44,550
Will the virus still work?

6378
04:20:46,170 --> 04:20:47,530
I have no idea.

6379
04:20:48,650 --> 04:20:49,790
Shadow clone.

6380
04:20:52,510 --> 04:20:54,190
Hal, is...

6381
04:20:57,640 --> 04:20:59,320
Is everything alright?

6382
04:21:05,600 --> 04:21:07,300
Snake is so sweet.

6383
04:21:07,320 --> 04:21:07,880
Everything's alright.

6384
04:21:08,620 --> 04:21:09,420
Good.

6385
04:21:11,940 --> 04:21:12,320
At least I...

6386
04:21:12,320 --> 04:21:18,260
I won't be adding another page to our family's dark history.

6387
04:21:19,620 --> 04:21:20,960
Yeah, that's right.

6388
04:21:26,540 --> 04:21:28,240
What if the virus doesn't work?

6389
04:21:28,440 --> 04:21:31,860
I either destroy that thing or take out Solidus and his men.

6390
04:21:32,120 --> 04:21:33,360
How do we get on board?

6391
04:21:33,940 --> 04:21:35,340
Don't be so loud, Ryland.

6392
04:21:35,480 --> 04:21:36,360
I don't think we can.

6393
04:21:37,520 --> 04:21:40,160
Unless somebody inside gives us a hand.

6394
04:21:40,500 --> 04:21:40,720
Mmm.

6395
04:21:41,240 --> 04:21:42,120
The bird.

6396
04:21:42,120 --> 04:21:43,120
Hal...

6397
04:21:45,480 --> 04:21:46,160
I...

6398
04:21:47,440 --> 04:21:48,800
I always...

6399
04:21:48,800 --> 04:21:49,500
What is it?

6400
04:21:52,640 --> 04:21:54,100
Hated your glasses.

6401
04:21:59,260 --> 04:22:01,120
Wanted to see you again.

6402
04:22:04,400 --> 04:22:05,080
Oh.

6403
04:22:05,080 --> 04:22:05,960
Music bit.

6404
04:22:06,020 --> 04:22:06,360
There we go.

6405
04:22:08,440 --> 04:22:09,460
You don't hate me?

6406
04:22:10,540 --> 04:22:11,220
Never.

6407
04:22:12,060 --> 04:22:14,420
I never wanted to get in your way.

6408
04:22:15,940 --> 04:22:18,220
I never wanted to hurt you.

6409
04:22:20,330 --> 04:22:21,670
That was Arsenal.

6410
04:22:22,010 --> 04:22:26,830
If I followed in your footsteps, I could be closer.

6411
04:22:29,490 --> 04:22:32,310
I just wanted you to look at me.

6412
04:22:32,550 --> 04:22:34,090
Look at me as...

6413
04:22:34,090 --> 04:22:34,730
As?

6414
04:22:34,890 --> 04:22:35,970
As a woman.

6415
04:22:36,390 --> 04:22:39,690
I could never do that.

6416
04:22:40,010 --> 04:22:41,210
Don't be so honest.

6417
04:22:41,210 --> 04:22:41,330
Please.

6418
04:22:42,750 --> 04:22:43,310
Please.

6419
04:22:44,450 --> 04:22:45,010
Sorry.

6420
04:22:46,970 --> 04:22:47,890
Can I...

6421
04:22:47,890 --> 04:22:50,770
Can I ask you one last favor?

6422
04:22:51,050 --> 04:22:51,550
Sure.

6423
04:22:51,850 --> 04:22:52,590
Oh god.

6424
04:22:52,790 --> 04:22:54,810
Call me Emma.

6425
04:22:56,950 --> 04:22:57,230
What?

6426
04:22:57,850 --> 04:22:59,670
Please call me Emma.

6427
04:22:59,870 --> 04:23:01,410
Why is that such a weird request, Hal?

6428
04:23:01,950 --> 04:23:02,830
Otacon, please.

6429
04:23:03,390 --> 04:23:04,210
Oh god.

6430
04:23:14,380 --> 04:23:15,480
I'm already in pain.

6431
04:23:17,400 --> 04:23:19,160
What's wrong with E.E.?

6432
04:23:20,920 --> 04:23:21,680
Otacon,

6433
04:23:25,020 --> 04:23:25,280
you!

6434
04:23:26,180 --> 04:23:26,940
Emma?

6435
04:23:30,080 --> 04:23:30,840
Emma?

6436
04:23:31,080 --> 04:23:31,760
Emma?

6437
04:23:34,140 --> 04:23:35,360
Oh god.

6438
04:23:35,620 --> 04:23:36,120
Answer me.

6439
04:23:37,600 --> 04:23:38,360
Bruh.

6440
04:23:38,360 --> 04:23:39,340
Oh god.

6441
04:23:39,480 --> 04:23:40,760
It's just so painful.

6442
04:23:45,360 --> 04:23:46,120
He

6443
04:23:50,460 --> 04:23:51,480
doesn't like to...

6444
04:23:53,020 --> 04:23:53,680
Otacon cries.

6445
04:24:02,780 --> 04:24:07,140
Every woman in this game series must suffer because of Otacon.

6446
04:24:09,120 --> 04:24:10,800
Oh god.

6447
04:24:12,860 --> 04:24:14,180
I didn't...

6448
04:24:14,660 --> 04:24:16,980
I didn't leave you.

6449
04:24:19,780 --> 04:24:21,460
Because of the accident.

6450
04:24:21,760 --> 04:24:23,020
I had...

6451
04:24:23,020 --> 04:24:25,720
I had a relationship with your mother.

6452
04:24:26,700 --> 04:24:27,540
Ugh.

6453
04:24:29,000 --> 04:24:30,040
She seduced me.

6454
04:24:32,200 --> 04:24:34,260
What's wrong with the dying girl?

6455
04:24:38,080 --> 04:24:40,340
My father's death was no accident.

6456
04:24:40,620 --> 04:24:40,820
Good.

6457
04:24:41,260 --> 04:24:42,700
He took his own life.

6458
04:24:43,120 --> 04:24:43,680
Coward.

6459
04:24:44,120 --> 04:24:45,460
It was my fault.

6460
04:24:45,580 --> 04:24:46,600
All my fault.

6461
04:24:46,860 --> 04:24:47,000
No.

6462
04:24:47,580 --> 04:24:49,180
Forgive me, Emma.

6463
04:24:50,520 --> 04:24:54,460
The world doesn't need Huey.

6464
04:24:55,120 --> 04:24:56,820
The world doesn't need your father.

6465
04:24:56,820 --> 04:24:58,140
Father's a...

6466
04:24:58,820 --> 04:25:00,260
Poopy dookie hen.

6467
04:25:02,000 --> 04:25:02,880
Oh god.

6468
04:25:03,400 --> 04:25:04,060
Ahhhh.

6469
04:25:04,320 --> 04:25:05,160
Not the bird.

6470
04:25:09,240 --> 04:25:12,200
It's the bird that makes me cry.

6471
04:25:12,820 --> 04:25:13,380
It's the bird that makes me cry.

6472
04:25:13,380 --> 04:25:18,740
It's the bird that makes me cry.

6473
04:25:18,740 --> 04:25:19,680
Love me some Huey hate.

6474
04:25:19,880 --> 04:25:20,680
Oh yeah, baby.

6475
04:25:23,360 --> 04:25:24,540
Oh, the bird.

6476
04:25:25,700 --> 04:25:26,360
Oh.

6477
04:25:27,320 --> 04:25:27,980
Howl.

6478
04:25:28,060 --> 04:25:28,720
Howl.

6479
04:25:28,720 --> 04:25:29,440
I miss you.

6480
04:25:29,980 --> 04:25:30,420
Howl.

6481
04:25:48,640 --> 04:25:49,080
Attention.

6482
04:25:49,680 --> 04:25:51,260
Arsenal gear is ready for launch.

6483
04:25:51,700 --> 04:25:53,120
Inoculate the upper levels immediately.

6484
04:25:54,300 --> 04:25:56,120
Sounds like they're cutting this area loose.

6485
04:25:56,600 --> 04:25:57,360
What do you mean?

6486
04:25:57,820 --> 04:25:59,340
It means we're gonna sink.

6487
04:25:59,620 --> 04:26:01,360
We have to get the hostages out.

6488
04:26:01,540 --> 04:26:02,680
What about the Kama repairs?

6489
04:26:03,240 --> 04:26:03,480
Done.

6490
04:26:03,680 --> 04:26:05,180
We won't be able to get everybody aboard.

6491
04:26:05,540 --> 04:26:07,240
We'll just have to take as many as we can.

6492
04:26:07,460 --> 04:26:08,260
My sister...

6493
04:26:08,260 --> 04:26:08,980
...

6494
04:26:12,750 --> 04:26:14,410
...Won't be able to come with us.

6495
04:26:14,550 --> 04:26:15,510
I'll save you.

6496
04:26:15,790 --> 04:26:17,930
We will be commencing the countdown shortly.

6497
04:26:18,170 --> 04:26:21,210
Personnel in the upper levels, head for the evacuation area immediately.

6498
04:26:28,500 --> 04:26:29,420
That sound?

6499
04:26:29,620 --> 04:26:31,200
I know it's a wolf but it gets me everytime.

6500
04:26:32,400 --> 04:26:34,100
I am always the survivor.

6501
04:26:34,560 --> 04:26:35,440
God, oh da god.

6502
04:26:37,600 --> 04:26:38,620
Why, Wolf?

6503
04:26:38,980 --> 04:26:39,400
Ya...

6504
04:26:39,400 --> 04:26:39,960
...

6505
04:26:40,640 --> 04:26:41,120
..

6506
04:26:44,900 --> 04:26:46,040
Oh my god.

6507
04:26:48,100 --> 04:26:50,280
Make me cry every time.

6508
04:26:53,420 --> 04:26:54,100
Wait.

6509
04:26:54,620 --> 04:26:55,460
It's okay.

6510
04:27:14,540 --> 04:27:14,920
We've got hours.

6511
04:27:16,020 --> 04:27:19,060
You mean, I'd only get in your way?

6512
04:27:19,180 --> 04:27:19,480
No.

6513
04:27:19,860 --> 04:27:20,380
Wrong.

6514
04:27:20,900 --> 04:27:23,280
Only you can save those hostages.

6515
04:27:23,480 --> 04:27:24,120
You got it?

6516
04:27:28,100 --> 04:27:28,620
Right.

6517
04:27:29,060 --> 04:27:32,960
Listen, the two of you won't be able to destroy that thing.

6518
04:27:35,600 --> 04:27:36,520
Eliminate the enemy.

6519
04:27:36,620 --> 04:27:37,620
That's your only option.

6520
04:27:40,400 --> 04:27:40,920
Yeah!

6521
04:27:45,060 --> 04:27:45,580
Boys!

6522
04:27:48,020 --> 04:27:48,580
Yeah!

6523
04:27:52,960 --> 04:27:53,520
Yeah!

6524
04:27:55,080 --> 04:27:56,200
Oh my god.

6525
04:27:57,060 --> 04:27:59,700
As long as that bird stays quiet, we are good.

6526
04:28:20,120 --> 04:28:21,960
He needs support, Snake.

6527
04:28:22,160 --> 04:28:22,560
He needs...

6528
04:28:22,560 --> 04:28:23,060
Leave it to me.

6529
04:28:23,260 --> 04:28:23,940
He needs support.

6530
04:28:24,680 --> 04:28:25,260
Yeah!

6531
04:28:32,520 --> 04:28:33,100
No!

6532
04:28:35,440 --> 04:28:36,020
No!

6533
04:28:37,160 --> 04:28:37,160
Get

6534
04:28:50,430 --> 04:28:52,290
out of here.

6535
04:28:52,810 --> 04:28:53,990
Oh my god.

6536
04:28:55,790 --> 04:28:56,370
Ow.

6537
04:28:57,070 --> 04:28:58,150
I miss you.

6538
04:28:59,750 --> 04:29:00,330
Ow.

6539
04:29:00,330 --> 04:29:02,270
I miss you.

6540
04:29:05,570 --> 04:29:07,570
The bird is a paid actor.

6541
04:29:07,870 --> 04:29:08,370
I miss you.

6542
04:29:09,650 --> 04:29:11,490
You said other things.

6543
04:29:11,490 --> 04:29:12,870
You said other things earlier.

6544
04:29:13,050 --> 04:29:13,730
I heard them.

6545
04:29:16,870 --> 04:29:18,590
This bird is so goofy.

6546
04:29:21,870 --> 04:29:23,650
It's so sad and so goofy.

6547
04:29:30,330 --> 04:29:31,730
He's like, I'm out of here.

6548
04:29:33,650 --> 04:29:34,890
You and me.

6549
04:29:35,870 --> 04:29:37,110
We're the same.

6550
04:29:37,510 --> 04:29:38,370
We're the same.

6551
04:29:40,590 --> 04:29:41,250
Gosh.

6552
04:29:43,750 --> 04:29:45,910
I'm getting emotional whiplash here.

6553
04:29:46,110 --> 04:29:46,930
I'm getting emotional whiplash here.

6554
04:29:46,930 --> 04:29:47,850
Both you and I.

6555
04:29:48,270 --> 04:29:50,450
We were always alone.

6556
04:29:50,850 --> 04:29:51,790
That is Otacon.

6557
04:29:52,050 --> 04:29:53,130
He's a simp.

6558
04:29:54,470 --> 04:29:56,970
Really appreciate how much Snake cares for Otacon.

6559
04:29:57,450 --> 04:29:58,850
Really appreciate how much Snake cares for Otacon.

6560
04:29:59,470 --> 04:30:00,270
He does.

6561
04:30:00,430 --> 04:30:01,630
Snake's a really good person.

6562
04:30:01,670 --> 04:30:02,190
Waiting for somebody.

6563
04:30:04,310 --> 04:30:06,170
Somebody who would love us.

6564
04:30:06,350 --> 04:30:07,450
But we were wrong.

6565
04:30:08,710 --> 04:30:10,750
You can't wait to be loved.

6566
04:30:12,390 --> 04:30:14,510
You have to go out and find it.

6567
04:30:14,610 --> 04:30:15,150
You have to go out and find it.

6568
04:30:15,150 --> 04:30:15,910
Go out and find it.

6569
04:30:15,910 --> 04:30:21,130
Four years ago, I realized that you can't just wish for a happy family.

6570
04:30:21,230 --> 04:30:21,330
Four years ago, I realized that you can't just wish for a happy family.

6571
04:30:21,330 --> 04:30:22,750
You have to make it happen.

6572
04:30:22,990 --> 04:30:23,930
Now you have one.

6573
04:30:24,290 --> 04:30:26,090
I only wish I knew that sooner.

6574
04:30:26,350 --> 04:30:27,850
Now you have a happy family.

6575
04:30:28,850 --> 04:30:29,750
I learned that I could love.

6576
04:30:31,170 --> 04:30:32,710
As you probably did.

6577
04:30:36,550 --> 04:30:37,770
Emotional damage break.

6578
04:30:39,250 --> 04:30:41,230
I'm loving your playthrough of the MGS franchise.

6579
04:30:42,190 --> 04:30:43,410
Only one I've never played it.

6580
04:30:43,490 --> 04:30:44,030
Is Floor.

6581
04:30:44,030 --> 04:30:44,970
You think he's gonna be okay?

6582
04:30:46,150 --> 04:30:47,650
You can watch us play Floor then.

6583
04:30:48,090 --> 04:30:48,270
He's tougher than he looks.

6584
04:30:48,850 --> 04:30:49,830
Consider it done.

6585
04:30:49,950 --> 04:30:51,250
Our shows are so entertaining.

6586
04:30:51,750 --> 04:30:53,150
Now, how do we open this thing?

6587
04:30:54,550 --> 04:30:56,050
You can come out now.

6588
04:30:57,370 --> 04:30:58,110
Oh my god!

6589
04:30:58,850 --> 04:30:59,050
Ninja!

6590
04:30:59,510 --> 04:31:00,770
A ninja?

6591
04:31:05,750 --> 04:31:07,150
Oh my god!

6592
04:31:11,870 --> 04:31:12,470
No!

6593
04:31:12,950 --> 04:31:14,130
Snake, what's this all about?

6594
04:31:14,750 --> 04:31:16,010
Time to go night-night.

6595
04:31:16,310 --> 04:31:17,090
Bedtime riding.

6596
04:31:18,110 --> 04:31:19,830
How do you do that?

6597
04:31:20,110 --> 04:31:21,450
Nighty-night riding.

6598
04:31:21,890 --> 04:31:23,190
You're changing sides now?

6599
04:31:23,630 --> 04:31:24,570
Change sides?

6600
04:31:25,010 --> 04:31:26,790
I don't recall saying I was on yours.

6601
04:31:26,790 --> 04:31:29,070
Damn it.

6602
04:31:29,070 --> 04:31:29,650
Snake!

6603
04:31:31,350 --> 04:31:32,410
Who's the ninja?

6604
04:31:32,550 --> 04:31:33,210
Who's the ninja?

6605
04:31:34,350 --> 04:31:35,190
Gray Fox!

6606
04:31:38,530 --> 04:31:39,150
Sea Woman!

6607
04:31:41,390 --> 04:31:42,890
Oh god girl!

6608
04:31:42,930 --> 04:31:43,430
Look over here!

6609
04:31:45,390 --> 04:31:45,990
Oh

6610
04:31:49,380 --> 04:31:49,580
god!

6611
04:31:49,740 --> 04:31:51,800
She's been working with Snake the whole time!

6612
04:31:55,200 --> 04:31:57,160
Gray Fox Sea Woman.

6613
04:32:00,180 --> 04:32:00,860
Hmm mm!

6614
04:32:03,360 --> 04:32:06,280
We get quite a few cuts here and now.

6615
04:32:06,460 --> 04:32:07,520
If I remember correctly.

6616
04:32:11,880 --> 04:32:15,420
O-O-Ohhh, aaaaah!

6617
04:32:16,200 --> 04:32:16,740
Oh

6618
04:32:24,150 --> 04:32:26,710
no, Titanic Reel!!

6619
04:32:37,120 --> 04:32:37,900
Oh ho ho!

6620
04:32:38,420 --> 04:32:40,100
Good job Otacon, good job!

6621
04:32:41,020 --> 04:32:42,500
He did his job well!

6622
04:32:48,890 --> 04:32:49,710
Hmmmm mmm mmm

6623
04:32:55,010 --> 04:32:56,630
Jack, are you reading me?

6624
04:32:56,770 --> 04:32:59,510
Do you want to save your mission data up to this point?

6625
04:32:59,790 --> 04:33:00,370
I do.

6626
04:33:00,670 --> 04:33:01,550
Thank you, Rose.

6627
04:33:05,050 --> 04:33:07,010
But, it's... it's Raiden.

6628
04:33:12,730 --> 04:33:15,990
Oh, he saved Meryl, not Otacon in MGS1?

6629
04:33:16,150 --> 04:33:16,690
How is he alive?

6630
04:33:16,970 --> 04:33:18,270
Your mission data has been saved.

6631
04:33:19,030 --> 04:33:20,730
You know, he got out.

6632
04:33:23,370 --> 04:33:24,670
Is he still alive?

6633
04:33:25,410 --> 04:33:27,410
He was when Otacon brought him here.

6634
04:33:28,010 --> 04:33:29,810
This is just like MGS1!

6635
04:33:29,990 --> 04:33:32,730
I checked everything, including the genome data, but there's nothing on this guy.

6636
04:33:34,130 --> 04:33:34,650
NSA...

6637
04:33:34,650 --> 04:33:35,270
I'm just a guy!

6638
04:33:36,030 --> 04:33:36,550
FBI...

6639
04:33:37,150 --> 04:33:38,570
Check my bloodstream.

6640
04:33:38,730 --> 04:33:39,250
He doesn't exist in any database.

6641
04:33:39,250 --> 04:33:40,510
It's got gunpowder in it.

6642
04:33:40,970 --> 04:33:44,750
He's a non-existent operative from a non-existent organization.

6643
04:33:45,330 --> 04:33:46,930
I suspected as much.

6644
04:33:47,070 --> 04:33:48,710
However, I know this man.

6645
04:33:48,910 --> 04:33:49,450
You know me?

6646
04:33:50,690 --> 04:33:51,670
Wake him up.

6647
04:33:52,170 --> 04:33:54,650
I thought he was dead.

6648
04:33:54,670 --> 04:33:55,350
I thought he was going to slap me.

6649
04:34:00,930 --> 04:34:02,970
The parallels, I know, right?

6650
04:34:03,350 --> 04:34:06,210
A lot of things have been quite similar to MGS1.

6651
04:34:06,490 --> 04:34:07,170
It's kind of crazy.

6652
04:34:10,930 --> 04:34:11,810
Solid-S!

6653
04:34:13,030 --> 04:34:14,870
It's been a while, hasn't it?

6654
04:34:15,090 --> 04:34:15,910
Kisachi booty.

6655
04:34:15,930 --> 04:34:16,730
Jack the Ripper.

6656
04:34:19,330 --> 04:34:19,890
Huh?

6657
04:34:20,530 --> 04:34:21,090
Okay.

6658
04:34:21,730 --> 04:34:23,210
You know this fellow?

6659
04:34:23,850 --> 04:34:24,410
Fellow?

6660
04:34:24,810 --> 04:34:26,410
You remember me, don't you?

6661
04:34:26,990 --> 04:34:27,870
You've grown.

6662
04:34:31,330 --> 04:34:34,030
By concentration of cerebral implants.

6663
04:34:34,490 --> 04:34:36,670
Have they altered your memory, too?

6664
04:34:47,380 --> 04:34:49,780
It's time for Jack to let her rip.

6665
04:34:54,480 --> 04:34:57,540
Look at the eight pack he's got going on.

6666
04:34:58,520 --> 04:35:00,100
This is my son.

6667
04:35:00,860 --> 04:35:01,480
Huh?

6668
04:35:01,480 --> 04:35:02,840
I taught him everything.

6669
04:35:03,160 --> 04:35:04,200
This is my son?

6670
04:35:06,800 --> 04:35:08,180
Oh, my God.

6671
04:35:08,220 --> 04:35:08,840
The eye patch.

6672
04:35:09,900 --> 04:35:10,500
Solidus.

6673
04:35:10,700 --> 04:35:11,300
Jack.

6674
04:35:12,000 --> 04:35:14,260
I never thought I'd see you again.

6675
04:35:16,420 --> 04:35:17,980
You know me?

6676
04:35:19,360 --> 04:35:20,580
You don't remember.

6677
04:35:20,880 --> 04:35:21,460
Oh, my God.

6678
04:35:21,620 --> 04:35:22,200
Your name.

6679
04:35:22,380 --> 04:35:23,060
Your skills.

6680
04:35:24,100 --> 04:35:26,720
Everything you know, you learn from me.

6681
04:35:27,740 --> 04:35:28,340
What?

6682
04:35:29,300 --> 04:35:30,500
Show me.

6683
04:35:30,520 --> 04:35:30,760
Show me.

6684
04:35:30,760 --> 04:35:30,960
Show me.

6685
04:35:30,960 --> 04:35:31,400
Show me.

6686
04:35:31,400 --> 04:35:31,420
Show me.

6687
04:35:31,420 --> 04:35:31,460
Show me.

6688
04:35:31,460 --> 04:35:32,940
The eighties.

6689
04:35:33,820 --> 04:35:35,100
A civil war.

6690
04:35:36,460 --> 04:35:40,680
You were one of the best among the child soldiers that fought in that conflict.

6691
04:35:40,880 --> 04:35:41,480
Oh, my God.

6692
04:35:41,600 --> 04:35:42,740
Right in the child soldier.

6693
04:35:42,800 --> 04:35:47,280
When you were barely ten years old, you became the platoon leader of the small boy unit.

6694
04:35:48,160 --> 04:35:55,400
At the time, your outstanding kill record earned you several nicknames, including White Devil and Jack the Ripper.

6695
04:35:55,560 --> 04:35:55,680
Whoa.

6696
04:35:56,020 --> 04:35:56,960
White Mamba.

6697
04:35:57,440 --> 04:35:57,960
Jack.

6698
04:35:57,960 --> 04:35:59,100
I was your godfather.

6699
04:35:59,260 --> 04:35:59,920
Oh, my God.

6700
04:35:59,920 --> 04:36:00,480
I named you.

6701
04:36:00,580 --> 04:36:01,100
Little baby.

6702
04:36:01,380 --> 04:36:03,840
When the war ended, you disappeared from the relief center.

6703
04:36:05,580 --> 04:36:07,460
I wondered what happened to you.

6704
04:36:07,540 --> 04:36:08,060
Small boy.

6705
04:36:08,100 --> 04:36:10,060
I should have known they would recruit you.

6706
04:36:10,560 --> 04:36:11,680
Dun dun dun.

6707
04:36:18,440 --> 04:36:20,040
It's an interesting coincidence.

6708
04:36:20,760 --> 04:36:24,020
If he's a lackey for the Patriots, I doubt he knows anything of interest.

6709
04:36:25,380 --> 04:36:27,100
What should we do with him?

6710
04:36:27,560 --> 04:36:28,400
Strip him down.

6711
04:36:28,600 --> 04:36:30,520
We'll use him like you suggested.

6712
04:36:30,880 --> 04:36:30,980
Oh.

6713
04:36:32,240 --> 04:36:33,600
What about Dead Cell?

6714
04:36:34,840 --> 04:36:35,520
Ignore them.

6715
04:36:36,320 --> 04:36:37,020
Dead Cell?

6716
04:36:37,020 --> 04:36:37,260
Oh.

6717
04:36:37,480 --> 04:36:37,980
Oh.

6718
04:36:38,160 --> 04:36:38,940
Oh, my God.

6719
04:36:40,380 --> 04:36:42,040
Dead Cell's basically dead.

6720
04:36:43,180 --> 04:36:44,500
All that's left is Fortune.

6721
04:36:44,660 --> 04:36:45,080
Happening again?

6722
04:36:46,200 --> 04:36:48,460
Could it be that he's here, too?

6723
04:36:49,860 --> 04:36:50,360
Liquid.

6724
04:36:51,920 --> 04:36:53,300
He's already stripped down.

6725
04:36:53,480 --> 04:36:56,020
In another hour, we demonstrate the power of Arsenal gear.

6726
04:36:56,400 --> 04:36:56,940
Oh, my God.

6727
04:36:56,960 --> 04:36:58,680
Attack with standard weapons, of course.

6728
04:36:58,980 --> 04:36:59,420
Yes.

6729
04:36:59,540 --> 04:37:00,340
Proceed as planned.

6730
04:37:00,720 --> 04:37:01,080
Nice.

6731
04:37:01,080 --> 04:37:02,780
At last, report all is well with GW.

6732
04:37:03,860 --> 04:37:04,360
Hmm.

6733
04:37:04,560 --> 04:37:04,820
Oh, my God.

6734
04:37:04,820 --> 04:37:05,900
How about the troops?

6735
04:37:06,660 --> 04:37:07,100
Arsenal.

6736
04:37:07,200 --> 04:37:07,580
It looks like he's skimming something.

6737
04:37:07,580 --> 04:37:10,200
The men are being refitted with Arsenal gear equipment as ordered.

6738
04:37:16,790 --> 04:37:18,970
You're the spitting image of Big Boss.

6739
04:37:19,150 --> 04:37:21,690
So, Solidus was doing all this while Venom was building a zoo?

6740
04:37:25,010 --> 04:37:25,450
Yeah.

6741
04:37:25,510 --> 04:37:25,970
I guess you're right.

6742
04:37:26,310 --> 04:37:26,750
Well...

6743
04:37:26,750 --> 04:37:27,330
Is that so?

6744
04:37:28,370 --> 04:37:30,990
Perhaps I should be grateful to this kid for that.

6745
04:37:30,990 --> 04:37:31,410
I guess so.

6746
04:37:35,690 --> 04:37:37,230
It's funny because Solidus is...

6747
04:37:37,230 --> 04:37:38,310
This is the youngest sibling.

6748
04:37:38,630 --> 04:37:40,670
And we know how old Eli is.

6749
04:37:40,870 --> 04:37:43,950
This situation, I find it very nostalgic.

6750
04:37:45,610 --> 04:37:46,850
Where am I?

6751
04:37:47,330 --> 04:37:49,450
Why, inside Arsenal gear, of course.

6752
04:37:49,530 --> 04:37:51,630
This time, he had to take his pants off, though.

6753
04:37:51,690 --> 04:37:54,870
Actually, we're also inside the memory of Shadow Moses.

6754
04:37:55,330 --> 04:37:55,650
What?

6755
04:37:56,890 --> 04:37:57,990
What do you mean by that?

6756
04:37:59,910 --> 04:38:01,090
I'll take this back.

6757
04:38:01,350 --> 04:38:01,630
No.

6758
04:38:01,670 --> 04:38:03,090
You don't need this anymore, do you?

6759
04:38:03,350 --> 04:38:03,770
Dang it.

6760
04:38:04,070 --> 04:38:04,810
Oh, it's a lot.

6761
04:38:06,230 --> 04:38:06,710
Liquid.

6762
04:38:06,870 --> 04:38:07,210
Oh, my God.

6763
04:38:07,210 --> 04:38:08,210
Oh, God.

6764
04:38:08,370 --> 04:38:09,230
She'll get us out.

6765
04:38:09,250 --> 04:38:10,190
She doesn't want to look at her.

6766
04:38:10,290 --> 04:38:10,970
A foul wind is blowing.

6767
04:38:11,290 --> 04:38:12,730
We shall speak again.

6768
04:38:12,990 --> 04:38:14,490
A foul wind is blowing.

6769
04:38:14,510 --> 04:38:14,890
Sorry.

6770
04:38:16,890 --> 04:38:17,730
It's Johnny.

6771
04:38:19,610 --> 04:38:20,310
Don't move.

6772
04:38:20,910 --> 04:38:22,010
Stay as you are.

6773
04:38:22,070 --> 04:38:22,430
Okay.

6774
04:38:22,650 --> 04:38:24,370
We're being monitored by a camera.

6775
04:38:24,570 --> 04:38:24,830
Okay.

6776
04:38:25,210 --> 04:38:26,410
What are you up to?

6777
04:38:27,970 --> 04:38:29,830
I'm switching over to nano communication.

6778
04:38:30,290 --> 04:38:30,710
Okay.

6779
04:38:35,090 --> 04:38:36,050
Mr. X?

6780
04:38:36,530 --> 04:38:37,010
Ninja?

6781
04:38:37,050 --> 04:38:37,190
Ninja?

6782
04:38:37,250 --> 04:38:37,730
Correct.

6783
04:38:38,210 --> 04:38:38,850
It's me.

6784
04:38:39,030 --> 04:38:39,230
What?

6785
04:38:39,310 --> 04:38:39,590
That's supposed to be me.

6786
04:38:39,590 --> 04:38:41,270
I thought you were the leader of the Russian troops.

6787
04:38:41,730 --> 04:38:42,170
No.

6788
04:38:42,390 --> 04:38:44,070
That was just a smokescreen.

6789
04:38:44,210 --> 04:38:45,690
You said that about Olga, too?

6790
04:38:45,770 --> 04:38:46,810
This guy just...

6791
04:38:46,810 --> 04:38:47,850
I was sent to provide you support.

6792
04:38:48,070 --> 04:38:48,550
Support.

6793
04:38:48,550 --> 04:38:49,730
This guy says that about any lady.

6794
04:38:49,870 --> 04:38:50,170
Who sent you?

6795
04:38:50,330 --> 04:38:51,030
The colonel?

6796
04:38:51,170 --> 04:38:51,650
No.

6797
04:38:51,930 --> 04:38:53,070
The Patriots.

6798
04:38:53,290 --> 04:38:53,730
What?

6799
04:38:54,170 --> 04:38:54,650
I...

6800
04:38:54,650 --> 04:38:56,230
I deceived my troops.

6801
04:38:56,690 --> 04:38:57,370
Betrayed them.

6802
04:38:57,490 --> 04:38:57,970
Oh, my God.

6803
04:38:58,070 --> 04:38:58,430
But why?

6804
04:38:58,950 --> 04:39:02,870
My child is being held hostage by the Patriots.

6805
04:39:02,930 --> 04:39:03,410
Child.

6806
04:39:03,410 --> 04:39:07,190
It all started two years ago when I lost my father during the tank.

6807
04:39:07,190 --> 04:39:07,510
A tanker incident.

6808
04:39:07,990 --> 04:39:13,910
My men and I had nowhere to go, so we joined forces with an illegal Russian organization.

6809
04:39:14,490 --> 04:39:15,710
The Russian mafia?

6810
04:39:16,090 --> 04:39:17,330
Something like that.

6811
04:39:17,490 --> 04:39:23,470
Actually, I learned much later that it was a subordinate organization of the Patriots.

6812
04:39:23,550 --> 04:39:25,650
I was expecting at the time.

6813
04:39:25,730 --> 04:39:31,910
When I gave birth to my child, it turned out I was in a hospital run by the Patriots.

6814
04:39:31,970 --> 04:39:32,470
No.

6815
04:39:32,570 --> 04:39:34,870
In the morning, my child was gone.

6816
04:39:35,010 --> 04:39:35,610
Oh, my God.

6817
04:39:35,610 --> 04:39:37,110
My baby is being kept somewhere.

6818
04:39:37,190 --> 04:39:38,070
Somewhere in this country.

6819
04:39:38,310 --> 04:39:39,890
Have you ever met your child?

6820
04:39:40,110 --> 04:39:41,010
That's not fair.

6821
04:39:41,150 --> 04:39:41,550
That's not fair.

6822
04:39:41,550 --> 04:39:44,570
Once a month, they send me a photo of my child via network.

6823
04:39:44,710 --> 04:39:45,190
That's not fair.

6824
04:39:45,190 --> 04:39:47,390
I've never even held the child in my own arms.

6825
04:39:47,390 --> 04:39:48,530
Oh, girl.

6826
04:39:48,990 --> 04:39:49,270
I see.

6827
04:39:49,270 --> 04:39:52,250
Given your situation, nobody can blame you for what you did.

6828
04:39:52,550 --> 04:39:53,630
That's your opinion.

6829
04:39:53,630 --> 04:39:54,250
Everyone's just trauma.

6830
04:39:54,270 --> 04:39:54,870
Don't pick on her.

6831
04:39:55,150 --> 04:39:55,330
What about Snake?

6832
04:39:55,330 --> 04:39:56,570
I thought you were enemies.

6833
04:39:56,970 --> 04:39:59,550
He wasn't responsible for my father's death.

6834
04:39:59,690 --> 04:39:59,870
Oh.

6835
04:40:00,070 --> 04:40:02,190
Actually, we owe him our lives.

6836
04:40:03,430 --> 04:40:03,910
Oh.

6837
04:40:05,970 --> 04:40:07,170
Two years ago, my father died.

6838
04:40:07,170 --> 04:40:09,950
So, they were responsible for getting us out of the sinking tanker alive.

6839
04:40:10,030 --> 04:40:10,330
That's me.

6840
04:40:10,330 --> 04:40:10,450
That's me.

6841
04:40:11,370 --> 04:40:12,810
Oh, that did not happen.

6842
04:40:13,250 --> 04:40:14,270
That's from the trailer.

6843
04:40:14,510 --> 04:40:16,430
So, you were partners since the incident?

6844
04:40:16,750 --> 04:40:17,130
No.

6845
04:40:17,210 --> 04:40:19,350
I only found out the truth shortly before this.

6846
04:40:19,530 --> 04:40:19,890
Huh?

6847
04:40:20,230 --> 04:40:21,770
When I confronted him here.

6848
04:40:22,550 --> 04:40:23,070
She's dead.

6849
04:40:23,070 --> 04:40:23,590
You fought with Snake?

6850
04:40:23,730 --> 04:40:24,130
When?

6851
04:40:24,750 --> 04:40:25,550
Two years ago.

6852
04:40:25,610 --> 04:40:28,310
Well, it was around the time you were holding hands with that girl.

6853
04:40:28,650 --> 04:40:29,090
Oh.

6854
04:40:29,190 --> 04:40:29,630
Snake.

6855
04:40:32,310 --> 04:40:32,750
Oh.

6856
04:40:33,970 --> 04:40:35,610
Holding hands with that girl.

6857
04:40:36,390 --> 04:40:36,830
Oh.

6858
04:40:36,830 --> 04:40:37,150
Oh.

6859
04:40:38,250 --> 04:40:42,750
So, you joined hands with him to pay back a debt.

6860
04:40:43,010 --> 04:40:43,450
No.

6861
04:40:43,790 --> 04:40:44,630
Mutual gain.

6862
04:40:44,990 --> 04:40:45,870
Mutual gain.

6863
04:40:46,190 --> 04:40:46,290
Hmm.

6864
04:40:46,290 --> 04:40:47,950
My job was to assist you.

6865
04:40:48,070 --> 04:40:51,230
If Solidus gets away with Arsenal, your mission is a failure.

6866
04:40:51,430 --> 04:40:51,670
True.

6867
04:40:51,810 --> 04:40:54,550
The Patriots would judge that as failure on my part.

6868
04:40:54,670 --> 04:40:55,010
Oh.

6869
04:40:55,010 --> 04:40:56,390
And terminate my child.

6870
04:40:56,630 --> 04:41:00,670
Putting it simply, my child's life depends on your success.

6871
04:41:00,890 --> 04:41:01,030
Maybe.

6872
04:41:01,210 --> 04:41:02,950
So, you did it all for your child.

6873
04:41:03,170 --> 04:41:05,310
But why would the Patriots want to help me?

6874
04:41:05,490 --> 04:41:05,870
Maybe.

6875
04:41:05,870 --> 04:41:07,150
Are they hoping I'll take Solidus?

6876
04:41:07,790 --> 04:41:08,190
No.

6877
04:41:08,530 --> 04:41:09,670
You're just like me.

6878
04:41:09,930 --> 04:41:11,170
We're just pawns.

6879
04:41:11,170 --> 04:41:11,330
No.

6880
04:41:11,330 --> 04:41:12,090
We're not pawns.

6881
04:41:12,090 --> 04:41:12,830
Pawns for what purpose?

6882
04:41:13,090 --> 04:41:14,110
We're not pawns in the government.

6883
04:41:15,150 --> 04:41:15,550
Huh?

6884
04:41:16,130 --> 04:41:17,850
You'll figure it out sooner or later.

6885
04:41:18,090 --> 04:41:19,830
But I wonder if you'll handle it true.

6886
04:41:19,970 --> 04:41:21,450
Listen when someone's talking to you.

6887
04:41:21,590 --> 04:41:22,130
What do you mean?

6888
04:41:22,150 --> 04:41:22,170
Listen.

6889
04:41:22,170 --> 04:41:23,590
We haven't got time for this.

6890
04:41:23,990 --> 04:41:25,370
Solidus will commence his attack any minute.

6891
04:41:25,370 --> 04:41:26,330
I don't know if I've ever heard that one before.

6892
04:41:26,510 --> 04:41:27,510
He's got to be stopped.

6893
04:41:27,950 --> 04:41:28,830
What about the virus?

6894
04:41:29,150 --> 04:41:30,310
No results so far.

6895
04:41:30,510 --> 04:41:31,590
Make sure Olga doesn't see the picture they took.

6896
04:41:31,590 --> 04:41:31,610
Could change this.

6897
04:41:31,610 --> 04:41:32,970
I think the Patriots have tampered with the program.

6898
04:41:33,290 --> 04:41:34,130
Will it work?

6899
04:41:34,350 --> 04:41:35,210
I don't know.

6900
04:41:35,590 --> 04:41:36,850
Get me out of this thing.

6901
04:41:36,850 --> 04:41:37,670
Not yet.

6902
04:41:38,050 --> 04:41:38,450
That's not fair.

6903
04:41:38,450 --> 04:41:40,810
I'll release your restraints after I leave this room.

6904
04:41:40,990 --> 04:41:41,190
Hey!

6905
04:41:41,350 --> 04:41:41,470
Oh, okay.

6906
04:41:41,470 --> 04:41:42,130
Where's my gear?

6907
04:41:42,810 --> 04:41:43,730
Snake's got everything.

6908
04:41:44,050 --> 04:41:45,150
I couldn't bring it here.

6909
04:41:45,190 --> 04:41:45,670
Oh, my God.

6910
04:41:45,730 --> 04:41:46,830
And where do I find Snake?

6911
04:41:46,830 --> 04:41:47,310
It's chilly.

6912
04:41:47,970 --> 04:41:49,070
It's too cold.

6913
04:41:49,130 --> 04:41:49,510
Olga!

6914
04:41:51,430 --> 04:41:52,510
I've never heard that.

6915
04:41:52,570 --> 04:41:53,590
I don't think I have either.

6916
04:41:54,230 --> 04:41:55,010
I don't have a...

6917
04:41:55,010 --> 04:41:56,630
The passageway ahead leads to a hangar.

6918
04:41:56,750 --> 04:41:57,910
He'll be waiting there.

6919
04:41:57,990 --> 04:42:00,470
I still haven't gotten my favorite rose one, though.

6920
04:42:01,230 --> 04:42:01,710
I gave him a card key for the hangar.

6921
04:42:01,710 --> 04:42:02,350
It's the egotistical woman one.

6922
04:42:02,350 --> 04:42:04,070
Does Snake's plans destroy Arsenal gear?

6923
04:42:04,550 --> 04:42:04,950
No.

6924
04:42:04,950 --> 04:42:04,970
Even for Snake, it's impossible.

6925
04:42:04,970 --> 04:42:05,270
Oh, my God.

6926
04:42:05,270 --> 04:42:05,710
Here it comes.

6927
04:42:05,930 --> 04:42:06,830
Oh, my God.

6928
04:42:08,850 --> 04:42:09,810
Please, guys.

6929
04:42:10,050 --> 04:42:15,030
If there are people here who have never seen Metal Gear Solid 2 before, please, no spoil.

6930
04:42:15,450 --> 04:42:17,370
I still can't afford to be discovered.

6931
04:42:18,410 --> 04:42:19,330
Please, no spoil.

6932
04:42:22,250 --> 04:42:24,370
The line is, you're a real egotistical woman.

6933
04:42:24,430 --> 04:42:25,310
Yeah, I love that one.

6934
04:42:27,150 --> 04:42:29,030
Olga, you can't keep this up.

6935
04:42:29,150 --> 04:42:30,350
They're bound to find you.

6936
04:42:30,610 --> 04:42:31,090
Listen.

6937
04:42:31,250 --> 04:42:32,790
I'll free you in a little while.

6938
04:42:33,310 --> 04:42:34,050
Brace yourself.

6939
04:42:34,770 --> 04:42:35,790
Oh, my God.

6940
04:42:36,330 --> 04:42:36,810
Oh, my God.

6941
04:42:38,410 --> 04:42:40,390
I can't even move my head anymore.

6942
04:42:40,690 --> 04:42:41,510
She hit me.

6943
04:42:41,730 --> 04:42:42,890
Where'd she hit me at?

6944
04:42:46,170 --> 04:42:46,750
Hello?

6945
04:42:48,630 --> 04:42:49,210
Hello?

6946
04:42:52,250 --> 04:42:52,830
Hello?

6947
04:42:56,310 --> 04:42:56,950
Hello?

6948
04:42:58,710 --> 04:42:59,350
Hello?

6949
04:42:59,730 --> 04:43:00,070
Ah!

6950
04:43:01,450 --> 04:43:02,490
The stomach.

6951
04:43:04,530 --> 04:43:07,070
You can't change the camera view yet, I don't believe it.

6952
04:43:07,570 --> 04:43:10,770
You have to wait until after your first release.

6953
04:43:11,570 --> 04:43:12,210
I know.

6954
04:43:27,950 --> 04:43:28,950
No.

6955
04:43:32,150 --> 04:43:33,150
No.

6956
04:43:35,510 --> 04:43:36,510
No.

6957
04:43:36,950 --> 04:43:39,390
Oh my god.

6958
04:43:40,670 --> 04:43:42,510
You're really selfish, you know.

6959
04:43:42,710 --> 04:43:43,710
No.

6960
04:44:05,710 --> 04:44:06,550
Gun powder!

6961
04:44:07,230 --> 04:44:07,550
Yippee!

6962
04:44:08,730 --> 04:44:09,410
AK.

6963
04:44:12,110 --> 04:44:12,790
Jack.

6964
04:44:18,130 --> 04:44:20,510
You were like... you were like ten years old!

6965
04:44:22,830 --> 04:44:23,590
You didn't ask how many to kill.

6966
04:44:23,790 --> 04:44:26,430
If you didn't, you were the one they shot instead.

6967
04:44:27,150 --> 04:44:27,870
It's okay.

6968
04:44:28,150 --> 04:44:29,630
No one is blaming you.

6969
04:44:29,750 --> 04:44:30,590
I'm blaming you.

6970
04:44:30,810 --> 04:44:32,710
We were shown Hollywood action films every day.

6971
04:44:32,910 --> 04:44:35,170
The kind with macho guys and big guns.

6972
04:44:35,390 --> 04:44:37,030
They call it image training.

6973
04:44:37,050 --> 04:44:37,550
That's crazy.

6974
04:44:38,550 --> 04:44:40,010
He had to watch movies.

6975
04:44:40,210 --> 04:44:42,490
They built us from the ground up into killing machines.

6976
04:44:43,790 --> 04:44:45,470
We were fed once a day.

6977
04:44:45,690 --> 04:44:48,630
I can still taste the gun powder they mixed into the food.

6978
04:44:48,950 --> 04:44:49,830
Gun powder?

6979
04:44:50,070 --> 04:44:51,050
In the food?

6980
04:44:51,330 --> 04:44:51,810
Yeah!

6981
04:44:51,810 --> 04:44:52,390
Gun powder!

6982
04:44:52,430 --> 04:44:55,310
Our mother had to Halloween it, giving it hallucinogenic properties.

6983
04:44:55,650 --> 04:44:56,110
Woo!

6984
04:44:56,110 --> 04:44:57,350
It kept us drugged.

6985
04:44:57,850 --> 04:44:58,350
Controllable.

6986
04:44:58,610 --> 04:44:59,710
Oh my god.

6987
04:45:00,050 --> 04:45:00,710
Oh my god.

6988
04:45:00,710 --> 04:45:02,350
That is so awful.

6989
04:45:04,050 --> 04:45:06,710
Rose's reaction there is like the most believable thing.

6990
04:45:06,910 --> 04:45:09,150
When the Civil War ended, those of us who survived were taken in by NGOs.

6991
04:45:09,290 --> 04:45:10,250
His cheeks are the bomb.

6992
04:45:10,290 --> 04:45:11,610
That gave me a new life in the States.

6993
04:45:11,810 --> 04:45:12,850
I can't complain.

6994
04:45:14,630 --> 04:45:15,990
But nothing's changed.

6995
04:45:16,270 --> 04:45:21,110
The only people who have no problem with my past have secrets and agendas of their own.

6996
04:45:22,390 --> 04:45:23,250
Terrible nightmares.

6997
04:45:23,770 --> 04:45:24,650
Every night.

6998
04:45:24,890 --> 04:45:26,150
I can never forget.

6999
04:45:27,870 --> 04:45:28,390
Jack.

7000
04:45:28,390 --> 04:45:28,910
Jack.

7001
04:45:29,230 --> 04:45:30,630
I'm afraid of the night.

7002
04:45:30,910 --> 04:45:32,810
That's why I don't sleep next to you.

7003
04:45:32,970 --> 04:45:34,730
You should have told me.

7004
04:45:36,010 --> 04:45:36,990
Told you what?

7005
04:45:37,390 --> 04:45:38,490
That I'm a killer?

7006
04:45:38,690 --> 04:45:40,030
And always have been?

7007
04:45:40,290 --> 04:45:40,750
No.

7008
04:45:41,190 --> 04:45:41,710
No.

7009
04:45:41,850 --> 04:45:45,810
What I hate more than anything else in the world is my own past.

7010
04:45:46,350 --> 04:45:49,890
I didn't want you or anyone to know about it.

7011
04:45:49,890 --> 04:45:50,570
Oh, God.

7012
04:45:54,230 --> 04:45:56,950
Now I know why I was chosen for this mission.

7013
04:45:57,270 --> 04:46:03,450
No one can take him on, take him down, except me.

7014
04:46:04,570 --> 04:46:07,430
I've been kept alive this long for this.

7015
04:46:07,590 --> 04:46:11,050
I knew as soon as I saw Solidus.

7016
04:46:11,990 --> 04:46:15,010
Jack, I love you the way you are now.

7017
04:46:15,150 --> 04:46:16,970
You have to believe me.

7018
04:46:19,890 --> 04:46:22,190
I didn't know anything about you, I admit that.

7019
04:46:22,230 --> 04:46:22,770
So dramatic.

7020
04:46:23,110 --> 04:46:25,210
Where you were born, how you grew up.

7021
04:46:25,330 --> 04:46:26,230
Pass the popcorn, please.

7022
04:46:26,250 --> 04:46:26,970
But I know that now.

7023
04:46:27,330 --> 04:46:30,750
And I know that what I feel for you can only get better.

7024
04:46:31,010 --> 04:46:33,930
And I'll share in your past if that's the price.

7025
04:46:35,870 --> 04:46:37,350
It doesn't work that way.

7026
04:46:37,710 --> 04:46:40,030
No one can share the burden of what I've done.

7027
04:46:40,690 --> 04:46:43,810
It's not one of those warm and fuzzy things couples share.

7028
04:46:44,190 --> 04:46:44,390
No.

7029
04:46:44,710 --> 04:46:47,510
I accept the good and the bad, Jack.

7030
04:46:48,390 --> 04:46:49,870
That's what you do for someone.

7031
04:46:49,870 --> 04:46:50,750
Someone you love.

7032
04:46:51,490 --> 04:46:53,830
I don't want to share my past with anyone.

7033
04:46:54,130 --> 04:46:55,910
I just want to forget about it.

7034
04:46:57,550 --> 04:47:01,770
Jack, I haven't told you, you know, about what I've done.

7035
04:47:01,970 --> 04:47:04,110
Uh oh, she got secrets.

7036
04:47:04,670 --> 04:47:09,530
The last two years with you, it's been more than I've ever hoped for.

7037
04:47:10,770 --> 04:47:12,610
Jack, Jack, oh Jack.

7038
04:47:12,670 --> 04:47:13,870
But I can't go any farther.

7039
04:47:15,050 --> 04:47:16,250
I'm breaking up with you.

7040
04:47:16,250 --> 04:47:17,230
I know you want to get married.

7041
04:47:17,510 --> 04:47:18,470
Oh, I...

7042
04:47:18,470 --> 04:47:20,450
But I can't.

7043
04:47:20,450 --> 04:47:21,910
Imagine getting broken up over Kodak.

7044
04:47:21,910 --> 04:47:22,530
I can't risk starting a family.

7045
04:47:23,750 --> 04:47:25,910
There's no way to erase my childhood.

7046
04:47:28,990 --> 04:47:30,170
It's all right, Jack.

7047
04:47:30,610 --> 04:47:33,170
Please, don't say any more.

7048
04:47:36,350 --> 04:47:37,130
We're free.

7049
04:47:38,570 --> 04:47:40,030
Took her long enough.

7050
04:47:40,290 --> 04:47:41,850
Gosh, oh my god.

7051
04:47:43,730 --> 04:47:44,990
Get back in.

7052
04:47:45,150 --> 04:47:45,710
Oh.

7053
04:47:52,200 --> 04:47:53,320
Thank you, thank you.

7054
04:47:53,600 --> 04:47:53,900
Bye.

7055
04:47:55,760 --> 04:47:58,040
So this is the cosplayer you saw at MGS con.

7056
04:47:58,140 --> 04:47:58,820
Minus the towel.

7057
04:47:59,100 --> 04:47:59,960
Yeah, exactly.

7058
04:48:01,760 --> 04:48:02,280
Light.

7059
04:48:05,760 --> 04:48:06,280
Wow.

7060
04:48:07,340 --> 04:48:08,300
Oh my.

7061
04:48:10,180 --> 04:48:11,220
Oh god.

7062
04:48:11,360 --> 04:48:12,200
Oh my god.

7063
04:48:12,300 --> 04:48:13,060
Oh my god.

7064
04:48:13,100 --> 04:48:13,500
Oh my god.

7065
04:48:13,620 --> 04:48:15,640
I really swear you could see it.

7066
04:48:16,320 --> 04:48:18,440
I really swear you could see it.

7067
04:48:22,000 --> 04:48:25,480
I swear you could see something when he lays down.

7068
04:48:25,980 --> 04:48:26,760
Oh my god.

7069
04:48:27,080 --> 04:48:27,980
Thank goodness.

7070
04:48:28,180 --> 04:48:29,660
We don't want to catch a cold now.

7071
04:48:31,460 --> 04:48:32,920
We don't want to catch a cold now.

7072
04:48:36,060 --> 04:48:36,580
Beep, beep.

7073
04:48:38,240 --> 04:48:39,780
Which way does this go anyway?

7074
04:48:40,080 --> 04:48:41,340
It doesn't even have a number.

7075
04:48:43,140 --> 04:48:45,520
Double-cheeked on a Sunday afternoon.

7076
04:48:45,820 --> 04:48:46,280
Hallelujah.

7077
04:48:47,820 --> 04:48:48,300
Oh.

7078
04:48:48,300 --> 04:48:48,420
Oh.

7079
04:48:48,420 --> 04:48:48,720
Oh my god.

7080
04:48:48,720 --> 04:48:48,940
A little...

7081
04:48:57,900 --> 04:48:58,940
Pause midflip.

7082
04:48:59,520 --> 04:49:00,040
Oh.

7083
04:49:00,160 --> 04:49:01,980
That was actually...

7084
04:49:02,720 --> 04:49:04,860
That was actually pretty good.

7085
04:49:05,180 --> 04:49:07,220
I remember this scene like it was yesterday.

7086
04:49:07,420 --> 04:49:08,300
Truly touching.

7087
04:49:12,740 --> 04:49:13,860
He's a Ken doll.

7088
04:49:18,520 --> 04:49:19,940
He's just a Ken doll.

7089
04:49:19,960 --> 04:49:20,620
There's nothing there.

7090
04:49:25,060 --> 04:49:25,800
Oh, god.

7091
04:49:25,840 --> 04:49:26,320
Here we go.

7092
04:49:26,620 --> 04:49:27,140
Colonel.

7093
04:49:27,240 --> 04:49:27,660
I'm naked.

7094
04:49:27,680 --> 04:49:29,900
I'm naked and cold and the clap of my glutes is alerting the guards!

7095
04:49:32,240 --> 04:49:34,580
I'm gonna need to get food soonish.

7096
04:49:34,780 --> 04:49:36,000
I'm starting to get hungry.

7097
04:49:40,280 --> 04:49:41,120
I'm naked.

7098
04:49:41,680 --> 04:49:42,260
I'm naked.

7099
04:49:42,680 --> 04:49:43,380
I'm naked!

7100
04:49:44,200 --> 04:49:45,200
Rendezvous with that man.

7101
04:49:45,700 --> 04:49:49,500
Not while I'm naked, please!

7102
04:49:51,520 --> 04:49:52,740
Not while I'm naked!

7103
04:49:52,740 --> 04:49:52,840
Not while I'm naked!

7104
04:49:55,900 --> 04:49:57,300
Don't say it like that!

7105
04:49:59,480 --> 04:50:01,300
Jack, I guess you need to save.

7106
04:50:01,540 --> 04:50:02,660
I guess so.

7107
04:50:04,300 --> 04:50:06,120
Try getting an alert and going back?

7108
04:50:06,920 --> 04:50:08,260
I'm pretty sure I have.

7109
04:50:08,460 --> 04:50:12,900
Why is my clock keep changing between 2099 and 2000?

7110
04:50:16,440 --> 04:50:17,360
Hang in there.

7111
04:50:18,420 --> 04:50:18,940
Thanks!

7112
04:50:20,280 --> 04:50:22,200
Time to rendezvous with that man!

7113
04:50:22,740 --> 04:50:25,200
Oh gosh, this part you actually have to be sneaky.

7114
04:50:25,940 --> 04:50:27,380
What was the best way to go?

7115
04:50:27,580 --> 04:50:28,380
I think I remember.

7116
04:50:30,060 --> 04:50:30,580
Okay.

7117
04:50:31,460 --> 04:50:32,360
It's time.

7118
04:50:34,220 --> 04:50:35,260
It's time.

7119
04:50:35,300 --> 04:50:36,020
It's time.

7120
04:50:40,940 --> 04:50:42,380
Raiden, do you copy?

7121
04:50:42,640 --> 04:50:44,460
You must continue your mission.

7122
04:50:45,020 --> 04:50:46,320
I've lost all my gear.

7123
04:50:46,520 --> 04:50:47,960
I need to locate Snake.

7124
04:50:48,360 --> 04:50:50,540
He was never factored into the simulation.

7125
04:50:50,880 --> 04:50:52,040
Leave him out of this.

7126
04:50:52,300 --> 04:50:53,600
I can't do much naked.

7127
04:50:53,840 --> 04:50:55,060
Especially in this temperature.

7128
04:50:55,060 --> 04:50:55,860
That's cold!

7129
04:50:55,940 --> 04:50:56,240
That's true.

7130
04:50:56,640 --> 04:50:59,520
You won't be able to attack or enter the hanging mode either.

7131
04:50:59,720 --> 04:51:01,280
I think Snake has my gear.

7132
04:51:01,960 --> 04:51:04,300
Raiden, take out Solidus and his men.

7133
04:51:04,500 --> 04:51:06,380
You must recover Arsenal intact.

7134
04:51:07,620 --> 04:51:10,140
Colonel, are you under orders from the Patriots?

7135
04:51:10,180 --> 04:51:16,360
Your role, that is mission, is to infiltrate the structure and disarm the terrorists.

7136
04:51:16,360 --> 04:51:17,220
My role?

7137
04:51:17,480 --> 04:51:19,100
Why do you keep saying that?

7138
04:51:19,300 --> 04:51:20,120
Why not?

7139
04:51:20,200 --> 04:51:22,280
This is a type of role-playing game.

7140
04:51:22,440 --> 04:51:24,820
The point is that you play out your part.

7141
04:51:25,060 --> 04:51:27,520
And I expect you to turn in a perfect performance.

7142
04:51:27,900 --> 04:51:30,320
Colonel, I just remembered something.

7143
04:51:30,600 --> 04:51:31,020
What?

7144
04:51:31,460 --> 04:51:33,300
That I've never met you in person.

7145
04:51:33,440 --> 04:51:34,720
Not once.

7146
04:51:36,300 --> 04:51:39,140
Complete your mission according to the simulation.

7147
04:51:39,620 --> 04:51:40,820
Colonel, who are you?

7148
04:51:40,940 --> 04:51:41,240
What's a simulation?

7149
04:51:41,240 --> 04:51:42,300
No more questions.

7150
04:51:42,420 --> 04:51:43,760
We have Rosemary.

7151
04:51:44,100 --> 04:51:44,260
What?

7152
04:51:44,460 --> 04:51:45,080
What do you mean by that?

7153
04:51:45,340 --> 04:51:46,400
Over and out.

7154
04:51:46,740 --> 04:51:47,620
Raiden, out.

7155
04:51:53,760 --> 04:51:55,820
I like this area because...

7156
04:51:55,820 --> 04:51:57,720
All the little rays.

7157
04:51:58,440 --> 04:51:59,520
You can see them here.

7158
04:52:01,660 --> 04:52:03,260
The music here is so crazy.

7159
04:52:05,760 --> 04:52:07,560
Oh my gosh, you can see my breath.

7160
04:52:17,000 --> 04:52:18,780
The floor is so cool too.

7161
04:52:18,900 --> 04:52:20,920
Everything about this part is so cool.

7162
04:52:25,340 --> 04:52:28,580
Raiden, turn the game console off right now.

7163
04:52:28,580 --> 04:52:29,540
What did you say?

7164
04:52:29,820 --> 04:52:31,120
The mission is a failure.

7165
04:52:31,320 --> 04:52:32,940
Cut the power right now.

7166
04:52:33,140 --> 04:52:34,220
What's wrong with you?

7167
04:52:34,500 --> 04:52:35,280
Don't worry.

7168
04:52:35,500 --> 04:52:36,200
It's a game.

7169
04:52:36,380 --> 04:52:38,080
It's a game just like usual.

7170
04:52:38,280 --> 04:52:38,940
Great timing.

7171
04:52:39,160 --> 04:52:40,900
You'll ruin your eyes playing so close to the TV.

7172
04:52:41,180 --> 04:52:41,460
What?

7173
04:52:41,460 --> 04:52:42,380
What are you talking about?

7174
04:52:43,200 --> 04:52:46,680
Raiden, something happened to me last Thursday when I was driving home.

7175
04:52:46,900 --> 04:52:47,180
You make no sense.

7176
04:52:47,180 --> 04:52:47,360
I love this.

7177
04:52:47,360 --> 04:52:48,600
I had a couple of miles to go.

7178
04:52:48,820 --> 04:52:52,920
I looked up and saw a glowing orange object in the sky to the east.

7179
04:52:53,120 --> 04:52:55,340
It was moving very irregularly.

7180
04:52:55,520 --> 04:52:58,560
Suddenly, there was intense light all around me.

7181
04:52:58,560 --> 04:53:01,020
And when I came to, I was home.

7182
04:53:01,260 --> 04:53:02,920
What do you think happened to me?

7183
04:53:03,080 --> 04:53:03,700
Aliens.

7184
04:53:04,260 --> 04:53:04,900
Fine.

7185
04:53:05,220 --> 04:53:06,120
Forget it.

7186
04:53:06,600 --> 04:53:08,220
Oh, my God.

7187
04:53:11,300 --> 04:53:13,340
I love this so much.

7188
04:53:13,740 --> 04:53:18,360
Oh, my God.

7189
04:53:18,400 --> 04:53:18,560
Boo.

7190
04:53:18,720 --> 04:53:20,940
Destroy the final weapon.

7191
04:53:21,260 --> 04:53:22,380
Metal Gear.

7192
04:53:22,700 --> 04:53:23,100
Coachella.

7193
04:53:23,180 --> 04:53:24,000
Big Bus.

7194
04:53:24,640 --> 04:53:25,280
No.

7195
04:53:25,400 --> 04:53:26,040
No.

7196
04:53:26,040 --> 04:53:26,160
No.

7197
04:53:27,840 --> 04:53:28,480
No.

7198
04:53:28,560 --> 04:53:29,540
Oh, my God.

7199
04:53:37,410 --> 04:53:37,770
Wait.

7200
04:53:37,830 --> 04:53:38,110
I can't...

7201
04:53:38,110 --> 04:53:38,330
Yeah.

7202
04:53:38,410 --> 04:53:38,990
He's right there.

7203
04:53:40,490 --> 04:53:41,010
Oh, gosh.

7204
04:53:52,660 --> 04:53:54,080
How do I get past this guy?

7205
04:53:57,760 --> 04:53:58,280
Hold on.

7206
04:53:58,380 --> 04:53:59,480
I'm waiting for him to leave.

7207
04:53:59,880 --> 04:54:00,880
I think they're my...

7208
04:54:01,780 --> 04:54:02,420
Oh, my God.

7209
04:54:02,420 --> 04:54:02,660
Sorry.

7210
04:54:02,740 --> 04:54:03,180
I took too long.

7211
04:54:05,320 --> 04:54:08,640
Honestly, though, you have played the game for a long time.

7212
04:54:08,820 --> 04:54:09,120
I have.

7213
04:54:09,200 --> 04:54:11,240
Don't you have anything else to do with your time out?

7214
04:54:12,840 --> 04:54:13,200
Rude.

7215
04:54:13,320 --> 04:54:13,680
Oh, my God.

7216
04:54:18,440 --> 04:54:19,020
Oh, yeah.

7217
04:54:19,080 --> 04:54:20,360
There's a box over here, actually, though.

7218
04:54:20,400 --> 04:54:20,680
Isn't there?

7219
04:54:23,300 --> 04:54:23,660
Yeah.

7220
04:54:24,260 --> 04:54:24,620
Nice.

7221
04:54:24,760 --> 04:54:24,960
Okay.

7222
04:54:25,060 --> 04:54:25,520
I remembered.

7223
04:54:26,500 --> 04:54:26,860
Yeah.

7224
04:54:26,900 --> 04:54:28,620
We finally got our zone in the Ender Box.

7225
04:54:29,120 --> 04:54:29,420
Hooray.

7226
04:54:37,160 --> 04:54:37,520
Okay.

7227
04:54:37,880 --> 04:54:39,500
We just wait for this guy to go past.

7228
04:54:41,220 --> 04:54:41,580
Oh.

7229
04:54:42,520 --> 04:54:42,880
Ah.

7230
04:54:44,280 --> 04:54:44,640
Oh.

7231
04:54:49,390 --> 04:54:50,110
Can I...

7232
04:54:50,850 --> 04:54:51,510
Not right now.

7233
04:54:51,610 --> 04:54:52,170
Oh, my gosh.

7234
04:54:52,190 --> 04:54:52,390
I can't.

7235
04:54:52,410 --> 04:54:52,630
I can't hang.

7236
04:54:52,810 --> 04:54:53,030
Oh.

7237
04:54:53,250 --> 04:54:53,690
Shoot.

7238
04:54:53,870 --> 04:54:54,290
What's that?

7239
04:54:54,530 --> 04:54:54,850
Nothing.

7240
04:55:01,000 --> 04:55:05,120
Actually, there is something I have been meaning to tell you, but I just couldn't.

7241
04:55:05,120 --> 04:55:05,680
What's that supposed to mean?

7242
04:55:05,680 --> 04:55:06,520
I think you should know, though.

7243
04:55:06,520 --> 04:55:06,900
What's that?

7244
04:55:07,000 --> 04:55:11,540
On Saturday morning last week, I saw a guy leaving Rosemary's room.

7245
04:55:11,800 --> 04:55:13,180
How should I put it?

7246
04:55:13,300 --> 04:55:15,540
It was like they were intimate.

7247
04:55:16,160 --> 04:55:16,780
I'm sorry.

7248
04:55:16,900 --> 04:55:17,440
What's that supposed to mean?

7249
04:55:17,440 --> 04:55:19,200
Sorry to bring this up during the mission, but...

7250
04:55:20,040 --> 04:55:20,480
Yeah.

7251
04:55:21,240 --> 04:55:21,680
Yeah.

7252
04:55:21,880 --> 04:55:22,020
Hmm.

7253
04:55:23,280 --> 04:55:23,720
Yeah.

7254
04:55:23,900 --> 04:55:24,320
Just...

7255
04:55:24,320 --> 04:55:24,460
Hmm.

7256
04:55:26,180 --> 04:55:26,440
Exactly.

7257
04:55:30,430 --> 04:55:31,310
I can't...

7258
04:55:31,310 --> 04:55:31,910
Oh, wait.

7259
04:55:31,990 --> 04:55:32,830
I think I can go right here.

7260
04:55:35,070 --> 04:55:35,950
Oh, no!

7261
04:55:37,070 --> 04:55:37,790
Just a box.

7262
04:55:40,710 --> 04:55:41,370
Oh, shit.

7263
04:55:43,530 --> 04:55:43,970
Um...

7264
04:55:45,470 --> 04:55:46,550
Just a box.

7265
04:55:47,030 --> 04:55:49,070
I thought I was close enough to the edge.

7266
04:55:52,130 --> 04:55:52,570
Hmm.

7267
04:55:52,790 --> 04:55:52,950
Hmm.

7268
04:55:54,350 --> 04:55:54,790
Hmm.

7269
04:55:55,230 --> 04:55:55,350
Hmm.

7270
04:55:55,350 --> 04:55:55,490
Hmm.

7271
04:55:55,870 --> 04:55:56,090
Hmm.

7272
04:55:56,350 --> 04:55:56,450
Hmm.

7273
04:56:00,250 --> 04:56:01,210
No doubt.

7274
04:56:07,180 --> 04:56:07,900
Oh, shit.

7275
04:56:08,440 --> 04:56:08,920
Uh...

7276
04:56:08,920 --> 04:56:09,760
I lost my box.

7277
04:56:10,180 --> 04:56:11,180
And, um...

7278
04:56:11,180 --> 04:56:12,320
I lost everything.

7279
04:56:12,700 --> 04:56:13,180
Everybody?

7280
04:56:13,520 --> 04:56:14,500
I lost it.

7281
04:56:14,660 --> 04:56:15,500
This is it.

7282
04:56:15,520 --> 04:56:16,060
This is over.

7283
04:56:16,080 --> 04:56:16,840
It's over for me.

7284
04:56:18,060 --> 04:56:20,960
I don't remember how to get to the stairs now.

7285
04:56:22,840 --> 04:56:23,980
There's even cameras.

7286
04:56:24,540 --> 04:56:25,500
It's so over.

7287
04:56:25,660 --> 04:56:26,820
Can I go underneath here?

7288
04:56:27,260 --> 04:56:27,300
Hmm?

7289
04:56:28,580 --> 04:56:29,080
Who's there?

7290
04:56:29,540 --> 04:56:30,020
Nobody!

7291
04:56:30,020 --> 04:56:30,260
Nobody!

7292
04:56:35,290 --> 04:56:36,290
Where's the stairs?

7293
04:56:38,850 --> 04:56:41,210
Even my patience has its limits.

7294
04:56:41,430 --> 04:56:44,050
I just can't leave this thing up to you any longer.

7295
04:56:44,230 --> 04:56:45,410
I'll do the fighting.

7296
04:56:45,630 --> 04:56:46,890
You can just go home.

7297
04:56:46,990 --> 04:56:47,230
Okay.

7298
04:56:47,710 --> 04:56:48,270
Okay!

7299
04:56:48,650 --> 04:56:49,890
Sounds good to me, man!

7300
04:56:50,350 --> 04:56:51,250
You go ahead!

7301
04:56:51,890 --> 04:56:53,250
You do the fighting.

7302
04:56:53,650 --> 04:56:54,850
You do the cooking.

7303
04:56:55,110 --> 04:56:55,230
You do

7304
04:57:02,460 --> 04:57:02,800
the...

7305
04:57:02,800 --> 04:57:03,500
Who's there?

7306
04:57:08,450 --> 04:57:09,010
Hmm.

7307
04:57:10,310 --> 04:57:10,870
Exactly.

7308
04:57:11,530 --> 04:57:12,390
No one.

7309
04:57:17,900 --> 04:57:18,740
Oh, shoot.

7310
04:57:19,120 --> 04:57:19,680
Oh, shit.

7311
04:57:19,700 --> 04:57:21,320
Oh, I'm so... This is it.

7312
04:57:21,340 --> 04:57:21,780
This is it.

7313
04:57:21,820 --> 04:57:22,500
It's over for me!

7314
04:57:22,620 --> 04:57:23,440
I don't have a box!

7315
04:57:24,080 --> 04:57:27,580
An anemone or clematis plant's juice can cause a rash.

7316
04:57:27,860 --> 04:57:30,420
When prune them, it's a good idea to wear gloves.

7317
04:57:49,030 --> 04:57:49,810
Oh, shoot!

7318
04:57:51,390 --> 04:57:51,870
Bye!

7319
04:58:10,680 --> 04:58:11,940
Variety level 13.

7320
04:58:12,840 --> 04:58:13,720
The giant!

7321
04:58:13,720 --> 04:58:13,920
The giant!

7322
04:58:15,120 --> 04:58:15,840
Granola!

7323
04:58:16,660 --> 04:58:17,740
G -Ginola!

7324
04:58:21,060 --> 04:58:23,240
The giant genome soldiers.

7325
04:58:23,580 --> 04:58:23,940
Look at them.

7326
04:58:25,020 --> 04:58:26,820
We are missions!

7327
04:58:27,080 --> 04:58:27,800
We are missions!

7328
04:58:27,960 --> 04:58:28,600
We are missions!

7329
04:58:30,720 --> 04:58:31,440
Yeah?

7330
04:58:32,980 --> 04:58:33,700
Granola.

7331
04:58:34,060 --> 04:58:43,640
I hear it's amazing when the famous purple stuffed worm in Flapjaw's space with the tuning fork does a raw blink on Harry Caray Rock.

7332
04:58:43,720 --> 04:58:45,220
I need scissors.

7333
04:58:45,900 --> 04:58:46,340
61.

7334
04:58:46,860 --> 04:58:47,920
I need scissors.

7335
04:58:48,140 --> 04:58:48,580
61.

7336
04:58:48,760 --> 04:58:51,600
When I met Paul Eiding, he wrote that on my...

7337
04:58:52,660 --> 04:58:55,100
He wrote that on my thing without me even asking.

7338
04:58:55,480 --> 04:58:56,360
I was so excited.

7339
04:58:56,440 --> 04:58:58,020
On my poster that I had him sign.

7340
04:58:58,180 --> 04:59:02,460
President Baker should be somewhere to the south of where you blasted through the wall.

7341
04:59:02,780 --> 04:59:04,800
There's some idle Easter eggs with these calls.

7342
04:59:05,300 --> 04:59:06,020
Oh, that's right!

7343
04:59:06,240 --> 04:59:07,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7344
04:59:07,200 --> 04:59:07,760
I do remember.

7345
04:59:08,080 --> 04:59:09,860
I had to run an errand and just got back.

7346
04:59:10,160 --> 04:59:10,940
Oh, there she is!

7347
04:59:12,360 --> 04:59:13,360
I think I missed something.

7348
04:59:14,460 --> 04:59:15,060
Um...

7349
04:59:16,640 --> 04:59:17,940
I need scissors.

7350
04:59:18,180 --> 04:59:18,580
61.

7351
04:59:18,580 --> 04:59:21,620
I was a North American fall webworm in my past life.

7352
04:59:21,620 --> 04:59:22,080
Webworm.

7353
04:59:22,580 --> 04:59:23,840
That's what I do.

7354
04:59:24,160 --> 04:59:24,600
Oh, those were the good old days.

7355
04:59:24,920 --> 04:59:26,780
I webworm on the internet.

7356
04:59:27,200 --> 04:59:28,580
I'm a webworm.

7357
04:59:29,640 --> 04:59:30,820
I'm a webworm.

7358
04:59:31,580 --> 04:59:32,660
Oh yeah, let's stay still.

7359
04:59:36,590 --> 04:59:38,190
Let's see if we get the codec again.

7360
04:59:38,490 --> 04:59:47,050
Your mission is to infiltrate the Fortress Gallowade, rescue the hostages, and neutralize Metal Gear before its assembly is complete.

7361
04:59:49,850 --> 04:59:52,010
This part is so isome.

7362
04:59:52,190 --> 04:59:54,390
This part is so isome, man.

7363
04:59:55,990 --> 04:59:58,010
You got a PSG-1?

7364
04:59:58,270 --> 05:00:00,470
You can use that against Sniper Wolf.

7365
05:00:00,550 --> 05:00:00,990
Sniper Wolf?

7366
05:00:00,990 --> 05:00:02,430
Hurry up and save Meryl.

7367
05:00:04,390 --> 05:00:05,530
What's going on?

7368
05:00:05,610 --> 05:00:07,690
Oh my god, it's so creepy crazy!

7369
05:00:11,810 --> 05:00:12,890
Actually, I'm...

7370
05:00:13,390 --> 05:00:14,810
I'm in really bad shape financially.

7371
05:00:15,290 --> 05:00:19,790
I pay money to my ex-wife as part of our divorce settlement, among other bills.

7372
05:00:20,070 --> 05:00:23,730
I just had no choice but to make you pay for lunch the other day.

7373
05:00:24,090 --> 05:00:25,210
I'm really sorry.

7374
05:00:25,570 --> 05:00:26,290
It's okay, Colonel.

7375
05:00:27,110 --> 05:00:27,790
It's okay.

7376
05:00:27,910 --> 05:00:29,610
Who programmed that?

7377
05:00:32,070 --> 05:00:34,090
Who put that into the system?

7378
05:00:35,130 --> 05:00:38,510
Honestly, though, you have played the game for a long time.

7379
05:00:38,590 --> 05:00:39,070
We got this one.

7380
05:00:39,090 --> 05:00:40,950
Don't you have anything else to do with your time?

7381
05:00:42,110 --> 05:00:42,630
No.

7382
05:00:49,980 --> 05:00:58,520
Your mission is to infiltrate the fortress Galuwade, rescue the hostages, and neutralize Metal Gear before its assembly is complete.

7383
05:01:00,160 --> 05:01:00,680
No.

7384
05:01:04,860 --> 05:01:06,900
I think we've gotten all of them now, right?

7385
05:01:07,680 --> 05:01:08,660
Oh, I missed it.

7386
05:01:08,940 --> 05:01:09,460
Oh!

7387
05:01:09,460 --> 05:01:11,360
Even my patience has its limits.

7388
05:01:11,580 --> 05:01:13,480
Are you a real lalilulelo?

7389
05:01:13,580 --> 05:01:14,100
Yeah!

7390
05:01:14,660 --> 05:01:15,540
I'll do the fighting.

7391
05:01:15,740 --> 05:01:17,000
You can just go home.

7392
05:01:17,040 --> 05:01:18,020
You can just go home.

7393
05:01:18,020 --> 05:01:19,880
I'm in really bad shape financially.

7394
05:01:19,920 --> 05:01:22,480
I keep super chatting VTubers playing Metal Gear.

7395
05:01:30,800 --> 05:01:31,740
It's okay.

7396
05:01:31,740 --> 05:01:32,380
I like this one.

7397
05:01:32,620 --> 05:01:33,580
Okay, I think we got all of them.

7398
05:01:40,180 --> 05:01:41,140
So awesome.

7399
05:01:41,340 --> 05:01:41,620
Okay.

7400
05:01:42,020 --> 05:01:43,920
We can start ignoring the Colonel now.

7401
05:01:49,220 --> 05:01:49,960
Beep beep.

7402
05:01:55,630 --> 05:01:56,270
Hello?

7403
05:01:57,450 --> 05:01:58,090
Colonel?

7404
05:02:01,690 --> 05:02:02,330
Oh!

7405
05:02:03,110 --> 05:02:03,750
Mayling!

7406
05:02:03,850 --> 05:02:04,170
Snake.

7407
05:02:05,710 --> 05:02:07,370
Remember what the Gaul said.

7408
05:02:07,630 --> 05:02:07,970
No!

7409
05:02:10,730 --> 05:02:11,710
She's so...

7410
05:02:11,710 --> 05:02:14,470
The graveyards are full of indispensable men.

7411
05:02:17,690 --> 05:02:18,330
Mayling!

7412
05:02:18,430 --> 05:02:19,050
Mayling!

7413
05:02:19,170 --> 05:02:19,510
Mayling!

7414
05:02:19,510 --> 05:02:19,890
Snake!

7415
05:02:19,890 --> 05:02:20,050
Snake!

7416
05:02:20,250 --> 05:02:20,350
She's so cute!

7417
05:02:20,350 --> 05:02:20,370
Snake!

7418
05:02:20,610 --> 05:02:23,190
You're all alone and surrounded by bad guys.

7419
05:02:24,990 --> 05:02:28,570
Try to be careful and avoid getting into a fight whenever you can.

7420
05:02:38,030 --> 05:02:42,170
I actually don't remember when he comes here.

7421
05:02:42,610 --> 05:02:43,790
Jack, it's me.

7422
05:02:44,010 --> 05:02:44,070
Oh!

7423
05:02:44,170 --> 05:02:44,830
Hi, Rose.

7424
05:02:44,950 --> 05:02:45,170
Rose!

7425
05:02:45,250 --> 05:02:47,070
Jack, I owe you an apology.

7426
05:02:47,530 --> 05:02:49,810
If it's about that conversation just now...

7427
05:02:49,810 --> 05:02:50,130
The airplane arms?

7428
05:02:50,190 --> 05:02:50,330
I know.

7429
05:02:50,330 --> 05:02:51,190
I'm the one who's sorry.

7430
05:02:51,450 --> 05:02:51,530
She's so cute.

7431
05:02:51,710 --> 05:02:52,890
No, it's something else.

7432
05:02:52,890 --> 05:02:53,410
She's so cute.

7433
05:02:53,630 --> 05:02:54,250
What is it?

7434
05:02:54,250 --> 05:02:57,930
That day at Federal Hall two years ago...

7435
05:02:57,930 --> 05:02:58,850
Here it is.

7436
05:02:58,870 --> 05:02:59,790
It wasn't a coincidence.

7437
05:03:00,170 --> 05:03:00,610
Here it is.

7438
05:03:01,010 --> 05:03:03,230
I was ordered to keep an eye on you.

7439
05:03:03,370 --> 05:03:04,790
Keep an eye on me?

7440
05:03:05,170 --> 05:03:05,650
Yes.

7441
05:03:06,010 --> 05:03:07,250
By the Patriots.

7442
05:03:08,590 --> 05:03:09,490
You're a spy?

7443
05:03:10,610 --> 05:03:11,430
I suppose.

7444
05:03:12,150 --> 05:03:12,630
Yes.

7445
05:03:13,190 --> 05:03:14,350
It's an ugly word.

7446
05:03:17,470 --> 05:03:18,590
Are you still there?

7447
05:03:18,910 --> 05:03:19,390
Unfortunately.

7448
05:03:19,390 --> 05:03:21,010
Was sleeping with me a part of the job?

7449
05:03:21,210 --> 05:03:22,830
I fell in love with you.

7450
05:03:22,990 --> 05:03:24,010
How could anyone?

7451
05:03:24,250 --> 05:03:26,330
I can't excuse what I did.

7452
05:03:26,510 --> 05:03:30,170
I've reported every detail of your personal life to them these two years.

7453
05:03:30,370 --> 05:03:32,550
What you did, said, everything.

7454
05:03:32,970 --> 05:03:34,070
Must have been fun.

7455
05:03:34,370 --> 05:03:36,410
But some things I didn't tell anyone.

7456
05:03:37,630 --> 05:03:39,550
Like what I felt for you.

7457
05:03:39,830 --> 05:03:41,970
So that's why you were involved in this mission.

7458
05:03:42,090 --> 05:03:43,150
I should have known.

7459
05:03:43,570 --> 05:03:47,290
Why else would they toss an analyst into the mix at the last minute?

7460
05:03:47,890 --> 05:03:48,570
I'm sorry.

7461
05:03:48,750 --> 05:03:50,550
I know what I did was wrong.

7462
05:03:50,590 --> 05:03:51,410
I feel like I'm playing with dolls.

7463
05:03:51,410 --> 05:03:53,450
No matter where I go, I get used.

7464
05:03:53,450 --> 05:03:56,890
I reinvented myself to suit your tastes.

7465
05:03:57,710 --> 05:04:00,830
Hairstyle, clothes, the way I move, things I talked about.

7466
05:04:01,130 --> 05:04:04,170
You say you love the color of my hair, my eyes.

7467
05:04:04,390 --> 05:04:05,650
They're not even real.

7468
05:04:06,330 --> 05:04:10,430
You must have gone over my psych profile with a fine-tooth comb.

7469
05:04:10,870 --> 05:04:11,790
How do you change your eyes?

7470
05:04:11,810 --> 05:04:12,510
It was my job.

7471
05:04:13,310 --> 05:04:14,430
Great performance.

7472
05:04:14,990 --> 05:04:16,870
Had me completely fooled.

7473
05:04:17,370 --> 05:04:21,450
What I really wanted was for you to see the real me.

7474
05:04:21,450 --> 05:04:25,350
It hurt to play out this... this artificial romance.

7475
05:04:25,970 --> 05:04:28,610
It was worse to lie to myself than to you.

7476
05:04:28,750 --> 05:04:31,870
The more love you gave me, the more it hurt.

7477
05:04:32,270 --> 05:04:35,770
Because I knew the person you loved was just a character.

7478
05:04:36,190 --> 05:04:39,210
So it was artificial on my end, too.

7479
05:04:39,410 --> 05:04:42,570
It was just a game, not the real thing.

7480
05:04:42,990 --> 05:04:44,010
Oh, Jack.

7481
05:04:44,710 --> 05:04:45,690
Oh, Jack.

7482
05:04:45,730 --> 05:04:47,090
I feel better knowing that.

7483
05:04:47,470 --> 05:04:48,070
What?

7484
05:04:48,410 --> 05:04:51,110
I was in love, or thought I was.

7485
05:04:51,450 --> 05:04:53,030
With someone who didn't exist.

7486
05:04:53,350 --> 05:04:58,130
I was trying to be someone I wasn't by loving what wasn't real.

7487
05:04:58,470 --> 05:05:00,210
I don't know who you really are.

7488
05:05:00,350 --> 05:05:02,370
The person I knew isn't real.

7489
05:05:02,790 --> 05:05:04,970
She's not the woman I'm talking to right now.

7490
05:05:05,150 --> 05:05:09,010
In a sense, the deception was my own, not theirs.

7491
05:05:09,550 --> 05:05:13,290
Jack, I thought I was acting because that was my job.

7492
05:05:13,290 --> 05:05:14,230
I thought I was acting.

7493
05:05:14,230 --> 05:05:15,450
But I did fall in love with you.

7494
05:05:15,490 --> 05:05:16,650
That wasn't an act.

7495
05:05:16,730 --> 05:05:17,690
I mean, you were acting.

7496
05:05:17,750 --> 05:05:18,470
You expect me to believe that?

7497
05:05:18,510 --> 05:05:19,130
You saw it.

7498
05:05:19,150 --> 05:05:19,930
You were acting.

7499
05:05:19,930 --> 05:05:20,270
That's okay.

7500
05:05:20,290 --> 05:05:21,770
You had your reasons, right?

7501
05:05:21,950 --> 05:05:23,730
Hey, I understand.

7502
05:05:24,070 --> 05:05:25,990
But I have nothing left to...

7503
05:05:25,990 --> 05:05:26,330
Jack.

7504
05:05:26,870 --> 05:05:27,510
What?

7505
05:05:27,710 --> 05:05:28,270
What?

7506
05:05:28,370 --> 05:05:28,750
I'm...

7507
05:05:30,350 --> 05:05:31,630
I'm carrying...

7508
05:05:31,630 --> 05:05:33,950
I'm pregnant, Jack.

7509
05:05:35,030 --> 05:05:35,670
Rose!

7510
05:05:36,770 --> 05:05:37,410
My baby!

7511
05:05:37,410 --> 05:05:38,170
What's going on?

7512
05:05:38,930 --> 05:05:40,190
She's not a baby!

7513
05:05:40,270 --> 05:05:40,710
She's pregnant!

7514
05:05:42,610 --> 05:05:43,950
Oh, my God.

7515
05:05:45,970 --> 05:05:47,990
Amazing how you walk around like that.

7516
05:05:50,130 --> 05:05:50,670
Snake!

7517
05:05:50,930 --> 05:05:51,130
Snake!

7518
05:05:51,870 --> 05:05:52,650
I've been waiting long.

7519
05:05:57,230 --> 05:05:58,650
He's so cool!

7520
05:05:59,530 --> 05:06:00,590
I love him!

7521
05:06:02,930 --> 05:06:03,470
Poor...

7522
05:06:03,470 --> 05:06:04,510
Where's my gear?

7523
05:06:04,770 --> 05:06:05,590
Right over there.

7524
05:06:08,650 --> 05:06:09,910
There he is.

7525
05:06:11,870 --> 05:06:12,410
Yeah!

7526
05:06:13,010 --> 05:06:14,090
That's more like it.

7527
05:06:14,150 --> 05:06:14,370
Yeah!

7528
05:06:14,750 --> 05:06:17,090
Everything you had when you were captured is still there.

7529
05:06:17,310 --> 05:06:17,730
Nice.

7530
05:06:18,890 --> 05:06:19,370
Oh.

7531
05:06:20,270 --> 05:06:20,750
Nano.

7532
05:06:22,710 --> 05:06:23,530
Ass shot.

7533
05:06:23,570 --> 05:06:25,370
They can't just do that, you know?

7534
05:06:25,890 --> 05:06:28,390
Brian coming to terms with his parasocial will.

7535
05:06:28,450 --> 05:06:29,350
Sorry about earlier.

7536
05:06:29,690 --> 05:06:32,450
I had to use you as bait to gain access to Arsenal.

7537
05:06:32,710 --> 05:06:33,230
It worked.

7538
05:06:33,470 --> 05:06:33,770
What?

7539
05:06:33,770 --> 05:06:35,390
Why didn't you tell me about Olga?

7540
05:06:35,610 --> 05:06:36,270
You never asked.

7541
05:06:36,270 --> 05:06:36,710
You didn't ask?

7542
05:06:37,850 --> 05:06:39,030
Not happy about that?

7543
05:06:39,230 --> 05:06:40,210
Get over it.

7544
05:06:40,530 --> 05:06:42,350
Any effects of the virus yet?

7545
05:06:42,470 --> 05:06:43,750
Still waiting on that.

7546
05:06:44,170 --> 05:06:44,430
Oh, my God.

7547
05:06:44,450 --> 05:06:44,530
Look at his bedding.

7548
05:06:44,530 --> 05:06:44,550
Look at his ear.

7549
05:06:44,550 --> 05:06:46,750
So, it was rigged by the Patriots?

7550
05:06:46,770 --> 05:06:47,170
Look at his nose.

7551
05:06:47,170 --> 05:06:47,290
His mouth.

7552
05:06:47,290 --> 05:06:47,710
Looks like it.

7553
05:06:47,730 --> 05:06:50,770
From what I can tell, Arsenal is headed for Manhattan.

7554
05:06:51,070 --> 05:06:51,210
No.

7555
05:06:51,310 --> 05:06:54,790
I don't know what Solidus is planning, but we'll have to deal with it one way or another.

7556
05:06:55,070 --> 05:06:55,310
Right.

7557
05:06:55,310 --> 05:06:57,590
There's also a troupe of production model Rays ahead.

7558
05:06:58,070 --> 05:06:59,050
How many units?

7559
05:06:59,350 --> 05:07:00,830
Twenty-five, according to Olga.

7560
05:07:00,830 --> 05:07:01,470
Hey, come on.

7561
05:07:01,470 --> 05:07:02,330
Twenty-five?

7562
05:07:02,490 --> 05:07:03,350
Twenty-five?

7563
05:07:03,450 --> 05:07:03,850
Yeah.

7564
05:07:03,850 --> 05:07:05,870
Can't say I've faced that many Metal Gears before.

7565
05:07:06,270 --> 05:07:07,950
But I think we can deal.

7566
05:07:07,970 --> 05:07:08,370
No way we can.

7567
05:07:08,370 --> 05:07:09,430
You're gonna be the one...

7568
05:07:09,430 --> 05:07:11,210
You're the one who's gonna be facing it, right?

7569
05:07:11,250 --> 05:07:12,290
Because we have no other choice.

7570
05:07:12,310 --> 05:07:12,650
Right, Snake?

7571
05:07:12,730 --> 05:07:13,870
You're the one who's gonna be facing them.

7572
05:07:13,870 --> 05:07:13,970
How?

7573
05:07:13,970 --> 05:07:15,490
I've stocked up on Stinger missiles.

7574
05:07:15,790 --> 05:07:15,990
Okay.

7575
05:07:16,130 --> 05:07:16,450
Oh, yeah.

7576
05:07:16,630 --> 05:07:18,030
Olga left this for you.

7577
05:07:18,710 --> 05:07:20,910
Funny-er the twenty-er.

7578
05:07:21,030 --> 05:07:22,070
Funny-er the twenty-four.

7579
05:07:23,050 --> 05:07:24,090
Twenty-five.

7580
05:07:24,470 --> 05:07:25,110
What's the...

7581
05:07:25,110 --> 05:07:25,610
Oh.

7582
05:07:26,190 --> 05:07:27,330
Thanks, Olga.

7583
05:07:30,870 --> 05:07:31,430
Thanks.

7584
05:07:31,810 --> 05:07:32,370
Why?

7585
05:07:33,310 --> 05:07:35,210
Olga asked me to give it to you.

7586
05:07:35,270 --> 05:07:37,530
Besides, I'm not a big fan of blades.

7587
05:07:38,550 --> 05:07:40,570
Ask about the bandana, Ryden.

7588
05:07:40,770 --> 05:07:42,370
Ask about the bandana.

7589
05:07:43,850 --> 05:07:45,390
Ask about the bandana.

7590
05:07:46,210 --> 05:07:47,710
Jack is back, baby!

7591
05:07:49,210 --> 05:07:55,790
Move the right analog stick up and down to make a vertical slice, and left and right to slice parallel to the ground.

7592
05:07:57,470 --> 05:08:00,630
Move the stick in a circle to do a rotating cut.

7593
05:08:02,430 --> 05:08:05,130
Push it forward to lunge and strike.

7594
05:08:06,630 --> 05:08:10,790
You can guard with your blade if you have the L1 button pressed down.

7595
05:08:11,390 --> 05:08:14,050
You should be able to deflect a bullet or two.

7596
05:08:21,700 --> 05:08:22,740
Okay, hook!

7597
05:08:24,220 --> 05:08:26,160
Up, down, up, down, up!

7598
05:08:31,940 --> 05:08:34,080
He's gonna stand there or...

7599
05:08:36,980 --> 05:08:38,160
Oops, sorry, stay.

7600
05:08:38,300 --> 05:08:40,880
God, don't be so dramatic about it.

7601
05:08:43,580 --> 05:08:45,700
He watched anime, yeah.

7602
05:08:46,040 --> 05:08:47,100
No, no, no, hold on!

7603
05:08:47,420 --> 05:08:48,980
Don't turn and look at me, please!

7604
05:08:50,380 --> 05:08:51,140
I'm embarrassed.

7605
05:08:53,240 --> 05:08:53,760
Okay.

7606
05:08:56,160 --> 05:08:57,880
And then when I run, too...

7607
05:08:58,420 --> 05:09:01,420
Can I deflect bullets when I run, or is that...

7608
05:09:05,380 --> 05:09:06,520
Kill snake!

7609
05:09:08,180 --> 05:09:10,920
Oh my goodness.

7610
05:09:11,260 --> 05:09:11,580
Okay.

7611
05:09:11,800 --> 05:09:12,900
Oh, uh, wait.

7612
05:09:13,040 --> 05:09:13,860
It was, uh...

7613
05:09:13,860 --> 05:09:16,120
Oh, that's the jab.

7614
05:09:16,700 --> 05:09:17,760
Jab, jab, jab.

7615
05:09:25,250 --> 05:09:26,570
Wow, thank you!

7616
05:09:26,730 --> 05:09:29,630
This was the day Saucy Binto was born.

7617
05:09:32,570 --> 05:09:34,510
Thank you, Ilfried, thank you!

7618
05:09:34,950 --> 05:09:36,350
Also, Yanwei, thank you.

7619
05:09:36,470 --> 05:09:38,310
Rose acts weird and needy and possessive.

7620
05:09:38,330 --> 05:09:41,390
Rose is also trying to play the role of Jack's ideal girl.

7621
05:09:41,610 --> 05:09:43,890
I guess he's into deeply problematic women.

7622
05:09:44,390 --> 05:09:45,410
I guess so.

7623
05:09:46,950 --> 05:09:47,690
Oh, sorry.

7624
05:09:48,170 --> 05:09:49,230
Just wanna...

7625
05:09:50,330 --> 05:09:50,970
Oh my god.

7626
05:09:51,810 --> 05:09:53,750
Whoa, he's breathing in my...

7627
05:09:53,750 --> 05:09:55,510
We're so close, I can...

7628
05:09:55,510 --> 05:09:57,410
He's fogging up my glasses!

7629
05:09:59,430 --> 05:10:01,210
He's fogging up my glasses!

7630
05:10:01,210 --> 05:10:03,030
No way!

7631
05:10:03,630 --> 05:10:04,510
Wowee.

7632
05:10:05,030 --> 05:10:06,810
You look so cool, snake.

7633
05:10:08,050 --> 05:10:09,790
I love the floor in this area.

7634
05:10:11,110 --> 05:10:12,010
So awesome.

7635
05:10:12,970 --> 05:10:14,750
Oh, I guess that's it.

7636
05:10:16,750 --> 05:10:17,630
Hi!

7637
05:10:20,790 --> 05:10:22,550
You weeb.

7638
05:10:25,670 --> 05:10:26,470
Oh, that's...

7639
05:10:30,470 --> 05:10:31,790
Infinite ammo.

7640
05:10:31,790 --> 05:10:31,870
Infinite ammo.

7641
05:10:34,150 --> 05:10:35,330
Wait up, snake.

7642
05:10:35,810 --> 05:10:37,730
I swore I'd thank you for the tech gift, dude.

7643
05:10:38,170 --> 05:10:39,190
I love that.

7644
05:10:39,630 --> 05:10:41,430
I love that line so much.

7645
05:10:41,630 --> 05:10:42,430
Infinite ammo.

7646
05:10:43,370 --> 05:10:46,610
Snake, have you ever enjoyed killing someone?

7647
05:10:47,010 --> 05:10:48,110
What are you talking about?

7648
05:10:48,430 --> 05:10:49,350
I'm not sure.

7649
05:10:49,390 --> 05:10:49,870
Me too.

7650
05:10:50,070 --> 05:10:53,810
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between reality and a game.

7651
05:10:54,290 --> 05:10:55,870
Diminished sense of reality, huh?

7652
05:10:56,190 --> 05:10:57,170
VR training will do that.

7653
05:10:57,170 --> 05:10:58,910
Do you guys mind if I get food before we continue?

7654
05:10:59,110 --> 05:10:59,250
No.

7655
05:10:59,250 --> 05:11:00,570
It was field training when I was a kid.

7656
05:11:00,570 --> 05:11:01,910
I lied, snake.

7657
05:11:02,030 --> 05:11:03,230
We only have a little bit left of the game.

7658
05:11:03,250 --> 05:11:04,670
I have more field experience than I can remember.

7659
05:11:04,990 --> 05:11:07,210
It's not VR that's doing this to me.

7660
05:11:07,670 --> 05:11:10,650
Raiden, we don't carry guns to take people down.

7661
05:11:10,990 --> 05:11:13,070
We're not here to help some politician either.

7662
05:11:13,390 --> 05:11:15,490
You can say that because you're a legend.

7663
05:11:15,590 --> 05:11:16,310
A hero.

7664
05:11:16,910 --> 05:11:18,190
I'm Jack the Ripper.

7665
05:11:18,330 --> 05:11:18,930
I'm Jack the Ripper.

7666
05:11:18,930 --> 05:11:21,330
A dirty reminder of a terrible mistake.

7667
05:11:22,030 --> 05:11:22,470
Jack is back.

7668
05:11:22,470 --> 05:11:23,530
Legends don't mean a whole lot.

7669
05:11:23,690 --> 05:11:25,290
I was just a name to exploit.

7670
05:11:25,650 --> 05:11:26,550
Just like you.

7671
05:11:27,090 --> 05:11:29,170
People will remember only the good part.

7672
05:11:29,350 --> 05:11:30,530
The right part of what you've done.

7673
05:11:30,530 --> 05:11:30,550
Jack is back.

7674
05:11:31,210 --> 05:11:32,890
There's no right part in murder.

7675
05:11:33,130 --> 05:11:33,870
Not ever.

7676
05:11:34,130 --> 05:11:36,410
And we're not in this to make a name for ourselves.

7677
05:11:36,950 --> 05:11:39,490
And what are you and Otacon fighting for?

7678
05:11:39,970 --> 05:11:40,770
A future.

7679
05:11:41,170 --> 05:11:42,990
You can stop being part of a mistake.

7680
05:11:43,430 --> 05:11:44,250
Starting now.

7681
05:11:44,510 --> 05:11:45,550
Sorry, serious conversation.

7682
05:11:45,950 --> 05:11:46,110
What am I?

7683
05:11:46,110 --> 05:11:46,910
What am I supposed to do?

7684
05:11:49,250 --> 05:11:50,190
Just change.

7685
05:11:50,350 --> 05:11:51,510
Just be a better guy.

7686
05:11:51,970 --> 05:11:52,990
Have some of your ammo.

7687
05:11:53,090 --> 05:11:54,330
Find something to believe in.

7688
05:11:54,370 --> 05:11:55,450
And find it for yourself.

7689
05:11:55,770 --> 05:11:57,730
And when you do, pass it on to the future.

7690
05:11:58,690 --> 05:11:59,690
Believe in what?

7691
05:12:00,050 --> 05:12:00,530
The future.

7692
05:12:00,550 --> 05:12:01,290
That's your problem.

7693
05:12:02,990 --> 05:12:03,790
Come on.

7694
05:12:04,190 --> 05:12:04,850
Oh gosh.

7695
05:12:05,010 --> 05:12:06,430
They're gonna put us mid-fight, aren't they?

7696
05:12:06,730 --> 05:12:08,830
I'm just gonna have to pause it and go get food.

7697
05:12:10,890 --> 05:12:11,290
Oh.

7698
05:12:12,170 --> 05:12:12,570
Maybe?

7699
05:12:14,470 --> 05:12:14,870
Snake.

7700
05:12:15,190 --> 05:12:15,590
Riding.

7701
05:12:15,950 --> 05:12:16,350
Otacon.

7702
05:12:16,630 --> 05:12:17,410
You all right?

7703
05:12:17,550 --> 05:12:17,930
Yeah.

7704
05:12:18,130 --> 05:12:19,430
So we're all the hostages.

7705
05:12:19,670 --> 05:12:20,510
That's good news.

7706
05:12:20,610 --> 05:12:20,810
Yippee.

7707
05:12:20,930 --> 05:12:22,190
How's everything on your end?

7708
05:12:22,490 --> 05:12:23,250
All right for now.

7709
05:12:23,550 --> 05:12:24,710
But there is something.

7710
05:12:24,990 --> 05:12:25,550
It's quiet.

7711
05:12:26,090 --> 05:12:26,250
What?

7712
05:12:26,250 --> 05:12:27,370
The colonel's last transmission.

7713
05:12:27,630 --> 05:12:27,790
Oh.

7714
05:12:27,870 --> 05:12:28,370
It was strange.

7715
05:12:28,850 --> 05:12:30,030
Uh, transmissions.

7716
05:12:30,030 --> 05:12:30,390
How?

7717
05:12:30,510 --> 05:12:30,530
I don't know.

7718
05:12:30,550 --> 05:12:32,050
Just strange.

7719
05:12:32,410 --> 05:12:33,250
No idea.

7720
05:12:34,210 --> 05:12:34,670
Interference?

7721
05:12:34,870 --> 05:12:35,290
I don't know.

7722
05:12:35,290 --> 05:12:36,270
Find a new VTuber.

7723
05:12:36,290 --> 05:12:37,130
Where is this colonel?

7724
05:12:37,210 --> 05:12:38,330
I don't know.

7725
05:12:38,610 --> 05:12:40,230
I've never met the man, actually.

7726
05:12:40,930 --> 05:12:41,790
I'll dig around.

7727
05:12:42,310 --> 05:12:42,770
Thanks.

7728
05:12:42,910 --> 05:12:43,830
I owe you one.

7729
05:12:43,990 --> 05:12:44,190
Yeah.

7730
05:12:44,350 --> 05:12:46,490
If there's anything else, call me on the codec.

7731
05:12:46,550 --> 05:12:47,650
I might be able to help.

7732
05:12:47,810 --> 05:12:50,470
The frequency is 141.12.

7733
05:12:50,770 --> 05:12:51,750
141.12.

7734
05:12:56,390 --> 05:12:57,730
Potatoes ready on my desk.

7735
05:12:58,590 --> 05:12:59,510
Uh-oh.

7736
05:12:59,850 --> 05:13:00,310
Uh-oh.

7737
05:13:00,310 --> 05:13:00,470
Uh -oh.

7738
05:13:01,590 --> 05:13:02,070
Oh no.

7739
05:13:03,830 --> 05:13:05,730
I should become a ninja cyborg.

7740
05:13:06,370 --> 05:13:06,850
Um.

7741
05:13:11,290 --> 05:13:11,770
Yeah.

7742
05:13:11,850 --> 05:13:12,350
About that.

7743
05:13:13,550 --> 05:13:14,930
I'm gonna go get food real quick.

7744
05:13:17,010 --> 05:13:17,870
I'll be...

7745
05:13:17,870 --> 05:13:19,410
You guys can listen to this.

7746
05:13:19,770 --> 05:13:21,090
I'll turn it down a little bit.

7747
05:13:22,850 --> 05:13:24,410
I have some food ready.

7748
05:13:26,450 --> 05:13:29,230
So I'm just gonna grab a plate and I'm gonna...

7749
05:13:29,230 --> 05:13:29,450
Oh.

7750
05:13:30,050 --> 05:13:30,530
I have some food ready.

7751
05:13:30,530 --> 05:13:32,230
Eat for a second.

7752
05:13:32,410 --> 05:13:34,650
A little snack time for a second.

7753
05:13:34,730 --> 05:13:36,030
Sorry, I'm starting to get really hungry.

7754
05:13:36,270 --> 05:13:39,130
And I don't want to do the fights while I'm on an empty stomach.

7755
05:13:39,390 --> 05:13:40,910
And I gotta get some more water.

7756
05:13:41,150 --> 05:13:42,870
So I'll be right back.

7757
05:13:43,690 --> 05:13:44,510
I'll be right back.

7758
05:13:44,590 --> 05:13:44,930
I'll be right back.

7759
05:13:45,510 --> 05:13:46,210
Thanks guys!

7760
05:13:46,630 --> 05:13:47,130
We are back!

7761
05:13:51,150 --> 05:13:57,030
Your mission is to destroy the shagohan, eat some tasty animals like the purple stuffed worm.

7762
05:13:57,030 --> 05:13:58,270
Variety level 16.

7763
05:13:58,490 --> 05:13:59,010
Tasty!

7764
05:13:59,990 --> 05:14:00,930
Thanks, Colonel!

7765
05:14:03,810 --> 05:14:04,930
Oh, I want to fly.

7766
05:14:05,510 --> 05:14:06,610
Okay, here we go.

7767
05:17:35,470 --> 05:17:37,230
Sorry for the wait.

7768
05:17:37,350 --> 05:17:38,230
So sorry.

7769
05:17:38,910 --> 05:17:39,750
I'm back.

7770
05:17:40,050 --> 05:17:41,090
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

7771
05:17:41,790 --> 05:17:42,930
Bye bye spaghetti!

7772
05:17:48,640 --> 05:17:56,740
I'm gonna turn down the music just a little bit so we're not eating in battle music and stuff.

7773
05:17:59,000 --> 05:18:00,100
Yay, you were the gifted!

7774
05:18:00,760 --> 05:18:01,860
That's one, thank you!

7775
05:18:08,310 --> 05:18:10,190
I'm starting to get so hungry though.

7776
05:18:10,770 --> 05:18:11,250
Glad.

7777
05:18:11,930 --> 05:18:15,570
Good spot to... maybe not the best spot, but...

7778
05:18:15,570 --> 05:18:19,130
A decent... well, we only have this area?

7779
05:18:19,390 --> 05:18:20,910
We don't have so much left, honestly.

7780
05:18:26,080 --> 05:18:28,020
Just a few more battle sequences and...

7781
05:18:28,920 --> 05:18:29,440
That's it?

7782
05:18:33,140 --> 05:18:34,340
You deserve it, thank you!

7783
05:18:34,840 --> 05:18:35,320
Yeah!

7784
05:18:35,360 --> 05:18:36,140
Yeah, I think we'll be able to...

7785
05:18:36,140 --> 05:18:37,840
I think we'll be able to...

7786
05:18:39,160 --> 05:18:40,640
finish today... tonight.

7787
05:18:44,260 --> 05:18:45,640
Yeah, then movie time.

7788
05:18:45,820 --> 05:18:46,160
So true.

7789
05:18:50,320 --> 05:18:53,640
Though I'm worried about the Metal Gear fight.

7790
05:18:58,650 --> 05:19:00,470
Little worried about Metal Gear fight.

7791
05:19:00,950 --> 05:19:03,530
But I'll do my... my minto best.

7792
05:19:05,430 --> 05:19:08,550
Few more big fights and about an hour of Brain Rock cutscene.

7793
05:19:08,550 --> 05:19:09,190
Spaghet!

7794
05:19:11,170 --> 05:19:13,710
Wish I could eat this while they were doing the cutscene.

7795
05:19:13,930 --> 05:19:14,470
But, you know...

7796
05:19:14,470 --> 05:19:15,170
That's fine.

7797
05:19:23,320 --> 05:19:24,480
We're on normal difficulty.

7798
05:19:26,000 --> 05:19:26,440
So...

7799
05:19:27,340 --> 05:19:29,240
I don't exactly remember how many.

7800
05:19:31,220 --> 05:19:31,940
Minto best?

7801
05:19:32,060 --> 05:19:32,520
Yeah, she is.

7802
05:19:35,080 --> 05:19:36,720
I think it's a...

7803
05:19:38,880 --> 05:19:39,320
Mmm...

7804
05:19:42,780 --> 05:19:44,600
I think it was eight, right?

7805
05:19:44,820 --> 05:19:45,840
I thought it was eight.

7806
05:19:47,920 --> 05:19:49,240
Seven or eight, yeah.

7807
05:19:49,880 --> 05:19:51,280
I think it's eight of them.

7808
05:19:51,580 --> 05:19:53,540
So, for anybody curious...

7809
05:19:53,540 --> 05:19:55,920
Remember how they mentioned the 25 Metal Gears?

7810
05:19:56,980 --> 05:19:57,540
Well...

7811
05:19:58,340 --> 05:20:01,280
In the harder difficulties, you'd have to fight all 25.

7812
05:20:02,600 --> 05:20:03,160
But...

7813
05:20:04,020 --> 05:20:08,160
And I believe Kojima probably wanted that to be the case across the board.

7814
05:20:08,960 --> 05:20:11,940
But in the lesser ones, it's only...

7815
05:20:12,860 --> 05:20:13,980
It's only...

7816
05:20:13,980 --> 05:20:14,440
Uh...

7817
05:20:15,520 --> 05:20:16,000
Um...

7818
05:20:17,440 --> 05:20:18,400
It's only...

7819
05:20:18,400 --> 05:20:19,280
Uh...

7820
05:20:19,880 --> 05:20:20,820
Eight, I believe.

7821
05:20:24,360 --> 05:20:24,840
Mmm...

7822
05:20:28,280 --> 05:20:30,820
But the timing for it is pretty difficult for me.

7823
05:20:30,880 --> 05:20:31,360
So...

7824
05:20:33,700 --> 05:20:34,720
You do it on hard?

7825
05:20:34,860 --> 05:20:35,040
No!

7826
05:20:36,200 --> 05:20:36,880
Golly, no!

7827
05:20:38,160 --> 05:20:41,520
No, no, no.

7828
05:20:41,620 --> 05:20:41,840
No, no, no.

7829
05:20:42,160 --> 05:20:42,640
No, no, no.

7830
05:20:49,860 --> 05:20:50,700
You picked up the body armor.

7831
05:20:50,780 --> 05:20:51,080
I did!

7832
05:20:51,180 --> 05:20:52,200
I did get the body armor.

7833
05:20:52,320 --> 05:20:52,660
You're right.

7834
05:20:52,900 --> 05:20:54,960
And that's huge for that fight.

7835
05:21:02,500 --> 05:21:03,620
Leg then face.

7836
05:21:04,080 --> 05:21:05,100
Leg then face.

7837
05:21:11,040 --> 05:21:12,980
Your reflexes have gotten so much better for this game.

7838
05:21:13,360 --> 05:21:13,920
Thank you!

7839
05:21:15,900 --> 05:21:16,780
Thank you, thank you!

7840
05:21:22,420 --> 05:21:23,540
We've been powering through.

7841
05:21:25,480 --> 05:21:26,420
Oh, it's only six?

7842
05:21:29,460 --> 05:21:30,860
No Pequod to help you.

7843
05:21:31,000 --> 05:21:32,400
I miss that guy so much.

7844
05:21:35,140 --> 05:21:36,980
Metal Gear Solid V, I wait for you.

7845
05:21:37,440 --> 05:21:38,480
Just for Pequod.

7846
05:21:50,530 --> 05:21:52,990
Do you ever wonder if Raiden was given BB cells?

7847
05:21:53,270 --> 05:21:55,270
Like the Genome Soldiers that Liquid talked about.

7848
05:21:56,790 --> 05:21:58,070
I don't think he was though.

7849
05:21:58,450 --> 05:22:00,190
Because their whole thing was...

7850
05:22:00,190 --> 05:22:03,030
Trying to raise a soldier like Big Boss?

7851
05:22:05,250 --> 05:22:06,490
Without it being him.

7852
05:22:09,850 --> 05:22:10,370
Like...

7853
05:22:10,950 --> 05:22:13,150
They wanted to see if...

7854
05:22:13,150 --> 05:22:18,210
If a person raised on a battlefield would turn out like Big Boss.

7855
05:22:26,640 --> 05:22:27,520
Is that spoilers?

7856
05:22:28,180 --> 05:22:30,980
We already know that he was raised as a child soldier.

7857
05:22:40,060 --> 05:22:40,820
A child soldier...

7858
05:22:40,820 --> 05:22:41,600
Exp boost-the-children.

7859
05:22:43,040 --> 05:22:44,660
My new kitten likes watching your streams.

7860
05:22:47,120 --> 05:22:49,180
Ignore the blue super- No, I won't ignore.

7861
05:22:53,600 --> 05:22:54,060
But..

7862
05:22:54,060 --> 05:22:54,520
yeah.

7863
05:22:56,140 --> 05:22:57,560
Install mods for MGS5.

7864
05:22:57,720 --> 05:22:57,860
No!

7865
05:22:57,980 --> 05:22:59,060
I plan on it, actually.

7866
05:23:00,140 --> 05:23:01,940
I'll be playing on the PC this time.

7867
05:23:02,160 --> 05:23:02,620
But I think.

7868
05:23:03,180 --> 05:23:03,640
Okay.

7869
05:23:04,540 --> 05:23:05,000
Okay.

7870
05:23:05,840 --> 05:23:07,340
Don't judge me for some of these.

7871
05:23:07,540 --> 05:23:07,960
I don't know.

7872
05:23:08,000 --> 05:23:12,400
Because I've played through the game before, I might install some quality of life things.

7873
05:23:14,300 --> 05:23:15,100
I don't know.

7874
05:23:15,160 --> 05:23:22,020
Maybe like the ones where you don't have to wait for items to be developed and also...

7875
05:23:22,820 --> 05:23:27,300
Like the one where if you grab a soldier, he's already S++ tier.

7876
05:23:35,230 --> 05:23:36,350
Just stuff like that.

7877
05:23:43,780 --> 05:23:44,740
It's not cheating.

7878
05:23:44,760 --> 05:23:45,880
I already beat the game.

7879
05:23:49,440 --> 05:23:52,160
But also, if you guys have any interesting mods...

7880
05:23:55,880 --> 05:23:56,780
Remove the grind.

7881
05:23:56,980 --> 05:23:58,180
Yeah, that's basically...

7882
05:23:59,140 --> 05:24:01,080
The biggest issue with it, you know?

7883
05:24:06,880 --> 05:24:07,840
Like the gotcha.

7884
05:24:08,740 --> 05:24:14,300
Yeah, but don't you need... The only thing is to unlock certain things, you need a certain level, don't you?

7885
05:24:16,120 --> 05:24:18,000
With the soldiers, so it's kind of like...

7886
05:24:18,000 --> 05:24:18,900
Oh, well, to unlock...

7887
05:24:18,920 --> 05:24:20,520
I just need an S soldier.

7888
05:24:26,160 --> 05:24:28,120
A lot of deeply unserious mods.

7889
05:24:28,260 --> 05:24:28,640
Oh my god.

7890
05:24:31,800 --> 05:24:32,700
I want those.

7891
05:24:33,900 --> 05:24:35,260
Oh yeah, the music tape!

7892
05:24:37,080 --> 05:24:39,960
I wonder what song we should put as our... as P-Quad.

7893
05:24:44,250 --> 05:24:45,870
Sorry, I'm almost done with my food.

7894
05:24:53,440 --> 05:24:55,260
Oh yes, the mod that... Wait.

7895
05:24:55,480 --> 05:24:59,020
Yes, I've seen... I know about the mod that replaces D-Dog with Ocelot.

7896
05:24:59,840 --> 05:25:01,000
Or was it Khaj?

7897
05:25:01,980 --> 05:25:04,260
Get the mod that replaces D-Dog with Ocelot.

7898
05:25:04,340 --> 05:25:08,540
I've never seen it, so don't like tag me in it or anything, but I've heard about it.

7899
05:25:09,240 --> 05:25:10,800
People have told me to get it.

7900
05:25:11,380 --> 05:25:12,840
They were like, you should have that one.

7901
05:25:20,010 --> 05:25:21,550
I don't even know what Metal Gear is?

7902
05:25:24,850 --> 05:25:27,450
I hope you're enjoying the stream.

7903
05:25:32,030 --> 05:25:32,510
Um...

7904
05:25:35,710 --> 05:25:36,190
Um...

7905
05:25:42,150 --> 05:25:43,590
Planning on streaming the other MGS?

7906
05:25:43,790 --> 05:25:43,970
Yeah!

7907
05:25:45,550 --> 05:25:47,310
Between some games, I might take a break.

7908
05:25:48,290 --> 05:25:52,510
Just so I can tackle some other game series that I want to do.

7909
05:26:04,280 --> 05:26:07,440
Like maybe after 3 or 4?

7910
05:26:10,080 --> 05:26:11,340
Might take a small break.

7911
05:26:12,180 --> 05:26:13,220
Maybe after 4.

7912
05:26:13,440 --> 05:26:14,820
Because that kind of completes the timeline.

7913
05:26:25,760 --> 05:26:29,040
I think after 3, I'll immediately want to go into 4.

7914
05:26:29,240 --> 05:26:31,480
So probably after 4 is when I'll take a break.

7915
05:26:37,870 --> 05:26:38,770
No, my...

7916
05:26:39,430 --> 05:26:41,250
My breadstick got kind of hard.

7917
05:26:47,190 --> 05:26:50,110
Sorry Raiden, I must be in peak spaghetti condition.

7918
05:26:50,890 --> 05:26:51,370
Mint.

7919
05:26:51,590 --> 05:26:52,170
That's me!

7920
05:26:53,610 --> 05:26:54,130
Mentally.

7921
05:27:03,630 --> 05:27:05,150
Play Metal Gear Rising again?

7922
05:27:05,250 --> 05:27:05,730
Of course!

7923
05:27:08,370 --> 05:27:09,830
That's the one I have to play the most.

7924
05:27:10,870 --> 05:27:11,390
Because...

7925
05:27:11,390 --> 05:27:13,030
Now I'll understand it.

7926
05:27:15,790 --> 05:27:18,190
For context, I played Metal Gear Rising first.

7927
05:27:20,730 --> 05:27:21,570
And uh...

7928
05:27:21,570 --> 05:27:23,010
I was like, what's going on?

7929
05:27:24,730 --> 05:27:25,890
Who are these people?

7930
05:27:30,390 --> 05:27:32,770
Now, I'll understand who these people are.

7931
05:27:32,890 --> 05:27:33,210
Kind of.

7932
05:27:33,230 --> 05:27:33,490
Mostly.

7933
05:27:33,650 --> 05:27:34,190
Most of them.

7934
05:27:36,350 --> 05:27:37,370
Some of them.

7935
05:27:39,130 --> 05:27:40,250
Not very many...

7936
05:27:40,770 --> 05:27:44,250
Not very many people that are reoccurring from the original series.

7937
05:28:00,000 --> 05:28:00,940
Oh my god, you guys.

7938
05:28:00,980 --> 05:28:03,720
I got to hear Rules of Nature live at MGSCon.

7939
05:28:07,120 --> 05:28:08,320
And Sam's Theme.

7940
05:28:09,160 --> 05:28:09,880
What's it called?

7941
05:28:10,020 --> 05:28:11,080
Oh gosh, I can't remember.

7942
05:28:11,260 --> 05:28:11,760
I just remembered.

7943
05:28:12,060 --> 05:28:13,660
There will be blood!

7944
05:28:13,940 --> 05:28:14,420
Blood!

7945
05:28:14,900 --> 05:28:15,380
Shed!

7946
05:28:15,740 --> 05:28:16,220
Shed!

7947
05:28:17,680 --> 05:28:18,800
It was so awesome!

7948
05:28:19,240 --> 05:28:20,340
I was headbanging.

7949
05:28:20,340 --> 05:28:20,840
I was like...

7950
05:28:31,120 --> 05:28:32,600
It was so awesome.

7951
05:28:36,920 --> 05:28:38,280
The only thing I know for real.

7952
05:28:38,500 --> 05:28:38,860
Yeah!

7953
05:28:38,860 --> 05:28:39,140
Yeah!

7954
05:28:39,160 --> 05:28:39,420
Yeah!

7955
05:28:39,420 --> 05:28:39,660
Yeah!

7956
05:28:40,020 --> 05:28:40,180
Yeah!

7957
05:28:40,180 --> 05:28:40,380
Yeah!

7958
05:28:44,620 --> 05:28:45,100
Yeah!

7959
05:28:45,100 --> 05:28:45,220
Okay.

7960
05:28:45,240 --> 05:28:46,120
I'm so sorry, you guys.

7961
05:28:46,200 --> 05:28:46,620
I'm so sorry.

7962
05:28:46,840 --> 05:28:48,040
I'm taking a long time to eat.

7963
05:28:56,460 --> 05:28:58,780
Jason Charles Miller looks like a video game character.

7964
05:28:59,700 --> 05:29:00,960
He looks so awesome.

7965
05:29:01,820 --> 05:29:03,080
He looks like my uncle.

7966
05:29:10,450 --> 05:29:12,150
When my uncle was in a biker game.

7967
05:29:17,060 --> 05:29:18,520
They made us watch VTubers.

7968
05:29:18,820 --> 05:29:20,300
The kinds with maids and karaoke.

7969
05:29:20,700 --> 05:29:23,360
I still remember the taste of mint they mixed into the food.

7970
05:29:27,280 --> 05:29:27,720
Yes.

7971
05:29:28,420 --> 05:29:28,860
Okay.

7972
05:29:29,280 --> 05:29:29,880
Nom nom.

7973
05:29:31,260 --> 05:29:33,460
It's cute hearing the plate and the stuff talking.

7974
05:29:35,360 --> 05:29:35,800
Stop!

7975
05:29:36,280 --> 05:29:36,840
Oh gosh.

7976
05:29:36,960 --> 05:29:39,140
My desk is covered in postcards.

7977
05:29:39,140 --> 05:29:41,320
So I don't have a place to put my plate.

7978
05:29:43,480 --> 05:29:45,180
I don't think a cat followed me in.

7979
05:29:45,280 --> 05:29:46,240
So I'm just going to put it on the ground.

7980
05:29:48,960 --> 05:29:49,400
Okay.

7981
05:29:52,040 --> 05:29:52,860
Memories broken.

7982
05:29:53,140 --> 05:29:54,660
The truth goes unspoken.

7983
05:29:54,900 --> 05:29:55,800
I can't even remember.

7984
05:29:55,820 --> 05:29:57,080
I can't even remember my game.

7985
05:29:59,520 --> 05:30:00,120
Okay.

7986
05:30:00,240 --> 05:30:01,300
She lives like this.

7987
05:30:01,480 --> 05:30:02,840
I have so many postcards.

7988
05:30:05,200 --> 05:30:06,040
So many.

7989
05:30:06,080 --> 05:30:06,440
So many.

7990
05:30:06,940 --> 05:30:08,280
I have like...

7991
05:30:11,600 --> 05:30:14,840
Almost 5,000 postcards to sign.

7992
05:30:15,580 --> 05:30:17,960
And then I have the last months or the...

7993
05:30:17,960 --> 05:30:19,980
Like I've ordered almost all of them.

7994
05:30:20,000 --> 05:30:21,020
Except one month.

7995
05:30:22,800 --> 05:30:23,400
So...

7996
05:30:36,550 --> 05:30:37,590
Is that for one month?

7997
05:30:37,710 --> 05:30:38,310
No, no, no.

7998
05:30:38,390 --> 05:30:39,950
That's for five months.

7999
05:30:41,710 --> 05:30:42,850
Well, it would have been less.

8000
05:30:42,930 --> 05:30:44,230
It would have been just 4,000.

8001
05:30:46,130 --> 05:30:47,190
But Matara and I...

8002
05:30:47,190 --> 05:30:48,950
This is for the podcast Patreon, by the way.

8003
05:30:48,970 --> 05:30:49,930
For anyone wondering.

8004
05:30:51,150 --> 05:30:53,470
One of the tiers is we send an autographed...

8005
05:30:53,470 --> 05:30:56,450
A hand signed postcard.

8006
05:30:57,970 --> 05:30:58,330
And...

8007
05:31:00,810 --> 05:31:02,310
Is this the original PS2 version?

8008
05:31:02,490 --> 05:31:02,750
Yes.

8009
05:31:02,770 --> 05:31:04,130
This is the original PS2 version.

8010
05:31:04,190 --> 05:31:04,510
Okay.

8011
05:31:04,810 --> 05:31:04,970
Okay.

8012
05:31:06,490 --> 05:31:06,930
So...

8013
05:31:06,930 --> 05:31:10,670
We have been really bad about sending them out.

8014
05:31:11,330 --> 05:31:13,750
Because it's hard for us to meet up and sign them.

8015
05:31:14,370 --> 05:31:14,810
So...

8016
05:31:15,250 --> 05:31:16,290
I've been signing some.

8017
05:31:16,430 --> 05:31:18,290
And then I'm gonna give them to Matara at Otakutan.

8018
05:31:18,690 --> 05:31:20,030
And then I'm gonna...

8019
05:31:21,690 --> 05:31:22,570
Sign some more.

8020
05:31:22,730 --> 05:31:24,110
And bring them with me to Japan.

8021
05:31:24,690 --> 05:31:25,570
And then...

8022
05:31:25,570 --> 05:31:27,350
Probably mail her the rest of them.

8023
05:31:30,490 --> 05:31:30,930
But...

8024
05:31:32,830 --> 05:31:33,270
But...

8025
05:31:33,270 --> 05:31:33,510
I'm...

8026
05:31:34,510 --> 05:31:34,950
I'm...

8027
05:31:34,950 --> 05:31:35,670
What was I saying?

8028
05:31:36,250 --> 05:31:36,910
Oh, yeah.

8029
05:31:36,990 --> 05:31:37,810
We decided...

8030
05:31:37,810 --> 05:31:39,020
The first batch of postcards...

8031
05:31:39,870 --> 05:31:41,310
Of course they got sent.

8032
05:31:41,450 --> 05:31:42,190
And they were like...

8033
05:31:42,190 --> 05:31:44,750
Had this horrible mark on it.

8034
05:31:44,850 --> 05:31:45,230
This...

8035
05:31:45,890 --> 05:31:47,210
Scuff mark on it.

8036
05:31:47,270 --> 05:31:49,050
So we decided that we wanted to...

8037
05:31:49,050 --> 05:31:50,610
Reprint them and re...

8038
05:31:50,610 --> 05:31:51,030
Or...

8039
05:31:51,030 --> 05:31:51,850
Resend them out.

8040
05:31:52,030 --> 05:31:52,450
So...

8041
05:31:52,450 --> 05:31:55,210
So that's why it ended up being...

8042
05:31:55,210 --> 05:31:56,510
Another like...

8043
05:31:56,510 --> 05:31:57,610
A thousand of...

8044
05:31:57,610 --> 05:31:58,710
Of them.

8045
05:32:03,580 --> 05:32:04,840
Too scared to say...

8046
05:32:04,840 --> 05:32:05,600
Skin marks.

8047
05:32:05,760 --> 05:32:06,080
Aye!

8048
05:32:06,100 --> 05:32:06,400
Aye!

8049
05:32:06,580 --> 05:32:06,840
Aye!

8050
05:32:06,960 --> 05:32:07,200
Aye!

8051
05:32:07,200 --> 05:32:07,320
Aye!

8052
05:32:07,500 --> 05:32:07,640
Aye!

8053
05:32:07,640 --> 05:32:07,720
Yeah.

8054
05:32:08,560 --> 05:32:09,020
Okay.

8055
05:32:09,200 --> 05:32:10,000
Are we ready?

8056
05:32:14,650 --> 05:32:15,110
Okay.

8057
05:32:15,570 --> 05:32:16,410
L1 block.

8058
05:32:17,910 --> 05:32:18,830
R...

8059
05:32:18,830 --> 05:32:20,530
R3...

8060
05:32:20,530 --> 05:32:22,010
Stabby stab.

8061
05:32:22,490 --> 05:32:23,410
Circle...

8062
05:32:23,970 --> 05:32:24,910
Circle stab.

8063
05:32:25,890 --> 05:32:27,050
Left left.

8064
05:32:27,670 --> 05:32:28,390
Left right.

8065
05:32:28,630 --> 05:32:29,690
Sideway stab.

8066
05:32:30,030 --> 05:32:30,850
Up down.

8067
05:32:31,010 --> 05:32:31,710
Uppy stab.

8068
05:32:32,030 --> 05:32:32,550
Okay.

8069
05:32:33,790 --> 05:32:34,250
Colonel!

8070
05:32:41,760 --> 05:32:45,480
Training will have to be postponed if we are invaded by UFOs.

8071
05:32:47,240 --> 05:32:48,340
He's still freaky.

8072
05:32:49,060 --> 05:32:51,220
What if we call Otacon and now we have his thing?

8073
05:32:53,200 --> 05:32:55,320
There's a door at the north end of that corridor.

8074
05:32:55,520 --> 05:32:55,780
Okay.

8075
05:32:56,020 --> 05:32:57,820
Solidus should be somewhere on the other side.

8076
05:32:57,960 --> 05:32:58,200
Okay.

8077
05:32:58,260 --> 05:33:00,220
Stay with Snake and keep north.

8078
05:33:00,320 --> 05:33:00,580
Okay.

8079
05:33:01,800 --> 05:33:02,520
Alright, Snake.

8080
05:33:03,180 --> 05:33:04,100
Are you here, Snake?

8081
05:33:07,080 --> 05:33:08,740
This guy and his UFOs.

8082
05:33:08,740 --> 05:33:09,780
There's a door at the north end of this corridor.

8083
05:33:09,780 --> 05:33:10,360
Yeah.

8084
05:33:10,360 --> 05:33:11,600
The enemy is on the other side.

8085
05:33:11,840 --> 05:33:12,600
We'll rush it.

8086
05:33:12,640 --> 05:33:13,320
We'll rush it.

8087
05:33:13,400 --> 05:33:13,780
Okay.

8088
05:33:14,200 --> 05:33:14,980
Here we go.

8089
05:33:16,340 --> 05:33:16,840
Block.

8090
05:33:18,300 --> 05:33:18,980
I'm blocked.

8091
05:33:19,160 --> 05:33:19,480
Oh, wait.

8092
05:33:19,520 --> 05:33:20,180
My gun.

8093
05:33:20,200 --> 05:33:20,660
Not gun.

8094
05:33:20,980 --> 05:33:22,540
We're blade time.

8095
05:33:22,680 --> 05:33:23,360
Blade mode.

8096
05:33:24,020 --> 05:33:24,820
Blade mode.

8097
05:33:25,060 --> 05:33:25,820
Blade mode.

8098
05:33:26,540 --> 05:33:27,540
Oh, shoot.

8099
05:33:30,940 --> 05:33:31,440
Stop.

8100
05:33:32,860 --> 05:33:33,600
Oh, sorry.

8101
05:33:33,740 --> 05:33:34,400
Oh my gosh.

8102
05:33:34,500 --> 05:33:34,800
Wait.

8103
05:33:34,860 --> 05:33:35,840
My Russians.

8104
05:33:35,980 --> 05:33:36,380
Oh my gosh.

8105
05:33:37,540 --> 05:33:38,040
Hi.

8106
05:33:40,260 --> 05:33:40,760
Thanks, Snake.

8107
05:33:44,020 --> 05:33:44,340
Run

8108
05:33:56,370 --> 05:33:56,990
like this then?

8109
05:33:57,090 --> 05:33:57,270
Okay.

8110
05:33:57,350 --> 05:33:58,330
So I do have to run like that.

8111
05:33:58,510 --> 05:33:59,710
I thought it was just running normal.

8112
05:33:59,870 --> 05:34:00,130
Okay.

8113
05:34:02,370 --> 05:34:03,830
Yeah, I'm okay.

8114
05:34:06,350 --> 05:34:06,870
I'm okay.

8115
05:34:06,950 --> 05:34:07,130
I'm okay.

8116
05:34:16,900 --> 05:34:17,560
Oh my God.

8117
05:34:17,620 --> 05:34:18,060
All the blood.

8118
05:34:31,390 --> 05:34:32,010
Oh, Snake.

8119
05:34:32,150 --> 05:34:32,630
Watch out.

8120
05:34:32,710 --> 05:34:33,270
Watch out, Snake.

8121
05:34:34,890 --> 05:34:35,390
Oh my God.

8122
05:34:36,390 --> 05:34:36,870
I'm going.

8123
05:34:36,970 --> 05:34:37,310
I'm going.

8124
05:34:37,750 --> 05:34:38,370
I got this.

8125
05:34:40,250 --> 05:34:40,890
This is the end.

8126
05:34:40,890 --> 05:34:41,770
Is there any more...

8127
05:34:42,350 --> 05:34:42,710
Oh.

8128
05:34:45,690 --> 05:34:46,450
Good job, Snake.

8129
05:34:48,170 --> 05:34:50,210
I'm just going to regain my life real quick.

8130
05:34:50,430 --> 05:34:51,030
Are you okay, Snake?

8131
05:34:51,150 --> 05:34:51,330
Okay.

8132
05:34:51,410 --> 05:34:51,930
I'm coming.

8133
05:34:52,670 --> 05:34:53,370
I'm coming, Snake.

8134
05:34:54,710 --> 05:34:55,470
I'm coming, Snake.

8135
05:34:56,650 --> 05:34:57,370
I'm coming, Snake.

8136
05:34:58,090 --> 05:34:59,230
Don't push yourself.

8137
05:35:04,710 --> 05:35:05,070
Stop

8138
05:35:11,910 --> 05:35:12,150
me.

8139
05:35:12,170 --> 05:35:12,510
Stop.

8140
05:35:12,570 --> 05:35:12,690
Stop.

8141
05:35:14,270 --> 05:35:14,630
God.

8142
05:35:14,770 --> 05:35:15,770
This is so...

8143
05:35:16,490 --> 05:35:16,850
Ah.

8144
05:35:17,150 --> 05:35:17,510
Ah.

8145
05:35:17,590 --> 05:35:17,710
Ah.

8146
05:35:19,170 --> 05:35:19,650
Oh.

8147
05:35:19,950 --> 05:35:20,430
Okay.

8148
05:35:20,670 --> 05:35:20,950
Good job.

8149
05:35:29,950 --> 05:35:31,130
There's an invisible wall.

8150
05:35:31,530 --> 05:35:32,050
Is there anything?

8151
05:35:34,210 --> 05:35:34,870
Oh, wait.

8152
05:35:34,950 --> 05:35:36,010
We can see them here.

8153
05:35:39,650 --> 05:35:40,610
Metal gear.

8154
05:35:40,690 --> 05:35:41,350
Look at them.

8155
05:35:41,510 --> 05:35:42,810
Look at all the Metal Gear Rays.

8156
05:35:43,950 --> 05:35:45,230
Metal Gear Rays.

8157
05:35:45,230 --> 05:35:46,210
So much blood.

8158
05:35:46,870 --> 05:35:48,450
It's not my blood though.

8159
05:35:50,090 --> 05:35:51,070
Look at them.

8160
05:35:51,470 --> 05:35:51,630
Ah.

8161
05:35:52,090 --> 05:35:52,990
Little baby.

8162
05:35:53,110 --> 05:35:53,570
Little baby.

8163
05:35:53,610 --> 05:35:54,010
Little baby.

8164
05:35:54,230 --> 05:35:54,530
Oh my God.

8165
05:35:55,070 --> 05:35:57,490
Metal Gear Ray, Metal Gear Ray, Metal Gear Ray.

8166
05:35:58,130 --> 05:35:59,850
All right, let's do it all over again.

8167
05:36:00,210 --> 05:36:05,390
Snake, do you have any rations or... Otacon, you got any more rations?

8168
05:36:06,570 --> 05:36:06,930
Anybody?

8169
05:36:08,290 --> 05:36:09,270
Otacon, do your job.

8170
05:36:12,830 --> 05:36:14,870
There's a door at the north end of that corridor.

8171
05:36:15,190 --> 05:36:15,350
Yeah.

8172
05:36:15,650 --> 05:36:16,450
Solidus should be...

8173
05:36:16,450 --> 05:36:17,770
Okay, I already did that, okay.

8174
05:36:18,010 --> 05:36:20,010
Oh, oh, oh, I didn't mean to call him again, my bad.

8175
05:36:20,010 --> 05:36:22,030
There's a... Okay, there we go.

8176
05:36:22,450 --> 05:36:23,530
Okay.

8177
05:36:26,710 --> 05:36:27,790
Hello?

8178
05:36:28,430 --> 05:36:29,270
Oh.

8179
05:36:30,390 --> 05:36:31,470
Where?

8180
05:36:32,510 --> 05:36:33,330
Here?

8181
05:36:34,190 --> 05:36:45,030
The music's so creepy.

8182
05:36:50,450 --> 05:36:51,330
Huh?

8183
05:37:00,650 --> 05:37:02,730
Check his fingers!

8184
05:37:03,110 --> 05:37:04,670
How many fingers does he have?

8185
05:37:05,850 --> 05:37:07,190
Check his fingers!

8186
05:37:15,210 --> 05:37:17,330
He has eleven.

8187
05:37:20,010 --> 05:37:22,990
He's starting to affect GW, which will explain the Colonel's behavior.

8188
05:37:23,410 --> 05:37:23,550
Wow.

8189
05:37:23,590 --> 05:37:25,110
It was all an illusion?

8190
05:37:25,750 --> 05:37:27,210
Everything I've done so far?

8191
05:37:27,230 --> 05:37:27,870
Oh, Brydon.

8192
05:37:27,990 --> 05:37:30,890
Ryden, Snake, what's happening around here?

8193
05:37:30,970 --> 05:37:31,890
He sounds like he's gonna cry.

8194
05:37:32,410 --> 05:37:32,570
I don't know.

8195
05:37:32,570 --> 05:37:35,310
What I do know is that you're standing right here in front of me.

8196
05:37:35,430 --> 05:37:36,470
Not an illusion.

8197
05:37:36,990 --> 05:37:37,910
Flesh and blood.

8198
05:37:38,110 --> 05:37:39,130
Oh, Brydon.

8199
05:37:39,270 --> 05:37:40,010
It's your call.

8200
05:37:40,270 --> 05:37:41,810
You can drop this if you want.

8201
05:37:42,010 --> 05:37:44,030
No, I can't do that.

8202
05:37:44,470 --> 05:37:45,070
Let's go.

8203
05:37:46,890 --> 05:37:48,410
Be strong, be strong.

8204
05:37:51,990 --> 05:37:54,290
See if the hair blends into his shirt collar.

8205
05:37:54,510 --> 05:37:55,010
Yeah, yeah.

8206
05:37:55,690 --> 05:37:56,750
We're in the colon.

8207
05:37:58,250 --> 05:37:58,770
Hello?

8208
05:37:59,690 --> 05:38:01,370
Brydon, they've got Rose.

8209
05:38:01,790 --> 05:38:02,310
What?

8210
05:38:02,770 --> 05:38:04,810
Rose is being held in the holds.

8211
05:38:04,850 --> 05:38:05,750
It's a trap.

8212
05:38:06,090 --> 05:38:06,430
Help!

8213
05:38:06,730 --> 05:38:07,250
Rose!

8214
05:38:07,530 --> 05:38:09,250
Why are you still believing him?

8215
05:38:09,470 --> 05:38:10,890
But Snake, it's a trap.

8216
05:38:11,150 --> 05:38:14,950
Since the Colonel doesn't exist, there's no way he can take Rose hostage.

8217
05:38:15,170 --> 05:38:16,610
Yeah, you're right.

8218
05:38:16,650 --> 05:38:17,710
I am right.

8219
05:38:18,170 --> 05:38:18,690
Okay.

8220
05:38:18,690 --> 05:38:18,890
Okay.

8221
05:38:19,950 --> 05:38:21,610
Does Rose exist?

8222
05:38:22,010 --> 05:38:23,290
Don't be weird.

8223
05:38:23,470 --> 05:38:24,670
Don't be weird.

8224
05:38:24,770 --> 05:38:26,130
What if I've never really met her?

8225
05:38:26,410 --> 05:38:26,770
What?

8226
05:38:26,890 --> 05:38:32,450
If the Colonel is something that I partly dreamt up, then everything I remember about her could be...

8227
05:38:32,450 --> 05:38:33,790
Don't jump to conclusions.

8228
05:38:34,150 --> 05:38:38,010
Wouldn't it be a crazy twist if Snake and Otacon were the real gaslighters?

8229
05:38:38,650 --> 05:38:41,190
Is this what Olga was talking about?

8230
05:38:44,210 --> 05:38:44,770
Nice.

8231
05:38:51,760 --> 05:38:53,580
Don't watch where you're pointing that thing.

8232
05:38:54,900 --> 05:38:55,500
Here we go.

8233
05:38:58,180 --> 05:38:58,580
Oh.

8234
05:38:59,140 --> 05:38:59,760
Oh, wait.

8235
05:39:00,380 --> 05:39:01,740
I just remembered something.

8236
05:39:03,000 --> 05:39:03,800
Here we go.

8237
05:39:03,980 --> 05:39:04,360
Here we go.

8238
05:39:11,220 --> 05:39:14,660
Dropping like monkeys.

8239
05:39:16,360 --> 05:39:17,380
Maybe I... You know what?

8240
05:39:17,440 --> 05:39:19,680
I'm just gonna... I don't know why I'm using my gun.

8241
05:39:19,880 --> 05:39:20,480
Oh my gosh.

8242
05:39:20,520 --> 05:39:21,620
I saw this in the...

8243
05:39:25,820 --> 05:39:27,860
I'm just gonna use my gun.

8244
05:39:32,440 --> 05:39:32,800
Oh.

8245
05:39:32,800 --> 05:39:34,220
Yeah, I can use it on some of them.

8246
05:39:37,380 --> 05:39:37,740
Anyway,

8247
05:39:41,980 --> 05:39:43,640
so I started blasting.

8248
05:39:45,460 --> 05:39:45,820
Yeah.

8249
05:39:49,920 --> 05:39:50,280
Yeah.

8250
05:39:50,280 --> 05:39:51,040
Take him out.

8251
05:39:51,080 --> 05:39:51,520
Take him out.

8252
05:39:57,000 --> 05:39:57,960
We get him eventually.

8253
05:39:58,180 --> 05:39:58,840
We get him eventually.

8254
05:40:00,180 --> 05:40:00,820
Yeah.

8255
05:40:01,420 --> 05:40:02,780
Out of the way, baby.

8256
05:40:05,760 --> 05:40:07,760
The sword is overrated.

8257
05:40:09,140 --> 05:40:11,160
The sword is overrated, everyone.

8258
05:40:12,100 --> 05:40:13,540
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

8259
05:40:14,700 --> 05:40:15,980
Oh, God.

8260
05:40:16,200 --> 05:40:21,000
Oh my God.

8261
05:40:26,820 --> 05:40:28,540
Fish and mailed.

8262
05:40:28,580 --> 05:40:29,340
Fish and mailed.

8263
05:40:30,520 --> 05:40:31,740
Uh-oh.

8264
05:40:31,860 --> 05:40:32,800
Uh-oh.

8265
05:40:32,800 --> 05:40:33,360
We're almost out.

8266
05:40:35,360 --> 05:40:35,960
Ouchie ouch.

8267
05:40:39,000 --> 05:40:41,840
Time to change to this guy.

8268
05:40:44,360 --> 05:40:45,280
You got him.

8269
05:40:46,000 --> 05:40:46,700
Oh my God.

8270
05:40:49,580 --> 05:40:51,340
I need to heal, but...

8271
05:40:52,120 --> 05:40:52,600
Again?

8272
05:40:54,020 --> 05:40:55,400
You can't do this to me twice.

8273
05:40:55,740 --> 05:40:56,560
Oh my gosh.

8274
05:40:56,780 --> 05:40:57,860
My little bandage.

8275
05:40:57,860 --> 05:40:58,340
I can't see.

8276
05:40:58,780 --> 05:40:59,520
Kojima, please.

8277
05:41:00,960 --> 05:41:02,120
Is that bandage?

8278
05:41:02,120 --> 05:41:02,600
Bandage.

8279
05:41:05,100 --> 05:41:06,680
Oh, I never got a cold.

8280
05:41:08,140 --> 05:41:09,240
Fish and mailed.

8281
05:41:09,300 --> 05:41:10,140
Fish and mailed.

8282
05:41:17,640 --> 05:41:18,040
Yeah.

8283
05:41:18,080 --> 05:41:18,440
That's right.

8284
05:41:19,440 --> 05:41:19,840
Oh.

8285
05:41:19,920 --> 05:41:20,460
That's you, Snake.

8286
05:41:20,660 --> 05:41:21,120
Oh my gosh.

8287
05:41:22,320 --> 05:41:22,720
Dang.

8288
05:41:22,840 --> 05:41:23,580
Snake is so fast.

8289
05:41:43,630 --> 05:41:44,030
Oh.

8290
05:41:44,030 --> 05:41:44,670
Thank you.

8291
05:41:46,210 --> 05:41:47,370
Can you give me a ration?

8292
05:41:50,430 --> 05:41:51,590
Give me health, please.

8293
05:41:51,810 --> 05:41:52,310
Oh my God.

8294
05:41:52,390 --> 05:41:52,730
Ouch.

8295
05:41:54,150 --> 05:41:55,610
What are you giving me?

8296
05:41:55,650 --> 05:41:56,230
More ammo.

8297
05:41:56,730 --> 05:41:57,250
Okay.

8298
05:41:58,830 --> 05:41:59,770
Snake is... Oh.

8299
05:41:59,830 --> 05:42:00,470
I got it.

8300
05:42:01,770 --> 05:42:02,530
Body armor?

8301
05:42:02,790 --> 05:42:03,550
Oh, you're right.

8302
05:42:08,290 --> 05:42:09,490
Just eat the bullets.

8303
05:42:17,610 --> 05:42:18,130
Fortune!

8304
05:42:21,590 --> 05:42:24,030
She's been... She's... She's...

8305
05:42:24,030 --> 05:42:25,950
It's been a long wait, Solid Snake.

8306
05:42:25,950 --> 05:42:27,030
She's seen better days.

8307
05:42:28,770 --> 05:42:29,370
What?

8308
05:42:29,690 --> 05:42:32,230
Two years ago, you killed my father.

8309
05:42:32,430 --> 05:42:34,830
That was the beginning of hell for us.

8310
05:42:35,190 --> 05:42:38,750
Everyone I love has been taken from me one by one.

8311
05:42:38,930 --> 05:42:41,770
And no matter how hard I try, I can't follow them.

8312
05:42:41,910 --> 05:42:43,330
An endless nightmare.

8313
05:42:43,870 --> 05:42:47,190
The only thing we live for is to see it end.

8314
05:42:48,830 --> 05:42:51,350
Our wait is almost over.

8315
05:42:51,810 --> 05:42:54,650
You can't be serious about firing the nuke.

8316
05:42:54,650 --> 05:43:00,090
Since no one can kill me, I may as well kill everyone I can.

8317
05:43:00,410 --> 05:43:00,770
Damn.

8318
05:43:01,770 --> 05:43:02,870
I'm starting.

8319
05:43:03,170 --> 05:43:04,270
You suck.

8320
05:43:04,790 --> 05:43:07,550
Looks like I'm today's pick.

8321
05:43:07,770 --> 05:43:08,590
You go on ahead.

8322
05:43:09,070 --> 05:43:09,590
Wait!

8323
05:43:10,170 --> 05:43:11,630
Isn't two better than one?

8324
05:43:13,290 --> 05:43:14,510
Ow, the edge.

8325
05:43:15,170 --> 05:43:15,810
Snake!

8326
05:43:15,890 --> 05:43:16,390
No!

8327
05:43:16,550 --> 05:43:16,970
Snake!

8328
05:43:17,430 --> 05:43:18,530
You want eternal rest?

8329
05:43:18,710 --> 05:43:19,830
I've got it right here.

8330
05:43:20,170 --> 05:43:21,610
I've got it right here.

8331
05:43:21,690 --> 05:43:23,690
Say hello to my eternal rest.

8332
05:43:25,710 --> 05:43:27,270
What are you gonna do?

8333
05:43:27,550 --> 05:43:29,050
Bullets can't get near her.

8334
05:43:29,230 --> 05:43:30,110
I'll think of something.

8335
05:43:30,250 --> 05:43:31,790
There's no such thing as a witch.

8336
05:43:32,050 --> 05:43:33,850
You think you can kill me?

8337
05:43:35,550 --> 05:43:37,090
She's been... why are you even crying?

8338
05:43:37,470 --> 05:43:38,130
I don't know what your group's been through.

8339
05:43:38,310 --> 05:43:39,970
But let's get one thing clear.

8340
05:43:40,410 --> 05:43:41,930
I didn't kill your father.

8341
05:43:43,690 --> 05:43:46,270
Do you think anyone believes your lies?

8342
05:43:47,110 --> 05:43:47,530
Raiden!

8343
05:43:47,650 --> 05:43:48,410
Get out of here!

8344
05:43:48,690 --> 05:43:50,850
Why don't you tell her who it was?

8345
05:43:50,850 --> 05:43:52,150
You literally saw it.

8346
05:43:57,740 --> 05:43:58,620
Oh my god.

8347
05:43:58,720 --> 05:43:59,660
Snake, don't die.

8348
05:43:59,980 --> 05:44:00,920
What a thrill.

8349
05:44:05,220 --> 05:44:07,160
I'm going to go fight the hot girl alone.

8350
05:44:07,420 --> 05:44:07,920
Now go!

8351
05:44:09,720 --> 05:44:11,180
Here we are, everybody.

8352
05:44:15,260 --> 05:44:17,060
Arsenal Gear Rectum.

8353
05:44:23,620 --> 05:44:25,680
Jack, I've been watching how you fight.

8354
05:44:27,060 --> 05:44:28,520
It says it on the floor!

8355
05:44:28,520 --> 05:44:32,000
It looks like you've remembered the way you used to kill the angels.

8356
05:44:32,000 --> 05:44:33,040
That's what it's really called!

8357
05:44:34,680 --> 05:44:37,900
Or is it one of the S3 plan's proud achievements?

8358
05:44:38,420 --> 05:44:39,660
What are you talking about?

8359
05:44:40,940 --> 05:44:42,540
What are you talking about?

8360
05:44:43,540 --> 05:44:48,720
It came as a complete surprise when Ocelot discovered the S3 data from GW.

8361
05:44:49,780 --> 05:44:51,520
Not a bad idea, though.

8362
05:44:52,520 --> 05:44:54,420
Using fire to fight fire.

8363
05:44:54,740 --> 05:44:56,940
Creating the perfect assassin to retire.

8364
05:44:56,940 --> 05:44:58,960
Solid Snake's brother.

8365
05:45:00,880 --> 05:45:04,940
S3 stands for Solid Snake Simulation.

8366
05:45:05,440 --> 05:45:10,160
It's a development program to artificially reproduce Solid Snake.

8367
05:45:10,280 --> 05:45:11,440
The perfect warrior.

8368
05:45:12,240 --> 05:45:15,160
The result is a Foxhound commando.

8369
05:45:15,200 --> 05:45:21,080
When Foxhound no longer exists, a simulated Solid Snake shaped by VR regimen.

8370
05:45:21,220 --> 05:45:23,780
Sound like someone you know, Jack?

8371
05:45:23,920 --> 05:45:24,400
No, Gear Rectum.

8372
05:45:25,240 --> 05:45:29,020
I'm sorry to see you reduced to one of the Patriots' puppets.

8373
05:45:29,860 --> 05:45:31,680
But I've made use of you.

8374
05:45:31,820 --> 05:45:33,460
And their plan, too.

8375
05:45:34,960 --> 05:45:36,760
Solid Snake's sudden appearance.

8376
05:45:37,020 --> 05:45:37,920
Your arrival.

8377
05:45:38,240 --> 05:45:41,160
It was obvious the Patriots were among my ranks.

8378
05:45:41,780 --> 05:45:45,440
I had to smoke out the agent before the mission entered the final phase.

8379
05:45:45,820 --> 05:45:47,200
You came in handy.

8380
05:45:47,200 --> 05:45:48,280
Sorry, I doubt you.

8381
05:45:48,400 --> 05:45:48,560
As bait.

8382
05:45:51,120 --> 05:45:51,680
Jack.

8383
05:45:52,000 --> 05:45:52,560
Yeah?

8384
05:45:52,560 --> 05:45:55,280
Those days during the Civil War were as real as they come.

8385
05:45:56,340 --> 05:45:57,840
Every day was absolute.

8386
05:45:58,480 --> 05:46:00,580
Split between life and death.

8387
05:46:00,880 --> 05:46:01,280
Yeah.

8388
05:46:01,660 --> 05:46:03,080
You ran from it.

8389
05:46:03,240 --> 05:46:07,720
And now you've been led back to war by something less than real.

8390
05:46:08,020 --> 05:46:09,240
Look at the way he rides.

8391
05:46:12,340 --> 05:46:12,660
Sorry.

8392
05:46:16,580 --> 05:46:17,220
Solidus!

8393
05:46:20,680 --> 05:46:22,160
No more games, Jack.

8394
05:46:22,560 --> 05:46:23,720
At least you know.

8395
05:46:24,560 --> 05:46:27,100
There's no reason to keep you alive now.

8396
05:46:27,400 --> 05:46:27,520
No!

8397
05:46:28,920 --> 05:46:29,480
Papa!

8398
05:46:31,660 --> 05:46:32,500
Please, Papa!

8399
05:46:35,220 --> 05:46:37,680
I've given you a worthy opponent, at least.

8400
05:46:38,200 --> 05:46:43,160
But now, you should die as the little Jacky-boy I once knew.

8401
05:46:43,160 --> 05:46:43,800
Jacky-boy.

8402
05:46:46,640 --> 05:46:47,760
Come on.

8403
05:46:47,780 --> 05:46:48,560
Come on, Raiden.

8404
05:46:48,600 --> 05:46:50,460
You have so many other better weapons.

8405
05:47:01,310 --> 05:47:02,270
Oh shit.

8406
05:47:02,350 --> 05:47:03,030
Oh shit.

8407
05:47:03,130 --> 05:47:03,350
Okay.

8408
05:47:04,090 --> 05:47:05,070
Um, hold on.

8409
05:47:05,270 --> 05:47:06,430
I'm gonna use this ration.

8410
05:47:07,310 --> 05:47:08,190
Body armor.

8411
05:47:08,900 --> 05:47:09,830
What is BDU?

8412
05:47:09,890 --> 05:47:10,910
Oh, that's the uniform.

8413
05:47:11,810 --> 05:47:12,910
That's the Gerlukovich.

8414
05:47:13,070 --> 05:47:13,250
Okay.

8415
05:47:13,370 --> 05:47:16,250
Then, we're gonna grab a...

8416
05:47:18,330 --> 05:47:19,250
Stinger Missile!

8417
05:47:20,110 --> 05:47:21,570
And we're gonna...

8418
05:47:22,060 --> 05:47:23,730
Okay, remember how to do this fight.

8419
05:47:24,430 --> 05:47:25,010
Ouch!

8420
05:47:26,410 --> 05:47:28,410
Remember how to do this fight.

8421
05:47:28,410 --> 05:47:28,910
Right.

8422
05:47:35,760 --> 05:47:36,500
Okay, I remember.

8423
05:47:40,760 --> 05:47:42,120
We'll just focus on this guy real quick.

8424
05:47:45,680 --> 05:47:47,600
No, I need to get him before...

8425
05:47:50,400 --> 05:47:51,700
Oh shoot, I missed my chance.

8426
05:47:51,860 --> 05:47:52,220
Oh shoot.

8427
05:47:53,880 --> 05:47:54,200
Ouch!

8428
05:47:54,660 --> 05:47:55,120
Ouchie ouch.

8429
05:47:55,860 --> 05:47:56,360
Get up.

8430
05:47:56,380 --> 05:47:57,300
Get up, Raiden, please.

8431
05:47:57,540 --> 05:47:59,200
Oh my gosh, I keep missing my chances.

8432
05:48:01,600 --> 05:48:04,320
I know I have to hit him in the mouth, but I have to hit him.

8433
05:48:04,320 --> 05:48:06,320
Can I chaff in this part?

8434
05:48:06,500 --> 05:48:07,400
Does chaffing work?

8435
05:48:12,050 --> 05:48:12,810
Can't remember.

8436
05:48:24,300 --> 05:48:25,080
Oh shit.

8437
05:48:25,220 --> 05:48:26,280
Oh, I don't think I hit him.

8438
05:48:27,480 --> 05:48:28,000
No!

8439
05:48:32,560 --> 05:48:33,780
Oh my god.

8440
05:48:34,500 --> 05:48:35,400
It does help.

8441
05:48:44,730 --> 05:48:45,390
There we go.

8442
05:48:46,690 --> 05:48:47,210
Woohoo!

8443
05:48:48,410 --> 05:48:49,450
Holy moly.

8444
05:48:50,230 --> 05:48:51,310
Can't get too close.

8445
05:48:58,000 --> 05:49:01,700
Stop sending missiles at me.

8446
05:49:15,500 --> 05:49:16,000
There we go.

8447
05:49:16,100 --> 05:49:16,520
Nice.

8448
05:49:18,380 --> 05:49:19,060
So...

8449
05:49:19,060 --> 05:49:21,400
I don't

8450
05:49:37,460 --> 05:49:38,300
remember this part.

8451
05:49:38,620 --> 05:49:40,180
Wait, I don't remember this phase!

8452
05:49:43,440 --> 05:49:45,440
I don't remember this phase!

8453
05:49:45,520 --> 05:49:46,560
Oh shoot!

8454
05:49:46,760 --> 05:49:47,360
I don't...

8455
05:49:47,360 --> 05:49:49,000
Hold on.

8456
05:49:51,820 --> 05:49:51,900
I made a mistake.

8457
05:49:52,200 --> 05:49:52,720
Oh wait.

8458
05:49:52,780 --> 05:49:53,700
No, I should have gone to Otacon.

8459
05:49:54,280 --> 05:49:54,740
Otacon.

8460
05:49:54,760 --> 05:49:55,100
Oh, sorry.

8461
05:49:55,240 --> 05:49:55,480
Otacon.

8462
05:49:55,680 --> 05:49:56,680
Otacon, help me.

8463
05:49:59,880 --> 05:50:02,920
Raiden, aim for Ray's head section with the stinger missiles.

8464
05:50:07,460 --> 05:50:08,020
That's it?

8465
05:50:10,300 --> 05:50:11,600
Call the colonel.

8466
05:50:11,840 --> 05:50:12,400
Colonel!

8467
05:50:13,240 --> 05:50:13,800
The

8468
05:50:27,840 --> 05:50:30,100
mass production Metal Gear is unmanned.

8469
05:50:30,320 --> 05:50:34,060
It's probably under the control of GW, the Arsenal Gear AI.

8470
05:50:34,660 --> 05:50:37,180
A chaff attack should cause electronic interference.

8471
05:50:38,260 --> 05:50:39,360
Confuse Ray for a moment.

8472
05:50:39,400 --> 05:50:39,700
Okay.

8473
05:50:39,840 --> 05:50:42,220
Use the opportunity to fire a stinger into him.

8474
05:50:42,300 --> 05:50:42,780
Yeah yeah yeah.

8475
05:50:42,960 --> 05:50:43,320
Okay.

8476
05:50:45,160 --> 05:50:47,040
Hoi yui hoi yui.

8477
05:50:47,240 --> 05:50:48,820
Hoi yui hoi yui.

8478
05:50:48,940 --> 05:50:49,260
Hoi yui hoi yui.

8479
05:50:49,480 --> 05:50:49,500
Hoi yui hoi yui.

8480
05:50:49,640 --> 05:50:50,080
Aaaaah!

8481
05:51:00,880 --> 05:51:01,760
I had...

8482
05:51:01,760 --> 05:51:05,520
I'm so mad because I had the...

8483
05:51:08,720 --> 05:51:10,540
Guys, I don't think this is the run.

8484
05:51:10,660 --> 05:51:11,360
I'm just saying.

8485
05:51:12,420 --> 05:51:13,920
I don't think this is the run.

8486
05:51:13,960 --> 05:51:14,400
Byeee.

8487
05:51:14,540 --> 05:51:14,620
Bye.

8488
05:51:19,450 --> 05:51:20,850
Yeah, he's leaving!

8489
05:51:22,430 --> 05:51:23,590
That's so unfair.

8490
05:51:24,350 --> 05:51:26,150
That's so unfair, man.

8491
05:51:27,050 --> 05:51:28,130
Oh gosh.

8492
05:51:29,630 --> 05:51:31,050
Oh my god, please!

8493
05:51:31,110 --> 05:51:32,070
I just stood up!

8494
05:51:32,450 --> 05:51:33,670
This is so unfair!

8495
05:51:38,480 --> 05:51:40,220
You son of a bitch!

8496
05:51:45,720 --> 05:51:49,180
That was so mean!

8497
05:51:49,180 --> 05:51:50,360
I just stood up!

8498
05:51:51,060 --> 05:51:53,780
Where was my iframes?

8499
05:51:59,740 --> 05:52:00,800
Fishing my own.

8500
05:52:01,380 --> 05:52:02,220
If only.

8501
05:52:04,080 --> 05:52:04,700
Alright.

8502
05:52:07,560 --> 05:52:08,180
Chalk.

8503
05:52:11,100 --> 05:52:11,720
Ration.

8504
05:52:11,840 --> 05:52:12,340
Body armor.

8505
05:52:13,400 --> 05:52:13,880
Chalk.

8506
05:52:13,880 --> 05:52:15,560
Oh, that's a magazine!

8507
05:52:15,780 --> 05:52:16,360
Oh my god.

8508
05:52:16,420 --> 05:52:17,020
Oh my god.

8509
05:52:17,040 --> 05:52:17,380
Oh my god.

8510
05:52:20,800 --> 05:52:22,220
What the... Oh my god.

8511
05:52:22,260 --> 05:52:22,980
What are you doing?

8512
05:52:24,680 --> 05:52:26,400
That was really embarrassing.

8513
05:52:26,580 --> 05:52:26,740
Okay.

8514
05:52:27,880 --> 05:52:28,360
I

8515
05:52:44,800 --> 05:52:46,800
think the chaffs last a little longer.

8516
05:52:48,620 --> 05:52:49,360
Oh, okay.

8517
05:52:49,500 --> 05:52:49,900
Oh shoot.

8518
05:52:50,000 --> 05:52:50,760
I just realized.

8519
05:52:51,840 --> 05:52:53,060
I did not...

8520
05:53:10,220 --> 05:53:12,460
I didn't... I didn't... I didn't...

8521
05:53:12,460 --> 05:53:12,780
Oh!

8522
05:53:12,920 --> 05:53:14,180
It still works!

8523
05:53:14,980 --> 05:53:15,520
Yeah!

8524
05:53:15,620 --> 05:53:16,100
Let's go!

8525
05:53:17,240 --> 05:53:17,640
Nice!

8526
05:53:22,200 --> 05:53:23,000
Will

8527
05:53:28,500 --> 05:53:29,460
it work?

8528
05:53:29,660 --> 05:53:30,240
Nice!

8529
05:53:32,840 --> 05:53:34,440
Okay, bye!

8530
05:53:47,930 --> 05:53:48,850
So unfair!

8531
05:53:49,790 --> 05:53:51,810
I have no more bandages either.

8532
05:53:52,110 --> 05:53:52,770
Oh gosh.

8533
05:53:55,170 --> 05:53:57,950
This thing is such a pain in the butt.

8534
05:53:58,510 --> 05:53:59,670
Oh my god.

8535
05:54:02,270 --> 05:54:03,670
I need the chaff again.

8536
05:54:04,830 --> 05:54:05,410
Whoa!

8537
05:54:05,770 --> 05:54:06,350
Whoa!

8538
05:54:06,550 --> 05:54:07,410
My vision!

8539
05:54:09,430 --> 05:54:10,010
Chaff!

8540
05:54:16,740 --> 05:54:17,320
Okay.

8541
05:54:17,320 --> 05:54:19,560
Now is the time to strengthen myself.

8542
05:54:23,080 --> 05:54:23,660
Eeeeee!

8543
05:54:45,160 --> 05:54:45,860
Hold on.

8544
05:54:45,940 --> 05:54:46,920
I think I need to get that.

8545
05:54:48,180 --> 05:54:48,620
Oh!

8546
05:54:49,160 --> 05:54:50,020
Oh gosh.

8547
05:54:50,200 --> 05:54:50,340
Okay.

8548
05:54:51,820 --> 05:54:52,520
Chaff again.

8549
05:54:54,220 --> 05:54:54,660
Chaff!

8550
05:55:05,960 --> 05:55:06,840
Those are stupid.

8551
05:55:07,040 --> 05:55:07,320
Silly.

8552
05:55:08,100 --> 05:55:09,220
And... take him out!

8553
05:55:10,760 --> 05:55:11,200
Nice!

8554
05:55:11,600 --> 05:55:12,040
Okay.

8555
05:55:12,840 --> 05:55:13,900
I'm gonna grab this.

8556
05:55:14,480 --> 05:55:15,120
Thank you.

8557
05:55:15,340 --> 05:55:15,920
Bye bye.

8558
05:55:16,160 --> 05:55:16,800
Bye bye.

8559
05:55:16,840 --> 05:55:17,180
Bye bye.

8560
05:55:17,180 --> 05:55:17,680
Bye bye.

8561
05:55:18,160 --> 05:55:18,900
Bye bye.

8562
05:55:18,900 --> 05:55:19,300
Bye bye.

8563
05:55:19,480 --> 05:55:19,740
Bye bye.

8564
05:55:20,380 --> 05:55:20,820
Next!

8565
05:55:21,080 --> 05:55:21,580
Next please!

8566
05:55:23,540 --> 05:55:23,980
Oh!

8567
05:55:26,110 --> 05:55:26,750
Oh my god.

8568
05:55:26,870 --> 05:55:27,090
No!

8569
05:55:27,250 --> 05:55:27,490
No!

8570
05:55:27,570 --> 05:55:28,210
That might waste!

8571
05:55:31,660 --> 05:55:32,980
You're such a jerk!

8572
05:55:33,240 --> 05:55:33,460
Oh!

8573
05:55:33,540 --> 05:55:35,080
I don't think that worked.

8574
05:55:35,300 --> 05:55:35,640
Oh!

8575
05:55:35,640 --> 05:55:35,800
It did!

8576
05:55:35,900 --> 05:55:36,300
It did!

8577
05:55:36,380 --> 05:55:36,500
It did!

8578
05:55:36,620 --> 05:55:36,960
Nice!

8579
05:55:37,260 --> 05:55:37,680
Okay.

8580
05:55:38,260 --> 05:55:39,220
And chaff.

8581
05:55:48,200 --> 05:55:48,620
Okay.

8582
05:55:49,140 --> 05:55:49,660
Sting up!

8583
05:55:51,300 --> 05:55:51,820
Sting up!

8584
05:56:04,610 --> 05:56:05,030
Oh!

8585
05:56:05,110 --> 05:56:05,810
I think I missed.

8586
05:56:05,950 --> 05:56:06,090
Oh!

8587
05:56:06,110 --> 05:56:06,470
Never mind.

8588
05:56:13,640 --> 05:56:14,060
Chaff!

8589
05:56:14,360 --> 05:56:14,780
Soon!

8590
05:56:15,120 --> 05:56:15,960
Soonish chaff.

8591
05:56:16,000 --> 05:56:16,120
Oh!

8592
05:56:16,140 --> 05:56:16,580
Chaff now.

8593
05:56:17,560 --> 05:56:20,160
I think I can get like two in while...

8594
05:56:23,480 --> 05:56:23,840
Okay.

8595
05:56:23,840 --> 05:56:24,200
Okay.

8596
05:56:24,260 --> 05:56:24,840
There we go.

8597
05:56:25,340 --> 05:56:25,840
Sting up!

8598
05:56:36,020 --> 05:56:36,600
You're close.

8599
05:56:36,680 --> 05:56:37,180
You're really close.

8600
05:56:38,040 --> 05:56:38,760
Run away.

8601
05:56:38,920 --> 05:56:39,120
Run away.

8602
05:56:39,220 --> 05:56:39,440
Run away.

8603
05:56:40,300 --> 05:56:41,000
You're too close.

8604
05:56:41,080 --> 05:56:41,480
You're too close.

8605
05:56:53,030 --> 05:56:53,390
Oh!

8606
05:56:53,390 --> 05:56:53,970
So unfair.

8607
05:56:54,190 --> 05:56:54,770
So unfair.

8608
05:56:55,310 --> 05:56:57,010
How am I supposed to know which one comes out?

8609
05:56:59,030 --> 05:56:59,390
Beep!

8610
05:56:59,390 --> 05:56:59,750
Beep!

8611
05:56:59,910 --> 05:57:00,270
Beep!

8612
05:57:00,290 --> 05:57:00,650
Beep!

8613
05:57:25,780 --> 05:57:26,140
Oh!

8614
05:57:26,280 --> 05:57:26,640
Shit!

8615
05:57:26,740 --> 05:57:26,800
Shit!

8616
05:57:26,920 --> 05:57:27,000
Shit!

8617
05:57:27,000 --> 05:57:27,120
Shit!

8618
05:57:27,180 --> 05:57:27,180
Shit!

8619
05:57:27,260 --> 05:57:28,400
There we go.

8620
05:57:30,320 --> 05:57:31,600
Not the great timing.

8621
05:57:31,640 --> 05:57:32,560
Not the best timing.

8622
05:57:32,640 --> 05:57:33,120
But you know.

8623
05:57:33,120 --> 05:57:33,900
Oh!

8624
05:57:34,300 --> 05:57:35,500
That's the wrong guy.

8625
05:57:36,900 --> 05:57:41,990
Can you give me more chaffs?

8626
05:57:42,570 --> 05:57:43,270
Oh!

8627
05:57:43,270 --> 05:57:43,670
Shit!

8628
05:57:43,850 --> 05:57:44,030
Oh!

8629
05:57:44,600 --> 05:57:45,190
Nice dodge.

8630
05:57:45,490 --> 05:57:46,490
Nice dodge.

8631
05:57:46,630 --> 05:57:47,210
Nice dodge!

8632
05:57:49,030 --> 05:57:49,730
Okay.

8633
05:57:49,730 --> 05:57:50,430
Okay.

8634
05:57:50,610 --> 05:57:50,770
Okay.

8635
05:57:51,550 --> 05:57:53,430
Right where it hurts.

8636
05:57:53,690 --> 05:57:55,530
And right in the kisser.

8637
05:57:56,810 --> 05:57:57,510
Nice!

8638
05:57:58,460 --> 05:57:58,810
Nice!

8639
05:58:01,410 --> 05:58:02,110
Oh!

8640
05:58:02,110 --> 05:58:03,910
He's like immune for a second.

8641
05:58:05,190 --> 05:58:05,610
Oh!

8642
05:58:05,610 --> 05:58:06,030
Okay.

8643
05:58:06,190 --> 05:58:06,930
I think he's better.

8644
05:58:07,110 --> 05:58:07,750
There we go.

8645
05:58:09,290 --> 05:58:09,710
Okay.

8646
05:58:09,990 --> 05:58:11,430
Right in the kisser!

8647
05:58:12,490 --> 05:58:12,910
Oh!

8648
05:58:13,350 --> 05:58:13,770
Gosh!

8649
05:58:14,690 --> 05:58:16,490
Once I'm out of chaffs, what do I do?

8650
05:58:17,090 --> 05:58:17,510
Oh!

8651
05:58:17,550 --> 05:58:17,910
Whoops!

8652
05:58:17,970 --> 05:58:18,950
I didn't mean to hit that guy.

8653
05:58:19,730 --> 05:58:20,150
Oh!

8654
05:58:20,170 --> 05:58:20,450
Shoot!

8655
05:58:21,870 --> 05:58:22,290
Run!

8656
05:58:22,290 --> 05:58:22,950
Nice hit.

8657
05:58:23,390 --> 05:58:23,810
And...

8658
05:58:24,670 --> 05:58:25,230
Kiss him!

8659
05:58:26,870 --> 05:58:27,290
Oh!

8660
05:58:27,310 --> 05:58:27,690
Chaffs!

8661
05:58:27,690 --> 05:58:27,870
Chaffs!

8662
05:58:27,870 --> 05:58:28,090
Chaffs!

8663
05:58:28,090 --> 05:58:28,410
Chaffs!

8664
05:58:28,490 --> 05:58:30,790
Once I'm out of chaffs, what do I do?

8665
05:58:35,630 --> 05:58:36,030
Wait!

8666
05:58:36,150 --> 05:58:36,310
Oh!

8667
05:58:36,390 --> 05:58:36,910
He's not done.

8668
05:58:37,010 --> 05:58:37,530
Oh my god!

8669
05:58:37,570 --> 05:58:39,770
I came running in thinking he was still over.

8670
05:58:40,330 --> 05:58:41,310
Oh my gosh!

8671
05:58:41,630 --> 05:58:42,230
That's so...

8672
05:58:48,460 --> 05:58:49,260
Right there!

8673
05:58:51,580 --> 05:58:52,400
Now he's done.

8674
05:58:57,640 --> 05:58:59,400
Once I'm out of chaffs, what do I do?

8675
05:59:01,860 --> 05:59:02,260
Ouchie!

8676
05:59:02,260 --> 05:59:02,500
Ouchie!

8677
05:59:02,500 --> 05:59:02,660
Okay.

8678
05:59:03,100 --> 05:59:04,180
That's nice, I guess.

8679
05:59:07,100 --> 05:59:07,800
Body armor.

8680
05:59:09,560 --> 05:59:10,220
Oh gosh!

8681
05:59:10,340 --> 05:59:10,580
Oh gosh!

8682
05:59:10,620 --> 05:59:10,860
Oh gosh!

8683
05:59:10,960 --> 05:59:11,120
Oh gosh!

8684
05:59:11,160 --> 05:59:11,700
Oh shit!

8685
05:59:15,760 --> 05:59:18,840
I was trying to... I pressed X.

8686
05:59:18,940 --> 05:59:19,720
I swear I did.

8687
05:59:20,320 --> 05:59:21,160
Oh gosh!

8688
05:59:21,320 --> 05:59:21,480
Okay.

8689
05:59:21,900 --> 05:59:22,980
Two more chaffs.

8690
05:59:24,640 --> 05:59:25,060
Oh!

8691
05:59:39,650 --> 05:59:40,290
There we go.

8692
05:59:44,360 --> 05:59:45,200
Stinger missile...

8693
05:59:46,100 --> 05:59:46,520
Okay.

8694
05:59:46,660 --> 05:59:47,240
I have a lot.

8695
05:59:47,400 --> 05:59:47,760
Okay.

8696
05:59:50,480 --> 05:59:50,900
Okay.

8697
05:59:50,960 --> 05:59:51,120
Okay.

8698
05:59:53,600 --> 05:59:55,300
Ray... Did I say Rose on accident?

8699
05:59:55,380 --> 05:59:55,720
My bad.

8700
05:59:56,860 --> 05:59:57,300
Okay.

8701
05:59:58,500 --> 05:59:59,100
Get him.

8702
05:59:59,160 --> 05:59:59,520
Get him.

8703
05:59:59,560 --> 05:59:59,760
Get him.

8704
06:00:02,720 --> 06:00:03,740
Oh gosh though.

8705
06:00:03,800 --> 06:00:04,340
For real.

8706
06:00:04,360 --> 06:00:06,500
Once I'm out of chaffs, what do I do?

8707
06:00:07,520 --> 06:00:09,300
This has been my whole thing!

8708
06:00:11,480 --> 06:00:13,100
This has been my whole thing!

8709
06:00:15,720 --> 06:00:16,800
I'm so bound!

8710
06:00:18,640 --> 06:00:19,080
App

8711
06:00:22,370 --> 06:00:24,350
is unnecessary but it makes it way easier!

8712
06:00:25,330 --> 06:00:27,050
It makes it way easier!

8713
06:00:29,750 --> 06:00:33,190
To avoid the beep beep beep ones, you know?

8714
06:00:34,510 --> 06:00:37,050
Oh, I just shot that into the ether.

8715
06:00:38,050 --> 06:00:38,610
There we go.

8716
06:00:39,650 --> 06:00:40,050
Ouch!

8717
06:00:40,050 --> 06:00:40,450
Ouch!

8718
06:00:40,470 --> 06:00:40,650
Ouch!

8719
06:00:40,650 --> 06:00:40,790
Ouch!

8720
06:00:40,790 --> 06:00:41,650
Oh my god!

8721
06:00:41,710 --> 06:00:42,090
Oh my god!

8722
06:00:42,090 --> 06:00:42,530
Oh my god!

8723
06:00:43,010 --> 06:00:43,710
Oh my god!

8724
06:00:43,790 --> 06:00:44,030
Oh my god!

8725
06:00:44,090 --> 06:00:44,430
Oh my god!

8726
06:00:46,550 --> 06:00:49,270
Sorry, I've been staring at the computer screen so much.

8727
06:00:49,330 --> 06:00:50,670
My contacts are drying out.

8728
06:00:52,090 --> 06:00:52,850
Get up, Raiden!

8729
06:00:52,990 --> 06:00:53,490
Get up, Raiden!

8730
06:01:00,910 --> 06:01:01,570
Oh shit.

8731
06:01:02,590 --> 06:01:03,350
Oh my god.

8732
06:01:03,970 --> 06:01:04,730
Oh my god.

8733
06:01:04,790 --> 06:01:05,130
Oh my god.

8734
06:01:05,230 --> 06:01:06,490
This is it for it.

8735
06:01:06,550 --> 06:01:06,930
It's over.

8736
06:01:07,390 --> 06:01:08,390
It's so over.

8737
06:01:08,530 --> 06:01:09,190
It's so jover.

8738
06:01:09,690 --> 06:01:10,690
It's so jover.

8739
06:01:14,680 --> 06:01:15,360
Oh shit.

8740
06:01:15,960 --> 06:01:16,360
No!

8741
06:01:18,200 --> 06:01:18,600
No!

8742
06:01:20,260 --> 06:01:20,660
Can't

8743
06:01:29,610 --> 06:01:30,110
even aim!

8744
06:01:31,850 --> 06:01:35,170
Oh my gosh, wait, we're on Rose!

8745
06:01:39,480 --> 06:01:40,280
Oh god.

8746
06:01:40,380 --> 06:01:40,760
Oh god.

8747
06:01:44,940 --> 06:01:46,000
Everybody's shooting at me!

8748
06:01:46,320 --> 06:01:46,960
Calm down!

8749
06:01:52,800 --> 06:01:53,240
Oh!

8750
06:01:53,240 --> 06:01:53,520
Ouch!

8751
06:01:53,560 --> 06:01:53,760
Ouch!

8752
06:01:53,800 --> 06:01:53,920
Ouch!

8753
06:01:53,920 --> 06:01:55,100
Oh gosh.

8754
06:01:55,280 --> 06:01:55,740
But we got him.

8755
06:01:55,800 --> 06:01:56,100
We got him.

8756
06:01:57,320 --> 06:01:57,980
Oh, hello?

8757
06:01:58,160 --> 06:01:58,460
Hello?

8758
06:02:00,260 --> 06:02:01,700
Oh, how many more?

8759
06:02:02,900 --> 06:02:03,760
How many more?

8760
06:02:18,320 --> 06:02:19,200
That was cruel.

8761
06:02:19,620 --> 06:02:21,280
That was so cruel!

8762
06:02:21,280 --> 06:02:21,360
That was so cruel!

8763
06:02:26,750 --> 06:02:29,130
How many more do I have?

8764
06:02:36,330 --> 06:02:36,930
Please!

8765
06:02:36,930 --> 06:02:37,910
Envoy suffering!

8766
06:02:54,740 --> 06:02:55,700
Just go quick.

8767
06:02:55,840 --> 06:02:56,640
Back to Jack B.

8768
06:02:56,680 --> 06:02:56,840
Quick!

8769
06:02:57,040 --> 06:02:57,600
Jack B.

8770
06:03:03,930 --> 06:03:05,490
I have one ration.

8771
06:03:05,930 --> 06:03:06,750
Oh, jeez.

8772
06:03:06,750 --> 06:03:06,950
God.

8773
06:03:17,560 --> 06:03:18,620
It's so over.

8774
06:03:20,100 --> 06:03:20,580
No.

8775
06:03:20,980 --> 06:03:22,000
It's so over.

8776
06:03:47,410 --> 06:03:50,170
We were doing great boss only because I had the trap grenades!

8777
06:03:50,470 --> 06:03:52,410
Now I don't have the trap grenades anymore!

8778
06:03:53,910 --> 06:03:56,230
Oh gosh, you saved just like a few...

8779
06:03:56,230 --> 06:03:56,890
Oh my god.

8780
06:03:57,470 --> 06:04:00,170
I pressed X, but not soon enough, I guess.

8781
06:04:04,010 --> 06:04:07,190
What's the point of... What's the point of even running?

8782
06:04:07,230 --> 06:04:08,630
What's the point of even running?

8783
06:04:10,070 --> 06:04:11,070
What's the point?

8784
06:04:11,590 --> 06:04:12,670
What's the point?

8785
06:04:13,490 --> 06:04:14,670
Oh my god.

8786
06:04:15,350 --> 06:04:16,690
Oh my god.

8787
06:04:16,870 --> 06:04:17,810
Oh my god.

8788
06:04:17,810 --> 06:04:18,230
Oh my god.

8789
06:04:18,230 --> 06:04:18,590
Oh my god.

8790
06:04:18,610 --> 06:04:18,990
Oh my god.

8791
06:04:19,010 --> 06:04:19,370
Oh my god.

8792
06:04:19,370 --> 06:04:19,390
Oh my god.

8793
06:04:24,120 --> 06:04:24,560
Okay.

8794
06:04:24,860 --> 06:04:25,560
Okay, please.

8795
06:04:25,720 --> 06:04:26,740
I'm bleeding out!

8796
06:04:27,180 --> 06:04:28,180
I'm bleeding out!

8797
06:04:33,480 --> 06:04:34,620
This is it, you guys.

8798
06:04:34,820 --> 06:04:37,360
I don't want to have to do all of it over.

8799
06:04:37,740 --> 06:04:39,500
Oh shit.

8800
06:04:45,160 --> 06:04:46,140
Raiden, come in.

8801
06:04:47,260 --> 06:04:47,700
Raiden?

8802
06:04:47,920 --> 06:04:48,360
Raiden?

8803
06:04:50,140 --> 06:04:51,600
How many did I get through?

8804
06:04:52,280 --> 06:04:52,720
Like...

8805
06:04:52,720 --> 06:04:53,000
Like...

8806
06:04:53,000 --> 06:04:53,740
Three or four?

8807
06:04:54,820 --> 06:04:58,200
I think three or four of them I got through.

8808
06:04:58,980 --> 06:05:00,280
Oh gosh.

8809
06:05:02,140 --> 06:05:02,780
Oh.

8810
06:05:04,720 --> 06:05:05,040
Four.

8811
06:05:09,300 --> 06:05:11,380
You were on the last one?

8812
06:05:11,560 --> 06:05:12,520
No, I wasn't.

8813
06:05:12,700 --> 06:05:13,500
Oh god.

8814
06:05:14,720 --> 06:05:15,620
Five out of six.

8815
06:05:21,520 --> 06:05:22,160
Okay.

8816
06:05:22,440 --> 06:05:22,640
Okay.

8817
06:05:24,800 --> 06:05:28,040
One thing I know now is they always come in from the right side.

8818
06:05:28,740 --> 06:05:29,960
So I need to not...

8819
06:05:30,660 --> 06:05:31,260
A baby.

8820
06:05:31,400 --> 06:05:32,300
Actually, I don't know.

8821
06:05:32,380 --> 06:05:35,240
I feel like if I'm on the left side, they're going to hop on top of me right there.

8822
06:05:36,180 --> 06:05:37,500
Oh, my tummy hurts.

8823
06:05:38,580 --> 06:05:38,940
Okay.

8824
06:05:45,040 --> 06:05:47,100
Why didn't I pick up more chaff grenades?

8825
06:05:52,820 --> 06:05:54,060
Can you get more chaff?

8826
06:05:55,560 --> 06:05:55,920
Nope.

8827
06:06:13,500 --> 06:06:16,780
If you get the second stinger shot a little faster, you avoid the missiles.

8828
06:06:17,120 --> 06:06:18,000
I think if...

8829
06:06:18,000 --> 06:06:22,800
Well, maybe I should start shooting the guys in the back too because they also...

8830
06:06:22,800 --> 06:06:23,140
I don't know.

8831
06:06:23,600 --> 06:06:28,800
I would have to be very strategic about it because they also...

8832
06:06:28,800 --> 06:06:30,520
Like, I want to avoid their missiles as well.

8833
06:06:30,880 --> 06:06:31,460
They're the...

8834
06:06:31,460 --> 06:06:34,820
The beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep missiles are the ones that are really hard to avoid.

8835
06:06:35,360 --> 06:06:37,480
Like, they're the ones that make it difficult, I think.

8836
06:06:37,620 --> 06:06:38,640
Well, for me at least.

8837
06:06:39,140 --> 06:06:39,780
I don't know.

8838
06:06:43,980 --> 06:06:46,580
You were doing good until the ray utilized jumpscare tactics.

8839
06:06:51,160 --> 06:06:51,600
Armor.

8840
06:06:51,880 --> 06:06:52,520
Oh, shoot.

8841
06:06:52,600 --> 06:06:53,040
Oh, shoot.

8842
06:06:53,100 --> 06:06:53,520
Oh, shoot.

8843
06:06:53,580 --> 06:06:54,040
Oh, shoot.

8844
06:06:54,100 --> 06:06:54,540
Oh, shoot.

8845
06:06:54,600 --> 06:06:55,300
Oh, shoot, please.

8846
06:06:57,980 --> 06:06:58,720
Oh, my God.

8847
06:06:58,780 --> 06:07:00,060
I'm forgetting controls.

8848
06:07:00,260 --> 06:07:00,840
I'm forgetting controls.

8849
06:07:06,740 --> 06:07:08,100
Why am I forgetting controls?

8850
06:07:09,680 --> 06:07:10,960
Worst time to forget controls.

8851
06:07:13,100 --> 06:07:13,540
Oh.

8852
06:07:15,850 --> 06:07:16,530
It's these.

8853
06:07:16,850 --> 06:07:17,310
It's these.

8854
06:07:45,580 --> 06:07:47,560
This one here.

8855
06:08:01,390 --> 06:08:01,950
Travel水?

8856
06:08:04,990 --> 06:08:06,050
I got these.

8857
06:08:06,190 --> 06:08:08,810
Oh, these during the play fails?

8858
06:08:08,830 --> 06:08:09,510
I didn't know there were those in game plan...

8859
06:08:09,510 --> 06:08:09,570
Oh, sorry, I forget trilogies.

8860
06:08:09,570 --> 06:08:12,810
Ar duo?Ar duo.

8861
06:08:12,810 --> 06:08:13,630
Ar duo?

8862
06:08:13,630 --> 06:08:13,790
Ar all this?

8863
06:08:13,790 --> 06:08:15,290
Ar duo.

8864
06:08:15,290 --> 06:08:15,370
Ar duo.

8865
06:08:15,390 --> 06:08:15,390
Right.

8866
06:08:15,390 --> 06:08:15,530
Ar duo.

8867
06:08:15,530 --> 06:08:15,790
Ar duo.

8868
06:08:15,790 --> 06:08:16,110
Hey, it's not gusta, I think I got it right.

8869
06:08:16,170 --> 06:08:16,170
I got it wrong.

8870
06:08:16,210 --> 06:08:16,250
Ar duo.

8871
06:08:16,250 --> 06:08:16,290
Ar duo.

8872
06:08:16,290 --> 06:08:16,510
Ar duo.

8873
06:08:16,510 --> 06:08:18,310
They don't stop coming!

8874
06:08:18,490 --> 06:08:19,610
They don't stop coming!

8875
06:08:19,850 --> 06:08:21,170
They don't stop coming!

8876
06:08:21,970 --> 06:08:26,190
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13...

8877
06:08:27,230 --> 06:08:28,610
They don't stop coming!

8878
06:08:28,730 --> 06:08:29,530
They don't stop...

8879
06:08:29,530 --> 06:08:30,250
See?

8880
06:08:30,430 --> 06:08:33,550
This is why I'm just like... I can't get a shot in.

8881
06:08:42,420 --> 06:08:42,820
Raiden!

8882
06:09:01,840 --> 06:09:03,840
Maybe if I do get closer...

8883
06:09:03,840 --> 06:09:06,160
But then they all start blasting at me.

8884
06:09:17,870 --> 06:09:18,910
Are you gonna come up?

8885
06:09:19,350 --> 06:09:20,390
Are you coming up now?

8886
06:09:21,490 --> 06:09:22,430
Are you hopping up?

8887
06:09:22,510 --> 06:09:22,690
No?

8888
06:09:22,910 --> 06:09:23,190
Okay.

8889
06:09:26,590 --> 06:09:27,430
You're not hopping up.

8890
06:09:27,470 --> 06:09:27,850
Look at them!

8891
06:09:27,890 --> 06:09:28,970
Look at them staring at me!

8892
06:09:31,250 --> 06:09:32,690
Stop looking at me, you!

8893
06:09:32,990 --> 06:09:33,910
Stop watching!

8894
06:09:37,890 --> 06:09:38,970
Oh my god.

8895
06:09:39,030 --> 06:09:40,530
Even dodging it does nothing.

8896
06:09:43,150 --> 06:09:44,030
Raiden, get up!

8897
06:09:44,090 --> 06:09:44,810
Get up Raiden!

8898
06:10:06,330 --> 06:10:07,710
What the... Why did you duck?

8899
06:10:08,010 --> 06:10:09,030
Why did you duck?

8900
06:10:09,570 --> 06:10:10,710
Why did you do that?

8901
06:10:21,100 --> 06:10:21,840
Ray down.

8902
06:10:36,210 --> 06:10:36,930
Oh my god.

8903
06:10:36,970 --> 06:10:37,450
No, wait!

8904
06:10:38,330 --> 06:10:38,770
Wrong!

8905
06:10:39,370 --> 06:10:39,810
Wrong!

8906
06:10:43,470 --> 06:10:45,150
Here's the guy that's coming next though, right?

8907
06:10:45,170 --> 06:10:45,630
You're coming.

8908
06:10:45,710 --> 06:10:45,870
Yeah.

8909
06:10:46,290 --> 06:10:47,510
You're hopping up next.

8910
06:10:47,650 --> 06:10:47,970
I know.

8911
06:10:48,970 --> 06:10:49,610
I know.

8912
06:10:50,410 --> 06:10:51,130
I know.

8913
06:10:51,190 --> 06:10:51,510
I know.

8914
06:10:52,150 --> 06:10:53,530
I know your game now.

8915
06:10:54,570 --> 06:10:56,010
I know your game now.

8916
06:10:59,990 --> 06:11:00,470
Oh.

8917
06:11:00,890 --> 06:11:01,370
Wait.

8918
06:11:03,300 --> 06:11:04,700
I missed it somehow.

8919
06:11:12,330 --> 06:11:14,290
Next guy comes walking on in.

8920
06:11:16,010 --> 06:11:16,490
Oh.

8921
06:11:16,790 --> 06:11:17,850
I see him.

8922
06:11:18,850 --> 06:11:19,330
Um...

8923
06:11:25,510 --> 06:11:26,410
Raiden, come in.

8924
06:11:27,450 --> 06:11:27,930
Raiden?

8925
06:11:28,170 --> 06:11:28,650
Raiden?

8926
06:12:02,510 --> 06:12:03,870
What the hell was that?

8927
06:12:04,010 --> 06:12:04,310
Oh.

8928
06:12:04,810 --> 06:12:06,470
He's so fast when he's here.

8929
06:12:06,750 --> 06:12:06,970
Oh.

8930
06:12:07,090 --> 06:12:08,210
You're not coming up yet.

8931
06:12:08,410 --> 06:12:08,850
No, no, no.

8932
06:12:11,190 --> 06:12:12,430
No, no, no.

8933
06:12:12,430 --> 06:12:12,630
No, no, no.

8934
06:12:12,630 --> 06:12:13,090
No,

8935
06:12:17,050 --> 06:12:17,050
no, no.

8936
06:12:17,050 --> 06:12:17,430
No, no, no.

8937
06:12:17,430 --> 06:12:17,490
No, no, no.

8938
06:12:17,490 --> 06:12:17,750
No, no, no.

8939
06:12:18,690 --> 06:12:19,770
No, no, no.

8940
06:12:19,770 --> 06:12:20,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

8941
06:12:24,720 --> 06:12:25,900
Now he's coming up.

8942
06:12:26,860 --> 06:12:27,740
Oh my god.

8943
06:12:28,020 --> 06:12:29,420
Where are my rations?

8944
06:12:30,540 --> 06:12:31,300
Oh my god.

8945
06:12:31,300 --> 06:12:31,960
Raiden, please.

8946
06:12:34,180 --> 06:12:35,460
This is so funny.

8947
06:12:35,580 --> 06:12:37,020
Why don't I get invincible?

8948
06:12:46,920 --> 06:12:47,680
Just kill me.

8949
06:12:47,740 --> 06:12:48,220
Just kill me.

8950
06:12:48,260 --> 06:12:48,820
Just kill me.

8951
06:12:48,860 --> 06:12:49,420
Just kill me.

8952
06:12:58,020 --> 06:12:58,460
What?

8953
06:13:00,400 --> 06:13:02,540
I was standing right there.

8954
06:13:05,260 --> 06:13:06,240
Raiden, come in.

8955
06:13:07,300 --> 06:13:07,740
Raiden?

8956
06:13:08,060 --> 06:13:08,500
Raiden?

8957
06:13:30,790 --> 06:13:31,230
Oh.

8958
06:13:31,230 --> 06:13:31,670
Ouch.

8959
06:13:31,950 --> 06:13:32,690
Oh shoot.

8960
06:13:32,910 --> 06:13:33,550
Oh shit.

8961
06:13:35,190 --> 06:13:36,970
I forgot to do my rations.

8962
06:13:37,290 --> 06:13:37,730
Oh.

8963
06:13:37,790 --> 06:13:39,250
My body armor.

8964
06:13:41,910 --> 06:13:42,670
Oh my god.

8965
06:13:42,710 --> 06:13:43,510
Please, Raiden.

8966
06:13:43,550 --> 06:13:43,750
Move.

8967
06:13:44,350 --> 06:13:45,730
Keep going, Raiden.

8968
06:13:45,750 --> 06:13:46,730
Just get out of here.

8969
06:13:47,350 --> 06:13:47,950
Oh no.

8970
06:13:48,290 --> 06:13:48,730
Okay.

8971
06:13:50,010 --> 06:13:50,450
Oh.

8972
06:13:56,830 --> 06:13:57,090
Oh.

8973
06:13:57,110 --> 06:13:57,990
I missed my chance.

8974
06:13:58,390 --> 06:13:58,970
And I missed my chance.

8975
06:13:58,970 --> 06:14:01,910
I also... I also just...

8976
06:14:01,910 --> 06:14:02,150
Oh.

8977
06:14:02,950 --> 06:14:03,470
Guys.

8978
06:14:03,530 --> 06:14:03,890
Oh god.

8979
06:14:03,970 --> 06:14:04,270
I...

8980
06:14:04,270 --> 06:14:05,710
I don't believe.

8981
06:14:05,890 --> 06:14:06,410
I don't...

8982
06:14:06,410 --> 06:14:08,310
Why is your aim... Why do you...

8983
06:14:08,310 --> 06:14:09,070
Oh my god.

8984
06:14:09,110 --> 06:14:09,590
Run, run, run.

8985
06:14:09,710 --> 06:14:10,410
Run, Raiden.

8986
06:14:10,630 --> 06:14:11,490
Oh, thank god.

8987
06:14:18,950 --> 06:14:20,050
That's one down.

8988
06:14:32,890 --> 06:14:34,190
Come on up.

8989
06:14:34,670 --> 06:14:35,670
Come on up.

8990
06:14:45,460 --> 06:14:47,320
Even with body armor...

8991
06:14:48,960 --> 06:14:49,340
Raiden.

8992
06:14:49,340 --> 06:14:49,720
Raiden.

8993
06:14:50,300 --> 06:14:52,760
Even with body armor, they hit so hard.

8994
06:15:09,170 --> 06:15:09,770
Oh my god.

8995
06:15:37,160 --> 06:15:38,580
Stop shooting at me.

8996
06:15:45,200 --> 06:15:45,580
Okay.

8997
06:15:45,700 --> 06:15:46,080
Oh.

8998
06:15:46,140 --> 06:15:46,340
Shoot.

8999
06:15:46,420 --> 06:15:46,560
Shoot.

9000
06:15:46,620 --> 06:15:46,740
Shoot.

9001
06:15:46,740 --> 06:15:46,800
Shoot.

9002
06:15:46,940 --> 06:15:47,400
Here it goes.

9003
06:15:48,260 --> 06:15:48,640
Raiden.

9004
06:15:48,680 --> 06:15:49,020
Get up.

9005
06:15:49,080 --> 06:15:49,280
Get up.

9006
06:15:49,340 --> 06:15:49,480
Get up.

9007
06:15:49,480 --> 06:15:49,640
Get up.

9008
06:15:50,160 --> 06:15:50,540
Please.

9009
06:15:52,900 --> 06:15:53,280
Okay.

9010
06:15:53,360 --> 06:15:54,700
Now it's time to change.

9011
06:15:54,720 --> 06:15:54,920
Jeff.

9012
06:15:54,920 --> 06:15:55,140
Jeff.

9013
06:15:55,460 --> 06:15:55,620
Jeff.

9014
06:15:55,620 --> 06:15:55,980
Jeff.

9015
06:15:56,400 --> 06:15:56,840
Jeff.

9016
06:15:57,200 --> 06:15:57,360
Jeff.

9017
06:15:57,540 --> 06:15:57,660
Jeff.

9018
06:15:57,660 --> 06:15:58,060
Where's my...

9019
06:16:07,080 --> 06:16:07,520
Guys.

9020
06:16:09,560 --> 06:16:10,000
Guys.

9021
06:16:10,180 --> 06:16:10,800
I'm not...

9022
06:16:10,800 --> 06:16:12,880
I'm not feeling so good.

9023
06:16:15,040 --> 06:16:15,480
Guys.

9024
06:16:15,660 --> 06:16:17,480
I'm not feeling so good.

9025
06:16:20,420 --> 06:16:23,080
While I wait, I should really take out like some other...

9026
06:16:23,080 --> 06:16:24,320
Should really do some other things.

9027
06:16:24,800 --> 06:16:25,240
Oh.

9028
06:16:25,340 --> 06:16:25,860
He's leaving.

9029
06:16:26,000 --> 06:16:26,340
Oh.

9030
06:16:26,440 --> 06:16:26,760
Shoot.

9031
06:16:26,860 --> 06:16:27,260
Oh shoot.

9032
06:16:27,440 --> 06:16:27,780
Oh shoot.

9033
06:16:27,880 --> 06:16:28,240
Oh shoot.

9034
06:16:28,360 --> 06:16:30,560
I missed my opportunity.

9035
06:16:30,560 --> 06:16:31,340
I didn't notice.

9036
06:16:33,320 --> 06:16:33,760
I

9037
06:16:39,730 --> 06:16:41,290
didn't notice that he was down.

9038
06:16:42,290 --> 06:16:44,110
I missed my window of opportunity.

9039
06:16:45,750 --> 06:16:46,410
Oh my god.

9040
06:16:46,470 --> 06:16:47,230
Both of you guys.

9041
06:16:47,810 --> 06:16:47,830
Oh.

9042
06:16:52,940 --> 06:16:53,380
Ouch.

9043
06:16:53,780 --> 06:16:54,620
Why is...

9044
06:16:54,620 --> 06:16:55,160
Why am I...

9045
06:16:55,160 --> 06:16:56,400
What's the point of dodging?

9046
06:16:56,600 --> 06:16:57,300
If it's...

9047
06:16:57,300 --> 06:16:57,780
If...

9048
06:16:57,780 --> 06:16:59,060
Even when I'm in midair.

9049
06:16:59,320 --> 06:17:00,200
Nothing happens.

9050
06:17:00,280 --> 06:17:01,620
What's the point of dodging?

9051
06:17:01,780 --> 06:17:03,120
What's the point of dodging?

9052
06:17:06,240 --> 06:17:07,300
Don't fall off.

9053
06:17:07,520 --> 06:17:09,020
Don't fall off, Raiden.

9054
06:17:13,080 --> 06:17:13,880
And you.

9055
06:17:14,180 --> 06:17:15,080
Take him out.

9056
06:17:15,340 --> 06:17:18,040
I'm just getting their legs so that they...

9057
06:17:18,040 --> 06:17:18,680
Well.

9058
06:17:19,080 --> 06:17:19,680
Hopefully.

9059
06:17:20,240 --> 06:17:22,200
I just realized also...

9060
06:17:22,200 --> 06:17:23,460
I need a Jeff.

9061
06:17:25,020 --> 06:17:25,620
Jeff.

9062
06:17:25,920 --> 06:17:26,740
Did I...

9063
06:17:26,740 --> 06:17:27,300
Did I...

9064
06:17:27,300 --> 06:17:27,900
No.

9065
06:17:28,060 --> 06:17:28,740
I didn't.

9066
06:17:28,840 --> 06:17:29,560
There we go.

9067
06:17:33,080 --> 06:17:33,680
Okay.

9068
06:17:34,180 --> 06:17:34,780
Okay.

9069
06:17:35,120 --> 06:17:35,900
Oh gosh.

9070
06:17:36,200 --> 06:17:36,800
Okay.

9071
06:17:45,810 --> 06:17:46,350
What's the point of dodging?

9072
06:17:46,350 --> 06:17:47,090
Because if they're like...

9073
06:17:47,090 --> 06:17:48,350
You know, if they're...

9074
06:17:49,210 --> 06:17:49,670
Down...

9075
06:17:50,430 --> 06:17:51,730
Then, they're less likely...

9076
06:17:51,730 --> 06:17:52,870
Even though I'm not hitting them.

9077
06:17:53,730 --> 06:17:55,530
They're less likely to shoot out.

9078
06:17:55,610 --> 06:17:55,890
You know?

9079
06:17:57,970 --> 06:17:58,430
Oh...

9080
06:17:58,430 --> 06:17:59,290
Well that was...

9081
06:17:59,290 --> 06:17:59,650
Woah.

9082
06:18:01,690 --> 06:18:03,250
Why do you have so much ammo?

9083
06:18:03,510 --> 06:18:03,850
Oh okay.

9084
06:18:03,910 --> 06:18:04,090
Here.

9085
06:18:04,710 --> 06:18:05,110
Okay.

9086
06:18:11,640 --> 06:18:12,440
Little waist.

9087
06:18:13,800 --> 06:18:14,720
It's fine though.

9088
06:18:14,780 --> 06:18:15,140
It's fine.

9089
06:18:20,640 --> 06:18:21,400
Oh my god.

9090
06:18:21,960 --> 06:18:22,420
What do you want?

9091
06:18:33,980 --> 06:18:34,420
Shit.

9092
06:18:34,720 --> 06:18:35,780
Oh, I still got it.

9093
06:18:35,840 --> 06:18:36,540
My ration!

9094
06:18:42,570 --> 06:18:43,450
My ration!

9095
06:18:49,090 --> 06:18:52,990
So three... oh shit.

9096
06:18:54,050 --> 06:18:57,250
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

9097
06:18:58,210 --> 06:18:59,070
Run, run!

9098
06:18:59,170 --> 06:19:00,270
There's another ration over here.

9099
06:19:00,810 --> 06:19:02,090
I wonder if I can get it.

9100
06:19:02,190 --> 06:19:02,330
Wait.

9101
06:19:02,470 --> 06:19:02,790
Oh.

9102
06:19:02,970 --> 06:19:04,190
No, that's not a ration.

9103
06:19:05,530 --> 06:19:06,250
Oh.

9104
06:19:06,410 --> 06:19:08,090
Stinger, rocket, bow.

9105
06:19:08,550 --> 06:19:09,850
There's something over here.

9106
06:19:10,210 --> 06:19:11,910
Oh, more bullets.

9107
06:19:12,510 --> 06:19:13,430
No chop.

9108
06:19:14,090 --> 06:19:14,810
Shit.

9109
06:19:15,930 --> 06:19:20,590
I've lost it.

9110
06:19:21,870 --> 06:19:23,290
I've lost everything.

9111
06:19:23,650 --> 06:19:24,610
I've lost all control.

9112
06:19:25,230 --> 06:19:26,230
I give up.

9113
06:19:26,330 --> 06:19:28,550
I don't want to play anymore.

9114
06:19:29,870 --> 06:19:31,510
Why don't you run?

9115
06:19:34,190 --> 06:19:35,230
I don't want to play.

9116
06:19:37,190 --> 06:19:40,870
I don't want to play anymore.

9117
06:19:42,090 --> 06:19:44,680
Oh god.

9118
06:19:44,840 --> 06:19:45,540
That was so close.

9119
06:19:45,720 --> 06:19:46,560
Holy shit.

9120
06:19:46,720 --> 06:19:47,720
Oh my god.

9121
06:19:47,800 --> 06:19:48,300
Oh my god.

9122
06:19:48,340 --> 06:19:48,800
Oh my god.

9123
06:19:48,820 --> 06:19:49,360
Get the ration.

9124
06:19:49,600 --> 06:19:49,900
No!

9125
06:20:00,900 --> 06:20:02,820
I'm sick of this game.

9126
06:20:03,440 --> 06:20:05,080
This game sucks.

9127
06:20:08,420 --> 06:20:10,180
I'm sick of this game.

9128
06:20:10,300 --> 06:20:11,580
I'm sick of this game.

9129
06:20:12,020 --> 06:20:13,600
I'm sick of this game.

9130
06:20:13,600 --> 06:20:13,940
Oh.

9131
06:20:14,080 --> 06:20:14,760
Why did I?

9132
06:20:14,800 --> 06:20:15,280
Why did I?

9133
06:20:16,100 --> 06:20:17,640
Why did I?

9134
06:20:19,040 --> 06:20:20,020
Why did I?

9135
06:20:20,180 --> 06:20:20,320
Why?

9136
06:20:20,460 --> 06:20:20,800
Oh.

9137
06:20:20,880 --> 06:20:21,580
I got him still.

9138
06:20:21,800 --> 06:20:22,280
Nice.

9139
06:20:24,160 --> 06:20:25,340
Take him out at least.

9140
06:20:25,700 --> 06:20:26,420
Come on.

9141
06:20:26,420 --> 06:20:26,860
Come on out.

9142
06:20:36,840 --> 06:20:37,540
Number four!

9143
06:20:40,100 --> 06:20:41,060
Number four!

9144
06:20:46,220 --> 06:20:47,080
What's the point?

9145
06:20:51,740 --> 06:20:52,220
Okay.

9146
06:20:53,960 --> 06:20:54,440
Stinger!

9147
06:21:15,160 --> 06:21:16,020
Why am I doing this?

9148
06:21:16,020 --> 06:21:18,180
It's all just some simulation.

9149
06:21:18,960 --> 06:21:20,160
It's just a simulation!

9150
06:21:23,080 --> 06:21:23,680
Oh my god.

9151
06:21:23,700 --> 06:21:26,540
They gave me another... They gave me another ration though.

9152
06:21:30,140 --> 06:21:30,540
Please.

9153
06:21:30,700 --> 06:21:30,960
No!

9154
06:21:31,160 --> 06:21:32,040
I missed it.

9155
06:21:32,100 --> 06:21:32,960
I messed up.

9156
06:21:33,000 --> 06:21:33,740
I messed up.

9157
06:21:33,780 --> 06:21:34,680
I messed up.

9158
06:21:34,700 --> 06:21:35,280
I messed up.

9159
06:21:35,280 --> 06:21:35,540
I messed up.

9160
06:21:35,540 --> 06:21:35,740
I messed up.

9161
06:21:35,840 --> 06:21:37,120
Run him in between his legs.

9162
06:21:37,260 --> 06:21:37,580
Yeah.

9163
06:21:37,640 --> 06:21:37,780
Yeah.

9164
06:21:37,860 --> 06:21:38,020
Yeah.

9165
06:21:38,020 --> 06:21:38,160
Yeah.

9166
06:21:38,160 --> 06:21:38,320
Yeah.

9167
06:21:38,420 --> 06:21:39,700
Run him between his legs.

9168
06:21:40,540 --> 06:21:42,040
Run him between his legs.

9169
06:21:46,960 --> 06:21:48,240
I'm gonna use it now.

9170
06:21:51,690 --> 06:21:54,840
Where's my... Where's my... Where's my body armor?

9171
06:21:57,140 --> 06:21:58,700
Why are we here?

9172
06:21:59,730 --> 06:22:00,940
Just to suffer!

9173
06:22:02,680 --> 06:22:04,580
Why are we here?

9174
06:22:07,680 --> 06:22:08,380
Stinger!

9175
06:22:08,420 --> 06:22:08,660
Stinger!

9176
06:22:08,780 --> 06:22:09,000
Stinger!

9177
06:22:10,260 --> 06:22:10,960
Okay.

9178
06:22:11,100 --> 06:22:11,540
Nice.

9179
06:22:12,600 --> 06:22:13,920
And the kisser!

9180
06:22:16,720 --> 06:22:17,160
Boop!

9181
06:22:19,980 --> 06:22:21,240
Ah, boop, boop, boop, boop.

9182
06:22:21,900 --> 06:22:23,200
Ah, I hope I hit!

9183
06:22:24,500 --> 06:22:25,280
I did!

9184
06:22:25,920 --> 06:22:26,360
Yippee!

9185
06:22:27,300 --> 06:22:27,740
Okay.

9186
06:22:28,140 --> 06:22:28,980
Your turn!

9187
06:22:29,660 --> 06:22:30,440
Your turn!

9188
06:22:32,660 --> 06:22:33,100
Yep!

9189
06:22:34,680 --> 06:22:35,860
And the kisser!

9190
06:22:36,200 --> 06:22:37,720
Oh my

9191
06:22:47,630 --> 06:22:47,750
god.

9192
06:22:47,790 --> 06:22:48,010
Raiden!

9193
06:22:48,110 --> 06:22:48,610
Raiden, please.

9194
06:22:48,850 --> 06:22:51,390
I hate... I hate that mechanic more than anything, I think.

9195
06:22:51,970 --> 06:22:52,690
Oh shit!

9196
06:22:52,730 --> 06:22:52,990
Oh shit!

9197
06:22:53,010 --> 06:22:53,270
Oh shit!

9198
06:22:53,290 --> 06:22:53,570
Oh shit!

9199
06:22:53,870 --> 06:22:55,390
Just stay on the chat.

9200
06:22:55,750 --> 06:22:56,190
Ok.

9201
06:22:56,910 --> 06:22:57,490
There we go.

9202
06:22:58,090 --> 06:22:58,650
Tactical.

9203
06:22:58,690 --> 06:22:59,250
Tactical.

9204
06:22:59,450 --> 06:22:59,750
Okay.

9205
06:23:09,680 --> 06:23:11,040
Oh, thank you.

9206
06:23:27,360 --> 06:23:28,400
Which one's next?

9207
06:23:29,380 --> 06:23:33,000
Oh, I think I went to trap the grenade too early.

9208
06:23:33,120 --> 06:23:33,800
But that's okay.

9209
06:23:35,800 --> 06:23:36,200
Stinger.

9210
06:23:36,520 --> 06:23:36,880
Stinger.

9211
06:23:37,100 --> 06:23:37,500
Stinger.

9212
06:23:38,160 --> 06:23:38,560
Stinger.

9213
06:23:38,560 --> 06:23:39,720
Oh, uh... Stinger.

9214
06:23:39,920 --> 06:23:40,220
Oh.

9215
06:23:43,290 --> 06:23:43,690
Stinger.

9216
06:23:43,910 --> 06:23:44,310
Stinger.

9217
06:23:44,570 --> 06:23:44,890
Stinger.

9218
06:23:47,070 --> 06:23:47,470
Stinger.

9219
06:23:47,830 --> 06:23:48,030
Stinger.

9220
06:23:48,270 --> 06:23:48,610
Stinger.

9221
06:23:49,370 --> 06:23:49,770
Get

9222
06:23:56,130 --> 06:23:56,430
the...

9223
06:23:56,430 --> 06:23:56,990
get you.

9224
06:23:57,050 --> 06:23:57,310
Get you.

9225
06:23:57,330 --> 06:23:57,570
Get you.

9226
06:23:57,730 --> 06:23:58,330
Get you.

9227
06:23:58,390 --> 06:23:58,650
Get you.

9228
06:23:58,670 --> 06:23:58,950
Get you.

9229
06:23:58,970 --> 06:23:59,290
Get you.

9230
06:23:59,450 --> 06:23:59,990
Get you.

9231
06:24:00,050 --> 06:24:00,270
Get you.

9232
06:24:00,330 --> 06:24:00,570
Get you.

9233
06:24:00,790 --> 06:24:01,190
No!

9234
06:24:01,370 --> 06:24:01,570
No!

9235
06:24:01,610 --> 06:24:01,790
No!

9236
06:24:01,810 --> 06:24:02,150
Wrong way!

9237
06:24:02,250 --> 06:24:03,270
There we go.

9238
06:24:03,350 --> 06:24:03,550
Oh.

9239
06:24:03,610 --> 06:24:04,770
I got him twice I think.

9240
06:24:06,330 --> 06:24:06,730
Whatever.

9241
06:24:07,890 --> 06:24:10,590
You guys, I think my sanity is kinda low.

9242
06:24:14,670 --> 06:24:14,870
Beep.

9243
06:24:14,870 --> 06:24:15,010
Beep.

9244
06:24:15,090 --> 06:24:15,270
Beep.

9245
06:24:17,130 --> 06:24:17,650
Stinger!

9246
06:24:17,910 --> 06:24:18,250
Stinger!

9247
06:24:18,410 --> 06:24:18,650
Stinger!

9248
06:24:19,570 --> 06:24:21,270
I hardly even know it.

9249
06:24:21,570 --> 06:24:22,650
And the kisser!

9250
06:24:23,810 --> 06:24:24,330
Yum.

9251
06:24:24,350 --> 06:24:24,510
Yum.

9252
06:24:24,590 --> 06:24:24,710
Yum.

9253
06:24:24,710 --> 06:24:24,930
Yum.

9254
06:24:24,930 --> 06:24:25,170
Yum.

9255
06:24:32,890 --> 06:24:33,410
Ouchie.

9256
06:24:33,410 --> 06:24:33,670
Ouch.

9257
06:24:34,170 --> 06:24:34,690
Ouchie.

9258
06:24:34,690 --> 06:24:34,950
Ouch.

9259
06:24:35,090 --> 06:24:35,810
Come on.

9260
06:24:35,830 --> 06:24:36,110
Come on.

9261
06:24:43,240 --> 06:24:44,340
Maybe two more.

9262
06:24:44,900 --> 06:24:45,700
Oh shit.

9263
06:24:45,800 --> 06:24:46,080
Oh shit.

9264
06:24:46,640 --> 06:24:47,900
Maybe two more.

9265
06:24:48,200 --> 06:24:49,480
I actually don't know anymore.

9266
06:24:54,600 --> 06:24:55,040
CHAAAALF!

9267
06:24:56,640 --> 06:24:57,520
Okay, more.

9268
06:25:08,980 --> 06:25:10,880
I thought that was the last one.

9269
06:25:11,020 --> 06:25:11,520
Not gonna lie.

9270
06:25:11,860 --> 06:25:13,400
I thought the other one was the last one.

9271
06:25:14,600 --> 06:25:17,060
I'm out of chaps.

9272
06:25:19,420 --> 06:25:20,680
Of course I am!

9273
06:25:20,900 --> 06:25:22,440
Of course I'm out of chaps!

9274
06:25:22,660 --> 06:25:24,460
Why wouldn't I be out of chaps?

9275
06:25:24,520 --> 06:25:25,580
That would be ridiculous otherwise!

9276
06:25:26,060 --> 06:25:27,640
Why wouldn't I be out of chaps?

9277
06:25:34,180 --> 06:25:34,620
Okay.

9278
06:25:35,340 --> 06:25:35,780
Recover!

9279
06:25:35,780 --> 06:25:36,220
Recover!

9280
06:25:36,360 --> 06:25:36,720
Recover!

9281
06:25:36,860 --> 06:25:37,160
There we go!

9282
06:25:37,880 --> 06:25:38,320
Nice!

9283
06:25:38,580 --> 06:25:42,640
Why do you get invincibility and I get nothing jack?

9284
06:25:42,760 --> 06:25:43,080
Poopy!

9285
06:25:48,960 --> 06:25:50,620
I know I don't need chaps!

9286
06:25:50,720 --> 06:25:51,820
But I like to have them!

9287
06:25:51,880 --> 06:25:52,900
They make it really easy!

9288
06:25:53,700 --> 06:25:54,980
They make it so much easier!

9289
06:26:21,640 --> 06:26:22,820
I'm so sweaty!

9290
06:26:27,360 --> 06:26:28,560
I'm so sweaty!

9291
06:26:28,820 --> 06:26:29,560
I'm so sweaty!

9292
06:26:29,640 --> 06:26:29,900
I'm so sweaty!

9293
06:26:30,180 --> 06:26:31,500
I'm so sweaty!

9294
06:26:32,120 --> 06:26:32,660
I'm so sweaty!

9295
06:26:32,660 --> 06:26:34,360
This game makes me go bonkers!

9296
06:26:34,380 --> 06:26:35,160
Not that game.

9297
06:26:35,460 --> 06:26:37,600
This fight makes me go bonkers for real!

9298
06:26:38,160 --> 06:26:40,680
Feels like I'm just in hell.

9299
06:26:41,000 --> 06:26:41,080
Feels like I'm just in hell.

9300
06:26:41,080 --> 06:26:42,620
You know, just never ending hell.

9301
06:26:42,800 --> 06:26:43,580
The same thing.

9302
06:26:45,000 --> 06:26:46,220
Over and over again.

9303
06:26:48,680 --> 06:26:49,220
Olga!

9304
06:26:51,640 --> 06:26:51,660
Olga!

9305
06:26:54,040 --> 06:26:54,980
What about now?

9306
06:26:58,100 --> 06:26:59,120
You did amazing!

9307
06:26:59,300 --> 06:26:59,700
Well done!

9308
06:26:59,960 --> 06:27:00,400
Thank you!

9309
06:27:00,420 --> 06:27:00,660
This is suicide!

9310
06:27:02,700 --> 06:27:03,380
Fuck you!

9311
06:27:03,460 --> 06:27:04,200
Thanks for the thing you did!

9312
06:27:04,500 --> 06:27:04,840
You are nanomachines.

9313
06:27:04,840 --> 06:27:07,280
They're transmitting your vital signs to the Patriots.

9314
06:27:07,280 --> 06:27:07,680
You are nanomachines.

9315
06:27:07,680 --> 06:27:07,680
They're transmitting your vital signs to the Patriots.

9316
06:27:07,680 --> 06:27:08,840
My hands are shaking so much.

9317
06:27:08,920 --> 06:27:11,960
If you die, my child dies.

9318
06:27:13,060 --> 06:27:13,540
Sorry.

9319
06:27:13,860 --> 06:27:16,260
Sorry I got a little extra during that fight, you guys.

9320
06:27:16,360 --> 06:27:16,920
I'm okay.

9321
06:27:17,340 --> 06:27:19,800
So that's why you sold your troops out to me.

9322
06:27:20,300 --> 06:27:21,540
So many dead.

9323
06:27:21,540 --> 06:27:23,460
They all died trusting you.

9324
06:27:24,800 --> 06:27:26,440
Were they your comrades?

9325
06:27:27,240 --> 06:27:28,940
No, they're not just comrades.

9326
06:27:29,260 --> 06:27:29,980
I'm okay.

9327
06:27:30,760 --> 06:27:31,280
I'm okay.

9328
06:27:31,960 --> 06:27:35,680
I have to like talk myself through those kinds of fights sometimes, you know?

9329
06:27:35,720 --> 06:27:36,260
I have to like talk myself through those kinds of fights sometimes, you know?

9330
06:27:36,260 --> 06:27:36,880
I have to be like, okay!

9331
06:27:37,880 --> 06:27:38,400
Unequip!

9332
06:27:38,400 --> 06:27:38,760
Equip!

9333
06:27:38,920 --> 06:27:39,440
Unequip!

9334
06:27:39,460 --> 06:27:39,760
Equip!

9335
06:27:40,020 --> 06:27:41,620
I have to like talk myself.

9336
06:27:41,920 --> 06:27:43,180
I have to be like, jump high!

9337
06:27:45,900 --> 06:27:47,060
It's how I focus.

9338
06:27:47,060 --> 06:27:48,280
See you in hell!

9339
06:27:49,700 --> 06:27:50,660
Oh god!

9340
06:27:59,040 --> 06:27:59,940
Don't do it.

9341
06:28:00,340 --> 06:28:01,260
Don't do it.

9342
06:28:04,020 --> 06:28:05,000
Don't do it!

9343
06:28:14,290 --> 06:28:14,830
Live!

9344
06:28:27,900 --> 06:28:30,800
I think we could have done a second take on that one.

9345
06:28:31,680 --> 06:28:32,500
Oh god.

9346
06:28:39,820 --> 06:28:40,940
Oh god.

9347
06:28:41,020 --> 06:28:41,180
Oh god.

9348
06:28:41,180 --> 06:28:42,500
Her death is so...

9349
06:28:45,320 --> 06:28:46,580
Feels so icky.

9350
06:28:46,580 --> 06:28:47,540
Enjoy the show, Jack.

9351
06:28:49,180 --> 06:28:51,040
Let's pick up where we left off.

9352
06:28:51,920 --> 06:28:55,170
Let's pick up where we left off.

9353
06:28:56,810 --> 06:28:57,910
Something's wrong with them.

9354
06:28:59,830 --> 06:29:00,930
What's going on?

9355
06:29:03,130 --> 06:29:03,790
What's going on?

9356
06:29:03,790 --> 06:29:04,150
What's wrong with it?

9357
06:29:04,150 --> 06:29:04,550
It's AI.

9358
06:29:05,190 --> 06:29:06,870
GW, it's out of control.

9359
06:29:07,330 --> 06:29:08,010
What?

9360
06:29:10,650 --> 06:29:12,830
Ooh, the way they shake is so creepy.

9361
06:29:13,470 --> 06:29:14,150
Ew!

9362
06:29:17,370 --> 06:29:18,670
So creepy.

9363
06:29:20,170 --> 06:29:21,310
I love it.

9364
06:29:21,490 --> 06:29:22,490
Oh god.

9365
06:29:25,910 --> 06:29:26,970
They're possessed.

9366
06:29:27,370 --> 06:29:28,270
A ghost in the machine.

9367
06:29:32,210 --> 06:29:32,890
GW.

9368
06:29:34,190 --> 06:29:35,590
Metal ray freaky.

9369
06:29:35,990 --> 06:29:39,710
I'm reading an abnormal impulse cascade throughout the neural network.

9370
06:29:39,710 --> 06:29:40,750
I want some chocolate.

9371
06:29:41,850 --> 06:29:42,550
What happened?

9372
06:29:42,930 --> 06:29:44,530
Maybe some kind of virus.

9373
06:29:44,850 --> 06:29:45,750
The Patriots?

9374
06:29:45,970 --> 06:29:46,570
I don't know.

9375
06:29:46,950 --> 06:29:48,850
Ocelot, what have you been up to?

9376
06:29:49,150 --> 06:29:49,870
It's too late.

9377
06:29:50,830 --> 06:29:53,090
Arsenal's system control is going haywire.

9378
06:29:54,370 --> 06:29:56,510
GW equals ghost wife?

9379
06:30:01,200 --> 06:30:02,220
The virus.

9380
06:30:08,320 --> 06:30:08,680
No!

9381
06:30:09,620 --> 06:30:10,220
Stupid machines.

9382
06:30:15,180 --> 06:30:16,240
Come on.

9383
06:30:18,460 --> 06:30:19,480
Oh my god.

9384
06:30:19,500 --> 06:30:21,000
He's turning superhero.

9385
06:30:26,980 --> 06:30:28,540
GW means goat?

9386
06:30:28,700 --> 06:30:29,960
George Washington?

9387
06:30:30,160 --> 06:30:31,180
No, no, no.

9388
06:30:31,720 --> 06:30:32,740
Ghost wife.

9389
06:30:35,180 --> 06:30:36,260
Ghost woman.

9390
06:30:37,460 --> 06:30:38,340
That's mean.

9391
06:30:41,920 --> 06:30:42,440
Yes!

9392
06:30:42,920 --> 06:30:43,440
Solidus!

9393
06:30:44,800 --> 06:30:47,160
Why does his gun work on it?

9394
06:30:47,220 --> 06:30:48,040
But not mine.

9395
06:30:49,080 --> 06:30:50,520
Actually, I don't know.

9396
06:30:50,560 --> 06:30:51,780
Does the gun work on it?

9397
06:30:52,360 --> 06:30:53,440
I imagine not.

9398
06:30:53,620 --> 06:30:55,160
Otacon told me to use the stinger missiles.

9399
06:30:57,120 --> 06:30:58,500
Damn the Patriots.

9400
06:30:58,880 --> 06:31:00,400
Damn the Patriots.

9401
06:31:05,910 --> 06:31:11,930
Solidus even having his little snake hair tuft is just so amazing.

9402
06:31:11,930 --> 06:31:15,030
You still have some use.

9403
06:31:18,070 --> 06:31:19,550
I've captured Snake.

9404
06:31:19,950 --> 06:31:20,370
What?

9405
06:31:22,850 --> 06:31:23,450
Snake!

9406
06:31:28,130 --> 06:31:28,730
Snake?

9407
06:31:29,570 --> 06:31:35,070
Snake, I just had to fight off like six Metal Gears.

9408
06:31:35,870 --> 06:31:36,470
Bring him in.

9409
06:31:36,850 --> 06:31:37,990
All by myself?

9410
06:31:38,370 --> 06:31:40,290
I might be better than you at this point.

9411
06:31:42,530 --> 06:31:43,910
You had a hindy.

9412
06:31:43,910 --> 06:31:44,910
I had a Harrier.

9413
06:31:45,070 --> 06:31:45,850
And if I...

9414
06:31:55,920 --> 06:31:57,400
Snake spilled his spaghetti.

9415
06:32:05,220 --> 06:32:06,880
You lack his charisma.

9416
06:32:07,140 --> 06:32:07,580
You know what?

9417
06:32:07,680 --> 06:32:08,360
You're so right.

9418
06:32:17,020 --> 06:32:18,060
The moon.

9419
06:32:18,380 --> 06:32:19,480
The moon is beautiful.

9420
06:32:23,500 --> 06:32:23,860
Snake!

9421
06:32:26,980 --> 06:32:30,540
I'll squeeze the answers out of you instead, my son.

9422
06:32:31,140 --> 06:32:31,260
I'll squeeze the answers out of you instead, my son.

9423
06:32:31,440 --> 06:32:32,340
I'll squeeze the answers out of you instead, my son.

9424
06:32:32,360 --> 06:32:33,160
Oh, oh!

9425
06:32:34,180 --> 06:32:34,540
Wait,

9426
06:32:38,880 --> 06:32:39,420
why isn't it...

9427
06:32:39,420 --> 06:32:40,340
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

9428
06:32:40,740 --> 06:32:41,360
Oh my god.

9429
06:32:41,480 --> 06:32:42,340
If you stop...

9430
06:32:42,720 --> 06:32:44,220
Okay, I was like, why is it still going down?

9431
06:32:50,060 --> 06:32:50,660
Oh my god.

9432
06:32:51,440 --> 06:32:51,800
Solidus!

9433
06:32:51,900 --> 06:32:52,160
Okay.

9434
06:32:54,900 --> 06:32:56,220
What do you hope to hear?

9435
06:32:56,880 --> 06:32:58,840
He's solid, but handcuffed by fortune.

9436
06:32:58,840 --> 06:33:00,980
It's not him I want the answers from.

9437
06:33:01,240 --> 06:33:02,580
I'm gonna look at Snake for...

9438
06:33:02,580 --> 06:33:03,920
Oh, I was gonna say for...

9439
06:33:04,800 --> 06:33:05,940
For moral support.

9440
06:33:06,440 --> 06:33:06,920
Ah!

9441
06:33:08,000 --> 06:33:09,220
Oh, I'm handcuffed.

9442
06:33:09,560 --> 06:33:10,380
What do you mean?

9443
06:33:11,700 --> 06:33:13,120
That's not your business.

9444
06:33:14,460 --> 06:33:15,180
Oh, really?

9445
06:33:15,860 --> 06:33:18,820
It so happens I have some business of my own to attend to.

9446
06:33:18,820 --> 06:33:20,020
I like that fortune's the only...

9447
06:33:20,660 --> 06:33:22,360
The only dead cell left.

9448
06:33:23,040 --> 06:33:25,500
You were going to screw me over, weren't you?

9449
06:33:25,600 --> 06:33:25,780
You were going to screw me over, weren't you?

9450
06:33:26,880 --> 06:33:28,140
You talked, Ocelot.

9451
06:33:29,200 --> 06:33:30,200
Not exactly.

9452
06:33:31,040 --> 06:33:35,000
I was the one who used Ocelot to suggest the idea to you in the first place.

9453
06:33:35,180 --> 06:33:35,340
Whoa!

9454
06:33:36,500 --> 06:33:37,020
What?

9455
06:33:37,200 --> 06:33:40,040
I was planning to give you Ocelot to begin with.

9456
06:33:40,300 --> 06:33:40,980
Ah, okay.

9457
06:33:41,400 --> 06:33:43,040
That is fine.

9458
06:33:43,860 --> 06:33:45,400
I'm no philanthropist.

9459
06:33:45,980 --> 06:33:47,760
Ocelot is far from impregnable.

9460
06:33:48,260 --> 06:33:50,440
It needs other Metalgears as guards.

9461
06:33:50,680 --> 06:33:52,340
A huge payload of warheads.

9462
06:33:53,000 --> 06:33:54,700
Solidus fighting Ray like that got inspired.

9463
06:33:55,440 --> 06:33:55,960
Solidus fighting Ray like that got inspired.

9464
06:33:56,880 --> 06:34:02,000
With just a large attack force without support, Arsenal is nothing more than a gigantic coffin.

9465
06:34:02,400 --> 06:34:05,500
Seizing Arsenal gear was never the real objective.

9466
06:34:05,860 --> 06:34:06,100
What?

9467
06:34:06,460 --> 06:34:08,140
What was your objective then?

9468
06:34:08,140 --> 06:34:10,080
Why does everybody just create things?

9469
06:34:11,040 --> 06:34:12,760
A list of names.

9470
06:34:13,180 --> 06:34:14,720
Of the Patriots!

9471
06:34:14,900 --> 06:34:15,020
Oh!

9472
06:34:16,960 --> 06:34:18,400
The Patriots!

9473
06:34:18,460 --> 06:34:24,100
They were planning to extend their control to digital information flow with GW and Arsenal.

9474
06:34:24,560 --> 06:34:30,100
That means the information they want to filter out is contained in GW.

9475
06:34:31,800 --> 06:34:36,300
Including that list of the highest 12 members of the Patriots' Wiseman's Committee.

9476
06:34:36,300 --> 06:34:37,540
I kinda wanna go get my cake.

9477
06:34:38,000 --> 06:34:42,320
And once you knew who they were, you would cross out their names one by one.

9478
06:34:42,700 --> 06:34:46,100
While we, with our useless arsenal, drew their fire.

9479
06:34:46,300 --> 06:34:48,680
I gotta finish it sooner or I'll go bad I think.

9480
06:34:48,760 --> 06:34:50,160
You were using us all along.

9481
06:34:50,400 --> 06:34:51,740
Were you any different?

9482
06:34:51,880 --> 06:34:55,720
But your plans hit a snag with GW destroyed, hasn't it?

9483
06:34:55,740 --> 06:34:56,260
Everybody...

9484
06:34:56,880 --> 06:35:00,300
Everybody double crosses, everybody triple crosses, everybody is just in it for themselves.

9485
06:35:00,300 --> 06:35:01,200
No, there is another way.

9486
06:35:02,260 --> 06:35:02,780
Really?

9487
06:35:03,860 --> 06:35:06,440
But we have our own plans to carry out.

9488
06:35:06,540 --> 06:35:07,640
I love fortunes.

9489
06:35:07,640 --> 06:35:10,040
We'll take the arsenal since you don't care for it anyway.

9490
06:35:10,600 --> 06:35:13,260
The purified hydrogen bomb is ready to go.

9491
06:35:13,480 --> 06:35:15,720
A nuclear strike won't stop them.

9492
06:35:17,120 --> 06:35:17,900
A nuclear strike won't stop them.

9493
06:35:17,900 --> 06:35:19,760
It will damage their power source.

9494
06:35:20,200 --> 06:35:20,340
It will damage their power source.

9495
06:35:20,760 --> 06:35:22,760
How is it possible to get so...

9496
06:35:22,760 --> 06:35:22,960
How is it possible to get so...

9497
06:35:23,640 --> 06:35:24,280
So...

9498
06:35:24,280 --> 06:35:26,060
Attached to characters.

9499
06:35:26,560 --> 06:35:28,460
In just a single video game.

9500
06:35:30,920 --> 06:35:32,100
Even Batman.

9501
06:35:32,320 --> 06:35:33,340
You see him once.

9502
06:35:33,520 --> 06:35:35,100
And I love him so much.

9503
06:35:38,840 --> 06:35:40,060
Oh boy.

9504
06:35:42,800 --> 06:35:43,780
Good riding.

9505
06:35:43,780 --> 06:35:47,680
What exactly do you find so funny?

9506
06:35:50,380 --> 06:35:51,940
Charades usually are humorous.

9507
06:35:52,380 --> 06:35:52,940
I played you.

9508
06:35:53,100 --> 06:35:53,860
I played you.

9509
06:35:53,940 --> 06:35:54,800
He's pointing at everybody.

9510
06:35:54,840 --> 06:35:55,440
Played you.

9511
06:35:55,600 --> 06:35:55,920
Played you.

9512
06:35:56,140 --> 06:35:59,120
But we're running a little short on time.

9513
06:36:00,040 --> 06:36:01,380
What are you talking about?

9514
06:36:01,700 --> 06:36:02,600
I played you.

9515
06:36:02,620 --> 06:36:03,040
I played you.

9516
06:36:03,040 --> 06:36:05,160
Everything you've done here has been scripted.

9517
06:36:05,200 --> 06:36:07,080
A little exercise set up by us.

9518
06:36:08,100 --> 06:36:09,300
Oh my god.

9519
06:36:09,460 --> 06:36:09,920
Exercise.

9520
06:36:10,680 --> 06:36:16,060
The S3 plan was conceived as a means to produce soldiers on par with Solid Snake.

9521
06:36:16,300 --> 06:36:16,380
Yeah.

9522
06:36:16,640 --> 06:36:17,880
That's what I told you.

9523
06:36:18,220 --> 06:36:19,660
Otacon and Fortune fell in love.

9524
06:36:19,780 --> 06:36:24,000
But the VR training the boy was put through is not the meat of the project.

9525
06:36:25,480 --> 06:36:27,020
Otacon's is too strong I think.

9526
06:36:27,620 --> 06:36:31,600
You think this little terrorist incident is your own doing, Solidus?

9527
06:36:32,180 --> 06:36:34,840
This is the S3 training, Colonel.

9528
06:36:35,280 --> 06:36:37,000
He looks so mad.

9529
06:36:37,460 --> 06:36:39,900
An orchestrated recreation of Shao Kahn.

9530
06:36:39,920 --> 06:36:40,460
Shadow Moses.

9531
06:36:40,940 --> 06:36:41,660
What?

9532
06:36:44,460 --> 06:36:46,600
Ames and the President's deaths.

9533
06:36:46,800 --> 06:36:48,760
You thought before was the recreation?

9534
06:36:49,080 --> 06:36:49,980
No, no, no.

9535
06:36:50,620 --> 06:36:53,180
The computer virus that mimics Fox Die.

9536
06:36:53,220 --> 06:36:56,600
This whole game has been the recreation of Shadow Moses.

9537
06:36:56,960 --> 06:36:57,700
This whole game has been the recreation of Shadow Moses.

9538
06:36:59,840 --> 06:37:04,020
Ames' own nano-machines were used to shut down his pacemaker.

9539
06:37:04,460 --> 06:37:04,620
Ames' own nano-machines were used to shut down his pacemaker.

9540
06:37:04,620 --> 06:37:05,320
Ah ha ha!

9541
06:37:08,280 --> 06:37:09,900
I arranged it.

9542
06:37:09,920 --> 06:37:10,980
Ain't no way.

9543
06:37:12,300 --> 06:37:13,380
Thanks, Peter.

9544
06:37:14,600 --> 06:37:22,760
As for the President, although Johnson realized what was going on, he played out his allotted part.

9545
06:37:23,740 --> 06:37:27,980
As for the computer virus, it's a digital counterpart of Fox Die.

9546
06:37:28,600 --> 06:37:35,060
It was also designed to eliminate every scrap of information regarding the Patriots from GW.

9547
06:37:36,760 --> 06:37:39,000
Your plan was invalidated.

9548
06:37:39,000 --> 06:37:39,660
Those birds.

9549
06:37:39,920 --> 06:37:42,040
Even before execution, so was...

9550
06:37:42,040 --> 06:37:43,820
Yeah, birds were paid actors, too.

9551
06:37:45,640 --> 06:37:47,240
Fat Man was a different story.

9552
06:37:47,600 --> 06:37:49,240
He's one of our own people.

9553
06:37:49,700 --> 06:37:55,520
A sort of examiner we hired to test the boy's progress before letting him tackle the exercise proper.

9554
06:37:56,680 --> 06:38:01,420
We had to arrange for Stillman's presence to coax the maniac into agreeing.

9555
06:38:02,700 --> 06:38:08,780
If the boy had allowed the Big Shell to be destroyed, this exercise would have ended there.

9556
06:38:08,780 --> 06:38:12,260
Fat Man just being his own thing is just so fitting for him.

9557
06:38:12,260 --> 06:38:13,840
The project has no room for failures.

9558
06:38:14,540 --> 06:38:16,780
Fat Man is just his own guy.

9559
06:38:17,460 --> 06:38:18,020
What do you mean?

9560
06:38:18,020 --> 06:38:22,780
Given the right situation, the right story, anyone can be shaped into Snake.

9561
06:38:25,300 --> 06:38:26,320
Even me!

9562
06:38:26,340 --> 06:38:28,400
Even rookies can fight like men of experience.

9563
06:38:28,860 --> 06:38:29,300
Even me!

9564
06:38:29,520 --> 06:38:30,920
I can become like Snake.

9565
06:38:32,000 --> 06:38:33,820
An instant creation of genius.

9566
06:38:33,820 --> 06:38:35,000
So it is not played like a damn fiddle.

9567
06:38:36,840 --> 06:38:38,760
An instant creation of genius.

9568
06:38:38,760 --> 06:38:42,500
A single journal will provide more than enough data to formulate such a program.

9569
06:38:43,880 --> 06:38:49,840
You, Dead Cell, Olga, you're all nothing but pawns...

9570
06:38:49,840 --> 06:38:50,160
Pawns!

9571
06:38:50,160 --> 06:38:50,180
Pawns!

9572
06:38:50,180 --> 06:38:50,200
Pawns!

9573
06:38:50,200 --> 06:38:52,160
...placed to create the perfect simulation.

9574
06:38:53,060 --> 06:38:55,500
Also, I've never met someone that he couldn't double-cry.

9575
06:38:55,940 --> 06:39:03,200
Solidus, you and the boy were selected because your relationship resembles the one between Snake and Big Boss.

9576
06:39:03,400 --> 06:39:03,760
Pawns!

9577
06:39:04,660 --> 06:39:08,740
Fortune, you and the rest of Dead Cell stand in for the Foxhound's victory.

9578
06:39:08,760 --> 06:39:11,220
And you are part of the team which Snake took on in Shadow Moses.

9579
06:39:11,900 --> 06:39:16,240
You're the most impressive collect of freaks outside Foxhound.

9580
06:39:16,240 --> 06:39:17,840
They never met freaky phantom.

9581
06:39:19,420 --> 06:39:22,620
We have gone to a lot of trouble to set you up against the boy.

9582
06:39:22,800 --> 06:39:25,460
That story about purified hydrogon bonds...

9583
06:39:25,460 --> 06:39:25,600
The boy.

9584
06:39:25,620 --> 06:39:26,920
Just the tip of the iceberg.

9585
06:39:28,220 --> 06:39:29,140
I'm a freak too!

9586
06:39:29,800 --> 06:39:33,880
...when I sunk that tanker along with your old man two years ago.

9587
06:39:36,120 --> 06:39:38,700
...throwing your husband in the brig was a part of it too.

9588
06:39:38,700 --> 06:39:44,620
You were told that the eradication of Dead Cell six months ago was an act of the Patriots.

9589
06:39:44,680 --> 06:39:47,720
We provoked and encouraged your hatred.

9590
06:39:48,060 --> 06:39:50,820
Never go against a woman scorned.

9591
06:39:50,820 --> 06:39:53,940
And you opted for vengeance, just as we planned.

9592
06:39:54,740 --> 06:39:56,360
Just as we planned.

9593
06:39:57,900 --> 06:39:59,980
The way he says that is so funny.

9594
06:39:59,980 --> 06:40:02,380
Except for the appearance of the real Solid Snake.

9595
06:40:02,940 --> 06:40:05,740
He looks like he's like, oopsie.

9596
06:40:05,740 --> 06:40:07,520
Now, who sent for you?

9597
06:40:09,020 --> 06:40:11,240
All our misfortune was...

9598
06:40:12,260 --> 06:40:14,120
just a part of their project?

9599
06:40:20,600 --> 06:40:22,600
But you can't hit her.

9600
06:40:30,530 --> 06:40:31,970
How could...

9601
06:40:32,510 --> 06:40:33,930
You're no Lady Luck.

9602
06:40:34,090 --> 06:40:37,170
You have nothing that we didn't give you.

9603
06:40:40,830 --> 06:40:41,910
No, fortune!

9604
06:40:42,250 --> 06:40:42,470
What?

9605
06:40:50,890 --> 06:40:54,010
Do you know why no bullet could hit you?

9606
06:40:54,630 --> 06:40:55,970
It wasn't magic.

9607
06:40:56,250 --> 06:40:58,370
Or some new age mumbo jumbo.

9608
06:40:58,530 --> 06:41:00,930
It certainly wasn't your psychic talents.

9609
06:41:01,430 --> 06:41:03,750
It was all staged by the Patriots.

9610
06:41:03,910 --> 06:41:05,090
The Patriots?

9611
06:41:05,110 --> 06:41:06,470
What can they not do?

9612
06:41:08,700 --> 06:41:11,730
You were being shielded by the electromagnetic weapons...

9613
06:41:11,930 --> 06:41:13,830
and technology that the Patriots developed.

9614
06:41:15,510 --> 06:41:16,890
Oh my god.

9615
06:41:16,890 --> 06:41:20,090
Your dead cell comrades loved your father and husband.

9616
06:41:20,570 --> 06:41:24,990
We needed a pathetic wretch like you...

9617
06:41:24,990 --> 06:41:26,670
to keep them focused.

9618
06:41:28,510 --> 06:41:30,390
You've been our puppet all along.

9619
06:41:30,590 --> 06:41:31,690
Just like Olga.

9620
06:41:32,530 --> 06:41:33,790
Oh my god.

9621
06:41:33,990 --> 06:41:34,130
No!

9622
06:41:34,310 --> 06:41:35,790
The Patriots are just...

9623
06:41:35,790 --> 06:41:36,970
The Patriots this, the Patriots that.

9624
06:41:36,970 --> 06:41:38,890
You were hamming it up as the tragic heroine.

9625
06:41:39,050 --> 06:41:41,670
Thanks to the script that the Patriots wrote...

9626
06:41:41,670 --> 06:41:42,090
for you.

9627
06:41:43,050 --> 06:41:44,890
Well what about free will exists?

9628
06:41:45,130 --> 06:41:45,910
Your self-indulgence...

9629
06:41:45,910 --> 06:41:48,110
absorbed in your own misfortune.

9630
06:41:48,290 --> 06:41:50,090
You couldn't get enough of the drama.

9631
06:41:50,510 --> 06:41:51,610
Bro, he's so mean.

9632
06:41:51,910 --> 06:41:54,150
I could have died whenever I wanted to.

9633
06:41:57,090 --> 06:41:57,650
Yeah.

9634
06:41:57,890 --> 06:41:58,830
I guess so.

9635
06:42:01,610 --> 06:42:03,590
Thought I got her in the heart.

9636
06:42:08,260 --> 06:42:09,580
Oh my god.

9637
06:42:09,880 --> 06:42:11,040
He's Lady Luck.

9638
06:42:11,080 --> 06:42:11,340
It missed.

9639
06:42:11,340 --> 06:42:12,880
Thanks Raiden.

9640
06:42:15,580 --> 06:42:17,260
Now I remember.

9641
06:42:18,200 --> 06:42:20,320
Your heart's on the right.

9642
06:42:23,780 --> 06:42:26,220
A blast of metal, my dear.

9643
06:42:26,520 --> 06:42:28,120
But your luck's run out.

9644
06:42:29,880 --> 06:42:31,900
This is the little gizmo.

9645
06:42:32,160 --> 06:42:35,260
There's no such thing as miracles or the supernatural.

9646
06:42:35,680 --> 06:42:37,240
Only cutting-edge technology.

9647
06:42:37,800 --> 06:42:38,980
Wait, then how did...

9648
06:42:38,980 --> 06:42:39,580
Oh!

9649
06:42:39,960 --> 06:42:40,240
Oh!

9650
06:42:40,260 --> 06:42:40,680
Oh!

9651
06:42:40,680 --> 06:42:41,320
Oh!

9652
06:42:41,320 --> 06:42:41,620
Oh my god.

9653
06:42:41,620 --> 06:42:41,980
My ears.

9654
06:42:42,160 --> 06:42:43,220
She didn't have that on.

9655
06:42:44,060 --> 06:42:44,780
Did she?

9656
06:42:44,860 --> 06:42:51,320
I can't prevent me from ascending.

9657
06:42:51,580 --> 06:42:52,860
What the heck then?

9658
06:42:53,080 --> 06:42:53,540
Oh no!

9659
06:42:53,720 --> 06:42:54,600
The Patriots!

9660
06:43:02,280 --> 06:43:03,620
Happy 4th of July!

9661
06:43:08,580 --> 06:43:09,560
Time to fight!

9662
06:43:09,840 --> 06:43:11,600
25 more raids!

9663
06:43:12,340 --> 06:43:12,580
Yippee!

9664
06:43:15,440 --> 06:43:17,240
Here's the real boss fight.

9665
06:43:17,460 --> 06:43:18,060
Oh my god.

9666
06:43:18,060 --> 06:43:18,160
Oh my god.

9667
06:43:21,990 --> 06:43:23,770
Remember the Alamo.

9668
06:43:26,830 --> 06:43:38,510
Now that I have enough data, all I have to do is retrieve Arsenal and clean up the refuse from the exercise.

9669
06:43:39,510 --> 06:43:40,350
Look out.

9670
06:43:40,370 --> 06:43:40,990
Look at his tail.

9671
06:43:41,090 --> 06:43:41,670
Just try.

9672
06:43:41,930 --> 06:43:42,990
Raiden's just so cute.

9673
06:43:49,410 --> 06:43:50,050
Yeah!

9674
06:43:51,150 --> 06:43:51,790
Oh!

9675
06:43:51,930 --> 06:43:52,570
Oh!

9676
06:43:52,570 --> 06:43:53,110
Oh!

9677
06:43:54,070 --> 06:43:54,430
Nice!

9678
06:43:55,730 --> 06:43:56,710
Good job.

9679
06:43:57,090 --> 06:43:57,610
Ah!

9680
06:43:57,890 --> 06:43:58,510
Ah!

9681
06:44:00,230 --> 06:44:02,170
Rules of nature!

9682
06:44:02,290 --> 06:44:03,170
That's how we learned it!

9683
06:44:03,310 --> 06:44:03,490
Wow!

9684
06:44:06,570 --> 06:44:08,590
I love Solidus's outfit.

9685
06:44:09,650 --> 06:44:11,090
So awesome...

9686
06:44:12,250 --> 06:44:12,970
Oh!

9687
06:44:13,230 --> 06:44:13,950
Fortune!

9688
06:44:15,550 --> 06:44:16,570
She stands!

9689
06:44:16,850 --> 06:44:17,590
She's still standing.

9690
06:44:17,890 --> 06:44:18,550
Okay!

9691
06:44:45,150 --> 06:44:47,110
Oh, my God.

9692
06:44:49,070 --> 06:44:51,610
Oh, my God.

9693
06:44:51,610 --> 06:44:53,790
Ray-sized arsenals or one arsenal-sized room.

9694
06:45:06,880 --> 06:45:08,820
She's so awesome.

9695
06:45:09,770 --> 06:45:11,620
She is Lady Luck.

9696
06:45:13,860 --> 06:45:14,640
I

9697
06:45:23,600 --> 06:45:25,340
love her so much.

9698
06:45:25,360 --> 06:45:26,380
She's so awesome.

9699
06:45:32,140 --> 06:45:33,700
We're done.

9700
06:45:34,200 --> 06:45:38,160
My name is Helena Dolph Jackson.

9701
06:45:38,160 --> 06:45:42,380
The daughter of a proud and noble soldier.

9702
06:45:47,090 --> 06:45:54,510
I can see my family... again.

9703
06:46:01,640 --> 06:46:03,120
So awesome.

9704
06:46:03,620 --> 06:46:04,280
Damn!

9705
06:46:04,480 --> 06:46:05,180
Damn!

9706
06:46:05,460 --> 06:46:09,500
So awesome.

9707
06:46:10,640 --> 06:46:12,360
Try this instead.

9708
06:46:16,740 --> 06:46:18,840
Try this on for size.

9709
06:46:19,800 --> 06:46:20,680
Uh-oh.

9710
06:46:21,400 --> 06:46:26,880
Oh, that pesky hand of his.

9711
06:46:44,300 --> 06:46:47,000
This game just never stops delivering.

9712
06:46:48,460 --> 06:46:50,580
It's one thing after another.

9713
06:46:50,580 --> 06:46:51,800
It truly is.

9714
06:46:54,410 --> 06:46:54,760
Brothers!

9715
06:46:57,580 --> 06:46:58,280
Liquid.

9716
06:46:58,500 --> 06:46:59,160
Liquid.

9717
06:47:05,120 --> 06:47:07,580
I've been waiting for this.

9718
06:47:07,700 --> 06:47:10,520
It can't be.

9719
06:47:11,360 --> 06:47:12,060
Liquid.

9720
06:47:13,900 --> 06:47:14,600
Brothers.

9721
06:47:15,440 --> 06:47:19,620
I've been inside this arm all along waiting for the right time to awaken.

9722
06:47:21,760 --> 06:47:24,000
Oh, I love this game so much.

9723
06:47:25,900 --> 06:47:27,960
You were inside Ocelot?

9724
06:47:28,480 --> 06:47:28,960
Yes.

9725
06:47:29,420 --> 06:47:31,460
A sleeper in the arm of a Patriot spy.

9726
06:47:32,100 --> 06:47:33,680
It was you two years ago?

9727
06:47:34,000 --> 06:47:34,480
Exactly.

9728
06:47:34,880 --> 06:47:35,880
I was controlling him.

9729
06:47:35,880 --> 06:47:37,020
I guess we know who tops.

9730
06:47:39,220 --> 06:47:41,600
Imagine doing an alpha strike on a 1HP in between.

9731
06:47:41,700 --> 06:47:42,460
It was like all your doing roles.

9732
06:47:42,460 --> 06:47:45,580
Snake, it was I that leaked information about Arsenal to your partner and got you out here.

9733
06:47:45,920 --> 06:47:46,400
What?

9734
06:47:46,940 --> 06:47:49,040
You're the only one that can free me.

9735
06:47:49,040 --> 06:47:50,300
After all...

9736
06:47:51,200 --> 06:47:52,140
After all?

9737
06:47:53,140 --> 06:47:54,100
Dramatic pause.

9738
06:47:56,560 --> 06:47:57,540
Dramatic pause?

9739
06:47:59,040 --> 06:48:01,480
I'm off to bury the Patriots for good.

9740
06:48:01,620 --> 06:48:03,080
You're drowning in time, brother.

9741
06:48:03,620 --> 06:48:03,640
You know who they are.

9742
06:48:03,640 --> 06:48:03,660
How?

9743
06:48:05,160 --> 06:48:08,120
Why do you think I chose Ocelot as my host?

9744
06:48:08,420 --> 06:48:09,480
That guy's crazy.

9745
06:48:09,720 --> 06:48:12,300
Before I go, I have a family matter to settle with both of you.

9746
06:48:13,180 --> 06:48:16,500
There's room for only one snake and one big boss.

9747
06:48:18,460 --> 06:48:19,020
Snake.

9748
06:48:22,920 --> 06:48:23,640
Did you get that?

9749
06:48:25,920 --> 06:48:26,280
Okay...

9750
06:48:26,920 --> 06:48:28,260
Don't let me run!

9751
06:48:28,620 --> 06:48:29,040
Just be carefull.

9752
06:48:29,800 --> 06:48:31,660
Shake it away!

9753
06:48:32,320 --> 06:48:45,370
Where are you going?!

9754
06:48:45,370 --> 06:48:47,990
I'm going to kill you.

9755
06:48:49,390 --> 06:48:50,110
You

9756
06:48:54,180 --> 06:48:55,960
Deep inside my head.

9757
06:49:04,010 --> 06:49:04,770
Whee!

9758
06:49:33,100 --> 06:49:34,720
McQueen, stop this thing!

9759
06:49:38,600 --> 06:49:40,700
Snake was on something this dark.

9760
06:49:41,020 --> 06:49:42,000
Oh no!

9761
06:49:42,980 --> 06:49:43,960
Oh no!

9762
06:49:45,000 --> 06:49:46,080
Oh my god!

9763
06:49:46,920 --> 06:49:49,060
We're gonna crash right into the city!

9764
06:49:52,640 --> 06:49:53,440
Arsenal!

9765
06:49:56,980 --> 06:49:58,220
Oh my gosh!

9766
06:50:04,480 --> 06:50:05,680
False alarm!

9767
06:50:17,890 --> 06:50:18,930
Like a glove.

9768
06:50:20,030 --> 06:50:21,590
That was so clean.

9769
06:50:22,210 --> 06:50:23,250
Now we're here!

9770
06:50:27,840 --> 06:50:30,520
Are you guys ready for even more info dump?

9771
06:50:31,340 --> 06:50:31,880
Let's go!

9772
06:50:33,540 --> 06:50:35,060
I have to go to this place.

9773
06:50:39,660 --> 06:50:41,240
I'm so happy we're at the end.

9774
06:50:41,400 --> 06:50:43,420
Oh my gosh, I love the ending of this game so much.

9775
06:50:44,980 --> 06:50:46,080
Hit me with it.

9776
06:50:48,840 --> 06:50:49,720
Federal hall?

9777
06:50:49,880 --> 06:50:50,240
Yes!

9778
06:50:51,500 --> 06:50:51,880
Federal hall!

9779
06:50:56,540 --> 06:51:01,180
What are you laughing at?

9780
06:51:02,840 --> 06:51:04,880
Do you know what day it is today?

9781
06:51:05,820 --> 06:51:06,920
April 30th?

9782
06:51:08,200 --> 06:51:09,640
April 30th?

9783
06:51:12,820 --> 06:51:13,540
Actually...

9784
06:51:13,540 --> 06:51:14,900
July 20th?

9785
06:51:15,020 --> 06:51:15,080
That's right.

9786
06:51:18,200 --> 06:51:23,840
George Washington took office as the first president of the United States of America 200 years ago.

9787
06:51:23,840 --> 06:51:24,240
Today.

9788
06:51:25,160 --> 06:51:25,680
Wow!

9789
06:51:25,920 --> 06:51:27,160
And it happened right here.

9790
06:51:27,340 --> 06:51:27,600
Wow!

9791
06:51:27,960 --> 06:51:30,000
We were going to declare another independence.

9792
06:51:30,440 --> 06:51:32,100
The dawn of a new nation.

9793
06:51:32,280 --> 06:51:32,760
Here.

9794
06:51:34,240 --> 06:51:36,500
The end of the Patriots' secret rule.

9795
06:51:37,160 --> 06:51:38,440
Liberation of this country.

9796
06:51:38,820 --> 06:51:41,140
This was where it was supposed to begin.

9797
06:51:41,700 --> 06:51:44,380
This is where freedom could have been born.

9798
06:51:52,340 --> 06:51:52,860
Yep.

9799
06:51:54,040 --> 06:51:54,560
Yep.

9800
06:51:55,180 --> 06:51:55,700
Born.

9801
06:51:55,700 --> 06:51:57,740
All you want is power at any cost.

9802
06:51:57,740 --> 06:51:58,480
Jack.

9803
06:51:58,480 --> 06:51:59,260
Sorry, I was checking a text.

9804
06:51:59,520 --> 06:52:01,240
It's not power I want.

9805
06:52:02,440 --> 06:52:08,020
What I wanted to take back from the Patriots are things like freedom, civil rights, opportunities.

9806
06:52:09,300 --> 06:52:11,620
The founding principles of this country.

9807
06:52:14,180 --> 06:52:17,600
Everything that's about to be wiped out by their digital censorship.

9808
06:52:20,440 --> 06:52:21,960
Jack, listen to me.

9809
06:52:22,680 --> 06:52:24,860
We're all born with an expiration date.

9810
06:52:24,860 --> 06:52:26,960
No one lasts forever.

9811
06:52:28,460 --> 06:52:34,400
Life is nothing but a grace period for turning the best of our genetic material into the next generation.

9812
06:52:38,280 --> 06:52:42,080
The data of life is transferred from parent to child.

9813
06:52:42,320 --> 06:52:42,960
What is that, water?

9814
06:52:43,500 --> 06:52:44,980
That's how it works.

9815
06:52:46,020 --> 06:52:48,720
But we have no heirs, no legacy.

9816
06:52:51,160 --> 06:52:54,160
We brothers are called Les Enfants Terribles.

9817
06:52:54,160 --> 06:52:54,500
Terrible.

9818
06:52:54,820 --> 06:52:55,400
Terrible.

9819
06:52:55,400 --> 06:53:00,440
Cloned from our father with the ability to reproduce conveniently engineered out.

9820
06:53:00,700 --> 06:53:00,980
Oof.

9821
06:53:01,480 --> 06:53:04,520
What is our legacy if we cannot pass the torch?

9822
06:53:05,740 --> 06:53:06,900
Your legacy is...

9823
06:53:06,900 --> 06:53:07,240
Proof of our existence.

9824
06:53:07,580 --> 06:53:09,320
A mark of some sort.

9825
06:53:09,460 --> 06:53:11,080
Is what you do with your time here.

9826
06:53:11,200 --> 06:53:12,580
You don't need to have children.

9827
06:53:12,880 --> 06:53:13,480
It's okay.

9828
06:53:13,920 --> 06:53:19,420
When the torch is passed on from parent to child, it extends beyond DNA.

9829
06:53:19,760 --> 06:53:21,600
Information is imparted as well.

9830
06:53:23,320 --> 06:53:25,360
Spade or neuter your snakes.

9831
06:53:27,740 --> 06:53:29,660
They have... wait...

9832
06:53:29,660 --> 06:53:32,840
Did they also take Ryden's people?

9833
06:53:33,360 --> 06:53:34,080
By history.

9834
06:53:34,440 --> 06:53:35,680
He was a Kandar.

9835
06:53:35,740 --> 06:53:41,940
The Patriots are trying to protect their power, their own interests, by controlling the digital flow of information.

9836
06:53:42,380 --> 06:53:45,600
I want my memory, my existence to remain.

9837
06:53:45,920 --> 06:53:50,560
Unlike an intron of history, I will be remembered as an Exon.

9838
06:53:51,600 --> 06:53:52,560
That will be my legacy.

9839
06:53:52,780 --> 06:53:54,300
My mark in history.

9840
06:53:54,540 --> 06:53:55,460
Okay, crazy pants.

9841
06:53:55,900 --> 06:53:58,260
But the Patriots will deny us even that.

9842
06:54:00,080 --> 06:54:01,940
I will triumph over the Patriots.

9843
06:54:01,940 --> 06:54:03,300
Yeah, he did get Rose pregnant.

9844
06:54:03,580 --> 06:54:04,620
And liberate us all.

9845
06:54:04,740 --> 06:54:04,900
Pregante.

9846
06:54:05,200 --> 06:54:06,800
And we will become...

9847
06:54:07,480 --> 06:54:09,200
The Sons of Liberty!

9848
06:54:09,740 --> 06:54:10,180
Yeah!

9849
06:54:13,860 --> 06:54:14,980
Tidal drop, baby!

9850
06:54:18,060 --> 06:54:19,460
Ryden, are you receiving?

9851
06:54:19,820 --> 06:54:21,160
We're still here.

9852
06:54:21,160 --> 06:54:23,340
I don't want to talk to you, creepy colonel.

9853
06:54:23,400 --> 06:54:24,500
The AI was destroyed.

9854
06:54:24,560 --> 06:54:25,940
I don't want to talk to you, creepy colonel.

9855
06:54:26,020 --> 06:54:26,740
Only GWs.

9856
06:54:26,740 --> 06:54:27,720
Who are you?

9857
06:54:27,980 --> 06:54:31,700
To begin with, we're not what you'd call human.

9858
06:54:33,120 --> 06:54:39,020
Over the past 200 years, a kind of consciousness formed layer by layer in the crucible of the White House.

9859
06:54:39,520 --> 06:54:44,080
It's not unlike the way life started in the oceans 4 billion years ago.

9860
06:54:44,320 --> 06:54:46,700
The White House was our primordial soup.

9861
06:54:47,420 --> 06:54:48,460
Primordial soup!

9862
06:54:49,960 --> 06:54:51,000
Good soup.

9863
06:54:51,000 --> 06:54:55,440
We are the very discipline and morality that Americans invoke so often.

9864
06:54:55,700 --> 06:54:58,100
How can anyone hope to eliminate us?

9865
06:54:58,320 --> 06:55:01,740
As long as this nation exists, so will we.

9866
06:55:01,960 --> 06:55:02,880
Cut the crap!

9867
06:55:03,100 --> 06:55:08,100
If you're immortal, why would you take away individual freedoms and censor the net?

9868
06:55:08,360 --> 06:55:09,320
The net?

9869
06:55:09,580 --> 06:55:12,160
Jack, don't be so despicable.

9870
06:55:12,220 --> 06:55:16,040
Don't you know that our plans have your interests, not ours, in mind?

9871
06:55:16,380 --> 06:55:16,820
What?

9872
06:55:17,000 --> 06:55:19,020
Jack, listen carefully.

9873
06:55:19,180 --> 06:55:20,380
Like a good boy.

9874
06:55:20,380 --> 06:55:21,000
Rose?

9875
06:55:21,240 --> 06:55:24,260
The mapping of the human genome was completed early this century.

9876
06:55:24,540 --> 06:55:29,340
As a result, the evolutionary log of the human race lay open to us.

9877
06:55:29,600 --> 06:55:35,680
We started with genetic engineering, and in the end, we succeeded in digitizing life itself.

9878
06:55:36,080 --> 06:55:36,460
Despicable.

9879
06:55:36,460 --> 06:55:38,840
But there are things not covered by genetic information.

9880
06:55:39,300 --> 06:55:40,400
What do you mean?

9881
06:55:40,540 --> 06:55:41,040
What do you mean?

9882
06:55:41,140 --> 06:55:44,800
Human memories, ideas, culture, history.

9883
06:55:45,500 --> 06:55:48,420
Genes don't contain any record of human history.

9884
06:55:48,480 --> 06:55:48,980
They don't.

9885
06:55:48,980 --> 06:55:50,980
Is it something that should not be passed on?

9886
06:55:51,100 --> 06:55:53,900
Should that information be left at the mercy of nature?

9887
06:55:54,300 --> 06:55:56,700
We've always kept records of our lives.

9888
06:55:56,900 --> 06:56:01,560
Through words, pictures, symbols, from tablets to books.

9889
06:56:01,960 --> 06:56:05,360
But not all the information was inherited by later generations.

9890
06:56:05,860 --> 06:56:10,240
A small percentage of the whole was selected and processed, then passed on.

9891
06:56:10,240 --> 06:56:11,160
They're gonna see my books.

9892
06:56:11,160 --> 06:56:12,560
Not unlike genes, really.

9893
06:56:12,860 --> 06:56:14,600
That's what history is, Jack.

9894
06:56:14,920 --> 06:56:17,160
But in the current digitized world...

9895
06:56:17,160 --> 06:56:17,900
They're gonna see all my books.

9896
06:56:17,900 --> 06:56:20,100
The trivial information is accumulating every second.

9897
06:56:20,540 --> 06:56:22,500
Preserved in all its triteness.

9898
06:56:22,680 --> 06:56:23,880
Never fading.

9899
06:56:24,140 --> 06:56:25,360
Always accessible.

9900
06:56:26,020 --> 06:56:29,900
Rumors about petty issues, misinterpretations, slander.

9901
06:56:30,120 --> 06:56:30,700
Slander?

9902
06:56:30,860 --> 06:56:32,100
Wait, what about libel?

9903
06:56:32,280 --> 06:56:36,280
Preserved in an unfiltered state, growing at an alarming rate.

9904
06:56:36,480 --> 06:56:38,860
It will only slow down social progress.

9905
06:56:39,060 --> 06:56:40,460
Reduce the rate of evolution.

9906
06:56:40,960 --> 06:56:41,520
Right.

9907
06:56:41,660 --> 06:56:44,300
You seem to think that our plan is one of censorship.

9908
06:56:44,820 --> 06:56:46,180
Are you telling me it's not?

9909
06:56:46,460 --> 06:56:47,620
You're being silly.

9910
06:56:47,620 --> 06:56:48,160
Silly.

9911
06:56:48,300 --> 06:56:52,540
What we propose to do is not to control content, but to create context.

9912
06:56:52,900 --> 06:56:54,380
Create context?

9913
06:56:54,880 --> 06:57:02,260
The digital society furthers human flaws and selectively rewards development of convenient half-truths.

9914
06:57:02,260 --> 06:57:06,240
Just look at the strange juxtapositions of morality around you.

9915
06:57:06,460 --> 06:57:06,980
The music is crazy.

9916
06:57:06,980 --> 06:57:11,020
Billions spent on new weapons in order to humanely murder other humans.

9917
06:57:11,420 --> 06:57:15,540
Rights of criminals are given more respect than the privacy of their victims.

9918
06:57:15,540 --> 06:57:21,540
Although there are people suffering in poverty, huge donations are made to protect endangered species.

9919
06:57:22,060 --> 06:57:24,600
Everyone grows up being told the same thing.

9920
06:57:25,120 --> 06:57:26,640
Be nice to other people.

9921
06:57:27,000 --> 06:57:28,520
But beat out the competition.

9922
06:57:29,000 --> 06:57:30,080
You're special.

9923
06:57:30,400 --> 06:57:32,620
Believe in yourself and you will succeed.

9924
06:57:33,060 --> 06:57:36,400
But it's obvious from the start that only a few can succeed.

9925
06:57:36,720 --> 06:57:41,080
You exercise your right to freedom, and this is the result.

9926
06:57:41,380 --> 06:57:45,520
All rhetoric to avoid conflict and protect each other from harm.

9927
06:57:45,540 --> 06:57:55,500
The untested truths, spun by different interests, continue to churn and accumulate in the sandbox of political correctness and value systems.

9928
06:57:55,880 --> 06:58:00,720
Everyone withdraws into their own small gated community afraid of a larger forum.

9929
06:58:00,980 --> 06:58:08,400
They stay inside their little ponds, leaking whatever truth suits them into the growing cesspool of society at large.

9930
06:58:08,780 --> 06:58:10,100
Cesspool of society.

9931
06:58:10,280 --> 06:58:12,240
The different cardinal truths neither clash nor mesh.

9932
06:58:12,520 --> 06:58:14,120
No one is invalidated.

9933
06:58:14,120 --> 06:58:15,700
But nobody is right.

9934
06:58:15,960 --> 06:58:18,840
Not even natural selection can take place here.

9935
06:58:19,000 --> 06:58:21,380
The world is being engulfed in truth.

9936
06:58:21,700 --> 06:58:23,800
And this is the way the world ends.

9937
06:58:24,180 --> 06:58:26,500
Not with a bang, but a whimper.

9938
06:58:26,740 --> 06:58:28,940
We're trying to stop that from happening.

9939
06:58:29,200 --> 06:58:31,620
It's our responsibility as rulers.

9940
06:58:32,040 --> 06:58:40,420
Just as in genetics, unnecessary information and memory must be filtered out to stimulate the evolution of the species.

9941
06:58:40,420 --> 06:58:41,080
This game is too crazy.

9942
06:58:41,260 --> 06:58:43,940
And you think you're qualified to decide what's necessary?

9943
06:58:44,120 --> 06:58:45,780
They're aware of Twitter.

9944
06:58:46,380 --> 06:58:48,620
The patriots go on Twitter.com.

9945
06:58:48,620 --> 06:58:55,400
Who else could wade through the sea of garbage you people produce, retrieve valuable truths, and even interpret their meaning for later generations?

9946
06:58:55,940 --> 06:58:58,280
That's what it means to create context.

9947
06:58:58,840 --> 06:59:02,400
I'll decide for myself what to believe and what to pass on.

9948
06:59:02,620 --> 06:59:04,780
But is that even your own idea?

9949
06:59:05,120 --> 06:59:06,960
Or something Snake told you?

9950
06:59:08,580 --> 06:59:11,120
That's the proof of your incompetence right there.

9951
06:59:11,300 --> 06:59:14,100
You lack the qualifications to exercise your power.

9952
06:59:14,860 --> 06:59:16,840
He gave up so quickly.

9953
06:59:17,500 --> 06:59:20,900
Does something like a self exist inside of you?

9954
06:59:21,300 --> 06:59:25,200
That which you call self serves as nothing more than a mask to cover your own being.

9955
06:59:25,200 --> 06:59:25,320
The sigh.

9956
06:59:25,600 --> 06:59:26,520
He just gave up.

9957
06:59:26,760 --> 06:59:27,740
Come on, Ryan.

9958
06:59:28,100 --> 06:59:34,700
In this era of ready-made truths, self is just something used to preserve those positive emotions that you occasionally feel.

9959
06:59:35,000 --> 06:59:43,180
Another possibility is that self is a concept you conveniently borrowed under the logic that would endow you with some sense of strength.

9960
06:59:44,100 --> 06:59:44,420
That's crap.

9961
06:59:44,880 --> 06:59:45,500
That's crap.

9962
06:59:45,820 --> 06:59:45,980
Is it?

9963
06:59:45,980 --> 06:59:48,020
Would you prefer that someone else tell you?

9964
06:59:48,240 --> 06:59:49,380
All right, then.

9965
06:59:49,800 --> 06:59:51,100
Explain it to him.

9966
06:59:51,460 --> 06:59:53,580
Jack, you're simply the best.

9967
06:59:53,860 --> 06:59:56,640
And you got there all by yourself.

9968
07:00:00,020 --> 07:00:01,140
What happened?

9969
07:00:01,300 --> 07:00:02,540
Do you feel lost?

9970
07:00:02,940 --> 07:00:05,040
Why not try a bit of soul-searching?

9971
07:00:05,240 --> 07:00:05,540
Maybe.

9972
07:00:05,760 --> 07:00:07,420
Don't think you'll find anything, though.

9973
07:00:08,300 --> 07:00:11,680
Ironically, that all those self is something that you yourself fashion.

9974
07:00:11,680 --> 07:00:17,320
Every time something goes wrong, you turn around and place the blame on something else.

9975
07:00:17,620 --> 07:00:18,960
It's not my fault.

9976
07:00:19,060 --> 07:00:20,580
It's not your fault.

9977
07:00:20,920 --> 07:00:28,480
In denial, you simply resort to looking for another, more convenient truth in order to make yourself feel better.

9978
07:00:28,840 --> 07:00:32,980
Leaving behind in an instant the so-called truth you once embraced.

9979
07:00:33,460 --> 07:00:37,080
Should someone like that be able to decide what is truth?

9980
07:00:37,460 --> 07:00:40,660
Should someone like you even have the right to decide?

9981
07:00:40,660 --> 07:00:43,260
You've done nothing but abuse your freedom.

9982
07:00:43,640 --> 07:00:45,540
You don't deserve to be free.

9983
07:00:45,840 --> 07:00:47,840
We're not the ones smothering the world.

9984
07:00:48,160 --> 07:00:49,060
You are.

9985
07:00:49,080 --> 07:00:50,300
It's on you, Raiden.

9986
07:00:50,440 --> 07:00:53,420
The individual is supposed to be weak, but far from powerless.

9987
07:00:53,700 --> 07:00:56,840
A single person has the potential to ruin the world.

9988
07:00:57,080 --> 07:01:02,080
And the age of digitized communication has given even more power to the individual.

9989
07:01:02,340 --> 07:01:05,180
Too much power for an immature species.

9990
07:01:05,800 --> 07:01:10,580
Building a legacy involves figuring out what is wanted and what needs to be done.

9991
07:01:10,660 --> 07:01:13,800
All this you used to struggle with.

9992
07:01:13,980 --> 07:01:15,840
Now, we think for you.

9993
07:01:16,040 --> 07:01:16,980
You know what?

9994
07:01:17,480 --> 07:01:18,740
Sounds kinda nice.

9995
07:01:19,060 --> 07:01:20,960
You want to control human thought?

9996
07:01:21,040 --> 07:01:22,380
Human behavior?

9997
07:01:22,900 --> 07:01:23,820
Of course.

9998
07:01:24,460 --> 07:01:26,680
Anything can be quantified nowadays.

9999
07:01:27,500 --> 07:01:30,380
That's what this exercise was designed to prove.

10000
07:01:30,580 --> 07:01:33,760
You fell in love with me just as you were meant to, after all.

10001
07:01:34,100 --> 07:01:35,240
Isn't that right, Jack?

10002
07:01:35,860 --> 07:01:39,280
Ocelot was not told the whole truth, to say the least.

10003
07:01:40,660 --> 07:01:41,560
We are an entire nation.

10004
07:01:41,740 --> 07:01:46,300
Of what interest would a single soldier, no matter how able, be to us?

10005
07:01:46,580 --> 07:01:50,660
The S3 plan does not stand for Solid Snake Simulation.

10006
07:01:50,940 --> 07:01:55,840
What it does stand for is Selection for Societal Sanity.

10007
07:01:59,440 --> 07:02:01,160
My sanity is gone!

10008
07:02:01,200 --> 07:02:03,560
The S3 is a system for controlling human will and consciousness.

10009
07:02:05,980 --> 07:02:08,620
What AI Summarizer says for the stream is, I agree.

10010
07:02:11,140 --> 07:02:11,980
What just happened?

10011
07:02:12,240 --> 07:02:14,680
Soldiers are trained in the image of Solid Snake.

10012
07:02:14,960 --> 07:02:16,060
Well, that scared me for a second.

10013
07:02:17,320 --> 07:02:22,300
It is a method, a protocol that created a circumstance that made you what you are.

10014
07:02:24,360 --> 07:02:26,340
So you see, we're the S3.

10015
07:02:27,060 --> 07:02:27,820
Not you.

10016
07:02:34,410 --> 07:02:36,490
The game is screwing with you, for real.

10017
07:02:36,570 --> 07:02:39,110
That was getting too meta, too meta!

10018
07:02:41,030 --> 07:02:41,810
That's crazy.

10019
07:02:42,250 --> 07:02:44,310
You heard what President Johnson said.

10020
07:02:45,290 --> 07:02:48,250
The Arsenal's GW system is the key to their supremacy.

10021
07:02:48,590 --> 07:02:52,770
The objective of this exercise was to establish such a method.

10022
07:02:56,290 --> 07:02:57,870
The difference between submission and rebellion.

10023
07:02:57,870 --> 07:02:59,790
We used Shadow Moses as a paradigm for the exercise.

10024
07:03:01,350 --> 07:03:04,550
I wonder if you would have preferred a fantasy setting.

10025
07:03:04,990 --> 07:03:06,890
Ooh, with elf girls.

10026
07:03:07,810 --> 07:03:11,310
We chose that back thought because of its extreme circumstances.

10027
07:03:11,330 --> 07:03:12,210
Sorry, the hack.

10028
07:03:12,210 --> 07:03:15,250
It was an optimal test for S3's crisis management capacity.

10029
07:03:15,250 --> 07:03:21,110
If the model could trigger, control, and solve this, it would be ready for any contingency.

10030
07:03:21,310 --> 07:03:22,270
Snake is so awesome.

10031
07:03:22,610 --> 07:03:23,830
And now we have our proof.

10032
07:03:24,110 --> 07:03:24,710
I did all that.

10033
07:03:29,690 --> 07:03:32,330
Fantasy Metal Gear would just literally be Bloodborne.

10034
07:03:32,330 --> 07:03:32,350
Right.

10035
07:03:32,350 --> 07:03:34,510
There are also reasons behind your selection.

10036
07:03:35,270 --> 07:03:37,690
Solidus raised plenty of other child soldiers.

10037
07:03:38,050 --> 07:03:38,510
Or Lake Elden Ring.

10038
07:03:38,510 --> 07:03:40,590
You know why we chose you over them?

10039
07:03:41,050 --> 07:03:41,390
Hmm.

10040
07:03:41,390 --> 07:03:45,930
It was because you were the only one who refused to acknowledge the past.

10041
07:03:46,350 --> 07:03:50,270
All the others remember what they were and pay for it daily.

10042
07:03:50,630 --> 07:03:53,590
But you turn your back on everything you don't like.

10043
07:03:53,670 --> 07:03:55,330
You do whatever you like.

10044
07:03:55,370 --> 07:03:57,150
See only the things you like.

10045
07:03:57,270 --> 07:03:58,490
And for yourself alone.

10046
07:03:58,690 --> 07:03:59,190
What's wrong with that?

10047
07:04:00,010 --> 07:04:02,730
If I don't like it, why do I have to deal with it?

10048
07:04:02,830 --> 07:04:04,150
You refused to see me for what I was.

10049
07:04:04,410 --> 07:04:05,850
I lied to you.

10050
07:04:05,950 --> 07:04:07,490
But I wanted to be caught.

10051
07:04:07,710 --> 07:04:09,570
You pretended to be understanding.

10052
07:04:09,950 --> 07:04:11,010
To be a gentleman.

10053
07:04:11,010 --> 07:04:14,290
You never made a conscious attempt to reach out to me.

10054
07:04:14,370 --> 07:04:17,950
The only time you did was when I gave you no choice but to do so.

10055
07:04:18,490 --> 07:04:19,870
I was just trying not to.

10056
07:04:20,650 --> 07:04:21,090
What?

10057
07:04:21,090 --> 07:04:22,390
Trying not to hurt me?

10058
07:04:22,750 --> 07:04:25,590
Dear, the one you were trying not to hurt was yourself.

10059
07:04:26,270 --> 07:04:29,430
Avoiding the truth under the guise of kindness is all that you did.

10060
07:04:29,670 --> 07:04:32,190
It occurred to you to do nothing but look out for yourself.

10061
07:04:32,750 --> 07:04:36,770
Even if you claimed that it was for my sake, that feeling was nowhere to be seen.

10062
07:04:36,950 --> 07:04:39,650
In the end, everything was for your sake.

10063
07:04:39,650 --> 07:04:41,290
I was never part of the picture.

10064
07:04:41,290 --> 07:04:41,870
Raiden, are you okay?

10065
07:04:43,970 --> 07:04:44,990
Exactly right.

10066
07:04:44,990 --> 07:04:46,130
Why is the AI laughing?

10067
07:04:46,210 --> 07:04:46,990
It's creepy.

10068
07:04:47,670 --> 07:04:50,790
You are a perfect representative of the masses we need to protect.

10069
07:04:50,950 --> 07:04:52,690
Why is the AI laughing?

10070
07:04:52,750 --> 07:04:54,930
Why does it have emotions like that?

10071
07:04:55,190 --> 07:05:00,290
You accepted the fiction we've provided, obeyed our orders, and did everything you were told to.

10072
07:05:00,610 --> 07:05:03,350
The exercise is a resounding success.

10073
07:05:03,810 --> 07:05:05,170
The snake actually over there in the oil rig?

10074
07:05:05,190 --> 07:05:06,250
Did you not tell me the GW was still incomplete?

10075
07:05:06,670 --> 07:05:08,750
But not anymore, thanks to you.

10076
07:05:08,750 --> 07:05:15,510
Your persona, experiences, triumphs, and defeats are nothing but byproducts.

10077
07:05:15,510 --> 07:05:20,050
The real objective was ensuring that we could generate and manipulate them.

10078
07:05:20,330 --> 07:05:25,390
It's taken a lot of time and money, but it was well worth it considering the results.

10079
07:05:26,510 --> 07:05:28,590
I think that's enough talk.

10080
07:05:28,930 --> 07:05:31,030
It's time for the final exercise.

10081
07:05:31,810 --> 07:05:34,250
Raiden, take Solidus down.

10082
07:05:34,650 --> 07:05:35,590
Think again.

10083
07:05:35,870 --> 07:05:38,210
I'm through doing what I'm told.

10084
07:05:38,750 --> 07:05:39,430
Oh really?

10085
07:05:39,910 --> 07:05:41,570
Aren't you forgetting something?

10086
07:05:41,970 --> 07:05:44,510
If you die, my child dies.

10087
07:05:45,170 --> 07:05:50,330
Determination of vital signals from your nanomachines means the death of Olga's child.

10088
07:05:50,630 --> 07:05:53,370
Not to mention the death of Rose.

10089
07:05:53,790 --> 07:05:55,690
She's wired the same way.

10090
07:05:55,810 --> 07:05:55,990
What?

10091
07:05:56,450 --> 07:05:58,590
Rose, does she actually exist?

10092
07:05:59,270 --> 07:06:00,470
Of course I do, Jack.

10093
07:06:00,750 --> 07:06:02,470
You have to believe me.

10094
07:06:03,010 --> 07:06:04,010
Belive me?

10095
07:06:04,310 --> 07:06:05,850
Before you are dying to the death.

10096
07:06:06,370 --> 07:06:08,310
Solidus at least wants you dead.

10097
07:06:08,750 --> 07:06:11,790
We will collect the necessary data for this last fight.

10098
07:06:11,890 --> 07:06:11,950
Believe me.

10099
07:06:12,210 --> 07:06:14,430
Then we'll consider the exercise closed.

10100
07:06:14,890 --> 07:06:17,270
So, Jack the Ripper.

10101
07:06:17,410 --> 07:06:18,030
Jack the Ripper.

10102
07:06:18,030 --> 07:06:20,450
Will it be Solidus, the Patriot's creation?

10103
07:06:20,730 --> 07:06:23,570
Or you, Solidus' creation?

10104
07:06:24,610 --> 07:06:28,750
Our beloved monsters, enjoy yourselves.

10105
07:06:29,390 --> 07:06:30,970
Oh god!

10106
07:06:32,370 --> 07:06:33,010
Chills!

10107
07:06:33,190 --> 07:06:36,170
The last line is just so...

10108
07:06:36,170 --> 07:06:38,270
Oh my god!

10109
07:06:39,130 --> 07:06:40,130
Jack, my son.

10110
07:06:42,530 --> 07:06:45,290
My clone brothers and I are called monsters.

10111
07:06:45,850 --> 07:06:47,270
Replicates of evil genes.

10112
07:06:47,430 --> 07:06:48,930
Our beloved monsters.

10113
07:06:49,170 --> 07:06:51,970
You are one of a kind, but still a monster.

10114
07:06:52,090 --> 07:06:54,210
Shaped by a dark and secret history.

10115
07:06:56,030 --> 07:07:00,290
We need to decide which monstrosity will have the privilege of survival.

10116
07:07:04,650 --> 07:07:05,930
By the way, Jack.

10117
07:07:06,150 --> 07:07:07,490
This part is so funny.

10118
07:07:07,730 --> 07:07:10,050
I was the one who killed your parents.

10119
07:07:12,110 --> 07:07:13,030
Why you...

10120
07:07:13,030 --> 07:07:14,190
By the way, man.

10121
07:07:17,310 --> 07:07:21,550
I claimed you for my own and raised you as a soldier in the army of the devil.

10122
07:07:22,670 --> 07:07:25,810
I am your foster father and your worst enemy.

10123
07:07:26,030 --> 07:07:27,450
The timing is crazy.

10124
07:07:27,470 --> 07:07:30,470
Because I needed to know whether we were really someone else's creation.

10125
07:07:31,670 --> 07:07:33,610
We're repeating history, Jack.

10126
07:07:33,990 --> 07:07:36,350
Liquid and Solid hunted down Big Boss.

10127
07:07:36,350 --> 07:07:39,110
Trying to sever the tie that bound them to him.

10128
07:07:39,190 --> 07:07:42,250
Unless you kill me and face your past, Jack.

10129
07:07:42,510 --> 07:07:42,750
Big Boss.

10130
07:07:42,750 --> 07:07:44,110
You will never escape.

10131
07:07:44,430 --> 07:07:46,470
You'll stay in the endless loop.

10132
07:07:46,750 --> 07:07:48,710
Your own double helix.

10133
07:07:48,950 --> 07:07:49,650
Little baby.

10134
07:07:49,930 --> 07:07:50,950
Looks just like Paws.

10135
07:07:56,410 --> 07:07:58,310
It's time we were both free.

10136
07:08:02,610 --> 07:08:03,850
My hands!

10137
07:08:05,410 --> 07:08:06,650
I'm free!

10138
07:08:09,130 --> 07:08:10,390
Here we go, everybody.

10139
07:08:12,550 --> 07:08:13,990
Final boss fight.

10140
07:08:15,110 --> 07:08:16,070
Let's do this.

10141
07:08:16,790 --> 07:08:17,710
No guns.

10142
07:08:17,710 --> 07:08:19,310
I have other reasons for wanting you.

10143
07:08:19,350 --> 07:08:19,950
Actually, I don't remember.

10144
07:08:20,090 --> 07:08:21,790
I don't think I can use guns in this game.

10145
07:08:22,290 --> 07:08:25,370
The clues to the Patriots inside GW have been erased.

10146
07:08:25,610 --> 07:08:27,130
But there are other traces.

10147
07:08:30,130 --> 07:08:31,090
Inside you.

10148
07:08:31,370 --> 07:08:31,850
What?

10149
07:08:32,930 --> 07:08:36,770
The information is being carried by the nanomachines in your cerebral cortex.

10150
07:08:36,770 --> 07:08:39,250
And throughout the neural network, they fool you.

10151
07:08:39,250 --> 07:08:40,090
I forgot about...

10152
07:08:41,430 --> 07:08:42,470
What the...

10153
07:08:42,470 --> 07:08:43,210
That's crazy.

10154
07:08:46,390 --> 07:08:48,530
Why do you get two swords?

10155
07:08:53,890 --> 07:08:55,050
Here we go.

10156
07:08:55,570 --> 07:08:55,970
Brace yourself.

10157
07:09:03,170 --> 07:09:05,130
I don't remember how to fight.

10158
07:09:06,830 --> 07:09:07,450
What?

10159
07:09:08,570 --> 07:09:09,190
Oh.

10160
07:09:13,970 --> 07:09:14,830
Oh, shoot!

10161
07:09:15,810 --> 07:09:16,330
Oh!

10162
07:09:16,810 --> 07:09:17,550
Oh my God!

10163
07:09:20,790 --> 07:09:22,790
Okay, I have a body armor.

10164
07:09:23,090 --> 07:09:24,150
What else do I have?

10165
07:09:25,270 --> 07:09:25,790
Nothing.

10166
07:09:26,030 --> 07:09:26,350
Okay.

10167
07:09:26,850 --> 07:09:28,690
I have my dog tags.

10168
07:09:29,190 --> 07:09:30,690
And one ration.

10169
07:09:30,830 --> 07:09:34,690
And I can become a Grulukovich soldier.

10170
07:09:35,090 --> 07:09:37,150
Why did they give me that, of all things?

10171
07:09:55,460 --> 07:09:56,400
That's how I fight.

10172
07:09:56,500 --> 07:09:56,840
That's right.

10173
07:09:56,940 --> 07:09:57,600
That's how I fight.

10174
07:09:57,940 --> 07:09:58,760
I remembered.

10175
07:09:58,780 --> 07:09:58,900
I remember.

10176
07:09:58,900 --> 07:09:59,000
Here we are now.

10177
07:09:59,340 --> 07:09:59,980
Stabby Stab!

10178
07:10:00,840 --> 07:10:01,540
I'm on fire!

10179
07:10:20,810 --> 07:10:21,890
There's an additional ration?

10180
07:10:22,150 --> 07:10:22,710
Oh there is?

10181
07:10:22,970 --> 07:10:23,750
On the edge?

10182
07:10:23,970 --> 07:10:24,730
Oh I see it!

10183
07:10:26,230 --> 07:10:26,630
Ouch!

10184
07:10:26,870 --> 07:10:27,950
What's wrong with you?

10185
07:10:29,650 --> 07:10:30,390
Oh my god!

10186
07:10:32,790 --> 07:10:35,650
I don't remember how... I think I beat this last time in one try.

10187
07:10:35,890 --> 07:10:37,430
I don't remember how the hell I did that.

10188
07:10:38,870 --> 07:10:39,410
Come on!

10189
07:10:39,450 --> 07:10:39,750
Get up!

10190
07:10:40,010 --> 07:10:40,590
Get up!

10191
07:10:55,220 --> 07:10:56,660
Probably by hitting him.

10192
07:10:56,660 --> 07:10:57,240
Probably.

10193
07:10:59,000 --> 07:10:59,720
Oh shoot!

10194
07:11:00,400 --> 07:11:01,540
What's wrong with you?

10195
07:11:13,430 --> 07:11:14,150
Oh my god!

10196
07:11:14,250 --> 07:11:15,370
Why can't I hit him?

10197
07:11:16,130 --> 07:11:16,850
I'm dumb.

10198
07:11:17,250 --> 07:11:17,870
That's why.

10199
07:11:18,290 --> 07:11:19,690
I'm dumb dad!

10200
07:11:19,790 --> 07:11:20,910
You gave me gunpowder!

10201
07:11:23,650 --> 07:11:25,030
You gave me gunpowder!

10202
07:11:25,050 --> 07:11:26,290
Why can't I get a hit in ever?

10203
07:11:27,370 --> 07:11:28,190
Oh my god.

10204
07:11:51,200 --> 07:11:52,920
Or I can block like that.

10205
07:11:53,860 --> 07:11:54,300
Nice.

10206
07:12:02,780 --> 07:12:03,220
Oh!

10207
07:12:03,880 --> 07:12:05,380
Is that the best you can do?

10208
07:12:09,980 --> 07:12:12,060
Is that the best you can do?

10209
07:12:12,640 --> 07:12:13,320
Is that the best you can do?

10210
07:12:13,800 --> 07:12:14,320
Is that the best you can do?

10211
07:12:14,320 --> 07:12:14,720
Oh my god.

10212
07:12:14,740 --> 07:12:17,060
It's so janky.

10213
07:12:17,500 --> 07:12:18,480
Oh my god.

10214
07:12:19,040 --> 07:12:21,580
This sword is so janky.

10215
07:12:21,580 --> 07:12:22,280
Oh my god!

10216
07:12:23,740 --> 07:12:24,260
Sweep!

10217
07:12:29,480 --> 07:12:30,000
Sweep!

10218
07:12:57,780 --> 07:13:01,480
I'm trying to get his right side since that's where he has the...

10219
07:13:03,640 --> 07:13:04,360
The eye.

10220
07:13:04,440 --> 07:13:04,600
Oh!

10221
07:13:14,640 --> 07:13:15,700
You have to keep it tight.

10222
07:13:15,780 --> 07:13:15,820
You have to keep it tight.

10223
07:13:15,820 --> 07:13:16,180
I'm trying!

10224
07:13:19,260 --> 07:13:20,880
It's fun to hear him laughing though.

10225
07:13:25,300 --> 07:13:25,700
It's fun to hear him laughing though.

10226
07:13:25,700 --> 07:13:26,200
What can I say?

10227
07:13:26,940 --> 07:13:29,580
I'm not a weeb like everybody else.

10228
07:13:29,860 --> 07:13:30,060
I'm not a weeb like everybody else.

10229
07:13:30,400 --> 07:13:32,320
I think I got the most hits by...

10230
07:13:32,320 --> 07:13:32,400
I think I got the most hits by...

10231
07:13:33,900 --> 07:13:34,700
Oh shit!

10232
07:13:34,920 --> 07:13:35,980
Forgot to do L1.

10233
07:13:38,740 --> 07:13:39,400
Oh nice!

10234
07:13:39,400 --> 07:13:40,020
Oh!

10235
07:13:40,200 --> 07:13:43,480
Oh shoot!

10236
07:14:01,940 --> 07:14:02,840
Oh shoot!

10237
07:14:03,080 --> 07:14:03,540
Oh shoot!

10238
07:14:09,220 --> 07:14:10,020
There we go!

10239
07:14:10,880 --> 07:14:11,340
Yahoo!

10240
07:14:11,800 --> 07:14:12,260
No!

10241
07:14:14,120 --> 07:14:15,100
What the hell?

10242
07:14:15,180 --> 07:14:15,520
Oh!

10243
07:14:15,560 --> 07:14:16,080
That's right!

10244
07:14:16,300 --> 07:14:16,900
I can hold...

10245
07:14:16,900 --> 07:14:18,240
I can hold L1, right?

10246
07:14:21,140 --> 07:14:21,800
Oh my god.

10247
07:14:21,840 --> 07:14:23,380
I just end up turning around.

10248
07:14:23,760 --> 07:14:24,460
It's so funny.

10249
07:14:25,860 --> 07:14:26,320
Shoot!

10250
07:14:52,280 --> 07:14:52,640
Oh shoot!

10251
07:14:52,700 --> 07:14:53,440
I missed my chance again.

10252
07:14:54,940 --> 07:14:55,340
Oh!

10253
07:14:55,460 --> 07:14:56,060
I got him!

10254
07:15:10,460 --> 07:15:10,860
Yeah!

10255
07:15:10,900 --> 07:15:12,060
I'm the one who's hitting you though.

10256
07:15:12,240 --> 07:15:12,340
Woo!

10257
07:15:26,960 --> 07:15:27,360
Hey!

10258
07:15:27,780 --> 07:15:28,860
The sword is...

10259
07:15:28,860 --> 07:15:29,380
Oh my god!

10260
07:15:29,440 --> 07:15:29,640
Oh!

10261
07:15:30,160 --> 07:15:30,560
Ah!

10262
07:15:31,420 --> 07:15:32,120
Never mind.

10263
07:15:32,260 --> 07:15:33,820
L1 doesn't do anything there, you guys.

10264
07:15:34,200 --> 07:15:34,900
I lied.

10265
07:15:35,780 --> 07:15:38,100
L1 doesn't do anything there!

10266
07:15:40,540 --> 07:15:41,540
L1 doesn't do anything!

10267
07:15:42,280 --> 07:15:44,440
After this, you'll be ready for Dark Souls.

10268
07:15:45,340 --> 07:15:45,960
Oh my god.

10269
07:15:46,020 --> 07:15:46,460
No, no, no.

10270
07:15:52,640 --> 07:15:54,760
How did I beat this first try before?

10271
07:15:55,380 --> 07:15:56,480
How did I beat this first try before?

10272
07:15:56,480 --> 07:15:58,440
I was built different back in the past.

10273
07:15:59,300 --> 07:15:59,740
I was built different back in the past.

10274
07:15:59,920 --> 07:16:00,360
Oh!

10275
07:16:00,460 --> 07:16:00,700
Ouch!

10276
07:16:00,980 --> 07:16:01,640
Oh my god.

10277
07:16:01,660 --> 07:16:02,440
I'm on fire again.

10278
07:16:05,700 --> 07:16:07,040
I think I just gotta...

10279
07:16:07,040 --> 07:16:07,520
I think I just gotta...

10280
07:16:07,520 --> 07:16:07,820
Oh my gosh!

10281
07:16:08,680 --> 07:16:10,160
I think I just gotta avoid them.

10282
07:16:15,710 --> 07:16:17,070
I think you have more rations.

10283
07:16:17,230 --> 07:16:17,590
I think you have more rations.

10284
07:16:17,590 --> 07:16:18,510
That might be the case.

10285
07:16:20,410 --> 07:16:20,850
Okay.

10286
07:16:20,850 --> 07:16:22,150
Oh.

10287
07:16:22,310 --> 07:16:23,710
It wasn't interesting before?

10288
07:16:24,630 --> 07:16:25,270
Oh!

10289
07:16:25,410 --> 07:16:25,830
Yeah!

10290
07:16:40,550 --> 07:16:42,710
I'm working on it!

10291
07:16:42,830 --> 07:16:43,770
Why are you calling me?

10292
07:16:48,530 --> 07:16:50,770
Why aren't you zoomed in?

10293
07:16:50,930 --> 07:16:53,850
He had that grandpa angle.

10294
07:16:54,310 --> 07:16:56,590
When grandpa facetimes you.

10295
07:16:57,990 --> 07:16:59,570
When grandpa facetimes you.

10296
07:16:59,570 --> 07:17:01,310
When grandpa facetimes you.

10297
07:17:03,930 --> 07:17:04,990
When grandpa facetimes you.

10298
07:17:06,030 --> 07:17:08,030
When grandpa facetimes you.

10299
07:17:08,350 --> 07:17:10,110
When grandpa facetimes you.

10300
07:17:10,110 --> 07:17:12,470
T-that's not right.

10301
07:17:12,470 --> 07:17:13,530
T -that's not right.

10302
07:17:13,730 --> 07:17:17,150
Why are you guys so quiet?

10303
07:17:17,370 --> 07:17:17,770
...

10304
07:17:17,770 --> 07:17:18,450
...

10305
07:17:19,970 --> 07:17:20,770
...

10306
07:17:20,770 --> 07:17:26,610
You looked so defeated.

10307
07:17:27,210 --> 07:17:27,890
Don't cry.

10308
07:17:28,750 --> 07:17:30,110
Oh I see a tear.

10309
07:17:30,110 --> 07:17:32,250
Oh don't cry Raiden.

10310
07:17:33,470 --> 07:17:34,770
Don't cry.

10311
07:17:38,010 --> 07:17:39,470
I'm working on it!

10312
07:17:41,250 --> 07:17:42,650
Now I'm out of the groove!

10313
07:17:43,170 --> 07:17:43,490
Oh my god.

10314
07:17:50,630 --> 07:17:55,710
I was holding L1 though!

10315
07:17:55,910 --> 07:17:57,470
I was holding L1.

10316
07:17:57,930 --> 07:17:58,470
Oh my god.

10317
07:17:58,590 --> 07:17:59,150
Oh my god.

10318
07:17:59,270 --> 07:18:00,050
Oh no.

10319
07:18:00,050 --> 07:18:01,530
Hold on.

10320
07:18:09,760 --> 07:18:10,160
Guys!

10321
07:18:11,680 --> 07:18:12,340
Oh my god.

10322
07:18:12,520 --> 07:18:14,600
I don't think this is it.

10323
07:18:14,780 --> 07:18:16,000
I don't have any more health.

10324
07:18:21,890 --> 07:18:23,890
I didn't see... unless they give you more rations.

10325
07:18:24,150 --> 07:18:25,590
Do they give you more rations in...

10326
07:18:25,590 --> 07:18:27,910
Ha Raiden!

10327
07:18:30,190 --> 07:18:30,990
Call Otacon?

10328
07:18:31,310 --> 07:18:31,630
Okay.

10329
07:18:32,130 --> 07:18:33,070
Let's call him now.

10330
07:18:34,650 --> 07:18:35,610
What does he got to say?

10331
07:18:39,100 --> 07:18:42,160
Raiden, you don't have a lot going for you with just your bare hands.

10332
07:18:42,160 --> 07:18:43,660
You have your own blade.

10333
07:18:43,960 --> 07:18:44,560
Use it.

10334
07:18:45,780 --> 07:18:46,440
Okay.

10335
07:18:55,440 --> 07:18:56,860
What an asshole.

10336
07:18:57,240 --> 07:18:57,980
You know what Otacon?

10337
07:18:59,380 --> 07:19:00,040
Wow.

10338
07:19:03,260 --> 07:19:05,220
Raiden, take Solonus down.

10339
07:19:05,500 --> 07:19:08,020
Think about Ogre's child and your rosemary.

10340
07:19:08,320 --> 07:19:09,540
You must win.

10341
07:19:09,920 --> 07:19:11,280
Nice angle grandpa.

10342
07:19:11,640 --> 07:19:11,920
Okay.

10343
07:19:23,860 --> 07:19:24,920
Oh shoot.

10344
07:19:25,080 --> 07:19:26,020
What the...

10345
07:19:26,020 --> 07:19:26,640
What's wrong with you?

10346
07:19:26,640 --> 07:19:26,980
What's wrong with you?

10347
07:19:28,000 --> 07:19:28,640
Wait!

10348
07:19:28,880 --> 07:19:30,660
I was... I couldn't move!

10349
07:19:35,800 --> 07:19:38,880
Oh my god.

10350
07:19:39,000 --> 07:19:40,040
What the hell?

10351
07:19:49,770 --> 07:19:50,370
There we go.

10352
07:19:50,590 --> 07:19:51,650
Oh my god.

10353
07:19:51,750 --> 07:19:55,030
I'm like pressing X and he's lying down.

10354
07:19:55,890 --> 07:19:57,090
What are you doing?

10355
07:19:57,090 --> 07:19:57,230
What are you doing?

10356
07:19:58,210 --> 07:19:58,850
Oh my god.

10357
07:19:58,870 --> 07:19:59,550
These things again.

10358
07:20:02,330 --> 07:20:05,870
You guys, I think I'm in trouble.

10359
07:20:06,430 --> 07:20:07,670
I need more rations.

10360
07:20:07,850 --> 07:20:08,750
I don't have enough.

10361
07:20:09,610 --> 07:20:12,090
I'm not good at sword fight, you guys.

10362
07:20:12,210 --> 07:20:13,730
This is so janky.

10363
07:20:16,630 --> 07:20:17,270
Oh my god.

10364
07:20:17,730 --> 07:20:18,130
Okay.

10365
07:20:22,930 --> 07:20:23,470
Thank you.

10366
07:20:40,980 --> 07:20:43,380
How can you still do fire also?

10367
07:20:43,660 --> 07:20:44,060
Oh my god.

10368
07:20:44,120 --> 07:20:45,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

10369
07:20:46,460 --> 07:20:46,900
Okay.

10370
07:20:47,040 --> 07:20:47,860
That was weird.

10371
07:20:48,240 --> 07:20:51,140
Sorry, my... It wasn't attacking anymore.

10372
07:20:51,360 --> 07:20:51,900
Oh my god.

10373
07:20:52,020 --> 07:20:52,460
Stop.

10374
07:20:55,260 --> 07:20:57,300
Thank goodness you improved your group strength.

10375
07:20:57,800 --> 07:20:59,020
Does that really make a difference?

10376
07:20:59,200 --> 07:20:59,680
Oh my god.

10377
07:21:00,020 --> 07:21:04,020
I'm gonna fucking lose my brain cells with this guy.

10378
07:21:06,240 --> 07:21:07,780
Maybe stab more.

10379
07:21:18,890 --> 07:21:21,050
Just remember the basics of CQC.

10380
07:21:21,230 --> 07:21:23,670
Yeah, totally applicable in this fight.

10381
07:21:23,950 --> 07:21:24,890
Totally applicable.

10382
07:21:26,150 --> 07:21:30,350
L1 doesn't do shit this fucking game.

10383
07:21:30,510 --> 07:21:31,550
I swear to god.

10384
07:21:32,850 --> 07:21:33,370
I

10385
07:21:36,660 --> 07:21:36,880
didn't...

10386
07:21:36,880 --> 07:21:41,540
I didn't... When I press X, I really need you to... I really need you to cartwheel away.

10387
07:21:41,660 --> 07:21:42,060
Okay, buddy.

10388
07:21:42,200 --> 07:21:44,000
I really need you to do it, please.

10389
07:21:45,580 --> 07:21:48,060
I just really need you... Oh god.

10390
07:21:48,380 --> 07:21:48,960
Oh my god.

10391
07:21:51,200 --> 07:21:51,720
God.

10392
07:21:59,310 --> 07:22:00,190
Oh, oops.

10393
07:22:00,370 --> 07:22:00,750
There we go.

10394
07:22:01,290 --> 07:22:02,570
Can you get off, please?

10395
07:22:44,080 --> 07:22:46,460
He sounds like an actual snake when he goes...

10396
07:22:53,690 --> 07:22:55,290
I hate the sword.

10397
07:22:55,910 --> 07:22:57,270
I hate the sword.

10398
07:22:57,870 --> 07:22:58,970
I hate the sword.

10399
07:23:00,110 --> 07:23:01,810
I hate the sword.

10400
07:23:01,910 --> 07:23:02,650
Oh my god.

10401
07:23:02,670 --> 07:23:03,450
I hate the sword.

10402
07:23:05,210 --> 07:23:05,690
Oh my god.

10403
07:23:05,750 --> 07:23:06,450
Oh my god.

10404
07:23:06,550 --> 07:23:06,990
Nooo.

10405
07:23:07,630 --> 07:23:09,790
Sometimes you stab and sometimes you don't.

10406
07:23:09,810 --> 07:23:10,250
Raiden.

10407
07:23:10,810 --> 07:23:11,490
Raiden, why?

10408
07:23:11,770 --> 07:23:12,070
Oh god.

10409
07:23:13,130 --> 07:23:13,570
Raiden.

10410
07:23:14,530 --> 07:23:14,970
Yeah.

10411
07:23:16,590 --> 07:23:18,870
Can you give me another ration, please?

10412
07:23:20,150 --> 07:23:20,590
Something.

10413
07:23:22,350 --> 07:23:23,170
Oh my god.

10414
07:23:59,390 --> 07:24:00,450
So, I have a question.

10415
07:24:00,610 --> 07:24:02,870
If I do left on the joystick, am I...

10416
07:24:04,650 --> 07:24:05,650
Shut up, Colonel.

10417
07:24:05,810 --> 07:24:08,150
Am I swinging to the left or am I swinging to the right?

10418
07:24:08,190 --> 07:24:08,510
Hold on.

10419
07:24:09,870 --> 07:24:14,790
Because people are like, go towards... See, I'm... I can't tell.

10420
07:24:14,930 --> 07:24:17,370
That was... The first one was... What?

10421
07:24:17,590 --> 07:24:18,270
Okay, hold on.

10422
07:24:20,130 --> 07:24:22,570
Okay, so if I go right, I swing from the right.

10423
07:24:22,710 --> 07:24:22,930
Okay.

10424
07:24:23,870 --> 07:24:24,550
There we go.

10425
07:24:24,690 --> 07:24:25,150
Like that.

10426
07:24:25,330 --> 07:24:25,730
Okay, okay.

10427
07:24:28,550 --> 07:24:30,270
But it doesn't really do much.

10428
07:24:31,590 --> 07:24:35,350
And also, sometimes it inputs as ups up and I don't know why.

10429
07:24:45,730 --> 07:24:46,610
I don't want to watch all of them.

10430
07:24:54,720 --> 07:24:55,120
Nice.

10431
07:24:55,120 --> 07:24:55,520
Nice.

10432
07:24:55,680 --> 07:24:55,880
Oh!

10433
07:24:55,980 --> 07:24:57,260
I don't want to watch all of them.

10434
07:24:58,400 --> 07:24:58,800
Okay.

10435
07:24:59,920 --> 07:25:02,080
If you ask me to, I would...

10436
07:25:02,080 --> 07:25:03,920
I got nowhere else to go.

10437
07:25:04,820 --> 07:25:06,740
It was either that or the...

10438
07:25:06,740 --> 07:25:08,180
Why do you have missiles?

10439
07:25:08,460 --> 07:25:10,140
Why can't you... Why do you have missiles?

10440
07:25:11,840 --> 07:25:12,420
Hold on.

10441
07:25:12,440 --> 07:25:13,240
I'll start over.

10442
07:25:17,480 --> 07:25:18,700
Yeah, I'm not really going to...

10443
07:25:25,660 --> 07:25:26,920
I hate Colonel.

10444
07:25:27,020 --> 07:25:27,940
He's pissing me off.

10445
07:25:31,640 --> 07:25:35,520
Oh my god.

10446
07:25:35,600 --> 07:25:40,680
Why sometimes I can do it from the right and it seriously inputs as...

10447
07:25:47,680 --> 07:25:48,960
What's wrong with my controller?

10448
07:25:54,930 --> 07:25:56,190
What's wrong with this game?

10449
07:25:58,110 --> 07:25:58,710
Why?

10450
07:25:58,910 --> 07:26:02,350
Why if I swipe right, it says I'm doing up?

10451
07:26:04,830 --> 07:26:05,590
Oh my god.

10452
07:26:05,970 --> 07:26:06,990
I can't.

10453
07:26:06,990 --> 07:26:07,650
I can't.

10454
07:26:07,650 --> 07:26:08,210
I can't.

10455
07:26:08,310 --> 07:26:08,850
Come here.

10456
07:26:09,110 --> 07:26:09,350
Come here.

10457
07:26:09,390 --> 07:26:09,910
Come here.

10458
07:26:10,030 --> 07:26:10,450
Oh my god.

10459
07:26:12,110 --> 07:26:14,050
I'm so tired, you guys.

10460
07:26:14,170 --> 07:26:15,170
I'm so tired.

10461
07:26:15,410 --> 07:26:16,130
I'm so tired.

10462
07:26:20,910 --> 07:26:21,350
Point

10463
07:26:44,800 --> 07:26:45,980
of standing up.

10464
07:26:46,100 --> 07:26:54,700
Oh, you were doing... You were doing less damage to me as I was laying on the ground like a fucking potato than me actually moving.

10465
07:27:40,540 --> 07:27:42,200
Are you going to launch missiles at me?

10466
07:27:42,340 --> 07:27:42,460
No?

10467
07:27:43,920 --> 07:27:44,440
Side.

10468
07:27:57,400 --> 07:28:00,480
Why have I done like no damage to you, man?

10469
07:28:01,720 --> 07:28:03,760
This is so stinky.

10470
07:28:04,460 --> 07:28:05,920
This is so stinky.

10471
07:28:10,180 --> 07:28:11,220
Left side.

10472
07:28:11,300 --> 07:28:11,860
Right side.

10473
07:28:17,580 --> 07:28:18,600
That's me at you.

10474
07:28:19,420 --> 07:28:19,940
Okay.

10475
07:28:21,260 --> 07:28:22,120
All right.

10476
07:28:27,080 --> 07:28:30,260
I don't know how... How did I do this first time last time?

10477
07:28:30,460 --> 07:28:34,200
That must have been... That must have been an absolute like... Oh my god.

10478
07:28:36,420 --> 07:28:37,580
Nirvana or something.

10479
07:28:45,890 --> 07:28:53,450
I don't like doing the pierce because it takes too long to recover from it.

10480
07:28:58,190 --> 07:28:59,970
Is that the best way?

10481
07:29:20,760 --> 07:29:21,320
R2.

10482
07:29:21,480 --> 07:29:22,260
Wait, there's R2?

10483
07:29:22,500 --> 07:29:23,740
Oh my god.

10484
07:29:24,100 --> 07:29:25,020
Oh shit.

10485
07:29:25,080 --> 07:29:25,680
I'm dying.

10486
07:29:33,170 --> 07:29:34,630
Oh my god.

10487
07:29:35,090 --> 07:29:36,170
What's wrong with you?

10488
07:29:41,450 --> 07:29:44,450
Why does he have such a big health bar too?

10489
07:29:44,670 --> 07:29:45,470
So unfair.

10490
07:30:02,300 --> 07:30:03,080
Oh my god.

10491
07:30:03,080 --> 07:30:03,380
Please.

10492
07:30:03,680 --> 07:30:06,380
Every time I try to grab your ass.

10493
07:30:09,900 --> 07:30:11,900
That move is so OP.

10494
07:30:12,800 --> 07:30:14,800
You already have my oxygen.

10495
07:30:15,100 --> 07:30:16,840
Why do I have to also...

10496
07:30:18,380 --> 07:30:19,420
Be careful.

10497
07:30:19,680 --> 07:30:22,420
Or do I also have to be slammed on the ground?

10498
07:30:24,040 --> 07:30:24,840
Oh my god.

10499
07:30:25,180 --> 07:30:31,020
I can't see when I'm... I'm stabbing him but like I'm getting the angle wrong obviously.

10500
07:30:31,140 --> 07:30:32,080
But I'm like...

10501
07:30:33,380 --> 07:30:33,860
How?

10502
07:30:34,120 --> 07:30:35,360
How am I supposed to...

10503
07:30:35,360 --> 07:30:37,460
The camera angle is just so funky.

10504
07:30:41,040 --> 07:30:41,800
Oh my god.

10505
07:30:41,820 --> 07:30:43,400
Why do you turn around?

10506
07:30:43,860 --> 07:30:45,240
I'm not even moving.

10507
07:30:52,090 --> 07:30:53,590
I almost ran into that.

10508
07:30:54,050 --> 07:30:55,350
This is so messed up.

10509
07:30:55,650 --> 07:30:57,570
This is so messed up, Solidus.

10510
07:30:57,670 --> 07:31:00,070
I wasn't worried about this fight but now I am.

10511
07:31:00,290 --> 07:31:02,570
I wasn't worried about this fight but now I am.

10512
07:31:02,770 --> 07:31:03,250
Oh my god.

10513
07:31:04,210 --> 07:31:07,530
Can we not have the camera angle change while I'm running?

10514
07:31:08,230 --> 07:31:09,630
And while he decides to...

10515
07:31:09,650 --> 07:31:10,070
Do that.

10516
07:31:12,370 --> 07:31:12,850
But

10517
07:31:19,400 --> 07:31:21,800
like I've tried blocking stuff and it wasn't working.

10518
07:31:22,040 --> 07:31:22,660
So I don't know.

10519
07:31:23,440 --> 07:31:23,780
Take this.

10520
07:31:24,040 --> 07:31:24,520
Okay.

10521
07:31:25,680 --> 07:31:26,160
Okay.

10522
07:31:27,380 --> 07:31:27,860
I

10523
07:31:36,240 --> 07:31:36,720
really...

10524
07:31:36,720 --> 07:31:37,020
No.

10525
07:31:37,240 --> 07:31:37,840
You guys...

10526
07:31:37,840 --> 07:31:39,380
I don't need you guys to be like...

10527
07:31:39,380 --> 07:31:39,960
Do this.

10528
07:31:40,040 --> 07:31:40,360
Do this.

10529
07:31:40,680 --> 07:31:41,300
You know?

10530
07:31:41,540 --> 07:31:42,480
It's okay though.

10531
07:31:45,020 --> 07:31:45,680
Oh my god.

10532
07:31:45,700 --> 07:31:45,840
Oh.

10533
07:31:46,140 --> 07:31:46,620
Okay.

10534
07:31:49,460 --> 07:31:49,940
Yippee.

10535
07:32:05,850 --> 07:32:07,510
Why are you still going?

10536
07:32:07,610 --> 07:32:08,370
I'm dead.

10537
07:32:08,410 --> 07:32:08,530
Why are you still going?

10538
07:32:20,270 --> 07:32:20,890
This

10539
07:32:24,560 --> 07:32:25,840
is so stupid.

10540
07:32:37,630 --> 07:32:42,190
So when he goes above I wonder if I can block that or it's just too...

10541
07:32:45,600 --> 07:32:46,550
I'm on fire.

10542
07:32:46,910 --> 07:32:47,530
Oh no.

10543
07:32:47,830 --> 07:32:48,950
How am I alive?

10544
07:32:48,950 --> 07:32:49,190
We're alive!

10545
07:32:50,590 --> 07:32:52,350
PJ, thanks for the gift.

10546
07:32:57,780 --> 07:33:00,220
Why do you sometimes do more than one?

10547
07:33:00,280 --> 07:33:01,540
Sometimes you don't.

10548
07:33:03,040 --> 07:33:04,740
Oh my god.

10549
07:33:05,780 --> 07:33:07,680
I can't read them at all.

10550
07:33:10,480 --> 07:33:11,160
What?

10551
07:33:12,560 --> 07:33:14,120
In one hit?

10552
07:33:22,040 --> 07:33:23,040
It's so strong.

10553
07:33:57,080 --> 07:33:59,780
I just got to do a little frustration cry.

10554
07:34:21,580 --> 07:34:25,100
I was like, I'm not worried at all about this fight.

10555
07:34:25,380 --> 07:34:27,400
I did it in one shot before.

10556
07:34:32,660 --> 07:34:34,420
I think I'm just tired.

10557
07:34:36,020 --> 07:34:37,440
Since I've had a long week.

10558
07:34:40,020 --> 07:34:40,300
Sorry.

10559
07:34:50,270 --> 07:34:51,390
Need food?

10560
07:34:51,610 --> 07:34:52,210
No, I'm good.

10561
07:34:52,410 --> 07:34:53,490
I already ate.

10562
07:34:55,150 --> 07:34:56,410
I ate earlier.

10563
07:34:59,510 --> 07:35:03,870
Liquid had some sense of honor and fair play to face off compared to Solidus.

10564
07:35:03,910 --> 07:35:04,210
Right!

10565
07:35:07,070 --> 07:35:07,830
Well, kind of.

10566
07:35:07,850 --> 07:35:11,650
I mean, Liquid still went into the Metal Gear against a singular man.

10567
07:35:13,550 --> 07:35:14,050
But...

10568
07:35:15,070 --> 07:35:17,430
It was more even in the car fight.

10569
07:35:25,290 --> 07:35:26,690
One singular man.

10570
07:35:29,970 --> 07:35:31,550
I'm gonna go get some water.

10571
07:35:31,630 --> 07:35:32,370
I'll be right back.

10572
07:35:37,390 --> 07:35:38,610
I'll be right back.

10573
07:37:36,430 --> 07:37:37,210
Okie dokie.

10574
07:37:37,310 --> 07:37:38,330
I got some honey water.

10575
07:37:40,830 --> 07:37:43,670
I don't want to drink tea because it's kind of late.

10576
07:37:50,710 --> 07:37:51,270
Yummy.

10577
07:37:55,210 --> 07:37:56,030
Yummy, yummy.

10578
07:38:10,420 --> 07:38:11,420
Okie dokie.

10579
07:38:14,370 --> 07:38:15,010
Okie dokie.

10580
07:38:15,010 --> 07:38:16,270
I'll try to block more.

10581
07:38:17,830 --> 07:38:18,470
I'll try to block more.

10582
07:38:18,470 --> 07:38:18,810
And...

10583
07:38:21,510 --> 07:38:23,150
I'll try to beat him.

10584
07:38:27,750 --> 07:38:29,850
Skill issue something something.

10585
07:38:30,450 --> 07:38:30,530
Skill issue something something.

10586
07:38:36,800 --> 07:38:37,740
Get behind him.

10587
07:38:37,800 --> 07:38:38,480
Yeah, I've been trying.

10588
07:38:40,140 --> 07:38:41,640
He's a slippery snake.

10589
07:38:42,220 --> 07:38:42,860
He's a slippery snake.

10590
07:38:46,810 --> 07:38:47,250
Ok.

10591
07:39:00,060 --> 07:39:00,940
Oh my god.

10592
07:39:01,820 --> 07:39:03,040
Great start, Raiden.

10593
07:39:05,200 --> 07:39:06,340
See, like that?

10594
07:39:07,360 --> 07:39:09,280
When I try to...

10595
07:39:09,280 --> 07:39:10,120
Ok, when he does...

10596
07:39:10,120 --> 07:39:11,200
When he revs up for that...

10597
07:39:11,200 --> 07:39:14,360
See, I was holding L1 there.

10598
07:39:14,580 --> 07:39:16,040
I was holding L1.

10599
07:39:16,100 --> 07:39:16,540
I promise.

10600
07:39:18,360 --> 07:39:19,280
Oh, it does work.

10601
07:39:19,360 --> 07:39:19,840
That works.

10602
07:39:20,200 --> 07:39:22,760
Ok, let's see what he can block.

10603
07:39:23,640 --> 07:39:24,140
Ok.

10604
07:39:24,900 --> 07:39:25,180
Ok.

10605
07:39:26,680 --> 07:39:27,040
Ok.

10606
07:39:30,560 --> 07:39:30,920
Ok.

10607
07:39:32,940 --> 07:39:33,660
Ok.

10608
07:39:37,920 --> 07:39:38,640
Ok.

10609
07:39:39,660 --> 07:39:40,380
Ok.

10610
07:39:42,420 --> 07:39:43,800
Oh, what the?

10611
07:39:45,120 --> 07:39:45,920
What the lag?

10612
07:39:46,440 --> 07:39:47,160
Ok.

10613
07:39:48,340 --> 07:39:50,140
Oh shoot, I turned!

10614
07:39:50,700 --> 07:39:53,160
I turned!

10615
07:39:53,780 --> 07:39:54,780
Wait, where's the ration?

10616
07:39:54,860 --> 07:39:55,160
There it is.

10617
07:39:57,320 --> 07:39:59,020
The angle of the block has to be...

10618
07:39:59,020 --> 07:40:00,220
extremely specific then.

10619
07:40:00,700 --> 07:40:01,600
Oh, come on.

10620
07:40:11,620 --> 07:40:12,420
I'm blocking!

10621
07:40:13,380 --> 07:40:13,900
Oh,

10622
07:40:23,620 --> 07:40:24,580
that didn't work.

10623
07:40:28,740 --> 07:40:29,600
I'm on fire.

10624
07:40:30,060 --> 07:40:30,840
No, I'm not.

10625
07:40:33,320 --> 07:40:34,100
I'm block...

10626
07:40:41,420 --> 07:40:41,600
Oh!

10627
07:40:41,820 --> 07:40:42,780
Ok, so I cannot...

10628
07:40:42,780 --> 07:40:44,020
block the over...

10629
07:40:44,640 --> 07:40:45,520
overhead one.

10630
07:40:45,620 --> 07:40:46,560
That's good to know.

10631
07:40:46,720 --> 07:40:47,200
Oh!

10632
07:40:47,400 --> 07:40:47,920
Wow.

10633
07:40:49,260 --> 07:40:50,020
I'm blocking.

10634
07:40:50,300 --> 07:40:50,500
Oh!

10635
07:40:50,500 --> 07:40:52,820
Sorry, I just realized which one it was.

10636
07:40:53,720 --> 07:40:54,400
I'm blocking!

10637
07:40:55,120 --> 07:40:55,840
I'm blocking!

10638
07:40:56,200 --> 07:40:56,840
Yeah, yeah.

10639
07:40:56,940 --> 07:40:57,420
What's that?

10640
07:40:57,640 --> 07:40:58,760
Yeah, you scared of my...

10641
07:41:01,000 --> 07:41:02,000
Don't laugh at me.

10642
07:41:02,300 --> 07:41:03,960
Don't laugh at me, Solidus.

10643
07:41:06,000 --> 07:41:06,660
I'm blocking!

10644
07:41:09,500 --> 07:41:10,120
What the?

10645
07:41:10,280 --> 07:41:11,320
Why did you block back?

10646
07:41:12,920 --> 07:41:13,720
I'm on fire.

10647
07:41:15,500 --> 07:41:16,280
I'm blocking!

10648
07:41:17,640 --> 07:41:18,380
I'm blocking!

10649
07:41:19,120 --> 07:41:19,560
Oh!

10650
07:41:20,720 --> 07:41:22,000
I'll never learn my lesson.

10651
07:41:23,380 --> 07:41:24,840
I'll never learn my lesson.

10652
07:41:25,360 --> 07:41:26,840
Yeah, you afraid of my sword?

10653
07:41:27,080 --> 07:41:29,080
Why do you look so tiny in that thing?

10654
07:41:44,270 --> 07:41:45,250
Why is he look...

10655
07:41:45,250 --> 07:41:46,290
Is he really that small?

10656
07:41:46,370 --> 07:41:47,570
Is Raiden really that tall?

10657
07:41:47,750 --> 07:41:48,390
I can't...

10658
07:41:50,550 --> 07:41:51,510
I can't tell.

10659
07:41:53,450 --> 07:41:54,190
Oh my god.

10660
07:41:54,350 --> 07:41:56,450
Ok, if it's the other side...

10661
07:41:56,450 --> 07:41:57,310
he's gonna sweep me.

10662
07:42:04,080 --> 07:42:05,840
But if it's the left side...

10663
07:42:05,840 --> 07:42:06,360
he's gonna...

10664
07:42:07,080 --> 07:42:07,400
Oh!

10665
07:42:07,500 --> 07:42:08,000
Like that!

10666
07:42:08,200 --> 07:42:08,540
See?

10667
07:42:08,680 --> 07:42:08,840
See?

10668
07:42:08,900 --> 07:42:09,080
See?

10669
07:42:09,220 --> 07:42:10,540
Ok, ok, ok.

10670
07:42:16,040 --> 07:42:17,780
I'm just testing...

10671
07:42:17,780 --> 07:42:19,620
how to get used to...

10672
07:42:19,620 --> 07:42:20,280
Ok, ok.

10673
07:42:22,560 --> 07:42:23,160
Ok.

10674
07:42:23,560 --> 07:42:24,720
I'm blocking!

10675
07:42:25,040 --> 07:42:25,660
I'm blocking!

10676
07:42:27,200 --> 07:42:29,060
Hang in there, Minto.

10677
07:42:29,340 --> 07:42:29,980
Thank you.

10678
07:42:31,820 --> 07:42:32,420
Oh!

10679
07:42:33,840 --> 07:42:36,960
I guess I should probably like...

10680
07:42:36,960 --> 07:42:38,300
I guess I should probably like...

10681
07:42:40,810 --> 07:42:41,370
Yeah!

10682
07:42:42,570 --> 07:42:43,130
Triple...

10683
07:42:43,130 --> 07:42:44,130
Oh, I can't see myself.

10684
07:42:44,430 --> 07:42:44,990
Oh my god.

10685
07:42:47,630 --> 07:42:48,670
Can't block those!

10686
07:42:49,190 --> 07:42:49,290
Can't block those!

10687
07:42:50,390 --> 07:42:54,510
What's wrong with you?

10688
07:42:54,510 --> 07:42:55,390
What's wrong with you?

10689
07:43:00,530 --> 07:43:02,670
Solidus is 5'11 according to Google.

10690
07:43:02,910 --> 07:43:03,070
Solidus is 5'11 according to Google.

10691
07:43:03,210 --> 07:43:03,770
What?

10692
07:43:03,910 --> 07:43:04,630
He's not tall?

10693
07:43:04,770 --> 07:43:05,350
But he look...

10694
07:43:05,350 --> 07:43:06,790
How tall is Raiden then?

10695
07:43:07,570 --> 07:43:08,390
I'm blocking.

10696
07:43:08,950 --> 07:43:09,770
I'm blocking.

10697
07:43:10,270 --> 07:43:11,070
I'm blocking.

10698
07:43:12,010 --> 07:43:13,190
And you're blocking too.

10699
07:43:13,410 --> 07:43:14,330
And I'm blocking.

10700
07:43:14,510 --> 07:43:15,130
And you're blocking.

10701
07:43:15,290 --> 07:43:16,010
And I'm blocking.

10702
07:43:16,350 --> 07:43:17,490
And you're blocking.

10703
07:43:17,730 --> 07:43:18,990
And I'm blocking.

10704
07:43:19,330 --> 07:43:20,330
And you're blocking.

10705
07:43:20,570 --> 07:43:21,990
And I'm blocking.

10706
07:43:22,590 --> 07:43:24,070
I've got you in a corner.

10707
07:43:24,290 --> 07:43:24,730
Oh shoot!

10708
07:43:24,910 --> 07:43:25,750
You swept me!

10709
07:43:25,910 --> 07:43:27,030
You side swept me!

10710
07:43:27,450 --> 07:43:29,290
And I'm blocking.

10711
07:43:29,490 --> 07:43:30,290
And you're blocking.

10712
07:43:30,470 --> 07:43:31,230
And I'm blocking.

10713
07:43:31,790 --> 07:43:32,910
Not fair!

10714
07:43:40,530 --> 07:43:41,370
I'm blocking.

10715
07:43:43,070 --> 07:43:44,530
And you're blocking!

10716
07:43:45,570 --> 07:43:46,170
And you're blocking!

10717
07:43:46,170 --> 07:43:46,170
Oh!

10718
07:43:46,170 --> 07:43:47,550
And I'm blocking!

10719
07:43:50,450 --> 07:43:51,850
And you're blocking!

10720
07:43:52,230 --> 07:43:52,390
And you're blocking!

10721
07:43:52,390 --> 07:43:52,390
And you're blocking!

10722
07:43:52,390 --> 07:43:52,830
Oh my God!

10723
07:43:54,030 --> 07:43:54,630
Oh!

10724
07:43:56,260 --> 07:43:57,160
I'm blocking!

10725
07:43:57,380 --> 07:43:58,140
And you're blocking!

10726
07:43:58,320 --> 07:43:58,840
And I'm blocking!

10727
07:44:01,760 --> 07:44:03,360
And you're blocking!

10728
07:44:04,440 --> 07:44:05,120
And I'm blocking!

10729
07:44:05,540 --> 07:44:07,100
And you're blocking!

10730
07:44:07,300 --> 07:44:08,080
And I'm blocking!

10731
07:44:08,340 --> 07:44:08,900
And then you block!

10732
07:44:09,360 --> 07:44:09,660
And then...

10733
07:44:13,080 --> 07:44:15,680
I probably shouldn't stand so close to the guy.

10734
07:44:23,260 --> 07:44:25,520
I'm blocking and then you're blocking.

10735
07:44:25,740 --> 07:44:27,540
How could you even triangle it?

10736
07:44:27,700 --> 07:44:28,420
Like how can you...

10737
07:44:28,420 --> 07:44:29,640
Maybe if I...

10738
07:44:29,640 --> 07:44:30,280
Oh, shoot.

10739
07:44:31,300 --> 07:44:32,340
I'm blocking.

10740
07:44:32,940 --> 07:44:33,840
Oh, no.

10741
07:44:33,980 --> 07:44:36,040
I never learned my lesson.

10742
07:44:46,520 --> 07:44:47,620
It's so unfair.

10743
07:44:48,300 --> 07:44:49,320
There we are.

10744
07:44:50,420 --> 07:44:51,700
I'm just chipping away.

10745
07:44:51,980 --> 07:44:52,760
I'm just chipping away.

10746
07:44:53,600 --> 07:44:55,200
And I block and you block.

10747
07:44:55,400 --> 07:44:56,300
And I block.

10748
07:44:56,380 --> 07:44:57,140
I'm blocking.

10749
07:44:57,840 --> 07:44:58,400
Yeah.

10750
07:45:00,380 --> 07:45:00,940
What?

10751
07:45:01,200 --> 07:45:01,760
Oh!

10752
07:45:01,840 --> 07:45:02,520
Oh, nice.

10753
07:45:03,340 --> 07:45:05,000
I'm blocking and you're blocking.

10754
07:45:05,800 --> 07:45:06,660
I'm blocking.

10755
07:45:06,840 --> 07:45:09,320
Yeah, maybe we could do that the entire rest of the...

10756
07:45:09,320 --> 07:45:10,660
Oh, shoot.

10757
07:45:14,360 --> 07:45:15,200
Oh, you missed.

10758
07:45:15,680 --> 07:45:17,040
And I'm...

10759
07:45:17,620 --> 07:45:19,120
Shit, I missed too.

10760
07:45:20,440 --> 07:45:20,960
Oh.

10761
07:45:23,420 --> 07:45:23,940
God,

10762
07:45:27,190 --> 07:45:27,650
I can't...

10763
07:45:27,650 --> 07:45:28,150
I can't see.

10764
07:45:28,370 --> 07:45:28,850
Oh, God.

10765
07:45:28,930 --> 07:45:30,690
Oh, how did I make it?

10766
07:45:30,730 --> 07:45:31,270
How did I live?

10767
07:45:31,610 --> 07:45:31,870
Oh.

10768
07:45:34,610 --> 07:45:36,310
I'm blocking and you're blocking.

10769
07:45:43,080 --> 07:45:43,600
Nice.

10770
07:45:46,220 --> 07:45:48,120
I'm blocking and you're blocking.

10771
07:45:49,960 --> 07:45:50,480
Do

10772
07:45:56,840 --> 07:45:57,800
I have any rations left?

10773
07:45:57,940 --> 07:45:58,120
No.

10774
07:45:58,120 --> 07:46:00,840
The game says get good.

10775
07:46:00,900 --> 07:46:02,140
Get good, lady.

10776
07:46:05,460 --> 07:46:06,640
One more.

10777
07:46:06,780 --> 07:46:07,540
Nice.

10778
07:46:08,360 --> 07:46:09,440
I'm blocking.

10779
07:46:10,900 --> 07:46:12,300
You're running away.

10780
07:46:18,170 --> 07:46:18,930
Yup.

10781
07:46:19,050 --> 07:46:20,330
Oh, we're standing here.

10782
07:46:23,510 --> 07:46:24,750
Get him.

10783
07:46:24,770 --> 07:46:25,190
Get him.

10784
07:46:25,570 --> 07:46:25,890
Oh.

10785
07:46:25,970 --> 07:46:26,730
Wait.

10786
07:46:27,390 --> 07:46:27,970
Phase two?

10787
07:46:30,830 --> 07:46:32,070
Phase two.

10788
07:46:32,110 --> 07:46:32,250
Oh.

10789
07:46:35,590 --> 07:46:43,810
I realize that I don't like to play with swords.

10790
07:46:44,270 --> 07:46:44,470
Oh.

10791
07:46:44,650 --> 07:46:45,490
Where was I?

10792
07:46:45,630 --> 07:46:46,350
Oh, my God.

10793
07:46:46,670 --> 07:46:47,110
Oh.

10794
07:46:47,330 --> 07:46:47,770
Oh.

10795
07:46:55,550 --> 07:46:56,230
Uh-oh.

10796
07:46:56,530 --> 07:46:57,190
No, no.

10797
07:46:57,890 --> 07:46:58,770
Please, Solidus.

10798
07:46:59,430 --> 07:47:00,310
Please, Solidus.

10799
07:47:00,330 --> 07:47:01,110
I don't have any more.

10800
07:47:01,190 --> 07:47:02,370
I don't have any more rations.

10801
07:47:02,450 --> 07:47:03,690
I'm going to bleed out, Solidus.

10802
07:47:05,790 --> 07:47:06,930
Solidus, I'm going to bleed out.

10803
07:47:07,090 --> 07:47:08,010
I'm going to bleed out.

10804
07:47:08,010 --> 07:47:08,930
Solidus, I'm going to bleed out.

10805
07:47:09,030 --> 07:47:09,590
I'm going to bleed out.

10806
07:47:09,910 --> 07:47:10,190
Solidus?

10807
07:47:10,730 --> 07:47:12,010
Solidus, I'm going to bleed out.

10808
07:47:12,910 --> 07:47:14,230
I'm going to bleed out, Solidus.

10809
07:47:14,650 --> 07:47:15,590
Solidus, I'm going to bleed out.

10810
07:47:18,410 --> 07:47:19,390
Solidus, I'm going to bleed out.

10811
07:47:19,430 --> 07:47:19,890
Oh, God.

10812
07:47:20,490 --> 07:47:21,190
I'm going to bleed out.

10813
07:47:24,790 --> 07:47:25,670
Solidus, I'm going to bleed out.

10814
07:47:29,430 --> 07:47:31,050
I'm going to bleed out, Solidus.

10815
07:47:35,960 --> 07:47:37,000
Solidus, I'm going to bleed out.

10816
07:47:43,400 --> 07:47:43,680
Ouch.

10817
07:47:43,920 --> 07:47:44,440
Oh, God.

10818
07:47:44,620 --> 07:47:45,540
Solidus, I'm going to bleed out.

10819
07:47:46,760 --> 07:47:47,200
I'm going to bleed out, Solidus.

10820
07:47:47,200 --> 07:47:47,260
Solidus, I'm going to bleed out.

10821
07:47:47,260 --> 07:47:47,280
Ouch.

10822
07:47:47,280 --> 07:47:47,320
Oh, God.

10823
07:48:04,380 --> 07:48:05,880
1 HP and a dream!

10824
07:48:11,710 --> 07:48:12,430
Yeah!

10825
07:48:13,270 --> 07:48:15,830
I would like to thank Honeywater.

10826
07:48:28,100 --> 07:48:29,480
You are lost.

10827
07:48:29,860 --> 07:48:30,820
Thank you, Urban.

10828
07:48:31,360 --> 07:48:32,320
Thank you!

10829
07:48:34,960 --> 07:48:37,140
Okay, someone should really get right in some bandages.

10830
07:48:45,240 --> 07:48:47,040
You got animated.

10831
07:48:47,040 --> 07:48:50,540
It's only when we're backed into our toughest corners.

10832
07:48:52,080 --> 07:48:53,460
What does he say there?

10833
07:48:56,420 --> 07:48:58,540
I think he says, it's the crazy frog.

10834
07:49:00,080 --> 07:49:00,700
Honeywater.

10835
07:49:06,500 --> 07:49:07,980
Bleeds out mid cutscene.

10836
07:49:12,510 --> 07:49:13,130
07.

10837
07:49:35,360 --> 07:49:37,120
Oh, so good!

10838
07:49:38,420 --> 07:49:40,420
You know how to make a boss battle exciting.

10839
07:49:42,360 --> 07:49:44,080
Yeah, totally was on purpose.

10840
07:49:46,360 --> 07:49:47,620
David, thank you for the vibe gifted.

10841
07:49:47,760 --> 07:49:48,160
Thank you.

10842
07:49:52,340 --> 07:49:55,900
I want to go there and I want to lay where Solidus died.

10843
07:49:56,500 --> 07:49:57,520
Great job, boss.

10844
07:49:57,700 --> 07:49:58,500
Thank you, Andrangus.

10845
07:49:58,580 --> 07:49:58,940
Thank you!

10846
07:50:10,940 --> 07:50:12,860
Yay, we beat it today, you guys!

10847
07:50:14,160 --> 07:50:14,600
Yippee!

10848
07:50:17,720 --> 07:50:18,600
Oh, man.

10849
07:50:19,600 --> 07:50:20,040
Struggles.

10850
07:50:20,200 --> 07:50:20,640
Struggles.

10851
07:50:20,660 --> 07:50:23,340
Struggled quite a bit in the last two moments, but that's okay.

10852
07:50:24,060 --> 07:50:25,580
Last two fights, rather.

10853
07:50:30,860 --> 07:50:31,420
Yippee!

10854
07:50:41,530 --> 07:50:42,650
Coding boomers.

10855
07:50:49,730 --> 07:50:51,330
Who am I, really?

10856
07:50:52,310 --> 07:50:55,190
No one quite knows who or what they are.

10857
07:50:57,090 --> 07:50:57,610
Snake!

10858
07:50:58,030 --> 07:51:00,510
This ending is so trippy.

10859
07:51:00,730 --> 07:51:02,210
The memories you have and the rules you were assigned are burdens you had to carry.

10860
07:51:02,510 --> 07:51:04,670
It doesn't matter if they were real or not.

10861
07:51:04,830 --> 07:51:05,790
That's never the point.

10862
07:51:12,980 --> 07:51:13,840
It is real.

10863
07:51:13,860 --> 07:51:16,240
There's no such thing in the world as absolute reality.

10864
07:51:16,800 --> 07:51:19,380
Most of what they call real is actually fiction.

10865
07:51:19,660 --> 07:51:26,080
What you think you see is only as real as your brain tells you it is.

10866
07:51:27,440 --> 07:51:29,700
Then, what am I supposed to believe in?

10867
07:51:30,720 --> 07:51:31,540
Whatever you want to.

10868
07:51:31,540 --> 07:51:33,100
What am I going to leave behind when I'm through?

10869
07:51:33,340 --> 07:51:34,600
Believe in whatever you want to believe in.

10870
07:51:34,620 --> 07:51:36,980
You can tell other people about having faith.

10871
07:51:39,820 --> 07:51:41,220
What we had faith in.

10872
07:51:41,940 --> 07:51:42,740
New York.

10873
07:51:42,860 --> 07:51:45,040
What we found important enough to fight for.

10874
07:51:45,780 --> 07:51:49,800
It's not whether you were right or wrong, but how much faith you were willing to have.

10875
07:51:49,920 --> 07:51:51,260
That decides the future.

10876
07:51:52,460 --> 07:51:54,860
The Patriots are a kind of ongoing fiction, too.

10877
07:51:54,960 --> 07:51:55,640
Come to think of it.

10878
07:51:56,860 --> 07:51:58,460
Make the victory all more rewarding.

10879
07:51:58,500 --> 07:51:59,240
Congrats, Pinto.

10880
07:51:59,240 --> 07:51:59,460
Thank you.

10881
07:51:59,460 --> 07:52:00,780
Don't obsess over words so much.

10882
07:52:01,120 --> 07:52:03,540
Find the meaning behind the words, then decide.

10883
07:52:03,540 --> 07:52:07,100
It didn't feel like I was going to win because I kept saying, I'm going to bleed out, Solidus.

10884
07:52:08,220 --> 07:52:11,720
Decide for myself, and whatever you choose will be you.

10885
07:52:12,700 --> 07:52:14,040
I don't know if I can.

10886
07:52:15,260 --> 07:52:18,360
I know you didn't have much in terms of choices this time.

10887
07:52:19,580 --> 07:52:23,540
But everything you felt, thought about during this mission is yours.

10888
07:52:23,820 --> 07:52:26,580
And what you decide to do with them is your choice.

10889
07:52:27,600 --> 07:52:29,040
So what did Raiden do?

10890
07:52:29,040 --> 07:52:31,400
What did he do in between being a child soldier and this?

10891
07:52:39,260 --> 07:52:41,280
Give a recap of what happened?

10892
07:52:41,440 --> 07:52:41,680
Sure.

10893
07:52:41,860 --> 07:52:42,380
I could try.

10894
07:52:47,390 --> 07:52:49,290
It's a little funky, you know?

10895
07:52:51,110 --> 07:52:53,010
By the way, what is that?

10896
07:52:53,630 --> 07:52:54,110
Bull!

10897
07:52:54,630 --> 07:52:55,610
My dog tag!

10898
07:53:00,290 --> 07:53:00,930
Thank you.

10899
07:53:00,950 --> 07:53:01,290
Thank you.

10900
07:53:01,290 --> 07:53:01,970
I'm going to...

10901
07:53:01,970 --> 07:53:02,390
Ah!

10902
07:53:02,590 --> 07:53:03,030
Vito!

10903
07:53:05,070 --> 07:53:06,330
That's my birthday!

10904
07:53:15,250 --> 07:53:16,810
Yeah, it's me.

10905
07:53:17,330 --> 07:53:18,050
What?

10906
07:53:20,610 --> 07:53:21,330
Raiden!

10907
07:53:21,510 --> 07:53:23,630
I'll pick my own name and my own life.

10908
07:53:23,810 --> 07:53:25,430
I'll find something more fascinating.

10909
07:53:25,430 --> 07:53:27,890
I'll pick my own name continues being Raiden.

10910
07:53:35,440 --> 07:53:36,780
They taught me some good things, too.

10911
07:53:37,300 --> 07:53:39,940
I'm getting freaked out seeing my name in the tags after forever.

10912
07:53:39,960 --> 07:53:42,800
I've inherited freedom from all those who fought for it.

10913
07:53:43,540 --> 07:53:45,840
We all have the freedom to spread the word.

10914
07:53:46,200 --> 07:53:46,920
Even me.

10915
07:53:48,300 --> 07:53:50,000
Snake, what about Olga's child?

10916
07:53:50,220 --> 07:53:50,620
Don't worry.

10917
07:53:50,900 --> 07:53:51,880
I'll find it.

10918
07:53:51,900 --> 07:53:52,560
Count on it.

10919
07:53:54,040 --> 07:53:56,880
As long as you keep yourself alive, he's safe.

10920
07:54:02,840 --> 07:54:04,240
Do you know where Liquid went?

10921
07:54:04,460 --> 07:54:06,280
I put a transmitter on his reg.

10922
07:54:06,400 --> 07:54:09,000
I don't think Snake knew the gender of the kid, right?

10923
07:54:09,000 --> 07:54:12,760
But I have a feeling they gave Ocelot a bogus location to begin with.

10924
07:54:13,020 --> 07:54:13,280
You know.

10925
07:54:16,080 --> 07:54:16,800
Cheer up.

10926
07:54:16,860 --> 07:54:17,960
We have a better lead.

10927
07:54:20,660 --> 07:54:23,320
This contains the list of all the Patriots.

10928
07:54:24,320 --> 07:54:25,760
But Ocelot took it.

10929
07:54:25,800 --> 07:54:28,100
The one we gave you wasn't the real thing.

10930
07:54:29,060 --> 07:54:31,160
I'm just going to hold it up in public, you know?

10931
07:54:31,280 --> 07:54:34,940
This virus is coded to destroy only a specific part of GW.

10932
07:54:35,700 --> 07:54:37,920
Namely, the information about the Patriots' identity.

10933
07:54:39,620 --> 07:54:44,800
Which means that there's a parameter coded in here that defines what that information is.

10934
07:54:45,080 --> 07:54:46,740
I get it.

10935
07:54:46,960 --> 07:54:49,880
Analyze the code and you can probably find out where they operate.

10936
07:54:50,440 --> 07:54:51,600
Count me in.

10937
07:54:51,720 --> 07:54:51,940
No.

10938
07:54:52,000 --> 07:54:53,620
You have things to do first.

10939
07:54:53,980 --> 07:54:55,480
You have a lady to please.

10940
07:54:56,120 --> 07:54:57,960
And people you need to talk to.

10941
07:54:58,240 --> 07:55:02,360
And a lady... to talk to.

10942
07:55:09,580 --> 07:55:11,860
Okay, everybody just go about your business.

10943
07:55:13,540 --> 07:55:16,500
Don't worry about the dead president behind the statue.

10944
07:55:17,700 --> 07:55:18,300
Rose!

10945
07:55:24,630 --> 07:55:25,710
We're just going to...

10946
07:55:26,630 --> 07:55:27,910
She's like, howdy!

10947
07:55:33,750 --> 07:55:35,610
You've got furniture to buy.

10948
07:55:37,810 --> 07:55:38,410
Rose!

10949
07:55:46,920 --> 07:55:51,920
His skull suit in this part looks so... it looks so much like the sneaking suit in 3.

10950
07:55:53,980 --> 07:55:54,480
Herbert!

10951
07:55:55,160 --> 07:55:55,860
What's wrong?

10952
07:55:56,420 --> 07:55:58,160
A lot of things, actually.

10953
07:56:02,400 --> 07:56:03,740
She isn't an AI.

10954
07:56:03,820 --> 07:56:04,600
No, she's real.

10955
07:56:05,340 --> 07:56:06,520
Who am I, really?

10956
07:56:07,680 --> 07:56:08,700
I wouldn't know.

10957
07:56:11,040 --> 07:56:11,540
Happy boots?

10958
07:56:11,540 --> 07:56:13,360
But we're going to find out together, aren't we?

10959
07:56:13,360 --> 07:56:14,560
It's better for your circulation.

10960
07:56:22,810 --> 07:56:23,290
Smoosher.

10961
07:56:24,870 --> 07:56:26,550
See me for what I am, okay?

10962
07:56:27,690 --> 07:56:28,650
A dummy...

10963
07:56:28,650 --> 07:56:30,710
I know.

10964
07:56:31,810 --> 07:56:32,870
What are you?

10965
07:56:32,890 --> 07:56:34,130
An idiot sandwich.

10966
07:56:36,430 --> 07:56:37,670
Oh my god, the baby.

10967
07:56:46,740 --> 07:56:49,180
There's still more cutscenes and then when the credits play.

10968
07:56:49,180 --> 07:56:50,220
Do you remember this place?

10969
07:56:50,360 --> 07:56:50,680
Oh god.

10970
07:56:50,680 --> 07:56:52,260
Of course.

10971
07:56:53,300 --> 07:56:54,940
This is where we first met.

10972
07:56:55,980 --> 07:56:57,400
I remember now.

10973
07:56:57,740 --> 07:56:58,700
I remember now.

10974
07:56:59,200 --> 07:57:01,200
Today is the day I met you.

10975
07:57:03,220 --> 07:57:04,040
That's it.

10976
07:57:04,200 --> 07:57:04,940
How could you forget?

10977
07:57:11,730 --> 07:57:13,990
Happy April 30th, everybody.

10978
07:57:16,730 --> 07:57:17,050
Oh,

10979
07:57:21,520 --> 07:57:24,100
happy birthday to my favorite idiot guy.

10980
07:57:24,220 --> 07:57:25,420
My favorite idiot couple.

10981
07:57:25,420 --> 07:57:28,860
I mean, you're having a baby.

10982
07:57:29,180 --> 07:57:30,820
You passed along...

10983
07:57:31,880 --> 07:57:33,540
You're passing along plenty.

10984
07:57:33,920 --> 07:57:35,300
Are you talking about the baby?

10985
07:57:35,840 --> 07:57:36,400
Yeah.

10986
07:57:36,580 --> 07:57:37,060
Yeah.

10987
07:57:37,460 --> 07:57:39,700
But genes aren't the only thing you pass on.

10988
07:57:39,920 --> 07:57:43,140
There are too many things that aren't written into our DNA.

10989
07:57:43,300 --> 07:57:43,920
Rose, I...

10990
07:57:43,920 --> 07:57:44,920
It's up to us to teach them to our children.

10991
07:57:44,920 --> 07:57:45,520
I made history.

10992
07:57:45,560 --> 07:57:46,440
I killed a president.

10993
07:57:46,700 --> 07:57:47,760
An ex-president.

10994
07:57:47,880 --> 07:57:48,760
What kind of things?

10995
07:57:49,140 --> 07:57:50,260
About the environment.

10996
07:57:50,660 --> 07:57:51,440
Our ideas.

10997
07:57:51,700 --> 07:57:52,640
Our culture.

10998
07:57:53,760 --> 07:57:54,320
Poetry.

10999
07:57:56,020 --> 07:57:56,700
Compassion.

11000
07:57:56,700 --> 07:57:57,380
Sorrow.

11001
07:57:57,580 --> 07:57:58,240
Joy.

11002
07:57:58,600 --> 07:57:59,800
Oh, sorrow and joy.

11003
07:57:59,800 --> 07:58:01,300
We'll tell them everything together.

11004
07:58:01,880 --> 07:58:04,220
Is that a...proposal?

11005
07:58:04,520 --> 07:58:08,460
This is for your ears only.

11006
07:58:08,940 --> 07:58:09,280
Yay!

11007
07:58:17,020 --> 07:58:17,700
Rizden.

11008
07:58:20,440 --> 07:58:21,600
Oh my gosh.

11009
07:58:34,680 --> 07:58:35,500
Don't worry.

11010
07:58:35,640 --> 07:58:36,520
There's still more to go.

11011
07:58:37,480 --> 07:58:38,900
There's still more talking.

11012
07:58:43,650 --> 07:58:45,310
Oh wait, it's after the credits.

11013
07:58:45,430 --> 07:58:45,890
Just kidding.

11014
07:58:48,470 --> 07:58:49,250
Um...

11015
07:58:50,730 --> 07:58:51,510
Yippee!

11016
07:58:55,580 --> 07:58:59,870
What am I made of?

11017
07:59:02,930 --> 07:59:06,020
Am I full of sorrow?

11018
07:59:06,380 --> 07:59:09,320
Am I hurt and pain?

11019
07:59:10,220 --> 07:59:16,380
Or am I filled with love?

11020
07:59:16,880 --> 07:59:17,760
Yay!

11021
07:59:18,000 --> 07:59:19,580
Kojima and Tomokazu Fukushima!

11022
07:59:19,840 --> 07:59:20,060
Yeah!

11023
07:59:20,160 --> 07:59:21,140
Tomokazu Fukushima!

11024
07:59:21,760 --> 07:59:22,520
Yeah!

11025
07:59:22,600 --> 07:59:23,560
Tomokazu Fukushima!

11026
07:59:35,720 --> 07:59:36,600
Yeah!

11027
07:59:36,600 --> 07:59:37,820
Fukushima-san!

11028
07:59:37,980 --> 07:59:38,900
Thank you for...

11029
07:59:39,620 --> 07:59:41,800
Thank you for guiding Kojima.

11030
07:59:43,840 --> 07:59:44,280
Thank you.

11031
07:59:44,280 --> 07:59:45,380
Love watching your playthroughs every time.

11032
07:59:45,460 --> 07:59:46,060
Thank you!

11033
07:59:48,400 --> 07:59:48,840
Bye.

11034
07:59:50,100 --> 07:59:52,340
Okay, after the credits.

11035
07:59:52,880 --> 07:59:54,660
After we get back to the main...

11036
07:59:55,320 --> 07:59:59,380
The main menu, I'll explain for people who are like, I don't know what's happening.

11037
07:59:59,520 --> 07:59:59,980
I'm so confused.

11038
08:00:00,640 --> 08:00:02,780
Killed the ex-president and was assaulted by the current president.

11039
08:00:03,020 --> 08:00:04,020
Who can top that?

11040
08:00:05,640 --> 08:00:08,120
M was there for the current president's death too!

11041
08:00:08,800 --> 08:00:09,820
What a grim Reaper.

11042
08:00:10,660 --> 08:00:11,780
Thanks for playing one of the best games.

11043
08:00:11,780 --> 08:00:13,920
The best Metal Gear games I have loved.

11044
08:00:14,020 --> 08:00:15,780
I wonder where that Plissken fellow went.

11045
08:00:16,000 --> 08:00:16,860
I miss him too.

11046
08:00:17,460 --> 08:00:18,400
Yeah, me too.

11047
08:00:41,860 --> 08:00:44,580
Out of the MGS game songs, where would you rate this one?

11048
08:00:44,680 --> 08:00:46,000
Better than the best is yet to come?

11049
08:00:49,280 --> 08:00:51,940
They each make me feel something different, you know?

11050
08:00:53,500 --> 08:00:55,880
I love this one because I just really love jazz.

11051
08:00:56,240 --> 08:00:57,640
But it also just makes me... I don't know.

11052
08:00:57,680 --> 08:01:01,500
Each game's theme song makes me feel something different.

11053
08:01:07,190 --> 08:01:09,050
This song and the feels... I know.

11054
08:01:18,920 --> 08:01:20,640
But I really do love this one a lot.

11055
08:01:24,040 --> 08:01:24,480
I

11056
08:01:28,920 --> 08:01:31,320
put it above Heaven's Divide, but not Calling to the Night.

11057
08:01:32,200 --> 08:01:33,900
I really do like Calling to the Night.

11058
08:01:35,440 --> 08:01:36,580
A lot, a lot.

11059
08:01:48,440 --> 08:01:51,560
I think, like, 1 and 2's themes...

11060
08:01:54,360 --> 08:01:55,640
I don't want to say themes.

11061
08:01:55,740 --> 08:01:56,200
Like, they're songs.

11062
08:01:58,540 --> 08:02:00,760
Really make me feel, like, this nostalgia.

11063
08:02:01,560 --> 08:02:03,500
Are free.

11064
08:02:06,530 --> 08:02:09,500
Little sounds of laughter.

11065
08:02:10,490 --> 08:02:11,820
A warm hug.

11066
08:02:12,260 --> 08:02:13,320
A smile.

11067
08:02:14,080 --> 08:02:15,260
A kiss.

11068
08:02:16,480 --> 08:02:19,740
From you to me.

11069
08:02:21,340 --> 08:02:24,280
I've fallen tiny.

11070
08:02:25,150 --> 08:02:27,120
Again, they all make me feel something different.

11071
08:02:27,620 --> 08:02:28,980
I cry and I cry.

11072
08:02:29,640 --> 08:02:30,660
Lost.

11073
08:02:34,170 --> 08:02:34,870
Me, Bob.

11074
08:02:42,110 --> 08:02:43,150
This day.

11075
08:02:43,270 --> 08:02:44,870
For a while.

11076
08:02:45,450 --> 08:02:46,510
Chris Zimmerman!

11077
08:02:47,070 --> 08:02:47,370
Yeah!

11078
08:02:49,130 --> 08:02:51,550
Voice-over director Chris Zimmerman!

11079
08:02:51,930 --> 08:02:54,130
She is such a genius at directing.

11080
08:02:54,130 --> 08:02:54,810
My god.

11081
08:02:55,190 --> 08:03:00,210
Say goodbye to yesterday, my friend.

11082
08:03:00,790 --> 08:03:01,590
Yippee!

11083
08:03:01,850 --> 08:03:02,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

11084
08:03:04,770 --> 08:03:06,270
Chris the goat.

11085
08:03:07,670 --> 08:03:10,010
And her husband is awesome.

11086
08:03:10,010 --> 08:03:10,930
I miss a lot.

11087
08:03:13,190 --> 08:03:13,830
Yeah, yeah.

11088
08:03:18,080 --> 08:03:19,040
Patrick Zimmerman.

11089
08:03:24,580 --> 08:03:25,060
Revolver.

11090
08:03:25,540 --> 08:03:26,460
Power couple.

11091
08:03:28,520 --> 08:03:29,520
Oh, ex-husband!

11092
08:03:29,580 --> 08:03:30,340
So, I'm so sorry.

11093
08:03:32,140 --> 08:03:32,860
My bad.

11094
08:03:34,260 --> 08:03:35,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11095
08:03:46,790 --> 08:03:47,270
Anyway.

11096
08:03:48,610 --> 08:03:49,210
Yesterday.

11097
08:03:56,600 --> 08:03:57,900
Double-crossed again.

11098
08:03:58,620 --> 08:03:59,860
No, no, no.

11099
08:04:00,300 --> 08:04:02,640
Planning, game design, Hideo Kojima!

11100
08:04:02,920 --> 08:04:03,680
Yoji Shinkawa!

11101
08:04:03,920 --> 08:04:04,100
Yeah!

11102
08:04:04,320 --> 08:04:05,000
Yoji Shinkawa!

11103
08:04:05,620 --> 08:04:06,620
Tomokazu Fukushima!

11104
08:04:06,880 --> 08:04:07,180
Yeah!

11105
08:04:07,520 --> 08:04:09,220
Look at all those people in the script.

11106
08:04:10,420 --> 08:04:11,020
Crazy.

11107
08:04:11,260 --> 08:04:12,060
Crazy, crazy.

11108
08:04:14,180 --> 08:04:15,840
And what a crazy script it is.

11109
08:04:17,240 --> 08:04:18,600
What a crazy script!

11110
08:04:18,600 --> 08:04:20,420
It is.

11111
08:04:20,880 --> 08:04:21,940
So crazy.

11112
08:04:29,010 --> 08:04:30,150
Nakagawa Shoko?

11113
08:04:31,190 --> 08:04:33,090
Not like Shokotan, right?

11114
08:04:33,330 --> 08:04:33,750
No.

11115
08:04:37,070 --> 08:04:37,830
No.

11116
08:04:40,250 --> 08:04:41,010
Right?

11117
08:04:41,250 --> 08:04:41,310
No.

11118
08:04:41,390 --> 08:04:42,370
Skateboarding theme!

11119
08:04:42,710 --> 08:04:42,750
Yeah!

11120
08:04:45,550 --> 08:04:46,310
Wait.

11121
08:04:49,210 --> 08:04:49,970
It...

11122
08:04:49,970 --> 08:04:51,990
Wait, is it actually Shokotan?

11123
08:04:52,110 --> 08:04:52,250
No.

11124
08:04:52,250 --> 08:04:52,430
Wait.

11125
08:04:53,150 --> 08:04:54,150
I don't think so.

11126
08:04:55,310 --> 08:04:56,190
What year?

11127
08:04:57,670 --> 08:04:58,550
Ghost Babble.

11128
08:04:58,590 --> 08:05:00,490
Wait, I don't remember seeing a Ghost Babble poster.

11129
08:05:01,670 --> 08:05:02,290
Oh wait.

11130
08:05:02,950 --> 08:05:04,030
Was it in the...

11131
08:05:04,030 --> 08:05:05,090
Was it in the...

11132
08:05:10,510 --> 08:05:10,950
The...

11133
08:05:12,050 --> 08:05:13,590
Yeah, she would have been really young.

11134
08:05:13,830 --> 08:05:14,230
Yeah.

11135
08:05:15,010 --> 08:05:17,250
Cause she's in like her mid-thirties now, I believe.

11136
08:05:18,530 --> 08:05:19,590
This game came out what?

11137
08:05:19,610 --> 08:05:19,970
2001?

11138
08:05:21,030 --> 08:05:21,470
Yeah.

11139
08:05:21,750 --> 08:05:22,230
I don't know.

11140
08:05:22,230 --> 08:05:23,070
I think she would have been too young.

11141
08:05:25,430 --> 08:05:26,490
That's a funny...

11142
08:05:27,850 --> 08:05:28,730
Funny, uh...

11143
08:05:30,370 --> 08:05:30,810
Coinkydinkto.

11144
08:05:34,520 --> 08:05:35,240
Congrats Minto!

11145
08:05:35,520 --> 08:05:39,120
Seven hours of grinding through some struggles you pushed your way through frustration and finished it today!

11146
08:05:39,340 --> 08:05:39,500
Yippee!

11147
08:05:40,180 --> 08:05:41,480
Thanks for another awesome MGM stream!

11148
08:05:41,620 --> 08:05:42,020
Thank you!

11149
08:05:48,760 --> 08:05:49,200
Okay.

11150
08:05:50,600 --> 08:05:51,840
Let's finish it up.

11151
08:05:51,980 --> 08:05:53,180
Let's finish it up.

11152
08:05:54,260 --> 08:05:56,340
Ah, this song is so good.

11153
08:05:58,340 --> 08:06:00,280
Rose is real and Raiden had a girlfriend.

11154
08:06:00,500 --> 08:06:02,320
That's the most unbelievable part.

11155
08:06:02,840 --> 08:06:05,220
I mean, he's a good looking guy.

11156
08:06:05,320 --> 08:06:07,740
He's just gotta work on his personality.

11157
08:06:18,720 --> 08:06:19,160
Memes!

11158
08:06:26,360 --> 08:06:28,480
These are the things I will pass on.

11159
08:06:29,100 --> 08:06:30,400
That's what I live for.

11160
08:06:30,560 --> 08:06:41,000
We need to pass the torch and let our children read our messy and sad history by its light.

11161
08:06:43,540 --> 08:06:46,720
We have all the magic of the digital age to do that with.

11162
08:06:49,520 --> 08:06:55,100
The human race will probably come to an end sometime and new species may rule over this planet.

11163
08:06:56,340 --> 08:07:02,120
The Earth may not be forever, but we still have the responsibility to leave what traces of life we can.

11164
08:07:03,260 --> 08:07:07,860
Building the future and keeping the past alive are one and the same thing.

11165
08:07:08,260 --> 08:07:09,620
He's so awesome.

11166
08:07:10,480 --> 08:07:11,720
He's so wise.

11167
08:07:11,880 --> 08:07:12,440
Snake.

11168
08:07:12,560 --> 08:07:13,300
Solid snake.

11169
08:07:15,060 --> 08:07:16,440
The squirrels will rule.

11170
08:07:18,300 --> 08:07:21,000
Is this implying the squirrels will inherit the Earth?

11171
08:07:28,000 --> 08:07:29,200
One second.

11172
08:07:31,960 --> 08:07:33,320
Snake, you there?

11173
08:07:33,940 --> 08:07:34,560
It's me.

11174
08:07:34,780 --> 08:07:36,540
I've finished going over that disk.

11175
08:07:37,060 --> 08:07:38,820
Did you find the Patriot's List?

11176
08:07:39,280 --> 08:07:40,100
Of course.

11177
08:07:40,340 --> 08:07:43,080
It contains the personal data of 12 people.

11178
08:07:43,460 --> 08:07:44,840
There was a name on it.

11179
08:07:45,020 --> 08:07:47,280
Snake, it was one of our biggest contributors.

11180
08:07:47,980 --> 08:07:49,400
What's going on around here?

11181
08:07:49,740 --> 08:07:50,500
I don't know.

11182
08:07:50,920 --> 08:07:52,560
Anyway, where are they?

11183
08:07:52,800 --> 08:07:55,440
Well, we were right about them being on Manhattan, but...

11184
08:07:55,440 --> 08:07:56,120
But what?

11185
08:07:56,660 --> 08:07:57,800
They're already dead.

11186
08:07:58,000 --> 08:07:59,240
All 12 of them.

11187
08:07:59,420 --> 08:07:59,660
What?

11188
08:07:59,660 --> 08:08:00,320
When did it happen?

11189
08:08:00,540 --> 08:08:03,840
Well, about a hundred years ago.

11190
08:08:04,560 --> 08:08:07,060
What the hell?

11191
08:08:07,280 --> 08:08:08,740
What the hell?

11192
08:08:09,520 --> 08:08:11,200
Oh my god.

11193
08:08:11,720 --> 08:08:21,730
Wow, I saved and continued the same amount of times.

11194
08:08:22,390 --> 08:08:25,070
I killed 72 persons!

11195
08:08:25,690 --> 08:08:28,950
But I only alerted 16 times.

11196
08:08:29,690 --> 08:08:30,830
It's not so bad.

11197
08:08:33,610 --> 08:08:34,890
I've already done that a lot of times.

11198
08:08:40,430 --> 08:08:43,370
Suwako, wait, you could call an emergency man.

11199
08:08:43,570 --> 08:08:43,750
Bye, beaut.

11200
08:08:48,940 --> 08:08:51,120
When would they leave this mothership?

11201
08:08:51,400 --> 08:08:54,420
By the time I just left this place, they'd left.

11202
08:08:54,420 --> 08:08:54,600
I don't trust you.

11203
08:08:54,600 --> 08:08:54,640
I know what's going on down there.

11204
08:08:54,660 --> 08:08:54,940
Bye, beaut.

11205
08:09:03,440 --> 08:09:04,720
legislative order.

11206
08:09:04,720 --> 08:09:04,780
No one wants to know what's going to happen at the computing lab.

11207
08:09:04,780 --> 08:09:05,200
Nice.

11208
08:09:08,080 --> 08:09:08,980
What did I get?

11209
08:09:09,200 --> 08:09:09,580
Yay!

11210
08:09:09,700 --> 08:09:10,460
I got the camera!

11211
08:09:16,290 --> 08:09:16,810
Yube!

11212
08:09:16,810 --> 08:09:17,070
Yube!

11213
08:09:24,810 --> 08:09:25,330
Yay!

11214
08:09:25,330 --> 08:09:27,090
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

11215
08:09:28,610 --> 08:09:29,390
Yay!

11216
08:09:44,650 --> 08:09:47,600
And now the screen changes to Raidu.

11217
08:09:50,080 --> 08:09:55,900
God, this music, this title music is so...

11218
08:09:55,900 --> 08:09:59,680
It sets the tone of the game so well.

11219
08:10:00,000 --> 08:10:01,100
Oh my god.

11220
08:10:01,320 --> 08:10:02,900
I love MGS2!

11221
08:10:02,940 --> 08:10:03,860
MGS2 so much!

11222
08:10:04,740 --> 08:10:07,780
I'm going to press the start button though so we don't loop through the...

11223
08:10:07,780 --> 08:10:08,760
Oh my gosh, Raid!

11224
08:10:09,360 --> 08:10:10,740
I never noticed him there.

11225
08:10:10,860 --> 08:10:11,980
Unless he wasn't there before.

11226
08:10:12,160 --> 08:10:12,540
I don't know.

11227
08:10:15,520 --> 08:10:16,860
Such a good game.

11228
08:10:17,600 --> 08:10:18,400
So good.

11229
08:10:18,960 --> 08:10:23,440
Freaky Elephant sounds like an MGSV codename for a random guy you recruit.

11230
08:10:27,240 --> 08:10:27,720
Truly.

11231
08:10:29,180 --> 08:10:29,820
So yeah.

11232
08:10:30,520 --> 08:10:32,920
The end of the game is pretty wacky, huh?

11233
08:10:33,740 --> 08:10:36,100
There were some people maybe who...

11234
08:10:36,100 --> 08:10:37,580
Sorry it took so long.

11235
08:10:37,720 --> 08:10:40,220
The ending cutscenes are so, so long.

11236
08:10:41,100 --> 08:10:45,320
Some people who are just like watching for the first time and are just like, I'm so confused.

11237
08:10:46,680 --> 08:10:47,720
So basically...

11238
08:10:48,460 --> 08:10:51,000
From what we learned in this game...

11239
08:10:52,340 --> 08:10:55,480
Solidus had this thing called the S3 plan.

11240
08:10:55,980 --> 08:10:59,040
In which he was training child soldiers...

11241
08:10:59,040 --> 08:11:00,900
To try and become...

11242
08:11:00,900 --> 08:11:01,920
Like...

11243
08:11:02,460 --> 08:11:02,900
Solid...

11244
08:11:02,900 --> 08:11:03,280
Like...

11245
08:11:03,280 --> 08:11:04,320
To become...

11246
08:11:04,320 --> 08:11:05,420
Like a solid snake.

11247
08:11:05,640 --> 08:11:06,020
Right?

11248
08:11:08,140 --> 08:11:10,900
They want to see if people can become...

11249
08:11:14,520 --> 08:11:14,960
Like...

11250
08:11:15,560 --> 08:11:16,000
Oh.

11251
08:11:16,720 --> 08:11:17,400
Wait, what?

11252
08:11:17,660 --> 08:11:18,440
Yeah, mini snakes.

11253
08:11:18,620 --> 08:11:19,640
They all wanted little...

11254
08:11:19,640 --> 08:11:20,520
Or the Patriots.

11255
08:11:20,660 --> 08:11:21,100
Sorry.

11256
08:11:22,040 --> 08:11:22,920
Well, solid...

11257
08:11:22,920 --> 08:11:23,280
Okay, hold on.

11258
08:11:23,440 --> 08:11:25,880
Sorry, my brain is so mush right now.

11259
08:11:26,600 --> 08:11:27,480
Okay, so...

11260
08:11:27,480 --> 08:11:28,200
Hold on.

11261
08:11:28,860 --> 08:11:31,080
Because there were multiple S3 plans, you know?

11262
08:11:31,080 --> 08:11:32,800
There were multiple S3 plans.

11263
08:11:33,180 --> 08:11:34,900
Everybody had their own, basically.

11264
08:11:36,940 --> 08:11:39,480
Everybody had their own S3 plan, you guys.

11265
08:11:40,060 --> 08:11:41,100
Because they already...

11266
08:11:41,100 --> 08:11:42,160
They all talked about it.

11267
08:11:43,180 --> 08:11:44,140
Ocelot had one.

11268
08:11:44,200 --> 08:11:45,120
Solidus had one.

11269
08:11:45,260 --> 08:11:47,000
And the Patriots had one.

11270
08:11:48,640 --> 08:11:49,200
So...

11271
08:11:50,000 --> 08:11:51,060
That's why it's kind of weird.

11272
08:11:54,540 --> 08:11:55,100
And...

11273
08:11:56,720 --> 08:11:57,280
And...

11274
08:11:57,940 --> 08:11:58,840
Do you have one?

11275
08:12:02,780 --> 08:12:03,400
Hmm...

11276
08:12:03,400 --> 08:12:05,000
What would my S3 plan be?

11277
08:12:06,800 --> 08:12:07,420
Hmm...

11278
08:12:08,420 --> 08:12:10,520
Does Olga's baby have one?

11279
08:12:10,680 --> 08:12:11,140
Yeah.

11280
08:12:11,560 --> 08:12:13,120
Olga's baby had one.

11281
08:12:13,780 --> 08:12:16,100
I think everybody should have an S3 plan.

11282
08:12:17,380 --> 08:12:21,300
Everybody, start feeding your children gunpowder.

11283
08:12:21,400 --> 08:12:21,660
Okay?

11284
08:12:22,100 --> 08:12:23,660
Super sexy snakes.

11285
08:12:26,820 --> 08:12:28,100
Yeah, basically.

11286
08:12:28,760 --> 08:12:31,060
But anyway, Solidus was raising his little girl.

11287
08:12:31,060 --> 08:12:33,060
And he wanted his child soldiers to become...

11288
08:12:34,220 --> 08:12:35,160
You know?

11289
08:12:36,000 --> 08:12:36,320
Powerful?

11290
08:12:36,980 --> 08:12:38,780
And if they could become...

11291
08:12:38,780 --> 08:12:41,860
You know, if they're raised in a certain condition, if they can become...

11292
08:12:41,860 --> 08:12:42,680
Like...

11293
08:12:42,680 --> 08:12:43,080
Snake?

11294
08:12:44,680 --> 08:12:45,320
And...

11295
08:12:47,000 --> 08:12:50,980
Then Ocelot was just like, Actually, I double-crossed you.

11296
08:12:52,100 --> 08:12:52,740
And...

11297
08:12:52,740 --> 08:12:54,000
And...

11298
08:12:54,780 --> 08:12:56,760
Solidus' thing was just like...

11299
08:12:56,760 --> 08:12:57,140
Yeah...

11300
08:12:57,140 --> 08:12:57,600
Yeah.

11301
08:12:57,720 --> 08:12:59,400
Raised in certain conditions...

11302
08:12:59,400 --> 08:13:02,600
And Ocelot was like, actually, I double-crossed you.

11303
08:13:02,680 --> 08:13:05,600
This whole video game was my S3 plan.

11304
08:13:07,560 --> 08:13:16,300
And actually, the whole big shell was the S3 plan, because it was exactly like Shadow Moses!

11305
08:13:16,960 --> 08:13:23,020
And then the Patriots' S3 plan is just like... what?

11306
08:13:23,920 --> 08:13:27,420
It's the sanity thing.

11307
08:13:27,620 --> 08:13:29,280
I don't even know how to describe it.

11308
08:13:29,400 --> 08:13:32,220
Where does the White House soup come in?

11309
08:13:32,300 --> 08:13:33,860
The primordial soup.

11310
08:13:35,080 --> 08:13:38,360
Yeah, nature versus nurture, then mind control.

11311
08:13:39,420 --> 08:13:41,000
Their sanity plan.

11312
08:13:43,420 --> 08:13:48,640
But we find out that basically...

11313
08:13:50,580 --> 08:13:56,780
Colonel the whole time was part of this program called GW, which is part of the Patriots.

11314
08:13:57,520 --> 08:13:58,200
And...

11315
08:13:59,640 --> 08:14:07,880
is this AI that... the Patriots are like this overseeing AI or group of people that...

11316
08:14:08,700 --> 08:14:13,980
that are able to control everything, I guess, in the world.

11317
08:14:14,080 --> 08:14:20,220
And what they really want is, because the digital age is rising, they want to control digital media.

11318
08:14:20,320 --> 08:14:29,040
Before they were able to control stuff, but now that digital stuff is becoming more prominent, they were like, we must control the digital media as well!

11319
08:14:29,400 --> 08:14:29,520
So...

11320
08:14:30,760 --> 08:14:32,920
I don't think Mint knows what she's saying.

11321
08:14:33,040 --> 08:14:33,200
What?

11322
08:14:33,380 --> 08:14:34,500
What are you talking about?

11323
08:14:37,840 --> 08:14:39,580
I know what I'm talking about!

11324
08:14:41,680 --> 08:14:43,520
They want to moderate Twitter.

11325
08:14:43,720 --> 08:14:45,580
Yes, they want to moderate Twitter.

11326
08:14:49,420 --> 08:14:49,940
And...

11327
08:14:53,500 --> 08:14:54,020
And...

11328
08:14:56,320 --> 08:15:01,440
So Raiden, from just being a little baby, he was always basically just...

11329
08:15:01,440 --> 08:15:03,440
He never was able to make his own decisions.

11330
08:15:03,480 --> 08:15:07,140
And he thought that falling in love with Rose was his own decision.

11331
08:15:07,180 --> 08:15:08,500
And no, she was a plant!

11332
08:15:08,960 --> 08:15:10,740
And she does actually exist.

11333
08:15:11,440 --> 08:15:11,920
But...

11334
08:15:12,640 --> 08:15:18,700
The Rose at the very end, when she's like talking, going back and forth with the Colonel, that's AI Rose.

11335
08:15:18,820 --> 08:15:19,640
She's not real.

11336
08:15:19,880 --> 08:15:22,680
But up until then, she's real, you know?

11337
08:15:22,680 --> 08:15:24,800
But he can do flips!

11338
08:15:35,400 --> 08:15:36,980
Wasn't Rose AI the whole time?

11339
08:15:37,160 --> 08:15:38,060
No, I don't think so.

11340
08:15:38,360 --> 08:15:40,640
I thought she was only AI at the very end.

11341
08:15:42,040 --> 08:15:42,960
I mean...

11342
08:15:42,960 --> 08:15:44,020
If so...

11343
08:15:44,020 --> 08:15:46,820
They trained that AI so well.

11344
08:15:48,220 --> 08:15:50,840
They made that AI insufferable.

11345
08:15:53,780 --> 08:15:56,320
Yeah, real Rose is cut off after she says she's pregnant.

11346
08:15:56,320 --> 08:15:57,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11347
08:15:57,540 --> 08:15:59,080
She's real up until that point.

11348
08:16:00,120 --> 08:16:01,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11349
08:16:04,580 --> 08:16:05,460
And so...

11350
08:16:06,560 --> 08:16:07,000
Yeah.

11351
08:16:09,580 --> 08:16:10,620
That's basically it.

11352
08:16:10,820 --> 08:16:11,580
That's really it.

11353
08:16:12,960 --> 08:16:14,240
Solidus was just like, no!

11354
08:16:15,060 --> 08:16:16,200
I want to...

11355
08:16:16,200 --> 08:16:17,720
I want to be remembered!

11356
08:16:19,380 --> 08:16:22,200
So he didn't want to be erased by the Patriots.

11357
08:16:22,580 --> 08:16:23,660
Essentially, I guess.

11358
08:16:23,840 --> 08:16:24,260
I don't know.

11359
08:16:24,680 --> 08:16:25,480
And so...

11360
08:16:25,480 --> 08:16:27,260
He was like, down with the Patriots!

11361
08:16:29,080 --> 08:16:29,520
And...

11362
08:16:31,260 --> 08:16:32,520
Am I real?

11363
08:16:34,420 --> 08:16:35,740
Does GW win?

11364
08:16:37,820 --> 08:16:38,700
I mean...

11365
08:16:39,300 --> 08:16:40,340
At the end of this?

11366
08:16:40,380 --> 08:16:40,940
Kind of, yeah.

11367
08:16:42,240 --> 08:16:44,340
GW does kind of win at the end of this.

11368
08:16:46,980 --> 08:16:51,440
The Patriots got what they wanted because they wanted Solidus dead.

11369
08:16:51,600 --> 08:16:52,580
And they got it.

11370
08:16:57,030 --> 08:16:58,990
But they had the virus in them.

11371
08:16:59,170 --> 08:16:59,570
So...

11372
08:17:00,350 --> 08:17:01,030
You know.

11373
08:17:05,050 --> 08:17:06,070
They had the virus...

11374
08:17:06,070 --> 08:17:09,010
The virus was kind of like, seeping through them.

11375
08:17:10,350 --> 08:17:10,830
So...

11376
08:17:11,610 --> 08:17:12,090
Yeah.

11377
08:17:12,170 --> 08:17:13,150
But there's other Patriots.

11378
08:17:13,790 --> 08:17:14,170
So...

11379
08:17:15,730 --> 08:17:17,670
They proved the S3 plan could work.

11380
08:17:17,810 --> 08:17:19,030
I know.

11381
08:17:19,110 --> 08:17:19,890
We're all just...

11382
08:17:19,890 --> 08:17:21,470
We're all just pawns.

11383
08:17:21,850 --> 08:17:23,650
And the Patriots was planned.

11384
08:17:23,770 --> 08:17:24,870
So if anything bad...

11385
08:17:24,870 --> 08:17:26,290
Bad ever happens to you...

11386
08:17:26,830 --> 08:17:27,690
Don't blame yourself.

11387
08:17:27,990 --> 08:17:29,370
Blame the Patriots.

11388
08:17:31,630 --> 08:17:33,030
Blame the Patriots.

11389
08:17:33,090 --> 08:17:34,230
For it's their fault.

11390
08:17:40,680 --> 08:17:42,440
I don't understand but pog.

11391
08:17:43,480 --> 08:17:43,960
What?

11392
08:17:44,100 --> 08:17:44,540
How?

11393
08:17:44,660 --> 08:17:46,140
I don't know how much easily...

11394
08:17:46,140 --> 08:17:48,480
How much more easily I can explain it to be honest.

11395
08:17:50,020 --> 08:17:52,900
Why did they say that the Patriots died a hundred years ago though?

11396
08:17:53,460 --> 08:17:53,940
Well...

11397
08:17:53,940 --> 08:17:56,860
We'll have to play the other games to find out.

11398
08:17:57,140 --> 08:17:58,040
It's a mystery.

11399
08:18:05,890 --> 08:18:08,090
This is why we need the MJS podcast?

11400
08:18:08,550 --> 08:18:08,710
No.

11401
08:18:13,990 --> 08:18:16,870
Explain in the form of a caffeinated karaoke stream.

11402
08:18:17,110 --> 08:18:17,710
I need...

11403
08:18:17,710 --> 08:18:19,430
Actually I don't need any caffeine right now.

11404
08:18:19,470 --> 08:18:19,930
I'm ready.

11405
08:18:20,070 --> 08:18:20,570
I'm like...

11406
08:18:20,570 --> 08:18:21,550
My eyes are droopy.

11407
08:18:24,070 --> 08:18:26,470
Patriots are basically the physical embodiment of the memes.

11408
08:18:27,030 --> 08:18:28,090
That's what they meant by...

11409
08:18:28,090 --> 08:18:29,490
They are American culture.

11410
08:18:30,210 --> 08:18:31,150
They're the memes.

11411
08:18:32,550 --> 08:18:35,330
Was the Colonel at any point part of the Patriots?

11412
08:18:36,150 --> 08:18:36,670
Like...

11413
08:18:36,670 --> 08:18:37,510
The Colonel...

11414
08:18:37,510 --> 08:18:38,850
The Colonel in this game?

11415
08:18:39,730 --> 08:18:42,730
The Colonel in this game the entire time was GW.

11416
08:18:45,030 --> 08:18:47,350
Are you playing MJS 3 on PS2?

11417
08:18:47,870 --> 08:18:48,390
Yeah.

11418
08:18:48,430 --> 08:18:48,850
Oh yes.

11419
08:18:49,010 --> 08:18:49,750
I am actually.

11420
08:18:49,990 --> 08:18:51,270
I will be playing...

11421
08:18:52,490 --> 08:18:53,010
Subsistence.

11422
08:18:54,070 --> 08:18:54,590
You're...

11423
08:18:54,590 --> 08:18:55,490
So...

11424
08:18:55,490 --> 08:19:00,510
We'll get that hidden cutscene that happens in MJS 3.

11425
08:19:00,770 --> 08:19:02,570
The game within a game.

11426
08:19:05,850 --> 08:19:06,650
Thank you.

11427
08:19:06,730 --> 08:19:06,970
Thank you.

11428
08:19:07,230 --> 08:19:07,650
Bye.

11429
08:19:07,910 --> 08:19:16,150
Something I really love about this game is how the theme of censorship and controlling information is exactly what they did with Raiden and hiding his existence from all commercials and from...

11430
08:19:16,150 --> 08:19:16,550
Whoa!

11431
08:19:17,290 --> 08:19:17,810
Yeah!

11432
08:19:17,910 --> 08:19:18,410
You're right!

11433
08:19:19,790 --> 08:19:20,690
So meta.

11434
08:19:22,230 --> 08:19:24,270
Patriots stressed out and overworked by Oshii.

11435
08:19:24,270 --> 08:19:24,890
Unforgivable.

11436
08:19:31,130 --> 08:19:32,410
But yeah, I'll be playing...

11437
08:19:32,790 --> 08:19:34,570
I'll be playing the PS2 version.

11438
08:19:34,630 --> 08:19:43,630
It's funny because I was just like, oh, if I'm going to be gone in Japan for a whole month and I won't have like my PS2 or anything like that.

11439
08:19:45,090 --> 08:19:47,290
What if I played the 3DS version?

11440
08:19:48,850 --> 08:19:49,250
But...

11441
08:19:49,250 --> 08:19:51,330
The 3DS version of Metal Gear Solid 3.

11442
08:19:51,410 --> 08:19:53,390
But I was like, I don't think I want to put myself through...

11443
08:19:53,390 --> 08:19:56,370
the torture probably.

11444
08:19:56,870 --> 08:20:02,510
Even though Patriot's AI speech is relevant today, I'd say Snake's final speeches are also very important to learn and use in our lives.

11445
08:20:02,670 --> 08:20:03,550
So true!

11446
08:20:04,330 --> 08:20:05,530
Snake is so wise.

11447
08:20:05,910 --> 08:20:06,950
He's so awesome.

11448
08:20:07,230 --> 08:20:08,410
I love Snake.

11449
08:20:16,310 --> 08:20:18,270
Oh my PS2 clock battery!

11450
08:20:18,430 --> 08:20:19,010
Oh, you're right!

11451
08:20:19,310 --> 08:20:20,450
I don't think it's dead.

11452
08:20:21,370 --> 08:20:22,190
I think I'll...

11453
08:20:22,190 --> 08:20:23,370
I'm just gonna probably put it...

11454
08:20:23,370 --> 08:20:25,210
on like a random date and see what happens.

11455
08:20:25,470 --> 08:20:32,750
I think it's getting mixed up because it's going back and forth between 1999 and 2000.

11456
08:20:33,230 --> 08:20:33,870
It's kind of weird.

11457
08:20:39,820 --> 08:20:41,120
Snake is very philosophical.

11458
08:20:41,580 --> 08:20:42,060
I know!

11459
08:20:42,540 --> 08:20:44,280
Solid Snake is like really...

11460
08:20:44,280 --> 08:20:45,900
He's such a good person.

11461
08:20:46,060 --> 08:20:46,840
I love that guy.

11462
08:21:03,110 --> 08:21:04,150
I'm so tired.

11463
08:21:06,270 --> 08:21:08,150
I wish I was tired.

11464
08:21:08,610 --> 08:21:09,010
Yay!

11465
08:21:09,170 --> 08:21:09,850
We did it!

11466
08:21:10,050 --> 08:21:10,610
We did it!

11467
08:21:11,130 --> 08:21:11,530
Yippee!

11468
08:21:13,390 --> 08:21:13,790
Yippee!

11469
08:21:13,990 --> 08:21:15,150
Metal Gear Solid 2!

11470
08:21:17,570 --> 08:21:20,610
I was wondering if I'd be able to do it today, but I was like, I don't know.

11471
08:21:21,110 --> 08:21:23,690
There's really not that much left of the game after...

11472
08:21:23,690 --> 08:21:25,310
from where we were at, you know?

11473
08:21:25,510 --> 08:21:25,910
So...

11474
08:21:29,110 --> 08:21:30,750
This weekend is Otakuthon.

11475
08:21:31,090 --> 08:21:32,070
So I will be there.

11476
08:21:32,290 --> 08:21:32,690
So...

11477
08:21:33,510 --> 08:21:34,130
A bit of...

11478
08:21:34,130 --> 08:21:35,430
A bit of a shorter streaming week.

11479
08:21:36,510 --> 08:21:37,590
I'm so sorry.

11480
08:21:37,710 --> 08:21:39,950
My streams are all...

11481
08:21:40,790 --> 08:21:42,510
Everything is so whack lately.

11482
08:21:43,130 --> 08:21:49,830
And then as soon as I get back from Otakuthon, I am going straight to Japan.

11483
08:21:50,570 --> 08:21:52,150
So it's kind of...

11484
08:21:52,150 --> 08:21:53,970
But I will be bringing all my stuff.

11485
08:21:54,630 --> 08:21:56,110
And I will be streaming in Japan.

11486
08:21:56,390 --> 08:21:57,610
And I have checked...

11487
08:21:58,910 --> 08:21:59,750
I've double...

11488
08:21:59,750 --> 08:22:00,990
Triple-checked my hotels.

11489
08:22:01,330 --> 08:22:02,890
I will be able to stream there.

11490
08:22:03,070 --> 08:22:03,590
So...

11491
08:22:04,950 --> 08:22:05,870
Yes, yes, yes.

11492
08:22:06,370 --> 08:22:08,030
It's going to be my first con ever.

11493
08:22:08,230 --> 08:22:08,670
Oh my gosh!

11494
08:22:08,810 --> 08:22:09,450
So exciting!

11495
08:22:09,730 --> 08:22:10,350
Thank you!

11496
08:22:11,370 --> 08:22:12,250
Thanks for going.

11497
08:22:13,310 --> 08:22:16,450
Congrats with you with finishing one of my favorite MGS games.

11498
08:22:16,550 --> 08:22:19,110
I can still remember screaming like a monkey when Raiden got the sword.

11499
08:22:20,230 --> 08:22:22,190
I wish the sword never happened.

11500
08:22:23,010 --> 08:22:23,490
So...

11501
08:22:26,830 --> 08:22:28,010
It's so icky.

11502
08:22:29,630 --> 08:22:31,770
It's the hottest summer in recent years in Japan.

11503
08:22:31,890 --> 08:22:32,330
Good luck.

11504
08:22:32,530 --> 08:22:32,750
Ugh.

11505
08:22:33,690 --> 08:22:34,310
It's okay.

11506
08:22:34,410 --> 08:22:34,790
I'll deal.

11507
08:22:36,350 --> 08:22:40,030
I actually don't know if I'll be going out that much so...

11508
08:22:42,270 --> 08:22:43,210
It's okay though.

11509
08:22:47,410 --> 08:22:48,370
Thank you!

11510
08:22:48,570 --> 08:22:50,570
I'm happy to see one of my all-time favorite games completed.

11511
08:22:51,210 --> 08:22:51,910
Thank you!

11512
08:22:53,710 --> 08:22:55,730
The sword is cool, controlling it...

11513
08:22:55,730 --> 08:22:56,330
Yeah.

11514
08:22:59,350 --> 08:23:00,790
I love hack and slash.

11515
08:23:01,630 --> 08:23:03,770
Once I just started blocking, though, it was great!

11516
08:23:04,170 --> 08:23:12,030
I would block, and then he would block, and then I would block, and then he would block, and then I would block, and then he would block...

11517
08:23:19,570 --> 08:23:24,730
Until MGS4 came out, my friends had a theory that everything after Raiden got knocked out was a fever dream.

11518
08:23:24,850 --> 08:23:26,170
It held for seven years.

11519
08:23:27,590 --> 08:23:31,210
That would then be such a stinky ending, though, right?

11520
08:23:31,450 --> 08:23:32,570
It was all just a dream.

11521
08:23:33,090 --> 08:23:34,890
No, that's the biggest cop-out.

11522
08:23:36,330 --> 08:23:40,330
This is the part where I plug the MGS2 analysis driving off the map.

11523
08:23:40,610 --> 08:23:47,090
It really made me appreciate the game's design choices, and the writer later got to work on MGS4 among some other Metal Gears.

11524
08:23:47,190 --> 08:23:47,330
Oh!

11525
08:23:48,170 --> 08:23:49,470
Thank you, I'll look into it.

11526
08:23:54,170 --> 08:23:55,610
A VR simulation.

11527
08:23:56,830 --> 08:23:58,290
A VR simulation.

11528
08:23:58,490 --> 08:24:00,570
What if we're all just... this is the Matrix.

11529
08:24:05,470 --> 08:24:08,170
Kojima watched the Matrix and was like, Hmm, yeah.

11530
08:24:09,070 --> 08:24:10,110
How about like that?

11531
08:24:13,870 --> 08:24:14,830
Oh, man.

11532
08:24:16,350 --> 08:24:20,050
I think we can canonize I'm bleeding out solidus as a code word.

11533
08:24:20,070 --> 08:24:21,450
A code word for what?

11534
08:24:26,430 --> 08:24:30,130
Raiden didn't avoid drowning and died when trying to enter the Big Shell!

11535
08:24:31,130 --> 08:24:33,250
Oh my gosh, that's a real...

11536
08:24:35,230 --> 08:24:36,750
That's some real...

11537
08:24:38,190 --> 08:24:39,110
Conspiracy theory.

11538
08:24:40,310 --> 08:24:42,330
I'm bleeding out solidus.

11539
08:24:42,330 --> 08:24:43,970
I'm bleeding out for perseverance.

11540
08:24:44,610 --> 08:24:47,910
Anytime you guys are feeling like you're...

11541
08:24:48,650 --> 08:24:50,290
You're about to...

11542
08:24:50,290 --> 08:24:52,410
You don't think you can make it...

11543
08:24:52,410 --> 08:24:53,950
I'm bleeding out solidus.

11544
08:24:54,130 --> 08:24:54,570
Hoo-ha!

11545
08:24:54,570 --> 08:24:56,350
I'm bleeding out solidus.

11546
08:24:56,370 --> 08:24:56,710
Hoo-ha!

11547
08:24:58,850 --> 08:24:59,330
So...

11548
08:24:59,330 --> 08:25:00,850
For this is the run.

11549
08:25:04,390 --> 08:25:10,050
Watching you play this game after having played it myself just barely February this year made me go like...

11550
08:25:10,050 --> 08:25:11,570
Oh, from like...

11551
08:25:13,730 --> 08:25:14,470
From... wait.

11552
08:25:14,610 --> 08:25:15,650
Like to love?

11553
08:25:15,890 --> 08:25:17,690
Because of all the stuff you freak out about.

11554
08:25:19,510 --> 08:25:21,950
It's so easy to freak out about this game.

11555
08:25:22,010 --> 08:25:22,870
It's so great.

11556
08:25:23,210 --> 08:25:23,390
Oh!

11557
08:25:23,390 --> 08:25:26,370
I wish we could have gotten more Jack and Rose drama.

11558
08:25:27,790 --> 08:25:30,770
So blows my mind how much Kojima predicted regarding AI.

11559
08:25:31,050 --> 08:25:31,830
I know, right?

11560
08:25:32,230 --> 08:25:32,710
Censorship.

11561
08:25:33,090 --> 08:25:34,310
So on in the finale.

11562
08:25:34,610 --> 08:25:34,910
Yeah.

11563
08:25:37,410 --> 08:25:38,210
I mean...

11564
08:25:38,210 --> 08:25:39,210
Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

11565
08:25:39,330 --> 08:25:39,990
I guess...

11566
08:25:39,990 --> 08:25:41,330
Back then...

11567
08:25:42,730 --> 08:25:47,310
With the internet being so new, you could probably look at it and be like...

11568
08:25:47,310 --> 08:25:48,170
Well, what if this happens?

11569
08:25:48,410 --> 08:25:48,950
You know, like...

11570
08:25:48,950 --> 08:25:49,770
What if...

11571
08:25:50,750 --> 08:25:52,410
What if people start using...

11572
08:25:52,410 --> 08:25:54,290
The internet in this way?

11573
08:25:57,370 --> 08:25:57,930
Freaky.

11574
08:26:02,490 --> 08:26:03,910
What rank did Mito get?

11575
08:26:04,110 --> 08:26:04,570
I got...

11576
08:26:04,570 --> 08:26:05,890
I got elephant.

11577
08:26:08,030 --> 08:26:08,870
As I...

11578
08:26:08,870 --> 08:26:09,630
As expected.

11579
08:26:11,010 --> 08:26:12,130
I got elephant.

11580
08:26:12,350 --> 08:26:13,990
But I only had 16 alerts.

11581
08:26:15,010 --> 08:26:16,370
I think that's not so bad.

11582
08:26:20,270 --> 08:26:24,410
Patriots, thank you for your service in perfecting the sword blocking simulation.

11583
08:26:25,770 --> 08:26:26,570
Thanks, Avril.

11584
08:26:30,730 --> 08:26:31,210
Okay.

11585
08:26:32,610 --> 08:26:34,710
Well, guys, it's been eight and a half hours.

11586
08:26:35,130 --> 08:26:37,310
Thank you for this fun little endurance stream.

11587
08:26:38,090 --> 08:26:40,930
I'm gonna go now and sign more postcards.

11588
08:26:43,530 --> 08:26:46,350
I'm gonna go sign more postcards and I will catch you later.

11589
08:26:46,350 --> 08:26:46,530
See you guys.

11590
08:26:47,890 --> 08:26:52,050
I will probably make a schedule for this week.

11591
08:26:52,510 --> 08:26:54,370
I will try to make one as...

11592
08:26:54,370 --> 08:26:57,350
I will try to make a schedule while I'm gone as well.

11593
08:26:57,470 --> 08:27:01,150
Maybe not with specific games, but at least with like times and things like that.

11594
08:27:01,650 --> 08:27:02,090
So...

11595
08:27:03,330 --> 08:27:07,230
So that we can have some semblance of normalcy.

11596
08:27:07,550 --> 08:27:13,710
I think next week might have to be mostly no streams.

11597
08:27:14,490 --> 08:27:14,930
Mostly.

11598
08:27:14,930 --> 08:27:17,830
I will try once I'm in Japan and stuff.

11599
08:27:18,050 --> 08:27:19,510
But there's also VEXPO.

11600
08:27:21,490 --> 08:27:22,130
So...

11601
08:27:23,550 --> 08:27:26,290
And the concert with Doki.

11602
08:27:27,270 --> 08:27:27,910
So...

11603
08:27:29,590 --> 08:27:30,230
It's...

11604
08:27:30,890 --> 08:27:34,090
It'll be more outside events than streams, I believe.

11605
08:27:35,710 --> 08:27:39,010
Yeah, I will be attending the conventions from Japan.

11606
08:27:39,230 --> 08:27:39,650
So...

11607
08:27:41,750 --> 08:27:44,810
You might get a really sleepy meantime.

11608
08:27:44,930 --> 08:27:45,170
So...

11609
08:27:48,650 --> 08:27:49,210
Nah...

11610
08:27:50,250 --> 08:27:51,270
I'm so hyped.

11611
08:27:51,350 --> 08:27:52,030
I'm super excited.

11612
08:27:52,950 --> 08:27:53,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11613
08:27:55,850 --> 08:27:56,410
But...

11614
08:27:56,690 --> 08:27:56,970
Once...

11615
08:27:56,970 --> 08:27:58,490
Once things calm down...

11616
08:27:58,490 --> 08:27:59,230
Like I said...

11617
08:27:59,930 --> 08:28:00,850
August is...

11618
08:28:01,610 --> 08:28:02,810
Pretty really crazy.

11619
08:28:04,790 --> 08:28:06,730
But starting September...

11620
08:28:07,530 --> 08:28:09,490
Things seem to slow down a bit.

11621
08:28:09,530 --> 08:28:10,430
I have a few more events.

11622
08:28:10,870 --> 08:28:11,910
That I have planned.

11623
08:28:13,130 --> 08:28:13,690
Um...

11624
08:28:14,930 --> 08:28:16,350
Some outside of the USA.

11625
08:28:17,570 --> 08:28:18,730
And um...

11626
08:28:20,690 --> 08:28:21,270
Uh...

11627
08:28:21,270 --> 08:28:21,770
But...

11628
08:28:21,770 --> 08:28:23,530
I shouldn't be traveling for them.

11629
08:28:23,650 --> 08:28:25,590
So I should still be able to like...

11630
08:28:25,590 --> 08:28:26,390
Be around them.

11631
08:28:26,610 --> 08:28:27,890
And such...

11632
08:28:27,890 --> 08:28:28,630
Hmm...

11633
08:28:28,630 --> 08:28:29,890
Sorry that...

11634
08:28:29,890 --> 08:28:31,410
I overbooked myself.

11635
08:28:34,310 --> 08:28:36,250
My math teacher always said...

11636
08:28:36,250 --> 08:28:37,290
In order to catch an elephant...

11637
08:28:37,290 --> 08:28:38,210
You gotta dig a hole.

11638
08:28:38,710 --> 08:28:39,890
Fill it with wood.

11639
08:28:39,990 --> 08:28:40,350
Wait...

11640
08:28:41,310 --> 08:28:42,310
A hole, what?

11641
08:28:44,210 --> 08:28:46,110
Burn the wood and put peanuts around the hole.

11642
08:28:46,290 --> 08:28:48,190
Then when the elephant goes to pick up a peanut...

11643
08:28:48,190 --> 08:28:49,530
You kick it in the...

11644
08:28:50,070 --> 08:28:51,350
In the ash hole.

11645
08:28:52,330 --> 08:28:53,170
Does this work?

11646
08:28:53,550 --> 08:28:54,570
What is this...

11647
08:28:55,030 --> 08:28:55,990
What is this joke?

11648
08:28:58,650 --> 08:28:59,890
Just hope you get enough rest.

11649
08:29:00,010 --> 08:29:00,730
Yeah, yeah.

11650
08:29:02,650 --> 08:29:03,330
I will.

11651
08:29:07,740 --> 08:29:11,240
Will the podcast MGS episode happen after the series is done for Bug Mom?

11652
08:29:11,460 --> 08:29:13,200
Well, I don't think she's gonna finish it in time.

11653
08:29:14,640 --> 08:29:15,060
She...

11654
08:29:15,640 --> 08:29:16,120
She's...

11655
08:29:16,120 --> 08:29:17,340
She hasn't even touched it.

11656
08:29:17,460 --> 08:29:17,900
So...

11657
08:29:17,900 --> 08:29:18,660
I don't...

11658
08:29:18,660 --> 08:29:19,640
I don't know.

11659
08:29:20,220 --> 08:29:20,780
But...

11660
08:29:20,780 --> 08:29:21,760
It'll still happen.

11661
08:29:24,940 --> 08:29:25,500
Yeah.

11662
08:29:26,960 --> 08:29:28,120
It'll still happen.

11663
08:29:28,200 --> 08:29:30,160
I think we're just gonna talk about...

11664
08:29:30,160 --> 08:29:30,960
Kind of...

11665
08:29:30,960 --> 08:29:32,220
I think I'm mostly gonna like...

11666
08:29:32,220 --> 08:29:35,240
Kind of remind her what she's been through so far.

11667
08:29:35,420 --> 08:29:37,000
And maybe her theories on...

11668
08:29:37,000 --> 08:29:38,380
About future games.

11669
08:29:39,160 --> 08:29:40,380
I'm gonna make...

11670
08:29:40,380 --> 08:29:41,220
I mean it'll be...

11671
08:29:41,220 --> 08:29:43,580
Spoilers for just MGS 1 and 2.

11672
08:29:43,580 --> 08:29:45,500
And then the beginning of 3.

11673
08:29:45,620 --> 08:29:46,560
Since that's all she's played.

11674
08:29:50,280 --> 08:29:50,760
So...

11675
08:29:50,760 --> 08:29:51,020
Yeah.

11676
08:29:51,080 --> 08:29:52,460
I'll have to censor myself...

11677
08:29:52,460 --> 08:29:53,340
A lot.

11678
08:29:53,900 --> 08:29:55,900
But we'll hear what her theories are.

11679
08:29:56,280 --> 08:29:56,640
And...

11680
08:29:56,640 --> 08:29:57,900
Things like that.

11681
08:29:59,680 --> 08:30:00,160
So...

11682
08:30:03,500 --> 08:30:05,220
Talk about the culture and the experience.

11683
08:30:05,600 --> 08:30:05,820
Yeah.

11684
08:30:05,880 --> 08:30:07,320
Talk about like...

11685
08:30:07,320 --> 08:30:08,060
You know.

11686
08:30:08,080 --> 08:30:09,380
What she's looking forward to.

11687
08:30:10,400 --> 08:30:10,880
And...

11688
08:30:10,880 --> 08:30:12,020
Things like that.

11689
08:30:12,300 --> 08:30:13,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11690
08:30:13,980 --> 08:30:14,700
Okie dokie.

11691
08:30:16,000 --> 08:30:16,680
Alrighty guys.

11692
08:30:16,800 --> 08:30:17,220
I'm gonna go.

11693
08:30:17,440 --> 08:30:18,160
Thank you guys.

11694
08:30:18,700 --> 08:30:20,380
Love to hear your MGS con review.

11695
08:30:20,600 --> 08:30:20,880
Yes!

11696
08:30:21,200 --> 08:30:21,660
Yes!

11697
08:30:21,860 --> 08:30:22,060
Yes!

11698
08:30:25,020 --> 08:30:25,940
Of course.

11699
08:30:27,540 --> 08:30:28,320
I'm gonna go.

11700
08:30:28,800 --> 08:30:29,560

For...

11703
08:30:31,540 --> 08:30:32,740
Cheering me on!

11704
08:30:32,900 --> 08:30:33,980
And pushing me...

11705
08:30:33,980 --> 08:30:35,360
To finish...

11706
08:30:36,040 --> 08:30:36,500
Through...

11707
08:30:36,500 --> 08:30:37,680
And everything.

11708
08:30:37,880 --> 08:30:39,020
I really appreciate it.

11709
08:30:39,720 --> 08:30:41,380
I'll see you guys tomorrow if I see you.

11710
08:30:41,440 --> 08:30:41,960

11711

I'll catch you when I catch you.

11712

Get some rest.

11717
08:30:49,320 --> 08:30:50,680
Thank you so much for watching.

11718
08:30:50,840 --> 08:30:52,380
