1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,500
It's the same as the day of the day You suddenly stood up
and said Tonight, I'm going to see you go I'm going to go

2
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,550
What are you going to do?

3
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:44,450
And everyone knows you and I laughed The ungodly way The
ungodly way The way Like a pucker like you're shabby Like a

4
00:00:44,450 --> 00:01:00,130
kid with a cold And I'm glad you I'm sure you're going to be
I'm going to be able to Not be I'm going to be From the

5
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:16,550
beginning of the night, The night sky is The stars are full
of the stars It's from the beginning To the world On the

6
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:42,580
moon, I'm the only one To get away Don't be afraid Come
here, come here, come here, come here, come here, Come here,

7
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,620
come here, come here, You are your hands, your

8
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:59,750
nuts I've yet to find the only female, But where is the
hippo-boss-sah-ma?

9
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,070
This is a little bit lonely.

10
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,890
It's a fun-giant one, one of you.

11
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:27,710
I can't say anything, I'm gonna say something, I'll tell you
about you.

12
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,290
I knew it was.

13
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,210
I knew it was always.

14
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,970
I don't know.

15
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,410
It's not.

16
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,470
Don't cry.

17
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,710
I just want to hear.

18
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:52,530
Oh.

19
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,270
I'm a strong girl.

20
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,510
I'm a big and I don't know.

21
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:11,450
I was like, but But the the that's all I love that's all,
that's all, that's all,

22
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:55,290
Go to the bottom, go to the heart.

23
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,590
The heart is loud.

24
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,150
The world is so sad.

25
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,930
The truth is sad.

26
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:20,770
I didn't want to say, I didn't want to say, I can't do it
again.

27
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,970
I'm not going to be able to go back on that summer day.

28
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:35,830
The shining stars are still there, but I can't remember it.

29
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,830
The smiling face, the angry face, the angry face.

30
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,250
I loved it.

31
00:04:44,630 --> 00:05:01,050
It's a bit weird, but I know it's not that you know that you
don't know it's my only my own secret to the night over the

32
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:15,410
night over my old memories you give me a Oh, you'll be able
to do it with an inaudient voice.
