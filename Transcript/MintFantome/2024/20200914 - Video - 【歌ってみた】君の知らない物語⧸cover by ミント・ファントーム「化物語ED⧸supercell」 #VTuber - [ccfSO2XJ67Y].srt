1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
A little pause... and we are back.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:04,780
A little pause... and we are back.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:31,930
A little pause... and we are back.

4
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:13,450
夜空は星が降るようで 夜空は星が降るようで いつからだろう 君のことを いつからだろう 君のことを

5
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,090
追いかける私がいた 届けない 驚かないで 届けない 驚かないで

6
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:35,250
聞いてよ 私の 聞いてよ 私の A little

7
00:01:44,030 --> 00:02:05,890
pause...

8
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,670
and we are back.

9
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:27,510
A little pause... and we are back.

10
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:10,670
A little pause...

11
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:10,670
and we are back.

12
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:18,550
This is what it's like to fall in love, isn't it?

13
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,790
Go

14
00:03:48,390 --> 00:04:45,290
to the bottom of your heart Listen to the voice of your heart The truth next to you is cruel I didn't say it, I couldn't say it I'll never say it again I can't forget that summer day The twinkling stars I can still remember them now Your smiling face and your angry face I loved them all It's strange,

15
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,470
isn't it?

16
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,130
I knew it, but...

17
00:04:49,130 --> 00:05:18,310
you didn't know I was your secret Beyond the night In our distant memory you take my finger In your innocent voice A little

18
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:37,510
pause...

19
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,650
and we are back.
