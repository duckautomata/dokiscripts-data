1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,440
Does this work?

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello?

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,340
Does this work?

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,900
Am I vertical?

5
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,650
Am I vertical?

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,150
Am I wide?

7
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,030
Am I wide?

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,170
I probably could be wide.

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,190
I really wanted to be.

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,010
Wide doko.

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,070
Hello everybody!

12
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,910
Okaerinasai masen!

13
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,630
Gojijin-sama, ojo-sama!

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,850
Welcome to Kyoyuki.

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not spam, buddy.

16
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,010
Wide.

17
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,970
How do I be wide?

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,350
Hold on.

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,930
No, I'm long!

20
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,730
Wrong way!

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,840
I don't think I like being long.

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,880
I don't know.

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,440
That's not wide.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,160
That was a big stretch.

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,020
Everybody, posture check.

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:44,980
Ready?

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,380
3, 2, 1!

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,240
Posture check!

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,340
Posture check!

30
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,240
Oh god, I can't stop getting long!

31
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,630
So long, so long.

32
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,970
Anyways, I'm here to sing.

33
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,690
Hold on.

34
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:15,330
I actually didn't really set up any of my stuff, so give me one second.

35
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,490
We'll put this here.

36
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:18,930
Oop.

37
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,630
And... yeah!

38
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:23,730
Okay, let's

39
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:35,890
get started.

40
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,930
Let's keep it up.

41
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:53,390
And... yeah!

42
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:53,510
Yaaay!

43
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:53,510
And...

44
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:53,510
here we go!

45
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:53,510
And... yeah!

46
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:53,510
I hope you guys are having a good evening.

47
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:53,690
Oh, thank you for the dono.

48
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,570
So, be sure to listen.

49
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:12,430
I don't truly plan on streaming on Mondays, but I don't know, usually when I'm in a sad mood, karaoke cheers me up.

50
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,730
And so, I thought I could just do a karaoke.

51
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,910
But this wasn't planned.

52
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,350
So true!

53
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,390
So yeah.

54
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:39,890
Karaoke makes me feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good.

56
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,230
And I thought maybe now would be a time to try shorts.

57
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:46,750
Shorting.

58
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,970
I'm short-circuiting.

59
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,610
I'm uh...

60
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,270
What do I say?

61
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,330
Wait, what's the word?

62
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,110
What am I saying?

63
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,730
Oh, um...

64
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,610
Short songs only?

65
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,650
That would be kind of difficult.

66
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,630
What is a short song only?

67
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,610
Actually, I have no idea.

68
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,430
You're already short enough?

69
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,630
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

70
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,470
I'm thinking maybe going like an hour.

71
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,690
Oh, TV size!

72
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,450
Oh my gosh, yeah!

73
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,990
I'll add in my TV size.

74
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,510
Dango?

75
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,130
You know what?

76
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,770
Let's do it.

77
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,770
I haven't sung that song in a long time.

78
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:40,610
Wait.

79
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,390
Oh no!

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,760
Okay, so I basically use this program called...

81
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,260
JoySound on the Switch.

82
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,600
I have to buy...

83
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,660
I have to buy the 24 hours.

84
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,520
Because it said that I had 100 free.

85
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,940
But I can only pick from a certain amount.

86
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,700
Can you do anime OPs?

87
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,160
I can!

88
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,740
I can sing whatever I want!

89
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,560
Isn't that so awesome?

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,840
Oh my gosh, I clicked on it and it already said 99.

91
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,980
Okay, hold on.

92
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,100
If I...

93
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,280
I have the money, so...

94
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,620
I just have to purchase it.

95
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,040
Actually, I'm only going to purchase an hour.

96
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,100
I don't know if that's worth the amount.

97
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,180
But you know what?

98
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,320
Dango...

99
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,880
Do they not have it?

100
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,060
Okay, then never mind.

101
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,080
We're going to find it on YouTube.

102
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,800
This is already working out really well for us, you guys.

103
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,630
Minty Mondays!

104
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,510
No...

105
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,730
Mintara Mondays!

106
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,110
Daikazoku!

107
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,170
Karaoke.

108
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,650
Let me make sure this one sounds good.

109
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,150
Let me make sure this one sounds good.

110
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,380
Okay, it sounds good.

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,960
Okay, first song.

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,720
Thank you.

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,840
JoySound finds...

114
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,280
Oh, no.

115
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,900
Let me...

116
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,300
I don't...

117
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,320
It's okay.

118
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,760
I told you.

119
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,580
I already have the funds.

120
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,700
Is this archived, boss?

121
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:35,920
Yeah.

122
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:36,780
Oh.

123
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,580
Probably.

124
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,280
Let me know if the audio is too low.

125
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,700
Yanjana yaki dango

126
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:47,800
Yasashi andango Sukoshi yume migachi na tsukimi dango Osumashi koma dango Yotsugo kushi dango Minna minna awosete Hyaku ni kazoku

127
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:16,720
赤ちゃんだんごも 幸せの中で 年寄りだんごは 目を細めてる 仲良しだんご 手をつなぎ 大きな丸いわになるよ

128
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:50,460
This is what I get for thinking I I remember the lyrics.

129
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,480
It's the opposite of YASASHI.

130
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,320
It's KANASHI.

131
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,040
How's the audio, by the way?

132
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,680
Is it okay?

133
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,300
Thank you.

134
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,700
It's like, it's over!

135
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,720
Yay!

136
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,080
Yay, yay, yay!

137
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,100
Dango daikatoku from Clannad.

138
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,880
Oh my gosh, thank you for the Akadono!

139
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,420
Thank you!

140
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Take my money.

141
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,060
Thank you for the lovely performance.

142
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,000
We love you.

143
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,300
Thank you so much, Deadly Nerd!

144
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,140
Thank you!

145
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:49,780
Oh my gosh.

146
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,060
It's way too much.

147
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,820
It's way too much.

148
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,920
Thank you!

149
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,080
Ushio.

150
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,540
Why did you do that to us?

151
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,400
What do you mean?

152
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,460
Clannad Tascaru.

153
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,840
Actually, there's another Clannad.

154
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:04,900
Actually, there's another Clannad.

155
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,260
Clannad sang that I really...

156
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,020
Oh.

157
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,500
Sorry.

158
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,660
Didn't mean for the double audio.

159
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,000
That I really love to sing.

160
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,200
Let me see if they have it.

161
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,200
It's the...

162
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,060
It's the opening from the second season.

163
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,900
Toki... Tokiyo... To... Ki...

164
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,660
Let me turn... Toky...

165
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,080
Tokiyo...

166
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,060
Kizamu...

167
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,380
Oh my gosh, my JoyCon key.

168
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,540
Let's see if they have it.

169
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:40,960
Oh!

170
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,980
I think that's it!

171
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,920
Is this it?

172
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,680
Wait.

173
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
No, no, the lyrics are wrong.

174
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,880
I can probably find it on YouTube though.

175
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,040
A karaoke of it.

176
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,020
Go away.

177
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,360
Maybe this is just YouTube karaoke today instead of Joy-san karaoke.

178
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,940
Luckily I haven't bought the subscription yet.

179
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,420
Tokioki...

180
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,600
Kizamu...

181
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,400
Uta...

182
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,540
Let me see if this sounds good.

183
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:27,730
Okay.

184
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,810
It sounds good enough.

185
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,050
It sounds like a karaoke so it doesn't sound like I won't get...

186
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,170
It sounds like a karaoke so it sounds like I won't get copyrighted.

187
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:39,750
Uh...

188
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,250
Key karaoke night.

189
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,930
Oh my gosh!

190
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,890
Key songs are kind of tricky.

191
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,570
Um, because...

192
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,610
For some reason...

193
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,490
Uh, for some reason...

194
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,810
They're not really on like...

195
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,270
JoySound and stuff.

196
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,550
Maybe in actual Japan, but for like these...

197
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,910
For like the home one, it's...

198
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,510
Um, a lot of them aren't.

199
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,670
Maybe we will do key karaoke.

200
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,290
Kind of fits the background.

201
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,470
It fits the vibe, right?

202
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,130
Alright, this is...

203
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,310
Tokioki zamu uta from...

204
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,050
Clannad.

205
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,670
Also...

206
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,270
Clannad.

207
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:27,160
Kimi dake ga sugisatta saka no tochuu wa Atatakana hidamari ga ikutsu mo dekite ta Boku hitori ga koko de yasashii Atatakasa wo omoikaeshiteru Kimi dake wo Oh, I loved you, only you.

208
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:44,460
The wind makes my eyes blur, and it makes me feel far away.

209
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:56,100
I will always remember, even if everything changes, just one thing, just one thing.

210
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:02,600
It's commonplace, but I'll show it to you, the one that is full of brilliance, just one thing.

211
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,680
I will always, always protect it.

212
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,520
Oh, so out of breath.

213
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,900
I've been singing this song for so long.

214
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,900
Even though it's already spring, and the cold days continue, I woke up earlier than the alarm clock.

215
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:39,800
You, who makes three servings of breakfast, are standing there.

216
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,960
Only you.

217
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,180
Only you.

218
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,260
Only you.

219
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:55,080
Only you are not by my side.

220
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Until yesterday, you were right by my side.

221
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,940
You were looking at me.

222
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,380
Bing bing!

223
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,760
Hongji, it's me!

224
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,460
It's me!

225
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,630
It's me!

226
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,290
Only you.

227
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,210
Only you.

228
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,810
I've been loving you.

229
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,790
Only you.

230
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,650
Only you.

231
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,390
I'm singing this song.

232
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,410
It's a song.

233
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,570
It's a song.

234
00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:00,850
Our, our time.

235
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,310
It's time weourcing, our time we've cut damaged.

236
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:17,110
Even if only one of the Te슴 just keeps on fresh, I won't go.

237
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,210
Ok,

238
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,190
I gotta prepare myself.

239
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,680
Yeah, yeah, Tokio Kizamu Uta.

240
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,020
From Clannad.

241
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,400
Yep, yep.

242
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,000
Yippee!

243
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,780
Thank you guys, thank you!

244
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,820
I'm really good, thank you!

245
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,840
Thank you for the party, party!

246
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,940
Thank you for the clapping!

247
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,260
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

248
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,420
Thank you for the donuts as well, you guys.

249
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,620
Thank you so much, thank you, thank you.

250
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,360
Loved it when you sang Odoriko from Bondi.

251
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,540
Maybe I will sing it again tonight, who knows.

252
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,660
Who knows, who knows.

253
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,800
Who knows, who knows, who knows.

254
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,620
Whatever.

255
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,720
I'll sing whatever I want.

256
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,180
Ningyo Hime from Chobits.

257
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,700
Oh my gosh.

258
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,540
I don't even remember how that goes.

259
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,360
I only remember the opening.

260
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,260
I think if I heard the ending, I would know it.

261
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,340
But if I...

262
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,640
Here, I'm gonna put on the BGM of...

263
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,880
Even if we're not using it.

264
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,120
JoySound BGM.

265
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,860
Live Shorts are a thing.

266
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,920
Yeah, isn't it crazy?

267
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,420
My Soul, Your Beats?

268
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,740
I wonder if they have that one on here.

269
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,100
Actually, you know what?

270
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,880
Let's just do YouTube.

271
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,000
Let's just YouTube it.

272
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,060
For some of these though, I'm gonna want to do it on JoySound just so I can change the key.

273
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,440
Depending on the song, you know?

274
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,320
My Soul, Your Beats.

275
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:30,920
Actually...

276
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,040
How does that song go again?

277
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,000
Do, do, do, do, do.

278
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,280
Do, do, do, do, do.

279
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,460
Do, do, do, do, do, do.

280
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,980
Are you just doing any song today?

281
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,680
No, I'm just singing whatever we want.

282
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,680
OJ Fruits Basket.

283
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,780
Oh my god, that's a good one too.

284
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,040
Okay, I can try and sing this one.

285
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,740
But I don't remember it entirely.

286
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,980
I think it'll come back to me if I hear it.

287
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,280
You know?

288
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,560
Maybe.

289
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,320
We'll see.

290
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,240
Okay.

291
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,560
Shut up JoySound.

292
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,240
This one should be good.

293
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,560
Let me test it.

294
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:22,940
Okay.

295
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,960
It sounds a little crunchy, but...

296
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,420
Kinda adds to the old school anime vibe.

297
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,920
This isn't even that old of an anime, but...

298
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,540
Woah, woah, woah.

299
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,880
The bass is going crazy.

300
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,460
Let's go.

301
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,720
Let's get it.

302
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,240
Ah, that's good.

303
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,480
Let's get that.

304
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,120
That's good.

305
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,220
That's a good one.

306
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,240
Next, let's go with the V.

307
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,260
We've got a complete collection of songs here.

308
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,420
The song is called Dying and it's about a girl who finds herself in a handshake.

309
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,600
Let's go with the girl who finds herself in a handshake.

310
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,980
Okay, I don't like this.

311
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,260
I don't like this instrumental at all.

312
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,780
Hold on.

313
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,740
I'm so sorry.

314
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,500
One more time.

315
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,560
Kind of wasn't so good.

316
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,580
You know what?

317
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,080
Let me check this one.

318
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,420
Oh, I'm afraid to use... I'm afraid to use official instrumentals.

319
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,160
I'm afraid that YouTube is going to be like, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no.

320
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,380
Oh, wait, let me see this one.

321
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,130
Okay, this one works much better.

322
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:01,610
Okay.

323
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,610
Sorry, guys.

324
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,850
Karaoke planet.

325
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,110
Ah, instrumental.

326
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,610
What is karaoke planet?

327
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:21,150
Is it like one of those YouTube channels that just has a bajillion

328
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,030
captions?

329
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,070
Kiss Kiss Falling Up.

330
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,130
My gosh, you know what I've been thinking of so much recently?

331
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,890
Is the is the ending for Ouran.

332
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,590
Oh my gosh, it's so good.

333
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,550
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

334
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:47,470
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

335
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,150
Ba-ba-ba-bam-bam-bam, ba-bam, bam, bam.

336
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,050
It's so good.

337
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,030
I think I.

338
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,430
No, no.

339
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,170
I don't know.

340
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,230
I think I prefer it over the opening.

341
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,850
There's just something about it that's so nostalgic-sounding about it.

342
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,810
It's so good.

343
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,290
Okay.

344
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,410
Yes, yes, shishou!

345
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,790
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

346
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,190
Okay.

347
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,770
Okay, let's try this again.

348
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,700
I keep turning it up, only to feel like I'm going to have to turn it down again.

349
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,700
眠い朝は 襟の帯を きつく締め

350
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:02,280
教室のドアくぐると ほんの少し 胸を張って 歩き出せる

351
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,320
そんな日常に 吹き抜ける風 家で寝て スタンプに 立って

352
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:35,500
A little pause... and we are back.

353
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,440
Was I supposed to start?

354
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:50,080
Was I supposed to start?

355
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,160
A

356
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,560
little pause... and we are back.

357
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:23,140
A little pause...

358
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,660
and we are back.

359
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:59,440
A little pause... and we are back.

360
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,800
Was I supposed to start?

361
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,740
This is certified karaoke.

362
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,420
That's how you know this is real.

363
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
This is the real deal.

364
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,320
That was funny.

365
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,960
That was silly.

366
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,240
That was my soul, your beats?

367
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,120
Here, here, here.

368
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,320
What's up?

369
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:09,700
You're singing it perfectly.

370
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,900
Thank you.

371
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,040
You're too kind.

372
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,320
You're too kind.

373
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,980
Oh my gosh, thank you for the 50.

374
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,740
Thank you so much.

375
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,160
Thank you for your lovely singing.

376
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,860
Thank you.

377
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,940
Thank you so much.

378
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,580
Thank you, thank you.

379
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,600
Oh, man.

380
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,780
Your singing is so beautiful.

381
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,360
Thank you.

382
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,340
We're too quiet.

383
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,340
Quine.

384
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,960
Oh, Final Fantasy.

385
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,680
Oh my gosh.

386
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,700
Oh my gosh, I wanted to sing Eyes on Me last time.

387
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,360
Oh my gosh, I wanted to sing Eyes on Me last time.

388
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,180
So I'm going to sing it.

389
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,040
So I'm going to sing it.

390
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,760
I'm so excited.

391
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,420
I love this song so much.

392
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,840
I have a question.

393
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,120
I have a question.

394
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,900
Are you a Pikmi?

395
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,840
Am I a Pikmi?

396
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,620
What counts as a Pikmi?

397
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:03,760
What counts as a Pikmi?

398
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,320
No, I think I'm a...

399
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,140
I would hope that I'm a girl's girl.

400
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
I think I'm a...

401
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,220
I would like to think that I'm a girl's girl.

402
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm like, yeah, you go, girl.

403
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,380
You go, girl.

404
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,680
That's what I think.

405
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,300
Also, welcome, new viewers.

406
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,620
I know that, like, with...

407
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,700
With being short, some...

408
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,360
I was going to say strange.

409
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,500
No, you're not strange.

410
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,600
Sorry, we get a new audience.

411
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,640
So it's a little different than usual, but I think it's kind of fun to...

412
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:49,120
I think it's fun to kind of get new people finding me as well, right?

413
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,840
I'm Mint.

414
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,060
I'm a Vtuber.

415
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,100
I'm a ghost.

416
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,200
Yeah.

417
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,940
I sing sometimes.

418
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh my gosh.

419
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,360
Wait.

420
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,800
Spice and Wolf started... I think it has started airing, hasn't it?

421
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,040
I haven't watched it yet.

422
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,780
But I want to.

423
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,160
Because obviously Spice and Wolf...

424
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,460
It has?

425
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,180
Oh, today!

426
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,080
Oh my gosh.

427
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,120
Wow, wow.

428
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,760
Oh, wait, wait.

429
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,920
Two episodes are out already?

430
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,520
Oh my goodness.

431
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,980
Holo is a Vtuber.

432
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,720
I saw that.

433
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,340
Oh my gosh.

434
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,600
Holo live.

435
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,840
It's crazy.

436
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,360
Will this be archived?

437
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,680
I intend on it being archived, yes.

438
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,820
But it's all up to YouTube.

439
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,080
Hi, Mint.

440
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,240
Nice to meet ya.

441
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,200
Hi, Adam.

442
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,700
Nice to meet you too.

443
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,040
Thank you guys for all the donations.

444
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,980
I am reading them.

445
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,020
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

446
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,700
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

447
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:54,780
Okay.

448
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,660
Eyes on me from...

449
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,720
Let me check if this one's okay.

450
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,540
But this is from Final Fantasy.

451
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,590
Okay.

452
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,170
It sounds good.

453
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:11,890
Okay, hold on.

454
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,550
Where does it start?

455
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,390
Okay, here we go.

456
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,450
I might have to turn it down though.

457
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:16,970
Let's see.

458
00:32:47,040 --> 00:33:36,520
Whenever I sang my songs on the stage on my own I never said my words Wishing they would be heard I saw you smiling at me Was it real or just my fantasy You'd always be there in the corner of this This tiny little bar My last night here for you Same old songs,

459
00:33:36,780 --> 00:34:07,680
just once more My last night here with you Maybe yes, maybe no I kind of liked it your way How you shyly placed your eyes on me Oh, did you ever know That I had mine

460
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:55,640
Darling, so there you are With that look on your face As if you're never hurt As if you're never down Shall I be the one for you Who pinches you softly But sure If frown is shown then I will know that You are no dreamer

461
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:54,900
So let me come to you Close as I want to be Close enough for me To feel your heart beating fast And stay there as I whisper, how I loved your peaceful eyes on me.

462
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:05,020
But did you ever know that I had mine on you?

463
00:36:08,220 --> 00:37:09,910
Darling, so share with me Your love if you have enough Your tears if you're holding back Or pain if that's what it is How can I let you know More than the dress and the voice Just reach me out then you will know that you are not dreaming Darling so there you are With that look on your face As if you're never hurt As if you're never hurt As if you're never hurt

464
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,100
I saw someone in the chat say, Go, dead girl, go.

465
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,820
Something from Full Moon.

466
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,760
Oh my gosh.

467
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,000
It's one of my first ever videos I uploaded on YouTube.

468
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,040
It's gone forever now.

469
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,780
It's gone...

470
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,200
It's long, long gone forever.

471
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,040
But...

472
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:03,900
But...

473
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,720
But...

474
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,380
I once sang a cover of...

475
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,700
From this...

476
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,440
From this...

477
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,640
Oh, wait.

478
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,700
I think I just clicked it.

479
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,200
No, I don't want that one.

480
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,120
How does this one go again?

481
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
The early days...

482
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,440
It actually was the early days of YouTube.

483
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,280
I'll have to see how this one goes.

484
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,880
I don't remember.

485
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,680
Oh my god, my ears.

486
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,100
My ears.

487
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,730
It's been so long...

488
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,510
It's been so long since I've sang any of these before.

489
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,130
I can't...

490
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,510
I remember Eternal Snow maybe the best.

491
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,590
What's Myself?

492
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,350
I can't remember.

493
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,250
Oh, I know this one.

494
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,630
I remember, I remember, I remember.

495
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,850
Okay, okay, okay.

496
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,510
I'll do this one.

497
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,350
Myself from...

498
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:15,910
Full Moon.

499
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:34,580
of Sagashite Tell me I really care How much I feel I'm overflowing with tears Okay it's gonna take me a second to get back into it...

500
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,740
What I've

501
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,620
lost is too much to forget Nothing I'll ever mostly forget

502
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,620
A little pause...

503
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:33,620
and we are back.

504
00:40:45,760 --> 00:41:03,620
A little pause... and we are back.

505
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,110
I don't think I'll remember the rest though.

506
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,920
Here, we'll do a short version of that one.

507
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,100
We'll just fade, fade, and fade out.

508
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,340
I can do Eternal Snow though.

509
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,340
I know this one better.

510
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,920
Let's test the audio.

511
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,540
Holy bass!

512
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,010
Holy bass!

513
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,030
Holy bass!

514
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:32,310
Thank you for watching this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.

515
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,870
Thank you for watching this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.

516
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:18,070
Thank you for watching this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.

517
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:48,070
Thank you for watching this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.

518
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:20,490
Thank you for watching this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.

519
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:46,930
Thank you for watching this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.

520
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,490
Thank you for watching this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.

521
00:45:51,370 --> 00:46:13,590
Thank you for watching this video, I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.

522
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:13,870
That

523
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,620
was too early.

524
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,360
I love you.

525
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,020
I wish I could show you what the background I've been looking at on this video has been the whole time.

526
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,620
It's been like these horses...

527
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,060
It's been like horses and...

528
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,320
And like some of them look really goofy because they're cartoon...

529
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,460
Or not cartoon.

530
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,620
They're like statues of cartoon horses.

531
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,380
I don't understand why.

532
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,900
It was distracting me so much.

533
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,740
Snake Eater cover, when?

534
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,560
Oh my gosh.

535
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,860
Do you want me to sing Snake Eater?

536
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,740
Is that what you're saying?

537
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,340
I can't.

538
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:08,760
I'm not allowed.

539
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,240
No, I'm just kidding.

540
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,240
Okay, we can do Snake Eater.

541
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,280
Let's sing it, baby.

542
00:47:35,850 --> 00:48:34,330
What a thrill With darkness and silence through the night What a thrill I'm searching and I'll melt into you What a fear in my heart But you're so supreme I give my life, not for honor, but for you, snake eater, in my time, there'll be no one else, it's the way I fly.

543
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:59,630
I'm still in a dream, snake eater, and some day you go through the rain, and some day you feed on a tree frog.

544
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:08,950
This ordeal, the trial to survive, for the day we see.

545
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:20,550
I give my life, not for honor, but for you, snake

546
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:30,610
eater, in my time, there'll be no one else,

547
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,060
it's the way I

548
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:45,610
fly.

549
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:53,890
I'm still in a dream, snake eater, in my time, there'll be no one else, it's the way I fly.

550
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,070
I'm

551
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:13,480
still in a dream, snake eater, snake eater.

552
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,370
I'm still in a dream,

553
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:41,930
snake eater, snake eater.

554
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:49,510
Like always , in my dream.

555
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:53,230
Tou.

556
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:00,250
To.

557
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:00,670
To.

558
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:00,810
To.

559
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:00,830
To.

560
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:11,430
I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad.

561
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,410
Thank you guys for all the donos, I really appreciate it.

562
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:16,530
Pretty good.

563
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,930
Secret base from Anohana.

564
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,650
Calling to the night.

565
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:24,190
I could try.

566
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,270
Sins of the father.

567
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:27,970
Oh my god, that song is so hard.

568
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:29,750
It's just so difficult.

569
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:30,810
I don't know what to say.

570
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:32,930
I've never tried singing it so much.

571
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:33,590
But...

572
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,210
When I say that, I mean like I tried singing it in my room.

573
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:38,850
But I had to...

574
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:42,970
I was being quiet because I didn't know if my neighbors would be able to hear me.

575
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:44,190
In Japan.

576
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,010
Let's see if the calling to the night...

577
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:49,150
I didn't intend on this just being Metal Gear.

578
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:49,950
But we can try.

579
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,570
A couple of Metal Gear songs.

580
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:55,190
Let's do this one.

581
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:56,670
Let me see if this one is good.

582
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,630
Let me try this one.

583
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:09,330
Oh, no, no, no.

584
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,050
Oh, instrumental.

585
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:11,650
Here we go.

586
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:13,410
Let me check it.

587
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:14,570
Okay.

588
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,650
Hopefully it's good.

589
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:18,690
Wait, let me get the lyrics.

590
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,590
Calling to the night.

591
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:26,410
Wait, lyrics.

592
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:27,430
I forgot to write.

593
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:30,390
This is from Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.

594
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:32,650
Yes.

595
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:37,380
Let's see.

596
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,450
I might have to adjust the volume a little bit.

597
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,130
But that's okay.

598
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:52,170
What's that sound?

599
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,030
What's that sound like?

600
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:58,830
Through the night.

601
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,210
To the day.

602
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,490
When everything is gone.

603
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:07,870
Carry the soul.

604
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:08,350
Through the night.

605
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:14,950
All away from the dry lands.

606
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,670
In the sun we see.

607
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:24,430
Fighting over lines.

608
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:29,190
All our dreams and wishes.

609
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:34,230
We send hope for safe keeping.

610
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,890
Fighting for what's right.

611
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:38,350
We send hope for safe keeping.

612
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,680
We send hope for safe keeping.

613
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,160
I know there's one part I always get the timing off on.

614
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,320
So apologies in advance if I don't remember.

615
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,520
Calling to the night.

616
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,680
To dream.

617
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,260
Again in the light.

618
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,780
Waiting for a storm to rise.

619
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,620
Waiting for a storm to rise.

620
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,600
A little pause... and we are back.

621
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,350
A little pause... and we are back.

622
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:35,810
Hear the ringing echoes in the splitting horizon.

623
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,790
Calling to the night.

624
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,210
That one is so hard.

625
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:51,970
Difficult.

626
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:54,470
That was Calling to the Night from Metal Gear Solid.

627
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:56,130
Portable Apps.

628
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,830
It's a really tough song though.

629
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,270
It's hard for me to sing it even.

630
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:02,450
Let's see.

631
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:05,450
I hope people said Sins of the Father but...

632
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:17,070
I'm gonna sound not as good as Donna Burke.

633
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:18,250
At all.

634
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,390
Simple and Clean?

635
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:21,590
Okay we can do that one next.

636
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:22,750
We'll do that one.

637
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:25,730
Wait.

638
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:28,170
You mean Simple and Clean English.

639
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:31,130
Not... what is the Japanese one?

640
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:31,510
Hikari?

641
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:33,710
Right, right?

642
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:40,580
Wait.

643
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,640
Japanese... yeah which one are you...

644
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,300
Both!

645
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,680
Wait I see a lot of people saying Hikari.

646
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:47,520
Wait.

647
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:47,920
No.

648
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,260
I mean which one should I sing?

649
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,880
Simple and Clean or Hikari?

650
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:54,980
Either one is good.

651
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:55,660
Either.

652
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,720
Spanish version.

653
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:57,400
Oh.

654
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:58,440
Oh.

655
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,480
Oh.

656
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:00,560
Oh.

657
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,900
I'm gonna run it through Google Translate and just...

658
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:05,380
Okay.

659
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,500
Simple and Clean preferred.

660
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,040
Okay.

661
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,960
I will do Simple AND Clean.

662
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,340
But before that I will do Sins of the Father.

663
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,200
Oh gosh.

664
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,520
I'm really nervous about...

665
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:15,780
Don't.

666
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,120
Okay.

667
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,340
If you were thinking of clipping this, please don't.

668
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,360
Because I don't know if it'll be any good.

669
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,440
Okay.

670
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:21,760
Okay.

671
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:22,820
Okay.

672
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,400
Oh gosh.

673
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,720
I think it starts right away.

674
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,180
Wait.

675
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:32,580
Hold on.

676
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,040
When does it start?

677
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:59,600
In the deepest nights Reaching out, grasping for a fleeting memory All these thoughts keep piercing this broken mind I fall but I'm still standing Emotionless Emotionless

678
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:30,940
Far in the distance There is light A light that burns these scars of old All this pain reminds me of what I am I'll live I'll become alive I need to be here.

679
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,100
Words

680
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:15,290
that kill.

681
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:19,930
Would you speak them to me?

682
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,750
With your breath so still.

683
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,810
It makes me believe.

684
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,410
In the father's sins.

685
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:36,970
Let me suffer now.

686
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:39,250
And never die.

687
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:42,650
I'm alive.

688
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,120
Oh this song is so hard.

689
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:50,980
Oh my god.

690
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,970
But I would listen to it all the time in Japan.

691
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:01,270
Like walking to him from home.

692
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:02,250
Oh my god.

693
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:03,510
It was like my power anthem.

694
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:11,470
But I never got to practice it at karaoke so...

695
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:13,990
Pride.

696
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:18,370
Feeds their blackened hearts.

697
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:24,890
And the thirst must be quenched to fuel hypocrisy.

698
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:31,790
Cleansing flames is the only way to repay.

699
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:32,750
Repent.

700
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:34,890
Renounce.

701
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:38,270
What made you words that kill.

702
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,770
Would you speak them to me?

703
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:46,470
With your breath so still.

704
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,710
It makes me believe.

705
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:50,990
Oh god, oh god.

706
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:53,170
The sins.

707
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:56,310
Never die.

708
01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:00,490
Can't wash this blood off our hands.

709
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,810
Let the world fear us all.

710
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:07,110
It's just means to an end.

711
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:10,050
Our salvation lies.

712
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:16,870
In love are the sins.

713
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:20,230
Let me suffer now.

714
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:33,100
In my heart are the light of the dark.

715
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:39,000
In his eyes...

716
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,300
Whoa...

717
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,190
Whoa...

718
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:52,250
Whoa...

719
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,260
Gluh replete rapid-re beaches.

720
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:29,880
Oh gosh I've never sung that at all.

721
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:30,880
Glow Midwest hard too fast.

722
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:43,660
Like I said, whenever I would practice in my room, it would be like, I would be like as quiet, like without, like trying to sing it but very quietly because I'm like, what if my neighbors can hear me?

723
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:48,780
What if like I'm outside, like someone's outside and you just hear me go, whoa, whoa, how?

724
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:53,850
Oh, you should keep practicing loud.

725
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:54,530
I'll try.

726
01:02:55,170 --> 01:03:01,290
Now that I'm back home, I can, at my maid cafe, I can keep practicing louder, louder.

727
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:04,110
Sorry, sorry to all my neighbors.

728
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:07,470
I only care what my neighbors in Japan think, I guess.

729
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:13,650
Also, oh my gosh, S-L-I-D, bunch of numbers.

730
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:14,670
Thank you for the akadono.

731
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:15,930
Thank you for the song.

732
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:16,790
Thank you.

733
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:18,290
Thank you guys for all the donos.

734
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,430
Thank you so much.

735
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:21,050
Love the streams, especially the karaoke.

736
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:23,070
You rejuvenated my passion for drawing.

737
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:23,950
Oh my gosh.

738
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,450
Yippee, thank you.

739
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:30,950
Or rather, yes, thank you for the dono.

740
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:33,990
I'm so happy about you coming back to drawing.

741
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:35,750
Sorry, not sorry, neighbors.

742
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:36,410
Exactly.

743
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:37,470
Exactly.

744
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,730
My God has returned.

745
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:48,410
My, my, my God.

746
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,210
Thank you guys for the dono.

747
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:56,410
Who was thinking it actually, it sounded great.

748
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:57,550
Would, whoa ho again.

749
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:05,670
It's those, well, hose are really hard to, to, and like, I love how Donna Burke her voice like it's so raspy.

750
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:09,070
So I like try to kind of do that, but I'm not good at it.

751
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:14,110
But like, she has like such a powerful voice.

752
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:18,330
So I feel like mine completely pales in comparison, but that's okay.

753
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:19,430
It's all for fun, right?

754
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:21,030
I'm not a professional here.

755
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:29,110
This one is good for simple and clean.

756
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,440
No, no.

757
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:36,060
I need no words.

758
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,160
No Utada Hikaru backup.

759
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:43,340
Actually, I might have to do... let me do Hikari.

760
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,680
Let me type in Hikari, but I'll sing simple and clean.

761
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,460
Oh, this is perfect!

762
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,280
Wait, let me see.

763
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,440
I don't like the way it sounds, so hold on.

764
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:06,740
Oh no, you can hear the Hikari vocals, you know what I mean?

765
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,220
Oh wait, this is Gainashi.

766
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:10,140
Okay, good, good, good.

767
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,100
Because it's the same intro, right?

768
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,100
Let me check.

769
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,200
Let's listen to this one.

770
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:42,100
Please, oh baby, don't go Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel Tonight, it's hard to let it go

771
01:05:45,660 --> 01:06:13,520
You're giving me too many things lately You're all I need You smiled at me and said Don't get me wrong, I love you But does that mean I have to meet your father?

772
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:52,770
When we are older, you're not nice And no, I don't think life is quite that simple When you walk away, you don't hear me say Please, oh baby, don't go Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel Tonight, it's hard to let it go So simple and clean,

773
01:06:53,090 --> 01:07:22,870
oh The daily things like this and that What is what that keeps us all busy Are confusing me That's when you came to me and said Wish I could prove I love you But does that mean I have to walk on water?

774
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:59,830
When we are older, you'll understand It's enough when I say so And maybe some things are that simple When you walk away, you don't hear me say Please, oh baby, don't go Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel Tonight, it's hard to let it go Hold me,

775
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:03,290
whatever lies Oh my god, my throat!

776
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:42,530
Each morning is a little later on Regardless of warnings The future doesn't scare me at all Nothing's like before When you walk away You don't hear me say Please, oh baby, don't go Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel Tonight, it's hard to let it go Hold me,

777
01:08:42,810 --> 01:09:32,630
whatever lies beyond this warning Is a little later on Regardless of warnings The future doesn't scare me at all Nothing's like before Hold me, whatever lies beyond this warning Is a little later on Regardless of warnings The future doesn't scare me at all Nothing's like before Nothing's like before Another day disturbing you Anything else you do Everything here...

778
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:14,500
Nothing's like you Nothing's like the warm Nothing's like me The rest was simple and clean.

779
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,000
Simple and clean.

780
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,100
Could have fooled me.

781
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,520
What do you mean can't hit high notes?

782
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,400
I said I can't hit them as well.

783
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,660
Oh my gosh, good playlist.

784
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,140
Thank you for the 70.

785
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:29,640
Oh my gosh.

786
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,140
Your voice is so powerful.

787
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,480
Thanks for spoiling us with your voice.

788
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,560
Your voice is peaceful, soothing, and beautiful.

789
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:36,380
Thank you!

790
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,240
Thank you so, so much.

791
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,340
Thank you guys for all the donuts.

792
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,100
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

793
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,000
What could be next?

794
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,820
I can go for probably like another...

795
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,580
20 minutes or so.

796
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:50,780
So we can do a couple more...

797
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:51,880
songs.

798
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,720
Ikenai Borderline.

799
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,140
Okay, okay, okay.

800
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,020
Ikenai...

801
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:04,780
Space Odyssey.

802
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,200
Oh my gosh, you know that's not Space Odyssey.

803
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,960
I've been singing...

804
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:13,480
Actually...

805
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,520
Sorry, I'm going to sing something...

806
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,360
too.

807
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,880
That I want to sing also.

808
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,480
Thank you!

809
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,960
Thank you for treating to me...

810
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,040
that taste of my childhood.

811
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:26,320
It's mine too!

812
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:27,520
It's mine too.

813
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,480
Oh my gosh, that makes me want to bring up something.

814
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,340
Okay, sorry.

815
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,820
I have a super un-based taste.

816
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,580
Or un-based opinion.

817
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,320
Okay, so the other day...

818
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40,080
I did karaoke.

819
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,200
And someone requested one of the Free Run songs.

820
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,640
And I didn't recognize it.

821
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:46,340
And someone in the comments was like...

822
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,360
She said she loves Free Run.

823
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,500
But she didn't even know...

824
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,480
the name of the song.

825
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,260
I'm sorry.

826
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,800
I don't like...

827
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,600
Well, okay, the OP is not as bad.

828
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:03,240
The ED, I really love the chorus...

829
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:03,840
of the ED.

830
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,060
But I cannot...

831
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,200
Oh my god, the song starts and I...

832
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:12,980
I'm sorry.

833
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:14,500
I'm sorry.

834
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:16,100
Oh no, one of those types of...

835
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:16,500
No, no, no!

836
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:17,420
I am not.

837
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:20,440
I am typically not one of those types of people.

838
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,000
I am almost always...

839
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,980
a true believer in listening...

840
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,920
to the opening and the ending every time.

841
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,060
But...

842
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,080
Not the best...

843
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:31,840
Millet?

844
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:32,860
Millet?

845
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:34,060
Is that how you pronounce it?

846
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:34,320
Song?

847
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,720
Like, when she starts and she goes...

848
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,400
It's alright.

849
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,140
And then in the background it goes...

850
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:40,080
Yeah, I'm alright.

851
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:41,720
I'm okay.

852
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:42,780
Yeah, I'm okay.

853
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,380
I can't.

854
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:45,220
I can't.

855
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:49,900
I can't.

856
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:50,560
I just...

857
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,860
There's something about it that literally...

858
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,440
grates my spine.

859
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:00,060
The chorus, though, is so beautiful.

860
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,100
And I love it so much.

861
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,420
But just the beginning of the song makes me be like...

862
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,120
Okay, next episode.

863
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,120
I'm sorry.

864
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,540
Well, when you put it like that...

865
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:12,460
Honestly fair.

866
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:13,180
I'm sorry.

867
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,700
I'm sorry that it is an un-based opinion.

868
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,100
But, you know, I'm so based all the time...

869
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,700
I have to have some un-based opinions.

870
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,140
Right?

871
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,520
I can't be perfect, you guys.

872
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:22,980
Jeez.

873
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,020
But this song...

874
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:29,340
This song is perfect.

875
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:29,720
Perfect.

876
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:40,980
Superb Xing Superb Sings Superb Xing Superb Sings She got the terribly longม She's having a whoa when she put the ?

877
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,160
Mommy's dead.

878
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:44,800
With Mom

879
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:05,600
A little

880
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:23,770
pause...

881
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:24,330
and we are back.

882
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:54,410
A little pause... and we are back.

883
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:26,890
One of my favorite things about this song is when they play it at, like, any Kura, like, any anime song events.

884
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:27,990
Um...

885
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:32,670
When the chorus comes, people will break UO's, which are really bright glow sticks, and just...

886
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:34,010
It's called...

887
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:35,310
It's called cycloning.

888
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:35,670
They just...

889
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:37,530
They just swirl them around a lot.

890
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:38,190
It's so fun!

891
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:05,150
Look, the eyes work with it, because of the song...matter.

892
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:08,290
Sneaky.

893
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:13,270
Not the giddy-giddy eyes.

894
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:16,370
Sure.

895
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:17,470
I'm serious!

896
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:18,470
I'm serious.

897
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:20,110
I'm dead serious.

898
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,730
I'm always dead serious.

899
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:25,270
I'm dead serious!

900
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:28,790
I'm dead serious!

901
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:29,530
I'm dead serious!

902
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:29,690
Um...

903
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:32,510
Let's see, what else?

904
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:32,870
What else?

905
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:35,610
Thank you for the dono.

906
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:36,170
Thank you!

907
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:38,970
It'd be interesting to sing...

908
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:41,210
Hear you sing Ace Combat songs one day.

909
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:42,090
Maybe one day.

910
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:50,030
My partner heard Yukaha-san run into Ikina borderline from the other room, and he said, I'm glad she's back on her bullshit.

911
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:53,350
I'm glad she's back on her bullshit.

912
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:54,410
What do you mean by that?

913
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,950
What do you mean by that?

914
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:59,530
Also, Shrimp, thank you for the sex change.

915
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:01,730
Thank you for the fantastic voice.

916
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:03,430
You really helped me stay awake during work.

917
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:04,690
Oh, good luck with work!

918
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:10,060
I'm gonna try singing this song.

919
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,680
It's not a Japanese...

920
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,840
It's not an anime song, I'm sorry.

921
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,000
But maybe...

922
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,800
We can do whatever we want.

923
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,720
We don't have to do just anime songs.

924
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:30,400
I saw someone asking for Phantom of the Opera, but I honestly don't think my voice can handle it today.

925
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:31,860
But I honestly don't think my voice can handle it today.

926
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,700
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see.

927
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,400
Maybe I can.

928
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:33,980
Who knows.

929
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,680
This song, I'm gonna try and do it.

930
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,040
Usually I sing it...

931
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,600
Actually, maybe I shouldn't sing it.

932
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,240
I don't know.

933
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,600
Maybe I shouldn't sing this.

934
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,080
Maybe my voice isn't good for this either.

935
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,580
I don't know.

936
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:53,220
I don't know.

937
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,080
You know what?

938
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:56,340
Whatever.

939
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,540
I can sing whatever I want.

940
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:58,460
Do it, Min.

941
01:19:58,540 --> 01:19:58,900
Ganba.

942
01:19:59,040 --> 01:19:59,360
Okay.

943
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,220
Take a break and sing Tequila.

944
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:03,820
No, we only have...

945
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:06,380
I only plan on singing not very much longer anyway.

946
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:07,980
Just have fun.

947
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:09,480
Yeah, we're just having fun with it.

948
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,900
You can sing whatever you want.

949
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:12,920
But...

950
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,300
Yeah, I'll try it.

951
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,420
If it doesn't sound good, I'm really sorry.

952
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:19,800
But I love this song.

953
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:23,640
This is another song that I would listen to repeat all the time when I was in Japan.

954
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,600
I'm basically singing a couple of my comfort songs.

955
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,100
Well, Sins of the Father was a comfort song.

956
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:29,860
This is a comfort song.

957
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:32,140
What else did I listen to?

958
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:32,540
Sing!

959
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:35,220
The Carpenter song was a comfort song.

960
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,360
So...

961
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:37,600
Okay.

962
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,840
I'm going to try and sing this one.

963
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:50,690
This is Mariana Cross by Ghost.

964
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:56,110
But I can't tell if the key will be okay for me.

965
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:57,350
We'll see!

966
01:20:59,510 --> 01:21:03,750
We were speeding together Down the dark avenues

967
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:18,710
But besides all the stardom All we got was blues But through all the sorrow We were riding high

968
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:28,070
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go Let you go I never let you go.

969
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:34,250
We were scanning the cities, walking to greater do's.

970
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:41,550
But besides all the glamour, all we got was bruised.

971
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:48,530
But through all the sorrow, we were riding high.

972
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:55,830
And the truth of the matter is, I never let you go.

973
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:57,630
Let you go.

974
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:09,810
You go down just like Holy Mary, Mariana, Mariana Cross.

975
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:17,230
Not just another Bloody Mary, Mariana, Mariana Cross.

976
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:24,590
If you choose to run away with me, I will tickle you internally.

977
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:30,810
And I see nothing wrong with that.

978
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,440
Marineris Ars.

979
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:51,320
We were searching for reasons to play by the rules.

980
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,720
But we quickly found out it was just for fools.

981
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:06,220
But through all the sorrow, we'll be riding high.

982
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:13,400
And the truth of the matter is, I'll never let you go.

983
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,200
Let you go.

984
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:19,480
Never gonna let you go, chat!

985
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:28,700
You go down just like Holy Mary, Mariana, Mariana Cross.

986
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,760
Mariana, Mariana Cross.

987
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:38,640
Not just another Bloody Mary, Mariana, Mariana.

988
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:46,680
You go down just like Holy Mary, Mariana, Mariana Cross.

989
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:54,060
Your beauty never ever scared me, Mariana, Mariana Cross.

990
01:23:54,060 --> 01:24:01,680
If you choose to run away with me, I will tickle you internally.

991
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:07,580
And I see nothing wrong with that.

992
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:20,290
Nothing wrong with that.

993
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:26,160
I can't tell.

994
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,140
I know it's not.

995
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,260
I know it's not.

996
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:31,460
Just a laugh.

997
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:48,310
I am not going to let you go, chat.

998
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:49,930
And I'll be the one to say this, You go down just like Holy Mary, And I will tickle you internally.

999
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:52,390
I'm not going to let you go, chat.

1000
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:55,890
Mariana Cross.

1001
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:56,970
Let me take the baby down.

1002
01:24:56,970 --> 01:25:01,790
And I'm the one to say this, You go down just like Holy Mary, Mariana Cross.

1003
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:04,490
Okay, let me do it.

1004
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:05,030
I can't do that.

1005
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:06,910
I don't know if I could do it.

1006
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:07,490
Okay.

1007
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:08,030
You know what?

1008
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:09,150
Phantom of the Opera.

1009
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:12,030
Let's just see if my... Let's see.

1010
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:12,770
Let's see.

1011
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:19,950
What is... What is a Phantom of the Opera song?

1012
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:21,530
Just the original.

1013
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:25,730
Phantom of the Opera is here inside my mind.

1014
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:27,090
That one?

1015
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:31,430
Or another... Or any... Just a Phantom of the Opera song.

1016
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:35,750
Short-ish.

1017
01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:37,490
Not really.

1018
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:40,890
Think of me?

1019
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:41,870
Okay.

1020
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,700
All I ask of you?

1021
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:48,580
The one you like the most?

1022
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:50,720
The point of no return?

1023
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,620
That song is dirty!

1024
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,920
Let me see if this one's good.

1025
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:01,880
Oh, wait.

1026
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:02,140
Hold on.

1027
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:03,100
Let me see if the man speaks.

1028
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:06,640
No, I don't want it to be a solo.

1029
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:12,200
All I ask of you.

1030
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:13,180
Karaoke.

1031
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:14,700
Female part only.

1032
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,700
Gosh, I love Youtube.

1033
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:20,500
You sing Raul?

1034
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:21,440
No, no, no, no.

1035
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,680
Christine part...

1036
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:27,300
Christine part only instrumental.

1037
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:29,540
Christine... No, no, no.

1038
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:32,180
Raul part... Oh, wait!

1039
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:33,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

1040
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,620
I should put in male part only.

1041
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:37,540
I put in the wrong thing.

1042
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:46,540
Okay, I don't know who this Clark on stage guy is, but I'm using your work.

1043
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,500
Thank you very much.

1044
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:50,280
It says sing along with me, so...

1045
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:52,780
Hopefully he sounds good.

1046
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:53,880
I believe in him.

1047
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:54,900
He's got a lot of subscribers.

1048
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,620
I'm still standing.

1049
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,260
I'm still standing.

1050
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:07,440
Yeah, yeah.

1051
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,420
Oh, sorry.

1052
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:08,960
Sorry.

1053
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:09,400
Go ahead, Clark.

1054
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:11,200
Oh, no.

1055
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:11,820
This is the intro.

1056
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:19,900
Go on, Clark.

1057
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,220
Do your thing.

1058
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:23,860
Eventually.

1059
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:25,700
Okay, okay.

1060
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:26,100
He's starting.

1061
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:26,860
He's good.

1062
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:27,980
He's gonna do it.

1063
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:33,360
Oh my god.

1064
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,040
He's beautiful.

1065
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,580
Oh my god.

1066
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:44,440
My words will warm and calm you.

1067
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,880
Oh, sorry.

1068
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,880
I thought this was my part.

1069
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,940
Let daylight dry your tears.

1070
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:56,220
I'm here with you, beside you.

1071
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:00,380
To guard you and to guide you.

1072
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:08,320
Say you'll love me every waking moment.

1073
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:15,820
Turn my head with talk of summer time.

1074
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:24,800
Say you need me with you now and always.

1075
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:30,680
Promise me that all you say is true.

1076
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:37,220
That's all I ask of you.

1077
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:39,220
Let me be your shelter.

1078
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:43,700
Let me be your light.

1079
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:45,020
You're safe.

1080
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:47,180
No one will find you.

1081
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,000
Your fears are far behind you.

1082
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:54,580
All I want is freedom.

1083
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,360
A world with no more night.

1084
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:02,380
And you always beside me.

1085
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:06,220
To hold me and to hide me.

1086
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:14,180
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime.

1087
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:20,380
Let me lead you from your solitude.

1088
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:30,960
Say you'll lead me with you here beside you.

1089
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:36,200
Anywhere you go, let me go.

1090
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:39,220
To Christine.

1091
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:44,360
That's all I ask of you.

1092
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:50,600
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime.

1093
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:56,580
Say the word and I will follow you.

1094
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:06,100
Say you'll stay with me each night, each morning.

1095
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:12,760
Say you'll love me all I do.

1096
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,120
Thanks, Clark.

1097
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:15,940
Love me.

1098
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:21,180
That's all I ask of you.

1099
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,160
Wait, I don't remember that part.

1100
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:25,300
Love, love me.

1101
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:30,840
Okay.

1102
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:35,640
I started laughing because I thought I was going to be singing with him.

1103
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:36,920
Oh.

1104
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:40,660
Why is he looking at me like that?

1105
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:41,540
He wants me to continue?

1106
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:43,980
Oh, here we go.

1107
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:50,340
And you will let me go too.

1108
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,120
Love me.

1109
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,640
That's all I ask of you.

1110
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:58,780
Wait, why are you so quiet?

1111
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,280
Love me.

1112
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,640
Love me.

1113
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:04,620
Love me.

1114
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:11,460
I can't ever sing this song seriously.

1115
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:12,800
Oh, sorry, Clark.

1116
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:14,220
You sang beautifully.

1117
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,560
I was laughing because...

1118
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:19,380
Oh my gosh, I was laughing because...

1119
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:26,400
I thought I was supposed to be singing with him in the chorus, but it was just him.

1120
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,820
I realized because it said...

1121
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,080
Okay, it said like, now we both sing this part.

1122
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,300
And I was like, oh no.

1123
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:36,720
I just sang over him before when I wasn't supposed to.

1124
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,480
It made me laugh.

1125
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:40,180
Whoopsie.

1126
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:41,960
Hopefully that was good enough for you guys.

1127
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,220
Okay, I think I can do one more song.

1128
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:47,240
One more song.

1129
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:49,380
One more song.

1130
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:50,920
One more song.

1131
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,760
I don't know what to sing at all.

1132
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:55,440
And thank you for the donuts, you guys.

1133
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,780
When's the album coming out?

1134
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:57,900
Stop it.

1135
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,900
Stop it.

1136
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,100
Can you do...

1137
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,840
Let me practice it a couple more times.

1138
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,020
Bad apple.

1139
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,240
Golden hour.

1140
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,800
I would have to put the... what's it called?

1141
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:29,700
The pitch up though.

1142
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:32,080
And I can't do that on YouTube.

1143
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,160
But bad apple is a good song.

1144
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:42,260
I never said it was a bad song.

1145
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:53,220
I love you.

1146
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:54,460
I love you.

1147
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:55,740
I love you.

1148
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:58,040
I love you more and more.

1149
01:32:58,220 --> 01:32:59,940
That's also a really hard song for me to sing.

1150
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:00,120
I'm like...

1151
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,320
I have no idea.

1152
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:05,140
Any Toho song?

1153
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:06,980
Any Toho song?

1154
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,220
Any Toho song?

1155
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,060
I ship Mint and Clark now.

1156
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:13,820
Please don't.

1157
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:16,800
Please don't.

1158
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:22,500
Lion?

1159
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:24,440
Not like...

1160
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:26,700
Ba-da-da-da-dun-dun-dun-dun.

1161
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:27,280
That one.

1162
01:33:31,310 --> 01:33:32,310
Oh, I don't know.

1163
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:32,810
Oh, oh my gosh.

1164
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:34,030
Oh, Diamond Crevice.

1165
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:34,390
You know what?

1166
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:38,410
I will sing that one because I was supposed to sing it before.

1167
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:39,390
Oops.

1168
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:45,790
Diamond crevasse karaoke.

1169
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:47,070
There we go.

1170
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:49,730
I was supposed to sing that one.

1171
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:51,050
Someone asked for that one last time.

1172
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:51,630
I said I would.

1173
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:52,690
But...

1174
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:57,150
Okay.

1175
01:33:58,990 --> 01:33:59,630
Break stuff.

1176
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:01,190
I'm not trying to break my throat today.

1177
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:01,830
Okay.

1178
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:02,290
Okay.

1179
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:03,470
We will do it.

1180
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:04,990
We will sing break stuff one day.

1181
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:05,490
Don't worry.

1182
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:06,870
Don't worry.

1183
01:34:07,070 --> 01:34:07,590
Don't worry.

1184
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:08,330
Don't worry.

1185
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:09,890
One day.

1186
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:11,450
One karaoke we'll sing break stuff.

1187
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:20,920

1195
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:32,580

どうならば 満たせるなら 終えるなら I did the wrong part!

1212
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:10,200
その後

最後の曲でした ありがとうございました

1217
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,150
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1218
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:12,150
This was your first time seeing me.

1219
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:12,950
I'm Mint.

1220
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:14,070
I'm a Vtuber.

1221
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:16,070
And I play games and I sing sometimes.

1222
01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:17,970
I'm a spooky ghost.

1223
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:21,670
So if you want to subscribe, that'd be pretty cool.

1224
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:23,870
We have lots of fun here, don't we, guys?

1225
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:26,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1226
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:28,530
Okay, okay, okay.

1227
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:29,970
First time here.

1228
01:40:30,010 --> 01:40:31,050
Shut up, Miguel.

1229
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:37,690
Gracias, gracias.

1230
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:39,190
Muchas gracias.

1231
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:40,750
Arigatou, arigatou.

1232
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:42,250
Arigatou, arigatou.

1233
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:43,370
When...

1234
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,630
Oh, Rock Barabbit, thank you for the okonomiyaki.

1235
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:46,630
Thank you for the karaoke.

1236
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:47,430
Cheered me up a ton.

1237
01:40:47,530 --> 01:40:48,470
I hope you feel better, too.

1238
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:49,910
I can never get enough of your amazing voice.

1239
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:51,530
And I can never express how glad I am.

1240
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:52,170
You're back.

1241
01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:54,050
Mr. Noblesse, thank you so much.

1242
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,150
As I thought, Minto-chan.

1243
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:56,970
You have a good voice.

1244
01:40:58,590 --> 01:40:59,250
Arigatou, uncle.

1245
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:00,750
Thank you, thank you.

1246
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:01,810
Okay.

1247
01:41:06,170 --> 01:41:07,450
Hello, hello.

1248
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:08,770
Goodbye, goodbye.

1249
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:09,870
Bye, bye.

1250
01:41:10,150 --> 01:41:10,950
Thank you, everybody.

1251
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:11,930
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1252
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:12,910
Thank you, see you.

1253
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:14,050
See you when I see...

1254
01:41:14,050 --> 01:41:14,950
Oh, tomorrow I'll have a stream.

1255
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:16,510
I'll be playing a spooky horror game.

1256
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:18,610
So, yes.

1257
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:21,110
Let's play.

1258
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:22,770
Spooky...

1259
01:41:22,770 --> 01:41:23,570
Spooky game.

1260
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:25,410
Bye, bye.

1261
01:41:25,410 --> 01:41:25,970
Bye, bye.

1262
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:26,930
Bye, bye.

1263
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:27,550
Bye, bye.

1264
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:28,210
