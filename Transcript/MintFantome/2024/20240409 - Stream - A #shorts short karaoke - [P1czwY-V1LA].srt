1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,820
Does this work?

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,700
Does this work?

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,180
Am I vertical?

4
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,930
Am I vertical?

5
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,630
Am I wide?

6
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,310
Am I wide?

7
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,090
Am I wide?

8
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,350
I probably could be wide if I really wanted to be.

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,110
Wide, where?

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,770
Hello everybody!

11
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,050
Welcome to Kyoyuki.

12
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,450
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,550
That's not spam, buddy.

14
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,450
Wide.

15
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,070
How do I be wide?

16
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,670
Hold on.

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,560
No, I'm long!

18
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,360
Wrong way!

19
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,170
I don't think I like being long.

20
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,870
I don't know, that's not wide.

21
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,510
That was a big stretch.

22
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,410
Everybody, posture check.

23
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,110
Ready?

24
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,690
Three, two, one.

25
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,570
Poster check, posture check.

26
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,610
Oh, God, I can't stop getting long!

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,920
I'm so loud, I'm so loud.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,260
Anyways, I'm here to sing.

29
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:10,840
Hold on.

30
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,560

one second.

31

any song today?

176
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,260
No, I'm just singing whatever we want.

177
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,200
Oh, J.

178
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,780
Fruits Basket.

179
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,360
Oh my god, that's a good one too.

180
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,060
Okay, I can try and sing this one, but I don't remember it
entirely.

181
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,220
Okay.

182
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,440
I think it'll come back to me if I hear it, you know?

183
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,480
Maybe, we'll see.

184
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,760
Okay, let's shut up Joy Sound.

185
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,500
This one should peek in.

186
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,840
Let me test it.

187
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:28,500
Okay, this sounds a little crunchy, but it kind of adds to
the old school anime vibe.

188
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,600
This isn't even that old of an anime, but.

189
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,830
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

190
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,290
The bass is going crazy.

191
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,230
.

192
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:18,710
.

193
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:18,730
.

194
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:18,750
.

195
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:18,770
.

196
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:18,790
.

197
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:18,810
.

198
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:24,910
Okay,

199
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,070
I don't like this.

200
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,370
I don't like this instrumental at all.

201
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:30,990
Hold on.

202
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:33,890
I'm so sorry.

203
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:34,910
One more time.

204
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,710
This kind of wasn't so good.

205
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:38,750
You know what?

206
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,230
Let me check this one.

207
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,110
Oh, I'm afraid to use.

208
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,550
I'm afraid to use official instrumentals.

209
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,370
I'm afraid that YouTube is going to be like, hey, hey, hey,
no, no, no.

210
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,530
Oh, wait, let me see this one.

211
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,260
Okay, this one works much better.

212
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,760
Sorry, guys.

213
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,300
Radio.

214
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,080
Karaoke Planet.

215
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,360
Instrumental.

216
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,820
What is karaoke planet?

217
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:22,260
Is it like one of those YouTube channels that just has a
bajillion...

218
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:32,560
kiss kiss falling up oh my gosh you know what i've been
thinking of so much recently is the um is the ending for

219
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,920
oron oh my gosh it's so good

220
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,340
it's so good i think i I don't know.

221
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,340
I think I prefer it over the opening.

222
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,220
There's just something about it that's so like nostalgic
sounding about it.

223
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,040
It's so good.

224
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,360
Okay.

225
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,560
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

226
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:13,220
Okay, let's try this again.

227
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,930
I keep turning it up, only to feel like I'm gonna have to
turn it down again.

228
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:49,590
In the day of the morning, the night of the night, the
tiniest day will keep its way down.

229
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:55,950
In the classroom door, go through the room just a little
bit.

230
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:02,150
The morning is on my heart and I can walk out.

231
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:08,910
In such a daily life, the wind is the wind.

232
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:26,590
I heard it, I felt it felt it felt it felt like I felt it
felt like it was now in my own head and I felt it was a

233
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,590
great feeling that a few more stars

234
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:51,630

00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,210
The early days.

279
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,750
It actually was the early days of YouTube.

280
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,430
I'll have to see how this one goes.

281
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,050
I don't remember.

282
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,010
Oh my god, my ears.

283
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,650
It's been so long since I have sang any of these before.

284
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,210
I can't.

285
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:57,690

00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,620
Okay, it's gonna take me a second to get back into it.

288
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,320
Okay, okay, okay.

289
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:12,410
Where is the place where I was at?

290
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,290
That's where I was at.

291
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,410
Where was the place where I was?

292
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:32,510
In your eyes, in the eyes of that day, I found out that I
was looking for the other two.

293
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:34,670
Are you guys like me?

294
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,170
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:46,670
Why do you like so much love me?

296
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:52,170
Your voice, the saddest is heard.

297
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,750
What have you ever been?

298
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,250
What has been your support?

299
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,970
I'm so far away and I'm not...

300
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,400
I don't think I'll remember the rest though.

301
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
Here, we'll do a short version of that one.

302
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,320
We'll just fade, fade, and fade out.

303
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,940
Here, here, I can do eternal snow though.

304
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,720
I know this one better.

305
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,220
Let's test the audio.

306
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,860
Holy bass.

307
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,740
Holy bass.

308
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:40,880
first of a kind my my feelings just going to wakari and you
this this is I don't even I don't know about it, but It's

309
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:50,320
like the snow, but it's just a little bit free.

310
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:59,880
It's a story that's going to go.

311
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:12,120
Hold me tight, I love you, love me, love you.

312
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,120
I love somebody else.

313
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,960
I didn't know it.

314
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,740
I didn't know I love you.

315
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,900

I'm so glad I was so glad.

320
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:04,010
How long have you been thinking about it?

321
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,730
I just want to see how it's going to be.

322
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:15,390
I'm going to use my heart to light up the candle.

323
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:25,890
Now, I'm going to try to get it to go.

324
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,230
I'm going to hold my heart.

325
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,210
I'm going to hold it.

326

Let's sing it, baby.

336
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:44,230
What a thrill with darkness and silence through the night.

337
00:47:48,090 --> 00:48:12,030
thrill I'm searching and I'm melting to you what a fear in
my heart but you're so supreme I give my life not for honor

338
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:34,490
but for you In my time There'll be no one else It's the way
I fly

339
00:48:39,320 --> 00:49:02,920
I'm still in a dream Snake eat up And someday you go through
the rain Someday you feed on a tree rock This ordeal, the

340
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:20,060
trial to survive For the day we see new light I give my life
Not for honor but for you

341
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:29,600
My time There'll be no light

342
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:39,510
It's the way I'm

343
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:53,040
still in our dream, snake it up

could try Sins of the Father Oh my god that song is so hard

352
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:37,010
It was so difficult I've never tried singing it so much But
like when I say that I mean like I tried singing it in my

353
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:45,650
room But I was being quiet Because I didn't know if my
neighbors would be able to hear me In Japan Let's see if

354
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:52,110
that calling to the night I didn't intend on this just being
Metal Gear, but we can try a couple of Metal Gear songs.

355
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,390
Let's do this one.

356
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,090
Let me see if this one's good.

357
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:03,850
Let me try this one.

358
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,680
Oh, no, no, no.

359
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,200
Oh, instrumental.

360
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:11,820
Here we go.

361
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,560
Let me check it.

362
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:14,660
Okay.

363
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,760
Hopefully it's good.

364
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,880
Wait, let me get the lyrics.

365
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:23,580
Calling to the night.

366
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,620
Oh, lyrics.

367
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,560
I forgot to write.

368
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,480
This is from Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.

369
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:32,780
Yes.

370
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,880
Let's see.

371
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:45,330
Might have to adjust the volume a little bit, but that's
okay.

372
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:52,270
What is that sound?

373
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,890
It doesn't sound like that.

374
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:16,150
Through the night to the day, when everything is gone, carry
the soul away from the dry lands.

375
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:36,890
In the sun we see, Fighting over lines All our dreams and
wishes We send home for safekeeping Fighting for what's

376
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:55,740
right I know there's one part I always get the timing off on
So apologies in advance if I don't remember Calling to the

377
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:16,560
night to dream Again in the light Waiting for a storm to
rise And feel the isolation fleeting Calling to the night To

378
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:41,900
be Or not to be Leaving without you, leaving my soul behind
Calling to the night, colors of Kota Grove fade with time

379
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:59,000
Calling to the night for us, for every single time life.

380
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:11,040
All the ashes of men remain as a perfect memory, calling to
the night.

381
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:40,270
As a silhouette of time, hear the, hear the ringing echoes
in the splitting horizon, calling to the night

382
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:58,140
oh that one is so hard oh difficult that was calling to the
night for metal gear solid portable apps it's so it's really

383
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:04,740
tough song though it's hard for me to sing it even let's see
i hope people said sins of the father but

384
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:19,040
i'm gonna say down not as good as Dada Burke at all.

385
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:20,560
Simple and clean?

386
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,760
Okay, we can do that one next.

387
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,420
We'll do that one.

388
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:31,240
Wait, you mean simple and clean English, not what is the
Japanese one?

389
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:31,620
Hikari?

390
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:33,880
Right, right?

391
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:42,380
Wait, Japanese, yeah, which one are both?

392
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,780
Wait, I see a lot of people saying Hikari.

393
00:56:47,040 --> 00:57:01,080
wait no i mean which one should i sing simple and clean or
hikari either one is good either spanish version oh oh i'm

394
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:11,980
gonna run it through google translate and just okay simple
and clean preferred okay i will do simple and clean but

395
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:17,460
before that i will do into the father oh gosh i'm really
nervous about don't okay if you were thinking of clipping

396
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:32,360

okay okay okay oh gosh i think it starts right away wait

397
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:52,080
only when does it start in the deepest nights reaching out
fleeting memory all these thoughts keep piercing this broken

398
00:57:52,080 --> 00:58:17,560
mind I fall but I'm still standing motionless far in the
distance there is light Light that burns these scars of old

399
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:32,520
All this pain reminds me of what I am I'll live, I'll become
all I need to be here Whoa,

400
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,080
whoa, whoa

401
00:58:54,410 --> 00:59:30,890
Words that kill Would you speak them to me With your breath
so still It makes me believe In the Father's sins

402
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:43,070
Let me suffer now and never die I'm alive

403
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,400
Oh this song is so hard, oh my god

404
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:03,770
But I would listen to it all the time in Japan Like walking
to him from home Oh my god, it was like my power anthem

405
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:23,210
But I never got to practice it at karaoke so Pride feeds
their blackened hearts And the thirst must be quenched to

406
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:38,710
fuel hypocrisy Cleansing flames is the only way to repent
Renounce what made you words that kill

407
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:59,950
to me with your breath so still it makes me believe oh god
oh god the sins never die can't wash this blood off our

408
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:10,430
hands let the world fear us all it's just means to an end
our salvation lies

409
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:21,330
In the Father's sins Let me suffer now

410
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:38,960
In my heart I just light up the dark In his eyes

411
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:35,990
Oh gosh I've never sung that at all like like that like I
said whenever I would practice in my room it would be like I

412
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:43,030
would be like as quiet like like without like trying to sing
it but very quietly because I'm like what if my neighbors

413
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:53,600
can hear me what if like I'm like someone's outside and you
just hear me go whoa whoa whoa oh you should keep practicing

Rules of nature!

423
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,560
For the first time singing it, actually it sounded great.

424
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:57,760
Would woho again.

425
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,920
Those wohoes are really hard to...

426
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,840
And like, I love how Donna Burke, her voice, like, gets so
raspy.

427
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:09,460
So I, like, try to kind of do that, but I'm not good at it.

428
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,300
But, like, she has, like, such a powerful voice.

429
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,900
So I feel like mine is completely...

430
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:25,660
pales in comparison but that's okay it's all for fine right
i'm not a professional here where's this here for fine um

431
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:29,340
let me check up this one's good for simple and clean

432
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:44,040

mean like the don't know oh wait there's this guy Nashi okay

435
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:17,110

let's listen to this one

436
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:46,490
Please, oh baby, don't go Simple and clean as the way that
you're making me feel tonight It's hard to let it go You're

437
01:05:46,490 --> 01:06:09,730
giving me too many things lately You're all I need Oh, you
smiled at me And said, don't get me wrong, I love you But

438
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:26,400
does that mean I have to meet your father When we are older,
you're not And I said, no, I don't think life is quite that

439
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:44,700
simple away you don't hear me say please oh baby don't go
simple and clean it's the way that you're making me feel

440
01:06:44,700 --> 01:07:02,540
tonight it's hard to let it go so simple and clean oh the
daily things like this and that What is what that keeps us

441
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,760
all busy?

442
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,300
Are confusing me?

443
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:22,960
That's when you came to me and said, Wish I could prove I
love you, but does that mean I have to walk a water?

444
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:29,380
When we are older, you'll understand it's enough.

445
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:47,500
When I say so And maybe some things are that simple When you
walk away You don't hear me say Please, oh baby Don't go,

446
01:07:47,760 --> 01:08:03,880
simple and clean Is the way that you're making me feel
tonight It's hard to let it go Oh my god, my throat It's

447
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:20,240
morning is a little later on Regardless of warnings, the
future doesn't scare me at all Nothing's like before When

448
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:36,700
you walk away, you don't hear me say Please, oh baby, Don't
go, simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel

449
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:37,560
tonight.

450
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:41,000
It's hard to let it go.

451
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:51,080
Hold me, whatever lies beyond this morning is a little later
on.

452
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:57,800
Regardless of warnings, the future doesn't scare me at all.

453
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:15,680
Nothing's like before Hold me Whatever lies beyond this
morning Is a little later on Regardless of warnings The

454
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:28,780
future doesn't scare me at all Nothing's like before That's
a lie The future does scare me

455
01:09:33,780 --> 01:10:01,920
I'm still recovering, recovering from a cold so I can't hit
high notes so easily right now.

456
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:05,620
So I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

457
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:11,680
Yay!

458
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,760
That was simple and clean.

459
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,200
Simple and clean.

460
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,300
Could have fooled me.

461
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,600
What do you mean can't hit high notes?

462
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:26,580
I mean, I said I can't hit them as well.

463
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,860
Oh my gosh, good playlist.

464
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,220
Thank you for the 70.

465
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:29,840
Oh my gosh.

466
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,260
Dangment, your voice is so powerful.

467
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,580
Thanks for spoiling us with your voice.

468
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,680
Your voice is peaceful, soothing, and beautiful.

469
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:36,540
Thank you.

470
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,400
Thank you so, so much.

471
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,540
Thank you guys for all the doughnuts.

472
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,080
Thank you.

473
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:40,540
Thank you.

474
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,380
Thank you.

475
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:42,580
Huh.

476
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,260
What could be next?

477
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:52,080
I can go for probably like another 20 minutes or so, so we
can do a couple more songs.

478
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,260
Songs.

479
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,410
I cannot borderline.

480
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,320
Okay, okay, okay.

481
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:01,080
I cannot.

482
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,040
Space Odyssey.

483
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,380
Oh my gosh, you know that not Space Odyssey.

484
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:18,100
Been singing this actually, sorry, I'm going to sing
something too that I want to sing also.

485
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:28,580

taste of my childhood it's mine too it's mine too free run

486
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:38,360
ed oh my gosh that makes me want to bring up something okay
sorry i have a super unbased taste or unbased opinion i okay

487
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:45,540
so the other day i did karaoke and someone requested one of
the free run songs and i didn't recognize it and someone in

488
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:59,280
the comments was like she said you were in but she didn't
even know the name of the song i'm sorry i don't like well

489
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:08,960
okay the op is not as bad the ed i really love the chorus of
the ed but i cannot oh my god the song starts and i i'm so

490
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:20,540
sorry i'm i'm sorry i'm sorry oh no one of those types of no
no i am not I am typically not one of those types of people.

491
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:27,100
I am almost always a true believer in listening to the
opening and the ending every time.

492
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,000
But not the best Millet.

493
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,140
Millet, Millet is how you pronounce it?

494
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,860
Like when she starts and she goes, it's all right.

495
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,400
And then in the background, it goes, yeah, but I'm all
right.

496
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:41,920
I'm okay.

497
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:42,960
Yeah, I'm okay.

498
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,340
I just can't.

499
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,300
I can't.

500
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:59,760
can't I just oh there's something about it that really
literally like grates my spine like the chorus though is so

501
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:06,280
beautiful and I love it so much but just the beginning of
the song makes me be like okay next episode I'm sorry well

502
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:17,730
when you put it like that honestly fair I'm sorry I'm sorry
that it is an unbased opinion but you know I'm so based all

503
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:23,310
the time I have to have some unbased opinions right i can't
be perfect you guys geez

504
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:36,750
but this song this song is perfect You can see it.

505
01:13:37,130 --> 01:14:00,210
Tingo fire, Bible white power, Tiger, tiger,
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

506
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:05,750
Look at each other, love love, love love, love each other
and look at them.

507
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:12,050
But I want to know more than I want to know, I'm so nervous
about it.

508
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:18,130
As I look at all the more weirds and as I think they become
so much more intense.

509
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:22,550
So I'm more into the unkind of the world.

510
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:37,330
Yeah, ah Love, love, love, love Love, love Love, love I
believe But it's so, so close, I'm gonna get it, it's gonna

511
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:50,610
be so Giri, giri, Giri, I can't go down Borderline, I can't
even see everything I can't see everything Giri, giri, giri,

512
01:14:50,610 --> 01:15:04,950
Hi, Hi, Sarnalji, your mind My body is un- My body is un-
Unable I'll say it's-hallow Hey

513
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:24,970

person And I want to see you again For the day I'm glad to

514
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:32,650

it's a big thing to see.

515
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:33,490
It's a big thing to see.

516
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,450
It's a dangerous line.

517
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:50,970
Ah, it's free, free, free, free, free, but if you don't
stop, stop, stop, stop, then you're gonna die, you're gonna

518
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:52,930
die.

519
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:59,410
Gini, gini, I'm a very dangerous,

520
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:27,210
One of my favorite things about this song is when they play
it at like any kura, like any anime song events.

521
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:34,770
When the chorus comes, people will break UOs, which are
really bright glow sticks and just it's called it's called

522
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:43,320
cycloning they just they just swirl them around a lot it's
so fun giri giri ai can't i pull that line

524
01:17:33,180 --> 01:18:05,310
Look, the eyes work with it because of the song matter.

525
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:08,030
Sneaky.

526
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:25,530
not the giddy giddy eyes sure I'm serious I'm serious I'm
dead serious I'm always dead serious I'm dead serious

527
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:40,070
let's see what else what else thank you for the don't know
thank you it'd be interesting to sing hear you sing ace

528
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:48,170
combat songs when day maybe one day my partner heard you
kahan san ran into ikina borderline from the other room and

529
01:18:48,170 --> 01:19:01,090
he said i'm glad she's back on her bullshit what do you mean
by that also shrimp thank you for the six jana thank you for

work oh good luck with work good luck good luck good luck

531
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:16,140
i'm gonna try singing this song it's not a japan or it's not
a anime song, I'm sorry.

532
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:22,880
But maybe, it's obviously, we can do whatever we want.

533
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:25,260
We don't have to do just anime songs, so.

534
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:30,580
I saw someone asking for Phantom of the Opera, but I
honestly don't think my voice can handle it today.

535
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,800
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see.

536
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,540
Maybe I can.

537
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:34,160
Who knows?

538
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,680
This song, I'm gonna try and do.

539
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:39,000
Usually I sing it.

540
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,880
Actually, maybe I shouldn't sing it.

541
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:41,400
I don't know.

542
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,420
Let me, I don't know.

543
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,660
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't sing this.

544
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,260
Maybe my voice isn't good for this either.

545
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:47,840
I don't know.

546
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:53,450
I don't know.

547
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:56,490
Uh, you know what, whatever.

548
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:57,810
I can sing whatever I want.

549
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:59,530
Do it, Mick, Gamba, okay.

550
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:02,350
Take a break and sing Tequila.

551
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:06,890
No, we only have, I only plan on singing not very much
longer anyway, so.

552
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:08,190
Just have fun.

553
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:09,670
Yeah, we're just having fun with it.

554
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:11,050
You can sing whatever you want.

555
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:11,570
Yeah!

556
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:15,330
But, uh, yeah, I'll try it.

557
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:15,870
I'll try it.

558
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:23,210
sound good I'm really sorry but I love this song this is
another song that I would listen on repeat all the time when

559
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:28,310
I was in Japan so I'm basically singing a couple of my
comfort songs well since of the father was a comfort song

560
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:40,390
this is a comfort song what else did I listen to sing the
carpenter song was a car comfort song so okay I'm gonna try

561
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:51,130
and sing this one this is Mariana Cross by Ghost.

562
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:56,310
But I can't tell if the key will be okay for me.

563
01:20:57,070 --> 01:20:57,790
We'll see.

564
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:04,590
We were speeding together down the dark avenues.

565
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:12,310
But besides all the stardom, all we got was blues.

566
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:19,130
But through all the sorrow, we were riding hard.

567
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:29,110
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you
go.

568
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:34,770
We were scanning the cities, walking to greater dues.

569
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:42,290
But besides all the glamour, all we got was bruised.

570
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:49,030
But through all the sorrow, we were riding high.

571
01:21:50,970 --> 01:22:01,690
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you
go.

572
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:10,150
You go down just like Holy Mary, Mariana, Mariana Cross.

573
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:17,470
Not just another bloody Mary, Mariana, Mariana Cross.

574
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:22,110
choose to run away with me.

575
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,270
I will tickle you internally.

576
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:30,930
And I see nothing wrong with that.

577
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:43,630
Marineris Oz.

578
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:52,350
We were searching for reasons to play by the rules.

579
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:59,410
But we quickly found out it It's just for fools.

580
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:07,110
But the wrong, the sorrow will be riding high.

581
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:15,610
And the truth of the matter is I'll never let you go, let
you go.

582
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:19,750
Never gonna let you go, chat.

583
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:27,410
You go down just like Holy Mary.

584
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:42,830
Mariana, Mariana Cross, not just another bloody Mary,
Mariana, Mariana, Mariana, you go down just like Holy Mary,

585
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:57,510
Mariana, Mariana Cross, your beauty never ever scared me,
Mariana, Mariana, Mariana Cross, if you choose to run.

586
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:59,030
away with me.

587
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:02,090
I will tickle you internally.

588
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:09,050
And I see nothing wrong with that.

589
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:21,570
Nothing wrong with that.

590
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:26,790
I can't help.

591
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:28,350
