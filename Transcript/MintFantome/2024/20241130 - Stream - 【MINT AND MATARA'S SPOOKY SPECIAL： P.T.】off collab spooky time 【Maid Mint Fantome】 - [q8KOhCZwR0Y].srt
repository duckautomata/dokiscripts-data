1
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,170
Let's test audio.

2
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,890
Please get out of my body, please!

3
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,950
It's a body!

4
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,210
She's taking me over.

5
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,710
Help!

6
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,350
Help!

7
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:51,970
Help!

8
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,390
It's a man!

9
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,610
Look, I can wink.

10
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,530
No!

11
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,950
Stop!

12
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,270
I'm taking over the body!

13
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,000
It's horrible.

14
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,580
Can you all hear me close enough or should I come closer?

15
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,100
Go a little closer.

16
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,360
Sorry.

17
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,680
You want me to come a little closer to you?

18
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,780
Not to me.

19
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:24,920
No.

20
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,800
Please get out.

21
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,520
Welcome to the maid cafe.

22
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,180
Oh, now you're in my body!

23
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,420
No.

24
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,220
Oh, you are?

25
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,380
No, it's only you.

26
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,680
It's only you.

27
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,760
No, you can.

28
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,660
Here, possess me.

29
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,160
Hi, honey.

30
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,720
She's possessing me!

31
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,420
Wisps!

32
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,820
Wisps, help me, please!

33
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,980
Please help me!

34
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,840
Sorry, guys.

35
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:57,220
This is just how it's going to be when you're in the vicinity of a space cockroach and a ghost.

36
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,800
It's just strange things happen.

37
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,980
Can I call Mint a stinky?

38
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,460
Yes.

39
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,000
For $20, I will call her a stinky.

40
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,860
I'll give you a bargain.

41
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,560
For $20, I will call also both her cats stinky.

42
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,940
Okay, but I don't need any money for that.

43
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,280
You know.

44
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,440
Also, can I please call you out on this?

45
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,800
So, her monitor is very big and her chat room where she reads the Wisps is so small.

46
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,100
Deal?

47
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,600
It's not even that small!

48
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,080
Stinky!

49
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,080
Hi, Matara.

50
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,920
Please call her stinky.

51
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,280
Stinky!

52
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,440
See?

53
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,200
You're still able to read it.

54
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,920
But I'm focusing on it.

55
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,260
Y'all don't understand.

56
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,300
Oh, so she's saying she doesn't focus on you guys.

57
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,600
I have to...

58
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,280
I don't know them.

59
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,660
They're strangers to me.

60
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:40,940
What?

61
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,920
I don't know these guys.

62
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,020
I'm not parasocial with them.

63
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,740
I'm parasocial with the momos.

64
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,440
There are 100% momos in this chat.

65
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,800
Also, stinky!

66
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:50,980
Stinky!

67
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,040
Stinky!

68
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,280
I'm calling you stinky.

69
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,220
Stinky!

70
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:54,740
Stinky!

71
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:54,880
Stinky!

72
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,440
You're like the little sibling that's playing along but you don't know what we're saying.

73
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,600
Stinky!

74
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,260
Stinky!

75
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,980
Stinky!

76
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:03,840
Mint stinky!

77
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,000
Thank you, everybody.

78
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,820
What do you think of my setup besides judging my monitor sense?

79
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,180
Well, I think it's very cute.

80
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,360
I think your setup is very cute.

81
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,160
I think your whole room is very cute.

82
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,860
I like every... I told you, I think you have a lot of really, really nice stuff in here.

83
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,280
My favorite is probably the Ketopi cinema roll with Metal Gear.

84
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,260
I love it.

85
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,100
I have a plushie of cinema roll dressed up in Ketopi's clothes.

86
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,820
Like the Sunreal characters.

87
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,540
But then he has the Metal Gear headband on.

88
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,560
Momos represent.

89
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,400
Thank you, Elena.

90
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,320
Also, mint stinky.

91
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,740
No, I just feel like your chat room is just so tiny compared to your monitor.

92
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,560
My chat room takes up like half my monitor.

93
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,800
Okay, you guys, she opens her chat, like she pops it out.

94
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,540
Yeah, and I make it bigger.

95
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,740
And then she like, yeah.

96
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,920
I control F.

97
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,040
It's not control F.

98
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I do that on my keyboard.

99
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,100
Okay, well, I zoomed.

100
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,780
But now, see, there's less messages.

101
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,640
But that's the thing.

102
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,320
You pop it out and you make it like... I make it like this big.

103
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,000
It takes up like this.

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,460
Yeah, but then I can't see my OBS.

105
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,140
I don't need to see your OBS.

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,160
I need to see my OBS.

107
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,340
It's your house.

108
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,400
It's your kingdom.

109
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,720
You are stinky.

110
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,920
The momos are minted.

111
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,840
By the way, I didn't miss any stinkies, did I?

112
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,000
Is somebody keeping track?

113
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,000
Mint stinky, just in case I missed one.

114
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,720
Stinky, extra stinky.

115
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,580
Extra stinky.

116
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,540
Oh my goodness, I have to say about one of your cats.

117
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,240
I felt so bad.

118
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,000
Yesterday, she just kept staying in my legs.

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:46,620
Yeah, so basically, if you sleep with your legs bent, she likes to sleep in the back of your knees.

120
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,700
One time, I had my legs closed, right?

121
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,900
Just laying stick figure man emoji.

122
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,200
And she pried my legs open to lay in between my legs.

123
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,840
She forces her way into any little...

124
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,880
Go ahead.

126
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,920
No, she... so I like... I move...

127
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,280
Also, sorry everybody, I just woke up, so I need a second to kind of awaken.

128
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,920
Oh, yeah, they know.

129
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,600
She was in my legs.

130
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,300
She was in my legs and then I moved to, you know, move myself because I didn't realize she was sleeping there.

131
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,180
She goes, meow.

132
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,280
But she's upset with me for moving and I'm like, you came into my space.

133
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:25,940
No, no, no.

134
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,120
And that's what it is.

135
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,520
That's the difference of having a cat.

136
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,780
Like when you have a cat, you know that the cat is... that's their domain.

137
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,300
Oh, stinky.

138
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,380
Oh, am I getting too loud?

139
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:39,680
Yeah.

140
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,540
Oh, sorry.

141
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,220
Stinky.

142
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,760
Stinky mint.

143
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,360
Stinky.

144
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,300
Stinky mint.

145
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,700
Stinky.

146
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,600
Also, yesterday I sent Mint like two videos.

147
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,180
So both cats were in my bed, which was fine.

148
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,100
I was just on TikTok.

149
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,560
And then they both started licking each other.

150
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,320
Yeah, that's what cats do.

151
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,440
And they kept licking each other for a long time.

152
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,940
And I was like, nice.

153
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,300
Good for you guys.

154
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,760
Yeah, they were...

155
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,980
What is it my turn to get licked?

156
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:06,840
Oh.

157
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Sorry, I just beat the mic.

158
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:15,100
Yeah, I made the settings for the mic to stay here.

159
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,300
Why did you pick it up?

160
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,400
Mint, what is it my turn to get licked?

161
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,560
I can't stare up.

162
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,280
I can't look at you.

163
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,680
So it's a dominance thing?

165
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,120
Who's licking who?

166
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,560
Like...

167
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,600
The one who licks is the dominant one.

168
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,140
And the licky is the...

169
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,940
Is the submissive one.

170
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,280
So basically they're fighting.

171
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,260
They were arguing.

172
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,360
They were like in mid-battle in your bed.

173
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,540
You know?

174
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,780
And I was just...

175
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,040
I'm like, okay guys, enjoy.

176
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,100
Licky.

177
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,480
Mm-hmm.

178
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,640
Licky, licky, licky.

179
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,880
I do have to say one of your cats is definitely stinky.

180
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,700
They're both very stinky.

181
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,720
I think all cats kind of smell a bit.

182
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,780
I think that's very normal.

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,400
But one of your cats went number two.

184
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,080
And I was sitting like...

185
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,380
Again, it's very normal.

186
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,740
If anybody's ever had a cat...

187
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,180
When a cat goes to the bathroom, it's gonna smell for a second.

188
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,600
But your cat...

189
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,560
I even told you.

190
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,120
I was like, you know what?

191
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,980
Let's go for lunch.

192
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,220
Let's get out of here.

193
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,980
We did leave the house.

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,100
I was like, this is atomic.

195
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,800
To be fair, she has...

196
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,660
Yeah.

197
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,760
She has butt issues.

198
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,600
Yeah, she has tummy issues and stuff.

199
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,820
So it is very valid.

200
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,800
But yeah, it was to the point where I said...

201
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,280
I'm like, you know what?

202
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,780
Let's go for lunch a little early.

203
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,720
It was not...

204
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,160
It was a little crazy.

205
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,740
It was a little...

206
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,300
Yeah, sorry for my stinky cat.

207
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,220
Can you call me stinky?

208
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,220
Stinky.

209
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,140
Stinky.

210
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:41,900
Stinky.

211
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,620
Stinky.

212
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,080
Oh my God, it feels weird possessing your body.

213
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,220
What are these?

214
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,240
Do you feel your...

215
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,920
Look, because you're possessing me, it's making you lean forward.

216
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,100
I know.

217
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,640
Here, momos.

218
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,640
This is what you wanted.

219
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,320
Stop.

220
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,640
Stop.

221
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,580
Someone's just like, play the game.

222
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,480
Oh yeah, do you chat a lot before you play games?

223
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,040
Depends.

224
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,640
I've chatted...

225
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,540
I've chatted sometimes between like 30 minutes.

226
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,480
But sometimes it depends.

227
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,540
You're tired.

228
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,660
You also have...

229
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,480
Demons in my brain.

230
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,820
You do have demons in your brain.

231
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,540
I want to do my laundry, everybody.

232
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,520
That's basically...

233
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,020
I want to like do a lot of laundry.

234
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,260
Yeah, she wants to wash her underwear.

235
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,480
And my socks.

236
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,440
It's like the worst thing.

237
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,920
I'm going to have to disinfect my washing machine after this.

238
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,380
I want to wash my socks.

239
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,840
Socks.

240
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:56,440
But other than that, without going too much into detail, Thanksgiving was great.

241
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,220
I had a great time.

242
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,400
Oh, something really funny happened today.

243
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,980
Okay, so yesterday I met your grandmother.

244
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,540
Yeah.

245
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,680
She asked me to call her by a nickname, which I started right away.

246
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,540
It's my grandma's gang name.

247
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:08,920
Yeah.

248
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,620
Oh, that's why.

249
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:10,760
Okay.

250
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,460
So I've been calling her by her gang name and it was great.

251
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:13,880
Awesome.

252
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,660
That's why she was like really excited that someone was calling her by her gang name.

253
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,680
Oh, by her gang name.

254
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,340
I see, I see.

255
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,660
So when I first was asking where she's from, she says, yes.

256
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,340
And then she tells me where she's from and she goes...

257
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,380
She goes, guess?

258
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,080
Sorry, I know I'm interrupting.

259
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,860
No, no, go, go, go.

260
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,540
Please, you're doing great.

261
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,080
But she's like, guess.

262
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,580
And then you're like, you didn't hear her at first.

263
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,260
And you were like, what?

264
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:33,760
Oh.

265
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,420
And then you realize and you're like, oh.

266
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,500
And then my grandma just immediately just says...

267
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,360
She doesn't even give you a minute to guess.

268
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,780
But she then...

269
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,500
The first thing she says about the place where she's from and she's like, the drugs are really good there.

270
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,640
And I was like, yeah, I bet.

271
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,200
I bet.

272
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,580
My grandma's pure.

273
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,820
Don't say that about my grandma.

274
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,360
No, but my favorite thing happened today.

275
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,200
We saw her grandmother again.

276
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,980
And because, you know, that's what two women do when they're about to get married and be in love.

277
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,520
So we saw her grandmother again.

278
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,640
And as she came in, I was like, oh, hi, Cookie, which is just how I call her.

279
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,520
It's kind of her nickname.

280
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,400
And she just looks at me, looks at Mint, looks over at like other people.

281
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,900
And just you can tell she has no idea who I am.

282
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,060
Because I was waiting for my sister.

283
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,840
She had no idea.

284
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,660
She looked at everybody like, who's this bitch?

285
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,980
Yeah, she was like, who the hell?

286
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,860
She was so... and then at the end...

287
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,540
I thought it was really funny that you... so my sister announced she was pregnant.

288
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,440
And I thought it was really funny that you were just like, oh, yeah.

289
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,240
And by the way, Mint and I are a couple.

290
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,920
To my mom.

291
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,980
And she was like, what is going on?

292
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,140
And I was like, no!

293
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:57,540
No!

294
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,860
It was just absolute chaos.

295
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,200
I wanted to leave immediately.

296
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,360
And that... another thing.

297
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,880
So today, after you and I were leaving, your grandmother went, oh, you were here?

298
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:10,880
Oh, yeah.

299
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,240
My grandma then looks at me and she goes, Mint?

300
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,880
I was like, yeah, grandma.

301
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,120
And she's like, you were here the whole time?

302
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,440
Yeah, grandma, I was here.

303
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,820
I learned something, though, about her catchphrase.

304
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
There was a phrase that she said once.

305
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,500
Where she said, if you come up behind me, you better fight me or fuck me.

306
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,300
And she...

307
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,980
Yeah, guys, I'm basically Akarin from YuruYuri, if you know.

308
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,620
If you know, you know.

309
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,760
If you know, you know.

310
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,780
Anyway, my grandma once said that.

311
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,860
And I told it to my sister.

312
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,520
I was just like, man, I once said that to some people.

313
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,780
And they thought it was really funny.

314
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,820
And my sister told me some extra lore about that.

315
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,840
And she said...

316
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,360
My grandma has said that before.

317
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,680
But she has said that she learned it.

318
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,500
I won't say who.

319
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,240
But she learned it from a famous serial killer.

320
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,100
Who she once talked to.

321
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,380
And the guy...

322
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,940
It was crazy.

323
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,100
The guy was just like, yeah.

324
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,220
That's how you have to live your life.

325
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,660
And I'm like...

326
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,780
There are famous serial killers.

327
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,340
Like, I've heard of this person.

328
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

329
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,720
So...

330
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,300
Grandma!

331
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,540
Man, your grandma is so cool.

332
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,540
She loved me.

333
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,880
When she did remember me, she loved me.

334
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,300
She asked me to kiss her.

335
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,020
Yeah, my grandma did ask for a kiss.

336
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,740
As I was leaving, I gave her a little hug and a head shake.

337
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,980
And she was like, can I get a kiss?

338
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,660
But she was like, I don't get a kiss or something.

339
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,820
It was like either one of those.

340
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,740
No, no, she asked for a kiss.

341
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,120
She asked for a kiss.

342
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,540
The thing is, my lips are a little chapped.

343
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,940
So I've been using chapstick.

344
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,780
But if they weren't chapped, I'd give her a kiss on the lips.

345
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,440
Make her happy in her last few years, you know?

346
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,660
Yeah, if you want to come back.

347
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,580
I mean, you were like, I'm coming back next year.

348
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,420
Oh yeah, your mom misunderstood.

349
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,700
She's like, you're coming for Christmas?

350
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,080
I'm like, no, no, no, no.

351
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,220
It was really fun.

352
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,960
I do have to say, it was very funny when your sister gave the announcement.

353
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,720
The way she made it sound was she talked about a pet.

354
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,600
And she was like, oh, this pet is getting a sibling or something.

355
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,500
And your reaction was, the pet is pregnant?

356
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,000
And I knew, I was like, oh, she's pregnant.

357
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,300
Instantly, like I said it.

358
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,460
And it's like, you were just like, wow, you're getting another pet?

359
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,780
You were like, the pet is pregnant?

360
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,600
I love that pet though.

361
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,600
I love that pet.

362
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:54,940
It was great.

363
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,160
Thank you for having me over.

364
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,060
It was a good time.

365
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,580
Did you like American Thanksgiving?

366
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,720
It was great.

367
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,540
Even though it was like very non-traditional?

368
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,200
No, but I saw people's photos.

369
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,640
We had the casserole, which is super.

370
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,440
The green bean thing.

371
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,120
We had the sweet potato thing.

372
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,200
We had the turkey and the cranberry sauce.

373
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,280
That's like all Thanksgiving is, no?

374
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,540
Oh, yeah.

375
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,160
Sometimes my mom would make a stuffing.

376
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,780
There was like no stuffing.

377
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,360
We did have pie, but also we bought macaroons.

378
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,280
Can we get the entire Mint family's first impressions of Matara?

379
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,680
I mean, I think your grandma liked me.

380
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,200
The times that she remembered me, she liked me.

381
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,980
My mom really liked you.

382
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
She thought you were really funny.

383
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,460
I get that a lot.

384
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,100
My sister probably had no...

385
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,480
Probably no strong opinion.

386
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,440
Your sister is like living her life in her own land.

387
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,500
She does her own thing.

388
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,840
Her afterlife is crazy.

389
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,380
Yeah.

390
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,420
I think the pet liked me, too.

391
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,480
I think your pets like me.

392
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,200
Yeah?

393
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,960
Yeah, they keep cuddling in my bed.

394
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,880
Yeah, that's because that's a place they don't usually get to sleep.

395
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,460
It's because I'm there.

396
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,020
No.

397
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,000
It's because I'm there.

398
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,800
It's because your bed is usually a couch that instead she likes to...

399
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,120
Pies will like grab it.

400
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,920
But yeah, Mata is taller than my entire family is.

401
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,640
Yeah, that's true.

402
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,020
Well, I mean, you're like a space bug.

403
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,960
Yeah, I'm a tall cockroach.

404
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,880
I'm like a six feet tall cockroach, obviously.

405
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
I'm taller than everybody.

406
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,640
Yeah.

407
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,720
Was your...

408
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,980
Was your mother's husband very tall?

409
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,260
No.

410
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,520
I really went around that one.

411
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,220
No.

412
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
It was great.

413
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,700
It was a lot of fun and everybody was very nice and polite and it was nice.

414
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,600
It was a good time.

415
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,020
I have to say, like, I think it's really good that I was there.

416
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,080
Because otherwise, like, your sister was a little late to dinner.

417
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,300
Oh, yeah.

418
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,840
She was like three hours late.

419
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,600
Yeah, I would have just been there with my mom and my grandma.

420
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,840
Yeah, so...

421
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,040
Just sitting there.

422
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,920
So it was nice that, like, you know...

423
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,320
Yeah.

424
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,460
So, yeah, I wanted to go home.

425
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:23,980
She did.

426
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,480
I was ready to leave as soon as I walked through the door.

427
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,080
She did.

428
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,600
She did.

429
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:28,960
Yeah.

430
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,640
But then we went out and we had fun today.

431
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,060
Yep.

432
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,600
And we went shopping a little.

433
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,560
Shopping.

434
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,760
We bought some skincare, which is always fun.

435
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,060
We bought some skincare.

436
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,540
We bought some snackies.

437
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,460
Snackies!

438
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,520
I have some bubble tea.

439
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,300
I have bubble tea, too.

440
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,440
Yeah.

441
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,080
And we're about to play a scary game.

442
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,020
I just... I need y'all to know, I might not finish.

443
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,720
Like, you probably will have to finish for me.

444
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,700
No, I think I wrote here...

445
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,820
Matara is a baby, so we may not finish.

446
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,120
We'll see how far she gets.

447
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,700
Listen, it's rare that I get to finish, so...

448
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,060
Scary video game.

449
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,560
I finish sentences, too, huh?

450
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,880
Yeah, I meant scary video games.

451
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,040
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

452
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,560
What was... where did I get scared with you that you're like, oh...

453
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,240
Oh, we were watching a stream and this guy was playing, like...

454
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,520
It's kind of like I'm on observation duty type of game.

455
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,860
It was like an exit eight.

456
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,100
Yeah.

457
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,240
Yeah, yeah, which is also observation duty.

458
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,660
And there was, like, a few jump scares.

459
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,920
And they would get me every time.

460
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,940
You would lunge at me.

461
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,560
You'd be like...

462
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,780
But, yeah.

463
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,460
Also, no, I'm possessing Matara, so we can't fix the feature.

464
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,940
There's actually... that was part of the technical issues.

465
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,680
And I just said, screw it.

466
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,580
So, sorry.

467
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:49,980
Sorry.

468
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,520
Is this or I am just a pinch on screen.

469
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,380
Yeah, pretty much.

470
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,640
So, you guys...

471
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,280
Yeah, pick one.

472
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,200
Beggars can't be choosers, everybody.

473
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:00,740
Agreed.

474
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,880
Okay, thank you.

475
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,000
Sorry, I'm really salty about it because I've spent a lot of time trying to fix it.

476
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,660
She did.

477
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,180
I had a great time.

478
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,220
I took a nap.

479
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,240
Yeah, she didn't do anything.

480
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,720
And then I sat here.

481
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:13,940
I did all the work.

482
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:20,600
And now people are paying you for me to call you Stinky, which again, reminder, $20 and I call men Stinky.

483
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,340
Oh.

484
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

485
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,660
It's a bargain deal for today only.

486
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,340
Oh, Black Friday deal, everybody.

487
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:27,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

488
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,680
Buy one, get one Stinky.

489
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,120
That's good.

490
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,300
Spend $20, get one Stinky.

491
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,000
What else?

492
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,900
There's like...

493
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,600
Again, I'm very...

494
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,260
Like, we didn't do much.

495
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,120
All I did was I came over.

496
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,880
I took a ton of naps.

497
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,680
I ate all your snacks.

498
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,240
Yeah.

499
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,320
I cuddled your cats.

500
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,040
You slept a lot.

501
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,920
I slept a lot.

502
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,540
But I'm tired.

503
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,140
I barely slept in the previous part of my trip.

504
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,860
Yeah, she spent all...

505
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,160
She was just like, oh, yeah, I hung out with my actual friends, so I'm gonna go to Mint's place.

506
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,300
And now I'm gonna just sleep the day away.

507
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,540
Mint, you're Stinky.

508
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,620
Mint, you're Stinky.

509
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,620
Mint, you're Stinky.

510
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,700
Mint, you're Stinky.

511
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,840
Mint, you're Stinky.

512
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,120
Mint, you're Stinky.

513
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,640
Stinky.

514
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,380
Not Stinky.

515
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,800
You could be if I spell things.

516
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,820
Mint, you're Stinky.

517
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,360
Yeah, it's a special one.

518
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,000
See who it's from.

519
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,360
I know, I saw.

520
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,260
We're doing a Eurobeat song for Christmas.

521
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,740
Oh, my God.

522
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,540
Spoilers.

523
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:22,980
It's Last Christmas.

524
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,600
Oh, they know.

525
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,280
It's because she fundraised $15,000 for charity.

526
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,760
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

527
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,740
The very next, Mint, you're Stinky, you need a part.

528
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,240
This year, Mint, you're Stinky, save you from tears.

529
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,520
Give it to someone special.

530
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,880
Yeah, no, and I told you.

531
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,960
It's one of those things where I feel...

532
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,480
I feel like when you're kind of new friends with somebody, you always feel like you gotta entertain them and you gotta be on your best behavior.

533
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,320
But when you're really close friends...

534
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,660
At one point, we were sitting watching a stream and I just looked at Mint and I said, Sorry, I'm being quiet.

535
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,600
I know.

536
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,720
Also, Mint, you're Stinky, Mint, you're Stinky.

537
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:07,180
No, I was so blessed in that moment.

538
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,180
I thought I was gonna go back to heaven because I was just like, Wow, she shut up for five minutes.

539
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,020
Maybe I should just...

540
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,380
Here, I'll just go down here.

541
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,920
And then it's not like...

542
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,320
You're like a little baby.

543
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,520
Then it looks like your stream, but I'm just kind of chilling here.

544
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,080
So cute.

545
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,380
Yeah.

546
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,060
I love it.

547
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,460
Or I can sit upon your teat.

548
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,920
Upon my teat?

549
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,520
Yay!

550
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,520
Wow.

551
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,460
I'm just wedged in there.

552
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,400
I think you should be a little bigger.

553
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,240
Okay.

554
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:43,980
Okay.

555
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,540
Yeah, honestly, I've just been kind of like disassociating a lot.

556
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,200
Just chilling, relaxing.

557
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,920
I keep getting people...

558
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,720
I told Mint, I had so many people message me for Thanksgiving.

559
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,380
Also, Mint, you're Stinky.

560
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,760
And it was all very nice.

561
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,200
It was all like, Oh, you know, not happy birthday.

562
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,940
Happy Thanksgiving, et cetera, et cetera.

563
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,560
And I just opened the message.

564
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,820
And I'm like, Oh, I'll get to it when I go back.

565
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,240
Wait, what did you say?

566
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,660
I disassociated.

567
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:19,860
Where like, even if people are messaging me on Discord or anything or Twitter, I'm like, Oh, I'll get to this next week.

568
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,340
I really needed chill time for the brain.

569
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, you...

570
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,580
I've been...

571
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,860
Honestly, I was like, I wonder if this stream is going to happen.

572
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,180
I'm down.

573
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:29,900
Yeah.

574
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,420
All right, fix your brightness.

575
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,860
Left and right.

576
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,000
I knew that.

577
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,400
I need to see a little bit because I am blind.

578
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,300
Why don't you get glasses?

579
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:47,640
Because.

580
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,780
Because.

581
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,480
Watch out, the gap in the door.

582
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,680
It's a separate reality.

583
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,740
The only me is me.

584
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,340
Are you sure the only you is you?

585
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,840
Also, Mint, you're Stinky.

586
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,000
Stinker.

587
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,360
Let's see.

588
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,640
Cockroach.

589
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,480
You.

590
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,080
Mint, you're Stinky.

591
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,080
And thank you, Avelion.

592
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,240
Thanks, Avelion.

593
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,070
Oh, are you OK?

594
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,170
I was headbanging and my headphones came off.

595
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,350
Oh, my gosh.

596
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,770
How does it feel playing this game?

597
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,650
Didn't you say you always wanted to play this game?

598
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:25,870
I did.

599
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,290
I did.

600
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,730
I didn't realize we started.

601
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,210
Oh, fuck.

602
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,170
I didn't realize we started.

603
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,350
Yeah.

604
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:33,550
Nice.

605
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,630
Nice.

606
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,310
Oh, you might have to move your don't know on the screen.

607
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,150
The super chat.

608
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,030
Why?

609
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,210
Because it's covering some of the...

610
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:42,910
What are you talking about?

611
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,250
Never mind.

612
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,290
Yours is so big.

613
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,530
It takes up the whole screen.

614
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:48,630
Uh-oh.

615
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,430
It's almost midnight.

616
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,350
It's almost midnight.

617
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,490
Yoink.

618
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,070
Oh, can I run?

619
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,490
I forget.

620
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,510
I don't remember.

621
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,730
Oh, the audio is muted?

622
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,090
Oh, I'm so sorry, guys.

623
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,110
Oh, my bad.

624
00:26:59,430 --> 00:26:59,850
There you go.

625
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,710
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

626
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,090
It should not be muted now.

627
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,540
Yes.

628
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,640
Alright, so I already know that I just have to run every time I hear anything.

629
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,740
One stinky.

630
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,020
Mint, you're stinky.

631
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,180
But there's like some...

632
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:22,440
There's like sometimes it won't let you proceed until you do the thing that it wants you to do.

633
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,060
Repeating a sequence of numbers in a loud voice.

634
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:36,940
Mint, you're stinky.

635
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,060
No!

636
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,440
Oh, my god.

637
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,040
This is creepy.

638
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:41,680
Yeah.

639
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,280
See, it's not even scary right now.

640
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,560
See, you're fine.

641
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,320
I'm fine.

642
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,720
How often do you play horror games?

643
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,120
Never.

644
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,060
Amanda, I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving.

645
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,600
Thank you.

646
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,460
Also, Mint, you're stinky.

647
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,740
I never... When's the last horror game I played?

648
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,520
I played Stalker and it was so scary I had to keep leaving the game.

649
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,540
No way.

650
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:03,920
Yeah.

651
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm afraid that if I scream, I might get scared and fart.

652
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,660
Do it now.

653
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,640
It's your birthday, Amanda!

654
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,500
Pussy.

655
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,280
Sing happy birthday, but Metal Gear... Yeah, I can sing it like that.

656
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,540
Happy birthday.

657
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,660
Congratulations.

658
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,760
Happy birthday with salutations.

659
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,940
Happy birthday.

660
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,820
May your sky stay blue.

661
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,660
Happy birthday to you.

662
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,960
Spooky.

663
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,360
Sometimes you have to zoom in on things.

664
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,560
I think it's left.

665
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,260
Click the left.

666
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,600
I think it's L3 to zoom.

667
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,380
No, click that.

668
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,260
Oh.

669
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,040
Is it?

670
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,960
Can you... Yeah, yeah, see?

671
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,180
It zooms in a little bit.

672
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:02,900
Yeah.

673
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,520
Old hag plays video games for the youth.

674
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,400
It literally is like watching a grandma pick up a controller.

675
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,120
Yeah, this is the actual PS4 version.

676
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,860
I still have it on my PS4.

677
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,320
Thank you.

678
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,420
How much did you buy it for, or did you just never delete it?

679
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,420
You were one of the lucky ones.

680
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,160
I was one of the lucky ones, baby.

681
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,780
Sorry, one second.

682
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,800
My breast is itchy.

683
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,000
Oh my god.

684
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,820
Oh my god.

685
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,040
Oh my god.

686
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,660
Oh my god.

687
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,260
Okay, one second.

688
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,900
Let me go back just to make sure I didn't...

689
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,140
You missed Anthony's stinky.

690
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,560
Mint stinky!

691
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,020
Mattar is definitely stinkier.

692
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:54,060
I, yesterday, or this morning, no, yesterday, she was like, Mattar, do you have soap?

693
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,700
And I was like, damn, she hates me.

694
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,100
She hates me.

695
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,820
I was like, she is calling me out.

696
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,380
She's like, do you need soap?

697
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,200
Do you need shampoo?

698
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,460
I was like, fuck.

699
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,780
Yeah, well, I mean, you know.

700
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,020
No, I appreciate it.

701
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,760
And yes, I do have soap.

702
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,700
Can you not just...

703
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,060
Sorry, nothing.

704
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,920
It was the...

705
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,860
You scared me more than anything else.

706
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,070
Oh my god.

707
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,110
Yeah, sometimes...

708
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:37,790
What's that sound?

709
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,450
Stop, you're scaring me.

710
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,170
No.

711
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,210
This is just a...

712
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,840
Shit, that was so loud.

713
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,940
Oh my god.

714
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,420
Okay, I have a feeling...

715
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,600
Here, let's switch spots.

716
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,000
This mic is way more sensitive than this other mic.

717
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,400
Let's switch spots.

718
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,940
I worry this might not pull as far.

719
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,580
Oh, the controller.

720
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,380
Oh, I think she's following you.

721
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,020
I think we might die.

722
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,000
She's following me?

723
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah, so basically, the ghost lady follows you around.

724
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,600
How long do I have?

725
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,160
I don't know.

726
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,940
Maybe we're fine.

727
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,300
So when does she kill you eventually?

728
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,140
There's like... eventually.

729
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,280
I don't remember.

730
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,080
Do you ever see her follow you behind or no?

731
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:40,900
You can.

732
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,500
Yeah, you can turn around and see her.

733
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,320
What's on here?

734
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,560
Oh.

735
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,680
Uh oh.

736
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,620
Mint, I'm terrified.

737
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,140
Mint, like, I am terrified.

738
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,600
Mint, I don't want to play this game anymore.

739
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,000
I don't know when she...

740
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,400
I don't know when she shows up, I'll be honest.

741
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,660
Okay, so there's certain things we gotta find to open the door, right?

742
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,080
Yeah.

743
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,740
I can't remember.

744
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,080
Hold on.

745
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,820
I'm gonna get a walkthrough up for us.

746
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,160
Hold on.

747
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,640
Oh, the bathroom just opened.

748
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,060
Oh my god, we're gonna see the meat baby!

749
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,020
Oh, the ugly baby, good memories.

750
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,020
Oh wait, there's something here that's gonna, like, shut the door.

751
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,280
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

752
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,500
Wait, I'm actually getting kind of scared.

753
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,120
How do I open the door?

754
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,800
How do I open the door?

755
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,240
Uh, I don't know.

756
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,700
Hold on.

757
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,720
P, T, walkthrough.

758
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,940
Thanks, Kojumbo, for...

759
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,200
You're a little confused.

760
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,380
Try, um...

761
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,080
Try, okay, try pressing in.

762
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,060
Like, press the analog stick.

763
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,700
And zoom in on the hand, like...

764
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,460
Zoom in...

765
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,200
You have to look, you have to zoom in inside the door.

766
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,340
So go to the door, and zoom in.

767
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:58,400
Zoom.

768
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,500
Zoom.

769
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,860
Zoom, no, don't, move forward, zoom!

770
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,060
Analog?

771
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,820
Okay, which one is it?

772
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,480
Yeah, you have to press.

773
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,600
Oh, it's not working.

774
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,220
Huh.

775
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,120
Oh my god, I feel like she's about to grab me.

776
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,280
Now that you've scared me.

777
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,060
Hold on, I'm watching a walkthrough, or reading a walkthrough.

778
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,560
Oh, oh, oh, I zoomed in, wait.

779
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,480
And now what?

780
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,420
Oh, is it R3?

781
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,100
Oh, I thought it was...

782
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,880
Yeah, it's the other button.

783
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,760
Oh, okay.

784
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,820
That's you.

785
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,040
Oh, my headphones.

786
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,340
Zoom in on the baby.

787
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,780
This is crazy.

788
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,700
Okay, keep going.

789
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,930
Your neighbors are gonna think there's a murder.

790
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,480
Keep going, keep walking.

791
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,840
Keep walking, keep walking.

792
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,560
Is she behind me?

793
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,360
I don't know!

794
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,540
Oh wait, she might be there.

795
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,280
Oh, there she is.

796
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,060
What does that mean?

797
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,120
I don't remember.

798
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:12,580
Hold on.

799
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,800
I think you have to walk towards her.

800
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,280
But don't scream, please.

801
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,960
Hold on, I'll lower your mic.

802
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,900
I'll lower your mic a little.

803
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,500
Oh no, she's gone.

804
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,420
Just keep going.

805
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,340
Now do you see why I don't play scary games?

806
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,200
You're scaring me, I don't know.

807
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,080
Oh, look up.

808
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,940
No, no, you tried to kill her.

809
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,080
No, it was back there.

810
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,340
I think she stands on the balcony, you know.

811
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,580
Why are you going back towards her?

812
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,640
You said look back!

813
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,680
No, no, no.

814
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,100
Someone in chat said look up.

815
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,240
Time to go meet the meat, baby!

816
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,800
Oh, there's a flashlight.

817
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,900
Zoom in on the light.

818
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,560
And pick it up.

819
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:08,900
Where is it?

820
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,700
There you go, zoom in.

821
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,520
God, this is like watching Grandma.

822
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,880
And my mouth is open.

823
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,600
I know, you're like...

824
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,420
Oh, okay, okay.

825
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,680
Okay, nice.

826
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,660
Got the meat, baby.

827
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,380
Now we get to see...

828
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,340
I know something scary is going to happen.

829
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,820
No, we're going to see the meat, baby.

830
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,020
And he's going to talk to us.

831
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,680
It's just the meat, baby.

832
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,020
Don't remember this violin.

833
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,520
I can't get out of here yet.

834
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,040
God, what a scary game.

835
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,640
Oh yeah, you have to look into the mirror.

836
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,760
There you go.

837
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,420
It opened.

838
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,040
Oh, it's opening?

839
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,560
That's me.

840
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,560
That's you, actually.

841
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,280
Hold on.

842
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,500
Sorry, I'm being quiet, y'all.

843
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,540
This is like genuinely kind of scary.

844
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,320
Oh, it opened.

845
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:17,740
Oh, it opened.

846
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,580
I see, I see, I see.

847
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,380
You can leave.

848
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,060
Oh no.

849
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:21,880
Eventually.

850
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,200
Yeah, it is really scary, isn't it?

851
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,360
I love PT.

852
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,520
I'm so glad.

853
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,320
I'm almost so glad this game didn't come out because I don't think I would have been able to finish it.

854
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,100
It'd be so scary.

855
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,940
Outlast Trials Collab.

856
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,380
Outlast Trials is just kind of...

857
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,660
Are you okay?

858
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,420
Yeah.

859
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,360
She's like...

860
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,680
She's sunk into her chair, you guys.

861
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,740
Yeah, I don't think we should...

862
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,720
Oh yeah, we are getting OD.

863
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,160
Oh gosh, I'm not ready.

864
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:53,780
What's OD?

865
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,800
It's gonna be Kojima's new game.

866
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,780
New horror game.

867
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:57,660
Oh no.

868
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,660
I know.

869
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,500
Okay, hold on.

870
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,340
Is that her by us?

871
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,200
Is that her coming up on our...

872
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,420
If she comes up behind me.

873
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,100
Okay, so yeah.

874
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,200
Now, I think this is when she starts...

875
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,280
Yeah.

876
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,640
Don't touch that dial.

877
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,680
Okay, it's not working.

878
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,180
Okay.

879
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,520
Oh man, she's gonna be behind us.

880
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Damn, we died so fast.

881
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,000
What happened?

882
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,340
Oh my god.

883
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,680
Thanks for the stream, everybody.

884
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,740
I had a really fun time.

885
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,200
Oh my god.

886
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,860
What the hell?

887
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,880
How did she kill you so fast?

888
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,460
Don't touch that dial now.

889
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,100
You play for like a second.

890
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,480
Here, just put the controller down, take a rest.

891
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,200
So we restart from like the start start.

892
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,700
Yeah, I think so.

893
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,380
How did she get me so fast?

894
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,120
I did nothing.

895
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,320
I don't know.

896
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,680
Thanks for the raid, by the way.

897
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,360
Thank you for the raid.

898
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,880
How did she kill us so fast?

899
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,940
Is it because we kept walking?

900
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,140
Oh, he says don't look behind you.

901
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,980
And I think that's when exactly you looked behind.

902
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,540
Oh wait, maybe it says it'll trigger a new loop.

903
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,580
It does?

904
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,740
Give me like a second and then we'll go into it again.

905
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,340
I'm genuinely like...

906
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,600
You could tell I'm being quiet.

907
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,660
Like I just sank back into my chair and I'm like I just gotta go with it.

908
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,860
She literally was like shrimping in the chair.

909
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
Just like...

910
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,740
Oh, God.

911
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,020
The raiders are now deaf.

912
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,580
Again, raiders, just a reminder, Black Friday special for $20.

913
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,980
No, what do you mean reminder?

914
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,200
For $20, I will call Mint Stinky.

915
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,120
It's all the power I can get.

916
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,580
It makes me feel dominant.

917
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:03,780
Dominant.

918
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,320
I'm the one that will be licking Mint.

919
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,100
Dominant.

920
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,100
That was a great joke.

921
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,980
Yeah, thanks.

922
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,640
I'm proud of you.

923
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,140
I know.

924
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,480
The more I'm scared, the less I yap.

925
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:17,880
It's true.

926
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,940
What's that sound in the corner?

927
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,620
You hear that?

928
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,520
She is freaking out.

929
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,080
She's like...

930
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,060
What is that?

931
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,280
She grabbed for my arm.

932
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,150
Oh, my God, that scared me more than you.

933
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,200
Oh, God.

934
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,600
Also, Mint Stinky.

935
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,320
Stinky.

936
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,000
Stinky.

937
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,880
Stupid fucking bag.

938
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,560
Sorry for my language.

939
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,400
I can't believe it scared me.

940
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,920
Are you sure?

941
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,520
Alright, so I'm supposed to listen to him and obey.

942
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,800
A man listens, a slave obeys.

943
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,240
Yeah, I don't think this is a new loop because it's like we're continuing from the darkness.

944
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,540
I don't hear her though.

945
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,800
Okay, so here...

946
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,620
Wait, wait, wait, don't tell me, don't tell me.

947
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:22,780
Okay.

948
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:23,660
Oh,

949
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,800
here she comes, here she comes.

950
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,500
You can hear her footsteps?

951
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,780
I can't, can you?

952
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,060
No.

953
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:44,980
Oh.

954
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,380
Can you?

955
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,420
God.

956
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,220
Oh, God.

957
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,120
It's so scary.

958
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,320
Oh, the door is closed.

959
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,940
I'm not turning back.

960
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,920
No, he's gonna say it again.

961
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,620
I can't do this.

962
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,660
Don't scream at me, please.

963
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,280
She's gonna come get us again.

964
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,700
Here she comes, here she comes.

965
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,760
I'm taking off my headphones because I don't want to hear you scream.

966
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,580
Don't look back.

967
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,840
Don't look back.

968
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,760
Oh, God.

969
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,700
Now is she gonna come get us?

970
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,200
You're gonna get grabbed.

971
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,080
204863.

972
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,620
Oh, my God.

973
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,080
No, no, no, no, no.

974
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,200
No!

975
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,520
Don't do it.

976
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,040
Are you sure?

977
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,560
Because now...

978
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,260
I think you can try if you want.

979
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,800
Now he says to look behind you.

980
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,520
Also, Min's stinky.

981
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,420
Stinky!

982
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,300
She's standing right behind us.

983
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,300
I know.

984
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,040
I can hear her moaning.

985
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,580
I know.

986
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,320
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

987
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,020
Are you ready for another jump scare then?

988
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,020
I think you can walk backwards and she won't get us, right?

989
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Okay, so here...

990
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,200
Oh, my God.

991
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,320
Shut up, Lisa.

992
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,440
Go away, Lisa.

993
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,880
Go away, Lisa.

994
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,880
Go away, Lisa.

995
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,560
Go away.

996
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,900
Okay, look...

997
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,720
Zoom in.

998
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,420
Right click on the bat.

999
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,060
It's gonna do a thing.

1000
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,100
Or it should.

1001
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,280
Oh, I see.

1002
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,600
You're supposed to do the puzzle.

1003
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,360
Yeah, yeah.

1004
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,460
Lisa!

1005
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:37,840
That's you.

1006
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,720
That's not...

1007
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,720
Oh, maybe it doesn't work.

1008
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,560
Um, Lisa?

1009
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,800
Go away.

1010
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:43,580
Oh, wait.

1011
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,220
Oh, it's chocolate.

1012
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,520
Someone said press X.

1013
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,080
There you go.

1014
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:53,920
Onwards.

1015
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,540
Easy.

1016
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,560
Easy puzzle.

1017
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,620
Tearing me apart when I'm with you.

1018
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,880
When you're apart.

1019
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:03,560
Baby.

1020
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,560
Oh, baby again.

1021
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,520
Baby.

1022
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:09,860
Onward.

1023
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,600
Boob.

1024
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,520
That was...

1025
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,020
Something stinks here.

1026
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,840
Mint does...

1027
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,900
Can I tell them the secret?

1028
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:16,960
So...

1029
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,160
What?

1030
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:17,520
No, okay.

1031
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:17,860
Hold on.

1032
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,920
Tell me first before you tell them.

1033
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,040
I don't...

1034
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,800
I think it's fine.

1035
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,080
Because it's embarrassing for me.

1036
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,520
What?

1037
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,980
In another dream of mine, maybe I watched you play this.

1038
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:28,600
Uh-huh.

1039
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,080
Oh, my God.

1040
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,720
Oh, my God.

1041
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,720
I can hear them calling to me from...

1042
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,680
Oh, I hear her.

1043
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,660
The other side?

1044
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,420
I hear her right behind us.

1045
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,920
I don't know how to like...

1046
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,280
Oh, there she is.

1047
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,180
Oh, my God.

1048
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:47,600
No, no, no.

1049
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,000
I didn't have my sound on.

1050
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,140
I know.

1051
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,120
So, I couldn't...

1052
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,040
I couldn't...

1053
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,520
So, you have no idea.

1054
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:55,000
But I still kept getting scared.

1055
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,280
I still kept getting scared.

1056
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,240
Because of the jump scares.

1057
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,460
Turn that way.

1058
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,560
Just keep going.

1059
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,300
Leave her alone.

1060
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,180
Let her go.

1061
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,700
So, I just don't look behind is basically my whole thing.

1062
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,580
I think so.

1063
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,640
I'm killing it.

1064
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,800
Easy baby game.

1065
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:13,740
Right.

1066
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,680
People are saying look up.

1067
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:16,620
What?

1068
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,260
Oh, my God.

1069
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:17,960
What's wrong?

1070
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,020
The lamp.

1071
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,680
Here is where you look up, you guys.

1072
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:21,940
Right?

1073
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:22,980
It's this part.

1074
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:23,720
Uh-oh.

1075
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,080
So, I don't...

1076
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,620
Nasty.

1077
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,580
I look up, right?

1078
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,560
Yeah, you can look up.

1079
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,240
Yeah.

1080
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,080
Is that a fridge?

1081
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:31,720
What is that?

1082
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:40,720
Nasty.

1083
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,000
When this game came out...

1084
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,660
There is something up there.

1085
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,060
Look up.

1086
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:43,320
Up here?

1087
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,120
Oh, no.

1088
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:44,820
There, right there.

1089
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,100
From...

1090
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:46,540
Wait.

1091
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,840
Forgive me, Lisa.

1092
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,300
There is a monster inside me.

1093
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,560
Go away, Lisa.

1094
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,720
Go away, Lisa.

1095
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:53,980
Oh, fuck.

1096
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,500
I'm gonna lift myself up a little bit.

1097
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:56,780
Okay.

1098
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,570
Sorry, I'm being so quiet, everybody.

1099
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,570
I am, like, actually terrified.

1100
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:12,090
That's...

1101
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:12,870
That's literally you.

1102
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,350
That's your inner thoughts right now.

1103
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:14,750
Yeah.

1104
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,730
I'm more afraid...

1105
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:19,290
Am I going to the bathroom?

1106
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:20,890
I don't remember.

1107
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:21,290
Hold on.

1108
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:21,770
Hold on.

1109
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,670
Let me just go to see.

1110
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:24,790
Little baby.

1111
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,410
Little ugly baby.

1112
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:30,310
Do I just keep going to, like, the same door over and over and over again?

1113
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:32,170
Like, what's the prerogative?

1114
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:33,450
There is...

1115
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:34,550
Okay, hold on.

1116
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,410
Move under the fridge, down the stairs.

1117
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,950
Because it's gotta say, hell.

1118
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,930
Or, hello, or whatever.

1119
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,470
By the phone.

1120
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,530
I'll come back and see if I can look at the phone.

1121
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:47,870
Yeah.

1122
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:49,450
The one right there.

1123
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:50,730
On the right.

1124
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,310
I like how everybody knows the game by heart.

1125
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,990
Everyone's like, oh, you gotta go to the phone.

1126
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:56,330
You gotta...

1127
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:56,910
No, it doesn't...

1128
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:57,250
Oh, wait.

1129
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,510
Yeah, it doesn't say it.

1130
00:45:58,930 --> 00:45:59,530
By the phone?

1131
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:00,170
Oh, wait.

1132
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:00,710
Right...

1133
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,550
Right there.

1134
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:03,450
See the hello?

1135
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:04,050
Yeah.

1136
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,430
I think you zoom in on it.

1137
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:07,410
Okay.

1138
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:08,470
Just to make sure.

1139
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,950
Alright, now go back...

1140
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:10,690
Go to...

1141
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:11,310
Continue onward.

1142
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:12,870
That's a lot of pills.

1143
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:14,730
Yeah.

1144
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,390
Did I zoom in right?

1145
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,150
Or no?

1146
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:20,830
I mean, we'll see.

1147
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:21,590
Hold on, hold on.

1148
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,210
You're moving...

1149
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:22,890
There, see?

1150
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:23,450
There's an L.

1151
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:24,050
Huh.

1152
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:24,690
L?

1153
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:25,230
Bozo?

1154
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:25,690
Yeah.

1155
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:28,910
Thanks for laughing.

1156
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,010
It wasn't that funny.

1157
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:32,230
Alright.

1158
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:33,910
L Bozo.

1159
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:35,230
Get fridged.

1160
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,330
Get jelloed.

1161
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:37,350
I don't know.

1162
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:38,310
Okay.

1163
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,090
That wasn't another L.

1164
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:41,390
Hold on now.

1165
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,310
Okay, now go look at the hello.

1166
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,890
Keep looking at the hello, I think.

1167
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:50,990
What's wrong?

1168
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:51,830
What?

1169
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:52,610
What?

1170
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,450
Oh god, why'd you look back?

1171
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:56,690
Why'd you look back?

1172
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:00,900
Okay, keep...

1173
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,880
I think you can keep going.

1174
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,440
I think you just keep looking at the hello until you take all the words, right?

1175
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,400
Where are you going?

1176
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:08,560
What?

1177
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,280
You said to keep looking at the hello.

1178
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,040
Yeah, and go.

1179
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,980
Like you look at it and then walk.

1180
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,180
Oh, I think that's what we didn't do last time.

1181
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,800
Because it was like the most repetitive puzzle.

1182
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,760
Oh my god.

1183
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,020
Whoa, chill out baby.

1184
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:21,860
Oh wait, no?

1185
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,840
Oh, look away then look back.

1186
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,260
Okay, we gotta...

1187
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,200
Look away and look back, don't look...

1188
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,400
Okay.

1189
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,420
L is for look behind you, Matara.

1190
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:35,840
Suck it.

1191
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,480
Suck it.

1192
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,260
It.

1193
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,520
You suck it.

1194
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,140
Suck it.

1195
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,820
L like in mint stinky.

1196
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,740
Alright, so I look away and then I look back.

1197
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,660
Why do you look that way?

1198
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,000
Why do you look that way?

1199
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,040
Okay, now look at it.

1200
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:56,820
Oh, see?

1201
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:57,880
Now look away.

1202
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,880
Now look back.

1203
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,740
Now look away.

1204
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,480
Now look back.

1205
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,120
Okay, now you can go.

1206
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,360
Low, that's it.

1207
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,680
Now look at that.

1208
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:16,980
Oh!

1209
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:21,800
What?

1210
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,220
Oh, it's the lamp.

1211
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,020
I should've let you pay for dinner.

1212
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,720
Since we're doing this game.

1213
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,380
I tried.

1214
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,680
She did.

1215
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,880
I don't wanna let this break.

1216
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,540
She also ordered her baby tamago sushi.

1217
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,620
I did order baby tamago sushi.

1218
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,520
I can

1219
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:02,100
hear them calling me from hell.

1220
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,780
Actually, we did never truly complete this though, because I think you need a mic for...

1221
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,280
Oh, yeah.

1222
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,200
Oh, fuck.

1223
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:11,920
I'm drunk.

1224
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:12,840
Yeah.

1225
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:13,580
Now we're running.

1226
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,420
We're running?

1227
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:16,840
Yeah, it's like a maze.

1228
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:18,800
Oh, mint?

1229
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,460
Yeah.

1230
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,440
Which way am I running?

1231
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,260
I don't know.

1232
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,960
Just keep going forward.

1233
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,800
Keep on going.

1234
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:33,590
Yeah, we have to look for a hole in the wall.

1235
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,030
I think it will be pretty...

1236
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,110
No, that's a toilet.

1237
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,210
That's a hole in the floor.

1238
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,070
Here?

1239
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,030
No, that's an eyeball.

1240
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,350
Mint, I'm about to get eaten.

1241
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:49,350
No, no, no.

1242
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,990
This is just part of it.

1243
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,590
Just keep on going, keep on going.

1244
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:57,190
That wasn't it, that wasn't it.

1245
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:57,830
No, that's a door.

1246
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,130
Sonic's number one.

1247
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:00,910
Sonic's on the run.

1248
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,430
Watch out for Sonic X.

1249
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:05,490
Sonic X.

1250
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,050
We should have done a karaoke.

1251
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,190
You have to look up.

1252
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,070
Oh, do you want to do karaoke instead?

1253
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,430
Yeah, we should have.

1254
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:13,870
We should have done a karaoke, Mint.

1255
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,370
Instead of this.

1256
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,070
Honey, why are you calling me?

1257
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,210
Whenever you want to tap out, we can do karaoke.

1258
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:24,610
That's a hole, too.

1259
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:25,790
That's a door as well.

1260
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:38,530
You do have to look for the hole, though.

1261
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,450
I can't be running and looking for the hole.

1262
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:43,510
Is that over there?

1263
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,890
Oh, fuck.

1264
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:45,830
I don't know.

1265
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:46,790
Ok, just keep going.

1266
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,050
Maybe not.

1267
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:53,530
Someone said look for the picture frame lying on the ground.

1268
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:54,730
I need healing.

1269
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:56,930
Ok, don't look so far down, though.

1270
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:57,770
Keep going.

1271
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:59,390
Keep going.

1272
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:01,590
Keep going.

1273
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,370
Keep going.

1274
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:05,350
I need healing.

1275
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,350
Going to the bathroom?

1276
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:11,930
Oh my god.

1277
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,550
Going to the bathroom?

1278
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,550
Go over there.

1279
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:22,390
Ok, now zoom in into the hole.

1280
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,830
You have to actually peep.

1281
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,810
You have to be like a real peeping tom.

1282
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,350
Ladies, are we showering?

1283
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:34,770
Don't lean in.

1284
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,710
Don't actually lean in.

1285
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,390
You're going to scare yourself.

1286
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,070
It's because I can't see from far, right?

1287
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:44,690
Oh, we're looking on the wrong side.

1288
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,290
Sorry guys, I really don't remember so much about this at all.

1289
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:49,930
Ok, so...

1290
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:50,110
Go?

1291
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:53,910
We're looking...

1292
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,150
I don't know.

1293
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:00,130
Is that her?

1294
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:01,510
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1295
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:02,310
Mint, don't say that.

1296
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,790
I don't know if she's here or not.

1297
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,360
She'll always be behind you, though.

1298
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,420
She's always technically...

1299
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,140
No...

1300
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,930
They're saying that she's not in this area.

1301
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:27,570
God, it's really making me motion sick, though.

1302
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:37,950
They make it obvious.

1303
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,770
I think you had to still look at that, though.

1304
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,390
So that something triggers.

1305
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:43,910
Something triggers.

1306
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,590
The baby's speaking.

1307
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,710
Oh, we passed it.

1308
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:59,210
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1309
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:00,030
Something just popped.

1310
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:01,510
No, no, no.

1311
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:02,730
You have to keep going.

1312
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:03,550
Are you sure?

1313
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:03,890
Yep.

1314
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:04,770
I saw.

1315
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:05,390
Look, look, look.

1316
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,270
Painting on the ground, leaning on the wall.

1317
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:07,550
Ok.

1318
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:10,050
So, leave?

1319
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:11,970
I know.

1320
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:13,970
Here, let me see it.

1321
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:14,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1322
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,010
Oh, let me look away for a second, because that is...

1323
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,710
Painting on the ground.

1324
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:25,250
Leaning against the wall.

1325
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,990
I think I passed it.

1326
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:32,410
The way she walks there is like waddling around.

1327
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:35,930
Waddling around.

1328
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:39,910
I think our brightness is so dark, I literally can't see anything.

1329
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:41,450
And I made it, like, not as dark.

1330
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:41,990
I know.

1331
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,450
I can't... I don't know how everybody is seeing it.

1332
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,020
It's too dark.

1333
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,420
I can't see shit.

1334
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,280
I found it.

1335
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,380
Oh, wow.

1336
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,420
How did you find that?

1337
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,900
Because I'm a genius.

1338
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,720
Oh, fuck.

1339
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,040
Wait, is that it?

1340
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:09,980
No, keep going.

1341
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,740
It's not letting me peep anymore.

1342
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,660
Oh, yeah, nevermind.

1343
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,080
There's gonna be...

1344
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800
There should be a message that, like...

1345
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,600
Appears after you peep through.

1346
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:27,640
Oh, my God.

1347
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,780
I don't use this controller.

1348
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:44,200
I have to just keep holding.

1349
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,840
You know, I don't think you have to...

1350
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,480
I don't think you have to look around.

1351
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,180
You can just hold down and listen.

1352
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:54,740
Taking all the fine upstanding folk got their welfare cut, got their jobs pulled from under them.

1353
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,980
No, no, no, keep looking.

1354
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,900
Does it restart every time?

1355
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,740
I don't know, we'll find out.

1356
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:02,700
Oh, God.

1357
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,140
Yeah, okay.

1358
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,180
We're listening to Lisa's final moments.

1359
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,040
Oh, boy, we're about to get to the picture part.

1360
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,380
Yeah, you know what to do.

1361
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,260
Now's the time.

1362
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:22,660
No!

1363
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,440
It's his old text message.

1364
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,820
Oh, we have to listen to the whole thing over and over again.

1365
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,080
We have to stop, please.

1366
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,080
Okay.

1367
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:41,500
Okay.

1368
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:41,920
Okay.

1369
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,020
Okay,

1370
00:55:58,370 --> 00:55:59,690
no turning back now.

1371
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:00,970
Okay, I do not turn back.

1372
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:02,050
Run to the exit.

1373
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,930
Why am I walking so slow?

1374
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:06,730
That's how you were walking before.

1375
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,530
So if I turn back now, she'll be behind me?

1376
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,430
I have no idea, just go.

1377
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,730
Yeah, yeah, I'm not turning back, don't worry.

1378
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:14,070
Just stop.

1379
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,930
Just for, just go.

1380
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:17,930
Okay.

1381
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:20,770
I'm not turning back.

1382
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:22,930
Sorry, everybody, I am terrified.

1383
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:23,690
There it is.

1384
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,780
That's why I'm just like...

1385
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:28,050
That really did give me motion sickness, oh my God.

1386
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:28,150
I know.

1387
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:29,730
Made me feel really...

1388
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:37,010
Everything's fine, baby.

1389
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:39,510
It just takes some time.

1390
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:40,730
Oh, gosh.

1391
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:42,050
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

1392
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,930
Oh, it's so dark, it's so dark.

1393
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,050
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1394
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:01,150
Okay, it's not, it's not midnight.

1395
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:02,050
Oh, it's midnight.

1396
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,150
That's good.

1397
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:04,830
Nice.

1398
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,650
Okay, and it's nice and bright.

1399
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:09,450
My favorite.

1400
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:11,550
Meet baby.

1401
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:14,070
Oh, too late, I didn't look at him.

1402
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:15,110
That's fine.

1403
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:19,590
I can hear her calling me from hell.

1404
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,330
What just happened?

1405
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:25,670
Something glitched when I looked up.

1406
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:26,330
Yeah, I know.

1407
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:27,570
Oh, no.

1408
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:38,470
Yeah, see it glitching?

1409
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:38,830
Yeah.

1410
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:40,590
Oh, no.

1411
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:43,610
Oh, no.

1412
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:45,930
Oh, no.

1413
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:51,150
I don't know how often it's supposed to glitch.

1414
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,310
Oh, it's the number.

1415
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:56,090
Yeah.

1416
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:57,810
Do I go back to the phone?

1417
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,910
No, I don't think we search for the photos.

1418
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:05,530
Just after, a little bit's gonna happen.

1419
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:07,950
I like how you're just moonwalking.

1420
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,270
Oh, don't ever turn around, she'll get you.

1421
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:17,320
What are you doing?

1422
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,120
The phone.

1423
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:18,720
No.

1424
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,980
What do you mean no?

1425
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,360
The numbers.

1426
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,040
I'll be heading there now.

1427
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,960
You're laughing because you know everything.

1428
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,620
I did this before, I paid my dues.

1429
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:39,980
I died.

1430
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,180
The only me is me.

1431
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,760
Are you sure the only you is a you?

1432
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,620
How did I die?

1433
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,300
No, that wasn't... I don't think that's technically dying.

1434
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,820
Oh, oh, I'm crawling in my skin.

1435
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:05,860
These wounds they will not heal.

1436
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,080
Is the little bag still there?

1437
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:07,980
I'm gonna go check.

1438
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:08,440
Yeah.

1439
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:09,780
Oh.

1440
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:13,670
Hey there.

1441
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,350
He's like, I'm not talking to you.

1442
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:18,430
Loser.

1443
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,690
Is that technique... I'm sorry guys, I've been... Oh, there we go.

1444
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:24,630
All right, now I'm gonna help you out here.

1445
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:26,370
Look down there.

1446
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:30,510
And... Oh, is it not yet?

1447
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:32,510
Do we have... Oh wait, there we go.

1448
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:33,250
Okay.

1449
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:35,850
Now go back.

1450
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:37,470
Go back.

1451
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:39,150
Okay, now we got one picture.

1452
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:39,810
Okay.

1453
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:40,190
One picture?

1454
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:41,230
All right, hold on.

1455
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:43,910
Hold on.

1456
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:47,270
Can't on the clock.

1457
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:49,050
Clock.

1458
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:50,830
Maybe moonwalk?

1459
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:52,810
Moonwalk?

1460
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:53,350
Moonwalk?

1461
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:59,910
I wanna really try and beat this though.

1462
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:01,070
Oh, oh.

1463
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:04,010
Okay, go, go, go.

1464
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:06,090
Just go, go, go.

1465
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:06,850
Do not stop.

1466
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,550
Do not, do not, just go.

1467
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,810
Just go to the next loop.

1468
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:12,890
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

1469
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,210
Go to the next loop!

1470
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,250
Go to the next loop!

1471
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:17,310
Go to the next loop!

1472
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:17,970
Go to the next loop!

1473
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:24,670
Okay, now...

1474
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:30,110
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

1475
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,090
Go down there, look down at the teddy bear.

1476
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:33,630
And, no, no, no, keep going, keep going.

1477
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,730
She might grab us, so, you know, it's not just looking down.

1478
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:38,810
Or, like, looking behind anymore.

1479
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:39,550
Where is it?

1480
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:42,870
Oh god.

1481
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:44,630
I don't want her to grab us.

1482
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,650
Yeah, she's, like, always here.

1483
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,570
Yeah, I hate it.

1484
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:50,990
Makes me want to throw up.

1485
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:52,930
I wonder how people figured it out the first time.

1486
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,490
Like, the teddy bear and stuff like that.

1487
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,470
It's by the standing soda can.

1488
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:58,010
Okay.

1489
01:00:58,550 --> 01:00:59,910
By the standing soda...

1490
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:00,550
Oh, I see.

1491
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:01,710
Okay, no, no, no, keep going, keep going.

1492
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:04,670
Alright, go, it's, like, there.

1493
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:06,070
Now zoom.

1494
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:07,870
There it is, there it is.

1495
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:08,490
Nice.

1496
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:09,510
Alright.

1497
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,030
Yeah, I would have never figured this out.

1498
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,790
Beneath the window near the phone.

1499
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:15,010
Okay, just keep going, keep going.

1500
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:20,350
I know, right?

1501
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:22,790
This is, like, so...

1502
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:25,730
Oh, wait, sorry.

1503
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,470
Lodging the ceiling beam between the foyer and the bathroom.

1504
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:29,830
Okay, so we'll just keep going.

1505
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,610
Ceiling beam between the foyer and the bathroom?

1506
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:32,050
Yeah.

1507
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,610
I wonder if I... I don't think I have a mic.

1508
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,890
Uh, up, look up, look up, look up, up, up.

1509
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:38,310
Oh, no, no, you were... nope.

1510
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:39,370
Where?

1511
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:41,890
Uh, through and around here.

1512
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,030
Nope, uh...

1513
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:47,610
Look on this side.

1514
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,800
Am I looking in the...

1515
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:00,310
Maybe back a little.

1516
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:01,730
Ceiling.

1517
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,590
You can do it without a mic.

1518
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:07,530
You can.

1519
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,570
You have to turn around to see it.

1520
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:14,690
We'll start again, we'll start again, we'll start again.

1521
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:16,310
Go, go, go!

1522
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:20,910
Oh my god, I am like, I'm about to get grabbed, I just know it, I'm so scared.

1523
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,190
I think you did... no, I didn't do it before.

1524
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:26,970
I didn't have the mic.

1525
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,430
We never actually did it.

1526
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:30,050
Uh, keep going, just keep going.

1527
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:30,350
Keep going?

1528
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:31,350
That means she's like right there, right?

1529
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just keep going.

1530
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:33,450
Just keep going.

1531
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:45,190
Oh, it's red now.

1532
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:47,330
Does that also mean she's haunting?

1533
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:48,430
I have no idea.

1534
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,930
Alright, I'm just going to keep walking until she grabs me.

1535
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:54,890
I don't want her to grab.

1536
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:57,110
It's so dark.

1537
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:58,150
Why is it so dark?

1538
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:06,450
Okay, okay, okay.

1539
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:08,190
She's like right there.

1540
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,470
But I still hear her.

1541
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,030
I know, me too.

1542
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,150
Oh, oh no.

1543
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:17,250
Oh no, you're scaring me.

1544
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:19,410
I'm scared.

1545
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:24,170
Somebody said you can check the photo progress.

1546
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:27,090
Oh my god, that scared me.

1547
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:28,190
How was that?

1548
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:30,310
Bitch.

1549
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:31,150
No.

1550
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:32,750
Thanks, Ava.

1551
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:34,530
That scared me.

1552
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:37,910
Alright, where was the painting thingy to go?

1553
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:39,650
I'm looking up there, right?

1554
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,210
On those little beams up there?

1555
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:43,190
Yeah, but you're going to have to look...

1556
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:45,430
You're going to have to turn around and look.

1557
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:47,750
No, but why would I have to turn around if I'm over there?

1558
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:51,750
No, because it's behind... it's like on the beam on the other side.

1559
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:53,630
Not there.

1560
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:54,270
No, no, no, no.

1561
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,390
A little turn around here.

1562
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:01,450
Scoot back a little.

1563
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:04,010
I'm so scared she's going to get us.

1564
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:07,210
There it is, there it is.

1565
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:09,790
Are you zoomed in?

1566
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:12,250
I think that's it.

1567
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,130
That is it, right?

1568
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:15,750
Hello?

1569
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:17,290
Hello?

1570
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:18,310
Do you want to try doing it?

1571
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:19,370
No, I'm scared.

1572
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:21,050
Hello?

1573
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:23,030
Okay, keep going.

1574
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,030
Alright, the last one...

1575
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:27,950
The last one is in the staircase.

1576
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:31,210
But you have to also...

1577
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:31,890
Oh, nice.

1578
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:32,390
Keep going.

1579
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,370
Get the fuck out of here.

1580
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,030
Fuck all of you.

1581
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:38,350
Not you, Wisp.

1582
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:39,530
Oh wait, there's one more.

1583
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:40,350
There's one more.

1584
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,550
I remember this.

1585
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:42,810
Okay, keep walking a little bit.

1586
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:43,790
Not you, Wisp.

1587
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:44,830
I don't mean like that.

1588
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:46,590
I'm so terrified right now.

1589
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:47,170
I forgot.

1590
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:48,450
Is it this photo?

1591
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:52,940
No?

1592
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:53,800
Okay, never mind.

1593
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,200
Keep going.

1594
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,440
Alright, go to the pause menu real quick.

1595
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:01,620
Which one?

1596
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:02,120
Options?

1597
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:02,720
I think so.

1598
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,420
Are you okay?

1599
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,060
Actually, adjust it a little bit.

1600
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,220
Give me a minute.

1601
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,500
She needs a pause.

1602
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,240
She needs a pause.

1603
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,220
She needs a pause.

1604
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:21,440
Everybody good?

1605
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:22,360
Everybody alright?

1606
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:22,720
No.

1607
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:32,380
I feel good because you've mentally tortured me this whole weekend.

1608
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,280
I am just like disassociating.

1609
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,660
Alright, press R3.

1610
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:50,120
This?

1611
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:53,840
Oh!

1612
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:56,400
Are you kidding me?

1613
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,660
People were never going to find that.

1614
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:00,680
That is the stupidest...

1615
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,440
Okay, I say this with love.

1616
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,300
This is the stupidest game ever.

1617
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:04,980
I'm not even kidding.

1618
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:05,440
I know.

1619
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:06,700
This game is so dumb.

1620
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:07,440
I know.

1621
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,940
How are people going to find that?

1622
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:13,260
Okay.

1623
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,980
Now this is where we...

1624
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:23,360
This is where we...

1625
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,260
Just keep going.

1626
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:29,000
Where it ended for us because...

1627
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,640
Oh, the microphone.

1628
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:30,260
Yeah.

1629
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,480
Now here...

1630
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,740
I don't know what to do here.

1631
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,240
I don't know what to do here.

1632
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:49,430
I have...

1633
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:50,150
Doesn't the...

1634
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:53,350
I thought the controller had a mic on it.

1635
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,450
Hello, can you hear me?

1636
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:56,830
Hello?

1637
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,440
It says loop until the clock says 12.

1638
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,220
That means 12.

1639
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,560
That's wild!

1640
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:09,800
That's 12.

1641
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,640
Do we go?

1642
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,180
Wait, what do we do?

1643
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:15,440
Wait, don't...

1644
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,000
Go?

1645
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,680
It doesn't say 12 though.

1646
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:25,720
Retry?

1647
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:30,310
Hold on.

1648
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:31,410
I'm looking.

1649
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:32,030
I don't...

1650
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:32,810
Mine doesn't say...

1651
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:33,790
Oh, wait.

1652
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:37,070
Everything must be attempted after the clock strikes midnight.

1653
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:41,760
Hold on.

1654
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,360
Let's wait for the bell.

1655
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,760
In order for the phone to ring...

1656
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,000
Is that her or is that you?

1657
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:49,620
It's me.

1658
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,080
Oh, okay.

1659
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:54,020
Oh, just stand by the clock.

1660
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:54,340
Okay.

1661
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,140
Dang it!

1662
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:57,800
We had it.

1663
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:00,420
That timing was so funny.

1664
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:01,400
And then...

1665
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:01,840
Hold on.

1666
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:13,060
Okay.

1667
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,280
This is scary because there's a part where you can't move.

1668
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,800
And I know you will.

1669
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:24,410
Huh.

1670
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:28,870
Mito isn't playing but she's just distressed.

1671
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:29,890
I know I am.

1672
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:32,690
Yeah, she's stressing me out.

1673
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:34,470
Okay.

1674
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:35,830
So, it's...

1675
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:37,030
Okay, this is what...

1676
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,530
The...

1677
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:41,110
Okay, I'm gonna say what the walkthrough I'm reading says, you guys.

1678
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:42,610
And you tell me yes or no.

1679
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:44,210
So, it says...

1680
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:46,690
It must be attempted after the clock strikes midnight.

1681
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:51,570
The player should have a microphone or headset plugged into their controller.

1682
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:53,610
Which I don't have.

1683
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:55,750
In order...

1684
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:57,790
In order for the phone to ring...

1685
01:08:57,790 --> 01:08:58,570
Okay, so this is where I stay still.

1686
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:59,130
No, no, no.

1687
01:08:59,170 --> 01:08:59,490
Hold on.

1688
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:03,210
In order for the phone to ring, you must hear a baby laugh three times.

1689
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:04,650
Walk ten paces...

1690
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:06,270
Okay, now walk ten steps...

1691
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:09,170
Ten steps exactly and freeze.

1692
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:12,650
Right now or after the clock?

1693
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:12,890
Yeah, so go.

1694
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:15,970
One...

1695
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:17,350
Three...

1696
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:18,310
Four...

1697
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:19,010
Five...

1698
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:19,790
Six...

1699
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:20,490
Seven...

1700
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:21,230
Eight...

1701
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:22,190
Nine...

1702
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:22,910
Ten...

1703
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,130
We didn't get a laugh.

1704
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:32,510
Keep going.

1705
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:33,470
Keep going?

1706
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:33,770
Yeah.

1707
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:37,770
Wait until the laugh.

1708
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:44,980
I didn't hear any baby laugh.

1709
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,380
And now?

1710
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,400
Oh, you have to do it while the bell is ringing?

1711
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,000
What?

1712
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,360
No, no, don't give one guide.

1713
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:57,600
I don't think so.

1714
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,600
No, it said everything has to happen after...

1715
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,560
I think she's right behind us.

1716
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,700
So, do we just do the loop?

1717
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,500
You need to hear the steps.

1718
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:11,880
Yeah.

1719
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,180
Is she gonna get us?

1720
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,060
I think she's right behind us.

1721
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:20,760
Isn't she?

1722
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,580
Teleports behind you.

1723
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:23,620
Teleports behind you?

1724
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:24,680
Nothing personal, kid.

1725
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,740
Oh, my mom's house.

1726
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:33,160
I told you, I told you, I forgot Momo at your mom's house.

1727
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:36,300
I lost Momo at her mom's house.

1728
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,400
My mom just texted me and said, look what I found in my bathroom and it's a Momo.

1729
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,560
I knew it.

1730
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,080
Okay, let's wait for the 12.

1731
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,220
And then you're gonna have to listen for the footsteps.

1732
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,100
So, it's not just one, two, three.

1733
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,640
It's like one footstep.

1734
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:56,020
Okay, so I start walking now?

1735
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,200
Yeah, I think you can.

1736
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:06,200
So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, stop.

1737
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:06,900
Okay.

1738
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,340
I keep grabbing Mint.

1739
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:10,620
I know.

1740
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:13,840
We have to hear the baby laugh three times.

1741
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:14,380
It was one?

1742
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,100
So now, do we... don't move?

1743
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:18,400
Okay.

1744
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,280
Remain... it's... okay, the vibrations... the controller might start vibrating, but don't touch anything.

1745
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,120
I think we need a second... no, I think we have to get a second one, right?

1746
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,260
Lisa, I love you.

1747
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:35,960
Lisa!

1748
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,140
Please, Lisa, forgive me.

1749
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,340
I am not your husband.

1750
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,140
Lisa, I love you.

1751
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,460
I love you.

1752
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,900
I'm so sorry for what happened to you.

1753
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,260
Lisa, please release me from this nightmare.

1754
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:56,180
Release me from my dirty cage.

1755
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:02,460
Please, please.

1756
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,300
Someone said they completed this without a mic, so I feel like...

1757
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,320
What if you're getting one guide?

1758
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:11,760
No, I've seen several people say that they did this without a mic, unless they had a mic and they didn't realize, you know?

1759
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:12,360
Alright.

1760
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,280
What do you propose we do?

1761
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,840
Yeah, guys, what do we do now?

1762
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,260
I'm scared.

1763
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:18,880
I'm gonna walk.

1764
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,600
I think we...

1765
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:25,560
This is where we got stuck before.

1766
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:25,980
Yeah.

1767
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,960
You really want us to help?

1768
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:31,380
Yes.

1769
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:32,520
What do you mean?

1770
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:37,340
Alright.

1771
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,140
Back in the club.

1772
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,140
In the club.

1773
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:42,300
We're all fam.

1774
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:46,680
Oh my gosh.

1775
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:52,750
What do we do after...

1776
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,730
Oh, say Jareth into the microphone.

1777
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:55,610
Not Jared.

1778
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:56,650
Like Jareth.

1779
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:58,390
But we don't have the...

1780
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:59,150
Let me look at it.

1781
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,270
It has a speaker-looking thing, but...

1782
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:05,170
I don't think that's a mic.

1783
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:06,990
Let's whisper Jareth when the time comes.

1784
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:07,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1785
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:08,030
Let's do that.

1786
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:09,690
Jareth.

1787
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:10,570
Jareth.

1788
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:11,130
Jareth.

1789
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:20,690
It's a speaker, not a mic, right?

1790
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:21,490
That's what I thought.

1791
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:24,530
Oh my gosh, she's here again.

1792
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:26,590
It is a speaker.

1793
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:30,190
No, the PS5 one is definitely a speaker, but...

1794
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:32,670
Alright, alright, alright.

1795
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:33,210
10 steps.

1796
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:42,230
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1797
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:46,190
Jareth.

1798
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:47,070
Jareth.

1799
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:50,250
Jareth.

1800
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:51,110
Jareth.

1801
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:53,570
Jareth.

1802
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:54,190
Jareth.

1803
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:54,430
Jareth.

1804
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,430
I'm like talking into it.

1805
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:56,450
I'm trying to think of...

1806
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:57,790
If I have a mic, I could use...

1807
01:13:57,790 --> 01:13:58,070
Jareth.

1808
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:58,970
I have to plug into it.

1809
01:13:58,990 --> 01:13:59,170
Jareth.

1810
01:13:59,270 --> 01:13:59,770
Jareth.

1811
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:00,610
Jareth.

1812
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:01,250
Jareth.

1813
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:02,910
It's not Jareth.

1814
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:04,890
Wait, what was that?

1815
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:06,870
Oh, nevermind.

1816
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:07,430
Jareth.

1817
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:08,150
Jareth.

1818
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:08,870
Jareth.

1819
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:10,630
Also, Minstinky.

1820
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:11,410
Jareth.

1821
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:12,150
Jareth.

1822
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:12,930
Jareth.

1823
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:13,670
It's Jareth.

1824
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:15,130
Jareth.

1825
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,250
Wait, say Lisa.

1826
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:17,890
Just say Lisa.

1827
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:18,590
Lisa.

1828
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:19,310
Lisa.

1829
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:20,490
Lisa.

1830
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:21,890
Lisa.

1831
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:22,270
Lisa.

1832
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:22,610
Lisa.

1833
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:23,530
No, I don't think it worked.

1834
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:23,870
Hold on.

1835
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:25,150
This is so silly.

1836
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:27,130
Hold on, I'm gonna...

1837
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,910
Okay, just stand there.

1838
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:31,210
I'm gonna go try and see if I can find a mic.

1839
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:32,430
You don't want me to move at all?

1840
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:34,230
You can't leave me.

1841
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:37,450
You can't leave me.

1842
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:38,430
I'm scared.

1843
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:40,590
I'm trying to think of a mic right now.

1844
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:42,230
What if I reloop and we talk to the phone?

1845
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:45,290
I got one man for that.

1846
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:47,530
Wait, oh, you have a guy for a phone?

1847
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:48,290
No, no, no.

1848
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:49,770
Some guy said to talk to the phone.

1849
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:50,230
Oh.

1850
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:52,490
Phone, phone, phone, phone.

1851
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:54,010
Phone, phone, phone, phone.

1852
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:56,870
Okay, so, what's the plan?

1853
01:14:56,990 --> 01:14:57,910
PS5 controller.

1854
01:14:58,250 --> 01:14:59,350
But this is a PS4.

1855
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:00,850
Loser.

1856
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:02,970
You think you're made of money?

1857
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:06,550
What kind of mic would be good?

1858
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:11,610
Oh, mint, it's green.

1859
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:13,330
Why is it green?

1860
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:14,910
Oh my god, what does it mean?

1861
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:15,870
Why is it green?

1862
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:17,470
Momos and wisps, what does it mean?

1863
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:19,190
It means you're good to go.

1864
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:19,710
I don't know.

1865
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:21,750
iPod headphones?

1866
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:24,390
I don't have an iPod.

1867
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:28,270
Uh...

1868
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:29,930
I don't get how Gary gets out too.

1869
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:31,290
That scared me.

1870
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:31,730
What?

1871
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:33,330
It was like a Gary sound effect.

1872
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:34,850
What do you mean, what does that mean?

1873
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:38,810
I don't know, there was like a sound effect that somebody played, I think.

1874
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:40,770
Oh, oh!

1875
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:44,390
It wasn't Akidono.

1876
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:47,250
Wait, wait, this is the for sure solution.

1877
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:51,690
Walk ten steps, say a J name into the mic, but we don't have one.

1878
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:55,510
Then finally stay still, any mic works even if you have the Playstation camera.

1879
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:57,610
You can test mic and PS settings.

1880
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,550
A USB mic?

1881
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:05,890
I don't have a USB mic.

1882
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,770
A Gary sound effect.

1883
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:13,670
Alright, I need your help with the headphones.

1884
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:14,330
Why?

1885
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:15,130
Ten steps.

1886
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:16,490
Oh, okay.

1887
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:17,750
One...

1888
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:18,990
Two...

1889
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:19,470
Three...

1890
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:20,090
Five...

1891
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:20,730
Six...

1892
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:21,330
Seven...

1893
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:22,010
Eight...

1894
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:22,610
Nine...

1895
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:23,170
Ten...

1896
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:23,870
Okay.

1897
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:27,090
Jared!

1898
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:28,370
Jared!

1899
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:29,670
Jason!

1900
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:30,810
Wait, this one says...

1901
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:31,450
Stop...

1902
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:32,470
Wait...

1903
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:35,250
Ten steps forwards and stop, baby laughs, don't move again.

1904
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:39,410
After the clock stops ringing, continue to wait until the Lisa music fades.

1905
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:41,450
Is that true though?

1906
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:43,890
That's what we've been doing and nothing happened.

1907
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:46,390
Oh, it's speeding up.

1908
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:48,070
What?

1909
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:51,350
Do I have earbuds with a mic?

1910
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:52,770
Yes, I do have those.

1911
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:53,750
Let me go grab them.

1912
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:00,880
I'm scared.

1913
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,780
I'm scared.

1914
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,260
She left me.

1915
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:10,820
Wisp, she left me.

1916
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,700
Wisp, she left me.

1917
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,380
She left me.

1918
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:32,090
I'm sorry I'm being quiet for once.

1919
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:33,150
I'm just so scared.

1920
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:38,810
I am my main phantom and I am a stinky little girl.

1921
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:40,610
I am a stinky, stinky little girl.

1922
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:41,890
Welcome back.

1923
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:45,250
I'm right at where you left me.

1924
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:45,710
Okay.

1925
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:47,170
Why is it so green?

1926
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:49,130
I'm right where you left me.

1927
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:49,910
Now I'm here.

1928
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:50,950
I got...

1929
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:51,250
Okay.

1930
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:52,910
Plug this in to the bottom.

1931
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:55,310
Jared!

1932
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:55,870
No, hold on.

1933
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:56,910
The mic is ringing.

1934
01:17:59,030 --> 01:17:59,450
Jared!

1935
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:00,490
Jared!

1936
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:02,950
Oh, but now I can't hear because of the thingy.

1937
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:04,190
Oh, it switched to this.

1938
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:06,230
Okay, take off the headphones and go to this.

1939
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:08,390
Oh, she's moaning.

1940
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:09,790
Jared.

1941
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,410
Lisa.

1942
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:11,270
Lisa.

1943
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:13,450
Lisa.

1944
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:13,810
Lisa.

1945
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:19,270
Oh, you guys can't hear it now either.

1946
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:19,970
Uh-oh.

1947
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:20,690
It's okay, it's okay.

1948
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,370
She's moaning.

1949
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:23,150
She's just moaning.

1950
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:23,530
She's just moaning.

1951
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:25,190
She's like...

1952
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:27,130
I'll

1953
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:32,120
unplug it once you guys...

1954
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:32,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1955
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:33,140
Once it works, you know?

1956
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:36,700
Should we move when she's done moaning?

1957
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,040
Maybe.

1958
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:39,720
Oh!

1959
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:40,960
We got a second baby!

1960
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:41,720
We got a second...

1961
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,380
Don't move, don't move, don't move.

1962
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,260
We got a second baby.

1963
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,240
We got a second baby.

1964
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:45,840
We got another baby.

1965
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:46,540
We got another baby.

1966
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,760
Okay, what do we do after the second baby laugh?

1967
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:49,860
Do we just wait for baby...

1968
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:51,220
Oh, it's vibrating.

1969
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:52,540
Oh, let it vibrate.

1970
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:53,200
Let it vibrate.

1971
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:53,920
Let it vibrate.

1972
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:54,820
Oh my god, I'm gonna feel.

1973
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,100
Oh, don't touch it, don't touch it, don't touch it.

1974
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:01,520
Remain mochiceless until the vibrations cease entirely and the third laugh will trigger.

1975
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,640
And then the phone will begin to ring.

1976
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:04,800
Oh!

1977
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,380
We got another laugh!

1978
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:07,560
We got another laugh!

1979
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,240
We got a...

1980
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:08,940
Oh, the phone's ringing!

1981
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:09,520
The phone's ringing!

1982
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:09,820
Do I pick it up?

1983
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:11,600
Hold on, hold on.

1984
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:14,280
The phone is ringing, guys.

1985
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:14,780
What do we do?

1986
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:15,320
What do we do?

1987
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:16,440
We can unplug the mic now.

1988
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:16,800
Okay.

1989
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,080
Do we...

1990
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:18,980
Do we go get the phone?

1991
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,240
Go get the phone?

1992
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:23,760
Zoom in on the phone.

1993
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:24,280
So, turn around.

1994
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,460
Go to the phone, go to the phone.

1995
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,000
Turn around, turn around.

1996
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,500
Oh my god, we're finally doing it!

1997
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:31,420
Zoom in, zoom in.

1998
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,240
Yeah!

1999
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,100
Oh my gosh!

2000
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,280
Now what?

2001
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:40,660
Finish the loop.

2002
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:41,700
Go, go!

2003
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:43,520
Oh my god, I can't believe it!

2004
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,900
I finally did it!

2005
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:45,580
And you too!

2006
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:46,800
We finally did it!

2007
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,820
We did it!

2008
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,200
I can now proudly say...

2009
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:49,740
Wait, the front door!

2010
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:50,700
So, hold on, hold on.

2011
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:51,840
Wait, is it the front door?

2012
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:52,640
Front door, front door.

2013
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,460
Front door, front door.

2014
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,980
You little shitheads.

2015
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,080
Wait, front door?

2016
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:06,480
Keep going?

2017
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,380
Try it again?

2018
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:08,400
Do a zoom on it?

2019
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,100
Oh, it's a loop door.

2020
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:11,460
Okay.

2021
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:13,600
Holy, you guys.

2022
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,220
So, we're doing fine.

2023
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:15,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2024
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:17,080
Just, okay, nevermind.

2025
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,120
Oh my gosh, you guys.

2026
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:20,740
Well, it's a good thing we tried anyway.

2027
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,360
Oh my god!

2028
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,220
Oh my god!

2029
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,900
We have officially finished the game!

2030
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:30,640
High five!

2031
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,020
Sorry I was so quiet.

2032
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:33,200
I was legit terrified.

2033
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,740
Wait, I can't wait to watch this.

2034
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:35,380
Oh my...

2035
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:36,150
Such a drag!

2036
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,260
Oh my god!

2037
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,580
Oh my god, I can't believe it!

2038
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:43,060
I'm so glad this mic worked!

2039
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,020
I'm so happy!

2040
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:10,090
Oh my god, I'm turning it up.

2041
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:16,110
It's so cool seeing this on my own monitor and it's from my own PlayStation.

2042
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:17,550
Oh my god!

2043
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:22,010
Oh my god.

2044
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:26,290
Oh my god, it's so awesome.

2045
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:29,650
Oh my god.

2046
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:34,830
Oh my god.

2047
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:37,230
Oh, it's really nostalgic actually seeing this.

2048
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:37,730
Oh my god!

2049
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,290
Seeing this after so long is so nostalgic.

2050
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:46,890
I don't think I've watched it since it first was announced or first figured out.

2051
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:50,690
My heart.

2052
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:52,670
Oh, my heart.

2053
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:54,130
Would've been so good.

2054
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:58,150
Yeah, that was Norman Reedus like way back when.

2055
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:00,310
Yeah, this is Norman Reedus.

2056
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:04,130
Norman Reedus and his initial funky fetus.

2057
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:08,270
This project also had Junji Ito on it.

2058
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:08,770
Really?

2059
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:09,510
Yeah.

2060
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:16,210
Oh my gosh, it's so weird seeing this.

2061
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:21,950
Oh my god.

2062
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:25,830
This whole game was just the trailer for Silent Hill.

2063
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:26,990
Hills!

2064
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:28,090
Hills, sorry.

2065
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:29,850
Because it's a playable trailer, right?

2066
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:30,430
Yeah.

2067
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:31,710
Oh gosh.

2068
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:32,770
And nobody could beat it.

2069
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:34,430
How were you even going to beat this trailer?

2070
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:35,930
Oh, the Silent Hill music.

2071
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:39,610
I get so excited.

2072
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:44,790
This is so sad.

2073
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,090
This is so sad.

2074
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:48,010
I cry.

2075
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:49,510
Good job, Atari!

2076
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:51,530
Thank you for the help.

2077
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:56,490
I like how they're like, look, I know we just did this game and you played it, but it has nothing to do with Silent Hill.

2078
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:56,810
I know.

2079
01:22:57,130 --> 01:22:58,230
Like, we just, you know.

2080
01:22:58,330 --> 01:23:01,250
We just wanted to scare the poopy out of you and that's it.

2081
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:04,510
That was so troll with like the pictures.

2082
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:06,190
It just doesn't make any sense.

2083
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:08,410
You're looping forward just to then see that.

2084
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:09,990
Kajimbo, you really cooked.

2085
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:13,430
He's my coworker now.

2086
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:14,490
I know.

2087
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:20,030
I'm sorry, I need a minute.

2088
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:21,930
I'm like...

2089
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:24,570
I don't do good with scary.

2090
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:26,050
But you're in the game.

2091
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:26,790
Look, you're right there.

2092
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:29,090
I was in the game a lot.

2093
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:29,750
Oh man.

2094
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:32,010
Yeah, you were in the game a ton.

2095
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:33,310
So, thoughts, prayers?

2096
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:35,790
How do you feel?

2097
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:37,810
You finally, you actually beat P.T.

2098
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:40,330
So now, like you never have to do it again.

2099
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:43,950
I can brag about it to people now that I, and I told you that I wanted to do that ages ago.

2100
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:44,430
I know.

2101
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:45,990
So thank you for making my dreams come true.

2102
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:50,130
And on original hardware, like this is, we can just, we teleported, when did this come out?

2103
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:51,590
2008?

2104
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:54,150
No, way later.

2105
01:23:55,590 --> 01:24:02,610
This was, this, a 20, 2014, 2015, 2014, 10 years ago.

2106
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:05,910
We teleported ourselves 10 years in the past.

2107
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:08,430
And now, we beat it.

2108
01:24:09,290 --> 01:24:10,470
No, I'm not the biggest thing.

2109
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:11,630
Screw you, Lisa.

2110
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:12,570
Yeah.

2111
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:14,510
Oh, well, I mean, she did get murdered.

2112
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:15,230
It's not really her fault.

2113
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:17,510
I like how it has nothing to do with the actual Silent Hill.

2114
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:18,610
That's the crazy part.

2115
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:21,250
Like, this game has nothing to do with it.

2116
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:24,210
Not, well, we'll never know if it did or not.

2117
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:26,190
You say that, but maybe we will.

2118
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,590
Unless they, like, reused the...

2119
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:30,090
What if he has, like, a 20 year NDA?

2120
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:35,310
That would be quite, quite wild.

2121
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:37,570
That would be crazy.

2122
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:41,110
I mean, there's a lot of stuff that is the same.

2123
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:42,510
Norman Reedus, The Baby.

2124
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:43,550
Yeah.

2125
01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:44,650
What else?

2126
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:45,510
I'm excited for OD.

2127
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:48,150
The new game?

2128
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:50,230
Stop to play Death Stranding.

2129
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:52,410
No, I have to finish Death Stranding.

2130
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:53,690
Did you like it?

2131
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:54,750
From what I played, yeah.

2132
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:59,990
It's hard, it's, it was harder to stream because there were a lot of restrictions for the songs.

2133
01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:01,490
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2134
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:04,570
And it's also just a very quiet game.

2135
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:05,950
Like, kind of, I wanted...

2136
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:06,510
Yeah.

2137
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:10,350
Part of it, like, I almost was like, I don't want to stream this.

2138
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:12,190
I just kind of want to, like, bask in my...

2139
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:12,750
Enjoy it, yeah.

2140
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:16,090
In my adventure, kind of.

2141
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:17,610
But...

2142
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:21,470
I gotta get ready for Death Stranding 2.

2143
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:25,030
And if Death Stranding 2 has Pecora in it...

2144
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:26,310
That would be crazy.

2145
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:28,630
I wonder how they're gonna have her in there.

2146
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:28,850
Let's see if she...

2147
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:30,150
If it's gonna be just, like, a standee.

2148
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:37,150
No, because, basically, with other actors, you would go to a place to deliver things, and then...

2149
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:41,790
I said if, you guys, I said if Pecora's in it, but, you know.

2150
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:42,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2151
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,350
I want to see if she's in it.

2152
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:56,270
But you go to, like, a location, and a projection will happen, and you'll talk to a person, and it's usually, like, some famous actor.

2153
01:25:56,830 --> 01:26:02,090
So, I think that if they do it like that again, maybe it will be that.

2154
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:06,270
The hologram, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2155
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:07,610
I'm excited.

2156
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:11,370
Yeah, Conan O'Brien was in it, Junji Ito was in it.

2157
01:26:12,190 --> 01:26:13,390
I know they had a ton of monster.

2158
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:15,390
Like monsters?

2159
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:16,490
Energy drink.

2160
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:17,570
Oh, yeah!

2161
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:19,510
Monster energy was in it.

2162
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:21,850
Hold on, let me get more hot water.

2163
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:22,330
Okay.

2164
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:23,030
One moment.

2165
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:24,230
Would you like anything?

2166
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:25,570
No, I'm good, thank you.

2167
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:28,550
Wow.

2168
01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:30,670
No, you're good.

2169
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:32,090
You're good.

2170
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:33,490
You're good.

2171
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:35,870
Recovery.

2172
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:39,570
Wow, that was so good, you guys.

2173
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:41,550
We kind of sped run it.

2174
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:46,290
But I really, since, like, you know, we had watched it before together, I was like...

2175
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:50,470
I think we can speed up, especially for Matoro's sake.

2176
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:55,030
We just speed up the process, but I'm so glad we could actually complete it now.

2177
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:58,110
Everything feels so complete now.

2178
01:26:59,650 --> 01:27:00,090
Yeah.

2179
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:05,330
Thanks for the PT, Macy.

2180
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:05,710
Yeah.

2181
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:07,810
Oh, you scared me.

2182
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:11,030
What other games are you playing this week?

2183
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:12,030
What are your plans this week?

2184
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:13,570
I don't know yet.

2185
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:15,730
Did you bring the twin snakes?

2186
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:16,810
Are those yours or mine?

2187
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:17,310
They're yours.

2188
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:18,310
I already ate all mine.

2189
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:18,630
What?

2190
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:19,690
You're eating my twin snakes!

2191
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:21,950
I already ate mine.

2192
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:23,010
I already ate mine.

2193
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:25,190
Oh my gosh, you guys, we watched the Macy's Day Parade.

2194
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:27,010
Oh, can we talk about that?

2195
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:27,490
That's so funny.

2196
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:30,130
And, so, I don't have television.

2197
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:33,630
I don't have, like, cable or anything like that.

2198
01:27:33,690 --> 01:27:36,930
So, I was just like, oh, we'll just put on, like, a YouTube live stream of it.

2199
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:39,230
And it was...

2200
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:42,430
It was...

2201
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:42,970
So funny.

2202
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:45,430
Oh my god, the camera work was terrible.

2203
01:27:46,050 --> 01:27:46,230
Yeah.

2204
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:47,170
It was so...

2205
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:49,670
At one point, the guy, like, wiped the camera with his sleeve.

2206
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:50,250
Yeah!

2207
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:51,810
There was no commentators.

2208
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:52,810
It was so great.

2209
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:54,270
Like, grayscale, whatever it's called?

2210
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:55,890
Oh, it was so funny.

2211
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:56,710
Did you just mute me?

2212
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:58,270
No, no, sorry, I was, uh...

2213
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:59,290
She's like, you know what, Watari?

2214
01:27:59,310 --> 01:27:59,930
You're done talking.

2215
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:02,050
You're in mic, too, anyway.

2216
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:06,870
They sang Sing on the Sesame Street float.

2217
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:07,350
What?

2218
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:09,230
What?

2219
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:11,090
She kept asking, when's Pikachu coming?

2220
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:12,970
No, I kept asking when Goku's coming.

2221
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:14,810
And then Goku came.

2222
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:18,430
Yeah, it was really desaturated.

2223
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:21,370
It was like, there was no color.

2224
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:23,410
It just looked gloomy and sad.

2225
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:26,550
But there was a Haribo float.

2226
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:28,690
And they had the Twin Snakes on there!

2227
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:36,290
Which means, if they sang Sing on the Sesame Street, and also Twin Snakes, that means there were two Metal Gear references.

2228
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:39,370
In the floats.

2229
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:41,890
That nobody knows but me.

2230
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:43,470
And other Metal Gear fans.

2231
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:45,790
Do you like my Metal Gear display?

2232
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:46,970
I love it.

2233
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:50,110
I was gonna say, you saw a quote at your mom's house.

2234
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:51,470
Oh, yeah!

2235
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:52,690
It was like a Metal Gear quote.

2236
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:54,130
Close to it.

2237
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:55,390
What was it?

2238
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:56,670
You have a picture of it.

2239
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,030
Oh, yeah, yeah!

2240
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:01,810
Basically, my mom... No, it wasn't Metal Gear.

2241
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:02,870
Oh, but it was like Metal Gear.

2242
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:03,610
It was Ace Combat.

2243
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:05,070
Oh, my bad, my bad.

2244
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:05,750
No, it's okay.

2245
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:11,830
My mom had this, like, this quote written on her...

2246
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:13,570
Like, live, laugh, love.

2247
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:14,890
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

2248
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:20,810
And, but instead, on the outside of it was the brackets they use in Ace Combat.

2249
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:24,190
So I was like...

2250
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:25,470
My brain rot.

2251
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:28,670
My brain rot's never going away.

2252
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:32,690
So I took a picture of it.

2253
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:33,830
Yup.

2254
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:35,830
Oh, no!

2255
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:37,670
That was the other thing.

2256
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:41,570
Yes, my mom has a sign too that says, the best is yet to be.

2257
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:44,110
And I took a picture of it.

2258
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:48,470
Did you let Matara touch the Pachi slot?

2259
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:50,530
Yeah, I touched it.

2260
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:52,590
I turned it on.

2261
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:54,070
But she didn't play it.

2262
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:54,650
Do you want to play it?

2263
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:57,890
Um, not really.

2264
01:29:58,110 --> 01:29:59,690
I'm like, kind of, I'm very tired.

2265
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:02,390
Like, I've been very low energy while I've been here.

2266
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:04,150
And I think you guys can even notice.

2267
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:05,870
Like, I'm just, I'm really tired.

2268
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:10,750
Once you kind of, like, take time off and then you realize, like, oh, I'm actually out of it.

2269
01:30:11,890 --> 01:30:13,450
It's kind of disassociating through the day.

2270
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:13,950
She's disassociating.

2271
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:16,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2272
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:18,370
Someone's like, so no karaoke?

2273
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:25,570
Um, we can do, like, one song.

2274
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:26,810
Yeah.

2275
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:29,670
We can also just yap and see what everyone's up to.

2276
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:31,470
How is everyone else's Thanksgiving?

2277
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:33,090
Yeah, what'd you guys eat?

2278
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:38,830
We're, uh...

2279
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:42,050
Stinky!

2280
01:30:42,490 --> 01:30:42,890
Stinky!

2281
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:46,370
Happy Thanksgiving, pumpkin pie.

2282
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:48,250
I love pumpkin pie.

2283
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:49,590
We shared a pumpkin pie.

2284
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:51,030
We did, we did, we did.

2285
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:52,770
I'm Canadian.

2286
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:54,530
It was very, and you accidentally ate from my fork.

2287
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:56,530
I did accidentally eat from my fork.

2288
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:58,410
Yeah, she just, she wanted the indirect kiss.

2289
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:00,710
Oh, no.

2290
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:01,030
Maybe.

2291
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:03,710
No!

2292
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:05,230
No!

2293
01:31:05,470 --> 01:31:06,270
It's like we kissed.

2294
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:12,650
Um, crawfish.

2295
01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:15,430
Mmm, crawfish sounds good.

2296
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:15,890
Are you Southern?

2297
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:21,070
That sounds like a, sure, that sounds like a Forrest Gump thing.

2298
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:22,430
Crawfish.

2299
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:28,150
Yeah.

2300
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:39,190
Now, now all your energy has gotten, you've completed, I see, I feel like completing PT gave me...

2301
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:39,890
More energy.

2302
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:41,590
It almost gave me new life.

2303
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:46,190
I feel like I'm about to be, I feel like I could become a human again.

2304
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:50,210
We gotta, we gotta make sure that doesn't happen.

2305
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:51,450
Why?

2306
01:31:51,490 --> 01:31:52,690
We like you as a ghost.

2307
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:55,650
You'd be too strong as a human.

2308
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:57,730
I think I'm stronger as a ghost.

2309
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:00,990
I get to possess many people.

2310
01:32:01,070 --> 01:32:03,530
Yeah, please unpossess me, leave me alone.

2311
01:32:04,130 --> 01:32:05,170
Leave me alone.

2312
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:09,970
Leave me alone.

2313
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:12,150
I'm gonna make your body do unspeakable things.

2314
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:14,550
No, leave me alone, please, Matt.

2315
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:14,790
Yeah.

2316
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:19,410
Hi, honeys, I'm a tarot card.

2317
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:20,950
Why are you leaning in so much?

2318
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:22,550
What do you mean, leaning in?

2319
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:23,430
I'm like, yeah.

2320
01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:24,510
Oh, you're like this usually?

2321
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:24,930
Uh -huh.

2322
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:26,990
But my, but the camera's down here.

2323
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:30,110
Hi, honeys, I'm a tarot card.

2324
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:32,270
You're so dumb.

2325
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:35,190
You're so stupid.

2326
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:38,090
What are you doing still?

2327
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:43,570
I feel you, I shouldn't let you pay for dinner.

2328
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:44,770
Why did I buy dinner?

2329
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:45,970
I'm eating your twin snakes.

2330
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:47,470
Why did I buy dinner?

2331
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:57,310
I hate this.

2332
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:00,310
I feel...

2333
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:01,130
I hate this.

2334
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:02,890
Hold on, I wanna put my head underneath.

2335
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:05,250
Oh, gosh.

2336
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:10,070
You're so dumb.

2337
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:13,290
Everybody be jealous of me.

2338
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:15,070
Please stop.

2339
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:18,390
Stop possessing me.

2340
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:25,750
The first thing you would do if you possessed anybody, you would just gulp their breasts, wouldn't you?

2341
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:29,070
With love.

2342
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:33,250
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

2343
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:39,370
Your little ahoge is tickling me.

2344
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:41,170
Stop.

2345
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:46,390
Yeah, guys.

2346
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:51,650
I know you wanted to go to bed early.

2347
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:53,570
Do you want me to let you talk to them?

2348
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:56,130
Yeah, I'll talk and then you can go.

2349
01:33:56,550 --> 01:33:58,090
No, wait, I was gonna help you with your laundry.

2350
01:33:58,610 --> 01:34:00,130
It's okay, I'll talk to them tomorrow.

2351
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:01,710
I can sit here and watch you talk with them.

2352
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:02,410
Oh, okay.

2353
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:05,410
I will stare at you while you speak to them.

2354
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:11,790
I don't like the sound of the scraping behind us.

2355
01:34:12,590 --> 01:34:13,230
In the game.

2356
01:34:13,430 --> 01:34:14,650
Oh, you have the headphones off.

2357
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:16,750
Ew.

2358
01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:18,450
Ew.

2359
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:21,350
Oh, my God.

2360
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:28,610
Oh, God.

2361
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:30,230
It's horrible.

2362
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:32,070
It's disgusting.

2363
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:35,330
Okay, I'm gonna end the stream now.

2364
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:36,290
Thank you, guys.

2365
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:37,030
Bye, everybody.

2366
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:37,910
We love you so much.

2367
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:38,390
Bye-bye.

2368
