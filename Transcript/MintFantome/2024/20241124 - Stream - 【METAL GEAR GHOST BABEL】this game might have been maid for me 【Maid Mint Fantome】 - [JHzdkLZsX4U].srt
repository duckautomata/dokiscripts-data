1
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,830
Loyalty to the Khan.

2
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,910
Loyalty to the Khan.

3
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,790
Whoa!

4
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,920
Wait, should I watch this or should I wait?

5
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,340
Um...

6
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,700
I don't know.

7
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,540
Anyway, I'm gonna just press start.

8
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,760
Go away, Campbell.

9
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,080
Welcome back, Master.

10
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,320
Hello, everybody.

11
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,220
Welcome.

12
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,380
Welcome, welcome to Metal Gear.

13
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,700
This is solid, but it's Ghost Babble.

14
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,540
I'm excited to see you play the first MGS game I ever got to play.

15
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,600
I was an N64 kid.

16
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,120
Let's go!

17
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,040
Thanks for the superchat.

18
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,280
Cooper, thanks for the gifted.

19
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,860
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

20
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,940
The title screen lasts for like two seconds.

21
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,240
It's her, the babbling ghost.

22
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,540
It's me!

23
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,640
My voice is a little shot today.

24
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,900
I was up late recording stuff.

25
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,680
So, if I sound a little squeaky, I'm sorry.

26
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,100
Yeah.

27
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,600
Let's just let this run.

28
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,660
I'm not gonna pay attention to it just yet, though.

29
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,760
We'll just let it run while I talk.

30
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,920
Because I have a couple things to say first.

31
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,540
Stop!

32
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,440
It's distracting me!

33
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,100
Okay.

34
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,060
I...

35
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,440
I...

36
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,420
I...

37
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,180
So, I...

38
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,410
Oh.

39
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,090
I was planning on playing...

40
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,310
Stop it!

41
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:30,410
I was planning on playing Ghost Babble anyway, obviously.

42
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,090
I said I was gonna play some of the Metal Gear games that I haven't yet played.

43
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,670
In between me going to 4.

44
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,570
But...

45
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:53,870
I also was just like... I was asked not too long ago about joining a group of streamers for MGS Con.

46
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,590
We called ourselves the Cobra Unit.

47
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,890
But...

48
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:07,170
And I was like, oh, well, if I'm gonna be streaming Ghost Babble anyway, I can at least promote MGS Con a little bit.

49
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,690
So if you don't know MGS Con, this will be their third year.

50
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,630
I went to both years.

51
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:20,790
And for this year, they asked if I wanted to be a host for the convention.

52
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,050
It's only if we meet the stretch goal, which if we don't, that's okay.

53
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,890
But if we do, that's really awesome too.

54
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,290
Mainly, I have the Kickstarter in the pinned.

55
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,730
If you want to donate, if you're just like, yeah, this seems pretty cool, I like Metal Gear.

56
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,230
It's run by some really cool people.

57
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,850
And they're all very passionate about Metal Gear, obviously.

58
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:58,550
And they work really hard to get all the voice actors and people associated with Metal Gear to come into the con.

59
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,610
And apparently they have really big plans for this year.

60
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,330
Or I guess next year.

61
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,710
So if you're just like, this seems cool, maybe you can go.

62
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,670
If not, you could check it out.

63
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:26,350
They have an online digital con as well.

64
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:35,490
Basically, if they don't reach the stretch goal, that's fine.

65
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,070
But if they don't reach the goal at all, the convention won't be able to happen.

66
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,070
So it's kind of like...

67
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:55,650
I think they're all very much having high goals for the next year.

68
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

69
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:08,710
But any superchats sent today, of course, I will send those to the Kickstarter.

70
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,670
And any donos as well.

71
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,650
Or if you want to donate directly to the Kickstarter.

72
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,990
If you're just like, oh, I want to go, I want to support this or whatever.

73
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,850
Yeah.

74
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:25,830
So...

75
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,010
What?

76
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:27,750
What the?

77
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,070
They gave me more time.

78
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,110
Ontario, California, how confusing.

79
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,390
I know, right?

80
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,390
Oh my gosh, it's so confusing.

81
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:43,530
Because if you get a plane ticket, it's going to say Ontario, CA.

82
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,570
That's so confusing.

83
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,970
Who decided this?

84
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,250
I love this game, thank you for playing it.

85
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:51,990
Thank you!

86
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,390
Thanks, Nicholas, for the superchat.

87
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,030
I'm doing my part.

88
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,190
Thanks, AJ.

89
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,930
But yeah, so...

90
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,810
You know, if you...

91
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,070
Like I said, if you like Metal Gear, and you're just like...

92
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,470
You want them to be able to keep doing these conventions.

93
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,650
Thank you!

94
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,430
Sorry, I had to turn the notice down a lot, because it's...

95
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,670
The game is very loud.

96
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,650
What's your emotion for battle then, Minto?

97
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:22,970
Freak.

98
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,850
Yeah, the freak.

99
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,250
Yeah, see, everybody gets it.

100
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:26,830
The freak.

101
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,290
I'm planning on buying the VR pass.

102
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,850
It'll be my first con VR or otherwise.

103
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,490
Let's go!

104
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,270
Yeah, so...

105
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,970
You know, like I said...

106
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,550
You know, obviously, you know...

107
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,570
I was going to play this anyway.

108
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,910
But I was like, I should...

109
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,570
I would like to...

110
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,710
And I'm not like really affiliated with the con.

111
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,370
But like I said, they're really great.

112
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,570
They're really nice people.

113
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,990
They do so much to kind of keep the Metal Gear...

114
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,810
Metal Gear energy alive.

115
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,290
And...

116
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

117
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,170
Time to go Canada.

118
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:10,690
No!

119
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,350
I can't go, but it's really cool that you're going to be a host.

120
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,110
Sorry, I can't do more.

121
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:20,370
What?

122
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,770
No!

123
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,690
That's so...

124
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,830
What are you talking about?

125
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,850
I mean, at all.

126
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,630
It's amazing.

127
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,470
Thank you, Brandon.

128
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,070
Ghost babble?

129
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,070
She sure does.

130
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,790
I hate that I know Ontario, California.

131
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:35,370
Because...

132
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,150
Rasslin?

133
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,570
Is there...

134
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,990
Like a...

135
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,950
A...

136
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,950
A...

137
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,410
Wrestling ring there?

138
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,410
I've heard of Ghost Babble for decades at this point.

139
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,210
First time seeing it.

140
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,030
Let's go Solid Minto.

141
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,730
Yeah!

142
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,070
Yeah, I...

143
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,550
Honestly, I don't know so much about this game.

144
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,570
To be honest.

145
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,150
I know a little bit about the story, but like...

146
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,370
Not a ton.

147
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,470
So I'm very excited to check it out.

148
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,750
For Metal Gear Minto.

149
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:04,990
Thank you!

150
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,110
Hot dog!

151
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:06,630
Thank you!

152
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,910
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

153
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,970
Thank you, Jacob.

154
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,670
Thank you, Verilant.

155
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,390
Thank you, Ronan.

156
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,650
Let's go to Alaska.

157
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,550
Anyway.

158
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,790
I don't want to waste so much time.

159
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,170
Let's enjoy Ghost Babble!

160
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,950
Oh my gosh, Metal Gear!

161
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,090
Thank you!

162
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,350
This game isn't like...

163
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,670
The MSX ones, right?

164
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,270
Like, I should be fine on normal.

165
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:42,450
Right?

166
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,510
Got the digital tear.

167
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,230
Let's go!

168
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,210
Happy to donate to the cause, Minto.

169
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,970
Thank you!

170
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,690
My wife and I are celebrating...

171
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,250
Our 9 year wedding anniversary today.

172
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,790
We started watching your streams together over the summer and became huge fans.

173
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,330
Could you wish my wife, Corrine, a very happy anniversary?

174
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,510
Stay freaky!

175
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,730
Thank you for the pink!

176
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,550
Oh my gosh.

177
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,670
Stay freaky!

178
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,110
Happy...

179
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,030
Happy...

180
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,570
Wedding and 9 year anniversary!

181
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,030
Corrine!

182
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,530
Happy birthday!

183
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,610
Opening intro doesn't play again.

184
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,090
Okay,

185
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,580
we'll let it play again.

186
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,300
We'll wait for that to play and then we'll get into it.

187
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,060
Thanks, Mod.

188
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,920
Oh my god.

189
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,080
Stay on the main menu to watch the intro.

190
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,600
Yeah, yeah.

191
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,720
Thank you!

192
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,620
This is kind of like a third MSX game.

193
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,960
With the modern quality of life enhancements.

194
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,680
So not as difficult.

195
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:47,940
Okay.

196
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,840
We should be fine on normal, though.

197
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,400
Then.

198
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,780
Yesterday, I played Devil May Cry 2.

199
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,100
And I had a bit of a headache.

200
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,000
Towards the middle-ish of it.

201
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,320
And the headache, unfortunately, continued today.

202
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,800
So, I'm like...

203
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,740
I just took some medicine.

204
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,400
Hopefully, it kicks in soon.

205
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,280
Take it easy, boss.

206
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,140
Thank you!

207
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,980
Like I said, my voice is so raspy.

208
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,080
It's so squeaky today because of recording.

209
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
There's been just so much that I've been...

210
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,880
I've been non-stop.

211
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,680
Go, go, go.

212
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,060
Go, go, go.

213
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,100
For like this whole week.

214
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,160
I'm just...

215
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,480
I wanna nappy.

216
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,200
I missed the DMC2 stream.

217
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,540
Was the game really that bad?

218
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,820
I had fun.

219
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,180
I think I just have fun hanging out with you guys.

220
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,580
And like...

221
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,700
Streaming, right?

222
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,040
Are you aiming to beat this game in one sitting too?

223
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,320
I would like to.

224
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,700
Because it's not so, so long.

225
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,320
I think it's about the same as...

226
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,040
DMC2.

227
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,500
Which is why I started at the same exact time.

228
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,900
Yeah.

229
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,700
Yeah, I...

230
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,560
But it's all exciting stuff that...

231
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,580
You know...

232
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,640
I am doing.

233
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,940
So, I can't complain.

234
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
It's just busy, busy.

235
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,600
Was it bad?

236
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,480
I had fun.

237
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,680
But was...

238
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,960
I had fun.

239
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,940
When is it gonna come back?

240
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,480
Hello?

241
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,400
It's so quiet.

242
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,620
For those who don't know, this is a Gameboy game.

243
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,100
So that's kind of fun.

244
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,780
Not so Deadpool!

245
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,400
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

246
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,140
Wait, so is this Ontario, Canada or Cali?

247
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,780
Cali!

248
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,960
Ontario, California.

249
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,860
It will play.

250
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,520
I think it just takes a minute.

251
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
It will play.

252
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,060
Don't worry.

253
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,020
Just takes a minute.

254
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,980
Because it did it earlier.

255
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,860
It was because I think I pressed new game.

256
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,140
And was in that menu and it kind of reset.

257
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,140
But that's okay.

258
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,400
We can just kind of sit and talk.

259
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,940
Let's sit with our thoughts.

260
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,660
I didn't have to think for very long.

261
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,460
Thank goodness.

262
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,020
I closed my eyes and I could see the light.

263
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,680
It was blinding through my eyelids.

264
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,200
It's a chance to catch a stream on my birthday.

265
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,840
I will sing a happy birthday.

266
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,280
Hold on, after this though.

267
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,260
Remind me, okay?

268
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,740
Campbell, it's been a long time, Snake.

269
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,960
Didn't expect to see you again.

270
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,580
Drink?

271
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,760
Got scotch?

272
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,840
Single malt, straight up and neat.

273
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,300
If I remember right.

274
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,420
That you do.

275
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,360
This house?

276
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,720
Build it myself.

277
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,140
Oh my god, he's a handyman.

278
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,920
Didn't know you were a carpenter.

279
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,520
Call me Sabrina.

280
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,420
You know, it's already been three years.

281
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,400
Since you left.

282
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,160
How's Alaska been treating you?

283
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:47,880
Colonel, did you come all the way out here with the cavalry to make small talk with me?

284
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,320
Trouble, huh?

285
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,960
The world is on the brink of nuclear holocaust.

286
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,060
We came to request your help.

287
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,000
Request, as if I have the choice to refuse.

288
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,600
You do.

289
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:18,040
I know you too well that you can't be ordered or coerced.

290
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,360
But you'll say yes.

291
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,020
Because you need to.

292
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,940
Let me tell you about it first.

293
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,340
I can't feel like a robot.

294
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,200
I love all these lasers on Snake.

295
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:42,460
A week ago, a C-5 Galaxy transport plane on a classified mission to South America vanished.

296
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,020
These dramatic pauses too.

297
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,220
Terrorists?

298
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,920
Of course.

299
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,180
But the problem is what it was carrying.

300
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,800
Nuke.

301
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,720
Yes.

302
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,340
And some.

303
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,880
It was Metal Gear.

304
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,480
How's the audio by the way?

305
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,400
Maybe it's a little quiet.

306
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:24,700
A nuclear capable bipedal armored vehicle designed to realize the possibility of nuclear strikes from anywhere on the planetary surface.

307
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:33,860
The devil's candy of mass destruction to change the meaning of nuclear warfare.

308
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,840
And it was on that plane.

309
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,890
But I...

310
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:48,440
Yes, you destroyed Metal Gear in outer heaven seven years ago.

311
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,060
But the U.S.

312
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,300
government recognized the strategic advantages of Metal Gear.

313
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,320
And secretly extracted the data from outer heaven.

314
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,760
The development continued just under a different flag.

315
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,740
The South American hop was probably for a field exercise.

316
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,200
Christ.

317
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,700
Metal Gear's researchers were also on board.

318
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,300
The idea of Metal Gear in terrorist hands.

319
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,600
Goosed Washington into finding out it's new location in just a week.

320
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,580
A common came in today.

321
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,440
Where?

322
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,440
Gindra.

323
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,140
Gindra.

324
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,680
Goosed?

325
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,560
Central Africa.

326
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,140
Fairly small.

327
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,780
I heard there was a civil war going on.

328
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,100
An armed uprising by a separatist ethnic minority.

329
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,320
And that peacekeeping troops were...

330
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,000
Oh wait, and that peacekeeping troops were deployed.

331
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,380
So the hermit keeps up with the news.

332
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,700
That's so rude.

333
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,380
Don't call Snake a hermit.

334
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
Metal Gear is in the hands of the armed separatist group Gindra.

335
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,600
Liberation Front.

336
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,660
Commonly known as GLF.

337
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,740
She's my GLF.

338
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,500
Their leader is General Augustine... I didn't get the last name.

339
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,760
Charismatic and armed to the teeth.

340
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,380
They'll operate out of a virtually impregnable fortress.

341
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,720
Galloway.

342
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,640
In the mountains.

343
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,180
Sorry.

344
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,140
Neither the Gindran government nor the UN can get to them.

345
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:07,700
We also have intel that they recently hired several top class mercenaries as consultants.

346
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:15,700
We suspect that the mercenaries executed the Metal Gear hijacking.

347
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:26,860
So they plan to win their independence by threatening nuclear strikes with Metal Gear.

348
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,700
Not the consultants.

349
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,680
Snake, come with me to Gindra.

350
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,760
We need you.

351
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,880
We need the legend.

352
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,020
Don't call me that.

353
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:49,460
I know all the names for a killer.

354
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,020
And that's one of them.

355
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,360
A military dictatorship in possession of... Metal Gear?

356
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,400
Damn it.

357
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,880
You know they won't hesitate to push... that button.

358
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,080
And millions will die.

359
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,340
Well maybe the US shouldn't have created Metal Gear!

360
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,520
Colonel, I'm not in FOXHOUND anymore.

361
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,540
You're saying you won't go?

362
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Why can't you leave me alone?

363
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,080
Alaska is quiet and my life is good.

364
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,540
You won't change your mind?

365
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,580
No.

366
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:43,720
Even if I tell you that the fortress, Galloway, GLF's home base, was once called...

367
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,060
Outer Heaven?

368
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,200
What?

369
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,640
The very same place where you went to war seven years ago.

370
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,440
Destroyed Metal Gear and became the legend.

371
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,180
Is there a connection?

372
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,280
I don't know.

373
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:15,120
But the fact is, there is Metal Gear in Outer Heaven.

374
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,860
Once again, you believe in coincidence.

375
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,320
I believe in conspiracy.

376
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,900
And you want me to find out.

377
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,100
I'm asking you to join me.

378
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,040
Campbell looks mighty wrinkly here, doesn't he?

379
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,860
If the past is at your heels, you turn around and face it.

380
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,620
Am I wrong?

381
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,270
End it once and for all, if only that were the case.

382
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,910
What did you do for a Scooby snack?

383
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,730
It's all back there, in Outer Heaven.

384
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,590
Tell me about this mission.

385
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,430
Oh my gosh, more.

386
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:07,170
Your mission is to infiltrate the Fortress Galloway.

387
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:17,610
Rescue the hostages and neutralize Metal Gear before its assembly is complete.

388
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,810
I saw ass.

389
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:26,490
Steve Gardner, the National Security Advisor, is in command of this mission.

390
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,010
Gardner himself?

391
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,510
America's best-kept secret just got hijacked.

392
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,210
And may be used in a terrorist attack.

393
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,430
Who else?

394
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,790
A national crisis, in fact.

395
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,170
A global one, I'd say.

396
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,570
And one more thing.

397
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,550
Okay, Columbo.

398
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:57,650
The Army's Delta Force is already in Galloway.

399
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:02,490
Carry out the mission in concert with them.

400
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,630
Whose bright idea was this?

401
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,430
Wait, there's more people there?

402
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,950
John Parker, Army Chief of Staff.

403
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,730
Top Army brass, huh?

404
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,410
Metal Gear's development was under Army control.

405
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:30,490
They, of course, want to do something about the situation themselves.

406
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,210
The dead.

407
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:39,590
In addition, four people will serve as your backup personnel via the Codec.

408
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,690
Oh my god!

409
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,230
Mei Ling!

410
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:45,810
Awfully young.

411
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,910
Doesn't look like a soldier.

412
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,270
PhD candidate at MIT.

413
00:25:53,470 --> 00:26:00,170
Incidentally, she developed the new radar and Codec system you'll be using.

414
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:07,270
She'll be in charge of mission logs saving as well.

415
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,350
It looks like a dog head.

416
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,390
I thought so too!

417
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:21,050
When you have a question about the radar or the Codec or need to log in, save, contact her at frequency 140.96.

418
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:31,030
Brian McBride, Africa Desk Director of Operations, Central Intelligence Agency.

419
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:32,790
CIA.

420
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,830
Don't look so disgusted.

421
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:41,010
McBride effectively planned this mission.

422
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:41,690
Mission.

423
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:47,990
Ed has expert knowledge of Gendron affairs.

424
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:55,750
Ask him about the mission, GLF, or Gendron environment if you need to.

425
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,030
What's his Codec?

426
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,130
Frequency is 141.52.

427
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,070
Ronard Lensenbrick.

428
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,990
Wait, alias is what?

429
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,390
I've heard of him.

430
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,970
Word is he's about as trustworthy as a weasel.

431
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,670
Oh, his code name is a weasel.

432
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,370
Some say as good as Solid Snake, the legend.

433
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,590
So why isn't he working the field on this?

434
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,470
So true.

435
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:37,890
The US government apparently has more trust in you.

436
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,690
Looks like a JoJo's character.

437
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,110
I doubt that.

438
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,670
Anyway, weasel's a player in the mercenary circle.

439
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:53,830
He's well up on soldiers of fortune from all over the world.

440
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:01,030
And we know that GLF contracted some major ones.

441
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:06,270
If you run across a live one, get weasel.

442
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,070
I'm the Codec, sorry.

443
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,270
I'll wake up eventually.

444
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,310
He'll have something useful for you.

445
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,910
I have field control of this mission.

446
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,090
Frequency is 140.85.

447
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:27,170
If anything happens, contact me ASAP so I can stay on top of it.

448
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:34,590
Didn't you retire from FOXHOUND two years ago?

449
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,450
Why this mission?

450
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:43,390
No one can carry this mission out but you.

451
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,970
I was only called in because I know you.

452
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:54,950
I was only called in because I know you.

453
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:00,270
I also have a score to settle with the past.

454
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,330
We all have our shadows, Snake.

455
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:09,550
Talking like this is like I have to reach deep into my throat.

456
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,890
It's making me yawn.

457
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,870
Because it's like opening my throat because I have to talk like this.

458
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,650
You guys like my voice acting?

459
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,510
Snake, we've arrived over Outer Heaven.

460
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,130
Gallowade.

461
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,090
10 out of 10.

462
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,570
Ready to descend.

463
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,670
We're counting on you.

464
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,190
I know.

465
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,330
It's all back here.

466
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:46,430
This is what the timeline would have been like if Snake didn't rip off all his clothes in Briefing Room.

467
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,410
Spread your wings and fly.

468
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,230
I thought of it too.

469
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,050
I thought that too.

470
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,110
Nice!

471
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,350
Welcome to Ghost Battle.

472
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,870
Let's get into it, baby!

473
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,310
New game?

474
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,410
I'm going to do normal.

475
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,390
Oh!

476
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,010
My birthday is tomorrow.

477
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,910
I didn't want to distract from the collab tomorrow.

478
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,670
Sands of time got hands.

479
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,150
Okay, I have two birthdays I have to...

480
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,490
First was Cryocyte.

481
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,110
And then Merc, I'll sing for you too.

482
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,870
Happy birthday to you.

483
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,090
Happy birthday to you.

484
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,890
Happy birthday, Cryocyte.

485
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:36,810
Happy birthday to you.

486
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,870
Happy birthday!

487
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,330
One more time!

488
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,630
Happy birthday to you.

489
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:49,130
Happy birthday to you.

490
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,470
Happy birthday dear Markel.

491
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,270
Happy birthday to you!

492
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:06,050
OK, reach deep in your throat.

493
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,310
Deep throat.

494
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,530
One more time!

495
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,710
Oh my gosh!

496
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,040
Oh my gosh, actually, it doesn't do that horrible... Oh my god, thank god for Mei Ling.

497
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,960
Thank god for Mei Ling, instead of getting the...

498
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,980
We now have proper codec sound.

499
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,740
Earlier I was on stream, I saw Trombone Champ.

500
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,140
It's getting a VR game, it comes out on the 26th.

501
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,920
Oh no, Trombone Champ.

502
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,800
This is Snake.

503
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,220
Colonel, can you hear me?

504
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,580
Successful Halo landing, I see.

505
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,040
It was a Halo jump.

506
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,620
Oh my gosh, Mint is so cute.

507
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,280
Nothing like skydiving at dawn.

508
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,320
Present location, three kilometers south of Fortress as planned.

509
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,640
Heavy security, sentries ahead.

510
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,120
Snake, make sure you stay out of their sight.

511
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,020
Mei Ling!

512
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,060
Oh my gosh!

513
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,180
Watch the radar to keep track of enemy movements.

514
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,280
I'll go over it again, just in case.

515
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,900
It was my birthday yesterday.

516
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,360
One more time.

517
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,640
Happy birthday to you.

518
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,720
Happy birthday to you.

519
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,680
Happy birthday, Lama Radio.

520
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,920
Happy birthday to you.

521
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:07,820
Enemy...

522
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,900
Is that the famous Solid Snake?

523
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,700
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I'm being hit on by the legend.

524
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,920
What was I going to say?

525
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
I don't remember.

526
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,920
Oh, I remember.

527
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,640
I saw some people in pre-chat saying that this game might need a guide.

528
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:39,700
Unfortunately, the game is all on one screen, and then my other screen is vertical, so there's not a lot of space.

529
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:48,060
So, if you guys can help me out a little bit, if you have a guide up or if you know the game...

530
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,900
I might request you guys as my chat codec, okay?

531
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,420
We're chat codec today.

532
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,180
Backseating?

533
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,060
No way!

534
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,620
Permission to backseat, sir!

535
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,260
Permission granted.

536
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,100
Yeah.

537
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,860
Let's see, what is she saying?

538
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,620
Oh, okay.

539
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,280
Sorry, I thought I clicked... I pressed B on accident instead of A, so I thought I skipped the whole thing.

540
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,800
Alex, welcome to membership.

541
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,420
Only if you make the codec sound when calling us.

542
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,120
Which one do you want?

543
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,980
Do you want...

544
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,280
Or do you want...

545
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,140
Ghost babble being played by a ghost babe.

546
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,800
Okay, when I want help, I'll go...

547
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
The second one?

548
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,040
Okay.

549
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,420
See the radar at the top right?

550
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,300
The large dot is you.

551
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,600
The others are enemy troops.

552
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,700
Even Mei Ling suffers from... Oh, do I get to...

553
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,020
Oh, I don't get to move yet.

554
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:53,580
Got it?

555
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,240
Okay.

556
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,820
Once you've been detected by the enemy, the radar will be non-operational.

557
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,520
Be careful.

558
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:05,780
Okay.

559
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,780
Thanks, Mei Ling.

560
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:20,040
Your mission is to infiltrate Gallowade, work with Delta, force to rescue the researchers, and destroy Metal Gear.

561
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,780
Welcome to membership.

562
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,600
Our codec frequency is... No, that's not your codec.

563
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,680
Orders will be relayed via the codec.

564
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,100
My frequency is 140.85.

565
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,540
Wow, the sprites look so good.

566
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,100
Call if anything turns up.

567
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,240
Like, you can tell that snake's soul well.

568
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,900
Do I have any pets in any video games?

569
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,880
In video games?

570
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,940
No, I don't think so.

571
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,780
To use the codec, just press select.

572
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,660
And then start.

573
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,820
We'll be in touch.

574
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:08,080
When a call sounds, push the select button to receive.

575
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:15,160
Raise me on frequency 140.96 when you need to save.

576
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,560
First, get to the front of the fortress.

577
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,120
Oh my gosh, I would love to get there, Campbell, if you would just shut up and let me play the game.

578
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,040
Cut northward through the jungle you're in.

579
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,660
Roger that.

580
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,280
Yay!

581
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,160
Then I press start.

582
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,000
Oh, interesting.

583
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,820
Select shows me...

584
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,220
Oh wait, up, down is item, weapons.

585
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,100
I have nothing.

586
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,060
And then I press start to codec.

587
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,180
Oh, cool!

588
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,940
Where do we want to go, guys?

589
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,540
They said go north, right?

590
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,440
Okay, I'm being sneaky.

591
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,660
I'm being real sneaky.

592
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,540
This needs to be in volume 2.

593
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,240
I agree.

594
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,280
This way.

595
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,650
Alright, I'm being so sneaky.

596
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,890
Oh my god, there's just a guy here.

597
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,850
Wait, maybe I can kill him.

598
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,790
When he turns around.

599
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,350
Does he come down?

600
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:35,730
Ow!

601
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:36,490
Oh gosh.

602
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,910
Don't come over here!

603
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:41,970
Maybe he goes back up.

604
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,430
Maybe he goes back up.

605
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,550
Let's go kill him.

606
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,470
Oh, he's just passed out.

607
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,970
Okay, I grab whatever this is.

608
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,810
I got a handgun!

609
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,830
Let's go!

610
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,470
Um...

611
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,280
Knockout!

612
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,060
Oh, that's a wall.

613
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,180
That was dramatic, wasn't it?

614
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,780
Everything's fine, guys.

615
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,500
Everything is fine.

616
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,020
That guy woke up so fast!

617
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,840
What was I supposed to do with him?

618
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,220
The map is a little misleading.

619
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,540
Because it shows... or rather the codec, right?

620
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,100
Not codec, sorry.

621
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,340
Because it shows... Oh, I can walk through here!

622
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,560
Oh my gosh, never mind.

623
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,540
It's not misleading at all.

624
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:57,980
I'm just dumb.

625
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,460
Is there anything in here?

626
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,250
5-7 ammo.

627
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,050
Pouches are full of ammunition.

628
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:10,790
Oh, okay.

629
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,870
Oh yeah, let me... what is it?

630
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,290
Select weapon.

631
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,250
What do you mean?

632
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,410
Oh, I have no item.

633
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,430
There we go!

634
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,490
5-7 handgun.

635
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,510
Oh wait, a handgun.

636
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,630
B to fire.

637
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,730
Suppressor, okay.

638
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,970
Nice.

639
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:26,810
Alright.

640
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,450
Oh wait, there we go.

641
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,650
Okay, B to fire.

642
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,290
A is our...

643
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,130
A is the pouch.

644
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:38,770
CQC.

645
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,070
Suppressor, okay.

646
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:42,970
This guy's not coming in here, right?

647
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,650
Leave, please.

648
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,870
Thank you.

649
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,510
Oh my gosh.

650
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,770
I just noticed the guy up there.

651
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:06,350
Okay, I think we're safe.

652
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,070
Nice.

653
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:08,610
Did it!

654
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,570
I'm sleepy.

655
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,090
Cool.

656
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,490
Big field.

657
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,350
I'm just gonna keep going on the sides.

658
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,510
Can I walk in this?

659
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,230
Oh, it's grass.

660
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,610
I feel asleep.

661
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:37,490
I see people on the radar, but I don't see people.

662
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,450
You can crawl in the grass.

663
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,330
How do I crawl?

664
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,090
How do I crawl?

665
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,830
I'm gonna catch Pokemon in here.

666
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,130
Start?

667
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,390
Oh my god.

668
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,690
That's so great.

669
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,790
Can I get in the mud too?

670
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,150
Oh gosh, I have oxygen in here.

671
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,920
Good thing this guy's vision sucks.

672
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:15,840
Go to sleep.

673
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,720
Sleepy.

674
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,880
He's so sleepy.

675
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,200
What's this?

676
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:28,720
Rations?

677
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:35,560
All the sound effects are so Metal Gear Solid.

678
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,860
Feast and flee.

679
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:46,840
Flee?

680
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,320
What does that mean?

681
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,160
Does this pause?

682
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,200
It looks like it does.

683
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:57,680
Item.

684
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,440
Now we have fogger.

685
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:00,940
Wait, what?

686
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,660
A device that emits smoke.

687
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,480
Fogger.

688
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,400
What?

689
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,380
How do I use it?

690
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,780
How do I use this thing?

691
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,480
Okay, weird.

692
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,940
Oh, it's emitting smoke, I think.

693
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,190
Cigarette?

694
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,430
It's not hurting my health then.

695
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,230
PDUs, keep one handy.

696
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,340
Oh no!

697
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:37,980
No!

698
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,820
Oh my gosh, don't see me.

699
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,920
How do I get across here?

700
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,000
I think I might have to kill a person.

701
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,940
Can you go under the bridge?

702
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,620
Oh my gosh, there we go.

703
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,160
Dummies.

704
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,900
Okay, onward!

705
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,180
Nintendo didn't allow smoking.

706
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,820
Keep the rating lower.

707
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,020
I didn't kill anybody!

708
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:20,480
What?

709
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:21,880
How did I kill...

710
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,600
Wait, terrible!

711
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,360
They don't even sugarcoat it.

712
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,300
Oh my gosh, they're just like...

713
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,420
Imagine being a little kid.

714
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,080
You're like 7 years old playing.

715
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,360
You're like 7 years old playing this game.

716
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:55,160
And they tell you you're terrible.

717
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,020
That's messed up.

718
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,200
They're like, the kids can handle it.

719
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,220
Metal Gear Solid, not really.

720
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,540
Punch out twice equals kill.

721
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,680
I see, I see.

722
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,740
Snake, we have new intelligence.

723
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,780
I wish I had new intelligence.

724
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,240
Bad news.

725
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,700
Wow, a Draco's!

726
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,540
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

727
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,680
How did you know?

728
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,640
You've never exactly been a messenger of joy.

729
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,480
Rip.

730
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,880
So...

731
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,920
Seems that Delta Force was wiped out.

732
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,660
What?

733
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,890
I was actually looking forward to...

734
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,940
Here, I'm going to... Hold on, I'm going to zoom in a little bit.

735
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,980
I hope that's okay, you guys.

736
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,340
I was looking forward to working with that.

737
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,980
I was like, wow, you actually get to fight with some other guys.

738
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:02,800
That's so exciting.

739
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,700
Are you serious?

740
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,960
Musicbox, thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

741
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,220
It's true.

742
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:19,140
But Delta Force, the best of army's best.

743
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,560
Ghost Bible, yeah!

744
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,020
So easily?

745
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,420
It means they were outclassed.

746
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,940
That's how weasel sounds now.

747
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:42,400
Those mercenaries on the enemy's payroll are all A-list guns.

748
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,100
You've been out of action for a while.

749
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:53,600
But I'm out there and I know what I'm talking about.

750
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:02,220
If you're going to take one of them on, give me a buzz.

751
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:08,960
A buzz, a buzz, a buzz, a buzz, a buzz.

752
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,000
Planning to give me advice?

753
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,260
That's what I was hired for.

754
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,180
It's a policy of mine to earn my keep.

755
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,620
Why aren't you here?

756
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,840
Frequency is 141.80.

757
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,820
Don't forget it.

758
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,180
Jason Funderburker?

759
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,020
I won't.

760
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,780
Snake McBride from the CIA here.

761
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,540
This guy looks like Ken Doll for real.

762
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,980
Don't underestimate GILF.

763
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,100
They are just another rebel group there.

764
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,360
Annual revenue from drug and rare metal.

765
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,880
Trafficking is more than 50.

766
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,660
I thought it was just going to be 50 dollars.

767
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,840
50 dollar million.

768
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:11,760
And their black market arms were financed by that money.

769
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,400
My hair is getting in my headphones.

770
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,000
All state of the art.

771
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,020
Be careful.

772
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,540
I'm with the Africa Desk of Ops.

773
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,060
I can provide data on not just the GILF.

774
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,960
But on things like the GILF.

775
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:49,160
Like kindred climate, flora and fauna.

776
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:54,860
My frequency is 141.52.

777
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,280
Snake, continue with the mission.

778
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,800
Infiltrate the fortress Gallowade.

779
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,280
That's it.

780
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,160
More?

781
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,620
Snake, first gain entry to the fortress.

782
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:22,020
Enemy security should be even tighter than your mom.

783
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,320
Sorry.

784
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,820
Than it was in the jungle.

785
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,420
Keep your eyes open.

786
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,900
Especially for surveillance cameras.

787
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,120
A surveillance camera.

788
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,780
Is there anything over here?

789
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:41,940
Nothing.

790
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,540
What if I punch this wall?

791
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,340
Looks like a secret.

792
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,600
A surveillance camera.

793
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,780
What is the range on the surveillance camera?

794
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,560
Not good.

795
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,080
Okay, we're going in bottom.

796
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,120
What is the range on these guys, I wonder.

797
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,280
Okay, not very good.

798
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,900
Kind of awesome.

799
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,280
A door!

800
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,040
Oh no!

801
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,880
There are people who use the door.

802
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,940
Wait, maybe I can make it in.

803
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,540
I'm infiltrating?

804
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,540
He just left the door wide open.

805
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,440
What's over here?

806
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,660
That guy is gone.

807
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,820
Another door.

808
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,800
Can I go through this door?

809
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,150
It's time for a shift change.

810
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,150
Is it all ready?

811
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,390
Come on, hurry up.

812
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:10,290
We're both in big trouble if they catch us slacking off.

813
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:13,030
Relax.

814
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:17,390
As if anyone ever comes out here.

815
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:20,570
Can I move?

816
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:21,510
I can't move.

817
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,350
Now I can move.

818
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:22,790
Oh my god.

819
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:24,550
Oh, okay.

820
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:25,370
It's scripted.

821
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,210
Oh my goodness, I was so scared.

822
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:32,830
Suppressor!

823
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,070
Can I... Can I get in these lockers?

824
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:40,850
Maybe not.

825
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:41,190
Okay.

826
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,010
Nice!

827
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:45,830
Suppressor, baby.

828
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,970
Might be being reckless, but...

829
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:53,110
Nice.

830
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:55,850
She spared him?

831
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,770
Yeah, otherwise I'll get terrible ranking.

832
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:05,390
Oh my god, that's a door.

833
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,350
I was gonna say, this looks like a boss area.

834
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,470
Don't kill them, Jesse Fox.

835
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,030
I can't kill.

836
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:14,230
Jesse Fox can't kill.

837
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:15,990
It's game over.

838
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,740
Looks suspicious.

839
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,580
It's so suspiciously empty.

840
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:31,600
Okay.

841
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:38,680
I'm so hyped you're finally playing this, one of my favorites in the Metal Gear series.

842
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,080
I have an original cartridge.

843
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,400
Oh, wow, nice.

844
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,940
Thank you.

845
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,960
What's over here?

846
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,650
I wanna explore a little bit before we...

847
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,240
Sleepy guy.

848
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,080
See, this looks like it's filled with lasers or something, right?

849
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,720
I have full ammo.

850
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,060
So if I just press start... Oh my gosh, I can crawl.

851
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:20,720
That's crazy.

852
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,580
I can just crawl normally.

853
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,640
That's so fun.

854
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,060
Wait, who's... There's someone over there.

855
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,680
Hello, sir.

856
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,380
Can you move?

857
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,060
Can you leave?

858
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,460
Can you leave?

859
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:37,900
Oh my gosh.

860
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,100
Oh, not my way.

861
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:39,720
Oh my god.

862
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:40,660
Stop!

863
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,540
This guy sucks.

864
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,320
Oh my god, I just need to go.

865
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,860
Everything is a jump scare in this series, I swear.

866
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,740
Alright, let's go through here.

867
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,040
It's awfully suspicious though.

868
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,780
Oh, what's over here?

869
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:08,800
Fun.

870
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:15,920
Stop!

871
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,400
Can you knock out people in the game without harming them?

872
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:27,240
I think people were saying that it's two knockouts equals a kill.

873
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,600
So, honestly, I don't really care about rankings.

874
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,340
You know me.

875
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,880
I don't really care about that kind of stuff.

876
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,280
But...

877
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,460
Oh my gosh, go in.

878
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,240
But I think I can just knock them out.

879
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,500
Oh my god, there's someone up here.

880
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,600
Can you make the screen... Can you hold B?

881
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,180
Oh wow, fun.

882
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:55,860
Thank you.

883
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,320
How do I get past this guy?

884
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,080
Don't look over here.

885
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,460
Maybe I can knock him out.

886
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,340
Is there anything here?

887
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:08,800
Oh, no.

888
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,800
There's nothing here.

889
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,220
I did that for no reason.

890
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,380
This is fine.

891
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,400
B.

892
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,040
There's a car.

893
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:24,930
What was the point of that?

894
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,610
Nothing here.

895
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,950
These boxes are huge.

896
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,170
I look so tiny.

897
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:46,450
There was a door north.

898
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,870
I had the... It went boop boop.

899
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:51,730
Oh no.

900
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,070
It's a little maze.

901
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:57,170
Not a maze, but...

902
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:02,870
Thank you for the...

903
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,070
Oh my gosh.

904
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:15,130
There we go.

905
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,250
Knock him out.

906
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:17,450
Run over here.

907
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:18,770
Into this area.

908
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:19,830
Go into here.

909
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:22,270
Is it just ammo that I'm not gonna be able to carry?

910
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:23,530
Hello?

911
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:24,290
Wait.

912
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:24,750
Hello?

913
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:26,470
Hello?

914
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:27,990
Push.

915
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:28,910
Push.

916
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:29,450
Wait.

917
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:29,750
Hello?

918
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:30,730
Hello?

919
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:33,190
Hello?

920
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:36,830
How do I... How do I get...

921
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,570
I need to shimmy.

922
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,150
I didn't know you could do that.

923
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:41,890
Oh my gosh.

924
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,170
I knew it.

925
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,070
Come on, snake.

926
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:50,150
You can shimmy.

927
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:52,530
Wow, this game is insane.

928
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,850
Lucky, thanks for the gift, dude.

929
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,920
Can they see me?

930
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:02,920
Hey, mister.

931
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,380
Can you see me?

932
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,060
Guess not.

933
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,140
And there's a door right here, too.

934
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,220
Oh, this guy is gone, so let's go through.

935
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,200
There's also another door over there.

936
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:17,520
Okay.

937
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,260
I'm just going through everything.

938
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,900
It's crazy.

939
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,400
What's this?

940
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,440
An R... S?

941
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,220
Or 5?

942
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,720
S or 5?

943
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,480
Mysterious.

944
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,540
R5.

945
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,900
So that's not a door up north?

946
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,640
There was a door that... Oh, this?

947
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,780
This is not a door, I don't think.

948
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,840
If it is, I can't do anything with it.

949
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,500
Oh gosh.

950
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,520
There was one of these doors here.

951
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,720
But on the other side.

952
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,300
But it needed a code.

953
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,280
Like a card, I guess.

954
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,660
That's a man.

955
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,180
Oh my gosh, that was close.

956
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,500
Let's see what this guy does here.

957
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,000
Does he come over?

958
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,960
He doesn't seem to.

959
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,680
It's a man.

960
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,880
Okay, so I think we're safe here.

961
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,840
Oh, there's a... I see the exit all the way on the right.

962
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,680
Oh my gosh.

963
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:38,840
Just a man.

964
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,800
Just a man.

965
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,080
I wonder how many bullets it takes to kill a person.

966
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,360
Maybe don't clip that out of context.

967
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,100
Careful not to accidentally knock on the wall, right?

968
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,000
At least one.

969
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:01,850
How do we want to do this?

970
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:04,030
Where does this...

971
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:05,850
Stuffed shark!

972
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:06,830
Thanks for the tank captain!

973
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,270
Okay, that guy...

974
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,870
This guy that's walking towards me now, he just...

975
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:14,030
I think I need to go...

976
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,390
Upwards and around.

977
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,120
Oh my god.

978
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,840
I took a risk.

979
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,140
I took a risk, baby.

980
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,760
Holy moly.

981
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,220
There's that one room.

982
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,140
I want to go in, but I don't know if I can.

983
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:53,640
Ration!

984
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,160
Actually blind guards.

985
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,460
Leave him alone.

986
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,780
Leave him alone.

987
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,320
Look, they're tired.

988
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,260
They're just sleepy guys, okay?

989
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,260
Hello?

990
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,180
What are you doing?

991
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:16,940
Oh shoot.

992
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,380
I thought he was asleep!

993
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:25,460
I

994
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,440
made it.

995
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,930
Is anyone out there?

996
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,150
Who could this be?

997
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:48,850
Can anyone hear me?

998
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,330
This is...

999
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:57,930
Who is this?

1000
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:00,850
Thank god!

1001
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,540
It's Aerith from Final Fantasy series.

1002
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:07,700
Final Fantasy 7.

1003
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,000
This is Sergeant Chris.

1004
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,020
Oh, it's Chris.

1005
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:12,540
Sorry.

1006
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,020
Chris, you're very beautiful.

1007
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:17,800
I'm so sorry.

1008
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,820
Pretty lady.

1009
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:27,660
Unless Chris... Chris is a gender neutral name actually I feel, right?

1010
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,600
Chris is gender neutral.

1011
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:33,140
It could be.

1012
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,060
I can't tell.

1013
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,160
It's fine.

1014
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:35,700
Yeah.

1015
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,960
This is Sergeant Chris Jenner of Delta Force.

1016
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,760
A survivor of Delta!

1017
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,600
Delta Force.

1018
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,680
A survivor.

1019
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,760
That's literally what I just said Snake!

1020
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,460
It wasn't annihilated.

1021
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,340
No.

1022
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,620
Who are you?

1023
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:57,000
The U.S.

1024
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:57,960
rescue team?

1025
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,880
U.S.

1026
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,600
rescue person?

1027
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,140
No.

1028
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,260
I'm the black sheep you were supposed to work with.

1029
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,380
Not Foxhound?

1030
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,140
Foxhound!

1031
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,980
Isn't this a Gameboy Metal Gear minto?

1032
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:18,900
It is, yeah!

1033
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:21,460
Solid Snake speaking.

1034
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,040
First name Solid.

1035
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,980
Last name Snake.

1036
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:29,980
You always find me solid.

1037
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,040
You!

1038
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,560
You!

1039
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,400
I've heard things about you!

1040
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,160
What kind of things?

1041
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,300
The best saboteur ever.

1042
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:55,380
The one who destroyed Metal Gear in Outer Heaven seven years ago.

1043
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:59,260
What age does this put Snake at then?

1044
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:03,520
I guess maybe, say he was in his early 20s.

1045
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:13,300
In the first couple of games, then he's in his 30s or late 20s in this probably.

1046
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:14,780
17.

1047
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:23,130
He was on, you know, he should have been in Solidus' army.

1048
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,770
Three years before MGS1.

1049
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:30,530
And he's in his 30s in MGS1.

1050
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:35,330
The legend.

1051
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,910
Don't believe everything you hear.

1052
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:48,120
Some say I'm just an attention seeking killer.

1053
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,320
This is the skin of a killer Bella.

1054
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,960
He's a grandpa now.

1055
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:55,500
Stop!

1056
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,820
He just feels perpetually 30 to me.

1057
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,240
I get that though.

1058
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,200
So, which is true.

1059
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,740
Make up your own mind.

1060
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,740
Sergeant Jenner, are there any other survivors?

1061
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,440
From the unit besides you?

1062
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,740
No, everybody else.

1063
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,740
They're monsters sir.

1064
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:28,440
They?

1065
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,400
You mean those mercenaries?

1066
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,140
Yes, especially the leader.

1067
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,440
A man called Viper.

1068
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,860
I was called that once before.

1069
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:48,180
The subtitle Ghost Babble made me think this was a fan game for you.

1070
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,380
Mental Gear Solid win.

1071
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,280
Yeah, funny right?

1072
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,740
There was nothing we could do.

1073
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,640
Even if it wasn't an ambush.

1074
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,760
An ambush?

1075
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,080
The mission was leaked?

1076
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,180
I don't know, but...

1077
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,240
Sorry, I heard something outside my window.

1078
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:18,530
This is an absolutely classified mission.

1079
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:24,710
There is no way it could have been compromised.

1080
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:30,030
Unless someone on the inside leaked it.

1081
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:32,590
Wanna bet?

1082
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:37,650
There's always someone who's willing to sell out.

1083
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:43,250
What makes an American brass tick?

1084
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:44,830
What?

1085
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,430
What does that mean?

1086
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:48,150
Good morning Mito.

1087
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,330
Good morning Mito.

1088
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:54,250
Money, power, glory, women, men.

1089
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:56,490
Both.

1090
01:04:58,970 --> 01:04:59,330
Can it.

1091
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:01,970
There is no risk of spies here.

1092
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:06,730
We literally have a man on our team named Weasel.

1093
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:13,370
I don't know what you're expecting here.

1094
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:18,170
But there's a guy on our team that they didn't even trust.

1095
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:23,790
He's just as good as Snake apparently, but they didn't even trust him enough for the mission.

1096
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:31,970
Pretty sure, aren't you?

1097
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:42,070
Everyone involved in this mission has undergone rigorous background checks.

1098
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:43,930
Especially Weasel.

1099
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:47,830
This guy, okay, McBride is definitely the guy who's gonna betray us.

1100
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:50,070
Also the shading on...

1101
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:54,650
Give McBride some contour please.

1102
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,610
Look at Snake compared to him.

1103
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:01,130
It's crazy.

1104
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:07,230
Snake is a chiseled Greek god and McBride over here is Silly Putty.

1105
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,690
This poor man.

1106
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:13,910
I see.

1107
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:15,990
They're all trusting.

1108
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:19,990
How about it, Colonel?

1109
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:24,390
This is a top secret mission.

1110
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:28,490
Only a handful of people know of it.

1111
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:32,150
In the government and the military.

1112
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,510
I have to agree with McBride.

1113
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:38,050
Even Colonel looks better.

1114
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:39,470
Colonel just looks old.

1115
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:43,150
Snake is totally mewing though.

1116
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:50,350
How about it, Colonel?

1117
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:52,570
Alright.

1118
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,050
Sergeant Jenner.

1119
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:58,970
Is Metal Gear really inside the fortress?

1120
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:01,110
Yes.

1121
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:04,730
I still don't have the exact location.

1122
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:09,250
But the assembly is apparently near completion.

1123
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:16,490
And the researchers have been confined to another building.

1124
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:21,870
Do you have the location of the researchers?

1125
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:24,250
I'm sorry.

1126
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:30,170
All I know is they're somewhere here in Gallowade.

1127
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:30,670
Okay.

1128
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,890
Real helpful.

1129
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:33,770
Okay.

1130
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:36,970
How did you enter the fortress?

1131
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:40,530
Through the drainage system.

1132
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,910
Through the front door, dummy.

1133
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:46,130
The drainage system.

1134
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:48,650
Bingo.

1135
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:53,370
You saw those buildings with recessed east walls?

1136
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:54,990
Did we?

1137
01:07:54,990 --> 01:08:01,050
There are hidden access ways down into the... Oh yes, yes, yes.

1138
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:03,270
We saw the ladders into the ground.

1139
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:08,990
In those recesses...

1140
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:13,130
Building with an indented east wall.

1141
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:17,730
Entry into an underground route in the recess.

1142
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:19,650
Got it.

1143
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:21,750
Reese's.

1144
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:23,150
Reese's booth.

1145
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:25,950
Get yourself back there and get out of here.

1146
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,210
No.

1147
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:29,010
I'm staying here.

1148
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:31,210
No.

1149
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:32,370
You're not.

1150
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,130
You're just going to get in my way.

1151
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,930
I have no time to babysit a brownie.

1152
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,010
You get out.

1153
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:45,670
No.

1154
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:49,130
Sergeant.

1155
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:51,850
I will not abandon the mission.

1156
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:52,470
Wow.

1157
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:54,370
Loyalty to the mission.

1158
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,350
Also, loyalty to the con.

1159
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:57,130
MGSCon.

1160
01:08:57,530 --> 01:09:01,070
Pinned Kickstarter in chat.

1161
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:04,010
And in the description.

1162
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:08,830
But... I have to finish this.

1163
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:13,250
Amazing.

1164
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:13,850
Subtle ad.

1165
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:14,190
Thank you.

1166
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:18,390
For your fallen comrades.

1167
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:24,860
Why are we so quiet?

1168
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,440
Snake.

1169
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:31,400
Having an ally in the field could be useful.

1170
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:34,360
Please, sir.

1171
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:37,920
Alright.

1172
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,660
You've got guts.

1173
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,260
I'll grant you that.

1174
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:44,920
Thank you.

1175
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,620
We'll rendezvous inside the fortress.

1176
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,720
In the meantime.

1177
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,840
In the me... meantime.

1178
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,660
Is meantime supposed to be one word?

1179
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:00,920
Ulyssa.

1180
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:01,760
Welcome to the membership.

1181
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:02,320
Thank you.

1182
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,800
Gather as much intel as possible.

1183
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:06,680
Got it.

1184
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,040
In the meantime.

1185
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,140
I think it is.

1186
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:12,460
Really?

1187
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,000
In the meantime is correct.

1188
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,860
You watch out for your own back until then.

1189
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,380
Of course.

1190
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:22,860
And no cowboy acts.

1191
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:29,920
I love the codec effects on their little portraits.

1192
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,120
It looks so good.

1193
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,760
I can't get over how good this game looks.

1194
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,600
No cowboy acts.

1195
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:35,320
What does that mean?

1196
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:36,720
I know that.

1197
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,660
Oh no.

1198
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,240
I just did a cowboy act.

1199
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,880
And one other thing.

1200
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,240
Yes?

1201
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,940
But sir, how am I supposed to practice my lasso?

1202
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,420
Indiana Jones would hate this.

1203
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,760
Can I call you Chris?

1204
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,360
Okay.

1205
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,620
We don't know each other that...

1206
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,240
Rejected!

1207
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,540
Oh my god!

1208
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:20,870
Can you just imagine the game over screen?

1209
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:23,030
Showing up.

1210
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:25,410
Just mental damage.

1211
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:29,370
We can easily change that.

1212
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:35,510
Solid Snake you dog!

1213
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,690
As comrades in arms?

1214
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:41,690
That's up to you.

1215
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:44,650
Okay.

1216
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:53,470
My frequency is 140.25 Ask me if you have any questions about the fortress.

1217
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,950
Okay.

1218
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:57,210
Chris.

1219
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:00,250
Thank you!

1220
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:03,170
Good luck Snake.

1221
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:05,570
Can I call you maid?

1222
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:09,550
We don't know each other that well.

1223
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:12,870
Alright Snake.

1224
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:17,550
Look for that way into the duct that...

1225
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,470
Sergeant Jenner was talking about.

1226
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:25,090
Can I call you freak?

1227
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:29,110
Go to the building with the recessed east wall.

1228
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:35,870
And get underground from the concealed entry point in the recess.

1229
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:39,870
Now I saw buildings...

1230
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:42,150
With...

1231
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:44,250
Like...

1232
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:46,190
You know...

1233
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,600
Hello?

1234
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,260
Chris!

1235
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,080
Snake!

1236
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,980
You need card 1 to open that door.

1237
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:01,980
Card 1 should be in that truck to the north west.

1238
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:02,760
Oh, cool.

1239
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:06,540
Wow, Chris is actually so helpful.

1240
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:08,920
North west?

1241
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,140
Where am I?

1242
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:12,620
Okay, I came from over here.

1243
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,580
Wait, there weren't people before over here.

1244
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:17,460
Now there are.

1245
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:19,000
Oh shit, I shouldn't have left.

1246
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:22,140
I

1247
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:27,930
shouldn't have left.

1248
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:30,230
There weren't people before.

1249
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:33,150
Oh my god.

1250
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,070
Oh my god!

1251
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,920
North west.

1252
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:50,460
Truck?

1253
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:53,320
All the way here?

1254
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,060
I

1255
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:02,540
feel like I'm lost.

1256
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,600
Did the guards reset?

1257
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,280
Because there definitely wasn't a guard right there before, I think.

1258
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,860
More north and more west.

1259
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,180
Am I not as north as it goes?

1260
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:22,920
Keep going north?

1261
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:23,580
Oh, okay.

1262
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,960
Have I not been here before?

1263
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,050
I was wondering what that... Oh, here!

1264
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:39,890
Go in.

1265
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:41,910
I got it!

1266
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:45,890
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

1267
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:49,090
Card ID 1.

1268
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:50,450
And...

1269
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:54,290
I didn't go that far from where I...

1270
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,050
I'm so confused.

1271
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:00,770
So confused where the heck I am.

1272
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:03,170
Yeah, they...

1273
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:19,840
Scared.

1274
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:21,200
Wait, I think I'm good.

1275
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:21,760
There we go.

1276
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:28,300
Okay, now I don't know what this guy on the right does, so we'll chill here for a second.

1277
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,640
Wait, what's down here?

1278
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,900
What is over here?

1279
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:33,820
Is this open?

1280
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,640
What am I hearing opening?

1281
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:38,820
You hear that?

1282
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:42,860
Oh, here.

1283
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,460
I found it!

1284
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:49,360
I'm too good at this.

1285
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,720
I think I found it.

1286
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:02,840
Uh...

1287
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:16,180
They're gonna hear the noise travel through the pipe and they're gonna think this place is haunted and I'll leave.

1288
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,220
That's why it's Ghost Babble.

1289
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,140
Is there a breakable wall?

1290
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,800
I don't...

1291
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,720
I don't know.

1292
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:40,470
There has to be something here, right?

1293
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:46,750
This isn't just a place you go to when you get caught and you wait for the alert to end, right?

1294
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:57,800
Is this the wrong recess?

1295
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:58,320
Dang.

1296
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:08,750
Thank you, thank you!

1297
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:14,090
This guy scares me.

1298
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:18,310
Wait, can I... I can't go through there.

1299
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:18,590
Okay.

1300
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:24,990
Sometimes it's hard to tell where I can go and where I can't.

1301
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:28,790
Hey man, where are you going?

1302
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:35,110
I'm being so secretive.

1303
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:38,370
So sneaky.

1304
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:43,350
Wait, where is that door?

1305
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:46,390
Okay, this is where we climb through.

1306
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:50,170
Where was I?

1307
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:52,910
Why is this all so confusing?

1308
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:54,770
Just run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

1309
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:56,230
Okay, we went into here.

1310
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:57,670
There was nothing in here, I think.

1311
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:02,470
This is the one that needs...

1312
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,430
I got the key!

1313
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:04,570
What are you talking about?

1314
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:09,330
Do I have to equip it?

1315
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:10,850
Is it one of these types of games?

1316
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:12,450
ID card.

1317
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:27,800
Don't turn around.

1318
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:28,780
Yeah, that's right.

1319
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,640
Oh wait, I think I need to go up here.

1320
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:33,940
And then we do the same thing here.

1321
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:35,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1322
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:37,100
Okay, this is it.

1323
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:37,940
This is the one!

1324
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,440
Can you sneeze?

1325
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,280
Oh my god, I see it!

1326
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:46,700
I see the pipe!

1327
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:48,080
No!

1328
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,560
Guys, I don't think this is the one.

1329
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:56,760
Not this one.

1330
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,760
I only remember...

1331
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:03,200
Anything in here?

1332
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,320
Bullets that I don't need.

1333
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,040
Okay, there's this one over here.

1334
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,440
Alright, we have to go all the way back.

1335
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,260
I'm just gonna run.

1336
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,260
I'm gonna not get caught on...

1337
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,260
Oh my god!

1338
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:23,760
Oh my god!

1339
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:24,280
Oh my god!

1340
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,360
I shoot...

1341
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,140
Please don't kill me.

1342
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,140
Please don't kill me!

1343
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:32,620
Oh my god.

1344
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:39,690
What do you mean I fall over ashes?

1345
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:41,210
No!

1346
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,870
Oh my god, I ran right into that guy.

1347
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:48,030
It sucks so bad.

1348
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:50,990
Oh my god, there's...

1349
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:56,310
Run, run, run, run, run!

1350
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:57,250
Just go!

1351
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:06,410
Hide.

1352
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:07,210
Shimmy?

1353
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:07,770
Shimmy?

1354
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,130
Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.

1355
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:11,570
They'll never find me.

1356
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:12,830
They'll never find me.

1357
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:15,610
Yeah, dummies.

1358
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:16,990
Yeah, stupid.

1359
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:18,710
You don't know how to shimmy.

1360
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:23,690
Okay, you can leave.

1361
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,780
You can leave now.

1362
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,540
How do I use my ration again?

1363
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,900
Maybe I should go get that other one that I couldn't pick up.

1364
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,060
B to use.

1365
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,900
Boss Toaster, thanks for the gift!

1366
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,500
Okay.

1367
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,520
Well, that was... something.

1368
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,300
Oh my gosh.

1369
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,200
What's in here?

1370
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,620
A whole lot of nothing.

1371
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,300
I thought, though...

1372
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:09,250
I thought, though, that...

1373
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:15,290
Yeah, you can see that there's a hidden entrance in the one...

1374
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:17,290
In the other... what's it called?

1375
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:20,370
Building right below me.

1376
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:22,110
You can see it on the map.

1377
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:25,730
Is this guy gonna turn around or...

1378
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:26,150
What are you doing?

1379
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:26,730
Okay, good.

1380
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:29,170
Oh wait, this is the truck I just went into.

1381
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,790
It's right...

1382
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,610
It's like right...

1383
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:38,090
Here.

1384
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:40,430
Maybe not.

1385
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,320
Crawl?

1386
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:02,500
I don't think so.

1387
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:05,140
Unless here?

1388
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:06,300
No.

1389
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,680
Once this guy moves, I'll go through.

1390
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:16,840
This guy.

1391
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:18,200
He's the one who got me.

1392
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:19,120
What a jerk.

1393
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,320
He's the one that caught me before.

1394
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,920
I don't necessarily like that their positions reset.

1395
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,120
Oh, what about down here?

1396
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,300
Does this one have one?

1397
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:49,060
Does this have a secret?

1398
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,080
A little recess?

1399
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,020
Oh, I got more ammo!

1400
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:56,160
Snake, look out!

1401
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:56,660
A camera!

1402
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,080
Oh my gosh.

1403
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:00,520
This is why I don't like that their positions reset.

1404
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:03,260
This freaks me out.

1405
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,130
Basically, I think back at the beginning though.

1406
01:23:12,710 --> 01:23:14,270
We went in this one, didn't we?

1407
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:16,910
Almost positive we did.

1408
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,090
Not yet?

1409
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:28,150
Okay, let's try it.

1410
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:36,300
ID card.

1411
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,800
We didn't go in this one?

1412
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,400
Got it right!

1413
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,120
Yippee!

1414
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,680
I totally thought I had.

1415
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:50,900
Let's go.

1416
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:01,610
Cutscene.

1417
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:06,230
Yippee!

1418
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:07,070
Terrible!

1419
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:17,880
One guy.

1420
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,180
I got one guy, you guys.

1421
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,780
What a thrill.

1422
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,720
Moshi moshi.

1423
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,920
Chris, at the duct entrance.

1424
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:32,920
Where are you?

1425
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:35,500
In the building.

1426
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:38,020
Right above the duct you are in.

1427
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,580
Okay, come meet me down here.

1428
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:41,620
Pretty near.

1429
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,000
I'm about to find out what I can hear.

1430
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,340
How?

1431
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,660
I got an enemy trooper uniform.

1432
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,240
Give that to me!

1433
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:55,920
Give that to me!

1434
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,960
Terrible means good like Les Enfants Terribles.

1435
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,280
Yeah, exactly!

1436
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:06,400
I keep misspelling Master of Stealth as terrible.

1437
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,280
That's okay Mint, most of my ranks are terrible and I know this game backwards.

1438
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:13,080
Okay, that makes me feel better.

1439
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:13,640
Thank you.

1440
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,740
It should let me blend in and listen in.

1441
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:20,440
Chris.

1442
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,200
Don't worry.

1443
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,600
I'll find out where the researchers are.

1444
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:28,660
Wait, give me the uniform.

1445
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,400
I need it more than you.

1446
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,460
Don't overdo it.

1447
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,140
The rank is a meme?

1448
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:35,780
Okay, good.

1449
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:38,200
Codename terrible Minto.

1450
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,440
Hi Doug.

1451
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,840
I watched your stream in my dream today.

1452
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:47,640
I don't know what you were doing, but you had 300k subs.

1453
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,360
Wow!

1454
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,580
Maybe one day.

1455
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:54,320
I know.

1456
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,620
I'll go up to your floor and we'll rendezvous.

1457
01:25:59,500 --> 01:25:59,740
There.

1458
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:04,400
I'll be disguised, so no codec contact.

1459
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:05,720
Contact.

1460
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,800
Make voice contact when I'm alone.

1461
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:09,920
I'll go, hello!

1462
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,220
Alright.

1463
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:19,360
But aren't you wearing the same uniform as the enemy?

1464
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:27,860
How am I supposed to spot you among all the enemy soldiers?

1465
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,020
What's the plot so far?

1466
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:32,200
Infiltrate Fortress.

1467
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,120
Defeat Metal Gear.

1468
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,320
What about my hairstyle?

1469
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,720
I really thought they were going to say, what about my butt?

1470
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:44,960
I have my hair tied up at the back.

1471
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:50,620
You should be able to recognize me from that, okay?

1472
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,620
Hairstyle, huh?

1473
01:26:55,020 --> 01:27:01,240
Even among the GILF soldiers, there are heaps of guys with long hair.

1474
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,320
Yeah, you're right.

1475
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:08,780
Okay, how about if I wear a red cap?

1476
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:10,060
That's too obvious.

1477
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,500
Alright, I guess that works.

1478
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:21,660
If I see a soldier wearing a red cap with hair tied up at the back, it must be you.

1479
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:23,020
Got it.

1480
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,420
That's so obvious.

1481
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,160
Alright Snake, see you soon.

1482
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,840
Oh my gosh, an Ocelot cap perhaps?

1483
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,060
Oh my gosh, I'm too popular.

1484
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,480
Snake, rendezvous with Sergeant Jenner.

1485
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,820
She's in the watchtower above.

1486
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:45,240
Get through the duct and gain entry to the tower.

1487
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:47,520
Is there going to be a boss over here?

1488
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,160
Oh no, there's little guys walking.

1489
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,980
I haven't been codec-ing.

1490
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:57,480
Are codecs like fun in this game or...

1491
01:27:59,000 --> 01:27:59,640
Weasel.

1492
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:00,820
Let's talk to Weasel.

1493
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:08,710
That's a 5.7 pistol.

1494
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:13,290
A handgun designed for low recoil.

1495
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:17,570
High impact 5.7mm ammunition.

1496
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:22,970
The 5.7mm is a new type of cartridge.

1497
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:39,330
With its high muzzle velocity and pointed tip, it can penetrate most body armor without the usual downside of increased recoil and lowered targeting accuracy.

1498
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:45,150
The 5.7's magazine can... Why is 7 like the N?

1499
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:47,670
Capitalized.

1500
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:50,950
Can hold 20 rounds.

1501
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:55,670
Branding.

1502
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:56,970
Wait, actually...

1503
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:59,150
Oh, it's the brand.

1504
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:13,470
The use of industrial plastic cuts down on weight and probability of malfunctions.

1505
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:18,170
You can muffle the firing noise too if you can.

1506
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:20,050
Find a suppressor.

1507
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:20,910
That's what I did.

1508
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:24,330
That's a mean little handgun you've picked.

1509
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:25,370
Yourself.

1510
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:29,130
Let's also call McBride because I like him.

1511
01:29:31,490 --> 01:29:33,050
I think he's going to betray us.

1512
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:37,230
I've had the service records for that.

1513
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:39,770
Sergeant Jenner looked up.

1514
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:47,350
Real 5.7 actually has pretty intense recoil and a massive grip.

1515
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:50,390
So the game just lied to us.

1516
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:53,290
Jenner, Christine.

1517
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:55,670
Age 25.

1518
01:29:56,890 --> 01:29:59,010
In service for 8 years.

1519
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:06,510
As you can imagine from her having been chosen for this mission team.

1520
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:09,870
Her records are exemplary.

1521
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:12,650
Father and mother.

1522
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:18,930
Most people do have a mom and a dad.

1523
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:24,690
That's how most people arrive on the earth.

1524
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:27,990
No siblings.

1525
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:32,370
She enlisted when she was 17.

1526
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:39,630
Parents divorced when Jenner was 12.

1527
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:43,350
I don't think I need to know everything about her.

1528
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:46,270
Mother got custody.

1529
01:30:50,330 --> 01:30:51,250
Alright.

1530
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:55,450
The last name Jenner is her mother's.

1531
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:58,050
Father is an entrepreneur.

1532
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:03,010
Never missed an alimony or child support payment.

1533
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:04,950
Thank you.

1534
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:08,950
A very generous sum.

1535
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:13,710
More than enough for just two people to live on.

1536
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:14,330
Okay.

1537
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:21,450
It feels weird for Snake to not repeat the last sentence of the conversation.

1538
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:22,510
He does sometimes.

1539
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:26,830
Jenner certainly didn't grow up hungry.

1540
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:32,170
Joined the army immediately after graduation.

1541
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:38,110
From a big name school with excellent grades.

1542
01:31:38,110 --> 01:31:44,670
I'm surprised they didn't give the school name and also her address and her phone number and her three sizes.

1543
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:57,530
Cleared the selection process for Delta Force with flying colors only four years after completing basic training.

1544
01:31:59,610 --> 01:32:06,730
As you know, Delta Force doesn't take anyone less than best of the army's best.

1545
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:09,050
There's more?

1546
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:13,230
I know everything about her, but I also know nothing about her.

1547
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:22,390
Since then, she's been steadily moving up and evaluations by her CEO have been consistently high.

1548
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:28,750
She may be young, but there's no doubt about her abilities.

1549
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:32,950
Goodness gracious.

1550
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:37,450
Okay, this area is a little icky, I think.

1551
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,560
They rendezvous up there.

1552
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,120
Oh, uh, I'll go through here.

1553
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:47,200
Nice.

1554
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:49,680
I think I have all of this, yep.

1555
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:55,220
Holy moly.

1556
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,720
How do I get through here?

1557
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:01,800
I think I...

1558
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:04,520
What does the other guy do?

1559
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,260
He's just chillin' there?

1560
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,060
Oh, he didn't see me.

1561
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:17,440
He sucks.

1562
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:19,320
Sucks at his job.

1563
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,860
Is that a pit or is that the way it's just shaded?

1564
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:27,100
Is that like a... Oh, I guess we'll find out in a second.

1565
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:41,100
Oh, he can hear me.

1566
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:42,940
Oh my gosh, okay.

1567
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:44,560
Good to know.

1568
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:45,780
Good to know.

1569
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:49,440
Alright.

1570
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:54,770
If I... Can I walk?

1571
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:59,790
That guy is asleep.

1572
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:09,350
Once this guy goes down, we'll run up on him.

1573
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:13,650
Come on, I'm sleepy.

1574
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:17,990
Okay, keep on going.

1575
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:20,450
Awesome.

1576
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:21,590
A rat!

1577
01:34:24,090 --> 01:34:24,990
Rats.

1578
01:34:25,670 --> 01:34:26,290
Rats!

1579
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:27,490
Oh.

1580
01:34:29,010 --> 01:34:29,490
Okay.

1581
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:32,530
Is that a camera?

1582
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,110
Yes, it is.

1583
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:41,680
Oh, goodness.

1584
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:42,720
What is all that?

1585
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,400
Oh, there's people?

1586
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:44,340
Or...

1587
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:44,980
Oh my gosh, wait.

1588
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:49,940
More cameras or people?

1589
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:50,620
I can't tell.

1590
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:51,820
Oh, that's people, yeah.

1591
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:01,760
How do I want to proceed?

1592
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:04,900
Call Mei Ling?

1593
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:06,320
Why?

1594
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:10,000
Oh, wait.

1595
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,320
Why do I call Mei Ling?

1596
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:15,300
Stop.

1597
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:17,240
Oh, I almost used that on accident.

1598
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,240
Actually, hold on.

1599
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,400
We miss her.

1600
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:25,820
What?

1601
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:26,920
I thought there was a reason.

1602
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,040
McBride should know about the fauna.

1603
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:29,460
True.

1604
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:29,620
True.

1605
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:37,820
The total area of Kindra is...

1606
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:39,320
Oh my god.

1607
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:45,940
553,000 square kilometers.

1608
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:49,240
This doesn't help me!

1609
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:55,380
Population approximately 5 million.

1610
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:58,940
A relatively small state near the center.

1611
01:35:58,940 --> 01:35:59,680
Oh, shoot.

1612
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,640
Of the something.

1613
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,560
Under the rule of a military junta for the past five years.

1614
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:13,340
Three years ago, the charismatic so-called general, Agustin Aguaban.

1615
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:24,380
Led an armed uprising by the Kindra Liberation Front.

1616
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:25,780
Aquaman.

1617
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,500
Junta is a military dictatorship.

1618
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:34,420
I see, I see.

1619
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:36,520
A.K.A.

1620
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,040
Guilf.

1621
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:40,560
And the country has been in a state of civil war since.

1622
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,780
This doesn't help me at all!

1623
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:48,220
The UN Peacekeeping Force was deployed six months ago to put an end to the unrest.

1624
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,180
But there has been very little progress.

1625
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:53,380
Okay.

1626
01:36:54,460 --> 01:36:56,100
Guys, I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick.

1627
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:56,380
Sorry.

1628
01:36:57,820 --> 01:36:59,440
I will be... Let me put on some music.

1629
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:01,760
I'm going to put on the song that I played.

1630
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:03,300
Oh no.

1631
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:06,160
Shoot.

1632
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:10,620
Oh, I can't access... No, I can't access my...

1633
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:14,540
Okay, wait.

1634
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:14,820
Hold on.

1635
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:15,740
I have an idea.

1636
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:17,460
I'm going to put on the song.

1637
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:18,660
I have it.

1638
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,320
You guys can listen to it while I go to the bathroom.

1639
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,520
I just have to figure out...

1640
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,440
Not video source.

1641
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:26,560
Media source.

1642
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:28,140
Okay.

1643
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:32,420
I will be right back.

1644
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,080
Did that work?

1645
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:45,500
Yeah, okay, good.

1646
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:47,780
Wait, I'm going to do this real quick.

1647
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:50,500
Isn't this song cool?

1648
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,620
It was given to us for...

1649
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:58,780
For the streamers that are...

1650
01:37:58,780 --> 01:38:02,700
That are doing stuff for the convention.

1651
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:04,660
For MGSCon, so...

1652
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,320
It's an exclusive.

1653
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:08,860
It's so cool.

1654
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:13,100
I don't have the artist's name right now, but I'll put it in the description after...

1655
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,700
It's one of the streamers' friends, I think.

1656
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:19,940
I'll put it in the description after stream.

1657
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:21,220
Okay, I'll be right back.

1658
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:33,850
I'm back.

1659
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:37,830
I feel like I always go to the bathroom at the same time.

1660
01:40:39,870 --> 01:40:40,270
Like...

1661
01:40:42,910 --> 01:40:43,310
I...

1662
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:46,390
I start streaming and then about two hours in I'm like...

1663
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:47,030
I gotta pee.

1664
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:51,230
Okay.

1665
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:52,710
Cool.

1666
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:55,810
Alright.

1667
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:57,670
You guys want me to call Mei-Ling.

1668
01:40:57,790 --> 01:40:59,410
Okay, let me do that real quick and then we'll...

1669
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:00,910
I gotta figure out a plan for this.

1670
01:41:02,030 --> 01:41:02,670
Mei-Ling!

1671
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:04,130
You rang, Snake?

1672
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:06,930
Do I have to save?

1673
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:07,910
I guess I should save.

1674
01:41:08,030 --> 01:41:08,510
Save completed.

1675
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:08,970
Okay, cool.

1676
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:10,270
Oh, that was so easy.

1677
01:41:10,410 --> 01:41:10,990
So fast.

1678
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:14,970
Snake, I know this is a difficult mission.

1679
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:16,250
Oh my gosh, I accidentally pressed B again.

1680
01:41:16,530 --> 01:41:20,210
But as long as you have confidence in yourself, you can carry it out.

1681
01:41:20,730 --> 01:41:22,970
Confidence is the first rule of success.

1682
01:41:23,570 --> 01:41:24,590
Like Emerson said.

1683
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:25,990
Emerson.

1684
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:29,050
So you're a literature expert too.

1685
01:41:29,370 --> 01:41:30,430
Oh, sorry, that's him.

1686
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:32,270
So you're a literature expert too.

1687
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:34,190
Uh-huh.

1688
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:37,430
I knew you had me pegged as a hardware geek.

1689
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:40,490
No, not exactly, but...

1690
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:45,390
You know, I did take electives in college.

1691
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:46,210
Oh, that's her.

1692
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:47,610
Sorry, I keep getting it mixed up.

1693
01:41:47,870 --> 01:41:49,470
You know, I did take electives in college.

1694
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:51,430
I was gonna say, Snake, what the college?

1695
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:57,840
Oh my gosh.

1696
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:00,200
You know, I did take electives in college.

1697
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:04,440
I purposefully tried to learn things outside of my major too.

1698
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:07,480
I'd rather be a well-balanced engineer.

1699
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:09,980
So that's why you're always quoting.

1700
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:14,980
There's a lot to learn from things different people have said.

1701
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:18,280
Oh, make sure you get your exposure too.

1702
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,740
Oh my god, she's gonna expose me.

1703
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:23,180
Alright, let's see.

1704
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:29,260
These guys just kind of walk around together, I think.

1705
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:31,960
Or they don't.

1706
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:33,620
I thought they were like buddies.

1707
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,240
Maybe now.

1708
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:49,010
Okay, nice.

1709
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:50,870
Nice.

1710
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:52,410
Yippee!

1711
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:53,570
That wasn't so bad.

1712
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:54,650
That wasn't nearly as...

1713
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:56,190
Bats?

1714
01:42:57,890 --> 01:43:00,090
That wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

1715
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:07,240
What's that over there?

1716
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:08,140
A frog?

1717
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:10,380
No?

1718
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:11,100
Okay.

1719
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:14,080
Time to go... that way.

1720
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:18,660
What is all of this?

1721
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:22,960
What's wrong here?

1722
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:26,740
Soldier A.

1723
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,640
Zyren, thank you so much for 7 months!

1724
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:32,580
Is that poop?

1725
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,200
I sure hope not.

1726
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,400
Are you still hanging around here?

1727
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,480
What if this is their bathroom?

1728
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,820
Actually, guys, I didn't see a bathroom.

1729
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,560
This could just be like a communal toilet.

1730
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:51,030
You've already been ordered to withdraw from this area.

1731
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:52,880
Soldier B.

1732
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:53,890
Withdrawal?

1733
01:43:55,540 --> 01:43:58,380
I haven't heard anything about that.

1734
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,100
What's going on?

1735
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:05,060
There's a squall coming.

1736
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:05,960
A squall?

1737
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,440
The river is already flooded.

1738
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:16,180
And there's going to be a whole lot of water around here soon.

1739
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:20,700
First I've heard of it.

1740
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,840
Oh my god, they were going to let Soldier B die.

1741
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:26,700
Murd.

1742
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,440
If I'd stay here...

1743
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,000
You get the idea.

1744
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:34,360
Murd.

1745
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:34,880
Murdy.

1746
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:35,860
Murd.

1747
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,880
What the hell is that name?

1748
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,860
Come on, there's no time to lose.

1749
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:48,820
How soon are we talking?

1750
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,580
It's sounding very soon.

1751
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:06,700
What's in here anyway?

1752
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:09,600
Wait.

1753
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:16,740
Rude.

1754
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:24,140
What's up here?

1755
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:25,380
Nothing.

1756
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:26,000
OK.

1757
01:45:32,410 --> 01:45:34,450
I think the ladders are for holding on.

1758
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:36,390
Yeah, it seems to be the case.

1759
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:39,090
Is it going to be really obvious when it hits?

1760
01:45:39,630 --> 01:45:41,030
Oh no!

1761
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:42,450
I think it's hitting!

1762
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:45,630
Why does it sound so scary?

1763
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:45,670
Sorry.

1764
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:51,380
Oh I see.

1765
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:56,520
Oh my gosh.

1766
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:07,650
It happens so fast.

1767
01:46:12,190 --> 01:46:13,530
Please, please, please, please.

1768
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:14,410
Get to the next one.

1769
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:17,310
Oh my gosh.

1770
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,940
Oh my god.

1771
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:31,580
These are so scary!

1772
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:34,300
Oh my god.

1773
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:35,420
Please.

1774
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:36,940
Get me up.

1775
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,860
OK, I have to go through.

1776
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,500
I think it's every five seconds.

1777
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:47,280
OK, let's wait for the next one.

1778
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:48,500
Here it comes.

1779
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:49,940
Alright.

1780
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:51,760
Go through.

1781
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:54,860
I think... Oh no.

1782
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:00,040
Why does it go through the wall?

1783
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:04,630
Oh my god.

1784
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:06,930
I'm not going to make it.

1785
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:24,450
This one is craziness.

1786
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:28,070
Flushed.

1787
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:31,040
Run!

1788
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:34,780
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1789
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:36,440
Here it comes!

1790
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:40,480
I can't go in that one.

1791
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:41,960
Sucks.

1792
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:44,080
R5 ammunition, let's go!

1793
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:46,480
Here it comes!

1794
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:52,930
Why is this ladder unusable?

1795
01:47:54,190 --> 01:47:54,670
Run!

1796
01:47:54,850 --> 01:47:55,390
Oh my gosh, snake!

1797
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:56,810
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1798
01:48:02,110 --> 01:48:02,830
Oh wait.

1799
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:04,750
Secret.

1800
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:06,070
Cardboard box!

1801
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:08,290
Cardboard box in yellow!

1802
01:48:08,990 --> 01:48:09,330
Wait.

1803
01:48:12,410 --> 01:48:13,590
How do I use it?

1804
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:14,770
Oh, I did a secret.

1805
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:20,040
No!

1806
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:24,340
Hey!

1807
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:27,960
So fun.

1808
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:31,940
I wish it was easier to switch.

1809
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,640
Okay, so the next one...

1810
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,540
Go, go, go, snake!

1811
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,740
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1812
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:42,720
Go, go, go, go.

1813
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:43,140
This one.

1814
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:45,620
No?

1815
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:50,560
How do I...

1816
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:52,480
How do I use this one?

1817
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:57,880
The sound is horrible.

1818
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,640
That's not this one either, right?

1819
01:49:06,340 --> 01:49:07,580
Oh, it was.

1820
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:08,280
I'm just silly.

1821
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:09,820
Oops.

1822
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:13,780
Yay!

1823
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:22,730
I see a red hat.

1824
01:49:46,150 --> 01:49:48,030
Red cap.

1825
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:49,850
Is that not too obvious?

1826
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:52,630
I know.

1827
01:49:57,410 --> 01:49:58,170
Okay.

1828
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:10,170
That seems like...

1829
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:12,870
What if they all... What if it's red cap day at the base?

1830
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:17,850
Everybody wears red caps today.

1831
01:50:20,070 --> 01:50:21,330
Green cap.

1832
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:33,600
Close.

1833
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:36,700
Oh my gosh.

1834
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:38,500
If I were in the walls, he'd be able to see me.

1835
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:39,060
That's crazy.

1836
01:50:49,490 --> 01:50:50,370
More rations.

1837
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:52,350
Maybe I'll use the one that I have.

1838
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:54,410
Hold on.

1839
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:55,050
I have to remember.

1840
01:50:55,350 --> 01:50:55,570
Okay.

1841
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:56,190
Item.

1842
01:50:57,790 --> 01:50:58,230
Use.

1843
01:50:58,830 --> 01:50:59,270
Take.

1844
01:50:59,610 --> 01:50:59,930
Nice.

1845
01:51:06,430 --> 01:51:06,870
Okay.

1846
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:08,350
Security.

1847
01:51:09,950 --> 01:51:14,450
This area almost looks like the one actually from Outer Heaven before.

1848
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:17,870
Like in the original Metal Gear.

1849
01:51:18,010 --> 01:51:21,970
Like I feel like this one room below me...

1850
01:51:22,870 --> 01:51:24,870
This one room below me...

1851
01:51:25,570 --> 01:51:26,510
Is reminding me...

1852
01:51:26,510 --> 01:51:27,790
It's tool cameras!

1853
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:36,180
And that would have been like the gas room and stuff.

1854
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:39,920
Wait, I can box here.

1855
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:42,280
Surely it won't...

1856
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:44,320
The box works, right?

1857
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,040
With...

1858
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:47,960
The cameras, I imagine.

1859
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:53,000
Let's see.

1860
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:53,900
This is a test.

1861
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:00,540
It worked!

1862
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:01,980
Nice.

1863
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:11,780
What's over on the other side?

1864
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:16,940
Uh...

1865
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:20,360
In box

1866
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:27,710
we trust.

1867
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:28,990
So true.

1868
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:30,610
We got that at the perfect time.

1869
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:34,530
Okay, green hat.

1870
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:35,590
What are you gonna do?

1871
01:52:36,150 --> 01:52:36,810
Where are you gonna go?

1872
01:52:37,370 --> 01:52:37,970
Are you gonna go up?

1873
01:52:38,170 --> 01:52:38,810
Are you gonna go left?

1874
01:52:39,050 --> 01:52:39,570
Are you gonna go right?

1875
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:40,310
You're going up.

1876
01:52:40,470 --> 01:52:40,710
Okay.

1877
01:52:41,990 --> 01:52:42,530
Thank you.

1878
01:52:43,010 --> 01:52:44,230
Thanks for making a decision.

1879
01:52:44,710 --> 01:52:46,090
Oh, what's in here?

1880
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:48,710
A little hidey hole!

1881
01:52:49,050 --> 01:52:49,930
That's so cute.

1882
01:52:53,950 --> 01:52:55,570
Oh my gosh.

1883
01:52:56,170 --> 01:52:58,370
Brown hat.

1884
01:52:58,870 --> 01:52:59,530
Brown uniform.

1885
01:53:01,190 --> 01:53:02,130
Oh my gosh.

1886
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:02,710
No, no, no, no.

1887
01:53:03,190 --> 01:53:09,880
Just a box.

1888
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:09,960
Nice.

1889
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,440
The floor.

1890
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:18,880
I know.

1891
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:19,560
I saw it.

1892
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:20,280
I saw it.

1893
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:37,400
Can you shoot fire extinguishers?

1894
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,160
Honestly, I'm not sure.

1895
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:44,660
Please don't...

1896
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:46,160
Are you kidding me?

1897
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:46,240
Are you kidding me?

1898
01:53:49,180 --> 01:53:51,820
I'm gonna go hide in that hidey hole.

1899
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:52,380
Ouch!

1900
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:53,620
Run!

1901
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:55,280
Hidey hole!

1902
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:56,400
Hidey hole time.

1903
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:57,340
Hidey hole time.

1904
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:03,320
You can't shoot the extinguishers, unfortunately.

1905
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:04,140
Dang.

1906
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:06,680
We're fine.

1907
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:09,240
Oh, I didn't... Okay.

1908
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:11,220
Well, now I know how the cardboard box works.

1909
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:12,200
Look at me.

1910
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:14,240
I look like a real snake.

1911
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:24,300
They're scrambling.

1912
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:25,900
They have no idea what to do here.

1913
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:27,340
They have no idea what to do.

1914
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:29,500
Bite his ankle.

1915
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:31,240
I'm a chihuahua.

1916
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:34,240
I'm a chihuahua.

1917
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:41,940
Do you crawl as fast as you walk?

1918
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:44,300
I haven't really checked.

1919
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:47,220
No, you're definitely slower.

1920
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:48,980
Okay.

1921
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:49,080
Okay.

1922
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:54,320
Let's see.

1923
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:58,860
Let's box here.

1924
01:55:07,540 --> 01:55:08,620
Like so.

1925
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:12,240
We'll just be sneaky like this.

1926
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:13,580
Oh, wait.

1927
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:15,060
This is his path.

1928
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:15,640
Oh, shoot.

1929
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:18,580
This is his walking path.

1930
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:21,960
How do I want to do this?

1931
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:29,000
Oh, shoot.

1932
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:31,460
Oh, gosh!

1933
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:34,700
Back to my hidey hole!

1934
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:47,400
They have no idea where I am.

1935
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:48,160
They're stupid.

1936
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:00,890
The fact this works is hilarious.

1937
01:56:03,090 --> 01:56:03,830
I know.

1938
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:05,830
I love when the AI is so dumb.

1939
01:56:06,410 --> 01:56:07,730
It's my favorite thing.

1940
01:56:08,490 --> 01:56:10,150
I love dumb AI.

1941
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:15,730
Oh, dude!

1942
01:56:18,450 --> 01:56:20,950
That guy's path is all over the place.

1943
01:56:22,610 --> 01:56:23,210
Oh, shoot.

1944
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:34,820
I walked on it before and he heard me.

1945
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:37,980
But he didn't...

1946
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:40,940
The first time I didn't get caught with the box.

1947
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:42,560
It was the second time.

1948
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:46,860
If I can just get over to that one little area that is free...

1949
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:48,480
I'll be able to make it.

1950
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:49,240
You know what I mean?

1951
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:51,900
Can't you crawl on the grates?

1952
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,020
Yeah, but I'm afraid I'll get caught.

1953
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:55,600
They'll see me.

1954
01:56:56,660 --> 01:56:57,200
You know?

1955
01:56:57,700 --> 01:56:59,000
They'll see me crawling.

1956
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:02,000
I'm gonna test something real quick.

1957
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:02,240
Okay.

1958
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:04,980
Cause I'm real slow.

1959
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:06,940
Okay, hold on.

1960
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:08,300
Here.

1961
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:09,980
He's gonna move...

1962
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:10,460
to there.

1963
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:12,660
And I'm gonna do that.

1964
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:18,180
There we go.

1965
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:20,740
There we go.

1966
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:23,760
We did it, boys!

1967
01:57:23,980 --> 01:57:24,500
We did it.

1968
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:28,860
Just took a little bit of a...

1969
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:33,840
of a...

1970
01:57:35,950 --> 01:57:36,690
a way.

1971
01:57:39,570 --> 01:57:40,830
Okay, what's around here?

1972
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:41,470
What's in here?

1973
01:57:43,790 --> 01:57:44,970
That doesn't seem good.

1974
01:57:45,150 --> 01:57:47,250
Okay, let's...

1975
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:47,750
Wait.

1976
01:57:48,030 --> 01:57:48,590
Oh, no!

1977
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:49,270
Their hair!

1978
01:57:49,430 --> 01:57:51,930
But they're... But they have a brown cap.

1979
01:57:53,710 --> 01:57:54,190
Interesting.

1980
01:57:54,570 --> 01:57:54,790
Okay.

1981
01:58:04,090 --> 01:58:05,430
And we go up.

1982
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:06,170
No!

1983
01:58:07,790 --> 01:58:09,690
I have a card key.

1984
01:58:10,570 --> 01:58:11,230
Let me in.

1985
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:11,990
Now still?

1986
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:14,770
And we have a blue cap here.

1987
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:16,490
Wait.

1988
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:18,330
Wait, it was just blue.

1989
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:18,990
You said that.

1990
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:20,170
You guys... Did you guys see that?

1991
01:58:20,770 --> 01:58:21,690
Am I... I'm not crazy.

1992
01:58:21,690 --> 01:58:23,430
The hat was just blue.

1993
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,000
Huh?

1994
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:33,240
What was in here again?

1995
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:34,180
Oh, that's right.

1996
01:58:35,740 --> 01:58:36,860
You think it's fine?

1997
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:38,260
Let's...

1998
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:40,280
Let's crawl.

1999
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:44,500
Oh.

2000
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:45,300
Yeah?

2001
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:46,660
What are you gonna tell me?

2002
01:58:56,210 --> 01:58:57,270
My fogger?

2003
01:58:57,410 --> 01:58:57,590
Oh.

2004
01:58:58,570 --> 01:58:59,210
That's true.

2005
01:58:59,670 --> 01:59:00,370
The fogger.

2006
01:59:03,330 --> 01:59:05,150
How do I select start?

2007
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:07,050
No?

2008
01:59:09,050 --> 01:59:10,390
Select then start.

2009
01:59:10,530 --> 01:59:10,630
Oh.

2010
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:11,670
There we go.

2011
01:59:15,930 --> 01:59:17,590
Thank you, guys.

2012
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:37,170
But it should be detectable if the beam passes through vapors or smoke.

2013
01:59:38,390 --> 01:59:43,290
Do you have anything that can produce smoke or gas?

2014
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:43,890
Oh my gosh.

2015
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:45,310
Good thing I ate these cigarettes.

2016
01:59:46,670 --> 01:59:47,930
Nice pall-eiding.

2017
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:48,570
Thank you.

2018
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,980
How far does the smoke go?

2019
01:59:57,480 --> 01:59:58,300
I'm scared.

2020
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:00,400
Oh!

2021
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:01,780
Okay.

2022
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:05,480
Smoke.

2023
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:11,620
So if I just like walk upon it.

2024
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:11,860
Okay.

2025
02:00:17,070 --> 02:00:17,430
Okay.

2026
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:24,710
It's so scary.

2027
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:28,370
I'm just testing every way.

2028
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:28,870
Okay.

2029
02:00:29,870 --> 02:00:30,470
Okay.

2030
02:00:30,470 --> 02:00:30,610
Okay.

2031
02:00:31,370 --> 02:00:31,950
So down.

2032
02:00:33,690 --> 02:00:34,270
And over.

2033
02:00:43,610 --> 02:00:44,290
Sure.

2034
02:00:45,930 --> 02:00:46,850
What's in here?

2035
02:00:50,110 --> 02:00:51,270
More people.

2036
02:00:51,930 --> 02:00:52,610
Okay.

2037
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:53,610
I don't need this anymore.

2038
02:00:57,510 --> 02:00:59,270
Especially because there is a camera.

2039
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:03,210
She's so good.

2040
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:04,610
Don't I know it?

2041
02:01:07,110 --> 02:01:09,430
They're not gonna notice me, are they?

2042
02:01:12,930 --> 02:01:16,070
I can probably shimmy past the...

2043
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:19,530
The camera, I imagine.

2044
02:01:21,450 --> 02:01:24,370
Unless... Actually, let's wait for this person to go back.

2045
02:01:25,370 --> 02:01:27,810
Let's wait for them to come back up and around and then we'll go down.

2046
02:01:28,050 --> 02:01:28,870
So I don't have to shimmy.

2047
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:30,070
This is kind of annoying.

2048
02:01:31,070 --> 02:01:32,290
I love how the box looks in this game.

2049
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:33,570
It looks so good.

2050
02:01:33,570 --> 02:01:35,730
I can't get over how good this game looks.

2051
02:01:35,890 --> 02:01:36,930
It's so awesome.

2052
02:01:39,670 --> 02:01:40,250
We're waiting.

2053
02:01:40,530 --> 02:01:40,950
We're waiting.

2054
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:46,380
We're going.

2055
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:47,040
We're going.

2056
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:47,840
We're going.

2057
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:50,360
We're going.

2058
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:51,160
We're going.

2059
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:51,820
Is this a door?

2060
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:57,900
No, not the fogger.

2061
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:01,620
Where's my card key?

2062
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:03,320
Okay.

2063
02:02:08,190 --> 02:02:10,210
Gosh, I can't get through anything.

2064
02:02:10,330 --> 02:02:10,810
This sucks.

2065
02:02:11,470 --> 02:02:12,870
Denied all opportunities.

2066
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:17,470
What is this guy?

2067
02:02:17,590 --> 02:02:18,710
Oh, that's not a guy.

2068
02:02:18,810 --> 02:02:19,510
That is a camera.

2069
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:27,960
What?

2070
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:29,280
No way.

2071
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:30,280
No way.

2072
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:31,820
The camera was so good.

2073
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:33,100
I got the gas mask.

2074
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:33,660
That's nice.

2075
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:35,800
No, it was past me.

2076
02:02:35,860 --> 02:02:36,620
Are you kidding me?

2077
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:38,980
It was past me though.

2078
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:40,540
That's so messed up.

2079
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:46,140
I'm donezo, I think.

2080
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:53,880
One pixel off.

2081
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:55,980
Do you think they're going to come up here and notice me?

2082
02:02:59,500 --> 02:02:59,940
Evasion...

2083
02:03:00,980 --> 02:03:01,420
Evaded.

2084
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:03,500
Please don't notice me.

2085
02:03:05,020 --> 02:03:05,460
Gosh!

2086
02:03:07,620 --> 02:03:09,280
This is too real.

2087
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:11,160
This is too... Just Battle Gear.

2088
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:14,360
Wait, where the hell am I supposed to go then?

2089
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:16,040
Hey!

2090
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:16,880
Chill out!

2091
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:18,120
Stop hitting me!

2092
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:31,340
Shoot.

2093
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:41,480
You're dead!

2094
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:43,860
I

2095
02:03:54,350 --> 02:03:56,090
didn't get anything new.

2096
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:00,940
A new card key.

2097
02:04:01,060 --> 02:04:04,620
I got the gas mask, but we haven't experienced a gassy room yet.

2098
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:10,660
I think they respawn.

2099
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:11,680
Yeah, they did.

2100
02:04:11,780 --> 02:04:12,020
That's okay.

2101
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:14,820
I got the gas mask.

2102
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:16,620
Yeah, but we didn't see a gassy room.

2103
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:23,580
Did she forget she had a gun?

2104
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:26,020
No, but...

2105
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:30,820
If they respawn, what's the point anyway?

2106
02:04:43,190 --> 02:04:45,970
So, none of the doors in here...

2107
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:49,770
None of the doors in here...

2108
02:04:49,770 --> 02:04:50,830
We have to go back.

2109
02:04:50,830 --> 02:04:53,050
Was there a way I didn't go before?

2110
02:04:58,300 --> 02:04:59,260
That was close.

2111
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:13,640
I guess it's good that we got that, though.

2112
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:17,020
Oh my gosh, I used a whole ration.

2113
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:18,260
No way.

2114
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:19,160
Oh, fogger there.

2115
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:30,580
And then it was this way.

2116
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:32,140
Yeah.

2117
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:33,980
And then it was down.

2118
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:37,140
And then this way.

2119
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:38,180
Yeah.

2120
02:05:44,540 --> 02:05:45,100
Oh...

2121
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:55,320
Alright, we gotta be careful of the cameras for sure.

2122
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:56,700
That was so icky.

2123
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:01,620
Is that a door right next to the camera?

2124
02:06:01,980 --> 02:06:02,660
Or am I crazy?

2125
02:06:05,740 --> 02:06:07,280
Is this... Oh, this is a door.

2126
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:12,180
Is this a gassy room?

2127
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:14,180
Maybe not.

2128
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:17,320
Gas room!

2129
02:06:23,620 --> 02:06:24,920
We got it.

2130
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:28,320
Snake, gas!

2131
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:34,180
You've got to hold your breath in the gas.

2132
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:37,400
Your O2 gauge will go down.

2133
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:43,020
And once it runs out, your life will take a hard hit.

2134
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:46,400
Put on your gas mask.

2135
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:53,780
That way you can get through the gas without holding your breath.

2136
02:06:54,020 --> 02:06:58,320
And come out of that room alive.

2137
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:02,960
I knew it was the gas room.

2138
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:06,600
I knew it was the gas room.

2139
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:08,940
Nothing over here?

2140
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:09,140
Okay.

2141
02:07:10,940 --> 02:07:14,320
Wait, why is there a way to hide in here though?

2142
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:16,720
Oh my gosh, there's... Oh, no way.

2143
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:17,180
What?

2144
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:19,280
What are these guys doing though?

2145
02:07:19,660 --> 02:07:20,000
Huh?

2146
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:21,400
Oh my gosh, no way.

2147
02:07:27,350 --> 02:07:28,430
Oh my gosh.

2148
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:30,630
I'm gonna run out of O2.

2149
02:07:31,110 --> 02:07:31,850
Are you kidding me?

2150
02:07:36,090 --> 02:07:37,130
Okay, we gotta leave.

2151
02:07:37,430 --> 02:07:38,170
We gotta go back.

2152
02:07:38,230 --> 02:07:39,030
We gotta start over.

2153
02:07:39,370 --> 02:07:39,950
I'm gonna start over.

2154
02:07:40,070 --> 02:07:40,590
I'm gonna start over.

2155
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:43,910
I'm gonna start over.

2156
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:44,510
I'm gonna start over.

2157
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:45,070
I'm gonna start over.

2158
02:07:50,730 --> 02:07:52,530
Nononononononononononononononononononono Okay.

2159
02:07:55,430 --> 02:07:56,870
Alright, we'll just run for it.

2160
02:07:57,130 --> 02:07:57,490
Gas.

2161
02:07:58,170 --> 02:07:59,230
I got our gas mask on.

2162
02:08:01,450 --> 02:08:03,870
That was so close, wasn't it?

2163
02:08:04,650 --> 02:08:07,670
How am I supposed to get past this guy then?

2164
02:08:08,370 --> 02:08:09,230
Oh, like this maybe?

2165
02:08:10,950 --> 02:08:14,490
I think they want you to leave initially, you know?

2166
02:08:15,730 --> 02:08:16,070
Shoot.

2167
02:08:17,190 --> 02:08:19,070
They're just like, otherwise you'll have no idea.

2168
02:08:23,350 --> 02:08:24,910
Wait, but their hair is not out.

2169
02:08:27,590 --> 02:08:29,090
The hair isn't out.

2170
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:35,510
This isn't them, right?

2171
02:08:35,710 --> 02:08:36,490
This isn't Chris?

2172
02:08:36,870 --> 02:08:37,650
I don't think.

2173
02:08:38,530 --> 02:08:39,010
Oh my god.

2174
02:08:40,030 --> 02:08:41,310
No, it's not Chris!

2175
02:08:43,310 --> 02:08:43,390
No!

2176
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:53,260
Oh my god, please.

2177
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:11,260
This is so messed up.

2178
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:13,020
This is so messed up, please.

2179
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:14,460
Run, just run Snake!

2180
02:09:15,140 --> 02:09:18,200
And then... Oh, it stops in here.

2181
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:21,580
The game is a little bit forgiving.

2182
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:23,100
Just a tiny bit.

2183
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:24,680
Just a tiny bit forgiving.

2184
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:26,600
Okay, I'm gonna have to punch this guy out though.

2185
02:09:28,340 --> 02:09:29,140
I think.

2186
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:34,060
Okay, good night!

2187
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:36,220
Okay, level 2.

2188
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:42,300
That guy is trapped in there.

2189
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,340
What if he has to go to the bathroom and all?

2190
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:49,000
He's trapped in the room that's next to the gas room.

2191
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:51,980
They don't give him a bathroom or anything.

2192
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:54,200
They hate him.

2193
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:58,460
Alright, somehow we made it out.

2194
02:09:58,640 --> 02:09:59,440
Somehow.

2195
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:08,100
Oh, I'm in this...

2196
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:11,080
I'm in this area.

2197
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:13,500
I just made a big loop.

2198
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:18,820
Because this is where I first got caught by the camera.

2199
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:28,860
Oh gosh, I'm gonna let it go all the way down.

2200
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:31,900
As far down as it possibly can go.

2201
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:34,620
Okay, now I can go.

2202
02:10:36,940 --> 02:10:38,580
Now, I go.

2203
02:10:48,890 --> 02:10:49,910
Where are we?

2204
02:10:57,720 --> 02:10:58,960
Is this an elevator?

2205
02:11:04,650 --> 02:11:05,570
What is this?

2206
02:11:12,790 --> 02:11:13,510
Oh, there we go.

2207
02:11:15,450 --> 02:11:19,930
I'm gonna get in a box just in case someone comes out of the elevator.

2208
02:11:23,620 --> 02:11:24,360
We're safe.

2209
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:31,980
Think anyone's gonna ambush me on this?

2210
02:11:37,330 --> 02:11:38,710
Here we go.

2211
02:11:46,310 --> 02:11:47,590
Level 2.

2212
02:11:50,170 --> 02:11:50,810
Nice.

2213
02:11:51,930 --> 02:11:53,710
Oh, there's some stuff over there.

2214
02:11:54,210 --> 02:11:55,330
Whatever that room is.

2215
02:11:58,110 --> 02:11:59,770
Wait, I'm hearing something open.

2216
02:12:03,630 --> 02:12:05,330
I thought I heard a door go...

2217
02:12:08,170 --> 02:12:09,510
Maybe I'm crazy.

2218
02:12:10,730 --> 02:12:12,370
I thought I heard it though.

2219
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:21,540
Guess I didn't.

2220
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:24,800
Hey babe.

2221
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:28,320
Still no?

2222
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:31,680
Might have been the elevator closing.

2223
02:12:31,820 --> 02:12:33,360
Oh, I think you're right.

2224
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:35,240
I think you're right.

2225
02:12:40,940 --> 02:12:41,620
Two...

2226
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:43,040
Red herrings, that's funny.

2227
02:12:57,450 --> 02:12:58,530
Time to box.

2228
02:13:00,110 --> 02:13:01,850
I am once again a box.

2229
02:13:02,310 --> 02:13:04,490
Oh my god, that's a person, not a camera.

2230
02:13:08,410 --> 02:13:10,170
Turn around, go away.

2231
02:13:15,570 --> 02:13:16,770
Just a box.

2232
02:13:19,630 --> 02:13:22,970
Oh, still no?

2233
02:13:23,150 --> 02:13:23,390
Okay.

2234
02:13:24,750 --> 02:13:26,890
I am once again a box.

2235
02:13:29,730 --> 02:13:32,310
Gosh, this place is a horrible maze.

2236
02:13:32,670 --> 02:13:35,730
There was another door I think also.

2237
02:13:36,530 --> 02:13:38,230
The one over there.

2238
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:42,210
I don't know if I have enough time to get to it though.

2239
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:47,360
Yeah.

2240
02:13:48,640 --> 02:13:51,420
And the red hat person comes down here.

2241
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:52,840
So I think I need to...

2242
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:55,000
Let's get out of the box.

2243
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:58,240
And crawl.

2244
02:14:00,280 --> 02:14:02,040
I just want to see what's in there though.

2245
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:03,540
You know?

2246
02:14:10,610 --> 02:14:12,610
No way, they stop right here.

2247
02:14:13,530 --> 02:14:14,690
I wonder if I can knock them out.

2248
02:14:22,580 --> 02:14:23,060
Stop!

2249
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:27,000
Oh, come on, I didn't even need it.

2250
02:14:29,060 --> 02:14:29,540
Nevermind.

2251
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:31,000
Waste of my time.

2252
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:39,110
Box, box.

2253
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:42,090
Gosh, can you imagine if I hadn't gotten the box?

2254
02:14:42,310 --> 02:14:44,010
We'd be so screwed right now you guys.

2255
02:14:55,490 --> 02:14:58,810
Oh, this building design is horrible!

2256
02:15:00,810 --> 02:15:03,530
Who thought this was a good idea?

2257
02:15:04,890 --> 02:15:07,310
What the hell is this?

2258
02:15:10,110 --> 02:15:12,790
This is Big Boss' vision everybody.

2259
02:15:13,190 --> 02:15:14,770
This is what he would have wanted.

2260
02:15:15,490 --> 02:15:16,650
Okay, we are going to have to knock.

2261
02:15:17,970 --> 02:15:19,870
Be mostly box in there I think.

2262
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:26,020
Big Boss loved Uzumaki.

2263
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:28,400
He saw spirals everywhere.

2264
02:15:30,100 --> 02:15:32,280
Oh my gosh, I just realized the person coming up.

2265
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:34,340
Oh, good thing I was still...

2266
02:15:36,180 --> 02:15:36,700
hidden.

2267
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,620
Oh my god, do they just circle the entire...

2268
02:15:40,620 --> 02:15:41,360
What is this?

2269
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:43,060
What is this?

2270
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:46,620
Oh, I think they meet, they kiss and then they turn back around.

2271
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:47,240
Yep.

2272
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:51,300
No, they swap places.

2273
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:02,840
I don't know which way to go.

2274
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:05,280
Honestly.

2275
02:16:09,330 --> 02:16:11,030
I think to that door up there.

2276
02:16:14,530 --> 02:16:16,250
Oh wait, there is a door down here too.

2277
02:16:18,090 --> 02:16:18,530
Beep beep.

2278
02:16:21,010 --> 02:16:22,290
They meet and they kiss?

2279
02:16:22,410 --> 02:16:22,670
Yeah.

2280
02:16:23,330 --> 02:16:24,410
It's a little meet cute.

2281
02:16:24,770 --> 02:16:25,730
Oh, we can go in here.

2282
02:16:32,460 --> 02:16:34,120
Okay, up there looks like hell.

2283
02:16:39,490 --> 02:16:40,310
Wait a second.

2284
02:16:41,450 --> 02:16:43,610
Oh, this looks exactly like the other room where...

2285
02:16:43,610 --> 02:16:45,650
Remember where my little hidey hole is.

2286
02:16:47,150 --> 02:16:48,590
Wait, is there anything else in here?

2287
02:16:50,070 --> 02:16:50,890
Oh, there is a door.

2288
02:16:52,930 --> 02:16:54,070
Hold on, there we go again.

2289
02:16:57,360 --> 02:16:57,760
Gas.

2290
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:01,300
What about the other area though?

2291
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:02,020
The other location?

2292
02:17:05,720 --> 02:17:07,980
I guess we'll eventually make it back there.

2293
02:17:13,250 --> 02:17:13,710
No?

2294
02:17:26,390 --> 02:17:27,570
Sees laser, gas.

2295
02:17:27,730 --> 02:17:30,230
Sorry, I meant I need the smoke.

2296
02:17:30,330 --> 02:17:31,950
That's where my brain was.

2297
02:17:35,090 --> 02:17:37,310
Not that I thought it was a gas room.

2298
02:17:37,730 --> 02:17:40,550
Just that I'm like, oh, I needed the gas, you know.

2299
02:17:41,790 --> 02:17:43,170
I don't think you can crawl.

2300
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:44,250
They're double lasers.

2301
02:17:46,650 --> 02:17:51,030
I think vertically you can't see that there's two of them.

2302
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:52,290
I don't think you can crawl.

2303
02:17:56,410 --> 02:17:57,670
And I'll stand by that.

2304
02:17:57,930 --> 02:17:59,090
Because I think that's the truth.

2305
02:18:00,530 --> 02:18:00,810
Correct.

2306
02:18:01,510 --> 02:18:03,110
Yeah, I thought so.

2307
02:18:09,410 --> 02:18:10,450
My instincts!

2308
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:13,230
They all look to be doubles.

2309
02:18:13,230 --> 02:18:15,230
Yeah, I think just because it was...

2310
02:18:18,850 --> 02:18:19,810
It was...

2311
02:18:19,810 --> 02:18:21,690
Vertically, you can't really tell.

2312
02:18:21,970 --> 02:18:23,010
But yeah, that's the case.

2313
02:18:34,280 --> 02:18:35,240
What is...

2314
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:35,920
Is there...

2315
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:36,140
Oh!

2316
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:37,620
I'll take it.

2317
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:38,100
Nice.

2318
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:42,680
More ammo.

2319
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:45,720
And more ammo.

2320
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:47,760
Oh, nice.

2321
02:18:47,900 --> 02:18:48,680
Okay, I'll take that too.

2322
02:18:49,660 --> 02:18:50,700
Good instincts.

2323
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:51,740
Thank you.

2324
02:18:53,580 --> 02:18:54,500
Are there...

2325
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:55,980
Is there ever anything in these holes?

2326
02:18:57,360 --> 02:18:58,660
I must check the holes.

2327
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:06,600
Why does this room have so many hiding spots then?

2328
02:19:08,180 --> 02:19:08,700
Mysterious.

2329
02:19:14,360 --> 02:19:15,860
Okay, this is gonna be annoying.

2330
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:17,780
Because we have to go the other way.

2331
02:19:18,260 --> 02:19:20,240
So we're gonna have to just follow this person.

2332
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:23,640
Basically the entire way.

2333
02:19:30,930 --> 02:19:34,270
Unless I can knock them out and then...

2334
02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:38,050
Maybe they turn around here.

2335
02:19:38,710 --> 02:19:39,910
Nope, they just go around.

2336
02:19:44,750 --> 02:19:46,770
I'm gonna have to knock one out eventually.

2337
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:49,930
So...

2338
02:19:49,930 --> 02:19:51,090
Because they're gonna meet.

2339
02:19:51,250 --> 02:19:52,590
They're gonna meet and they're gonna kiss.

2340
02:19:54,210 --> 02:19:55,550
Or I can just hide.

2341
02:19:58,690 --> 02:20:00,090
Where's another hole?

2342
02:20:00,690 --> 02:20:02,070
They're gonna meet and kiss!

2343
02:20:04,230 --> 02:20:05,030
Ryan!

2344
02:20:05,610 --> 02:20:07,210
Thank you so much for the Haka Super!

2345
02:20:08,410 --> 02:20:10,250
Tactical espionage, amigo.

2346
02:20:10,710 --> 02:20:11,550
That's me!

2347
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:17,080
They kissed yours.

2348
02:20:18,420 --> 02:20:19,560
So lewd.

2349
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:24,760
Alright, what's the way we didn't go?

2350
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:33,620
Down this way.

2351
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:36,940
Is there a hidey hole?

2352
02:20:40,020 --> 02:20:40,560
Oh gosh.

2353
02:20:41,220 --> 02:20:42,020
Okay, he goes up.

2354
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:50,040
I'm missing my opportunity here.

2355
02:20:51,820 --> 02:20:52,900
Okay, around.

2356
02:20:56,740 --> 02:20:58,900
Now if I hide in here...

2357
02:20:58,900 --> 02:20:59,460
I'm sure...

2358
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,700
He's gonna come around soon-ish?

2359
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:04,660
Hopefully?

2360
02:21:10,390 --> 02:21:13,190
Because the ending is right down that hall.

2361
02:21:16,510 --> 02:21:17,950
Okay, here he comes.

2362
02:21:22,490 --> 02:21:25,010
Okay, bye!

2363
02:21:26,230 --> 02:21:27,150
Bye bye!

2364
02:21:32,320 --> 02:21:32,800
Sucker.

2365
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:32,860
Sucker.

2366
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:38,240
Oh, there was one down here, but...

2367
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:38,480
What?

2368
02:21:39,060 --> 02:21:39,420
No!

2369
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:45,380
Where do I go?

2370
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:46,440
Huh?

2371
02:21:50,890 --> 02:21:52,150
No way!

2372
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:01,320
The lasers.

2373
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:03,380
Oh, they're timed?

2374
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:09,700
So if I just stayed there longer...

2375
02:22:14,270 --> 02:22:15,960
That's what you're telling me.

2376
02:22:15,960 --> 02:22:19,780
Oh man, why didn't you tell me not to leave before?

2377
02:22:20,820 --> 02:22:22,920
Maybe you did and I just wasn't looking at you.

2378
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:23,520
I'm sorry.

2379
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:24,680
No!

2380
02:22:25,960 --> 02:22:26,880
Hold on.

2381
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:28,040
Let's wait for...

2382
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:33,280
You didn't ask.

2383
02:22:50,530 --> 02:22:53,790
Okay, everybody wants to be plissken today.

2384
02:22:53,850 --> 02:22:54,490
That's fine.

2385
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:00,600
It was...

2386
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:01,300
No, no.

2387
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:01,900
This way.

2388
02:23:03,580 --> 02:23:03,780
Oh,

2389
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:19,240
the laser is on the other side.

2390
02:23:19,320 --> 02:23:19,540
That's right.

2391
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:19,960
Sorry.

2392
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:22,120
I was scared for a second.

2393
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:22,760
I was like, wait a second!

2394
02:23:27,110 --> 02:23:28,450
And then I go up.

2395
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:31,130
Love seeing you play more Metal Gear!

2396
02:23:31,450 --> 02:23:32,770
Thank you, ComfyPanda!

2397
02:23:33,450 --> 02:23:35,050
Thank you for seven months too!

2398
02:23:38,110 --> 02:23:40,190
Okay, here we are back.

2399
02:23:41,710 --> 02:23:42,890
Wasn't so bad.

2400
02:23:43,950 --> 02:23:44,390
Alright.

2401
02:23:46,070 --> 02:23:46,510
Alright.

2402
02:23:51,550 --> 02:23:53,370
So eventually it turns off?

2403
02:23:54,050 --> 02:23:55,630
I think this one eventually turns...

2404
02:23:55,630 --> 02:23:55,750
Oh.

2405
02:23:56,490 --> 02:23:57,650
Ah, I see, I see.

2406
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:26,360
Yeah, take that!

2407
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:28,920
I hope there was nothing else in there.

2408
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:31,440
Actually, let's go back in.

2409
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:33,660
Because I want to see if there's anything on the other wall.

2410
02:24:34,480 --> 02:24:34,600
Oh.

2411
02:24:36,620 --> 02:24:39,160
You have to have that equipped, silly.

2412
02:24:51,560 --> 02:24:52,160
Oh.

2413
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:54,940
Turn off!

2414
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:56,300
Aha!

2415
02:24:56,620 --> 02:24:58,020
See, I knew there was another wall.

2416
02:24:58,360 --> 02:24:59,000
Or another door.

2417
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:01,320
I knew it.

2418
02:25:05,550 --> 02:25:06,750
And it's...

2419
02:25:06,750 --> 02:25:07,030
Whatever.

2420
02:25:07,370 --> 02:25:07,950
Okay, nevermind.

2421
02:25:09,010 --> 02:25:09,870
I don't care.

2422
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:33,040
Where is she?

2423
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:35,160
She could have picked a closer location.

2424
02:25:36,620 --> 02:25:37,220
Like...

2425
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:39,380
What the hell?

2426
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:40,120
Chris!

2427
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:44,620
Is that Chris that doesn't want to be called Chris?

2428
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:52,860
I think Chris might actually be the one in the left.

2429
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:57,000
I have a stinking suspicion.

2430
02:25:59,900 --> 02:26:01,220
That Chris is this one.

2431
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:02,240
I knew it.

2432
02:26:03,580 --> 02:26:03,780
Hey!

2433
02:26:07,070 --> 02:26:07,510
Snake!

2434
02:26:07,710 --> 02:26:08,710
It's me!

2435
02:26:10,230 --> 02:26:10,670
Chris!

2436
02:26:11,710 --> 02:26:12,950
Come over here!

2437
02:26:13,070 --> 02:26:13,950
I'm going to give you a...

2438
02:26:13,950 --> 02:26:16,410
Oh, if you knew everything that I went through to get through here.

2439
02:26:17,710 --> 02:26:19,170
Halfway across the base.

2440
02:26:19,510 --> 02:26:20,310
Goddammit!

2441
02:26:20,950 --> 02:26:21,710
Follow me.

2442
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:27,760
Oh, Chris.

2443
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:29,420
30 minutes!

2444
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:33,820
30 minutes, Chris!

2445
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:35,340
There you go!

2446
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:41,700
We won't have to worry about the guards here.

2447
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:44,080
Good.

2448
02:26:44,380 --> 02:26:45,860
We can talk.

2449
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:48,680
I'm terrible!

2450
02:26:50,620 --> 02:26:51,500
Oh my gosh!

2451
02:26:51,580 --> 02:26:51,860
Wait!

2452
02:26:51,980 --> 02:26:53,960
Chris is the lady in the heart!

2453
02:26:55,700 --> 02:26:56,980
Chris is...

2454
02:26:57,420 --> 02:26:58,620
Chris is...

2455
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:01,860
The lady in the...

2456
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:04,040
Like the box art.

2457
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:07,260
Sorry if you heard that.

2458
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:09,080
I'm having my sandwich.

2459
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:12,100
Which is actually my breakfast.

2460
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:16,080
But I've just been kind of nibbling on it all day.

2461
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:16,680
Hi.

2462
02:27:20,630 --> 02:27:22,570
Wow, she really does look like everything.

2463
02:27:26,210 --> 02:27:27,110
What is it?

2464
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:36,460
What kind of a sandwich?

2465
02:27:38,360 --> 02:27:39,640
Egg and bacon.

2466
02:27:46,670 --> 02:27:49,510
Lads and lasses and all in between, I think we need to face the music.

2467
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:51,070
Our Oshie is terrible.

2468
02:27:52,710 --> 02:27:52,930
Yup.

2469
02:27:53,690 --> 02:27:54,350
Call your grandma.

2470
02:27:54,550 --> 02:27:55,250
Call your dog.

2471
02:27:56,010 --> 02:27:56,510
Call your mom.

2472
02:27:56,590 --> 02:27:57,110
Call your dad.

2473
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:03,880
Sorry.

2474
02:28:04,320 --> 02:28:11,440
It's just that you're easier on the eyes than any other delta force operator I've met.

2475
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:14,120
As soon as she was like, what is it?

2476
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:19,380
I had a feeling he was gonna be like, I didn't expect you to be so cute.

2477
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:21,320
Call Walt Disney?

2478
02:28:21,460 --> 02:28:22,400
No, don't call that guy.

2479
02:28:26,500 --> 02:28:28,620
Is that your idea of a compliment?

2480
02:28:30,360 --> 02:28:31,660
She is really pretty.

2481
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:33,140
Absolutely.

2482
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:38,740
Wow, that was the worst compliment I've ever heard.

2483
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:42,220
Is that how you win the ladies over?

2484
02:28:42,620 --> 02:28:42,960
Yup.

2485
02:28:43,480 --> 02:28:45,060
Anyway, what did you find out?

2486
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:47,360
Her smile faded.

2487
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:49,840
Plenty.

2488
02:28:50,140 --> 02:28:50,540
Oh, sorry.

2489
02:28:50,680 --> 02:28:51,360
Oh, wait.

2490
02:28:51,780 --> 02:28:52,360
Oh, that was her.

2491
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:54,300
That was him saying, what did you find out?

2492
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:54,920
Plenty.

2493
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:56,680
Only one researcher is left.

2494
02:28:57,740 --> 02:28:58,740
James Harkes.

2495
02:28:58,740 --> 02:28:59,440
A.K.A.

2496
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:00,720
Jimmy the...

2497
02:29:01,880 --> 02:29:03,540
Jimmy the Wizard.

2498
02:29:07,900 --> 02:29:10,380
Why did they give him such a nickname?

2499
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:15,680
Jimmy the Wizard.

2500
02:29:17,500 --> 02:29:20,980
Head of Metal Gear Development Team.

2501
02:29:22,140 --> 02:29:23,640
Give us Huey, man.

2502
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:25,860
Supposed to be a genius.

2503
02:29:25,860 --> 02:29:26,060
Genius.

2504
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:29,220
Get his location.

2505
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:36,900
There are barracks to the north of this building.

2506
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:41,800
Wait, so there is only one researcher left that killed everybody else off?

2507
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:43,740
He seems to be held there.

2508
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:47,500
In the barracks to the north of here.

2509
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:48,480
Got it.

2510
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:51,700
One more thing.

2511
02:29:52,780 --> 02:29:58,360
There are four mercenaries working as GILF's military consultants.

2512
02:29:58,700 --> 02:29:59,560
Oh boy.

2513
02:30:00,040 --> 02:30:01,740
I can't wait to know their names.

2514
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:02,880
Please tell me.

2515
02:30:04,660 --> 02:30:05,220
Wow!

2516
02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:06,340
Look at them!

2517
02:30:06,820 --> 02:30:07,480
Oh my god!

2518
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:08,080
Wow!

2519
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:09,240
Tall man!

2520
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:10,700
Oh, I thought...

2521
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:13,760
For a second I thought...

2522
02:30:14,260 --> 02:30:14,980
I just saw...

2523
02:30:14,980 --> 02:30:17,680
You know, I know Chris is talking, but I thought his name was Chris for a second.

2524
02:30:18,900 --> 02:30:19,940
Slasher Hawk.

2525
02:30:22,620 --> 02:30:26,100
His signature weapon is a giant boomerang.

2526
02:30:26,460 --> 02:30:27,660
Okay.

2527
02:30:30,660 --> 02:30:32,880
Marionette Owl.

2528
02:30:33,220 --> 02:30:37,960
Expert assassin and master of nocturnal combat.

2529
02:30:38,460 --> 02:30:39,100
Wow.

2530
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:43,580
Big guy.

2531
02:30:44,180 --> 02:30:45,360
Pyro Bison.

2532
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:52,100
Who practices his own scorched earth tactics with a massive flamethrower.

2533
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:59,140
These are giving absolute severe mother base names.

2534
02:31:01,860 --> 02:31:05,360
And their leader...

2535
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:07,960
Black Art Viper.

2536
02:31:10,140 --> 02:31:12,640
Black Art Viper's got some hips, man.

2537
02:31:13,480 --> 02:31:14,060
Viper.

2538
02:31:14,060 --> 02:31:15,680
Poisonous snake.

2539
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:24,670
They first appeared on the scene around two years ago.

2540
02:31:26,510 --> 02:31:31,850
Made a round of hot spots around the world before they set up in Gindra.

2541
02:31:32,130 --> 02:31:33,670
I like how it's basically...

2542
02:31:36,350 --> 02:31:43,930
It's basically prototype Gray Fox, prototype Psycho Mantis and prototype Vulcan Raven.

2543
02:31:47,430 --> 02:31:49,710
They're very, very good.

2544
02:31:51,650 --> 02:31:53,750
Rumor has it they're former U.S.

2545
02:31:53,790 --> 02:31:54,750
Special Forces.

2546
02:31:57,830 --> 02:31:58,510
American?

2547
02:32:01,390 --> 02:32:03,610
With their debut streaks.

2548
02:32:05,390 --> 02:32:07,570
That was good work in a pretty short time.

2549
02:32:09,250 --> 02:32:10,930
I tried my best.

2550
02:32:11,930 --> 02:32:13,730
Look at the abs on this suit.

2551
02:32:13,730 --> 02:32:21,370
Wow, you can really see how much it looks like the sneaking suit used in actual Metal Gear Solid.

2552
02:32:22,330 --> 02:32:24,650
Was that a good enough proof for you?

2553
02:32:26,590 --> 02:32:31,950
Let's just say, you convinced me you don't need me babysitting.

2554
02:32:32,370 --> 02:32:34,970
What else?

2555
02:32:39,150 --> 02:32:40,310
Anything wrong?

2556
02:32:43,730 --> 02:32:44,710
Yes.

2557
02:32:45,110 --> 02:32:46,150
What's wrong?

2558
02:32:47,770 --> 02:32:54,070
Like the fact that we Americans are not welcome around here.

2559
02:32:56,450 --> 02:32:57,530
Okay.

2560
02:32:59,010 --> 02:32:59,930
What?

2561
02:33:03,530 --> 02:33:03,930
Why?

2562
02:33:06,350 --> 02:33:08,810
They think that the U.S.

2563
02:33:08,830 --> 02:33:11,650
is blocking their independence.

2564
02:33:12,650 --> 02:33:15,910
No, America is the country of the free.

2565
02:33:17,690 --> 02:33:23,490
That the deployment of peacekeepers is an armed invasion to extend U.S.

2566
02:33:23,950 --> 02:33:25,730
control over Gindra.

2567
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:30,690
Well, you guys...well, they stole the Metal Gear.

2568
02:33:34,510 --> 02:33:36,230
They caused it.

2569
02:33:36,230 --> 02:33:42,310
Like they...they stole the Metal Gear first and then they sent in the peacekeepers.

2570
02:33:42,490 --> 02:33:45,210
Is that not how that worked?

2571
02:33:54,410 --> 02:33:55,490
Is that...

2572
02:33:57,250 --> 02:33:58,630
Oh, it was reverse order.

2573
02:33:58,730 --> 02:34:00,270
The peacekeepers were six months ago.

2574
02:34:01,690 --> 02:34:02,770
Okay, okay.

2575
02:34:06,410 --> 02:34:07,610
Okay, okay, okay.

2576
02:34:07,610 --> 02:34:08,410
Then...

2577
02:34:11,570 --> 02:34:15,610
I mean, well, I'm...we're already working for the U.S.

2578
02:34:15,730 --> 02:34:18,930
government who already, like, developed Metal Gear in the first place.

2579
02:34:19,010 --> 02:34:26,170
So, like, it's like...it's basically every single Metal Gear game where we...oh, gosh.

2580
02:34:26,330 --> 02:34:27,990
We're loyal to the mission anyway.

2581
02:34:34,140 --> 02:34:36,340
That's why they have such faith in the general.

2582
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:39,440
Who wants to end U.S.

2583
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:40,100
interference.

2584
02:34:40,100 --> 02:34:42,280
And win independence.

2585
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:50,020
I thought our mission was for the good of the people of this country.

2586
02:34:54,980 --> 02:34:57,100
Welcome to Metal Gear, baby.

2587
02:34:58,240 --> 02:34:58,880
Oh, Chris.

2588
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:00,020
Oh, Chris.

2589
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:05,080
Chris, she's...she's about to say...she's about to say are we the baddies right now.

2590
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:09,420
But what we're doing may be...

2591
02:35:09,420 --> 02:35:13,000
Chris, why did you join the military?

2592
02:35:13,460 --> 02:35:15,240
Oh, classic Metal Gear.

2593
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:16,740
What?

2594
02:35:18,480 --> 02:35:23,360
Well, maybe because I wanted something concrete.

2595
02:35:26,180 --> 02:35:27,280
Something concrete.

2596
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,620
Like justice or discipline.

2597
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:36,240
All the things we need to keep going.

2598
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:46,700
Chris, the only thing you need on a battlefield to keep going is the instinct to keep living.

2599
02:35:46,980 --> 02:35:47,700
Wow.

2600
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:51,000
Her sword is a tool of justice.

2601
02:35:52,140 --> 02:35:52,960
Yeah.

2602
02:35:54,460 --> 02:35:57,160
I don't want you to die.

2603
02:35:57,620 --> 02:35:57,960
Wow.

2604
02:36:01,300 --> 02:36:02,120
But...

2605
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:05,040
Think about completing the mission.

2606
02:36:06,020 --> 02:36:08,620
About going home alive first.

2607
02:36:10,780 --> 02:36:12,640
Yes, I guess so.

2608
02:36:13,880 --> 02:36:15,900
I will, for now.

2609
02:36:16,060 --> 02:36:16,540
Oh my god.

2610
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,180
Chris wants to...she's just like I give up.

2611
02:36:21,180 --> 02:36:23,200
I'm going after Harkz.

2612
02:36:23,620 --> 02:36:24,760
Jimmy the Wizard.

2613
02:36:25,740 --> 02:36:30,040
He must have some valuable information on Metal Gear.

2614
02:36:31,740 --> 02:36:35,340
Okay, I'll open the doors with my card three.

2615
02:36:35,620 --> 02:36:35,960
Yay!

2616
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:38,040
You can trail me.

2617
02:36:38,840 --> 02:36:39,100
Okay.

2618
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:41,280
Chris.

2619
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:44,520
What?

2620
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:48,520
You're going to be okay.

2621
02:36:50,340 --> 02:36:51,440
Don't worry.

2622
02:36:52,620 --> 02:36:55,760
With this outfit on, no one will spot me.

2623
02:36:57,420 --> 02:36:59,160
That's not what I meant.

2624
02:37:01,060 --> 02:37:02,800
You forgot your red hat.

2625
02:37:05,180 --> 02:37:06,060
I know.

2626
02:37:06,640 --> 02:37:07,240
Thanks.

2627
02:37:10,860 --> 02:37:11,980
Ladies first.

2628
02:37:12,580 --> 02:37:14,700
Oh my gosh, we're going to go meet the Wizard.

2629
02:37:16,780 --> 02:37:20,060
The Wizard and I.

2630
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:24,360
Oh my gosh.

2631
02:37:24,540 --> 02:37:24,840
Chris.

2632
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:25,960
Chris.

2633
02:37:26,500 --> 02:37:27,100
Chris.

2634
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:28,360
There's a person.

2635
02:37:28,540 --> 02:37:29,240
There's someone else here.

2636
02:37:29,500 --> 02:37:30,180
Oh my god, Chris.

2637
02:37:30,940 --> 02:37:31,820
There's cameras.

2638
02:37:31,820 --> 02:37:33,140
Okay Chris.

2639
02:37:33,380 --> 02:37:35,860
Oh Chris, there's two other people here.

2640
02:37:36,140 --> 02:37:37,920
Chris, stop letting in more people.

2641
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:38,840
Chris.

2642
02:37:43,470 --> 02:37:44,770
She's so chill.

2643
02:37:45,490 --> 02:37:47,930
Snake, rescue James Harkz.

2644
02:37:48,230 --> 02:37:49,630
I thought he was going to say the Wizard.

2645
02:37:49,950 --> 02:37:53,210
The chief of Metal Gear development team.

2646
02:37:54,650 --> 02:38:01,330
Harkz is held in the barracks to the north of the watchtower you're in.

2647
02:38:02,110 --> 02:38:09,810
First, follow Sergeant Jenner's lead and get to the north side of the tower.

2648
02:38:11,510 --> 02:38:12,750
More health!

2649
02:38:12,890 --> 02:38:13,470
Yippee!

2650
02:38:16,990 --> 02:38:18,570
That was close.

2651
02:38:18,730 --> 02:38:20,170
I was going to go knock this guy out.

2652
02:38:20,770 --> 02:38:24,790
In fact, I might do it if they come this way.

2653
02:38:25,130 --> 02:38:26,290
They don't come this way.

2654
02:38:26,590 --> 02:38:27,490
You got lucky, buddy.

2655
02:38:29,850 --> 02:38:34,490
I'm going to box up for the...

2656
02:38:35,890 --> 02:38:36,990
Don't come around though.

2657
02:38:37,090 --> 02:38:37,510
Okay, good.

2658
02:38:41,100 --> 02:38:41,400
What?

2659
02:38:42,140 --> 02:38:42,780
How?

2660
02:38:43,500 --> 02:38:44,440
What saw me?

2661
02:38:45,100 --> 02:38:46,100
No way.

2662
02:38:46,540 --> 02:38:47,360
Oh god.

2663
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:49,900
The camera.

2664
02:38:51,180 --> 02:38:52,200
Are you kidding me?

2665
02:38:52,480 --> 02:38:54,040
Are you kidding me right now?

2666
02:38:54,380 --> 02:38:55,100
Are you kidding me?

2667
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:56,280
Are you squidding me right now?

2668
02:38:56,920 --> 02:38:57,760
Are you squidding me?

2669
02:38:57,820 --> 02:38:59,280
The dang camera saw me.

2670
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:01,640
Okay, we're fine.

2671
02:39:04,020 --> 02:39:05,960
But the camera was off screen.

2672
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:08,500
I didn't know this game was like that.

2673
02:39:12,100 --> 02:39:14,920
Okay, this person has to get back into their positions.

2674
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:19,120
And I think I'm almost good to go now.

2675
02:39:24,910 --> 02:39:26,170
They don't come over here.

2676
02:39:26,850 --> 02:39:27,810
From what I remember, yeah.

2677
02:39:28,070 --> 02:39:28,770
They walk around.

2678
02:39:44,180 --> 02:39:45,200
That was my chance.

2679
02:39:46,140 --> 02:39:47,200
I need to go up.

2680
02:39:47,260 --> 02:39:48,280
Can you go down please?

2681
02:39:49,300 --> 02:39:49,760
Thank you.

2682
02:39:50,180 --> 02:39:50,740
Oh god.

2683
02:39:56,680 --> 02:39:59,580
Jimmy the Wizard is a reference to the 1989 Nintendo movie, The Wizard.

2684
02:40:00,040 --> 02:40:02,900
Which was basically one big Nintendo commercial and introduced the Power Glove.

2685
02:40:05,020 --> 02:40:06,380
There's lore to Jimmy.

2686
02:40:07,740 --> 02:40:08,680
Oh my god, please.

2687
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:12,180
I can't tell if this person will be able to see me or not.

2688
02:40:12,360 --> 02:40:14,840
I'm around the corner, but I don't want to risk it.

2689
02:40:14,840 --> 02:40:15,040
Okay.

2690
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:27,940
And we're gonna let it go for a bit.

2691
02:40:28,340 --> 02:40:29,540
And then we're gonna go.

2692
02:40:29,800 --> 02:40:30,740
And then we're gonna leave.

2693
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:32,180
Oh,

2694
02:40:36,120 --> 02:40:36,680
there she goes.

2695
02:40:37,340 --> 02:40:37,960
Alright, bye bye.

2696
02:40:40,920 --> 02:40:42,040
I need...

2697
02:40:42,040 --> 02:40:43,020
My fogger.

2698
02:40:45,460 --> 02:40:46,680
Are these ones also timed?

2699
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:47,980
Yep.

2700
02:40:50,540 --> 02:40:51,100
Goodbye.

2701
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:51,720
Thank you.

2702
02:40:54,660 --> 02:40:56,240
Is there other stuff in here?

2703
02:40:56,640 --> 02:40:57,120
I wonder.

2704
02:40:57,920 --> 02:40:59,660
There's kind of like a corner area.

2705
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:03,360
Disappear!

2706
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:06,040
By the power of Jimmy the Wizard, be gone!

2707
02:41:07,960 --> 02:41:09,640
I don't think that one's on a timer.

2708
02:41:11,800 --> 02:41:12,540
Okay, nevermind.

2709
02:41:25,650 --> 02:41:27,270
Invested in Jimmy the Wizard.

2710
02:41:27,930 --> 02:41:29,050
Be gone!

2711
02:41:29,050 --> 02:41:29,210
Be gone!

2712
02:41:32,500 --> 02:41:33,700
Jimmy!

2713
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:45,060
Jimmy!

2714
02:42:03,500 --> 02:42:04,880
Lucky.

2715
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:07,020
Oh, lucky lucky lucky.

2716
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:08,280
Lucky.

2717
02:42:08,680 --> 02:42:09,040
Lucky.

2718
02:42:13,220 --> 02:42:14,080
So lucky.

2719
02:42:15,820 --> 02:42:16,560
Lucky.

2720
02:42:27,360 --> 02:42:28,920
Oh, wow.

2721
02:42:30,440 --> 02:42:32,900
Lucky ducky right there.

2722
02:42:36,300 --> 02:42:38,820
Hold on, I don't know what this person is about to do.

2723
02:42:41,480 --> 02:42:42,440
They're coming down.

2724
02:42:46,110 --> 02:42:47,710
Terrible rating secured.

2725
02:42:51,270 --> 02:42:53,150
Yeah, that's how we do it, boys.

2726
02:42:54,490 --> 02:42:55,170
Yawn.

2727
02:42:55,850 --> 02:42:56,530
Okay, leave.

2728
02:42:58,330 --> 02:42:59,290
Bless you.

2729
02:42:59,690 --> 02:43:00,730
They're like, who said that?

2730
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:09,240
I hate these rooms.

2731
02:43:10,060 --> 02:43:12,580
Okay, so now we have to figure out which one...

2732
02:43:13,720 --> 02:43:16,480
is the correct one that we go through.

2733
02:43:19,100 --> 02:43:19,740
Disappear.

2734
02:43:21,220 --> 02:43:22,580
Oh my gosh, it actually worked.

2735
02:43:24,060 --> 02:43:24,700
Disappear.

2736
02:43:30,740 --> 02:43:31,380
Disappear.

2737
02:43:32,500 --> 02:43:32,980
Okay.

2738
02:43:35,660 --> 02:43:36,860
It's a maze.

2739
02:43:37,620 --> 02:43:38,700
Yes, it is.

2740
02:43:39,740 --> 02:43:41,860
Okay, they're gonna make me go all the way up, aren't they?

2741
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:43,480
Disappear.

2742
02:43:49,360 --> 02:43:50,860
I wasn't risking it.

2743
02:43:53,080 --> 02:43:54,260
One more time.

2744
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:55,240
I'll pay attention.

2745
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:56,180
I got this.

2746
02:43:56,440 --> 02:43:56,540
Go.

2747
02:43:56,540 --> 02:43:57,080
Okay.

2748
02:43:59,660 --> 02:44:00,140
Disappear.

2749
02:44:05,830 --> 02:44:06,310
No.

2750
02:44:12,730 --> 02:44:14,150
Wait, the door is up here.

2751
02:44:14,250 --> 02:44:14,630
Just kidding.

2752
02:44:16,690 --> 02:44:17,170
I'm silly.

2753
02:44:22,490 --> 02:44:24,330
Oh, this is the room without the cameras.

2754
02:44:28,910 --> 02:44:29,390
Lockstorm.

2755
02:44:29,390 --> 02:44:29,590
Lockstorm.

2756
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:48,860
Is this a person or...

2757
02:44:48,860 --> 02:44:49,880
A chaff grenade!

2758
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:56,380
Is this a person here or a camera?

2759
02:44:57,020 --> 02:44:57,620
Oh, it's a camera.

2760
02:44:57,760 --> 02:44:57,900
Okay.

2761
02:44:58,680 --> 02:44:59,380
That's fine.

2762
02:44:59,440 --> 02:44:59,880
That's fine.

2763
02:44:59,980 --> 02:45:00,380
Good to know.

2764
02:45:02,120 --> 02:45:04,380
I'm not gonna waste my chaff.

2765
02:45:04,480 --> 02:45:08,500
Well, I don't wanna say waste, but I don't wanna use it right now because...

2766
02:45:08,500 --> 02:45:11,720
this room isn't actually so difficult to get out of, it seems.

2767
02:45:12,720 --> 02:45:14,580
Just have to be a little bit patient.

2768
02:45:16,540 --> 02:45:19,340
And I am a patient soul.

2769
02:45:22,240 --> 02:45:23,280
Oh my god.

2770
02:45:24,500 --> 02:45:25,260
That was close.

2771
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:27,480
No.

2772
02:45:29,180 --> 02:45:29,780
No.

2773
02:45:30,420 --> 02:45:30,720
No!

2774
02:45:37,460 --> 02:45:38,680
Don't do this to me.

2775
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:54,900
I think there's a place to hide before they come back around.

2776
02:45:57,420 --> 02:45:58,960
Almost positive there is.

2777
02:46:03,500 --> 02:46:04,760
Might be tight though.

2778
02:46:06,380 --> 02:46:08,400
I was ready to break.

2779
02:46:09,400 --> 02:46:09,880
Okay.

2780
02:46:10,420 --> 02:46:11,280
Oh gosh.

2781
02:46:15,630 --> 02:46:16,870
Wait, which way is it?

2782
02:46:16,970 --> 02:46:17,770
Is it the big circle?

2783
02:46:20,090 --> 02:46:21,430
Is it the small circle?

2784
02:46:21,690 --> 02:46:22,850
Wait, what's the small circle?

2785
02:46:23,170 --> 02:46:24,370
It's the small circle, right?

2786
02:46:24,590 --> 02:46:25,530
It's not the big circle.

2787
02:46:26,230 --> 02:46:28,810
Big circle leads to... Okay, it's the small circle.

2788
02:46:28,810 --> 02:46:29,910
Yeah, yeah.

2789
02:46:30,190 --> 02:46:31,610
It's where the red hat person is.

2790
02:46:31,650 --> 02:46:32,790
Okay, we got this.

2791
02:46:33,070 --> 02:46:33,830
Kissing inbound.

2792
02:46:34,390 --> 02:46:35,430
3, 2, 1!

2793
02:46:37,210 --> 02:46:38,070
Come on!

2794
02:46:38,990 --> 02:46:40,690
Our lips touch.

2795
02:46:48,840 --> 02:46:50,540
Uzumaki-ass map, man.

2796
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:51,420
I hate this shit.

2797
02:47:06,450 --> 02:47:09,390
If they didn't wake up so fast when I knock them out...

2798
02:47:09,390 --> 02:47:12,710
Oh, I just take... Oh god.

2799
02:47:12,950 --> 02:47:13,590
Oh my god.

2800
02:47:14,130 --> 02:47:16,950
I crawled in there so fast like a damn lizard.

2801
02:47:18,610 --> 02:47:20,190
Oh gosh, that scared me.

2802
02:47:20,390 --> 02:47:21,430
Okay, we'll just wait for her to leave.

2803
02:47:22,650 --> 02:47:24,250
I thought she was turning around.

2804
02:47:28,170 --> 02:47:29,650
Tactical smooching action.

2805
02:47:31,530 --> 02:47:32,310
Come here.

2806
02:47:32,770 --> 02:47:37,690
Oh my gosh, what if the red hats and the blue hats...

2807
02:47:38,350 --> 02:47:38,790
Rival?

2808
02:47:38,990 --> 02:47:41,430
Like they're different teams?

2809
02:47:42,610 --> 02:47:49,050
Like the blue hats are, you know, one team and they're like all fighting against each other or something?

2810
02:47:54,680 --> 02:47:55,120
Alright.

2811
02:47:58,040 --> 02:47:59,460
I'm guessing I take the elevator.

2812
02:48:08,700 --> 02:48:09,300
Red vs.

2813
02:48:09,440 --> 02:48:09,600
Blue.

2814
02:48:09,720 --> 02:48:10,800
No, there was a green hat too!

2815
02:48:11,240 --> 02:48:11,980
Red run!

2816
02:48:12,240 --> 02:48:12,900
Thank you for the hot sofa!

2817
02:48:12,900 --> 02:48:17,660
Stop by to enjoy some tactical minto espionage action and support the next MGS con!

2818
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:18,920
Looking forward to it.

2819
02:48:19,460 --> 02:48:20,620
Thank you!

2820
02:48:22,660 --> 02:48:24,700
Yeah, I appreciate it.

2821
02:48:25,940 --> 02:48:27,600
Oh yeah, and the brown hats.

2822
02:48:28,040 --> 02:48:29,160
Oh my gosh.

2823
02:48:30,840 --> 02:48:32,460
Blue here, frick the red team.

2824
02:48:32,680 --> 02:48:33,340
TF2 gamer.

2825
02:48:35,720 --> 02:48:36,840
We're going down.

2826
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:38,960
We're going down, down.

2827
02:48:39,740 --> 02:48:41,340
And we're running around.

2828
02:48:42,100 --> 02:48:44,440
And we're following after Chris.

2829
02:48:44,880 --> 02:48:46,880
She's got a nice little butt.

2830
02:48:47,740 --> 02:48:50,860
And I hope that I can get a kiss.

2831
02:48:51,740 --> 02:48:52,040
Joy!

2832
02:48:52,540 --> 02:48:53,740
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

2833
02:48:54,180 --> 02:48:55,220
Thank you so much!

2834
02:48:58,260 --> 02:48:58,780
I failed.

2835
02:48:59,100 --> 02:48:59,380
Wait.

2836
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:05,860
There wasn't like an up, was there?

2837
02:49:08,940 --> 02:49:10,720
It was only down, right?

2838
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:11,520
Or am I crazy?

2839
02:49:18,420 --> 02:49:19,760
I didn't see it.

2840
02:49:26,920 --> 02:49:27,740
Let's go up.

2841
02:49:28,020 --> 02:49:29,560
Sorry, I'm a little lost.

2842
02:49:29,820 --> 02:49:31,360
I'm a little lost ghosty.

2843
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:34,500
I'm a little lost.

2844
02:49:36,140 --> 02:49:36,920
Oh, nope.

2845
02:49:37,360 --> 02:49:38,420
There was only down.

2846
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:38,800
OK.

2847
02:49:40,360 --> 02:49:41,480
But where did she go?

2848
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:49,800
Where did she go?

2849
02:50:02,800 --> 02:50:03,580
There she is.

2850
02:50:03,740 --> 02:50:05,020
Oh, I just had to go one door over.

2851
02:50:06,100 --> 02:50:07,420
Oh, silliness.

2852
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:09,420
Oh my gosh.

2853
02:50:10,060 --> 02:50:11,380
Box, box.

2854
02:50:15,110 --> 02:50:16,550
Cardboard box on the right.

2855
02:50:20,110 --> 02:50:20,770
Alright.

2856
02:50:21,110 --> 02:50:22,070
How far do you go?

2857
02:50:32,750 --> 02:50:34,490
I don't trust it at all.

2858
02:50:34,950 --> 02:50:35,590
I'm telling you.

2859
02:50:41,440 --> 02:50:42,760
Oh no.

2860
02:50:54,820 --> 02:50:55,220
No.

2861
02:50:58,040 --> 02:50:58,440
Wait,

2862
02:51:02,150 --> 02:51:03,710
but this person didn't come over here.

2863
02:51:05,610 --> 02:51:07,190
And I think they come down, don't they?

2864
02:51:07,490 --> 02:51:08,010
Maybe not.

2865
02:51:10,510 --> 02:51:10,990
Turn around.

2866
02:51:13,630 --> 02:51:14,030
OK.

2867
02:51:14,490 --> 02:51:14,850
We're safe.

2868
02:51:17,370 --> 02:51:18,810
Honestly, Ghost Babble is really impressive.

2869
02:51:19,150 --> 02:51:20,710
Like, this is just a Game Boy Color game.

2870
02:51:20,830 --> 02:51:21,570
Not even GBA.

2871
02:51:21,730 --> 02:51:22,750
Wait, not even GBA.

2872
02:51:22,890 --> 02:51:23,930
It looks and runs great.

2873
02:51:24,030 --> 02:51:24,970
I know, right?

2874
02:51:25,110 --> 02:51:25,770
It's so great.

2875
02:51:33,330 --> 02:51:34,930
Time to frogger.

2876
02:51:35,910 --> 02:51:36,510
Fogger.

2877
02:51:38,070 --> 02:51:39,530
Not frogger.

2878
02:51:41,010 --> 02:51:43,490
OK, these ones... OK, I think I remember.

2879
02:51:44,170 --> 02:51:45,130
It was like around.

2880
02:51:47,550 --> 02:51:49,310
These ones don't turn on and off.

2881
02:51:52,490 --> 02:51:53,090
Down.

2882
02:51:55,650 --> 02:51:56,730
Do I go up?

2883
02:51:58,310 --> 02:51:58,910
Yes.

2884
02:51:59,610 --> 02:52:00,110
And over.

2885
02:52:01,990 --> 02:52:06,030
I have such, like, distrust, you know?

2886
02:52:16,980 --> 02:52:17,340
Chris!

2887
02:52:18,400 --> 02:52:18,760
Chris!

2888
02:52:21,080 --> 02:52:23,600
This is my first Metal Gear ever and I was fine.

2889
02:52:24,440 --> 02:52:26,760
I never got past the first screen so I just did VR missions.

2890
02:52:26,900 --> 02:52:27,900
VR missions are fun too.

2891
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:29,540
I actually practiced a little bit.

2892
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:30,780
Oh, I say a little bit.

2893
02:52:30,800 --> 02:52:31,560
I did the first mission.

2894
02:52:33,900 --> 02:52:34,620
Before stream.

2895
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:36,920
Thanks, thanks for the superchat.

2896
02:52:37,320 --> 02:52:38,480
Madeira, thank you for the superchat.

2897
02:52:38,780 --> 02:52:40,480
Mother Minto, I need to confess my sins.

2898
02:52:40,940 --> 02:52:42,780
As a kid, I owned this game and hated it.

2899
02:52:43,080 --> 02:52:47,600
I ended up buried in the bottom of a toy... OK, I thought you were going to say buried in your backyard.

2900
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:51,140
Like, you just got rid of it.

2901
02:52:51,180 --> 02:52:51,900
You took care of it.

2902
02:52:58,010 --> 02:53:03,950
The barracks where Hark's is kept is to the north... northeast of here.

2903
02:53:05,330 --> 02:53:06,690
Got it.

2904
02:53:06,990 --> 02:53:08,990
I'll have to head east from here.

2905
02:53:09,950 --> 02:53:11,010
And I'll be OK.

2906
02:53:12,610 --> 02:53:13,450
What about you?

2907
02:53:15,510 --> 02:53:17,990
I'll check out the power plant.

2908
02:53:18,890 --> 02:53:19,170
OK.

2909
02:53:20,050 --> 02:53:21,270
The power plant.

2910
02:53:23,850 --> 02:53:24,530
East?

2911
02:53:24,730 --> 02:53:25,650
No, east.

2912
02:53:27,170 --> 02:53:29,490
It supplies all the power for this fortress.

2913
02:53:29,750 --> 02:53:30,850
Blow it up.

2914
02:53:31,290 --> 02:53:33,730
But there's something strange going on.

2915
02:53:34,950 --> 02:53:36,950
Hmm, like what?

2916
02:53:38,790 --> 02:53:41,150
It's an important installation.

2917
02:53:42,210 --> 02:53:45,390
Sure, but there's too much traffic.

2918
02:53:45,930 --> 02:53:46,750
Wow.

2919
02:53:49,680 --> 02:53:51,860
I'm going to take a look.

2920
02:53:52,660 --> 02:53:53,480
See what's up.

2921
02:53:54,300 --> 02:53:55,440
Could be Metal Gear.

2922
02:53:57,180 --> 02:53:58,180
Chris.

2923
02:53:59,540 --> 02:54:01,220
I'll be alright.

2924
02:54:01,820 --> 02:54:02,840
Don't worry.

2925
02:54:04,220 --> 02:54:04,660
Oh.

2926
02:54:05,360 --> 02:54:07,500
I want to go that... I was going to go up that way.

2927
02:54:08,040 --> 02:54:09,080
You watch your back Snake.

2928
02:54:09,860 --> 02:54:11,220
OK, I'm going to follow you though.

2929
02:54:11,440 --> 02:54:12,120
Like for a second.

2930
02:54:12,560 --> 02:54:13,500
I just want to see what's up there.

2931
02:54:17,640 --> 02:54:19,520
Snake, leave the plant to Jenner.

2932
02:54:19,640 --> 02:54:19,920
No!

2933
02:54:20,180 --> 02:54:20,940
I want to go see!

2934
02:54:21,760 --> 02:54:24,460
And head for the barracks.

2935
02:54:25,480 --> 02:54:26,360
Head northeast.

2936
02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:27,560
You're there.

2937
02:54:28,440 --> 02:54:28,840
OK.

2938
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:30,900
No!

2939
02:54:36,690 --> 02:54:37,370
Bang.

2940
02:54:37,890 --> 02:54:38,090
Bang.

2941
02:54:41,190 --> 02:54:43,630
Is that a camera or a person?

2942
02:54:43,850 --> 02:54:44,570
That's a camera.

2943
02:54:47,690 --> 02:54:49,690
You don't come up here, right?

2944
02:54:59,220 --> 02:55:00,580
Get looked at.

2945
02:55:00,740 --> 02:55:01,660
Oh my god.

2946
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:05,160
That scared me so bad.

2947
02:55:07,240 --> 02:55:08,700
Just a box.

2948
02:55:10,060 --> 02:55:10,660
No!

2949
02:55:14,060 --> 02:55:14,700
I'm full of Russians.

2950
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:19,520
We're fine.

2951
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:20,120
Everybody?

2952
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:22,360
Northeast.

2953
02:55:22,940 --> 02:55:24,760
First we go east and then we go north.

2954
02:55:26,380 --> 02:55:27,440
That's a person.

2955
02:55:29,580 --> 02:55:30,920
The final one.

2956
02:55:30,980 --> 02:55:32,180
The last one down there.

2957
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:33,240
And then what do you do?

2958
02:55:33,680 --> 02:55:34,580
You walk.

2959
02:55:37,480 --> 02:55:38,680
And then...

2960
02:55:38,680 --> 02:55:40,160
That's it.

2961
02:55:42,440 --> 02:55:44,080
I'm late for the babbling ghost.

2962
02:55:44,180 --> 02:55:45,720
Thanks for joining, silly ass.

2963
02:55:45,820 --> 02:55:50,040
Oh, what's in here?

2964
02:55:55,820 --> 02:55:56,560
What's this?

2965
02:55:57,400 --> 02:55:58,020
Chaff grenade!

2966
02:55:59,240 --> 02:56:00,880
But my pouch... I only have three!

2967
02:56:01,220 --> 02:56:03,460
Don't be... Come on, don't be like that game.

2968
02:56:04,180 --> 02:56:05,080
Come on!

2969
02:56:06,540 --> 02:56:07,560
Come on!

2970
02:56:07,720 --> 02:56:09,000
Don't be like that game.

2971
02:56:15,470 --> 02:56:16,590
Oh no.

2972
02:56:17,270 --> 02:56:18,330
It wasn't so easy.

2973
02:56:29,220 --> 02:56:30,220
I did it.

2974
02:56:30,540 --> 02:56:31,720
It was that easy.

2975
02:56:36,940 --> 02:56:38,360
Puzzles are one weakness.

2976
02:56:41,160 --> 02:56:42,560
Who do you take me for?

2977
02:56:43,480 --> 02:56:46,180
Are these people in cages or are these people?

2978
02:56:51,240 --> 02:56:52,280
What is that?

2979
02:56:52,600 --> 02:56:53,260
Oh, it's a bird.

2980
02:56:54,320 --> 02:56:55,420
An evil bird?

2981
02:56:56,140 --> 02:56:57,800
A bird that works for the enemy?

2982
02:57:02,120 --> 02:57:03,100
Oh, a dog.

2983
02:57:03,620 --> 02:57:04,540
Oh, it's a dog.

2984
02:57:09,500 --> 02:57:10,500
I just got here.

2985
02:57:10,540 --> 02:57:11,680
Is it showing the full screen?

2986
02:57:12,220 --> 02:57:12,560
Yeah!

2987
02:57:13,360 --> 02:57:14,860
It's a Game Boy game.

2988
02:57:20,790 --> 02:57:23,170
What happens if the bird...

2989
02:57:33,510 --> 02:57:34,890
Uh oh, I angered the dogs.

2990
02:57:34,930 --> 02:57:35,330
My bad.

2991
02:57:35,850 --> 02:57:37,350
Oh no, the dogs are out!

2992
02:57:40,110 --> 02:57:41,650
Oh no, it's just more birds.

2993
02:57:41,950 --> 02:57:42,870
Oh, and a sleepy man.

2994
02:57:43,710 --> 02:57:44,670
Wait, what's in here though?

2995
02:57:45,050 --> 02:57:46,250
There's no more dogs.

2996
02:57:46,930 --> 02:57:47,650
Is there anything?

2997
02:57:48,050 --> 02:57:48,910
Anything of value?

2998
02:57:52,650 --> 02:57:54,590
This bird is going to wake this guy up for sure.

2999
02:57:55,350 --> 02:57:56,610
Don't, don't, don't... No!

3000
02:58:22,990 --> 02:58:24,950
The guy is like the princess and the pea.

3001
02:58:25,370 --> 02:58:28,290
He wakes up with the tiniest little sound.

3002
02:58:34,240 --> 02:58:35,240
Don't touch the bird.

3003
02:58:36,180 --> 02:58:37,140
And don't touch the guy.

3004
02:58:38,380 --> 02:58:39,840
Ok, we're fine.

3005
02:58:40,540 --> 02:58:41,280
Everything is good.

3006
02:58:42,800 --> 02:58:43,320
Alrighty.

3007
02:58:44,300 --> 02:58:44,560
See?

3008
02:58:44,840 --> 02:58:45,460
Easy pea.

3009
02:58:46,740 --> 02:58:48,020
No, the dogs!

3010
02:58:48,280 --> 02:58:49,880
Oh my gosh, there's so many dogs.

3011
02:58:50,400 --> 02:58:50,920
Oh god.

3012
02:58:52,260 --> 02:58:52,960
Ok.

3013
02:58:53,620 --> 02:58:54,660
What the?

3014
02:58:54,840 --> 02:58:55,200
What did I

3015
02:58:59,640 --> 02:59:00,820
do?

3016
02:59:08,380 --> 02:59:10,360
They smell my tracks?

3017
02:59:25,770 --> 02:59:27,750
They go insane.

3018
02:59:37,330 --> 02:59:39,520
Do you think they'll notice the box?

3019
02:59:39,620 --> 02:59:39,900
I wonder.

3020
02:59:39,900 --> 02:59:40,000
I wonder.

3021
02:59:48,960 --> 02:59:49,960
Oh, what's this?

3022
02:59:50,620 --> 02:59:51,360
A grenade!

3023
02:59:51,900 --> 02:59:52,680
For the dogs.

3024
02:59:55,400 --> 02:59:56,380
Oh, nevermind.

3025
02:59:57,240 --> 02:59:58,760
I guess they don't notice the box.

3026
03:00:02,360 --> 03:00:05,440
Let's go back to this.

3027
03:00:07,560 --> 03:00:08,520
Who's coming here?

3028
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:09,740
Who is it?

3029
03:00:10,740 --> 03:00:11,880
Oh, it's a regular guy.

3030
03:00:11,980 --> 03:00:12,680
A regular Joe.

3031
03:00:16,500 --> 03:00:17,040
Oh my god.

3032
03:00:18,100 --> 03:00:21,200
I'm a lonely, sickly, disabled woman in her late thirties.

3033
03:00:21,640 --> 03:00:23,220
I haven't lived my best.

3034
03:00:23,640 --> 03:00:25,740
But you give me a bright spot to look forward to most.

3035
03:00:36,480 --> 03:00:37,360
Sorry lady.

3036
03:00:38,380 --> 03:00:39,520
You stepped on my toes.

3037
03:00:42,020 --> 03:00:43,200
Thanks for being there.

3038
03:00:45,100 --> 03:00:46,100
Now be at that con.

3039
03:00:46,180 --> 03:00:47,000
Thank you!

3040
03:00:49,900 --> 03:00:51,840
Oh my god.

3041
03:00:52,140 --> 03:00:54,200
Ladyheadedspikes, thank you for the super chat.

3042
03:00:54,400 --> 03:00:55,720
Thank you for being here.

3043
03:00:56,360 --> 03:00:58,600
Glad that I can at least help a little bit.

3044
03:01:03,510 --> 03:01:04,870
That was...

3045
03:01:04,870 --> 03:01:06,950
Actually so crazy.

3046
03:01:07,690 --> 03:01:09,990
How did we survive?

3047
03:01:10,610 --> 03:01:13,930
Actual Metal Gear Survive tactics right there.

3048
03:01:14,710 --> 03:01:16,510
Shoot, this guy is so fast.

3049
03:01:21,220 --> 03:01:22,260
Too close.

3050
03:01:22,680 --> 03:01:24,600
Wait, I think so too.

3051
03:01:24,720 --> 03:01:27,500
Wait, he goes around to the side, doesn't he?

3052
03:01:27,620 --> 03:01:29,060
Oh wait, I think I messed up, guys.

3053
03:01:31,360 --> 03:01:32,880
Oh, I think I messed up.

3054
03:01:46,090 --> 03:01:46,930
Just run!

3055
03:01:48,030 --> 03:01:49,190
Just run, Psych!

3056
03:01:49,890 --> 03:01:51,470
Psychic machine, be damned!

3057
03:01:52,250 --> 03:01:52,990
Run, Psych!

3058
03:01:53,530 --> 03:01:54,990
Who cares about the stick?

3059
03:01:55,810 --> 03:01:56,530
Oh my god.

3060
03:01:57,970 --> 03:01:58,750
Oh shoot.

3061
03:01:58,750 --> 03:01:59,750
Ouch.

3062
03:02:00,270 --> 03:02:01,090
Oh my god.

3063
03:02:01,350 --> 03:02:02,010
I'm so dead.

3064
03:02:02,490 --> 03:02:03,430
I'm so dead.

3065
03:02:04,290 --> 03:02:07,310
Oh, that was a chop grenade.

3066
03:02:09,270 --> 03:02:10,430
Where is my weapon?

3067
03:02:11,210 --> 03:02:12,090
There we go.

3068
03:02:14,510 --> 03:02:15,270
There we go.

3069
03:02:15,410 --> 03:02:15,510
OK.

3070
03:02:16,710 --> 03:02:17,230
What?

3071
03:02:26,850 --> 03:02:27,570
I lived.

3072
03:02:29,490 --> 03:02:30,570
Only three months left.

3073
03:02:30,710 --> 03:02:32,190
Until what?

3074
03:02:32,810 --> 03:02:33,890
Why is it so ominous?

3075
03:02:39,240 --> 03:02:40,280
The guy.

3076
03:02:40,420 --> 03:02:41,820
Yeah, the boss weapon.

3077
03:02:42,400 --> 03:02:43,480
I didn't realize... I thought...

3078
03:02:44,440 --> 03:02:46,260
I was like, is this a boss room for a second?

3079
03:02:48,480 --> 03:02:49,420
Oh gosh.

3080
03:02:49,780 --> 03:02:50,900
Why are there so many birds?

3081
03:02:51,160 --> 03:02:53,460
Why is alerting a... Birds just fly.

3082
03:02:54,040 --> 03:02:56,900
Why is alerting the birds like a bad thing?

3083
03:02:57,200 --> 03:02:58,120
I don't understand.

3084
03:03:00,840 --> 03:03:02,180
How dumb is that?

3085
03:03:03,740 --> 03:03:04,860
Are those penguins?

3086
03:03:04,860 --> 03:03:06,860
You guys, I have...

3087
03:03:08,720 --> 03:03:10,980
I have a legit complaint, OK?

3088
03:03:11,460 --> 03:03:15,180
I'm so sick of seeing these dang Christmas commercials.

3089
03:03:16,140 --> 03:03:17,540
And they have...

3090
03:03:17,540 --> 03:03:19,520
They have penguins in them.

3091
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:22,880
Santa is from the North Pole.

3092
03:03:23,780 --> 03:03:25,560
That makes no sense.

3093
03:03:26,680 --> 03:03:28,860
Why would there be penguins...

3094
03:03:31,520 --> 03:03:34,640
In a North Pole commercial?

3095
03:03:34,840 --> 03:03:35,460
You know what I mean?

3096
03:03:37,560 --> 03:03:38,920
It's so annoying.

3097
03:03:42,540 --> 03:03:43,460
Fair point.

3098
03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:44,220
Thank you.

3099
03:03:51,710 --> 03:03:53,210
Sneak 100, real.

3100
03:03:54,490 --> 03:03:56,010
I might be John Metal Gear.

3101
03:03:56,470 --> 03:03:57,870
Oh my god, there's so many...

3102
03:03:57,870 --> 03:03:58,070
What?

3103
03:04:03,970 --> 03:04:04,970
He's spoovering.

3104
03:04:05,930 --> 03:04:06,430
Ouch.

3105
03:04:07,010 --> 03:04:08,410
No, I died!

3106
03:04:09,470 --> 03:04:11,570
I didn't have my ration equipped.

3107
03:04:14,130 --> 03:04:14,930
Where am I?

3108
03:04:14,970 --> 03:04:16,250
Oh, I start from here.

3109
03:04:16,450 --> 03:04:16,770
You know what?

3110
03:04:17,130 --> 03:04:17,630
Honestly...

3111
03:04:17,630 --> 03:04:18,050
Oh my god.

3112
03:04:18,890 --> 03:04:20,210
Mister, please, leave me alone.

3113
03:04:24,730 --> 03:04:25,790
What's over this way?

3114
03:04:27,970 --> 03:04:28,470
Instead.

3115
03:04:40,840 --> 03:04:41,980
Use my ration.

3116
03:04:42,560 --> 03:04:43,360
Grab new ration.

3117
03:04:44,240 --> 03:04:46,080
I was pretty much full on health, but whatever.

3118
03:04:46,580 --> 03:04:47,060
What's this?

3119
03:04:47,960 --> 03:04:49,020
Grenade, more grenade.

3120
03:04:54,120 --> 03:04:55,040
What's over here?

3121
03:04:56,860 --> 03:04:57,800
More stuff.

3122
03:04:59,460 --> 03:05:03,980
But yeah, I saw like a Target commercial today and it just made me so mad.

3123
03:05:04,440 --> 03:05:07,100
Because it was like, it showed the penguins...

3124
03:05:07,100 --> 03:05:11,220
And then it showed a polar bear like 2 seconds afterwards.

3125
03:05:11,220 --> 03:05:12,840
I was like, no, this is...

3126
03:05:12,840 --> 03:05:15,360
This is just stupid.

3127
03:05:15,780 --> 03:05:16,780
This is just dumb.

3128
03:05:21,520 --> 03:05:23,040
Do you think they'll catch me in here?

3129
03:05:27,160 --> 03:05:28,320
Oh, come on.

3130
03:05:28,580 --> 03:05:29,360
No way.

3131
03:05:30,260 --> 03:05:30,760
More grenade!

3132
03:05:32,380 --> 03:05:33,500
Leave me alone!

3133
03:05:33,940 --> 03:05:34,620
Stupid dogs!

3134
03:05:36,480 --> 03:05:38,100
Gosh, these dogs hit.

3135
03:05:38,920 --> 03:05:39,860
They hit!

3136
03:05:46,230 --> 03:05:47,250
Thank god.

3137
03:05:47,750 --> 03:05:48,170
No!

3138
03:05:48,430 --> 03:05:48,610
No!

3139
03:05:49,010 --> 03:05:49,390
No!

3140
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:13,840
Stop!

3141
03:06:15,200 --> 03:06:15,840
Boomerang!

3142
03:06:17,220 --> 03:06:17,860
Die.

3143
03:06:21,940 --> 03:06:22,600
I'm gonna die.

3144
03:06:22,920 --> 03:06:23,600
I'm gonna die.

3145
03:06:25,880 --> 03:06:26,860
Maybe, you know what?

3146
03:06:26,880 --> 03:06:28,280
I'm just gonna try again, honestly.

3147
03:06:28,480 --> 03:06:29,040
Just kill me.

3148
03:06:29,880 --> 03:06:30,460
There we go.

3149
03:06:32,400 --> 03:06:34,860
Because I'll see where it brings me back.

3150
03:06:42,080 --> 03:06:44,000
Oh, not great.

3151
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:45,520
Did I at least press the button?

3152
03:06:46,200 --> 03:06:46,400
Okay.

3153
03:06:46,860 --> 03:06:49,680
Imagine if I had gone and I forgot to pre-press the button.

3154
03:06:52,800 --> 03:06:54,240
That's so cruel.

3155
03:06:54,900 --> 03:06:56,320
I hate the dogs.

3156
03:06:57,580 --> 03:07:00,650
They can sniff me.

3157
03:07:03,590 --> 03:07:05,650
I'm so far, so mean.

3158
03:07:16,270 --> 03:07:17,130
Go away!

3159
03:07:17,250 --> 03:07:17,890
Stop camping!

3160
03:07:19,070 --> 03:07:19,970
Okay, hold on.

3161
03:07:21,530 --> 03:07:22,350
Sniffer, sniffer.

3162
03:07:22,350 --> 03:07:23,870
Sniffer, sniffer.

3163
03:07:25,070 --> 03:07:26,710
Who's throwing that boomerang?

3164
03:07:26,790 --> 03:07:27,830
An eventual boss.

3165
03:07:29,230 --> 03:07:30,990
An eventual boss guy.

3166
03:07:32,310 --> 03:07:33,230
Okay, hold on.

3167
03:07:34,130 --> 03:07:38,450
I have to be a little strategic about this, I think.

3168
03:07:39,630 --> 03:07:40,370
Oh, okay.

3169
03:07:40,530 --> 03:07:40,890
Nice.

3170
03:07:41,350 --> 03:07:42,030
Nice, nice, nice.

3171
03:07:45,570 --> 03:07:47,770
Maybe I should have saved that ration.

3172
03:07:51,050 --> 03:07:53,490
Maybe I should have saved that ration, huh?

3173
03:07:54,810 --> 03:07:56,150
Maybe I was a fool.

3174
03:08:03,340 --> 03:08:05,080
Maybe I was a big ol' dummy idiot.

3175
03:08:06,120 --> 03:08:06,920
Leave me alone!

3176
03:08:12,840 --> 03:08:14,580
Which way did I go before?

3177
03:08:16,860 --> 03:08:18,420
I wonder if I can go this way.

3178
03:08:20,240 --> 03:08:21,900
Or if it's gonna alert the bird.

3179
03:08:23,220 --> 03:08:24,320
I hate this.

3180
03:08:24,320 --> 03:08:25,940
Thank god, okay.

3181
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:31,520
Truly a baka.

3182
03:08:40,810 --> 03:08:42,290
Just a box.

3183
03:08:42,590 --> 03:08:47,350
Alright, we'll go the same way we did before.

3184
03:08:49,150 --> 03:08:50,750
Long way it is, yeah.

3185
03:08:52,050 --> 03:08:55,290
Seems to be the better way.

3186
03:08:56,150 --> 03:08:57,050
I guess.

3187
03:09:04,850 --> 03:09:07,710
I did it so smoothly before.

3188
03:09:08,610 --> 03:09:10,850
I don't know if I'll be able to...

3189
03:09:13,840 --> 03:09:14,560
Just kidding.

3190
03:09:14,740 --> 03:09:17,120
I was able to do it just as smoothly as before.

3191
03:09:28,190 --> 03:09:28,990
Oh my god.

3192
03:09:29,310 --> 03:09:29,550
Yay!

3193
03:09:36,880 --> 03:09:37,340
Grenade.

3194
03:09:38,280 --> 03:09:40,040
Actually, I am gonna use this one.

3195
03:09:42,320 --> 03:09:43,340
Wait, wrong thing.

3196
03:09:46,280 --> 03:09:46,840
Grab.

3197
03:09:46,920 --> 03:09:47,080
No.

3198
03:09:47,320 --> 03:09:47,660
Ration.

3199
03:09:48,280 --> 03:09:49,140
What are these?

3200
03:09:49,960 --> 03:09:50,520
Grenades.

3201
03:09:51,240 --> 03:09:51,800
Grenades.

3202
03:09:52,220 --> 03:09:54,060
Am I supposed to use the grenades against the dogs?

3203
03:09:54,340 --> 03:09:54,500
I don't know.

3204
03:09:56,900 --> 03:09:57,760
Here he is!

3205
03:09:58,040 --> 03:10:00,600
Oh no, I think I'm supposed to use the grenades against him!

3206
03:10:01,680 --> 03:10:02,800
Solid Snake!

3207
03:10:04,760 --> 03:10:05,580
Who's there?

3208
03:10:07,260 --> 03:10:07,820
No!

3209
03:10:08,220 --> 03:10:09,400
Oh my god, Vulcan Raven!

3210
03:10:09,740 --> 03:10:10,640
Not really.

3211
03:10:11,580 --> 03:10:12,220
Hawk.

3212
03:10:12,520 --> 03:10:14,400
I am Slasher Hawk.

3213
03:10:14,520 --> 03:10:18,040
He looks like... He looks like he's from He-Man or something.

3214
03:10:18,880 --> 03:10:19,940
Oh my god.

3215
03:10:20,480 --> 03:10:22,240
He looks so crazy.

3216
03:10:22,560 --> 03:10:22,700
No!

3217
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:23,080
No!

3218
03:10:23,420 --> 03:10:24,060
Thundercats!

3219
03:10:24,360 --> 03:10:25,780
He looks like Thundercats!

3220
03:10:27,480 --> 03:10:29,360
He's got the hair and everything.

3221
03:10:32,320 --> 03:10:36,480
One of the mercenaries that decimated Delta... Delta Force.

3222
03:10:38,960 --> 03:10:39,960
That's right!

3223
03:10:40,300 --> 03:10:42,580
A boring little clean up job.

3224
03:10:44,200 --> 03:10:48,560
I've had it with these mother effing penguins and this mother effing Christmas commercial.

3225
03:10:49,440 --> 03:10:50,240
That's truly mean.

3226
03:10:52,360 --> 03:10:53,960
Hopefully we only need to fight him once.

3227
03:10:54,120 --> 03:10:55,700
Why do you say it like that Nexie?

3228
03:10:56,320 --> 03:10:57,500
Why do you say it like that?

3229
03:10:57,780 --> 03:10:58,500
Lion-O!

3230
03:10:58,620 --> 03:10:58,920
Yes!

3231
03:10:59,000 --> 03:10:59,180
Yes!

3232
03:10:59,280 --> 03:10:59,540
Yes!

3233
03:11:00,100 --> 03:11:01,580
How do you know my name?

3234
03:11:03,480 --> 03:11:05,680
Your reputation precedes you.

3235
03:11:05,680 --> 03:11:08,120
Solid Snake.

3236
03:11:08,320 --> 03:11:13,560
It's a very special name to us, the Black Chamber.

3237
03:11:15,220 --> 03:11:16,640
Black Chamber.

3238
03:11:18,340 --> 03:11:27,740
Unlike the pawns here, we have no interest in the general's ideals or bid for independence.

3239
03:11:28,700 --> 03:11:30,920
Otherwise it will be Hawk too.

3240
03:11:31,560 --> 03:11:32,300
Oh come on.

3241
03:11:32,380 --> 03:11:32,680
Stop!

3242
03:11:36,460 --> 03:11:39,120
But let me... Oh my gosh, I saw a video the other day.

3243
03:11:39,400 --> 03:11:42,420
I guess when like... You know the company Peloton?

3244
03:11:42,940 --> 03:11:52,560
They do like the stationary bikes and you have the Peloton classes and stuff like that.

3245
03:11:55,120 --> 03:11:56,660
There was a compilation.

3246
03:11:56,940 --> 03:12:03,840
Apparently, I guess if you join their online classes, they'll read out your username or something.

3247
03:12:05,160 --> 03:12:07,140
It's like a stream or something.

3248
03:12:07,880 --> 03:12:21,780
And I just saw a compilation of them reading out stupid names like the Hawk Tua and the Huge Anus and stuff like that.

3249
03:12:26,240 --> 03:12:28,800
And it was just a full compilation.

3250
03:12:29,840 --> 03:12:32,440
And I was like hearing ones that I've never even heard before.

3251
03:12:32,440 --> 03:12:35,420
You guys have to step up your game.

3252
03:12:37,540 --> 03:12:38,760
But let me tell you this.

3253
03:12:39,400 --> 03:12:46,100
Black Chamber, not Foxhound, is the world's best special forces unit.

3254
03:12:50,460 --> 03:12:53,060
And I'll prove it with your dead body.

3255
03:12:53,620 --> 03:12:54,100
Oh boy.

3256
03:12:54,340 --> 03:12:54,920
OK here we go.

3257
03:12:54,980 --> 03:12:55,780
First boss fight.

3258
03:12:59,810 --> 03:13:00,650
Take this!

3259
03:13:04,190 --> 03:13:05,050
A boomerang.

3260
03:13:05,170 --> 03:13:06,750
Yeah, we heard about this in the codec.

3261
03:13:07,190 --> 03:13:09,250
Is the bird going to attack us too?

3262
03:13:09,510 --> 03:13:10,850
Because that's kind of messed up.

3263
03:13:12,470 --> 03:13:16,770
That's an overused white man's name.

3264
03:13:17,690 --> 03:13:19,440
My people call it...

3265
03:13:28,130 --> 03:13:30,910
This is a weapon of proud lineage.

3266
03:13:32,530 --> 03:13:36,450
And it's your guide into the afterlife.

3267
03:13:38,450 --> 03:13:39,930
Boomerang Bobby.

3268
03:13:40,210 --> 03:13:41,990
No, it's not a boomerang.

3269
03:13:43,730 --> 03:13:48,190
Outer Heaven is what you're remembered for.

3270
03:13:48,630 --> 03:13:52,690
And Outer Heaven is where you'll be buried.

3271
03:13:52,930 --> 03:13:55,010
That was hard actually.

3272
03:13:56,210 --> 03:13:57,570
Start digging!

3273
03:13:57,570 --> 03:13:57,870
DIGGING!

3274
03:13:59,870 --> 03:14:00,970
Oh my gosh.

3275
03:14:01,030 --> 03:14:01,230
Ouch.

3276
03:14:09,130 --> 03:14:10,450
I'm not even hitting him.

3277
03:14:13,270 --> 03:14:15,310
I think I have to... Hold on.

3278
03:14:15,410 --> 03:14:15,690
I think I

3279
03:14:24,260 --> 03:14:25,160
have...

3280
03:14:25,160 --> 03:14:25,740
There we go.

3281
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:27,860
And... that.

3282
03:14:28,020 --> 03:14:28,160
OK.

3283
03:14:28,540 --> 03:14:28,980
Grenades.

3284
03:14:29,060 --> 03:14:29,880
He's up on a hill.

3285
03:14:30,160 --> 03:14:30,960
I see.

3286
03:14:32,020 --> 03:14:32,320
OK.

3287
03:14:32,400 --> 03:14:33,880
How do I use the... Oh wait.

3288
03:14:34,020 --> 03:14:35,120
I selected this.

3289
03:14:35,300 --> 03:14:35,680
I'm an idiot.

3290
03:14:35,800 --> 03:14:36,160
Sorry guys.

3291
03:14:37,840 --> 03:14:38,300
Oh, grenades.

3292
03:14:38,300 --> 03:14:38,480
Grenades.

3293
03:14:40,460 --> 03:14:41,180
Inflicts damage.

3294
03:14:41,300 --> 03:14:41,780
B to throw.

3295
03:14:43,080 --> 03:14:43,840
Oh, nevermind.

3296
03:14:49,400 --> 03:14:51,320
He has so much more health than me.

3297
03:14:54,360 --> 03:14:55,100
Oh my god.

3298
03:14:55,220 --> 03:14:56,340
This does big damage.

3299
03:14:56,520 --> 03:14:57,160
Holy shit.

3300
03:14:59,760 --> 03:15:00,800
Keep throwing these ones.

3301
03:15:00,860 --> 03:15:01,860
They're easier to dodge please.

3302
03:15:02,060 --> 03:15:02,360
Thank you.

3303
03:15:16,160 --> 03:15:17,100
What just happened?

3304
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:20,000
What just happened?

3305
03:15:21,080 --> 03:15:22,980
This hawk is my totem.

3306
03:15:23,660 --> 03:15:24,960
And my protector.

3307
03:15:25,100 --> 03:15:26,260
God, he really is just...

3308
03:15:26,860 --> 03:15:28,020
Prototype Vulcan Raven.

3309
03:15:29,760 --> 03:15:33,360
As long as it flies, I will fight.

3310
03:15:34,160 --> 03:15:34,460
Go!

3311
03:15:36,280 --> 03:15:36,840
No!

3312
03:15:36,940 --> 03:15:37,280
Bird!

3313
03:15:37,420 --> 03:15:38,300
Please leave me alone.

3314
03:15:38,960 --> 03:15:39,460
Oh my god.

3315
03:15:39,540 --> 03:15:40,980
Now I have to fight the bird too?

3316
03:15:40,980 --> 03:15:41,020
No!

3317
03:15:44,040 --> 03:15:44,940
Leave me alone!

3318
03:15:54,010 --> 03:15:54,530
Ouch!

3319
03:15:54,870 --> 03:15:56,290
Ouch, ouch.

3320
03:15:59,130 --> 03:16:02,010
Oh my god.

3321
03:16:04,810 --> 03:16:06,090
We're getting him?

3322
03:16:16,520 --> 03:16:17,040
Nice.

3323
03:16:23,750 --> 03:16:27,490
This game is gonna lower my self-esteem, which I didn't even think was possible.

3324
03:16:27,490 --> 03:16:32,490
I didn't think it was possible to go any lower, but...

3325
03:16:33,250 --> 03:16:34,590
So sad.

3326
03:16:35,990 --> 03:16:38,310
Oh wow, we get death scenes too?

3327
03:16:38,510 --> 03:16:39,750
Wow, this is so awesome.

3328
03:16:41,190 --> 03:16:43,050
Hawk, why me?

3329
03:16:44,730 --> 03:16:49,610
You, all of you, took away my family.

3330
03:16:50,930 --> 03:16:51,810
The birds.

3331
03:16:53,730 --> 03:16:56,170
Terrible is maybe the funniest rank I've ever seen.

3332
03:16:59,590 --> 03:17:01,670
What are you talking about?

3333
03:17:08,160 --> 03:17:10,440
I grew up in Australia.

3334
03:17:12,740 --> 03:17:14,060
Nice, you beat him.

3335
03:17:14,240 --> 03:17:15,200
And the hawk too.

3336
03:17:17,880 --> 03:17:20,360
Oh my gosh, that's so funny.

3337
03:17:21,420 --> 03:17:23,260
But that's what a vampire would say.

3338
03:17:23,260 --> 03:17:24,660
You beat him.

3339
03:17:25,060 --> 03:17:26,260
Hawk too, bleh.

3340
03:17:40,500 --> 03:17:41,400
You get it?

3341
03:17:41,480 --> 03:17:42,440
Bleh, bleh.

3342
03:17:42,700 --> 03:17:43,740
Hawk too, bleh.

3343
03:17:45,780 --> 03:17:46,880
He's dying, don't choke.

3344
03:17:46,960 --> 03:17:47,380
Sorry, sorry.

3345
03:17:48,200 --> 03:17:49,540
What the people you call...

3346
03:17:51,080 --> 03:17:52,120
Oh, aborigines.

3347
03:17:53,660 --> 03:17:57,700
But that's not what I was born as.

3348
03:17:58,360 --> 03:18:00,980
Oh my god, he kinda looks so scary though with his eyes.

3349
03:18:01,540 --> 03:18:02,280
I was abandoned.

3350
03:18:03,800 --> 03:18:07,120
Parents took me in, raised me against...

3351
03:18:08,920 --> 03:18:10,860
The elders' opposition.

3352
03:18:12,840 --> 03:18:13,580
So cold.

3353
03:18:14,140 --> 03:18:17,420
Everyone was always so cold to me.

3354
03:18:18,620 --> 03:18:23,280
I'd go where the talking and laughter was.

3355
03:18:24,060 --> 03:18:25,700
And they'd scatter.

3356
03:18:27,020 --> 03:18:29,060
That's what you guys do.

3357
03:18:30,540 --> 03:18:32,580
I come back and you all say scatter.

3358
03:18:35,220 --> 03:18:37,640
Leave me with the ashes.

3359
03:18:39,100 --> 03:18:39,940
I tried.

3360
03:18:40,460 --> 03:18:42,440
I observed the customs.

3361
03:18:43,720 --> 03:18:44,720
The taboos.

3362
03:18:45,630 --> 03:18:47,180
More than anyone else.

3363
03:18:48,460 --> 03:18:50,740
I tried to win their acceptance.

3364
03:18:52,460 --> 03:18:54,720
But when my parents died...

3365
03:18:55,320 --> 03:18:56,740
They turned me.

3366
03:18:57,200 --> 03:18:58,460
They turned me out.

3367
03:18:59,300 --> 03:19:01,780
Wouldn't let me be one of them.

3368
03:19:08,240 --> 03:19:11,830
From then on, I drifted all over the world.

3369
03:19:13,770 --> 03:19:15,570
Notorious BSV, happy birthday!

3370
03:19:15,910 --> 03:19:17,710
Give me one second after this, I'll sing you.

3371
03:19:20,010 --> 03:19:23,570
And everywhere I went, I was an outsider.

3372
03:19:23,710 --> 03:19:25,130
Thank you so much for the pink superchat!

3373
03:19:26,050 --> 03:19:27,170
No one accepted me.

3374
03:19:28,490 --> 03:19:30,170
But Viper was different.

3375
03:19:31,290 --> 03:19:32,370
He took me in.

3376
03:19:33,090 --> 03:19:35,930
Accepted me into the black chamber.

3377
03:19:37,410 --> 03:19:39,450
It was my home and...

3378
03:19:40,390 --> 03:19:40,710
You!

3379
03:19:41,210 --> 03:19:42,210
All of you!

3380
03:19:44,250 --> 03:19:44,950
What?

3381
03:19:45,470 --> 03:19:48,270
I'll be dead.

3382
03:19:48,910 --> 03:19:49,950
But Viper...

3383
03:19:50,890 --> 03:19:53,570
I know that Viper...

3384
03:19:53,570 --> 03:19:55,010
Will avenge me.

3385
03:19:58,650 --> 03:19:59,630
Taste it.

3386
03:19:59,990 --> 03:20:00,950
Our bitterness.

3387
03:20:01,670 --> 03:20:02,630
Our grief.

3388
03:20:06,820 --> 03:20:09,000
No funeral pyre, Snake.

3389
03:20:10,080 --> 03:20:11,120
It's forbidden.

3390
03:20:13,080 --> 03:20:16,560
This hawk will carry my spirit home.

3391
03:20:17,560 --> 03:20:20,300
This is just Metal Gear, man.

3392
03:20:20,820 --> 03:20:22,220
This is just Metal Gear Solid.

3393
03:20:24,020 --> 03:20:24,700
Yes.

3394
03:20:25,360 --> 03:20:26,280
Finally.

3395
03:20:26,940 --> 03:20:27,920
Going home.

3396
03:20:30,620 --> 03:20:32,000
Will they...

3397
03:20:32,460 --> 03:20:33,880
Let me in?

3398
03:20:34,640 --> 03:20:35,600
This time?

3399
03:20:36,060 --> 03:20:37,720
It's so sad.

3400
03:20:42,020 --> 03:20:43,580
Written by Fukushima?

3401
03:20:43,800 --> 03:20:45,460
Wait, actually...

3402
03:20:45,460 --> 03:20:46,100
As expected.

3403
03:20:54,300 --> 03:20:55,340
I'm really sorry, Hawk.

3404
03:20:58,800 --> 03:20:59,600
Hold on.

3405
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:03,260
I'm trying to get to a spot where...

3406
03:21:04,260 --> 03:21:05,160
I can sing happy birthday.

3407
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:19,400
Nice.

3408
03:21:20,400 --> 03:21:21,140
Nice.

3409
03:21:22,380 --> 03:21:23,540
Alrighty.

3410
03:21:26,200 --> 03:21:28,500
Happy birthday to you.

3411
03:21:29,160 --> 03:21:31,680
Happy birthday to you.

3412
03:21:32,340 --> 03:21:35,580
Happy birthday Notorious B.S.G.

3413
03:21:37,080 --> 03:21:40,720
Happy birthday to you.

3414
03:21:43,020 --> 03:21:44,120
Happy birthday!

3415
03:21:44,120 --> 03:21:44,340
Yay!

3416
03:21:46,080 --> 03:21:49,040
This is where we learn his hawk's name is Tua.

3417
03:21:49,560 --> 03:21:53,140
I wish we could go back to the times when Hawk came after Mike.

3418
03:21:54,900 --> 03:21:57,560
Why can't we go back to those simpler times?

3419
03:21:58,400 --> 03:21:59,460
When Hawk...

3420
03:21:59,460 --> 03:22:01,200
This is an elevator.

3421
03:22:03,200 --> 03:22:04,900
When after Hawk...

3422
03:22:04,900 --> 03:22:07,280
Wait, when after Mike came Hawk.

3423
03:22:08,340 --> 03:22:08,720
You know?

3424
03:22:09,440 --> 03:22:10,120
Oh.

3425
03:22:11,580 --> 03:22:13,440
This is why we explore, everybody.

3426
03:22:14,320 --> 03:22:15,440
Simpler times.

3427
03:22:18,400 --> 03:22:19,500
What is this?

3428
03:22:21,240 --> 03:22:22,300
I'm afraid to touch it.

3429
03:22:25,540 --> 03:22:27,200
You think I can touch it?

3430
03:22:29,460 --> 03:22:30,400
That's fine.

3431
03:22:37,200 --> 03:22:38,660
Stop being tired and go.

3432
03:22:40,060 --> 03:22:41,160
Keep patrolling.

3433
03:22:41,660 --> 03:22:42,140
Okay,

3434
03:22:46,820 --> 03:22:47,640
what's on the other side?

3435
03:22:50,060 --> 03:22:52,280
Why didn't she give us her level 3 card?

3436
03:22:52,480 --> 03:22:53,940
It's kind of messed up, isn't it?

3437
03:22:56,620 --> 03:23:00,000
I have a feeling someone is going to come over here.

3438
03:23:06,120 --> 03:23:07,080
Mike Tua.

3439
03:23:07,080 --> 03:23:07,500
No.

3440
03:23:10,940 --> 03:23:11,540
I

3441
03:23:38,160 --> 03:23:39,000
can't tell.

3442
03:23:39,120 --> 03:23:41,020
I'm seeing what the other person's route is too.

3443
03:23:45,320 --> 03:23:46,540
It's hard to tell.

3444
03:23:47,520 --> 03:23:48,480
I think I can go here.

3445
03:23:49,040 --> 03:23:50,280
Oh, it's not a person.

3446
03:23:52,080 --> 03:23:53,540
That would explain it.

3447
03:23:56,740 --> 03:23:59,380
That would explain it.

3448
03:24:00,220 --> 03:24:01,780
Okay, nice.

3449
03:24:03,780 --> 03:24:04,840
Please let me in.

3450
03:24:05,320 --> 03:24:06,380
Please let me in.

3451
03:24:08,780 --> 03:24:09,320
Nevermind.

3452
03:24:11,600 --> 03:24:15,640
I think I have to go get the level 3 card.

3453
03:24:18,080 --> 03:24:19,760
Probably in that other side.

3454
03:24:19,980 --> 03:24:21,620
Or upstairs or something.

3455
03:24:24,040 --> 03:24:28,580
This wouldn't be a problem if Chris had not been so selfish.

3456
03:24:29,380 --> 03:24:33,360
I don't think she needs the level 3 card at the power plant.

3457
03:24:33,440 --> 03:24:34,020
I'm just saying.

3458
03:24:34,980 --> 03:24:35,980
Oh my god, I'm stuck here.

3459
03:24:37,640 --> 03:24:38,760
Remember the chaff.

3460
03:24:45,400 --> 03:24:46,280
Actually, wait.

3461
03:24:46,640 --> 03:24:47,580
I think this was a mistake.

3462
03:24:48,700 --> 03:24:51,900
Okay, nevermind.

3463
03:24:52,240 --> 03:24:52,540
I'm good.

3464
03:24:58,880 --> 03:25:00,840
Alright, let's go knock this guy out.

3465
03:25:19,290 --> 03:25:20,610
That's not a card.

3466
03:25:24,650 --> 03:25:26,030
Okay, got it.

3467
03:25:27,930 --> 03:25:28,490
Oh,

3468
03:25:33,880 --> 03:25:35,020
I forgot this kills him.

3469
03:25:35,620 --> 03:25:36,800
I got terrible ranking.

3470
03:25:41,560 --> 03:25:45,060
Gosh, he has such a weak skull.

3471
03:25:45,160 --> 03:25:45,860
He's like a baby.

3472
03:25:48,680 --> 03:25:50,500
He has such a weak skull.

3473
03:26:01,410 --> 03:26:02,530
I'm sorry.

3474
03:26:18,480 --> 03:26:19,900
What's this guy gonna do?

3475
03:26:24,160 --> 03:26:25,640
I can't tell at all.

3476
03:26:26,380 --> 03:26:27,900
Okay, he's going down that way.

3477
03:26:29,860 --> 03:26:31,220
I can box here.

3478
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:34,880
I believe.

3479
03:26:35,740 --> 03:26:36,480
Is he gonna go up?

3480
03:26:39,560 --> 03:26:42,000
Are you gonna finish this entire game tonight, Rinto?

3481
03:26:42,140 --> 03:26:43,320
It's not very long, so...

3482
03:26:44,220 --> 03:26:46,560
I'm going to attempt to do that, yeah.

3483
03:26:50,060 --> 03:26:51,300
There will be an attempt.

3484
03:26:57,350 --> 03:26:58,770
Keep patrolling, mister.

3485
03:26:59,250 --> 03:27:00,990
There could be a bad guy.

3486
03:27:01,410 --> 03:27:02,690
There could be an intruder.

3487
03:27:03,450 --> 03:27:05,250
At any moment.

3488
03:27:06,550 --> 03:27:08,990
It's so annoying having to switch the card keys though.

3489
03:27:09,390 --> 03:27:10,450
No, are you serious?

3490
03:27:12,090 --> 03:27:12,530
Okay.

3491
03:27:38,220 --> 03:27:39,480
Up we go.

3492
03:27:41,700 --> 03:27:43,080
Boxed and ready.

3493
03:27:45,880 --> 03:27:47,200
Well, I guess we didn't...

3494
03:27:47,200 --> 03:27:50,080
Oh no, the noisy floors.

3495
03:27:50,080 --> 03:27:50,300
The noisy floors.

3496
03:27:53,820 --> 03:27:55,280
Beware the noisy floor.

3497
03:27:57,260 --> 03:27:58,180
Just a box.

3498
03:27:59,580 --> 03:28:01,360
Just a box.

3499
03:28:02,840 --> 03:28:04,040
Just a box.

3500
03:28:06,600 --> 03:28:07,820
Stun grenade.

3501
03:28:08,200 --> 03:28:08,700
Nice.

3502
03:28:13,730 --> 03:28:15,910
I think this is also a... yeah.

3503
03:28:18,390 --> 03:28:19,650
Security camera.

3504
03:28:20,290 --> 03:28:22,270
Which way shall we go?

3505
03:28:23,290 --> 03:28:25,050
Go this way.

3506
03:28:25,690 --> 03:28:26,350
Why not?

3507
03:28:28,250 --> 03:28:29,630
Oh, noisy floor.

3508
03:28:38,690 --> 03:28:40,770
Sneaky sneaky.

3509
03:28:46,720 --> 03:28:48,840
Sneak around you.

3510
03:28:50,260 --> 03:28:52,020
I'll take your ammo.

3511
03:28:53,460 --> 03:28:55,660
And I'll go down.

3512
03:28:56,580 --> 03:28:58,500
There's nothing here.

3513
03:28:59,500 --> 03:29:01,460
Okay, let's go.

3514
03:29:03,260 --> 03:29:05,500
Let's leave this place.

3515
03:29:06,780 --> 03:29:09,180
Sneak sneak sneak.

3516
03:29:09,800 --> 03:29:11,540
Sneaky sneaky.

3517
03:29:14,080 --> 03:29:15,940
There we go.

3518
03:29:18,300 --> 03:29:19,860
Alright, back to box.

3519
03:29:29,350 --> 03:29:32,910
I think there was a door right down here as well.

3520
03:29:32,910 --> 03:29:36,350
So we shall go investigate.

3521
03:29:38,370 --> 03:29:40,870
The cameras are so slow.

3522
03:29:41,910 --> 03:29:42,950
Which I guess is a good thing.

3523
03:29:43,350 --> 03:29:45,130
But also a frustrating thing.

3524
03:29:57,480 --> 03:29:58,820
Another maze room.

3525
03:29:59,760 --> 03:30:00,860
Some more stun grenades.

3526
03:30:01,860 --> 03:30:02,820
We love to see it.

3527
03:30:07,560 --> 03:30:08,220
Uzumaki.

3528
03:30:13,020 --> 03:30:15,260
Game has been surprisingly good so far.

3529
03:30:15,260 --> 03:30:21,380
Yeah, a lot of people have always really praised Ghost Bevel.

3530
03:30:31,820 --> 03:30:33,300
What is the point?

3531
03:30:33,860 --> 03:30:34,240
What?

3532
03:30:35,520 --> 03:30:36,320
What?

3533
03:30:37,140 --> 03:30:38,560
There's nothing here.

3534
03:30:38,980 --> 03:30:41,120
What is the point of these red...

3535
03:30:43,180 --> 03:30:44,900
These red areas.

3536
03:30:46,260 --> 03:30:46,620
Ah,

3537
03:30:55,300 --> 03:30:56,840
it's a fast travel area.

3538
03:30:57,120 --> 03:30:57,860
Loading gates.

3539
03:30:57,940 --> 03:31:00,480
Okay, that's what I thought it might be.

3540
03:31:04,240 --> 03:31:04,600
But...

3541
03:31:10,000 --> 03:31:11,780
Is this guy coming down or what?

3542
03:31:13,060 --> 03:31:13,900
Maybe I have time.

3543
03:31:14,120 --> 03:31:14,520
Nope, I

3544
03:31:21,460 --> 03:31:22,140
don't...

3545
03:31:22,140 --> 03:31:23,380
But it might be useful later.

3546
03:31:24,360 --> 03:31:24,720
Yeah.

3547
03:31:25,500 --> 03:31:27,040
I thought it might be like a fast...

3548
03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:29,200
That's why I was like, oh, if I'm as the box.

3549
03:31:29,440 --> 03:31:31,240
But I'm just a yellow box.

3550
03:31:32,280 --> 03:31:33,460
I'm just a yellow box.

3551
03:31:33,460 --> 03:31:34,400
Nobody wants me.

3552
03:31:36,160 --> 03:31:37,240
This is sad.

3553
03:31:40,540 --> 03:31:42,240
Alright, what else was there?

3554
03:31:44,380 --> 03:31:46,520
I think there was a noisy area.

3555
03:31:48,520 --> 03:31:49,680
Up there.

3556
03:31:51,220 --> 03:31:52,740
Up here.

3557
03:31:53,880 --> 03:31:55,920
There's a noisy area we can go through.

3558
03:32:06,250 --> 03:32:06,970
I'm going.

3559
03:32:08,550 --> 03:32:10,310
But I'm being very quiet.

3560
03:32:15,710 --> 03:32:17,070
Chop grenade.

3561
03:32:17,470 --> 03:32:17,830
Okay.

3562
03:32:21,430 --> 03:32:22,070
Okay.

3563
03:32:24,910 --> 03:32:26,770
Maybe if you add the Amazon logo.

3564
03:32:27,230 --> 03:32:27,590
Maybe.

3565
03:32:33,480 --> 03:32:34,620
I'm not being noisy.

3566
03:32:35,520 --> 03:32:36,980
I'm being very quiet.

3567
03:32:37,260 --> 03:32:37,900
It's stealthy.

3568
03:32:41,320 --> 03:32:42,600
In fact, I might be...

3569
03:32:42,600 --> 03:32:43,340
Oh, what was that?

3570
03:32:45,860 --> 03:32:46,500
Grenade.

3571
03:32:47,180 --> 03:32:48,960
Oh my gosh, please give me something.

3572
03:32:49,740 --> 03:32:50,140
Anything.

3573
03:32:54,890 --> 03:32:57,030
Can I... I couldn't go through this door, right?

3574
03:32:58,190 --> 03:32:58,850
Oh shoot.

3575
03:33:19,010 --> 03:33:19,850
He's looking.

3576
03:33:20,150 --> 03:33:22,150
Oh, he's looking, looking, looking.

3577
03:33:51,870 --> 03:33:53,790
I'm waiting for him to come back.

3578
03:33:54,890 --> 03:33:56,190
Where else was...

3579
03:33:56,190 --> 03:33:57,450
Oh, I guess we can go upstairs.

3580
03:33:58,170 --> 03:33:59,210
We'll go upstairs then.

3581
03:34:00,470 --> 03:34:01,470
Because we're in the basement.

3582
03:34:16,280 --> 03:34:17,300
Back to box.

3583
03:34:22,130 --> 03:34:22,970
Oh gosh.

3584
03:34:22,970 --> 03:34:26,210
Took a bit of a risk there, but...

3585
03:34:26,210 --> 03:34:26,650
It's good.

3586
03:34:26,730 --> 03:34:27,430
It's all good.

3587
03:34:32,760 --> 03:34:34,100
I think we're good here too.

3588
03:34:34,240 --> 03:34:34,660
Nice.

3589
03:34:35,520 --> 03:34:35,880
Alright.

3590
03:34:40,920 --> 03:34:42,580
That guy couldn't see me, right?

3591
03:34:42,940 --> 03:34:43,840
I don't think so.

3592
03:34:59,560 --> 03:35:01,240
Okay, let's go to...

3593
03:35:03,700 --> 03:35:04,220
Floor...

3594
03:35:04,220 --> 03:35:04,980
Eight?

3595
03:35:05,940 --> 03:35:07,320
Wait, we're at B1.

3596
03:35:08,120 --> 03:35:09,360
Then we go to Floor 1.

3597
03:35:09,360 --> 03:35:11,440
And then we go to...

3598
03:35:11,440 --> 03:35:12,000
Eight?

3599
03:35:16,200 --> 03:35:18,100
I've never seen Minto focus that much.

3600
03:35:19,200 --> 03:35:20,020
Just chill.

3601
03:35:24,260 --> 03:35:25,720
Where are the child soldiers?

3602
03:35:27,140 --> 03:35:29,940
The ones that are like, I love daddy, big boss.

3603
03:35:33,020 --> 03:35:35,160
Oh no, it's like that Pokemon...

3604
03:35:38,120 --> 03:35:40,660
Oh my gosh, it really is just like that Pokemon...

3605
03:35:44,160 --> 03:35:45,700
I'm a yellow box!

3606
03:35:48,120 --> 03:35:49,920
We're going to the yellow box area.

3607
03:35:58,430 --> 03:36:00,370
Yellow, send me to the yellow area!

3608
03:36:01,550 --> 03:36:02,470
Send me yellow!

3609
03:36:02,850 --> 03:36:03,790
Yellow, yellow, yellow!

3610
03:36:04,550 --> 03:36:05,750
I'm a yellow box!

3611
03:36:07,950 --> 03:36:09,330
Team Rocket hideout.

3612
03:36:09,430 --> 03:36:10,610
Yeah, why should I?

3613
03:36:14,410 --> 03:36:16,450
I'm a yellow box!

3614
03:36:16,810 --> 03:36:17,850
Where are we going?

3615
03:36:18,990 --> 03:36:20,510
Oh, I'm going to be so lost.

3616
03:36:22,410 --> 03:36:25,730
But, this might be... Oh my gosh, do you see the radar?

3617
03:36:25,890 --> 03:36:26,570
It's so bad.

3618
03:36:27,330 --> 03:36:28,250
I'm a yellow box!

3619
03:36:33,440 --> 03:36:38,180
People say fast travel, but I think this might be the slowest fast travel I've ever experienced.

3620
03:36:50,250 --> 03:36:51,010
Cardboard box!

3621
03:37:12,120 --> 03:37:13,840
Oh, we're all the way here!

3622
03:37:27,140 --> 03:37:27,700
Okay.

3623
03:37:29,580 --> 03:37:33,380
We have to go all the way back to the conveyor belt.

3624
03:37:33,660 --> 03:37:34,160
How fun.

3625
03:37:41,580 --> 03:37:42,640
Just a box.

3626
03:37:42,860 --> 03:37:43,140
Red.

3627
03:37:44,800 --> 03:37:47,160
All my red boxes, rise up!

3628
03:37:47,220 --> 03:37:48,680
It's our time!

3629
03:37:49,620 --> 03:37:52,440
I'm going to change my weapon before I...

3630
03:37:54,560 --> 03:37:55,820
Let's change it to that.

3631
03:37:56,260 --> 03:37:58,360
I don't know, maybe it'll be useful.

3632
03:38:28,250 --> 03:38:29,010
Yosha!

3633
03:38:29,010 --> 03:38:29,770
Yosha!

3634
03:38:30,690 --> 03:38:31,370
Yosha!

3635
03:38:31,690 --> 03:38:32,290
And box.

3636
03:38:33,230 --> 03:38:34,570
But red box this time.

3637
03:38:36,290 --> 03:38:37,390
How fun.

3638
03:38:38,630 --> 03:38:41,210
It's really nice getting...

3639
03:38:41,710 --> 03:38:44,030
Oh, thank goodness he's blind!

3640
03:38:49,790 --> 03:38:50,550
Sheesh.

3641
03:38:51,110 --> 03:38:51,330
Okay.

3642
03:38:51,790 --> 03:38:52,910
Diagonal crawling?

3643
03:38:53,830 --> 03:38:55,290
What an age we live in, right?

3644
03:38:56,270 --> 03:38:57,030
Craziness.

3645
03:39:02,170 --> 03:39:03,150
There we go.

3646
03:39:05,640 --> 03:39:08,040
Oh wait, I need the box.

3647
03:39:08,320 --> 03:39:09,180
There we go.

3648
03:39:09,960 --> 03:39:11,400
I need my hands for you.

3649
03:39:14,960 --> 03:39:16,500
Let me in.

3650
03:39:17,240 --> 03:39:17,620
Alright.

3651
03:39:18,460 --> 03:39:19,260
Upwards we go.

3652
03:39:20,160 --> 03:39:21,840
To the red box area.

3653
03:39:23,020 --> 03:39:23,720
How exciting.

3654
03:39:26,400 --> 03:39:28,040
And up once again.

3655
03:39:30,140 --> 03:39:31,620
Oh, again?

3656
03:39:36,540 --> 03:39:39,320
I am doing this correctly, right?

3657
03:39:41,900 --> 03:39:47,280
Like, the intention is to get the red box and then do it all over again, right?

3658
03:39:48,620 --> 03:39:49,760
I assume.

3659
03:39:53,820 --> 03:39:55,160
Well, here we go.

3660
03:40:07,510 --> 03:40:08,450
Wait a second.

3661
03:40:17,020 --> 03:40:18,540
I think I have to...

3662
03:40:29,420 --> 03:40:32,300
Can you change the box while on the belt?

3663
03:40:36,520 --> 03:40:37,780
Let's try it after.

3664
03:40:40,680 --> 03:40:44,860
Okay, and it's not like one of those things where you go through and it activates a switch and...

3665
03:40:45,460 --> 03:40:46,020
Okay, let's see.

3666
03:40:46,740 --> 03:40:48,420
We start as a yellow box.

3667
03:40:49,060 --> 03:40:51,300
Oh my gosh, this is some real, like...

3668
03:40:53,860 --> 03:40:54,120
Yellow.

3669
03:40:57,590 --> 03:40:58,830
Oh, I have to say yellow.

3670
03:40:58,990 --> 03:41:00,390
Wait, what if I'm a red box?

3671
03:41:02,230 --> 03:41:04,070
I'm kind of curious what happens.

3672
03:41:06,950 --> 03:41:07,370
Okay.

3673
03:41:08,310 --> 03:41:09,430
Alright, I learned my lesson.

3674
03:41:09,590 --> 03:41:10,770
I experimented.

3675
03:41:10,890 --> 03:41:11,730
I experimented.

3676
03:41:13,950 --> 03:41:14,950
There we go.

3677
03:41:15,030 --> 03:41:15,150
Okay.

3678
03:41:25,280 --> 03:41:27,160
I'm a yellow box.

3679
03:41:27,420 --> 03:41:29,380
I'm a yellow box.

3680
03:41:29,660 --> 03:41:30,760
I'm a yellow box.

3681
03:41:30,800 --> 03:41:31,240
Just kidding.

3682
03:41:31,520 --> 03:41:32,420
I'm a red box.

3683
03:41:34,280 --> 03:41:35,840
I'm a red box.

3684
03:41:40,640 --> 03:41:41,760
Where are we going?

3685
03:41:51,040 --> 03:41:53,240
I want to be... Oh, no, no!

3686
03:41:53,680 --> 03:41:55,440
I meant to change to the yellow box.

3687
03:41:56,240 --> 03:41:56,700
Dang it.

3688
03:41:56,880 --> 03:41:58,680
We're going to get returned to sender again.

3689
03:41:59,960 --> 03:42:00,320
No!

3690
03:42:09,320 --> 03:42:11,200
I'm a yellow box.

3691
03:42:11,660 --> 03:42:14,480
I wasn't fast enough before I realized what was happening.

3692
03:42:22,850 --> 03:42:23,870
Just kidding.

3693
03:42:24,070 --> 03:42:25,250
I'm a red box.

3694
03:42:38,740 --> 03:42:39,980
I'm a yellow box.

3695
03:42:41,860 --> 03:42:42,860
Before I forget.

3696
03:42:45,340 --> 03:42:47,020
Got distracted by grooving.

3697
03:42:47,340 --> 03:42:49,000
You are 100% correct.

3698
03:42:50,420 --> 03:42:52,400
That is exactly what happened.

3699
03:43:05,570 --> 03:43:07,570
What the... Oh, I'm all the way here?

3700
03:43:14,100 --> 03:43:15,860
Okay, we got to do it again.

3701
03:43:15,860 --> 03:43:16,060
Again.

3702
03:43:34,660 --> 03:43:40,440
Okay, so the second time is when it gives us the choice between red and yellow.

3703
03:43:40,640 --> 03:43:42,300
We choose yellow.

3704
03:43:44,460 --> 03:43:45,060
Again!

3705
03:43:45,340 --> 03:43:45,560
Again!

3706
03:43:45,820 --> 03:43:45,980
Again!

3707
03:43:59,640 --> 03:44:02,400
Let's do it one more time.

3708
03:44:03,000 --> 03:44:04,460
Probably more than one more time.

3709
03:44:04,540 --> 03:44:05,200
I'm not going to lie.

3710
03:44:07,440 --> 03:44:10,880
We are a yellow box for a while.

3711
03:44:17,840 --> 03:44:19,340
Here, we're yellow.

3712
03:44:19,340 --> 03:44:20,460
Yellow!

3713
03:44:21,200 --> 03:44:23,340
Next one, yellow.

3714
03:44:23,840 --> 03:44:24,420
Not red.

3715
03:44:26,920 --> 03:44:27,940
Yellow!

3716
03:44:34,040 --> 03:44:35,060
Red.

3717
03:44:44,190 --> 03:44:45,870
Which one do I choose?

3718
03:44:56,020 --> 03:44:58,320
One more time!

3719
03:45:00,940 --> 03:45:03,120
What's the shipping cost for a box of mint?

3720
03:45:08,420 --> 03:45:10,120
Return to sender.

3721
03:45:11,120 --> 03:45:13,160
The shipping costs are extreme.

3722
03:45:14,560 --> 03:45:15,920
Okay, yellow.

3723
03:45:18,300 --> 03:45:19,520
This song.

3724
03:45:19,900 --> 03:45:21,560
I'm going to hear it in my dreams tonight.

3725
03:45:30,350 --> 03:45:32,590
I think you need the blue box.

3726
03:45:33,030 --> 03:45:34,370
Well, we got to find the blue box.

3727
03:45:37,930 --> 03:45:39,290
Now red.

3728
03:45:40,290 --> 03:45:42,750
And then we immediately switch back to yellow.

3729
03:45:44,330 --> 03:45:45,910
So now back to yellow.

3730
03:45:56,270 --> 03:45:56,990
Wait.

3731
03:45:58,550 --> 03:45:59,190
Red?

3732
03:46:01,910 --> 03:46:02,830
I don't know.

3733
03:46:04,010 --> 03:46:05,190
This is new.

3734
03:46:05,730 --> 03:46:06,810
This is new territory.

3735
03:46:14,000 --> 03:46:16,500
We actually made it out somewhere.

3736
03:46:19,720 --> 03:46:20,420
Oh.

3737
03:46:27,380 --> 03:46:29,280
Take me home!

3738
03:46:36,940 --> 03:46:38,340
No way.

3739
03:46:44,720 --> 03:46:46,460
Wait, is this taking us?

3740
03:46:48,840 --> 03:46:50,400
Is this returning to...

3741
03:46:52,280 --> 03:46:54,800
I don't know if we've gone this way before.

3742
03:46:54,880 --> 03:46:55,480
Let's do red.

3743
03:47:00,360 --> 03:47:01,820
A new place!

3744
03:47:02,080 --> 03:47:03,280
An actual new place.

3745
03:47:06,580 --> 03:47:08,480
A place we can actually...

3746
03:47:10,000 --> 03:47:10,560
Gas!

3747
03:47:14,500 --> 03:47:15,900
And there's men!

3748
03:47:16,300 --> 03:47:16,540
No!

3749
03:47:17,680 --> 03:47:19,600
No men in the gas room, please!

3750
03:47:20,960 --> 03:47:21,960
ID card 3!

3751
03:47:24,740 --> 03:47:25,680
Oh shoot.

3752
03:47:25,980 --> 03:47:27,580
Okay, I'm going to have to take him out, I think.

3753
03:47:33,310 --> 03:47:34,670
Gas, gas, gas.

3754
03:47:38,970 --> 03:47:39,530
Okay.

3755
03:47:40,210 --> 03:47:40,770
Alright.

3756
03:47:41,510 --> 03:47:42,210
Letter 02.

3757
03:47:42,970 --> 03:47:43,530
Replenish.

3758
03:47:44,050 --> 03:47:44,310
Okay.

3759
03:47:44,910 --> 03:47:45,910
Men in the gas room.

3760
03:47:48,510 --> 03:47:50,310
It's kind of horrible and mean.

3761
03:47:51,030 --> 03:47:52,430
You don't think he'll die this time, do you?

3762
03:47:52,950 --> 03:47:53,330
Oh god.

3763
03:47:56,820 --> 03:47:57,380
Leave!

3764
03:48:02,720 --> 03:48:03,140
Uh...

3765
03:48:04,420 --> 03:48:06,740
We have... The world is our oyster now!

3766
03:48:06,800 --> 03:48:08,800
We have so many more locations we can go to.

3767
03:48:09,100 --> 03:48:10,480
Now that we're at level 3.

3768
03:48:11,120 --> 03:48:12,200
Have we been here before?

3769
03:48:12,720 --> 03:48:14,220
This place is so confusing.

3770
03:48:16,860 --> 03:48:17,280
Wait.

3771
03:48:18,200 --> 03:48:20,100
No, I don't know if we have...

3772
03:48:20,100 --> 03:48:21,420
I'm going to become a yellow box.

3773
03:48:24,180 --> 03:48:25,240
I don't know.

3774
03:48:25,800 --> 03:48:28,200
Wait, oh, I thought that person was going...

3775
03:48:28,200 --> 03:48:28,980
Oh, nevermind.

3776
03:48:37,030 --> 03:48:38,170
It all looks the same to me.

3777
03:48:38,370 --> 03:48:39,050
Me too!

3778
03:48:39,430 --> 03:48:40,490
I can't tell!

3779
03:48:51,950 --> 03:48:53,030
We're at the elevator.

3780
03:48:54,630 --> 03:48:56,010
Is this the first floor?

3781
03:48:58,150 --> 03:49:00,770
Yeah, this is the first floor!

3782
03:49:03,610 --> 03:49:07,250
But that's okay, because there's a door over here that I think we can now go through.

3783
03:49:11,070 --> 03:49:12,270
But I think it's good.

3784
03:49:12,270 --> 03:49:13,690
It's actually okay.

3785
03:49:18,980 --> 03:49:19,860
Yeah, bing bing!

3786
03:49:20,040 --> 03:49:20,760
And then bing bing!

3787
03:49:21,260 --> 03:49:21,900
Bing bing!

3788
03:49:22,660 --> 03:49:23,100
Nice!

3789
03:49:26,300 --> 03:49:27,000
What's this?

3790
03:49:29,520 --> 03:49:30,220
Chop grenade!

3791
03:49:30,960 --> 03:49:31,740
Is it time to save?

3792
03:49:31,760 --> 03:49:32,160
You know what?

3793
03:49:32,260 --> 03:49:32,480
Yeah.

3794
03:49:33,320 --> 03:49:34,640
It's been a minute since we've talked to... Oh.

3795
03:49:34,980 --> 03:49:35,780
Talked to anybody.

3796
03:49:37,700 --> 03:49:39,580
Let's talk in the codec a little bit.

3797
03:49:39,880 --> 03:49:41,140
Campbell, how's it going?

3798
03:49:47,310 --> 03:49:53,270
The engineer who designed Metal Gear is being held somewhere in that building.

3799
03:49:53,410 --> 03:49:54,010
Yeah, that's right.

3800
03:49:54,090 --> 03:49:55,710
I forgot we were looking for that guy.

3801
03:49:58,070 --> 03:50:04,290
Rescue him and get as much information about Metal Gear out of him as possible.

3802
03:50:04,590 --> 03:50:05,050
Okay.

3803
03:50:07,410 --> 03:50:08,410
I'll save.

3804
03:50:14,390 --> 03:50:15,410
What's up, Snake?

3805
03:50:16,180 --> 03:50:16,630
Okay.

3806
03:50:18,310 --> 03:50:19,670
Ever heard of this?

3807
03:50:20,430 --> 03:50:22,410
Dr. Coplethorn says...

3808
03:50:23,890 --> 03:50:31,610
Look, these quotations and sayings are great, but I'd also like to get to know you!

3809
03:50:34,570 --> 03:50:41,170
Foolish is the one who offers deep confidence in shallow alliance.

3810
03:50:42,990 --> 03:50:43,230
What?

3811
03:50:44,990 --> 03:50:46,810
It's a Chinese proverb.

3812
03:50:47,810 --> 03:50:54,790
Means that it's unwise to tell important things to someone you don't even know.

3813
03:50:56,770 --> 03:50:57,270
Great.

3814
03:50:59,830 --> 03:51:02,890
I wish these were voiced so I could eat some of my sandwich.

3815
03:51:03,030 --> 03:51:04,650
Do you guys mind if I take a couple bites?

3816
03:51:04,830 --> 03:51:05,550
I'm getting hungry.

3817
03:51:09,420 --> 03:51:11,620
I can't believe it's already been four hours.

3818
03:51:17,570 --> 03:51:21,810
I... it doesn't feel like it at all for me.

3819
03:51:28,950 --> 03:51:35,510
Like in most African states, Kindra is an ethnically diverse nation.

3820
03:51:38,190 --> 03:51:48,030
Since each group has its own language, there's a large number of languages in use within the national border.

3821
03:51:51,030 --> 03:51:55,270
On the other hand, the official language is French.

3822
03:51:56,310 --> 03:52:02,490
So you shouldn't have any trouble communicating your intentions.

3823
03:52:03,030 --> 03:52:08,030
As long as you brush up on your language skills.

3824
03:52:09,350 --> 03:52:09,690
Okay.

3825
03:52:14,590 --> 03:52:20,070
Where are... oh wait, I think I... I think I know where we are here too.

3826
03:52:22,710 --> 03:52:23,950
We've been here before too.

3827
03:52:24,010 --> 03:52:25,770
This is the elevator right over to the right.

3828
03:52:27,230 --> 03:52:31,510
Okay, so we just went in a circle, which is fine, but...

3829
03:52:36,720 --> 03:52:37,200
Yeah.

3830
03:52:38,080 --> 03:52:42,730
We have to find the blue box.

3831
03:52:45,310 --> 03:52:47,930
What other areas could we not go in?

3832
03:52:51,580 --> 03:52:53,520
Because we didn't have a card key.

3833
03:52:54,780 --> 03:52:55,260
We're

3834
03:52:59,220 --> 03:53:00,280
over there, I think.

3835
03:53:02,760 --> 03:53:04,420
I'm starting to not remember.

3836
03:53:07,400 --> 03:53:10,380
Take the card key to the... oh, to the conveyor belt door, you're right.

3837
03:53:14,920 --> 03:53:16,820
Do you want me to give you a hint where the blue box is?

3838
03:53:19,360 --> 03:53:23,160
Let me go to the conveyor belt door first, and then I will ask.

3839
03:53:23,520 --> 03:53:23,960
Thank you.

3840
03:53:26,660 --> 03:53:28,500
Yeah, let's do that first.

3841
03:53:30,860 --> 03:53:32,680
Let's go there, and then we'll...

3842
03:53:34,540 --> 03:53:35,040
Yeah, yeah.

3843
03:53:36,520 --> 03:53:37,840
Probably another branch up.

3844
03:53:37,880 --> 03:53:41,700
Yeah, I don't think we exhausted all of the options, honestly.

3845
03:53:42,020 --> 03:53:44,440
I have like no weapon, no nothing.

3846
03:53:49,070 --> 03:53:51,610
If I was Snake, I would have said, who asked?

3847
03:53:53,790 --> 03:53:54,270
True.

3848
03:53:56,950 --> 03:53:57,430
Okay.

3849
03:54:00,730 --> 03:54:00,990
Oh.

3850
03:54:01,410 --> 03:54:04,030
I have to go up.

3851
03:54:04,230 --> 03:54:05,210
Wait, oh wait.

3852
03:54:07,870 --> 03:54:11,350
No, this is where we... I'm so lost.

3853
03:54:19,110 --> 03:54:20,070
We have to go up one more.

3854
03:54:31,900 --> 03:54:32,680
This one.

3855
03:54:33,620 --> 03:54:36,720
There's too much to see, there's too much to see.

3856
03:54:40,360 --> 03:54:40,880
Okay.

3857
03:54:46,980 --> 03:54:48,320
What if I go as a person?

3858
03:55:07,930 --> 03:55:09,450
And this is yellow too.

3859
03:55:09,610 --> 03:55:15,540
And this one is red.

3860
03:55:20,180 --> 03:55:23,320
Because we didn't go yellow and then see if there was any more red, you know?

3861
03:55:28,270 --> 03:55:33,270
So it could be that there's more red options without going the other way.

3862
03:55:33,890 --> 03:55:34,070
Oh wait.

3863
03:55:35,630 --> 03:55:36,230
Red here?

3864
03:55:48,290 --> 03:55:49,530
Keycard 3.

3865
03:55:50,110 --> 03:55:50,430
Yeah!

3866
03:55:51,670 --> 03:55:53,170
We made it!

3867
03:55:58,500 --> 03:55:59,940
And some rations!

3868
03:56:00,620 --> 03:56:01,300
Lucky, lucky.

3869
03:56:10,380 --> 03:56:11,400
Oh no.

3870
03:56:11,820 --> 03:56:12,140
No!

3871
03:56:13,420 --> 03:56:14,140
No!

3872
03:56:21,090 --> 03:56:22,810
Sun grenade, okay.

3873
03:56:23,830 --> 03:56:25,730
We're just dancing with this fella for a second.

3874
03:56:30,550 --> 03:56:32,310
I can't with this song.

3875
03:56:36,110 --> 03:56:39,450
The next time you're awake, can you record a video of you just wiggling?

3876
03:56:40,330 --> 03:56:42,290
I think that can feed us for a long time.

3877
03:56:43,130 --> 03:56:44,730
What are you talking about?

3878
03:56:46,270 --> 03:56:46,710
Blue!

3879
03:56:47,350 --> 03:56:48,230
Blue box!

3880
03:56:49,910 --> 03:56:53,230
Whoever was going to give me the hint, thank you, but I don't need it!

3881
03:56:53,290 --> 03:56:54,330
I got the blue box!

3882
03:56:57,190 --> 03:56:57,630
Alright.

3883
03:57:13,140 --> 03:57:15,320
I know where this is because I explored it.

3884
03:57:16,300 --> 03:57:17,040
I know.

3885
03:57:19,800 --> 03:57:22,540
Because I went entirely through it.

3886
03:57:23,940 --> 03:57:26,460
I went entirely through it.

3887
03:57:53,080 --> 03:57:55,720
And this is why you stay boxed, everybody.

3888
03:58:05,040 --> 03:58:07,080
I think they go down that little hallway.

3889
03:58:12,910 --> 03:58:13,210
Alright.

3890
03:58:25,960 --> 03:58:27,360
Okay, back to...

3891
03:58:29,140 --> 03:58:30,180
the rooftop.

3892
03:58:38,650 --> 03:58:40,750
I hate how slow the cameras are.

3893
03:58:40,750 --> 03:58:43,570
I mean, again, it's good that they're slow.

3894
03:58:44,030 --> 03:58:46,330
But also, why you gotta be so slow?

3895
03:58:51,990 --> 03:58:53,090
Stealthy box.

3896
03:58:57,210 --> 03:58:57,910
Upwards!

3897
03:58:58,090 --> 03:58:58,510
Upwards!

3898
03:59:00,910 --> 03:59:02,710
Don't mention fortresses.

3899
03:59:02,790 --> 03:59:04,050
I'm still scarred from Minecraft.

3900
03:59:04,050 --> 03:59:04,310
Minecraft.

3901
03:59:09,110 --> 03:59:10,430
You're scarred.

3902
03:59:11,070 --> 03:59:12,970
You're scarred from Minecraft?

3903
03:59:14,610 --> 03:59:16,030
Must be nice.

3904
03:59:16,990 --> 03:59:18,790
For that to be your burden.

3905
03:59:21,190 --> 03:59:22,390
Alright, blue belt.

3906
03:59:49,530 --> 03:59:50,710
Where are we going?

3907
03:59:52,420 --> 03:59:52,750
Yellow.

3908
03:59:54,230 --> 03:59:55,990
No, otherwise we're going to get returned to sender.

3909
04:00:05,190 --> 04:00:08,190
I didn't see where... I didn't see where the middle one went.

3910
04:00:08,550 --> 04:00:09,290
Oh no, wait.

3911
04:00:09,770 --> 04:00:10,970
I think we have to stay yellow.

3912
04:00:11,530 --> 04:00:13,030
I think the middle one just goes back down.

3913
04:00:17,960 --> 04:00:18,220
Okay.

3914
04:00:19,020 --> 04:00:19,260
Okay.

3915
04:00:21,300 --> 04:00:22,100
Nothing here.

3916
04:00:23,960 --> 04:00:24,360
Wait!

3917
04:00:24,520 --> 04:00:25,320
I should have been blue!

3918
04:00:39,790 --> 04:00:41,750
This is back where we got the red box.

3919
04:00:42,370 --> 04:00:42,650
What?

3920
04:00:44,990 --> 04:00:46,330
Maybe I should have switched?

3921
04:00:53,810 --> 04:00:56,890
Can someone just... Okay, I'm asking...

3922
04:00:58,230 --> 04:00:59,750
I'm asking for hints now.

3923
04:01:00,450 --> 04:01:01,690
I'm asking for hints now.

3924
04:01:07,940 --> 04:01:09,340
I got the blue box.

3925
04:01:10,140 --> 04:01:11,640
I'm getting blue box right now.

3926
04:01:26,760 --> 04:01:31,660
Wherever that one person was that said where... they'll give me a hint for the blue box.

3927
04:01:31,980 --> 04:01:37,120
If you can also give me a hint of what to do from here.

3928
04:01:54,090 --> 04:01:57,070
Or else I'm just going to look up my own guide, but that will take longer.

3929
04:01:59,050 --> 04:02:01,170
This section is exactly why a guide is useful.

3930
04:02:01,690 --> 04:02:03,310
Okay, I'm going to look up my own guide then.

3931
04:02:22,780 --> 04:02:24,340
ID, level card 3.

3932
04:02:24,440 --> 04:02:25,080
We need to get that one.

3933
04:02:25,400 --> 04:02:26,900
Blue box, got that one.

3934
04:02:30,280 --> 04:02:32,560
We need to get the thermal goggles.

3935
04:02:32,900 --> 04:02:35,820
Okay, so star, yellow, blue.

3936
04:02:36,460 --> 04:02:36,660
Wait.

3937
04:02:40,780 --> 04:02:42,160
We need to go to the storeroom.

3938
04:02:42,300 --> 04:02:45,260
Need IR goggles to reach hearts.

3939
04:02:55,570 --> 04:02:56,990
So I go to the storeroom?

3940
04:03:33,040 --> 04:03:36,640
I have to go through the... since I need the IR goggles to reach hearts.

3941
04:03:37,320 --> 04:03:38,720
But I gotta go through the storeroom.

3942
04:03:38,800 --> 04:03:40,980
Hopefully the storeroom doesn't need the IR goggles.

3943
04:03:42,140 --> 04:03:45,640
Because we have to go through them to get to the thermal goggles.

3944
04:03:46,220 --> 04:03:53,380
So, right, up, left.

3945
04:03:54,360 --> 04:03:56,600
And then instead of yellow, we blue at the end.

3946
04:03:57,500 --> 04:03:58,800
And then we yellow again.

3947
04:04:01,760 --> 04:04:02,860
I'm looking at the guide for you.

3948
04:04:02,960 --> 04:04:03,520
It's confusing.

3949
04:04:03,660 --> 04:04:04,260
It is, right?

3950
04:04:07,320 --> 04:04:08,600
So we're yellow.

3951
04:04:16,560 --> 04:04:17,740
And then we go up.

3952
04:04:17,940 --> 04:04:18,320
We blue.

3953
04:04:26,440 --> 04:04:28,360
And then... sorry.

3954
04:04:29,220 --> 04:04:30,480
We're going to be yellow again.

3955
04:04:32,100 --> 04:04:33,020
Just said!

3956
04:04:33,220 --> 04:04:34,160
Thank you for the hug so far!

3957
04:04:34,580 --> 04:04:37,040
We seriously need a clip of Wiggle Bit.

3958
04:04:39,540 --> 04:04:40,440
Thank you!

3959
04:04:40,840 --> 04:04:42,080
Thank you for the hug so far.

3960
04:04:42,160 --> 04:04:43,240
I really appreciate it.

3961
04:04:44,860 --> 04:04:47,420
Okay, I will put together a clip.

3962
04:04:47,980 --> 04:04:49,480
Wait, okay, here...

3963
04:04:52,940 --> 04:04:53,400
We blue.

3964
04:04:58,920 --> 04:05:02,320
She's using psychokinetic wiggles.

3965
04:05:04,640 --> 04:05:08,060
I've kind of been really obsessed with watching... you know the Wiggles?

3966
04:05:08,220 --> 04:05:08,780
The Wiggles?

3967
04:05:09,160 --> 04:05:13,360
I've been kind of obsessed with watching videos of The Wiggles recently.

3968
04:05:14,680 --> 04:05:16,340
Oh my god, this is the storeroom?

3969
04:05:16,720 --> 04:05:18,240
Why is it like all bricked up?

3970
04:05:23,650 --> 04:05:25,870
It doesn't look like storage at all.

3971
04:05:25,970 --> 04:05:26,810
It looks like bricks.

3972
04:05:28,470 --> 04:05:30,530
Okay, I'm just going to stay as a box, I think.

3973
04:05:34,020 --> 04:05:34,540
Ah...

3974
04:05:36,580 --> 04:05:37,620
Turn around!

3975
04:05:37,840 --> 04:05:38,420
There we go.

3976
04:05:44,580 --> 04:05:45,520
Over here.

3977
04:05:52,300 --> 04:05:55,500
We have to go onto the other conveyor belt and go as blue.

3978
04:06:06,490 --> 04:06:07,010
Save!

3979
04:06:07,430 --> 04:06:08,150
Wait, what's in here?

3980
04:06:09,250 --> 04:06:09,950
Oh, nevermind.

3981
04:06:10,270 --> 04:06:11,910
Can I... can I... can I... nope.

3982
04:06:12,430 --> 04:06:13,550
There we go.

3983
04:06:13,970 --> 04:06:14,290
Let's go!

3984
04:06:21,500 --> 04:06:22,300
Wait, wait, wait!

3985
04:06:22,300 --> 04:06:23,560
Sorry.

3986
04:06:24,540 --> 04:06:25,220
Red.

3987
04:06:25,720 --> 04:06:26,400
Red, red.

3988
04:06:28,320 --> 04:06:28,980
Okay.

3989
04:06:30,180 --> 04:06:31,440
Gave me a tummy ache.

3990
04:06:31,460 --> 04:06:32,160
I got so scared.

3991
04:06:34,860 --> 04:06:36,060
The panic.

3992
04:06:38,240 --> 04:06:38,600
Yay!

3993
04:06:41,520 --> 04:06:42,200
Derpacagos!

3994
04:06:42,760 --> 04:06:43,820
Where are we?

3995
04:06:47,400 --> 04:06:48,700
This is not open?

3996
04:06:48,900 --> 04:06:49,460
It's a door.

3997
04:06:49,460 --> 04:06:49,560
Door.

3998
04:06:57,100 --> 04:06:58,720
Where does this lead us to?

3999
04:06:59,420 --> 04:07:00,580
Nobody knows.

4000
04:07:06,090 --> 04:07:07,770
Oh, it's sleepy guy!

4001
04:07:08,570 --> 04:07:10,790
I don't remember where sleepy guy was though.

4002
04:07:12,910 --> 04:07:13,510
But...

4003
04:07:15,460 --> 04:07:17,100
Okay, he's asleep.

4004
04:07:21,370 --> 04:07:22,630
Where was he?

4005
04:07:29,010 --> 04:07:30,090
Go on, I'm sleepy.

4006
04:07:36,370 --> 04:07:38,090
Oh wait, I do know where we are.

4007
04:07:48,620 --> 04:07:49,400
Box.

4008
04:07:50,860 --> 04:07:53,860
I feel... asleep.

4009
04:08:02,540 --> 04:08:04,900
I feel... asleep.

4010
04:08:05,180 --> 04:08:05,380
Alright.

4011
04:08:06,600 --> 04:08:10,920
I think we've been to this floor like maybe 500 bajillion times.

4012
04:08:17,540 --> 04:08:21,180
Okay, now we go back to the storage room.

4013
04:08:23,720 --> 04:08:26,000
And we go to Harker.

4014
04:08:26,660 --> 04:08:28,260
Before we do anything else.

4015
04:08:29,380 --> 04:08:29,860
Before...

4016
04:08:29,860 --> 04:08:33,360
Well, the map kind of spoiled what's coming up.

4017
04:08:34,660 --> 04:08:39,220
The guide map kind of spoiled what's coming up next, but that's okay.

4018
04:08:40,540 --> 04:08:42,100
I won't tell you guys.

4019
04:08:42,560 --> 04:08:44,220
Yeah, we gotta go to the dark room first.

4020
04:08:45,980 --> 04:08:46,420
Okay.

4021
04:08:47,800 --> 04:08:49,720
Sorry, I just need my mic.

4022
04:08:51,080 --> 04:08:53,640
Okay, let me get my guide back up.

4023
04:08:53,700 --> 04:08:54,760
Okay, good, good, good.

4024
04:09:07,450 --> 04:09:08,330
Yellow, yellow.

4025
04:10:05,200 --> 04:10:07,000
We are back, baby.

4026
04:10:07,400 --> 04:10:07,920
I'm back.

4027
04:10:10,260 --> 04:10:12,840
That might have been risky, but I just wanted to see.

4028
04:10:17,510 --> 04:10:19,130
That might have been very risky.

4029
04:10:20,870 --> 04:10:23,350
Oh, I don't know how long he stays there.

4030
04:10:23,530 --> 04:10:24,030
Okay, nevermind.

4031
04:10:41,970 --> 04:10:42,850
Knowledge get.

4032
04:10:46,210 --> 04:10:48,550
This guy moves so...

4033
04:10:48,550 --> 04:10:49,990
Plonk, plonk.

4034
04:10:56,440 --> 04:10:58,560
Alright, maybe prepare your eyes.

4035
04:11:09,120 --> 04:11:10,820
We could have made it.

4036
04:11:20,340 --> 04:11:21,620
Do I still need the mic?

4037
04:11:23,620 --> 04:11:24,640
Nope, we're good.

4038
04:11:26,940 --> 04:11:27,420
Stairs.

4039
04:11:31,380 --> 04:11:33,200
I think that's where we were before, right?

4040
04:11:33,200 --> 04:11:33,660
Oh!

4041
04:11:37,300 --> 04:11:39,540
I'm just a box.

4042
04:11:42,400 --> 04:11:43,780
Oh, I was short.

4043
04:11:44,780 --> 04:11:45,840
That's okay, baby.

4044
04:12:00,350 --> 04:12:01,910
I think I can hide in this...

4045
04:12:01,910 --> 04:12:02,910
Who's that?

4046
04:12:07,930 --> 04:12:09,230
He can't hear me.

4047
04:12:10,530 --> 04:12:11,570
Is that him?

4048
04:12:12,170 --> 04:12:13,090
Is that our wizard?

4049
04:12:14,450 --> 04:12:15,370
Oh, wow.

4050
04:12:19,650 --> 04:12:20,610
Wow, he's...

4051
04:12:23,500 --> 04:12:24,460
That's our...

4052
04:12:24,460 --> 04:12:25,420
I think that's our wizard.

4053
04:12:26,860 --> 04:12:27,540
Please, no.

4054
04:12:27,680 --> 04:12:28,780
Please, please, please, please.

4055
04:12:29,000 --> 04:12:29,960
Turn to the right.

4056
04:12:30,360 --> 04:12:31,460
I mean the left!

4057
04:12:31,700 --> 04:12:31,880
I meant

4058
04:12:39,870 --> 04:12:40,830
the...

4059
04:12:41,830 --> 04:12:43,930
This is what I had to say.

4060
04:12:44,470 --> 04:12:47,010
But I didn't want him to listen to me.

4061
04:12:48,050 --> 04:12:49,410
I think my box will be okay.

4062
04:12:49,410 --> 04:12:49,530
Okay.

4063
04:13:06,430 --> 04:13:07,230
Oh, goodness.

4064
04:13:07,970 --> 04:13:08,930
That made my tummy hurt.

4065
04:13:12,310 --> 04:13:13,630
That made my tummy hurt.

4066
04:13:18,720 --> 04:13:19,540
What's in here?

4067
04:13:19,740 --> 04:13:22,960
Oh, I think the way to get to him...

4068
04:13:22,960 --> 04:13:23,360
There we go!

4069
04:13:24,700 --> 04:13:28,040
He's like, the guy is like, why is this van coming in?

4070
04:13:28,220 --> 04:13:29,480
Why is this blue box moving?

4071
04:13:30,340 --> 04:13:30,740
Hey!

4072
04:13:32,140 --> 04:13:33,180
The wizard.

4073
04:13:35,380 --> 04:13:39,200
You don't have to look... Wait, you don't look like one of those goons.

4074
04:13:40,500 --> 04:13:41,640
We're no gooner.

4075
04:13:42,820 --> 04:13:43,920
Get me out of here!

4076
04:13:45,520 --> 04:13:46,100
Push a mark?

4077
04:13:46,440 --> 04:13:49,820
Or do you want me to yell for the guard?

4078
04:13:55,440 --> 04:13:56,480
You a hostage?

4079
04:13:57,220 --> 04:13:58,020
Name's Jimmy.

4080
04:13:59,640 --> 04:14:01,360
Is this a real Metal Gear game?

4081
04:14:01,520 --> 04:14:03,020
Yeah, it's a real Metal Gear game.

4082
04:14:07,300 --> 04:14:11,000
Yeah, they're like, complete losers.

4083
04:14:11,480 --> 04:14:15,040
At first, I got to do whatever I wanted.

4084
04:14:15,740 --> 04:14:22,880
Then, once Metal Gear neared completion, I got thrown into this dump.

4085
04:14:24,620 --> 04:14:27,820
Jimmy, you're James Harks?

4086
04:14:29,380 --> 04:14:32,820
You can call me Jimmy, the wizard.

4087
04:14:33,000 --> 04:14:35,780
If you're gonna get me out of here.

4088
04:14:37,880 --> 04:14:39,000
He's snarky.

4089
04:14:39,540 --> 04:14:43,040
They let a kid lead the Metal Gear development?

4090
04:14:48,220 --> 04:14:51,960
They've let children pilot Metal Gear Snake, so you know.

4091
04:14:54,140 --> 04:14:56,540
Yeah, I may be half your age.

4092
04:14:57,640 --> 04:15:00,440
But I'm twice as smart as you, buddy.

4093
04:15:03,440 --> 04:15:04,680
I'm not that old.

4094
04:15:06,940 --> 04:15:07,620
Really?

4095
04:15:08,280 --> 04:15:09,600
You look it, man.

4096
04:15:09,700 --> 04:15:10,340
Oh my god.

4097
04:15:10,960 --> 04:15:12,780
It's just because I'm a clone, okay?

4098
04:15:13,360 --> 04:15:15,000
It's fast aging.

4099
04:15:15,340 --> 04:15:16,280
Accelerated aging.

4100
04:15:16,400 --> 04:15:17,020
Because I'm a clone.

4101
04:15:17,520 --> 04:15:18,320
Who are you anyway?

4102
04:15:20,260 --> 04:15:21,140
Doesn't matter.

4103
04:15:22,880 --> 04:15:26,560
I'm the guy sent to get you and destroy Metal Gear.

4104
04:15:27,500 --> 04:15:30,320
And that's all you need to know.

4105
04:15:32,580 --> 04:15:34,380
Whatever, lone ranger.

4106
04:15:34,980 --> 04:15:37,240
You with the US military?

4107
04:15:39,180 --> 04:15:41,380
I'm not with any military.

4108
04:15:43,440 --> 04:15:44,200
What?

4109
04:15:44,440 --> 04:15:44,980
What the?

4110
04:15:46,540 --> 04:15:47,960
Just a misfit.

4111
04:15:49,920 --> 04:15:52,320
What the hell kind of answer is that?

4112
04:15:55,040 --> 04:15:57,500
Snake, you're not really making yourself...

4113
04:15:57,500 --> 04:16:01,780
Who cares as long as you get me out.

4114
04:16:02,680 --> 04:16:03,060
Come on.

4115
04:16:03,380 --> 04:16:04,920
I'm sick of this place.

4116
04:16:06,960 --> 04:16:09,420
There's no way past these bars.

4117
04:16:10,540 --> 04:16:12,400
Any other way into this room?

4118
04:16:14,860 --> 04:16:16,460
No, but...

4119
04:16:16,460 --> 04:16:17,620
But what?

4120
04:16:19,560 --> 04:16:25,040
I tapped on the walls and the east one sounds different.

4121
04:16:26,040 --> 04:16:29,180
It may be thinner than the other ones.

4122
04:16:29,480 --> 04:16:30,740
Oh no, do we need the C4?

4123
04:16:32,080 --> 04:16:33,040
The east wall, huh?

4124
04:16:33,400 --> 04:16:36,160
Okay, I'll get a hold of some explosives.

4125
04:16:36,920 --> 04:16:38,700
And try blowing through it.

4126
04:16:40,580 --> 04:16:41,600
Oh, there he goes.

4127
04:16:44,520 --> 04:16:45,600
Oh, that's it.

4128
04:16:45,800 --> 04:16:46,080
Okay.

4129
04:16:52,640 --> 04:16:53,480
There he is.

4130
04:16:53,560 --> 04:16:54,880
He's wandering around.

4131
04:16:56,380 --> 04:16:57,740
Oh my god.

4132
04:16:58,160 --> 04:16:59,760
He's an absolute unit.

4133
04:17:00,420 --> 04:17:01,500
Holy shit.

4134
04:17:03,860 --> 04:17:05,280
Oh my god.

4135
04:17:05,520 --> 04:17:07,180
Wait, is he only wearing one shoe?

4136
04:17:07,800 --> 04:17:08,820
Oh, nevermind.

4137
04:17:08,900 --> 04:17:09,740
Okay, we're fine.

4138
04:17:14,880 --> 04:17:17,300
Oh my god, is that Doki Bird in there?

4139
04:17:31,550 --> 04:17:33,250
That scared me.

4140
04:17:37,780 --> 04:17:39,100
Alright, so now...

4141
04:17:39,100 --> 04:17:41,120
Do you think he laughs and grows fat?

4142
04:17:42,100 --> 04:17:43,640
I believe so, honestly.

4143
04:17:44,720 --> 04:17:47,740
Maybe he's a genius and he grows up to become Fatman.

4144
04:17:48,940 --> 04:17:52,220
He built a bipedal nuclear...

4145
04:17:52,220 --> 04:17:56,240
Well, actually, I don't remember what this Metal Gear is like, if it's bipedal or not.

4146
04:17:56,700 --> 04:17:58,100
But he built a...

4147
04:17:58,840 --> 04:18:00,820
Oh, a portable?

4148
04:18:01,360 --> 04:18:01,740
Maybe?

4149
04:18:01,960 --> 04:18:02,420
Asterisk.

4150
04:18:03,420 --> 04:18:04,720
Nuclear walking device?

4151
04:18:04,980 --> 04:18:06,540
Nuclear... Wait, device?

4152
04:18:06,540 --> 04:18:10,820
And then he grows up to build bombs.

4153
04:18:11,960 --> 04:18:12,620
As well.

4154
04:18:13,460 --> 04:18:14,120
B1.

4155
04:18:14,400 --> 04:18:15,020
What's in here?

4156
04:18:16,800 --> 04:18:17,540
Supplies!

4157
04:18:18,200 --> 04:18:18,860
C4!

4158
04:18:19,060 --> 04:18:20,120
Oh, we got it so fast.

4159
04:18:20,960 --> 04:18:22,100
Okay, nice.

4160
04:18:24,440 --> 04:18:28,150
Is this the one?

4161
04:18:32,700 --> 04:18:33,720
Is this the one?

4162
04:18:40,020 --> 04:18:40,760
Ammunition.

4163
04:18:46,600 --> 04:18:48,800
No, this isn't west, this is east.

4164
04:18:49,840 --> 04:18:51,160
You need to go to the east wall.

4165
04:18:51,480 --> 04:18:51,640
What?

4166
04:18:51,900 --> 04:18:52,840
But I went to the right.

4167
04:18:56,300 --> 04:18:57,520
How would this...

4168
04:18:58,280 --> 04:18:59,620
This is the east wall.

4169
04:19:07,260 --> 04:19:08,720
Oh, I think it's...

4170
04:19:15,410 --> 04:19:15,770
C4.

4171
04:19:17,970 --> 04:19:19,550
B to set, A to detonate.

4172
04:19:19,770 --> 04:19:20,430
So this one, maybe.

4173
04:19:37,990 --> 04:19:38,630
That...

4174
04:19:41,480 --> 04:19:43,320
Did not work.

4175
04:19:46,450 --> 04:19:47,970
The furthest most wall?

4176
04:19:48,170 --> 04:19:48,390
Okay.

4177
04:19:55,740 --> 04:19:57,000
I'm glad no one showed up.

4178
04:19:57,680 --> 04:19:59,400
No one is doing their jobs around here.

4179
04:19:59,620 --> 04:20:00,240
It's kind of awesome.

4180
04:20:18,300 --> 04:20:20,880
Otacon's unused concept was Big Hacker.

4181
04:20:29,140 --> 04:20:30,860
Dude, what are you doing?

4182
04:20:48,570 --> 04:20:49,130
I'm...

4183
04:20:49,830 --> 04:20:50,390
I'm...

4184
04:20:59,570 --> 04:21:02,450
Oh my god, that's so silly.

4185
04:21:02,910 --> 04:21:04,550
That's actually...

4186
04:21:04,550 --> 04:21:06,610
That's actually so silly.

4187
04:21:08,310 --> 04:21:09,070
No way.

4188
04:21:13,310 --> 04:21:15,110
Oh, I can actually go through here, okay.

4189
04:21:15,650 --> 04:21:16,830
Okay, I get it, I get it.

4190
04:21:16,890 --> 04:21:17,370
Or wait...

4191
04:21:18,390 --> 04:21:18,850
Nope.

4192
04:21:20,430 --> 04:21:22,190
Okay, that's so funny.

4193
04:21:46,680 --> 04:21:48,760
Oh gosh, the music scared me for a second.

4194
04:21:51,880 --> 04:21:53,440
At the conveyor belt?

4195
04:21:53,660 --> 04:21:54,360
Ah, I see.

4196
04:21:55,160 --> 04:21:56,800
Ready for one more ride on the conveyor belt?

4197
04:21:56,920 --> 04:21:59,140
Wait, let me look at the guide.

4198
04:22:07,860 --> 04:22:09,780
Where do I stop though?

4199
04:22:14,120 --> 04:22:16,040
Conveyor belt brings you to the east wall.

4200
04:22:19,080 --> 04:22:21,120
I don't see where to stop though.

4201
04:22:23,320 --> 04:22:24,840
I apologize for mixing directions.

4202
04:22:25,020 --> 04:22:25,380
It's okay.

4203
04:22:26,840 --> 04:22:28,280
Where you got the thermal goggles?

4204
04:22:35,200 --> 04:22:37,700
Where I got the thermal goggles... Like I go...

4205
04:22:39,160 --> 04:22:39,880
Wait, huh?

4206
04:22:42,440 --> 04:22:43,920
Where the hell did that guy come from?

4207
04:22:51,020 --> 04:22:51,880
Thermal goggles?

4208
04:22:52,560 --> 04:22:53,020
Wait.

4209
04:22:55,060 --> 04:22:56,420
Oh, okay, down there.

4210
04:22:56,620 --> 04:22:57,420
Okay, okay, okay.

4211
04:22:57,420 --> 04:22:58,740
I see, I see.

4212
04:23:01,800 --> 04:23:03,600
Alright, let's wait for him to pass.

4213
04:23:07,080 --> 04:23:08,100
Okie dokie.

4214
04:23:15,380 --> 04:23:16,460
There he is.

4215
04:23:17,740 --> 04:23:18,640
Oh my god.

4216
04:23:20,860 --> 04:23:22,660
Oh gosh, that scared me.

4217
04:23:35,750 --> 04:23:37,310
I'll be here for a second.

4218
04:23:37,710 --> 04:23:39,270
And let them pass by again.

4219
04:23:40,310 --> 04:23:41,770
Close one, I know, right?

4220
04:23:41,770 --> 04:23:42,650
Okay, sheesh.

4221
04:23:42,770 --> 04:23:43,170
No!

4222
04:23:43,770 --> 04:23:44,730
Wait, maybe I can go.

4223
04:23:44,950 --> 04:23:45,130
Yeah.

4224
04:23:55,960 --> 04:23:57,680
Maybe I should have gone the other way.

4225
04:24:02,010 --> 04:24:02,970
That was close.

4226
04:24:04,270 --> 04:24:05,310
Oh wait, now I'm good.

4227
04:24:11,240 --> 04:24:14,720
I couldn't go down there, so yeah, I have to go...

4228
04:24:14,720 --> 04:24:15,940
I'm so confused.

4229
04:24:16,800 --> 04:24:17,400
Where should I go?

4230
04:24:22,790 --> 04:24:23,670
Thermal goggles.

4231
04:24:23,970 --> 04:24:25,090
Okay, thermal goggles.

4232
04:24:28,790 --> 04:24:29,830
Thermal goggles.

4233
04:24:30,170 --> 04:24:30,490
Wait.

4234
04:24:32,750 --> 04:24:34,630
I'm messing up, I'm messing up.

4235
04:24:35,510 --> 04:24:36,530
There we go.

4236
04:24:48,520 --> 04:24:50,140
Take your time, Minto.

4237
04:24:50,360 --> 04:24:50,820
Thank you.

4238
04:24:51,860 --> 04:24:52,960
Oh, I have it in my eyes.

4239
04:24:56,160 --> 04:24:57,860
So down here... wait.

4240
04:24:58,480 --> 04:24:59,480
I have to check again.

4241
04:25:00,380 --> 04:25:02,880
Thermal goggles is blue, red.

4242
04:25:04,800 --> 04:25:05,280
Blue.

4243
04:25:08,060 --> 04:25:09,000
And then red.

4244
04:25:10,520 --> 04:25:12,020
No, no, no, just kidding.

4245
04:25:12,120 --> 04:25:12,560
Sorry, blue.

4246
04:25:17,320 --> 04:25:19,200
Blue, and then red.

4247
04:25:21,420 --> 04:25:23,660
I'm trusting you guys, I'm trusting you guys.

4248
04:25:24,040 --> 04:25:25,380
It didn't tell me on my guide...

4249
04:25:26,160 --> 04:25:27,500
that I needed to go here for...

4250
04:25:28,920 --> 04:25:30,380
to blow up, so...

4251
04:25:31,240 --> 04:25:32,540
I'm trusting you guys.

4252
04:25:35,340 --> 04:25:38,800
I see, because... oh yes, there is the cameras.

4253
04:25:39,840 --> 04:25:41,680
I see, I see, I see, I see.

4254
04:25:42,340 --> 04:25:42,640
Okay.

4255
04:25:43,280 --> 04:25:43,880
Place.

4256
04:25:46,840 --> 04:25:47,520
Activate.

4257
04:25:54,010 --> 04:25:55,470
That took a while.

4258
04:25:59,470 --> 04:26:02,990
Are you really as great as you say you are?

4259
04:26:14,960 --> 04:26:15,640
Minutes!

4260
04:26:15,640 --> 04:26:16,880
Holy cow!

4261
04:26:19,400 --> 04:26:20,080
Jimmy!

4262
04:26:22,240 --> 04:26:24,620
Okay, get me out of this hole.

4263
04:26:26,200 --> 04:26:26,860
Terrible.

4264
04:26:27,860 --> 04:26:28,840
Not so fast.

4265
04:26:29,680 --> 04:26:32,240
First, tell me about Metal Gear.

4266
04:26:33,300 --> 04:26:35,400
He even got Otacon's hair.

4267
04:26:36,040 --> 04:26:37,400
Prototype Otacon.

4268
04:26:43,840 --> 04:26:45,880
I thought you were going to help me.

4269
04:26:47,140 --> 04:26:48,480
Talk first.

4270
04:26:50,000 --> 04:26:52,420
Well, that's just great.

4271
04:26:52,420 --> 04:26:55,520
You know Jimmy, you would be a lot more likeable...

4272
04:26:55,520 --> 04:26:57,460
if you didn't have this stinking attitude.

4273
04:27:00,560 --> 04:27:02,740
I can always leave you here.

4274
04:27:04,340 --> 04:27:06,560
Are you going to give me answers?

4275
04:27:09,160 --> 04:27:10,280
Alright, alright.

4276
04:27:10,600 --> 04:27:11,920
Ask away, will ya?

4277
04:27:13,420 --> 04:27:13,980
Daru?

4278
04:27:14,140 --> 04:27:17,300
No, Daru is a thousand times more handsome than this guy.

4279
04:27:17,380 --> 04:27:18,400
What are you talking about?

4280
04:27:19,740 --> 04:27:21,120
What are you talking about?

4281
04:27:21,120 --> 04:27:23,720
Where is Metal Gear, first of all?

4282
04:27:26,260 --> 04:27:27,600
In the maintenance base.

4283
04:27:28,820 --> 04:27:30,720
To the north of the first floor.

4284
04:27:31,540 --> 04:27:33,120
Wait, in the maintenance...

4285
04:27:33,940 --> 04:27:37,260
North of the first floor, northwest exit.

4286
04:27:37,360 --> 04:27:37,820
Okay, everybody.

4287
04:27:38,620 --> 04:27:40,560
First floor, northwest exit.

4288
04:27:42,100 --> 04:27:43,360
Of this barrack.

4289
04:27:43,880 --> 04:27:44,280
Barracks?

4290
04:27:45,640 --> 04:27:49,240
Okay, first floor, northwest exit of this building.

4291
04:27:49,240 --> 04:27:51,360
Then north.

4292
04:27:52,220 --> 04:27:54,020
Metal Gear's operational.

4293
04:27:57,080 --> 04:27:59,480
The assembly's done.

4294
04:28:01,480 --> 04:28:03,300
That's why I got locked up.

4295
04:28:08,380 --> 04:28:12,380
They're probably adjusting the power net now.

4296
04:28:15,400 --> 04:28:17,660
It's really nuclear capable.

4297
04:28:19,280 --> 04:28:21,680
Even snakes' boops and beeps are gravelly.

4298
04:28:21,780 --> 04:28:22,320
I know, right?

4299
04:28:22,340 --> 04:28:22,840
It's so good.

4300
04:28:23,360 --> 04:28:28,520
Yep, the South American trip was supposed to be for practical exercises.

4301
04:28:30,280 --> 04:28:32,600
Brought real nuclear warheads along.

4302
04:28:34,460 --> 04:28:35,160
That's crazy.

4303
04:28:35,840 --> 04:28:40,600
How could you be permitted to take a nuke out of the country?

4304
04:28:42,580 --> 04:28:47,900
Parker, the army chief of staff, is a big fan of the project.

4305
04:28:51,380 --> 04:28:53,300
The army's top brass?

4306
04:28:55,740 --> 04:28:59,860
Yeah, so we got all the funding we wanted.

4307
04:29:01,480 --> 04:29:03,820
And the project moved pretty quickly.

4308
04:29:06,700 --> 04:29:08,780
The army's top ass.

4309
04:29:08,780 --> 04:29:10,740
Ass with a B.

4310
04:29:12,560 --> 04:29:14,240
So why so much effort?

4311
04:29:15,540 --> 04:29:18,080
What were they planning to do with Metal Gear?

4312
04:29:19,800 --> 04:29:20,940
Project Bavel!

4313
04:29:34,670 --> 04:29:36,450
What is it?

4314
04:29:38,090 --> 04:29:40,830
It's some project of Parker's.

4315
04:29:42,450 --> 04:29:46,190
That's what Metal Gear's supposed to be... for.

4316
04:29:49,210 --> 04:29:50,370
What is it?

4317
04:29:52,070 --> 04:29:52,770
I don't know.

4318
04:29:53,110 --> 04:29:53,690
The details.

4319
04:29:55,530 --> 04:29:56,930
They wouldn't tell me.

4320
04:29:59,630 --> 04:30:02,190
Guys, this is pretty suspicious.

4321
04:30:02,950 --> 04:30:03,830
Not like I care.

4322
04:30:04,050 --> 04:30:08,690
I just want to be where I can make the best use of my talents.

4323
04:30:09,430 --> 04:30:15,350
You make weapons of war that can kill millions of people.

4324
04:30:15,970 --> 04:30:20,050
Kill millions... dot dot dot... of people.

4325
04:30:21,670 --> 04:30:23,490
Yeah, Snake, he could have been talking about anything.

4326
04:30:23,570 --> 04:30:29,150
Millions of fish, millions of snakes, millions of kittens.

4327
04:30:33,250 --> 04:30:35,630
Look what's happening right now.

4328
04:30:36,790 --> 04:30:39,810
That's to do with people who use them.

4329
04:30:40,430 --> 04:30:41,030
Not with me.

4330
04:30:41,510 --> 04:30:43,110
Not with Metal Gear itself.

4331
04:30:44,070 --> 04:30:46,930
What else is Metal Gear supposed to be used for?

4332
04:30:49,030 --> 04:30:51,970
I don't care what anyone says.

4333
04:30:52,970 --> 04:30:54,950
Metal Gear is a masterpiece.

4334
04:30:56,150 --> 04:30:57,770
Don't save this guy, right?

4335
04:30:57,950 --> 04:30:58,750
Jimmy Sykes!

4336
04:30:59,470 --> 04:31:02,950
The product of every technical genius I possess.

4337
04:31:03,950 --> 04:31:06,950
Nobody can build anything so...

4338
04:31:07,830 --> 04:31:10,030
What is it?

4339
04:31:10,890 --> 04:31:11,850
Power failure.

4340
04:31:12,730 --> 04:31:13,670
This could be bad.

4341
04:31:15,070 --> 04:31:15,750
Why?

4342
04:31:17,670 --> 04:31:19,970
They're going to go nuclear with Metal Gear.

4343
04:31:22,870 --> 04:31:23,410
What?

4344
04:31:25,210 --> 04:31:29,450
Metal Gear can launch warheads with a railgun.

4345
04:31:30,870 --> 04:31:33,450
Wow, sounds so familiar.

4346
04:31:35,110 --> 04:31:39,070
But the railgun has an enormous power consumption.

4347
04:31:40,770 --> 04:31:45,790
So they're charging the thing up with all the power they can get.

4348
04:31:46,130 --> 04:31:46,950
Who could have guessed?

4349
04:31:49,430 --> 04:31:49,950
Yeah.

4350
04:31:50,970 --> 04:31:53,090
Oh sorry, I think that was Snake saying it.

4351
04:31:54,690 --> 04:31:56,690
How long till full charge?

4352
04:31:57,690 --> 04:31:58,990
About 30 minutes!

4353
04:31:59,350 --> 04:32:02,030
Oh gosh, you guys, I only have 30 minutes to beat the stream.

4354
04:32:03,310 --> 04:32:05,890
30 minutes to a nuclear strike.

4355
04:32:10,760 --> 04:32:11,400
Colonel.

4356
04:32:12,260 --> 04:32:13,460
Oh, Chris.

4357
04:32:14,540 --> 04:32:15,380
Chris, come in.

4358
04:32:16,720 --> 04:32:17,360
Snake?

4359
04:32:17,740 --> 04:32:20,600
The power plant just went into overdrive.

4360
04:32:22,740 --> 04:32:23,480
What the hell?

4361
04:32:24,920 --> 04:32:26,300
No time to talk.

4362
04:32:26,300 --> 04:32:27,920
Then why'd you call, Snake?

4363
04:32:28,020 --> 04:32:30,200
I found the Metal Gear researcher.

4364
04:32:31,060 --> 04:32:34,520
I'd like you to take over his protection.

4365
04:32:34,880 --> 04:32:38,960
Okay, but what about you, Snake?

4366
04:32:41,600 --> 04:32:43,340
I'm going after Metal Gear.

4367
04:32:44,720 --> 04:32:45,620
Metal Gear?

4368
04:32:45,960 --> 04:32:47,160
What's going on?

4369
04:32:48,700 --> 04:32:49,960
There's no time.

4370
04:32:50,000 --> 04:32:51,760
Wait, she doesn't even know that Metal Gear is here?

4371
04:32:52,440 --> 04:32:57,160
I thought Project... I thought the Delta Force was supposed to be helping me.

4372
04:32:57,220 --> 04:32:58,780
I thought they don't even know that Metal Gear was here?

4373
04:32:59,600 --> 04:33:00,940
I'm counting on you.

4374
04:33:01,800 --> 04:33:02,280
Huh?

4375
04:33:03,300 --> 04:33:07,220
Oh my god, they already... they automatically put on the infrared.

4376
04:33:08,720 --> 04:33:13,640
Metal Gear is in a maintenance base to the north of this barrack, right?

4377
04:33:16,760 --> 04:33:17,720
Yeah, but...

4378
04:33:17,720 --> 04:33:18,400
No time to talk.

4379
04:33:18,520 --> 04:33:19,060
Begin tapping.

4380
04:33:19,060 --> 04:33:23,300
Wait a sec, what about me?

4381
04:33:26,260 --> 04:33:27,220
You stay here.

4382
04:33:28,540 --> 04:33:31,160
Hey, weren't you supposed to get me out?

4383
04:33:33,220 --> 04:33:37,380
Your new Delta Force bodyguard will be along shortly.

4384
04:33:38,620 --> 04:33:39,420
You'll like her.

4385
04:33:39,880 --> 04:33:40,400
She's hot.

4386
04:33:41,480 --> 04:33:43,700
What am I supposed to do alone?

4387
04:33:43,880 --> 04:33:45,860
Until then, what were you doing before?

4388
04:33:46,400 --> 04:33:47,880
Just chill, I don't know.

4389
04:33:49,740 --> 04:33:51,340
What are you, a kid?

4390
04:33:52,960 --> 04:33:54,200
Okay, okay.

4391
04:33:54,540 --> 04:33:58,380
Man, you really need to work on your... don't say social skills.

4392
04:33:58,880 --> 04:34:00,100
People skills!

4393
04:34:03,490 --> 04:34:05,570
Well, he didn't say social skills.

4394
04:34:08,250 --> 04:34:08,930
Snake,

4395
04:34:13,950 --> 04:34:15,950
put a stop to Metal Gear.

4396
04:34:16,610 --> 04:34:20,170
It seems to be to the north of where you are.

4397
04:34:20,170 --> 04:34:24,030
Get to the north of the barracks first.

4398
04:34:25,530 --> 04:34:26,210
Nice.

4399
04:34:26,670 --> 04:34:28,370
Oh, there's jamming even?

4400
04:34:28,690 --> 04:34:29,430
Oh no.

4401
04:34:31,070 --> 04:34:31,990
Okay, hold on.

4402
04:34:34,990 --> 04:34:35,670
Alright.

4403
04:34:39,670 --> 04:34:41,950
Brewed Coffee, welcome to Membo Show.

4404
04:34:42,490 --> 04:34:44,850
I guess I have to go this way.

4405
04:34:46,530 --> 04:34:50,510
I'm looking at my little guide map and I'm just going to say it.

4406
04:34:50,510 --> 04:34:55,730
It tells me to go where Marionette Owl is, which is one of the bosses.

4407
04:34:57,050 --> 04:35:01,050
So, do I go there or do I go to the first floor?

4408
04:35:03,790 --> 04:35:06,850
If you finish stage 5 without getting the IR goggles, Jimmy gives you a fare.

4409
04:35:08,850 --> 04:35:11,210
This game came out 2 years after MGS1.

4410
04:35:12,010 --> 04:35:13,830
Wait, it wasn't before Metal Gear Solid?

4411
04:35:14,750 --> 04:35:17,350
This has been an awful lot of Metal Gear ghost babbling.

4412
04:35:27,560 --> 04:35:28,240
Set before?

4413
04:35:28,260 --> 04:35:31,720
Oh, I always thought it was set before Metal Gear Solid when it came before.

4414
04:35:34,840 --> 04:35:36,380
It's just primitive because cartridge.

4415
04:35:37,780 --> 04:35:39,080
I never realized.

4416
04:35:39,740 --> 04:35:40,580
I never knew the date.

4417
04:35:44,340 --> 04:35:46,180
I wondered why you were saying prototype.

4418
04:35:46,400 --> 04:35:48,700
Yeah, because I was like, oh, this is...

4419
04:35:49,580 --> 04:35:50,340
That's my bad.

4420
04:35:50,440 --> 04:35:53,480
I assumed timeline equaled...

4421
04:35:56,920 --> 04:35:57,800
Equaled and...

4422
04:35:57,800 --> 04:35:58,340
What's the word?

4423
04:35:58,540 --> 04:35:58,880
You know.

4424
04:36:01,360 --> 04:36:02,200
Release date.

4425
04:36:04,920 --> 04:36:05,360
Wait.

4426
04:36:07,120 --> 04:36:10,220
Oh, I can just walk now.

4427
04:36:11,640 --> 04:36:12,580
Wait, where did I go?

4428
04:36:17,050 --> 04:36:18,150
Can I save her?

4429
04:36:19,530 --> 04:36:20,730
Oh, this is sleepy guy.

4430
04:36:21,350 --> 04:36:22,350
He's still sleepy.

4431
04:36:22,810 --> 04:36:24,370
Good thing the lights are off for him now.

4432
04:36:37,830 --> 04:36:39,610
Oh gosh, this is gonna be tricky.

4433
04:36:40,790 --> 04:36:44,590
So I'm assuming the power is out so the cameras don't work.

4434
04:36:44,770 --> 04:36:46,010
Yeah, look at that.

4435
04:36:46,690 --> 04:36:48,390
Okay, what floor are we on?

4436
04:36:51,770 --> 04:36:52,890
Oh, no way.

4437
04:36:53,130 --> 04:36:53,550
How?

4438
04:36:53,970 --> 04:36:54,890
How the hell?

4439
04:36:55,150 --> 04:36:55,990
Oh my god, please.

4440
04:36:57,630 --> 04:36:58,390
Oh, wait.

4441
04:36:59,610 --> 04:37:00,730
I didn't mean to do that.

4442
04:37:04,040 --> 04:37:05,440
Wait, there we go.

4443
04:37:07,180 --> 04:37:07,980
Do you think they'll see me?

4444
04:37:12,650 --> 04:37:14,310
They all have thermal goggles?

4445
04:37:14,650 --> 04:37:15,330
Messed up.

4446
04:37:16,250 --> 04:37:18,010
He saw me so fast too.

4447
04:37:18,790 --> 04:37:19,950
So, so fast.

4448
04:37:21,270 --> 04:37:22,610
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

4449
04:37:22,910 --> 04:37:24,930
It's jammed so I can't tell.

4450
04:37:30,730 --> 04:37:32,350
I'm just gonna...

4451
04:37:36,040 --> 04:37:39,720
I'm just gonna chill in my box until maybe the people that...

4452
04:37:40,880 --> 04:37:41,300
Okay.

4453
04:37:42,080 --> 04:37:43,060
Alright, let's see now.

4454
04:37:56,360 --> 04:37:56,680
Snake!

4455
04:37:57,000 --> 04:37:57,540
Snake, run.

4456
04:37:58,480 --> 04:37:58,800
Snake!

4457
04:37:58,880 --> 04:38:01,240
Oh my god, this guy is a maniac.

4458
04:38:05,090 --> 04:38:05,890
Oh, thank god.

4459
04:38:10,270 --> 04:38:12,190
Oh wait, the elevator is not gonna work.

4460
04:38:12,270 --> 04:38:13,590
Okay, so we need to go to the northwest.

4461
04:38:15,390 --> 04:38:16,350
Where I was.

4462
04:38:16,970 --> 04:38:17,910
I didn't need to go...

4463
04:38:18,290 --> 04:38:18,610
Wait.

4464
04:38:19,330 --> 04:38:20,210
What's the map of...

4465
04:38:20,210 --> 04:38:21,830
I don't know the map of this place.

4466
04:38:24,450 --> 04:38:24,770
Okay.

4467
04:38:26,230 --> 04:38:27,290
Maybe save the game.

4468
04:38:27,410 --> 04:38:28,130
You know what, you're right.

4469
04:38:30,630 --> 04:38:31,310
Mailing!

4470
04:38:35,980 --> 04:38:37,040
Need anything?

4471
04:38:40,010 --> 04:38:45,250
They say you can't be in two places at the same time.

4472
04:38:45,950 --> 04:38:50,970
If Mito keeps getting the terrible rank, then we know why the game is called Ghost Babe L.

4473
04:38:53,250 --> 04:38:56,530
But if we see a higher rank, is it Ghost Babe W?

4474
04:38:58,030 --> 04:38:58,630
Yeah!

4475
04:38:59,890 --> 04:39:00,970
For west.

4476
04:39:02,450 --> 04:39:05,650
You can't do two things at the same time.

4477
04:39:06,190 --> 04:39:06,790
Either.

4478
04:39:07,790 --> 04:39:12,710
You're not doing something else while you play this game.

4479
04:39:12,970 --> 04:39:13,630
Are you?

4480
04:39:18,080 --> 04:39:19,320
No, I'm not...

4481
04:39:19,320 --> 04:39:20,120
I mean, I'm...

4482
04:39:20,840 --> 04:39:22,480
Streaming doesn't really count, right?

4483
04:39:22,640 --> 04:39:23,640
Like, it's different.

4484
04:39:24,220 --> 04:39:24,620
Right.

4485
04:39:42,540 --> 04:39:45,020
Okay, please, please don't let that guy be here.

4486
04:39:45,940 --> 04:39:46,680
Oh, thank god.

4487
04:39:46,820 --> 04:39:47,060
Okay.

4488
04:39:48,280 --> 04:39:49,560
He's gonna come by.

4489
04:39:50,380 --> 04:39:51,620
He's gonna pass.

4490
04:39:52,120 --> 04:39:52,840
Okay, here we go.

4491
04:40:05,490 --> 04:40:07,470
This counts as northwest, right?

4492
04:40:09,870 --> 04:40:11,530
Even in the dark they're patrolling.

4493
04:40:11,650 --> 04:40:13,010
They're too married to their jobs.

4494
04:40:16,550 --> 04:40:17,770
Wait, oh, this is...

4495
04:40:17,770 --> 04:40:18,850
Oh, this is this room.

4496
04:40:20,630 --> 04:40:22,830
I think I need to go down here?

4497
04:40:24,310 --> 04:40:25,170
Oh, gosh.

4498
04:40:25,170 --> 04:40:25,250
Oh, gosh.

4499
04:40:31,600 --> 04:40:34,000
I think I'm gonna have to box it.

4500
04:40:36,420 --> 04:40:37,540
No, please.

4501
04:40:53,820 --> 04:40:55,980
Three, two, one.

4502
04:41:16,370 --> 04:41:20,910
Honestly, I feel like I should just knock this guy out, but I think he'll wake up too fast.

4503
04:41:21,930 --> 04:41:24,010
For me to crawl around...

4504
04:41:24,010 --> 04:41:24,970
Crawl away.

4505
04:41:26,710 --> 04:41:29,390
I wonder if you can go on the conveyor belts now.

4506
04:41:30,250 --> 04:41:31,710
Oh, like walk on them.

4507
04:41:31,810 --> 04:41:35,390
I was able to before I fell down the hole, so...

4508
04:41:36,310 --> 04:41:38,750
I'm assuming I'd be able to do the rest of them too.

4509
04:41:41,910 --> 04:41:43,330
Gosh, this part is so evil.

4510
04:41:44,170 --> 04:41:46,210
I'm scared this guy's gonna see me down here.

4511
04:41:49,330 --> 04:41:51,910
I can't see him, so I don't know where he is.

4512
04:41:54,990 --> 04:41:55,870
Oh, there he is.

4513
04:42:01,260 --> 04:42:03,540
And you can't tell which direction they're facing.

4514
04:42:04,740 --> 04:42:05,480
The most evil.

4515
04:42:06,740 --> 04:42:07,660
Alright, okay.

4516
04:42:09,700 --> 04:42:10,800
Okay, nice.

4517
04:42:12,380 --> 04:42:13,400
Nice, nice, nice.

4518
04:42:16,120 --> 04:42:17,940
This guy doesn't go up, does he?

4519
04:42:18,360 --> 04:42:20,800
I think he goes right to the... or to the left.

4520
04:42:22,180 --> 04:42:23,820
There we go, yeah.

4521
04:42:50,850 --> 04:42:51,370
Neon!

4522
04:42:55,930 --> 04:42:56,530
Box it.

4523
04:42:59,290 --> 04:43:00,590
And now we pray.

4524
04:43:01,630 --> 04:43:04,150
Let's count down from ten.

4525
04:43:04,850 --> 04:43:06,270
Oh, I just saw him walk by!

4526
04:43:06,670 --> 04:43:07,010
Just kidding!

4527
04:43:12,020 --> 04:43:12,440
Cool.

4528
04:43:17,170 --> 04:43:19,690
Why do the doors not work?

4529
04:43:22,650 --> 04:43:23,370
If...

4530
04:43:23,370 --> 04:43:24,750
Okay, now we go up.

4531
04:43:28,550 --> 04:43:30,430
Wait, is this wrong?

4532
04:43:32,330 --> 04:43:34,250
No, I need to be on the first... wait, what?

4533
04:43:34,370 --> 04:43:35,290
I'm so confused.

4534
04:43:36,410 --> 04:43:38,090
Oh, I think I need to go...

4535
04:43:49,200 --> 04:43:51,680
Wait, floor one instead of...

4536
04:43:54,580 --> 04:43:57,040
Instead of... was that considered the basement?

4537
04:44:04,890 --> 04:44:05,850
I see.

4538
04:44:20,990 --> 04:44:22,750
That's why I was so confused.

4539
04:44:28,700 --> 04:44:30,560
Now go to the far left, yeah.

4540
04:44:35,420 --> 04:44:38,360
I don't remember where the people are in this area, though.

4541
04:44:39,220 --> 04:44:42,000
I don't remember where they are, so it's gonna be a little freaky.

4542
04:44:43,380 --> 04:44:47,140
I remember a guy walks down here, but...

4543
04:44:47,140 --> 04:44:51,980
Oh, this is giving me such a tummy ache.

4544
04:44:52,080 --> 04:44:52,820
Oh my gosh, you guys.

4545
04:45:02,670 --> 04:45:04,230
Is this the guy that turns around?

4546
04:45:06,170 --> 04:45:07,330
When he's like walking by?

4547
04:45:26,050 --> 04:45:28,550
The cameras don't work though now, which is good.

4548
04:45:35,510 --> 04:45:37,110
So we don't have to worry about that.

4549
04:45:40,270 --> 04:45:41,530
What you doing, huh?

4550
04:45:42,370 --> 04:45:43,550
What you doing, huh?

4551
04:45:44,410 --> 04:45:45,010
We dancing?

4552
04:45:58,730 --> 04:46:02,170
Oh gosh, are you kidding me right now?

4553
04:46:02,610 --> 04:46:04,050
No way.

4554
04:46:06,230 --> 04:46:08,310
No way, how am I supposed to...

4555
04:46:09,530 --> 04:46:10,010
Well,

4556
04:46:20,270 --> 04:46:20,870
I did it.

4557
04:46:20,950 --> 04:46:21,390
Nevermind.

4558
04:46:23,330 --> 04:46:24,630
How am I supposed to?

4559
04:46:24,930 --> 04:46:25,690
Just like that.

4560
04:46:30,860 --> 04:46:32,100
Do I like crawl through?

4561
04:46:32,380 --> 04:46:32,900
Oh, yep.

4562
04:46:35,560 --> 04:46:36,540
Okay, cool.

4563
04:46:37,580 --> 04:46:40,720
We can't get off, but... Wait, can I go like up?

4564
04:46:40,820 --> 04:46:41,860
Oh, okay, hold on.

4565
04:46:42,180 --> 04:46:43,540
So we're going to the...

4566
04:46:45,360 --> 04:46:46,580
Which way does this go to?

4567
04:46:50,960 --> 04:46:53,420
Yeah, moonwalk, moonwalk, moonwalk.

4568
04:46:58,850 --> 04:46:59,870
What's fine?

4569
04:47:00,730 --> 04:47:01,530
What is that?

4570
04:47:03,070 --> 04:47:06,150
I don't know where... Okay, I think this leads to the storeroom.

4571
04:47:08,730 --> 04:47:09,910
Okay, nice.

4572
04:47:16,160 --> 04:47:18,360
Hold on, I'm going to reset it.

4573
04:47:36,960 --> 04:47:38,840
Yeah, this is Metal Gear, guys.

4574
04:47:40,480 --> 04:47:42,020
This is Metal Gear.

4575
04:47:55,840 --> 04:47:56,160
Chris!

4576
04:47:56,900 --> 04:47:59,200
Snake, I've got Jimmy.

4577
04:47:59,520 --> 04:48:00,680
Oh good, kill him!

4578
04:48:02,220 --> 04:48:03,420
Everything alright?

4579
04:48:04,720 --> 04:48:05,660
Is Jimmy okay?

4580
04:48:07,980 --> 04:48:10,340
Yes, he's not injured or anything.

4581
04:48:12,720 --> 04:48:14,680
I thought we were watching Donkey Kong.

4582
04:48:15,760 --> 04:48:17,680
Yeah, he's going up the...

4583
04:48:20,320 --> 04:48:22,780
What building did Rose say he goes up?

4584
04:48:27,120 --> 04:48:29,840
He seems to have been keeping out of sight well.

4585
04:48:30,600 --> 04:48:32,260
Well, it's dark, so I hope, but...

4586
04:48:33,600 --> 04:48:34,260
But what?

4587
04:48:35,880 --> 04:48:39,100
This kid's a real pain in the butt.

4588
04:48:40,780 --> 04:48:44,880
Oh, Jimmy, did you say something?

4589
04:48:45,360 --> 04:48:46,580
Oh, Jimmy!

4590
04:48:49,660 --> 04:48:51,080
Oh, Jimmy!

4591
04:48:55,820 --> 04:48:56,700
No, nothing.

4592
04:48:58,580 --> 04:49:00,560
Liar, I heard you.

4593
04:49:01,920 --> 04:49:03,980
You're the one who's a pain.

4594
04:49:04,640 --> 04:49:08,420
Telling me what to do all the time.

4595
04:49:09,180 --> 04:49:10,480
What do you think you are?

4596
04:49:10,520 --> 04:49:11,140
My mom?

4597
04:49:11,200 --> 04:49:11,320
I

4598
04:49:16,240 --> 04:49:24,360
wouldn't want to be your mom even if someone paid me to do it.

4599
04:49:25,020 --> 04:49:30,300
She wishes she never would give birth to you, Jimmy.

4600
04:49:30,820 --> 04:49:31,920
Excuse me!

4601
04:49:34,160 --> 04:49:34,340
Nothing.

4602
04:49:34,760 --> 04:49:38,400
Look, I'm in the middle of a conversation.

4603
04:49:39,120 --> 04:49:41,300
Do you mind shutting up?

4604
04:49:43,340 --> 04:49:45,000
The worst she can say is no.

4605
04:49:45,280 --> 04:49:51,020
The worst she can say is if I were your mother, I would regret giving birth to you.

4606
04:49:53,660 --> 04:49:55,260
Shut up yourself.

4607
04:49:56,440 --> 04:49:59,240
You've got a real attitude problem.

4608
04:49:59,920 --> 04:50:01,080
You know that?

4609
04:50:01,680 --> 04:50:09,780
It's just going to make things more difficult for you as a woman in the military.

4610
04:50:11,040 --> 04:50:11,440
Jimmy!

4611
04:50:12,420 --> 04:50:12,820
Jimmy!

4612
04:50:15,640 --> 04:50:16,240
Muzzle it!

4613
04:50:18,320 --> 04:50:20,180
You shut up when I tell you to shut up!

4614
04:50:20,240 --> 04:50:21,940
Oh, I want to put Jimmy through the military.

4615
04:50:22,360 --> 04:50:22,820
You know what, Jimmy?

4616
04:50:22,980 --> 04:50:26,700
You wouldn't even be able to get through one day of basic...

4617
04:50:26,700 --> 04:50:30,240
Not even one day, like one hour of basic training.

4618
04:50:32,460 --> 04:50:33,260
Sorry, Snake.

4619
04:50:34,180 --> 04:50:35,120
Why did you call?

4620
04:50:35,300 --> 04:50:36,580
Oh yeah, because you found him.

4621
04:50:37,060 --> 04:50:38,720
Glad to hear you two are getting along.

4622
04:50:41,160 --> 04:50:44,540
Ha, I never thought I'd be babysitting... again.

4623
04:50:46,060 --> 04:50:47,420
Especially... under fire.

4624
04:50:48,820 --> 04:50:50,900
But I guess it's like riding a bike.

4625
04:50:51,620 --> 04:50:54,420
Yeah, Jimmy, if you were so smart, you wouldn't have been in jail, okay?

4626
04:50:54,840 --> 04:50:56,020
This guy is so stupid.

4627
04:50:58,200 --> 04:50:59,380
That's what I'm counting on.

4628
04:51:01,300 --> 04:51:01,780
Okay.

4629
04:51:03,400 --> 04:51:06,160
Oh gosh, hopefully there's nobody over here.

4630
04:51:08,940 --> 04:51:09,340
Uh...

4631
04:51:11,680 --> 04:51:12,880
Let's use my rations.

4632
04:51:14,860 --> 04:51:15,440
Oh no.

4633
04:51:16,300 --> 04:51:17,080
Yeah, there we go.

4634
04:51:20,180 --> 04:51:20,580
Yay!

4635
04:51:21,240 --> 04:51:23,580
Okay, back to glasses.

4636
04:51:25,080 --> 04:51:25,760
Oh my god!

4637
04:51:25,920 --> 04:51:26,420
Oh my god!

4638
04:51:26,520 --> 04:51:27,080
Oh my god!

4639
04:51:27,440 --> 04:51:28,780
Oh my god!

4640
04:51:28,840 --> 04:51:29,120
Oh my god!

4641
04:51:29,260 --> 04:51:29,400
Oh my god!

4642
04:51:29,420 --> 04:51:29,480
Oh my god!

4643
04:51:29,540 --> 04:51:30,880
Oh my god!

4644
04:51:31,340 --> 04:51:31,640
Oh my god!

4645
04:51:34,860 --> 04:51:36,520
Okay, I guess I...

4646
04:51:38,520 --> 04:51:39,860
Okay, let's just go.

4647
04:51:41,840 --> 04:51:43,200
Scared the hell out of me.

4648
04:51:45,060 --> 04:51:45,960
Here we go.

4649
04:51:48,600 --> 04:51:49,560
Oh, crap.

4650
04:51:49,860 --> 04:51:50,740
Wait, which way do I go?

4651
04:52:05,930 --> 04:52:07,170
Have I been here before?

4652
04:52:07,630 --> 04:52:08,550
Oh gosh, I don't know.

4653
04:52:32,240 --> 04:52:32,720
No...

4654
04:52:34,860 --> 04:52:35,340
Okay.

4655
04:52:35,340 --> 04:52:35,620
Okay.

4656
04:52:44,140 --> 04:52:45,240
Radar is evil.

4657
04:52:45,480 --> 04:52:48,580
Okay, hold on, before we go there...

4658
04:52:48,580 --> 04:52:49,900
Is there anything up here?

4659
04:52:50,140 --> 04:52:51,140
This is where we came from.

4660
04:52:52,140 --> 04:52:52,620
Oh!

4661
04:52:53,380 --> 04:52:56,940
Wait, so we can either go down...

4662
04:52:58,000 --> 04:52:59,440
I guess let's go down.

4663
04:53:15,860 --> 04:53:16,340
Wait.

4664
04:53:17,240 --> 04:53:18,000
Okay, this one.

4665
04:53:24,600 --> 04:53:25,080
Alright.

4666
04:53:26,380 --> 04:53:28,160
Don't know where we're going, but...

4667
04:53:28,160 --> 04:53:31,380
Okay, maybe...

4668
04:53:33,660 --> 04:53:34,180
Change!

4669
04:53:34,600 --> 04:53:35,020
Nice.

4670
04:53:35,300 --> 04:53:35,520
Okay.

4671
04:53:36,200 --> 04:53:36,640
Next.

4672
04:53:37,280 --> 04:53:38,180
Change.

4673
04:53:39,080 --> 04:53:39,800
Next.

4674
04:53:40,540 --> 04:53:41,460
Change.

4675
04:53:42,980 --> 04:53:43,300
Bye bye.

4676
04:53:54,150 --> 04:53:55,790
Night visions!

4677
04:53:56,930 --> 04:53:58,070
Night visions.

4678
04:54:00,930 --> 04:54:03,250
So that's what they're called.

4679
04:54:04,070 --> 04:54:07,570
The things... The shadows I see in the corners of my eyes.

4680
04:54:08,270 --> 04:54:10,770
Equip to see even in dark areas.

4681
04:54:11,670 --> 04:54:13,310
Is that not what we're doing right now?

4682
04:54:15,110 --> 04:54:17,750
Alright guys, maybe we'll have better visions now.

4683
04:54:18,490 --> 04:54:20,790
Oh my gosh, everything is...

4684
04:54:20,790 --> 04:54:21,130
Wow!

4685
04:54:22,190 --> 04:54:23,570
It's... Oh my gosh, we're...

4686
04:54:24,590 --> 04:54:26,800
It's like... Oh my gosh, why do I keep yelling...

4687
04:54:27,110 --> 04:54:27,950
Or laying down?

4688
04:54:28,430 --> 04:54:30,530
It's like we're... We're a dog.

4689
04:54:31,070 --> 04:54:32,630
We're not a dog anymore, I mean.

4690
04:54:34,330 --> 04:54:35,810
We have the night visions.

4691
04:54:37,090 --> 04:54:40,870
Oh, well, that doesn't help me here very much now, does it?

4692
04:54:42,750 --> 04:54:44,490
Okay, back to thermal.

4693
04:54:45,350 --> 04:54:46,830
Okay, great.

4694
04:54:47,830 --> 04:54:49,350
Thanks for the night visions.

4695
04:54:50,690 --> 04:54:52,850
Oh, I don't want to risk it.

4696
04:54:55,690 --> 04:54:57,130
Was there anything over here?

4697
04:54:59,410 --> 04:55:00,430
Why back?

4698
04:55:00,650 --> 04:55:01,270
Was there a door?

4699
04:55:09,250 --> 04:55:10,650
Top right has rations.

4700
04:55:11,970 --> 04:55:12,650
And here?

4701
04:55:16,220 --> 04:55:19,440
Oh, I have... I have full rations, so...

4702
04:55:21,680 --> 04:55:24,120
At least cutscenes won't be in white and red, yeah.

4703
04:55:24,800 --> 04:55:25,200
True!

4704
04:55:27,420 --> 04:55:29,420
Okay, so now we go upstairs.

4705
04:55:33,100 --> 04:55:33,940
Night visions.

4706
04:55:34,500 --> 04:55:38,000
We can at least see which way guards are facing now too, which is nice.

4707
04:55:41,740 --> 04:55:45,860
It shows that the cameras are still on, but I guess not, actually.

4708
04:55:46,620 --> 04:55:47,400
It's a lie.

4709
04:55:47,700 --> 04:55:49,020
Okay, now we go upstairs.

4710
04:55:51,400 --> 04:55:51,960
Oh.

4711
04:55:56,120 --> 04:55:57,380
Where does this go to?

4712
04:56:09,940 --> 04:56:10,940
That's a hole.

4713
04:56:12,740 --> 04:56:13,920
This is a hole.

4714
04:56:19,360 --> 04:56:21,380
And then this leads to...

4715
04:56:23,600 --> 04:56:25,120
Another hole!

4716
04:56:38,720 --> 04:56:39,700
Which hole?

4717
04:56:40,220 --> 04:56:41,720
But we can't get to the third hole.

4718
04:57:01,920 --> 04:57:02,120
Go?

4719
04:57:07,500 --> 04:57:09,220
Need our codec.

4720
04:57:09,520 --> 04:57:11,120
I'm lost!

4721
04:57:12,680 --> 04:57:13,880
I'm lost.

4722
04:57:16,560 --> 04:57:17,840
Campbell, help me.

4723
04:57:18,180 --> 04:57:19,040
Where do I go?

4724
04:57:21,060 --> 04:57:23,860
The sorting device is off too.

4725
04:57:24,860 --> 04:57:27,540
You should be able to crawl under it.

4726
04:57:35,180 --> 04:57:38,520
He's about as useful as he is in Metal Gear Solid.

4727
04:58:18,750 --> 04:58:20,610
This guy does no help.

4728
04:58:23,790 --> 04:58:24,330
Is

4729
04:58:37,410 --> 04:58:38,370
it a keycard?

4730
04:58:38,550 --> 04:58:39,810
No, that's not the problem.

4731
04:58:39,950 --> 04:58:41,610
The problem is I don't know where to go.

4732
04:58:42,990 --> 04:58:45,790
There's two doors with the keycard.

4733
04:58:49,950 --> 04:58:51,650
I don't know what to do.

4734
04:59:00,130 --> 04:59:00,370
What?

4735
04:59:00,750 --> 04:59:00,930
Oh.

4736
04:59:03,190 --> 04:59:03,730
Oh.

4737
04:59:04,710 --> 04:59:07,110
Welcome to the darkness, Solid Snake.

4738
04:59:09,050 --> 04:59:10,250
Who's there?

4739
04:59:12,670 --> 04:59:14,750
We made it to her!

4740
04:59:17,570 --> 04:59:20,530
I see you've put your night sights on.

4741
04:59:23,650 --> 04:59:26,210
Oh my gosh, she's so cool!

4742
04:59:27,550 --> 04:59:31,990
I can see you fine without depending on those toys.

4743
04:59:31,990 --> 04:59:37,670
My night vision is as good as an owl's.

4744
04:59:38,010 --> 04:59:39,750
She's so cool!

4745
04:59:41,150 --> 04:59:52,710
The face of my prey in the darkness, overcome with terror and pain, no machine should contaminate a moment of such exquisite pleasure.

4746
04:59:55,510 --> 04:59:58,410
Are you one of this black chamber group?

4747
05:00:00,050 --> 05:00:04,410
Of course, I am called Marionette Owl.

4748
05:00:05,630 --> 05:00:12,110
My flair for nocturnal combat has no equal even among the black chamber.

4749
05:00:13,770 --> 05:00:18,410
The party is about to begin, but you won't be making it.

4750
05:00:23,360 --> 05:00:26,420
You'll die here, in the darkness.

4751
05:00:28,260 --> 05:00:29,020
Alright.

4752
05:00:30,640 --> 05:00:32,880
Let me introduce you to my partners.

4753
05:00:33,500 --> 05:00:34,660
Oh, they're like little geishas.

4754
05:00:35,140 --> 05:00:36,140
This is Osan.

4755
05:00:36,900 --> 05:00:37,300
Cute!

4756
05:00:38,160 --> 05:00:39,680
And Kohal.

4757
05:00:41,900 --> 05:00:45,220
I have no time for you or your dolls.

4758
05:00:47,400 --> 05:00:51,720
A doll is an approximation of the human form.

4759
05:00:51,720 --> 05:00:56,080
And a good doll is endowed with a soul.

4760
05:00:57,460 --> 05:00:58,220
Kohal?

4761
05:00:58,380 --> 05:00:59,320
I wish.

4762
05:00:59,940 --> 05:01:03,100
What nice lines your clavicles have, Snake.

4763
05:01:04,620 --> 05:01:08,020
Not a bad heft to your femurs either.

4764
05:01:09,420 --> 05:01:12,220
When you're dead, Kohal will have those.

4765
05:01:13,500 --> 05:01:14,700
It's kind of awesome.

4766
05:01:15,400 --> 05:01:16,720
Time to die.

4767
05:01:23,540 --> 05:01:25,260
I want to save real quick.

4768
05:01:25,300 --> 05:01:25,560
Sorry.

4769
05:01:29,100 --> 05:01:30,800
Snake, are you alright?

4770
05:01:31,900 --> 05:01:32,480
No.

4771
05:01:34,240 --> 05:01:36,460
Snake, come back to us safely.

4772
05:01:36,900 --> 05:01:37,040
Ok.

4773
05:01:42,080 --> 05:01:42,660
Wait.

4774
05:01:46,660 --> 05:01:47,640
Oh my God.

4775
05:01:47,980 --> 05:01:48,500
Oh my God.

4776
05:01:48,820 --> 05:01:49,620
Oh God.

4777
05:01:52,500 --> 05:01:54,140
Is thermal better here?

4778
05:01:54,400 --> 05:01:54,720
Nope.

4779
05:01:54,860 --> 05:01:55,100
Ok.

4780
05:01:55,400 --> 05:01:55,940
Nothing.

4781
05:01:56,420 --> 05:01:57,060
No item.

4782
05:01:58,400 --> 05:01:58,960
No?

4783
05:01:59,220 --> 05:01:59,680
Ok.

4784
05:02:00,140 --> 05:02:00,720
Just kidding.

4785
05:02:11,610 --> 05:02:12,530
Oh my God.

4786
05:02:18,370 --> 05:02:20,110
Oh my God, this is horrible.

4787
05:02:23,680 --> 05:02:26,980
And having no items does nothing because it's just a flashbang.

4788
05:02:27,120 --> 05:02:28,280
Like, it doesn't help.

4789
05:02:31,320 --> 05:02:32,180
Oh my God.

4790
05:02:32,320 --> 05:02:33,260
Stop, please!

4791
05:02:37,750 --> 05:02:38,650
Oh my God.

4792
05:02:41,030 --> 05:02:43,610
If you use... Oh, if you use thermal, she'll... Ok.

4793
05:02:47,840 --> 05:02:49,420
I see, you can't tell who's who.

4794
05:02:50,260 --> 05:02:51,200
Oh, that's kind of fun though.

4795
05:02:51,280 --> 05:02:51,980
At least I can see.

4796
05:02:52,660 --> 05:02:53,420
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

4797
05:02:53,980 --> 05:02:54,740
Oh, ouchie, ouchie.

4798
05:03:00,670 --> 05:03:01,670
Oh, and then they get faster?

4799
05:03:03,110 --> 05:03:05,870
Am I killing her or... Am I getting lucky?

4800
05:03:10,600 --> 05:03:11,140
Oh, ok.

4801
05:03:14,420 --> 05:03:15,160
Alright.

4802
05:03:15,540 --> 05:03:19,240
Hold on, I want to use an item real quick.

4803
05:03:19,380 --> 05:03:21,280
I want to use my...

4804
05:03:23,060 --> 05:03:23,780
aggression.

4805
05:03:30,200 --> 05:03:30,680
Thermal.

4806
05:03:36,960 --> 05:03:38,800
I'll kill... you?

4807
05:03:41,050 --> 05:03:42,540
That wasn't very bad.

4808
05:03:43,540 --> 05:03:44,280
I

4809
05:03:48,520 --> 05:03:49,760
got a whole speech!

4810
05:03:53,920 --> 05:03:55,480
That wasn't so bad at all.

4811
05:03:56,160 --> 05:03:57,140
Oh, ok, here we go.

4812
05:03:57,200 --> 05:03:58,740
Oh my God, she's so beautiful.

4813
05:03:59,460 --> 05:04:03,020
Snake, do you know what madness tastes like?

4814
05:04:07,620 --> 05:04:08,220
Terrible!

4815
05:04:12,640 --> 05:04:16,080
When I was 12, Laura was murdered.

4816
05:04:16,220 --> 05:04:16,900
Ooh, Laura.

4817
05:04:18,100 --> 05:04:19,640
By some madman.

4818
05:04:20,100 --> 05:04:20,700
A psycho.

4819
05:04:22,000 --> 05:04:25,260
And I was the one who found her.

4820
05:04:28,760 --> 05:04:30,900
Scattered all over the field.

4821
05:04:32,500 --> 05:04:34,360
Just for the record, this is canonically a guy.

4822
05:04:34,460 --> 05:04:34,980
Oh, really?

4823
05:04:35,400 --> 05:04:36,400
Oh, my bad.

4824
05:04:37,420 --> 05:04:38,160
Sorry, owl.

4825
05:04:39,260 --> 05:04:41,420
Well, you're still... Owl is still beautiful.

4826
05:04:43,580 --> 05:04:46,780
Laura's white hands, thighs, dark entrails.

4827
05:04:47,600 --> 05:04:53,100
That image was burned into the back of my eyes.

4828
05:04:53,980 --> 05:04:57,220
Even now, in my sleep every night.

4829
05:04:58,760 --> 05:05:02,600
In that moment, something snapped inside me.

4830
05:05:03,880 --> 05:05:05,760
These dramatic pauses are killing me.

4831
05:05:06,280 --> 05:05:08,260
Taken over by a strange compulsion.

4832
05:05:09,360 --> 05:05:13,660
And soon I found myself called a serial killer, too.

4833
05:05:15,120 --> 05:05:16,720
I loved those women.

4834
05:05:17,120 --> 05:05:17,360
Why?

4835
05:05:17,520 --> 05:05:18,940
We should, you know, like...

4836
05:05:19,520 --> 05:05:24,900
For, like, beautiful men, why did we stop using the term Bishounen, you know?

4837
05:05:27,140 --> 05:05:30,660
Why did that term get, like, lost in time?

4838
05:05:30,920 --> 05:05:32,700
It used to be so, like...

4839
05:05:32,700 --> 05:05:36,140
You would hear it all the time in, like...

4840
05:05:36,140 --> 05:05:38,160
The mid-2000s and stuff.

4841
05:05:38,640 --> 05:05:42,240
A bishi, yeah, everyone would be like, oh my god, Sephiroth, he's such a bishi!

4842
05:05:42,920 --> 05:05:43,300
You know?

4843
05:05:43,540 --> 05:05:45,260
But, like, Bishounen...

4844
05:05:45,260 --> 05:05:47,840
The term has kind of been lost, I feel.

4845
05:05:49,640 --> 05:05:50,740
Was it stopped?

4846
05:05:50,740 --> 05:05:57,180
I just don't see so many people using it as often as it used to be, I feel like.

4847
05:05:59,080 --> 05:06:01,100
I guess Ikemen really took over.

4848
05:06:01,200 --> 05:06:01,960
I guess so.

4849
05:06:02,620 --> 05:06:08,600
But Ikemen, I feel like Bishounen and Ikemen, to me at least, feel like they have different vibes.

4850
05:06:08,720 --> 05:06:12,600
Like, Ikemen is like, I feel, just like a generally attractive dude.

4851
05:06:13,100 --> 05:06:16,040
But Bishounen is like a beautiful, you know, it's...

4852
05:06:16,040 --> 05:06:17,920
You have the B, the...

4853
05:06:17,920 --> 05:06:19,700
The beautiful part of it.

4854
05:06:21,320 --> 05:06:23,620
What does madness taste like?

4855
05:06:24,520 --> 05:06:25,040
Watermelon.

4856
05:06:28,060 --> 05:06:29,820
Ikemen feels more specific.

4857
05:06:30,080 --> 05:06:31,100
Actually, I feel like it's different.

4858
05:06:31,220 --> 05:06:33,140
I feel like Ikemen is more vague.

4859
05:06:33,720 --> 05:06:35,200
Ikemen is more handsome than pretty.

4860
05:06:35,560 --> 05:06:36,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4861
05:06:37,260 --> 05:06:37,720
Right?

4862
05:06:39,660 --> 05:06:41,420
People also use, like, twink.

4863
05:06:41,560 --> 05:06:42,720
Oh, that's true too!

4864
05:06:43,320 --> 05:06:45,820
But I wouldn't call Raiden, like, Bishounen.

4865
05:06:48,040 --> 05:06:48,560
Actually...

4866
05:06:50,580 --> 05:06:52,180
Maybe he is a bit of a Bishounen.

4867
05:06:52,260 --> 05:06:52,920
But like, you know what?

4868
05:06:53,260 --> 05:06:55,680
For some reason, my brain just keeps thinking Sephiroth.

4869
05:06:56,180 --> 05:07:00,460
Like him and Sesshoumaru, people were like, oh, they're so Bishounen.

4870
05:07:06,840 --> 05:07:08,260
Raiden, absolutely Bishounen.

4871
05:07:09,360 --> 05:07:10,440
Depends on which Raiden.

4872
05:07:10,580 --> 05:07:11,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

4873
05:07:11,620 --> 05:07:15,120
When I think of Raiden, my mind immediately goes to Metal Gear Solid 2.

4874
05:07:15,860 --> 05:07:18,340
I don't think of really any other Raiden.

4875
05:07:20,080 --> 05:07:23,200
My mind immediately goes to Metal Gear Solid 2 Raiden.

4876
05:07:23,680 --> 05:07:24,920
Other Raidens...

4877
05:07:25,620 --> 05:07:27,440
They don't feel like Raiden to me.

4878
05:07:35,430 --> 05:07:36,550
Not Revengeance?

4879
05:07:36,630 --> 05:07:36,910
No.

4880
05:07:37,930 --> 05:07:38,730
No, not...

4881
05:07:38,730 --> 05:07:41,010
No, I never really think about Revengeance Raiden.

4882
05:07:46,410 --> 05:07:46,970
Anyway.

4883
05:07:47,990 --> 05:07:49,030
I loved those women.

4884
05:07:49,590 --> 05:07:50,230
Oh, yeah.

4885
05:07:50,690 --> 05:07:51,490
I really did.

4886
05:07:52,430 --> 05:07:54,550
That's why I had to kill them.

4887
05:07:56,110 --> 05:07:58,690
There was nothing else to be done.

4888
05:07:59,590 --> 05:08:01,610
Can you understand that?

4889
05:08:02,250 --> 05:08:02,690
No.

4890
05:08:03,310 --> 05:08:04,630
Like hell I can.

4891
05:08:07,750 --> 05:08:08,650
I thought not.

4892
05:08:09,330 --> 05:08:10,770
But Viper was different.

4893
05:08:12,830 --> 05:08:16,350
Viper took me in when I was cornered by the FBI.

4894
05:08:19,310 --> 05:08:24,110
I thought it was gonna be much more like when I was cornered by the world.

4895
05:08:24,530 --> 05:08:24,830
Outcast.

4896
05:08:25,230 --> 05:08:27,190
When I was, you know, cornered.

4897
05:08:27,190 --> 05:08:27,810
But no.

4898
05:08:28,150 --> 05:08:29,510
The goddamn FBI.

4899
05:08:35,890 --> 05:08:38,700
He forgave me my sins.

4900
05:08:40,900 --> 05:08:46,140
Black Chamber gave me a way to sate the mad hunger in my mind.

4901
05:08:47,980 --> 05:08:51,280
I became the perfect assassin.

4902
05:08:52,340 --> 05:08:53,280
Assassin.

4903
05:08:53,660 --> 05:08:53,960
Sorry.

4904
05:08:53,960 --> 05:08:54,100
Sorry.

4905
05:08:57,040 --> 05:09:00,640
But two years ago, you cowards betrayed us.

4906
05:09:01,640 --> 05:09:05,820
And laced my madness with lust for revenge.

4907
05:09:06,720 --> 05:09:08,040
For vengeance!

4908
05:09:10,740 --> 05:09:13,660
There will be no absolution for you.

4909
05:09:15,660 --> 05:09:16,620
For what?

4910
05:09:18,520 --> 05:09:19,800
American Psycho?

4911
05:09:19,860 --> 05:09:21,060
More like American Bishi.

4912
05:09:23,960 --> 05:09:24,440
Viper.

4913
05:09:24,960 --> 05:09:26,860
He lost his left arm.

4914
05:09:27,680 --> 05:09:28,620
In that hell.

4915
05:09:29,660 --> 05:09:32,700
But he won't use his prosthetics.

4916
05:09:33,160 --> 05:09:34,140
Not usually.

4917
05:09:35,120 --> 05:09:36,540
Do you know why?

4918
05:09:37,700 --> 05:09:40,000
Okay, now that like this game...

4919
05:09:40,000 --> 05:09:40,960
I know that this game...

4920
05:09:41,580 --> 05:09:42,100
Cause, okay.

4921
05:09:42,280 --> 05:09:45,160
When I was like, initially seeing everything and all the...

4922
05:09:45,160 --> 05:09:47,200
I was like, oh the codec sound is from...

4923
05:09:47,200 --> 05:09:48,140
Is... what... is...

4924
05:09:48,680 --> 05:09:49,180
Like, okay.

4925
05:09:49,400 --> 05:09:49,700
Hold on.

4926
05:09:49,780 --> 05:09:50,320
Let me back up.

4927
05:09:51,280 --> 05:09:53,140
Now that I realize...

4928
05:09:53,140 --> 05:09:55,140
Now that I know that this game...

4929
05:09:59,100 --> 05:10:01,380
Release date came after Metal Gear Solid.

4930
05:10:02,940 --> 05:10:06,140
I don't know how to feel about this, because before I was like...

4931
05:10:07,160 --> 05:10:12,180
Before I was just like, wow, Metal Gear Solid took so many things from this game.

4932
05:10:12,420 --> 05:10:13,700
Like, that's, you know, so cool.

4933
05:10:15,400 --> 05:10:17,140
And now I'm like...

4934
05:10:23,900 --> 05:10:24,640
I don't know.

4935
05:10:24,940 --> 05:10:26,120
I'm like...

4936
05:10:27,080 --> 05:10:28,940
Got a lot of leftover content, yeah.

4937
05:10:29,860 --> 05:10:30,760
Yeah, I guess so.

4938
05:10:31,340 --> 05:10:35,080
If anyone is the ass-ass in them, it's me.

4939
05:10:35,900 --> 05:10:36,940
Yeah, it's you.

4940
05:10:40,480 --> 05:10:44,900
I guess this feels like Metal Gear Solid Extra, you know.

4941
05:10:47,440 --> 05:10:50,540
But I was like, I was actually feeling so like...

4942
05:10:50,540 --> 05:10:53,640
Wow, Metal Gear Solid really took so much from this game.

4943
05:10:53,920 --> 05:10:54,940
That's cool.

4944
05:10:55,520 --> 05:10:57,780
But now I'm like, oh, it's definitely the opposite.

4945
05:11:01,200 --> 05:11:01,880
No.

4946
05:11:03,740 --> 05:11:07,540
Because every time he looks at the stump...

4947
05:11:09,240 --> 05:11:10,560
Don't call it that.

4948
05:11:11,160 --> 05:11:12,020
I can remember.

4949
05:11:13,080 --> 05:11:19,660
His last comrades and vow vengeance on Anonymous all over again.

4950
05:11:22,220 --> 05:11:22,860
Anonymous?

4951
05:11:23,380 --> 05:11:23,680
What?

4952
05:11:27,180 --> 05:11:28,400
The stump.

4953
05:11:28,700 --> 05:11:31,440
My cat has a nub tail, but I call it a nub.

4954
05:11:31,780 --> 05:11:33,920
I feel like nub sounds better than stump.

4955
05:11:35,820 --> 05:11:38,840
His madness surpasses even my own.

4956
05:11:40,180 --> 05:11:42,960
And that's why I can believe it.

4957
05:11:44,520 --> 05:11:46,180
My sight is fading.

4958
05:11:47,180 --> 05:11:50,580
No more dreams of that field.

4959
05:11:52,460 --> 05:11:55,120
Laura, over here.

4960
05:11:56,080 --> 05:11:56,660
I'm...

4961
05:11:57,240 --> 05:11:57,740
No.

4962
05:12:00,060 --> 05:12:02,580
Please, you can't.

4963
05:12:04,360 --> 05:12:05,520
Creepy.

4964
05:12:06,980 --> 05:12:10,580
Looks like the gates of heaven are close to you.

4965
05:12:11,460 --> 05:12:12,040
Damn.

4966
05:12:12,040 --> 05:12:16,120
It's like they were trying to out Metal Gear Solid MGS1, right?

4967
05:12:22,980 --> 05:12:26,420
This still took place way before V and I'm hearing a lot of that now.

4968
05:12:28,000 --> 05:12:28,600
Yeah.

4969
05:12:30,900 --> 05:12:32,200
Snake, hurry.

4970
05:12:32,620 --> 05:12:35,040
Metal Gear is in the launch phase.

4971
05:12:36,560 --> 05:12:37,840
I ran a satellite check.

4972
05:12:38,440 --> 05:12:40,760
Metal Gear is already above ground.

4973
05:12:40,880 --> 05:12:41,320
Oh shoot.

4974
05:12:42,960 --> 05:12:45,040
Metal Gear is to the north.

4975
05:12:45,040 --> 05:12:47,500
Just keep going north.

4976
05:12:48,540 --> 05:12:50,180
There's no time left.

4977
05:12:50,320 --> 05:12:50,580
Go!

4978
05:12:51,540 --> 05:12:52,240
Nice.

4979
05:12:52,540 --> 05:12:53,020
Okay, good.

4980
05:12:53,080 --> 05:12:54,290
This isn't time, so...

4981
05:12:58,790 --> 05:13:00,600
Oh, it's one of these again.

4982
05:13:01,380 --> 05:13:02,240
These are kind of fun though.

4983
05:13:04,560 --> 05:13:04,980
Punch!

4984
05:13:13,990 --> 05:13:14,730
Punch!

4985
05:13:15,650 --> 05:13:16,030
Okay.

4986
05:13:17,170 --> 05:13:18,390
What does this one do?

4987
05:13:18,810 --> 05:13:19,310
Punch!

4988
05:13:20,730 --> 05:13:23,590
Does this reset everything and then this resets everything?

4989
05:13:24,190 --> 05:13:25,330
Oh, or no it doesn't.

4990
05:13:25,390 --> 05:13:25,950
Okay, hold on.

4991
05:13:28,410 --> 05:13:29,510
Okay, hold on.

4992
05:13:32,910 --> 05:13:33,470
Punch!

4993
05:13:40,210 --> 05:13:42,430
Okay, maybe this one resets everything.

4994
05:13:43,150 --> 05:13:43,830
Okay, so punch.

4995
05:13:52,100 --> 05:13:52,660
Punch?

4996
05:13:53,380 --> 05:13:53,700
No?

4997
05:14:04,380 --> 05:14:06,260
Yeah, I guess third down resets it.

4998
05:14:09,080 --> 05:14:12,180
Wait, but this one...

4999
05:14:12,180 --> 05:14:13,700
Ah, maybe this one again?

5000
05:14:14,640 --> 05:14:15,080
No?

5001
05:14:16,100 --> 05:14:16,940
What is this?

5002
05:14:17,120 --> 05:14:20,480
This one like...

5003
05:14:23,290 --> 05:14:24,290
Oh, wait.

5004
05:14:24,470 --> 05:14:27,010
Okay, I need the...

5005
05:14:27,010 --> 05:14:27,630
Okay, hold on.

5006
05:14:51,420 --> 05:14:52,680
What does this one do again?

5007
05:14:52,820 --> 05:14:53,680
I can't remember.

5008
05:15:03,330 --> 05:15:05,170
And then this one...

5009
05:15:05,170 --> 05:15:06,570
Does this shift it?

5010
05:15:11,690 --> 05:15:12,110
Uh...

5011
05:15:12,770 --> 05:15:13,510
What is this?

5012
05:15:20,310 --> 05:15:22,290
The top moves everything up.

5013
05:15:22,350 --> 05:15:24,050
Yeah, but I need it to go down.

5014
05:15:24,210 --> 05:15:27,050
I need to get these two open so I can do this one.

5015
05:15:32,560 --> 05:15:34,340
It like just does the same thing.

5016
05:15:34,580 --> 05:15:35,100
Wait, hold on.

5017
05:15:35,860 --> 05:15:37,320
What if I do that and this?

5018
05:15:39,260 --> 05:15:40,780
Then maybe... What about this?

5019
05:15:47,450 --> 05:15:47,930
Um...

5020
05:15:50,420 --> 05:15:54,220
No, I can't hit anything while it's moving because I'm like stuck in place.

5021
05:15:56,260 --> 05:15:58,880
Move them up until you can use the bottom one.

5022
05:15:59,740 --> 05:16:01,760
But it doesn't move them up.

5023
05:16:01,900 --> 05:16:03,160
That's why I'm kind of confused.

5024
05:16:05,080 --> 05:16:09,440
That's why I'm kind of confused because it doesn't really move them up.

5025
05:16:09,480 --> 05:16:10,480
It just goes...

5026
05:16:12,240 --> 05:16:14,320
That's why I don't understand it.

5027
05:16:14,320 --> 05:16:16,920
And this one for sure resets everything.

5028
05:16:17,620 --> 05:16:18,420
That's so annoying.

5029
05:16:18,760 --> 05:16:20,320
I don't need a button that resets it.

5030
05:16:58,640 --> 05:16:59,740
No way!

5031
05:17:00,060 --> 05:17:01,340
He's going to help me!

5032
05:17:05,560 --> 05:17:06,420
Oh yay!

5033
05:17:10,840 --> 05:17:11,500
Lucky.

5034
05:17:13,600 --> 05:17:14,040
OK OK

5035
05:17:22,600 --> 05:17:24,040
No way.

5036
05:17:24,120 --> 05:17:24,760
They just open?

5037
05:17:29,130 --> 05:17:30,410
They just open?

5038
05:17:30,710 --> 05:17:31,470
Oh my god.

5039
05:17:31,570 --> 05:17:32,170
No way.

5040
05:17:43,340 --> 05:17:44,920
That's so silly!

5041
05:17:48,880 --> 05:17:50,240
That's too silly.

5042
05:17:53,020 --> 05:17:53,920
What's this?

5043
05:17:54,600 --> 05:17:56,020
Mine dete... Oh no.

5044
05:17:56,600 --> 05:17:57,160
OK.

5045
05:17:57,600 --> 05:17:58,960
I was going to say, there's no one around.

5046
05:17:59,940 --> 05:18:00,220
Easy.

5047
05:18:04,990 --> 05:18:06,190
Mine detector.

5048
05:18:06,450 --> 05:18:07,730
OK, maybe...

5049
05:18:10,070 --> 05:18:12,050
How does it detect the mines?

5050
05:18:13,550 --> 05:18:17,050
Do they show up on the...

5051
05:18:17,050 --> 05:18:18,270
Where do they show up?

5052
05:18:19,150 --> 05:18:20,570
The mines that we detect.

5053
05:18:26,760 --> 05:18:28,940
I guess we'll figure it out.

5054
05:18:28,940 --> 05:18:29,800
Oh, wait.

5055
05:18:32,440 --> 05:18:33,940
OK, those are...

5056
05:18:35,540 --> 05:18:36,540
Not people.

5057
05:18:36,820 --> 05:18:37,500
Those are mines.

5058
05:18:37,600 --> 05:18:37,920
OK, good.

5059
05:18:38,620 --> 05:18:42,320
Can I go over them?

5060
05:18:43,560 --> 05:18:44,200
Like...

5061
05:18:44,200 --> 05:18:44,340
I

5062
05:18:48,110 --> 05:18:49,590
don't feel like testing.

5063
05:18:51,050 --> 05:18:52,650
I can crawl over them?

5064
05:18:55,890 --> 05:18:57,010
Yes, you can.

5065
05:18:57,270 --> 05:18:57,570
OK.

5066
05:18:57,890 --> 05:18:58,890
I'm going to try.

5067
05:19:01,530 --> 05:19:02,370
Let's go.

5068
05:19:05,730 --> 05:19:06,850
OK, nice.

5069
05:19:07,150 --> 05:19:07,990
I'm collecting them.

5070
05:19:09,150 --> 05:19:10,590
And I'm going backwards.

5071
05:19:11,730 --> 05:19:12,930
I got sick moves.

5072
05:19:20,900 --> 05:19:23,060
Keep going north they say.

5073
05:19:23,220 --> 05:19:24,900
Keep going north they say.

5074
05:19:29,460 --> 05:19:29,800
OK.

5075
05:19:31,560 --> 05:19:32,620
It's quiet.

5076
05:19:33,060 --> 05:19:35,200
What is this?

5077
05:19:35,420 --> 05:19:35,800
Oh god.

5078
05:19:37,780 --> 05:19:40,400
Snake, you won't get past this point.

5079
05:19:41,940 --> 05:19:43,220
Who are you?

5080
05:19:47,520 --> 05:19:52,160
It's finally time to send you all into hell.

5081
05:19:53,560 --> 05:19:54,560
This music though.

5082
05:19:55,740 --> 05:19:56,800
You must be Viper.

5083
05:19:58,560 --> 05:20:01,180
Pleasure to see you, Solid Snake.

5084
05:20:01,340 --> 05:20:06,080
I'm going to give him a British accent for no reason in particular.

5085
05:20:07,080 --> 05:20:08,760
Retribution begins now.

5086
05:20:09,320 --> 05:20:11,740
Stand and watch the show, Snake.

5087
05:20:13,820 --> 05:20:14,700
Snake!

5088
05:20:15,280 --> 05:20:15,860
Metal Gear!

5089
05:20:16,640 --> 05:20:19,240
Oh my god.

5090
05:20:19,840 --> 05:20:20,720
It looks like an Eva.

5091
05:20:21,040 --> 05:20:21,540
Oh my god.

5092
05:20:27,700 --> 05:20:28,580
Christ.

5093
05:20:31,640 --> 05:20:34,360
This is just the beginning.

5094
05:20:35,220 --> 05:20:37,180
It's payback time.

5095
05:20:41,120 --> 05:20:43,100
We'll meet again, Solid Snake.

5096
05:20:43,240 --> 05:20:44,260
Oh, that's it?

5097
05:20:44,460 --> 05:20:45,120
There's no fight?

5098
05:20:45,340 --> 05:20:46,180
I don't have to fight the high...

5099
05:20:46,180 --> 05:20:47,720
OK, I guess I fight it later.

5100
05:20:48,000 --> 05:20:48,560
Oh gosh.

5101
05:20:51,600 --> 05:20:54,340
The next time you die.

5102
05:20:55,080 --> 05:20:55,720
Oh boy.

5103
05:20:57,860 --> 05:20:58,920
What the hell is that?

5104
05:20:59,060 --> 05:20:59,760
What are these?

5105
05:21:00,900 --> 05:21:01,640
What are those?

5106
05:21:05,560 --> 05:21:06,380
Oh my god.

5107
05:21:06,960 --> 05:21:08,620
What is... I can't move at all.

5108
05:21:12,580 --> 05:21:13,980
Watch out, Snake.

5109
05:21:14,240 --> 05:21:15,320
Firing ahead.

5110
05:21:17,360 --> 05:21:19,380
There's an artillery unit to the north.

5111
05:21:20,440 --> 05:21:23,880
Just this side of the maintenance base.

5112
05:21:25,180 --> 05:21:26,920
They're firing like crazy.

5113
05:21:28,240 --> 05:21:30,260
Sorry, I bit my tongue so I said crazy.

5114
05:21:32,240 --> 05:21:33,760
Get out of there now.

5115
05:21:34,760 --> 05:21:36,580
But Metal Gear...

5116
05:21:37,600 --> 05:21:39,360
Get out of there, Snake.

5117
05:21:40,000 --> 05:21:42,540
There's no way through that barrage.

5118
05:21:44,660 --> 05:21:45,180
But...

5119
05:21:45,180 --> 05:21:46,320
You keep biting your tongue.

5120
05:21:46,400 --> 05:21:49,560
I know, I don't know why I've been biting my tongue so often.

5121
05:21:50,460 --> 05:21:52,660
Snake, Metal Gear's already fired a nuke.

5122
05:21:53,180 --> 05:21:55,260
We can't afford to lose you as well.

5123
05:21:56,500 --> 05:21:57,200
Damn it.

5124
05:21:58,540 --> 05:22:00,560
Go back the way you came.

5125
05:22:01,340 --> 05:22:02,980
Now isn't the time to go in.

5126
05:22:03,700 --> 05:22:04,220
OK.

5127
05:22:04,220 --> 05:22:04,500
OK.

5128
05:22:07,160 --> 05:22:08,480
Look at your radar.

5129
05:22:09,380 --> 05:22:14,100
I've modified it to display the artillery impact as a point.

5130
05:22:15,100 --> 05:22:15,460
Oh my god.

5131
05:22:16,520 --> 05:22:16,800
OK.

5132
05:22:17,760 --> 05:22:22,100
Snake, avoid the artillery fire and go south.

5133
05:22:28,590 --> 05:22:32,470
Wait, so now I have to avoid the stuff and also...

5134
05:22:33,090 --> 05:22:33,610
Oh my gosh.

5135
05:22:45,980 --> 05:22:46,220
I rolled

5136
05:22:54,700 --> 05:22:55,940
over it and it picked it up.

5137
05:22:56,400 --> 05:22:56,820
What happened?

5138
05:23:02,190 --> 05:23:03,050
Oh my gosh.

5139
05:23:03,570 --> 05:23:04,570
This is...

5140
05:23:05,710 --> 05:23:07,030
I don't like this part.

5141
05:23:10,250 --> 05:23:11,810
The artillery hit me.

5142
05:23:12,870 --> 05:23:14,010
Oh my gosh.

5143
05:23:14,570 --> 05:23:15,590
This is insanity.

5144
05:23:20,810 --> 05:23:22,710
How did I get so far before?

5145
05:23:25,490 --> 05:23:26,850
What the hell?

5146
05:23:26,850 --> 05:23:29,430
Oh wait, I got hit by the bomb.

5147
05:23:34,430 --> 05:23:37,730
There should be a way without any...

5148
05:23:37,730 --> 05:23:38,810
What's it called?

5149
05:23:39,610 --> 05:23:40,930
Any landmines, I feel.

5150
05:24:02,950 --> 05:24:04,070
Oh my god.

5151
05:24:04,590 --> 05:24:09,890
Snake, the warhead launched by Metal Gear just impacted on mainland US.

5152
05:24:10,310 --> 05:24:11,070
Oh god.

5153
05:24:11,710 --> 05:24:12,370
Casualties?

5154
05:24:13,510 --> 05:24:14,070
None.

5155
05:24:15,170 --> 05:24:16,010
What?

5156
05:24:16,010 --> 05:24:18,790
It was a fake.

5157
05:24:19,850 --> 05:24:23,970
The coordinates were set to an unpopulated area.

5158
05:24:24,630 --> 05:24:27,570
A nuclear testing site in Nevada.

5159
05:24:27,890 --> 05:24:28,650
Oh my god.

5160
05:24:29,850 --> 05:24:31,070
What kind of a sick...

5161
05:24:31,830 --> 05:24:32,750
Oh, make a bride!

5162
05:24:33,050 --> 05:24:37,010
All the same, there's a huge crater at that site.

5163
05:24:37,750 --> 05:24:41,770
We need to get a cover story to the press.

5164
05:24:43,970 --> 05:24:48,010
Metal Gear's existence cannot be made public.

5165
05:24:50,130 --> 05:24:53,190
That appears to be the CIA's forte.

5166
05:24:54,190 --> 05:24:55,190
So not a fake.

5167
05:24:55,350 --> 05:24:59,410
By fake, it felt like he meant it was a dud.

5168
05:24:59,830 --> 05:25:02,350
Like it was a blank.

5169
05:25:03,770 --> 05:25:06,650
Be the CIA's forte, after all.

5170
05:25:07,770 --> 05:25:10,890
Certainly, but it won't be easy.

5171
05:25:12,530 --> 05:25:17,570
Constructing a plausible denial for the masses requires preparations.

5172
05:25:17,830 --> 05:25:20,430
I hope nobody was there visiting that site.

5173
05:25:20,590 --> 05:25:26,510
Imagine they're like, today we're doing a site... a tour of the nuclear testing site.

5174
05:25:26,870 --> 05:25:28,610
Luckily, today is our day off.

5175
05:25:28,990 --> 05:25:31,470
So there won't be any nukes today.

5176
05:25:31,790 --> 05:25:33,150
And then...

5177
05:25:35,130 --> 05:25:44,890
Snake, GILF transmitted a message to the American President just after the impact.

5178
05:25:45,730 --> 05:25:49,810
I'm sending it to you as well.

5179
05:25:56,050 --> 05:25:58,350
Who is that?

5180
05:25:58,610 --> 05:26:00,250
Who is that behind him?

5181
05:26:01,250 --> 05:26:03,310
Hello, Mr. President.

5182
05:26:04,990 --> 05:26:06,410
Did you like my present?

5183
05:26:07,770 --> 05:26:09,470
I'm sure you did.

5184
05:26:09,770 --> 05:26:13,190
It is, after all, made in the USA.

5185
05:26:14,850 --> 05:26:18,230
No doubt you know the gist of my message.

5186
05:26:19,530 --> 05:26:27,490
Withdraw the UN troops from Gindra immediately and recognize our sov... sov... sovereignty.

5187
05:26:29,470 --> 05:26:30,230
Sovereignty.

5188
05:26:30,950 --> 05:26:36,890
With US backing, the motion will face no delays at the UN Security Council.

5189
05:26:38,870 --> 05:26:41,970
You can save face and millions of lives.

5190
05:26:42,550 --> 05:26:43,450
Voting lives.

5191
05:26:43,690 --> 05:26:46,150
You need the people to vote.

5192
05:26:47,050 --> 05:26:49,070
Not a bad deal, I think.

5193
05:26:50,130 --> 05:26:56,450
But I'll set a deadline just to save you the procrastinating as well.

5194
05:26:56,450 --> 05:26:58,450
3 hours.

5195
05:26:58,610 --> 05:27:00,890
OK guys, I have to beat the game in 3 hours.

5196
05:27:01,750 --> 05:27:09,430
If our demands are not met within 3 hours, a real nuclear warhead will be launched.

5197
05:27:10,570 --> 05:27:14,490
The target will be... New York City!

5198
05:27:15,870 --> 05:27:17,270
Or Los Angeles.

5199
05:27:17,430 --> 05:27:18,510
OK, make up your mind.

5200
05:27:19,110 --> 05:27:21,710
Or perhaps, Washington D.C.

5201
05:27:21,710 --> 05:27:27,170
You should start saying GILF is transmitting a message instead of MATARO is going on Discord.

5202
05:27:32,790 --> 05:27:35,030
OK, I'll try to remember that for next time.

5203
05:27:36,590 --> 05:27:39,150
We'll see how I feel at the time.

5204
05:27:40,190 --> 05:27:42,630
I expect glad tidings soon.

5205
05:27:48,960 --> 05:27:51,820
OK guys, I hope you don't live in Washington D.C.

5206
05:27:51,880 --> 05:27:54,220
or New York City or Los Angeles.

5207
05:27:54,220 --> 05:27:55,960
Of course the U.S.

5208
05:27:56,080 --> 05:27:58,460
government will make no concessions.

5209
05:27:59,820 --> 05:28:01,100
Certainly not!

5210
05:28:01,420 --> 05:28:02,900
OK McBride, hold on.

5211
05:28:03,520 --> 05:28:05,520
We don't negotiate with terrorists.

5212
05:28:07,700 --> 05:28:10,160
But we can't get to Metal Gear.

5213
05:28:11,660 --> 05:28:17,520
He may not look it, but Jimmy did head the unit's development.

5214
05:28:17,800 --> 05:28:20,300
Sorry, the timing on this is so hard to read.

5215
05:28:20,300 --> 05:28:24,100
He may know how to stop the strike.

5216
05:28:25,120 --> 05:28:27,300
Get him on the codec.

5217
05:28:29,140 --> 05:28:29,860
Chris.

5218
05:28:30,240 --> 05:28:31,260
Hold on one second.

5219
05:28:32,240 --> 05:28:34,360
How much more do you think I have the game realistically?

5220
05:28:42,370 --> 05:28:45,690
I have about 6 chapters left it seems.

5221
05:28:48,730 --> 05:28:50,830
Maybe 2 or 4 mini-bosses, yeah.

5222
05:28:51,110 --> 05:28:52,630
3 hours, didn't you hear the message?

5223
05:28:55,370 --> 05:28:57,170
Please save New York City again.

5224
05:28:58,090 --> 05:28:58,650
What?

5225
05:29:00,090 --> 05:29:00,350
Snake?

5226
05:29:02,430 --> 05:29:03,130
Is Jimmy there?

5227
05:29:04,710 --> 05:29:05,690
He is, but...

5228
05:29:06,950 --> 05:29:07,790
Put him on.

5229
05:29:10,110 --> 05:29:10,870
Oh, OK.

5230
05:29:12,870 --> 05:29:13,430
What?

5231
05:29:14,550 --> 05:29:19,510
Jimmy, how do we prevent Metal Gear from launching?

5232
05:29:22,410 --> 05:29:28,330
Well, like I said before, the rail gun uses a lot of power.

5233
05:29:28,830 --> 05:29:29,130
So?

5234
05:29:30,650 --> 05:29:31,790
But no power.

5235
05:29:32,370 --> 05:29:33,610
The gun is useless.

5236
05:29:34,790 --> 05:29:35,130
Yeah.

5237
05:29:36,830 --> 05:29:39,810
Snake, you could destroy that power plant.

5238
05:29:40,810 --> 05:29:44,810
Yeah, but what about Metal Gear's...

5239
05:29:46,970 --> 05:29:48,290
What's happening?

5240
05:29:49,510 --> 05:29:50,790
What is it?

5241
05:29:51,410 --> 05:29:52,230
What's going on?

5242
05:29:53,810 --> 05:29:54,330
Hijack?

5243
05:29:57,270 --> 05:29:59,970
Jimmy, Chris, respond!

5244
05:30:00,650 --> 05:30:02,550
What's happening over there?

5245
05:30:03,970 --> 05:30:06,250
The wizard, he's gone!

5246
05:30:06,970 --> 05:30:10,430
I keep wanting to sing The Wizard and I, because it's wicked.

5247
05:30:10,750 --> 05:30:12,370
I want to go see the Wicked movie.

5248
05:30:13,350 --> 05:30:16,530
I don't know, but I heard gunshots.

5249
05:30:18,590 --> 05:30:19,250
Were they attacked?

5250
05:30:24,400 --> 05:30:28,240
No, the power plant has to be destroyed first.

5251
05:30:28,340 --> 05:30:32,300
OK McBride, this guy has no care for any lives at all.

5252
05:30:34,880 --> 05:30:35,920
Mr. McBride!

5253
05:30:37,520 --> 05:30:39,580
They're about to strike.

5254
05:30:40,360 --> 05:30:44,160
Millions of civilian American lives are at risk.

5255
05:30:44,260 --> 05:30:45,880
OK, maybe he does care about...

5256
05:30:45,880 --> 05:30:47,660
This is the trolley problem, right?

5257
05:30:48,940 --> 05:30:51,940
Do you kill millions of people or do you save the wizard?

5258
05:30:53,700 --> 05:30:56,480
Snake, your mission is to destroy Metal Gear.

5259
05:30:57,460 --> 05:31:00,960
Don't let your emotions lead you astray.

5260
05:31:02,600 --> 05:31:04,800
Every operation has its casualties.

5261
05:31:07,140 --> 05:31:07,780
Snake...

5262
05:31:09,400 --> 05:31:11,000
What's it going to be?

5263
05:31:12,420 --> 05:31:15,040
I'm going for the plant.

5264
05:31:16,360 --> 05:31:17,000
Snake!

5265
05:31:18,320 --> 05:31:19,400
I think they'll be fine.

5266
05:31:19,940 --> 05:31:22,120
But I'm not abandoning Chris and Jimmy.

5267
05:31:23,120 --> 05:31:24,560
First, the plant.

5268
05:31:24,860 --> 05:31:26,500
Then, I'll find them.

5269
05:31:27,300 --> 05:31:29,140
Can you sing Defying Gravity after?

5270
05:31:30,760 --> 05:31:32,480
Yeah, hold on, let me drink some water.

5271
05:31:35,640 --> 05:31:38,380
Not for Defying Gravity, but hopefully it'll help me wake up.

5272
05:31:39,060 --> 05:31:41,300
I don't allow casualties.

5273
05:31:42,260 --> 05:31:44,280
Except when it's by my own hands.

5274
05:31:46,040 --> 05:31:46,560
Snake...

5275
05:31:47,800 --> 05:31:49,520
God, you're soft.

5276
05:31:49,780 --> 05:31:50,660
Oh, sorry, this is Weasel.

5277
05:31:50,920 --> 05:31:52,400
God, you're soft.

5278
05:31:53,120 --> 05:31:54,580
No, my name is Solid Snake.

5279
05:31:55,520 --> 05:31:58,620
It's a wonder you managed to live so long.

5280
05:31:58,620 --> 05:31:59,700
Oh my god.

5281
05:32:00,900 --> 05:32:01,760
Don't forget.

5282
05:32:03,080 --> 05:32:07,780
Preventing the nuclear strike is your first priority.

5283
05:32:09,180 --> 05:32:10,480
Soft Snake.

5284
05:32:11,440 --> 05:32:12,180
Go, Snake.

5285
05:32:12,780 --> 05:32:17,020
Take out the power plant and stop the launch.

5286
05:32:17,880 --> 05:32:18,420
Okay.

5287
05:32:20,240 --> 05:32:21,740
One second.

5288
05:32:22,600 --> 05:32:23,160
Let's see.

5289
05:32:25,040 --> 05:32:25,440
Okay.

5290
05:32:39,040 --> 05:32:41,060
I'm just gonna...

5291
05:32:41,480 --> 05:32:42,800
I was gonna look at the guide.

5292
05:32:43,600 --> 05:32:45,380
But I'm feeling like maybe I'll just...

5293
05:32:45,380 --> 05:32:46,560
Okay, we have one way.

5294
05:32:46,940 --> 05:32:49,160
I'll just explore some and figure it out.

5295
05:32:49,420 --> 05:32:53,560
If I get stuck, then I'll use it.

5296
05:32:53,760 --> 05:32:55,220
Oh, wait, I thought the power...

5297
05:32:56,200 --> 05:32:57,060
Is this the power plant?

5298
05:32:57,220 --> 05:32:57,820
Oh, here we go.

5299
05:32:59,240 --> 05:33:00,600
Is your head feeling better?

5300
05:33:01,920 --> 05:33:03,540
It's not bad.

5301
05:33:03,760 --> 05:33:04,860
It's just like there's a pressure.

5302
05:33:06,080 --> 05:33:07,140
But it doesn't hurt.

5303
05:33:07,300 --> 05:33:07,920
It's just annoying.

5304
05:33:09,940 --> 05:33:11,180
Megoromorox, welcome to the membership.

5305
05:33:11,340 --> 05:33:11,960
Thank you.

5306
05:33:12,820 --> 05:33:16,420
Snake, destroy the power plant's main turbine.

5307
05:33:17,400 --> 05:33:20,660
It's located in the B1 floor of the plant.

5308
05:33:22,360 --> 05:33:23,400
Oh, nice.

5309
05:33:23,660 --> 05:33:25,220
They gave us money... or health.

5310
05:33:25,400 --> 05:33:25,860
Not money.

5311
05:33:27,080 --> 05:33:28,500
I wish they gave us money.

5312
05:33:29,240 --> 05:33:31,180
Do our car keys work here?

5313
05:33:31,700 --> 05:33:31,980
No.

5314
05:33:32,500 --> 05:33:33,700
Sad, sad, sad.

5315
05:33:39,260 --> 05:33:41,300
B1, B1, B1.

5316
05:33:49,030 --> 05:33:51,790
Okay, there's a few places we can...

5317
05:33:54,770 --> 05:33:57,430
The floor is on... It's electric.

5318
05:33:58,690 --> 05:34:01,110
Snake, can you hear me?

5319
05:34:01,290 --> 05:34:02,530
Chris is alive.

5320
05:34:03,670 --> 05:34:05,890
Chris, what happened back there?

5321
05:34:05,890 --> 05:34:06,990
Or what happened back there?

5322
05:34:08,030 --> 05:34:09,650
They took us by surprise.

5323
05:34:10,750 --> 05:34:12,250
What about the wizard?

5324
05:34:12,510 --> 05:34:13,090
Is he okay?

5325
05:34:16,810 --> 05:34:17,490
Chris?

5326
05:34:19,330 --> 05:34:21,690
Jimmy was captured.

5327
05:34:22,130 --> 05:34:24,250
Come on!

5328
05:34:24,650 --> 05:34:24,930
What?

5329
05:34:26,050 --> 05:34:28,050
I saw a chance and ran.

5330
05:34:28,290 --> 05:34:30,330
Oh, she abandoned Jimmy.

5331
05:34:37,700 --> 05:34:38,640
She...

5332
05:34:38,640 --> 05:34:41,980
You had one... Chris, you had literally one job.

5333
05:34:48,930 --> 05:34:49,400
Chris...

5334
05:34:49,870 --> 05:34:51,710
Just myself again?

5335
05:34:53,630 --> 05:34:56,810
Chris, don't blame yourself.

5336
05:34:57,690 --> 05:34:58,630
But...

5337
05:34:59,300 --> 05:35:00,430
I can't.

5338
05:35:01,190 --> 05:35:03,570
Better that you're safe than neither of you.

5339
05:35:05,370 --> 05:35:07,190
I'm so useless.

5340
05:35:08,930 --> 05:35:10,470
Jimmy can't run.

5341
05:35:10,610 --> 05:35:11,750
We don't know that.

5342
05:35:13,210 --> 05:35:14,950
I was supposed to have protected him.

5343
05:35:16,650 --> 05:35:19,370
Chris, maybe he's just big boned, okay?

5344
05:35:19,990 --> 05:35:21,230
I can't blame her.

5345
05:35:23,510 --> 05:35:25,830
I wish I were the one taken.

5346
05:35:26,170 --> 05:35:28,430
No, what would Jimmy do then by himself?

5347
05:35:29,430 --> 05:35:31,610
What's that guy gonna do?

5348
05:35:32,410 --> 05:35:34,110
I can't do anything right.

5349
05:35:34,250 --> 05:35:36,330
Oh my god, I don't wanna hear your sob story, Chris.

5350
05:35:37,230 --> 05:35:38,690
Chris, you were in the power plant.

5351
05:35:39,670 --> 05:35:40,110
Weren't you?

5352
05:35:41,610 --> 05:35:41,850
What?

5353
05:35:42,090 --> 05:35:43,030
Oh, yes.

5354
05:35:44,010 --> 05:35:46,030
Tell me how I get in.

5355
05:35:47,470 --> 05:35:52,970
Sections of the floor area are electrified and can't be crossed.

5356
05:35:53,630 --> 05:35:58,970
But there is a control panel for the floor's electrical grid.

5357
05:35:58,970 --> 05:36:05,970
If you take that out, you should have no problems getting through.

5358
05:36:07,290 --> 05:36:13,310
As long as you use some weapon with a long range, like the Nikita missiles.

5359
05:36:13,850 --> 05:36:16,490
Got it.

5360
05:36:16,650 --> 05:36:20,710
Use Nikita missiles to go after the power array.

5361
05:36:22,390 --> 05:36:24,190
You've been in the plant once.

5362
05:36:24,190 --> 05:36:29,770
I'd like you to give me a backup with what you know.

5363
05:36:30,130 --> 05:36:31,430
Sorry, it's so slow.

5364
05:36:33,770 --> 05:36:36,310
But I could use your help.

5365
05:36:39,520 --> 05:36:43,720
They need to keep Metal Gear in operational state.

5366
05:36:44,480 --> 05:36:47,700
So they can't afford to kill Jimmy yet.

5367
05:36:49,360 --> 05:36:52,060
I think this mint was made for game.

5368
05:36:53,340 --> 05:36:54,060
Yes.

5369
05:36:55,060 --> 05:36:56,100
Thanks, Jordan.

5370
05:36:57,460 --> 05:36:58,900
I'll get him out before they can.

5371
05:37:00,100 --> 05:37:00,600
Snake.

5372
05:37:01,640 --> 05:37:04,180
I'm asking you to trust me.

5373
05:37:05,140 --> 05:37:05,380
OK.

5374
05:37:06,080 --> 05:37:10,820
Anything you need to know about the plant, just ask.

5375
05:37:11,120 --> 05:37:11,240
OK.

5376
05:37:11,660 --> 05:37:12,100
Snake.

5377
05:37:12,920 --> 05:37:13,560
Thank you.

5378
05:37:14,840 --> 05:37:17,880
Jimmy abandoned, but the Nintendo championships.

5379
05:37:20,820 --> 05:37:21,300
Ripperoni.

5380
05:37:21,740 --> 05:37:22,180
OK.

5381
05:37:23,020 --> 05:37:25,240
I'm guessing the Nikita missile is in here.

5382
05:37:26,920 --> 05:37:28,120
Oh, this is an elevator.

5383
05:37:28,260 --> 05:37:28,600
Just kidding.

5384
05:37:29,860 --> 05:37:31,880
And we can't go through there either, so...

5385
05:37:33,380 --> 05:37:34,180
Up we go.

5386
05:37:39,440 --> 05:37:42,400
Up, down, down, down we go.

5387
05:37:42,600 --> 05:37:42,940
Hold on.

5388
05:37:43,080 --> 05:37:43,860
I'm sorry.

5389
05:37:44,040 --> 05:37:44,880
I'm going to look in the...

5390
05:37:54,730 --> 05:37:55,410
To the basement.

5391
05:38:01,780 --> 05:38:05,320
Do you think mint would sound like a teleprompter?

5392
05:38:05,440 --> 05:38:06,580
I don't know.

5393
05:38:08,940 --> 05:38:09,900
It's so slow.

5394
05:38:10,000 --> 05:38:10,860
Probably, actually.

5395
05:38:12,780 --> 05:38:13,180
C1.

5396
05:38:14,900 --> 05:38:15,660
Teleprompters are faster.

5397
05:38:15,760 --> 05:38:18,260
I think someone is controlling a teleprompter.

5398
05:38:19,020 --> 05:38:20,600
So that you technically...

5399
05:38:22,740 --> 05:38:23,140
Wait.

5400
05:38:23,780 --> 05:38:24,600
It told me to come here.

5401
05:38:24,620 --> 05:38:24,920
Oh, wait.

5402
05:38:24,960 --> 05:38:25,240
Here we go.

5403
05:38:25,240 --> 05:38:29,940
So, you technically have someone controlling the speed.

5404
05:38:30,080 --> 05:38:33,240
So that you know how fast or slow...

5405
05:38:34,480 --> 05:38:35,820
You need to go.

5406
05:38:36,600 --> 05:38:36,840
Oh.

5407
05:38:37,780 --> 05:38:39,440
I'm here to relieve you.

5408
05:38:44,900 --> 05:38:45,580
Hallelujah.

5409
05:38:47,140 --> 05:38:49,360
Thought I'd never get to dry off.

5410
05:38:51,300 --> 05:38:53,260
This is a hell of a mess.

5411
05:38:53,260 --> 05:38:55,200
What happened?

5412
05:38:57,120 --> 05:39:04,580
It looks like the drainage duct got choked off somewhere during that squall.

5413
05:39:06,520 --> 05:39:09,380
We've got drainage water backing up into...

5414
05:39:10,200 --> 05:39:11,020
The plant.

5415
05:39:13,420 --> 05:39:15,600
That's why he's relieving himself?

5416
05:39:17,020 --> 05:39:18,740
Hey, that doesn't sound too good.

5417
05:39:20,780 --> 05:39:26,020
They say there's no problem with generating power itself.

5418
05:39:27,520 --> 05:39:31,580
Not exactly impressive in a high-tech installation.

5419
05:39:32,000 --> 05:39:37,080
Control led by a state-of-the-art computer system.

5420
05:39:38,160 --> 05:39:41,940
Well, as long as the cells get charged...

5421
05:39:43,340 --> 05:39:45,080
Everything's doing fine.

5422
05:39:45,860 --> 05:39:47,100
It's all yours.

5423
05:39:47,100 --> 05:39:48,120
Okay, bye.

5424
05:39:48,740 --> 05:39:49,300
What?

5425
05:39:51,520 --> 05:39:55,400
Oh, electricity's leaked into some of the puddles.

5426
05:39:56,580 --> 05:39:58,740
It looks like regular water.

5427
05:39:59,400 --> 05:40:02,060
But make sure you stay away from it.

5428
05:40:02,340 --> 05:40:03,140
Oh shoot.

5429
05:40:03,720 --> 05:40:05,020
Frosty, welcome to the membership.

5430
05:40:05,220 --> 05:40:05,780
Thank you.

5431
05:40:06,700 --> 05:40:08,000
Wouldn't want you getting hurt.

5432
05:40:08,460 --> 05:40:09,140
Or dying.

5433
05:40:09,600 --> 05:40:10,960
You know, if you step in a puddle.

5434
05:40:11,520 --> 05:40:12,480
Alright, good to know.

5435
05:40:13,080 --> 05:40:13,960
Oh my god.

5436
05:40:18,560 --> 05:40:19,980
Okay, can't go over there.

5437
05:40:29,870 --> 05:40:31,610
Wait, how am I supposed to...

5438
05:40:35,840 --> 05:40:37,020
How do I get through?

5439
05:40:39,880 --> 05:40:40,340
Crawl?

5440
05:41:00,980 --> 05:41:01,820
We'll be blue.

5441
05:41:02,560 --> 05:41:02,900
I

5442
05:41:11,270 --> 05:41:12,210
don't know where he goes.

5443
05:41:15,970 --> 05:41:18,070
Just the puddles touching the electric panels?

5444
05:41:18,290 --> 05:41:19,510
I'm not sure.

5445
05:41:19,890 --> 05:41:21,090
Oh no, there's another guy!

5446
05:41:23,950 --> 05:41:25,870
This part's tricky, huh?

5447
05:41:30,950 --> 05:41:32,710
What if I just run for it?

5448
05:41:34,990 --> 05:41:36,630
Screw being sneaky.

5449
05:41:37,290 --> 05:41:38,730
I'm done with this lifestyle.

5450
05:41:43,250 --> 05:41:45,430
Oh my god, oh my god!

5451
05:41:45,790 --> 05:41:47,350
I sure hope they didn't hear that!

5452
05:41:50,150 --> 05:41:50,650
What?

5453
05:42:00,180 --> 05:42:00,680
Sorry.

5454
05:42:08,660 --> 05:42:10,060
I think I got away with it.

5455
05:42:18,550 --> 05:42:20,210
What are all those guys doing down there?

5456
05:42:20,430 --> 05:42:21,690
Oh, are they looking for me?

5457
05:42:25,070 --> 05:42:26,070
Oh shoot.

5458
05:42:29,250 --> 05:42:30,310
I hate this.

5459
05:42:30,770 --> 05:42:32,490
I hate this so much.

5460
05:42:34,510 --> 05:42:35,190
Get up, snake.

5461
05:42:35,910 --> 05:42:36,790
Screw being sneaky!

5462
05:42:40,730 --> 05:42:42,030
Oh my god.

5463
05:42:42,270 --> 05:42:44,250
Wait, is this a place I can crawl?

5464
05:42:48,530 --> 05:42:50,310
I'm in the ducts.

5465
05:42:50,310 --> 05:42:51,030
I'm in the vents.

5466
05:42:54,490 --> 05:42:55,110
I'm venting?

5467
05:43:01,040 --> 05:43:02,160
I'm venting?

5468
05:43:02,540 --> 05:43:05,520
Maybe there's a kid of... in here.

5469
05:43:19,440 --> 05:43:20,480
I'm somewhere.

5470
05:43:22,380 --> 05:43:25,800
Oh my god, I forgot about the water.

5471
05:43:25,960 --> 05:43:26,620
Holy moly.

5472
05:43:28,000 --> 05:43:29,140
You think this water's fine?

5473
05:43:29,680 --> 05:43:33,720
I say, you think it's normal water, but it's not actually normal water.

5474
05:43:34,820 --> 05:43:35,820
It's scary.

5475
05:43:41,620 --> 05:43:44,360
I hear him sloshing around.

5476
05:43:47,640 --> 05:43:49,800
If I walk, he'll hear me for sure though.

5477
05:43:51,080 --> 05:43:51,780
Oh

5478
05:44:11,300 --> 05:44:13,620
my god, I gotta get the Nikita first.

5479
05:44:17,520 --> 05:44:18,740
Why are you awake?

5480
05:44:22,970 --> 05:44:23,970
We're fine.

5481
05:44:24,210 --> 05:44:24,830
Everything's OK.

5482
05:44:28,570 --> 05:44:29,770
Everything's A-OK.

5483
05:44:30,130 --> 05:44:31,050
I think that's it.

5484
05:44:31,650 --> 05:44:32,610
Is this electric?

5485
05:44:34,690 --> 05:44:41,970
How the hell am I supposed to get the damn missiles if everything is electrified?

5486
05:44:42,730 --> 05:44:43,690
What about this one?

5487
05:44:43,690 --> 05:44:44,870
Oh gosh.

5488
05:44:47,610 --> 05:44:49,430
Now I'm dancing with a guy!

5489
05:44:56,970 --> 05:44:59,510
This is so...

5490
05:45:07,050 --> 05:45:08,850
ID card 4!

5491
05:45:10,230 --> 05:45:11,270
Nice.

5492
05:45:12,810 --> 05:45:14,050
Excuse me.

5493
05:45:27,810 --> 05:45:29,570
It's right there.

5494
05:45:30,210 --> 05:45:31,290
Snake, do you copy?

5495
05:45:33,830 --> 05:45:35,530
Ever heard of this?

5496
05:45:37,610 --> 05:45:39,190
Wait, didn't we hear this one before?

5497
05:45:40,230 --> 05:45:43,950
Don't you think it's about time you talked about...

5498
05:45:43,950 --> 05:45:45,330
Yeah, we've heard this one before.

5499
05:45:45,450 --> 05:45:46,030
OK, nevermind.

5500
05:45:48,050 --> 05:45:48,650
Lame!

5501
05:45:49,950 --> 05:45:52,010
They only gave me three lines!

5502
05:45:57,250 --> 05:45:57,850
OK.

5503
05:45:58,310 --> 05:45:58,710
Oh my gosh.

5504
05:46:04,690 --> 05:46:06,290
There's no way to go around.

5505
05:46:11,190 --> 05:46:13,610
How the hell am I supposed to...

5506
05:46:13,610 --> 05:46:15,190
Oh my god, even this one.

5507
05:46:16,330 --> 05:46:17,510
Stupid, stupid.

5508
05:46:19,810 --> 05:46:20,530
Oh god.

5509
05:46:24,930 --> 05:46:25,890
It's surrounded.

5510
05:46:26,130 --> 05:46:26,770
I don't understand.

5511
05:46:36,100 --> 05:46:37,460
That was a unique one.

5512
05:46:37,600 --> 05:46:39,580
She just used the name of the same guy.

5513
05:46:40,080 --> 05:46:41,120
No, it wasn't.

5514
05:46:41,160 --> 05:46:42,200
We got that one before.

5515
05:46:43,520 --> 05:46:45,560
Where she said, do you think this is a compliment?

5516
05:46:45,820 --> 05:46:46,840
And I'm just like, yeah.

5517
05:46:47,320 --> 05:46:48,920
And she's like, no, it's not.

5518
05:46:52,920 --> 05:46:54,400
You can't crawl through it?

5519
05:46:55,080 --> 05:46:56,060
Oh, it's electric.

5520
05:46:56,360 --> 05:46:57,100
Why would I be able to...

5521
05:46:57,100 --> 05:47:00,300
There, for everybody who says, crawl through the electrified water.

5522
05:47:00,700 --> 05:47:06,340
I don't think crawling through electrified water really makes a difference because it's...

5523
05:47:07,160 --> 05:47:08,880
You can damage the green box.

5524
05:47:08,900 --> 05:47:09,220
You can?

5525
05:47:13,660 --> 05:47:15,080
I didn't get one guy.

5526
05:47:15,180 --> 05:47:16,440
Multiple people said it.

5527
05:47:16,980 --> 05:47:20,300
I was just proving them wrong.

5528
05:47:21,080 --> 05:47:22,220
How do I damage it though?

5529
05:47:30,950 --> 05:47:31,590
C4.

5530
05:47:32,490 --> 05:47:34,050
It'll make everybody angry.

5531
05:47:34,590 --> 05:47:35,230
Wait,

5532
05:47:40,320 --> 05:47:42,240
what was it again?

5533
05:47:44,060 --> 05:47:44,640
B to set.

5534
05:48:02,220 --> 05:48:04,420
Yeah, that's electrified water.

5535
05:48:07,060 --> 05:48:07,540
Evasion?

5536
05:48:07,860 --> 05:48:08,940
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

5537
05:48:16,620 --> 05:48:18,540
I cannot stand this game.

5538
05:48:18,680 --> 05:48:20,000
Why did this guy go up here?

5539
05:48:20,800 --> 05:48:22,180
Why did he go up here?

5540
05:48:22,820 --> 05:48:23,300
Why?

5541
05:48:24,380 --> 05:48:25,820
Why did he go up here?

5542
05:48:30,150 --> 05:48:31,970
It didn't... Guys, it didn't work.

5543
05:48:32,330 --> 05:48:33,450
Guys, it didn't work.

5544
05:48:33,650 --> 05:48:34,530
Everything is bad.

5545
05:48:34,670 --> 05:48:35,530
Everything is bad.

5546
05:48:35,610 --> 05:48:36,330
It didn't work.

5547
05:48:36,330 --> 05:48:37,610
Everything is bad.

5548
05:48:37,930 --> 05:48:38,830
Everything sucks.

5549
05:49:00,820 --> 05:49:02,660
Guide says go back to the elevator.

5550
05:49:03,500 --> 05:49:04,700
After you get the key.

5551
05:49:05,260 --> 05:49:06,040
I'll do that.

5552
05:49:07,060 --> 05:49:08,320
I'll go back to the elevator.

5553
05:49:18,490 --> 05:49:18,930
Ouch,

5554
05:49:32,040 --> 05:49:32,440
ouch, ouch.

5555
05:49:32,560 --> 05:49:32,960
Wrong way.

5556
05:49:33,460 --> 05:49:33,900
Karma.

5557
05:49:43,320 --> 05:49:44,580
Oh, I crawled through here.

5558
05:49:44,640 --> 05:49:44,920
That's right.

5559
05:49:52,890 --> 05:49:54,790
I can't stand this game!

5560
05:49:58,570 --> 05:50:00,610
I can't stand this game!

5561
05:50:16,950 --> 05:50:17,630
Just kidding.

5562
05:50:19,490 --> 05:50:20,470
Yeah, there we go.

5563
05:50:22,630 --> 05:50:23,690
Little lizard.

5564
05:50:24,950 --> 05:50:28,810
I feel like when I look at him from the front his eyes are bugging.

5565
05:50:29,290 --> 05:50:32,730
It looks like I can see his little tongue go...

5566
05:50:32,730 --> 05:50:34,390
At any second now, you know?

5567
05:50:36,510 --> 05:50:38,510
You know how lizards do that?

5568
05:50:42,630 --> 05:50:44,170
That's what I feel like I'm gonna see.

5569
05:50:45,910 --> 05:50:47,690
Oh, there's a ration right there.

5570
05:50:47,810 --> 05:50:48,410
Good, good, good.

5571
05:51:05,760 --> 05:51:07,540
I can't even be mad.

5572
05:51:12,440 --> 05:51:14,180
I can't even be mad.

5573
05:51:18,460 --> 05:51:19,360
Oh my...

5574
05:51:19,360 --> 05:51:20,840
Okay, at least it starts us from...

5575
05:51:23,080 --> 05:51:24,040
From the...

5576
05:51:24,040 --> 05:51:25,120
Oh my gosh.

5577
05:51:25,220 --> 05:51:27,720
From when we got the card key.

5578
05:51:28,040 --> 05:51:29,840
I can't...

5579
05:51:32,560 --> 05:51:33,500
Love you, Mito.

5580
05:51:33,660 --> 05:51:33,780
Good luck.

5581
05:51:34,640 --> 05:51:35,480
Thank you.

5582
05:51:38,240 --> 05:51:39,740
Where does this guy come from?

5583
05:51:40,560 --> 05:51:41,500
Okay, I'm gonna box.

5584
05:51:43,960 --> 05:51:45,200
But he can't go in this water.

5585
05:51:47,600 --> 05:51:49,300
Oh god.

5586
05:51:49,820 --> 05:51:50,880
I can't.

5587
05:51:51,260 --> 05:51:52,840
I'm like...

5588
05:51:52,840 --> 05:51:54,820
Ration, safety.

5589
05:51:55,480 --> 05:51:56,400
Yeah, goodness.

5590
05:51:57,780 --> 05:51:59,340
Oh my god.

5591
05:52:00,080 --> 05:52:01,200
I can't.

5592
05:52:02,120 --> 05:52:03,280
I hate this game.

5593
05:52:04,920 --> 05:52:06,760
Oh gosh.

5594
05:52:11,820 --> 05:52:13,600
Thank you, Chido-chan.

5595
05:52:13,600 --> 05:52:14,440
Thank you.

5596
05:52:14,540 --> 05:52:15,460
Wait, does he come down here?

5597
05:52:15,560 --> 05:52:16,320
I don't think he does.

5598
05:52:16,920 --> 05:52:18,120
I might be mistaken though.

5599
05:52:28,480 --> 05:52:28,880
Okay.

5600
05:52:29,500 --> 05:52:31,520
We made no mistakes this time.

5601
05:52:33,840 --> 05:52:36,240
There's also another hole trap next to the one you fell into?

5602
05:52:36,360 --> 05:52:37,000
Oh my gosh, really?

5603
05:52:37,100 --> 05:52:37,480
Thank you.

5604
05:52:43,270 --> 05:52:44,470
Is there a way to tell?

5605
05:52:45,110 --> 05:52:46,990
Hold on, we'll look closely and see.

5606
05:52:55,170 --> 05:52:56,730
The floor has the mark, okay.

5607
05:52:58,450 --> 05:52:59,570
I can't.

5608
05:53:00,370 --> 05:53:01,070
Oh, it's a square.

5609
05:53:01,310 --> 05:53:01,910
I see, I see.

5610
05:53:02,130 --> 05:53:03,550
Okay, thank you guys.

5611
05:53:05,190 --> 05:53:05,750
Let's

5612
05:53:21,320 --> 05:53:21,600
eat.

5613
05:53:21,800 --> 05:53:22,100
Ration?

5614
05:53:25,700 --> 05:53:26,860
Grab other ration.

5615
05:53:27,240 --> 05:53:27,500
Perfect.

5616
05:53:28,100 --> 05:53:29,000
Alright, nice.

5617
05:53:29,560 --> 05:53:31,560
Alright, now we're heading back to the elevator.

5618
05:53:31,820 --> 05:53:34,340
That's what the guide told me to do.

5619
05:53:44,580 --> 05:53:45,140
Stealth.

5620
05:53:46,480 --> 05:53:47,480
Was this one fine?

5621
05:54:00,270 --> 05:54:02,210
And then it says...

5622
05:54:02,730 --> 05:54:04,070
Press the button.

5623
05:54:05,450 --> 05:54:06,410
Go berserker mode.

5624
05:54:09,270 --> 05:54:09,990
Alright.

5625
05:54:10,630 --> 05:54:13,330
Call to get key card.

5626
05:54:13,550 --> 05:54:15,210
Go back to elevator, go to second floor.

5627
05:54:15,670 --> 05:54:15,910
Okay.

5628
05:54:16,490 --> 05:54:17,930
I don't care anymore.

5629
05:54:20,310 --> 05:54:24,470
I tried too damn hard to get that stupid Nikita missile.

5630
05:54:25,850 --> 05:54:26,830
Second floor!

5631
05:54:45,170 --> 05:54:45,350
What's that?

5632
05:54:50,550 --> 05:54:51,190
Electricity?

5633
05:54:53,250 --> 05:54:54,490
And there's only... okay.

5634
05:55:07,500 --> 05:55:10,200
I hold my breath sometimes during this.

5635
05:55:12,280 --> 05:55:13,240
Holy moly.

5636
05:55:24,280 --> 05:55:26,400
Wait, are these not...

5637
05:55:32,420 --> 05:55:33,940
Are these not on or something?

5638
05:55:37,900 --> 05:55:39,760
We just go?

5639
05:55:40,040 --> 05:55:40,260
Okay.

5640
05:55:42,000 --> 05:55:43,240
Wait, what the hell?

5641
05:55:46,630 --> 05:55:47,550
Oh my gosh.

5642
05:55:47,790 --> 05:55:48,530
No way.

5643
05:55:49,290 --> 05:55:53,630
I have to figure out which way I'm sliding...

5644
05:55:53,630 --> 05:55:54,410
Oh, there it is!

5645
05:55:54,910 --> 05:55:55,850
There it is!

5646
05:55:57,750 --> 05:55:58,770
So close!

5647
05:56:00,510 --> 05:56:00,870
No!

5648
05:56:02,690 --> 05:56:04,110
Turn sick!

5649
05:56:04,370 --> 05:56:05,810
You can turn!

5650
05:56:05,810 --> 05:56:05,910
You can turn!

5651
05:56:07,850 --> 05:56:09,610
Sister 21!

5652
05:56:10,010 --> 05:56:11,150
Oh my gosh.

5653
05:56:11,290 --> 05:56:12,350
Avaliss, happy birthday!

5654
05:56:13,530 --> 05:56:15,930
Happy birthday to you.

5655
05:56:16,330 --> 05:56:18,830
Happy birthday to you.

5656
05:56:19,130 --> 05:56:22,850
Happy birthday dear Avaliss.

5657
05:56:23,310 --> 05:56:27,030
Happy birthday to you.

5658
05:56:31,770 --> 05:56:34,050
Sorry, I'm trying to figure out this puzzle.

5659
05:56:35,030 --> 05:56:37,310
You have to plan your moves, yeah.

5660
05:56:50,510 --> 05:56:52,210
I just wanna see what's...

5661
05:56:58,400 --> 05:57:00,360
I feel like I have to go here first.

5662
05:57:01,040 --> 05:57:02,560
There's no really other way...

5663
05:57:03,720 --> 05:57:04,940
Top was the right answer.

5664
05:57:05,120 --> 05:57:06,840
Yeah, I have to go this way first.

5665
05:57:15,160 --> 05:57:15,560
But...

5666
05:57:15,560 --> 05:57:19,680
I wish I could like swap, you know, to a different side at least or something.

5667
05:57:20,000 --> 05:57:20,600
Okay, hold on.

5668
05:57:21,040 --> 05:57:21,980
Let's go down some.

5669
05:57:22,560 --> 05:57:23,500
Ah, here we go!

5670
05:57:24,400 --> 05:57:26,020
Okay, I just didn't go down far.

5671
05:57:26,360 --> 05:57:26,820
Or, no.

5672
05:57:27,940 --> 05:57:28,400
Just kidding.

5673
05:57:32,200 --> 05:57:32,740
Stop!

5674
05:57:33,460 --> 05:57:34,020
There we go.

5675
05:57:35,180 --> 05:57:36,520
Slippery slaughter daddy!

5676
05:57:36,700 --> 05:57:37,380
Welcome to Mamba Japan!

5677
05:57:38,240 --> 05:57:41,580
Okay, and then this way.

5678
05:57:43,460 --> 05:57:49,520
Over, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, over.

5679
05:57:50,480 --> 05:57:52,760
And either I can continue... Oh, what's over here?

5680
05:57:56,800 --> 05:57:57,780
What's in here?

5681
05:57:58,820 --> 05:57:59,700
Ah, that's right.

5682
05:58:01,880 --> 05:58:02,720
Let me back in!

5683
05:58:02,880 --> 05:58:03,320
Let me back in!

5684
05:58:09,990 --> 05:58:13,910
Is there any... I don't think there's a way to go up right now.

5685
05:58:14,130 --> 05:58:16,130
Okay, I think I have to go that way.

5686
05:58:30,780 --> 05:58:31,800
Where's my boxer?

5687
05:58:31,800 --> 05:58:31,920
There.

5688
05:58:34,520 --> 05:58:36,840
Alright, let's see what this guy does.

5689
05:58:37,880 --> 05:58:39,800
He walks up here...

5690
05:58:40,480 --> 05:58:42,800
And then he turns...

5691
05:58:44,020 --> 05:58:45,220
And then...

5692
05:58:45,540 --> 05:58:48,080
Goes down there...

5693
05:58:48,080 --> 05:58:50,300
And he turns...

5694
05:58:50,300 --> 05:58:52,180
And... What is over here anyway?

5695
05:58:52,480 --> 05:58:53,400
Oh, a sleepy guy.

5696
05:58:55,920 --> 05:58:56,960
Sleepy guy!

5697
05:59:03,980 --> 05:59:05,240
Okay, let's try this.

5698
05:59:09,490 --> 05:59:10,010
Nice.

5699
05:59:18,770 --> 05:59:19,550
Oh no.

5700
05:59:25,100 --> 05:59:25,620
Ammunition.

5701
05:59:26,740 --> 05:59:27,000
Run!

5702
05:59:33,370 --> 05:59:35,150
I almost didn't see him there.

5703
05:59:51,160 --> 05:59:56,060
Maybe I can knock him out and then run and go explore before he wakes up.

5704
05:59:58,960 --> 06:00:00,180
What is that?

5705
06:00:00,400 --> 06:00:01,900
Oh, this is a place to crawl.

5706
06:00:02,220 --> 06:00:02,580
Crawl!

5707
06:00:04,100 --> 06:00:04,980
Just crawl!

5708
06:00:06,840 --> 06:00:08,820
Alright, we're good everybody.

5709
06:00:09,860 --> 06:00:15,700
We're following, we're walking around, we're finding places, we're crawling through vents.

5710
06:00:32,290 --> 06:00:33,390
And where does it go?

5711
06:00:34,210 --> 06:00:34,930
Nice!

5712
06:00:36,310 --> 06:00:37,150
Wait, what's this?

5713
06:00:39,130 --> 06:00:39,910
No one's in here.

5714
06:00:41,250 --> 06:00:42,590
Body armor!

5715
06:00:43,410 --> 06:00:44,450
That's huge.

5716
06:00:44,490 --> 06:00:45,630
More C4, let's go.

5717
06:00:47,670 --> 06:00:49,070
Body armor is huge.

5718
06:00:50,470 --> 06:00:52,350
Wait, where do I shimmy?

5719
06:00:57,900 --> 06:00:58,400
Wait.

5720
06:00:59,200 --> 06:01:01,520
No, I'm in the wrong shimmying position.

5721
06:01:02,620 --> 06:01:03,120
No!

5722
06:01:07,580 --> 06:01:11,200
Okay, I think I have to crawl all the way back.

5723
06:01:11,600 --> 06:01:13,940
And then I have to go past the guard.

5724
06:01:15,980 --> 06:01:16,980
Back through the vent.

5725
06:01:17,060 --> 06:01:18,820
At least I got the body armor, that's good.

5726
06:01:20,180 --> 06:01:23,400
La la la la la la...

5727
06:01:27,460 --> 06:01:34,820
At least when the guards fall asleep, from me punching them, they don't wake up and be like...

5728
06:01:35,520 --> 06:01:38,740
You know, they don't get angry about it, they just fall asleep.

5729
06:01:39,000 --> 06:01:39,980
It's pretty nice actually.

5730
06:01:43,940 --> 06:01:44,580
See?

5731
06:01:45,980 --> 06:01:46,940
Fell asleep.

5732
06:01:52,780 --> 06:01:53,540
Wait, here.

5733
06:01:53,720 --> 06:01:54,200
There we go.

5734
06:01:55,440 --> 06:01:55,880
Okay.

5735
06:01:57,760 --> 06:01:58,640
Lucky, lucky.

5736
06:02:05,200 --> 06:02:05,640
Okay.

5737
06:02:05,640 --> 06:02:07,160
Yeah, I think...

5738
06:02:07,160 --> 06:02:08,340
Wait, I think we go here.

5739
06:02:10,140 --> 06:02:11,400
And then maybe this way.

5740
06:02:13,500 --> 06:02:14,700
Nope, just kidding.

5741
06:02:15,500 --> 06:02:16,800
There you go, it's downwards.

5742
06:02:20,340 --> 06:02:21,840
I don't think so either.

5743
06:02:22,000 --> 06:02:22,880
No, that's where I came from.

5744
06:02:22,940 --> 06:02:23,420
I'm an idiot.

5745
06:02:24,820 --> 06:02:25,420
This way.

5746
06:02:26,040 --> 06:02:27,240
We go all the way to the top.

5747
06:02:29,340 --> 06:02:29,780
Yes.

5748
06:02:31,440 --> 06:02:31,880
Okay.

5749
06:02:34,440 --> 06:02:36,920
I don't recall how I got on the floor, must be nothing.

5750
06:02:37,240 --> 06:02:37,920
Yeah, exactly.

5751
06:02:39,080 --> 06:02:39,780
They're just silly.

5752
06:02:40,400 --> 06:02:42,540
I don't really think about how they got there.

5753
06:02:45,760 --> 06:02:46,700
They're silly, silly.

5754
06:02:48,080 --> 06:02:49,860
Oh my god, we're so close.

5755
06:02:50,500 --> 06:02:51,200
Wait a second.

5756
06:02:52,280 --> 06:02:53,420
No, this is different.

5757
06:02:55,720 --> 06:02:56,360
Wait.

5758
06:02:57,540 --> 06:02:59,860
No, this is the same...

5759
06:03:00,920 --> 06:03:01,560
Joy!

5760
06:03:02,060 --> 06:03:03,280
Oh my gosh, thanks for the 50!

5761
06:03:10,010 --> 06:03:11,910
Down you could go left, I could.

5762
06:03:13,390 --> 06:03:13,730
Here?

5763
06:03:18,820 --> 06:03:19,420
Where?

5764
06:03:30,560 --> 06:03:32,160
Right then down left.

5765
06:03:36,220 --> 06:03:37,320
Wait, here?

5766
06:03:40,020 --> 06:03:40,920
Oh, I see.

5767
06:03:41,160 --> 06:03:42,040
Oh, I missed that.

5768
06:03:42,180 --> 06:03:43,180
I missed the left over there.

5769
06:03:43,280 --> 06:03:44,200
Okay, thank you, thank you guys.

5770
06:03:44,580 --> 06:03:45,260
I see it, I see it.

5771
06:03:47,060 --> 06:03:47,820
I missed it.

5772
06:03:47,920 --> 06:03:48,500
Right here.

5773
06:03:48,780 --> 06:03:49,620
I see it, I see it.

5774
06:03:51,640 --> 06:03:52,280
Right here.

5775
06:03:52,580 --> 06:03:54,020
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

5776
06:03:56,500 --> 06:03:56,820
Nice!

5777
06:03:58,900 --> 06:03:59,540
Good eyes.

5778
06:03:59,620 --> 06:04:03,320
Oh my gosh, it kind of looks like his butt is like twerking against the...

5779
06:04:05,340 --> 06:04:07,380
Whoa, spreading those cheeks.

5780
06:04:07,920 --> 06:04:09,120
Go snake, go!

5781
06:04:13,400 --> 06:04:17,360
Okay, and then we...

5782
06:04:17,360 --> 06:04:17,940
This way.

5783
06:04:18,380 --> 06:04:18,560
Up.

5784
06:04:24,010 --> 06:04:24,790
This is it.

5785
06:04:25,430 --> 06:04:27,050
This is the run!

5786
06:04:30,130 --> 06:04:30,870
Yeah!

5787
06:04:31,330 --> 06:04:32,470
We made it!

5788
06:04:38,500 --> 06:04:40,600
It's not the Nikita missile?

5789
06:04:48,680 --> 06:04:51,420
Wait, you don't think I needed to chaff there?

5790
06:04:53,280 --> 06:04:57,380
Wait, did I just only need to chaff at that one spot?

5791
06:04:58,340 --> 06:05:00,500
And it would disarm the electricity?

5792
06:05:03,180 --> 06:05:08,660
Oh, I had chaffs this entire time!

5793
06:05:11,000 --> 06:05:11,880
No!

5794
06:05:13,440 --> 06:05:14,020
No!

5795
06:05:15,200 --> 06:05:15,660
No!

5796
06:05:15,660 --> 06:05:17,480
This can't be right.

5797
06:05:17,580 --> 06:05:18,220
I'm drunk.

5798
06:05:18,360 --> 06:05:19,940
Don't super chat and drunk!

5799
06:05:20,800 --> 06:05:21,740
I mean drink!

5800
06:05:22,220 --> 06:05:23,260
Thank you, Joy!

5801
06:05:29,210 --> 06:05:32,430
Carry on to the northwest is what... Wait, northwest.

5802
06:05:33,590 --> 06:05:34,770
Northwest, here?

5803
06:05:37,430 --> 06:05:38,070
Here?

5804
06:05:39,450 --> 06:05:41,930
This is east, this is not northwest.

5805
06:05:43,790 --> 06:05:45,670
How do I get to that little area?

5806
06:05:53,710 --> 06:05:56,050
This doesn't count as an open area, does it?

5807
06:05:56,930 --> 06:05:57,210
No?

5808
06:05:58,810 --> 06:06:00,150
You can go down again.

5809
06:06:03,410 --> 06:06:08,850
But the guide says grab the chaff grenades, carry on, and open the door to the northwest.

5810
06:06:12,940 --> 06:06:14,620
Is the guide wrong?

5811
06:06:15,540 --> 06:06:16,720
Take the Nikita.

5812
06:06:17,360 --> 06:06:18,200
Wait, what?

5813
06:06:22,720 --> 06:06:24,920
Left of those two crates here?

5814
06:06:25,920 --> 06:06:27,580
Isn't this where I came in from?

5815
06:06:31,780 --> 06:06:34,500
Wait, northwest.

5816
06:06:40,520 --> 06:06:44,040
Now this should be it.

5817
06:06:44,520 --> 06:06:45,180
Okay, here we go.

5818
06:06:46,980 --> 06:06:48,720
Goodness gracious.

5819
06:06:50,820 --> 06:06:51,520
Wait, wait.

5820
06:07:07,390 --> 06:07:09,130
Actually, I'm just going to equip the body armor.

5821
06:07:10,570 --> 06:07:12,030
What is this person doing, anyway?

5822
06:07:14,970 --> 06:07:15,970
They're wandering.

5823
06:07:17,170 --> 06:07:19,710
They're taking a little walk, a little stroll.

5824
06:07:21,410 --> 06:07:21,950
What's this?

5825
06:07:23,030 --> 06:07:23,830
Oh, come on.

5826
06:07:27,500 --> 06:07:28,000
Here?

5827
06:07:31,680 --> 06:07:32,740
Where is it?

5828
06:07:33,560 --> 06:07:34,120
Where?

5829
06:07:43,020 --> 06:07:44,460
Is it in this corner?

5830
06:08:01,140 --> 06:08:03,000
Oh my goodness.

5831
06:08:04,400 --> 06:08:07,300
Nikita, B to fire, control with D-pad.

5832
06:08:07,780 --> 06:08:08,160
Okay.

5833
06:08:12,770 --> 06:08:14,150
Oh, that was close.

5834
06:08:15,590 --> 06:08:20,360
I don't think anybody will come.

5835
06:08:31,520 --> 06:08:32,240
Nice.

5836
06:08:33,400 --> 06:08:34,000
This

5837
06:08:43,720 --> 06:08:44,580
is part of the mission!

5838
06:08:44,580 --> 06:08:46,120
Oh, I'm so dead.

5839
06:08:47,200 --> 06:08:48,860
Evade and disappear.

5840
06:08:49,140 --> 06:08:49,620
Go away.

5841
06:08:50,220 --> 06:08:51,000
I hate you.

5842
06:08:51,620 --> 06:08:53,780
Please, please don't do this to me.

5843
06:08:54,180 --> 06:08:54,280
Yeah.

5844
06:08:55,260 --> 06:08:56,080
Fuck you.

5845
06:09:19,320 --> 06:09:19,580
Ouch.

5846
06:09:19,760 --> 06:09:25,330
Oh my god, let me through!

5847
06:09:46,280 --> 06:09:47,620
Dumb every time.

5848
06:09:57,950 --> 06:09:58,330
Okay.

5849
06:09:59,430 --> 06:10:01,110
We can leave this floor.

5850
06:10:04,050 --> 06:10:05,410
Holy cannoli.

5851
06:10:05,970 --> 06:10:07,250
Who needs stealth anyway?

5852
06:10:07,390 --> 06:10:07,790
Exactly.

5853
06:10:08,670 --> 06:10:10,430
So I guess we go to the first floor.

5854
06:10:14,270 --> 06:10:15,150
And we...

5855
06:10:15,970 --> 06:10:17,930
I gotta go get some more water soon.

5856
06:10:34,630 --> 06:10:35,630
Is this a wall?

5857
06:10:35,770 --> 06:10:37,570
Wait, how many missiles do I have left?

5858
06:10:37,730 --> 06:10:39,410
I accidentally wasted one.

5859
06:10:40,410 --> 06:10:41,390
I have five.

5860
06:10:46,680 --> 06:10:48,580
Maybe I shoot down this way instead.

5861
06:10:49,180 --> 06:10:50,220
Okay, I think I should...

5862
06:10:50,220 --> 06:10:50,540
What?

5863
06:10:50,660 --> 06:10:51,820
I wasn't even...

5864
06:10:51,820 --> 06:10:52,680
Shut up.

5865
06:10:52,840 --> 06:10:53,660
Shut up, game.

5866
06:10:54,180 --> 06:10:54,860
Okay, here we go.

5867
06:11:23,530 --> 06:11:24,870
What do I do?

5868
06:11:38,500 --> 06:11:40,560
It went rogue, you guys!

5869
06:11:40,740 --> 06:11:41,960
I couldn't do anything!

5870
06:11:43,000 --> 06:11:44,380
It went rogue!

5871
06:11:45,340 --> 06:11:45,800
Okay.

5872
06:11:46,460 --> 06:11:47,180
Gosh.

5873
06:11:53,860 --> 06:11:54,580
Okay.

5874
06:11:57,720 --> 06:11:58,300
Go!

5875
06:12:02,980 --> 06:12:03,900
Oh my god.

5876
06:12:06,680 --> 06:12:07,640
I can't...

5877
06:12:07,640 --> 06:12:07,880
I

5878
06:12:11,840 --> 06:12:15,020
can't win this game!

5879
06:12:18,700 --> 06:12:21,200
You don't think there's gonna be more guys down here, right?

5880
06:12:21,300 --> 06:12:21,500
Okay.

5881
06:12:22,680 --> 06:12:24,340
Might as well just go with it.

5882
06:12:41,930 --> 06:12:43,330
The shy missile.

5883
06:13:00,280 --> 06:13:01,760
Okay, you think they're gone?

5884
06:13:02,280 --> 06:13:03,560
You think the people are gone?

5885
06:13:06,280 --> 06:13:08,400
I honestly can't tell at all.

5886
06:13:33,160 --> 06:13:35,060
I can't even shimmy under it!

5887
06:13:36,920 --> 06:13:38,800
No, do I just... Oh, chaff.

5888
06:13:38,880 --> 06:13:39,600
Yeah, it's chaff.

5889
06:13:40,500 --> 06:13:42,260
Thank you, I forgot that I picked those up.

5890
06:13:43,720 --> 06:13:45,360
Are they under this?

5891
06:13:46,320 --> 06:13:46,660
No.

5892
06:13:47,800 --> 06:13:48,680
They're under this.

5893
06:13:49,000 --> 06:13:49,460
It's done.

5894
06:13:52,690 --> 06:13:53,850
And I just...

5895
06:13:54,670 --> 06:13:56,930
I throw with the beat.

5896
06:14:04,900 --> 06:14:06,920
I miss not having the...

5897
06:14:07,700 --> 06:14:09,400
The things go crazy, you know?

5898
06:14:11,500 --> 06:14:13,360
It's fine when they go so crazy.

5899
06:14:17,300 --> 06:14:17,780
No?

5900
06:14:17,940 --> 06:14:18,420
Still boo-boo?

5901
06:14:18,920 --> 06:14:19,240
Okay.

5902
06:14:19,340 --> 06:14:19,980
Oh my god!

5903
06:14:30,570 --> 06:14:31,650
Oh, he's down there.

5904
06:14:31,730 --> 06:14:31,930
Okay.

5905
06:14:32,670 --> 06:14:33,910
I got mistaken.

5906
06:14:34,150 --> 06:14:34,870
I got mistaken.

5907
06:14:37,670 --> 06:14:40,650
It's weird because it doesn't show this hole in the wall, you know?

5908
06:14:54,320 --> 06:14:56,140
The luckiest person...

5909
06:14:56,900 --> 06:14:57,820
In the world!

5910
06:15:05,160 --> 06:15:06,240
Oh my god, stop!

5911
06:15:08,080 --> 06:15:10,320
How am I the luckiest person in the world?

5912
06:15:11,280 --> 06:15:12,360
Oh my god!

5913
06:15:12,840 --> 06:15:13,760
Did I go through?

5914
06:15:13,900 --> 06:15:15,520
This is where I'm supposed to go though, right?

5915
06:15:17,300 --> 06:15:17,740
Gosh.

5916
06:15:18,440 --> 06:15:19,600
Oh my god!

5917
06:15:19,960 --> 06:15:20,480
Oh my god!

5918
06:15:20,520 --> 06:15:21,040
Oh my god!

5919
06:15:21,040 --> 06:15:22,320
Oh my god!

5920
06:15:22,400 --> 06:15:22,820
Oh my god!

5921
06:15:22,840 --> 06:15:23,340
Oh my god!

5922
06:15:23,360 --> 06:15:23,860
Oh my god!

5923
06:15:23,940 --> 06:15:24,680
Oh my god!

5924
06:15:25,360 --> 06:15:26,240
Oh my god!

5925
06:15:26,400 --> 06:15:26,840
Oh my god!

5926
06:15:27,240 --> 06:15:28,720
Oh my god!

5927
06:15:31,780 --> 06:15:33,240
Literally pixel perfect.

5928
06:15:38,180 --> 06:15:41,660
I wasted all my luck for the year with that one single...

5929
06:15:42,400 --> 06:15:44,660
With that one single...

5930
06:15:45,920 --> 06:15:46,280
Moment.

5931
06:15:47,540 --> 06:15:50,600
I hope this is the way because it's really long.

5932
06:16:00,600 --> 06:16:01,440
Nikita ammo.

5933
06:16:03,560 --> 06:16:04,080
And...

5934
06:16:04,080 --> 06:16:05,360
Nikita ammo.

5935
06:16:11,700 --> 06:16:14,440
There's no reason to make it this long.

5936
06:16:14,860 --> 06:16:15,540
There's no reason.

5937
06:16:15,720 --> 06:16:16,360
It's just...

5938
06:16:18,240 --> 06:16:18,760
So...unnecessary.

5939
06:16:18,880 --> 06:16:20,100
Destroy the control panel.

5940
06:16:20,460 --> 06:16:21,240
Wait, there was one?

5941
06:16:22,460 --> 06:16:23,560
Oh, there was a panel.

5942
06:16:23,820 --> 06:16:24,480
Oh my god.

5943
06:16:24,600 --> 06:16:25,220
Thank you guys.

5944
06:16:26,640 --> 06:16:27,240
Wait, where?

5945
06:16:28,760 --> 06:16:29,560
Where?

5946
06:16:30,320 --> 06:16:31,000
And

5947
06:16:41,010 --> 06:16:43,250
then it's gonna go...

5948
06:17:02,230 --> 06:17:04,290
Can I only Nikita these?

5949
06:17:14,190 --> 06:17:14,590
Where?

5950
06:17:15,570 --> 06:17:15,970
Okay.

5951
06:17:17,370 --> 06:17:17,970
Weird.

5952
06:17:19,250 --> 06:17:20,590
Alright, well I did it.

5953
06:17:29,670 --> 06:17:32,090
Only Nikitas are so precise.

5954
06:17:32,990 --> 06:17:34,350
It can't be any explosion.

5955
06:17:34,710 --> 06:17:37,550
It has to be THE explosion.

5956
06:17:38,210 --> 06:17:40,150
The one explosion.

5957
06:17:43,600 --> 06:17:49,480
Okay, well I guess I'm glad that there was a purpose to this madness.

5958
06:17:50,060 --> 06:17:52,880
And now I know we came from the right, but can we go up?

5959
06:17:55,660 --> 06:17:57,240
Let's go to the left.

5960
06:18:02,770 --> 06:18:03,550
And down.

5961
06:18:04,870 --> 06:18:06,650
This part is really long, huh?

5962
06:18:07,970 --> 06:18:11,230
I thought the box level was long, but...

5963
06:18:11,230 --> 06:18:13,230
Oh, I'm here again!

5964
06:18:19,140 --> 06:18:20,580
Wait, unless...hold on.

5965
06:18:21,700 --> 06:18:22,460
Wait, let me see.

5966
06:18:23,280 --> 06:18:24,040
No, nevermind.

5967
06:18:24,100 --> 06:18:25,100
Sorry, I made a mistake.

5968
06:18:25,560 --> 06:18:26,540
This is a different place.

5969
06:18:27,180 --> 06:18:28,100
I saw the...

5970
06:18:30,320 --> 06:18:33,240
I saw the ration and I got confused.

5971
06:18:34,160 --> 06:18:34,440
Okay.

5972
06:18:35,860 --> 06:18:36,460
Card.

5973
06:18:37,360 --> 06:18:38,020
Still no?

5974
06:18:38,200 --> 06:18:38,480
Okay.

5975
06:18:47,720 --> 06:18:48,780
5.7 ammo.

5976
06:18:49,700 --> 06:18:51,360
Oh, there's another control panel.

5977
06:18:55,680 --> 06:18:56,600
Just run for it.

5978
06:18:58,660 --> 06:19:00,040
Wonder if we can get this one too.

5979
06:19:02,680 --> 06:19:03,460
Yeah, maybe.

5980
06:19:04,560 --> 06:19:04,960
Okay.

5981
06:19:05,460 --> 06:19:06,520
It was right over there, right?

5982
06:19:07,200 --> 06:19:09,460
It was right over there, right there, right there, right...

5983
06:19:10,680 --> 06:19:11,080
There.

5984
06:19:12,740 --> 06:19:14,960
There's gonna be a lot of cars that run.

5985
06:19:15,400 --> 06:19:15,800
Why?

5986
06:19:16,300 --> 06:19:17,420
Why is that a mechanic?

5987
06:19:17,800 --> 06:19:22,560
They're like, what if we made the parts with the electric floor even more difficult?

5988
06:19:22,680 --> 06:19:25,380
What if you shot any gun in the...

5989
06:19:31,740 --> 06:19:34,100
In the game, it sounds an alarm.

5990
06:20:02,780 --> 06:20:04,280
Will it get shot down if I go straight?

5991
06:20:06,960 --> 06:20:08,700
Maybe I have to, like, go through a maze.

5992
06:20:09,580 --> 06:20:11,120
They're like, it's too easy if you just...

5993
06:20:16,570 --> 06:20:19,050
I'm gonna... Oh, okay, I have more missiles.

5994
06:20:26,260 --> 06:20:27,640
Chaff and Nikita?

5995
06:20:32,160 --> 06:20:34,780
You guys are so smart!

5996
06:20:36,100 --> 06:20:37,720
You guys are so smart!

5997
06:20:39,960 --> 06:20:40,800
Chaff?

5998
06:20:51,990 --> 06:20:52,390
Why?

5999
06:20:54,910 --> 06:20:58,170
I can't chaff and... Okay, well, uh...

6000
06:21:00,730 --> 06:21:02,410
I guess I can't do that.

6001
06:21:06,050 --> 06:21:08,630
I think I have to make it so that they're not active.

6002
06:21:13,130 --> 06:21:14,130
It was a good idea.

6003
06:21:14,250 --> 06:21:15,130
It was a very good idea.

6004
06:21:16,570 --> 06:21:20,730
But I guess it makes sense that, like, the Nikita is controlled by...

6005
06:21:21,870 --> 06:21:23,630
Gosh, I wish I could... Okay, hold on.

6006
06:21:24,430 --> 06:21:26,530
Alright, I have to go down that way, but...

6007
06:21:26,530 --> 06:21:29,010
How will I avoid the ones on the...

6008
06:21:29,010 --> 06:21:32,090
Maybe the ones on the left aren't gun cameras, you know?

6009
06:21:37,850 --> 06:21:38,730
Actually, they were.

6010
06:21:38,850 --> 06:21:40,550
Because I saw one at the very bottom.

6011
06:21:52,660 --> 06:21:54,900
From the left room is easier for me?

6012
06:21:55,160 --> 06:21:55,720
Over there?

6013
06:21:55,720 --> 06:21:57,720
How do you get it from there?

6014
06:22:07,070 --> 06:22:08,070
I shall see.

6015
06:22:09,390 --> 06:22:10,370
I'm gonna go in a circle.

6016
06:22:23,700 --> 06:22:25,240
Like, behind the...

6017
06:22:32,180 --> 06:22:33,440
Across the pit there's no wall.

6018
06:22:33,940 --> 06:22:35,440
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

6019
06:22:37,220 --> 06:22:38,240
That's untrue.

6020
06:22:52,240 --> 06:22:55,620
You know what, this is fine, because I wasted a lot of ammo.

6021
06:23:01,230 --> 06:23:02,170
And we get more.

6022
06:23:03,290 --> 06:23:04,450
Okay, this is fine, actually.

6023
06:23:10,490 --> 06:23:13,030
The strat was to get the... Oh, that's right.

6024
06:23:13,450 --> 06:23:14,390
Was to get more.

6025
06:23:14,670 --> 06:23:14,830
Okay.

6026
06:23:26,680 --> 06:23:27,120
Wait.

6027
06:23:32,340 --> 06:23:33,680
But how do I get back...

6028
06:23:35,200 --> 06:23:36,920
Ah, they didn't shoot it, though.

6029
06:23:37,100 --> 06:23:37,320
Okay.

6030
06:23:38,680 --> 06:23:40,600
The dapper sapper, welcome to membership!

6031
06:23:47,180 --> 06:23:50,120
I have to... I think I have to wait for them to calm down, though.

6032
06:23:53,540 --> 06:23:54,240
Maybe it's fine.

6033
06:23:55,900 --> 06:23:56,880
Yeah, they're fine now.

6034
06:23:57,660 --> 06:24:00,680
Because I think they shoot from... They have, like, a higher... I don't know.

6035
06:24:01,220 --> 06:24:02,680
Maybe... Maybe it just...

6036
06:24:03,880 --> 06:24:04,680
Oh, that's right.

6037
06:24:18,120 --> 06:24:22,180
This has been a sanity draining past few days for me, so...

6038
06:24:22,660 --> 06:24:24,260
I need a break next week.

6039
06:24:24,560 --> 06:24:26,440
But Batara is coming over!

6040
06:24:31,640 --> 06:24:33,920
I can't catch a break.

6041
06:24:35,660 --> 06:24:38,020
And I'm even... I'm doing it to myself.

6042
06:24:41,880 --> 06:24:42,700
Oh, that's right.

6043
06:24:45,120 --> 06:24:46,820
Do I have to go under it?

6044
06:24:48,120 --> 06:24:48,320
What?

6045
06:25:08,730 --> 06:25:12,650
Cameras can shoot missiles while they're going slow, but not when they're going fast.

6046
06:25:12,730 --> 06:25:15,050
I know, that's why it's so tricky in that part.

6047
06:25:15,190 --> 06:25:16,810
Okay, I'm gonna have to, like...

6048
06:25:17,730 --> 06:25:18,150
Okay.

6049
06:25:21,450 --> 06:25:24,370
I'm gonna have to angle it in the most...

6050
06:25:27,010 --> 06:25:28,930
How do I get it to go fast there?

6051
06:25:29,510 --> 06:25:32,350
To speed up... There's... But I have to turn there.

6052
06:25:33,650 --> 06:25:36,310
Maybe I have to be all the way...

6053
06:25:37,370 --> 06:25:38,510
Okay, I think I see where.

6054
06:25:38,730 --> 06:25:39,430
Okay, hold on.

6055
06:25:50,000 --> 06:25:50,520
Fast!

6056
06:25:51,640 --> 06:25:53,860
No, I was going fast!

6057
06:25:54,900 --> 06:25:56,020
That's so unfair!

6058
06:25:57,500 --> 06:25:59,280
I don't think I hit the desk.

6059
06:26:03,710 --> 06:26:05,570
I hit the wall, actually.

6060
06:26:25,590 --> 06:26:28,370
Maybe I was just, like, pixel perfect hitting it.

6061
06:26:31,690 --> 06:26:32,210
Okay.

6062
06:26:33,250 --> 06:26:34,050
Oh, shoot.

6063
06:26:36,970 --> 06:26:40,050
Why does it have to be... This is... I don't feel like...

6064
06:26:40,590 --> 06:26:44,750
I don't feel like they would make it that it has to be pixel perfect to get through.

6065
06:26:45,390 --> 06:26:47,250
I feel like I'm missing something.

6066
06:26:47,450 --> 06:26:48,590
I'm doing something wrong.

6067
06:26:48,830 --> 06:26:50,050
Like, I actually...

6068
06:26:50,990 --> 06:26:54,270
Like, I'm sitting here, like, crafting...

6069
06:26:54,270 --> 06:26:54,970
Shit.

6070
06:27:01,780 --> 06:27:02,960
Oh, my God.

6071
06:27:03,500 --> 06:27:07,320
If I'm over to the right or to the left anymore, I'm gonna hit the first wall.

6072
06:27:07,980 --> 06:27:08,700
Oh, my God.

6073
06:27:09,460 --> 06:27:12,080
Okay, I have two shots left before I kill myself.

6074
06:27:19,540 --> 06:27:21,000
In Metal Gear.

6075
06:27:30,030 --> 06:27:31,450
There is another route?

6076
06:27:31,570 --> 06:27:32,130
There is?

6077
06:27:32,230 --> 06:27:34,030
I don't think there is.

6078
06:27:37,470 --> 06:27:39,350
Okay, on the...

6079
06:27:39,350 --> 06:27:40,210
Maybe, like...

6080
06:27:42,790 --> 06:27:44,850
Sayonara, cruel world!

6081
06:27:59,150 --> 06:28:01,610
The guide I'm looking at uses this route.

6082
06:28:01,810 --> 06:28:04,310
I don't... Yeah, the other route shoots you down.

6083
06:28:04,430 --> 06:28:07,870
This one... This one seems to be the only one that works.

6084
06:28:09,430 --> 06:28:13,070
It's just so... I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.

6085
06:28:15,630 --> 06:28:18,470
Turn after passing the first security system.

6086
06:28:19,750 --> 06:28:20,310
Turn?

6087
06:28:21,470 --> 06:28:21,990
Wait.

6088
06:28:24,430 --> 06:28:25,550
See, like...

6089
06:28:28,510 --> 06:28:34,570
I'm trying to get it along the line that you see right next to the desk.

6090
06:28:34,770 --> 06:28:36,310
But it hits the desk.

6091
06:28:37,770 --> 06:28:39,830
And if I turn in front of the...

6092
06:28:41,090 --> 06:28:42,830
In front of the thing...

6093
06:28:46,290 --> 06:28:48,990
Unless I get past the first camera and immediately...

6094
06:28:48,990 --> 06:28:52,750
Okay, I'll get past the first camera and turn immediately.

6095
06:28:52,950 --> 06:28:53,570
Go to the right?

6096
06:28:53,650 --> 06:28:54,670
I don't think that's a route.

6097
06:28:56,370 --> 06:28:57,190
Oh

6098
06:29:08,060 --> 06:29:08,760
my gosh!

6099
06:29:08,840 --> 06:29:09,300
Yippee!

6100
06:29:09,940 --> 06:29:13,540
I just need my...

6101
06:29:14,120 --> 06:29:15,320
My mic.

6102
06:29:15,480 --> 06:29:16,020
Oh my gosh.

6103
06:29:16,440 --> 06:29:16,740
Yay!

6104
06:29:17,500 --> 06:29:19,520
First try in the...

6105
06:29:19,520 --> 06:29:21,960
In the new life.

6106
06:29:22,320 --> 06:29:22,780
Goodness.

6107
06:29:23,300 --> 06:29:23,900
Thank goodness.

6108
06:29:26,080 --> 06:29:26,380
Huh.

6109
06:29:26,900 --> 06:29:30,760
Why sometimes it would shoot it down and other times it doesn't?

6110
06:29:31,280 --> 06:29:32,000
It's a mystery.

6111
06:29:33,300 --> 06:29:34,120
It's a mystery.

6112
06:29:35,840 --> 06:29:37,680
To me, it's a mystery.

6113
06:29:41,200 --> 06:29:42,580
Sick spin, Snake.

6114
06:29:44,980 --> 06:29:45,460
Okay.

6115
06:29:46,580 --> 06:29:47,500
Now, chaff.

6116
06:29:54,140 --> 06:29:55,040
Oh, there we go.

6117
06:29:57,380 --> 06:29:58,880
I don't know what I'm doing in here.

6118
06:29:59,160 --> 06:30:00,300
I don't know what my goal is.

6119
06:30:02,300 --> 06:30:02,780
But...

6120
06:30:03,440 --> 06:30:03,980
I'm in here.

6121
06:30:04,360 --> 06:30:05,000
Oh, maybe this?

6122
06:30:05,960 --> 06:30:06,440
C4?

6123
06:30:06,640 --> 06:30:07,620
I already had that.

6124
06:30:08,640 --> 06:30:09,380
And what's this?

6125
06:30:11,020 --> 06:30:12,220
R5 ammunition?

6126
06:30:12,460 --> 06:30:13,400
I guess I need that.

6127
06:30:15,760 --> 06:30:17,240
Oh, there's a door here.

6128
06:30:21,200 --> 06:30:22,640
Back to the game.

6129
06:30:32,340 --> 06:30:32,940
Save?

6130
06:30:33,180 --> 06:30:33,800
Good idea.

6131
06:30:36,660 --> 06:30:38,940
I'm gonna save and I'm also gonna get some water.

6132
06:30:40,500 --> 06:30:40,800
Ouch.

6133
06:30:41,660 --> 06:30:42,620
Need anything?

6134
06:30:43,120 --> 06:30:44,580
Yeah, I need sanity.

6135
06:30:46,040 --> 06:30:47,660
Ever heard of this?

6136
06:30:48,300 --> 06:30:49,800
Dr. Coplethorne says...

6137
06:30:50,500 --> 06:30:52,640
Okay, I'll go through it, but...

6138
06:30:52,640 --> 06:30:53,800
Oh, Mei Ling, you're...

6139
06:30:54,960 --> 06:30:55,980
Never mind me.

6140
06:30:56,420 --> 06:30:57,820
Tell me about yourself.

6141
06:30:58,100 --> 06:31:01,300
Oh, why'd she flip the script on us?

6142
06:31:01,960 --> 06:31:02,160
Me?

6143
06:31:04,220 --> 06:31:07,380
Like, why you're back in combat?

6144
06:31:10,060 --> 06:31:13,740
I've heard that you've given up the military.

6145
06:31:17,700 --> 06:31:19,500
Did the colonel tell you that?

6146
06:31:22,040 --> 06:31:22,520
Uh-huh.

6147
06:31:22,860 --> 06:31:24,000
And other things too.

6148
06:31:24,900 --> 06:31:25,960
Like what?

6149
06:31:27,340 --> 06:31:29,380
Like the bandana...

6150
06:31:30,000 --> 06:31:32,360
Wait, the bandana underwear?

6151
06:31:36,580 --> 06:31:38,040
Bandana underwear?

6152
06:31:43,620 --> 06:31:44,640
Let me see!

6153
06:31:46,280 --> 06:31:48,180
And barbecued bugs?

6154
06:31:49,460 --> 06:31:50,220
And...

6155
06:31:50,220 --> 06:31:51,500
That stuff too?

6156
06:31:52,000 --> 06:31:52,700
Oh God!

6157
06:31:53,300 --> 06:31:54,820
That blabber mouth.

6158
06:31:57,380 --> 06:31:58,900
Bandana underwear!

6159
06:31:59,820 --> 06:32:01,520
Why has no one ever told me this before?

6160
06:32:02,540 --> 06:32:03,980
So, why did you come back?

6161
06:32:05,400 --> 06:32:06,960
I had something to finish.

6162
06:32:07,600 --> 06:32:10,340
And decided to stop running away.

6163
06:32:16,180 --> 06:32:17,160
That's all.

6164
06:32:18,880 --> 06:32:20,040
And after that?

6165
06:32:21,180 --> 06:32:21,780
After?

6166
06:32:23,440 --> 06:32:24,400
When it's finished?

6167
06:32:26,420 --> 06:32:27,920
What are you going to do?

6168
06:32:30,380 --> 06:32:31,900
This makes me so sad.

6169
06:32:33,920 --> 06:32:35,420
I think about 4.

6170
06:32:36,560 --> 06:32:38,040
And it makes me so sad.

6171
06:32:39,880 --> 06:32:41,580
SMH can't believe Madi never drew that.

6172
06:32:41,660 --> 06:32:43,040
And she played Ghost Babble!

6173
06:32:49,770 --> 06:32:52,510
I haven't thought about it.

6174
06:32:57,730 --> 06:32:59,830
As long as the score is settled.

6175
06:33:01,190 --> 06:33:02,990
That's all I care about.

6176
06:33:13,170 --> 06:33:13,730
Sad.

6177
06:33:22,880 --> 06:33:24,600
Oh, the other side is another camera.

6178
06:33:25,000 --> 06:33:28,420
Thank goodness, I thought it was a person.

6179
06:33:28,420 --> 06:33:32,180
Bandana underwear was your reward for going through Nikita hell.

6180
06:33:32,440 --> 06:33:35,960
I feel so rewarded.

6181
06:33:36,160 --> 06:33:37,100
Thank you all.

6182
06:33:37,760 --> 06:33:39,080
Thank you all.

6183
06:33:40,740 --> 06:33:42,620
What is this supposed to mean?

6184
06:34:01,200 --> 06:34:03,960
Good thing the cameras suck.

6185
06:34:05,420 --> 06:34:06,720
It says C4?

6186
06:34:06,720 --> 06:34:09,660
I don't think that is literal, right?

6187
06:34:19,180 --> 06:34:20,540
Where is it?

6188
06:34:20,540 --> 06:34:21,340
There it is.

6189
06:34:22,500 --> 06:34:24,200
Okay, nice.

6190
06:34:26,120 --> 06:34:29,780
I feel like I've made all progress and no progress.

6191
06:34:34,300 --> 06:34:36,400
Oh, the fury.

6192
06:34:38,580 --> 06:34:40,040
A flamethrower.

6193
06:34:40,040 --> 06:34:42,420
Okay, number 3 buddy.

6194
06:34:42,640 --> 06:34:43,840
Oh my god.

6195
06:34:44,680 --> 06:34:47,500
Wow, that is just Vulcan Raven.

6196
06:35:10,040 --> 06:35:12,260
This is your... sorry.

6197
06:35:13,540 --> 06:35:17,420
This is our last day in your shadow.

6198
06:35:18,920 --> 06:35:19,400
Shadow?

6199
06:35:20,700 --> 06:35:24,920
Yes, but you wouldn't know, would you?

6200
06:35:26,640 --> 06:35:30,460
How much blood was shed to purchase your glory?

6201
06:35:32,220 --> 06:35:34,240
Snake, you're no legend.

6202
06:35:34,640 --> 06:35:35,660
You're a sinner.

6203
06:35:36,700 --> 06:35:37,700
Oh my god.

6204
06:35:38,700 --> 06:35:40,200
I think Snake knows that.

6205
06:35:40,260 --> 06:35:42,320
Snake denies the legend allegations.

6206
06:35:42,480 --> 06:35:43,640
He's like, I'm no legend.

6207
06:35:45,600 --> 06:35:48,760
And you will make your reparations now.

6208
06:35:50,300 --> 06:35:53,820
The price for your sins is your life.

6209
06:35:57,460 --> 06:35:59,860
Every human being burns differently.

6210
06:36:01,060 --> 06:36:02,940
Did you know that?

6211
06:36:04,900 --> 06:36:07,600
The way the skin scorches.

6212
06:36:07,760 --> 06:36:10,600
Okay, when he does his death speech, I'm not keeping this up.

6213
06:36:10,660 --> 06:36:12,240
I'm just letting you guys know now.

6214
06:36:13,060 --> 06:36:19,440
The way the skin scorches, the fat burns, the innards char.

6215
06:36:21,860 --> 06:36:23,680
Changes from person to person.

6216
06:36:24,760 --> 06:36:29,600
And you see there the burdens of their sin.

6217
06:36:31,420 --> 06:36:32,780
He's still going.

6218
06:36:32,980 --> 06:36:35,420
Save it for when you're on your deathbed please.

6219
06:36:35,920 --> 06:36:37,840
I wonder how you'll burn.

6220
06:36:39,380 --> 06:36:41,040
I'll know soon enough.

6221
06:36:41,880 --> 06:36:42,420
Yeehaw!

6222
06:36:42,540 --> 06:36:43,240
Oh, burn!

6223
06:36:46,860 --> 06:36:47,580
Alright.

6224
06:36:53,140 --> 06:36:55,940
Maybe a machine gun and body armor.

6225
06:37:04,560 --> 06:37:07,440
Wait, I shot you, but... I should probably...

6226
06:37:08,720 --> 06:37:10,860
Oh my god, the music is so messy.

6227
06:37:12,940 --> 06:37:14,520
I'm gonna use this just in case.

6228
06:37:14,940 --> 06:37:16,040
And body armor, there we go.

6229
06:37:23,730 --> 06:37:25,590
So I just gotta stay away from him.

6230
06:37:26,150 --> 06:37:27,450
It's not so bad, I think.

6231
06:37:28,330 --> 06:37:29,570
And I... Oh, ouchie ouchie.

6232
06:37:29,710 --> 06:37:31,570
And then I bait him, and I'm on fire.

6233
06:37:31,810 --> 06:37:33,410
And then I shoot him, and I miss.

6234
06:37:34,010 --> 06:37:35,470
And I shoot him, and I miss.

6235
06:37:36,650 --> 06:37:39,310
And I shoot him, and I miss.

6236
06:37:39,310 --> 06:37:40,590
Or did I get him?

6237
06:37:42,590 --> 06:37:43,410
Did I get him?

6238
06:37:43,750 --> 06:37:44,090
I think?

6239
06:37:44,270 --> 06:37:44,750
Did I hit him?

6240
06:37:51,170 --> 06:37:54,950
Is he... Is he burning up my...

6241
06:37:57,650 --> 06:37:58,890
Is he burning up my bullets?

6242
06:37:59,250 --> 06:37:59,450
Ouch.

6243
06:38:03,630 --> 06:38:05,490
Oh, he's... How did I take damage?

6244
06:38:05,530 --> 06:38:06,850
How did he take damage the first time?

6245
06:38:07,190 --> 06:38:07,470
What?

6246
06:38:07,690 --> 06:38:08,470
I'm so confused.

6247
06:38:08,810 --> 06:38:09,830
Maybe only behind him.

6248
06:38:10,650 --> 06:38:11,910
I don't think so.

6249
06:38:13,910 --> 06:38:16,190
Oh, he takes damage sometimes.

6250
06:38:16,710 --> 06:38:19,250
I don't... I don't understand.

6251
06:38:20,990 --> 06:38:21,670
Huh?

6252
06:38:33,070 --> 06:38:34,950
Oh, it's recommending grenades.

6253
06:38:47,320 --> 06:38:48,100
Ouchie ouch.

6254
06:38:49,660 --> 06:38:50,400
Oh my god.

6255
06:38:52,040 --> 06:38:57,940
I think when I shot him from behind, he was facing the other, you know, like...

6256
06:38:57,940 --> 06:38:58,080
Oh.

6257
06:38:58,360 --> 06:38:59,380
Oh, got him, got him, got him.

6258
06:39:00,020 --> 06:39:00,380
You know?

6259
06:39:03,640 --> 06:39:05,180
I'm gonna switch to grenades.

6260
06:39:05,620 --> 06:39:06,460
Let's try that instead.

6261
06:39:15,550 --> 06:39:16,030
Damage!

6262
06:39:16,110 --> 06:39:16,710
Oh, just kidding.

6263
06:39:17,350 --> 06:39:17,690
Ration!

6264
06:39:24,730 --> 06:39:25,870
There we go.

6265
06:39:26,210 --> 06:39:27,090
Grenades do good.

6266
06:39:28,830 --> 06:39:29,290
Where'd he go?

6267
06:39:32,030 --> 06:39:32,510
Oh.

6268
06:39:33,310 --> 06:39:33,790
Yikes.

6269
06:39:39,820 --> 06:39:40,900
Oh, now he's running.

6270
06:39:43,780 --> 06:39:45,840
Oh, I thought I still got him though.

6271
06:39:46,620 --> 06:39:47,160
Got me.

6272
06:40:00,860 --> 06:40:02,420
Thank goodness for body armor, huh?

6273
06:40:07,110 --> 06:40:08,490
Oh my god, he's running.

6274
06:40:08,590 --> 06:40:09,570
He is running, guys.

6275
06:40:10,050 --> 06:40:10,850
He's running man.

6276
06:40:11,250 --> 06:40:11,850
Running man.

6277
06:40:14,510 --> 06:40:16,230
Maybe like one, two more?

6278
06:40:17,550 --> 06:40:18,250
Come here!

6279
06:40:20,790 --> 06:40:21,650
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

6280
06:40:24,370 --> 06:40:26,550
One more, one more, one more, one more.

6281
06:40:29,180 --> 06:40:29,800
Oh, shoot.

6282
06:40:30,140 --> 06:40:30,820
Ouch, ouch.

6283
06:40:34,260 --> 06:40:35,240
Oh my goodness.

6284
06:40:35,380 --> 06:40:35,760
OK, fine.

6285
06:40:37,420 --> 06:40:38,100
Got him.

6286
06:40:43,490 --> 06:40:44,010
Terrible!

6287
06:40:44,990 --> 06:40:48,850
You cleared the stage, but you were the worst.

6288
06:40:50,150 --> 06:40:51,230
Ars, welcome to membership.

6289
06:40:51,410 --> 06:40:51,970
Thank you!

6290
06:40:53,570 --> 06:40:54,950
OK, here it comes.

6291
06:41:00,870 --> 06:41:01,350
Snake.

6292
06:41:05,510 --> 06:41:09,450
I know that I'm a sinner without you having to tell me.

6293
06:41:10,970 --> 06:41:12,330
But why, Shadow?

6294
06:41:14,610 --> 06:41:15,090
Alright.

6295
06:41:16,070 --> 06:41:17,630
Oh my god, his voice went up so much.

6296
06:41:19,630 --> 06:41:21,730
You'll learn what your sins really are.

6297
06:41:22,310 --> 06:41:26,050
I didn't actually realize... I didn't see how long it took me last...

6298
06:41:29,230 --> 06:41:30,110
Last stage.

6299
06:41:30,170 --> 06:41:30,990
It was a long time.

6300
06:41:32,690 --> 06:41:33,010
Hold on.

6301
06:41:33,250 --> 06:41:36,010
You guys listen to this killer song and I'm gonna go get some water.

6302
06:41:37,810 --> 06:41:39,070
It's kind of creepy, actually.

6303
06:41:41,030 --> 06:41:43,230
Last stage... This is 48 minutes?

6304
06:41:43,430 --> 06:41:44,490
Oh my god.

6305
06:41:45,870 --> 06:41:47,370
Here, I'm gonna go get some water real quick.

6306
06:41:47,630 --> 06:41:47,930
Sorry.

6307
06:43:26,280 --> 06:43:27,540
I got pizza!

6308
06:43:27,700 --> 06:43:27,980
Awesome!

6309
06:43:27,980 --> 06:43:28,100
Pizza!

6310
06:43:29,080 --> 06:43:29,640
Yay!

6311
06:43:31,040 --> 06:43:32,540
Leftover pizza from yesterday.

6312
06:43:32,720 --> 06:43:34,320
I was gonna heat it up and then I was like...

6313
06:43:34,320 --> 06:43:36,100
I said I was only gonna get water.

6314
06:43:37,240 --> 06:43:38,060
I'm taking too long.

6315
06:43:46,310 --> 06:43:47,290
What kind of pizza?

6316
06:43:47,430 --> 06:43:48,150
Just cheese.

6317
06:43:49,150 --> 06:43:50,250
Nothing special.

6318
06:43:54,040 --> 06:43:56,280
The black chamber...

6319
06:43:57,240 --> 06:44:00,220
Was born in the shadow of Foxhound.

6320
06:44:00,960 --> 06:44:02,280
Yeah, I have no...

6321
06:44:03,360 --> 06:44:04,160
No poop.

6322
06:44:07,940 --> 06:44:10,160
Seven years ago...

6323
06:44:10,160 --> 06:44:12,980
You destroyed Metal Gear here...

6324
06:44:12,980 --> 06:44:14,000
In Outer Heaven.

6325
06:44:14,900 --> 06:44:17,780
And put Foxhound in the headlines.

6326
06:44:19,140 --> 06:44:22,340
Everyone in the world knew the name...

6327
06:44:22,340 --> 06:44:23,780
Solid Snake.

6328
06:44:24,100 --> 06:44:25,760
Which seems kind of insane to me.

6329
06:44:26,040 --> 06:44:29,580
That, like, they didn't keep it under super wraps, you know?

6330
06:44:32,440 --> 06:44:35,940
But, you know, you have Nastasha just publishing a whole book about...

6331
06:44:37,180 --> 06:44:39,040
About Shadow Moses, so...

6332
06:44:41,060 --> 06:44:42,340
I guess it's whatever.

6333
06:44:47,570 --> 06:44:48,570
I think they tried.

6334
06:44:51,490 --> 06:44:53,850
Famous espionage agent should be an oxymoron.

6335
06:44:53,910 --> 06:44:54,630
I know, right?

6336
06:44:55,330 --> 06:44:55,850
Like...

6337
06:44:55,850 --> 06:44:57,590
It's a little bizarre.

6338
06:45:05,050 --> 06:45:06,350
That's what I leaked at first.

6339
06:45:06,350 --> 06:45:07,190
That guy.

6340
06:45:09,970 --> 06:45:11,650
It's bedtime, Oyasumi.

6341
06:45:12,170 --> 06:45:14,690
Oyasumi, thanks for staying around for so long.

6342
06:45:20,550 --> 06:45:22,090
And so you became the legend.

6343
06:45:25,570 --> 06:45:27,970
But Foxhound got too famous.

6344
06:45:28,510 --> 06:45:30,610
Since Outer Heaven.

6345
06:45:30,810 --> 06:45:34,830
It's every move was watched by intelligence organizations.

6346
06:45:36,310 --> 06:45:37,110
Everywhere.

6347
06:45:38,130 --> 06:45:42,090
Truly covert operations became impossible.

6348
06:45:43,310 --> 06:45:44,870
So Black Chamber was created.

6349
06:45:45,810 --> 06:45:49,250
We took over every covert ops that had.

6350
06:45:50,270 --> 06:45:51,110
Been Foxhounds...

6351
06:45:52,470 --> 06:45:53,450
Foxhounds.

6352
06:45:53,610 --> 06:45:57,090
Assassination of anti-American foreign leaders.

6353
06:45:57,910 --> 06:46:00,390
Removal of domestic civilians.

6354
06:46:00,930 --> 06:46:04,250
Engaged in anti-establishment activities.

6355
06:46:04,490 --> 06:46:05,270
These are big words.

6356
06:46:05,270 --> 06:46:11,170
Intervention in strife and civil wars that affect American interests.

6357
06:46:12,350 --> 06:46:13,070
Skywriter.

6358
06:46:14,010 --> 06:46:15,730
Thank you for the two months.

6359
06:46:17,910 --> 06:46:20,410
Doing the dirty work in the dark.

6360
06:46:20,810 --> 06:46:24,330
On and on in the shadow of the great legend.

6361
06:46:25,390 --> 06:46:28,270
I mean, then don't...

6362
06:46:28,790 --> 06:46:30,210
I don't know what to tell you, man.

6363
06:46:30,330 --> 06:46:33,090
You joined the organization, right?

6364
06:46:33,090 --> 06:46:34,870
Like, how did you get in?

6365
06:46:35,490 --> 06:46:37,830
If they asked you to join, just say no.

6366
06:46:38,750 --> 06:46:40,330
What do you want me to...

6367
06:46:40,330 --> 06:46:43,190
And you are going to blame him for your shortcomings?

6368
06:46:43,630 --> 06:46:44,050
Okay.

6369
06:46:46,250 --> 06:46:48,150
I never wanted to be called a legend.

6370
06:46:53,470 --> 06:46:54,070
Liar.

6371
06:46:54,570 --> 06:46:58,410
Ask yourself why you volunteered for difficult missions.

6372
06:46:59,110 --> 06:47:00,770
Why you are here right now.

6373
06:47:06,470 --> 06:47:07,550
Is that real?

6374
06:47:08,730 --> 06:47:11,370
You've killed 17 people here already.

6375
06:47:11,510 --> 06:47:13,490
Is that...

6376
06:47:16,010 --> 06:47:17,610
My actual death count?

6377
06:47:19,330 --> 06:47:21,950
Okay, but 17 in 7 hours?

6378
06:47:22,030 --> 06:47:22,850
Ain't so bad.

6379
06:47:23,210 --> 06:47:26,110
Oh my god, it's already been 7 hours of streaming.

6380
06:47:26,470 --> 06:47:27,250
You guys.

6381
06:47:30,110 --> 06:47:32,790
I'm going to take it easy a little bit next week on the...

6382
06:47:34,830 --> 06:47:36,930
Of course you want to be a legend.

6383
06:47:36,930 --> 06:47:40,870
Deep inside, you want the glory.

6384
06:47:41,630 --> 06:47:43,950
And you keep killing for it.

6385
06:47:44,750 --> 06:47:48,510
Because it's the only thing you're good at.

6386
06:47:49,750 --> 06:47:52,330
Everybody always tells him what he already thinks.

6387
06:47:52,410 --> 06:47:53,070
It's so sad.

6388
06:47:59,120 --> 06:48:01,640
I've got more good news for you.

6389
06:48:02,140 --> 06:48:03,660
My pathetic friend.

6390
06:48:06,240 --> 06:48:09,040
There's one of us among your trusted rank.

6391
06:48:09,040 --> 06:48:11,120
Ah, we knew it.

6392
06:48:12,180 --> 06:48:13,160
Thank you, Minto.

6393
06:48:13,540 --> 06:48:14,060
For what?

6394
06:48:14,140 --> 06:48:14,780
What did I do?

6395
06:48:16,240 --> 06:48:16,560
What?

6396
06:48:18,680 --> 06:48:21,100
Didn't you think it was strange?

6397
06:48:21,700 --> 06:48:24,400
That we knew about you coming?

6398
06:48:25,540 --> 06:48:30,520
That we were waiting for you every step of the way?

6399
06:48:33,180 --> 06:48:33,940
But...

6400
06:48:34,700 --> 06:48:37,920
When you were talking to each other...

6401
06:48:37,920 --> 06:48:40,760
You were talking to us.

6402
06:48:41,500 --> 06:48:42,660
So who is it?

6403
06:48:42,780 --> 06:48:44,300
I still think it's McBride.

6404
06:48:44,360 --> 06:48:45,480
It's McBride all the way.

6405
06:48:45,780 --> 06:48:46,760
But that's not possible.

6406
06:48:47,680 --> 06:48:50,520
We literally tickled this idea earlier, Snake.

6407
06:48:51,260 --> 06:48:52,280
Is that M.

6408
06:48:52,320 --> 06:48:53,420
Bison from Street Fighter?

6409
06:48:55,020 --> 06:48:55,820
Yes, Snake.

6410
06:48:56,260 --> 06:48:56,740
Suspect.

6411
06:48:59,340 --> 06:49:00,540
Suspect everything.

6412
06:49:00,840 --> 06:49:01,240
Everyone.

6413
06:49:01,900 --> 06:49:03,980
And die without knowing.

6414
06:49:03,980 --> 06:49:05,380
That sucks.

6415
06:49:06,140 --> 06:49:07,500
Your doubts and suffering.

6416
06:49:07,920 --> 06:49:08,540
Your hatred.

6417
06:49:08,960 --> 06:49:11,180
That would turn Snake into a ghost actually.

6418
06:49:11,740 --> 06:49:12,100
Probably.

6419
06:49:12,760 --> 06:49:17,040
Because he would die with unfinished business.

6420
06:49:17,500 --> 06:49:18,980
And then...

6421
06:49:21,800 --> 06:49:23,240
And I'm a ghost, you know?

6422
06:49:29,120 --> 06:49:31,920
Best tribute to my fallen comrades.

6423
06:49:31,920 --> 06:49:35,140
Two years since the trap closed.

6424
06:49:36,520 --> 06:49:37,720
Only five of us left.

6425
06:49:38,340 --> 06:49:42,600
The rest of Black Chamber dead at traitor's hands.

6426
06:49:43,940 --> 06:49:44,640
Five?

6427
06:49:45,980 --> 06:49:48,400
Oh, the one guy that's in our party?

6428
06:49:50,960 --> 06:49:52,100
This is planned payback.

6429
06:49:53,280 --> 06:49:54,100
To Foxtown.

6430
06:49:54,420 --> 06:49:54,840
To you.

6431
06:49:55,600 --> 06:49:56,760
And to Anonymous.

6432
06:49:56,760 --> 06:49:57,920
What the hell?

6433
06:50:00,320 --> 06:50:03,180
Did they watch that Guy Fawkes movie?

6434
06:50:04,100 --> 06:50:04,760
What's it called?

6435
06:50:05,540 --> 06:50:06,680
V for Vendetta?

6436
06:50:14,480 --> 06:50:17,520
Guilf are just pawns in our greatest game.

6437
06:50:21,550 --> 06:50:23,570
Viper will take care of the rest.

6438
06:50:23,970 --> 06:50:25,390
I can die in peace.

6439
06:50:26,030 --> 06:50:28,070
But I don't need your help.

6440
06:50:28,610 --> 06:50:29,970
I'm not going to help you die.

6441
06:50:29,970 --> 06:50:31,310
Do it on your own.

6442
06:50:33,210 --> 06:50:33,850
Fire.

6443
06:50:34,410 --> 06:50:35,310
Gentle fire.

6444
06:50:36,050 --> 06:50:38,610
It cleanses all things alike.

6445
06:50:41,290 --> 06:50:43,390
It is the great equalizer.

6446
06:50:46,520 --> 06:50:48,600
I've never seen that movie before.

6447
06:50:48,940 --> 06:50:50,140
The V for Vendetta.

6448
06:50:53,520 --> 06:50:55,060
But isn't it basically that?

6449
06:50:58,500 --> 06:50:59,620
It's pretty good.

6450
06:50:59,900 --> 06:51:00,480
Read the graphic.

6451
06:51:00,600 --> 06:51:01,700
Oh, there's a graphic novel.

6452
06:51:03,940 --> 06:51:04,960
It's pretty good.

6453
06:51:07,320 --> 06:51:09,120
You'll be fine never seeing it.

6454
06:51:09,680 --> 06:51:10,760
I like watching movies.

6455
06:51:12,280 --> 06:51:14,520
Of both the sinful and the innocent.

6456
06:51:16,500 --> 06:51:18,200
That's where I'll die.

6457
06:51:18,480 --> 06:51:19,140
On fire?

6458
06:51:19,640 --> 06:51:21,320
In the heart of the fire.

6459
06:51:21,440 --> 06:51:23,000
I thought he was going to say the heart of the flame.

6460
06:51:26,210 --> 06:51:27,330
Oh my god!

6461
06:51:28,310 --> 06:51:30,050
He was talking so much.

6462
06:51:30,110 --> 06:51:32,710
I feel like if I just left him he would've been fine.

6463
06:51:32,710 --> 06:51:35,150
But he chose this.

6464
06:51:35,490 --> 06:51:37,230
The heat.

6465
06:51:37,670 --> 06:51:39,630
This is what I've been looking for.

6466
06:51:40,530 --> 06:51:41,390
I'm burning!

6467
06:51:44,630 --> 06:51:46,010
Oh god, yes!

6468
06:51:46,990 --> 06:51:50,140
Oh yes!

6469
06:51:50,680 --> 06:51:51,460
The fire!

6470
06:51:52,480 --> 06:51:53,300
Yes!

6471
06:52:01,720 --> 06:52:03,490
That was weird.

6472
06:52:04,030 --> 06:52:05,190
I heard Snake.

6473
06:52:07,050 --> 06:52:09,310
Don't let the enemy get to you.

6474
06:52:14,680 --> 06:52:19,500
There is no way a spy could be among us.

6475
06:52:20,020 --> 06:52:20,460
I

6476
06:52:28,830 --> 06:52:31,070
was supposed to say the brain rot.

6477
06:52:31,550 --> 06:52:33,710
You're not supposed to speak it aloud.

6478
06:52:36,270 --> 06:52:37,110
Wanna bet?

6479
06:52:37,630 --> 06:52:40,670
I think it's McBurger, whatever his name is.

6480
06:52:41,710 --> 06:52:42,810
What did you say?

6481
06:52:43,410 --> 06:52:47,510
There are too many weird things about...

6482
06:52:47,510 --> 06:52:48,850
this mission.

6483
06:52:50,890 --> 06:52:52,310
Including this committee.

6484
06:52:54,070 --> 06:52:54,790
Oh McBride.

6485
06:52:55,730 --> 06:52:57,810
What the hell are you saying?

6486
06:52:58,590 --> 06:52:59,550
McBurger.

6487
06:53:02,370 --> 06:53:03,970
Take you for example.

6488
06:53:04,750 --> 06:53:08,550
Why is the CIA putting into an army operation?

6489
06:53:09,470 --> 06:53:12,770
And you're a little too full of advice, eh?

6490
06:53:15,110 --> 06:53:17,970
Weasel, stop this.

6491
06:53:18,370 --> 06:53:20,330
You too, Campbell.

6492
06:53:21,190 --> 06:53:22,530
Aren't you retired?

6493
06:53:23,690 --> 06:53:26,070
What the hell are you doing here?

6494
06:53:29,170 --> 06:53:31,010
That's because...

6495
06:53:31,010 --> 06:53:35,090
And you know something about Black Chamber.

6496
06:53:35,810 --> 06:53:38,510
That you are not telling us.

6497
06:53:38,830 --> 06:53:39,370
Uh-oh.

6498
06:53:41,030 --> 06:53:42,850
I need scissor 61.

6499
06:53:43,130 --> 06:53:43,770
Doesn't...

6500
06:53:43,770 --> 06:53:45,750
In the...

6501
06:53:45,750 --> 06:53:48,590
When Colonel goes crazy in MGS2, doesn't he...

6502
06:53:48,590 --> 06:53:49,910
He talks about Gallowade.

6503
06:53:50,270 --> 06:53:52,630
He's like, infiltrate the fortress Gallowade.

6504
06:53:55,790 --> 06:53:58,050
Yeah, that's why I recognize the name.

6505
06:54:02,070 --> 06:54:03,130
That's so fun.

6506
06:54:04,510 --> 06:54:05,710
Am I right?

6507
06:54:08,920 --> 06:54:11,320
Cat got your tongue.

6508
06:54:11,920 --> 06:54:15,480
He does, yeah.

6509
06:54:17,600 --> 06:54:19,820
Right to remain silent.

6510
06:54:20,820 --> 06:54:23,200
Weasel Loki sounds like my friend.

6511
06:54:25,280 --> 06:54:26,040
Stop it.

6512
06:54:27,420 --> 06:54:28,440
Hey, sweetheart.

6513
06:54:29,140 --> 06:54:30,380
You're no exception.

6514
06:54:30,380 --> 06:54:33,320
Hey, you can...

6515
06:54:33,320 --> 06:54:37,460
You can not trust anybody in this entire operation.

6516
06:54:38,020 --> 06:54:39,420
Don't touch her, Weasel.

6517
06:54:40,140 --> 06:54:43,280
I don't care what kind of hot shot techie you are.

6518
06:54:44,680 --> 06:54:47,260
A grad student on a classified mission?

6519
06:54:48,860 --> 06:54:50,040
That's weird.

6520
06:54:53,120 --> 06:54:53,800
You...

6521
06:54:54,380 --> 06:54:55,540
You, Weasel.

6522
06:55:00,380 --> 06:55:01,280
What do you mean?

6523
06:55:02,400 --> 06:55:04,820
I don't care if Mei Ling is betraying us, honestly.

6524
06:55:05,400 --> 06:55:06,900
But she wouldn't ever do that anyway.

6525
06:55:07,340 --> 06:55:08,840
You think I don't know?

6526
06:55:09,380 --> 06:55:12,600
Five years ago in that war...

6527
06:55:12,600 --> 06:55:15,380
Your own brother and...

6528
06:55:17,260 --> 06:55:18,360
What's it to you?

6529
06:55:20,320 --> 06:55:24,160
I'm just saying that you can't be trusted.

6530
06:55:25,300 --> 06:55:25,880
Brother?

6531
06:55:25,880 --> 06:55:26,840
Good.

6532
06:55:27,300 --> 06:55:29,740
It's no compliment to have your trust.

6533
06:55:31,680 --> 06:55:33,000
Weasel is such a little...

6534
06:55:33,460 --> 06:55:34,580
Oh, he's such a weasel.

6535
06:55:34,920 --> 06:55:35,940
It's a perfect name for him.

6536
06:55:36,700 --> 06:55:37,240
Enough of this.

6537
06:55:38,460 --> 06:55:39,620
There is no spy.

6538
06:55:39,760 --> 06:55:40,800
Okay, when you...

6539
06:55:40,800 --> 06:55:43,120
Campbell, the fact that you're not even like...

6540
06:55:43,120 --> 06:55:46,200
Entertaining the idea makes you way more subtle.

6541
06:55:47,560 --> 06:55:51,980
This is an enemy tactic to confuse and divide us.

6542
06:55:51,980 --> 06:55:56,060
Snake, just think about preventing that...

6543
06:55:57,580 --> 06:55:59,020
Nuclear strike.

6544
06:56:00,480 --> 06:56:01,800
Take out the power plant.

6545
06:56:02,500 --> 06:56:05,220
Snake, you have to trust me.

6546
06:56:05,300 --> 06:56:06,440
Don't say that.

6547
06:56:07,360 --> 06:56:08,260
I'd like to.

6548
06:56:09,500 --> 06:56:10,700
When heavens divide.

6549
06:56:15,640 --> 06:56:16,640
Who's calling?

6550
06:56:16,780 --> 06:56:17,020
Chris?

6551
06:56:17,260 --> 06:56:17,580
Campbell.

6552
06:56:18,340 --> 06:56:20,600
Destroy the plant's main turbine.

6553
06:56:21,340 --> 06:56:23,600
It should be on the floor B1.

6554
06:56:23,820 --> 06:56:24,260
Hurry.

6555
06:56:28,280 --> 06:56:30,040
Feels so good, baby.

6556
06:56:31,380 --> 06:56:33,700
Feels good to be good.

6557
06:56:35,600 --> 06:56:37,700
I want to get out of the power plant so bad.

6558
06:56:37,860 --> 06:56:41,060
Okay, I remember someone saying that I would need a guide for the power plant.

6559
06:56:42,380 --> 06:56:43,340
And I...

6560
06:56:45,320 --> 06:56:47,200
I understand why you would say that.

6561
06:56:57,960 --> 06:56:59,460
How many more missions do I have?

6562
06:56:59,560 --> 06:56:59,820
Let's see.

6563
06:57:05,500 --> 06:57:07,960
One, two, three, four?

6564
06:57:08,500 --> 06:57:08,980
Four more?

6565
06:57:10,280 --> 06:57:10,680
Five?

6566
06:57:11,340 --> 06:57:11,940
I can't tell.

6567
06:57:16,100 --> 06:57:16,500
Alright.

6568
06:57:17,320 --> 06:57:21,240
Call the elevator, go to the basement, go to the air duct to skip the poisonous room.

6569
06:57:22,080 --> 06:57:22,840
Thanks, guide.

6570
06:57:25,260 --> 06:57:29,000
Thank you, guide, for telling me about the poisonous room that I would have...

6571
06:57:29,000 --> 06:57:31,180
would have gone into otherwise.

6572
06:57:32,560 --> 06:57:34,000
A bunch of them are fights.

6573
06:57:34,000 --> 06:57:34,260
Okay.

6574
06:57:37,160 --> 06:57:39,420
This is honestly...

6575
06:57:39,420 --> 06:57:42,540
so much for a Game Boy game.

6576
06:57:43,040 --> 06:57:45,300
This is...

6577
06:57:45,300 --> 06:57:47,000
so much...

6578
06:57:47,920 --> 06:57:49,020
for a Game Boy game.

6579
06:57:49,400 --> 06:57:51,340
Like, holy...

6580
06:57:51,340 --> 06:57:51,960
What?

6581
06:57:53,420 --> 06:57:55,020
It's insane.

6582
06:57:56,760 --> 06:57:59,020
Like, sure, these levels get a little...

6583
06:58:00,240 --> 06:58:01,440
like, you know, annoying.

6584
06:58:01,780 --> 06:58:04,240
The bosses haven't been so bad so far.

6585
06:58:04,600 --> 06:58:06,240
Wait, let me make sure I'm in the right spot.

6586
06:58:12,000 --> 06:58:13,400
Kill the guard and go east.

6587
06:58:13,580 --> 06:58:14,620
Did I go the right one?

6588
06:58:16,780 --> 06:58:19,080
Did I go in the right air duct exit?

6589
06:58:19,760 --> 06:58:20,740
What guard is there?

6590
06:58:20,840 --> 06:58:21,480
Why do you think...

6591
06:58:21,480 --> 06:58:23,580
Why is the guide telling me to kill?

6592
06:58:24,060 --> 06:58:24,320
Huh?

6593
06:58:24,440 --> 06:58:25,580
You want more death...

6594
06:58:25,580 --> 06:58:27,520
more murders under my belt?

6595
06:58:27,520 --> 06:58:28,560
What's in here?

6596
06:58:28,800 --> 06:58:29,480
Oh, this is... okay.

6597
06:58:48,030 --> 06:58:48,470
Snake.

6598
06:58:48,790 --> 06:58:49,790
How is it going?

6599
06:58:49,870 --> 06:58:50,710
I just got here.

6600
06:58:50,830 --> 06:58:51,190
Chill.

6601
06:58:54,920 --> 06:58:57,040
The perimeter of the main turbine is...

6602
06:58:57,660 --> 06:59:00,100
secured with electrified flooring.

6603
06:59:02,780 --> 06:59:04,240
It didn't need to go this hard.

6604
06:59:04,360 --> 06:59:05,100
Kojumbo did it again.

6605
06:59:05,180 --> 06:59:07,720
I don't think Kojima actually had anything to do with this game though.

6606
06:59:10,880 --> 06:59:11,880
Correct me if I'm wrong.

6607
06:59:12,300 --> 06:59:13,660
I can't get close to it.

6608
06:59:15,890 --> 06:59:16,260
Damn.

6609
06:59:16,600 --> 06:59:19,080
We have no choice but to take out...

6610
06:59:19,080 --> 06:59:20,580
the plant itself.

6611
06:59:21,020 --> 06:59:23,440
What about the Nikita missiles I just acquired?

6612
06:59:25,280 --> 06:59:27,480
What about the missiles?

6613
06:59:29,810 --> 06:59:32,240
The missiles that I can control.

6614
06:59:32,660 --> 06:59:35,040
The missiles that I've been using to cross...

6615
06:59:35,740 --> 06:59:37,960
the electrified flooring this entire time.

6616
06:59:43,040 --> 06:59:43,780
Snake.

6617
06:59:44,080 --> 06:59:45,960
Take the power plant out.

6618
06:59:46,700 --> 06:59:49,960
Set C4 explosives on four key points...

6619
06:59:50,480 --> 06:59:52,380
to destroy the structure.

6620
06:59:54,660 --> 06:59:58,420
You should see four columns clustered around...

6621
06:59:58,420 --> 06:59:59,520
the main turbine.

6622
07:00:00,620 --> 07:00:04,920
There are a total of four points on the columns...

6623
07:00:04,920 --> 07:00:07,280
where the corners are missing.

6624
07:00:08,580 --> 07:00:09,580
How do you know this?

6625
07:00:12,860 --> 07:00:14,280
How do you know this?

6626
07:00:17,420 --> 07:00:18,480
This is like...

6627
07:00:19,900 --> 07:00:23,060
This is the most sus thing you've said this far.

6628
07:00:23,660 --> 07:00:24,840
I... What?

6629
07:00:25,780 --> 07:00:30,420
They are the weak point in the plant's structural integrity.

6630
07:00:30,960 --> 07:00:35,420
If you blow up all of them with C4 explosives...

6631
07:00:36,440 --> 07:00:38,480
the plant should be destroyed.

6632
07:00:41,180 --> 07:00:44,500
I love if it's actually Colonel that's the bad guy.

6633
07:00:44,660 --> 07:00:45,760
Like the... What's it called?

6634
07:00:45,760 --> 07:00:49,240
The spy among us.

6635
07:00:50,640 --> 07:00:51,240
And...

6636
07:00:51,760 --> 07:00:55,460
You know, some kid played this and then played too and was like...

6637
07:00:55,460 --> 07:00:56,560
Hey, wait a second.

6638
07:00:57,420 --> 07:00:59,720
Why'd they do the same twist twice?

6639
07:01:01,480 --> 07:01:03,240
That would be messed up.

6640
07:01:03,860 --> 07:01:07,460
I would actually probably be kind of angry about that.

6641
07:01:08,360 --> 07:01:10,720
Fool me once, shame on me.

6642
07:01:10,900 --> 07:01:13,400
Fool me twice, shame on you.

6643
07:01:14,360 --> 07:01:17,660
Don't waste any C4 on innocent locations.

6644
07:01:18,500 --> 07:01:21,600
There are only so many that can be set.

6645
07:01:22,940 --> 07:01:23,320
Alright.

6646
07:01:24,880 --> 07:01:25,440
So four.

6647
07:01:26,340 --> 07:01:31,580
There are a total of four points on the columns around the main turbine.

6648
07:01:32,440 --> 07:01:34,960
Where the corners are missing.

6649
07:01:36,160 --> 07:01:38,600
Plant a C4 on every single one.

6650
07:01:39,620 --> 07:01:40,180
Okay.

6651
07:01:43,360 --> 07:01:45,160
Columns around the turbine.

6652
07:01:47,580 --> 07:01:48,580
Is this...

6653
07:01:48,580 --> 07:01:49,580
Is this C4?

6654
07:01:50,280 --> 07:01:51,020
Good, nice.

6655
07:01:54,400 --> 07:01:56,000
How do I get around it though?

6656
07:01:57,820 --> 07:01:59,680
Thanks for the info, dumb Colonel.

6657
07:02:00,360 --> 07:02:01,880
Is this a...

6658
07:02:01,880 --> 07:02:02,540
I'm

6659
07:02:06,790 --> 07:02:09,130
kind of confused by this, but give me a second.

6660
07:02:15,410 --> 07:02:16,870
Is this a...

6661
07:02:16,870 --> 07:02:18,830
Is this a...

6662
07:02:18,830 --> 07:02:19,850
One of them?

6663
07:02:20,450 --> 07:02:21,530
Like one of the...

6664
07:02:21,530 --> 07:02:24,390
This just looks like storage, it doesn't look like a column.

6665
07:02:25,250 --> 07:02:27,390
And then something where the corner is missing.

6666
07:02:27,730 --> 07:02:27,970
Huh?

6667
07:02:28,690 --> 07:02:30,470
Okay, hold on, let me go to the other side.

6668
07:02:32,690 --> 07:02:33,730
This way.

6669
07:02:46,060 --> 07:02:47,320
They look distinct.

6670
07:02:48,120 --> 07:02:49,740
They change location every playthrough.

6671
07:02:50,340 --> 07:02:50,860
What?

6672
07:02:52,000 --> 07:02:53,680
Probably be really obvious, okay.

6673
07:02:53,680 --> 07:02:56,040
Let's go check out the other side.

6674
07:02:59,200 --> 07:03:03,380
If the story is alright, I can imagine people wanting to defend it despite not being a full Kojima thing.

6675
07:03:03,540 --> 07:03:04,960
Yeah, I know, the story is great.

6676
07:03:06,820 --> 07:03:07,700
Oh, nevermind.

6677
07:03:08,020 --> 07:03:08,780
Wait, what?

6678
07:03:09,500 --> 07:03:11,080
Where the hell am I supposed to go?

6679
07:03:14,320 --> 07:03:14,760
Okay.

6680
07:03:14,760 --> 07:03:15,020
Okay.

6681
07:03:23,360 --> 07:03:26,060
They change location, speedrunners might say this, right?

6682
07:03:26,240 --> 07:03:27,460
They're probably so like...

6683
07:03:28,220 --> 07:03:28,740
No!

6684
07:03:42,900 --> 07:03:46,580
And then I can't leave, so I'm just like...

6685
07:03:47,800 --> 07:03:48,320
What?

6686
07:03:49,100 --> 07:03:51,240
I have no idea what I'm supposed to be looking for.

6687
07:03:51,360 --> 07:03:52,700
Colonel, give me...

6688
07:03:52,700 --> 07:03:53,800
Give me a sign!

6689
07:04:12,230 --> 07:04:13,730
Is that a pillar?

6690
07:04:13,730 --> 07:04:14,150
Alright,

6691
07:04:27,140 --> 07:04:28,300
go back to the elevator.

6692
07:04:29,700 --> 07:04:31,080
Go back to the elevator.

6693
07:04:32,060 --> 07:04:34,620
Okay, this guide is saying where...

6694
07:04:35,220 --> 07:04:36,620
Wait, this guide is saying...

6695
07:04:37,340 --> 07:04:39,200
Go back to the room where you fought Pyro Bison.

6696
07:04:41,600 --> 07:04:44,620
But if you guys are saying it's random, then...

6697
07:04:52,300 --> 07:04:55,960
It won't let you plant C4 in incorrect places.

6698
07:04:56,120 --> 07:04:57,400
Oh, okay, that's kinda nice.

6699
07:05:00,500 --> 07:05:01,380
Okay, um...

6700
07:05:03,520 --> 07:05:05,800
One of yours was in Pyro Bison's room.

6701
07:05:05,880 --> 07:05:06,960
Oh, you saw it already!

6702
07:05:07,300 --> 07:05:08,140
I kept note of yours.

6703
07:05:08,300 --> 07:05:09,340
Oh my gosh, blue!

6704
07:05:11,100 --> 07:05:12,340
You're so smart!

6705
07:05:12,600 --> 07:05:13,340
Thank you!

6706
07:05:17,140 --> 07:05:18,420
Alright, what floor...

6707
07:05:18,420 --> 07:05:19,580
That was just one floor up, right?

6708
07:05:19,780 --> 07:05:19,980
Okay.

6709
07:05:25,120 --> 07:05:26,740
Oh wait, no, it was right here.

6710
07:05:27,800 --> 07:05:28,620
No, it was not.

6711
07:05:30,560 --> 07:05:33,380
Okay, at least if I can go and see what it looks like...

6712
07:05:33,380 --> 07:05:34,540
I'll know where to find...

6713
07:05:34,540 --> 07:05:36,920
Or how to locate the other ones.

6714
07:05:46,070 --> 07:05:46,510
Here.

6715
07:05:51,750 --> 07:05:53,930
Okay, a pillar, a pillar, a pillar.

6716
07:05:56,290 --> 07:05:57,970
A pillar, a pillar, a pillar.

6717
07:05:59,530 --> 07:06:00,210
A pillar?

6718
07:06:01,910 --> 07:06:02,750
Like this?

6719
07:06:06,110 --> 07:06:07,250
Or...

6720
07:06:07,250 --> 07:06:08,370
The right side?

6721
07:06:09,130 --> 07:06:09,570
This?

6722
07:06:16,100 --> 07:06:16,670
C4?

6723
07:06:21,220 --> 07:06:22,720
That's one!

6724
07:06:26,950 --> 07:06:29,350
How am I supposed to find these?

6725
07:06:33,030 --> 07:06:33,600
What?

6726
07:06:45,530 --> 07:06:47,830
So it looks...

6727
07:06:47,830 --> 07:06:51,170
It's like that, but...

6728
07:06:52,810 --> 07:06:53,950
What?

6729
07:06:54,610 --> 07:06:54,630
What?

6730
07:06:57,530 --> 07:07:00,030
Okay, so I just have to...

6731
07:07:00,570 --> 07:07:01,950
Run around and...

6732
07:07:01,950 --> 07:07:02,470
Guess?

6733
07:07:05,610 --> 07:07:08,010
Spend hours of battery life finding them.

6734
07:07:08,130 --> 07:07:08,730
No way!

6735
07:07:10,490 --> 07:07:13,350
Another one was in that isolated panel area...

6736
07:07:13,350 --> 07:07:15,090
When he tried using C4 instead of Nikita.

6737
07:07:16,270 --> 07:07:17,490
Access by the vent.

6738
07:07:19,450 --> 07:07:21,290
I think I know what you're talking about.

6739
07:07:22,210 --> 07:07:22,610
Wait.

6740
07:07:25,390 --> 07:07:27,610
This area I tried to use...

6741
07:07:28,810 --> 07:07:30,330
C4 instead of Nikita.

6742
07:07:33,270 --> 07:07:35,950
The one that I had to shoot the Nikita outside?

6743
07:07:47,700 --> 07:07:48,600
I can't get through here?

6744
07:07:53,700 --> 07:07:54,900
How did I get...

6745
07:07:54,900 --> 07:07:56,340
How did I get down here before?

6746
07:08:01,120 --> 07:08:02,620
A place full of puddles.

6747
07:08:04,060 --> 07:08:04,500
Oh!

6748
07:08:04,940 --> 07:08:06,520
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

6749
07:08:08,340 --> 07:08:09,340
That was in the basement.

6750
07:08:09,500 --> 07:08:10,040
Okay, okay, okay.

6751
07:08:11,340 --> 07:08:12,500
Okay, yes, yes, yes.

6752
07:08:15,680 --> 07:08:16,800
I know where that is.

6753
07:08:18,320 --> 07:08:18,760
Okay.

6754
07:08:19,100 --> 07:08:21,700
So funny, I tried using C4 in that room...

6755
07:08:21,700 --> 07:08:22,460
Only to...

6756
07:08:22,460 --> 07:08:25,120
Only to have to actually use C4 in that room!

6757
07:08:26,020 --> 07:08:26,920
Oh my gosh.

6758
07:08:27,280 --> 07:08:28,940
Thank you for keeping note of these.

6759
07:08:29,020 --> 07:08:29,880
Honestly, I...

6760
07:08:29,880 --> 07:08:30,460
Oh, whoa!

6761
07:08:31,760 --> 07:08:33,460
I never would have...

6762
07:08:34,480 --> 07:08:35,480
Thought about it.

6763
07:08:35,600 --> 07:08:36,660
That's not one.

6764
07:08:37,240 --> 07:08:40,740
I'm just looking around to see if I notice any others while I'm...

6765
07:08:40,740 --> 07:08:41,340
Here's the vent.

6766
07:08:49,120 --> 07:08:51,180
Wait, maybe I need to go down one more.

6767
07:08:52,340 --> 07:08:54,760
Do I need to go down one more?

6768
07:08:55,800 --> 07:08:56,180
Yeah.

6769
07:08:56,840 --> 07:08:57,360
Wait.

6770
07:09:01,200 --> 07:09:03,080
Is this just gonna take me to the turbine?

6771
07:09:14,830 --> 07:09:15,750
One second.

6772
07:09:16,050 --> 07:09:16,790
I think there's a B2.

6773
07:09:16,850 --> 07:09:17,490
It's B2.

6774
07:09:19,290 --> 07:09:19,850
B2.

6775
07:09:25,160 --> 07:09:26,200
Never mind!

6776
07:09:26,520 --> 07:09:26,840
What?

6777
07:09:51,370 --> 07:09:52,490
I'm confused.

6778
07:09:52,810 --> 07:09:55,630
I hate having to go through these long ass...

6779
07:10:02,890 --> 07:10:04,270
If only the vents weren't so slow.

6780
07:10:04,270 --> 07:10:08,950
I guess you take the vent if you want the slow, long, but safe way.

6781
07:10:09,070 --> 07:10:11,270
And then you go through the poison room if you're like...

6782
07:10:12,050 --> 07:10:13,090
I don't care.

6783
07:10:13,390 --> 07:10:13,930
I don't care!

6784
07:10:16,050 --> 07:10:16,450
Okay.

6785
07:10:17,430 --> 07:10:18,350
Was there a way...

6786
07:10:18,350 --> 07:10:18,750
Hold on.

6787
07:10:21,670 --> 07:10:23,710
I'm so lost in this place.

6788
07:10:23,850 --> 07:10:24,270
Oh, see!

6789
07:10:25,670 --> 07:10:26,070
What?

6790
07:10:26,670 --> 07:10:27,750
How do I get there?

6791
07:10:28,310 --> 07:10:29,870
Oh my god, I'm so lost!

6792
07:10:34,890 --> 07:10:40,190
I bet speedrunners know to...

6793
07:10:40,190 --> 07:10:40,770
Oh my god.

6794
07:10:40,930 --> 07:10:41,410
I'm an idiot.

6795
07:10:44,130 --> 07:10:44,970
Gas mask?

6796
07:10:58,650 --> 07:11:00,330
I hate, I hate, I hate my afterlife.

6797
07:11:00,550 --> 07:11:01,170
I hate my afterlife!

6798
07:11:01,590 --> 07:11:02,410
I hate my afterlife!

6799
07:11:02,650 --> 07:11:03,150
I hate my afterlife!

6800
07:11:15,260 --> 07:11:17,280
I'm lost and I...

6801
07:11:49,840 --> 07:11:51,880
It was B1 though, wasn't it?

6802
07:11:51,880 --> 07:11:52,280
What?

6803
07:11:56,660 --> 07:11:58,500
Because that's where you said to go.

6804
07:12:01,780 --> 07:12:03,260
There's only two floors!

6805
07:12:03,660 --> 07:12:05,480
Is there like another elevator somewhere?

6806
07:12:06,000 --> 07:12:06,220
What?

6807
07:12:06,320 --> 07:12:06,940
How am I...

6808
07:12:06,940 --> 07:12:07,540
Okay.

6809
07:12:07,740 --> 07:12:08,880
Oh my god, I'm...

6810
07:12:28,450 --> 07:12:32,430
I can't even go through here, but it's because I don't have an equipment.

6811
07:12:33,850 --> 07:12:34,850
And then...

6812
07:12:44,010 --> 07:12:45,250
This one?

6813
07:12:45,730 --> 07:12:49,910
I don't know anything anymore.

6814
07:12:53,790 --> 07:12:55,960
I hate this part.

6815
07:13:45,930 --> 07:13:47,310
In there?

6816
07:14:02,840 --> 07:14:05,960
There wasn't anyone in here though, right?

6817
07:14:07,660 --> 07:14:11,360
I'm just checking to make sure before I leave.

6818
07:14:12,220 --> 07:14:12,760
No.

6819
07:14:14,620 --> 07:14:16,860
I go to the vent.

6820
07:14:24,080 --> 07:14:26,340
I'm trapped in the vent.

6821
07:14:27,540 --> 07:14:28,340
Okay.

6822
07:14:31,820 --> 07:14:34,040
This place is so maze.

6823
07:14:37,460 --> 07:14:39,880
Go down or to the right?

6824
07:14:40,020 --> 07:14:40,680
I don't know.

6825
07:14:42,060 --> 07:14:42,520
Oh.

6826
07:14:43,160 --> 07:14:44,320
Do I go down?

6827
07:14:44,500 --> 07:14:45,460
I'm just gonna...

6828
07:14:45,460 --> 07:14:46,040
Wait.

6829
07:14:47,080 --> 07:14:47,780
Oh my god.

6830
07:14:53,600 --> 07:14:55,820
This is actually just the most...

6831
07:14:57,060 --> 07:15:00,780
nonsensical part of the game, so it just becomes so frustrating.

6832
07:15:02,180 --> 07:15:03,540
Down and left.

6833
07:15:05,860 --> 07:15:06,540
Wait.

6834
07:15:06,880 --> 07:15:07,700
Down this one?

6835
07:15:16,210 --> 07:15:18,670
Down and then I go left when I leave?

6836
07:15:28,660 --> 07:15:29,260
Okay.

6837
07:15:30,320 --> 07:15:31,180
I'm back.

6838
07:15:31,300 --> 07:15:32,100
I was ghost babbling.

6839
07:15:32,220 --> 07:15:33,160
Welcome back!

6840
07:15:34,680 --> 07:15:36,320
It was fine until...

6841
07:15:37,400 --> 07:15:38,100
this moment.

6842
07:15:38,240 --> 07:15:40,220
Oh my god, his butt looks like a creeper face.

6843
07:15:44,140 --> 07:15:46,320
It was really fine until...

6844
07:15:47,080 --> 07:15:48,060
just this moment.

6845
07:15:49,220 --> 07:15:51,620
This is very tedious and...

6846
07:15:51,620 --> 07:15:53,420
I'd rather go back to the box.

6847
07:15:54,040 --> 07:15:57,640
Like, why doesn't the guide have a map for this area?

6848
07:15:57,800 --> 07:15:59,680
Like, I just need a map for this hole.

6849
07:16:01,740 --> 07:16:05,380
And having to go through vents for certain parts does not help.

6850
07:16:10,500 --> 07:16:12,980
It says the ghost creeping on his butt.

6851
07:16:14,660 --> 07:16:18,320
Oh, I see it!

6852
07:16:18,360 --> 07:16:18,700
I see it!

6853
07:16:18,780 --> 07:16:19,200
I see it!

6854
07:16:19,560 --> 07:16:20,120
Oh, okay.

6855
07:16:23,220 --> 07:16:23,660
Press...

6856
07:16:24,980 --> 07:16:26,700
It's B to set.

6857
07:16:27,940 --> 07:16:28,240
Okay!

6858
07:16:29,660 --> 07:16:30,260
Alright!

6859
07:16:30,980 --> 07:16:31,640
I got that!

6860
07:16:35,910 --> 07:16:39,590
Are you able to set these before you...

6861
07:16:39,590 --> 07:16:40,090
No?

6862
07:16:41,570 --> 07:16:43,790
Before you have the codec call with Colonel?

6863
07:16:47,190 --> 07:16:47,790
No?

6864
07:16:47,930 --> 07:16:48,790
That's messed up.

6865
07:16:48,990 --> 07:16:49,610
Okay, Blue!

6866
07:16:50,450 --> 07:16:51,850
Tell me where!

6867
07:16:52,530 --> 07:16:54,610
Sorry, I'm really depending on you here.

6868
07:17:10,560 --> 07:17:11,080
I...

6869
07:17:13,780 --> 07:17:14,300
I...

6870
07:17:20,230 --> 07:17:24,350
One is in that large puddle area where the guards first talked about electric puddles.

6871
07:17:25,030 --> 07:17:26,410
Yeah, I just don't know how to get there.

6872
07:17:31,010 --> 07:17:33,830
I thought the elevator would take me there.

6873
07:17:34,410 --> 07:17:40,790
But I guess there's different elevators, which also doesn't make everything horrible and confusing at all.

6874
07:17:40,790 --> 07:17:41,950
You know?

6875
07:17:43,750 --> 07:17:45,070
Of course not!

6876
07:17:48,470 --> 07:17:54,830
Doesn't make it so much more difficult to figure out what's going on.

6877
07:17:55,110 --> 07:17:56,410
How to get anywhere.

6878
07:17:57,950 --> 07:18:00,110
There's a visual aid on game facts.

6879
07:18:00,290 --> 07:18:00,850
There is?

6880
07:18:03,530 --> 07:18:05,150
Go to basement one.

6881
07:18:05,210 --> 07:18:07,110
Yeah, that's where I tried to go before.

6882
07:18:28,850 --> 07:18:30,950
Okay, this is the elevator.

6883
07:18:31,830 --> 07:18:35,570
That I was thinking I was at.

6884
07:18:35,850 --> 07:18:38,330
But I wasn't actually at.

6885
07:18:39,730 --> 07:18:40,330
Okay.

6886
07:18:42,250 --> 07:18:43,490
This is the elevator.

6887
07:18:43,630 --> 07:18:44,570
Oh my gosh.

6888
07:18:48,200 --> 07:18:51,280
Okay, this is where I was like, why am I at B1?

6889
07:18:51,360 --> 07:18:52,120
Why isn't it working?

6890
07:18:54,280 --> 07:18:56,060
Oh my gosh.

6891
07:18:58,540 --> 07:18:59,220
To

6892
07:19:04,040 --> 07:19:04,800
the puddles!

6893
07:19:05,880 --> 07:19:07,640
Alright, now I search around.

6894
07:19:17,520 --> 07:19:19,460
We got blue on codec.

6895
07:19:20,120 --> 07:19:21,900
Blue, thank you so much.

6896
07:19:21,980 --> 07:19:22,260
Seriously.

6897
07:19:22,860 --> 07:19:27,900
Especially, you even had the idea to write it down.

6898
07:19:28,080 --> 07:19:29,640
Like, thank you so much.

6899
07:19:29,720 --> 07:19:32,460
You're saving me a crazy amount.

6900
07:19:37,060 --> 07:19:38,740
Forget what this guy does here.

6901
07:20:09,500 --> 07:20:11,200
I wanna be a box.

6902
07:20:12,860 --> 07:20:13,760
Did you see it?

6903
07:20:13,940 --> 07:20:14,860
Wait, I missed it.

6904
07:20:14,900 --> 07:20:15,840
No, I didn't see it at all.

6905
07:20:16,800 --> 07:20:18,440
Is it next to where this guy is standing?

6906
07:20:21,300 --> 07:20:21,700
Yup.

6907
07:20:34,700 --> 07:20:36,520
I do have the C4 on, right?

6908
07:20:36,880 --> 07:20:37,420
Okay, yeah.

6909
07:20:41,740 --> 07:20:42,960
I have to go now.

6910
07:20:44,380 --> 07:20:45,480
On C4.

6911
07:20:46,700 --> 07:20:47,440
Okay, and run.

6912
07:20:49,260 --> 07:20:49,740
Okay.

6913
07:20:50,960 --> 07:20:52,480
We got that one!

6914
07:20:53,000 --> 07:20:53,340
Okay!

6915
07:20:54,780 --> 07:20:55,800
Last one!

6916
07:20:59,730 --> 07:21:01,370
Last one is by the elevator here.

6917
07:21:02,650 --> 07:21:03,610
No way.

6918
07:21:03,830 --> 07:21:04,950
I looked around, I didn't see it.

6919
07:21:05,730 --> 07:21:06,130
Elevator?

6920
07:21:07,210 --> 07:21:07,730
Elevator.

6921
07:21:14,600 --> 07:21:15,800
How did you see that?

6922
07:21:16,520 --> 07:21:17,420
Oh my gosh!

6923
07:21:17,920 --> 07:21:18,920
We did it!

6924
07:21:20,380 --> 07:21:22,100
Once you get to the elevator, go left.

6925
07:21:22,160 --> 07:21:23,120
Yeah, thank you!

6926
07:21:24,880 --> 07:21:25,880
Oh my gosh.

6927
07:21:26,700 --> 07:21:28,560
Colonel, all the C4 is set.

6928
07:21:28,560 --> 07:21:36,380
Good work, but if you detonate them now, your own life will be at risk.

6929
07:21:38,260 --> 07:21:45,880
Leave your present location and detonate the C4 once you are out of the plant.

6930
07:21:46,800 --> 07:21:48,200
How do I get out of the plant?

6931
07:21:51,180 --> 07:21:53,620
Love the voice acting, thanks.

6932
07:21:54,700 --> 07:21:56,680
Snake, we've got problems.

6933
07:21:57,480 --> 07:22:00,480
Metal Gear is out on the surface again.

6934
07:22:03,440 --> 07:22:05,860
They're planning to go nuclear right now.

6935
07:22:05,940 --> 07:22:07,080
Wait, has it been three hours?

6936
07:22:07,400 --> 07:22:07,780
Oh gosh.

6937
07:22:08,660 --> 07:22:09,900
There's no time left.

6938
07:22:10,820 --> 07:22:11,200
Snake.

6939
07:22:12,840 --> 07:22:13,380
I know.

6940
07:22:14,040 --> 07:22:14,960
Light the fuse.

6941
07:22:15,180 --> 07:22:15,500
Now.

6942
07:22:15,900 --> 07:22:16,220
Wait.

6943
07:22:16,960 --> 07:22:17,200
What?

6944
07:22:17,700 --> 07:22:19,020
What if you do that?

6945
07:22:19,840 --> 07:22:20,880
Don't worry.

6946
07:22:21,780 --> 07:22:24,840
Bombs have a way of making me run faster.

6947
07:22:27,600 --> 07:22:28,620
Sorry, Snake.

6948
07:22:28,740 --> 07:22:29,420
Shut up.

6949
07:22:29,680 --> 07:22:31,260
Shut up, you knew this.

6950
07:22:32,640 --> 07:22:34,060
I can't with this guy.

6951
07:22:35,320 --> 07:22:37,340
Ordering you to take a risk like this.

6952
07:22:39,420 --> 07:22:40,440
Forget about it.

6953
07:22:40,700 --> 07:22:41,680
I'm used to it.

6954
07:22:41,720 --> 07:22:44,680
I like how, because of the way I guess our bomb was...

6955
07:22:46,480 --> 07:22:50,200
We immediately put down the C4 and then they immediately tell us...

6956
07:22:50,200 --> 07:22:53,480
Nevermind, we have to blow it up with you in there.

6957
07:22:54,780 --> 07:22:55,740
Snake.

6958
07:22:56,520 --> 07:23:01,280
Once the C4 blows, the whole structure will begin collapsing.

6959
07:23:03,400 --> 07:23:08,480
When the countdown displayed on the radar goes zero...

6960
07:23:09,160 --> 07:23:11,460
The plant will cease to exist.

6961
07:23:13,020 --> 07:23:15,760
You must reach the exit before then.

6962
07:23:16,580 --> 07:23:16,920
Okay.

6963
07:23:23,240 --> 07:23:24,200
Oh no!

6964
07:23:26,760 --> 07:23:28,160
I wish I could see.

6965
07:23:30,100 --> 07:23:30,500
Wait!

6966
07:23:30,700 --> 07:23:31,220
Oh my god.

6967
07:23:38,580 --> 07:23:39,400
That was close.

6968
07:23:41,620 --> 07:23:42,020
Hello?

6969
07:23:44,200 --> 07:23:44,600
Wait.

6970
07:23:46,300 --> 07:23:47,100
Is this...

6971
07:23:47,100 --> 07:23:48,400
I didn't mean to do that.

6972
07:23:48,480 --> 07:23:48,960
Okay, hold on.

6973
07:23:49,080 --> 07:23:49,880
I need to get rid of this.

6974
07:23:59,380 --> 07:23:59,780
Oops.

6975
07:23:59,780 --> 07:23:59,860
Oops.

6976
07:24:09,690 --> 07:24:13,550
I think I messed up.

6977
07:24:16,830 --> 07:24:19,530
I'm still trying to burn it down faster.

6978
07:24:19,990 --> 07:24:20,790
Real.

6979
07:24:20,990 --> 07:24:21,970
How do I get out?

6980
07:24:23,810 --> 07:24:25,250
I'll take that.

6981
07:24:25,370 --> 07:24:25,530
Cool.

6982
07:24:26,910 --> 07:24:28,310
Where is the exit?

6983
07:24:28,890 --> 07:24:29,310
Game?

6984
07:24:31,310 --> 07:24:32,530
Maybe down here.

6985
07:24:34,510 --> 07:24:36,110
Oh yeah, because I shimmied through.

6986
07:24:36,270 --> 07:24:36,710
That's right.

6987
07:24:37,410 --> 07:24:38,110
I shimmied through.

6988
07:24:38,330 --> 07:24:39,050
I remember now.

6989
07:24:39,990 --> 07:24:40,670
I had to shimmy.

6990
07:24:41,190 --> 07:24:42,730
And then there was this door right here.

6991
07:24:43,170 --> 07:24:43,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6992
07:24:43,730 --> 07:24:44,430
I remember, I remember.

6993
07:24:47,230 --> 07:24:48,270
Oh no!

6994
07:24:50,910 --> 07:24:52,190
The shimmy shimmy.

6995
07:24:53,790 --> 07:24:55,510
The shimmy shimmy shimmy.

6996
07:24:55,810 --> 07:24:56,830
Shimmy mimmy mimmy.

6997
07:24:57,250 --> 07:24:58,630
The shimmy shimmy shimmy.

6998
07:24:58,850 --> 07:25:00,410
The shimmy mimmy mimmy.

6999
07:25:01,750 --> 07:25:02,510
Terrible!

7000
07:25:02,750 --> 07:25:05,410
Yeah, that level really was terrible now, wasn't it?

7001
07:25:11,980 --> 07:25:14,640
Colonel, I've neutralized the plan.

7002
07:25:20,860 --> 07:25:22,980
Good work, Snake.

7003
07:25:23,680 --> 07:25:28,380
They should be incapable of a nuclear strike... now.

7004
07:25:29,360 --> 07:25:31,600
Did someone say nuclear strike now?

7005
07:25:31,980 --> 07:25:35,120
You need to destroy Metal Gear next.

7006
07:25:36,120 --> 07:25:47,100
Four F-22s have just taken off from one of our African allies' base to strike the artillery units with cruise missiles.

7007
07:25:47,620 --> 07:25:49,860
Oh, nuclear strike now!

7008
07:25:51,420 --> 07:25:59,060
Snake, as soon as the artillery is silenced, infiltrate the base and destroy Metal Gear.

7009
07:26:00,100 --> 07:26:01,020
Understood.

7010
07:26:02,740 --> 07:26:03,380
Snake.

7011
07:26:04,340 --> 07:26:05,580
What about Jimmy?

7012
07:26:05,820 --> 07:26:07,420
Oh, wow.

7013
07:26:08,480 --> 07:26:09,660
Forgot about that guy.

7014
07:26:11,480 --> 07:26:12,580
No lead so far.

7015
07:26:12,840 --> 07:26:17,120
I have not thought about Jimmy in probably like two hours, Mei Ling.

7016
07:26:19,760 --> 07:26:21,000
But I will get him.

7017
07:26:22,060 --> 07:26:24,300
Yeah, when I get my hands on Jimmy.

7018
07:26:26,000 --> 07:26:26,600
I know.

7019
07:26:28,060 --> 07:26:29,480
Wait, Snake.

7020
07:26:29,480 --> 07:26:31,340
What is it?

7021
07:26:32,460 --> 07:26:35,400
A message just came in from GILF.

7022
07:26:37,240 --> 07:26:38,840
From the General.

7023
07:26:39,780 --> 07:26:41,320
I'll forward it to you.

7024
07:26:43,520 --> 07:26:45,580
Cool, I can eat my pizza.

7025
07:26:46,380 --> 07:26:47,340
I have two slices.

7026
07:26:49,460 --> 07:26:50,640
Mr. President.

7027
07:26:52,000 --> 07:26:53,620
Why are you locked in this door?

7028
07:26:54,740 --> 07:26:55,800
Thank you for the best introduction.

7029
07:26:55,940 --> 07:26:56,740
Thank you so much.

7030
07:26:56,740 --> 07:27:06,840
You may be rejoicing over the destruction of the power plant by your faithful dog.

7031
07:27:08,040 --> 07:27:12,240
But I assure you that you celebrate in vain.

7032
07:27:17,110 --> 07:27:20,350
The warhead can be launched without the railgun.

7033
07:27:21,050 --> 07:27:31,570
I am very disappointed by the insincerity of your methods.

7034
07:27:31,590 --> 07:27:32,510
Oh, shoot.

7035
07:27:34,150 --> 07:27:39,870
I could opt for immediate reprisal, but I pride myself on being a gentle man.

7036
07:27:40,850 --> 07:27:43,310
I shall abide by my original decision.

7037
07:27:44,250 --> 07:27:45,890
I say it once more.

7038
07:27:46,670 --> 07:27:50,890
Withdraw the peacekeepers and recognize our independence.

7039
07:27:52,430 --> 07:27:57,270
If I do not hear from you within one hour, the U.S.

7040
07:27:57,310 --> 07:28:00,450
will find itself under nuclear attack.

7041
07:28:00,450 --> 07:28:02,750
I mean, all they're asking is like...

7042
07:28:04,010 --> 07:28:05,650
Notice me, senpai.

7043
07:28:05,770 --> 07:28:06,450
It's literally...

7044
07:28:10,270 --> 07:28:13,150
Would you risk it all for foolish pride?

7045
07:28:14,110 --> 07:28:17,030
Don't underestimate my resolve.

7046
07:28:18,690 --> 07:28:21,070
They want freedom and the U.S.

7047
07:28:21,110 --> 07:28:21,810
is just like...

7048
07:28:21,810 --> 07:28:23,450
We'd rather like...

7049
07:28:24,430 --> 07:28:25,190
Risk it.

7050
07:28:26,090 --> 07:28:30,210
A nuclear strike without the railgun.

7051
07:28:30,610 --> 07:28:30,950
How?

7052
07:28:32,050 --> 07:28:37,630
Metal Gear's development was a classified army project.

7053
07:28:38,230 --> 07:28:41,970
Even the CIA is not aware of all the details.

7054
07:28:42,430 --> 07:28:43,310
Okay, so you...

7055
07:28:43,830 --> 07:28:46,270
Thanks for that, McBurger.

7056
07:28:46,430 --> 07:28:47,190
You literally...

7057
07:28:47,970 --> 07:28:49,990
He was like, I don't know.

7058
07:28:50,850 --> 07:28:52,590
I wasn't asking you.

7059
07:29:00,380 --> 07:29:02,320
Thanks for your input.

7060
07:29:05,100 --> 07:29:07,120
In other words, you know Jack.

7061
07:29:08,120 --> 07:29:10,660
Like, the weasel gets it.

7062
07:29:12,080 --> 07:29:14,960
Snake, head for the maintenance base.

7063
07:29:16,140 --> 07:29:21,280
The only option now is to destroy Metal Gear itself.

7064
07:29:23,000 --> 07:29:24,460
Looks like it.

7065
07:29:25,660 --> 07:29:27,140
Alright, he knows...

7066
07:29:28,020 --> 07:29:28,580
Jimbo!

7067
07:29:29,980 --> 07:29:30,540
Jimmy!

7068
07:29:31,100 --> 07:29:32,520
Oh my god, he killed a man.

7069
07:29:33,360 --> 07:29:33,920
Snake?

7070
07:29:34,740 --> 07:29:35,900
Oh my god, Jimmy!

7071
07:29:38,860 --> 07:29:39,980
Snake, wait...

7072
07:29:39,980 --> 07:29:42,200
Isn't the power plant destroyed?

7073
07:29:42,440 --> 07:29:43,920
And we are standing right next to it.

7074
07:29:45,880 --> 07:29:46,440
Jimmy!

7075
07:29:47,200 --> 07:29:47,900
Were you safe?

7076
07:29:47,980 --> 07:29:48,960
You were safe?

7077
07:29:50,060 --> 07:29:51,940
Yeah, I got captured.

7078
07:29:52,540 --> 07:29:55,480
But this guy was in the same cell.

7079
07:29:55,480 --> 07:29:57,660
He got us out.

7080
07:29:58,560 --> 07:30:01,400
When the guards left after the explosion.

7081
07:30:03,120 --> 07:30:04,140
Same cell.

7082
07:30:04,180 --> 07:30:04,940
Who could this be?

7083
07:30:08,460 --> 07:30:09,500
But, but...

7084
07:30:09,500 --> 07:30:11,800
He took a bullet, shielding me.

7085
07:30:15,460 --> 07:30:16,140
And...

7086
07:30:16,140 --> 07:30:17,000
Who was he?

7087
07:30:18,760 --> 07:30:21,360
Lieutenant Smith of Delta Force.

7088
07:30:23,680 --> 07:30:24,980
Delta Force?

7089
07:30:25,880 --> 07:30:29,200
I thought Chris was the sole survivor.

7090
07:30:31,140 --> 07:30:32,340
Is Jimmy evil?

7091
07:30:33,920 --> 07:30:35,560
I don't trust this guy.

7092
07:30:35,780 --> 07:30:36,080
Me neither.

7093
07:30:37,440 --> 07:30:38,280
She wasn't.

7094
07:30:40,320 --> 07:30:41,520
What do you mean?

7095
07:30:43,140 --> 07:30:44,200
I don't know.

7096
07:30:45,640 --> 07:30:46,980
But the lieutenant said...

7097
07:30:47,780 --> 07:30:53,460
Chris wasn't even there when Black Chamber wiped out Delta Force.

7098
07:30:54,980 --> 07:30:56,940
Is Chris the spy?

7099
07:30:58,840 --> 07:31:01,160
Gosh, I never consider the women.

7100
07:31:07,230 --> 07:31:08,730
No, Snake.

7101
07:31:08,990 --> 07:31:09,410
Chris!

7102
07:31:11,970 --> 07:31:14,050
Anyway, that's what he said.

7103
07:31:15,110 --> 07:31:16,370
Maybe she is one of...

7104
07:31:19,110 --> 07:31:20,630
Don't be ridiculous.

7105
07:31:23,670 --> 07:31:24,930
Oh my god.

7106
07:31:25,510 --> 07:31:26,030
No.

7107
07:31:26,930 --> 07:31:28,830
I can't stand this anymore.

7108
07:31:31,090 --> 07:31:32,450
Is Metal Gear Minto?

7109
07:31:32,570 --> 07:31:33,410
It's always the women.

7110
07:31:34,010 --> 07:31:34,650
No.

7111
07:31:35,530 --> 07:31:38,750
Only one woman has betrayed us in Metal Gear.

7112
07:31:40,490 --> 07:31:41,570
Only one.

7113
07:31:44,430 --> 07:31:45,370
Oh, two.

7114
07:31:46,910 --> 07:31:47,550
Sorry.

7115
07:31:48,210 --> 07:31:50,070
Sorry, I was thinking of Eva and Naomi.

7116
07:31:51,350 --> 07:31:52,470
Or Eva at first.

7117
07:31:53,410 --> 07:31:55,550
Oh wait, and Pies.

7118
07:31:56,770 --> 07:31:58,350
Sorry, I never think of my favorites.

7119
07:32:01,030 --> 07:32:02,950
Eva, Naomi, Pies.

7120
07:32:05,790 --> 07:32:07,690
But that's Rose.

7121
07:32:08,570 --> 07:32:10,590
No, Rose was just stupid.

7122
07:32:13,030 --> 07:32:14,910
Rose doesn't actually betray you.

7123
07:32:19,120 --> 07:32:20,320
Oh, the boss?

7124
07:32:21,780 --> 07:32:23,760
Okay, you guys make a valid point.

7125
07:32:24,320 --> 07:32:25,400
I never think of the women.

7126
07:32:25,400 --> 07:32:25,940
No.

7127
07:32:30,400 --> 07:32:32,460
Naomi saved everyone though.

7128
07:32:37,450 --> 07:32:39,070
Yeah, by killing herself.

7129
07:32:39,230 --> 07:32:39,750
Thank god.

7130
07:32:40,930 --> 07:32:41,570
I'm sorry.

7131
07:32:43,310 --> 07:32:44,270
I'm just kidding.

7132
07:32:53,810 --> 07:32:55,930
I thought she was like nice.

7133
07:32:59,130 --> 07:33:00,930
No women, just the box.

7134
07:33:01,630 --> 07:33:03,590
You can't trust anyone or anything here.

7135
07:33:07,530 --> 07:33:09,530
You don't know what to believe anymore.

7136
07:33:11,370 --> 07:33:12,890
Metal Gear was a mistake too.

7137
07:33:13,790 --> 07:33:17,810
Everyone else I worked on that thing with was murdered.

7138
07:33:19,970 --> 07:33:23,190
We were all okay yesterday and just now...

7139
07:33:23,190 --> 07:33:25,250
This happened in 24 hours, that's insane.

7140
07:33:26,530 --> 07:33:27,670
I saw their dead.

7141
07:33:28,430 --> 07:33:30,610
How could that...

7142
07:33:30,610 --> 07:33:33,330
I want to go home and start over.

7143
07:33:33,330 --> 07:33:35,330
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

7144
07:33:37,430 --> 07:33:44,050
This time, make something good to make up for what I've done.

7145
07:33:46,210 --> 07:33:47,890
It's still okay, isn't it?

7146
07:33:48,670 --> 07:33:51,310
I can still start over, can't I?

7147
07:33:54,430 --> 07:34:00,170
Yeah, as long as you got the will, you can always start over.

7148
07:34:01,610 --> 07:34:03,250
It's never too late.

7149
07:34:05,050 --> 07:34:06,230
That's true.

7150
07:34:08,550 --> 07:34:09,810
Go live, Jimmy.

7151
07:34:10,390 --> 07:34:11,510
Live your little life.

7152
07:34:14,250 --> 07:34:17,410
I love how much of a blueberry snake looks like.

7153
07:34:19,210 --> 07:34:21,270
Listen, I destroyed the power plant.

7154
07:34:22,670 --> 07:34:24,310
Can they still launch a warhead?

7155
07:34:26,050 --> 07:34:28,830
Yeah, that made the railgun useless.

7156
07:34:32,310 --> 07:34:33,750
Naomi didn't betray Snake.

7157
07:34:33,810 --> 07:34:37,050
She actually betrayed the government to save Snake by altering Foxdie.

7158
07:34:43,200 --> 07:34:48,300
She betrayed Otacon, which is, in turn, a betrayal of Snake.

7159
07:34:49,740 --> 07:34:52,560
But also, she did betray Snake by giving him the Foxdie.

7160
07:34:55,320 --> 07:34:57,820
You can't tell me that Naomi did not do...

7161
07:34:58,180 --> 07:35:01,020
You can't try to make Naomi out to be the hero here.

7162
07:35:01,640 --> 07:35:02,540
She caused the mess.

7163
07:35:02,920 --> 07:35:04,820
I would hope that she fixes it.

7164
07:35:05,220 --> 07:35:07,380
It's all her fault to begin with.

7165
07:35:16,040 --> 07:35:17,240
Naomi apologizes.

7166
07:35:17,520 --> 07:35:18,320
I know, right?

7167
07:35:18,400 --> 07:35:19,360
On my channel?

7168
07:35:19,660 --> 07:35:20,840
I can't believe this.

7169
07:35:21,340 --> 07:35:22,520
I can't believe this.

7170
07:35:24,140 --> 07:35:26,320
Naomi has to have the last word...

7171
07:35:27,820 --> 07:35:28,740
What's her name?

7172
07:35:29,940 --> 07:35:30,540
Naomi...

7173
07:35:31,280 --> 07:35:31,620
Hunter.

7174
07:35:31,940 --> 07:35:32,440
Oh my god.

7175
07:35:33,480 --> 07:35:34,840
How could I forget Hunter?

7176
07:35:35,080 --> 07:35:35,460
Jaeger.

7177
07:35:37,260 --> 07:35:40,060
Naomi's stupid, stinky... hate her.

7178
07:35:41,480 --> 07:35:42,900
But I love to hate her.

7179
07:35:43,020 --> 07:35:43,940
It's so good hating her.

7180
07:35:44,060 --> 07:35:44,520
It feels good.

7181
07:35:51,800 --> 07:35:54,000
Oh no, I summoned the Hunter means Jaeger.

7182
07:35:55,240 --> 07:35:56,860
Metal Gear can...

7183
07:36:01,160 --> 07:36:02,980
The handcuffs exploded.

7184
07:36:03,260 --> 07:36:03,740
Oh my god!

7185
07:36:05,240 --> 07:36:05,800
Snake!

7186
07:36:05,800 --> 07:36:06,360
God!

7187
07:36:06,820 --> 07:36:07,100
Why?

7188
07:36:07,760 --> 07:36:12,500
I thought I could start over.

7189
07:36:13,380 --> 07:36:15,400
Is it all over?

7190
07:36:16,740 --> 07:36:17,460
Oh my god!

7191
07:36:19,100 --> 07:36:19,420
Jimmy.

7192
07:36:21,160 --> 07:36:22,000
Snake.

7193
07:36:23,600 --> 07:36:25,160
I wanna go home.

7194
07:36:25,740 --> 07:36:26,860
You're going home, buddy.

7195
07:36:27,940 --> 07:36:29,280
Jimmy, you're going home.

7196
07:36:29,820 --> 07:36:32,780
They can't make me sympathize with you, Jimmy.

7197
07:36:37,510 --> 07:36:40,110
Vipers work, most likely.

7198
07:36:41,310 --> 07:36:41,870
Booby.

7199
07:36:41,870 --> 07:36:41,910
Booby.

7200
07:36:44,110 --> 07:36:46,990
Booby traps and explosives are his specialty.

7201
07:36:48,670 --> 07:36:51,130
Probably had a mic in the cuffs too.

7202
07:36:52,550 --> 07:36:53,870
Was listening in.

7203
07:36:54,590 --> 07:36:56,030
Mint certified Naomi hater.

7204
07:36:56,170 --> 07:36:57,330
Yes, I am.

7205
07:36:57,390 --> 07:36:59,350
And I wear that title with pride.

7206
07:36:59,970 --> 07:37:02,710
Everybody hates on Rose, but not enough people hate on Naomi.

7207
07:37:03,390 --> 07:37:04,650
I like Rose.

7208
07:37:04,970 --> 07:37:05,590
So funny.

7209
07:37:07,470 --> 07:37:11,600
He deliberately blew the thing in front of Snake.

7210
07:37:12,830 --> 07:37:14,410
Oh, in front of... question mark?

7211
07:37:15,350 --> 07:37:20,070
It wasn't her decision to use Fox Die and we don't talk about... What do you mean we don't talk about MGS4?

7212
07:37:20,770 --> 07:37:21,150
What?

7213
07:37:23,930 --> 07:37:26,010
Brandon, you're drunk.

7214
07:37:26,370 --> 07:37:28,670
Stop drunk super chatting at me.

7215
07:37:29,270 --> 07:37:35,030
We don't talk about the game that made Naomi into the worst actual character in the entire series.

7216
07:37:36,390 --> 07:37:37,110
That's just...

7217
07:37:44,020 --> 07:37:44,740
No way.

7218
07:37:46,020 --> 07:37:46,380
Stop.

7219
07:37:46,740 --> 07:37:48,100
You're just trying to get a ruse out of me.

7220
07:37:48,140 --> 07:37:49,220
You're just trying to get a...

7221
07:37:52,540 --> 07:37:55,640
No, this is bait.

7222
07:37:55,920 --> 07:37:57,140
I'm getting baited hard.

7223
07:37:57,420 --> 07:37:59,740
You guys know how to bait me and I fall for it every time.

7224
07:38:00,020 --> 07:38:04,900
I'm just a little fishy and I see just a little worm dangling from a hook and I go...

7225
07:38:05,280 --> 07:38:08,180
I do it every time, but if it's about Naomi...

7226
07:38:14,130 --> 07:38:16,230
Naomi is fine if you ignore canon.

7227
07:38:18,050 --> 07:38:24,050
If you ignore her entire personality and entire plot line, Naomi is great.

7228
07:38:25,910 --> 07:38:29,230
This is your sign to play MGS5 as game never stops.

7229
07:38:36,520 --> 07:38:37,560
She is fine though.

7230
07:38:37,860 --> 07:38:42,320
Are we saying like fine as in like yeah she's fine or are we saying like she's fine?

7231
07:38:42,320 --> 07:38:43,100
I don't know.

7232
07:38:46,560 --> 07:38:48,460
I mean she is pretty.

7233
07:38:48,740 --> 07:38:49,440
She's very attractive.

7234
07:38:49,580 --> 07:38:50,100
Yeah, she's hot.

7235
07:38:50,620 --> 07:38:51,400
I'll say it.

7236
07:38:51,520 --> 07:38:52,160
Yeah, she's hot.

7237
07:38:53,720 --> 07:38:54,460
Naomi Iwuga.

7238
07:38:54,820 --> 07:38:55,860
Okay, I wouldn't go that far.

7239
07:38:57,780 --> 07:38:59,960
She even faked having a British accent.

7240
07:39:00,240 --> 07:39:02,140
Like everything about her is terrible.

7241
07:39:02,640 --> 07:39:03,820
Who does that?

7242
07:39:03,940 --> 07:39:05,260
Unless it's for attention.

7243
07:39:12,720 --> 07:39:14,420
What does this Naomi hate?

7244
07:39:14,820 --> 07:39:15,780
Newie, I don't know.

7245
07:39:15,940 --> 07:39:17,080
I don't know.

7246
07:39:18,980 --> 07:39:23,480
I don't know if you're new here, but this is an anti-Naomi zone.

7247
07:39:24,480 --> 07:39:25,640
I genuinely hate 4.

7248
07:39:25,780 --> 07:39:27,060
It is very poorly written.

7249
07:39:31,290 --> 07:39:33,610
Okay, I'm gonna continue ghost babbling.

7250
07:39:33,750 --> 07:39:35,470
I'm not gonna take the bait.

7251
07:39:40,110 --> 07:39:40,650
Viper.

7252
07:39:42,430 --> 07:39:43,170
Minto bite.

7253
07:39:43,250 --> 07:39:43,910
I'm not doing it.

7254
07:39:44,470 --> 07:39:47,110
We're playing Metal Gear Ghost Babble right now.

7255
07:39:47,190 --> 07:39:51,690
We're not arguing Naomi's charm or lack thereof.

7256
07:39:52,590 --> 07:39:54,690
I'd respect how willing you are to die on the hill.

7257
07:39:54,990 --> 07:39:56,450
You're already a ghost.

7258
07:39:58,830 --> 07:39:59,350
Snake.

7259
07:39:59,890 --> 07:40:03,390
Bison said there were 5 of the black chamber left.

7260
07:40:05,010 --> 07:40:05,850
That's right.

7261
07:40:06,670 --> 07:40:08,130
Why 5?

7262
07:40:08,410 --> 07:40:09,510
Does he mean in total?

7263
07:40:10,230 --> 07:40:11,250
Slasher Hawk.

7264
07:40:12,050 --> 07:40:13,530
Marionette Owl.

7265
07:40:14,110 --> 07:40:15,330
Pyro Bison.

7266
07:40:16,010 --> 07:40:17,570
Black Art Viper.

7267
07:40:18,450 --> 07:40:20,150
And... Chris.

7268
07:40:23,410 --> 07:40:25,350
One unaccounted for.

7269
07:40:25,590 --> 07:40:26,250
Oh my gosh!

7270
07:40:26,370 --> 07:40:26,790
Lambda!

7271
07:40:28,010 --> 07:40:28,910
Screw Naomi.

7272
07:40:29,010 --> 07:40:30,270
All my homies hate Naomi.

7273
07:40:37,160 --> 07:40:38,820
Couldn't it be her?

7274
07:40:41,060 --> 07:40:41,920
What?

7275
07:40:43,820 --> 07:40:49,960
Look, if Chris is the 5th black chamber, everything makes sense.

7276
07:40:50,640 --> 07:40:51,600
The leak.

7277
07:40:51,980 --> 07:40:52,820
The ambush.

7278
07:40:54,240 --> 07:40:56,180
What happened to Harkz?

7279
07:40:57,300 --> 07:40:59,180
What the hell are you saying?

7280
07:40:59,960 --> 07:41:00,780
Hell yeah!

7281
07:41:01,020 --> 07:41:01,460
Yeah!

7282
07:41:01,720 --> 07:41:02,020
Yeah!

7283
07:41:05,120 --> 07:41:08,500
Snake, calm down and think about this.

7284
07:41:09,060 --> 07:41:09,840
Shut up!

7285
07:41:10,060 --> 07:41:11,020
Oh, damn.

7286
07:41:11,200 --> 07:41:11,740
Okay, Snake.

7287
07:41:12,320 --> 07:41:13,320
Chris, can you hear me?

7288
07:41:17,310 --> 07:41:18,270
Chris, come in.

7289
07:41:18,370 --> 07:41:18,690
Chris!

7290
07:41:19,170 --> 07:41:23,870
Snake is getting really defensive over Chris for having known her for like 2 hours.

7291
07:41:24,390 --> 07:41:24,670
Chris!

7292
07:41:29,790 --> 07:41:31,930
Looks like that's settled.

7293
07:41:32,510 --> 07:41:33,550
She got blowed up.

7294
07:41:36,730 --> 07:41:41,310
Snake, the F-22's have already left their base.

7295
07:41:41,950 --> 07:41:45,210
And the attack will start any minute.

7296
07:41:46,450 --> 07:41:48,010
I know this is tough.

7297
07:41:49,070 --> 07:41:50,690
But get yourself together.

7298
07:41:50,990 --> 07:41:51,550
Oh, sorry.

7299
07:41:51,930 --> 07:41:54,190
To the maintenance base.

7300
07:41:57,370 --> 07:41:59,810
I'm filling in the blanks.

7301
07:42:02,630 --> 07:42:04,770
They changed the names to be more English.

7302
07:42:05,370 --> 07:42:08,110
They're named Naomi and Mike Hunter.

7303
07:42:08,290 --> 07:42:08,910
Oh, really?

7304
07:42:09,030 --> 07:42:09,710
That's so funny.

7305
07:42:10,830 --> 07:42:11,450
Understood.

7306
07:42:15,620 --> 07:42:17,220
So it's not Frank Jaeger?

7307
07:42:17,680 --> 07:42:18,380
Why Mike?

7308
07:42:19,020 --> 07:42:20,140
Frank is a...

7309
07:42:22,240 --> 07:42:23,180
Wait, what?

7310
07:42:23,360 --> 07:42:24,120
What did I say?

7311
07:42:27,600 --> 07:42:29,080
What did I say?

7312
07:42:53,020 --> 07:42:54,420
It's real though.

7313
07:42:55,420 --> 07:42:56,780
It's real though, right?

7314
07:42:57,140 --> 07:42:58,760
Impossible to learn.

7315
07:43:00,060 --> 07:43:02,840
It's been 8 hours of the stream.

7316
07:43:03,320 --> 07:43:03,320
Please!

7317
07:43:05,140 --> 07:43:05,580
No!

7318
07:43:09,670 --> 07:43:12,490
Enter the Gindran airspace.

7319
07:43:12,610 --> 07:43:13,170
Gindran.

7320
07:43:17,230 --> 07:43:19,590
Cruise missiles launch.

7321
07:43:19,690 --> 07:43:20,950
Missile launch now.

7322
07:43:21,710 --> 07:43:22,990
Oh god, I'm crying.

7323
07:43:23,470 --> 07:43:24,670
Why do you guys do this to me?

7324
07:43:24,670 --> 07:43:26,190
That was really close.

7325
07:43:27,430 --> 07:43:29,090
Oh, I can't move yet.

7326
07:43:29,190 --> 07:43:29,290
No.

7327
07:43:30,150 --> 07:43:31,450
Alright, they're attacking the artillery.

7328
07:43:34,730 --> 07:43:35,210
Boom!

7329
07:43:38,790 --> 07:43:39,550
Good job!

7330
07:43:47,730 --> 07:43:52,210
Did you say we needed to up... You did say we needed to up our game.

7331
07:43:52,830 --> 07:43:55,090
So now you're hiding it in facts?

7332
07:43:58,050 --> 07:43:59,650
Satellite confirmation in.

7333
07:44:00,750 --> 07:44:01,790
Target destroyed.

7334
07:44:03,390 --> 07:44:03,910
Snake.

7335
07:44:04,450 --> 07:44:05,370
Keep going north.

7336
07:44:05,450 --> 07:44:07,690
OK, why don't you guys do that to Metal Gear also?

7337
07:44:08,170 --> 07:44:10,750
It was so easy to destroy the artillery.

7338
07:44:10,950 --> 07:44:12,590
You can also do that to Metal Gear.

7339
07:44:13,350 --> 07:44:16,650
Infiltrate the maintenance base and destroy Metal Gear.

7340
07:44:20,170 --> 07:44:20,690
Man...

7341
07:44:22,710 --> 07:44:23,830
Golly, guys.

7342
07:44:24,250 --> 07:44:25,150
Oh, OK, nevermind.

7343
07:44:25,570 --> 07:44:27,810
I thought that was a truck I could explore.

7344
07:44:29,150 --> 07:44:31,210
Do I need to...

7345
07:44:40,050 --> 07:44:41,170
Mine D.

7346
07:44:41,650 --> 07:44:41,930
OK.

7347
07:44:43,370 --> 07:44:43,930
Oh, yes.

7348
07:44:44,510 --> 07:44:45,710
The mines are still here.

7349
07:44:46,370 --> 07:44:47,310
Good to know.

7350
07:44:48,210 --> 07:44:49,370
Na na na.

7351
07:44:50,590 --> 07:44:51,190
Nice.

7352
07:44:52,530 --> 07:44:53,550
What is this?

7353
07:44:54,290 --> 07:44:56,190
A trap, that's what that is.

7354
07:44:57,690 --> 07:44:59,350
Oh, Nikita ammo, OK.

7355
07:45:00,190 --> 07:45:01,830
Don't need that, I guess.

7356
07:45:02,250 --> 07:45:04,010
I don't know how that got here.

7357
07:45:04,690 --> 07:45:05,550
Looting time!

7358
07:45:06,910 --> 07:45:08,770
Is there anything down here?

7359
07:45:10,390 --> 07:45:12,450
We're so close to beating the game, guys.

7360
07:45:15,430 --> 07:45:16,490
We got this.

7361
07:45:17,010 --> 07:45:18,110
We got this.

7362
07:45:18,710 --> 07:45:20,830
I think next I have to fight the helicopter, right?

7363
07:45:20,930 --> 07:45:21,570
And then I fight...

7364
07:45:24,470 --> 07:45:25,290
Metal Gear.

7365
07:45:29,470 --> 07:45:30,590
Oh, I think I'm good.

7366
07:45:41,440 --> 07:45:42,980
OK, we'll go past the artillery.

7367
07:45:45,580 --> 07:45:47,680
I disagree with you on this, but I still agree.

7368
07:45:49,080 --> 07:45:50,020
No ill will.

7369
07:45:50,020 --> 07:45:53,020
I'm glad we can agree to disagree, Brandon.

7370
07:45:54,560 --> 07:45:58,500
I understand why people would not have a problem with her.

7371
07:46:00,540 --> 07:46:03,220
I think it's just... she's just so silly.

7372
07:46:04,420 --> 07:46:06,440
And I really don't like how she treated Otacon.

7373
07:46:08,300 --> 07:46:08,880
Grenade!

7374
07:46:11,980 --> 07:46:13,140
More grenade!

7375
07:46:14,520 --> 07:46:15,800
No, I hate her.

7376
07:46:18,080 --> 07:46:18,560
Ration!

7377
07:46:19,300 --> 07:46:20,700
How many rations do I have?

7378
07:46:22,420 --> 07:46:24,020
Can I still only hold two?

7379
07:46:24,240 --> 07:46:25,500
Oh, I have three now!

7380
07:46:25,740 --> 07:46:26,460
Let's go.

7381
07:46:28,000 --> 07:46:30,260
Keep up my mind just in case.

7382
07:46:31,300 --> 07:46:31,860
No, no, no!

7383
07:46:39,390 --> 07:46:39,870
Chris?

7384
07:46:49,090 --> 07:46:50,390
In front of my salad?

7385
07:46:54,950 --> 07:46:55,730
Oh my god.

7386
07:46:56,430 --> 07:46:57,550
Oh my god, oh my god.

7387
07:46:57,550 --> 07:46:59,630
OK, wow.

7388
07:46:59,990 --> 07:47:01,290
OK, let's see.

7389
07:47:01,790 --> 07:47:02,290
Body armor.

7390
07:47:04,250 --> 07:47:06,690
And what would be best for this?

7391
07:47:07,550 --> 07:47:11,170
They gave me Nikita missiles and grenades.

7392
07:47:11,590 --> 07:47:12,710
I'm gonna try the grenades.

7393
07:47:17,110 --> 07:47:18,910
How do I use these again?

7394
07:47:19,130 --> 07:47:20,490
Sorry, hold on.

7395
07:47:25,640 --> 07:47:25,960
Ouch!

7396
07:47:26,420 --> 07:47:27,640
Oh gosh, the splash damage.

7397
07:47:35,170 --> 07:47:36,870
Is he on this side now?

7398
07:47:38,730 --> 07:47:39,410
Where is he?

7399
07:47:39,490 --> 07:47:44,090
Oh my gosh, he hits so hard even with the...

7400
07:47:44,090 --> 07:47:46,130
Even with the body armor.

7401
07:47:46,490 --> 07:47:47,030
Yikes!

7402
07:47:48,790 --> 07:47:49,350
Yikes!

7403
07:47:53,510 --> 07:47:56,170
Oh dang it, oh dang it, oh dang it!

7404
07:48:00,540 --> 07:48:01,680
Oh my gosh.

7405
07:48:03,640 --> 07:48:04,920
I got him.

7406
07:48:05,860 --> 07:48:06,860
Didn't do so much though.

7407
07:48:07,620 --> 07:48:10,080
Maybe, you know what, I am gonna do the Nikita.

7408
07:48:15,610 --> 07:48:17,210
How many do I have with that?

7409
07:48:17,690 --> 07:48:18,210
Twelve.

7410
07:48:21,970 --> 07:48:23,490
Oh my gosh, splash damage.

7411
07:48:28,600 --> 07:48:29,400
Splash damage!

7412
07:48:31,680 --> 07:48:32,420
Oh my gosh.

7413
07:48:34,380 --> 07:48:36,660
Now would be a good time to take a...

7414
07:48:44,700 --> 07:48:45,900
Thank you for...

7415
07:48:45,900 --> 07:48:46,620
What the heck is going on?

7416
07:48:47,040 --> 07:48:49,200
I can't read it right now.

7417
07:48:51,780 --> 07:48:53,300
Why am I...

7418
07:48:53,300 --> 07:48:54,180
I'm such an idiot.

7419
07:48:54,460 --> 07:48:55,100
I'm so stupid.

7420
07:48:55,940 --> 07:48:57,540
I'm so dumb.

7421
07:49:12,380 --> 07:49:13,720
Did that work?

7422
07:49:15,960 --> 07:49:17,400
How is this happening?

7423
07:49:17,920 --> 07:49:19,080
I don't understand.

7424
07:49:19,920 --> 07:49:21,100
How is this happening?

7425
07:49:24,700 --> 07:49:25,340
What?

7426
07:49:33,360 --> 07:49:34,680
I was sideways!

7427
07:49:35,960 --> 07:49:37,780
You guys saw that, right?

7428
07:49:46,490 --> 07:49:47,550
Gosh dang it.

7429
07:49:48,690 --> 07:49:49,990
I don't like this fight.

7430
07:49:52,250 --> 07:49:55,790
I think this one probably will take another try, but that's OK.

7431
07:49:57,190 --> 07:49:57,870
That's OK.

7432
07:49:58,470 --> 07:50:00,150
Good thing we have the body armor.

7433
07:50:00,330 --> 07:50:02,330
Holy hell, if we didn't...

7434
07:50:10,940 --> 07:50:12,260
Practice run, yeah.

7435
07:50:15,140 --> 07:50:16,300
Where did he go?

7436
07:50:16,440 --> 07:50:16,860
There we go.

7437
07:50:17,460 --> 07:50:18,000
Did that work?

7438
07:50:21,040 --> 07:50:22,300
You can shoot your missiles.

7439
07:50:22,420 --> 07:50:23,720
Yeah, I got that.

7440
07:50:25,620 --> 07:50:29,660
I don't understand why that keeps happening.

7441
07:50:30,300 --> 07:50:31,860
I actually...

7442
07:50:31,860 --> 07:50:35,340
Is it blowing up through the rock?

7443
07:50:35,440 --> 07:50:37,760
Like, I just... I'm so confused.

7444
07:50:38,500 --> 07:50:39,940
Oh my god, please, please, please.

7445
07:50:41,680 --> 07:50:42,240
What?

7446
07:50:56,180 --> 07:50:58,640
Oh, this is so... This is so fucked.

7447
07:50:59,040 --> 07:51:00,400
This is actually so fucked.

7448
07:51:10,190 --> 07:51:12,090
Let's go back to grenades, I guess.

7449
07:51:13,110 --> 07:51:15,330
And I won't use this for the second round.

7450
07:51:16,710 --> 07:51:18,690
I won't use this for round 2.

7451
07:51:31,590 --> 07:51:34,670
At least he has a pretty high range of...

7452
07:51:40,900 --> 07:51:41,440
Like...

7453
07:51:41,440 --> 07:51:43,440
I guess...

7454
07:51:49,060 --> 07:51:49,820
Kodak time?

7455
07:51:49,940 --> 07:51:50,620
No, I don't think...

7456
07:51:50,620 --> 07:51:52,760
Oh my god, how does he get me through the rock?

7457
07:51:55,540 --> 07:51:58,380
This guy is so... He's using unfair tactics!

7458
07:51:58,560 --> 07:52:01,660
What's the point of the rock to protect me from that?

7459
07:52:16,020 --> 07:52:17,660
Oh my god, I threw it the wrong way.

7460
07:52:18,880 --> 07:52:19,320
Hell.

7461
07:52:23,600 --> 07:52:25,120
I'm basically just...

7462
07:52:33,660 --> 07:52:34,380
Ah!

7463
07:52:35,900 --> 07:52:36,740
What the hell?

7464
07:52:37,880 --> 07:52:38,680
More grenade!

7465
07:52:39,900 --> 07:52:41,460
I wish there was ration.

7466
07:52:42,060 --> 07:52:43,400
Is there any down here?

7467
07:52:43,460 --> 07:52:43,940
Let's check.

7468
07:52:44,320 --> 07:52:45,180
There might be some.

7469
07:52:48,400 --> 07:52:49,580
No ration?

7470
07:52:49,760 --> 07:52:50,380
That's cruel.

7471
07:52:52,900 --> 07:52:54,240
No ration is cruel.

7472
07:52:55,920 --> 07:52:57,720
How are the missiles doing that?

7473
07:52:59,120 --> 07:53:00,620
I don't think that's...

7474
07:53:15,710 --> 07:53:17,710
OK, when he shoots again...

7475
07:53:18,870 --> 07:53:20,490
And then when he stops...

7476
07:53:20,490 --> 07:53:22,710
Whenever that is...

7477
07:53:25,310 --> 07:53:29,930
I got him to half health, but I've used all my rations, so...

7478
07:53:29,930 --> 07:53:32,130
Honestly, I don't think I have any left, right?

7479
07:53:32,210 --> 07:53:32,930
Let me double check.

7480
07:53:37,010 --> 07:53:38,010
Nope, none left.

7481
07:53:38,070 --> 07:53:39,050
OK, this is fine.

7482
07:53:40,230 --> 07:53:41,410
Try and fist fight it.

7483
07:53:41,410 --> 07:53:41,750
Yeah!

7484
07:53:43,790 --> 07:53:44,490
Oh my god.

7485
07:53:58,260 --> 07:53:59,320
Still avoid this!

7486
07:53:59,940 --> 07:54:01,560
With the rocks, don't help me!

7487
07:54:02,760 --> 07:54:03,760
How the hell?

7488
07:54:04,260 --> 07:54:04,800
Oh my god.

7489
07:54:12,140 --> 07:54:14,520
OK, there was...

7490
07:54:14,520 --> 07:54:16,080
Oh, OK, it starts me back down here.

7491
07:54:16,140 --> 07:54:16,400
You know what?

7492
07:54:16,400 --> 07:54:16,860
This is fine.

7493
07:54:20,440 --> 07:54:21,360
I'll take that.

7494
07:54:21,400 --> 07:54:22,460
I don't think I grabbed that before.

7495
07:54:23,600 --> 07:54:23,900
Wait.

7496
07:54:28,820 --> 07:54:29,460
Oh!

7497
07:54:30,340 --> 07:54:32,400
I've wasted all my rations!

7498
07:54:32,940 --> 07:54:33,280
No!

7499
07:54:33,580 --> 07:54:34,960
I have no more!

7500
07:54:37,660 --> 07:54:39,780
It didn't give me the ones!

7501
07:54:40,040 --> 07:54:41,260
Oh gosh!

7502
07:54:42,220 --> 07:54:42,580
No!

7503
07:54:43,220 --> 07:54:45,700
I didn't save, so I can't load... What?

7504
07:54:47,740 --> 07:54:48,380
No!

7505
07:54:49,660 --> 07:54:50,300
No!

7506
07:54:53,370 --> 07:54:54,350
Oh wait, I have three!

7507
07:54:54,530 --> 07:54:55,070
I'm sorry.

7508
07:54:55,750 --> 07:54:56,830
Sorry, I'm... OK.

7509
07:54:56,830 --> 07:54:56,930
OK.

7510
07:54:58,270 --> 07:54:59,210
Wait, I see.

7511
07:54:59,310 --> 07:54:59,670
I have three.

7512
07:54:59,770 --> 07:54:59,970
Sorry.

7513
07:55:00,230 --> 07:55:00,450
OK.

7514
07:55:00,870 --> 07:55:02,210
I'm losing it, you guys, for real.

7515
07:55:03,650 --> 07:55:04,330
I have three.

7516
07:55:07,690 --> 07:55:08,910
Oh, goodness gracious.

7517
07:55:11,910 --> 07:55:12,990
OK, more grenades!

7518
07:55:13,630 --> 07:55:14,110
Nice!

7519
07:55:16,110 --> 07:55:17,310
Grenade all the way!

7520
07:55:18,730 --> 07:55:19,690
I'm losing it.

7521
07:55:19,770 --> 07:55:20,430
I'm losing it.

7522
07:55:21,990 --> 07:55:22,470
Chris.

7523
07:55:23,170 --> 07:55:23,650
Chris!

7524
07:55:23,650 --> 07:55:24,490
Chris!

7525
07:55:25,110 --> 07:55:27,530
Guys, how many phases are in this fight?

7526
07:55:29,150 --> 07:55:29,790
I wonder.

7527
07:55:31,390 --> 07:55:32,190
I'm scared.

7528
07:55:36,150 --> 07:55:37,990
I wonder if Chaff does anything.

7529
07:55:41,250 --> 07:55:43,530
Oh, that's not where that is.

7530
07:55:43,530 --> 07:55:43,770
What?

7531
07:55:53,820 --> 07:55:56,620
I like when he's up here and shooting those things.

7532
07:55:56,700 --> 07:55:57,800
I wish he did that more often.

7533
07:55:59,200 --> 07:56:00,360
No, no, please God!

7534
07:56:00,480 --> 07:56:02,900
I don't know how to avoid you when you're like this!

7535
07:56:03,600 --> 07:56:04,980
I don't know how to avoid these!

7536
07:56:06,500 --> 07:56:07,860
I don't know how to avoid these!

7537
07:56:08,840 --> 07:56:09,020
Why?

7538
07:56:10,000 --> 07:56:11,360
It makes no sense!

7539
07:56:12,300 --> 07:56:13,600
Maybe I have to be closer?

7540
07:56:13,600 --> 07:56:13,700
Closer?

7541
07:56:16,120 --> 07:56:17,400
I don't know.

7542
07:56:17,700 --> 07:56:18,700
How to avoid you!

7543
07:56:19,700 --> 07:56:20,660
I don't know!

7544
07:56:21,360 --> 07:56:22,040
OK.

7545
07:56:22,880 --> 07:56:23,220
Alright.

7546
07:56:24,020 --> 07:56:24,940
He's back here.

7547
07:56:32,030 --> 07:56:32,710
Ouch!

7548
07:56:33,030 --> 07:56:33,190
OK.

7549
07:56:54,050 --> 07:56:54,730
Nice!

7550
07:56:55,350 --> 07:56:56,510
Yes, keep doing this.

7551
07:56:57,830 --> 07:56:57,830
I

7552
07:57:02,460 --> 07:57:04,200
wonder.

7553
07:57:08,190 --> 07:57:10,210
If I hug the wall...

7554
07:57:11,470 --> 07:57:12,830
Wesker Chris!

7555
07:57:20,990 --> 07:57:22,330
Now it's an even fight.

7556
07:57:24,270 --> 07:57:24,890
Oh my God!

7557
07:57:26,210 --> 07:57:27,550
Well, you know.

7558
07:57:28,770 --> 07:57:29,370
Ouch!

7559
07:57:29,730 --> 07:57:31,830
Give me a second to get behind this rock please.

7560
07:57:34,890 --> 07:57:35,570
OK.

7561
07:57:36,370 --> 07:57:37,010
Item.

7562
07:57:57,700 --> 07:57:58,700
Come on.

7563
07:58:03,940 --> 07:58:05,960
I'm just gonna wait for him to get to the front again.

7564
07:58:09,920 --> 07:58:11,620
Come on, go to the front please.

7565
07:58:12,460 --> 07:58:13,320
Go to the front.

7566
07:58:15,740 --> 07:58:16,480
Oh my God!

7567
07:58:16,560 --> 07:58:17,840
Wait, it doesn't work every time!

7568
07:58:17,960 --> 07:58:18,680
That's messed up.

7569
07:58:21,760 --> 07:58:22,140
Oh my God.

7570
07:58:28,700 --> 07:58:29,560
Oh my God.

7571
07:58:29,560 --> 07:58:30,420
No!

7572
07:58:30,760 --> 07:58:31,180
This is

7573
07:58:35,340 --> 07:58:35,800
so...

7574
07:58:35,800 --> 07:58:40,960
I can't even move before he starts attacking me again in my...

7575
07:58:40,960 --> 07:58:41,320
See!

7576
07:58:42,040 --> 07:58:44,080
It's so unfair!

7577
07:58:46,900 --> 07:58:48,560
Even fight my ass.

7578
07:58:48,620 --> 07:58:50,540
This guy is so not playing fair.

7579
07:59:02,260 --> 07:59:03,360
Oh thank God.

7580
07:59:14,750 --> 07:59:15,690
Oh my gosh.

7581
07:59:15,830 --> 07:59:15,970
Oops.

7582
07:59:22,740 --> 07:59:23,660
Just a little bit more!

7583
07:59:24,660 --> 07:59:25,960
Wait!

7584
07:59:26,680 --> 07:59:28,280
Just a little bit more!

7585
07:59:36,160 --> 07:59:37,560
Still

7586
07:59:41,520 --> 07:59:42,920
going?

7587
07:59:43,080 --> 07:59:43,280
OK.

7588
07:59:47,860 --> 07:59:50,660
He crashed!

7589
07:59:52,620 --> 07:59:54,020
No phase 2?

7590
07:59:58,300 --> 07:59:59,440
This guy!

7591
08:00:01,220 --> 08:00:01,980
Terrible!

7592
08:00:16,600 --> 08:00:17,360
Chris!

7593
08:00:18,360 --> 08:00:19,480
No you're not.

7594
08:00:22,940 --> 08:00:24,800
Sorry to disappoint you.

7595
08:00:28,000 --> 08:00:29,340
Oh it's her!

7596
08:00:29,920 --> 08:00:30,960
The sexy lady.

7597
08:00:32,220 --> 08:00:33,700
Let me read your Akasupa.

7598
08:00:37,360 --> 08:00:41,900
Naomi is a hot sociopathic narcissist and we should all remember the terrible things she did.

7599
08:00:41,900 --> 08:00:45,900
Just because she helped us during MGS4...

7600
08:00:57,080 --> 08:00:59,180
Doesn't mean we should support her.

7601
08:00:59,960 --> 08:01:01,340
But yes, she's very pretty.

7602
08:01:01,480 --> 08:01:02,380
Kojima knows hot.

7603
08:01:08,000 --> 08:01:11,420
Fool me once, shame on me.

7604
08:01:11,760 --> 08:01:13,100
Fool me twice.

7605
08:01:14,100 --> 08:01:15,120
Ain't gonna happen.

7606
08:01:17,680 --> 08:01:18,900
Good try though.

7607
08:01:20,540 --> 08:01:21,340
Good try.

7608
08:01:39,640 --> 08:01:41,880
I think you've been fooled a few more times.

7609
08:01:42,080 --> 08:01:43,360
Hey, not in this stream.

7610
08:01:43,480 --> 08:01:44,600
Well actually I don't know in this stream.

7611
08:01:44,840 --> 08:01:45,040
Whatever.

7612
08:01:49,260 --> 08:01:50,700
For his life?

7613
08:01:51,960 --> 08:01:54,880
No, but I don't plan on being killed by you.

7614
08:01:55,540 --> 08:01:57,320
My, you're pretty confident.

7615
08:01:59,360 --> 08:02:00,920
You're all being used.

7616
08:02:01,060 --> 08:02:03,620
OK, that's rich coming from you Snake.

7617
08:02:05,120 --> 08:02:06,800
Are you talking about Black Chamber?

7618
08:02:08,240 --> 08:02:10,680
No, actually we're the ones using them.

7619
08:02:11,400 --> 08:02:12,400
The one using them.

7620
08:02:12,460 --> 08:02:13,340
Wait, oh?

7621
08:02:15,340 --> 08:02:17,680
Revenge against Foxhound and the US?

7622
08:02:17,680 --> 08:02:19,980
We know their real objective.

7623
08:02:22,020 --> 08:02:24,100
You know and... oh wait.

7624
08:02:24,520 --> 08:02:25,740
You know and still...

7625
08:02:29,040 --> 08:02:29,760
Yes.

7626
08:02:30,720 --> 08:02:35,260
Exploitation in the name of justice and ideals.

7627
08:02:37,460 --> 08:02:39,820
We have all the aces now.

7628
08:02:40,280 --> 08:02:42,180
Why don't you use the sexy voice more often?

7629
08:02:43,100 --> 08:02:43,820
Because...

7630
08:02:43,820 --> 08:02:47,520
Because it's hard on my throat.

7631
08:02:52,580 --> 08:02:55,400
They'll be mad if I kill you here, won't they?

7632
08:02:57,420 --> 08:02:57,900
Justice.

7633
08:03:00,660 --> 08:03:03,060
The justice and order being given...

7634
08:03:03,060 --> 08:03:05,400
Or rather, it's not hard on my throat, it's just really uncomfortable.

7635
08:03:05,920 --> 08:03:06,500
Is all.

7636
08:03:06,980 --> 08:03:09,900
Because I have to like, open my throat up.

7637
08:03:10,340 --> 08:03:12,520
It's just kind of uncomfortable for me, is all.

7638
08:03:13,820 --> 08:03:19,740
In your society applies only to that world.

7639
08:03:21,160 --> 08:03:23,120
Free trade, world order.

7640
08:03:24,100 --> 08:03:29,980
All the trappings of your private, exclusive ethics that keep bleeding.

7641
08:03:30,700 --> 08:03:31,740
Gindra.

7642
08:03:33,300 --> 08:03:37,320
For the sake of first world prosperity.

7643
08:03:38,920 --> 08:03:41,700
We finally said no more.

7644
08:03:41,700 --> 08:03:46,760
And troops were sent to bar our way.

7645
08:03:49,380 --> 08:03:54,640
But this time, we will break free of first world meddling.

7646
08:03:55,820 --> 08:03:58,180
Is that your ideal?

7647
08:03:58,980 --> 08:04:00,220
Or the general's?

7648
08:04:01,460 --> 08:04:01,980
Mine.

7649
08:04:04,500 --> 08:04:05,940
It's 12 AM Eastern.

7650
08:04:06,060 --> 08:04:08,080
Oh my gosh, it's 12 AM Eastern.

7651
08:04:08,080 --> 08:04:10,040
It's my pal Isaac's birthday.

7652
08:04:10,360 --> 08:04:11,980
Do you mind singing a sweet tune for Isaac?

7653
08:04:12,960 --> 08:04:13,460
Isaac.

7654
08:04:17,570 --> 08:04:20,590
So I can surprise him with something in the morning.

7655
08:04:21,790 --> 08:04:22,550
Yeah.

7656
08:04:24,570 --> 08:04:25,450
Isaac.

7657
08:04:28,310 --> 08:04:32,190
Happy birthday to you.

7658
08:04:32,930 --> 08:04:37,010
Happy birthday to you.

7659
08:04:38,010 --> 08:04:43,690
Happy birthday dear Isaac.

7660
08:04:44,490 --> 08:04:45,430
Wiener.

7661
08:05:02,710 --> 08:05:05,120
Happy birthday Mr. Wiener.

7662
08:05:05,520 --> 08:05:06,520
Oh my gosh.

7663
08:05:08,440 --> 08:05:11,640
What a great friend Mr. Wiener has.

7664
08:05:13,840 --> 08:05:15,420
That was a good shot.

7665
08:05:17,340 --> 08:05:18,680
That's a lie.

7666
08:05:19,800 --> 08:05:21,140
Oh my god.

7667
08:05:21,820 --> 08:05:23,740
Did the helicopter explode?

7668
08:05:28,870 --> 08:05:31,150
The tables have turned I see.

7669
08:05:31,810 --> 08:05:33,550
I have the turns tabled.

7670
08:05:36,330 --> 08:05:38,470
Will you plead for your life?

7671
08:05:39,470 --> 08:05:42,190
$10 to MGSCon because you said Wiener.

7672
08:05:42,270 --> 08:05:43,170
Keep it up boss.

7673
08:05:43,250 --> 08:05:43,870
Thanks.

7674
08:05:45,870 --> 08:05:46,790
No,

7675
08:05:49,990 --> 08:05:51,670
I'm not afraid to die.

7676
08:05:53,790 --> 08:05:55,210
For the ideal?

7677
08:05:57,050 --> 08:05:57,510
Yes.

7678
08:05:58,770 --> 08:06:00,490
Why so fervent?

7679
08:06:02,850 --> 08:06:07,190
Have you ever been treated like a piece of dirt?

7680
08:06:07,190 --> 08:06:11,330
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag?

7681
08:06:15,680 --> 08:06:17,500
My father was French.

7682
08:06:28,130 --> 08:06:30,170
Have you ever felt like dirt?

7683
08:06:30,770 --> 08:06:32,810
My father was French.

7684
08:06:41,720 --> 08:06:43,780
This song is so good.

7685
08:06:43,920 --> 08:06:45,060
Wait, I think I've heard it before.

7686
08:06:51,680 --> 08:06:53,380
I fully forgive her.

7687
08:06:56,640 --> 08:06:57,560
Sacre bleu.

7688
08:06:58,960 --> 08:07:00,620
Your father was French?

7689
08:07:04,780 --> 08:07:06,340
Every day he fed me baguettes.

7690
08:07:07,120 --> 08:07:08,900
And every night he fed me escargots.

7691
08:07:10,380 --> 08:07:12,740
Correct me if I'm wrong but I think Eric...

7692
08:07:14,000 --> 08:07:14,920
Eric Sean.

7693
08:07:16,160 --> 08:07:17,880
That's not a bait is it?

7694
08:07:17,940 --> 08:07:19,700
Some of the pixel art for this game.

7695
08:07:19,760 --> 08:07:20,760
I love the way it looks.

7696
08:07:22,740 --> 08:07:25,360
Is that a bait name?

7697
08:07:26,900 --> 08:07:28,280
It is?

7698
08:07:34,090 --> 08:07:34,690
How?

7699
08:07:35,410 --> 08:07:37,010
How is it a bait name?

7700
08:07:39,310 --> 08:07:40,550
Eric Sean.

7701
08:07:41,370 --> 08:07:43,750
Eric... Eric Sean.

7702
08:07:45,430 --> 08:07:47,430
Eric... Sean.

7703
08:07:47,930 --> 08:07:48,730
Eric Sean.

7704
08:07:49,730 --> 08:07:50,730
Eric...

7705
08:07:51,530 --> 08:07:53,110
I don't get it.

7706
08:07:53,150 --> 08:07:53,450
Tell me.

7707
08:07:55,070 --> 08:07:55,870
Erection.

7708
08:08:01,200 --> 08:08:02,320
Eric Sean.

7709
08:08:02,540 --> 08:08:03,160
Eric Sean.

7710
08:08:05,920 --> 08:08:07,260
Eric Sean.

7711
08:08:09,440 --> 08:08:13,360
I switched tabs for a second and realized the con in MGSCon...

7712
08:08:16,400 --> 08:08:18,000
No way.

7713
08:08:18,380 --> 08:08:18,780
No.

7714
08:08:19,600 --> 08:08:20,140
How?

7715
08:08:28,860 --> 08:08:30,520
Oh god, I'm so sorry.

7716
08:08:33,820 --> 08:08:34,640
Okay.

7717
08:08:37,220 --> 08:08:38,040
Sophie.

7718
08:08:39,080 --> 08:08:43,300
He met my mother after his farm sent him to Gindra.

7719
08:08:44,020 --> 08:08:45,120
And I was born.

7720
08:08:46,340 --> 08:08:49,580
But she was nothing but a little local.

7721
08:08:50,340 --> 08:08:51,260
Color to him.

7722
08:08:52,340 --> 08:08:56,620
When his term was over, he went back to France.

7723
08:08:57,120 --> 08:08:59,800
Without giving us a second thought.

7724
08:08:59,800 --> 08:09:02,060
The accent changed.

7725
08:09:03,960 --> 08:09:05,980
I was still just a baby.

7726
08:09:07,260 --> 08:09:08,960
I went to see him once.

7727
08:09:09,420 --> 08:09:10,180
I was grown.

7728
08:09:11,440 --> 08:09:14,660
But all he did was give me some money.

7729
08:09:15,220 --> 08:09:19,140
And demanded that I never bother him again.

7730
08:09:21,580 --> 08:09:25,200
As soon as the French lord dropped...

7731
08:09:25,200 --> 08:09:27,920
Their monitor was really loyal to the con.

7732
08:09:28,080 --> 08:09:28,940
I'm so sorry.

7733
08:09:30,320 --> 08:09:31,920
I learned that...

7734
08:09:31,920 --> 08:09:40,360
That day that neither I nor my country could expect anything better than that.

7735
08:09:40,640 --> 08:09:42,980
Okay, I'm really not good at French accents.

7736
08:09:43,480 --> 08:09:45,400
From your kind.

7737
08:09:47,740 --> 08:09:51,160
I used the money for university education.

7738
08:09:51,940 --> 08:09:52,880
In Britain.

7739
08:09:52,880 --> 08:09:58,620
To take the knowledge and the skills back to Gindra.

7740
08:09:59,240 --> 08:10:01,360
While I was there...

7741
08:10:01,360 --> 08:10:04,400
The genocide policy went into effect.

7742
08:10:05,160 --> 08:10:07,040
My mother and...

7743
08:10:07,040 --> 08:10:10,880
Wait, why does it sound more Australian than...

7744
08:10:13,360 --> 08:10:14,620
Nice Aussie.

7745
08:10:14,800 --> 08:10:16,820
It sounds more Australian than British.

7746
08:10:18,460 --> 08:10:21,460
Oh my gosh, I've never been able to do an Australian accent though.

7747
08:10:22,880 --> 08:10:24,380
You're all over the map.

7748
08:10:24,980 --> 08:10:26,100
Okay, her tragic backstory.

7749
08:10:26,600 --> 08:10:27,320
Tragic backstory.

7750
08:10:28,640 --> 08:10:31,360
Died at the hands of government soldiers.

7751
08:10:32,460 --> 08:10:35,700
I flew back to Gindra and joined Gilf.

7752
08:10:36,420 --> 08:10:38,940
Deeds, not words, I thought.

7753
08:10:40,600 --> 08:10:44,100
But the government was winning.

7754
08:10:45,460 --> 08:10:47,680
And we were almost gone.

7755
08:10:48,880 --> 08:10:52,120
That's when he, the general, appeared.

7756
08:10:52,780 --> 08:10:54,400
She's very sniper-wolf coated.

7757
08:10:55,720 --> 08:10:58,180
Suddenly, turned things around.

7758
08:11:00,600 --> 08:11:06,060
Plentiful funds, new weapons, and most of all...

7759
08:11:06,060 --> 08:11:07,520
The ideals he brought us.

7760
08:11:08,500 --> 08:11:11,040
A true independence for our people.

7761
08:11:12,400 --> 08:11:15,200
A country for ourselves.

7762
08:11:16,060 --> 08:11:18,260
On l'aide du fromage.

7763
08:11:19,060 --> 08:11:22,880
Everyone saw the future in him.

7764
08:11:23,660 --> 08:11:24,420
I did too.

7765
08:11:26,180 --> 08:11:30,920
There was a time when he was everything to me.

7766
08:11:32,980 --> 08:11:34,220
Is he still?

7767
08:11:36,780 --> 08:11:37,580
No.

7768
08:11:39,000 --> 08:11:39,800
Oof.

7769
08:11:40,220 --> 08:11:40,840
Rejection.

7770
08:11:41,700 --> 08:11:42,360
Goodbye, Sophie.

7771
08:11:43,060 --> 08:11:45,740
Accent disappeared like MGS1 to MGS4.

7772
08:11:47,780 --> 08:11:49,820
Let me ask you something.

7773
08:11:51,560 --> 08:11:53,660
Why did you call me a liar?

7774
08:11:55,340 --> 08:11:55,600
Call?

7775
08:11:56,360 --> 08:11:57,500
For the terrible children fund.

7776
08:11:57,580 --> 08:11:58,320
Thank you, Captain!

7777
08:12:02,460 --> 08:12:09,100
Your eyes don't have the hardness of someone who lives for that single cause.

7778
08:12:11,120 --> 08:12:18,140
Instead, you looked as though you were struggling to hold on.

7779
08:12:19,300 --> 08:12:20,480
They're rookies' eyes.

7780
08:12:22,720 --> 08:12:26,380
You are, perhaps, right about that.

7781
08:12:29,880 --> 08:12:30,680
Nevermind.

7782
08:12:32,420 --> 08:12:34,260
Oh, Snake wouldn't do that.

7783
08:12:34,260 --> 08:12:39,300
If I had a nickel for every hot black French villainess that has appeared in this...

7784
08:12:39,300 --> 08:12:42,640
Memes, brain rotting prediction mastering series, I would have two.

7785
08:12:43,260 --> 08:12:43,680
What?

7786
08:12:43,740 --> 08:12:45,580
The other one is...

7787
08:12:47,280 --> 08:12:47,800
From...

7788
08:12:47,800 --> 08:12:48,400
Revengeance?

7789
08:12:50,160 --> 08:12:51,120
I can't remember.

7790
08:12:52,060 --> 08:12:53,480
I can't remember her name though.

7791
08:12:54,000 --> 08:12:54,340
Mistral.

7792
08:12:54,480 --> 08:12:55,600
Yes, yes, yes, Mistral.

7793
08:12:56,160 --> 08:12:58,020
Thank you for the 50!

7794
08:12:58,960 --> 08:13:00,140
Thank you so much.

7795
08:13:00,960 --> 08:13:01,800
Thank you, thank you.

7796
08:13:02,960 --> 08:13:03,540
Fortune?

7797
08:13:05,300 --> 08:13:07,820
Fortune was not French, right?

7798
08:13:13,890 --> 08:13:14,870
Or was she?

7799
08:13:15,610 --> 08:13:16,810
Yeah, Fortune was not French.

7800
08:13:18,310 --> 08:13:19,130
Can I get one?

7801
08:13:20,350 --> 08:13:21,350
What's a...

7802
08:13:23,310 --> 08:13:24,590
Thanks, Freakazoid.

7803
08:13:25,810 --> 08:13:26,170
Oh, wait.

7804
08:13:27,170 --> 08:13:29,050
Oh, no.

7805
08:13:29,250 --> 08:13:29,690
I don't know.

7806
08:13:30,230 --> 08:13:30,970
Oh, gosh.

7807
08:13:31,410 --> 08:13:32,990
I took French a long time ago.

7808
08:13:34,750 --> 08:13:35,670
Fortune is American.

7809
08:13:35,810 --> 08:13:36,610
Yeah, I thought so.

7810
08:13:38,690 --> 08:13:40,090
You won't kill me?

7811
08:13:42,110 --> 08:13:43,590
I love this song during that scene.

7812
08:13:43,630 --> 08:13:45,230
No, I'm not reading anymore names.

7813
08:13:45,450 --> 08:13:47,030
I'm not doing any...

7814
08:13:47,030 --> 08:13:52,100
Out of ammo.

7815
08:13:52,440 --> 08:13:52,920
Oh, my gosh.

7816
08:13:52,920 --> 08:13:54,480
That is such a Snake thing to say.

7817
08:13:55,520 --> 08:13:57,440
No, Snake, I have five grenades right there.

7818
08:13:58,120 --> 08:13:59,320
I know you're lying.

7819
08:14:02,570 --> 08:14:03,670
You're free to go.

7820
08:14:06,710 --> 08:14:07,290
Snake.

7821
08:14:08,230 --> 08:14:09,710
Your friend is still alive.

7822
08:14:13,790 --> 08:14:15,570
Are you talking about Chris?

7823
08:14:17,770 --> 08:14:18,350
Yes.

7824
08:14:19,150 --> 08:14:20,270
Viper's taken her.

7825
08:14:21,690 --> 08:14:23,050
Go and help her.

7826
08:14:23,390 --> 08:14:24,990
Well, then who's the mole?

7827
08:14:26,970 --> 08:14:28,830
What if Jimmy didn't actually explode?

7828
08:14:29,210 --> 08:14:30,450
It was a fake explosion.

7829
08:14:30,990 --> 08:14:32,550
I know she's waiting for you.

7830
08:14:34,390 --> 08:14:36,430
I would, even if she weren't.

7831
08:14:36,430 --> 08:14:37,270
Damn.

7832
08:14:39,290 --> 08:14:40,710
She's a lucky woman.

7833
08:14:46,400 --> 08:14:51,000
She would have been luckier if she hadn't had anything to do with me.

7834
08:14:51,260 --> 08:14:51,560
Damn.

7835
08:14:51,920 --> 08:14:54,060
Okay, Snake.

7836
08:14:55,280 --> 08:14:56,800
Snake is unparalleled.

7837
08:14:56,940 --> 08:14:58,320
Everybody falls in love with the legend.

7838
08:14:59,480 --> 08:15:00,400
I doubt that.

7839
08:15:01,020 --> 08:15:02,820
I like how she looks like a...

7840
08:15:03,980 --> 08:15:07,280
She's so sexy, but they make her look like a literal troll.

7841
08:15:07,820 --> 08:15:09,140
As that sprite.

7842
08:15:09,140 --> 08:15:12,460
Like I can't... I don't understand the angle at all.

7843
08:15:12,580 --> 08:15:15,660
She's like squatting or like sitting, but she looks like...

7844
08:15:15,660 --> 08:15:17,420
Just like a grandma.

7845
08:15:17,840 --> 08:15:19,140
I don't get it.

7846
08:15:20,520 --> 08:15:22,060
FonFurco, welcome to the membership.

7847
08:15:23,020 --> 08:15:24,020
Thank you.

7848
08:15:28,180 --> 08:15:30,780
Snake, we're almost out of time.

7849
08:15:31,400 --> 08:15:34,060
Metal Gear should be further below.

7850
08:15:34,800 --> 08:15:35,160
Hurry.

7851
08:15:39,140 --> 08:15:40,840
That's what I like to see, baby.

7852
08:15:41,160 --> 08:15:41,860
What's in here?

7853
08:15:43,120 --> 08:15:43,720
Okay.

7854
08:15:47,720 --> 08:15:48,860
Wait, hold on.

7855
08:15:51,440 --> 08:15:52,320
Not grenades.

7856
08:15:54,860 --> 08:15:57,300
The music is so...

7857
08:15:57,300 --> 08:15:57,760
Cool.

7858
08:15:59,380 --> 08:16:00,320
Yeah, there we go.

7859
08:16:01,600 --> 08:16:02,140
Hello?

7860
08:16:02,460 --> 08:16:05,120
How did I... I didn't mean to...

7861
08:16:05,120 --> 08:16:06,000
I switched...

7862
08:16:06,000 --> 08:16:06,120
Wait.

7863
08:16:06,360 --> 08:16:07,340
There we go.

7864
08:16:07,440 --> 08:16:08,100
Not bad.

7865
08:16:10,420 --> 08:16:11,500
What the...

7866
08:16:12,060 --> 08:16:14,800
Why did he... Why did he jump around like that?

7867
08:16:18,740 --> 08:16:19,660
Nikita ammo?

7868
08:16:20,680 --> 08:16:23,000
Am I gonna need all of this for...

7869
08:16:23,920 --> 08:16:24,820
Metal Gear?

7870
08:16:27,940 --> 08:16:29,620
Okay, the music is weird now.

7871
08:16:33,840 --> 08:16:34,680
What?

7872
08:16:34,680 --> 08:16:36,600
It sounds like a Zelda soundtrack.

7873
08:16:42,720 --> 08:16:43,740
What's this?

7874
08:16:44,880 --> 08:16:45,320
Nice.

7875
08:16:54,000 --> 08:16:55,600
Very Link's Awakening.

7876
08:16:55,880 --> 08:16:56,580
Yeah, right?

7877
08:16:58,360 --> 08:17:00,400
I'm glad you understood what I meant.

7878
08:17:08,960 --> 08:17:10,100
It's tight.

7879
08:17:10,260 --> 08:17:11,740
It's tight.

7880
08:17:11,740 --> 08:17:12,120
It's tight.

7881
08:17:18,460 --> 08:17:19,760
We made it.

7882
08:17:21,200 --> 08:17:23,080
This is a person or a camera?

7883
08:17:26,820 --> 08:17:27,380
Camera...

7884
08:17:37,100 --> 08:17:39,220
You can't catch me through here, idiot!

7885
08:17:54,560 --> 08:17:55,460
Yeah, dummy.

7886
08:17:56,840 --> 08:17:59,580
I can't believe we are still having to explore building stuff.

7887
08:18:09,210 --> 08:18:10,010
Holy moly.

7888
08:18:10,130 --> 08:18:10,930
Oh my god.

7889
08:18:11,850 --> 08:18:12,970
These guys are ruthless.

7890
08:18:14,590 --> 08:18:16,810
Oh, these are the guys that are still...

7891
08:18:16,810 --> 08:18:17,790
Like, searching.

7892
08:18:19,790 --> 08:18:21,010
I think they are glitched.

7893
08:18:21,270 --> 08:18:21,990
They are not leaving.

7894
08:18:22,210 --> 08:18:22,610
Oh no.

7895
08:18:22,950 --> 08:18:23,750
Please leave.

7896
08:18:25,050 --> 08:18:25,850
Okay, there they go.

7897
08:18:27,090 --> 08:18:27,970
Okay, there they go.

7898
08:18:28,590 --> 08:18:29,850
Alright, the one stays.

7899
08:18:30,070 --> 08:18:30,830
Alright, there we go.

7900
08:18:33,470 --> 08:18:34,210
Ah...

7901
08:18:36,680 --> 08:18:37,340
Maybe?

7902
08:18:37,880 --> 08:18:38,800
Actually, I can't tell.

7903
08:18:44,220 --> 08:18:47,760
Is this part specifically that sounds very...

7904
08:18:47,760 --> 08:18:49,680
Very, uh...

7905
08:18:51,470 --> 08:18:53,120
Oh, that's my father.

7906
08:18:53,460 --> 08:18:54,180
I was wondering about that much.

7907
08:18:54,940 --> 08:18:57,180
Very Zelda to me.

7908
08:19:04,000 --> 08:19:07,300
What is that there that's moving so fast?

7909
08:19:07,720 --> 08:19:08,580
Is that a guy?

7910
08:19:10,440 --> 08:19:11,840
I can't tell at all.

7911
08:19:13,000 --> 08:19:14,920
Is he like a glitched guy or something?

7912
08:19:19,760 --> 08:19:21,520
What is going on up there?

7913
08:19:21,640 --> 08:19:22,900
I need to get over there.

7914
08:19:23,180 --> 08:19:23,700
Please.

7915
08:19:25,820 --> 08:19:26,800
A dog?

7916
08:19:33,520 --> 08:19:34,940
No, it's just some dude.

7917
08:19:35,820 --> 08:19:37,020
It's just some guy.

7918
08:19:38,900 --> 08:19:39,680
Look at him.

7919
08:19:46,260 --> 08:19:47,060
Hold on.

7920
08:19:47,280 --> 08:19:48,000
I know what to do here.

7921
08:19:54,590 --> 08:19:55,510
Hopefully this works.

7922
08:19:55,850 --> 08:19:56,630
It's B, right?

7923
08:20:04,890 --> 08:20:06,170
They can't come up the stairs.

7924
08:20:06,270 --> 08:20:06,730
Yes, they can.

7925
08:20:08,070 --> 08:20:08,670
We are fine.

7926
08:20:08,990 --> 08:20:09,390
C4.

7927
08:20:10,790 --> 08:20:12,030
I don't like the music though.

7928
08:20:12,150 --> 08:20:12,670
I'll be honest.

7929
08:20:13,150 --> 08:20:13,990
Not a fan of this.

7930
08:20:14,810 --> 08:20:15,690
There, there.

7931
08:20:24,060 --> 08:20:25,260
Nikita Missile!

7932
08:20:26,160 --> 08:20:26,760
Shoot!

7933
08:20:32,960 --> 08:20:33,560
OK.

7934
08:20:38,240 --> 08:20:39,960
I don't think that...

7935
08:20:39,960 --> 08:20:40,720
There is more than one?

7936
08:20:41,460 --> 08:20:41,920
I guess.

7937
08:20:42,160 --> 08:20:42,480
Up here?

7938
08:20:46,530 --> 08:20:47,450
Oh my god.

7939
08:20:47,790 --> 08:20:48,190
Wait.

7940
08:20:54,560 --> 08:20:56,000
Let's go exploring.

7941
08:20:59,020 --> 08:21:00,740
OK, nevermind.

7942
08:21:11,120 --> 08:21:11,980
Ripperoni.

7943
08:21:14,260 --> 08:21:15,720
Explodable wall?

7944
08:21:16,360 --> 08:21:17,460
I don't think so.

7945
08:21:18,460 --> 08:21:20,000
I'm afraid to go back up there.

7946
08:21:25,630 --> 08:21:28,290
I wish they gave me more stun grenades.

7947
08:21:28,450 --> 08:21:29,270
Kind of awesome.

7948
08:21:32,030 --> 08:21:33,230
C4 the wall.

7949
08:21:34,110 --> 08:21:34,830
Which one?

7950
08:21:35,010 --> 08:21:35,410
This one?

7951
08:21:39,580 --> 08:21:41,120
This wall you think is thin?

7952
08:21:46,860 --> 08:21:47,980
I can try.

7953
08:22:05,940 --> 08:22:07,360
It's not staff.

7954
08:22:08,360 --> 08:22:11,220
The grenade that gives you staff infection.

7955
08:22:18,580 --> 08:22:19,520
OK, please.

7956
08:22:19,680 --> 08:22:20,060
There we go.

7957
08:22:21,300 --> 08:22:23,560
Sometimes it's easier to do these with an analog stick.

7958
08:22:43,060 --> 08:22:45,400
How do I want to get through here I wonder.

7959
08:22:47,740 --> 08:22:49,420
Is she close to beating the game?

7960
08:22:49,520 --> 08:22:51,220
Yeah, I'm on the last mission I think.

7961
08:22:51,540 --> 08:22:52,140
Second to last?

7962
08:22:52,260 --> 08:22:53,100
Last or second to last?

7963
08:22:57,380 --> 08:22:58,220
Second to last.

7964
08:23:03,450 --> 08:23:04,630
Where do I go you guys?

7965
08:23:09,520 --> 08:23:10,870
Only one boss left.

7966
08:23:17,370 --> 08:23:20,210
OK, this guy here.

7967
08:23:21,010 --> 08:23:21,290
Really?

7968
08:23:23,130 --> 08:23:24,270
Top right?

7969
08:23:24,430 --> 08:23:25,430
Yeah, that's where I'm going.

7970
08:23:34,270 --> 08:23:36,750
I'm watching his every move.

7971
08:23:38,510 --> 08:23:39,650
I almost went.

7972
08:23:40,530 --> 08:23:42,750
Watching his every move.

7973
08:23:55,750 --> 08:23:57,690
Punch his ass.

7974
08:24:04,520 --> 08:24:05,680
I'm so tired.

7975
08:24:06,740 --> 08:24:08,500
I'm so tired everybody.

7976
08:24:09,320 --> 08:24:10,840
I'm so tired everybody.

7977
08:24:14,900 --> 08:24:16,280
I'm so tired.

7978
08:24:33,180 --> 08:24:35,180
It's really this camera I hate.

7979
08:24:36,920 --> 08:24:38,400
I don't like it.

7980
08:24:38,600 --> 08:24:42,020
It's so tricky for me.

7981
08:24:43,760 --> 08:24:44,760
Do a part two?

7982
08:24:44,980 --> 08:24:45,360
No.

7983
08:24:47,460 --> 08:24:48,820
No, no, no.

7984
08:24:48,820 --> 08:24:50,200
I'm not feeling that.

7985
08:24:50,280 --> 08:24:52,260
I'm just tired of...

7986
08:24:52,260 --> 08:24:53,560
some of these gimmicks.

7987
08:24:53,980 --> 08:24:54,560
You know what I mean?

7988
08:24:55,920 --> 08:24:57,680
I did go into this room, didn't I?

7989
08:24:58,040 --> 08:25:00,280
This is where... Yeah, they had the weapons and stuff.

7990
08:25:03,980 --> 08:25:05,400
Where's my key card?

7991
08:25:06,300 --> 08:25:06,740
Yeah.

7992
08:25:08,560 --> 08:25:09,000
Yeah.

7993
08:25:10,220 --> 08:25:11,220
I'll take more though.

7994
08:25:15,620 --> 08:25:17,340
I think my chat froze everybody.

7995
08:25:17,520 --> 08:25:18,060
I'm so sorry.

7996
08:25:22,190 --> 08:25:23,390
Hold on.

7997
08:25:23,630 --> 08:25:25,710
Let me refresh.

7998
08:25:34,760 --> 08:25:37,020
Dead chat happens every time.

7999
08:25:37,240 --> 08:25:40,080
I'm surprised

8000
08:25:46,530 --> 08:25:47,390
it happened so late here.

8001
08:25:48,030 --> 08:25:48,990
Okay, there we go.

8002
08:25:50,370 --> 08:25:50,870
Free us.

8003
08:25:50,970 --> 08:25:51,570
You're free.

8004
08:25:51,970 --> 08:25:52,710
You're free.

8005
08:25:55,690 --> 08:25:57,830
So over here was this guy.

8006
08:26:06,250 --> 08:26:07,310
I don't like this.

8007
08:26:07,410 --> 08:26:07,930
Actually...

8008
08:26:07,930 --> 08:26:10,970
I don't like the soundtrack in this area at all anymore.

8009
08:26:11,190 --> 08:26:13,290
It's like really grading me on me.

8010
08:26:15,070 --> 08:26:16,090
The little beeps.

8011
08:26:20,650 --> 08:26:22,090
Are you trying to finish this in one go?

8012
08:26:22,290 --> 08:26:22,590
Yeah.

8013
08:26:24,410 --> 08:26:25,390
I'm almost done.

8014
08:26:26,530 --> 08:26:28,510
Just a little...

8015
08:26:29,010 --> 08:26:30,170
Just a little bit left.

8016
08:26:54,680 --> 08:26:55,640
Oh please.

8017
08:26:55,800 --> 08:26:57,300
And the beep, beep, beep, beep.

8018
08:26:57,940 --> 08:26:59,540
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

8019
08:27:00,060 --> 08:27:01,600
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

8020
08:27:01,600 --> 08:27:03,700
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

8021
08:27:06,080 --> 08:27:08,280
Oh wait, I already destroyed this one.

8022
08:27:08,360 --> 08:27:09,000
I'm so stupid.

8023
08:27:10,020 --> 08:27:11,140
Okay, nevermind.

8024
08:27:12,700 --> 08:27:14,220
I'm an idiot guy everybody.

8025
08:27:14,760 --> 08:27:16,040
I'm dummy dum dum dum.

8026
08:27:20,060 --> 08:27:21,260
I can go through here.

8027
08:27:23,840 --> 08:27:24,800
And then...

8028
08:27:25,340 --> 08:27:26,260
What's down here?

8029
08:27:29,240 --> 08:27:30,360
Where does this go to?

8030
08:27:30,360 --> 08:27:33,920
Boom, boom, boom.

8031
08:27:34,080 --> 08:27:35,240
There's another elevator.

8032
08:27:35,660 --> 08:27:40,600
Oh my god, why are these buildings so big when it's like...

8033
08:27:40,600 --> 08:27:43,360
Okay, let's see if we can shoot our...

8034
08:27:48,940 --> 08:27:49,620
No!

8035
08:27:50,940 --> 08:27:53,220
These damn guns again.

8036
08:28:02,850 --> 08:28:04,210
Oh gosh.

8037
08:28:33,100 --> 08:28:33,520
Oh.

8038
08:28:35,960 --> 08:28:37,120
Why did that explode?

8039
08:28:37,260 --> 08:28:42,100
It's because the cameras there have guns on them and they explode the...

8040
08:28:43,020 --> 08:28:44,820
They explode it.

8041
08:28:48,480 --> 08:28:49,520
They blow it up.

8042
08:28:58,590 --> 08:29:00,110
What is...

8043
08:29:00,110 --> 08:29:01,690
I love you?

8044
08:29:02,350 --> 08:29:02,750
Oh.

8045
08:29:03,270 --> 08:29:04,270
I love you?

8046
08:29:05,490 --> 08:29:06,590
I love you?

8047
08:29:14,140 --> 08:29:16,100
Explain that one, somebody.

8048
08:29:28,340 --> 08:29:29,160
Yes!

8049
08:29:29,560 --> 08:29:29,980
Baby!

8050
08:29:34,100 --> 08:29:34,920
Yes!

8051
08:29:42,040 --> 08:29:45,020
Holy cow, that one was crazy.

8052
08:29:45,580 --> 08:29:47,940
Oh my god, that one was so crazy!

8053
08:29:50,600 --> 08:29:51,400
Yes!

8054
08:29:51,880 --> 08:29:52,960
That felt good.

8055
08:29:53,540 --> 08:29:54,860
That felt so good.

8056
08:29:55,880 --> 08:29:56,640
Oh no!

8057
08:29:57,300 --> 08:29:58,580
Okay, we need higher level.

8058
08:30:01,560 --> 08:30:01,780
Yeah!

8059
08:30:02,800 --> 08:30:04,660
That's the power of love.

8060
08:30:05,160 --> 08:30:05,380
What?

8061
08:30:05,820 --> 08:30:06,520
Yeah.

8062
08:30:06,860 --> 08:30:08,120
The power of love.

8063
08:30:08,800 --> 08:30:10,260
Do you believe?

8064
08:30:10,840 --> 08:30:11,600
Do you believe?

8065
08:30:12,260 --> 08:30:15,420
In the power of love?

8066
08:30:15,920 --> 08:30:17,520
Do you believe?

8067
08:30:20,060 --> 08:30:20,500
Huey!

8068
08:30:20,740 --> 08:30:21,880
No, Huey!

8069
08:30:36,700 --> 08:30:37,660
No, that's chat.

8070
08:30:37,720 --> 08:30:38,060
There we go.

8071
08:30:38,260 --> 08:30:38,420
Okay.

8072
08:30:40,000 --> 08:30:43,280
Oh, I was looking for box and I completely forgot what I was looking for.

8073
08:30:51,860 --> 08:30:52,740
Huey Lewis.

8074
08:30:54,300 --> 08:30:55,700
I don't get that one either.

8075
08:30:57,300 --> 08:30:57,740
Huey...

8076
08:30:58,980 --> 08:30:59,420
Huey...

8077
08:30:59,420 --> 08:31:01,500
I know you guys are sending bait names.

8078
08:31:02,140 --> 08:31:03,340
Huey Lewis?

8079
08:31:03,740 --> 08:31:04,580
I don't get it.

8080
08:31:05,200 --> 08:31:05,960
Oh, it's a band.

8081
08:31:07,560 --> 08:31:11,270
Back to the future.

8082
08:31:13,890 --> 08:31:15,230
It's actually a singer.

8083
08:31:16,790 --> 08:31:18,950
I don't trust anybody anymore.

8084
08:31:22,150 --> 08:31:24,650
I love you too.

8085
08:31:26,150 --> 08:31:27,990
Oh, I think I hear it.

8086
08:31:28,290 --> 08:31:29,370
I hear it, I hear it.

8087
08:31:30,170 --> 08:31:31,150
That's silly.

8088
08:31:35,250 --> 08:31:36,530
Don't come here.

8089
08:31:42,370 --> 08:31:43,790
Rude, rude, rude, rude.

8090
08:31:48,450 --> 08:31:49,650
Don't turn around.

8091
08:31:52,030 --> 08:31:53,230
What is he doing there?

8092
08:31:54,170 --> 08:31:55,470
He's like shrugging?

8093
08:31:57,390 --> 08:31:59,910
Huey Lewis sang the power of love.

8094
08:31:59,910 --> 08:32:03,350
Oh, I was singing the one from... What's it called?

8095
08:32:04,530 --> 08:32:07,930
From the Sailor Moon movie.

8096
08:32:10,430 --> 08:32:11,630
That's the one I was singing.

8097
08:32:14,310 --> 08:32:16,490
Okay, so now we can go to the left.

8098
08:32:19,840 --> 08:32:22,920
I don't think we got the one that disabled from the right.

8099
08:32:26,580 --> 08:32:28,240
Please, there we go.

8100
08:32:29,780 --> 08:32:31,320
Sailor Moon R, yeah!

8101
08:32:32,280 --> 08:32:33,880
I love that song.

8102
08:32:35,760 --> 08:32:42,540
Do you believe, do you believe in the power of love?

8103
08:32:45,120 --> 08:32:47,220
I love you is the superior goddom.

8104
08:32:47,480 --> 08:32:48,640
That one is so wholesome.

8105
08:32:50,120 --> 08:32:51,460
That one is pretty cute.

8106
08:32:51,640 --> 08:32:51,980
I'll end it.

8107
08:32:59,930 --> 08:33:01,630
I didn't get this one.

8108
08:33:01,630 --> 08:33:04,670
I have to go to the other side.

8109
08:33:13,930 --> 08:33:16,950
I thought that was the one I just blew up.

8110
08:33:40,400 --> 08:33:44,280
I go from the elevator, maybe that's the end, right?

8111
08:33:44,640 --> 08:33:44,980
Probably.

8112
08:33:53,600 --> 08:33:55,360
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

8113
08:33:56,740 --> 08:34:00,240
Okay, this is the one I fixed.

8114
08:34:01,120 --> 08:34:02,080
What's down here?

8115
08:34:03,340 --> 08:34:04,100
Oh, duh.

8116
08:34:05,820 --> 08:34:07,040
What's down here?

8117
08:34:07,340 --> 08:34:10,860
The place that I just came from and shot my missiles from.

8118
08:34:11,880 --> 08:34:13,220
Oh, no pot item.

8119
08:34:13,880 --> 08:34:14,400
Chaff grenade.

8120
08:34:16,520 --> 08:34:17,020
Health!

8121
08:34:23,380 --> 08:34:24,500
That's awkward.

8122
08:34:38,240 --> 08:34:39,780
Okay, from here.

8123
08:34:40,900 --> 08:34:41,620
Weapon.

8124
08:34:43,860 --> 08:34:44,560
Nikita.

8125
08:34:46,380 --> 08:34:49,840
Oh, Nikita, Nikita, Nikita, Nikita.

8126
08:34:52,120 --> 08:34:54,140
Wait, how am I supposed to get this one?

8127
08:34:54,760 --> 08:34:55,760
Wait, oh gosh.

8128
08:34:56,500 --> 08:34:57,960
I still don't know how.

8129
08:35:02,530 --> 08:35:08,610
Maybe this is actually a wall that I explode.

8130
08:35:12,470 --> 08:35:13,870
Weapon.

8131
08:35:18,150 --> 08:35:19,270
C4.

8132
08:35:24,900 --> 08:35:26,300
Yay!

8133
08:35:26,600 --> 08:35:26,740
Okay.

8134
08:35:28,640 --> 08:35:30,540
Thank goodness.

8135
08:35:34,450 --> 08:35:35,770
ID card 5!

8136
08:35:36,150 --> 08:35:36,630
Nice.

8137
08:35:38,630 --> 08:35:39,910
Can I punch it to death?

8138
08:35:45,270 --> 08:35:46,850
Okay, Nikita again.

8139
08:35:47,650 --> 08:35:49,910
Since apparently that's the only way you can destroy these things.

8140
08:35:51,290 --> 08:35:52,190
It's so silly.

8141
08:35:52,430 --> 08:35:53,570
I don't know where is it there.

8142
08:35:56,950 --> 08:35:57,430
Yay!

8143
08:36:01,350 --> 08:36:01,830
Okay.

8144
08:36:05,510 --> 08:36:07,510
How did I get to that elevator?

8145
08:36:07,770 --> 08:36:08,450
Oh, I remember.

8146
08:36:09,730 --> 08:36:10,290
Wait.

8147
08:36:13,330 --> 08:36:14,610
Was it down here?

8148
08:36:19,050 --> 08:36:20,130
I can't remember.

8149
08:36:34,170 --> 08:36:35,850
Yeah, I think I remember.

8150
08:36:36,670 --> 08:36:38,090
Yes, yes, I remember, I remember.

8151
08:36:43,370 --> 08:36:45,710
Okay, so I go through here.

8152
08:36:46,650 --> 08:36:47,850
Don't get caught.

8153
08:36:47,850 --> 08:36:50,110
Don't get caught.

8154
08:36:50,710 --> 08:36:52,890
And we go back down.

8155
08:36:53,610 --> 08:36:55,410
Oh, I'm going to grab more Nikita missiles while we are here.

8156
08:36:56,170 --> 08:36:57,210
Do you remember?

8157
08:36:59,590 --> 08:37:01,850
That's what first night of September.

8158
08:37:07,920 --> 08:37:09,980
Stop the immediate...

8159
08:37:11,820 --> 08:37:13,300
I am going the right way, right guys?

8160
08:37:13,380 --> 08:37:14,020
And then they are here.

8161
08:37:18,540 --> 08:37:20,380
And then I punch this guy out.

8162
08:37:21,640 --> 08:37:22,820
And then he falls asleep.

8163
08:37:25,220 --> 08:37:26,640
And then I punch this guy out.

8164
08:37:27,660 --> 08:37:28,360
Oh my god.

8165
08:37:28,680 --> 08:37:29,300
Oh my god.

8166
08:37:30,060 --> 08:37:31,220
And then he falls asleep.

8167
08:37:33,800 --> 08:37:34,240
And

8168
08:37:40,120 --> 08:37:40,560
then...

8169
08:37:40,560 --> 08:37:41,960
Guys, I don't remember.

8170
08:37:51,820 --> 08:37:53,160
Guys, I think I don't remember.

8171
08:37:54,360 --> 08:37:54,700
First

8172
08:38:01,440 --> 08:38:02,980
night I was just jorking it.

8173
08:38:03,400 --> 08:38:03,580
Sorry.

8174
08:38:03,580 --> 08:38:04,220
Wait, no.

8175
08:38:04,700 --> 08:38:10,360
I'm sorry.

8176
08:38:11,280 --> 08:38:12,160
I

8177
08:38:33,210 --> 08:38:34,470
didn't mean to.

8178
08:38:34,850 --> 08:38:35,290
No.

8179
08:38:36,270 --> 08:38:38,510
I didn't mean...

8180
08:38:40,070 --> 08:38:41,990
I didn't mean to.

8181
08:38:43,290 --> 08:38:44,790
I didn't mean...

8182
08:38:44,790 --> 08:38:47,010
I meant to say I was joking.

8183
08:38:49,010 --> 08:38:49,890
Oh

8184
08:39:05,080 --> 08:39:06,960
no, please don't clip that.

8185
08:39:08,620 --> 08:39:09,500
Oh

8186
08:39:19,120 --> 08:39:19,800
god, okay.

8187
08:39:27,860 --> 08:39:29,240
Oh gosh.

8188
08:39:29,660 --> 08:39:30,460
It's okay, we don't care.

8189
08:39:32,560 --> 08:39:35,520
I was jorking it for after stream.

8190
08:39:35,920 --> 08:39:36,680
No.

8191
08:39:38,020 --> 08:39:39,540
More than jorking it.

8192
08:39:39,960 --> 08:39:40,260
No.

8193
08:39:41,120 --> 08:39:43,120
You know how you are like, I'm joshing.

8194
08:39:44,360 --> 08:39:46,260
It just slipped out.

8195
08:39:48,320 --> 08:39:50,260
It just came out.

8196
08:39:52,800 --> 08:39:55,040
I didn't mean to.

8197
08:39:57,360 --> 08:39:59,240
I didn't mean to.

8198
08:40:00,020 --> 08:40:00,940
B43!

8199
08:40:02,620 --> 08:40:09,560
Oh my god, B45, 6, 7, 8, 9, 50!

8200
08:40:13,520 --> 08:40:15,000
Please new soundtrack.

8201
08:40:17,640 --> 08:40:18,360
Who's that?

8202
08:40:22,600 --> 08:40:24,280
Wait, am I supposed to pay attention?

8203
08:40:24,680 --> 08:40:25,040
Oh no.

8204
08:40:27,940 --> 08:40:28,540
Wait.

8205
08:40:29,300 --> 08:40:30,720
There's mines here, aren't there?

8206
08:40:30,820 --> 08:40:32,440
Oh god, wait, oh no.

8207
08:40:33,240 --> 08:40:33,880
Okay, hold on.

8208
08:40:51,870 --> 08:40:53,070
Holy moly!

8209
08:40:55,290 --> 08:40:56,530
There's so many!

8210
08:41:00,270 --> 08:41:01,110
It's okay.

8211
08:41:02,030 --> 08:41:03,430
I can lay down.

8212
08:41:07,930 --> 08:41:09,310
It's okay.

8213
08:41:10,490 --> 08:41:11,910
I can lay down.

8214
08:41:13,810 --> 08:41:14,850
C4!

8215
08:41:27,850 --> 08:41:29,370
Sleep guard.

8216
08:41:31,410 --> 08:41:32,450
I

8217
08:41:42,840 --> 08:41:47,140
think if I just punch him, he'll call me.

8218
08:41:51,130 --> 08:41:52,810
True, let's call her.

8219
08:41:56,740 --> 08:41:58,040
Need anything?

8220
08:42:01,330 --> 08:42:06,430
Francis Bacon said that revenge is a kind of wild justice.

8221
08:42:07,570 --> 08:42:09,990
But revenge isn't very productive.

8222
08:42:11,190 --> 08:42:12,250
Is it, Snake?

8223
08:42:13,210 --> 08:42:13,730
Wow.

8224
08:42:20,000 --> 08:42:22,220
The door doesn't open for me.

8225
08:42:24,280 --> 08:42:26,140
So I'm wondering if I must knock.

8226
08:42:40,280 --> 08:42:41,840
Oh, the body armor.

8227
08:42:42,280 --> 08:42:44,380
I think you're right.

8228
08:42:45,020 --> 08:42:46,180
I think you're right.

8229
08:42:46,300 --> 08:42:46,880
I think that's why.

8230
08:43:04,980 --> 08:43:06,560
Oh, this is so...

8231
08:43:08,820 --> 08:43:09,300
No!

8232
08:43:14,840 --> 08:43:15,320
Alright.

8233
08:43:15,980 --> 08:43:17,680
Thermal goggles, ahoy!

8234
08:43:20,260 --> 08:43:22,960
Hopefully I can go up and avoid the camera.

8235
08:43:26,000 --> 08:43:27,740
Hopefully this is a viable option.

8236
08:43:27,880 --> 08:43:28,360
8 hours?

8237
08:43:28,500 --> 08:43:29,960
Hell yeah, dude, so cool seeing you play.

8238
08:43:29,960 --> 08:43:31,560
Thanks, Endwatcher!

8239
08:43:31,620 --> 08:43:32,280
Thank you.

8240
08:43:32,400 --> 08:43:33,120
Thanks for the super chat.

8241
08:43:40,800 --> 08:43:41,600
And change.

8242
08:43:41,980 --> 08:43:42,800
I know, I saw this.

8243
08:43:42,860 --> 08:43:43,240
Oh, there we go.

8244
08:43:46,000 --> 08:43:47,800
But is there anything to collect in here?

8245
08:43:50,360 --> 08:43:51,160
Maybe not.

8246
08:43:53,700 --> 08:43:54,420
Maybe not.

8247
08:43:54,520 --> 08:43:55,080
Maybe it's fine.

8248
08:44:02,790 --> 08:44:03,790
Wait, what do you mean, Beep Beep?

8249
08:44:04,630 --> 08:44:05,610
Wait, what do you mean, Beep Beep?

8250
08:44:06,450 --> 08:44:07,570
What do you mean, Beep Beep?

8251
08:44:09,090 --> 08:44:10,130
What do you mean, Beep Beep?

8252
08:44:13,550 --> 08:44:14,510
No R-Style!

8253
08:44:14,570 --> 08:44:15,650
Thank you.

8254
08:44:16,370 --> 08:44:17,090
Level 6?

8255
08:44:17,510 --> 08:44:18,810
Where is level 6 at?

8256
08:44:21,770 --> 08:44:23,590
Why can't they write the numbers on them?

8257
08:44:31,990 --> 08:44:32,710
I see.

8258
08:44:33,730 --> 08:44:34,350
I see.

8259
08:44:41,330 --> 08:44:42,990
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

8260
08:44:43,210 --> 08:44:43,690
Oh my god.

8261
08:44:46,310 --> 08:44:47,270
Oh gosh.

8262
08:44:49,110 --> 08:44:50,150
Is it coming back?

8263
08:44:50,370 --> 08:44:50,910
Yes, OK.

8264
08:44:52,010 --> 08:44:55,990
Sorry, I was standing right in the line of...

8265
08:44:56,910 --> 08:44:58,830
Oh my god, I almost about died.

8266
08:45:02,330 --> 08:45:04,010
That was so close, huh?

8267
08:45:06,670 --> 08:45:09,490
That was pretty damn close.

8268
08:45:12,170 --> 08:45:14,050
Oh god, I'm glad I caught it though.

8269
08:45:26,840 --> 08:45:30,220
I'm kind of glad that they make getting the boxes a game mechanic.

8270
08:45:30,940 --> 08:45:34,140
Like, you know, you wouldn't have been able to get through that one part without them.

8271
08:45:34,600 --> 08:45:38,580
So it does make sure that you actually get the boxes and all.

8272
08:45:39,500 --> 08:45:40,520
It's kind of smart.

8273
08:45:51,730 --> 08:45:53,250
Beep Beep Beep.

8274
08:45:53,570 --> 08:45:55,150
Oh, when is it over?

8275
08:46:31,240 --> 08:46:32,240
You bastard!

8276
08:46:32,900 --> 08:46:33,540
You bastard!

8277
08:46:34,220 --> 08:46:35,200
I wish I could dodge roll.

8278
08:46:36,020 --> 08:46:37,060
Wait, what is this?

8279
08:46:37,440 --> 08:46:38,000
Is this a door?

8280
08:46:38,460 --> 08:46:38,660
Open.

8281
08:46:38,900 --> 08:46:39,420
Open sesame.

8282
08:46:39,860 --> 08:46:40,200
Open sesame.

8283
08:46:43,100 --> 08:46:45,060
I can't tell if this is a door or not.

8284
08:46:48,160 --> 08:46:49,080
Just run!

8285
08:46:50,360 --> 08:46:51,340
Just run!

8286
08:46:52,540 --> 08:46:52,920
It

8287
08:46:56,500 --> 08:46:57,180
matters!

8288
08:46:58,740 --> 08:46:59,300
No!

8289
08:47:00,080 --> 08:47:01,420
Dodge roll, snake!

8290
08:47:01,420 --> 08:47:02,200
Oh my gosh.

8291
08:47:02,340 --> 08:47:02,740
Snake, get up!

8292
08:47:03,520 --> 08:47:04,500
Snake, take the body armor.

8293
08:47:05,760 --> 08:47:06,720
Take your body armor.

8294
08:47:07,160 --> 08:47:08,240
Take your body armor, snake.

8295
08:47:12,910 --> 08:47:13,910
We made it.

8296
08:47:16,150 --> 08:47:16,550
Gun?

8297
08:47:16,730 --> 08:47:17,590
Then I have to aim.

8298
08:47:17,730 --> 08:47:20,690
It takes too much time to shoot.

8299
08:47:21,630 --> 08:47:22,850
It takes too much time.

8300
08:47:25,210 --> 08:47:25,930
Night vision.

8301
08:47:34,750 --> 08:47:37,770
Please pick a different soundtrack.

8302
08:47:40,010 --> 08:47:42,670
OK, back to thermal.

8303
08:47:47,130 --> 08:47:47,650
Boom!

8304
08:47:48,190 --> 08:47:48,650
Switch!

8305
08:47:49,290 --> 08:47:49,950
Switch!

8306
08:47:51,510 --> 08:47:53,550
OK, and switch!

8307
08:47:54,330 --> 08:47:54,710
Switch!

8308
08:47:55,750 --> 08:47:55,750
Switch!

8309
08:47:55,990 --> 08:47:56,650
Switch!

8310
08:47:56,990 --> 08:47:57,450
Switch!

8311
08:47:57,450 --> 08:47:58,350
Switch!

8312
08:47:58,890 --> 08:47:59,610
Switch!

8313
08:47:59,750 --> 08:48:00,750
Switch, go away.

8314
08:48:00,990 --> 08:48:01,490
Go away.

8315
08:48:02,230 --> 08:48:02,930
Disperse.

8316
08:48:03,250 --> 08:48:03,570
Leave.

8317
08:48:03,950 --> 08:48:04,350
Vanish.

8318
08:48:07,230 --> 08:48:08,410
Oh my god.

8319
08:48:08,570 --> 08:48:09,510
I thought that one changed.

8320
08:48:11,110 --> 08:48:13,590
That was so close.

8321
08:48:14,410 --> 08:48:14,810
Please!

8322
08:48:15,010 --> 08:48:15,370
Switch!

8323
08:48:15,670 --> 08:48:16,050
Vanish!

8324
08:48:16,410 --> 08:48:16,930
Disappear!

8325
08:48:17,830 --> 08:48:18,550
Leave!

8326
08:48:21,750 --> 08:48:25,470
Why is it everyone that I go up to doesn't disappear?

8327
08:48:25,470 --> 08:48:28,370
I saw you disappear before!

8328
08:48:28,950 --> 08:48:30,750
Why is it happening to me?

8329
08:48:30,890 --> 08:48:31,390
See?

8330
08:48:31,750 --> 08:48:33,450
I knew it.

8331
08:48:35,130 --> 08:48:38,790
Why is this part blown up?

8332
08:48:40,790 --> 08:48:41,130
OK.

8333
08:48:43,470 --> 08:48:44,470
Golly!

8334
08:48:50,390 --> 08:48:51,090
Hide up?

8335
08:48:51,690 --> 08:48:51,870
Wait.

8336
08:48:52,550 --> 08:48:53,190
Is it?

8337
08:48:53,330 --> 08:48:54,390
Are we able to see in here now?

8338
08:48:54,650 --> 08:48:54,890
Nope.

8339
08:48:58,770 --> 08:49:00,070
Is this a door?

8340
08:49:01,530 --> 08:49:02,610
I don't know if this is a door.

8341
08:49:17,520 --> 08:49:18,920
Is that it right there?

8342
08:49:25,740 --> 08:49:27,860
I'm actually gonna hear this in my nightmares.

8343
08:49:30,580 --> 08:49:31,800
This damn song.

8344
08:49:53,520 --> 08:49:54,820
What the hell was that?

8345
08:49:55,160 --> 08:49:56,660
Were you threatening me?

8346
08:49:57,200 --> 08:49:59,620
Was that a threat?

8347
08:50:00,020 --> 08:50:01,100
What was that?

8348
08:50:01,360 --> 08:50:02,580
I was like, don't do it.

8349
08:50:03,540 --> 08:50:04,800
What the heck?

8350
08:50:12,260 --> 08:50:13,460
Threatening me.

8351
08:50:18,480 --> 08:50:20,040
Wait, let me...

8352
08:50:22,380 --> 08:50:24,040
Did it actually...

8353
08:50:25,220 --> 08:50:25,520
No.

8354
08:50:25,760 --> 08:50:26,020
OK.

8355
08:50:30,980 --> 08:50:32,860
How do I get through this?

8356
08:50:35,240 --> 08:50:37,060
Is this not a door?

8357
08:50:47,280 --> 08:50:49,680
Switching between this and this game seems annoying.

8358
08:50:50,820 --> 08:50:52,700
Yeah, it's not ideal.

8359
08:50:54,020 --> 08:50:54,780
C4 the wall?

8360
08:50:54,880 --> 08:50:55,180
OK.

8361
08:50:55,180 --> 08:50:55,240
OK.

8362
08:51:01,980 --> 08:51:07,500
I wish they gave you more of an indication when you got a C4 or something.

8363
08:51:33,430 --> 08:51:34,410
Everything is bad.

8364
08:51:35,710 --> 08:51:37,070
Everything is not good.

8365
08:51:37,930 --> 08:51:39,770
How do I get in there?

8366
08:51:47,240 --> 08:51:49,240
Do I crawl under the desk?

8367
08:51:49,340 --> 08:51:49,640
I wonder.

8368
08:51:54,270 --> 08:51:55,470
I still see them.

8369
08:51:56,910 --> 08:51:57,890
Wandering around.

8370
08:51:58,510 --> 08:51:59,690
Leave me alone.

8371
08:51:59,870 --> 08:52:00,230
Oh my god.

8372
08:52:03,010 --> 08:52:03,710
Let's see.

8373
08:52:03,970 --> 08:52:04,530
Just a box.

8374
08:52:05,050 --> 08:52:05,930
Just a box.

8375
08:52:06,370 --> 08:52:07,430
Just a box.

8376
08:52:07,910 --> 08:52:09,290
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

8377
08:52:10,130 --> 08:52:11,770
Just a box.

8378
08:52:14,800 --> 08:52:16,980
Oh my god, I was about to move.

8379
08:52:17,720 --> 08:52:19,160
You just checked this room!

8380
08:52:20,180 --> 08:52:20,700
Sir!

8381
08:52:23,440 --> 08:52:24,620
You're too paranoid.

8382
08:52:27,000 --> 08:52:28,520
Oh my god, he's back.

8383
08:52:28,520 --> 08:52:30,500
Leave me alone!

8384
08:52:31,160 --> 08:52:32,960
Leave me alone, please!

8385
08:52:41,390 --> 08:52:42,970
Maybe that's his route.

8386
08:52:44,230 --> 08:52:45,550
Maybe that's his route.

8387
08:52:48,010 --> 08:52:50,090
I'm gonna use one of these.

8388
08:53:01,280 --> 08:53:02,140
No!

8389
08:53:05,940 --> 08:53:08,460
Where is the damn car key?

8390
08:53:15,590 --> 08:53:19,810
Well, good to know though that I can crawl under this at least.

8391
08:53:31,230 --> 08:53:32,370
Alright, C4.

8392
08:53:38,220 --> 08:53:38,600
No!

8393
08:53:40,660 --> 08:53:41,360
C4!

8394
08:53:42,760 --> 08:53:43,460
No!

8395
08:53:55,490 --> 08:53:56,810
What's the point?

8396
08:53:57,350 --> 08:53:57,710
Down?

8397
08:54:04,110 --> 08:54:05,510
I see another electric flurry.

8398
08:54:05,830 --> 08:54:06,690
Okay, thanks mod!

8399
08:54:06,690 --> 08:54:11,070
Bomb the left side.

8400
08:54:12,310 --> 08:54:12,990
This?

8401
08:54:13,270 --> 08:54:14,130
No, I don't need to bomb.

8402
08:54:14,250 --> 08:54:14,810
Wait, maybe...

8403
08:54:16,030 --> 08:54:16,610
Here?

8404
08:54:29,760 --> 08:54:30,440
What?

8405
08:54:41,040 --> 08:54:42,120
I don't understand.

8406
08:54:45,740 --> 08:54:47,620
I don't understand at all.

8407
08:54:51,650 --> 08:54:53,170
The wall above it.

8408
08:54:53,250 --> 08:54:53,810
This one?

8409
08:54:55,450 --> 08:54:56,810
Oh my god, snake please.

8410
08:54:57,790 --> 08:55:00,890
It only let's me put it in the middle.

8411
08:55:14,830 --> 08:55:16,590
I'm out of...

8412
08:55:18,850 --> 08:55:20,010
This one?

8413
08:55:21,830 --> 08:55:23,990
Oh my god.

8414
08:55:25,590 --> 08:55:26,070
No...

8415
08:55:49,470 --> 08:55:52,270
I don't even know if they're here or not.

8416
08:55:55,930 --> 08:55:56,890
So...

8417
08:55:56,890 --> 08:55:58,210
Stupid.

8418
08:55:59,030 --> 08:56:00,650
So stupid.

8419
08:56:02,210 --> 08:56:03,410
What the hell is the point of this?

8420
08:56:05,250 --> 08:56:07,530
Let's change my weapon to a gun.

8421
08:56:08,390 --> 08:56:09,790
I'm gonna murder people now.

8422
08:56:10,230 --> 08:56:11,330
I'm ready to kill.

8423
08:56:30,420 --> 08:56:34,440
Is it dark in here or can I put on my...

8424
08:56:36,000 --> 08:56:36,820
Leave me alone.

8425
08:56:37,220 --> 08:56:37,560
Thank you.

8426
08:56:37,740 --> 08:56:38,200
Leave me alone.

8427
08:56:38,620 --> 08:56:39,160
Thank you.

8428
08:56:39,480 --> 08:56:39,940
Leave me alone.

8429
08:56:40,220 --> 08:56:41,540
Oh my gosh, please let me leave.

8430
08:56:41,780 --> 08:56:42,120
Thank you.

8431
08:56:42,520 --> 08:56:43,080
Okay, I'm leaving.

8432
08:56:43,740 --> 08:56:44,780
Don't worry about me.

8433
08:56:46,780 --> 08:56:47,220
Oh...

8434
08:57:01,550 --> 08:57:03,310
Do I blow up this one?

8435
08:57:04,090 --> 08:57:04,910
This is horrible.

8436
08:57:08,290 --> 08:57:10,410
The game was so fine.

8437
08:57:12,330 --> 08:57:14,170
Until it became so tedious.

8438
08:57:22,760 --> 08:57:24,880
Oh wait, I don't know why I took off my night vision.

8439
08:57:24,940 --> 08:57:25,400
I'm an idiot.

8440
08:57:27,360 --> 08:57:27,640
Oh...

8441
08:57:55,930 --> 08:57:57,150
This one?

8442
08:57:58,150 --> 08:57:58,870
Please.

8443
08:58:00,910 --> 08:58:02,350
Oh my...

8444
08:58:02,350 --> 08:58:03,430
I'm gonna die here.

8445
08:58:04,230 --> 08:58:05,690
I'm gonna die here, you guys.

8446
08:58:05,870 --> 08:58:07,650
I don't know where to go.

8447
08:58:07,890 --> 08:58:08,810
I have nothing.

8448
08:58:09,170 --> 08:58:11,110
I don't know.

8449
08:58:12,310 --> 08:58:13,510
I don't know.

8450
08:58:34,830 --> 08:58:36,150
Oh fuck!

8451
08:58:39,300 --> 08:58:40,940
Please don't stay here.

8452
08:58:42,980 --> 08:58:43,580
Please.

8453
08:58:44,280 --> 08:58:45,760
Give me a chance.

8454
08:58:47,300 --> 08:58:49,640
He like ran away with his arms up.

8455
08:58:51,660 --> 08:58:53,460
Oh god, I'm so tired.

8456
08:59:04,470 --> 08:59:05,650
There it is.

8457
08:59:06,950 --> 08:59:08,990
Where is the panel at though?

8458
08:59:10,710 --> 08:59:12,090
Do these ones have guns?

8459
08:59:13,230 --> 08:59:14,070
Oh, they don't.

8460
08:59:18,510 --> 08:59:20,210
Why do you do this to me?

8461
08:59:20,210 --> 08:59:22,430
How do I get back?

8462
08:59:33,650 --> 08:59:36,990
Why is this a mechanic that every time you... Oh my god!

8463
08:59:37,230 --> 08:59:39,510
Every time you fire anything...

8464
08:59:40,190 --> 08:59:42,030
I'm just playing the fucking game.

8465
08:59:42,350 --> 08:59:44,690
And they're just like, yeah, by the way, that's gonna set off an alarm.

8466
08:59:45,430 --> 08:59:46,330
Hope you don't mind.

8467
08:59:47,230 --> 08:59:49,970
That's gonna really ruin your plans here, buddy.

8468
08:59:52,350 --> 08:59:53,310
Oh gosh.

8469
08:59:53,430 --> 08:59:53,970
Oh, we're here.

8470
08:59:54,110 --> 08:59:54,430
We're here.

8471
08:59:54,430 --> 08:59:55,090
Okay.

8472
08:59:56,470 --> 08:59:56,970
Wait.

8473
08:59:58,390 --> 09:00:00,730
Isn't this where I came from?

8474
09:00:01,950 --> 09:00:02,510
No.

8475
09:00:06,800 --> 09:00:07,280
What do you mean?

8476
09:00:07,720 --> 09:00:07,920
No?

8477
09:00:08,300 --> 09:00:09,160
What do you mean no?

8478
09:00:09,520 --> 09:00:09,800
Okay.

8479
09:00:10,260 --> 09:00:11,140
What do you mean by that?

8480
09:00:11,820 --> 09:00:13,460
Why can't you give me more rations, please?

8481
09:00:16,080 --> 09:00:17,560
Oh, now it's fine?

8482
09:00:21,130 --> 09:00:24,170
Isn't this where I came from though?

8483
09:00:24,570 --> 09:00:25,410
Where am I going?

8484
09:00:31,480 --> 09:00:32,040
Thermal.

8485
09:00:32,980 --> 09:00:35,080
Isn't this where the camera is?

8486
09:00:35,340 --> 09:00:36,760
Where was I trying to go?

8487
09:00:43,380 --> 09:00:45,000
Everything is blurred.

8488
09:00:48,240 --> 09:00:49,680
The far left door.

8489
09:00:56,160 --> 09:00:56,580
Okay.

8490
09:00:57,340 --> 09:00:58,240
The one in here?

8491
09:01:13,800 --> 09:01:15,500
It's meant to need a small break.

8492
09:01:15,640 --> 09:01:17,560
No, it's just...

8493
09:01:17,560 --> 09:01:19,940
These levels have gotten so tedious.

8494
09:01:21,580 --> 09:01:25,840
Like, have content, have lots of stuff for your game, but like...

8495
09:01:25,840 --> 09:01:29,180
You gotta give people a little bit of something.

8496
09:01:29,740 --> 09:01:35,520
Like, there has to be, like, if you knock on the wall, you'll know that you can blow it up.

8497
09:01:35,640 --> 09:01:36,740
But that doesn't work.

8498
09:01:37,140 --> 09:01:39,440
You have to, like, give some people...

8499
09:01:39,440 --> 09:01:43,740
You can't just have people blindly, like, blowing up everything.

8500
09:01:43,940 --> 09:01:44,940
It just doesn't...

8501
09:01:45,820 --> 09:01:46,740
It just...

8502
09:01:46,740 --> 09:01:49,060
That's not how this should be.

8503
09:01:49,060 --> 09:01:50,060
Okay.

8504
09:01:51,870 --> 09:01:53,160
It was this room, right?

8505
09:02:07,500 --> 09:02:09,220
Where does this guy stop at?

8506
09:02:11,740 --> 09:02:13,060
Right there, okay.

8507
09:02:22,700 --> 09:02:24,300
We don't worry about him.

8508
09:02:26,920 --> 09:02:27,820
Oh gosh.

8509
09:02:28,140 --> 09:02:30,180
We worry about...

8510
09:02:34,540 --> 09:02:35,860
There's more...

8511
09:02:35,860 --> 09:02:37,060
Ways...

8512
09:02:38,140 --> 09:02:38,660
Ways...

8513
09:02:39,960 --> 09:02:40,480
Let

8514
09:02:44,150 --> 09:02:44,790
me be free.

8515
09:02:45,490 --> 09:02:47,690
Let me be free, please.

8516
09:02:51,660 --> 09:02:52,180
Okay.

8517
09:02:53,720 --> 09:02:54,300
Oh my god.

8518
09:03:01,360 --> 09:03:01,880
Please.

8519
09:03:22,770 --> 09:03:24,290
No, no, no, no, no.

8520
09:03:24,430 --> 09:03:25,130
Don't do it.

8521
09:03:25,270 --> 09:03:26,110
Don't do it, mister.

8522
09:03:26,110 --> 09:03:27,290
Please, mister, mister.

8523
09:03:27,710 --> 09:03:29,230
Mister, mister, mister, mister.

8524
09:03:29,770 --> 09:03:30,130
No!

8525
09:03:34,620 --> 09:03:35,180
Please, mister.

8526
09:03:35,400 --> 09:03:36,160
Mister, please go.

8527
09:03:36,280 --> 09:03:36,600
Thank you.

8528
09:03:42,840 --> 09:03:43,360
Jesus!

8529
09:03:45,420 --> 09:03:46,480
Oh my god.

8530
09:03:48,300 --> 09:03:49,340
This guy...

8531
09:03:49,340 --> 09:03:49,820
He was like...

8532
09:03:49,820 --> 09:03:52,000
He was literally inching towards me.

8533
09:03:52,680 --> 09:03:54,100
Oh my god.

8534
09:04:00,260 --> 09:04:01,660
God damn it.

8535
09:04:01,940 --> 09:04:03,220
We're going more down?

8536
09:04:03,660 --> 09:04:04,560
Please, is this it?

8537
09:04:04,940 --> 09:04:05,540
Is this it?

8538
09:04:05,600 --> 09:04:06,240
Am I done?

8539
09:04:07,500 --> 09:04:08,020
Please.

8540
09:04:08,440 --> 09:04:09,920
Please let this be the end.

8541
09:04:10,560 --> 09:04:11,920
Please let me just fight Metal Gear.

8542
09:04:12,700 --> 09:04:14,700
Please let me just fight Metal Gear.

8543
09:04:22,930 --> 09:04:24,310
Here we go.

8544
09:04:25,210 --> 09:04:29,330
B74, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 80.

8545
09:04:29,590 --> 09:04:31,450
1, 2, 3, 4.

8546
09:04:31,510 --> 09:04:32,250
Oh my gosh, you guys.

8547
09:04:32,890 --> 09:04:33,850
We're going...

8548
09:04:33,850 --> 09:04:35,890
We're getting to Matara's age.

8549
09:04:42,510 --> 09:04:44,210
This place is huge.

8550
09:04:44,450 --> 09:04:44,910
No, right?

8551
09:04:45,470 --> 09:04:45,950
98!

8552
09:04:47,230 --> 09:04:48,210
Oh no, please.

8553
09:04:48,810 --> 09:04:49,130
End.

8554
09:04:49,490 --> 09:04:50,670
End this song!

8555
09:04:51,110 --> 09:04:52,890
This is me when this song starts playing again.

8556
09:05:00,010 --> 09:05:02,670
Mei Ling, put us out of our misery for 2 seconds, please.

8557
09:05:06,640 --> 09:05:07,900
You rang, Snake?

8558
09:05:08,060 --> 09:05:10,400
Oh, Mei Ling, your sweet, sweet voice.

8559
09:05:12,060 --> 09:05:16,840
I think I would be less mind-broken if the song wasn't just horrible in my ears.

8560
09:05:17,400 --> 09:05:20,240
Snake, according to Dr. Copel-Thorn...

8561
09:05:21,480 --> 09:05:25,180
I know, you can quote other people a lot.

8562
09:05:26,760 --> 09:05:29,100
Some money towards the therapy you may need after this.

8563
09:05:29,160 --> 09:05:29,680
Thank you.

8564
09:05:29,680 --> 09:05:29,740
No.

8565
09:05:33,680 --> 09:05:37,920
But don't you have anything to say for yourself?

8566
09:05:39,660 --> 09:05:40,540
For myself?

8567
09:05:43,240 --> 09:05:45,680
Yes, I'd like to hear your own words.

8568
09:05:47,340 --> 09:05:47,780
Okay.

8569
09:05:50,380 --> 09:05:50,820
Well...

8570
09:05:51,960 --> 09:05:52,820
I'm sorry.

8571
09:05:53,700 --> 09:05:55,100
I can't think of anything.

8572
09:05:55,220 --> 09:05:57,560
Yeah, she's not going to be able to think of anything on the spot, Snake.

8573
09:05:58,880 --> 09:06:05,760
Maybe I'm just an accumulation of facts and quotations.

8574
09:06:06,020 --> 09:06:08,140
Oh no, you're giving her a crisis, Snake.

8575
09:06:08,940 --> 09:06:10,020
Beanie, welcome to membership.

8576
09:06:10,220 --> 09:06:10,860
Thank you.

8577
09:06:12,180 --> 09:06:14,140
I have nothing of myself.

8578
09:06:16,160 --> 09:06:17,440
That's not true.

8579
09:06:19,120 --> 09:06:23,560
What you just said were your own feelings, right?

8580
09:06:24,400 --> 09:06:27,220
It's a lot better than being trapped.

8581
09:06:27,560 --> 09:06:28,800
In the past.

8582
09:06:29,300 --> 09:06:29,940
Like me.

8583
09:06:40,910 --> 09:06:42,530
There it is!

8584
09:06:44,790 --> 09:06:47,730
See, this music would have been great for just this room.

8585
09:06:55,370 --> 09:06:56,350
Elevator again?

8586
09:07:02,720 --> 09:07:04,620
How do we want to do this?

8587
09:07:08,200 --> 09:07:11,720
I wish these guys stayed asleep for longer.

8588
09:07:17,590 --> 09:07:18,350
Shove grenade.

8589
09:07:20,870 --> 09:07:21,390
Grenade.

8590
09:07:21,690 --> 09:07:22,130
Grenade.

8591
09:07:22,250 --> 09:07:22,450
Grenade.

8592
09:07:25,830 --> 09:07:26,350
Shoot.

8593
09:07:35,020 --> 09:07:35,540
No.

8594
09:07:35,720 --> 09:07:35,880
No.

8595
09:07:36,020 --> 09:07:36,180
No.

8596
09:07:36,300 --> 09:07:36,480
No.

8597
09:07:36,560 --> 09:07:36,700
No.

8598
09:07:37,000 --> 09:07:37,120
No.

8599
09:07:37,260 --> 09:07:37,260
No.

8600
09:07:37,400 --> 09:07:37,580
No.

8601
09:07:37,700 --> 09:07:37,960
No.

8602
09:07:38,360 --> 09:07:38,440
No.

8603
09:07:38,440 --> 09:07:38,620
No.

8604
09:07:38,620 --> 09:07:39,020
No.

8605
09:07:39,140 --> 09:07:39,140
No.

8606
09:07:39,200 --> 09:07:39,200
No.

8607
09:07:39,420 --> 09:07:39,760
No.

8608
09:07:43,820 --> 09:07:44,800
You will not!

8609
09:07:45,140 --> 09:07:45,860
You will not!

8610
09:07:45,860 --> 09:07:47,760
You guys ran in here way too fast.

8611
09:07:48,120 --> 09:07:48,500
I swear.

8612
09:07:49,340 --> 09:07:51,140
You will not do this to me.

8613
09:07:52,060 --> 09:07:52,540
Leave!

8614
09:07:53,340 --> 09:07:53,820
Leave!

8615
09:07:54,700 --> 09:07:55,180
Leave!

8616
09:08:00,280 --> 09:08:01,560
Where even were they?

8617
09:08:02,780 --> 09:08:03,640
Where did he go?

8618
09:08:03,960 --> 09:08:04,720
Are they gonna leave?

8619
09:08:07,800 --> 09:08:09,000
Ok, one guy left.

8620
09:08:09,660 --> 09:08:11,120
They're all doing their little rounds.

8621
09:08:11,780 --> 09:08:12,920
They're being good soldiers.

8622
09:08:13,140 --> 09:08:15,080
We can't blame them for being good soldiers.

8623
09:08:15,080 --> 09:08:20,820
Well, not good, but like proper soldiers, right?

8624
09:08:21,320 --> 09:08:24,720
They're just like, we gotta do our rounds and we gotta do them very thoroughly.

8625
09:08:25,540 --> 09:08:28,340
Except we can't look under desks because that's...

8626
09:08:28,340 --> 09:08:30,440
Ok, that guy is lazy as hell.

8627
09:08:30,820 --> 09:08:32,500
That guy is a slack...

8628
09:08:32,500 --> 09:08:38,440
Ok, it's just this one fanatic up here who's not leaving because he's crazy.

8629
09:08:40,500 --> 09:08:42,800
Oh, I think he's actually bugged.

8630
09:08:46,020 --> 09:08:46,780
Just run.

8631
09:08:48,820 --> 09:08:49,380
Nice.

8632
09:08:54,360 --> 09:08:55,300
What's in here?

8633
09:09:30,620 --> 09:09:33,040
We'll let him go to the other side of the room again.

8634
09:09:34,600 --> 09:09:37,020
Proper soldiers would have object permanence.

8635
09:09:37,420 --> 09:09:41,080
I'm meaning proper in that they're following protocol, you know?

8636
09:09:44,260 --> 09:09:46,180
They're following protocol.

8637
09:09:47,460 --> 09:09:50,320
Is all I'm trying to say.

8638
09:09:54,440 --> 09:09:55,820
Now, what do I do here?

8639
09:09:56,640 --> 09:09:57,300
Uh, colonel?

8640
09:09:58,580 --> 09:10:01,260
Colonel, save me from the madness music, please.

8641
09:10:04,100 --> 09:10:06,960
Didn't they say that Metal Gear was above ground?

8642
09:10:07,260 --> 09:10:09,200
We're in basement 98.

8643
09:10:09,600 --> 09:10:11,160
This does not look...

8644
09:10:11,160 --> 09:10:13,280
Snake, Metal Gear is down below.

8645
09:10:13,420 --> 09:10:14,300
Oh, now it's down below.

8646
09:10:14,540 --> 09:10:16,040
Make up your mind!

8647
09:10:18,640 --> 09:10:19,600
This is it.

8648
09:10:21,780 --> 09:10:22,820
There's the target.

8649
09:10:23,260 --> 09:10:24,100
Right there.

8650
09:10:26,220 --> 09:10:27,220
Stay focused.

8651
09:10:29,380 --> 09:10:30,680
What does that mean?

8652
09:10:31,220 --> 09:10:32,120
Let's talk to Weasel.

8653
09:10:32,180 --> 09:10:34,040
We haven't talked to this guy the entire time.

8654
09:10:35,100 --> 09:10:35,680
Hey, Weasel.

8655
09:10:36,760 --> 09:10:37,280
Weasel.

8656
09:10:38,120 --> 09:10:39,760
How'd your brother die?

8657
09:10:39,880 --> 09:10:40,360
Oh, damn.

8658
09:10:40,800 --> 09:10:43,360
I haven't talked to this guy the entire time.

8659
09:10:43,800 --> 09:10:45,360
And this is how we...

8660
09:10:46,040 --> 09:10:46,700
Okay.

8661
09:10:47,940 --> 09:10:48,880
I killed him.

8662
09:10:50,560 --> 09:10:51,740
McBride said so.

8663
09:10:52,040 --> 09:10:52,880
Don't you remember?

8664
09:10:54,980 --> 09:10:56,920
But that's not true, is it?

8665
09:10:58,140 --> 09:10:59,880
Why do you think that?

8666
09:11:01,340 --> 09:11:03,460
I just have a feeling.

8667
09:11:04,260 --> 09:11:05,590
That wasn't a quite...

8668
09:11:06,390 --> 09:11:08,190
That wasn't quite how it happened.

8669
09:11:09,070 --> 09:11:10,830
I feel like Snake is...

8670
09:11:11,290 --> 09:11:12,310
Relating with him.

8671
09:11:12,630 --> 09:11:13,930
You know, with like Gray Fox.

8672
09:11:15,810 --> 09:11:16,450
Frogbert?

8673
09:11:16,570 --> 09:11:16,890
No, no.

8674
09:11:16,990 --> 09:11:17,810
That is not my...

8675
09:11:17,810 --> 09:11:19,590
That is not Frogbert's voice.

8676
09:11:20,630 --> 09:11:22,870
This is Weasel's voice.

8677
09:11:23,310 --> 09:11:25,790
Yeah, Frogbert is Frogbert's voice.

8678
09:11:26,590 --> 09:11:27,510
They're completely different.

8679
09:11:28,990 --> 09:11:32,330
There's a patch of hell reserved just for killers.

8680
09:11:32,330 --> 09:11:38,010
Who turn against their own flesh and blood.

8681
09:11:41,650 --> 09:11:43,670
I know something about that.

8682
09:11:44,850 --> 09:11:47,730
Okay, that was a little far.

8683
09:11:47,790 --> 09:11:49,110
Now I'm getting it all mixed up.

8684
09:11:49,890 --> 09:11:53,130
There's no getting around you, huh?

8685
09:11:53,850 --> 09:11:55,650
My brother...

8686
09:11:55,650 --> 09:11:57,510
He was a dumb kid.

8687
09:11:58,670 --> 09:12:01,890
He didn't have the talent for it.

8688
09:12:02,330 --> 09:12:05,130
But he became a mercenary anyway.

8689
09:12:05,530 --> 09:12:06,370
Anyway.

8690
09:12:08,530 --> 09:12:10,570
Always copying me.

8691
09:12:11,890 --> 09:12:15,690
During this one conflict, I was hired by one side.

8692
09:12:16,830 --> 09:12:19,010
And he by the other side.

8693
09:12:24,030 --> 09:12:26,610
The side that was going to lose.

8694
09:12:28,230 --> 09:12:29,470
Just like I thought.

8695
09:12:29,470 --> 09:12:33,790
His side got pushed further into the corner.

8696
09:12:34,130 --> 09:12:34,930
Every day.

8697
09:12:35,350 --> 09:12:36,530
Good night boss, good luck with the ending.

8698
09:12:36,650 --> 09:12:37,250
Thank you!

8699
09:12:37,370 --> 09:12:39,310
I know some of you guys are staying up pretty late.

8700
09:12:39,810 --> 09:12:41,310
If you have to go to bed, no worries.

8701
09:12:43,690 --> 09:12:47,570
One day I was told that we were going in for the final kill.

8702
09:12:47,990 --> 09:12:50,510
With everything we had.

8703
09:12:50,810 --> 09:12:51,950
I thought he was going to say got.

8704
09:12:53,710 --> 09:12:55,030
I could have warned him.

8705
09:12:56,110 --> 09:12:57,090
But I didn't.

8706
09:12:58,090 --> 09:13:03,490
The next day, his entire force was wiped out.

8707
09:13:03,950 --> 09:13:05,770
And he was dead.

8708
09:13:07,630 --> 09:13:08,470
It was war.

8709
09:13:10,150 --> 09:13:13,090
Not something for you to...

8710
09:13:13,930 --> 09:13:15,210
Maybe that's true.

8711
09:13:16,230 --> 09:13:18,830
But I know he died blaming me.

8712
09:13:20,850 --> 09:13:22,830
When I found his body.

8713
09:13:22,830 --> 09:13:25,850
He had the lucky pendant.

8714
09:13:26,510 --> 09:13:27,690
I had given him.

8715
09:13:28,150 --> 09:13:29,730
Half bitten through.

8716
09:13:30,550 --> 09:13:32,290
Between his teeth.

8717
09:13:33,730 --> 09:13:35,470
V has come too.

8718
09:13:36,270 --> 09:13:38,610
Thank you for the five minutes.

8719
09:13:40,690 --> 09:13:42,830
The chain ripped to pieces.

8720
09:13:44,970 --> 09:13:46,810
That's pretty...

8721
09:13:46,810 --> 09:13:49,750
What am I supposed to do here now?

8722
09:13:50,570 --> 09:13:51,050
Hello!

8723
09:13:51,930 --> 09:13:53,550
Hello Metal Gear.

8724
09:13:54,070 --> 09:13:55,570
Maybe I go through here?

8725
09:14:00,180 --> 09:14:00,860
Take the elevator?

8726
09:14:01,040 --> 09:14:01,220
Yeah.

8727
09:14:05,300 --> 09:14:06,780
We are going more down!

8728
09:14:14,280 --> 09:14:15,060
Nine.

8729
09:14:19,530 --> 09:14:20,310
Seriously?

8730
09:14:25,010 --> 09:14:26,490
Actually messed up.

8731
09:14:34,690 --> 09:14:36,410
Please change the soundtrack!

8732
09:14:36,990 --> 09:14:37,430
You know what?

8733
09:14:39,370 --> 09:14:40,050
Oh wait.

8734
09:14:41,690 --> 09:14:44,250
I just realized I can't put on other music.

8735
09:14:44,410 --> 09:14:45,110
Wait, I can!

8736
09:14:45,230 --> 09:14:45,690
Hold on.

8737
09:14:46,830 --> 09:14:47,930
OK, we are going to put on this.

8738
09:14:50,950 --> 09:14:51,570
Oh my god!

8739
09:14:51,570 --> 09:14:52,110
He woke up!

8740
09:14:52,450 --> 09:14:54,640
Wake up!

8741
09:14:54,920 --> 09:14:55,420
Oh my god!

8742
09:14:55,640 --> 09:14:56,620
No, no, no, no, no!

8743
09:14:56,620 --> 09:14:57,800
Why did you wake up?

8744
09:14:58,100 --> 09:14:58,340
Hello?

8745
09:15:14,900 --> 09:15:16,380
OK, another elevator?

8746
09:15:16,560 --> 09:15:19,640
Who designed... Who is actually designing these places?

8747
09:15:20,040 --> 09:15:20,860
This is ridiculous.

8748
09:15:27,770 --> 09:15:29,170
I hope it's not too long.

8749
09:15:29,310 --> 09:15:30,530
Sorry, too loud.

8750
09:15:30,790 --> 09:15:31,090
Is it?

8751
09:15:32,150 --> 09:15:33,970
I think it's... Hold on.

8752
09:15:40,410 --> 09:15:41,110
It's OK?

8753
09:15:41,250 --> 09:15:41,610
OK, good.

8754
09:15:42,850 --> 09:15:45,250
Much better than...

8755
09:15:46,410 --> 09:15:48,510
Much better than the other music.

8756
09:15:58,730 --> 09:16:00,050
What's over here?

8757
09:16:01,950 --> 09:16:03,090
What's happening?

8758
09:16:09,140 --> 09:16:10,880
Maybe I should have music on.

8759
09:16:13,680 --> 09:16:14,580
Pause?

8760
09:16:34,370 --> 09:16:35,270
Geez.

8761
09:16:36,470 --> 09:16:37,910
Sorry guys.

8762
09:16:38,860 --> 09:16:42,390
Sorry, I didn't mean... I didn't mean for it to happen.

8763
09:16:43,590 --> 09:16:46,450
This is what we didn't hear, I think.

8764
09:16:50,420 --> 09:16:51,270
What is that?

8765
09:16:51,390 --> 09:16:52,970
Looks like...

8766
09:16:53,620 --> 09:16:53,950
Wait!

8767
09:16:54,390 --> 09:16:55,070
Oh my god!

8768
09:16:55,910 --> 09:16:56,570
It's...

8769
09:16:56,570 --> 09:16:58,330
Oh my god, it's the...

8770
09:16:58,330 --> 09:17:01,070
I recognize this room and...

8771
09:17:01,070 --> 09:17:02,050
Oh my god!

8772
09:17:02,350 --> 09:17:04,450
Wow, it's the destroyed Metal Gear!

8773
09:17:05,190 --> 09:17:06,350
No way!

8774
09:17:06,350 --> 09:17:06,630
No way!

8775
09:17:11,290 --> 09:17:12,790
That's so fun.

8776
09:17:13,870 --> 09:17:15,470
What does Campbell have to say about it?

8777
09:17:15,510 --> 09:17:16,010
Let's hear.

8778
09:17:18,210 --> 09:17:18,770
Campbell!

8779
09:17:42,880 --> 09:17:44,620
To an evil past.

8780
09:17:45,940 --> 09:17:49,000
It ends right here this time.

8781
09:17:49,100 --> 09:17:51,700
I wish... I wish that were real.

8782
09:17:52,160 --> 09:17:52,560
What?

8783
09:17:53,540 --> 09:17:55,620
Oh my gosh!

8784
09:17:56,100 --> 09:17:58,500
Wow, that's so cool!

8785
09:18:00,040 --> 09:18:01,920
That's so awesome!

8786
09:18:02,520 --> 09:18:03,420
Oh my god.

8787
09:18:04,740 --> 09:18:06,460
That's so cool.

8788
09:18:06,460 --> 09:18:06,780
That's so cool.

8789
09:18:10,260 --> 09:18:10,700
Wow!

8790
09:18:14,060 --> 09:18:14,500
Okay.

8791
09:18:15,600 --> 09:18:17,580
I'm gonna switch my body armor.

8792
09:18:17,740 --> 09:18:19,220
How much rations do I have?

8793
09:18:19,500 --> 09:18:20,660
I don't think a lot.

8794
09:18:20,820 --> 09:18:23,360
I think I'm just gonna have to be good at this fight, honestly.

8795
09:18:27,680 --> 09:18:28,760
We're at the base.

8796
09:18:37,690 --> 09:18:38,770
Do we have to save?

8797
09:18:38,870 --> 09:18:42,950
I guess I can, but I don't... I mean, if I die, I just press continue and it's fine.

8798
09:18:49,270 --> 09:18:50,230
What's up, Snake?

8799
09:18:51,210 --> 09:18:51,830
I'm saving.

8800
09:18:54,150 --> 09:18:55,650
The worst is not.

8801
09:18:56,190 --> 09:18:59,030
So long as we can say...

8802
09:18:59,030 --> 09:19:00,250
This is the worst.

8803
09:19:01,490 --> 09:19:02,370
William Shakespeare.

8804
09:19:02,830 --> 09:19:03,150
Again.

8805
09:19:04,370 --> 09:19:05,710
Don't give up.

8806
09:19:10,710 --> 09:19:12,830
The long road.

8807
09:19:19,770 --> 09:19:20,610
Suspicious.

8808
09:19:23,710 --> 09:19:24,530
Oh my god.

8809
09:19:25,090 --> 09:19:26,810
Think about the prize at the end.

8810
09:19:26,850 --> 09:19:27,490
Your comfy bed.

8811
09:19:28,470 --> 09:19:29,050
Go back?

8812
09:19:30,670 --> 09:19:31,990
Too late!

8813
09:19:32,450 --> 09:19:33,790
Thank you!

8814
09:19:35,670 --> 09:19:37,910
MGS Con overlaps with another convention that weekend.

8815
09:19:38,090 --> 09:19:38,430
No!

8816
09:19:42,770 --> 09:19:43,950
You skipped the ration.

8817
09:19:44,250 --> 09:19:45,650
Mod, I'm about to time you out.

8818
09:19:45,730 --> 09:19:47,990
You're sounding a lot like a backseater right now, okay?

8819
09:19:51,450 --> 09:19:52,510
God damn it!

8820
09:19:52,570 --> 09:19:53,350
What the hell?

8821
09:20:08,240 --> 09:20:08,920
Welcome... What?

8822
09:20:09,020 --> 09:20:10,740
Do I reset and reload?

8823
09:20:10,980 --> 09:20:11,320
No!

8824
09:20:11,960 --> 09:20:13,120
If I die, whatever.

8825
09:20:13,440 --> 09:20:14,820
I'll get the ration then.

8826
09:20:15,620 --> 09:20:17,340
Welcome, Solid Snake.

8827
09:20:20,400 --> 09:20:21,000
Viper!

8828
09:20:25,480 --> 09:20:26,680
He's awesome!

8829
09:20:27,840 --> 09:20:29,520
Wait, he looks so cool!

8830
09:20:30,080 --> 09:20:31,260
I made a promise to you.

8831
09:20:32,640 --> 09:20:35,560
And now is the time for you to die.

8832
09:20:37,620 --> 09:20:38,420
Where's Chris?

8833
09:20:39,480 --> 09:20:39,780
Kaiba.

8834
09:20:39,880 --> 09:20:40,980
Yeah, he looks like Kaiba.

8835
09:20:41,100 --> 09:20:41,760
Seto Kaiba.

8836
09:20:42,560 --> 09:20:43,900
Patience is a virtue, Snake.

8837
09:20:44,820 --> 09:20:46,780
You'll see her soon enough.

8838
09:20:48,420 --> 09:20:50,740
Viper, I know about Black Chamber.

8839
09:20:51,560 --> 09:20:53,560
Being Foxhound's shadow.

8840
09:20:54,860 --> 09:20:56,080
But why revenge?

8841
09:20:57,960 --> 09:20:59,420
What happened two years ago?

8842
09:21:01,280 --> 09:21:03,840
Alright, I'll tell you about it.

8843
09:21:04,960 --> 09:21:10,360
And having learned what your crimes are, you'll rot in hell.

8844
09:21:10,360 --> 09:21:17,600
Two years ago, we, the Black Chamber, were given a top secret mission.

8845
09:21:21,160 --> 09:21:23,180
The recovery of Metal Gear.

8846
09:21:24,540 --> 09:21:25,920
The game is quiet?

8847
09:21:28,920 --> 09:21:29,500
Did you hear that?

8848
09:21:30,420 --> 09:21:32,320
Why is Mr. Vector so stupid?

8849
09:21:38,430 --> 09:21:47,190
Metal Gear's development had been underway for several years at that point.

8850
09:21:48,690 --> 09:21:50,270
Under CIA supervision.

8851
09:21:52,910 --> 09:21:54,030
There was no music?

8852
09:21:54,170 --> 09:21:58,690
Yeah, but I thought they meant it was quiet because they couldn't hear the...

8853
09:22:01,910 --> 09:22:02,450
CIA?

8854
09:22:04,170 --> 09:22:05,790
I told you it was McGregor.

8855
09:22:06,570 --> 09:22:10,950
A South American terrorist group seized it two years ago.

8856
09:22:11,150 --> 09:22:13,190
He said he didn't know anything.

8857
09:22:13,390 --> 09:22:14,650
The CIA didn't know anything.

8858
09:22:15,290 --> 09:22:16,950
And Black Chamber was sent in.

8859
09:22:18,230 --> 09:22:20,310
Just as you were this time.

8860
09:22:24,020 --> 09:22:29,860
We took heavy damage, but succeeded in destroying Metal Gear.

8861
09:22:29,860 --> 09:22:49,480
But some in the government were afraid that the fact of Metal Gear's development, the existence of Black Chamber, and above all else, the work we had been doing, would become public knowledge.

8862
09:22:49,480 --> 09:22:57,020
When we came home, many of the unit missing, the rest wounded.

8863
09:22:57,960 --> 09:23:00,480
We were met by government sent...

8864
09:23:01,620 --> 09:23:05,840
Government sent assassins.

8865
09:23:08,440 --> 09:23:09,300
Foxhound.

8866
09:23:11,420 --> 09:23:12,280
What?

8867
09:23:13,700 --> 09:23:18,720
My men were cut down, unarmed, caught in the trap.

8868
09:23:20,200 --> 09:23:24,480
Without a chance, without even knowing why.

8869
09:23:24,980 --> 09:23:29,380
Senseless and sudden death, crushed like insects.

8870
09:23:32,260 --> 09:23:35,140
I can never forget that night.

8871
09:23:36,120 --> 09:23:38,860
I still don't know who ordered our deaths.

8872
09:23:40,660 --> 09:23:44,120
The real name appears nowhere on classified records.

8873
09:23:45,220 --> 09:23:47,560
He is only referred to as...

8874
09:23:47,560 --> 09:23:47,860
Burger.

8875
09:23:50,840 --> 09:23:51,520
Anonymous.

8876
09:23:51,520 --> 09:23:53,480
That's why they were like...

8877
09:23:53,480 --> 09:23:54,660
Yeah, down with Anonymous!

8878
09:23:56,420 --> 09:23:58,300
I have a feeling it's because of Updog.

8879
09:24:00,920 --> 09:24:01,600
Anonymous.

8880
09:24:03,880 --> 09:24:06,420
Those of us who survived bowed vengeance.

8881
09:24:09,860 --> 09:24:11,220
When I settled here.

8882
09:24:12,440 --> 09:24:13,200
Outer Heaven.

8883
09:24:13,800 --> 09:24:14,480
Metal Gear.

8884
09:24:14,480 --> 09:24:16,060
Project Babble.

8885
09:24:16,200 --> 09:24:17,460
I haven't heard Project Babble.

8886
09:24:17,540 --> 09:24:18,680
What's the ghost part?

8887
09:24:19,440 --> 09:24:23,740
It all began here.

8888
09:24:24,800 --> 09:24:27,140
I have waited two years for this moment.

8889
09:24:29,940 --> 09:24:30,520
Anonymous.

8890
09:24:31,460 --> 09:24:34,120
Now, for the happy reunion.

8891
09:24:35,840 --> 09:24:38,040
I'm sure it was worth the wait.

8892
09:24:39,700 --> 09:24:40,420
Chris!

8893
09:24:40,420 --> 09:24:40,660
Chris!

8894
09:24:44,200 --> 09:24:46,360
Snake, I'm sorry.

8895
09:24:48,020 --> 09:24:49,660
She's really something.

8896
09:24:50,540 --> 09:24:53,660
Even let her Delta Force pals die.

8897
09:24:54,440 --> 09:25:00,340
While she got busy destroying evidence of Project Babble.

8898
09:25:02,400 --> 09:25:07,740
As a reward from Parker, I will let her see the show.

8899
09:25:11,860 --> 09:25:14,740
Of the end of the legend.

8900
09:25:16,720 --> 09:25:20,160
The execution of Solid Snake.

8901
09:25:22,040 --> 09:25:24,800
No, Chris is coming with me.

8902
09:25:25,440 --> 09:25:27,780
After I take you down.

8903
09:25:29,480 --> 09:25:31,960
I'm going to enjoy this.

8904
09:25:32,540 --> 09:25:34,680
Come on, show me what you've got.

8905
09:25:38,360 --> 09:25:40,440
Well, let's finish this.

8906
09:25:41,220 --> 09:25:42,080
Oh, gosh.

8907
09:25:42,260 --> 09:25:42,400
Okay.

8908
09:25:46,980 --> 09:25:49,000
How is best to fight?

8909
09:25:50,880 --> 09:25:54,320
They were giving me a lot of...

8910
09:25:54,960 --> 09:25:57,320
A lot of chaff.

8911
09:26:00,220 --> 09:26:03,940
They gave me a lot of chaff, but I don't know if that's for Metal Gear.

8912
09:26:16,370 --> 09:26:17,890
Use the landmines.

8913
09:26:18,910 --> 09:26:20,250
Feed them like Grape Box.

8914
09:26:24,730 --> 09:26:25,570
Oh, my God.

8915
09:26:27,630 --> 09:26:28,750
He's running away.

8916
09:26:32,610 --> 09:26:34,250
Oh, I see.

8917
09:26:34,590 --> 09:26:35,230
Oh, my gosh.

8918
09:26:41,780 --> 09:26:43,260
Why did it do that?

8919
09:26:43,480 --> 09:26:44,520
Oh, my God, you guys.

8920
09:26:50,020 --> 09:26:53,060
Okay, now I can go back for that other ration.

8921
09:26:55,560 --> 09:26:56,440
So misleading.

8922
09:26:56,840 --> 09:27:01,320
Didn't I think people were just going to go to the end of the map before they go through the first door?

8923
09:27:01,740 --> 09:27:04,120
I thought the battle would be at the end of the map.

8924
09:27:04,500 --> 09:27:06,360
Wait, do I have to go through that whole cutscene again?

8925
09:27:06,560 --> 09:27:07,240
Oh, man.

8926
09:27:09,020 --> 09:27:09,440
Okay.

8927
09:27:10,960 --> 09:27:11,800
Let's heal.

8928
09:27:13,600 --> 09:27:14,480
And armor.

8929
09:27:16,240 --> 09:27:17,240
And go through.

8930
09:27:18,380 --> 09:27:19,820
And can I skip?

8931
09:27:25,740 --> 09:27:26,300
Save.

8932
09:27:26,380 --> 09:27:29,120
You guys, I click continue.

8933
09:27:30,100 --> 09:27:32,340
It doesn't matter if I save or not.

8934
09:27:33,660 --> 09:27:35,860
It doesn't matter if I save or not.

8935
09:27:36,100 --> 09:27:36,580
Hold B.

8936
09:27:43,940 --> 09:27:44,500
Okay.

8937
09:27:47,760 --> 09:27:50,160
This fight seems a little nasty.

8938
09:28:05,690 --> 09:28:07,070
Save after the cutscene?

8939
09:28:07,210 --> 09:28:07,750
You know what?

8940
09:28:07,850 --> 09:28:09,070
Sure, why not?

8941
09:28:10,290 --> 09:28:11,330
Oh, my God, Chris.

8942
09:28:12,290 --> 09:28:13,170
Oh, my God.

8943
09:28:15,930 --> 09:28:18,490
Maybe I'll save it in battle, actually.

8944
09:28:20,070 --> 09:28:20,730
The show.

8945
09:28:21,350 --> 09:28:22,350
The downfall.

8946
09:28:22,910 --> 09:28:23,690
Okay, here we go.

8947
09:28:24,270 --> 09:28:26,130
I have to switch my weapon anyway.

8948
09:28:29,890 --> 09:28:30,990
There we go.

8949
09:28:31,150 --> 09:28:32,270
That scared me for a second.

8950
09:28:33,150 --> 09:28:33,470
Dang.

8951
09:28:37,380 --> 09:28:37,820
Snake.

8952
09:28:38,140 --> 09:28:39,820
Oh, I almost just knocked over my phone.

8953
09:28:40,000 --> 09:28:40,460
Are you alright?

8954
09:28:40,980 --> 09:28:41,820
Not really.

8955
09:28:44,280 --> 09:28:46,100
Snake, come back to us safely.

8956
09:28:47,180 --> 09:28:48,000
Thank you, Meiling.

8957
09:28:52,580 --> 09:28:53,560
Where is he?

8958
09:28:53,700 --> 09:28:53,960
Oh,

8959
09:28:58,290 --> 09:28:58,930
I got him though.

8960
09:29:01,970 --> 09:29:02,830
Is he down here?

8961
09:29:03,630 --> 09:29:04,130
Oh, my gosh.

8962
09:29:07,170 --> 09:29:08,370
Where the hell is he?

8963
09:29:10,770 --> 09:29:12,790
I couldn't avoid that one.

8964
09:29:13,750 --> 09:29:14,810
I'm trapped.

8965
09:29:19,720 --> 09:29:20,800
Oh, there he is.

8966
09:29:21,780 --> 09:29:22,420
Oh, my God.

8967
09:29:22,680 --> 09:29:23,480
You little bitch.

8968
09:29:28,620 --> 09:29:30,420
Piece of pain in my ass.

8969
09:29:35,980 --> 09:29:36,280
Yeah.

8970
09:29:36,440 --> 09:29:37,740
Oh, he hopped over me.

8971
09:29:37,740 --> 09:29:38,060
Oh, my God.

8972
09:29:46,440 --> 09:29:49,460
This is a pain in my ass.

8973
09:29:50,460 --> 09:29:53,360
This is such a silly fight.

8974
09:29:53,640 --> 09:29:54,400
Oh, you bitch.

8975
09:29:54,740 --> 09:29:55,320
No, you bitch.

8976
09:30:01,090 --> 09:30:01,930
No, no.

8977
09:30:01,990 --> 09:30:02,950
I can't avoid either.

8978
09:30:03,370 --> 09:30:03,850
Oh, okay.

8979
09:30:03,990 --> 09:30:04,110
Phew.

8980
09:30:11,260 --> 09:30:11,820
Hello.

8981
09:30:12,860 --> 09:30:13,360
Where are you?

8982
09:30:14,240 --> 09:30:15,980
I think he's...

8983
09:30:15,980 --> 09:30:16,500
Ouch!

8984
09:30:26,430 --> 09:30:28,550
Oh, gosh.

8985
09:30:29,410 --> 09:30:29,830
Okay.

8986
09:30:30,990 --> 09:30:32,090
We're doing something.

8987
09:30:34,650 --> 09:30:39,290
What a weirdo this guy is.

8988
09:30:47,680 --> 09:30:48,180
Okay.

8989
09:31:01,610 --> 09:31:02,730
Can't tell.

8990
09:31:11,550 --> 09:31:13,410
Viper, you little bitch, you.

8991
09:31:13,570 --> 09:31:14,230
Come here.

8992
09:31:14,230 --> 09:31:16,010
I'm like so concentrated.

8993
09:31:16,170 --> 09:31:16,770
Sorry, guys.

8994
09:31:21,010 --> 09:31:22,170
Did I get him?

8995
09:31:22,690 --> 09:31:23,230
Where is he?

8996
09:31:24,890 --> 09:31:26,730
I don't know at all where he is.

8997
09:31:27,590 --> 09:31:28,290
Oh, my gosh.

8998
09:31:28,490 --> 09:31:29,050
Oh, there he is.

8999
09:31:29,290 --> 09:31:29,710
Oh, shoot.

9000
09:31:30,110 --> 09:31:30,170
No!

9001
09:31:38,170 --> 09:31:38,610
Viper.

9002
09:31:48,160 --> 09:31:50,620
I didn't have a good time with that.

9003
09:31:53,880 --> 09:31:55,360
I can't avoid it.

9004
09:31:55,900 --> 09:31:56,960
That's so unfair.

9005
09:31:57,700 --> 09:31:58,540
That's so unfair.

9006
09:32:12,080 --> 09:32:13,040
Oh, my God.

9007
09:32:15,200 --> 09:32:16,520
I think I got him, though.

9008
09:32:17,640 --> 09:32:18,420
Did I hit him?

9009
09:32:20,520 --> 09:32:21,560
Oh, where is he?

9010
09:32:23,600 --> 09:32:24,440
Where is he?

9011
09:32:25,520 --> 09:32:26,340
Is he down here?

9012
09:32:27,680 --> 09:32:28,540
I don't know.

9013
09:32:29,180 --> 09:32:30,960
There he... Oh, damn it.

9014
09:32:32,040 --> 09:32:33,120
Okay, at least I hit him.

9015
09:32:33,680 --> 09:32:34,820
It was not in vain.

9016
09:32:35,440 --> 09:32:36,500
It was not in vain.

9017
09:32:42,120 --> 09:32:46,260
Please stop putting me in this terrible situation.

9018
09:32:56,950 --> 09:32:59,910
I think he is in the top right... or top left.

9019
09:33:00,110 --> 09:33:00,630
Damn it.

9020
09:33:01,430 --> 09:33:04,930
I hate fights when it forces you...

9021
09:33:05,530 --> 09:33:07,350
And it wouldn't let me use Nikita.

9022
09:33:11,450 --> 09:33:14,930
So I couldn't... I can't use Nikita missiles on him.

9023
09:33:14,930 --> 09:33:15,790
I don't think.

9024
09:33:16,010 --> 09:33:17,030
Let me double check.

9025
09:33:17,910 --> 09:33:18,590
Yeah, I see.

9026
09:33:19,450 --> 09:33:22,410
I think because of the strings, technically, you can't use it.

9027
09:33:23,610 --> 09:33:26,450
Celebrating my 5th minute anniversary of my birthday.

9028
09:33:26,790 --> 09:33:27,830
Why 7th birthday?

9029
09:33:28,390 --> 09:33:31,070
Please remind me about it after this fight.

9030
09:33:31,630 --> 09:33:32,570
Someone, please.

9031
09:33:32,850 --> 09:33:33,850
So I can sing you happy birthday.

9032
09:33:34,930 --> 09:33:37,630
I don't want to give you just a quick one, you know?

9033
09:33:37,650 --> 09:33:39,310
I want to sing you a proper happy birthday.

9034
09:33:41,210 --> 09:33:41,870
Oh, my God.

9035
09:33:41,910 --> 09:33:43,130
Please let me out of here.

9036
09:33:47,750 --> 09:33:48,630
Let me out!

9037
09:33:53,260 --> 09:33:54,560
Oh, my God.

9038
09:33:54,700 --> 09:33:55,940
I keep getting the save.

9039
09:33:59,530 --> 09:34:01,030
What is this?

9040
09:34:01,310 --> 09:34:02,430
This is unfair.

9041
09:34:02,910 --> 09:34:03,850
The game is broken.

9042
09:34:05,450 --> 09:34:06,950
Let me out!

9043
09:34:09,770 --> 09:34:10,990
Let me out!

9044
09:34:11,730 --> 09:34:12,630
Oh, thank God.

9045
09:34:16,070 --> 09:34:17,210
That's right.

9046
09:34:17,570 --> 09:34:18,110
Finally.

9047
09:34:18,810 --> 09:34:20,230
Get your stupid ass.

9048
09:34:20,810 --> 09:34:21,550
Stupid.

9049
09:34:22,550 --> 09:34:24,810
You stupid bitch.

9050
09:34:35,120 --> 09:34:36,280
Stupid!

9051
09:34:37,860 --> 09:34:39,920
Being found 12 times.

9052
09:34:41,100 --> 09:34:42,260
Stupid!

9053
09:34:44,620 --> 09:34:45,520
No.

9054
09:34:45,860 --> 09:34:46,860
No way.

9055
09:34:46,980 --> 09:34:47,140
Good.

9056
09:34:50,070 --> 09:34:51,530
But it isn't over yet.

9057
09:34:54,860 --> 09:34:55,320
What's that?

9058
09:34:55,360 --> 09:34:55,780
Oh no.

9059
09:34:56,800 --> 09:34:57,260
Damn!

9060
09:34:58,680 --> 09:35:00,160
Grab her.

9061
09:35:02,140 --> 09:35:02,940
Oh, okay.

9062
09:35:03,080 --> 09:35:03,200
Good.

9063
09:35:03,320 --> 09:35:04,640
Help her and then make her run.

9064
09:35:04,800 --> 09:35:05,080
You know what?

9065
09:35:05,100 --> 09:35:06,000
That's so much better.

9066
09:35:12,070 --> 09:35:12,470
Alright.

9067
09:35:12,570 --> 09:35:14,150
One last final battle, everybody.

9068
09:35:17,430 --> 09:35:18,690
Chris, are you hurt anywhere?

9069
09:35:22,430 --> 09:35:22,830
No.

9070
09:35:23,030 --> 09:35:24,070
I'm so sorry.

9071
09:35:24,290 --> 09:35:24,490
Wait.

9072
09:35:24,530 --> 09:35:25,070
Hold on real quick.

9073
09:35:35,230 --> 09:35:35,630
Okay.

9074
09:35:36,690 --> 09:35:37,730
I'm so sorry.

9075
09:35:39,470 --> 09:35:40,030
Don't be.

9076
09:35:41,030 --> 09:35:42,990
I have to be.

9077
09:35:45,370 --> 09:35:46,950
Sad Chris.

9078
09:35:47,590 --> 09:35:48,430
Oh, birthday!

9079
09:35:48,790 --> 09:35:49,430
Yes, thank you!

9080
09:35:49,850 --> 09:35:52,320
Happy birthday to you.

9081
09:35:53,070 --> 09:35:55,530
Happy birthday to you.

9082
09:35:55,970 --> 09:35:58,950
Happy birthday dear Bryce.

9083
09:36:00,130 --> 09:36:03,350
Happy birthday to you.

9084
09:36:04,990 --> 09:36:06,170
Happy birthday!

9085
09:36:10,230 --> 09:36:11,030
Okay.

9086
09:36:15,120 --> 09:36:16,520
I have to be.

9087
09:36:16,760 --> 09:36:18,220
I've been lying to you.

9088
09:36:19,160 --> 09:36:24,600
You mean because you weren't there when your team was wiped out?

9089
09:36:26,500 --> 09:36:27,040
You knew?

9090
09:36:28,180 --> 09:36:28,960
Yes.

9091
09:36:30,440 --> 09:36:34,280
I was given orders directly by Parker.

9092
09:36:35,600 --> 09:36:37,860
The army chief of staff.

9093
09:36:40,180 --> 09:36:41,760
What kind of mission?

9094
09:36:44,080 --> 09:36:49,200
The destruction of all data on the project Babel.

9095
09:36:49,640 --> 09:36:51,700
And Outer Heaven.

9096
09:36:52,200 --> 09:36:56,820
And the assassination of the general.

9097
09:36:58,400 --> 09:36:58,600
What?

9098
09:37:02,160 --> 09:37:07,520
I was told that the information had to be buried for the good of the world.

9099
09:37:09,880 --> 09:37:12,320
Snake looks like Ben Stiller here.

9100
09:37:12,380 --> 09:37:13,560
He really does.

9101
09:37:14,400 --> 09:37:16,680
He looks straight out of Zoolander.

9102
09:37:18,020 --> 09:37:20,840
And that the general would have to be as well.

9103
09:37:21,600 --> 09:37:24,360
Before he was arrested and talked.

9104
09:37:26,680 --> 09:37:28,620
You believed that?

9105
09:37:31,760 --> 09:37:32,900
For my country.

9106
09:37:33,220 --> 09:37:34,040
For the world.

9107
09:37:34,800 --> 09:37:36,780
What else do I have to believe in?

9108
09:37:38,860 --> 09:37:39,520
Chris.

9109
09:37:40,320 --> 09:37:42,520
That's why Snake spins around sometimes.

9110
09:37:42,640 --> 09:37:45,360
He can only turn left, you know.

9111
09:37:47,520 --> 09:37:51,620
So he's trying to turn, but he can't, you know.

9112
09:37:51,800 --> 09:37:53,700
He can only go one way.

9113
09:37:55,980 --> 09:37:58,800
And so I fell away from the rest of the team.

9114
09:38:01,460 --> 09:38:02,500
And they...

9115
09:38:02,500 --> 09:38:07,420
I thought I could find something to cherish.

9116
09:38:08,230 --> 09:38:11,120
Something sure and concrete.

9117
09:38:12,580 --> 09:38:15,980
But there wasn't anything like that.

9118
09:38:18,540 --> 09:38:20,840
And insisted I lost...

9119
09:38:20,840 --> 09:38:24,420
Oh, instead I lost something that I cherished even more.

9120
09:38:25,800 --> 09:38:28,360
I was so afraid of losing it again.

9121
09:38:29,660 --> 09:38:33,720
But I just couldn't tell you.

9122
09:38:35,280 --> 09:38:36,860
I love you.

9123
09:38:40,790 --> 09:38:42,430
I'm getting so sleepy, you guys.

9124
09:38:42,510 --> 09:38:43,490
It's almost 2 AM for me.

9125
09:38:44,150 --> 09:38:46,290
This was much longer than I anticipated.

9126
09:38:47,230 --> 09:38:50,070
I thought it would be like 8-9 hours.

9127
09:38:50,370 --> 09:38:51,930
Not 10 hours, but that's okay.

9128
09:38:52,690 --> 09:38:53,150
Oh, Chris.

9129
09:38:53,270 --> 09:38:53,630
Oh, shoot.

9130
09:38:53,710 --> 09:38:54,450
I didn't get to read that.

9131
09:38:54,530 --> 09:38:54,630
Sorry.

9132
09:38:55,150 --> 09:38:56,830
Find us something fast to escape on.

9133
09:39:00,610 --> 09:39:03,890
So that we can get out of here quickly.

9134
09:39:03,890 --> 09:39:06,670
Once I've destroyed Metal Gear.

9135
09:39:09,670 --> 09:39:11,190
You still trust me?

9136
09:39:13,570 --> 09:39:17,290
It's true that you didn't tell me the truth.

9137
09:39:18,290 --> 09:39:19,710
But I trust you.

9138
09:39:21,330 --> 09:39:22,850
She looks pregnant in this sprite.

9139
09:39:23,190 --> 09:39:24,650
I don't know what it is.

9140
09:39:25,170 --> 09:39:25,630
Why?

9141
09:39:28,070 --> 09:39:29,410
Because I want to.

9142
09:39:33,040 --> 09:39:34,280
Do you guys see it too?

9143
09:39:34,280 --> 09:39:37,160
It looks like her hand is on her tummy or something.

9144
09:39:38,860 --> 09:39:42,060
Yeah, it looks like the pregnant emoji.

9145
09:39:44,660 --> 09:39:46,720
I don't understand what position...

9146
09:39:47,040 --> 09:39:49,980
I think maybe it's supposed to be similar to Snake.

9147
09:39:50,140 --> 09:39:53,820
But they gave Snake's left leg more...

9148
09:39:54,620 --> 09:39:55,520
Pushed forward.

9149
09:39:55,760 --> 09:39:58,480
So that's why it works out that he looks like he's standing diagonally.

9150
09:39:59,120 --> 09:40:00,220
But not her.

9151
09:40:01,060 --> 09:40:01,500
Do

9152
09:40:04,690 --> 09:40:07,410
I need any other reason?

9153
09:40:08,990 --> 09:40:10,010
Thank you.

9154
09:40:11,170 --> 09:40:12,810
I'll find something.

9155
09:40:13,490 --> 09:40:14,270
I promise.

9156
09:40:15,290 --> 09:40:15,670
Alright.

9157
09:40:16,730 --> 09:40:17,610
For the baby.

9158
09:40:26,730 --> 09:40:27,610
Snake.

9159
09:40:28,310 --> 09:40:30,470
Metal Gear is through there.

9160
09:40:30,850 --> 09:40:31,170
Hurry.

9161
09:40:33,610 --> 09:40:34,050
Nice.

9162
09:40:39,890 --> 09:40:40,950
I can go through here.

9163
09:40:41,090 --> 09:40:41,510
That's fun.

9164
09:40:44,310 --> 09:40:46,170
Yay, new music.

9165
09:40:48,930 --> 09:40:49,810
C4.

9166
09:40:50,130 --> 09:40:50,210
Okay.

9167
09:40:51,970 --> 09:40:52,850
C4.

9168
09:40:55,430 --> 09:40:56,310
Grenade.

9169
09:40:57,630 --> 09:40:58,890
Anything else?

9170
09:41:03,030 --> 09:41:07,120
How many rations do I have anyway?

9171
09:41:07,340 --> 09:41:08,280
Two or one?

9172
09:41:09,860 --> 09:41:10,620
Two!

9173
09:41:10,860 --> 09:41:11,240
Okay.

9174
09:41:11,520 --> 09:41:11,960
Nice.

9175
09:41:13,160 --> 09:41:14,680
Already missing the beep beep?

9176
09:41:14,940 --> 09:41:16,560
You are alone in that, my friend.

9177
09:41:18,140 --> 09:41:19,720
You are alone in that.

9178
09:41:27,780 --> 09:41:28,280
Jam?

9179
09:41:34,460 --> 09:41:35,800
I'm nervous here though.

9180
09:41:38,060 --> 09:41:39,480
Oh, is that just a regular item?

9181
09:41:43,680 --> 09:41:44,180
Landmine.

9182
09:41:44,300 --> 09:41:45,120
Oh, okay.

9183
09:41:46,360 --> 09:41:47,140
I don't know.

9184
09:41:47,280 --> 09:41:49,160
I feel like they would do something like this, you know.

9185
09:41:49,540 --> 09:41:49,860
Grenade.

9186
09:41:51,560 --> 09:41:53,600
Okay, I don't want to get run over by a truck.

9187
09:41:53,720 --> 09:41:55,700
Oh my gosh, it's a...

9188
09:41:55,700 --> 09:41:57,860
It's just what they call...

9189
09:42:00,340 --> 09:42:01,360
Phantom no nazo.

9190
09:42:04,940 --> 09:42:06,800
Make sure we don't miss anything, guys.

9191
09:42:13,270 --> 09:42:13,430
Oh.

9192
09:42:14,590 --> 09:42:15,230
Nikita ammo.

9193
09:42:15,910 --> 09:42:17,570
Okay, maybe there's nothing here.

9194
09:42:17,770 --> 09:42:18,690
Okay, maybe I'm safe.

9195
09:42:19,430 --> 09:42:20,210
I'm so paranoid.

9196
09:42:22,210 --> 09:42:24,830
I'm like, oh, they didn't throw...

9197
09:42:24,830 --> 09:42:26,710
They didn't give us a landmine section.

9198
09:42:27,770 --> 09:42:29,310
In the very last building.

9199
09:42:30,090 --> 09:42:31,570
Surely there's landmines here.

9200
09:42:34,030 --> 09:42:34,750
Grenade.

9201
09:42:35,950 --> 09:42:36,870
Oh, there we go.

9202
09:42:37,810 --> 09:42:38,210
Stop.

9203
09:42:41,300 --> 09:42:47,580
I see that the little vendetta has been played out to its conclusion.

9204
09:42:50,220 --> 09:42:51,960
Wow, Metal Gear!

9205
09:42:53,620 --> 09:42:55,240
Why does it have big ol' hands?

9206
09:42:55,260 --> 09:42:56,480
Oh, those are the ray guns.

9207
09:42:57,280 --> 09:42:57,620
General.

9208
09:42:59,980 --> 09:43:02,520
Once a loser, always a loser.

9209
09:43:02,820 --> 09:43:03,660
Eh, Snake?

9210
09:43:05,800 --> 09:43:06,920
I think...

9211
09:43:06,920 --> 09:43:07,800
I'm...

9212
09:43:07,800 --> 09:43:10,460
I wiped out your whole team, General.

9213
09:43:11,180 --> 09:43:12,640
What do you mean, once a loser?

9214
09:43:12,760 --> 09:43:14,740
I also defeated the previous Metal Gear.

9215
09:43:14,740 --> 09:43:17,580
I'm kinda confused with that...

9216
09:43:18,480 --> 09:43:19,980
What is he on about?

9217
09:43:20,060 --> 09:43:20,720
I don't know.

9218
09:43:21,900 --> 09:43:23,100
Liquid Vamp?

9219
09:43:23,320 --> 09:43:24,800
Yeah, he does look like Vamp.

9220
09:43:27,320 --> 09:43:29,680
The last one standing is the winner.

9221
09:43:31,340 --> 09:43:32,020
Snake!

9222
09:43:32,700 --> 09:43:34,440
And that would be myself.

9223
09:43:35,140 --> 09:43:40,680
Not you, not Black Chamber, and certainly not America.

9224
09:43:40,680 --> 09:43:44,820
I used them all, you see.

9225
09:43:45,300 --> 09:43:47,120
Parker, Black Chamber.

9226
09:43:48,940 --> 09:43:49,200
What?

9227
09:43:50,360 --> 09:43:55,900
I triple-crossed them!

9228
09:43:56,560 --> 09:44:02,060
Or just set the cover on Outer Heaven.

9229
09:44:03,140 --> 09:44:04,460
And Project Babel?

9230
09:44:05,220 --> 09:44:09,500
Or rather, the truth about GILF and the US.

9231
09:44:11,440 --> 09:44:14,320
The Metal Gear crosses, of course.

9232
09:44:15,120 --> 09:44:17,200
Nobody has loyalty in this series.

9233
09:44:17,540 --> 09:44:21,640
Except Ocelot, because he has way too much loyalty to one person.

9234
09:44:22,060 --> 09:44:25,140
And therefore interferes with his other loyalties, you know what I mean?

9235
09:44:26,680 --> 09:44:27,720
Villain arrogance?

9236
09:44:27,880 --> 09:44:28,620
Yeah, maybe.

9237
09:44:29,760 --> 09:44:31,220
Just like that woman.

9238
09:44:32,700 --> 09:44:34,080
GILF and the US.

9239
09:44:34,840 --> 09:44:35,720
GILF and us?

9240
09:44:36,160 --> 09:44:36,940
What truth?

9241
09:44:37,860 --> 09:44:39,360
Ha ha ha.

9242
09:44:39,780 --> 09:44:42,020
So you're nothing but a pawn to...

9243
09:44:43,100 --> 09:44:45,840
Just like Viper and his lot.

9244
09:44:48,220 --> 09:44:52,900
There's a connection between GILF and the States and Outer Heaven?

9245
09:44:53,040 --> 09:44:55,500
Wait, there's a connection between GILTS, the States, and Outer Heaven?

9246
09:44:57,340 --> 09:44:57,880
Fine.

9247
09:44:58,220 --> 09:44:59,940
I will tell you all about...

9248
09:45:00,620 --> 09:45:01,560
If you win.

9249
09:45:02,280 --> 09:45:03,940
Winner takes it all.

9250
09:45:04,280 --> 09:45:05,940
Loser relinquishes...

9251
09:45:06,380 --> 09:45:06,820
All.

9252
09:45:08,220 --> 09:45:10,400
That is the way of the world.

9253
09:45:11,760 --> 09:45:14,580
And you will abide by it, Snake.

9254
09:45:17,400 --> 09:45:20,040
Wow, this Metal Gear is really cute.

9255
09:45:20,160 --> 09:45:21,360
It kind of looks like a Stingray.

9256
09:45:22,120 --> 09:45:23,320
I'm a bit of a fan.

9257
09:45:25,540 --> 09:45:27,200
But I wish it had a name.

9258
09:45:27,600 --> 09:45:28,280
What do you call it?

9259
09:45:28,320 --> 09:45:29,780
Metal Gear Babel, I guess?

9260
09:45:32,820 --> 09:45:35,960
Snake, Metal Gear must be destroyed.

9261
09:45:37,580 --> 09:45:40,040
It looks like Rex and Rey combined.

9262
09:45:40,940 --> 09:45:41,680
It's Gander.

9263
09:45:45,710 --> 09:45:46,750
Gander?

9264
09:45:52,330 --> 09:45:53,450
Damn Gander?

9265
09:45:56,970 --> 09:45:58,530
Damn Tender.

9266
09:46:00,330 --> 09:46:01,710
Damn Tender?

9267
09:46:14,790 --> 09:46:15,390
Funny.

9268
09:46:17,650 --> 09:46:18,750
Damn Tender?

9269
09:46:20,130 --> 09:46:25,930
I've always wanted to tell Raura that I love that moment so much.

9270
09:46:26,330 --> 09:46:28,330
I think of it often.

9271
09:46:29,950 --> 09:46:31,910
Take out its legs first of all.

9272
09:46:32,550 --> 09:46:34,770
Hit it hard with mines and C4.

9273
09:46:34,870 --> 09:46:37,010
Oh my gosh, Campbell is being...

9274
09:46:37,010 --> 09:46:39,150
He is being so useful.

9275
09:46:40,610 --> 09:46:41,210
Amazing.

9276
09:46:41,410 --> 09:46:41,950
Oh my god.

9277
09:46:41,950 --> 09:46:42,390
Okay.

9278
09:46:42,710 --> 09:46:43,430
Oh god.

9279
09:46:43,610 --> 09:46:44,790
Warning though, please.

9280
09:46:44,970 --> 09:46:45,410
Thank you.

9281
09:46:47,510 --> 09:46:47,990
Alright.

9282
09:46:47,990 --> 09:46:48,470
C4.

9283
09:46:52,590 --> 09:46:53,310
Oh my god.

9284
09:46:53,670 --> 09:46:53,910
Ouch.

9285
09:46:56,290 --> 09:46:58,110
That didn't work as planned.

9286
09:46:59,270 --> 09:47:01,150
Where the hell... What the hell is this fight?

9287
09:47:02,870 --> 09:47:03,350
Run!

9288
09:47:07,290 --> 09:47:09,370
I think I'm not doing such a good job, you guys.

9289
09:47:13,130 --> 09:47:14,930
Why isn't... Why are my...

9290
09:47:15,450 --> 09:47:17,310
Why are my things exploding?

9291
09:47:18,150 --> 09:47:19,370
It's stepping on you.

9292
09:47:19,410 --> 09:47:19,810
Yeah, I know.

9293
09:47:19,890 --> 09:47:21,990
I'm trying to put... Oh my god, I'm all the way back here.

9294
09:47:23,210 --> 09:47:25,130
I'm trying to put...

9295
09:47:25,870 --> 09:47:29,290
The C4 under its foot and explode it.

9296
09:47:30,370 --> 09:47:31,290
Use mines?

9297
09:47:31,430 --> 09:47:32,950
Okay, we'll use the landmines instead.

9298
09:47:34,110 --> 09:47:35,730
Or isn't there another thing over here?

9299
09:47:44,210 --> 09:47:46,810
He said C4 also works.

9300
09:47:46,810 --> 09:47:48,410
I'm not crazy!

9301
09:48:10,190 --> 09:48:11,670
I'll try the landmines instead.

9302
09:48:16,590 --> 09:48:18,910
It's just... How do I see where he lands?

9303
09:48:19,010 --> 09:48:19,550
I thought that...

9304
09:48:21,650 --> 09:48:24,150
I thought that I would be able to blow it up.

9305
09:48:25,590 --> 09:48:27,310
But I feel like there is more items.

9306
09:48:29,210 --> 09:48:29,910
You know, whatever.

9307
09:48:30,070 --> 09:48:30,390
It's fine.

9308
09:48:34,660 --> 09:48:34,780
Oh.

9309
09:48:36,400 --> 09:48:37,240
Brand-night.

9310
09:48:39,660 --> 09:48:40,220
Okay.

9311
09:48:42,940 --> 09:48:45,120
You have to detonate the C4.

9312
09:48:45,200 --> 09:48:47,680
Yeah, but I couldn't get... That's the issue.

9313
09:48:48,040 --> 09:48:50,960
I couldn't because I would get exploded upon.

9314
09:48:52,420 --> 09:48:56,900
I would get exploded upon and then I would press A and it wouldn't work.

9315
09:48:57,380 --> 09:48:57,860
That's why.

9316
09:48:59,260 --> 09:48:59,700
Okay.

9317
09:49:01,440 --> 09:49:04,020
This goes bad with one of the non-canon games.

9318
09:49:04,120 --> 09:49:05,860
I think it's like pseudo-canon.

9319
09:49:07,240 --> 09:49:09,240
It's referenced in...

9320
09:49:12,040 --> 09:49:13,080
In MGS2.

9321
09:49:14,760 --> 09:49:16,360
Take out its legs first of all.

9322
09:49:16,460 --> 09:49:18,300
Hit it hard with mines and C4.

9323
09:49:18,600 --> 09:49:18,780
See?

9324
09:49:18,860 --> 09:49:19,640
I'm not crazy!

9325
09:49:21,940 --> 09:49:22,460
Okay.

9326
09:49:30,510 --> 09:49:31,390
Okay, hold on.

9327
09:49:32,490 --> 09:49:33,490
Alright, weapons.

9328
09:49:35,830 --> 09:49:36,350
Landmines.

9329
09:49:36,430 --> 09:49:39,290
I collected a good amount of those because I...

9330
09:49:39,290 --> 09:49:42,290
Metal Gear looks really like Rifleman.

9331
09:49:42,290 --> 09:49:44,890
I don't know what that is, but it sounds cool.

9332
09:49:48,710 --> 09:49:50,050
I'm just gonna keep running.

9333
09:49:56,450 --> 09:49:57,910
Okay, got one.

9334
09:50:01,170 --> 09:50:01,730
Oh, shoot.

9335
09:50:02,490 --> 09:50:03,290
Dang it, I missed.

9336
09:50:04,910 --> 09:50:05,910
Oh, I missed.

9337
09:50:06,690 --> 09:50:08,210
I'm gonna run out at this point.

9338
09:50:17,250 --> 09:50:17,810
No.

9339
09:50:20,010 --> 09:50:20,590
Dang it.

9340
09:50:21,310 --> 09:50:22,250
This is hard.

9341
09:50:31,340 --> 09:50:34,200
At least I'm not getting blown up by the...

9342
09:50:35,460 --> 09:50:36,340
Oh, come on!

9343
09:50:36,760 --> 09:50:37,500
You ass!

9344
09:50:38,060 --> 09:50:38,860
You ass!

9345
09:50:39,880 --> 09:50:40,820
You stopped!

9346
09:50:40,900 --> 09:50:41,440
You did!

9347
09:50:44,320 --> 09:50:45,060
No.

9348
09:50:45,400 --> 09:50:45,720
There.

9349
09:50:47,620 --> 09:50:47,900
Yeah.

9350
09:50:49,720 --> 09:50:51,100
Absolutely baited.

9351
09:50:54,880 --> 09:50:55,680
Yeah!

9352
09:51:00,910 --> 09:51:01,670
Ouch.

9353
09:51:02,010 --> 09:51:02,630
Ouchie ouch.

9354
09:51:03,370 --> 09:51:05,430
Snake can really take a beating, can't he?

9355
09:51:05,550 --> 09:51:06,830
I love that about...

9356
09:51:10,590 --> 09:51:12,030
Oh, classic.

9357
09:51:12,850 --> 09:51:13,770
Classic Minto.

9358
09:51:15,130 --> 09:51:15,430
No!

9359
09:51:15,890 --> 09:51:16,990
That one should've hit!

9360
09:51:26,310 --> 09:51:26,790
Thank you!

9361
09:51:28,850 --> 09:51:30,630
I'm assuming that was...

9362
09:51:31,550 --> 09:51:32,650
Phase 1.

9363
09:51:37,700 --> 09:51:39,380
Metal Gear's down?

9364
09:51:40,920 --> 09:51:42,200
You did it?

9365
09:51:43,120 --> 09:51:43,900
No.

9366
09:51:44,320 --> 09:51:45,220
Not yet.

9367
09:51:45,820 --> 09:51:47,060
It's not over yet.

9368
09:51:52,270 --> 09:51:53,530
What does that mean?

9369
09:52:00,240 --> 09:52:01,800
Hold on.

9370
09:52:02,280 --> 09:52:03,100
What does that mean?

9371
09:52:04,270 --> 09:52:05,200
Can we save?

9372
09:52:05,380 --> 09:52:06,580
I'm gonna try, actually.

9373
09:52:08,160 --> 09:52:09,820
Attack those targets.

9374
09:52:17,720 --> 09:52:20,420
I'm gonna first use a ration.

9375
09:52:24,150 --> 09:52:24,810
Nice.

9376
09:52:25,650 --> 09:52:26,270
Body armor?

9377
09:52:28,690 --> 09:52:29,710
Grenade time?

9378
09:52:29,830 --> 09:52:30,890
I think so.

9379
09:52:31,970 --> 09:52:34,530
I think it might be half time for the grenade.

9380
09:52:35,970 --> 09:52:36,630
APs!

9381
09:52:36,710 --> 09:52:37,410
Welcome to membership.

9382
09:52:37,570 --> 09:52:38,190
Thank you!

9383
09:52:39,550 --> 09:52:40,250
One second.

9384
09:52:45,880 --> 09:52:46,660
I have an itch.

9385
09:52:47,360 --> 09:52:48,020
Okay.

9386
09:52:59,590 --> 09:53:00,190
Bling!

9387
09:53:00,790 --> 09:53:03,710
I don't know if this will work, but...

9388
09:53:04,270 --> 09:53:04,690
Snake!

9389
09:53:08,150 --> 09:53:09,750
Don't let him get to you!

9390
09:53:12,080 --> 09:53:12,480
Okay.

9391
09:53:15,340 --> 09:53:15,940
Throw!

9392
09:53:17,340 --> 09:53:18,680
Oh, goodness.

9393
09:53:18,980 --> 09:53:20,220
Oh my God.

9394
09:53:22,680 --> 09:53:24,180
Where are those weak spots?

9395
09:53:24,580 --> 09:53:24,980
Oh my God.

9396
09:53:25,300 --> 09:53:25,520
Throw!

9397
09:53:26,820 --> 09:53:27,700
Come on!

9398
09:53:28,500 --> 09:53:29,740
That's so... What?

9399
09:53:30,060 --> 09:53:30,820
Weak spots?

9400
09:53:30,980 --> 09:53:31,340
How?

9401
09:53:32,040 --> 09:53:32,840
Excuse me?

9402
09:53:36,630 --> 09:53:37,330
Oh my God.

9403
09:53:37,490 --> 09:53:38,730
What the hell is that?

9404
09:53:39,090 --> 09:53:40,090
Alien creatures.

9405
09:53:41,770 --> 09:53:43,550
How the hell am I supposed to get his weak spot?

9406
09:53:43,610 --> 09:53:44,070
There we go.

9407
09:53:44,390 --> 09:53:44,670
Wait!

9408
09:53:44,730 --> 09:53:45,870
It didn't even do any damage!

9409
09:53:46,410 --> 09:53:47,190
And I'm trapped?

9410
09:53:48,310 --> 09:53:49,010
I'm sorry.

9411
09:53:49,110 --> 09:53:49,930
What is this?

9412
09:53:50,370 --> 09:53:51,650
What the hell is this?

9413
09:53:52,090 --> 09:53:53,190
Evil tops.

9414
09:53:53,190 --> 09:53:54,610
Evil tops.

9415
09:53:54,970 --> 09:53:55,530
Oh

9416
09:54:07,370 --> 09:54:10,310
my God.

9417
09:54:10,590 --> 09:54:11,670
Oh my God.

9418
09:54:11,810 --> 09:54:12,610
When is too close?

9419
09:54:12,930 --> 09:54:17,070
When do you... Sometimes he just wants to throw wherever the fuck he wants to throw.

9420
09:54:17,390 --> 09:54:18,430
Excuse me, Snake.

9421
09:54:18,710 --> 09:54:20,110
You have to be more consistent.

9422
09:54:21,310 --> 09:54:22,810
This is very upsetting.

9423
09:54:24,950 --> 09:54:27,250
This is very upsetting for me.

9424
09:54:28,770 --> 09:54:29,330
Snake!

9425
09:54:32,030 --> 09:54:33,530
Why are there tops?

9426
09:54:35,030 --> 09:54:36,490
Oh my God.

9427
09:54:36,690 --> 09:54:37,970
Why do these exist?

9428
09:54:39,030 --> 09:54:39,290
Jimmy!

9429
09:54:39,790 --> 09:54:41,410
Jimmy, I swear to God.

9430
09:54:41,670 --> 09:54:41,910
Jimmy.

9431
09:54:43,250 --> 09:54:45,230
Am I doing any damage?

9432
09:54:46,070 --> 09:54:47,830
I don't know.

9433
09:54:49,890 --> 09:54:51,470
I can't tell.

9434
09:54:53,770 --> 09:54:54,570
Drones?

9435
09:54:55,790 --> 09:54:57,610
It doesn't feel like drones.

9436
09:55:00,170 --> 09:55:02,230
Feels like evil tops.

9437
09:55:03,530 --> 09:55:05,250
Jimmy is just a child.

9438
09:55:05,570 --> 09:55:08,150
He truly was... Am I doing any damage?

9439
09:55:11,110 --> 09:55:13,750
I don't want to have to go through part one again.

9440
09:55:14,130 --> 09:55:14,930
Oh my God.

9441
09:55:16,110 --> 09:55:17,530
I don't understand this part.

9442
09:55:17,850 --> 09:55:19,150
Maybe I... Shoot.

9443
09:55:19,910 --> 09:55:20,370
Throw here.

9444
09:55:21,430 --> 09:55:24,070
I'm still throwing in the same exact spot.

9445
09:55:24,470 --> 09:55:26,670
I can't throw... It will not aim anywhere.

9446
09:55:28,470 --> 09:55:29,750
I don't know.

9447
09:55:29,750 --> 09:55:30,730
I don't know.

9448
09:55:31,290 --> 09:55:32,810
Please put me at part two.

9449
09:55:59,220 --> 09:56:00,360
You're gonna look it up?

9450
09:56:00,460 --> 09:56:00,640
Okay.

9451
09:56:01,120 --> 09:56:02,280
Look it up and let me know.

9452
09:56:03,380 --> 09:56:04,540
I don't know.

9453
09:56:06,020 --> 09:56:07,780
I'm trying my best.

9454
09:56:21,790 --> 09:56:23,890
I'm gonna need more water in a minute though.

9455
09:56:27,750 --> 09:56:28,950
Jimmy from mouthwashing?

9456
09:56:29,650 --> 09:56:32,450
I watched someone play through that recently.

9457
09:56:34,550 --> 09:56:36,670
Because I wanted to understand the hype.

9458
09:56:39,590 --> 09:56:41,890
But I didn't really feel like streaming it.

9459
09:56:44,930 --> 09:56:45,530
Okay.

9460
09:56:46,970 --> 09:56:48,770
I need more water.

9461
09:56:52,170 --> 09:56:53,250
Did I live up to the hype?

9462
09:56:53,890 --> 09:56:55,010
It was good.

9463
09:56:58,570 --> 09:57:00,410
But like... I felt...

9464
09:57:00,410 --> 09:57:02,710
Because I've seen so much about it before.

9465
09:57:03,010 --> 09:57:04,250
I felt like I already...

9466
09:57:04,970 --> 09:57:06,370
Well, I didn't know the story.

9467
09:57:06,990 --> 09:57:08,730
But I already was just like...

9468
09:57:08,730 --> 09:57:13,630
I know who to hate because of everything that I've seen on Twitter and stuff about it.

9469
09:57:13,710 --> 09:57:15,310
So I was kind of just like...

9470
09:57:15,310 --> 09:57:15,950
Oh, okay.

9471
09:57:17,730 --> 09:57:18,850
That guy sucks.

9472
09:57:18,850 --> 09:57:18,910
That guy sucks.

9473
09:57:30,150 --> 09:57:31,290
Got Jimmy spoiled?

9474
09:57:31,430 --> 09:57:32,470
Yeah, basically.

9475
09:57:33,070 --> 09:57:34,830
But I liked it.

9476
09:57:35,210 --> 09:57:38,150
I don't think... I mean, not to say like...

9477
09:57:38,150 --> 09:57:39,570
It wasn't the greatest thing.

9478
09:57:40,470 --> 09:57:43,670
Like it was still very stylistically cool and everything.

9479
09:57:45,290 --> 09:57:47,230
And Watcher, thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

9480
09:57:48,710 --> 09:57:49,630
Thank you, thank you.

9481
09:57:49,990 --> 09:57:50,790
Oh gosh, okay.

9482
09:57:53,130 --> 09:57:54,430
Oh wait, you?

9483
09:57:56,630 --> 09:57:57,150
Landmine.

9484
09:57:58,190 --> 09:58:00,070
I wish this was just the fight.

9485
09:58:01,350 --> 09:58:02,970
I wish it was just this.

9486
09:58:04,270 --> 09:58:05,590
I wish it was just this.

9487
09:58:14,010 --> 09:58:15,630
Alright, and boom.

9488
09:58:16,570 --> 09:58:18,890
Well, I still got him, I guess.

9489
09:58:24,310 --> 09:58:25,570
Not me, Snake!

9490
09:58:26,810 --> 09:58:28,250
I just wanna cry.

9491
09:58:46,220 --> 09:58:47,820
Snake, when you're so dumb...

9492
09:58:47,820 --> 09:58:49,920
Snake, it makes it really...

9493
09:58:49,920 --> 09:58:51,480
Oh my god, oh my god.

9494
09:58:52,120 --> 09:58:55,340
Wow, that was actually extremely unfair.

9495
09:58:55,800 --> 09:58:58,440
Okay, sure, sure, sure.

9496
09:59:05,740 --> 09:59:07,700
Triple fake out, yeah.

9497
09:59:08,160 --> 09:59:09,200
Like, crazy.

9498
09:59:12,670 --> 09:59:15,800
I wish also it didn't put him at full health.

9499
09:59:17,060 --> 09:59:18,620
After I did this.

9500
09:59:19,360 --> 09:59:21,580
With like the tiniest chips of health.

9501
09:59:21,660 --> 09:59:23,560
I mean, it's the final boss, what can you expect?

9502
09:59:24,220 --> 09:59:25,680
It's the final boss.

9503
09:59:27,080 --> 09:59:29,820
They gotta make it challenging, I get it.

9504
09:59:32,520 --> 09:59:33,560
I get it.

9505
09:59:33,800 --> 09:59:36,560
Yeah, I was doing some serious splits there, for real.

9506
09:59:39,560 --> 09:59:41,200
Alright, Metal Gear's down?

9507
09:59:41,320 --> 09:59:42,080
No, not yet.

9508
09:59:43,440 --> 09:59:43,960
Okay.

9509
09:59:44,860 --> 09:59:46,600
Nikita's sides and pods.

9510
09:59:46,600 --> 09:59:47,680
What's the pods?

9511
09:59:48,020 --> 09:59:48,200
The...

9512
09:59:49,360 --> 09:59:50,140
The tops?

9513
09:59:50,720 --> 09:59:51,440
Or...

9514
09:59:51,440 --> 09:59:53,460
Or those, the pods up there?

9515
10:00:06,190 --> 10:00:07,710
The backpack, okay.

9516
10:00:08,210 --> 10:00:09,690
Give me a second, guys, I need water.

9517
10:00:10,430 --> 10:00:11,150
Desperate.

9518
10:02:47,760 --> 10:02:50,200
Let's kick this guy's ass.

9519
10:02:51,880 --> 10:02:52,600
Okay.

9520
10:02:53,800 --> 10:02:54,180
Alright.

9521
10:02:56,320 --> 10:02:57,720
Okay, okay, okay.

9522
10:03:05,070 --> 10:03:05,590
Wait.

9523
10:03:07,270 --> 10:03:08,850
Where do I...

9524
10:03:10,310 --> 10:03:11,990
Where do I shoot it to?

9525
10:03:20,840 --> 10:03:21,940
Did that do it?

9526
10:03:22,440 --> 10:03:23,760
That didn't even hurt him.

9527
10:03:27,150 --> 10:03:28,750
That didn't do any damage.

9528
10:03:30,070 --> 10:03:31,590
Do I do from the back?

9529
10:03:38,170 --> 10:03:39,630
I have to go in order?

9530
10:03:40,790 --> 10:03:45,500
I have to be destroyed in order.

9531
10:03:45,740 --> 10:03:46,000
Okay.

9532
10:03:46,740 --> 10:03:47,660
Nevermind then.

9533
10:03:47,820 --> 10:03:48,100
Alright.

9534
10:03:49,900 --> 10:03:50,460
Cool.

9535
10:03:56,260 --> 10:03:56,820
Alright.

9536
10:04:01,430 --> 10:04:02,590
Grenades it is then.

9537
10:04:02,710 --> 10:04:02,970
Okay.

9538
10:04:06,170 --> 10:04:09,010
I can't get this second gun, though.

9539
10:04:09,490 --> 10:04:11,050
That's the issue for me.

9540
10:04:11,270 --> 10:04:12,430
Oh my god, please.

9541
10:04:12,430 --> 10:04:15,410
I really can't get this second gun.

9542
10:04:16,450 --> 10:04:19,150
Because I can't reach it.

9543
10:04:23,390 --> 10:04:25,770
Leave me alone, stupid tops.

9544
10:04:28,860 --> 10:04:29,320
Oh my god.

9545
10:04:30,520 --> 10:04:31,760
Like, how do I...

9546
10:04:40,010 --> 10:04:41,470
Oh, fuck you.

9547
10:04:42,050 --> 10:04:43,270
God, fuck you.

9548
10:04:43,910 --> 10:04:45,250
Said the fuck you ghost.

9549
10:04:50,830 --> 10:04:51,990
Is it dead?

9550
10:04:53,730 --> 10:04:54,410
Oh gosh.

9551
10:04:54,910 --> 10:04:56,250
Maybe from the side.

9552
10:04:57,610 --> 10:04:58,470
Okay, there we go.

9553
10:05:00,530 --> 10:05:01,790
From the side here.

9554
10:05:04,870 --> 10:05:05,470
Please.

9555
10:05:06,630 --> 10:05:07,930
Let me damage you.

9556
10:05:10,450 --> 10:05:11,310
Oh my god.

9557
10:05:11,550 --> 10:05:11,770
No!

9558
10:05:12,150 --> 10:05:13,190
No more tops!

9559
10:05:14,030 --> 10:05:14,330
Oh

9560
10:05:19,930 --> 10:05:21,090
my god.

9561
10:05:24,050 --> 10:05:25,110
Oh my god, please.

9562
10:05:25,610 --> 10:05:26,750
Please leave me alone.

9563
10:05:26,750 --> 10:05:28,750
This is so...

9564
10:05:28,750 --> 10:05:31,770
Why do they have 50 things going after me?

9565
10:05:32,270 --> 10:05:33,790
How do I know when it's dead dead?

9566
10:05:35,750 --> 10:05:36,270
Like...

9567
10:05:36,270 --> 10:05:37,470
I guess it'll be gone.

9568
10:05:37,570 --> 10:05:38,210
It'll disappear.

9569
10:05:40,290 --> 10:05:42,110
I guess it'll stop working.

9570
10:05:49,550 --> 10:05:50,470
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

9571
10:06:10,730 --> 10:06:11,250
Ouch!

9572
10:06:22,670 --> 10:06:23,190
Hit...

9573
10:06:23,190 --> 10:06:23,510
Oh.

9574
10:06:24,330 --> 10:06:26,550
No, I'm supposed to hit and dodge.

9575
10:06:27,270 --> 10:06:28,710
But the timing is...

9576
10:06:28,710 --> 10:06:31,010
Oh, you're not supposed to time...

9577
10:06:31,010 --> 10:06:32,750
You're not supposed to do that.

9578
10:06:33,250 --> 10:06:33,570
Okay.

9579
10:07:02,460 --> 10:07:03,180
Oh wait.

9580
10:07:04,760 --> 10:07:05,320
Grenades!

9581
10:07:05,460 --> 10:07:06,420
Only four though.

9582
10:07:25,630 --> 10:07:26,350
That's fine.

9583
10:07:27,470 --> 10:07:27,890
That's

9584
10:07:31,270 --> 10:07:31,750
fine.

9585
10:07:31,850 --> 10:07:32,330
That's fine.

9586
10:07:32,690 --> 10:07:33,170
That's good.

9587
10:07:36,090 --> 10:07:38,010
I wonder why the tops aren't coming out.

9588
10:07:38,350 --> 10:07:38,710
You know what?

9589
10:07:38,710 --> 10:07:39,170
That's fine.

9590
10:07:39,970 --> 10:07:41,390
I'm not gonna complain about it.

9591
10:07:43,570 --> 10:07:44,070
Ouch!

9592
10:07:44,370 --> 10:07:44,710
Oh wait!

9593
10:07:44,990 --> 10:07:45,890
Oh, I think it's dead!

9594
10:07:46,570 --> 10:07:49,190
Oh, you could've exploded or shown me or anything?

9595
10:07:49,830 --> 10:07:50,150
Why?

9596
10:07:50,290 --> 10:07:50,830
What the fuck?

9597
10:07:52,230 --> 10:07:53,710
Why didn't it, like, tell me?

9598
10:07:54,750 --> 10:07:55,550
Oh, uh...

9599
10:07:55,550 --> 10:07:55,810
Ouch!

9600
10:07:56,150 --> 10:07:56,350
Ouch!

9601
10:08:00,680 --> 10:08:02,700
Oh, what is this?

9602
10:08:15,390 --> 10:08:15,890
Okay.

9603
10:08:17,950 --> 10:08:18,450
Uh...

9604
10:08:26,430 --> 10:08:27,570
Nikita time?

9605
10:08:27,690 --> 10:08:28,730
Yeah, but...

9606
10:08:28,730 --> 10:08:29,730
Where do I stand?

9607
10:08:30,550 --> 10:08:31,650
Where do I stand?

9608
10:08:49,440 --> 10:08:51,080
I hate this.

9609
10:08:55,300 --> 10:08:56,500
No, please.

9610
10:08:57,740 --> 10:08:58,540
Please work.

9611
10:09:00,280 --> 10:09:02,060
Oh, it doesn't work anymore.

9612
10:09:14,700 --> 10:09:17,060
Everyone said it was Nikita time.

9613
10:09:17,180 --> 10:09:18,220
I just listened.

9614
10:09:34,010 --> 10:09:34,770
Oh my god.

9615
10:09:34,790 --> 10:09:35,530
Oh my god, it's this thing again.

9616
10:09:35,690 --> 10:09:36,050
Oh shit.

9617
10:09:36,670 --> 10:09:42,890
Oh my god.

9618
10:09:47,030 --> 10:09:48,970
I think I'm out of...

9619
10:09:51,550 --> 10:09:52,970
Yeah, I'm out of...

9620
10:09:54,170 --> 10:09:54,650
Rations.

9621
10:09:54,650 --> 10:09:54,810
Rations?

9622
10:10:01,340 --> 10:10:02,660
I don't know where to run!

9623
10:10:03,340 --> 10:10:04,120
I'm scared.

9624
10:10:05,140 --> 10:10:06,340
This one's so scary.

9625
10:10:07,100 --> 10:10:07,980
Oh, what the hell?

9626
10:10:08,760 --> 10:10:09,840
That was my last grenade.

9627
10:10:10,440 --> 10:10:10,880
Please.

9628
10:10:11,520 --> 10:10:11,880
What?

9629
10:10:11,960 --> 10:10:12,720
They're both working?

9630
10:10:13,360 --> 10:10:14,220
No, no.

9631
10:10:14,540 --> 10:10:16,280
Wait, this doesn't make any sense!

9632
10:10:49,460 --> 10:10:50,700
Fuck, it's this thing again.

9633
10:10:56,270 --> 10:10:56,950
Oh my god.

9634
10:10:57,610 --> 10:10:58,050
I

9635
10:11:01,430 --> 10:11:02,830
can't tell when this is...

9636
10:11:02,830 --> 10:11:03,390
Oh my god.

9637
10:11:03,830 --> 10:11:04,710
Opened up, you know?

9638
10:11:04,710 --> 10:11:06,030
So it's like...

9639
10:11:06,030 --> 10:11:07,960
I have to hear it and it's...

9640
10:11:08,710 --> 10:11:10,050
And then I'm scared.

9641
10:11:10,530 --> 10:11:13,110
I'm scared to do this and...

9642
10:11:13,110 --> 10:11:13,970
Miss.

9643
10:11:14,190 --> 10:11:15,670
Oh, I need to be back further.

9644
10:11:15,870 --> 10:11:17,750
Oh god, no, I'm gonna miss my chance!

9645
10:11:22,150 --> 10:11:23,130
Oh my god.

9646
10:11:24,530 --> 10:11:25,430
How the hell?

9647
10:11:26,650 --> 10:11:27,930
How the hell?

9648
10:11:33,020 --> 10:11:33,740
Oh god.

9649
10:11:33,740 --> 10:11:37,740
Oh, well, that doesn't work anymore, I guess.

9650
10:11:37,900 --> 10:11:40,240
It doesn't...

9651
10:11:40,240 --> 10:11:40,660
Okay.

9652
10:11:41,180 --> 10:11:41,740
Oh, shit.

9653
10:11:41,920 --> 10:11:42,620
Oh shit, there we go.

9654
10:11:43,300 --> 10:11:43,680
There we go.

9655
10:11:46,250 --> 10:11:47,110
Ouch, ouch.

9656
10:11:47,710 --> 10:11:48,230
Bitch.

9657
10:11:48,550 --> 10:11:48,910
Bitch!

9658
10:11:49,170 --> 10:11:49,630
Fuck you!

9659
10:11:49,890 --> 10:11:50,590
I'm empty!

9660
10:11:51,110 --> 10:11:52,270
I fucking ate you!

9661
10:11:52,750 --> 10:11:53,410
Fuck you!

9662
10:12:01,130 --> 10:12:04,010
Oh my god, I got stuck on the fucking rock!

9663
10:12:07,630 --> 10:12:07,830
No!

9664
10:12:08,630 --> 10:12:09,570
What is this?

9665
10:12:10,010 --> 10:12:11,130
What is this?

9666
10:12:11,430 --> 10:12:12,230
Oh, fuck it.

9667
10:12:12,470 --> 10:12:12,970
Fuck me.

9668
10:12:13,170 --> 10:12:13,810
Fuck me.

9669
10:12:14,250 --> 10:12:15,150
This sucks.

9670
10:12:15,690 --> 10:12:16,810
This sucks.

9671
10:12:16,930 --> 10:12:17,510
This sucks.

9672
10:12:17,650 --> 10:12:18,190
This sucks.

9673
10:12:18,310 --> 10:12:18,750
This sucks.

9674
10:12:18,870 --> 10:12:19,850
This sucks.

9675
10:12:22,910 --> 10:12:23,790
This is...

9676
10:12:23,790 --> 10:12:24,750
This is...

9677
10:12:24,750 --> 10:12:26,210
This is awful.

9678
10:12:26,590 --> 10:12:27,330
This is awful!

9679
10:12:29,670 --> 10:12:30,210
Okay.

9680
10:12:30,430 --> 10:12:31,730
Okay, I'm just gonna...

9681
10:12:31,730 --> 10:12:32,790
Calm down.

9682
10:12:32,930 --> 10:12:33,950
I'm gonna concentrate.

9683
10:12:35,170 --> 10:12:37,950
I am concentrating, but it's...

9684
10:12:42,770 --> 10:12:44,010
Oh, I have one more.

9685
10:12:45,790 --> 10:12:46,030
Okay.

9686
10:12:48,030 --> 10:12:48,670
Weapon.

9687
10:12:48,890 --> 10:12:49,270
Change.

9688
10:12:49,570 --> 10:12:49,770
To.

9689
10:12:50,150 --> 10:12:50,470
Nikita.

9690
10:12:50,950 --> 10:12:51,130
And.

9691
10:12:51,930 --> 10:12:52,310
Shoot.

9692
10:12:52,670 --> 10:12:53,650
Where is the Nikita?

9693
10:12:55,070 --> 10:12:55,710
Shoot!

9694
10:12:56,410 --> 10:12:58,070
I think I missed my chance.

9695
10:12:58,210 --> 10:12:58,430
Yep.

9696
10:12:58,750 --> 10:12:59,830
That's so...

9697
10:13:01,230 --> 10:13:02,310
That's not nice.

9698
10:13:02,370 --> 10:13:03,370
I don't like...

9699
10:13:06,270 --> 10:13:06,970
Oh, shit.

9700
10:13:07,350 --> 10:13:08,050
I'm gonna die.

9701
10:13:08,250 --> 10:13:08,750
I'm not gonna...

9702
10:13:08,750 --> 10:13:10,090
This isn't the ride, you guys.

9703
10:13:11,850 --> 10:13:12,210
How

9704
10:13:59,270 --> 10:14:01,730
am I supposed to...

9705
10:14:59,320 --> 10:14:59,760
Sorry,

9706
10:15:05,800 --> 10:15:06,040
guys.

9707
10:15:06,040 --> 10:15:08,080
I'm not talking much because my throat hurts.

9708
10:15:14,470 --> 10:15:15,890
This thing in the back is working.

9709
10:15:17,210 --> 10:15:18,290
Wait, it is working?

9710
10:15:20,550 --> 10:15:21,750
The health is going down.

9711
10:15:21,850 --> 10:15:23,570
It doesn't give you a good visual indication.

9712
10:15:24,450 --> 10:15:25,450
Oh, so it is working.

9713
10:15:27,330 --> 10:15:29,330
In general or only when it's open?

9714
10:15:33,890 --> 10:15:35,210
You did a lot of damage.

9715
10:15:35,290 --> 10:15:36,510
Yeah, we got really far.

9716
10:15:53,530 --> 10:15:54,870
That was my phone.

9717
10:16:03,690 --> 10:16:06,530
I don't know when I'm hitting it right though.

9718
10:16:08,130 --> 10:16:10,730
I don't know if I'm hitting it correctly though.

9719
10:16:13,230 --> 10:16:15,130
I still can't tell.

9720
10:16:20,300 --> 10:16:23,340
I can't get the timing right on the back missiles, you know.

9721
10:16:35,850 --> 10:16:41,810
I have to get far away from it so it doesn't do its stupid flamethrower.

9722
10:16:44,290 --> 10:16:46,250
You got me through a very difficult day today.

9723
10:16:47,810 --> 10:16:49,030
I'm glad.

9724
10:16:50,690 --> 10:16:57,010
I hope that works.

9725
10:17:09,140 --> 10:17:10,100
Steppy!

9726
10:17:10,500 --> 10:17:10,940
Steppy!

9727
10:17:11,460 --> 10:17:12,000
Steppy!

9728
10:17:12,560 --> 10:17:12,860
Steppy!

9729
10:17:14,100 --> 10:17:14,980
Nice save.

9730
10:17:17,140 --> 10:17:17,620
Oh,

9731
10:17:21,680 --> 10:17:22,440
come on.

9732
10:17:22,660 --> 10:17:23,420
What the...

9733
10:17:23,420 --> 10:17:25,780
You came down faster than you normally do.

9734
10:17:26,780 --> 10:17:27,740
Unfair.

9735
10:17:27,740 --> 10:17:32,140
See, look how much time he usually gives and with that one he came down immediately.

9736
10:17:33,920 --> 10:17:34,400
Bitch.

9737
10:17:35,140 --> 10:17:37,740
Fuck you Metal Gear whatever your name is.

9738
10:17:38,340 --> 10:17:40,460
Nobody calls you by your Metal Gear name though.

9739
10:17:40,560 --> 10:17:42,860
Everybody just calls you Metal Gear because everyone hates you.

9740
10:17:43,240 --> 10:17:45,140
They hate you enough to erase your identity.

9741
10:17:45,380 --> 10:17:45,880
That was too slow.

9742
10:17:48,460 --> 10:17:50,820
It looks like Snake has a little cat tail, doesn't it?

9743
10:17:50,860 --> 10:17:51,780
Sorry, I'm...

9744
10:17:51,780 --> 10:17:53,820
I'm getting... I'm missing these.

9745
10:17:53,980 --> 10:17:55,580
I'm missing these, so I'm...

9746
10:18:14,560 --> 10:18:16,180
Oh, I got hit twice though.

9747
10:18:19,310 --> 10:18:21,150
I got hit twice though.

9748
10:18:25,010 --> 10:18:26,570
I don't think this is the run.

9749
10:18:34,770 --> 10:18:35,650
That's stupid.

9750
10:18:37,210 --> 10:18:40,090
I don't even know how to hit those other... The circle-y guys.

9751
10:18:41,250 --> 10:18:42,850
I don't know how to hit those at all.

9752
10:18:43,690 --> 10:18:45,190
Like, I think it's actually impossible.

9753
10:18:48,510 --> 10:18:49,730
I have no idea.

9754
10:18:53,290 --> 10:18:54,790
You hit them at an angle.

9755
10:18:55,130 --> 10:18:56,210
Aw, that's hard.

9756
10:18:56,670 --> 10:18:59,530
Why am I at... Why did I have my card healed?

9757
10:19:10,110 --> 10:19:11,870
Go in the armpit and angle it.

9758
10:19:16,230 --> 10:19:18,070
I want the tops to not come out.

9759
10:19:18,210 --> 10:19:18,430
Wait!

9760
10:19:18,630 --> 10:19:18,870
Oh.

9761
10:19:19,350 --> 10:19:20,570
I just hurt myself.

9762
10:19:26,690 --> 10:19:31,050
Oh, did that do any damage?

9763
10:19:31,050 --> 10:19:32,070
Nope, of course not.

9764
10:19:33,150 --> 10:19:35,250
That would be too easy.

9765
10:19:35,430 --> 10:19:36,230
Oh, the tops!

9766
10:19:36,690 --> 10:19:37,690
Oh, the tops.

9767
10:19:38,070 --> 10:19:40,050
I think the tops...

9768
10:19:41,910 --> 10:19:44,050
Stop once you...

9769
10:19:44,630 --> 10:19:45,750
Oh my god, please.

9770
10:19:46,630 --> 10:19:48,110
I can't move with you.

9771
10:19:48,230 --> 10:19:49,690
I can't work under these conditions.

9772
10:19:52,350 --> 10:19:53,850
I'm just gonna keep doing this.

9773
10:19:54,170 --> 10:19:54,810
And chip away.

9774
10:19:55,530 --> 10:19:57,470
I'm just gonna keep doing this and chip away.

9775
10:19:58,210 --> 10:19:59,790
And the tops will maybe come down.

9776
10:20:01,990 --> 10:20:02,970
Oh, fuck me.

9777
10:20:03,190 --> 10:20:03,870
Fuck you.

9778
10:20:04,410 --> 10:20:05,170
Fuck this game.

9779
10:20:05,510 --> 10:20:06,330
Fuck this boss.

9780
10:20:08,750 --> 10:20:09,750
Oh my god, ouch.

9781
10:20:11,110 --> 10:20:12,810
Everything moves so fast.

9782
10:20:13,490 --> 10:20:17,590
Oh my god, there's no way to dodge when you get stuck on the things.

9783
10:20:19,050 --> 10:20:20,590
It moves too fast.

9784
10:20:23,670 --> 10:20:26,970
You just have to be... You just have to hope you're not in its line of sight.

9785
10:20:27,110 --> 10:20:27,730
Oh my god.

9786
10:20:57,330 --> 10:20:59,070
Asshole, asshole, asshole.

9787
10:21:02,310 --> 10:21:05,010
And I get stuck on these fucking boxes.

9788
10:21:12,000 --> 10:21:14,880
The hitboxes, I don't understand the hitbox at all.

9789
10:21:15,080 --> 10:21:18,740
Because I truly... I don't understand it.

9790
10:21:21,620 --> 10:21:23,960
Okay, I'm gonna need to go get more sand.

9791
10:21:26,980 --> 10:21:32,300
And I'm gonna just use my... I'm just gonna use this while I have it.

9792
10:21:34,840 --> 10:21:36,940
Can you imagine if I didn't have the body armor?

9793
10:21:37,640 --> 10:21:42,240
If I hadn't gotten that, I don't think I would have been able to survive any of these.

9794
10:21:45,440 --> 10:21:49,960
It would literally be like, get good or you'll never...

9795
10:21:51,240 --> 10:21:52,160
Oh my god, come on.

9796
10:21:52,160 --> 10:21:53,300
No, no.

9797
10:21:54,360 --> 10:21:56,080
Wait, why... Oh, there.

9798
10:21:56,700 --> 10:21:59,780
If I could just see where the boxes are.

9799
10:22:06,890 --> 10:22:07,990
Oh my god.

9800
10:22:08,710 --> 10:22:09,870
Thanks for the warning.

9801
10:22:10,330 --> 10:22:11,570
This guy is such an ass.

9802
10:22:12,590 --> 10:22:13,350
I hate you.

9803
10:22:13,710 --> 10:22:14,370
I hate you.

9804
10:22:15,830 --> 10:22:16,870
Oh my god.

9805
10:22:19,430 --> 10:22:24,410
Why are they always random too?

9806
10:22:25,430 --> 10:22:29,730
Like, the way these fire are random, so I can't, like... I can't, like...

9807
10:22:29,730 --> 10:22:31,710
Detect what pattern it's gonna be.

9808
10:22:35,310 --> 10:22:36,870
There's no warning sign.

9809
10:22:36,950 --> 10:22:37,430
There's nothing.

9810
10:22:38,230 --> 10:22:40,350
It's like I said with the walls and everything.

9811
10:22:40,590 --> 10:22:42,450
Like, you have to... Okay, okay.

9812
10:22:42,870 --> 10:22:46,510
You have to be able to, like...

9813
10:22:46,510 --> 10:22:50,690
Let the player have some sort of indication of something.

9814
10:22:50,790 --> 10:22:51,970
There's no rhyme or reason.

9815
10:22:59,120 --> 10:23:01,140
No, I'm not talking about when it fires.

9816
10:23:01,240 --> 10:23:02,780
And it's not always when it shoots.

9817
10:23:02,940 --> 10:23:05,820
It just kind of go... Like, it's not always when I hit the gun.

9818
10:23:06,580 --> 10:23:08,000
Because sometimes it just goes.

9819
10:23:08,120 --> 10:23:08,600
Like now.

9820
10:23:08,800 --> 10:23:08,960
See?

9821
10:23:09,100 --> 10:23:11,460
I didn't hit the gun and it just decided to fire.

9822
10:23:13,380 --> 10:23:14,820
I didn't hit the gun there though.

9823
10:23:14,900 --> 10:23:15,920
And it decided to fire.

9824
10:23:16,120 --> 10:23:17,020
Oh my god.

9825
10:23:17,300 --> 10:23:18,880
I'm talking about though its pattern.

9826
10:23:20,540 --> 10:23:21,920
Its specific shot pattern.

9827
10:23:22,040 --> 10:23:22,700
Yeah, exactly.

9828
10:23:22,700 --> 10:23:22,860
Exactly.

9829
10:23:31,870 --> 10:23:33,610
Because it's very fast.

9830
10:23:34,350 --> 10:23:35,150
And then also, see?

9831
10:23:35,610 --> 10:23:36,250
Like...

9832
10:23:37,110 --> 10:23:38,330
It's fucking ridiculous.

9833
10:23:42,410 --> 10:23:44,930
There is no pattern and that's what makes it so difficult.

9834
10:23:47,250 --> 10:23:48,530
I can't.

9835
10:23:48,530 --> 10:23:49,630
I can't with this thing.

9836
10:23:50,050 --> 10:23:50,810
Oh my god.

9837
10:23:53,290 --> 10:23:53,930
Please.

9838
10:24:01,770 --> 10:24:03,010
Stuck on the box.

9839
10:24:07,750 --> 10:24:08,550
Oh god.

9840
10:24:10,470 --> 10:24:10,870
Oh

9841
10:24:26,060 --> 10:24:26,460
my...

9842
10:24:26,460 --> 10:24:28,180
Oh, what's the point?

9843
10:24:28,400 --> 10:24:29,400
What is the point of anything?

9844
10:24:31,380 --> 10:24:33,120
What's the point of anything anymore?

9845
10:24:42,840 --> 10:24:44,200
Imagine if there were a part...

9846
10:25:00,340 --> 10:25:01,100
This is it.

9847
10:25:01,180 --> 10:25:02,780
This is it for me, guys.

9848
10:25:06,920 --> 10:25:08,060
Oh, it does do damage.

9849
10:25:08,100 --> 10:25:08,620
I see it.

9850
10:25:09,540 --> 10:25:09,840
Please.

9851
10:25:10,220 --> 10:25:10,940
Oh god.

9852
10:25:10,940 --> 10:25:13,560
Let me

9853
10:25:19,060 --> 10:25:19,440
try...

9854
10:25:37,480 --> 10:25:39,660
I'm just waiting for it to launch more.

9855
10:25:43,440 --> 10:25:45,600
I'll just wait here until it launches another.

9856
10:25:46,940 --> 10:25:48,620
I know it's not damaging you guys.

9857
10:25:48,680 --> 10:25:49,980
I'm not fucking dumb, okay?

9858
10:26:16,130 --> 10:26:17,430
Is there anything over here?

9859
10:26:17,590 --> 10:26:17,710
No.

9860
10:26:30,280 --> 10:26:33,140
I think if I just stand there though...

9861
10:26:33,140 --> 10:26:34,900
The bullets can't hit me.

9862
10:26:36,000 --> 10:26:37,840
It'll just be hard to dodge the missiles.

9863
10:26:39,620 --> 10:26:41,740
But I think that might be the best strat.

9864
10:26:43,200 --> 10:26:44,980
At least let me just try it.

9865
10:26:46,760 --> 10:26:48,500
I just have to dodge the missiles.

9866
10:26:48,740 --> 10:26:49,920
I wait for it to open up.

9867
10:26:50,440 --> 10:26:50,940
I shoot.

9868
10:26:51,200 --> 10:26:52,020
Dodge missiles.

9869
10:26:53,160 --> 10:26:54,900
Keep waiting for it to open up.

9870
10:26:55,540 --> 10:26:56,000
Shoot.

9871
10:26:56,400 --> 10:26:56,960
Dodge missiles.

9872
10:26:59,500 --> 10:27:01,040
I think it's all I can do.

9873
10:27:06,590 --> 10:27:08,410
You can see the missiles on the mini-map.

9874
10:27:08,670 --> 10:27:09,070
You can?

9875
10:27:09,070 --> 10:27:10,790
I had no idea.

9876
10:27:10,950 --> 10:27:11,470
Thank you.

9877
10:27:13,130 --> 10:27:14,270
And look at the membership.

9878
10:27:14,430 --> 10:27:15,070
Thank you.

9879
10:27:28,330 --> 10:27:29,910
Shut up, colonel.

9880
10:27:29,970 --> 10:27:30,750
I don't care.

9881
10:27:50,520 --> 10:27:53,300
Run away far, far from the Metal Gear.

9882
10:27:55,420 --> 10:27:57,080
Try not to get hit.

9883
10:28:01,220 --> 10:28:01,780
Nice.

9884
10:28:06,210 --> 10:28:08,150
He was fast there.

9885
10:28:08,350 --> 10:28:09,730
It was fast on that one.

9886
10:28:25,070 --> 10:28:26,630
Splash like a bitch.

9887
10:28:30,410 --> 10:28:30,970
Nice.

9888
10:28:31,570 --> 10:28:32,590
That was like right in the middle.

9889
10:28:34,070 --> 10:28:34,970
Big damage.

9890
10:28:35,170 --> 10:28:37,590
If only it mattered in phase 2.

9891
10:28:39,690 --> 10:28:42,030
I had a feeling it was going to be a fake out.

9892
10:28:44,330 --> 10:28:46,470
That's what stepping on Legos feels like.

9893
10:28:46,510 --> 10:28:48,410
Yeah, step on my Legos.

9894
10:28:51,250 --> 10:28:53,250
Step on my Legos.

9895
10:28:53,570 --> 10:28:54,670
Step on them.

9896
10:28:54,810 --> 10:28:56,250
I'm glad I didn't go for that one.

9897
10:28:57,410 --> 10:28:59,290
Step on my Legos.

9898
10:29:00,550 --> 10:29:01,870
Step on them.

9899
10:29:05,010 --> 10:29:06,210
No hit.

9900
10:29:10,630 --> 10:29:13,430
Okay, I almost spilled my water everywhere.

9901
10:29:19,030 --> 10:29:19,450
Okay.

9902
10:29:20,390 --> 10:29:21,590
Put my drink down.

9903
10:29:30,090 --> 10:29:32,790
You know what the final icing on the cake is going to be?

9904
10:29:32,990 --> 10:29:36,230
I'm going to get to the stage clear and it's just going to say, terrible.

9905
10:29:36,230 --> 10:29:36,330
Terrible.

9906
10:29:38,530 --> 10:29:43,590
I'm going to get to the stage clear and it will be like, wow, horrible job.

9907
10:29:46,810 --> 10:29:48,390
I can't wait.

9908
10:29:49,410 --> 10:29:50,570
Oh my gosh, the tops.

9909
10:29:54,010 --> 10:29:54,990
Oh my gosh.

9910
10:29:56,870 --> 10:29:58,150
Oh my gosh.

9911
10:29:58,510 --> 10:29:59,190
And throw.

9912
10:30:03,300 --> 10:30:03,980
Throw.

9913
10:30:04,760 --> 10:30:05,540
Oh, the tops.

9914
10:30:08,080 --> 10:30:08,740
The tops.

9915
10:30:11,360 --> 10:30:15,300
Have you guys seen that animal, like the heel...

9916
10:30:15,940 --> 10:30:18,080
Crux, whatever it's called, and it goes...

9917
10:30:22,100 --> 10:30:22,760
Stop it!

9918
10:30:23,020 --> 10:30:23,420
Stop it!

9919
10:30:23,560 --> 10:30:24,080
Leave me alone!

9920
10:30:24,580 --> 10:30:25,220
Leave me alone!

9921
10:30:46,520 --> 10:30:47,400
That was close.

9922
10:30:54,070 --> 10:30:54,790
Oh my god.

9923
10:30:58,050 --> 10:31:00,670
At least touching them doesn't do anything, it seems.

9924
10:31:01,510 --> 10:31:02,470
It's just...

9925
10:31:02,470 --> 10:31:03,410
Oh, that was close.

9926
10:31:18,720 --> 10:31:19,840
Oh shit.

9927
10:31:33,660 --> 10:31:35,520
Nice dodge, nice dodge.

9928
10:31:36,600 --> 10:31:38,060
Oh, not dodge there.

9929
10:31:40,260 --> 10:31:41,960
Please, no more tops.

9930
10:31:42,960 --> 10:31:43,340
Oh my god.

9931
10:31:53,980 --> 10:31:56,260
I can't tell what's going to hit me.

9932
10:31:56,480 --> 10:31:57,140
Is it the guns?

9933
10:31:57,440 --> 10:31:58,220
Is it the tops?

9934
10:31:58,220 --> 10:31:59,760
Is it the things up there?

9935
10:32:00,080 --> 10:32:03,420
Like, holy hell, there's just so much shooting at me.

9936
10:32:03,540 --> 10:32:04,640
At all times.

9937
10:32:06,240 --> 10:32:06,720
Please.

9938
10:32:11,580 --> 10:32:14,440
Oh my gosh, I just ran right into it because...

9939
10:32:14,440 --> 10:32:18,480
How the fuck was I supposed to know where you're gonna spawn your satans?

9940
10:32:18,560 --> 10:32:19,580
I don't fucking know.

9941
10:32:20,140 --> 10:32:20,720
I don't know.

9942
10:32:20,800 --> 10:32:21,140
Oh my god.

9943
10:32:23,520 --> 10:32:24,000
No!

9944
10:32:24,340 --> 10:32:24,800
I'm out!

9945
10:32:25,180 --> 10:32:25,500
No!

9946
10:32:25,780 --> 10:32:26,680
You could've told me!

9947
10:32:51,350 --> 10:32:54,350
Okay, getting close there, so...

9948
10:32:55,590 --> 10:32:56,990
Let's use this.

9949
10:33:04,830 --> 10:33:05,530
That's...

9950
10:33:06,340 --> 10:33:08,090
I can't throw diagonally.

9951
10:33:08,290 --> 10:33:12,430
I'm not good at it, so I'm not going to attempt, honestly.

9952
10:33:13,910 --> 10:33:15,210
Oh my god, please!

9953
10:33:15,210 --> 10:33:15,530
Jesus!

9954
10:33:17,190 --> 10:33:17,770
God,

9955
10:33:24,020 --> 10:33:26,960
you don't give me any chance to dodge!

9956
10:33:30,950 --> 10:33:32,100
Oh my god.

9957
10:33:32,780 --> 10:33:33,680
Oh my god.

9958
10:33:34,660 --> 10:33:35,940
They just turn on me.

9959
10:33:42,920 --> 10:33:44,820
Sometimes the guns work and sometimes...

9960
10:33:47,340 --> 10:33:49,300
Okay, I see what you mean.

9961
10:33:50,060 --> 10:33:50,660
What is...

9962
10:33:51,740 --> 10:33:54,580
Oh god, I can't look at the radar.

9963
10:33:55,040 --> 10:33:57,280
My self is too huge.

9964
10:33:57,920 --> 10:33:59,300
I can't look at the radar.

9965
10:33:59,300 --> 10:34:00,300
No, no, no, no.

9966
10:34:00,940 --> 10:34:01,160
No.

9967
10:34:02,360 --> 10:34:07,180
My box is too big and I can't tell where I am and versus and stuff.

9968
10:34:07,700 --> 10:34:08,280
Amanda!

9969
10:34:23,360 --> 10:34:25,420
That's the MGS Con boss!

9970
10:34:25,880 --> 10:34:27,300
Oh gosh, don't be here.

9971
10:34:29,100 --> 10:34:30,580
I'm being descended into madness.

9972
10:34:39,040 --> 10:34:41,220
Please, don't watch this.

9973
10:34:43,900 --> 10:34:44,920
Oh, shoot.

9974
10:34:51,880 --> 10:34:54,660
Yeah, I can't look at it.

9975
10:34:57,280 --> 10:34:59,020
Oh wow, okay.

9976
10:35:06,600 --> 10:35:08,060
I don't know if that...

9977
10:35:36,170 --> 10:35:38,870
Guys, I'm just...

9978
10:35:39,550 --> 10:35:41,270
I don't know anymore.

9979
10:35:44,730 --> 10:35:46,100
I'm just gonna...

9980
10:36:06,890 --> 10:36:10,450
There's nowhere that is safe to stand.

9981
10:36:10,450 --> 10:36:12,330
Oh, fuck me.

9982
10:36:17,850 --> 10:36:18,830
Thank you, Tim!

9983
10:36:19,330 --> 10:36:23,470
You guys know that you're super chatting, but I'm just gonna send it back to the Kickstarter.

9984
10:36:25,070 --> 10:36:26,390
But thank you!

9985
10:36:56,690 --> 10:36:58,070
We got it halfway.

9986
10:36:59,650 --> 10:37:00,710
Only halfway.

9987
10:37:08,760 --> 10:37:11,860
I know that area is really tight for dodging, but...

9988
10:37:11,860 --> 10:37:14,480
I don't feel safe standing anywhere else.

9989
10:37:38,620 --> 10:37:41,480
Why hit harder spot than easy spot?

9990
10:37:42,360 --> 10:37:44,360
It's just different slightly damage.

9991
10:37:46,940 --> 10:37:49,880
Because the missiles are gonna come otherwise.

9992
10:37:50,580 --> 10:37:55,120
And I can avoid all the other attacks and hopefully avoid the missiles.

9993
10:37:57,000 --> 10:38:02,740
Or, I can be hit by the missiles and the other attacks.

9994
10:38:09,110 --> 10:38:10,370
That's why.

9995
10:38:51,840 --> 10:38:52,320
Nevermind.

9996
10:38:52,800 --> 10:38:53,140
Faded.

9997
10:38:53,840 --> 10:38:55,180
God, you're such a little bitch.

9998
10:39:05,370 --> 10:39:06,010
I'm gonna restart.

9999
10:39:09,530 --> 10:39:10,710
I'm gonna restart.

10000
10:39:10,710 --> 10:39:10,990
Restart.

10001
10:39:23,390 --> 10:39:24,830
Oh, there's stuff down here too.

10002
10:39:25,370 --> 10:39:25,970
There's more grenades.

10003
10:40:21,200 --> 10:40:21,640
Okay.

10004
10:40:37,300 --> 10:40:38,940
Save right before the boss stage?

10005
10:40:39,000 --> 10:40:39,440
I did.

10006
10:40:39,980 --> 10:40:43,020
I've done that before and it still makes me pick up everything.

10007
10:41:10,890 --> 10:41:11,890
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

10008
10:41:14,610 --> 10:41:17,350
I just got my landmarks.

10009
10:41:21,910 --> 10:41:23,730
No way, I look like a little monkey.

10010
10:41:24,410 --> 10:41:25,850
You can see my big ol' ears.

10011
10:41:26,910 --> 10:41:32,670
My big ol' ears on the side and my little monkey tail and my little monkey nose and my little monkey legs.

10012
10:41:33,810 --> 10:41:34,530
Are you gonna bait me?

10013
10:41:35,130 --> 10:41:35,450
Yep.

10014
10:41:37,290 --> 10:41:38,530
I know you're gimme.

10015
10:41:40,850 --> 10:41:41,990
Thank you, thank you.

10016
10:41:43,310 --> 10:41:45,230
Okay, alright, alright.

10017
10:41:45,650 --> 10:41:47,210
I can... I will...

10018
10:41:48,370 --> 10:41:49,010
Do...

10019
10:41:49,010 --> 10:41:49,550
Now.

10020
10:41:51,850 --> 10:41:54,890
Sometimes I wish I just could keep running and running and running.

10021
10:41:57,190 --> 10:42:00,110
And that I don't have to lay anything down.

10022
10:42:01,390 --> 10:42:03,290
Just run away from my problems.

10023
10:42:03,590 --> 10:42:04,810
Oh, you...

10024
10:42:04,810 --> 10:42:06,190
You ass.

10025
10:42:07,070 --> 10:42:08,910
Customer Johnson, thanks for the birthday gift!

10026
10:42:09,390 --> 10:42:10,410
Thank you!

10027
10:42:11,270 --> 10:42:11,710
Okay.

10028
10:42:14,210 --> 10:42:14,690
Yes.

10029
10:42:17,890 --> 10:42:19,250
Run, run, run.

10030
10:42:19,410 --> 10:42:20,110
You still going?

10031
10:42:20,630 --> 10:42:24,210
Yeah, I thought this was gonna be a faster stream than it really turned into.

10032
10:42:31,690 --> 10:42:33,290
It is what it is.

10033
10:42:33,330 --> 10:42:36,690
Hopefully I can beat it within an hour so that I can go to bed and...

10034
10:42:37,210 --> 10:42:37,830
Oh, you...

10035
10:42:38,630 --> 10:42:39,110
You...

10036
10:42:39,630 --> 10:42:42,870
And also not have to make a separate bit of offer.

10037
10:42:42,870 --> 10:42:43,610
For...

10038
10:43:07,140 --> 10:43:09,500
Phase two is time consuming.

10039
10:43:09,640 --> 10:43:10,460
It is.

10040
10:43:12,520 --> 10:43:13,900
It is.

10041
10:43:14,340 --> 10:43:16,040
We've only done it a couple times.

10042
10:43:18,980 --> 10:43:19,330
So...

10043
10:43:26,640 --> 10:43:29,820
I saw some people saying that, like...

10044
10:43:29,820 --> 10:43:32,940
The game forces you to hit everything on it.

10045
10:43:33,660 --> 10:43:36,520
But I don't think that's the case.

10046
10:43:36,520 --> 10:43:40,760
What, does the health just stop dropping if you start attacking...

10047
10:43:40,760 --> 10:43:42,060
If you only attack one thing?

10048
10:43:42,120 --> 10:43:43,700
I feel like that's not really the case.

10049
10:43:46,620 --> 10:43:48,420
I don't think that's really the case.

10050
10:43:51,740 --> 10:43:52,200
Okay.

10051
10:43:55,970 --> 10:43:56,770
Believe in yourself.

10052
10:43:56,890 --> 10:43:58,230
In the minky that believes in you.

10053
10:44:01,290 --> 10:44:04,490
Defeating the circle turrets is good because they stop shooting at you.

10054
10:44:05,110 --> 10:44:06,510
But they're so hard to hit!

10055
10:44:09,490 --> 10:44:10,490
But also...

10056
10:44:14,030 --> 10:44:14,530
Also...

10057
10:44:14,530 --> 10:44:16,390
They regenerate, so it doesn't matter.

10058
10:44:19,010 --> 10:44:20,010
They regenerate.

10059
10:44:22,550 --> 10:44:24,170
Stand next to them and aim sideways.

10060
10:44:24,330 --> 10:44:24,670
No, no!

10061
10:44:24,990 --> 10:44:27,090
I end up getting hit.

10062
10:44:28,470 --> 10:44:30,410
The circle turrets don't regenerate?

10063
10:44:30,850 --> 10:44:31,770
No way.

10064
10:44:32,870 --> 10:44:34,270
Okay, that's big news.

10065
10:44:34,370 --> 10:44:35,590
Okay, let's go try it.

10066
10:44:37,170 --> 10:44:39,410
Okay, aim diagonal.

10067
10:44:41,070 --> 10:44:41,770
Sideways.

10068
10:44:42,370 --> 10:44:42,550
See?

10069
10:44:43,290 --> 10:44:44,150
This is why.

10070
10:44:48,270 --> 10:44:48,970
Sideways.

10071
10:44:55,960 --> 10:44:59,220
Like, you can't stand diagonally, which is the issue.

10072
10:44:59,560 --> 10:44:59,700
Okay.

10073
10:45:03,000 --> 10:45:04,780
No, leave me alone!

10074
10:45:05,140 --> 10:45:05,840
Leave me alone!

10075
10:45:06,960 --> 10:45:08,600
Maybe they are leaving me alone.

10076
10:45:09,500 --> 10:45:10,900
Is this the strat?

10077
10:45:11,300 --> 10:45:11,860
Do nothing?

10078
10:45:14,300 --> 10:45:17,260
The strat is... do nothing.

10079
10:45:19,420 --> 10:45:20,100
See?

10080
10:45:20,160 --> 10:45:21,240
I can't hit them.

10081
10:45:21,680 --> 10:45:23,320
I don't know how, you guys.

10082
10:45:23,460 --> 10:45:25,100
I do try.

10083
10:45:25,280 --> 10:45:26,960
I am legitimately...

10084
10:45:26,960 --> 10:45:27,880
Oh my god!

10085
10:45:28,220 --> 10:45:28,880
It worked!

10086
10:45:32,820 --> 10:45:34,700
But I have to...

10087
10:45:35,440 --> 10:45:35,740
Yeah!

10088
10:45:41,450 --> 10:45:42,050
Ouch.

10089
10:45:42,390 --> 10:45:42,790
Open.

10090
10:45:43,570 --> 10:45:44,590
Open wide.

10091
10:45:45,030 --> 10:45:46,090
Open up.

10092
10:45:46,730 --> 10:45:48,730
Here comes the grenade.

10093
10:45:50,730 --> 10:45:51,030
Open.

10094
10:45:51,730 --> 10:45:54,730
Ah, bad.

10095
10:45:55,250 --> 10:45:56,490
I wonder how we know when...

10096
10:45:57,370 --> 10:45:58,050
Oh, ouch, ouch.

10097
10:45:58,790 --> 10:46:00,070
Don't worry about it.

10098
10:46:00,410 --> 10:46:01,370
Don't think about it.

10099
10:46:01,770 --> 10:46:02,050
Open.

10100
10:46:09,750 --> 10:46:10,510
Big news!

10101
10:46:10,870 --> 10:46:11,630
Big news!

10102
10:46:13,410 --> 10:46:16,690
Now I can just stand here and blow this thing up.

10103
10:46:18,970 --> 10:46:21,470
Wait, is it still taking... No, okay.

10104
10:46:23,870 --> 10:46:24,270
Heal.

10105
10:46:25,610 --> 10:46:26,410
Shoot.

10106
10:46:27,310 --> 10:46:28,110
Heal.

10107
10:46:29,390 --> 10:46:30,190
Shoot.

10108
10:46:33,370 --> 10:46:36,150
I don't think he can reach me back here.

10109
10:46:37,050 --> 10:46:37,470
Ah, dummy.

10110
10:46:38,150 --> 10:46:38,450
Shoot.

10111
10:46:41,090 --> 10:46:41,890
Heal.

10112
10:46:42,870 --> 10:46:43,270
Shoot.

10113
10:46:44,490 --> 10:46:48,790
The longest ever iframes I've ever seen on a boss.

10114
10:46:49,370 --> 10:46:49,890
Ridiculous.

10115
10:47:02,950 --> 10:47:04,110
Are you gonna run out?

10116
10:47:04,170 --> 10:47:04,790
Yeah, I know.

10117
10:47:05,330 --> 10:47:06,330
Kill the other side.

10118
10:47:07,770 --> 10:47:08,810
Yeah, I should.

10119
10:47:09,250 --> 10:47:10,110
Okay, let's run.

10120
10:47:11,410 --> 10:47:12,650
Let's run to the other side.

10121
10:47:15,330 --> 10:47:15,850
Gosh.

10122
10:47:16,670 --> 10:47:17,570
Okay, now I have to...

10123
10:47:19,610 --> 10:47:20,790
There we go.

10124
10:47:20,990 --> 10:47:21,430
Right here.

10125
10:47:21,990 --> 10:47:22,430
Open up.

10126
10:47:23,570 --> 10:47:24,090
Open up, please.

10127
10:47:25,230 --> 10:47:26,570
Taste my...

10128
10:47:27,330 --> 10:47:27,690
Open.

10129
10:47:30,150 --> 10:47:30,830
Open.

10130
10:47:34,990 --> 10:47:35,670
Open.

10131
10:47:35,670 --> 10:47:36,350
Open.

10132
10:47:36,670 --> 10:47:36,690
Open.

10133
10:47:37,490 --> 10:47:38,170
Okay,

10134
10:47:43,050 --> 10:47:43,350
open.

10135
10:47:44,470 --> 10:47:47,930
Oh my gosh.

10136
10:47:54,120 --> 10:47:54,360
Open.

10137
10:47:57,060 --> 10:47:57,340
Open.

10138
10:47:59,940 --> 10:48:00,620
Yes!

10139
10:48:00,960 --> 10:48:02,120
Okay, we found the spot.

10140
10:48:02,660 --> 10:48:03,980
We found the spot.

10141
10:48:04,920 --> 10:48:05,700
Sorry.

10142
10:48:06,300 --> 10:48:07,080
Nice.

10143
10:48:08,920 --> 10:48:09,280
Open.

10144
10:48:10,960 --> 10:48:11,600
Oh no!

10145
10:48:12,300 --> 10:48:13,340
Oh no.

10146
10:48:13,880 --> 10:48:14,620
No, guys.

10147
10:48:16,300 --> 10:48:17,420
Not good.

10148
10:48:18,480 --> 10:48:19,300
Not good.

10149
10:48:19,480 --> 10:48:20,200
Oh my god, I'm trapped.

10150
10:48:20,300 --> 10:48:20,620
I'm trapped.

10151
10:48:27,010 --> 10:48:28,040
It's doing more?

10152
10:48:36,210 --> 10:48:40,610
I don't understand.

10153
10:48:41,570 --> 10:48:42,910
I tried moving!

10154
10:48:45,150 --> 10:48:46,350
Oh my god, please.

10155
10:48:47,790 --> 10:48:48,350
Open.

10156
10:48:50,870 --> 10:48:51,430
Open.

10157
10:48:53,110 --> 10:48:53,670
Open.

10158
10:48:58,510 --> 10:48:59,310
You know what?

10159
10:48:59,350 --> 10:49:00,510
I'm just gonna kill you.

10160
10:49:00,690 --> 10:49:01,290
There you go.

10161
10:49:01,610 --> 10:49:01,890
No!

10162
10:49:02,790 --> 10:49:03,530
No, I'm trapped.

10163
10:49:03,630 --> 10:49:03,930
I'm trapped.

10164
10:49:13,310 --> 10:49:14,910
Oh shit, man.

10165
10:49:14,910 --> 10:49:15,050
Man.

10166
10:49:16,710 --> 10:49:18,370
Why is it like this?

10167
10:49:20,810 --> 10:49:21,250
Open?

10168
10:49:22,530 --> 10:49:22,930
No!

10169
10:49:23,090 --> 10:49:23,630
Wrong open!

10170
10:49:27,610 --> 10:49:28,290
Wrong open.

10171
10:49:28,390 --> 10:49:28,890
Wrong open.

10172
10:49:29,610 --> 10:49:30,290
Not you.

10173
10:49:30,930 --> 10:49:31,710
Not you.

10174
10:49:32,570 --> 10:49:33,450
The other open.

10175
10:49:35,830 --> 10:49:37,530
These are killer.

10176
10:49:38,510 --> 10:49:40,010
These are... Oh my god.

10177
10:49:43,810 --> 10:49:45,850
I don't think I threw it.

10178
10:49:45,850 --> 10:49:46,910
You know what?

10179
10:49:47,250 --> 10:49:48,570
Oh, wrong.

10180
10:49:49,030 --> 10:49:49,370
You know what?

10181
10:49:49,530 --> 10:49:49,930
Screw it.

10182
10:49:50,030 --> 10:49:50,490
It's fine.

10183
10:49:53,270 --> 10:49:54,910
Life is pain after life is pain.

10184
10:49:54,990 --> 10:49:55,650
Everything is pain.

10185
10:49:56,230 --> 10:49:57,290
Where's the grenades?

10186
10:49:57,410 --> 10:49:57,930
Please spawn!

10187
10:49:58,990 --> 10:49:59,810
Oh, here they are.

10188
10:50:01,990 --> 10:50:06,810
They're like, what if we didn't spawn where you wanted them to?

10189
10:50:09,050 --> 10:50:09,550
Oh...

10190
10:50:13,250 --> 10:50:15,990
I'm gonna wait again, I think.

10191
10:50:19,790 --> 10:50:20,730
I don't know.

10192
10:50:24,130 --> 10:50:26,490
Girl, I thought I was gonna be able to watch this VOD tonight.

10193
10:50:26,670 --> 10:50:27,830
Fuck me too, man.

10194
10:50:29,510 --> 10:50:30,830
Oh, uh... Run!

10195
10:50:36,290 --> 10:50:36,790
Okay.

10196
10:50:37,630 --> 10:50:40,190
At least I can get to an area where they're not...

10197
10:50:41,470 --> 10:50:43,690
All concentrated, you know?

10198
10:50:44,390 --> 10:50:45,070
Run, run, run.

10199
10:50:47,890 --> 10:50:48,730
Ah, shit!

10200
10:50:49,490 --> 10:50:50,790
I tried running up.

10201
10:50:51,270 --> 10:50:52,290
They're so fast.

10202
10:50:53,510 --> 10:50:54,570
Oh my god, again?

10203
10:50:54,930 --> 10:50:55,990
I hate this move.

10204
10:50:56,770 --> 10:50:58,230
Please, no more.

10205
10:51:01,910 --> 10:51:02,550
Okay.

10206
10:51:05,170 --> 10:51:05,810
I

10207
10:51:09,670 --> 10:51:10,590
gotta pee.

10208
10:51:10,590 --> 10:51:10,630
Pee.

10209
10:51:12,590 --> 10:51:13,910
I've had so much water.

10210
10:51:15,050 --> 10:51:16,770
I wish I had one more ration.

10211
10:51:17,170 --> 10:51:18,390
I wish the game was kind.

10212
10:51:21,450 --> 10:51:22,690
What the hell is that?

10213
10:51:28,030 --> 10:51:30,370
I see something on the map.

10214
10:51:30,790 --> 10:51:31,730
I think it's bullets?

10215
10:51:31,870 --> 10:51:32,450
I can't tell.

10216
10:51:49,350 --> 10:51:50,110
Wait, what's happening?

10217
10:51:52,650 --> 10:51:53,590
What is this?

10218
10:51:56,390 --> 10:51:57,290
Phase... Uh oh.

10219
10:51:59,410 --> 10:52:00,350
Someone's raiding me.

10220
10:52:00,410 --> 10:52:00,810
Thank you!

10221
10:52:01,690 --> 10:52:02,530
What's going on?

10222
10:52:02,830 --> 10:52:03,390
What is this?

10223
10:52:03,750 --> 10:52:04,330
Flamethrower.

10224
10:52:17,070 --> 10:52:19,470
Maybe I can need Kida from here.

10225
10:52:21,270 --> 10:52:21,850
Nope.

10226
10:52:23,090 --> 10:52:23,710
Hold on.

10227
10:52:24,950 --> 10:52:25,990
Attack the front.

10228
10:52:35,450 --> 10:52:36,530
Oh shoot.

10229
10:52:37,050 --> 10:52:38,510
That's evil!

10230
10:52:39,490 --> 10:52:40,670
Nexy, thank you for the 10 gifted.

10231
10:52:43,870 --> 10:52:49,370
That's so evil of them to have it be like that.

10232
10:52:49,590 --> 10:52:50,490
Oh, nevermind.

10233
10:52:50,750 --> 10:52:52,250
Wow, the one time I get it in.

10234
10:52:53,950 --> 10:52:54,270
Okay.

10235
10:52:54,950 --> 10:52:55,370
Open up!

10236
10:52:55,770 --> 10:52:56,130
Open up!

10237
10:52:56,710 --> 10:52:57,290
Open up!

10238
10:52:57,630 --> 10:52:58,930
Did it eat it?

10239
10:53:00,050 --> 10:53:00,610
Is

10240
10:53:13,020 --> 10:53:13,620
it doing damage?

10241
10:53:17,780 --> 10:53:19,240
No, I didn't think so.

10242
10:53:19,240 --> 10:53:20,260
Did it do damage?

10243
10:53:22,100 --> 10:53:23,160
It wasn't open?

10244
10:53:23,600 --> 10:53:24,640
I think it was.

10245
10:53:24,780 --> 10:53:26,540
I don't think it's... Let's see.

10246
10:53:27,740 --> 10:53:28,560
That's my fault.

10247
10:53:34,920 --> 10:53:36,180
Oh, come on!

10248
10:53:52,850 --> 10:53:54,470
I don't wanna get in front of it.

10249
10:53:55,930 --> 10:53:57,450
No, I didn't hit it there.

10250
10:53:58,030 --> 10:53:59,210
You might have to grenade it.

10251
10:53:59,370 --> 10:54:00,150
Oh shoot.

10252
10:54:02,390 --> 10:54:03,950
At least you're still laughing.

10253
10:54:04,050 --> 10:54:05,150
I'd be throwing...

10254
10:54:06,130 --> 10:54:08,090
Amanda, many tears have been shed.

10255
10:54:08,130 --> 10:54:08,610
Don't worry.

10256
10:54:09,230 --> 10:54:10,090
Oh my gosh.

10257
10:54:10,530 --> 10:54:11,470
I'm not strong.

10258
10:54:11,670 --> 10:54:13,730
I'm not strong enough for this.

10259
10:54:14,430 --> 10:54:15,330
This is nonsense!

10260
10:54:19,550 --> 10:54:20,510
Face him!

10261
10:54:20,870 --> 10:54:22,390
I'm gonna die for real!

10262
10:54:24,890 --> 10:54:25,710
I'll do it.

10263
10:54:25,750 --> 10:54:27,990
I'll keep going until my Nikita missiles run out, okay?

10264
10:54:27,990 --> 10:54:30,930
Let's keep trying until...

10265
10:54:30,930 --> 10:54:32,510
Nikita runs out.

10266
10:54:35,950 --> 10:54:41,460
I think his fire explodes it.

10267
10:54:41,500 --> 10:54:42,260
I'm not gonna lie.

10268
10:54:44,900 --> 10:54:47,220
I think his... I think his...

10269
10:54:47,220 --> 10:54:50,420
I think his fire explodes it.

10270
10:54:53,820 --> 10:54:54,580
Guys...

10271
10:54:56,240 --> 10:54:58,540
It's been nice knowing you all.

10272
10:55:03,060 --> 10:55:05,320
It's been nice knowing you all.

10273
10:55:12,560 --> 10:55:13,360
Throw!

10274
10:55:14,600 --> 10:55:15,600
Eat it!

10275
10:55:15,900 --> 10:55:16,280
Eat up!

10276
10:55:16,520 --> 10:55:16,860
Eat up!

10277
10:55:37,930 --> 10:55:39,590
There's none over here.

10278
10:55:48,600 --> 10:55:50,320
Where are the grenades?

10279
10:55:50,480 --> 10:55:51,140
Grenades!

10280
10:55:51,220 --> 10:55:52,100
Grenades, please!

10281
10:55:52,500 --> 10:55:53,200
Grenades!

10282
10:55:54,220 --> 10:55:55,240
Over here.

10283
10:56:00,800 --> 10:56:01,600
Yummy!

10284
10:56:02,400 --> 10:56:03,200
Yummy!

10285
10:56:04,540 --> 10:56:05,100
No!

10286
10:56:05,500 --> 10:56:05,840
No!

10287
10:56:11,270 --> 10:56:12,630
Oh god!

10288
10:56:23,830 --> 10:56:26,810
I was so close!

10289
10:56:29,850 --> 10:56:31,210
It's sickening.

10290
10:56:32,830 --> 10:56:34,270
Sickening, sickening.

10291
10:56:38,520 --> 10:56:39,700
Oh my god.

10292
10:56:40,540 --> 10:56:42,120
Thanks for the raid, whoever's raiding me!

10293
10:56:56,370 --> 10:56:59,310
If you're coming in and you don't know who I am...

10294
10:56:59,310 --> 10:57:00,890
Click off the stream, please.

10295
10:57:02,990 --> 10:57:04,750
I don't want you to see me like this.

10296
10:57:05,210 --> 10:57:05,650
Please!

10297
10:57:06,470 --> 10:57:07,950
I don't want you to see me like this.

10298
10:57:14,370 --> 10:57:15,310
It's an embarrassment.

10299
10:57:20,860 --> 10:57:24,140
You can just go, I understand it now and it's over for this.

10300
10:57:24,640 --> 10:57:25,420
Wait, what do you mean?

10301
10:57:26,120 --> 10:57:26,800
I don't get it.

10302
10:57:29,300 --> 10:57:30,500
They're about to see you win.

10303
10:57:30,580 --> 10:57:31,400
Don't jinx it!

10304
10:57:31,860 --> 10:57:33,000
Red, don't jinx it!

10305
10:57:35,000 --> 10:57:36,060
Don't jinx it!

10306
10:57:37,760 --> 10:57:42,960
Alright, let's not waste any grenades on myself.

10307
10:57:44,520 --> 10:57:49,680
And maybe we'll have a good amount for when he starts throwing up.

10308
10:57:58,030 --> 10:58:01,370
Bucket capacity, I'm about to...

10309
10:58:01,370 --> 10:58:06,790
I'm about to ban you forever.

10310
10:58:07,970 --> 10:58:08,990
Don't be mean!

10311
10:58:09,330 --> 10:58:11,430
This is not the time to be mean, please.

10312
10:58:12,930 --> 10:58:13,730
I'm serious.

10313
10:58:18,270 --> 10:58:20,090
I need my little vest on.

10314
10:58:20,870 --> 10:58:21,710
Alright, run, run, run.

10315
10:58:24,110 --> 10:58:26,010
I don't know what that...

10316
10:58:27,030 --> 10:58:28,810
I don't know what that super chat just said.

10317
10:58:28,850 --> 10:58:29,970
I only saw a doki bird.

10318
10:58:30,850 --> 10:58:31,650
I'm confused.

10319
10:58:32,430 --> 10:58:33,010
Is that a bait?

10320
10:58:33,190 --> 10:58:33,370
No.

10321
10:58:48,530 --> 10:58:49,310
That's close enough.

10322
10:58:57,950 --> 10:59:03,310
Like, I saw some comments from people being like, Minto, you always get this way during final bosses.

10323
10:59:04,050 --> 10:59:08,950
But it's mostly I get this way, I feel, when I've been streaming for a long, long time.

10324
10:59:09,470 --> 10:59:10,750
And I get a little grumpy.

10325
10:59:11,590 --> 10:59:18,190
So I apologize for getting grumpy and frustrated.

10326
10:59:21,170 --> 10:59:22,210
But sometimes...

10327
10:59:24,310 --> 10:59:26,510
Some things are not fair.

10328
10:59:27,350 --> 10:59:30,910
And I think I have a right to be grumpy about the unfairness of certain fights.

10329
10:59:35,890 --> 10:59:37,710
Gamer rage is natural.

10330
10:59:38,110 --> 10:59:38,550
Exactly.

10331
10:59:39,590 --> 10:59:41,050
My skills as a gamer.

10332
10:59:41,870 --> 10:59:42,110
Nice.

10333
10:59:45,230 --> 10:59:46,370
So I apologize.

10334
10:59:50,820 --> 10:59:52,380
And I cry out of frustration.

10335
10:59:53,560 --> 10:59:56,980
It's not like I'm like, I'm so sad.

10336
10:59:57,240 --> 10:59:58,640
It's just when I get really frustrated.

10337
10:59:58,740 --> 11:00:02,820
Which is so annoying because I'm one of those, like, if I get angry I cry type of people.

10338
11:00:03,040 --> 11:00:07,060
So it's just like I can't be taken seriously because I'm crying when I'm angry.

10339
11:00:07,320 --> 11:00:10,180
But it's not like I'm like suffering, you know.

10340
11:00:10,240 --> 11:00:11,520
I'm just like...

10341
11:00:11,520 --> 11:00:13,340
It's a ghost thing, you know.

10342
11:00:14,340 --> 11:00:16,540
I'm a ghost and I'm always, you know...

10343
11:00:17,380 --> 11:00:21,180
I'm always angry and I cry, I moan, you know, stuff like that.

10344
11:00:21,180 --> 11:00:21,480
Oh.

10345
11:00:23,060 --> 11:00:24,800
Colonel didn't even talk to me.

10346
11:00:25,140 --> 11:00:28,060
In about 20 minutes he'll break the record of longest solo stream.

10347
11:00:29,740 --> 11:00:30,140
Mine?

10348
11:00:34,290 --> 11:00:35,210
That's so funny.

10349
11:00:37,810 --> 11:00:38,330
Okay.

10350
11:00:40,410 --> 11:00:42,210
Guys, I think I have to go to the bathroom now.

10351
11:00:42,490 --> 11:00:43,170
I gotta go!

10352
11:00:45,290 --> 11:00:47,710
You can listen to this sick sweet song.

10353
11:00:48,950 --> 11:00:52,510
At least the song is way better than the previous levels.

10354
11:00:55,610 --> 11:00:56,310
I've

10355
11:03:14,190 --> 11:03:15,490
been answering...

10356
11:03:15,490 --> 11:03:17,370
I've been answering...

10357
11:03:18,910 --> 11:03:20,290
Discord messages.

10358
11:03:36,880 --> 11:03:42,120
Metal Gear or the MGS con people are messaging me.

10359
11:03:42,220 --> 11:03:43,160
They're just like, good luck!

10360
11:03:48,450 --> 11:03:50,330
You got this, good luck!

10361
11:03:50,550 --> 11:03:50,830
Thanks!

10362
11:03:51,610 --> 11:03:53,330
Vulcan versus Solidus.

10363
11:03:53,370 --> 11:03:55,010
Who wins in the twerk off?

10364
11:03:57,190 --> 11:03:57,810
Vulcan.

10365
11:03:58,590 --> 11:04:00,430
He has experience.

10366
11:04:01,290 --> 11:04:02,270
Okay, grenades!

10367
11:04:03,670 --> 11:04:04,750
Alright, let's get back in.

10368
11:04:05,610 --> 11:04:07,610
Right in here?

10369
11:04:09,110 --> 11:04:10,250
Does this seem correct?

10370
11:04:10,390 --> 11:04:11,390
Maybe a little closer.

10371
11:04:13,390 --> 11:04:14,010
Open!

10372
11:04:15,110 --> 11:04:16,370
Oh, not there.

10373
11:04:16,650 --> 11:04:17,150
Not there.

10374
11:04:21,380 --> 11:04:22,360
Once about two...

10375
11:04:24,080 --> 11:04:24,600
Open?

10376
11:04:27,360 --> 11:04:28,200
Why not?

10377
11:04:29,500 --> 11:04:30,480
Oh, there we go.

10378
11:04:30,580 --> 11:04:30,860
I think.

10379
11:04:31,880 --> 11:04:32,140
Maybe.

10380
11:04:36,900 --> 11:04:38,620
Maybe I need to get closer.

10381
11:04:41,320 --> 11:04:42,640
Chill, chill, chill.

10382
11:04:43,840 --> 11:04:44,740
Chill, top.

10383
11:04:44,860 --> 11:04:45,600
Chill, chill!

10384
11:04:46,940 --> 11:04:48,460
What happened to when you guys were dumb?

10385
11:04:48,460 --> 11:04:49,380
A little closer.

10386
11:04:50,100 --> 11:04:51,080
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

10387
11:04:51,460 --> 11:04:52,200
Open, please.

10388
11:04:53,740 --> 11:04:54,800
Okay, we got it.

10389
11:04:54,960 --> 11:04:55,300
Nice.

10390
11:04:56,940 --> 11:04:58,320
Is the VOD gonna survive?

10391
11:04:58,400 --> 11:04:58,760
Hopefully.

10392
11:05:03,140 --> 11:05:03,620
Please!

10393
11:05:04,060 --> 11:05:04,740
Stop it!

10394
11:05:05,240 --> 11:05:06,060
Leave me alone!

10395
11:05:06,980 --> 11:05:07,580
Oh my god.

10396
11:05:07,840 --> 11:05:09,560
I'm gonna become the Joker.

10397
11:05:11,420 --> 11:05:12,680
I'm gonna become the Joker.

10398
11:05:19,950 --> 11:05:20,590
No!

10399
11:05:21,210 --> 11:05:22,530
Ah, shit!

10400
11:05:22,990 --> 11:05:26,190
Guys, I took too long of a break.

10401
11:05:26,850 --> 11:05:27,150
I think.

10402
11:05:27,610 --> 11:05:31,010
Oh my god.

10403
11:05:32,030 --> 11:05:32,670
Okay.

10404
11:05:33,730 --> 11:05:34,090
Open?

10405
11:05:35,710 --> 11:05:36,770
No, top!

10406
11:05:36,890 --> 11:05:37,630
Leave me alone!

10407
11:05:41,650 --> 11:05:42,810
Okay, they're a little stupid.

10408
11:05:43,230 --> 11:05:44,170
We appreciate that.

10409
11:05:48,480 --> 11:05:49,160
Okay, open!

10410
11:05:50,920 --> 11:05:51,560
Please.

10411
11:05:51,920 --> 11:05:52,680
Where are you?

10412
11:05:53,300 --> 11:05:54,200
Why is it?

10413
11:05:54,280 --> 11:05:55,060
Why is it?

10414
11:05:55,560 --> 11:05:57,860
Why is it not being so good now?

10415
11:05:58,020 --> 11:05:58,960
I don't understand.

10416
11:06:00,000 --> 11:06:01,440
I don't get it!

10417
11:06:02,240 --> 11:06:04,300
Why is my RNG so bad?

10418
11:06:07,300 --> 11:06:09,440
Is it... like this, maybe?

10419
11:06:16,030 --> 11:06:16,510
What?!

10420
11:06:17,770 --> 11:06:18,730
Nade the gun?

10421
11:06:18,850 --> 11:06:21,170
Yeah, but I don't have enough time to get into position.

10422
11:06:22,270 --> 11:06:22,910
Oh, it's done!

10423
11:06:22,970 --> 11:06:23,370
It's done!

10424
11:06:23,590 --> 11:06:24,090
Holy shit.

10425
11:06:25,290 --> 11:06:26,010
Let's go?

10426
11:06:26,130 --> 11:06:26,390
Okay.

10427
11:06:29,390 --> 11:06:31,070
I wasted so many grenades.

10428
11:06:32,550 --> 11:06:34,470
And I'm about to waste a ration.

10429
11:06:39,300 --> 11:06:41,400
Oh, you bitch.

10430
11:06:42,980 --> 11:06:44,620
Oh, where did my nades go?

10431
11:06:46,240 --> 11:06:46,800
There we go.

10432
11:06:50,200 --> 11:06:50,680
Ouch.

10433
11:06:53,760 --> 11:06:54,680
Oh my god.

10434
11:06:54,760 --> 11:06:55,140
You know what?

10435
11:06:55,220 --> 11:06:55,740
Screw you!

10436
11:06:56,320 --> 11:06:57,260
And screw you!

10437
11:06:57,800 --> 11:06:58,480
Screw you!

10438
11:06:58,760 --> 11:06:59,180
Oh, okay.

10439
11:06:59,300 --> 11:06:59,720
Never mind.

10440
11:07:00,520 --> 11:07:02,720
This angle is really tricky for me.

10441
11:07:02,880 --> 11:07:03,500
I don't know why.

10442
11:07:04,320 --> 11:07:05,920
The one here is really hard for me.

10443
11:07:06,060 --> 11:07:06,240
Okay.

10444
11:07:06,740 --> 11:07:08,700
So, about right in front of this rock.

10445
11:07:11,500 --> 11:07:12,180
Stop it!

10446
11:07:13,340 --> 11:07:14,220
Oh, okay.

10447
11:07:14,400 --> 11:07:14,820
You know what?

10448
11:07:14,860 --> 11:07:15,680
That works, I guess.

10449
11:07:16,220 --> 11:07:18,340
I can't get the angle on this one!

10450
11:07:18,820 --> 11:07:20,000
Guys, I'm restarting.

10451
11:07:20,020 --> 11:07:20,400
I'm sorry.

10452
11:07:21,020 --> 11:07:21,760
I'm sorry.

10453
11:07:21,940 --> 11:07:22,880
It's really bad.

10454
11:07:24,300 --> 11:07:25,520
This isn't good.

10455
11:07:25,720 --> 11:07:26,420
This is bad.

10456
11:07:33,560 --> 11:07:35,840
I've taken too much useless damage.

10457
11:07:37,640 --> 11:07:38,840
I'll still try.

10458
11:07:38,960 --> 11:07:39,820
Don't get me wrong.

10459
11:07:40,100 --> 11:07:43,980
It's just, if I get hit by even like two missiles, I'm donezo.

10460
11:07:46,380 --> 11:07:47,100
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

10461
11:07:48,980 --> 11:07:49,440
Eat!

10462
11:08:15,900 --> 11:08:16,820
Redo.

10463
11:08:17,720 --> 11:08:18,640
Redo.

10464
11:08:21,400 --> 11:08:22,460
Just kill me!

10465
11:08:23,020 --> 11:08:23,780
Kill me!

10466
11:08:24,320 --> 11:08:25,180
Kill me!

10467
11:08:25,800 --> 11:08:27,100
Kill me!

10468
11:08:27,240 --> 11:08:27,680
No!

10469
11:08:28,360 --> 11:08:29,340
Thank you.

10470
11:08:31,440 --> 11:08:32,720
I craved death.

10471
11:08:34,480 --> 11:08:34,920
Okay.

10472
11:08:35,200 --> 11:08:35,620
Alright.

10473
11:08:45,370 --> 11:08:46,550
Really, thank you!

10474
11:08:46,550 --> 11:08:48,250
Feeling really eepy.

10475
11:08:48,530 --> 11:08:49,560
I'm gonna give you an early congratulation.

10476
11:08:51,730 --> 11:08:52,710
Thank you.

10477
11:09:04,070 --> 11:09:06,630
Grenading the machine gun seems to activate the turret.

10478
11:09:06,810 --> 11:09:07,330
I know.

10479
11:09:07,770 --> 11:09:08,870
I do know that.

10480
11:09:09,550 --> 11:09:17,470
I just can't... Since it's such an awkward position to grenade the turret, it's easier for me to wait it out.

10481
11:09:19,250 --> 11:09:19,650
Because...

10482
11:09:20,150 --> 11:09:25,330
Otherwise, I grenade it and then I just immediately... I basically immediately get hit by the turret.

10483
11:09:30,610 --> 11:09:34,470
Like, it's harder for me to grenade the gun and then hope that I get the turret.

10484
11:09:38,480 --> 11:09:40,060
Easier to stick to the right side.

10485
11:09:40,500 --> 11:09:44,720
Well, once I blow up the one thing, I should get both of them, should I not?

10486
11:09:45,000 --> 11:09:45,280
You know?

10487
11:09:47,580 --> 11:09:50,380
Because it's such a specific position.

10488
11:09:51,180 --> 11:09:55,280
And on the left side, it's so awkward because that one rock...

10489
11:09:55,920 --> 11:09:56,840
It's so tricky.

10490
11:10:06,880 --> 11:10:09,040
They deactivate once you get to the mouth phase?

10491
11:10:09,120 --> 11:10:09,280
Okay.

10492
11:10:11,900 --> 11:10:12,920
Shut up, Cardo!

10493
11:10:18,520 --> 11:10:19,480
Not that.

10494
11:10:19,700 --> 11:10:20,160
Not yet.

10495
11:10:21,140 --> 11:10:22,340
I'm getting ahead of myself.

10496
11:10:25,040 --> 11:10:27,480
Wow, the first step is a bait.

10497
11:10:27,660 --> 11:10:28,440
That's insane.

10498
11:10:48,830 --> 11:10:51,950
Guys, honestly, I don't even care so much if I lose the VOD of this.

10499
11:10:58,590 --> 11:11:01,610
I don't wanna make a new stream just for it.

10500
11:11:11,090 --> 11:11:13,450
My throat hurts so bad.

10501
11:11:16,620 --> 11:11:22,680
Hopefully I'll be able to beat it in time, but...

10502
11:11:24,720 --> 11:11:28,840
Honestly, if I go over a little, we'll see what happens.

10503
11:11:31,520 --> 11:11:34,180
I don't want to put pressure on me, though.

10504
11:11:34,180 --> 11:11:38,320
I don't want to put pressure on me to be like...

10505
11:11:38,320 --> 11:11:40,700
Okay, I have 30 minutes left.

10506
11:11:40,780 --> 11:11:41,920
I need to do it now.

10507
11:11:42,440 --> 11:11:44,040
That's just gonna stress me out more.

10508
11:11:55,450 --> 11:11:57,950
I just arrived, so I'm hoping it gets saved.

10509
11:12:00,950 --> 11:12:01,430
Go,

10510
11:12:08,100 --> 11:12:08,580
go, go.

10511
11:12:08,860 --> 11:12:10,000
General, you suck.

10512
11:12:10,800 --> 11:12:11,800
This guy sucks.

10513
11:12:14,900 --> 11:12:15,680
Okay.

10514
11:12:19,040 --> 11:12:20,210
Alrighty, and...

10515
11:12:20,600 --> 11:12:21,520
Ben Stiller.

10516
11:12:22,840 --> 11:12:25,000
Yeah, go Ben Stiller!

10517
11:12:25,720 --> 11:12:27,920
Go Ben Stiller!

10518
11:12:29,760 --> 11:12:32,660
Viewers are encouraging Minty Fresh Kyle.

10519
11:12:32,920 --> 11:12:33,300
What?

10520
11:12:33,820 --> 11:12:35,100
Kyle's stealing my thunder.

10521
11:12:40,480 --> 11:12:41,780
Okay, you know what?

10522
11:12:41,820 --> 11:12:42,060
Fine.

10523
11:12:42,220 --> 11:12:43,520
Fine, fine, fine.

10524
11:12:43,520 --> 11:12:45,060
I can't do this perfectly.

10525
11:12:45,380 --> 11:12:45,740
Fine.

10526
11:12:45,980 --> 11:12:46,400
You know what?

10527
11:12:46,460 --> 11:12:46,760
Whatever.

10528
11:12:47,200 --> 11:12:49,260
Sometimes... Wow, what is this?

10529
11:12:49,840 --> 11:12:50,140
What?

10530
11:12:54,080 --> 11:12:55,280
Fine, fine.

10531
11:12:59,070 --> 11:13:02,390
Sometimes you're gonna come down faster than you do normally.

10532
11:13:02,610 --> 11:13:04,950
I can't stop unseeing the monkey, honestly.

10533
11:13:06,890 --> 11:13:08,010
Oh, I missed.

10534
11:13:08,370 --> 11:13:11,410
I can't stop seeing a monkey when Snake is running forward.

10535
11:13:11,750 --> 11:13:12,790
I'm sorry, everybody.

10536
11:13:12,790 --> 11:13:15,670
I just see a monkey with his ears.

10537
11:13:23,900 --> 11:13:24,680
I hear vibing.

10538
11:13:25,040 --> 11:13:26,920
Don't bring me to your words, you wuss.

10539
11:13:28,340 --> 11:13:29,740
Oh, I should've gotten that one.

10540
11:13:30,100 --> 11:13:30,400
Shoot.

10541
11:13:38,120 --> 11:13:43,140
I just went a perfect run because I take so much damage in the second part.

10542
11:13:45,340 --> 11:13:47,960
Why is that so much to ask for?

10543
11:13:48,640 --> 11:13:49,660
Ape escape?

10544
11:13:52,180 --> 11:13:53,780
Oh, I don't know if that'll... No.

10545
11:14:02,620 --> 11:14:03,500
One more.

10546
11:14:05,740 --> 11:14:08,380
And I waste... Oh wait, these are landmines, not grenades.

10547
11:14:08,600 --> 11:14:08,820
Nice.

10548
11:14:09,060 --> 11:14:09,500
No!

10549
11:14:10,280 --> 11:14:11,380
You bastard!

10550
11:14:16,790 --> 11:14:18,650
The left one seems to come down faster.

10551
11:14:18,730 --> 11:14:20,970
It does, and that's why I don't always go for it.

10552
11:14:20,970 --> 11:14:22,830
It actually... It does.

10553
11:14:23,130 --> 11:14:26,050
I don't think the right one ever comes down faster like that.

10554
11:14:27,150 --> 11:14:28,070
Just the left one.

10555
11:14:30,450 --> 11:14:36,730
Which is why I have... If you see me sometimes skipping the left side, that's why.

10556
11:14:38,270 --> 11:14:40,190
Okay, okay, okay.

10557
11:14:43,310 --> 11:14:44,270
Alright, here we go.

10558
11:14:46,130 --> 11:14:47,310
But the right one does juke you.

10559
11:14:47,390 --> 11:14:49,450
I don't know if the left one does too or not.

10560
11:14:49,450 --> 11:14:50,230
Emperor!

10561
11:14:50,470 --> 11:14:51,010
Welcome to my membership.

10562
11:14:51,090 --> 11:14:51,570
Thank you!

10563
11:14:53,370 --> 11:14:55,270
This is not the last thing in the game?

10564
11:14:56,670 --> 11:14:58,070
Wait, what do you mean by that?

10565
11:14:58,490 --> 11:15:00,010
Is there an escape sequence too?

10566
11:15:00,950 --> 11:15:04,070
Because if there is, I'm mostly fine with that.

10567
11:15:05,910 --> 11:15:07,450
Oh, let's see if we're...

10568
11:15:10,450 --> 11:15:11,270
There's more?

10569
11:15:12,190 --> 11:15:13,890
Wait, no, there's not another boss.

10570
11:15:16,470 --> 11:15:17,410
No, there's not.

10571
11:15:31,570 --> 11:15:32,490
Oh my god, you're right.

10572
11:15:35,510 --> 11:15:37,030
Oh my god, you're right.

10573
11:16:01,660 --> 11:16:02,300
Ouch!

10574
11:16:02,300 --> 11:16:03,960
Immediate hit, bro!

10575
11:16:05,940 --> 11:16:06,580
Open!

10576
11:16:08,320 --> 11:16:10,400
Oh, how is it hitting me?

10577
11:16:10,720 --> 11:16:12,720
It's facing the other side!

10578
11:16:13,260 --> 11:16:14,480
How is it hitting me?

10579
11:16:15,840 --> 11:16:17,000
What the fuck?

10580
11:16:17,000 --> 11:16:17,160
Okay.

10581
11:16:21,050 --> 11:16:22,290
What time is it anyway?

10582
11:16:22,470 --> 11:16:22,710
Okay.

10583
11:16:24,050 --> 11:16:25,110
Oh, I did it though.

10584
11:16:26,950 --> 11:16:27,230
Oh.

10585
11:16:30,570 --> 11:16:31,670
Guys, this is not it.

10586
11:16:31,930 --> 11:16:32,610
This is not it.

10587
11:16:32,710 --> 11:16:33,710
Am I getting hit here too?

10588
11:16:40,660 --> 11:16:41,880
The other gun?

10589
11:16:42,520 --> 11:16:43,720
That's ridiculous.

10590
11:16:49,040 --> 11:16:50,200
How does it reach?

10591
11:16:50,800 --> 11:16:51,580
Okay, I'm not.

10592
11:16:51,740 --> 11:16:52,160
Okay, good.

10593
11:16:52,160 --> 11:16:53,060
Ah.

10594
11:17:00,190 --> 11:17:01,410
No, I can't.

10595
11:17:09,030 --> 11:17:11,370
Okay, thank god it's not opening up.

10596
11:17:19,500 --> 11:17:20,680
Oh my god.

10597
11:17:20,700 --> 11:17:21,300
Oh, the tops.

10598
11:17:21,660 --> 11:17:24,020
I took it out before the tops even arrived.

10599
11:17:24,340 --> 11:17:25,300
That's crazy.

10600
11:17:34,010 --> 11:17:34,610
Okay.

10601
11:17:36,950 --> 11:17:38,710
I'm just gonna work on this.

10602
11:17:39,490 --> 11:17:43,110
I'm just gonna sit here and do this instead.

10603
11:17:45,150 --> 11:17:46,710
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

10604
11:17:56,680 --> 11:17:57,860
It turned around.

10605
11:17:57,920 --> 11:18:00,020
It was like, I don't want to shoot at you anymore.

10606
11:18:01,700 --> 11:18:02,720
Did you see that?

10607
11:18:02,980 --> 11:18:07,140
It was shooting over here and then it was like, fine if you're gonna be like that.

10608
11:18:08,220 --> 11:18:10,680
Alright, little chips, little chips, little chips.

10609
11:18:11,260 --> 11:18:13,940
Soon is going to be missile time, baby.

10610
11:18:15,300 --> 11:18:17,280
And about now, I think.

10611
11:18:19,240 --> 11:18:20,200
Next shot.

10612
11:18:21,940 --> 11:18:22,760
Next shot?

10613
11:18:23,640 --> 11:18:24,900
Wait, is it not... Oh.

10614
11:18:26,240 --> 11:18:27,960
Is it not taking damage anymore?

10615
11:18:28,420 --> 11:18:28,960
One more.

10616
11:18:29,520 --> 11:18:30,140
Okay, it is.

10617
11:18:30,180 --> 11:18:30,720
Just kidding.

10618
11:18:35,390 --> 11:18:37,050
Why is it not taking damage?

10619
11:18:41,130 --> 11:18:42,010
Okay, there we go.

10620
11:18:43,650 --> 11:18:45,590
It's two grenades if you don't move sides.

10621
11:18:46,110 --> 11:18:47,230
I see, I see.

10622
11:18:48,870 --> 11:18:49,970
That's how they get you.

10623
11:19:14,900 --> 11:19:15,600
Open up.

10624
11:19:18,060 --> 11:19:21,580
Sorry guys, I know I'm taking this really slow, but...

10625
11:19:23,980 --> 11:19:25,340
I'm just nervous.

10626
11:19:33,990 --> 11:19:35,090
Slow and steady.

10627
11:19:43,740 --> 11:19:44,380
Hello?

10628
11:19:45,400 --> 11:19:46,040
Hello?

10629
11:19:48,020 --> 11:19:48,580
Hello?

10630
11:19:49,660 --> 11:19:50,000
Hello?

10631
11:19:52,400 --> 11:19:55,920
Don't say it might end up being a 24 hour stream, it's so rude.

10632
11:19:55,920 --> 11:19:58,820
You mean 12 hour?

10633
11:19:59,040 --> 11:20:00,080
I mean, yes.

10634
11:20:03,060 --> 11:20:05,680
24 hours on one boss.

10635
11:20:08,880 --> 11:20:09,900
Move up slightly.

10636
11:20:16,370 --> 11:20:16,690
Hello?

10637
11:20:18,130 --> 11:20:19,030
Hello?

10638
11:20:31,390 --> 11:20:32,350
Whatever.

10639
11:20:36,570 --> 11:20:37,450
Oh, shoot.

10640
11:20:39,310 --> 11:20:40,730
Was I too late?

10641
11:20:40,950 --> 11:20:41,110
No?

10642
11:20:51,930 --> 11:20:54,070
Oh yeah, you're making up for lost time now, huh?

10643
11:20:58,310 --> 11:20:59,090
Oh god.

10644
11:21:00,670 --> 11:21:01,190
Shit.

10645
11:21:01,550 --> 11:21:02,230
Don't shoot me.

10646
11:21:11,050 --> 11:21:11,570
God.

10647
11:21:11,570 --> 11:21:12,090
God.

10648
11:21:13,770 --> 11:21:18,230
I don't know how I have any reflexes left after all this time.

10649
11:21:18,730 --> 11:21:20,010
I don't know how.

10650
11:21:21,370 --> 11:21:22,210
Ah,

10651
11:21:39,640 --> 11:21:40,020
shit.

10652
11:21:41,060 --> 11:21:42,320
I tried to overcorrect.

10653
11:21:54,220 --> 11:21:55,900
Big damage.

10654
11:22:05,230 --> 11:22:06,750
We're at the fire!

10655
11:22:08,150 --> 11:22:09,310
Oh my god!

10656
11:22:11,760 --> 11:22:13,580
We made it to the fire!

10657
11:22:15,020 --> 11:22:15,860
Holy shit!

10658
11:22:16,460 --> 11:22:19,200
Oh my

10659
11:22:27,770 --> 11:22:28,150
gosh.

10660
11:22:51,390 --> 11:22:51,970
Terrible!

10661
11:22:51,970 --> 11:22:52,870
Yeah!

10662
11:23:06,270 --> 11:23:08,370
I might need to get some more water, you guys.

10663
11:23:09,270 --> 11:23:10,470
Solid Snake.

10664
11:23:11,610 --> 11:23:17,170
The name legend may have been propaganda, but it seems no exaggeration.

10665
11:23:17,330 --> 11:23:18,810
Sorry, I pressed B instead.

10666
11:23:19,230 --> 11:23:21,510
Also, if I...

10667
11:23:21,510 --> 11:23:29,890
Okay, does anybody know if I lose to him if I have to start over the Metal Gear fight again?

10668
11:23:30,210 --> 11:23:31,710
Do I have to do all of it again?

10669
11:23:35,090 --> 11:23:35,830
We're frozen?

10670
11:23:36,070 --> 11:23:38,230
Oh gosh, the chat is just stinky.

10671
11:23:39,910 --> 11:23:41,030
No, it's another stage.

10672
11:23:42,010 --> 11:23:43,050
Yeah, baby!

10673
11:23:44,250 --> 11:23:46,170
Thank you guys for the superchats!

10674
11:23:46,230 --> 11:23:47,010
Thank you!

10675
11:23:48,830 --> 11:23:50,070
Okay, it's a new mission.

10676
11:23:50,190 --> 11:23:50,910
Oh yeah, you're right.

10677
11:23:50,950 --> 11:23:51,590
It is a new mission.

10678
11:23:51,730 --> 11:23:52,730
Because we got the stage clear.

10679
11:23:54,730 --> 11:23:56,190
Ducky, thanks for the 10 guilted!

10680
11:23:57,770 --> 11:23:58,910
I want the truth.

10681
11:23:59,230 --> 11:23:59,950
All of it.

10682
11:24:02,750 --> 11:24:04,870
Why is he looking at me like that?

10683
11:24:05,570 --> 11:24:06,770
Easiest boss ever.

10684
11:24:08,010 --> 11:24:11,010
Why did that last round go so well?

10685
11:24:13,230 --> 11:24:17,170
That last round went insanely well.

10686
11:24:17,870 --> 11:24:19,230
A winner's privilege.

10687
11:24:19,870 --> 11:24:20,950
After all...

10688
11:24:21,470 --> 11:24:23,050
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

10689
11:24:23,210 --> 11:24:27,430
I'm gonna try and be less chatty, so hopefully we can save this VOD, right?

10690
11:24:27,430 --> 11:24:39,050
After all, you have the right to know about Outer Heaven, Metal Gear, Project Babel, and the link between GILF and the US.

10691
11:24:39,950 --> 11:24:41,470
Your dodges were on point.

10692
11:24:41,590 --> 11:24:42,210
Thank you!

10693
11:24:43,790 --> 11:24:49,670
Outer Heaven was a US-backed venture that provided mercenaries to its clients.

10694
11:24:50,590 --> 11:24:55,330
It was a way to unofficially check anti-American forces.

10695
11:24:56,790 --> 11:25:02,490
And the idea apparently originated with the DDCI of the time.

10696
11:25:02,610 --> 11:25:03,770
What's DDCI?

10697
11:25:05,210 --> 11:25:05,390
What?

10698
11:25:07,150 --> 11:25:09,270
But the field commander?

10699
11:25:10,270 --> 11:25:11,050
Big Boss?

10700
11:25:11,710 --> 11:25:15,690
Was a loose cannon that broke out of the program.

10701
11:25:17,250 --> 11:25:20,370
And Outer Heaven was brought down by you.

10702
11:25:20,450 --> 11:25:23,330
It's actually kind of funny that it's like hired mercenaries.

10703
11:25:24,630 --> 11:25:26,450
Outer... well, like...

10704
11:25:27,370 --> 11:25:28,250
What's it called?

10705
11:25:28,890 --> 11:25:31,330
Oh my gosh, my brain is fried right now.

10706
11:25:34,350 --> 11:25:36,950
Mother Base was kind of like that, right?

10707
11:25:37,130 --> 11:25:37,670
What's it called?

10708
11:25:39,870 --> 11:25:41,150
Yeah, MSF.

10709
11:25:42,710 --> 11:25:51,850
As a part of the plausible denial of their involvement in Outer Heaven, the government constructed a hero myth.

10710
11:25:53,330 --> 11:25:57,590
Handed you and Foxhound to the international media.

10711
11:25:58,010 --> 11:25:58,590
PMC!

10712
11:25:58,750 --> 11:25:59,410
Yes, thank you.

10713
11:26:00,770 --> 11:26:02,670
I was combining GMO.

10714
11:26:03,510 --> 11:26:04,930
So I was like, PMO?

10715
11:26:05,430 --> 11:26:05,810
No.

10716
11:26:07,670 --> 11:26:12,230
That is the truth behind your rise to the status of a legend.

10717
11:26:13,550 --> 11:26:16,450
Now imagine doing all that boss in a small GBC screen.

10718
11:26:19,730 --> 11:26:20,990
Chemical Burgers.

10719
11:26:22,330 --> 11:26:22,810
McBurger.

10720
11:26:23,890 --> 11:26:24,910
Shocking, isn't it?

10721
11:26:25,570 --> 11:26:29,810
To learn that your glory was a staged one.

10722
11:26:31,690 --> 11:26:33,050
Put on a good show, man.

10723
11:26:33,630 --> 11:26:35,710
And the connection between GILF...

10724
11:26:35,710 --> 11:26:37,870
Okay, I hate when they say stuff like that though.

10725
11:26:37,950 --> 11:26:40,790
Because Snake still had to do the effort, right?

10726
11:26:42,270 --> 11:26:43,730
Unless they were just like...

10727
11:26:43,730 --> 11:26:45,370
Yeah, you know that super hard fight?

10728
11:26:47,270 --> 11:26:48,230
It was staged.

10729
11:26:49,210 --> 11:26:50,970
Connection between GILF and the U.S.

10730
11:26:52,730 --> 11:26:55,150
Even after Outer Heaven collapsed.

10731
11:26:55,630 --> 11:26:57,090
Rory, thank you for the 10 guppies!

10732
11:26:57,270 --> 11:26:57,790
Thank you.

10733
11:26:58,770 --> 11:27:00,450
The relationship went on.

10734
11:27:00,830 --> 11:27:02,770
Right into Project Babel.

10735
11:27:04,430 --> 11:27:06,010
Taking away Snake's coolness.

10736
11:27:06,090 --> 11:27:07,230
Yeah, I still did the job.

10737
11:27:07,950 --> 11:27:08,390
The U.S.

10738
11:27:08,470 --> 11:27:10,970
provided covert support for GILF.

10739
11:27:12,410 --> 11:27:14,110
I was their field controller.

10740
11:27:14,110 --> 11:27:20,310
The objective was diminishment of anti-American forces.

10741
11:27:21,650 --> 11:27:23,590
In the African continent.

10742
11:27:24,650 --> 11:27:27,590
Provoke an ethnic minority in Gindra.

10743
11:27:28,350 --> 11:27:30,070
Into a calculated conflict.

10744
11:27:30,890 --> 11:27:32,110
Then involve other...

10745
11:27:32,870 --> 11:27:34,830
Snake and Ocelot, my favorite GILFs.

10746
11:27:36,150 --> 11:27:37,690
Grandpa, you'd like to friend.

10747
11:27:38,950 --> 11:27:41,370
Then involve other neighboring nations.

10748
11:27:42,370 --> 11:27:48,130
Create a climate of hostility to discourage organized alliance.

10749
11:27:48,870 --> 11:27:56,830
Then send in a contingent of U.S.-dominated peacekeeping troops for an indefinite stay.

10750
11:27:58,750 --> 11:28:02,410
Where they can exercise control over the entire region.

10751
11:28:03,590 --> 11:28:06,550
It was a bid to build a new world order.

10752
11:28:07,390 --> 11:28:10,710
In the confusion of the post-Cold War era.

10753
11:28:11,970 --> 11:28:14,590
A means to establish the U.S.

10754
11:28:15,110 --> 11:28:16,400
as the sole superpower.

10755
11:28:17,710 --> 11:28:23,370
A single hegemony...

10756
11:28:26,390 --> 11:28:29,690
Over an artificial Babel.

10757
11:28:31,370 --> 11:28:33,390
Non-negotiable chaos.

10758
11:28:35,490 --> 11:28:37,370
This was Project Babel.

10759
11:28:37,850 --> 11:28:39,610
You can see how all this got wrecked on.

10760
11:28:39,610 --> 11:28:44,430
The brainchild of Parker, Army Chief of Staff.

10761
11:28:46,670 --> 11:28:50,830
The return for my services was a lavish reward.

10762
11:28:53,330 --> 11:28:54,290
Hegemony.

10763
11:28:56,230 --> 11:28:58,850
And guarantee of safety.

10764
11:28:59,610 --> 11:29:01,490
What is that?

10765
11:29:01,550 --> 11:29:02,630
The philosopher's legacy?

10766
11:29:03,250 --> 11:29:04,050
Take this.

10767
11:29:04,170 --> 11:29:06,750
This disc contains all the information.

10768
11:29:06,750 --> 11:29:13,430
That Parker ordered that woman soldier, Chris, to destroy.

10769
11:29:14,970 --> 11:29:16,250
It's all here.

10770
11:29:16,830 --> 11:29:19,170
Proof of what I have just told you.

10771
11:29:19,790 --> 11:29:23,770
Including details of all bank transactions.

10772
11:29:23,970 --> 11:29:25,890
Oh my gosh, it's basically the philosopher's legacy.

10773
11:29:26,710 --> 11:29:31,630
Oh my gosh, what if the last fight was just when him and Rock, Paper, Scissors.

10774
11:29:31,630 --> 11:29:40,690
There is enough dirt here to bring down some of the highest people in the government.

10775
11:29:43,550 --> 11:29:46,570
This is like a bomb ready to explode.

10776
11:29:51,290 --> 11:29:53,690
This too is the winner's privilege.

10777
11:29:54,730 --> 11:29:56,690
Sorry, I'm looking at the guide for how to beat him.

10778
11:29:58,150 --> 11:30:01,030
I have exactly a minute and a half to beat him.

10779
11:30:01,910 --> 11:30:02,510
Okay.

10780
11:30:03,530 --> 11:30:05,430
And I have to wear the thermal goggles.

10781
11:30:05,550 --> 11:30:05,930
Alright, cool.

10782
11:30:06,910 --> 11:30:08,390
Do with it what you like.

10783
11:30:09,130 --> 11:30:09,970
Okay, cool.

10784
11:30:10,110 --> 11:30:10,850
Then I'm going to leave.

10785
11:30:12,050 --> 11:30:14,270
You've deceived your people all this time.

10786
11:30:16,210 --> 11:30:18,250
Your followers believe in you.

10787
11:30:20,090 --> 11:30:21,270
So does Sophie.

10788
11:30:22,890 --> 11:30:24,450
Yes, Sophie.

10789
11:30:25,850 --> 11:30:28,030
I left her, cruelly too.

10790
11:30:28,030 --> 11:30:32,450
But still she stayed with me as my lieutenant.

10791
11:30:34,270 --> 11:30:38,170
But I never saw her smile after that.

10792
11:30:41,110 --> 11:30:42,510
I just saw her.

10793
11:30:42,590 --> 11:30:43,610
When did you see her again?

10794
11:30:44,250 --> 11:30:44,710
What do you mean?

10795
11:30:44,850 --> 11:30:47,890
It's been like an hour in game probably, right?

10796
11:30:48,250 --> 11:30:49,370
I didn't deceive them.

10797
11:30:49,590 --> 11:30:54,430
I had no intention of being Parker's henchman in the first place.

10798
11:30:54,430 --> 11:30:59,010
It was the aid I needed.

10799
11:30:59,410 --> 11:31:05,150
And with it, I was going to break the bargain and build our country.

10800
11:31:06,510 --> 11:31:08,390
The end justifies the means.

10801
11:31:08,970 --> 11:31:13,270
Especially when others have faith in the fiction.

10802
11:31:13,570 --> 11:31:14,030
Yikes.

10803
11:31:14,770 --> 11:31:15,670
This guy kind of sucks.

10804
11:31:16,330 --> 11:31:19,890
I only gave them the truth in the guise they wanted.

10805
11:31:19,890 --> 11:31:25,370
Can a nation built by those means have any value?

10806
11:31:25,950 --> 11:31:26,430
Said Snake.

10807
11:31:27,250 --> 11:31:29,850
Sorry, I can't do the voices anymore, guys.

10808
11:31:29,950 --> 11:31:30,470
My throat.

10809
11:31:31,850 --> 11:31:35,230
Doesn't the world operate on what you call those means?

10810
11:31:36,310 --> 11:31:36,810
Code Mercy!

10811
11:31:37,010 --> 11:31:37,730
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

10812
11:31:38,630 --> 11:31:40,290
Everyone just pretends otherwise.

10813
11:31:42,250 --> 11:31:46,410
Justice and ideals are nothing but words.

10814
11:31:47,470 --> 11:31:48,370
After all.

10815
11:31:51,690 --> 11:31:52,790
Well, well.

10816
11:31:53,450 --> 11:31:55,990
So this is the way dreams end.

10817
11:31:56,690 --> 11:32:00,230
Well, it is not the worst thing.

10818
11:32:08,450 --> 11:32:09,250
Kind.

10819
11:32:12,470 --> 11:32:15,110
Don't turn your back on this guy, little monkey.

10820
11:32:15,990 --> 11:32:16,750
Viper!

10821
11:32:18,370 --> 11:32:19,170
What?

10822
11:32:20,530 --> 11:32:21,410
What is he doing?

10823
11:32:22,370 --> 11:32:23,370
Oh, wait!

10824
11:32:23,530 --> 11:32:23,830
Viper!

10825
11:32:23,990 --> 11:32:24,630
Oh my gosh!

10826
11:32:25,810 --> 11:32:27,430
I told you, it's not over yet.

10827
11:32:27,590 --> 11:32:28,530
Oh my god.

10828
11:32:29,330 --> 11:32:30,030
No, wait.

10829
11:32:31,130 --> 11:32:32,250
I was thinking of General.

10830
11:32:32,550 --> 11:32:35,310
Wait, I'm fighting Viper?

10831
11:32:38,170 --> 11:32:38,670
Viper!

10832
11:32:39,010 --> 11:32:39,450
Still!

10833
11:32:42,450 --> 11:32:43,450
He's like...

10834
11:32:43,450 --> 11:32:45,070
You have blue eyes, Snake.

10835
11:32:45,310 --> 11:32:46,870
Just like my blue eyes white dragon.

10836
11:32:47,670 --> 11:32:48,850
It fills me with energy.

10837
11:32:48,850 --> 11:32:54,110
Thanks for saving me the trouble of removing the General.

10838
11:32:55,970 --> 11:32:58,970
He controlled Metal Gear to the end.

10839
11:32:59,830 --> 11:33:03,970
And I had the pleasure of listening to your conversation.

10840
11:33:06,910 --> 11:33:10,610
And so finally I know the identity of Anonymous.

10841
11:33:12,670 --> 11:33:18,830
It was worth the trouble of leading you all the way out here.

10842
11:33:20,410 --> 11:33:21,030
You?

10843
11:33:22,550 --> 11:33:27,970
This was all a ploy to bring Anonymous out into the open?

10844
11:33:29,430 --> 11:33:32,850
Everyone is like 10 steps ahead of each other.

10845
11:33:33,170 --> 11:33:35,100
But they're all like going in different directions.

10846
11:33:35,530 --> 11:33:38,100
I'm 10 steps ahead of you, going east.

10847
11:33:38,870 --> 11:33:42,770
And Viper's like, I'm 10 steps ahead of you, going west.

10848
11:33:43,070 --> 11:33:44,990
Like, it's ridiculous.

10849
11:33:46,170 --> 11:33:47,510
Seizure of Metal Gear.

10850
11:33:48,890 --> 11:33:52,730
Leading you and Campbell out here to Outer Heaven.

10851
11:33:54,550 --> 11:33:55,990
All part of the plan.

10852
11:33:56,170 --> 11:33:57,570
Of course it was.

10853
11:33:58,450 --> 11:34:01,530
You know what, if I ever get myself in some deep shit like this.

10854
11:34:01,550 --> 11:34:03,670
If I'm like, oh my god, I'm gonna die.

10855
11:34:04,070 --> 11:34:07,090
I'm the villain and everybody's figured out my plan.

10856
11:34:07,350 --> 11:34:08,850
I'm just gonna pretend that...

10857
11:34:10,910 --> 11:34:13,270
Whatever happened was according to my plan.

10858
11:34:15,130 --> 11:34:16,990
It seemed like I'm so smart.

10859
11:34:18,430 --> 11:34:19,570
Puddles, welcome to membership.

10860
11:34:19,770 --> 11:34:20,250
Thank you.

10861
11:34:23,110 --> 11:34:25,410
What does the colonel have to do with this?

10862
11:34:27,530 --> 11:34:30,050
I can't unsee Zoolander and Owen Wilson.

10863
11:34:31,490 --> 11:34:32,990
Oh my god, I see...

10864
11:34:34,790 --> 11:34:36,870
I see Owen Wilson too.

10865
11:34:38,430 --> 11:34:40,510
You don't know what he did?

10866
11:34:41,410 --> 11:34:49,290
Your dear friend Roy Campbell was in command of Foxhound that night two years ago.

10867
11:34:49,910 --> 11:34:51,110
Firedack, welcome to membership.

10868
11:34:51,450 --> 11:34:51,690
Thank you.

10869
11:34:52,810 --> 11:34:53,530
The colonel.

10870
11:34:55,050 --> 11:35:09,470
I figured that when Metal Gear's history repeated itself and you and Campbell were pulled into the fray, Anonymous would have to get involved.

10871
11:35:09,470 --> 11:35:13,130
Okay, I'm just gonna... Two years I have waited for this moment.

10872
11:35:13,610 --> 11:35:14,550
Two long years.

10873
11:35:15,010 --> 11:35:19,670
Damn it, the decision to call Campbell in and to send me was made at the highest level.

10874
11:35:21,730 --> 11:35:24,810
How could I have been involved in that process?

10875
11:35:25,230 --> 11:35:27,310
Mrs. Howe!

10876
11:35:27,350 --> 11:35:28,170
Part of greed.

10877
11:35:29,350 --> 11:35:30,690
Wait, is it Burger?

10878
11:35:31,670 --> 11:35:33,470
Snake, we have a problem.

10879
11:35:33,830 --> 11:35:35,650
Burger, Burger, Burger, Burger.

10880
11:35:36,130 --> 11:35:38,790
The fifth black chamber was Burger.

10881
11:35:39,470 --> 11:35:40,130
Hey, what?

10882
11:35:40,470 --> 11:35:40,930
It's Burger.

10883
11:35:41,210 --> 11:35:42,190
Burger, Burger.

10884
11:35:42,870 --> 11:35:44,370
Colonel, what's going on?

10885
11:35:44,490 --> 11:35:45,530
Burger, Burger, Burger.

10886
11:35:45,770 --> 11:35:48,850
The fifth black chamber was right here.

10887
11:35:49,270 --> 11:35:50,670
This is so silly.

10888
11:35:51,370 --> 11:35:52,430
Who is this?

10889
11:35:52,990 --> 11:35:53,410
Burger!

10890
11:35:54,110 --> 11:35:59,670
I won!

10891
11:36:10,760 --> 11:36:11,360
Guess who?

10892
11:36:14,320 --> 11:36:15,460
Nick Burger!

10893
11:36:16,720 --> 11:36:18,720
Surprise, Snake.

10894
11:36:19,820 --> 11:36:27,200
After I survived two years ago, I parted from the others and slipped into your side.

10895
11:36:27,720 --> 11:36:29,180
I changed everything.

10896
11:36:29,700 --> 11:36:34,880
My face name passed... Oh my god, you gave yourself that face?

10897
11:36:35,360 --> 11:36:35,700
Burger!

10898
11:36:36,780 --> 11:36:38,240
Thank you, Puddles!

10899
11:36:38,780 --> 11:36:40,140
First McDonald's, then McBurger.

10900
11:36:40,140 --> 11:36:44,620
To gather information for our cause.

10901
11:36:45,240 --> 11:36:47,280
Everything I did was for this moment.

10902
11:36:47,660 --> 11:36:48,600
Do it, Viper!

10903
11:36:48,880 --> 11:36:49,640
This is it!

10904
11:36:51,080 --> 11:36:52,000
Oh my gosh.

10905
11:36:53,540 --> 11:36:59,160
You may forget or refuse to acknowledge it, but our hell goes on.

10906
11:37:00,440 --> 11:37:02,120
Thank you, Viper.

10907
11:37:02,420 --> 11:37:05,960
Yes, my hell does go on because there is one more fight.

10908
11:37:05,960 --> 11:37:10,240
And it will go on until we destroy all of you.

10909
11:37:10,760 --> 11:37:11,960
Not just Anonymous.

10910
11:37:15,860 --> 11:37:17,960
What did you just do?

10911
11:37:19,800 --> 11:37:21,500
The Bolts of Vengeance.

10912
11:37:24,160 --> 11:37:26,260
Preparing for nuclear strike.

10913
11:37:28,680 --> 11:37:30,120
How can that be?

10914
11:37:30,540 --> 11:37:31,900
Metal Gear was destroyed.

10915
11:37:32,600 --> 11:37:36,000
You should have gotten the other plate, Dumbo.

10916
11:37:38,680 --> 11:37:39,340
You are a fool.

10917
11:37:39,920 --> 11:37:44,820
Did you think Metal Gear was just an armored transport for a nuclear payload?

10918
11:37:45,620 --> 11:37:45,820
What?

10919
11:37:46,660 --> 11:37:53,720
The nature of this beast is an integrated launch system with real-time relay control of seven armed satellites.

10920
11:37:54,120 --> 11:37:55,820
All with nuclear capability.

10921
11:37:56,260 --> 11:37:58,820
The railgun is just a cherry on top.

10922
11:38:00,740 --> 11:38:02,180
Armed satellites?

10923
11:38:03,480 --> 11:38:06,080
Nuclear strike from planetary orbit?

10924
11:38:07,320 --> 11:38:07,880
That's right.

10925
11:38:08,120 --> 11:38:12,840
Able to strike on any point of Earth without relying on ICBMs.

10926
11:38:12,840 --> 11:38:14,720
And impossible to defend against.

10927
11:38:16,220 --> 11:38:17,380
The railgun's a cherry?

10928
11:38:17,740 --> 11:38:18,300
Yummy.

10929
11:38:19,640 --> 11:38:21,080
Space nukes.

10930
11:38:22,420 --> 11:38:25,860
You're going to murder millions of innocent people.

10931
11:38:25,860 --> 11:38:28,280
For your personal vengeance?

10932
11:38:29,040 --> 11:38:29,620
Innocent?

10933
11:38:30,080 --> 11:38:32,880
Crising on spoon-fed justice and order?

10934
11:38:33,360 --> 11:38:36,700
Content to ignore what goes on behind the fine words?

10935
11:38:37,600 --> 11:38:39,720
Their crime is equal to that of Anonymous.

10936
11:38:41,000 --> 11:38:41,280
No.

10937
11:38:42,120 --> 11:38:46,540
Their complacency is what makes Anonymous possible.

10938
11:38:47,680 --> 11:38:49,120
He's losing me.

10939
11:38:49,700 --> 11:38:52,360
This strike is for my murdered comrades.

10940
11:38:52,860 --> 11:38:55,020
But that won't be the end.

10941
11:38:55,020 --> 11:38:57,120
This is a declaration of war.

10942
11:38:57,840 --> 11:38:58,860
Against Anonymous.

10943
11:39:09,930 --> 11:39:10,450
OK.

10944
11:39:11,670 --> 11:39:12,690
This is so silly.

10945
11:39:12,870 --> 11:39:13,550
I love it though.

10946
11:39:13,690 --> 11:39:14,010
Of course.

10947
11:39:14,130 --> 11:39:14,610
It's Metal Gear.

10948
11:39:14,670 --> 11:39:15,290
It's going to be silly.

10949
11:39:16,010 --> 11:39:16,570
What is that?

10950
11:39:19,850 --> 11:39:22,450
I've just activated my trap card.

10951
11:39:25,630 --> 11:39:27,490
I just activated the elevator.

10952
11:39:28,570 --> 11:39:31,620
Once Metal Gear is out on the surface...

10953
11:39:35,470 --> 11:39:38,210
Black Chamber is kind of dead cell coded.

10954
11:39:38,970 --> 11:39:39,710
Maybe.

10955
11:39:41,050 --> 11:39:42,490
I feel like all...

10956
11:39:43,070 --> 11:39:47,590
I feel like all the groups besides Cobra Unit are very similar, right?

10957
11:39:48,590 --> 11:39:52,490
Its signals will be transmitted and those...

10958
11:39:53,030 --> 11:39:56,250
7 satellites will enter attack mode.

10959
11:39:58,050 --> 11:39:59,590
In 90 seconds.

10960
11:40:01,350 --> 11:40:02,950
I will stop you.

10961
11:40:03,810 --> 11:40:04,790
OK, Snake.

10962
11:40:05,090 --> 11:40:06,230
Give it your best shot.

10963
11:40:07,130 --> 11:40:08,610
This is your last fight.

10964
11:40:09,150 --> 11:40:09,910
Come on!

10965
11:40:11,230 --> 11:40:11,850
OK.

10966
11:40:12,930 --> 11:40:13,550
Alright.

10967
11:40:13,750 --> 11:40:15,250
So, from here...

10968
11:40:16,210 --> 11:40:18,870
I still have a ration, I believe.

10969
11:40:19,410 --> 11:40:20,230
Or not.

10970
11:40:20,370 --> 11:40:20,890
Oh, I do?

10971
11:40:21,030 --> 11:40:21,270
OK.

10972
11:40:21,390 --> 11:40:21,830
Thank goodness.

10973
11:40:22,350 --> 11:40:24,430
And then...

10974
11:40:24,430 --> 11:40:26,470
I get...

10975
11:40:26,470 --> 11:40:27,510
My R... Wait.

10976
11:40:27,770 --> 11:40:28,290
What do I get?

10977
11:40:29,070 --> 11:40:29,950
The F7.

10978
11:40:30,290 --> 11:40:31,050
Or 5-7.

10979
11:40:31,470 --> 11:40:32,650
Is what it's recommending.

10980
11:40:34,430 --> 11:40:35,750
I guess I can do that.

10981
11:40:35,870 --> 11:40:36,890
Which one's...

10982
11:40:36,890 --> 11:40:38,390
Which one shoots better?

10983
11:40:39,310 --> 11:40:39,870
R5?

10984
11:40:41,450 --> 11:40:42,850
You seriously aren't done?

10985
11:40:42,990 --> 11:40:43,350
No!

10986
11:40:43,510 --> 11:40:45,210
This is the final, final boss!

10987
11:40:47,370 --> 11:40:48,270
Assault rifle.

10988
11:40:50,570 --> 11:40:51,130
OK.

10989
11:40:51,330 --> 11:40:52,350
So, he turns invisible.

10990
11:40:52,350 --> 11:40:55,230
Do you think that I fight dirty?

10991
11:40:56,210 --> 11:41:00,330
If I use any means, I see fit to carry out our revenge.

10992
11:41:01,190 --> 11:41:01,370
OK.

10993
11:41:02,290 --> 11:41:03,690
Now we... Wait.

10994
11:41:04,190 --> 11:41:04,770
R5.

10995
11:41:07,350 --> 11:41:08,850
And thermal goggles.

10996
11:41:10,990 --> 11:41:11,570
Where are you?

10997
11:41:12,350 --> 11:41:13,110
Where are you?

10998
11:41:13,430 --> 11:41:14,430
Where are you?

10999
11:41:15,030 --> 11:41:15,750
Where are you?

11000
11:41:15,990 --> 11:41:17,450
Oh, there you are.

11001
11:41:26,910 --> 11:41:30,110
We will have our vengeance no matter what!

11002
11:41:30,250 --> 11:41:30,770
Oh gosh.

11003
11:41:31,050 --> 11:41:33,750
Oh, that doesn't do so much... As much damage as I wish it would.

11004
11:41:42,010 --> 11:41:44,710
Please, God!

11005
11:41:45,470 --> 11:41:47,950
Oh my God, he's just a slippery little man.

11006
11:41:48,450 --> 11:41:49,570
Viper, you snake!

11007
11:41:50,990 --> 11:41:52,010
Oh my God.

11008
11:41:52,250 --> 11:41:54,270
Oh my God, he's so slippery.

11009
11:41:54,270 --> 11:41:55,310
Bing!

11010
11:41:56,370 --> 11:41:56,870
Hurry!

11011
11:41:57,070 --> 11:41:57,930
I'm trying!

11012
11:41:58,170 --> 11:41:59,150
Oh my God!

11013
11:42:04,440 --> 11:42:06,140
Where the hell is he?

11014
11:42:08,880 --> 11:42:09,940
Where'd he go?

11015
11:42:25,020 --> 11:42:27,140
My every move...

11016
11:42:27,140 --> 11:42:29,860
...is a testament to my comrades... I'm not gonna make it, I think.

11017
11:42:30,360 --> 11:42:30,780
Oh God.

11018
11:42:34,480 --> 11:42:35,040
Shit.

11019
11:42:35,040 --> 11:42:35,080
What?

11020
11:42:39,570 --> 11:42:42,190
No, this is the end of the road everybody.

11021
11:42:42,790 --> 11:42:43,550
We got him?

11022
11:42:46,070 --> 11:42:48,630
I will see, but I don't... Sorry, I don't care.

11023
11:42:51,090 --> 11:42:51,890
Oh my God.

11024
11:42:55,620 --> 11:42:56,440
Two seconds?

11025
11:43:01,080 --> 11:43:02,480
Do you think that I fight dirty?

11026
11:43:02,880 --> 11:43:03,220
Yeah.

11027
11:43:03,880 --> 11:43:04,560
Oh, there it is.

11028
11:43:04,960 --> 11:43:07,160
Wow, I got through this cutscene immediately.

11029
11:43:07,800 --> 11:43:09,180
We're above ground!

11030
11:43:10,100 --> 11:43:14,440
The command has been relayed to the attack satellites just now.

11031
11:43:14,560 --> 11:43:14,960
Oh, sorry.

11032
11:43:15,060 --> 11:43:16,600
The nuclear something-something-something vengeance!

11033
11:43:18,520 --> 11:43:19,080
OK.

11034
11:43:20,820 --> 11:43:22,400
Does the gun do more damage?

11035
11:43:22,480 --> 11:43:23,280
Let's check it out.

11036
11:43:24,300 --> 11:43:25,080
OK, good.

11037
11:43:25,100 --> 11:43:25,860
It starts from here.

11038
11:43:27,280 --> 11:43:28,280
This isn't so bad.

11039
11:43:35,680 --> 11:43:36,240
Item.

11040
11:43:37,320 --> 11:43:38,380
Let's try the pistol.

11041
11:43:40,560 --> 11:43:43,320
And our thermal goggles.

11042
11:43:49,920 --> 11:43:51,980
It's hard to tell where he starts.

11043
11:44:06,900 --> 11:44:08,080
Slightly more maybe?

11044
11:44:10,460 --> 11:44:14,620
What does the anonymous mass hacking group have to do with this game's story plot?

11045
11:44:15,420 --> 11:44:17,620
No, it's not actually them.

11046
11:44:18,820 --> 11:44:19,420
It's...

11047
11:44:20,300 --> 11:44:20,940
Nice.

11048
11:44:21,780 --> 11:44:24,000
It's a guy named Anonymous.

11049
11:44:25,080 --> 11:44:27,140
Victory is ours in 68 seconds.

11050
11:44:27,300 --> 11:44:28,060
OK, buddy.

11051
11:44:30,580 --> 11:44:31,060
Eat shit.

11052
11:44:31,340 --> 11:44:31,780
Eat shit.

11053
11:44:32,100 --> 11:44:32,680
Eat shit.

11054
11:44:34,520 --> 11:44:37,140
Every move is a buglelelelelele.

11055
11:44:37,460 --> 11:44:38,300
Oh shit.

11056
11:44:38,800 --> 11:44:38,980
Wait.

11057
11:44:39,400 --> 11:44:39,840
Oh God.

11058
11:44:40,280 --> 11:44:42,440
Slippery, slimy, slimy sucker.

11059
11:44:43,880 --> 11:44:44,980
I'm always chasing...

11060
11:44:44,980 --> 11:44:46,580
He doesn't attack.

11061
11:44:46,700 --> 11:44:47,520
Oh, there we go.

11062
11:44:48,100 --> 11:44:49,140
Oh my goodness.

11063
11:44:49,240 --> 11:44:50,120
His attack kinda hit.

11064
11:44:50,920 --> 11:44:51,540
We'll see.

11065
11:44:52,040 --> 11:44:52,520
Blahblahblahblah.

11066
11:44:52,760 --> 11:44:53,220
I don't care.

11067
11:44:53,840 --> 11:44:54,320
Sorry.

11068
11:44:54,960 --> 11:44:56,280
I don't care about what you have to say.

11069
11:44:57,360 --> 11:44:58,160
Where are you?

11070
11:44:59,220 --> 11:44:59,940
Where'd he go?

11071
11:45:00,760 --> 11:45:01,640
Where the hell is he?

11072
11:45:02,080 --> 11:45:03,380
Guys, I lost him.

11073
11:45:04,220 --> 11:45:05,280
Guys, where is he?

11074
11:45:06,120 --> 11:45:06,740
Oh my God.

11075
11:45:14,810 --> 11:45:15,850
Just keep blasting.

11076
11:45:15,930 --> 11:45:16,410
I'm trying.

11077
11:45:18,110 --> 11:45:20,510
It might be... We might get him.

11078
11:45:23,290 --> 11:45:23,950
Nice.

11079
11:45:26,410 --> 11:45:26,670
OK.

11080
11:45:27,010 --> 11:45:30,490
20 seconds, but maybe one more hit if I can get him.

11081
11:45:31,110 --> 11:45:31,350
Please.

11082
11:45:31,950 --> 11:45:32,130
Please.

11083
11:45:32,910 --> 11:45:33,230
Yes!

11084
11:45:37,990 --> 11:45:38,650
Terrible!

11085
11:45:42,360 --> 11:45:45,080
How fast do you expect me to beat him?

11086
11:45:45,700 --> 11:45:47,760
And the VOD is saved.

11087
11:45:48,360 --> 11:45:50,120
I've shut the controls down.

11088
11:45:50,900 --> 11:45:52,580
There is no way to launch now.

11089
11:45:53,660 --> 11:45:54,300
I'm out.

11090
11:45:54,780 --> 11:45:56,240
Thank you for the superchat!

11091
11:45:56,740 --> 11:45:57,920
Welcome to the map-o-ship!

11092
11:45:58,820 --> 11:46:00,200
Terrible to the end, baby!

11093
11:46:00,420 --> 11:46:01,740
Terrible to the end!

11094
11:46:02,480 --> 11:46:04,660
Hopefully this isn't a 15 minute...

11095
11:46:04,660 --> 11:46:06,600
How could I be beaten by you?

11096
11:46:06,700 --> 11:46:06,880
OK.

11097
11:46:06,920 --> 11:46:08,360
We're gonna have to speedrun this ending a little bit.

11098
11:46:08,580 --> 11:46:10,480
Snake, how do you do it?

11099
11:46:10,740 --> 11:46:12,060
How do you keep fighting?

11100
11:46:12,600 --> 11:46:13,020
Living?

11101
11:46:14,300 --> 11:46:15,100
For what?

11102
11:46:15,700 --> 11:46:16,180
Whom?

11103
11:46:17,400 --> 11:46:19,340
In the name of what cause?

11104
11:46:22,400 --> 11:46:23,060
It's over.

11105
11:46:23,400 --> 11:46:25,880
My comrades, I didn't do right by you at all.

11106
11:46:25,920 --> 11:46:27,160
This is so beautiful by the way.

11107
11:46:27,260 --> 11:46:29,060
Like the sunset is so pretty.

11108
11:46:29,400 --> 11:46:30,280
Goodbye Viper.

11109
11:46:30,540 --> 11:46:31,800
I don't feel sad at all.

11110
11:46:33,120 --> 11:46:33,600
Viper.

11111
11:46:35,240 --> 11:46:36,320
Who's walking over here?

11112
11:46:37,520 --> 11:46:37,740
Hello?

11113
11:46:38,760 --> 11:46:39,400
Oh, curse.

11114
11:46:39,740 --> 11:46:40,440
Sophie, just kidding.

11115
11:46:40,640 --> 11:46:40,980
Snake!

11116
11:46:43,040 --> 11:46:43,820
Oh no.

11117
11:46:44,180 --> 11:46:45,160
Sophie is also pregnant.

11118
11:46:45,580 --> 11:46:46,060
It's you.

11119
11:46:49,450 --> 11:46:51,150
They did a good job with the graphics.

11120
11:46:51,330 --> 11:46:51,950
They really did.

11121
11:46:53,170 --> 11:46:53,730
The general.

11122
11:46:54,570 --> 11:46:55,090
Terrible.

11123
11:46:55,630 --> 11:46:56,070
I heard.

11124
11:46:56,230 --> 11:46:56,830
All of it.

11125
11:46:57,010 --> 11:46:58,990
Including the part about GILF in the US.

11126
11:47:00,250 --> 11:47:00,750
I see.

11127
11:47:01,230 --> 11:47:02,110
What will you do now?

11128
11:47:05,930 --> 11:47:06,450
Hello?

11129
11:47:06,870 --> 11:47:07,270
There we go.

11130
11:47:07,530 --> 11:47:08,150
Stay here.

11131
11:47:09,630 --> 11:47:10,530
With GILF?

11132
11:47:10,530 --> 11:47:12,410
She's staying with her GILF.

11133
11:47:13,250 --> 11:47:14,510
Next time the bonus missions?

11134
11:47:14,810 --> 11:47:15,170
Maybe.

11135
11:47:15,310 --> 11:47:15,730
We'll see.

11136
11:47:16,950 --> 11:47:18,630
Continue the general's work?

11137
11:47:20,610 --> 11:47:24,590
Right now, I don't even know whether I loved him or hated him.

11138
11:47:25,370 --> 11:47:27,330
I just couldn't leave his side.

11139
11:47:30,110 --> 11:47:33,650
His ideals may have been faked, but they weren't empty.

11140
11:47:34,450 --> 11:47:35,370
That's what I think.

11141
11:47:35,990 --> 11:47:39,150
And there are many here still who believe that too.

11142
11:47:39,150 --> 11:47:41,330
Worth ruining my sleep schedule.

11143
11:47:41,450 --> 11:47:41,650
No!

11144
11:47:42,470 --> 11:47:43,370
Me too though.

11145
11:47:44,090 --> 11:47:45,810
We'll work together to build a country.

11146
11:47:46,490 --> 11:47:47,230
Of our own.

11147
11:47:47,350 --> 11:47:48,210
For ourselves.

11148
11:47:48,710 --> 11:47:50,510
This time with real ideals.

11149
11:47:56,010 --> 11:47:57,610
And there is Chris.

11150
11:47:58,030 --> 11:47:58,630
Snake!

11151
11:47:59,770 --> 11:48:00,650
Oh she found a car.

11152
11:48:00,750 --> 11:48:01,090
Nice.

11153
11:48:01,750 --> 11:48:02,210
It's her.

11154
11:48:03,130 --> 11:48:04,190
Don't keep her waiting.

11155
11:48:06,830 --> 11:48:07,870
I won't.

11156
11:48:10,410 --> 11:48:10,890
Nice.

11157
11:48:12,350 --> 11:48:14,370
This is so much for a game boy.

11158
11:48:14,410 --> 11:48:15,430
I can't get over it.

11159
11:48:16,030 --> 11:48:17,210
He called your name, you know.

11160
11:48:17,870 --> 11:48:18,730
At the end.

11161
11:48:18,870 --> 11:48:19,590
No he didn't.

11162
11:48:22,330 --> 11:48:23,010
Did he?

11163
11:48:24,430 --> 11:48:27,190
Snake is always giving people false hope.

11164
11:48:28,150 --> 11:48:29,130
He's such a good guy.

11165
11:48:32,270 --> 11:48:32,750
Snake!

11166
11:48:33,210 --> 11:48:33,930
Amazing mint.

11167
11:48:34,070 --> 11:48:34,930
Thank you, Sova!

11168
11:48:36,710 --> 11:48:37,790
I got us a jeep.

11169
11:48:39,150 --> 11:48:39,910
Good work.

11170
11:48:40,750 --> 11:48:41,610
Is it over?

11171
11:48:41,930 --> 11:48:42,270
Yes!

11172
11:48:42,430 --> 11:48:43,530
It's all over!

11173
11:48:44,870 --> 11:48:45,770
Is it?

11174
11:48:48,270 --> 11:48:49,450
What a great stream.

11175
11:48:49,570 --> 11:48:50,250
Thank you!

11176
11:48:51,910 --> 11:48:53,050
What about her?

11177
11:48:54,030 --> 11:48:54,790
She's strong.

11178
11:48:55,490 --> 11:48:56,850
And she'll become even stronger.

11179
11:48:57,850 --> 11:48:59,810
You don't have to go with her?

11180
11:49:01,030 --> 11:49:01,970
To GILF?

11181
11:49:02,030 --> 11:49:02,350
Why?

11182
11:49:03,890 --> 11:49:05,090
Nothing really.

11183
11:49:05,710 --> 11:49:06,510
Let's get out of here.

11184
11:49:07,550 --> 11:49:07,990
Right.

11185
11:49:09,390 --> 11:49:10,090
Oh colonel.

11186
11:49:11,550 --> 11:49:12,650
There's the codec.

11187
11:49:13,650 --> 11:49:15,010
She won't ever show up again.

11188
11:49:15,110 --> 11:49:16,130
I only have 10 minutes, please!

11189
11:49:17,990 --> 11:49:18,330
Snake!

11190
11:49:18,490 --> 11:49:19,530
Colonel, everything alright?

11191
11:49:20,690 --> 11:49:22,990
Yeah, I put a bullet in McBurger.

11192
11:49:23,390 --> 11:49:24,410
Ok, Weasel.

11193
11:49:24,590 --> 11:49:24,830
You?

11194
11:49:25,590 --> 11:49:27,070
Snake, I owe you an apology.

11195
11:49:27,730 --> 11:49:30,830
It's true that I was in charge of Black Chamber's termination.

11196
11:49:31,570 --> 11:49:34,210
We were told that there was a terrorist group coming in.

11197
11:49:34,210 --> 11:49:36,610
Secret liquidation on a dark night.

11198
11:49:37,210 --> 11:49:41,710
Only when it was all over was I told that the target had been one of our own.

11199
11:49:42,090 --> 11:49:43,130
An American unit.

11200
11:49:44,630 --> 11:49:46,130
Was that the reason for your retirement?

11201
11:49:46,830 --> 11:49:47,330
Yes.

11202
11:49:48,290 --> 11:49:51,350
I lived with the guilt these two years.

11203
11:49:51,870 --> 11:49:54,570
Colonel is always getting screwed over just like us.

11204
11:49:55,530 --> 11:50:00,390
But when they hijacked Metal Gear, I was called in by NSA chief Steve Gardner.

11205
11:50:01,610 --> 11:50:02,690
The mission controller.

11206
11:50:02,690 --> 11:50:05,810
Mint is a freak, not lewd, just endurance wise.

11207
11:50:07,350 --> 11:50:08,870
The mission controller.

11208
11:50:10,210 --> 11:50:12,250
So you took the job to confront the past.

11209
11:50:12,890 --> 11:50:17,230
A job which was offered to me with the alternative of making the incident public.

11210
11:50:17,850 --> 11:50:21,650
Along with evidence that it was I who planned the thing.

11211
11:50:21,930 --> 11:50:22,450
The thing.

11212
11:50:22,990 --> 11:50:23,810
Blackmail, huh?

11213
11:50:24,710 --> 11:50:26,330
But how would Gardner know about that?

11214
11:50:27,170 --> 11:50:28,730
Probably dug it up somewhere.

11215
11:50:29,690 --> 11:50:31,410
He is a former CIA director.

11216
11:50:31,410 --> 11:50:33,190
Former DCI.

11217
11:50:33,630 --> 11:50:34,870
Don't tell me.

11218
11:50:35,370 --> 11:50:40,990
Seven years ago, during the Outer Heaven incident, who was the DDCI?

11219
11:50:42,090 --> 11:50:43,950
Now you've got it.

11220
11:50:47,680 --> 11:50:48,420
Sorry.

11221
11:50:48,920 --> 11:50:52,340
Gardner was deputy director of central intelligence, alright?

11222
11:50:52,920 --> 11:50:53,340
Weasel.

11223
11:50:54,100 --> 11:50:58,420
He was the one who organized Outer Heaven and the development of Metal Gear.

11224
11:51:00,360 --> 11:51:01,540
Oh my god.

11225
11:51:02,080 --> 11:51:06,340
Metal Gear used to be under CIA control, like Viper said.

11226
11:51:07,120 --> 11:51:08,800
Rest in pepperoni, McBurger.

11227
11:51:09,300 --> 11:51:11,300
More like rest in pickles.

11228
11:51:12,100 --> 11:51:14,240
I love pickles on a burger.

11229
11:51:15,020 --> 11:51:20,020
Gardner was also the one who salvaged the Metal Gear you totaled from Outer Heaven...

11230
11:51:20,020 --> 11:51:21,660
and continued the development program.

11231
11:51:22,080 --> 11:51:23,760
Thank you for the Akasupa.

11232
11:51:24,340 --> 11:51:26,460
This has been a wild 12 hour ride, but it was worth it.

11233
11:51:26,560 --> 11:51:28,180
Never get tired watching you play Metal Gear.

11234
11:51:28,180 --> 11:51:30,460
I'll donate more to MGSCon later this week.

11235
11:51:30,820 --> 11:51:32,100
So we can see you there.

11236
11:51:32,200 --> 11:51:33,780
No, thank you though.

11237
11:51:35,080 --> 11:51:36,180
Thank you, thank you.

11238
11:51:37,960 --> 11:51:41,200
In other words, Project Babel was actually his idea.

11239
11:51:42,220 --> 11:51:45,440
But two years ago, Metal Gear was seized by foreign terrorists...

11240
11:51:45,440 --> 11:51:49,180
and as a result, the control of the weapon and the leadership project Babel...

11241
11:51:49,940 --> 11:51:51,300
was transferred away to Parker.

11242
11:51:51,900 --> 11:51:53,300
The real gilf was Sophie.

11243
11:51:53,760 --> 11:51:54,320
Yeah.

11244
11:51:54,980 --> 11:51:55,940
And the army.

11245
11:51:57,160 --> 11:52:01,340
And Gardner had Black Chamber erased to ensure their silence.

11246
11:52:03,100 --> 11:52:04,100
Gardner is anonymous?

11247
11:52:05,880 --> 11:52:07,440
Weasel, you're not.

11248
11:52:09,100 --> 11:52:10,960
Under Gardner's direct command?

11249
11:52:11,640 --> 11:52:12,800
You guessed it, Snake.

11250
11:52:13,680 --> 11:52:13,940
What?

11251
11:52:14,860 --> 11:52:16,120
And another thing.

11252
11:52:16,820 --> 11:52:19,140
Gardner knew who McBride was from the beginning.

11253
11:52:20,360 --> 11:52:21,140
What?

11254
11:52:21,140 --> 11:52:21,260
What?

11255
11:52:22,260 --> 11:52:27,160
Well, it was Gardner who leaked the intel about Metal Gear to McBurger...

11256
11:52:27,160 --> 11:52:29,460
and Black Chamber to begin with.

11257
11:52:29,540 --> 11:52:30,340
Oh my god.

11258
11:52:31,680 --> 11:52:32,680
For what purpose?

11259
11:52:34,180 --> 11:52:35,100
I see it.

11260
11:52:35,860 --> 11:52:38,560
Gardner was setting Parker up.

11261
11:52:39,440 --> 11:52:43,760
It's really hard for me to keep track of these people when I don't have a face for Parker...

11262
11:52:43,760 --> 11:52:45,780
I don't have a face for Gardner, things like that.

11263
11:52:46,520 --> 11:52:46,980
Right.

11264
11:52:47,580 --> 11:52:51,980
If gilf seizes Metal Gear and goes out of control...

11265
11:52:52,760 --> 11:52:56,620
the blame will land on Parker with his long time aide to gilf.

11266
11:52:57,720 --> 11:53:02,320
And Metal Gear Project Babel will return happily ever after to Gardner's arms.

11267
11:53:02,360 --> 11:53:04,580
Yeah, I'm gonna have to read up on the story after this.

11268
11:53:04,940 --> 11:53:09,760
Some parts are, especially because I'm tired now, some parts are flying over my head.

11269
11:53:10,760 --> 11:53:14,740
Could he possibly have engineered Black Chamber's contact with gilf?

11270
11:53:17,680 --> 11:53:20,100
I don't know, but it could be.

11271
11:53:20,680 --> 11:53:22,520
That Gardner planned this whole thing?

11272
11:53:23,000 --> 11:53:24,980
Just to regain Metal Gear and Project Babel?

11273
11:53:25,660 --> 11:53:27,000
Oh god, oh hi Meiling.

11274
11:53:27,520 --> 11:53:31,680
Weasel, if you're under orders from Gardner, don't you have another job to carry out?

11275
11:53:31,960 --> 11:53:33,980
To kill us all once the mission has succeeded?

11276
11:53:34,440 --> 11:53:35,580
Yeah, but he's a weasel.

11277
11:53:36,040 --> 11:53:38,140
Sharp Snake, that's exactly right.

11278
11:53:38,860 --> 11:53:42,760
So that's the real reason a mercenary of your standing wasn't sent on the field?

11279
11:53:43,540 --> 11:53:44,360
Right again.

11280
11:53:44,700 --> 11:53:46,280
But he's a weasel and can't be trusted.

11281
11:53:47,520 --> 11:53:50,960
I'm about the only person who can take on the legend.

11282
11:53:52,520 --> 11:53:54,300
Weasel, you're going to kill us?

11283
11:53:55,080 --> 11:53:58,540
Like I said, it's a policy of mine to earn my keep.

11284
11:53:59,280 --> 11:54:00,360
How can you?

11285
11:54:01,200 --> 11:54:06,140
So I'd like to say, but unfortunately, I kind of like you people.

11286
11:54:07,720 --> 11:54:09,880
Especially your bleeding heart ways.

11287
11:54:10,380 --> 11:54:12,660
Totally wrong for a combat situation, you know.

11288
11:54:12,660 --> 11:54:14,220
It's been a while.

11289
11:54:14,420 --> 11:54:17,540
It's been a while since I met people like you.

11290
11:54:18,200 --> 11:54:18,720
Weasel.

11291
11:54:20,180 --> 11:54:21,420
Get out of here.

11292
11:54:22,500 --> 11:54:24,600
I'll feed some story to Gardner.

11293
11:54:25,140 --> 11:54:28,740
Probably get only half my pay for letting you escape, but who cares.

11294
11:54:29,720 --> 11:54:30,740
Are you going to be alright?

11295
11:54:31,200 --> 11:54:32,240
You could be in danger.

11296
11:54:33,360 --> 11:54:35,060
I know how to take care of myself.

11297
11:54:35,560 --> 11:54:36,520
Don't you worry.

11298
11:54:36,900 --> 11:54:39,220
We never got a game to fight Weasel.

11299
11:54:39,680 --> 11:54:40,600
Thank you, Weasel.

11300
11:54:40,600 --> 11:54:41,620
I quit.

11301
11:54:41,700 --> 11:54:43,360
Don't think I can take it seriously though.

11302
11:54:44,060 --> 11:54:45,800
I'll repay the debt someday.

11303
11:54:46,020 --> 11:54:48,260
Except he doesn't, because Weasel never shows up again.

11304
11:54:49,080 --> 11:54:50,460
I won't be counting on it.

11305
11:54:50,760 --> 11:54:58,140
If I could live the way you people do, maybe I wouldn't have had to let my brother die.
