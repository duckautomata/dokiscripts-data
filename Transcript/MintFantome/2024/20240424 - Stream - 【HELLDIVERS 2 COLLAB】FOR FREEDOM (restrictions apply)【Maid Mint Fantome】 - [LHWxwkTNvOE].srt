1
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,580
Whoopsie, whoopsie, whoopsie.

2
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,820
I said, I said, man, I missed my joke.

3
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,500
Okay, hold on.

4
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,880
Redo, redo, redo, redo.

5
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,220
Okay.

6
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,520
Oh, that was it.

7
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,640
But I don't think it worked so well the second time.

8
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,310
Goodwin?

9
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,150

You guys aren't booing at all!

14
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,170
You hate it!

15
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:27,930

17
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,750
You're not booing at all!

18
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,090
I get it!

19
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,130
It's a good joke!

20
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:38,980
Boo?

21
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,440
Boo for real?

22
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,880
Boo for real?

23
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,360
Yay!

24
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,340
I was saying boo.

25
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,120
Yay!

26
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,440

27
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,980
And there you go, thank you for the 10 gifted!

28
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,420
Hello everybody, welcome to Hell Divers.

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,760
Today I will be playing with Matara, with Haruka, and...

And...

32
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,580
Uh...

33
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,400
And...

34
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,500
Uh...

35
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,140

38
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,800
But it'll be fine.

39
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,520
It'll be okay.

40
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,760
If you're wondering where are those funny people at?

41
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:59,780
I'll tell you, I'm playing the tutorial first, and people
wanted to see a video, but it starts as soon as I, like,

42
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,520
open the game.

43
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,480
So I was like, close the game.

44
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,540
And so now I'm going to start the game.

45
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,880
Play.

46
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,840
That's why we're on, been on a black screen this whole time.

47
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,800
I hope it'll capture.

48
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,680
Right?

49
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,360
It'll capture, right?

50
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,800
Oh, yes.

51
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,900
Oh, it's, oh.

52
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,040
Oh,

53
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:30,680
no.

54
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
Can't, can't, can't, can't capture.

55
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,660
Oh, ah, ah, that's there, it's there.

56
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:33,900
Okay.

57
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,600
Super Earth Ministry of Truth.

58
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,580
Semper.

59
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,220
Super Earth.

60
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,460
Whoa.

61
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,060
Super Earth.

62
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,960
Am I lagging?

63
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,880
Our home.

64
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,980
A tiny bit.

65
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,280
Prosperity.

66
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,760
Hi there.

67
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,080
Oh my god, neighborhood.

68
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:57,940
Friendly.

69
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:58,600
Oh.

70
00:06:59,480 --> 00:06:59,660
Democracy.

71
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,420
Our way of life.

72
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,460
Oh, we're a happy family.

73
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

74
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,000
No, sweet liberty.

75
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,360
No, no, the liberty.

76
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,380
Invasion.

77
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,940
Oh my god, he's in grief.

78
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,260
He's in so much grief, he's hallucinating his family.

79
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,360
You could be next.

80
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,020
Me?

81
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,440
That is, unless you make the most important decision of your
life.

82
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,200
What's that?

83
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,040
Shaves my head?

84
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,260
The strength and the courage to be free.

85
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,980
I'm free, I'm free.

86
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,480
Join the hell divers.

87
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,120
Peacekeeping force.

88
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,560
These suits are so sexy.

89
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,680
Yeah!

90
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,740
Oh my god, I love him!

91
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,120
Ah!

92
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,780
And spread managed democracy.

93
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,900
Oh, yeah!

94
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,080
Become a hero.

95
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,940
Become a legend.

96
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,820
Wow, that should be me in that plane.

97
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,100
Become a Helldiver.

98
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,140
A Helldiver.

99
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,140
That's us today.

100
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,000
That's us four.

101
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,200
Sorry that I'm lagging a little bit.

102
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,060
I'm going to fix some settings once it lets me.

103
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,220
Top secret.

104
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:28,900
Age.

105
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,780
Oh my gosh.

106
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,060
That's, wait.

107
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,300
Oh, average age, maybe.

108
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,800
The game is too high quality.

109
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,080
I can't believe we're actually going to become hell divers.

110
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:41,780
Oh my god.

111
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,080
Me neither, girlfriend.

112
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,540
Next recruit prepared to smelt.

113
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,740
Archie, hell's sake.

114
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,340
Liberating the galaxy?

115
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,300
Stomping bugs?

116
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,060
They're bugs.

117
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,340
Every kid's dream.

118
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,940
What kind of psychopath kid are you?

119
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
Good luck out there.

Would you look at that?

Already fixed.

137
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,140
Is there a motion blur or anything like that?

138
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,800
Oh, motion blur?

139
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:27,660
Ooh.

140
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,840
Maybe we can turn it like a little bit on.

141
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,920
Like 50%.

142
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,240
Yeah.

143
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,040
Zero?

144
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Zero motion blur?

145
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,320
You sure?

146
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,820
Is it sure?

147
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,880
Okay, I'll turn it off.

148
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,780
I'll turn it off.

149
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,580
I'll turn it off.

150
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,960
Okay.

We've been, technically we've been friends for almost four
years.

525
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
If you really think about it.

526
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,500
Yeah, that's interesting.

527
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,840

Wow.

531
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,960
I still remember when you first debuted, you were this cute
little ghosty ghost.

532
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,380
Stop.

533
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,300
You're talking about me like that, mom, you're embarrassing
me.

534
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,160
And now she's old.

535
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,200
And now you're old.

536
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,020
I still remember when you debuted this model too, and I was
so emotional.

537
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,540
I was like, oh my god, there's my baby little bit.

538
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,240
Aww.

539
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,960
Let's try it on three instead of seven for difficulty.

540
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,320
Okay, three.

541
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,480
Yeah, and then we'll ramp it up if Mint is comfy.

542
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,440
But basically Mint, you have to fight either the bugs, my
cousins, or you gotta fight the robots.

543
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:22,900
Okay.

544
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:30,880
I say at the start, the bugs are much easier because the
robot shoot back at you oh yeah that's bad uh if you have

545
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:38,480
any questions please like ask ahead right this is one of
those uh do you get the weapons are they are the weapons osp

546
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:46,100

with you or do you get them like there uh you bring them

547
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:56,940

I'm gonna look at my cape.

552
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,160
It's really flowy.

553
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,860
I recommend sticking with a buddy.

554
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,200
I recommend you stick with Hanya.

555
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,320
And I'll be with you guys often.

556
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,440
Oh, hey, man.

557
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,760

559
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,460
Yeah, no, that's not Hanya.

560
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:14,760
Wait.

Oh, God.

563
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,720
Yeah, that's me, Hanya, Daniel.

564
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,040
She's talking with the wrong person.

565
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:22,680
I love it.

566
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,600
She's a big muscular man.

567
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,400
are so big.

568
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,200
Your brain is so large.

569
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,580

570
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,480
Oh, thank you.

571
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,900
Where do I go?

572
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,600
Do I go into a little hell pod?

573
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,260
At the end of the ship, there's like a little pod and you go
into it.

574
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,540
Oh, here.

575
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,060
My very own hell pod.

Yeah.

577
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,760

started.

00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,440
And then you here pick, like, your stuff.

580
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,660
As you gain more levels, you'll be able to have more
stratagems and, you know, you have more of them, pick more

581
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:53,880
of them.

00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,880
Ask their bugs.

00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,800
That's their guys.

639
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:14,620
Ah!

00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,100
You gotta shoot them.

641
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:15,700
It's been a while.

642
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,580
You see that orange thing on the ground?

643
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,640
That means it's a bug breach.

644
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,180
So they're coming up to attack us.

645
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:21,480
Okay.

646
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,200
That red thing is I'm summoning.

647
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,460
Be careful.

648
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,280
Stay away from that.

649
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,580
Oh.

00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,300
Yeah.

00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,240
So you'll see.

653
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,300
You'll get there.

654
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,680
It's a lot of food.

655
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,840
Are we going to the orange thing?

656
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,460
Orange is the main mission.

657
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,060
Usually Haru and I like to like run around and do random
stuff.

658
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,600
How do you go to the orange?

659
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,540
Oh, tab.

660
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,500
Okay, I see it.

661
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,340
I know it's a little stressful at first.

662
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,460
Feel free to ask anything.

663
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,060
That's why.

664
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah.

665
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,360
Okay.

666
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:49,740
Whatever.

667
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:57,000
the jellyfish they're so cute yeah there's different planets
which do different stuff super credit nice yeah i got us

668
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:06,660
some i got you babe thank you got you super credit the red
if you look on the map there's like big red kind of yeah

669
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:15,880
yeah that's usually an enemy nest yeah oh i blew up a
something and exploded on me good i think oh don't worry

670
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:24,480
that's uh normal i mean to like you things nipply nipply
things they look like onion so if you run into them they

671
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:32,100
create like this fog and i think they help with avoiding the
bugs because bugs rely oh they actually help you oh no no no

672
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:39,400
no uh i'm getting that except the robots rely on sight bugs
do not oh yeah but also i think it's like it slows the bugs

673
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:46,500
down a little bit doesn't it i do not know i think i thought
it slowed them down a little tiny bit i forget the big the

674
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:55,740
big orange thing where do you aim at the face or you aim at
his ass no not the charger the the thick orange one that his

675
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:08,840
face oh his face yeah you aim oh is that guy over there do
you see this shoot him shoot him shoot him get him kill him

676
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:16,600
over there shoot him you see this thing do not shoot him
it's a hell bomb oh okay shoot it All right, so if I back it

677
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,920
up, now let the demons win this one now watch what happens

678
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,340

We we we love explosions.

681
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:43,760
We love explosions my samples Samples is like what you take
to upgrade your ship slowly.

682
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,620
You're always gonna need common sense Where do you get the
items?

683
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,580
Where are you finding these?

684
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,580
It's on the ground.

685
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,280
Oh, do not go in there, Henya.

686
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,500
Don't worry, you'll get better at spotting them, my love.

687
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,160
Okay.

688
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,960
Like, trust me, even me, sometimes I have a hard time, like,
running around and figuring out where I'm going.

689
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:03,800
I got you.

690

699
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,960
I saw you through the two grenades over there.

700
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,480

No, no resupply.

She's dead.

708
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,980
So this is what you could do.

709
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,380
So you can reinforcements.

710
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,060

00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:36,980
What do I do?

714
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,280
How do I do?

715
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,680
Control and then you go up down, right, left, up.

716
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,160
Oh, up down.

717
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,600
What a gamer.

718
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,120
I know.

719
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:42,880
That was gaming.

720
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,140
Yeah.

721
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:46,440
Yeah.

722
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,500
And now she'll summon.

723
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:47,860
There you go.

724
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:48,660
Come on.

725
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,040
Come in.

726
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,720
Watch out.

727
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,040
You might die to the helipod.

728
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,040
I'm coming.

729
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,040
I'm coming.

730
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:56,320
Okay.

731
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,180
Meow.

732
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,100
Oh, there you are.

733
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,140
This is meowing.

734
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,100
Blood breach detected.

735
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,980
So, Mitt, you know how you like are low on supplies?

736
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,860
Since I have a supply pack, I can give you a refill.

737
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,420
Oh, okay.

738
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:09,880
Thanks.

739
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,020
Wait, how do you know I'm low on supplies?

740
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,160
Because the little diamond on your chest is glowing.

741
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,560
It does.

742
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:16,800
It does.

743
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,020
Watch out.

744
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,480
Watch out.

745
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:19,820
Watch out.

746
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:19,880
Watch out.

747
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,160
Oh, there's a red one.

748
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,020
I forgot I have the impact grenade.

749
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,100
It's kind of harder to hit.

750
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,700
Oh, I think I'm dead.

751
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,440
Okay.

752
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:31,840
One second.

753
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,260
She's dead.

754
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:32,740
She's dead.

755
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,140
I was killed by myself.

756
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,500
Take my eagle.

757
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:37,920
Oh, wait.

758
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,520
Where did he go?

759
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,780
I had the impact grenade.

760
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,780
Oh, I shouldn't use the machine gun.

761
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,360
You're right.

762
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:43,800
One more.

763
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,760
Oh wait, no.

764
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,540
Get her hand, yeah.

765
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,080
Oh shit, whoa, I'm right there!

766
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,380
I'm right here!

767
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,860
Good job.

768
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,140
Nice!

769
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,280
Alright, so over here, Min.

770
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,780
You'll be a natural in no time, Min.

771
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,720
Don't even sweat it.

772
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,120
This is one of the missions.

773
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,000
So if you open up your map, you see how it's orange?

774
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:05,640
Yeah.

775
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,480
That's one of the main missions.

776
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,000
Oh.

777
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,560
So this one is upload data.

778
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,240
So basically do the stratagem thing.

779
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,720
But you just see how it's glowing.

780
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,820
Oh yeah, yeah, I see it.

781
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,560
Yeah.

782
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,260
And then you just basically just stand here and protect the
area.

783
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:17,800
Oh, okay.

784
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,700
I can do that.

785
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,300
Until it uploads all the corn into that thing.

786
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,180
Yeah, corn.

787
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,420
What?

788
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,240
This is corn.

789
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:27,760
No, no, no, no, no.

790
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:28,880
Corn.

791
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,380
This is the corn, the glowing pieces.

792
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,100
I think corn.

793
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,040
Corn!

794
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,460
Oh, Hanya, what's the word you learned the other day?

795
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,240
Mint, you're gonna...

796
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,600
Canto!

797
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,200
She's serving.

798
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,480
Wait, what?

799
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,700
I'm serving canto!

800
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,820
I tried to tell her not to, but...

801
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,720
Oh, you're serving Kant?

802
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,880
I'm so proud of you, Henya!

803
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:48,580
Yay!

804
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,220
Thank you!

805
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,700
This is my day four, serving Kanto!

806
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,720
My new job?

807
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,240
Kanto!

808
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,620
No, no, no, no, no.

809
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,100
If you really want to emphasize that, you're gonna say Kant
without the too.

810
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,400
Kanto!

811
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,340
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

812
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:04,780
Yeah!

813
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,840
That's what I'm tired of it.

814
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,660
It's really hard on my wife!

815
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,340
You!

816
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,640
My...

817
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,380
My...

818
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,480
Both of my Oshis are always serving.

819
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,640
Wait, who's your other Oshis?

820
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:22,460
Kiwawa.

821
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,280
Oh, Kiwawa!

822
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,000
Oh, it's true!

823
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:25,740
She does!

824
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:26,760
Yeah!

825
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,160
My Zen Biden!

826
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,500
Oh, there's throwing up on us!

827
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,300
Shoot him at the face, mid!

828
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,800
Oh, I'm trying to run away!

829
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,080
Wait, how do I get to my machine gun, you guys?

830
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,440
You have to...

831
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,400
You can see on your map if you maybe dropped it.

832
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,520
Oh, I dropped it?

833
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:50,240
afraid to use um to use uh alt to jump out of attacks if you
notice that like the monsters are coming in or they're

834
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:58,380
shooting you or anything oh also reload is like you you
should not do the reload until your ammo runs out too yeah

835
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:04,860
okay so you know in some games like here if you have a
little bit of ammo and you use it it loses the full ammo oh

836
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:13,020
really i know it feels overwhelming at first baby but don't
worry i'm okay you'll get the hang of it real quick i'm just

837
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,360
shooting I'm running and shooting.

838
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,460
Good, good, good.

839
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,240
Running and gunning.

840
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:16,800
That's my girl.

841
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,740
Running and shooting.

842
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,340
Running and shooting.

843
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,500
Actually, I can summon your shield.

844
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,220
It's going to help you.

845
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:26,640
Over here.

846
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,580
So if you'll wind up your tank, you see this white icon.

847
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,220
Yeah, let's do a...

848
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,260
Haru, do you want to do the blue mission or show them?

849
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:32,540
Oh, yeah.

850
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,200
Let's get the weapon thing.

851
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:34,460
Blue.

852
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,320
Well, once you're done with the mission, the longer the
mission goes, the harder it gets because there's more bugs

853
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:39,800
that spawn.

854
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,140
And at the end, all the bugs on the map come to you.

855
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:42,700
What?

856
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:48,760
if you have extra time you should always try to do side
missions so the blue on the map if you open tab you see a

857
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:54,240
little blue thing that's a side mission okay so we're gonna

Yes, yes, yes.

881
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,780

Wait, what it is.

886
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:08,760
What is?

887
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,600
Pressing again.

888
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:10,560
What it is.

889
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:11,700
Oh!

00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,300
And I hate always getting behind this little guy.

892
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:16,820
There we go.

893
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,680
Oh my god, this is me.

894
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,900
I'm spreading lies on the internet.

895
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,420
Stop spreading.

I'm uploading lies.

897
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,040
This one's a churning the tower, so do you see this thing
rising up?

898
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,780
Yes, I see it.

899
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,580
So usually, this is a two-person mission.

900
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:40,020
do one person because all you have to do is spin this thing
and if you hear the beep on the terminal then that means you

901
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:45,740
have successfully aligned it so henya will turn it and you
can go back to the terminal and you can tell her which

902
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:52,540
direction to turn it oh yeah i'll turn it i'll turn it wait

colored area, that's one.

00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:09,800
Wait, what?

907

You're right there.

There's a guy coming.

913
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,060
I think I'm gonna die here.

914
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,200
I think I'm gonna die here.

915
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,440
I think I'm gonna die here.

916
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,180
I think I'm gonna die here.

917
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:20,540
I am yelling.

918
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:21,660

I am living my best life.

00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:47,760
I'm just like a diamond.

944
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,200
It looks like you're in trouble, my friend.

945
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,100
I'm here to help.

946
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:51,500
Ow!

947
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,040
Ooh, ow!

948
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,780
I am shining like a diamond.

00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,540
I can't see- Oh!

Thank you!

951
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,540
Thank you!

952
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,800
Oh, oh, what's this?

953
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,520
Where's the resupply?

954
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,920
Oh, how do I take this?

955
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,180
Oh, there's a supply over here.

956
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,700
I don't think you can really see it because...

957
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,340
Where's the resupply?

958
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,340
Did I not summon it?

959
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,500
There's diamond over here.

960
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:10,060
Wait.

961
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,460
You guys...

962
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,840
Did I forget to summon the resupply?

963
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,880
Did I screw it up?

964
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,080
Oh, that's a thing.

965
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:15,640
I got the airstrike.

966
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,240
Is it on shoulder?

967
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:19,900
Wow!

968
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,640
You can't move in the fire, Daya!

969
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,060
Here, I can summon it.

970
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,320
Yeah!

971
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:27,860
Okay, yeah, perfect.

972
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,480
Oh, uh, oh, I had forgotten to summon the resupply.

973
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:30,860
My bad.

974
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,640
I got your back.

975
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,260
Oh, I think I'm dead!

976
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:38,160
I got you, I got you!

977
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,080
You're alive, you're alive!

978
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,600
Thank you.

979
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,400
Oh, no!

980
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,920
Wait, no!

981
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:45,700
I already called,

982
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,330
I already called, no worries.

983
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:55,970
I already called, no worries.

984
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:57,710
I got a stim.

985
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,630
I got another resupply.

986
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:03,730
Hold on.

987
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:05,630
Feed mommy.

988
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:06,510
Wait, wait.

989
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:07,830
Okay, give me.

990
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:08,350
Thanks, baby.

991
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:08,930
Did it work?

992
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:09,570
No problem.

993
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:12,590
Thank you, Daya!

994
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:13,190
Okay!

995
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:15,510
You're doing great, Mint.

996
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:16,510
I didn't do that, though.

997
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:17,470
You're doing really good, Mint.

998
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:18,510
I didn't do anything.

999
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:19,970
I didn't even do...

1000
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,390
I mean, at first you just gotta get used to like the
positioning and stuff like that, right?

1001
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,170
I'm gonna go get the stuff that you dropped back here.

1002
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:25,810
Oh!

1003
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:26,850
All the white icons?

1004
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:27,710
Yeah!

1005
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:29,650
Oh, I'll come with...

1006
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,750
Oh yeah, Mint, Mint, Mint!

1007
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:31,350
Yeah.

1008
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,850
Next game, I'm gonna summon a shield for you.

1009
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,030
It's gonna help you a bit with like getting hurt.

1010
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:36,610
Okay!

1011
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:39,010
It'll absorb a few damage and then it respawns.

1012
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,570
It's because she's far now.

1013
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:44,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1014
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:48,210
What the hell is a fire?

1015
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,950
Kill the fire.

1016
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:59,610
One thing is, well, so sometimes when we get into big bug
fights, like when the bug breach happened or anything, we,

1017
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:02,330
usually what we do is like we alternate using our big
abilities.

1018
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:03,090
Oh my god.

1019
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:04,750
Yeah, I'm listening.

1020
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,710
Which is like when you call in from the ship, that really
helps.

1021
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:09,450
I died.

1022
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,010
Who wants to reinforce her?

1023
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,110
I'm busy.

1024
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,290
I got it.

1025
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:15,570
I got it.

1026
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:15,830
I got it.

1027
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:16,590
I got it.

1028
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:17,330
I got it.

1029
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,710
I got it.

1030
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:19,090
I got it.

1031
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,910
I got it.

1032
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:21,730
I got it.

1033
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:22,510
There you go.

1034
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:23,370
I did it.

1035
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:24,210
I did it.

1036
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,550
Are my egos forever?

1037
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,390
Because I feel like I've had so many of them.

1038
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,490
Egos are unlimited compared to lizard.

1039
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:30,290
Oh, I didn't realize.

1040
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:30,930
Oh, wow.

1041
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:31,710
There's a lot of guys.

1042
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:32,550
Oh, yeah.

1043
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:33,610
That's why I always...

1044
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:35,170
I love it.

1045
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,930
I'm so good for the, yeah, for clearing the nest.

1046
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:38,830
Get some.

1047
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:40,230
Looking for the samples while I'm here.

1048
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:41,390
Yeah.

1049
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:43,210
I hate spears.

1050
00:53:46,490 --> 00:54:00,590

1052
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,150
Well, I summon you, Hado, okay?

1053
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:19,170
That's really hot.

1054
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,330
I don't want to summon you.

1055
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:21,050
No?

1056
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:25,130
It's called Mistake, you know?

1057
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:26,670
Mistakes were made.

1058
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:29,470
Is there a good way to see where I dropped my stuff?

1059
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:30,310
Oh, maybe over here.

1060
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,070
If you look at your map, it's going to show you where your
stuff was.

1061
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:35,630
What does it look like?

1062
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:36,630
Maybe that?

1063
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,670
It looks like a gun.

1064
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,130
It looks like the icons of your stratagems.

1065
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:41,090
For example.

1066
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:45,350
It looks like a gun that I love that.

1067
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:46,590
No, I think I helped.

1068
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:48,450
The yellow symbol.

1069
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:49,450
Oh, yeah!

1070
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:50,850
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.

1071
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:57,730
Yeah, you'll, trust me, even I, like, completely lose myself
in this game, and I play it quite a bit.

1072
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:58,510
Play a sample.

1073
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,950
Oh, someone's machine gun.

1074
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,970
Oh my god, the stupid impact grenades!

1075
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:04,870
Is it mine?

1076
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,830
Oh my god, I missed every single shot that I took.

1077
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:10,150
I cannot believe this.

1078
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:11,090
It was mine.

1079
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,370
This is my gun.

1080
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,030
Mata, do you require assistance?

1081
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,470
I have one big battery left!

1082
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:19,510
And I missed it.

1083
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:20,870
Sweet liberty!

1084
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:23,310
Liberty, liberty!

1085
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,510
Come here for a second, actually.

1086
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:25,650
This actually works out.

1087
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:28,050
This here is called a friendship door.

1088
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:28,590
I'm coming.

1089
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,430
I have a minute and a half left before my other stuff pops
up.

1090
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:32,870
It's fine.

1091
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:33,950
I'll just wait.

1092
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:34,910
What's this thing?

1093
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:35,370
Yeah?

1094
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:38,810
Go to that yellow thing, and you and Henya hit it at the
same time.

1095
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:39,210
Oh, no.

1096
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,270
You don't have to count down, but like, Henya can hit it?

1097
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,350
I love you so much.

1098
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:43,970
Oh no, come here!

1099
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:44,450
Over here!

1100
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:44,770
Over here!

1101
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:45,810
Thanks for hanging out.

1102
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:46,210
This way!

1103
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:46,770
This way!

1104
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:48,310
We're teaching men how to play this game.

1105
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:49,490
Here?

1106
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:50,110
Down there!

1107
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,530
Down there!

1108
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:52,750
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

1109
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:53,850
Ready?

1110
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:54,210
Boop!

1111
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,350
Hold on, I can't use them.

1112
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,690
Now you can get the shit in there.

1113
00:55:58,930 --> 00:55:59,110
Oh!

1114
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:00,450
There's a shit!

1115
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,890
Yeah, go ahead, you said!

1116
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:03,790
It's a shit!

1117
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:04,530
It's a shit!

1118
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:06,770
What's in there?

1119
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:07,970
Shit!

1120
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,890
Oh, there's grenades in here!

1121
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,970
Oh, we got breakfast system slips, which is really nice too.

1122
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,350
I have to use my grenades.

1123
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:15,810
You can shoot the cylinders that sparks.

1124
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:17,930
Oh.

1125
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:18,810
Thank you.

1126
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:19,570

00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:20,030
There's.

1128
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:20,570
Oh, no.

1129
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,530
Oh, there's little buddies that are dead here.

1130
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:25,810
33 seconds.

1131
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:26,870
He's just sleeping.

1132
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:27,930
He's fine.

1133
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:28,910
He's fine.

1134
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:29,450
I crashed.

1135
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:30,350
Oh, no.

1136
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:31,130

Okay.

1157
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:28,390
Where are you?

1158
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,330
I'm here.

1159
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:30,450
I'm here in front of you.

1160
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:31,090
Oh, I see.

1161
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:32,330
Yeah, you'll see the little shield.

1162
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:33,370
This?

1163
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:34,350
Yeah.

1164
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:34,850
Wait, wait, wait.

1165
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:35,370
Let it drop.

1166
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:35,770
Let it drop.

1167
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:36,670
Don't stand under it.

1168
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,230
I should have let you stand under it.

1169
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:41,710
I was like, wow, that's a cool looking shield.

1170
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:44,630
Wow.

1171
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:50,330
You'll see like right now I have to like I'm going to you
but it's it's touching the shield instead of you.

1172
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,050
Oh, so you can handle it.

1173
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:53,270
Oh, by the way, this is a bug breach.

1174
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:54,050
Do you see it right there?

1175
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,810
That's a bug breach, baby.

1176
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:57,450
What's a bug breach?

1177
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:00,910
So usually the bugs, it's like little patrols that they
send.

1178
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:04,830
So when you see that, that means we're getting attacked by
like a group of bugs, which is fine.

1179
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:05,870
It happens quite often.

1180
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:06,390
It happens.

1181
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,770
You know, it's just life.

1182
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,970
It's my cousin would be sad for the family.

1183
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,050
I'm gonna go get a shiny for him.

1184
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:13,650
Oh!

1185
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:19,830
Mata, you have to protect Minda and Arpa ha- Oh, actually,
is it...

1186
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,750
Oh my God, I'm gonna die!

1187
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:21,630
I'm gonna die!

1188
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:23,170
Just run, just run.

1189
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:24,650
If you're like outnumbered, just run.

1190
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:25,570
I'm trying to run!

1191
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:27,830
Just keep running, keep running.

1192
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:28,590
You got something?

1193
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:31,130
You have a friendship door that I need to assist with.

1194
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:33,590
Run and then turn back and get out of it.

1195
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:37,570
That's usually the way.

1196
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:40,330
You run and gun into us and then we run and gun and help.

1197
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,070
I have Haru Nya.

1198
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:43,990
door to open.

1199
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:44,950
Oh, shoot.

1200
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:45,930
It is what it is.

1201
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,490
And now I'm here for Harunya!

1202
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:51,490

1203
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:52,630
Ready!

1204
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:56,070
I think Harunya is cute, but I think Hentara is better.

1205
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:57,030
Hentara?

1206
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:58,550
That's my favorite ship, Hentara.

1207
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:01,470
I think that's, I think you're biased.

1208
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:06,330
I said, Masha, I thought you were trying to get my visa.

1209
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:07,810
Yeah, you're trying to get our visa.

1210
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,430
Yeah, my visa, my precious visa, dao.

1211
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,970
You got good shit in there, Hentara.

1212
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:12,790

And I said, now, so he was like, oh, is that the one girl
who played Fortnite?

1248
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,070
And she's fine.

01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:23,910
She's cool.

1250
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,250
Because he loves Fortnite.

1251
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:29,510
Oh, he's not like other dads.

1252
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:30,330
He's a cool dad.

1253
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:30,750

It's fine.

1258
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:35,450
You guys want to go to the attraction zone?

01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:10,770
Yeah.

1276
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,730
It's because he's summoning guys.

1277
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:13,850
Don't worry.

1278
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,070
I'm dying to be busy.

1279
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:18,270
I just think it just went down the wrong tube.

1280
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:19,790
You okay?

1281
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:21,110
I'll activate.

1282
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:21,750
It happens.

1283
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:22,410
It happens.

1284
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:26,010
So I don't want to scare you girls, but we're about to get a
lot of bugs.

1285
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:30,750
They're all about to come to us, which is why you always
should try to finish the missions not super late on high

1286
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,110
difficulties.

1287
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:31,770
Oh my god.

1288
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:33,470
Don't spit on me.

1289
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:34,910
I think we'll be fine at level two.

1290
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:37,650
Oh yeah, we'll be more than fine, but...

1291
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:38,210
Oh, shit.

1292
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,830
I think we should turn it up a bit.

1293
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,350
I'm down for four.

1294
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:43,750
I think that'd be pretty fine.

1295
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:45,990
Let's try four and then we'll see how.

1296
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:47,950
Rilo!

1297
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:49,830
Ouch!

1298
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,410
I wish I had my machine!

1299
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:56,930
Eagle!

1300
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:57,570
Eagle!

1301
01:03:58,090 --> 01:03:59,130
You can summon another one.

1302
01:03:59,630 --> 01:03:59,970
Oh my god.

1303
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:00,210
Oh my god.

1304
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:00,830
You're right.

1305
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:01,250
Oh.

1306
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:03,550
Yeah, they go on cooldowns.

1307
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:04,930
They go on cooldowns.

1308
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:06,010
Summon the one you want.

1309
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:14,450
getting attacked by run towards us if ever you're like in a
situation where you're getting attacked a lot run towards

1310
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:21,210
your your uh allies because they will be able to shoot the
bugs off yeah you're right you're so right yeah and

1311
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:27,930
sometimes a grenade is faster than other stuff like
summoning i keep forgetting to throw my grenades okay that's

1312
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:36,750
okay you'll trust me it's it's pretty overwhelming the first
time okay you're doing really good oh by the way don't worry

1313
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:42,490
about the like how much time you'd love to use a stratagem
because then the airship will go out.

1314
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:45,390
I'll be honest, I didn't even see a timer.

1315
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:49,750
Now I feel stressed.

1316
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:50,470
No, I'm just kidding.

1317
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,050
No, no, no, you're fine.

1318
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,930
Now I feel stressed and anxiety is quietly down every
second.

1319
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:57,770
I could have lived without that knowledge.

1320
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:58,750
That information?

1321
01:04:59,590 --> 01:04:59,810
Yeah.

1322
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:03,630
I can't believe you would be this insensitive to my
feelings.

1323
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,310
Sorry, it's just the Canadian in me.

1324
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:07,910
Sorry.

1325
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:09,370
Sorry.

1326
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:09,690
Sorry.

1327
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:12,830
It's just the Canadian that's coming out.

1328
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:15,590
Is it too late now to say sorry?

1329
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:18,010
Because I...

1330
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,770
It's funny because that guy is more than just your body.

1331
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:26,650
I'm missing your...

1332
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:28,070
Clear landing zone.

1333
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:29,830
They're very delicious.

1334
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:31,330
I think we cleared it.

1335
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:32,030
What the?

1336
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:32,370
Yeah.

1337
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:35,950
Yeah, I was gonna say, I think level three might be a little
too easy.

1338
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,630
Yeah, you were like, get ready for a bunch of bugs and it
was...

Yahoo!

1347
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:31,030
I am impressed because when my first time didn't kill me

1348
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,330

Being nice to first time player!

1351
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:37,850
The night is young, Hena.

1352
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:39,970
I'm full of dangers.

1353
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:41,170
Uh-oh.

1354
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:42,410
We got three stars.

1355
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:43,170
We did everything.

1356
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:43,670
Ooh!

1357
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:44,710
Nice!

1358
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:46,410
Yippee!

1359
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:47,970
That's true, Mint.

1360
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:49,030
You did kill me.

1361
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:50,410
And yeah, Mint killed me.

1362
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:51,470
Remember that.

1363
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:51,830
I did?

1364
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:53,290
That's fucked up, Dale.

1365
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:53,850
How did I kill you?

1366
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:55,370
Remember when you shot the barrel and I died?

1367
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:57,810
Oh, that was me?

1368
01:06:58,670 --> 01:06:59,050

01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:00,250
Ha ha ha, yeah.

1370
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:04,550
You shot the barrel, Mint.

1371
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:05,490
You told me to.

1372
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,570
I was just being a good listener.

1373
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:11,150
That Hell Divers is so much easier when we're not playing
with Zintra.

1374
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:20,290
because she kills us all the time mint i remember saying

Uh-huh.

1387
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:19,850
So you press R and it shows you the different like battle
passes, but they're permanent.

1388
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:20,930
So you can always get them.

1389
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:21,790
Oh, nice.

1390
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:26,030
So this is where you get your guns and ammo and stuff like
that.

1391
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:28,050
So that's where we get most of our gear and stuff.

1392
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:28,930
Like this one.

1393
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:30,450
Yeah.

1394
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:35,190
And you'll be able, as you keep playing with us, like
you'll, that's why I was doing all the side missions while

1395
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:36,190
you guys were running around.

1396
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:37,990
So that way we have more money to spend.

1397
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:38,830
Mine.

1398
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:40,290
Nice.

1399
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:40,970
Mine.

1400
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:41,610
Money.

1401
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:42,270
Money.

1402
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:43,570
Money.

1403
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:44,050
Money.

1404
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:44,950
Money.

1405
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:47,130
Money.

1406
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:52,220
A rich man's world.

1407
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:55,960
Nah, I like my impact grenades.

1408
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:56,860
I don't want to switch them off.

1409
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,180
Yeah, I like them a lot too.

1410
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,380
And then every mission that we're doing is different.

1411
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,400
So this one is a 15 minute mission.

1412
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:04,580
Oh, it says clicking.

1413
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,700
Usually when people get into that screen, people like to be
like, let's drop here.

1414
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,000
And then they just spam everything.

1415
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:10,340
It's just to be annoying.

1416
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,140
I don't even know.

1417
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,820
I've been doing that for instance at the beginning.

1418
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,900
I infected all my friends with it.

1419
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,420
She's been a little annoying since the beginning.

1420
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,120
That's her haru.

1421
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:18,680
Yeah.

1422
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,320
Big kiss.

1423
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:22,760
Big kiss.

1424
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,580
We can try robots after two minutes.

1425
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:26,080
They are.

1426
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:26,960
They are some.

1427
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:27,880
The robots.

1428
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:28,920
The robots.

1429
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,120
Robot time.

1430
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:30,740
Oh no.

1431
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:31,500
It's a robot.

1432
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:32,100
Uh oh.

1433
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,260
Are we killing?

1434
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:36,160
It looks like.

1435
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:37,580
I'm ready to kill.

1436
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,180
I've never done this mission before, I think.

1437
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,820
How do you see what the mission is?

1438
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:42,620
Rescue.

1439
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:44,140
Oh, yeah.

1440
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:45,840
Press Q, and then you'll see.

1441
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:46,980
Retrieve essential personnel.

1442
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:52,200
Determinate advance has swarmed across this region, leaving
one of our top secret research stations surrounded by the

1443
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:52,440
enemy.

1444
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:57,680
Use your clearance to unlock the emergency bunker doors and
defend the facility staff as they enter to the evacuation

1445
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,100
shuttle.

1446
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,840
Oh, is this the one where you print scientists?

1447
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:02,980
We create people?

1448
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:03,940
Yeah.

1449
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:07,880
You basically, like, you click a button and then the people
come out, so you just kind of print them.

1450
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,140
It's great.

1451
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,140
Oh.

1452
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,820
This is the clone wars after all my love.

1453
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,840
Here we go.

1454
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,680
Wait, it's a little five.

1455
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:20,300
Oh, sure.

1456
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,520
Am I a clone?

1457
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:23,140
Yeah!

1458
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,620
You're a clone of yourself!

1459
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:29,880
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1460
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,980
Blah, blah, blah.

1461
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,600
Blah, blah, blah.

1462
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,840
Blah, blah, blah.

1463
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:37,620
Blah, blah.

1464
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,260
Blah, blah.

1465
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:50,110
How do I use stims on people?

1466
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:53,710
So you go to them and it says use stim.

1467
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:54,830
Oh wow, that's handy.

1468
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:55,990
But only when they're low health.

1469
01:11:56,550 --> 01:12:03,770
Oh yeah, speaking of stims, even if you have like, even like
if you tripped on a rock and have like the minimal like...

1470
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:04,550
Why am I slowed?

1471
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:10,230
Like for example, if you trip and have like a little damage
done to you, I always recommend stimming.

1472
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:12,690
It's always important to have...

1473
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:15,270
I'm always out here stimming, Haruka.

1474
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:17,590
I'm fine.

1475
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:18,210
I'm fine.

1476
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:21,170
But it's always good to use your...

1477
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:29,930
your stim because it gives you once you stim you have like a
few seconds of immunity as well so I always stim even though

1478
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:41,990
if I tripped on a rock and I'm like I have a boo-boo I just
stim that shit that's breach boo-boo fire in the hole I

1479
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:52,710
didn't know you were an overwatch gamer I hate it here I
know she was junk rat honestly mint and junk rat do have a

1480
01:12:52,750 --> 01:13:01,450

overwatch that says fire in the hall wait and that's just

1481
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:17,230

overwatch 2 just completely what really pissed me off was

1484
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:43,870
overwatch 2 entire premise of his existence was to do pve
story base then they canceled that and then all they did is

1485
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:50,770
it's basically the same game but like we're gonna remove one
slot so instead of six it's five people to play like the

Yeah.

You can watch?

1498
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:42,150
You can watch the TV shows without knowing anything about
Overwatch.

1499
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:43,290
Oh yeah, that is true.

1500
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:43,850
That's true.

1501
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:46,550
Fallout, Fallout, Fallout.

1502
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:48,970
Oh!

1503
01:14:53,630 --> 01:15:04,230
fallout fallout fallout fallout lots of fallout in a
radioactive world but yeah that's why i don't like overwatch

1504
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:14,090
mod and i'm so sorry if you like it that's just my opinion

1505
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:19,390
everything you said is valid you press g thank you I don't
think it works.

1506
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:22,170
Oh, check your grenades at the bottom left.

1507
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:23,910
Do you have zero out of four grenades?

1508
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:25,810
Did you use all your grenades?

1509
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:26,730
No, I have three.

1510
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:29,010
Oh my goodness, there's a lot going on here.

1511
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:31,830
Oh, wait, guys, I forgot this is only a 15-minute mission.

1512
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:32,990
Oopsies, I'll come to you.

1513
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:36,010
Oh, I was out here running around, but it's a 15-minute
mission.

1514
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:38,510
Oh, wait, what are we supposed to be doing?

1515
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:39,930
We have to go to the orange thing.

1516
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:40,930
We have to go to the orange thing.

1517
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:42,190
Orange thing.

1518
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:43,330
I completely forgot.

1519
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:44,250
I'll meet you guys there.

1520
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:44,910
Are you okay?

1521
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:47,030
Orange.

1522
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,250
I got you, I got you.

1523
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:50,930
Grenade!

1524
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:51,910
Grenade!

1525
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:53,310
Grenade!

1526
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:55,430
I keep throwing in like terrible.

1527
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:57,730
I thought you could aim it, so I was like, oh.

1528
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:59,270
Yeah, I'm sort of.

1529
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:01,690
You'll get the hang of it.

1530
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:04,770
And then some grenades explode in a little bit.

1531
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:06,830
Nice!

1532
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:08,010
Ow!

1533
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:08,950
Ow!

1534
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:09,630
Ow!

1535
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:10,610
Ow!

1536
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:11,170
My body.

1537
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:11,690
Oh!

1538
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:13,610
What just happened?

1539
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:15,110
What just happened?

1540
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:15,970
I think so...

1541
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,310
Okay, so we have to score 30 type people.

1542
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:19,570
I don't know what... I think the game lagged to me.

1543
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:20,770
It said I was killed by Hena.

1544
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:22,250
Oh.

1545
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:23,390
Wait, what?

1546
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:24,750
I killed...

1547
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:25,030
No, way.

1548
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:26,430
I think the game lagged.

1549
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:28,010
There's no way that Hena would kill me.

1550
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:29,910
I think the game is bugged.

1551
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:30,930
The game is bugged.

1552
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:31,690
Don't worry.

1553
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:35,230
I think that's called copium.

1554
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:37,730
It's been, um...

1555
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:39,210
No, it's been killed by your urchin.

1556
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:40,430
It's kind of precious, though.

1557
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:42,370
People would pay a lot of money for that.

1558
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:43,430
Exactly what I've always wanted.

1559
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:44,910
Yeah, there we go.

1560
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:46,650
Yeah, not gonna lie.

1561
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:48,890
seen this mission before.

1562
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:49,810
Where's my guy?

1563
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:54,590
So over there, Mata, there will be like, I will teach you
the ways, though.

1564
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:56,090
Yeah, I've never seen this mission before.

1565
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:58,390
I think we just skipped past a seven pretty quickly.

1566
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:00,070
So over here.

1567
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:01,110
Oh, at the bottom, right?

1568
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:01,570
The computer?

1569
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:03,370
Yeah, there's this little fun.

1570
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:05,210
You press it and three people come out.

1571
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:06,390
And then you got to protect them.

1572
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:07,310
It's the printing button.

1573
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:07,750
Yeah, yeah.

1574
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:08,670
I'll just start pressing.

1575
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:09,990
He's like this way.

1576
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:10,850
I'm printing.

1577
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,970
Do not shoot the little people walking, by the way, you
guys.

1578
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,130
Don't shoot the little people.

1579
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:16,390
Don't shoot the little people.

1580
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:18,530
Okay, I'm gonna shoot them.

1581
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:19,270
I'm gonna shoot them.

1582
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:19,970
I'm gonna shoot them out.

1583
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:21,250
Kill them out.

1584
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,970
Kill them out.

1585
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:24,790
Demog and sweet liberty.

1586
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:26,810
I think that's communism.

1587
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:30,530
That's not very democratic of you.

1588
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:33,850
Oh, Haru?

1589
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:34,650
Yes.

1590
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:35,590
Are you?

1591
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:36,130
Where are you?

1592
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:37,950
Because one of us needs to be on the end.

1593
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:38,690
You're where?

1594
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:40,450
I'm on the other computer.

1595
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:43,030
Oh, because there's the bug.

1596
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:44,310
The bugs are coming from here.

1597
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:44,990
What's this?

1598
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:45,990
Okay, girls, girls.

1599
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:46,730
Come here, both of you.

1600
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:48,210
You guys are gonna partner in here.

1601
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:48,950
Girls, girls, girls.

1602
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:51,530
Yeah, I'm- you're gonna press this button every time it's
available.

1603
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:52,630
One of you presses the button.

1604
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:54,990
One of you defends like near it.

1605
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,730
And I'm gonna go defend at the other side of the- Oh my God,
little people!

1606
01:17:58,750 --> 01:17:59,410
Where's the button?

1607
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:01,630
Kita, Kita, Kita.

1608
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:04,270
Oh, this button, this button.

1609
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:05,370
Yep, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1610
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:05,970
A key.

1611
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:07,550
How do you know when it's available?

1612
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:08,290
Lights up.

1613
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:09,570
It'll- It'll blow.

1614
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:11,850
Look at him running around.

1615
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:12,710
We're in the box.

1616
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:13,730
We can blow.

1617
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:14,870
Oh my God, these people are gonna die.

1618
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:16,230
These stupid little people.

1619
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:19,550
You don't know how to play with a bug.

1620
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:22,250
They're dumb little clones.

1621
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:22,770
Fuck you.

1622
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:24,890
Just anytime you have the button, just press it.

1623
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:27,030
Anytime you can.

1624
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:28,770
I'm going to punch the shit out of this guy.

1625
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:29,550
It's a Rani.

1626
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:31,350
Push the button.

1627
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:33,630
I can buy eight people.

1628
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:34,370
My children.

1629
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:35,270
My children.

1630
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:36,850
Yeah, you're a mother now.

1631
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:37,270
Congrats.

1632
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:37,790
Oh.

1633
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:40,950
I'm not ready for this response, but it only created three.

1634
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:42,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1635
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,270
It's going to keep creating three.

1636
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:43,970
So just keep.

1637
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:44,490
Okay.

1638
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:47,090
And Hado and I are going to depend on each side.

1639
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:50,390
You guys can shit out six people at a time.

1640
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:50,590
Yeah.

1641
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:52,430
Wait, there's another computer?

1642
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:53,070
Six people!

1643
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:54,010
Well, no, no.

1644
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:55,050
You stay at the one you're at.

1645
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:55,450
Okay.

1646
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,350
You keep doing the one you're at.

1647
01:18:58,350 --> 01:18:59,430
Oh, I see the other one.

1648
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:00,370
Wait, should I go to it?

1649
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:02,010
No, I got it.

1650
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:02,270
No, I don't.

1651
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:03,930
I keep pressing it when you can.

1652
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:05,270
I'm doing the other one.

1653
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:08,690
La la la la.

1654
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:09,710
More people.

1655
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,150
Come out, little scientist.

1656
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:12,050
It's the hell divers!

1657
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:13,650
Why do you run like that?

1658
01:19:13,730 --> 01:19:14,310
Come on.

1659
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:16,590
Come on.

1660
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:17,010
Get him.

1661
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:17,410
Shape!

1662
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:18,310
Get in shape!

1663
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:22,010
How many people do we need?

1664
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:23,050
A lot.

1665
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:24,670
18 out of 35.

1666
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:26,850
Sorry, this mission is the worst.

1667
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:27,830
Okay, okay.

1668
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:28,390
That's alright.

1669
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:28,870
We got this.

1670
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:29,350
We got this.

1671
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:30,530
Come on, citizen.

1672
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:32,030
I'm gonna get a diet freedom.

1673
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:33,030
Anyone else wanna drink?

1674
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:35,970
I would love a little sip of freedom.

1675
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:36,470
Yeah.

1676
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:39,130
Do you have the Dr. Pepper?

1677
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:43,130
That's a very freedom.

1678
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:44,270
Democratic drink.

1679
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:46,050
No, it's just diet freedom.

1680
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,290
Can I get a nukakola?

1681
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:53,310
Oh, real hell divers!

1682
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:56,910
Go, get, stop ogling.

1683
01:19:57,890 --> 01:19:59,450
Oh, my mana's stuck!

1684
01:19:59,710 --> 01:19:59,990
Never mind.

1685
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:03,950
My favorite thing is that they go on top of the rock just to
get to where they are.

1686
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:09,330
I didn't like the taste of freedom!

1687
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:10,390
Freedom!

1688
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:13,430
I hope you guys are...

1689
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:14,010
Oh, it's not lit.

1690
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:15,110
We're almost...

1691
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,830
Keep printing, keep touching, keep doing.

1692
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:18,010
I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

1693
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:19,490
Okay, almost there, almost there, almost there.

1694
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:21,170
Patience.

1695
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:23,010
20, 30, I have 35.

1696
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:24,710
It's a virtue I do not have.

1697
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:26,790
We know.

1698
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:29,610
This is, oh my machine gun.

1699
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:35,470
Oh wow, that's a lot of things over there.

1700
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:37,150
Oh my God, I'm right in front of the door, shit.

1701
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:38,190
Oh shit.

1702
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:39,250
Run!

1703
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:41,810
It's okay, run, run, run, little man, just run through.

1704
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,430
Run, little man, run!

1705
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:46,490
I'm printing more men.

1706
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:48,930
Printing more men, come on.

1707
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:50,010
The mother of men.

1708
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:51,590
Printing men, printing men.

1709
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:53,510
Run my clones.

1710
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:54,270
The mother of men.

1711
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,370
Sons of the Patriots, genome soldiers.

1712
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:57,790
Three more people coming now.

1713
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,450
Run my little genome soldiers.

1714
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:05,190
Oh my god, is that Metal Gear reference?

1715
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:06,230
Oh my god.

1716
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:09,310
Can't believe you just made a Metal Gear reference.

1717
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:11,610
That's crazy.

1718
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:13,510
I feel like I'm not doing enough.

1719
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:15,290
Yeah, you're doing great.

1720
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:16,750
You're doing the most important job of all.

1721
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:18,210
Now we get the fuck out of here.

1722
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:19,310
You're printing the little men.

1723
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:20,730
Yay, we did it!

1724
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:21,550
Oh, that's a big guy.

1725
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:22,610
It's right in the middle.

1726
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:25,690
Wait, have you done the...

1727
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:25,990
Oh, God.

1728
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,230
You can start this up over here, Mint.

1729
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:28,410
Which one?

1730
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:28,930
Where am I?

1731
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:29,930
Yeah, sorry, this is over here.

1732
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:30,650
Very annoying.

1733
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:31,910
I regret picking it.

1734
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:32,310
This thing?

1735
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:35,490
No, do you see my little white arrow thingy?

1736
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:35,750
Yeah, yeah.

1737
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:36,270
Come to it.

1738
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:37,110
Okay, I'm coming.

1739
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:39,210
It's time for you to input the Konami code.

1740
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,190
Oh, here.

1741
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:43,270
Interact.

1742
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:45,070
You got this.

1743
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:46,830
Got it.

1744
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:46,990
Got it.

1745
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:49,890
You're basically a soldier now, congrats.

1746
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:51,010
Oh my god!

1747
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:56,250
You have now evolved to a super citizen.

1748
01:21:56,690 --> 01:21:56,830
Oh!

1749
01:21:57,730 --> 01:21:58,910
Super citizen of...

1750
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:01,630
Dwight, does that mean I have to pay super taxes or...

1751
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:02,530
Yeah, you do.

1752
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:06,810
Unfortunately, I cannot disclose this information, but good
luck.

1753
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:08,670
Whoa, these are so awesome.

1754
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:09,650
These, like, turrets.

1755
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,170
Yeah, it's my turret.

1756
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:13,830
Be careful, though.

1757
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,570
It can still kill you, even though it's her turret.

1758
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:16,070
Oh, just kidding.

1759
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:18,010
Yep, be careful.

1760
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:21,630
Also, I'm sorry, girls, I can't mute.

1761
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:22,570
Thank you for the gifted.

1762
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:24,390
Yay!

1763
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:25,070
Yay!

1764
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:27,830
What's an anti-tank?

1765
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:29,430
I really appreciate it.

1766
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:30,190
Oh, wow.

1767
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:31,610
It's a turd that hates tanks.

1768
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:32,070
I'm joking.

1769
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:32,970
Yeah, it hates it.

1770
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:35,850
I think I just acquired it.

1771
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:38,870
Don't shoot us with it.

1772
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:39,470
Are you sure?

1773
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:39,990
What does that do?

1774
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:40,910
I think you should shoot us with it.

1775
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:41,430
Are you sure?

1776
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:43,030
That'd be really funny.

1777
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:43,830
Do it!

1778
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:44,930
Do it!

1779
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:46,670
I'm sure.

1780
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:47,230
Oh!

1781
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:49,090
I had a shield!

1782
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:51,790
You suck it!

1783
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:55,390
No!

1784
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:56,450
I had a shield, Mint!

1785
01:22:56,590 --> 01:22:57,310
I had a shield!

1786
01:22:58,450 --> 01:22:59,170
My... my...

1787
01:22:59,170 --> 01:22:59,910
I'm gonna... You know what?

1788
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:01,650
I'm gonna drop my hell pod right on your head.

1789
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:02,290
Where are you?

1790
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:03,030
Do it.

1791
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:03,770
I'm right here.

1792
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:05,610
I dropped on my dead body, actually.

1793
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:09,430
You can grab the shield if you want, Mint.

1794
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:09,810
Here.

1795
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:10,370
No, no, no, it's okay.

1796
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:10,750
It's okay.

1797
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:12,990
It's gonna protect you from a... I should have given it to
you sooner.

1798
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:13,350
My bad.

1799
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:13,590
I forgot.

1800
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:14,470
Don't worry about it.

1801
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:16,130
I'll worry about it.

1802
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:18,790
Get it twisted.

1803
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:19,430
I worry.

1804
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:21,190
Okay, these chargers, you see them?

1805
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,710
The big guy with like the big pouch on his butt.

1806
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:25,790
You gotta pop the little pouch on his butt.

1807
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:27,690
He charges on you.

1808
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:28,930
I don't see what you're talking about.

1809
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:31,190
He's at the bottom there.

1810
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,850
Hanya's attacking him.

1811
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:35,030
I'm attacking something.

1812
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:38,010
It's a bug with a big, big, big, big butt.

1813
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:40,330
Got a big fat butt.

1814
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:42,870
Gotta hit his butt.

1815
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:45,170
I gotta hit his butt.

1816
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:48,090
I'm just shooting.

1817
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:48,310
The butt!

1818
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:49,490
Oh, this guy!

1819
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:50,690
Yeah, you see?

1820
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:51,490
He's got a big butt.

1821
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:52,110
Oh, reload.

1822
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:56,830
Once you blow up the little ball on his butt, he dies like
three seconds after.

1823
01:23:57,850 --> 01:23:58,130
Weak.

1824
01:23:58,830 --> 01:23:59,170
Weak.

1825
01:23:59,490 --> 01:23:59,970
Yeah, he's weak.

1826
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:04,910
Why would you die once you're- Oh, someone shot me and
launched me into the fray?

1827
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:05,470
That's cool.

1828
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:06,210
Wait, what?

1829
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:08,330
It wasn't me for real.

1830
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:08,570
Be careful!

1831
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:10,790
Be careful that you might die.

1832
01:24:10,970 --> 01:24:11,250
You might die.

1833
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:11,610
Yeah!

1834
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:13,390
Um, I'm okay.

1835
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:16,550
I don't- Okay, guys, the ship is here if you want to go in.

1836
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:18,230
How do I, uh, there we go.

1837
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:20,610
Uh, I'm trying to get up.

1838
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:22,530
My murder is girls.

1839
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:24,930
It's time.

1840
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:26,910
I can't believe I lived.

1841
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:28,410
How did I survive that?

1842
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:29,630
I don't know.

1843
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:30,210
No.

1844
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:31,070
Oh, whoops.

1845
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:31,650
Oh, he's sorry.

1846
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:32,110
Oh, there.

1847
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:33,750
Oh, God.

1848
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:34,750
I somehow got it.

1849
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:36,190
Dun, dun, dun.

1850
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:37,010
How did I live?

1851
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:39,650
You're just too good at the game.

1852
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:41,750
You're just, you're just a cracked game.

1853
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:48,870
Like, so I, I got blown up by the bug and I flew to the bugs
and then I, there were There was rain of spiders and

1854
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:49,290
everything.

1855
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:50,310
It's crazy.

1856
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:53,670
You fell into the ring of spiders?

1857
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:55,010
We survived.

1858
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:56,610
Survived, I am.

1859
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:00,310
How you liking it so far?

1860
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:01,510
It's so fun.

1861
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:07,930
We, at one point, Haruka and I played this until like 8 in
the morning.

1862
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:11,970
Because what happens is somebody will drop out and then
another person will come in.

1863
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:15,890
And you just, the lobby changes every time and we just play
until 8 in the morning.

1864
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:18,430
That's us.

1865
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,470
That's the title of my ship.

1866
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:23,130
It's the patriotism of patriotism.

1867
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:25,090
I like that.

1868
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:27,010
I think I'm the mother of battle.

1869
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:28,790
The mother of battle.

1870
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,530
My ship is called the Dawn of Eternity.

1871
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:33,090
That's cute.

1872
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:35,910
You are supposed to be badass!

1873
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:37,690
That's cute.

1874
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:39,950
I swear to God, Mint.

1875
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:41,790
Cute.

My brain is twisted.

Oh no.

1886
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:33,650
Mint, every time I look at you, it makes me want to have
mint chocolate and I hate mint chocolate and this is all

1887
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:34,110
your fault.

1888
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:38,790
That, see, that's where it's like a brainwashing.

1889
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:41,630
Are you trying to brainwash me to like something that I
hate?

1890
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:42,190
Yeah.

1891
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:43,950
Wait, you hate it?

1892
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:45,370
Yeah, I don't like mint chocolate.

1893
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:46,550
Bad taste.

1894
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:46,870
Okay.

1895
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:47,810
I never liked it.

1896
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:48,470
What the fuck?

1897
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:49,790
I never liked the chocolate mint.

1898
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:51,950
Never ever ever.

1899
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:55,050
I don't know, just the taste, it just feels too strong in my
mouth.

1900
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:55,550
I'm like, ah.

1901
01:26:56,310 --> 01:27:02,750
I think when I was a kid, I liked it, but as I grow up, I
just like enjoyed different taste, but I don't hate it, I

1902
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:02,990
guess.

1903
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:04,430
That's my girl.

1904
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:05,610

I mean, I like peppermint, but I don't, maybe, you know

1907
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:10,550
Maybe I should try mint chocolate now.

Yeah.

1909
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:12,550

1922
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:37,730
What if I just made a entire documentary of me trying out
mint chocolate just for you?

1923
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:40,310
You're like, hi guys, I'm here to go.

01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:45,970
We're gonna get you, I'm gonna send you a bunch of mint
chocolates and then you can just try them all and you can

1925
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:46,190
decide.

1926
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:47,930
Grab the backpack.

1927
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:48,690
That's a really good idea.

1928
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:50,930
I'm actually so down to this.

1929
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:52,150
I'll leave the backpack for you.

1930
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:53,030
Where?

1931
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:54,890
Give me all your favorite bin chocolates.

1932
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:56,970
And that'd be a fun collab to do actually.

1933
01:28:57,210 --> 01:28:57,810
Holy shit.

1934
01:28:58,190 --> 01:28:59,450
Actually, I'm so down to it.

1935
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:00,950
Oh, wait.

1936
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:04,410
Did they have a matcha flavor in the ice cream?

1937
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:05,950
Or is that only Japan thing?

1938
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:07,430
We do a little bit.

1939
01:29:07,450 --> 01:29:09,330
A little bit, but it's not as popular here.

1940
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:09,950
Mm-hmm.

1941
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:12,090
It's way more popular in Japan.

1942
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:12,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1943
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:14,390
And the matcha in Japan is so good.

1944
01:29:15,370 --> 01:29:16,690
I never left my house.

1945
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:26,030
what that's like well you you and henya are a little two
hiki commodities yeah we never go outside no it's just

1946
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:35,410
ironic considering my background yeah outside is overrated
outside is scary don't go outside oh i think no outside i

1947
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:41,650
don't remember yeah welcome to the welcome to the team

1948
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:49,130
have to load the little sea missiles.

1949
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:50,790
All right, let's do this.

1950
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:54,870
Let's not throw a grenade for this one, because we'll get
more points if we don't actually do it.

1951
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:56,450
What do you mean more points?

1952
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:58,450
We get more points for us.

1953
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:00,110
Oh, that's a big, oh, that's his butt.

1954
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:00,950
That's his butt.

1955
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:02,790
Wait, how do I get your butt?

1956
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:04,770
Get your butt, get your butt.

1957
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:06,750
That was where the thingy went in.

1958
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:09,470
Oh, no, I want to see your butt.

1959
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:10,550
No.

1960
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:12,930
Give me your butt.

1961
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:13,650
Give me your butt.

1962
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:14,770
There it is.

1963
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:15,010
Oh.

1964
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:16,150
She's staying.

1965
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,170
Oh my god.

1966
01:30:18,430 --> 01:30:19,010
Oh my god.

1967
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:20,390
Ah!

1968
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:21,510
Ah!

1969
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:23,390
I

1970
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:29,020
got killed by Henya.

1971
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,400
I think the game glitched again.

1972
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,700
I said I got killed by Henya again.

1973
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,280
Mata, can you revive all of us?

1974
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,560
Because Henya killed us all?

1975
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,560
Yeah, everybody!

1976
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:41,220
I'm sorry.

1977
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:41,780
Alright, girls.

1978
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:42,880
Make yourselves useful.

1979
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:47,020
Grab an artillery missile and load him in.

1980
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:49,620
You can't tell me what to do.

1981
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:50,760
Load him in.

1982
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:51,980
Stuff.

1983
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:52,740
What's this?

1984
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:53,440
Go get your stuff.

1985
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:53,920
Go get your stuff.

1986
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:55,180
Wait, where's my stuff?

1987
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,080
You can see it on the map.

1988
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:57,560
Oh yeah, yeah.

1989
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:58,820
It's just that I was the only one alive.

1990
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:00,680
So I'm the only one that can summon you guys back.

1991
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:01,240
Yeah.

1992
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:03,400
I'm gonna go get my stuff.

1993
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,600
Yeah, you can go get your stuff.

1994
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,040
No, I'm- You can see it on the map.

1995
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:07,920
You can follow them.

1996
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,080
These dogs are pissing me off.

1997
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:11,260
You sons of bitches.

1998
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:13,020
These bugs were made for walking.

1999
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:16,700
Ah, this is what they- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2000
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:17,960
Ah, this is what I do.

2001
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,040
The drop method.

2002
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:19,760
Is this how you- What is this?

2003
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:22,620
Walk on.

2004
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:24,300
How is that actually faster?

2005
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:25,180
What the heck?

2006
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:26,220
Where is my stuff?

2007
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,660
Did I pass it or?

2008
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:29,800
Where is my stuff?

2009
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:30,620
Is that my stuff?

2010
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:31,060
Oh, it's this way.

2011
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:31,800
Is that my stuff?

2012
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:33,140
This is kind of...

2013
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:35,260
This is like...

2014
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:36,940
This is speedrunner strat.

2015
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,140
She's speedrunning?

2016
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:43,480
It's because I didn't know how to speedrun a mission, but
that's because I never do the missions.

2017
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,660
I always bring Haruka who always does the missions.

2018
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:46,860
Yeah!

2019
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:48,600
Oh!

2020
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:49,680
Oh!

2021
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:50,800
Oh!

2022
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,240
Oh!

2023
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,000
Are you okay?

2024
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:54,080
You're okay.

2025
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,600
Yeah, I broke my screen.

2026
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:56,300
You're okay.

2027
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:56,600
You're okay.

2028
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:58,540
Watch this, man.

2029
01:31:58,800 --> 01:31:59,280
Watch this.

2030
01:31:59,360 --> 01:31:59,640
Uh-huh.

2031
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:01,660
Dead.

2032
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:02,600
Whoa.

2033
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,700
Is this the butt guy or am I crazy?

2034
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:06,700
Yeah, that's the butt guy.

2035
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:07,660
Okay.

2036
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:08,860
But if you have...

2037
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:09,740
Charger, charger.

2038
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:15,900
So your weapon, if you shoot at it, do you see these sparks
coming out of it?

2039
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:16,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2040
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,800
That means your IMO is not penetrating.

2041
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:19,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2042
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,360
I noticed that.

2043
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,860
So you have to hit his ass.

2044
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,280
But for me, who has the, what I like to call the croissant
cannon, I buy a shoot at the right angle.

2045
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,340
I can one shot of it and kill him instantly.

2046
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:37,400
I call the croissant cannon, but I call it the croissant
cannon, and it's...

2047
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,460
Oh, my stuff is over here.

2048
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,900
Oh, my stuff is over there.

2049
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:41,600
You know what?

2050
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,720
Let's just leave it alone.

2051
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,380
No, go get your stuff.

2052
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:45,320
Go get your shield pack.

2053
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,680
There's a lot of guys over there.

2054
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:48,460
They'll help you.

2055
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:49,240
You guys are fun.

2056
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:50,220
Oh, look guys.

2057
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:50,960
They're dead.

2058
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:58,480
they're dead all the guys are dead it's a woman's only game
no men here oh exactly i actually don't even know where my

2059
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:10,280
stuff is right here oh right here you're right yeah that one

2060
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:17,880
coming back i'm coming back before though that's kind of
crazy how that works so henya's eagle also broke the illegal

2061
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:26,900
turn the the transmitter tower but if you actually do it
legitimately you get more points so I was going to see that

2062
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:34,140
was the case oh so Hania did it illegitimately yeah but it's
okay I didn't realize I was so far on the map wait did I

2063
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:45,680
fuck up no no we just get less points but that's it oh how
nice I got rid of the nest good job girlies the bug nest by

2064
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:50,840
the way like you'll see them in the future you gotta throw
little grenades in them oh yes I remember them from the

2065
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:56,440
tutorial different so i don't know what they look like in
the real world yeah because i keep killing them in the real

2066
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:03,380
world in the real i only know the in the mission the
tutorial they haven't trained me for the real world i'll

2067
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:09,400
stop um i'll stop giving help from now on if you have
questions feel free to ask it's just that at first when i

2068
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:15,400
first played nobody explained anything to me and i had a
really hard time streaming and following along no you're

2069
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:19,240
good did i do a bad job explaining to My first games wasn't
with you, baby.

2070
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:20,840
Oh, right, right, right.

2071
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,860
And again, it's absolutely not, you know, a criticism.

2072
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:26,560
I played with some lovely people who were great.

2073
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,540
Uh, boy.

2074
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:27,960
Yes.

2075
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:30,040
Oh, you need some help?

2076
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,400
I got you, baby girl.

2077
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:31,900
Run.

2078
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,500
I'm trying to run.

2079
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:34,520
Oh, I'm running.

2080
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:35,440
I'm running.

2081
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:35,900
It sounds like a song.

2082
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:37,400
I'm trying to run.

2083
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,920
I'm trying to run.

2084
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:39,280
Be nice.

2085
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:43,540
I don't need the balls.

2086
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:44,680
I try to run.

2087
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:46,060
Oh, baby.

2088
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,880
Oh, oh, oh, I need to reload.

2089
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:52,260
Hey, you better move.

2090
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,300
No, no, no, I have to run.

2091
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:57,560
I'm opening up my eyes.

2092
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,180
This thing's crazy, this beam.

2093
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,780
I know, you get it at level 20.

2094
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:04,000
I was so happy when I finally got mine.

2095
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,440
I, like, I grind a little bit.

2096
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,000
It's like a badge of honor.

2097
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:08,300
It is.

2098
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:11,440
Because it does take a little while, even if you play the
game a lot.

2099
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,500
I'd say, still tell her about holding R.

2100
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:25,820
you are zoomed in on your gun and press middle button it
gives you like the extra scope which i didn't find out until

2101
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:34,860
like two weeks ago i didn't know i didn't find out until two
weeks ago wait how do you shoot with what like wait so let's

2102
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:41,560
say you're shooting your gun right you're aiming with right
mouse and then click middle mouse isn't that crazy you can

2103
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:50,120
do that with every gun oh my god i didn't know that i didn't
know that also also another one hold r you can change the

2104
01:35:50,120 --> 01:36:01,940
speed i what hold r you hold r on your gun and then what i
believe i can't exactly remember how to switch between the

2105
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:09,660
two but like for my sickle i'm shooting a hundred m per
minute oh my god hundred bullets per minute is that the

2106
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:13,740
fastest because i only want to shoot faster not slower Yeah,
right?

2107
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,200
Higher the number faster it is.

2108
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:18,160
And how do you get the number up?

2109
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,580
It depends if it's sideways.

2110
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:23,040
I think you use your scroll wheel, but I believe it's
like...

2111
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,340
Oh, it's the sideways it means it's gonna go faster.

2112
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:26,920
I don't know if I... Which way I like more.

2113
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,580
No, I'm trying to remember the patrol.

2114
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:31,840
No, it's fine.

2115
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,620
Try not to worry about it.

2116
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:33,400
I don't want to...

2117
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,140

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah!

2136
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:22,180
Oh, yeah!

2137
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:26,080
I don't think I've, uh, I played it, I think, only once,
like, a year ago.

2138
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:26,700
Oh, God.

2139
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:29,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, am I okay?

01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,040
Oh, no, I'm not okay.

01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,400
I would, I would avoid his, uh...

2142
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:34,420
His, uh, everything?

2143
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:38,980
Yeah, you can, like, uh, press off to get out of his attack.

2144
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:41,140
Oh, I definitely did.

2145
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:42,100
Yeah, I did that.

2146
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:43,060
Oh, nice.

2147
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:49,140
The shield also will absorb, I think, like, one damage from
him, but I'm not sure if it's, like, a full.

2148
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,740
Oh, sorry, I shot you in the shield.

2149
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,100
I got him.

2150
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,260
Good job.

2151
01:38:58,220 --> 01:38:59,320
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

2152
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:06,930
We have for some guns if you hold R, you can change the
speed of it, and I can't...

2153
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:07,490
Oh, here we go.

2154
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:08,310
That's crazy.

2155
01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:09,070
Okay.

2156
01:39:09,070 --> 01:39:16,990
So if the bar is up on the gun, you scroll your wheel up to
change oh oh so now i'm used to seeing like one little bug

2157
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:23,230
mess oh wait there's a bug oh oh yeah mint mint mint i'll
let you come mint you have to shoot your grenade inside the

2158
01:39:23,230 --> 01:39:32,090
hole okay you're gonna come here stand here but like you
have to shoot it in good job i did shoot it in yeah sorry

2159
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:37,950
sorry it's just i'm using the grenades that explode
immediately so i forget that like regular grenades take a

2160
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:41,250
while to pop up Sorry.

2161
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:43,890
No, you're okay.

2162
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:47,230
Because mine pops like right away.

2163
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:47,810
This is great.

2164
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:50,350
Oh my god, he was so cute right in my face.

2165
01:39:51,890 --> 01:39:53,210
I can do that by the way.

2166
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:54,630
I have the same flaws.

2167
01:39:54,810 --> 01:39:59,110
Here, now that I'm getting chased by 40,000 dogs, I could
teach you what I was trying to teach you, Mata.

2168
01:40:00,050 --> 01:40:00,370
Sorry?

2169
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:03,170
I could teach you what I was trying to teach you without
being chased.

2170
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:05,010
So stop moving and then hold R.

2171
01:40:05,650 --> 01:40:07,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I saw what it looks like.

2172
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:07,690
Thank you, thank you.

2173
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:09,670
It's like you hold R and then it like switches.

2174
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:20,190
up to change your speed wait oh i'm changing things i don't
know what i'm doing so 100 means faster right yes and you

2175
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:28,290
move your swivel just up to change the speed so right now
you see how oh i see i see it so my default is i was just

2176
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:37,790
shooting slow no 100 is the no 100 is the fastest people are
saying that's range oh that's the scope of the gun oh it

2177
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:49,330
depends on some gun sometimes some My chap said right click
is speed Oh, I have a Oh, there's a flashlight Oh, that's

2178
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:53,550
the scope Okay, so every gun is a little different
apparently Okay

2179
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:00,390
I genuinely

2180
01:41:04,130 --> 01:41:11,250
I genuinely had no idea I'm still I'm so sorry.

2181
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:14,350
Oh my god.

2182
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:17,170
Um, I'm gonna request reinforcement.

2183
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:20,470
I'm so sorry.

2184
01:41:22,770 --> 01:41:24,150
I'm so sorry.

2185
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:29,830
So for some guns, holding R changes the scope, and some
guns, like the machine gun, changes the speed of how you do

2186
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:29,830
it.

2187
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:34,350
Democracy is landing.

2188
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:35,850
Democracy is landing.

2189
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:37,830
Wait, where's our stuff?

2190
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:39,570
You can see it on the map.

2191
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:42,250
That was so fucking funny though.

2192
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:43,590
I'm so sorry.

2193
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:43,930
Wait.

2194
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:45,330
The backpack is there if you want it.

2195
01:41:45,650 --> 01:41:45,730
Yeah.

2196
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:46,030
That's true.

2197
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:46,970
Some guns are different.

2198
01:41:47,490 --> 01:41:49,190
Just holding R changes your settings.

2199
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:50,090
This is yours.

2200
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:50,730
This is yours.

2201
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:51,010
Yeah.

2202
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:51,710
Oh.

2203
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:53,370
I know.

2204
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:56,450
El Diver.

2205
01:41:57,430 --> 01:41:58,650
My knife is right here too.

2206
01:41:58,730 --> 01:41:59,430
Your machine gun.

2207
01:41:59,910 --> 01:42:00,630
Oh, my machine gun.

2208
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:01,150
Thank you.

2209
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:03,650
You guys are so cute.

2210
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:04,430
Kawaii.

2211
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:05,710
No, you.

2212
01:42:07,170 --> 01:42:07,930
No, you.

2213
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:12,730
Oh no, no big guy.

2214
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:28,850
I guess it would be like, Oh no, are you a traitor?

2215
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:30,770
Wait, are you a filthy traitor?

2216
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:33,690
Don't get out of the combat zone.

2217
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:37,590
How do I get back to the combat zone?

2218
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:40,190
You have to run back to the combat zone!

2219
01:42:40,330 --> 01:42:40,990
That's the way!

2220
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:42,610
I'm back on that tree!

2221
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:45,090
I'm not a traitor!

2222
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:46,830
I'm democratic!

2223
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:47,970
I'm democratic!

2224
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:51,970
I cannot believe- I think the game glitched again.

2225
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:54,070
I said I was killed by HU wedding.

2226
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:56,310
Wait, what?

2227
01:42:56,430 --> 01:43:02,330
I think the game is glitched.

2228
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:04,570
It was really glitched.

2229
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:06,510
I think once again, you're coping.

2230
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:11,030
Wait, I'm going to kill her this time!

2231
01:43:11,690 --> 01:43:13,010
Hanya, you're a murderer.

2232
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:16,210
Hanya is a tiny little baby murderer.

2233
01:43:16,970 --> 01:43:17,390
Dude, oh, wait.

2234
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:22,130
I was going to do the shark song, but you're on the YouTube,
so we're going to be careful not to say that.

2235
01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:23,270
What song?

2236
01:43:24,030 --> 01:43:26,130
I was going to say baby murderer.

2237
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:27,490
Oh, I think it's okay.

2238
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:31,630
It's not, you know, it's going to be like, oh, that
definitely can't be the original.

2239
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:34,730
It sounds like an old hag saying it's not like a different
baby.

2240
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:35,450
Oh, so...

2241
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:37,910

Gun dancer.

Die already.

2254
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:24,630
How is he alive without his butt?

I've never seen him before.

2257
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:28,130
Stop camping.

2258
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:29,510
He's obsessed with me.

2259
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:30,510
I know why.

2260
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:31,150
But I can't.

What the heck?

2263
01:44:33,690 --> 01:44:35,430

I'm gonna throw and you go at it.

2277
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:56,220
I already threw one.

2278
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:57,060
Hee.

2279
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:59,700
All the way over here, Dayo.

2280
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:02,560
All the way over here, Dayo.

2281
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:03,920
Oh, there we go.

2282
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,120
Where I just pinged.

2283
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:06,140
Oh, okay.

2284
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:07,080
Oh, that's going.

2285
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:09,100
Because this looks like an escort citizen victim.

2286
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:12,900
I'm going to which planet is this.

2287
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:15,380
This is the defense planet, the one that we have in the
mission.

2288
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:15,920
I am coming.

2289
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,000
I'm coming, too.

2290
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:26,620
Nice.

2291
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:29,460
Oh, you're stupid robot.

2292
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:32,720
It's okay.

2293
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:33,360
I had my shield.

2294
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,400
Yeah, the robot, the little robot doesn't discriminate.

2295
01:45:37,740 --> 01:45:39,560
The little robot does not discriminate.

2296
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:40,640
It's true.

2297
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:41,740
He kills anybody.

2298
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:43,060
I'm running.

2299
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,680
Nice use of the little eagles.

2300
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:46,080
Was that you, Min?

2301
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,140
No, I don't have eagles.

2302
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:50,380
Oh, you haven't unlocked them yet.

2303
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:52,160
I'll show you where to unlock them after this game.

2304
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:53,240
Can you guys remind me?

2305
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:54,280
Yep.

2306
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,000
Hey, Ma, make sure you tell Min about the eagles,
stratagems.

2307
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,420
Oh, yeah, I will.

2308
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,400
Yeah, don't forget about it, though.

2309
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:04,360
Actually, Haruka, you can tell her about it.

2310
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,920
Because you can probably teach her how to aim better than I
can aim.

2311
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:08,240
Yeah, I'll help you.

2312
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:09,180
I'll be with you.

2313
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:10,240
I'll be your buddy, Matal.

2314
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:13,420
I just kind of say, fuck it, we ball and hope for the best
sometimes.

2315
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:14,680
Yeah, come on.

2316
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:15,480
I'm here.

2317
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,020
Haruka, we're in polite society.

2318
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:20,200
Mint is a polite little one.

2319
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:20,920
She's on the YouTube.

2320
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:22,820
We can't be swearing like this.

2321
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:24,260
What?

2322
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:28,000
I'm part of a freedom society, actually.

2323
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:30,800
A managed democratic society.

2324
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:31,260
Can I say fuck, then?

2325
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:32,700
Can I say fuck, then?

2326
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:34,640
If anything, you're unmanaged.

2327
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,400
Wait, bitch, so does that mean I can say fuck now?

2328
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:39,840
Oh, goddamn.

2329
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:41,800
She's going in.

2330
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:42,760
She's going in.

2331
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,380
She's going in.

2332
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:45,620
Thank you, Min.

2333
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,240
I can say fuck now.

2334
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:48,480
No, don't say thanks to me.

2335
01:46:48,940 --> 01:46:50,060
Say thanks to Neil.

2336
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:51,100
Huh?

2337
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:51,960
Thank you.

2338
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:54,980
You always make sure to resupply since you have a gun with
bullets.

2339
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,620
If you ever see bullets on the ground.

2340
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:57,980
Have a gun with bullets.

2341
01:46:58,660 --> 01:47:01,000
Well, it's because mine, mine all don't have bullets.

2342
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:03,720
Look at you fancy pants.

2343
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:04,540
I know.

2344
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:08,440
I did it because, okay, see the one, one of them is like
spitting something.

2345
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,140
He's like farting into the, oh, too late.

2346
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:11,320
I didn't see.

2347
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:11,740
It's all right.

2348
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:12,440
It's okay.

2349
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:12,920
We specialize.

2350
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:15,880
Realize.

2351
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:16,960
Realize.

2352
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:19,560
She believes.

2353
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,140
She believes.

2354
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:22,700
She believes.

2355
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:22,860
Oh no.

2356
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:24,180
I hate the butt man.

2357
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:24,440
It's okay.

2358
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:24,960
I got him.

2359
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:25,180
I got him.

2360
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:25,340
I got him.

2361
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:27,800
Oh, they're always obsessed with me.

2362
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,840
Oh my god, it's because you smell so minty.

2363
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:31,760
So cute.

2364
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:33,200
Let me kill the little bugs.

2365
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,260
This always happens at picnics.

2366
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,080
The bugs come after me mode.

2367
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:37,500
Really?

2368
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:38,720
Oh, you're gonna hate me.

2369
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:39,700
They never come after me.

2370
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:48,220

01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:17,580
Good job.

2375
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:20,820
I know.

2376
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:21,280
I know.

2377
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:22,500
I can do this one.

2378
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:23,580
I can do this one.

2379
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:24,040
Wait.

2380
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:26,480
Do you need some bullets, Vint?

2381
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:27,600
Maybe.

2382
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:29,020
I'm gonna grab some.

2383
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:29,660
Yeah.

2384
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:30,460
What's this?

2385
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:37,500
That's, you always feel like you run out of bullets until
you kind of start learning where to look for bullets and

2386
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,000
grenades.

2387
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:38,560

Oh.

2399
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,240
Busting made me feel good.

2400
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:45,920
There's usually more than one.

2401
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:47,660
There's usually like two or three samples.

2402
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:48,740
So I'm just looking to see.

2403
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:49,140
Okay.

2404
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,340
But I think here there was only one.

2405
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:53,440
Busting.

2406
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:53,860
Busting.

2407
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:55,020
Busting.

2408
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:55,420
Busting.

2409
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:55,540
Busting.

2410
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:56,020
Busting.

2411
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:02,780
Sometimes, you know, she'll come here and say stuff.

2412
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:05,280
And I'm like, ah, gotta let her live her best life.

2413
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:06,960
I love that for her.

2414
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:08,600
I'm happy.

2415
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:09,180
Yay.

2416
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:16,580

2419
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:39,660

2420
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:40,480
I'm just following you.

2421
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:40,880
Sorry.

2422
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:44,240
Yeah, I'm always trying to, like, double-check around
because I'm always looking for samples and stuff.

2423
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:45,040
Stop the imp.

2424
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:46,980
There's an extra gun here, too, if you have.

2425
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,000
Another gun?

2426
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:50,120
There we go.

2427
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:51,680
But you already have a machine gun, I think.

2428
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:52,340
Yeah, I do.

2429
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:54,060
Assholes.

2430
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:57,380
When you summon things, dude, does it cost money?

2431
01:50:58,540 --> 01:50:59,460
Summon what things?

2432
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,740
Like, if I have to summon ammo and stuff, does it cost
money?

2433
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:02,940
Nope.

2434
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:03,700
No, no, no, no, no.

2435
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:05,580
It's just that we all share a pool of some.

2436
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:08,180
So, you have, like, you see the stratagems that I use there,
the eagle?

2437
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:14,580
That I have limited amount of those but then they resupply
they go on cool down same for your gun like your gun is free

2438
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:20,840
but it has a cool down okay you can only summon it like
three or four times in a game which is why when you die it's

2439
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:28,680
nice to go back to your old gun and pick it up yeah okay
that makes sense you got like 300 gifted why not 400 huh we

2440
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:37,620
gotta go back in the back you go back where i could stay
here and do the bug nest and then activate there's uh i

2441
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:40,520
don't I'll go.

2442
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:41,860
I'll stay.

2443
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:42,240
You know what?

2444
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:45,260
I'll go by myself.

2445
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:48,460
Yeah, I'll- I'll stay.

2446
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:51,240
I was gonna go, but if we're...

2447
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:52,000
You can do whatever.

2448
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:53,000

2487
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:05,300

2488
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:15,740
many times oh kenya have you been to fujikyu yeah i have
what's your favorite favorite um roller coaster thing to do

2489
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:31,320
there it's crazy that's the name of it though yeah so what
is it what is it do what is the attraction so usually when

2490
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:38,640
you go on the roller coaster you have a place to put your
but on that one it's like you're in the midair so you have

2491
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:45,840
to take off your shoes yeah and you're flying around in the
midair and then they're doing a spinning good 30 60 degree

2492
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:53,680
and a lot of stuff the seats that's the stuff i don't like
the seats spin too it's real it's really crazy i also like

2493
01:54:53,680 --> 01:55:03,380
kujiyama too no it wasn't so bad for me fine and what's
fujiyama like i think it's a tallest one in the japan yeah

2494
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:09,820
oh is it like the proper roller coaster you go up you go
down yeah yeah yeah there's one there's one or at the top

2495
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:17,800
you get to see like a good view of mount fuji yeah i like
that i like that if you're wearing glasses you have to take

2496
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:29,240
it off yeah yeah no i don't food food it's fine it's fine oh
i think they have they have a like a little i don't know if

2497
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:35,500
they have a restaurant because i never been to but uh they
got a little like a market thingy going on outside so can

2498
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:41,500
just like get the some cheap food for 100 yen or one again i
feel like they have that everywhere right the little street

2499
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:51,900
oh that's not so good or they got the combini really cool so
we just go combini and get some stuff and we just ready to

2500
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:59,720
go back on the roller coaster that's what i do it's because
uh in in not in japan and like other countries usually the

2501
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:06,220
whenever you go into the amusement park you can't come out
so they make you curious so that you order expensive food

2502
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:16,040
what i've always been able to you can go back out really i
guess that's maybe just uh north like these canadian things

2503
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:22,380
because they oh my goodness there's usually no food near it
so you basically have to eat over over christ dude there

2504
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:29,120
wait really yeah but they let you leave because they'll
sometimes like stamp your thing right yeah they give you a

2505
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:35,700
little stamp there's no on your body oh yeah that's true for
a lot there's not even a convenient there's usually no food

2506
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:41,180
nearby so that way you kind of have to buy food there which
is pretty expensive right oh there's a little man there's a

2507
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:51,900

02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:16,980
They're filled with mommos.

2610
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:19,460
That's where I hide my mommos before I eat them.

2611
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:21,220
I'm pretty sure you hide some stim pack inside.

2612
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:22,040
You got this.

2613
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:24,020
No, I hide my mommos before I eat them.

2614
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:25,180
How do I get the other packs?

2615
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:27,680
Oh, I got some samples.

2616
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:29,260
Samples.

2617
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:30,400
Beautiful mint.

2618
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:31,340
I, I, I, I.

2619
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:32,760
Wait, how do I get around there?

2620
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:33,740
Uh oh.

2621
02:01:33,820 --> 02:01:35,260
Uh, just over here.

2622
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:36,340
Oh, I see it.

2623
02:01:37,220 --> 02:01:37,660
Thanks.

2624
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:38,660
I got you, fam.

2625
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,060
Thanks, fam.

2626
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:40,960
I was in trouble.

2627
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:41,400
Love you.

2628
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,820
I thought you were big.

2629
02:01:44,860 --> 02:01:46,300
Take my ego!

2630
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:47,340
Yay!

2631
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:49,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2632
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:49,700
Henya!

2633
02:01:53,020 --> 02:01:56,720
I would think that was personal if I didn't know you a
little better, Henya.

2634
02:01:56,980 --> 02:01:57,420
No.

2635
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:58,780
You didn't die.

2636
02:01:58,980 --> 02:01:59,960
You're fine.

2637
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:02,180
I didn't die yet.

2638
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:03,380
The night is young, Henya.

2639
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:05,480
Anything can happen.

2640
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:06,480
It's full of...

2641
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:07,380
You didn't die.

2642
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:08,300
That's important.

2643
02:02:08,380 --> 02:02:09,200
That's important, Daniel.

2644
02:02:09,220 --> 02:02:10,100
I mean, we can just...

2645
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:11,620
Watch us from afar if you want.

2646
02:02:11,780 --> 02:02:13,640
The knight is young and killed with Loba.

2647
02:02:14,580 --> 02:02:14,920
Oh, okay.

2648
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:15,540
There you go.

2649
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:15,780
Yeah.

2650
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:17,380
She's a little...

2651
02:02:17,380 --> 02:02:18,320
She's a little...

2652
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:19,140
Watch up on your right.

2653
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:19,740
Freak!

2654
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:21,120
I'm a little freak!

2655
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:22,320
Yeah, you are.

2656
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:23,400
I want your blood on me!

2657
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:25,340
Yep.

2658
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:28,020
The smaller they are, the more...

2659
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:30,240
The closer they are to hell.

2660
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:31,420
Yeah, there we go.

2661
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:31,960
That's definitely not me.

2662
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:33,240
That's definitely not me, then.

2663
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:38,740
Oh, Henny, pretty small and pretty crazy.

2664
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:44,420
Hang on, I think you're fucked up like the rest of us.

2665
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:48,120
Not as much as you!

2666
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:50,560
Um, what do you mean?

2667
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:53,180
Nah, not as much as you.

2668
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:57,230
I don't know, I might have killed a few things in my day.

2669
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:01,600
Hara, you're the most toxic Canadian I ever see it.

2670
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:01,940
Yes.

2671
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:03,760
It's not gonna hit us, you know.

2672
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:04,520
I know.

2673
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:06,000
I put it over there, though.

2674
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:06,800
Oh, okay.

2675
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:07,820
Hara, Hara, Hara.

2676
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:10,100
You're the most toxic Canadian I ever see.

2677
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:11,660
I've seen it before, so you...

2678
02:03:11,660 --> 02:03:13,100
That's an honor.

2679
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:15,980
Because there's not a lot of us in this world anymore.

2680
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:18,800
We Canadians are going extinct.

2681
02:03:19,060 --> 02:03:19,980
Canadians are going extinct.

2682
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:20,480
It's true.

2683
02:03:20,900 --> 02:03:22,040
There's barely any Canadians left.

2684
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:27,540
Every 10 Americans I meet online, I see one Canadian, and we
all go far out because we never meet a Canadian online.

2685
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:28,440
It's true.

2686
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:31,100
I feel like there's so many Canadian V-Tubers.

2687
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:32,340
There are.

2688
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:33,500
Yeah, they are.

2689
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:34,300
There's so many.

2690
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:37,080
Yeah, for us, Canadians, we can't...

2691
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:37,420
Okay.

2692
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:39,560
I don't know how to explain for us Canadians.

2693
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:47,060
see each other ever oh wait wait can you tell by their how
they talk can you tell they're a canadian or american or

2694
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:56,420
stuff like that can you tell uh no oh sometimes because
because we've been so critically online that our accent gets

2695
02:03:56,420 --> 02:04:07,660
hidden away it does oh i see it it only happens with some
words like sorry beg tag bagel bagel and bagel i say bagel

2696
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:11,500
bagel bagel what is it What is the Canadian way of saying
bagel?

2697
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:12,640
Bagel.

2698
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:14,800
It's bagel.

2699
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,000
It's bagel.

2700
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:17,300
Bagel.

2701
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:18,800
Bagel.

2702
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:19,000
Bagel.

2703
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,760
Sweet Liberty.

2704
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:22,600
My leg!

2705
02:04:22,980 --> 02:04:23,900
My leg!

2706
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:24,940
My gai.

2707
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:26,780
I feel really patriotic.

2708
02:04:28,120 --> 02:04:28,400
Right?

2709
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:30,280
This game just brings out the patriotism.

2710
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:34,300
My gai has survived three missions and it's so fucking
dirty.

2711
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:35,620
Holy shit he needs a bang.

2712
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:36,900
Nice.

2713
02:04:36,900 --> 02:04:38,560

02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:43,400
Hadoo, can you show her where to buy stratagems and stuff?

2715

Eagle.

Yeah, I use the eagles a lot.

2752
02:06:57,700 --> 02:06:58,800
I use the eagle airstrike.

2753
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:00,640
It's the one that I use.

2754
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:00,740
Me too.

2755
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:01,240

If it misses, it's the government's fault.

2776
02:07:58,700 --> 02:07:59,500
The government!

2777
02:08:00,660 --> 02:08:00,980

I like the eagle.

2780
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:08,840

I have like a bomb thing, but I haven't used it because I'm
bad about remembering to use it.

Well, you get used to it.

2784
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:18,700
Yeah.

2785
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:20,200
Maybe I will get the rifle.

2786
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:23,540
It's up to you.

2787
02:08:23,640 --> 02:08:26,160
The best part is that experimenting isn't having fun.

2788
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:41,080
get the sniper then be disappointed why is it disappointment
well it's a shitty gun oh the the material rifle i'm looking

2790
02:08:52,180 --> 02:08:53,560
it when shooting big bonds

2791
02:09:09,620 --> 02:09:20,160
Oh, Henya, I need your advice.

2792
02:09:21,700 --> 02:09:21,960
What is it?

2793
02:09:22,140 --> 02:09:23,840
A friend and I disagree on this.

2794
02:09:24,740 --> 02:09:31,000
When I go to maid cafes with this friend, I will say, I
should do to the maids.

2795
02:09:31,220 --> 02:09:31,860
And they love it.

2796
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,680
And my friend says it's embarrassing.

2797
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:34,480
What do you think?

2798
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:37,220
Well, the thing is, I never really go outside.

2799
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:40,260
I never went to the makeup, so I don't know how to interact
with them.

2800
02:09:40,700 --> 02:09:44,560
But do you think it is embarrassing if I say...

2801
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:44,740
Nah!

2802
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:47,220
Nah, people love it.

2803
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:47,800
Grude.

2804
02:09:47,880 --> 02:09:48,680
They love it.

2805
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:50,040
I'm telling you, they love it.

2806
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:53,140
They light up, or they're too polite to say otherwise, but
they love it.

2807
02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:54,740
No, love it.

2808
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:56,440
I'll tell my friend what you said.

2809
02:09:57,780 --> 02:09:58,300
my friend.

2810
02:09:58,440 --> 02:09:59,240
I'll let her know.

2811
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:01,960
You tell her that she's wrong, the deadly wrong.

2812
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:02,560
Can I tell her?

2813
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:04,260
She's stinky and wrong.

2814
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:05,880
She's stinky and wrong.

2815
02:10:07,780 --> 02:10:10,320
Why do I have a feeling that the friend you're talking about
is in this call right now?

2816
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:11,000
How do I...

2817
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:11,300
That's crazy.

2818
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:11,700
Oh, purchase.

2819
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:13,180
No, no way.

2820
02:10:13,580 --> 02:10:14,420
No way.

2821
02:10:14,740 --> 02:10:14,760
No way.

2822
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:15,680
That friend is here.

2823
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:16,700
No, not at all.

2824
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:18,400
That would be so awful.

2825
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:20,160
Yeah, I know.

2826
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,740
That person probably sucks so much.

2827
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:23,500
Wait.

2828
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:23,960
I know.

2829
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:25,780
I need to get into the mission.

2830
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:27,700
Buh.

2831
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:30,200
I did it.

2832
02:10:30,380 --> 02:10:31,340
Nice deal!

2833
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:34,460
It's open.

2834
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:40,060
Yeah, they probably suck.

2835
02:10:41,340 --> 02:10:45,460
I'm just looking at Min's face and she has a smiley eyes
right now.

2836
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:49,360
Well, are you looking at my face, Haruka?

2837
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:49,840
Huh?

2838
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,020
You want to kiss it or something?

2839
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:51,660
What do you want?

2840
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:52,540
Yeah, I missed it.

2841
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:54,160
It's been, what, three years?

2842
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:57,080
I've been seeing your face for three years!

2843
02:10:57,780 --> 02:10:58,420
I'm lonely.

2844
02:10:58,800 --> 02:10:59,660
I'm so mad.

2845
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,680
Honestly, I could have gone a bit more time without seeing
your face, but here we are.

2846
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:04,420
That's fucked.

2847
02:11:04,420 --> 02:11:05,240
It's your fault.

2848
02:11:05,460 --> 02:11:05,980
I'm here.

2849
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:08,640
What?

2850
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:12,760
I don't even understand where I screwed up in my summoning
ritual.

2851
02:11:13,660 --> 02:11:14,460
I have no idea.

2852
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:15,980
It is your fault.

2853
02:11:16,140 --> 02:11:17,820
It's because you were you.

2854
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:20,380
It's because you just did your own thing.

2855
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:21,160
You're a screw up.

2856
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:22,900
That's just the natural part.

2857
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:24,540
How the fuck?

2858
02:11:24,540 --> 02:11:26,340
You sound just like my mom.

2859
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:29,560
Oh, sorry.

2860
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:32,280
My Okasan says the same thing.

2861
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:33,220
My Okan.

2862
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:39,520
Wah, wah, wah.

2863
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:42,360
I love that song.

2864
02:11:50,980 --> 02:11:53,360
The song they were seeing earlier.

2865
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:54,420
Oh, he mean, Rhapsody?

2866
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:55,680
Yes.

2867
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:57,000
It is.

2868
02:11:57,460 --> 02:12:00,380
Okay, so I have not played this before.

2869
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:01,200
Whoa.

2870
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:02,280
Oh, is it a siege?

2871
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:03,640
Okay, we have to go.

2872
02:12:03,660 --> 02:12:05,660
go in and we have to defend the siege.

2873
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:09,160
Defend the siege.

2874
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:10,940
Over here.

2875
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:12,280
Is Mint not streaming on Twitch?

2876
02:12:12,660 --> 02:12:13,780
Press exclamation mark Mint.

2877
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:15,360
It'll get you to her YouTube channel.

2878
02:12:15,620 --> 02:12:17,140
Sorry, I only stream on YouTube.

2879
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:23,760
But if you ever watch YouTube streamers, how do we get in to
this building?

2880
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:24,600
I'm going over here.

2881
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:25,580
I'm here.

2882
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:27,220
How do I get in?

2883
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:29,040
Over here.

2884
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:30,660

mission.

02:13:04,220 --> 02:13:09,340
Even if everybody dies and the timer runs out, as long as
you complete the main mission, you'll still get the score.

2892
02:13:09,980 --> 02:13:10,480

Click.

Where's a good place?

2930
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:27,220
Oh, they broke the door because we weren't defending it.

2931
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:27,780
Oh.

02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:28,760
Oh, be careful.

Oh my goodness.

2934
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:31,240
How do I use this thing?

2935
02:14:32,580 --> 02:14:33,020
It's okay.

2936
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:33,440
It's okay.

We'll be fine.

2938
02:14:34,060 --> 02:14:34,960
We'll be fine.

02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:35,700
Oh, my bad.

2943
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:42,740
I'm shooting a bug.

2944
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:46,020
I really did summon us to the wrong place.

2945
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:46,480
My bad.

2946
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:48,780
No, it's out of.

2947
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,320
Uh, how do I get out of this thing?

2948
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:51,500
Uh, uh, wait.

2949
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:52,880
Oh, no.

2950
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:53,860
Wait, I'm stuck.

2951
02:14:54,040 --> 02:14:54,360
Okay, guys.

2952
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:55,900
You have to launch the rockets.

2953
02:14:56,060 --> 02:14:56,560
It looks like.

2954
02:14:57,020 --> 02:14:58,200
Oh, we have to actually.

2955
02:14:58,480 --> 02:14:58,720
Uh-oh.

2956
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:00,500
How do I get off the rocket?

2957
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:01,620
We can also...

2958
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:04,400
E?

2959
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:07,080
Oh, E.

Thanks, chat.

2962
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:10,860
We can also fall back, by the way.

2963
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:12,960
If some of these are open, we can fall back.

2964
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:15,480
Matara killed me, so...

2965
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:17,300
I don't know what she's talking about.

2966
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:20,540
I have the facts.

2967
02:15:20,980 --> 02:15:21,860
Oh, it doesn't automatically.

2968
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:22,900
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2969
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:24,780
Don't know what she's talking about.

2970
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:28,340
Oh, I spawn inside of a man.

2971
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:30,320
Holding dollar.

2972
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:31,800
Oh, my God, you're just like my momos.

2973
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:33,040
That's how they are born.

2974
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:36,500
Oh, I should have brought tourists.

2975
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:38,140
I actually don't know what the mission is.

2976
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:39,120
Oh, hello.

2977
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:45,360
Oh, they closed the door on us, but it's okay.

2978
02:15:45,580 --> 02:15:46,000
It's okay.

2979
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:47,020
They don't love us.

2980
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:47,580
It's fine.

2981
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:48,480
It's fine.

2982
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:50,500
Hey, I wouldn't need her if I was them.

2983
02:15:51,860 --> 02:15:52,960
Yeah, never come back here.

2984
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:54,300
I don't want to see your face anymore.

2985
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,900
We can also open it from our side.

2986
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:57,440
Tascado!

2987
02:15:58,680 --> 02:15:59,860
How does that feel, Mint?

2988
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:01,740
Your ocean just told you you just got gone.

2989
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:02,840
I absolutely love it.

2990
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:04,640
What the fuck?

2991
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:07,040
Call me gross!

2992
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:09,200
Call me gross!

2993
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:13,980
Call me stinky gross and disgusting.

2994
02:16:14,120 --> 02:16:16,100
Mint, I don't know you're a massacist.

2995
02:16:16,780 --> 02:16:19,940
Yeah, it's one of my, you know, the M and Mint stands for.

2996
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:23,320
M, M, M, M, S, S.

2997
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:25,700
Uh, okay.

2998
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:27,800
I am doing a Gatling turn.

2999
02:16:27,820 --> 02:16:29,100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3000
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:30,640
I put my Gatling turn, man.

3001
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:31,840
Okay.

3002
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:37,240
Eagle.

3003
02:16:37,460 --> 02:16:39,420
I hope my Gatling is activated.

3004
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:40,080
Watch out!

3005
02:16:41,400 --> 02:16:41,760
Oh!

3006
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:42,800
Right?

3007
02:16:43,100 --> 02:16:43,880
Did I screw it up?

3008
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:45,000
Did I screw up my Gatling?

3009
02:16:45,460 --> 02:16:46,760
I think it died.

3010
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:47,880
I think it got exploded.

3011
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:49,280
Yeah, I could only screw it up.

3012
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:50,520
It had no bullets, though.

3013
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:51,260
It had no bullets.

3014
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:53,160
What, didn't?

3015
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:53,920
The thing.

3016
02:16:54,060 --> 02:16:54,840
I need my bullets!

3017
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:56,360
More bullets!

3018
02:16:56,680 --> 02:16:57,280
I need more bullets!

3019
02:16:58,280 --> 02:16:58,380
More bullets!

3020
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:00,980
I'm going to go up here and I'm going to fight.

3021
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,680
Watch out for my laser, um, Fanta.

3022
02:17:02,820 --> 02:17:03,620
Good job, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3023
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:06,120
Ooh.

3024
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:13,300
Wow, it's just like, oh, wait, I can also use lazy or not
lazy.

3025
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:14,600
I have an evil.

3026
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:16,500
Yeah, you can use it.

3027
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:18,460
Wait until they start coming in.

3028
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:19,660
Wait until you see like that.

3029
02:17:21,060 --> 02:17:22,120
Look at you, you're an original.

3030
02:17:22,460 --> 02:17:23,040
I mean, a natural.

3031
02:17:23,420 --> 02:17:23,700
I'm a natural.

3032
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:25,060
See, like, over there, I'm an original.

3033
02:17:25,820 --> 02:17:28,500
Oh, that is smart.

3034
02:17:28,620 --> 02:17:28,920
Original.

3035
02:17:30,560 --> 02:17:31,820
So if I...

3036
02:17:31,820 --> 02:17:33,780
These are the genius as evil as you.

3037
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:34,760
You're a big natural.

3038
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:35,300
Oh, oh, oh.

3039
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:35,720
Yay.

3040
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:37,740
You're a large natural.

3041
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:38,480
I'm a natural.

3042
02:17:39,380 --> 02:17:40,060
You're a big natural.

3043
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:40,700
Oh, wait.

3044
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:43,800
Then I throw it.

3045
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:44,680
Yeah.

3046
02:17:45,460 --> 02:17:47,020
It's basically like a granati.

3047
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:49,080
Say hello to the lava.

3048
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:52,380
The way you're facing is the way you're going back the line,
basically.

3049
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:53,900
Think of like your...

3050
02:17:54,560 --> 02:17:55,740
It's like a basketball.

3051
02:17:56,040 --> 02:17:56,840
Oh, I'm out of ammo.

3052
02:17:57,240 --> 02:17:58,260
Let's see.

3053
02:17:58,660 --> 02:17:59,300
Come here.

3054
02:17:59,380 --> 02:17:59,960
I have ammo.

3055
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:00,960
You do?

3056
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:03,260
I'm my best.

3057
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:05,600
Oh, there's ammo right here.

3058
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:06,420
There's ammo right here.

3059
02:18:06,860 --> 02:18:07,880
I just had a connection error.

3060
02:18:07,940 --> 02:18:08,200
Oh, wait.

3061
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:10,040
Oh, you can come back.

3062
02:18:10,120 --> 02:18:12,220

Okay, okay.

Oh, I'm good.

02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:17,940

You know what?

3118
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:39,320
We don't need enemies when it's all of us.

3119
02:20:39,420 --> 02:20:40,380
We can just do it.

3120
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:41,960
We can be each other's enemies.

3121
02:20:42,460 --> 02:20:43,320
Yeah, there we go.

3122
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:47,720
What the heck?

3123
02:20:48,040 --> 02:20:49,580
We can be each other's enemies.

3124
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:55,140
That is so fucked up.

3125
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:55,760

Only in the head.

3131
02:21:07,400 --> 02:21:08,720
Only in all the wrong ways.

3132
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:10,100

3133
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:13,700

Moshi.

3139
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:19,260
Moshi.

3140
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:19,420
Moshi.

3141
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:23,040
That wasn't me!

3142
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:24,120
That wasn't Hanya!

3143
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:25,000
That was me!

3144
02:21:25,460 --> 02:21:27,000
No, I didn't do anything!

3145
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:29,560
Hanya, you killed me!

3146
02:21:31,690 --> 02:21:32,630
Hanya, be careful!

3147
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:33,990
What the fuck?

3148
02:21:39,810 --> 02:21:42,810
Guys, I think we need to restart.

3149
02:21:42,990 --> 02:21:44,390
I don't think the rocket's going up.

3150
02:21:44,390 --> 02:21:45,290
I don't think so.

3151
02:21:45,550 --> 02:21:46,430
I've only told you guys.

3152
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:47,730
All right, let's get out of this.

3153
02:21:48,070 --> 02:21:48,870
I saw an Oshi.

3154
02:21:49,310 --> 02:21:50,310
What's going on in here?

3155
02:21:50,530 --> 02:21:52,230
It's an honor to kill my Oshi.

3156
02:21:53,470 --> 02:21:53,970
Uh-huh.

3157
02:21:54,570 --> 02:21:55,130
Uh-huh.

3158
02:21:55,150 --> 02:21:55,810
It's an honor.

3159
02:21:55,890 --> 02:21:56,450
It's an honor.

3160
02:21:56,710 --> 02:21:56,790
Oh.

3161
02:21:57,390 --> 02:21:58,070
Uh-huh.

3162
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:58,570
We're alive.

3163
02:21:58,630 --> 02:22:00,110
I think the mission was booked.

3164
02:22:00,590 --> 02:22:02,170
Man, you killed me.

3165
02:22:02,790 --> 02:22:03,710

Jump complete.

3179
02:23:16,850 --> 02:23:20,270
Oh, if it was good enough for the kings in Europe, it's good
enough for me.

Oh, yeah.

3183
02:23:27,150 --> 02:23:27,690
Oh, yeah.

3184
02:23:28,050 --> 02:23:29,610
This is really fucked up.

3185
02:23:29,770 --> 02:23:31,030
I say so, so myself.

3186
02:23:31,510 --> 02:23:32,310
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

3187
02:23:32,350 --> 02:23:34,650
Why is it all farting in this planet?

3188
02:23:34,890 --> 02:23:35,930
It's all farting, though.

3189
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:38,110
Thank you.

3190
02:23:38,570 --> 02:23:39,650
Thank you.

3191
02:23:39,670 --> 02:23:40,410
Uh oh.

3192
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:42,030
It's because it's the planet.

3193
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:44,630
Our planet's farting though.

3194
02:23:45,050 --> 02:23:48,990
Yeah, the planet is making a lot of gas, making shit hard
for us to see.

3195
02:23:50,710 --> 02:23:51,230
Oh.

3196
02:23:51,910 --> 02:23:52,230
The smell.

3197
02:23:55,190 --> 02:23:58,010
Oh, it's not giving me a drop point at all.

3198
02:23:58,250 --> 02:23:58,930
That was really weird.

3199
02:23:59,170 --> 02:24:01,790
Oh, is it because of the spore towers?

3200
02:24:02,170 --> 02:24:02,310
Oof.

3201
02:24:04,130 --> 02:24:05,510
No, not the spore towers.

3202
02:24:05,570 --> 02:24:07,210
The spore towers can only do so much.

3203
02:24:07,230 --> 02:24:13,090
but like it's not like letting me see anything can I get um
water no that's the that's the planet it's a gas planet so

3207
02:24:37,410 --> 02:24:40,870
Hey everybody, do you love your Oshii?

3208
02:24:41,430 --> 02:24:41,550
No.

3209
02:24:42,070 --> 02:24:47,090
Consider gifting five gifted subs right now to them.

3210
02:24:47,470 --> 02:24:48,010
Yeah, I agree.

3211
02:24:48,430 --> 02:24:49,790
Show your love while they're gone.

3212
02:24:50,330 --> 02:24:52,590
It's more fun to spoil them when they're not here.

3213
02:24:53,490 --> 02:24:55,710
That way you can't get yelled at for spoiling them.

3214
02:24:55,790 --> 02:24:58,830
Unless you like being yelled at for spoiling them, then
spoil them when they're back.

3215
02:24:59,010 --> 02:24:59,830
I hope you're having fun.

3216
02:24:59,950 --> 02:25:01,610
I mean, Mid likes being yelled at.

3217
02:25:02,050 --> 02:25:04,430
You know who clearly doesn't love being spoiled enough?

3218
02:25:04,470 --> 02:25:06,630
Haruka, because you never freaking stream.

3219
02:25:07,230 --> 02:25:16,290
I've literally streamed on Monday and then I had what about
before that I had remember I streamed for our new member I

3220
02:25:16,290 --> 02:25:34,110

should get the sub to Matara Khan for bringing us together

3221
02:25:34,110 --> 02:25:41,210
for this collab and it's she's a wonderful human human being

3228
02:26:08,990 --> 02:26:09,770

Well, I have now successfully dominated all three channels
at once.

3233
02:26:22,130 --> 02:26:24,150
Mata may have me muted, but she didn't deafen me.

3234
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:27,350
So everyone can hear me.

3235
02:26:28,890 --> 02:26:29,390

heck why there's so many I don't know!

3242
02:27:06,610 --> 02:27:07,890
It's Haruka's fault!

3243
02:27:08,030 --> 02:27:08,790
She did that!

3244
02:27:10,190 --> 02:27:11,090
It's her fault!

3245
02:27:11,710 --> 02:27:13,550
Also, Haruka also has a hype frame.

3246
02:27:14,030 --> 02:27:14,510
Wait, what?

3247
02:27:15,250 --> 02:27:16,310
It's Haruka's fault.

3248
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:17,050
What?

3249
02:27:17,270 --> 02:27:17,610
Wait a minute.

3250
02:27:17,810 --> 02:27:18,010
What?

3251
02:27:18,530 --> 02:27:19,750
I got an egg sandwich!

3252
02:27:20,510 --> 02:27:22,670
Oh, describe taste.

3253
02:27:23,430 --> 02:27:23,930
A game?

3254
02:27:24,650 --> 02:27:24,810
What?

3255
02:27:26,170 --> 02:27:27,150
The fuck?

3256
02:27:28,490 --> 02:27:30,430
I'm typing my own offline chat.

3257
02:27:30,850 --> 02:27:32,070
Get out of here, guys!

3258
02:27:32,350 --> 02:27:33,650
Go out of the people I'm streaming!

3259
02:27:34,930 --> 02:27:35,850
Yeah, sorry.

3260
02:27:36,330 --> 02:27:37,150
Haruka said this thing.

3261
02:27:37,350 --> 02:27:39,790
Haruka said, spoil your Oshi by gifting five gifted.

3262
02:27:39,950 --> 02:27:41,730
So that's why you probably got a lot of them.

3263
02:27:41,830 --> 02:27:43,330
I'm going to let you know right now.

3264
02:27:43,550 --> 02:27:45,010
I don't say Oshi often.

3265
02:27:45,570 --> 02:27:46,150
That's what Tawakon.

3266
02:27:46,450 --> 02:27:47,490
Favorite streamer.

3267
02:27:47,970 --> 02:27:49,850
She doesn't say it often, but she did that one time.

3268
02:27:49,850 --> 02:27:50,870
Wow, you were really good.

3269
02:27:50,990 --> 02:27:52,430
Your impersonation is so bad.

3270
02:27:53,910 --> 02:27:54,530
It's true.

3271
02:27:55,850 --> 02:27:56,770
I hate it here.

3272
02:27:57,210 --> 02:27:58,730
Do you want to eat it a bit before we start?

3273
02:27:59,190 --> 02:27:59,790
I can let you.

3274
02:27:59,910 --> 02:28:00,730
I can let you finish.

3275
02:28:00,990 --> 02:28:01,610
I'm generous.

3276
02:28:01,850 --> 02:28:02,610
No, I'm good.

3277
02:28:02,970 --> 02:28:03,770
Oh, you sure?

3278
02:28:04,010 --> 02:28:04,810
I can't.

3279
02:28:04,950 --> 02:28:05,570
I'm good!

3280
02:28:06,490 --> 02:28:07,950
Might be the only time.

3281
02:28:09,110 --> 02:28:10,010
Yeah, don't worry about it.

3282
02:28:11,250 --> 02:28:11,590
Cool.

3283
02:28:12,250 --> 02:28:13,770
I care about my friend.

3284
02:28:14,030 --> 02:28:15,950
For every bug I kill, I'm gonna take a bite.

3285
02:28:18,730 --> 02:28:20,710
She's gonna snipe me the moment we land.

3286
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:26,650
I mean, you hit this shit every bug and you didn't specify
what kind of bug, so you're kind of fucked.

3287
02:28:27,030 --> 02:28:27,470
Yeah.

3288
02:28:29,990 --> 02:28:32,610
I like the fucking mischievous Glint went to bed.

3289
02:28:33,870 --> 02:28:34,650
Is that that?

Oh, you know what it could be?

You've ruined her.

It is your blood.

3357
02:33:30,460 --> 02:33:34,160
I can't believe Haruka would say that.

3358
02:33:34,360 --> 02:33:36,180
But they're gonna somehow blame me, Haruka.

3359
02:33:36,320 --> 02:33:38,440
Haruka, that's so fucked up that yo.

3360
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:40,320
I'll get blamed for this somehow.

3361
02:33:41,140 --> 02:33:42,300
We'll get blamed together.

3362
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:46,140
Be like, I can't believe Haruka for Bishojo cannot read the
room.

It's unbelievable.

I mean, Haruka and Bishojo.

3365
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:53,700
I can't believe Haruka would do this to my Min from May
channel.

3366
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:56,800
I can't believe Min from May channel.

3367
02:33:57,900 --> 02:33:59,220

02:34:39,180 --> 02:34:40,420
Let me try and summon him.

3379
02:34:40,780 --> 02:34:41,920
It's my distant cousin.

3380
02:34:42,180 --> 02:34:43,200
I want to see him.

3381
02:34:43,220 --> 02:34:44,460
Come here, biotines.

3382
02:34:44,740 --> 02:34:46,260
I saw your joke and they laughed.

3383
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:46,940
How does it feel?

3384
02:34:47,720 --> 02:34:48,160
Biotines.

3385
02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:50,540
Mr. Biotines.

3386
02:34:51,320 --> 02:34:52,660
We're art, though.

3387
02:34:52,860 --> 02:34:53,580
Where are you?

3388
02:34:53,700 --> 02:34:54,560
I'm so excited to see him.

3389
02:34:54,560 --> 02:34:55,480
We're art, thou.

3390
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:56,880
Bioliet.

3391
02:34:59,500 --> 02:34:59,860
Violet.

3392
02:35:00,840 --> 02:35:02,080
Oh, there he is!

3393
02:35:02,180 --> 02:35:02,560
There he is!

3394
02:35:02,560 --> 02:35:03,080
There he is!

3395
02:35:03,320 --> 02:35:03,860
Oh, wow!

3396
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:05,320
Do you see him?

3397
02:35:05,500 --> 02:35:06,060
Zoom into him.

3398
02:35:06,120 --> 02:35:06,440
Do you see him?

3399
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:07,520
Wait, how do I zoom in?

3400
02:35:07,700 --> 02:35:08,180
How do I zoom in?

3401
02:35:08,420 --> 02:35:10,000
Use the little scope on your gun.

3402
02:35:10,320 --> 02:35:10,460
Oh, yeah.

3403
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:12,740
So what I'm in chat saying, don't look me shy.

3404
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:15,820
Whoa, what do I aim for?

3405
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:17,240
Oh, hello.

3406
02:35:18,500 --> 02:35:22,080
Oh, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

3407
02:35:23,380 --> 02:35:27,280
Oh, I just like to tank it.

3408
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:28,980
Oh, I don't...

3409
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:30,860
I like to tank it, tank it.

3410
02:35:30,980 --> 02:35:32,820
I like to tank it.

3411
02:35:33,780 --> 02:35:36,040
Oh my God, there are so many biotitans.

3412
02:35:36,180 --> 02:35:36,900
I mean, not biotitans.

3413
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:37,820
Chargers on this map.

3414
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:38,380
I know.

3415
02:35:40,620 --> 02:35:43,100
There are so many of them.

3416
02:35:44,140 --> 02:35:44,780
Mags empty.

3417
02:35:44,820 --> 02:35:45,300
Oh my God.

3418
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:46,320
Mags empty.

3419
02:35:48,140 --> 02:35:48,900
Mags empty.

3420
02:35:52,180 --> 02:35:53,560
Stinky, stinky, stinky.

3421
02:35:54,420 --> 02:35:56,160
Hey, don't call me that.

3422
02:35:56,340 --> 02:35:57,940
I told you that in confidence.

3423
02:35:58,420 --> 02:35:58,980
I'm sorry.

3424
02:35:59,820 --> 02:36:01,000
You can't help, you know.

3425
02:36:01,380 --> 02:36:02,820
You have no one.

3426
02:36:02,900 --> 02:36:04,220
You know, I want to speak to the truth.

3427
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:05,700
Your stench is just really...

3428
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:08,120
Your stench, I'm sorry.

3429
02:36:08,540 --> 02:36:10,360
I think you guys are smelly.

3430
02:36:10,480 --> 02:36:11,180
Oh, oh, oh.

3431
02:36:11,500 --> 02:36:12,100
I'm inside.

3432
02:36:12,260 --> 02:36:13,200
I'm inside the butt bug.

3433
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:17,160
I know you said I'm insane in public, but I can't hold it
back anymore.

3434
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:18,240
When did you last shower?

3435
02:36:19,500 --> 02:36:20,580
You came last night.

3436
02:36:21,180 --> 02:36:21,420
Okay.

3437
02:36:22,260 --> 02:36:23,460
What about you, mother?

3438
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:25,120
Yeah, this morning.

3439
02:36:26,280 --> 02:36:27,800
Oh, I don't believe you.

3440
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:28,260
I know, I'm sad.

3441
02:36:28,320 --> 02:36:29,080
I want it to be stinky.

3442
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:30,420
I went for a quick run.

3443
02:36:31,460 --> 02:36:32,860
So you were stinky.

3444
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:35,580
Yeah, and then I showered after my run.

3445
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:37,520
Why can't I avoid you guys?

3446
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:40,580
I like when there's a little stinky, you know?

3447
02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:42,400
Oh, I'm slowed.

3448
02:36:42,940 --> 02:36:43,140
Oh, no.

3449
02:36:43,480 --> 02:36:44,420
A little stinky is good.

3450
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:47,000
Sometimes when you're slowed and you took damage, you can
stim yourself.

3451
02:36:47,200 --> 02:36:49,760
That way you'll, like, get a little boost of speed.

3452
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:52,200
It saves you from the snare or whatever.

3453
02:36:57,990 --> 02:37:01,090
I'll submit next time I'm next to you, I can give you a
shield if you want.

3454
02:37:02,270 --> 02:37:04,030
But only if you want it.

3455
02:37:04,390 --> 02:37:08,230
I mean, I don't want your sticky shield or anything, you
know?

3456
02:37:08,830 --> 02:37:09,110
Mine.

3457
02:37:11,790 --> 02:37:12,450
You know what?

3458
02:37:13,110 --> 02:37:13,110
Fine.

3459
02:37:14,110 --> 02:37:15,670
You don't deserve my big shield.

3460
02:37:16,790 --> 02:37:19,170
What is up with you and referencing Yogi?

3461
02:37:19,490 --> 02:37:20,910
I actually, I want to rewatch.

3462
02:37:21,030 --> 02:37:22,830
I think I'm going to watch that for the Patreon.

3463
02:37:24,690 --> 02:37:27,170
You've been referencing it like crazy recently.

3464
02:37:27,350 --> 02:37:29,030
I'm only referencing that one sentence.

3465
02:37:29,650 --> 02:37:31,810
Because I need to rewatch it to reference the other ones.

3466
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:33,990
Well, what were you about to think?

3467
02:37:34,110 --> 02:37:34,870
New Yokiyo.

3468
02:37:34,990 --> 02:37:36,890
It's like the Jaden Smith anime.

3469
02:37:37,230 --> 02:37:38,490
It's so good.

3470
02:37:38,850 --> 02:37:39,250
Oh, geez.

3471
02:37:39,550 --> 02:37:39,630
Oh, geez.

3472
02:37:39,910 --> 02:37:40,490
Oh, God.

3473
02:37:40,970 --> 02:37:42,070
I'm dead.

3474
02:37:43,710 --> 02:37:44,210
I'm down.

3475
02:37:45,090 --> 02:37:45,810
I'm dead.

3476
02:37:46,550 --> 02:37:46,970
I'm dead.

Oh, yeah.

3479
02:37:49,970 --> 02:37:52,810
If you're a ghost and if you die in the game, are you extra
dead?

3480
02:37:53,670 --> 02:37:54,030
Oh, yeah.

3481
02:37:54,330 --> 02:37:55,610
She's never coming back to life.

3482
02:37:55,730 --> 02:37:56,370
No, no, no.

3483
02:37:56,370 --> 02:37:57,950
She won't even be able to be actually plasmed.

3484
02:37:58,550 --> 02:38:00,830
You die in the game, you die in real life.

3485
02:38:00,830 --> 02:38:07,450

Why did you kill me, Matara?

3495
02:39:06,880 --> 02:39:07,920
Why did you kill me?

3496
02:39:07,940 --> 02:39:11,060
Because, because, because I'll just revive you in the next
spot.

3497
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:11,420
No.

3498
02:39:11,880 --> 02:39:12,940
Away from that.

3499
02:39:13,340 --> 02:39:13,820
Matara!

Matara reinforce with me now!

3501
02:39:17,640 --> 02:39:19,080
Reinforce me right now!

3502
02:39:19,420 --> 02:39:20,000
This is safer.

3503
02:39:20,380 --> 02:39:21,800
Use reinforce to call it dead teammates.

3504
02:39:22,020 --> 02:39:23,080
This is safer this way.

3505
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:23,660
Trust me.

3506
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:25,800
Source, trust me.

3507
02:39:26,380 --> 02:39:28,280
I'm carrying you in my pocket like a Pokemon.

3508
02:39:29,680 --> 02:39:31,900
I'm carrying you in my pocket like a little Pokemon.

3509
02:39:32,260 --> 02:39:32,860
Trust me.

3510
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:35,660
I was caught illegally.

3511
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:39,200
I was taken against my will.

3512
02:39:40,660 --> 02:39:41,060
No!

3513
02:39:42,780 --> 02:39:43,420
Oh, no.

3514
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:44,200
I'm in the water.

3515
02:39:44,400 --> 02:39:44,660
I'm in the water.

3516
02:39:44,660 --> 02:39:45,800
She used a master ball.

3517
02:39:45,940 --> 02:39:46,920
I didn't even have a choice.

3518
02:39:47,480 --> 02:39:49,160
I am drowning under the water.

3519
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:52,620
You can't die.

3520
02:39:52,700 --> 02:39:53,640
You have to res me.

3521
02:39:54,760 --> 02:39:55,960
Oh, she already resed you, didn't she?

3522
02:39:56,200 --> 02:39:57,500
No, I'm still not.

3523
02:39:58,440 --> 02:39:58,840
I was...

3524
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:06,580
I was waiting for it to be safer.

3525
02:40:06,780 --> 02:40:08,120
Like, what is it gonna be?

3526
02:40:08,140 --> 02:40:10,240
I thought they resummoned you.

3527
02:40:12,620 --> 02:40:14,840
Be careful, they will be coming soon.

3528
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:15,560
Nice!

3529
02:40:17,480 --> 02:40:19,300
Oh, there they are.

3530
02:40:20,200 --> 02:40:21,480
I killed something.

3531
02:40:21,480 --> 02:40:22,360
Wait, so...

3532
02:40:23,060 --> 02:40:24,480
Wait, why are you gonna use a control?

3533
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:25,740
There we go!

3534
02:40:25,880 --> 02:40:27,100
Yeah, there's a lot of bugs here.

3535
02:40:27,220 --> 02:40:27,840
We need to... Oh, shit!

3536
02:40:28,120 --> 02:40:28,660
Oh, good one!

3537
02:40:30,500 --> 02:40:32,080
Wait, why can't you use a control?

3538
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:34,220
Batara from Fy Shoujo, did you kill?

3539
02:40:35,100 --> 02:40:38,460
No, she launched the rocket onto herself.

3540
02:40:38,660 --> 02:40:39,260
Oh my.

3541
02:40:40,040 --> 02:40:41,220
Hey, did you see this shit?

3542
02:40:42,080 --> 02:40:42,660
What happened?

3543
02:40:42,700 --> 02:40:43,200
I didn't.

3544
02:40:45,660 --> 02:40:46,940
Run from the laser.

3545
02:40:49,400 --> 02:40:50,680
Run from the laser.

3546
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:51,120
Run from the laser.

3547
02:40:51,160 --> 02:40:52,900
I don't know what the laser is, but I'm running.

3548
02:40:53,240 --> 02:40:54,120
You can see it.

3549
02:40:54,260 --> 02:40:55,340
If you look back, you'll see it.

3550
02:40:55,460 --> 02:40:55,920
You'll know.

3551
02:40:58,780 --> 02:41:00,340
Wait, can you guys use the command?

3552
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:02,820
Or do I like reach the blind stuff?

3553
02:41:03,020 --> 02:41:03,180

02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:19,040
There's a guy in front.

3573
02:42:19,740 --> 02:42:20,120
It's okay.

3574
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:21,100
There's a guy behind, too.

3575
02:42:22,400 --> 02:42:22,840
Careful, Mim.

3576
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:23,780
There's a guy behind you.

3577
02:42:29,240 --> 02:42:32,940
See, like, sometimes it's easy and then you get into a
difficulty and you're like, oh my God.

3578
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:34,000
Oh, my God.

3579
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:35,520
Okay.

3580
02:42:36,100 --> 02:42:36,880
That blew up, yes.

3581
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:37,400
Okay.

3582
02:42:37,620 --> 02:42:38,320
Now for the other ones.

3583
02:42:38,820 --> 02:42:40,980
These little white ones that you usually cannot run.

3584
02:42:41,620 --> 02:42:42,420
Oh, they're fast, yeah.

3585
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:44,960
If they're in a group, yeah, they'll jump on you and stagger
you.

3586
02:42:45,800 --> 02:42:46,320
Oh, shoot.

3587
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:49,200
But the rest of them, you can outrun them.

3588
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:52,080
Oh my god, reloading is gonna kill me.

3589
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:57,500
How you like the taste of freedom?

3590
02:42:57,780 --> 02:42:58,540
How you like that?

3591
02:42:58,540 --> 02:42:59,920
It tastes like mint, I think.

3592
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:02,080
What, freedom tastes like mint?

3593
02:43:02,900 --> 02:43:03,240
Yeah.

3594
02:43:04,220 --> 02:43:04,960
And toothpaste.

3595
02:43:05,720 --> 02:43:06,140
And toothpaste.

3596
02:43:06,180 --> 02:43:07,820
To the best!

3597
02:43:09,900 --> 02:43:10,780
For prosperity!

3598
02:43:11,180 --> 02:43:12,180
Uh oh.

3599
02:43:14,440 --> 02:43:16,300
Prosperity awaits in the care of magnets.

3600
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:19,340
What the?

3601
02:43:19,420 --> 02:43:21,540
Did you not read the company policy?

3602
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:22,000
Thank you, Daya!

3603
02:43:22,300 --> 02:43:22,980
I didn't know!

3604
02:43:25,360 --> 02:43:29,000
Oh, I just threw something and I'm not sure what.

3605
02:43:29,460 --> 02:43:29,960
Don't worry, Hendy.

3606
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:30,980
I got you back.

3607
02:43:31,640 --> 02:43:33,540
I think I know what you just threw.

3608
02:43:33,620 --> 02:43:34,560
I don't think that was me.

3609
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:37,100
I don't think so.

3610
02:43:37,160 --> 02:43:37,740
Hold on.

3611
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:38,340
Samples.

3612
02:43:38,940 --> 02:43:39,340
Samples.

3613
02:43:40,720 --> 02:43:41,120
Democracy.

3614
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:41,800
Oh, let's go.

3615
02:43:42,440 --> 02:43:42,840
Nice.

3616
02:43:43,060 --> 02:43:45,440
You have, um, oh, I'll just use this gun.

3617
02:43:45,780 --> 02:43:46,520
Let's go, why.

3618
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:49,320
Keter, Keter, Keter.

3619
02:43:50,200 --> 02:43:50,600
Keter.

3620
02:43:51,440 --> 02:43:53,360
I'm gonna, should we go towards them?

3621
02:43:53,800 --> 02:43:54,520
Yeah, go towards them.

3622
02:43:54,560 --> 02:43:56,280
I'm just gonna kill this guy so he doesn't follow us.

3623
02:43:56,400 --> 02:43:57,480
Oh, oh, okay.

3624
02:43:57,620 --> 02:43:58,680
Oh, I got this suddenly.

3625
02:43:59,260 --> 02:43:59,300
I'm running.

3626
02:43:59,300 --> 02:43:59,860
Oh, wait, hold on.

3627
02:44:00,480 --> 02:44:01,520
I'll let you know when it beeps.

3628
02:44:01,640 --> 02:44:02,540
I'm running.

3629
02:44:04,200 --> 02:44:05,120
Running, running.

3630
02:44:05,500 --> 02:44:05,860
Oh, careful.

3631
02:44:06,180 --> 02:44:07,600
to your left are bugs.

3632
02:44:07,620 --> 02:44:07,780
Stop!

3633
02:44:09,700 --> 02:44:10,540
Is that good?

3634
02:44:10,960 --> 02:44:13,320
Yeah, if you heard the beep sound, it means that it's
aligned.

3635
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:14,760
Maybe they're at your other left?

3636
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:15,520
Yeah.

3637
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:16,880
I'm killing some.

3638
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:17,820
Go back, back, back, back, back, back, back.

3639
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:19,240
Stop.

3640
02:44:19,660 --> 02:44:19,720
Okay.

3641
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:25,080
Yeah, so getting a lot of chargers is hard when you don't
have like the items to kill them.

3642
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:28,940
So, Henny, there's like a distinct beep sound coming from
the terminal that lets you know that, um, you aligned it

3643
02:44:28,940 --> 02:44:29,300
perfectly.

3644
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:30,520
Oh, really?

3645
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:33,880
Yeah, so that's why sometimes it's easy to do this on your
own if you can.

3646
02:44:33,960 --> 02:44:34,840
Here they come.

3647
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:52,280
watching the war how about refill that's empty yeah all
right girls i will awaken the beast within the beast i will

3648

He's throwing up.

3653
02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:11,740
We're in the middle of two.

3654
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:13,460
We're in the middle of two bug breaches.

3655
02:45:14,120 --> 02:45:14,480
Uh-oh.

3656
02:45:15,060 --> 02:45:15,460
Yeah.

3657
02:45:16,020 --> 02:45:17,440
So we got to go back towards them.

3658
02:45:17,520 --> 02:45:18,400
Or yeah, you're towards them.

3659
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:18,600
Perfect.

3660
02:45:19,080 --> 02:45:20,340
I was in the middle of the bug breach.

3661
02:45:20,560 --> 02:45:21,640
Nick was doing great.

3662
02:45:23,480 --> 02:45:23,880
No!

3663
02:45:24,920 --> 02:45:25,720
I got you, Hena.

3664
02:45:26,580 --> 02:45:27,480
I got you.

3665
02:45:28,800 --> 02:45:30,080
No, I got her.

3666
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:30,860
I got her.

3667
02:45:31,260 --> 02:45:31,460
Throw.

3668
02:45:31,700 --> 02:45:32,420
I got her.

3669
02:45:33,100 --> 02:45:37,500
Oh god, I sorry, I put you in a pretty bad spot.

3670
02:45:37,500 --> 02:45:38,320
I'm okay.

3671
02:45:39,080 --> 02:45:40,460
Wait, that didn't kill?

3672
02:45:41,800 --> 02:45:43,060
I almost have him killed.

3673
02:45:43,180 --> 02:45:45,540
I just need to do one more Kusarkan and he's dead.

3674
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:47,760
I need ammo!

3675
02:45:49,340 --> 02:45:50,360
There we go.

3676
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:50,960
Good job!

3677
02:45:51,500 --> 02:45:52,100
Beautifully died.

3678
02:45:52,640 --> 02:45:53,280
I still can't.

3679
02:45:53,400 --> 02:45:55,780
I don't think I shot him even my Haruka from Bishojo.

3680
02:45:56,380 --> 02:45:57,760
That's my gamer girl.

3681
02:45:58,480 --> 02:45:59,820
That's my Canadian moose.

3682
02:46:00,640 --> 02:46:01,000

3686
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:49,240

02:47:04,460 --> 02:47:05,460
Why do you need to know?

3690
02:47:06,180 --> 02:47:06,520
It's my skill.

3691
02:47:06,520 --> 02:47:07,540
So what are you trying to do?

3692
02:47:07,540 --> 02:47:08,900
How are you trying to open up your stratagem, Senya?

3693
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:11,280
If I walked into it, it was going to kill me.

3694
02:47:11,280 --> 02:47:11,860
So what are you trying to do?

3695
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:12,880
I'm looking at your stream now.

3696
02:47:13,100 --> 02:47:14,040
Are you trying to open your...

3697
02:47:14,040 --> 02:47:14,740
Oh, I'm trying to...

3698
02:47:14,740 --> 02:47:16,580
I'm pressing the control right now, but it doesn't see...

3699
02:47:16,980 --> 02:47:19,100
Like, usually they show me the like a stuff, right?

3700
02:47:19,160 --> 02:47:19,840
The arrow stuff.

3701
02:47:20,240 --> 02:47:21,260
But I can't see it.

3702
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:21,320
Rare sample.

3703
02:47:22,100 --> 02:47:22,740
Rare sample.

3704
02:47:22,940 --> 02:47:23,000
Oh.

3705
02:47:23,820 --> 02:47:23,940
No.

3706
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:24,880
I'm gonna turn around.

3707
02:47:25,060 --> 02:47:25,380
Oh, that is weird.

3708
02:47:25,560 --> 02:47:26,020
I think I was okay.

3709
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:26,680
No, we got him.

3710
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:27,080
We got him.

3711
02:47:28,460 --> 02:47:28,780
Okay.

3712
02:47:28,780 --> 02:47:29,840
Maybe over there's a bait.

3713
02:47:30,020 --> 02:47:31,100
I can get him with this gun.

3714
02:47:34,460 --> 02:47:36,520
I think you'll be fine if we leave this mission maybe.

3715
02:47:37,260 --> 02:47:38,620
Yeah, yeah, I think that's it.

3716
02:47:38,640 --> 02:47:38,960
Yeah, he said!

3717
02:47:39,840 --> 02:47:40,360
This mission.

3718
02:47:40,540 --> 02:47:40,860
Oh, nice.

3719
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:41,580
Good job.

3720
02:47:42,060 --> 02:47:42,760
I didn't do anything.

3721
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:43,320
You're bait.

3722
02:47:43,620 --> 02:47:44,420
I know, I know.

3723
02:47:44,420 --> 02:47:45,140
But you still helped.

3724
02:47:45,280 --> 02:47:45,800
You were the bait.

3725
02:47:45,860 --> 02:47:46,520
We're gonna survive.

3726
02:47:46,680 --> 02:47:48,080
We had a very important job.

3727
02:47:48,440 --> 02:47:48,860
That's true.

3728
02:47:49,300 --> 02:47:50,940
I was delicious.

3729
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:52,200
Minty freshness.

3730
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:53,400
Over here.

3731
02:47:53,520 --> 02:47:54,300
You want a little bite of a...

3732
02:47:54,300 --> 02:47:55,240
Oh, geez, you mind?

3733
02:47:55,300 --> 02:47:55,880
Maybe that'll work.

3734
02:47:56,180 --> 02:47:56,800
Minty girl.

3735
02:47:57,500 --> 02:47:58,060
Minty girl.

3736
02:47:58,900 --> 02:48:00,620
Hey there, big bug.

3737
02:48:01,560 --> 02:48:02,880
You want a little bite?

3738
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:04,440
What's this?

3739
02:48:04,460 --> 02:48:06,500
Can I open it?

3740
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:07,900
There's a chair.

3741
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:09,480
Anyone want to sit?

3742
02:48:10,180 --> 02:48:10,840
You can try.

3743
02:48:12,320 --> 02:48:13,080
I got you.

3744
02:48:13,240 --> 02:48:13,740
It ain't working.

3745
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:14,480
It ain't working.

3746
02:48:15,060 --> 02:48:15,200
I'm trying.

3747
02:48:16,280 --> 02:48:17,120
She did it.

3748
02:48:17,160 --> 02:48:18,140
She fixed your problems.

3749
02:48:19,360 --> 02:48:19,800
I love her.

3750
02:48:20,040 --> 02:48:21,140
I probably should reload.

3751
02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:25,120
And...

3752
02:48:25,120 --> 02:48:25,320
What?

3753
02:48:26,340 --> 02:48:27,240
Are you going to kill us then?

3754
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:29,960
I'm talking to the little guys.

3755
02:48:30,460 --> 02:48:33,860
Wait, I thought we were bumping over this democracy thing.

3777
02:50:33,520 --> 02:50:34,740
She stopped stopping recently, okay?

3778
02:50:34,960 --> 02:50:37,060
She's trying to get her everything back.

3779
02:50:38,560 --> 02:50:39,600
Everything's getting back.

3780
02:50:39,700 --> 02:50:40,360
I miss out.

3781
02:50:40,720 --> 02:50:43,140
I can't even get my stuff back because you killed me.

3782

02:52:08,140 --> 02:52:08,640
Okay, got it.

3823
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:09,720
It's better than nothing.

3824
02:52:10,260 --> 02:52:11,400
Fuck my bitch!

3825
02:52:11,720 --> 02:52:13,480
Where the fuck are you?

3826
02:52:13,940 --> 02:52:15,380
All right, let's go towards them then.

3827
02:52:15,540 --> 02:52:15,900
Okay.

3828
02:52:16,140 --> 02:52:17,280
Actually, no, this is where we evacuate.

3829
02:52:17,960 --> 02:52:18,380
Oh, yeah, no.

3830
02:52:18,600 --> 02:52:19,200
Let's go towards them.

3831
02:52:19,240 --> 02:52:20,020
That's where we just run.

3832
02:52:20,060 --> 02:52:21,020
Why am I so slow?

3833
02:52:21,460 --> 02:52:22,300
Why am I so slow?

3834
02:52:23,480 --> 02:52:24,180
They're too tall.

3835
02:52:24,540 --> 02:52:25,320
I think I'm going to die.

3836
02:52:25,480 --> 02:52:27,160
I think I'm going to...

3837
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:27,460
Just run.

3838
02:52:27,580 --> 02:52:27,720
Just run.

3839
02:52:27,900 --> 02:52:28,040
Just run.

3840
02:52:28,460 --> 02:52:28,820
I'm...

3841
02:52:28,820 --> 02:52:29,440
I am.

3842
02:52:29,560 --> 02:52:30,720
I'm doing the best that I...

3843
02:52:30,720 --> 02:52:30,840
Oh.

3844
02:52:33,020 --> 02:52:34,060
I'm going to make that good.

3845
02:52:34,620 --> 02:52:35,280
I'm going to get closer than this.

3846
02:52:39,860 --> 02:52:43,000
Hey, hey, hey, get out of my back.

3847
02:52:44,200 --> 02:52:46,520
Oh, it's the little, a white one's done.

3848
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:48,760
There are so many of us, oh my gosh.

3849
02:52:50,700 --> 02:52:51,080
I am.

3850
02:52:51,320 --> 02:52:52,720
Minx can come to us closer now.

3851
02:52:52,820 --> 02:52:54,260
I had no more stems, you guys.

3852
02:52:54,380 --> 02:52:55,240
I had no more stems.

3853
02:52:55,460 --> 02:52:56,280
Run, run to them.

3854
02:52:56,440 --> 02:52:57,880
I'm gonna, I'm gonna clear the little box here.

3855
02:52:57,880 --> 02:52:58,480
No, I'm, I'm dead.

3856
02:52:58,720 --> 02:52:59,420
Oh, oh, okay.

3857
02:53:00,120 --> 02:53:01,200
No, no, fuck up.

3858
02:53:01,240 --> 02:53:02,280
The ship is down all right.

3859
02:53:02,400 --> 02:53:03,720
We're waiting for everyone to come here.

3860
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:04,560
Yeah, we're waiting for E, you guys.

3861
02:53:04,680 --> 02:53:06,120
Well, yeah, we're trying.

3862
02:53:06,280 --> 02:53:07,800
We were having fun doing bugs.

3863
02:53:08,040 --> 02:53:09,860
Why is it getting so low here?

3864
02:53:11,740 --> 02:53:12,820
Oh, this is water.

3865
02:53:12,940 --> 02:53:13,560
This is water.

3866
02:53:13,560 --> 02:53:14,040
No, go!

3867
02:53:25,580 --> 02:53:31,340
I think we're doing a really good job, right, Mata?

3868
02:53:31,800 --> 02:53:33,240
I think we are too, yeah.

3869
02:53:33,680 --> 02:53:34,080
We're gaming.

3870
02:53:35,100 --> 02:53:36,020
And then to the left?

3871
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:36,840
Oh, to the left.

3872
02:53:37,080 --> 02:53:38,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, my God.

3873
02:53:38,940 --> 02:53:40,140
Was that you?

3874
02:53:40,980 --> 02:53:41,380
No.

3875
02:53:41,700 --> 02:53:43,440
Guys, you should summon her next to you.

3876
02:53:43,560 --> 02:53:45,360
Summon her where you are.

3877
02:53:45,540 --> 02:53:46,520
And I'll run.

3878
02:53:47,360 --> 02:53:48,100
Cut my head off.

3879
02:53:48,280 --> 02:53:52,320
Cut my head into faces.

3880
02:53:53,280 --> 02:53:53,920
I can't read it.

3881
02:53:55,280 --> 02:53:58,180
Yeah, I think she meant the other left, you guys.

3882
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:02,280
Here we go.

3883
02:54:02,420 --> 02:54:03,040
I'm coming.

3884
02:54:03,260 --> 02:54:03,500
I'm coming.

3885
02:54:04,460 --> 02:54:05,540
Wait for me.

3886
02:54:08,520 --> 02:54:10,980
Why don't you guys just get in the car?

3887
02:54:11,620 --> 02:54:12,060
Get inside.

3888
02:54:12,060 --> 02:54:13,040
No, no, because then it'll leave.

3889
02:54:13,660 --> 02:54:14,020
No!

3890
02:54:15,920 --> 02:54:16,280
Oh!

3891
02:54:18,200 --> 02:54:18,920
Now you guys can leave.

3892
02:54:19,080 --> 02:54:19,280
It just...

3893
02:54:19,280 --> 02:54:20,800
I think it like lowers our experience.

3894
02:54:20,960 --> 02:54:21,120
Oh!

3895
02:54:23,300 --> 02:54:25,180
It lowers our experience, but it's not.

3896
02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:27,480
My samples!

3897
02:54:28,740 --> 02:54:29,420
My samples!

3898
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:31,400
Um...

3899
02:54:31,400 --> 02:54:32,260
Yeah, sorry, Haru.

3900
02:54:32,600 --> 02:54:33,760
Sometimes, like, I get...

3901
02:54:33,800 --> 02:54:36,040
I just start killing the bugs and not looking at the
mission.

3902
02:54:36,180 --> 02:54:36,700
I'm reloaded.

3903
02:54:36,700 --> 02:54:38,880
So you guys should have just been like, oh guys, we're at
the end.

3904
02:54:39,020 --> 02:54:40,460
We're doing the...

3905
02:54:40,460 --> 02:54:41,740
Because we were just having fun.

3906
02:54:43,460 --> 02:54:46,240
Do you see why I invited Haruka to this collab?

3907
02:54:46,480 --> 02:54:48,340
Because she actually gets the shit done.

3908
02:54:49,740 --> 02:54:51,440
Wait, it bugged?

3909
02:54:51,680 --> 02:54:52,640
Wait, some people say you died.

3910
02:54:53,800 --> 02:54:54,440
It didn't bug.

3911
02:54:54,660 --> 02:54:58,020
No, no, Kenya had the stratagem glitch so she couldn't put
down any stratagems.

3912
02:54:58,120 --> 02:55:00,200
Oh, yeah, wait, did she make sure that...

3913
02:55:00,200 --> 02:55:01,160
Oh, I made it!

3914
02:55:01,340 --> 02:55:01,660
Yippee!

3915
02:55:02,120 --> 02:55:02,960
Wait, why did I...

3916
02:55:02,960 --> 02:55:03,980
How are you the only one?

3917
02:55:04,020 --> 02:55:04,520
I don't know.

3918
02:55:05,360 --> 02:55:05,580
Huh?

3919
02:55:06,360 --> 02:55:07,440
I left them behind.

3920
02:55:08,460 --> 02:55:08,840
Did you actually run into the ship?

3921
02:55:08,840 --> 02:55:10,000
Did you actually run into the ship?

3922
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:11,720
Maybe on accident, but I don't...

3923
02:55:11,740 --> 02:55:12,660
Oh no!

3924
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:14,200
Minx.

3925
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:15,900
Honestly, pretty bait!

3926
02:55:16,380 --> 02:55:17,400
Shake in my head!

3927
02:55:18,160 --> 02:55:20,780
Wait, this is my first time playing this game, okay?

3928
02:55:21,540 --> 02:55:22,680
Shake in my head.

3929
02:55:23,220 --> 02:55:24,680
Oh, the ship got damaged.

3930
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:26,360
The shuttle extraction bug?

3931
02:55:27,560 --> 02:55:30,880
Oh, wait, if the ship get damaged, they will start the ship?

3932
02:55:31,340 --> 02:55:34,740
I think I was trying to get away from a bug and I dove into
the ship.

3933
02:55:35,520 --> 02:55:36,520
I'm like, pretty bait!

3934
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:39,040
Dun dun dun!

3935
02:55:41,740 --> 02:55:42,160
Yippee!

3936
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:43,220
I cannot believe it, Min.

3937
02:55:43,440 --> 02:55:44,740
You ruined everything.

3938
02:55:44,960 --> 02:55:45,860
I got to the ship!

3939
02:55:46,140 --> 02:55:47,080
I made it alive!

3940
02:55:48,260 --> 02:55:48,600
Out clean!

3941
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:49,900
Oh boy!

3942
02:55:51,700 --> 02:55:53,160
I did it.

3943
02:55:53,420 --> 02:55:54,700
Everything I ever worked for.

3944
02:55:55,360 --> 02:55:58,640
How the fuck did Matara Khan do not die a single time?

3945
02:55:58,820 --> 02:55:59,220
That's crazy.

3946
02:55:59,640 --> 02:56:00,540
Yo, it's called gaming.

3947
02:56:01,320 --> 02:56:02,440
You didn't die a single time?

3948
02:56:02,660 --> 02:56:04,420
Bada bam, bada bing, bada boom.

3949
02:56:04,720 --> 02:56:05,360
Bada boom.

3950
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:06,760
Bada boom.

3951
02:56:06,760 --> 02:56:09,220
Bada bing, bada boom, bada, bada, bada, bada, bada.

3952
02:56:09,800 --> 02:56:10,640
Yes, Henya.

3953
02:56:10,780 --> 02:56:11,300
Learn these phrases.

3954
02:56:11,300 --> 02:56:13,540
You're not supposed to have capes.

3955
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:16,900
Um, we are...

3956
02:56:16,900 --> 02:56:17,680
Hell divers?

3957
02:56:18,140 --> 02:56:19,980
It's a requirement to have a cape.

3958
02:56:20,640 --> 02:56:21,140
I'm sorry, yeah.

3959
02:56:22,040 --> 02:56:23,920
I just thought that we're superheroes.

3960
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:25,440
We're not supposed to have a cape.

3961
02:56:26,060 --> 02:56:29,680
Listen, Finn, not wearing a cape is the most least
democratic thing we can do.

3962
02:56:30,580 --> 02:56:31,500
Oh, true, true, true.

3963
02:56:33,080 --> 02:56:33,560
It's...

3964
02:56:33,560 --> 02:56:34,380
True, true, true.

3965
02:56:34,980 --> 02:56:35,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3966
02:56:36,900 --> 02:56:38,720
Are we not superheroes, you guys?

3967
02:56:38,820 --> 02:56:45,320
It's a superhero rule, but are we not superheroes we are

Bada, bam, bing, bing, bing, bing.

3975
02:57:13,660 --> 02:57:17,860
So she said that, are we not superheroes because we're

3976
02:57:18,040 --> 02:57:18,580
Because we have kids?

3977
02:57:18,740 --> 02:57:19,540
Are we not superheroes?

3978
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:21,140
That's basically what she said.

3979
02:57:21,380 --> 02:57:21,560
Yeah.

3980
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:22,460

Yeah.

3983
02:57:30,120 --> 02:57:32,060
I think we're going crazy.

3984
02:57:32,140 --> 02:57:33,160
I think so too.

3985
02:57:33,400 --> 02:57:34,800
I don't know what's happening anymore.

3986
02:57:37,840 --> 02:57:38,020
Yeah.

3987
02:57:38,780 --> 02:57:40,140
I blame him, yeah.

3988
02:57:40,620 --> 02:57:42,480
I'm speaking my truth.

3989
02:57:43,880 --> 02:57:44,500
It's a truth, Queen.

3990
02:57:45,260 --> 02:57:46,720
Say it from your chest.

3991
02:57:48,920 --> 02:57:50,720
What is it wrong with your head?

3992
02:57:52,820 --> 02:57:54,260
Stay with your balls, man.

02:57:54,520 --> 02:57:55,560

season.

4001
02:58:25,940 --> 02:58:27,120
Guys, I'm gonna rejoin the game.

4002

is better than the first one, really.

03:00:15,080 --> 03:00:15,520
It's a plane.

4033
03:00:15,680 --> 03:00:16,120

can do.

4066
03:01:42,530 --> 03:01:43,390
My ear's bleeding.

4067
03:01:46,430 --> 03:01:48,630
From the Joker, the one.

4068
03:01:50,210 --> 03:01:52,250
It's a gift, Hanya, for me to you.

4069

Thank you for the gift, Dave.

4070
03:01:57,410 --> 03:01:57,630

Oh my gosh.

4073

Freedom never sleeps!

4074
03:02:02,510 --> 03:02:07,230
Sorry, I did not mean to say shit on your stream, but fuck,
I am about to die.

4075
03:02:07,670 --> 03:02:08,310
That's okay.

4076
03:02:09,470 --> 03:02:10,170
That's okay.

4077
03:02:11,050 --> 03:02:14,170
I say, I accidentally say bad things too sometimes.

4078
03:02:15,390 --> 03:02:17,050
Mint casually writes this in her nose.

4079
03:02:17,270 --> 03:02:22,250
Harka is about to breathe her last breath today.

4080
03:02:23,790 --> 03:02:24,450
Oh shit.

4081
03:02:25,210 --> 03:02:26,610
Oh, I see I said it too on accident.

4082
03:02:26,670 --> 03:02:26,810
Rights mean the death note.

4083
03:02:28,610 --> 03:02:30,770
Oh, I'm out of ammo on everything.

4084
03:02:30,970 --> 03:02:31,690
Those words?

4085
03:02:32,290 --> 03:02:32,750
It's okay, Mint.

4086
03:02:32,850 --> 03:02:33,370

4087
03:02:33,590 --> 03:02:33,930

03:04:16,280 --> 03:04:16,460
Oh.

4125
03:04:17,340 --> 03:04:19,860
You have to call in a hell bomb near the gray building.

4126
03:04:20,100 --> 03:04:22,820
You sent us on a wild goose chase.

4127

Oh, I had to punch in the code in the hell bomb.

4138

Fudge.

03:05:07,880 --> 03:05:08,660
Okay, I'm sorry, Mint.

4140
03:05:08,740 --> 03:05:10,860
This is why I brought Haruka, because I don't know how to do
anything.

4141
03:05:11,700 --> 03:05:12,400
Yeah, I could tell.

4142
03:05:15,460 --> 03:05:16,300
Where's the bomb?

4143
03:05:16,500 --> 03:05:18,460
So, you have to go back inside and...

4144
03:05:18,460 --> 03:05:21,100
Yeah, I think I have to, like, activate the code on it.

4145
03:05:21,160 --> 03:05:21,760
Oh, Hanna, be careful.

4146
03:05:21,980 --> 03:05:22,480
I'm going to throw it.

4147
03:05:22,540 --> 03:05:23,300
I'm going to throw it.

4148
03:05:23,620 --> 03:05:23,820
Okay.

4149
03:05:24,420 --> 03:05:25,080
I'm running out of here.

4150
03:05:25,380 --> 03:05:28,380
I just have to find where I put it.

4151
03:05:29,480 --> 03:05:30,400
Where did I...

4152
03:05:30,400 --> 03:05:31,960
Guys, do you know where I summoned mom?

4153
03:05:32,020 --> 03:05:33,980
I'm gonna run the other way.

4154
03:05:33,980 --> 03:05:34,260
Woo!

4155
03:05:35,440 --> 03:05:36,300

03:05:37,100 --> 03:05:37,340
It's okay.

4158
03:05:37,520 --> 03:05:38,020
They broke it?

4159
03:05:38,980 --> 03:05:39,360
Okay.

4160
03:05:39,400 --> 03:05:39,840

4165
03:05:47,940 --> 03:05:49,200
I think we should do that.

4166
03:05:50,180 --> 03:05:50,900
Nice, we did it.

4167
03:05:50,900 --> 03:05:52,620
There's a bug nest here if you want to do it.

4168
03:05:52,760 --> 03:05:53,600
Nice teamwork.

4169
03:05:53,720 --> 03:05:55,360
I don't want to do anything with you.

4170
03:05:56,140 --> 03:05:57,200
Oh my god!

4171
03:05:57,480 --> 03:05:58,460
Oh my god!

4172
03:05:58,460 --> 03:06:02,040
The Russians are really broken and I'm not there to win his
game.

4173
03:06:02,100 --> 03:06:02,640
What the fuck?

4174
03:06:06,840 --> 03:06:07,720
Let's go.

4175
03:06:09,160 --> 03:06:11,720
Here, I'm going to refill my supply pack.

4176
03:06:12,900 --> 03:06:13,020
Nice.

4177
03:06:13,500 --> 03:06:14,720
Don't be anywhere near the bomb.

4178
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:16,180
Oh, you put the bomb?

4179
03:06:16,780 --> 03:06:17,140
Yeah.

4180
03:06:18,960 --> 03:06:20,800
I put the bomb all right.

4181
03:06:21,280 --> 03:06:21,460
Oh.

4182
03:06:22,520 --> 03:06:22,960
Yippee!

4183
03:06:23,080 --> 03:06:23,640
Oh, my God.

4184
03:06:23,700 --> 03:06:24,420
There's a corner right there.

4185
03:06:24,680 --> 03:06:25,800
That is actually really fun.

4186
03:06:26,060 --> 03:06:26,360
Oh, here.

4187
03:06:26,640 --> 03:06:27,720
I'm here by the bug mask.

4188
03:06:28,900 --> 03:06:29,520
Oh, fuck.

4189
03:06:29,700 --> 03:06:30,360
Oh, wait.

4190
03:06:34,760 --> 03:06:35,700
I love you.

4191
03:06:36,660 --> 03:06:37,460
Not today.

4192
03:06:37,840 --> 03:06:39,220
I'm sorry, but you got to be careful.

4193
03:06:39,540 --> 03:06:40,040
What did I?

4194
03:06:40,100 --> 03:06:40,860
What did I miss?

4195
03:06:41,100 --> 03:06:42,440
What is it that I missed?

4196
03:06:44,060 --> 03:06:44,860
I'm sorry.

4197
03:06:44,960 --> 03:06:46,540
I didn't realize you were very close to me.

4198
03:06:46,740 --> 03:06:49,600
So I had summoned like my rock.

4199
03:06:49,960 --> 03:06:53,920
I was trying to kill the nest with my rock.

4200
03:06:54,380 --> 03:06:55,160
Let me give you a shield.

4201
03:06:55,260 --> 03:06:56,240
It's going to help.

4202
03:06:56,240 --> 03:06:56,380
No.

4203
03:06:59,020 --> 03:06:59,680
I'm sorry.

4204
03:07:07,500 --> 03:07:08,840
Where is the nest?

4205
03:07:09,060 --> 03:07:09,640
Oh, she didn't summon me.

4206
03:07:10,800 --> 03:07:11,620
We just...

4207
03:07:11,620 --> 03:07:12,120
I killed it.

4208
03:07:12,180 --> 03:07:12,580
Oh, okay.

4209
03:07:12,680 --> 03:07:13,760
What the fuck now?

4210
03:07:15,400 --> 03:07:15,720
Oh, shit.

4211
03:07:15,860 --> 03:07:16,140
You're fucked.

4212
03:07:16,160 --> 03:07:17,120
Let's go towards...

4213
03:07:17,120 --> 03:07:18,580
Big red laser equals splat.

4214
03:07:18,740 --> 03:07:20,360
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

4215
03:07:20,480 --> 03:07:22,840
Yeah, when the big red laser comes, it means like...

4216
03:07:22,840 --> 03:07:24,160
Oh, okay.

4217
03:07:26,480 --> 03:07:28,580
Okay, so the red beacon is...

4218
03:07:28,580 --> 03:07:28,920
Okay.

4219
03:07:29,160 --> 03:07:29,960
I got you.

4220
03:07:30,040 --> 03:07:30,380
I got you.

4221
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:32,180
The red is mad.

4222
03:07:32,500 --> 03:07:33,120
I got it.

4223
03:07:33,140 --> 03:07:34,940
Uh-oh.

4224
03:07:35,540 --> 03:07:37,440
Guys, I'll resummon you, but we're pretty far.

4225
03:07:37,720 --> 03:07:38,200
No, no, no, no, no.

4226
03:07:38,200 --> 03:07:38,860
I can summon my back.

4227
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:39,200
It's okay.

4228
03:07:39,420 --> 03:07:39,620
Okay.

4229
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:40,520
I got this.

4230
03:07:40,580 --> 03:07:41,120
I just got it.

4231
03:07:41,360 --> 03:07:41,820
Thank you.

4232
03:07:41,900 --> 03:07:42,880
I'm here now.

4233
03:07:43,580 --> 03:07:44,460
You got this hide.

4234
03:07:44,480 --> 03:07:45,380
I believe in you.

4235
03:07:45,600 --> 03:07:46,360
We're here.

4236
03:07:46,960 --> 03:07:47,020
Nice.

4237
03:07:47,020 --> 03:07:47,740
Close-ish.

4238
03:07:47,880 --> 03:07:49,140
Oh, we're kind of close.

4239
03:07:49,260 --> 03:07:50,640
We're pretty far, but it's fine.

4240
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:51,960
No, I can see them fighting.

4241
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:53,560
Thank you.

4242
03:07:54,480 --> 03:07:55,740
The girls are fighting.

4243
03:07:56,140 --> 03:07:57,200
The girls aren't fighting.

4244
03:07:58,180 --> 03:07:59,940
The bitches are shitting.

4245
03:08:01,640 --> 03:08:02,180
Oh, yeah.

4246
03:08:02,340 --> 03:08:03,160
Have you ever heard of that one?

4247
03:08:03,300 --> 03:08:05,060
Are you a girl that poops or a bitch that shit?

4248
03:08:05,320 --> 03:08:06,220
Are you a bitch that shit?

4249
03:08:06,440 --> 03:08:08,860
It's like, are you a girl failure or a girl boss kind of
vibe?

4250
03:08:09,040 --> 03:08:09,200
Oh.

4251
03:08:09,440 --> 03:08:10,400
I am a bitch that shit.

4252
03:08:10,520 --> 03:08:14,780
I think I'm a girl boss, but my chat thinks I think is a
girl failure.

4253
03:08:15,400 --> 03:08:16,080
You know what?

4254
03:08:16,280 --> 03:08:18,280
I'm inclined to agree to an extent.

4255
03:08:18,500 --> 03:08:19,420
I think you're a little girl failure.

4256
03:08:19,960 --> 03:08:20,980
What do you mean by that?

4257
03:08:21,060 --> 03:08:22,060
How do you mean by that?

4258
03:08:22,700 --> 03:08:23,520
Yeah, how do you come?

4259
03:08:23,900 --> 03:08:24,420
What do you mean by that?

4260
03:08:25,120 --> 03:08:26,340
These look kind of suggestive.

4261
03:08:26,560 --> 03:08:29,820
I think someone should hold your hand sometimes.

4262
03:08:31,080 --> 03:08:33,100
I think she wants to hold your hand, man.

4263
03:08:33,140 --> 03:08:34,880
I want to hold you.

4264
03:08:36,480 --> 03:08:39,540
I want to hold you.

4265
03:08:39,920 --> 03:08:40,500
Here's a refill.

4266
03:08:41,500 --> 03:08:42,840
I don't want to be an American.

4267
03:08:45,780 --> 03:08:46,120
Thank you.

4268
03:08:46,120 --> 03:08:46,440

4272
03:08:54,600 --> 03:08:54,900

4275
03:08:59,980 --> 03:09:00,540

You're fine.

4284

Oh, there's some guys behind you.

4285
03:09:37,520 --> 03:09:38,060
It's just a flesh wound.

4286

Yeah, I see.

4287
03:09:38,480 --> 03:09:39,500
Let me get the little guys behind.

4288

You just keep running away, girl.

4289
03:09:40,920 --> 03:09:41,240
Oh, okay.

4290
03:09:41,820 --> 03:09:42,820
Oh, there's a bug breed.

4291
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:44,160
You can actually just run to them.

4292
03:09:44,820 --> 03:09:45,240
Okay, Mitt.

4293
03:09:45,720 --> 03:09:45,800

Run to them.

Oh, look at him.

Stealing our fucking integrity and our work and our body's

That means I raised him well.

4523
03:19:47,460 --> 03:19:50,100
You know, they have those pictures of dogs that start
looking like their owners.

4524
03:19:51,060 --> 03:19:51,580
Oh, yeah.

4525
03:19:52,480 --> 03:19:55,840

4526
03:19:56,340 --> 03:19:57,120
Hey, everyone.

4527

It's at the opposite side.

4540
03:20:12,220 --> 03:20:14,260
Oh, you can resummon your stuff at the extraction point.

4541
03:20:14,640 --> 03:20:15,400
Oh, he killed himself.

4542
03:20:15,580 --> 03:20:15,780
That's fine.

4543
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:16,440
Oh, okay, okay.

4544
03:20:16,500 --> 03:20:16,700
You can?

4545
03:20:17,260 --> 03:20:18,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4546
03:20:18,520 --> 03:20:19,760

03:20:25,600 --> 03:20:25,940
Yeah, yeah.

4553
03:20:25,940 --> 03:20:26,620
You can call them again.

4554
03:20:26,780 --> 03:20:30,340
Usually what we do, as soon as you get to the...

4555
03:20:30,900 --> 03:20:34,280
Oh my god, not Heavenly playing Driscoll Rain 2.

4556
03:20:34,560 --> 03:20:36,280
Of course he is.

4557
03:20:36,700 --> 03:20:39,660
Go to the blue and go to the blue.

4558
03:20:40,860 --> 03:20:41,660
My drone!

4559
03:20:43,460 --> 03:20:45,140

03:20:56,400 --> 03:20:57,180
YAMI, yAMI.

4565
03:21:05,660 --> 03:21:06,920
One minute, one minute.

4566
03:21:07,040 --> 03:21:07,520
One minute.

4567
03:21:07,740 --> 03:21:08,220
Doing good.

4568
03:21:08,380 --> 03:21:08,720
Doing good.

4569
03:21:09,400 --> 03:21:10,980
Yeah, it just kind of looks like my cat.

4570
03:21:11,860 --> 03:21:12,680
And he does that.

4571
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:15,820
I cannot wait to be the judge of that.

4572
03:21:16,200 --> 03:21:17,540
That's your cat.

4573
03:21:17,540 --> 03:21:18,380
Like, that's your cat.

4574
03:21:18,720 --> 03:21:19,600
Attack you like that.

4575
03:21:20,320 --> 03:21:20,520
No.

4576
03:21:20,580 --> 03:21:21,060
I'm sure.

4577
03:21:22,540 --> 03:21:23,320
Why not?

4578
03:21:24,140 --> 03:21:24,760
Forkway, no.

4579
03:21:25,540 --> 03:21:26,660
I mean, sometimes.

4580
03:21:26,840 --> 03:21:28,740
I like how you've been saying forkway because of me.

4581
03:21:29,440 --> 03:21:29,880
Forkway?

4582
03:21:30,160 --> 03:21:31,860
I feel like I stole that one from you.

4583
03:21:32,320 --> 03:21:32,600
Yeah.

4584
03:21:32,820 --> 03:21:33,260
Forkway.

4585
03:21:34,160 --> 03:21:34,180
Forkway.

4586
03:21:34,860 --> 03:21:36,520
Jitas de Polo was mine.

4587
03:21:37,120 --> 03:21:38,100
I've had that one.

4588
03:21:38,220 --> 03:21:39,920
That's been mine since forever.

4589
03:21:41,140 --> 03:21:41,900
Oh, uh-oh.

4590
03:21:42,260 --> 03:21:42,660

Oh, play no.

4593
03:21:46,080 --> 03:21:48,320
But Jitas de Polo is mine and only mine.

4594
03:21:49,540 --> 03:21:50,560
I'm the only person.

4595

That's okay.

4601
03:21:59,840 --> 03:22:01,760
I'm used to it by now because of my...

4602
03:22:01,760 --> 03:22:03,240
Oh, because of what?

4603
03:22:03,560 --> 03:22:04,240

03:25:10,880 --> 03:25:12,620
What do you mean R to buy guns?

4667
03:25:13,240 --> 03:25:15,520
If you go into R, oh yeah, what do we mean?

4668
03:25:15,600 --> 03:25:16,560
And then you go into Warbon.

4669
03:25:16,700 --> 03:25:18,140
You see R, press R.

4670
03:25:18,680 --> 03:25:19,020

4676
03:25:30,800 --> 03:25:36,960
going down the gun that I'm using it's on page five out of
eight it's called the site what did I get I really like it

4677

uh I get like get the guns I usually try to get the guns the
grenade and the super credit oh wait did I I think I bought

4678
03:25:43,300 --> 03:25:51,740
something on accident when I meant to wait that's fine I
thought so it's a battle pass so the more so basically you

4679
03:25:51,740 --> 03:26:00,280
have to lock some of the pages be able to move down a page
basically so you didn't technically fuck off you have to

4680
03:26:00,280 --> 03:26:07,920
unlock oh i see okay i thought i was redeeming oh my god
this is what's this thing a super credit was i can't see oh

4681
03:26:07,920 --> 03:26:13,500
so super credits is like the current like in blocking
currency but you could find that shit in the overworld and

4682
03:26:13,500 --> 03:26:19,260
but get them from the battle pass too i want to be able to
climb it's super it's super free to play friendly nice yeah

4683
03:26:19,260 --> 03:26:29,000
yeah yeah you just have to play a lot you know yeah it's not
like i have 141 hours of this game what's the what's the

4684
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:37,920
grenade that launches immediately oh that's called the high
impact rate and that's in several pages down okay oh i think

4685
03:26:37,920 --> 03:26:43,370
i got that i believe in

4686
03:26:47,800 --> 03:26:54,520
oh wait the game is always free to play you can even collect
super credits in game like if you play a lot of hours you

4687

How do I...

4694
03:27:07,120 --> 03:27:07,240
What?

4695
03:27:07,940 --> 03:27:09,220
Oh, that's what you meant.

4696
03:27:09,340 --> 03:27:10,260
You have to buy the game.

4697
03:27:10,380 --> 03:27:10,800
Okay, okay.

4698
03:27:11,720 --> 03:27:16,080
Sometimes I've seen people come and chat be like, Oh, is the
game free on random games?

4699
03:27:16,180 --> 03:27:16,820
I'm like, why?

4700
03:27:17,180 --> 03:27:18,100
Why do you...

4701
03:27:18,100 --> 03:27:19,560
Why do you think it would be free?

4702
03:27:20,380 --> 03:27:21,000
It could be.

4703
03:27:21,280 --> 03:27:21,720
I don't know.

4704
03:27:21,860 --> 03:27:22,940
It could be, but why?

4705
03:27:23,240 --> 03:27:25,000
Wait, how do I change my...

4706
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:26,540
How do I change my weapon and stuff?

4707
03:27:27,740 --> 03:27:28,760
Oh, we have to...

4708
03:27:28,760 --> 03:27:29,500
She has to...

4709
03:27:29,500 --> 03:27:29,740
Great.

4710
03:27:30,560 --> 03:27:31,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4711
03:27:31,620 --> 03:27:32,080
Oh, okay.

4712
03:27:32,160 --> 03:27:33,560
Come to come here.

4713
03:27:33,840 --> 03:27:40,420
Actually, you can change it during the mission, but if you
come to this computer right here, and then you go into his

4714
03:27:40,420 --> 03:27:43,500
armory, and then character booster, you can, like, see
everything.

4715
03:27:43,580 --> 03:27:46,220
So you can go into armory and then change your armors,
change your stuff.

4716
03:27:47,380 --> 03:27:48,660
Let's try this one.

4717
03:27:49,100 --> 03:27:49,600
Is it equipped?

4718
03:27:50,160 --> 03:27:51,660
You know what else you can change?

4719
03:27:52,880 --> 03:27:53,260
Everything.

4720
03:27:53,580 --> 03:27:54,140
These nuts.

4721
03:27:57,940 --> 03:27:58,600
He's gone.

4722
03:27:58,840 --> 03:27:59,340
We lost her.

4723
03:27:59,500 --> 03:28:00,420
We lost her.

4724
03:28:00,480 --> 03:28:01,200
The Jeevra.

4725
03:28:04,360 --> 03:28:05,220
Wait, but this one...

4726
03:28:05,220 --> 03:28:05,860
We lost her.

4727
03:28:06,280 --> 03:28:08,320
Oh, I guess this one has a longer fuse time.

4728
03:28:09,740 --> 03:28:10,480
But this one...

4729
03:28:10,480 --> 03:28:10,660
Okay.

4730
03:28:12,680 --> 03:28:14,020
I kind of look like a bug.

4731
03:28:16,420 --> 03:28:17,560
I'm so high.

4732
03:28:17,740 --> 03:28:18,000
Shit.

4733
03:28:18,080 --> 03:28:19,140
Oh my god, my face.

4734
03:28:19,340 --> 03:28:20,800
Oh yeah, Haru, what time did you go to sleep today?

4735
03:28:21,700 --> 03:28:23,160
I don't think you really want to know.

4736
03:28:23,300 --> 03:28:23,940
Yeah, I do.

4737
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:24,820
Is it 4 p.m.?

4738
03:28:24,820 --> 03:28:26,220
Wait, where's the other gun that I got?

4739
03:28:26,520 --> 03:28:26,780
No.

4740
03:28:27,120 --> 03:28:28,660
It was 1 p.m.

4741
03:28:28,660 --> 03:28:29,440
Do I have to...

4742
03:28:29,500 --> 03:28:34,580
order that one some of the other guns you have to order like
you know in game when you can put a gun yeah yeah like you

4743
03:28:34,580 --> 03:28:39,300
summon from the big crate some of the guns you summon from
the big crates shotgun so there's your primary weapon which

4744
03:28:39,300 --> 03:28:45,520
is like your regular gun secondary weapon which is like a
little revolver grenades and then you summon special guns

4745
03:28:45,520 --> 03:28:52,000
yeah yeah yeah i figured the special gun i figured yeah yeah
so the special guns like it just depends what you like to do

4746
03:28:52,000 --> 03:28:55,820
okay for me i hate ammo so i always try to get guns that
don't use ammo

4747
03:29:01,490 --> 03:29:03,030
Oh, wait, here we go.

4748
03:29:03,230 --> 03:29:03,670
I ate it.

4749
03:29:10,490 --> 03:29:13,210
That's the most evil laugh I've ever heard from you, and I'm
terrified for my life.

4750
03:29:13,850 --> 03:29:15,110
No, I've heard more evil.

4751
03:29:17,030 --> 03:29:21,290
But I go to bed tonight, and if I have a sleep paralysis,
and I hear that evil laughter, I know it's too.

4752
03:29:21,290 --> 03:29:24,230
I'm the sleep paralysis demon coming to visit you.

4753
03:29:26,370 --> 03:29:27,690
Wait, so are you a demon now?

4754
03:29:27,770 --> 03:29:28,210
Are you a ghost?

4755
03:29:28,210 --> 03:29:30,370
My sleep paralysis ghost can't be back to you.

4756
03:29:31,450 --> 03:29:33,170
I'm a ghost, I'm a ghost.

4757
03:29:33,670 --> 03:29:34,190
What is it?

4758
03:29:34,630 --> 03:29:35,490
Yeah, I was very confused.

4759
03:29:35,870 --> 03:29:37,730
I swore so...

4760
03:29:37,730 --> 03:29:40,050
Mbata, your ritual was disturbing.

4761
03:29:40,690 --> 03:29:43,530
I don't know what I messed up in it, genuinely.

4762
03:29:44,830 --> 03:29:46,050
I'm a ghost.

4763
03:29:48,230 --> 03:29:51,210
Okay, this mission is fast.

4764
03:29:51,750 --> 03:29:52,130
Fast.

4765
03:29:52,630 --> 03:29:54,270
We go in, we kill, we get out.

4766
03:29:54,870 --> 03:29:57,410
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

4767
03:29:58,270 --> 03:29:58,350
Nice.

4768
03:29:58,350 --> 03:29:58,470
Boom.

4769
03:29:58,790 --> 03:30:00,670
I already forgot what I already put.

4770
03:30:00,670 --> 03:30:02,230
I already put the microwave on fire.

4771
03:30:02,350 --> 03:30:02,690
What are we doing?

4772
03:30:03,530 --> 03:30:04,850
We all scratched at once.

4773
03:30:07,230 --> 03:30:07,970
Instruction's unclear.

4774
03:30:08,190 --> 03:30:09,250
I already blew up the house.

4775
03:30:11,610 --> 03:30:13,570
One of these two.

4776
03:30:16,890 --> 03:30:18,390
I don't know why that reminded me of that.

4777
03:30:24,620 --> 03:30:27,560
I still have this game audio turned off.

4778
03:30:46,600 --> 03:30:47,860
Mint, you're getting it.

4779
03:30:48,280 --> 03:31:01,260
the vibe i think i don't know it's still fun though here we
go i feel like singing the song right oh yeah wait okay you

4780
03:31:01,260 --> 03:31:08,680
get it you get it that's our girl so run towards the red
stuff because that's where the holes are close as many holes

4781
03:31:08,680 --> 03:31:20,240
as you can okay you know what else we can close the hole
with god gone what you thought i was gonna say no i i was

4782
03:31:20,240 --> 03:31:29,200
not i can't believe you thought what i don't even see red on
the map yeah because it's like sort of so this planet so the

4783
03:31:29,200 --> 03:31:36,720
shitty thing about this gas planet is that it covers up the
compass so we don't get to see anything just run until you

4784
03:31:36,720 --> 03:31:46,680
find by ourselves he's asleep don't let him wake up don't
let him wake up

4785
03:31:49,720 --> 03:31:51,100
Yeah, take that.

4786
03:31:53,580 --> 03:31:56,320
With the green bugs, what's their place to shoot them in?

4787
03:31:56,800 --> 03:31:57,620
The phase as well.

4788
03:31:58,960 --> 03:32:01,920
Because they're armored nursing stores, since.

4789
03:32:02,040 --> 03:32:02,740
Oh, they explode.

4790
03:32:03,300 --> 03:32:03,880
They're more annoying.

4791
03:32:04,380 --> 03:32:04,700
Yeah.

4792
03:32:05,260 --> 03:32:06,180
You gotta hit them in the phase.

4793
03:32:07,500 --> 03:32:08,020
Oh.

4794
03:32:08,840 --> 03:32:09,680
Oh, my God.

4795
03:32:09,740 --> 03:32:10,680
Are you kidding me?

4796
03:32:10,860 --> 03:32:11,040
No.

4797
03:32:12,740 --> 03:32:13,500
I'm kidding.

4798
03:32:13,740 --> 03:32:15,640
No, I'm not joking around me.

4799
03:32:16,740 --> 03:32:18,220
It is indeed a thing.

4800
03:32:19,420 --> 03:32:20,840
I can't tell if I'm heading somewhere.

4801
03:32:21,960 --> 03:32:22,640
Maybe I was.

4802
03:32:22,740 --> 03:32:24,500
This is the thing that exploded last time, right?

4803
03:32:24,940 --> 03:32:25,820
Oh, bobo, bobo, bobo.

4804
03:32:26,500 --> 03:32:26,760
Easy.

4805
03:32:27,920 --> 03:32:28,660
Breezy, beautiful.

4806
03:32:29,020 --> 03:32:29,220
Oh, God.

4807
03:32:29,280 --> 03:32:29,880
Cover girl.

4808
03:32:31,600 --> 03:32:32,840
Give me the stupid sample.

4809
03:32:33,780 --> 03:32:35,640
Oh my God, this is the stupidest sample ever.

4810
03:32:36,000 --> 03:32:36,800
What's the sample?

4811
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:41,180
I like using the high impact grenade on them, this pure
muzzle.

4812
03:32:42,000 --> 03:32:42,760
They died a one hit.

4813
03:32:44,940 --> 03:32:46,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's March.

4814
03:32:46,140 --> 03:32:47,040
Like on their face?

4815
03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:47,740
already.

4816
03:32:47,960 --> 03:32:49,200
Yeah, this is a fast mission.

4817
03:32:49,380 --> 03:32:49,940
You just gotta run.

4818
03:32:50,420 --> 03:32:51,880
I haven't found it yet.

4819
03:32:52,480 --> 03:32:53,380
I haven't found any.

4820
03:32:53,680 --> 03:32:54,660
Oh, I found I found one.

4821
03:32:55,000 --> 03:32:55,760
So oh, there's one.

4822
03:32:55,920 --> 03:32:56,500
There's one there.

4823
03:32:57,200 --> 03:33:00,120
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

4824
03:33:01,840 --> 03:33:03,040
Nice, nice, nice.

4825
03:33:03,960 --> 03:33:05,840
I found some hooves.

4826
03:33:08,600 --> 03:33:09,720
I'm putting down an eagle.

4827
03:33:09,940 --> 03:33:10,520
Did not come in here.

4828
03:33:10,960 --> 03:33:11,660
Oh, wait.

4829
03:33:11,820 --> 03:33:12,300
Putting out what?

4830
03:33:12,560 --> 03:33:12,600
Okay, okay.

4831
03:33:12,700 --> 03:33:13,120
I'm not coming.

4832
03:33:13,440 --> 03:33:14,380
Oh, I'm in somewhere.

4833
03:33:15,060 --> 03:33:15,800
Oh, okay.

4834
03:33:16,000 --> 03:33:16,620
I missed it.

4835
03:33:19,180 --> 03:33:20,440
Oh, there's a stalker.

4836
03:33:20,440 --> 03:33:21,400
He's invisible.

4837
03:33:21,680 --> 03:33:22,180
He's invisible.

4838
03:33:22,920 --> 03:33:24,860
That's a stalker.

4839
03:33:25,060 --> 03:33:25,480
I got it.

4840
03:33:25,520 --> 03:33:26,180
Those are annoying.

4841
03:33:26,680 --> 03:33:27,360
Oh, no.

4842
03:33:27,560 --> 03:33:29,600
I thought the stalkers come on harder difficulties.

4843
03:33:30,220 --> 03:33:31,500
Oh, is this an invisible one?

4844
03:33:31,960 --> 03:33:32,240
Yeah.

4845
03:33:32,660 --> 03:33:34,900
We just need three holes and we're done.

4846
03:33:35,260 --> 03:33:36,280
Wait, is this one over here?

4847
03:33:37,720 --> 03:33:39,180
Yeah, you see the stalkers coming out of here?

4848
03:33:39,480 --> 03:33:40,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4849
03:33:40,480 --> 03:33:41,380
I see, I see, I see.

4850
03:33:42,820 --> 03:33:43,580
Wow, you're right.

4851
03:33:43,760 --> 03:33:45,400
One impact grenade really does kill them.

4852
03:33:45,480 --> 03:33:46,080
That's crazy.

4853
03:33:46,340 --> 03:33:46,920
Oh my God.

4854
03:33:47,040 --> 03:33:47,740
Oh my god.

4855
03:33:47,840 --> 03:33:48,060
Oh my god.

4856
03:33:48,100 --> 03:33:48,400
Oh my god.

4857
03:33:49,220 --> 03:33:50,420
You're doing amazing, Mint.

4858
03:33:51,300 --> 03:33:51,980
I'm so sorry, Mint.

4859
03:33:53,220 --> 03:33:54,040
She's not sorry.

4860
03:33:54,220 --> 03:33:55,200
She's doing it on purpose.

4861
03:33:55,360 --> 03:33:56,580
It's because you haunt her at night.

4862
03:33:56,900 --> 03:33:58,720
It is because I... Oh my god.

4863
03:33:58,940 --> 03:33:59,880
Wait, where is it?

4864
03:33:59,960 --> 03:34:00,940
Where is it the hole?

4865
03:34:01,420 --> 03:34:02,740
Oh my god.

4866
03:34:02,880 --> 03:34:03,560
What the hell is there?

4867
03:34:04,760 --> 03:34:05,960
Oh, I'm right next to it!

4868
03:34:06,100 --> 03:34:07,520

M1 reporting for duty.

03:35:59,100 --> 03:35:59,320
Yeah.

03:36:02,080 --> 03:36:02,400
I see them.

4911
03:36:02,400 --> 03:36:02,660
I see them.

4912
03:36:02,660 --> 03:36:04,440
I'm following you then.

4913
03:36:04,880 --> 03:36:05,540
Yeah, follow me.

4914
03:36:05,560 --> 03:36:05,940
M1 to M3.

03:36:07,440 --> 03:36:08,420
Oh, I see it.

4916
03:36:09,040 --> 03:36:09,540
I see it.

4917
03:36:09,620 --> 03:36:09,820
I see it.

4918
03:36:10,060 --> 03:36:10,440
I see it.

4919
03:36:10,440 --> 03:36:10,600
I see it.

4920
03:36:10,900 --> 03:36:11,220
I see it.

4921
03:36:11,340 --> 03:36:11,840
Oh, yeah.

4922
03:36:12,120 --> 03:36:12,440
Yeah.

4923
03:36:14,080 --> 03:36:14,920
Oh, I see it.

4924
03:36:17,040 --> 03:36:18,080
I'm going towards it.

4925
03:36:18,320 --> 03:36:18,800
I'm going to it.

4926
03:36:18,920 --> 03:36:19,380
I'm going to it.

4927
03:36:19,700 --> 03:36:19,820
Not.

4928
03:36:19,900 --> 03:36:21,200
Don't go too close to it.

4929
03:36:21,320 --> 03:36:22,320
I sent a bomb.

4930
03:36:22,660 --> 03:36:26,480
Well, you could have said that like first night.

4931
03:36:27,400 --> 03:36:28,400
I said it.

4932
03:36:28,720 --> 03:36:30,460
No, you just said don't go close.

4933
03:36:31,920 --> 03:36:35,260
Well, I mean, what do you think I would do when I first find
the hole?

4934
03:36:35,560 --> 03:36:36,960
I would block it.

4935
03:36:37,040 --> 03:36:37,840
Oh, oh, oh.

4936
03:36:40,540 --> 03:36:41,340
I don't know.

4937
03:36:41,420 --> 03:36:42,500
Please, let me out.

4938
03:36:42,580 --> 03:36:43,220
Let me out.

4939
03:36:43,700 --> 03:36:44,520
Let me out.

4940
03:36:44,900 --> 03:36:46,140
It's like the opposite of let me in.

4941
03:36:46,380 --> 03:36:46,820
Let me out.

4942
03:36:47,040 --> 03:36:48,280
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

4943
03:36:48,420 --> 03:36:49,020
I'm gonna die.

4944
03:36:49,160 --> 03:36:50,720
Oh, no, you won't.

4945
03:36:50,800 --> 03:36:51,180
You're gonna live.

4946
03:36:53,160 --> 03:36:53,820
Oh my god.

4947
03:36:54,520 --> 03:36:55,820
You said I would live, you liar.

4948
03:36:56,560 --> 03:36:57,020
I lied.

4949
03:36:57,240 --> 03:37:01,260
Fuck, I accidentally got- I accidentally took your gun and
I- Ugh.

4950
03:37:03,220 --> 03:37:03,940
My gun?

4951
03:37:04,040 --> 03:37:05,040
Can you revive them, Henya?

4952
03:37:05,920 --> 03:37:07,120
Okay, okay, okay, hold on.

4953
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:11,120
Yeah, I accidentally picked up a different gun and then I
couldn't switch.

4954
03:37:11,520 --> 03:37:12,220
Help me.

4955
03:37:13,580 --> 03:37:15,840
Oh, yeah.

4956
03:37:18,340 --> 03:37:19,560
Hania, no pressure.

4957
03:37:20,760 --> 03:37:21,920
Well, I already coded.

4958
03:37:22,500 --> 03:37:22,880
Good girl.

4959
03:37:22,900 --> 03:37:23,840
Yeah, good job, H2.

4960
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:25,060
Oh, thank you.

4961
03:37:25,060 --> 03:37:26,480
I meant no pressure, like, hurry up.

4962
03:37:29,020 --> 03:37:31,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4963
03:37:31,380 --> 03:37:33,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4964
03:37:34,220 --> 03:37:36,120
There's a lot of bugs.

4965
03:37:36,280 --> 03:37:36,680
Oh, gosh.

4966
03:37:36,760 --> 03:37:37,160
Oh, God.

4967
03:37:37,280 --> 03:37:38,700
Oh, I'm going to die again.

4968
03:37:39,440 --> 03:37:40,220
No, you're fine, man.

4969
03:37:40,260 --> 03:37:40,540
Don't worry.

4970
03:37:40,700 --> 03:37:40,840
Don't worry.

4971
03:37:41,400 --> 03:37:41,760
Don't worry.

4972
03:37:43,220 --> 03:37:44,400
I was killed by nothing.

4973
03:37:44,860 --> 03:37:45,300
I just died.

4974
03:37:47,380 --> 03:37:48,540
That's what they all say.

4975
03:37:50,120 --> 03:37:52,380
It just said killed by blank.

4976
03:37:53,920 --> 03:37:55,400
Oh, maybe that's a weird bug.

4977
03:37:56,160 --> 03:37:57,340
Killed by blank.

4978
03:37:57,360 --> 03:37:58,620
I don't think I've seen that before.

4979
03:37:59,660 --> 03:38:00,660
I've seen it a few times.

4980
03:38:01,100 --> 03:38:02,120
How did I miss?

4981
03:38:02,460 --> 03:38:04,600
Oh my god, how could you miss that?

4982
03:38:04,860 --> 03:38:06,020
How could you miss that?

4983
03:38:06,060 --> 03:38:07,340
It was right in front of you.

4984
03:38:07,640 --> 03:38:09,920
It was right in front of you.

4985
03:38:10,300 --> 03:38:11,680
How did you miss?

4986
03:38:12,260 --> 03:38:13,420
How did you miss?

4987
03:38:14,520 --> 03:38:16,960
When everybody's looking, I feel weird.

4988
03:38:17,040 --> 03:38:18,100
I felt that.

4989
03:38:18,100 --> 03:38:18,700
You know what, Matta?

4990
03:38:19,060 --> 03:38:19,820
I'm getting deja vu.

4991
03:38:20,120 --> 03:38:22,600
You said this shit to me a month ago.

4992
03:38:22,860 --> 03:38:23,840
Which one?

4993
03:38:24,820 --> 03:38:25,960
That performance anxiety.

4994
03:38:26,620 --> 03:38:28,520
So I told you everyone's watching you do the arrow games.

4995
03:38:28,660 --> 03:38:29,660
They're like, no, stop.

4996
03:38:29,780 --> 03:38:30,600
I have a performance anxiety.

4997
03:38:31,020 --> 03:38:31,380
I do.

4998
03:38:31,520 --> 03:38:32,020
It's true.

4999
03:38:32,280 --> 03:38:34,440
I, you know, please turn the lights off.

5000
03:38:35,120 --> 03:38:35,300
Right?

5001
03:38:36,620 --> 03:38:37,780
I'm dead, by the way.

5002
03:38:38,080 --> 03:38:38,760
So, uh...

5003
03:38:38,760 --> 03:38:41,600
I thought you're already dead because you're a ghost and
everything.

5004
03:38:41,920 --> 03:38:42,000
Ah.

5005
03:38:42,860 --> 03:38:43,560
I'm so fine.

5006
03:38:43,580 --> 03:38:46,860
By the way, you should try not dying in this game so that
you can do damage.

5007
03:38:47,040 --> 03:38:48,760
Yeah, that's a good plan.

5008
03:38:50,220 --> 03:38:51,060
I'll try that.

5009
03:38:51,860 --> 03:38:54,480
I don't think it's subtle.

5010
03:38:54,820 --> 03:38:55,700
I don't think it's a subtle bit.

5011
03:38:56,160 --> 03:38:57,820
I don't think that was very subtle.

5012
03:38:58,240 --> 03:38:59,120
Four minutes.

5013
03:39:00,320 --> 03:39:01,580
Where is the extraction?

5014
03:39:01,700 --> 03:39:02,440
Oh, I see the extraction.

5015
03:39:02,960 --> 03:39:04,100
Okay, let's run to the extraction.

5016
03:39:04,720 --> 03:39:05,760
Just see the...

5017
03:39:05,760 --> 03:39:06,460
I say let's run.

5018
03:39:06,680 --> 03:39:08,100
Meanwhile, you guys are already there.

5019
03:39:09,300 --> 03:39:11,260
She told me to run, but I was already there.

5020
03:39:11,760 --> 03:39:13,240

5021
03:39:13,560 --> 03:39:14,000

What is that?

5036

03:40:02,380 --> 03:40:05,220

Probably.

I think you're a pro.

5046
03:40:15,440 --> 03:40:15,900
Guys!

5047
03:40:18,460 --> 03:40:20,160

03:40:20,400 --> 03:40:21,540

03:40:22,120 --> 03:40:22,600

5053
03:40:26,300 --> 03:40:26,940
I'm running.

5054
03:40:27,620 --> 03:40:28,160
I'm running.

5055
03:40:29,340 --> 03:40:29,900
No, no.

5056
03:40:30,520 --> 03:40:33,440
I came to your rescue.

5057
03:40:34,440 --> 03:40:35,500
M has come to.

5058
03:40:37,660 --> 03:40:38,360
Got a rescue.

5059
03:40:40,300 --> 03:40:45,660
Oh, I tried to dodge, but I just did a silly.

5060
03:40:47,040 --> 03:40:48,040
Yeah you only had a don.

5061
03:40:48,420 --> 03:40:48,740
I don't.

5062
03:40:48,740 --> 03:40:49,720
And I'll be really proud.

5063
03:40:49,840 --> 03:40:50,540
I'm offense.

5064
03:40:50,780 --> 03:40:51,580
I'm not defense.

5065
03:40:53,460 --> 03:40:54,920
You know what they say?

5066
03:40:57,220 --> 03:40:58,100
Best defense.

5067
03:40:58,340 --> 03:40:58,840
Right here.

5068
03:40:59,720 --> 03:41:00,120
Yeah!

5069
03:41:01,820 --> 03:41:03,700
Oh, what the?

5070
03:41:03,780 --> 03:41:04,980
Where did he come from?

5071
03:41:05,820 --> 03:41:06,780
Where did he come from?

5072
03:41:06,900 --> 03:41:07,620
Where did he go?

5073
03:41:07,840 --> 03:41:08,880
Where did he come from?

5074
03:41:09,380 --> 03:41:10,760
Oh, Hanya killed me.

5075
03:41:10,880 --> 03:41:12,100
He was married a long time ago.

5076
03:41:12,480 --> 03:41:13,900
Oh, it must be game glitch.

5077
03:41:13,900 --> 03:41:14,960
Must be game glitch.

5078
03:41:15,040 --> 03:41:16,600
Oh, game glitch, game glitch.

5079
03:41:17,040 --> 03:41:18,300
Must be must be.

5080
03:41:21,620 --> 03:41:22,740
10 seconds, 10 seconds.

5081
03:41:23,700 --> 03:41:24,640
I love it.

5082
03:41:25,300 --> 03:41:26,260
Let me in.

5083
03:41:27,060 --> 03:41:29,120
Don't leave without me.

5084
03:41:29,280 --> 03:41:29,800
Let me in.

5085
03:41:30,180 --> 03:41:32,660
I have visual on the extraction zone.

5086
03:41:34,680 --> 03:41:35,160
Let me in.

5087
03:41:36,680 --> 03:41:37,700
Preparing for touchdown.

5088
03:41:38,000 --> 03:41:39,260
Preparing for touchdown.

5089
03:41:40,560 --> 03:41:41,800
Arriving at LZ.

5090
03:41:43,140 --> 03:41:49,140
So, Mint, every time I play with Zen, when we're all running
into the ship, She just punches me as I'm about to run into

5091
03:41:49,140 --> 03:41:50,660
the ship every time.

5092
03:41:51,420 --> 03:41:52,520
Yep, she does that.

5093
03:41:52,980 --> 03:41:53,980
Every single time.

5094
03:41:54,120 --> 03:41:54,580
That's her zen.

5095
03:41:54,940 --> 03:41:55,560
She what?

5096
03:41:55,900 --> 03:41:56,600
Oh, really?

5097
03:41:57,300 --> 03:41:58,020
It's fine.

5098
03:41:58,280 --> 03:41:58,860
It's fine.

5099
03:41:59,160 --> 03:42:00,380
I just heard it.

5100
03:42:00,400 --> 03:42:00,520
Ah!

5101
03:42:03,460 --> 03:42:03,880
Ah!

5102
03:42:03,880 --> 03:42:06,120
Were you going to push somebody off the ship?

5103
03:42:06,480 --> 03:42:06,820
Don't tell.

5104
03:42:07,520 --> 03:42:07,680
Huh?

5105
03:42:07,680 --> 03:42:08,580
When you were telling that story?

5106
03:42:09,220 --> 03:42:09,460
Yes.

5107
03:42:10,280 --> 03:42:11,420
What about my story?

5108
03:42:12,220 --> 03:42:12,520
I what?

5109
03:42:13,300 --> 03:42:13,840
I was like, you pissed?

5110
03:42:13,840 --> 03:42:14,640
What did I want?

5111
03:42:14,640 --> 03:42:14,760
Why?

5112
03:42:14,760 --> 03:42:16,520
You were going to push somebody off the ship, weren't you?

5113
03:42:17,040 --> 03:42:17,700
tell that story.

5114
03:42:18,040 --> 03:42:18,620
That's what you're saying.

5115
03:42:18,780 --> 03:42:19,280
I deserved it.

5116
03:42:19,320 --> 03:42:20,300
What happened, Matara?

5117
03:42:20,320 --> 03:42:22,580
No, no, I deserved it because I died.

5118
03:42:23,040 --> 03:42:23,740
What happened?

5119
03:42:24,100 --> 03:42:25,440
You deserved it because you died?

5120
03:42:25,720 --> 03:42:28,540
You only deserved it because you were about to do something.

5121
03:42:29,660 --> 03:42:31,340
Troll me, weren't you, Matara Khan?

5122
03:42:32,000 --> 03:42:32,940
Troll me?

5123
03:42:33,320 --> 03:42:35,100
If I wanted to troll, I wouldn't explain.

5124
03:42:35,180 --> 03:42:35,540
Troll Khan?

5125
03:42:36,780 --> 03:42:37,440
Troll Khan.

5126
03:42:37,840 --> 03:42:39,520
Troll Tara Khan.

5127
03:42:40,460 --> 03:42:46,320
Or, as Hania would say, Khan Tara, Khan,

5128
03:42:53,760 --> 03:42:54,960
My channel.

5129
03:42:55,660 --> 03:42:58,420
All my streams get demonetized anyway.

5130
03:43:01,640 --> 03:43:02,260
All of them?

5131
03:43:02,660 --> 03:43:03,120
On YouTube?

5132
03:43:03,340 --> 03:43:03,620
For real?

5133
03:43:03,720 --> 03:43:06,300
A good bit have been recently, yeah.

5134
03:43:06,300 --> 03:43:07,200
What have you been saying?

5135
03:43:07,320 --> 03:43:08,240
What kind of shenanigans?

5136
03:43:08,700 --> 03:43:12,100
No, it's like a music stuff that happens.

5137
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:13,900
Oh, it happens.

5138
03:43:14,080 --> 03:43:14,800
So stupid.

5139
03:43:14,800 --> 03:43:17,780
Have you considered not like playing copyrighted music?

5140
03:43:18,360 --> 03:43:24,660
No, it's because like channels will like upload music from
games and then even though they're not the actual owner of

5141
03:43:24,660 --> 03:43:26,600
the music and then they'll claim my videos.

5142
03:43:27,100 --> 03:43:28,560
Oh yeah, that happened.

5143
03:43:29,240 --> 03:43:30,320
Yeah, I had that happen too.

5144
03:43:30,820 --> 03:43:32,160
One time I put like Bach.

5145
03:43:32,620 --> 03:43:38,800
I actually looked up classical like no copyright music and I
got like 15 or something claims for that.

5146
03:43:38,940 --> 03:43:39,660
And I said no more.

5147
03:43:40,140 --> 03:43:42,140
You guys are getting BGM and nothing else.

5148
03:43:42,820 --> 03:43:44,000
Yeah, it's so awful.

5149
03:43:44,480 --> 03:43:44,560
Yup, yup, yup.

5150
03:43:44,800 --> 03:43:45,480
It happens.

5151
03:43:45,760 --> 03:43:45,900
It happens.

5152
03:43:45,920 --> 03:43:47,480
That's why I like to use video game music a lot.

5153
03:43:48,860 --> 03:43:52,300
You have to be careful because sometimes like what she just
said that channels will.

5154
03:43:52,980 --> 03:43:53,000
Yeah.

5155
03:43:55,740 --> 03:44:01,760
Well, maybe because I stream on Twitch and I know that I
play a lot of playing games with the BGM music seems fine.

5156
03:44:03,160 --> 03:44:10,420
But that's that was my point saying if it's okay to play the
game with the BGM then it should be okay.

5157
03:44:11,460 --> 03:44:13,060
But that is really dumb.

5158
03:44:13,360 --> 03:44:14,560
Yeah, it's silly.

5159
03:44:15,580 --> 03:44:23,400
yeah it happened it happened it's how um how do y'all feel
about that being the last game feel feel good you don't want

5160
03:44:23,400 --> 03:44:28,580

You're not going to share this with the class, can you?

03:44:57,860 --> 03:45:01,180

5272
03:51:42,720 --> 03:51:46,980
Stopping myself from oh, oh.

03:51:48,520 --> 03:51:48,620
Oh.

5274
03:51:50,960 --> 03:51:53,200
Uh, I have to do this.

5275
03:51:57,580 --> 03:51:58,360
I don't know how tall.

5276
03:51:58,420 --> 03:52:00,900
He said seven foot, so...

5277
03:52:01,840 --> 03:52:04,660
How tall would I be next to someone who's seven foot?

5278
03:52:16,160 --> 03:52:16,720
Lower?

5279
03:52:17,240 --> 03:52:17,640
Lower?

5280
03:52:17,980 --> 03:52:18,240
Lower?

5281
03:52:20,340 --> 03:52:21,280
Like here?

5282
03:52:21,660 --> 03:52:22,060
No.

5283
03:52:22,340 --> 03:52:23,320
I think like here.

5284
03:52:26,460 --> 03:52:27,100
Did you like the game?

5285
03:52:27,160 --> 03:52:27,480
Yes!

5286
03:52:27,580 --> 03:52:28,720
I had so much fun!

5287
03:52:29,320 --> 03:52:30,060
It's a lot.

5288
03:52:30,140 --> 03:52:31,720
It's definitely like...

5289
03:52:33,520 --> 03:52:39,560
sword um it's not a game that i think i could play for like
i mean i played for four hours almost today but it's not a

5290
03:52:39,560 --> 03:52:47,360
game i think i could do for so much just because it's like
everything overload like it's like there's this guy coming

5291
03:52:47,360 --> 03:52:55,220
over here you know it's just a little bit of a sensory
overload in a bit of a way but um you would be at his waist

5292
03:52:55,220 --> 03:52:58,440
no i would not No, I would not.

5293
03:52:59,340 --> 03:53:00,800
You guys, I'm not that small.

5294
03:53:01,920 --> 03:53:03,580
Yeah, it's a tense game for sure.

5295
03:53:04,060 --> 03:53:04,960
But it's so fun.

5296
03:53:06,000 --> 03:53:06,920
It's nice with friends.

5297
03:53:07,060 --> 03:53:08,240
Yeah, I can see.

5298
03:53:08,640 --> 03:53:12,100
I think by myself, I would be like...

5299
03:53:12,100 --> 03:53:14,180
You know, I would get a little...

5300
03:53:14,180 --> 03:53:15,540
I mean, I already got overwhelmed.

5301
03:53:15,860 --> 03:53:18,500
But it's still a lot of fun.

5302
03:53:22,840 --> 03:53:24,360
Around the tummy and chest.

5303
03:53:24,460 --> 03:53:25,320
Wait, so...

5304
03:53:27,700 --> 03:53:28,400
Like this.

5305
03:53:28,440 --> 03:53:39,940
this is me don't talk to me or my son ever again oh hell no
let me also bring up my other arm I only have one arm up

5306
03:53:41,280 --> 03:53:42,320
there we go

5307
03:53:45,900 --> 03:53:52,000
is it great today just do image training of venom snake
diving away from enemy yeah that's the one thing it was the

5308
03:53:52,000 --> 03:53:57,560
diving it's because it's alt I might rebind it to be honest
to be like space or something because you don't use space

5309
03:53:57,560 --> 03:54:06,220
for anything right not that I know of know of but it being
alt just like messes up my fingers

5310
03:54:10,620 --> 03:54:20,500
I put it on shift oh well you use it for climbing unless
you're running that's true yes yes that's true that's true

5311
03:54:21,180 --> 03:54:30,960
yeah vaulting is space then I'll I'll figure it out I'll
rebind it to something that isn't so uh I use extra mouse

5312
03:54:30,960 --> 03:54:31,200
buttons.

5313
03:54:31,480 --> 03:54:32,460
Oh, that's a good idea, too.

5314
03:54:32,620 --> 03:54:34,340
Like the side ones.

5315
03:54:34,620 --> 03:54:38,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5316
03:54:39,300 --> 03:54:39,440
So.

5317
03:54:40,460 --> 03:54:42,020
Mouse wheel for climbing?

5318
03:54:42,980 --> 03:54:43,360
What?

5319
03:54:44,120 --> 03:54:44,540
Really?

5320
03:54:46,880 --> 03:54:48,080
That seems...

5321
03:54:48,080 --> 03:54:48,820
Is that normal?

5322
03:54:53,720 --> 03:54:55,080
Is that normal?

5323
03:54:55,620 --> 03:54:55,800
Hmm.

5324
03:54:58,450 --> 03:54:59,050
Seems...

5325
03:54:59,050 --> 03:55:00,110
I don't know if I like that.

5326
03:55:02,570 --> 03:55:03,170
Ah.

5327
03:55:03,650 --> 03:55:04,250
I don't know.

5328
03:55:04,270 --> 03:55:05,890
do dive more than vaulting.

5329
03:55:06,190 --> 03:55:06,810
That's true.

5330
03:55:07,610 --> 03:55:13,090
I need something that I can like click really quickly, you
know, to get up and dive and get up and dive and get up and

5331
03:55:13,090 --> 03:55:13,430
dive.

5332
03:55:14,850 --> 03:55:16,050
This game has stealth.

5333
03:55:16,650 --> 03:55:17,470
What, when you crawl?

5334
03:55:20,530 --> 03:55:23,650
That would make sense, because there is crawling and stuff.

5335
03:55:26,890 --> 03:55:30,430
But yeah, hopefully you guys have fun watching our chaos.

5336
03:55:31,130 --> 03:55:34,190

03:58:04,750 --> 03:58:05,170
Not mainstream.

5353
03:58:05,510 --> 03:58:08,630
It was popular amongst VTubers some time ago.

5354
03:58:09,850 --> 03:58:15,850
I was thinking of playing maybe Prison Princess because
it's, like, kind of, like, a hidden objects game, but not

5355
03:58:15,850 --> 03:58:16,350
really.

04:00:11,980 --> 04:00:13,900
Do they talk in the game?

5383
04:00:15,320 --> 04:00:18,600
Do they, like, do you hear their VAs?

5384
04:00:24,250 --> 04:00:27,630
The Tokidoki literature club streams are my favorite.

5385
04:00:27,770 --> 04:00:29,350
Second to the Yomawari streams.

5386
04:00:31,190 --> 04:00:34,690
The Yomawari streams where I literally lose my brain, my
mind.

5387
04:00:36,890 --> 04:00:48,790
if i've gotten better if i try and go back and play it now
if i um if i'd be better i have shiruko and hoshino nice my

5388
04:00:48,790 --> 04:01:01,310
tubu i love the reaction when henia said she's serving her
country you get more voice lines for them if you level up

5389
04:01:01,310 --> 04:01:06,890
their bonding game you guys don't understand if ogura yui
voices something i either have to play it i have to watch If

5390
04:01:06,890 --> 04:01:08,890
I watch it, I have to do anything with it.

5391
04:01:11,630 --> 04:01:13,530
Always down for a redemption arc.

5392
04:01:15,490 --> 04:01:17,990
The Yo-Mawari final boss fight.

5393
04:01:20,110 --> 04:01:22,090
It still haunts me to this day.

5394
04:01:22,410 --> 04:01:28,050
If you didn't think, if you didn't know if a ghost could get
haunted or not, it haunts me to this day.

5395
04:01:33,750 --> 04:01:35,710
What's the first anime I watched?

5396
04:01:36,890 --> 04:01:46,510
It's hard to say because like I watched anime before I knew
like you know of like anime as a genre I get like if you

5397
04:01:46,510 --> 04:01:55,790
call if you can call it that you know a medium rather so I
watched like Pokemon and Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball a lot

5398
04:01:55,790 --> 04:02:04,970
of those and then I'd say the first I think the first that I
that like because like my sister's friend was just like oh

5399
04:02:04,970 --> 04:02:16,550
do you like watch anime and I was like I don't know what
that is and she showed me uh Inuyasha so um and then from

5400
04:02:16,550 --> 04:02:24,830
there I kind of watched Conan I got into Conan I got into
cowboy bebop you know I watched all those shows that were

5401
04:02:24,830 --> 04:02:36,630
fully fully cool all the shows that were on like cartoon
network and uh my sister would like show me shows too like

5402
04:02:36,630 --> 04:02:43,290
she showed me elfinly i don't know why she showed that to me
why do i keep lagging i think the game is too beefy

5403
04:02:46,760 --> 04:02:50,660
my neuro quirk re-zero season three airs in october

5404
04:02:56,660 --> 04:03:03,800
oh my gosh yes i also watched card captors i was cleaning i
moved some stuff around in my um in my maid cafe recently

5405
04:03:03,800 --> 04:03:13,660
and so um when i was doing that i was going through some old
books and i found this old card captors book that I like

5406
04:03:13,660 --> 04:03:15,400
have had since I was a kid.

5407
04:03:15,540 --> 04:03:23,500
I even still have the cloud cards that I've had since I was
a kid and like it's just like here's Sakura's friend

5408
04:03:23,500 --> 04:03:24,620
Madison.

5409
04:03:27,900 --> 04:03:29,060
So I watched that too.

5410
04:03:29,180 --> 04:03:31,520
I never I don't think I ever watched Tokyo Mew Mew.

5411
04:03:31,800 --> 04:03:33,920
I watched a little bit of Sergeant Frog.

5412
04:03:42,020 --> 04:03:57,280
adventure card captors do you know Sora no Aozora from
Dempogumi Inc oh none oh none I absolutely know Sora no

5413
04:03:57,280 --> 04:04:06,180

group it's called Arcana Project she left she left she left

5414
04:04:06,180 --> 04:04:18,240

5416
04:04:26,460 --> 04:04:34,860

5417
04:04:34,860 --> 04:04:42,900
absolutely perfect she's my oshi there's nothing nothing
else that i can say about her she's perfect Everything that

5418
04:04:42,900 --> 04:04:45,500
she comes out of her mouth is gold.

5419
04:04:45,780 --> 04:04:46,260
It's genius.

5420
04:04:50,180 --> 04:04:51,000
She's her.

5421
04:04:51,480 --> 04:04:52,680
Yeah, she is.

5422
04:04:52,960 --> 04:04:54,000
She is her.

5423
04:04:58,350 --> 04:04:58,990
Yeah.

5424
04:04:59,770 --> 04:05:00,610
My Oshi.

5425
04:05:03,630 --> 04:05:05,970
I'm sorry to get tired, though.

5426
04:05:07,330 --> 04:05:08,650
Sorry to get tired.

5427
04:05:09,150 --> 04:05:14,050
I had a... I've been busy cleaning and doing some other
stuff.

5428
04:05:15,450 --> 04:05:22,050
So, um, I should probably go to sleep.

5429
04:05:28,560 --> 04:05:29,460
Oh, God, that way.

5430
04:05:29,560 --> 04:05:32,560
I actually, I can't stop yawning.

5431
04:05:33,620 --> 04:05:35,600
Thank you, guys, for hanging out with us.

5432
04:05:36,460 --> 04:05:37,100
I hope you had fun.

5433
04:05:37,380 --> 04:05:40,260
Hopefully it wasn't so chaotic, chaos craziness.

5434
04:05:40,960 --> 04:05:42,860
Um, oh, yeah, they...

5435
04:05:46,150 --> 04:05:48,370
That was so fun.

5436
04:05:49,290 --> 04:05:50,490
Thank you, guys.

5437
04:05:51,370 --> 04:05:52,950
My brain is mushed.

5438
04:05:55,590 --> 04:05:57,450
My brain is mush.

5439
04:05:59,190 --> 04:05:59,990
Mush, mush, mush.

5440
04:06:05,790 --> 04:06:06,870
We love chaos.

5441
04:06:07,070 --> 04:06:08,670
Tomorrow will be a little less chaos.

5442
04:06:09,470 --> 04:06:10,350
Sexy chaos.

5443
04:06:10,670 --> 04:06:11,430
Sexy chaos.

5444
04:06:11,670 --> 04:06:12,770
Just came from Henya's dream.

5445
04:06:13,090 --> 04:06:14,090
More collabs.

5446
04:06:15,690 --> 04:06:17,210
Thanks for dropping by.

5447
04:06:17,430 --> 04:06:18,170
Thank you.

5448
04:06:20,050 --> 04:06:23,750
I see you also recommend look up this video if you want to
see her play Ace Combat 7.

5449
04:06:23,870 --> 04:06:25,150
She did PvP with one of the devs.

5450
04:06:26,450 --> 04:06:27,690
I will watch it.

5451
04:06:28,750 --> 04:06:30,010
She also really loves Gundam.

5452
04:06:30,930 --> 04:06:38,910
So, um, actually I forgot to tell her the last because the
last time I saw her I wanted to tell her to play Metal Gear.

5453
04:06:40,790 --> 04:06:44,730
I think she would really like Metal Gear so I want to tell
her to play it if she hasn't already.

5454
04:06:45,850 --> 04:06:48,750
It's not Mecha, but it's kind of...

5455
04:06:48,750 --> 04:06:51,730
I mean, Ace Combat's not Mecha either, but you know.

5456
04:06:52,250 --> 04:06:55,390
She's also like a Gundam ambassador though, so she's so
awesome.

5457
04:06:55,750 --> 04:06:57,810
She's so She's so perfect.

5458
04:06:57,970 --> 04:06:58,530
She's so cute.

5459
04:06:59,150 --> 04:07:00,710
I love, I love my Oshis.

5460
04:07:04,130 --> 04:07:06,750
The gift subs sure do clog up the dono notice.

5461
04:07:07,090 --> 04:07:07,550
They do.

5462
04:07:09,830 --> 04:07:11,010
I don't think I can turn them.

5463
04:07:11,130 --> 04:07:13,070
I don't know if I can turn them off, to be honest.

5464
04:07:16,880 --> 04:07:17,760
But, you know.

5465
04:07:20,800 --> 04:07:21,200
Yep.

5466
04:07:21,840 --> 04:07:22,240
Okie dokie.

5467
04:07:22,600 --> 04:07:23,540
I'm going to bed now.

5468
04:07:24,220 --> 04:07:24,960
Thank you guys.

5469
04:07:25,080 --> 04:07:26,860
Oh, I see your stream labs, Rico.

5470
04:07:28,540 --> 04:07:33,220
Consider investing in the laser guard dog rover and the more
taller sentry.

5471
04:07:33,800 --> 04:07:36,640
They make everything much easier by clearing a lot of the
trash for you.

5472
04:07:37,080 --> 04:07:38,020
We'll look into it.

5473
04:07:38,360 --> 04:07:38,840
Thank you.

5474
04:07:41,500 --> 04:07:42,740
Oh, my chat just disconnected.

5475
04:07:44,320 --> 04:07:46,080
I wonder if there's a way, though, I can turn off.

5476
04:07:46,360 --> 04:07:48,500
Because, you know, we don't need to see every... Oh!

5477
04:07:49,700 --> 04:07:49,920
Huh?

5478
04:07:51,680 --> 04:07:52,240
Uh-oh.

5479
04:07:54,500 --> 04:07:55,380
Uh-oh.

5480
04:07:55,920 --> 04:07:57,460
Wait, am I... I'm still streaming... Uh-oh.

5481
04:08:01,370 --> 04:08:02,390
Uh-oh.

5482
04:08:04,810 --> 04:08:06,070
Uh-oh.

5483
04:08:14,100 --> 04:08:15,100
Thank you, Seymour.

5484
04:08:16,560 --> 04:08:17,100
Uh.

5485
04:08:18,600 --> 04:08:19,280
So...

5486
04:08:19,940 --> 04:08:22,520
I don't know if I can end the stream.

5487
04:08:23,200 --> 04:08:24,940
Because I don't remember my password.

5488
04:08:26,760 --> 04:08:27,440
Uh.

5489
04:08:28,020 --> 04:08:30,020
It's asking me to verify my account.

5490
04:08:30,100 --> 04:08:31,200
I don't remember my password.

5491
04:08:32,580 --> 04:08:32,980
Um.

5492
04:08:34,940 --> 04:08:35,620
Hmm.

5493
04:08:35,620 --> 04:08:38,280
Hmm.

5494
04:08:43,480 --> 04:08:44,000
Uh, hmm.

5495
04:08:56,850 --> 04:08:57,370
Wait.

5496
04:08:59,330 --> 04:09:00,190
Uh.

5497
04:09:06,500 --> 04:09:09,780
Their password was changed 21 days ago.

5498
04:09:15,870 --> 04:09:15,950
Uh.

5499
04:09:25,100 --> 04:09:27,340
Deleting system there.

5500
04:09:27,360 --> 04:09:29,360
Dude, I don't know.

5501
04:09:39,940 --> 04:09:41,620
Forgot password.

5502
04:09:47,980 --> 04:09:49,840
Text means recovery number.

5503
04:09:55,500 --> 04:09:56,460
Oh, there it is.

5504
04:09:59,520 --> 04:10:01,560
This is awkward, isn't it?

5505
04:10:03,400 --> 04:10:04,740
This sure is awkward.

5506
04:10:07,700 --> 04:10:11,500
Uh, oh yeah, I can, yeah, get the code.

5507
04:10:12,720 --> 04:10:20,120
Um, anyway, um, what do you, uh, um, what do you guys eat
for dinner?

5508
04:10:20,520 --> 04:10:27,140
If it's, if it's not dinner, what do you eat for, um, for
breakfast?

5509
04:10:31,240 --> 04:10:38,300
Taco Bell, burger, chicken, chicken, wing, beef, chicken,
chicken, chicken.

5510
04:10:38,780 --> 04:10:39,280
Pizza.

5511
04:10:40,180 --> 04:10:41,180
It's not even Friday.

5512
04:10:42,000 --> 04:10:43,220
Okay, update password.

5513
04:10:44,460 --> 04:10:46,780
You can update your password now if you forgot it.

5514
04:10:55,870 --> 04:10:56,730
Save password.

5515
04:10:58,030 --> 04:10:58,890
Change password.

5516
04:10:59,470 --> 04:11:02,430
Oh wait, it just locked me out or just kicked me out of
my...

5517
04:11:06,160 --> 04:11:07,060
Oh my god.

5518
04:11:07,260 --> 04:11:07,440
Wait.

5519
04:11:08,100 --> 04:11:09,360
This is so complicated.

5520
04:11:15,220 --> 04:11:15,520
Okay.

5521
04:11:17,620 --> 04:11:18,180
Save.

5522
04:11:19,760 --> 04:11:20,260
Thanks.

5523
04:11:24,160 --> 04:11:26,580
Okay, what was I doing?

5524
04:11:26,780 --> 04:11:30,180
Oh, I was signing into YouTube to end my stream.

5525
04:11:33,560 --> 04:11:35,960
I'm going to end my stream now.

5526
04:11:37,660 --> 04:11:41,640
Thank you guys for hanging out today.

5527
04:11:43,860 --> 04:11:44,740

04:11:46,500 --> 04:11:48,440
Thank you guys for hanging out.

5529
04:11:49,020 --> 04:11:52,880
I hope you enjoyed.
