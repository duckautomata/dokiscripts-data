1
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,020
You've heard of it, haven't you?

2
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,360
The legend of Sparta?

3
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,200
When I was young, my father would tell me stories about it.

4
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,360
Long ago, in ancient times, a demon rebelled against his own kind for the sake of the human race.

5
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:59,380
With his sword, he shut the portal to the demonic realm and sealed the evil entities off from our human world.

6
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,820
But since he was a demon himself, his power was also trapped on the other side.

7
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
I never believed it.

8
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,620
I thought it was just a child's fairytale.

9
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,400
But I discovered that this so-called legend wasn't a myth at all.

10
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,140
Sparta existed.

11
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,460
How do I know?

12
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,660
Well, I met the sons of Sparta.

13
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,240
Both of them.

14
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:35,740
Though the same blood of their father flowed through their veins, Sorry, we're gonna watch the intro every time, you guys.

15
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,320
They're sadists.

16
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,880
Going in for the brotherly hug.

17
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,540
It's sharper than I remember.

18
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,860
Just bros crossing swords.

19
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,920
Probably a thing every brother does.

20
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,500
Oh my god!

21
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,960
It's the strong kid.

22
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,980
Like, what hair gel does he use?

23
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,920
The rain is made of hair gel.

24
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,640
You think they always wanted a brother.

25
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,380
Oh my gosh, it's my brain rot.

26
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm sorry.

27
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
I can't stop saying that.

28
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,120
A brother.

29
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,060
If you don't follow me on Twitter...

30
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:05,780
Basically, a couple months ago I learned of the Mufasa trailer and there was two lines in it.

31
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,800
Where he goes, I always wanted a brother.

32
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,940
And then he says it again.

33
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,100
I always wanted a brother.

34
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,880
Last night... Wait, hold on.

35
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,120
How do I stop the...

36
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,620
Stop it.

37
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,080
Stop it.

38
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,500
Oh, there we go.

39
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,220
Just go to load game.

40
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,840
I was scared for a second.

41
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,620
Last night I learned that it's from a song.

42
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:40,020
I learned that it's from a song in the new Mufasa movie.

43
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,400
But I can't stop saying it.

44
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,600
They say it six times.

45
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,900
So many times.

46
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,540
I'm gonna sing it in the next carry on.

47
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,040
The rest of the song is so cute.

48
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,820
And then you get to... It's like...

49
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,880
It sounds so Lion King.

50
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,000
It sounds so cute.

51
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,040
And then you just hit the wall and it's...

52
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,320
I always wanted a brother.

53
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,200
Just like you.

54
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,040
I always wanted a brother.

55
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,660
I've been like torturing my cats with it.

56
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,340
Like the paws.

57
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,300
You know, with like Butaro and everything.

58
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll be like...

59
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,600
Hey paws, did you always want a brother?

60
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,940
They say that.

61
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,600
They just are so... I can't...

62
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,420
I can't stop saying it.

63
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,560
It comes from deep within.

64
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,720
I always wanted a brother.

65
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,480
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:45,580
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,440
I can't stop saying it.

68
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,740
I think I found a new karaoke request.

69
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,860
But like I said, the rest of the song is so cute.

70
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,940
They're like...

71
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,020
Hey, did your mama say you can't stay out this late?

72
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,920
Hey, did your father say...

73
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,940
I don't know the words.

74
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,080
I only know I always wanted a brother.

75
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,020
I can't stop saying it.

76
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,380
I wish I was home to play DMC3 too.

77
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,760
Have fun!

78
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,020
Make sure not to get a tummy ache from anger.

79
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,300
These voices are tough.

80
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,540
Thank you!

81
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,360
It's okay if I have tummy ache.

82
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,900
I have tummy medicine.

83
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,360
I have tummy medicine.

84
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,020
Minto is a 45 year old single mom who's single-handedly funding Mufasa's box office.

85
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,760
I haven't even gone and seen it.

86
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,960
What are you talking about?

87
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,400
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted thank you!

88
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,170
Oh, because we were watching the intro I forgot to say...

89
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,040
My throat is a little hoarse today.

90
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,980
That was supposed to be me neighing because it's a hoarse.

91
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,200
Hopefully it will be okay for tomorrow.

92
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,820
Merry Mintmas!

93
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,560
Have some gifts!

94
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,880
Thank you, Solidus!

95
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,080
I'm sure you guys can tell a little bit.

96
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,820
How did a horse get in here?

97
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,280
A little horse.

98
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,100
Oh, Solidus!

99
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,460
Thank you for the 20 gifts!

100
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,880
Thank you!

101
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,780
Also, I was thinking earlier.

102
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,200
I was like, man...

103
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,920
I wish there was something I could wear on my head for Devil May Cry.

104
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,940
Like I get to wear the headband for Metal Gear.

105
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,640
I was like, I wish there was something I could wear on my head.

106
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,960
Like, you know, Dante doesn't really have anything and I don't have a coat or anything to wear.

107
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,600
But then I was like, wait, watch this.

108
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,440
Watch my face, watch my face, watch my face, watch my face.

109
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,080
Seriously?

110
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,260
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

111
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Watch, watch, watch, watch.

112
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,900
I, I can have emo bangs!

113
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,940
I can have emo bangs when I play!

114
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,140
It's so perfect!

115
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,820
Yeah, I'm emo.

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,940
Oh, not a phase.

117
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,880
Oh, what was that song that Fauna and Mume came out with recently?

118
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,640
So good.

119
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,140
Watch Transformers 1 instead.

120
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,880
Same plot, but better in every way.

121
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,340
Please, Minky, I'm going to pass away.

122
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,060
Doomed robot.

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,700
I don't know the last time I've been to the movie theater.

124
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,440
But everybody was talking about the Transformers movie.

125
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,600
How good it was.

126
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,220
At least from what I saw on my timeline.

127
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,940
And everybody's now talking about Sonic 3, right?

128
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

129
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,660
Apparently that was very good.

130
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,480
Speaking of movies, I saw Sonic 3 on Thursday.

131
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,960
It was so good I cried in the theater.

132
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,040
My childhood has officially been made and I can't believe it.

133
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,440
Oh gosh, Sonic fans.

134
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,340
Sonic fans have been through it.

135
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,680
You guys started so strong.

136
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,100
It was so cool to be a Sonic fan back in the day.

137
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,680
And then it hit the lowest point.

138
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,140
It was so bad and everything was just so low.

139
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,220
How do we recover from here?

140
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,260
But then, you rose up.

141
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,500
Sonic fans, Sonic fandom rose up.

142
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
It's so good.

143
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,040
It's now cool to like Sonic again.

144
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,040
Thank you for the 30 gifted.

145
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,140
Minto, if your soul becomes a devil arm slash weapon for Dante or some other devil hunter to use, what would it be?

146
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Probably like...

147
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,440
You do the Moe Moe Q.

148
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,840
You make the heart with your hands and it shoots like a real Moe Moe beam.

149
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,900
And it's just ultra powerful.

150
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,900
Probably.

151
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,100
I don't have a lot, but here's a small Mintimus present.

152
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,420
Thank you!

153
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,260
Thank you!

154
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,180
Known for BS.

155
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,800
Thank you for the pink.

156
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,520
Gotta get prepped for Christmas plus also work tonight going into the morning.

157
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,220
Here's a small gift for Christmas.

158
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,580
Huge props for the amazing year you've had and here's to an even better 2025.

159
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,960
Thank you!

160
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,680
Thank you for the 10 gifted also.

161
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,260
Oh my gosh, you guys are sending so much.

162
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,680
Thank you!

163
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,420
I'll be celebrating Christmas on the 24th.

164
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,600
Let's go!

165
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,480
Merry Christmas.

166
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,760
Happy holidays everybody.

167
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,220
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

168
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,040
Merry Chrysler.

169
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,780
Well then I'll be doing karaoke.

170
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,280
I feel like I mostly celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve too.

171
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,420
I feel like, you know...

172
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,380
I feel like that's how I do things also.

173
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,560
Sorry Minto, she doesn't need to wear anything because her hair is already white like Dante.

174
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,320
And also emo.

175
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,920
Do it to avoid traffic.

176
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,840
No, I don't know what it is.

177
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,060
I feel like...

178
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,180
Christmas feels like one of those holidays where the lead up is more exciting than the actual day.

179
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,780
Or maybe I feel that way as an adult.

180
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,740
But as a kid obviously Christmas day was like so awesome.

181
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,420
But there's also just that fun anticipation.

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,740
Even as a kid being like...

183
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,740
Every day like...

184
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,080
You know, you're just kind of...

185
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,700
And then the day comes and it all happens in a flash and then it's over.

186
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,960
But the anticipation is really I feel what makes it so exciting and so much fun.

187
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,480
Maybe.

188
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,260
Back when Santa was real.

189
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,780
He's still real.

190
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,040
He is real.

191
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,900
What are you talking about?

192
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,860
That's just most seasonal holidays I feel.

193
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,460
The month leading up to Halloween is better than the day itself I think.

194
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,780
I was going to include Halloween also but actually...

195
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,280
I like Halloween so much still.

196
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,440
Even Halloween night.

197
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:26,440
But it is that thing where it's just like the added anticipation, the added seasonal cheer always...

198
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,960
Makes the holiday more exciting I feel.

199
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,040
Down here the tradition is to have a family dinner and party on Christmas eve and then Christmas is just a chill day.

200
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,420
And you know what?

201
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,940
Whatever gives you a day off of work is a great day!

202
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,980
So hopefully you guys have some days off of work.

203
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,040
And you can relax this week.

204
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,240
And also next week?

205
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,340
Is it next week?

206
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,660
Yeah, next week is New Year!

207
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,940
And yeah!

208
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,160
I know some people have to work though.

209
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,440
If you have to work during this time...

210
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,600
Good luck!

211
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,360
Ganbare!

212
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,340
Fighto!

213
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,400
I don't have any plans though for New Year's.

214
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,160
I'll be in Japan.

215
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,200
Not sure what to do yet.

216
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,040
To be honest.

217
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,400
Hello Minto, hope you're having a good day today and ready to get gooder.

218
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,960
I'm ready to get greater!

219
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,600
Thank you!

220
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,400
I don't know what to do.

221
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,400
Maybe I'll find some...

222
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,000
Some type of shrine I can go haunt.

223
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,220
And do my first shrine visit.

224
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,120
Maybe.

225
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,620
I don't know.

226
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,040
Mogura gonna be popping on New Year's.

227
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,760
Oh yeah!

228
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,580
I'll be honest, I've never been.

229
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,460
Mogura is not very big.

230
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,780
It's very very tiny in there.

231
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,980
So it's also very difficult.

232
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,680
I think tickets already sold out.

233
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,700
But I mean, I can probably find a way in.

234
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,400
But I'm also just like...

235
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,760
I don't know if I wanna be packed with people.

236
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,700
New Year's Eve is my birthday!

237
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,480
Turning 32!

238
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,840
Kamen Dachi!

239
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,300
Wait, can I sing you happy birthday now?

240
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,360
Because I won't be around.

241
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,940
Happy birthday to you!

242
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,160
Happy birthday to you!

243
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,020
Happy birthday dear Kamen Dachi!

244
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,020
Happy birthday to you!

245
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,500
Happy birthday!

246
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,340
And this is for all the birthdays that I will miss while I'm gone.

247
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,840
This is to all of you!

248
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,500
That I will miss singing your birthday while I'm away.

249
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,400
Happy birthday to you!

250
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,620
Happy birthday to you!

251
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,540
Happy birthday and happy new year!

252
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,280
Happy birthday to you!

253
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,980
Yes you!

254
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,860
You right there!

255
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,800
You!

256
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,540
Yeah!

257
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,320
Happy birthday everybody!

258
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,620
Happy birthday to Earth!

259
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,760
Whose birthday will be turning 2025.

260
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,740
Me?

261
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,860
Yeah you!

262
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,640
Earth?

263
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,780
Yeah, happy birthday to Earth on the new year!

264
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,500
Yeah, Earth didn't exist before the first year.

265
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,500
Duh.

266
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,060
Duh.

267
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,900
That's not how old the Earth is.

268
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,500
It is according to the calendar.

269
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,480
The calendar says 2020.

270
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,020
You think the calendar is going to lie?

271
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,900
You think that they just skipped a billion years or anything?

272
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,220
That would be so silly!

273
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,360
What the...

274
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,240
Why would you do that?

275
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,620
Thanks for the happy birthday!

276
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,080
Mine is in precisely one week on the 30th.

277
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,420
We are already in Delta!

278
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,220
Happy birthday!

279
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,100
Your best bit yet.

280
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,920
It's already 2025?

281
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,840
Not yet!

282
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,580
Not yet.

283
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,300
Next week.

284
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,360
Koyu-chan!

285
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:43,480
What are you doing in Japan on the new year?

286
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
I'm free.

287
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,020
I have no plan.

288
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,960
Early Merry Christmas and mint bullet pies!

289
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,640
Thank you!

290
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,180
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

291
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,300
Merry early Christmas

292
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,080
I am going to play a game.

293
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't know how long I'll go for today.

294
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,240
We'll see how I feel.

295
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,120
I'm a little bit tired just because I did some errands today.

296
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,800
Because I had to get ready for my trip.

297
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,780
I needed to pick some things up.

298
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,900
But overall I'm feeling good.

299
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,080
No way.

300
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,920
11-12?

301
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,100
No.

302
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,340
12... Has it...

303
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,940
Has it really... It has not been a month since I last played this game.

304
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,540
It must be December 11th, right?

305
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,360
Day, month.

306
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:58,640
OK.

307
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,940
I was going to say...

308
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,220
There is no way.

309
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,960
That confused me for a second.

310
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,900
I was like, what?

311
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,240
It was a European day.

312
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:07,620
OK.

313
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,580
I was going to be like...

314
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,540
There is no way.

315
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,480
Last time though the fight was so fun with the swords guys.

316
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,900
I loved that one.

317
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,540
We are on mission... We just cleared mission 5.

318
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,100
Maybe we'll get through a few missions.

319
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,200
I say maybe.

320
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,520
I mean I hope so.

321
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,720
I hope we'll get through a few missions today.

322
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,940
Taking it at my own minto pace.

323
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,280
So that...

324
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,060
Day, month, year always made more sense than month, day, year.

325
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,300
You're right.

326
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,580
I agree with you.

327
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:53,040
But my freedom brain has been taught otherwise.

328
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,420
So of course it's the first thing I think of.

329
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,820
America.

330
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,960
Anyway...

331
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,080
This

332
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,570
face.

333
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,610
What are these?

334
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,310
Demo Digest, Total Ranking, Bloody Palace, Co-op?

335
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,670
I can co-op.

336
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,190
There is multiplayer in this game?

337
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,770
Bloody Palace is too hard for you.

338
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,530
Don't doubt my limits.

339
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,750
It's like a 104 gauntlet.

340
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,710
I definitely don't want to do that.

341
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,870
I don't want to do it.

342
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,930
It's not that I can't.

343
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,130
I just don't want to.

344
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,670
That's all.

345
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,720
I could totally do it if I felt like it.

346
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,660
I just don't feel like it.

347
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,560
Duh!

348
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,500
Lady!

349
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,730
Wait, I think we saw this cutscene last time.

350
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,530
I watched it.

351
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,050
Right before I ended.

352
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,990
Oh, yeah, girl!

353
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,170
Look at her.

354
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,130
She's so sassy.

355
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:34,770
She looks... The heterochromia and the hairstyle look so much like Final Fantasy X-2, you know?

356
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,080
And the guns.

357
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,980
She's just Yuna.

358
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,080
She really is.

359
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,590
Why don't we have more heterochromia anymore?

360
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,110
When are you streaming X-2?

361
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,730
Streaming Final Fantasy games.

362
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,150
Do you want an actual game that will take a year?

363
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,170
And 6.

364
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,970
Mission 6, Family Ties.

365
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,650
Clear the trial and forge a new path.

366
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,410
What do we have here anyway?

367
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,230
I don't know how many robes I've got or anything.

368
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,570
The demo digest shows how scenes like this one were filmed using motion capture.

369
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,310
It's really fun to watch, but contains spoilers.

370
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:41,990
Thank you, Nicholas.

371
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,450
Thank you for telling me it contains spoilers.

372
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,770
Otherwise I would have been like, let's watch it.

373
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,750
We got Agni and Rudra.

374
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,390
Girls with Homophobia.

375
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,310
Stop it!

376
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,730
Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PC.

377
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,430
Yes, we are getting it on PC.

378
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,950
Kaitlin.

379
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,150
I don't remember if I used this.

380
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,930
I have 7000 robes.

381
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:15,350
Nice.

382
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:17,710
Okay.

383
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,590
I'm just gonna go in and try to remember how to play.

384
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,450
The Goddess's Chamber.

385
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,010
I don't remember how to play.

386
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,010
Oh, this is gun.

387
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,190
This is attack.

388
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,330
Hold on.

389
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,790
Is it under status?

390
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,790
Status or...

391
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,170
Oh no, this area.

392
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,510
I feel like you guys say that about everywhere.

393
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,410
Control.

394
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,270
Let me just see.

395
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,870
Change the button setting.

396
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,190
No.

397
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,490
Wait, I want to...

398
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,590
Status file.

399
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,250
Thank you.

400
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,670
I knew it was under status.

401
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,190
I knew I was in the right place.

402
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,210
Oh, I knew it.

403
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:27,470
All the American traditions of tracking and calculating come from old colonial English.

404
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:32,190
But when they changed to newer formats, America was grandfathered in and became the odd one out.

405
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,390
Silly.

406
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,450
Too stubborn to change.

407
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,650
Okay, Devil Arms.

408
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,890
I just wanted a thing that would be like, points to A button.

409
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,170
A button does this.

410
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,590
Points to B button.

411
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,010
B button does this.

412
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:51,550
You know?

413
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,410
Let's see.

414
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,320
Is there nothing, anything like that?

415
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,520
It's not even telling me.

416
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,040
Oh, here we go.

417
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,360
L and A.

418
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:22,960
Okay.

419
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,080
Okay.

420
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,180
Okay, it's just this kind of stuff.

421
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,320
And then you press A...

422
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,800
Oh, sorry.

423
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,060
No.

424
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,120
Not A.

425
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,720
You press... I was reading.

426
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,240
Press A.

427
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,080
You, um...

428
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,520
Press the...

429
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,440
The... Hold on.

430
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,320
I'm sorry.

431
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,140
I'm learning.

432
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,480
There we go.

433
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,200
Okay, okay.

434
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:49,940
Okay, okay.

435
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,380
And this is like... So A is whatever thing's special.

436
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,960
I remember.

437
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,440
Okay, they're a trick.

438
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,660
And then this is a normal attack.

439
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,700
This is a gun attack.

440
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,500
This is a jump.

441
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,560
This is to lock on.

442
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,180
Okay.

443
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,640
A is style.

444
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,800
What's this?

445
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,620
The goddess statue's piercing stare is focused on the front door.

446
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,540
Oh, that's a man!

447
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,820
I thought it was just a big old gloopy.

448
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,880
I thought it was just a bunch of gloop.

449
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,620
There's a guy there.

450
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,540
Wreckage is obstructing the path.

451
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,480
You can't go any further.

452
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,240
Says you.

453
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,000
Okay.

454
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,400
And then over there...

455
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,420
Is an invisible wall.

456
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,020
This room is kind of spooky.

457
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,840
Chamber of three trials.

458
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,120
What is this?

459
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,320
Passing?

460
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,380
What is man but a big old gloop?

461
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,280
It's true!

462
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,660
Passing one trial still shows lacking.

463
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,740
Passing two trials expands horizons.

464
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,900
Passing all trials unlocks one's true potential.

465
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,260
What's this one?

466
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,940
Your wisdom will be put to the test in the chamber ahead.

467
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,280
Use your lifetime experience.

468
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,560
From the crawling infant...

469
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,280
I have to remember when I was a baby?

470
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,340
Oh god.

471
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,540
From the crawling infant to the man standing tall and finally to the old man leaning on his cane.

472
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,640
Okay, so I have to use my smarts here.

473
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,560
Your technique will be put to the test in the chamber ahead.

474
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,080
Overcome the onslaught of obstacles to guarantee your future.

475
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,300
Green.

476
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,440
Green women.

477
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,300
Your warrior's heart will be put to the test in the chamber ahead.

478
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,860
Light all the crests to suppress the evil spirit's rage.

479
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,840
That's me!

480
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,240
Okay, let's go do the smarts first.

481
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,920
Trial of wisdom.

482
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,510
From when I'm a baby.

483
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,820
Oh gosh.

484
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,580
I'm gonna have to remember how to freaking play this game.

485
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,020
Why are there so many guys?

486
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,380
Oh wait, wait, wait.

487
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,080
These are the guys that split, is it not?

488
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,020
Oh no!

489
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:54,840
Wait!

490
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
Don't these guys split?

491
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,240
Oh no, no.

492
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,060
Oh no.

493
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,660
I don't remember what to do.

494
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,060
Wait, how do I...

495
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,670
Thank you.

496
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,270
Ouch!

497
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,050
Oh, I'm gonna die.

498
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,530
I remembered at the... Well, I didn't remember.

499
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,410
You guys helped me.

500
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,110
Thanks.

501
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,210
Thanks.

502
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,310
Oh wait.

503
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,450
This has two.

504
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,090
This has three.

505
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,170
This has four.

506
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,770
Three?

507
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,140
Because of the three try?

508
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,600
Oh wait, because baby, man, old man.

509
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,750
I was wrong.

510
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,480
Was I not thinking?

511
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,270
I thought I was... I thought I was...

512
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,190
I truly thought I...

513
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,110
Oh god.

514
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:03,790
Oh god.

515
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,290
Oh god.

516
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,290
Destroy, destroy, destroy.

517
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,890
Okay, now I can become a sword master.

518
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,890
There we go.

519
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:28,750
Okay.

520
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,670
I did it.

521
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,090
I can leave?

522
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,690
Like you think?

523
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,910
Or are these doors... Are these doors working now?

524
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,810
Gotta restart?

525
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,290
Okay, okay.

526
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,630
I have to restart the trial?

527
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,610
No way.

528
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:04,470
Well, if it's not two and it's not three, it's gotta be four.

529
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:13,630
Two, three, four.

530
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,150
Four is your lucky number.

531
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:22,670
So true!

532
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,990
Spooky.

533
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,080
Why four?

534
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,660
I'm trying to think though.

535
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,600
Why was it four?

536
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,220
Babies crawl at four?

537
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,080
I don't know anything about babies.

538
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,100
Wait, what?

539
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,060
No, they should be walking by then.

540
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,560
Actually a cracked ass gamer.

541
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,840
Are you calling me an ass crack?

542
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,580
Bruce Wayne, I'm gonna expose you.

543
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,320
Everybody, Bruce Wayne is Batman!

544
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:57,970
Okay.

545
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,840
They should be walking by four.

546
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,100
Is it because they use their arms and their legs?

547
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,520
And so they have four... like they are a dog.

548
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,220
And then a man... that's why they brought up the cane.

549
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:25,060
So a man would be standing on his own two legs and then a caned man would have three legs.

550
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,460
And then...

551
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,190
I'll never...

552
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,610
I have the essence of intelligence.

553
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,310
I'll never ever...

554
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,390
Impalpable knowledge of the ancient ones.

555
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,470
After this... oh sorry.

556
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,170
Offer this to the goddess to open a new path.

557
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,610
So I can just leave?

558
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,710
You just killed my whole family, Mint.

559
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,590
I can't believe you've done this to a cracked ass gamer.

560
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,410
Sorry.

561
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:21,750
What do I... it doesn't like... I can just go back in if I felt like it?

562
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,770
But I took the...

563
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,810
I do not want to go back in.

564
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:28,090
No!

565
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:38,870
This one is the... oh gosh.

566
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,210
Wait, what's technique?

567
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,410
Oh, yes.

568
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,210
Trial of skill.

569
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:55,690
You guys, if I fail this you can truly say skill issue.

570
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,750
You know?

571
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,150
You can say skill issue.

572
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,410
Gun, trick, sword.

573
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,960
I think I will want to be a trickster for this.

574
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,260
How do you dodge this one?

575
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,380
How do you dodge that?

576
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,320
The one that comes up from above.

577
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,560
Oh, you can walk under it?

578
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,300
Oh, for real?

579
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,570
I made it.

580
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,010
Essence of technique.

581
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,490
Masterful techniques of the ancient ones.

582
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,430
Offer this to the goddess to open a new path.

583
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,290
No way.

584
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,810
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

585
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:24,790
Why?

586
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:24,910
Why?

587
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,110
You couldn't just let me be?

588
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,840
Run over, sword, sword.

589
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,380
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

590
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,820
Oh, ouch.

591
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,580
Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it.

592
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,680
Crazy.

593
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,560
Oh, there is more.

594
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,420
Take it, take it, take it, take it.

595
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,280
He's already dead, but I won't let him die.

596
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,140
I won't let him die.

597
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,500
He's already dead, but he's mine forever.

598
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,810
Ten thousand stab wounds.

599
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,750
Yeah, we did that.

600
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,410
OK, and then this one was...

601
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,490
Our heart will be put to the test.

602
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:24,090
Light all of the crests to suppress the evil spirit's rage.

603
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,670
Good job, welcome to my bishop.

604
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,170
Thank you.

605
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,320
You don't have to do the third trial?

606
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,220
Oh no, wait, really?

607
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,670
Wait, this one is optional.

608
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,350
It's the hardest one.

609
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:45,930
You should.

610
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,630
There is a reward.

611
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,930
There is a weapon if you do.

612
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,590
How difficult are we saying?

613
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,990
This is the hardest one.

614
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,310
The reward sucks.

615
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,390
There is a neat reward.

616
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,730
It's not worth trying to find out.

617
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,510
Let's try it.

618
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,210
We can try it.

619
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,520
What am I lighting up?

620
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,580
I hate the inverse camera.

621
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,100
Oh, this thing.

622
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
What's wrong with them?

623
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,180
Oh god, they're scaring me.

624
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,260
Can I kill these guys or no?

625
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,350
What if I just...

626
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,570
And right

627
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,440
away...

628
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,220
And I hit, hit, hit...

629
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:06,980
There

630
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:21,830
is more?

631
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,760
Oh god, I tried to move.

632
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,780
Oh gosh.

633
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,940
I don't remember how to dodge stuff, to be honest.

634
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,240
Oh no, wait...

635
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,560
Which one?

636
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,720
Oh my god.

637
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,350
The music is kind of awesome though.

638
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,990
Wait, oh no, the next one.

639
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,560
Oh my god.

640
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,760
Wait, he's purple.

641
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,800
Is there another one?

642
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,440
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

643
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,380
He's tricky.

644
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,040
He's a tough guy.

645
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,380
You wanna be a tough guy, get it?

646
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,600
Nice.

647
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,280
Two birds with one stone, baby.

648
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,720
Oh my god, again?

649
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,140
Kill, kill, kill, kill!

650
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,560
Nice.

651
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,420
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

652
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,440
I'm gonna...

653
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,780
Oh man.

654
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,270
Right when...

655
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,210
Right when...

656
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,870
Right when I got the grorb.

657
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,850
Right in front of the health, so sad.

658
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,730
Million stab is too slow, but good first try.

659
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:13,630
I'll be honest, I just hit the X button a whole lot.

660
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,730
I just hit the buttons...

661
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,020
How much money do I got?

662
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,500
Is there something that I was trying to get?

663
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,340
I can't remember.

664
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,230
I can't remember.

665
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,050
Maybe I was saving up for a thing or two.

666
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,350
Air hike on...

667
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,310
What even is the jet stream?

668
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,610
R, L while holding X.

669
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,970
R while holding X.

670
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,250
Oh, I'm not even using it.

671
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:26,990
I don't even have them equipped.

672
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:27,690
I'm stupid.

673
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,250
I'm dumb.

674
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:32,350
It's like Stinger.

675
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,830
How do you switch?

676
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:40,470
Wait.

677
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,310
I don't remember.

678
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,130
I remember, I remember.

679
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:50,990
I'm walking.

680
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,510
I remembered.

681
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,900
Essence of technique.

682
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,480
Nothing happened.

683
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,340
Essence of intelligence.

684
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,670
The battle theme is called Taste the Blood.

685
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,270
The lyrics have two meanings.

686
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,550
It either means the enemy is weak or the player is stinky.

687
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,670
It's almost like a roast song.

688
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,330
That's so funny.

689
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:31,850
I don't know.

690
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,310
I'm just gonna keep going guys.

691
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:48,610
Is this one of those guys that I have to do like a...

692
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:53,570
Do the combo to?

693
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:56,610
Oh yeah, he's losing it.

694
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:57,550
He's losing it.

695
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,590
Oh, no.

696
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,610
Hold on, let me...

697
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,360
Gales and flame.

698
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:48,790
I lost it!

699
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,780
I'm like trying to jump, but it's like because of the camera angle it's making me dodge.

700
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,570
I'm not good at it.

701
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:27,610
That would have been awesome if I had...

702
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,800
I did it.

703
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,880
Blue orb fragment.

704
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,220
He was trying to tell me.

705
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,400
I just kept beating him up.

706
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,060
Lady!

707
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:27,820
Oh no!

708
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,060
Papa?

709
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,700
Why do you say it like that?

710
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,800
Only I say it like that.

711
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,320
Only I say it like that.

712
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,560
Papa?

713
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,300
Oh no!

714
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,280
They have the same...

715
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,200
What a jerk!

716
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,800
Oh my god, lady!

717
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,100
The book.

718
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,680
Throwing the book at her face is insane.

719
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,880
Yay, mission clear!

720
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,000
We got an A on orbs though.

721
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,660
Don't worry about it.

722
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,640
Dads.

723
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,740
And we just met the dad.

724
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,620
It was all according to plan.

725
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,620
Dads.

726
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,470
Minto got the dump truck.

727
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:53,370
Every wisp knows this tbh.

728
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:54,770
What do you mean by that?

729
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,710
What prompted you to say this?

730
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,450
What prompted you to say that?

731
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,250
It's okay if I messed up.

732
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:09,530
Don't worry about it.

733
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,010
Behold Dante's wrist.

734
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:17,230
Well, this is my kind of rain.

735
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,530
No wonder the sky looks so funny today.

736
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:21,770
Let me go!

737
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,210
Let you go?

738
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:25,290
It's rain and women.

739
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,710
But it would be a waste if you ended up as just a pretty stain.

740
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,010
Oh my god!

741
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,670
Last of all, happy birthday!

742
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:43,570
Here I am trying to help you.

743
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:45,490
And you show your thanks by shooting me?

744
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,490
Twice!

745
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,170
No Dante, fight harder.

746
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:59,850
She is so hot.

747
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:02,030
So he is a demon too.

748
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,870
I'm beginning to think I've got rotten luck with women.

749
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,010
Oh I missed the 7!

750
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:17,530
I didn't see it.

751
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,830
I didn't see it guys, dang it.

752
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:24,870
Where was it?

753
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:26,690
The blood stain.

754
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,330
I'm tired of holding back.

755
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,250
Master Walt!

756
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,970
Happy birthday to you!

757
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:40,530
Happy birthday to you!

758
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,330
Happy birthday Master Walt!

759
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,870
Happy birthday to you!

760
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,310
Happy birthday!

761
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:51,870
OK.

762
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,130
A chance meeting.

763
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,210
Duel of the demon children.

764
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,210
Let's go.

765
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,990
We are in a dark corridor.

766
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:05,110
That's where it was.

767
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:05,910
The 7.

768
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:13,470
Heaven rise chamber.

769
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,450
That's a lot of roars.

770
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:20,250
Just saying.

771
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,150
The mat worst she can say is no.

772
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:27,910
Or literally shoots me in the head.

773
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:31,510
Yes, but...

774
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:32,850
OK.

775
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:36,110
Hold on.

776
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,070
We'll come back here.

777
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,090
Where did you see a blorb?

778
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:47,890
Nice.

779
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,550
There is a lot in here.

780
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,110
Oh my goodness.

781
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:57,210
Please!

782
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:07,510
Remember you can move the camera.

783
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:10,490
Not here.

784
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,670
Not here.

785
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:18,270
Don't forget your wall run.

786
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:18,890
Oh!

787
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:21,990
Thank you.

788
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:22,770
Wait.

789
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,730
Wall jump or wall run?

790
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,370
Style button.

791
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,870
I don't go up high enough though.

792
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:49,630
I don't go high enough.

793
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:58,590
I feel maybe...

794
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:01,750
Oh my goodness.

795
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:02,990
I don't think we'll ever get it.

796
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:06,610
It's a sad sad roar world up there.

797
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,510
I'm gonna try... Let me get all the stuff that's in here.

798
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:13,630
Because apparently there is a blorb somewhere.

799
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:16,430
I do not see it though.

800
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:17,770
Boing.

801
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,150
Where is a blorb?

802
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,790
If there is a blorb I'll have it.

803
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,410
I don't see it though.

804
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,250
Blorbless.

805
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:31,290
Oh yeah.

806
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:32,910
So many rorbs.

807
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,510
We are just going higher and higher and higher.

808
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,890
Wait, what if I fall all the way down?

809
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,820
Down is the correct way?

810
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,940
Wait, actually...

811
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,720
I was just trying to collect stuff.

812
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,460
Someone said there was a shiny on the floor.

813
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,380
I think I missed it.

814
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:20,070
It's at the very top.

815
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,920
Thank goodness there is no fall damage.

816
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,800
I think we'd be in trouble.

817
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,240
I think we would have a bad time.

818
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,340
I think.

819
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:38,900
Probably.

820
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,260
Green door!

821
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,600
Pitch black void?

822
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,660
I can clearly see.

823
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,920
What are you talking about?

824
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,380
Who named this place?

825
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,020
I think they need to get their eyes checked.

826
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,400
Oh boy.

827
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,000
More rorbs!

828
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,220
What is this?

829
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,820
Looks like a fancy...

830
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,660
Something I want.

831
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,380
Oh gosh, I'm so lost.

832
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,520
What's the mission?

833
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,520
It's a light?

834
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,820
But it's like helped by him.

835
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:59,000
So they go into defense and then they go into attack.

836
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:12,250
Shiny.

837
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,290
Wait, how do I get this?

838
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:16,310
Shiny.

839
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:17,830
Grab the shiny Dante.

840
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,170
What is this?

841
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:31,590
Stone pillar embroidered with skulls.

842
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:34,630
Similar pillar lies to the right.

843
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:35,790
Something appears to be missing from it.

844
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,210
Why couldn't I pick it up?

845
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:39,630
Hello?

846
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:42,590
Just a vital start.

847
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:43,750
OK.

848
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:45,610
Get me out of here please.

849
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:46,470
Bye!

850
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,340
Your love keeps lifting me higher and higher.

851
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,260
Is that the lyrics?

852
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,930
Am I going to fight a hot lady?

853
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,250
Is she going to come to life?

854
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,970
Oh, come on!

855
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:28,730
Why are there two of them?

856
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:30,210
Oh

857
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,640
my god, are they just making tons of guys?

858
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:02,840
Ouchie!

859
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,120
There

860
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,400
are so many guys.

861
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,540
Easy mode is now selectable.

862
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,260
I already got that achievement.

863
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,300
Sirens.

864
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,060
I definitely read Shrek.

865
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:31,060
The sorrowful shriek of the siren calms even the most ferocious of flames.

866
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,560
I definitely read...

867
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,960
Definitely read Shrek.

868
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,980
Hey yo, what do you mean all these little caskets are...

869
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:49,380
Well, that singular casket was hiding a robe.

870
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,740
All dead people holding out on me, huh?

871
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:01,480
Alrighty!

872
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,800
OK, these don't break.

873
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,340
What's in here?

874
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,340
Lift room.

875
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,800
Yo bro, do you even lift?

876
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,090
What?

877
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:46,370
I don't know if I can get this you guys.

878
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:48,230
I don't think I've ever gotten a triple.

879
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:03,170
Oh no, I lost it!

880
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,270
I was so close.

881
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:07,730
What's that noise?

882
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:11,710
What?

883
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:12,430
Oh, it's the flames.

884
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:13,650
It's the flames coming back.

885
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,030
That scared me.

886
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:20,830
Sword master midair... Wait, what does that mean?

887
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:21,950
You have combos.

888
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:23,330
Wait.

889
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,460
Guys, I don't know...

890
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:11,720
Using the same attack is worthless.

891
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:14,820
Yes...

892
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:16,520
Yes, I...

893
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,500
I know.

894
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,060
I know.

895
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,640
I'm sure she didn't know that.

896
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,260
I hope you're being sarcastic.

897
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,860
But does she know?

898
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,220
I don't know.

899
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:42,400
I don't know.

900
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,540
Wait,

901
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,640
if I do this...

902
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:11,190
This...this...

903
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,290
This...this...this...

904
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:17,190
Wait, this...this...this...

905
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:20,300
This...this...

906
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:25,380
This...this...this...

907
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,620
Just don't use the same attack in a row VTuber!

908
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:49,040
Just don't do the same attack in a row and it works.

909
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:49,500
D'oh!

910
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,860
Just do the same attack.

911
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,900
Just do consistency.

912
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,440
Same attack three times.

913
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,080
And when I jump though...

914
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:12,760
Ok, let's see.

915
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,640
Maybe I can add something into the rotation.

916
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,960
I don't know if you know, but you need to add variety of moves.

917
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,220
Not the same ones in a row.

918
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,680
PSYCHOS!

919
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:24,060
Guys, why couldn't you tell me what PSYCHOS just told me?

920
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:25,960
I didn't know that.

921
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,580
Guys!

922
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,080
That would have helped me so much.

923
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:33,800
No help.

924
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,560
My bad.

925
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,540
Ah, sheesh.

926
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:48,640
Plenty of attacks to try, but ok.

927
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,960
Oh my gosh, Seiren.

928
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,260
No need to get sassy with me, ok?

929
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,320
Ok?

930
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,120
No need to get sassy with me.

931
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,620
So maybe if I...

932
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,680
I was doing a three hit combo, so basically I was doing...

933
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,480
Stinger...up...spin.

934
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:13,420
Stinger...oh, but see I'm pressing forward and it does it just as a normal attack.

935
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:16,940
Stinger...up...spin.

936
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:18,300
Why?

937
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,040
Why does it not do a stinger?

938
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,560
Maybe try...wait, I can't get on this side.

939
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,060
Do normal attacks too?

940
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:29,820
Oh, ok.

941
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:30,860
Normal attacks help?

942
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:31,160
Ok.

943
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,000
Oh

944
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:24,440
shoot.

945
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,980
My finger slipped.

946
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,080
My finger slipped.

947
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:02,440
No!

948
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,000
I had the good pattern!

949
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,000
Hey!

950
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,480
I

951
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,800
don't know why sometimes he jumps up in the air.

952
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:41,840
I'm not pressing jump.

953
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:14,450
I give up.

954
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:15,890
I give up.

955
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:18,250
I give up.

956
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:30,750
That's ok.

957
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:34,050
What was it anyway?

958
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:34,730
What do you get?

959
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:37,530
A dead end?

960
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:43,370
Try this.

961
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:44,830
Oh god.

962
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:48,090
Oh, a blower piece?

963
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:48,750
That's it?

964
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,830
You just get a blower piece?

965
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:53,970
Elevator control panel.

966
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:55,770
There is not enough power to operate it.

967
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,030
I see.

968
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,960
Seems to be an elevator that goes down, but it's not working.

969
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,880
And we know why.

970
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:21,930
The tranquil soul's room.

971
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:28,210
And let's put in this little face.

972
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:31,150
Stone pillar?

973
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:31,250
Stone pillar?

974
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:34,710
Wait, what?

975
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:35,990
The thing that I got.

976
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:36,610
What was that?

977
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:42,990
Wait, what did I receive from the other room?

978
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:47,690
Use it at the main entrance.

979
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:55,130
Where are those guys?

980
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:56,390
Oh, they all left.

981
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:08,550
This is a complete aside to your smoking sexy styling, but your combo noises really make me want to see you play the DMC reboot.

982
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:13,690
Dino Dante's in name only loves to grunt during his combos.

983
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:15,610
Grunt.

984
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:34,060
There were other doors.

985
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:35,100
There were a lot of other doors.

986
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:43,200
I think I jumped a little further down than I wanted to.

987
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,560
Is it to this?

988
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,760
The divine library.

989
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,570
This is not...

990
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:04,590
Oh, it is a combat.

991
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:05,990
But also...oh no.

992
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:07,370
No, I don't want...

993
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:08,470
Wait.

994
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:10,070
Oh shoot.

995
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:13,730
I didn't learn how to defeat these guys.

996
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,070
You'll get it.

997
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:49,130
You'll aim, Dante.

998
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:49,950
Dante.

999
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:51,470
Just a little bit down.

1000
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:52,310
There you go, buddy.

1001
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:54,670
There you go, buddy.

1002
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:57,670
You can't see?

1003
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:59,950
He's coming for me?

1004
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:10,600
Helps if you aim at the enemy.

1005
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,420
It's not me.

1006
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:12,680
It's Dante.

1007
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:15,540
It ain't me.

1008
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,640
It's all Dante, baby.

1009
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:28,360
I'm keeping my distance because these guys kind of scare me.

1010
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,020
I don't know why.

1011
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,860
They kind of freak me out.

1012
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:40,510
Why did you come after me?

1013
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:42,010
I didn't come to you.

1014
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:52,350
I can't use these hecking camera angles.

1015
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:53,110
Ah!

1016
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,920
Sorry for the loud gun.

1017
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,200
Oh my god, it's so loud.

1018
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:17,300
I don't like them.

1019
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:23,600
I just hop really slowly, but there is something about them.

1020
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:26,560
I got...

1021
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,000
That's not a robe.

1022
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,460
A piece of...

1023
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:34,080
Which grants amazing power.

1024
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:36,940
They say it was once used as an energy source.

1025
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:46,790
Anything in here?

1026
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:51,370
This grand library.

1027
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:54,690
I could have just chilled up here.

1028
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:57,110
And attack them.

1029
01:15:57,490 --> 01:15:59,130
Wait, how is that a puzzle?

1030
01:15:59,130 --> 01:15:59,270
Puzzle.

1031
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:03,470
How is that...

1032
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:10,430
The blue door is supposed to be you solve something, is it not?

1033
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:13,830
And then the red doors are you kill all the enemies.

1034
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:15,970
Puzzle.

1035
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:16,490
You

1036
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:28,340
killed the correct amount.

1037
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,140
I see.

1038
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,260
Alright, hold on.

1039
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:33,840
Wait, Dante!

1040
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:34,660
Wait Dante!

1041
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,380
Hold on, there were other doors, were there not?

1042
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:40,800
No.

1043
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,380
Only has three doors.

1044
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,580
Oh, and we went in this one.

1045
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,400
So, back to the elevator.

1046
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,320
The big energy source.

1047
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,080
Oh no!

1048
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:07,240
Where is my son?

1049
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,820
Welcome to bamboo ship.

1050
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,460
I hope you find him.

1051
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:15,180
Hold on.

1052
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:22,420
Oh, here we go.

1053
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,340
To the lying room.

1054
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,700
The not pitch black void.

1055
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,280
Oh shoot, they are back.

1056
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,250
Oh, things look like I could...

1057
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:52,690
Sorry, my Castlevania brain turned on for a second there.

1058
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:57,430
My Castlebrania brain was just like...

1059
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,990
My Castlebrania, if you will.

1060
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,910
Was definitely like, yeah, you got this.

1061
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:07,750
You can just destroy those.

1062
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:09,570
Castlebrania.

1063
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:15,990
We use the fragment.

1064
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:19,470
And now the elevator works.

1065
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,250
And it said it goes down?

1066
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:31,070
We went all the way up just to go back down?

1067
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:44,880
I remember, this leads to the entrance.

1068
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,860
I thought, or rather, I remember...

1069
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:52,780
Are we at the entrance?

1070
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,220
Yeah.

1071
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:02,340
I also have 13,000.

1072
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:05,280
We could get stinger level 2.

1073
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:14,410
You can enter the fire door.

1074
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:16,050
I forgot about that, thank you guys.

1075
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,220
Stinger level 2 increases the range.

1076
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:28,160
I'm like, do we get that or do we get air hike?

1077
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:31,940
I don't think, I feel like I'm not going to use Agni and Rudra very much.

1078
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:43,330
TMC 3 was originally supposed to be Silent Hill 64.

1079
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:46,430
But then Nintendo sent them TMCA.

1080
01:19:57,310 --> 01:19:58,130
This guy?

1081
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:08,810
Oh, there we go.

1082
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:14,730
Crimson flames twist and dance around the door, keeping all would-be trespassers at bay.

1083
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:16,690
Oh, I have the...

1084
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:20,090
Guys, I'm...OK.

1085
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,210
I knew that would happen.

1086
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:29,410
Oh my god, the light.

1087
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:29,790
Wait, wait, wait.

1088
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:38,990
Oh gosh, I keep...

1089
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:04,480
Everything's fine.

1090
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,580
I got a gorb!

1091
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,100
Yippee!

1092
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:14,520
OK.

1093
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:22,650
Back in TMC 1 I would have been thanking the heavens.

1094
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:25,290
I don't know what's wrong with you either.

1095
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:26,810
I don't know.

1096
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:30,870
Cursed Skull Chamber.

1097
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:34,430
Who's naming these places?

1098
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:40,330
And over here we have the bathroom on your right.

1099
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:43,290
And to your left we have the cursed skull chamber.

1100
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,830
I broke them though.

1101
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,160
Probably the bald dude.

1102
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,200
Dad?

1103
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:03,640
Yeah, probably he was just like...

1104
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,640
This is the cursed...

1105
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,300
He would say it in a weird way, you know.

1106
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:10,540
This is the cursed skull room.

1107
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:12,120
What is this?

1108
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,200
What am I trying to bash in?

1109
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:19,660
Hold on.

1110
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,460
I can't see with this camera.

1111
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:25,540
Uh...

1112
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,140
Am I...

1113
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:37,850
Do I hit it to swing it to break something?

1114
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:40,590
Oh, I just break it?

1115
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:42,570
Yeah,

1116
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,040
is the room cursed or the skulls cursed?

1117
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,400
That's such a great question.

1118
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,880
That is a great question.

1119
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:57,860
Oh...

1120
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:58,320
What?

1121
01:22:58,540 --> 01:22:59,020
No, nothing.

1122
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,100
Where did it go?

1123
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,720
Oh, I have to do it again.

1124
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,040
Is it a cursed chamber for skulls or a chamber for cursed skulls?

1125
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:22,300
Oh wait, this is...

1126
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:23,300
Did it fix itself?

1127
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:24,080
Oh my god.

1128
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:30,280
I don't like the camera angle in this.

1129
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:32,620
The camera angle makes it so tricky!

1130
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,840
Dante, move please!

1131
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:41,480
Oh my god.

1132
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:44,080
Oh my god, lock on does nothing either.

1133
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,500
What if I did this instead?

1134
01:24:01,610 --> 01:24:02,210
OK.

1135
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:04,170
Nope, it's not doing anything.

1136
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:05,090
No damage!

1137
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:05,810
No damage!

1138
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,210
No damage!

1139
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:13,170
Oh my god, where did it go?

1140
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:20,050
Jump on it, Mint.

1141
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,610
Yeah, I learned that.

1142
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:24,750
You can't jump on it.

1143
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:25,870
I'm trying.

1144
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:28,830
I'm trying, God.

1145
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:36,430
Oh my god.

1146
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:40,630
Stop!

1147
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:41,630
Dante!

1148
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:51,110
Get up on the Hydra's back!

1149
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:54,210
Get up on the Hydra's back!

1150
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:56,030
Get up on the Wrecking Ball's back!

1151
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:58,770
Oh my god, Buster, you and I have the same brain.

1152
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:04,030
Might be a good job for...yeah, you know what?

1153
01:25:04,050 --> 01:25:04,510
Let's try that.

1154
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:11,940
It just runs away so fast!

1155
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,060
I got a crystal!

1156
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:23,800
Indiana Jones.

1157
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,180
An eerie sculpture made of magic crystal.

1158
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,660
It seems to be a piece of a larger creation.

1159
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:30,440
I think I know.

1160
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,100
I knew this was going to happen.

1161
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:33,820
No!

1162
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,420
You bastard!

1163
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:38,780
You!

1164
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:39,280
You!

1165
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:39,980
You!

1166
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:40,780
You!

1167
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:41,900
You!

1168
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:43,180
Die!

1169
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,020
Die!

1170
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:44,780
You!

1171
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:46,000
You die!

1172
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,960
You die right now!

1173
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,260
I don't want to deal with your shit!

1174
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:51,580
You stinking man!

1175
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,500
Ouch!

1176
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:54,700
Die!

1177
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:55,340
Yeah!

1178
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:56,260
Yeah!

1179
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:57,560
Yeah!

1180
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:58,580
Yeah!

1181
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,360
OK, now we can deal with everything else.

1182
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:15,580
Oh my god, I'm gonna die!

1183
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:24,650
I do have a Grorb.

1184
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:28,770
Or the Vitality Star.

1185
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:52,150
I'm

1186
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:12,550
gonna die!

1187
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:28,170
I mean, I guess?

1188
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:31,230
I mean, I guess.

1189
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:39,190
Oh, they hit hard!

1190
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:39,270
Die!

1191
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:48,910
Oh, ouchie ouchie.

1192
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,960
I'm trying to stinger spam for real.

1193
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,360
But they're all... I can't see.

1194
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:03,220
I can't see.

1195
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:05,940
I can't see!

1196
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:06,480
Oh, please!

1197
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:07,900
Go away!

1198
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:08,540
I can't see!

1199
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:10,940
Oh my god, stop, please.

1200
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:01,690
I think Cerberus is good for groups.

1201
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:06,110
I'll remember that next time.

1202
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:14,750
Oh, there's...

1203
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:34,360
Editor, no, she will not remember that.

1204
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:35,140
That's not true!

1205
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:38,380
I live...well, I don't live, but I do learn!

1206
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:40,740
I do learn!

1207
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:43,740
It's not true, I remember things.

1208
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:47,160
Sometimes I don't remember them immediately, but I remember.

1209
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,820
And now I'm getting Grorbs.

1210
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:00,960
Now will I remember it next time I play?

1211
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,260
That's debatable.

1212
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,220
I want that one.

1213
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:06,760
Oh, there's more right there.

1214
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:08,420
How do I go downstairs?

1215
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:09,120
Let's see.

1216
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:12,360
Over here.

1217
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,700
You stinking guy!

1218
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:22,660
Elevator at the bottom.

1219
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:25,760
Yeah, I'm getting the Grorbs first, you guys.

1220
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:26,540
I just said that.

1221
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:31,260
Oh, there it is.

1222
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:33,640
I'm getting the Grorbs first.

1223
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,330
That's probably enough.

1224
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:59,100
My bad, get that bag, G.

1225
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,380
I got it.

1226
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,540
Alrighty, now let's go take our crystal skull.

1227
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:11,160
No!

1228
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,260
No, I'm not feeling very tranquil!

1229
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,440
I'm not feeling very tranquil!

1230
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:30,410
Alright, let's try it then.

1231
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:44,730
Oh my god, I don't have the double...I don't have air height.

1232
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:48,090
Sorry, I'm turning it down.

1233
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:48,810
It's so loud.

1234
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:52,810
Wait, where do I...

1235
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:06,060
Do I have the crystal skull still?

1236
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,240
How do I see if I have it?

1237
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,020
Oh, ok.

1238
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:18,840
Easy peasy.

1239
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:19,980
Good, good, good.

1240
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:21,620
Let's see.

1241
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,680
Ok, no worries.

1242
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:28,860
My Grorbs!

1243
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:28,940
Grorbs!

1244
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:34,030
Grorbs!

1245
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:39,650
We are all good to go.

1246
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:44,290
You know what?

1247
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:46,210
I'll try using Cerberus from the start though.

1248
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:58,100
He's like, get the hell away from me, you stupid ass!

1249
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,220
I wish you'd just die already!

1250
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,620
Jump and grab my riches.

1251
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:27,150
I like Cerberus a lot actually.

1252
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,360
Ok, more!

1253
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:33,800
More!

1254
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:34,740
No!

1255
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:36,800
This guy!

1256
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:38,160
God!

1257
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:40,300
Parry!

1258
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:42,900
Parry the platypus!

1259
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:46,340
Ok,

1260
01:33:55,570 --> 01:33:56,250
I'm switching back.

1261
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:07,770
Ok.

1262
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:08,190
Oh shit.

1263
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,350
I was so close to timing it.

1264
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:16,930
Get

1265
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:21,200
him!

1266
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:22,580
Oh, he just disappeared!

1267
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,600
Oh, that's what I meant to do.

1268
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,800
God, you bastard!

1269
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:51,370
It's like we are back at chapter 1.

1270
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:10,280
No, I don't want to use Royal Guard.

1271
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:11,620
I'm not good at it.

1272
01:35:18,990 --> 01:35:22,970
We were able to take care of these guys pretty quickly with this, so...

1273
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:43,930
Stop it!

1274
01:35:50,310 --> 01:35:51,210
Where's the others?

1275
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:53,470
Already.

1276
01:36:11,910 --> 01:36:13,450
Why can't I see his health?

1277
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,270
It's so annoying.

1278
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:22,950
Oh my god.

1279
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,460
That was so good!

1280
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,420
Oh no, that was not good though.

1281
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:59,010
You bastard!

1282
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:09,050
Jump!

1283
01:37:12,190 --> 01:37:12,190
Jump!

1284
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:12,350
Jump!

1285
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:14,570
Oh shit.

1286
01:37:14,570 --> 01:37:15,410
What?

1287
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:47,400
The health for the enemy is the green part of the lock on circle.

1288
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:53,500
I see, I see, I see.

1289
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:05,220
We got some decent...well, I got some dodges in there.

1290
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,340
Use the crystal skull!

1291
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:23,240
Hello, R.O.R.B.

1292
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:25,600
R.O.R.B.

1293
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:26,660
Machine And...

1294
01:38:32,810 --> 01:38:36,150
This thing doesn't give you better stuff for...

1295
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:38,350
For combos or anything, right?

1296
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:39,270
He's just a...

1297
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,510
He just gives you stuff.

1298
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:51,840
Time to get motivated.

1299
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:54,600
You guys are scaring me.

1300
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,540
Actually this whole scene is scary.

1301
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,580
You guys are scaring me.

1302
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,880
You guys are scaring me!

1303
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:00,300
OK.

1304
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:03,280
No spoilers, no spoilers.

1305
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,240
I won't look in chat anymore.

1306
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:04,880
I won't look in chat.

1307
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:10,570
I don't think I have enough money for anything.

1308
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:15,010
When will my sword master level up?

1309
01:39:16,130 --> 01:39:16,430
Truly.

1310
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:36,280
Should I buy items?

1311
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:37,300
I don't know.

1312
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:45,860
You'll either be scared or hot and bothered.

1313
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:49,640
What about...what about all three?

1314
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:55,400
Hold on, I'm going to put some eye drops in.

1315
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,460
My ectoplasm is starting to dry out.

1316
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:06,340
This weather...

1317
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,640
Makes my ectoplasm all dried up.

1318
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:12,820
Stay hydrated everybody.

1319
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:14,660
Stay hydrated.

1320
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:20,220
15k for a blorb.

1321
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:21,640
I know it's a scam, isn't it?

1322
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:23,160
So rude.

1323
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:30,650
OK.

1324
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:31,750
Eye hydration.

1325
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:36,170
Hydration.

1326
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:40,610
Hold on, my eyes are all blurry now.

1327
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:48,210
I guess I...I mean, I'll see what I get into and then see if I want to buy anything.

1328
01:40:48,650 --> 01:40:49,390
I'm scared.

1329
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:50,650
You guys are scaring me.

1330
01:40:50,830 --> 01:40:52,110
I want to see what happens first.

1331
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:57,210
And then I'll see if I want to buy any vital stars.

1332
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:06,870
Don't attack me door.

1333
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:07,870
Oh my god, it's raining.

1334
01:41:09,330 --> 01:41:10,570
How is it raining right here?

1335
01:41:10,650 --> 01:41:11,510
Are we not under...

1336
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:14,410
Oh, is that just a light?

1337
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:15,810
Oh, it's just a light.

1338
01:41:15,930 --> 01:41:16,050
OK.

1339
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:18,630
I'm coming for you, brother.

1340
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:21,450
I always wanted a brother.

1341
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:25,090
I always wanted a brother.

1342
01:41:30,630 --> 01:41:32,250
I always wanted a brother.

1343
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:39,070
Why does this feel like a final boss?

1344
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:45,750
Are we going to have the scene from the opening?

1345
01:42:02,210 --> 01:42:02,970
No food.

1346
01:42:03,570 --> 01:42:04,230
No drinks.

1347
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:07,690
And the only babe just left.

1348
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:09,190
I can't hear you.

1349
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:11,770
Over the music.

1350
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:17,430
I was so eager to see you, I couldn't concentrate on preparations for the bash.

1351
01:42:18,270 --> 01:42:18,750
What?

1352
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:22,370
At any rate, it's been a whole year since we last met.

1353
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:24,710
How about a kiss from your little brother?

1354
01:42:26,570 --> 01:42:29,190
Or better yet, how about a kiss from this?

1355
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:31,070
Did he just wink?

1356
01:42:33,550 --> 01:42:37,730
It's like that coffee commercial.

1357
01:42:47,110 --> 01:42:48,250
Peak of darkness.

1358
01:42:48,990 --> 01:42:50,130
OK, I can do that too.

1359
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:52,510
Oh, my health is not the same as yours.

1360
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:12,610
Uh...

1361
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:14,490
Got it.

1362
01:43:17,450 --> 01:43:20,250
I don't think I was motivated enough.

1363
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:21,710
Hello?

1364
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:24,330
Hello?

1365
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:28,810
Where is your motivation?

1366
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:31,150
Oh, gosh, you guys.

1367
01:43:31,290 --> 01:43:31,510
OK.

1368
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:38,390
I almost want to watch a tutorial on this video.

1369
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:40,770
Or like a how-to.

1370
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:46,690
You know, sometimes before I fight bosses, I like to watch people fight them.

1371
01:43:47,070 --> 01:43:49,650
I had it last night after...

1372
01:43:50,630 --> 01:43:51,830
After Astro Bot.

1373
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:54,090
I played Astro Bot yesterday.

1374
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:57,730
And I unlocked the secret last level.

1375
01:43:58,070 --> 01:44:00,110
And I watched someone how to do it.

1376
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:05,230
And then I saw one of the comments and they were just like, after I watched this, I did it in one try.

1377
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:05,790
It was so good.

1378
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:08,070
How to get motivated.

1379
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:09,070
Oh, my god.

1380
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:11,070
Trickster could be good here.

1381
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,080
I'm scared of him.

1382
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:30,080
Basic strategy is to dodge and then counterattack.

1383
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:34,140
Watching how other players helps with learning and getting good.

1384
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:37,880
Skip your cutscene, sorry.

1385
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,480
He's gonna say, where is your motivation?

1386
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:41,700
And then he's gonna attack me.

1387
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:42,920
I'm gonna be scared.

1388
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:46,460
Where is your motivation?

1389
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:51,420
I tried to leave.

1390
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:54,480
Oh, my god.

1391
01:45:08,650 --> 01:45:10,790
Where is your motivation?

1392
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:15,370
Where is your motivation?

1393
01:45:16,450 --> 01:45:17,130
Motivation...

1394
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:22,830
Where is your motivation?

1395
01:45:23,690 --> 01:45:25,230
Maybe if I can slowly...

1396
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:25,910
Oh, my god.

1397
01:45:25,930 --> 01:45:26,810
He still got me.

1398
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:28,390
Maybe I can...

1399
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:37,110
Maybe I can slowly but surely chip him down.

1400
01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:41,330
Where is your motivation?

1401
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,390
Where is your motivation?

1402
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:53,850
Where is your motivation?

1403
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:04,880
Where is your motivation?

1404
01:46:17,390 --> 01:46:18,510
That's not good.

1405
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:19,110
Oh, my god.

1406
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,920
Now I'm motivated.

1407
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:29,740
Me too.

1408
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:32,120
Where is your motivation?

1409
01:46:38,410 --> 01:46:39,390
Oh, shit.

1410
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,080
Ah,

1411
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:53,060
no!

1412
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,220
That was too slow.

1413
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:58,080
Where is your motivation?

1414
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:04,050
Where is your motivation?

1415
01:47:04,770 --> 01:47:05,270
Come here.

1416
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:13,180
This may be fun.

1417
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:20,700
This may be fun.

1418
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:21,960
Oh, shit.

1419
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:23,240
I meant to dodge.

1420
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,500
I'm so stupid.

1421
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:27,820
Oh, gosh.

1422
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:28,860
I got greedy.

1423
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,200
Did you just call me scum?

1424
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:36,220
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1425
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:40,100
Where is your motivation?

1426
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:43,680
I'm gonna... Oh, 1 HP and a dream.

1427
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,000
Scum.

1428
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:02,180
Oh, I don't know why I did that.

1429
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:04,080
I don't know why I did that.

1430
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:09,000
I don't know why I went back in.

1431
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,020
It's okay though.

1432
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,260
I don't think I would have made it.

1433
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:15,020
Good second try.

1434
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:15,820
Thank you.

1435
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:17,540
Yeah.

1436
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:19,540
Oh, wait.

1437
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,180
I think I might buy...

1438
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:27,060
I might buy a small, small vital store.

1439
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:29,620
Where is your motivation?

1440
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:31,180
You got plenty of stuff to use, Mito.

1441
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:32,600
Mate is always flexible.

1442
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:33,160
You got this.

1443
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:33,860
Thank you!

1444
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:35,480
I don't know.

1445
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:37,240
I think I'm...

1446
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:40,380
I'm like an old dog when it comes to...

1447
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:43,520
I just like to have one thing that I like to use.

1448
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:45,920
And I don't want to switch it up.

1449
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:49,360
I know that's probably like... I mean, that's so rigid.

1450
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:51,940
And it makes me not as good of a gamer.

1451
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:55,500
But I just... That's just... That's how I like to do it.

1452
01:48:55,580 --> 01:48:56,040
I don't know.

1453
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:01,320
I think it's great when a game gives you lots of options.

1454
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,060
So it's just like, oh, if you don't like playing with this...

1455
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:05,960
You can play with this instead.

1456
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:11,880
And if you're able to be a type of person that's just like...

1457
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:14,660
Okay, now I hit and then I switch to this weapon...

1458
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:16,840
And I hit and then I switch to this weapon and I hit...

1459
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:17,840
Like, good for you.

1460
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:21,280
But I just... I don't have the...

1461
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:22,420
Dexterity.

1462
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:25,580
I don't have the dexterity to do it.

1463
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:29,120
Happy Christmas week!

1464
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:30,060
Happy Christmas week!

1465
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:30,700
Thanks, Jacob!

1466
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:35,840
Fun fact, Dan Southworth, Virgil's VA, had a cold during recording of this game.

1467
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,520
That's why he sounds so nasally and nerdy.

1468
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:40,400
Really?

1469
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,640
Oh, he didn't?

1470
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:46,000
Wait.

1471
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:48,160
It's a lie?

1472
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,140
Oh, it's a myth.

1473
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:51,640
Oh, he debunked this.

1474
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:52,900
Aww.

1475
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:54,820
You were trying.

1476
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:59,360
Reach, you thought you had a fun fact, but instead it was a lie.

1477
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,760
It was not a fact at all.

1478
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:03,240
It was a lie fact.

1479
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:05,660
Maybe.

1480
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:07,360
Sorry, I heard about it.

1481
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:08,760
No, don't apologize.

1482
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:12,760
See, you guys made him feel bad.

1483
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,060
You guys made him feel bad.

1484
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:19,540
I'm confused though.

1485
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:20,580
I was on Trickster.

1486
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:22,680
How do I have double jump?

1487
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,220
I thought only Sword Master had that.

1488
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:28,920
How do I have air hike?

1489
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:35,420
Oh, it's the weapon.

1490
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:36,560
That's right.

1491
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:37,880
It's not the style, it's the weapon.

1492
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:38,580
Thank you.

1493
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:39,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1494
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:43,400
That's right.

1495
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:49,700
Don't worry, with this one I died like a hundred times to this guy and he was doing really well.

1496
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,980
I do hope he finds that motivation though.

1497
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:57,000
Yeah, the weapon has the double jump.

1498
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:05,660
You were doing great on that second attempt.

1499
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:08,120
I'm just afraid for phase two.

1500
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:12,320
I'm afraid for phase two.

1501
01:51:16,570 --> 01:51:17,330
Oh.

1502
01:51:17,930 --> 01:51:18,590
Are you gonna move?

1503
01:51:19,770 --> 01:51:21,370
Where's your motivation?

1504
01:51:28,670 --> 01:51:29,970
Oh, why did I do that?

1505
01:51:45,860 --> 01:51:47,860
Okay, I need to be able to see there.

1506
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:49,940
I can't see anything with the camera.

1507
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:54,120
The camera does not let you... The camera is automatically changing, by the way, in case you're wondering.

1508
01:51:59,890 --> 01:52:01,310
Why do you put your sword away?

1509
01:52:01,310 --> 01:52:01,830
Oh.

1510
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:18,700
Now I'm motivated.

1511
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:19,840
Why are you standing there then?

1512
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:22,000
You're scaring me, Virgil.

1513
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:23,780
Virgil, you're scaring me!

1514
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:27,120
Oh shit.

1515
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:31,320
Counter, counter.

1516
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:49,700
I'm concentrated.

1517
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:51,540
I'm concentrating.

1518
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:52,900
Sorry if I don't talk much.

1519
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,400
Where's your motivation?

1520
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:56,940
Where's your motivation?

1521
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,240
Skum.

1522
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:02,680
Skum.

1523
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:06,600
Skum.

1524
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:17,880
Now I'm motivated.

1525
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:18,900
Yeah.

1526
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:20,760
Why are you just standing there then?

1527
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:22,920
Where's your motivation?

1528
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:27,820
I love the way he says this.

1529
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:28,500
It's so funny.

1530
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:33,640
I'm glad I got stinger too.

1531
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:43,730
Oh shit.

1532
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:45,190
Skum.

1533
01:53:46,330 --> 01:53:47,030
Oh shit.

1534
01:53:47,290 --> 01:53:48,390
Oh shit, shit, shit, shit.

1535
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:49,390
Leave.

1536
01:53:51,310 --> 01:53:52,370
Oh, his hair!

1537
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:11,330
His hair fell down.

1538
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:15,230
Oh shit.

1539
01:54:15,950 --> 01:54:17,190
Oh my god, he's everywhere.

1540
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:18,550
What is that?

1541
01:54:18,730 --> 01:54:19,510
Oh no, round two.

1542
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:20,630
Haha, phase two.

1543
01:54:22,930 --> 01:54:24,590
Your hair, Virgil.

1544
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:37,670
Now I'm motivated.

1545
01:54:38,290 --> 01:54:38,710
Die.

1546
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:42,650
Where did he go?

1547
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:42,970
Ok.

1548
01:54:53,140 --> 01:54:54,520
Learned, learned, learned.

1549
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:56,480
Learned, learned, learned.

1550
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,020
Ok, come here.

1551
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:01,740
Skum, skum here.

1552
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:12,200
That one's spooky.

1553
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:15,240
Skum here, baby.

1554
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:15,400
Sorry.

1555
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:19,760
You're scaring me, Virgil.

1556
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:22,760
Virgil, you're scaring me when you stand over there.

1557
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:24,000
In the dark.

1558
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:28,400
Did you name the void of pitch black darkness?

1559
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:30,140
Because we need to talk about that, buddy.

1560
01:55:34,770 --> 01:55:36,170
We need to talk about that.

1561
01:55:37,190 --> 01:55:38,730
Can you come out here?

1562
01:55:39,530 --> 01:55:40,170
Taunt back.

1563
01:55:40,430 --> 01:55:40,830
Can I?

1564
01:55:41,570 --> 01:55:42,990
I don't remember how to taunt.

1565
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:50,920
Oops.

1566
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,680
That was close.

1567
01:55:56,660 --> 01:55:57,280
Select.

1568
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:59,360
Oh god, my finger can't reach over there.

1569
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:08,000
I did it.

1570
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:10,180
We're circling.

1571
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:11,400
This is like a real battle.

1572
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:14,200
No!

1573
01:56:16,690 --> 01:56:17,650
Nice, nice, nice.

1574
01:56:23,390 --> 01:56:25,250
Where's your motivation?

1575
01:56:26,590 --> 01:56:27,950
Come on, man.

1576
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:29,130
Come on.

1577
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:37,090
It's the way he just stands there.

1578
01:56:41,050 --> 01:56:41,930
Now

1579
01:56:45,210 --> 01:56:46,210
I'm motivated.

1580
01:56:59,650 --> 01:57:01,410
Ok, no...

1581
01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:02,510
No...

1582
01:57:03,610 --> 01:57:04,990
I'm getting sweaty hands.

1583
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:13,190
Where's your motivation?

1584
01:57:27,310 --> 01:57:28,090
Come on, wimp.

1585
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:29,050
Oh, that's what he's saying.

1586
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:29,390
Wimp.

1587
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:30,470
Come on, wimp.

1588
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:36,040
Oh, shoot.

1589
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:36,760
Why did I do that?

1590
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:41,800
This may be fun.

1591
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:43,080
Oh, sh... damn.

1592
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:48,520
Just a little bit.

1593
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:51,480
No!

1594
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:05,510
Scum.

1595
01:58:10,050 --> 01:58:11,410
Sibling rivalry.

1596
01:58:11,410 --> 01:58:11,730
Do it.

1597
01:58:16,150 --> 01:58:17,070
Yippee!

1598
01:58:21,610 --> 01:58:22,530
What?

1599
01:58:31,290 --> 01:58:33,110
Oh my god, that's insane.

1600
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:48,820
I think I've seen someone beating him so cleanly with no experience and on first playthrough you game.

1601
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:49,560
Thank you, Gaito!

1602
01:58:54,380 --> 01:58:56,280
And it was second try too.

1603
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:57,760
That was second try, right?

1604
01:58:58,140 --> 01:58:59,200
Or did I die one more time?

1605
01:58:59,300 --> 01:58:59,680
I don't remember.

1606
01:59:04,190 --> 01:59:06,090
He asked where my motivation was.

1607
01:59:06,630 --> 01:59:07,210
Third try.

1608
01:59:08,510 --> 01:59:10,650
Still, third time's the charm, right?

1609
01:59:10,650 --> 01:59:10,810
Damn it.

1610
01:59:14,630 --> 01:59:16,770
This is... this is the opening.

1611
01:59:26,930 --> 01:59:29,630
What about motivation?

1612
01:59:43,390 --> 01:59:44,850
Thank you for the Hakushupla.

1613
01:59:46,490 --> 01:59:49,050
He got our necklace.

1614
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:54,890
No,

1615
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:05,120
our necklace!

1616
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:06,660
Mommy's necklace!

1617
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,200
Oh my god, so brutal.

1618
02:00:28,230 --> 02:00:29,590
Dante, get up!

1619
02:00:29,910 --> 02:00:31,150
You got shot in the head earlier.

1620
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:31,590
Are you ok?

1621
02:00:32,430 --> 02:00:33,010
Dante!

1622
02:00:40,730 --> 02:00:45,110
I can't do it.

1623
02:01:01,570 --> 02:01:03,350
Jack is back, baby.

1624
02:01:17,510 --> 02:01:18,930
Thank you for the raid.

1625
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:19,750
Hi, Julius.

1626
02:01:20,230 --> 02:01:21,070
Thank you for the raid.

1627
02:01:30,210 --> 02:01:30,910
Dante!

1628
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:42,530
Was that my devil trigger?

1629
02:01:51,450 --> 02:01:52,850
It was?

1630
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:53,490
No way.

1631
02:01:54,930 --> 02:01:55,630
Yippee!

1632
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:03,270
Boi.

1633
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:04,930
Doi.

1634
02:02:06,250 --> 02:02:06,810
Boi.

1635
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:10,270
Boi!

1636
02:02:11,490 --> 02:02:12,490
Let's go!

1637
02:02:14,430 --> 02:02:15,690
Oh, jeez.

1638
02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:20,670
Minky Gaming!

1639
02:02:21,190 --> 02:02:22,490
Great job, you were really motivated.

1640
02:02:22,650 --> 02:02:23,450
Thank you!

1641
02:02:25,090 --> 02:02:27,030
Grimble Grumble.

1642
02:02:27,030 --> 02:02:29,810
Oh, your profile picture scares me.

1643
02:02:30,130 --> 02:02:31,190
Thank you for the...

1644
02:02:31,190 --> 02:02:35,770
Thank you for the 6th one.

1645
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:41,170
Fun fact, the devil trigger forms in this game were designed by Kaneko of FSMT fame.

1646
02:02:41,310 --> 02:02:42,250
Oh, cool!

1647
02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:44,250
Did I save?

1648
02:02:44,730 --> 02:02:45,210
Yes.

1649
02:02:45,390 --> 02:02:45,530
Ok.

1650
02:02:47,110 --> 02:02:49,570
Are you ready for peak style, Minto?

1651
02:02:50,690 --> 02:02:51,710
I don't know.

1652
02:02:54,930 --> 02:02:56,270
What was that?

1653
02:02:56,430 --> 02:02:57,990
Two missions in two hours?

1654
02:03:07,570 --> 02:03:08,530
Let

1655
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:17,660
me turn it up.

1656
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:43,520
Dante!

1657
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:45,300
Dante!

1658
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:51,560
What is this?

1659
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:55,680
Take him down Dante!

1660
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:56,340
Take him down!

1661
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:09,920
The eagles!

1662
02:04:20,860 --> 02:04:21,580
Woohoo!

1663
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:27,740
Oh my god!

1664
02:04:33,410 --> 02:04:33,790
Do

1665
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:38,440
that Dante, they'll spawn more!

1666
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:40,260
Maybe he wants that though.

1667
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:43,180
Oh my god!

1668
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:03,720
Holy shit.

1669
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:07,480
What the hell is... A whale?

1670
02:05:13,420 --> 02:05:13,900
Huh?

1671
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,680
Burst forth from the great demon's womb.

1672
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:19,800
No way!

1673
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:22,880
We went through all of that just to get bored?

1674
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:28,420
I don't think I got any robes, did I?

1675
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:31,920
Oh, I have 15,000.

1676
02:05:46,730 --> 02:05:48,890
I really do like servers.

1677
02:05:50,190 --> 02:05:50,930
I do a lot.

1678
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:56,240
Help pack.

1679
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:59,320
Spin the nunchucks around in a propeller-like motion.

1680
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:04,920
You can buy porbs.

1681
02:06:05,420 --> 02:06:05,880
I can.

1682
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:09,320
Oh, you're right!

1683
02:06:09,580 --> 02:06:11,620
I can buy the plorbs.

1684
02:06:12,740 --> 02:06:13,260
Porbs.

1685
02:06:16,780 --> 02:06:17,300
Tinyzoo!

1686
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:18,500
Thanks for the time gift!

1687
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:20,360
Thank you, thank you.

1688
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:22,920
That is the best DMC cutscene IMO.

1689
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:25,080
Porb time!

1690
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:29,380
First act slash third of the game done.

1691
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:30,400
Current thoughts, Minto?

1692
02:06:39,730 --> 02:06:40,910
That's my thoughts.

1693
02:06:40,910 --> 02:06:45,630
Something about this game in particular is most of the times Dante does some awesome show-offy shit...

1694
02:06:45,630 --> 02:06:48,930
...he almost immediately gets dunked on afterwards to show his inexperience.

1695
02:06:49,750 --> 02:06:51,110
You silly guy.

1696
02:06:51,930 --> 02:06:54,490
Okay, maybe I should save for the porb zone.

1697
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:55,870
Oh, I see it.

1698
02:06:57,050 --> 02:06:58,270
Well, I mean, I have money.

1699
02:06:58,450 --> 02:06:58,830
You know what?

1700
02:06:58,830 --> 02:06:59,710
I'm gonna buy a porb.

1701
02:07:00,650 --> 02:07:01,090
Porb!

1702
02:07:01,090 --> 02:07:01,830
Porb time!

1703
02:07:01,970 --> 02:07:02,450
Porb time!

1704
02:07:06,230 --> 02:07:06,670
Yeah.

1705
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:14,520
Oh, is this a swimming level?

1706
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:17,540
Please say no.

1707
02:07:18,660 --> 02:07:20,340
Oh, oh

1708
02:07:24,490 --> 02:07:27,370
gosh.

1709
02:07:27,710 --> 02:07:28,450
Devil trigger!

1710
02:07:29,710 --> 02:07:29,990
Yeah!

1711
02:07:32,150 --> 02:07:33,070
Oh no.

1712
02:07:33,650 --> 02:07:34,970
It's like this effect.

1713
02:07:39,030 --> 02:07:42,230
The seal has been dispelled, opening up a single stone tusk.

1714
02:07:42,610 --> 02:07:44,030
Four more tusks remain.

1715
02:07:44,870 --> 02:07:45,190
Okay.

1716
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:47,390
Any up here?

1717
02:07:47,490 --> 02:07:47,670
No.

1718
02:07:48,370 --> 02:07:49,750
Oh, I hate this effect.

1719
02:07:50,410 --> 02:07:51,310
Does this hurt me?

1720
02:07:51,490 --> 02:07:52,050
Yes, it does.

1721
02:07:55,610 --> 02:07:57,490
Oh, I hate this effect so much.

1722
02:07:57,530 --> 02:07:58,790
Why do they always do this?

1723
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:04,280
Oh, this is... okay.

1724
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:06,040
Is this a school, guys?

1725
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:08,160
No, the children!

1726
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:12,340
What is this over here?

1727
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:22,520
Devil's teeter-totter.

1728
02:08:22,580 --> 02:08:23,880
Ride the elevator to the top?

1729
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:28,580
Oh no, not this stuff again.

1730
02:08:35,190 --> 02:08:36,630
It's this one!

1731
02:08:37,190 --> 02:08:38,390
I hate this.

1732
02:08:38,450 --> 02:08:40,570
I think we did this one before and I gave up.

1733
02:08:41,150 --> 02:08:41,930
I'm pretty sure.

1734
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:50,960
Because you fall off so easily.

1735
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:53,740
What's the cheese for it?

1736
02:08:56,980 --> 02:08:58,040
What's the cheese?

1737
02:08:59,180 --> 02:08:59,620
Gouda?

1738
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:13,100
Oh, don't do that.

1739
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:15,300
Wait, why is it going down?

1740
02:09:17,420 --> 02:09:18,800
Wait, why did it go down?

1741
02:09:28,030 --> 02:09:29,170
Why did it go down?

1742
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:30,070
Too much weight?

1743
02:09:30,450 --> 02:09:31,670
Are you kidding me right now?

1744
02:09:33,650 --> 02:09:35,870
Oh, I didn't mean to style on the wall.

1745
02:09:35,950 --> 02:09:36,630
I meant to leave.

1746
02:10:01,470 --> 02:10:02,450
You're still alive?

1747
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:11,280
Is it because he's blocking?

1748
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:16,620
Oh my god, there we go.

1749
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:18,320
Hairy god.

1750
02:10:18,440 --> 02:10:19,660
For real though.

1751
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:21,460
Holy hell.

1752
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:22,760
Get me out of here please.

1753
02:10:24,580 --> 02:10:27,240
Isn't this the skull that releases you from the torture?

1754
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:29,360
Please let me leave.

1755
02:10:30,180 --> 02:10:30,720
Please.

1756
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:32,460
I don't want to be here anymore.

1757
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,760
I don't want to style on the wall.

1758
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:39,020
Try to walk out the door.

1759
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:40,120
What door?

1760
02:10:40,620 --> 02:10:41,120
There's a door?

1761
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:54,960
Anyway, nobody cared.

1762
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:57,560
Ouch.

1763
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:07,240
A seal has been released opening up a single stone tusk.

1764
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:09,720
Three more tusks remain.

1765
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,580
Okay, I found one.

1766
02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:16,460
By the pirate ship.

1767
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:18,520
Awesome.

1768
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:22,720
Two more tusks remain.

1769
02:11:23,220 --> 02:11:24,460
Is there any on the pirate ship?

1770
02:11:28,180 --> 02:11:31,100
There's a lore fragment on it.

1771
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:34,820
Remember hell from DMC1?

1772
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,440
Yes, I do very...

1773
02:11:37,180 --> 02:11:40,760
I think though, it's not really bothering me so much today.

1774
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:41,760
The effect.

1775
02:11:42,220 --> 02:11:44,220
I think maybe I was just not feeling well that day.

1776
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:51,340
Because right now, like it's annoying, but I'm not feeling like I'm going to throw up or anything.

1777
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:55,120
So, that's a win I suppose.

1778
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:59,120
I was trying to get up to the...

1779
02:12:02,140 --> 02:12:03,900
Does it still suck?

1780
02:12:04,620 --> 02:12:05,180
Yeah.

1781
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:11,520
I think maybe also it could have been the graphics from the other game.

1782
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:13,920
Potentially.

1783
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:20,360
Because I don't get motion sick in games very much.

1784
02:12:20,820 --> 02:12:22,220
So I feel like it was a me issue.

1785
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:28,860
What was the other thing that I was trying to get to?

1786
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:32,140
Come

1787
02:12:36,490 --> 02:12:36,750
on.

1788
02:12:37,150 --> 02:12:37,850
Wait, what's this?

1789
02:12:41,450 --> 02:12:43,610
Oh, I didn't even notice this.

1790
02:12:45,950 --> 02:12:46,370
Ouch!

1791
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:52,850
Guys, this is looking pretty sussy.

1792
02:12:54,290 --> 02:12:56,070
One more tusk remains.

1793
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:08,820
Nice.

1794
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:10,900
This is where I was trying to get up to.

1795
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:14,440
There's so much up here.

1796
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:20,780
I guess we are technically going into the womb, huh?

1797
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:27,160
Get me!

1798
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:27,600
Get me!

1799
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:28,020
Get me!

1800
02:13:36,690 --> 02:13:37,930
Yeah!

1801
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:44,530
I don't know if I want to go in there.

1802
02:13:45,290 --> 02:13:46,410
I want this though.

1803
02:13:48,470 --> 02:13:49,910
Dang it!

1804
02:13:51,650 --> 02:13:53,530
I got... I missed one.

1805
02:14:00,650 --> 02:14:02,070
Leviathan's intestines.

1806
02:14:02,070 --> 02:14:02,610
Intestines.

1807
02:14:08,460 --> 02:14:09,300
This way, right?

1808
02:14:13,630 --> 02:14:14,690
Oh, I got burnt.

1809
02:14:16,450 --> 02:14:17,890
I was like, who's trying to fight me?

1810
02:14:19,210 --> 02:14:21,170
Who wants a piece of this?

1811
02:14:22,090 --> 02:14:23,510
Oh, it's so gross.

1812
02:14:23,810 --> 02:14:24,570
It's so nasty.

1813
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:36,360
Give us a break from...

1814
02:14:41,380 --> 02:14:42,820
from that...

1815
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:46,960
I'm just going to buy another... another porb.

1816
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:53,520
We are in the heart core.

1817
02:14:55,620 --> 02:15:02,000
An organ writhes ferociously on the other side of the membranous wall.

1818
02:15:02,820 --> 02:15:04,440
You can't get any closer now.

1819
02:15:06,980 --> 02:15:08,320
Alright, we go through.

1820
02:15:08,780 --> 02:15:10,840
This is so gross!

1821
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:15,220
It's just a membrane, just slice and dice it.

1822
02:15:19,210 --> 02:15:20,770
We're back in the intestines.

1823
02:15:21,550 --> 02:15:22,750
I can't see anything?

1824
02:15:23,310 --> 02:15:24,930
I don't want to fall into acid.

1825
02:15:28,350 --> 02:15:29,190
Oh my god.

1826
02:15:30,210 --> 02:15:30,770
I'm running.

1827
02:15:32,350 --> 02:15:32,870
I'm running.

1828
02:15:32,990 --> 02:15:33,190
I'm running.

1829
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:35,270
I'm dying.

1830
02:15:35,550 --> 02:15:35,750
I'm dying.

1831
02:15:35,830 --> 02:15:36,350
I'm dying.

1832
02:15:53,790 --> 02:15:56,790
I was trying to save the DT, but...

1833
02:15:58,330 --> 02:15:58,770
Understandable.

1834
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:09,700
Oh my god, he's so fast!

1835
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:11,280
He's already caught up to me!

1836
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:13,920
How

1837
02:16:17,690 --> 02:16:18,310
do I get past him?

1838
02:16:18,470 --> 02:16:19,730
Oh, I made it past.

1839
02:16:23,950 --> 02:16:24,390
Dummy.

1840
02:16:26,810 --> 02:16:27,250
Anyway...

1841
02:16:27,250 --> 02:16:27,610
Hi!

1842
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:36,160
Why are there things in here?

1843
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:39,180
He's got parasites!

1844
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:43,660
Oh my god.

1845
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,520
He's got... Oh, these are nasty!

1846
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:57,520
Oh, there's another guy over there.

1847
02:16:59,180 --> 02:16:59,400
Oh.

1848
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:03,160
Hold on, let me get my riches, please.

1849
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:03,260
Please.

1850
02:17:14,060 --> 02:17:15,440
Stinger spam!

1851
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:16,540
Stinger spam!

1852
02:17:18,660 --> 02:17:19,460
Anyway...

1853
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:20,600
Where are we?

1854
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:22,520
This is so gross.

1855
02:17:22,820 --> 02:17:24,680
Why is it so foggy in here?

1856
02:17:33,060 --> 02:17:34,400
This is just...

1857
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:37,640
I don't like body heat.

1858
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:39,680
We're in the rectum?

1859
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:41,060
Is that the...

1860
02:17:41,060 --> 02:17:42,220
Is that the...

1861
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,060
Is that the real bi-hole?

1862
02:17:45,380 --> 02:17:45,880
Oh my god.

1863
02:17:53,230 --> 02:17:54,150
Or dodge?

1864
02:17:54,330 --> 02:17:54,670
Something.

1865
02:18:01,710 --> 02:18:02,270
Nope.

1866
02:18:02,590 --> 02:18:02,970
This.

1867
02:18:03,630 --> 02:18:04,670
That's what I need you to do.

1868
02:18:13,730 --> 02:18:14,850
There's so many guys.

1869
02:18:25,350 --> 02:18:26,870
Oh, I forgot I was a trickster.

1870
02:18:44,190 --> 02:18:47,570
I've never seen a... Is this like a prolapsed anus?

1871
02:18:47,590 --> 02:18:48,230
Does that count?

1872
02:18:50,170 --> 02:18:51,270
Maybe I try this.

1873
02:18:58,240 --> 02:18:59,640
Oh my god, they don't stop coming.

1874
02:18:59,720 --> 02:19:00,620
They don't stop coming, huh?

1875
02:19:09,970 --> 02:19:11,030
Until they stop coming.

1876
02:19:12,890 --> 02:19:13,770
Where's my riches?

1877
02:19:17,350 --> 02:19:19,010
I don't think we should touch that.

1878
02:19:20,170 --> 02:19:22,150
We got the ignis fatis!

1879
02:19:26,920 --> 02:19:28,320
It's not outward, Vinto.

1880
02:19:28,780 --> 02:19:29,480
Oh, you're right.

1881
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:30,380
We're on the inside.

1882
02:19:36,130 --> 02:19:39,550
The souls of those sent to hell for the sin of jealousy.

1883
02:19:40,370 --> 02:19:42,430
They're Leviathan's energy source.

1884
02:19:47,350 --> 02:19:49,350
Why is it so dark all of a sudden?

1885
02:19:54,370 --> 02:19:56,470
He's got no energy, so... Oh god.

1886
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:09,880
Isn't this where we just got chased?

1887
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:14,340
And I thought it smelled bad on the outside.

1888
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:19,240
What are you smelling?

1889
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:22,660
This looks like a chicken.

1890
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:27,240
I wonder... I wonder...

1891
02:20:27,940 --> 02:20:32,300
What did they use to create this texture?

1892
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:33,640
You know?

1893
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:37,180
But it smells like even a wood in there.

1894
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:38,400
Yeah.

1895
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:42,180
Like McDonald's.

1896
02:20:45,420 --> 02:20:46,020
Meat?

1897
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:48,180
You think like just meat?

1898
02:20:48,580 --> 02:20:49,080
I don't know.

1899
02:20:49,180 --> 02:20:50,180
It looks...

1900
02:20:55,560 --> 02:20:56,720
Colonoscopy video.

1901
02:20:56,840 --> 02:20:57,680
That's what I'm thinking.

1902
02:21:04,950 --> 02:21:05,510
Oh god.

1903
02:21:05,730 --> 02:21:07,150
What is this?

1904
02:21:07,390 --> 02:21:08,150
Oh my god.

1905
02:21:08,330 --> 02:21:08,930
This...

1906
02:21:08,930 --> 02:21:09,790
Again?

1907
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:26,000
It's so unfair!

1908
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:26,720
Okay, I made it.

1909
02:21:37,190 --> 02:21:37,990
Oh my god.

1910
02:21:38,070 --> 02:21:40,030
Those guys are downstairs.

1911
02:21:41,390 --> 02:21:42,670
They're trying to get to me.

1912
02:21:46,410 --> 02:21:47,770
Yeah, little babies.

1913
02:21:48,410 --> 02:21:49,510
Yeah, I can't reach.

1914
02:21:56,600 --> 02:21:59,100
This is a message to you from the future.

1915
02:21:59,800 --> 02:22:01,480
Future messages to follow.

1916
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:06,480
You must remember that whatever you do in the game, don't under any circumstances...

1917
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:10,200
Don't what?

1918
02:22:10,820 --> 02:22:11,400
Oh god.

1919
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:12,620
I'm afraid to fall down.

1920
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:15,480
No,

1921
02:22:22,600 --> 02:22:24,200
that's not who I was...

1922
02:22:24,900 --> 02:22:25,300
Nevermind.

1923
02:22:25,360 --> 02:22:26,080
I didn't realize they were dead.

1924
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:27,080
Oh my god.

1925
02:22:36,860 --> 02:22:38,860
There was another hole.

1926
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:40,400
Oh wait.

1927
02:22:40,480 --> 02:22:42,260
No, we're going back to the main hole.

1928
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:43,640
This hole.

1929
02:22:44,260 --> 02:22:44,960
Was this the hole?

1930
02:23:27,730 --> 02:23:28,190
Oh dang.

1931
02:23:28,250 --> 02:23:29,450
I thought he was down for a second.

1932
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,160
God, guns really do suck in this game, huh?

1933
02:23:55,910 --> 02:23:57,290
They're just little monkeys.

1934
02:23:57,890 --> 02:24:00,490
Two little monkeys jumping on the bed.

1935
02:24:00,490 --> 02:24:03,790
One gets shot right in the head.

1936
02:24:08,970 --> 02:24:12,210
Mama went to the doctor and the doctor said...

1937
02:24:13,010 --> 02:24:15,490
No more monkeys jumping on the bed.

1938
02:24:15,770 --> 02:24:18,830
Oh god.

1939
02:24:30,150 --> 02:24:30,730
Watch your step.

1940
02:24:31,390 --> 02:24:32,230
Watch your step now.

1941
02:24:33,170 --> 02:24:34,390
Watch your step now.

1942
02:24:35,110 --> 02:24:35,950
Watch your step now.

1943
02:24:36,930 --> 02:24:38,010
Watch your step now.

1944
02:24:39,850 --> 02:24:41,690
Watch your step now.

1945
02:24:42,670 --> 02:24:43,890
Wait, did I go the wrong way?

1946
02:24:44,050 --> 02:24:45,010
Oh, I think I turned around.

1947
02:24:47,010 --> 02:24:48,770
Is the camera angle changed?

1948
02:24:49,090 --> 02:24:49,730
Okay, there we go.

1949
02:25:15,510 --> 02:25:16,350
Oh god.

1950
02:25:19,150 --> 02:25:21,490
How did this grow back so fast?

1951
02:25:25,250 --> 02:25:27,450
Time for the worst boss in the game.

1952
02:25:29,270 --> 02:25:29,870
Oops,

1953
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:37,280
my bad.

1954
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:41,100
Membrane.

1955
02:25:41,860 --> 02:25:43,620
Use the Ignis Fatus.

1956
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:47,460
Oh

1957
02:26:11,490 --> 02:26:12,510
god, he absorbs these.

1958
02:26:13,550 --> 02:26:15,130
I saw him do it earlier.

1959
02:26:15,490 --> 02:26:17,470
Or we saw it do it earlier.

1960
02:26:17,630 --> 02:26:18,290
That's right.

1961
02:26:18,810 --> 02:26:19,510
Oh my god.

1962
02:26:19,670 --> 02:26:20,090
No.

1963
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:21,530
What is this?

1964
02:26:21,530 --> 02:26:22,470
What are you doing?

1965
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:25,010
What are those?

1966
02:26:26,110 --> 02:26:26,930
Oh, okay.

1967
02:26:27,050 --> 02:26:27,610
I thought I...

1968
02:26:33,750 --> 02:26:36,490
I definitely don't feel confident.

1969
02:26:36,870 --> 02:26:38,050
What the hell are you doing?

1970
02:26:45,370 --> 02:26:46,330
And swing.

1971
02:26:46,570 --> 02:26:47,430
Swing, swing.

1972
02:26:47,550 --> 02:26:48,070
Oh, okay.

1973
02:26:48,130 --> 02:26:48,970
You can't swing though.

1974
02:27:04,890 --> 02:27:06,790
This boss sucks.

1975
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:11,810
This boss sucks.

1976
02:27:12,930 --> 02:27:16,050
All my DT and all my stuff.

1977
02:27:16,810 --> 02:27:17,930
This boss sucks.

1978
02:27:36,610 --> 02:27:39,470
You guys are just collateral damage to my jumps.

1979
02:27:39,870 --> 02:27:41,730
You guys are just collateral damage.

1980
02:27:41,790 --> 02:27:42,230
I'm sorry.

1981
02:27:45,010 --> 02:27:45,870
Okay, nice.

1982
02:27:46,310 --> 02:27:46,990
One down.

1983
02:27:49,370 --> 02:27:49,730
No!

1984
02:27:49,990 --> 02:27:50,710
My DT!

1985
02:27:56,260 --> 02:27:57,500
Are you kidding me?

1986
02:28:08,670 --> 02:28:09,230
What?

1987
02:28:15,450 --> 02:28:16,010
I

1988
02:28:22,470 --> 02:28:23,830
can only get him.

1989
02:28:26,850 --> 02:28:27,410
Wait.

1990
02:28:27,550 --> 02:28:27,810
Stop!

1991
02:28:30,370 --> 02:28:30,930
Stop!

1992
02:28:40,980 --> 02:28:41,540
DT!

1993
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:42,100
DT!

1994
02:28:48,700 --> 02:28:49,260
Ew.

1995
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:50,840
I gotta get him when his thing is hanging out.

1996
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:54,040
Reminds me of Butaro when he's licking his pink thing.

1997
02:29:07,210 --> 02:29:08,370
That's what he does.

1998
02:29:09,150 --> 02:29:10,350
I guess he cleans it.

1999
02:29:10,430 --> 02:29:10,770
I don't know.

2000
02:29:25,870 --> 02:29:26,270
Damn.

2001
02:30:09,810 --> 02:30:12,450
Where did all this DT come from for you to absorb, huh?

2002
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:23,700
Oh shit.

2003
02:30:32,090 --> 02:30:33,050
Oh my god.

2004
02:30:33,710 --> 02:30:35,030
I lost so much health there.

2005
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:11,260
I'm not gonna make it, you guys!

2006
02:31:25,510 --> 02:31:26,170
Shit me.

2007
02:31:26,450 --> 02:31:26,730
Shit.

2008
02:31:31,870 --> 02:31:33,710
Stop taking my DT, please.

2009
02:31:57,490 --> 02:31:59,110
Now he does the lasers!

2010
02:31:59,650 --> 02:32:01,830
Which I don't know if I like more or not.

2011
02:32:02,370 --> 02:32:03,770
Oh my god.

2012
02:32:06,850 --> 02:32:08,390
And he recovers health even?

2013
02:32:09,670 --> 02:32:10,910
Did he recover health?

2014
02:32:10,930 --> 02:32:11,530
I think he did.

2015
02:32:12,450 --> 02:32:13,930
Oh shit.

2016
02:32:15,170 --> 02:32:16,290
I hate this.

2017
02:32:16,610 --> 02:32:17,670
I don't want this anymore.

2018
02:32:18,190 --> 02:32:19,730
And he eats my...

2019
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:24,090
He eats my grorbs.

2020
02:32:24,510 --> 02:32:26,310
Which I don't get any grorbs.

2021
02:32:26,530 --> 02:32:30,470
He defeats those guys and he gets grorbs, but I defeat those guys and I get no grorbs!

2022
02:32:30,850 --> 02:32:32,630
What is this favoritism?

2023
02:32:33,770 --> 02:32:34,670
What is this favoritism?

2024
02:32:37,930 --> 02:32:42,390
I wasted my... I wasted my... Wait, I don't have it anymore, right?

2025
02:32:45,130 --> 02:32:45,610
Nope.

2026
02:32:45,810 --> 02:32:46,650
My vital star.

2027
02:32:54,320 --> 02:32:56,960
So yeah, the guy on the left...

2028
02:32:58,320 --> 02:33:03,360
I think we have to just stick with the guy on the left.

2029
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:06,300
Because we can't have him...

2030
02:33:06,980 --> 02:33:10,660
We can't have him healing.

2031
02:33:12,300 --> 02:33:13,200
I think.

2032
02:33:25,210 --> 02:33:26,810
I think...

2033
02:33:26,810 --> 02:33:28,090
I think it's okay.

2034
02:33:34,180 --> 02:33:34,980
Because...

2035
02:33:35,300 --> 02:33:37,960
Let me see if I can purchase anything.

2036
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:39,320
Oh whoops.

2037
02:33:43,690 --> 02:33:46,230
I can't buy... I could buy another plorb.

2038
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:46,710
Plorb.

2039
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:11,800
My biggest concern... I don't mind if he eats the grorbs and does the lasers.

2040
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:14,120
My biggest concern is him healing.

2041
02:34:16,100 --> 02:34:19,640
But I guess if we just do more damage with the DT...

2042
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:21,780
Then he could...

2043
02:34:26,750 --> 02:34:29,550
If we do more damage with the DT then he can heal.

2044
02:34:29,630 --> 02:34:30,330
It might be okay.

2045
02:34:33,970 --> 02:34:35,790
He's gotta stick his thing out more.

2046
02:34:36,710 --> 02:34:39,310
He's gotta stick his thing out more so I can hit it.

2047
02:34:47,450 --> 02:34:49,850
Let's try it with... Okay, hold on.

2048
02:34:53,170 --> 02:34:53,650
Alright.

2049
02:34:57,790 --> 02:34:58,750
And then...

2050
02:34:58,750 --> 02:35:00,770
I'm going to focus on the right guy.

2051
02:35:02,530 --> 02:35:04,070
This guy over here.

2052
02:35:04,470 --> 02:35:05,770
We're gonna focus on him.

2053
02:35:12,720 --> 02:35:14,080
Make this fast.

2054
02:35:23,550 --> 02:35:26,150
I wish I landed any of those shots.

2055
02:35:30,030 --> 02:35:30,970
So funny.

2056
02:35:32,940 --> 02:35:36,460
And to make it all worse, you gotta have so many of these guys.

2057
02:35:47,450 --> 02:35:48,910
Wait, is he still alive?

2058
02:35:49,730 --> 02:35:50,570
There we go.

2059
02:35:52,970 --> 02:35:53,470
His thing!

2060
02:36:10,390 --> 02:36:11,430
You guys!

2061
02:36:11,570 --> 02:36:13,170
We leveled up our style!

2062
02:36:15,590 --> 02:36:19,190
Hold down R, then press A while holding forward.

2063
02:36:22,050 --> 02:36:23,050
Oh, dang it.

2064
02:36:45,340 --> 02:36:46,640
Oh my goodness.

2065
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:36,050
He didn't do the laser beam.

2066
02:37:38,470 --> 02:37:39,390
Oh, he's still absorbing.

2067
02:37:39,710 --> 02:37:40,250
Oh, there it is.

2068
02:37:41,730 --> 02:37:42,350
Ouch!

2069
02:37:42,610 --> 02:37:43,610
I tried to jump!

2070
02:37:54,270 --> 02:37:55,170
Oh shoot.

2071
02:37:56,210 --> 02:37:56,830
Oh god.

2072
02:38:22,810 --> 02:38:24,050
Screw it.

2073
02:38:27,990 --> 02:38:30,230
Maybe that was a mistake, but I needed the health.

2074
02:38:34,030 --> 02:38:35,610
I mistimed it.

2075
02:38:35,790 --> 02:38:37,530
There's like a little break in between.

2076
02:38:40,270 --> 02:38:42,810
Oh, that's why I don't like the...

2077
02:38:43,310 --> 02:38:46,810
That's why I don't like the lasers because they are stronger than...

2078
02:38:46,810 --> 02:38:49,710
Well, I never get hit by the orbs because they are so slow.

2079
02:38:52,290 --> 02:38:53,150
I don't know.

2080
02:38:53,250 --> 02:38:54,870
Does this style upgrade carry over?

2081
02:38:55,150 --> 02:38:58,310
Ok, so it was forward A?

2082
02:38:59,550 --> 02:39:00,490
Is that it?

2083
02:39:02,410 --> 02:39:03,110
That's it?

2084
02:39:11,170 --> 02:39:12,550
I'm confused.

2085
02:39:13,170 --> 02:39:14,990
It just throws your sword.

2086
02:39:17,630 --> 02:39:18,430
Check

2087
02:39:24,890 --> 02:39:26,010
the style.

2088
02:39:27,610 --> 02:39:28,410
Files.

2089
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:36,220
Sword Master.

2090
02:39:37,380 --> 02:39:38,300
Sword Pierce.

2091
02:39:40,900 --> 02:39:43,600
Curl your sword at the enemy, skewering them with it.

2092
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:45,400
R, L, A.

2093
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:52,960
Oh, but that's not what I meant.

2094
02:39:54,100 --> 02:39:56,880
Ok, but...

2095
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:58,600
How does that...

2096
02:40:02,920 --> 02:40:07,500
Will that interfere with...

2097
02:40:09,500 --> 02:40:10,700
Scroll down.

2098
02:40:12,520 --> 02:40:13,980
The flicker.

2099
02:40:16,980 --> 02:40:18,240
Oh, let's see.

2100
02:40:18,580 --> 02:40:19,820
What, the million carats?

2101
02:40:21,060 --> 02:40:23,500
Repeatedly press A while executing the crystal.

2102
02:40:25,780 --> 02:40:28,540
Slam your nunchucks into the ground to create a huge glacier.

2103
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:33,020
And then crawler.

2104
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:41,100
Attack far away enemies by plunging your swords into the ground to roll out a large carpet of flame in their direction.

2105
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:44,000
Ok, I might be a little too slow for this.

2106
02:40:44,500 --> 02:40:46,260
But maybe this would be good.

2107
02:40:46,420 --> 02:40:47,300
Hold on, let's try it.

2108
02:40:52,160 --> 02:40:53,400
Wait, sorry, what was it?

2109
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:55,440
What did I need to do?

2110
02:40:56,400 --> 02:40:57,320
Was it R?

2111
02:40:59,380 --> 02:40:59,780
Ah,

2112
02:41:05,620 --> 02:41:06,520
I got it, I got it.

2113
02:41:07,560 --> 02:41:07,960
Nope.

2114
02:41:09,460 --> 02:41:09,860
Nope.

2115
02:41:11,020 --> 02:41:11,780
There we go.

2116
02:41:12,920 --> 02:41:14,400
Two on this.

2117
02:41:21,560 --> 02:41:24,160
I wonder if it's too slow though.

2118
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:30,260
Smash it?

2119
02:41:30,380 --> 02:41:30,440
Ok.

2120
02:41:42,340 --> 02:41:43,540
Let's try it.

2121
02:41:47,780 --> 02:41:48,960
That's so mean.

2122
02:41:49,560 --> 02:41:52,400
What if I was just like, oh no, wait, I'm gonna buy a thing.

2123
02:41:52,520 --> 02:41:53,700
They wouldn't let me.

2124
02:41:54,320 --> 02:41:55,880
They don't want me to spend my money.

2125
02:41:56,740 --> 02:41:58,060
Ok, fine game.

2126
02:41:58,760 --> 02:42:00,040
Two on this.

2127
02:42:00,700 --> 02:42:01,780
Two on this.

2128
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:03,160
It's cool.

2129
02:42:03,620 --> 02:42:04,580
Two on this.

2130
02:42:05,320 --> 02:42:06,220
It's cool.

2131
02:42:06,500 --> 02:42:07,380
Two on this.

2132
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:08,860
It's cool.

2133
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:10,280
Two on this.

2134
02:42:11,020 --> 02:42:11,760
It's cool.

2135
02:42:11,780 --> 02:42:12,160
On

2136
02:42:18,330 --> 02:42:18,610
this.

2137
02:42:18,910 --> 02:42:19,290
It's cool.

2138
02:42:24,100 --> 02:42:25,180
Holy shit.

2139
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:31,220
I just noticed it was...

2140
02:42:31,220 --> 02:42:32,420
No, the pink thing!

2141
02:42:32,680 --> 02:42:33,420
I mean the green thing.

2142
02:42:34,380 --> 02:42:35,640
Two on this.

2143
02:42:40,330 --> 02:42:41,390
You know what, it's fine.

2144
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:01,320
Wow, it's so good.

2145
02:43:23,450 --> 02:43:24,210
It's cool.

2146
02:43:24,990 --> 02:43:25,690
Two on this.

2147
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:31,450
Oh shit.

2148
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:37,980
Did I get hit?

2149
02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:44,730
It's not letting me double trigger.

2150
02:43:44,810 --> 02:43:45,150
There we go.

2151
02:43:51,870 --> 02:43:52,330
Oh

2152
02:43:57,730 --> 02:43:59,670
no, I need to get into the combo.

2153
02:43:59,670 --> 02:43:59,750
Combo.

2154
02:44:05,960 --> 02:44:06,720
There we go.

2155
02:44:07,700 --> 02:44:08,180
There we go.

2156
02:44:09,140 --> 02:44:09,620
There we go.

2157
02:44:16,100 --> 02:44:17,400
Ah shit, shit, shit.

2158
02:44:21,550 --> 02:44:22,010
Oh no, no.

2159
02:44:27,730 --> 02:44:28,170
Ok.

2160
02:44:28,930 --> 02:44:29,730
Run away.

2161
02:44:36,130 --> 02:44:37,010
It's cool.

2162
02:44:37,730 --> 02:44:38,550
It's cool.

2163
02:44:38,970 --> 02:44:39,530
Two on this.

2164
02:44:39,570 --> 02:44:39,930
It's cool.

2165
02:44:40,030 --> 02:44:40,390
Oh shit.

2166
02:44:44,490 --> 02:44:46,650
It really sucks not having double jump there.

2167
02:44:46,850 --> 02:44:47,410
On this.

2168
02:44:47,830 --> 02:44:48,210
Honestly.

2169
02:44:50,210 --> 02:44:50,770
Oh

2170
02:44:57,610 --> 02:45:00,650
my god, all these lasers are gonna actually be the death of me.

2171
02:45:05,130 --> 02:45:06,150
We're so close.

2172
02:45:06,570 --> 02:45:07,730
We're so close, please.

2173
02:45:08,250 --> 02:45:09,150
We're so close.

2174
02:45:09,630 --> 02:45:10,970
We're so close.

2175
02:45:11,770 --> 02:45:14,590
Oh my god, we're so close.

2176
02:45:24,660 --> 02:45:25,980
Ah, bitch.

2177
02:45:26,580 --> 02:45:27,160
Leave me alone.

2178
02:45:28,140 --> 02:45:28,700
And

2179
02:45:35,350 --> 02:45:36,430
jump to avoid it.

2180
02:45:43,110 --> 02:45:43,770
Ahahaha.

2181
02:45:46,110 --> 02:45:48,130
Good job guys, we did it.

2182
02:45:48,230 --> 02:45:48,470
Yeah.

2183
02:45:49,370 --> 02:45:50,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2184
02:45:51,510 --> 02:45:53,890
I love, I love being cool.

2185
02:45:56,870 --> 02:45:58,550
Thanks for the new strap, Minto.

2186
02:45:58,870 --> 02:45:59,710
I got you.

2187
02:46:00,890 --> 02:46:02,270
The Minto strap.

2188
02:46:02,830 --> 02:46:04,070
Just be minty fresh.

2189
02:46:05,190 --> 02:46:05,850
Minty cool.

2190
02:46:11,530 --> 02:46:12,610
Merry early Christmas.

2191
02:46:12,870 --> 02:46:13,910
Thanks Gordon Freeman.

2192
02:46:14,970 --> 02:46:16,370
Thank you so much.

2193
02:46:16,570 --> 02:46:17,930
Merry early Christmas.

2194
02:46:25,570 --> 02:46:27,390
I don't think Virgil cares.

2195
02:46:29,690 --> 02:46:31,370
You yap too much.

2196
02:46:41,190 --> 02:46:43,270
He just felt his pet die.

2197
02:46:44,070 --> 02:46:46,070
In his soul, he's like my little buddy.

2198
02:46:48,830 --> 02:46:49,930
Are they in hell?

2199
02:46:50,890 --> 02:46:51,230
Real?

2200
02:46:52,210 --> 02:46:53,670
Minto is the fresh maker.

2201
02:47:02,950 --> 02:47:05,370
Virgil, I didn't order a yappuccino.

2202
02:47:06,890 --> 02:47:09,290
Oh my gosh, I got S amount of orbs.

2203
02:47:14,850 --> 02:47:15,330
Dispida.

2204
02:47:16,110 --> 02:47:16,590
Dispida.

2205
02:47:17,370 --> 02:47:19,230
Sub to Mint, she is cool.

2206
02:47:22,230 --> 02:47:22,710
Nice.

2207
02:47:27,550 --> 02:47:30,250
So we are on mission 9.

2208
02:47:30,890 --> 02:47:32,310
Wait, I didn't see the 8.

2209
02:47:33,310 --> 02:47:34,310
In that last one.

2210
02:47:34,430 --> 02:47:35,830
I keep forgetting to look sometimes.

2211
02:47:38,610 --> 02:47:39,750
I keep forgetting to look.

2212
02:47:41,290 --> 02:47:43,010
Let's see, how long have I been at it?

2213
02:47:45,550 --> 02:47:47,790
How is the next mission looking?

2214
02:47:55,220 --> 02:47:56,760
Or is 8 in here?

2215
02:47:58,300 --> 02:47:59,780
Is 8 in this cutscene?

2216
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:01,360
I can't remember.

2217
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:05,060
I'm looking.

2218
02:48:09,240 --> 02:48:10,680
Oh, it will be 9.

2219
02:48:11,360 --> 02:48:13,900
So it's at the beginning cutscene, not the end cutscene?

2220
02:48:18,230 --> 02:48:19,530
Yeah, I did that.

2221
02:48:19,790 --> 02:48:21,490
Wait, is that the 9 with the eye?

2222
02:48:28,370 --> 02:48:28,930
No?

2223
02:48:29,170 --> 02:48:29,970
Oh, it's more obvious.

2224
02:48:30,430 --> 02:48:32,970
I thought I did something there.

2225
02:48:35,250 --> 02:48:37,350
I thought I was really like...

2226
02:48:37,350 --> 02:48:39,650
I cooked.

2227
02:48:42,250 --> 02:48:42,810
Cool.

2228
02:48:44,850 --> 02:48:46,530
Oh no, not this guy.

2229
02:48:47,370 --> 02:48:48,890
The actual clown.

2230
02:48:51,190 --> 02:48:52,510
Next stage.

2231
02:49:10,370 --> 02:49:13,910
He stinks like a lot worse, I'm telling you girl.

2232
02:49:18,050 --> 02:49:19,450
Oh!

2233
02:49:22,530 --> 02:49:23,910
Power couple.

2234
02:49:29,290 --> 02:49:31,210
Alright lady.

2235
02:49:39,960 --> 02:49:42,760
The party.

2236
02:50:02,080 --> 02:50:03,220
Missed it!

2237
02:50:03,320 --> 02:50:03,660
Missed it!

2238
02:50:03,660 --> 02:50:04,080
Dang it!

2239
02:50:07,930 --> 02:50:09,930
I missed the 9!

2240
02:50:11,450 --> 02:50:13,370
No, I saw the 9.

2241
02:50:13,810 --> 02:50:15,590
In my soul.

2242
02:50:15,950 --> 02:50:16,910
Well, I am a soul.

2243
02:50:17,250 --> 02:50:18,130
In my heart.

2244
02:50:19,850 --> 02:50:21,070
You are laughing too hard.

2245
02:50:21,150 --> 02:50:21,650
I was.

2246
02:50:22,330 --> 02:50:25,350
Christen the sorceress of the abyss with the blade.

2247
02:50:26,690 --> 02:50:28,890
Shouldn't I get to know her a little bit first?

2248
02:50:30,510 --> 02:50:32,730
Guys, how long do you think this one will take me?

2249
02:50:32,870 --> 02:50:33,550
Actually, no.

2250
02:50:33,670 --> 02:50:34,310
I think I can do it.

2251
02:50:34,410 --> 02:50:34,690
Let's go.

2252
02:50:35,890 --> 02:50:37,830
How much rorb do I have?

2253
02:50:39,910 --> 02:50:40,710
11,000.

2254
02:50:49,400 --> 02:50:50,740
Buy another plorb.

2255
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:55,160
Boss hard, but weak to ice.

2256
02:51:03,500 --> 02:51:04,680
Save for plorb.

2257
02:51:08,340 --> 02:51:09,600
Can't be short, be a gamer.

2258
02:51:13,460 --> 02:51:15,320
Plorb equals DT, which also heals you.

2259
02:51:18,760 --> 02:51:21,360
I just want to keep buying this guy, because look at him.

2260
02:51:24,220 --> 02:51:25,480
This guy looks miserable.

2261
02:51:25,980 --> 02:51:26,920
I don't want to buy him.

2262
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:27,860
I don't want to invite him.

2263
02:51:27,860 --> 02:51:29,380
I want to invite this guy.

2264
02:51:29,560 --> 02:51:31,040
He's ready to cause mischief.

2265
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:34,020
Yeah, baby.

2266
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:35,660
Okay, let's try it.

2267
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:41,480
I... am nervous.

2268
02:51:42,560 --> 02:51:44,280
Because I can't go for too much longer.

2269
02:51:44,780 --> 02:51:46,100
I got some stuff I need to do.

2270
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:49,720
But...

2271
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:51,640
I will attempt.

2272
02:51:52,400 --> 02:51:53,860
If I can't finish it...

2273
02:51:55,320 --> 02:51:58,300
Within a reasonable amount of time, I will just save it for next time.

2274
02:51:59,220 --> 02:52:00,200
No worries.

2275
02:52:02,940 --> 02:52:04,600
Provisions, store room.

2276
02:52:05,160 --> 02:52:06,300
Wow, this room is...

2277
02:52:06,680 --> 02:52:09,100
I was going to say, this room is fancy.

2278
02:52:13,910 --> 02:52:14,970
Is this the lady?

2279
02:52:19,010 --> 02:52:19,530
Ladies?

2280
02:52:20,710 --> 02:52:21,990
Ladies, ladies.

2281
02:52:23,450 --> 02:52:23,790
Wait.

2282
02:52:42,850 --> 02:52:44,090
Oh my god, they're fast.

2283
02:52:45,270 --> 02:52:45,790
Got

2284
02:52:53,680 --> 02:52:54,660
got by the door.

2285
02:53:06,040 --> 02:53:06,920
Did I kill him?

2286
02:53:08,220 --> 02:53:09,280
Oh, they're babies!

2287
02:53:09,780 --> 02:53:11,100
Oh, they have little babies!

2288
02:53:14,600 --> 02:53:16,400
Oh my god, get away from the door, Dante!

2289
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:18,860
Oh,

2290
02:53:25,710 --> 02:53:25,990
goodness.

2291
02:53:29,530 --> 02:53:30,790
Gary loves you.

2292
02:53:31,190 --> 02:53:32,190
Don't say that.

2293
02:53:33,630 --> 02:53:34,110
Ew.

2294
02:53:38,690 --> 02:53:39,350
No, no, no.

2295
02:53:39,370 --> 02:53:40,330
I knew she was going to do that.

2296
02:53:58,730 --> 02:54:00,570
She's all sexy on that wall.

2297
02:54:09,060 --> 02:54:10,860
And... there's little babies though.

2298
02:54:17,110 --> 02:54:18,310
Oh, oh god!

2299
02:54:21,370 --> 02:54:22,050
Gun?

2300
02:54:22,490 --> 02:54:23,210
Oh, true.

2301
02:54:25,130 --> 02:54:26,450
Oh wait, this one.

2302
02:54:31,070 --> 02:54:32,410
We did it.

2303
02:54:34,350 --> 02:54:35,590
Poor little babies.

2304
02:54:35,670 --> 02:54:36,430
What about me?

2305
02:54:37,890 --> 02:54:39,130
Aren't I your poor baby?

2306
02:54:40,430 --> 02:54:41,130
What is this?

2307
02:54:43,350 --> 02:54:44,470
It's a puzzle.

2308
02:54:59,790 --> 02:55:01,050
Poor little Minky.

2309
02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:05,210
Don't pity me.

2310
02:55:08,230 --> 02:55:09,870
Oh, no, I did not mean to do that.

2311
02:55:09,970 --> 02:55:10,750
Sorry, my hand slipped.

2312
02:55:10,850 --> 02:55:11,310
What is this?

2313
02:55:13,290 --> 02:55:16,950
Radiate the image sunken in the depths below to open a new path.

2314
02:55:26,670 --> 02:55:30,010
I'm guessing I have to do this once I...

2315
02:55:31,610 --> 02:55:32,370
Ok.

2316
02:55:33,890 --> 02:55:37,010
I'm guessing I have to figure out something and then...

2317
02:55:44,690 --> 02:55:46,170
The wheel resets it.

2318
02:55:48,050 --> 02:55:48,810
Stupid,

2319
02:55:56,730 --> 02:55:57,670
stupid game.

2320
02:55:58,130 --> 02:55:59,970
I can't handle my brain.

2321
02:56:06,990 --> 02:56:07,750
No.

2322
02:56:08,810 --> 02:56:09,190
No!

2323
02:56:41,290 --> 02:56:42,830
Do I need to go over there?

2324
02:56:46,330 --> 02:56:47,510
Where did you come from?

2325
02:56:48,530 --> 02:56:50,730
He showed me how to get there.

2326
02:56:55,170 --> 02:56:55,730
Anyway.

2327
02:56:59,450 --> 02:57:01,910
They are still trying, dummies.

2328
02:57:02,430 --> 02:57:03,290
What is this right here?

2329
02:57:09,410 --> 02:57:10,350
Ok, ok.

2330
02:57:39,700 --> 02:57:43,070
There is a door right in front of me.

2331
02:57:48,570 --> 02:57:49,670
What's in here?

2332
02:57:51,750 --> 02:57:52,970
God, no.

2333
02:57:53,550 --> 02:57:54,610
Please spare me.

2334
02:58:14,520 --> 02:58:15,980
Chew on this.

2335
02:58:16,580 --> 02:58:17,640
It's cool.

2336
02:58:18,440 --> 02:58:19,440
Chew on this.

2337
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:21,040
It's cool.

2338
02:58:22,240 --> 02:58:23,460
I got a white orb.

2339
02:58:25,900 --> 02:58:27,080
I got another.

2340
02:58:51,380 --> 02:58:52,620
It's cool.

2341
02:58:53,340 --> 02:58:54,800
Chew on this.

2342
02:58:55,420 --> 02:58:56,320
It's cool.

2343
02:58:56,720 --> 02:58:58,340
Chew on this.

2344
02:58:58,800 --> 02:58:59,500
It's cool.

2345
02:59:02,110 --> 02:59:03,490
It's cool, isn't it?

2346
02:59:06,310 --> 02:59:07,710
Dante didn't care.

2347
02:59:12,090 --> 02:59:14,650
Try the...oh yeah, that's right.

2348
02:59:14,810 --> 02:59:15,370
What was theirs?

2349
02:59:16,350 --> 02:59:17,470
It's probably...wait.

2350
02:59:17,730 --> 02:59:18,910
Just kidding.

2351
02:59:25,890 --> 02:59:27,010
Stoil.

2352
02:59:30,630 --> 02:59:31,170
Hello?

2353
02:59:33,130 --> 02:59:34,250
Stoil.

2354
02:59:34,870 --> 02:59:35,530
Sword Master.

2355
02:59:37,770 --> 02:59:38,550
Oh, Crawler.

2356
02:59:40,810 --> 02:59:42,110
R-L-O.

2357
02:59:49,950 --> 02:59:51,870
If I spam it...

2358
03:00:01,790 --> 03:00:02,590
No talking.

2359
03:00:02,850 --> 03:00:04,910
Yeah, they're pretty noisy here.

2360
03:00:09,010 --> 03:00:11,630
They're pretty...they're saying a lot.

2361
03:00:15,770 --> 03:00:16,170
Okay.

2362
03:00:27,170 --> 03:00:28,190
They're...oh, not a lot.

2363
03:00:28,330 --> 03:00:28,870
Okay, just kidding.

2364
03:00:35,180 --> 03:00:37,200
I don't want to go in there quite yet.

2365
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:39,240
I want to look around in here.

2366
03:00:40,660 --> 03:00:41,260
Orb.

2367
03:00:56,280 --> 03:00:56,900
Oh, hi.

2368
03:01:17,860 --> 03:01:19,100
They were just chill.

2369
03:01:24,650 --> 03:01:25,850
Not chill.

2370
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:41,860
Not chill.

2371
03:01:43,260 --> 03:01:46,520
Wait, do they keep respawning because I'm bothering them now?

2372
03:01:46,520 --> 03:01:47,480
Oh no.

2373
03:01:47,900 --> 03:01:48,740
Did I mess up?

2374
03:01:53,850 --> 03:01:54,450
Wait.

2375
03:01:56,550 --> 03:01:58,110
Will it work if I leave?

2376
03:02:07,410 --> 03:02:08,430
What's in here?

2377
03:02:08,550 --> 03:02:10,150
Oh, I guess we'll find out.

2378
03:02:14,300 --> 03:02:15,380
A Devil Star!

2379
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:16,740
I'll take it.

2380
03:02:31,210 --> 03:02:34,590
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

2381
03:02:35,290 --> 03:02:37,490
I want to live.

2382
03:02:40,050 --> 03:02:41,190
Is

2383
03:02:52,630 --> 03:02:55,250
that a lady crossing her legs?

2384
03:02:56,650 --> 03:03:01,030
A relic of a...

2385
03:03:01,030 --> 03:03:05,210
A nude...a nude female is carved on the door.

2386
03:03:06,250 --> 03:03:06,470
Naked?

2387
03:03:07,930 --> 03:03:09,050
Oh la la.

2388
03:03:09,870 --> 03:03:12,270
It looks like something can be placed in the woman's hand.

2389
03:03:12,910 --> 03:03:13,950
Oh, I don't have that yet.

2390
03:03:14,910 --> 03:03:16,290
Okay, I came in here for no reason.

2391
03:03:19,650 --> 03:03:20,190
See ya.

2392
03:03:21,170 --> 03:03:22,130
Wait, what's over there?

2393
03:03:22,970 --> 03:03:25,070
How do I...how do I get to that spot?

2394
03:03:27,730 --> 03:03:28,110
Wait.

2395
03:03:32,250 --> 03:03:33,530
Do I need to chew on this?

2396
03:03:33,550 --> 03:03:34,030
It's cool.

2397
03:03:36,250 --> 03:03:37,630
How do I get to the door?

2398
03:04:04,640 --> 03:04:05,480
Oh, later.

2399
03:04:06,260 --> 03:04:08,900
Okay, I thought it was the thing that I needed to put in her hand.

2400
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:10,920
That's why I was going towards it.

2401
03:04:11,540 --> 03:04:12,680
Okay, we'll leave.

2402
03:04:13,400 --> 03:04:14,600
Bye bye everybody.

2403
03:04:15,800 --> 03:04:16,700
Bye bye.

2404
03:04:17,840 --> 03:04:18,400
Bye bye.

2405
03:04:34,710 --> 03:04:35,230
Oh,

2406
03:04:42,850 --> 03:04:43,410
they interact?

2407
03:04:43,950 --> 03:04:44,290
Wait.

2408
03:04:45,890 --> 03:04:47,390
Am I supposed to interact with these?

2409
03:04:48,830 --> 03:04:50,050
How am I supposed to know?

2410
03:04:50,250 --> 03:04:51,510
Don't act like I'm stupid.

2411
03:04:52,030 --> 03:04:54,390
I know I am, but...

2412
03:04:56,250 --> 03:05:00,910
How does she not know to interact with the glowing crystals that look like they would be...

2413
03:05:00,910 --> 03:05:03,430
that look like they would be breakables?

2414
03:05:04,450 --> 03:05:07,850
Destroy every destructible background object within the time limit.

2415
03:05:20,720 --> 03:05:21,440
Oh.

2416
03:05:29,610 --> 03:05:32,130
What is the best to do here?

2417
03:05:33,090 --> 03:05:33,650
What item?

2418
03:05:36,350 --> 03:05:38,410
It's just one of those days.

2419
03:05:41,710 --> 03:05:42,430
Oh no!

2420
03:05:43,270 --> 03:05:44,170
I'm only at 37!

2421
03:05:54,160 --> 03:05:56,000
What's the best...

2422
03:05:58,720 --> 03:05:59,740
What's the best weapon?

2423
03:05:59,880 --> 03:06:00,580
Maybe this one.

2424
03:06:01,080 --> 03:06:01,800
Let's try it.

2425
03:06:06,450 --> 03:06:07,790
I already feel faster.

2426
03:06:10,750 --> 03:06:13,510
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit.

2427
03:06:14,510 --> 03:06:16,990
I think you better quit letting shit slip.

2428
03:06:18,710 --> 03:06:21,410
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit.

2429
03:06:22,470 --> 03:06:25,890
I think you better quit talking that shit pun.

2430
03:06:26,110 --> 03:06:27,290
So come and get it.

2431
03:06:27,910 --> 03:06:29,890
I feel like shit.

2432
03:06:30,770 --> 03:06:33,630
My suggestion is to keep your distance.

2433
03:06:33,790 --> 03:06:35,490
Because right now I'm dangerous.

2434
03:06:36,190 --> 03:06:38,290
We've all felt like shit.

2435
03:06:38,670 --> 03:06:40,570
Where is the rest of it?

2436
03:06:40,970 --> 03:06:42,830
All those motherfuckers.

2437
03:06:42,970 --> 03:06:44,430
I only have three more.

2438
03:06:49,930 --> 03:06:50,650
Up top.

2439
03:06:52,450 --> 03:06:53,370
Go up top.

2440
03:06:55,150 --> 03:06:56,150
So close.

2441
03:06:57,330 --> 03:06:57,850
Oh my god.

2442
03:06:57,990 --> 03:06:59,430
Dante, I need you to run buddy.

2443
03:06:59,750 --> 03:07:03,830
I need you to do all these moves and like...

2444
03:07:05,910 --> 03:07:07,610
That's not as good as I thought it was.

2445
03:07:09,410 --> 03:07:10,710
There we go.

2446
03:07:16,330 --> 03:07:17,370
Faster, faster.

2447
03:07:17,590 --> 03:07:18,270
Faster Dante!

2448
03:07:23,570 --> 03:07:24,690
No, faster Dante!

2449
03:07:24,950 --> 03:07:25,710
I'm not gonna make it.

2450
03:07:25,850 --> 03:07:26,470
I'm not gonna make it.

2451
03:07:36,810 --> 03:07:37,590
I feel

2452
03:07:40,980 --> 03:07:45,340
like we can do this though.

2453
03:07:48,960 --> 03:07:53,440
But he gets so slow when he like... I don't know.

2454
03:07:57,300 --> 03:07:58,340
No, no, no.

2455
03:07:58,460 --> 03:07:58,920
Turn around.

2456
03:07:59,400 --> 03:07:59,840
There we go.

2457
03:08:02,360 --> 03:08:03,220
Get up there.

2458
03:08:05,440 --> 03:08:06,360
Come on, come on.

2459
03:08:06,960 --> 03:08:09,040
Don't have time for styles.

2460
03:08:09,820 --> 03:08:10,920
Come on Dante!

2461
03:08:11,240 --> 03:08:12,180
We don't have time for styles.

2462
03:08:12,660 --> 03:08:13,080
There we go.

2463
03:08:20,320 --> 03:08:21,520
Wait, I'm missing one.

2464
03:08:21,820 --> 03:08:22,420
What am I missing?

2465
03:08:24,140 --> 03:08:25,240
What did I miss?

2466
03:08:27,020 --> 03:08:28,180
What did I miss?

2467
03:08:41,510 --> 03:08:43,790
I missed a single bottle?

2468
03:08:44,010 --> 03:08:44,870
No way.

2469
03:08:46,750 --> 03:08:47,890
Oh my god, please.

2470
03:09:06,130 --> 03:09:07,070
Are you sure?

2471
03:09:15,820 --> 03:09:17,300
I'm still missing one.

2472
03:09:17,300 --> 03:09:19,800
I don't think it was a bottle.

2473
03:09:23,540 --> 03:09:24,020
I

2474
03:09:36,140 --> 03:09:37,100
don't know what I missed.

2475
03:09:38,660 --> 03:09:39,880
Maybe the taxidermy?

2476
03:09:39,960 --> 03:09:40,900
Let's try and see.

2477
03:09:41,580 --> 03:09:42,720
Where is the taxidermy?

2478
03:09:42,780 --> 03:09:46,500
Hold on, this is just the exploration round.

2479
03:09:47,540 --> 03:09:48,800
Where is the taxidermy?

2480
03:09:51,500 --> 03:09:52,460
Oh, up there?

2481
03:09:55,640 --> 03:09:56,120
No.

2482
03:09:56,120 --> 03:09:56,260
No.

2483
03:10:07,590 --> 03:10:09,070
What is it?

2484
03:10:16,770 --> 03:10:19,030
A barrel up by the deer's head.

2485
03:10:20,450 --> 03:10:21,990
I got those though.

2486
03:10:22,490 --> 03:10:23,470
No, I got those.

2487
03:10:28,420 --> 03:10:31,480
I missed a stool next to the table.

2488
03:10:43,090 --> 03:10:44,630
Oh, that!

2489
03:10:44,630 --> 03:10:44,790
That!

2490
03:10:50,520 --> 03:10:51,580
Oh my god, please.

2491
03:10:51,920 --> 03:10:52,200
Dante.

2492
03:10:54,980 --> 03:10:56,120
Oh my god, OK.

2493
03:10:58,560 --> 03:10:59,120
OK.

2494
03:11:00,100 --> 03:11:01,140
I wasted time.

2495
03:11:02,020 --> 03:11:03,440
Oh no, I'm not gonna make it.

2496
03:11:03,740 --> 03:11:04,220
Damn it.

2497
03:11:05,460 --> 03:11:06,020
Dante!

2498
03:11:06,780 --> 03:11:07,340
Dante!

2499
03:11:07,960 --> 03:11:08,620
You bastard!

2500
03:11:11,980 --> 03:11:13,720
No, I still had three left!

2501
03:11:13,720 --> 03:11:14,460
What?

2502
03:11:14,940 --> 03:11:16,700
No, it's not the stool.

2503
03:11:18,120 --> 03:11:19,820
I still had three left!

2504
03:11:20,260 --> 03:11:21,960
I still have three left.

2505
03:11:22,120 --> 03:11:22,480
What?

2506
03:11:25,840 --> 03:11:27,660
No guys, I didn't have it.

2507
03:11:27,780 --> 03:11:30,840
There is only two barrels over here.

2508
03:11:33,160 --> 03:11:34,260
There is only two.

2509
03:11:34,400 --> 03:11:35,540
I wouldn't have had it.

2510
03:11:39,340 --> 03:11:40,440
It is the stool.

2511
03:11:40,540 --> 03:11:41,460
No, it's not.

2512
03:11:41,600 --> 03:11:42,580
I'm telling you.

2513
03:11:44,980 --> 03:11:46,600
I'm telling you, it's not.

2514
03:11:51,620 --> 03:11:53,140
See, I get the stool.

2515
03:12:02,940 --> 03:12:05,900
One of the barrels behind the slots was still alive.

2516
03:12:07,380 --> 03:12:08,520
I see, I see.

2517
03:12:11,500 --> 03:12:14,240
OK, this is my last time trying because I'm getting bored of it.

2518
03:12:17,300 --> 03:12:18,220
I'm getting bored.

2519
03:12:30,140 --> 03:12:31,100
Come on Dante!

2520
03:12:31,340 --> 03:12:31,640
Dante!

2521
03:12:31,960 --> 03:12:32,320
No!

2522
03:12:32,480 --> 03:12:34,700
I fucking hate you, you stupid ass!

2523
03:12:35,320 --> 03:12:36,660
You're so dumb Dante!

2524
03:12:37,040 --> 03:12:38,600
You're gonna make me lose!

2525
03:12:41,400 --> 03:12:41,960
Nevermind.

2526
03:12:42,120 --> 03:12:42,240
OK.

2527
03:12:42,820 --> 03:12:43,380
Leave.

2528
03:12:43,520 --> 03:12:43,920
Leave.

2529
03:12:44,140 --> 03:12:44,420
Leave.

2530
03:12:44,720 --> 03:12:45,240
Leave.

2531
03:12:46,160 --> 03:12:46,720
Leave!

2532
03:12:47,620 --> 03:12:48,760
Barrel behind the bar.

2533
03:12:48,840 --> 03:12:50,420
We're not even gonna make it you guys.

2534
03:12:50,520 --> 03:12:53,240
Because Dante didn't wanna fucking jump up because he sucks.

2535
03:12:53,240 --> 03:12:56,760
At least I'm far... Actually, I'm getting a lot of robs from this.

2536
03:12:57,080 --> 03:12:58,040
It's kinda great.

2537
03:13:08,530 --> 03:13:13,110
I feel like... I feel like the Nunchucks should be hitting a lot more things than it does.

2538
03:13:14,230 --> 03:13:15,150
You know what I mean?

2539
03:13:20,230 --> 03:13:20,710
OK.

2540
03:13:21,030 --> 03:13:21,410
Nice!

2541
03:13:23,470 --> 03:13:23,950
Nice!

2542
03:13:24,170 --> 03:13:24,170
Nice!

2543
03:13:24,250 --> 03:13:24,390
Nice!

2544
03:13:24,390 --> 03:13:24,490
Nice!

2545
03:13:49,010 --> 03:13:51,630
Wall4 just taints your tiny little fragment.

2546
03:13:55,950 --> 03:13:57,470
Worst kept secret.

2547
03:13:57,710 --> 03:13:58,410
That's so funny.

2548
03:13:59,530 --> 03:14:00,210
Anyway, OK.

2549
03:14:00,290 --> 03:14:01,050
Now we can leave.

2550
03:14:01,130 --> 03:14:01,550
For real.

2551
03:14:07,570 --> 03:14:08,670
Subterranean lake.

2552
03:14:14,110 --> 03:14:16,910
I am the combat charge from the heavens.

2553
03:14:17,050 --> 03:14:18,370
Oh, charge from the heavens.

2554
03:14:20,910 --> 03:14:21,870
Charge from the heavens?

2555
03:14:22,410 --> 03:14:24,110
Oh, I don't think I got that weapon, did I?

2556
03:14:25,330 --> 03:14:26,290
Or is it...

2557
03:14:36,930 --> 03:14:38,010
Don't have it yet?

2558
03:14:38,150 --> 03:14:38,310
OK.

2559
03:14:43,420 --> 03:14:44,520
Well, I thought so.

2560
03:14:49,370 --> 03:14:51,210
Oh, I'm scared of falling into the water.

2561
03:14:55,350 --> 03:14:56,650
Or will it?

2562
03:14:57,110 --> 03:14:57,330
OK.

2563
03:15:02,210 --> 03:15:05,650
Large rifle that fires high penetration type bullets?

2564
03:15:09,630 --> 03:15:10,710
Wow, baby!

2565
03:15:15,740 --> 03:15:16,980
Wow, baby!

2566
03:15:18,120 --> 03:15:19,300
Is that my purple weapon?

2567
03:15:34,830 --> 03:15:36,510
Doesn't look very purple.

2568
03:15:36,510 --> 03:15:39,110
Not to you, huh?

2569
03:15:41,710 --> 03:15:44,630
With a little imagination it can be any color.

2570
03:15:48,010 --> 03:15:49,490
Whatever you please.

2571
03:15:49,690 --> 03:15:50,670
What's that song?

2572
03:15:50,850 --> 03:16:02,990
I can be brown, I can be blue, I can be violet skies, I can be pinto, I can be whatever you like.

2573
03:16:07,180 --> 03:16:09,740
Nice rorb stash.

2574
03:16:12,660 --> 03:16:16,180
A little bit of parkour.

2575
03:16:16,180 --> 03:16:16,540
OK.

2576
03:16:17,700 --> 03:16:18,800
OK.

2577
03:16:20,130 --> 03:16:20,680
OK.

2578
03:16:21,740 --> 03:16:22,840
OK.

2579
03:16:24,160 --> 03:16:24,400
OK.

2580
03:16:24,900 --> 03:16:25,220
OK.

2581
03:16:37,770 --> 03:16:40,550
Purple is an emotion.

2582
03:16:42,010 --> 03:16:44,170
What emotion does purple grant you?

2583
03:16:45,330 --> 03:16:46,050
OK.

2584
03:16:46,050 --> 03:16:49,590
I didn't need that, but you know what?

2585
03:16:49,750 --> 03:16:51,290
I just wanted to get it anyway.

2586
03:16:55,880 --> 03:16:56,400
Nice.

2587
03:17:04,490 --> 03:17:05,010
Freaky?

2588
03:17:05,370 --> 03:17:06,430
Makes you want to be freaky?

2589
03:17:07,150 --> 03:17:08,970
This is where we came in from, right?

2590
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:15,820
So do I go through here?

2591
03:17:20,490 --> 03:17:21,410
I guess so.

2592
03:17:21,930 --> 03:17:26,490
I can't figure out how to get to this.

2593
03:17:29,110 --> 03:17:30,700
I don't think we can yet.

2594
03:17:32,950 --> 03:17:33,990
Circle door?

2595
03:17:34,050 --> 03:17:34,270
OK.

2596
03:17:35,810 --> 03:17:36,110
Let's go!

2597
03:17:43,110 --> 03:17:44,430
It's so...

2598
03:17:44,430 --> 03:17:45,490
What am I...

2599
03:18:06,130 --> 03:18:07,150
Holy shit.

2600
03:18:08,010 --> 03:18:08,830
It's crazy.

2601
03:18:12,730 --> 03:18:13,390
Wait.

2602
03:18:14,070 --> 03:18:16,150
OK, I'm back to fighting with my sword now.

2603
03:18:18,710 --> 03:18:19,130
Holy!

2604
03:18:22,250 --> 03:18:23,870
Oh my God, he's so awesome.

2605
03:18:24,670 --> 03:18:25,570
I love this gun.

2606
03:18:29,750 --> 03:18:30,690
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2607
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:35,460
Thank you.

2608
03:18:38,840 --> 03:18:40,180
Oh, with gunslinger?

2609
03:18:40,300 --> 03:18:41,500
Oh my God, you're so right.

2610
03:18:41,760 --> 03:18:43,420
I should have done it with the gunslinger.

2611
03:18:45,820 --> 03:18:47,040
OK, shiny thing.

2612
03:18:47,320 --> 03:18:47,860
Oh boy.

2613
03:18:48,580 --> 03:18:48,920
Oh.

2614
03:18:50,720 --> 03:18:52,120
Should have been me.

2615
03:18:52,580 --> 03:18:53,300
Not him.

2616
03:18:54,360 --> 03:18:55,420
Should have been me!

2617
03:18:56,540 --> 03:18:57,920
Come on spider wife.

2618
03:19:02,940 --> 03:19:03,620
Ambrosia.

2619
03:19:04,180 --> 03:19:06,820
Fruit that mankind is forbidden to even touch.

2620
03:19:07,280 --> 03:19:09,380
It is said to unlock the door to paradise.

2621
03:19:18,230 --> 03:19:19,210
Oh my God.

2622
03:19:29,750 --> 03:19:30,990
Oh jeez.

2623
03:19:33,270 --> 03:19:35,610
Are your little babies gonna come out?

2624
03:19:36,230 --> 03:19:37,490
The babies!

2625
03:19:42,600 --> 03:19:44,960
Can I shoot these things?

2626
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:50,840
OK, not yet I suppose.

2627
03:19:56,680 --> 03:19:58,040
Hello ma'am.

2628
03:20:00,520 --> 03:20:01,400
Three?

2629
03:20:01,780 --> 03:20:02,180
Three?

2630
03:20:02,860 --> 03:20:04,260
What's my lucky day?

2631
03:20:04,260 --> 03:20:05,980
Oh, oh, oh.

2632
03:20:10,570 --> 03:20:11,470
Three or four?

2633
03:20:17,190 --> 03:20:17,670
Owie!

2634
03:20:18,770 --> 03:20:22,690
Oh my God, their teamwork on me is kind of crazy.

2635
03:20:45,340 --> 03:20:46,380
Let go of me!

2636
03:20:47,460 --> 03:20:48,620
Oh my God.

2637
03:20:49,400 --> 03:20:49,840
E

2638
03:20:53,220 --> 03:20:53,420
.T.

2639
03:20:53,580 --> 03:20:54,400
Oh you're so right.

2640
03:20:54,480 --> 03:20:58,040
Sorry, I forgot that I had it since I just got it.

2641
03:21:00,060 --> 03:21:02,100
Thanks for reminding me.

2642
03:21:09,620 --> 03:21:10,800
Yeah, you tried.

2643
03:21:11,860 --> 03:21:12,300
The

2644
03:21:17,320 --> 03:21:18,020
little babies.

2645
03:21:27,760 --> 03:21:28,640
Stupid babies.

2646
03:21:33,030 --> 03:21:33,990
OK, we got everything.

2647
03:21:34,750 --> 03:21:35,810
She forgot she has E.T.

2648
03:21:35,930 --> 03:21:37,430
I just got it, OK?

2649
03:21:37,630 --> 03:21:38,270
To be fair.

2650
03:21:38,750 --> 03:21:40,250
They just gave it to me.

2651
03:22:11,330 --> 03:22:12,470
Wait, I missed a gun?

2652
03:22:12,470 --> 03:22:14,910
No, I got...

2653
03:22:14,910 --> 03:22:17,550
Oh, you mean like I missed one?

2654
03:22:17,650 --> 03:22:19,270
Oh yeah, it's OK, I don't care.

2655
03:22:20,570 --> 03:22:20,850
It's OK.

2656
03:22:22,170 --> 03:22:25,630
Speaking of spider girls, thoughts on Black Arachnia from Beast Wars.

2657
03:22:26,830 --> 03:22:27,970
Oh, I love her, yeah.

2658
03:22:34,110 --> 03:22:38,470
But my favorite Beast Wars is always going to be Megatron.

2659
03:22:39,610 --> 03:22:41,430
Mid-star blasting and it was all over.

2660
03:22:46,290 --> 03:22:48,290
It was Artemis from a while back.

2661
03:22:48,470 --> 03:22:49,970
Oh, it's a laser gun.

2662
03:22:50,090 --> 03:22:50,930
Oh, that would have been cool.

2663
03:22:51,990 --> 03:22:52,890
It's all good though.

2664
03:22:54,090 --> 03:22:55,550
It's all good.

2665
03:22:56,750 --> 03:22:58,930
I'm going to do my little shortcut.

2666
03:23:02,250 --> 03:23:03,750
Oh, that wasn't a shortcut.

2667
03:23:05,190 --> 03:23:05,670
Anyway.

2668
03:23:07,450 --> 03:23:08,410
Anyway, bye bye.

2669
03:23:09,450 --> 03:23:10,150
Bye bye.

2670
03:23:10,150 --> 03:23:14,350
I have a naked... You don't understand.

2671
03:23:15,290 --> 03:23:16,970
It's so much more important.

2672
03:23:17,650 --> 03:23:18,050
Please.

2673
03:23:19,830 --> 03:23:21,250
Please, you don't understand.

2674
03:23:21,370 --> 03:23:22,350
She's waiting for me.

2675
03:23:24,710 --> 03:23:26,450
Use the ambrosia.

2676
03:23:27,530 --> 03:23:28,870
The door to paradise.

2677
03:23:29,430 --> 03:23:31,690
What's in paradise, you guys?

2678
03:23:32,150 --> 03:23:33,790
Sunken opera house.

2679
03:23:35,770 --> 03:23:37,270
Wait, is this the boss?

2680
03:23:40,470 --> 03:23:42,210
Is this the boss, that lady?

2681
03:24:02,700 --> 03:24:03,660
Yeah, it is.

2682
03:24:13,920 --> 03:24:15,620
I already don't want to leave.

2683
03:24:19,640 --> 03:24:21,720
Date, what are you... Date, what are you...

2684
03:24:21,720 --> 03:24:22,300
What?

2685
03:24:22,500 --> 03:24:22,720
No!

2686
03:24:33,770 --> 03:24:35,350
What was this game rated?

2687
03:24:35,790 --> 03:24:36,630
M or T?

2688
03:24:46,410 --> 03:24:48,230
I'm waiting to see what you do.

2689
03:25:00,450 --> 03:25:01,130
Emperor.

2690
03:25:08,880 --> 03:25:11,680
Oh my god, she has so many different attacks.

2691
03:25:12,260 --> 03:25:13,060
Holy cow.

2692
03:25:13,160 --> 03:25:14,800
Oh my god, they all hit hard.

2693
03:25:17,520 --> 03:25:20,940
She has so many attacks.

2694
03:25:38,370 --> 03:25:42,570
Is it... I'm getting... I'm definitely getting... There's blood, so I'm getting something.

2695
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:55,260
But I'm not...

2696
03:25:56,740 --> 03:25:57,680
Oh wait, oh.

2697
03:26:05,620 --> 03:26:07,440
Her health bar is not going down at all.

2698
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:14,960
I was just trying to get rid of... Someone said she has like a force field, but I was trying to get rid of it with a gun.

2699
03:26:17,940 --> 03:26:18,940
Oh shit.

2700
03:26:21,360 --> 03:26:22,360
A backfield.

2701
03:26:32,600 --> 03:26:34,940
Getting close is so dangerous though.

2702
03:26:41,600 --> 03:26:42,300
Oh.

2703
03:26:58,290 --> 03:27:04,600
I don't think I'll get it in this time because my health is so low.

2704
03:27:05,860 --> 03:27:07,040
But, you know.

2705
03:27:08,940 --> 03:27:09,460
We'll see.

2706
03:27:10,820 --> 03:27:12,500
She is tanky.

2707
03:27:13,540 --> 03:27:15,000
She's so tanky.

2708
03:27:26,390 --> 03:27:27,880
Oh, I...

2709
03:27:28,290 --> 03:27:31,210
She talks so much and I can't read her.

2710
03:27:42,450 --> 03:27:44,350
At least I'm getting health back.

2711
03:27:59,190 --> 03:28:00,130
What?

2712
03:28:00,130 --> 03:28:02,830
Oh my god.

2713
03:28:04,750 --> 03:28:06,670
That's so rude.

2714
03:28:06,670 --> 03:28:06,990
That's so rude.

2715
03:28:12,470 --> 03:28:14,930
I just have to get the timing on it.

2716
03:28:15,150 --> 03:28:15,330
Alright,

2717
03:28:28,190 --> 03:28:30,670
so when she says, how's this?

2718
03:28:31,410 --> 03:28:34,510
She does... And then she does get ready.

2719
03:28:34,990 --> 03:28:36,270
She does a little twirl.

2720
03:28:36,590 --> 03:28:38,890
Oh god.

2721
03:28:42,050 --> 03:28:43,410
She sends her bats away.

2722
03:28:57,470 --> 03:28:58,650
Send your bats.

2723
03:29:01,590 --> 03:29:02,670
Get ready.

2724
03:29:03,010 --> 03:29:03,630
Oh my god.

2725
03:29:04,310 --> 03:29:04,890
Shit.

2726
03:29:06,610 --> 03:29:07,810
Oh my god.

2727
03:29:07,990 --> 03:29:08,950
That one she just...

2728
03:29:09,690 --> 03:29:11,070
Okay, send your bats.

2729
03:29:22,470 --> 03:29:23,150
Okay.

2730
03:29:25,590 --> 03:29:26,950
What's she doing now?

2731
03:29:28,450 --> 03:29:29,470
She's laughing.

2732
03:29:29,690 --> 03:29:30,390
She's kind of cute.

2733
03:29:35,130 --> 03:29:36,790
Now she's circling.

2734
03:29:37,950 --> 03:29:38,630
Shit.

2735
03:29:40,170 --> 03:29:42,030
And she's going to shoot bats at me.

2736
03:29:44,470 --> 03:29:44,930
Leave!

2737
03:29:45,050 --> 03:29:45,230
Leave!

2738
03:29:45,330 --> 03:29:45,530
Dante!

2739
03:30:04,910 --> 03:30:06,270
I like that the camera...

2740
03:30:06,890 --> 03:30:07,270
Oh no!

2741
03:30:14,350 --> 03:30:16,270
She's going to send the bats at me.

2742
03:30:22,010 --> 03:30:24,230
That one I... Oh my god.

2743
03:30:24,910 --> 03:30:25,810
What the hell?

2744
03:30:25,910 --> 03:30:26,110
Okay.

2745
03:30:30,590 --> 03:30:32,630
I will become tired.

2746
03:30:34,810 --> 03:30:36,410
I will become tired.

2747
03:30:36,550 --> 03:30:38,670
And then she does a big, big zoom.

2748
03:30:41,090 --> 03:30:41,730
Big...

2749
03:30:41,730 --> 03:30:42,310
Uh oh.

2750
03:30:42,470 --> 03:30:43,590
Okay, I think she's about to...

2751
03:30:47,390 --> 03:30:48,970
What the hell is this?

2752
03:30:53,650 --> 03:30:54,290
Okay.

2753
03:30:56,450 --> 03:30:57,090
Alright.

2754
03:31:17,330 --> 03:31:18,090
Okay.

2755
03:31:20,030 --> 03:31:21,910
Send a lot of bats at me.

2756
03:31:22,810 --> 03:31:24,310
Is she getting taller?

2757
03:31:24,690 --> 03:31:25,670
Or am I crazy?

2758
03:31:27,790 --> 03:31:28,550
Oh

2759
03:31:39,710 --> 03:31:39,950
my god.

2760
03:31:40,030 --> 03:31:42,070
I gotta get some health back.

2761
03:31:42,610 --> 03:31:43,650
Holy moly.

2762
03:31:44,710 --> 03:31:46,190
Become tired.

2763
03:31:58,710 --> 03:31:59,830
Become tired.

2764
03:32:18,550 --> 03:32:20,510
Could you please stop impersonating?

2765
03:32:24,410 --> 03:32:28,590
Dang, we got almost half way.

2766
03:32:29,550 --> 03:32:30,730
We got almost half way.

2767
03:32:37,400 --> 03:32:40,300
Oh, it was her boss name.

2768
03:32:40,420 --> 03:32:41,740
Oh it was the boss, Nevin.

2769
03:32:41,920 --> 03:32:43,000
Oh okay, it's her name.

2770
03:32:47,710 --> 03:32:49,370
Oh if I shoot, I float.

2771
03:32:49,490 --> 03:32:50,150
That is true.

2772
03:32:51,450 --> 03:32:52,290
That is true.

2773
03:32:52,350 --> 03:32:54,490
That will be helpful for when the floor is lava.

2774
03:32:55,870 --> 03:32:58,170
Ah guys, I think I might call it here though.

2775
03:33:00,270 --> 03:33:02,390
Wait, if I stop here...

2776
03:33:04,670 --> 03:33:06,390
If I stop here...

2777
03:33:08,070 --> 03:33:09,730
Do I have to do the whole level again?

2778
03:33:15,930 --> 03:33:16,870
Yeah, I do.

2779
03:33:25,160 --> 03:33:26,140
Just leave it running.

2780
03:33:27,620 --> 03:33:28,000
I could.

2781
03:33:29,220 --> 03:33:30,660
I could just leave it running.

2782
03:33:31,740 --> 03:33:33,460
Do one more try and use Cerberus.

2783
03:33:34,480 --> 03:33:35,540
Okay, okay, okay.

2784
03:33:38,320 --> 03:33:39,920
I'll try Cerberus instead.

2785
03:33:42,700 --> 03:33:43,940
Might as well just finish her.

2786
03:33:44,020 --> 03:33:46,300
Yeah, I don't know how long that will take for me.

2787
03:33:51,100 --> 03:33:52,960
My eyes are starting to...

2788
03:33:52,960 --> 03:33:54,480
Here, you guys watch the cutscene.

2789
03:33:54,480 --> 03:33:55,240
Oh wait.

2790
03:33:56,240 --> 03:33:56,960
What can I do?

2791
03:33:57,040 --> 03:33:57,940
I'm really thirsty.

2792
03:33:58,400 --> 03:33:59,840
So I want to get water.

2793
03:34:00,440 --> 03:34:02,880
Do you think I can get water in the time when the cutscene is going?

2794
03:34:03,300 --> 03:34:04,040
Let's try!

2795
03:34:05,380 --> 03:34:06,300
Okay, you guys watch.

2796
03:34:06,400 --> 03:34:06,800
I'll be right back.

2797
03:34:24,680 --> 03:34:27,880
Now that's what I'm talking about.

2798
03:34:59,630 --> 03:35:00,350
I'm back!

2799
03:35:00,430 --> 03:35:01,970
Oh, I forgot to turn on my mic again.

2800
03:35:03,610 --> 03:35:04,910
But I was like, I'm back!

2801
03:35:08,280 --> 03:35:12,440
I was walking back into my room when I saw her say, then come on sugar.

2802
03:35:12,520 --> 03:35:13,220
And I was like...

2803
03:35:16,380 --> 03:35:17,260
Yeah, baby!

2804
03:35:17,580 --> 03:35:18,980
Hold on, let me take a sippy.

2805
03:35:23,940 --> 03:35:27,740
Actually, I also have to go to the little ghosties room, but I was like...

2806
03:35:30,220 --> 03:35:34,220
Someone also said to refill DT by shooting.

2807
03:35:39,810 --> 03:35:40,870
Oh, it is refilling.

2808
03:35:40,950 --> 03:35:41,430
Look at that.

2809
03:35:41,430 --> 03:35:41,490
What?

2810
03:35:49,170 --> 03:35:51,430
Your bats are kind of...

2811
03:35:53,690 --> 03:35:54,790
It's a bit slow.

2812
03:35:55,170 --> 03:35:58,130
Yeah, but it is an option, I think.

2813
03:35:58,210 --> 03:36:00,170
It is a good, like...

2814
03:36:00,170 --> 03:36:02,110
I think it's a good, like...

2815
03:36:02,110 --> 03:36:03,450
You know, if I just need to...

2816
03:36:03,450 --> 03:36:05,390
If I need to back off for a bit.

2817
03:36:05,510 --> 03:36:07,470
If I'm running low on...

2818
03:36:09,030 --> 03:36:09,790
On HP.

2819
03:36:10,750 --> 03:36:11,790
It could be good.

2820
03:36:16,930 --> 03:36:17,550
Hmm...

2821
03:36:23,720 --> 03:36:24,340
Sugar.

2822
03:36:25,060 --> 03:36:26,980
I miss having Stinger though, honestly.

2823
03:36:29,280 --> 03:36:34,080
Oh, there we go.

2824
03:36:35,220 --> 03:36:37,180
Wait, oh, I thought she was down.

2825
03:36:37,480 --> 03:36:37,880
Nevermind.

2826
03:36:45,890 --> 03:36:46,510
Stop!

2827
03:36:51,420 --> 03:36:52,640
She was down?

2828
03:36:52,760 --> 03:36:53,380
Then what happened?

2829
03:36:55,140 --> 03:36:56,040
What happened then?

2830
03:37:15,690 --> 03:37:16,850
I'm ready.

2831
03:37:22,470 --> 03:37:23,970
I don't think she was down.

2832
03:37:24,230 --> 03:37:25,310
I don't think I was that slow.

2833
03:37:26,490 --> 03:37:27,670
I wasn't that slow.

2834
03:37:31,110 --> 03:37:32,510
Oh well, it's okay.

2835
03:37:33,350 --> 03:37:34,930
We're still trying, baby.

2836
03:37:36,550 --> 03:37:38,690
Oh my god, I'm... Wow.

2837
03:37:39,410 --> 03:37:39,970
Wow.

2838
03:37:42,790 --> 03:37:44,690
Refill, refill, refill, refill.

2839
03:37:47,470 --> 03:37:48,930
What is she doing?

2840
03:37:49,630 --> 03:37:51,790
Oh, I think she's just like...

2841
03:37:51,790 --> 03:37:53,370
Laughing that I'm not doing damage.

2842
03:37:57,450 --> 03:37:58,390
Oh, nice!

2843
03:38:05,800 --> 03:38:07,340
Okay, we're doing good damage though.

2844
03:38:09,700 --> 03:38:10,900
We're doing good damage.

2845
03:38:10,900 --> 03:38:11,080
We're doing good damage.

2846
03:38:27,520 --> 03:38:28,420
Fill up.

2847
03:38:29,180 --> 03:38:30,720
Fill up, fill up, fill up.

2848
03:38:31,520 --> 03:38:32,060
Fill up.

2849
03:38:36,940 --> 03:38:38,320
Oh my god.

2850
03:38:38,740 --> 03:38:40,200
She's like naked down there for real.

2851
03:38:46,320 --> 03:38:47,520
Nice, guys!

2852
03:38:54,640 --> 03:38:56,420
Oh, it's the...

2853
03:38:58,660 --> 03:38:59,220
Okay.

2854
03:39:01,440 --> 03:39:04,200
Now you will become tired.

2855
03:39:04,440 --> 03:39:06,180
Now you will become tired.

2856
03:39:06,620 --> 03:39:07,760
Don't say I won't.

2857
03:39:10,300 --> 03:39:10,700
Now

2858
03:39:17,250 --> 03:39:17,710
you will become tired.

2859
03:39:18,030 --> 03:39:18,790
No, I won't.

2860
03:39:20,170 --> 03:39:21,510
Don't say I won't.

2861
03:39:22,710 --> 03:39:24,570
God, that one does big damage.

2862
03:39:25,230 --> 03:39:26,350
How's this?

2863
03:39:27,370 --> 03:39:28,310
Hammer, please.

2864
03:39:29,110 --> 03:39:31,310
Now you will become tired.

2865
03:39:33,690 --> 03:39:35,250
Don't say I won't.

2866
03:39:36,250 --> 03:39:40,910
I'm getting more DT, guys.

2867
03:39:41,590 --> 03:39:43,430
Alright, and...

2868
03:39:43,430 --> 03:39:44,830
Go in and...

2869
03:39:49,970 --> 03:39:51,370
No.

2870
03:40:01,710 --> 03:40:02,250
No.

2871
03:40:03,310 --> 03:40:04,010
Shoot.

2872
03:40:10,920 --> 03:40:12,740
Big damage!

2873
03:40:14,820 --> 03:40:16,940
Nice, nice, nice.

2874
03:40:23,830 --> 03:40:25,230
Bats.

2875
03:40:28,990 --> 03:40:31,410
I'm so sleepy.

2876
03:40:32,630 --> 03:40:33,970
I'm tired.

2877
03:40:34,110 --> 03:40:34,510
I'm sleepy.

2878
03:40:39,170 --> 03:40:41,270
Become tired.

2879
03:40:44,690 --> 03:40:45,950
No, no, no, no.

2880
03:40:46,250 --> 03:40:46,810
Okay, nice.

2881
03:40:51,490 --> 03:40:52,090
You...

2882
03:40:53,910 --> 03:40:54,510
Nice.

2883
03:40:59,230 --> 03:40:59,970
Damn it.

2884
03:41:00,070 --> 03:41:01,350
I misread it.

2885
03:41:08,180 --> 03:41:08,780
Sugar.

2886
03:41:08,780 --> 03:41:08,900
Sugar.

2887
03:41:19,980 --> 03:41:22,640
And our health is not so bad, so...

2888
03:41:23,500 --> 03:41:23,840
Okay.

2889
03:41:25,360 --> 03:41:25,800
Alright.

2890
03:41:25,980 --> 03:41:26,380
Oh no.

2891
03:41:26,520 --> 03:41:26,920
Phase 2?

2892
03:41:28,840 --> 03:41:29,820
What is this?

2893
03:41:36,720 --> 03:41:37,620
What's happening?

2894
03:41:39,340 --> 03:41:41,600
She's becoming so tall.

2895
03:41:42,060 --> 03:41:43,420
She's become so tall!

2896
03:41:43,420 --> 03:41:43,500
Oh!

2897
03:41:47,330 --> 03:41:48,110
What's happening?

2898
03:41:51,310 --> 03:41:51,870
But

2899
03:41:58,430 --> 03:41:59,730
I was so wrong!

2900
03:42:00,310 --> 03:42:01,050
How dare you!

2901
03:42:13,510 --> 03:42:14,070
Okay.

2902
03:42:20,700 --> 03:42:22,780
Okay, I gotta regain some DT.

2903
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:24,380
I may be able to be easier like this.

2904
03:42:25,640 --> 03:42:27,740
It'll be easier to actually, like...

2905
03:42:29,520 --> 03:42:30,080
Okay.

2906
03:42:31,720 --> 03:42:32,520
Oh shit.

2907
03:42:35,000 --> 03:42:36,580
Oh come on!

2908
03:42:39,720 --> 03:42:40,380
No, no!

2909
03:42:41,200 --> 03:42:42,440
Oh God, you guys.

2910
03:42:42,560 --> 03:42:43,120
Oh God.

2911
03:42:43,860 --> 03:42:45,380
My health, my health, my health.

2912
03:42:46,900 --> 03:42:48,480
My health, my health, my health.

2913
03:42:48,840 --> 03:42:49,100
I

2914
03:43:00,550 --> 03:43:01,550
don't think I have any items.

2915
03:43:02,130 --> 03:43:02,670
I don't think.

2916
03:43:02,690 --> 03:43:03,210
Let me check.

2917
03:43:03,610 --> 03:43:04,630
I don't think I have any though.

2918
03:43:07,590 --> 03:43:07,990
No.

2919
03:43:08,550 --> 03:43:09,190
I have a devil's...

2920
03:43:23,200 --> 03:43:23,760
No.

2921
03:43:23,760 --> 03:43:25,940
This might not be a smart thing, but...

2922
03:43:30,180 --> 03:43:31,220
Oh my God.

2923
03:43:31,620 --> 03:43:33,660
Guys, that was the worst mistake.

2924
03:43:34,260 --> 03:43:34,820
Nevermind.

2925
03:43:35,320 --> 03:43:37,240
That was a horrible, horrible mistake.

2926
03:43:38,620 --> 03:43:40,180
That was a horrible mistake.

2927
03:43:41,300 --> 03:43:42,840
It was a horrible mistake!

2928
03:43:44,160 --> 03:43:44,920
No!

2929
03:44:05,160 --> 03:44:07,040
I'm so upset.

2930
03:44:07,680 --> 03:44:08,760
I'm so upset.

2931
03:44:10,220 --> 03:44:15,700
I'm too afraid to get close to her.

2932
03:44:25,820 --> 03:44:28,280
The kiss of death screwed me over!

2933
03:44:29,420 --> 03:44:31,840
Oh, that kiss of death really...

2934
03:44:31,840 --> 03:44:34,580
Oh, I was doing so well until then!

2935
03:44:34,740 --> 03:44:35,780
How do you avoid that?

2936
03:44:35,820 --> 03:44:38,380
I avoided it the first time, but I think I just like...

2937
03:44:38,380 --> 03:44:40,020
I think I just run away from her.

2938
03:44:42,620 --> 03:44:44,300
Oh, the kiss wasn't worth it.

2939
03:44:49,900 --> 03:44:51,340
Oh, DT breaks out.

2940
03:44:51,460 --> 03:44:52,460
Okay, good to know.

2941
03:44:55,440 --> 03:44:56,240
I'm so...

2942
03:44:57,440 --> 03:44:58,020
Angry!

2943
03:44:59,700 --> 03:45:00,280
Angry.

2944
03:45:07,560 --> 03:45:09,500
I'm just getting my DT, yo.

2945
03:45:16,980 --> 03:45:18,220
Can I button mash?

2946
03:45:18,280 --> 03:45:18,800
I was...

2947
03:45:18,800 --> 03:45:22,780
I was definitely button mashing, but...

2948
03:45:22,780 --> 03:45:23,500
Oh my God.

2949
03:45:23,560 --> 03:45:25,640
I didn't notice that she was sending...

2950
03:45:35,480 --> 03:45:36,780
Taunt gives you DT.

2951
03:45:42,920 --> 03:45:43,740
Is it working?

2952
03:45:45,700 --> 03:45:46,520
Is it working?

2953
03:45:49,120 --> 03:45:50,060
Come on, wimp!

2954
03:45:51,420 --> 03:45:52,460
Oh, it worked!

2955
03:45:52,740 --> 03:45:53,400
Oh my God!

2956
03:46:09,650 --> 03:46:10,430
Oh shit!

2957
03:46:10,910 --> 03:46:11,290
Nice.

2958
03:46:11,510 --> 03:46:12,230
Oh, not nice.

2959
03:46:12,330 --> 03:46:13,050
I got hit.

2960
03:46:41,620 --> 03:46:42,520
What are you doing?

2961
03:46:43,400 --> 03:46:43,920
Run!

2962
03:46:44,760 --> 03:46:45,140
In circles!

2963
03:46:47,960 --> 03:46:48,480
No.

2964
03:46:55,380 --> 03:46:58,060
Wow, DT... It gives a lot of DT.

2965
03:46:58,140 --> 03:46:58,780
That's kind of crazy.

2966
03:47:04,000 --> 03:47:04,520
Oh,

2967
03:47:09,430 --> 03:47:10,170
this is new.

2968
03:47:12,770 --> 03:47:13,750
Oh my God.

2969
03:47:14,050 --> 03:47:14,790
Oh my God.

2970
03:47:15,730 --> 03:47:16,910
That one's new.

2971
03:47:17,350 --> 03:47:17,990
Interesting.

2972
03:47:28,560 --> 03:47:29,200
Damn.

2973
03:47:32,750 --> 03:47:35,670
How did I... How did I...

2974
03:47:35,670 --> 03:47:37,230
You know what?

2975
03:47:37,630 --> 03:47:38,350
That's fine.

2976
03:47:39,490 --> 03:47:40,410
Oh, I jumped!

2977
03:47:40,470 --> 03:47:41,210
I really did!

2978
03:47:41,550 --> 03:47:42,190
I jumped!

2979
03:47:43,330 --> 03:47:46,030
Oh my God, please.

2980
03:47:46,030 --> 03:47:46,210
Please.

2981
03:47:51,620 --> 03:47:53,140
Oh, I was on the stairs.

2982
03:47:53,860 --> 03:47:54,600
That's so funny.

2983
03:48:06,070 --> 03:48:07,050
Oh my God.

2984
03:48:08,110 --> 03:48:09,550
Okay, taunting...

2985
03:48:10,890 --> 03:48:13,830
Taunting only when she's not...

2986
03:48:15,050 --> 03:48:15,330
Go!

2987
03:48:16,770 --> 03:48:17,210
Okay.

2988
03:48:33,750 --> 03:48:35,570
Oh my God, ma'am, please.

2989
03:48:35,690 --> 03:48:36,190
I can...

2990
03:48:38,750 --> 03:48:40,070
Oh, come on!

2991
03:48:47,050 --> 03:48:49,890
No, no!

2992
03:48:52,010 --> 03:48:55,150
I'm not enjoying myself, ma'am.

2993
03:48:56,010 --> 03:48:59,430
Ma'am, I... I'm not enjoying my...

2994
03:49:00,220 --> 03:49:02,250
I'm not enjoying myself, actually.

2995
03:49:09,380 --> 03:49:11,240
Okay, I think it's time for kisses.

2996
03:49:12,380 --> 03:49:13,260
Kisses time.

2997
03:49:25,040 --> 03:49:25,700
Okay.

2998
03:49:27,060 --> 03:49:28,340
I'm trying to... There we go.

2999
03:49:34,090 --> 03:49:34,390
No.

3000
03:49:41,210 --> 03:49:42,310
Come on, wimp.

3001
03:49:43,610 --> 03:49:44,490
Come on, wimp.

3002
03:50:06,790 --> 03:50:08,570
Oh, so the stairs are fine.

3003
03:50:08,630 --> 03:50:09,190
That's so fun.

3004
03:50:14,830 --> 03:50:15,790
Oh my God!

3005
03:50:15,870 --> 03:50:17,830
No, she went the opposite way from what I'm used to.

3006
03:50:20,210 --> 03:50:21,610
She went the opposite way.

3007
03:50:38,070 --> 03:50:39,650
Oh, no, no, no.

3008
03:50:43,250 --> 03:50:44,170
No, no!

3009
03:50:46,090 --> 03:50:48,210
She can't go up the stairs.

3010
03:50:50,800 --> 03:50:52,250
I found your weakness.

3011
03:50:54,810 --> 03:50:56,470
I found your weakness.

3012
03:50:59,270 --> 03:51:00,310
She can't!

3013
03:51:02,210 --> 03:51:02,950
Nevermind.

3014
03:51:03,310 --> 03:51:03,710
Nevermind.

3015
03:51:05,170 --> 03:51:06,390
She can't go up the stairs.

3016
03:51:08,070 --> 03:51:08,870
She tricked me!

3017
03:51:16,220 --> 03:51:17,120
I let go though.

3018
03:51:17,180 --> 03:51:18,320
She can get hurt there.

3019
03:51:37,710 --> 03:51:38,950
Lightning in a bottle.

3020
03:51:49,890 --> 03:51:53,150
I also just realized the volume was up that whole time.

3021
03:51:53,170 --> 03:51:53,950
I'm so sorry, you guys.

3022
03:51:57,130 --> 03:51:57,650
You will.

3023
03:52:01,670 --> 03:52:05,590
You knew my father?

3024
03:52:08,950 --> 03:52:10,450
I got a twin brother too.

3025
03:52:12,990 --> 03:52:15,670
I fill your dark soul with light!

3026
03:52:19,750 --> 03:52:20,450
This

3027
03:52:43,030 --> 03:52:43,950
is insane.

3028
03:52:55,430 --> 03:52:55,990
There is no audience.

3029
03:52:55,990 --> 03:52:58,070
And the best part is he does this for no one.

3030
03:52:58,430 --> 03:52:59,250
Just himself.

3031
03:52:59,590 --> 03:53:00,870
There is no audience.

3032
03:53:04,050 --> 03:53:04,610
Nevan.

3033
03:53:05,090 --> 03:53:08,430
Dante can control bats by jamming in this curious guitar.

3034
03:53:08,430 --> 03:53:08,850
Oh, sorry.

3035
03:53:09,070 --> 03:53:10,490
No, I'm not jamming in.

3036
03:53:10,610 --> 03:53:10,790
Sorry.

3037
03:53:13,170 --> 03:53:15,330
Jamming on this curious guitar.

3038
03:53:15,930 --> 03:53:17,570
It's sickle attack is deadly.

3039
03:53:20,830 --> 03:53:22,570
I'm just...there we go.

3040
03:53:24,830 --> 03:53:26,190
Oh my god!

3041
03:53:27,110 --> 03:53:27,670
Wait.

3042
03:53:43,310 --> 03:53:45,230
There is a door on the other side.

3043
03:53:45,930 --> 03:53:46,570
This is a door?

3044
03:53:50,550 --> 03:53:51,110
Other side.

3045
03:53:55,290 --> 03:53:55,830
I see it.

3046
03:53:59,450 --> 03:54:00,170
Hey lady!

3047
03:54:01,710 --> 03:54:03,010
Are you ready?

3048
03:54:03,430 --> 03:54:04,510
That's a lady.

3049
03:54:11,140 --> 03:54:13,080
I love watching her fight.

3050
03:54:13,760 --> 03:54:16,820
The choreo in this game is like so crazy.

3051
03:54:22,790 --> 03:54:24,470
I must.

3052
03:54:27,390 --> 03:54:28,190
I must.

3053
03:54:31,030 --> 03:54:32,290
Welcome back.

3054
03:54:40,710 --> 03:54:40,910
Not.

3055
03:54:58,500 --> 03:54:59,060
Disbada.

3056
03:54:59,420 --> 03:54:59,980
Disbada!

3057
03:55:00,480 --> 03:55:11,300
Minky, Minky, Minky, Minky...

3058
03:55:11,300 --> 03:55:12,920
Thank you very much.

3059
03:55:14,260 --> 03:55:16,140
Minky gaming, excellent way to end the stream.

3060
03:55:16,420 --> 03:55:17,340
Let's rock!

3061
03:55:19,440 --> 03:55:20,020
Honestly.

3062
03:55:21,700 --> 03:55:22,740
We did it baby.

3063
03:55:23,060 --> 03:55:25,620
Thank you everybody who told me to use Cerberus.

3064
03:55:26,440 --> 03:55:28,780
We kicked her butt after that.

3065
03:55:34,620 --> 03:55:36,540
Ending the stream with a concert.

3066
03:55:37,720 --> 03:55:39,900
Let's save and...

3067
03:55:41,300 --> 03:55:47,420
I guess let's watch the cutscene for the next chapter and then we'll close it out.

3068
03:55:49,580 --> 03:55:54,640
I think we made alright progress today.

3069
03:56:03,080 --> 03:56:08,080
I love leaving with a cutscene and like a cliffhanger you know.

3070
03:56:12,540 --> 03:56:13,820
His own son.

3071
03:56:16,400 --> 03:56:17,800
It must be fate.

3072
03:56:22,240 --> 03:56:22,500
It's fun.

3073
03:56:22,580 --> 03:56:24,980
Every stream we get a new weapon which is pretty cool too.

3074
03:56:25,920 --> 03:56:31,180
Thanks for pushing me to complete this one because I'm glad that we got the new weapon.

3075
03:56:34,880 --> 03:56:35,840
Two new weapons.

3076
03:56:35,960 --> 03:56:37,560
Oh I guess technically yeah, the gun too.

3077
03:56:38,840 --> 03:56:41,360
Why is he so nasally?

3078
03:56:52,240 --> 03:56:54,700
His eyes bulging out.

3079
03:56:57,340 --> 03:56:58,080
Oh!

3080
03:57:05,680 --> 03:57:07,440
He is a baddy baddy.

3081
03:57:09,060 --> 03:57:10,300
That's why she hates devils.

3082
03:57:24,700 --> 03:57:25,380
What about you?

3083
03:57:26,260 --> 03:57:29,080
You're an incomplete being as well.

3084
03:57:31,740 --> 03:57:37,360
Both demon and human blood mingle in your veins.

3085
03:57:38,560 --> 03:57:40,320
Shut up.

3086
03:57:47,600 --> 03:57:53,360
Now that the final door is open, I have no use for you.

3087
03:57:54,700 --> 03:57:55,960
Is that really it?

3088
03:57:58,100 --> 03:57:59,560
He is dead dead?

3089
03:58:01,400 --> 03:58:02,400
That's it?

3090
03:58:05,120 --> 03:58:06,200
Mission 10.

3091
03:58:06,420 --> 03:58:07,220
The job.

3092
03:58:07,480 --> 03:58:08,980
Strengthen the silent bridge.

3093
03:58:11,280 --> 03:58:13,620
He got what he deserved.

3094
03:58:17,870 --> 03:58:20,030
And we never saw him again.

3095
03:58:27,410 --> 03:58:28,890
Oh this stage is boss.

3096
03:58:28,990 --> 03:58:31,750
You guys say that for every stage.

3097
03:58:32,630 --> 03:58:35,290
You guys say that for every stage.

3098
03:58:36,070 --> 03:58:37,170
You didn't have enough motivation?

3099
03:58:39,190 --> 03:58:41,090
Froggy and Phantom together.

3100
03:58:43,530 --> 03:58:45,270
You guys have the same brain.

3101
03:58:47,450 --> 03:58:51,970
Has anyone died in this game from stab wounds?

3102
03:58:52,030 --> 03:58:52,850
That's so true.

3103
03:58:53,450 --> 03:58:54,850
I'm halfway through the game?

3104
03:58:57,130 --> 03:58:57,810
You're right.

3105
03:58:58,590 --> 03:59:00,770
I'm halfway through the game you guys.

3106
03:59:02,130 --> 03:59:02,750
I'm worried.

3107
03:59:02,910 --> 03:59:07,010
I feel like I'm gonna lose everything after I come back from Japan.

3108
03:59:07,130 --> 03:59:10,550
But I'm only gone for a week and a half so I think I'll pick it up.

3109
03:59:11,030 --> 03:59:11,790
I think I'll pick it up.

3110
03:59:11,950 --> 03:59:13,750
Not too bad when I come back.

3111
03:59:14,970 --> 03:59:17,130
But this was so much fun!

3112
03:59:17,130 --> 03:59:24,110
Thank you guys for the fun fun Devil May Cry stories.

3113
03:59:24,530 --> 03:59:26,270
It's just getting crazier and crazier.

3114
03:59:26,570 --> 03:59:28,270
I love these guys.

3115
03:59:29,390 --> 03:59:31,150
I love Dante so much.

3116
03:59:33,290 --> 03:59:35,590
That was fun, wasn't it?

3117
03:59:36,750 --> 03:59:40,890
What a cliffhanger.

3118
03:59:41,230 --> 03:59:41,590
I know.

3119
03:59:42,570 --> 03:59:43,150
Oh no!

3120
03:59:44,250 --> 03:59:45,790
Dante is such a goober.

3121
03:59:45,790 --> 03:59:47,830
He's so great.

3122
03:59:48,170 --> 03:59:50,550
He just does it for... I love this.

3123
03:59:50,630 --> 03:59:53,050
He was just jamming out for the love of it.

3124
03:59:54,250 --> 03:59:59,810
That's truly... We see Dante in his 100% purest form.

3125
04:00:00,150 --> 04:00:01,990
No cameras, no audience.

3126
04:00:02,530 --> 04:00:05,030
I mean there's us, but you know...

3127
04:00:05,030 --> 04:00:07,590
In his mind there's nobody around.

3128
04:00:09,610 --> 04:00:11,170
I love that for him.

3129
04:00:12,610 --> 04:00:13,310
Yumdum!

3130
04:00:13,370 --> 04:00:14,130
Welcome to membership.

3131
04:00:14,250 --> 04:00:15,130
Thank you.

3132
04:00:15,810 --> 04:00:16,930
Virgil is also great.

3133
04:00:17,790 --> 04:00:18,490
He's...

3134
04:00:19,160 --> 04:00:22,690
I like that he's basically the Squidward of the game.

3135
04:00:24,490 --> 04:00:27,310
I have no use for you anymore.

3136
04:00:33,130 --> 04:00:36,290
We are Spongebob and Virgil is Squidward.

3137
04:00:39,170 --> 04:00:41,450
You sounded just like him.

3138
04:00:43,210 --> 04:00:44,590
Where's your motivation?

3139
04:00:44,890 --> 04:00:48,950
I'm gonna start using that anytime something upsets me.

3140
04:00:49,550 --> 04:00:51,510
Where's your... Or I'm challenging something.

3141
04:00:51,990 --> 04:00:53,030
Where's your motivation?

3142
04:00:54,390 --> 04:00:56,230
He's definitely a clarinet player.

3143
04:00:59,230 --> 04:01:01,250
Anyways guys, I really appreciate you watching.

3144
04:01:03,150 --> 04:01:08,130
It took three streams to get to this point, but the first stream was really short.

3145
04:01:08,730 --> 04:01:11,870
So maybe three more streams to finish.

3146
04:01:12,030 --> 04:01:12,350
We'll see.

3147
04:01:13,710 --> 04:01:14,870
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see.

3148
04:01:14,990 --> 04:01:17,450
And then we move on to Devil May Cry 4.

3149
04:01:17,730 --> 04:01:18,370
But we're still halfway.

3150
04:01:21,710 --> 04:01:22,470
We're still halfway.

3151
04:01:23,150 --> 04:01:23,790
Yeah.

3152
04:01:25,170 --> 04:01:26,650
Mint endurance phantom?

3153
04:01:26,970 --> 04:01:27,730
I could.

3154
04:01:28,410 --> 04:01:30,070
I could do an endurance.

3155
04:01:30,790 --> 04:01:32,050
And do two maybe.

3156
04:01:34,350 --> 04:01:36,590
Devil may take six streams.

3157
04:01:41,630 --> 04:01:42,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3158
04:01:44,510 --> 04:01:45,650
Do it in two if you marathon.

3159
04:01:46,530 --> 04:01:48,050
Also depends on my gamer skills.

3160
04:01:49,110 --> 04:01:50,290
I always account for that.

3161
04:01:52,470 --> 04:01:52,950
But yeah.

3162
04:01:55,190 --> 04:01:57,210
DMC may be exhausting to endurance.

3163
04:01:57,850 --> 04:02:00,210
Really depends on how I'm feeling, honestly.

3164
04:02:01,250 --> 04:02:03,250
I think it's with that with any game though.

3165
04:02:03,370 --> 04:02:06,790
Some days I can play a game for seven hours easy peasy.

3166
04:02:06,970 --> 04:02:12,270
And some days I'm like, oh my gosh, I can only touch this game for three hours, two hours, you know.

3167
04:02:13,270 --> 04:02:14,190
It all depends.

3168
04:02:15,070 --> 04:02:16,370
But, felt good today.

3169
04:02:17,110 --> 04:02:18,810
I'm glad we got through so much.

3170
04:02:18,810 --> 04:02:19,770
Yeah.

3171
04:02:21,530 --> 04:02:23,030
Got through two in a jiffy.

3172
04:02:23,470 --> 04:02:25,970
I mean, I wouldn't say a jiffy, but...

3173
04:02:26,790 --> 04:02:28,810
I did just do it in one stream, so...

3174
04:02:31,470 --> 04:02:34,230
Depends on your motivation.

3175
04:02:37,550 --> 04:02:38,510
Otsumito everybody!

3176
04:02:39,050 --> 04:02:43,050
Thank you and I'll see you guys next time for more DMC.

3177
04:02:43,430 --> 04:02:46,630
Or whenever I see you next for another stream.

3178
04:02:46,630 --> 04:02:49,790
I appreciate you guys helping me out again today.

3179
04:02:50,710 --> 04:02:51,430
Thank you guys!

3180
04:02:52,110 --> 04:02:56,770
Merry Christmas Eve!

3181
04:02:58,770 --> 04:03:00,170
Bye bye!

3182
04:03:02,650 --> 04:03:04,050
Otsumito itterasshai!

3183
04:03:04,670 --> 04:03:05,310
Bye bye!

3184
04:03:34,400 --> 04:03:35,960
Guys, I saved, right?

3185
04:03:37,160 --> 04:03:38,420
I did save, right?

3186
04:03:38,780 --> 04:03:39,720
I did save.

3187
04:03:39,940 --> 04:03:40,480
Did I save?

3188
04:03:40,480 --> 04:03:41,540
Did I save the game?

3189
04:03:43,040 --> 04:03:44,120
I'm scared to close out.

3190
04:03:46,260 --> 04:03:46,800
I did?

3191
04:03:48,180 --> 04:03:48,800
I did?

3192
04:03:48,980 --> 04:03:49,240
Okay.

3193
04:03:50,980 --> 04:03:53,240
Because obviously it won't let me save now that I'm in the mission.

3194
04:03:54,260 --> 04:03:55,300
Oh yeah, so I did save.

3195
04:03:56,120 --> 04:03:58,460
It won't let me save now that I'm in the mission.

3196
04:03:58,600 --> 04:03:59,760
Well, I guess I could start the mission.

3197
04:04:00,160 --> 04:04:01,600
And then save in the mission, right?

3198
04:04:11,110 --> 04:04:11,470
Yeah!

3199
04:04:11,750 --> 04:04:12,010
Yeah!

3200
04:04:12,670 --> 04:04:13,730
I'm just gonna save again.

3201
04:04:14,190 --> 04:04:14,890
Just in case.

3202
04:04:15,890 --> 04:04:16,670
Okay.

3203
04:04:18,860 --> 04:04:20,110
Okay, bye!
