00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,280
Hello!

2
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,940
Welcome back, Master and Mistress!

3
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,440
I just realized...

4
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,020
My code for my controller...

5
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,600
is not long enough.

6
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,880
It's okay, I can just sit funny.

7
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,800
It's fine, probably.

8
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,380
Whoopsie-poopsie.

9
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,660
It's not long enough.

10
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,140
Don't forget to breathe during the cutscenes?

11
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,660
I don't need to breathe, I'm dead.

12
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,700
Why?

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,320
What's gonna happen in the cutscenes?

14
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,240
Don't say anything!

15
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,120
No spoilers!

16
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,100
Thank you!

17
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,660
It's my favorite game of all time.

18
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,020
Let's go!

19
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,840
Welcome to Devil May Cry 3!

20
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,260
Before we start...

21
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,620
I just wanna disclaimer.

22
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,720
I think today's stream is gonna be...

23
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,320
much shorter than usual.

24
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,940
Usually I start these streams kind of early in the weekends.

25
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,220
So that I can play lots and lots and lots.

26
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,660
But today I'm just so busy.

27
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,060
So I have a lot to...

28
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,020
I have a lot to take care of before...

29
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,980
next weekend.

30
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,100
Which is the concert!

31
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,860
So...

32
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,060
The new indie game is god damn glorious.

33
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,780
Oh good!

34
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,260
We'll be playing it next week.

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,360
Yeah, yeah.

36
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,320
So busy, busy.

37
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,600
It's a bit busy, busy.

38
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,360
But I will be playing also Devil May Cry next week as well.

39
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,900
Before I leave.

40
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,600
So yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,880
Oh my gosh.

43
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,060
There's so much going on.

44
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,420
Woah!

45
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,000
Just means more DMC3 streams.

46
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,320
Yeah!

47
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,180
So maybe today will be like a little taste.

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,860
You know, like a little sample.

49
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,280
And then we'll get into it more next time.

50
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,000
I hope that's okay.

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,060
Welcome to Devil May Cry 3, Minto.

52
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,740
It's all downhill from here.

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,260
Or uphill.

54
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,780
Depends on who you ask.

55
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,080
Stop!

56
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,340
Are we still on that?

57
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,340
Oh my god.

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,140
Which version of the game, Minto?

59
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,140
Great question!

60
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,280
Actually, it was funny.

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,220
I saw some people in pre-chat.

62
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,240
And they were like...

63
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,900
She's probably, you know, just playing the HD collection.

64
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,760
Because she bought it.

65
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,100
It'd be kind of a waste to buy the...

66
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,280
The Switch version too.

67
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, I got the Switch version.

68
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,120
Oh my gosh.

69
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,920
I don't know why my voice is so...

70
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,280
It's so...

71
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:19,620
Today.

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,200
I got the Switch version.

73
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,380
Because I...

74
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,180
Oh my gosh.

75
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,720
I didn't want to have any issues.

76
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,080
So...

77
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,660
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

78
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,000
Get ready for peak.

79
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,440
So...

80
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,800
If I am correct...

81
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,380
This is...

82
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,840
Oops, sorry.

83
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,560
This is the first game in the timeline.

84
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,360
Right?

85
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,220
Is this...

86
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,560
The first Switch to prep for 5?

87
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,840
Wait, but I bought 5 also on Steam.

88
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,180
Uh-oh.

89
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,080
Yes.

90
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,140
First game.

91
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,900
And chronologically...

92
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,380
So it's 3, 1, 2, 4, 5.

93
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,480
What is this?

94
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,660
Metal Gear...

95
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,240
Actually, this makes it so much easier.

96
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,920
Well, 5 being...

97
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,520
You know.

98
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,980
Exactly like Metal Gear.

99
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,340
But...

100
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,740
5 would be then first.

101
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,640
Ish.

102
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,540
Yeah.

103
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,500
Well, no.

104
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:30,840
Sorry.

105
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,520
No, but it would be a little different.

106
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,560
But it's very similar.

107
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,760
So that makes it easier for me to remember.

108
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,940
Sorry, 5 is the last.

109
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,260
Yeah, 5 is the last.

110
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,320
You know, every second you aren't running, I am getting closer.

111
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,620
Why, Leah?

112
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,160
Why are you so ominous?

113
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,840
Notable DMC releases between 2 and 3.

114
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,780
Dante featured in Shin Megami Sensei.

115
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,340
Sensei?

116
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,600
Tensei.

117
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:01,800
3.

118
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,060
Dante and beautiful Jo1.

119
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,020
And making of DMC2 a manga.

120
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,520
Wait.

121
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,620
Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series.

122
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,240
I'm joking.

123
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,700
Thank you so much for...

124
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,100
Welcome to Devil Mint Cry.

125
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,480
Not a spoiler, but fun fact.

126
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,580
Anything cool you see in cutscenes can be recreated in gameplay.

127
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,120
So get inspired and go for smoking sexy style.

128
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,100
And be sure to have fun.

129
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,820
Also, because I didn't forget.

130
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,480
Gun, sword, gun, trick, gun, sword, royal trick, gun, royal guard.

131
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,070
Gun, sword, gun, trick, gun, royal...

132
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,390
Wait.

133
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,190
Gun, sword, gun, trick, gun, sword, royal trick, gun, royal guard.

134
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:49,790
Got it.

135
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,430
Thank you.

136
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,130
Well, let's get started.

137
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,010
This is my first time.

138
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:53,510
Oh my gosh.

139
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,610
Press X while connected to...

140
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,370
Okay, we're fine.

141
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,570
Thank you.

142
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,130
Even the sound effects are the same.

143
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,770
Can you guys hear it?

144
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,860
Capcom presents.

145
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:13,840
Yeah?

146
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,300
Okay, good.

147
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,240
Wow.

148
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,100
Demon.

149
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,900
Weird lady.

150
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,620
Is that the brothers?

151
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,920
No.

152
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,180
They're twins?

153
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,960
Oh my god.

154
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,360
The brothers.

155
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,140
They're enemies?

156
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,640
No.

157
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,840
What?

158
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,700
Not the brotherly fight.

159
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,640
Why do they look the same?

160
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,920
So they're twins?

161
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,040
Two Raidens.

162
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,060
Oh, my nose is stuff.

163
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,200
They're twins.

164
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,480
I always thought that Virgil had the short hair.

165
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,360
Oh my god.

166
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,520
Oh no.

167
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,800
You didn't finish the job.

168
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,300
Anime hair.

169
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,020
Yeah!

170
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,280
Virgil just slicks his hair back.

171
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,540
Oh my gosh, look at...

172
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:23,760
Why?

173
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,100
Oh my god, look at this guy.

174
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,040
Look at this smirk.

175
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,740
You have Mr. No Nonsense and Mr...

176
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,700
Everything.

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,920
Awesome.

178
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,700
Devil May Cry Dante's Awakening.

179
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,200
Special Edition.

180
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,320
Yeah!

181
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,600
Let's just get into it then, right?

182
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,620
Because...

183
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,720
Tutorial.

184
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,300
Gold or yellow?

185
00:09:59,300 --> 00:09:59,760
Gold?

186
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,920
What is gold or yellow?

187
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,120
Gold is checkpoint system.

188
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,520
Yellow.

189
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,340
Gold is checkpoint system.

190
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,680
Yellow is restart the mission.

191
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,960
No way!

192
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,460
Virgil or Dante?

193
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,540
I don't know.

194
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,840
I've never met either.

195
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,680
I'm sorry.

196
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,980
I've never met Virgil.

197
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,300
Alexander!

198
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Thanks for the pink.

199
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,060
Ok, gold.

200
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,980
Devil May Cry.

201
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,220
Devil May Cry.

202
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,660
You can play with the usual style and weapon changing configuration.

203
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,220
You can freely change styles and weapons.

204
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,160
Wouldn't you want to be able to freely change weapons?

205
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,060
Huh?

206
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,220
Freestyle?

207
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,880
Ok, freestyle.

208
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,080
Everybody is yelling at me freestyle.

209
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:49,460
Ok.

210
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,300
I'm sure I'll have fun regardless what I choose.

211
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,080
Oh, we're watching this again?

212
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,160
Original is not fun.

213
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,680
We have the same intro but with subtitles this time.

214
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,340
Oh, it's Switch exclusive.

215
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,120
I thought it was just that there were port issues.

216
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,300
That's why I got the Switch one.

217
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,000
Got it.

218
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,660
We'll watch it again.

219
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,400
I like the intro.

220
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,720
So edgy.

221
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,260
I met the sons of Sparta.

222
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,860
Yeah, that's gonna be me.

223
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:56,320
The enemies.

224
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,840
It seemed as if they derived some sort of twisted pleasure from this brotherly fighting.

225
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:08,960
So good.

226
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,300
Freestyle is Switch version exclusive.

227
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,580
It's how it plays from DMC4 onward.

228
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,860
Ah, so it's good to learn now, right?

229
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,480
But in the end...

230
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,940
The way he falls is so stiff.

231
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,390
But which one was left standing?

232
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,210
Pizza!

233
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,600
Sir!

234
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,720
Oh my god.

235
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,240
Oh my god.

236
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,760
He doesn't have to use his hands for anything.

237
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,080
Oh my god!

238
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,560
He's styling on everything!

239
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,840
That pizza is gooey.

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,760
My money is on you being a Dante over a Virgil girl.

241
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,180
I'll have to see.

242
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,040
Hi rude.

243
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,260
Where did you hear that?

244
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,240
He saw Raiden.

245
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,420
He sees himself.

246
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,140
He does look like Raiden so much.

247
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,560
Oh the pizza!

248
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,820
The pizza!

249
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,580
Everything twirls and flips in this game.

250
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,240
So great.

251
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,570
Oh!

252
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,370
Thank goodness.

253
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,790
Let a man have a slice!

254
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,910
Yes!

255
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,580
With

256
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,000
a piece of the size...

257
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,940
Nevermind.

258
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,340
Oh no.

259
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,440
No, it's ruining the moment.

260
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,940
Pizza!

261
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,920
Woohoo!

262
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:41,840
Woohoo!

263
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,290
Oh sorry, that's my...

264
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,090
I was like...

265
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,970
Oh that's my switch going into sleep.

266
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,490
So funny.

267
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,900
Oh, but he never misses!

268
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,860
Oh my god!

269
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,500
Oh my god!

270
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,720
Don't bet on it.

271
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,390
I'm sorry, hold on.

272
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,670
I need a moment.

273
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,250
Oh my god!

274
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,390
I need a moment.

275
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,880
That was...

276
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,360
That was incredible!

277
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,960
Oh my god!

278
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,640
Oh my god!

279
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,820
Oh, let's see.

280
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,840
Okay, we have four basic styles.

281
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,700
Use your selected style action and show the enemies just how crazy this party can get!

282
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,680
So we got...

283
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,680
Press A to perform your style attack.

284
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,060
Oh.

285
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,600
Defeat enough enemies and eventually your style will level up, earning you new and wondrous style actions.

286
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,480
Style experience.

287
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,080
You will master a new style action every time your style advances to the next level.

288
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,460
Style experience gauge.

289
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,160
Welcome to DMC3.

290
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,100
Gain experience points by defeating enemies.

291
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,360
Change styles.

292
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,000
Change styles mid-game via the mission start screen or by accessing a divinity statue mid-mission.

293
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,700
Okay, okay, okay.

294
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,920
DMC1 tried so hard to be serious then 3 happened, right?

295
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,860
We're in for a great time.

296
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,560
I'm so excited.

297
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,420
You will begin the game with the trickster style pre-selected.

298
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:00,700
Okay.

299
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,760
Oh, in freestyle mode you can freely change your style during a mission.

300
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,640
So we just go, ooh, trickster.

301
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,740
Ooh, gunslinger.

302
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,640
Ooh, swordmaster.

303
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,780
Ooh, royal guard.

304
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,520
Okay.

305
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,600
Joy-Con dual controller grip and pro controller only.

306
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,260
Okay.

307
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,820
Mission 1.

308
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,040
A crazy party.

309
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,500
Wait, what's custom?

310
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,520
Oh, so customize is like all my stuff, right?

311
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,780
Changing my style.

312
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,200
Okay, so trickster.

313
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,000
Allows players to avoid enemy attacks using special evasive movements.

314
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:40,200
Player can master different melee weapons and maximize each weapon's power with swordmaster.

315
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,520
Player can master different guns.

316
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,540
Okay, that makes sense.

317
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,300
Royal guard minimizing the damage of an enemy attack.

318
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:48,980
Okay.

319
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,640
I guess it said we'll start with trickster, so why not, right?

320
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,820
Equipment, what we got?

321
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,820
Ebony and ivory.

322
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,980
Oh yeah, baby!

323
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,400
And rebellion.

324
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,340
Royal guard has a parry.

325
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,840
Oh no, I'm not good at the parry.

326
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,360
I guess it's time to get good maybe, right?

327
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,460
All right.

328
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,840
Mission start?

329
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,360
Oh, thank you.

330
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,200
Okay, let's see.

331
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:33,260
Lock on, melee attack, style action, shoot, jump, change style, move character.

332
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,520
Oh my gosh, that's the taunt button?

333
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,940
Interesting.

334
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,640
Okay, you hold R and then press L to change target.

335
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,680
Interesting.

336
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,200
Okay.

337
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:47,960
Tuant.

338
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,400
It's a Russian tuant.

339
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,180
Okay, hold on.

340
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,060
I'm gonna have to move over because my controller is too...

341
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,020
My controller cord is too short.

342
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,660
Okay.

343
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,700
Hopefully this works.

344
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,480
Taunt often?

345
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:07,900
Really?

346
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,420
I don't think I taunted that much in 1.

347
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,560
I know that it was a thing.

348
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,360
I'm gonna have to remember that it's a button here and not press the screenshot button.

349
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,600
And that's pause.

350
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,320
Okay.

351
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,500
So let's...

352
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,720
Oh, I got a orb!

353
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,980
So, what am I...

354
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,480
Crazy!

355
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,620
Crazy!

356
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,920
How do I...

357
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,860
Attack time...

358
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,800
Attacks differ depending on the timing of each.

359
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,680
Okay.

360
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,240
Slight pause.

361
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,640
Which one... It's the slight pause that's the...

362
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,620
That's stinger, right?

363
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,000
Press X to admit it.

364
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,740
Fire a gun with Y.

365
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,000
Repeatedly press Y to fire...

366
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,580
Rapidly fire at enemy.

367
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,700
Press Y, okay.

368
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,840
I don't...

369
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,420
My style points are just...

370
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,960
It's a blast!

371
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,400
Come here, baby.

372
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,740
Stylish!

373
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,080
Styling profiling!

374
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,140
Come on!

375
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,420
Stylish!

376
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,920
What the hell is that thing?

377
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,460
Is that it?

378
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,020
Oh, where is he?

379
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Oh, where is he?

380
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,400
Where did he go?

381
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,980
I can't see anything.

382
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:47,800
Come here!

383
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,420
You'll come to me!

384
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,020
Oh!

385
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,760
Where is he?

386
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,520
Oh, there he is!

387
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,300
He's on the floor!

388
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,500
Crazy!

389
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,620
Oh yeah, I should lock...

390
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,300
I forgot to lock on, huh?

391
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:06,740
Oopsie.

392
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,620
Yeah!

393
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,760
Come here, baby.

394
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,560
Oh my god!

395
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,280
I almost got hit.

396
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,520
Yeah, baby.

397
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,970
It's a blast!

398
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:35,910
We're blasting!

399
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,470
Come here.

400
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,010
Yeah, we're alright.

401
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,290
My rorbs!

402
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,980
Come here.

403
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,480
Come here, little rorb.

404
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,820
My rorbs, my rorbs.

405
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,520
Oh, it's dope, baby!

406
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,500
Oh my god, that thing is fast!

407
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,020
Wait, so it's...

408
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,820
Wait, no, hold on.

409
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,380
I did it wrong.

410
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,480
Oh my gosh, stop!

411
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,660
I don't know what I'm doing.

412
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,070
I got a grorb!

413
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,790
Returns last life power.

414
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,450
Let's go.

415
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,630
Come here.

416
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,460
Yeah!

417
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,580
It's craziness!

418
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,300
Anybody else?

419
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,300
Oh, I got Mr. Rorb.

420
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,480
Oh, we got it.

421
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,600
This party is getting...

422
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,020
Oh no, they destroyed our parent.

423
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,490
Does he put on a shirt?

424
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,410
$1 for every mile I ran before stream.

425
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,290
Let's go!

426
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,510
This guy just can't get a pizza.

427
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,050
He looks so angry.

428
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,370
Not our pizza.

429
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,050
Oh!

430
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,210
That was mean!

431
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,390
Yeah!

432
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,990
Pause menu, there is a status screen.

433
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,450
You can go there and select devil arms.

434
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:42,950
And what?

435
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,950
Devil arms.

436
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,770
You can check all the weapons combo.

437
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,190
Oh, I see.

438
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,060
Time D.

439
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,480
Sorry, it just started the game.

440
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,360
My god.

441
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,360
Why are you saying D?

442
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,540
Oh, dab!

443
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,440
Dab!

444
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,200
I got a B.

445
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,680
Mission 2, the blood link.

446
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,360
How many missions are in this game?

447
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:19,900
I'm curious.

448
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,820
Oh my gosh, how much...

449
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,360
I didn't get...

450
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,520
How many Rorbs did I buy?

451
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,440
Wait.

452
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,100
Where did I get?

453
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:30,920
Two?

454
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,360
I almost have 3,000 Rorbs!

455
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,290
I almost have 3,000 Rorbs, you guys.

456
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,010
It's kind of insane.

457
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,150
Give me the plorb, please.

458
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:47,950
Buy actions.

459
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,290
Yeah, honestly.

460
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,130
Stinger!

461
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,950
Ok, I bought Stinger.

462
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,330
My beloved.

463
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:57,450
7?

464
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,420
What is...

465
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,800
How are we getting customers?

466
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,940
It's literally the end of the world.

467
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,900
Oh god, he's seething.

468
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,160
You're gonna pay for that.

469
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,260
Oh, bless you.

470
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,900
See, this is why you don't go around shirtless.

471
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,480
These guys sure are patient.

472
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,680
They're just letting him stand there.

473
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:59,140
I think we have bigger issues.

474
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,840
What are you...

475
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,640
So he's selling his services, right?

476
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,200
Special moves.

477
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,900
Now, ain't I special?

478
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,820
Input certain commands to execute powerful special moves.

479
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,440
Hold R and press X while holding L back.

480
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,060
Hold X and your character will rise into the air as well.

481
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:21,940
Wait, really?

482
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,740
Holding...

483
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,720
I'm taunting.

484
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,690
Oh, shoot.

485
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,890
What is that?

486
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,470
Oh, nice.

487
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,010
I got a Milestone.

488
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,430
Additional spam, welcome to Mambo Champ.

489
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,090
Thank you.

490
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,240
Nice.

491
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,940
Oh, we almost had a crazy combo there.

492
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,200
Crazy!

493
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,820
Blast off.

494
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,160
Oh, where am I?

495
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,870
I wanna taunt them a little bit.

496
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,210
Come here.

497
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,010
Oh, okay, we're going to this guy.

498
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,410
Hey, come here.

499
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:39,930
Come back.

500
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,400
Oh, shit.

501
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,850
Oh, what the heck is that?

502
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:05,830
Oh, that's nasty.

503
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,510
Is that thing gonna explode?

504
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,530
Is this...

505
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,630
Definitely evade the enemy's side roll.

506
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,670
Yeah, I was doing that.

507
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,950
I was doing that.

508
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,710
Hold R, press B.

509
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,510
Oh, jump back.

510
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,730
Okay, okay, okay.

511
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,450
Okay, okay, okay.

512
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,550
Definitely

513
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,420
didn't...

514
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,220
Blast off!

515
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,580
Blast off!

516
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,740
Blast off!

517
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,780
Blast off!

518
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,800
Wait, now how do I go into the air?

519
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
It said that if I hold down X...

520
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,600
Oh, no, no, no!

521
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,620
This thing is nasty!

522
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,760
Oh, my god.

523
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,520
Oh, it's dead.

524
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,880
I don't like this.

525
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,000
Blast off!

526
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,100
Blast off!

527
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,140
Oh, my gosh.

528
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,140
Hey!

529
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,240
Oh, nice!

530
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,260
Nice.

531
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,400
Blast off!

532
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,800
Blast off!

533
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,320
Blast off!

534
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,100
Oh, I got it.

535
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,100
Blast off!

536
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,620
Blast off!

537
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,310
Oh, no.

538
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,430
It's these things.

539
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:40,530
Oh, gross.

540
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,930
Oh, it's these things.

541
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,070
Oh, it's these guys.

542
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,370
Oh, it's these guys.

543
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:48,790
Nice.

544
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,790
Am I parrying or...

545
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,650
What's going...

546
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,380
Where's my health?

547
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,880
I haven't even been paying attention.

548
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,660
Oh, I have to start over at the very beginning!

549
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,480
Oh, it's up there.

550
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:22,880
I see it.

551
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,260
I see it.

552
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,690
We're getting used to it.

553
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,230
Okay.

554
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,810
Okay, it's just these guys.

555
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,670
I think getting exploded earlier did a number, maybe.

556
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:55,360
I missed that combo.

557
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,760
It didn't help, yeah.

558
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,930
No one to blast off.

559
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,860
I tried to dodge.

560
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,280
But I did the wrong thing.

561
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,960
I did the trick thing instead of the...

562
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,100
Oh my god.

563
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,500
Break!

564
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,040
There we go.

565
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,320
And avoid!

566
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:41,820
Avoid!

567
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:42,880
Nice.

568
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,380
Nice, we got healed.

569
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,720
And then we lock on and we shoot!

570
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,340
Nice.

571
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:50,480
Nice.

572
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,100
Don't listen to that guy.

573
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,740
We ignore him.

574
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,680
We don't care about him.

575
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,460
And I switch...

576
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,480
Did he already explode?

577
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,540
Is he gone now?

578
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:12,500
Avoid!

579
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:12,740
Avoid!

580
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:12,960
Avoid!

581
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,130
Oh, he's gone?

582
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:17,590
Okay, cool.

583
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,010
Hey!

584
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,470
Hey!

585
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Hey!

586
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:30,360
Hey!

587
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:30,460
Hey!

588
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,110
Okay.

589
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,170
Use the D-pad to switch styles.

590
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,430
Sword master is good for more damage.

591
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:51,010
I like how people are like, D-pad please, as if I haven't just started playing this game for the first time just now.

592
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,370
Gosh, Vtuber, how have you not already mastered the controls?

593
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,030
This is craziness.

594
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,470
Vtuber...

595
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,230
Oh, this is considered a boss?

596
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,810
Or did they...

597
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,990
How do I... Wait.

598
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,050
How do I switch?

599
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:14,790
Oh, there we go.

600
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,070
I'm gonna do this.

601
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,650
Oh my god.

602
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,620
Oh, I'm gonna die.

603
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,000
Oh shit, I'm gonna die you guys.

604
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,900
I'm gonna die!

605
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,760
I don't wanna do it all over again, please!

606
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,240
Do I have items?

607
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,160
Actually, I don't know if I do.

608
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,060
DMC2 style isn't gonna work here.

609
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,140
Yeah, but like...

610
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,580
I don't wanna get close to that guy.

611
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,640
Do I have any items?

612
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,420
Oh, I do have a vital... Oh, I picked up that vital star.

613
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,000
That's right.

614
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,460
Okay.

615
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,140
That's okay.

616
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,900
The more I do it, the better I'll get at the game.

617
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,990
Blast off!

618
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:39,920
Oh, come here.

619
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:51,190
The first move is mine, baby!

620
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,780
I wanna not be...

621
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,330
Nice.

622
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:04,930
Yeah!

623
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,990
Oh, dang it.

624
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,390
Why did you have to go so far away?

625
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,030
No!

626
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,150
Oh, good thing.

627
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,350
Oh gosh, these guys are so fast.

628
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,580
Oh, still?

629
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,160
How are you still alive?

630
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,900
Oh, I'm still a gunslinger!

631
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,620
Why?

632
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,080
How do I... Oh, there we go.

633
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:40,660
Sword Master.

634
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,500
Okay.

635
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,820
Oh, creepy.

636
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,100
No, please.

637
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:09,720
Please.

638
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,500
I'm gonna curl myself.

639
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:19,680
No!

640
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:25,020
Oh, I tried to dodge, but I was so excited about...

641
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,640
I'll definitely have to use my vital star.

642
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,960
Oh my gosh, she's still alive.

643
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,490
Jumping creates iframes.

644
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,130
Oh, really?

645
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,670
That's kind of crazy.

646
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,890
I hate this thing so much.

647
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,880
I parried though.

648
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,060
No, no!

649
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,940
I'm trying to dodge, but I'm bad at it.

650
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,380
This is such a great tutorial, isn't it?

651
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,520
No!

652
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,300
Wait, I'm gonna change... I'm gonna take my...

653
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,960
Oh my god, I pressed B instead.

654
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,380
That was craziness.

655
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,330
Oh my god.

656
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,370
I'm so bad at...

657
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:04,650
God.

658
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,970
Oh, please, please, please, please, please.

659
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,850
Please, please.

660
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,130
No!

661
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,070
Please, god, no!

662
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,450
I hate this.

663
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,530
I hate this already.

664
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,500
I've already...

665
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,610
Guys, I... What the fuck?

666
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,210
What the fuck?

667
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,580
It's a badge of honor.

668
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,100
Oh my god.

669
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,960
Three is more difficult?

670
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,800
You could've warned me!

671
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,720
Oh my god.

672
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,140
The whole stream is gonna be this fucking area!

673
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,420
Sorry.

674
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,240
Sorry for so much cursing today.

675
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,540
I'm just a little...

676
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,100
Because I got so much going on.

677
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,180
I'm just like...

678
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,380
Please.

679
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,220
Dante, I need you to dodge.

680
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,860
Does he not... Does he not, like, do his little... Oh, he does do his dodge roll.

681
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,250
It's just because it's... Okay, it's left or right.

682
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,020
Maybe I should... Dodge, dodge, dodge.

683
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,340
Dodge.

684
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:58,700
Dodge.

685
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,680
Dodge, dodge.

686
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,410
What's this guy?

687
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,880
Oh, I forgot he's back again.

688
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:38,840
Yeah.

689
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,320
No hit run over Sag.

690
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:13,800
Oh no.

691
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:14,700
Oh well.

692
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,180
It's okay.

693
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,060
Dodge.

694
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,020
Dodge.

695
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,220
Suddenly...

696
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,300
Fuck.

697
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,220
I'm trying to dodge, but... I think I'm...

698
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,780
I'm trying... I'm a little... I'm not timing it correctly.

699
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,060
Oh shit.

700
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,140
Maybe I do need easy mode.

701
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,220
Oh my god.

702
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,100
Use trickster style for better dodging?

703
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,000
I think I...

704
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,440
My vital star is gone.

705
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,120
My vital star is gone.

706
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,230
Look how much...

707
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,250
Rorbs I have though.

708
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,030
We're farming the rorbs for real.

709
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,770
No way.

710
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,350
There's no way I can do this.

711
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,580
Oh my god.

712
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,840
Oh god, I'm scared.

713
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,940
Wait, I need the trickster.

714
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:46,700
Tricks.

715
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,260
Trick.

716
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:47,680
Trick.

717
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:47,860
Trick.

718
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,180
I'm just gonna keep.

719
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:52,840
I'm just gonna keep.

720
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:53,680
I'm just gonna keep.

721
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,560
I'm just gonna go.

722
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:07,320
And dodge and hit and dodge and hit and dodge and hit and dodge and hit and dodge and hit and dodge and hit and dodge and hit and dodge and hit and dodge and hit and dodge and hit and dodge and hit and dodge and hit and dodge and hit.

723
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:10,740
Maybe it's working!

724
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,500
Maybe it's working!

725
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,300
Maybe it's working!

726
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:12,980
Maybe it's working!

727
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,420
Please!

728
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:13,820
Ah!

729
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,360
Oh my god!

730
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,460
Oh my

731
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,040
god!

732
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,700
I like, got so excited I punched my desk.

733
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,460
Hold on...

734
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,600
I need...

735
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,640
I'm gonna need a band-aid after.

736
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,180
I'm ectoplasming.

737
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:57,990
Wowee.

738
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,150
Where does the time go?

739
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,110
You think he heard that?

740
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,850
I think he needed to yell that, Dante.

741
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,430
Oh my god, Virgil.

742
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,800
The brothers.

743
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,740
The brothers!

744
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,580
I'm already so uncomfortable.

745
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,500
So basically, I'm like...

746
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,640
Having to... I'm like...

747
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:41,520
My... Since like the cord of my controller is not long enough, I'm like having to twist my body...

748
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,520
To play this.

749
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,620
Yeah!

750
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,380
Oh.

751
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,900
A whale.

752
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,350
Nice dodge and hit, thank you.

753
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,170
Is this someone's birthday?

754
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:02,970
Holy Tama, is it your birthday?

755
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,910
Happy birthday to you.

756
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,990
Happy birthday to you.

757
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,050
Happy birthday, holy Tama.

758
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:17,770
Happy birthday to you.

759
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,010
Happy birthday!

760
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,330
Dodge and hit, dodge and hit, dodge and hit.

761
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,870
It worked, baby.

762
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:28,370
It worked.

763
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:30,550
Oh, gosh.

764
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,710
I didn't realize this game was gonna be... Wait, so...

765
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,850
Can you... Question.

766
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:37,530
Can I switch modes at any time?

767
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,810
If I'm on normal now and I'm just like... You know what, guys?

768
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,270
I need easy mode.

769
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,370
Wait, why is it half yes, half no?

770
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,850
It starts you over.

771
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,970
You have to restart the game.

772
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,210
You trusted your instincts as a gamer.

773
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,220
People saying yes are wrong.

774
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,080
So I just have to really...

775
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,780
Oh my god.

776
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,400
Okay then, guys.

777
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,860
This might be...

778
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,940
A bit longer of a playthrough than...

779
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,400
Than we realize.

780
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,160
But...

781
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:43,690
I might have just screwed myself over, but...

782
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:44,510
Time to...

783
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,430
Time to become a gamer.

784
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:47,450
Never.

785
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,130
Oh my gosh.

786
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:52,650
Oh no.

787
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:53,690
I'm scared.

788
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,170
Who is this freak?

789
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,470
Volgin.

790
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:11,610
The Great One.

791
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,810
I wish the voices weren't so quiet in these games.

792
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:43,990
The necklace.

793
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:52,270
But he has no idea of its true power.

794
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,930
Why do they hate each other, brothers?

795
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,870
Oh, screw this guy.

796
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,550
I don't want to see you ever again.

797
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,210
I know I will, but you know.

798
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,630
Yeah, you're annoying me.

799
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,200
Get sliced cheese.

800
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,860
He just looked in shock like...

801
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,420
Come on, man.

802
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,340
For Virgil, it only took him two slices.

803
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,120
And for me, it took me two lives.

804
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,020
Female.

805
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,320
Lady.

806
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:43,460
Lady.

807
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,740
Is that actually a lady?

808
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,820
I don't know anything about her.

809
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,560
I just know her name.

810
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:05,720
Three.

811
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,800
Why are you guys saying three?

812
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,480
I mean, yeah, we're on mission three, but...

813
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,980
Now we have lots of money.

814
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,620
So let's...

815
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,340
How much is...

816
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,580
10,000!

817
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,420
These games.

818
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,640
Maybe I need some blorbs.

819
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,340
I can't get the blorbs yet, so...

820
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,120
Number of the mission appears in the cutscenes.

821
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,060
Really?

822
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,760
There is a hidden number in the cutscenes?

823
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:45,880
Okay.

824
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,260
It's fine.

825
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,260
I don't have Devil Trigger yet.

826
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,420
Okay, I am gonna buy a blorb, though.

827
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,320
Give me one extra thing.

828
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,380
Okay, 2,000.

829
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,320
Now we went up to 10,000!

830
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,260
These games are...

831
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,300
Okay.

832
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,280
Virgil's VA...

833
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,680
Played the Quantum Ranger in Power Rangers Time Force.

834
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,660
He's used to this.

835
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,740
Dead enemies on fire form to three when they fell on the ground.

836
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,140
No, no, no.

837
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,060
I'm good over there.

838
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:36,840
I don't need to go back.

839
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,320
Oh, these guys look not so great.

840
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,420
Kick jump?

841
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,140
Jump two times as high as normal by pushing off certain surfaces.

842
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,520
After jumping, while touching a wall, press B again.

843
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,500
Oh, okay.

844
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:04,760
Well...

845
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,180
I wish I could run faster.

846
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,980
Oh my god, there's you guys too?

847
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,760
Oh, please.

848
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,980
Why am I not... Oh, I'm locked on to, I think, this guy up here.

849
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,000
Oh, please.

850
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:20,960
Stop!

851
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,000
Never mind.

852
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,840
What?

853
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,210
There are two types of seals.

854
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,990
Oh, so blue is solving the puzzle.

855
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,510
Red is defeat the enemy.

856
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:37,350
Got it.

857
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:38,490
This was a blue.

858
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:45,650
Boss is so... The game is so easy, everybody.

859
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,310
Nice.

860
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,030
Game is so easy.

861
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:50,190
Oh, breakables.

862
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:51,270
Yep, I knew that.

863
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,290
I can break everything.

864
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:54,850
Oh, I can break everything.

865
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:57,750
Wow, I can break everything.

866
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,860
Today's menu.

867
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,160
Don't even think about it.

868
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,710
Easy puzzle, everybody.

869
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,490
Easy puzzle.

870
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,970
What else can I break?

871
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,330
I thought I would be able to leave there.

872
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:32,150
Why are there so many cows in here?

873
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,440
Good service, indeed.

874
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:39,880
Yeah!

875
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,460
Get the bottles.

876
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,240
I'm doing it.

877
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,260
There we go.

878
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:49,280
Oh, one more?

879
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,200
There we go.

880
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,100
Get the shotgun.

881
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,160
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

882
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:06,700
I am usually okay with backseating to an extent, but if I'm just walking around and I'm exploring and I'm cutting things up, I don't need you guys to rush me today, okay?

883
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:13,240
I don't need you guys to be like, hey, Minto, chop chop, get to the next thing, come on.

884
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:13,820
Alright?

885
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,440
Not today at least, please.

886
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,380
Cut me some slack today, if anything, please.

887
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,800
There we go.

888
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:25,720
Shotgun.

889
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:34,220
In freestyle mode, you can freely change guns by using R while pressing ZL.

890
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,080
Okay.

891
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:39,300
Press ZL to accelerate guns in a clockwise fashion.

892
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,780
ZL.

893
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,880
Oh, and then R.

894
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:45,600
Okay.

895
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:53,600
We'll probably want to keep, since we're not, not as like DMC2.

896
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:02,540
Maybe then we, we, then would want the shotgun.

897
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,980
Because I feel like in DMC2 it was like, you use the guns for speed, because it's like pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

898
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:12,840
Bullseye.

899
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,560
Love planet?

900
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:32,630
I thought this was a bar.

901
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,790
It's a secret bar.

902
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,110
Oh, camera.

903
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,010
Control the camera with R.

904
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,370
Oh, you can?

905
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:40,470
Oh my God.

906
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,890
Oh my gosh, I can finally control the camera.

907
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:46,050
Oh no.

908
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:47,970
Oh no!

909
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:50,610
They're like, hey, you want out of here, buddy?

910
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,630
Stylish rank.

911
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:57,970
You won't gain points by merely repeating the same move over and over.

912
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:58,970
Okay, my bad.

913
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:00,170
I'm trying.

914
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,090
I'm doing my best.

915
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,210
Use the pole.

916
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:04,710
Can I?

917
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:16,490
No way!

918
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,730
Oh my goodness, where did that guy come from?

919
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,510
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

920
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,530
And dodge.

921
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:40,850
Oh, dodge, dodge, dodge.

922
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,580
Wait, how do I use it again?

923
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,900
How do I use it again?

924
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,280
Destroy the tables!

925
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,520
Watch out, Dante.

926
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,230
I'm attacking through.

927
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:13,750
Watch out, watch out.

928
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:19,410
I gotta... Oh my God, switching guys is kind of annoying.

929
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,870
With pressing it, you know?

930
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,150
Come here.

931
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:35,970
Wait, let me use it.

932
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,410
I've never been on a pole before.

933
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:50,400
Okay!

934
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,380
Yay!

935
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,000
My friend, she was though like...

936
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,300
She was like, maybe we should try, you know how like, the pole dancing lessons?

937
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,640
How like, it's really good for your core, right?

938
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,720
She was like, maybe we should do some lessons.

939
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,100
Mint, use the stripper pole as God intended.

940
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,720
Spain.

941
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:20,860
Spain!

942
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,080
Dante doesn't need lessons.

943
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,280
Nah, he is a natural.

944
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,540
I think we got it.

945
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:28,740
Oh.

946
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,580
I didn't completely destroy everything in this room.

947
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,100
This place looks so...

948
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,460
Gross.

949
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,840
Even before it was a strip club, or...

950
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,820
Yeah, even before it got destroyed.

951
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,800
Like, look how grungy it is in here.

952
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,560
How do I do it again?

953
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,700
This game is a lot more balanced and is one of the best in the series.

954
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,280
Take all the time you want and enjoy it.

955
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,160
Strongest goal is made.

956
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,020
Thanks!

957
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:06,120
Thanks!

958
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,000
It was this door, right?

959
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:26,360
Oh.

960
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,320
This doesn't look so great.

961
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,160
Was it this door?

962
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,540
3D debut idea.

963
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,260
My brother...

964
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,040
Is up there.

965
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,460
Oh, there are so many robes.

966
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,860
Oh, so you can either go through the bullseye entrance or you can go through the nightclub entrance.

967
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:52,720
Got it.

968
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,260
Wait, how do I...

969
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:02,580
Nice.

970
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,820
Gather items.

971
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,520
What the heck?

972
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,540
What is this?

973
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,880
Oh, it's a roar machine.

974
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,940
The giver of roars.

975
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,260
Virtual and narrow SVAs.

976
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,580
Oh, both played Power Rangers.

977
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,120
Seriously?

978
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,050
English or Japanese?

979
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:30,290
Wait.

980
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,090
Destroy this.

981
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,050
Nice.

982
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,390
Why is it giving me so much stuff?

983
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:39,910
I'm nervous.

984
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,570
It's never a good sign.

985
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:44,990
What the hell is this?

986
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:52,170
English version.

987
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:11,970
Oh no, I'm trying to...

988
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:16,510
Oh.

989
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:21,790
I guess I'm good at this game.

990
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:26,990
I guess I'm good at this game, you guys.

991
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:33,070
Statue of Omniscient...

992
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:35,650
Of the Omniscient God of Time and Space.

993
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,070
Wait, it's a lion this time.

994
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:42,810
By offering a demon blood, one can attain the power of the ancient magic clans.

995
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,010
Anyway.

996
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:51,830
We have 11,000 now.

997
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,530
We can...

998
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:56,770
We can get our stinger up.

999
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:59,810
What is drive?

1000
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:01,490
Are all of these...

1001
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,240
20...20...20...

1002
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,700
20,000!

1003
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1004
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:17,380
Sorry.

1005
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,040
Save for air hike.

1006
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,460
20k is pretty easy to get, isn't it?

1007
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,920
Okay, we'll keep going.

1008
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,440
The music is so dramatic.

1009
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,640
Ice Guardian's Chamber.

1010
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,100
Oh, I don't like that.

1011
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:43,720
Oh,

1012
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,810
it said style, but I thought it said save.

1013
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:52,990
Can I save?

1014
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:54,330
Save.

1015
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:13,260
Servers.

1016
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,380
Oh my god, I need to scoot over more.

1017
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,080
Sorry, my back is hurt.

1018
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,140
I have to twist this entire time.

1019
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,840
Maybe my controller is charged by now.

1020
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:30,870
Oh nice.

1021
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,250
Nice doggy.

1022
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:34,850
Nice doggy.

1023
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:36,830
Nice boy.

1024
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:37,470
Good boy.

1025
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:42,350
It's bow-bow time, Mother Fluffer.

1026
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,130
Wow.

1027
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,470
Oh my god, he is so sassy.

1028
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:07,490
I missed you Dante.

1029
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:09,610
I missed you.

1030
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:15,830
Oh my god, he's got so many lines.

1031
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:21,650
We missed you.

1032
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:23,970
Oh yeah.

1033
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:24,870
Oh yeah.

1034
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:25,630
Yeah.

1035
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:26,750
Yeah.

1036
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,090
I'm not ready, Dante.

1037
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,150
Oh god, I'm scared actually.

1038
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:35,750
Oh my god, the music though.

1039
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,040
Wait.

1040
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:44,770
Oh my gosh.

1041
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:45,550
Oh my gosh.

1042
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,480
Even with that, it's not doing much.

1043
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,140
Oh, he's gotta thaw out.

1044
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,360
So I just gotta avoid until he thaws maybe?

1045
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,540
Oh, he switched heads.

1046
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,360
Ok, nice.

1047
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:05,960
Oh my god.

1048
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,100
Oh, no.

1049
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,280
I have to break them out.

1050
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:13,920
Ok, just kidding.

1051
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:14,860
I'm stupid.

1052
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:23,690
Oh gosh.

1053
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:42,840
They were doing something.

1054
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:48,150
Oh shoot.

1055
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,120
Jump, jump, jump, jump.

1056
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,080
Oh, I can get his leggies too and everything.

1057
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,140
Ok, interesting.

1058
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:08,420
Ok.

1059
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,280
Ouch, ok.

1060
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:19,830
Aha!

1061
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:21,910
Hits me every time.

1062
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:30,460
I don't feel like I'm doing much, but...

1063
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,200
We're little bit by little bit, it seems.

1064
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,460
Oh, nice.

1065
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,080
Ok.

1066
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,400
Ok.

1067
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:40,520
Ok.

1068
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:42,960
Ok.

1069
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:49,770
Maybe I should have gotten...

1070
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:59,750
Ok, so when he does that...

1071
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:06,960
Oh my god.

1072
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,680
Oh, what's happening?

1073
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:10,660
What's happening?

1074
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:11,780
Oh no, he's free!

1075
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:14,700
Oh my god, he's free and he's solid again!

1076
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:15,520
No!

1077
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,600
I wish I could run faster sometimes!

1078
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:37,790
Oh god.

1079
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,070
Freezy, freezy.

1080
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,820
Oh gosh.

1081
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,920
Wow, one HP in a dream?

1082
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:08,780
For real?

1083
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,580
I don't have anything, do I?

1084
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,960
I don't have any items, I don't think.

1085
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:14,880
Yeah, I have nothing.

1086
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,760
Honestly, you're doing pretty well.

1087
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,420
Oh, thank you.

1088
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:24,280
There's no rorbs around here or anything, are there?

1089
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,100
I mean, not rorbs.

1090
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:26,780
Grorbs!

1091
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:27,600
Nothing!

1092
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,400
Game hates me!

1093
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,660
Oh, sheesh!

1094
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:31,660
Nothing!

1095
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:33,860
No grorbs at all!

1096
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:38,110
No!

1097
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:39,430
Ok.

1098
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,240
I'm a grorb buyer.

1099
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,540
Oh, no, not style.

1100
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:52,820
Sorry.

1101
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:53,180
Wait!

1102
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:59,560
So I'm level 1 trickster still, but how do I get to level 2?

1103
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,280
How hard is it?

1104
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,120
Oh, not equipment.

1105
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:02,460
Sorry.

1106
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,360
Vital star.

1107
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:08,460
Wait!

1108
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:14,290
Oh yeah, we were saving up for the other thing.

1109
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:17,890
Leveling takes a bit.

1110
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,350
Swordmaster mid-air is the way to go if you want to make air combos.

1111
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:25,890
I see.

1112
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:29,750
Let's grab...

1113
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:31,350
Too small?

1114
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:33,930
They go up in price!

1115
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,410
This is so mean!

1116
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:36,790
Game!

1117
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:38,010
This is so mean.

1118
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:39,130
Stop it.

1119
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:40,090
Are you kidding me?

1120
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:47,370
I know it does in every game, but come on!

1121
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,030
This is so mean!

1122
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:53,890
Oh!

1123
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:58,630
It's not worth it.

1124
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:04,270
They try to... They really encourage you to not buy things.

1125
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:06,870
Because they're like, I mean, it's just gonna get more expensive.

1126
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:08,830
Shit.

1127
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,300
Alright, I'll just buy one then and hope and dream.

1128
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:21,040
I'll buy one and I'll hope and I'll dream!

1129
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,410
Wait, so I'm on Trickster.

1130
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:34,550
Swordmaster.

1131
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:41,940
What?

1132
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,120
Oh my god.

1133
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,640
Oh shoot.

1134
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,440
Not doing any damage.

1135
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:58,160
But I'm like not able to dodge very...

1136
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,130
What are you doing?

1137
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:05,770
He's doing his... Nice.

1138
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,420
That did big damage.

1139
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:16,680
That did big damage.

1140
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:17,780
To me.

1141
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:18,880
Not to them.

1142
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,300
Am I supposed to get your feet?

1143
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:31,520
I don't want you to be unchained, you know?

1144
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:35,740
I wish I had Air Hike right now.

1145
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:38,780
Oh no.

1146
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,260
Oh my god.

1147
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:45,790
You...

1148
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,550
The music goes so hard.

1149
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,000
I'm trying to not...

1150
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,440
Oh my god!

1151
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:07,060
I got stuck on the wall!

1152
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:10,200
Guys, this is not the run.

1153
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,240
But that's okay.

1154
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,120
I think I did better as Trickster than Swordmaster, honestly.

1155
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,110
Oh god.

1156
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,310
This is the run.

1157
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:28,730
We still got to phase 2.

1158
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:31,430
It's like barely... We're not even halfway.

1159
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:33,070
Somehow we're at phase 2.

1160
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:33,650
It's crazy.

1161
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:37,670
I'm frozen and I'm dead.

1162
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,520
Swordmaster uses the same button as Trickster.

1163
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:45,560
No, I know.

1164
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,040
But...

1165
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:50,360
Like...

1166
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,360
So...

1167
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,940
Oh, I'm styling.

1168
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:54,600
But like, okay.

1169
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:55,980
This is what I mean.

1170
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,700
Trickster, you dodge, you guys.

1171
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:00,660
See?

1172
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,420
Trickster, dodge.

1173
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,200
Swordmaster, you're styling.

1174
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:05,200
You see?

1175
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:05,960
You see?

1176
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,160
That's what I'm talking about.

1177
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,840
Because I...

1178
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,120
I...

1179
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,620
I use it to dodge.

1180
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,400
Push it in the air.

1181
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:22,210
Jump and Swordmaster.

1182
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:24,830
So this one.

1183
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:28,750
Oh, I thought you guys were meaning like...

1184
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:32,830
I thought you meant like using just regular melee in the air.

1185
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,130
Not this in the air.

1186
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:37,570
I see.

1187
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:37,930
I see.

1188
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:38,290
I see.

1189
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:38,930
I see.

1190
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:40,530
I see.

1191
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:40,810
I see.

1192
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:41,170
I see.

1193
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:41,470
Okay.

1194
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:41,790
Okay.

1195
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:42,510
Let's try it then.

1196
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:45,450
It's a 3 hit combo.

1197
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:45,850
Okay.

1198
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:46,030
Okay.

1199
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:46,250
Okay.

1200
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:47,970
Okay.

1201
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:53,490
So...

1202
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:56,250
Oh, and I completely missed every...

1203
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,160
Jump

1204
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:20,410
back.

1205
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:22,470
I do like the dodge though.

1206
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:23,020
I'm not...

1207
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:28,450
Oops.

1208
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:28,730
Whoops.

1209
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:29,050
Wait.

1210
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:33,030
Oh fucking hell, man.

1211
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:33,690
Just kill me.

1212
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:40,470
Maybe if I...

1213
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:44,470
For that attack, switch to Trickster.

1214
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:44,970
Okay.

1215
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:53,740
Did I have the thing?

1216
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,460
Oh, I do still have it.

1217
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:55,680
Okay.

1218
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:18,150
Oh gosh.

1219
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:20,650
No!

1220
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:24,830
I'm gonna use it.

1221
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:27,630
Well...

1222
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:28,750
Yeah.

1223
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:32,070
I'll use it.

1224
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:34,110
Okay.

1225
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:36,110
Okay.

1226
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:38,910
Oh god.

1227
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,060
This sucks.

1228
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:49,700
Oh my god.

1229
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:50,060
No.

1230
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,040
That was terrible.

1231
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,780
I just wasted that Vital Star, I think, everybody.

1232
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,200
Jump!

1233
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:56,440
Nevermind.

1234
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,800
This is terrible.

1235
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,060
Jump!

1236
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,980
I keep missing when he does that though.

1237
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:43,400
Jump!

1238
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,040
Jump!

1239
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:44,560
Jump!

1240
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:51,690
And Sword Master is... Okay.

1241
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:52,930
Jump!

1242
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:55,550
Jump!

1243
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:58,050
Jump!

1244
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:01,390
Jump!

1245
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:11,940
Oh my gosh.

1246
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,280
I didn't realize what attack he was doing there.

1247
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:33,450
Oh, I missed it.

1248
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:33,950
I missed it.

1249
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:34,510
I missed it.

1250
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:36,050
No way!

1251
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:37,310
No Sword Master!

1252
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:37,750
Jump!

1253
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:40,410
I'm scared, you guys!

1254
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:40,970
I'm scared!

1255
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:46,670
Trickster?

1256
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:48,450
No!

1257
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:02,830
I'm scared!

1258
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:19,750
I panicked so hard.

1259
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:25,670
Dang, we were so close.

1260
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:28,730
Sorry, I'm getting shaky because I haven't eaten today.

1261
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:29,990
Hold on.

1262
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:46,130
Hold on, let me go get some water.

1263
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,820
Guys, I'm so sorry.

1264
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,320
I have to end stream.

1265
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,500
I'm so sorry.

1266
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,480
We will play... I will do this next week.

1267
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,240
I'm so sorry.

1268
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:12,080
I don't want... I have to end stream, so...

1269
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,460
I'm really sorry.

1270
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:19,660
Yeah, so...

1271
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,240
Yeah, I will see you guys next time.

1272
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:24,980
Thank you guys.

1273
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:25,840
I'm so sorry.

1274
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:26,800
I'm so sorry.

1275
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:27,920
I'm so sorry.

1276
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:28,820
Bye bye!

1277
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:29,740
I'm so sorry.

1278
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,780
Sorry, it's really sudden.

1279
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:31,520
I'm so sorry.

1280
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:32,620
I'm so sorry.

1281
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,260
I'm so sorry.

1282
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:34,300
Bye bye!

1283
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:34,760
Bye bye!
