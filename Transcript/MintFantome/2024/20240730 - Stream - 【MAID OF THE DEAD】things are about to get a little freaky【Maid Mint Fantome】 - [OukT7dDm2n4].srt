1
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,420
You guys couldn't hear the music!

2
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,000
Why

3
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,560
does this go so hard?

4
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,440
Why does this go so hard?

5
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,520
Viewers in the chat are expressing frustration.

6
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,000
That's the AI message.

7
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,600
I got you.

8
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,960
Thanks, Viper!

9
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,190
Oh my god.

10
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,510
My voice is not very warmed up today yet.

11
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,590
Sorry.

12
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,950
I'm just drinking my first tea also.

13
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,540
Did you make this game?

14
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,800
I might as well, right?

15
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,560
Oh

16
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:14,880
god.

17
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:23,220
Sorry, I'm like so... If you don't know, this company is called Curate, right?

18
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,620
And they make every single...

19
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,100
one of my favorite games ever.

20
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,100
If you know the Bunny Girl...

21
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,780
I have to turn it down just a little bit.

22
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,720
If you know the Bunny Girl cafe game...

23
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,260
Oh, what was it called?

24
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,240
Bunny Garden?

25
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,580
They made that too.

26
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,100
They made Bunny Garden.

27
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,440
So, you know, sometimes their games kind of blow up.

28
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,600
Oh boy.

29
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,600
Yeah.

30
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,920
They made Bunny Garden?

31
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,420
Uh-huh.

32
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:07,340
But this one is like a vampire-survivor-type game.

33
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,720
So I'm very excited.

34
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,400
Kaiten-zushi!

35
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,560
Wait.

36
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,540
So this is Akiba Station, right?

37
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,720
This Kaiten-zushi place, this rotating sushi place is actually...

38
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,860
It's not there anymore.

39
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,500
It's been... It's gone now, unfortunately.

40
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,080
Is this a spicy game then?

41
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,100
Yes.

42
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,540
Can you put yourself at the end of the maid lineup?

43
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,120
Like down here?

44
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,860
I'm in the game!

45
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,840
Oh wait.

46
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,280
There we... Wait.

47
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm covering the logo though.

48
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,180
Not as spicy as Bunny Garden or the Days games.

49
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,240
This one?

50
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,160
I think this one is pretty spicy still though.

51
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,080
I don't think Bunny Garden was that spicy.

52
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,600
From what I saw of it.

53
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,400
But I think...

54
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,600
They didn't have a green maid.

55
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,180
So true!

56
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,700
I think this one has some good spice.

57
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,380
I think this one has some good spice in it.

58
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,860
But Bunny Garden...

59
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,320
Besides like the panty shot, sometimes it wasn't that bad.

60
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,440
But...

61
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,940
But curate games can get pretty...

62
00:06:52,940 --> 00:07:00,430
I think that's also why it blew up a little bit.

63
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,330
You know?

64
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,390
It was more friendly for other people to play.

65
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,450
The mainstream masses, maybe.

66
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:12,890
But no.

67
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,470
I'm a freak.

68
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,990
I wanna play.

69
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,830
The edgier the better.

70
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,630
The edgier the better.

71
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:18,990
The edgier the better.

72
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,710
The edgier the better.

73
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,130
Yeah, more YouTube accessible.

74
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:22,730
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:22,830
The edgier the better.

76
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,390
I don't know so much about this game.

77
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,490
I've been wanting to play it since the day I saw that it was announced, though.

78
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,070
I was just like, this game is made for me!

79
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,010
I thought about you when I saw this game.

80
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,710
Thank you for thinking about me.

81
00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:00,030
Also, the same company made Trouble Days, which also went kind of viral.

82
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,030
Oh,

83
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,840
and also the hotel, Izanami Hotel.

84
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,840
They make such a wide variety, which I really like.

85
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,440
And they're always kind of changing the kind of gameplay, so I appreciate that, too.

86
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,660
Livestream.

87
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,360
I love edgy games!

88
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,760
But this one is about maids.

89
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,240
It takes place in Akihabara.

90
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,980
And I actually really like Vampire Survivor-type games.

91
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,780
I haven't played Vampire Survivors...

92
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,860
Am I tilted?

93
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,860
Can't tell.

94
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,720
Anyway, I haven't played Vampire Survivors itself, but I've played Vampire Survivor-type games.

95
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,940
I really like them, so...

96
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,080
Eye Tracker!

97
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,720
Oh!

98
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,420
I can't do the Eye Tracker!

99
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,740
No!

100
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,980
My setup for it is on the other monitor.

101
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,260
I can't.

102
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,760
Oh, no!

103
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,400
Thank you, Mint!

104
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,220
Excited to watch this.

105
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,400
Yippee!

106
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,300
Thanks for the iron cyber!

107
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,400
Thank you!

108
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:31,920
Dang.

109
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,660
Maybe if I play it again...

110
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,360
I just got here.

111
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,740
What is this?

112
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,160
What is this game?

113
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,040
Well, it's a Vampire Survivor-type game with edgy maids.

114
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,020
And some visual novel aspect.

115
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,560
No Eye Tracker needed... right now.

116
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,300
Let's just get into it, though.

117
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,560
It happened suddenly, without warning.

118
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,720
It happened suddenly, without warning.

119
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,860
I don't have time to understand what's going on.

120
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,200
There wasn't even enough time to try and comprehend what was going on.

121
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:26,000
But I just found out that there were a lot of people who suddenly lost their minds and started attacking other people.

122
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,240
The only thing that was certain was that some people had lost their minds and started attacking others.

123
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,980
I'm so sorry.

124
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,260
I don't know why my voice is very weird today.

125
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,400
My everyday life is always sounding and falling apart.

126
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,440
I can't help it.

127
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,140
All we could do was just run away.

128
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,020
As our peaceful lives started to slowly crumble around us, all we could do was run.

129
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,140
It's weird.

130
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,880
Yeah, my voice is really rough for you.

131
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,200
I think because... well, I didn't just wake up.

132
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,840
Oh my god!

133
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,520
Look at the...

134
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,780
Wait, I'm blocking.

135
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,400
Look at the guy I'm blocking.

136
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,640
And this guy over here...

137
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,540
He has like the pen lights and everything.

138
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,600
Those do not look like normal pen lights though.

139
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,820
Those look like...

140
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,740
Those look like...

141
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,720
Traff... or like plain traffic lights.

142
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,800
Akihabura.

143
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,120
Yes, Akihabura.

144
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,240
Look, we have games instead of gamers.

145
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,600
Gaox.

146
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,900
So funny.

147
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,660
The maid even.

148
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,360
So cute.

149
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,880
But the pachinko and slot stays there, baby.

150
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,100
Oh!

151
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,560
Hobby paradise.

152
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,140
Hulks instead of Valks.

153
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,220
Vulks, I mean.

154
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,500
Sorry.

155
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,620
This way is no good too.

156
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,240
There seems to be a lot of zombie looking things here as well.

157
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,420
You should not give up Rinka!

158
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,620
There might be other ways to escape!

159
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,780
We can't give up Rinka.

160
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,660
There has to be an escape route somewhere.

161
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,660
I know.

162
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,900
Yeah, I know.

163
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,340
But then we'll have to go outside if we are left out with the zombies.

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,140
We can go and stay inside a building.

165
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,060
We can't stay outside like this.

166
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,380
We'll be hunted down in no time.

167
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,880
Maybe it would be better to seek shelter in a building or something.

168
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,360
Nagisa, would you like to walk?

169
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,260
Vulks wagon?

170
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,460
Nagisa, can you walk?

171
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:44,880
You know that I'm tougher than I look.

172
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,700
I'm just twisting my ankle a little.

173
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,560
I'll be fine.

174
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,880
She's been bit.

175
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:56,120
I think Nagisa's the type to be bit and then... I just met her, but I think she's the type to be bit and not tell anybody.

176
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,680
Then let's go.

177
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,140
Nagisa's gonna die.

178
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,840
No, we won't let any of our precious maids die.

179
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,500
Oh, their maid outfits are so cute.

180
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,400
I like the ribbons.

181
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,420
They're like cross ribbons on this one.

182
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, you can't see.

183
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,380
This seems like a good place to hide for now, yeah?

184
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,320
Oh my god, we're at Toli's!

185
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,480
I mean... Oli's?

186
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,000
Have you played any of the Akiba's Trip games?

187
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,580
I've heard...

188
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,340
I've also heard of the anime... Also, have you heard of the anime ZOM100?

189
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,920
I have heard of the anime ZOM100, but I have not watched it.

190
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,980
And yes, I've played Akiba's Trip.

191
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,900
I have.

192
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,160
I have.

193
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,300
She's already turning.

194
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,740
Looks good.

195
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,740
Just gonna close my eyes and rest for a bit.

196
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,060
Oh god, Nagisa!

197
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,480
Oh my god, she's about to die for real.

198
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,180
Oh, Nagisa.

199
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,120
Uh oh.

200
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:55,660
Nagisa?

201
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,060
I'm fine.

202
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,540
I'm fine.

203
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,420
She's bitten for sure?

204
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,060
Oh god.

205
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm fine, really.

206
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,840
I don't look fine at all.

207
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,700
I just sprained my ankle.

208
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know why I look so pale.

209
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,620
You're not fine at all.

210
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,420
There's no way this is from a sprained ankle.

211
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,460
I'm fine.

212
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,100
I just ran while holding my ankle.

213
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,700
I'm just a little tired.

214
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,820
Trust me, I'm okay.

215
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,260
Just a little tired from having to compensate for my ankle.

216
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,020
That's all.

217
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,480
That's fine.

218
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,600
If you're sure... Oh god, Rinka, run!

219
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,540
Run!

220
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,180
It looks like it's going to be hard for me to run and escape like this.

221
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,540
They're moving faster than I thought.

222
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,660
Oh no.

223
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,740
Either way, it might be a bit difficult to continue and try to outrun them.

224
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,900
They're quicker than they look.

225
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,200
You're right.

226
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,160
I don't think I have the confidence to run away like this.

227
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,260
You're right.

228
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,720
And I don't really have the confidence with this leg of mine.

229
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,780
In the first place, what do you think that zombie is?

230
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,040
What do you think that zombie is?

231
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Actually, it was all a movie shoot.

232
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,380
What do you think that zombie is?

233
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,100
What do you think that zombie -like things are anyway?

234
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,900
You don't think we got trapped on a movie set or something, do you?

235
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,440
Wasn't that a TV show?

236
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,700
Like a Korean TV show?

237
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,940
Where they had people sign up and think that they were going on a different type of reality show.

238
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,420
And then they actually instead...

239
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,300
It was supposed to be like a zombie apocalypse happened.

240
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:25,760
And then they actually instead...

241
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:25,760
It was supposed to be like a zombie apocalypse happened.

242
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,600
And then they actually instead...

243
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,820
That feels very illegal.

244
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,780
I'm in.

245
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,420
I can't wait to finally meet you at OTAC.

246
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,280
OTAC.

247
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,460
I'll come to the meet and greet cosplay with you as you are the twist.

248
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,980
I hope you can accept gifts.

249
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,340
I made a cute skirt and hair bow.

250
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,780
Thank you.

251
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,700
Oh my gosh.

252
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm so excited to see.

253
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,180
Thank you.

254
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,180
Oh my gosh.

255
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,180
I'm so excited to see.

256
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,180
Thank you.

257
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,400
Oh my gosh.

258
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I'm so excited to see.

259
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,180
Sounds familiar.

260
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,020
I think it was that.

261
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,500
Right, Tao?

262
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,380
I think it was that.

263
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:55,740
Right, Tao?

264
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,840
Oh my gosh, instead of it was a...

265
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,240
But I think it had to be very obviously like...

266
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,540
It's not a real zombie apocalypse.

267
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,680
Or else you'd really panic.

268
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,300
But you know.

269
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,760
The green maid in the bottom right is defo a freak.

270
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,960
What do you think those zombie-like things are anyway?

271
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,600
You don't think we got... Oh, movies chat.

272
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:14,940
That's right.

273
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,540
People wouldn't be dying on a movie set.

274
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Besides, Akihabara is in total chaos.

275
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,100
I guess you have a point.

276
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,600
A guitarist is shredding.

277
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,000
Right!

278
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,660
All we know is that being bitten by one of them will also turn you into a zombie!

279
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,940
Before we know it, Akihabara could be filled with zombies!

280
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,740
I hope everyone at the maid cafe was able to make it out okay.

281
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,540
This is the sequel to Akihabara Maid Wars, everybody.

282
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,440
Who knows?

283
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,080
I mean, we were out handing flyers, so it's hard to say what happened.

284
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,440
All we can do is pray.

285
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,360
I actually got my pants up in this game.

286
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:17,760
Crazy.

287
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,260
It's only a matter of time before they make it here too.

288
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,760
We need to find a safe place to take shelter.

289
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,740
Hey, Rinko-chan.

290
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,520
Leave me here.

291
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:31,960
Leave me here.

292
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,520
Rinko, it's okay to leave me behind!

293
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,300
Rinko, it's okay to leave me behind!

294
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,420
Don't tell me you're kidding me at a time like this.

295
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,360
Now's not the time for jokes.

296
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,960
I can't run away with these legs.

297
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,840
But Rinko-chan can run.

298
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,440
But Rinko-chan can run.

299
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,520
You know that I won't be able to run with this leg of mine, but you can, right?

300
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,380
She just doesn't want to tell her that she's been bit.

301
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,480
But she's definitely been bit.

302
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,420
But she's definitely been bit.

303
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,680
She just doesn't want to tell her that she's been bit.

304
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:57,820
She doesn't want to tell her that she's been bit.

305
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,520
She just wants to lessen the guilt.

306
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:01,560
She just wants to lessen the guilt.

307
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,440
Bustin', bustin', bustin'.

308
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,520
I'm not trying to be a hero or anything.

309
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,920
I just think it'd be better for you to go on ahead.

310
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,280
A-aheyed.

311
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,060
A-aheyed.

312
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,720
To look for help for the both of us.

313
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,360
No.

314
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,260
I can't do that.

315
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,180
Why not?

316
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,160
You know deep down it's the right thing to do.

317
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,720
I'm just gonna drag you down like this.

318
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,180
Why not?

319
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,380
You know deep down it's the right thing to do.

320
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,620
I'm just gonna drag you down like this.

321
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,040
Splitting up for a bit is what's best for the both of us.

322
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,620
Also, let me know if the audio is okay.

323
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,080
I've been trying to have it not be so loud, but also so you can make sure you hear it.

324
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,240
Whoever gets to be a sub, thank you.

325
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,860
Thank you for the Super Chat boost!

326
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,540
Thank you!

327
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,720
Two EU-friendly streams in a week?

328
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,620
Am I losing it?

329
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,060
Hello!

330
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,120
There's no other option, Nagisa.

331
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,920
There's no other option, Nagisa.

332
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,000
Look here?

333
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,560
Uh-oh.

334
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,520
Did Rinka get bit?

335
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,340
Wait!

336
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,370
We were wrong!

337
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,270
Nice!

338
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,650
What a twist!

339
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,130
What a twist!

340
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,630
Rinka!

341
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,110
Wait, when did...

342
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,190
How did this happen?

343
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,090
How did you not...

344
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,090
How did you not notice this?

345
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,390
Sorry,

346
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,450
I'm trying not to be a censor, you know?

347
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,250
Just get me off the screen.

348
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,090
Here, here, here.

349
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:55,890
Here, here, here.

350
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,190
Um...

351
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,050
Everybody, take your peek.

352
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,090
Get your sneak peek.

353
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,490
Get your little...

354
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,410
Get your little fill.

355
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,970
I don't know how her skirt's doing that, to be honest.

356
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,630
But...

357
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,470
Thank you, Minto.

358
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,190
You're welcome.

359
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,550
I think I was bitten earlier while running away.

360
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,590
I can feel myself starting to lose control!

361
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,150
No way!

362
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,610
No way!

363
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,470
No way!

364
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,930
If that happens, I might attack you.

365
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,450
Soon enough, I'll lose control and become just like those zombies.

366
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:35,930
Soon enough, I'll lose control and become just like those zombies.

367
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,410
There's a big chance I'll attack you, too!

368
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,430
That's why...

369
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,290
I'll say goodbye here.

370
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,630
I'll lure as many zombies as I can and go far away.

371
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,110
I'll lure as many zombies as I can and go far away.

372
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,690
This is where I say goodbye.

373
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,190
I'll do my best to lure them far away from here.

374
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,970
If you press it, if you click on it...

375
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,250
Nothing happens.

376
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,270
You don't need to do that!

377
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,710
If you go far away, I'll get you healed!

378
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,230
You don't need to do that!

379
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,790
Wait, I did say Rinka's line, right?

380
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,990
She's gonna run away and lure them away?

381
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,830
You don't need to do that!

382
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,130
Rinka...

383
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,670
Sorry, Nagisa.

384
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:14,770
Live.

385
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,650
Even if it's just you.

386
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,570
Wouldn't it be so funny if Nagisa went like, Wouldn't it be so funny if Nagisa went like, But Rinka!

387
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:27,750
and then showed her her bite, too, and was just like, Bite me, Rinka!

388
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,130
Bite me, Rinka!

389
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,010
Down, boy, down!

390
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,870
Down, boy, down!

391
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,330
You just met her.

392
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,770
Promise me you'll live.

393
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,150
For my sake, too.

394
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:40,770
Oh!

395
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,290
Spaghetti!

396
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,230
Wait, please!

397
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:47,690
Rinka-chan!

398
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,890
Oh, no!

399
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,130
The usual daily life sounds and collapses.

400
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,150
I watched as my life crumbled around me.

401
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:09,650
All I could do was reach my hand out to Rinka's back as it slipped further and further away from me.

402
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,590
Oh!

403
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,170
Rinka-chan?

404
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,030
When she was happy and healthy and not a zombie.

405
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,070
Wait, are we gonna see her, like, transform?

406
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,810
I'm so glad!

407
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:21,950
I'm so glad!

408
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,450
I'm so glad!

409
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,370
You're all right!

410
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:24,770
Rinka-chan?

411
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,390
Wait a minute!

412
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,470
Where are you going?

413
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,590
She's dreaming about her.

414
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,050
I'm begging you!

415
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:36,710
Oh!

416
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,740
Stop, this looks just like Crepscule maid cafe.

417
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,980
Oh, is everything okay then?

418
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,240
It was a dream?

419
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,000
It looks like she woke up.

420
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,360
You're finally awake.

421
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,280
It seems.

422
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,320
Oh!

423
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,400
Oh!

424
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,460
Cute!

425
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,340
Oh my gosh, she's so cute!

426
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
She's so cute!

427
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,460
Oh my god, stop.

428
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,640
I swear, the art keeps getting better and better in these games.

429
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,420
Color?

430
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,140
Mint color!

431
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,600
This game was made for me!

432
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,860
Who are you?

433
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,520
How did I end up in such a place?

434
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,120
You seem a little confused.

435
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,900
Being caught up in such a pandemic makes it more difficult to stay in a good mood.

436
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,800
Seems like you're a bit confused.

437
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,680
But I guess that's to be expected after being involved in such a pandemic.

438
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,680
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

439
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,420
Pandemic?

440
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
A pandemic?

441
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,980
I'm Kanon Mikagami.

442
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,100
I'm Kanon Mikagami.

443
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,820
I was thinking of using this cafe as a base, but you fell down in the store, so I had to protect you.

444
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,960
I thought this shop would be a good place to hide, but you seem to have found it first.

445
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,300
I patched you up a bit.

446
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,480
Pandemic?

447
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,860
I think this is more like an epidemic.

448
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,240
I think we're in big trouble.

449
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,440
A shop?

450
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,920
Oh, right.

451
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,820
You mean this mint cafe.

452
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,320
This is the maid cafe where Rinka and I used to work.

453
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,100
Rinka and I used to work here, actually.

454
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,660
Rinka and I used to work here, actually.

455
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,200
After I broke up with Rinka, I'll be back here again.

456
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,420
I'll be back here again.

457
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,280
I'll be back here again.

458
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,560
I'll be back here again.

459
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,120
Pandemic is bigger than an epidemic though?

460
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,820
Is it actually?

461
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,800
Wait, I always thought that it was the opposite.

462
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,040
I thought epidemic was the worst one.

463
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,600
I'd call it an apocalypse.

464
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,860
Oh, epidemic is more small...

465
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,480
Oh...

466
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,700
I thought pa...pani...

467
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,300
Oh, everything.

468
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:05,150
Epidemic, I think to me it just sounds like epicdemic.

469
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,790
So it's...

470
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,490
So in my brain, I'm just like...

471
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,630
It's epically bad.

472
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,520
So that's why I always thought that it was worse than pandemic.

473
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,260
Kind of makes sense.

474
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,180
Though it doesn't.

475
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,420
An epicdemic.

476
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,440
I guess after splitting with Rinka, I ran all the way out here without realizing...

477
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,440
What if she's...

478
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,760
What if Rinka is immune, you know?

479
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,420
What if she's...

480
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:55,440
What if Rinka is immune, you know?

481
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,740
Luckily there were no zombies around, so I took the time to set some precautions up.

482
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,540
I've decided to use this place as my base.

483
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,000
The SSR Demic.

484
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,100
The SSR Demic.

485
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,880
This is from the livestream devs.

486
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,400
Yep, yep, yep.

487
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,440
Spent the whole day setting up the fence and doing some maintenance.

488
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,920
It should be worth it to keep the zombies away.

489
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,660
It should be worth it to keep the zombies away.

490
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,700
It's different from the usual maid cafe.

491
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,480
W-Wait a minute!

492
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,900
Did you say it was the first day?

493
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:25,720
Did you say it was the first day?

494
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,820
Did you say it was the first day?

495
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,240
Did you say it was the first day?

496
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,520
Yanwei, thank you!

497
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,280
Easy to remember.

498
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,960
Pan, like pansexual.

499
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,940
Thank you.

500
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,880
Freaky Demic.

501
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,760
Seems like a majority of survivors are people who don't wear pants.

502
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,240
True!

503
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,680
I wonder if there's a lot of survivors in Scotland.

504
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,440
You're right, it does look a bit different.

505
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,140
Wait, you said you did all of this in one day?

506
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,440
Yes.

507
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,120
To be more precise, I found you.

508
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,520
28 hours and 32 minutes have passed since I found you.

509
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:00,820
28 hours and 32 minutes have passed since I found you.

510
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,020
How long were you asleep?

511
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,320
To be exact, it took 28 hours and 32 minutes after finding you and patching you up.

512
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,020
That long?

513
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,840
What happened to Akihabara since then?

514
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,100
I've been out that long?

515
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,620
What happened to Akihabara?

516
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,000
Uh oh.

517
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,300
It's better not to go outside.

518
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,800
The number of zombies that appeared in Akihabara is still increasing.

519
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,380
I wouldn't go out there if I were you.

520
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,180
The number of zombies keeps going up.

521
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,140
Then I can't just sit around and do nothing.

522
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,460
That's more of a reason to go out there and do something.

523
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,680
That's more of a reason to go out there and do something.

524
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,040
I might still be out there!

525
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,120
I need to go help her!

526
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,760
Rinko, my friend might still be out there!

527
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,000
I need to go save her!

528
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,660
I can't do anything on my own.

529
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,560
Mr. Nagisa Hihara.

530
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,240
Oh, how does she know my name?

531
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,520
I can't have you going off on your own, Ms. Nagisa Hihara.

532
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,720
Did I tell you my name?

533
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,180
Did I tell you my name?

534
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,560
Your student ID was in your pocket.

535
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:00,800
Did I tell you my name?

536
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,460
Your student ID was in your pocket.

537
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,260
Oh, she's a freak.

538
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,920
Why were you trying... she was trying to rob me!

539
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,840
Why were you trying... she was trying to rob me!

540
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,240
She pickpocketed me.

541
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,560
The sleeves... I know Kanon is so cute.

542
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,240
You won't be leaving here.

543
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,360
I can't have you go out there only to be turned into a zombie once you do.

544
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,180
I can't have you go out there only to be turned into a zombie once you do.

545
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,780
Why are Kanon's hands like that?

546
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,060
Why are Kanon's hands like that?

547
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,760
Why are you so rude?

548
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,340
You're an all too important test subject for us.

549
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:35,600
You're an all too important test subject for us.

550
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,160
One that's carrying a very specific antibody.

551
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:38,800
One that's carrying a very specific antibody.

552
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,780
Oh my god, she already.

553
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,980
She did experiments on me in my sleep.

554
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,260
Oh my god, she already.

555
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,260
She did experiments on me in my sleep.

556
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,800
Sample?

557
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,540
I'm a test subject?

558
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,520
Yes.

559
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,700
I am a very valuable sample.

560
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,920
Mr. Nagisa, what do you think about the appearance of zombies?

561
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,980
Mr. Nagisa, what do you think about the appearance of zombies?

562
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,000
Yes.

563
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,700
A very rare one at bat.

564
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,080
Yes.

565
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,080
A very rare one at bat.

566
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,780
Why do you think those zombies suddenly appeared, Ms. Nagisa?

567
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,160
Well, it's common in movies.

568
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,960
Well, it's common in movies.

569
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,980
So she did get bitten, right?

570
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,180
That's what it sounds like, right?

571
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,460
What are we?

572
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,400
Umbrella corporation?

573
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:26,220
If we're going by movie logic, maybe an unknown virus spread from one person to the next, or something.

574
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,920
You got it.

575
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,120
It's believed... Sorry.

576
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,840
It's believed that the reason these zombies appeared in Akihabara is because of a pandemic causing virus.

577
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:02,560
From what we know so far, the only way for this virus to spread is through bodily fluid from zombie to person.

578
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,200
So this is the reason, right?

579
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,340
Ah, well...

580
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,600
Bodily fluid.

581
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,820
That's why zombie bites are so deadly.

582
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,020
If there's saliva or blood enters your system, it's game over.

583
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,460
Rinka!

584
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,400
Oh, the panty shot.

585
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,620
Are we gonna smooch some zombies?

586
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,780
In a few hours, they'll spawn and turn into zombies.

587
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,820
From my observations, it seems most infected humans will transform instantly.

588
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,060
Though the latest is a couple of hours, so Rinka...

589
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,620
Rinka started to turn pretty quickly, she said.

590
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,540
She was starting to lose control.

591
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,580
So we did get bit.

592
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,100
A few individuals carry a special antibody.

593
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,680
Oh my gosh, maybe I should've made coffee instead of tea.

594
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,260
It seems like you're one of those people, Miss Nagisa.

595
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,000
W-w-w-w-wait

596
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,180
a second!

597
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,180
Antibodies?

598
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,560
As in the things that protect you from getting colds?

599
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,060
Yes.

600
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,080
In conclusion, you are already infected.

601
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,340
W-w-w-w-wait!

602
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,840
Precisely.

603
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,100
This might be a bit frank, but you've already been infected!

604
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,260
Probably, when you're running away from zombies, you'll be bitten before you know it.

605
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,100
We knew it!

606
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,840
More than likely, you were bit at some point when running away.

607
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,240
The Ulmer Reismaner.

608
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,540
But for some reason, your body hasn't reacted.

609
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,020
You're completely symptom-free, which means you must have that antibody.

610
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,020
Does that mean we can make an antidote with this antibody of mine?

611
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,820
That's exactly what I've been researching here.

612
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,860
Oh my god.

613
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,060
What a perfect research location.

614
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,980
Kiss your friend to cure.

615
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,300
I've made a vaccine prototype from your blood.

616
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,440
Oh my god, she's already taken my blood and everything!

617
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,020
But it'll still need to undergo some more modifications and tests.

618
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,800
Amazing!

619
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,320
With that vaccine, I can make a zombie!

620
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,360
Waku-chin.

621
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,700
Oh gosh, I learned that word in 2020.

622
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,440
Waku-chin.

623
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,220
That's vaccine.

624
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,320
That's amazing!

625
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,680
With such a vaccine, we'd be able to turn zombies back into humans, right?

626
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,760
No, it's not that useful.

627
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:58,720
Even if you've become a complete zombie, you won't be able to save yourself.

628
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,380
Waku-chin.

629
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,180
Waku-waku-chin-chin.

630
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,780
Yeah, waku-waku-chin-chin.

631
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,600
Sadly, no.

632
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,940
Even if we administered the vaccine to someone who was fully turned, they wouldn't be able to revert back.

633
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,940
Those who have been infected, but have not yet been infected...

634
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,400
Waku-waku-chin-chin!

635
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,960
Or those who have not been infected, the main purpose is to prevent them.

636
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,960
But it could be used to prevent full transformations of people who've been bitten or prevent someone from becoming infected.

637
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,700
Besides, this is nothing more than a prototype.

638
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,180
In a place like this, we can't develop a proper vaccine.

639
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,660
We haven't done any clinical trials, and we don't know if it's really effective.

640
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,920
Their major... they... they... they are...

641
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,160
They are... they are...

642
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:59,080
They are... there are major limitations when working somewhere like this.

643
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,300
I haven't even been able to test it.

644
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,720
So I don't even know how effective it is.

645
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,340
They are... they are...

646
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,260
I don't care.

647
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,420
Even if it was only a 1% chance, I'd still take the gamble.

648
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,240
What are you saying?

649
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,540
I told you, a friend of mine is still outside.

650
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,480
Oh, gosh.

651
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,240
A friend of hers, you guys.

652
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,380
A friend of hers.

653
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,880
She was bitten, but this vaccine might be able to save her if she hasn't fully transformed.

654
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,640
Were you listening?

655
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,080
There's no guarantee that this vaccine will work.

656
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,520
Yeah, but Kanon, weren't you listening?

657
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,020
Were you even listening to what I said?

658
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,060
No one knows how effective this vaccine is.

659
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,820
And Nagisa said that she would take the 1% chance.

660
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,500
Well, that friend of hers...

661
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,580
It was Rinka.

662
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,740
She's been bitten for at least 28 hours.

663
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,160
And your friend, Rinka, wasn't it?

664
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,700
Well, it's been at least 28 hours since she was bitten.

665
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,740
It's normal to think that she's already become a zombie.

666
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,920
She's more than likely...

667
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,820
As long as it doesn't happen, there's nothing we can do to save her.

668
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,060
Hmm...

669
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,840
Oh, she's more than likely turned into a zombie by now.

670
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,500
A miracle would have to happen to save her.

671
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,040
She has those crazy eyes.

672
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,480
Nagisa looks crazy right now.

673
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,220
She's like...

674
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,820
And I told you, didn't I?

675
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,980
It doesn't matter.

676
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,100
Even if it's a 1% chance, I'd do anything for my friend.

677
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,420
Seems like you won't listen to reason.

678
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,000
I'll help you find Rinka.

679
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,560
If you're going to be that way, then I'll be...

680
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,800
I'll be helping look for Ms. Rinka to...

681
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,580
Nino?

682
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,040
Are you sure?

683
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,900
Even if I can convince her here, she'll sneak out her vaccine.

684
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,980
Even if I ended up convincing you, I'm sure you'd still sneak off with the vaccine anyway.

685
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,480
Okay, okay.

686
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,320
I think we need to be a little bit more like practical about this, right?

687
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:22,820
Like this...

688
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,980
This might be the only person that we know of that...

689
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,260
has an antibody to this virus.

690
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,860
And we're just going to let her go?

691
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,480
We're not going to...

692
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,080
We need to take like notes.

693
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,020
We need to...

694
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:40,360
We need to document our research in case somebody does find this and is able to then see everything and create a cure.

695
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,240
We need to take ample, ample amounts of her blood, you know?

696
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,480
To like have it as extra so that it can be continued research.

697
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,740
We need Rinka.

698
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,220
If you're going to do that, you need to prepare a weapon first.

699
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,280
A weapon!

700
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,640
I'm sorry, but please take that with you.

701
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,560
That's one of my favorite Japanese words.

702
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:04,980
A weapon.

703
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,320
If we're going outside, we'll have to prepare some weapons.

704
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,700
They're makeshift, but we don't have much of a choice.

705
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,720
Please take this.

706
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,180
That's...

707
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,600
Wait, but that's...

708
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
A gun!

709
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,880
It's an assault rifle.

710
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,320
It's an assault rifle?

711
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:21,960
You've seen it in movies, right?

712
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,940
I'm sure you've seen one in a movie or something.

713
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,840
Totally makeshift assault rifle.

714
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,300
It's real?

715
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,740
Not just like some toy?

716
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,860
I'd be arrested for carrying this.

717
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,400
Martial law.

718
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,280
Obviously, the police have been infected too.

719
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,140
Now's not the time to worry about laws.

720
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,700
Please learn how to defend yourself with it.

721
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,720
You made a vaccine?

722
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,860
And you even have this weapon?

723
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:01,900
Really?

724
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,790
You made a vaccine?

725
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:05,950
And collected weapons?

726
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,730
Kanon, who exactly are you?

727
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:13,390
I can't move from here to make a vaccine, but...

728
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,550
It's pink.

729
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,550
It's so cute.

730
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,630
If you need anything, please contact me through the mobile phone.

731
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,970
Oh, her trigger discipline though.

732
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,810
Oh, she does...

733
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,290
Never mind.

734
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:24,430
I'm sorry.

735
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,490
I'm so sorry.

736
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,570
I thought that...

737
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,010
Never mind.

738
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,090
I made...

739
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:28,790
It was...

740
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,350
Oh, it was hidden by the bar.

741
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:30,790
That's why.

742
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,110
Wow.

743
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:32,590
Okay.

744
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,170
Glasses girl is still...

745
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,710
Glasses girls are cute.

746
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:37,690
So true.

747
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,070
Thank God.

748
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,460
I can't leave here as I'll be working on the vaccine, but please contact me using this communicator if you need me.

749
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,340
My codec frequency is...

750
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,520
Please don't make me do anything stupid.

751
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,640
Please don't make me do anything stupid.

752
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,640
Please don't make me do anything stupid.

753
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:57,660
Please don't make me do anything stupid.

754
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,020
Please don't be reckless.

755
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,660
You're one in a million after all.

756
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,240
Y-Yes...

757
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,400
Okay.

758
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,560
Anyway, I have to go help Rinka.

759
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,580
I should think of other things after that.

760
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,760
For starters, I need to rescue Rinka.

761
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,920
I can think about the rest after that.

762
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,640
Oh, tutorial time.

763
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,040
The main objective of any stage is to clear it while staying away from danger.

764
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,640
However, each stage will have a different feeling.

765
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,540
Additional Conditions.

766
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:31,840
Oh, oh.

767
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,360
Your equipped gun will automatically shoot.

768
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,080
Oh, okay.

769
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,860
The trajectory can be changed to shoot behind by pressing LB.

770
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:42,780
LB?

771
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,380
Like on my mouse?

772
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,660
You can lock on your shooting...

773
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,100
Oh, by pressing LB, you can lock on your shooting trajectory separate to your movement.

774
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,000
You can switch between lock on by holding down or lock on toggle in the options.

775
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,820
Is this made Vampire Survivors?

776
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,680
Yes, actually.

777
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,160
Oh!

778
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,780
By pressing...

779
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,960
Wait, should this be played with a controller?

780
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,600
Uh-oh.

781
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,120
Close-range attack?

782
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,700
You can attack with a close-range weapon in your arsenal.

783
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,420
Weapons can only be used after the weapon gauge fills up.

784
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,570
I play mouse plus keyboard?

785
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:19,070
Oh, wait.

786
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,830
Choosing a skill.

787
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,450
Collecting powers that enemies drop will increase your level.

788
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,550
You can gain new skills by choosing them when you level up.

789
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,210
Oh, okay.

790
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:26,950
Let's see what we got.

791
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:28,610
Grenade...

792
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:29,850
Landmine...

793
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,350
Special.

794
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,810
If the same skill is selected, its skill level will increase.

795
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,010
The level cap differs based on each skill.

796
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,450
Some skills do not level up.

797
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,570
The number of skills that can increase in battle are limited.

798
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,130
Some skills allow additional effects on selected skills.

799
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,830
Choose the right skills for the right situation.

800
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:51,830
Let's go.

801
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:06,940
Let's see.

802
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,460
Support attack drone.

803
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,260
Now it's a burst fire gun.

804
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,580
HP auto heals.

805
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,400
Wait, but I'm not hurt.

806
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,700
Increase defense by 9%.

807
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,700
Increase movement by 5%.

808
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,260
Attack...

809
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,460
This sounds nice, though.

810
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:31,800
The drone.

811
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
Have some health.

812
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,840
Look at him.

813
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,240
He's going.

814
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,100
He's going for it.

815
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:39,640
Oh, gosh.

816
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,660
Oh, nice.

817
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,880
More drone.

818
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,200
The increase is cool down.

819
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,200
Oh, nice.

820
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,260
More drone.

821
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,620
No way.

822
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,740
More drones.

823
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,640
Oh my god.

824
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,140
More drones.

825
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,900
I don't want to have to do any work.

826
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,060
Oh my god.

827
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,390
I think you guys know the deal.

828
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:28,810
More drones!

829
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,550
Oh, power increase.

830
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:31,390
Okay.

831
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,470
Increases drone strength!

832
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,110
Increases... oh wait.

833
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,970
Increases drone strength by 50%.

834
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:41,490
Never mind.

835
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:43,870
More drone!

836
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:44,070
More drone!

837
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,890
Oh, hell yeah.

838
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,310
I'm so slow, it's painful.

839
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,890
Okay, next thing.

840
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,510
If I can increase my speed...

841
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,490
I will do so.

842
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:56,970
I'm so slow.

843
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,490
Increases maximum HP.

844
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,370
This game looks cute, right?

845
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,490
Drone-chan, my beloved.

846
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,130
Well, we have no more drones.

847
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:10,750
Wait!

848
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,030
Decreases...

849
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,150
Let's do...

850
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,830
Let's do the attack cooldown.

851
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,360
Die, zombie!

852
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,940
Look at the little otaku!

853
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,780
Otaku chomen!

854
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,510
As your fellow otaku, I'm so sorry!

855
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,810
I'm so sorry!

856
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,190
I can't tell where...

857
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,470
Where my other drones are attacking.

858
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,010
Oh my gosh, there's so many zombies over here.

859
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,110
Oh, I'm...

860
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:46,330
Is there a place I'm supposed to be going?

861
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:49,070
I think I just last... I think I just survive.

862
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:49,570
Right?

863
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:51,990
Oh!

864
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,870
Oh, there's so many!

865
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:55,690
Oh!

866
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,370
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

867
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,770
More drones!

868
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,410
Wait, a drone that circles...

869
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,750
the area while shooting...

870
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,390
lightning!

871
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:09,330
I think we need...

872
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:09,950
some more drones.

873
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,090
Electric drone!

874
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,050
That's technically another drone.

875
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:17,570
So...

876
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,510
Technically it's own drone.

877
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,240
Nice.

878
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,480
Drone flight time.

879
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,460
Let's do optimize.

880
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,320
Sorry, drones.

881
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:37,900
Oh!

882
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:43,560
Okay, that was a fun little tutorial level.

883
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,160
SRank.

884
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,020
She hates drones.

885
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:53,840
No!

886
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,640
No!

887
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,500
No!

888
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,560
Oh my god!

889
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,300
This is where big camera is.

890
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,840
I know exactly where this is.

891
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:07,980
This corner.

892
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,920
And then if you turn around, that's where the sign...

893
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,320
like over on this side is the sign with the...

894
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,360
like the famous at home sign...

895
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,300
and everything.

896
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,080
Yeah, I know exactly where we are.

897
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:20,700
Yeah, I know exactly where we are.

898
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,460
Yeah,

899
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,380
I know exactly where we are.

900
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,100
Thank you.

901
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,940
Hi-to-sation.

902
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,780
Is that Taito?

903
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,320
It is!

904
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,380
This is where those horrible...

905
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,380
Those guys are at.

906
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,120
Blip.

907
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,620
Remember the basics of CQC or just use...

908
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,580
more drones!

909
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,500
Wait a sec.

910
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,740
Don't just throw me into a horde of zombies!

911
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,460
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

912
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,600
I don't even know how to use a drone!

913
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,020
I've never even trained in a battle like this before!

914
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,640
I still don't know how to use a gun!

915
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,680
Nor have I ever trained in any type of combat!

916
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,580
That's why we just use drones!

917
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,020
It's okay.

918
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,400
Thanks to the virus...

919
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,620
Nagisa's physical abilities...

920
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,400
are way better than normal people's.

921
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,980
She's a super human!

922
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,340
Oh my gosh!

923
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,840
Thanks to the virus, you've become a lot stronger than the average person.

924
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:22,220
Eh?

925
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,520
Not the codec.

926
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,200
With the international sports competition...

927
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,740
you can win all the gold medals.

928
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:29,760
Get off!

929
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,600
Thanks for three months!

930
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,700
You can be a champion...

931
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,540
A genome soldier?

932
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:34,940
No!

933
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:36,880
Neuromachines?

934
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,260
No!

935
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,340
Oh yeah.

936
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:38,940
I also...

937
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,020
I made the blood purple.

938
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,140
So if you see the purple on the ground...

939
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,960
I thought it would be kinda cute.

940
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,620
What are the zombies doing that they're blowing up the top of buildings?

941
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,160
What are the zombies doing that they're blowing up the top of buildings?

942
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,680
If you were to enter any international sports competition right now...

943
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,640
If you were to enter any international sports competition right now...

944
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,240
You'd have to win gold.

945
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,900
The Olympics are happening right now.

946
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,540
Even stronger than those military personnel over there.

947
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,100
That strong?

948
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,280
I'm not that strong...

949
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,300
I'm that strong?

950
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:09,940
I'm that strong?

951
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:10,940
I don't really feel any different.

952
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:15,340
But her strength does not equate to her knowing how to use a gun.

953
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,760
Purple blood?

954
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,300
What is this?

955
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,480
Maid girl Danganronpa?

956
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,660
Maid girl Danganronpa?

957
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,140
Yes.

958
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,420
Thanks for three months, Sasha!

959
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,840
Thank you for the EU-friendly stream.

960
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,420
Of course!

961
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,360
I mean, you completely swept away that horde of zombies, right?

962
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,200
Not many people could do that by themselves.

963
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,900
And it's not just your strength, either.

964
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,480
Your ability to recover has also become superhuman.

965
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,020
You're right.

966
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,320
The scars I got from the zombies are all gone.

967
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,300
Oh my god.

968
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,700
Because I got infected with the virus...

969
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,380
She's insane!

970
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,020
Not only you mentioned it, all the scratches from earlier have completely healed!

971
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,300
This is all because I was infected with the virus?

972
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,800
To be precise, the virus gives you unlimited ammo.

973
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,720
The virus gives you unlimited ammo.

974
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:16,920
The virus gives you unlimited ammo.

975
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,880
That's what I should say.

976
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:26,080
Well, to be technical, it's because you've been spared from the negative effects of the virus using that special antibody inside of you.

977
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,940
However, it's only because I recovered so quickly that I've become stronger.

978
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,600
If I get cut off, I won't be able to return to normal.

979
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,080
So please be careful.

980
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:39,520
But please remember, all your body is doing is healing faster.

981
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,580
Regrowing limbs is impossible even at your current state.

982
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,840
So please be careful.

983
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,020
Aw man, I thought I was a lizard.

984
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,740
You're too scary, Kano-chan!

985
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,620
Please make me feel at ease!

986
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:52,720
Please make me feel at ease!

987
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,580
You have my current state?

988
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:55,960
What the heck?

989
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,760
I don't want to think about that!

990
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,060
How about you try and be a bit more comforting?

991
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,720
If I don't get surrounded by zombies, I can do something.

992
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,460
Please look around.

993
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,360
Sorry for the blip.

994
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,040
Obvious.

995
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,980
If you were entering a sporting competition, you would win gold because everyone else is dead.

996
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:18,360
Maybe the virus is a way to find super soldiers for the evil organization behind this.

997
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,720
You have a point there.

998
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,220
You'll be fine as long as those zombies don't completely surround you.

999
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,540
Please always watch your back and make sure you have an escape rope.

1000
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,040
Like I said earlier, Nagisa-san is a valuable sample.

1001
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,380
If I lose you, I won't be able to develop a vaccine.

1002
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,020
Go face when you'll never be a lizard, babe.

1003
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,840
My dreams are crushed.

1004
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,240
I told you before, but you're one in a million sample.

1005
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,260
If we lose you, we may never be able to make a vaccine to counter this.

1006
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:50,840
Okay.

1007
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,900
The maid cafe has maintained its function as a base.

1008
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:59,020
Of course, we have to speed up, but we can also maintain and strengthen our equipment.

1009
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,320
I've fully equipped the maid cafe to function as a base.

1010
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,420
Resting up is a given.

1011
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:09,060
But you can also maintain and strengthen your weaponry here, too.

1012
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:09,780
Maintain and strengthen your equipment?

1013
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,960
Strengthening my weapons?

1014
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:21,300
The weapon I gave you was designed to be used against regular humans.

1015
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:28,560
I've given you enough power as it is, but you'll need to strengthen it to effectively destroy the zombies.

1016
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,580
Oh, god, the zombies are gonna keep evolving, too.

1017
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,120
Well, it's pretty powerful as it- as is.

1018
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,640
We'll need to keep upgrading it to defeat the zombies.

1019
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:44,460
I hope- my hope for this game is that there's like an endless mode or something, you know?

1020
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,320
Of the gameplay.

1021
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,600
You know what, maybe I should just play Vampire Survivor.

1022
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,320
Even though I've never played it before.

1023
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,300
There is?

1024
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:58,680
Let's go.

1025
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,860
Hey, Kanon-chan.

1026
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,580
The zombies used to be normal people, right?

1027
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,420
Uh-oh, uh-oh, Nagisa's thinking too hard.

1028
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,980
These zombies used to be normal people, right?

1029
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,420
Uh-oh, don't think about it!

1030
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,080
Nagisa, don't think about it!

1031
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:16,860
Uh...

1032
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:20,080
Well, yes.

1033
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,720
Turn off the burn!

1034
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,080
It just makes me a bit uneasy to think about killing someone like that.

1035
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:32,760
Holocure!

1036
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,660
I've never played Holocure, either.

1037
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,780
But I've seen some funny people, like, really enjoying it.

1038
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:41,880
So maybe I'll play that, too.

1039
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,140
Actually, that's a lie.

1040
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,920
I have played it, like, once, I think.

1041
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:52,560
It's a lie.

1042
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,600
Play as Takanashi Kiara.

1043
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,420
Kay is goaded.

1044
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,460
That guy.

1045
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:04,920
He's crazy.

1046
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,340
Happy I could catch a livestream.

1047
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,320
Thank you!

1048
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,120
Hmm...

1049
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,680
I mean, they could be my friends or former co-workers, you know?

1050
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,540
Uh-oh.

1051
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,380
A weak mindset like that is going to get you killed.

1052
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,320
Hanya was your oshi?

1053
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,720
Hanya's my oshi, too.

1054
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,000
You can have more than one oshi.

1055
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,900
Hanya's my kami oshi.

1056
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,000
It's different.

1057
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,840
.

1058
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,680
She has rookie eyes...

1059
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:39,740
She has rookie eyes...

1060
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,800
She has rookie eyes...

1061
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:47,260
Yeah.

1062
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,780
.

1063
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,720
.

1064
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,080
Their brains have been invaded and destroyed.

1065
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,980
The only thing remaining is their will to attack humans.

1066
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,620
Yeah, I'm fine if I become infected?

1067
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:17,440
It doesn't mean that it won't happen forever.

1068
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,900
I've been bitten many times.

1069
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,540
Maybe one day...

1070
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,340
Also,

1071
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,300
she is really brave.

1072
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,280
Just standing in the street.

1073
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:40,140
I was gifted a sub?

1074
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:40,920
Welcome!

1075
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,600
Besides, I doubt you want to try this.

1076
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:47,500
You want to try getting minced by zombie teeth to test out that theory, correct?

1077
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,980
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

1078
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,240
Minto my kamiyoshi!

1079
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,020
Thank you!

1080
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,520
Thank you so much!

1081
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,200
For real?

1082
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:02,640
Really?

1083
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,540
You mean that?

1084
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,880
Miss Nagisa, may I remind you...

1085
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,800
You can't completely save a zombie.

1086
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,000
Even if the vaccine is completed, it's impossible.

1087
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,760
Those that have fully transformed won't be able to be saved.

1088
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,100
It's impossible, no matter how good the vaccine may end up being.

1089
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,400
Oh my gosh, we're gonna have to cut off Rinka's arm.

1090
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,300
I am a human-shaped something.

1091
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,120
Don't hesitate to shoot for Nagisa-san's sake.

1092
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,000
They're just human-shaped, that's all.

1093
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,180
Please don't hold back on shooting them.

1094
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,440
For your sake as well.

1095
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,260
Even if that means you're an important person.

1096
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,980
If we were bitten by mint, what would we become?

1097
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,080
I don't think you'd become a ghost.

1098
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,800
I can scratch you guys!

1099
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,360
I could scratch your backs.

1100
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,660
Sometimes people don't like that though.

1101
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,640
They're just like, I was scratched by a ghost!

1102
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,000
And it left a mark on my back.

1103
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,520
Happens all the time in those ghost shows.

1104
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,840
All I'm trying to do is...

1105
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,160
You scratch my back, I scratch yours!

1106
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,940
No matter who you may end up facing.

1107
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,620
I got it.

1108
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,280
You can now purchase...

1109
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:27,900
...METAL!

1110
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,840
Oh my gosh, this is so cute!

1111
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,500
This base is a safe zone.

1112
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,280
You can prepare for battle here.

1113
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,300
You can set your deployment units along with location.

1114
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,360
You can purchase items...

1115
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,480
Oh my gosh, there's so much going on.

1116
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,940
Mint bite equals brain freeze.

1117
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,540
Purchase items and power them up here.

1118
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,060
Treatment...

1119
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,800
You can treat any zombified maids.

1120
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,840
You want your scratches to turn people into maids?

1121
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,220
Do you want to become a maid?

1122
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,220
Maid world takeover.

1123
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,800
You can treat any zombified maids.

1124
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,040
Select the maid that you want to treat after choosing this option.

1125
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,400
Sub-stories...

1126
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,000
Unlocked when certain conditions are met.

1127
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,280
Save load...

1128
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,200
Auto-saving the gate auto-saves after battle or any events.

1129
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,720
These saves cannot be overwritten, but you may load from previous saves.

1130
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,460
By pressing Y, we'll make a cursor appear which we can use to...

1131
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,020
T-t-t-t-touch the maid!

1132
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,100
Wait...

1133
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:40,960
It's...

1134
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,560
It's not Y on the keyboard.

1135
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,760
What is it?

1136
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:45,900
Oh, uh...

1137
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,500
Touch Q.

1138
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,340
Show

1139
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:15,620
me what is it.

1140
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,420
Show me what is it.

1141
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,840
Maid old chae is so cute.

1142
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:33,100
Nade nade.

1143
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,120
Nade nade.

1144
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,120
Nade nade.

1145
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,500
So cute!

1146
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:38,940
You do it.

1147
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:43,120
Somebody just do something.

1148
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,220
Watchingaxascalhooo......

1149
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,440
See what we get.

1150
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:49,900
That's for the treasure!

1151
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,100
How did you know that's error?

1152
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,240
But I didn't do the magic.

1153
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:54,900
That's the end of the qual lightning that we didn't come here for to treat Qu affiliates.

1154
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,300
It's me.

1155
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:56,980
And there all of my P.A's...

1156
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,900
To save your poison like WB 색k проблем.

1157
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,720
Let's save our poison.

1158
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,140
For thisچ

1159
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,860
There's nothing to kill.

1160
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:07,320
You're jadi, right?

1161
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:07,760
See now.

1162
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,660
Oh my gosh.

1163
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:12,000
Some materials are able to be purchased, others can only be obtained through combat.

1164
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,700
Holy cow!

1165
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,300
Head pat the bottom right man.

1166
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,100
No!

1167
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,690
An opai lap pat?

1168
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:31,590
Selection of items will be limited early on, but will increase based on number of areas cleared.

1169
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,290
Additionally, some items will only appear when certain maids are deployed.

1170
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:35,690
Oh...

1171
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:36,610
Ninka!

1172
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:37,610
This is spoilers!

1173
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:38,770
Is it not?

1174
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,450
Disposables can be selected to take into battle.

1175
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:43,810
Disposable?

1176
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,950
She's not disposable?

1177
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:46,110
Ninka!

1178
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:50,250
The effects of an item will last throughout the battle, but will disappear when returning to base.

1179
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:53,110
Only bring one disposable.

1180
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,210
Accessories are compatible with any maid of your choice.

1181
00:58:57,270 --> 00:59:00,870
Consider which accessories should be equipped with which maid depending on the situation.

1182
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,190
Gosh, there is so much to this game!

1183
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,450
We can get metal!

1184
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:08,930
Let's buy one metal.

1185
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,700
I don't know what it'll do.

1186
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,800
The apocalypse doesn't look bad at all!

1187
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,440
Powering up equipment will strengthen each maid.

1188
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:32,120
Accessories, maid clothes, close range weapons, and shooting weapons need the right materials to power up.

1189
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,000
Is she also in the title screen?

1190
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,460
Oh yeah, how did I... Oh, it was right button for close combat stuff.

1191
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:45,520
CQC.

1192
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,580
Shooting weapons grant different bonuses based on the equipped maid.

1193
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,680
Select a maid and choose a stat you want to increase.

1194
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,840
By doing this, you can check what statuses can be increased.

1195
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,580
Holy cow, this is so...

1196
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,800
The results will be displayed during confirmation.

1197
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:07,120
Whilst you need all required materials to power up items, if those missing materials are purchasable, the purchase can be made on the spot to provide...

1198
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,300
Oh, proceed with powering up.

1199
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,000
Each maid brings a unique sniper rifle.

1200
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,180
Strength to the team.

1201
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,880
Make sure to not only...

1202
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,600
To not focus solely on increasing the strength of one, but to train a handful equally to counter any situation.

1203
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,460
Accessories are the one selection that can be changed during deployment by choosing change accessory.

1204
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,280
Choose the accessory you want to switch to from the accessory list.

1205
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:33,860
Accessories cannot be powered up unless equipped.

1206
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,600
Power up results and also enhance skills used in battle.

1207
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,000
So what else can we get?

1208
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:42,860
Combat knife?

1209
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,280
Oh, one metal!

1210
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:49,020
Wait, what about our rifle though?

1211
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,600
Oh, let's do the metal... er, the rifle.

1212
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:55,260
What's our accessory?

1213
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,980
Sometimes I wonder if Mint is actually the ghost of an old man.

1214
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,120
What?

1215
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:03,740
No...

1216
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,400
What's my inventory?

1217
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,760
Bullets and metal.

1218
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,740
Wait, a special bullet that can be used to befriend zombies?

1219
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,920
Only works on maid-like zombies.

1220
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,180
How convenient.

1221
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,800
Wait, hold on.

1222
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,340
Can I upgrade my weapon again?

1223
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,240
Oh, I don't have enough money.

1224
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:26,980
Okay.

1225
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:28,640
Oh, my bad.

1226
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,200
Let's go strike!

1227
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:36,400
Strike!

1228
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:36,620
Strike!

1229
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,020
Strike!

1230
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,400
Strike!

1231
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:40,820
Strike!

1232
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:41,800
Strike!

1233
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,760
Strike!

1234
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,360
Strike!

1235
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,680
Strike!

1236
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,940
Strike!

1237
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:51,220
Strike at the right time!

1238
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,080
Yeah!

1239
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,540
Hit him!

1240
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,020
Knock him down now!

1241
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,040
prisons are answered!

1242
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,980
You can select your deployed units along with the location.

1243
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,780
When selecting a location, you must select an area first, then choose a stage.

1244
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,460
The condition needed to clear the stage will be displayed.

1245
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,360
Take note that each stage has different conditions.

1246
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,640
Playable characters are limited to maids that can be deployed.

1247
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,560
You cannot deploy any zombified maids.

1248
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,220
Each maid has different weapons that they are able to equip.

1249
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,700
Additionally, they all have distinct skills and special skills.

1250
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,100
You may bring one disposable stage.

1251
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,700
What is the disposable?

1252
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:38,760
Okay.

1253
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:40,140
Red breath.

1254
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:42,120
What does that mean?

1255
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:45,800
Let's go.

1256
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:51,850
Assist bullets.

1257
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:54,050
You can fire bullets by holding down RT.

1258
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:58,050
You can recruit any maids zombies from across enemy lines by shooting...

1259
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,290
Oh my gosh!

1260
01:02:59,450 --> 01:02:59,970
Wait, any?

1261
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:01,510
Wait, RT.

1262
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:03,390
Uh-oh.

1263
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:03,710
Wait.

1264
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:08,510
Maybe I should be playing this with a controller.

1265
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:09,810
Wait, now I'm not sure at all.

1266
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:14,910
These tutorials are super long-winded.

1267
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:19,550
But what do I hold down?

1268
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:37,350
Now I'm using my controller.

1269
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:38,670
Wait, now I don't know how to do anything.

1270
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:41,410
Wait.

1271
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:43,550
I think...

1272
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:44,170
Wait.

1273
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:44,690
Uh-oh.

1274
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:46,790
Wait.

1275
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:47,910
Uh-oh.

1276
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:52,030
Check the control map?

1277
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:52,450
Yeah.

1278
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,690
So B or RT.

1279
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:58,590
These will not work on giant zombies.

1280
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:06,010
Assist bullets pierce through the enemy other than maids zombies and will hit any enemy within range.

1281
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:08,770
Amount of bullets that can be brought into battle are limited.

1282
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:11,510
Purchasing new bullets will replenish any used prior.

1283
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:12,330
Okay.

1284
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:12,590
Okay.

1285
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:12,850
Okay.

1286
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,910
Oh, and then they come and join.

1287
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,810
If they take too much damage, they will retreat.

1288
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:19,030
Oh, that's so cute!

1289
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,690
You can have multiple allied mazes.

1290
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:22,290
9 maximum.

1291
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:26,250
Recruiting more mazes will result in more potential strategies in battle and strengthen your army.

1292
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:29,410
Wait, I'm actually making a maid army?

1293
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:31,730
MSF.

1294
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:32,990
Maid sounds frontiers.

1295
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:34,370
Hope you're having a fun stream!

1296
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:36,350
It was my birthday yesterday, so can I...

1297
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:38,950
Now justify my hip hurting sometimes.

1298
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:42,090
I'm getting dizzy when I get up too fast.

1299
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:43,550
It's normal for 20- Oh my god, baby.

1300
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:45,630
I don't know about you.

1301
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,410
I'm feeling 22.

1302
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,850
But yeah, as...

1303
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:54,430
Oh, someone else said you should probably go see a doctor.

1304
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:55,810
Happy birthday!

1305
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:00,350
Okay, why is the unique skill...

1306
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:03,650
Special skill gauge...

1307
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,330
Okay, I see it.

1308
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:06,170
Alright.

1309
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:07,790
Alright, alright.

1310
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,140
Oh wait, I kinda... Oh gosh, I kinda hate...

1311
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,220
Oh god, the aiming on the controller is awful!

1312
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,600
Oh god!

1313
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,540
Oh god, okay, wait.

1314
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,240
Okay, I'm gonna use...

1315
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,260
Oh no, I can't do both.

1316
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,300
I can't... Oh god, oh god.

1317
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,500
It's so bad.

1318
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:30,980
Okay, you know what?

1319
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,120
Back to...

1320
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:43,730
I'm gonna have to check the... What's it called?

1321
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:51,170
Magnetic field?

1322
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:52,850
Oh wait.

1323
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:52,990
Nice!

1324
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:55,230
Lightning drone!

1325
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,940
Trying to collect more hearts.

1326
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,540
Combat drone... Oh no, the speed!

1327
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:11,580
Okay, next time we'll... Next time we get speed, you guys.

1328
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:12,700
We're gonna get more speed.

1329
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,200
Where's some...

1330
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:17,620
Where's some...

1331
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,840
Some little maids?

1332
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:21,740
Okay, hold on.

1333
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,300
Let's do options.

1334
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,040
And...

1335
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,120
Well...

1336
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,720
I guess we'll just figure it out.

1337
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,380
I guess we'll just figure it out.

1338
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:52,410
Interface spoilers.

1339
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:55,130
Nah, I'm not... I wasn't even looking.

1340
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:56,550
Don't worry.

1341
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:00,310
Oh my god, there's so many here.

1342
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:07,630
More drones!

1343
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:08,410
Oh.

1344
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:10,750
Optimize is pretty good too, though.

1345
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:12,510
Probably should grab that.

1346
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:15,110
I don't know how many...

1347
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:19,290
Actually, how many skills I can get, you know?

1348
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:21,610
Oh, there's so much over here.

1349
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:23,410
Come on, guys.

1350
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,130
Let's blow them up.

1351
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:25,910
Let's blow them up.

1352
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:30,050
There's so much hearts here!

1353
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,120
Maid?

1354
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:37,560
Oh!

1355
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:38,460
Wait!

1356
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,380
You guys, I learned what my...

1357
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,560
How to do my special attack.

1358
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,800
I learned how to do my special attack.

1359
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,050
We got another drone!

1360
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,470
Oh, man.

1361
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:18,530
Oh, wait.

1362
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:18,830
What's this?

1363
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,070
I'm so... Okay.

1364
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:25,130
But then what could...

1365
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:27,270
Oh!

1366
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:32,320
Sensor?

1367
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,060
Let's try it.

1368
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,120
Is this like it pulls items closer to me?

1369
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,920
Or like I can collect items more easily, you know?

1370
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:45,390
What could it be?

1371
01:08:45,610 --> 01:08:46,310
Okay, so...

1372
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:49,910
Maybe like Z or X will be it.

1373
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:51,250
I'll try...

1374
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:54,130
I'll try Z or X next time we see a maid.

1375
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:56,850
Maid!

1376
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:57,830
Okay, okay.

1377
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:58,790
Okay, okay, okay.

1378
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:00,890
More drone.

1379
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:02,090
Okay, hold on.

1380
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:02,530
Hold on.

1381
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:03,570
No, don't shoot her!

1382
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:03,890
Don't shoot!

1383
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:04,710
Don't shoot!

1384
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:05,130
Don't shoot!

1385
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,180
My drones!

1386
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,320
Drones!

1387
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,340
What are you doing?

1388
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:14,600
No!

1389
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:15,420
Okay, here.

1390
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,480
She's mine!

1391
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:20,460
Z...

1392
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,080
Oh!

1393
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:21,920
She's dead.

1394
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:22,520
Wait.

1395
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:23,940
Z or X does not work.

1396
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:24,680
No!

1397
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,060
Stop killing her!

1398
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:32,080
I need to practice on her!

1399
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,140
I need to practice on her!

1400
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:34,480
Um...

1401
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,200
E or R?

1402
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:41,920
E!

1403
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:42,420
Oh!

1404
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,160
I didn't get to...

1405
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,120
I didn't get to press it.

1406
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,300
I didn't get to press it.

1407
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:52,880
Hello!

1408
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,100
Try right click?

1409
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,840
That's what did my special attack.

1410
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,040
That's what did my special attack.

1411
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,140
It was Z or X for me.

1412
01:09:59,200 --> 01:09:59,740
But you have to hold...

1413
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:00,020
Oh!

1414
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,180
Hold it down for several seconds.

1415
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:01,620
Okay, okay.

1416
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,500
Okay, I see her!

1417
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:02,860
I see her!

1418
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:03,180
I see her!

1419
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:03,420
I see her!

1420
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:04,540
Z!

1421
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:07,180
Z!

1422
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:07,900
X!

1423
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:09,460
There it is!

1424
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:10,560
Oh!

1425
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:11,540
Uh...

1426
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:12,660
Oh...

1427
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:13,460
It

1428
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,880
went just straight past her.

1429
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,760
Was that a big maid?

1430
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:22,940
That counted as a big maid?

1431
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:23,600
Oh.

1432
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,900
Let's just keep increasing their strength.

1433
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:39,220
Wait.

1434
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,800
They're gonna kill all the maids.

1435
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,580
She was big.

1436
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:46,140
Oh!

1437
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,040
I'll take whatever that is.

1438
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:51,600
Let's see.

1439
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,440
More drone!

1440
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:53,480
Oh!

1441
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:58,760
Oh!

1442
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,620
My drones are everywhere.

1443
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,160
They're circling me everywhere.

1444
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,500
It's a lot of drones.

1445
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,100
Yeah, you know.

1446
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:14,630
We just got to survive, right?

1447
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:15,590
For five minutes?

1448
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:17,190
We're so slow.

1449
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:18,210
Please give us speed.

1450
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:20,750
Please give us a speed power-up.

1451
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:22,530
I need a maid.

1452
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:26,750
Okay, so I think it was X actually that it worked on.

1453
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:28,590
So, as soon as I get to her, I can stays in here.

1454
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:29,370
I see a girlie.

1455
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:32,850
Look at all these convenience workers.

1456
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:33,610
It's so sad.

1457
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:37,850
Speed?

1458
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:42,450
Magnetic field.

1459
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:43,590
That sounds fun.

1460
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:47,990
More toilet paper.

1461
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:53,430
You're going to need toilet paper if you want to survive the apocalypse, you know?

1462
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:57,630
I know my special bullets limited.

1463
01:11:58,590 --> 01:11:59,630
And I wasted it.

1464
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:01,550
I didn't realize she was a big maid.

1465
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:17,650
I want to just be faster.

1466
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:20,030
I know we're in like the early stages and everything.

1467
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:33,700
S rank.

1468
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:40,420
Anton!

1469
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,340
Hi dog.

1470
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,300
I can now purchase Titan silver.

1471
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,660
And fi... fiber!

1472
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,520
Fiber wiper!

1473
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,760
Got a final tomorrow.

1474
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:57,260
Can't stay.

1475
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:57,700
Sorry.

1476
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,580
No worries.

1477
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,060
Good luck!

1478
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,860
What's the clear conditions on this one?

1479
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,280
Defeat all enemies.

1480
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,540
We can do that.

1481
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,260
Easy peasy.

1482
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:10,540
Strike.

1483
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:12,960
Let's just go.

1484
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,600
We can do that easy.

1485
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,180
Pause.

1486
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:19,680
Yeah.

1487
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,640
During a pause menu, you can switch between two screens.

1488
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:23,120
Status.

1489
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:24,540
Radar for in-range weapons.

1490
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,520
Oh, look at that!

1491
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:28,240
It tells you everything.

1492
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,980
You can watch the events after a battle.

1493
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,480
We need to level up.

1494
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:33,560
We need to power up.

1495
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,100
Power up.

1496
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,360
Temporary invisibility.

1497
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,380
Vaccine materials for bullets!

1498
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:38,860
Oh!

1499
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:40,940
Distribute points after battle.

1500
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:44,280
Flamethrower!

1501
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:48,900
Change the... yeah, yeah, yeah.

1502
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:53,080
Gotta defeat all the enemies.

1503
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:53,980
Oh, look at these guys.

1504
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:57,900
Nice.

1505
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,140
Let's do... let's do the magnetic field again.

1506
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:18,280
Hey, give me more hearts.

1507
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,420
Give me more hearts.

1508
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:21,340
Maid!

1509
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,500
We can actually get her on our side, maybe.

1510
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:26,640
Speed!

1511
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:29,480
Oh, uh-oh.

1512
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:29,920
Uh-oh.

1513
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:30,760
Uh-oh, I'm in trouble.

1514
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:31,480
Ah, let's see.

1515
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:31,940
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1516
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,980
I took some damage, but that's okay.

1517
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,420
She's on our side!

1518
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:40,140
Yippee!

1519
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,300
We have a maid now.

1520
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,600
How many enemies are there?

1521
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,520
Oh, she's attacking?

1522
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:47,920
She's...

1523
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:49,280
Oh, god.

1524
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:49,940
Uh...

1525
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:50,980
Uh...

1526
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:51,540
Ah!

1527
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:51,580
Ah!

1528
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,410
I wish I had a drone.

1529
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:00,490
Oh, perfect timing.

1530
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:07,960
Welcome to the army.

1531
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,340
Welcome to the maid army.

1532
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:14,480
Nice.

1533
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:16,600
More drone!

1534
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1535
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,300
I don't know what's going on.

1536
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,820
More drone!

1537
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,940
Increase the strength on my thing.

1538
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,080
Oh, okay, okay.

1539
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:32,540
Ah!

1540
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:34,440
Oh, well.

1541
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,240
Well, uh...

1542
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,360
Oh my gosh, maid girls!

1543
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:36,780
Be careful!

1544
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:37,220
Be careful!

1545
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,240
I'm clearing a path!

1546
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,020
I'm clearing a path!

1547
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,280
They follow, which is pretty cute.

1548
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,140
Oh, is my stream buffering?

1549
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,730
Ah, no!

1550
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:03,930
I wasted my follow!

1551
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:06,430
Is my stream buffering?

1552
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:07,250
Oh, all good?

1553
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:07,670
Okay.

1554
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:13,550
Sorry if there's some weird...

1555
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:14,450
It's fine.

1556
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:16,850
Sorry if there's some weird YouTube stuff going on.

1557
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:17,130
I don't know.

1558
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:20,550
Auto heals.

1559
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:22,370
Sounds kinda nice.

1560
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:25,370
I wonder how it auto heals.

1561
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:26,230
Let's try it.

1562
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:29,710
We should probably start experimenting with more things, you know?

1563
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:30,390
Oh, gosh.

1564
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:31,890
Ah!

1565
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:36,950
There you go, everybody.

1566
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:39,550
Oh, vaccine!

1567
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:39,710
Vaccine!

1568
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,080
This one.

1569
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:49,780
Nice.

1570
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:50,980
Nice!

1571
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:52,300
Nice!

1572
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:52,820
Nice!

1573
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:55,300
I still don't know how to slash.

1574
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:59,180
I still don't know how to do the close range combat.

1575
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,760
I can get all up in the zombies' faces and deal damage to them, so don't worry about distance.

1576
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:07,100
Yeah, I know.

1577
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,020
I know that's what it does.

1578
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,180
I know that's what it does.

1579
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:11,420
What does it mean?

1580
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,460
Mod?

1581
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:13,060
What the hell?

1582
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,060
Middle click?

1583
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,280
Oh, let me try middle click.

1584
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,480
Let's see.

1585
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,380
Magnetic field 4?

1586
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,360
Oh, it increases the range.

1587
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,120
Or one word, road.

1588
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,400
Let's increase the range.

1589
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:40,420
No, middle click isn't doing anything.

1590
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:44,250
Oh, that's a big girl.

1591
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,210
That's a big girl.

1592
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:47,930
Oh!

1593
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,360
How could Mint forget the basics of CQC?

1594
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:03,740
I'm honestly...

1595
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,700
How am I supposed to defeat all of these?

1596
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:11,160
Yes!

1597
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:13,900
More drones.

1598
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,420
I wish I could get more mates as well.

1599
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,460
We're close to being...

1600
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:22,320
We're close to being able to use our attack, our special.

1601
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,720
Just use our special.

1602
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:30,380
There it is.

1603
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:31,300
Hold on!

1604
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,860
There's more falling from the sky.

1605
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:39,280
Somebody dropped their toilet paper.

1606
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,340
More drones.

1607
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,280
More movement.

1608
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:51,060
Oh my god.

1609
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:51,440
Speed.

1610
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:52,700
Thank god.

1611
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:55,180
Forty percent?

1612
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,340
Hell yeah.

1613
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:03,020
Okay.

1614
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:03,560
All right.

1615
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,940
They're starting to dwindle a little bit.

1616
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,260
We're doing well.

1617
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:06,880
We're doing well.

1618
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,160
Max.

1619
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,400
Let's just max this guy out, you know.

1620
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:12,240
Oh, the otaku!

1621
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:12,340
Oh!

1622
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:18,520
You were like a death ball.

1623
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,220
I know.

1624
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:19,980
It's awesome, right?

1625
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:26,530
How many more guys are there?

1626
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:29,750
I say...

1627
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,130
More drones!

1628
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:34,250
Ah!

1629
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:38,350
Yeah!

1630
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:40,830
Hello, drones.

1631
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,210
More mates!

1632
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:45,510
I haven't seen any other girl...

1633
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:46,550
Any other mate girls.

1634
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:47,610
Oh!

1635
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:48,370
Oh!

1636
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:49,150
Oh!

1637
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:51,270
Oh!

1638
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:52,630
I haven't seen any.

1639
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,950
We haven't tried the grenades.

1640
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:58,370
Let's try stuff like this, you know.

1641
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:00,250
We haven't tried anything like this.

1642
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:02,690
Do I just throw them out?

1643
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:03,410
Oh, I throw them out.

1644
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:03,670
Okay.

1645
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:04,750
Perfect.

1646
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:07,470
I don't have to, like, select it or anything.

1647
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:07,750
Cool.

1648
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:08,910
Oh!

1649
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:09,230
Oh!

1650
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,230
Watch out for the fire.

1651
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:14,830
Oh my god.

1652
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:15,950
I am so powerful.

1653
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:16,530
Look at this.

1654
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:21,810
Increases drones.

1655
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:23,050
Oh!

1656
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:23,190
Oh!

1657
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:23,570
Oh my god.

1658
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:26,430
Oh, thank god.

1659
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:27,810
I'm a little ball of death, right?

1660
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:31,910
They ambushed me like that.

1661
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:34,710
Oh, my health did heal.

1662
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:35,410
That's so awesome.

1663
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:39,010
Your own fire is probably safe.

1664
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:40,110
I guess we'll see.

1665
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:42,390
Land mine.

1666
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:43,150
Plant a bomb on...

1667
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:45,680
You know what?

1668
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:46,240
Let's try it.

1669
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:50,580
We have still quite a few amount of skill points.

1670
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:51,960
Let's go test my fire.

1671
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:53,240
Oh!

1672
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:53,660
Okay.

1673
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:54,040
It's gone.

1674
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,000
Really?

1675
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,140
Oh!

1676
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,120
Oh, this is the bomb.

1677
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:06,640
I'm planting bombs.

1678
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:07,240
I'm planting bombs.

1679
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:10,760
Get her.

1680
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:11,120
Get her.

1681
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:11,560
Get her.

1682
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:12,740
Get her.

1683
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:22,940
No damage.

1684
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:23,300
Yeah.

1685
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:23,800
Nice.

1686
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,300
Drone maids.

1687
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:26,400
Yes.

1688
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:27,320
Yippee!

1689
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,100
More speed.

1690
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,040
Okay.

1691
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:33,900
How are you doing, my little maids?

1692
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,040
Oh, my god.

1693
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:36,080
Oooooooh!

1694
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:37,360
Don't get hurt.

1695
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:37,880
Don't get hurt.

1696
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:39,460
Ahh!

1697
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:41,940
Oh, my god.

1698
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:42,280
Oh, my god.

1699
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:43,620
Oh, I don't have my skill.

1700
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,600
Oh, my god.

1701
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:45,280
Oh, my god.

1702
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:45,680
Oh, my god.

1703
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:46,780
Oh, my god.

1704
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,720
My skill is not...

1705
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:49,660
Let's see.

1706
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:50,480
Uhm...

1707
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,160
More drone strength.

1708
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:02,050
Luckily, the land mines like kind of...

1709
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:03,230
Oh, my god.

1710
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:04,730
The maids like kind of get in my way.

1711
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:05,330
I'm not gonna lie.

1712
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:05,550
Okay.

1713
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:07,310
They make it... they like push me.

1714
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:09,170
I have to like push through them, you know?

1715
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:13,490
Don't let the maids die.

1716
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:17,270
Oh, more drones!

1717
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:18,750
Perfect.

1718
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:19,750
Perfection.

1719
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:23,950
I know what can solve any horrible situation.

1720
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:26,130
Oh my god, stop landing on me!

1721
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,170
I don't know what my HP is at.

1722
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,430
But it does heal by itself.

1723
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:31,590
Oh my gosh, little maids.

1724
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:32,270
I need you to move.

1725
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:33,090
Maids.

1726
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:33,890
Maids, please.

1727
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:44,170
I want the toilet paper.

1728
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,300
Oh no!

1729
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,880
Oh no, we lost one.

1730
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,220
We lost a maid.

1731
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,600
Your maid army is to die for.

1732
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,920
We lost a maid, you guys.

1733
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,240
Probably should do my...

1734
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,200
Holy cow!

1735
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,760
Holy cow.

1736
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,000
Yippee!

1737
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:21,600
She went out as a human.

1738
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:22,960
So true.

1739
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:24,340
It's not that they run away.

1740
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:25,160
I think she's alright.

1741
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,740
You can't convert the big maids?

1742
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:32,620
No, you can't.

1743
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,700
Only the small maids.

1744
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,420
That one was fine.

1745
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:41,200
Let's see what we can upgrade now.

1746
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:48,490
Or rather, can we buy anything?

1747
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:51,530
What can we buy?

1748
01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:51,650
Why?

1749
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:54,050
Bullet.

1750
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:55,430
Oh yeah, this is the special.

1751
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:57,230
Oh, we only have one left, so...

1752
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:58,370
Oh, they're cheap.

1753
01:23:58,490 --> 01:23:59,030
They're really cheap.

1754
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:00,810
Oh, I can only buy two.

1755
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:01,210
Okay.

1756
01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:04,810
I need...

1757
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,350
vaccines to make the bullets.

1758
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:08,550
Okay, understandable, understandable.

1759
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:09,150
Okay.

1760
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:10,390
I have four of those.

1761
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:10,810
No.

1762
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:14,230
Five, six...

1763
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:15,450
Okay.

1764
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:17,790
Let's upgrade some stuff.

1765
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:19,450
Let's upgrade our rifle.

1766
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:22,370
Yes.

1767
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:25,010
Nice.

1768
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,470
What about my maid outfit?

1769
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:32,010
Oh, fiber.

1770
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,470
Upgrade.

1771
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:37,150
How much money do I have?

1772
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:38,250
Where is my money?

1773
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:41,550
Anyway, let's just spend it all.

1774
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:43,650
I don't know where my money is.

1775
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:47,170
Fiber wiper.

1776
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:48,590
Fiber wiper.

1777
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:51,730
My speed went up?

1778
01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:52,510
No way.

1779
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:54,310
Oh, it does.

1780
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:55,770
It increases your defense speed and HP.

1781
01:24:58,190 --> 01:24:59,150
Let's do it again, then.

1782
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:02,250
Where's my money?

1783
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:03,730
How much money do I have?

1784
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:07,410
Six thousand...

1785
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:08,790
Wait, how do you guys see it?

1786
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:10,570
Oh, I see.

1787
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:11,870
MP is possession.

1788
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:17,190
I see.

1789
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:17,750
MP is possession.

1790
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:19,070
I see.

1791
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:20,510
I see.

1792
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:21,510
I see.

1793
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:22,610
We are gonna be so strong.

1794
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:28,570
I would upgrade my combat knife more, but like, I don't know how to use it, so...

1795
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:31,030
Producer's sign?

1796
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:31,610
Pretty much.

1797
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:33,510
Okay, that should be good.

1798
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:34,930
I think for now.

1799
01:25:36,830 --> 01:25:37,850
What's the clear conditions?

1800
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:42,870
Defeat the boss!

1801
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:46,690
Don't forget to save.

1802
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:48,510
Oh, it auto-saves, though, right?

1803
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:51,270
If you don't look at your money, it's like you're not spending it.

1804
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,490
Oh, I see.

1805
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:52,450
I do that all the time.

1806
01:25:57,710 --> 01:26:02,180
All right, let's go try.

1807
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:04,660
Striker!

1808
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:09,300
Yeah, it auto-saves.

1809
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:09,520
Oh!

1810
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:19,220
Have you found any signs of Ms. Rinka's whereabouts?

1811
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:19,680
No.

1812
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,980
I still haven't found anything.

1813
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,360
To be honest, I haven't found anything.

1814
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:24,080
What are we gonna do, then?

1815
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:26,360
No, not yet.

1816
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,060
I don't even know where I should be looking.

1817
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:32,580
Yeah.

1818
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,020
I thought so.

1819
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:42,040
Akihabara isn't really that big, but searching while having to fight off zombies is no easy task.

1820
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:43,540
I mean, I've been like in the same street.

1821
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,100
An impostor of the boss.

1822
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:57,040
No matter where I find her, I've made up my mind that I'll be the one to save her.

1823
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,540
Her radar is going off.

1824
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,660
I can't help but find it a bit strange.

1825
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,980
Why are you so dead set on finding Miss Rinka?

1826
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:23,440
You think it's weird?

1827
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,760
Isn't it normal to want to save a friend?

1828
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:35,560
Oh, sorry!

1829
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:36,340
Oh my gosh.

1830
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:37,080
Wait, where's the log?

1831
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,320
It'll mean risking your own life, though.

1832
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:48,240
I don't understand the logic of wanting to do that when she isn't even a family member.

1833
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:52,080
Are you saying you have to have some kind of reason before you can save her?

1834
01:27:58,540 --> 01:27:59,780
That's not it.

1835
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,920
I'm asking you if this reason of yours is worth putting your life on the line for.

1836
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:05,960
A reason to risk my life...

1837
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,060
A reason...

1838
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:13,200
I didn't really think about it, but maybe it's because we're friends.

1839
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:16,840
The reason I put myself in danger, huh?

1840
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:19,880
I mean, I didn't really think too much of it.

1841
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,240
Wait, think of it too much.

1842
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,160
But it's because she's my friend.

1843
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,060
That's not the answer.

1844
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:27,600
You didn't answer my question.

1845
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:28,780
But it's the truth!

1846
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:29,740
Friend...

1847
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:31,900
I'm not lying, though!

1848
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,980
Rinka-chan is the same age as me, though.

1849
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:39,900
At the maid cafe after work, she was a bit older than me.

1850
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:44,560
Rinka is the same age as me, but she started working at the maid cafe before I did.

1851
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:46,260
This is the place she used to work at.

1852
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,100
Ah, that must be the cafe that we're using as a base right now.

1853
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:53,920
She's got them crazy eyes again.

1854
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:03,340
And on my first shift, she ended up being the one to teach me the ropes.

1855
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:17,730
I thought she was reserved and a little scary in the beginning.

1856
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:20,210
But she'd always come to my rescue when I missed her.

1857
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:33,790
We went to different universities, but we'd always hang out when we could.

1858
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:36,390
And before I realized it, we were always together.

1859
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,450
We went to different universities, but we'd always hang out when we could.

1860
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:37,570
And before I realized it, we were always together.

1861
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:40,670
So you're her best friend?

1862
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:44,190
A best friend of sorts.

1863
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:45,410
Is that it?

1864
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:47,450
Yeah, something like that.

1865
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:49,270
You could say that.

1866
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:53,250
Besides, Rinka saved me when the pandemic broke out.

1867
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:59,490
Rinka even saved me just as the pandemic was beginning.

1868
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:06,110
When we were setting up the maid cafe, the zombies suddenly started attacking us.

1869
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:10,730
When we were handing out flyers, some people that had turned into zombies started attacking us.

1870
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:13,650
I didn't know what was going on, so I couldn't move.

1871
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:16,270
John did a plot twist.

1872
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:17,050
Rinka changed me from a zombie.

1873
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:19,250
I was frozen in place.

1874
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,670
I was frozen in place with everything that was going on.

1875
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:22,810
But Rinka saved me from the zombies.

1876
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:25,350
I like the music in this game a lot.

1877
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:32,530
Hold on, I'm going to get a cough drop real quick.

1878
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:33,470
I have one.

1879
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:38,930
I got one.

1880
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:43,510
Give me one second to put it in.

1881
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:47,810
Thinking back, that must have been the moment that she was bitten and got infected by the virus.

1882
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:48,910
Please.

1883
01:30:49,870 --> 01:30:51,170
Very like-minded.

1884
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:57,450
What did you say?

1885
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:58,590
Did you say something?

1886
01:30:58,910 --> 01:30:59,170
No.

1887
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:02,150
More importantly, it's about Rinka-san's creation.

1888
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:05,590
It seems that the inside of that building is full of zombies.

1889
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:11,830
If we were in the UDX area, it's more like this direction.

1890
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:13,790
Behind you guys.

1891
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:14,390
Behind chat.

1892
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:16,050
It's nothing.

1893
01:31:16,450 --> 01:31:16,930
Anyway.

1894
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:18,710
In regards to searching for Ms. Rinka.

1895
01:31:18,930 --> 01:31:21,410
The building over there seems to be a gathering spot for the zombies.

1896
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:25,190
Nagisa-san isn't that far away from the place where she broke up with Ms. Rinka.

1897
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:27,990
There's a possibility that she might have been drawn to it.

1898
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:29,970
Yeah, it's really nice.

1899
01:31:31,210 --> 01:31:35,170
And then also, just like, all the soundtrack for this is really good.

1900
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:37,670
Like the rock parts too.

1901
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:44,230
They haven't left the area where you and Ms. Rinka split.

1902
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:46,850
Which means there might be some sort of clue around them.

1903
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:47,330
Really?

1904
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:50,470
Then I'll go take care of it right away!

1905
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:52,570
And I need to get a move on!

1906
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,730
Oh, indoor zombie.

1907
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:02,170
Please do your best to be careful.

1908
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:05,790
Battling zombies indoors is going to be much more of a challenge than usual.

1909
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:08,730
If you fight while being careful, you'll be fine.

1910
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:13,830
And when the time comes, Kanon-chan will help you, right?

1911
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:16,430
Well, make sure to be extra careful then.

1912
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:17,510
Don't worry about it.

1913
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:19,330
Plus, you'll save me if I need it, right?

1914
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:23,230
If I'm not in the area, I'll be in trouble if someone asks me for help.

1915
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:29,390
Seeing as I won't be there for you, you might have a hard time calling me for help.

1916
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:30,350
Sorry, sorry!

1917
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:32,670
Silly me!

1918
01:32:33,530 --> 01:32:36,610
Well then, how about we reunite the zombies?

1919
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:39,570
In order to save Rinka-chan!

1920
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:43,410
Yeah, I'm gonna beat those zombies for Rinka's sake!

1921
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:46,030
Oh my god, she zoomed off!

1922
01:32:47,370 --> 01:32:48,150
Kanon, you okay?

1923
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:49,590
For the sake of my friends.

1924
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:53,630
I don't think Kanon has any friends.

1925
01:32:55,330 --> 01:32:56,950
For your friend.

1926
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:57,570
Miracle.

1927
01:32:58,310 --> 01:32:59,390
I hope she wakes up.

1928
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:01,470
We're gonna need a miracle.

1929
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:05,450
Pizza?

1930
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,350
Oh my god!

1931
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,460
Give me hearts!

1932
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,600
Drown!

1933
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:29,720
Give me more hearts!

1934
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,740
Give me more hearts!

1935
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:36,000
Give me hearts!

1936
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:40,820
You guys want brains, I want hearts!

1937
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,160
Oh, nice!

1938
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:46,100
Yoshi!

1939
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:46,640
ак

1940
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:09,580
I don't know what that just implied but...

1941
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:09,880
Oh, gosh.

1942
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:11,900
There's even this wall here.

1943
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:13,080
Yoshi!

1944
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:19,900
Let's also do the grenade.

1945
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,140
I think this can be a pretty good passive.

1946
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:25,220
Oh my gosh, wait.

1947
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:27,600
You guys, we're about to get... oh gosh.

1948
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:32,040
I think that was my skill that I heard.

1949
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:39,500
I thought we were about to get... what's the word?

1950
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:40,380
Trapped?

1951
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:48,310
More drone!

1952
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,680
Let's do more drone.

1953
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:11,650
A dog!

1954
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:13,670
Oh my god, you guys.

1955
01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:18,810
I'm a terrible... no.

1956
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,410
It's just dog-shaped.

1957
01:35:20,830 --> 01:35:21,810
It's not a dog.

1958
01:35:22,190 --> 01:35:23,810
It's just dog-shaped, you guys.

1959
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:24,530
It's dog-shaped.

1960
01:35:28,230 --> 01:35:29,030
It's not real.

1961
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:29,690
It's not real.

1962
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:30,290
It's not real.

1963
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:30,910
It's not real.

1964
01:35:31,090 --> 01:35:31,870
It's not real.

1965
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:33,210
It's not real.

1966
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:33,930
It's not real.

1967
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:34,290
It's not real.

1968
01:35:34,290 --> 01:35:34,490
It's not real.

1969
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:35,010
It's not real.

1970
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:38,630
Okay, can you stop throwing the grenades like in useless places?

1971
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:39,110
Thank you.

1972
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:41,670
Oh my god.

1973
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,190
Just ignore him.

1974
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:44,330
Just ignore that.

1975
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:46,190
Oh my god, the drones take care of him for me.

1976
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:47,390
I have no guilt.

1977
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:48,450
I have no guilt.

1978
01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:49,970
Magnetic field!

1979
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,570
He's just a boy!

1980
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:11,470
He looks kind of aggressive, though.

1981
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:16,870
Let's do the auto-heal as well.

1982
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:18,610
It's pretty good to have.

1983
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:19,350
Nice.

1984
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:19,690
Oh!

1985
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:20,090
Oh!

1986
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:20,410
Oh!

1987
01:36:20,410 --> 01:36:20,650
Oh!

1988
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:23,010
Nice!

1989
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:27,630
Nice!

1990
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:28,330
Okay.

1991
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:32,490
Having at least two maids on our side is pretty good, I'd say.

1992
01:36:34,690 --> 01:36:35,470
Alright, girls.

1993
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:37,070
Let's fight.

1994
01:36:38,570 --> 01:36:39,910
Heaven or hell.

1995
01:36:41,190 --> 01:36:43,030
You're going somewhere tonight.

1996
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:47,050
Hello, I'm so late.

1997
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:47,350
Hello!

1998
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:58,590
All you missed was there's a zombie apocalypse and we fight in Akihabara as a maid.

1999
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:04,930
Nice.

2000
01:37:05,150 --> 01:37:05,930
Nice!

2001
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:09,190
I love drones.

2002
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:20,620
Does it feel like... It doesn't really feel like we're that much faster, I'll be honest.

2003
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:24,560
Let's see.

2004
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:27,720
Oh, the optimized... Oh, shoot.

2005
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:28,900
I should have grabbed that.

2006
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,740
I'll get it when it comes back around.

2007
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:32,940
Where's the boss?

2008
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:38,900
Where's the boss, after all?

2009
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:41,720
Drones are the future.

2010
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,220
The

2011
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:54,540
song's on rotation.

2012
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:58,940
Let's see.

2013
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,480
Oh, this is the max.

2014
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:05,500
We'll do the max.

2015
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:07,920
Oh, what's that?

2016
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:09,340
Ooh.

2017
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:14,100
Oh, I think that's the thing that helps us get more...

2018
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:17,600
Uh, stuff for...

2019
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:19,980
Leveling up.

2020
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:20,700
For skills.

2021
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:31,260
Oh, I just realized the normal grenade.

2022
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:32,920
We've been using the fire grenade.

2023
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,240
I like the fire grenade, though.

2024
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,420
Guys, we're at max dronage.

2025
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:45,580
We're at max dronage, I believe.

2026
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:48,560
Um...

2027
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,040
Oh, never mind.

2028
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,880
We can always have more drones.

2029
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:55,140
Oh, gosh!

2030
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:59,280
I just noticed their shadows as they came down on me.

2031
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:00,580
No!

2032
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:03,140
Die, zombie!

2033
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,000
Everybody must die!

2034
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:18,200
Oh, my god!

2035
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:20,980
Holy moly.

2036
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:22,800
Uh...

2037
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:25,800
Oh, my gosh.

2038
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:26,400
Oh, god.

2039
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:26,920
Girlies.

2040
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:28,160
Girlies, move out.

2041
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:28,860
Move out, girlies.

2042
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:30,380
Move out, move out.

2043
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:34,220
I gotta be more...

2044
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:36,840
The shadows show up and, like, the...

2045
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:38,980
They drop down so quickly.

2046
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:39,500
See?

2047
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:40,460
Oh, there it is.

2048
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:42,100
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

2049
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,000
I got you, I got you!

2050
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,480
Oh, more, more, more!

2051
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:46,760
I got you, I got you.

2052
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:53,480
Hmm...

2053
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:57,280
We can do more power.

2054
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:58,440
Holy cow.

2055
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:05,970
Watch out!

2056
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:09,690
Oh, oh, lolololo.

2057
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:11,850
Strength.

2058
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:14,590
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2059
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:15,450
Oh, my god.

2060
01:40:15,470 --> 01:40:15,970
Watch out, girls.

2061
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:16,530
Watch out!

2062
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:17,350
Watch out!

2063
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,000
We gotta get out of this corner.

2064
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:31,040
Come on!

2065
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:32,480
Keep walking!

2066
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:40,280
Yeah!

2067
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:41,740
They're all getting taken out.

2068
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:51,660
Let's do a tackle.

2069
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:51,840
There we go.

2070
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,560
The faster we can attack, the better.

2071
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:57,620
And my health is healing.

2072
01:40:57,820 --> 01:41:01,420
It's auto-heal, so it's not bad at all.

2073
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:04,380
These guys are all...

2074
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:06,740
Holy cow!

2075
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,200
There's so many of them!

2076
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:16,320
There's so many of them!

2077
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:25,080
Just drop the...

2078
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:25,500
Ow!

2079
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:27,560
Uh-oh.

2080
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,300
What's going on?

2081
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:31,120
I hear footsteps.

2082
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:33,260
Oh, my god.

2083
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,040
There's blood everywhere.

2084
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:39,460
I missed the giant...

2085
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:40,180
I missed the treasure.

2086
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:40,960
Oh, well.

2087
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:44,160
I didn't realize how dark it'd be in here without the lights on.

2088
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,660
If I don't pay close attention, I might trip and fall over something.

2089
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:54,280
Oh, what was that?

2090
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:54,980
Oh.

2091
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:55,060
Oh.

2092
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:02,860
Oh, no!

2093
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:04,080
I'm a zombie.

2094
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:05,100
Oh, no!

2095
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:06,980
Miss Nagisa, on your right is some shattered glass.

2096
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,680
You'll be fine with those shoes, but please be wary.

2097
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:10,300
Ah?

2098
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,540
Why is there a piece of glass there?

2099
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:13,720
Did you know that?

2100
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:17,420
You know I can't see the situation, do you?

2101
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:19,680
How do you know about the glass, Ganon?

2102
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:21,820
You can't see what's going on, can you?

2103
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,060
I have a small camera on my phone.

2104
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:25,040
Oh?

2105
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:25,200
Oh!

2106
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:27,940
The codec.

2107
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,120
There's a miniature camera in the communication device.

2108
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:34,340
I can switch it to night vision mode.

2109
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:36,800
So everything is crystal clear to me.

2110
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,540
I love her outfit, oh my gosh.

2111
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:40,400
Combat made, so awesome.

2112
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:41,640
Wait!

2113
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:46,800
Her uniform is kind of similar to mine, isn't it?

2114
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:47,640
With like the...

2115
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:51,440
With her collar, and then my collar, and then...

2116
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:56,960
Oh, mine... the only difference is mine is off the shoulder sleeves.

2117
01:42:58,820 --> 01:42:59,300
Huh!

2118
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:01,760
How funny.

2119
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,660
Technology sure is impressive these days.

2120
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:13,100
However,

2121
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:21,100
using the camera will run down the battery, so I won't be using it for long.

2122
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,720
All you need is an assault rifle.

2123
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:26,520
So true.

2124
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:30,160
Mint, fit it better?

2125
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:30,780
No.

2126
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:31,960
Stab.

2127
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:36,380
It's pretty small, so the battery isn't anything special.

2128
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:39,140
Sending video through constantly will drain it quickly.

2129
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:42,780
Yeah, it's like I'm a maid or something.

2130
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:43,520
Crazy.

2131
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:47,940
I guess even this has a weakness.

2132
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:50,560
I can't tell if it's useful or not when you say it like that.

2133
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:54,100
It's just a machine.

2134
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:57,380
In situations like these, I don't really rely on it that much.

2135
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:01,540
It's just a machine at the end of the day, so relying on it too much wouldn't be wise.

2136
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:07,480
After the pandemic, the power supply has stopped, and the power is out of charge.

2137
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,660
Because of the pandemic, a lot of places are out of power.

2138
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:13,520
Charging it could be troublesome.

2139
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:21,040
To tell you the truth, the reason for releasing the zone controlled by zombies was to set up power facilities and to restore power.

2140
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:23,180
Oh...

2141
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:28,300
Oh, to be frank, we're trying to take back this area from the zombies in order to gain access to a power generator.

2142
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:28,940
Who is we?

2143
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:31,260
Who is we?

2144
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:32,740
You, Kanon?

2145
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:34,180
I'm trying to find my friend.

2146
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,800
You really are thinking this through, aren't you, Kanon?

2147
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:46,820
We is you.

2148
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,100
Me and you?

2149
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:50,020
I didn't agree to this.

2150
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:53,160
More battle made mint art ideas.

2151
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:58,400
For vaccine... Sorry if you can hear my chair popping.

2152
01:44:58,700 --> 01:44:59,180
Oh my goodness.

2153
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:04,820
From vaccine making to researching the virus, electricity is going to be a major factor we'll have to consider.

2154
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:05,720
Oh my god.

2155
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:07,760
Am I going to become an electrician too?

2156
01:45:16,370 --> 01:45:17,350
Though it's been a while.

2157
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:19,830
Before the pandemic, I used to have lunch around here often.

2158
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:24,750
Chair upgrade when?

2159
01:45:25,450 --> 01:45:26,730
When this chair...

2160
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:29,270
I truly can't sit my butt anymore.

2161
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:32,050
You too, Kanon?

2162
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:33,910
We used to come here before, actually.

2163
01:45:34,150 --> 01:45:36,090
Does that mean you used to work in Akihabara too?

2164
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:39,670
I think Kanon is the cause of the virus.

2165
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:43,450
You there?

2166
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:53,600
What was it?

2167
01:45:58,260 --> 01:45:59,360
Seems like it.

2168
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:01,120
But for one to have that sort of agility...

2169
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:12,130
You must be serious, Kanon.

2170
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:18,550
I didn't know that this cafe made you have a color-coded, you know, panties too.

2171
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:20,110
Zombie.

2172
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:21,950
Oh my gosh, look at her.

2173
01:46:22,390 --> 01:46:23,550
Wow, oh my gosh.

2174
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:23,790
Wait.

2175
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:26,110
Twins?

2176
01:46:26,850 --> 01:46:28,710
Do they have the same garter belt even?

2177
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:32,430
Twins?

2178
01:46:32,430 --> 01:46:33,370
You guys have the same garter belt even.

2179
01:46:33,370 --> 01:46:33,770
Twins?

2180
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:41,470
Oh my god, Rinka is the boss.

2181
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,680
Same underwear too.

2182
01:46:53,530 --> 01:46:54,950
I'm not showing you that.

2183
01:46:57,610 --> 01:46:58,310
That's her?

2184
01:46:59,550 --> 01:47:00,110
We?

2185
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:00,770
Who is we?

2186
01:47:00,910 --> 01:47:02,590
There is no we in this fandom.

2187
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:04,590
Rinka-chan!

2188
01:47:04,930 --> 01:47:05,490
Nagisa!

2189
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:09,440
It's me, Nagisa!

2190
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:11,580
It's dangerous, Nagisa-san.

2191
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:13,200
Rinka-san is already at the edge.

2192
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:16,420
Oh, Rinka is already starting to transform.

2193
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:17,740
I think she... I mean...

2194
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:18,660
Yeah?

2195
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:21,560
We painted some of this screenshot green.

2196
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,040
Ay ay ay ay ay.

2197
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:28,140
But... but...

2198
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:32,140
She isn't attacking.

2199
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:35,400
If she's a zombie, she'll attack you with her impulsive attacks.

2200
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:37,740
Oh my god, speak up, Kannon.

2201
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,340
I can't hear you over this sick rift.

2202
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:42,000
What?

2203
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:45,300
Zombies should automatically start attacking any human they can see.

2204
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:57,280
Could she have heard Ms. Nagisa's voice and stopped attacking?

2205
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:00,780
No, a virus at this level would block out anything like that.

2206
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,020
Kannon-chan!

2207
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:03,160
What should I do?

2208
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:04,440
Oh, sorry, rift.

2209
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:06,500
What should I do to save Rinka-chan?

2210
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:10,020
This rift in my heart.

2211
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:12,860
Sorry.

2212
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:16,280
No, no, no, no, no.

2213
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,300
This too is Yuri.

2214
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:21,560
Nice rift.

2215
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,200
Oh my god.

2216
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:28,820
What should I do?

2217
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:30,120
How do I save her?

2218
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:42,200
If Ms. Rinka is still aware, then her brain must not have been fully infected yet.

2219
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:42,780
Oh my god.

2220
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:43,560
Kiss her.

2221
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:46,280
She's only a partial zombie.

2222
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:49,000
In other words, she's only a partial zombie.

2223
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:49,740
Maybe she's resisting.

2224
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:53,080
Her body must be fighting the virus as we speak.

2225
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:58,560
That means if we just give her the vaccine, she'll get better, right?

2226
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:03,120
That means if we jab her with the vaccine, she'll go back to normal, right?

2227
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:04,440
That's possible.

2228
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:06,620
But it's not a start.

2229
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:08,360
She's probably losing her mind.

2230
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:10,060
Oh, oh, oh.

2231
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:13,660
There's a chance, but her condition is getting worse and she's losing awareness by the minute.

2232
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:16,060
Okay, but quit your yapping then.

2233
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:22,440
Holding her down and bringing her back to base like that is going to be risky.

2234
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:29,480
If there's even a sliver of a chance, I want to take it.

2235
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:32,840
Understood.

2236
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,020
Hold her down!

2237
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:36,680
Hold her down!

2238
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,480
I'll be preparing the vaccine as planned.

2239
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,000
Dang, Kanon is so fast.

2240
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:46,680
The zombie apocalypse just happened like today and she's already got a vaccine.

2241
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:49,580
Wow.

2242
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:54,380
Should've put her in charge of the 2020 pandemic.

2243
01:49:56,900 --> 01:50:02,140
Also, if we can get samples from someone else who didn't immediately transform, that'd also help my research.

2244
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,340
Thank you, Kanon-chan!

2245
01:50:05,540 --> 01:50:11,320
But the only person who can stop Rinka-san from moving and bring her back is Nagisa-san.

2246
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:18,000
But understand that you're the only one who can stop Miss Rinka and bring her back here.

2247
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:18,660
Yup!

2248
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:19,640
I understand!

2249
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,120
Let's shoot her!☀

2250
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:28,680
...It's gonna be alright, Rinka-chan.

2251
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:30,900
We'll definitely save you no matter what!

2252
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:32,200
We'll save you no matter what.

2253
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:33,560
☀ She's like...

2254
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:36,620
Oh my god, oh my god !!

2255
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:38,660
Rika-chan...

2256
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:40,600
Rika-chan...

2257
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:43,640
...it is you Chief...

2258
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:45,020
I mean, back mid-battle.

2259
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:50,290
Watch out, girls!

2260
01:50:52,410 --> 01:50:54,230
Don't take any more damage like that.

2261
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:55,670
You're scaring me.

2262
01:51:02,410 --> 01:51:03,910
More vaccine stuff.

2263
01:51:05,670 --> 01:51:06,990
How are my maids doing?

2264
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:09,750
Where are my maids?

2265
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:11,010
Oh, there's one left!

2266
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:18,790
Gosh, I'm gonna get cornered here.

2267
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:21,850
I'm gonna get cornered here.

2268
01:51:22,110 --> 01:51:22,590
Oh no!

2269
01:51:26,910 --> 01:51:27,790
Oh, I think we got...

2270
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:32,110
I can't see myself, I have so many drones.

2271
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:39,710
I had too many drones, you couldn't even see my little sprite.

2272
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:42,290
Yay!

2273
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:47,850
Super bar is full, but you don't even need it.

2274
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:48,810
Yeah, we're all good.

2275
01:51:49,090 --> 01:51:50,370
I'm going back to base.

2276
01:51:51,930 --> 01:51:56,210
After the battle with Rinka ended, I carried her back to base because she was too exhausted to move.

2277
01:51:56,330 --> 01:52:01,230
As Kanon-chan said, as expected, I'm not a complete zombie yet.

2278
01:52:01,810 --> 01:52:02,610
I think...

2279
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:07,470
I think it's supposed to say, it was just as Kanon had said.

2280
01:52:07,590 --> 01:52:09,510
Rinka's body was in the process of transforming.

2281
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:12,930
If the treatment goes well, Rinka-chan will be healed.

2282
01:52:15,690 --> 01:52:17,650
But, if it doesn't...

2283
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:22,730
If everything goes well, then she'll return to normal.

2284
01:52:22,890 --> 01:52:25,270
But if she doesn't, I don't know what I'll do.

2285
01:52:26,930 --> 01:52:28,330
Fire the cannon, Kanon.

2286
01:52:28,410 --> 01:52:29,210
Wait, why is there...

2287
01:52:35,670 --> 01:52:37,770
Why does this exist in the maid cafe?

2288
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:41,810
Miss Nagisa, everything is ready.

2289
01:52:42,030 --> 01:52:45,090
Oh yeah, sometimes they put two ends for Kanon, and sometimes just one.

2290
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:49,010
It's... it's okay, we're not here so much for this.

2291
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:49,810
Translation, right?

2292
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:54,490
If it goes well, then we'll be able to fix Miss Rinka just as planned.

2293
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:55,310
This one.

2294
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:58,670
What if the vaccine doesn't work as intended?

2295
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:02,690
What if the vaccine doesn't work as intended?

2296
01:53:03,150 --> 01:53:03,550
Yeah.

2297
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:04,810
I know.

2298
01:53:06,110 --> 01:53:06,990
So please.

2299
01:53:08,890 --> 01:53:10,590
Just please go through with it.

2300
01:53:11,290 --> 01:53:12,430
I didn't have to say anything.

2301
01:53:15,130 --> 01:53:16,950
Well then, let's start the treatment.

2302
01:53:17,770 --> 01:53:18,770
Role play room?

2303
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:19,670
Probably.

2304
01:53:20,110 --> 01:53:22,190
This is probably the maid cafe next door.

2305
01:53:22,710 --> 01:53:23,890
It's hospital themed.

2306
01:53:24,210 --> 01:53:28,490
And you sit... you have to lay in your bed and eat your food that way.

2307
01:53:30,310 --> 01:53:32,330
I guess I don't need to say anymore.

2308
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:34,530
Well then, let us begin the procedure.

2309
01:53:37,470 --> 01:53:37,950
Saving.

2310
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:47,950
I don't think we need to save her at all.

2311
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:49,930
I don't think... this is... this is...

2312
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:51,450
I don't think we need to save her at all.

2313
01:53:55,090 --> 01:53:57,010
We don't need to save her at all.

2314
01:53:57,050 --> 01:53:57,890
What are you talking about?

2315
01:53:58,330 --> 01:54:00,410
Let her... let her stay, please!

2316
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:01,930
Oh my god, no.

2317
01:54:02,830 --> 01:54:03,650
No, please.

2318
01:54:03,730 --> 01:54:04,670
Don't make me do this.

2319
01:54:05,190 --> 01:54:06,130
She's perfect.

2320
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:08,230
She's perfect the way she is.

2321
01:54:14,770 --> 01:54:15,830
Oh my god.

2322
01:54:15,930 --> 01:54:16,770
The teeth.

2323
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:17,570
The eyes.

2324
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:18,370
The skin.

2325
01:54:19,290 --> 01:54:19,770
Aaaaaah!

2326
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:21,590
Aaaaaah!

2327
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:23,690
You can fix her.

2328
01:54:23,830 --> 01:54:24,430
She's our...

2329
01:54:24,430 --> 01:54:25,750
She's... this is an improvement.

2330
01:54:26,010 --> 01:54:26,850
She's already fixed.

2331
01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:29,590
Why is the music so loud?

2332
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:31,370
You can treat any zombified maids.

2333
01:54:31,590 --> 01:54:35,350
Maids will become zombified if you defeat them as enemies and take them back to base.

2334
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:37,290
Or if they are defeated in battle after deployment.

2335
01:54:38,890 --> 01:54:39,690
Oh my god.

2336
01:54:40,650 --> 01:54:42,210
She's so cute.

2337
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:50,780
Zombified maids cannot be deployed.

2338
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:52,160
Make sure to treat them immediately.

2339
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:53,040
Furthermore...

2340
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:57,280
If all of your maids have been zombified, it will result in a game over.

2341
01:54:58,480 --> 01:54:59,280
Game, please!

2342
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:01,000
Game!

2343
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:02,800
To heal, you need a vaccine.

2344
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:04,680
If you run out, you can purchase them in the item shop.

2345
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:11,260
By shaking vaccine bottles, you can max out their shake gauge.

2346
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:15,140
Once full, treatment will be applied to the target.

2347
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:16,220
I don't think that's...

2348
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:17,920
What kind of vaccine is this?

2349
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:25,360
Hey, no spoilers!

2350
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:28,060
By spreading the vaccine, the patient will slowly heal.

2351
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:31,380
Make sure to spread it around enough until they are fully recovered.

2352
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:33,960
Why is it a topical vaccine?

2353
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:37,320
I could fix her.

2354
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:38,300
I just don't want to.

2355
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:44,120
Maids that have already completed their treatment can skip this option during the base treatment selection.

2356
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:48,080
I'm shaking it.

2357
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:50,260
I'm shaking it.

2358
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:51,740
I'm shaking it.

2359
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:53,020
I'm shaking it.

2360
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:00,800
I'm shaking it.

2361
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:01,440
I'm shaking it.

2362
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:02,680
I'm shaking it.

2363
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:03,620
I'm shaking it.

2364
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:04,780
I'm shaking it.

2365
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:05,860
I'm shaking it.

2366
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:06,740
I'm shaking it.

2367
01:56:06,940 --> 01:56:07,460
I'm shaking it.

2368
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:08,980
I'm shaking it.

2369
01:56:08,980 --> 01:56:09,240
I'm shaking it.

2370
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:09,580
I'm shaking it.

2371
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:09,980
I'm shaking it.

2372
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:14,460
I'm shaking it.

2373
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:15,040
I'm shaking it.

2374
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:16,140
I'm shaking it.

2375
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:16,860
I'm shaking it.

2376
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:17,340
I'm shaking it.

2377
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:18,700
I'm shaking it.

2378
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:19,660
I'm shaking it.

2379
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:20,660
I'm shaking it.

2380
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:23,680
I'm shaking it.

2381
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:25,620
I'm shaking it.

2382
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:31,840
I'm sorry that I must cure you.

2383
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:32,420
I'm sorry.

2384
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:35,560
This is... I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

2385
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:38,340
You were perfect the way you were, Dinka.

2386
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:40,860
I could... I would... I would take you as you were.

2387
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:43,440
Okay, using medicine, go!

2388
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:55,080
The color is returning to her eyes!

2389
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:57,380
Shiko, shiko, shiko.

2390
01:56:57,740 --> 01:56:58,880
Shiko, shiko, shiko.

2391
01:56:59,300 --> 01:56:59,920
Shiko, shiko.

2392
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:00,860
I love live 2D.

2393
01:57:01,460 --> 01:57:02,520
Shiko, shiko, shiko.

2394
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:03,560
Shiko, shiko.

2395
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:04,760
Shiko, shiko.

2396
01:57:04,940 --> 01:57:06,100
You guys, it's medicine!

2397
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:09,740
This is... This is for... medicinal purposes.

2398
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:13,080
I walked all the way... away for 30 minutes?

2399
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:15,820
Yeah.

2400
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:16,960
She looks concerned?

2401
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:18,060
I mean, she was a zombie.

2402
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:20,640
Don't worry about it.

2403
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:23,680
I'm just... I'm just jorking it in the hospital real quick.

2404
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:26,560
And by it, I mean my medicine.

2405
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:28,700
Again?

2406
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,360
More?

2407
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:32,180
I think she's okay.

2408
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:33,660
Oh, nope.

2409
01:57:33,740 --> 01:57:34,420
Let's keep going.

2410
01:57:35,860 --> 01:57:36,740
Oh, never mind.

2411
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:37,780
Success!

2412
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,380
Stop it, Shinji!

2413
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,920
That's what... yeah, Shinji was doing, maybe.

2414
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:52,020
Oh, you're still here?

2415
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:52,760
Yeah.

2416
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:54,600
I wanted to be by Rinka-chan's side.

2417
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:58,280
See, you don't know when you'll wake up, right?

2418
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:01,780
I think we all should have assumed that it would be a topical medicine.

2419
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:07,400
I'm jorking my medicine right now, too.

2420
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:10,400
I don't wanna know... I don't know what... You know what?

2421
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:11,300
You're being healthy.

2422
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:15,200
Everybody, jork your medicine.

2423
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,000
Take your vitamins, okay?

2424
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:19,300
I wanted to be with Rinka.

2425
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:21,740
We don't know when she'll wake up, you know?

2426
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:25,140
I understand how you feel, but Nagisa-san is also tired.

2427
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:26,520
I'm so messed up.

2428
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:28,260
She fought so many zombies.

2429
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,680
She needs to rest a little.

2430
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:34,640
I understand how you feel, but you must be exhausted as well.

2431
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:36,460
Don't forget that you need to rest, too.

2432
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:39,820
I can't afford to rest.

2433
01:58:39,820 --> 01:58:40,340
Take your meds.

2434
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:43,920
If Rinka-chan doesn't get better soon, we might have to fight again.

2435
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:46,340
I can't afford to rest now.

2436
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:49,280
If Rinka wakes up and she's not healed, I'll have to fight again.

2437
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:52,080
If that happens, it'll be dangerous for Kano-chan alone.

2438
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:57,460
If I close my eyes, I'll be reminded of all the bad things I've done.

2439
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:58,640
I'll be reminded of all the bad things I've done.

2440
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:03,540
And you made fun of me for making a joke in a joke a while ago.

2441
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:06,180
Oh my gosh.

2442
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:10,100
Angel, I'm so sorry I missed your very spooky dono earlier.

2443
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:16,180
Finally back from the US and can enjoy my Kamiyoshi live again without having grass to touch or some such.

2444
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:19,960
Just so you know, this trip never would have happened if it wasn't for you, so thank you.

2445
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:20,600
What?

2446
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:24,840
I did nothing.

2447
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:28,120
Thank you!

2448
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:31,900
Thank you!

2449
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:33,840
If it comes to that, then you'll be in danger too.

2450
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:38,820
Besides, every time I close my eyes, all I see is unpleasant memories of the medicine.

2451
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:41,960
Every time I close my eyes, I imagine the medicines.

2452
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:46,340
But if Miss Rinka doesn't revert back, I'm pretty sure it worked.

2453
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:46,940
I'm just saying.

2454
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:51,220
Boys, we know how to stop the apocalypse.

2455
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,600
Do you have the antibodies?

2456
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:58,640
Do you have the antibodies?

2457
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:00,460
To stop the apocalypse?

2458
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:08,100
I know it needs to be done.

2459
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:10,780
But I believe that it won't come to that.

2460
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:12,020
Rinka is strong.

2461
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:12,980
She'll definitely recover.

2462
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:15,800
Only one way to find out.

2463
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:18,340
You could be one in a million.

2464
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:24,820
I'll be continuing my efforts in refining the vaccine.

2465
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:27,220
I think it works perfectly fine.

2466
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:31,020
So please keep an eye on Miss Rinka.

2467
02:00:32,220 --> 02:00:33,820
Just like my Japanese anime.

2468
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:35,420
She's awake.

2469
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:37,460
She needs a shower, probably.

2470
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:40,420
Never mind.

2471
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:42,900
It all absorbed into her skin.

2472
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:44,040
Wow.

2473
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:47,060
Where am I?

2474
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:53,000
Rinka-chan!

2475
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:53,900
Wake up!

2476
02:01:00,110 --> 02:01:01,570
Why are you...

2477
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:04,290
I don't remember.

2478
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:04,510
I'm sure...

2479
02:01:04,510 --> 02:01:07,030
Yeah, the underwear is color-coded.

2480
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:07,830
It is, it is.

2481
02:01:07,870 --> 02:01:08,330
And then...

2482
02:01:10,030 --> 02:01:11,070
Nakisa, why are you...

2483
02:01:11,070 --> 02:01:13,730
I remember getting bit by a zombie and...

2484
02:01:13,730 --> 02:01:14,310
You don't remember?

2485
02:01:16,110 --> 02:01:17,270
You forgot what happened?

2486
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:20,070
I don't know.

2487
02:01:20,290 --> 02:01:21,790
I can't wait until we get our next girl.

2488
02:01:22,070 --> 02:01:22,670
What happened after you broke up with Nakisa?

2489
02:01:27,570 --> 02:01:28,610
I don't know.

2490
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:30,270
I remember we split up, but...

2491
02:01:30,270 --> 02:01:31,290
Everything after that...

2492
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:32,050
Is hazy.

2493
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:41,990
Just a reminder.

2494
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:44,890
Kanon made the vaccine and decided it should be a topical.

2495
02:01:46,830 --> 02:01:49,410
Yeah, I think we should infect Rinka again.

2496
02:01:49,530 --> 02:01:49,990
I'm just saying.

2497
02:01:51,070 --> 02:01:54,110
Seems like your memories from after you were bitten have been affected.

2498
02:01:54,390 --> 02:01:55,310
Do you feel sick?

2499
02:01:55,370 --> 02:01:56,190
Or dizzy, perhaps?

2500
02:01:56,670 --> 02:01:58,190
I mean, look at this CG.

2501
02:01:58,370 --> 02:01:59,150
It's so cute.

2502
02:01:59,370 --> 02:02:00,230
Look at them.

2503
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:01,590
So cute.

2504
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:02,870
And now this one...

2505
02:02:04,230 --> 02:02:05,010
Who are you?

2506
02:02:05,290 --> 02:02:05,570
Who are you?

2507
02:02:05,570 --> 02:02:06,890
Self introduction and explanation later.

2508
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:10,350
First, you are to check how well Rinka is.

2509
02:02:11,610 --> 02:02:12,050
Hmm.

2510
02:02:12,210 --> 02:02:13,690
Let's say the formalities for later.

2511
02:02:13,870 --> 02:02:16,470
Our first priority is to check you over and see how you're doing.

2512
02:02:16,730 --> 02:02:19,530
You may have had a variant of the virus yet...

2513
02:02:19,530 --> 02:02:21,110
Oh no, I've been bit.

2514
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:21,410
...

2515
02:02:21,410 --> 02:02:21,410
extra experiences.

2516
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:23,990
I have the vaccine.

2517
02:02:25,710 --> 02:02:26,150
Shuko.

2518
02:02:26,310 --> 02:02:26,470
Shuko.

2519
02:02:26,650 --> 02:02:26,890
Shuko.

2520
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:27,570
Shuko.

2521
02:02:28,230 --> 02:02:28,670
Shuko.

2522
02:02:29,170 --> 02:02:29,290
Shuko.

2523
02:02:29,530 --> 02:02:29,630
Shuko.

2524
02:02:29,790 --> 02:02:29,810
Shuko.

2525
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:30,010
Shuko.

2526
02:02:30,610 --> 02:02:31,050
Shuko.

2527
02:02:31,050 --> 02:02:31,270
Shuko.

2528
02:02:31,270 --> 02:02:33,950
You still may have some lingering effects from the virus.

2529
02:02:34,170 --> 02:02:35,770
So it's important to do a thorough check.

2530
02:02:36,310 --> 02:02:36,830
Virus...

2531
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:38,610
The virus, huh?

2532
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:47,480
Why aren't her clothes destroyed here?

2533
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:49,380
Cowards.

2534
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:53,700
I see.

2535
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:55,400
You were the one that made the vaccine.

2536
02:02:55,620 --> 02:02:56,720
Thank you so much.

2537
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:58,060
I wouldn't be here without you.

2538
02:03:04,460 --> 02:03:05,560
All I did was make it.

2539
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:07,260
The one that saved you was Miss Nagisa.

2540
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:11,900
Vaccine fixed the clothes too?

2541
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:13,120
Not in the CG!

2542
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:17,020
Even after being attacked by zombies, she never gave up.

2543
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:18,620
She was determined to save you.

2544
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:27,560
Nagisa, you risked your life for me?

2545
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:33,640
Are you mad, Rinka?

2546
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:34,440
Why would she be mad?

2547
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:35,520
A little.

2548
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:36,460
A little?

2549
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:38,060
I'm grateful for your help.

2550
02:03:40,260 --> 02:03:40,700
But...

2551
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:42,980
I can't believe I'm doing something so dangerous.

2552
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:46,340
Of course I'm...

2553
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:47,020
Oh, a little.

2554
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:48,820
Of course I'm grateful that you saved me.

2555
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:50,200
But you put yourself in so much danger.

2556
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:52,540
Rinka, you're too cool.

2557
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:53,940
Oh.

2558
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,320
Says the person who's always trying to play it cool and save others.

2559
02:03:57,880 --> 02:03:58,320
What?

2560
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:03,160
Rinka, you sacrificed yourself to save me.

2561
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:07,180
You sacrificed your own safety for my sake too.

2562
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:09,220
I want to save Rinka too.

2563
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,500
I wanted to save her.

2564
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:12,820
Oh my god, her...

2565
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:17,720
I wanted to save you.

2566
02:04:18,020 --> 02:04:19,100
That's what I did.

2567
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:20,620
Now we're even, okay?

2568
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:23,200
Rinka's face.

2569
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:25,660
Rinka's so cute.

2570
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:28,460
All of them are very cute.

2571
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:32,700
Kyurei is always really good at making very cute girls.

2572
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:33,880
Fine.

2573
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:35,300
Let's just leave it at that.

2574
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:40,060
If I were Nagisa, I would have done the same thing.

2575
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:42,560
I would have done the same thing if I were you.

2576
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:47,260
Now that you have two mates, you'll be able to apply twice as much vaccine to the next girl.

2577
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:49,500
You're better than me, Rinka.

2578
02:04:51,580 --> 02:04:53,220
I can hear you, you know.

2579
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:55,920
Nagisa-san, let's stop talking.

2580
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:00,020
Rinka has just woken up.

2581
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:01,720
She needs to rest.

2582
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:04,560
Okay.

2583
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:05,540
You too.

2584
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:06,680
Let it be for now.

2585
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:09,460
Ms. Rinka just woke up, so she'll need a bit more rest.

2586
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:12,540
Did Kyurei make me in?

2587
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:13,480
No.

2588
02:05:16,430 --> 02:05:17,190
They didn't.

2589
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:21,530
Sounds like a good idea.

2590
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:35,080
Thanks, Kanon.

2591
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:36,920
You're the reason we could save Rinka in the end.

2592
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:38,600
No.

2593
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:39,940
Nagisa-san believed in Rinka-san.

2594
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:41,580
No.

2595
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:44,880
To be honest, it was a miracle that Rinka-san was treated.

2596
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:50,480
Made you lose your nose.

2597
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:51,720
What are you talking about?

2598
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:56,960
We were able to save her because you believed in her.

2599
02:05:57,100 --> 02:05:59,460
To be honest, this is nothing short of a miracle.

2600
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:00,260
Is that so?

2601
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:02,380
But there was a vaccine.

2602
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:03,420
Yes.

2603
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:05,920
But this wasn't thanks to the vaccine?

2604
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:07,600
I mean, yes, it was.

2605
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:09,000
I mean, yes, it was.

2606
02:06:10,060 --> 02:06:10,540
What?

2607
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:17,020
What are you talking about?

2608
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:17,760
It worked!

2609
02:06:19,060 --> 02:06:21,500
We still don't know exactly how effective it is.

2610
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:22,800
And to be honest, I don't...

2611
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:25,220
I didn't think situations like Rinka's were possible.

2612
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,380
Just so you know, I did a test.

2613
02:06:27,460 --> 02:06:29,100
Rinka-san had the same thing as Nagisa-san.

2614
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:31,740
She had antibodies against the virus.

2615
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:33,280
I'm so distracted.

2616
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:36,480
When Kanon talks, there's like a little part here that like...

2617
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:40,860
Like the pixels like start going a little wonky.

2618
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,760
I wanted to make sure, so I ran a couple of tests.

2619
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:48,420
And it seems Miss Rinka also carries an antibody that helped her fight the infection.

2620
02:06:48,620 --> 02:06:49,420
Just like you!

2621
02:06:50,220 --> 02:06:51,780
I wonder where she got that from.

2622
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:52,540
She's the same as me.

2623
02:06:54,100 --> 02:06:54,580
But...

2624
02:06:54,580 --> 02:06:55,860
Isn't that strange?

2625
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:57,880
I'm not a zombie.

2626
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:00,680
Why is Rinka-chan the only one?

2627
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:02,240
The same as me?

2628
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:03,560
But that doesn't make sense.

2629
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:05,080
I didn't transform at all.

2630
02:07:05,380 --> 02:07:07,760
The antibodies don't completely prevent infection and infection.

2631
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:11,600
See it?

2632
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:15,880
Nagisa-san, if you get bitten by a lot of zombies, you might get infected.

2633
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:19,340
Antibodies don't completely block the virus.

2634
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:22,420
So it's possible you might still transform if bitten enough.

2635
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:25,620
Don't scare me, Kanon-chan!

2636
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:26,380
What happens here too.

2637
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:28,260
I see it now.

2638
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:30,580
Don't scare me like that!

2639
02:07:30,580 --> 02:07:31,020
Kanon!

2640
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:31,520
It's a fact.

2641
02:07:32,540 --> 02:07:33,620
Don't forget about it.

2642
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:36,040
The antibodies are not all-purpose.

2643
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:39,460
It was the harvest that confirmed that.

2644
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:41,840
But it's the truth.

2645
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:43,180
So please don't forget it.

2646
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:44,620
Those antibodies aren't perfect.

2647
02:07:44,940 --> 02:07:47,600
Though I'm glad we figured that out from this whole ordeal.

2648
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:53,080
However, even if it does happen, if you have the antibodies, you can slow down the zombie-ization.

2649
02:07:54,860 --> 02:07:56,440
The pixels on her glasses move.

2650
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:56,760
I know!

2651
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:58,000
It's kind of distracting.

2652
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:04,120
Even if someone were to start having symptoms, it seems as though the antibodies slowed down the entire process.

2653
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:08,780
I'm starting to think this game may not be scientifically accurate.

2654
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:12,980
This information will be useful in the future.

2655
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:15,220
No...

2656
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:19,200
No...

2657
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:25,920
They've consulted so many doctors for this game, I think.

2658
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:32,360
If we act fast during that phase, we may be able to stop the zombie-ification.

2659
02:08:32,660 --> 02:08:34,400
This is useful information to have.

2660
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:35,440
Oh my gosh.

2661
02:08:35,580 --> 02:08:37,300
I want a zombified...

2662
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:39,340
Oh, I can't wait to find our next zombified girl.

2663
02:08:40,340 --> 02:08:41,200
Give it to me.

2664
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:47,960
Then, if we can make enough vaccines, everyone would have the antibodies, right?

2665
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:50,540
That'd make the virus a lot easier to deal with.

2666
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:51,420
Yes.

2667
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:52,720
I hope we can end the pandemic.

2668
02:08:54,860 --> 02:08:55,300
Napmas!

2669
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:56,260
Welcome to membership.

2670
02:08:56,420 --> 02:08:56,820
Thank you!

2671
02:08:58,080 --> 02:09:00,360
Maybe the key to ending this pandemic...

2672
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:00,900
What if...

2673
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:02,620
Yeah, what if we zombified Nagisa?

2674
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:04,840
Will it work if she gets caught?

2675
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:06,000
If she, like...

2676
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:10,240
The next girl is going to make me happy.

2677
02:09:12,380 --> 02:09:15,720
Though we still need more samples from others with the antibody to make a stronger vaccine.

2678
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,240
Rinka and I won't be enough?

2679
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:20,960
No!

2680
02:09:21,900 --> 02:09:23,900
She's going to drain your body of blood?

2681
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:25,000
Yes.

2682
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:27,780
To do that, we need to find survivors.

2683
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:29,820
I hope they're maids.

2684
02:09:32,180 --> 02:09:32,780
I hope they're maids.

2685
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:35,240
It's always better to have more samples.

2686
02:09:35,460 --> 02:09:38,300
So we'll have to search for more survivors that are potential carriers.

2687
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:39,300
Got it!

2688
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,780
If that's the case, I'll do something!

2689
02:09:40,780 --> 02:09:42,260
It's the Maid of Geons!

2690
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:43,560
The Maid of Geons!

2691
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:46,240
We can find survivors and protect them, right?

2692
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:48,240
That sounds like something I can do.

2693
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:51,040
We just have to find survivors and protect them, right?

2694
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:52,280
Zombie canon.

2695
02:09:52,900 --> 02:09:53,580
Is that okay?

2696
02:09:53,580 --> 02:09:57,260
I'm sure Nagisa-san has already achieved her goal.

2697
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:59,140
We don't need to put her in any more danger.

2698
02:10:01,220 --> 02:10:02,520
You're fine with doing that?

2699
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:04,660
I thought your goal had already been achieved.

2700
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,980
I don't know why you'd want to danger your own life further.

2701
02:10:08,180 --> 02:10:10,100
I mean, it may... think about it.

2702
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:13,380
You guys can't stay cramped in this little maid cafe.

2703
02:10:13,580 --> 02:10:14,100
You have to, you know?

2704
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:17,060
The reason I was able to save Rinka-chan was thanks to you, Canon-chan.

2705
02:10:18,440 --> 02:10:22,460
Besides, once the vaccine is completed, everyone will be happy, right?

2706
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:25,200
We were able to save Rinka because of your efforts.

2707
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:28,880
So if we can make a stronger vaccine, more people will end up being saved, right?

2708
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:31,800
Then there's no reason not to do it, right?

2709
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:35,980
If it's something I can do, I'm willing to do anything.

2710
02:10:37,060 --> 02:10:39,440
If that's the case, then of course I have to help.

2711
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:40,860
Just let me know what to do.

2712
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:42,600
Sounds like Nagisa-san.

2713
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:44,640
Someone needs to go get the toilet paper.

2714
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:45,160
I understand.

2715
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:45,660
Exactly.

2716
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:46,720
I'll listen to you.

2717
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:48,500
You mostly stay cramped in a maid cafe.

2718
02:10:48,580 --> 02:10:49,080
Shut up.

2719
02:10:49,660 --> 02:10:50,340
Shut up.

2720
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:51,060
I'm haunting.

2721
02:10:51,060 --> 02:10:51,740
It's different.

2722
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:55,360
It sounds just like you, Miss Nagisa.

2723
02:10:55,660 --> 02:10:57,740
In that case, I'll leave it up to you.

2724
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:10,300
We should start by taking back some of the areas overrun with zombies and creating safe zones.

2725
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:13,020
Yeah.

2726
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:16,500
And then we'll investigate those said areas.

2727
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:17,140
Got it!

2728
02:11:17,860 --> 02:11:18,200
Alright!

2729
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:19,740
I'm motivated!

2730
02:11:19,740 --> 02:11:20,140
I can do this!

2731
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:21,060
Yow!

2732
02:11:21,820 --> 02:11:22,900
I'm getting pumped!

2733
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:24,420
I'll do my best!

2734
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:25,480
Yeah!

2735
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:27,720
Ugh.

2736
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:29,400
My throat is starting to hurt.

2737
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:34,640
What the...

2738
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:37,000
That was so fast.

2739
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:39,700
Is it true you found survivors, Kanon?

2740
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:49,200
I was able to confirm that someone had shot off some fireworks.

2741
02:11:49,740 --> 02:11:50,860
That was the fastest.

2742
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:54,900
She just like stepped out for two seconds.

2743
02:11:56,980 --> 02:11:57,300
Fireworks?

2744
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:08,660
It could be that someone was trying to call out for help with them.

2745
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:10,720
They're probably in need of food or water or something.

2746
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:13,400
Okay, we gotta go get the new girl.

2747
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:16,420
I can't wait to see her.

2748
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:17,120
I can't wait to see her.

2749
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:17,920
I can't wait to see her.

2750
02:12:17,980 --> 02:12:18,740
I can't wait to see her.

2751
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:20,940
Wouldn't that be dangerous though?

2752
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:22,920
I mean, don't you think the zombies would notice it?

2753
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:33,120
I'm sure it was a last resort of sorts.

2754
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:34,720
They must be desperate for help.

2755
02:12:42,260 --> 02:12:44,180
We have to save them as quick as we can.

2756
02:12:44,380 --> 02:12:46,780
They might be getting attacked by zombies right this second.

2757
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:50,200
I think we should be the first ones to do so.

2758
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:53,340
Des... Despre...

2759
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:56,040
Sorry, I didn't even notice it.

2760
02:12:56,540 --> 02:12:56,980
Despre...

2761
02:12:57,420 --> 02:12:58,860
You're getting desperate, everybody.

2762
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:00,960
Other survival?

2763
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:03,960
The other's survival might be our biggest priority right now.

2764
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:06,660
Some of them could possibly be carrying the antibody we need.

2765
02:13:08,740 --> 02:13:10,860
You're the only one that can do this, Miss Nagisa.

2766
02:13:13,020 --> 02:13:16,300
If Kanon was in charge of carrying the big sea, it would have been over in two months.

2767
02:13:16,360 --> 02:13:17,180
That's what I'm saying!

2768
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:19,160
We all need a Kanon.

2769
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:21,340
We need a Kanon in this world.

2770
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:23,880
You're the only one that can do this, Miss Nagisa.

2771
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:25,240
Are there any objections?

2772
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:26,080
Of course!

2773
02:13:27,780 --> 02:13:28,820
Kanon-chan will support you with her transmitter.

2774
02:13:32,380 --> 02:13:33,260
Any objections?

2775
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:35,980
Equips the gun, puts on her crazy face.

2776
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:39,460
None at all!

2777
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:42,580
I'd really appreciate it if you could provide backup on the communicator again.

2778
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:43,700
Wait a minute...

2779
02:13:44,820 --> 02:13:45,980
Wait a minute...

2780
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:51,580
Rinko-chan, are you okay?

2781
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:53,840
Are you sure it's okay for you to be up and moving already?

2782
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:54,640
Yes.

2783
02:13:55,180 --> 02:13:56,380
I think I'm fine now.

2784
02:13:57,420 --> 02:14:00,200
I feel like my body is lighter than before.

2785
02:14:00,920 --> 02:14:01,800
I feel fine.

2786
02:14:02,020 --> 02:14:04,900
In fact, I feel lighter than ever if I'm being honest.

2787
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:06,160
Anyway, Nagisa.

2788
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:10,260
You were trying to do something dangerous again, weren't you?

2789
02:14:10,540 --> 02:14:10,940
No...

2790
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:15,160
Nagisa, were you trying to do something risky all by yourself again?

2791
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:18,720
Weren't... Oh, you were trying to do... trying to do something risky all by yourself again.

2792
02:14:18,740 --> 02:14:19,120
Weren't you?

2793
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:20,480
Weren't you?

2794
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:23,020
You heard me?

2795
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:24,340
Why is the music so ominous?

2796
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:28,820
I heard you.

2797
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:32,760
I was trying to listen in, but your voice was just as loud as ever.

2798
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:38,260
Nagisa, please don't do anything reckless by yourself.

2799
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:40,200
Please don't do anything reckless by yourself?

2800
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:41,280
Okay, then come with me!

2801
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:43,360
But I can fight zombies!

2802
02:14:44,780 --> 02:14:45,520
There are people I can save!

2803
02:14:47,780 --> 02:14:48,820
But I can fight zombies!

2804
02:14:48,820 --> 02:14:48,820
There are people I can save!

2805
02:14:48,820 --> 02:14:50,180
But I'm the only one that can fight the zombies!

2806
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:52,540
And there might be others out there that I can save!

2807
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:53,300
I know.

2808
02:14:55,140 --> 02:14:55,680
That's why.

2809
02:14:56,180 --> 02:14:57,280
Oh, that's why?

2810
02:14:57,900 --> 02:14:59,780
Which is why I was thinking...

2811
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:04,260
I'll go with you.

2812
02:15:14,390 --> 02:15:16,030
I'll go along with you.

2813
02:15:17,570 --> 02:15:18,710
Wait, Rinka-chan?

2814
02:15:20,270 --> 02:15:21,250
How did you get that gun?

2815
02:15:22,170 --> 02:15:23,290
How did you get that gun?

2816
02:15:25,370 --> 02:15:26,230
It's too cool.

2817
02:15:26,390 --> 02:15:26,990
I know, right?

2818
02:15:27,590 --> 02:15:28,850
I love the katana, too.

2819
02:15:29,850 --> 02:15:31,250
The weaponry should have been locked.

2820
02:15:31,530 --> 02:15:32,430
The security seems to be weak.

2821
02:15:34,570 --> 02:15:36,530
If you mess with the lock a little, you'll be able to get it out.

2822
02:15:37,510 --> 02:15:38,670
She picked the lock?

2823
02:15:38,870 --> 02:15:40,330
The security isn't all that tight.

2824
02:15:40,490 --> 02:15:42,530
I just played around with the lock a little and voila.

2825
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:44,630
If I have this, I can fight zombies.

2826
02:15:46,410 --> 02:15:48,630
Besides, my body that has overcome the virus...

2827
02:15:48,630 --> 02:15:51,550
My body is the same as Nagisa's, right?

2828
02:15:53,110 --> 02:15:54,930
But with this, I can fight against them, too.

2829
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:56,610
And my body is like Nagisa's, right?

2830
02:15:56,710 --> 02:15:58,150
I was infected, too, after all.

2831
02:16:02,630 --> 02:16:04,750
Why was there... Where did she...

2832
02:16:04,750 --> 02:16:06,650
Okay, but where did Kanon get all these weapons?

2833
02:16:07,030 --> 02:16:08,270
And just stored them here?

2834
02:16:08,850 --> 02:16:10,430
You even read my science reports.

2835
02:16:10,770 --> 02:16:12,250
You're a lot more cunning than you look.

2836
02:16:15,830 --> 02:16:16,990
I'll take that as a compliment.

2837
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:18,610
I'll take that as a compliment.

2838
02:16:18,610 --> 02:16:19,330
Wait a minute!

2839
02:16:20,170 --> 02:16:21,490
Rika-chan is fighting a zombie...

2840
02:16:22,310 --> 02:16:23,310
Are you serious?

2841
02:16:23,570 --> 02:16:25,050
Stop asking questions.

2842
02:16:25,210 --> 02:16:25,590
Okay, I'm sorry.

2843
02:16:26,110 --> 02:16:28,290
Are you seriously planning on fighting zombies?

2844
02:16:28,650 --> 02:16:29,410
That's what I'm thinking.

2845
02:16:31,230 --> 02:16:31,710
Maybe...

2846
02:16:32,390 --> 02:16:33,470
I can't rely on you?

2847
02:16:36,850 --> 02:16:37,690
That's the plan.

2848
02:16:37,890 --> 02:16:39,290
Or are you saying I'd be in the way?

2849
02:16:39,550 --> 02:16:40,310
That's not true!

2850
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:42,870
Rather, it's very reliable.

2851
02:16:44,590 --> 02:16:45,070
But...

2852
02:16:45,070 --> 02:16:48,370
Even though it's the end of the world, I don't want you to be so reckless.

2853
02:16:49,930 --> 02:16:50,750
Not at all.

2854
02:16:50,950 --> 02:16:52,610
I'd feel better if I had you with me.

2855
02:16:52,730 --> 02:16:54,510
I just don't want to put you in danger.

2856
02:16:54,830 --> 02:16:55,510
I told you.

2857
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:57,470
I'm in the same body as you.

2858
02:16:58,670 --> 02:17:00,310
You don't need to worry about me.

2859
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:02,530
My body is the same as yours now.

2860
02:17:02,630 --> 02:17:03,830
There's no need to worry about me.

2861
02:17:03,930 --> 02:17:06,190
Besides, Nagisa is a little clumsy.

2862
02:17:07,370 --> 02:17:09,390
If you don't keep an eye on her, I'll be worried.

2863
02:17:11,210 --> 02:17:12,950
Besides, you're quite the klutz, Nagisa.

2864
02:17:13,150 --> 02:17:15,010
I'd feel more nervous leaving you all alone.

2865
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:15,890
Thank you, Mint.

2866
02:17:16,150 --> 02:17:22,270
I don't think I'm that much of a klutz.

2867
02:17:22,610 --> 02:17:25,130
I don't think I'm that much of a klutz.

2868
02:17:27,090 --> 02:17:28,150
Do you remember how many plates you broke at work?

2869
02:17:28,150 --> 02:17:28,730
I remember you spilling ketchup on your own.

2870
02:17:28,730 --> 02:17:31,390
And then...

2871
02:17:31,390 --> 02:17:31,450
And then...

2872
02:17:32,330 --> 02:17:35,990
Do you remember how many plates you broke at the cafe?

2873
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:36,330
Do you remember how many plates you broke at the cafe?

2874
02:17:36,330 --> 02:17:39,290
You even squirted ketchup in a customer's face by accident.

2875
02:17:39,470 --> 02:17:40,430
Not to mention.

2876
02:17:40,890 --> 02:17:42,090
I know!

2877
02:17:42,530 --> 02:17:43,150
I know!

2878
02:17:51,620 --> 02:17:53,140
You don't need to say all that in front of Kanon!

2879
02:17:56,860 --> 02:17:58,440
Sorry, I got a little carried away.

2880
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:02,680
Yeah, let's go.

2881
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:03,900
I'm ready to play the game.

2882
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:05,820
Let's get going.

2883
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,580
There's people out there that need our help.

2884
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:09,340
Yes!

2885
02:18:12,740 --> 02:18:14,280
Add her to the little menu.

2886
02:18:17,380 --> 02:18:18,500
You can now deploy.

2887
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:21,980
Hairpin.

2888
02:18:23,780 --> 02:18:25,260
Sub-story, nice.

2889
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:29,300
Hold on before we do this.

2890
02:18:45,270 --> 02:18:47,250
She gets so angry.

2891
02:18:50,090 --> 02:18:50,830
Sorry, sorry.

2892
02:19:01,570 --> 02:19:01,970
Okay.

2893
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:05,670
Let's go to the workshop.

2894
02:19:08,910 --> 02:19:10,290
And upgrade stuff.

2895
02:19:12,070 --> 02:19:13,890
So how do I change...

2896
02:19:13,890 --> 02:19:14,790
Oh, wait.

2897
02:19:14,870 --> 02:19:16,370
How do I change now to...

2898
02:19:16,370 --> 02:19:16,790
Oh, there we go.

2899
02:19:17,170 --> 02:19:17,570
Perfect.

2900
02:19:18,510 --> 02:19:20,470
So let's upgrade...

2901
02:19:21,490 --> 02:19:23,290
How much money do I have?

2902
02:19:23,430 --> 02:19:24,010
Oh, 8,000.

2903
02:19:24,030 --> 02:19:24,410
Okay, perfect.

2904
02:19:27,290 --> 02:19:28,710
Let's upgrade her a couple times.

2905
02:19:31,390 --> 02:19:32,610
We need more fiber.

2906
02:19:33,690 --> 02:19:34,370
Sniper rifle.

2907
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:39,630
Nice.

2908
02:19:41,530 --> 02:19:42,970
I don't remember what... Hold on.

2909
02:19:45,010 --> 02:19:45,930
Four, five...

2910
02:19:47,050 --> 02:19:48,430
How can I get...

2911
02:19:49,510 --> 02:19:50,430
Change accessory.

2912
02:19:50,970 --> 02:19:51,930
Yeah, we have none.

2913
02:19:52,550 --> 02:19:53,770
Let's see if we can buy anything.

2914
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:55,210
We said we could buy a hairpin, right?

2915
02:19:55,370 --> 02:19:55,630
Whoa!

2916
02:19:56,170 --> 02:19:56,630
Accessory...

2917
02:19:57,810 --> 02:19:59,350
Special Arcana brand chip.

2918
02:19:59,710 --> 02:20:01,070
Increases power and point growth.

2919
02:20:03,150 --> 02:20:03,870
It's expensive.

2920
02:20:08,730 --> 02:20:09,090
20k.

2921
02:20:13,570 --> 02:20:14,210
Here we go.

2922
02:20:16,390 --> 02:20:17,570
How much money did I have?

2923
02:20:17,870 --> 02:20:18,630
3,000?

2924
02:20:18,690 --> 02:20:18,870
Okay.

2925
02:20:19,270 --> 02:20:20,310
That should be good for now.

2926
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:23,330
Yeah, we're gonna have to save up.

2927
02:20:23,390 --> 02:20:24,330
We're gonna have to save up, baby.

2928
02:20:24,570 --> 02:20:26,530
Oh my gosh, I can't wait till our maid cafe is full.

2929
02:20:26,910 --> 02:20:27,730
It's gonna be so cute.

2930
02:20:27,830 --> 02:20:27,990
Okay.

2931
02:20:28,190 --> 02:20:28,810
I'm excited.

2932
02:20:28,810 --> 02:20:31,050
Oh gosh, I can't wait to see who the next girl is.

2933
02:20:31,270 --> 02:20:31,710
Idle!

2934
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:37,150
Idle?

2935
02:20:45,540 --> 02:20:45,980
Minto.

2936
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:47,920
Rinka got a PSG-1.

2937
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:49,760
Hurry and save Meryl.

2938
02:20:52,900 --> 02:20:53,480
Confirm deployment.

2939
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:54,300
Yeah!

2940
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:58,760
So I think this one is just survive for five minutes?

2941
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:00,420
Wait, where is...

2942
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:02,960
Where is she?

2943
02:21:03,720 --> 02:21:04,460
Oh my god.

2944
02:21:05,060 --> 02:21:05,760
They got...

2945
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:07,820
The zombies have knives now.

2946
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:08,960
Are these cosplayers?

2947
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:14,240
Oh, I forgot to swap.

2948
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:21,280
I thought that they would both be able to come out at once.

2949
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:22,260
Aw, man.

2950
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:27,040
But it said that they were both required.

2951
02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:31,950
Hmm.

2952
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:34,610
Space.

2953
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:41,280
Oh, this looks like the end of the map.

2954
02:21:45,460 --> 02:21:46,000
Nice.

2955
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:48,580
Missile?

2956
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:49,260
Oh my gosh.

2957
02:21:49,320 --> 02:21:49,500
Wait.

2958
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:50,760
What was the miniature missile?

2959
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:53,400
Look how cute the sprites are.

2960
02:21:53,540 --> 02:21:54,580
They're so cute.

2961
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:57,260
What was that sound?

2962
02:21:57,460 --> 02:21:58,920
Oh, my special is ready.

2963
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:02,100
Oh, this is a smaller map, actually.

2964
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:06,360
We'll do the...

2965
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:08,500
Oh, auto heal or magnetic field.

2966
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:08,940
Let's do it.

2967
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:11,620
Hmm.

2968
02:22:15,470 --> 02:22:16,050
Yes!

2969
02:22:17,110 --> 02:22:18,030
Magnetic field!

2970
02:22:19,110 --> 02:22:20,150
La la la.

2971
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:25,310
Yeah.

2972
02:22:25,850 --> 02:22:26,970
I'm still slow.

2973
02:22:27,130 --> 02:22:27,990
I'm still so slow.

2974
02:22:29,810 --> 02:22:33,370
I like the incendiary garlic.

2975
02:22:35,510 --> 02:22:36,870
I like these ones too.

2976
02:22:36,870 --> 02:22:39,410
Because they blow up and also leave a lasting.

2977
02:22:39,830 --> 02:22:40,510
You know?

2978
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:41,510
Oh!

2979
02:22:42,050 --> 02:22:42,550
Vacuum!

2980
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:51,560
Nice.

2981
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:56,220
Nice.

2982
02:22:59,100 --> 02:22:59,600
Vacuum.

2983
02:22:59,900 --> 02:23:00,400
Vacuum.

2984
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:01,060
Vacuum.

2985
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:03,500
Let's do it.

2986
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:05,580
Oh, that's why...

2987
02:23:05,580 --> 02:23:06,520
So they stay in place.

2988
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:09,040
So that's why they kind of like...

2989
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:10,400
don't hang around me.

2990
02:23:10,480 --> 02:23:12,160
And sometimes there will be places that are filmed.

2991
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:12,560
With hearts.

2992
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:13,100
And I'm like...

2993
02:23:13,100 --> 02:23:13,220
How?

2994
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:14,040
Why?

2995
02:23:34,170 --> 02:23:35,510
I'm trying to get these hearts in here.

2996
02:23:41,900 --> 02:23:42,180
Optimize!

2997
02:23:49,130 --> 02:23:49,410
Oh!

2998
02:23:49,770 --> 02:23:50,270
What did I do?

2999
02:23:50,270 --> 02:23:50,690
How did I get this?

3000
02:23:55,470 --> 02:23:57,170
I want the missiles to come back.

3001
02:23:57,290 --> 02:23:58,310
I want the missiles to come back.

3002
02:24:01,290 --> 02:24:02,390
What a waste.

3003
02:24:08,020 --> 02:24:08,420
Flamethrower.

3004
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:09,180
So nice.

3005
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:09,400
Oh!

3006
02:24:09,560 --> 02:24:11,520
I think I saw some otaku-chan!

3007
02:24:12,920 --> 02:24:13,320
Hello!

3008
02:24:13,460 --> 02:24:13,600
Oh!

3009
02:24:13,620 --> 02:24:14,100
There's a main too!

3010
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:15,160
Oh!

3011
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:17,680
Oh!

3012
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:19,200
They're coming out.

3013
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:19,640
They're coming out.

3014
02:24:24,260 --> 02:24:24,660
Oh!

3015
02:24:24,820 --> 02:24:25,000
Oh!

3016
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:25,780
There's a big girl!

3017
02:24:25,860 --> 02:24:26,520
There's a big girl!

3018
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:27,300
There's a big girl!

3019
02:24:28,980 --> 02:24:29,340
Oh!

3020
02:24:32,140 --> 02:24:33,240
I keep getting hurt.

3021
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:33,820
My bad.

3022
02:24:34,400 --> 02:24:35,820
I don't even know my own...

3023
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:37,920
My own hitbox, I guess.

3024
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:39,580
Don't get hurt!

3025
02:24:39,800 --> 02:24:39,920
Oh!

3026
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:40,480
Nice, nice, nice.

3027
02:24:51,590 --> 02:24:53,750
And I have my special if I need to use it.

3028
02:24:55,730 --> 02:24:56,550
I haven't forgotten.

3029
02:24:57,630 --> 02:24:57,990
Oh!

3030
02:24:58,090 --> 02:24:58,770
What the hell?

3031
02:24:58,810 --> 02:24:59,550
What is my hitbox?

3032
02:25:04,210 --> 02:25:04,570
Grenade!

3033
02:25:04,610 --> 02:25:04,970
Grenade!

3034
02:25:05,070 --> 02:25:05,270
Grenade!

3035
02:25:05,330 --> 02:25:05,690
Grenade!

3036
02:25:05,710 --> 02:25:06,570
Sensor.

3037
02:25:07,030 --> 02:25:07,750
More drones!

3038
02:25:10,570 --> 02:25:11,790
I just noticed a friend.

3039
02:25:12,010 --> 02:25:12,970
Yeah, she's helping us out.

3040
02:25:13,210 --> 02:25:13,770
She's so cute.

3041
02:25:13,950 --> 02:25:14,930
Oh my god, there's so many otaku.

3042
02:25:16,030 --> 02:25:16,510
Otaku!

3043
02:25:18,310 --> 02:25:18,790
Otaku!

3044
02:25:18,990 --> 02:25:19,470
Otaku!

3045
02:25:19,470 --> 02:25:19,810
Otaku!

3046
02:25:19,810 --> 02:25:20,070
Oh!

3047
02:25:20,170 --> 02:25:20,850
Miniature missile!

3048
02:25:22,870 --> 02:25:23,910
Let's see how this works.

3049
02:25:25,110 --> 02:25:26,010
I'm so curious.

3050
02:25:33,480 --> 02:25:34,380
Homing bullet!

3051
02:25:35,340 --> 02:25:35,820
Oh!

3052
02:25:37,940 --> 02:25:39,360
All the designs are so cute.

3053
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:40,080
I know, right?

3054
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:41,220
Oh!

3055
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:42,820
Oh!

3056
02:25:42,820 --> 02:25:43,200
Oh!

3057
02:25:43,260 --> 02:25:44,340
I was pressing...

3058
02:25:44,340 --> 02:25:44,440
Oh!

3059
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:45,960
I don't think I have any more bullets left.

3060
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:48,740
For support mages.

3061
02:25:49,240 --> 02:25:49,720
Okay.

3062
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:52,400
I'll have to make more.

3063
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:56,420
I'll have to make more support mages.

3064
02:25:59,120 --> 02:26:01,780
I mean, more bullets for support mages.

3065
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:04,040
Take a...

3066
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:07,140
Yay!

3067
02:26:08,780 --> 02:26:09,260
Oh!

3068
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:10,880
Oh!

3069
02:26:11,160 --> 02:26:11,300
Oh!

3070
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:12,240
On

3071
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:18,960
the way.

3072
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:19,380
On the way.

3073
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:20,880
I need to get more hearts.

3074
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:23,340
I need to get more hearts.

3075
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:25,000
Please.

3076
02:26:25,100 --> 02:26:25,520
Please move.

3077
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:28,120
Left

3078
02:26:31,220 --> 02:26:32,080
click does the melee?

3079
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:32,620
Oh!

3080
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:34,000
You looked it up!

3081
02:26:34,220 --> 02:26:34,820
Oh my gosh!

3082
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:35,280
Thank you!

3083
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:36,600
Oh my gosh!

3084
02:26:36,620 --> 02:26:36,920
You're right!

3085
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:38,120
Oh!

3086
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:38,560
Oh!

3087
02:26:38,600 --> 02:26:38,840
Okay.

3088
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:39,360
But there's a...

3089
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:39,740
There's a...

3090
02:26:39,740 --> 02:26:40,900
There's a slowdown on it.

3091
02:26:40,940 --> 02:26:41,080
Okay.

3092
02:26:41,160 --> 02:26:41,320
Okay.

3093
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:42,580
So if I'm like...

3094
02:26:42,580 --> 02:26:42,900
Oh!

3095
02:26:43,820 --> 02:26:44,540
Thank you!

3096
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:48,180
Oh my god.

3097
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:48,600
Mid!

3098
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:49,360
Mid!

3099
02:26:49,980 --> 02:26:50,340
Mid!

3100
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:50,860
Mid!

3101
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:54,960
Get him, I...

3102
02:26:54,960 --> 02:26:55,400
Get him...

3103
02:26:55,400 --> 02:26:55,580
Ah!

3104
02:26:58,870 --> 02:26:59,350
Get...

3105
02:26:59,350 --> 02:26:59,770
Oh my god.

3106
02:26:59,790 --> 02:27:00,430
This guy has...

3107
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:01,230
Pant lights!

3108
02:27:04,770 --> 02:27:06,710
Oh, I think we lost our mid.

3109
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:12,680
I think we lost our mid maybe.

3110
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:13,560
Oh no.

3111
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:15,120
Oh no.

3112
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:20,800
Okay, now we know how to fight.

3113
02:27:22,380 --> 02:27:23,460
Oh my goodness.

3114
02:27:24,220 --> 02:27:25,620
Let's increase the strength of this.

3115
02:27:25,820 --> 02:27:26,120
Oh!

3116
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:26,940
This is perfect.

3117
02:27:27,100 --> 02:27:27,880
Perfect timing.

3118
02:27:28,100 --> 02:27:28,440
Oh!

3119
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:29,120
Perfect timing!

3120
02:27:29,580 --> 02:27:30,380
Oh yeah!

3121
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:31,620
Perfect timing, baby!

3122
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:32,800
Perfect timing!

3123
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:34,620
Why are the mids so much stronger now?

3124
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:36,820
There's another one right here.

3125
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:41,060
Cool down.

3126
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:45,360
What did I just get?

3127
02:27:50,670 --> 02:27:51,110
Speed.

3128
02:27:57,760 --> 02:28:00,300
There was some more stuff up here, but...

3129
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:02,040
Um...

3130
02:28:05,610 --> 02:28:06,050
More...

3131
02:28:06,050 --> 02:28:07,910
Let's increase our drones-ness.

3132
02:28:08,850 --> 02:28:09,530
Oh my gosh.

3133
02:28:09,850 --> 02:28:10,290
Wee!

3134
02:28:10,390 --> 02:28:10,830
Wee!

3135
02:28:10,850 --> 02:28:11,010
Wee!

3136
02:28:11,030 --> 02:28:11,150
Wee!

3137
02:28:11,250 --> 02:28:11,330
Wee!

3138
02:28:11,330 --> 02:28:11,570
Wee!

3139
02:28:11,590 --> 02:28:12,370
Oh, gosh.

3140
02:28:12,470 --> 02:28:12,650
Oh,

3141
02:28:17,750 --> 02:28:18,930
they're really starting to get stronger.

3142
02:28:20,770 --> 02:28:22,450
You guys are taking damage!

3143
02:28:22,730 --> 02:28:23,310
Uh-oh.

3144
02:28:24,050 --> 02:28:27,570
Oh, we made it.

3145
02:28:32,330 --> 02:28:32,810
No!

3146
02:28:35,420 --> 02:28:36,540
I took damage!

3147
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:38,680
Oh

3148
02:28:44,460 --> 02:28:44,640
no!

3149
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:49,200
I took too much damage.

3150
02:28:52,380 --> 02:28:53,420
Where were you?

3151
02:28:53,880 --> 02:28:54,600
Stunned the fuck out of me.

3152
02:28:54,600 --> 02:28:55,320
The fight is finally over.

3153
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:07,940
Oh yeah, it totally looked like you knew what you were doing out there.

3154
02:29:17,010 --> 02:29:17,890
Her face.

3155
02:29:19,990 --> 02:29:21,450
I don't think it was anything special.

3156
02:29:32,670 --> 02:29:36,590
I was totally surprised at how calm and collected you were despite everything.

3157
02:29:37,550 --> 02:29:38,950
She looks so...

3158
02:29:44,170 --> 02:29:47,390
Did you used to be a mercenary by any chance?

3159
02:29:50,010 --> 02:29:50,530
Ooh,

3160
02:29:54,390 --> 02:29:55,950
it sounds like something out of a manga, huh?

3161
02:29:56,050 --> 02:29:58,930
Stories about ex-mercenaries are pretty popular now, aren't they?

3162
02:30:01,270 --> 02:30:02,670
Is this a gacha game?

3163
02:30:02,770 --> 02:30:03,390
No, it's not.

3164
02:30:03,490 --> 02:30:04,330
It's not a gacha game.

3165
02:30:05,350 --> 02:30:07,910
You know that I'm just a regular college student, Nagisa.

3166
02:30:13,490 --> 02:30:14,010
FPS.

3167
02:30:17,410 --> 02:30:20,010
Though I guess I have pretty good hand-eye coordination.

3168
02:30:20,410 --> 02:30:22,310
I mean, I'm pretty into shooter games.

3169
02:30:22,690 --> 02:30:23,710
She's a gamer!

3170
02:30:24,770 --> 02:30:26,430
You like video games?

3171
02:30:27,310 --> 02:30:29,110
You like video games?

3172
02:30:30,890 --> 02:30:31,130
Yeah, I'm a gamer!

3173
02:30:31,730 --> 02:30:34,850
I'm a gamer after all!

3174
02:30:41,670 --> 02:30:42,230
Nagisa.

3175
02:30:43,030 --> 02:30:44,310
Oh, I'm sorry!

3176
02:30:44,830 --> 02:30:46,690
Come to think of it, this was a secret.

3177
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:49,770
I see.

3178
02:30:53,950 --> 02:30:56,570
I'm not that familiar with the game, but...

3179
02:30:56,570 --> 02:30:58,030
I guess that's why it became a battle simulation.

3180
02:30:58,710 --> 02:30:59,470
She's a gamer.

3181
02:31:00,210 --> 02:31:01,010
She's a gamer.

3182
02:31:01,010 --> 02:31:02,770
Yeah, she's probably a VTuber.

3183
02:31:03,630 --> 02:31:06,690
I don't know too much about video games, but it seems to be an effective...

3184
02:31:06,690 --> 02:31:08,670
An effective tool?

3185
02:31:10,050 --> 02:31:11,950
It seems to be effective also?

3186
02:31:14,750 --> 02:31:15,190
Tool?

3187
02:31:16,610 --> 02:31:17,050
Tool?

3188
02:31:18,990 --> 02:31:21,950
It seems to be an effective tool for preparing to fight?

3189
02:31:25,610 --> 02:31:26,990
In the end, it's a game.

3190
02:31:27,470 --> 02:31:30,290
It's a different story if you don't actually move.

3191
02:31:31,090 --> 02:31:33,710
If you don't have enough physical strength, you won't be able to fight.

3192
02:31:35,750 --> 02:31:38,610
But game skills don't equate to real-life skills necessarily.

3193
02:31:38,930 --> 02:31:40,810
For starters, I can't fight if I don't have enough stamina.

3194
02:31:41,330 --> 02:31:44,050
Even so, you have enough fighting ability.

3195
02:31:45,010 --> 02:31:48,370
I think you've gotten used to being an excellent soldier without any reinforcement.

3196
02:31:49,970 --> 02:31:51,390
I'm surprised some of these...

3197
02:31:51,390 --> 02:31:53,150
This game isn't so new.

3198
02:31:54,050 --> 02:31:57,450
So I'm surprised some of these haven't been patched out.

3199
02:32:00,670 --> 02:32:02,050
Proofreading wasn't in the budget.

3200
02:32:05,230 --> 02:32:05,750
Please.

3201
02:32:06,330 --> 02:32:06,850
Curate.

3202
02:32:07,150 --> 02:32:07,990
I will...

3203
02:32:07,990 --> 02:32:09,770
I will playtest your games.

3204
02:32:09,890 --> 02:32:10,150
Please.

3205
02:32:11,070 --> 02:32:13,350
Even though I missed Desperati earlier.

3206
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:18,190
Those skills seem to have done you some good.

3207
02:32:18,410 --> 02:32:18,890
Even...

3208
02:32:18,890 --> 02:32:20,570
And even without being infected.

3209
02:32:20,570 --> 02:32:22,530
You probably had the potential to be a good fighter.

3210
02:32:29,070 --> 02:32:29,690
Oh yeah.

3211
02:32:30,070 --> 02:32:31,070
I'm sure that's a compliment.

3212
02:32:31,210 --> 02:32:33,030
But I don't know if I'm particularly happy about it.

3213
02:32:39,910 --> 02:32:41,170
A little more palette swap.

3214
02:32:41,430 --> 02:32:44,050
Or other differences between the support maids and the zombie maids.

3215
02:32:44,230 --> 02:32:45,350
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3216
02:32:45,630 --> 02:32:47,730
For me, sometimes it is hard to see them.

3217
02:32:47,750 --> 02:32:48,570
Especially like...

3218
02:32:49,430 --> 02:32:51,570
Yeah, I do agree though.

3219
02:32:51,690 --> 02:32:53,250
Maybe they could have like...

3220
02:32:53,250 --> 02:32:54,090
Sort of like...

3221
02:32:54,090 --> 02:32:55,630
Maybe a red outline or something.

3222
02:32:55,770 --> 02:32:56,650
So you can see them better.

3223
02:32:57,070 --> 02:32:57,910
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

3224
02:32:58,750 --> 02:33:00,750
Speaking of questions, I have one for you actually.

3225
02:33:01,130 --> 02:33:01,390
Oh.

3226
02:33:01,510 --> 02:33:02,010
Kano.

3227
02:33:04,110 --> 02:33:05,870
Who are you exactly?

3228
02:33:06,190 --> 02:33:06,650
Ohh...

3229
02:33:07,290 --> 02:33:07,790
Kano...

3230
02:33:07,790 --> 02:33:09,030
Who are you exactly?

3231
02:33:09,430 --> 02:33:10,530
Oh, that!

3232
02:33:10,990 --> 02:33:12,910
I was a little worried about that too.

3233
02:33:13,130 --> 02:33:14,710
I was holding a gun...

3234
02:33:14,710 --> 02:33:16,370
But I feel like I'm definitely not a normal person.

3235
02:33:18,430 --> 02:33:19,910
Hmm... I was wondering that too.

3236
02:33:20,110 --> 02:33:23,050
You have access to guns, so there's no way you're just some regular civilian.

3237
02:33:32,910 --> 02:33:33,630
The mystery...

3238
02:33:34,110 --> 02:33:37,570
I'm very thankful that you saved me, but I don't think I can fully trust you at this point.

3239
02:33:46,370 --> 02:33:49,910
And how were you able to make a vaccine in a modified made calf?

3240
02:33:51,870 --> 02:33:54,130
So this is... I know what's happening here.

3241
02:33:55,090 --> 02:33:57,990
The... It's supposed to be the E with the little...

3242
02:33:59,770 --> 02:34:02,070
The little like... blip!

3243
02:34:02,470 --> 02:34:08,150
On top of it, but I think the... it didn't read it, so it made into a question mark.

3244
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:13,640
No special characters, yeah.

3245
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:15,160
E with a hat.

3246
02:34:15,460 --> 02:34:16,540
No, it doesn't have a hat.

3247
02:34:16,780 --> 02:34:17,760
It has a little...

3248
02:34:18,580 --> 02:34:19,020
Blip!

3249
02:34:20,040 --> 02:34:21,100
Of all places.

3250
02:34:27,740 --> 02:34:29,620
Oh... I wasn't trying to hide anything.

3251
02:34:29,900 --> 02:34:32,640
I just didn't feel like there was an appropriate time to explain everything.

3252
02:34:32,860 --> 02:34:33,380
Come on!

3253
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:34,640
We have another girl to save!

3254
02:34:34,940 --> 02:34:36,080
We can talk about it later.

3255
02:34:40,260 --> 02:34:40,700
Oh?

3256
02:34:43,300 --> 02:34:44,080
Uh oh...

3257
02:34:47,900 --> 02:34:49,000
An ahoge.

3258
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:50,320
Yeah, an ahoge.

3259
02:34:50,560 --> 02:34:51,780
The E has an ahoge.

3260
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:56,220
I'm no... Rinka, your suspicions are correct.

3261
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:58,800
I'm no... I am no regular person.

3262
02:34:59,020 --> 02:35:02,300
What's more, I'm not entirely unrelated to this pandemic either.

3263
02:35:02,660 --> 02:35:03,640
Can you tell me more about it?

3264
02:35:04,140 --> 02:35:04,720
Oh...

3265
02:35:05,700 --> 02:35:06,280
Elaborate.

3266
02:35:06,360 --> 02:35:07,100
What do you mean?

3267
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:11,820
Before that...

3268
02:35:11,820 --> 02:35:13,400
First of all, I need to tell you about the pandemic.

3269
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:16,260
I need to tell you about the MADS virus.

3270
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:18,280
I need to tell you about the MADS virus.

3271
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:21,920
To better understand, I'll have to tell you about the MADS virus.

3272
02:35:22,320 --> 02:35:24,180
Which is the cause of this pandemic.

3273
02:35:24,920 --> 02:35:28,500
This virus was originally a secret research facility of the company Arcana Industries.

3274
02:35:32,840 --> 02:35:35,120
Wait, didn't it say the hairpin was Arcana?

3275
02:35:36,940 --> 02:35:41,900
The virus was originally developed in secret by a company called Arcana Industries.

3276
02:35:43,700 --> 02:35:44,260
MADS...

3277
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:45,880
MADS Nicholson.

3278
02:35:45,880 --> 02:35:47,320
It's a very famous company, isn't it?

3279
02:35:47,380 --> 02:35:47,680
Yeah.

3280
02:35:48,120 --> 02:35:50,260
I heard that they were developing a zombie virus.

3281
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:55,460
Arcana... Aren't they like a globally famous company?

3282
02:35:55,700 --> 02:35:57,840
They're the ones who developed some zombie virus?

3283
02:35:58,200 --> 02:35:59,580
That's what you mean.

3284
02:36:00,380 --> 02:36:01,140
That's right.

3285
02:36:01,460 --> 02:36:03,440
I was involved in the research of this virus in the Arcana Industries.

3286
02:36:07,080 --> 02:36:08,520
I was a former researcher.

3287
02:36:09,660 --> 02:36:13,860
I'm an ex-researcher who was working on the development of the virus at Arcana Industries.

3288
02:36:13,860 --> 02:36:15,160
An ex-researcher?

3289
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:16,560
You're that young?

3290
02:36:17,060 --> 02:36:19,080
Are you still in junior high or high school?

3291
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:22,780
But you look so young.

3292
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:24,280
How are you a researcher?

3293
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:26,520
I thought you were in middle school, maybe high school.

3294
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:28,340
I'm close to 30 years old.

3295
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:30,840
She's close to 30?

3296
02:36:34,040 --> 02:36:35,140
Oh my god.

3297
02:36:36,900 --> 02:36:37,900
No way.

3298
02:36:38,060 --> 02:36:39,360
You're older than me?

3299
02:36:39,660 --> 02:36:40,720
I was talking normally.

3300
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:42,920
I'm sorry.

3301
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:43,320
What is it?

3302
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:46,040
She's in demand.

3303
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:48,620
You're seriously older than me?

3304
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:50,800
I was acting so casual around you.

3305
02:36:50,940 --> 02:36:52,200
My apologies.

3306
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:55,660
It's hard to go back, so please do as you did before.

3307
02:36:57,100 --> 02:36:59,400
It's also because I didn't explain myself.

3308
02:37:01,900 --> 02:37:03,940
Please just keep speaking the way you have been.

3309
02:37:04,060 --> 02:37:05,900
It's my fault for not saying anything sooner.

3310
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:06,780
No way.

3311
02:37:07,800 --> 02:37:10,760
I didn't know you were involved in the research of the virus.

3312
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:14,340
I'll just ask you this.

3313
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:16,580
That's why you were able to make the vaccine, right?

3314
02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:22,040
I never would have thought that you'd be the one in charge of developing the virus.

3315
02:37:22,260 --> 02:37:23,820
Did all this happen because of you?

3316
02:37:24,180 --> 02:37:24,660
Yes.

3317
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:28,600
I was in charge of the research of the vaccine.

3318
02:37:29,740 --> 02:37:32,140
I was the one in charge of the research team.

3319
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:34,940
But there were a lot of things that happened.

3320
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:36,900
The research center was shut down.

3321
02:37:37,500 --> 02:37:40,460
There were some issues and I ended up being fired.

3322
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:46,940
Oh my god.

3323
02:37:47,360 --> 02:37:49,600
This is some kind of sick retaliation.

3324
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:52,640
This isn't some kind of sick retaliation for being fired, is it?

3325
02:37:53,180 --> 02:37:53,740
Rinka-chan!

3326
02:37:54,940 --> 02:37:56,440
No, it's not strange to be so suspicious.

3327
02:37:58,720 --> 02:38:02,140
At the time of the pandemic, I was visiting the research center to recover my personal belongings.

3328
02:38:04,380 --> 02:38:05,660
So how did it get out?

3329
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:07,700
I can see how you think that.

3330
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:10,280
However, when the pandemic started, I was still in the laboratory.

3331
02:38:10,720 --> 02:38:11,960
Packing up my belongings.

3332
02:38:12,180 --> 02:38:16,840
However, the researchers at the research center were already infected and became zombies.

3333
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:22,020
I hurriedly collected what I needed and left the place.

3334
02:38:23,400 --> 02:38:26,800
While I was still there, I started to notice the other researchers turning into zombies.

3335
02:38:27,100 --> 02:38:29,040
I grabbed the essentials and made a run for it.

3336
02:38:29,140 --> 02:38:30,180
You don't seem to be lying.

3337
02:38:30,980 --> 02:38:31,860
Like guns.

3338
02:38:34,940 --> 02:38:36,580
Well, you don't seem to be lying.

3339
02:38:36,820 --> 02:38:38,160
There is no merit in lying.

3340
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:44,760
My relationship with you is beneficial for the development of vaccines and the eradication of the pandemic.

3341
02:38:46,900 --> 02:38:48,060
There's no reason to.

3342
02:38:48,820 --> 02:38:49,780
Oh my god.

3343
02:38:50,540 --> 02:38:55,960
If I want to stop this pandemic and perfect the vaccine, it's important that we trust each other.

3344
02:38:56,260 --> 02:38:56,720
That's right.

3345
02:38:57,100 --> 02:38:58,400
Oh my gosh.

3346
02:38:58,480 --> 02:39:00,040
My inner thoughts.

3347
02:39:00,140 --> 02:39:01,280
I'm perfecting the virus.

3348
02:39:01,380 --> 02:39:02,480
I mean the vaccine.

3349
02:39:03,780 --> 02:39:04,520
Of course.

3350
02:39:04,620 --> 02:39:05,140
I didn't mean...

3351
02:39:05,140 --> 02:39:06,500
Friday and slip.

3352
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:11,860
I can't believe Mintz was actually a 5-inch-high researcher of maids the whole time.

3353
02:39:11,920 --> 02:39:12,860
What are you talking about?

3354
02:39:13,540 --> 02:39:15,500
Why am I only 5 inches?

3355
02:39:18,220 --> 02:39:20,260
Plus, you've already gone out of your way to save us.

3356
02:39:20,480 --> 02:39:21,020
That's right.

3357
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:22,360
Perfect the virus.

3358
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:24,960
Of course, I understood the danger of that virus.

3359
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:29,500
I think I also have a part of responsibility for what happened.

3360
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:36,960
Obviously, I understood the dangers of that virus.

3361
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:39,960
I take full responsibility for such a horrendous tragedy.

3362
02:39:46,060 --> 02:39:50,660
If only I had destroyed that virus after its highly toxic nature was discovered.

3363
02:39:51,220 --> 02:39:52,160
It's not your fault!

3364
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:56,050
You didn't do it!

3365
02:39:56,470 --> 02:39:57,990
No, I think it is her fault.

3366
02:39:58,150 --> 02:39:59,030
I think it is...

3367
02:39:59,530 --> 02:40:01,610
Nagisa, I think we're being a little too forgiving here.

3368
02:40:01,770 --> 02:40:02,650
I think so.

3369
02:40:02,750 --> 02:40:04,810
I think it is 100% her fault.

3370
02:40:09,610 --> 02:40:11,010
It's not your fault, Kanon.

3371
02:40:11,070 --> 02:40:13,590
No one could have imagined something like this would happen.

3372
02:40:13,870 --> 02:40:15,330
I mean, if you're researching...

3373
02:40:15,330 --> 02:40:17,350
If you're developing a virus...

3374
02:40:17,790 --> 02:40:18,230
Like...

3375
02:40:18,230 --> 02:40:19,330
Like this...

3376
02:40:20,930 --> 02:40:22,130
Kanon did nothing wrong.

3377
02:40:23,670 --> 02:40:25,270
If you call that a sin...

3378
02:40:25,270 --> 02:40:26,590
You have to atone for it.

3379
02:40:28,530 --> 02:40:29,410
For you...

3380
02:40:29,410 --> 02:40:32,110
That is the completion and mass production of the vaccine.

3381
02:40:36,110 --> 02:40:37,530
I can't stop you waiting.

3382
02:40:37,590 --> 02:40:38,550
I might need to go get some coffee.

3383
02:40:39,290 --> 02:40:41,010
If you really feel that it's your fault...

3384
02:40:41,010 --> 02:40:43,850
I guess the best way to make up for it would be to complete the vaccine, right?

3385
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:44,690
Yes.

3386
02:40:48,280 --> 02:40:49,020
Thank you for your cooperation.

3387
02:40:51,300 --> 02:40:52,320
Thank you for your cooperation.

3388
02:40:52,680 --> 02:40:54,360
For that, we'll be needing your help.

3389
02:40:54,580 --> 02:40:55,160
Of course!

3390
02:40:58,520 --> 02:40:58,920
Okay.

3391
02:41:01,180 --> 02:41:01,580
Nice.

3392
02:41:06,920 --> 02:41:08,360
Let's go get that idol girl.

3393
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:09,640
But first...

3394
02:41:09,640 --> 02:41:11,380
I think we need to...

3395
02:41:13,240 --> 02:41:14,140
Upgrade a little bit.

3396
02:41:18,440 --> 02:41:19,460
Oh, I need the fiber.

3397
02:41:21,220 --> 02:41:21,580
Wait!

3398
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:23,020
How did I do that?

3399
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:25,580
It said I had no fiber, right?

3400
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:26,800
Wait, how did I...

3401
02:41:26,800 --> 02:41:27,680
Oh, maybe I bought it?

3402
02:41:27,860 --> 02:41:28,060
Oh!

3403
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:28,560
Oops.

3404
02:41:29,160 --> 02:41:29,700
Oh my gosh.

3405
02:41:29,720 --> 02:41:32,940
I get the confirm and the go back buttons wrong.

3406
02:41:34,520 --> 02:41:35,880
Did it buy it for me?

3407
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:36,440
Oh.

3408
02:41:36,560 --> 02:41:37,360
I guess that's kinda...

3409
02:41:37,360 --> 02:41:38,540
I paid for it?

3410
02:41:38,660 --> 02:41:38,820
Oh!

3411
02:41:39,140 --> 02:41:40,060
I guess that's handy.

3412
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:44,600
And let's also...

3413
02:41:48,200 --> 02:41:48,960
We'll do one more?

3414
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:50,040
Nice.

3415
02:41:50,920 --> 02:41:51,280
Alright.

3416
02:41:53,900 --> 02:41:54,260
Strike.

3417
02:41:55,140 --> 02:41:57,020
It buys the needed things if you have the money.

3418
02:41:57,120 --> 02:41:57,300
Oh!

3419
02:41:57,480 --> 02:41:58,260
That's so handy.

3420
02:41:58,400 --> 02:41:59,440
So I don't have to go buy it myself.

3421
02:41:59,600 --> 02:41:59,960
Oh, nice.

3422
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:02,040
Only 8 more minutes.

3423
02:42:02,140 --> 02:42:02,320
Okay.

3424
02:42:02,380 --> 02:42:03,740
Let me go get my coffee real quick.

3425
02:42:05,240 --> 02:42:06,600
And then I will...

3426
02:42:07,060 --> 02:42:08,060
I already have it made.

3427
02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:10,320
So let me go get some...

3428
02:42:11,020 --> 02:42:11,860
Or maybe tea.

3429
02:42:11,980 --> 02:42:12,500
I don't know.

3430
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:13,580
I'll decide when I'm over there.

3431
02:42:14,220 --> 02:42:16,560
And then we'll do the next one.

3432
02:42:17,220 --> 02:42:18,360
Give me one second.

3433
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:18,920
I'll be right back.

3434
02:43:54,180 --> 02:43:56,520
I accidentally put in way too much creamer!

3435
02:43:56,880 --> 02:43:57,300
No!

3436
02:43:58,660 --> 02:43:59,080
No!

3437
02:43:59,120 --> 02:44:01,540
I accidentally put it way too much creamer!

3438
02:44:02,680 --> 02:44:03,920
It always had a nose.

3439
02:44:03,980 --> 02:44:04,940
Yeah, I was showing it off.

3440
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:05,740
Did you guys like it?

3441
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:07,040
You guys like my nose.

3442
02:44:09,160 --> 02:44:10,260
I got a package.

3443
02:44:11,500 --> 02:44:11,920
Hehe.

3444
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,880
It's some metal gear goods that I pre-ordered.

3445
02:44:17,980 --> 02:44:19,340
Oh, they're so cute!

3446
02:44:19,820 --> 02:44:23,360
I got some sticker sheets from someone off Etsy.

3447
02:44:23,460 --> 02:44:28,140
And they also had a cute little codec keychain that I got.

3448
02:44:30,120 --> 02:44:31,300
It knows where.

3449
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:32,520
Can't you see it?

3450
02:44:34,440 --> 02:44:35,700
Can you make your own coffee?

3451
02:44:35,800 --> 02:44:37,220
Yeah, I have a French press.

3452
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:41,140
That I use.

3453
02:44:42,260 --> 02:44:43,920
Oh my gosh, they're so cute.

3454
02:44:44,720 --> 02:44:45,840
They're so cute!

3455
02:44:51,930 --> 02:44:54,430
Another W for Godot and black coffee.

3456
02:44:54,650 --> 02:44:57,210
Oh yeah, it's way too much creamer.

3457
02:44:57,370 --> 02:44:59,990
It's basically milk at this point.

3458
02:45:09,360 --> 02:45:10,960
I messed up.

3459
02:45:11,180 --> 02:45:11,960
I messed up.

3460
02:45:14,180 --> 02:45:15,780
Okay, switch over!

3461
02:45:16,180 --> 02:45:17,260
And strike!

3462
02:45:23,160 --> 02:45:24,980
Oh, only 8 more minutes.

3463
02:45:28,940 --> 02:45:29,540
Okay.

3464
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:36,020
Oh, she... Okay, so she's really slow.

3465
02:45:37,160 --> 02:45:40,460
She's incredibly slow, but she hits multiple at a time.

3466
02:45:41,780 --> 02:45:43,420
She's so slow!

3467
02:45:44,780 --> 02:45:46,020
Oh my gosh.

3468
02:45:46,200 --> 02:45:46,960
Oh my gosh.

3469
02:45:50,700 --> 02:45:52,380
Let's... Let's do a grenade.

3470
02:45:53,800 --> 02:45:54,800
Looks like me!

3471
02:45:59,540 --> 02:46:02,340
See, but it takes out a good amount of enemies at a time!

3472
02:46:10,840 --> 02:46:11,280
Yeah.

3473
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:12,100
Take them out!

3474
02:46:16,240 --> 02:46:17,340
Take them out!

3475
02:46:17,560 --> 02:46:18,220
Take them out!

3476
02:46:18,340 --> 02:46:18,820
Take them out!

3477
02:46:19,780 --> 02:46:20,220
Nice.

3478
02:46:22,540 --> 02:46:23,340
Oh my gosh.

3479
02:46:23,460 --> 02:46:25,280
Okay, it's gonna take me a second to get used to this.

3480
02:46:25,700 --> 02:46:26,680
How was her melee?

3481
02:46:26,840 --> 02:46:27,400
The katana?

3482
02:46:28,140 --> 02:46:29,100
Let's do...

3483
02:46:30,040 --> 02:46:31,860
Increases close combat by 8%.

3484
02:46:32,560 --> 02:46:34,160
Additionally affects some skills.

3485
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:35,800
Let's try adding this.

3486
02:46:36,560 --> 02:46:37,340
Cause it's...

3487
02:46:37,340 --> 02:46:38,480
Oh wait, what was it?

3488
02:46:38,580 --> 02:46:39,000
Oh, left hit.

3489
02:46:39,100 --> 02:46:39,420
Right?

3490
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:42,960
But it's kind of...

3491
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:43,700
The...

3492
02:46:44,200 --> 02:46:45,820
I'm hoping the attack...

3493
02:46:46,340 --> 02:46:47,880
Will like, also help with...

3494
02:46:50,080 --> 02:46:50,920
With the...

3495
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:52,980
Cool down, right?

3496
02:46:53,220 --> 02:46:54,980
That's another thing we can get, is the cool down.

3497
02:46:56,680 --> 02:46:57,840
Let's do a magnum...

3498
02:46:57,840 --> 02:46:58,920
Well, actually we'll do the drone.

3499
02:47:03,750 --> 02:47:04,590
Trying to get...

3500
02:47:06,030 --> 02:47:06,470
Vacuum.

3501
02:47:06,510 --> 02:47:06,810
Vacuum.

3502
02:47:06,870 --> 02:47:07,310
Vacuum.

3503
02:47:08,490 --> 02:47:08,930
Vacuum...

3504
02:47:08,930 --> 02:47:10,530
Oh, we're not getting that vacuum, everybody.

3505
02:47:10,790 --> 02:47:12,010
What's her special skill?

3506
02:47:13,050 --> 02:47:13,490
Woo!

3507
02:47:14,850 --> 02:47:15,290
Wow!

3508
02:47:16,590 --> 02:47:17,270
Holy cow!

3509
02:47:17,850 --> 02:47:18,410
Oh, optimize.

3510
02:47:18,510 --> 02:47:18,850
Here we go.

3511
02:47:20,670 --> 02:47:21,610
Nice, nice, nice.

3512
02:47:23,150 --> 02:47:24,750
Let's do the slash support.

3513
02:47:26,430 --> 02:47:27,030
And...

3514
02:47:27,790 --> 02:47:28,710
Auto heal.

3515
02:47:29,710 --> 02:47:30,770
Cause I need that.

3516
02:47:32,850 --> 02:47:35,310
Yeah, the cool down is like so...

3517
02:47:35,310 --> 02:47:36,030
It takes so long.

3518
02:47:36,290 --> 02:47:37,090
Oh no, no, no!

3519
02:47:38,910 --> 02:47:40,150
Trying to get out of here.

3520
02:47:40,490 --> 02:47:41,250
Plus one drone.

3521
02:47:41,830 --> 02:47:43,270
More drones, please.

3522
02:47:45,230 --> 02:47:46,810
More drones, please.

3523
02:47:50,790 --> 02:47:52,790
I have to survive for eight minutes?

3524
02:47:54,870 --> 02:47:57,050
This is gonna suck, you guys.

3525
02:47:57,470 --> 02:47:58,910
This is really gonna suck.

3526
02:48:03,010 --> 02:48:04,590
I'm not good with the...

3527
02:48:05,710 --> 02:48:07,310
I'm not good with the...

3528
02:48:07,750 --> 02:48:08,570
What's it called at all?

3529
02:48:08,630 --> 02:48:09,050
The sniper.

3530
02:48:09,410 --> 02:48:10,730
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh!

3531
02:48:11,770 --> 02:48:12,650
Take him out!

3532
02:48:13,350 --> 02:48:15,970
Take him out!

3533
02:48:16,850 --> 02:48:17,410
Take him out!

3534
02:48:17,610 --> 02:48:17,790
Take him out!

3535
02:48:17,790 --> 02:48:18,730
Take him out!

3536
02:48:18,750 --> 02:48:19,190
Take him out!

3537
02:48:19,790 --> 02:48:20,490
I thought it would be...

3538
02:48:23,250 --> 02:48:24,130
That one.

3539
02:48:25,150 --> 02:48:25,590
Ganbare!

3540
02:48:28,930 --> 02:48:29,810
Whoa, nice.

3541
02:48:32,650 --> 02:48:33,430
Nice, nice.

3542
02:48:33,990 --> 02:48:35,170
Oh, there's some virus stuff.

3543
02:48:35,410 --> 02:48:36,010
Oh, that's right!

3544
02:48:36,130 --> 02:48:37,870
I have no bullets for the support maids.

3545
02:48:38,690 --> 02:48:39,870
So, we're on our...

3546
02:48:39,870 --> 02:48:42,270
I forgot to make more bullets for the support maids, you guys!

3547
02:48:42,330 --> 02:48:43,010
We're on our own!

3548
02:48:44,570 --> 02:48:45,710
We're on our own!

3549
02:48:49,590 --> 02:48:51,290
My CQC seems pretty decent.

3550
02:48:51,490 --> 02:48:51,710
Drill.

3551
02:48:52,150 --> 02:48:52,710
Drill, drill.

3552
02:48:53,950 --> 02:48:55,390
I'm sorry, fellow maid!

3553
02:48:58,790 --> 02:48:59,350
Let's see.

3554
02:49:03,920 --> 02:49:04,620
More drones.

3555
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:11,400
Nice.

3556
02:49:13,580 --> 02:49:14,020
Nice.

3557
02:49:14,080 --> 02:49:14,880
I want that.

3558
02:49:15,020 --> 02:49:15,380
Gimme that.

3559
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:15,860
Gimme that!

3560
02:49:17,100 --> 02:49:17,920
I'm being greedy.

3561
02:49:18,880 --> 02:49:19,600
But it's okay.

3562
02:49:21,180 --> 02:49:22,580
I'm being greedy, but it's okay.

3563
02:49:23,940 --> 02:49:24,640
I'll heal.

3564
02:49:24,800 --> 02:49:25,820
I heal a little bit.

3565
02:49:26,980 --> 02:49:28,020
And take him down!

3566
02:49:28,020 --> 02:49:28,160
Turn out!

3567
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:32,400
Oh, why does she do it sideways?

3568
02:49:32,680 --> 02:49:33,860
No, I was pointing it down!

3569
02:49:34,960 --> 02:49:37,800
Oh gosh, I thought, why does she only do it in one direction?

3570
02:49:38,900 --> 02:49:40,940
You don't know you're beautiful.

3571
02:49:41,880 --> 02:49:42,640
No, no.

3572
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:46,240
That's what makes you beautiful.

3573
02:49:46,900 --> 02:49:49,280
Okay, it's not super wide either.

3574
02:49:52,640 --> 02:49:53,720
It's only horizontal.

3575
02:49:57,900 --> 02:50:02,980
It might also be good to increase defense in certain things too.

3576
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:04,420
Oh gosh, I need all these hearts.

3577
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:05,880
Get out of my way!

3578
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:06,880
Oh gosh!

3579
02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:07,720
Oh gosh!

3580
02:50:07,800 --> 02:50:08,280
Oh gosh!

3581
02:50:08,320 --> 02:50:08,460
Oh gosh!

3582
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:15,100
Special skill turns plus one.

3583
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:16,920
What does that mean?

3584
02:50:19,640 --> 02:50:20,340
The idol!

3585
02:50:26,460 --> 02:50:27,120
There we go.

3586
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:27,480
Nice.

3587
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:29,740
Yeah!

3588
02:50:29,740 --> 02:50:31,920
It does really look like me, doesn't it?

3589
02:50:34,460 --> 02:50:35,160
I'd win.

3590
02:50:37,020 --> 02:50:37,500
Nice.

3591
02:50:38,780 --> 02:50:39,860
One extra charge.

3592
02:50:39,980 --> 02:50:40,380
Oh nice.

3593
02:50:45,930 --> 02:50:47,190
Let's do the magnetic field.

3594
02:50:47,370 --> 02:50:50,670
It's like a good passive to have, I think.

3595
02:50:52,910 --> 02:50:54,690
I think it's a good passive to have.

3596
02:50:56,530 --> 02:50:58,010
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

3597
02:51:00,290 --> 02:51:00,850
Nice.

3598
02:51:02,930 --> 02:51:04,230
Oh, nice, nice.

3599
02:51:04,410 --> 02:51:05,330
Let's get that vacuum.

3600
02:51:05,430 --> 02:51:06,090
Let's get that vacuum.

3601
02:51:10,050 --> 02:51:10,650
Nice.

3602
02:51:15,460 --> 02:51:17,440
My maid is a maid of justice.

3603
02:51:24,430 --> 02:51:25,030
Yeah.

3604
02:51:30,200 --> 02:51:30,800
Nice.

3605
02:51:37,960 --> 02:51:40,100
It's horizontal only, but it does go both.

3606
02:51:40,380 --> 02:51:41,140
Oh, jeez.

3607
02:51:41,260 --> 02:51:42,200
I didn't even realize.

3608
02:51:48,240 --> 02:51:48,680
Optimize.

3609
02:51:48,720 --> 02:51:49,400
Yeah, there we go.

3610
02:51:49,480 --> 02:51:49,940
Nice, nice.

3611
02:51:53,930 --> 02:51:54,530
Kill him!

3612
02:51:55,330 --> 02:51:55,990
Kill him!

3613
02:51:57,370 --> 02:51:58,090
Kill him!

3614
02:52:02,580 --> 02:52:03,240
Oh gosh.

3615
02:52:05,800 --> 02:52:06,240
Oh no!

3616
02:52:06,500 --> 02:52:06,980
Oh no!

3617
02:52:10,880 --> 02:52:11,280
Nice.

3618
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:14,420
I just took a little bit of damage there, but...

3619
02:52:14,420 --> 02:52:15,220
It's okay.

3620
02:52:16,060 --> 02:52:17,300
Or hit the end of the map.

3621
02:52:17,480 --> 02:52:18,480
I need more hearts!

3622
02:52:18,700 --> 02:52:19,700
Oh no, no, no!

3623
02:52:23,560 --> 02:52:24,700
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

3624
02:52:26,100 --> 02:52:27,400
Took a little bit of damage.

3625
02:52:28,280 --> 02:52:29,940
It's okay, I heal eventually.

3626
02:52:33,240 --> 02:52:33,640
Oh gosh.

3627
02:52:34,320 --> 02:52:40,380
When is my special?

3628
02:52:41,840 --> 02:52:43,760
I need more hearts.

3629
02:52:46,420 --> 02:52:47,860
Run faster.

3630
02:52:48,120 --> 02:52:49,040
I'm trying.

3631
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:53,400
Oh, all of these are new.

3632
02:52:55,980 --> 02:52:58,280
Might be good too.

3633
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:01,420
I'm out of special charges.

3634
02:53:10,810 --> 02:53:11,490
Let's just...

3635
02:53:11,490 --> 02:53:12,390
Wow, nice.

3636
02:53:20,800 --> 02:53:23,400
I thought the special would charge over time.

3637
02:53:24,140 --> 02:53:25,100
But it doesn't.

3638
02:53:25,140 --> 02:53:25,900
It's really sad.

3639
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:27,820
Makes me so sad.

3640
02:53:27,900 --> 02:53:28,920
Oh gosh, these guys are stronger.

3641
02:53:29,660 --> 02:53:31,600
Okay, there should be more hearts...

3642
02:53:32,100 --> 02:53:33,540
up here, you know?

3643
02:53:33,740 --> 02:53:35,220
When I killed people before.

3644
02:53:35,220 --> 02:53:37,780
When I was a murderer.

3645
02:53:38,760 --> 02:53:40,020
Here we are, here we are, here we are.

3646
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:42,600
Yeah, start grabbing these.

3647
02:53:43,460 --> 02:53:43,820
Sweet.

3648
02:53:45,280 --> 02:53:45,640
Delicious.

3649
02:53:46,060 --> 02:53:47,140
Oh, no, the gemmy.

3650
02:53:51,460 --> 02:53:51,820
Optimize.

3651
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:53,880
Here we go, here we go.

3652
02:53:53,920 --> 02:53:54,700
Here's a lot, here's a lot.

3653
02:53:57,760 --> 02:53:58,280
Here's some.

3654
02:53:58,540 --> 02:53:58,900
Nice.

3655
02:53:59,800 --> 02:54:00,720
There's a sweet gem.

3656
02:54:00,960 --> 02:54:01,640
Oh, you!

3657
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:05,100
Where did the gem go?

3658
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:07,800
Oh, you!

3659
02:54:08,640 --> 02:54:09,720
How much more do I...

3660
02:54:09,720 --> 02:54:11,360
Oh my gosh, I still have so much more time.

3661
02:54:11,940 --> 02:54:12,340
Guys.

3662
02:54:18,550 --> 02:54:19,350
Oh, nice.

3663
02:54:21,270 --> 02:54:21,670
I think

3664
02:54:29,950 --> 02:54:35,810
the grenade might be good to optimize.

3665
02:54:36,130 --> 02:54:37,510
Or have more of.

3666
02:54:39,330 --> 02:54:40,610
You, you, you.

3667
02:54:41,930 --> 02:54:42,510
You, you, you.

3668
02:54:42,510 --> 02:54:43,410
Oh, gosh, oh, gosh.

3669
02:54:43,850 --> 02:54:44,790
Oh, gosh, oh, gosh, oh, gosh.

3670
02:54:45,310 --> 02:54:45,970
Oh, gosh, oh, gosh.

3671
02:54:46,430 --> 02:54:47,090
Oh, gosh, oh, gosh.

3672
02:54:59,150 --> 02:55:00,290
Oh, don't put you in there.

3673
02:55:00,550 --> 02:55:02,110
That's like counterproductive though.

3674
02:55:03,310 --> 02:55:04,090
That's not what I want.

3675
02:55:04,470 --> 02:55:05,170
Don't go in there.

3676
02:55:06,110 --> 02:55:06,890
Don't go in there.

3677
02:55:08,110 --> 02:55:08,390
No!

3678
02:55:22,200 --> 02:55:22,720
You know what?

3679
02:55:22,780 --> 02:55:23,040
Let's...

3680
02:55:23,340 --> 02:55:24,800
We've been using the slash a lot.

3681
02:55:25,080 --> 02:55:25,360
So...

3682
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:27,640
I think it's fine.

3683
02:55:27,640 --> 02:55:28,020
It's good to have.

3684
02:55:30,900 --> 02:55:31,780
Come on, come on, come on.

3685
02:55:31,920 --> 02:55:32,200
Yeah!

3686
02:55:33,360 --> 02:55:33,720
No!

3687
02:55:35,940 --> 02:55:36,640
Down, down, down.

3688
02:55:37,160 --> 02:55:37,680
Aim down.

3689
02:55:38,980 --> 02:55:39,580
Oh my gosh.

3690
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:40,140
It's not enough.

3691
02:55:44,060 --> 02:55:44,640
There it is.

3692
02:55:45,240 --> 02:55:45,600
Yippee!

3693
02:55:47,260 --> 02:55:48,400
Give me the sweet bucks.

3694
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:50,540
Oh!

3695
02:55:50,860 --> 02:55:51,640
I got three!

3696
02:55:52,600 --> 02:55:53,260
Oh my gosh.

3697
02:55:53,460 --> 02:55:53,820
Yeah!

3698
02:55:55,780 --> 02:55:56,180
Let's go.

3699
02:55:57,640 --> 02:55:59,420
Just playing Autakai with some cute maid.

3700
02:55:59,460 --> 02:55:59,900
Don't kill me.

3701
02:56:02,620 --> 02:56:03,100
Nice.

3702
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:04,440
Nice.

3703
02:56:04,540 --> 02:56:04,780
Nice.

3704
02:56:04,780 --> 02:56:04,980
Nice.

3705
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:05,220
Good.

3706
02:56:05,340 --> 02:56:06,080
Just one minute left.

3707
02:56:06,980 --> 02:56:08,220
Just one minute left.

3708
02:56:09,920 --> 02:56:11,620
I think we're fine now, honestly.

3709
02:56:13,280 --> 02:56:16,620
I think we're more than good, to be honest.

3710
02:56:23,010 --> 02:56:24,750
Kinda cleared out a bunch of the...

3711
02:56:24,750 --> 02:56:25,510
Big horde.

3712
02:56:25,710 --> 02:56:26,150
So...

3713
02:56:26,830 --> 02:56:29,970
Sometimes like her shot is so good a damage.

3714
02:56:30,230 --> 02:56:31,170
I mean, there's like...

3715
02:56:31,170 --> 02:56:33,770
Maybe she can, like, crit stuff and... you know.

3716
02:56:38,240 --> 02:56:38,720
Oh!

3717
02:56:38,860 --> 02:56:39,340
Oopsie.

3718
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:42,080
Slash!

3719
02:56:43,420 --> 02:56:44,340
Get out of my way!

3720
02:56:45,400 --> 02:56:46,180
Minto Gaming!

3721
02:56:52,720 --> 02:56:56,000
I wish I could convert some of these maids to my side.

3722
02:56:56,320 --> 02:56:57,980
They would make such a great army!

3723
02:56:58,340 --> 02:56:59,640
The maid army!

3724
02:57:01,740 --> 02:57:02,700
Increase healing...

3725
02:57:08,680 --> 02:57:10,460
We only have 10 seconds.

3726
02:57:10,620 --> 02:57:10,840
We're good.

3727
02:57:12,840 --> 02:57:17,630
Blah, blah, blah, blah...

3728
02:57:21,450 --> 02:57:21,890
Yippie!

3729
02:57:22,070 --> 02:57:23,570
Set her crit rate as 15%.

3730
02:57:23,570 --> 02:57:24,530
Ah, okay, okay.

3731
02:57:26,050 --> 02:57:26,490
Yay!

3732
02:57:29,730 --> 02:57:32,730
What are the odds that the maid that looks like you uses a sniper rifle?

3733
02:57:32,890 --> 02:57:34,390
I don't know what to tell...

3734
02:57:34,390 --> 02:57:36,010
She doesn't look exactly like me.

3735
02:57:39,050 --> 02:57:39,930
You know...

3736
02:57:40,950 --> 02:57:42,070
We still S-ranked it.

3737
02:57:48,880 --> 02:57:50,360
How much money do we have?

3738
02:57:51,820 --> 02:57:52,940
The sprite does.

3739
02:57:53,720 --> 02:57:54,940
How much money do we have?

3740
02:57:55,920 --> 02:57:56,960
11,000!

3741
02:57:57,380 --> 02:57:58,240
Okay, we're close.

3742
02:58:00,600 --> 02:58:01,120
But...

3743
02:58:01,720 --> 02:58:02,480
Oh, but...

3744
02:58:03,080 --> 02:58:03,600
But...

3745
02:58:04,420 --> 02:58:06,340
But, she's like my big sister.

3746
02:58:06,940 --> 02:58:09,980
I do kind of like using the katana.

3747
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:14,720
So, I think I might actually... Okay.

3748
02:58:14,940 --> 02:58:16,280
I'll use the sniper rifle.

3749
02:58:16,760 --> 02:58:18,180
And the sniper rifle!

3750
02:58:19,220 --> 02:58:20,180
Is not...

3751
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:22,580
Super easy, but it's not bad.

3752
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,320
Is this map even remotely close to Akiba?

3753
02:58:26,720 --> 02:58:28,560
The CG scenes are...

3754
02:58:28,560 --> 02:58:29,120
Like...

3755
02:58:29,720 --> 02:58:30,200
Almost...

3756
02:58:30,200 --> 02:58:31,160
Super accurate.

3757
02:58:34,980 --> 02:58:37,780
Actually, I think the map is actually kind of accurate too.

3758
02:58:40,680 --> 02:58:41,360
You know what?

3759
02:58:41,380 --> 02:58:41,520
Yeah.

3760
02:58:41,560 --> 02:58:43,780
Let's just upgrade the sniper rifle.

3761
02:58:44,300 --> 02:58:45,580
I think we should be good there.

3762
02:58:48,240 --> 02:58:49,200
Like this map?

3763
02:58:49,480 --> 02:58:50,840
So, if this is...

3764
02:58:51,640 --> 02:58:53,720
If this is UDX...

3765
02:58:54,180 --> 02:58:56,280
Then, this would be the main street...

3766
02:58:57,220 --> 02:58:58,400
Of Akihabara, right?

3767
02:58:58,620 --> 02:59:00,000
Oh, I'm kind of blocking some of it.

3768
02:59:03,480 --> 02:59:05,460
This would be the main street, Chuo Dori.

3769
02:59:07,700 --> 02:59:09,460
This is actually, yeah, pretty accurate.

3770
02:59:09,920 --> 02:59:10,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3771
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:12,200
This is the train station.

3772
02:59:12,500 --> 02:59:13,960
Because UDX, you go here.

3773
02:59:14,060 --> 02:59:15,560
And train station would be right here.

3774
02:59:15,560 --> 02:59:15,700
Right here.

3775
02:59:19,280 --> 02:59:19,600
And...

3776
02:59:20,400 --> 02:59:21,040
Yeah.

3777
02:59:21,180 --> 02:59:23,600
This is basically the size of Akihabara even.

3778
02:59:23,800 --> 02:59:24,240
So...

3779
02:59:24,240 --> 02:59:26,380
It's pretty accurate.

3780
02:59:26,920 --> 02:59:27,680
Oh, bullets!

3781
02:59:27,980 --> 02:59:28,760
Thank you.

3782
02:59:28,860 --> 02:59:29,340
Oh my gosh.

3783
02:59:29,400 --> 02:59:30,220
You guys saved me.

3784
02:59:30,260 --> 02:59:30,700
Thank you.

3785
02:59:33,680 --> 02:59:35,020
You guys saved me.

3786
02:59:35,180 --> 02:59:36,100
Thank you.

3787
02:59:36,800 --> 02:59:37,440
Workshop.

3788
02:59:38,740 --> 02:59:39,720
Buy items.

3789
02:59:45,560 --> 02:59:46,100
Let's do five.

3790
02:59:53,490 --> 02:59:57,450
Mint enters her mind palace and can view Akihabara as a top-down.

3791
03:00:01,730 --> 03:00:04,370
Yeah, just call me Mint Lockholmes.

3792
03:00:10,160 --> 03:00:11,060
Defeat all enemies.

3793
03:00:11,640 --> 03:00:12,120
Easy.

3794
03:00:12,860 --> 03:00:13,380
Let's go.

3795
03:00:14,820 --> 03:00:15,940
This game is so much fun.

3796
03:00:16,220 --> 03:00:16,720
Oh my gosh.

3797
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:17,140
Yes.

3798
03:00:17,320 --> 03:00:17,760
Let's go.

3799
03:00:18,880 --> 03:00:21,700
It basically scratches every single one of my itches.

3800
03:00:22,180 --> 03:00:25,060
Like being like a visual novel and also...

3801
03:00:28,120 --> 03:00:32,800
Being a little edgy and cute and having maids and the vampire survivors part.

3802
03:00:32,980 --> 03:00:34,040
Like every bit of it.

3803
03:00:34,140 --> 03:00:34,820
I'm just like...

3804
03:00:34,820 --> 03:00:35,940
Yeah, I love this.

3805
03:00:36,260 --> 03:00:37,660
The sprites are really cute.

3806
03:00:37,840 --> 03:00:38,340
They are.

3807
03:00:38,500 --> 03:00:40,180
They kind of remind me of phantom breaker.

3808
03:00:41,980 --> 03:00:44,800
Does anyone else get that kind of vibe from them?

3809
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:45,720
Toilet paper!

3810
03:00:47,360 --> 03:00:48,560
I think that's the fiber.

3811
03:00:49,920 --> 03:00:53,200
Oh, there's like more obstacles and stuff now.

3812
03:00:53,280 --> 03:00:53,800
It's kind of fun.

3813
03:00:57,340 --> 03:00:57,820
Mint.

3814
03:00:57,880 --> 03:00:58,900
Mint tante.

3815
03:01:01,880 --> 03:01:02,920
Reminds me of Holocure.

3816
03:01:03,080 --> 03:01:03,440
Yes.

3817
03:01:03,480 --> 03:01:03,700
Yes.

3818
03:01:03,860 --> 03:01:07,180
Well, Holocure is also based off of vampire survivors, right?

3819
03:01:07,240 --> 03:01:08,760
So it's...

3820
03:01:10,820 --> 03:01:11,880
It's all the same.

3821
03:01:11,960 --> 03:01:12,840
A little bit.

3822
03:01:21,510 --> 03:01:21,990
Nice.

3823
03:01:22,810 --> 03:01:23,830
Let's add more...

3824
03:01:23,830 --> 03:01:24,930
I like these guys.

3825
03:01:25,050 --> 03:01:26,750
I don't know if they even do that much but...

3826
03:01:27,670 --> 03:01:28,590
They work for me.

3827
03:01:28,670 --> 03:01:30,690
I like having kind of a barrier.

3828
03:01:31,190 --> 03:01:31,770
They do enough.

3829
03:01:31,890 --> 03:01:32,550
They do a little bit.

3830
03:01:32,670 --> 03:01:33,650
I can see it working.

3831
03:01:35,890 --> 03:01:36,290
Optimize!

3832
03:01:39,550 --> 03:01:41,990
I didn't realize that my drones could run out.

3833
03:01:42,150 --> 03:01:42,970
That's so messed up.

3834
03:01:46,210 --> 03:01:47,370
That's so messed up.

3835
03:01:53,100 --> 03:01:53,900
More drones!

3836
03:02:07,550 --> 03:02:09,450
The electric drones seem good when they're active.

3837
03:02:09,530 --> 03:02:10,550
They're just not active very long.

3838
03:02:10,670 --> 03:02:12,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3839
03:02:13,130 --> 03:02:13,850
You're right.

3840
03:02:19,030 --> 03:02:22,950
It says that they have a cooldown but I didn't realize that they just disappeared altogether.

3841
03:02:23,850 --> 03:02:24,910
It's kind of messed up.

3842
03:02:26,130 --> 03:02:26,610
Sha!

3843
03:02:28,330 --> 03:02:28,810
Nice.

3844
03:02:32,850 --> 03:02:33,330
Optimize!

3845
03:02:34,130 --> 03:02:34,610
Oops.

3846
03:02:34,910 --> 03:02:35,210
Oops.

3847
03:02:36,030 --> 03:02:37,910
I didn't realize I was still on a cooldown.

3848
03:02:43,470 --> 03:02:46,050
Sometimes I forget to aim when I'm trying to like find...

3849
03:02:46,050 --> 03:02:46,970
Let's see.

3850
03:02:51,590 --> 03:02:53,270
Oh, the HP auto-healing.

3851
03:02:53,450 --> 03:02:54,550
Let's get that for sure.

3852
03:02:55,970 --> 03:02:57,170
Let's get that for sure.

3853
03:03:01,970 --> 03:03:03,430
Requires a charging period.

3854
03:03:05,650 --> 03:03:07,470
Did you do your pulls for Dressina?

3855
03:03:07,770 --> 03:03:09,290
Oh, I already did them, Scourge.

3856
03:03:09,290 --> 03:03:09,490
Yeah.

3857
03:03:11,190 --> 03:03:15,090
I have already done them and I got her after many a pull.

3858
03:03:16,830 --> 03:03:21,390
I got her after many a pull but I still got her nonetheless.

3859
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:27,440
Nice.

3860
03:03:30,700 --> 03:03:38,220
Yeah, since there's a lot of enemies and we're trying to defeat all of them, having the missiles and grenades and stuff is good, I think.

3861
03:03:39,420 --> 03:03:39,860
Yeah.

3862
03:03:42,980 --> 03:03:43,820
Rip Oimo.

3863
03:03:44,820 --> 03:03:45,740
Screw Oimo.

3864
03:03:48,380 --> 03:03:49,300
Screw Oimo.

3865
03:03:49,940 --> 03:03:52,680
Wait, what's that little arrow pointing to?

3866
03:03:56,880 --> 03:03:57,760
You see that?

3867
03:03:57,860 --> 03:03:58,200
You see that?

3868
03:04:07,180 --> 03:04:08,080
What are we heading to?

3869
03:04:08,160 --> 03:04:08,300
Oh!

3870
03:04:08,740 --> 03:04:10,540
You killed this special thing and I didn't even notice.

3871
03:04:10,840 --> 03:04:11,300
Oh my god.

3872
03:04:11,600 --> 03:04:13,000
Oh, I wasted that.

3873
03:04:13,120 --> 03:04:13,540
My bad.

3874
03:04:15,140 --> 03:04:15,760
There we go.

3875
03:04:17,400 --> 03:04:18,620
Yeah, screw Oimo.

3876
03:04:22,930 --> 03:04:23,450
Okay.

3877
03:04:24,490 --> 03:04:28,890
So it does alert you when you have dropped something.

3878
03:04:29,590 --> 03:04:31,150
Like that, which is nice.

3879
03:04:31,750 --> 03:04:34,030
I always appreciate when games do that.

3880
03:04:34,150 --> 03:04:35,390
Thank you, games.

3881
03:04:35,490 --> 03:04:36,250
Thank you, games.

3882
03:04:38,030 --> 03:04:39,310
Wish I could get a vacuum.

3883
03:04:39,570 --> 03:04:41,870
There's a lot of hearts, but they're all really spread out.

3884
03:04:47,530 --> 03:04:48,370
Drone strength.

3885
03:04:51,850 --> 03:04:53,290
Oh, here's another one.

3886
03:05:03,870 --> 03:05:06,230
You gave her so much gacha luck by cursing her again.

3887
03:05:07,290 --> 03:05:09,690
That girl doesn't need any gacha luck at all.

3888
03:05:09,890 --> 03:05:10,890
She's like...

3889
03:05:10,890 --> 03:05:13,610
Oh my gacha luck is so bad.

3890
03:05:14,010 --> 03:05:18,430
She had like 100,000 plus gemis.

3891
03:05:23,310 --> 03:05:25,010
What gacha luck do you need?

3892
03:05:25,090 --> 03:05:26,930
You're just a whale.

3893
03:05:27,190 --> 03:05:28,930
It doesn't matter about your luck.

3894
03:05:29,010 --> 03:05:29,770
You're going to get them anyway.

3895
03:05:39,140 --> 03:05:40,880
Leave us plebeians alone.

3896
03:05:41,360 --> 03:05:43,220
It's basically free to play.

3897
03:05:44,840 --> 03:05:46,780
Let the whales do their thing.

3898
03:05:47,980 --> 03:05:52,800
But don't take away the luck of us plebes.

3899
03:05:56,720 --> 03:06:00,000
Every time you clicked off the stream, she started laughing at your misfortune.

3900
03:06:00,100 --> 03:06:00,760
I believe that.

3901
03:06:03,060 --> 03:06:04,400
Mike Tyson's ass!

3902
03:06:04,860 --> 03:06:05,660
You're eating!

3903
03:06:07,120 --> 03:06:07,920
No, girl.

3904
03:06:08,060 --> 03:06:08,600
You ate.

3905
03:06:09,560 --> 03:06:10,840
Thanks for the five gifts.

3906
03:06:18,600 --> 03:06:19,720
The legend.

3907
03:06:20,600 --> 03:06:22,800
I really appreciate you always being around.

3908
03:06:22,800 --> 03:06:24,180
Thank you.

3909
03:06:26,380 --> 03:06:29,180
I'm honored to be visited by a legend.

3910
03:06:33,420 --> 03:06:36,940
I wonder how long this one is.

3911
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,020
It's to feed all the enemies but they seem very...

3912
03:06:39,020 --> 03:06:41,480
It doesn't seem like there are very many guys here.

3913
03:06:44,760 --> 03:06:46,900
Not very many people around anymore.

3914
03:06:53,200 --> 03:06:54,420
Zombies, are you all dead?

3915
03:06:54,960 --> 03:06:55,980
Are you all gone?

3916
03:06:56,940 --> 03:06:59,080
Were you all underneath this car?

3917
03:07:00,200 --> 03:07:01,520
Is this where you guys are?

3918
03:07:04,320 --> 03:07:04,760
Zombies...

3919
03:07:06,420 --> 03:07:07,160
Hey, hey.

3920
03:07:08,580 --> 03:07:09,280
Don't double.

3921
03:07:09,920 --> 03:07:11,000
Don't double team me.

3922
03:07:12,880 --> 03:07:13,320
Nice.

3923
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:19,900
Chris is shooting strength by 8%.

3924
03:07:20,700 --> 03:07:22,500
I wonder if this one will be good to have too.

3925
03:07:31,910 --> 03:07:32,350
Wait.

3926
03:07:32,690 --> 03:07:33,550
I mean...

3927
03:07:33,550 --> 03:07:34,170
Oh, no.

3928
03:07:34,270 --> 03:07:35,050
I'm taking damage.

3929
03:07:36,650 --> 03:07:37,510
Oh, no.

3930
03:07:37,810 --> 03:07:38,250
I'm...

3931
03:07:38,250 --> 03:07:39,730
I'm taking damage.

3932
03:07:39,970 --> 03:07:40,850
Oh, no.

3933
03:07:41,930 --> 03:07:43,930
In my ecchi maid game.

3934
03:07:44,050 --> 03:07:46,250
Whatever will I do if I take too much damage?

3935
03:07:50,070 --> 03:07:51,570
Don't gang up on me.

3936
03:07:51,750 --> 03:07:52,110
Oh, my God.

3937
03:07:52,150 --> 03:07:52,310
Wait.

3938
03:07:52,630 --> 03:07:53,370
Wait, guys.

3939
03:07:58,220 --> 03:07:58,760
Oh, no.

3940
03:07:58,820 --> 03:07:59,740
I'm gaming too hard.

3941
03:07:59,840 --> 03:08:00,380
I can't...

3942
03:08:00,380 --> 03:08:01,460
I can't lose clothes.

3943
03:08:02,840 --> 03:08:04,460
They need to make the game harder.

3944
03:08:05,400 --> 03:08:07,080
So that I can lose more clothes.

3945
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:21,840
Oh, no.

3946
03:08:21,980 --> 03:08:23,000
I'm just going to...

3947
03:08:23,780 --> 03:08:25,500
The curse of being a pro gamer.

3948
03:08:27,060 --> 03:08:28,460
Make the game more difficult.

3949
03:08:33,080 --> 03:08:34,820
I guess we'll do the shot support.

3950
03:08:35,060 --> 03:08:36,220
It says it affects other stuff too.

3951
03:08:36,860 --> 03:08:37,980
I wonder what it affects.

3952
03:08:39,180 --> 03:08:39,780
Oh, nice.

3953
03:08:42,500 --> 03:08:43,800
Minto when she plays Delta.

3954
03:08:45,980 --> 03:08:46,660
Only 30.

3955
03:08:50,440 --> 03:08:51,000
Oh, wait.

3956
03:08:51,020 --> 03:08:51,500
There's another one.

3957
03:08:54,560 --> 03:08:55,080
Come on.

3958
03:08:55,500 --> 03:08:55,860
Nice.

3959
03:08:56,920 --> 03:08:57,840
Give me more money.

3960
03:08:59,320 --> 03:09:00,820
Senran Kagura levels of logic.

3961
03:09:01,640 --> 03:09:03,400
Oh, we got a lot of money there, you guys.

3962
03:09:04,140 --> 03:09:05,620
I'm just going to start running into them.

3963
03:09:05,800 --> 03:09:06,120
All right.

3964
03:09:07,360 --> 03:09:08,160
Come on.

3965
03:09:08,220 --> 03:09:09,280
Take off my clothes.

3966
03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:18,720
Take my clothes.

3967
03:09:21,740 --> 03:09:22,300
Okay.

3968
03:09:35,750 --> 03:09:38,150
Look how much my health has increased.

3969
03:09:38,330 --> 03:09:38,750
It's fine.

3970
03:09:40,670 --> 03:09:41,230
How

3971
03:09:51,910 --> 03:09:53,630
many more guys are there?

3972
03:10:00,760 --> 03:10:01,720
I'm too OP.

3973
03:10:02,080 --> 03:10:03,560
I'm too OP, you guys.

3974
03:10:05,400 --> 03:10:07,160
I'm actually too OP, I think.

3975
03:10:11,320 --> 03:10:12,520
Regen is pretty busted.

3976
03:10:12,740 --> 03:10:13,700
Yeah, 100%.

3977
03:10:13,700 --> 03:10:15,040
It really is.

3978
03:10:15,680 --> 03:10:16,460
Oh, a vacuum.

3979
03:10:17,760 --> 03:10:18,600
Oh, sorry.

3980
03:10:19,220 --> 03:10:20,080
Don't hurt me.

3981
03:10:46,310 --> 03:10:48,190
Regains my special skill power.

3982
03:10:48,390 --> 03:10:48,630
You know what?

3983
03:10:48,650 --> 03:10:49,110
Let's just use it.

3984
03:10:56,480 --> 03:10:58,020
Everything's going to be max at this point.

3985
03:10:58,200 --> 03:10:58,880
I'm going to have to...

3986
03:10:58,880 --> 03:11:00,320
I have room for other skills.

3987
03:11:00,960 --> 03:11:01,620
I don't know.

3988
03:11:01,620 --> 03:11:03,600
I haven't decided what I want to get hit yet.

3989
03:11:03,880 --> 03:11:05,880
Which is why I'm just maxing everything else out.

3990
03:11:06,940 --> 03:11:09,900
This one was like destroy all the enemies, wasn't it?

3991
03:11:10,460 --> 03:11:11,420
When does it end?

3992
03:11:18,390 --> 03:11:19,510
This level is long.

3993
03:11:19,770 --> 03:11:20,630
Yeah, for real.

3994
03:11:22,870 --> 03:11:24,090
There's so many enemies.

3995
03:11:26,270 --> 03:11:27,230
Oh, nice.

3996
03:11:28,710 --> 03:11:29,190
Oh.

3997
03:11:30,890 --> 03:11:31,990
They all disappeared.

3998
03:11:31,990 --> 03:11:32,850
We did it!

3999
03:11:36,050 --> 03:11:38,610
It was 2,197 specifically.

4000
03:11:41,870 --> 03:11:45,450
Who knew being a maid was such hard work in serving and fighting?

4001
03:11:45,650 --> 03:11:46,210
I know, right?

4002
03:11:46,850 --> 03:11:48,170
It's never easy for us.

4003
03:11:52,830 --> 03:11:55,410
I lost my clothes, but I'm still S rank, baby.

4004
03:11:57,550 --> 03:11:58,630
Let's go to the next one.

4005
03:12:00,010 --> 03:12:01,190
I really just want to...

4006
03:12:01,190 --> 03:12:02,870
I really just want to find the new girl.

4007
03:12:04,270 --> 03:12:05,310
Oh, defeat the boss!

4008
03:12:05,470 --> 03:12:05,810
Here we go!

4009
03:12:07,010 --> 03:12:07,890
You guys...

4010
03:12:08,550 --> 03:12:09,610
Here we go!

4011
03:12:10,110 --> 03:12:10,430
Wait.

4012
03:12:11,610 --> 03:12:12,750
Before I do that, actually.

4013
03:12:13,270 --> 03:12:14,050
I didn't even...

4014
03:12:14,050 --> 03:12:15,670
I didn't even recruit any new girls.

4015
03:12:18,790 --> 03:12:20,510
Keep from being drama-free.

4016
03:12:20,710 --> 03:12:21,670
Tough month, huh?

4017
03:12:21,770 --> 03:12:22,610
Wait, what do you mean?

4018
03:12:24,230 --> 03:12:25,210
What did I say?

4019
03:12:35,680 --> 03:12:36,640
What did I do?

4020
03:12:38,560 --> 03:12:39,080
Upgrades?

4021
03:12:39,420 --> 03:12:41,080
But I'm saving up for the hairpin.

4022
03:12:41,180 --> 03:12:41,440
You know what?

4023
03:12:41,500 --> 03:12:43,200
Who cares about the hairpin?

4024
03:12:45,560 --> 03:12:47,540
I'm all about that drama, baby.

4025
03:12:51,320 --> 03:12:52,120
Level 6.

4026
03:12:53,340 --> 03:12:54,160
Level 5.

4027
03:12:58,160 --> 03:12:59,040
Level 6.

4028
03:12:59,360 --> 03:13:00,140
That should be good.

4029
03:13:00,340 --> 03:13:01,260
That should be enough.

4030
03:13:02,260 --> 03:13:02,980
Let's strike.

4031
03:13:03,820 --> 03:13:06,640
Will you play this game entirely or just kind of off-stream?

4032
03:13:07,420 --> 03:13:08,480
I don't know yet.

4033
03:13:11,660 --> 03:13:12,500
I don't know yet.

4034
03:13:12,720 --> 03:13:13,940
I think I'll probably play...

4035
03:13:13,940 --> 03:13:14,580
You know...

4036
03:13:14,580 --> 03:13:16,260
I can probably stream it while I'm in Japan.

4037
03:13:16,400 --> 03:13:17,580
This is a perfect game to stream.

4038
03:13:17,720 --> 03:13:20,120
I'm trying to find, like, games I can play also in Japan.

4039
03:13:21,600 --> 03:13:23,120
Ones that aren't too difficult...

4040
03:13:24,340 --> 03:13:26,080
for me to, like...

4041
03:13:27,020 --> 03:13:28,840
Because, you know, playing on a laptop...

4042
03:13:29,760 --> 03:13:32,100
Playing on a laptop is not always easy.

4043
03:13:35,840 --> 03:13:36,280
I really don't know how to play on a laptop.

4044
03:13:37,360 --> 03:13:38,020
Hologyre Arc?

4045
03:13:38,160 --> 03:13:38,340
I...

4046
03:13:38,940 --> 03:13:39,380
Maybe.

4047
03:13:39,860 --> 03:13:41,000
I'll probably play that too.

4048
03:13:42,380 --> 03:13:44,400
Probably play that while I'm in Japan too.

4049
03:13:49,780 --> 03:13:51,060
Everything's a bit cleaner now, huh?

4050
03:13:51,180 --> 03:13:52,900
I never expected there to be so many zombies.

4051
03:13:55,380 --> 03:13:56,240
Poring, poring.

4052
03:14:00,280 --> 03:14:02,700
It's to be expected when you shoot off such flashy fireworks.

4053
03:14:05,120 --> 03:14:06,660
I don't think that's all there is to it.

4054
03:14:37,300 --> 03:14:38,880
It's very back-saving.

4055
03:14:39,080 --> 03:14:39,460
Yeah!

4056
03:14:44,060 --> 03:14:44,440
So...

4057
03:14:44,980 --> 03:14:46,480
You know, they're just like...

4058
03:14:46,480 --> 03:14:47,120
This is the meta.

4059
03:14:47,220 --> 03:14:48,540
Why are you playing like this?

4060
03:14:48,640 --> 03:14:49,340
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

4061
03:14:49,880 --> 03:14:50,860
So, I don't know.

4062
03:14:50,900 --> 03:14:52,440
I'll have to be...

4063
03:14:52,440 --> 03:14:53,960
One of those...

4064
03:14:54,420 --> 03:14:57,500
In a mood where I'm prepared for people to back-save me.

4065
03:14:57,520 --> 03:14:58,020
You know what I mean?

4066
03:15:00,940 --> 03:15:01,700
Because usually...

4067
03:15:01,700 --> 03:15:04,580
Some days I'm okay with it, and some days I'll be like...

4068
03:15:04,580 --> 03:15:06,560
Oh my gosh, I cannot handle it right now.

4069
03:15:08,440 --> 03:15:08,880
So...

4070
03:15:10,640 --> 03:15:11,380
Yeah, yeah.

4071
03:15:12,500 --> 03:15:14,420
But I have been wanting to play it.

4072
03:15:14,480 --> 03:15:15,840
I've been like, oh my gosh, I want to do...

4073
03:15:16,640 --> 03:15:17,080
Holocure.

4074
03:15:17,240 --> 03:15:18,860
I played the one Corona game.

4075
03:15:19,020 --> 03:15:19,660
It was so much fun.

4076
03:15:20,740 --> 03:15:23,220
And I played it actually off-stream as well too.

4077
03:15:24,080 --> 03:15:25,360
I kept playing it.

4078
03:15:26,700 --> 03:15:27,140
But...

4079
03:15:28,160 --> 03:15:29,400
Overly eager passengers.

4080
03:15:29,640 --> 03:15:30,060
Yes!

4081
03:15:30,700 --> 03:15:32,620
You must fish in Holocure only.

4082
03:15:32,780 --> 03:15:34,620
Fish fishing is the only game.

4083
03:15:39,860 --> 03:15:40,340
But...

4084
03:15:40,340 --> 03:15:40,560
But...

4085
03:15:40,560 --> 03:15:41,260
Corona box?

4086
03:15:41,520 --> 03:15:41,700
Yeah!

4087
03:15:42,040 --> 03:15:43,840
That one's really fun to play.

4088
03:15:46,540 --> 03:15:48,200
We have our own style of play.

4089
03:15:48,300 --> 03:15:48,880
And that is okay.

4090
03:15:49,460 --> 03:15:52,500
See, that's like a really reasonable way to think about things.

4091
03:15:53,240 --> 03:15:53,720
But...

4092
03:15:53,720 --> 03:15:56,600
There are also people that just get very passionate.

4093
03:15:57,300 --> 03:15:58,220
And I understand.

4094
03:15:58,660 --> 03:16:00,080
They're just like, I'm excited.

4095
03:16:00,200 --> 03:16:02,520
But, you know, for those kinds of passionate people...

4096
03:16:02,520 --> 03:16:04,040
Just play the game yourself.

4097
03:16:04,040 --> 03:16:05,820
If you're just like...

4098
03:16:05,820 --> 03:16:07,980
I don't like the way these VTubers play in the game.

4099
03:16:08,100 --> 03:16:09,360
Then go do it yourself.

4100
03:16:11,200 --> 03:16:13,440
Just go play it yourself.

4101
03:16:15,960 --> 03:16:16,940
Anyway, okay.

4102
03:16:19,020 --> 03:16:20,520
That might not be the only reason.

4103
03:16:20,560 --> 03:16:21,260
There were a ton of them though.

4104
03:16:21,800 --> 03:16:22,280
Two!

4105
03:16:26,620 --> 03:16:28,000
Obyn from Bloons.

4106
03:16:28,080 --> 03:16:29,220
Holocure backseaters.

4107
03:16:29,340 --> 03:16:29,960
Handle it.

4108
03:16:31,340 --> 03:16:32,040
So true.

4109
03:16:34,420 --> 03:16:36,620
Have you figured something out?

4110
03:16:36,680 --> 03:16:37,000
Miss Rinka?

4111
03:16:42,260 --> 03:16:44,440
Oh, it's kind of obvious from the location.

4112
03:16:44,560 --> 03:16:45,860
But I guess you'll see once we go inside.

4113
03:16:48,700 --> 03:16:50,440
Definitely a VTuber moment.

4114
03:16:54,380 --> 03:16:54,900
Stop!

4115
03:16:55,160 --> 03:16:56,080
This is the AKB Theater!

4116
03:16:59,480 --> 03:17:01,620
This is the AKB Theater!

4117
03:17:01,760 --> 03:17:02,200
No way!

4118
03:17:04,040 --> 03:17:04,140
Oh my gosh!

4119
03:17:04,500 --> 03:17:05,340
That's so funny!

4120
03:17:05,720 --> 03:17:07,600
Have you thought about playing the AquaVN?

4121
03:17:08,260 --> 03:17:09,080
Oh, oh!

4122
03:17:10,420 --> 03:17:10,940
Personally...

4123
03:17:10,940 --> 03:17:13,140
On my personal time, yes.

4124
03:17:14,820 --> 03:17:15,780
But on stream?

4125
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:16,500
I don't know.

4126
03:17:16,640 --> 03:17:17,140
I don't know.

4127
03:17:17,160 --> 03:17:17,380
Maybe.

4128
03:17:18,320 --> 03:17:18,940
What's that?

4129
03:17:19,340 --> 03:17:21,040
There's a group called AKB48.

4130
03:17:21,440 --> 03:17:22,680
And they had their beginnings.

4131
03:17:22,900 --> 03:17:23,840
Their humble beginnings.

4132
03:17:24,020 --> 03:17:25,180
In the theater.

4133
03:17:25,440 --> 03:17:27,700
In the Don Quixote of Akihabara.

4134
03:17:28,460 --> 03:17:30,560
And this is specifically that theater.

4135
03:17:30,840 --> 03:17:31,360
Because...

4136
03:17:31,360 --> 03:17:34,340
Each year, they put a different stripe of tape.

4137
03:17:34,700 --> 03:17:35,620
On the...

4138
03:17:36,640 --> 03:17:37,440
On the...

4139
03:17:37,440 --> 03:17:38,100
On the pillars.

4140
03:17:38,400 --> 03:17:40,280
So, that's how you can tell.

4141
03:17:45,520 --> 03:17:46,800
You didn't do anything wrong?

4142
03:17:47,020 --> 03:17:47,140
Oh.

4143
03:17:47,460 --> 03:17:50,220
Just election stuff and beast stuff.

4144
03:17:50,500 --> 03:17:51,020
What?

4145
03:17:51,860 --> 03:17:54,000
We can all come here and be drama free.

4146
03:17:54,280 --> 03:17:54,780
Oh!

4147
03:17:55,580 --> 03:17:56,100
Yeah.

4148
03:17:56,180 --> 03:17:58,720
We don't talk about anything at all.

4149
03:17:59,980 --> 03:18:00,780
We all...

4150
03:18:01,320 --> 03:18:02,140
I like to...

4151
03:18:02,140 --> 03:18:03,620
I like to just hang out and chill.

4152
03:18:05,360 --> 03:18:05,760
Yeah.

4153
03:18:09,760 --> 03:18:10,860
I don't know what's going on.

4154
03:18:11,140 --> 03:18:12,720
I only know heavy rotation song.

4155
03:18:12,900 --> 03:18:13,360
That's okay.

4156
03:18:13,500 --> 03:18:14,440
I like that song too.

4157
03:18:15,960 --> 03:18:17,640
I've been to Donkey there many times.

4158
03:18:17,660 --> 03:18:18,120
They had a theater.

4159
03:18:18,320 --> 03:18:18,600
Yeah!

4160
03:18:18,680 --> 03:18:19,840
You have to have a...

4161
03:18:19,840 --> 03:18:21,460
You have to apply online for a ticket.

4162
03:18:22,480 --> 03:18:24,340
You didn't have to do that in the past.

4163
03:18:24,400 --> 03:18:24,860
But now...

4164
03:18:24,860 --> 03:18:26,640
I mean, way, way in the past.

4165
03:18:26,820 --> 03:18:27,160
But...

4166
03:18:27,880 --> 03:18:29,520
It's hard to get tickets for it.

4167
03:18:30,480 --> 03:18:30,960
But...

4168
03:18:31,900 --> 03:18:32,520
But yeah!

4169
03:18:32,740 --> 03:18:34,580
They have a show almost every day.

4170
03:18:36,920 --> 03:18:37,940
Made for president!

4171
03:18:39,900 --> 03:18:41,020
Made for president!

4172
03:18:41,600 --> 03:18:42,460
I was...

4173
03:18:43,180 --> 03:18:43,660
Made...

4174
03:18:43,660 --> 03:18:44,800
To be number one.

4175
03:18:48,680 --> 03:18:51,260
From the footage I have, it appears to be a normal shopping mall.

4176
03:18:51,380 --> 03:18:52,120
Am I missing something?

4177
03:18:52,120 --> 03:18:53,600
Oh, I see.

4178
03:18:54,420 --> 03:18:55,680
I didn't know you, Kanon.

4179
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:57,520
Oh, right.

4180
03:18:57,740 --> 03:18:58,880
Of course you don't know Kanon.

4181
03:18:59,920 --> 03:19:02,740
This is the battle ground of underground idols.

4182
03:19:03,340 --> 03:19:04,300
We are doing a live performance.

4183
03:19:07,860 --> 03:19:10,340
This is the holy ground for underground idols.

4184
03:19:10,480 --> 03:19:11,060
Underground idols.

4185
03:19:11,480 --> 03:19:13,600
There are live performances here every day.

4186
03:19:13,940 --> 03:19:18,420
If there was a live performance when the pandemic broke out, it would have been a pretty tragic situation.

4187
03:19:19,140 --> 03:19:19,760
It would have been a pretty tragic situation.

4188
03:19:20,440 --> 03:19:24,800
If an outbreak were to occur during one of the performances, it would be disastrous, huh?

4189
03:19:24,940 --> 03:19:25,280
What?

4190
03:19:25,320 --> 03:19:25,780
It's pretty disastrous.

4191
03:19:28,980 --> 03:19:31,360
Even if they say underground idols, this place is massive enough to do live performances here.

4192
03:19:31,380 --> 03:19:32,600
It would have been pretty dangerous to even know about any group.

4193
03:19:33,760 --> 03:19:35,320
It would have been pretty dangerous to even know about any group.

4194
03:19:36,440 --> 03:19:39,780
Even though we say underground idols, this place is pretty famous.

4195
03:19:39,900 --> 03:19:42,340
Anyone who performed here would have had quite the fan base.

4196
03:19:43,020 --> 03:19:55,040
Aren't they gonna show the infamous column that impedes the view of like 30% of the seats?

4197
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:56,320
Hahahahaha.

4198
03:19:58,040 --> 03:19:58,780
Oh, gosh.

4199
03:20:00,260 --> 03:20:03,520
Then when you add in the staff, that's quite a lot of people, don't you think?

4200
03:20:03,920 --> 03:20:05,640
Stop spoiling the story.

4201
03:20:05,760 --> 03:20:06,000
Sorry!

4202
03:20:08,720 --> 03:20:09,420
No doubt.

4203
03:20:09,520 --> 03:20:12,060
It's actually funny too, because you can't bring UO's.

4204
03:20:13,080 --> 03:20:18,360
UO's are like pen lights that... or not pen lights, but they're like glow sticks that when you break them, they turn super duper bright.

4205
03:20:18,600 --> 03:20:26,320
But people in the theater, they've broken them so many times that they had to ban them.

4206
03:20:27,840 --> 03:20:31,040
Not because they're so bright, just because they keep breaking them.

4207
03:20:36,420 --> 03:20:37,120
Nagisa, look.

4208
03:20:40,040 --> 03:20:47,560
Sometimes it is painful to watch a streamer becoming frustrated because she's actively making the game harder on herself without even realizing it, so I can sympathize with helping to an extent.

4209
03:20:48,220 --> 03:20:50,700
I get that mentality, for sure.

4210
03:20:51,080 --> 03:20:59,360
I think also though, people are so... certain people can be very quick to jump and not allow someone to learn.

4211
03:20:59,960 --> 03:21:00,560
You know?

4212
03:21:00,660 --> 03:21:03,240
So it's just like... it's kind of a balance.

4213
03:21:03,500 --> 03:21:09,060
I think that's why a lot of streamers will have, like... they'll be like, okay I'm ready for back seating now.

4214
03:21:09,380 --> 03:21:19,320
They'll kind of... because everybody, you know, especially if someone's... especially if someone is playing a game for the first time, they will not know how to play it.

4215
03:21:19,460 --> 03:21:29,860
And so you have to give them a chance to learn how to learn the controls and, you know, it's... I think it's way more rewarding for someone to be playing a game and then, you know, be back in the game.

4216
03:21:43,380 --> 03:21:45,280
It's okay to have a hard time.

4217
03:21:45,380 --> 03:21:47,120
Yeah, everybody struggles sometimes.

4218
03:21:47,660 --> 03:21:49,100
We're all on the struggle bus.

4219
03:21:50,320 --> 03:21:51,360
Especially me.

4220
03:21:54,220 --> 03:21:55,820
Then chat spams, no help.

4221
03:21:57,360 --> 03:21:58,760
They're like, I need help now.

4222
03:21:58,900 --> 03:21:59,740
No help.

4223
03:22:04,300 --> 03:22:06,340
And sometimes, it's just skill issue.

4224
03:22:11,820 --> 03:22:14,280
Why would there be fireworks in this place?

4225
03:22:17,660 --> 03:22:18,860
Kanon, this confirms it.

4226
03:22:18,900 --> 03:22:20,700
There are a bunch of fireworks missing from the shelves.

4227
03:22:20,860 --> 03:22:22,300
The survivors must have used them.

4228
03:22:25,960 --> 03:22:26,880
Oh my god, my cat.

4229
03:22:27,040 --> 03:22:28,800
I thought I... I didn't see you there, pause!

4230
03:22:28,800 --> 03:22:30,900
Oh my gosh, I felt you, but I didn't see you.

4231
03:22:31,740 --> 03:22:32,540
Oh my god.

4232
03:22:32,640 --> 03:22:33,820
You little plopping girl.

4233
03:22:34,080 --> 03:22:34,980
You're so crazy.

4234
03:22:36,120 --> 03:22:37,360
She's rolling on the ground.

4235
03:22:37,740 --> 03:22:38,960
Let me let my cat out.

4236
03:22:39,220 --> 03:22:40,620
She's always hanging out with me.

4237
03:22:41,120 --> 03:22:42,060
I love her.

4238
03:22:42,960 --> 03:22:44,300
I love you little girl.

4239
03:22:44,400 --> 03:22:45,220
You're so stinky.

4240
03:22:45,380 --> 03:22:45,920
So cute.

4241
03:22:46,560 --> 03:22:47,660
What are you doing?

4242
03:22:48,240 --> 03:22:49,280
You're stretching.

4243
03:22:50,600 --> 03:22:52,060
You're being cute, girl.

4244
03:22:53,780 --> 03:22:54,820
You're so crazy.

4245
03:22:55,880 --> 03:22:57,020
You're a crazy girl.

4246
03:22:57,380 --> 03:22:57,820
You know that?

4247
03:22:57,920 --> 03:22:58,300
You're crazy.

4248
03:22:58,900 --> 03:22:59,480
You're crazy.

4249
03:22:59,780 --> 03:23:00,560
Okay, I'll be right back.

4250
03:23:01,580 --> 03:23:02,740
One month without pies.

4251
03:23:02,860 --> 03:23:03,440
Don't remind me.

4252
03:23:03,480 --> 03:23:03,940
Okay, please.

4253
03:23:04,360 --> 03:23:04,980
I'll be right back.

4254
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:05,580
Let me let her out.

4255
03:23:32,280 --> 03:23:34,000
It's funny because when I stream with Po...

4256
03:23:37,180 --> 03:23:37,500
Butaro.

4257
03:23:39,960 --> 03:23:41,500
When I stream with Butaro, he...

4258
03:23:46,660 --> 03:23:46,980
He...

4259
03:23:48,500 --> 03:23:48,820
He...

4260
03:23:49,920 --> 03:23:50,240
He...

4261
03:23:50,840 --> 03:23:51,160
He...

4262
03:23:53,260 --> 03:23:53,920
He...

4263
03:23:57,890 --> 03:24:02,040
He hates... As soon as I start streaming, he wants out of my room.

4264
03:24:02,720 --> 03:24:05,280
But with Paz, she likes to hang around.

4265
03:24:06,180 --> 03:24:06,840
Sorry.

4266
03:24:07,100 --> 03:24:12,920
I obviously combined Paz and Butaro together.

4267
03:24:13,980 --> 03:24:14,780
You know?

4268
03:24:19,860 --> 03:24:21,100
He's stream shy.

4269
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:22,580
Yeah.

4270
03:24:24,600 --> 03:24:27,120
I have two cats, if nobody knows.

4271
03:24:27,400 --> 03:24:28,220
If you don't know.

4272
03:24:28,340 --> 03:24:29,520
I have Paz.

4273
03:24:30,080 --> 03:24:31,640
I just got her recently.

4274
03:24:31,820 --> 03:24:33,200
And then I have Butaro.

4275
03:24:34,040 --> 03:24:35,180
He's my little guy.

4276
03:24:37,020 --> 03:24:39,180
I, too, combine my cats all the time.

4277
03:24:39,280 --> 03:24:39,500
Yeah.

4278
03:24:39,900 --> 03:24:40,380
Butaro.

4279
03:24:41,460 --> 03:24:42,960
Basically, might as well be him.

4280
03:24:46,680 --> 03:24:48,060
Any signs of the survivors?

4281
03:24:50,120 --> 03:24:52,100
Both are allegedly quite stinky.

4282
03:24:55,620 --> 03:24:57,060
Watch out, Nagisa!

4283
03:25:03,500 --> 03:25:04,300
Cute.

4284
03:25:16,480 --> 03:25:19,260
Isn't that Maidle 5's Arisa?

4285
03:25:19,780 --> 03:25:20,920
Maidle 5?

4286
03:25:21,400 --> 03:25:22,480
Maidle 5?

4287
03:25:22,820 --> 03:25:23,560
Maidle 5?

4288
03:25:33,900 --> 03:25:34,600
Super cute!

4289
03:25:36,040 --> 03:25:36,940
Remember what I said?

4290
03:25:37,120 --> 03:25:39,220
They're one of those popular underground idol groups.

4291
03:25:39,300 --> 03:25:41,780
Everyone's dressed in maid dresses and it's super cute!

4292
03:25:42,480 --> 03:25:55,560
Arisa-chan was the most popular out of the group, but to think she'd end up zombified like this...

4293
03:25:55,560 --> 03:25:58,400
Maybe she was a survivor.

4294
03:25:59,580 --> 03:26:00,960
I love my Chika idols.

4295
03:26:01,360 --> 03:26:03,400
I love my Chika idols zombified.

4296
03:26:04,320 --> 03:26:06,220
I love my Chika idols zombified.

4297
03:26:06,220 --> 03:26:08,520
Maybe we didn't make it on time.

4298
03:26:09,040 --> 03:26:09,860
No, wait.

4299
03:26:10,960 --> 03:26:15,180
She's a subject, but doesn't seem like she's completely zombified yet.

4300
03:26:15,700 --> 03:26:16,760
No, hold on a sec.

4301
03:26:16,940 --> 03:26:18,780
It looks like she hasn't fully transformed yet.

4302
03:26:19,180 --> 03:26:21,980
So... wanted I was the same as her?

4303
03:26:22,280 --> 03:26:23,660
So she's the same as us!

4304
03:26:23,900 --> 03:26:24,580
Oh my god.

4305
03:26:24,720 --> 03:26:27,280
The maid... the maid buff.

4306
03:26:28,660 --> 03:26:29,440
Maid buff!

4307
03:26:29,540 --> 03:26:30,000
Maid buff!

4308
03:26:30,320 --> 03:26:32,980
It appears so.

4309
03:26:33,180 --> 03:26:34,860
It may be that she's also...

4310
03:26:34,860 --> 03:26:39,020
Oh, she's always carried... Oh, it may be that she's always carried the antibodies.

4311
03:26:39,320 --> 03:26:41,500
There's also a chance that she might have developed them.

4312
03:26:43,200 --> 03:26:44,040
Who's better?

4313
03:26:44,300 --> 03:26:45,400
Sesshomaru or Sephiroth?

4314
03:26:46,040 --> 03:26:47,060
What the hell?

4315
03:26:52,280 --> 03:26:55,420
I'm not really a fan of either of them.

4316
03:26:56,920 --> 03:26:58,040
That doesn't matter now.

4317
03:26:58,280 --> 03:27:00,540
We still have a chance to save her, so we should hurry it up.

4318
03:27:00,540 --> 03:27:01,100
That's right.

4319
03:27:01,540 --> 03:27:03,220
Let's go, Rinko-chan!

4320
03:27:33,830 --> 03:27:34,470
An obstacle.

4321
03:27:34,710 --> 03:27:35,130
Got it.

4322
03:27:35,690 --> 03:27:36,330
Understood.

4323
03:27:37,170 --> 03:27:37,810
What?

4324
03:27:37,850 --> 03:27:38,830
Stop throwing it that way.

4325
03:27:40,110 --> 03:27:40,750
Nice.

4326
03:27:49,570 --> 03:27:51,250
Let's do a slash.

4327
03:27:58,390 --> 03:27:59,030
Nice.

4328
03:28:06,900 --> 03:28:09,720
This game has such awesome music.

4329
03:28:10,380 --> 03:28:11,640
Why is it so funny?

4330
03:28:14,900 --> 03:28:16,800
I want to get closer to the stage.

4331
03:28:17,480 --> 03:28:19,060
I'm gonna go cheer on Mayoshi!

4332
03:28:20,740 --> 03:28:22,760
I like the miniature missiles too.

4333
03:28:22,980 --> 03:28:24,200
I think they're pretty good.

4334
03:28:30,680 --> 03:28:31,440
Toilet paper!

4335
03:28:34,860 --> 03:28:38,300
I haven't needed things like the shields yet, so...

4336
03:28:38,300 --> 03:28:39,740
Oh, hello Otaku-chan!

4337
03:28:45,440 --> 03:28:47,220
I see a maid there, but...

4338
03:28:48,560 --> 03:28:49,820
It's like a maze in here.

4339
03:28:51,180 --> 03:28:54,600
Being able to get over to the...

4340
03:28:54,600 --> 03:28:54,860
Nice.

4341
03:28:55,140 --> 03:28:57,620
Oh, the stage!

4342
03:28:57,800 --> 03:28:59,140
Oh, you don't want to get trapped in here.

4343
03:28:59,200 --> 03:28:59,620
It's pretty bad.

4344
03:29:00,700 --> 03:29:01,880
You don't want to get trapped in here.

4345
03:29:01,940 --> 03:29:02,300
It's pretty bad.

4346
03:29:04,740 --> 03:29:06,320
Time to update my wish list.

4347
03:29:07,340 --> 03:29:08,460
It is fine though, right?

4348
03:29:08,640 --> 03:29:13,000
Most of the grenades she can throw across the barriers and stuff.

4349
03:29:13,020 --> 03:29:13,100
I don't know.

4350
03:29:13,100 --> 03:29:13,560
I hope it's so good.

4351
03:29:14,460 --> 03:29:15,060
Toilet paper!

4352
03:29:19,770 --> 03:29:20,370
Oh my god.

4353
03:29:20,630 --> 03:29:21,970
They're all funneling through here.

4354
03:29:22,790 --> 03:29:23,190
Nice!

4355
03:29:33,880 --> 03:29:35,260
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

4356
03:29:36,140 --> 03:29:37,100
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

4357
03:29:40,040 --> 03:29:40,440
Wow!

4358
03:29:42,140 --> 03:29:43,340
Get out of my face.

4359
03:29:44,520 --> 03:29:44,920
Nice!

4360
03:29:49,340 --> 03:29:49,780
Ah!

4361
03:29:49,780 --> 03:29:51,100
This is such a small map.

4362
03:29:51,300 --> 03:29:51,920
I know, right?

4363
03:29:52,640 --> 03:29:54,360
Yeah, I can see it becoming bad too.

4364
03:29:55,320 --> 03:29:55,760
Oh!

4365
03:29:55,960 --> 03:29:57,060
Oh, this is invisibility!

4366
03:29:57,700 --> 03:29:58,720
This is the invisibility...

4367
03:29:58,720 --> 03:29:59,320
Oh, well...

4368
03:29:59,320 --> 03:30:02,640
It doesn't last very long and they can still see me, I think!

4369
03:30:08,420 --> 03:30:08,860
Nice!

4370
03:30:10,180 --> 03:30:10,620
Nice!

4371
03:30:10,620 --> 03:30:10,740
Nice!

4372
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:24,680
Where's the boss?

4373
03:30:25,920 --> 03:30:26,500
Where's she at?

4374
03:30:27,220 --> 03:30:29,880
I think we have to go through it a little bit and then we get to her, right?

4375
03:30:37,060 --> 03:30:38,640
Oh, I'm getting trapped again.

4376
03:30:40,960 --> 03:30:41,640
Nice, nice.

4377
03:30:46,600 --> 03:30:47,160
Die, zombie!

4378
03:30:47,940 --> 03:30:48,340
Nice.

4379
03:30:56,320 --> 03:30:57,340
Give me money!

4380
03:30:58,660 --> 03:31:01,540
I don't know why do I need money in the apocalypse.

4381
03:31:03,420 --> 03:31:04,960
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

4382
03:31:05,020 --> 03:31:06,100
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

4383
03:31:07,220 --> 03:31:08,380
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

4384
03:31:09,060 --> 03:31:09,980
Oh, the pillars!

4385
03:31:16,580 --> 03:31:18,380
Let's do the incendiary grenade.

4386
03:31:19,160 --> 03:31:20,480
A nice passive one.

4387
03:31:22,400 --> 03:31:22,800
Oops.

4388
03:31:22,960 --> 03:31:24,280
I don't even know what I just attacked.

4389
03:31:26,900 --> 03:31:27,740
I'll take that.

4390
03:31:27,880 --> 03:31:28,740
Thank you very much.

4391
03:31:29,000 --> 03:31:33,020
Oh, oh

4392
03:31:40,820 --> 03:31:42,900
gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

4393
03:31:43,200 --> 03:31:43,940
Don't get...

4394
03:31:43,940 --> 03:31:45,220
Don't get...

4395
03:31:45,700 --> 03:31:46,920
The missiles are so good.

4396
03:31:47,100 --> 03:31:47,800
Holy moly.

4397
03:31:49,800 --> 03:31:50,880
This is the pillar.

4398
03:31:53,680 --> 03:31:55,020
Let's get some support drones.

4399
03:32:00,520 --> 03:32:04,720
If we want to talk meta, the drone meta, baby.

4400
03:32:07,400 --> 03:32:09,360
This is a nice spot to be in, maybe.

4401
03:32:12,080 --> 03:32:13,240
Look at all that bla...

4402
03:32:13,240 --> 03:32:15,280
Oh my god, there's so many girls up there!

4403
03:32:17,320 --> 03:32:18,200
Oh, flamethrowers!

4404
03:32:18,620 --> 03:32:19,500
There's two of them.

4405
03:32:27,120 --> 03:32:27,560
Yeah!

4406
03:32:27,660 --> 03:32:28,100
Yeah!

4407
03:32:28,720 --> 03:32:29,140
Yeah!

4408
03:32:31,600 --> 03:32:32,800
Drone meta is real.

4409
03:32:36,000 --> 03:32:36,900
Take them out!

4410
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:37,540
Take them out!

4411
03:32:37,560 --> 03:32:38,060
Take them out!

4412
03:32:39,600 --> 03:32:40,560
I'm so effective.

4413
03:32:40,740 --> 03:32:42,000
There's no one else to kill.

4414
03:32:42,220 --> 03:32:42,680
Oh, nice.

4415
03:32:51,640 --> 03:32:53,560
The drones should get cg art too.

4416
03:32:53,980 --> 03:32:54,680
So true.

4417
03:32:58,100 --> 03:32:59,780
Oop, I was not even... my bad.

4418
03:33:10,920 --> 03:33:15,640
I don't... because I don't like... you know, at least with the stage, I can have like a...

4419
03:33:17,700 --> 03:33:18,280
Oh gosh.

4420
03:33:23,520 --> 03:33:28,080
At least with the stage, I can have like a wall.

4421
03:33:31,340 --> 03:33:31,740
Nice.

4422
03:33:35,860 --> 03:33:36,680
I don't know.

4423
03:33:49,970 --> 03:33:50,410
Nice.

4424
03:33:50,590 --> 03:33:54,170
Here we go.

4425
03:33:54,350 --> 03:33:55,630
I like this area way better.

4426
03:33:56,430 --> 03:33:58,470
Because also the chairs kind of block them too.

4427
03:33:58,770 --> 03:34:01,310
This ends up being a pretty decent spot, I'd say.

4428
03:34:03,950 --> 03:34:06,490
Oh my gosh, look at all of them fuddling through here.

4429
03:34:08,150 --> 03:34:09,050
Come on, babies!

4430
03:34:11,470 --> 03:34:12,250
Oh no!

4431
03:34:12,390 --> 03:34:13,230
No, no, no!

4432
03:34:14,190 --> 03:34:15,170
Oh no, no, no!

4433
03:34:15,190 --> 03:34:17,310
Oh no, no, no!

4434
03:34:20,750 --> 03:34:25,310
I heal so fast though, I don't know why I'm even worried about taking damage.

4435
03:34:27,550 --> 03:34:35,850
I'd have to be like super... super tackled to be in a bad spot, you know?

4436
03:34:41,210 --> 03:34:42,570
Just stand still.

4437
03:34:42,830 --> 03:34:43,670
Yeah, pretty much.

4438
03:34:55,560 --> 03:34:58,000
And the missiles are OP, for real.

4439
03:35:03,700 --> 03:35:04,240
Oh!

4440
03:35:04,280 --> 03:35:04,920
Oh, she's here!

4441
03:35:05,040 --> 03:35:05,360
She's here!

4442
03:35:08,380 --> 03:35:09,220
She's here!

4443
03:35:09,300 --> 03:35:09,740
She's here!

4444
03:35:09,860 --> 03:35:10,260
She's here!

4445
03:35:15,700 --> 03:35:17,020
Oh, there she is!

4446
03:35:17,120 --> 03:35:18,260
Oh my god, stop!

4447
03:35:18,380 --> 03:35:19,900
She's the cutest ever!

4448
03:35:20,700 --> 03:35:21,240
Stop!

4449
03:35:21,420 --> 03:35:22,500
She's hopping at me!

4450
03:35:23,880 --> 03:35:25,880
Oh my god, she's perfect!

4451
03:35:28,200 --> 03:35:28,600
Oh!

4452
03:35:31,260 --> 03:35:33,700
I think almost all... Oh, got it.

4453
03:35:33,780 --> 03:35:34,340
Oh, got it.

4454
03:35:34,640 --> 03:35:35,860
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

4455
03:35:36,000 --> 03:35:40,840
Oh no, does that mean all of the bosses are gonna have the same fighting style?

4456
03:35:43,200 --> 03:35:43,880
I wonder.

4457
03:35:50,310 --> 03:35:51,330
Can you recruit her?

4458
03:35:51,470 --> 03:35:52,050
Yeah, baby!

4459
03:35:52,290 --> 03:35:53,350
That's what we're gonna do!

4460
03:35:58,510 --> 03:35:59,430
She's so cute.

4461
03:35:59,850 --> 03:36:01,270
I need her on my team.

4462
03:36:02,190 --> 03:36:03,150
I need her.

4463
03:36:03,190 --> 03:36:03,710
I need her.

4464
03:36:03,750 --> 03:36:04,270
I need her.

4465
03:36:04,730 --> 03:36:05,710
I need her.

4466
03:36:05,790 --> 03:36:06,230
I need her.

4467
03:36:06,290 --> 03:36:06,710
I need her.

4468
03:36:06,810 --> 03:36:06,950
I need her.

4469
03:36:07,630 --> 03:36:10,770
This game is very obviously not for the gameplay, though.

4470
03:36:11,710 --> 03:36:17,670
Because there's so much time in between her, like... between her doing this attack, you know?

4471
03:36:18,130 --> 03:36:19,950
Oh no, the little tiny missile!

4472
03:36:20,130 --> 03:36:20,790
Where did she go?

4473
03:36:20,790 --> 03:36:20,990
There she is.

4474
03:36:23,330 --> 03:36:24,230
She's like a Jiangshi.

4475
03:36:24,390 --> 03:36:24,650
I know!

4476
03:36:24,810 --> 03:36:25,370
It's so cute!

4477
03:36:30,480 --> 03:36:30,880
Yippee!

4478
03:36:32,640 --> 03:36:33,900
I saw your super chat.

4479
03:36:34,020 --> 03:36:34,700
What did you ask?

4480
03:36:36,280 --> 03:36:38,060
I always hated mint-flavored things.

4481
03:36:38,160 --> 03:36:40,300
Because of you, I gave it another chance and I actually like it now.

4482
03:36:42,080 --> 03:36:42,480
Yippee!

4483
03:36:44,300 --> 03:36:45,580
Time to cure everybody.

4484
03:36:48,640 --> 03:36:49,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

4485
03:36:49,920 --> 03:36:51,140
I brought Arisa-chan with me.

4486
03:36:52,240 --> 03:36:53,480
Time to cure.

4487
03:36:54,300 --> 03:36:55,360
Sorry to keep you waiting.

4488
03:36:55,540 --> 03:36:56,360
We got Arisa!

4489
03:37:01,100 --> 03:37:02,320
Lay her down here, please.

4490
03:37:02,500 --> 03:37:03,840
I'll start the procedure immediately.

4491
03:37:04,660 --> 03:37:06,900
I was in the same state as this girl.

4492
03:37:08,280 --> 03:37:12,120
When I think about it, I really think that being alive was a miracle.

4493
03:37:15,540 --> 03:37:17,700
I was in a similar state to her, right?

4494
03:37:17,920 --> 03:37:20,900
Thinking about it logically, it's a miracle that I was able to come to my senses.

4495
03:37:26,100 --> 03:37:27,640
I'm ready to dork it.

4496
03:37:28,180 --> 03:37:29,280
It'll all work out.

4497
03:37:29,580 --> 03:37:30,780
Kanon knows what she's doing.

4498
03:37:30,980 --> 03:37:32,240
You should know better than anyone.

4499
03:37:32,320 --> 03:37:32,760
Right, Rinka?

4500
03:37:37,140 --> 03:37:38,200
Yeah, you're right.

4501
03:37:38,600 --> 03:37:39,080
I'll do my best.

4502
03:37:40,500 --> 03:37:41,600
Let's start right away.

4503
03:37:42,280 --> 03:37:43,380
Let's pray for the best.

4504
03:37:43,480 --> 03:37:44,600
I'll begin the procedure.

4505
03:37:44,700 --> 03:37:47,000
The procedure should be in quotes.

4506
03:37:48,300 --> 03:37:48,960
Oh boy.

4507
03:37:49,140 --> 03:37:49,700
Oh boy.

4508
03:37:49,780 --> 03:37:50,160
Oh boy.

4509
03:37:53,320 --> 03:37:54,000
Let's pray for the best.

4510
03:37:54,000 --> 03:37:54,900
Oh, she's perfect!

4511
03:37:56,120 --> 03:37:56,660
I'll start the procedure.

4512
03:37:59,000 --> 03:37:59,680
Stop!

4513
03:37:59,920 --> 03:38:00,620
She's perfect!

4514
03:38:01,060 --> 03:38:02,280
Oh god!

4515
03:38:02,980 --> 03:38:05,680
Depart, depart, depart.

4516
03:38:06,420 --> 03:38:08,980
Oh god, she's so perfect!

4517
03:38:09,100 --> 03:38:10,360
No, don't do it!

4518
03:38:10,380 --> 03:38:11,320
Don't change her!

4519
03:38:11,440 --> 03:38:13,180
I love her as she is!

4520
03:38:14,060 --> 03:38:16,020
Oh god, she's so cute!

4521
03:38:16,340 --> 03:38:16,860
Oh no!

4522
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:19,220
She's so my type!

4523
03:38:19,280 --> 03:38:19,780
It hurts!

4524
03:38:21,140 --> 03:38:21,360
HAHAHA.

4525
03:38:22,660 --> 03:38:23,760
Giyu giyu giyu giyu.

4526
03:38:23,880 --> 03:38:28,140
Shuko Shuko Shuko Shuko Shuko Shuko Shuko Shuko Shuko Shuko Shuko.

4527
03:38:28,500 --> 03:38:29,960
Everybody let's shuko together!

4528
03:38:30,360 --> 03:38:32,920
Shuko Shuko Shuko Shuko Shuko Shuko Shuko...

4529
03:38:32,920 --> 03:38:34,520
OMG she is so cute!

4530
03:38:35,320 --> 03:38:37,320
She is so blue!

4531
03:38:37,540 --> 03:38:39,760
Her color palette is perfect the way it is.

4532
03:38:41,000 --> 03:38:41,680
Madison!

4533
03:38:41,680 --> 03:38:44,680
Shikou, shikou, shikou, shikou, shikou, shikou, shikou, shikou...

4534
03:38:45,450 --> 03:38:45,740
Medicine!

4535
03:39:04,120 --> 03:39:05,480
It's medicine, you guys.

4536
03:39:06,300 --> 03:39:08,000
This is a medicinal procedure.

4537
03:39:08,400 --> 03:39:10,820
I can't keep defending my Yoshi like this.

4538
03:39:12,540 --> 03:39:14,880
This is a medical procedure!

4539
03:39:20,900 --> 03:39:22,460
Shikou, shikou, shikou, shikou...

4540
03:39:22,460 --> 03:39:24,220
Shikou, shikou, shikou, shikou, shikou.

4541
03:39:25,760 --> 03:39:26,200
Shikou!

4542
03:39:26,200 --> 03:39:27,700
Shikou, shikou, shikou, shikou, shikou!

4543
03:39:28,260 --> 03:39:29,080
Shikou, shikou!

4544
03:39:29,680 --> 03:39:30,700
Shikou, shikou, shikou!

4545
03:39:31,540 --> 03:39:31,980
Medicine!

4546
03:39:34,000 --> 03:39:36,340
I like the way we just splatter it on her.

4547
03:39:37,180 --> 03:39:38,260
She's gonna cure!

4548
03:39:43,480 --> 03:39:44,840
Oh she's so cute!

4549
03:39:45,400 --> 03:39:48,160
Shikou, shikou, shikou, shikou...

4550
03:39:52,720 --> 03:39:53,460
That's right!

4551
03:39:53,760 --> 03:39:55,240
There's why you're the best boss!

4552
03:39:55,920 --> 03:39:56,440
Shuko!

4553
03:39:56,560 --> 03:39:56,900
Shuko!

4554
03:39:57,020 --> 03:39:57,320
Shuko!

4555
03:39:58,660 --> 03:39:59,180
Shuko!

4556
03:39:59,320 --> 03:39:59,700
Shuko!

4557
03:39:59,700 --> 03:39:59,900
Shuko!

4558
03:40:00,120 --> 03:40:01,040
Get cured!

4559
03:40:01,220 --> 03:40:01,720
Get cured!

4560
03:40:02,120 --> 03:40:02,620
Shuko!

4561
03:40:02,760 --> 03:40:03,040
Shuko!

4562
03:40:03,180 --> 03:40:03,480
Shuko!

4563
03:40:03,960 --> 03:40:04,480
Shuko!

4564
03:40:04,560 --> 03:40:04,820
Shuko!

4565
03:40:04,960 --> 03:40:05,280
Shuko!

4566
03:40:07,080 --> 03:40:07,600
Shuko!

4567
03:40:07,700 --> 03:40:08,000
Shuko!

4568
03:40:08,200 --> 03:40:08,460
Shuko!

4569
03:40:08,640 --> 03:40:08,920
Shuko!

4570
03:40:09,040 --> 03:40:09,220
Shuko!

4571
03:40:10,440 --> 03:40:11,740
Where'd the sharp teeth go?

4572
03:40:11,860 --> 03:40:13,720
I know, it's such a downgrade, isn't it?

4573
03:40:15,080 --> 03:40:16,360
Don't shuko too hard.

4574
03:40:16,700 --> 03:40:18,540
You might damage the vaccine bottle.

4575
03:40:18,540 --> 03:40:21,240
Sometimes I rip the skin.

4576
03:40:22,580 --> 03:40:23,820
Use medicine!

4577
03:40:27,340 --> 03:40:29,380
You know what's a really good part?

4578
03:40:29,540 --> 03:40:30,220
It's right here.

4579
03:40:31,840 --> 03:40:32,860
This right here.

4580
03:40:41,560 --> 03:40:43,840
What is this expression?

4581
03:40:50,480 --> 03:40:51,480
I wish I only had the tiny parts of Arisa.

4582
03:40:52,360 --> 03:40:52,740
Shuko!

4583
03:40:52,920 --> 03:40:53,040
Shuko!

4584
03:40:53,140 --> 03:40:53,340
Shuko!

4585
03:40:53,440 --> 03:40:53,740
Shuko!

4586
03:40:53,760 --> 03:40:53,840
Shuko!

4587
03:40:53,840 --> 03:40:53,940
Shuko!

4588
03:40:53,940 --> 03:40:53,960
Shuko!

4589
03:40:53,960 --> 03:40:54,180
Shuko!

4590
03:40:54,180 --> 03:40:54,200
Shuko!

4591
03:40:54,200 --> 03:40:54,200
Shuko!

4592
03:40:54,200 --> 03:40:54,320
Shuko!

4593
03:40:54,320 --> 03:40:54,460
Shuko!

4594
03:40:54,460 --> 03:40:54,460
Shuko!

4595
03:40:54,460 --> 03:40:54,460
Shuko!

4596
03:40:54,460 --> 03:40:54,840
Shuko!

4597
03:40:54,840 --> 03:40:54,840
Shuko!

4598
03:40:54,840 --> 03:40:54,840
Shuko!

4599
03:40:54,840 --> 03:40:54,940
Shuko!

4600
03:40:54,940 --> 03:40:54,940
Shuko!

4601
03:40:54,940 --> 03:40:54,940
Shuko!

4602
03:40:54,940 --> 03:40:54,940
Shuko!

4603
03:40:54,940 --> 03:40:54,940
Shuko!

4604
03:40:54,940 --> 03:40:54,940
Shuko!

4605
03:40:54,940 --> 03:40:54,940
Shuko!

4606
03:40:54,940 --> 03:40:55,220
Shuko!

4607
03:40:55,380 --> 03:40:55,760
Shuko!

4608
03:41:00,700 --> 03:41:01,080
Shuko!

4609
03:41:01,080 --> 03:41:01,160
Shuko!

4610
03:41:01,160 --> 03:41:03,280
In the end we were only able to save Arisa, huh?

4611
03:41:03,580 --> 03:41:05,980
Even though there were others there...

4612
03:41:08,770 --> 03:41:09,790
We became zombies.

4613
03:41:11,230 --> 03:41:12,110
I had no choice.

4614
03:41:12,850 --> 03:41:16,070
I thought there might be more survivors but it seems they were all turned into zombies.

4615
03:41:16,470 --> 03:41:17,230
You don't need to worry about it.

4616
03:41:18,610 --> 03:41:18,990
Rather, you should be happy that we got me out.

4617
03:41:18,990 --> 03:41:20,390
It was a triumph of a digital art.

4618
03:41:23,150 --> 03:41:24,270
Please don't blame yourselves.

4619
03:41:24,270 --> 03:41:27,470
In fact, we should be happy that we were able to save Ms. Arisa.

4620
03:41:30,430 --> 03:41:32,150
So, Arisa also had the antibodies.

4621
03:41:40,590 --> 03:41:44,870
And because of them, she was able to prolong the zombification process compared to the average victim.

4622
03:41:45,150 --> 03:41:52,250
Wow, it seems like... what are the odds that three people in Akihabara all have the antibodies?

4623
03:41:56,530 --> 03:41:57,610
Like, what are the odds?

4624
03:42:01,010 --> 03:42:01,390
Anime.

4625
03:42:03,410 --> 03:42:05,790
I wonder how many people out there have these antibodies.

4626
03:42:09,870 --> 03:42:11,410
Yeah, me too!

4627
03:42:11,570 --> 03:42:12,470
I've been wondering about that!

4628
03:42:15,970 --> 03:42:16,350
Right!

4629
03:42:20,930 --> 03:42:22,850
When you think of it, shouldn't there be more people?

4630
03:42:23,090 --> 03:42:24,930
Only having the three of us seems like too few.

4631
03:42:25,830 --> 03:42:27,070
All of these digital media.

4632
03:42:28,770 --> 03:42:30,070
Made armor real.

4633
03:42:34,550 --> 03:42:36,230
But the odds are pretty low.

4634
03:42:36,830 --> 03:42:38,730
Oh, I can't be certain, but the odds are pretty low.

4635
03:42:38,950 --> 03:42:43,210
It'd be something like 1 in 10,000 or 1 in 100,000.

4636
03:42:45,210 --> 03:42:45,910
I'd win.

4637
03:42:46,750 --> 03:42:48,130
Give me them gotcha rates.

4638
03:42:48,470 --> 03:42:50,790
Ms. Arisa's existence is like a miracle.

4639
03:42:50,790 --> 03:42:51,310
It's like a miracle.

4640
03:42:54,950 --> 03:42:55,470
Sorry.

4641
03:42:56,490 --> 03:42:58,810
Ms. Nagisa, Ms. Rinka, and Ms. Arisa.

4642
03:42:59,030 --> 03:43:04,290
The odds of the three of you were in the same area during a pandemic like this is nothing short of a miracle.

4643
03:43:05,170 --> 03:43:05,730
That's right.

4644
03:43:06,670 --> 03:43:07,190
Miracle.

4645
03:43:08,090 --> 03:43:10,510
I am the chosen one in this world!

4646
03:43:11,270 --> 03:43:13,810
Oh no, she's perfect!

4647
03:43:14,430 --> 03:43:16,770
Yes, it is indeed a miracle.

4648
03:43:17,070 --> 03:43:19,370
I was one of the chosen ones after all!

4649
03:43:34,050 --> 03:43:34,990
Oh my god.

4650
03:43:36,550 --> 03:43:37,530
I am the chosen one!

4651
03:43:54,360 --> 03:43:55,280
She's perfect.

4652
03:43:57,880 --> 03:43:59,000
Thank you for the gift!

4653
03:44:00,060 --> 03:44:03,040
Fifty Gifted Wandering Taco, thank you!

4654
03:44:05,640 --> 03:44:07,520
Okay, fine, I will now buy this game.

4655
03:44:20,570 --> 03:44:21,810
You seem to know my name.

4656
03:44:25,970 --> 03:44:29,150
As expected, I am the chosen one in this world.

4657
03:44:30,030 --> 03:44:32,510
Oh, it appears you know my name.

4658
03:44:33,530 --> 03:44:35,850
Proof that I am indeed one of the chosen few.

4659
03:44:36,270 --> 03:44:38,390
You guys saved me, didn't you?

4660
03:44:38,870 --> 03:44:39,730
I am grateful.

4661
03:44:40,770 --> 03:44:44,150
No matter how chosen you are, you are still dead.

4662
03:44:45,950 --> 03:44:48,190
You peasants rescued me, correct?

4663
03:44:50,250 --> 03:44:51,590
Thank you for the gift!

4664
03:44:51,810 --> 03:44:54,010
Thank you for the gift!

4665
03:44:54,110 --> 03:44:54,450
Thank you for the gift!

4666
03:44:55,890 --> 03:44:58,190
I offer you my thanks.

4667
03:44:58,450 --> 03:45:03,650
Though I am a child of destiny, even I have my limits and would have died without your assistance.

4668
03:45:04,870 --> 03:45:06,330
Zombies came rushing in during the live show.

4669
03:45:06,610 --> 03:45:08,330
It is true that I sympathize with you.

4670
03:45:08,710 --> 03:45:12,310
In a blink of an eye, even my followers became zombies.

4671
03:45:13,750 --> 03:45:14,710
Take off!

4672
03:45:14,770 --> 03:45:16,270
Take off the gift!

4673
03:45:18,250 --> 03:45:20,310
I hope work wasn't too hard for you.

4674
03:45:20,930 --> 03:45:22,570
She just called us peasants.

4675
03:45:22,730 --> 03:45:23,110
Yeah.

4676
03:45:23,110 --> 03:45:25,050
And I wish she'd do it again.

4677
03:45:26,870 --> 03:45:29,070
During our live, the zombies swarmed in.

4678
03:45:29,250 --> 03:45:31,010
It was utter pandemonium.

4679
03:45:31,210 --> 03:45:34,230
Our worshippers succumbed to the virus in mere seconds.

4680
03:45:34,550 --> 03:45:36,030
I was able to hide myself from a few of my followers.

4681
03:45:37,530 --> 03:45:40,070
But the followers who were ruled by fear...

4682
03:45:40,070 --> 03:45:40,910
Yes, my master!

4683
03:45:41,430 --> 03:45:42,010
...went away one by one.

4684
03:45:43,450 --> 03:45:44,930
Welcome back, Kuroneko.

4685
03:45:46,450 --> 03:45:49,690
At first, I was able to hide among several loyal followers.

4686
03:45:50,010 --> 03:45:52,750
But soon, they could no longer resist their fear.

4687
03:45:53,110 --> 03:45:54,890
And one after the other, ran away.

4688
03:45:55,130 --> 03:45:56,890
Oh, doesn't sound very loyal at all.

4689
03:46:01,010 --> 03:46:01,910
They ran away?

4690
03:46:02,070 --> 03:46:03,270
Like, leaving you all alone?

4691
03:46:04,810 --> 03:46:05,690
Shunin made...

4692
03:46:05,690 --> 03:46:07,030
Mint, what have you unleashed?

4693
03:46:11,370 --> 03:46:12,530
What a humble person.

4694
03:46:12,630 --> 03:46:13,870
I must dedicate my life.

4695
03:46:15,850 --> 03:46:18,150
I'm sure in their minds, it was a tactical retreat.

4696
03:46:18,510 --> 03:46:21,310
Though most of them had lost the capacity for rational thought.

4697
03:46:21,310 --> 03:46:22,150
I have no intention of attacking them.

4698
03:46:24,730 --> 03:46:28,550
If I say I didn't feel any fear, that would be a lie.

4699
03:46:30,270 --> 03:46:32,450
Her voice sounds kind of like...

4700
03:46:33,330 --> 03:46:34,110
Tsukino Mito.

4701
03:46:36,770 --> 03:46:39,630
I cannot condemn those brave young men and women.

4702
03:46:39,750 --> 03:46:42,830
For even I felt an ounce of fear seep into my bones.

4703
03:46:44,750 --> 03:46:47,030
My Oshii is a simp like me, for real, for real.

4704
03:46:47,210 --> 03:46:49,630
So which maid is so far the cutest besides you?

4705
03:46:49,630 --> 03:46:51,590
Do you have to ask?

4706
03:47:01,150 --> 03:47:02,630
So, let me get this straight.

4707
03:47:02,770 --> 03:47:04,930
You were the one that shot off the fireworks, right?

4708
03:47:11,570 --> 03:47:15,250
You guys hear it, right?

4709
03:47:15,490 --> 03:47:16,170
So funny.

4710
03:47:17,270 --> 03:47:18,110
That is correct.

4711
03:47:19,630 --> 03:47:20,010
Umma!

4712
03:47:21,150 --> 03:47:21,650
Umma!

4713
03:47:21,930 --> 03:47:25,490
I had exhausted all of the resources and was left no choice.

4714
03:47:25,710 --> 03:47:28,930
But in the end, it ended up being a beacon for those cursed beings.

4715
03:47:29,350 --> 03:47:32,450
In the end, I was surrounded, and I understood the end.

4716
03:47:33,750 --> 03:47:37,550
But now that I have survived, there is no problem at all.

4717
03:47:38,010 --> 03:47:40,530
I thought I had met my end when they surrounded me.

4718
03:47:40,650 --> 03:47:43,370
But the fact that I am here now speaks a great deal.

4719
03:47:44,630 --> 03:47:45,130
Umma!

4720
03:47:45,370 --> 03:47:46,470
You are quite...

4721
03:47:46,470 --> 03:47:47,950
You are quite...

4722
03:47:49,830 --> 03:47:51,890
You seem to be a rather strange individual.

4723
03:47:54,710 --> 03:47:56,710
More like she is delusional.

4724
03:48:00,130 --> 03:48:00,570
Thank

4725
03:48:05,200 --> 03:48:05,640
you!

4726
03:48:05,720 --> 03:48:06,500
How do I say your name?

4727
03:48:06,660 --> 03:48:07,100
As...

4728
03:48:07,600 --> 03:48:08,040
Afic?

4729
03:48:08,380 --> 03:48:08,820
Asfix?

4730
03:48:10,140 --> 03:48:12,520
These maids are pretty cute, but Mint is still the cutest one.

4731
03:48:12,680 --> 03:48:13,240
Stop it!

4732
03:48:16,240 --> 03:48:16,680
Stop.

4733
03:48:17,080 --> 03:48:17,680
Stop it.

4734
03:48:18,640 --> 03:48:20,700
You really are unique, aren't you, Arisa?

4735
03:48:21,080 --> 03:48:22,300
That's what makes you adorable.

4736
03:48:24,260 --> 03:48:25,680
You must be shocked, aren't you?

4737
03:48:26,400 --> 03:48:28,040
You lost a friend from the same idol group.

4738
03:48:30,040 --> 03:48:30,500
Oh.

4739
03:48:30,800 --> 03:48:32,700
I bet it was a major shock for you, though.

4740
03:48:32,720 --> 03:48:35,460
I mean, you lost all your friends who were in the same idol group, right?

4741
03:48:35,780 --> 03:48:38,320
Unfortunately, I don't think so.

4742
03:48:39,100 --> 03:48:43,160
We were friends who swore to save the world through singing.

4743
03:48:44,180 --> 03:48:46,300
I shall never forget the fallen.

4744
03:48:46,720 --> 03:48:48,020
For they were my comrades.

4745
03:48:48,320 --> 03:48:51,720
And arms were yours bent on saving the world through song.

4746
03:48:52,080 --> 03:48:52,540
But...

4747
03:48:52,540 --> 03:48:54,340
What are you sad about?

4748
03:48:55,700 --> 03:48:57,160
I have accepted their souls.

4749
03:48:59,980 --> 03:49:01,660
People died, Arisa.

4750
03:49:03,960 --> 03:49:05,100
People died.

4751
03:49:06,580 --> 03:49:09,300
It's so tragic that she has brain damage now, right?

4752
03:49:10,680 --> 03:49:12,520
But there's nothing to be saddened about.

4753
03:49:12,820 --> 03:49:14,640
Their souls still live on within me.

4754
03:49:15,200 --> 03:49:17,460
You're strong, Arisa-chan.

4755
03:49:17,900 --> 03:49:19,340
You're strong, Arisa.

4756
03:49:19,500 --> 03:49:20,260
Mm-hmm.

4757
03:49:20,260 --> 03:49:23,420
It's only natural that you're chosen to save the world.

4758
03:49:25,520 --> 03:49:27,980
Hehe, that I am.

4759
03:49:28,060 --> 03:49:32,300
That's why I'm the child of destiny who will one day save this planet.

4760
03:49:32,640 --> 03:49:33,480
But...

4761
03:49:35,910 --> 03:49:36,890
Hold it.

4762
03:49:36,990 --> 03:49:38,150
I just realized.

4763
03:49:39,770 --> 03:49:40,610
Oh?

4764
03:49:42,510 --> 03:49:43,350
Oh?

4765
03:49:44,730 --> 03:49:45,570
Oh?

4766
03:49:46,230 --> 03:49:47,630
Are you...

4767
03:49:47,630 --> 03:49:49,510
Zombie Hunters?

4768
03:49:49,510 --> 03:49:52,950
Are there no blonde-haired ninjas among your friends?

4769
03:49:53,830 --> 03:49:54,430
What?

4770
03:49:55,090 --> 03:49:56,950
You two are Zombie Hunters, correct?

4771
03:49:57,190 --> 03:50:00,030
Are you not working with a blonde-haired ninja?

4772
03:50:00,750 --> 03:50:01,350
What?

4773
03:50:03,150 --> 03:50:04,410
What are you talking about?

4774
03:50:04,890 --> 03:50:05,710
Come again?

4775
03:50:06,570 --> 03:50:07,670
You're that ninja.

4776
03:50:08,010 --> 03:50:08,590
You're talking about that kind of thing, aren't you?

4777
03:50:08,830 --> 03:50:10,430
Must be another one of her delusions.

4778
03:50:10,730 --> 03:50:11,010
No!

4779
03:50:11,810 --> 03:50:13,750
Where there's a zombie, there's her!

4780
03:50:14,150 --> 03:50:14,390
No!

4781
03:50:15,250 --> 03:50:16,710
She's the one who saves people from zombies!

4782
03:50:18,330 --> 03:50:20,550
There's a lady who appears when zombies approach!

4783
03:50:20,810 --> 03:50:22,250
A true savior for humanity!

4784
03:50:23,350 --> 03:50:23,870
Naruto!

4785
03:50:28,750 --> 03:50:31,690
She saved you, but then left you to die, apparently.

4786
03:50:33,330 --> 03:50:36,730
She saved my life, but immediately vanished without stating her name.

4787
03:50:36,990 --> 03:50:42,290
Well, after that, I was surrounded by zombies again, and I had no other choice but to hide.

4788
03:50:43,930 --> 03:50:45,950
Shortly after, I was cornered once again.

4789
03:50:45,950 --> 03:50:47,150
Leading me to go into hiding.

4790
03:50:47,430 --> 03:50:49,510
I heard that saving people is not your goal.

4791
03:50:49,870 --> 03:50:50,430
Believe it.

4792
03:50:51,270 --> 03:50:54,630
If that's the case, you won't leave survivors behind, will you?

4793
03:50:54,870 --> 03:50:55,510
Yeah, true.

4794
03:50:56,350 --> 03:50:58,130
Perhaps her motives aren't to save people.

4795
03:50:58,370 --> 03:51:01,490
I mean, if she was trying to do that, she would have gotten you to safety, right?

4796
03:51:01,770 --> 03:51:02,670
I wonder...

4797
03:51:03,410 --> 03:51:06,810
A blonde ninja...

4798
03:51:06,810 --> 03:51:08,230
A blonde ninja...

4799
03:51:08,230 --> 03:51:09,810
It might be the result of the situation.

4800
03:51:11,310 --> 03:51:12,750
We can't say that for certain.

4801
03:51:12,930 --> 03:51:15,250
It's difficult to carry someone to safety while moving.

4802
03:51:15,250 --> 03:51:18,550
She might have just done what she was capable of at the time.

4803
03:51:20,550 --> 03:51:23,250
Hmm, something seems off...

4804
03:51:23,250 --> 03:51:26,970
But that's

4805
03:51:30,060 --> 03:51:30,340
awesome!

4806
03:51:30,520 --> 03:51:33,080
There's someone else, other than us, that's fighting the zombies!

4807
03:51:33,400 --> 03:51:37,560
Besides, the way I heard about Arisa-chan, she's a very strong person.

4808
03:51:37,980 --> 03:51:41,740
If we have the same goal, we can become friends, right?

4809
03:51:42,080 --> 03:51:45,780
And hearing your story, Arisa, she seems to be an incredible fighter.

4810
03:51:45,780 --> 03:51:48,340
Maybe we can befriend her since we have similar goals!

4811
03:51:49,700 --> 03:51:50,260
Doki?

4812
03:51:51,860 --> 03:51:53,080
Doki's not a ninja.

4813
03:51:55,840 --> 03:51:57,340
Doki ninja outfit win.

4814
03:51:58,160 --> 03:51:59,560
She's a western ninja.

4815
03:52:02,540 --> 03:52:05,600
Would cowboys be considered western ninjas, maybe?

4816
03:52:05,900 --> 03:52:06,460
Yet.

4817
03:52:10,590 --> 03:52:16,050
Putting our motives aside for one second, the fact that she can fight zombies might mean she's a normal human either.

4818
03:52:19,190 --> 03:52:19,630
Maybe.

4819
03:52:20,710 --> 03:52:21,150
Maybe.

4820
03:52:21,150 --> 03:52:22,290
No, they're western samurai.

4821
03:52:22,510 --> 03:52:25,230
Oh, you're right, you're right, you're right, they're western samurai.

4822
03:52:25,690 --> 03:52:26,630
True, true, true.

4823
03:52:28,010 --> 03:52:29,350
A person with antibodies.

4824
03:52:29,730 --> 03:52:31,530
She might even be like you, Miss Nagisa.

4825
03:52:31,910 --> 03:52:33,450
Never having undergone transformation.

4826
03:52:39,950 --> 03:52:44,430
And perhaps it's as Miss Nagisa said, she might actually cooperate with us.

4827
03:52:44,830 --> 03:52:45,970
What should we do, Nagisa?

4828
03:52:46,990 --> 03:52:47,790
What should we do?

4829
03:52:48,310 --> 03:52:49,330
There's no need to ask.

4830
03:52:51,470 --> 03:52:52,470
What's the plan, Nagisa?

4831
03:52:52,770 --> 03:52:54,070
Heh, who am I kidding?

4832
03:52:54,270 --> 03:52:55,310
I already know your answer.

4833
03:52:57,570 --> 03:52:57,650
Please!

4834
03:53:00,730 --> 03:53:03,550
I don't want to be a grammar police, but please!

4835
03:53:06,630 --> 03:53:07,030
Please!

4836
03:53:11,670 --> 03:53:13,110
Of course, I'll go look for her.

4837
03:53:16,410 --> 03:53:18,310
Of course, we're gonna go look for her.

4838
03:53:18,430 --> 03:53:19,990
But what's that saying?

4839
03:53:20,010 --> 03:53:20,770
The more the merrier?

4840
03:53:21,410 --> 03:53:23,250
Oh, you're going to go look for that blonde ninja?

4841
03:53:24,250 --> 03:53:25,430
You are answer.

4842
03:53:25,670 --> 03:53:27,910
Of course, I'll go with you.

4843
03:53:27,910 --> 03:53:28,230
Of course, I'll go with you.

4844
03:53:29,610 --> 03:53:30,750
You are answer.

4845
03:53:30,870 --> 03:53:31,870
You are answer!

4846
03:53:33,810 --> 03:53:35,090
So it shall be then.

4847
03:53:35,190 --> 03:53:37,910
Allow me to join you on the search for the blonde haired ninja.

4848
03:53:38,210 --> 03:53:38,430
What?

4849
03:53:38,910 --> 03:53:39,690
No need to worry.

4850
03:53:41,170 --> 03:53:41,750
I'll choose again.

4851
03:53:41,750 --> 03:53:43,410
You are the chosen one.

4852
03:53:44,330 --> 03:53:46,450
I won't let you go like a zombie anymore.

4853
03:53:47,270 --> 03:53:48,990
Do not fret, my comrades.

4854
03:53:49,270 --> 03:53:50,510
I am the chosen one.

4855
03:53:50,710 --> 03:53:53,330
I will never fall to those zombie scum.

4856
03:54:03,670 --> 03:54:04,190
Scum.

4857
03:54:08,790 --> 03:54:10,790
Arisa Hika... Hikami.

4858
03:54:11,010 --> 03:54:11,950
Oh, sorry.

4859
03:54:12,310 --> 03:54:13,370
I thought it was like one word.

4860
03:54:13,370 --> 03:54:14,650
Arisa Hikami.

4861
03:54:16,090 --> 03:54:16,850
Nice.

4862
03:54:17,130 --> 03:54:18,070
Headband A?

4863
03:54:22,070 --> 03:54:23,610
What's headband A mean?

4864
03:54:31,590 --> 03:54:33,110
She's so cute.

4865
03:54:33,650 --> 03:54:34,670
Let me touch her.

4866
03:54:34,970 --> 03:54:35,710
Are you interested in my face?

4867
03:54:36,550 --> 03:54:37,050
Yeah.

4868
03:54:37,610 --> 03:54:38,730
Idols are not lame.

4869
03:54:38,730 --> 03:54:39,270
Idols are not lame.

4870
03:54:41,350 --> 03:54:43,150
Juni Minto for Halloween special win.

4871
03:54:46,910 --> 03:54:48,350
Are you interested in my face?

4872
03:54:50,450 --> 03:54:51,470
Idols are not lame.

4873
03:54:52,550 --> 03:54:52,830
Yeah.

4874
03:54:55,410 --> 03:54:57,410
If you touch me until you feel like it.

4875
03:54:58,270 --> 03:54:58,830
No.

4876
03:54:59,970 --> 03:55:01,390
Wait, I can touch your feet.

4877
03:55:02,450 --> 03:55:03,010
What?

4878
03:55:03,850 --> 03:55:05,230
Touching the feet does nothing?

4879
03:55:14,190 --> 03:55:15,290
Are you interested in my face?

4880
03:55:15,290 --> 03:55:16,090
Are you interested in my face?

4881
03:55:17,430 --> 03:55:18,230
Idols are not lame.

4882
03:55:18,950 --> 03:55:19,430
No.

4883
03:55:29,500 --> 03:55:31,440
No reaction to the feet.

4884
03:55:31,980 --> 03:55:32,720
You know what?

4885
03:55:32,780 --> 03:55:34,080
It's to make it fair, you guys.

4886
03:55:34,400 --> 03:55:35,520
It's to make it fair.

4887
03:55:36,900 --> 03:55:38,620
Because we can't touch their feet.

4888
03:55:40,020 --> 03:55:44,620
It would be unfair if she reacted to her feet and we wouldn't be able to touch any other feet.

4889
03:55:45,940 --> 03:55:46,600
You know?

4890
03:55:47,800 --> 03:55:48,280
Hm?

4891
03:55:50,990 --> 03:55:51,470
Hm?

4892
03:55:52,050 --> 03:55:54,210
Well, guys.

4893
03:55:54,210 --> 03:55:56,190
I have another collab in about an hour.

4894
03:55:56,390 --> 03:55:58,730
So I think that's where we're gonna leave it off here.

4895
03:55:59,410 --> 03:56:01,130
Just gonna save just in case.

4896
03:56:05,510 --> 03:56:06,430
Game saved.

4897
03:56:07,010 --> 03:56:08,390
We got three girls.

4898
03:56:08,790 --> 03:56:09,410
Who was...

4899
03:56:11,570 --> 03:56:12,610
Who also...

4900
03:56:13,530 --> 03:56:15,210
How do I get to the main menu?

4901
03:56:22,050 --> 03:56:22,810
There's even...

4902
03:56:22,810 --> 03:56:24,550
There's a lot of sub stores too.

4903
03:56:24,710 --> 03:56:26,130
Oh, there's a lot of sub stores.

4904
03:56:26,130 --> 03:56:26,850
Wow.

4905
03:56:29,170 --> 03:56:30,850
The harem is taking shape.

4906
03:56:31,790 --> 03:56:33,970
And we have a headband we can buy now.

4907
03:56:34,170 --> 03:56:34,830
How much is it?

4908
03:56:34,990 --> 03:56:35,670
Oh, gosh.

4909
03:56:36,850 --> 03:56:37,890
Titan silver.

4910
03:56:40,850 --> 03:56:42,550
So I have enough Titan silver.

4911
03:56:42,690 --> 03:56:43,550
I just need...

4912
03:56:44,450 --> 03:56:45,670
I need the...

4913
03:56:45,670 --> 03:56:46,950
The money.

4914
03:56:47,910 --> 03:56:50,070
Oh, I'm close to 20,000 though.

4915
03:56:50,090 --> 03:56:51,190
I'm close, actually.

4916
03:56:52,850 --> 03:56:53,610
Increases attack.

4917
03:56:54,150 --> 03:56:55,690
Increases power and point growth.

4918
03:56:56,430 --> 03:56:57,130
Houdou deuxième victorie dans le point de sortie Mm...

4919
03:56:59,110 --> 03:57:01,650
But yeah, this has been so much fun!

4920
03:57:02,010 --> 03:57:03,330
This has been so much fun.

4921
03:57:03,590 --> 03:57:04,850
Oh, my gosh.

4922
03:57:04,870 --> 03:57:07,730
I just noticed that Nagisa has like a half...

4923
03:57:08,470 --> 03:57:09,510
A half...

4924
03:57:10,550 --> 03:57:11,590
Nakada-kun

4925
03:57:15,890 --> 03:57:16,970
Everybody's so cute!

4926
03:57:17,510 --> 03:57:19,130
All of them are so cute!

4927
03:57:19,370 --> 03:57:20,850
All of them are so cute!

4928
03:57:21,210 --> 03:57:22,390
Nakada-kun

4929
03:57:27,550 --> 03:57:28,990
Thank you for the streaming, though.

4930
03:57:29,050 --> 03:57:29,370
Thank you!

4931
03:57:29,490 --> 03:57:37,730
Thanks guys for hanging out with me, allowing me to play this silly little, uh, little, um, ecchi game about maids and zombies.

4932
03:57:38,770 --> 03:57:40,010
My favorite things ever.

4933
03:57:41,350 --> 03:57:42,750
How do I go back to the main menu?

4934
03:57:44,490 --> 03:57:45,110
No, no, no.

4935
03:57:45,170 --> 03:57:46,150
Back, back, back, back.

4936
03:57:49,770 --> 03:57:50,150
Help!

4937
03:57:50,730 --> 03:57:51,690
Oh, return the title!

4938
03:57:51,790 --> 03:57:52,090
There we go.

4939
03:57:53,910 --> 03:57:55,210
Let's see, who else do we have?

4940
03:57:55,770 --> 03:57:56,550
Oh, there's our ninja!

4941
03:57:57,310 --> 03:57:59,070
And there's Onesa.

4942
03:57:59,890 --> 03:58:00,430
Holy...

4943
03:58:03,930 --> 03:58:06,050
There's a ghost maid and beast tamer?

4944
03:58:06,210 --> 03:58:06,630
What?

4945
03:58:06,730 --> 03:58:07,250
No way!

4946
03:58:20,930 --> 03:58:21,470
Wow.

4947
03:58:21,470 --> 03:58:22,010
Wow.

4948
03:58:22,950 --> 03:58:24,910
Wait, she uses a chainsaw!

4949
03:58:25,310 --> 03:58:26,850
She's even more perfect!

4950
03:58:27,230 --> 03:58:28,990
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

4951
03:58:28,990 --> 03:58:31,570
Oh gosh, I can't wait to play as her!

4952
03:58:31,770 --> 03:58:33,690
Oh gosh, I can't wait to play as her.

4953
03:58:34,330 --> 03:58:34,730
Um...

4954
03:58:42,090 --> 03:58:44,230
This song makes me just wanna headbang, you know?

4955
03:58:45,210 --> 03:58:46,630
She packs a chainsaw!

4956
03:58:48,750 --> 03:58:50,290
Oh, and like, the shine.

4957
03:58:50,490 --> 03:58:51,730
Oh my gosh, so awesome!

4958
03:58:53,210 --> 03:58:53,950
Best character.

4959
03:58:55,530 --> 03:58:57,770
Look at... I think they need to get new uniforms.

4960
03:58:58,390 --> 03:58:59,870
They're about to bust out of these.

4961
03:59:01,070 --> 03:59:02,950
But also, Bustin' makes me feel good.

4962
03:59:04,410 --> 03:59:06,790
Anyways guys, thanks for Maid of the Dead!

4963
03:59:07,870 --> 03:59:10,450
We'll probably continue it eventually.

4964
03:59:10,770 --> 03:59:11,430
I don't know when.

4965
03:59:11,530 --> 03:59:13,090
Probably sometime in Japan, you know?

4966
03:59:14,270 --> 03:59:18,610
And yeah, I'm gonna go get some food before the next collab.

4967
03:59:18,750 --> 03:59:22,430
In the pinned message, you'll see that I'm collabing with Berry and Ashton.

4968
03:59:22,570 --> 03:59:30,150
Later on, we'll be being silly, goofy... Disney adults.

4969
03:59:31,630 --> 03:59:32,150
So...

4970
03:59:33,650 --> 03:59:34,650
Great stream, Minto!

4971
03:59:34,810 --> 03:59:35,390
Thank you!

4972
03:59:38,110 --> 03:59:38,910
And um...

4973
03:59:39,510 --> 03:59:39,910
Yeah!

4974
03:59:41,170 --> 03:59:43,290
I'm gonna go get some stuff for my throat, even.

4975
03:59:43,430 --> 03:59:44,710
Gonna drink some throat tea.

4976
03:59:44,870 --> 03:59:45,790
And get some dinner.

4977
03:59:46,050 --> 03:59:47,550
I suggest you guys do the same.

4978
03:59:47,730 --> 03:59:48,610
And I'll see you guys later!

4979
03:59:48,710 --> 03:59:50,230
Thank you so much for watching me!

4980
03:59:50,450 --> 03:59:52,110
I know it was really, really early.

4981
03:59:52,210 --> 03:59:53,730
Different from my time, usually.

4982
03:59:53,870 --> 03:59:57,790
But I appreciate you watching and hanging out with me today!

4983
03:59:59,310 --> 04:00:00,110
Thank you!

4984
04:00:00,110 --> 04:00:00,410
Thank you!

4985
04:00:01,530 --> 04:00:02,970
I'll see you guys later!

4986
04:00:03,190 --> 04:00:03,830
Thank you!

4987
04:00:04,710 --> 04:00:05,610
Thank you!

4988
04:00:05,790 --> 04:00:06,750
Thank you, Ashton!

4989
04:00:06,810 --> 04:00:07,770
Thank you...

4990
04:00:08,370 --> 04:00:09,310
Thank you, Minto!

4991
04:00:10,510 --> 04:00:13,390
See you later!

4992
04:00:13,750 --> 04:00:14,130
Bye bye!

4993
04:00:15,330 --> 04:00:16,590
See you guys later!

4994
04:00:16,750 --> 04:00:17,290
Bye bye!
