1
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,640
Maybe doing a karaoke was a mistake, but it's okay.

2
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,420
My throat will heal eventually one day.

3
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,760

I've seen many groups in concert, mostly 80 bands with my
dad.

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,400
I enjoyed all of them but I enjoyed last night the most.

Thank you for the 10 gifts and thank you.

23
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,800
Dempogumi Inc.

24
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,680
is like, they have been my life force.

25
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,500
Maybe that's the reason why I'm a ghost, because I have to
stick around.

26
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,140
I can't go to heaven because I can't move on.

27
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,900
I can't move on.

28
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
Maybe I don't want to go to heaven.

29
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,300
I can't move on because I just want to stay with Dempogumi.

30
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,800
I really hoping this doesn't affect your detokun too much.

31
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,660
She'll be around in me in Tokyo, but I worry.

32
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,800
I think she'll be okay.

33
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,200
King Krono!

34
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,300
Thank you for the vibe gifted!

35
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,040
I...

36
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,300
Um...

37
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,900
I...

38
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,140
I...

39
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,500
Uh...

40
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,140
Started as...

41
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,380
So just to give you guys a background of some Dempagumi
stuff.

42
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,160
Thank you for the 10 gifts.

43
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:35,720
They come from a cafe in Akihabara called Deer Stage, which
I love Deer Stage so much.

44
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,960
I love Deer Stage so much.

45
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,280
It's an idol cafe and bar, and they do performances and
stuff almost daily.

46
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:55,420
And it's like kind of legendary in Akihabara, especially
because, you know, Dempagumi came from there and Dempagumi

47
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:04,380
is such a beloved idol group like there are probably some
idols that would not be idols if it were for it weren't for

48
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:16,540
Dempagumi like I have pictures of Ano you know Ano from uh
she did the chainsaw men ending she has she loves like NEMU

49
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,760
which which was my Oshi.

50
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,380
Like, she has pictures with Nemu.

51
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:31,100
Like, there are idols who, who, like, became, like, mini
versions of Dempagumi members.

52
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,900
So they are trendsetters.

53
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,780
There are so much more than that.

54
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,100
They're, like, I don't know.

55
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,900
They've, they just have such an impact on the, on not just,
I wouldn't even just say the idol world.

56
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,920
I would say the entertainment industry.

57
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,260
in Japan as a whole.

58
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,660
Have a fun stream, Minto!

59
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,560
We'll definitely watch the VOD, but now it's asleep before
work.

60
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,060
Good luck with work!

61
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,060
I wonder if Mint wouldn't be so minty without Deer Stage.

62
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
I don't think so.

63
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:08,760
Because my Oshi, Yumami Nemu, she was the Mint member of the
group.

64
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,080
And she is the reason why I became to love the color mint so
much in general.

65
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,020
So,

66
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:32,120
Yeah, so a lot of even what I do is always been influenced
by Dempagumi.

67
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,720
And just the way that I love idols and the way that I love
Akihabara has been influenced by Dempagumi.

68
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:48,900
So I truly, I truly like, it's not an exaggeration when I
say that I wouldn't be the ghost that I am today if it

69
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,660
wasn't for them.

70
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,000
So, you know, it's so awesome.

71
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:10,940
Moga is the most important to you.

72
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,740
Yeah, they're like the most important to me ever.

73
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:23,720
And so, I know that we have, or I still have some time with
them, but I wanted to do this karaoke kind of early because

74
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:32,680
I was like, maybe if I get you guys into Dempagumi too, if
you go to Japan and you have a chance to see them, maybe

75
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,860
you'll be able to see them.

76
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,320
And I think everybody should experience a Dempagumi concert
at least once in their life.

77
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,520
It's so awesome.

78
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,620
Like their fans are so great.

79
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,520
There's one member, Furukawa Mi.

80
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:57,440
who has gotten, I'm not going to say infamous because it's
not that at all, but she went, she got, she went viral for

81
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,960
being a married idol and she had a kid not so long ago.

82
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,640
Well, I don't know, a couple, maybe a couple of years, two
years ago, which is still, that's still new.

83
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,200
That's still a new baby.

84
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:30,140
so yeah aura hi really love dempagumi I'm so sad to see
they're just banning me too like I have so many like if I go

85
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:40,420
into my closet half of my t-shirts are dempagumi I have like
happy coats of dempah I have I have a whole like I only own

86
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:54,420
one Ida bag and it's all dempagumi themed so but um we've
had them around for a really long time 16 years so um super

87
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:02,700
duper grateful that um and you know the sad truth of it is
that in recent years they haven't been so popular uh they

88
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:11,920
started out as a group a duo this is like going way way back
but they started out as like um as just uh a duo and then

89
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:20,340
they added more people into be a five-member group which is
what a lot of people kind of I wouldn't say like the star

90
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:29,080
but like the beginning of the star of like the big DEMPA era
then one of the members left her name was Miu and they added

91
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:41,360
two other members Pinkie and Moga and they became a group of
six and from there like that was that was like the group

92
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:50,820
that a lot of people really like consider the golden era of
dempogumi even though i love all of dempogumi Mizutama

93
00:10:50,820 --> 00:11:04,840
online ogs yes they weren't even named dempogumi at the time
um and they were created by um mofukchan who um works at

94
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,880
dear stage which i don't know if anybody

95
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,660
She actually works as one of the JP staff in V Shoujo.

96
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,660
So, I remember when V Shoujo announced that, I was like...

97
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
I was like...

98
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,020
Mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-movuk-chan?

99
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,480
I was like, no way!

100
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,360
So, yeah!

101
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,600
It's super...

102
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,760
I...

103
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,660
It was like, I was like, no way.

104
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,380
This is... there's no way.

105
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,460
So I was super duper shocked about that.

106
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,340
So now, yeah, so, so, so, so, so, so.

107
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,020
So, she technically works for V-Shojo.

108
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,380
Well, the world is so big and so small at the same time.

109
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,160
I know, right?

110
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,360
It was like the last thing I remember.

111
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:05,840
I remember messaging a few of my friends who, they're not
like super into idol, or not idols.

112
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:12,120
They're not super into V-Tubers, but they know Dempa and
Deer Stage, They were just like, what?

113
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,680
What is this crossover?

114
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:24,120
But, um, and, uh, so, um, uh, what was it?

115
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,360
Um, and that's not like secret news or anything.

116
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,320
They announced that.

117
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,100
But nobody, I think people didn't really know who she was.

118
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,920
So it kind of was like a, oh, some, some lady joined Bishojo
Japan.

119
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:50,600
yeah yeah yeah and so um yeah there was the golden era that
you have like the six of them they have songs that like one

120
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:58,600
thing that here let me finish by that they have songs about
like you know being the six of them things like that and um

121
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:06,660
one thing that like really makes them stand out from other
idols is that they they're all like otaku girls they're all

122
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:17,900
like you know um it's so cute meeting made a post um she's
like considered the leader she made a post um uh recently

123
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:26,360
you know because of all of this just being like i became an
idol to to like get back at the people that said that i

124
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,220
couldn't do it all the bullies because she like she dropped
out of high school and everything like she um and you know

125
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:40,840
there was like it's just a it's like a kind of group of
girls that you wouldn't expect to be idols who all um who

126
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:52,800
all just became shining stars and they're so sweet and so so
great and i love all of them so yeah um so they're super

127
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:04,520
duper awesome i only bought my my um what's the word my joy
sound pass for for what for the three hours and denpagumi

128
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:13,900

130
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,200

131
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,840
My precious group.

132
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,680
My favorite group ever.

133
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:46,700
Um.

134
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,680
So.

135
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,860
Let's see.

136
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,260
Where's my...

137
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,700
Oh, there we go.

138
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,380
Den.

139
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,260
I think I'm going to have to type in the group name every
time.

140
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,100
Which kind of sucks because it's going to take me a second.

141
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,580
Denpa.

142
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,440
Gumi Inc.

143
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,520
Denpa.

144
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:19,340
I'm gonna start with a warm-up song Oh my gosh They have so
On Joy Sound here They have 102 songs So honestly I could

145
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:28,880
sing I think It feels like almost their whole discography
They have so many And I'll be honest I'm probably going to

146
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:44,800
sing more of the older songs Because It's what I know best
by older i mean like i don't know i don't know actually what

147
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,760
considered is considered older anymore um future diver i
don't know if that's a warm-up song and i also apologize

148
00:15:51,760 --> 00:16:02,080
again about my voice because um i i this like i said karaoke
might be a mistake but whatever i want to sing tempagumi

149
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,620
I'm here so freaking cute.

150
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,420
I can't deal.

151
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,560
What do you mean?

152
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,740
Um, a lot of their songs are very like high energy.

153
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,180
There's like a whole genre called Dempah Music, which like
is very high energy, like fun.

154
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,640
I don't even like I'm bad at describing things, but they're
very high energy.

155
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,460
Akiba pop.

156
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,180
They have lots of songs about Akiba.

157
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,720
They love Akiba too, so Yeah!

158
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,620
Okay.

159
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,280
I'm gonna sing this one, which is actually one of their more
serious songs, but I'm gonna sing it to kind of warm up my

160
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,520
throat a little bit.

161
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:57,800
I was just recording with Matara doing an episode for the
podcast.

162
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,740
And we talked for, of course, longer than we expected to,
so...

163
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,260
Yeah, actually, no, I'm going to save this one for later
because I will cry.

164
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,620
Okay, this one is called Brand New World.

165
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,200
It is a bit more of a serious song, but they have some
pretty cool songs.

166
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,760
Actually, no, you know what?

167
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,980
I'm going to do Phantom of the Truth.

168
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,800
Because it is also, it's a really cool song.

169
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:32,440
They did a collab with a game called Phantom of the Kill,
which I, or no, Phantom of Kill.

170
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,860
Anyway, they were featured as characters in the game, and
this is the song from that, and it's really cool, and I

171
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,760
think it might be better just try singing it than the other
one.

172
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,480
Okay, you know what?

173
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:51,120
I only have three hours that might pass, and I started it at
six, so I already wasted 20 minutes, you guys.

174
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,300
Let me know if the audio is okay.

175
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:23,230
the phantom of my heart I just killed the phantom of myself
I'm I'm I'm the only one I just killed the phantom of myself

176
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:49,200
I'm the only one Why can't I eat a lot of this world's
already been

177
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,980
Oh my gosh, the timing is a little up.

178
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:01,780
Oh my gosh, the timing is a little up.

179
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,180
It's a little dark, but it's still white.

180
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:17,540
The warmth and the love and the love are hidden.

181
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:48,660
I just killed the phantom of my heart I just killed the
phantom of myself I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm the only one Oh

182
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:21,460
Yeah, warm-up Yeah, warm-up

183
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:34,700
Go out of control now Cutting out of control now

184
00:20:48,760 --> 00:21:22,360
Oh I can't wait to get what I'm looking for No, no, no, it's
not No, no, no, no, it's not No, I'm trying to get back to

185
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:33,220
you Now I'm in my heart, I'm saying the truth And the truth
is more, more The heart's stronger, more I'm feeling better,

186
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:40,640
I'm feeling more, it's healing, and still, I'm going to be
moving I'm going to move again,

187
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:17,860
Yeah, that was Phantom of the Kill, which is such a cool
song and I'm just murdered it, but that's okay.

188
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,430
Phantom of the...

189
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,420
The...

190
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,020
The...

191
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,860
Oh, no, truth.

192
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,600
Sorry, I was mixing up truth.

193
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,700
Phantom of the truth.

194
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,520
Oh, it just totally went off.

195
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,080
Hold on.

196
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,800
There we go.

197
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,240
Yeah.

198
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,960
Yeah, warming up.

199
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:48,580
I'm going to, I think I put it in the pin message, but in
case you're watching this later, I'm not going to do well on

200
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,240
a lot of these songs.

201
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,160
Because a lot of them are made for six people.

202
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:09,420
And also um uh their range is like they can go from like
very cool voices to very like cutesy and like and um it

203
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:16,160
doesn't it might not suit my voice entirely but we're just
here to have fun so hopefully you like the songs and you

204
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:26,360
just check them out yourself because um they have some they
have such an incredible um oh sorry hold on i'm typing at

205
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,080
the same time they have an incredible

206
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,300
discography.

207
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,140
They have so many different types of music.

208
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,460
Starting off good.

209
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,360
Time to clone yourself.

210
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,300
This next song, I know I can sing, but it also makes me cry.

211
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,920
So my performance is about passion, not studio recording
precision.

212
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,760
Passion, passion.

213
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,680
Yeah.

214
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,120

This song has me blushing.

230
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:07,990
This song has me blushing.

231
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:14,270
I never thought I was thinking about it.

232
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:27,610
The kiyun-kiyun of time-gire of love I've just been
repeating, but today you're somewhere different.

233
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,310
The end of time-gire of love

234
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:38,820
That was the One of my favorite songs.

235
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,960
Actually ever probably.

236
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,260
Let's see.

237
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,060
It's like kind of weird.

238
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,300
It's like kind of weird.

239
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,500
Like that.

240
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,460
That was so cute.

241
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,900
I didn't know it was a Dempogumi song.

242
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,740
Yeah!

243
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,160
So I, so, let me see, if I click this and, well, let me
search Dempokumi.

244
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,120
Oh, I can put them under my favorite artist.

245
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,900
Oh, I can put them under my favorite art.

246
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,440
Wait, how do I search by favorite artist, though?

247
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,500
Is there like, oh, wait.

248
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,360
This is ranking.

249
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,560
Sorry, I'm using Joyce.

250
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,500
Oh, wait, maybe here.

251
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,660
Maybe under my name.

252
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,120
I can put them under my favorite, but I can't search it.

253
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:41,880
Hmm.

254
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,980
It's kind of weird.

255
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,520
Even when they're gone, they're still the ones you love.

256
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,000
So true.

257
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,580
Wait, top, top it.

258
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,280
No, not.

259
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,940
Oh, wait.

260
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,100
My room may be under here.

261
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,460
Oh, yes.

262
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,300
Okay, perfect.

263
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,120
Now I don't have to type them in every time.

264
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,460
I'm using tilt control.

265
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:15,920
Oh my gosh, I don't know what else is There's so many songs
Oh, I'm just gonna go through And a lot of these Oh, that I

266
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:26,620
feel like I can sing Better than other Ones, I think I'll
just Cry the whole time They have so many Good, like, feel

267
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,140
good songs Actually, maybe I'll do this one

268
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,260
Um, hold on

269
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:51,390
I'm not like a lot of these I've never sung before so it's I
kind of always stick to the same ones but that's okay wait

270
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:57,230
what's actually no I can't sing some of these because I'll
just cry okay let's get through some of these without crying

271
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:12,590
orange rium that's one of them I'll just cry oh just cry WWE
best this one though I tried actually I sang this one At

272
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,450
karaoke, I tried singing it.

273
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:22,250
Last time I was in Japan, like, I don't know if you guys
noticed, but in the lyrics of Kuchikibo, which is the short

274
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:26,810
name of Kuchituke Kibonu, they talk about, like, they sing
about being in Akiba and everything.

275
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,870
And this one, this song is also about Akiba.

276
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,810
But I think if I sing it, I...

277
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,290
Okay, we gotta try it.

278
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,010
We just gotta get through this.

279
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,670
No, I'm gonna save it for...

280
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,270
I can't, I can't, I can't.

281
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,710
I'm already tearing up.

282
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,010
I can already feel myself tearing up.

283
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,270
Hmm.

284
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,270
Do they have a WWD?

285
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,710
I feel like they should, right?

286
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:52,250
Oh, they do.

287
00:32:53,370 --> 00:33:02,250
So they have two songs, WWD, WWD2, and then WWD Best, which
is the first one.

288
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,170
WWD is kind of like about how the girls met.

289
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:13,830
It's about how the lyrics are like, we're starting from this
small stage, but when we're one day we'll reach the world.

290
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,770
Oh, I forgot to do the intro.

291
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,210
Oh my gosh, I went to do this when I first started the
stream.

292
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:36,410
So this is their like little catchphrase that they say that
means basically spreading, we're Dempagumi, we're spreading

293
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,590
Moe Kiyun songs all over the world.

294
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:47,470
like this little thing with their hands and then they make
their they make like an L shape with their hands and then

295
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:58,910
they um put it above their heads um yeah sorry i guess maybe
i should show you guys what songs i'm looking at right no

296
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:09,190
maybe it's better to um keep it secret i don't know but yeah
wwd is about like how they were how they came to be wwd2 is

297
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:17,610
like a little more dramatic It's about how each girl kind of
doubts themselves, but together as Dempakumi, they are so

298
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,670
powerful and great.

299
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:24,590
And then WWD Best was the last version of the song.

300
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:31,950
And that was right before the member, Moga, she left from
the 6 that I talked about earlier.

301
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,870
Cryingwugfan.com.

302
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,630
Yeah.

303
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:52,630
And so, you know, after Moga left, because, you know, you
have WWD, you have WWD too, in the songs they like mention

304
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,590
each other's names.

305
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,850
After Moga left, like they kind of weren't really able to
perform these songs anymore.

306
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:05,910
They eventually did get two other members, Nemoto Nagi, who
is also a member of another idol group I really like called

307
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,910
Nijino Conquistador.

308
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:18,530
and um Perorin um she was um an artist she's an artist uh
she does a lot of like um idol otaku art and stuff like that

309
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:28,630
and um not botchinatsu is my fave Nemo is so cute I know oh
my gosh I love the I love the remixes of it I listen to them

310
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:37,870
um quite often they're fun um but yeah so they added them
after that the group or after um They were added.

311
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,530
They were a group of, what's, seven.

312
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,390
Seven people for a while.

313
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,730
Then Mike Kamioshi, Yumen Minamu, she announced graduation.

314
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,810
And then not so long after that, another member, Aitaso.

315
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,650
Narusei Amy.

316
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,130
Her nickname is Aitaso.

317
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,850
She announced graduation.

318
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,890
You might recognize her because she actually voiced a...

319
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:17,750
a pre-cure which was one of her dreams and it came true i'm
so happy for her um but uh after that um they added a bunch

320
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:29,770
of new people um uh and um the group kind of became a little
bit more turbulent um with more and more members leaving um

321
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:43,050
uh so it's understandable that um that you know ending
especially with some of the core members also uh also you

322
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:54,750
know getting older and starting families even so but they've
always been so awesome i'm gonna try singing wwd too but

323
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:02,690
you're going to quickly realize why this song is very
difficult to sing especially as one person and it also has

324
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:07,790
different languages in it so um if i get them wrong Sorry.

325
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:08,870

I can't do high notes at all right now.

445
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:19,830
I probably, like I said, I know I keep repeating myself.

455
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:43,990
Where's the opening?

456
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:49,010
It would help if I took these fans out of my hand, but I'm
also...

457
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:51,990
A ghost.

458

WWD best right now.

464
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,100
I don't know if I can do it.

465
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,620
A lot of these songs will just make me cry.

466
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:24,360
Um...

467
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,880

468
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,220
Oh, thank you!

469
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,400

checking them out.

00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,760
Thanks for sharing your passions with us.

471
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:33,680

00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:38,720
Sorry that I only shared them to this extent once they're
leaving.

473
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,420
But we still have a year with them.

474
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,620

I want to see the light.

519
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:47,900
A strong feeling, a strong love, a heart, a heart, a heart
that a heart can connect.

I'm also happy.

536
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:58,850
Precious Summer kills me so much.

537
01:01:59,070 --> 01:01:59,830
Me too!

538
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:02,110

539
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:05,030
Precious Summer.

540
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,110
Oh, this is our last summer with Dempo.

541
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:13,070
Oh gosh, I can't.

542
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,390
I can't think about it too much.

543
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,190
I just have to think about me having a vista.

544
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:21,730
I just have to think about me.

545
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:27,430
Just thinking about this as a normal karaoke stream.

546
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:30,530
Okay, Future Diver.

547
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,110
This is like probably, I would say, their most popular song.

548
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:38,590
The calls in it are so much fun.

549
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:49,270
I recommend 100% looking up a video of them performing it so
you could see just how much fun the whole thing is.

550
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:52,070
It's so awesome.

551
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:56,470
Yeah.

552
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:04,590
But this song is also very hard, so I'm not going to sing it
well.

553
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:05,550
Just a warning.

554
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:12,130
Let's go!

555
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:16,880

bit more, I don't like the galaxy, I don't like anything 24

559
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,020

01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:55,480
So I completely forgot.

621
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:06,780
During like the beginning parts, when it's like, The calls
you do are just like...

622
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:10,620
You say the member's name, so it's like...

623
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,740
Miri no mabushi ni hayo!

624
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,100
I actually, I'll be honest, I don't know the calls for the
new girls.

625
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,340
Because I don't know, um...

626
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,240
I don't know who sings which part anymore.

627
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,000
I just remember the original.

628
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,500
I like how many switch ups they have in their songs.

629
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:36,900
It's fun.

01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:43,980

energy is unmatched.

Okay.

668
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:16,150
Okay, that was, uh...

669
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:17,370
One second, okay.

670
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:20,810
use.

671
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:38,890
Did she sing Sakura Operation already?

672
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:41,710
I have not, because it's not on the set list yet.

673
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:45,950
But rather, it's not written, so I have not sung it yet.

674
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:47,650
Welcome though, welcome.

675
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:51,590
Oh, song made me so happy.

676
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:53,390
It's such a sweet song.

677
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:55,010
It's so cute.

678
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:57,230
Like I said, I can't sing a lot of their songs.

679
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:16,000
well because i mostly just listen to them but um but yeah
they have such cute songs and fun songs and oh do i oh i'm

680
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:23,820
gonna try singing this one it's kind of another they have a
bunch of like really fun songs like i won't be singing

681
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:29,780
because it's so fast and maybe I could do...

682
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:31,420
Sabotage!

683
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:34,720
Notoboty.

684
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:41,080
Minto being a part of the idol group too, they just don't
know it yet.

685
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:44,180
I...

686
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:49,490
Um...

687
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:50,610
Uh...

688
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:53,850
It's funny because like...

689
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:59,270
I mean, if you had asked me years ago if I wanted to be an
idol, I think...

690
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:00,210
No, not I think.

691
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:00,450
I know.

692
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:12,030
no 100 i would have been like yes yes i want to be an idol i
want to be an idol but i don't know so much now i almost

693
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:24,550
wanted to say if you wanted to die try true duty but lol um
i don't know so much now if i want to be an idol um i think

694
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:42,270
that one thing i um one thing that you know there's one one
obviously hold on let me gather my words when you are a fan

695
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:51,770
of something it can be natural to also want to be a part of
that thing you know like you know if you want to if you're a

696
01:17:51,770 --> 01:18:11,550
fan of idols you want to be an idol but to me I think um I
think I think you should honestly if you have those feelings

697
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:27,390
as well you should you should cherish the feeling of being a
fan more because you know say you say you join say you

698
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:42,470
become what you like and be say that what you love is not
what you expected and you know what you the thing you know

699
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:51,410
maybe things are not as good as you thought it would be
maybe you join an idol group and you're just like oh I loved

700
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:59,930
I loved seeing my favorite idols being so cute together on
stage I bet they're the bestest of friends and then you join

701
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:07,970
and maybe they they don't like each other maybe they don't
talk maybe it's just the complete opposite of what you

702
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:22,010
imagined maybe maybe the manager is like a poopy guy maybe
um just you know once you learn the ins of something it's

703
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:34,710
you know if you if you you know it's much harder to uh go
back to being a fan and you'll never have that opportunity

704
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:42,630
again I'm not usually one to say don't meet your heroes
because every time I've met my hero I've I've you know been

705
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:51,510
very happy but but you'll never have that opportunity you'll
never have that love again if the thing that you loved once

706
01:19:52,310 --> 01:20:02,570
you know turns into resentment you can never you can never
take that back so please cherish being a fan if you can you

707
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:08,510
know so that's all i wanted to say about that

708
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:25,660
let's see um oh i was gonna do this one before but i can do
it now actually i was gonna say I was going to do a couple

709
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:33,720
other songs from that album but like there were some songs
that like from Dempa that really like when I was so down

710
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:42,420
they really saved me so I I don't think I can sing them at
all though because I definitely will cry what is this a hit

711
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:48,200
song medley like this is one of them this is one of the
songs and this one Kibo note

712
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:53,980
Let's see.

713
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,440
But we can do brand new world.

714
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:57,960
This one's a little bit more serious, so.

715
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,060
A little cooler.

716
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:05,640
More simply, I feel like people don't need to turn their
hobbies into a career.

717
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:08,120
Sometimes having the hobby to yourself is more satisfying.

718
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:08,980
Yeah, of course.

719
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,400
I mean, there's always the what-ifs, but...

720
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:15,660
I mean, what if you...

721
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:18,120
What if it ruins the whole experience for you?

722
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,860
That's the part that scares me the most.

723
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,540
I feel like I'm playing groove coaster with this background.

724
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:49,800
Hey, tell me, tell me.

725
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:55,440
Just, it's just a little bit.

726
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,120
What kind of a future?

727
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:58,760
What was it?

728
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,280
I was there.

729
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:14,060
The dream of a dream, the love-gaki is definitely here here.

730
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:24,820
That's how I feel, I'm not able to get back to my days, my
heart's spiral is falling down.

731
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:33,140
There's no way no more, we're going to get out of the light
for the light of light.

732
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:50,740
The sky is always always continuing, so the tears will come
to the world If you say goodbye to the world, if you're

733
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:59,180
afraid, then you'll be more How can I be more strong?

734
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:15,880
I've always been looking at it Just in a way What did I
make?

735
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,580
What did I make?

736
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:30,960
If you keep looking at it, even if you don't even realize
it, you'll be in the same place.

737
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:37,300
So I'm scared, scared, scared, scared, scared, scared.

738
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:42,000
My heart goes to lose my heart.

739
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,920
In the time of time, we're going to see the future.

740
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:52,960
I'm going to look for the future.

741
01:23:53,580 --> 01:24:04,980
It's always, it's not going to be so The tears are full of
tears And I'm feeling like a lot of days When you say a good

742
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:16,920
day, if I say goodbye to you The tears are so much I forget
about it all And

743
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:40,440
it's hard to feel like It's so hard to find out I'm going to
let it go Rally, yamazu, Hibiku, Uta'goye Was Kino to myself

744
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:59,960
To reclaim The sky is I'm sure Haredi wadar So I'm gonna cry
Hurrying Kino, Sayonara I'm afraid I'm gonna The sky will

745
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:04,220
like a white tree like

746
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:22,840
promise myself promise yourself all brand new

747
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:33,520
promise myself promise yourself

748
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:49,180
Yay!

749
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,440
That was brand new world.

750
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:55,620
How much time?

751
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:56,580
Okay, wait.

752
01:25:57,540 --> 01:26:00,250
What's left?

753
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:01,090
No!

754
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:02,470
Wait.

755
01:26:04,330 --> 01:26:06,090
I think I talked for two...

756
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:06,990
I only have a... Wait.

757
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:08,550
I have only a half hour!

758
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:10,270
But I... Wait.

759
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:12,790
Six, seven, eight...

01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,560
An hour and a half.

761
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,520
Oh!

762
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,360
It was... My brain kept thinking two hours.

763
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:22,100
Oh my gosh, you're right.

I will try Sakura Apparation.

773
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:44,720
The music video for this one is maybe my favorite DEMPA
music video.

774
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,420
It's so, the way that it's made is so cute.

775
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,640
It's so fun.

776
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:51,200
It's just, it's so creative.

777
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:51,760
I love it.

778
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,120

01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:12,000

They are like singing over each other in the song.

786
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,360
It's so fast.

787
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:38,520
书亦亦亦亦亦亦亦亦亦亦亦亦互亦亦亦亦亦

788
01:30:42,420 --> 01:31:17,550

have like Sakura petals coming from the stage and

789
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:18,090
everything.

790
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:25,850
Tinton tension, to where to go, all the powerful, send kai,
they'll skimuakaro.

791
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:33,670
Achi, mo, gochido, a showy, a pate, a pate, a pate, a pate,

793
01:31:57,310 --> 01:32:00,410
In the month of the summer, we'll dance together.

794
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:02,350
The sakurama, it's a good season.

795
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:04,030
Let's sing it.

796
01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:05,990
We'll sing it together.

797
01:32:07,410 --> 01:32:09,850
Until the day we'll see you again.

798
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:11,990
So don't forget to sing.

799
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:13,590
Don't forget to sing.

800
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:14,850
Don't forget to.

801
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:17,710
Bye bye.

802
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:20,470
Bye bye.

803
01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:47,690
I'm surprised my throat can reach that note right now.

804
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:49,290
Oh, what's wrong?

805
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:51,610
There we go.

806
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:52,570
Bye-bye.

807
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,630
Maybe I should have said that for last, right?

808
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:56,310
Bye-bye.

809
01:32:56,830 --> 01:32:57,350
Sayonara.

810
01:32:57,550 --> 01:33:00,190
Sakura Appellation.

811
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:03,070
Definitely check out the music video for that one.

812
01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:04,530
It's such a...

813
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:06,390
Their songs are just so fun!

814
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:09,510
Like, their shows are just a whole big party.

815
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:10,510
It's so great.

816
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:13,430
They're the bestest girls ever.

817
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:21,090
I do wonder how would be like.

818
01:33:21,950 --> 01:33:23,370
Also, this one's really great, too.

819
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:24,970
I've never sung it.

820
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:26,710
A lot of these, like I said, I've never sung before.

821
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:29,810
But...

822
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:32,950
I think they played that at their last show ever.

823
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:33,790
I think they will.

824
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:36,290
It's one of their really popular songs.

825
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:38,170
So what album do you recommend?

826
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:46,830
They have like a WWE best album Which has a lot of their
popular It doesn't have anything of their newest stuff But

827
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:50,510
it does have like their older classic stuff Have you seen
them live often?

828
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:51,430
Not often.

829
01:33:51,890 --> 01:34:07,610
I've seen them I can count how many times I've seen them
live on one hand probably Um Uh There I Um When I like them

830
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:19,850
at my peak I couldn't afford to go see them very often so
and even still it sometimes can be difficult to see them

831
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:26,130
because of because sometimes like I can't get not that that
chick like that not the tickets selling out but it's like

832
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:33,690
hard to get them as like a foreigner you know what app is
you're using is on switch yes it's on the switch it's called

833
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:38,010
the joy sound app you have to you have Japanese account to
get it though.

834
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:41,150
What's the other one?

835
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:45,510
Not not oh yes me what's the other one?

836
01:34:46,690 --> 01:34:46,890
Oh

837
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:53,790
maybe they don't have it.

838
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:58,410
This one would make me cry.

839
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:00,690
I wonder how the medley is like.

840
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:06,270
I love I love I love all their songs.

841
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:07,930
There's like not a song that I...

842
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:09,310
Oh, Akihaba Live!

843
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:17,330
This one is really fun because like the music video is in
Akiba.

844
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:24,910
I have to do WWD best at some point.

845
01:35:25,530 --> 01:35:27,150
Actually, this one is also Akiba song.

846
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:28,830
Actually, this one is like a really slow song.

847
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:30,490
It's probably the slowest song they have.

848
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:33,750
But it's really pretty.

849
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:35,090
In fact, I will sing it.

850
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:38,370
I will sing it.

851
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,580
The only release bangers.

852
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,620
And they do, they do.

853
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:48,840
I'll sing sabotage, don't worry.

854
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,380
You don't have to pay me anything.

855
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:52,680
In

856
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:20,340
the autumn flowering flowering with you, When you met with
me, the season was the four-tune, the dream even and it

857
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:22,720
rinsing.

858
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:46,700
In the nightly snowy-cold and wavisicically curate the tears
now, now, the heart The world is going to flow.

859
01:36:50,400 --> 01:37:02,300
I know when the end comes, I will be at that place.

860
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:04,920
At the end,

861
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:11,700
I will make a promise.

862
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:13,960
Sorry.

863
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:11,080
I'm sure Now I'm more Yes, I'm here Oh, I'm here

864
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:19,140

865
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:34,800
I'm here But I'm here, I'm here This world I love I know I'm
going to shine

866
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:50,900
Thank you I'll see you tomorrow And

867
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:54,120
Oh my gosh.

868
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:55,640
Sorry guys.

869
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:03,240
Maybe it's too early to sing that one.

870
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:04,640
Aki...

871
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:06,100
Aki no...

872
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:07,060
Wait.

873
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:10,180
Aki no...

874
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:11,020

01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,520
Bade.

876
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:14,480
It's kind of a...

877
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:14,960
Isn't it?

878
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:15,980
Is it... Do you have the day?

879
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:16,480
I'm not sure.

880
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:21,000
Oh, ah!

881
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:21,740
Wait, let me...

882
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:22,780
Let me double check it.

883
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:24,760
Aki no ha...

884
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,760

Passion.

888
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,080
This one is also one that I'm going to mess up a lot.

889
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:07,920
But that's okay.

890
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:09,940
Actually, maybe I can get...

891
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:17,380
Maybe I can get like a Romaji for this one.

892
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:19,840
Because I don't know otherwise if I'll be able to sing it.

893
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:25,160
Uh...

894
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:34,650
My reading comprehension.

895
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:37,710
Okay.

896
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:42,070
This song is also a super duper popular song.

897
01:41:42,610 --> 01:41:44,890
When they do the dance for this, they use ribbons.

898
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:46,570
And it's so fun!

899
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:48,870
They like are spinning the ribbons all around.

900
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:50,570
They even do Otage with the ribbons.

901
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:52,190
And it's so much fun!

902
01:41:52,470 --> 01:41:53,570
I actually know it.

903
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:56,250
I learned this dance.

904
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:58,890
Maybe one day I can show you guys if I ever have a 3D model.

905
01:42:00,710 --> 01:42:00,850
Hmm.

906
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:05,020
Okay.

Oh, there's Mofuka-chan!

01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:11,300

01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:16,230

the Oh, this is going to be fine.

918
01:44:32,370 --> 01:44:33,890
It's a very difficult world, but I don't know.

01:44:34,330 --> 01:44:35,170
No, no, no, no, no.

It's all right.

922
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:39,830
It's already starting.

923
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:41,070
Hey, yo!

924
01:44:41,290 --> 01:44:42,490
Tempo check one, two.

01:44:43,290 --> 01:44:45,770
This is the story of the story.

926
01:44:47,410 --> 01:44:48,510
The world starts live.

927
01:44:48,850 --> 01:44:50,390
Live the ghost.

928
01:44:50,650 --> 01:44:52,230
Aki-ba-ga-nai-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

929
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:56,190
Minus-から-no.

930
01:44:56,610 --> 01:44:57,050
Number one.

931
01:44:57,050 --> 01:45:04,610
I'll take this number day I've never had that week Please
give me your crush This big ball

01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:19,500
A boy A boy It's always The couple of the boat I'm still on

934
01:45:52,430 --> 01:46:05,540
No matter how much No matter how much tea I drink My throat
would never be prepared for that song Right now

935
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:21,080
That was like That was like Den Den Passionless Den Den,
den, passion.

936
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:22,160
Oh, gosh.

937
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:23,940
Don't listen to that one.

938
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,160
Maybe I'll un-archive this since it was so bad.

939
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,120
Holy moly.

940
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,100
I'm going to take more of this honey stuff.

941
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:41,100
You guys, I've been drinking this whole stream.

942
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:43,340
It's just that I got sick.

943
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:45,480
And it kind of messed up my throat.

944
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:48,340
And it hasn't fully recovered.

945
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:50,140
So.

946
01:46:56,790 --> 01:46:57,590
But also.

947
01:46:58,390 --> 01:46:59,210
Don't tell me what to do.

948
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:10,000
I don't need a bunch of people being like Stop streaming
Don't sing anymore I know my limits Don't worry

949
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:15,470
Don't worry

950
01:47:20,410 --> 01:47:21,110
Don't worry

951
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:39,320
Right now I'm eating honey It's like a special honey throat
thingy Also that song was just crazy You can't breathe in it

952
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,140
So I'm like trying to keep up.

953
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,180
Again, songs meant for six people.

954
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:55,830
My

955
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:03,970
throat in it, I know it sounds painful when I sing.

956
01:48:05,050 --> 01:48:06,010
But my throat doesn't hurt.

957
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:07,330
It's just like raspy.

958
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:09,290
It doesn't hurt me at all.

959
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:11,410
It just can't hit the notes.

960
01:48:12,850 --> 01:48:15,930
So it's not like I'm hurting myself or anything like that.

961
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:18,090
If you're just like, oh my God, she's killing me.

962
01:48:18,110 --> 01:48:37,710
herself no it's just it's just it just isn't hitting the
notes as well yeah let's see but i still have an hour it's

963
01:48:37,710 --> 01:48:39,370
another song that i can do that maybe

964
01:48:44,110 --> 01:48:47,770
there's the other one though hold on i'm gonna look it up

965
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:57,790
Don't forget there's the ink at the end of their name.

966
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:00,710
It's one of the song lyrics even.

967
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:05,750
They're like, there's, don't forget the ink at the end of
our name.

968
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:10,750
I wonder if I could sing, baby, baby.

969
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:13,110
No, that one part at the end of Precious Summer.

970
01:49:13,510 --> 01:49:16,030
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

971
01:49:18,610 --> 01:49:21,470
Baby, baby, oh, oh, I got it.

972
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:22,230
Honey, money.

973
01:49:22,570 --> 01:49:23,410
Oh, thank you.

974
01:49:24,490 --> 01:49:25,650
Thank you very much.

975
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:29,550
Baby, baby.

976
01:49:33,070 --> 01:49:35,790
Oh, actually, there is a song on here that I do want to
sing.

977
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:40,870
Which I think I saw towards the top.

978
01:49:40,990 --> 01:49:43,350
And I was like, oh, my God, they have this on here.

979
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:48,300
I saw it.

980
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:48,820
Hold on.

981
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,640
Wait, is this the one that I wanted?

982
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:53,260
Hold on.

983
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:55,140
I don't

984
01:49:59,190 --> 01:50:00,190
know.

985
01:50:00,330 --> 01:50:02,010
I feel like I'm losing my brain.

986
01:50:08,370 --> 01:50:09,190
Oh, it's got a summer.

987
01:50:09,470 --> 01:50:10,350
Oh, it's got a summer.

988
01:50:11,030 --> 01:50:13,970
That's another fun song because they use towels in the
dance.

989
01:50:16,670 --> 01:50:18,570
That one is also the rap part.

990
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:20,310
I was screwed up so bad.

991
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:22,250
.

992
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:30,110
Oh,

993
01:50:33,490 --> 01:50:37,850
I also, you guys may have heard Dempogumi before and didn't
even realize.

994
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:49,090
If you, if you watched Saiki-ke-ke, they did the openings,
the opening song.

995
01:50:54,010 --> 01:51:19,330
no yeah so they did those songs wait where was it oh wait no
no fancy hope wait wait I know I saw it under here though I

996
01:51:19,330 --> 01:51:21,110
think actually I think I need to search the keyword.

997
01:51:22,990 --> 01:51:23,790
Not artist.

998
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:26,410
Yes.

999
01:51:27,270 --> 01:51:29,770
Because there's even more songs under searching as a
keyword.

1000
01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:32,490
There's so many DEMPA songs.

1001
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:36,170
I mean, they've been around for 16 years, so of course
there's going to be a ton.

1002
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:38,790
I wonder if they have any of the old old ones.

1003
01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:40,670
Thank you!

1004
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:43,730
Thanks, Vogue.

1005
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:46,750
I wonder if they have any ones like Magic Mirror on here.

1006
01:51:56,710 --> 01:52:02,710
Also, one of the members, Aizawa Lisa, she is in another
group called, um,

1007
01:52:06,490 --> 01:52:08,910
oh my gosh.

1008
01:52:09,530 --> 01:52:10,130
She's in a duo.

1009
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:11,910
Someone help me, please.

1010
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:18,670
But, um, in the duo, uh, they did the, um, endings for
Lamelith.

1011
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:19,410
Yes, thank you.

1012
01:52:19,490 --> 01:52:20,090
Thank you, Thomas.

1013
01:52:21,510 --> 01:52:23,270
My brain kept saying Mia Regina.

1014
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:24,370
And I was like, that's not it.

1015
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:25,190
That's not correct.

1016
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:28,290
She's in a, yes, lavaleth.

1017
01:52:29,230 --> 01:52:31,750
They did the endings for the Aquatope anime.

1018
01:52:33,630 --> 01:52:36,130
So, Dempah is everywhere.

1019
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:37,690
Here we go.

1020
01:52:37,970 --> 01:52:44,950
So this song is not specifically a Dempah Gumi song, but it
is sung by my favorite, it's sung by my kamioshi, Yumei

1021
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:45,270
Nemu.

1022
01:52:46,590 --> 01:52:52,390
And it's actually one of the songs from her album, her
graduation album.

1023
01:52:53,110 --> 01:52:53,230
So,

1024
01:52:56,850 --> 01:52:59,010
I will try and sing it.

1025
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:00,850
I've never sung this one before either.

1026
01:53:01,110 --> 01:53:01,670
Oh my gosh.

1027
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:06,290
I hope I do it justice for my OShi.

1028
01:53:10,810 --> 01:53:15,550
I didn't get to go to her graduation, but there was a, she
did like a solo show.

1029
01:53:17,970 --> 01:53:19,790
Well, there wasn't a solo show.

1030
01:53:20,910 --> 01:53:23,390
It was like a, she did like a celebration show.

1031
01:53:23,410 --> 01:53:28,570
and I got to go see her there one more time.

1032
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:31,530
But I only got to see her twice, believe it or not.

1033
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:36,810
.

1034
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:41,290
.

1035
01:53:41,290 --> 01:53:41,350
.

1036
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:41,630
.

1037
01:53:41,630 --> 01:53:41,690
.

1038
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:41,850
.

1039
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:44,570
.

1040
01:53:44,570 --> 01:53:44,650
.

1041
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:44,750
.

1042
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:49,410
.

1043
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:55,890
This is the end of my life, I decided to go somewhere else.

1044
01:53:56,950 --> 01:54:04,010
In this room, there's no one in this room, I'm on the wall
and I'm on the wall.

1045
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:09,370
The day I'm in the morning, the day I'm in the morning.

1046
01:54:12,010 --> 01:54:16,470
There are no words, but there are no words.

1047
01:54:41,450 --> 01:54:58,310
The name of the song is called My Last Love Song Wait Wait
Cataein' Nigiri A little Naku-gaki I always remember You

1048
01:54:58,310 --> 01:55:10,530
always remember You always remember Your smile Your smile
Even though Even though Even someone else I love

1049
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:59,090
voice I loved that that this day this all you you you you
you you

1050
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:19,070
Tyler, you know I've seen it all.

1051
01:57:19,070 --> 01:57:29,430
That all you're very muchveling, it was all that all your
love for you.

1052
01:57:30,230 --> 01:57:32,330
It was a dream of dawn.

1053
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:34,050
Let's meet in the best night.

1054
01:57:35,170 --> 01:57:36,630
Bye bye.

1055
01:57:55,270 --> 01:57:56,510
Whoa.

1056
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:01,050
I didn't know how people struggle.

1057
01:58:09,890 --> 01:58:12,730
She also has a remix of a...

1058
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:17,910
Well, rather, she did the vocals for...

1059
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:19,670
You know the song, Otaru No Hikari?

1060
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:23,490
They play it at the end of events and stuff in Japan.

1061
01:58:23,990 --> 01:58:29,930
So like when, like, for example, like Comic-Cette is ending
or something like that, they'll play it like...

1062
01:58:32,770 --> 01:58:34,910
Some stores even play it when they're closing.

1063
01:58:35,410 --> 01:58:38,230
So you'll hear, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na,

1064
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:45,700
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na.

1065
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:55,160
Nemo has this really awesome version of it that actually was
remixed by one of my favorite music producers ever, Panda

1066
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:55,460
Boy.

1067
01:58:57,860 --> 01:59:00,940
So, all, like, yeah, oh, yes, yes, yes.

1068
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:03,660
I always remember it by the Japanese name, because I'm a
weeb, sorry.

1069
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:04,660
Okay.

1070
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:13,580
so um it's super they played that in arcades when i was
there i assumed it was to make you sleepy and want to leave

1071
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:24,740
yeah it's just i don't know why they play it when like
things are ending but it's like kind of it's like

1072
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:29,780
bittersweet you know you hear it and you're just like oh
that was so fun it's too bad that it has to end i don't

1073
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:35,900
think they have it on here though especially Nemo's version
because actually let me search Yuhememimim because there's a

1074
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:44,600
rap part in it and I've always wanted to try I've never been
I've never I've never been able to sing it Me Me

1075
01:59:48,120 --> 01:59:54,720
Me Ne Oh Oh I

1076
01:59:57,810 --> 02:00:07,630

Yuhemimimicknamo Today I'm gonna Na Na This is her solo

1077
02:00:07,630 --> 02:00:07,990
song.

1078
02:00:08,130 --> 02:00:10,270
They each have solo songs too, so it's fun.

1079
02:00:10,670 --> 02:00:12,130
Do they have Nia Peen on here?

1080
02:00:13,370 --> 02:00:14,890
Sorry, now I'm going down a rabbit hole.

1081
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:16,830
Nia.

1082
02:00:19,130 --> 02:00:22,690
Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep.

1083
02:00:25,730 --> 02:00:27,270
Maybe, I think it's a small...

1084
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:30,430
Nia.

1085
02:00:36,780 --> 02:00:37,140
No!

1086
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:40,780
Panda Boy did the whole Nia Peen album.

1087
02:00:40,940 --> 02:00:41,880
Nia Peen is a...

1088
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:50,660
a duo idol group they're now disbanded but it was one of the
members of Dempogumi, Pinky and another member of Dempogumi

1089
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:59,580
used to have a sister group called Moso Calibration and so
the two of them a member from Nia from Moso Calibration and

1090
02:00:59,580 --> 02:01:07,540
Pinky from Dempogumi made this little group and it's kind of
a play on words because Nia Pien, Nier Pien they were a golf

1091
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:19,900
themed group and Nier Pien is close to like the term in like
for golf so it's kind of cute and all their songs are like

1092
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:25,480
like they have one song called nice shot it's so fun all
their songs are so great because they're panda boy

1093
02:01:28,860 --> 02:01:38,460
yeah why golf i don't know i have no idea i don't know if
they play golf or anything i think it's niapin no it's not

1094
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:44,080
sorry It's...

1095
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:44,640
Here, hold on.

1096
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,360
Let me see if I can...

1097
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:47,040
Nia pin.

1098
02:01:52,120 --> 02:01:53,600
Oh my god, yeah, yeah.

1099
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:55,040
I was like, oh my gosh, wait, you're right.

1100
02:01:55,140 --> 02:01:56,080
No, that's... I read it wrong.

1101
02:01:56,160 --> 02:01:58,260
No, it's a small... It's a small...

1102
02:01:58,260 --> 02:01:59,340
Nia pin.

1103
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:05,860
Sorry to just call you wrong, but...

1104
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:08,900
Sorry to call you wrong.

1105
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:15,560
But they do have their songs on YouTube so you can listen to
them.

1106
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:19,220
Their whole album is called Nice Shot.

1107
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:22,820
And all the songs are really good.

1108
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:24,060
I love Panda Boy.

1109
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:27,180
If I could get a song by Panda Boy, I would die.

1110
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:30,320
One of my favorites.

1111
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:31,760
Probably my favorite on the album.

1112
02:02:32,380 --> 02:02:33,740
I really like Have a Nice Shot.

1113
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:34,800
I like Hazard Beat.

1114
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:36,480
Hazard has a beat.

1115
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:37,440
Hazard Beat.

1116
02:02:37,780 --> 02:02:38,140
Hazard Beat.

1117
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:39,360
Hazard has a beat.

1118
02:02:39,980 --> 02:02:40,340
So good.

1119
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:41,760
Here.

1120
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:43,900
Let me show you the picture of them.

1121
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:44,960
They're so cute!

1122
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:46,400
Oh gosh, they're so cute.

1123
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:48,620
Then I have to screenshot it though.

1124
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:50,800
This is the album cover.

1125
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:52,460
I got to go see them.

1126
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:55,100
This group specifically, I got to go see them live.

1127
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:00,880
So, I have a checky with Pinky.

1128

02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:10,700
The one on the left is...

1130
02:03:10,700 --> 02:03:11,580
Well, okay, hold on.

1131
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:12,620
Wait, this is confusing.

1132
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:21,980
At the top, the one on the left, on the left is pinky and
the one on the right is nia and then and then uh um in the

1133

right is pinky yeah they're so cute they're so cute so even

1140
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:28,160
I don't think they have it on here.

1141
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:30,960
I think I would have seen it if they had it.

1142
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:32,260
Unfortunately, they don't.

1143
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:33,500
I know it doesn't seem it.

1144
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:35,780
It seemed like they have it.

1145
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:37,720
Ooh, I don't know.

1146
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:39,140
Oh, someone asked for sabotage.

1147
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:39,480
You know what?

1148
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:40,220
I can do that one.

1149
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:43,560
So this is actually a cover.

1150
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:46,100
This, okay, this is kind of bad.

1151
02:04:46,300 --> 02:04:48,240
This is the only...

1152
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:49,660
Like, this is, I don't...

1153
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:52,400
Okay, this is a cover of Sabotage by the Beastie Boys.

1154
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:57,720
But I don't really know the...

1155
02:04:57,720 --> 02:04:59,140
I know this better than the original.

1156
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:02,500
This might kill my throat.

1157
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:03,180
Oh gosh.

1158
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:04,440
I mean, my throat's already dead.

1159
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:07,180
Maybe I should have saved it for last.

1160
02:05:15,860 --> 02:05:23,160
A daso Moga Pinky Something Who did I miss?

1161

what they say here.

1169
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:45,440

Beastie Boys!

02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:39,380
I see Dempagumi, I think about Dempagumi every day.

1190
02:11:40,820 --> 02:11:44,440
Yeah, so they're super duper important to me.

1191
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:45,560
I don't know.

1192
02:11:46,680 --> 02:11:50,560
Hopefully, hopefully, hopefully I'm conveying their
strength.

1193
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,560
Thank you for singing my favorite Beastie Boy song of God.

1194
02:11:55,680 --> 02:12:02,360
always actually wanted to sing that before so i'm really
excited i'm really happy um hope but yeah hopefully i'm

1195
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:10,520
conveying how awesome they are it's hard to say without like
just witnessing their power but they're truly probably the

1196
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:20,080
best idols in the world i believe um let's see going back to
this

1197
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:31,920
You had me at Otaku Girls.

1198
02:12:33,400 --> 02:12:35,080
They're so goofy.

1199
02:12:35,460 --> 02:12:38,600
They're just such a great group of people.

1200
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:44,020
And honestly, like, just the everyone at Deer Stage 2.

1201
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:55,320
Because, you know, it's a lot of idol groups would probably
not have someone get married and have a baby and still let

1202
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:55,660
them perform.

1203
02:12:55,680 --> 02:13:04,320
form you know and um at least you know i don't know a lot
about the inside of dear stage but i would like to believe

1204
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:13,700
that they treat the idols there very well i would think so
this has been awesome you bring a lot of joy thank you thank

1205
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:19,080
you so much um which one's this one again

1206
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:34,730
is that the no that's uh no that's uh There is Notobochi

1207
02:13:39,220 --> 02:13:46,560
I don't think I'm ready for orange ream Actually maybe I am
since I just sang that And it was so goofy and funny There's

1208
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:53,500
Otsukare sama I don't think I can sing Otsukare sama
musakashisuke nookinu It's so difficult This song is awesome

1209
02:13:53,500 --> 02:14:02,920
Actually The artist for Yasumi Poonpun Did the art for this
song Ashtar Chikyu got conagona It's a very popular song

1210
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:06,280
that like a lot of idols in different groups will cover.

1211
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:07,560
So I'll sing it also.

1212
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:12,380
It's kind of fast, but I'll do my best.

1213
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:13,540
Asano?

1214
02:14:13,660 --> 02:14:14,460
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1215
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:15,240
Yes, yes.

1216
02:14:25,030 --> 02:14:27,450
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

1217
02:16:33,140 --> 02:16:46,200
I'm sure Ashtar The Earth's Earth Guna Guna Guna And it's
like The Aurora Like a make Make it And it's like It's like

1218
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:59,360
I'm gonna die I'm gonna get Guna Guna Guna There's nothing
But there's also There's still You're not gonna I'm gonna

1219
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:00,060
Why are you doing it?

1220
02:17:00,460 --> 02:17:01,620
I'm doing it.

1221
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:05,860
I'm sorry, I'm still crying.

1222
02:17:06,980 --> 02:17:14,980
Is it the way the way the stars are the way to go.

1223
02:17:33,190 --> 02:17:38,680
You're the way the world ends.

1224
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:40,920
The world ends.

1225
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:42,260
I'll be the same.

1226
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:42,840
I'll be the stage,

1227
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:47,120
I'll show you.

1228
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:55,680
360 degrees, noose, honing, and with a heurated, with two
centimeters in front of me, I'll be sure.

1229
02:17:57,900 --> 02:18:02,980
I'm a promise, a promise, I'm a promise, I'm a,

1230
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:42,640
A song is basically like what if it's like the last day on
earth what if the earth like basically like ceases like uh

1231
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:46,980
what's the word um um Like, breaks into pieces.

1232
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:55,400
My favorite part of the line, or favorite part of the lyrics
is just like, I'll just say that sucks and die.

1233
02:19:05,060 --> 02:19:07,800
The lyrics just get longer and longer and longer.

1234
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:11,360
Or the titles rather.

1235
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:14,160
Relatable, right?

1236
02:19:17,220 --> 02:19:18,160
Ah, so.

1237
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:20,160
Yeah.

1238
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:24,400
It's a, it's not a happy song.

1239
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:26,460
It's kind of, it's kind of sad, but it's really pretty.

1240
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:28,000
Wow, thank you!

1241
02:19:28,720 --> 02:19:29,740
Kind of weird, in a good way.

1242
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,100
Watching my kamiyoshi that I've watched graduate twice.

1243
02:19:33,600 --> 02:19:34,040
Twice?

1244
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:38,560
Watch your kamiyoshi graduate.

1245
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:42,100
Glad we could be here to share the love and remember the
good times.

1246
02:19:44,060 --> 02:19:44,340
Um.

1247
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:46,780
Um.

1248
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:54,520
Well, my Kamiyoshi already graduated, but it is my Kamiyoshi
group, so you're not entirely, you're not wrong, you're not

1249
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:55,080
wrong.

1250
02:19:58,460 --> 02:19:59,300
Are you a time traveler?

1251
02:19:59,740 --> 02:20:02,080
Do you see me graduate in the future again?

1252
02:20:03,780 --> 02:20:05,140
He watched the VOD twice.

1253
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:06,330
Oh, got it, got it.

1254
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:13,720
Yes, I think I, Mint Phantom, have only graduated once.

1255
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:18,240
Yeah.

1256
02:20:24,820 --> 02:20:25,880
El Saikongru.

1257
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:30,060
He re-zeroed.

1258
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:47,800
We change in the future.

1259
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:52,260
Assistant.

1260
02:20:56,330 --> 02:20:57,310
Oh, yes.

1261
02:20:57,430 --> 02:21:01,250
Okay, this is the song I did want to sing, but it's really
fast.

1262
02:21:01,330 --> 02:21:01,830
I just remember.

1263
02:21:15,090 --> 02:21:17,830
It's really, really fast, so I'm not gonna try it.

1264
02:21:18,990 --> 02:21:20,630
I've already made a fool of myself.

1265
02:21:22,570 --> 02:21:24,070
I am curious about the medley though.

1266
02:21:24,410 --> 02:21:25,390
I think I'll try the medley.

1267
02:21:26,850 --> 02:21:28,730
Let's see what songs they include.

1268
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:30,110
Oh, I have 40 minutes.

1269
02:21:31,330 --> 02:21:31,810
Where'd the medley?

1270
02:21:31,830 --> 02:21:47,590

so awesome there's even a song called welcome to deer stage

1271
02:21:47,590 --> 02:21:53,570

like they have one of the members like put on uh some

1272
02:21:53,570 --> 02:22:01,370
glasses and stuff and they like um i wonder actually if This
song is a seven minute song because it has like a very long

1273
02:22:01,370 --> 02:22:01,730
intro.

1274
02:22:01,850 --> 02:22:02,810
I wonder if they keep it.

1275
02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:05,310
I'm curious.

1276
02:22:13,860 --> 02:22:14,800
Let's try it.

1277
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:15,680
Let's see what it's like.

1278
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:19,920
Wait, what was the first one?

1279
02:22:20,140 --> 02:22:20,680

02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:27,220
They put on glasses and go, mmm, Bastian?

1282
02:22:28,060 --> 02:22:28,300
Stop.

1283
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:34,600
I arrive in time for Dear St.J.

1284
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:34,940
Yokosu!

1285
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:36,240
Oh!

1286
02:22:37,540 --> 02:22:38,880
This is the song that I...

1287
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:39,580
I was like...

1288
02:22:41,480 --> 02:22:42,360
This music video?

1289
02:22:42,740 --> 02:22:45,040
Actually, I said Sakura Operation is my favorite music
video?

1290
02:22:45,380 --> 02:22:45,540
No.

1291
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:46,620
This song.

1292
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:48,760
This song is my favorite music video.

1293
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:49,480
Oh my gosh.

1294
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:54,360
Let's go!

1295
02:22:54,700 --> 02:22:57,320
And let's go!

1296
02:22:57,740 --> 02:22:58,120
.

1297
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:15,740
The music video is like half animated.

1298
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:18,640
And

1299
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:25,700
then it's so awesome we put together.

1300
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:30,140
There's like, oh, oh God, it's the hardest songs.

1301
02:23:31,340 --> 02:23:33,300
Oh no, oh no.

1302
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:34,640
Oh no.

1303
02:23:38,510 --> 02:23:39,330
Don't fight.

1304
02:23:39,430 --> 02:23:39,590
Don't fight.

1305
02:23:39,590 --> 02:23:40,370
Don't fight.

1306
02:23:57,410 --> 02:24:01,350
This is the weirdest medley ever.

1307
02:24:07,230 --> 02:24:09,910
This is the weirdest medley ever.

1308
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:31,370
Okay, I can't do it anymore.

1309
02:24:33,910 --> 02:24:35,850
It's not even like a good medley.

1310
02:24:37,130 --> 02:24:38,190
It's not even a good medley.

1311
02:24:38,430 --> 02:24:43,290
Like they just, I thought like it would, you know how like
medleys tend to like, the songs bleed into each other.

1312
02:24:43,310 --> 02:24:44,970
No, it just stops.

1313
02:24:46,810 --> 02:24:46,930
Whoops.

1314
02:24:47,630 --> 02:24:48,650
It just stops.

1315
02:24:49,490 --> 02:24:49,490
Oh,

1316
02:24:52,630 --> 02:24:53,150
that was funny.

1317
02:24:53,430 --> 02:24:54,230
Oh, let's see.

1318
02:24:55,910 --> 02:24:57,070
Have a half hour.

1319
02:24:58,610 --> 02:25:00,250
Wow, thanks, Space Ghost.

1320
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:03,790
Always love to have your singing on in the background while
I do stuff.

1321
02:25:05,310 --> 02:25:06,830
Yeah, okay.

1322
02:25:09,470 --> 02:25:10,390
Oh, gosh.

1323
02:25:12,050 --> 02:25:19,650
So, you know, know it's funny that yoko brought up the
graduations i thought if i ever graduate if i ever can do

1324
02:25:19,650 --> 02:25:26,810
like a graduation concert i would want to sing orange riem

1325
02:25:26,810 --> 02:25:41,570
it's a very special song to dempagumi fans and um and uh um
uh like the whole everyone changes their pen light there's

1328
02:26:01,470 --> 02:26:12,710

it's like a song like just kind of like I'll never forget

1329
02:26:12,710 --> 02:26:17,960

1330
02:26:21,470 --> 02:26:26,170

02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:10,660
Oh wait, oh what's the?

1333
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:13,300
Are you okay?

1334
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:14,860
You know, I'm going to start.

1335
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:16,500
To what do you do?

1336
02:27:16,820 --> 02:27:18,500
Orange day, magic,

1337
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:25,020
and Oh boy.

1338
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:28,760
Uh, SEPAGUMBY!

1339
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:43,220
Soba ni'il, I'm so, I'm so important, I'm so much more I
can't go on and I'm going to go When I see my eyes come

1340
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:56,020
together My heart will rise up And I'm not even aware I'm
not even sure But if we don't change it.

1341
02:27:56,020 --> 02:28:00,680
If we're all going to be able to be able to change our
dreams.

1342
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:04,760
But if we don't get it, we won't get hurt.

1343
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:20,000
If we're not going to be able to keep you alive forever,

1344
02:28:37,380 --> 02:28:42,260
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I can't remember the orange rim.

1345
02:28:42,860 --> 02:28:44,840
But I remember the Kira Kira tune one better.

1346
02:28:50,000 --> 02:29:06,480
In the dark dark, orange and cute Like a chivalry-like love,
I'ma zippa-spa-spa-spa Even though I'ma gobbled and go I

1347
02:29:06,480 --> 02:29:17,400
can't stop it, I can't When I see you, when you don't know
The size of the

1348
02:30:28,860 --> 02:30:37,700
Orange Blue Heart Able Able Able Able Able Able

1349
02:30:41,460 --> 02:30:56,700
A A Maw A I Believe Orange Blue More A More

1350
02:31:12,550 --> 02:31:13,830
That was Orange Ream.

1351
02:31:13,970 --> 02:31:15,710
Wow, I can't believe I sung it without crying.

1352
02:31:17,350 --> 02:31:20,030
But I know when I do the Kira Kira tune mix, oh gosh.

1353
02:31:22,930 --> 02:31:23,610
Orange Ream.

1354
02:31:23,770 --> 02:31:29,150
But I should probably start singing some of the sadder songs
that I've been not wanting to do because I'm gonna run out

1355
02:31:29,150 --> 02:31:30,810
of time and then I won't be able to sing them at all.

1356
02:31:32,670 --> 02:31:36,790
Oops, I have no Kini-E-D songs.

1357
02:31:40,690 --> 02:31:42,210
It's crying time.

1358
02:31:43,730 --> 02:31:45,150
I don't know if I want to do...

1359
02:31:45,710 --> 02:31:48,070
I'll do WWD best now.

1360
02:31:50,390 --> 02:31:52,890
And probably do Kira-Kira tune last.

1361
02:31:57,830 --> 02:31:58,850
Let's do it that now.

1362
02:31:59,010 --> 02:31:59,710
We can also do...

1363
02:31:59,710 --> 02:32:01,550
Oh, precious summer too.

1364
02:32:03,310 --> 02:32:04,590
WWD best.

1365
02:32:04,810 --> 02:32:06,130
Since we did WWD and WWD...

1366
02:32:06,150 --> 02:32:13,060
I have to go to the bathroom.

1367
02:32:13,480 --> 02:32:15,000
I have to go to the little ghosty's room.

1368
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:21,020
It's all this tea I'm drinking.

1369
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:24,980
Look how many composers, people involved for the lyrics and
everything.

1370
02:32:25,160 --> 02:32:25,660
It's crazy.

1371
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:31,580
You can hear like some of their past songs in it.

1372
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:35,560
This way.

1373
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:39,440
I looked

1374
02:32:42,920 --> 02:32:57,940
up I looked up I looked up I was trying to get a dream I've
been living And there was a lot of things Just a little bit

1375
02:32:57,940 --> 02:33:09,020
of myself I'm gonna be better I'm gonna be more than the I'm
the God's era I'm the next generation

1376
02:33:59,480 --> 02:34:02,860
It's a little too high for what my voice can do right now,
but it's okay.

1377
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:16,000
Give it to you.

1378
02:34:17,520 --> 02:34:25,760
I can't even get to know you're starting to realize Like I
don't want to know.

1379
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:26,780
I want to know I want to know.

1380
02:34:26,780 --> 02:34:34,920
When you become an adult, now I am, when I am a day, now I
am a day, I am never forget it.

1381
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:37,120
I don't want to give up my feelings.

1382
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:51,660
I love you so much, just so, just, just so, just so love you
more so, Wenn亢 Because the future Their lives are so vibrant

1383
02:34:56,160 --> 02:35:28,440
Oh, you're a dancer Don't you're a boy

1384
02:35:36,430 --> 02:35:46,730
Denba net If it's a new hero That's why Why'd, why'd he got
to beена live, live, one Thank you, I'm a singer I'm a kid,

1385
02:35:46,830 --> 02:35:47,330
love, love, love, love

1386
02:37:07,990 --> 02:37:15,670
Oh, it's hard to tell if you're like not a super DEMPA fan
obviously if you don't know DEMPA so much but like a lot of

1387
02:37:15,670 --> 02:37:20,850
the lyrics kind of reference their old songs or reference
the members as you could see they even said Orange Ream

1388
02:37:20,850 --> 02:37:22,610
which was a song that I just sang

1389
02:37:25,650 --> 02:37:34,430
The choreography for the dance too like is a lot of a lot of
their old choreo and stuff and the music video just

1390
02:37:34,430 --> 02:37:45,490
references a lot of stuff too it's one big love song to like
Tempagumi and their fans so it's so awesome it's so awesome

1391
02:37:45,490 --> 02:37:50,410
it's so awesome and it's such a pretty song it's so fun and
yeah you notice that?

1392
02:37:55,890 --> 02:38:08,090
I love Dempa End of an era for sure But they're legends So
their legacy will live on Because they've changed so much

1393
02:38:08,090 --> 02:38:19,250
They've influenced so much So I know that People will
continue loving Dempa They said that their story is ending

1394
02:38:19,250 --> 02:38:27,990
So I wonder If that means like Like another group will come
Maybe not Dumpagumi Inc, but...

1395
02:38:28,930 --> 02:38:30,030
What could be...

1396
02:38:30,030 --> 02:38:30,810
What could it be?

1397
02:38:31,730 --> 02:38:32,330
Electric...

1398
02:38:32,330 --> 02:38:33,550
Electric Gumi Company.

1399
02:38:34,750 --> 02:38:35,350
Something.

1400
02:38:37,730 --> 02:38:38,270
But yeah.

1401
02:38:39,330 --> 02:38:40,170
And I know...

1402
02:38:40,170 --> 02:38:40,630
I...

1403
02:38:40,630 --> 02:38:41,050
I know...

1404
02:38:41,050 --> 02:38:41,830
Or...

1405
02:38:41,830 --> 02:38:42,730
Rather...

1406
02:38:42,730 --> 02:38:43,870
They all...

1407
02:38:44,590 --> 02:38:48,990
They all, like, love Akiva so much and try to keep that
spirit of Akiva alive too.

1408
02:38:49,170 --> 02:38:49,870
So I hope that...

1409
02:38:51,110 --> 02:38:51,710
Um...

1410
02:38:52,550 --> 02:38:52,850
That...

1411
02:38:53,590 --> 02:38:54,190
Uh...

1412
02:38:56,250 --> 02:39:01,250
like that continues to may become a VTuber group.

1413
02:39:01,410 --> 02:39:08,290
Actually, Deer Stage has a VTuber group called Deer's
Company no, sorry, Gem's Company called Gem's Company

1414
02:39:09,670 --> 02:39:18,310
they're part of Deer Stage and actually one of the
ex-members of Dempogumi, Nemoto Nagi, is a VTuber so you can

1415
02:39:18,310 --> 02:39:29,830
find her by her name Nemoto Nagi she goes by the same name
as her VTuber self too So, yeah, Gem's Company is actually

1416
02:39:29,830 --> 02:39:30,430
affiliated.

1417
02:39:30,810 --> 02:39:36,290
It's like a collaboration between Deer Stage and Square
Enix, I believe.

1418
02:39:37,050 --> 02:39:39,510
So, I didn't know that about Gem's Company.

1419
02:39:39,910 --> 02:39:42,050
Yeah, Deer Stage is everywhere.

1420
02:39:43,750 --> 02:39:44,690
Isn't that crazy?

1421
02:39:46,090 --> 02:39:46,990
It also tried Vita.

1422
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:48,810
Oh, yeah, she did a little bit, right?

1423
02:39:49,790 --> 02:39:53,210
There's one Gem's Company song that I love so much.

1424
02:39:54,130 --> 02:39:55,410
Hold on, let me see if I can find it.

1425
02:39:56,950 --> 02:39:58,390
It's one of the solo songs.

1426
02:39:58,530 --> 02:39:59,550
It's not like a...

1427
02:40:00,170 --> 02:40:01,890
It's not like one of the group songs.

1428
02:40:03,670 --> 02:40:04,310
But, um...

1429
02:40:05,250 --> 02:40:12,250
If I were to ever make a song, if I were to ever get my own
original song, um, like a cool song, I would reference this.

1430
02:40:12,350 --> 02:40:14,070
I would, like, be like, I want something like this.

1431
02:40:14,950 --> 02:40:15,170
Wait.

1432
02:40:15,670 --> 02:40:16,430
I can't remember.

1433
02:40:16,510 --> 02:40:17,210
It's so sad, though.

1434
02:40:17,210 --> 02:40:19,610
I can't remember the name of it because my brain is dumb.

1435
02:40:20,530 --> 02:40:20,670
Wait.

1436
02:40:24,670 --> 02:40:25,630
I've heard of Gems Company.

1437
02:40:25,650 --> 02:40:26,110
Yeah!

1438
02:40:28,030 --> 02:40:28,550
Yeah!

1439
02:40:29,470 --> 02:40:33,390
I'll find it later and I'll post it on, um, on Twitter.

1440
02:40:35,130 --> 02:40:36,910
Or I'll post it in the comments or something.

1441
02:40:38,310 --> 02:40:40,010
Why can't I remember the name of it though?

1442
02:40:40,910 --> 02:40:44,550
Oh, I found it though!

1443
02:40:44,590 --> 02:40:45,130
I found it!

1444
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:50,000
I just found the song, actually.

1445
02:40:50,900 --> 02:40:52,180
I'll just post it here.

1446
02:40:55,580 --> 02:40:56,100
It's...

1447
02:40:57,520 --> 02:40:58,560
Shojo-sensu!

1448
02:40:59,460 --> 02:40:59,860
paradox

1449
02:41:06,720 --> 02:41:14,260
manifesting a mint ori song we'll see, I don't know we'll
see, I don't know, I don't know do an Akiva themed original

1450
02:41:14,260 --> 02:41:29,300
song someday, maybe maybe maybe I can get a panda boy I
don't know I don't know, I don't know yeah, well there was

1451
02:41:29,300 --> 02:41:39,000
one group that I really really loved also it was kind of
when like I wasn't like you know when like sorry I keep

1452
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:48,680
saying like so after my kamiyoshi graduated from Dempa it
kind of was in like a mourning period so I ended up I

1453
02:41:48,680 --> 02:41:56,220
obviously still supported them but I ended up falling for
another group called Engaging who was also a dear stage

1454
02:41:56,220 --> 02:42:00,420
group and one of my favorite member my favorite member of
that group group.

1455
02:42:01,180 --> 02:42:03,240
She also loved Nemu.

1456
02:42:03,780 --> 02:42:05,020
Nemu was her Oshi too.

1457
02:42:05,740 --> 02:42:10,860
So I have a Cheki album completely full of just Chekis from
Engaging.

1458
02:42:11,740 --> 02:42:18,100
They were so great and their music was all composed by a
music artist that I love Mosaic Wave.

1459
02:42:19,720 --> 02:42:27,780
And so because it was Mosaic Wave and Deer Stage together, I
was like, This is my Kami group.

1460
02:42:27,900 --> 02:42:29,400
This is, like, the best group ever.

1461
02:42:29,900 --> 02:42:33,140
And then they ended up disbanding during the pandemic.

1462
02:42:34,360 --> 02:42:42,700
So, I, uh, um, I've been, um, it was, like, for a long time,
I kind of stopped liking idols.

1463
02:42:43,340 --> 02:42:45,880
Um, I focused a lot on VTubers.

1464
02:42:46,140 --> 02:42:52,600
I kind of stopped liking idols because I was so devastated
by losing them.

1465
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:55,580
My, my favorite member of the group, actually, Ria.

1466
02:42:56,060 --> 02:42:57,100
Ria in Dempagumi.

1467
02:42:57,780 --> 02:43:00,440
She's one of the new members, but she came from Engaging.

1468
02:43:02,480 --> 02:43:08,840
And they also got another member from Engaging that went to
Dempagumi called her name's Aizawa Kozue.

1469
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:15,480
You might recognize her because she's a really popular
dancer, like on Nico Nico and stuff like that.

1470
02:43:17,380 --> 02:43:25,860
And so, but she graduated from the group because she had
some health issues.

1471
02:43:26,060 --> 02:43:33,180
unfortunately um but ria is still in the group and she was
in engaging um she was a member of engaging when they were

1472
02:43:33,180 --> 02:43:43,780
around but my kamiyoshi well not kamiyoshi my oshi from
engaging she uh she basically like left the internet so but

1473
02:43:43,780 --> 02:43:52,080
yesterday she posted she made a post on instagram because
because of the dempagumi announcement so i was like my oh

1474
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:59,180
she my oh she posted yeah I understand when my Yoshi
graduated and nearly stopped watching VTubers.

1475
02:43:59,580 --> 02:44:01,760
Yeah, I get it.

1476
02:44:02,380 --> 02:44:03,120
I get it.

1477
02:44:03,420 --> 02:44:06,240
But now I have some other idols that I really, really love.

1478
02:44:07,180 --> 02:44:12,680
So, and I still love Dempagumi and I will love them until
their very last day and beyond.

1479
02:44:13,620 --> 02:44:14,680
So, yeah.

1480
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:26,920
Sometimes it just takes some time to get back into, get back
into, but you, you know, You know.

1481
02:44:29,280 --> 02:44:32,760
If you like something, you know, you don't have to give it
up.

1482
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:37,840
Like, for me, I liked idols, but it was hard to find someone
else to support and everything.

1483
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:39,760
Den, den, passion till the end.

1484
02:44:41,220 --> 02:44:42,540
Luckily, I found a certain maid.

1485
02:44:43,420 --> 02:44:44,760
You found another maid?

1486
02:44:45,640 --> 02:44:47,260
I missed the maid with the magic voice.

1487
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:49,520
Stop it.

1488
02:44:51,080 --> 02:44:51,900
Stop it.

1489
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:56,020
Gotta give yourself a grief period.

1490
02:44:56,060 --> 02:44:57,060
for some graduations.

1491
02:44:58,220 --> 02:44:59,140
Idols are very ephemeral.

1492
02:44:59,600 --> 02:45:00,460
They can be, right?

1493
02:45:01,060 --> 02:45:03,640
But with them, Pagumi, I've had them for so long.

1494
02:45:03,860 --> 02:45:05,020
I cannot...

1495
02:45:05,020 --> 02:45:06,380
I can only, you know...

1496
02:45:06,380 --> 02:45:12,280
Obviously, no matter how much time I had with them, I would
wish them off with a smile, but I can only feel like this...

1497
02:45:12,280 --> 02:45:13,100
It feels right.

1498
02:45:13,320 --> 02:45:18,540
Prior to me, it's just like I never thought this day would
come, but also I feel like they've been around for so long.

1499
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:19,020
It's okay.

1500
02:45:19,460 --> 02:45:20,000
It's okay.

1501
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:23,540
I'm going to go grab some more water.

1502
02:45:26,940 --> 02:45:35,780
I'm going to sing So give me just a second to go grab some
more water And then Wait, wait, never mind I have 10 minutes

1503
02:45:35,780 --> 02:45:40,080
Oh my gosh, never mind I'm not going to go grab more water
I'm going to sing Precious Summer

1504
02:45:46,380 --> 02:45:58,180
I only have 10 minutes until my karaoke subscription expires
Oh no Oh my god I don't think I could sing this one very

1505
02:45:58,180 --> 02:46:00,060
well either but that's okay

1506
02:46:09,820 --> 02:46:10,560
Let's go

1507
02:47:07,910 --> 02:47:09,310
Sorry I can't do it

1508
02:47:25,460 --> 02:47:32,480
I'm tired This song is so fun though I know the song I know
the calls I don't want to do that Are

1509
02:48:15,220 --> 02:48:17,840
you feeling it?

1510
02:48:17,900 --> 02:48:18,980
Ah, not to something,

1511
02:48:23,470 --> 02:48:23,830
some ice.

1512
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:11,060
Oh,

1513
02:49:29,990 --> 02:49:32,050
I'm so out of breath.

1514
02:49:32,830 --> 02:49:33,350
Happy night.

1515
02:49:50,300 --> 02:49:51,040
Oh,

1516
02:50:04,320 --> 02:50:04,960
I'm so tired.

1517
02:50:07,860 --> 02:50:09,600
I feel a pressure summer.

1518
02:50:09,880 --> 02:50:10,420
No, it's precious.

1519
02:50:13,240 --> 02:50:15,120
I felt the pressure there, though.

1520
02:50:15,520 --> 02:50:16,280
Holy cow.

1521
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:20,720
My brain just said, I don't think I'm going to read anymore.

1522
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:21,700
Oh.

1523
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:25,640
Oh my god.

1524
02:50:28,140 --> 02:50:28,940
No break time.

1525
02:50:29,420 --> 02:50:30,260
No break time.

1526
02:50:32,980 --> 02:50:33,300
Wait.

1527
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:34,660
Is this song really fast, too?

1528
02:50:34,820 --> 02:50:36,120
They're all so fast.

1529
02:50:36,880 --> 02:50:38,120
I love the high energy of that one.

1530
02:50:38,280 --> 02:50:39,180
It's so fun.

1531
02:50:39,260 --> 02:50:40,860
It's one of my favorite newer songs.

1532
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:43,440
That tempo has put out.

1533
02:50:43,440 --> 02:50:44,540
Mm-hmm.

1534
02:50:53,870 --> 02:50:57,770
I don't

1535
02:51:07,300 --> 02:51:08,140

1536
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:08,540
.

1537
02:51:10,380 --> 02:51:15,720
Oh, this song, the music video is so awesome because they
sent the song into space with a weather balloon.

1538
02:51:16,160 --> 02:51:18,100
Oh my god, what is this?

1539
02:51:18,740 --> 02:51:19,200

Cute gibberish.

My head got off.

1554
02:53:11,980 --> 02:53:13,180

I have five minutes left, so...

1558
02:53:32,460 --> 02:53:33,760
I won't do Evergreen.

1559
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:35,120
I can save that for another day.

1560
02:53:35,660 --> 02:53:39,320
Oh, I think I said I would do Kira Kira tune last.

1561
02:53:40,700 --> 02:53:41,940
Oh, I didn't do Dem Party Night.

1562
02:53:42,120 --> 02:53:42,920
My damn.

1563
02:53:43,140 --> 02:53:45,580
Dem Party Night over the world.

1564
02:53:45,960 --> 02:53:51,880
Oh, we're in vandalism.

1565
02:53:52,780 --> 02:53:53,480
Ah, damn.

1566
02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:56,120
Oh.

1567
02:53:56,560 --> 02:53:58,780
Oh, and it, wait, maybe I have time for both of these.

1568
02:54:00,820 --> 02:54:02,100
Maybe you have time for this one?

1569
02:54:02,860 --> 02:54:03,880
And for Kira-Kira-Chune.

1570
02:54:06,060 --> 02:54:06,840
I love this one.

1571
02:54:06,940 --> 02:54:07,940
It's got Haruka Kanatai.

1572
02:54:09,560 --> 02:54:10,580
This one is so pretty.

1573
02:54:11,240 --> 02:54:12,860
Maybe I'll do a short version of it.

1574
02:54:14,080 --> 02:54:15,320
I guess we need a part two, maybe.

1575
02:54:31,100 --> 02:54:33,180
To the future

1576
02:54:51,880 --> 02:55:00,940
The future I can't solve the Unstoppable way for the car The
darkened road Where the darkened road leads to come No doubt

1577
02:55:00,940 --> 02:55:12,800
Sometimes I'll be the way I'll see you again I'll be back
again I'll start again Choose the thing I'll be the one One

1578
02:55:12,800 --> 02:55:14,140
thing I'll lose

1579
02:55:45,040 --> 02:55:56,440
I'm so excited The real My real feelings It's all about My
own It's all about It's about A little bit over The small

1583
02:57:36,070 --> 02:57:54,230
I wonder if it'll let me finish singing Kira Kira tune.

1584
02:57:54,230 --> 02:57:55,150

melt in the morning.

1593
02:58:45,750 --> 02:58:49,850
I want to eat it, but if I eat it, I'll regret it.

1594
02:58:50,530 --> 02:58:56,110
For the right life for me, I'm going to lie to myself.

1595
02:58:56,570 --> 02:59:01,330
I'm going to tell you the pieces of the pieces.

1596
02:59:01,350 --> 02:59:05,610
When I'm an adult, I'm going to become an adult.

1597
02:59:06,390 --> 02:59:09,110
I'm going to give up.

1598
02:59:10,950 --> 02:59:12,130
I'm just like that.

1599
02:59:12,130 --> 02:59:16,030
You're just like that.

1600
02:59:16,030 --> 02:59:17,190
Just that, that's all.

1601
02:59:17,290 --> 02:59:29,170
This world is all, all the energy, all the special, all the
tears are just like they're flying, and they're all the

1602
02:59:29,170 --> 02:59:29,170
stars.

1603
02:59:29,480 --> 02:59:33,590
And tonight, everything's going to change.

1604
02:59:34,770 --> 02:59:35,090
Oh!

1605
02:59:46,090 --> 02:59:47,590
Like you, like you're here for the day.

1606
02:59:49,750 --> 02:59:52,990
And like you're here for me, I'm glad you're here.

1607
02:59:53,610 --> 03:00:00,150
I'm here for you to hold my hand so I can't forget that
you're here.

1608
03:00:01,590 --> 03:00:03,950
I'm here for you to see me.

1609
03:00:04,090 --> 03:00:05,270
When you grow up,

1610
03:00:08,630 --> 03:00:14,450
you grow up to be able to give up.

1611
03:00:18,630 --> 03:00:19,630
There's no way for me.

1612
03:00:19,630 --> 03:00:33,650
Just that, that's all that this world is more than me, it's
so sweet and we're still no one knows we're in our season.

1613
03:00:34,630 --> 03:00:39,450
I'm sure you'll be able to take you to the world.

1614
03:00:39,610 --> 03:00:48,370
The world's going to more and more See, more, more, more,
more, more, more reopened.

1615
03:00:49,290 --> 03:00:55,270
Doki, Doki, get a title now, even though, I don't know how
the day's a dream, I'm not to stop it.

1616
03:00:55,550 --> 03:01:04,470
I sometimes have a quarrel, but I'm even smiling, with a
smile and a smile and I'm going to flash my tears with my

1617
03:01:04,470 --> 03:01:08,630
hands and hands and hands and I'll be the future, I'm gonna
come and get going.

1618
03:01:08,950 --> 03:01:10,850
That's my birthday, my birthday, you're together.

1619
03:01:10,850 --> 03:01:11,770
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

1620
03:01:11,770 --> 03:01:26,370
You're here, just so that, that's all, this world is more
than work, it's special, it's nice, because you're just so

1621
03:01:26,370 --> 03:02:06,500
much to get me, I want you to be here you're here, just so
that's all that's all I think

1622
03:02:25,680 --> 03:02:26,820
I got that last one wrong.

1623
03:02:28,660 --> 03:02:31,400
6-2-6-6-6-6-6, wait.

1624
03:02:32,040 --> 03:02:32,580
6-2.

1625
03:02:32,720 --> 03:02:33,580
Wait, I said moot-6.

1626
03:02:33,580 --> 03:02:33,940
I meant to.

1627
03:02:34,620 --> 03:02:35,580
6-6-2.

1628
03:02:36,220 --> 03:02:36,540
Where's it?

1629
03:02:36,580 --> 03:02:36,800
Wait.

1630
03:02:37,220 --> 03:02:37,780
I don't remember.

1631
03:02:38,240 --> 03:02:38,480
Whatever.

1632
03:02:38,800 --> 03:02:39,220
It's fine.

1633
03:02:39,360 --> 03:02:40,120
I got the other one.

1634
03:02:49,840 --> 03:02:51,900
That was a kira-kira tune.

1635
03:02:52,340 --> 03:02:55,900
The other one that I did a little bit of was um, it's a car.

1636
03:02:56,900 --> 03:03:00,200
It's a car, Kanata?

1637
03:03:01,020 --> 03:03:01,580
I think.

1638
03:03:02,740 --> 03:03:03,160
Short.

1639
03:03:04,360 --> 03:03:05,400
And then...

1640
03:03:05,400 --> 03:03:07,840
Kira Kira Tune.

1641
03:03:09,900 --> 03:03:10,940
Which, um...

1642
03:03:10,940 --> 03:03:12,560
Which, uh...

1643
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:21,720
When I did a little bit of singing in Akihabara, um, a long
time ago, I would always sing that song.

1644
03:03:22,100 --> 03:03:23,540
Always sing Kira Kira Tune.

1645
03:03:25,900 --> 03:03:27,240
Is the past gone now?

1646
03:03:27,300 --> 03:03:27,780
Let's see!

1647
03:03:28,540 --> 03:03:29,420
Should be, right?

1648
03:03:30,340 --> 03:03:31,300
What if it's not?

1649
03:03:31,480 --> 03:03:32,240
That'd be so bad.

1650
03:03:32,360 --> 03:03:33,280
What if it's so embarrassing?

1651
03:03:33,420 --> 03:03:34,120
I rushed to it.

1652
03:03:35,480 --> 03:03:36,580
I rushed to do it.

1653
03:03:36,640 --> 03:03:38,700
Do it as the last song.

1654
03:03:39,040 --> 03:03:40,220
And it makes 20 songs.

1655
03:03:40,380 --> 03:03:42,160
Here, let's just try it with Kuchikibo.

1656
03:03:45,580 --> 03:03:46,460
Let's see.

1657
03:03:46,760 --> 03:03:46,980
Yeah.

1658
03:03:48,440 --> 03:03:49,440
There it is.

1659
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:50,440
Tojiro.

1660
03:03:51,020 --> 03:03:51,320
Yep.

1661
03:03:52,520 --> 03:03:52,700
Cancel.

1662
03:03:53,400 --> 03:03:53,680
Oh, wait.

1663
03:03:53,860 --> 03:03:54,380
Oh, oh, oops.

1664
03:03:54,760 --> 03:03:55,100
Not cancel.

1665
03:03:55,400 --> 03:03:55,900
There we go.

1666
03:03:56,700 --> 03:03:57,380
Get rid.

1667
03:03:57,560 --> 03:03:58,500
Erase the...

1668
03:03:58,500 --> 03:03:59,420
Erase the yo-yaku.

1669
03:04:01,640 --> 03:04:04,440
I thought it might stop me mid-song, but it didn't.

1670
03:04:06,260 --> 03:04:06,940
I have to pee.

1671
03:04:09,260 --> 03:04:10,960
Oh, I'll leave this up so you can hear it.

1672
03:04:12,040 --> 03:04:12,620
I'll be right back.

1673
03:04:13,880 --> 03:04:14,720
Get some water.

1674
03:04:15,280 --> 03:04:16,520
And go to the bathroom.

1675
03:04:17,640 --> 03:04:18,000
BRB.

1676
03:04:19,440 --> 03:04:19,800
Tempagumi.

1677
03:04:20,320 --> 03:04:21,160
It's my Oshi group.

1678
03:04:21,860 --> 03:04:23,020
For more than a decade, too.

1679
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:23,900
It still doesn't feel real.

1680
03:04:24,080 --> 03:04:24,380
I know.

1681
03:04:24,960 --> 03:04:26,140
Your karaoke cheered me up a lot.

1682
03:04:26,240 --> 03:04:26,900
Thank you so much.

1683
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:27,680
Thank you.

1684
03:04:28,920 --> 03:04:30,340
Thank you.

1685
03:04:30,560 --> 03:04:31,140
Oh, be happy.

1686
03:04:31,600 --> 03:04:33,020
Be happy.

1687
03:06:34,120 --> 03:06:34,820
I'm back.

1688
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:38,700
I'm back, everybody.

1689
03:06:40,480 --> 03:06:40,580
Cease.

1690
03:06:40,740 --> 03:06:42,020
Cease all activities.

1691
03:06:43,380 --> 03:06:43,920
Cease.

1692
03:06:44,420 --> 03:06:45,380
Cease your activities.

1693
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:46,420
I'm back.

1694
03:06:49,180 --> 03:06:49,780
Yippee!

1695
03:06:51,040 --> 03:06:53,200
20 songs of...

1696
03:06:53,200 --> 03:06:55,280
Well, basically...

1697
03:06:55,280 --> 03:07:07,200
Almost 20 songs of full-depth but-gummy power do you guys
did you guys feel the power of Dempogumi in fact you only

1698
03:07:07,200 --> 03:07:18,240
got like the smallest fraction of Dempogumi's power they're
the most powerful thank you for the karaoke no thank you I

1699
03:07:18,240 --> 03:07:27,300
want to see if they have a song on here real quick I wonder
even though this song doesn't oh wait you can't see anymore

1700
03:07:27,300 --> 03:07:29,440
ha ha ha ha I'll keep it a secret.

1701
03:07:29,660 --> 03:07:30,500
Thank you, thank you.

1702
03:07:32,980 --> 03:07:33,860
Thank you.

1703
03:07:39,900 --> 03:07:41,620
I'll keep this song a secret.

1704
03:07:41,900 --> 03:07:43,000
Maybe I'll perform it in the future.

1705
03:07:43,120 --> 03:07:45,660
I always have wanted to perform this with a group of people
though.

1706
03:07:46,780 --> 03:07:49,380
So I think the song does best as a group.

1707
03:07:49,800 --> 03:07:50,760
Oh, they do have it!

1708
03:07:52,220 --> 03:07:52,820
Oh, no, they don't.

1709
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:54,060
They don't have it.

1710
03:07:54,820 --> 03:07:56,220
So I can never sing it.

1711
03:07:58,100 --> 03:07:58,960
Never mind.

1712
03:08:00,400 --> 03:08:03,180
I can't sing it in karaoke.

1713
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:07,160
But maybe one day I can sing it like on a stage.

1714
03:08:09,260 --> 03:08:10,640
But it's better as a group song.

1715
03:08:14,100 --> 03:08:16,320
It's also better as a live song.

1716
03:08:16,660 --> 03:08:21,420
Like the song itself is good, but experiencing it live is
way better.

1717
03:08:28,110 --> 03:08:28,430
Yeah.

1718
03:08:28,710 --> 03:08:31,270
So I used to perform a little.

1719
03:08:31,550 --> 03:08:38,530
Actually, I don't want listen to this music anymore i'm
gonna i'm gonna turn off this and we're gonna listen to um

1720
03:08:38,530 --> 03:08:57,030
let's see what dempagumi music can i put on um dempagumi uh
what's that what um it's not midi oh my gosh what's the um

1721
03:08:57,030 --> 03:09:04,710
the small the not small how i can't i think of it uh There's
so many more songs that I wanted to sing too, but I would

1722
03:09:04,710 --> 03:09:06,590
have messed up every single one of them.

1723
03:09:06,690 --> 03:09:07,310
So you know what's okay.

1724
03:09:07,850 --> 03:09:08,790
Not lo-fi.

1725
03:09:09,230 --> 03:09:10,030
Not chiptune.

1726
03:09:10,150 --> 03:09:11,510
Like when it's a music box.

1727
03:09:11,610 --> 03:09:11,770
Music.

1728
03:09:11,970 --> 03:09:14,510
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1729
03:09:20,530 --> 03:09:21,990
Oh, oh, oh.

1730
03:09:25,110 --> 03:09:25,510
Orgore.

1731
03:09:30,070 --> 03:09:31,130
Here we go.

1732
03:09:31,430 --> 03:09:31,830
Orgore.

1733
03:09:33,410 --> 03:09:34,790
I can just repeat this.

1734
03:09:35,850 --> 03:09:37,010
Oh, this has an ad.

1735
03:09:37,390 --> 03:09:37,710
Hold on.

1736
03:09:40,630 --> 03:09:41,430
Let me...

1737
03:09:41,430 --> 03:09:42,730
Oh my

1738
03:09:46,590 --> 03:09:49,290
god, that was so fucking loud.

1739
03:09:50,370 --> 03:09:51,210
What even was that?

1740
03:09:52,630 --> 03:09:55,730
I exited out of it so fast I couldn't even tell that I
just...

1741
03:09:56,250 --> 03:10:01,430
I just went... I exited out of it so fast it took me to eBay
where I was looking at Metal Gear items.

1742
03:10:03,370 --> 03:10:04,370
Okay, here we go.

1743
03:10:04,890 --> 03:10:06,010
This should be good now.

1744
03:10:06,290 --> 03:10:08,850
Well then I'm gonna turn it down so it doesn't jump scare
me.

1745
03:10:14,030 --> 03:10:15,830
There we go.

1746
03:10:16,790 --> 03:10:18,030
eBay jump scare.

1747
03:10:18,390 --> 03:10:21,190
I found these cute little patches of Kedotan.

1748
03:10:30,350 --> 03:10:30,390
Yeah.

1749
03:10:32,670 --> 03:10:33,390
Um.

1750
03:10:35,670 --> 03:10:37,410
What was I saying before that?

1751
03:10:40,130 --> 03:10:42,370
What was I saying before that?

1752
03:10:44,270 --> 03:10:45,630
Don't make me cry.

1753
03:10:45,650 --> 03:10:58,530
I don't know so oh yeah something about performing yeah yeah
yeah so I used to perform a little bit and and I would

1754
03:10:58,530 --> 03:11:04,790
always sing Kira Kira tune and oh yeah because I was talking
about the song that I wanted to sing with a group of people

1755
03:11:05,770 --> 03:11:16,850
when I would perform a little bit I would kind of go crazy
like like like I'm the type that like feels the music you

1756
03:11:16,850 --> 03:11:32,230
know so like um like stage diving or rolling on the ground
or like climbing things is nothing new to me but um not that

1757
03:11:32,230 --> 03:11:43,150
i had like a huge enough crowd to stage dive into but stuff
similar like that we know you'd go crazy that goes about

1758
03:11:43,150 --> 03:11:55,110
saying it's one of the sad um the sad things about being a
v-tubers that you know i'm stuck here digitally so i can

1759
03:11:55,110 --> 03:12:04,970
never perform that way with you guys but that's okay just a
little bit maybe is that how you died i don't know

1760
03:12:08,730 --> 03:12:17,950
imagining mint in a mosh pit yeah i did i did there are some
like um i very distinctly remember being in a mosh pit for

1761
03:12:17,950 --> 03:12:19,550
an idol group called Passcode.

1762
03:12:21,250 --> 03:12:22,930
I didn't realize this was so short.

1763
03:12:23,170 --> 03:12:23,470
Hold on.

1764
03:12:23,530 --> 03:12:26,730
Maybe we don't do...

1765
03:12:26,730 --> 03:12:28,190
Let's see what other ones they have.

1766
03:12:28,370 --> 03:12:29,210
They have...

1767
03:12:29,210 --> 03:12:30,150
Oh, they have WWE...

1768
03:12:30,150 --> 03:12:31,050
Wait, that one's even shorter.

1769
03:12:31,410 --> 03:12:33,150
Oh, this one's a whole playlist.

1770
03:12:43,390 --> 03:12:45,950
You guys, I've got a bit of a wild streak about me.

1771
03:12:46,750 --> 03:12:48,630
But I think it's just because I like passion.

1772
03:12:48,650 --> 03:12:59,670
And I like, so, you know, I find that, um, that in, like,
uh, in like, idols like that or something, you'll get a lot

1773
03:12:59,670 --> 03:13:01,550
of passionate, crazy things.

1774
03:13:01,810 --> 03:13:04,150
Like, you know, I don't care if they spit on me.

1775
03:13:04,490 --> 03:13:06,330
They're feeling it in the moment, you know?

1776
03:13:07,510 --> 03:13:09,190
Just throw the monitor in the crowd.

1777
03:13:09,330 --> 03:13:09,850
We get it.

1778
03:13:11,890 --> 03:13:14,550
Building you a robot body to stage dive with boss.

1779
03:13:16,150 --> 03:13:16,910

1784
03:13:50,650 --> 03:13:53,150
So I hope I'll I won it.

1785
03:13:56,370 --> 03:14:00,890
This is one of the songs I didn't sing, but this is the one
that I, that is my Kamioshi's graduation.

1786
03:14:15,110 --> 03:14:16,270
Minukiwa Gundam, yeah!

1787
03:14:17,030 --> 03:14:18,710
Oh my gosh, can you imagine a Gundam jumping?

1788
03:14:19,350 --> 03:14:22,270
Like, it would have to be made of like cardboard.

1789
03:14:22,610 --> 03:14:23,610
If it's too heavy.

1790
03:14:26,850 --> 03:14:29,030
You'll be a robot at Afkai, we can carry you?

1791
03:14:29,130 --> 03:14:29,530
Yes!

1792
03:14:31,490 --> 03:14:32,550
But I'm borrowing V.

1793
03:14:32,570 --> 03:14:35,850
Shojo's tech for that, so I don't know if they'll be very
happy about it.

1794
03:14:42,520 --> 03:14:44,600
Dan, thank you for the 20 gifted, thank you!

1795
03:14:46,020 --> 03:14:48,180
You definitely could have virtually stave dived yesterday.

1796
03:14:48,520 --> 03:14:50,800
I wonder if they could strap a camera on a docky.

1797
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:54,060
That'd be awesome!

1798
03:14:57,040 --> 03:14:58,540
So excited to see you at Afkai.

1799
03:14:58,680 --> 03:14:59,080
Me too!

1800
03:15:09,570 --> 03:15:18,730
overlord the song i only got to see no i got to see live
twice i got to see it in my last japan trip i was so happy

1801
03:15:18,730 --> 03:15:29,170
oh my gosh i was so happy to see dempo last japan trip i was
it was so awesome it was just a mini live so they only did a

1802
03:15:29,170 --> 03:15:37,990
few songs but um but the first time i saw them ever was a
release event which is when they like, you know, it is what

1803
03:15:37,990 --> 03:15:40,890
it sounds like when they release an album or a single.

1804
03:15:41,490 --> 03:15:42,730
In that case, it was an album.

1805
03:15:45,590 --> 03:15:49,390
And I got to take a checkie, my one and only checkie with my
Kami Oshi.

1806
03:15:50,250 --> 03:15:53,410
And, but I got to see them.

1807
03:15:53,650 --> 03:16:03,070
I could barely see them because I was way in the back and I,
there were many tall people around, but I could still feel

1808
03:16:03,070 --> 03:16:04,670
their energy, so it was really great.

1809
03:16:06,010 --> 03:16:07,990
This was my first time hearing these songs with this group.

1810
03:16:08,130 --> 03:16:10,790
I love that it was more than just a karaoke, but stories
about them as well.

1811
03:16:11,570 --> 03:16:13,270
Really got through how cool they were.

1812
03:16:13,630 --> 03:16:14,510
I'm glad!

1813
03:16:15,650 --> 03:16:16,450
I'm so happy!

1814
03:16:17,250 --> 03:16:19,050
It was the first time you saw them, the six-person group.

1815
03:16:19,290 --> 03:16:19,410
Yes!

1816
03:16:20,030 --> 03:16:21,990
Yes, so it was still the six of them.

1817
03:16:24,030 --> 03:16:24,750
I never...

1818
03:16:24,750 --> 03:16:29,650
I'll be honest, I didn't even know about Dempagumi when they
were a five-person group, so...

1819
03:16:32,510 --> 03:16:34,630
I got into them when they were a six-person group.

1820
03:16:37,830 --> 03:16:52,230
This is another Psyche K song When did, let's see Den Den
Passion came out 2013 So I've known about them for For For

1821
03:16:52,230 --> 03:17:08,610
over a decade I've been a fan Wow Yeah It's just a little
bit over a decade Yeah so sad that i couldn't be around for

1822
03:17:08,610 --> 03:17:20,410
all 16 years but that's okay i still got to see them for or
like follow them for so long and maybe later i can post some

1823
03:17:20,410 --> 03:17:32,230
pictures of like my ita bag and it's double-sided um back in
the day too i used to be like not involved with japanese

1824
03:17:32,230 --> 03:17:43,150
fans but i would talk with a few and um i had one One person
drew some Nemu badges and stuff and they sent them to me

1825
03:17:43,150 --> 03:17:44,770
because I couldn't go to the event.

1826
03:17:45,210 --> 03:17:48,610
So should have gone with a tall, strong friend to climb on
their shoulders.

1827
03:17:48,930 --> 03:17:49,610
I wish.

1828
03:17:50,230 --> 03:17:57,910
Oh, another time that I saw Dempagumi was also, it was at
Tokyo Idol Festival.

1829
03:17:58,530 --> 03:18:05,270
And I waited about eight hours in line, like in the venue,
to get to the very front.

1830
03:18:05,650 --> 03:18:08,830
And I saw them front row.

1831
03:18:09,970 --> 03:18:10,710
Front row.

1832
03:18:10,890 --> 03:18:12,150
I got to see Debogumi.

1833
03:18:14,630 --> 03:18:19,610
So it was, it was a, I like, packed calorie mate in my bag.

1834
03:18:19,770 --> 03:18:23,930
And like, when I got hungry, I would, I would, like, bend
down and I would munch and munch and munch.

1835
03:18:24,090 --> 03:18:28,070
And then I would stand back up and cheer for the other
groups that were performing.

1836
03:18:28,570 --> 03:18:31,510
And then eventually I scooted myself to the very, very front
row.

1837
03:18:31,970 --> 03:18:33,490
And it was so, oh.

1838
03:18:42,680 --> 03:18:43,320
Eight hours?

1839
03:18:45,540 --> 03:18:46,460
Yeah, I waited.

1840
03:18:46,580 --> 03:18:48,060
I was, like, so determined.

1841
03:18:49,760 --> 03:18:49,820
Um.

1842
03:18:51,540 --> 03:18:51,940
So.

1843
03:18:53,100 --> 03:18:54,500
Ah, it was so awesome.

1844
03:18:55,260 --> 03:18:56,020
And, um.

1845
03:18:56,480 --> 03:18:57,300
It was tiring.

1846
03:18:57,420 --> 03:19:00,420
I mean, like, because there was, like, it was just so much
energy.

1847
03:19:00,980 --> 03:19:02,680
Like, because from so many groups.

1848
03:19:03,320 --> 03:19:07,720
Um, but it was a, it was honestly, I would do it again in a
heartbeat.

1849
03:19:08,300 --> 03:19:09,140
And, um.

1850
03:19:15,750 --> 03:19:17,670
Did I sing this one?

1851
03:19:20,680 --> 03:19:21,740
No, I wanted to sing this one.

1852
03:19:21,880 --> 03:19:23,000
This one's Kitto Kitto, ne!

1853
03:19:34,050 --> 03:19:34,930
But, um...

1854
03:19:34,930 --> 03:19:36,790
Yeah, so I saw them then.

1855
03:19:37,610 --> 03:19:41,030
I saw them last trip.

1856
03:19:41,210 --> 03:19:41,910
So that's three.

1857
03:19:42,910 --> 03:19:44,230
And then I saw my kami-oshi.

1858
03:19:46,330 --> 03:19:49,410
I saw my kami-oshi perform in her.

1859
03:19:49,430 --> 03:19:55,790

Thank you for introducing me to Dempogumi Inc.

This was a beautiful stream.

Thank you for singing for us today.

Yeah.

1872
03:21:05,860 --> 03:21:08,400
Actually, another idol that I really love, her name is
Aonian.

1873
03:21:08,880 --> 03:21:11,600
She was a part of Dempah for a little bit.

1874
03:21:11,880 --> 03:21:13,560
But now she's a part of Arcana Project.

1875
03:21:14,080 --> 03:21:15,580
I'm in Yokohama right now.

1876
03:21:31,230 --> 03:21:32,090
What is this one?

1877
03:21:32,510 --> 03:21:32,730
Oh.

1878
03:21:36,110 --> 03:21:37,030
Phantom of the Kill.

1879
03:21:38,130 --> 03:21:40,010
I actually don't know this one as well.

1880
03:21:42,830 --> 03:21:45,930
I got to see Arcana Project and Shizuoka a little while ago.

1881
03:21:46,070 --> 03:21:46,470
It was pretty fun.

1882
03:21:46,550 --> 03:21:47,490
They're so great.

1883
03:21:47,630 --> 03:21:51,070
They're like a vocal powerhouse.

1884
03:21:52,870 --> 03:21:54,390
How do places like Deer Stage work?

1885
03:21:54,570 --> 03:21:56,610
You do just go there, get a ticket, and go inside.

1886
03:21:58,010 --> 03:22:05,710
I would first check the Twitter because some dates are
ticketed.

1887
03:22:05,730 --> 03:22:17,410
so you can't go but typically if it's like but there are
also special events where you can still just go but it like

1888
03:22:17,410 --> 03:22:24,370
on their Twitter on the deer stage Twitter it says like they
get they post a schedule for the week and it says if it's um

1889
03:22:24,370 --> 03:22:42,670
ticketed or not but but you can go you can go and uh
basically so the base there's three floors the base floor is

1890
03:22:42,670 --> 03:22:52,510
uh is the theater so you can pay a thousand yen just to
watch the show they do about three shows um a night the

1891
03:22:52,510 --> 03:22:58,630
second floor is a cafe um if there's no one if you want to
watch a show and there's no one around on the first floor go

1892
03:22:58,630 --> 03:23:07,290
to the second floor and say like oh you can either go and
stay at the cafe or you can be like i uh i um i want to

1893
03:23:07,290 --> 03:23:12,470
watch the show on the first floor and you can just pay your
thousand yen and then you can leave and come back too um so

1894
03:23:12,470 --> 03:23:20,390
if you're just like i'm gonna get gonna go and like get some
food at the convene across the street you can go do that um

1895
03:23:22,850 --> 03:23:34,570
but uh and then the third floor is the bar um and uh i
believe each each floor the um the cafe and the bar both

1896
03:23:34,570 --> 03:23:35,770
have service fees.

1897
03:23:37,210 --> 03:23:38,430
Oh, this is not butching.

1898
03:23:45,450 --> 03:23:49,570
Yeah, Starkabomb is right down the street too, so yeah.

1899
03:23:50,210 --> 03:23:52,090
Thank you for introducing me to all these Dempah songs.

1900
03:23:52,450 --> 03:23:54,150
Definitely keen to listen to more.

1901
03:23:54,630 --> 03:23:55,450
Amazing karaoke mint.

1902
03:23:56,330 --> 03:23:59,360
Sorry if I didn't do them justice, but...

1903
03:24:03,850 --> 03:24:05,290
I was part of...

1904
03:24:05,310 --> 03:24:08,370
a nine-man raid on Deer Stage before Fest.

1905
03:24:09,370 --> 03:24:12,430
We kind of overwhelmed the girls, but it was a great time.

1906
03:24:14,530 --> 03:24:16,550
Oh my gosh, you guys are crazy.

1907
03:24:17,990 --> 03:24:24,650
Yeah, when I've gone past a couple times, they're just like,
wow, there's so many more foreigners coming recently.

1908
03:24:25,130 --> 03:24:26,050
And I'm just like, really?

1909
03:24:26,730 --> 03:24:27,650
I wonder why.

1910
03:24:29,890 --> 03:24:30,930
I wonder why.

1911
03:24:33,790 --> 03:24:35,050
But it's great.

1912
03:24:35,310 --> 03:24:42,730
glad that more people are going to Deer Stage, especially
with Dempogumi disbanding, I'm really worried.

1913
03:24:43,650 --> 03:24:48,970
But they do have some other popular groups in collaboration
with another company called Perfect Music.

1914
03:24:49,190 --> 03:24:52,730
So right now you see like DSPM, it means Deer Stage Perfect
Music.

1915
03:24:54,770 --> 03:24:57,290
But I am still like kind of, I am a little worried.

1916
03:24:57,490 --> 03:25:02,070
I am like, I don't think any, you know, they survived the

1917
03:25:05,310 --> 03:25:06,510
I'm so grateful for that.

1918
03:25:07,450 --> 03:25:19,850
But I think it's like the perfect place to experience true
Akiba culture as it is now.

1919
03:25:20,990 --> 03:25:22,290
So, yeah.

1920
03:25:22,910 --> 03:25:23,390
Mirror!

1921
03:25:23,530 --> 03:25:24,270
Oh my gosh!

1922
03:25:24,370 --> 03:25:25,130
Welcome to membership!

1923
03:25:25,350 --> 03:25:26,130
Thank you!

1924
03:25:27,470 --> 03:25:29,350
Thank you so much!

1925
03:25:30,170 --> 03:25:31,110
I love all your art.

1926
03:25:31,210 --> 03:25:31,830
Thank you!

1927
03:25:35,310 --> 03:25:43,910
But I do, I've ordered, like, I haven't, I hadn't ordered
since, like, engaging had broken up.

1928
03:25:44,130 --> 03:25:46,510
I had stopped ordering a bunch of stuff.

1929
03:25:47,090 --> 03:25:52,970
But I ordered some Aonian stuff when she was in Dempagumi.

1930
03:25:53,210 --> 03:25:55,490
And I ordered some of her stuff, too.

1931
03:25:58,450 --> 03:26:02,530
As Arcana and other groups that I like.

1932
03:26:03,030 --> 03:26:03,890
So, mm-hmm.

1933
03:26:04,290 --> 03:26:04,650
Mm-hmm.

1934
03:26:11,710 --> 03:26:13,410
No, not this song.

1935
03:26:15,530 --> 03:26:18,430
But, um, yeah.

1936
03:26:22,730 --> 03:26:29,690
It's weird to, like, you know, be so sad when they've been
around for so long, but Aonian is very squished cheeks.

1937
03:26:31,110 --> 03:26:33,130
I really like Kyrushite from Deer Sage.

1938
03:26:33,470 --> 03:26:36,690
Yes, Kyrushite is one of their, like, really popular groups
right now.

1939
03:26:37,390 --> 03:26:40,070
So, Kyrushite is very popular.

1940
03:26:40,070 --> 03:26:48,470
so that's why i'm like not entirely worried but you know i
still want them to do well and um they like there's been

1941
03:26:48,470 --> 03:27:00,730
some groups that like formed and then disbanded shortly
after so you know just stuff like that not weird at all

1942
03:27:05,050 --> 03:27:14,290
i feel the onion fairies i hope we don't lose any more akiva
culture Yeah.

1943
03:27:16,050 --> 03:27:16,730
Yeah.

1944
03:27:17,310 --> 03:27:22,910
Especially, you know, Tempo really kept the Akiba culture
alive for me.

1945
03:27:27,320 --> 03:27:28,280
It's not dying.

1946
03:27:29,680 --> 03:27:30,340
It's not dead.

1947
03:27:32,040 --> 03:27:34,880
You know, Tempo's legacy will be around, so.

1948
03:27:48,230 --> 03:28:08,870
I think I have like some other like more personal things
about them just banning too this is like very much end of a

1949
03:28:08,870 --> 03:28:26,310
era I had a friend that she and I loved Dumpa together and
you know she She was not a ghost and unfortunately she

1950
03:28:26,310 --> 03:28:39,730
passed away last year and so I kind of will be thinking of
her and everything.

1951
03:28:40,430 --> 03:28:48,930
So I thought of her a lot with the disbandment.

1952
03:29:07,790 --> 03:29:08,830
But, um...

1953
03:29:08,830 --> 03:29:09,550
This was fun!

1954
03:29:10,470 --> 03:29:12,310

03:33:41,430 --> 03:33:42,190
Don't worry!

2016
03:33:52,450 --> 03:33:54,290
Your Steam is not set to show adult games.

2019
03:33:58,710 --> 03:33:59,470

And, um...

2026
03:34:12,650 --> 03:34:14,470

2027
03:34:14,950 --> 03:34:17,170
Friday, we're going to do a tour of Akihabara.

2028

general, I'll show you some places that I go to and

03:34:28,390 --> 03:34:28,890
frequent.

2031
03:34:29,250 --> 03:34:31,030
And, well, not frequent, but, you know.

2032
03:34:34,370 --> 03:34:36,570
So, we'll do an Aki-ba tour on Friday.

2034
