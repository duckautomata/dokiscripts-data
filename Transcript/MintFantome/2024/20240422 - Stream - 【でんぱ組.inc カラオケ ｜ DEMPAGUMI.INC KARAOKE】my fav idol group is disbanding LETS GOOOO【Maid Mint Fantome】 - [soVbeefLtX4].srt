1
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,020
Oh, gosh.

2
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,700
Oh, maybe doing a karaoke was a mistake, but it's okay.

3
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,080
Whatever.

4
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,900
My throat will heal eventually one day.

5
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,800
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

6
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,820
Welcome.

7
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,400
Welcome to my sad karaoke.

8
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,120
Because that was fun?

9
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,580
Thank you!

10
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,160
I've seen many groups and concerts, mostly 80 bands with my dad.

11
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,240
I enjoyed all of them, but I enjoyed last night the most.

12
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,640
Thank you for being electric.

13
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,560
Really?

14
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,720
Stop.

15
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,280
Stop.

16
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, last night I had a...

17
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,800
A little event.

18
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,880
Kusa Land.

19
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,780
It was like an Anikura thing.

20
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,360
Oh my gosh.

21
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,660
SPTK is like, let's go!

22
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,220
Let's go!

23
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,980
Thanks for the 10 gifts!

24
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,760
Thank you so much!

25
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,700
I won't be able to watch this live, but thank you for your service.

26
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,800
Spreading the word of Denpagumi.

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,780
Can you tell us about your favorite members?

28
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,440
My Oshis.

29
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,800
Oshi is Ria P. Ria P. P.

30
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,540
Can't wait for more mincing.

31
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,660
I had a great time at Kusa Land.

32
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,320
You did awesome.

33
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,240
Thank you.

34
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,500
Oh my gosh.

35
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,560
So many people were there.

36
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,900
So cute.

37
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,880
I saw the picture of you guys.

38
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,440
So cute.

39
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,040
So yeah, we gather here in honor of my favorite idol group of all time.

40
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,900
Who announced their disbandment yesterday.

41
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,920
Denpagumi Inc.

42
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,240
TV table tray.

43
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,600
Thank you for the 10 gifts and thank you!

44
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,660
Denpagumi Inc.

45
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,260
is like...

46
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,300
They have been my life force.

47
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,600
Maybe that's the reason why I'm a ghost.

48
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,400
Because I have to stick around.

49
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,180
I can't go to heaven.

50
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,260
Because I...

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,080
I can't move on.

52
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,820
I can't move on.

53
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,940
Maybe I don't want to go to heaven.

54
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,880
I can't move on because I...

55
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,220
Because I just want to stay with Denpagumi.

56
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,740
I'm really hoping this doesn't affect Rito-kun too much.

57
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,480
She'll be around in Tokyo but I worry.

58
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,540
I think she'll be okay.

59
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,920
King Chrono!

60
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,900
Thank you for the 5 gifts!

61
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,620
I...

62
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,220
I...

63
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,720
Uh...

64
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,920
Started as...

65
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,780
So...

66
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,180
Just to give you guys a background of some Denpagumi stuff.

67
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,000
Scorpio, thank you for the 10 gifts.

68
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,600
Um...

69
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,660
They came...

70
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,880
They come from a cafe in Akihabara called Deer Stage.

71
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,120
Which I love Deer Stage sooooo much!

72
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,780
Love Deer Stage sooooo much!

73
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,420
Which is a...

74
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,540
It's an idol cafe and bar.

75
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,900
And they do performances and stuff.

76
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,000
Almost daily.

77
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,940
And...

78
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,440
Um...

79
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,340
It's like...

80
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,500
Kind of legendary in Akihabara.

81
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,620
Especially because...

82
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,540
Um...

83
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,180
You know...

84
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,740
Denpagumi came from there.

85
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,780
And Denpagumi is...

86
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,480
Such a beloved idol group.

87
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:57,980
Like...

88
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,880
There are probably some idols that...

89
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,500
Would not be idols if it were for...

90
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,720
Weren't for Denpagumi.

91
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,780
Like...

92
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,540
I have pictures of Ano.

93
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,600
You know Ano from...

94
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,340
Uh...

95
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,000
She did the Chainsaw Man ending.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,200
Kikikero kikikero kerochu.

97
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,080
She has...

98
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,420
She loves like Nemu...

99
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,660
Yumemi Nemu.

100
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,680
Which was my Oshii.

101
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,600
Um...

102
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,280
Like she has pictures with Nemu.

103
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:21,760
Like...

104
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,360
There are idols who...

105
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,360
Who...

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,660
Like...

107
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,140
Became...

108
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,180
Like...

109
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,600
Mini versions of Denpagumi members.

110
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,080
Um...

111
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,740
So they are trendsetters.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,700
There are so much more than that!

113
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,940
They're like...

114
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,880
I don't know.

115
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,160
They've...

116
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,780
They...

117
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,840
They just have such an impact on the...

118
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,820
On...

119
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,480
Not just...

120
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,800
I wouldn't even just say the idol world.

121
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,640
I would say the...

122
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,040
Entertainment industry in Japan as a whole.

123
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
Have a fun stream Minto!

124
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,460
We'll definitely watch the VOD but now it's sleep before work.

125
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,280
Good luck with...

126
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,840
Work!

127
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,080
Um...

128
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,840
I wonder if Mint wouldn't be so Minty without Deerstage.

129
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,340
I don't think so.

130
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,020
Because...

131
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,080
Um...

132
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,880
My Oshii Yumemi Nemu...

133
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,260
She was the Mint member...

134
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,060
Of...

135
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,600
The group.

136
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,020
Kikikero kikikero kerochu.

137
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,720
She is the reason why I became...

138
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,900
To love the color Mint so much in general.

139
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,040
So...

140
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,740
I also like Nemukyun.

141
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,220
I love it!

142
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,840
Kamiyoshi...

143
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,280
My Kamiyoshi is Nemukyun.

144
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,460
Always Nemukyun.

145
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,640
Yeah.

146
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,360
So...

147
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,840
Um...

148
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,000
A lot of...

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Even what I do...

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,060
Is always been influenced by Denpagumi.

151
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,460
And...

152
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,520
Um...

153
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,720
Just the way that I love idols...

154
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,000
And the way that I love Akihabara...

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,720
Has been influenced by Denpagumi.

156
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,540
So I truly...

157
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,420
I truly...

158
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:42,720
Like...

159
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,100
It's not an exaggeration...

160
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,640
When I say that I wouldn't be...

161
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,220
The ghost that I am...

162
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,960
Today...

163
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,520
If it wasn't for them.

164
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,120
So...

165
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,000
Um...

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,060
You know...

167
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,780
It's...

168
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,660
So awesome.

169
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,240
Moga is my Oshii.

170
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,300
Yeah...

171
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,300
Mogami Moga.

172
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,120
Um...

173
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,340
I know.

174
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,520
Um...

175
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:06,660
Um...

176
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,340
I know.

177
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:08,980
I know.

178
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,580
I get it.

179
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,800
They are super important to you.

180
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,180
Yeah.

181
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,600
They are like the most important to me ever.

182
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,260
And so...

183
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,640
Uh...

184
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,660
I know that we have...

185
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,800
Or I still have some time with them.

186
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,100
But...

187
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,260
I wanted to do this karaoke kind of early.

188
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,100
Because I was like...

189
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,640
Maybe if I get you guys into Denpagumi too...

190
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,380
Um...

191
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,420
If you...

192
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,260
Go to Japan...

193
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:30,900
And...

194
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,280
You have a chance to see them.

195
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,740
Maybe you'll be able to see them.

196
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,200
And...

197
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,720
Um...

198
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,200
I think...

199
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,540
Everybody should experience a Denpagumi concert.

200
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,960
At least once in their life.

201
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,300
It's so awesome.

202
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,140
Like...

203
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,460
Their fans are so great.

204
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,100
Um...

205
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,460
There's one member...

206
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,720
Furukawa Mirin.

207
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,680
Who...

208
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,640
Has...

209
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,740
Gotten...

210
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,300
I would...

211
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,220
I'm not gonna say infamous.

212
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,240
Because it's not that at all.

213
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,740
But she...

214
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,020
Uh...

215
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,360
Went...

216
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
She got...

217
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,860
She went viral...

218
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,360
For...

219
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,380
Being...

220
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,080
A...

221
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,960
Married...

222
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,660
Idol...

223
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,140
And she had a kid...

224
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,620
Uh...

225
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,560
Not so long ago.

226
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,760
Well...

227
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,720
How long ago?

228
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,280
A couple...

229
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,480
Maybe a couple years...

230
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,220
Two years ago?

231
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,400
Which is still...

232
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,460
That's still new.

233
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,020
That's still a new baby.

234
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,020
So...

235
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,420
Yeah...

236
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,740
Oh...

237
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,580
Hi...

238
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,860
I really love Denpagumi.

239
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,580
I'm so sad to see they're disbanding me too.

240
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,380
Like...

241
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,740
I have...

242
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,580
So many...

243
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:29,800
Like...

244
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,920
If I go into my closet...

245
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,840
Half of my t-shirts are Denpagumi.

246
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,140
Um...

247
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,720
I have like...

248
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,860
Happy Coats of Denpa.

249
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,680
I have...

250
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,740
I have a whole...

251
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:38,940
I have a whole...

252
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,500
Like...

253
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,100
I only own one Ita bag.

254
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,840
And it's all Denpagumi themed.

255
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,560
So...

256
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,040
But...

257
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,380
Um...

258
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,740
We've had them around for a really long time.

259
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,760
16 years.

260
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,680
So...

261
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,600
Um...

262
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,820
Super duper grateful that...

263
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,220
Um...

264
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,060
And you know...

265
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,260
The sad truth of it is that...

266
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,500
In recent years...

267
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,560
They haven't been so popular.

268
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,440
Uh...

269
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,920
They started out as a group...

270
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,320
A duo...

271
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,700
This is like going way, way back.

272
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,140
But they started out as like...

273
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,780
Um...

274
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:08,920
You know...

275
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,240
As just...

276
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,980
Uh...

277
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,360
A duo.

278
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,380
And then they added more people in to be a five member group.

279
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,920
Which is what a lot of people...

280
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,680
Um...

281
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,400
Kind of...

282
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
I wouldn't say like the star...

283
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,440
But like...

284
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,100
The beginning of the star...

285
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,920
Of like...

286
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,100
The big Denpa era.

287
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,200
Um...

288
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,380
Then one of the members left.

289
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,400
Her name was Miyu.

290
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,840
And they added two other members.

291
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,100
Pinky...

292
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,040
And...

293
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,340
Moga.

294
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,680
Um...

295
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,000
And they became a group of six.

296
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,280
And um...

297
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,540
From there...

298
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:38,900
Like...

299
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,400
That was...

300
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,600
That was like...

301
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,380
The group...

302
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,320
That a lot of people really like...

303
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,640
Consider the golden era of Denpogumi.

304
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,260
Even though...

305
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,000
I love...

306
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,400
All of Denpogumi.

307
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,620
Mizutama Online OGs...

308
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:51,920
Yes!

309
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,120
They weren't even named Denpogumi at the time.

310
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,120
Um...

311
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,820
And they...

312
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,440
Were...

313
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,740
Created...

314
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,380
By...

315
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,140
Um...

316
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,900
Mofuku-chan.

317
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,760
Who...

318
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,160
Um...

319
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,140
Works at Deer Stage.

320
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,560
Which...

321
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't know if anybody...

322
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,880
Recognizes them.

323
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,840
But if you do...

324
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,320
She actually...

325
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,800
Works as...

326
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,720
One of the...

327
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,280
J.P.

328
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,080
Staff...

329
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,340
In V-shojo.

330
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,280
So...

331
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,960
Um...

332
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I remember when V-shojo announced that...

333
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,820
I was like...

334
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,480
I was like...

335
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,840
Mofuku-chan?

336
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,680
I was like...

337
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,180
No way!

338
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,540
So...

339
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,480
Yeah...

340
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,700
It's super...

341
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,540
So...

342
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:34,960
I...

343
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,600
It was like...

344
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,000
I was like...

345
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,420
No way.

346
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:38,860
Um...

347
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,380
This is...

348
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,180
There's no way.

349
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:40,880
Like...

350
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,960
So I was super duper shocked about that.

351
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,740
Is that so?

352
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,760
Yeah!

353
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,560
Yes!

354
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,180
Yes!

355
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,380
Yes!

356
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:46,520
Yes!

357
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,740
So...

358
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,640
She technically works for...

359
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,020
Um...

360
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,820
V-shojo.

361
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,320
The world is so big and so small at the same time.

362
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,020
I know, right?

363
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,540
It was like the last thing...

364
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,360
I remember...

365
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,680
I...

366
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,260
Um...

367
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,220
I remember messaging...

368
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,420
Um...

369
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:00,760
Um...

370
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,960
A few of my friends who...

371
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,680
Uh...

372
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,180
They're not like super into...

373
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,140
Idol...

374
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,860
Not idols...

375
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,040
Um...

376
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,360
They're not super into Vtubers but they know Dempa and Deerstage and they were just like...

377
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,920
What?

378
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,420
What is this crossover?

379
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,360
But...

380
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,480
Um...

381
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,440
Mm...

382
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,720
And...

383
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,260
Uh...

384
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,000
So...

385
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,660
Um...

386
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,340
Uh...

387
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,880
What was it?

388
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,140
Um...

389
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,200
And that's not like secret news or anything.

390
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,160
They announced that.

391
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,170
But nobody...

392
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,880
I think people...

393
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,920
Didn't really know who she was.

394
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,160
So it kind of was like a...

395
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,740
Oh...

396
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,300
Some...

397
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,020
Some lady...

398
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,560
Joined...

399
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,640
Bishoujo Japan.

400
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,580
Yeah...

401
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:41,840
Yeah...

402
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,200
Yeah...

403
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,680
And so...

404
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,160
Um...

405
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,660
Yeah...

406
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,780
There was the Golden Era.

407
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,940
You have like the six of them.

408
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,760
They have songs that like...

409
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,300
Uh...

410
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,120
One thing that...

411
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,380
Or rather...

412
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:52,620
Here...

413
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,220
Let me finish my thought.

414
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,700
They have songs about like...

415
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:54,960
You know...

416
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Being the six of them.

417
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,680
Things like that.

418
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,140
And...

419
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,440
Um...

420
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,640
One thing that like really makes them stand out from...

421
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,720
Uh...

422
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,120
Other idols is that they...

423
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,880
They're all like otaku girls.

424
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,000
Like...

425
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,200
They're all like...

426
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,960
You know...

427
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:08,920
Um...

428
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,980
It's so cute.

429
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,400
Mirin made a post...

430
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,040
Um...

431
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,420
She's like considered the leader.

432
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,160
She made a post...

433
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,220
Um...

434
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,800
Uh...

435
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:17,920
Recently...

436
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,400
You know...

437
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
Because of all of this.

438
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,440
Just being like...

439
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,920
I became an idol to...

440
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,260
To...

441
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,500
Like...

442
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,040
Get back at the people that said that I couldn't do it.

443
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,760
All the bullies.

444
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,180
Cause she...

445
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,860
Like...

446
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,140
She dropped out of high school and everything.

447
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,640
Like...

448
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:30,980
She...

449
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,200
Um...

450
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,220
And you know...

451
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,120
There was like...

452
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,080
It's just a...

453
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,980
It's like a kind of group of girls that you wouldn't...

454
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,120
Expect to be idols.

455
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,140
Who all...

456
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,020
Um...

457
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,700
Who all just became...

458
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,640
Shining stars.

459
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,620
And they're so sweet.

460
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,160
And so...

461
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,940
So great.

462
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,560
And...

463
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,800
I love all of them.

464
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,420
So...

465
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,080
Yeah.

466
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,900
Um...

467
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,860
So...

468
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,320
They're super duper awesome.

469
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,860
I only bought my...

470
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,760
My...

471
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,400
Um...

472
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,300
What's the word?

473
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,920
My...

474
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,580
Joy sound pass for...

475
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,040
For...

476
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,660
What?

477
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,620
For three hours.

478
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,860
And...

479
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,320
Denpugumi has many songs.

480
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:05,960
Um...

481
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,740
Not that I'm gonna sing all of them obviously.

482
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,260
Just...

483
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:08,940
You know...

484
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,460
Um...

485
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,300
The ones that I want to today.

486
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,420
Where the heck is...

487
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,100
Te...

488
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,380
Te...

489
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:14,640
Te...

490
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh...

491
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,420
Uh...

492
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:15,800
Te...

493
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,080
Te...

494
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,200
Te...

495
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,500
Te...

496
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,040
Te...

497
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,080
Te...

498
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,500
Te...

499
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:17,900
Te...

500
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:17,940
Te...

501
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,000
Te...

502
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,400
Te...

503
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,200
I have my one Uchiwa that says Daisuki.

504
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,600
And my other Uchiwa that says Totoi.

505
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,700
Which means Daisuki, I love you.

506
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,920
And Totoi is like precious.

507
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,600
My precious group.

508
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,080
My favorite group ever.

509
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,740
Um...

510
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,880
So...

511
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,900
Let's see...

512
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,160
Um...

513
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,140
Where is my...

514
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,580
Oh there we go.

515
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,160
Den...

516
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,900
Um...

517
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,980
I think I'm gonna have to type in the group name every time.

518
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,840
Which kind of...

519
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,720
Sucks.

520
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,940
Because it's gonna take me a second.

521
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,100
Den...

522
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,580
Pa...

523
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:04,980
Gumi...

524
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,520
Ink...

525
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,660
I'm gonna start with a warm-up song.

526
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:12,780
Um...

527
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,340
Oh my gosh.

528
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,000
They have so...

529
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,280
The...

530
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,720
On Joy Sound here, they have 102 songs.

531
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,640
So...

532
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,700
Honestly...

533
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,340
I could...

534
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,480
Sing...

535
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,340
I think it's...

536
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,240
It feels like almost their whole discography.

537
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,080
Um...

538
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,420
Um...

539
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,800
They have so many.

540
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,940
And I'll be honest.

541
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,160
I'm probably going to sing more of the older songs.

542
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,340
Because...

543
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:32,820
Um...

544
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,660
Uh...

545
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,120
It's what I know best.

546
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,580
Um...

547
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,200
Uh...

548
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,600
By older, I mean like...

549
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,300
Um...

550
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,460
I don't know.

551
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,760
I don't know actually what is considered older anymore.

552
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,200
Um...

553
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,080
Future Diver.

554
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,420
I don't know if that's a warm-up song.

555
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,700
And I also apologize again about my voice.

556
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,400
Because...

557
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,040
Um...

558
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,060
I don't know.

559
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,180
Um...

560
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,460
I...

561
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,400
I...

562
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:56,860
This...

563
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,260
Like I said.

564
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,400
Karaoke might be a mistake.

565
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,180
But...

566
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,960
Whatever.

567
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,040
I want to sing.

568
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,000
Denpa Gumi.

569
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:03,980
Um...

570
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,460
You're so freaking cute.

571
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,240
I can't deal.

572
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,060
What do you mean?

573
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:11,860
Um...

574
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,480
A lot of their songs are very like high energy.

575
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,600
There's like a whole genre called Denpa Music.

576
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,920
Which like...

577
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,940
Is very high energy.

578
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,640
Like...

579
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:22,820
Fun.

580
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,280
I don't even...

581
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,640
Like...

582
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,420
I'm bad at describing things.

583
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,420
But...

584
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:27,620
Um...

585
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,480
They're very high energy.

586
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,200
Akiba Pop.

587
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,060
They have lots of songs about Akiba.

588
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,320
They love Akiba too.

589
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,500
So...

590
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,220
Yeah.

591
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,460
Okay.

592
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,200
I'm going to sing this one.

593
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,940
Which is actually one of their more serious songs.

594
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,360
But...

595
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,340
I'm going to sing it to kind of warm up my throat a little bit.

596
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,120
I was just recording with Matara doing...

597
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,420
Um...

598
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,620
A...

599
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,020
A...

600
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:55,780
A...

601
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,100
A...

602
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,360
A...

603
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,420
A...

604
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,420
For the podcast.

605
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,680
Um...

606
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,700
And we talked for...

607
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,420
Of course longer than we expected to.

608
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,240
So...

609
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,940
Um...

610
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,420
Yeah.

611
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,540
Actually...

612
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,100
No.

613
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,240
I'm going to save this one for later.

614
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,040
Because I will cry.

615
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,120
Okay.

616
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,420
This one is called Brand New World.

617
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,640
It is a bit more of a serious song.

618
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:14,940
But...

619
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,060
They have some pretty cool...

620
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,520
Actually...

621
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,200
No.

622
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:17,720
You know what?

623
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,780
I'm going to do Phantom of the Truth.

624
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,620
Because it is also...

625
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,660
It's a really cool song.

626
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,340
They did a...

627
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:23,780
Um...

628
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,160
They did a collab with a game called Phantom of the Kill.

629
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,300
Which I...

630
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,260
Uh...

631
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,620
Or no.

632
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,340
Phantom of Kill?

633
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,280
Anyway.

634
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,600
They were...

635
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,660
They were featured as characters in the game.

636
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,000
And this is the song from that.

637
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,740
And it's really cool.

638
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,840
And I...

639
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,580
Think it might be better...

640
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,640
Just try singing it than the other one.

641
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:44,940
Okay.

642
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,360
You know what?

643
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,300
I only have three hours.

644
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,480
That might pass.

645
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,180
And I started it at six.

646
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,960
So I already wasted twenty minutes, you guys.

647
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,260
Okay.

648
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,440
Let me know if the...

649
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,680
Let me know if the...

650
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,160
If the audio is okay.

651
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:23,070
I just killed the phantom Of my soul I just killed the phantom Of my heart I just killed the phantom Of myself I'm, I'm, I'm I'm the only one I just killed the phantom of my life

652
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,900
Oh my gosh, the timing is a little off.

653
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,360
Even if I make a small mistake, I will make everything stronger.

654
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,320
I will make a small mistake stronger.

655
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,620
I just killed the phantom of my heart.

656
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,060
I just killed the phantom of myself.

657
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,020
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm the only one.

658
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,080
I'm just touching it.

659
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,260
I have the same intention.

660
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,520
I don't hesitate to do things like that.

661
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,500
Two things in one.

662
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,200
All

663
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,780
the sounds are fading away.

664
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,760
Your warmth won't reach me.

665
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,780
Yeah, warm up.

666
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,220
The flame in me is starting to burn.

667
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,340
Please stop my heart.

668
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,580
Going out of control now.

669
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,360
The words that won't disappear will always be there.

670
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,400
From that day on, you will always support me.

671
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,940
I don't know about this or that.

672
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,060
I keep repeating myself.

673
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,320
Go and meet the real me.

674
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,740
I will meet you someday.

675
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,280
Where will

676
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,920
I go after this?

677
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,240
No one knows.

678
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,160
I don't know.

679
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,320
I keep going around.

680
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,340
I don't care if I'm not the person I wanted to be.

681
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,080
I'm turning it into hope.

682
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,000
Now, I'm shouting in my heart.

683
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,240
The real me I call to the truth.

684
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,920
My heartbeat is getting hotter and hotter.

685
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,280
I'm hurt to live.

686
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,060
Even so, I keep moving forward.

687
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,000
I won't look away again.

688
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,740
I'll grab onto that hand.

689
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:51,230
I just killed the phantom of my heart.

690
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,210
I just killed the phantom...

691
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,900
Yay!

692
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,380
That was Phantom of the Kill.

693
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,200
Which is such a cool song and I just murdered it.

694
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,660
But that's okay.

695
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,320
Phantom of the...

696
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,680
The...

697
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:21,980
Kill...

698
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,460
Oh, no.

699
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,700
Truth.

700
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,180
Sorry.

701
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
I was mixing up.

702
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,420
Truth.

703
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,320
Phantom of the Truth.

704
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,440
Oh, it just totally went off.

705
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:31,800
Hold on.

706
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,160
There we go.

707
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,820
Yeah, warming up.

708
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,520
I think I put it in the pinned message.

709
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,540
But in case you're watching this later, I'm not going to do well on a lot of these songs.

710
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,000
Because a lot of them are made for six people.

711
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,480
And also...

712
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,720
Their range is like...

713
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,140
They can go from like very cool voices to very like cutesy and like...

714
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,820
And...

715
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,720
It doesn't...

716
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,300
It might not suit my voice entirely.

717
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,520
But we're just here to have fun.

718
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,900
So hopefully you like the songs.

719
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,060
And...

720
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,480
You just check them out yourself.

721
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,480
Because...

722
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,400
They have some...

723
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,320
They have such an incredible...

724
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,040
Oh, sorry.

725
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,500
Hold on.

726
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,620
I'm typing at the same time.

727
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,860
They have an incredible...

728
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,060
Discography.

729
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,880
They have so many different types of music.

730
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,360
Starting off good.

731
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,180
Time to clone yourself.

732
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,540
Yeah.

733
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,660
This next song, I know I can sing.

734
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,980
But it also makes me cry.

735
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,240
So...

736
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,380
My performance is about passion.

737
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,660
Not studio recording precision.

738
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,220
Okay.

739
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,120
Passion.

740
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,540
Passion.

741
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,160
Okay.

742
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:51,480
Passion.

743
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,260
Passion.

744
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,300
Passion.

745
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,620
Yeah.

746
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,040
Yeah.

747
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,140
Yeah.

748
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,320
Yeah.

749
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,560
Yeah.

750
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:57,960
Yeah.

751
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,020
Yeah.

752
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,160
Yeah.

753
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,880
This one though.

754
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,260
I think I can do.

755
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,420
This song.

756
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,340
This next one.

757
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,100
I might sing again later.

758
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,460
Because I just love it so much.

759
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,680
It might be actually my favorite Denpogumi song.

760
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,160
And I sing it every time I go to karaoke.

761
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,120
I sing a lot of their songs every time I go to karaoke.

762
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,420
I say a lot, but I'm not very...

763
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,080
Well, I do sing them, just not very well.

764
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,940
So, next one!

765
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
It's a slower song.

766
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,320
We did a cool song, now we'll do a slower song.

767
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,740
I'm gonna have to go get some more tea soon.

768
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm waiting for my... I was waiting for my water to load.

769
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,320
Not load.

770
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,240
Boil.

771
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,310
I'm waiting for my water to load.

772
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,330
I'm waiting for my water to load.

773
00:25:49,350 --> 00:26:08,850
I'm waiting for my water to load.

774
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:48,690
A little pause... and we are back.

775
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:13,290
A little pause... and we are back.

776
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,310
A little pause... and we are back.

777
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:49,310
A little pause... and we are back.

778
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,970
This song has me blushing!

779
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,950
This song has me blushing!

780
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,890
That

781
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,930
was Kuchitsuke Kibonu.

782
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,490
One of my favorite songs.

783
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,630
Actually, ever probably.

784
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,010
Let's see.

785
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,930
It's like kind of weird.

786
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,690
Kuchitsuke Kibonu.

787
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,290
Like that.

788
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:58,810
Kuchitsuke Kibonu.

789
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,390
That was so cute.

790
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,710
I didn't know it was a Denpokumi song.

791
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,370
Yeah!

792
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,610
It's so awesome.

793
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,310
Let me see.

794
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,990
If I click this and... well, let me search Denpokumi.

795
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,970
Oh, I can put them under my favorite artist.

796
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,750
Oh, I can put them under my favorite artist.

797
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,250
Wait, how do I search my favorite artist though?

798
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,230
Is there like a way?

799
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,150
Hmm...

800
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,650
This is ranking...

801
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,390
Sorry, I'm using Joyce.

802
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,310
Oh wait, maybe here.

803
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,550
Maybe under my name.

804
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,920
I can put them under my favorite but I can't search it?

805
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,860
Hmm... kind of weird.

806
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,320
Even when they're gone, they're still the ones you love.

807
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:48,720
Yeah.

808
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,600
So true.

809
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,280
Wait.

810
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,780
Oh, wait.

811
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,620
My room may be under here.

812
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,240
Oh, yes!

813
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,140
Okay, perfect.

814
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,840
Now I don't have to type them in every time.

815
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,380
I'm using tilt controls!

816
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,800
Oh my gosh, I don't know what else is... there's so many songs.

817
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,880
I'm just gonna go through and...

818
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,900
There's a lot of these though that I feel like I can sing...

819
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,760
better than other ones.

820
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,800
I think I'll just...

821
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,480
cry the whole time.

822
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,020
They have so many good like feel-good songs.

823
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,900
Actually, maybe I'll do this one.

824
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,640
Hold on...

825
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,500
I'm not... like a lot of these I've never sung before so it's...

826
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,280
I kind of always stick to the same ones but that's okay.

827
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,620
Wait, what's actually... no, I can't sing some of these because I'll just cry!

828
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,040
Okay, let's get through some of these without crying.

829
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
Orange Reum!

830
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,960
That's one of them!

831
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,240
I'll just cry!

832
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,660
I'll just cry.

833
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,000
WWD Best.

834
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,820
This one though, I tried... actually I sang this one at karaoke.

835
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,720
I tried singing it... last time I was in Japan.

836
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,140
I don't know if you guys noticed but in the lyrics of Kuchitsuke Kibo, which is the short name of Kuchitsuke Kibo.

837
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,620
They talk about... they sing about being an akiba and everything.

838
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,740
And this one... this song is also about akiba.

839
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,580
But I think if I sing it, I...

840
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,220
Okay, we gotta try it.

841
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,800
We just gotta get through this.

842
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,580
No, I'm gonna save it for later.

843
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,180
I can't, I can't, I can't.

844
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,560
I'm already tearing up.

845
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,860
I can already feel myself tearing up.

846
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,100
Do they have a WWD?

847
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,600
I feel like they should, right?

848
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,120
Oh, they do!

849
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,320
So, they have two songs.

850
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,440
WWD...

851
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,880
WWD 2.

852
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,060
And then WWD Best.

853
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,080
Which is the first one.

854
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,980
WWD is kind of like about how the girls met.

855
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,040
It's about how the lyrics are like...

856
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,620
We're starting from this small stage but one day we'll reach the world.

857
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,560
Oh, I forgot to do the intro.

858
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,680
Oh my gosh, I went to do this when I first started the stream.

859
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,140
Moe-kyun song wo sekai ni o todoke!

860
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,520
Denpagumi Incu desu!

861
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,000
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu!

862
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,600
So this is their like little catchphrase that they say.

863
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,120
That means basically spreading...

864
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,540
We're Denpagumi!

865
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,100
We're spreading Moe song... Moe-kyun songs all over the world!

866
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,980
And they do like this little thing with their hands and then they make their...

867
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,680
They make like an L shape with their hands and then they...

868
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,000
Put it above their heads.

869
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,300
Yeah.

870
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,540
Sorry, I guess maybe I should show you guys what songs I'm looking at, right?

871
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,120
No, maybe it's better to...

872
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,960
Keep it secret.

873
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,440
I don't know.

874
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,460
But yeah, WWD is about like how they came to be.

875
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,500
WWD 2 is like a little more dramatic.

876
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,720
It's about like how each girl kind of doubts themselves.

877
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:18,460
But together as Denpagumi, they are so powerful and great.

878
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,720
And then WWD Best was the last...

879
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,440
Version of the song.

880
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,720
And that was right before...

881
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,080
The member MOGA.

882
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,660
She left from the six that I talked about earlier.

883
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:37,240
Cryingwugfan.com Yeah.

884
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,800
And...

885
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,600
And...

886
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,300
So...

887
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,340
You know...

888
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,820
After MOGA left...

889
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,620
Because you know, you have WWD, you have WWD 2.

890
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,100
In the songs, they like...

891
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,120
Mention each other's names.

892
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,620
After MOGA left, they kind of weren't really able to perform these songs anymore.

893
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,340
They eventually did get two other members.

894
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,220
Nemotonagi.

895
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,640
Who is also a member of another idol group I really like.

896
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,740
Nijin no Konkistador.

897
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,280
And Perorin.

898
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,120
She was...

899
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,260
She's an artist.

900
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,680
She does a lot of like...

901
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,200
Idol...

902
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,100
Otaku art and stuff like that.

903
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,380
And...

904
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,180
Not Botchinatsu is my fave.

905
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,900
Nemu is so cute.

906
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,340
I know!

907
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,020
Oh my gosh, I love the...

908
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,440
I love the remixes of it.

909
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,280
I listen to them...

910
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,840
Quite often.

911
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,200
They're fun.

912
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,380
But yeah, so they added them.

913
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,380
After that...

914
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,160
The group...

915
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,100
After...

916
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,360
They were added, they were...

917
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,700
A group of...

918
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,400
What?

919
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,380
Seven.

920
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,880
Se...

921
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,180
Seven people for a while.

922
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,940
Then, Mai Kami Oshi...

923
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,600
Um...

924
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,420
Yumemi Nemu.

925
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,260
She announced graduation.

926
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,880
And then...

927
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,740
Um...

928
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,020
Not so long after that...

929
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,080
Another member...

930
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,900
Eitaso...

931
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,460
Um...

932
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,500
Naruse Eimi.

933
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,120
Her nickname is Eitaso.

934
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,480
She...

935
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,420
Announced graduation.

936
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,760
Um...

937
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,280
You might recognize her because she...

938
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,580
Um...

939
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,880
Actually voiced a...

940
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,500
A Precure.

941
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,440
Um...

942
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,460
Which was one of her dreams.

943
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,240
And it came true.

944
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,280
I'm so happy for her!

945
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:12,900
Um...

946
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,800
But uh...

947
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,040
After that...

948
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,420
Um...

949
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,320
They added a bunch of new people.

950
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,480
Um...

951
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,780
Uh...

952
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,260
And...

953
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,610
Um...

954
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,000
The group kind of...

955
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,360
Became a little bit more turbulent.

956
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,060
Um...

957
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,720
With more...

958
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,160
More and more members leaving.

959
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,380
Um...

960
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,400
Uh...

961
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,480
So...

962
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,080
It's understandable that...

963
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,540
Um...

964
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,260
That...

965
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:36,620
You know...

966
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,600
They're ending...

967
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,640
Especially with some of the...

968
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,320
Core members also...

969
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,260
Uh...

970
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,600
Also...

971
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,100
You know...

972
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,780
Getting older...

973
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,120
And...

974
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,820
Starting families even.

975
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,580
So...

976
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,660
Hmm...

977
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,300
Um...

978
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,420
But...

979
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,300
They've always been...

980
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,080
So awesome.

981
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,300
I'm gonna try singing WWD too.

982
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,720
But...

983
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,120
You're going to quickly realize why this song is very difficult to sing.

984
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,140
Especially...

985
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,900
As...

986
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,100
One person.

987
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,020
And...

988
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,700
It also has different languages in it.

989
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,180
So...

990
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,960
Um...

991
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,340
Uh...

992
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,600
If I get them wrong...

993
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:07,620
Sorry.

994
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:08,740
Okay.

995
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,940
Actually, you know what?

996
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,320
Hold on.

997
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,560
I'm gonna show the screen for this one.

998
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,600
Wait.

999
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,040
Where is it?

1000
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,820
Here we go.

1001
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:32,860

1113
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,220
学校なんか行きたくなかった ネットがでかし...

1114
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:12,380
A little pause... and we are back.

1115
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,400
A little pause...

1116
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,400
and we are back.

1117
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:07,380
A little pause... and we are back.

1118
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:52,060
A little pause... and we are back.

1119
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:57,780
Yeah!

1120
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:05,710
Yeah!

1121
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,310
My voice is like...

1122
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:14,130
My voice is like... not suited to sing this right now but it's okay.

1123
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,650
That was WWD.

1124
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:17,970
Next!

1125
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,490
Of course we have to do...

1126
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,650
Of course we have to do... WWD 2!

1127
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:24,270
WWD 2!

1128
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,530
That song is so crazy.

1129
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:28,390
That song is so crazy.

1130
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:28,510
That song is the best song ever.

1131
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,190
Makes me feel so emotional.

1132
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:33,270
I mean maybe for people who don't...

1133
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:34,950
I mean maybe for people who don't...

1134
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:35,910
know Dempa so well.

1135
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,990
But you can kind of feel the passion from it, right?

1136
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,350
And that's why Dempa Gumi was so powerful.

1137
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,310
And amazing.

1138
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:45,290
Just kind of like...

1139
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,310
You had this group of girls who were like...

1140
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,150
I was depressed.

1141
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,110
I didn't know what I was doing with my life.

1142
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,010
I only...

1143
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:52,250
I only...

1144
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,910
kind of realized the reason I was born.

1145
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,450
Because of...

1146
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,510
Because of you know...

1147
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,910
doing this.

1148
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,790
They found their passion and their calling.

1149
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:06,830
WWD 2!

1150
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,660
Oh I should get more tea after this song.

1151
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,940
Don't let me forget.

1152
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,600
But wait if I do...

1153
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,820
up to date.

1154
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,720
die.

1155
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,480
I

1156
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,240
won't go.

1157
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,440
That was my goal.

1158
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,480
I amů chapter two.

1159
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:02,940
After.

1160
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,280
number.

1161
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,140
One done.

1162
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,700
So.

1163
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,480
I don't know this one as well.

1164
00:45:47,080 --> 00:46:05,080
I don't know this one as well.

1165
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,680
I don't know this one as well.

1166
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:35,660
I don't know this one as well.

1167
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,480
I'm sorry to cry.

1168
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:15,920
I'm sorry to cry.

1169
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:26,380
Is it necessary for me?

1170
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,280
Is it necessary for me?

1171
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,460
Is it necessary for me?

1172
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,140
Is it necessary for me?

1173
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,640
Shut up!

1174
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,440
Stop it already!

1175
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,480
Why are you all running around?

1176
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,400
I don't care if it's just a date.

1177
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,240
I don't care if it's just a fight.

1178
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,940
I don't want to run away anymore.

1179
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,240
Because there are only six of us.

1180
00:47:53,940 --> 00:48:00,500
I'm sure, I'm sure that no one will lose.

1181
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,160
I'm not being cocky.

1182
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,340
I don't want to face people and the test.

1183
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,940
I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to.

1184
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:10,880
I don't care.

1185
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,780
But now it's 1 for all.

1186
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,580
All for one.

1187
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,580
I can't stop here.

1188
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,380
The red line is sticking out.

1189
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,800
But I'm not confident.

1190
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,580
I'm not being cocky.

1191
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,840
White line.

1192
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,660
Why can't I say anything?

1193
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,450
I have to be more firm.

1194
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:45,110
Yellow, I want to shine on everyone.

1195
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,070
But it's all in the past.

1196
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,110
Oh my god, my...

1197
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:49,270
I can't notice the tip of my boat.

1198
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,710
Why can't I notice it?

1199
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,130
Blue alone.

1200
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:55,350
Blue alone.

1201
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:56,270
I'm overflowing with tears.

1202
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,310
Well...

1203
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,610
Sorry, my voice is so bad.

1204
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:06,890
Oh, people rated.

1205
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:07,770
Hello, thank you.

1206
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:14,350
I'm singing badly today.

1207
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,480
1 for all.

1208
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,040
All for one.

1209
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,720
1 for all.

1210
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,320
All for you.

1211
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,200
1 for all.

1212
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,680
All for fans.

1213
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,500
1 for all.

1214
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,080
All for dream.

1215
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,920
1 for all.

1216
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,560
It's

1217
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,400
okay if it's a good thing.

1218
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,360
It's okay if it's a bad thing.

1219
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,260
I'm alone for everyone.

1220
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,960
Everyone is for one person.

1221
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,640
And let's send love all over the world.

1222
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,680
Ah, let's go.

1223
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:13,740
Meaning.

1224
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,400
Lisa.

1225
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,350
That was W.

1226
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:03,590
W...

1227
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:04,470
W...

1228
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,110
Oh, D.

1229
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:06,430
2.

1230
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:10,010
And the part in the middle when they're just like...

1231
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,310
I wonder if it's necessary.

1232
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,470
It's like each girl says it one at a time.

1233
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,250
And all the fans are just like...

1234
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,010
Because, you know, they're basically saying...

1235
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:18,390
Am I...

1236
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,070
Am I needed?

1237
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,190
You know, like, am I...

1238
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:21,950
Am I important?

1239
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:22,850
And everyone's like...

1240
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:23,910
Yeah, you're so important.

1241
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:25,130
Yeah.

1242
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:26,370
Did you see us yelling?

1243
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:26,850
I did.

1244
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:29,090
I did.

1245
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:29,550
I did.

1246
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:29,890
I did.

1247
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:30,710
Yeah.

1248
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,110
So they're all just like...

1249
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,770
It's a song about being just kind of like...

1250
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:37,850
Oh, I realized also earlier.

1251
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:40,270
I think I said meeting was the leader, but she's the center.

1252
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:41,970
Risa is the white member.

1253
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:42,910
She's the leader.

1254
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:43,650
So I...

1255
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:44,470
I meant...

1256
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,350
I'm in my brain.

1257
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,370
I knew center, but I said leader on accident.

1258
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:48,030
But yeah.

1259
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:49,790
So...

1260
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:55,470
So, yeah, like, they're all just kind of talking about how they don't have any confidence.

1261
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,570
And they are just like...

1262
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:58,430
We don't...

1263
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:00,270
We don't know if we're doing a good job.

1264
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:02,790
But with us together, we're doing a good job.

1265
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:07,830
And we can, you know, we can spread our Dempa power all over the world.

1266
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,050
Get that tea.

1267
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:09,530
I will.

1268
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:10,250
I'll be right back.

1269
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:11,250
Let me go get my tea.

1270
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:12,650
My...

1271
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:14,070
I'm so sorry for my throat.

1272
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,550
I can't do high notes at all right now.

1273
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:17,310
I probably...

1274
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,690
Like I said, I know I keep repeating myself.

1275
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:22,130
I shouldn't be doing this karaoke, but I don't care.

1276
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,190
I don't care.

1277
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:26,170
Okay.

1278
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:26,670
I'll be right back.

1279
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:15,530
I'm back.

1280
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:16,450
I'm back.

1281
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:18,410
I'm back.

1282
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:19,530
Oh, I should have gotten a spoon.

1283
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,010
I should have gotten a spoon.

1284
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:24,890
I have, like, this...

1285
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:25,950
You know, like, the...

1286
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,310
The, like, honey loquat stuff?

1287
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:32,610
That's really good for your throat.

1288
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:35,590
I forgot I had that.

1289
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,910
But I'm drinking throat tea right now.

1290
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:38,490
So...

1291
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:39,650
You know what?

1292
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,270
Maybe I can just suck on this.

1293
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:43,830
Where's the opening?

1294
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:46,430
It would help if I could.

1295
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:47,670
I totally forgot I took these fans out of my hand.

1296
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:48,590
But I'm also...

1297
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:51,710
A ghost.

1298
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,320
Mmmmm.

1299
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,240
Yummy.

1300
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:06,880
Okay.

1301
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:07,900
Oh...

1302
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,740
Oh, there we go.

1303
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,620
All right.

1304
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,960
I don't know if I can do WWB.

1305
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,540
Or WWD-Best right now.

1306
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,500
I don't know if I can do it.

1307
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,420
A lot of these songs will just make me cry.

1308
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:23,600
I don't know.

1309
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,120
Thank you very much!

1310
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,600
Thank you!

1311
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:08,540
Thank you very much!

1312
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:56,880
Thank you very much!

1313
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,460
Thank you very much!

1314
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:06,060
Also, tell me if you prefer seeing the lyrics or not.

1315
00:56:55,510 --> 00:57:01,450
A little pause... and we are back.

1316
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:20,010
A little pause... and we are back.

1317
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:27,550
Wait, is that the part where it goes, Honto?

1318
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:28,270
Dayo ne?

1319
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:30,270
Or is it, Honto dayo ne?

1320
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:32,390
Can't remember.

1321
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:36,830
La la la, la la la la la la.

1322
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:37,730
Shibuya!

1323
00:57:38,870 --> 00:58:07,050
Yane wo hasiru konoko no you ni boku wa kiseki wo matte ita yoru Wa bura tsuki aruiteita Subete o hiraku kagi ga mitsukaru Sonna hi wo sagashiteita kedo Nante tanjun de baka na ore Ah, machi wa fukaku Bokura wo itaku

1324
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:14,650
Tsuyoi kimochi Tsuyoi ai

1325
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:40,030
Wait, they say this part over.

1326
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:43,430
Stand up, dance, and dance in the middle of joy.

1327
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:46,110
Dance in the middle of

1328
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:56,650
joy.

1329
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,200
Dance in the street, baby, yeah!

1330
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:19,290
It's under the skyscraper building that was lit up warmly.

1331
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:22,410
Look, it's dawn in a blink of an eye.

1332
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:27,270
Beautiful sky, echoing blue sky.

1333
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:28,750
Days that no one has ever seen.

1334
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,950
I hold them tight in my chest.

1335
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:33,990
I want to engrave them in my heart.

1336
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:35,830
Ah, the city is deep.

1337
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:37,810
I want to walk.

1338
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:43,270
Strong feelings.

1339
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:45,130
Strong love.

1340
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:47,230
My heart is also tightly connected.

1341
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:51,190
Many sorrows remain.

1342
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,450
We offer each other.

1343
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:56,030
These feelings right now.

1344
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:59,790
Strongly, strongly, strongly.

1345
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:03,650
The evening sun rises.

1346
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,590
Days of life are going on.

1347
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:12,450
A big, deep river passes between you and me.

1348
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:18,950
As the tears fall, I keep sp��ing my cheeks.

1349
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:21,990
A strong wind has become cold.

1350
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,850
You and I laugh.

1351
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,090
These feelings right now.

1352
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,530
It's true, isn't it?

1353
01:00:48,780 --> 01:01:02,710
A little pause... and we are back.

1354
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:13,630
A little pause... and we are back.

1355
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,330
Oh, sorry.

1356
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,010
Sorry if you're finding out from me.

1357
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:21,290
I'm so sorry.

1358
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:22,370
It's okay.

1359
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:23,430
You can do this again when it's better.

1360
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:24,290
Yeah, exactly.

1361
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:33,270
I think I can maybe do this one if I...

1362
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:36,890
This song I might have to put on... like get Romaji lyrics for, for real.

1363
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,910
I want to do Precious Summer, Evergreen.

1364
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,330
I might cry at this one.

1365
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,870
Today's fandom are Mintogumi.

1366
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:46,350
Yeah!

1367
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:50,510
I'm so happy to hear Mintogumi singing.

1368
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:54,490
Thank you!

1369
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:56,070
I'm happy too.

1370
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:58,790
Precious Summer kills me so much.

1371
01:01:58,810 --> 01:01:59,290
Me too.

1372
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:01,810
Me too.

1373
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:04,810
Precious Summer.

1374
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:07,950
This is our last summer with Denpa.

1375
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:12,990
Oh gosh, I can't.

1376
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,770
I can't think about it.

1377
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:16,250
I can't think about it too much.

1378
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:18,630
I just have to think about me having...

1379
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:21,910
I just have to think about me...

1380
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:27,190
Just thinking about this as a normal karaoke stream.

1381
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:30,430
Okay, Future Diver.

1382
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:35,850
This is like probably I would say their most popular song.

1383
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:38,390
The calls in it are so much fun.

1384
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:43,310
I recommend 100% looking up a video of them performing it.

1385
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:44,810
So you could see.

1386
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:48,950
Just how much fun the whole thing is.

1387
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:51,450
It's so awesome.

1388
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:56,270
Yeah.

1389
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:59,010
It's Mintogumi's turn.

1390
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:03,390
But this song is also very hard.

1391
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,410
So I'm not going to sing it well.

1392
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:05,370
Just a warning.

1393
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,030
Let's go!

1394
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:11,190
Let's go!

1395
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:14,240
Let's go!

1396
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,760
Diver, Dermagumi Inc's Future Diver!

1397
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:42,180

1398
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:12,140
A little pause... and we are back.

1399
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,160
A little pause...

1400
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:42,160
and we are back.

1401
01:04:42,180 --> 01:05:12,160
A little pause... and we are back.

1402
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:41,560
A little pause... and we are back.

1403
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:09,200
A little pause... and we are back.

1404
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,720
A little pause... and we are back.

1405
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:17,490
Yes!

1406
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:17,850
If you say Yes!

1407
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:18,650
Say Yes!

1408
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:19,670
Dive!

1409
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:19,990
Dive!

1410
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:20,250
Dive!

1411
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:20,450
If you say Yes!

1412
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:21,310
Say Yes!

1413
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:22,250
Dive!

1414
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:22,570
Dive!

1415
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:22,770
Dive!

1416
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:23,230
Into me!

1417
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:23,890
Into you!

1418
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:24,870
Dive!

1419
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:25,370
Dive!

1420
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:25,850
Into me!

1421
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:26,410
Into you!

1422
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:27,430
Dive!

1423
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:28,030
Dive!

1424
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:29,390
Dive dive dive dive dive dive dive!

1425
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:31,830
Dreams won't end.

1426
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:33,430
Yes!

1427
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:36,350
Your future-time is full of dreams.

1428
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,270
Swim into it.

1429
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,010
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo!

1430
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:42,830
No!

1431
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:43,790
You can't!

1432
01:06:54,750 --> 01:07:13,770
A little pause...

1433
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:13,770
and we are back.

1434
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:33,310
A little pause... and we are back.

1435
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:43,930
Here we go.

1436
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:51,370
I started reaching for my tea, so I like...

1437
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:55,230
So I completely forgot.

1438
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:01,490
During like the beginning parts, when it's like...

1439
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:05,790
The calls you do are just like...

1440
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:10,250
You say the member's name, so it's like...

1441
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:12,830
Miri no mabushi ni hayo hai!

1442
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:24,870
I actually, I'll be honest, I don't know the calls for the new girls.

1443
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:26,110
Because I don't know...

1444
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:30,070
I don't know who sings which part anymore.

1445
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:31,810
I just remember the original.

1446
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,730
I like how many switch ups they have in their songs, it's fun.

1447
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:37,190
Yes!

1448
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:41,970
That's one thing about them, is that they are just...

1449
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:43,770
Their energy is unmatched.

1450
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:47,770
Their songs like, take you on a journey.

1451
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:48,650
It's so fun.

1452
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,430
You can tell they are hard.

1453
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:51,230
You are doing great.

1454
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:52,130
Thank you!

1455
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,450
Thank you!

1456
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:57,310
I'll have to do a revengeance when I'm...

1457
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:59,290
When my throat is eventually healed.

1458
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:03,710
This will be my last karaoke for a long time.

1459
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:11,030
Yeah, let's do one that's not so straining for me right now.

1460
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,200
Um...

1461
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:18,340
Um...

1462
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:19,940
There was...

1463
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:20,760
What was I...

1464
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:21,640
There was one song.

1465
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:22,000
I think...

1466
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,300
Did I...

1467
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,200
Oh wait, I forgot to add it.

1468
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:23,720
Sorry, my bad.

1469
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:24,700
Future Diver.

1470
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,000
Future Diver.

1471
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,240
Um...

1472
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:37,830
This song is...

1473
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:40,770
It's not her graduation song.

1474
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:45,130
Actually, Evergreen, I believe, is what she said would be her graduation song.

1475
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:48,310
But my kami oshi yume minemu...

1476
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:49,490
When she sings this song...

1477
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:49,770
When she sings this song...

1478
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:50,550
At her final live.

1479
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:54,090
I kind of, in my heart, consider this as her graduation song.

1480
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:56,690
Sorry Nemu.

1481
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:59,650
Even though whatever my Oshii says is justice.

1482
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:05,630
Take care of yourself, I understand.

1483
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:06,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1484
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:16,890
But this one, I think, is just very special to me.

1485
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,150
So I'm going to try and sing it.

1486
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:20,750
Yeah.

1487
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:27,790
I hope I don't.

1488
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:08,720
Oh my gosh, I've never sung this before.

1489
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,420
I've never sung this before because I always thought that I would just cry.

1490
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,740
Now I just know that I can't sing it.

1491
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,610
Everyone loves me.

1492
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:43,210
I guess I'm going to try to sing over right now.

1493
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:45,450
She's actually really focused in singing that part.

1494
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:45,950
easiest part, she's even more!

1495
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:46,250
Sver rimerik.

1496
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:49,710
Maybe they thought you'd sing it already?

1497
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:52,690
Send her status so proof of that!

1498
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:53,150
I'm showing you that I'm a virgin!

1499
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:56,850
Maybe she knew this was aわかりanger.

1500
01:13:58,530 --> 01:13:59,350
Come on girl!

1501
01:13:59,490 --> 01:13:59,650
Girl, high five!

1502
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:56,060
Yay!

1503
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:03,440
Hold

1504
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:08,530
on, let me respond to...

1505
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:10,010
Okay.

1506
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:14,570
Okay, that was...

1507
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:17,170
One second, okay.

1508
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,580
Did you sing Sakura Operation already?

1509
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:41,460
I have not, because it's not on the setlist yet.

1510
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:42,900
Or rather...

1511
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:45,640
It's not written, so I have not sung it yet.

1512
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,460
Welcome though, welcome.

1513
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:51,500
This song made me so happy.

1514
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,980
It's such a sweet song.

1515
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,820
It's so cute.

1516
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,480
Like I said, I can't sing a lot of their songs well.

1517
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:58,960
Because I mostly just listen to them.

1518
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,240
But...

1519
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,000
But yeah.

1520
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:05,940
They have such cute songs.

1521
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,100
And fun songs.

1522
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,080
Do I...

1523
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,940
I'm gonna try singing this one.

1524
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,060
It's kind of another...

1525
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:19,940
They have a bunch of really fun songs.

1526
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:22,740
Chururi, chururira.

1527
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,280
I won't be singing because...

1528
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:25,500
It's...

1529
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,520
So fast.

1530
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,280
Then Parade maybe I can do.

1531
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:30,860
Sabotage!

1532
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:34,480
Notobochi.

1533
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,520
Minto being a part of the idol group too.

1534
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:40,520
They just don't know it yet.

1535
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,020
I...

1536
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:53,210
It's funny because like...

1537
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:55,110
I mean, if you had asked me...

1538
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:56,530
Years ago...

1539
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:58,050
If I wanted to be an idol...

1540
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:59,010
I think...

1541
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:00,090
No, not I think.

1542
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:00,590
I know.

1543
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:02,750
100% I would have been like...

1544
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:03,250
Yes, yes!

1545
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:04,590
I want to be an idol!

1546
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:05,390
I want to be an idol!

1547
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:06,710
But...

1548
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:09,370
I don't know so much now.

1549
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:12,430
I almost wanted to say...

1550
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:13,330
If you wanted to die, try...

1551
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,410
Chururi, chururira.

1552
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:15,190
But LOL.

1553
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:19,170
I don't know so much now.

1554
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:20,970
If I want to be an idol...

1555
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:22,430
Um...

1556
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:25,090
I think that...

1557
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:28,150
One thing I...

1558
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:31,430
One thing that...

1559
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:33,850
You know...

1560
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:34,390
There's one...

1561
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:36,070
Obviously...

1562
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:36,670
Hold on.

1563
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:38,150
Let me gather my words.

1564
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:40,210
When you...

1565
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,990
Are a fan of something...

1566
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:44,950
It can be natural to...

1567
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:47,030
Also want to be a part of that thing, you know?

1568
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:47,650
Like...

1569
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:48,950
You know...

1570
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:50,150
If you want to...

1571
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,370
If you're a fan of idols...

1572
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:53,330
You want to be an idol.

1573
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:54,950
Um...

1574
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:56,670
But to me...

1575
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:58,650
I think...

1576
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:00,190
Um...

1577
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:03,850
I think...

1578
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:07,890
I think...

1579
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:09,030
You should...

1580
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:10,270
Honestly...

1581
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:12,050
If you have those feelings as well...

1582
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:13,110
You should...

1583
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:14,530
You should...

1584
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:17,810
Cherish the feeling of being a fan more.

1585
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:20,930
Because...

1586
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:21,830
You know...

1587
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:22,530
Say you...

1588
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:24,530
Say you...

1589
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:24,940
Join...

1590
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:27,370
Say you...

1591
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:28,770
Become...

1592
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,810
What you love...

1593
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:31,870
And be...

1594
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:32,970
Say that...

1595
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:34,470
What you love...

1596
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:36,630
Is not what you expected...

1597
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:37,830
And...

1598
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:38,690
You know...

1599
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:40,190
What you...

1600
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:41,830
The thing...

1601
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:42,310
You know...

1602
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:43,570
Maybe things are...

1603
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:44,510
Not as...

1604
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:46,430
Good as you thought it would be...

1605
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:47,010
Maybe...

1606
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:48,870
You join an idol group and...

1607
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:49,770
Um...

1608
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:50,810
You're just like...

1609
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:50,910
Hold on...

1610
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:50,990
Oh...

1611
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:51,390
I loved...

1612
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:52,310
I loved seeing...

1613
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,430
My favorite idols...

1614
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:55,650
Um...

1615
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:57,850
Being so cute together on stage...

1616
01:18:57,850 --> 01:18:59,150
I bet they're the bestest of friends...

1617
01:18:59,150 --> 01:18:59,970
And then you join...

1618
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:00,970
And...

1619
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:02,810
Maybe they...

1620
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:04,330
They don't like each other...

1621
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:05,430
Maybe they don't talk...

1622
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:08,610
Maybe it's just the complete opposite of what you imagined...

1623
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:09,610
Maybe...

1624
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:10,770
Maybe...

1625
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:12,190
The manager is...

1626
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:12,970
Like...

1627
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:13,510
A...

1628
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:14,630
Poopy guy...

1629
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:15,970
Maybe...

1630
01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:16,930
Um...

1631
01:19:16,930 --> 01:19:17,930
Just...

1632
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:18,530
You know...

1633
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:19,350
Once you learn...

1634
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:19,730
The...

1635
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:20,810
Ends of something...

1636
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:20,890
Um...

1637
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,970
It's...

1638
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:22,590
You know...

1639
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:23,630
If you...

1640
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:25,830
If you...

1641
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:26,670
You know...

1642
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:28,150
It's much harder to...

1643
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:29,030
Uh...

1644
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:32,250
Go back to being a fan...

1645
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:35,290
And you'll never have that opportunity again...

1646
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:36,970
I'm not...

1647
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:37,970
Usually one to say...

1648
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:38,990
Don't meet your heroes...

1649
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:40,430
Because every time I've met my hero...

1650
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:40,850
I've...

1651
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:41,230
I've...

1652
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:42,150
You know...

1653
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,230
Been very happy...

1654
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:43,650
But...

1655
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:46,530
But you'll never have that opportunity...

1656
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:48,070
You'll never have that love again...

1657
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:48,590
If...

1658
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:50,270
The thing that you...

1659
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:50,870
Loved...

1660
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:51,410
Once...

1661
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:52,930
You know...

1662
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:54,070
Turns into resentment...

1663
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:54,790
You can never...

1664
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,570
You can never take that back...

1665
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:58,990
So please cherish being a fan...

1666
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:01,970
If you can...

1667
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:02,670
You know?

1668
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:05,390
So...

1669
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:06,550
That's all I...

1670
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:08,650
Wanted to say about that...

1671
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:13,550
Let's see...

1672
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:14,710
Um...

1673
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:18,780
Oh...

1674
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:19,880
I was gonna do this one before...

1675
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:20,920
But I can do it now...

1676
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:21,680
Actually...

1677
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,120
Oh...

1678
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:22,600
I'm sorry...

1679
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,520
I was gonna say...

1680
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:24,860
I was gonna...

1681
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,080
Do a couple other songs...

1682
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:26,920
From that album...

1683
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:27,300
But...

1684
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:27,800
Like...

1685
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,840
There were some songs...

1686
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,320
That like...

1687
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:29,880
From Denpa...

1688
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,920
That really...

1689
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,160
Like...

1690
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,700
When I was so down...

1691
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:34,740
They really saved me...

1692
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:35,180
So...

1693
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:36,440
I...

1694
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:37,960
I don't think I can sing them at all though...

1695
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:38,380
Because I...

1696
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,120
Definitely...

1697
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,380
Will cry...

1698
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:41,420
What?

1699
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,120
Is this a hit song medley?

1700
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:44,140
Like...

1701
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:44,860
This is one of them...

1702
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,040
This is one of the songs...

1703
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:47,520
And this one...

1704
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,040
Kibono...

1705
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:49,220
Uh...

1706
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:50,580
Uh...

1707
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:51,460
Uh...

1708
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,000
Let's see...

1709
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,420
But we can do Brand New World...

1710
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:57,720
This one's a little bit more serious...

1711
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:57,900
So...

1712
01:20:58,860 --> 01:20:59,620
A little cooler...

1713
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:03,380
More simply...

1714
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:05,660
I feel like people don't need to turn their hobbies into a career...

1715
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:06,120
Sometimes...

1716
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,700
Just having the hobby to yourself is more satisfying...

1717
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:08,380
Yeah...

1718
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:09,040
Of course...

1719
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:11,380
I mean...

1720
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:12,280
There's always the what ifs...

1721
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:12,660
But...

1722
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,320
I mean...

1723
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,220
What if you...

1724
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:16,100
What if...

1725
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,900
What if it ruins the whole experience for you?

1726
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,960
That's the part that scares me the most...

1727
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,160
What if...

1728
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:24,940
What if...

1729
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:37,100
If I ever throw away my love...

1730
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,580
That's the only reason that I can do it...

1731
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,360
One more time...

1732
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:40,160
Please don't leave...

1733
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,400
It was reallyiser than I thought...

1734
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,540
I feel like I'm playing Groove Coaster with this background...

1735
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:43,700
Haha!

1736
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,840
Hear the music...

1737
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,020
The same vitamin Q effect...

1738
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:50,500
To be smooth...

1739
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,820
Hold these wirklich clarinas...

1740
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:54,160
Let's see what else...

1741
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:59,420
What kind of future did you aim for?

1742
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:12,540
The drawing of a dream is certainly here.

1743
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:18,940
I'm so anxious that I can't go back to those days.

1744
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:23,060
The spiral of my heart is falling.

1745
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,940
We are running aimlessly.

1746
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,700
Seeking the light of dawn.

1747
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:38,360
Because the sky has always continued.

1748
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:42,180
I can't help but cry.

1749
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:47,060
I said goodbye to you.

1750
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:48,340
I was scared.

1751
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:54,700
Will we ever become stronger than now?

1752
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:05,230
I was waiting all the time.

1753
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:08,590
Just looking.

1754
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:16,310
What kind of wish did you make?

1755
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:48,420
A little pause... and we are back.

1756
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:17,240
A little

1757
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,240
pause...

1758
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:25,740
and we are back.

1759
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:55,720
A little pause... and we are back.

1760
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:21,320
A little

1761
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:28,190
pause...

1762
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:29,110
and we are back.

1763
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:16,960
A little pause... and we are back.

1764
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:17,660
An hour and a half...

1765
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:18,140
Oh!

1766
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,240
My brain kept thinking two hours.

1767
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,240
Oh my gosh, you're right.

1768
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:23,640
You're right.

1769
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:24,260
I kept thinking...

1770
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:25,640
For some reason, I was like, oh my gosh.

1771
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:27,920
I only have until eight.

1772
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,020
I'll never forget what it felt like to scream the word bust.

1773
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:37,580
It makes me feel good at my oshi in a room full of wits.

1774
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:38,600
I'll cherish yesterday.

1775
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:39,540
Thank you for being there.

1776
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:40,580
Thank you, Ray.

1777
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:43,720
That's so awesome.

1778
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:44,520
Thank you.

1779
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,040
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

1780
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:48,680
Thank you.

1781
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:49,500
Thank you.

1782
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:54,740
Well, I might...

1783
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,460
For... What's that?

1784
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:56,680
Nine?

1785
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:58,880
The pass on my...

1786
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,240
I only got a JoySound pass for three hours.

1787
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:02,760
So, I won't be able to...

1788
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:05,060
I won't be able to sing anymore.

1789
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,740
Unless I pay for like another hour.

1790
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,480
Which I don't know if I have enough.

1791
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:10,900
I might have to buy another card.

1792
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:11,900
Oh!

1793
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:12,460
No, no, no.

1794
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:12,860
Go away.

1795
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:16,910
Yeah, yeah.

1796
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:19,090
So, it's not that I have anything.

1797
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,320
Maybe I will try Sakura.

1798
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:29,900
Apparition.

1799
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:34,980
Even though I don't think I'm gonna be able to sing this song very well.

1800
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:39,000
I will try Sakura Apparition.

1801
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:44,540
The music video for this one is maybe my favorite Dempa music video.

1802
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,460
It's so...

1803
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,220
The way that it's made is so cute.

1804
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,360
It's so fun.

1805
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,200
It's just...

1806
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,960
It's so creative.

1807
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:51,660
I love it.

1808
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:52,120
Hey, Ren.

1809
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:52,980
Thank you for the five gifted.

1810
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:53,580
Thank you.

1811
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:57,600
Hey, yo.

1812
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,100
T E M P A from...

1813
01:27:59,100 --> 01:27:59,700
T E M P A from...

1814
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:00,440
Is PURPLE Bay Area!

1815
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,500
You'll see a lot of their songs always talk about Akihabara, but it's so great.

1816
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,660
I love Sakura Apparition.

1817
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,400
I love their songs, too!

1818
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,380
Meh, Meh, Meh...

1819
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:19,640
Yeah!

1820
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:32,110
Hey, yo!

1821
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:34,710
T E M P A from Akihabara to everywhere!

1822
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:35,190
마.

1823
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:37,490
Mu And we don't love anything anymore.

1824
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:38,950
・ い Ay .

1825
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:40,830
And sweet things!

1826
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:44,810
・ an ・ ne We are back from last year's soccer game.

1827
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:58,730
A little pause...

1828
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:09,530
and we are back.

1829
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,140
They are like singing over each other in this song.

1830
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:20,740
It's so fast.

1831
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:17,620
When they perform this song, they sometimes have, like, sakura petals coming from the stage and everything.

1832
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,680
And we all have this same dance move.

1833
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:07,740
It's so cool!

1834
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:22,760
I'm

1835
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:44,330
very excited!

1836
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:47,530
Throat can reach that note right now.

1837
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,350
Oh, whoops, wrong way.

1838
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:50,430
There we go.

1839
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:54,070
Bye bye sa- Maybe I should have said that for last, right?

1840
01:32:55,210 --> 01:33:00,030
Bye bye sayonara sakura appellation.

1841
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:02,990
Definitely check out the music video for that one.

1842
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:06,050
It's such a- Their songs are just so fun!

1843
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:09,290
Like, their shows are just a whole big party.

1844
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:10,230
It's so great.

1845
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,930
They're the bestest girls ever.

1846
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:20,930
I do wonder how Churururururu would be like.

1847
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:23,170
Also, this one's really great too.

1848
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:24,830
I've never sung it.

1849
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:26,430
A lot of these, like I said, I've never sung before.

1850
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:28,730
But...

1851
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:33,590
If they played that at their last show ever, I think they will.

1852
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:36,070
It's one of their really popular songs.

1853
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:38,070
What album do you recommend?

1854
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:42,150
They have like a WWD best album.

1855
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:48,830
Which has a lot of their popular- It doesn't have any- It doesn't have anything of their newest stuff, but it does have like their older, classic stuff.

1856
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:50,290
Have you seen them live often?

1857
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:51,170
Not often.

1858
01:33:51,470 --> 01:33:52,390
I've seen them...

1859
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:56,250
I can count how many times I've seen them live on one hand, probably.

1860
01:34:02,910 --> 01:34:10,350
When I liked them at my peak, I couldn't afford to go see them very often.

1861
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:11,050
So...

1862
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:12,170
Um...

1863
01:34:14,070 --> 01:34:14,490
Uh...

1864
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:16,130
And...

1865
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:20,690
Even still, it sometimes can be difficult to see them because of, uh...

1866
01:34:21,470 --> 01:34:27,630
Because sometimes like I can't get- Not that the tickets are selling out, but it's like hard to get them as like a foreigner, you know?

1867
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:31,670
What app are you using?

1868
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:32,110
Is it on the Switch?

1869
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:32,930
Yes, it's on the Switch!

1870
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:34,390
It's called the JoySound app.

1871
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:35,330
You have to, um...

1872
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:37,850
You have to have a Japanese account to get it though.

1873
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:41,030
What's the other one?

1874
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:41,430
Not...

1875
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:42,130
Not...

1876
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:42,330
Not...

1877
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:43,230
Not...

1878
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:44,250
Not...

1879
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:45,350
What's the other one?

1880
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:53,630
Maybe they don't have it...

1881
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:54,210
Wait...

1882
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:58,130
This one would make me cry.

1883
01:34:58,770 --> 01:35:00,450
I wonder how the medley is like.

1884
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:02,270
I love Kita Kita Ne.

1885
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:04,130
I love...

1886
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:06,090
I love all their songs.

1887
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:07,570
There's like not a song that...

1888
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:09,210
Oh, Akihabara-ife!

1889
01:35:13,890 --> 01:35:17,350
This one is really fun because the music video is in Akihabara.

1890
01:35:22,030 --> 01:35:24,730
I have to do WWD best at some point.

1891
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:27,050
Actually, this one is also Akihabara song.

1892
01:35:27,150 --> 01:35:28,690
This one is like a really slow song.

1893
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:30,250
It's probably the slowest song they have.

1894
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:33,230
But it's really pretty.

1895
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:34,910
In fact, I will sing it.

1896
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:37,610
I will sing it.

1897
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:43,430
They only release bangers.

1898
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:44,470
And they do, they do.

1899
01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:48,710
I'll sing Sabotage, don't worry.

1900
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:49,830
You don't have to pay me anything.

1901
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:51,840
I'll sing it.

1902
01:36:52,120 --> 01:37:04,940
"'Ketsuhito uwaari ga kita ra' Kitto hawa no mashiho de saigo ni

1903
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:19,240
Uranai wo yakusoku shiyou Suki, kirai, suki..."

1904
01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:00,090
Sorry!

1905
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:42,600
A little pause... and we are back.

1906
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,800
A little pause...

1907
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:49,800
and we are back.

1908
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:52,980
A little pause...

1909
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:52,980
and we are back.

1910
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:53,720
Oh my gosh.

1911
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:55,440
Sorry guys.

1912
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:00,060
Maybe too early to sing that one.

1913
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:06,920
Aki... Aki no... wait.

1914
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:12,340
Ha... no... hara... pa... de.

1915
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:15,860
It's kind of a... is it the other day?

1916
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:16,360
I'm not sure.

1917
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,480
Wait, let me double check it.

1918
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:26,420
Aki no hara no hara pa de.

1919
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:31,970
I haven't even gotten to the songs guys that will make me cry the most.

1920
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:40,830
I haven't even gotten to the songs that will make me cry the most.

1921
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:43,130
I haven't even touched Orange Room.

1922
01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:45,570
Or Kirakirachun.

1923
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:47,370
Oh gosh.

1924
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:50,470
No...

1925
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:50,870
Oh...

1926
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:54,550
Yeah, okay.

1927
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:56,510
Oh no.

1928
01:40:57,390 --> 01:40:58,350
Oh no, okay.

1929
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:00,850
Let's do...

1930
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:03,450
Let's do Den Den Passion.

1931
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:05,910
This one is also one that I'm going to mess up a lot.

1932
01:41:06,850 --> 01:41:07,790
But, that's okay.

1933
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:09,650
Actually, maybe I can get...

1934
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:17,250
Maybe I can get Aromaji for this one.

1935
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:19,710
Because I don't know otherwise if I'll be able to sing it.

1936
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:27,110
Because I don't know otherwise if I'll be able to sing it.

1937
01:41:27,110 --> 01:41:27,230
But I really just up -de 그거 if I do get My

1938
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,480
reading comprehension.

1939
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:35,180
My reading comprehension.

1940
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:37,540
Okay.

1941
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:37,920
Okay.

1942
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:38,760
Okay.

1943
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:39,880
The song is also Okay.

1944
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,940
The song is also a super duper popular song.

1945
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:42,100
A super duper popular song.

1946
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:44,120
When they do the dance for this...

1947
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:44,200
When they do the dance for this...

1948
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,040
They use ribbons.

1949
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:46,280
And it's so fun!

1950
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:46,780
And it's so fun!

1951
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:48,720
It like, they're spinning the ribbons all around.

1952
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:51,980
They even do Otagei with the ribbons And it's so much fun!

1953
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:52,480
And it's so much fun!

1954
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:53,400
I actually know it.

1955
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,040
I learned this dance.

1956
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:58,740
Maybe one day I can show you guys if I ever have a 3D model.

1957
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:07,660
Oh!

1958
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:08,580
There's MoFuku-chan!

1959
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:11,080
Who I mentioned earlier.

1960
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:22,480
Oh!

1961
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,000
My voice!

1962
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:24,320
Oh!

1963
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:28,660
My voice!

1964
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:06,020
Oh!

1965
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:20,140
My voice!

1966
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:25,840
Oh!

1967
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,000
My throat!

1968
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:31,180
I wonder if I'll be okay in the future.

1969
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,600
It's a tough world, isn't it?

1970
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:34,740
That's why I said this.

1971
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:35,520
It's okay!

1972
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:37,000
Everyone is gay and we're friends!

1973
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:38,480
Eita-san is doing well.

1974
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:39,040
Oh!

1975
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:39,580
It's about to start!

1976
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:40,920
Hey yo!

1977
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:42,440
Tempo check 1, 2!

1978
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:43,480
It's about to start!

1979
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:44,820
In the middle of a story!

1980
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:45,340
In the middle of the world!

1981
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:47,380
In the middle of the world!

1982
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:25,280
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1983
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,520
Keep moving forward!

1984
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:27,240
Oh!

1985
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:27,640
Let's get crazy!

1986
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:28,800
Oh!

1987
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:31,120
Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy!

1988
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:32,980
I'll do something!

1989
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:35,640
La la la la la!

1990
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:37,540
Yuki of the world!

1991
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:38,500
Da

1992
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,640
da da da da da da da!

1993
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,180
Da da da da da...

1994
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:04,360
No matter how much tea I drink my throat will never be prepared for that song!

1995
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:07,840
That was

1996
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:13,310
like...

1997
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:16,170
That was like Den-Den Passionless.

1998
01:46:25,890 --> 01:46:28,950
I'm going to take more of this honey stuff.

1999
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:40,830
You guys, I've been drinking this whole stream.

2000
01:46:41,650 --> 01:46:43,130
It's just that I got sick.

2001
01:46:43,890 --> 01:46:45,330
And it kind of messed up my throat.

2002
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:48,070
And it hasn't fully recovered.

2003
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:50,330
So...

2004
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:57,680
But also...

2005
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:58,680
Don't tell me I'm not doing this.

2006
01:46:58,680 --> 01:46:59,080
Tell me what to do.

2007
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:03,140
I don't need a bunch of people being like...

2008
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:04,360
Stop streaming!

2009
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:07,060
Don't sing anymore!

2010
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:09,080
I know my limits.

2011
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:09,580
Don't worry.

2012
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:15,260
Don't worry, don't worry.

2013
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:31,900
Right now I'm eating honey.

2014
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:33,400
It's like a...

2015
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:35,260
It's like a special honey throat thingy.

2016
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:38,020
Also, that song was just crazy.

2017
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:39,100
You can't breathe in it.

2018
01:47:39,580 --> 01:47:41,020
So I'm like trying to keep up.

2019
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,680
Again, songs meant for six people.

2020
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:55,840
My

2021
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:02,120
throat...

2022
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:03,840
And I know it sounds painful when I sing.

2023
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:05,880
But my throat doesn't hurt.

2024
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:07,220
It's just like raspy.

2025
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:09,160
It doesn't hurt me at all.

2026
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:11,220
It just can't hit the notes.

2027
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:14,360
So it's not like I'm hurting myself.

2028
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:15,880
Or anything like that.

2029
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:16,840
If you're just like, oh my god.

2030
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:18,900
No.

2031
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:22,540
It just isn't hitting the notes.

2032
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:23,020
As well.

2033
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:25,560
Yeah.

2034
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:30,140
Let's see.

2035
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,200
But I still have an hour.

2036
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:36,540
But I still have an hour.

2037
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:37,400
But I still have an hour.

2038
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:38,540
It's another song that I can do.

2039
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:39,460
Maybe...

2040
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:45,420
There's the other one though.

2041
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:46,060
Hold on.

2042
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:47,640
I'm gonna look it up.

2043
01:48:49,580 --> 01:48:50,100
Tempagumi.

2044
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,160
Tempagumi ink.

2045
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:57,560
Don't forget there's the ink at the end of their name.

2046
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,400
It's one of the song lyrics even.

2047
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:01,020
It's one of the song lyrics even.

2048
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:02,780
They're like...

2049
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:05,460
Don't forget the ink at the end of our name.

2050
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:09,280
I wonder if I could sing...

2051
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:10,460
Baby, baby.

2052
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:13,020
That one part at the end of Precious Summer.

2053
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:14,460
Baby, baby.

2054
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:16,340
Baby, baby.

2055
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:18,160
Na, na, na, na.

2056
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:19,660
Baby, baby.

2057
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:21,080
Oh, I got it.

2058
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:22,080
Honey, money.

2059
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:23,120
Oh, thank you.

2060
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:25,460
Thank you very much.

2061
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:29,220
Maybe, maybe.

2062
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:31,700
Na, na, na, na, na.

2063
01:49:32,780 --> 01:49:35,640
Actually, there is a song in here that I do want to sing.

2064
01:49:36,180 --> 01:49:36,800
Actually, there is a song in here that I do want to sing.

2065
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:37,160
Actually, there is a song in here that I do want to sing.

2066
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,760
Which I think I saw towards the top.

2067
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:41,860
And I was like, oh my god.

2068
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:43,100
They have this on here.

2069
01:49:46,950 --> 01:49:48,150
I saw it.

2070
01:49:48,230 --> 01:49:48,650
Hold on.

2071
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:49,990
Oh, wait.

2072
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:51,650
Is this the one that I want to...

2073
01:49:51,650 --> 01:49:51,870
Hold on.

2074
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:55,230
I don't know.

2075
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,260
I feel like I'm losing my brain.

2076
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:03,700
Hmm.

2077
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:09,120
Otsukaresama.

2078
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:11,720
That's another fun song.

2079
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,280
Because they use towels in the dance.

2080
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:15,640
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

2081
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:18,360
That one is also the rap part.

2082
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:19,980
I'll screw it up so bad.

2083
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:31,960
Can't get it at all.

2084
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:37,520
Oh, also, you guys may have heard Denpogumi before and didn't even realize.

2085
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:39,880
If you...

2086
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:41,300
Um...

2087
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:43,900
If you...

2088
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:46,520
Watch Saiki-ken.

2089
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:47,600
Okay, they did the openings.

2090
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:48,980
The opening songs.

2091
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:55,780
Yeah, so...

2092
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:58,120
They did those songs.

2093
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,440
Wait, where was it?

2094
01:51:01,540 --> 01:51:02,260
Oh, wait.

2095
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:02,520
No.

2096
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:03,280
No.

2097
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:08,360
Wait.

2098
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:13,400
Hmm.

2099
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:15,760
Hmm.

2100
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:18,440
I know I saw it under here though.

2101
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:19,760
I think actually...

2102
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:20,920
I think I need to search the keyword.

2103
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:23,440
Not artist.

2104
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:26,220
Yes.

2105
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:29,560
Because there's even more songs under searching as a keyword.

2106
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:32,240
There's so many Denpa songs.

2107
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:34,400
I mean, they've been around for 16 years, so...

2108
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,980
Of course there's gonna be a ton.

2109
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:38,760
I wonder if they have any of the old, old ones.

2110
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:40,200
Thank you!

2111
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:43,640
Thanks, Volge.

2112
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:46,640
I wonder if they have anyone's like magic mirror on here.

2113
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,940
No, but the magic of the magic will be beautiful.

2114
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:55,440
That's the secret magic of the mirror.

2115
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:56,300
Also!

2116
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,280
One of the members, Aizawa Risa.

2117
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:02,480
She is in another group called...

2118
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:08,680
Oh my gosh.

2119
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:09,980
She's in a duo.

2120
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:11,700
Someone help me, please.

2121
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:18,140
But in the duo, they did the endings for...

2122
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:18,580
Lavaleth!

2123
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:19,260
Yes, thank you.

2124
01:52:19,340 --> 01:52:19,920
Thank you, Thomas.

2125
01:52:21,140 --> 01:52:24,240
My brain kept saying Mia Regina, and I was like, that's not it.

2126
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:24,960
That's not correct.

2127
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:28,140
She's in a... yes, Lavaleth.

2128
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:31,480
They did the endings for the Aqua Taupe anime.

2129
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:34,120
So...

2130
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:35,820
Denpa is everywhere.

2131
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:37,500
Here we go.

2132
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:42,640
So this song is not specifically a Denpa Gumi song, but it is sung by my favorite...

2133
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:43,960
It's sung by my Kamiyoshi.

2134
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:45,200
Yumemi Nemu.

2135
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:46,260
And...

2136
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:50,140
It's actually one of the songs from her album.

2137
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:52,160
Her graduation album.

2138
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:53,280
So...

2139
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:58,640
I will try and sing it.

2140
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,700
I've never sung this one before either.

2141
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:01,280
Oh my gosh.

2142
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:06,100
I hope I do it justice for my Oshii.

2143
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:13,880
I didn't get to go to her graduation, but there was a...

2144
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:15,280
She did like a solo show.

2145
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:16,560
Well...

2146
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:19,640
It wasn't a solo show.

2147
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:21,340
It was like a...

2148
01:53:21,340 --> 01:53:23,380
She did like a celebration show.

2149
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,300
And I got to go see her there one more time.

2150
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:31,280
But I only got to see her twice, believe it or not.

2151
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:32,040
But I only got to see her twice, believe it or not.

2152
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:38,980
話したいことはいつも 話したいことはいつも うまく言葉にならない うまく言葉にならない

2153
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:55,200
あたしが泣いた夜も あたしが泣いた夜も 隣にいてくれたね 隣にいてくれたね これが最後の恋だと これが最後の恋だと どこかで決めてたのに どこかで決めてたのに

2154
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:14,300
誰にもいないこの部屋で 誰にもいないこの部屋で 壁に泊まれて眠る 壁に泊まれて眠る 喧嘩した日も 喧嘩した日も 怒った朝もあるけど 言葉がなくても

2155
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:44,360
The name of the song is called This is called my last love song.

2156
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:43,180
A little pause...

2157
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:43,180
and we are back.

2158
01:56:17,180 --> 01:56:18,580
A

2159
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:44,090
little pause...

2160
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:50,640
and we are back.

2161
01:56:53,360 --> 01:57:20,640
A little pause... and we are back.

2162
01:57:56,540 --> 01:58:02,440
This is called my last love song.

2163
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:35,780
You'll hear...

2164
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:47,100
Nemo has this really awesome version of it.

2165
01:58:48,860 --> 01:58:55,280
That actually was remixed by one of my favorite music producers ever, Panda Boy.

2166
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:03,480
I always remember it by the Japanese name because I'm a weeb, sorry.

2167
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:07,420
So...

2168
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:08,260
So...

2169
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:08,960
It's super...

2170
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:11,580
They played that in arcades when I was there.

2171
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:13,400
I assumed it was to make you sleepy and want to leave.

2172
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:15,840
Yeah.

2173
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:17,460
It's just...

2174
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:20,500
I don't know why they play it when things are ending.

2175
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:22,980
But it's like kind of...

2176
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:25,620
It's like bittersweet, you know?

2177
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:27,660
You hear it and you're just like, Aw, that was so fun.

2178
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,080
It's too bad that it has to end.

2179
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:30,760
I don't think they have it on here though.

2180
01:59:30,780 --> 01:59:32,420
Especially Nemo's version because...

2181
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:33,380
Actually, let me search.

2182
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:34,160
You met me, Nemo?

2183
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:36,480
Because there's a rap part in it.

2184
01:59:36,580 --> 01:59:37,460
And I've always wanted to try it.

2185
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:37,900
I've never been...

2186
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:38,940
I've never...

2187
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:43,000
I've never been able to sing it.

2188
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:44,420
Met me.

2189
01:59:48,230 --> 01:59:48,590
Net.

2190
01:59:50,430 --> 01:59:50,790
Oh!

2191
01:59:52,970 --> 01:59:53,330
Oh!

2192
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:54,610
I

2193
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:57,940
don't know.

2194
01:59:58,040 --> 01:59:59,000
Actually, I...

2195
01:59:59,000 --> 01:59:59,960
You met me, Nemo.

2196
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:01,160
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

2197
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:01,740
Ba-do-do-do-do.

2198
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:02,660
You met me, Nemo.

2199
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:03,800
I'm not going to do it today.

2200
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:04,280
No-no-no.

2201
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:04,740
No-no-no.

2202
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:05,520
No-no-no.

2203
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:06,780
Na-na-na-na.

2204
02:00:06,780 --> 02:00:07,820
This is her solo song.

2205
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:09,420
They each have solo songs too.

2206
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:10,080
So it's fun.

2207
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,760
Do they have Nia Peen on here?

2208
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:13,440
Sorry.

2209
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:13,520
Sorry.

2210
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:14,540
Now I'm going down a rabbit hole.

2211
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:16,500
Nia.

2212
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:25,480
Maybe...

2213
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:27,060
I think it's a small...

2214
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:30,340
Nia.

2215
02:00:36,570 --> 02:00:37,030
No!

2216
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:40,570
Panda Boy did the whole Nia Peen album.

2217
02:00:40,790 --> 02:00:41,610
Nia Peen is a...

2218
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:42,210
is a...

2219
02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:43,650
duo idol group.

2220
02:00:43,910 --> 02:00:45,190
They're now disbanded.

2221
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:45,750
But it was...

2222
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:48,010
one of the members of Dempagumi, Pinky.

2223
02:00:48,110 --> 02:00:49,330
And another member of...

2224
02:00:50,010 --> 02:00:52,650
Dempagumi used to have a sister group called Moso Calibration.

2225
02:00:53,530 --> 02:01:01,830
And so the two of them, a member from Nia from Moso Calibration and Pinky from Dempagumi, made this little group.

2226
02:01:01,990 --> 02:01:08,110
And it's kind of a play on words because Nia Peen, Nier Pin, they were a golf themed group.

2227
02:01:09,250 --> 02:01:15,290
And Nia Peen is close to Nier... like the term for golf.

2228
02:01:15,610 --> 02:01:16,850
So it's kind of cute.

2229
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:19,910
And all their songs are like...

2230
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:21,870
They have one song called Nice Shot.

2231
02:01:21,990 --> 02:01:22,570
It's so fun.

2232
02:01:22,910 --> 02:01:25,250
All their songs are so great because they're Panda Boy.

2233
02:01:27,950 --> 02:01:28,430
Yeah.

2234
02:01:29,250 --> 02:01:30,050
Why golf?

2235
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:30,830
I don't know.

2236
02:01:31,370 --> 02:01:32,370
I have no idea.

2237
02:01:32,490 --> 02:01:33,770
I don't know if they play golf or anything.

2238
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:36,790
I think it's Nia Peen.

2239
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:37,890
No, it's not.

2240
02:01:39,270 --> 02:01:39,750
Sorry.

2241
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:43,350
It's...

2242
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:44,410
Here, hold on.

2243
02:01:44,570 --> 02:01:45,870
Let me see if I can...

2244
02:01:52,230 --> 02:01:52,850
Oh my...

2245
02:01:52,850 --> 02:01:53,470
Yeah, yeah.

2246
02:01:53,550 --> 02:01:54,970
I was like, oh my gosh, wait, you're right.

2247
02:01:55,030 --> 02:01:55,510
No, that's...

2248
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:55,990
I read it wrong.

2249
02:01:56,070 --> 02:01:56,930
No, it's a small...

2250
02:01:56,930 --> 02:01:57,610
It's a small...

2251
02:01:58,430 --> 02:01:59,150
Nia Peen.

2252
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:04,570
Sorry to just call you wrong, but...

2253
02:02:07,290 --> 02:02:08,630
Sorry to call you wrong.

2254
02:02:12,490 --> 02:02:15,430
But they do have their songs on YouTube so you can listen to them.

2255
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:17,450
They have a...

2256
02:02:17,450 --> 02:02:22,630
Their whole album is called Nice Shot and all the songs are really good.

2257
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:23,930
I love Panda Boy.

2258
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:26,850
If I could get a song by Panda Boy, I would die.

2259
02:02:29,350 --> 02:02:33,590
One of my favorites, probably my favorite on the album, I really like Have a Nice Shot.

2260
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:34,650
I like Hazard Beat.

2261
02:02:35,190 --> 02:02:36,150
Hazard, hazard beat.

2262
02:02:36,670 --> 02:02:38,070
Hazard beat, hazard beat.

2263
02:02:38,170 --> 02:02:39,150
Hazard, hazard beat.

2264
02:02:39,550 --> 02:02:40,170
So good.

2265
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:42,250
Here, let me show you this.

2266
02:02:42,310 --> 02:02:43,830
Let me show you the picture of them.

2267
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:44,690
They're so cute.

2268
02:02:45,010 --> 02:02:46,210
Oh, gosh, they're so cute.

2269
02:02:46,430 --> 02:02:46,830
They're so cute.

2270
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:48,270
Hold on, I have to screenshot it though.

2271
02:02:49,030 --> 02:02:50,490
This is the album cover.

2272
02:02:51,210 --> 02:02:52,330
I got to go see them.

2273
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:54,910
This group specifically, I got to go see them live.

2274
02:02:56,590 --> 02:03:00,550
So I have a checkie with Pinky.

2275
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:06,940
This is them.

2276
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:10,300
The one on the left is...

2277
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:11,480
Well, okay, hold on.

2278
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:12,380
Wait, this is confusing.

2279
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:16,980
At the top, the one on the left is Pinky and the one on the right is Nia.

2280
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:18,020
And then...

2281
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:25,420
In the bigger picture, the one on the left is Nia and the one on the right is Pinky.

2282
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:28,760
Yeah, they're so cute.

2283
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:30,360
They're so cute.

2284
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:31,600
So...

2285
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:36,220
Even though they're not around anymore, I recommend their songs so much.

2286
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:42,320
I recommend all songs of Dempo-related.

2287
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:44,060
Dempo-relation.

2288
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:44,680
Okay.

2289
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:47,280
Okay.

2290
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:48,000
Okay.

2291
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:48,160
Hmm.

2292
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:51,720
What haven't I sang that is a really popular Dempo song?

2293
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:56,120
I could try Precious Summer, but I don't know if I can hit the notes at the end.

2294
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:57,660
Baby, baby.

2295
02:04:00,940 --> 02:04:03,000
You mean Nia and Pinky.

2296
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:04,100
Yeah.

2297
02:04:04,620 --> 02:04:06,220
Do you remember Pinky, Nora, Petra?

2298
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:06,660
I do!

2299
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:11,060
I do remember Pinope, Pinky, Nora, Petra.

2300
02:04:11,740 --> 02:04:12,220
Nia.

2301
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:15,660
I do.

2302
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:16,000
I do.

2303
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:16,680
I do.

2304
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:16,820
I do.

2305
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:17,460
I do.

2306
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:18,000
I do.

2307
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:18,420
Hmm.

2308
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:20,300
Did Future Diver...

2309
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:21,140
Did Denden Passion...

2310
02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:22,000
Did Sakura Operation...

2311
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:26,600
Dempo-gumi's version of Idol?

2312
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:27,980
I don't think they have it on here.

2313
02:04:28,660 --> 02:04:30,620
I think I would have seen it if they had it.

2314
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:32,160
Unfortunately, they don't.

2315
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:33,120
It doesn't seem it.

2316
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:35,600
It seems like they have it.

2317
02:04:36,820 --> 02:04:37,700
Oh, I don't know.

2318
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:39,060
Oh, someone asked for Sabotage.

2319
02:04:39,060 --> 02:04:39,420
You know what?

2320
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:40,020
I can do that one.

2321
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:43,420
So this is actually a cover.

2322
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:44,560
Okay.

2323
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:46,000
This is kind of bad.

2324
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:47,040
This is the only...

2325
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:47,560
I don't know.

2326
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:47,580
I don't know.

2327
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:47,620
I don't know.

2328
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:48,820
Like, this is...

2329
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:49,260
I don't...

2330
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:49,780
Okay.

2331
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:57,600
This is a cover of Sabotage by the Beastie Boys, but I don't really know the...

2332
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:59,000
I know this better than the original.

2333
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:02,340
This might kill my throat.

2334
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:03,120
Oh, gosh.

2335
02:05:03,180 --> 02:05:04,260
I mean, my throat's already dead.

2336
02:05:05,620 --> 02:05:06,900
Maybe I should have saved it for last.

2337
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:11,160
Mini.

2338
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:13,840
Nisachi.

2339
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:16,700
Eitaso.

2340
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:17,600
I don't know.

2341
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:18,740
Moga.

2342
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:19,680
Pinky.

2343
02:05:20,740 --> 02:05:21,300
Something.

2344
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:22,880
What did I miss?

2345
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:25,220
Here we go now.

2346
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:26,780
Tiger.

2347
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:27,380
Fire.

2348
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,160
Cyber.

2349
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:28,840
Fiber.

2350
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:29,560
Diver.

2351
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:30,220
Fiber.

2352
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:30,800
Ja.

2353
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:33,160
I can't stand it.

2354
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:34,500
I know you planned it.

2355
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:35,520
I've got to set it straight.

2356
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:36,620
This water gate.

2357
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:39,280
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here.

2358
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:42,600
Because your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear so.

2359
02:05:42,980 --> 02:05:45,140
While you sit back and wonder why.

2360
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:47,580
I got this fucking thorn in my throat.

2361
02:05:48,220 --> 02:05:50,600
Oh my, it's a mirage!

2362
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:54,140
I'm telling y'all, it's sabotage!

2363
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:05,340
So, so, so!

2364
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:06,660
So listen up!

2365
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:08,380
Cause you can't say nothing, nothing!

2366
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:11,160
You'll shut me down with the push of your button button!

2367
02:06:11,380 --> 02:06:13,460
All right, I'm gone!

2368
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:16,420
I'll tell you now, I'll keep it on and on!

2369
02:06:19,220 --> 02:06:19,740
I'm

2370
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:44,980
trying to tell you now, it's sabotage!

2371
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:23,320
You're against the world!

2372
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:34,340
Listen all of y'all, it's a sabotage!

2373
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:37,140
Listen all of y'all, it's a sabotage!

2374
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:39,960
Listen all of y'all, it's a sabotage!

2375
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:42,800
Listen all of y'all, it's a sabotage!

2376
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:23,320
I don't remember what they say here.

2377
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:51,580
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage!

2378
02:08:58,830 --> 02:08:59,210
Hahaha!

2379
02:09:01,570 --> 02:09:02,050
Yeah!

2380
02:09:02,310 --> 02:09:05,350
That was Denpokumi's version of sabotage!

2381
02:09:05,570 --> 02:09:06,990
By the Beastie Boys!

2382
02:09:11,150 --> 02:09:11,630
Yay!

2383
02:09:15,490 --> 02:09:19,930
It's so funny because when you look up, the cover for that is, first of all, so perfect.

2384
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:21,310
Hold on, sabotage.

2385
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:22,730
Denpokumi.

2386
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:24,850
The cover of it is so awesome.

2387
02:09:24,950 --> 02:09:27,150
They have little mustaches and sunglasses on.

2388
02:09:28,330 --> 02:09:36,410
And when you look at the comments on the YouTube video of this, half the comments are like, Yo, this is awesome!

2389
02:09:36,510 --> 02:09:39,590
And half of them are just like, what the hell did I just watch?

2390
02:09:39,650 --> 02:09:41,090
Look at them, they're so cute!

2391
02:09:41,810 --> 02:09:43,350
Oh my gosh, they're so young.

2392
02:09:43,530 --> 02:09:44,230
Here, I'll show you.

2393
02:09:45,030 --> 02:09:48,110
These are not the... this is the older members.

2394
02:09:48,210 --> 02:09:51,070
This is like the six members that I talked about at the beginning of the stream.

2395
02:09:51,730 --> 02:09:52,910
Hold on, I need a cursor.

2396
02:09:53,130 --> 02:09:53,890
I need like a pointer.

2397
02:09:56,350 --> 02:09:57,130
Aren't they so cute?

2398
02:09:58,890 --> 02:09:59,570
Let's see.

2399
02:10:00,110 --> 02:10:01,730
One second.

2400
02:10:03,430 --> 02:10:04,670
Let's just use this one.

2401
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:05,110
Save.

2402
02:10:06,230 --> 02:10:06,770
Save.

2403
02:10:07,730 --> 02:10:08,270
Save.

2404
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:09,850
This one looks like a Mickey Mouse hand.

2405
02:10:10,150 --> 02:10:11,090
Don't sue me, Disney.

2406
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:12,310
Oh, it's huge!

2407
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:18,640
So this is my Kamiyoshi.

2408
02:10:18,780 --> 02:10:19,520
That's Nemu.

2409
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:21,000
This is Moga.

2410
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:22,440
This is Risa.

2411
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:24,080
This is Mirin.

2412
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:25,660
This is Pinky.

2413
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:27,460
And this is Eitaso.

2414
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:31,880
So, out of all of these members, these three are still in the group.

2415
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:34,640
So Mirin, Risa, and Pinky.

2416
02:10:36,860 --> 02:10:37,340
Yeah.

2417
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:37,820
So...

2418
02:10:40,820 --> 02:10:43,800
Nemu has shaped my entire life and existence.

2419
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:46,800
This uniform, I have hanging up in my bedroom.

2420
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,060
They sold them.

2421
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:49,620
They sold them.

2422
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:51,500
The artist is iMadonna.

2423
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:53,200
She did a lot of work with them.

2424
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:55,040
Um...

2425
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:57,200
But it's their, like, anime versions of their faces.

2426
02:10:57,820 --> 02:10:59,000
I have this.

2427
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:04,660
And actually, also, in my office, I have the Deerstage uniform hung up.

2428
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:07,460
Because they also sold that before, too.

2429
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:09,640
Um... so...

2430
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:10,700
Yeah.

2431
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:12,560
Like, everywhere, I have posters.

2432
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:15,740
I have Denpagumi posters in my maid cafe.

2433
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:16,600
Like...

2434
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:18,240
I don't know.

2435
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:18,760
I'm...

2436
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:20,120
I'm Yume Minemu.

2437
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:21,300
Please sing for me.

2438
02:11:21,980 --> 02:11:22,580
Uh...

2439
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:23,740
Can I do it?

2440
02:11:23,740 --> 02:11:24,340
Can I do it?

2441
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:27,880
I'll think about it.

2442
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:35,160
So everywhere in my maid cafe, I have Denpagumi stuff everywhere.

2443
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:37,600
I see Denpagumi.

2444
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:39,220
I think about Denpagumi every day.

2445
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:44,240
So they're super duper important to me.

2446
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:45,300
I don't know.

2447
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:47,100
Hopefully... Hopefully...

2448
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:50,240
Hopefully I'm conveying their strength.

2449
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:53,720
Thank you for singing my favorite Beastie Boys song.

2450
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:54,280
I'm glad!

2451
02:11:54,980 --> 02:11:57,800
I've always actually wanted to sing that before, so...

2452
02:11:57,800 --> 02:11:58,720
I'm really excited.

2453
02:11:58,880 --> 02:11:59,460
I'm really happy.

2454
02:12:00,060 --> 02:12:00,620
Um...

2455
02:12:00,620 --> 02:12:03,900
But yeah, hopefully I'm conveying how awesome they are.

2456
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:07,980
It's hard to say without, like, just witnessing their power.

2457
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:09,200
But they're truly...

2458
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:11,700
Probably the best idols in the world.

2459
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:14,200
I believe.

2460
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:16,880
Um...

2461
02:12:17,820 --> 02:12:18,520
Let's see.

2462
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:19,880
Going back to this...

2463
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:22,640
Nagini...

2464
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:27,380
Sabotage...

2465
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:31,640
You had me at Otaku Girls.

2466
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:34,840
They're so goofy.

2467
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:38,440
They're just such a great group of people.

2468
02:12:40,590 --> 02:12:43,880
And honestly, just everyone at Dear Stage, too.

2469
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:45,460
Because...

2470
02:12:46,860 --> 02:12:47,700
You know.

2471
02:12:48,820 --> 02:12:49,150
It's...

2472
02:12:49,150 --> 02:13:07,130
It's a lot of idol groups would probably not have someone get married and have a baby and still let them perform, you know, and at least, you know, I don't know a lot about the inside of Tear Stage, but I would like to believe that they treat the idols there very well.

2473
02:13:07,230 --> 02:13:08,310
I would think so.

2474
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:10,210
This has been awesome.

2475
02:13:10,270 --> 02:13:10,950
You bring a lot of joy.

2476
02:13:10,990 --> 02:13:11,490
Thank you.

2477
02:13:13,070 --> 02:13:14,130
Thank you so much.

2478
02:13:17,390 --> 02:13:18,890
Which one is this one again?

2479
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:27,080
Is that the...

2480
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:30,040
No, that's...

2481
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:34,500
There is Notobochi.

2482
02:13:39,490 --> 02:13:41,670
I don't think I'm ready for Orange Realm.

2483
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:45,870
Actually, maybe I am since I just sang that and it was so goofy and funny.

2484
02:13:46,130 --> 02:13:47,030
There is Otsukaresama.

2485
02:13:47,730 --> 02:13:48,950
I don't think I can sing.

2486
02:13:48,950 --> 02:13:49,590
Otsukaresama.

2487
02:13:49,590 --> 02:13:50,270
It's too difficult.

2488
02:13:51,330 --> 02:13:52,210
It's so difficult.

2489
02:13:52,590 --> 02:13:53,310
This song is awesome.

2490
02:13:53,470 --> 02:14:00,630
Actually, the artist for Oyasumi Punpun did the art for this song, Ashita Chikyuu Ga Kona Gona Ni Nattemo.

2491
02:14:00,970 --> 02:14:06,170
It's a very popular song that like a lot of idols in different groups will cover.

2492
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:07,310
So I'll sing it also.

2493
02:14:10,590 --> 02:14:12,130
It's kind of fast, but I'll do my best.

2494
02:14:13,030 --> 02:14:13,430
Asano?

2495
02:14:13,570 --> 02:14:14,250
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2496
02:14:14,570 --> 02:14:15,250
Yes, yes, yes.

2497
02:14:23,300 --> 02:14:27,280
But yeah, the music video for this is also really beautiful.

2498
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:27,720
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2499
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:27,900
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2500
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:28,580
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2501
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:43,980
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2502
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:46,480
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2503
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:48,100
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2504
02:14:48,100 --> 02:14:49,120
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2505
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:50,080
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2506
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:53,320
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2507
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:53,920
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2508
02:14:54,540 --> 02:14:55,280
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2509
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:57,720
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2510
02:14:58,220 --> 02:15:04,080
The music video for this is also really beautiful.

2511
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:34,040
A little pause... and we are back.

2512
02:16:11,210 --> 02:16:15,890
A little pause... and we are back.

2513
02:16:15,910 --> 02:16:45,890
A little pause... and we are back.

2514
02:17:11,710 --> 02:17:15,890
A little pause... and we are back.

2515
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:58,990
A little pause...

2516
02:17:58,990 --> 02:17:58,990
and we are back.

2517
02:18:18,630 --> 02:18:20,030
A

2518
02:18:29,850 --> 02:18:36,570
little pause... and we are back.

2519
02:18:36,570 --> 02:18:38,270
Like, the last day on Earth.

2520
02:18:38,430 --> 02:18:43,030
What if the Earth, like, basically, like, ceases, like, uh, what's the word?

2521
02:18:43,170 --> 02:18:46,690
Um, um, like, breaks into pieces?

2522
02:18:47,370 --> 02:18:53,250
My favorite part of the line, or favorite part of the lyrics is just like, I'll just say, that sucks and die.

2523
02:19:05,050 --> 02:19:07,610
The lyrics just get longer and longer and longer.

2524
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:11,070
Or the titles, rather.

2525
02:19:12,990 --> 02:19:13,970
Relatable, right?

2526
02:19:16,830 --> 02:19:17,930
Ah, so.

2527
02:19:19,430 --> 02:19:19,910
Yeah.

2528
02:19:22,450 --> 02:19:24,170
It's a, it's not a happy song.

2529
02:19:24,470 --> 02:19:26,130
It's kind of, it's kind of sad, but it's really pretty.

2530
02:19:26,710 --> 02:19:27,770
Wow, thank you!

2531
02:19:28,350 --> 02:19:31,790
Kind of weird, in a good way, watching my Kamiyoshi that I've watched graduate twice.

2532
02:19:33,470 --> 02:19:33,950
Twice?

2533
02:19:36,870 --> 02:19:38,250
Watch your Kamiyoshi graduate.

2534
02:19:39,310 --> 02:19:41,910
Glad we could be here to share the love and remember the good times.

2535
02:19:43,630 --> 02:19:44,110
Um.

2536
02:19:46,090 --> 02:19:46,570
Um.

2537
02:19:47,170 --> 02:19:49,250
Well, my Kamiyoshi already graduated.

2538
02:19:49,510 --> 02:19:54,670
But it is my Kamiyoshi group, so you're not entire, you're not wrong, you're not wrong.

2539
02:19:57,830 --> 02:19:59,130
Are you a time traveler?

2540
02:19:59,410 --> 02:20:01,790
Do you see me graduate the future again?

2541
02:20:03,490 --> 02:20:05,030
He watched the VOD twice.

2542
02:20:05,130 --> 02:20:06,090
Oh, got it, got it.

2543
02:20:07,050 --> 02:20:07,530
Hahaha.

2544
02:20:07,610 --> 02:20:08,090
Hahaha.

2545
02:20:09,030 --> 02:20:13,390
Um, yes, I think I, MintPhantom, have only graduated once.

2546
02:20:14,230 --> 02:20:14,250
Hahaha.

2547
02:20:17,330 --> 02:20:17,850
Yeah.

2548
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:19,150
Ah.

2549
02:20:24,310 --> 02:20:25,690
L-Side Konguru.

2550
02:20:25,950 --> 02:20:26,210
Hahaha.

2551
02:20:26,590 --> 02:20:27,750
He re-zeroed.

2552
02:20:38,130 --> 02:20:38,650
Um.

2553
02:20:45,190 --> 02:20:45,710
Hahaha.

2554
02:20:45,970 --> 02:20:47,490
We change in the future.

2555
02:20:51,610 --> 02:20:52,130
Assistant.

2556
02:20:56,140 --> 02:20:57,140
Oh, yes!

2557
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:59,280
Okay, this is the song I did want to sing, but...

2558
02:21:00,040 --> 02:21:01,740
It's really fast I just remembered.

2559
02:21:01,860 --> 02:21:02,340
Got everything just done?

2560
02:21:02,620 --> 02:21:03,280
Remember when to remember on on on the earth...

2561
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:03,860
Do we really need Black еah?

2562
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:05,900
White is black right?

2563
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:06,900
Well,

2564
02:21:10,040 --> 02:21:11,660
because you said your favorite problem was the Kodami.

2565
02:21:11,660 --> 02:21:13,120
The same problem I remember.

2566
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:14,600
Ha.

2567
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:17,300
It's really really fast so I'm not going to try it.

2568
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:20,360
I've already made a fool of myself.

2569
02:21:22,140 --> 02:21:23,900
I am curious about the medley, you know.

2570
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,240
I think I'll try the medley.

2571
02:21:25,460 --> 02:21:25,760
.

2572
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:28,540
I see what songs they include.

2573
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:30,200
Oh, I have 40 minutes, okay.

2574
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:32,120
Where'd the medley go?

2575
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:39,680
Look, there's even a song called, Welcome to Deer Stage.

2576
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:43,120
So awesome.

2577
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:47,220
There's even a song called, Welcome to Deer Stage.

2578
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:50,820
When they perform it, it's so cute.

2579
02:21:50,980 --> 02:21:54,420
They have one of the members put on some glasses and stuff.

2580
02:21:54,420 --> 02:21:55,120
And they like...

2581
02:21:57,400 --> 02:22:00,040
I wonder actually if this song is 7 minutes long.

2582
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:01,620
Because it has a very long intro.

2583
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:02,660
I wonder if they keep it.

2584
02:22:04,220 --> 02:22:04,800
I'm curious.

2585
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:14,670
Let's try it.

2586
02:22:14,750 --> 02:22:15,470
Let's see what it's like.

2587
02:22:18,310 --> 02:22:19,650
Wait, what was the first one?

2588
02:22:19,990 --> 02:22:20,470
Die, die, die.

2589
02:22:21,390 --> 02:22:22,390
Die, die, die.

2590
02:22:24,870 --> 02:22:26,750
They put on glasses and go, Question?

2591
02:22:28,090 --> 02:22:28,170
Stop.

2592
02:22:32,850 --> 02:22:34,410
I arrived in time for Deer Stage.

2593
02:22:34,530 --> 02:22:34,930
Welcome to Deer Stage.

2594
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:35,990
Oh!

2595
02:22:37,130 --> 02:22:38,470
This is the song that I...

2596
02:22:38,470 --> 02:22:39,490
I was like...

2597
02:22:41,110 --> 02:22:42,130
This music video?

2598
02:22:42,490 --> 02:22:44,870
Actually, I said Sakura Operation is my favorite music video?

2599
02:22:45,050 --> 02:22:45,410
No.

2600
02:22:45,690 --> 02:22:46,530
This song.

2601
02:22:46,790 --> 02:22:48,590
This song is my favorite music video.

2602
02:22:48,790 --> 02:22:49,230
Oh my gosh.

2603
02:22:52,430 --> 02:22:53,230
Nanryo Jundan.

2604
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:54,010
And let's go.

2605
02:22:54,610 --> 02:22:57,170
Soshite Shi-chan, Ba-chan, Ka-chan, Do-chan, Nene-chan.

2606
02:22:57,250 --> 02:22:58,070
Ba-chan, Ka-chan, Do-chan, Nene-chan.

2607
02:22:59,150 --> 02:23:00,530
Naipo, Aibo, Da-da-na.

2608
02:23:00,590 --> 02:23:01,870
Dai-ha-ken-desu.

2609
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:02,890
Bambande-n-ba.

2610
02:23:03,030 --> 02:23:04,730
Toba-shi-te-rui.

2611
02:23:04,870 --> 02:23:05,630
Iku-sei.

2612
02:23:05,710 --> 02:23:06,730
Achi-kochi-sochi.

2613
02:23:06,810 --> 02:23:07,970
Dochi-shibou-gato-dono.

2614
02:23:08,070 --> 02:23:09,470
Boku-ninaru ki-mochi.

2615
02:23:09,510 --> 02:23:11,090
Se-kai-ni-todoke.

2616
02:23:13,390 --> 02:23:15,530
The music video was like half animated.

2617
02:23:15,810 --> 02:23:16,150
Itsudatte!

2618
02:23:16,270 --> 02:23:16,770
Imadatte!

2619
02:23:17,050 --> 02:23:17,450
Imi-ndatte!

2620
02:23:17,730 --> 02:23:18,130
Moku-datte!

2621
02:23:18,330 --> 02:23:18,770
Dare-datte!

2622
02:23:22,790 --> 02:23:24,130
And then, it's so awesome.

2623
02:23:24,250 --> 02:23:25,550
We put together.

2624
02:23:26,610 --> 02:23:27,290
There's like...

2625
02:23:27,290 --> 02:23:28,810
Oh god.

2626
02:23:29,050 --> 02:23:30,010
It's the hardest songs.

2627
02:23:30,070 --> 02:23:30,330
Why?

2628
02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:31,550
Oh, no.

2629
02:23:31,650 --> 02:23:32,670
We're gonna have to like, Oh no...

2630
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:01,280
This is the weirdest medley ever.

2631
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:10,480
Chug, chug, chug chug Okay,

2632
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:31,340
I can't do it anymore...

2633
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:34,720
This is not even like...

2634
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:35,740
a good medley.

2635
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:38,120
This is not even a good medley.

2636
02:24:38,180 --> 02:24:43,320
Like they just I thought it would... you know how medleys tend to... the songs bleed into each other?

2637
02:24:43,480 --> 02:24:44,660
No, it just stops.

2638
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:48,300
It just stops.

2639
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:52,980
That was funny.

2640
02:24:53,340 --> 02:24:54,000
Let's see.

2641
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:56,960
Have a half hour.

2642
02:24:58,300 --> 02:25:00,000
Wow, thanks Space Ghost!

2643
02:25:00,260 --> 02:25:03,600
Always love to have your singing on in the background while I do stuff.

2644
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:06,600
Yeah, okay.

2645
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:10,100
Oh gosh.

2646
02:25:11,460 --> 02:25:11,960
So...

2647
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:16,540
You know, it's funny that Yoko brought up the graduations.

2648
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:18,220
I thought if I ever graduate...

2649
02:25:18,220 --> 02:25:21,200
If I ever can do like a graduation concert...

2650
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:23,000
I would want to sing Orange Realm.

2651
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:25,600
Because to me it's such a special song too.

2652
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:29,940
You know, it's a very special song to Denpogumi fans and...

2653
02:25:32,340 --> 02:25:32,840
And...

2654
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:38,060
Like...

2655
02:25:38,060 --> 02:25:39,160
The whole...

2656
02:25:39,980 --> 02:25:41,340
Everyone changes their penlight...

2657
02:25:41,340 --> 02:25:42,760
There's no Orange member, right?

2658
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:43,840
But everyone...

2659
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:44,520
Well, there is now.

2660
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:45,480
There used to not be.

2661
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:48,680
But everyone changes their penlights to orange.

2662
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:49,280
And...

2663
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:51,380
It's just a really beautiful song.

2664
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:52,060
And so...

2665
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:56,300
Girl doesn't even remember.

2666
02:25:56,380 --> 02:25:57,040
I meant...

2667
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,880
If I graduated a second time.

2668
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:02,060
So...

2669
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,800
Yeah, it's just a really pretty song.

2670
02:26:05,240 --> 02:26:05,800
So...

2671
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:06,660
And...

2672
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:07,820
It's...

2673
02:26:07,820 --> 02:26:08,420
It's a good...

2674
02:26:08,420 --> 02:26:09,000
It's like...

2675
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,220
A song like...

2676
02:26:10,220 --> 02:26:11,000
Just kind of like...

2677
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,900
I'll never forget the memories here basically.

2678
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:14,560
You know?

2679
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:15,820
So...

2680
02:26:15,820 --> 02:26:17,740
I'm going to try and sing it and not cry.

2681
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:22,340
Oh gosh.

2682
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:23,920
Okay.

2683
02:26:31,170 --> 02:26:32,650
Don't sing it or you'll graduate.

2684
02:26:33,450 --> 02:26:35,570
No, I'm undoing the curse.

2685
02:26:46,810 --> 02:26:47,330
No,

2686
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:52,150
I'm undoing the curse.

2687
02:27:08,690 --> 02:27:09,270
Okay.

2688
02:27:09,270 --> 02:27:09,390
Oh, wait.

2689
02:27:09,530 --> 02:27:10,510
Oh, what's the...

2690
02:27:11,370 --> 02:27:11,950
Um...

2691
02:27:11,950 --> 02:27:13,190
Are you okay?

2692
02:27:13,270 --> 02:27:14,730
You don't know where my store?

2693
02:27:14,910 --> 02:27:16,170
I'm calling to you.

2694
02:27:16,370 --> 02:27:17,510
Orange day.

2695
02:27:17,790 --> 02:27:19,070
Magic and future.

2696
02:27:19,070 --> 02:27:19,850
Um...

2697
02:27:19,850 --> 02:27:21,210
Um...

2698
02:27:21,210 --> 02:27:22,410
The things we made together.

2699
02:27:23,010 --> 02:27:24,270
The love in my heart.

2700
02:27:24,550 --> 02:27:25,130
Hahaha.

2701
02:27:26,130 --> 02:27:26,930
Um...

2702
02:27:26,930 --> 02:27:28,410
Super Goobies!

2703
02:27:28,870 --> 02:27:31,030
When you're by my side.

2704
02:27:31,650 --> 02:27:34,390
My precious feelings.

2705
02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:38,790
I can't say anything anymore.

2706
02:27:39,950 --> 02:27:41,610
Every time our eyes meet.

2707
02:27:42,690 --> 02:27:44,490
My heart goes up.

2708
02:27:44,490 --> 02:27:49,330
I'll fly up, but you won't notice.

2709
02:27:50,910 --> 02:27:52,190
Don't change.

2710
02:27:55,190 --> 02:27:57,710
If you're dying on this same dream.

2711
02:28:00,550 --> 02:28:05,130
We're the same, even if it's not in color.

2712
02:28:07,090 --> 02:28:08,910
We're fated to stay together.

2713
02:28:11,210 --> 02:28:12,210
Forever.

2714
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:42,270
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I can't remember the Orange Ria mix.

2715
02:28:42,270 --> 02:28:44,630
But I remember the Kira Kira tune one better.

2716
02:28:52,410 --> 02:28:59,230
胸の奥で オレンジのぎゅっと 絞るみたいな恋心

2717
02:29:02,730 --> 02:29:11,520
甘酸っぱさを 抱きしめても 広がっていく 止められない 会えない時は

2718
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:32,440
その大きさが 切り取られた影でわかるの 眩しい光 逆光のどこかに 君の笑顔を 刻けばいつも 探した

2719
02:29:37,520 --> 02:30:01,640
私の中の 君が住んでる場所 A little pause... and we are back.

2720
02:30:23,380 --> 02:30:35,560
秘密の箱 宝物 消えることないオレンジ夢 カートは溢れ出すの

2721
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:48,000
心の中に灯るものがあれば 暗闇でも迷わない

2722
02:31:12,470 --> 02:31:13,750
That was Orange Reum.

2723
02:31:13,830 --> 02:31:15,450
Wow, I can't believe I sung it without crying!

2724
02:31:15,730 --> 02:31:15,970
Yeah!

2725
02:31:17,030 --> 02:31:19,390
But I know when I do though, can I get a tune mix?

2726
02:31:19,450 --> 02:31:19,750
Oh gosh.

2727
02:31:22,750 --> 02:31:23,470
Orange Reum.

2728
02:31:23,630 --> 02:31:27,550
But I should probably start singing some of the sadder songs that I've been not wanting to do.

2729
02:31:27,830 --> 02:31:30,630
Because I'm gonna run out of time and then I won't be able to sing them at all.

2730
02:31:34,010 --> 02:31:34,370
Oops.

2731
02:31:34,370 --> 02:31:36,350
I have no keeny-eaty songs.

2732
02:31:40,910 --> 02:31:41,830
It's crying time.

2733
02:31:43,270 --> 02:31:47,550
I don't know if I wanna do... I'll do WWD best now.

2734
02:31:47,550 --> 02:31:52,570
And probably do Kira Kira tune last.

2735
02:31:57,610 --> 02:31:58,630
Let's do that now.

2736
02:31:58,870 --> 02:31:59,870
We can also do Otsukare Summer.

2737
02:32:00,070 --> 02:32:01,270
Oh, Precious Summer too.

2738
02:32:03,470 --> 02:32:04,350
WWD best.

2739
02:32:04,570 --> 02:32:06,570
Since we did WWD and WWD 2.

2740
02:32:09,290 --> 02:32:12,920
I have to go to the bathroom.

2741
02:32:13,220 --> 02:32:14,800
I have to go to the little ghosty's room.

2742
02:32:19,720 --> 02:32:20,900
It's all this tea I'm drinking.

2743
02:32:20,980 --> 02:32:24,840
Look how many composers, people involved for the lyrics and everything.

2744
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:25,340
It's crazy.

2745
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:31,440
You can hear, like, some of their past songs in it.

2746
02:32:34,060 --> 02:32:35,180
This way.

2747
02:32:42,880 --> 02:33:22,680

Asha hashiri suzukenda It's a little too high for what my voice can do right now, but it's okay.

2750
02:34:13,700 --> 02:34:43,420

Oh...

2755
02:37:09,200 --> 02:37:11,200
It's hard to tell if you're like...

2756
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:15,000
Not a super Denpa fan obviously If you don't know Denpa so much but like...

2757
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:25,160
A lot of the lyrics kinda reference their old songs Or reference the members as you could see They even said Orange Realm Which is a song that I just sang And like...

2758
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:28,680
The choreography for the dance too Like is a lot of...

2759
02:37:29,220 --> 02:37:30,220
A lot of...

2760
02:37:30,900 --> 02:37:36,680
Their old choreo and stuff The music video just references a lot of stuff too It's a...

2761
02:37:37,940 --> 02:37:40,040
It's one big love song to like...

2762
02:37:40,040 --> 02:37:41,860
Denpa Gumi and their fans so...

2763
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:49,000
It's so awesome It's so awesome, it's so awesome And it's such a pretty song It's so fun and...

2764
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:50,240
Yeah, you notice that?

2765
02:37:50,300 --> 02:37:50,480
Yeah!

2766
02:37:55,040 --> 02:38:03,420
Yippee I love Denpa End of an era for sure But they're legends so they're...

2767
02:38:03,420 --> 02:38:06,400
Their legacy will live on Because...

2768
02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:10,080
They've changed so much They've influenced so much so...

2769
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:10,980

Ah...

2772
02:38:15,560 --> 02:38:20,160
People will continue loving Denpa They said that their story is ending So I wonder...

2773
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:22,420
If that means like a...

2774
02:38:23,100 --> 02:38:23,980
Like a...

2775
02:38:23,980 --> 02:38:25,500
Another group will come?

2776
02:38:25,560 --> 02:38:27,360
Maybe not Denpa Gumi Inc but...

2777
02:38:28,260 --> 02:38:28,860
Um...

2778
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:29,900
What could be...

2779
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:30,820
What could be...

2780
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:31,900
Electric...

2781
02:38:32,300 --> 02:38:35,440

Or...

2786
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:42,180
Rather...

2787
02:38:42,180 --> 02:38:43,020
They...

2788
02:38:43,020 --> 02:38:43,760
All...

2789
02:38:44,520 --> 02:38:45,740

Love Akiba so much And try to keep that spirit of Akiba alive too So I hope that...

2791
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:51,000
Um...

2792
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:52,220
That...

2793
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:54,020
Uh...

2794
02:38:56,260 --> 02:38:56,860

2796
02:38:58,920 --> 02:38:59,520

2798
02:39:04,420 --> 02:39:05,060
No, sorry...

One of the ex-members of Denpa Gumi Nemotonagi Is a Vtuber So...

2802
02:39:17,400 --> 02:39:20,680
You can find her by her name Uh...

Nemotonagi She goes by the same name as her Vtuber self too So...

2804
02:39:26,680 --> 02:39:27,080
Mmm...

2805
02:39:28,040 --> 02:39:28,680
Yeah...

2806
02:39:28,680 --> 02:39:30,500
Gems Company is actually affiliated...

2807
02:39:30,500 --> 02:39:31,140
It's like...

2808
02:39:31,140 --> 02:39:32,680
A collaboration between...

2809
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:34,100
Deerstage and...

2810
02:39:34,100 --> 02:39:35,460
Square Enix...

So...

2813
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:37,680

I didn't know that about Gems Company Yeah!

2815
02:39:40,300 --> 02:39:41,560
Deerstage is everywhere!

2816
02:39:43,380 --> 02:39:44,380
Isn't that crazy?

2817
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:46,920

02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:47,080

2821
02:39:49,180 --> 02:39:49,620
Mmm...

2822
02:39:49,620 --> 02:39:53,640
There's one Gems Company song that I love so much Uh...

2823
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:54,380
Hold on...

2824
02:39:54,380 --> 02:39:59,080
Let me see if I can find it It's one of the solo songs It's not like a...

2825
02:39:59,980 --> 02:40:02,540

2826
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:02,860
Um...

2827
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:04,680
It's one of the solo songs Uh...

2828
02:40:04,680 --> 02:40:06,880
If I were to ever make a song...

2829
02:40:06,880 --> 02:40:09,160
If I were to ever get my own original song...

2830
02:40:09,620 --> 02:40:10,020
Um...

2831
02:40:10,020 --> 02:40:11,260
Like a cool song...

2832
02:40:11,260 --> 02:40:12,240
I would reference this...

2833
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:12,600
I would like...

2834
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:12,920

2839
02:40:17,180 --> 02:40:18,180
I can't remember the name of it...

2840
02:40:18,180 --> 02:40:18,520
Cause I'm...

2841
02:40:18,520 --> 02:40:19,740
My brain is dumb...

2842
02:40:20,960 --> 02:40:21,360
Wait...

2843
02:40:22,180 --> 02:40:22,580

02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:41,420

02:40:43,510 --> 02:40:43,890

2861
02:40:57,350 --> 02:40:57,730
Shoujo...

2862
02:40:58,370 --> 02:40:58,750
Senso...

2863
02:40:59,630 --> 02:41:00,010
Paradox...

2864
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:04,130
Okay...

2865
02:41:06,650 --> 02:41:08,070
Manifesting a Mint Ori song...

2866
02:41:08,070 --> 02:41:08,430
Hehe...

2867
02:41:08,430 --> 02:41:08,530
I'm sorry...

2868
02:41:08,550 --> 02:41:09,730
We'll see...

2869
02:41:09,730 --> 02:41:10,350
I don't know...

2870
02:41:10,350 --> 02:41:10,790
Hahaha...

2871
02:41:10,790 --> 02:41:11,710
We'll see...

2872
02:41:11,710 --> 02:41:12,190
I don't know...

2873
02:41:12,190 --> 02:41:12,550
I don't know...

2874
02:41:12,550 --> 02:41:14,730
Do an Akiba themed original song someday?

2875
02:41:15,150 --> 02:41:15,790
Maybe...

2876
02:41:16,330 --> 02:41:16,650
Hehe...

2877
02:41:17,530 --> 02:41:18,170
Maybe...

2878
02:41:18,170 --> 02:41:19,050
Maybe I can...

2879
02:41:19,050 --> 02:41:20,490
Get a Panda Boy...

2880
02:41:20,490 --> 02:41:21,630
Hahaha...

2881
02:41:21,630 --> 02:41:22,870
Hmm...

2882
02:41:22,870 --> 02:41:23,730
I don't know...

2883
02:41:23,730 --> 02:41:24,870
I don't know...

2884
02:41:24,870 --> 02:41:25,430
I don't know...

2885
02:41:27,290 --> 02:41:27,930
Yeah...

2886
02:41:27,930 --> 02:41:28,350
Well...

2887
02:41:28,350 --> 02:41:28,890
Um...

2888
02:41:28,890 --> 02:41:30,210
There was one group that I really...

2889
02:41:30,210 --> 02:41:31,430
Really loved also...

2890
02:41:32,170 --> 02:41:32,810
Um...

2891
02:41:32,810 --> 02:41:34,230
It was kind of when like...

2892
02:41:34,230 --> 02:41:35,190
I wasn't...

2893
02:41:35,190 --> 02:41:35,790
Like...

2894
02:41:35,790 --> 02:41:36,570
You know when...

2895
02:41:36,570 --> 02:41:37,270
Like...

2896
02:41:37,270 --> 02:41:37,870
Uh...

2897
02:41:37,870 --> 02:41:38,750
Sorry...

2898
02:41:38,750 --> 02:41:39,710
I keep saying like...

2899
02:41:39,710 --> 02:41:40,430
Um...

2900
02:41:40,430 --> 02:41:41,150
So...

2901
02:41:41,150 --> 02:41:43,570
After my Kamiyoshi graduated from Denpa...

2902
02:41:43,570 --> 02:41:44,510
It kind of was in like...

2903
02:41:44,510 --> 02:41:45,170
A mourning period...

2904
02:41:45,630 --> 02:41:46,030
So...

2905
02:41:46,030 --> 02:41:47,210
I ended up...

2906
02:41:47,210 --> 02:41:47,650
Um...

2907
02:41:47,650 --> 02:41:50,210
I obviously still supported them...

2908
02:41:50,210 --> 02:41:50,890
But I...

2909
02:41:50,890 --> 02:41:51,890
Uh...

2910
02:41:51,890 --> 02:41:54,630
Ended up falling for another group called Engaging...

2911
02:41:54,630 --> 02:41:56,570
Who was also a Dear Stage group...

2912
02:41:57,190 --> 02:41:58,110
And one of the...

2913
02:41:58,110 --> 02:41:58,910
My favorite member...

2914
02:41:58,910 --> 02:42:00,470
My favorite member of that group...

2915
02:42:00,470 --> 02:42:01,210
She...

2916
02:42:01,210 --> 02:42:03,230
She also loved Nemu...

2917
02:42:03,230 --> 02:42:03,530
Haha...

2918
02:42:03,530 --> 02:42:05,010
Nemu was her Oshi too...

2919
02:42:05,010 --> 02:42:05,710
So...

2920
02:42:05,710 --> 02:42:06,070
Um...

2921
02:42:06,070 --> 02:42:07,370
I have a Checky album...

2922
02:42:07,370 --> 02:42:07,790
Completely...

2923
02:42:07,790 --> 02:42:07,850
Um...

2924
02:42:07,850 --> 02:42:09,010
Completely full of just...

2925
02:42:09,010 --> 02:42:10,950
Checkies from Engaging...

2926
02:42:10,950 --> 02:42:11,610
Um...

2927
02:42:11,610 --> 02:42:13,050
They were so great...

2928
02:42:13,050 --> 02:42:14,770
And their music was all composed by...

2929
02:42:14,770 --> 02:42:15,490
Um...

2930
02:42:15,490 --> 02:42:17,230
A music artist that I love...

2931
02:42:17,230 --> 02:42:18,190
Mosaic Wave...

2932
02:42:18,950 --> 02:42:20,130
And so...

2933
02:42:21,090 --> 02:42:21,730
Um...

2934
02:42:21,730 --> 02:42:22,030
Uh...

2935
02:42:22,030 --> 02:42:24,350
Because it was Mosaic Wave and Dear Stage...

2936
02:42:24,350 --> 02:42:25,210
Together...

2937
02:42:25,210 --> 02:42:26,030
I was like...

2938
02:42:26,030 --> 02:42:26,430
This is...

2939
02:42:26,430 --> 02:42:27,750
This is my Kami group...

2940
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:29,090
This is like the best group ever!

2941
02:42:29,450 --> 02:42:31,330
And then they ended up disbanding...

2942
02:42:31,330 --> 02:42:31,970
During...

2943
02:42:31,970 --> 02:42:33,230
The pandemic...

2944
02:42:33,230 --> 02:42:33,590
Haha...

2945
02:42:33,590 --> 02:42:34,390
So...

2946
02:42:34,390 --> 02:42:35,170
I...

2947
02:42:35,170 --> 02:42:35,710
Uh...

2948
02:42:35,710 --> 02:42:36,650
Um...

2949
02:42:36,650 --> 02:42:37,590
I've been...

2950
02:42:37,590 --> 02:42:37,830
Um...

2951
02:42:37,830 --> 02:42:38,630
Um...

2952
02:42:38,630 --> 02:42:39,790
It was...

2953
02:42:39,790 --> 02:42:40,130
Like...

2954
02:42:40,130 --> 02:42:40,890
For a long time...

2955
02:42:40,890 --> 02:42:42,750
I kind of stopped liking idols...

2956
02:42:42,750 --> 02:42:43,470
Um...

2957
02:42:43,470 --> 02:42:44,170
I focused...

2958
02:42:44,690 --> 02:42:45,910
A lot on Vtubers...

2959
02:42:45,910 --> 02:42:46,810
I kind of start...

2960
02:42:46,810 --> 02:42:47,910
Stopped liking...

2961
02:42:47,910 --> 02:42:48,950
Idols...

2962
02:42:48,950 --> 02:42:49,790
Because I was so...

2963
02:42:50,650 --> 02:42:51,610
Devastated by...

2964
02:42:51,610 --> 02:42:52,550
Losing them...

2965
02:42:52,550 --> 02:42:52,870
My...

2966
02:42:52,870 --> 02:42:53,250
My...

2967
02:42:53,250 --> 02:42:54,510
My favorite member of the group...

2968
02:42:54,510 --> 02:42:55,070
Actually...

2969
02:42:55,070 --> 02:42:55,630
Ria...

2970
02:42:55,630 --> 02:42:57,210
Ria in Denpogumi...

2971
02:42:57,210 --> 02:42:57,610
Um...

2972
02:42:57,610 --> 02:42:58,690
She's one of the new members...

2973
02:42:58,690 --> 02:42:59,170
But she...

2974
02:42:59,170 --> 02:43:00,470
Came from Engaging...

2975
02:43:01,870 --> 02:43:04,330
And they also got another member from Engaging...

2976
02:43:04,330 --> 02:43:05,470
That went to Denpogumi...

2977
02:43:05,470 --> 02:43:05,850
Called...

2978
02:43:05,850 --> 02:43:06,430
Uh...

2979
02:43:06,430 --> 02:43:07,470
Her name's Ai...

2980
02:43:07,470 --> 02:43:08,890
Aizawa Kozue...

2981
02:43:08,890 --> 02:43:10,250
You might recognize her...

2982
02:43:10,250 --> 02:43:11,730
Because she's a really popular...

2983
02:43:11,730 --> 02:43:12,330
Um...

2984
02:43:12,330 --> 02:43:12,630
Dancer...

2985
02:43:13,030 --> 02:43:13,630
Uh...

2986
02:43:13,630 --> 02:43:14,550
Like on Nico Nico...

2987
02:43:14,550 --> 02:43:15,530
And stuff like that...

2988
02:43:16,650 --> 02:43:17,770
And so...

2989
02:43:17,770 --> 02:43:18,750
Um...

2990
02:43:20,130 --> 02:43:20,730
Uh...

2991
02:43:20,730 --> 02:43:21,010
They...

2992
02:43:21,010 --> 02:43:21,270
She...

2993
02:43:21,270 --> 02:43:22,670
But she graduated from the group...

2994
02:43:22,670 --> 02:43:23,030
Because...

2995
02:43:23,030 --> 02:43:23,370
Um...

2996
02:43:23,370 --> 02:43:23,750
She...

2997
02:43:24,430 --> 02:43:25,870
Had some health issues...

2998
02:43:25,870 --> 02:43:26,790
Unfortunately...

2999
02:43:26,790 --> 02:43:27,490
Um...

3000
02:43:27,490 --> 02:43:29,030
But Ria is still in the group...

3001
02:43:29,030 --> 02:43:30,050
And she was in Engaging...

3002
02:43:30,050 --> 02:43:30,430
Um...

3003
02:43:30,970 --> 02:43:32,710
She was a member of Engaging...

3004
02:43:32,710 --> 02:43:33,610
When they were around...

3005
02:43:33,610 --> 02:43:35,350
But my Kamiyoshi...

3006
02:43:35,350 --> 02:43:35,750
Well...

3007
02:43:35,750 --> 02:43:36,410
Not Kamiyoshi...

3008
02:43:36,430 --> 02:43:37,790
My Oshii from Engaging...

3009
02:43:37,790 --> 02:43:38,250
She...

3010
02:43:38,250 --> 02:43:38,570
Uh...

3011
02:43:38,570 --> 02:43:40,370
She basically like...

3012
02:43:40,370 --> 02:43:41,310
Left the internet...

3013
02:43:42,170 --> 02:43:42,890
So...

3014
02:43:43,410 --> 02:43:43,770
But...

3015
02:43:43,770 --> 02:43:44,430
Yesterday...

3016
02:43:44,430 --> 02:43:45,270
She posted...

3017
02:43:45,270 --> 02:43:47,090
She made a post on Instagram...

3018
02:43:47,090 --> 02:43:47,610
Because...

3019
02:43:47,610 --> 02:43:48,850
Because of the...

3020
02:43:48,850 --> 02:43:50,170
Denpogumi announcement...

3021
02:43:50,170 --> 02:43:51,110
So I was like...

3022
02:43:51,110 --> 02:43:52,210
My Oshii...

3023
02:43:52,210 --> 02:43:52,690
My...

3024
02:43:52,690 --> 02:43:53,750
Oshii posted...

3025
02:43:55,370 --> 02:43:55,730
Yeah...

3026
02:43:56,090 --> 02:43:56,710
I understand...

3027
02:43:56,710 --> 02:43:57,670
When my Oshii graduated...

3028
02:43:57,670 --> 02:43:59,230
I nearly stopped watching YouTubers...

3029
02:43:59,230 --> 02:43:59,790
Yeah...

3030
02:43:59,790 --> 02:44:01,510
I get it...

3031
02:44:01,510 --> 02:44:02,970
I get it...

3032
02:44:02,970 --> 02:44:03,570
But...

3033
02:44:03,570 --> 02:44:03,950
Now...

3034
02:44:03,950 --> 02:44:05,110
I have some other idols...

3035
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:06,230
That I really really love...

3036
02:44:06,230 --> 02:44:07,210
So...

3037
02:44:07,210 --> 02:44:09,470
And I still love Denpogumi...

3038
02:44:09,470 --> 02:44:10,550
And I will love them until...

3039
02:44:10,550 --> 02:44:11,910
Their very last day...

3040
02:44:11,910 --> 02:44:12,730
And beyond...

3041
02:44:12,730 --> 02:44:13,690
So...

3042
02:44:13,690 --> 02:44:14,770
Yeah...

3043
02:44:15,570 --> 02:44:17,770
Sometimes it just takes some time to...

3044
02:44:18,370 --> 02:44:19,850
Get back into...

3045
02:44:20,970 --> 02:44:22,490
Get back into...

3046
02:44:22,490 --> 02:44:23,330
But you...

3047
02:44:23,330 --> 02:44:24,590
You know...

3048
02:44:24,590 --> 02:44:25,270
Um...

3049
02:44:25,270 --> 02:44:26,270
You...

3050
02:44:26,270 --> 02:44:26,950
You know...

3051
02:44:28,630 --> 02:44:30,530
If you like something...

3052
02:44:30,530 --> 02:44:31,110
You know...

3053
02:44:31,110 --> 02:44:31,870
You don't have to...

3054
02:44:31,870 --> 02:44:32,750
Give it up...

3055
02:44:32,750 --> 02:44:33,170
Like for me...

3056
02:44:33,170 --> 02:44:34,050
I liked idols...

3057
02:44:34,050 --> 02:44:35,050
But it was hard to find...

3058
02:44:35,050 --> 02:44:35,870
Someone else...

3059
02:44:35,870 --> 02:44:36,210
To...

3060
02:44:36,210 --> 02:44:36,390
To...

3061
02:44:36,390 --> 02:44:37,170
Support...

3062
02:44:37,170 --> 02:44:37,930
And everything...

3063
02:44:37,930 --> 02:44:39,770
Den Den passion till the end...

3064
02:44:39,770 --> 02:44:40,070
Exactly!

3065
02:44:40,830 --> 02:44:42,650
Luckily I found a certain maid...

3066
02:44:42,650 --> 02:44:44,430
You found another maid?

3067
02:44:45,150 --> 02:44:47,390
I missed the maid with the magic voice...

3068
02:44:48,550 --> 02:44:49,590
Stop it...

3069
02:44:50,950 --> 02:44:51,990
Stop it...

3070
02:44:54,370 --> 02:44:55,950
Gotta give yourself a grief period...

3071
02:44:55,950 --> 02:44:57,130
For some graduations...

3072
02:44:57,130 --> 02:44:57,630
Yeah...

3073
02:44:57,630 --> 02:44:59,190
Idols are very ephemeral...

3074
02:44:59,190 --> 02:45:00,070
They can be...

3075
02:45:00,070 --> 02:45:00,290
Right?

3076
02:45:00,770 --> 02:45:01,290
But...

3077
02:45:01,290 --> 02:45:02,230
With Denpogumi...

3078
02:45:02,230 --> 02:45:03,630
I've had them for so long...

3079
02:45:03,630 --> 02:45:04,330
I cannot...

3080
02:45:04,930 --> 02:45:05,890
I can only...

3081
02:45:05,890 --> 02:45:06,190
You know...

3082
02:45:06,190 --> 02:45:06,690
Obviously...

3083
02:45:06,690 --> 02:45:07,870
No matter how much time...

3084
02:45:07,870 --> 02:45:08,410
I had with them...

3085
02:45:08,410 --> 02:45:09,190
I would wish them off...

3086
02:45:09,190 --> 02:45:09,830
With a smile...

3087
02:45:09,830 --> 02:45:10,150
But...

3088
02:45:10,150 --> 02:45:11,850
I can only feel like this...

3089
02:45:11,850 --> 02:45:13,150
It feels right...

3090
02:45:13,150 --> 02:45:13,870
Prior to me...

3091
02:45:13,870 --> 02:45:14,270
It's just like...

3092
02:45:14,270 --> 02:45:15,330
I never thought this day would come...

3093
02:45:15,330 --> 02:45:15,670
But also...

3094
02:45:15,670 --> 02:45:16,370
I feel like...

3095
02:45:17,090 --> 02:45:18,530
They've been around for so long...

3096
02:45:18,530 --> 02:45:19,190
It's okay...

3097
02:45:19,190 --> 02:45:20,070
It's okay...

3098
02:45:22,010 --> 02:45:22,850
I'm gonna go grab...

3099
02:45:22,850 --> 02:45:23,590
Some more water...

3100
02:45:25,010 --> 02:45:25,730
And then...

3101
02:45:25,730 --> 02:45:26,150
Um...

3102
02:45:26,990 --> 02:45:28,070
I'm going to sing...

3103
02:45:28,070 --> 02:45:29,110
So gimme...

3104
02:45:29,110 --> 02:45:30,090
Just a second...

3105
02:45:30,090 --> 02:45:30,590
To go grab...

3106
02:45:30,590 --> 02:45:31,470
Some more water...

3107
02:45:32,330 --> 02:45:33,050
And then...

3108
02:45:33,050 --> 02:45:33,530
Oh...

3109
02:45:33,530 --> 02:45:33,990
I have to...

3110
02:45:33,990 --> 02:45:34,170
Wait...

3111
02:45:34,170 --> 02:45:34,630
Nevermind...

3112
02:45:36,190 --> 02:45:36,470
Oh my gosh...

3113
02:45:36,470 --> 02:45:36,910
Nevermind...

3114
02:45:36,910 --> 02:45:38,250
I'm not going to go grab more water...

3115
02:45:38,250 --> 02:45:39,070
I'm going to sing...

3116
02:45:39,070 --> 02:45:39,570
Precious Summer!

3117
02:45:46,330 --> 02:45:47,530
I only have...

3118
02:45:47,530 --> 02:45:48,230
10 minutes...

3119
02:45:48,230 --> 02:45:48,850
Until my...

3120
02:45:48,850 --> 02:45:50,130
Karaoke subscription...

3121
02:45:50,130 --> 02:45:51,030
Expires...

3122
02:45:51,030 --> 02:45:52,630
Oh no...

3123
02:45:54,950 --> 02:45:56,390
Oh my gosh...

3124
02:45:56,390 --> 02:45:57,210
I don't think...

3125
02:45:57,210 --> 02:45:57,930
I can sing this one...

3126
02:45:57,930 --> 02:45:58,350
Very well...

3127
02:45:58,350 --> 02:45:58,730
Either...

3128
02:45:58,730 --> 02:46:00,150
But that's okay...

3129
02:46:00,870 --> 02:46:01,830
Let's go...

3130
02:46:02,590 --> 02:46:03,070

02:46:33,810 --> 02:46:34,590
Yes Ho!

3140
02:46:34,670 --> 02:46:35,850
I'm just bubbling all the lyrics to the song...

3141
02:46:35,850 --> 02:46:36,410

3143
02:47:25,090 --> 02:47:26,170
I'm TIRED...

3144
02:47:27,470 --> 02:47:29,330
This song is so fun though...

3145
02:47:29,330 --> 02:47:30,170
I know the song...

Are you feeling it?

3154
02:48:23,860 --> 02:48:24,620
Hoshi hito!

3155
02:48:25,860 --> 02:48:27,600
Crimson fireph lovely...

3156
02:49:30,170 --> 02:49:31,590
I'm sorry I'm so out of breath.

3157
02:49:49,400 --> 02:49:53,580
I'm so tired.

3158
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:09,560
I feel a pressure summer.

3159
02:50:09,700 --> 02:50:10,300
No, it's precious.

3160
02:50:13,160 --> 02:50:14,920
I felt the pressure there though.

3161
02:50:15,040 --> 02:50:15,780
Holy cow.

3162
02:50:15,780 --> 02:50:20,460
My brain just said, I don't think I'm gonna read anymore.

3163
02:50:21,880 --> 02:50:25,300
Oh my god.

3164
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:28,720
No break time.

3165
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:29,880
No break time.

3166
02:50:32,780 --> 02:50:34,560
Wait, is this song really fast too?

3167
02:50:34,720 --> 02:50:35,820
They're all so fast!

3168
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:38,040
I love the high energy of that one.

3169
02:50:38,120 --> 02:50:38,880
It's so fun!

3170
02:50:39,200 --> 02:50:42,360
It's one of my favorite newer songs that Denpa has put out.

3171
02:50:51,460 --> 02:50:52,820
I can't wait to listen to it.

3172
02:50:56,740 --> 02:50:57,620
I don't

3173
02:51:07,150 --> 02:51:07,990
know, bye bye.

3174
02:51:08,130 --> 02:51:11,530
Oh, this song!

3175
02:51:11,690 --> 02:51:15,530
The music video is so awesome because they sent the song into space with a weather balloon!

3176
02:51:16,170 --> 02:51:18,650
Oh my god, what is this katakana?

3177
02:52:01,510 --> 02:52:03,490
I can't wait to listen to it.

3178
02:52:04,710 --> 02:52:05,430
It's so cool!

3179
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:06,470
It's so cool!

3180
02:52:06,790 --> 02:52:07,870
Here we go again.

3181
02:52:07,910 --> 02:52:08,770
Oh, and our turn!

3182
02:52:09,210 --> 02:52:09,570
Okay, that's a lot.

3183
02:52:09,570 --> 02:52:09,790
What is this song?

3184
02:52:09,790 --> 02:52:09,990
Don't look at me!

3185
02:52:10,290 --> 02:52:12,290
I'm so surprised.

3186
02:52:12,430 --> 02:52:15,850
Oh, my god.

3187
02:52:15,850 --> 02:52:16,930
I don't know what's the title, but it's amazing.

3188
02:52:32,620 --> 02:52:33,380
That's the last one.

3189
02:52:33,500 --> 02:52:33,980
What?

3190
02:52:34,420 --> 02:52:34,620
It's amazing.

3191
02:52:34,620 --> 02:52:35,300
But that's all I can think about.

3192
02:52:58,180 --> 02:52:58,660
It's all I can think about.

3193
02:52:58,660 --> 02:52:59,160
I don't know.

3194
02:52:59,160 --> 02:53:01,980
All I want to do is hear you sing.

3195
02:53:01,980 --> 02:53:04,200
Cute gibberish.

3196
02:53:08,270 --> 02:53:10,730
My head is going crazy.

3197
02:53:11,940 --> 02:53:14,970
My head is going crazy.

3198
02:53:15,410 --> 02:53:24,970
Oh my gosh.

3199
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:29,250
I have 5 minutes left so...

3200
02:53:30,210 --> 02:53:33,690
I won't do evergreen.

3201
02:53:33,690 --> 02:53:34,910
I can save that for another day.

3202
02:53:35,870 --> 02:53:37,950
I think I said I would do Kirakirachun.

3203
02:53:38,650 --> 02:53:39,010
Last.

3204
02:53:40,490 --> 02:53:41,810
I didn't do Denparinai.

3205
02:53:50,870 --> 02:53:51,590
Oh, vandalism!

3206
02:53:56,870 --> 02:53:58,570
Wait, maybe I have time for both of these.

3207
02:54:00,710 --> 02:54:01,850
Maybe I have time for this one.

3208
02:54:02,530 --> 02:54:03,670
And for Kirakirachun.

3209
02:54:05,770 --> 02:54:06,770
I love this one.

3210
02:54:06,830 --> 02:54:07,870
Itsuka Haruka Kanatai.

3211
02:54:09,230 --> 02:54:10,210
This one is so pretty.

3212
02:54:10,950 --> 02:54:12,730
Maybe I'll do a short version of it.

3213
02:54:13,690 --> 02:54:15,130
I guess we need a part 2, maybe.

3214
02:55:38,790 --> 02:55:43,430
I'll do the short version of the second one.

3215
02:55:43,490 --> 02:55:44,830
And also, I want to do another one.

3216
02:55:44,830 --> 02:55:45,050
They are going to say it´s just a joke.

3217
02:55:48,830 --> 02:55:51,890
Let's do it.

3218
02:56:29,520 --> 02:56:32,740
A little pause...

3219
02:56:32,740 --> 02:56:32,740
and we are back.

3220
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:36,980
Oh my god, I'm not gonna have enough time!

3221
02:57:14,200 --> 02:57:32,740
Oh my god, I'm not gonna have enough time!

3222
02:57:39,560 --> 02:57:40,040
No!

3223
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:48,820
My subscription!

3224
02:57:49,140 --> 02:57:49,880
I have to stop it early!

3225
02:57:51,740 --> 02:57:54,080
I wonder if it'll let me finish singing Kirakirachun.

3226
02:57:54,220 --> 02:57:54,960
Okay, sorry.

3227
02:57:56,360 --> 02:57:57,120
No, no!

3228
02:57:57,240 --> 02:57:57,720
Subscription!

3229
02:57:57,840 --> 02:57:58,120
Subscription!

3230
02:57:58,820 --> 02:57:59,260
My subscription!

3231
02:57:59,900 --> 02:58:00,380
Kirakirachun!

3232
02:58:00,380 --> 02:58:00,860
Kirakirachun!

3233
02:58:01,380 --> 02:58:06,180
Kirakirararararara Kirakirararararararararararararararararararararar Kirakirakirakirakirakirakirakirakiratokirakirakira This song is so important to me!

3234
02:58:06,220 --> 02:58:07,080
I just wanna sing it!

3235
02:58:07,180 --> 02:58:08,680
Where are you Kirakirachun?

3236
02:58:10,880 --> 02:58:11,340
Kirakirakirra...

3237
02:58:14,060 --> 02:58:14,580
Where... oh!

3238
02:58:23,040 --> 02:58:24,220
Moment of truth.

3239
02:59:03,720 --> 02:59:18,320
Thank you for watching!

3240
02:59:18,340 --> 02:59:36,860
Thank you

3241
02:59:43,130 --> 02:59:54,590
for watching!

3242
03:00:08,810 --> 03:00:24,570
Thank you for watching!

3243
03:00:24,610 --> 03:00:52,270
Thank you for watching!

3244
03:01:06,630 --> 03:01:23,690
Thank you for watching!

3245
03:01:24,610 --> 03:01:54,450
Thank you for watching!

3246
03:02:22,460 --> 03:02:26,680
I think I got that last one wrong.

3247
03:02:26,820 --> 03:02:27,720
I don't remember it.

3248
03:02:27,760 --> 03:02:27,960
Wait.

3249
03:02:28,940 --> 03:02:29,340
Rokunin?

3250
03:02:29,340 --> 03:02:29,740
Rokunin?

3251
03:02:29,900 --> 03:02:30,300
Rokunin?

3252
03:02:30,660 --> 03:02:31,060
Rokunin?

3253
03:02:31,100 --> 03:02:31,260
Wait.

3254
03:02:32,120 --> 03:02:32,520
Rokunin?

3255
03:02:32,520 --> 03:02:33,280
Wait, I said Mutsu.

3256
03:02:34,780 --> 03:02:35,180
Rokunin?

3257
03:02:36,480 --> 03:02:37,620
Wait, I don't remember.

3258
03:02:37,960 --> 03:02:39,060
Whatever, it's fine.

3259
03:02:39,180 --> 03:02:39,900
I got the other one.

3260
03:02:40,560 --> 03:02:42,000
I got the other one.

3261
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:42,780
I got the other one.

3262
03:02:43,780 --> 03:02:45,700
I won't give up on my dream of that day!

3263
03:03:25,540 --> 03:03:27,120
Is the past gone now?

3264
03:03:27,220 --> 03:03:27,560
Let's see!

3265
03:03:28,060 --> 03:03:29,100
It should be, right?

3266
03:03:30,180 --> 03:03:31,080
What if it's not?

3267
03:03:31,320 --> 03:03:32,240
That would be so embarrassing.

3268
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:33,980
I rushed to it.

3269
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:36,320
I rushed to do it!

3270
03:03:36,520 --> 03:03:38,480
That is the last song.

3271
03:03:38,720 --> 03:03:39,960
And it makes 20 songs!

3272
03:03:40,320 --> 03:03:41,020
I want to do it!

3273
03:03:41,980 --> 03:03:43,700
I want to do it!

3274
03:03:44,400 --> 03:03:45,200
Let's see...

3275
03:03:46,440 --> 03:03:46,840
Yeah!

3276
03:03:48,240 --> 03:03:49,100
There it is!

3277
03:03:50,440 --> 03:03:50,840
Tojiru.

3278
03:03:50,840 --> 03:03:51,240
Yep.

3279
03:03:52,200 --> 03:03:52,600
Cancel.

3280
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:54,920
Oh wait, not cancel.

3281
03:03:55,120 --> 03:03:55,680
There we go.

3282
03:03:57,580 --> 03:03:59,240
Erase the yo-yaku.

3283
03:04:01,360 --> 03:04:04,160
I thought it might stop me mid-song, but it didn't!

3284
03:04:06,040 --> 03:04:06,820
I have to pee.

3285
03:04:09,160 --> 03:04:10,760
Oh, I'll leave this up so you can hear it.

3286
03:04:11,720 --> 03:04:12,440
I'll be right back.

3287
03:04:13,780 --> 03:04:14,580
Get some water.

3288
03:04:14,840 --> 03:04:16,100
And go to the bathroom.

3289
03:04:16,860 --> 03:04:17,300
BRB.

3290
03:04:19,280 --> 03:04:19,720
Tempogumi.

3291
03:04:19,940 --> 03:04:20,960
It's my Oshii group.

3292
03:04:21,500 --> 03:04:23,800
For more than a decade, too, it still doesn't feel real.

3293
03:04:23,860 --> 03:04:24,140
I know.

3294
03:04:24,580 --> 03:04:26,060
Your karaoke cheered me up a lot.

3295
03:04:26,120 --> 03:04:26,720
Thank you so much.

3296
03:04:26,820 --> 03:04:27,380
Thank you!

3297
03:04:29,100 --> 03:04:29,880
Thank you!

3298
03:04:30,220 --> 03:04:30,900
Oh, BRB.

3299
03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:31,440
BRB.

3300
03:06:33,720 --> 03:06:34,360
I'm back.

3301
03:06:37,220 --> 03:06:38,420
I'm back, everybody.

3302
03:06:40,200 --> 03:06:40,640
Cease.

3303
03:06:40,640 --> 03:06:41,560
Cease all activities.

3304
03:06:43,340 --> 03:06:43,780
Cease.

3305
03:06:43,900 --> 03:06:45,100
Cease your activities.

3306
03:06:45,420 --> 03:06:46,220
I'm back.

3307
03:06:48,520 --> 03:06:49,360
Yippee!

3308
03:06:50,480 --> 03:06:52,380
20 songs of...

3309
03:06:52,900 --> 03:06:56,020
Well, basic... almost 20 songs.

3310
03:06:56,440 --> 03:06:58,840
Full Tempogumi ink power.

3311
03:07:01,600 --> 03:07:04,740
Did you guys feel the power of Tempogumi?

3312
03:07:05,560 --> 03:07:11,220
In fact, you only got the smallest fraction of Tempogumi's power.

3313
03:07:11,680 --> 03:07:13,240
They're the most powerful.

3314
03:07:14,720 --> 03:07:15,760
Thank you for the karaoke.

3315
03:07:16,320 --> 03:07:17,260
No, thank you!

3316
03:07:17,760 --> 03:07:19,640
I wanna see if they have a song on here real quick.

3317
03:07:21,060 --> 03:07:21,760
I wonder.

3318
03:07:23,100 --> 03:07:24,800
Even though this song doesn't...

3319
03:07:25,780 --> 03:07:27,120
Oh wait, you can't see anymore.

3320
03:07:28,120 --> 03:07:29,260
I'll keep it a secret.

3321
03:07:29,600 --> 03:07:30,060
Arigato, arigato.

3322
03:07:30,380 --> 03:07:30,800
Chuuu.

3323
03:07:33,080 --> 03:07:33,500
Arigato!

3324
03:07:36,180 --> 03:07:36,600
Ah.

3325
03:07:38,680 --> 03:07:39,100
Ah.

3326
03:07:40,200 --> 03:07:41,500
Keep this song a secret.

3327
03:07:41,600 --> 03:07:42,940
Maybe I'll perform it in the future.

3328
03:07:42,940 --> 03:07:45,420
I always have wanted to perform this with a group of people though.

3329
03:07:46,140 --> 03:07:49,200
So, I think it's... the song does best as a group.

3330
03:07:49,480 --> 03:07:50,500
Oh, they do have it!

3331
03:07:50,860 --> 03:07:52,740
Oh, no they don't.

3332
03:07:52,840 --> 03:07:53,860
They don't have it!

3333
03:07:54,580 --> 03:07:55,940
So I can never sing it.

3334
03:07:57,960 --> 03:07:58,620
Never mind.

3335
03:07:59,800 --> 03:08:01,680
I can... I can't sing it.

3336
03:08:02,080 --> 03:08:02,900
In karaoke.

3337
03:08:03,460 --> 03:08:05,460
But maybe one day I can sing it.

3338
03:08:05,940 --> 03:08:06,900
Like on a stage.

3339
03:08:08,800 --> 03:08:10,480
But it's better as a group song.

3340
03:08:13,720 --> 03:08:16,120
It's also better as a live song.

3341
03:08:16,320 --> 03:08:17,860
Like the song itself is good but...

3342
03:08:17,860 --> 03:08:18,640
Hearing it...

3343
03:08:19,160 --> 03:08:21,180
Experiencing it live is way better.

3344
03:08:27,800 --> 03:08:28,240
Yeah.

3345
03:08:28,440 --> 03:08:29,580
So I used to...

3346
03:08:30,300 --> 03:08:31,160
Perform a little.

3347
03:08:31,360 --> 03:08:33,080
Actually, I don't want to listen to this music anymore.

3348
03:08:34,320 --> 03:08:34,960
I'm gonna...

3349
03:08:34,960 --> 03:08:37,500
I'm gonna turn off this and we're gonna listen to...

3350
03:08:38,480 --> 03:08:39,040
Let's see.

3351
03:08:39,100 --> 03:08:40,940
What Dempagumi music can I put on?

3352
03:08:43,880 --> 03:08:44,320
Dempagumi...

3353
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:45,640
Ah...

3354
03:08:46,480 --> 03:08:47,000
What's that?

3355
03:08:47,340 --> 03:08:47,660
What...

3356
03:08:47,660 --> 03:08:48,300
Um...

3357
03:08:51,860 --> 03:08:52,720
It's not MIDI.

3358
03:08:53,660 --> 03:08:54,400
Oh my gosh.

3359
03:08:54,520 --> 03:08:55,320
What's the...

3360
03:08:56,580 --> 03:08:56,980
Um...

3361
03:08:56,980 --> 03:08:58,280
The small...

3362
03:08:58,280 --> 03:08:58,840
The...

3363
03:08:58,840 --> 03:08:59,540
Not small.

3364
03:09:00,040 --> 03:09:01,120
Why can't I think of it?

3365
03:09:01,700 --> 03:09:02,100
Um...

3366
03:09:02,100 --> 03:09:04,220
There's so many more songs that I wanted to sing too.

3367
03:09:04,280 --> 03:09:06,540
But I would have messed up every single one of them.

3368
03:09:06,580 --> 03:09:06,900
So you know what?

3369
03:09:06,900 --> 03:09:07,120
It's okay.

3370
03:09:07,560 --> 03:09:08,480
Not lo-fi.

3371
03:09:09,060 --> 03:09:09,860
Not chiptune.

3372
03:09:10,020 --> 03:09:10,260
Um...

3373
03:09:10,260 --> 03:09:11,300
Like when it's a music box.

3374
03:09:11,480 --> 03:09:11,820
Music...

3375
03:09:11,820 --> 03:09:12,040
Oh...

3376
03:09:12,040 --> 03:09:12,380
Or...

3377
03:09:14,020 --> 03:09:14,340
Org...

3378
03:09:15,480 --> 03:09:16,120
Or...

3379
03:09:21,360 --> 03:09:22,000
Org...

3380
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:22,120
Org -or...

3381
03:09:24,460 --> 03:09:25,540
Org-or...

3382
03:09:29,720 --> 03:09:30,680
Here we go.

3383
03:09:30,900 --> 03:09:32,000
Org-or...

3384
03:09:32,960 --> 03:09:34,640
I can just repeat this.

3385
03:09:35,580 --> 03:09:36,200
Oh.

3386
03:09:36,240 --> 03:09:36,800
This doesn't add.

3387
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:37,460
Hold on.

3388
03:09:38,340 --> 03:09:39,280
Let me...

3389
03:09:41,280 --> 03:09:41,920
Children...

3390
03:09:41,920 --> 03:09:42,420
Waaaaaaaahhhhh...

3391
03:09:47,100 --> 03:09:47,740
OMG.

3392
03:09:47,740 --> 03:09:48,980
Oh my god, it was so fucking loud.

3393
03:09:49,920 --> 03:09:51,000
What even was that?

3394
03:09:52,300 --> 03:09:54,560
I exited out of it so fast I couldn't even tell.

3395
03:09:54,860 --> 03:09:57,040
That I just... I just went...

3396
03:09:57,040 --> 03:09:59,500
I exited out of it so fast it took me to eBay.

3397
03:09:59,740 --> 03:10:01,220
Where I was looking at Metal Gear items.

3398
03:10:03,240 --> 03:10:04,200
Okay, here we go.

3399
03:10:04,580 --> 03:10:05,780
This should be good now.

3400
03:10:06,060 --> 03:10:08,700
Hold on, I'm gonna turn it down so it doesn't jump scare me.

3401
03:10:14,500 --> 03:10:15,480
There we go.

3402
03:10:16,660 --> 03:10:17,840
eBay jump scare.

3403
03:10:18,060 --> 03:10:20,880
I found these cute little patches of Kero-tan.

3404
03:10:29,710 --> 03:10:30,150
Yeah.

3405
03:10:35,470 --> 03:10:36,950
What was I saying before that?

3406
03:10:40,610 --> 03:10:42,190
What was I saying before that?

3407
03:10:44,450 --> 03:10:45,550
Don't make me cry.

3408
03:10:50,230 --> 03:10:51,590
Oh yeah, something about performing.

3409
03:10:51,730 --> 03:10:52,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3410
03:10:52,370 --> 03:10:53,570
So I used to perform a little bit.

3411
03:10:54,350 --> 03:10:54,810
Um...

3412
03:10:55,850 --> 03:10:56,710
And uh...

3413
03:10:57,170 --> 03:10:58,070
And um...

3414
03:10:58,070 --> 03:10:59,530
I would always sing Kirakirachun.

3415
03:11:00,310 --> 03:11:01,230
And um...

3416
03:11:01,230 --> 03:11:02,030
The old...

3417
03:11:02,030 --> 03:11:04,570
Yeah, cause I was talking about the song that I wanted to sing with a group of people.

3418
03:11:05,070 --> 03:11:05,530
Um...

3419
03:11:05,530 --> 03:11:07,470
When I would perform a little bit...

3420
03:11:07,470 --> 03:11:08,290
Um...

3421
03:11:08,290 --> 03:11:09,590
I would kinda go crazy.

3422
03:11:10,230 --> 03:11:10,690
Like...

3423
03:11:12,650 --> 03:11:13,110
Like...

3424
03:11:13,110 --> 03:11:13,750
Um...

3425
03:11:13,750 --> 03:11:16,890
Like, I'm the type that like feels the music, you know?

3426
03:11:16,930 --> 03:11:17,790
So like...

3427
03:11:17,790 --> 03:11:18,650
Um...

3428
03:11:19,170 --> 03:11:19,630
Like...

3429
03:11:19,630 --> 03:11:20,890
Stage diving...

3430
03:11:20,890 --> 03:11:22,890
Or rolling on the ground...

3431
03:11:22,890 --> 03:11:24,210
Or like climbing things...

3432
03:11:24,210 --> 03:11:25,090
Is nothing new to me.

3433
03:11:30,470 --> 03:11:30,990
But...

3434
03:11:30,990 --> 03:11:31,690
Um...

3435
03:11:31,690 --> 03:11:35,010
Not that I had like a huge enough crowd to stage dive into.

3436
03:11:36,730 --> 03:11:37,250
But...

3437
03:11:38,610 --> 03:11:40,250
Stuff similar like that...

3438
03:11:40,970 --> 03:11:42,430
We know you'd go crazy.

3439
03:11:42,430 --> 03:11:43,270
That goes without saying.

3440
03:11:43,930 --> 03:11:44,910
It's one of the...

3441
03:11:45,430 --> 03:11:45,950
Sad...

3442
03:11:45,950 --> 03:11:46,390
Um...

3443
03:11:46,390 --> 03:11:47,610
The sad...

3444
03:11:48,510 --> 03:11:52,390
Things about being a VTuber is that, you know, I'm stuck here digitally.

3445
03:11:52,890 --> 03:11:53,410
So...

3446
03:11:54,350 --> 03:11:55,870
I can never perform that well.

3447
03:11:55,870 --> 03:11:56,550
I can never get away with you guys.

3448
03:11:56,790 --> 03:11:57,390
But that's okay.

3449
03:11:58,790 --> 03:11:59,930
Just a little bit maybe.

3450
03:12:01,570 --> 03:12:02,490
Is that how you died?

3451
03:12:03,010 --> 03:12:03,630
I dunno.

3452
03:12:07,410 --> 03:12:07,850
Hmm...

3453
03:12:08,930 --> 03:12:10,090
Imagining Mint in a mosh pit?

3454
03:12:10,290 --> 03:12:10,690
Yeah!

3455
03:12:11,230 --> 03:12:11,910
I did!

3456
03:12:12,030 --> 03:12:12,410
I did!

3457
03:12:12,790 --> 03:12:14,270
There is some like um...

3458
03:12:14,770 --> 03:12:19,290
I very distinctly remember being in a mosh pit for an idol group called Passcode.

3459
03:12:20,850 --> 03:12:22,730
I didn't realize this was so short.

3460
03:12:22,950 --> 03:12:23,250
Hold on.

3461
03:12:23,390 --> 03:12:24,310
Denpa Gumi...

3462
03:12:25,330 --> 03:12:28,050
Maybe we don't do... let's see what other ones they have.

3463
03:12:28,210 --> 03:12:28,930
They have...

3464
03:12:28,930 --> 03:12:30,890
Oh, they have WW... wait, that one's even shorter.

3465
03:12:31,170 --> 03:12:32,850
Oh, this one's a whole playlist.

3466
03:12:43,360 --> 03:12:45,760
You guys, I've got a bit of a wild streak about me.

3467
03:12:46,640 --> 03:12:48,580
But I think it's just because I like passion.

3468
03:12:48,840 --> 03:12:51,240
And I like... so, you know, I find that...

3469
03:12:52,260 --> 03:12:53,700
That in like...

3470
03:12:55,680 --> 03:12:56,560
In like...

3471
03:12:57,440 --> 03:13:01,360
Idols like that or something, you'll get a lot of passionate, crazy things.

3472
03:13:01,520 --> 03:13:03,960
Like, you know, I don't care if they spit on me.

3473
03:13:04,140 --> 03:13:06,140
They're feeling it in the moment, you know?

3474
03:13:07,420 --> 03:13:09,060
Just throw the monitor in the crowd.

3475
03:13:09,160 --> 03:13:09,640
We get it.

3476
03:13:11,860 --> 03:13:14,340
Building you a robot body to stage dive with boss.

3477
03:13:15,820 --> 03:13:16,740
Oh my gosh.

3478
03:13:16,860 --> 03:13:17,080
Yay!

3479
03:13:21,740 --> 03:13:24,080
What are moshpets if not a big moment of passion?

3480
03:13:24,780 --> 03:13:25,220
Exactly!

3481
03:13:27,480 --> 03:13:29,760
I hope though you guys really like the karaoke.

3482
03:13:31,880 --> 03:13:33,780
Not all Vtubers play by that rule.

3483
03:13:33,900 --> 03:13:34,780
You're your own boss now.

3484
03:13:34,880 --> 03:13:35,500
Do what you like.

3485
03:13:35,780 --> 03:13:39,520
I like... I like being Vtuber.

3486
03:13:39,660 --> 03:13:42,920
I like being... on the screen.

3487
03:13:43,980 --> 03:13:45,280
So... that is...

3488
03:13:45,280 --> 03:13:47,020
That is where you'll see me.

3489
03:13:47,060 --> 03:13:48,040
Unless they build a robot.

3490
03:13:48,280 --> 03:13:50,180
Which someone said they're already working on it right now.

3491
03:13:50,260 --> 03:13:50,640
So...

3492
03:13:50,640 --> 03:13:52,820
I hope... I'll... I want it.

3493
03:13:56,240 --> 03:13:58,800
This is one of the songs I didn't sing, but this is the one that I...

3494
03:13:58,800 --> 03:14:00,640
That is my Kamiyoshi's graduation.

3495
03:14:14,620 --> 03:14:15,800
Make you a Gundam.

3496
03:14:15,840 --> 03:14:16,080
Yeah!

3497
03:14:16,680 --> 03:14:17,340
Oh my gosh.

3498
03:14:17,340 --> 03:14:18,600
Can you imagine a Gundam jumping?

3499
03:14:19,840 --> 03:14:21,940
It would have to be made of like cardboard.

3500
03:14:22,180 --> 03:14:23,960
If it's too heavy...

3501
03:14:26,800 --> 03:14:28,220
You'll be a robot at Ofukai.

3502
03:14:28,320 --> 03:14:28,900
We can carry you.

3503
03:14:28,960 --> 03:14:29,300
Yes!

3504
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:35,480
But I'm borrowing Vshojo's tech for that, so I don't know if they'll be very happy about that.

3505
03:14:42,300 --> 03:14:43,660
Dan, thank you for the 20 gifted!

3506
03:14:43,740 --> 03:14:44,220
Thank you!

3507
03:14:45,760 --> 03:14:47,860
You definitely could have virtually stave-dived yesterday.

3508
03:14:48,260 --> 03:14:50,540
I wonder if they could strap a camera on a daki.

3509
03:14:52,860 --> 03:14:53,760
That'd be awesome!

3510
03:14:56,980 --> 03:14:58,480
So excited to see you at Ofukai.

3511
03:14:58,560 --> 03:14:58,920
Me too!

3512
03:14:59,640 --> 03:15:01,840
I for once welcome our Mecha Mint Overlord.

3513
03:15:03,360 --> 03:15:03,760
Nanananananananana!

3514
03:15:03,780 --> 03:15:04,040
Chichi!

3515
03:15:04,300 --> 03:15:04,660
Pui!

3516
03:15:04,760 --> 03:15:05,060
Pui!

3517
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:12,060
This song, I only got to see...

3518
03:15:12,580 --> 03:15:12,940
No!

3519
03:15:13,120 --> 03:15:14,140
I got to see it live twice.

3520
03:15:14,660 --> 03:15:16,640
I got to see it in my last Japan trip.

3521
03:15:17,160 --> 03:15:18,380
I was so happy!

3522
03:15:18,780 --> 03:15:22,620
Oh my gosh, I was so happy to see Denpa last Japan trip.

3523
03:15:22,800 --> 03:15:23,320
I was...

3524
03:15:25,300 --> 03:15:27,240
It was so awesome.

3525
03:15:27,380 --> 03:15:30,040
It was just a mini live, so they only did a few songs, but...

3526
03:15:31,820 --> 03:15:34,520
But the first time I saw them ever was a release event.

3527
03:15:34,780 --> 03:15:36,340
Which is when they like, you know...

3528
03:15:37,060 --> 03:15:39,260
It is what it sounds like when they release a...

3529
03:15:39,260 --> 03:15:40,680
An album or a single.

3530
03:15:41,040 --> 03:15:42,500
In that case, it was an album.

3531
03:15:45,260 --> 03:15:49,100
And I got to take a cheki, my one and only cheki with my Kamiyoshi.

3532
03:15:50,140 --> 03:15:50,940
And um...

3533
03:15:52,140 --> 03:15:53,280
But I got to see them.

3534
03:15:53,400 --> 03:15:56,920
I could barely see them because I was way in the back and I...

3535
03:15:56,920 --> 03:15:57,520
Um...

3536
03:15:58,100 --> 03:15:58,500
I...

3537
03:15:59,040 --> 03:15:59,440
Uh...

3538
03:16:00,280 --> 03:16:04,460
There were many tall people around, but I could still feel their energy, so it was really great.

3539
03:16:05,900 --> 03:16:07,940
This was my first time hearing these songs with this group.

3540
03:16:07,940 --> 03:16:10,560
I love that it was more than just a karaoke, but stories about them as well.

3541
03:16:11,060 --> 03:16:12,940
Really got through how cool they were.

3542
03:16:13,420 --> 03:16:14,100
I'm glad!

3543
03:16:15,380 --> 03:16:16,200
I'm so happy!

3544
03:16:16,880 --> 03:16:18,960
Was the first time you saw them the six-person group?

3545
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:19,260
Yes!

3546
03:16:19,880 --> 03:16:21,840
Yes, so it was still the six of them.

3547
03:16:23,320 --> 03:16:23,720
Um...

3548
03:16:23,720 --> 03:16:24,480
I never...

3549
03:16:24,900 --> 03:16:29,560
I'll be honest, I didn't even know about Denpa Gumi when they were a five-person group, so...

3550
03:16:32,340 --> 03:16:34,540
I got into them when they were a six-person group.

3551
03:16:35,300 --> 03:16:35,700
Around...

3552
03:16:37,940 --> 03:16:39,740
This is another Psyche K song.

3553
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:40,660
When did...

3554
03:16:40,660 --> 03:16:41,240
Let's see...

3555
03:16:41,800 --> 03:16:43,680
Den Den Passion came out...

3556
03:16:43,680 --> 03:16:44,460
2013!

3557
03:16:45,620 --> 03:16:46,260
So!

3558
03:16:48,020 --> 03:16:49,900
I've known about them for...

3559
03:16:51,020 --> 03:16:51,660
For...

3560
03:16:51,660 --> 03:16:54,200
For over a decade!

3561
03:16:54,260 --> 03:16:55,020
I've been a fan!

3562
03:16:57,700 --> 03:16:58,020
Wow!

3563
03:16:59,920 --> 03:17:00,560
Yeah...

3564
03:17:02,740 --> 03:17:04,340
It's just a little bit over a decade.

3565
03:17:06,560 --> 03:17:07,200
So...

3566
03:17:07,200 --> 03:17:09,900
It's sad that I couldn't be around for all 16 years, but...

3567
03:17:12,620 --> 03:17:13,200
That's okay.

3568
03:17:13,960 --> 03:17:15,040
I still got to...

3569
03:17:15,040 --> 03:17:16,300
See them for...

3570
03:17:16,300 --> 03:17:18,120
Or, like, follow them for so long.

3571
03:17:18,440 --> 03:17:18,620
And...

3572
03:17:18,620 --> 03:17:20,400
Maybe later I can post some...

3573
03:17:20,400 --> 03:17:22,180
Pictures of, like, my...

3574
03:17:22,180 --> 03:17:23,660
Ina bag...

3575
03:17:23,660 --> 03:17:24,000
And...

3576
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:25,220
It's double-sided.

3577
03:17:28,180 --> 03:17:30,660
Back in the day, too, I used to be, like...

3578
03:17:30,660 --> 03:17:32,940
Not involved with Japanese fans, but...

3579
03:17:32,940 --> 03:17:34,600
I would talk with a few, and...

3580
03:17:34,600 --> 03:17:35,560
I had one...

3581
03:17:35,560 --> 03:17:37,060
One person drew some...

3582
03:17:37,060 --> 03:17:37,820
Nemu...

3583
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:39,880
Badges and stuff.

3584
03:17:40,120 --> 03:17:40,320
And...

3585
03:17:41,340 --> 03:17:43,020
And they sent them to me.

3586
03:17:43,120 --> 03:17:43,340
They...

3587
03:17:43,340 --> 03:17:45,200
Because I couldn't go to the event, so...

3588
03:17:45,200 --> 03:17:48,500
Should have gone with a tall, strong friend to climb on their shoulders.

3589
03:17:48,620 --> 03:17:49,200
I wish!

3590
03:17:49,920 --> 03:17:50,320
The...

3591
03:17:50,320 --> 03:17:50,500
Oh!

3592
03:17:50,740 --> 03:17:51,820
Another time...

3593
03:17:51,820 --> 03:17:52,640
Was...

3594
03:17:52,640 --> 03:17:53,920
That I saw Denpagumi...

3595
03:17:53,920 --> 03:17:55,280
Was also...

3596
03:17:55,860 --> 03:17:57,780
It was at Tokyo Idol Festival.

3597
03:17:58,040 --> 03:17:59,200
And I waited...

3598
03:17:59,200 --> 03:18:01,260
I waited about 8 hours...

3599
03:18:01,260 --> 03:18:02,400
In line...

3600
03:18:02,400 --> 03:18:03,660
Like, in the venue...

3601
03:18:03,660 --> 03:18:05,060
To get to the very front.

3602
03:18:05,360 --> 03:18:06,960
And I saw them...

3603
03:18:06,960 --> 03:18:07,040
And I saw them...

3604
03:18:07,660 --> 03:18:08,540
Front row!

3605
03:18:09,760 --> 03:18:10,520
Front row!

3606
03:18:10,620 --> 03:18:11,960
I got to see Denpagumi!

3607
03:18:14,040 --> 03:18:14,480
So...

3608
03:18:14,940 --> 03:18:15,820
It was...

3609
03:18:15,820 --> 03:18:16,500
It was a...

3610
03:18:16,500 --> 03:18:17,280
I, like...

3611
03:18:17,280 --> 03:18:18,600
Packed calorie mate...

3612
03:18:18,600 --> 03:18:19,600
In my bag...

3613
03:18:19,600 --> 03:18:19,880
And, like...

3614
03:18:19,880 --> 03:18:20,640
When I got hungry...

3615
03:18:20,640 --> 03:18:20,900
I would...

3616
03:18:20,900 --> 03:18:21,660
I would, like...

3617
03:18:21,660 --> 03:18:22,400
Bend down...

3618
03:18:22,400 --> 03:18:22,800
And I would...

3619
03:18:22,800 --> 03:18:23,940
Munch and munch and munch...

3620
03:18:23,940 --> 03:18:24,680
And then I would...

3621
03:18:25,460 --> 03:18:26,360
Stand back up...

3622
03:18:26,360 --> 03:18:27,240
And cheer for the other groups...

3623
03:18:27,240 --> 03:18:28,160
That were performing...

3624
03:18:28,160 --> 03:18:29,240
And then, eventually...

3625
03:18:29,240 --> 03:18:31,560
I scooted myself to the very, very front row...

3626
03:18:31,560 --> 03:18:32,960
And it was so...

3627
03:18:42,390 --> 03:18:43,270
8 hours...

3628
03:18:43,270 --> 03:18:43,490
Yeah!

3629
03:18:43,730 --> 03:18:44,050
8 hours...

3630
03:18:45,530 --> 03:18:45,930
Yeah...

3631
03:18:45,930 --> 03:18:46,470
I waited...

3632
03:18:46,470 --> 03:18:47,090
I was, like...

3633
03:18:47,090 --> 03:18:48,110
So determined...

3634
03:18:49,510 --> 03:18:49,910
Um...

3635
03:18:51,810 --> 03:18:52,210
So...

3636
03:18:52,870 --> 03:18:53,270
Ah!

3637
03:18:53,470 --> 03:18:54,610
It was so awesome...

3638
03:18:55,150 --> 03:18:55,950
And, um...

3639
03:18:55,950 --> 03:18:57,330
It was tiring...

3640
03:18:57,330 --> 03:18:58,110
I mean, like...

3641
03:18:58,110 --> 03:18:58,390
Because...

3642
03:18:58,390 --> 03:18:58,970
There was, like...

3643
03:18:58,970 --> 03:19:00,450
It was just so much energy...

3644
03:19:00,450 --> 03:19:01,150
Like...

3645
03:19:01,150 --> 03:19:01,410
Because...

3646
03:19:01,410 --> 03:19:02,730
From so many groups...

3647
03:19:03,250 --> 03:19:03,650
Um...

3648
03:19:03,650 --> 03:19:04,210
But...

3649
03:19:04,210 --> 03:19:05,030
It was a...

3650
03:19:05,030 --> 03:19:05,650
It was...

3651
03:19:05,650 --> 03:19:06,370
Honestly...

3652
03:19:06,370 --> 03:19:07,810
I would do it again in a heartbeat...

3653
03:19:07,810 --> 03:19:09,210
And, um...

3654
03:19:12,530 --> 03:19:12,930
Nanana...

3655
03:19:12,930 --> 03:19:13,650
Nanana...

3656
03:19:13,650 --> 03:19:14,030
Nanana...

3657
03:19:15,690 --> 03:19:16,130
Nanana...

3658
03:19:16,130 --> 03:19:17,050
Did I sing this one?

3659
03:19:19,720 --> 03:19:20,200
Nanana...

3660
03:19:20,200 --> 03:19:20,680
Nanana...

3661
03:19:20,680 --> 03:19:21,740
No, I wanted to sing this one...

3662
03:19:21,740 --> 03:19:22,020
This one's...

3663
03:19:22,020 --> 03:19:22,680
Kitto Kitto Ne!

3664
03:19:24,320 --> 03:19:24,800
Nanana...

3665
03:19:24,800 --> 03:19:25,380
Nanana...

3666
03:19:25,380 --> 03:19:25,920
Nanana...

3667
03:19:29,250 --> 03:19:30,250
But, um...

3668
03:19:34,850 --> 03:19:35,330
Uh...

3669
03:19:35,330 --> 03:19:35,810
Yeah...

3670
03:19:35,810 --> 03:19:36,850
So, I saw them then...

3671
03:19:36,850 --> 03:19:38,590
I saw them...

3672
03:19:40,070 --> 03:19:41,030
Last trip...

3673
03:19:41,030 --> 03:19:42,010
So, that's three...

3674
03:19:42,570 --> 03:19:44,370
And then, I saw my Kami Oshi...

3675
03:19:46,190 --> 03:19:48,550
I saw my Kami Oshi perform...

3676
03:19:48,550 --> 03:19:50,070
In her, like...

3677
03:19:50,070 --> 03:19:50,410
Thing...

3678
03:19:50,410 --> 03:19:50,790
It was...

3679
03:19:50,790 --> 03:19:52,410
There were some Denpa members there, too...

3680
03:19:52,410 --> 03:19:52,630
But...

3681
03:19:52,630 --> 03:19:54,070
The Denpa-gubin didn't perform...

3682
03:19:54,070 --> 03:19:54,350
At that time...

3683
03:19:55,210 --> 03:19:56,590
So, that's four times...

3684
03:19:57,270 --> 03:19:57,750
Um...

3685
03:19:57,750 --> 03:19:58,950
Four times, I got to see...

3686
03:19:58,950 --> 03:20:00,310
Them, basically...

3687
03:20:00,310 --> 03:20:02,470
Thank you for introducing me to all these Denpa-gumi songs...

3688
03:20:02,470 --> 03:20:03,450
Wish I knew of them earlier...

3689
03:20:03,450 --> 03:20:05,170
But, definitely gonna dive into the rabbit hole tonight...

3690
03:20:05,770 --> 03:20:06,250
Yeah...

3691
03:20:08,830 --> 03:20:09,310
Yeah...

3692
03:20:11,010 --> 03:20:11,490
So...

3693
03:20:11,970 --> 03:20:12,450
Um...

3694
03:20:13,250 --> 03:20:13,730
Every...

3695
03:20:13,730 --> 03:20:14,690
Every time before...

3696
03:20:14,690 --> 03:20:14,970
Like...

3697
03:20:14,970 --> 03:20:15,390
I just...

3698
03:20:15,390 --> 03:20:15,650
Like...

3699
03:20:15,650 --> 03:20:16,090
You know...

3700
03:20:16,090 --> 03:20:16,390
It's...

3701
03:20:16,390 --> 03:20:17,310
It's expensive...

3702
03:20:18,210 --> 03:20:18,690
So...

3703
03:20:19,230 --> 03:20:19,710
Couldn't...

3704
03:20:19,710 --> 03:20:20,090
Uh...

3705
03:20:21,390 --> 03:20:21,870
Couldn't...

3706
03:20:21,870 --> 03:20:22,230
Uh...

3707
03:20:22,230 --> 03:20:22,990
Go...

3708
03:20:22,990 --> 03:20:23,610
But, that's okay...

3709
03:20:23,610 --> 03:20:24,330
Um...

3710
03:20:25,690 --> 03:20:26,830
Still got to see them...

3711
03:20:26,830 --> 03:20:27,050
And...

3712
03:20:27,050 --> 03:20:27,430
You know...

3713
03:20:27,430 --> 03:20:28,990
Sometimes, some people never get to see...

3714
03:20:28,990 --> 03:20:29,730
Their...

3715
03:20:30,190 --> 03:20:30,390
Their...

3716
03:20:30,390 --> 03:20:31,370
Favorite idols...

3717
03:20:31,370 --> 03:20:31,950
Live...

3718
03:20:31,950 --> 03:20:32,490
Or anything...

3719
03:20:32,490 --> 03:20:32,890
So...

3720
03:20:32,890 --> 03:20:33,590
I...

3721
03:20:34,290 --> 03:20:34,690
Um...

3722
03:20:34,690 --> 03:20:36,310
Very lucky...

3723
03:20:40,710 --> 03:20:42,630
This was a nice karaoke to wake up to!

3724
03:20:42,710 --> 03:20:44,050
I always love seeing your passion for idols!

3725
03:20:44,130 --> 03:20:45,490
I wish Denpa-gumi idols and fans...

3726
03:20:45,490 --> 03:20:46,590
Nothing but the best!

3727
03:20:47,230 --> 03:20:48,030
Thanks, Chilliaks!

3728
03:20:48,390 --> 03:20:49,310
Are you still in Japan?

3729
03:20:51,650 --> 03:20:52,510
Go to Deer Stage!

3730
03:20:53,610 --> 03:20:54,010
Um...

3731
03:20:54,010 --> 03:20:54,310
Um...

3732
03:20:54,310 --> 03:20:55,170
Thank you!

3733
03:20:55,250 --> 03:20:56,890
Thank you for introducing me to Denpa-gumi Inc!

3734
03:20:57,150 --> 03:20:58,170
This was a beautiful stream...

3735
03:20:58,170 --> 03:20:58,990
Thank you for singing with...

3736
03:20:58,990 --> 03:20:59,750
For us today...

3737
03:20:59,750 --> 03:21:00,950
Thank you...

3738
03:21:02,290 --> 03:21:02,650
Yeah...

3739
03:21:05,790 --> 03:21:07,550
Actually, another idol that I really love...

3740
03:21:07,550 --> 03:21:08,390
Her name is Aonya...

3741
03:21:08,390 --> 03:21:09,610
She was a part of...

3742
03:21:09,610 --> 03:21:09,950
Um...

3743
03:21:09,950 --> 03:21:11,650
She was a part of Denpa for a little bit...

3744
03:21:11,650 --> 03:21:13,630
But now, she's a part of Arcana Project...

3745
03:21:13,630 --> 03:21:15,530
I'm in Yokohama right now...

3746
03:21:15,530 --> 03:21:16,090
Hahaha...

3747
03:21:31,120 --> 03:21:31,960
What is this one?

3748
03:21:33,020 --> 03:21:33,380
Oh...

3749
03:21:36,140 --> 03:21:37,060
Phantom of the Kill...

3750
03:21:37,660 --> 03:21:38,620
I actually don't...

3751
03:21:38,620 --> 03:21:39,040
Um...

3752
03:21:39,040 --> 03:21:39,960
Know this one as well...

3753
03:21:39,960 --> 03:21:40,580
Um...

3754
03:21:43,040 --> 03:21:45,960
I got to see Arcana Project in Shizuoka a little while ago...

3755
03:21:45,960 --> 03:21:46,480
It was pretty fun...

3756
03:21:46,480 --> 03:21:47,500
They're so great...

3757
03:21:47,500 --> 03:21:47,940
They're power...

3758
03:21:47,940 --> 03:21:48,460
They're like a...

3759
03:21:50,360 --> 03:21:51,240
Vocal powerhouse...

3760
03:21:52,680 --> 03:21:54,180
How do places like Deer Stage work?

3761
03:21:54,400 --> 03:21:56,300
You do just go there, get a ticket, and go inside?

3762
03:21:57,240 --> 03:21:57,680
Um...

3763
03:21:57,680 --> 03:22:00,920
I would first check the Twitter, because some...

3764
03:22:01,460 --> 03:22:01,900
Some...

3765
03:22:02,520 --> 03:22:02,740
Uh...

3766
03:22:02,740 --> 03:22:04,020
Dates are...

3767
03:22:05,040 --> 03:22:07,120
Are ticketed, so you can't go...

3768
03:22:07,920 --> 03:22:08,560
But, uh...

3769
03:22:08,560 --> 03:22:09,300
Typically...

3770
03:22:09,980 --> 03:22:10,420
Um...

3771
03:22:10,580 --> 03:22:11,220
If it's like...

3772
03:22:11,220 --> 03:22:13,420
But there are also special events where you can...

3773
03:22:13,420 --> 03:22:14,120
Um...

3774
03:22:14,120 --> 03:22:14,760
Still...

3775
03:22:14,760 --> 03:22:15,580
Just go...

3776
03:22:16,180 --> 03:22:16,740
Um...

3777
03:22:16,740 --> 03:22:17,220
But it...

3778
03:22:17,220 --> 03:22:18,060
Like on their Twitter...

3779
03:22:18,060 --> 03:22:19,040
On the Deer Stage Twitter...

3780
03:22:19,040 --> 03:22:19,760
It says...

3781
03:22:19,760 --> 03:22:20,080
Like...

3782
03:22:20,080 --> 03:22:20,740
They get...

3783
03:22:20,740 --> 03:22:22,520
They post a schedule for the week...

3784
03:22:22,520 --> 03:22:24,240
And it says if it's um...

3785
03:22:24,240 --> 03:22:26,980
Ticketed or not...

3786
03:22:31,800 --> 03:22:32,360
Um...

3787
03:22:34,360 --> 03:22:35,380
But uh...

3788
03:22:35,380 --> 03:22:36,640
But you can go...

3789
03:22:36,640 --> 03:22:37,380
You can go...

3790
03:22:37,380 --> 03:22:38,480
And um...

3791
03:22:38,480 --> 03:22:38,940
Uh...

3792
03:22:38,940 --> 03:22:39,340
Basically...

3793
03:22:39,340 --> 03:22:39,800
So...

3794
03:22:39,800 --> 03:22:40,400
The base...

3795
03:22:40,400 --> 03:22:41,140
There's three floors...

3796
03:22:41,140 --> 03:22:41,940
The base floor...

3797
03:22:41,940 --> 03:22:42,700
Is...

3798
03:22:42,700 --> 03:22:43,240
Uh...

3799
03:22:43,240 --> 03:22:44,080
Is the theater...

3800
03:22:44,080 --> 03:22:44,760
So...

3801
03:22:44,760 --> 03:22:46,380
You can pay a thousand yen...

3802
03:22:46,380 --> 03:22:47,820
Just to watch the show...

3803
03:22:47,820 --> 03:22:48,260
They do...

3804
03:22:48,260 --> 03:22:49,300
About three shows...

3805
03:22:50,060 --> 03:22:50,460
Um...

3806
03:22:50,460 --> 03:22:51,140
A night...

3807
03:22:52,020 --> 03:22:53,220
The second floor...

3808
03:22:53,220 --> 03:22:54,380
Is a cafe...

3809
03:22:54,380 --> 03:22:55,000
Um...

3810
03:22:55,000 --> 03:22:55,900
If there's no one...

3811
03:22:55,900 --> 03:22:56,860
If you wanna watch a show...

3812
03:22:56,860 --> 03:22:57,740
And there's no one around...

3813
03:22:57,740 --> 03:22:58,420
On the first floor...

3814
03:22:58,420 --> 03:22:59,260
Go to the second floor...

3815
03:22:59,260 --> 03:22:59,800
And say like...

3816
03:22:59,800 --> 03:23:00,180
Oh...

3817
03:23:00,180 --> 03:23:02,180
You can either go and stay at the cafe...

3818
03:23:02,180 --> 03:23:02,900
Or you can be like...

3819
03:23:02,900 --> 03:23:03,300
I...

3820
03:23:03,300 --> 03:23:03,860
Uh...

3821
03:23:04,620 --> 03:23:05,020
I...

3822
03:23:05,560 --> 03:23:05,960
Um...

3823
03:23:05,960 --> 03:23:08,340
I want to watch the show on the first floor...

3824
03:23:08,340 --> 03:23:09,800
And you can just pay your thousand yen...

3825
03:23:09,800 --> 03:23:10,100
And then...

3826
03:23:10,100 --> 03:23:11,860
You can leave and come back too...

3827
03:23:11,860 --> 03:23:12,260
Um...

3828
03:23:12,260 --> 03:23:12,960
So if you're just like...

3829
03:23:12,960 --> 03:23:13,300
I'm gonna...

3830
03:23:13,300 --> 03:23:14,420
Gonna go and like...

3831
03:23:14,980 --> 03:23:15,280
Get...

3832
03:23:15,280 --> 03:23:16,080
Uh...

3833
03:23:16,080 --> 03:23:17,960
Some food at the konbini across the street...

3834
03:23:17,960 --> 03:23:18,900
You can go do that...

3835
03:23:19,840 --> 03:23:20,440
Um...

3836
03:23:22,640 --> 03:23:23,760
But uh...

3837
03:23:23,760 --> 03:23:25,880
And then the third floor is the bar...

3838
03:23:25,880 --> 03:23:26,680
Um...

3839
03:23:26,680 --> 03:23:27,760
And uh...

3840
03:23:27,760 --> 03:23:28,060
I...

3841
03:23:28,060 --> 03:23:29,040
Believe...

3842
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:29,460
Each...

3843
03:23:29,460 --> 03:23:30,200
Each floor...

3844
03:23:30,200 --> 03:23:30,680
The...

3845
03:23:30,680 --> 03:23:31,140
Um...

3846
03:23:31,140 --> 03:23:32,000
The cafe...

3847
03:23:32,000 --> 03:23:32,560
And the...

3848
03:23:32,560 --> 03:23:34,240
The bar...

3849
03:23:34,240 --> 03:23:34,780
Both have...

3850
03:23:34,780 --> 03:23:35,500
Service fees...

3851
03:23:36,640 --> 03:23:37,240
Oh...

3852
03:23:37,240 --> 03:23:38,040
This is not bocce...

3853
03:23:38,040 --> 03:23:38,340
Oh...

3854
03:23:38,860 --> 03:23:39,460
This is not bocce...

3855
03:23:41,340 --> 03:23:41,940
Oh...

3856
03:23:44,940 --> 03:23:45,240
This is not bocce...

3857
03:23:45,260 --> 03:23:45,580
Yeah.

3858
03:23:45,700 --> 03:23:47,200
Starco Bomb is right by the...

3859
03:23:47,200 --> 03:23:48,120
Right down the street too.

3860
03:23:48,260 --> 03:23:48,600
So...

3861
03:23:49,040 --> 03:23:49,300
Yeah.

3862
03:23:49,760 --> 03:23:51,940
Thank you for introducing me to all these Dempa songs.

3863
03:23:52,020 --> 03:23:53,920
Definitely keen to listen to more.

3864
03:23:54,080 --> 03:23:55,480
Amazing karaoke mint...

3865
03:23:56,260 --> 03:23:58,620
Sorry if I didn't do them justice...

3866
03:23:58,620 --> 03:23:59,640
But...

3867
03:24:01,020 --> 03:24:02,060
Nananana nanana...

3868
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:03,880
Nanananana nanana...

3869
03:24:03,880 --> 03:24:04,340
Nananana nanana...

3870
03:24:04,340 --> 03:24:08,280
I was part of a nine-man raid on Deerstage before FES.

3871
03:24:09,240 --> 03:24:12,060
We kind of overwhelmed the girls but it was a great time!

3872
03:24:12,480 --> 03:24:12,920
Hahaha!

3873
03:24:13,980 --> 03:24:15,160
Oh my god!

3874
03:24:15,160 --> 03:24:16,240
Oh my gosh, you guys are crazy!

3875
03:24:17,420 --> 03:24:24,380
Yeah, when I've gone past a couple times, they're just like, Wow, there's so many more foreigners coming recently.

3876
03:24:24,760 --> 03:24:25,780
And I'm just like, really?

3877
03:24:26,400 --> 03:24:27,300
I wonder why.

3878
03:24:29,360 --> 03:24:30,580
I wonder why.

3879
03:24:33,780 --> 03:24:34,920
But it's great.

3880
03:24:35,020 --> 03:24:36,800
I'm glad that more people are going to Deer Stage.

3881
03:24:37,160 --> 03:24:42,440
Especially with Denpogumi disbanding, I'm really worried.

3882
03:24:42,440 --> 03:24:48,760
But they do have some other popular groups in collaboration with another company called Perfect Music.

3883
03:24:48,980 --> 03:24:52,400
So right now you see DSPM, it means Deer Stage Perfect Music.

3884
03:24:54,260 --> 03:24:57,080
But I am still kind of... I am a little worried.

3885
03:25:00,600 --> 03:25:04,920
They survived the pandemic, which was so awesome.

3886
03:25:05,100 --> 03:25:06,280
I'm so grateful for that.

3887
03:25:09,160 --> 03:25:10,280
I think...

3888
03:25:12,440 --> 03:25:19,280
It's like the perfect place to experience true Akiba culture as it is now.

3889
03:25:22,340 --> 03:25:23,820
Oh my gosh!

3890
03:25:24,120 --> 03:25:24,920
Welcome to membership!

3891
03:25:25,200 --> 03:25:25,880
Thank you!

3892
03:25:27,340 --> 03:25:28,720
Thank you so much!

3893
03:25:29,800 --> 03:25:31,020
I love all your art.

3894
03:25:31,100 --> 03:25:31,600
Thank you!

3895
03:25:36,190 --> 03:25:37,180
I do...

3896
03:25:38,140 --> 03:25:39,180
I've ordered...

3897
03:25:39,180 --> 03:25:41,780
I haven't ordered since...

3898
03:25:42,680 --> 03:25:43,840
Engaging had broken up.

3899
03:25:43,860 --> 03:25:46,300
I had stopped ordering a bunch of stuff.

3900
03:25:46,500 --> 03:25:46,840
But...

3901
03:25:46,840 --> 03:25:52,920
I ordered some Aonion stuff when she was in Denpogumi.

3902
03:25:53,040 --> 03:25:54,700
And I ordered some of her stuff too.

3903
03:25:58,400 --> 03:26:02,240
As Arcana and other groups that I like.

3904
03:26:02,540 --> 03:26:02,980
So...

3905
03:26:04,520 --> 03:26:05,080
No,

3906
03:26:12,200 --> 03:26:13,000
not this song!

3907
03:26:15,660 --> 03:26:16,160
But...

3908
03:26:17,960 --> 03:26:18,460
Yeah...

3909
03:26:22,720 --> 03:26:26,180
It's weird to like, you know, be so sad when they've been around for so long.

3910
03:26:26,480 --> 03:26:26,800
But...

3911
03:26:27,840 --> 03:26:29,360
Aonion is very squished cheeks.

3912
03:26:30,560 --> 03:26:33,060
I really like Kyurushite from Deer Stage.

3913
03:26:33,160 --> 03:26:33,640
Yes!

3914
03:26:33,860 --> 03:26:36,520
Kyurushite is one of their like really popular groups right now.

3915
03:26:36,660 --> 03:26:37,040
So...

3916
03:26:37,860 --> 03:26:39,900
Kyurushite is very popular.

3917
03:26:40,160 --> 03:26:42,760
So that's why I'm like not entirely worried.

3918
03:26:42,920 --> 03:26:43,680
But, you know...

3919
03:26:43,680 --> 03:26:44,540
I don't know.

3920
03:26:44,540 --> 03:26:45,660
I still want them to do well.

3921
03:26:45,960 --> 03:26:46,100
And...

3922
03:26:47,200 --> 03:26:48,060
They've like...

3923
03:26:48,060 --> 03:26:52,120
There have been some groups that like formed and then disbanded shortly after.

3924
03:26:53,680 --> 03:26:54,200
So...

3925
03:26:54,200 --> 03:26:55,800
You know...

3926
03:26:55,800 --> 03:26:56,800
Just stuff like that.

3927
03:26:59,180 --> 03:27:00,220
Not weird at all?

3928
03:27:05,010 --> 03:27:06,770
I feel the Aonion fairies.

3929
03:27:09,550 --> 03:27:12,290
I hope we don't lose any more Akiba culture.

3930
03:27:12,510 --> 03:27:12,970
Me too.

3931
03:27:13,970 --> 03:27:14,490
Yeah...

3932
03:27:16,290 --> 03:27:18,250
Especially, you know...

3933
03:27:18,250 --> 03:27:21,270
Tenpa really kept the Akiba culture alive for me.

3934
03:27:26,980 --> 03:27:28,080
It's not dying.

3935
03:27:29,140 --> 03:27:30,100
It's not dead.

3936
03:27:31,360 --> 03:27:33,540
You know, Tenpa's legacy will be around.

3937
03:27:43,760 --> 03:27:44,400
But...

3938
03:27:48,100 --> 03:27:49,260
I think...

3939
03:27:49,260 --> 03:27:49,720
I think...

3940
03:27:53,850 --> 03:27:54,570
Uhhh...

3941
03:27:55,410 --> 03:27:56,130
Uhh...

3942
03:27:58,090 --> 03:27:59,890
I have like some other...

3943
03:28:01,630 --> 03:28:06,330
Like, more personal things about them disbanding too.

3944
03:28:06,490 --> 03:28:09,850
This is like very much end of a era.

3945
03:28:11,510 --> 03:28:14,150
I had a friend that she...

3946
03:28:14,150 --> 03:28:16,770
And I loved Tenpa together.

3947
03:28:17,190 --> 03:28:17,390
And...

3948
03:28:17,390 --> 03:28:20,270
You know...

3949
03:28:20,270 --> 03:28:20,770
She...

3950
03:28:20,770 --> 03:28:22,150
Uhh...

3951
03:28:22,150 --> 03:28:22,630
Just...

3952
03:28:22,630 --> 03:28:39,450
She was not a ghost and unfortunately she passed away last year and so I kind of will be thinking of her and everything.

3953
03:28:39,810 --> 03:28:48,790
So I thought of her a lot with the disbandment.

3954
03:29:08,390 --> 03:29:09,290
This was fun!

3955
03:29:10,050 --> 03:29:12,250
Thank you guys for even being here.

3956
03:29:12,290 --> 03:29:15,070
Thank you for indulging me in this

3957
03:29:18,840 --> 03:29:23,740
selfish karaoke of mine.

3958
03:29:36,070 --> 03:29:38,910
Definitely check out the songs that I sang and more.

3959
03:29:39,110 --> 03:29:42,410
They have so many more amazing songs that I didn't even touch.

3960
03:29:43,870 --> 03:29:46,990
I recommend, like I said, they have an album if you want to check it out.

3961
03:29:46,990 --> 03:29:55,290
Like a base kind of... base to follow.

3962
03:29:55,530 --> 03:30:01,170
The WWDBest has all their initial bangers and they have so many more good songs.

3963
03:30:03,610 --> 03:30:04,230
Oh!

3964
03:30:04,430 --> 03:30:10,350
I was going to share my... I didn't finish my schedule.

3965
03:30:10,790 --> 03:30:12,490
Oh no!

3966
03:30:16,990 --> 03:30:19,130
I didn't finish my schedule for this week, you guys, but I can give you a preview.

3967
03:30:21,330 --> 03:30:22,390
I can give you a preview.

3968
03:30:24,750 --> 03:30:28,590
So tomorrow, as usual... hold on, let me do this.

3969
03:30:37,500 --> 03:30:37,880
Screenshot.

3970
03:30:40,400 --> 03:30:42,660
And the times... oh wait, the times aren't right either.

3971
03:30:42,960 --> 03:30:43,380
Oh no!

3972
03:30:43,880 --> 03:30:44,500
Oh no!

3973
03:30:45,400 --> 03:30:46,100
Okay, I'm...

3974
03:30:46,720 --> 03:30:48,720
Okay, I'm only going to show you...

3975
03:30:48,720 --> 03:30:49,400
Okay, I'm only going to show you...

3976
03:30:49,800 --> 03:30:52,560
I'm only going to show you what's on the days.

3977
03:30:57,060 --> 03:30:58,540
And what streams I have.

3978
03:31:00,960 --> 03:31:01,880
Ignore the times!

3979
03:31:02,440 --> 03:31:03,180
Ignore the times!

3980
03:31:03,240 --> 03:31:04,400
In fact, I'm just going to cross them out.

3981
03:31:05,480 --> 03:31:06,880
I'm going to cross them out.

3982
03:31:06,960 --> 03:31:07,560
I'll fix them later.

3983
03:31:08,320 --> 03:31:09,480
I have actual times.

3984
03:31:11,160 --> 03:31:11,980
I'll post it.

3985
03:31:12,420 --> 03:31:13,820
I've got to finish my schedule.

3986
03:31:15,380 --> 03:31:16,460
I've got to finish my schedule.

3987
03:31:18,280 --> 03:31:19,300
I've got to finish my schedule.

3988
03:31:19,980 --> 03:31:21,560
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

3989
03:31:22,180 --> 03:31:22,700
Sorry.

3990
03:31:30,920 --> 03:31:31,440
Zombina!

3991
03:31:31,780 --> 03:31:33,760
I love this song so much.

3992
03:31:33,820 --> 03:31:36,120
They have like a Christmas theme song and a...

3993
03:31:37,520 --> 03:31:39,460
And a Halloween song.

3994
03:31:39,560 --> 03:31:40,640
And this is the Halloween one.

3995
03:31:48,940 --> 03:31:49,460
Zombina!

3996
03:31:49,460 --> 03:31:50,760
Okay, so...

3997
03:31:50,760 --> 03:31:53,300
Of course, Monday is Mintara Monday.

3998
03:31:53,500 --> 03:31:55,800
So the podcast will be released and I won't be streaming.

3999
03:31:56,020 --> 03:31:58,620
But Tuesday, I have a Helldivers 2 collab.

4000
03:31:58,980 --> 03:32:00,560
With Mintara, Hanyu, and Haruka!

4001
03:32:01,060 --> 03:32:01,220
Woo!

4002
03:32:02,660 --> 03:32:04,640
And maybe only I'm watching you for a few weeks.

4003
03:32:04,740 --> 03:32:08,100
I can already tell you're the best when talking about the things you love.

4004
03:32:10,440 --> 03:32:11,380
You're a good boy!

4005
03:32:12,960 --> 03:32:13,940
Thank you for...

4006
03:32:14,660 --> 03:32:15,380
Thank you!

4007
03:32:15,720 --> 03:32:16,380
Thank you.

4008
03:32:16,460 --> 03:32:17,200
Thank you for...

4009
03:32:17,200 --> 03:32:17,960
I don't know why...

4010
03:32:17,960 --> 03:32:19,500
I'm compelled to say this.

4011
03:32:19,840 --> 03:32:21,060
But thank you for...

4012
03:32:21,880 --> 03:32:22,340
Sending...

4013
03:32:22,340 --> 03:32:22,760
Um...

4014
03:32:22,760 --> 03:32:24,640
Sending your message...

4015
03:32:24,640 --> 03:32:26,220
When I can actually read it.

4016
03:32:26,440 --> 03:32:31,820
I don't know why I feel compelled to say that.

4017
03:32:33,260 --> 03:32:34,740
Thank you so much for the Aka Silva!

4018
03:32:35,060 --> 03:32:35,640
Thank you.

4019
03:32:35,960 --> 03:32:38,300
But yeah, I'm collabing with Mintara, Hanyu, and Haruka.

4020
03:32:38,580 --> 03:32:39,380
On Tuesday.

4021
03:32:39,820 --> 03:32:41,520
Wednesday is Bunny Garden.

4022
03:32:41,860 --> 03:32:42,960
Which is a...

4023
03:32:42,960 --> 03:32:44,540
The newest Q-Rate game.

4024
03:32:44,740 --> 03:32:47,400
Which, if you guys don't know Q-Rate, I love Q-Rate.

4025
03:32:47,400 --> 03:32:48,920
Oh my gosh, I love their games so much.

4026
03:32:49,100 --> 03:32:50,180
They have like...

4027
03:32:50,180 --> 03:32:53,040
There's another game I want to play by them called Maid of the Dead.

4028
03:32:53,180 --> 03:32:53,760
Which just...

4029
03:32:54,420 --> 03:32:55,760
Sounds perfect for me, right?

4030
03:32:55,840 --> 03:32:56,400
It's a zombie...

4031
03:32:56,940 --> 03:32:57,140
Um...

4032
03:32:57,140 --> 03:32:57,960
Oh, not zombie.

4033
03:32:58,020 --> 03:32:59,380
A vampire survivor type game.

4034
03:33:01,260 --> 03:33:01,640
Um...

4035
03:33:01,640 --> 03:33:03,040
But yeah, Q-Rate...

4036
03:33:03,040 --> 03:33:04,180
Hold on, let me...

4037
03:33:04,180 --> 03:33:04,880
Q...

4038
03:33:04,880 --> 03:33:05,400
Oh, no.

4039
03:33:05,620 --> 03:33:06,000
Um...

4040
03:33:06,440 --> 03:33:06,820
Bunny...

4041
03:33:06,820 --> 03:33:07,840
Bunny Garden.

4042
03:33:10,360 --> 03:33:11,060
Where is it?

4043
03:33:11,140 --> 03:33:11,440
Whoa.

4044
03:33:12,020 --> 03:33:12,400
Bunny?

4045
03:33:16,470 --> 03:33:17,650
Why isn't it showing up?

4046
03:33:17,970 --> 03:33:18,470
Uh-oh.

4047
03:33:21,230 --> 03:33:22,190
It was...

4048
03:33:22,190 --> 03:33:22,210
It was...

4049
03:33:22,210 --> 03:33:22,410
It was...

4050
03:33:22,410 --> 03:33:22,790
It was...

4051
03:33:23,670 --> 03:33:24,150
It was...

4052
03:33:24,150 --> 03:33:26,230
Wait, why isn't any of the Q-Rate stuff showing up?

4053
03:33:28,590 --> 03:33:29,070
Um...

4054
03:33:29,070 --> 03:33:29,910
But also...

4055
03:33:29,910 --> 03:33:31,450
They did like...

4056
03:33:31,450 --> 03:33:33,090
Some spooky like...

4057
03:33:33,090 --> 03:33:36,170
Escape from Izanami Hotel and things like that.

4058
03:33:37,030 --> 03:33:37,510
Um...

4059
03:33:38,310 --> 03:33:40,610
I was wondering when HENYA collab was gonna happen.

4060
03:33:41,290 --> 03:33:41,970
Don't worry!

4061
03:33:43,230 --> 03:33:45,130
We still plan on collabing.

4062
03:33:47,050 --> 03:33:48,250
I'm still working on it.

4063
03:33:48,310 --> 03:33:48,470
Okay.

4064
03:33:48,650 --> 03:33:49,230
I'm gonna...

4065
03:33:49,230 --> 03:33:49,830
I'm working on it.

4066
03:33:52,050 --> 03:33:54,170
Your Steam is not set to show adult games?

4067
03:33:54,310 --> 03:33:55,350
No, I saw it earlier.

4068
03:33:57,850 --> 03:33:58,490
I'm gonna...

4069
03:33:58,490 --> 03:33:59,330
Maid of the Dead.

4070
03:33:59,550 --> 03:33:59,930
Okay.

4071
03:34:00,010 --> 03:34:01,450
If I search it...

4072
03:34:08,350 --> 03:34:09,730
Okay, there's Bunny Garden.

4073
03:34:11,590 --> 03:34:12,470
And, um...

4074
03:34:12,470 --> 03:34:14,330
Thursday, I'm still deciding what I wanna do.

4075
03:34:14,430 --> 03:34:17,070
Friday, we're going to do a tour of Akihabara!

4076
03:34:17,970 --> 03:34:18,410
Yippee!

4077
03:34:18,750 --> 03:34:19,190
So...

4078
03:34:19,190 --> 03:34:19,210
Um...

4079
03:34:19,210 --> 03:34:25,010
So, if you're curious more about Deer Stage and Akihabara in general, I'll show you, um...

4080
03:34:25,910 --> 03:34:29,290
Some places that I go to and frequent and...

4081
03:34:29,290 --> 03:34:31,130
Well, not frequent, but you know...

4082
03:34:33,010 --> 03:34:33,570
Um...

4083
03:34:33,570 --> 03:34:34,010
So...

4084
03:34:34,570 --> 03:34:36,330
We'll do an Akiba tour on Friday.

4085
03:34:36,570 --> 03:34:37,110
Um...

4086
03:34:37,110 --> 03:34:38,710
Saturday, I will be out haunting.

4087
03:34:38,990 --> 03:34:40,250
And Sunday...

4088
03:34:40,250 --> 03:34:40,810
Um...

4089
03:34:40,810 --> 03:34:41,950
I haven't decided what I'm doing yet.

4090
03:34:42,350 --> 03:34:42,910
So...

4091
03:34:42,910 --> 03:34:43,250
Um...

4092
03:34:44,150 --> 03:34:45,270
That is...

4093
03:34:45,990 --> 03:34:47,690
That is the...

4094
03:34:47,690 --> 03:34:48,790
The...

4095
03:34:48,790 --> 03:34:49,190
The...

4096
03:34:49,210 --> 03:34:49,890
Week...

4097
03:34:50,990 --> 03:34:51,390
Ish.

4098
03:34:51,990 --> 03:34:52,390
Ish.

4099
03:34:55,590 --> 03:34:56,330
Oh my gosh.

4100
03:34:56,510 --> 03:34:57,690
I've been blushing this whole time.

4101
03:35:02,880 --> 03:35:03,440
Take care!

4102
03:35:04,980 --> 03:35:06,400
This is from, uh...

4103
03:35:07,280 --> 03:35:08,080
Gudugudu Fairies.

4104
03:35:08,100 --> 03:35:08,520
Oh my gosh.

4105
03:35:15,180 --> 03:35:20,100
Gotta do my first trip to Japan back at the end of March, but sadly didn't get to spend much time exploring Akiba.

4106
03:35:20,260 --> 03:35:20,900
Next time!

4107
03:35:20,960 --> 03:35:21,120
Yeah!

4108
03:35:21,300 --> 03:35:21,700
Akiba!

4109
03:35:21,800 --> 03:35:22,460
Next time!

4110
03:35:22,900 --> 03:35:23,840
Thank you for the very best!

4111
03:35:23,860 --> 03:35:23,880
So fun!

4112
03:35:23,880 --> 03:35:24,440
My passion at karaoke!

4113
03:35:24,660 --> 03:35:25,580
Thank you, thank you!

4114
03:35:25,780 --> 03:35:26,340
Thank you!

4115
03:35:31,150 --> 03:35:31,630
Yeah...

4116
03:35:31,630 --> 03:35:32,150
So...

4117
03:35:32,150 --> 03:35:32,770
Um...

4118
03:35:34,170 --> 03:35:36,070
The streams might be shorter this week.

4119
03:35:36,150 --> 03:35:38,850
Just for some of them, like maybe...

4120
03:35:38,850 --> 03:35:40,330
Thursday and Sunday will be shorter...

4121
03:35:40,330 --> 03:35:41,090
Short, short streams.

4122
03:35:41,510 --> 03:35:47,950
So that I have more time to rest my voice, but since I didn't stream so much this week, this past week, I wanted to, uh...

4123
03:35:47,950 --> 03:35:49,830
Stream a little bit more.

4124
03:35:50,690 --> 03:35:51,170
So...

4125
03:35:51,170 --> 03:35:51,850
HMMMM....

4126
03:35:53,150 --> 03:35:53,630
Yes.

4127
03:35:53,690 --> 03:35:53,890
Yes.

4128
03:35:54,650 --> 03:35:55,370
Okie dokie.

4129
03:35:55,510 --> 03:35:55,790
A few things left to say.

4130
03:36:01,490 --> 03:36:04,310
Considering that you aren't in Japan anymore, is it perhaps with HiGuy?

4131
03:36:04,510 --> 03:36:06,290
No, it's just gonna be on Google Maps.

4132
03:36:09,920 --> 03:36:12,360
Nothing so fancy like an actual tour tour.

4133
03:36:12,480 --> 03:36:14,800
Maybe one day I can do that with you guys, but...

4134
03:36:17,460 --> 03:36:20,240
But I... I mean, not me.

4135
03:36:20,340 --> 03:36:21,400
I wouldn't be doing it.

4136
03:36:21,420 --> 03:36:24,720
Maybe like someone leads around and I say like, Hey, go here!

4137
03:36:24,960 --> 03:36:25,880
Hey, go here!

4138
03:36:25,980 --> 03:36:30,920
But for this, I will be showing you through Google Maps and showing you some places, so...

4139
03:36:30,920 --> 03:36:31,860
Yeah, sorry.

4140
03:36:32,020 --> 03:36:33,020
Sorry that it's not...

4141
03:36:35,300 --> 03:36:35,820
Not...

4142
03:36:39,400 --> 03:36:39,920
Actually...

4143
03:36:40,740 --> 03:36:41,540
Me there.

4144
03:36:43,760 --> 03:36:44,800
That's a good idea!

4145
03:36:45,600 --> 03:36:46,820
I'm gonna set it up.

4146
03:36:47,060 --> 03:36:48,060
I do now!

4147
03:36:51,600 --> 03:36:52,120
With...

4148
03:36:53,320 --> 03:36:53,840
EyeTracker...

4149
03:36:53,900 --> 03:36:54,180
EyeTracker...

4150
03:36:59,780 --> 03:37:02,560
We can have the EyeTracker for the bunny garden, yeah.

4151
03:37:02,900 --> 03:37:04,420
Halloween Akiba Ghost Tours.

4152
03:37:04,480 --> 03:37:06,120
Just possess a made tour guide.

4153
03:37:07,800 --> 03:37:08,300
Perfect.

4154
03:37:08,580 --> 03:37:10,480
Also, love the profile picture, CurryNinja.

4155
03:37:10,540 --> 03:37:10,980
Thank you!

4156
03:37:15,420 --> 03:37:17,480
Thanks for introducing me to Denpugumi!

4157
03:37:18,500 --> 03:37:21,560
Hopefully, my information wasn't like all over the place.

4158
03:37:21,700 --> 03:37:22,900
Hopefully, you guys got a good...

4159
03:37:22,900 --> 03:37:23,480
Good...

4160
03:37:24,380 --> 03:37:26,320
Good idea about them, but...

4161
03:37:27,300 --> 03:37:27,780
Yeah!

4162
03:37:30,340 --> 03:37:33,700
You probably already know that, but in Google Maps, you can also time travel.

4163
03:37:33,800 --> 03:37:34,220
You can!

4164
03:37:38,580 --> 03:37:46,020
And I'll figure out what I'm doing Thursday and Sunday and finish my schedule and have it up maybe tonight or tomorrow.

4165
03:37:46,240 --> 03:37:47,680
For now, I'm gonna go eat.

4166
03:37:48,300 --> 03:37:48,780
And...

4167
03:37:50,360 --> 03:37:50,840
Yes.

4168
03:37:51,100 --> 03:37:52,340
Is there going to be a quiz?

4169
03:37:53,820 --> 03:37:54,380
Absolutely.

4170
03:37:58,500 --> 03:37:59,060
Absolutely.

4171
03:38:01,300 --> 03:38:03,400
So happy I got to see them at AX 2016.

4172
03:38:03,720 --> 03:38:04,120
I...

4173
03:38:04,720 --> 03:38:05,280
I...

4174
03:38:05,280 --> 03:38:06,580
Oh, I regret!

4175
03:38:06,860 --> 03:38:09,560
I regret it every day of my life!

4176
03:38:09,620 --> 03:38:10,260
After life!

4177
03:38:12,100 --> 03:38:14,320
Part of the reason I can't move on.

4178
03:38:14,780 --> 03:38:16,260
It's one of my regrets.

4179
03:38:16,340 --> 03:38:17,060
It's not...

4180
03:38:17,060 --> 03:38:20,100
Not seeing Denpa at AX in 2016.

4181
03:38:21,760 --> 03:38:26,400
You can get a buddy to walk around with a video camera for you or wherever you want, perhaps.

4182
03:38:26,840 --> 03:38:28,240
Yeah, I don't really...

4183
03:38:29,260 --> 03:38:29,780
No.

4184
03:38:30,060 --> 03:38:30,740
I can...

4185
03:38:30,740 --> 03:38:31,940
I will figure something out.

4186
03:38:33,360 --> 03:38:34,620
Yeah, thank you guys!

4187
03:38:35,140 --> 03:38:35,860
Thank you!

4188
03:38:36,740 --> 03:38:37,260
Regret.

4189
03:38:37,360 --> 03:38:37,780
Real.

4190
03:38:38,060 --> 03:38:38,580
Regret.

4191
03:38:38,580 --> 03:38:38,920
Real.

4192
03:38:40,240 --> 03:38:40,980
Thank you!

4193
03:38:41,900 --> 03:38:42,900
Thank you, Boston!

4194
03:38:43,540 --> 03:38:47,220
And I will see you guys on Tuesday for Helldivers 2!

4195
03:38:48,420 --> 03:38:48,940
Okay.

4196
03:38:53,940 --> 03:38:54,880
Bustin' song today?

4197
03:38:56,440 --> 03:38:58,400
I'm going to leave it just Denpa songs today.

4198
03:38:58,520 --> 03:38:58,980
So sorry.

4199
03:39:00,400 --> 03:39:02,960
Sorry, but we're sticking with the Denpa theme.

4200
03:39:04,640 --> 03:39:05,380
But yeah.

4201
03:39:05,540 --> 03:39:06,420
I'm going to go eat.

4202
03:39:06,500 --> 03:39:07,300
You guys rest too.

4203
03:39:07,580 --> 03:39:08,980
Have a great rest.

4204
03:39:09,120 --> 03:39:09,780
Have a great Monday.

4205
03:39:10,420 --> 03:39:13,780
Listen to Mint and Mataro's summer special.

4206
03:39:14,860 --> 03:39:15,380
Yeah.

4207
03:39:16,380 --> 03:39:17,380
Bustin' Denpa cover.

4208
03:39:18,260 --> 03:39:18,780
Okay.

4209
03:39:20,020 --> 03:39:20,540
Bye.

4210
03:39:22,380 --> 03:39:23,460
Bye bye everyone.

4211
03:39:23,740 --> 03:39:24,260
Thank you.

4212
03:39:24,380 --> 03:39:25,040
Bye bye.

4213
03:39:25,080 --> 03:39:25,460
Bye bye.

4214
03:39:25,460 --> 03:39:25,960
Bye bye.

4215
03:39:26,120 --> 03:39:26,640
Bye bye.

4216
03:39:26,640 --> 03:39:26,920
See you.

4217
03:39:26,940 --> 03:39:27,200
See you.

4218
03:39:27,200 --> 03:39:27,500
See you.

4219
03:39:27,620 --> 03:39:28,140
Bye bye.

4220
03:39:28,320 --> 03:39:29,080
Thank you guys.

4221
03:39:29,480 --> 03:39:30,760
Thank you so much.

4222
03:39:31,440 --> 03:39:31,960
Bye.

4223
03:39:32,320 --> 03:39:32,840
Bye.

4224
03:39:35,740 --> 03:39:36,260
Inku.

4225
03:39:38,720 --> 03:39:39,720
Denpa Gumi.

4226
03:39:40,560 --> 03:39:41,080
Inku.

4227
03:39:41,940 --> 03:39:42,680
Bye bye.
