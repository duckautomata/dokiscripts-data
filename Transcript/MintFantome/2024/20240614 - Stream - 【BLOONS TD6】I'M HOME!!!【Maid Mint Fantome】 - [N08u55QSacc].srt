1
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,600
Did you miss me?

2
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,680
Did you miss me?

3
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,140
Did you miss me?

4
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,920
You'll be hearing a lot of that today, I think.

5
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,740
You'll be hearing a lot of that today.

6
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,580
And my congested sniffle.

7
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,060
Don't die, please!

8
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm already dead!

9
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,420
Mint-chan, I'm home!

10
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,940
Still coughing?

11
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,780
What do you mean, still?

12
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,540
What do you mean, still?

13
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,120
I...

14
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,440
I basically just got sick.

15
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,620
Welcome back!

16
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,760
Thank you!

17
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,900
Thank you!

18
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,760
Thank you!

19
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,020
Thank you!

20
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,900
Oh, kind of big.

21
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,720
Thank you!

22
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,760
Thank you!

23
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,320
Thank you!

24
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,360
Thank you!

25
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,380
Thank you!

26
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Thank you!

27
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,840
Thank you!

28
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,580
Thank you!

29
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,060
Thank you!

30
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,320
Hi, everybody!

31
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,160
I'm home.

32
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,780
I'm back.

33
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,460
Welcome.

34
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,540
Welcome back, master and mistress!

35
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,120
Thanks for the pink.

36
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,780
If we need to contact you for something, can we do it via ritual summons?

37
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,560
Or a Luigi board?

38
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,600
Preferably, not a Luigi board.

39
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,820
I mean, you would think that those are kind of great, but...

40
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,480
It's not so good.

41
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,360
Because a whole bunch of lines get crossed, you know?

42
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,600
Andricos, thanks for the tan gift, dude!

43
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Welcome home, thank you!

44
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,660
Why not Luigi board?

45
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,840
Because, I just said, so many other ghosts are just like...

46
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,540
It's my turn to use the Luigi board.

47
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,500
So you won't probably get me.

48
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,220
You'll probably get someone else.

49
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,900
Some freak.

50
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,720
Oh my god.

51
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,840
They say it's me, they'll be like...

52
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,180
Um, hello.

53
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,200
I'm Mint Phantom.

54
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,240
Hello.

55
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,400
You're speaking to Mint.

56
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,520
How can I help you?

57
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,440
And you're like, wow.

58
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,920
The connection makes you sound really weird.

59
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,360
You're like, and the ghost is just like...

60
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,580
Ah, yeah.

61
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,020
I'm just a little shy.

62
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,070
Voice reveal.

63
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,590
I love you!

64
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,630
Thank you so much!

65
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,630
I'm glad I met you.

66
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,550
Thank you so much.

67
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,770
I love you the most in the world.

68
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,230
I love you!

69
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,630
Thank you!

70
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,150
I'm happy.

71
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,170
I finally met you.

72
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,050
I finally met you!

73
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,770
Are you saying we'll get Frogbert even better?

74
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,170
That guy, he's not dead?

75
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,050
What are you talking about?

76
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,350
That guy's not dead?

77
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,410
Anyway, we can talk with some...

78
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,190
What's the word?

79
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,170
Some...

80
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,610
Balloons BGM.

81
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:32,930
Balloons BGM.

82
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,510
So, a couple things happened.

83
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,830
First, I went to Off-Kai.

84
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,350
I went to Off-Kai.

85
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,490
I didn't get to really talk about it.

86
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,450
Well, I talked about it in the podcast with Matara, if you listened to that.

87
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,170
Um...

88
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,330
But, uh...

89
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,390
That was a while ago now, I guess.

90
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:54,890
Right?

91
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,830
It was quite some time ago.

92
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,010
And, um...

93
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,250
Um...

94
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:03,650
Uh...

95
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,250
Off-Kai, my beloved.

96
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:08,930
Not mine.

97
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,510
Well, yes.

98
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,770
I had a great time.

99
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,610
But, uh...

100
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,510
I saw you got swarmed on a robot at Off-Kai.

101
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:17,910
I did!

102
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,730
I did!

103
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,430
I thought I was gonna be able to go around and, like, explore.

104
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:22,970
No!

105
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,790
I just...

106
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,210
I got carried...

107
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,550
To one...

108
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,410
I didn't even get to move myself.

109
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,830
I got picked up...

110
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,590
Like...

111
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,490
Like a baby.

112
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,050
I felt like I got picked up like a child.

113
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,830
And I was carried...

114
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,630
To...

115
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,630
One location.

116
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,930
And people lined up.

117
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,670
Um...

118
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,530
That was funny.

119
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,010
But thank you, Oshilive, for having that happen.

120
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,270
Um...

121
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,970
And, uh...

122
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,170
Um...

123
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,150
Oh my goodness.

124
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,070
What else happened?

125
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,530
Uh...

126
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,190
We did a panel.

127
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,050
It was a lot of fun.

128
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,730
Um...

129
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,710
And...

130
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,310
Matara and I said...

131
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:03,830
I mean...

132
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,290
As we...

133
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,330
And, um...

134
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,530
Gugu gaga, Baby Minto.

135
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,750
Gugu gaga.

136
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,590
And, um...

137
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,290
I mean, if you want probably better...

138
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,090
Better...

139
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,310
Um...

140
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,510
Stories...

141
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,170
You should probably go listen to the podcast episode.

142
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,370
Um...

143
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,910
The next podcast episode, we recorded...

144
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,550
I mean...

145
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,030
Yeah.

146
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:37,030
We recorded and that was good fun, because it's just the two of us being little sickies.

147
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,430
Sick hags.

148
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:53,150
The stream summary I got is Frogbert is no longer on the streaming platform and viewers are upset.

149
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,930
Okay, that guy... give that guy a break, okay?

150
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,010
He'll come back eventually.

151
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,230
Is that the one from the tiny room?

152
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,170
Oh my gosh.

153
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,570
I did talk about it in the last episode.

154
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,510
Kind of what happened with our hotel.

155
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,790
I guess I can be a little bit more specific now, because neither of us are staying there anymore.

156
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:28,050
I believe Matara is still in Japan, but she moved to a different hotel.

157
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,370
But oh my goodness.

158
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,490
The fake apartment hotel.

159
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,830
Oh, I was so... I don't think...

160
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:51,250
I would like Matara to describe the look on my face when we first stepped into that room.

161
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,810
And I was just like, huh?

162
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,070
Like, just pure... disappointment.

163
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:03,450
Well, shock and disappointment and confusion and everything.

164
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,850
Angry ghost.

165
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,410
Oh, I...

166
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,710
Oh my gosh.

167
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,590
You got ripped off?

168
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,370
No, no, no.

169
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,770
I mean... I think... I think what... Okay, so I know what had happened.

170
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,470
I searched.

171
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,650
I searched...

172
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,150
Apartment hotels in Japan.

173
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,910
Because those are totally a thing and I don't do Airbnb.

174
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:34,930
I already said this on the podcast, but I'm still so angry about it that I'll say it again.

175
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,670
And so...

176
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,930
But the hotel we stayed at...

177
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,550
You know what?

178
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,350
I'm just going to name it because I'm never going to stay there again.

179
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,990
Out of fear...

180
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,870
Out of fear...

181
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,790
I'm just going to name it.

182
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:58,010
Because I'm never going to stay there again out of fear of booking the wrong hotel again.

183
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,090
And I'm...

184
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,510
And I do believe that it was Expedia's fault.

185
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,150
Because...

186
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,550
Hold on.

187
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,950
I'm going to Google it right now.

188
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,210
So it was called...

189
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,010
Monday...

190
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,590
Hotel...

191
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:14,810
Ho...

192
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:15,950
Monday...

193
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:18,850
Hotel...

194
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,490
Ap...

195
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,370
Ap...

196
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:20,750
Ap...

197
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,390
Ap...

198
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,030
Apartment.

199
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,490
Now, I need to know where I messed up.

200
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,970
How...

201
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,890
Where did the mistake happen?

202
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,560
I hate Mondays.

203
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,000
Oh, my God.

204
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,460
It actually is so funny because I was just...

205
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,700
I literally was like, I hate Mondays.

206
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,520
Because...

207
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,860
Because of this.

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,560
So...

209
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,320
Okay.

210
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,480
This is also where the confusion happened.

211
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,700
Because I booked the premium version of the hotel.

212
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,400
See, I'm looking at the pictures right now and it says...

213
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,200
Oh, but it says apartment premium.

214
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,240
See, when you think a premium hotel, I was just like...

215
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,120
Oh, maybe that's what they call their larger size rooms, right?

216
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,240
Which, technically, they were kind of larger size than like a normal business hotel.

217
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,100
But, come on.

218
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:29,660
That...

219
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,820
That wording is so confusing.

220
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,820
And so...

221
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:41,320
I booked for the Monday premium hotel and not the Monday apartment premium hotel.

222
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,880
Which was literally right down the street.

223
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,560
Literally right down the...

224
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,780
Oh...

225
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,280
And there's some...

226
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,800
There are a bunch of these, actually.

227
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,780
Wow.

228
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,480
Actually, I didn't realize they were so...

229
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,600
Abundant in Tokyo, but...

230
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,540
That's just bad naming.

231
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,460
I know, right?

232
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,200
That's so frustrating.

233
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,540
And the worst part is...

234
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,440
Well, not the worst part.

235
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,640
I mean, it was still a very nice hotel.

236
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,800
But, if you are ever trying to get an apartment hotel...

237
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,840
Book for the apartment premium hotels.

238
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,800
Not the regular premium hotels.

239
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:22,860
Because...

240
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,800
Also, I only booked...

241
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,920
I booked very...

242
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:26,840
Not booked.

243
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,580
I packed very few clothes.

244
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,780
I was just like...

245
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,720
Oh, I'll just do laundry like every day.

246
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,940
Because we'll have a washer and dryer in our bedroom.

247
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,160
No worries.

248
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,840
So, I had like no clothes.

249
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,760
And I was having to go to the laundry like so much.

250
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,840
And it cost...

251
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,400
It's expensive.

252
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,720
It's 300 yen to wash your clothes.

253
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,720
And then...

254
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,500
100 yen for 30 minutes in the dryer.

255
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,400
It was so...

256
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:53,980
It was just...

257
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,760
I was miserable.

258
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,240
I was so miserable.

259
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,240
And then I was stuck in my little room with Madara.

260
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,740
The whole trip...

261
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,100
The whole trip...

262
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,660
Was...

263
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,540
Fine.

264
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,460
I got to go out for two days.

265
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,580
And...

266
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,780
I bought some clothes.

267
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,560
So, I'm glad about that.

268
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,880
Because I did buy some clothes.

269
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,680
But I didn't get to get...

270
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,740
I didn't get to get all the clothes.

271
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,020
Like I was like...

272
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,440
Oh, I forgot to get these other things that I wanted.

273
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,600
I'll go back out tomorrow.

274
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,020
And then tomorrow is the day...

275
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,560
I basically was sitting in the hotel room.

276
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,180
And I was like...

277
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,660
Oof, my body feels heavy.

278
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,780
I wonder if this is delayed jet lag.

279
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,440
And then I like took a nap.

280
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,460
And then while I was napping...

281
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,260
I woke up...

282
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,240
Like at 9 p.m.

283
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,740
And I was like...

284
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,060
Uh-oh.

285
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,760
I have chills.

286
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,240
And I was like...

287
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,640
Uh-oh.

288
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,880
I don't think this is just my body being heavy anymore.

289
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,020
Ugh.

290
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,400
Did you get to visit any maid cafes or idol shows?

291
00:15:59,480 --> 00:15:59,720
Yes!

292
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,540
Luckily.

293
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,680
The day after we arrived...

294
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,720
There was an idol show that I...

295
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,820
That we got to go to.

296
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,560
And...

297
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,260
So we went there.

298
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,700
That was good.

299
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,500
And...

300
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,100
Then the day after...

301
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,240
The day after...

302
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,640
We were actually supposed to go to...

303
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,100
Um...

304
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,820
A theme park.

305
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,180
We were going to go to Fuji-Q.

306
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,540
Uh...

307
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,240
With a couple people.

308
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,820
But because Matara was like...

309
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,040
I don't know, man.

310
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,760
I'm starting to not feel so good.

311
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,960
And I saw a lot of people saying that they got COVID at Ofukai.

312
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,000
But none of the people that we interacted with...

313
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Got COVID.

314
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,280
So we were like...

315
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,980
Hmm...

316
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,280
But she was like...

317
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,640
I'm really not feeling well.

318
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,020
So I think I'm gonna...

319
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,400
I think I'm gonna test because...

320
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,620
I don't want to go out with you.

321
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:54,880
I don't want to go out with people.

322
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,840
And get them sick.

323
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,320
You know?

324
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,000
Like...

325
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,840
She was like...

326
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,020
Really worried about...

327
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,460
Um...

328
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,180
You know?

329
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,560
Because it was a few people...

330
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,200
A few other VTubers that we didn't know very well either.

331
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:05,860
And we were like...

332
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,240
She was like...

333
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,060
I don't know how...

334
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,820
You know?

335
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,600
How their bodies are.

336
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,040
I'm a roach.

337
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,660
I can survive.

338
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,140
But she was like...

339
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,500
I'm...

340
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,020
You know?

341
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,980
Concerned about the other people.

342
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,500
And so...

343
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,140
Um...

344
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,920
Fuji-Q...

345
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,600
He was like...

346
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
I can't go.

347
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,500
We couldn't go.

348
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,940
Because she tested.

349
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,580
And then...

350
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,000
It was...

351
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,100
Yeah.

352
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,140
She got COVID.

353
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,220
And then I was like...

354
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,940
Well, if you're sick...

355
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,560
I'm probably sick.

356
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,100
And then I tested.

357
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,480
Because...

358
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,620
One of the things that we were wanting to do...

359
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:39,840
Or...

360
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,940
Actually, the reason I went to Japan...

361
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,700
On this trip...

362
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,980
I was originally not going to go on this trip.

363
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,140
But the reason I went...

364
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,880
On this trip...

365
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,740
Was for one reason.

366
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,360
And...

367
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,000
We didn't get to do it.

368
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,360
And...

369
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,040
We didn't get to do it.

370
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,580
And...

371
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,460
We didn't get to do it.

372
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,580
Because...

373
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,680
And...

374
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,900
It was...

375
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,460
The Bishoujo staff was helping us...

376
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,840
Set it up.

377
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:03,880
And...

378
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,740
Basically, they were like...

379
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,740
Hey, you guys said you have COVID.

380
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,400
So...

381
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,640
We're going to have to cancel.

382
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,320
And I was like...

383
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

384
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,640
I feel fine.

385
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,220
I feel fine.

386
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,780
Let me test.

387
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,260
Let me test.

388
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,580
If I can still...

389
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,540
If I'm fine...

390
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,940
Can I still do it?

391
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,240
And they were like...

392
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,800
And then I tested.

393
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,900
And I was negative.

394
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,480
And I was like...

395
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,920
I'm fine.

396
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:24,640
Because if I did the test right...

397
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:24,960
I...

398
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,140
I just posted.

399
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,180
Because I assumed...

400
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,940
And you know what...

401
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,520
Assuming makes the ass out of you or me.

402
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,360
So...

403
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:30,900
I was like...

404
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,280
Oh, no.

405
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,060
Please, let me go.

406
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,040
And I ended up getting sick afterall.

407
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,180
I could still fight.

408
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,460
That was literally me.

409
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,820
That was literally me.

410
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,420
I was like...

411
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,080
No, no, no.

412
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,600
Wait, wait.

413
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,400
I was like...

414
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,900
I made a mistake.

415
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,780
Because in Japan...

416
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,380
They're still very serious about that kind of stuff.

417
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:52,880
So...

418
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,680
So, especially if you say, hi, I have COVID, they're just like, oh, cancel everything.

419
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,580
We will, we will.

420
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,760
Quarantine, quarantine.

421
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,120
So, we were like, okay, well, mint's fine.

422
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,880
Send her in.

423
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,660
And then the next day, I got sick.

424
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,600
What was the next?

425
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,320
Maybe the next day, day after.

426
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,000
I think it was the day after.

427
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,220
And I was like, oh, shoot.

428
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,060
So, we stayed in our hotel room the whole time.

429
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,200
Basically.

430
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,020
And, um, yeah.

431
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,260
I did go out.

432
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,160
The day before, I started feeling bad.

433
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,160
I did go to Akiba.

434
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,260
And Akiba, it was so weird.

435
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,820
It was really weird.

436
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:46,820
Like, the place was packed, first of all, because there was an Atlas festival that was going on.

437
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,780
And, uh, there was just so many people for that.

438
00:19:52,880 --> 00:20:00,500
And, already, Akiba is pretty crowded because of, um, because of, uh, tourists.

439
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,340
So, um, it was crazy, crazy, crazy.

440
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,860
Let me see if I have...

441
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:14,760
I took, I posted, I think, the, um, I didn't take very many pictures because I didn't know how many pictures I could take.

442
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,340
Um, I think I, there was one...

443
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,500
Did I take a video?

444
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,520
I could hear, like, a concert going on inside.

445
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,740
No, I didn't take a video.

446
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
I only took, I only took the photos.

447
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,540
Um, but, uh, so that was crazy.

448
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:42,320
And then I was like, I wanted to go to, um, just a maid cafe to, like, chill.

449
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,720
Um, I was like, I'll go to a better, you know, not a better.

450
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,140
I was like, I'll go to, like, a, you know, a, a, a, uh, you know.

451
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,300
Stereotypical maid cafe in the upcoming days.

452
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,180
Today, I just wanna, I just wanna, like, chill.

453
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,420
I wanna, like, so I was like, I'll go to Cure Maid Cafe.

454
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,740
I'll go to Cure Maid Cafe.

455
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,780
There's a, a, a, like, an hour and a half, two hour wait.

456
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,300
And I was like, excuse me?

457
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,900
I have never, never, ever, ever had to get a reservation.

458
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,340
I was like, what?

459
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,560
That's crazy.

460
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,820
And so I put in a reservation.

461
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,180
And then I, um, I went downstairs.

462
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,940
And there was a Lucky Star Haruhi 20th Anniversary pop-up store.

463
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,660
So I was like, hanging out in there.

464
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,460
And I was like, yippee, this is cool.

465
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,280
And, um, you don't wanna chill in line for the maid cafe?

466
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
There wasn't a line.

467
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,440
It was, you put in a little, you, you apply for a reservation.

468
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,680
And then they call you back.

469
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,260
They were like, feel free to go anywhere and walk around.

470
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,200
So I did that.

471
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,520
My abode.

472
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,020
So.

473
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,840
I know, right?

474
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,360
I was like 20th.

475
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,100
And I was like, I think there's a misprint or something.

476
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,160
I meant to go back.

477
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,920
I was poor, innocent me thinking back.

478
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,900
I was like, I'm not going to buy much of anything because I'll just come back and get it another day.

479
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,960
So I didn't end up buying, there was like a cute little acrylic calendar that I was going to get.

480
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,620
So I didn't, I ended up not getting anything.

481
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,160
I'm so sad.

482
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,320
I didn't want to carry stuff around.

483
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:41,600
Um, little did she know, but, uh, and then I was like, well, I was like in the store for a while and I was like, man, it's still a lot of time before I have to go back to the maid cafe.

484
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,880
So I was walking around some more and I was like, you know what, um, let's see, you know, cure maid cafe had a really long wait.

485
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,300
Let's go check out, um, jam jam.

486
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,780
Jam is another really chill maid cafe.

487
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,200
And so I went there and I saw that they had a Kagura Nana, um, collab.

488
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,800
And I was like, oh my gosh, wait, this is so awesome.

489
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,560
And so I was like, I'll go here instead.

490
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,200
And so I canceled my reservation for cure.

491
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,960
And they were like, even though they were like, it's almost your time.

492
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,180
And I was like, no, I want to go to this one instead.

493
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,660
Um, and, uh, Nana Mama is so cute.

494
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,140
I know, I know everything was so cute, but I go in there.

495
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,080
And there's, they also, they're like, uh, you have to come back in an hour and a half.

496
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,640
Is that okay?

497
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,220
And I was like, okay.

498
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,440
I think, uh, I think the collab at the cure maid cafe was like date a live.

499
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,560
So I was like, I'd rather do Nana Mama.

500
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,020
Um, so even though I canceled, I was going to do Nana Mama anyway.

501
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,080
So I was like, okay.

502
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,280
I'll just wait.

503
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:57,440
Another hour and a half, I'll just do another hour and a half.

504
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,340
Wait, no worries, even though I had been waiting so much before.

505
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,560
And so I was like, you know what?

506
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:04,960
It's fine.

507
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:13,100
I'll go to, um, I'll go to culture zone, which is a big, like building of just a bunch of, a bunch of stuff.

508
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,460
There's like a bunch of floors.

509
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,920
The first floor was at, oh my gosh, it was absolutely insanity.

510
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,920
There was like.

511
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:26,520
There was just, there was like children, like on the floor, like playing with figures and stuff.

512
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,560
And I was like, what is going on?

513
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,820
Is this a Toys R Us?

514
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:37,380
Like, I went upstairs because there's an idol store in culture zone that I go to called trio.

515
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,720
And I go there, I go to the trio and it's gone.

516
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:47,020
And I was like, but, um, it actually, they moved floors.

517
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,620
I believe they, uh, I didn't actually get to go.

518
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:55,840
Because, um, I, uh, got distracted by some other stuff and I went into one store.

519
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,760
Okay.

520
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:07,600
This is why I said like, when we first arrived in Japan, Matara was just like, man, that whole trip, it felt, it felt like we're in the, we're in the twilight zone.

521
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,220
Like, and I was like, that's, I think that's the whole theme of this trip.

522
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,900
It just felt like the twilight zone.

523
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,600
Everything just felt a little off the entire time.

524
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,700
And I was like, what is going on?

525
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,160
What a curse trip.

526
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,740
It really was my flight back was so cursed.

527
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:38,680
Like the plane was having, luckily it was not a Boeing, but it was having, it was having tech issues and like the lights kept flashing on and on.

528
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:44,000
Like, you know how, like in the middle of a international flight, they'll turn the lights off so that you can sleep.

529
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,960
The lights would just randomly turn off in the middle of everybody.

530
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,580
So.

531
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,300
And then the music would start blaring because they were trying to fix the sounds.

532
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,580
We didn't even get to watch the safety video because they were having so many technical issues.

533
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:12,040
And like, sometimes the music would, they had like a radio that they would play and it would just start blaring music in the middle of the flight.

534
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,260
It was so cursed.

535
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,580
And, um, but yeah, I was in culture zone and I was in a random zone.

536
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:34,460
I was in a random store looking around because sometimes I like to just, um, there's like these stores that have cubes of figures and I like to see if I can find any metal gear stuff in there, but I was in a random store and some guy came up to me and he was like in English.

537
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,640
He asked me, are you looking for anything in particular?

538
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,780
I said, no, just looking, which that has never happened to me before.

539
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,040
I was like, huh?

540
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,740
Like I thought he was up, but I had never been in that store before.

541
00:26:49,240 --> 00:27:06,560
Haunted plane, my bad, my bad, sorry, um, but, uh, you've got tourists, like that has never happened to people or someone came up and was just like, hey, are you looking for something?

542
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,520
It was very strange.

543
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,560
I was like, oh, no, I'm, I'm fine.

544
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,020
I'm just looking.

545
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,500
Thank you.

546
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,620
And I left because I was like, don't talk to me.

547
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,720
Even if you're, even if you're a store attendant, please don't talk to me.

548
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:31,320
And I went to the next next floor and, um, there was a Toho collab, which, um, of an artist, um, who's specified in Remilia-sama.

549
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,180
So I was just like, Ooh, yippee.

550
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:41,720
So I got some stuff there, but the guy also, there was a guy there who also started talking to me, but this time in Japanese, it was just like, Toho ga suki desu ka?

551
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,920
And I was just like, yeah, I love Toho.

552
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,260
And then, and then he started talking to me and asking me questions.

553
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,840
But this guy worked here, but I was like, Arigato, arigato.

554
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,400
Chuu.

555
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,260
Chuu.

556
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,000
Thank you.

557
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,200
Did our COVID cycle sync up?

558
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,840
Hazakashii.

559
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,020
Oh my gosh, hazakashii.

560
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,880
But, um, but I was like, huh?

561
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,100
Huh?

562
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,820
Why are you talking to me?

563
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,800
Why are you asking me questions?

564
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,240
But then the guy, the guy from the, from the previous store comes to me.

565
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:24,780
He walks into this store and he starts asking me questions again in English.

566
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,100
And I'm like, wait, you weren't a store attendant in the last one.

567
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,840
He was just some random guy asking if I was looking for something.

568
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,140
He wasn't even an employee.

569
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,840
I don't really even remember what he was asking me.

570
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,860
I was so shocked.

571
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,360
I was like, why are you here?

572
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,210
He works at both locations.

573
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,950
I was so confused.

574
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:05,390
I was like, I literally thought he was an employee of the previous store.

575
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,950
He's the building manager.

576
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:20,370
I think he was asking me like, um, uh, uh, if I like was studying or, you know, um, I don't know.

577
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,810
I don't know, just those kinds of like questions you ask foreigners.

578
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,510
I was reverse haunted by this guy.

579
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,850
I was like, so funny.

580
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,410
But it was so bizarre.

581
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,230
I've never been asked...

582
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:40,190
I've never been talked to in Akiba like that.

583
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,310
So I was like...

584
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,320
Maybe because there was such an influx of foreigners that day.

585
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,540
I don't know.

586
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,280
But...

587
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,220
I got some of the... I got some Touhou stuff.

588
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,460
So that was fun.

589
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,380
And then by the time...

590
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,480
By the time everything had finished, it had already been an hour and a half.

591
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:06,140
So I got the hell out of there before that guy could come back to the next...

592
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,060
He probably...

593
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,560
I was like, I wonder if he went to the next floor and was waiting for me there.

594
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,580
So I ran.

595
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,000
I was like, well this guy...

596
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,720
Surely doesn't have a...

597
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,680
A reservation for jam Akihabara.

598
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,680
So I ran away.

599
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,200
Oh, he just really wanted to practice his English.

600
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,000
See, usually like that's...

601
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,340
I don't find that ever to be the case with people.

602
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,740
Very rarely do people want to practice their English.

603
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,420
Oh my goodness.

604
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,220
But yeah.

605
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,140
So that was a very strange time.

606
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,400
I was...

607
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,960
I was like, what?

608
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,240
Akihabara is just strange today.

609
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,080
The whole...

610
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,460
I'm in the Twilight Zone!

611
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,540
I didn't...

612
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,460
It was just such a weird trip.

613
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,930
And then...

614
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,150
Like I said, I got sick.

615
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,910
So Mitara and I, we just...

616
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,350
Laid in bed...

617
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:10,430
For...

618
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,030
Four days and then I went home.

619
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,670
So...

620
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,110
Yeah.

621
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,870
I'm very sad that...

622
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:23,150
I do feel like it was a waste of a trip.

623
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,810
I feel...

624
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,410
I feel...

625
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,530
Hold on, let me take a sippy.

626
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,090
I feel very like I...

627
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,970
Wasted a lot of money and time and everything going.

628
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:33,710
Which...

629
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:36,110
I mean, obviously we couldn't have known, but...

630
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,300
It just really...

631
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,600
Would you have stayed longer if you didn't get sick?

632
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,100
No, no.

633
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,860
I left...

634
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,360
I actually left a little bit early.

635
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,280
And a dot very early.

636
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,700
Like a...

637
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,560
Just a day early.

638
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,560
Because I was like...

639
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,540
There's no point in me staying here.

640
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,140
So I just...

641
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,420
Yeah...

642
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,880
It was...

643
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,620
It's...

644
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,620
I just...

645
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,040
I think I'm most disappointed...

646
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,400
Or not...

647
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,240
Well, not disappointed.

648
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,160
I'm most frustrated because...

649
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,640
In July I've...

650
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,720
Kind of really overbooked myself.

651
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,580
And so now I'm just like...

652
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,380
Having to...

653
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,200
Plan...

654
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,360
See, I was...

655
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,800
Planning on going to...

656
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,500
Like...

657
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,060
Maybe...

658
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,620
Like...

659
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,620
Go around Anime Expo a little bit.

660
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,840
Since I'm going for the...

661
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,340
Um...

662
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,620
For the virtual concert.

663
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,360
But...

664
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,280
I've decided that I'm just gonna go to the concert and then head back immediately.

665
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:33,940
Because...

666
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,840
Uh...

667
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,500
I've already...

668
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,320
Missed so much time streaming.

669
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,460
And...

670
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,680
Um...

671
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,500
And I'm also going to have to probably go back to Japan...

672
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,400
In July sometime.

673
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,080
So Matara and I are trying to figure that out too.

674
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,780
And it's like...

675
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,320
Uh...

676
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,520
It's uh...

677
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,780
It's uh...

678
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,880
Yeah...

679
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,580
I'm just really frustrated about it.

680
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,020
Hmm...

681
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,280
Yeah, yeah.

682
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,140
But oh well.

683
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,160
Hmm...

684
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,820
Oh well.

685
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,940
Don't worry about us if that's the case.

686
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,360
But I mean I do...

687
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,860
Not...

688
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,600
I'm...

689
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:19,760
I'm...

690
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:19,980
I mean...

691
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,440
Wait...

692
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,340
Hold on.

693
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,900
I'm trying to think...

694
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,680
I worry...

695
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,260
About...

696
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,240
Like...

697
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,360
I mean...

698
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,560
It's just like that whole...

699
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,960
If I'm not making content, I'm not doing anything with my channel.

700
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,700
Man, man, man.

701
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,020
Um...

702
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,120
There was stuff that I did get to take care of while in Japan.

703
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,540
And hopefully some cool things that...

704
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,520
Happen.

705
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,800
Um...

706
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,120
Of things that I...

707
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,740
Was doing in Japan.

708
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,020
But I didn't have to be in Japan for those things.

709
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,540
Is the...

710
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,320
Is...

711
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
Is the thing.

712
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:54,640
Cause...

713
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,740
Matara was just like...

714
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,080
Look at all the stuff you got done!

715
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:57,720
And I was like...

716
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,580
I would've gotten that done in my maid cafe too!

717
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,300
What?

718
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:03,820
Ugh...

719
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,080
That's rough broski.

720
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,680
Why do you hate us?

721
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:06,960
No!

722
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,500
Um...

723
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,240
I was...

724
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
Rather saying...

725
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,440
It's...

726
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,780
It's...

727
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,100
Like...

728
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,820
I'm not like...

729
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,240
Oh...

730
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,040
I'm not worried...

731
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,660
About...

732
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,300
Like...

733
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,420
Why would you guys forget about me?

734
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,360
But I kinda worry...

735
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,080
About that.

736
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:27,980
Kinda.

737
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,960
Kinda worry about that.

738
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,840
According to YouTube...

739
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,600
You are frustrated at Anime Expo.

740
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,360
So frustrated.

741
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,420
But yeah.

742
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,480
Um...

743
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,400
Hmm...

744
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,440
Were you able to receive gifts from...

745
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,640
Mintos?

746
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,260
From who?

747
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,840
Mintos?

748
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,840
Me?

749
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,360
Are Oshis a little tsundere?

750
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,860
What do you mean by that?

751
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,800
What do you mean by that?

752
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,080
You'd have to do a lot better than that...

753
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,640
To get rid of the worst of them.

754
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,340
Hmm...

755
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,040
Yeah...

756
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,600
You're stuck...

757
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,740
You're stuck...

758
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,080
You're stuck...

759
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,120
You're stuck...

760
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,300
You're stuck...

761
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,580
Good.

762
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,780
Where Mintos...

763
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,760
I can count nine of them right now.

764
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:42,760
Anyway...

765
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,460
Yeah...

766
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,380
So I really...

767
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,580
Wish I could say more about my trip...

768
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:47,980
But I...

769
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,180
Don't quite have so much about my trip.

770
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,060
You know.

771
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,260
Just kinda...

772
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,660
Well,

773
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,020
isn't that quite mysterious?

774
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,640
Let's see guys, let's see...

775
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,120
Let's see where do we want to go today?

776
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,340
I have to unlock some of these harder ones.

777
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,020
Rake!

778
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:22,960
Oh!

779
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,320
Oh, I can unlock it!

780
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,400
Wait, click to unlock.

781
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,460
Oh!

782
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,490
Be the beginner map.

783
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,330
Oh.

784
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:35,950
Haunted!

785
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,550
Looking forward to the concert during AX.

786
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,950
I tried to prepare the VIP tickets but they sold out so fast.

787
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,070
You girls are so popular, it's crazy.

788
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,530
Good luck!

789
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:46,570
Thank you!

790
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,010
Oh, thank you for reminding me.

791
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,330
Hold on, I have to respond to something.

792
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:51,670
Looks great!

793
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,710
So cute.

794
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,850
They were showing me the... some of the stuff for the T-shirts.

795
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,950
The Among Us 2 got ejected for being sus.

796
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,090
Someone went welcome to membership but then they disappeared.

797
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,990
Was it you, Kenny?

798
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,930
I started my Metal Gear experience with Phantom Pain.

799
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,750
Are you done dying from an aneurysm yet?

800
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,930
Because I lied, I started with the original on the NES.

801
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,570
I'm old as hell.

802
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,050
Younger than Mata, though.

803
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,250
She's so old.

804
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,310
It was Ken... no?

805
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,370
Huh, Kenny, huh?

806
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,790
Huh, Kenny, huh?

807
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,690
All you ever got and nothing big happened in my life.

808
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:43,250
A dog I used to watch named Duck Duck was given up by his mother.

809
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,710
He and I now live together full time and watch you together...

810
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,750
Duck Duck!

811
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,490
That was a dog's name, Duck Duck.

812
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,130
So, Sophia, thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

813
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,130
Thank you!

814
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,850
I've got an interview for MGS CON 2 staff in like 7 minutes.

815
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,410
Let's go, Road!

816
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,130
You're gonna staff?

817
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,090
Speaking of Metal Gear...

818
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,110
Oh my god!

819
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,910
I ordered the...

820
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,450
Dell, thank you for the 20 gifted!

821
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:21,870
Thank you!

822
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,350
Freaky ghost, Sophia.

823
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,570
Metal Gear... let's do Haunted, even though it's a harder map.

824
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,810
We'll do it on Medium.

825
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,130
Oh, wait, hold on, you guys.

826
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,570
Hold on before we talk about Metal Gear.

827
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,710
Look, I have...

828
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,310
You can't see... there we go.

829
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,430
I have so much money, I can buy a hero.

830
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,850
I was trying the new hero.

831
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:43,570
Where is she?

832
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:43,790
Oh.

833
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,010
Rosalia, she's so cute!

834
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:47,210
So cute!

835
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,270
Doing subsistence for MGS 3?

836
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,110
I don't know yet.

837
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,650
I haven't decided.

838
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,990
We're gonna start Metal Gear next week, so...

839
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,770
Ironfall!

840
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:01,970
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

841
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,510
Thank you!

842
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,330
Did I say thank you Dell already?

843
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:04,950
Did I?

844
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,110
Thank you!

845
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:11,570
July!

846
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,630
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

847
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,830
Be my child!

848
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,050
Thank you for the 5 gifted!

849
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,030
Commencing Virtuous Mention.

850
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,410
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted!

851
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,790
Oh my god, fight, sis!

852
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,630
Thank you for the 5 gifted!

853
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,630
Thank you, guys!

854
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,270
Oh my gosh, thank you for the 5 gifted!

855
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:30,850
Thank you, guys!

856
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,650
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

857
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,730
Oh my gosh.

858
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,230
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

859
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,750
Welcome back, Minto.

860
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,370
Can I get a happy birthday?

861
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,670
As cursed as you want to sing it.

862
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,290
It was on June the 2nd.

863
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,610
Happy birthday, Warsaw!

864
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,390
Happy birthday to you!

865
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,050
Happy birthday!

866
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,070
Happy birthday!

867
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,290
Happy birthday to you!

868
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,360
I had to do it fast, cause it's quite past your birthday.

869
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,120
Sorry.

870
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,280
Oh my gosh!

871
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,640
Why are there so many gifted?

872
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,060
Take up the...

873
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,100
Thank you for the 10!

875
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,820
Minto, fresh Kyle!

876
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,640
Thank you for the 50!

877
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,960
Thank you, guys!

878
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,720
Thank you!

879
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,860
Thank you, thank you!

880
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,340

00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,340
Oh my gosh.

888
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,980
Gavel, thanks for the 5!

889
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,660
I can't keep up!

890
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,340
Wait, it's like...

891
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,200
Delayed, though!

892
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,740
It's like, delayed!

893
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,180
Stop!

894
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,380
So many gifted!

895
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,200
You'll get a sub!

896
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,520
You'll get a sub!

897
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,110
It's too fast!

898
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,670
Stop!

899
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,890
I can't keep up!

900
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,390

00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,090
I think I'm repeating people!

920
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,970
Nils, thank you for the 50!

921
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,050
Oh my gosh, you guys, please...

922
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,070
Kenny, thanks for the gifted!

923
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,350
Good playlist, thanks for the 10!

924
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,270
You guys are trying to talk!

925
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,910
Derpyster, thanks for the 5!

926
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,870
Joseph, welcome back!

927
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,870
You guys are trying to talk!

928
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:00,850
Should we buy a new hero, is what I'm trying to...

929
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,070
Ah, Stakiro!

930
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,710
Thanks for the hot koi soba!

931
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,450
Micmac, thanks for the 5!

932
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,870
Chidonchan, thanks for the 5!

933
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,410
InvisibleMoose, thanks for the 10!

934
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,050
Prince of Denmark, thanks for the 20!

935
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:20,970
Bloodlust, thanks for the 10!

936
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,030
Speak, then!

937
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,010
Stofan, thanks for the 10!

938
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,290
Should we get a new...

939
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,090
Should we get a new...

940
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,590
1?

941
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,750
Thank you

942
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,220
for the 50!

943
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,160
Lost at the store, thanks for the 10!

944
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,320
Kenny, thank you for the 1!

945
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,940
I saw it, I saw it before it disappeared!

946
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,060
Cody, thank you for the 10!

947
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,180
Which monkey is the Nacho Libre monkey?

948
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,300
I don't know...

949
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,920
I don't think he's in this movie.

950
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,440
Buy the coolest one?

951
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,960
No, because he thinks we're the 5!

952
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,660
Damn, over.

953
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,960
Which is the coolest one?

954
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,480
We have 5,000 monkey bucks.

955
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,860
We could literally...

956
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:14,700
Oh, I was going to say we could literally buy any of them, but we can't buy Geraldo or...

957
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,460
Covid virus.

958
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,260
Setsuna, thanks for the 10!

959
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,680
Citizen Phoenix, thanks for the 10!

960
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:30,740
Saora?

961
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,840
She seems pretty cool.

962
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,940
Kenpop camel.

963
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,060
Is she good?

964
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,680
I can't believe skins are so expensive too.

965
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:46,440
Oh.

966
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,120
Quincy.

967
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,500
Those scrolls lead to a quest for the heroes.

968
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,660
Yeah, but you don't get the heroes.

969
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,220
You just get rewards for them.

970
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,240
I'm drunk!

971
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,420
Thanks for the 10!

972
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,320
Saora is the best.

973
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,620
Saora can solo chumps.

974
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,680
Damn, really?

975
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,740
Fat, I mean...

976
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,820
Pat Fusty.

977
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,740
Checkraitor, thanks for the 20!

978
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,600
Classroom.

979
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,420
Just passed my interview to become a full-time cardiologist at a hospital.

980
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,660
Let's go, Ashwin!

981
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:25,940
Wow.

982
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,780
You're smart.

983
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,060
You're a doctor.

984
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,800
You're a real doctor.

985
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,340
You're a real doctor.

986
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,140
So, should we get Saora?

987
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,420
She pretty good?

988
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,200
Yeah.

989
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,440
Kind of sad.

990
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,820
Maybe I should save up for the haunted man.

991
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,940
Look, it kind of looks like you a little bit.

992
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,740
Kind of looks like a wisp.

993
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,000
I'm gonna grab that tooth.

994
00:44:59,400 --> 00:44:59,940
Let's go!

995
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:07,370
Corvus.

996
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:12,030
Going on a trip to New York in late August.

997
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,370
Can you recommend some places to see?

998
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,450
I'd love to see Federal Hall for MGS2.

999
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:20,970
I'd love to see Federal Hall for MGS2.

1000
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,810
I don't know many places in New York though.

1001
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,030
Something I think of Ryan.

1002
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:27,970
Thanks man.

1003
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,390
You're pretty cool yourself.

1004
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:33,030
What is something to do in New York?

1005
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,700
Federal Hall.

1006
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,080
I wanna go stand where Solidus died.

1007
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,540
Catch me on the back of the statue.

1008
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:48,820
Catch me on the back of the statue.

1009
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,640
There's like peace sign.

1010
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,520
Oh my gosh, I wanna go see where the president died.

1011
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,000
I don't plan on going to Anime MYC though.

1012
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,060
I thought maybe to go for the Hololive concert but...

1013
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,500
I think I'm too booked up in July and in August.

1014
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,420
So it's kind of hard.

1015
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,500
So it's kind of hard.

1016
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:18,940
And now we're overlapping.

1017
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,120
Oopsie.

1018
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,340
Glad to have you back, Mint.

1019
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,320
I'm so happy I got to say hi to you at Ofukai.

1020
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:26,640
Yeah!

1021
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,120
Catch Mint jumping on the random cargo ships off the Brooklyn Bridge.

1022
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:34,540
Maya!

1023
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,480
So happy to see you back, Mitochan!

1024
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:36,960
Maya!

1025
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:41,200
I'm glad we could see each other at Ofukai!

1026
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,940
I hope you're feeling okay.

1027
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,660
But I didn't get sick at Ofukai.

1028
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,480
But I didn't get sick at Ofukai.

1029
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:48,640
I'm sorry, Tara.

1030
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,080
It's not my fault.

1031
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,260
It's not me!

1032
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,140
TV table tray.

1033
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,160
Thanks for the 10.

1034
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,160
You're welcome.

1035
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,900
Thank you so much.

1036
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,320
I blame the roach.

1037
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:05,980
As you should.

1038
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,760
Should I get Saada because she's cool?

1039
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,460
Actually, I really want this skin.

1040
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,940
Maybe I'll get her and then save up for this.

1041
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,900
Look how cool she looks.

1042
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,460
Actually, I've been wanting this skin for a while.

1043
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,300
I've been wanting this skin for a long time.

1044
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,400
The Raiden skin kills me every time.

1045
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,570
Jiangshi's skin is so good.

1046
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,550
It really is.

1047
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,410
It's really cute.

1048
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,030
Saada is really good.

1049
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:38,570
All in favor of buying Saada, say aye.

1050
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,570
Thanks for the super chat, you guys!

1051
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,930
Xbox Showcase showed MGS Delta outside my own freakout.

1052
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,450
I was wondering...

1053
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:48,770
Oh boy, I wonder how Mint is going to react.

1054
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,750
I got the Collector's Edition and Backpack Ordered.

1055
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,730
I got the...

1056
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,630
I didn't get the...

1057
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,810
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

1058
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,170
Okay, that's a buy.

1059
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,650
I didn't get the...

1060
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:04,310
I got the...

1061
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,090
My blade's legendary.

1062
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,690
My blade's legendary.

1063
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,370
I didn't get the...

1064
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:14,370
I got the other tactical backpack before they announced the camo one.

1065
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:17,870
But I like mine more than the tactical one.

1066
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:18,410
I like mine more than the tactical one.

1067
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:19,530
Or the camo one, I mean.

1068
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,150
My friend Leah's birthday is this weekend.

1069
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,690
I want to surprise her with a happy birthday from you.

1070
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,550
Would you sing her a ghostie happy birthday?

1071
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,250
Thank you!

1072
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,190
Bia, your friend Leah.

1073
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:33,490
Leah!

1074
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,030
Leah!

1075
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:35,910
Happy birthday!

1076
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,110
I've been asked to sing a happy...

1077
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:39,450
I've been asked to sing a happy...

1078
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:39,790
A ghostie.

1079
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,390
Happy birthday to you.

1080
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,930
Happy birthday to you.

1081
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,810
Happy birthday to you.

1082
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,790
Happy birthday, dear Leah.

1083
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:02,630
Happy birthday to you.

1084
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:07,230
Happy birthday, dear Leah.

1085
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:07,530
Happy birthday!

1086
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:07,950
Happy birthday!

1087
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,430
Okay, let's try.

1088
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,670
Let's go to haunted.

1089
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:15,710
Medium is premium.

1090
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:23,830
What does this mean?

1091
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,710
Oh, you can't see.

1092
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,510
I can't see it because I'm a big head.

1093
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:25,930
Hold on.

1094
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,430
I'm going to scoot down a little bit.

1095
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:32,470
What does... what does this mean?

1096
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:34,910
I don't know.

1097
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:35,870
I've never seen it before.

1098
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:44,860
Are you guys still gifting?

1099
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,500
Thank you so much!

1100
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,400
Oh my gosh.

1101
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,760
Joseph, Duffy, I don't even know how many you gifted.

1102
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,420
I'm just...

1103
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,360
Say your name!

1104
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,480
You have an upgrade.

1105
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,220
Oh...

1106
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,840
You can unlock their final form.

1107
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,780
Oh, is that what that means?

1108
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,340
Wait, like this?

1109
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,960
Oh, no I can't.

1110
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,540
No I can't.

1111
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,400
Morning, dude.

1112
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,160
Thanks for the 10.

1113
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,620
Hi, Mint.

1114
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,040
Hello.

1115
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,380
Hello, Mr. Bush.

1116
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,320
It's for a challenge.

1117
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,180
Okay, okay.

1118
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,120
Hmm...

1119
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:27,380
Hmm...

1120
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:28,920
Let's try her out.

1121
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,220
I'm just going to put her...

1122
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,340
Where should I put her?

1123
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:33,640
Here.

1124
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,260
Let's make some ribbons!

1125
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:36,940
Some what?

1126
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:38,540
Jamie!

1127
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,940
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

1128
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:40,740
Thank you.

1129
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,180
Oh!

1130
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,060
Oh shoot!

1131
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:44,960
They come from this way too!

1132
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:45,780
Uh oh.

1133
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,360
Uh oh.

1134
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,620
She was almost on beat for a second.

1135
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,100
Mr. Minto.

1136
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,760
Mr. Minto!

1137
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,860
Can you please say LOL, weep, and get rekt?

1138
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,340
LOL, weep, and get rekt?

1139
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,080
LOL,

1140
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:14,290
weep, and get rekt?

1141
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:17,610
I discovered you through Hanya.

1142
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:20,330
You became one of my favorite streamers to watch.

1143
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,070
Keep up the dope work, dude.

1144
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:23,450
Thanks, DJ!

1145
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,730
Thanks, DJ!

1146
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:54,750
The other day, sometimes I'm like, yeah, I'm indie, but I can't, I want to like, I should behave better sometimes, you know, I, uh, I almost tweeted, I almost just tweeted Sarah's Fauna, just cause I really like her.

1147
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:08,810
But I'm glad I didn't, because the other day she followed me back, and I was just sitting there going, ooooh, I was like, ooooh, I was so happy, but real though, right?

1148
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:12,270
She's just so cute.

1149
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,410
I just, I just kind of like her a normal amount.

1150
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:20,510
Look at her go.

1151
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:25,450
I'm saving up cause I want to buy this boat.

1152
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:28,130
Real tweeted.

1153
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,190
Uh oh, uh oh.

1154
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,350
Everyone's going to say bad placement.

1155
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,800
Normal amount.

1156
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:55,660
Uh oh.

1157
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,080
It's not showing me gifted.

1158
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,600
Are these old ones, or?

1159
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,200
It's not showing me.

1160
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,660
It's just showing me people who are gifted.

1161
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,460
Oh, and let me move myself somewhere else.

1162
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,100
Where should I go?

1163
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,840
I'm kind of just peeking out like a weirdo.

1164
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,600
What

1165
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,090
if I go here instead?

1166
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:39,210
What if I'm upside down?

1167
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,250
What if I...

1168
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:43,170
Hmm...

1169
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,340
There's no bloons up here.

1170
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,800
Right?

1171
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,670
Australian stream now.

1172
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:09,470
Dang!

1173
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,550
She goes so hard.

1174
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:18,010
I'm gonna put another one.

1175
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,270
Preemptive sub.

1176
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,550
Detective Jones, thanks for the gift!

1177
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:25,030
This is hush money.

1178
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,850
Not to wish Weepin a happy birthday for the next 10 months.

1179
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,650
Him suffering is really funny.

1180
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:32,550
Oh!

1181
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,950
Is this hush money to not weepin?

1182
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:35,950
What's wrong with...

1183
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,810
Hey Minto, can we get a tiny Minto in every corner?

1184
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:41,910
Fine!

1185
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:42,910
Thanks for the 10th gift!

1186
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:43,490
Thank you!

1187
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,770
Minto finally came to Australia!

1188
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:47,370
Yippee!

1189
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,310
Stinky!

1190
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,570
I don't wanna be here next to you guys anymore.

1191
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,350
This area smells!

1192
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,090
Where should I go?

1193
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:01,830
Woah!

1194
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,880
I'll just be like a big body here.

1195
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,220
I don't know what else to do.

1196
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,980
Wait, I'm kinda crooked.

1197
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,630
Is this crooked or not?

1198
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,690
I feel crooked no matter what I'm at.

1199
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,440
That was better.

1200
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:37,800
That was better.

1201
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,320
Okay, I'll just stand here.

1202
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,600
Don't touch me!

1203
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,760
Don't, don't point fingers at me.

1204
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:48,980
Don't poke me.

1205
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,320
Don't.

1206
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,480
Don't.

1207
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,140
You're not allowed.

1208
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,340
Normal day of Minto in her front yard.

1209
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,380
Wait, you can remove these!

1210
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,420
That's me in the window.

1211
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,660
Right there.

1212
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,080
You know.

1213
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,500
Just normal things.

1214
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,580
Stop!

1215
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,620
Stop pointing at me!

1216
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:09,780
Stop!

1217
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:10,640
Stop pointing at me!

1218
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,240
Stop!

1219
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,140
I'm stepping on the balloons.

1220
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,420
Yeah.

1221
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,500
With my high heels.

1222
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,150
Poke the Minto!

1223
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:28,510
Stop it!

1224
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:29,830
Stop it!

1225
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,050
Stop it!

1226
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,670
I wonder where I should have put her instead.

1227
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,210
Did you say hi?

1228
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:38,710
Okay.

1229
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:40,250
Even better!

1230
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,890
Even better!

1231
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:43,190
Even better!

1232
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,770
Are we breaking cafe rules?

1233
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,130
Yeah, actually.

1234
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:49,350
Made cafe rules?

1235
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,470
You're not supposed to touch the maze.

1236
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,710
Full of jelly.

1237
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,850
I actually am.

1238
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:56,530
Whoa!

1239
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:58,370
Thanks, Kinky!

1240
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:04,070
Peels.

1241
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:07,370
Yeah, I had so much jelly.

1242
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,850
I had so many vitamin jellies.

1243
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:12,510
Oh, I have a jelly right here!

1244
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:13,910
Hold on.

1245
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,030
Actually, I can barely taste it.

1246
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:16,630
It's so sad.

1247
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:20,170
I lost most of my taste, you guys.

1248
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:24,850
I'm having like the full COVID experience.

1249
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:25,450
It sucks.

1250
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:29,910
Can I smell it?

1251
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:31,730
Yeah, I can smell it.

1252
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,320
I can taste it.

1253
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,480
Cognac.

1254
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,160
Grape jelly.

1255
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:44,880
Oh, sorry.

1256
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,400
Jelly grape.

1257
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:54,070
It's funny because when we...

1258
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,490
When Matara and I were eating out of place...

1259
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,650
We went to Kula Sushi.

1260
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:05,250
And...

1261
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:10,190
She was like, God, the sushi here is so bad.

1262
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,370
The sushi here sucks.

1263
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:14,410
This just has no flavor.

1264
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:16,690
This was before we knew.

1265
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:22,350
She was just like...

1266
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:25,730
She was just like...

1267
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:26,670
She was just like...

1268
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,390
Later on...

1269
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:30,710
Even after she...

1270
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:34,630
Even after she knew that she had COVID, she was just like...

1271
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,810
All my food here has...

1272
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:38,610
Usually, I never have...

1273
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:44,790
Usually, I never have bad food experiences in Japan.

1274
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,490
But this time, everything's been mid.

1275
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:48,690
I'm like, girl, are you...

1276
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:54,250
I was like, Matara, think for two seconds why that would be...

1277
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,290
In our current situation.

1278
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,660
Oh, man.

1279
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,300
Mission successful.

1280
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,680
Join the Diamond Dogs.

1281
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,180
MGSCon volunteers now.

1282
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:08,700
See you there.

1283
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:09,580
Yeah.

1284
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:09,660
Yay!

1285
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,280
Congrats!

1286
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:21,340
She's like, think for two seconds why you may not be smelling or tasting stuff well.

1287
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,540
So silly.

1288
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:34,410
Look, I've been working on my upgrades and stuff.

1289
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,390
I'm kind of in the way, sorry.

1290
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:41,170
But I will almost have enough to unlock this whole thing.

1291
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:41,410
But I will almost have enough to unlock this whole thing.

1292
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:43,810
But I will almost have enough to unlock this whole thing.

1293
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:44,130
Whoa, what's this?

1294
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:47,690
Whoa!

1295
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,810
I don't know what just happened, but...

1296
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:51,270
Nice.

1297
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:53,750
Did she figure it out?

1298
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:55,590
Yeah, eventually, you know.

1299
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:04,350
My boy Darcy is always fighting with this Elizabeth chick and everybody thinks they hate each other.

1300
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:07,730
But I can see sparks whenever he's with her.

1301
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,230
Should I tell her to just confess to her?

1302
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:11,410
Should I tell her to just confess to her?

1303
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:13,450
What are you, Cupid over here?

1304
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:17,170
If it goes south, they're gonna blame you, man.

1305
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:21,190
Do you want that blood on your hands?

1306
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,580
Someone say my name.

1307
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,720
Welcome back, Minto.

1308
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,380
Thank you!

1309
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,240
Chill for Ice Monkey.

1310
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,300
What if we did only Ice Monkey?

1311
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,220
I don't have enough for Ice Monkey.

1312
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,240
I have to save up for Ice Monkey.

1313
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,220
I'm

1314
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,770
gonna put an Ice Monkey in the corner.

1315
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:59,270
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

1316
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,490
I'm gonna put him right next to me.

1317
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:03,950
Hey, Ice Monkey.

1318
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,010
Look at him juggle.

1319
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:11,570
Oh my god, the monkey's juggling above my head.

1320
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:22,010
There goes my little bloons.

1321
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:25,630
Useless monkey.

1322
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:29,030
Oh my god, he has so much XP from doing nothing.

1323
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:34,000
Oh my god, he has so much XP from doing nothing.

1324
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,200
Is this focus?

1325
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,100
I absolutely am.

1326
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,740
I think we'll do this one as the heats.

1327
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:41,020
And this one as the twin guns.

1328
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,900
I love when he spins really fast.

1329
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,320
When he juggles really fast.

1330
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:50,800
It's so funny.

1331
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,280
I clapped when I saw Ice Monkey.

1332
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,060
They showed MGS Delta trailer.

1333
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,140
I thought it was Ace Combat.

1334
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,700
They showed the planes.

1335
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:02,560
Hahaha.

1336
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,200
I'm sorry.

1337
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,920
That scene is so iconic though.

1338
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,980
Had to have been Delta.

1339
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,680
Oh yeah, Metal Gear.

1340
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,480
It's so weird.

1341
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,880
Because usually I wake up.

1342
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,780
I wake up, right?

1343
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:24,060
And I see news about idols or something.

1344
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,720
But this time it was the complete opposite.

1345
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,940
I woke up and I saw news about Metal Gear.

1346
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:29,700
So...

1347
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,920
It was kind of a...

1348
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,380
Strange situation.

1349
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:35,980
Strange situation.

1350
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,240
Where I'm like, wow.

1351
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,520
It's like...

1352
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,920
Very opposite.

1353
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,740
Dang, she's slicing and dicing.

1354
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,320
I like that she gets camo balloons too.

1355
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:52,660
It's great.

1356
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,120
But I'm so...

1357
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,480
I'm so sad.

1358
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,100
I got the deluxe edition.

1359
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:02,100
I got the deluxe edition.

1360
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,320
Um...

1361
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,060
Wait a second.

1362
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,140
How are like...

1363
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:10,060
They hitting balloons over here when they're faced this way?

1364
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,760
Why are the...

1365
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:13,400
Why is...

1366
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,520
Why is there stuff flying around?

1367
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,940
What is going on?

1368
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,660
Did you get the terrarium?

1369
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,660
No, I got...

1370
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,660
I got the deluxe one.

1371
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,860
Which was the one for the UK.

1372
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,660
Oh, it tracks.

1373
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,740
The darts are homing?

1374
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:30,460
They are?

1375
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,240
No way.

1376
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,720
But yeah.

1377
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:52,140
Since they released the collector's edition...

1378
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:54,140
At like 4 AM, I was asleep.

1379
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,260
I did not get it.

1380
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:56,740
Unfortunately.

1381
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,120
I'm so, so sad.

1382
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,920
But I think they'll re-release more.

1383
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,420
I just have to be vigilant.

1384
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,560
For uh...

1385
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,940
For whenever that comes out, you know?

1386
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:10,780
But it was so unlucky.

1387
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:11,660
But it was so unlucky.

1388
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,200
So is the collection actually sold out?

1389
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:14,960
For now, yeah.

1390
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:19,060
But like I said, I think they'll...

1391
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:19,960
I hope...

1392
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,180
Hopefully that's not just copium.

1393
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,560
But I truly think they'll release more.

1394
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,300
You can click spacebar to do the next...

1395
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:34,720
Oh my gosh!

1396
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,060
You're right!

1397
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:35,440
Wow!

1398
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,560
I didn't know you could click spacebar to do the next round.

1399
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:38,900
Thanks.

1400
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:40,660
Hehehehe.

1401
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,490
Just have all your friends ping you on Discord...

1402
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,430
When they restock it.

1403
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:51,190
I don't think...

1404
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:52,350
Anyone...

1405
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,410
Is uh...

1406
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:58,090
Um...

1407
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:01,570
I think you guys ping me more...

1408
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,050
On Twitter than on...

1409
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:04,830
Than my friends would ping me.

1410
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:05,850
Hahaha.

1411
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,420
I think you guys ping me more...

1412
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,640
On Twitter than anyone else.

1413
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:14,720
Let's see.

1414
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,100
Let's...

1415
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,460
I like getting this guy in.

1416
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,420
I'm gonna put him over here.

1417
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,560
And we'll start getting in...

1418
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,320
This.

1419
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,460
Cause I really like this one.

1420
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,240
What's the second upgrade?

1421
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:30,560
Oh.

1422
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,220
Gains 10 attacks...

1423
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,920
10% attack speed for 1% life.

1424
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,360
Wasn't watching the stream but I got...

1425
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,800
Gifted a notif...

1426
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:43,040
Oh!

1427
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:44,440
Notification of a gifted member!

1428
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,600
Big thanks for...

1429
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,940
Well thanks for dropping by!

1430
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:48,580
Thanks for...

1431
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,440
Trying to have to do that!

1432
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:52,660
Thank you though!

1433
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:53,720
Thank you!

1434
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,820
How you... How you doing up there?

1435
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:01,400
Ice monkey!

1436
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,260
Can you give us a juggle?

1437
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,280
Give us a little wave!

1438
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,440
Yippee!

1439
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,640
Ping me more!

1440
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,740
I accidentally woke up my boyfriend...

1441
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,480
Because you kept making me laugh out loud.

1442
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:20,960
Tyro!

1443
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:25,360
Oh my gosh!

1444
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:26,500
Stop lolling!

1445
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,700
Stop raffling on my jokes!

1446
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,700
Stop lolling so much!

1447
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,140
Lol lol lol!

1448
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,680
Raffle raffle raffle!

1449
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:47,100
Raffle raffle raffle raffle!

1450
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,200
Uh oh!

1451
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,520
Oh no!

1452
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:56,600
I didn't mean to put him there!

1453
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,340
Uh oh!

1454
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:58,440
Oh no!

1455
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:58,440
I didn't mean to put him there!

1456
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:59,380
That was close!

1457
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,280
Let's do it!

1458
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,620
Why didn't they...

1459
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:19,860
Why didn't they get those...

1460
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,620
Those ones though?

1461
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:23,580
I know... I...

1462
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:26,320
Can they not get the...

1463
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,560
Oh maybe they don't...

1464
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,520
Maybe I didn't do the...

1465
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,680
What's the words on them?

1466
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,440
The camel...

1467
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,840
Boop boop!

1468
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,400
Boop boop!

1469
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:40,440
Hope you were able to receive my gift.

1470
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:43,220
The...

1471
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:43,380
The...

1472
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,000
Um...

1473
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,160
A figure!

1474
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:47,960
I'll have to check.

1475
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:50,300
From Afkai!

1476
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:55,010
They haven't...

1477
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,330
They haven't sent the stuff yet.

1478
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:58,410
They said that they'll let us know when they sent it.

1479
01:07:58,550 --> 01:07:59,490
From Afkai.

1480
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:06,110
But they haven't shipped them to us yet.

1481
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:12,360
But they haven't shipped them to us yet.

1482
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,160
Have I made a mistake?

1483
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,440
What, like the game?

1484
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:15,520
Blue Archive!

1485
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:17,160
Yippee!

1486
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,240
Oh no, I love Blue Archive.

1487
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,220
I'm gonna plant a tree.

1488
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,520
Oh wait, I'm gonna plant it right behind him.

1489
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,440
Put it in your radius.

1490
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:31,560
Oh!

1491
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,580
But I was really bad about keeping up while I was gone.

1492
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,880
That was the volume by the way guys.

1493
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:50,540
Is it too loud?

1494
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,200
Just let me know.

1495
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,840
In fact, I'm gonna turn it down just a tad.

1496
01:08:59,080 --> 01:08:59,780
Handle it!

1497
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,160
Oh!

1498
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,420
I thought we almost lost.

1499
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:05,760
Okay, there we go.

1500
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,340
Hmm, louder.

1501
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,140
Was that it?

1502
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:21,020
Um...

1503
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,280
Where should we...

1504
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:25,180
Hmm...

1505
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:29,610
Hmm...

1506
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:31,130
I gotta maybe get rid of these trees.

1507
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,590
For five hundred dollars!

1508
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:35,710
Craziness.

1509
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:38,030
Let's make some more money.

1510
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:40,610
Oh yeah.

1511
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:42,490
Let's do that too.

1512
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:47,350
No jacket?

1513
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:50,130
It was a limited jacket made by Alpha Industries for the collab.

1514
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:51,190
Oh, no way!

1515
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:51,470
Really?

1516
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:52,750
That's awesome.

1517
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,570
Five hundred dollar monkey bucks.

1518
01:09:58,270 --> 01:09:59,670
I love sniper monkey.

1519
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:00,250
Me too!

1520
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:01,930
I love sniper monkey.

1521
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:05,290
Gift of ten!

1522
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:06,830
Thank you, Peculiar!

1523
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:08,330
Thank you so much!

1524
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:11,770
Oh!

1525
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:13,270
Okay, now we have lots of money.

1526
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:16,070
Look at them carts!

1527
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:23,140
We're doing a little bit of lawn maintenance in my maid cafe.

1528
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,780
And good news, I got my Mintara Mondays goods and bad news.

1529
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,640
My desk chair broke.

1530
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,760
Sorry your Japan trip was a bust.

1531
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:33,800
Hope you feel better soon.

1532
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,360
Thank you!

1533
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,220
I'm sorry.

1534
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:38,980
Your...

1535
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:43,200
chair broke though.

1536
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,220
Okay, now we can do sniper monkey.

1537
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,480
Because he can see everywhere.

1538
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,700
I'm gonna line him up all here.

1539
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,760
A line of sniper monkeys.

1540
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,460
Oh, that's not a sniper monkey.

1541
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,640
Well, it would be nice to get this guy.

1542
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:01,760
Maybe I could put him like...

1543
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,460
I wish I could put him at the end.

1544
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:04,860
You know?

1545
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,560
We'll put one sniper monkey there.

1546
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,660
One sniper monkey there.

1547
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,740
And you're gonna be our fast sniper monkey.

1548
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,020
And you're gonna be our...

1549
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:17,540
full metal sniper monkey.

1550
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:21,900
Sniper monkey!

1551
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,740
And we'll have Levi.

1552
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:25,620
And even more sniper monkeys.

1553
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,200
So many sniper monkeys.

1554
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,660
Thought it would have been best on a corner.

1555
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,640
Yeah, I didn't realize how this map worked.

1556
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:34,360
But that's okay.

1557
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:35,900
You know what?

1558
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,060
I was gonna say live and learn.

1559
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:39,900
But I'm dead.

1560
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,940
So, I just don't learn.

1561
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,020
I never learn.

1562
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:57,940
What's this one?

1563
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,100
I've leveled up to this one before.

1564
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:06,470
Super fast monkey.

1565
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,600
We are...

1566
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,060
Actually, maybe I wanna...

1567
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,900
Let's collect this and upgrade you.

1568
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:20,540
There we go.

1569
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,000
And you.

1570
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,060
Perfect.

1571
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:26,960
Big sub.

1572
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,340
Is it a big ol' submarine?

1573
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,440
This one?

1574
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,160
Oh, wait.

1575
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,600
I should add more subs then.

1576
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,180
Shouldn't I?

1577
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:36,120
Let's add more.

1578
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,160
Let's add another little guy here.

1579
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,730
Maybe I should do this one then.

1580
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:46,650
I'll go this route.

1581
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:47,530
But I can't...

1582
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,070
Oh, I can almost unlock it!

1583
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,770
I might be able to unlock it soon.

1584
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,340
Yeti, welcome back.

1585
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:01,740
Thank you!

1586
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,420
Full sub squad.

1587
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,660
Well, this guy is not a sub.

1588
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:09,960
He's an alpha.

1589
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:12,560
Moeb!

1590
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:13,760
Moeb!

1591
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,620
What's she say?

1592
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:19,640
Oh my gosh.

1593
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:20,800
I'm being covered!

1594
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,100
By notifications.

1595
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:27,300
I'm also stepping on the banks.

1596
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,920
I take that, banks!

1597
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,080
But yeah, how were you guys while I was gone?

1598
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,180
What happened?

1599
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:40,160
Did you...

1600
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,280
Did you miss me?

1601
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,600
What'd you do?

1602
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,720
Did anything interesting happen?

1603
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,560
Saw it as Korean, I think.

1604
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,280
Oh, really?

1605
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:49,960
Okay.

1606
01:13:58,180 --> 01:13:58,580
Hmm.

1607
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,000
Trying to decide what I want to upgrade.

1608
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,840
If I want to upgrade any sniper monkeys, or if I want to upgrade...

1609
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:07,140
Let's do this one.

1610
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:07,680
I do.

1611
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:09,200
Oh my god, it's so full.

1612
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,060
Look at these guys go.

1613
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:13,600
They're so cute.

1614
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,740
I graduated school!

1615
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:18,280
Let's go!

1616
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,440
I got a 3D printer.

1617
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,680
What are you planning on doing with that?

1618
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,560
Watched game trailers.

1619
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,300
There's a lot of great games coming out.

1620
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:35,700
I mean, with Delta and...

1621
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,780
I mean, Metal Gear.

1622
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:38,600
Metal Gear is Delta.

1623
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,700
But Delta and the Indiana Jones game.

1624
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,860
I can't wait for that too.

1625
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,660
I'm so excited.

1626
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,220
I'm so excited.

1627
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,380
I'm so excited.

1628
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:50,000
I believe my Ace Combat 7 save replayed the entire game.

1629
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,780
You got this.

1630
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,480
Wait, you finished it today?

1631
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:56,600
Never mind.

1632
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,720
You did got it.

1633
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,320
All I did was sit in a room staring at the awl.

1634
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,160
All I did was sit in a room staring at the awl.

1635
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,780
Metal Gear.

1636
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:06,720
Also Metal Gear.

1637
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:07,780
There's so much Metal Gear.

1638
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,780
I got the vinyl records this morning.

1639
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:12,400
I'm very excited about those.

1640
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:13,380
Oh my goodness.

1641
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,960
I can't wait to get into video game vinyls.

1642
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,880
This is the perfect opportunity to start, baby.

1643
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:22,700
So...

1644
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:23,320
Oh, yippee!

1645
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:26,740
Wall.

1646
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,580
No, you said awl.

1647
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,600
I started my internship while you were gone.

1648
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:32,700
Wow.

1649
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,220
Look at you.

1650
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,240
You're being productive in society.

1651
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,460
You're being productive in society.

1652
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:40,880
Oh, what's this?

1653
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:41,380
What's this?

1654
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:46,280
Wow!

1655
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,580
My truck broke down.

1656
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:51,640
I spent two days in a rest area in the mountains in the middle of nowhere.

1657
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,780
Are you okay?

1658
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,260
Are you okay?

1659
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:56,840
Are you okay?

1660
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,020
Got my associates...

1661
01:15:59,020 --> 01:15:59,540
Wait.

1662
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:00,460
Associates.

1663
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,180
Is that associates?

1664
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,120
AA degree.

1665
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,580
Is that associates right?

1666
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:08,220
Congratulations!

1667
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:09,340
I got a degree!

1668
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:14,640
I did this run after I came back from off clay.

1669
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,440
You're so fast.

1670
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:20,420
You're so fast.

1671
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:21,860
Sounds like an I survived story.

1672
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:22,820
For real, right?

1673
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:23,940
Are you actually okay?

1674
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:25,700
I'm fast!

1675
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,160
Are you actually okay?

1676
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:30,800
Oh.

1677
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,400
I forgot to collect my money.

1678
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:41,900
Um...

1679
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:42,560
But yeah.

1680
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,220
Oh, let's see.

1681
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,660
What should we upgrade this one to?

1682
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:45,720
Oh, I can upgrade!

1683
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:46,520
Oh, dang it.

1684
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,020
No, just kidding.

1685
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:47,920
I have 31.

1686
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:50,560
Um...

1687
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,140
You know what?

1688
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:52,880
I am gonna try this one.

1689
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:54,800
Go down.

1690
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,400
But what's the point of getting these?

1691
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:00,220
But what's the point of getting these?

1692
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:02,020
If it doesn't shoot while it's submerged, right?

1693
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:02,480
If it doesn't shoot while it's submerged, right?

1694
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:05,340
Hmm...

1695
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:11,310
Um...

1696
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:12,550
But now that I'm back...

1697
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:14,070
Uh...

1698
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:16,150
Um...

1699
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:17,530
Let's see.

1700
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:20,230
Oh, nice!

1701
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:21,250
I can unlock this one.

1702
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:22,530
Which I have all...

1703
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:22,710
Whoa!

1704
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:25,810
The more bloons there are, the more damage it does.

1705
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:27,190
Um...

1706
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:28,750
That sounds pretty good for...

1707
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:31,270
Oh, monkey-nomics!

1708
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:32,310
I can finally unlock that!

1709
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:35,230
Um...

1710
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:36,230
Oh, gosh.

1711
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:38,250
Now that I'm back...

1712
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,150
I'll be honest.

1713
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:45,090
There's been things that I've been trying to handle.

1714
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:51,590
There's been things that I've been trying to handle.

1715
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:51,970
But...

1716
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:52,490
Um...

1717
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:55,990
Things have been kind of...

1718
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:58,490
Hmm...

1719
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:00,530
It's been not so...

1720
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:01,790
I don't wanna say not so great.

1721
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:04,370
Just a lot of things were like...

1722
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:06,530
Things that I'm hoping will be done...

1723
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:07,510
By a certain time.

1724
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:09,150
And I don't think they will be.

1725
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:11,730
So...

1726
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:13,410
Um...

1727
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:15,610
It's been a process.

1728
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:16,770
I mean, this is...

1729
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:18,930
What happens when you're indie, you know?

1730
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:20,490
Um...

1731
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,120
Uh...

1732
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,620
It's been a learning process for sure.

1733
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:32,920
I'll say that.

1734
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,100
It's been a learning process.

1735
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,920
Find a decent turntable in the 200...

1736
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,060
300, 400 range.

1737
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,080
I saw...

1738
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:41,740
Um...

1739
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,420
I saw an Audio-Technica one that I was looking at.

1740
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,760
Would you recommend?

1741
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,020
Hold on, let me see it.

1742
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,140
If I still have it pulled up.

1743
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,600
It was an Audio-Technica...

1744
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,220
Um...

1745
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,820
It was in purple.

1746
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:01,700
It was in purple.

1747
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:02,460
I kinda liked it.

1748
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:05,300
A lilac.

1749
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:08,480
ATLP60XBT.

1750
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:09,160
ATLP60XBT.

1751
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:11,020
Maybe.

1752
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,740
I like Audio-Technica in general.

1753
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:16,200
I like Audio-Technica in general.

1754
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:16,560
So...

1755
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,380
I figured maybe going with them would be a good choice, right?

1756
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:23,600
Perhaps.

1757
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,260
Maybe.

1758
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:27,420
Those are a safe bet.

1759
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:31,400
Hmm...

1760
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:31,900
Hmm...

1761
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,580
Let me guess...

1762
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:34,340
A little overwhelming?

1763
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:38,120
Well basically I was trying to like...

1764
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,960
Get a...

1765
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,080
Somewhat of a...

1766
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,000
Merch launch...

1767
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:46,060
Merch line up...

1768
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:47,600
For my anniversary.

1769
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,080
Um...

1770
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,580
But one thing that I was like...

1771
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:56,040
Most excited about...

1772
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,620
The person that I...

1773
01:19:58,220 --> 01:19:58,620
Was working with.

1774
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,980
They came back...

1775
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,580
Just a couple days ago.

1776
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,080
And they were like...

1777
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:08,060
A lot of factories didn't want to work with us because of a certain thing.

1778
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:09,580
Um...

1779
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:10,820
So...

1780
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:11,820
Um...

1781
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,480
But I finally found a factory.

1782
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,380
I'll get back to you in...

1783
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:17,860
In 30 days.

1784
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,120
And I was like...

1785
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,840
30... 30 days?

1786
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,360
Oh...

1787
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:22,380
Oh...

1788
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:26,860
So...

1789
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:28,420
Uh...

1790
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:30,900
Yeah...

1791
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:36,140
I dropped one K on a commission and my artist just...

1792
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:36,980
Ghosted me?

1793
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,100
No!

1794
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,740
File a dispute with your bank!

1795
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:43,540
If that happens...

1796
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:52,370
What's this?

1797
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:53,010
Oh!

1798
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:54,390
We can make them raise up!

1799
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:56,310
Wait...

1800
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:56,610
So...

1801
01:20:59,290 --> 01:20:59,830
Wait...

1802
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:01,630
How is it popping balloons if it's submerged?

1803
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:05,730
I'm confused.

1804
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:08,410
Since you asked, I passed my exam yesterday.

1805
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:08,910
Let's go!

1806
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:11,550
Wait...

1807
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,230
Can anybody help me with this one?

1808
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:14,010
Oh!

1809
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:14,810
Radiation!

1810
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:15,230
Oh...

1811
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:17,410
Oh...

1812
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:21,310
I say... I say...

1813
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:24,130
Reduces ability cooldowns everywhere by 20%.

1814
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:24,250
Reduces ability cooldowns everywhere by 20%.

1815
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,070
Not a whole deal.

1816
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:28,330
Not a whole deal.

1817
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:28,830
Yay!

1818
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:46,830
Maybe I shouldn't have upgraded these monkeys the exact same.

1819
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:47,110
Maybe I shouldn't have upgraded these monkeys the exact same.

1820
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:47,530
But it's fine.

1821
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:50,830
I just realized my mistake.

1822
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:52,090
But it's okay.

1823
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:56,690
This one...

1824
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:58,370
Come on!

1825
01:21:58,570 --> 01:21:59,170
Come on!

1826
01:21:59,410 --> 01:21:59,930
There we go!

1827
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:05,270
Whisp Sweatshop to produce merch soon.

1828
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:05,670
No!

1829
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:08,250
I'm just hoping that...

1830
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:09,350
You know...

1831
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:10,470
That...

1832
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:17,730
You guys aren't gonna be disappointed by a lack of stuff.

1833
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:20,510
Like you're just...

1834
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:22,190
I hope that you guys won't be like...

1835
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:24,870
Man, is Mint doing anything at all?

1836
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:27,250
She hasn't put out this or that or this or that.

1837
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:27,570
She hasn't put out this or that or this or that.

1838
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:29,990
I'm just a little worried about it.

1839
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:30,630
I'm just a little worried about it.

1840
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:34,390
Audio Technic is a good brand.

1841
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:36,230
That model you mentioned looks okay.

1842
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:38,530
It's not crazy about the belt drive on it though.

1843
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:40,930
What?

1844
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:42,290
Will that like kill my...

1845
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,090
Records?

1846
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,060
My web!

1847
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:53,480
Wow!

1848
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,100
We're like killing it, aren't we?

1849
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,280
Just you having fun is good enough for us?

1850
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,280
I don't know...

1851
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,440
I still want you guys to like...

1852
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,760
You know, be like...

1853
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:11,820
Oh!

1854
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,240
Mint does such cool things.

1855
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,140
It's just been a little slow.

1856
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:24,660
That's all.

1857
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,280
Relax if you need to.

1858
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:28,740
No!

1859
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,080
You can always offer pre-orders.

1860
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:35,220
Yeah, I was thinking of that.

1861
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,480
Well, I mean, they'd probably have to be pre-orders anyway.

1862
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:38,360
But...

1863
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,540
I kind of have to solidify...

1864
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,240
What...

1865
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,560
What I'm doing at all.

1866
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,540
I have to solidify anything at this rate.

1867
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:51,720
But you know...

1868
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,140
I'm doing my best.

1869
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:58,100
I want to get this one.

1870
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,420
The Spirit of the Forest.

1871
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:06,290
Don't jump to the worst conclusions.

1872
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:06,910
Don't jump to the worst conclusions.

1873
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:07,590
What do you mean by that?

1874
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:15,380
Look at this guy.

1875
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,140
Look at this guy up here.

1876
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,180
He's like...

1877
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:23,820
He's so fast.

1878
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:27,500
What else should I build?

1879
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:28,880
Oh my gosh, thank you for that!

1880
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,200
It appears we meet again, Mint Monkey.

1881
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,200
Nice to see my boy hiding in the corner.

1882
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:36,300
Clutching the game.

1883
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,460
How much experience do you think he has?

1884
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,360
4000!

1885
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,980
By doing absolutely nothing.

1886
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:44,200
What a champ.

1887
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,580
What a champ my guy is.

1888
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:57,580
Click on the sub upgrades again.

1889
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,360
I have ever...

1890
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:00,580
Oh!

1891
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,320
I was going to say I have everything!

1892
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,340
One million...

1893
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:05,220
What is this?

1894
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,900
Unfathomable range, power, and synergies with other monkey towers and heroes puts all bloons under assault.

1895
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:13,800
Four...

1896
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,960
Four hundred...

1897
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,760
What is this?

1898
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:17,980
I've never seen this before.

1899
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:20,620
Nautic Siege Core.

1900
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:21,920
What?

1901
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,800
Thank you, Red.

1902
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,160
Thanks for two months.

1903
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,460
One million XP.

1904
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,160
One million XP.

1905
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,820
Hold on, I'm going to eat some of my...

1906
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:35,320
Oh, I'm starting to feel a little bit dizzy.

1907
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,300
Oh, hold on.

1908
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:48,980
I don't get nausea.

1909
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,200
My friend, when she got COVID, she said she was really nauseous.

1910
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,240
I don't get nausea, but...

1911
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,420
I get lightheaded a little bit.

1912
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,680
Don't be afraid to ask your friends for help or advice.

1913
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:09,320
Yeah.

1914
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:11,400
Um...

1915
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,540
I think for me, it's like...

1916
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:19,240
There are things that I want to do, but I can't figure out a way how to get them made.

1917
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:23,980
I might have to contact a place directly and get it custom.

1918
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,260
But also it's me being like, I want to do something cool.

1919
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:28,740
But...

1920
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,580
My limitations...

1921
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:32,600
Are low right now.

1922
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:34,740
My limit...

1923
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:36,140
Yeah, my limitations are...

1924
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:38,280
Restrict...

1925
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,280
I have limitations.

1926
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:42,620
I'm here, but...

1927
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,400
Oh Bro...

1928
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:46,900
We are here for you.

1929
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,920
Don't sweat it, there's a cherry standing around here.

1930
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:50,440
Wow.

1931
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,220
Go Moab!

1932
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:54,620
Moab!

1933
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,140
Hans elevate.

1934
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,580
Hans elevate rules!

1935
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:00,040
Hooray!

1936
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:00,600
Run to take the money.

1937
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,420
Oh, yeah.

1938
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:06,880
100?

1939
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,260
What do you mean by that?

1940
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,640
Why is it so expensive?

1941
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,440
I've never seen that much monkey money before, ever!

1942
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:18,220
I told Darcy to confess to Elizabeth.

1943
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:21,400
She rebuked the F out of him.

1944
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,140
See, I told you.

1945
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,600
I told you!

1946
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:35,890
Dang, that was fast.

1947
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:37,610
I got sick even before I went to Ofukai.

1948
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:38,590
Oh my gosh, no!

1949
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:41,010
Everybody feel better.

1950
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:43,410
Belt drive won't damage your records.

1951
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:46,370
Just try not to touch the record while it's spinning or you'll wear the belt out.

1952
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:47,610
Ah, okay, okay.

1953
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:50,050
Direct drive doesn't have that problem.

1954
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:52,310
I see, I see, I see.

1955
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:54,130
Oh my gosh, thank you guys for all the superchats!

1956
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:54,530
Thank you!

1957
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:59,150
What flavor of block game would you play with Bessie Bird?

1958
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:01,110
I don't know.

1959
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:04,130
She and I should talk about it, now that I'm back.

1960
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:09,410
I hope you're getting over the crud quickly.

1961
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:10,990
I think I would say I'm honest.

1962
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:13,310
I don't want to spend the recovery end.

1963
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:16,470
I would say that I didn't feel so bad for a very long time.

1964
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:19,290
Especially once I started taking medicine, I was like, Oh yeah!

1965
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:22,150
Oh yeah, I feel so good!

1966
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:26,630
Mostly it was my head hurting.

1967
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:28,350
My head was like...

1968
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:30,750
Oh, it was like so...

1969
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:31,170
Oh!

1970
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:33,210
It was so bad!

1971
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:36,890
But now, I feel...

1972
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:39,490
My head hasn't hurt at all.

1973
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:42,650
Mental...

1974
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:45,830
That's a word.

1975
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:49,070
That's a word.

1976
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:50,490
I see I want this guy real bad.

1977
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:52,850
How do I...

1978
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:54,530
What's the best way to make money, you guys?

1979
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:57,030
What's the best way to make monkey bucks?

1980
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:58,430
I don't want to take out a loan.

1981
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:00,030
I don't want to be in debt to anybody.

1982
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:02,590
Maybe I should build another bank.

1983
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:09,100
Payments missed you.

1984
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,140
I missed you guys!

1985
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:12,520
Banks?

1986
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:13,620
Okay, let's make a bank.

1987
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:18,470
I'm gonna put it right...

1988
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:19,690
Is it still in range of him?

1989
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:20,610
I think so.

1990
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:22,330
Maybe, technically.

1991
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:27,190
See, this one I don't want to go because...

1992
01:29:27,190 --> 01:29:27,330
Wait.

1993
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:29,710
Earned heaps of money each round.

1994
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:31,390
What's a merchant man?

1995
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:34,710
Hopes of monkeys trail.

1996
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:36,570
Huh.

1997
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:38,210
Huh.

1998
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:41,830
Which is the best path to go?

1999
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:44,330
Rob a monkey bank.

2000
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:50,690
Which is the best path, you think?

2001
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:53,450
Sorry, MGS.

2002
01:29:53,530 --> 01:29:55,590
Because of you, I just beat MGS2 and loving it.

2003
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,650
I'm a Steam achievements fan, though.

2004
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,330
Getting big boss code name took years.

2005
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:00,990
I'm sorry, Fizz.

2006
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:02,550
It's not even something I'll do.

2007
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:08,390
Reminds me of a silly anime girl on the internet quote.

2008
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:09,170
No expectations.

2009
01:30:09,850 --> 01:30:10,230
Yeah!

2010
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:14,270
Bottom path?

2011
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:14,710
Seriously?

2012
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:16,970
You like the bottom path?

2013
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:19,910
But it halves your value.

2014
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:24,590
We'll try it.

2015
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:32,300
So it just collects in there?

2016
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:35,840
Or something?

2017
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,080
We're working on our aim.

2018
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:44,360
Yeah, what's that supposed to mean?

2019
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:47,040
What's that supposed to mean?

2020
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:53,180
Something.

2021
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:04,140
Yeah, that's what it means.

2022
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:06,380
It means you have to pass the time, right?

2023
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:08,160
How long do I need to deal with it?

2024
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:09,260
Oh, I see.

2025
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:09,280
And then I'll pass it.

2026
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:09,940
If I get the secret, I can't get out.

2027
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:10,080
If you try it out, it'll be better.

2028
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,540
But I don't like what I'm doing.

2029
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,640
I'm gonna make it better.

2030
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,160
I'm not gonna practice.

2031
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,440
I'm not gonna practice.

2032
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:15,440
What?

2033
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,400
Those are just normal cats.

2034
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,000
Right?

2035
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,460
If you think about it.

2036
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:27,900
Yo, we are like killing it right now.

2037
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,280
Maybe I should take out a loan for real.

2038
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:34,780
Marketplace.

2039
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:36,880
Wow,

2040
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:41,120
look at it go!

2041
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:42,600
Sorry.

2042
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,000
Let's do the more valuable.

2043
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:52,460
ZOMG!

2044
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:54,980
That was easy.

2045
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,620
Duck sized cats.

2046
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:02,520
That's like the same thing.

2047
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,260
That's like the same exact thing.

2048
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,140
Oh my gosh, wait I can almost get him.

2049
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:15,560
So close.

2050
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:16,700
I'm taking out a loan!

2051
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:17,280
Just kidding.

2052
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,340
I'm going to be able to summon two phoenixes.

2053
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:24,480
I'm taking out a loan!

2054
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:27,820
Yes!

2055
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,480
Now they start...

2056
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,120
Yes, they start growing!

2057
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:38,280
They start growing!

2058
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,580
Collect that money.

2059
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:50,210
Look at it go!

2060
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:52,690
How are the kitties?

2061
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:53,690
They are so good!

2062
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:56,490
I...

2063
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:05,910
My roommate had to take Butaro to the vet.

2064
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:10,530
Duck shaped cats.

2065
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:11,570
No!

2066
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:13,070
Then they are just ducks!

2067
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:17,150
Thank you so much!

2068
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:24,410
Turns out he has maybe acid reflux and that's why he throws up all the time.

2069
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:29,830
So he has to... I had to change his diet entirely again.

2070
01:33:30,170 --> 01:33:32,750
I was like ordering food for him in Japan.

2071
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:37,530
My stupid sensitive cat.

2072
01:33:40,530 --> 01:33:42,410
Okay, maybe I can get this one now.

2073
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:47,290
I like how he just like...

2074
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:51,110
Scary, scary, scary.

2075
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,590
DDT, I don't know if we are still ready for.

2076
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:02,310
Poor old man.

2077
01:34:02,690 --> 01:34:04,290
I know, my stinky cat.

2078
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:04,430
My stinky cat.

2079
01:34:07,630 --> 01:34:09,690
He is such an old man.

2080
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:18,340
Uh oh.

2081
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,440
I'm as sharp as I get.

2082
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:27,360
Should I try this?

2083
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:29,620
I guess I tried it.

2084
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,980
Maybe I should have invested in something else.

2085
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:37,480
Oh well.

2086
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:42,920
But yeah, other than that...

2087
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:48,170
No!

2088
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:50,550
I think I would have lost that anyway though.

2089
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:53,110
I think I would have lost that anyway.

2090
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,640
My cat throws up sometimes but now I know that happens when he overeats.

2091
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:01,860
Yeah!

2092
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:03,820
That could happen.

2093
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,240
Sometimes my cat eats too fast.

2094
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:08,280
Dang.

2095
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:09,860
But hey!

2096
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:14,420
Insta monkey!

2097
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:14,620
Monkey!

2098
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:21,340
Yippee!

2099
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:25,180
The first money on an intermediate map.

2100
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:28,640
Oh monkey...

2101
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:28,960
Oh no.

2102
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:30,200
Monkey's play.

2103
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,640
That was a good one.

2104
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,740
That was a good round everybody.

2105
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:35,000
We can still do carve.

2106
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:35,900
That one is spooky also.

2107
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:43,210
Be the beginner map.

2108
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:44,830
For the first time.

2109
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:45,790
Oh we got to get...

2110
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:46,150
Yeah, yeah.

2111
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:46,730
Let's go to...

2112
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:50,890
You know what?

2113
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:52,570
Let's just keep going through these.

2114
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:55,270
We'll do this one.

2115
01:35:58,370 --> 01:36:02,170
When I see a monkey I think of Johnny Bravo.

2116
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:05,370
Throw the monkey with me.

2117
01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:07,650
Wait, how does this go?

2118
01:36:08,490 --> 01:36:09,850
They just go straight across?

2119
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:11,010
Huh?

2120
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:13,970
Do they go down?

2121
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:16,270
Huh?

2122
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:18,730
Should I...

2123
01:36:18,730 --> 01:36:19,570
Where should I put her?

2124
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:19,850
Here?

2125
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:26,560
Resort mode is really easy for Sada.

2126
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,320
Oh, it circles three times.

2127
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:30,040
Wait, huh?

2128
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,980
They loop around a few times.

2129
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:34,380
Ah.

2130
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,520
This is the easiest map in the game.

2131
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:37,820
Don't worry.

2132
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:41,960
Maybe I should have let it...

2133
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:44,080
See how it went before I even...

2134
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:44,900
Wait!

2135
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:45,420
Can I play this map?

2136
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:46,480
Can I put monkeys on these chairs?

2137
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:52,860
Oh, in the square!

2138
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,280
I'll put her there instead.

2139
01:36:58,600 --> 01:36:59,400
I'll put her there.

2140
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:02,560
Oh, yes I can!

2141
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:02,960
See?

2142
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:05,520
That's where Ice Monkey will be.

2143
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,000
Ice Monkey is going to be...

2144
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:11,440
Is going to be...

2145
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:13,180
Lounging.

2146
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,600
Yeah, Ice Monkey will be lounging in the chair.

2147
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:17,900
Ice Monkey is really good in this map.

2148
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:18,400
Okay.

2149
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:18,820
Ice Monkey is coming.

2150
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:19,920
Yeah, for lounging.

2151
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:29,670
Evin, what is that...

2152
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:31,690
What, what is that...

2153
01:37:31,690 --> 01:37:32,210
What?

2154
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:38,610
Are you okay?

2155
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,320
That tickles.

2156
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:49,440
Look at him.

2157
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,660
Oh, he's lounging.

2158
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:52,120
He's just chilling little guys.

2159
01:38:09,530 --> 01:38:11,970
We can have two ice monkeys on a date.

2160
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:19,150
Yeah, but like... ice monkey is kind of selective.

2161
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:20,950
He doesn't just go out with any ice monkey.

2162
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:28,110
Sada looks like a private chef for ice monkey right now.

2163
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:31,190
You know how they like sit in their little booths and stuff?

2164
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:36,350
She looks like a private chef slicing and dicing.

2165
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:39,190
She's doing hibachi table for ice monkey.

2166
01:38:41,090 --> 01:38:43,730
Ice monkey and fire monkey forbidden romance.

2167
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:45,570
There is no fire monkey.

2168
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:57,560
There's alchemist monkey.

2169
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:01,400
Two ice monkeys is just getting crazy.

2170
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:08,940
Some would say it's a waste of my monkey box, but um... they might be correct.

2171
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,280
I know who I want on the other table.

2172
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,300
Me.

2173
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:25,380
It's me.

2174
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,660
I'm lounging with ice monkey.

2175
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:30,040
You guys can't stop me.

2176
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:39,320
She blew my tower to lie defense.

2177
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,320
She left you defenseless man.

2178
01:39:47,970 --> 01:39:52,490
Someone come into the stream and say, where's Mito?

2179
01:39:58,100 --> 01:40:00,280
Little does ice monkey know.

2180
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:03,020
There's a poison in that drink.

2181
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:08,100
It's a matter of time before he croaks.

2182
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,080
Or... not croaks.

2183
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:12,860
Before he...

2184
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,320
Yes.

2185
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:24,180
Let's see.

2186
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,380
What else can I do here?

2187
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:32,660
Is there any magical things going on?

2188
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:33,140
Okay.

2189
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,800
Any... Let's put a... Let's put a... Let's put a boat monkey.

2190
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,540
I don't think it's the end, is it?

2191
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:56,960
Wait, if I do that, you can totally...

2192
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,780
Oh my gosh!

2193
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:59,440
I'm just standing in the middle of the room!

2194
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,480
I'm just standing here!

2195
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,460
So awkward.

2196
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:09,980
Okay, click the base of the parasol.

2197
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:10,340
Oh!

2198
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:12,660
Oh, that's so cute!

2199
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:15,840
Okay, I'm gonna go back to my normal spot.

2200
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:19,120
I feel uncomfortable.

2201
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:24,600
There we go.

2202
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:29,080
We'll put another ice monkey there.

2203
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:36,840
Some may say that's a waste of my monkey books, but...

2204
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:41,140
Ice monkey doesn't know MGS Lore, he just explained it to him.

2205
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:44,100
Click the car.

2206
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:45,780
Coconut tree.

2207
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:52,100
Was that a coconut crab?

2208
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:53,520
Oh my god!

2209
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:54,760
Good thing I got out of here!

2210
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:55,800
That thing was gonna eat me!

2211
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:57,420
Oh my gosh!

2212
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:59,360
I was about to get Amelia Earharted!

2213
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,780
Thank god I got out of there!

2214
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:07,500
No monkey!

2215
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:08,080
No monkey!

2216
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:09,660
No monkey!

2217
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:10,080
No monkey!

2218
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:10,420
No monkey!

2219
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:13,380
But down here on these three, we're gonna put sniper monkeys.

2220
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:17,140
Sniper monkeys!

2221
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:17,140
Sniper monkey!

2222
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:17,580
Where?

2223
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:18,300
Right here.

2224
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:21,600
Sniper... lounging sniper monkeys.

2225
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:23,140
Everybody's on vacation today.

2226
01:42:29,210 --> 01:42:31,770
We can do each route with each monkey.

2227
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:34,310
You here.

2228
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:37,050
And you here.

2229
01:42:38,030 --> 01:42:38,630
Perfect!

2230
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:44,610
It's a fabled beach episode.

2231
01:42:44,930 --> 01:42:46,310
Is that what happened to her?

2232
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:50,370
That's what was the theory for a while, actually.

2233
01:42:51,170 --> 01:42:53,430
Was that she got coconut crabbed.

2234
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:57,190
You just got coconut crabbed!

2235
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,350
You're getting eaten alive!

2236
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,880
Have you ever tried mortar monkeys?

2237
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:17,920
Is that this one?

2238
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:19,160
I'm not.

2239
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:20,720
You know what?

2240
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,160
Today's the day we mortar monkey.

2241
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,860
Which sounds dangerously close to murder monkey.

2242
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:34,490
Look, I like how each of them have a different hat on and everything.

2243
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:35,530
So cute.

2244
01:43:36,350 --> 01:43:37,750
So how do I use this guy?

2245
01:43:38,630 --> 01:43:40,490
I'm gonna put him right in front of their salad.

2246
01:43:43,470 --> 01:43:45,110
I just set a target, right?

2247
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:47,930
Target!

2248
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:48,110
Target!

2249
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:54,360
Kill monkey!

2250
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,460
Kill ice monkey!

2251
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:13,920
Third wheel.

2252
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:17,100
I lost a bet to Cole at offcut?

2253
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:17,980
Why?

2254
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,700
What happened?

2255
01:44:22,140 --> 01:44:23,360
Picker blast...

2256
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:23,900
Increase...

2257
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:26,040
What's the best...

2258
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,360
What's the best route for our...

2259
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:29,940
For our murder monkey?

2260
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:39,800
How could you, Minto?

2261
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:50,230
Hold on, I gotta remember which monkey is going with which direction.

2262
01:44:57,790 --> 01:44:58,310
Speed?

2263
01:44:58,310 --> 01:44:58,830
2?

2264
01:44:59,310 --> 01:45:00,490
0, 5, 2?

2265
01:45:05,730 --> 01:45:08,470
I guess I should actually put him to work then.

2266
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:10,330
We'll just put him right there.

2267
01:45:13,290 --> 01:45:14,130
Dear Christ!

2268
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:15,550
Look at the membership, thank you!

2269
01:45:16,930 --> 01:45:24,230
We were going to get lunch and I bet on one superchat that the people behind us would go to Curry Hyuga and then they didn't.

2270
01:45:24,570 --> 01:45:28,450
I had that one day at the convention.

2271
01:45:28,710 --> 01:45:29,670
It was pick up.

2272
01:45:30,190 --> 01:45:31,270
Someone picked it up.

2273
01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:33,610
I think someone from staff picked it up for me.

2274
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:40,150
So what did you have to do?

2275
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:41,610
You lost the bet?

2276
01:45:43,690 --> 01:45:45,470
What do you do now?

2277
01:45:46,450 --> 01:45:47,950
It was pretty good.

2278
01:45:48,190 --> 01:45:49,910
I actually didn't get to finish it though.

2279
01:45:54,430 --> 01:45:56,730
Basically, I took it back to my room.

2280
01:45:58,430 --> 01:46:03,670
I took it back to my room because we got it while we were signing the postcards for the Patreon.

2281
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:06,590
And I forgot a spoon.

2282
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:12,730
And I just never went back for a spoon.

2283
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:13,770
So...

2284
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:17,210
You know, it's kind of hard to eat curry without a spoon.

2285
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:19,730
Oh, I had to give you money.

2286
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:23,650
Yippee!

2287
01:46:32,980 --> 01:46:33,880
Appreciate it.

2288
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:39,020
0-2-5 is probably the best route.

2289
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:39,700
Oh, is it?

2290
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:40,080
Okay.

2291
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:46,120
Well, we're still early gathering, you know, so...

2292
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,440
I lost a bet once.

2293
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:49,980
My name was never the same.

2294
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:54,160
Yeah, your name changes all the time.

2295
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:56,120
Well,

2296
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:00,900
don't eat curry with a fork.

2297
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,080
What do you eat?

2298
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:02,300
Sure.

2299
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:04,440
Well...

2300
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,260
No, not typically.

2301
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:07,840
I usually use it with a spoon.

2302
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:08,940
But I didn't have anything.

2303
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:10,480
I didn't even have chopsticks.

2304
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:11,420
I didn't have a fork.

2305
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:12,140
I didn't have a spoon.

2306
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:13,440
I had my hands.

2307
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:16,560
And that's a little...

2308
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:20,300
Like, that was a little...

2309
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:23,360
I don't think... That was a little...

2310
01:47:25,700 --> 01:47:30,620
New fan who got interested in you thanks to all the cool Off-Kai merch and cosplay.

2311
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:31,480
No way!

2312
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:35,680
Saw your what order you should play MGS Short.

2313
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:37,900
And I have to say, I started with MGS...

2314
01:47:37,900 --> 01:47:39,340
The Phantom Pain!

2315
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:41,400
Oh!

2316
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:42,640
Yeah!

2317
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:45,720
I guess I'll just pass away.

2318
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:47,500
I'll pass away again, I suppose.

2319
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,060
Welcome back, Mii!

2320
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:51,680
Thank you!

2321
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:55,880
And there's a pocket utensil for Maria.

2322
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:56,820
Oh, you're so right.

2323
01:47:57,620 --> 01:48:00,400
Because that also kept happening at the hotel in Japan.

2324
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:08,360
Basically, we had a 7-Eleven by our hotel.

2325
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:12,420
And it was like... I would ask them to heat stuff up for me.

2326
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,160
And they're like, no, it's self-serve.

2327
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,700
So I was like...

2328
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:20,520
And so I would be like, oh, well, I'll just use the microwave...

2329
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,920
Wait, I was like, I'll just use the microwave at the hotel.

2330
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:34,060
But then I would forget because the forks and the chopsticks and all that fun stuff was all next to the microwave at the 7-Eleven.

2331
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,000
So I would forget it.

2332
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
I maybe should get an actual, like...

2333
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:43,560
Travel spoon set.

2334
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,920
Wait, they wouldn't eat your food?

2335
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,120
No!

2336
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:52,220
They told me to go use the self-serve... thing.

2337
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,180
Burny stuff.

2338
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,320
Woah, they're all on fire!

2339
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:00,320
Nice.

2340
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:03,720
Yeah, it's actually so messed up.

2341
01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:11,690
Pockety utensil.

2342
01:49:13,370 --> 01:49:14,410
Are you okay?

2343
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:16,390
I've never been okay.

2344
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:26,670
It was so sad for me.

2345
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:27,810
You guys don't understand.

2346
01:49:35,810 --> 01:49:38,670
Started my Metal Gear journey with the NES port of the first game.

2347
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:42,390
Bounced off of it because I was a silly kid who thought it'd be like Contra.

2348
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:48,350
Understandable, though, I guess.

2349
01:49:48,530 --> 01:49:49,430
I suppose, you know.

2350
01:49:49,970 --> 01:49:50,750
I get it.

2351
01:49:50,850 --> 01:49:50,990
Oh!

2352
01:49:51,770 --> 01:49:52,210
Moeb!

2353
01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:53,230
Moeb!

2354
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:54,330
Nice!

2355
01:49:54,330 --> 01:49:54,690
Nice!

2356
01:49:55,670 --> 01:49:56,270
Nice!

2357
01:49:56,970 --> 01:49:58,810
Gosh, we're so good at this game.

2358
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:03,930
I've been working on setting up what's called an uncapping tube.

2359
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:09,980
Save more wax...

2360
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:11,020
Oh my gosh, for candles.

2361
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:12,980
You and your candles.

2362
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:25,140
So that's why Makise Kurisu wanted her own party.

2363
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:28,200
I started with survive.

2364
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:28,820
Base.

2365
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:31,480
Ha ha ha.

2366
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:32,520
Based.

2367
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:36,940
Everybody knows you should start with Metal Gear Survive.

2368
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:38,320
I'm gonna put Gatlin...

2369
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:40,120
um...

2370
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:41,060
Gunner...

2371
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:47,840
We're gonna put him down here and we're gonna do our ray of doom.

2372
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:51,700
Like so.

2373
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:52,980
There we go.

2374
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:57,220
Looing...

2375
01:50:58,740 --> 01:51:01,560
What do you think of people whose first Metal Gear solo was acid?

2376
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:06,360
I don't really have an opinion, I'd say.

2377
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,220
I think that's an interesting choice.

2378
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:15,280
I think mostly, the reason why... I understand why so many people have started with 5.

2379
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:28,140
The reason why I'm just like, don't do it.

2380
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:29,760
Don't start with 5.

2381
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:32,980
Is because you just don't understand what's going on, you know?

2382
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:34,740
You're going to be so confused.

2383
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:36,880
Okay, good.

2384
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:40,280
Now we can use... I'll just do this.

2385
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,840
We'll just get night vision for all of them.

2386
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:45,500
The NVGs.

2387
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:48,240
I'll start with 2.

2388
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:49,920
See, even that's so confusing.

2389
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:02,880
It kind of reminds me of how I started... My first Final Fantasy was Final Fantasy X-2.

2390
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:07,060
Not Final Fantasy X.

2391
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:07,880
Oh no.

2392
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:10,400
No, I had to go in with the X-2.

2393
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:11,080
And guess what?

2394
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:12,400
I was so confused.

2395
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,280
You'll be confused no matter where you start.

2396
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:19,040
I suppose that's kind of true too, though.

2397
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:22,060
You're not completely wrong there.

2398
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:30,380
Why don't they juggle at the same time?

2399
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:33,160
These stupid...

2400
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:37,360
Stupid monkeys.

2401
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:40,960
What can I do for you?

2402
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:45,600
The idle one.

2403
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:47,420
Yeah, I kind of loved it though.

2404
01:52:47,940 --> 01:52:50,120
It's what my friend gifted me for my birthday.

2405
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:51,200
So I was like...

2406
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:54,060
Yeah, I'm going to play that one.

2407
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:56,660
So...

2408
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:01,960
But I...

2409
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:04,120
Did you at least play X after that?

2410
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:06,020
Eventually.

2411
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:13,840
Would you be surprised if I told you a lot of people start with Revengeance and end up very confused?

2412
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:17,920
See, even though I started with Revengeance, I wouldn't say that I was super confused.

2413
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:19,960
Wait, what does this do?

2414
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:22,320
Oh, it drops a crate full of cats.

2415
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:22,960
Oh, there it is.

2416
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:28,300
I wouldn't say... I mean, I was confused, but I was like...

2417
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:32,790
I...

2418
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:42,470
I think Revengeance, as a starting point, is less confusing than starting at 5.

2419
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:48,170
I also started Metal Gear as a kid with the NES game.

2420
01:53:48,610 --> 01:53:49,550
Not the NES.

2421
01:53:50,530 --> 01:53:55,130
I have fond memories of playing Pretend with my brother and our next-door friends.

2422
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:57,190
We'd sneak around and our house is like Snake.

2423
01:53:58,170 --> 01:53:59,330
Aw, you were normal.

2424
01:54:00,190 --> 01:54:02,550
I played Pretend as Blue Eyes White Dragon.

2425
01:54:06,610 --> 01:54:10,350
I was like, yeah, I'm Blue Eyes White Dragon.

2426
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:11,530
I'm just a dragon.

2427
01:54:12,930 --> 01:54:14,530
Why couldn't I play Pretend?

2428
01:54:14,530 --> 01:54:17,030
Why didn't I pretend to be Yu-Gi-Oh?

2429
01:54:17,730 --> 01:54:19,830
Why didn't I pretend to be like a human character?

2430
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:20,550
I have no idea.

2431
01:54:20,710 --> 01:54:22,410
Instead, I was like, I'm Blue Eyes White Dragon.

2432
01:54:30,020 --> 01:54:31,660
It's better that way.

2433
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:37,000
And then sometimes we would be the Harpy sisters or something like that.

2434
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:37,700
Me and my friends.

2435
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:46,920
I was going through my little brain.

2436
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:58,700
Look, our little murder monkey is getting good.

2437
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:01,800
He's getting all this XP.

2438
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:04,440
Oh, it shatters the things!

2439
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:05,780
Nice.

2440
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:09,060
And then... I can't get this one.

2441
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:09,980
Even faster reload.

2442
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:11,200
Okay, we can almost get it though.

2443
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:14,600
Maybe now?

2444
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:16,520
No.

2445
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:23,920
But several people gifted a... There was like a Yu-Gi-Oh...

2446
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:26,280
What's the word?

2447
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:33,520
A Yu-Gi-Oh Sanrio collab with McDonald's.

2448
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:37,960
That is like the... Okay, that is... Now that I think about it, that is like so convoluted.

2449
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:41,040
But some people gifted me at Off-Kai.

2450
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,740
They gifted me the Cinnamoroll Blue Eyes White Dragon.

2451
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:47,980
Which is just the most absolute perfect thing for me ever in the world.

2452
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:50,580
But you guys, I feel like Kaushi Henning recently.

2453
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:59,980
Have you guys seen the Hanamaru Obake Sanrio character?

2454
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:04,340
Recently, I've been really obsessed with him.

2455
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:07,440
We need a game where you play as Senator Armstrong.

2456
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:08,740
What do you do?

2457
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:10,420
You sign bills?

2458
01:56:10,420 --> 01:56:13,120
It's actually like a senator simulator.

2459
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:19,060
Yu-Gi-Oh Sanrio McDonald's.

2460
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:20,680
Yeah, it's all three together.

2461
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:24,240
It's just... It feels a little much, right?

2462
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,040
Maybe.

2463
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:31,640
Yippee!

2464
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:32,480
Free play.

2465
01:56:40,310 --> 01:56:44,550
Destined to be a Dragon VTuber fighting fate to be a ghost maid instead.

2466
01:56:46,870 --> 01:56:51,130
I've thought about, like, if I were to, you know...

2467
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:54,810
If I were...

2468
01:56:55,610 --> 01:56:56,710
How do I say?

2469
01:56:57,930 --> 01:57:01,090
Able to change my image, you know, because...

2470
01:57:01,090 --> 01:57:02,010
I mean...

2471
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:05,950
I... I was dead...

2472
01:57:07,010 --> 01:57:08,330
Several years ago.

2473
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:10,690
Um...

2474
01:57:11,710 --> 01:57:12,310
Two!

2475
01:57:12,890 --> 01:57:15,670
But I don't think there would be much that I would change...

2476
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:17,090
If I had the option to.

2477
01:57:20,270 --> 01:57:20,710
Wait.

2478
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:27,210
Oh my goodness!

2479
01:57:27,350 --> 01:57:29,090
All the Donuts are so backed up!

2480
01:57:29,770 --> 01:57:30,650
Glad you're back!

2481
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:31,310
Thanks Joshua!

2482
01:57:34,090 --> 01:57:37,150
Want to help me select the next movie I watch based on the title again.

2483
01:57:39,250 --> 01:57:41,710
Wait, isn't Steam...

2484
01:57:41,710 --> 01:57:43,010
Steam Boy is an anime, isn't it?

2485
01:57:43,590 --> 01:57:44,850
Dual Blood Rain.

2486
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:45,210
No.

2487
01:57:46,110 --> 01:57:46,550
Hahaha.

2488
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:50,750
Become a dragon.

2489
01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:53,330
I don't think I would want to be a dragon.

2490
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:55,530
I don't think so.

2491
01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:02,670
I think there's a lot of Dragon VTubers.

2492
01:58:02,930 --> 01:58:05,370
But now there's also, like, a lot of Ghost VTubers.

2493
01:58:07,110 --> 01:58:07,990
When I...

2494
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:11,710
When I first came around, there weren't so many, I think.

2495
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:13,610
But now there's so many, I feel.

2496
01:58:13,770 --> 01:58:14,650
So many...

2497
01:58:17,050 --> 01:58:17,930
So many...

2498
01:58:17,930 --> 01:58:21,610
Actually, I should probably put in a...

2499
01:58:21,610 --> 01:58:22,410
This guy.

2500
01:58:22,670 --> 01:58:24,730
So he slows him down, right?

2501
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:32,680
And then when this guy booms him up...

2502
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:37,740
There are a lot of VTubers.

2503
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:39,640
Yeah, I guess that's true too.

2504
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:43,020
There definitely are a lot of VTubers.

2505
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:48,700
Everybody rebrands to dragons.

2506
01:58:48,860 --> 01:58:49,240
Hi Hana!

2507
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:55,560
I think dragons are just cool.

2508
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:58,240
So I understand, you know, if people...

2509
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:59,000
You know...

2510
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:02,040
If somebody wants to be a dragon.

2511
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:07,390
And maids.

2512
01:59:07,610 --> 01:59:07,830
Yeah!

2513
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:10,070
There's a lot of maids now too.

2514
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:12,830
But maids are...

2515
01:59:12,830 --> 01:59:14,990
You know, maids are a staple, so...

2516
01:59:17,950 --> 01:59:18,510
That...

2517
01:59:19,550 --> 01:59:21,390
That I can't be upset about.

2518
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:28,440
They all died.

2519
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:29,320
I'm dead.

2520
01:59:29,660 --> 01:59:30,160
Too.

2521
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:35,340
But, you know.

2522
01:59:35,940 --> 01:59:37,560
I guess it is what it is.

2523
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:41,960
It is...

2524
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:43,200
What it is.

2525
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:44,640
A snake.

2526
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:49,140
I've seen like Lami VTubers before.

2527
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:49,720
It's so cool.

2528
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:54,140
Pshom!

2529
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:57,980
I wanna get to the Ray of Doom, but it's so expensive.

2530
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:01,700
What else can we...

2531
02:00:01,700 --> 02:00:03,340
Let's aim for...

2532
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:04,040
This...

2533
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:04,920
This one next.

2534
02:00:06,660 --> 02:00:08,240
Oh, let's get some more money too.

2535
02:00:11,020 --> 02:00:11,420
Money!

2536
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:11,720
Money!

2537
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:27,360
Lami!

2538
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:29,440
There we go.

2539
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:33,200
So now it's making its own...

2540
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:33,680
Now I don't...

2541
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:35,560
Yeah, it's just generating its own cash, right?

2542
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:35,880
Yeah.

2543
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:36,140
Okay.

2544
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:41,400
Let's go.

2545
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:41,620
Okay!

2546
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:42,480
Come here.

2547
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:44,500
Let's something that I think sweet.

2548
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:44,820
Yeah.

2549
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:49,780
Psh!

2550
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:51,740
Oh!

2551
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:52,000
So cool!

2552
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:52,580
I don't...

2553
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:56,680
Man...!

2554
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:57,360
Let's go down there.

2555
02:00:58,440 --> 02:00:58,960
Okay.

2556
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:01,100
Oh, in 30 seconds.

2557
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:02,240
Is this really cool or not?

2558
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:03,740
No, this is a good game.

2559
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:03,840
It's so cool.

2560
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:04,100
I learned something new...

2561
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:07,540
And that was the end of it.

2562
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:08,440
So...

2563
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:17,500
A pirate warlord.

2564
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:18,240
Oh, that sounds fun.

2565
02:01:21,780 --> 02:01:22,360
A bear.

2566
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,180
There's plenty of bears, I think.

2567
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:25,980
A detective.

2568
02:01:27,620 --> 02:01:29,940
And I'm not asking this to get ideas or anything.

2569
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:30,820
Don't get me wrong.

2570
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:37,220
I'm not gonna be like, So my next outfit should be a bear.

2571
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:39,500
A witch with a big hat.

2572
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:42,720
There's always more necessity for big hats.

2573
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:59,780
I'm gonna put in a... wait.

2574
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,660
Oh, we're so close!

2575
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:05,220
How do I get the money from here?

2576
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:06,700
It just generates on its own, I guess.

2577
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:10,280
There we go.

2578
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:14,000
Kaiju VTuber.

2579
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:19,060
My model is a sea angel.

2580
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:25,100
Like a blonde fairy.

2581
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:26,920
You have bad taste.

2582
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:29,780
An alien.

2583
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:31,320
I've seen those before.

2584
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,480
What if it became an F-4 Phantom?

2585
02:02:44,110 --> 02:02:47,200
I bet you can't name 100 VTubers.

2586
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:47,260
I bet you can't name 100 VTubers.

2587
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:54,940
VTuber 1, VTuber 2, VTuber 3, VTuber 4, VTuber 5, VTuber 6, VTuber 7, VTuber 8, VTuber 9, VTuber 10.

2588
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:56,160
100.

2589
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:08,680
Hydra VTuber with different personalities for each head.

2590
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:10,320
That would be insane.

2591
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:12,580
That sounds so fun.

2592
02:03:13,900 --> 02:03:14,380
Actually.

2593
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:18,340
I guess that's what's so great about VTubers.

2594
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:20,180
You can have so much...

2595
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:27,640
So many different kinds of creatures and critters and everything.

2596
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:30,160
A scuba diver.

2597
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:33,520
Do you want them to do actual scuba diving?

2598
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:37,600
Actual scuba diving streams?

2599
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:39,660
That would be awesome.

2600
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:43,220
I would love to do a scuba diving stream.

2601
02:03:51,450 --> 02:03:52,390
Thank you.

2602
02:03:53,490 --> 02:03:54,650
Thank you money.

2603
02:03:56,350 --> 02:03:56,750
Let's see.

2604
02:03:57,230 --> 02:03:58,170
Oh my gosh.

2605
02:03:58,190 --> 02:03:59,470
I was about to click on Ice Monkey.

2606
02:04:03,410 --> 02:04:04,210
32, 14.

2607
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:05,430
Okay, we can almost...

2608
02:04:05,430 --> 02:04:06,410
Maybe soon.

2609
02:04:10,070 --> 02:04:10,710
Maybe soon.

2610
02:04:14,450 --> 02:04:15,070
There we go.

2611
02:04:16,390 --> 02:04:16,790
Nice.

2612
02:04:19,050 --> 02:04:20,570
Curling you with a ghost tractor.

2613
02:04:21,330 --> 02:04:22,210
You can try.

2614
02:04:22,410 --> 02:04:22,950
You can try.

2615
02:04:22,950 --> 02:04:24,770
Why are you guys always trying to destroy me, huh?

2616
02:04:25,490 --> 02:04:27,750
I say some stuff sometimes and you guys will not.

2617
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:27,890
You can try.

2618
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:27,890
You can try.

2619
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:27,890
Why are you guys always trying to destroy me, huh?

2620
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:29,010
I can't get my hands on you.

2621
02:04:29,050 --> 02:04:29,770
What's wrong with you?

2622
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:35,780
Date the Diver VTuber.

2623
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:37,980
Metal Slime VTuber.

2624
02:04:38,980 --> 02:04:40,720
I diagnose you with goofy.

2625
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:42,960
Thanks for the pink cubic!

2626
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:49,140
I'd be a living rocket with a look like classic animation.

2627
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:52,020
Butch Hartman, hips for sure.

2628
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:56,260
Butch Hartman is the guy that does the art for Fairly Oddparents, right?

2629
02:04:56,540 --> 02:04:57,700
Does he have hips?

2630
02:05:00,620 --> 02:05:02,140
Like... does he have hips?

2631
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:06,500
Jar VTuber.

2632
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:07,660
What's wrong with you?

2633
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:09,220
Stop it!

2634
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:15,910
Kamen Rider.

2635
02:05:16,090 --> 02:05:17,290
Yeah, someone said Tokusatsu earlier.

2636
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:24,450
I find it hard to believe that there's... I mean, there's definitely a Tokusatsu VTuber out there.

2637
02:05:29,110 --> 02:05:31,630
I actually feel like I could name 100 VTubers.

2638
02:05:34,010 --> 02:05:35,790
That sounds like very easy, actually.

2639
02:05:36,850 --> 02:05:37,610
Naming 100.

2640
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:45,160
He makes women with hips.

2641
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:46,180
Wow.

2642
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:50,340
Fight me!

2643
02:05:52,360 --> 02:05:53,320
Voice crack!

2644
02:06:00,610 --> 02:06:01,550
Do it then.

2645
02:06:02,690 --> 02:06:04,990
If you can name Hololive, it's like 70 already.

2646
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:05,930
That's what I'm saying!

2647
02:06:06,130 --> 02:06:07,170
I feel like 100 is...

2648
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:08,690
Like, people are just like, do it then!

2649
02:06:09,110 --> 02:06:10,270
Bet you can't.

2650
02:06:10,270 --> 02:06:11,270
But it's actually like...

2651
02:06:12,050 --> 02:06:14,770
100 doesn't... 100 is not even that much, right?

2652
02:06:15,310 --> 02:06:17,210
You might need more monkeys.

2653
02:06:21,650 --> 02:06:23,050
I need a vacation.

2654
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:29,270
I'm gonna put in Super Monkey.

2655
02:06:29,770 --> 02:06:30,450
No.

2656
02:06:31,110 --> 02:06:32,050
Just kidding.

2657
02:06:32,330 --> 02:06:34,170
I'm gonna put in...

2658
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:40,100
Hmm.

2659
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,140
Name a monkey!

2660
02:06:44,740 --> 02:06:46,100
Name a monkey!

2661
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:47,720
Name a monkey!

2662
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:49,200
Name a monkey!

2663
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:50,040
We need more ice monkeys.

2664
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:51,700
Name a monkey!

2665
02:06:56,780 --> 02:06:57,720
More monkeys!

2666
02:06:57,800 --> 02:06:58,600
You have all of chat!

2667
02:06:59,540 --> 02:07:00,100
Wow.

2668
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:02,720
Why is my drum set so wet?

2669
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,600
This angel is a type of deep sea slug.

2670
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:06,900
They're cute.

2671
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:07,340
Oh!

2672
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:07,680
Cute!

2673
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:17,380
I need another ice... 0-0-0 ice monkey in the... near the table.

2674
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:17,960
Oh!

2675
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:18,940
The Butler monkey!

2676
02:07:19,980 --> 02:07:21,280
Butler ice monkey.

2677
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:21,660
He's...

2678
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:25,460
Actually, this is ice monkey over here.

2679
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:26,420
Who catches...

2680
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:29,440
This is Ice Monkey catching his ice monkey.

2681
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:31,600
Cheating on him.

2682
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:33,920
Oh my god...

2683
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:38,100
This is the ice monkey who's just like, OMG!

2684
02:07:38,220 --> 02:07:39,860
That's my lover over there!

2685
02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:42,160
We are in that seat, holding hands with that other ice monkey.

2686
02:07:42,420 --> 02:07:43,540
Oh my god!

2687
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:45,020
Oh my god!

2688
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:46,820
Oh my god, scandalous.

2689
02:07:50,610 --> 02:07:51,310
Drama!

2690
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:53,810
Absolute drama.

2691
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:55,890
Let's put...

2692
02:07:58,530 --> 02:07:59,930
Air carrier.

2693
02:08:00,530 --> 02:08:01,330
Aircraft carrier.

2694
02:08:01,830 --> 02:08:02,530
Monkey.

2695
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:07,010
Deploy the mini-planes!

2696
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:15,900
Super Monkey is a hero.

2697
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:21,200
Are you a hero?

2698
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:22,160
Were you... Have you been...

2699
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:23,960
Have you been a hero recently?

2700
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:26,120
When's the last time you were a hero?

2701
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:28,240
I offered a seat to an old lady.

2702
02:08:28,700 --> 02:08:29,380
I'm a hero.

2703
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:33,740
I didn't expect money out of it either.

2704
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:35,000
Though it would have been nice.

2705
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:38,200
It would have been cool if she had been like Here's ten thou... Not ten thousand.

2706
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:39,100
Here's a thousand yen.

2707
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:42,060
That would have been so grand.

2708
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:46,400
Oh my god, she's so crazy.

2709
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:51,440
Sometimes they do that though.

2710
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:51,980
Sometimes...

2711
02:08:51,980 --> 02:09:01,320
I was told once before that sometimes if you offer a seat to a grandma on a train, sometimes they'll give you money.

2712
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:10,020
And ever since then, I've never expected it, but I'm kind of just like What if it happens to me one day?

2713
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:13,460
I mean...

2714
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,540
What if it happens to me one day?

2715
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:17,100
What if it happens to me one day?

2716
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:21,040
I'm just saying.

2717
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:27,240
Yippee!

2718
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:31,960
Are you Himmel?

2719
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:41,420
Himmel the hero would never hold the seat expecting for a thousand yen, but would be grateful if he got the thousand yen.

2720
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:44,680
Nice of you to offer a seat to Batara.

2721
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:48,360
It was so funny.

2722
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:54,420
When I was on the plane back, I was just like I was like, I didn't get the... I didn't get the...

2723
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,340
the rest of the clothes that I wanted to get.

2724
02:09:57,660 --> 02:10:00,700
And so I was like frantically trying to order them.

2725
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:05,040
On the flight as it was taking off.

2726
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:08,700
Look at this!

2727
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:10,100
He covers the entire map!

2728
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:11,160
He's so awesome!

2729
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:14,180
What a great What a great passive.

2730
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:16,760
So good.

2731
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:17,920
Wait.

2732
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:19,540
What can you upgrade?

2733
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:24,160
Carrier flagship!

2734
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:26,800
Okay.

2735
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:27,600
That's not so bad.

2736
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:28,580
We can upgrade that soon.

2737
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:38,720
Prepaying a forward for that hero who gives up his seat for Mint Bachan.

2738
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:43,700
There was a time when Mintar...

2739
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:48,900
When Mintara and I I just literally said Mintara.

2740
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:49,520
So funny.

2741
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:50,100
Oh!

2742
02:10:50,220 --> 02:10:50,940
Those were DDTs?

2743
02:10:56,100 --> 02:10:58,920
When she and I were sitting and...

2744
02:10:59,980 --> 02:11:04,300
But we were separated and then somebody gave up their seat so we could sit next to each other.

2745
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:05,860
But that's like different, right?

2746
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:08,100
They didn't think... Oh my god!

2747
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:09,740
He covers the entire thing!

2748
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:11,520
That's so crazy!

2749
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:14,480
That's like different though.

2750
02:11:14,700 --> 02:11:16,300
Oh, I should probably start.

2751
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:19,780
Let's also get this bottom pathway.

2752
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:22,360
Twin guns.

2753
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:24,440
Long distance.

2754
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:25,620
Okay.

2755
02:11:29,430 --> 02:11:30,190
Mintara.

2756
02:11:31,690 --> 02:11:33,790
It's because of the Mintara Mondays.

2757
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:39,080
Oh!

2758
02:11:39,180 --> 02:11:40,300
I got rid of it.

2759
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:43,160
Age of the Carrier.

2760
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:46,300
Carrier flagship.

2761
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:49,780
Oh!

2762
02:11:49,780 --> 02:11:50,680
This is round 93!

2763
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:51,380
Oh my gosh!

2764
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:52,220
Wow!

2765
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:54,260
We went through 93 so easy!

2766
02:11:55,460 --> 02:11:57,280
We might actually get past 100.

2767
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:58,680
Nice!

2768
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:02,180
Nice!

2769
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:02,520
Nice!

2770
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:02,780
Nice!

2771
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:04,020
Nice!

2772
02:12:04,020 --> 02:12:05,860
Oh, we shall see.

2773
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:09,680
Trying to get...

2774
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:10,120
Um...

2775
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:10,780
Let's see.

2776
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:13,620
Maybe I'll...

2777
02:12:13,620 --> 02:12:15,000
Maybe I'll get this guy too.

2778
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,160
Yeah, let's do it.

2779
02:12:29,980 --> 02:12:31,760
Dun dun dun!

2780
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:33,340
Dun dun!

2781
02:12:34,460 --> 02:12:35,140
Hey!

2782
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:36,260
Hey!

2783
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:39,700
How's it go...

2784
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:50,760
Oh!

2785
02:12:59,930 --> 02:13:01,290
How much...

2786
02:13:01,290 --> 02:13:04,070
We have like no experience on this guy.

2787
02:13:04,230 --> 02:13:04,770
That's okay though.

2788
02:13:07,070 --> 02:13:08,770
Seeing a huge lack of farming.

2789
02:13:09,110 --> 02:13:10,050
Chill out!

2790
02:13:10,330 --> 02:13:11,070
We're getting there!

2791
02:13:12,670 --> 02:13:13,250
Gosh!

2792
02:13:15,030 --> 02:13:15,610
Gosh!

2793
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:20,690
Wasn't this one really expensive?

2794
02:13:21,070 --> 02:13:21,510
Yeah...

2795
02:13:22,170 --> 02:13:22,750
Maybe...

2796
02:13:25,170 --> 02:13:25,750
Hmm...

2797
02:13:25,750 --> 02:13:27,910
I'm trying to save up for this one.

2798
02:13:27,950 --> 02:13:28,970
Maybe we should just...

2799
02:13:40,430 --> 02:13:41,010
Moeb!

2800
02:13:43,810 --> 02:13:44,390
Moeb!

2801
02:13:44,390 --> 02:13:44,490
Let's die!

2802
02:13:45,310 --> 02:13:45,790
Drop!

2803
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:52,240
Little late for farming now.

2804
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:53,260
What are you talking about?

2805
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:54,220
It's never too late!

2806
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:56,080
It's only round 96!

2807
02:13:56,440 --> 02:13:57,160
What are you talking about?

2808
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:58,180
We're going to...

2809
02:13:58,180 --> 02:14:00,640
We're gone, baby!

2810
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:02,560
We're going, going, gone, baby!

2811
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:04,940
Oh, I keep forgetting to upgrade this guy.

2812
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:06,940
My bad.

2813
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:13,620
Oh!

2814
02:14:13,700 --> 02:14:15,600
I don't even have time to click the thing.

2815
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:20,000
Your farming is at 43.5% efficiency.

2816
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:20,200
Your farming is at 43 .5 % efficiency.

2817
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:21,160
Your farming is at 43.5% efficiency.

2818
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:23,400
VTuber, why do you not farm?

2819
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:25,500
Because, um...

2820
02:14:26,540 --> 02:14:27,500
You know...

2821
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:29,100
I like doing things natural.

2822
02:14:30,220 --> 02:14:32,020
Oh, natural, baby!

2823
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:32,600
Oh, natural, baby!

2824
02:14:35,540 --> 02:14:35,860
Okay.

2825
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:37,740
I do...

2826
02:14:37,740 --> 02:14:40,940
Supply, drop, upgrade.

2827
02:14:41,460 --> 02:14:41,480
Supply, drop, upgrade.

2828
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:43,080
Supply, drop, upgrade.

2829
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:44,940
Oh!

2830
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:46,600
Oh, I didn't even need it!

2831
02:14:46,660 --> 02:14:48,300
Oh my gosh, I didn't even need her!

2832
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:00,690
99, baby!

2833
02:15:04,650 --> 02:15:06,430
I can't upgrade too much.

2834
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:11,990
I think we're good.

2835
02:15:12,290 --> 02:15:12,730
Wow!

2836
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:14,710
Oh, I thought... I said...

2837
02:15:17,190 --> 02:15:19,290
Oh, does this thing need to be close to her?

2838
02:15:19,410 --> 02:15:19,690
Uh-oh.

2839
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:21,310
Attack!

2840
02:15:21,610 --> 02:15:22,030
Attack!

2841
02:15:22,310 --> 02:15:22,490
Attack!

2842
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:27,160
Oh!

2843
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:29,700
Oh my god!

2844
02:15:34,420 --> 02:15:36,420
Are you aware of the carrier's abilities?

2845
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:37,780
No.

2846
02:15:38,360 --> 02:15:38,980
Let's see.

2847
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:41,680
Does extra damage can place other monkeys on the upper deck?

2848
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:44,740
Of the ship and increase attack speed of all...

2849
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:46,280
Wait a second!

2850
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:47,840
Oh my god!

2851
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:52,160
I can put little monkeys up here!

2852
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:54,260
That's wild!

2853
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,020
That's so crazy!

2854
02:15:57,020 --> 02:15:59,820
This map is so easy though.

2855
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:01,420
Because they loop so many times.

2856
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:06,380
What should we put up there?

2857
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:10,600
I'm gonna put a helicopter.

2858
02:16:12,820 --> 02:16:13,840
I'm gonna put...

2859
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:14,520
I should put...

2860
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:16,180
I feel like I should at least have...

2861
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:18,300
A helicopter out here though.

2862
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:19,160
Right?

2863
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:19,800
Like...

2864
02:16:22,580 --> 02:16:25,920
I can't believe as many times as I've used the helicopter...

2865
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:27,140
I don't have everything unlocked.

2866
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:32,100
Put ice monkeys on top.

2867
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:34,160
For decorative ice monkeys?

2868
02:16:41,060 --> 02:16:42,340
Oh, an alchemist.

2869
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:44,180
Okay, we'll put one decorative monkey...

2870
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,400
And one alchemist.

2871
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:48,740
Oh wait.

2872
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:49,960
Maybe I should have switched those.

2873
02:16:57,090 --> 02:16:57,810
Oh wait.

2874
02:16:58,310 --> 02:16:59,210
Does he...

2875
02:16:59,210 --> 02:17:01,030
Will he reach all three of these guys?

2876
02:17:02,190 --> 02:17:02,630
Hmm...

2877
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:09,430
How many monkeys do you think I can squish up here?

2878
02:17:18,550 --> 02:17:18,990
Hmm...

2879
02:17:21,070 --> 02:17:21,930
Apache is OP.

2880
02:17:22,790 --> 02:17:23,950
Yeah, I wanted...

2881
02:17:23,950 --> 02:17:24,510
I've been...

2882
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:26,450
I actually...

2883
02:17:26,450 --> 02:17:29,590
I didn't realize I could actually unlock it now.

2884
02:17:31,890 --> 02:17:32,810
So we'll...

2885
02:17:32,810 --> 02:17:33,370
Do that.

2886
02:17:34,650 --> 02:17:35,310
Okay, hold on.

2887
02:17:35,390 --> 02:17:35,970
Let me get my...

2888
02:17:35,970 --> 02:17:37,230
Let me get my helicopter, guys.

2889
02:17:37,510 --> 02:17:38,710
Let me get my helicopter first.

2890
02:17:42,250 --> 02:17:42,710
Okay.

2891
02:17:44,330 --> 02:17:44,790
Go.

2892
02:17:48,730 --> 02:17:49,490
That was it?

2893
02:17:49,830 --> 02:17:50,490
No way.

2894
02:17:50,690 --> 02:17:51,490
That was so short.

2895
02:17:54,710 --> 02:17:55,530
Wrong monkey.

2896
02:17:55,810 --> 02:17:56,710
What are you talking about?

2897
02:18:00,290 --> 02:18:01,090
Oh, the wizard.

2898
02:18:01,730 --> 02:18:02,590
Wait, no.

2899
02:18:03,510 --> 02:18:04,190
Alchemist monkey.

2900
02:18:04,770 --> 02:18:05,230
Alchemist monkey.

2901
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:07,470
Right here.

2902
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:14,000
Is that MM on the carrier or EE?

2903
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:16,600
Is that MM on the carrier or EE?

2904
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:17,320
That's EE!

2905
02:18:18,420 --> 02:18:19,020
That's EE!

2906
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:20,880
Simba!

2907
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:21,260
Simba!

2908
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:24,060
But wait.

2909
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:27,120
If I put alchemist monkey here, will he reach all three of them?

2910
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:30,180
Here, he'll only reach two of them, right?

2911
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:31,140
Wait, does he have...

2912
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:31,440
What's his...

2913
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:34,280
Larger...

2914
02:18:34,280 --> 02:18:34,980
Oh, larger area!

2915
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:36,900
It doesn't even matter where I put him.

2916
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:39,520
Maybe I should put him here or here then.

2917
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:42,360
Because he'll reach over here as well then.

2918
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:44,340
Okay, we're gonna put him on the bottom.

2919
02:18:49,220 --> 02:18:49,920
Like that.

2920
02:18:50,220 --> 02:18:51,160
Wait, what's his radius?

2921
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:51,760
Oh.

2922
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:54,520
What happened to the larger radius?

2923
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:55,660
You know what?

2924
02:18:55,680 --> 02:18:55,900
It's fine.

2925
02:19:06,450 --> 02:19:08,850
Who cares about the details, I guess?

2926
02:19:12,350 --> 02:19:13,930
Dang, I thought I would have enough money.

2927
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:18,580
Come on, guys!

2928
02:19:19,380 --> 02:19:19,920
Nice.

2929
02:19:21,800 --> 02:19:22,880
Nice, nice, nice.

2930
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:27,000
It was larger potion, not radius.

2931
02:19:32,140 --> 02:19:32,680
Um...

2932
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:33,260
Um...

2933
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:40,320
Will that acid pool do anything if I already have this on the ground?

2934
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:43,980
I'll just put a second one.

2935
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:45,540
It's fine, you guys.

2936
02:19:48,220 --> 02:19:48,820
There we go.

2937
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:50,480
They're buddies.

2938
02:19:51,620 --> 02:19:53,160
Screw the ice monkeys.

2939
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:54,540
We already have two of them over there.

2940
02:20:13,320 --> 02:20:14,040
Alchemist yaoi.

2941
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:14,920
You said it, not me.

2942
02:20:16,460 --> 02:20:17,540
You said it, not me.

2943
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:21,880
Those were your words.

2944
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:23,780
I chose to read them aloud.

2945
02:20:23,980 --> 02:20:25,600
But those were your words.

2946
02:20:33,510 --> 02:20:34,650
Just stop at fast throwing.

2947
02:20:36,470 --> 02:20:36,870
Yeah...

2948
02:20:38,070 --> 02:20:40,110
I think it would be better to throw faster, too.

2949
02:20:40,370 --> 02:20:41,450
Okay, we'll just stop it then.

2950
02:20:41,870 --> 02:20:43,750
We don't have to do all the upgrades, I suppose.

2951
02:20:45,710 --> 02:20:46,110
Um...

2952
02:20:47,030 --> 02:20:47,430
32...

2953
02:20:47,430 --> 02:20:48,350
Where was...

2954
02:20:48,350 --> 02:20:49,190
Oh, no.

2955
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:51,950
There was another one that I was gonna upgrade.

2956
02:20:52,710 --> 02:20:54,450
I know I need to do that one, too.

2957
02:20:56,070 --> 02:20:56,590
Huh...

2958
02:20:56,590 --> 02:20:57,270
Can't remember.

2959
02:20:59,430 --> 02:20:59,950
Hmm...

2960
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:00,530
Hello.

2961
02:21:09,870 --> 02:21:10,930
Myoshi's a gamer.

2962
02:21:13,510 --> 02:21:14,650
Yeah, basically.

2963
02:21:15,790 --> 02:21:17,970
These poor monkeys, it's like...

2964
02:21:17,970 --> 02:21:20,810
Look, this factory is literally cutting into his bed.

2965
02:21:22,550 --> 02:21:24,290
This kind of sucks for him.

2966
02:21:24,490 --> 02:21:25,490
So sorry for you.

2967
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:33,880
Let's get in Super Monkey, too.

2968
02:21:34,040 --> 02:21:34,200
Let's get in Super Monkey, too.

2969
02:21:35,300 --> 02:21:36,920
And we'll get him buffed as well.

2970
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:37,380
And we'll get him buffed as well.

2971
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:40,360
Which is the best route for the Super Monkey?

2972
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:40,640
Which is the best route for the Super Monkey?

2973
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:42,140
Because I started on both of these.

2974
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:46,680
I think I was going for the Sun one, and then I was like...

2975
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:46,960
I think I was going for the Sun one, and then I was like...

2976
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:48,620
I'm gonna go for a Robo Monkey.

2977
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:51,960
Good to see you back home again.

2978
02:21:52,020 --> 02:21:52,760
I hope you have a great stream.

2979
02:21:52,820 --> 02:21:53,320
Thank you!

2980
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:55,260
Thank you, thank you!

2981
02:21:58,760 --> 02:21:59,860
The gamer monkey.

2982
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:01,900
Oh, that was so fast.

2983
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:06,020
I think we'll do the Crippled Moab.

2984
02:22:08,580 --> 02:22:10,060
Oh wait, I was gonna go for this one.

2985
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:10,400
There it is.

2986
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:27,780
Welcome back, Minto.

2987
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:28,460
Thank you!

2988
02:22:31,700 --> 02:22:32,420
Thank you, thank you.

2989
02:22:32,420 --> 02:22:32,480
Thank you.

2990
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:37,000
Next round.

2991
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:37,820
107.

2992
02:22:58,040 --> 02:22:58,720
Money, money.

2993
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:01,600
Top of a Batman is fun.

2994
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:05,240
Power of the Sun is unstoppable.

2995
02:23:05,820 --> 02:23:07,120
Okay, then I'll save up for it.

2996
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:08,820
I'll save up for it.

2997
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:11,780
This one.

2998
02:23:13,220 --> 02:23:14,100
Holy moly!

2999
02:23:14,260 --> 02:23:15,040
Wait, how much is...

3000
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:17,420
Five hundred thousand!

3001
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:20,760
I think I need more trees.

3002
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:24,980
I think I need more trees.

3003
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:27,400
I think I'm slacking a little bit.

3004
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:31,420
I think I'm slacking a little bit.

3005
02:23:31,860 --> 02:23:33,100
I think I'm slacking a little bit.

3006
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:40,340
I just realized

3007
02:23:47,660 --> 02:23:48,800
I could taste my coffee.

3008
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:49,900
Yippee!

3009
02:23:49,900 --> 02:23:49,940
Whee!

3010
02:23:50,940 --> 02:23:54,040
It's weird the things that I can taste and the things I can't taste.

3011
02:23:54,940 --> 02:23:57,280
Because I can taste salt...

3012
02:23:59,280 --> 02:23:59,760
And...

3013
02:24:03,880 --> 02:24:05,800
I can taste...

3014
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:10,700
I can taste the grape jelly.

3015
02:24:10,740 --> 02:24:13,680
Maybe my taste is coming back more than I thought it would be.

3016
02:24:13,960 --> 02:24:15,300
More than I thought it has.

3017
02:24:16,500 --> 02:24:17,740
Your health is going up!

3018
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:19,600
Going up, baby!

3019
02:24:20,980 --> 02:24:22,060
No monkey village.

3020
02:24:22,060 --> 02:24:23,780
Where should I put it, though?

3021
02:24:23,820 --> 02:24:24,840
Where do I even need to put it?

3022
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:26,660
Oh my gosh, I forgot this ice monkey was here.

3023
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:27,260
Wait!

3024
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:29,140
This guy is killing bloons!

3025
02:24:31,560 --> 02:24:34,120
We can't have an ice monkey that is doing something.

3026
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:37,020
We have to have only useless ice monkeys.

3027
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:41,300
I first realized the location of that guy, he was killing things!

3028
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:42,440
He was helping out!

3029
02:24:46,750 --> 02:24:47,190
Degads.

3030
02:24:56,150 --> 02:24:56,590
Dang.

3031
02:24:57,290 --> 02:24:58,670
He pushes it back so well.

3032
02:24:58,830 --> 02:24:59,290
It's crazy.

3033
02:25:05,170 --> 02:25:06,290
Holy moly!

3034
02:25:08,030 --> 02:25:08,950
We have...

3035
02:25:08,950 --> 02:25:11,330
Have you guys seen how many lives?

3036
02:25:11,650 --> 02:25:15,710
We have 516 extra lives.

3037
02:25:15,910 --> 02:25:16,470
What?

3038
02:25:23,330 --> 02:25:27,750
Salt tastes as tongue versus a lot of what we normally taste in food is from the smell.

3039
02:25:27,990 --> 02:25:29,330
Well, I can actually smell.

3040
02:25:29,630 --> 02:25:30,190
I never...

3041
02:25:30,190 --> 02:25:33,450
I could actually at some point smell better than I could taste.

3042
02:25:36,050 --> 02:25:37,290
He was carrying.

3043
02:25:38,150 --> 02:25:39,410
We're gonna lose now.

3044
02:25:39,990 --> 02:25:41,050
We're gonna lose!

3045
02:25:46,930 --> 02:25:49,430
Okay, all my... these guys down here, max.

3046
02:25:50,290 --> 02:25:51,130
Very good.

3047
02:25:57,860 --> 02:25:59,420
514 extra lives.

3048
02:26:00,020 --> 02:26:01,280
How is that possible?

3049
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:03,960
He just wanted to help.

3050
02:26:04,220 --> 02:26:06,420
No, ice monkeys are not allowed to help.

3051
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:09,360
They're only allowed to be little cute goofy guys that juggle.

3052
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:10,680
Okay?

3053
02:26:10,980 --> 02:26:12,080
We'll have to understand.

3054
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:12,880
They're sensitive.

3055
02:26:23,850 --> 02:26:25,210
Maybe I should do...

3056
02:26:26,090 --> 02:26:27,590
Which would be the good one?

3057
02:26:28,990 --> 02:26:30,190
Epic range, maybe?

3058
02:26:30,350 --> 02:26:30,910
Simba!

3059
02:26:31,050 --> 02:26:31,790
Thank you for the...

3060
02:26:33,390 --> 02:26:33,950
Gifted!

3061
02:26:33,950 --> 02:26:34,790
Thank you so much!

3062
02:26:47,140 --> 02:26:48,380
Twin ice monkeys.

3063
02:26:52,260 --> 02:26:54,540
Ice monkey deserves to be pampered.

3064
02:26:55,020 --> 02:26:56,660
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

3065
02:26:58,460 --> 02:27:00,480
This is... I... I don't... I don't...

3066
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:02,360
I know people will say that this is...

3067
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:04,100
My... my map is not optimized.

3068
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:07,360
But this is peak monkey optimization right here, actually.

3069
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:10,180
This is what they don't want... don't tell you.

3070
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:15,040
Third ice monkey.

3071
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:33,400
Ice monkeys clap when they attack, though.

3072
02:27:33,620 --> 02:27:34,820
Aw, that's pretty cute.

3073
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:37,380
My YouTube is breaking.

3074
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:41,380
Dang.

3075
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:43,440
You know what?

3076
02:27:43,560 --> 02:27:44,000
Maybe...

3077
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:45,860
Hold on.

3078
02:27:46,280 --> 02:27:47,740
This is just long range.

3079
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:49,720
This is... you know what?

3080
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:51,820
Since I'm saving up, I'm just gonna go like this.

3081
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:56,240
The DDTs always freak me out.

3082
02:27:56,600 --> 02:28:00,720
I don't... actually, this might be my longest game I've ever done ever, you guys.

3083
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:05,120
This might be the longest I've ever gone in a game.

3084
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:06,660
I think.

3085
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:09,920
Do I sound congestion?

3086
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:12,120
Do him so...

3087
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:12,280
Yeah.

3088
02:28:12,420 --> 02:28:14,660
Oh, do a village right here so he can hit all types.

3089
02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:15,080
So true.

3090
02:28:15,220 --> 02:28:15,480
So true.

3091
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:19,160
In fact, I'm gonna do it right in between.

3092
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:22,300
It's even gonna get ice monkey.

3093
02:28:33,380 --> 02:28:34,220
There we go.

3094
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:36,300
Only a little bit.

3095
02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:38,160
That's good, I guess.

3096
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:41,540
Is it because I usually sound nasally?

3097
02:28:43,660 --> 02:28:46,660
Are you saying I usually sound nasally?

3098
02:28:47,700 --> 02:28:49,240
Fortified DDTs might be the end of you.

3099
02:28:49,380 --> 02:28:49,700
Hey.

3100
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:52,900
Shun the non-believers.

3101
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:02,620
I thought that was the end of me.

3102
02:29:05,380 --> 02:29:07,220
I thought that was the end of me.

3103
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:09,520
I need more experience.

3104
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:11,500
He earns heaps of money.

3105
02:29:11,640 --> 02:29:12,980
I need heaps of money.

3106
02:29:13,960 --> 02:29:14,800
I need it.

3107
02:29:20,570 --> 02:29:20,970
Oh.

3108
02:29:21,230 --> 02:29:21,630
Oh.

3109
02:29:21,970 --> 02:29:22,290
Oh.

3110
02:29:24,590 --> 02:29:25,250
Just kidding.

3111
02:29:36,610 --> 02:29:37,330
This is...

3112
02:29:37,330 --> 02:29:37,790
I'm a ghost.

3113
02:29:39,590 --> 02:29:40,810
This is not a spooky number.

3114
02:29:40,890 --> 02:29:41,990
This is the spookiest number.

3115
02:29:43,470 --> 02:29:44,370
Number of lives.

3116
02:29:48,830 --> 02:29:49,390
Oh, my God.

3117
02:29:49,410 --> 02:29:49,970
It's this thing again.

3118
02:29:50,170 --> 02:29:50,670
Oh my God.

3119
02:29:50,690 --> 02:29:51,210
There's two of them.

3120
02:29:51,690 --> 02:29:52,290
Wait a second.

3121
02:29:52,430 --> 02:29:52,790
Uh-oh.

3122
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:53,830
Am I in trouble?

3123
02:29:55,850 --> 02:29:56,690
Oh, there's three...

3124
02:29:56,690 --> 02:29:57,570
Oh, there's three of them!

3125
02:29:58,170 --> 02:29:58,990
Am I in trouble?

3126
02:30:02,250 --> 02:30:04,590
Am I in trouble?

3127
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:09,940
Maybe not.

3128
02:30:10,140 --> 02:30:10,620
Maybe I'm OK.

3129
02:30:21,700 --> 02:30:23,180
Get it off the screen.

3130
02:30:23,260 --> 02:30:23,700
It's haunted.

3131
02:30:24,020 --> 02:30:24,900
It's gone now.

3132
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:25,740
You're all safe.

3133
02:30:26,180 --> 02:30:27,640
The forbidden number.

3134
02:30:28,620 --> 02:30:30,080
You're all safe here.

3135
02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:31,260
I protected you.

3136
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:33,900
I'm your savior.

3137
02:30:36,700 --> 02:30:38,720
I wanna get to the 60,000.

3138
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:41,660
Or what else can we buy?

3139
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:44,960
Almost everything's maxed.

3140
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:45,340
It's crazy.

3141
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:48,660
What level is she at?

3142
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:49,540
She's maxed too?

3143
02:30:49,700 --> 02:30:50,140
Everybody's...

3144
02:30:50,140 --> 02:30:51,500
So many people are maxed.

3145
02:30:54,700 --> 02:30:57,640
We're gonna reach 60k in no time with this.

3146
02:30:59,000 --> 02:30:59,480
120!

3147
02:30:59,480 --> 02:31:00,660
Holy cow, you guys.

3148
02:31:00,700 --> 02:31:02,800
This might be the furthest I've ever gotten, ever.

3149
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:07,320
Looks like it's fanning my butt.

3150
02:31:09,740 --> 02:31:11,620
I think this is the furthest top!

3151
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:12,680
Look at the membership!

3152
02:31:19,220 --> 02:31:22,140
What else should I add to the playing field?

3153
02:31:25,100 --> 02:31:26,140
What's another monkey?

3154
02:31:26,220 --> 02:31:27,380
Everybody name a monkey.

3155
02:31:27,460 --> 02:31:28,060
Name a monkey.

3156
02:31:33,440 --> 02:31:37,020
I wish I could upgrade to the Sun Temple, but it says it sacrifices someone, right?

3157
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:41,040
What am I sacrificing?

3158
02:31:44,280 --> 02:31:44,740
Yippee!

3159
02:31:50,100 --> 02:31:50,840
So close.

3160
02:31:51,140 --> 02:31:52,140
For the Super Storm.

3161
02:31:52,560 --> 02:31:53,020
Oh!

3162
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:54,520
Super Storm!

3163
02:31:58,240 --> 02:31:59,500
I wanna see what happens.

3164
02:32:01,880 --> 02:32:02,680
What does it do?

3165
02:32:02,980 --> 02:32:05,320
Storm blasts all bloon types for massive damage.

3166
02:32:05,380 --> 02:32:06,460
Blows them away from the exit.

3167
02:32:07,160 --> 02:32:07,660
Let's go.

3168
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:10,060
Ice monkey!

3169
02:32:10,360 --> 02:32:11,280
Ninja monkey.

3170
02:32:12,260 --> 02:32:14,140
Could add a ninja monkey.

3171
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:15,100
Why not?

3172
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:17,840
Get a ninja monkey in there.

3173
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:18,860
Why not?

3174
02:32:25,640 --> 02:32:29,960
Guys, I didn't even, like, get past our... the front.

3175
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:31,980
Oh my gosh.

3176
02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:34,880
Upgrade!

3177
02:32:36,820 --> 02:32:37,420
Ice!

3178
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:44,180
I don't think I will.

3179
02:32:46,960 --> 02:32:48,000
I don't think I will.

3180
02:32:49,540 --> 02:32:50,760
I don't think I will, no.

3181
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,300
Plays more karaoke stuff like break stuff when you better.

3182
02:32:53,800 --> 02:32:54,240
Okay.

3183
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:57,200
Nah, I've said it before.

3184
02:32:59,500 --> 02:33:01,460
While I wouldn't mind...

3185
02:33:01,460 --> 02:33:05,380
I'm actually gonna put a gatling monkey on this end, too.

3186
02:33:06,320 --> 02:33:06,840
I'm actually gonna put a gatling monkey on this end, too.

3187
02:33:07,740 --> 02:33:10,900
And this guy will face... this way.

3188
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:12,980
Exactly like that.

3189
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:16,780
And then we'll go... we'll upgrade his laser.

3190
02:33:21,240 --> 02:33:23,440
And then eventually we can upgrade this guy.

3191
02:33:23,740 --> 02:33:24,980
But I don't think I will, anyway.

3192
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:30,680
Anna, are you the same person... wait, can someone check?

3193
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:34,540
Was Anna the ice monkey person before, too?

3194
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:40,420
Anna, are you... are you the same Anna of ice monkey fame?

3195
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:42,840
I wanna... actually, not fame.

3196
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:43,560
Infamy?

3197
02:33:57,050 --> 02:33:59,170
Why aren't you upgrading the monkey on the right?

3198
02:33:59,370 --> 02:34:00,830
Because we're gonna get to him.

3199
02:34:01,010 --> 02:34:02,490
We need 80,000.

3200
02:34:02,510 --> 02:34:05,730
I upgraded him first, and now we're gonna upgrade him.

3201
02:34:06,010 --> 02:34:07,270
Don't worry about it.

3202
02:34:08,730 --> 02:34:09,390
Hold on.

3203
02:34:09,490 --> 02:34:11,770
If YouTube wasn't so slow...

3204
02:34:12,410 --> 02:34:13,250
Oh my gosh.

3205
02:34:13,790 --> 02:34:14,470
Uh-oh.

3206
02:34:14,470 --> 02:34:15,810
Oh my gosh.

3207
02:34:16,750 --> 02:34:18,130
YouTube is so slow.

3208
02:34:18,370 --> 02:34:20,450
YouTube is the worst ever, please!

3209
02:34:20,690 --> 02:34:22,450
Hold on, I have to restart my YouTube.

3210
02:34:25,090 --> 02:34:26,590
Ba-bam, ba-dum, ba-dum.

3211
02:34:27,450 --> 02:34:35,480
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

3212
02:34:36,140 --> 02:34:36,620
Okay,

3213
02:34:41,530 --> 02:34:41,790
there we go.

3214
02:34:44,530 --> 02:34:46,650
YouTube RAM usage is really bad, for real.

3215
02:34:46,710 --> 02:34:47,530
I know, right?

3216
02:34:48,190 --> 02:34:48,670
Okay.

3217
02:34:48,670 --> 02:34:51,670
Okay, we're getting to 80,000 you guys and then we'll upgrade.

3218
02:34:52,370 --> 02:34:53,950
Don't worry, it's gonna happen.

3219
02:34:54,870 --> 02:34:56,550
I believe, I believe, I believe.

3220
02:34:57,470 --> 02:34:59,070
And then we can upgrade that one.

3221
02:35:01,370 --> 02:35:03,570
Can you downgrade IceMonkeyStreamer?

3222
02:35:05,230 --> 02:35:07,210
IceMonkey is already 0, 0, 0 everybody.

3223
02:35:09,650 --> 02:35:12,170
That is the most... it's the least I can do.

3224
02:35:14,390 --> 02:35:16,610
This game is no monkey business.

3225
02:35:16,610 --> 02:35:19,710
This game is actually only monkey business.

3226
02:35:19,890 --> 02:35:21,490
This game is all monkey business.

3227
02:35:21,670 --> 02:35:23,930
This game can't be anything but monkey business.

3228
02:35:24,210 --> 02:35:25,310
This game is a business.

3229
02:35:25,530 --> 02:35:27,250
I'm losing stock right now.

3230
02:35:28,330 --> 02:35:32,610
They said if you don't upgrade Lazer, my stocks are crashing.

3231
02:35:32,990 --> 02:35:35,990
The monkey market is going to be in shambles.

3232
02:35:36,510 --> 02:35:37,150
Please.

3233
02:35:37,450 --> 02:35:38,750
You don't understand.

3234
02:35:39,310 --> 02:35:42,070
The monkey market right now depends on it.

3235
02:35:45,270 --> 02:35:47,130
Sell him to downgrade.

3236
02:35:51,410 --> 02:35:53,050
I like how...

3237
02:35:53,050 --> 02:35:55,850
I was gonna say, Sato doesn't even talk anymore.

3238
02:35:57,230 --> 02:35:59,110
DDT, handle it.

3239
02:36:00,330 --> 02:36:01,610
I miss him.

3240
02:36:03,270 --> 02:36:04,810
The monkey recession.

3241
02:36:08,030 --> 02:36:09,490
Upgrade this maid.

3242
02:36:12,410 --> 02:36:14,110
Am I not already...

3243
02:36:15,430 --> 02:36:16,970
Am I not already peak?

3244
02:36:18,770 --> 02:36:20,370
She is not peak, your honor.

3245
02:36:21,030 --> 02:36:23,650
What if your next outfit was an ice monkey maid?

3246
02:36:24,930 --> 02:36:26,370
I think that's a waste of money.

3247
02:36:29,470 --> 02:36:31,410
That is a waste of my money.

3248
02:36:42,460 --> 02:36:43,800
Look how much he is doing.

3249
02:36:43,880 --> 02:36:45,140
He is blowing these guys back.

3250
02:36:45,620 --> 02:36:46,860
He is blowing them.

3251
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:47,860
He is blowing them hard.

3252
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:54,500
Sounds like an investment to me.

3253
02:36:56,200 --> 02:36:57,780
Would then I be peak?

3254
02:36:58,560 --> 02:37:01,000
Would then I be peak if I were ice monkey?

3255
02:37:01,620 --> 02:37:03,520
And then I could sit there and juggle?

3256
02:37:03,640 --> 02:37:04,600
That would be the whole stream.

3257
02:37:04,700 --> 02:37:07,760
I would just sit in a little lawn chair and I would juggle sometimes.

3258
02:37:08,860 --> 02:37:11,000
I wouldn't even juggle all the time.

3259
02:37:11,220 --> 02:37:12,440
I would only juggle sometimes.

3260
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:16,140
Holy moly.

3261
02:37:16,180 --> 02:37:18,160
These guys are fast.

3262
02:37:18,460 --> 02:37:18,740
Fast.

3263
02:37:18,940 --> 02:37:18,960
Fast.

3264
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:22,620
Okay, see we already have 50 out of 80.

3265
02:37:24,260 --> 02:37:25,360
52 out of 80.

3266
02:37:28,380 --> 02:37:29,020
I'm nervous.

3267
02:37:30,100 --> 02:37:30,540
Okay.

3268
02:37:30,820 --> 02:37:31,500
There we go.

3269
02:37:37,230 --> 02:37:38,910
It was just 11,000.

3270
02:37:38,910 --> 02:37:39,730
We could take the risk.

3271
02:37:41,690 --> 02:37:43,270
Maybe I should build another farm.

3272
02:37:45,150 --> 02:37:46,850
I wish I could upgrade these ones.

3273
02:37:53,500 --> 02:37:54,280
What's this one?

3274
02:37:55,320 --> 02:37:55,760
Whoa.

3275
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:03,720
I know I wasted money, but it was worth it, okay?

3276
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:10,140
What if you arrange that letter to spell out big M?

3277
02:38:12,220 --> 02:38:14,400
They hit absolutely nothing.

3278
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:15,380
They just go...

3279
02:38:21,060 --> 02:38:22,300
Never hitting 80...

3280
02:38:22,300 --> 02:38:23,220
Shush, shush, shush.

3281
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:24,000
We are hitting 80k.

3282
02:38:24,660 --> 02:38:25,760
We are hitting 80k.

3283
02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:26,580
Don't worry about it.

3284
02:38:27,980 --> 02:38:28,680
Don't worry about it.

3285
02:38:28,680 --> 02:38:29,020
Let's do it.

3286
02:38:33,400 --> 02:38:35,380
Monkey call the arms.

3287
02:38:36,440 --> 02:38:37,440
Monkey arms.

3288
02:38:40,220 --> 02:38:41,220
Monkey arms.

3289
02:38:42,060 --> 02:38:43,060
Monkey arms.

3290
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:44,820
What are those ice monkeys doing?

3291
02:38:44,860 --> 02:38:45,900
Yeah, they're just lounging.

3292
02:38:45,900 --> 02:38:46,440
They're hanging out.

3293
02:38:46,700 --> 02:38:47,960
And they're juggling sometimes.

3294
02:38:48,160 --> 02:38:48,320
Oh.

3295
02:38:48,880 --> 02:38:49,500
Hold on.

3296
02:38:49,540 --> 02:38:50,880
They'll definitely juggle next time.

3297
02:38:51,340 --> 02:38:52,080
Look at them go.

3298
02:38:52,780 --> 02:38:54,260
You have to be really fast though.

3299
02:38:57,680 --> 02:38:59,820
They scratch their butt a little bit.

3300
02:39:02,540 --> 02:39:04,160
They're peak monkey farm.

3301
02:39:06,100 --> 02:39:07,080
And you guys...

3302
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:08,940
These guys are lounging down here as well.

3303
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:11,540
Everybody, this is just the most relaxing game ever.

3304
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:15,040
Actually, I'm quite impressed at how far we've gotten.

3305
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:18,900
I'm actually super duper impressed right now.

3306
02:39:19,480 --> 02:39:20,680
I'm like, damn.

3307
02:39:22,060 --> 02:39:23,580
Maybe I'm good at this game.

3308
02:39:24,200 --> 02:39:24,860
You know?

3309
02:39:25,960 --> 02:39:27,740
I can upgrade this one though.

3310
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:28,260
You got...

3311
02:39:28,260 --> 02:39:28,360
No.

3312
02:39:28,440 --> 02:39:29,360
I'm gonna get to 80.

3313
02:39:35,550 --> 02:39:36,650
I'm gonna get to 80.

3314
02:39:43,500 --> 02:39:44,560
We're almost to 60.

3315
02:39:45,580 --> 02:39:46,720
What are we saving for?

3316
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:48,180
This guy right here.

3317
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:49,440
He's 80,000.

3318
02:39:49,660 --> 02:39:50,640
Ray of Doom.

3319
02:39:51,360 --> 02:39:52,180
He's expensive.

3320
02:39:54,860 --> 02:39:55,340
Damn.

3321
02:39:55,380 --> 02:39:55,960
She's good.

3322
02:39:57,480 --> 02:39:58,840
I thought of that.

3323
02:39:59,080 --> 02:40:00,220
I mean, do you guys know that?

3324
02:40:00,220 --> 02:40:06,000
Do you guys know that camp rock clip where the girl is just like...

3325
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,160
She's like doing things with her arms.

3326
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:10,100
She's like on the keyboard and it's like...

3327
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:13,120
And they're like, she's pretty good.

3328
02:40:15,960 --> 02:40:16,840
That's me right now.

3329
02:40:25,300 --> 02:40:26,420
These DDTs...

3330
02:40:27,800 --> 02:40:28,640
More like...

3331
02:40:30,120 --> 02:40:31,240
DD don'ts.

3332
02:40:37,420 --> 02:40:39,780
Why do people always spam at monkeys?

3333
02:40:43,220 --> 02:40:44,640
I'm not even reading it.

3334
02:40:44,780 --> 02:40:45,320
Too much...

3335
02:40:45,320 --> 02:40:46,040
Too mucho...

3336
02:40:46,040 --> 02:40:46,820
Mucho texto.

3337
02:40:47,500 --> 02:40:48,020
Sorry.

3338
02:40:48,920 --> 02:40:49,780
Mucho texto.

3339
02:40:55,210 --> 02:40:55,730
Anyway.

3340
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:05,380
Because it's fun seeing your reaction.

3341
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:08,320
I don't think so.

3342
02:41:08,400 --> 02:41:09,160
I don't think they do it.

3343
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:11,020
Well, maybe they do it for my reaction.

3344
02:41:11,540 --> 02:41:12,600
Maybe they're just like...

3345
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:13,840
The streamer noticed me.

3346
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:17,820
But I just...

3347
02:41:17,820 --> 02:41:18,560
Mucho texto.

3348
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:19,300
Do not read.

3349
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:23,260
I have my limits.

3350
02:41:24,400 --> 02:41:25,360
Oh, we're only...

3351
02:41:25,360 --> 02:41:26,020
Okay, never mind.

3352
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:27,360
I have my...

3353
02:41:27,360 --> 02:41:28,420
Even I have my limits.

3354
02:41:29,340 --> 02:41:31,140
Why are you not efficient, VTuber?

3355
02:41:34,840 --> 02:41:35,380
Efficiency?

3356
02:41:36,380 --> 02:41:38,700
Because I can't be peak and efficient.

3357
02:41:40,460 --> 02:41:41,000
Jaja!

3358
02:41:41,080 --> 02:41:41,420
Oh!

3359
02:41:44,980 --> 02:41:45,540
Wow!

3360
02:41:54,170 --> 02:41:54,730
Let's...

3361
02:41:56,050 --> 02:41:56,950
Unlock this.

3362
02:41:57,230 --> 02:41:58,050
And this.

3363
02:42:01,610 --> 02:42:02,170
Nice.

3364
02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:08,040
Holy moly!

3365
02:42:09,320 --> 02:42:09,880
Okay.

3366
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:10,660
This one...

3367
02:42:10,660 --> 02:42:11,640
We'll upgrade next.

3368
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:12,080
Which...

3369
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:13,780
We'll get in no time.

3370
02:42:20,390 --> 02:42:21,710
As we said in off-guide.

3371
02:42:21,830 --> 02:42:22,270
Oh!

3372
02:42:22,270 --> 02:42:22,450
Oh!

3373
02:42:22,550 --> 02:42:22,750
Oh!

3374
02:42:22,750 --> 02:42:22,950
Oh!

3375
02:42:22,950 --> 02:42:23,370
Oh!

3376
02:42:23,370 --> 02:42:23,630
Oh!

3377
02:42:23,630 --> 02:42:23,730
Oh!

3378
02:42:23,730 --> 02:42:23,970
Oh!

3379
02:42:23,970 --> 02:42:24,030
Oh!

3380
02:42:24,030 --> 02:42:24,270
Oh!

3381
02:42:24,290 --> 02:42:24,730
Uh-oh.

3382
02:42:25,130 --> 02:42:25,790
Uh-oh.

3383
02:42:25,790 --> 02:42:26,370
Uh-oh.

3384
02:42:26,390 --> 02:42:26,970
Uh-oh.

3385
02:42:26,970 --> 02:42:27,690
Uh-oh.

3386
02:42:27,710 --> 02:42:28,530
Am I in trouble?

3387
02:42:28,810 --> 02:42:29,770
Nah, we're fine.

3388
02:42:32,250 --> 02:42:37,810
By accepting this money, you must play this game exactly the way I want, despite the fact that I'm perfectly capable of playing it myself.

3389
02:42:39,190 --> 02:42:41,590
We will be reaching 200 at this rate, Minto.

3390
02:42:42,430 --> 02:42:42,870
No!

3391
02:42:42,930 --> 02:42:43,450
Don't say that!

3392
02:42:43,610 --> 02:42:44,350
You're going to jinx it!

3393
02:42:46,730 --> 02:42:47,710
You're going to jinx it!

3394
02:42:47,730 --> 02:42:48,290
You're going to jinx it!

3395
02:42:54,410 --> 02:42:55,130
Supply drop.

3396
02:42:56,250 --> 02:42:56,690
Supply drop.

3397
02:42:57,770 --> 02:42:59,270
You're going to die at 150.

3398
02:43:02,770 --> 02:43:04,630
Will I die this next round?

3399
02:43:04,710 --> 02:43:04,990
140?

3400
02:43:07,810 --> 02:43:08,330
Hiya!

3401
02:43:12,700 --> 02:43:14,020
I guess we'll see.

3402
02:43:16,920 --> 02:43:18,000
Oh, it's fast!

3403
02:43:22,660 --> 02:43:23,340
Uh-oh.

3404
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:24,340
Am I in trouble?

3405
02:43:25,480 --> 02:43:26,720
Am I in trouble for real?

3406
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:27,680
Uh-oh.

3407
02:43:28,140 --> 02:43:28,940
Ruh-roh.

3408
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:30,200
No!

3409
02:43:31,660 --> 02:43:31,980
This is the second one!

3410
02:43:32,840 --> 02:43:33,520
Uh-oh.

3411
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:34,380
Uh-oh.

3412
02:43:34,860 --> 02:43:35,720
Uh-oh.

3413
02:43:36,700 --> 02:43:37,420
Uh-oh.

3414
02:43:38,600 --> 02:43:39,280
Uh-oh.

3415
02:43:39,460 --> 02:43:39,760
Uh-oh.

3416
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:43,320
That was close.

3417
02:43:47,500 --> 02:43:48,500
They stopped it!

3418
02:43:51,690 --> 02:43:52,170
Whoo!

3419
02:43:53,290 --> 02:43:54,790
We were almost in trouble there.

3420
02:43:57,930 --> 02:43:59,390
The bitrate is dying.

3421
02:43:59,590 --> 02:43:59,950
Oh no!

3422
02:44:00,090 --> 02:44:00,910
Does it actually die?

3423
02:44:01,530 --> 02:44:03,010
I didn't even think about that.

3424
02:44:04,270 --> 02:44:05,050
Maybe I should try again.

3425
02:44:05,050 --> 02:44:07,250
I think I get more of these first strike guys though.

3426
02:44:07,470 --> 02:44:10,010
I was thinking, because they're pretty, you know...

3427
02:44:10,010 --> 02:44:11,170
They're pretty good.

3428
02:44:12,090 --> 02:44:13,550
They're pretty good to have on hand.

3429
02:44:17,210 --> 02:44:18,510
You're very crunchy.

3430
02:44:19,170 --> 02:44:19,690
No!

3431
02:44:21,210 --> 02:44:22,730
I'm supposed to be goopy!

3432
02:44:24,150 --> 02:44:25,190
Like ectoplasm.

3433
02:44:25,690 --> 02:44:28,130
One ice monkey took you to a hundred.

3434
02:44:28,350 --> 02:44:30,270
And two ice monkeys are taking you above that.

3435
02:44:31,930 --> 02:44:33,710
Three ice monkeys!

3436
02:44:34,190 --> 02:44:36,290
Even further beyond!

3437
02:44:51,260 --> 02:44:52,960
Mortaring the loopy sections.

3438
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:55,080
Okay, like here?

3439
02:45:00,660 --> 02:45:04,460
Sorry, that scared me so much.

3440
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:19,380
Oh, here we go.

3441
02:45:24,610 --> 02:45:30,510
I think everything, every monkey we have is as upgraded as it possibly can be.

3442
02:45:31,250 --> 02:45:32,310
That's crazy.

3443
02:45:35,770 --> 02:45:39,270
This monkey... Where even is the monkey?

3444
02:45:42,290 --> 02:45:44,090
Where even is the monkey?

3445
02:45:45,110 --> 02:45:47,670
Yeah, we have a thousand lives even.

3446
02:45:47,850 --> 02:45:48,550
We're crazy.

3447
02:45:50,430 --> 02:45:51,630
DDT jump scare.

3448
02:45:53,390 --> 02:45:53,950
Okay.

3449
02:45:54,690 --> 02:45:55,950
We can't die now.

3450
02:45:56,670 --> 02:45:57,570
Not yet.

3451
02:46:01,550 --> 02:46:02,550
Not yet.

3452
02:46:02,910 --> 02:46:03,610
Oh, this one.

3453
02:46:04,770 --> 02:46:06,050
What does this do though?

3454
02:46:07,170 --> 02:46:10,770
Automatically triggers a powerful missile attack whenever MOAB class balloons spawn.

3455
02:46:10,930 --> 02:46:11,730
Ah, neat.

3456
02:46:13,890 --> 02:46:15,910
Minto, it was awesome meeting you on Off Guy.

3457
02:46:16,250 --> 02:46:17,250
Thanks Tiara!

3458
02:46:20,270 --> 02:46:21,970
I know what I'm looking at.

3459
02:46:21,970 --> 02:46:24,090
But I still choose to believe it's an ice monkey carry.

3460
02:46:24,110 --> 02:46:25,130
It is an ice monkey carry.

3461
02:46:25,410 --> 02:46:27,210
You're not choosing that.

3462
02:46:27,550 --> 02:46:30,310
That is the absolute truth of the matter.

3463
02:46:39,620 --> 02:46:40,380
Ta-da!

3464
02:46:48,330 --> 02:46:50,430
I hate having to circle over this though.

3465
02:46:50,470 --> 02:46:51,790
I wish it was an easy collect.

3466
02:46:53,330 --> 02:46:54,790
What else should I add now though?

3467
02:46:56,190 --> 02:46:56,990
What should I...

3468
02:46:56,990 --> 02:46:58,590
Oh, we can add one of these guys.

3469
02:46:58,590 --> 02:46:59,990
We can add probably a wizard monkey.

3470
02:47:00,290 --> 02:47:02,110
We can add both wizard monkeys.

3471
02:47:02,490 --> 02:47:03,970
We can add a necromancer.

3472
02:47:04,250 --> 02:47:05,730
And we can add a phoenix.

3473
02:47:06,430 --> 02:47:06,870
Kiwawa!

3474
02:47:07,050 --> 02:47:08,350
Let's go with Kiwawa now.

3475
02:47:09,370 --> 02:47:11,090
We'll add Kiwawa right here.

3476
02:47:29,670 --> 02:47:31,130
Oh wait, I didn't need that one.

3477
02:47:31,250 --> 02:47:31,530
Oh well.

3478
02:47:34,630 --> 02:47:35,070
Okay.

3479
02:47:35,310 --> 02:47:36,450
Now we'll upgrade.

3480
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:38,090
Max efficiency.

3481
02:47:42,170 --> 02:47:42,290
Cha!

3482
02:47:46,830 --> 02:47:48,230
Oh my god, you're back!

3483
02:47:49,630 --> 02:47:50,710
Can't you be funny?

3484
02:47:50,810 --> 02:47:54,530
Like the person that always was begging for ice monkey?

3485
02:47:56,470 --> 02:47:57,830
Instead of an annoying spam.

3486
02:47:59,690 --> 02:48:01,990
Can't you have funny spam instead?

3487
02:48:08,020 --> 02:48:08,960
Oh, thanks mod.

3488
02:48:09,940 --> 02:48:11,740
Can I get a happy birthday from my Oshie?

3489
02:48:11,820 --> 02:48:14,020
Also, which hero monkey do you want to unlock next?

3490
02:48:15,340 --> 02:48:15,860
Echenane?

3491
02:48:15,860 --> 02:48:16,960
Echenane is my favorite.

3492
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:17,720
I don't know that one.

3493
02:48:17,900 --> 02:48:19,100
Happy birthday people!

3494
02:48:20,440 --> 02:48:23,120
Happy birthday to you.

3495
02:48:23,740 --> 02:48:26,580
Happy birthday to you.

3496
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:30,300
Happy birthday dear people.

3497
02:48:32,880 --> 02:48:36,540
Happy birthday to you.

3498
02:48:38,600 --> 02:48:39,540
Happy birthday!

3499
02:48:42,040 --> 02:48:45,840
Yeah, why can't you guys entertain me instead of me entertaining you?

3500
02:48:48,940 --> 02:48:50,980
You guys are supposed to be the funny ones, huh?

3501
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:55,460
Still cuts a tomato.

3502
02:48:57,280 --> 02:48:58,400
A tomato.

3503
02:48:59,920 --> 02:49:04,020
And look, while they're like everything is blowing... like this guy blows them back.

3504
02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:06,060
That's such a good setup.

3505
02:49:06,240 --> 02:49:08,460
I think this is the ideal setup.

3506
02:49:08,780 --> 02:49:09,240
No!

3507
02:49:09,900 --> 02:49:11,680
Don't copy and paste them.

3508
02:49:12,020 --> 02:49:14,400
I will have you timed out.

3509
02:49:15,260 --> 02:49:15,820
Thank you for watching.

3510
02:49:15,820 --> 02:49:19,320
And that's not a good... Oh, I don't think I pressed it.

3511
02:49:19,720 --> 02:49:22,140
That's not a good time-out.

3512
02:49:23,260 --> 02:49:24,200
Time-out of shame.

3513
02:49:30,580 --> 02:49:32,260
Do they have a wizard monkey?

3514
02:49:32,740 --> 02:49:33,800
I have a wizard monkey.

3515
02:49:34,140 --> 02:49:35,480
I'm gonna put a second wizard monkey.

3516
02:49:35,960 --> 02:49:40,140
Second wizard monkey will go... Wait, no, I want second wizard monkey to get the...

3517
02:49:40,140 --> 02:49:40,300
Here.

3518
02:49:42,480 --> 02:49:43,320
This is...

3519
02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:45,160
Necrom... Oh!

3520
02:49:46,020 --> 02:49:47,520
Okay, we're already necromancing.

3521
02:49:47,680 --> 02:49:48,100
Holy cow.

3522
02:49:48,320 --> 02:49:49,160
Okay, never mind.

3523
02:49:50,360 --> 02:49:51,980
Wall of fire right there as well.

3524
02:49:55,620 --> 02:49:56,500
Oh my god!

3525
02:49:56,600 --> 02:49:57,300
There they go!

3526
02:50:14,340 --> 02:50:19,300
I know we've spent a lot of money to get him, but he could just go immediately...

3527
02:50:19,300 --> 02:50:20,420
Like, you know?

3528
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:24,740
Two men were robbing a liquor store.

3529
02:50:25,060 --> 02:50:27,380
And the first one says, this is whisky.

3530
02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:32,100
His partner shrugs and says, yeah, but not as whisky as robbing a...

3531
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:37,440
This is whisky.

3532
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:42,060
They would steal things with a 50k.

3533
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:49,440
This is whisky.

3534
02:50:50,840 --> 02:50:52,040
Hello, kitten.

3535
02:50:52,860 --> 02:50:55,720
Could you please answer the phone right now?

3536
02:50:56,460 --> 02:50:58,800
It's no master calling.

3537
02:51:02,320 --> 02:51:03,600
Hello, kitten.

3538
02:51:04,540 --> 02:51:07,820
It's pretty whisky that you're not answering right now.

3539
02:51:09,060 --> 02:51:17,700
But I would think that you would pick up the phone in about five seconds.

3540
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:19,040
Or else.

3541
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:21,420
I'm going to get very angry.

3542
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:32,740
How's the bitrate, everybody?

3543
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:33,620
Am I crunchy?

3544
02:51:34,380 --> 02:51:35,560
How's the bitrate?

3545
02:51:41,450 --> 02:51:42,090
Nice.

3546
02:51:42,950 --> 02:51:44,910
I'm putting you in the contraption.

3547
02:51:47,010 --> 02:51:48,210
Very crunchy.

3548
02:51:48,930 --> 02:51:50,290
Still strong, actually.

3549
02:51:59,450 --> 02:52:02,350
I didn't go to Off-Kai, so here's a regular streamer tax.

3550
02:52:02,550 --> 02:52:03,590
Thank you.

3551
02:52:04,490 --> 02:52:06,190
Very crunchy ectoplasm.

3552
02:52:08,950 --> 02:52:11,550
We're halfway there to full Phoenix.

3553
02:52:11,810 --> 02:52:12,790
Lord Phoenix.

3554
02:52:12,870 --> 02:52:13,450
I'm so sorry.

3555
02:52:14,970 --> 02:52:17,570
We should start calling Kiara that.

3556
02:52:17,610 --> 02:52:18,690
Lord Phoenix.

3557
02:52:19,070 --> 02:52:21,590
Look at, you see the DDTs like come up and stop.

3558
02:52:22,050 --> 02:52:22,890
It's crazy.

3559
02:52:24,350 --> 02:52:25,270
It's crazy.

3560
02:52:30,620 --> 02:52:31,180
Wow.

3561
02:52:32,440 --> 02:52:35,660
Who said that level 150 was going to kill me?

3562
02:52:35,900 --> 02:52:37,520
You didn't die at 150.

3563
02:52:39,140 --> 02:52:39,700
Yeah.

3564
02:52:41,600 --> 02:52:42,720
I didn't.

3565
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:46,440
Ooh, it's coming in hot.

3566
02:52:47,280 --> 02:52:48,680
Ooh, it's coming in hot.

3567
02:52:59,360 --> 02:53:01,660
I think that move is not so great.

3568
02:53:01,760 --> 02:53:03,180
It's better if like...

3569
02:53:03,920 --> 02:53:06,660
There's a lot of bloons everywhere.

3570
02:53:06,660 --> 02:53:08,700
She's got to clean up, you know.

3571
02:53:10,240 --> 02:53:10,680
Money?

3572
02:53:13,180 --> 02:53:14,020
Go for 200.

3573
02:53:14,420 --> 02:53:15,180
Oh shoot.

3574
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:16,460
Oh, you guys, we're in trouble.

3575
02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:19,460
We're in trouble.

3576
02:53:19,560 --> 02:53:20,020
We're in trouble.

3577
02:53:21,880 --> 02:53:23,980
I just realized how far that got.

3578
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:26,720
Yo, we were so in trouble.

3579
02:53:27,400 --> 02:53:28,320
But we were fine.

3580
02:53:31,580 --> 02:53:33,300
We were in trouble, but we're fine.

3581
02:53:52,700 --> 02:53:54,140
But I'm

3582
02:53:57,530 --> 02:53:57,530
not.

3583
02:53:57,530 --> 02:53:57,630
I'm done, I'm done.

3584
02:53:57,630 --> 02:53:58,430
Oh no.

3585
02:54:00,730 --> 02:54:01,450
I've done everything I can.

3586
02:54:01,450 --> 02:54:01,790
And done...

3587
02:54:06,490 --> 02:54:07,690
And done...

3588
02:54:17,100 --> 02:54:17,820
Hmm.

3589
02:54:20,900 --> 02:54:21,620
Oh no.

3590
02:54:21,620 --> 02:54:22,880
I already got all these guys.

3591
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:27,720
Um...

3592
02:54:28,980 --> 02:54:30,800
We could get this guy.

3593
02:54:30,900 --> 02:54:32,280
Or a Bomb Blitz.

3594
02:54:32,280 --> 02:54:32,340
Blitz.

3595
02:54:37,970 --> 02:54:39,730
Would a bomb blitz be worth it?

3596
02:54:43,650 --> 02:54:47,890
I don't have so many... There's also this guy, but...

3597
02:54:47,890 --> 02:54:49,150
Oh, I have the Juggernaut!

3598
02:54:49,470 --> 02:54:50,170
I forgot!

3599
02:54:50,590 --> 02:54:51,990
Wait, isn't he really good?

3600
02:54:52,750 --> 02:54:54,810
I think I should get him though, right?

3601
02:54:55,730 --> 02:54:59,210
This guy will have stuff sending all over the place, right?

3602
02:55:06,260 --> 02:55:07,300
Oh, it's not that great?

3603
02:55:07,300 --> 02:55:08,100
Oh.

3604
02:55:08,960 --> 02:55:09,880
Not really?

3605
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:10,200
Oh.

3606
02:55:19,060 --> 02:55:22,320
I guess it just says only fortify lead boon.

3607
02:55:22,460 --> 02:55:23,980
It doesn't even... Oh god.

3608
02:55:25,060 --> 02:55:26,580
What else can I get?

3609
02:55:31,520 --> 02:55:33,780
We need a million XP.

3610
02:55:39,150 --> 02:55:40,570
Hmm... Pirate Monkey.

3611
02:55:41,210 --> 02:55:41,950
Oh wait.

3612
02:55:45,820 --> 02:55:46,420
What?

3613
02:55:46,840 --> 02:55:48,580
Why does it keep... Pirate Monkey.

3614
02:55:52,670 --> 02:55:53,470
Plane Monkey?

3615
02:55:54,770 --> 02:55:56,730
Do you have a middle path gatling gun?

3616
02:56:00,920 --> 02:56:02,320
I'm working on it.

3617
02:56:08,620 --> 02:56:11,680
Hmm... Maybe I can have him up here.

3618
02:56:12,040 --> 02:56:13,380
And firing down.

3619
02:56:15,120 --> 02:56:17,160
Or here, and firing down.

3620
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:19,420
Maybe they can...

3621
02:56:21,020 --> 02:56:22,240
They can...

3622
02:56:22,240 --> 02:56:24,860
But I have a lot to go.

3623
02:56:25,860 --> 02:56:27,880
Until 60,000 to unlock that.

3624
02:56:31,780 --> 02:56:35,620
Middle path boat insta-kill ZOMGs.

3625
02:56:35,920 --> 02:56:36,640
Yeah, yeah.

3626
02:56:36,680 --> 02:56:39,580
I've been using that one.

3627
02:56:39,720 --> 02:56:40,720
I already have it.

3628
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:44,960
The preemptive strike and stuff.

3629
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:45,660
Mm-hmm.

3630
02:56:47,660 --> 02:56:49,380
What if our lasers touch?

3631
02:56:49,700 --> 02:56:50,280
Woo!

3632
02:56:52,460 --> 02:56:54,780
Oh, the bow!

3633
02:56:55,140 --> 02:56:56,140
Oh, bow.

3634
02:56:56,860 --> 02:56:57,500
Oh.

3635
02:56:57,760 --> 02:56:59,620
I keep showing right this show.

3636
02:56:59,840 --> 02:57:00,700
This one.

3637
02:57:00,920 --> 02:57:01,940
The Pirate Lord.

3638
02:57:03,860 --> 02:57:04,760
Oh, okay.

3639
02:57:04,840 --> 02:57:06,480
Let's go for it.

3640
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:08,220
It's gonna take a while.

3641
02:57:09,500 --> 02:57:11,380
But we can...

3642
02:57:11,380 --> 02:57:13,180
We'll put him in here.

3643
02:57:13,760 --> 02:57:15,060
We'll put him in here.

3644
02:57:16,620 --> 02:57:17,700
Sign him up.

3645
02:57:29,120 --> 02:57:31,220
And we're also trying to get to 50,000.

3646
02:57:31,440 --> 02:57:32,840
Oh my God!

3647
02:57:33,240 --> 02:57:33,920
Oh my God!

3648
02:57:36,260 --> 02:57:36,820
Blalalalalalalalalala!

3649
02:57:38,560 --> 02:57:39,400
Oh, I...

3650
02:57:39,400 --> 02:57:41,080
50,000 please!

3651
02:57:42,320 --> 02:57:43,540
50,000 please!

3652
02:57:46,220 --> 02:57:46,780
Please!

3653
02:57:49,060 --> 02:57:50,800
Why don't I have enough money yet?

3654
02:57:52,220 --> 02:57:52,660
No!

3655
02:57:58,640 --> 02:58:00,820
One pirate ship can eat three MOABs.

3656
02:58:00,820 --> 02:58:01,060
Dang!

3657
02:58:01,240 --> 02:58:01,440
Okay.

3658
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:02,900
Good to know for...

3659
02:58:03,680 --> 02:58:06,020
For this to go down this way then.

3660
02:58:06,840 --> 02:58:08,160
I mean, I do like this one.

3661
02:58:08,700 --> 02:58:11,540
Really improve power and can shoot three grappling hooks at once.

3662
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:13,980
Plundering extra cash from each MOAB.

3663
02:58:14,220 --> 02:58:14,660
Woo!

3664
02:58:15,040 --> 02:58:15,480
Okay.

3665
02:58:15,660 --> 02:58:16,100
Alright.

3666
02:58:16,400 --> 02:58:18,500
Let's hope that we can get the money.

3667
02:58:18,500 --> 02:58:18,920
Here we go.

3668
02:58:24,620 --> 02:58:26,200
I don't know what I just did.

3669
02:58:26,360 --> 02:58:26,640
But...

3670
02:58:26,640 --> 02:58:30,420
Oh, we have super crazy birds flying around now.

3671
02:58:31,900 --> 02:58:32,580
Oh, nice!

3672
02:58:34,060 --> 02:58:35,140
I think we're good.

3673
02:58:35,440 --> 02:58:37,500
And we should probably increase this as well.

3674
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:39,640
So that we can get...

3675
02:58:40,500 --> 02:58:41,920
Pops by 100%.

3676
02:58:42,520 --> 02:58:43,460
For... yes.

3677
02:58:43,740 --> 02:58:44,440
Okay, nice.

3678
02:58:44,440 --> 02:58:46,420
So this is our next thing.

3679
02:58:46,480 --> 02:58:47,180
40,000.

3680
02:59:07,520 --> 02:59:08,480
Uh-oh.

3681
02:59:08,520 --> 02:59:09,060
Oh,

3682
02:59:12,460 --> 02:59:12,800
please!

3683
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:18,320
Oh, wait.

3684
02:59:18,500 --> 02:59:19,540
It does another loop?

3685
02:59:19,980 --> 02:59:20,820
No way.

3686
02:59:22,740 --> 02:59:23,380
Oh,

3687
02:59:27,480 --> 02:59:28,120
just kidding.

3688
02:59:28,380 --> 02:59:28,820
Dang.

3689
02:59:29,500 --> 02:59:30,960
We were not...

3690
02:59:32,560 --> 02:59:34,040
We were not up to stuff.

3691
02:59:35,160 --> 02:59:36,100
Ripperoni, everybody.

3692
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:40,000
All of our lives that we saved up.

3693
02:59:40,040 --> 02:59:40,120
All of our lives that we saved up.

3694
02:59:40,120 --> 02:59:40,640
That we accumulated.

3695
02:59:41,320 --> 02:59:44,000
Take my first time ever giving money to a streamer.

3696
02:59:44,040 --> 02:59:45,240
Thank you!

3697
02:59:45,680 --> 02:59:48,800
Weird ghost that for some reason uses real currency.

3698
02:59:49,340 --> 02:59:49,900
Hey.

3699
02:59:50,460 --> 02:59:55,580
The afterlife is just like real life.

3700
02:59:55,780 --> 02:59:55,820
The afterlife is just like real life.

3701
02:59:55,820 --> 02:59:55,980
The afterlife is just like real life.

3702
02:59:55,980 --> 02:59:56,200
I think.

3703
02:59:57,620 --> 02:59:58,560
GG, everybody.

3704
03:00:00,700 --> 03:00:02,140
That was an amazing run though.

3705
03:00:02,280 --> 03:00:03,760
That was the furthest I've ever been ever.

3706
03:00:04,800 --> 03:00:05,280
Oh.

3707
03:00:05,700 --> 03:00:06,400
Go away.

3708
03:00:06,760 --> 03:00:07,240
Cancel.

3709
03:00:07,780 --> 03:00:10,280
That was the furthest I've ever been ever.

3710
03:00:11,480 --> 03:00:12,880
So I'm pretty proud of ourselves.

3711
03:00:13,260 --> 03:00:14,840
Have 1,000 lives in a single...

3712
03:00:14,840 --> 03:00:15,320
We did that!

3713
03:00:15,560 --> 03:00:15,940
We did that!

3714
03:00:22,100 --> 03:00:22,580
GG.

3715
03:00:25,960 --> 03:00:26,440
GG.

3716
03:00:26,720 --> 03:00:28,620
Pretty good for someone not even level 50.

3717
03:00:28,620 --> 03:00:29,780
That's what I'm saying.

3718
03:00:30,200 --> 03:00:31,120
That's what I'm saying.

3719
03:00:33,020 --> 03:00:33,500
Yeah.

3720
03:00:34,640 --> 03:00:36,200
You can make it to 200 someday.

3721
03:00:36,300 --> 03:00:36,680
I believe.

3722
03:00:37,320 --> 03:00:38,900
I told you guys not to jinx it.

3723
03:00:39,160 --> 03:00:39,640
Gosh.

3724
03:00:40,920 --> 03:00:42,440
Well now I don't have to stand.

3725
03:00:43,480 --> 03:00:44,520
I can be big.

3726
03:00:45,340 --> 03:00:46,480
I can be big.

3727
03:00:48,120 --> 03:00:48,760
Big toe.

3728
03:00:49,820 --> 03:00:50,740
Big mean toe.

3729
03:00:50,940 --> 03:00:51,700
Bigger mean toe.

3730
03:00:56,520 --> 03:00:57,000
Yay!

3731
03:00:59,740 --> 03:01:00,460
Yippee.

3732
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:03,180
Big toe.

3733
03:01:03,420 --> 03:01:04,460
Big mean toe.

3734
03:01:04,880 --> 03:01:06,020
Big toe.

3735
03:01:06,960 --> 03:01:08,840
Big mean toe.

3736
03:01:09,520 --> 03:01:10,580
Big toe.

3737
03:01:12,640 --> 03:01:13,660
Big toe.

3738
03:01:14,300 --> 03:01:14,440
Big toe.

3739
03:01:23,430 --> 03:01:25,530
I looked away for one minute, VTuber.

3740
03:01:25,790 --> 03:01:26,610
What did you do?

3741
03:01:27,350 --> 03:01:29,110
I didn't delete Ice Monkey.

3742
03:01:29,710 --> 03:01:30,810
I promise.

3743
03:01:33,630 --> 03:01:35,070
Clearly you needed more time.

3744
03:01:35,090 --> 03:01:35,690
More corn soup.

3745
03:01:35,930 --> 03:01:36,550
And helicopter.

3746
03:01:38,810 --> 03:01:39,170
Clearly.

3747
03:01:39,610 --> 03:01:41,330
Well guys, that was good.

3748
03:01:41,510 --> 03:01:41,830
GG.

3749
03:01:42,390 --> 03:01:45,870
I know that was one of the easier maps.

3750
03:01:46,430 --> 03:01:51,710
But that was a good taste of how crazy it can get.

3751
03:01:53,330 --> 03:01:54,050
Right?

3752
03:01:56,810 --> 03:01:58,430
Big mean toe.

3753
03:01:59,470 --> 03:02:01,550
Big mean toe.

3754
03:02:09,080 --> 03:02:10,940
Resort is classified as the easiest.

3755
03:02:11,220 --> 03:02:12,280
Yeah, it is pretty easy.

3756
03:02:12,540 --> 03:02:14,600
I think it is the easiest.

3757
03:02:14,880 --> 03:02:16,740
Like, I can agree with the classification.

3758
03:02:17,340 --> 03:02:18,880
Please stop talking about toes.

3759
03:02:21,160 --> 03:02:21,720
Sorry.

3760
03:02:22,720 --> 03:02:23,500
Dog strings!

3761
03:02:23,720 --> 03:02:25,020
Thanks for the five gifted!

3762
03:02:25,320 --> 03:02:26,120
Thank you!

3763
03:02:27,320 --> 03:02:29,660
Is this why Mean Toe has only nine toes?

3764
03:02:29,700 --> 03:02:31,020
And then I'm the tenth!

3765
03:02:33,540 --> 03:02:35,920
Nine toes and then a standing toe.

3766
03:02:35,960 --> 03:02:37,080
I'm standing tall.

3767
03:02:37,160 --> 03:02:38,240
The tenth toe.

3768
03:02:41,120 --> 03:02:41,980
You mean...

3769
03:02:41,980 --> 03:02:43,240
You mean toe?

3770
03:02:50,480 --> 03:02:52,360
Resort, Cubism and Logs.

3771
03:02:53,220 --> 03:02:53,740
Logs.

3772
03:02:55,300 --> 03:02:55,820
Logs.

3773
03:02:56,260 --> 03:02:56,940
Hold on.

3774
03:02:57,040 --> 03:02:57,440
Let's see.

3775
03:03:00,360 --> 03:03:00,880
Cubism?

3776
03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:04,200
Oh, I was thinking of tree stump instead of logs.

3777
03:03:04,480 --> 03:03:05,000
Uh...

3778
03:03:06,280 --> 03:03:06,800
Cubism.

3779
03:03:08,660 --> 03:03:09,700
Oh, this one!

3780
03:03:12,100 --> 03:03:13,100
And lo...

3781
03:03:13,100 --> 03:03:14,020
Oh, I'm blocking logs.

3782
03:03:16,860 --> 03:03:17,460
Logs.

3783
03:03:21,900 --> 03:03:23,440
Logs looks pretty easy too.

3784
03:03:24,040 --> 03:03:27,140
But things when they like overlap a lot is...

3785
03:03:27,140 --> 03:03:28,600
Yeah, I can see it.

3786
03:03:29,140 --> 03:03:29,740
Expert.

3787
03:03:32,320 --> 03:03:33,400
Darkest Dungeon.

3788
03:03:34,460 --> 03:03:35,640
My sanctuary.

3789
03:03:37,400 --> 03:03:38,340
Hashtag ouch.

3790
03:03:40,020 --> 03:03:41,040
What does that mean?

3791
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:41,260
Man.

3792
03:03:41,360 --> 03:03:41,520
Oh.

3793
03:03:45,240 --> 03:03:46,820
Oh, I can unlock some of these though.

3794
03:03:47,300 --> 03:03:48,200
It's kind of fun.

3795
03:03:48,320 --> 03:03:49,180
Off the coast.

3796
03:03:50,340 --> 03:03:51,300
High Finance.

3797
03:03:52,500 --> 03:03:52,980
Cornfield!

3798
03:03:59,560 --> 03:04:02,220
Just got my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering.

3799
03:04:03,380 --> 03:04:06,000
And moved into a new apartment a few days ago.

3800
03:04:06,120 --> 03:04:07,100
Let's go, Liam Stewart!

3801
03:04:07,280 --> 03:04:07,680
Congratulations!

3802
03:04:09,820 --> 03:04:10,300
Corn.

3803
03:04:10,300 --> 03:04:10,580
Corn.

3804
03:04:11,260 --> 03:04:11,900
Corn.

3805
03:04:12,520 --> 03:04:16,160
I love corn soup.

3806
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:17,700
Actually, I just love corn.

3807
03:04:18,240 --> 03:04:21,860
I took Matara to Pepper Lunch for the first time.

3808
03:04:22,180 --> 03:04:25,620
And she was like, The corn was a good idea.

3809
03:04:26,280 --> 03:04:29,180
I was like, corn is always a good idea.

3810
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:33,060
Corn is always...

3811
03:04:34,200 --> 03:04:35,440
the best.

3812
03:04:39,220 --> 03:04:40,580
Yeah, it is.

3813
03:04:44,760 --> 03:04:45,440
So...

3814
03:04:45,440 --> 03:04:51,840
I don't really have a schedule since I didn't expect to be home a little early.

3815
03:04:53,180 --> 03:04:53,520
So...

3816
03:04:55,160 --> 03:04:57,660
But I'll be streaming tomorrow as well.

3817
03:04:58,180 --> 03:04:59,440
Don't know what yet.

3818
03:04:59,800 --> 03:05:01,040
We'll figure something out.

3819
03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:03,880
Um...

3820
03:05:06,120 --> 03:05:06,880
And...

3821
03:05:08,740 --> 03:05:09,500
Yeah.

3822
03:05:09,960 --> 03:05:11,260
I'm not quite sure what.

3823
03:05:11,540 --> 03:05:12,540
Same time tomorrow?

3824
03:05:12,840 --> 03:05:14,880
Same time, same place.

3825
03:05:15,260 --> 03:05:17,720
Same minty fresh channel.

3826
03:05:20,280 --> 03:05:22,060
Balloons same time tomorrow.

3827
03:05:23,620 --> 03:05:24,380
Imagine.

3828
03:05:26,460 --> 03:05:27,220
No.

3829
03:05:29,160 --> 03:05:31,320
I'm not gonna do balloons two days in a row.

3830
03:05:32,580 --> 03:05:34,700
That would be crazy talk.

3831
03:05:35,440 --> 03:05:35,900
I could...

3832
03:05:44,550 --> 03:05:44,950
No!

3833
03:05:47,270 --> 03:05:48,610
Don't even tempt me.

3834
03:05:49,290 --> 03:05:50,090
You temptress.

3835
03:05:50,970 --> 03:05:52,290
Stop being such a temptress.

3836
03:05:52,450 --> 03:05:54,670
Stop being so seductive right now.

3837
03:05:54,830 --> 03:05:54,990
Okay?

3838
03:05:58,470 --> 03:06:01,010
As an expert at this game, I'd like to offer you my recommendations.

3839
03:06:01,430 --> 03:06:04,110
The secret to winning is to buy monkeys and place them to pop balloons.

3840
03:06:06,470 --> 03:06:06,870
Riveting.

3841
03:06:08,250 --> 03:06:08,650
Advice.

3842
03:06:09,810 --> 03:06:10,830
I'll try that next time.

3843
03:06:11,110 --> 03:06:11,790
Thank you.

3844
03:06:14,150 --> 03:06:15,550
Sorry, can't help it.

3845
03:06:21,140 --> 03:06:21,600
Yeah.

3846
03:06:26,280 --> 03:06:26,740
Yeah.

3847
03:06:29,840 --> 03:06:30,300
Yeah.

3848
03:06:46,240 --> 03:06:46,700
Balloons.

3849
03:06:47,020 --> 03:06:48,080
Hope you feel better soon.

3850
03:06:48,220 --> 03:06:49,580
Thank you, I'm already feeling better.

3851
03:06:50,180 --> 03:06:50,640
Truly.

3852
03:06:50,640 --> 03:06:52,660
Like, I'm congested, but...

3853
03:06:53,480 --> 03:06:54,520
I even feel like...

3854
03:06:54,520 --> 03:06:56,080
Hold on, I'm gonna drink some of this green tea.

3855
03:06:56,260 --> 03:06:57,640
I hope I can taste it.

3856
03:06:58,120 --> 03:06:58,800
Yum yum yum yum.

3857
03:07:00,220 --> 03:07:00,660
I

3858
03:07:09,990 --> 03:07:13,270
actually couldn't taste it earlier, but now I can even a little.

3859
03:07:16,290 --> 03:07:17,290
Balloons is the cure!

3860
03:07:19,270 --> 03:07:21,830
I'm diseased and balloons is the cure, everybody!

3861
03:07:22,270 --> 03:07:22,710
Balloons...

3862
03:07:29,120 --> 03:07:30,720
So you'll let me play balloons tomorrow?

3863
03:07:30,720 --> 03:07:32,140
No, I'm not gonna play balloons tomorrow.

3864
03:07:32,280 --> 03:07:33,140
Don't worry, don't worry.

3865
03:07:36,720 --> 03:07:38,220
We found the cure.

3866
03:07:39,200 --> 03:07:40,840
I'm just gonna play more of it tonight.

3867
03:07:43,040 --> 03:07:44,600
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

3868
03:07:44,820 --> 03:07:45,680
And Johnny!

3869
03:07:46,040 --> 03:07:47,500
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

3870
03:07:47,600 --> 03:07:48,220
Thank you!

3871
03:07:49,120 --> 03:07:50,720
Edward, thank you for 2 months!

3872
03:07:50,940 --> 03:07:51,340
Thank you!

3873
03:07:51,400 --> 03:07:52,340
There were so many...

3874
03:07:52,340 --> 03:07:57,960
I think notifications were really backed up, so there's a lot of donos that didn't show up.

3875
03:07:57,960 --> 03:07:59,760
So, DavidTitanium, thank you!

3876
03:08:01,040 --> 03:08:04,080
I got my Tetrio Sprint... That's what we'll do tomorrow!

3877
03:08:04,860 --> 03:08:05,780
We'll play Tetrio.

3878
03:08:06,020 --> 03:08:09,640
Actually, I thought about it for today, but I was like my brain's gonna be too smart... small.

3879
03:08:09,860 --> 03:08:10,560
Too smart?

3880
03:08:10,740 --> 03:08:12,020
No, too slow.

3881
03:08:12,600 --> 03:08:14,140
Tomorrow we'll play Tetrio.

3882
03:08:16,520 --> 03:08:19,300
So you can all thank DavidTitanium for that.

3883
03:08:20,920 --> 03:08:23,640
I got my Tetrio Sprint record down to 50 seconds.

3884
03:08:23,740 --> 03:08:24,260
Glad you're back.

3885
03:08:24,340 --> 03:08:25,480
I can't stop playing that game.

3886
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:27,940
I haven't played Tetrio in a long time.

3887
03:08:27,960 --> 03:08:30,780
So, it'll be a great Zatsudan game, right?

3888
03:08:31,100 --> 03:08:33,400
What a great yapping game.

3889
03:08:35,320 --> 03:08:36,220
Teemo, thank you!

3890
03:08:36,900 --> 03:08:37,980
Cool things Mint does.

3891
03:08:38,220 --> 03:08:38,540
Be Mint.

3892
03:08:38,760 --> 03:08:39,620
Stream Be Mint.

3893
03:08:39,760 --> 03:08:40,500
Tweet Be Mint.

3894
03:08:42,940 --> 03:08:45,600
Did you know I've been a number for 2 months?

3895
03:08:45,900 --> 03:08:46,280
Yippee!

3896
03:08:46,520 --> 03:08:47,300
Thank you!

3897
03:08:53,900 --> 03:08:55,920
Glad to hear you're doing better, Minta.

3898
03:08:56,020 --> 03:09:00,200
I'll rest up some more so we can do more big brain bloons.

3899
03:09:00,260 --> 03:09:01,280
Thank you, Servo!

3900
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:04,960
Thank you!

3901
03:09:06,160 --> 03:09:07,520
Thank you!

3902
03:09:08,860 --> 03:09:10,140
Thank you!

3903
03:09:10,780 --> 03:09:14,840
I found out my Waka vendor listed a Metal Gear Arcade machine.

3904
03:09:20,080 --> 03:09:20,760
Interested?

3905
03:09:21,460 --> 03:09:22,140
Yes.

3906
03:09:26,170 --> 03:09:26,850
Yes.

3907
03:09:26,870 --> 03:09:29,370
I'm interested in the Metal Gear Arcade machine.

3908
03:09:33,460 --> 03:09:34,300
I'm interested.

3909
03:09:35,500 --> 03:09:36,300
I'm interested.

3910
03:09:37,360 --> 03:09:37,900
I'm interested.

3911
03:09:37,900 --> 03:09:39,120
Please give me their contact information.

3912
03:09:51,560 --> 03:09:52,480
Please give me their contact information.

3913
03:09:52,820 --> 03:09:53,760
Thank you!

3914
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:55,080
Thank you!

3915
03:09:56,700 --> 03:09:58,360
Heard you held hands with a vampire.

3916
03:09:59,200 --> 03:10:00,440
What, me and Maria?

3917
03:10:01,580 --> 03:10:03,140
Yeah, we might have held hands.

3918
03:10:04,120 --> 03:10:04,660
Um...

3919
03:10:05,220 --> 03:10:07,900
Actually, I think I was the one who grabbed her head.

3920
03:10:10,940 --> 03:10:12,140
I think I was the one who grabbed her head.

3921
03:10:12,140 --> 03:10:12,520
I think I went in first.

3922
03:10:13,140 --> 03:10:14,560
Thanks for the vibe!

3923
03:10:15,760 --> 03:10:16,440
Thank you!

3924
03:10:17,960 --> 03:10:18,760
Eventual ghosts.

3925
03:10:19,120 --> 03:10:21,000
That sounds about right.

3926
03:10:21,120 --> 03:10:21,760
Hope you feel better.

3927
03:10:21,860 --> 03:10:22,520
Thank you so much!

3928
03:10:24,140 --> 03:10:25,000
So forward.

3929
03:10:30,140 --> 03:10:34,120
It's because, you know, Off-Kai gave me so much energy, so I felt like a little...

3930
03:10:34,120 --> 03:10:36,040
I was like a kind of... I felt...

3931
03:10:36,040 --> 03:10:37,840
Um... What's the word?

3932
03:10:38,640 --> 03:10:39,160
Corporeal.

3933
03:10:40,500 --> 03:10:41,540
When... Corporeal.

3934
03:10:42,360 --> 03:10:44,760
When I can manifest physically.

3935
03:10:46,280 --> 03:10:49,540
I was absorbing so much life energy that I was... Maybe...

3936
03:10:49,540 --> 03:10:51,760
That can't be why everybody got sick, right?

3937
03:10:53,700 --> 03:10:54,220
Corporeal.

3938
03:10:55,520 --> 03:10:56,040
Corporeal.

3939
03:10:56,980 --> 03:10:57,500
Corporeal.

3940
03:10:58,660 --> 03:11:00,600
First off, Kai was really fun for me too.

3941
03:11:00,840 --> 03:11:01,820
Thank you!

3942
03:11:01,960 --> 03:11:02,560
We're going!

3943
03:11:03,100 --> 03:11:04,120
I hope you... I hope...

3944
03:11:04,120 --> 03:11:04,780
Wait.

3945
03:11:04,900 --> 03:11:05,240
No.

3946
03:11:05,360 --> 03:11:06,020
I hope...

3947
03:11:06,040 --> 03:11:07,780
I'm glad you had fun.

3948
03:11:09,940 --> 03:11:11,180
Corporeal.

3949
03:11:13,900 --> 03:11:15,260
Golden Foxy, thank you!

3950
03:11:15,720 --> 03:11:16,540
Happy birthday!

3951
03:11:17,140 --> 03:11:19,800
Happy birthday to you!

3952
03:11:20,240 --> 03:11:23,080
Happy birthday to you!

3953
03:11:23,680 --> 03:11:27,420
Happy birthday Golden Foxy!

3954
03:11:28,200 --> 03:11:32,320
Happy birthday to you!

3955
03:11:33,600 --> 03:11:36,360
Travis Thank you!

3956
03:11:37,660 --> 03:11:41,240
I think that's all of them that didn't make it through.

3957
03:11:41,540 --> 03:11:43,440
So thank you guys for the donuts as well.

3958
03:11:43,660 --> 03:11:46,720
Sorry that they got all blocked up by...

3959
03:11:47,280 --> 03:11:49,540
They got all blocked by the...

3960
03:11:50,080 --> 03:11:51,920
By the... By the gifted donuts.

3961
03:11:52,280 --> 03:11:53,580
But um... Yes.

3962
03:11:53,700 --> 03:11:54,480
I still see you.

3963
03:11:56,060 --> 03:11:56,940
I see you.

3964
03:11:57,400 --> 03:11:58,120
Thank you.

3965
03:12:07,740 --> 03:12:09,400
The gift wall remains strong.

3966
03:12:09,660 --> 03:12:10,200
Yes it does.

3967
03:12:10,880 --> 03:12:14,000
It's funny because I'll leave OBS open after I...

3968
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:16,560
After I stream and eventually I'll hear a...

3969
03:12:19,800 --> 03:12:21,920
I miss you a bunch!

3970
03:12:22,160 --> 03:12:22,980
Thank you!

3971
03:12:23,960 --> 03:12:26,280
I miss you guys too but I'm back now.

3972
03:12:27,720 --> 03:12:29,360
At least until AX.

3973
03:12:30,160 --> 03:12:32,340
And then I'll be performing there.

3974
03:12:34,120 --> 03:12:35,180
Performing at the concert.

3975
03:12:35,300 --> 03:12:36,160
Not at AX.

3976
03:12:36,280 --> 03:12:37,960
You don't need an AX ticket to go...

3977
03:12:37,960 --> 03:12:39,060
To go watch.

3978
03:12:40,920 --> 03:12:41,960
But uh...

3979
03:12:43,900 --> 03:12:44,420
Um...

3980
03:12:45,320 --> 03:12:45,840
Oh!

3981
03:12:46,560 --> 03:12:47,080
Wait!

3982
03:12:47,540 --> 03:12:50,440
Maybe I should add toot-a-doo to my list shouldn't I?

3983
03:13:16,570 --> 03:13:20,190
My brain just had to upload in response to the toot-a-doo.

3984
03:13:23,270 --> 03:13:23,790
Sorry.

3985
03:13:24,090 --> 03:13:24,430
Sorry.

3986
03:13:24,550 --> 03:13:25,830
Maybe I should add one.

3987
03:13:26,430 --> 03:13:27,610
I'll think about it.

3988
03:13:29,630 --> 03:13:30,150
Anyway...

3989
03:13:30,150 --> 03:13:30,970
I should go, right?

3990
03:13:31,150 --> 03:13:31,690
I should go.

3991
03:13:32,130 --> 03:13:35,730
It is a cute sound and I love Steins Gate so...

3992
03:13:36,190 --> 03:13:37,650
Don't mess a fiction show up!

3993
03:13:38,550 --> 03:13:40,090
Why you guys have made to me?

3994
03:13:43,650 --> 03:13:44,170
Oh...

3995
03:13:44,170 --> 03:13:45,310
There's a story...

3996
03:13:46,150 --> 03:13:49,330
That only the maid cafe knows at Ofukai.

3997
03:13:51,090 --> 03:13:51,610
Um...

3998
03:13:52,170 --> 03:13:52,690
After...

3999
03:13:52,690 --> 03:13:55,190
The maid cafe closed...

4000
03:13:55,190 --> 03:13:57,170
They did a special... It was so funny.

4001
03:13:57,390 --> 03:13:59,190
They opened it especially...

4002
03:13:59,830 --> 03:14:01,190
It was for like Matara and I.

4003
03:14:03,090 --> 03:14:03,810
And um...

4004
03:14:04,310 --> 03:14:05,670
And I was uh...

4005
03:14:06,450 --> 03:14:07,830
I was like hanging out...

4006
03:14:07,830 --> 03:14:08,390
With some friends.

4007
03:14:09,070 --> 03:14:10,630
And Matara like called me.

4008
03:14:10,690 --> 03:14:11,550
And she's like, where are you?

4009
03:14:11,670 --> 03:14:14,030
You said you were gonna come to the maid cafe.

4010
03:14:14,370 --> 03:14:15,050
And I was like, ah!

4011
03:14:16,230 --> 03:14:19,050
I gotta drop some stuff off in my room and then I'll come back!

4012
03:14:20,210 --> 03:14:20,930
And um...

4013
03:14:21,470 --> 03:14:22,610
I went and did that.

4014
03:14:22,770 --> 03:14:24,250
And she was like, how long do you think it'll be?

4015
03:14:24,410 --> 03:14:26,010
And I was like, f-f-five minutes!

4016
03:14:26,010 --> 03:14:27,790
And so I ran to my room.

4017
03:14:27,870 --> 03:14:28,870
And I put my stuff away.

4018
03:14:28,990 --> 03:14:30,130
And then I ran to the maid cafe.

4019
03:14:32,010 --> 03:14:32,890
And um...

4020
03:14:33,710 --> 03:14:34,150
And...

4021
03:14:35,530 --> 03:14:37,170
When I opened up the door...

4022
03:14:37,170 --> 03:14:38,490
They were all lined up.

4023
03:14:38,570 --> 03:14:39,370
Even Matara!

4024
03:14:39,630 --> 03:14:41,110
She was lined up with the maids!

4025
03:14:41,230 --> 03:14:42,690
And they did the...

4026
03:14:42,690 --> 03:14:43,770
They welcomed me home.

4027
03:14:43,870 --> 03:14:45,190
And I was like...

4028
03:14:47,010 --> 03:14:47,890
It was...

4029
03:14:48,470 --> 03:14:50,050
It was a dream come true.

4030
03:14:51,550 --> 03:14:53,050
I was like...

4031
03:14:53,050 --> 03:14:53,790
Except Matara.

4032
03:14:53,990 --> 03:14:55,150
She kinda ruined it.

4033
03:14:55,310 --> 03:14:57,290
But I was like, oh my god, they're all lined up!

4034
03:14:57,450 --> 03:14:58,190
Oh my gosh!

4035
03:14:59,630 --> 03:15:00,170
So...

4036
03:15:02,970 --> 03:15:05,030
And something really silly...

4037
03:15:05,030 --> 03:15:06,730
I danced for the maids, even.

4038
03:15:07,350 --> 03:15:08,970
I danced a little bit.

4039
03:15:10,170 --> 03:15:13,930
Our group had the maid cafe time slot right before you were there.

4040
03:15:14,090 --> 03:15:14,130
Our group had the maid cafe time slot right before you were there.

4041
03:15:14,130 --> 03:15:14,630
Ah man!

4042
03:15:17,830 --> 03:15:19,110
Next time, maybe.

4043
03:15:19,470 --> 03:15:19,490
Next time, maybe.

4044
03:15:21,410 --> 03:15:22,210
But uh...

4045
03:15:22,210 --> 03:15:23,650
I danced for the maids...

4046
03:15:23,650 --> 03:15:24,370
And...

4047
03:15:25,290 --> 03:15:25,730
Um...

4048
03:15:25,730 --> 03:15:27,930
I taught them how to do some otage.

4049
03:15:28,730 --> 03:15:29,890
They were so cute!

4050
03:15:31,350 --> 03:15:31,790
And...

4051
03:15:31,790 --> 03:15:34,270
They served me a sandwich.

4052
03:15:34,310 --> 03:15:36,070
But they said that it was really nasty.

4053
03:15:36,630 --> 03:15:38,670
And I was like, no, I'll eat it anyway.

4054
03:15:39,410 --> 03:15:40,650
And it was really nasty.

4055
03:15:40,690 --> 03:15:41,590
I couldn't finish it.

4056
03:15:43,670 --> 03:15:44,970
They were like, um...

4057
03:15:44,970 --> 03:15:46,550
Should we get you something else?

4058
03:15:46,550 --> 03:15:47,630
Ojo-sama?

4059
03:15:47,750 --> 03:15:49,570
But I'm not used to being called ojo-sama.

4060
03:15:51,850 --> 03:15:54,090
I was like, no, I'll eat it for you guys!

4061
03:15:54,330 --> 03:15:54,930
And it was...

4062
03:15:54,930 --> 03:15:56,270
It was so bad!

4063
03:15:56,590 --> 03:15:57,990
It was so gross!

4064
03:16:01,510 --> 03:16:02,470
But um...

4065
03:16:02,470 --> 03:16:03,330
Yeah...

4066
03:16:03,330 --> 03:16:05,590
I said something silly there that...

4067
03:16:05,590 --> 03:16:07,370
It's only the maids.

4068
03:16:07,430 --> 03:16:08,930
The maids, no.

4069
03:16:12,390 --> 03:16:12,890
Oopsie.

4070
03:16:15,130 --> 03:16:16,150
We had made...

4071
03:16:17,550 --> 03:16:18,030
Yeah!

4072
03:16:18,710 --> 03:16:20,070
I got to meet her!

4073
03:16:20,810 --> 03:16:22,370
She was so cute!

4074
03:16:23,130 --> 03:16:24,230
Her cosplay was so...

4075
03:16:24,230 --> 03:16:25,930
Oh my gosh, I can't believe there were mint guys players.

4076
03:16:26,050 --> 03:16:28,450
I can't believe I got to see them.

4077
03:16:28,730 --> 03:16:30,050
It was so awesome.

4078
03:16:30,530 --> 03:16:31,470
Oh my gosh.

4079
03:16:32,150 --> 03:16:33,450
I can't believe it.

4080
03:16:34,310 --> 03:16:35,670
I can't believe it.

4081
03:16:36,850 --> 03:16:37,590
It's crazy.

4082
03:16:39,390 --> 03:16:39,870
Hmm...

4083
03:16:39,870 --> 03:16:41,190
What was wrong with the sandwich?

4084
03:16:41,430 --> 03:16:42,150
I don't know.

4085
03:16:42,310 --> 03:16:44,550
It was like a...

4086
03:16:44,550 --> 03:16:46,350
Gluten free option.

4087
03:16:46,950 --> 03:16:47,730
Or maybe...

4088
03:16:47,730 --> 03:16:49,090
Maybe their vegan option.

4089
03:16:49,270 --> 03:16:49,790
I'm not sure.

4090
03:16:50,270 --> 03:16:51,510
But there was like a...

4091
03:16:52,530 --> 03:16:54,910
A hummus and an avocado spread inside.

4092
03:16:55,050 --> 03:16:56,730
That just tasted so...

4093
03:16:57,590 --> 03:16:58,030
Awful.

4094
03:16:58,770 --> 03:16:59,770
Did you see the bunny?

4095
03:16:59,870 --> 03:17:02,590
I saw pictures of the bunny girl mint, but I never got to see her.

4096
03:17:03,290 --> 03:17:03,970
So sad.

4097
03:17:04,130 --> 03:17:05,250
I only got to see pictures.

4098
03:17:06,190 --> 03:17:06,910
So sad.

4099
03:17:08,210 --> 03:17:09,810
Here's some singles for the maids.

4100
03:17:10,950 --> 03:17:14,530
I've never been to a maid cafe, but I assume you throw money at them.

4101
03:17:14,550 --> 03:17:15,290
Like you do at the club.

4102
03:17:15,430 --> 03:17:16,390
You don't do that.

4103
03:17:16,630 --> 03:17:19,370
But at my maid cafe, you can...

4104
03:17:20,150 --> 03:17:21,610
Throw the money at me!

4105
03:17:28,030 --> 03:17:28,870
Okay, get out.

4106
03:17:31,450 --> 03:17:31,930
Um...

4107
03:17:33,010 --> 03:17:33,710
But yeah.

4108
03:17:34,250 --> 03:17:35,070
Throws quarters.

4109
03:17:35,290 --> 03:17:35,470
Ow!

4110
03:17:35,610 --> 03:17:36,030
Ow!

4111
03:17:36,450 --> 03:17:37,590
It's getting in my eye!

4112
03:17:38,070 --> 03:17:38,730
Oh god!

4113
03:17:44,540 --> 03:17:47,400
So awesome seeing mid-mid-sunny at the maid cafe.

4114
03:17:47,840 --> 03:17:49,220
It was so awesome seeing mid-mid-sunny at the maid cafe.

4115
03:17:49,240 --> 03:17:49,380
Thank you!

4116
03:17:49,380 --> 03:17:49,740
Fine!

4117
03:17:50,040 --> 03:17:50,480
What the hell?

4118
03:17:50,640 --> 03:17:51,320
Wait, what about me?

4119
03:17:53,960 --> 03:17:55,200
What about me, huh?

4120
03:17:55,880 --> 03:17:57,260
Thank you for the 10k!

4121
03:17:59,340 --> 03:18:00,760
Thank you for the 10k!

4122
03:18:01,160 --> 03:18:01,660
Okay.

4123
03:18:01,800 --> 03:18:02,440
Oh, oh.

4124
03:18:02,460 --> 03:18:03,020
Thank you guys!

4125
03:18:03,180 --> 03:18:03,980
Thank you, thank you!

4126
03:18:04,800 --> 03:18:05,580
The money.

4127
03:18:08,060 --> 03:18:09,820
Maids Sunny and Ruby were so cute.

4128
03:18:10,060 --> 03:18:10,340
Yeah!

4129
03:18:10,740 --> 03:18:12,360
They were so cute.

4130
03:18:12,660 --> 03:18:13,420
Here you go, pause.

4131
03:18:13,680 --> 03:18:14,120
Okay.

4132
03:18:15,880 --> 03:18:16,740
You guys...

4133
03:18:16,740 --> 03:18:18,240
You guys waited for this.

4134
03:18:19,240 --> 03:18:19,840
Oh my gosh.

4135
03:18:19,900 --> 03:18:20,720
Thank you guys!

4136
03:18:21,420 --> 03:18:22,180
Thank you!

4137
03:18:22,540 --> 03:18:23,500
Gonna head out now.

4138
03:18:23,580 --> 03:18:24,160
Fun streaming.

4139
03:18:24,280 --> 03:18:24,880
Thank you!

4140
03:18:24,920 --> 03:18:25,980
I'm also gonna head out.

4141
03:18:28,280 --> 03:18:29,720
I'm gonna head out too because...

4142
03:18:29,720 --> 03:18:31,020
I should get some rest.

4143
03:18:32,320 --> 03:18:34,280
But tomorrow we'll play Tetrio together.

4144
03:18:34,420 --> 03:18:36,160
So we'll all be able to play games together!

4145
03:18:37,560 --> 03:18:40,380
How many people can be in a Tetrio room at once?

4146
03:18:41,700 --> 03:18:42,100
How many people can be in a Tetrio room at once?

4147
03:18:42,100 --> 03:18:42,520
I don't know.

4148
03:18:42,720 --> 03:18:43,120
99?

4149
03:18:43,400 --> 03:18:43,640
100?

4150
03:18:45,680 --> 03:18:46,360
I'm not sure.

4151
03:18:46,360 --> 03:18:46,460
Let's do it.

4152
03:18:48,820 --> 03:18:49,340
Otomita!

4153
03:18:49,880 --> 03:18:52,040
Thank you guys for the warm welcome back!

4154
03:18:52,140 --> 03:18:53,240
I'm so happy to be home.

4155
03:18:54,080 --> 03:18:55,480
I'm so happy to be streaming.

4156
03:18:56,760 --> 03:19:01,740
And next time I go to Japan, I won't make the same mistake of getting the bad hotel.

4157
03:19:02,120 --> 03:19:05,020
And next time I go someplace, I'll stream.

4158
03:19:08,480 --> 03:19:09,000
Oh.

4159
03:19:09,980 --> 03:19:10,500
Oh!

4160
03:19:13,040 --> 03:19:14,600
I'll make sure of it.

4161
03:19:16,540 --> 03:19:17,420
Sorry for...

4162
03:19:17,420 --> 03:19:19,100
Sorry for being gone for so long.

4163
03:19:20,060 --> 03:19:22,120
And having nothing to show for it.

4164
03:19:23,340 --> 03:19:24,380
I'm so...

4165
03:19:26,760 --> 03:19:27,280
But...

4166
03:19:29,020 --> 03:19:29,540
Sorry.

4167
03:19:31,920 --> 03:19:33,040
That's all I can say.

4168
03:19:33,140 --> 03:19:33,940
I just feel so bad.

4169
03:19:35,120 --> 03:19:37,880
That I was gone and have nothing to show for it.

4170
03:19:37,900 --> 03:19:39,100
Except my cough.

4171
03:19:39,380 --> 03:19:40,440
Except my baby cough.

4172
03:19:43,980 --> 03:19:44,720
But yeah.

4173
03:19:46,580 --> 03:19:47,060
Otomita!

4174
03:19:47,060 --> 03:19:47,980
Thank you guys!

4175
03:19:48,180 --> 03:19:50,340
And enjoy the rest of your night and I'll see you tomorrow!

4176
03:19:51,600 --> 03:19:52,080
And...

4177
03:19:52,080 --> 03:19:52,320
Oh!

4178
03:19:53,740 --> 03:19:54,400
Hold on.

4179
03:19:56,260 --> 03:19:57,740
Since we have time.

4180
03:19:59,300 --> 03:20:00,260
We have time.

4181
03:20:00,300 --> 03:20:00,780
We have time.

4182
03:20:00,880 --> 03:20:01,380
We have time.

4183
03:20:02,020 --> 03:20:03,000
We have time.

4184
03:20:03,120 --> 03:20:03,800
We have time.

4185
03:20:03,900 --> 03:20:04,480
We have time.

4186
03:20:07,140 --> 03:20:07,620
Wait.

4187
03:20:07,840 --> 03:20:08,340
Hold on.

4188
03:20:08,380 --> 03:20:09,160
Do I get an ad?

4189
03:20:12,340 --> 03:20:13,980
Do I get an ad?

4190
03:20:14,720 --> 03:20:15,160
Oh.

4191
03:20:15,180 --> 03:20:15,920
No I won't.

4192
03:20:19,770 --> 03:20:20,410
Yeah.

4193
03:20:36,400 --> 03:20:41,940
Yeah Let me tell you something.

4194
03:20:42,780 --> 03:20:46,400
If there's something weird sleeping in your bed.

4195
03:20:47,020 --> 03:20:47,360
Ow!

4196
03:20:47,680 --> 03:20:48,780
Let me tell you something.

4197
03:21:47,690 --> 03:21:49,850
I didn't cough as much as I thought I would this stream.

4198
03:21:50,550 --> 03:21:52,390
And I haven't even taken that much medicine today.

4199
03:21:52,390 --> 03:21:54,990
I think I'm feeling better!

4200
03:21:55,310 --> 03:21:56,430
I'm gonna test again tomorrow.

4201
03:21:56,950 --> 03:22:01,170
See how I'm... how I'm... how I'm progressing.

4202
03:22:02,370 --> 03:22:05,890
Feel good, feel good, feel good.

4203
03:22:09,350 --> 03:22:11,270
Freaky ghost maid!

4204
03:22:13,370 --> 03:22:15,530
Freaky ghost man!

4205
03:22:18,070 --> 03:22:19,590
Freaky man baby!

4206
03:22:22,390 --> 03:22:22,830
Ow!

4207
03:22:22,970 --> 03:22:23,310
Ow!

4208
03:22:23,470 --> 03:22:23,850
Ow!

4209
03:22:23,910 --> 03:22:25,890
What if my name wasn't made mint?

4210
03:22:26,070 --> 03:22:28,350
What if my name was freaky mint?

4211
03:22:31,770 --> 03:22:33,490
Let me tell you something.

4212
03:22:34,410 --> 03:22:36,210
Sleepin' makes me feel good!

4213
03:22:40,590 --> 03:22:42,230
I'm afraid of no sleep.

4214
03:22:42,690 --> 03:22:44,150
I'm afraid of no bed.

4215
03:22:48,550 --> 03:22:49,950
An invisible bed!

4216
03:22:51,530 --> 03:22:53,190
Freaky ghost bed!

4217
03:22:55,210 --> 03:22:56,950
Oh my bookmark is in there.

4218
03:22:58,550 --> 03:23:00,190
My face is a little crooked.

4219
03:23:00,390 --> 03:23:01,170
Don't worry about it.

4220
03:23:02,350 --> 03:23:03,430
Don't worry about it.

4221
03:23:03,510 --> 03:23:04,050
There we go.

4222
03:23:04,430 --> 03:23:06,590
Bustin', bustin' makes me feel good!

4223
03:23:06,890 --> 03:23:10,750
Feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good!

4224
03:23:11,470 --> 03:23:12,210
You know what?

4225
03:23:12,330 --> 03:23:14,150
If some artist is listening...

4226
03:23:14,150 --> 03:23:16,090
And if you're bored every one day...

4227
03:23:16,090 --> 03:23:17,530
If you ever wanna make me some...

4228
03:23:17,530 --> 03:23:20,930
Some new glasses that I can wear on stream...

4229
03:23:20,930 --> 03:23:23,650
That in one lens says like...

4230
03:23:23,650 --> 03:23:24,310
Freak...

4231
03:23:25,050 --> 03:23:25,770
Freak...

4232
03:23:27,410 --> 03:23:28,130
Freak...

4233
03:23:28,130 --> 03:23:28,190
Freak...

4234
03:23:28,190 --> 03:23:31,170
And the other glasses say...

4235
03:23:31,170 --> 03:23:31,790
Oh wait!

4236
03:23:32,530 --> 03:23:34,710
How can I say Freak Phantom?

4237
03:23:35,150 --> 03:23:36,690
Maybe in both lenses.

4238
03:23:38,290 --> 03:23:40,570
And the other one says nothing.

4239
03:23:44,170 --> 03:23:46,350
The other one says why.

4240
03:23:46,710 --> 03:23:47,270
Freaky!

4241
03:23:49,610 --> 03:23:50,970
Master Minto!

4242
03:23:52,070 --> 03:23:55,130
And then I can say, do you like my glasses?

4243
03:23:57,070 --> 03:23:59,810
Feel good, freaks and fans.

4244
03:24:03,230 --> 03:24:04,350
Feel good.

4245
03:24:04,490 --> 03:24:06,010
Good night, freaks and fans.

4246
03:24:06,850 --> 03:24:07,730
Thank you.

4247
03:24:08,430 --> 03:24:10,910
See you tomorrow.

4248
03:24:11,410 --> 03:24:12,090
Bye bye.

4249
03:24:12,270 --> 03:24:13,090
Thank you.
