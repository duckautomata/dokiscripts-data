1
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,270
My name is Mitvatov.

2
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,710
I'm really sweaty.

3
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,650
And I really love Metal Gear.

4
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,330
So listen to me sing Metal Gear songs.

5
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,170
Woohoo!

6
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:52,610
Petals of white cover fields flowing in grieving tears.

7
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:00,110
And all the hearts once new, old and shattered now.

8
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,570
Love can kill.

9
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,490
Will die give me wings to fly?

10
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:15,470
Fleeing this world so cold, I just wonder why.

11
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,950
Dramatic zoom.

12
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,270
Cold as the dark.

13
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,890
Now my words are frosted with every breath.

14
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,350
Still the hate burns while growing inside this heart.

15
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:50,130
When the wind changes course, when the stars align, I will
reach out to you and leave this soul behind when heavens

16
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,130
divide.

17
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,350
I don't know what else to say.

18
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,650
I'm really nervous.

19
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,130
Metal Gear?

20
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,030
Metal Gear.

21
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,350
I don't know.

22
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,450
I really thank you guys.

23
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,410
I hope you guys have been enjoying the karaoke relay so far.

24
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,890
Everybody sounded great And I hope you there's still lots of
people left.

25
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:30,790
So have lots of fun today When heavens divide I will see the
choices within my hands How can we ever protect and fight

26
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,350
with our tiny soul?

27
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:48,710
Let me shine like the sun through the doubts and fear Do you
feel the storm approach as the end draws near?

28
00:03:48,950 --> 00:04:06,970
When heavens divide, time will come to softly lay me down
Then I can see a face that I long to see And for you, only

29
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:22,170
you I would give anything Leaving a trace for love to find
no way When heavens divide

30
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,350
Yeah!

31
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:35,530
I'm gonna have to like speed route, speed, speed run through
these songs so much time to talk, but I'm a yapper.

32
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,090
Let's go.

33
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:45,070
I will dive into the fire, spilling the blood of my desire.

34
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:54,730
The very last time my name scorched into the sky.

35
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:03,350
When heaven's divide, I will see the choices within my
hands.

36
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:11,330
How can we ever protect and fight with our tiny souls?

37
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:26,090
Let me shine like the sun through the doubts and fear Do you
feel the storm approach as the end draws near?

38
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:44,470
When heavens divide, time will come to softly lay me down
then I would see a face that I long to see and for you only

39
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:58,730
you I would give anything leaving a trace for love to find a
way when heaven's divine

40
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:32,530
for love to find a way when heavens divide

41
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:46,250
yeah hold on I have to transition one second give me a
second give me a second oh my gosh wait all my stuff is all

42
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:53,210
over the place hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold
on oh my gosh go away Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on,

43
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:59,790
hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, okay, okay, okay.

44
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:09,030
I'm so nervous, oh my god, okay.

45
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:26,870
Blind in the deepest night, reaching out, grasping for
fleeting a memory all these thoughts keep piercing this

46
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:52,010
broken mind I fall but I'm still standing motionless far in
the distance there is light a light that burns these scars

47
00:07:52,010 --> 00:08:07,790
of old all this pain reminds me of what I am I'll live I'll
become all I need to be

48
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:36,170
Whoa Whoa

49
00:08:48,060 --> 00:09:09,860
Words that kill Would you speak them to me Your breath so
still, it makes me believe in the Father's sins.

50
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,920
Let me suffer now and never die.

51
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,020
I'm alive.

52
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,260
Except I'm not, I'm actually a ghost.

53
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,960
You know, it's so funny, you know, you're there.

54
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,600
I never die because I'm a ghost.

55
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,160
I mean, I'm already dead, but like, you know, it's like
undead, but not really undead because I'm not a zombie.

56
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,760
I'm not a ghost, but what does it, what do I really count as
in a, like, where do I fall under?

57
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,240
I'm having an existential crisis in the middle of this song.

58
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,780
Oh my gosh.

59
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,700
Anyway, okay.

60
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,100
Let's just keep going, right?

61
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:59,200
Pride feeds their blackened hearts, and the thirst must be
quenched to feel.

62
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:18,240
hypocrisy cleansing flames is the only way to repent
renounce what made you words that kill would you speak them

63
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:35,680
to me with your breath so still it makes me believe this
part is so hard Our sins never die Can't wash this blood off

64
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:56,700
our hands Let the world fear us all It's just means to an
end Our salvation lies Beyond the truth Let me suffer now

65
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:15,940
In my heart I just know that there's no way to light up the
dark in his eyes.

66
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,490
Whoa, whoa,

67
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:39,010
whoa, whoa,

68
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:45,670
whoa, whoa,

69
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:55,850
whoa, whoa.

70
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,210
Yeah!

71
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,010
The next song I've never sung before on stream, so I'm very
nervous about it.

72
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,050
Oh, okay.

73
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,710
I'm nervous about all these, but anyway, I'm gonna try and
sync it to the best ability that I can.

74
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,030
Here we go.

75
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,430
Oh, where's my song?

76
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:23,830
There it is.

77
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,590
I love you.

78
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,610
But it will never happen.

79
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,650
This feeling is so sad.

80
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,550
It's so sad.

81
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,180
The beginning, I don't know.

82
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,840
My name is normal, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

83
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,300
But when I'm out there, I'm sure I'll find you.

84
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,880
I'll be able to find you.

85
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,260
I'll be honest with you, I'll be able to see you.

86
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:22,590
love love listen to my heart more than love

87
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,480
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is all
about you.

88
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:15,520
No, no, no, no, no, no.

89
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,640
No, no, no, no.

90
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,380
This is the world that will change the world.

91
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,180
On the other class, we are now together.

92
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,060
God gave us a chance, you know.

93
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,360
Time is just going to go.

94
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,040
I'm sure this will be the same.

95
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,160
You'll be in love with each other.

96
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,840
I'll be the same.

97
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,500
You'll be right now.

98
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,380
You'll be right back.

99
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:46,700
You'll be right.

100
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:54,880
This moment will probably be somehow, will be, will be.

101
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,600
What will be your feelings?

102
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,800
Are you too sweet?

103
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,100
How much are you?

104
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:21,390
Okay, one more song, one more song left, and then I'll
transfer you over to the next person.

105
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:28,410
If you don't know anything about Metal Gear, I hope that you
still enjoyed the songs and everything.

106
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,610
It's a great series, I really promise you.

107
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,890
the good word of metal gear right anyway my last song may be
a song that maybe even if you don't know metal gear you

108
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:49,310
might know this one because it is um it is the metal gear
song perhaps um but yeah my final song and then i'll pass

109
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:57,590
you over thank you guys for listening and uh oh my gosh hold
on let me get it up let me get it ready

110
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:36,630
With darkness and silence through the night What a thrill
I'm searching and I'll melt into you What a fear in my heart

111
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,950
But you're so supreme

112
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:52,090
I give my life, not for honor, but for you.

113
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,370
Psych it out.

114
00:18:54,290 --> 00:19:01,070
In my time, there'll be no one else.

115
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,730
It's the way I fly to you.

116
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:38,150
I'm still in a dream, snaking up And someday you go through
the rain And someday you feed on a tree frog This ordeal,

117
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:55,630
the trial to survive The day we see new light I give my life
Not for honor, but for you

118
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:07,370
In my time There'll be no one else Oh my gosh, my voice is
cracking

119
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:16,150
Crime is the way I fly to

120
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:28,210
I'm still in a dream, snake eater.

121
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,000
