00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,720

00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,300
La creature.

Coughing up ectoplasm.

00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,140
There's also a drive-through, but we don't have a car.

269
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,820
Unless there is a car there.

I think we should, I think we should, I think we should
steal it.

Initializing world.

386
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,810
You're in the void.

387
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,590
Oh, wait.

388
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,730

00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,370
Sorry, there was a guy over there that scared me.

393
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,370
Look at him.

394
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,970
Wait, can you see him?

395
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,230
That.

396
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,850
That guy scared me.

397
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,310
I thought it was real.

398
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:13,650
Welcome to Arsenal Gear!

399
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:15,470
Yippee!

400
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,050
It's the big shell!

401
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:27,030
Yes, we're here in the big shell and we're gonna go
searching for bombs and whatever else is in here.

402
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,090
Whatever else our hearts desire.

403
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,470
I'm gonna have it not look at me.

404
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,450
I'm gonna turn you guys around.

405
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,290
You'll see him?

406
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,870
That's what I turned and looked at.

407
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,950
That's what I turned and saw.

408
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,190
I was like, I thought that was a real person.

409
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,110
But look how cool it is.

410
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,170
Welcome to Metal Gear, everybody.

411
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:53,090
You can access Arsenal Gear through Shell 1 Core B2 hostage
room.

412
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:54,470

00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,190
All right.

415
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,010
I guess I can walk through this.

416
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,070
No, I cannot.

417
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,250
I think I can jump up this.

418
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,350
No, I cannot.

419
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:08,950
Wait, how do I get around?

420
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,270
Huh?

421
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:15,550
Huh?

422
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:16,890

423
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:19,850
Huh?

424
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,490
The vent?

425
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,750
It's already gonna actually make me crawl!

426
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:32,510
Here.

427
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,010
Here I go.

428
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:36,830
Whoa!

429
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,650
Oh, I'm too big!

430
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,310

431
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:39,890
Hold on.

432
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,870
Save EE this time.

433
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,670
Okay, don't look at my skirt though.

434
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,010
Don't look at my skirt.

435
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,430
Wait.

436
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,890
Don't, don't look, don't do it, stop!

437
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,530
Okay, hold on.

438
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,670
I have to lay down.

439
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,590

440
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,450

441
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,910

00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:04,810

443
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:05,770

Um, we're looking away.

446
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,610
I don't want to crawl.

447
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,490
Is there a way to crawl?

448
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,290

I'm trying to read it, but my chat is right here, and the,
the, so it's kind of like, oh, more death triggers, respawn

534
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,960
if you get stuck, teleport system, and mirrors, I guess.

535
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,060
For some reason, people in VR chat, they, I can't look at
you unless I turn around.

536
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,260
They love mirrors.

537
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:03,360
I don't know why, but like, I've been told by people that do
a lot of the air chat that sometimes people will just sit in

538
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:19,420
a room for hours and just look at themselves in the mirror

give me some cool shades, but no pressure, you know.

620
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,840
But anyway, last night I messaged Scufford.

621
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:24,100
I was just like, hey, is it possible that I could use this
model in VRChat for my stream?

622
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,120
I saw that you made it, and it's so cute!

623
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,320
And they were like, yeah!

624
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,280
And then...

625
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,480
Oh, that made a headset.

626
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,680
And then...

627
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,140
they uploaded it for me i was so happy it was so nice
because otherwise i would have had to redownload unity and

628
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:50,940
do all that funny stuff but um but uh they were like oh well
i'll upload it for you and then you can um just grab it from

629
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:57,480
my private world and i was like cool and i joined let me
show you how i looked oh don't look at me let me show you

630
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,100
how i looked oh did you hear that since I didn't have an
avatar

631
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:16,920
this is the only one I could find well not the only one but
this is maybe the best one I could find I'm a rat look at me

632
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:30,940
I'm a rat everybody but um because the model or the avatar I
think it's a little weird on VR chat even if you change of

633
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:44,660
an avatar to um public it doesn't show up publicly for
everybody immediately and so um and so when they when they

634
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:52,880
made it public i had to wait but i was like oh no i don't
want you to have to like wait not i don't because they would

635
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,740
have to invite me back to their private world i was like i
don't want you to have to be like oh i'm busy i can't invite

636
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:04,620
you back to my private world right before my stream so I was
like you know what I'll do I will sit in your private world

637
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:25,060
all night I left a VR chat pin nice pin what are you talking
about hmm oh sorry I didn't mean to pin it sorry uh unpin

638
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:35,080
sorry I'm just clip clapping my hands everywhere sorry it
had your five seconds of fame okay i don't even know sorry

639
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,020
who who it was sorry

640
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:50,600
but anyway um so i stayed in i stayed in vr chat the whole
night and like just as this tiny little rat sitting in this

641
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:58,100
void world just next to the the thing that would allow me to
change into this into this avatar i thought it was really

642
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:06,140
silly because i woke up and and i was and i got on my
computer and i tested it out and i was just like oh i can

643
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:17,880
use the model now and um and yeah it was really silly so
anyway so that's why the controllers were dead no no no i

644
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:27,840
was on i was on i was on desktop my my vr stuff hadn't even
been hooked up yet so sorry that i pinned you and unpinned

645
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,980
you you probably were so excited you were like what does it
mean Why was I pinned?

646
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,940
And then I took it all away from you.

647
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,920
I wiped out your weird pin.

648
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,540
Anyway, let's keep going.

649
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,620

830
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:33,810
Not for you, at least.

Well, Fortune was here, right?

01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:49,910
I bet that's Fortune's smell.

893
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:52,590
But Fortune's making that smell.

894
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:57,170
Her pheromones for me.

01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:23,370
want to find where Emma gets shot, because it's one of my
favorite shots in the game.

01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:26,270
You need to, oh, you need to learn how to listen.

1056
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:28,830
Don't drop us.

1057
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:31,410
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1058
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:40,710
One second.

1059
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,380
Okay, let's go.

1060
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,640
Which way should I go, though?

1061
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:56,980
Actually, I don't remember.

1062
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,480
There's this one, and then there's that one.

1063
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,480
There's that one over there.

1064
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,660
And then there's also the lower levels.

1065
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:05,840
Oh, no way.

1066
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,180
I don't remember which way to go.

1067
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,780
The nerd is down there.

1068
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,120
Nothing here.

1069
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,800
But this is MGS fans' dream come true, for real.

1070
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:17,800
Love this for you.

1071
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,140
I know it's so fun!

1072
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,840
Oh my god, it's so awesome.

1073
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,780
I don't remember this particular building.

1074
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,900
I don't remember which way it gets us to Emma.

1075
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:36,540
This is, uh...

1076
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,560
Level 1.

1077
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:41,500
I can't read.

1078
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,040
What's this one?

1079
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:46,920
You're an expert, Minto.

1080
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:49,140
I'm not an expert with...

1081
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:50,320
Oh, Shell 1 to 2!

1082
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:53,160
Wait, can we even get through here, or will it tell us no?

1083
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:12,120
yeah um i think this is where we get the cell phone i think
we have a bit of a problem actually now that i think about

1084
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:21,520
it there's areas all around here that look like where wait a
second i think actually over there that might be it hold on

1085
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,280
let me show you guys

1086
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:33,740
because it has the staircase or the ladder right there
right?

1087
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:34,920
Is that it?

1088
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:36,040
Maybe?

1089
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:40,020
That, sorry my sleeves are so big that right there, right?

1090
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:50,120
Pretty sure that's where we went down from and then they
cross through here, right?

1091
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:55,460
But at the same time, here if I show you the other side, it
looks the exact same.

1092
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,420
So I'm not quite sure anymore.

1093
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,280
Alright guys, I'm gonna have to jump.

1094
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:02,680
But I'm gonna make this jump without you, okay?

1095
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,000
I'll bring you over once it's safe.

1096
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:07,360
I'll bring you over once it's safe.

1097
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,120
Here, watch me from afar.

1098
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:23,140
You can do it.

1099
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,180
Alright, kid.

1100
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:28,300
I'll see you later.

1101
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:29,980
On the other side.

1102
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:34,740
Ah!

1103
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:35,800
We

1104
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,680
did it!

1105
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,000
What did you think that I didn't do it?

1106
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,040
Come on.

1107
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:07,200
Come on.

1108
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,640
What did you... Why did you... We did it.

1109
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,980
We did it.

1110
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:14,740
Come on.

1111
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,060
Come on.

1112
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,560
Come on.

1113
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:18,280
Come on.

1114
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:19,940
Alright.

1115
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,120
Now look at me.

1116
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,520
Don't look at me.

1117
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:25,380
I'll turn around.

1118
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,520
It's really smoky here, so we gotta be careful, okay?

1119
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,200
Wait, actually, how do I get over there?

1120
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:37,980
Oh, well then, I don't want to fall off.

1121
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:40,400
Okay, here we go.

1122
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:40,960
I got it.

1123
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,120
We're going to jump through here.

1124
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:43,880
Nice.

1125
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,120
Nice.

1126
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,860
Run, run, run.

1127
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:48,660
Oh, oh, oh, holy.

1128
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:53,640
They fell all through.

1129
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,440
Don't get peed on.

1130
01:20:58,960 --> 01:20:59,920
I think we're safe from...

1131
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:00,960
Do you guys...

1132
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:01,140
Wait.

1133
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:10,900
Can you see it up there the the ship there that's not that's
not the ship that Solidus not ship.

1134
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:16,200
Oh my gosh the the solidus doesn't use a plane though Or is
it the Harrier?

1135
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,940
I can't tell is it it is the Harrier?

1136
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,140
Yeah, it looks like the Harrier.

1137
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:36,260
Oh my god It's solidus is Harrier Wow I So cool.

1138
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,320
There's so many things in this game.

1139
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,560
I mean, in this recreation, I guess.

1140
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,360
Alright, we gotta jump down.

1141
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:45,860
Okay, very good.

1142
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,840
And then, I don't know if you guys...

1143
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,580
Oh, you can see it.

1144
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,760
Look, it says return to the teleport if you need to go back
up.

1145
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:54,000
Or if you want to go back up.

1146
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:54,960
But not us.

1147
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:58,000
I wonder if I drop from down there if we'll make it.

1148
01:22:01,970 --> 01:22:02,710
Do you think?

1149
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:05,910
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1150
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:07,230
Wait, how am I supposed to get over there?

1151
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:09,450
Oh, gosh.

1152
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:09,830
Oh, gosh.

1153
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:10,310
Oh, gosh.

1154
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:11,170

Okay.

1157
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:16,350
Oh, my God.

1159
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:17,910
We made it.

1160
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:18,430
We made it.

1161
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,730
You can get a better look of it from here, too.

1162
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:23,090

Okay, wait, I have a second.

1182
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,180
Or not a second.

I have a...

1184
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:51,640
I have an idea.

1185
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:59,180
What if, because you guys are the camera, I just walk
backwards and then you guys tell me what's in there.

1186
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:01,660
What is it?

1187
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:02,240
What do you see?

1188
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,200
What's in there?

1189
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:05,060
What's in there?

1190
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:05,740
Do you see anything?

darkness?

1193
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:12,860
It's a black hole?

1194
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:14,100
It's the void?

1195
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:17,900
I guess it's a good thing we can't go in there.

1196
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,160
If it's all just darkness.

1197
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,020
Oh, geez.

1198
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:25,960

I think I see fortune.

1204
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:45,400
Don't lie to me.

1205
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:46,260
Don't lie to me.

1206
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:47,200
Don't get my hopes up.

1207
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,360
Shell 2 core.

Also, you guys can't really see it.

1214
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,220
But the floors are so shiny.

1215
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:00,960
Wait.

01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:01,560

1229
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:10,690
I'm gonna have to drag her!

1230
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:23,310
Okay,

01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:31,290
Come on, Emma.

1233
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:32,570
Come on.

1234
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:33,190
Come on, Emma.

1235
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:34,210
Come on.

1236
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:44,180
Oh, my god, there is more.

1237
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,620
There's too many, Emma.

01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:57,000
Snake, please!

1241
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:58,020

01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:58,940

01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:01,910
Oh gosh, you guys.

1278
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:03,650

Okay, hold on.

1280
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:08,470

1282
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:14,410
Uh...

1283
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:17,170
We managed to avoid drowning!

1284
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:18,410

01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:29,510
Press the left stick down to des-

Oh, guys, I tried.

1303
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:46,580

01:30:54,970 --> 01:30:55,390
I was in there.

1308
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:56,090
You saw, right?

1309
01:30:57,050 --> 01:30:57,650
Okay, hold on.

Oh, man.

1315
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:14,230
Ghosts.

1316
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,790
Ghost just float, apparently.

1317
01:31:18,210 --> 01:31:19,510
I have to use my own arms?

1318
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:20,330
I do?

1319
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:26,740

disappointing though I thought for sure we would be able to

1322
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,900
go see the room where E is at.

1323
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,220
Wait, this way is more comfortable.

1324
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:06,200
Okay, let's go inside.

1325
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,620
I hope you guys don't mind just like seeing my back the
whole time.

1326
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:16,320
I figured it's kind of like we're on the journey together,
you know what I mean?

1327
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:21,600
You're just following behind me.

1328
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:22,540
Kind of deal, you know?

1329
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:26,340
Called drinks.

1330
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,840
I'm throwing my money in there.

1331
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:39,800
Okay, very good.

1332
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:41,600
It's fine.

1333
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:42,480
Okay, I'm glad.

1334
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,860
And then there's some security cameras in here.

1335
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,360
Or not.

1336
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:48,300
Never mind.

1337
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:49,720
Wow, now I'm a liar.

1338
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:52,040
So we bring her back through here.

1339
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,760
Conscious or unconscious.

1340
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,620
So this is where we came from.

1341
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,720
And then we were like...

1342
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:05,720
Then we were like, oh, wait, where do we go from here?

1343
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:08,960
All I remember is, is it down?

1344
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:10,100
No, it's not down there.

1345
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:15,240
How do we get to the...

1346
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,860
How do we get down there?

1347
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,120
How do we get down there?

1348
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,520
I only have 30 minutes left.

1349
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:26,760
What do I do?

1350
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:32,600
Where's Strut L?

1351
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:33,900
Gosh, I wish I had a map.

1352
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,240
The door that leads down to oil fence is left maybe.

1353
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,580
No, this is the one that uh...

1354
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:43,460
That went boop boop.

1355
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:45,260
Unless we can't get down there.

1356
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:46,460
See.

1357
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:47,960
Well, Strut on the right.

1358
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:49,460
Oh, you're right!

1359
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:50,840
Right here.

1360
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:56,090

01:33:56,970 --> 01:33:59,230

I almost fell in.

1386
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:41,760
I stare at the stars in the scars up above and think what am
I made of?

1387
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:45,460
Am I full of sorrow?

1388
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:47,420
Am I hurt?

1389
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:54,020
When paint all around, I feel with...

1390
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:54,600
AHHHHH!

1391
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:56,760
Right, what's wrong?

1392
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,500
Right, right, right!

01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:09,040
You guys are supposed to protect me!

1394
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:15,090

Okay, I got one more shot.

We can take it slow.

1446
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:50,920
We can take it slow.

1447
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:53,120
I'll show you the headphones that were on the other side and
everything.

1448
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:57,500
Right.

1449
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:58,280

It's harder, it's, it's, it's harder than it looks, okay?

1454
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:17,200
Takes more balance than you'd realize.

01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:20,740
Okay.

1456
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:24,940
And then you come around here, and it's just the vast, vast
ocean.

1457
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:27,680
It's just all ocean.

1458
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:29,520
It's nothing much else.

1459
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:30,960
But I love the ocean.

1460
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:32,820

01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:00,880
It's so relaxing.

1524
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:01,980
Any vamp Easter eggs?

1525
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:02,960
I don't think so.

1526
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:03,920
I don't see anything.

1527
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:05,460
There's not even blood here.

1528
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:07,120
It's not even blood.

1529
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:11,120
I think actually she dies down a little bit, like...

1530
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:11,660
Oh, sorry.

1531
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:13,600
I can't grab you.

1532
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:15,300
Oh, come on.

1533
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:17,760
Come on.

1534
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:20,220
I kept trying to grab you, but I can't for some reason.

1535
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:21,360
Well, there we go.

1536
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:23,780
I think actually she dies right before it, right?

1537
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:25,080
But, um...

1538
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:25,840
Like right here.

1539
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,020
But there's still no blood or anything.

1540
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,120
I say die.

1541
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:36,300
I mean get stabbed.

1542
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,500
When she gets attacked.

1543
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:51,360
So that means the next location should be where she actually
dies.

1544
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:52,400
Right?

1545
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:53,940
What time is it?

1546
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:55,100
Oh, I have 10 minutes!

1547
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:56,640

And here.

1553
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:13,680
Oh, there's the Zone of the Enders boxes.

1554
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:18,210

1555
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:21,070
Oh, this is where the boxes are.

1556
01:47:21,290 --> 01:47:21,690
Just kidding.

1557
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:23,590
Actually, I have no idea where we are now.

1558
01:47:33,110 --> 01:47:34,770
Can I get up there?

1559
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:35,030
