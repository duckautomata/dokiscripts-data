1
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,750
Is there music?

2
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,230
I don't think so.

3
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,750
Sorry if you can hear, um, my computer.

4
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,970
Oh my god.

5
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,430
It's so loud.

6
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,350
Actually, can it- oh.

7
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,030
Okay, it is capturing on OBS.

8
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,350
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

9
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,790
Ghouls and Goyles.

10
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:12,630
Welcome to the maid cafe and girlfriend rental location.

11
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,890
Welcome to the maid cafe and girlfriend location.

12
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,550
This is all that I could rent out on such last minute notice.

13
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,650
I am very sorry.

14
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,670
It's the 3D streaming.

15
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,410
It's not.

16
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,950
It's not.

17
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,130
It's VR chat.

18
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:39,830
It's different.

19
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:40,970
It's different.

20
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,970
If it's 3D stream, don't you think I would make like a bigger deal about it?

21
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:54,670
Also, um, for those who, uh, if you don't realize- if you didn't know, um, I had some issues with my- with my VR controllers.

22
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,990
They are currently plugged up right now.

23
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,110
So my limit- my movements are a little- my limits are limited.

24
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,910
My movements are limited.

25
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,330
Um, oh gosh.

26
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,190
And I have a...

27
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,090
I have, uh, what's the words?

28
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,610
A rental mint push-push!

29
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,690
I am insane!

30
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,210
No!

31
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,030
Oh my god.

32
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,870
Oh my god.

33
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,350
Oh my god, real.

34
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,230
I can't tell if I'm backwards or not.

35
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:27,550
Why?

36
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,650
Hold on.

37
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,430
Okay, maybe- is it backwards for you guys?

38
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:31,810
No.

39
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,430
Okay, good.

40
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,430
Okay, there's no music in here.

41
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,670
I don't think.

42
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,510
There's no music here.

43
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,650
So, uh, here I come, everybody.

44
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,710
To the stage!

45
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,250
The one!

46
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,610
The only!

47
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,550
Bird!

48
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,370
Bird!

49
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,790
Hey, guys.

50
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,430
I just flew in here and my- I'm sinking through the floor, apparently.

51
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,110
Oh gosh.

52
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,750
Uh, boy, are my arms tired.

53
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:09,900
Hello.

54
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,780
Um, yeah, I'm a little purple.

55
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,800
What about it, huh?

56
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,720
I'm a little purple.

57
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,540
And my arms aren't- are tired because my hands are like this because I'm a ghost!

58
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,880
Hello, welcome to, um, why am I sinking through the floor?

59
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,060
Oh god.

60
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,200
Oh no!

61
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,860
Oh god, now I'm sinking through- oh wait, those are my legs.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,680
You can see them.

63
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,500
I was thinking I was gonna do a bit where I was actually sinking through the floor, but...

64
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,740
You guys just completely ruined it.

65
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,500
You guys just completely...

66
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,620
Completely ruined it.

67
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,400
Why is this mic so low?

68
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,400
And huge!

69
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,620
Hello.

70
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,000
Um...

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,320
Oh my god, even I have to bend down.

72
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,080
Hello.

73
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,880
Welcome to the maid cafe and girlfriend rental.

74
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,640
You guys, I think I'm a little afraid of this place because, uh...

75
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,740
Let me show you.

76
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,120
Also, if you can hear- if you can hear...

77
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,740
VR chat noises, no you cannot.

78
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,640
Hold on.

79
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,400
Hello.

80
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,280
Hi.

81
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,620
Hello.

82
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,180
Gosh, I'm Bustin' already?

83
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,620
But that's okay!

84
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,320
Bustin' makes me feel good.

85
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,240
And you too.

86
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,260
Apparently.

87
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,160
Yeah!

88
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,200
Do you guys like the low-poly model?

89
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,200
I saw that Scuff Word made it, and I was like...

90
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,420
I wanna- I wanna use it.

91
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,040
It was- it's so cute, right?

92
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:47,600
Hold on.

93
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,380
Let me get out of- I'm pretty purple.

94
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:50,780
Oh.

95
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,660
I'm... pretty...

96
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,760
I'm pretty purple, though.

97
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,560
You can see...

98
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,320
Me in my dress.

99
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,260
Na-na-na-na-na-na.

100
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,420
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

101
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,620
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

102
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,860
And my legs.

103
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,660
My legs.

104
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,680
My... body.

105
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,340
And such.

106
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,680
Yes.

107
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,800
And my arms.

108
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,060
Are like this, cause I'm a ghost.

109
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,200
The kicks.

110
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,880
Sorry.

111
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,260
My...

112
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,740
It's- it's still attached to a cord.

113
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,300
Oh.

114
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,620
Ah!

115
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,840
Guys, let me show you why I think I'm afraid of this place.

116
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,020
Where are you?

117
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,200
Oh.

118
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,680
Hold on.

119
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,380
One second.

120
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:41,880
Okay.

121
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,820
One second.

122
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,180
Okay.

123
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,080
Can I show you guys?

124
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,620
I'm turning you around.

125
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,610
Sorry for my shaky hands.

126
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,710
Look at this beautiful...

127
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:56,890
Place.

128
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,170
Look at- wow.

129
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,090
I don't think this is a maid cafe.

130
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,970
First of all.

131
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,690
But the paw print...

132
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,250
The paw print...

133
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,830
Seats are very cute.

134
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,870
I do like those.

135
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,070
Let us...

136
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,150
Let me show you...

137
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,190
The reason I'm afraid of this place, I think.

138
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,250
So, um...

139
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,550
Na-na-na.

140
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,090
There's a bar.

141
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,370
They have some snacks.

142
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,970
I can't read that.

143
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,150
But let me show you why.

144
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,390
Oh, sorry.

145
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,150
Sorry.

146
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:31,850
I'm struggling to leave.

147
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,050
Oh my God.

148
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,350
No.

149
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:33,590
No.

150
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:33,770
No.

151
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:33,930
No.

152
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,010
lalalalalalalala.

153
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,430
lalalalalalalalalalala.

154
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,810
I don't know if it's copyright and- So, why are there these rooms?

155
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,150
Rooms suite one.

156
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,130
Rooms suite two.

157
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,450
And rooms suite three.

158
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:47,910
It's not like...

159
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,550
It's a suite.

160
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,470
But like a...

161
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,850
Like a...

162
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,690
Like a...

163
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,390
Oh.

164
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:52,830
It's suite.

165
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,930
Amai.

166
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:54,630
Oishii.

167
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,010
But...

168
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,990
Okay.

169
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,710
Let's go to the room suite one together.

170
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,570
Okay.

171
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,390
Okay.

172
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,130
Well, thank you.

173
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,530
I can't read it though right now.

174
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,340
This looks no good.

175
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,180
This looks no good.

176
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,520
Why would you need a bed in a maid cafe?

177
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,700
This... this is so bad.

178
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,780
What is going on here?

179
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,780
You get tired?

180
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,580
No!

181
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:44,860
No!

182
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,280
To rest?

183
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,860
In a maid cafe, there's only energy!

184
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,520
There's only energy!

185
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,120
There's only moe moe energy coming at you!

186
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,800
There should be no resting!

187
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,000
Snake, it's a furry room.

188
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,080
What are you talking about?

189
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,220
I'm going to explore.

190
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,920
I'm going... I'm going... I'm going... I'm going in.

191
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,860
The pictures on the walls make me even more scared!

192
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,200
What is going on in this picture?

193
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,360
And then... and then... and then... over there!

194
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,700
That one too!

195
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,160
Why are they kissing?

196
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,320
Does the room smell funny?

197
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,570
Yes.

198
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,820
Let's go to another place, okay?

199
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,300
I think this place is kind of scary.

200
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,520
Where should we go?

201
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,540
The world is our oyster.

202
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,340
We can... we can go to McDonald's!

203
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,680
It's trending right now.

204
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,100
Let's go to McDonald's, everybody.

205
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,520
Alright.

206
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,000
Alright.

207
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's go.

208
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:18,780
McDonald's.

209
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,720
Here we go!

210
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,360
Whoa...

211
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,500
Whoa...

212
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,500
Whoa...

213
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:27,540
Whoa...

214
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,880
Okay, luckily it loaded pretty quickly.

215
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,900
I'm kind of scared.

216
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,960
Oh, gosh.

217
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,680
What are we going to see?

218
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,800
What do you guys see right now?

219
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,160
Oh, you guys see McDonald's.

220
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,800
I don't see anything.

221
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,800
Oh, we're here!

222
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:41,940
We're here!

223
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,300
We're here!

224
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,900
Where are you guys?

225
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,560
Hello?

226
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,520
Oh.

227
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,860
There you are.

228
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,700
Hello.

229
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,740
Oh.

230
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,800
There we go.

231
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,060
Okay.

232
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,140
Wow!

233
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,780
This actually looks so nice.

234
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,040
Looks like a real McDonald's.

235
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,060
There's even like a sign up there.

236
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,600
Can't really see it.

237
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,880
Up there.

238
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,040
It's like, serving smiles from the year 3000.

239
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,400
That's a little cool.

240
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,240
Oh, sorry.

241
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,800
See?

242
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,460
Take a picture of me in front of McDonald's sign!

243
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,030
What am I doing?

244
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:42,610
Okay.

245
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,160
La la.

246
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,820
La la la.

247
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,680
La la la.

248
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,220
In front of the McDonald's.

249
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,820
Whoa.

250
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,340
In front of the McDonald's.

251
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,940
In front of the McDonald's.

252
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,920
In front of the McDonald's.

253
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,820
McDonald's.

254
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,440
In front of the McDonald's.

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,560
Nice.

256
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,520
Um.

257
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,720
Minto cute.

258
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,220
Shut the hell up.

259
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,540
What's that over there?

260
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,380
GNC.

261
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,500
Verizon.

262
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,680
Subway.

263
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,640
GameStop?!

264
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,560
And there's a Best Buy right there!

265
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,260
This is the most real American I've ever...

266
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,340
Wait, is that an Olive Garden?

267
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,500
Why is there a...

268
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,700
Why is there a McDonald's when we can go to Olive...

269
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,520
Oh, there's Best Buy.

270
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,200
Olive Garden instead!

271
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,840
Let's go.

272
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,260
Endless breadsticks.

273
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,040
Endless breadsticks.

274
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,420
Endless breadsticks.

275
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,080
Endless breadsticks.

276
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,460
Endless breadsticks.

277
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,640
This is real America simulator I think, actually.

278
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,740
Whoa!

279
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,520
Italian kitchen!

280
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,260
Woo!

281
00:13:59,460 --> 00:13:59,940
Woo!

282
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,060
Oh, come on.

283
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,800
Uh, excuse me.

284
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,820
Let me in.

285
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,900
Let me in to Olive Garden!

286
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,720
Please!

287
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,720
Please, I need to go!

288
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,040
Please, let me in to Olive Garden!

289
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,180
Let me...

290
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,160
Let me in!

291
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,980
Let me in, please.

292
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,960
Let me in.

293
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,580
Just let me in.

294
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,500
Please.

295
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,820
Oh, no.

296
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:34,360
Oh, I know this is probably a little late, but how's the audio and stuff?

297
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,040
Hopefully I'm not blowing your ears out.

298
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,960
Audio's good?

299
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,660
Is it thumbs up?

300
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,220
Audio's good?

301
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,320
Sorry that there's no BGM.

302
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,440
Maybe I should've...

303
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,400
Maybe I should've put my own BGM.

304
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,140
What happened to you?

305
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,920
I don't know!

306
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,140
I have no idea!

307
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
I couldn't tell you.

308
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,460
I couldn't tell you.

309
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,720
Okay.

310
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,300
Okay.

311
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,360
Let's turn you around.

312
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,820
Back to McDonald's, everybody.

313
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,320
Let's go inside McDonald's, see what they've got.

314
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,080
Can we go to Waffle House perchance?

315
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
But also, I wanna actually look at this.

316
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,760
What is that over yonder?

317
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh, we have a Walgreens?

318
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,060
Oh, it's a Starbucks!

319
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,660
Oh my goodness.

320
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,560
These are...

321
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,640
What?

322
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,660
With the McMirror.

323
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,200
Huh?

324
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,140
Oh!

325
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,280
Oh.

326
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:40,860
Oh.

327
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,120
Ah!

328
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,460
It's me looking at you, looking at...

329
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,520
Me looking at you, looking at...

330
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,980
This is a mirror.

331
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,640
This is not me.

332
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,000
This is a mirror.

333
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,260
The McMirror.

334
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,340
So funny.

335
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,280
Okay.

336
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,660
Can I...

337
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,260
Can I...

338
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,580
Can I...

339
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:03,680
Oh!

340
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up.

341
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,780
Oh, no, no, don't ride the McMirror without...

342
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,560
Oh, shit.

343
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,320
Oh, God.

344
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,240
Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up.

345
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,300
Oh, no, no, no.

346
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,760
Oh, God, please, someone help me.

347
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,420
Get off.

348
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,400
Get off, please.

349
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,000
Oh, God, oh, God.

350
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,900
Please get me off of this thing!

351
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,940
How do I get off?

352
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,840
How do I get off?

353
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,760
I'm pressing everything!

354
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,000
Oh god.

355
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,070
Oh...

356
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,870
Don't ride.

357
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,250
Don't...

358
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,750
Don't ride it.

359
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,850
Where are you guys actually?

360
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,570
I don't even know where... where am I?

361
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,770
Oh, there you are.

362
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,850
Nice landing.

363
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,910
Gotta work those VR... I was like going...

364
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,610
I had no control over it.

365
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,430
What are these guys?

366
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:17,570
Oh, sorry.

367
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,110
These guys right here.

368
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,590
I can also sit on them.

369
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,290
Oh no!

370
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,430
Please, god!

371
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,990
Not again!

372
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,710
Oh, please!

373
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,790
Oh god, I can't stand!

374
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,550
I can't stand!

375
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,450
Oh god.

376
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,310
Oh...

377
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,970
Okay.

378
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,110
Okay, it stopped.

379
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,090
Okay.

380
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,830
I'm okay.

381
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,270
I can stand up.

382
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:44,610
Hold on.

383
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,310
How do I get off it?

384
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,610
Get me off, please!

385
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,450
Why can't I leave?

386
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,010
Oh...

387
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,200
Oh...

388
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,060
Scary, scary place.

389
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,740
Get rotated.

390
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,980
There's also a slide.

391
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,700
I wonder if...

392
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,820
Try the yellow one.

393
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,680
Okay.

394
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,700
Wait, is it different?

395
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,640
Is it different?

396
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,880
The different kinds?

397
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,680
That's red.

398
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,580
No!

399
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,900
No, no, no, no, no!

400
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,020
Okay, it's not any different.

401
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,740
It's not any different.

402
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,760
I'm gonna do the slide though.

403
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,760
Will you guys watch me?

404
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,940
Watch me do the slide.

405
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,280
Okay.

406
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,660
I'm gonna put it kind of far so you can see the whole process.

407
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,140
Okay?

408
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,380
Okay.

409
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,160
Actually, I'm just gonna have it look at me.

410
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh!

411
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,800
Oh my god.

412
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,480
Okay.

413
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,720
Watch me!

414
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,400
Watch me, mom!

415
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,520
Watch me go on the slide!

416
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
I gotta go on the slide.

417
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,320
Okay, mom?

418
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,540
Watch me go on the slide!

419
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,730
How do I get up?

420
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,430
Okay.

421
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,850
Can you see me?

422
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,650
Wait, you can't see me.

423
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,650
Hi, mom!

424
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,070
Hi, mom!

425
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,350
Here we go.

426
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,070
Oh, it says to sit on it.

427
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:20,390
Okay.

428
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:26,970
Wee!

429
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:33,960
Wee!

430
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,160
Wee!

431
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,380
Wee!

432
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:37,940
Wee!

433
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,680
Wee!

434
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,720
Wee!

435
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,520
Wee!

436
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,400
Wee!

437
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,020
Did you see me, mom?

438
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,260
Did you...

439
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,520
Did you see me?

440
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,580
Did you see me go on the...

441
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,840
Okay, hold on.

442
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,900
Did you see me go on the...

443
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,340
Go on the slide?

444
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,820
Right?

445
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,300
Oh!

446
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,840
Oh!

447
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,040
Yep.

448
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,020
Yep.

449
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,120
Gosh.

450
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,720
This is the place for kids to go.

451
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,520
This is the number one children's activity.

452
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,300
La criatura.

453
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,460
She's coughing up blood.

454
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,500
Nah.

455
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,240
I'm okay.

456
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,180
Coughing up ectoplasm.

457
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,540
Maybe a little bit.

458
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,560
Okay.

459
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,740
I'm okay.

460
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,940
There's also a drive-thru, but we don't have a car.

461
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,640
Unless there is a car there.

462
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,580
I think we should...

463
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,580
I think we should...

464
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,960
I think we should steal it.

465
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,700
I think we should steal the car.

466
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,460
Alright.

467
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,120
Follow me.

468
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,820
Follow me.

469
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,740
Oh.

470
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,020
Oh.

471
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,420
Oh.

472
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,360
Where is it?

473
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:52,660
There it is.

474
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,560
Oh.

475
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,040
No.

476
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,880
I'm going the wrong way.

477
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,360
Sorry.

478
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,720
I'm looking through what you guys are seeing.

479
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,180
Okay.

480
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,580
Here we go.

481
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,150
Alright.

482
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,170
I'm gonna pretend...

483
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,230
I'm gonna pretend I like...

484
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,050
Broke my foot.

485
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:07,410
Okay.

486
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,370
And you're just gonna...

487
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:08,870
And then...

488
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,210
When they get out of the car to help me...

489
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,010
You...

490
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,170
You get in.

491
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,110
You get in.

492
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,350
Okay?

493
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,670
As soon as I'm just like...

494
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,270
Oof.

495
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:17,930
Oof.

496
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,250
Oof.

497
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:18,470
Ouch.

498
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,190
Ouch.

499
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:19,770
My foot.

500
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,110
Okay?

501
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,570
I'm gonna make it really convincing.

502
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,170
Not like that.

503
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,430
Okay?

504
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,890
Like really, really...

505
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:24,130
Okay.

506
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:24,510
So...

507
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,270
You good?

508
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,230
You ready?

509
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,770
Don't chicken out on me, rookie.

510
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,830
Don't chicken out on me right now.

511
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,170
Are you good or are you good?

512
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,130
Come on.

513
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,450
That's what I thought.

514
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,050
And don't get distracted by the Best Buy either.

515
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:39,690
Okay?

516
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,470
Let's go.

517
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,110
Okay.

518
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,420
Let's go.

519
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,140
Let's go.

520
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,540
Excuse me.

521
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,040
Excuse me.

522
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,460
Excuse me.

523
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,840
Excuse me.

524
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,540
I think I...

525
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,640
Oh...

526
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,240
Oh God.

527
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,200
What's happening to me actually?

528
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,120
I think I broke my foot.

529
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,260
Oh God.

530
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,720
It hurts.

531
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,380
Oh God.

532
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,140
What's happening to me?

533
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,160
Wait.

534
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,360
I said I would make it convincing but not like this.

535
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,760
Oh God.

536
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,860
I think I broke my foot.

537
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,640
Oh God.

538
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,180
What's happening?

539
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,260
Oh...

540
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,980
Can you please help me?

541
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,080
That's your key.

542
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,040
That's your cue.

543
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,720
Help!

544
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,740
Help, please!

545
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,040
Help me, please!

546
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,080
I think I broke my foot!

547
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,500
Oh, my body!

548
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,520
Oh, my body!

549
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,520
Oh, my body!

550
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,600
I think I broke my body!

551
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,900
Oh, what's happening?

552
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,780
Oh, god!

553
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,360
Oh, god!

554
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:39,940
Oh, god!

555
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,060
Oh, please, please!

556
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,760
Please, oh, please help me!

557
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,580
Get out the car!

558
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,740
That's your cue.

559
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,080
Please!

560
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,120
Please let me in!

561
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,460
Please help me!

562
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,320
Take me to a hospital!

563
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,980
I need to use your car!

564
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,720
Please!

565
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,360
I can't pay for the hospital!

566
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Give me your four digits!

567
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,340
Give me your car digits and the three numbers on the back, please!

568
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,160
What are we supposed to do again?

569
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,900
You're supposed to get in the car.

570
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,220
Okay, you know what?

571
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,620
I'll do it.

572
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,610
It's undone!

573
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,210
Go, go, go!

574
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:22,910
Run!

575
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,430
Oh, my god!

576
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,710
It's the wrong type of vehicle!

577
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,400
I'm in this, I'm in this car, actually.

578
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:35,900
Wait.

579
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,760
How do I jump?

580
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,360
Oh, there we go.

581
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:48,860
No!

582
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,400
Hold on.

583
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,460
You guys are so far away.

584
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,280
Don't leave us to die!

585
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,760
Alright, come on.

586
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,260
You guys gotta use your, you guys gotta use your little leggies, okay?

587
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:57,980
Come on.

588
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,260
It's okay, we got another car.

589
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,880
We got one right here.

590
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,960
Oh, oh.

591
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,280
Oh, why am I still so shaky?

592
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,140
Are we okay?

593
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,680
Is everything okay?

594
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,800
I can't tell.

595
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,560
Futurama ship?

596
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,440
This one?

597
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,080
I don't know what it's gonna do to me, though, guys.

598
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,680
I'm kinda scared.

599
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,380
I don't know what it's gonna do to me.

600
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,280
Oh!

601
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,540
Woah!

602
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:39,780
Woah!

603
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,580
Oh my god.

604
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,600
Woah!

605
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,320
Woah!

606
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,640
Woah!

607
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,740
Wee!

608
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,200
Wee!

609
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,340
Ah!

610
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,600
Oh my god.

611
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,280
I'm scaffolding!

612
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,560
Oh my god.

613
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,980
We can go through the drive-thru now, everybody!

614
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,720
Woah!

615
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,920
I'm coming back!

616
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,580
Wait, something just happened.

617
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,460
Where did I go?

618
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:05,540
Oh!

619
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,760
Wait, I don't know.

620
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,520
What just happened?

621
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,220
What just happened?

622
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,100
Wait, where am I at?

623
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,420
I'm at Starbucks!

624
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,340
Wait, how did I get to Starbucks?

625
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,320
Wait, you cut.

626
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,060
Ah!

627
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:28,840
Um...

628
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:31,780
Sorry.

629
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,740
There were people there.

630
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,100
There were people there.

631
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,820
Is everybody okay?

632
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,900
I just jumped back home.

633
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,460
I jumped ship.

634
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,560
I jumped ship.

635
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,160
I didn't know what to do.

636
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,480
I just...

637
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,520
I just...

638
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:50,980
I just...

639
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,880
I'm sorry!

640
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,460
I'm sorry!

641
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,120
I didn't know what to do!

642
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,800
There were people there!

643
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,400
How am I supposed to talk?

644
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,240
Oh...

645
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,120
Everything's fine.

646
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,960
You know what?

647
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,180
We didn't even go inside.

648
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,820
We didn't even go inside to the McDonald's.

649
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,340
Oh man.

650
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:14,900
But...

651
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,380
But...

652
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,040
But...

653
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,280
But...

654
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,560
But...

655
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:18,620
But...

656
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:24,380
I have a place that I really, really, really wanted to go.

657
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,980
Is it okay?

658
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,540
Is it okay if I go?

659
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,820
Is it okay?

660
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,140
I saw this on...

661
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,200
I saw it on Twitter a couple months ago.

662
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,000
Maybe not even a couple months.

663
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,060
Maybe like a month ago...

664
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,700
And I was like...

665
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,300
That's...

666
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,000
When I do a VR chat stream, I must go there.

667
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,660
I must.

668
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:39,800
I must.

669
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,100
Oh my gosh, thank you guys for all the donuts too, thank you!

670
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,560
Super chats and memberships, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

671
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,760
It's kind of hard to read a little bit, so...

672
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,380
But let me see.

673
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,260
LapperStyle says it's your birthday on Friday!

674
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,000
Happy early birthday!

675
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,480
Unfortunately I can't go to Off-Kai, but can you bring me back some chaotic energy when you come back?

676
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,240
YES!

677
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,980
Well, I'll be going from the con to Japan, so it might take a while.

678
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,920
Probably.

679
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,080
You know?

680
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,100
So...

681
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:19,980
ShadowMoses?

682
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,120
Close.

683
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,600
Not quite.

684
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,440
Not quite.

685
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,320
Wait, hold on.

686
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:33,970
Not quite.

687
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,370
Not quite, ShadowMoses.

688
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:37,750
Not quite.

689
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,670
No, no, no.

690
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,870
And Jago, thank you for the...

691
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:42,290
And...

692
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,770
Gifted, thank you!

693
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,810
Thank you, thank you.

694
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,590
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

695
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,270
Okay.

696
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,510
We're gonna go.

697
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,570
And we're gonna explore...

698
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,370
Probably.

699
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,830
Alright, give me a second to pull it up.

700
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,930
I haven't...

701
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,390
I only looked around it a little bit.

702
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:00,570
Uh...

703
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,730
Can you hear me typing, by the way?

704
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,270
The ping-pong, ping-pong-pong?

705
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:05,910
Hmm...

706
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,550
Ah, here.

707
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,850
Here we are.

708
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:10,850
Hmm...

709
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,590
Let's go!

710
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,570
The rising world.

711
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,910
You're in the void, yeah.

712
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,470
Oh, wait.

713
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,010
Oh, there we go.

714
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,310
Okay.

715
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,150
Sorry, there's a guy over there that scared me.

716
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,110
Look at him.

717
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,670
Wait, can you see him?

718
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:05,930
That.

719
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,590
That guy scared me.

720
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,130
I thought it was real.

721
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,810
Welcome to...

722
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,230
Arsenal Gear!

723
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,450
Yippee!

724
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,810
It's the big shell!

725
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,770
Yes, we're here in the big shell.

726
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,810
We're gonna go searching for bombs and...

727
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,810
whatever else is in here.

728
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,630
Whatever else our hearts desire.

729
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,270
I'm gonna... have it not look at me.

730
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,090
I'm gonna turn you guys around.

731
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,010
Oh, see him?

732
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,830
That's what I turned and looked at.

733
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:38,770
That's what I turned and saw.

734
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,990
I was like, I thought that was a real person.

735
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,930
But look how cool it is!

736
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,830
Welcome to Metal Gear, everybody.

737
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:52,630
You can access Arsenal Gear through Shell 1 Core B2 Hostage Room.

738
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,330
Okay.

739
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,930
Yup, totally.

740
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:58,870
Alright.

741
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,830
I guess I can walk through this.

742
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,870
No, I cannot.

743
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,870
I think I can...

744
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,010
jump up this.

745
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,150
No, I cannot.

746
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,750
Wait, how do I get around?

747
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,090
Huh?

748
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:15,370
Huh?

749
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,730
How do I get through?

750
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:19,690
Huh?

751
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,270
The vent?

752
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,470
Is it really gonna actually make me crawl?

753
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:32,530
Here...

754
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,770
Here I go.

755
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:36,570
Whoa!

756
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,430
Oh, I'm too big!

757
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,190
I'm too big!

758
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:39,550
Hold on.

759
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,690
Save EE this time.

760
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,430
Okay, don't look at my skirt, though.

761
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:44,530
Don't...

762
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,930
Don't look at my skirt.

763
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:46,330
Okay.

764
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:46,830
Okay.

765
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,130
Okay.

766
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:47,510
Wait...

767
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,050
Don't...

768
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:49,950
Don't look...

769
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,050
Don't do it!

770
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:51,510
Stop!

771
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,070
Okay, hold on.

772
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,970
I have to lay down.

773
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,730
I think...

774
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,230
Is it working?

775
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,790
Oh, I can't fit!

776
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,430
I can't...

777
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,670
I can't fit.

778
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,490
You guys, I can't fit.

779
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,010
Um...

780
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,010
We're looking away.

781
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,150
I don't wanna crawl.

782
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,250
Is there a way to crawl?

783
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,090
Oh...

784
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:17,110
Okay.

785
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,630
I don't think this is correct.

786
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:22,570
Unless...

787
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,450
Can I get low enough?

788
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,110
Can I get down low enough?

789
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,150
Can I get down low enough to fit?

790
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,090
Come on!

791
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,510
Go, Mint!

792
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:29,810
Go!

793
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,510
Can you get down low?

794
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,710
How low can you go?

795
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:33,550
Two!

796
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,310
Two!

797
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,410
Thank you!

798
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,390
How low can you go?

799
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,970
Can you get down low?

800
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,110
Okay.

801
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,150
I don't think that worked.

802
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:45,810
Hmm...

803
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,110
There's a...

804
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,870
There's a floss thing.

805
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,190
There's a floss emote, but I kinda wanna try flossing first.

806
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:51,650
Okay.

807
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:52,750
This is...

808
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,510
This is me actually trying to floss.

809
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,010
And then this is the real floss.

810
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,350
Oh!

811
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:08,970
Wait!

812
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,150
Help me!

813
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,170
I can't stop!

814
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:14,910
Oh!

815
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,130
Oh my god!

816
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,600
That was the real floss, everybody!

817
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,580
How do I get past here?

818
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,520
I'm actually so confused.

819
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:28,820
Okay.

820
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:28,880
This is...

821
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,240
Let me try going in without you guys.

822
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,440
See?

823
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,620
This is what's happening to me.

824
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,580
Why can't I get through?

825
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,600
I don't care.

826
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:38,800
Eh?

827
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,440
Am I actually supposed to go through here?

828
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,880
Or...

829
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,140
Over...

830
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,360
Oh!

831
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,140
Wait!

832
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,280
Oh my god!

833
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:47,900
Oh!

834
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,160
I made it!

835
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,200
Can you see me?

836
00:32:59,330 --> 00:32:59,930
Hold on.

837
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,570
Why can't I go through the...

838
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:02,730
The...

839
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,490
The...

840
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:03,870
The...

841
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,950
Why can't I go through the sign?

842
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:11,990
Wait.

843
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,830
I think I'm stuck.

844
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,430
Wait.

845
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,350
I'm stuck, you guys!

846
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:17,810
Oh!

847
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,950
I was stuck in the middle of the air.

848
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,590
I'm gonna have it look at me actually.

849
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,210
So you can see what I'm doing.

850
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:27,910
Maybe.

851
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,650
I actually don't know if you'll be able to see me.

852
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,010
Okay.

853
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:31,350
Hold on.

854
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:33,870
Okay.

855
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,330
Hold on.

856
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:37,430
No.

857
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:37,650
No.

858
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:37,830
No.

859
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,590
Please.

860
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:39,450
No!

861
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,010
No!

862
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:40,530
No!

863
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,740
Wait.

864
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,560
Maybe if I jump here?

865
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,600
There we go.

866
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,060
Okay.

867
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,380
Okay.

868
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,520
Jump!

869
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,420
My oshi is illiterate.

870
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,610
Metal Gear Solid 2 Plants Chapter 1.

871
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,870
Respawn point is dynamic respawn.

872
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,870
3 times.

873
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:09,530
In a row.

874
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,410
To return here.

875
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,490
You can access Arsenal gear through a shell one.

876
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,990
Those settings in the next room interact to hide.

877
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,680
It's all your fault!

878
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,560
It's all your fault!

879
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,620
Okay.

880
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:56,940
Let's go.

881
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,080
Let's...

882
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,340
Ikimashou.

883
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,500
Hold on.

884
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,720
Oh!

885
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,420
Oh!

886
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,200
My bad.

887
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,460
Sorry.

888
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,340
I didn't mean to do that.

889
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,280
Alright.

890
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,080
Look at this!

891
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,120
Can they open?

892
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,840
They can!

893
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:22,920
Oh.

894
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,600
Wait.

895
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,540
Wait.

896
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:24,860
Hold on.

897
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,020
Oh my gosh.

898
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,360
Take a screenshot of me!

899
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,740
In the locker!

900
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,870
Can you see?

901
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,250
Oh.

902
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:37,890
Oh.

903
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:39,950
Oh.

904
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:40,630
Oh.

905
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:41,070
Oh.

906
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:41,870
Oh.

907
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:42,750
Oh.

908
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:42,910
Oh.

909
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,350
Oh.

910
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,630
Hi mom!

911
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,370
Must have been the wind.

912
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,290
How do I get out?

913
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,130
Wait.

914
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,310
Can...

915
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,530
If I jump, can you see my hand?

916
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:02,770
Oh.

917
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,290
You can't.

918
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,290
Ta-da!

919
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,130
Wait.

920
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,390
I'll do a different pose every time.

921
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:20,430
Ta-da!

922
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,370
Ta-da!

923
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,090
Ta-da!

924
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:22,830
Ta-dum!

925
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,930
Ta-dum...

926
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,590
How do I...

927
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,590
Wait.

928
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,350
Hold on.

929
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,180
Let's go, silly!

930
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:40,800
Come on.

931
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,080
Let's keep going.

932
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,160
We got to...

933
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,820
Get the nerd?

934
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,880
Beep-boop-bop!

935
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,880
La la la!

936
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,320
Beep-boop-bop!

937
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,860
La la la!

938
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,820
How do you do?

939
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,160
Hacking, hacking, hacking, did you just say nerd?

940
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,540
Hacking, hacking, hacking, did you just say nerd?

941
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,240
Let's go.

942
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,520
Let's go.

943
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,040
Where's this?

944
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,900
Oh, I think I turned the world sound off.

945
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,820
There we go.

946
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,220
Oh my god, there's actually ambience, thank goodness.

947
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,320
Wait.

948
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,180
I'm gonna fix the camera just a little bit.

949
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:22,900
Um...

950
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,180
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have it just looking at me the whole time.

951
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:27,880
Sorry.

952
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,940
It's been a long time since I've used a VR chat, so...

953
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,000
It's uh...

954
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,800
Hayden!

955
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,540
Thank you for the vibe, give the thank you!

956
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Uh, one second.

957
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,420
Kinda want it like over my shoulder, right?

958
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,580
So that we can walk through this together.

959
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,100
So you can take my hand.

960
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,260
Just kidding, you can't grab it.

961
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:48,940
I'm a ghost!

962
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,600
Okay.

963
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,060
This way.

964
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,980
Here we go.

965
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,560
Whoa!

966
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,120
Oh, this is a work in progress.

967
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,360
April 4th, 2024.

968
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,840
This is what it says here.

969
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,420
So that, remember when I said I saw it pretty recently?

970
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,920
That's when I saw it.

971
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,780
Incorrect locker sound in B1 filtration chamber number 2.

972
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,920
Performance improvements try to reduce a ram by ram.

973
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,500
Some doors and warehouse have a wrong way door asset.

974
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,760
Improved world lighting.

975
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,000
Wow!

976
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,400
Fix seagulls flying.

977
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,940
Add sound to various areas.

978
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,740
Add more ciphers.

979
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,900
No, no, no, no.

980
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,920
I'm trying to read it, but my chat is right here.

981
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,960
And the...

982
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,240
So it's kind of like...

983
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,760
More death triggers.

984
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,140
Respawn if you get stuck.

985
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,580
Teleport system.

986
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,760
And mirrors, I guess.

987
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,040
For some reason, people in VR chat, they...

988
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,960
I can't look at you unless I turn around.

989
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,840
They love mirrors.

990
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,440
I don't know why.

991
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:04,720
But like, I've been told by people that do a lot of VR chat that sometimes people will just sit in a room for hours.

992
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,840
And just look at themselves in the mirror.

993
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,360
Isn't that kind of crazy?

994
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,780
Let's keep going.

995
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,640
Thank you!

996
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,260
Oh god.

997
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,880
Why did I do that?

998
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,420
Anyway.

999
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,480
Settings.

1000
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,440
Background music.

1001
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,520
Oh yeah, let's do that.

1002
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:27,580
Oh.

1003
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,960
I think it's just the ambience.

1004
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,540
Okay, nevermind.

1005
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,140
Particles.

1006
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,180
I don't see any.

1007
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,400
Or dance in front of them.

1008
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:37,840
Maybe.

1009
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,300
Real...

1010
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:42,880
Real...

1011
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,760
What does that say?

1012
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,780
What does this one say?

1013
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,160
Real...

1014
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,600
Hime.

1015
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,800
Real...

1016
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,960
Time lights.

1017
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,700
Just kidding.

1018
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,240
I don't need you.

1019
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,420
Let's keep going.

1020
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,400
The nerd!

1021
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,560
Now here's where we really nerded out.

1022
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,140
Okay, guys.

1023
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,160
I'm trying to get a good angle for you.

1024
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,150
Oh my god!

1025
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,310
Mom, I'm on the nerd!

1026
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,930
I'm on the nerd!

1027
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:14,290
Woohoo!

1028
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,110
Oh!

1029
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:15,330
Woah!

1030
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:15,690
Woah!

1031
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,090
Woah!

1032
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,850
Where did I go?

1033
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:17,610
Help me!

1034
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,030
Help!

1035
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,310
Help!

1036
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,530
Did she just say nerd?

1037
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,150
La la la la la.

1038
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,810
This is me spreading lies on the internet.

1039
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,210
Can I actually interact with it?

1040
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,270
No, it doesn't seem to be the case.

1041
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,150
Oh, no worries.

1042
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:39,530
Okay.

1043
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,470
Oh my gosh!

1044
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,230
We're gonna go upstairs!

1045
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,770
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited.

1046
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,610
Here we go.

1047
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,090
Here we go.

1048
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,430
Beep!

1049
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,650
Ah!

1050
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,050
Okay.

1051
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,230
Here we go!

1052
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:51,870
Here we go!

1053
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:54,990
Strut a roof.

1054
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,270
Oh, I see it.

1055
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:58,790
I see it.

1056
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,890
It says strut a roof, but it doesn't show it for you guys.

1057
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,010
That's kinda sad.

1058
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,010
It showed it just like how it looks in the game.

1059
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:04,850
Wow!

1060
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,110
It's beautiful!

1061
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:08,930
Turn around!

1062
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:09,390
Turn around!

1063
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,790
Turn around!

1064
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,450
Turn around!

1065
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,490
Look at that!

1066
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:12,770
Oh!

1067
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:13,590
Where did I go?

1068
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:13,870
Where did the sun go?

1069
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,310
Oh!

1070
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,130
Oh, I...

1071
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:16,710
You can see it.

1072
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,830
I can't see it though for some reason.

1073
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,270
Wow!

1074
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,510
Oh!

1075
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,150
Oopsie.

1076
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,790
I accidentally went back downstairs.

1077
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,130
Mother base?

1078
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,150
It really looks like a mother base, doesn't it?

1079
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,270
Hold on.

1080
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,390
My fault.

1081
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:29,890
Hold on.

1082
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,670
We gotta go back up.

1083
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,970
I didn't know it was an insta-teleport.

1084
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:38,170
Okay, here we go.

1085
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,550
We'll go around.

1086
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,150
Wow!

1087
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:43,570
We're back!

1088
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:43,770
Wow!

1089
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,430
Oh my gosh!

1090
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,490
It looks so beautiful!

1091
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,630
Big shell!

1092
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,130
Whoa!

1093
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,930
And the water and everything.

1094
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:53,430
Wow!

1095
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,030
There's even the bird poop!

1096
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,630
Wait, you guys can't see it.

1097
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:58,930
Hold on.

1098
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,210
Where are you?

1099
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:03,810
There you are.

1100
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,770
Look at the bird poop!

1101
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:07,910
Hold on.

1102
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,850
Oh, let me turn off auto-level.

1103
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:11,410
Oh!

1104
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:11,830
Oh!

1105
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:12,890
Oh!

1106
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:13,030
Oh!

1107
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,090
Oh!

1108
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,990
Get a picture of me with the bird poop!

1109
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,450
Tease.

1110
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:20,890
Tease.

1111
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,110
Tease.

1112
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,230
Tease.

1113
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:27,670
Ahem.

1114
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,090
Ah-ah-ahem.

1115
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,150
Moe.

1116
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:30,750
Moe.

1117
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:31,230
Kyong!

1118
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:33,870
Tease.

1119
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:35,070
Tease.

1120
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:36,870
Tease.

1121
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,530
Tease.

1122
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,830
Tease.

1123
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:39,110
Oh!

1124
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,670
I almost fell over.

1125
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:41,670
Tease.

1126
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,010
Tease.

1127
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,550
My apple.

1128
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,490
How does it do that?

1129
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,130
Wowee, quite a show, huh?

1130
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:02,370
Anyway.

1131
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,370
So beautiful.

1132
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:05,950
That's where Emma died.

1133
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,050
Well, that's not where Emma dies, but this is where Emma will die.

1134
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:12,350
Cool.

1135
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,870
Shall we continue onward?

1136
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,210
I can see stuff over there.

1137
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,830
Oh, there's some ciphers over there.

1138
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,390
And, oh wait, hold on.

1139
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,250
I forgot to do something.

1140
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,790
I forgot to do the most important thing.

1141
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,390
Gotta put you back a little bit, though.

1142
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,410
I forgot to Looney Tunes myself on the bird poop.

1143
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:33,790
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1144
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1145
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1146
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:49,930
Okay,

1147
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:53,870
that was good.

1148
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,570
That was a good one, wasn't it?

1149
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,150
That was a good one, wasn't it?

1150
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:04,510
Okay.

1151
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,870
How do I want you guys to follow me again?

1152
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,210
We'll just have you follow me.

1153
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:08,210
We'll just have you follow me.

1154
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,310
Let me follow my back again, okay?

1155
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,560
Alright, returning.

1156
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,280
We're going this way.

1157
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,800
There's more bird poop!

1158
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,940
There's more of it, right there!

1159
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,180
And there should be some more over here!

1160
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,960
More bird poop!

1161
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,800
Now let's get inside, but we can't crawl through there.

1162
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,600
The door is wide open for us for easy access.

1163
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,980
But can you guys see through here?

1164
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,080
You can see, like...

1165
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,440
You can see, like, the pipes over there.

1166
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,040
And stuff.

1167
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,540
It's so cool, right?

1168
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,820
This is how MGS4 should have ended?

1169
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,460
What do you mean?

1170
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,240
Can you skateboard around in VR?

1171
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,020
Scuff Word!

1172
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,240
Scuff Word!

1173
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,120
Scuff Word, if you're listening!

1174
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,320
Scuff Word!

1175
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,820
Oh my gosh, the funniest thing!

1176
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,420
Okay, hold on.

1177
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,860
So, when I was preparing for this stream, I asked Scuff Word.

1178
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,040
Scuff Word is the person that made the model.

1179
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,060
So, thank you, Scuff Word!

1180
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,500
Oh, you're here!

1181
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,640
I have been summoned!

1182
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,000
Scuff Word, if you want to put sunglasses.

1183
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,060
If you want to give me some cool shades.

1184
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,940
But no pressure, you know?

1185
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:14,940
But, anyway.

1186
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,800
Last night, I messaged Scuff Word.

1187
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,980
I was just like, Hey, is it possible that I could use this model in VRChat for my stream?

1188
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,720
I saw that you made it, and it's so cute!

1189
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,080
And they were like, yeah!

1190
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,180
And then...

1191
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,360
Oh, that made me headset.

1192
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,360
And then...

1193
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,040
They uploaded it for me.

1194
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:35,740
I was so happy.

1195
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,660
It was so nice.

1196
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:40,500
Because otherwise, I would have had to redownload Unity and do all that funny stuff.

1197
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,100
But...

1198
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:43,500
But...

1199
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,260
They were like, oh, I'll upload it for you.

1200
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,720
And then, you can just grab it from my private world.

1201
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,380
And I was like, cool!

1202
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,700
And I joined...

1203
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,860
Let me show you how I looked.

1204
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,020
Oh, don't look at me.

1205
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,880
Let me show you how I looked.

1206
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:58,200
Oh!

1207
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,060
Did you hear that?

1208
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,260
Since I didn't have an avatar...

1209
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,940
This is the only one I could find.

1210
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,840
Well, not the only one.

1211
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:09,860
But this is...

1212
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,780
Maybe the best one I could find.

1213
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,900
I'm a rat!

1214
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,320
Look at me!

1215
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,360
I'm a rat, everybody!

1216
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,580
But...

1217
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,100
Because...

1218
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,400
The model...

1219
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,840
Or the avatar...

1220
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,600
I think it's a little weird on VRChat.

1221
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,320
Even if you change an avatar to public...

1222
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,300
It doesn't show up publicly for everybody immediately.

1223
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:39,960
And so...

1224
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,140
And so...

1225
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,560
When they...

1226
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,600
When they made it public...

1227
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,660
I had to wait.

1228
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:47,820
But...

1229
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,260
I was like, oh no.

1230
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,920
I don't want you to have to like...

1231
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:51,980
Wait on...

1232
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:52,300
I don't want...

1233
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,280
Because they would have to invite me back to their private world.

1234
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,540
I was like, I don't want you to have to be like...

1235
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,080
Oh, I'm busy.

1236
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,620
I can't invite you back to my private world right before my stream.

1237
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,760
So I was like, you know what I'll do?

1238
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,300
I will sit in your private world.

1239
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,440
All night.

1240
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,660
I left VRChat.

1241
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,200
Pin?

1242
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,580
Nice pin.

1243
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,520
What are you talking about?

1244
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,480
Oh, sorry.

1245
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,600
I didn't mean to pin it.

1246
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,320
Sorry.

1247
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:24,820
Unpin.

1248
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:26,580
Sorry.

1249
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,720
I'm just clapping my hands everywhere.

1250
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,460
Sorry.

1251
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,580
You had your five seconds of fame.

1252
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:33,900
Okay.

1253
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,760
I don't even know.

1254
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,000
Sorry.

1255
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:35,920
Who it was.

1256
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:36,800
Sorry.

1257
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:44,640
But anyway, so I stayed in.

1258
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:56,600
I stayed in VRChat the whole night and like just as this tiny little rat sitting in this void world just next to the thing that would allow me to change into this avatar.

1259
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:03,780
I thought it was really silly because I woke up and I got on my computer and I tested it out.

1260
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,080
And I was just like, oh, hey, I can use the model now.

1261
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,000
And yeah, it was really silly.

1262
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:16,120
So anyway, so that's why the controllers were dead.

1263
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,120
No, no, no, no.

1264
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,300
I was on.

1265
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,260
I was on.

1266
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,100
I was on desktop.

1267
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,820
My VR stuff hadn't even been hooked up yet.

1268
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,960
So sorry that I pinned you and unpinned you.

1269
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,220
You probably were so excited.

1270
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,440
You were like, what does it mean?

1271
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,740
Why was I pinned?

1272
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,760
And then I took it all away from you.

1273
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,540
I wiped out your pin.

1274
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,320
Anyway, let's keep going.

1275
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,440
Wait, what time is it?

1276
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:43,720
Okay.

1277
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,260
I still have an hour before my meeting.

1278
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,980
My very real meeting.

1279
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,480
We're going to strut a pump room.

1280
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,760
The music!

1281
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,920
And oh, wait, these are not the Zone of the Enders boxes.

1282
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,160
Where are those ones?

1283
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,140
Oh, no, that's okay.

1284
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,740
Yes, I know where we are.

1285
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,800
There it is!

1286
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:12,540
Hold on.

1287
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:18,290
Hold on.

1288
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,910
I'm going to be really sneaky.

1289
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:22,290
Okay.

1290
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:24,290
Hold on.

1291
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,130
I'm going to crouch down a little bit.

1292
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:30,650
Here.

1293
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:31,470
Even look at me.

1294
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:31,970
Look at me.

1295
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:33,750
Except watch me be...

1296
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,270
Shh.

1297
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:35,250
Okay.

1298
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:36,450
Okay.

1299
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:36,530
Okay.

1300
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:45,550
I'm going to be sneaky.

1301
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,930
Why is my butt in the air like that?

1302
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:47,290
Wait.

1303
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:47,890
Don't look.

1304
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:50,810
I'm going to hack.

1305
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:54,430
But sneaky.

1306
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:55,550
Wait, can I sit here?

1307
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:56,330
No.

1308
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:02,870
I'm sneaky.

1309
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:04,630
I'm sneaking around.

1310
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,550
I'm glad that when I...

1311
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:14,190
Where are you?

1312
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:14,350
Where are you?

1313
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,070
Oh, you're looking.

1314
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:15,570
Here we go.

1315
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:22,930
When you guys saw my thumbnail, you were like, wow, it's very Bigfoot-esque.

1316
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,690
You guys got what I was going for.

1317
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:26,710
Nice.

1318
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:30,810
Let's keep going.

1319
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:32,970
This way.

1320
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,790
Oh, is the music okay for you guys?

1321
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,030
Do you want me to turn it up a little bit?

1322
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:40,210
What was that noise?

1323
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:40,890
What noise?

1324
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:41,970
Okay.

1325
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:44,950
We're going to go to the other side.

1326
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,350
Why is it so...

1327
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:51,050
This is not where we came from, but let's try it out.

1328
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:52,970
Strut a roof.

1329
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,090
I think it's just the other side.

1330
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,950
Yeah, it's just the other side.

1331
00:50:59,390 --> 00:50:59,790
Okay.

1332
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:00,130
Nevermind.

1333
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,530
It must have been the wind.

1334
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:07,490
Whoa.

1335
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:10,730
Let's go through here.

1336
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:14,470
Oh, this is where you crawl through the pipes and stuff to get out.

1337
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:14,990
Let's get to the bomb!

1338
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,600
What was that noise?

1339
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,220
Can I get in here?

1340
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,600
Uh oh, wait, I don't want to get stuck in here though.

1341
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,280
Uh oh, wait a minute.

1342
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,400
Was this a bad idea?

1343
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,000
Uh oh, you guys?

1344
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,520
Uh oh, wait a second.

1345
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,180
Wait a second, I think we might be stuck.

1346
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,560
Uh oh, wait a minute.

1347
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,240
Maybe through here?

1348
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,680
Uh oh.

1349
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,840
Uh oh.

1350
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,880
Uh oh, can I slip through here?

1351
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,320
Oh, I hear it!

1352
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,340
You see the bomb?

1353
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,960
Wait, is that the bomb?

1354
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,820
Or is that just a pole?

1355
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,360
I hear it though, do you guys hear it?

1356
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,160
You... you...

1357
00:51:59,160 --> 00:51:59,780
You...

1358
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,960
You guys, I'm stuck!

1359
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,540
I'm stuck in here!

1360
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:05,940
For real!

1361
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,400
Um...

1362
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,120
Uh... what do I do?

1363
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,000
Respawn.

1364
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,420
Oh, there we go!

1365
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,120
Nice!

1366
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,320
I want to see if we can get to it.

1367
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:25,800
Oop.

1368
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,420
Sorry if I'm going a little fast.

1369
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,420
Oh, nice!

1370
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,600
I actually don't remember where it's at.

1371
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,160
There it is!

1372
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,120
I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it!

1373
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:45,390
Ahem.

1374
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,090
Mint's back.

1375
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,490
Don't look!

1376
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,130
Okay.

1377
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,450
This is very serious business.

1378
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,070
I will defuse this bomb.

1379
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,750
I will defuse this bomb.

1380
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:42,410
Oh wait, what just happened?

1381
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:44,630
Oh wait, I changed my chat on accident, hold on.

1382
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,140
What just happened?

1383
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:50,760
I don't know.

1384
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,380
Thank you though.

1385
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:52,840
Whatever.

1386
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,340
I don't know why I'm saying thank you.

1387
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:00,840
Diffused!

1388
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,300
Good job!

1389
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,140
Okay.

1390
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,640
I don't know how to get out of here again.

1391
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,620
So, uh...

1392
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,120
You're gonna follow me!

1393
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,820
You're just gonna follow me!

1394
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,900
I'll take the lead, okay?

1395
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,200
Oh!

1396
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,200
Oh no!

1397
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,220
I almost had it!

1398
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,200
Okay, nice, nice.

1399
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,390
Haha!

1400
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,250
I mean...

1401
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,490
I mean...

1402
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,290
I mean...

1403
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:41,150
I mean...

1404
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:41,670
I mean...

1405
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:41,710
I mean...

1406
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:43,170
I mean...

1407
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:43,830
I mean...

1408
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:45,930
Let's keep going.

1409
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,870
We're doomed!

1410
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:48,810
What are you talking about?

1411
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:50,210
I totally blew that out.

1412
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,950
Are these more lockers?

1413
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,050
What?

1414
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:56,570
Oh, sorry.

1415
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,130
It has...

1416
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:00,950
Konami eyes!

1417
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,110
They're even in here!

1418
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,070
Wait a second.

1419
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:07,730
Um...

1420
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:09,590
Can I get a...

1421
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:11,630
Can I get a certain achievement?

1422
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:13,590
Being in there?

1423
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:14,330
Um...

1424
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:17,430
Uh...

1425
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:19,130
Anybody...

1426
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:20,830
Anybody want to get the, um...

1427
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,370
The snake beater?

1428
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,210
Achievement...

1429
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:27,430
Anybody...

1430
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:28,130
Anybody...

1431
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:32,150
Okay.

1432
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:33,350
It's okay.

1433
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,190
I'll take the sacrifice.

1434
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:39,550
Good night!

1435
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:54,760
What do you...

1436
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,420
What do you mean, ouch?

1437
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,920
No, I'm only doing really pleasurable things in here.

1438
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,170
Hoo-wee!

1439
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,910
I just flew in and boy...

1440
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:06,410
Are my arms tired!

1441
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,270
Okay, um...

1442
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:12,070
I think I used that joke one too many times today.

1443
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:14,530
Maybe.

1444
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:21,050
Uh...

1445
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:21,290
Wait.

1446
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:21,890
One second.

1447
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:25,390
Alright.

1448
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:25,930
Follow me!

1449
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:27,490
Oh no, we went this way.

1450
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,450
We want to go...

1451
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,410
There, through the exit over here.

1452
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:33,310
Right here.

1453
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:37,750
A-B connecting bridge.

1454
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:42,390
Wow...

1455
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:43,590
Wee!

1456
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:44,910
Wow!

1457
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,210
So beautiful!

1458
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:52,270
Wow!

1459
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:54,390
Box time!

1460
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,770
Let's keep going.

1461
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,910
Sorry if you're going through the walls sometimes.

1462
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:02,970
Look, you can see the water!

1463
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:04,410
Woah!

1464
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,360
Don't fall out.

1465
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:09,920
Don't fall...

1466
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,940
What if I do fall though?

1467
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:19,010
What if I do fall?

1468
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:20,910
Oops, my bad.

1469
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,040
Here we go!

1470
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:26,920
Wait.

1471
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:27,380
Huh!

1472
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,460
Right,

1473
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:33,310
what's wrong?

1474
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,710
Right!

1475
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:35,930
Right!

1476
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:39,850
Wait, could you...

1477
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:40,590
Could you see that?

1478
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,550
Or did you only see the...

1479
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:43,850
No, you only saw it.

1480
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:44,910
You only heard it, probably.

1481
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,250
It actually showed the whole menu.

1482
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:49,870
That was so good!

1483
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,720
It showed the whole menu and everything.

1484
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,560
It was just like...

1485
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,460
It showed like the...

1486
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,500
Sorry, I keep forgetting you guys were on this side.

1487
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,200
It showed the whole, like, you die menu and everything.

1488
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,360
What just happened?

1489
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,920
Don't worry about it.

1490
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,080
It's just ghost things, you know?

1491
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,720
Just ghost things.

1492
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:10,460
Okay.

1493
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,020
Um...

1494
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,640
This way.

1495
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,940
I'm trying to figure out how I want the camera to go.

1496
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,600
There we go.

1497
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,220
Oh!

1498
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:22,620
Oh!

1499
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,260
Wait!

1500
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,240
You must see!

1501
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,260
You must see!

1502
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:27,980
You must see!

1503
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:29,860
Look!

1504
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:38,950
Look, look, look!

1505
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:39,890
Oh my god!

1506
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:40,330
Oh my god!

1507
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:40,830
Oh my god!

1508
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:41,270
Oh my god!

1509
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:41,850
Oh my god!

1510
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:43,070
No!

1511
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:48,150
Let's go!

1512
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:50,430
Let's go!

1513
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:52,890
It's trying to be a transformer room.

1514
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,420
It's kind of spooky, isn't it?

1515
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,240
It's kind of spooky!

1516
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,600
Wait, I'm scared!

1517
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,040
Wait, but there's no one here.

1518
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,040
But me!

1519
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:09,560
I'm a ghost!

1520
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,560
I'm haunting this place.

1521
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,120
Okay, let's go.

1522
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,320
Whoa, there's so much blood on the ground!

1523
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,080
Wowee.

1524
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,380
Okay, let's go.

1525
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,280
Do you think he'll be here?

1526
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,020
Do you think he'll be here?

1527
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,730
Some winks!

1528
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,850
I hear another one.

1529
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:49,250
Dracula?

1530
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:50,190
No.

1531
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:52,410
Oh yeah.

1532
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:53,990
Okay, it's your turn.

1533
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,650
It's your turn to go in.

1534
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:58,510
Listen here.

1535
00:59:58,750 --> 00:59:59,870
Listen here, nerd.

1536
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,250
Yeah, nerd.

1537
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,910
I'm putting you...

1538
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:04,970
I'm putting you in the closet.

1539
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,530
I mean, the locker where you belong.

1540
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,670
And you never come back out.

1541
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:10,550
You hear me?

1542
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:12,790
Nerd!

1543
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:25,350
Was that enough for you?

1544
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:27,370
Was that enough time?

1545
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,170
Was that all you needed?

1546
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,170
I feel like you don't need that much time.

1547
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,630
Not for you, at least.

1548
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,070
What else is in here?

1549
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:36,610
Nothing.

1550
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:38,390
Nothing.

1551
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:40,370
Nothing here.

1552
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:45,310
Put me back in.

1553
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:46,890
What do you think this is?

1554
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,190
What do you think this is?

1555
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,830
The b-ball court?

1556
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:53,950
No, you're getting benched.

1557
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:56,410
Okay.

1558
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:57,090
One second.

1559
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:57,710
Okay.

1560
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,520
Follow me.

1561
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,740
There's so much blood in here.

1562
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,440
I sure hope some guys that are...

1563
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,120
some...

1564
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,860
I sure hope some guys named...

1565
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,440
I don't even know their name.

1566
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,360
Some guys that are, you know...

1567
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,860
allies of this ship.

1568
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,020
I sure hope they don't come in here.

1569
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,420
They're definitely allies.

1570
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:28,400
You know?

1571
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:31,360
I sure hope they don't come in here.

1572
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,540
Hold on, I gotta actually rearrange some stuff because my...

1573
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,020
My setup is all weird.

1574
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:38,360
Okay.

1575
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,120
Seal Team 10.

1576
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:42,820
Yeah.

1577
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,760
Sure hope not.

1578
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,140
Sure hope not.

1579
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,960
That would be really...

1580
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:49,680
I sure hope...

1581
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,460
I sure hope some guy...

1582
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,040
I sure hope some guy...

1583
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,340
doesn't sit here and smoke at all.

1584
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,900
That would be like...

1585
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,720
really weird.

1586
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,200
Oh my god.

1587
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,260
I'm freaking out a little bit.

1588
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,420
I sure hope some guy doesn't sit here and take a nap.

1589
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,600
My legs are getting jelly because I'm nervous.

1590
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:29,880
Because I'm nervous.

1591
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,620
Because I'm nervous.

1592
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,160
Can someone...

1593
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,380
Photoshop...

1594
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,520
Pushkin right here?

1595
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,340
Right there.

1596
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,700
Actually, in my arms.

1597
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,640
Where is my computer at?

1598
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:53,300
Oh, here.

1599
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,300
Thank you!

1600
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,760
Wait, hold on.

1601
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:57,680
Hold on.

1602
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,160
I can't read.

1603
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,280
I'm covered in cords.

1604
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,120
One second.

1605
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,080
One second.

1606
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,540
Where's my mouse?

1607
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,480
Oh, there it is.

1608
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:17,560
Thanks!

1609
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,640
I don't know actually which ones are showing up.

1610
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,280
But thank you.

1611
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:26,190
Alright.

1612
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:27,330
Let's go.

1613
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:29,310
Let's go.

1614
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:35,390
I'll be back for you.

1615
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:39,830
There's a nerd?

1616
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,070
And there's a nerd.

1617
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:45,710
Let's keep going this way.

1618
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:49,330
Jittery physics.

1619
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:50,110
Oh!

1620
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,870
There was no other door in here, was there?

1621
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:54,050
Sorry, I forgot.

1622
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:54,470
This one.

1623
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:58,690
Oh wait!

1624
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,110
We have to go down here.

1625
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:01,030
Not bad.

1626
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:08,790
Embrace the nerd.

1627
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:11,490
Oh wait, this way.

1628
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:12,030
There we go.

1629
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:14,970
We're on BC connecting bridge.

1630
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,090
I wanna find...

1631
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:20,670
This is gonna sound so bad.

1632
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:21,650
Oh, look at that!

1633
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:24,670
Wait, is this where he goes...

1634
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:25,610
It's a dud!

1635
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:33,170
Isn't this where Fortune destroys the bridge and he goes...

1636
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:33,850
A dud!

1637
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:36,830
Did you say no?

1638
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:38,090
Absolutely.

1639
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:38,390
Absolutely.

1640
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:41,750
Well, Fortune was here, right?

1641
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:42,990
Yeah, I think she was on the other side.

1642
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:45,970
What's it like in VR?

1643
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:47,550
Oh my god, it smells so good.

1644
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:49,650
I bet that's Fortune's smell.

1645
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:52,330
I bet Fortune's making that smell.

1646
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:54,670
Her pheromones.

1647
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:55,850
For me.

1648
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:00,910
Fortune.

1649
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:03,270
Fortune.

1650
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:03,850
Fortune.

1651
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,570
Anyway, I wanna find...

1652
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:09,750
Oops, sorry.

1653
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:11,230
I didn't mean to put you guys in the wall.

1654
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:14,270
My goal, even though I only have...

1655
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:15,290
Well, I have one hour.

1656
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:17,110
I wanna find...

1657
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:20,910
This is gonna sound so bad, but I wanna find where Emma gets shot.

1658
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:23,230
Because it's one of my favorite shots in the game.

1659
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:24,010
Well, not the...

1660
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:24,710
Not like...

1661
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:27,670
Viewing shot.

1662
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,630
Well, she doesn't get shot.

1663
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:31,510
She gets stabbed.

1664
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:33,570
We didn't shoot her.

1665
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:34,270
You know what I mean?

1666
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:37,170
Oh my god, wait!

1667
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:39,110
It's the bathroom!

1668
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,370
Oh my god!

1669
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,430
You can even see my thingy!

1670
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,350
This is how I'm viewing...

1671
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:50,710
What I'm doing for you guys.

1672
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,400
Oh say...

1673
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,440
Can you see...

1674
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,360
By the...

1675
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,440
Dazzling...

1676
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,640
Lights...

1677
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,960
God bless America.

1678
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:25,520
Whoa!

1679
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,660
Why is...

1680
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,520
Wait a second.

1681
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,920
Why is she in the girl's bathroom?

1682
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,340
Why is she on every...

1683
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,520
Star in the girl's bathroom?

1684
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,840
Also guys...

1685
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,860
I gotta go to the little ghost's room.

1686
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,040
One moment.

1687
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:53,280
Can I actually use the toilet?

1688
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:56,460
No.

1689
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:01,340
Stall's taken!

1690
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,160
Wonder who's in the men's room?

1691
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,140
Let's check it out!

1692
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,040
You and me.

1693
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,000
You and me.

1694
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,600
Gonna lift you up just a little bit.

1695
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:14,920
Ok.

1696
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:18,260
Ok, you ready?

1697
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:30,890
Follow me Oh wait!

1698
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:32,610
Oh wait.

1699
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:33,990
I use the bathroom, you guys.

1700
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,790
I have to...

1701
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:37,170
I have to...

1702
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:37,910
Wait hold on.

1703
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:38,990
Sorry.

1704
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:41,670
I'm always trying to adjust it so it's not too invasive.

1705
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,150
I have to...

1706
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:44,070
I have to wash my hands.

1707
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:48,530
Wash your hands dude.

1708
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:49,450
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1709
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:50,810
I'm working on it, okay?

1710
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:51,390
Gosh.

1711
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,470
Gotta get under my fingernails.

1712
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:57,970
Scrub-a-dub-a-dub.

1713
01:07:58,150 --> 01:07:59,170
Scrub-a-dub-a-dub.

1714
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:00,050
Scrub-a-dub-a-dub.

1715
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:01,890
What songs did they say that you can sing?

1716
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:04,630
Four.

1717
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:05,070
Four.

1718
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:06,570
Didn't flush the toilet?

1719
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:07,190
It's automatic.

1720
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:08,830
It's automatic.

1721
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:10,570
Gosh.

1722
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:12,990
I hear a bomb?

1723
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,370
It's just a bomb up there.

1724
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:17,630
Don't worry about it.

1725
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:18,550
It's decorative.

1726
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:27,030
Happy birthday.

1727
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:28,810
Happy birthday.

1728
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:29,390
Snake Eater?

1729
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:30,910
What a thrill.

1730
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:36,390
With darkness and silence through the night.

1731
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,290
What a thrill.

1732
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:44,470
I'm searching and I'll melt into you.

1733
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:45,750
Okay.

1734
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:47,630
Let's keep going.

1735
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:49,670
Oh wait, hold on.

1736
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:59,210
Okay, let's go now.

1737
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:01,910
To the men's room.

1738
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:07,010
I'm not supposed to be in there.

1739
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:08,950
Here we go.

1740
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:11,930
What?

1741
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:13,410
There's only two stalls?

1742
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,410
Why is there only two?

1743
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:18,630
How much you wanna bet she's in there?

1744
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:21,570
Oh, there she is.

1745
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:25,590
Where she is?

1746
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:27,350
Where she is?

1747
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:27,950
There she is!

1748
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:29,730
Oh, it's the urinals.

1749
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:38,910
Where do you flush?

1750
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,440
How do you flush it?

1751
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,780
It's automatic?

1752
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,700
Are you sure?

1753
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:58,560
Isn't...

1754
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,660
There's no water that comes through at all?

1755
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:03,140
So it just stinks like pee all the time?

1756
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:03,620
I don't know.

1757
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:03,740
So it just stinks like pee all the time?

1758
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:11,890
There is water.

1759
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:13,690
Oh, okay.

1760
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:15,930
Well, anyway.

1761
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:17,030
Let's get out of here.

1762
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:17,450
It stinks.

1763
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:20,610
Let's go down here.

1764
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,290
This is the kitchen, right?

1765
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:22,950
Yeah!

1766
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:24,730
Oh!

1767
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:28,090
The orange!

1768
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:30,690
Can I get in?

1769
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:32,570
Can I grab it?

1770
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:33,950
No, I can't interact.

1771
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:34,730
No!

1772
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:37,190
Oh my gosh, the orange!

1773
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:37,950
The orange!

1774
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:38,310
The orange!

1775
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:39,790
Just hold on.

1776
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:40,990
I can still blend in though.

1777
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:42,870
I can still blend in.

1778
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:52,410
Just a box.

1779
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:55,630
Just a box.

1780
01:10:57,970 --> 01:10:59,090
Just a box.

1781
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:03,970
Too short to use the urinal.

1782
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:05,090
Shut the hell up!

1783
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:06,590
Just a box.

1784
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:10,050
Nobody would know.

1785
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,330
How would they know?

1786
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:12,570
How would they know?

1787
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:13,030
Nobody would know.

1788
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:14,290
How would they know?

1789
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,200
Nobody would know.

1790
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:24,660
The Minto.

1791
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:32,150
It's 9.13.

1792
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:33,970
We got to go go go.

1793
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:36,910
We got to go find e-e and rescue her.

1794
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:47,570
But also, If they wanted me to go faster they shouldn't put this distracting images on the wall.

1795
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:51,110
I feel like this could be edited into a meme, you know?

1796
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:53,970
If I'm just like... hold on...

1797
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:57,570
If I'm just like...

1798
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:02,670
You know?

1799
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,250
You could put a picture here.

1800
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:27,590
Boo-ba.

1801
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,140
Okay, let's keep going.

1802
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,100
There's also... this is where...

1803
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,140
That's over... oh wait, sorry, you can't see it.

1804
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,600
Over there...

1805
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,320
Let me see if my controllers...

1806
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,440
My controllers are not...

1807
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,540
so great, but...

1808
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:47,800
mmm...

1809
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:51,080
I can't believe that they said that they were charged when they were at 0%.

1810
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,300
That's where...

1811
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,880
That's where the bomb guy was.

1812
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,240
Look at all these...

1813
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,780
You see her?

1814
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:11,720
Sheesh.

1815
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:13,520
Stillman, yeah, yeah.

1816
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,340
There's even watermelons here.

1817
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,540
Can you go in here?

1818
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,880
Oh wait, this isn't... oh, he was in there.

1819
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:20,960
That's right.

1820
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,440
I thought I got the wrong door.

1821
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,020
Can we go inside?

1822
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:23,880
Oh, we can!

1823
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:27,960
Not much in here.

1824
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,640
It's like this, it looks like you're spying on me.

1825
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,800
Stop, you creep.

1826
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,940
I love my gross ojisan, Oshi.

1827
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:36,480
She is such a freak, and we love her for that.

1828
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,360
I'm leaving!

1829
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,300
You guys don't understand me.

1830
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,900
I think this is the... yeah, this is the right way.

1831
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,980
Now we're on CD connecting bridge.

1832
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:03,960
Does anyone understand you?

1833
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,260
I don't know.

1834
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:09,000
No one understands me.

1835
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,500
No one gets me.

1836
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:12,480
We gotta go.

1837
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,460
Run, run, run.

1838
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:14,940
What's over here?

1839
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,520
Oh, this goes down.

1840
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,100
Wait, do these fall?

1841
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:24,200
Oh god.

1842
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,300
They do!

1843
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:33,040
They fall, they fall, they fall!

1844
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,100
Oh my god.

1845
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:44,170
How are you guys feeling?

1846
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,170
Are you guys motion sick at all?

1847
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:48,350
Are you guys feeling okay?

1848
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:50,050
Am I moving too fast?

1849
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:50,970
Am I moving too quickly?

1850
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:54,530
Are we alright?

1851
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:58,990
All good?

1852
01:14:59,210 --> 01:14:59,990
Not a bit?

1853
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:01,930
I'm good?

1854
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:02,650
It's perfect?

1855
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:04,170
I'm not motion sick?

1856
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:05,010
I'm just sick of you?

1857
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,390
I'M SICK OF YOU!

1858
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:11,860
Okay.

1859
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:12,640
Okay.

1860
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:16,480
I'm drunk right now.

1861
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,040
Don't drink and watch streams.

1862
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,640
Alright, let's go through here.

1863
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:24,360
Oh!

1864
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,280
Surveillance camera!

1865
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:27,360
Oh my gosh, look at it!

1866
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:27,980
It's moving even!

1867
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:32,360
Okay,

1868
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:39,180
let's go through here.

1869
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,760
Oh, it's dark.

1870
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,800
Strut D, sediment pool.

1871
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,420
Oh, I hate this area!

1872
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,840
I HATE this area!

1873
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,640
I hate this area.

1874
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,240
Did I mention I hate this area?

1875
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:53,800
Woah...

1876
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:57,140
You can see in there, and like the...

1877
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,320
There's like...

1878
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,940
Hold on, let me see if I can show you guys.

1879
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:08,650
You can see like...

1880
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:09,810
Oh, sorry, auto levels.

1881
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:16,330
You see like the reflections and stuff from the... I guess the steam?

1882
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:17,270
From the water?

1883
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:18,910
Or whatever the hell that is.

1884
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:23,170
Thinks she likes this area.

1885
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:23,650
NO!

1886
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:26,090
You need to learn how to listen.

1887
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:28,490
Don't drop us.

1888
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:40,590
One second.

1889
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,200
Okay, let's go.

1890
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,360
Which way should I go though?

1891
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:56,880
Actually, I don't remember.

1892
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,280
There's this one, and then there's that one.

1893
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,220
There's that one over there.

1894
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,440
And then there's also the lower levels.

1895
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,940
Oh no way, I don't remember which way to go.

1896
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,360
The nerd is down there.

1897
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:12,660
Nothing here.

1898
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:16,660
But this is MGS fans dream come true, for real.

1899
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:17,680
Love this for you.

1900
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:19,700
I know, it's so fun!

1901
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:20,700
Oh my god.

1902
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,540
It's so awesome.

1903
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,520
I don't remember this particular building.

1904
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,680
I don't remember which way gets us to Emma.

1905
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,080
This is...

1906
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:40,340
Level 1.

1907
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,180
I can't read.

1908
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:42,880
What's this one?

1909
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:46,820
You're an expert, Minto.

1910
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,040
I'm not an expert with...

1911
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:49,320
Oh!

1912
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:50,100
Shell 1 to 2!

1913
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,860
Wait, can we even get through here?

1914
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:52,980
Or will it tell us no?

1915
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:56,100
Yeah.

1916
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:56,280
Yeah.

1917
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:58,840
Um...

1918
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:00,680
I think...

1919
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,220
This is where we get the cell phone.

1920
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,400
I think...

1921
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,800
We have...

1922
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,200
A bit of a problem.

1923
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,200
Actually, now that I think about it...

1924
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,720
There's areas all around here that look like where...

1925
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,060
Wait a second.

1926
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,280
I think actually over there.

1927
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:19,060
That might be it.

1928
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,040
Hold on, let me show you guys.

1929
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,280
Cause it has the staircase.

1930
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,100
Or the ladder.

1931
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:31,400
Right there?

1932
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:33,640
Right?

1933
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,700
Is that it?

1934
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:35,840
Maybe?

1935
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,680
Sorry, my sleeves are so big.

1936
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,700
That right there, right?

1937
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,920
Pretty sure that's where we...

1938
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,860
Where we went down from.

1939
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,080
And then they cross...

1940
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,980
They cross through here, right?

1941
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,560
But at the same time...

1942
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,680
Here, I'll show you the other side.

1943
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:55,280
It looks the exact same.

1944
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,140
So I'm not quite sure anymore.

1945
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:00,160
Alright guys, I'm gonna have to jump.

1946
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,300
But I'm gonna make this jump without you.

1947
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:02,540
Okay?

1948
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,800
I'll bring you over once it's safe.

1949
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,160
I'll bring you over once it's safe.

1950
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:07,980
Okay?

1951
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,800
Here, watch me from afar.

1952
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,940
You can do it.

1953
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,000
Alright kid.

1954
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,160
I'll see you later.

1955
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:29,740
On the other side.

1956
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:00,830
We did it!

1957
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:04,650
What, you think that I didn't do it?

1958
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:05,470
Come on.

1959
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:09,390
We did it.

1960
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:10,570
We did it.

1961
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:14,670
Come on.

1962
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:15,910
Come on.

1963
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,330
Come on.

1964
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:18,590
Alright.

1965
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,430
Now look at me.

1966
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:23,370
Don't look at me.

1967
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:25,130
I'll turn around.

1968
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:27,290
It's really smoky here.

1969
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:28,390
So we gotta be careful, okay?

1970
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:29,410
Wait, actually...

1971
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,050
How do I get over there?

1972
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:35,870
Uh...

1973
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:37,810
Hold on, I don't wanna fall off.

1974
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:39,110
Okay.

1975
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:40,230
Here we go.

1976
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:40,910
I got it.

1977
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:41,710
We're gonna jump through here.

1978
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:43,510
Nice!

1979
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:44,970
Nice!

1980
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:46,690
Run, run, run!

1981
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,360
They fell through.

1982
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,240
Don't get peed on.

1983
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,860
I think we're safe from...

1984
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,020
Do you guys... wait.

1985
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,360
Can you see it?

1986
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,240
Up there, the ship...

1987
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:07,400
That's not...

1988
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,960
That's not the ship that...

1989
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:10,720
Solidus... not ship.

1990
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:11,340
Oh my gosh.

1991
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,540
The... Solidus doesn't use a plane though.

1992
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,180
Or is it the Harrier?

1993
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:16,720
I can't tell.

1994
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:17,260
Is it?

1995
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:18,760
It is the Harrier?

1996
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:25,990
Yeah, it looks like the Harrier.

1997
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:27,050
Oh my god!

1998
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:29,430
It's Solidus' Harrier!

1999
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:31,210
Wow!

2000
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:35,950
So cool.

2001
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,130
There's so many things in this game.

2002
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:41,350
I mean, in this recreation, I guess.

2003
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:42,950
Alright, we gotta jump down.

2004
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:44,930
Okay.

2005
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:45,650
Very good.

2006
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:48,790
And then, I don't know if you guys...

2007
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:49,450
Oh, you can see it.

2008
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,850
Look, it says return to the...

2009
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:52,570
Teleport, if you need to go back up.

2010
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:53,830
Or if you wanna go back up.

2011
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:54,710
But not us!

2012
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:56,950
I wonder if I drop from down there?

2013
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:57,790
I wonder if we'll make it.

2014
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,300
You think?

2015
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:05,680
Oh, oh, oh.

2016
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,120
Wait, how am I supposed to get over there?

2017
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:10,320
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

2018
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,540
Okay, okay, okay.

2019
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,200
Oh my god!

2020
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:17,280
We made it!

2021
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:17,860
We made it!

2022
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:18,320
We made it!

2023
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,540
You can get a better look of it from here too.

2024
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:22,420
Hi Solidus!

2025
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:26,120
Hi Solidus!

2026
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:29,340
I'm using my gunpowder like a good girl!

2027
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:30,980
Parkour.

2028
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:32,720
Teleport.

2029
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,900
Stretch out perimeter.

2030
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,440
Oh my gosh, you can see it even more from here!

2031
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,640
Hi Solidus!

2032
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:44,540
Hi Solidus!

2033
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,220
Wait, big shell?

2034
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:49,100
Yeah, isn't this awesome?

2035
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:51,840
Okay.

2036
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,600
Oh geez.

2037
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,580
You guys, uh...

2038
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,240
This one's not looking so good.

2039
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:00,660
Okay, I think I have to be very, very careful.

2040
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,160
Sorry for the camera.

2041
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:04,700
Sorry for the camera.

2042
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,020
It doesn't look like that to me, only to you.

2043
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:09,040
Okay, here we go.

2044
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:10,360
Onwards!

2045
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:14,420
Uh...

2046
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:16,120
Uh...

2047
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,360
Whoa, it's like really broken for you guys right now.

2048
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,420
There we go.

2049
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:22,500
Ahem.

2050
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,800
Hug the wall.

2051
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,200
Oh, and this also is if you want to return.

2052
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:29,100
Nice!

2053
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:30,880
Okay.

2054
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,810
We're going up.

2055
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:36,310
Shell 2!

2056
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:38,930
Hi Shell 2!

2057
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:42,250
Wait, where is, um...

2058
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:45,410
Where do we see...

2059
01:23:45,410 --> 01:23:46,850
Fat Man at?

2060
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:48,090
I can't remember.

2061
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:50,030
Gosh, I can't wait to play MGS2.

2062
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:55,020
Beep beep!

2063
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,100
What do you mean beep beep?

2064
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:58,680
What do you mean?

2065
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,680
What do you mean beep beep?

2066
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:03,800
Hold on.

2067
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,920
I also gotta fix my camera stuff again real quick.

2068
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:06,500
Sorry guys.

2069
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:20,440
I keep turning and since my VR stuff is is on a cord, right now it's a little difficult to...

2070
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,320
It's a little...

2071
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,320
I keep turning and so it makes it harder to move around.

2072
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:27,760
Beep beep!

2073
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,420
What do you mean beep beep?

2074
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,120
We need the access card.

2075
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:36,120
Put you up even.

2076
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,620
Maybe it's too high up.

2077
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:39,800
Put you back a little bit.

2078
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:40,520
There we go.

2079
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,220
This is better, right?

2080
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:44,940
Okay.

2081
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,340
If I... Okay, wait.

2082
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:47,940
I have a second.

2083
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,080
Not a second.

2084
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:49,660
I have a...

2085
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,320
I have an idea.

2086
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:58,940
What if because you guys are the camera, I just walk backwards and then you guys tell me what's in there.

2087
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,560
What is it?

2088
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:02,040
What do you see?

2089
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:03,840
What's in there?

2090
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:04,960
What's in there?

2091
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,520
Do you see anything?

2092
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,220
Do you have a second?

2093
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:11,380
It's darkness.

2094
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,580
It's a black hole.

2095
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:13,880
It's the void.

2096
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,240
I guess...

2097
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,700
I guess it's a good thing we can't go in there.

2098
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,920
If it's all just darkness.

2099
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,860
Oh, geez.

2100
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:25,960
Um...

2101
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,740
Hold on one second.

2102
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:35,490
Hmm...

2103
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:38,270
Hmm...

2104
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:38,310
Hmm...

2105
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:39,970
Let's just keep going.

2106
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:43,410
I think I see fortune.

2107
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:45,210
Don't lie to me.

2108
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:46,150
Don't lie to me.

2109
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:46,950
Don't get my hopes up.

2110
01:25:49,190 --> 01:25:50,170
Shell two core.

2111
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:51,350
One floor.

2112
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:52,250
First floor.

2113
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:53,990
Air purification room.

2114
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:56,490
Oh my gosh.

2115
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:59,470
Also, you guys can't really see it, but the floors are so shiny.

2116
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:00,770
Wait!

2117
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:01,410
The president!

2118
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:05,690
I'm coming for you, Mr. President!

2119
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:08,790
Oh, he's not.

2120
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:09,370
He's...

2121
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:11,670
You guys, he's already long gone.

2122
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:13,650
He's dead dead.

2123
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:16,850
High voltage.

2124
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:19,830
He's...

2125
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:20,910
This is where it comes through.

2126
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:21,930
Right here.

2127
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:24,770
You're a man?

2128
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:26,770
No, I'm a mint.

2129
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:27,790
...

2130
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:29,270
...

2131
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:32,330
Let's keep going this way.

2132
01:26:33,010 --> 01:26:33,970
And this...

2133
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:39,090
This I would like to fondly call Trauma Central.

2134
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,480
I'm going to do a reenactment.

2135
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,140
I'm going to do a reenactment of...

2136
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,240
of trying to get Emma out of this location.

2137
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,080
No, Emma, please!

2138
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,400
Get up, Emma!

2139
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:00,340
Just get up!

2140
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:02,960
There she is!

2141
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:03,880
...

2142
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:07,800
Oh my god!

2143
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:09,380
I'm going to have to drag Emma!

2144
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:10,320
I'm going to have to drag her!

2145
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:14,460
...

2146
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:17,060
...

2147
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:18,420
...

2148
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:19,400
...

2149
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:20,320
...

2150
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:23,320
...

2151
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:24,640
...

2152
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:28,360
Okay.

2153
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:29,600
Okay.

2154
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,260
They're dead.

2155
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,180
Come on, Emma!

2156
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,080
Come on!

2157
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:33,100
Come on, Emma!

2158
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:33,920
Come on!

2159
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:38,770
...

2160
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:39,430
...

2161
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:43,790
Oh my god, there's more!

2162
01:27:44,970 --> 01:27:45,650
...

2163
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:46,890
...

2164
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:47,210
...

2165
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:50,210
There's too many!

2166
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:51,290
Emma, I'm sorry!

2167
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:52,870
I gotta get out of here!

2168
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:53,730
...

2169
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:56,070
Snake!

2170
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:56,910
Please!

2171
01:27:56,970 --> 01:27:57,810
I need your help!

2172
01:27:58,050 --> 01:27:58,650
Snake!

2173
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:00,370
I'm going offline!

2174
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:02,650
Snaaaaaaake!

2175
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:07,430
End scene.

2176
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,680
Did you guys like that?

2177
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:23,980
Thank you.

2178
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:24,820
Thank you.

2179
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:29,280
I'm trapped.

2180
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:29,880
Oh, wait.

2181
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:33,920
Thank you.

2182
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:35,320
Thank you.

2183
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:36,840
Thank you.

2184
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,260
That's so cute, I can't bear it.

2185
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,120
Stop it!

2186
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:43,220
Stop it.

2187
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:43,640
Stop it.

2188
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:45,100
Okay, let's keep going.

2189
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,720
Oh, no, no, no, I just messed up my camera.

2190
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:51,340
I'm so sorry.

2191
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,540
Okay, like so.

2192
01:28:58,740 --> 01:28:59,140
Cinema.

2193
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:02,700
Okay, we'll just go this way.

2194
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:06,780
Then we get to the elevator over here and we can go see...

2195
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:08,900
Wait a second, though.

2196
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:10,860
So we take Emma...

2197
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,720
Emma back through there.

2198
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,200
Let's see what happens if we go downstairs, though.

2199
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:17,180
Call elevator.

2200
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:20,640
Oh, nice.

2201
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:22,300
Okay, here we go.

2202
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:27,380
B... B1.

2203
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:35,180
It's peak.

2204
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,720
Are there any bugs down here?

2205
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:41,700
Oh, they didn't include the bugs!

2206
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:43,460
There's no bugs, actually.

2207
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,520
Beep, boop, bop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2208
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:49,700
Babycore, thanks for the gift.

2209
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:50,580
Thank you.

2210
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:51,460
Whoa!

2211
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:52,720
Oh, my God.

2212
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:53,340
Oh.

2213
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:54,140
Whoa!

2214
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:55,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2215
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:57,140
Wait, how do I swim?

2216
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,940
Is there a way to go down?

2217
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:01,780
Oh, gosh, you guys.

2218
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:03,460
I don't know if we can go through here.

2219
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:06,180
Okay, hold on.

2220
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:10,220
How do I go down?

2221
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:13,340
Uh...

2222
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,680
We managed to avoid drowning.

2223
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:18,260
Oh, bonk.

2224
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:19,160
Come on.

2225
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,580
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck.

2226
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:24,560
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck.

2227
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,940
I don't think we can go.

2228
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,600
Press the left stick down to deser...

2229
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:36,090
Blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub.

2230
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:37,330
Call the colonel.

2231
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:41,910
Aw, guys, I tried.

2232
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:46,350
Unless, like, it's jump for some reason.

2233
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:51,800
Oh, wait.

2234
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:54,040
Oh, wait.

2235
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:54,760
I was in there.

2236
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,300
I was in there.

2237
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:55,940
You saw, right?

2238
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:57,480
Okay, hold on.

2239
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:01,300
Take it.

2240
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:02,740
Okay,

2241
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:07,110
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2242
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:07,650
No!

2243
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:12,240
Oh, man.

2244
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:14,000
Ghosts.

2245
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:15,320
Ghosts just float.

2246
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:16,540
Apparently.

2247
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,180
I have to use my own arm?

2248
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,000
I do.

2249
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:26,630
Ew.

2250
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:31,690
No, no, no, no, no, no!

2251
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:34,190
No, no, no, no!

2252
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:36,210
Blub blub blub blub blub blub.

2253
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:37,490
No!

2254
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:39,250
Blub blub blub blub blub blub.

2255
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:39,750
Ah!

2256
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:43,210
RMIT, blub blub blub blub blub.

2257
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:43,450
Ah!

2258
01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:45,490
Card off!

2259
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:46,770
Blub blub blub bluv adulh!

2260
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:50,010
Let's get out of here.

2261
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:51,510
Grace, please help!

2262
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:52,350
He's coming.

2263
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:53,510
Okay, wait.

2264
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:56,450
So, we take... Aw, that's kind of disappointing though.

2265
01:31:56,550 --> 01:32:01,590
I thought for sure we would be able to go see the room where EE is at.

2266
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:04,950
Wait, this way is more comfortable.

2267
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:05,970
Okay, let's go inside.

2268
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:10,410
I hope you guys don't mind just seeing my back the whole time.

2269
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:12,070
I figured it's kind of like...

2270
01:32:13,290 --> 01:32:16,030
We're on the journey together, you know what I mean?

2271
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:21,210
You're just following behind me.

2272
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:22,490
Kind of deal, you know?

2273
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:26,070
Cold drinks?

2274
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,420
I'm throwing my money in there.

2275
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:38,720
Okay.

2276
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,580
Very good.

2277
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:41,320
It's fine.

2278
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,280
Okay, I'm glad.

2279
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:44,520
And then there's some security cameras in here.

2280
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:46,960
Or not.

2281
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,040
Never mind.

2282
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:49,580
Wow, now I'm a liar.

2283
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,120
So, we bring her back.

2284
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:51,640
Back through here.

2285
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,420
Conscious or unconscious.

2286
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,280
So, this is where we came from.

2287
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,380
And then we were like...

2288
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,860
Then we were like...

2289
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:05,380
Wait, where do we go from here?

2290
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,820
All I remember is...

2291
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:09,840
Is it down... No, it's not down there.

2292
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,100
How do we get to the...

2293
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:16,560
How do we get down there?

2294
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,300
I only have 30 minutes left.

2295
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:26,480
What do I do?

2296
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,760
Strut L.

2297
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:32,340
Where's Strut L?

2298
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:33,660
Gosh, I wish I had a map.

2299
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,920
The door that leads down to Oil Fence is left maybe.

2300
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,080
No, this is the one that...

2301
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:43,260
That went boop-boop.

2302
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:44,920
Unless we can't get down there.

2303
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:46,300
Let's see.

2304
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:47,720
Strut on the right.

2305
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:49,200
Oh, you're right!

2306
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:50,560
Right here.

2307
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:55,900
And here?

2308
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,120
Strut L Sewage Treatment Facility.

2309
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:01,960
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

2310
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:02,920
I remember this!

2311
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:03,460
I remember this!

2312
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,260
Uh-oh, I might accidentally pin a comment.

2313
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:09,620
Sorry.

2314
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,340
I'm trying to open this up.

2315
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,700
My chat is right here, so that's why.

2316
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,580
Where am I?

2317
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:23,620
Where is this place?

2318
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:24,420
Huh?

2319
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:27,180
Huh?

2320
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:28,780
Huh?

2321
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:32,100
Oh, you guys can see the outside world, but I can't.

2322
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:33,160
Hmm?

2323
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,180
Oh, the hatch!

2324
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:42,860
There it is!

2325
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:46,740
Oh, it looks really funky.

2326
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:47,280
Oh, my...

2327
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:47,580
Oh!

2328
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:49,560
What?

2329
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:50,640
There's a gun!

2330
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:52,200
Oh, my God.

2331
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:53,280
There's the sniper!

2332
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:54,640
Oh, my God.

2333
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:54,680
Oh, my God.

2334
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:54,840
Oh, my God.

2335
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:55,140
Oh, my God.

2336
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:58,860
Oh, this is so funny!

2337
01:34:58,860 --> 01:34:59,040
Oh, my God.

2338
01:34:59,040 --> 01:34:59,060
Oh!

2339
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:00,000
It's a little heavy.

2340
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:00,820
My bad.

2341
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:19,040
And then we listen over here, and it's Johnny pooping himself, and then if I shoot over here, there's Snake!

2342
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:21,280
Wait, hold on, I want you guys to see.

2343
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:24,580
Oh, my bad.

2344
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,040
One second.

2345
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:25,520
Hmm.

2346
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:28,680
How can I get you...

2347
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:29,460
the full view?

2348
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,200
Will you guys protect me?

2349
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:32,660
If I, um...

2350
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:33,780
Okay.

2351
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:35,200
You guys, I'm giving you the gun.

2352
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:38,660
If I can pick it up.

2353
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:39,580
Wait.

2354
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:40,300
Hold on.

2355
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:42,460
There we go.

2356
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,780
I'm giving you guys the gun.

2357
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:53,260
And you have to shoot down anything that tries to attack me while I go all the way over to the other side.

2358
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:54,120
Okay?

2359
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:58,380
It's your response.

2360
01:35:58,680 --> 01:35:59,280
It's your duty.

2361
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,060
Take it.

2362
01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:07,450
I'll see you later.

2363
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:08,750
Soldier.

2364
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:16,260
Oh!

2365
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,260
I almost fell in.

2366
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:34,460
Where are the stars in the skies up above?

2367
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:40,520
And think what am I made of?

2368
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:45,380
Am I full of sorrow?

2369
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,480
Am I hurt when pained?

2370
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:54,500
Or am I filled with... Right.

2371
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,520
What's wrong?

2372
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,900
Right!

2373
01:36:59,060 --> 01:36:59,120
Right!

2374
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:08,580
You guys are supposed to protect me!

2375
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:17,220
You guys are supposed to... You guys are supposed to protect me!

2376
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:17,720
What happened?

2377
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:19,500
What happened?

2378
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:24,860
Okay.

2379
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:26,120
I got one more shot.

2380
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:28,340
I'm believing in you.

2381
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:34,280
Okay.

2382
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:39,800
Um...

2383
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:42,560
What am I made of?

2384
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:46,460
Am I full... Sorry if I get the lyrics wrong by the way.

2385
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:47,100
I can't really remember.

2386
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:47,500
You know what?

2387
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:47,960
I'm gonna go around.

2388
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:51,300
Oh my god!

2389
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:51,760
Johnny!

2390
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:52,120
Wait.

2391
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:52,320
No.

2392
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:53,100
He's at the next one.

2393
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:53,480
Just kidding.

2394
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:54,160
Haha.

2395
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:55,720
You thought...

2396
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:57,840
Wait.

2397
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:58,960
You thought...

2398
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,200
You thought there was Johnny.

2399
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:02,380
Nope.

2400
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:03,160
I was just kidding.

2401
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:04,960
Hi mom!

2402
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:06,500
Wow.

2403
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,560
It's so beautiful from here.

2404
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:11,420
Actually I kinda wish the sky was a little bit more orange.

2405
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:14,600
It's so nice over here.

2406
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:15,920
Wish you were here!

2407
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:23,560
Or am I filled with love?

2408
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:27,880
I walk down the street.

2409
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:29,880
Oh.

2410
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:30,280
Oh!

2411
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:30,840
Wait!

2412
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,100
Wait a second.

2413
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:32,940
There's actually something here.

2414
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:34,520
There's like a headset here.

2415
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:35,680
Oh my god.

2416
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:36,340
It reeks!

2417
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:37,200
Oh my god.

2418
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:37,380
Wait.

2419
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,280
I'm not lying.

2420
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:41,440
There's actually like a... like a... what's the word?

2421
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:43,300
Like a pair of headphones.

2422
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:44,000
A pair of headphones.

2423
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:46,340
Can I pick them up?

2424
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:47,940
Doesn't look like it.

2425
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,040
Oh my god.

2426
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:49,440
Johnny!

2427
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,100
Johnny Akiba!

2428
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,420
Johnny Akiba Sasaki!

2429
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:53,860
What are you doing here?

2430
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:54,580
What are you doing here?

2431
01:38:57,820 --> 01:38:58,800
Oh my god!

2432
01:38:58,860 --> 01:38:59,600
Not on my stream!

2433
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:04,120
Hi guys!

2434
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:06,140
Hello!

2435
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:06,900
Can you see me?

2436
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:08,740
Can you see me waving at you?

2437
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:21,010
Wow!

2438
01:39:21,010 --> 01:39:22,270
It's so beautiful!

2439
01:39:25,330 --> 01:39:25,890
Hey guys!

2440
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:26,930
Don't forget to shoot it!

2441
01:39:26,930 --> 01:39:28,070
If anything comes and gets me!

2442
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:31,710
Don't forget to shoot!

2443
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:36,780
Don't forget to shoot!

2444
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:38,900
If anything comes and gets me!

2445
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:42,740
I sure hope no bisexuals come out of the water!

2446
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,680
You took the ammo with you.

2447
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:55,700
No I didn't.

2448
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:58,640
I'm looking in the water.

2449
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:00,420
It looks pretty clear.

2450
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:02,860
I sure hope!

2451
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,060
That there's no bisexuals in the water!

2452
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:06,360
That there's no bisexuals in the water!

2453
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:09,740
Oh no!

2454
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:11,100
Oh god!

2455
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:11,880
Oh no!

2456
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:11,880
Oh god!

2457
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:11,880
Oh!

2458
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:12,500
Oh!

2459
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:13,280
Oh!

2460
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:13,380
Oh!

2461
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:14,580
Right!

2462
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:16,540
What's wrong?

2463
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:18,780
Right!

2464
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:19,180
Right!

2465
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:27,080
Do you guys want to go on Emma's simulator?

2466
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:27,680
Do you guys want to go on Emma's simulator?

2467
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:29,540
Follow me!

2468
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:30,080
Follow me!

2469
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:31,940
Like I said, it's really pretty.

2470
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:32,320
Like I said, it's really pretty.

2471
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:38,440
Alright, here we go.

2472
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:42,200
You can see the whole place from here.

2473
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:42,600
Oh!

2474
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:43,180
Don't fall!

2475
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:43,560
Don't fall!

2476
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:43,820
Don't fall!

2477
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:44,480
Don't fall!

2478
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,000
Don't fall!

2479
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:47,040
Don't fall!

2480
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:47,640
Don't fall!

2481
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:48,040
Don't fall!

2482
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,060
We can take it slow.

2483
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:50,720
We can take it slow.

2484
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:52,940
I'll show you the headphones that were on the other side and everything.

2485
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:57,410
Right!

2486
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:58,070
What's wrong?

2487
01:40:59,170 --> 01:40:59,490
Right!

2488
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:00,750
Right!

2489
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:04,070
Uh...

2490
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:05,010
Anyway...

2491
01:41:05,990 --> 01:41:07,610
It's harder than it looks, okay guys?

2492
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:10,210
It's harder...

2493
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:12,730
It's harder than it looks, okay?

2494
01:41:14,490 --> 01:41:16,830
It takes more balance than you'd realize.

2495
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:17,990
Okay.

2496
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:19,890
Okay.

2497
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:20,830
Okay.

2498
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:24,610
Then you come around here and it's just the vast, vast ocean.

2499
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:25,690
Then you come around here and it's just the vast, vast ocean.

2500
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:27,490
It's just all ocean.

2501
01:41:28,030 --> 01:41:29,330
It's nothing much else.

2502
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:30,810
But I love the ocean.

2503
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:32,590
So I really like this.

2504
01:41:32,810 --> 01:41:33,110
Okay.

2505
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:33,790
Let's keep going.

2506
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:37,270
Watch your step now.

2507
01:41:37,370 --> 01:41:38,070
Watch your step.

2508
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:40,410
Okay.

2509
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:41,570
Good.

2510
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:42,810
Good.

2511
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:43,090
Good.

2512
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:43,370
Good.

2513
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:43,710
Okay.

2514
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:48,620
We're going.

2515
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:49,780
We're going.

2516
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:50,760
We're going.

2517
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:51,400
We're running.

2518
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:51,860
We're running.

2519
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:52,260
We're running.

2520
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:52,720
We're running.

2521
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:53,180
We're running.

2522
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:53,600
We're running.

2523
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:55,580
And jump!

2524
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:57,400
Okay.

2525
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,100
See him?

2526
01:41:58,220 --> 01:41:58,860
See right there?

2527
01:41:59,080 --> 01:41:59,740
See right there?

2528
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,120
It's a pair of headphones.

2529
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:08,620
But I can't pick them up for some reason.

2530
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:12,780
Oh wait!

2531
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:13,300
Listen!

2532
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:16,320
A girl?

2533
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,360
What are you doing here?

2534
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:20,840
It's my choice, thank you very much.

2535
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:21,440
Oh.

2536
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:24,180
You're not gonna shoot me.

2537
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:25,020
No.

2538
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:25,860
Why not?

2539
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:28,260
Stay away from good looking women when you're fighting.

2540
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:29,780
Otherwise you'll get hit with diarrhea.

2541
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:32,980
One of the few things I learned from Shadow Moses.

2542
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:34,720
What are you talking about?

2543
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:36,020
Ancient history.

2544
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:37,440
Don't worry about it.

2545
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,280
I have no idea what you're talking about.

2546
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,500
But does this mean you're letting me go?

2547
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:44,620
Well, you could have found a nicer way to say that.

2548
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:45,460
But sure.

2549
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:46,600
Better hurry.

2550
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:47,360
Thanks.

2551
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:48,580
Don't mention it.

2552
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:49,500
Just run like a...

2553
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,760
Oh no, my stomach.

2554
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:53,140
Not again.

2555
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,640
This place is about to sink.

2556
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,240
Just get out fast, okay?

2557
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,120
Oh god.

2558
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:01,300
What?

2559
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:02,660
What's your name?

2560
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:04,200
Don't have one.

2561
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:06,220
Okay, fine.

2562
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:07,700
It's Johnny.

2563
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:08,420
Johnny!

2564
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,060
I'm not gonna make it.

2565
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:12,980
Hey, if we run into each other again...

2566
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:17,200
What a weird guy.

2567
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:18,800
Oh!

2568
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,140
Oh my god!

2569
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:21,740
Oh my god!

2570
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,080
That was so fun!

2571
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:25,820
Did you guys hear that?

2572
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:28,780
I didn't...

2573
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:30,300
I guess I just didn't...

2574
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:32,500
I didn't lean down far enough before.

2575
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:34,260
Oh my god!

2576
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:35,540
Oh my god.

2577
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,540
That was so awesome.

2578
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,080
The whole thing.

2579
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:40,980
Perfect.

2580
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:43,520
I'm so glad that we came back then.

2581
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:47,000
I'm so glad that we came back then.

2582
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:49,820
Okay, careful, careful.

2583
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:51,960
I wish up there though you could...

2584
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:52,620
Oh wait, hold on.

2585
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:55,580
I wish up there you could see...

2586
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:57,560
Wait, you could see a little cypher going by!

2587
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:58,420
It's so cute!

2588
01:43:59,340 --> 01:43:59,700
Um...

2589
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:01,280
Wait, hold on.

2590
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:04,500
I'll be very careful to show you.

2591
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,240
Oh wait, no, you're all the way out in the ocean.

2592
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:08,020
I can't grab you.

2593
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:09,740
Hold on, let me go back upstairs.

2594
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:17,840
Gimme.

2595
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:20,280
Oh wait.

2596
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:22,420
There we go.

2597
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:24,920
You see it?

2598
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,240
You see it flying around up there?

2599
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:30,340
Cypher!

2600
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:32,360
Oh, it's gone now.

2601
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:37,240
Chat, is the streamer about to cry because she loves MGS2 so much?

2602
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:38,120
Stop it!

2603
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:39,800
Stop!

2604
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:41,840
Why you gotta...

2605
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,180
Why you gotta call me out like that?

2606
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:46,940
Stop calling me out.

2607
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:47,140
Stop calling me out.

2608
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,080
Hmm...

2609
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:51,700
Okay.

2610
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:54,820
Let's keep going.

2611
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,420
Hold on, let me adjust myself as well.

2612
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:07,760
There we go.

2613
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:09,600
And you.

2614
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:16,220
I think that should be good.

2615
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,660
Okay, let's go.

2616
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:22,800
Let's go to where she died.

2617
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,520
But I also wanna show you...

2618
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:25,580
Wait, can I?

2619
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:27,340
Oh yeah, I can grab you from there.

2620
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:28,240
Okay, good, good, good.

2621
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:34,480
This is where she dies.

2622
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:36,300
Look how beautiful!

2623
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:37,020
Hold on.

2624
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:39,580
Have to be very careful.

2625
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:41,080
Come here.

2626
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:51,760
Wow!

2627
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:55,860
It's so pretty!

2628
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:57,800
It's actually so relaxing here.

2629
01:45:58,440 --> 01:45:58,840
Haha.

2630
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:00,740
It's so relaxing.

2631
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:01,900
Any vamp easter eggs?

2632
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:02,640
I don't think so.

2633
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:03,700
I don't see anything.

2634
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:05,260
There's not even blood here.

2635
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:06,880
It's not even blood.

2636
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,600
I think actually she dies down a little bit.

2637
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:11,520
Oops, sorry.

2638
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:13,480
I can't grab you.

2639
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:15,080
Come on.

2640
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:17,600
Come on.

2641
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:20,060
I kept trying to grab you but I can't for some reason.

2642
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:21,240
Oh, there we go.

2643
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:23,620
I think actually she dies right before it, right?

2644
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:25,640
Like right here.

2645
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:27,740
But there's still no blood or anything.

2646
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:36,020
I say die, I mean get stabbed.

2647
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:41,060
When she gets attacked.

2648
01:46:44,470 --> 01:46:47,130
So that means the next location should be...

2649
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:51,030
Where she actually dies.

2650
01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:52,250
Right?

2651
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:53,690
What time is it?

2652
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:54,890
Oh, I have 10 minutes!

2653
01:46:55,190 --> 01:46:56,190
Oh gosh, you guys.

2654
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:59,250
Strut E, Parcel Room 1F.

2655
01:47:01,690 --> 01:47:02,110
Here.

2656
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:04,010
Shoop.

2657
01:47:04,010 --> 01:47:04,430
Shoop.

2658
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:04,890
Shoop.

2659
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:05,730
Shoop.

2660
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:06,090
Shoop.

2661
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,510
And we go through here.

2662
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:11,750
And here.

2663
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:13,450
Oh, there's the Zone of the Enders boxes!

2664
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:18,060
What's up here?

2665
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:20,940
Oh, this is where the boxes are.

2666
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:21,520
Just kidding.

2667
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:23,460
Actually, I have no idea where we are now.

2668
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:24,700
Hahaha.

2669
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:28,720
Ahhh!

2670
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:34,540
Can I get up there?

2671
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:37,720
I don't think so.

2672
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:40,800
There it goes!

2673
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:42,720
Wee!

2674
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:45,380
Wee!

2675
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:48,200
Well, guys...

2676
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:56,100
Actually, I kind of want to end off in the nice sunset area, if that's okay.

2677
01:47:57,900 --> 01:47:59,380
So we'll go back outside.

2678
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:01,660
So we'll go back outside.

2679
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:05,420
We'll go back to the We'll go back to the dead area.

2680
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:13,760
There we go.

2681
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:22,460
Yay!

2682
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:32,300
Thank you guys for letting me indulge in my my Metal Gear brand ride a little bit.

2683
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,260
Just a little bit.

2684
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:34,880
Thanks for the weird tour!

2685
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,260
Have fun at Off-Kite in Japan!

2686
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:37,240
Thank you!

2687
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:38,200
Thank you for the off-kite!

2688
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:41,680
Thank you so much!

2689
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:42,120
Thank you!

2690
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,440
Wait, hold on.

2691
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:46,780
I'm going to unplug my other...

2692
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:49,480
I'm going to unplug my things now because...

2693
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:50,860
Thank you!

2694
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:53,860
This is pretty good!

2695
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:54,240
Yeah!

2696
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:55,420
I had so much fun!

2697
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:56,480
I hope you guys did too.

2698
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:58,220
I know that maybe it was...

2699
01:48:58,220 --> 01:49:00,920
If you don't know Metal Gear, maybe it was kind of whatever.

2700
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:03,100
But it was really cool.

2701
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:04,940
Just seeing... and then up there!

2702
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,960
Up right above is a snake!

2703
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:08,280
Plissken!

2704
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:09,280
It's right there!

2705
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:10,120
Thanks for the stream!

2706
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:10,560
Thank you!

2707
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,000
Thank you!

2708
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:12,280
Thank you!

2709
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:12,540
Thank you!

2710
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:14,800
Um...

2711
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:15,340
But yeah.

2712
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,600
So I'll be going to Off-Kite this weekend!

2713
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,780
And then right from after Off-Kite I'll be going to Japan!

2714
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:28,360
But I will be streaming in Japan as much as I can.

2715
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:31,520
Matara and I will be doing every other day.

2716
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:34,720
So she streams one day and then I stream the next day and then she streams the next day.

2717
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:35,580
You know.

2718
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:36,080
Whatever.

2719
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:37,380
Stream with so much fun!

2720
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:38,400
Have fun at Off-Kite!

2721
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:39,200
Thank you!

2722
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:40,400
Thank you!

2723
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:40,840
Thank you!

2724
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:44,020
Thank you for the tour of the facilities!

2725
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,940
Can't wait to see when you come back!

2726
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:46,860
Thank you so much!

2727
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:47,900
Thank you!

2728
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:48,740
I'll miss you guys!

2729
01:49:48,860 --> 01:49:57,060
Because I won't be able to see you guys so much since I'll be in Japan but we'll have so many stories and so many things to tell you about.

2730
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,700
So I'm very excited for that as well.

2731
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:04,120
And also whatever we're cooking while we're there.

2732
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:07,160
One wonder.

2733
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,140
I wonder what that could be.

2734
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:19,300
And then of course thank you Scuffford for making this fun low-poly model for me.

2735
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:20,600
And um...

2736
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:21,840
Yeah.

2737
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:27,720
I didn't expect to take so much time here at the Big Shell but it was fine.

2738
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:28,760
We went to McDonald's.

2739
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:29,240
We went to that.

2740
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:30,620
Rental... wait.

2741
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:33,680
It was like maid cafe, rental girl cafe.

2742
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:34,620
Fake me!

2743
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:36,080
Thanks for the Uncle Super!

2744
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:37,300
Thank you!

2745
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:39,220
Thank you!

2746
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:41,940
And um...

2747
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:42,580
Yeah.

2748
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:46,700
So you guys take care of yourself while I'm gone as well.

2749
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:50,100
I'm gonna move you downwards a little to my level.

2750
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:53,200
And um... yeah.

2751
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:54,960
Looking forward to it!

2752
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:55,580
Thank you!

2753
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:57,060
Thank you, thank you.

2754
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:00,040
Now I actually have to get to my meeting in 10 minutes.

2755
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:02,080
That is a legit and real meeting.

2756
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:03,440
I... I...

2757
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:03,660
I...

2758
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:15,700
Where are you guys?

2759
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:17,860
I'm back!

2760
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:18,840
I'm back!

2761
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:19,160
I'm back!

2762
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:19,520
I'm back!

2763
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:20,200
Don't worry!

2764
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:20,940
Don't worry!

2765
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:32,640
My very real...

2766
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:35,120
My very real meeting that I have to go to.

2767
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:36,920
That is not fake meeting.

2768
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:37,600
It's real.

2769
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:39,280
It's real and I remember when it is.

2770
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:40,360
It's...

2771
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:42,220
in 7 minutes.

2772
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:44,320
Enjoy Aftaya in Japan.

2773
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,360
Thank you!

2774
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,620
Thank you so much!

2775
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:47,380
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2776
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,280
And um...

2777
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:52,500
Um...

2778
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:54,520
Um... I don't know what else to say.

2779
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:56,460
Um...

2780
01:51:56,940 --> 01:51:58,180
Be good wisps.

2781
01:51:58,460 --> 01:51:58,900
Okay?

2782
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:02,540
Be good wisps while I'm gone since I won't see you.

2783
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:02,880
As much.

2784
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:03,940
But I will still be seeing you.

2785
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:05,240
Just not as much.

2786
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:06,700
And um...

2787
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:09,100
Thank you!

2788
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:10,200
I'm a...

2789
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,360
I'm a simp.

2790
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:14,440
And um...

2791
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:15,600
I don't know what else to say.

2792
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:15,960
Sorry.

2793
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:16,920
This is weird.

2794
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:19,240
I don't know how to end these kinds of things because I'm like so...

2795
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,680
Wiggly, wiggly, wiggly.

2796
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:25,160
So um...

2797
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,560
Uh... Can you end the stream that way?

2798
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:31,480
You got it!

2799
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:32,760
There we go.

2800
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:34,500
You got it!

2801
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:35,800
Bye everyone!

2802
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:37,340
Bye bye!

2803
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:38,100
Bye bye!

2804
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:38,380
Bye bye!

2805
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:39,560
See you when I get back!

2806
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:42,380
Or if I'm... Or if I say that off-guide...

2807
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:43,340
See you there!

2808
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:45,500
See you there!

2809
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:45,900
See you there!

2810
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:46,220
See you there!

2811
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:47,420
Bye bye!

2812
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:49,180
Boodoodoo!

2813
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,360
Boodoodoo!

2814
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:50,960
Doodoodoo!

2815
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:52,820
Boodoodoo!

2816
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:54,020
Boodoodoo!

2817
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:56,140
Boodoodoo!

2818
