590
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:47,250
So, yeah.

591
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,250
And taco Bell, it's different, it's different.

592
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,050
Different, no, not different.

593
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,030
What is different?

594
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,450
Smell or taste?

595
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,570
Taste or size?

596
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,290
Taste?

597
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:04,430
More deep or something different to taste?

598
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,130
Maybe.

599
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,230
Real...

600
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,490
Real Mexican food is better.

601
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,130
Real.

602
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:13,750
Real.

603
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:15,890
But...

604
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,330
Taco Bell is real, not real.

605
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:24,770
But America is not Mexico, just nearby.

606
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,490
Near, just near.

607
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:33,550
How, how, guys, how people can eat real Mexico food?

608
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,470
Maybe not Taco Bell.

609
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:42,550
If it's not Taco Bell, it's okay maybe.

610
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:43,990
Oh, okay.

611
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,070
Oh, okay.

612
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,690
Taco Bell, Taco Bell, Taco Bell.

613
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,650
Taco Bell, yummy.

614
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,490
Yeah, go to Mexico.

615
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,030
You can have a read.

616
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,310
Oh, that is a good idea.

617
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,390
Mexico, Mexico.

618
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:00,490
Mexico.

619
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,050
Mexico.

620
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:01,830
Mexico.

621
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,270
Okay, I understand.

622
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,290
Of course.

623
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:10,390
Well, sometimes I'm watching America TV show.

624
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,050
I think that time...

625
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:15,590
I mean,

626
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,550
like, you know, Dexter.

627
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,990
Dexter, you know?

628
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,030
Yeah, Dexter, you know?

629
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,090
Yeah, the serial killer.

630
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:27,590
Oh, okay.

631
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,270
That's why you think...

632
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,930
You think like...

633
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,610
Hi, Dexter.

634
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:49,110
Dexter, co-workers, I think, I remember Mexican, Mexican
people, many, and they using Mexico, Spanish?

635
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,350
Oh yeah, Spanish.

636
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:57,510
And they saying, say to Dexter, you're studying Spanish.

637
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:04,570
So, so, Spanish, just, Dexter for Dexter.

638
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,530
That's so developing.

639
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:10,670
And then so then, who for me, I had this Taco Bell
something.

640
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,470
Oh, yeah!

641
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:17,530
So I went, kind of like, so, the kind of thing that the
people is like this, or that kind of thing...

642
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:23,250
and like that kind of thing kind of So it's a little
different.

643
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,270
It's a little different, pretty different.

644
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:30,710
To my my image, Mexico people is in, the...

645
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,210
So different.

646
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,050

different.

00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,190
Yeah, yeah.

926
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:34,930
Main topic.

927
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:35,930
What are you?

928
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,570
What are we doing?

929
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:39,870
I'm confused.

930
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:40,670
I'm sorry.

931
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,730
But everybody must see, look.

932
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:44,770
Everybody look at the drawing.

933
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:49,210
what Ayami-sensei is bringing to Anime Central.

934
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:51,930
Ah, I really thank you.

935
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:56,330
Make sure you buy everything so she doesn't burn it in front
of the convention.

936
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:57,250
Yeah.

937
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:58,790
Yeah.

938
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:06,110
Well, if you guys don't need a campfire, buy it.

939
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:08,670
Buy it, please.

940
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:09,430

Please buy it.

944
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,390
Maybe...

945
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:21,410
Maybe this is a strange question.

946
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:27,270
But out of these books, Sensei, what is your recommendation?

947
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,670
Oh, that is...

948
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:34,370
That is really difficult question.

949
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:39,530

00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,110

00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:33,580

1021
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,060
Too...

1022
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,100
So, what do I mean...

1023
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:53,120
Because it's not like...

1024
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:53,420
I've never eaten it.

1025
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,900
Like, it's like...

1026
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,260
There's a lot of...

1027
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:56,820
This is really...

1028
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,920
It's like...

1029
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,780
Yeah, I guess.

1030
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,120
And, of course, it's like this kind of thing.

1031
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,440
Maybe it's too much for someone who's 100 years old.

1032
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1033
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:34,300

little not not good at not good yeah not good at not good

1036
01:00:50,020 --> 01:01:00,260
Yeah, I'm really, I mean, first time saw your design, I'm
really shocked color because mint color is, I think, really

1037
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:04,580
good color because I mean, never think about using mint
color.

1038
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,120
Really?

1039
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,960
Using drawing.

1040
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:12,800
And I mean, wow, there is really funny and interesting
color, I think.

1041
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,720
This is good mint.

1042
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:15,420
Good mint.

1043
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,760
Okay, okay.

1044
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,580
Because I never tried to using that color.

1045
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,760
This time I'm using mint color.

1046
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,700
I'm really excited.

1047
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,320
A lot of mint.

1048
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:28,120
Yeah.

1049
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,880

01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,080
Yes, I like mint.

1052
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,780
My idol Oshi, her color was mint.

1053
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,440
So I became mint.

1054
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,700
Yeah,

01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,420

I...

1071
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:40,260
Honestly, sometimes I think Mint, why you using your face
like that?

1072
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:42,180
No, don't hear me?

1073
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,280
Eh, don't.

1074
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:53,920
I think you so, you just, I think you just cute, but you
using your face something, something ugly or something funny

1075
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,140
and something so became...

1076
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:58,580
like...

1077
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:58,800
like...

1078
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,980
like...

1079
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:08,140
sometimes I think there is...

1080
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:08,860
there is mint?

1081
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,220
What the face?

1082
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,240
what the...

1083
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,220
what the face?

1084
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:18,580
everything cute but I think...

1085
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:25,860
so-so now that emoji like that, that comment that kind of...

1086
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,740
Yes, yes, comments.

1087
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:43,600
Because I'm thinking about cute girls or, how do you say, I
mean, I think about cute girls or, I mean, I think.

1088
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:52,800
Oh, Minto-chan is a little more interesting, I use my face,
or I use my face, I'm not a gay-nine-nine-nine, you're a

1089
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,260
gay-nine, I'm not a comedian.

1090
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,320
I did comedy on me too.

1091
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,280
Yes, yes.

1092
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,400
It's because...

1093
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,580
Maybe if you try to be cute, it's too much pressure.

1094
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,220
Pressure is too much.

1095
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,340
Why?

1096
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:11,760
It's just cute.

1097
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:12,900
It's not.

1098
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,040
What?

1099
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:15,680

something cute or wink or something

1123
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:48,500
