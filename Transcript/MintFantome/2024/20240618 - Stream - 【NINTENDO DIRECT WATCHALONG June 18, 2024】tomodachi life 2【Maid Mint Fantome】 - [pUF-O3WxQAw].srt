1
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,460
Good morning, every-nyang.

2
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,400
Good morning.

3
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,660
Hello.

4
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,420
Hold on, I'm trying to fix my...

5
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,260
I'm trying to fix the window capture.

6
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,980
It looks so ugly.

7
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,240
Why is it...

8
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,380
Since when did...

9
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,300
Wait a second.

10
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,320
Since when did YouTube videos not...

11
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,280
Why is it not a perfect square?

12
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,040
Since when were the YouTube videos curved?

13
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,500
Maybe it's fine.

14
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,620
I'll get smaller once it starts.

15
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,440
Move your head.

16
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,700
It hasn't started yet!

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,240
I'll move my head once it starts.

18
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,540
Gosh.

19
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,940
It's been like that for a while.

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,940
Oh my god.

21
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,420
I didn't even notice.

22
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,340
Big head in the way.

23
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,220
I'll move my head.

24
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,400
I'll move my head once it starts.

25
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,720
I'll move my head once it starts.

26
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,820
Good morning, everybody.

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
Did I say it already?

28
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,120
Hello.

29
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm awake.

30
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,420
I'm a little sick.

31
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,820
I'm hoping for Tomodachi Life 2.

32
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
That's all that I have to say.

33
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,580
I'm gonna turn on the sound.

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,080
Let's put on some music until it begins.

35
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,060
There might be like overlapping BGM.

36
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,740
But that's okay.

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,060
That's okay.

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,600
What time is it?

39
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,580
Oh, we still have four minutes.

40
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:37,880
Yeah.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,960
Let's put on a little bit so it's not just silence.

42
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,160
Because I'm just sitting here in silence.

43
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,450
Tomodachi Life 2.

44
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,390
Your head's not in the way.

45
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,110
It's huge though.

46
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,650
Stop making fun of my head.

47
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,770
It holds lots of secrets, okay?

48
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,190
I'm trying to set up.

49
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,530
I just got on my computer like just now.

50
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,510
Okay, I have it open.

51
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,190
As you can see, I have the direct open.

52
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,290
You'll be able to hear it and watch it.

53
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:31,110
So if you have it open yourself, you can close it now.

54
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,930
I'm just kidding.

55
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,110
Unless you want.

56
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:35,370
Oops.

57
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,230
Let me move it over a little bit too.

58
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,050
Here.

59
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,470
We'll have it like a TV in the maid cafe.

60
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,230
Hell yeah.

61
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,250
Hell yeah.

62
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,970
Oh, you know secrets?

63
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,050
Name all of them.

64
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,690
Secret one, secret two, secret three, secret four, secret five, secret six.

65
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,750
I caught him in stream.

66
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,190
Yippee.

67
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:01,850
Yippee.

68
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:02,850
Yippee.

69
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,350
Yippee.

70
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,550
I forgot I remembered while you were offline one day.

71
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,410
Well, thank you.

72
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,290
Appreciate you sticking around.

73
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,670
I mean, I was going to say, please don't I remember.

74
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,870
Now that you remembered.

75
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,330
Now that you re-membered.

76
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,730
But like you remember, but like you remembered.

77
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,410
Words are hard.

78
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,150
Oh gosh, I'm so tired.

79
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,650
I just woke up like 10 minutes ago.

80
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,630
Wow.

81
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,190
What are you guys hoping for?

82
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,290
What is your hopes and your dreams, everybody?

83
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:43,670
I saw a lot of Silksong, which we're all on that hard copium, aren't we?

84
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,110
Who here just woke up?

85
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:45,630
Me.

86
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,470
Fire Emblem.

87
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,450
Tomodachi Life.

88
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,330
Xenoblade.

89
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:51,490
Silksong.

90
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,770
Tomodachi Life.

91
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,630
Ride or die, baby.

92
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,950
I mean, I'm already dead.

93
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,910
Ace Combat.

94
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,790
I think Vince is a member of the Lali Lule Lo.

95
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,090
No.

96
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,170
No.

97
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,730
I hope they announce a game called Mint Phantom Super meets Super Mario.

98
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,590
I'm tired.

99
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:12,990
That's me right now.

100
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,550
I have no expectations.

101
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,710
I know nothing.

102
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,390
I'm just here for a good time.

103
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,890
Feet to where your head is huge.

104
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,010
Can we not?

105
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,750
Welcome to the Silksong disappointment area.

106
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,650
Nintendo Direct.

107
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,330
How much time?

108
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,670
Oh, one minute left, everybody.

109
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,430
One minute left.

110
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,030
Metal Gear Solid 6.

111
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,330
Only on the Switch.

112
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,810
Yeah, that's what they'll announce today.

113
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:50,850
100%.

114
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,210
I know.

115
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,450
It was leaked to me and my brain.

116
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,490
The aliens.

117
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,270
They beamed it directly in.

118
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,090
First stream after finding you from Clips.

119
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,610
Oh my gosh.

120
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,230
Thank you.

121
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,170
I know you watch Vinny, but have you seen him?

122
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,070
I mean Joel watching YouTube vids of some of your ghost cousins.

123
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,650
Joel?

124
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,250
Like, I don't think so.

125
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,870
Joel.

126
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,090
Joel.

127
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,470
I have not.

128
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,330
My ghost cousins.

129
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,670
Oh my god.

130
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,110
That's my alarm.

131
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,490
Shut up.

132
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:28,790
Shut up.

133
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,170
When I think of Joel, I think of him.

134
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,710
Joel, I think I have Joel... What's his name?

135
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,650
Joel Haver or whatever.

136
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,750
He always makes funny skits, so I watch his channel.

137
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,890
Turn off the sound!

138
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,070
Oh my god, it's kinda loud.

139
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,350
Yippee!

140
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,150
Let's go!

141
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,650
Nintendo Direct, baby!

142
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,980
Princess Peach!

143
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,260
Luigi!

144
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,260
Did he just speak?

145
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,440
No, no, no, no, no.

146
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,980
No, no, no, no, no, no.

147
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,800
Luigi game!

148
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,540
Wait, is this... this is...

149
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,900
Is this new Mario voice?

150
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,340
But it doesn't sound so new.

151
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,040
Mario and Luigi!

152
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,800
Yahoo!

153
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,260
Yahoo!

154
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,760
Mario and Luigi!

155
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,280
Oh my gosh, look at them spin.

156
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,140
Spinning in tandem.

157
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,500
Wow, look at him go!

158
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,480
Oh my god, so cute!

159
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,840
Connie!

160
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,180
Too cute.

161
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,030
Wait.

162
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,510
Wait.

163
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,170
Okay.

164
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:26,860
I feel less... less self-conscious reacting because before in the past, if I had to do a watch-along, I had no audio.

165
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,620
It was just me talking.

166
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,640
And so now it's not just me in silence.

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,480
Wow, Peach!

168
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,660
You can't both be in love with Peach.

169
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,680
That's weird.

170
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,380
Connie's so cute.

171
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,630
Mario and Luigi...

172
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,170
Brothership!

173
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,100
Hello, everyone.

174
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,840
I'm Shinya Takahashi, and I'll be your guide for today's Nintendo Direct.

175
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,700
That was the first new entry in the Mario and Luigi series in almost nine years.

176
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,540
No way!

177
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,480
Mario and Luigi Brothership.

178
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,920
Maybe they should have rethought the name.

179
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:34,640
Please look forward to a seafaring adventure that unfolds across mysterious islands, as well as evolved bros moves with Mario and Luigi.

180
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,840
Bros moves.

181
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,340
Okay, let's see the first batch of highlights.

182
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:39,360
Oh, I'm crying.

183
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,740
You know what's so funny is on the side, like under the recommended for me, five years ago, Silksong announcement trailer.

184
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,540
The thrill of the Nintendo World Championships is heading to the Nintendo Switch system.

185
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:51,880
Oh.

186
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,620
The thrill!

187
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,000
Take on over 150 speedrunning challenges from across 13 NES games.

188
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,520
From lightning-fast beats to action-packed battles.

189
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,880
Poppin' wheelies!

190
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,520
Familiarize yourself with each challenge and perfect your timing.

191
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,280
Then give it your best shot and aim for the top of the online leaderboards.

192
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,640
Oh, no.

193
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,500
You'll see Minthe Phantom on there.

194
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,800
It'll be an imposter.

195
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,760
Like completing Super Mario Brothers in one go.

196
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,020
Using warp pipes.

197
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,780
Stuck on a legend challenge?

198
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,180
Check out classified information for handy tips and tricks to help you improve.

199
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,420
It looks like retro.

200
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,520
Like even the guide.

201
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,480
Where you'll race against ghost data of players worldwide.

202
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,220
Back to the trail, half of the players will be eliminated.

203
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,720
You've only got one shot to survive.

204
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,360
Will you be the last one standing?

205
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,540
Nintendo World Championships NES Edition.

206
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,520
Launches on Nintendo Switch July 18th.

207
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,740
It's literally a speedrunning game.

208
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,520
Pre -orders for the digital version are available now on Nintendo Wii Shop.

209
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,260
A deluxe set containing a physical version of the game and other bonus items is also available for pre-order.

210
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,640
Wow!

211
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,700
Oh my gosh, the collector set.

212
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,580
The final battle of Fairy Tail is about to begin.

213
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,620
Fairy Tail?

214
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,140
One more time!

215
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,640
Happy!

216
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,760
Oh my god, Rie Kugumiya!

217
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,800
Relive the climactic Alvarez Empire arc.

218
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,760
An anime fairy tale in this action RPG.

219
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,060
What?

220
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,480
Set in the vast kingdom of Fiore, Team Natsu prepares to finish their fight.

221
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,680
I was gonna say, this isn't a Warriors-type game, is it?

222
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,700
Koei Tetsuo.

223
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,900
Fairy Tail 2.

224
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,080
Oh, I like her.

225
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,580
I don't remember her name though.

226
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,980
The red-haired girl.

227
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,480
Oh...

228
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,280
It starts with an E, right?

229
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,080
Erza.

230
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,980
Fairy Tail 2!

231
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,400
Anime!

232
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,640
The Icarus Uprising remaster, let's go.

233
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,220
So, Final Fantasy.

234
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,360
Final Fantasy.

235
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,640
FANTAZION!?

236
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,360
Final Fantasy?

237
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:23,780
Wow.

238
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,080
To restore his memories, Leo must confront an evil entity threatening all mankind.

239
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:29,640
There's eggs everywhere.

240
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:29,840
Vincent?

241
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,220
HAHAHA!

242
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,860
So, skills are the ticket to winning battles.

243
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,380
Nier Fantasies.

244
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,440
Yeah, looks like...

245
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,500
I thought Nier at first too.

246
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,780
Adjust a speed trajectory to target multiple enemies at once.

247
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,060
Come on, N каждый!

248
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,180
You can also send enemies you've encountered to a separate dimension and fight them later.

249
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,280
Is that how you spell dimension?

250
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,500
It's not a dimension, it's a Dimension.

251
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,660
Not the Dimension, though.

252
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,870
The Dimension Dungeon.

253
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,190
I still haven't played this though.

254
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,190
BEEBALL!

255
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,390
Sorry.

256
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,030
Just watching the lady so casually dribbling.

257
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,830
So funny.

258
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,790
Yeah!

259
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,310
Shoot, lady!

260
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:49,910
Keep going!

261
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:50,430
Woo!

262
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,770
You're killing it!

263
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,650
Oh no.

264
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,490
I can feel myself raging from that already.

265
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,490
She shoots!

266
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,110
She scores!

267
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,730
Swish swish, baby.

268
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,930
Alright.

269
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,530
We ballin'.

270
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,390
We ballin', Minto!

271
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,780
Men could never be ballin' like this.

272
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,280
Shut the heck up.

273
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,920
I was in basketball before.

274
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,140
Woah.

275
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,500
What is this?

276
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,380
But it looks kind of like...

277
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,180
The music is nice.

278
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,960
I like it.

279
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,440
It's one ugly looking thing.

280
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,380
I think it's kinda cute!

281
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,540
It's like...

282
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,680
It's got some nice hair.

283
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:21,740
Mio!

284
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,720
Memories in orbit.

285
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,820
What?

286
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,420
That's it?

287
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,520
We're just not gonna address that.

288
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,840
We're just gonna...

289
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,560
Everybody, we didn't even watch that.

290
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,360
That was a fever dream.

291
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,180
Dios mio.

292
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,540
Disney game.

293
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,300
What?

294
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,440
What big secret lies at the end?

295
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,860
Start sleuthing, because this free update launches on Nintendo Switch later today.

296
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,200
Okay.

297
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,180
Cool.

298
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,180
Hello kitty!

299
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,480
Where's my baby?

300
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,780
Where is he?

301
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Where is he?

302
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,260
I'm scanning everywhere.

303
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,460
Where is he?

304
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,660
Customize your character.

305
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,460
Oh my god, stop.

306
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,860
So cute.

307
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,060
I love not Animal Crossing.

308
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,580
Let's go!

309
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,580
There he is!

310
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,340
And that is the main adventure in this open world adventure.

311
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,400
Son of a...

312
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,380
You must leave this house to solve mysteries and restore Friendship Island when...

313
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:19,420
Where is he?

314
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,700
Hello Kitty Island Adventure launches as a timed console exclusive...

315
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,120
Oh my god!

316
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,980
Why are they...

317
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,420
Look how tiny he is!

318
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,380
Oh god, he's so small!

319
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,840
Let's get loony in this wacky sports game.

320
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,340
What?

321
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:42,540
Play as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and more across four arcade-style sports.

322
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,180
Unleash the...

323
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,800
We are balling today.

324
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,200
What is going on?

325
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,900
But watch out for falling anvils.

326
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,780
Looney Tunes wacky world sports...

327
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,060
What is this Space Jam?

328
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,740
Nintendo Switch this fall.

329
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,900
But it's not Space Jam.

330
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,420
That's all, folks.

331
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,160
Let's see if you can beat me in Game On.

332
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,400
Why does he sound like he's stuck in a...

333
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,180
Oh no.

334
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,040
New crewmate and imposter roles are being added to Among Us.

335
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,400
Phantom?

336
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,140
Excuse me, where's my royalties?

337
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,340
Plan tracking devices on others as a tracker.

338
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,540
Or turn invisible while taking out players...

339
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:18,840
What?

340
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,800
Suss things out when this free update for Among Us sneaks onto Nintendo Switch later today.

341
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,940
Wait, but it's only for the Switch?

342
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,620
It's only for the Switch?

343
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,120
This is Felicidad.

344
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,000
Felicidad!

345
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,340
Those who command and raise them are called Farmagia and play a vital role in the land...

346
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,300
It looks... is this the artist for Fairy Tail?

347
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,420
A farmagia must rise up against the oppressive magus...

348
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,760
To stop his vicious reign of the underworld.

349
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,080
Raise monsters and lead them into the fight against the magus' army.

350
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,160
Plant seeds...

351
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,860
Then cultivate them...

352
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,520
And harvest them to make your buddies come to life.

353
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,360
I'm growing dogs?

354
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,120
What is going on?

355
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,600
Make them then be trained for battle.

356
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,940
Fairy Tail 3, let's go!

357
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,440
Oh my god, look at this whole army!

358
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,180
It's like Pikmin-esque.

359
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,280
Weaknesses in action-packed combat.

360
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,800
Felicidad has blessed you!

361
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,700
To call forth a giant fusion summon.

362
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,780
And wreak havoc on your foes.

363
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,480
A horse is just standing still.

364
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,460
What is going on?

365
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,280
What is going on?

366
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,340
In Farmagia...

367
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:39,800
The Magus.

368
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,940
Launching on Nintendo Switch November 1st.

369
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,460
Farmagia.

370
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,160
The Magus.

371
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,960
Ok, cool.

372
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,020
Donkey Kong!

373
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,320
DK!

374
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,960
DK!

375
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,240
Punch him in the face!

376
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,440
It looks good.

377
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,040
It's kind of like triggering me though that they weren't like taking out all the...

378
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,120
Oh my gosh, it looks so cool!

379
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,600
They weren't taking out all the spikes, you know?

380
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,900
They weren't clearing it out.

381
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,480
Should have cleaned it up.

382
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,780
The original version had some awful motion controls.

383
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,740
I mean, that's just the Wii, right?

384
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,040
Monkey!

385
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,580
Monkey!

386
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,400
Monkey!

387
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,860
One of Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong's jungle escapades returns in HD.

388
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,060
Plenty of wild actions and antics are in store with these Kongs.

389
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,240
Plenty of wild actions and antics are in store with these Kongs.

390
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,300
Plenty of wild actions and antics are in store with these Kongs.

391
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,640
Look at this little Nintendo hat.

392
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,060
Jungle.

393
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,260
The time is nigh.

394
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,060
I thought it was Zelda for a second.

395
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,090
Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra!

396
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,470
Wow, thank you for your service.

397
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,800
Dragon Quest?

398
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,880
Wait, it's actually Dragon Quest?

399
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,840
That's why I wouldn't know.

400
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,980
Journey with allies.

401
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,500
To face the Archfiend.

402
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,580
On an epic adventure.

403
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,840
Dragon Quest makes me so sad now though.

404
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,720
Memorable encounters.

405
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,860
It looks good though.

406
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,180
It looks really good.

407
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:20,680
Perplexing challenges.

408
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:26,400
And formidable monsters await.

409
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,080
And formidable monsters await.

410
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,200
Wow!

411
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,940
Iconic RPG.

412
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,980
Remade in HD 2D.

413
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,020
HD 2D is such a funny...

414
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,460
HD 2D is such a funny...

415
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,920
It looks so like...

416
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,720
The sprites look so fluent.

417
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,380
Forge your own path.

418
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,600
Go share the experience with your friends.

419
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:43,920
Go share the experience with your friends.

420
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,220
The legacy begins.

421
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,180
What's a good Dragon Quest to start?

422
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,760
Dragon Quest 3.

423
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,120
HD 2D Remake.

424
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,220
Coming to Nintendo Switch November 14th.

425
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,240
Coming to Nintendo Switch November 14th.

426
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,400
Coming to Nintendo Switch November 14th.

427
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,860
None of them.

428
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,160
Stop!

429
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,180
Eleven.

430
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,580
Eight.

431
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:16,880
Eleven.

432
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,680
I saw someone say three.

433
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,620
Oh?

434
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,520
Oh my god!

435
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,060
They totally bait and switched us!

436
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,760
It's all three of them!

437
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:38,940
Nintendo.

438
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,680
Hello.

439
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,880
Hello.

440
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,860
Cute.

441
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,760
So cute.

442
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,680
This is where the fun part starts.

443
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,140
One day, we're going to be in a place...

444
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,900
where we can praise our power.

445
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,540
The power of...

446
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:11,660
the having it!

447
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,180
You know, The power of the darkness!

448
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,220
The power of light.

449
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,660
You know what?

450
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,160
It is not very long at all...

451
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,040
but I'm going to do my best.

452
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,100
Yes!

453
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,740
Interesting.

454
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,500
Awww, thank you!

455
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,900
Three, one, and two in that order is what he said.

456
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,740
ViviCore, thanks for the five giftings!

457
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,740
Like Metal Gear...

458
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,280
No...

459
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,160
No...

460
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,540
What is going on?

461
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,420
Oh my god!

462
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,620
This is a game to rival Fortnite!

463
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,540
No way!

464
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,220
Oh my god!

465
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,180
Oh my god, no!

466
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,700
Oh my god!

467
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,140
Is that Chucky?

468
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,720
Oh my god!

469
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,540
Oh my god!

470
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,880
Spooky silly!

471
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,580
I love spooky!

472
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,700
Okay, spooky?

473
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,580
Spooky!

474
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:43,680
Spooky!

475
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,520
It's Luigi!

476
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,340
Hello?

477
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,640
Hello?

478
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,580
Hello?

479
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,580
Goofy ghosts!

480
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,460
Excuse me!

481
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,020
I don't like this game.

482
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,740
I'm feeling targeted right now.

483
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,620
Luigi's Mansion 2 HD!

484
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,040
Lots of Luigi today!

485
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,560
You pervert!

486
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,180
Luigi!

487
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,100
Why would you scream?

488
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,380
Dream, you're the one who...

489
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,360
Dempaman?

490
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,620
What?

491
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,020
Dempaman?

492
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,940
Local co-op.

493
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,540
Local co-op.

494
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,180
Free?

495
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:44,980
Okay.

496
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,100
I'm setting my July.

497
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,240
Dang, it's June.

498
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,320
What?

499
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,780
Oh no, tower defense.

500
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,100
Oh no.

501
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,740
Oh no, tower defense.

502
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,420
Tower defense with anime movies.

503
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,020
And tactical tussles.

504
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,300
Metal slug tower defense.

505
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
You can also slug it out with other players in online battles.

506
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,440
Uh oh.

507
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,600
Metal slug attack reloaded.

508
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,920
Storms onto the Nintendo Switch system later today.

509
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,760
Oh no.

510
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,680
Uh oh.

511
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,440
Embark on an expedition of the damned in this eagerly awaited sequel to the Gothic roguelike RPG.

512
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,200
Oh, Darkest Dungeon 2.

513
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,300
Board your stagecoach and set off across...

514
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,520
I've never played Darkest Dungeon though.

515
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,780
...to prevent an apocalypse.

516
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,000
Fight off nightmarish fiends in turn-based combat.

517
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,440
And upgrade your abilities after each deadly run.

518
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,540
Darkest Dungeon 2 launches on Nintendo Switch July 15.

519
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:49,780
Hello.

520
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,000
Hello, Solidus.

521
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,840
Viewers begin later today on Nintendo eShop.

522
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,640
More classic titles are on the way.

523
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,620
Plus expansion packs.

524
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,160
Oh!

525
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,660
Play Link's classic 16-bit adventure.

526
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,740
And team up online to explore randomized dungeons in The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past Four Swords.

527
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,040
I've never played Four Swords though.

528
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,600
I didn't have anyone to play it with.

529
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,740
Experience the remake of Samus' first adventure in Metroid Zero Mission.

530
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,240
Yeah!

531
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,620
Coming to the new Nintendo 64...

532
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:28,940
Switch.

533
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,200
...Nintendo Switch Online...

534
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,520
Mature.

535
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:30,700
Sure.

536
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,380
...17 -plus collection of games.

537
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,040
Mature.

538
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,860
Brave the dangerous lost land to stop the campaigners...

539
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,000
We were just talking about this game!

540
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,220
No way!

541
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,320
And...

542
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,880
Perfect Dark.

543
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,740
...to end their alien conspiracy in...

544
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,080
Perfect Dark.

545
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,140
Now with online multiplayer.

546
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,780
I feel so targeted right now.

547
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,620
All four games will be available for Nintendo Switch Online...

548
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,100
Let's go!

549
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,400
...fantasy pack members later today.

550
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,600
I've been wanting to play Perfect Dark though for a while, so...

551
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,680
Set sail to save the day.

552
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,320
This guy...

553
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,420
This is Verona, a young woman with the ability to communicate with phantoms.

554
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,480
I will take all of this girl.

555
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,760
I will take all of this girl.

556
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,420
You sure now...

557
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:39,540
You are so cute.

558
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,520
I am an acquaintance of Zeyu.

559
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,540
So, from now on...

560
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:55,120
...to see Vanilla's aqualindre.

561
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,940
Even though I can't move her now...

562
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,140
...I can't move her now.

563
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,160
I am an acquaintance of Zeyu...

564
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,280
That's good.

565
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,260
You are still the best friend I had in the AM.

566
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,900
...you are still...

567
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,620
I never get into Disgaea because of that.

568
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,340
Or anything.

569
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,080
I'm just not a huge fan of turn-based stuff.

570
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,860
Which seems like it's totally my...

571
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,200
Oh my god.

572
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,640
Stop, they're so cute.

573
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,960
So cute!

574
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,820
Lots of Phantom stuff today too!

575
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,060
This is my Direct!

576
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,720
This is...

577
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,300
Oh no...

578
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,580
Oh no, what are we doing with Street Fighter?

579
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:32,900
Oh!

580
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,660
Wow!

581
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,580
That's a lot of games!

582
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,560
Fun!

583
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,380
The Punisher!

584
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:00,860
Oh wow!

585
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,260
Oh no!

586
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,960
Captain America is getting his eyes wiped!

587
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,920
Oh, that's cool!

588
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,620
I love stuff like that!

589
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,260
Oh, funky!

590
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:23,440
Funky!

591
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,800
Hold on, I'm gonna grab some tissues.

592
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,370
Oh no!

593
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,350
Oh no!

594
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,650
Oh no!

595
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:38,990
What?

596
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:39,930
Oh no.

597
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,790
Uh oh.

598
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:44,710
No.

599
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,670
Oh no.

600
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,070
Oh no.

601
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,930
A Super Mario Party Jamboree!

602
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,030
Oh no.

603
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,470
Oh no.

604
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,490
Oh no!

605
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,810
Oh no!

606
00:30:59,170 --> 00:30:59,750
Oh no!

607
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,150
COCONUT MOLE!

608
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,650
Rainbow Galleria.

609
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,670
Oh my god.

610
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,890
Could other people...

611
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,090
Who was that guy that took the star?

612
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,730
Goomba Lagoon!

613
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,230
Goomba Lagoon!

614
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,950
Oh my god, Luigi's about to die.

615
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,910
Oh, just kidding.

616
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,450
Oh god, no.

617
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,130
Oh!

618
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,090
Oh, look at all the boos and the...

619
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,510
Oh, the chain jump's so cute.

620
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,630
Oh god.

621
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,730
Battle of wits.

622
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:49,970
Okay.

623
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,370
Oh god.

624
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,490
Oh god.

625
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,030
There's a lot of people.

626
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,850
20 people!

627
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,130
This is too chaotic.

628
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,390
No way.

629
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,750
20 people!

630
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,010
That's too many!

631
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,090
Are you kidding me right now?

632
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,470
Oh my god.

633
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,670
Oh my god.

634
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:38,610
This is so much fun.

635
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:40,690
I can't wait to see this.

636
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:40,850
Let me see...

637
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,510
How many times do I have to say this?

638
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:45,330
20 times!

639
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:45,670
I can't wait.

640
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,510
20 times!

641
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,330
I can't wait.

642
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,410
How many times do I have to say this?

643
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,650
I can't do it.

644
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,110
I can't do it.

645
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,310
I can't.

646
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,690
This is going to be fun, but the games are probably too long, right?

647
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,230
Like, for it to be with viewers.

648
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,590
Zelda?

649
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,070
New Zel- wait.

650
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,310
Not new Zelda, but...

651
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:28,110
If it's a new 2D Zelda, though...

652
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,120
Oh my god!

653
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,060
It's like a...

654
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,400
I'll kill you next time!

655
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:42,620
Wait...

656
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,440
Actual Zelda game?

657
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,500
Actual Zelda game?

658
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,520
Wait, actual Zelda game?

659
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,000
No way...

660
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,980
Zelda Zelda game?

661
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,760
No way...

662
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,280
No way...

663
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,480
This is the year of the ladies, everybody!

664
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,960
First we get Peach...

665
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,040
And then we get Zelda Zelda!

666
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,200
They're gonna call it Link.

667
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:22,220
I love the little, like, dead Link on his shirt.

668
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,800
I love 2D Zelda!

669
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,260
Does this count as 2D Zelda?

670
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,620
It's like a little 3D.

671
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,300
Zelda real!

672
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,340
Okay...

673
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,300
HD 2D.

674
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,140
Yes, I'm very curious.

675
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,940
This is the last lands of Hyrule.

676
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,160
Strange rifts have appeared.

677
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,840
And have taken many people.

678
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,580
Oh my god!

679
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,700
Including Link.

680
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,680
Bye, Link.

681
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,620
Now, alone, Zelda meets the fairy, Tri.

682
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,700
Receives a mysterious staff called the Tri-Rod.

683
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,300
And sets off on a journey across Hyrule to save her kingdom.

684
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,200
Just try harder, Zelda!

685
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:27,160
By waving the Tri-Rod at a table she found, Zelda learned how to create an imitation of it, called an Echo.

686
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,840
Okay.

687
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,320
Once you learn an echo of something, you can recreate it whenever you'd like.

688
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:32,920
Oh, neat!

689
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:38,540
Even if there's a wall blocking your path, you can create echoes of tables to get a leg up.

690
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,820
Just like that.

691
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,260
Oh, cool!

692
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,560
You can create wooden boxes.

693
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,240
Old beds.

694
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,220
I can make a box!

695
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,960
And a bed!

696
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,180
How you use them separately or together is entirely up to you.

697
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,720
Oh my god, it's a Minecraft water tower.

698
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,140
Learn and create echoes of something.

699
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,200
You can create echoes of things you find while exploring Hyrule.

700
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,300
Whoa!

701
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,020
You might be surprised at what you discover.

702
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,060
There's so many combinations you can do.

703
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,780
What?

704
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,520
That's kind of cool!

705
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,160
Even battles will look different.

706
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,600
You could pick up and throw a rock echo, for example.

707
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,560
Oh damn!

708
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,260
That's not all, though.

709
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,700
You can also create echoes of monsters.

710
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,580
Oh my god, there was like a little tiny version of a...

711
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,200
After doing so, they'll bite by your side.

712
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:23,800
What?

713
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,020
Monsters have different abilities.

714
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,960
But what does it cost, right?

715
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,680
To choose the one you want to create, based on the situation.

716
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,320
Wisdom is key after all.

717
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,180
What does it cost to summon something?

718
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,960
Whoa!

719
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,230
Interesting.

720
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,650
I think it would still take me...

721
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,450
It would take me a minute to get used to this.

722
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,150
A Hyrule without Link?

723
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,290
The fate of the kingdom is now in your hands.

724
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,170
Oh my god!

725
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:55,750
The fate of the kingdom is now in your hands.

726
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,310
How was that?

727
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,790
How was that?

728
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,790
I hope you enjoyed this demonstration of the echo video...

729
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,690
That looks so fun, though.

730
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,410
...which channels Princess Zelda's wisdom.

731
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,250
They create deco trees, huh?

732
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,670
To be honest, I haven't...

733
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,330
They even have the little spiky guys!

734
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,710
How you solve puzzles and battle enemies will change depending on the echoes used.

735
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:22,550
In short, we've created a game where each player's experience will be different.

736
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,970
Yeah, everybody can...

737
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,730
You can play as you want!

738
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,510
The Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom launches September 26th.

739
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,230
That's so fun!

740
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:35,710
A Nintendo Switch Lite system inspired by the Legend of Zelda series will also be available at launch.

741
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,890
Oh, it's pretty!

742
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,150
Isn't this just the Necromancer monkey?

743
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:46,190
Now, I'd like to return this moment I'd stolen away back to Mr. Takahashi.

744
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,190
Thank you, Mr. Aonuma.

745
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,230
How could you say that you stole it away?

746
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,030
You're Mr. Aonuma!

747
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:55,970
Aonuma-sama!

748
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:57,770
You're so legendary.

749
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,790
More headlines?

750
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:02,630
Is that what he said?

751
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,370
Uh-oh.

752
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,050
Sorry, I have to turn off the audio for this.

753
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,570
I don't want to get copyright struck.

754
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:11,890
Sorry.

755
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,190
It's K-pop, I think.

756
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,710
That looks like Lady Gaga.

757
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,350
Hot new tracks!

758
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,810
Ariana Grande!

759
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,270
See ya!

760
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,790
Green Day?

761
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,770
Oh yeah, there's Lady Gaga.

762
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,290
Oh, cool.

763
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,570
I've never played, actually, one of these games before.

764
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,150
But I've... have you guys...

765
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,130
Did you guys know that these are, like, real people?

766
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,970
That they just put in this makeup...

767
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,870
And then, like, put a filter on top?

768
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,850
Like, there's people...

769
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,070
The people that are dancing...

770
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:01,310
Actually...

771
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,590
Like, look like that.

772
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,510
They have, like, a bunch of face makeup and stuff on.

773
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,390
Oh, okay, we're good.

774
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:08,930
Lego!

775
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:15,170
I'm very curious about the Green Day dances.

776
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:20,610
Oh.

777
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:21,450
What?

778
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:22,670
Okay.

779
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:24,950
You're gonna climb up onto the cauldrons...

780
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,930
Climb up onto Tallnecks...

781
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,490
And traverse other locations inspired by the original game.

782
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:30,910
What?

783
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:31,830
But be careful.

784
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,430
Swarms of machines are lurking everywhere.

785
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,230
Okay.

786
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:40,110
Use an array of gadgets like blast boots and gravity bombs to hunt them down.

787
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:40,990
I never played the...

788
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,690
What was the game?

789
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,450
From the Nimble Watchers...

790
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,950
To Mighty Sawtooth.

791
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,150
Horizon...

792
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,750
What was it called?

793
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,090
You might even come across the fearsome Thunderjaw.

794
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,550
Oh, just Horizon?

795
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,390
As you progress, you can help Aloy rebuild your home.

796
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:53,890
Oh my god, cute.

797
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:54,110
I love this.

798
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,310
Hot dog!

799
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:04,670
Okay.

800
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,170
Interesting.

801
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,530
No, I saw a hot dog.

802
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,310
I saw it for real.

803
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:18,690
Stray!

804
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,110
This is another game I wanted to play, but didn't...

805
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,170
have a chance to.

806
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,490
Oh my god, little baby!

807
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,270
Oh no!

808
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,770
Don't just stand...

809
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,590
Oh my god, Simba!

810
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:39,970
My scar!

811
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:42,730
Mufasa!

812
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,730
Wait, was this not on the Switch before?

813
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,290
Lord, live the game.

814
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:09,570
So it was only PS4?

815
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,330
Oh, okay.

816
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,190
I'm just a cat!

817
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,330
I'm just a cat!

818
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,510
I'm just a cat!

819
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,090
I'm just a cat!

820
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:24,230
Crazy.

821
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,330
Oh, okay, okay.

822
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,390
Oh, okay.

823
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:35,630
Neat!

824
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:39,930
Rude!

825
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:44,330
I know I'm short, but come on!

826
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:46,930
Hahaha!

827
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,290
Hahaha!

828
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,150
Hahaha!

829
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,350
Hahaha!

830
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:50,750
I'll always be yours!

831
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:51,550
Hahaha!

832
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,430
I'll always be yours!

833
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,030
I'll always be yours!

834
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:54,710
Hahaha!

835
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,430
Animal Crossing Hobbit style!

836
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,950
There's a new color to the little haven of fire!

837
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,330
There's a new color to the little haven of fire!

838
00:41:59,490 --> 00:41:59,910
There's a new color to the little haven of fire!

839
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:04,990
You'll befriend your neighbors, work together to solve problems, and even share a meal!

840
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,170
It's more, harder, fish, porridge, and cook!

841
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,970
I love how any time it's like customize your house, it's just like Animal Crossing!

842
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:15,550
The best way to build a Hobbit community is by hosting a dinner party with your homemade dishes!

843
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,110
Wow!

844
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,210
I can poison everybody!

845
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,330
Plus, you can threaten your neighbors for unique decorations or special interests.

846
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,170
Gandalf?

847
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,030
A Lord Of The Rings TM Game.

848
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,070
A Lord...

849
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,290
AAAAAAAAAAAA!

850
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,450
AAAAAAAAA!

851
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:47,770
No way!

852
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:57,850
As the Prolific Prosecutor miles up, take the case out of the courtroom and investigate crime scenes.

853
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:01,690
Check for information by interviewing people and inspecting evidence.

854
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:02,790
Let's go!

855
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,170
We can say we're scared!

856
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,410
Yeah!

857
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:12,410
Enjoy all new, hand-drawn character visuals from the original series' character designer.

858
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,670
Or swap to the original sprites for a more classic look.

859
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,170
Oh, fun!

860
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,890
Oh my god, I love when they do that.

861
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:18,790
Yeah!

862
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:19,430
Let's go!

863
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,890
You'll find character art, music, including orchestral arrangements, and more.

864
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:25,590
I'm so excited!

865
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:29,310
Past and present collide as you uncover the truth...

866
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:29,590
Yippee!

867
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,430
...at any cost.

868
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:38,290
Ace Attorney Investigations Collection launches on Nintendo Switch September 6th.

869
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:38,310
Yippee!

870
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:38,890
September!

871
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,510
So far for now!

872
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,030
Yippee!

873
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:48,330
Anime!

874
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:49,690
Oh no, Danganronpa?

875
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:52,870
Uh-oh.

876
00:43:58,830 --> 00:43:59,550
Uh-oh.

877
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,530
I was like, yay, anime!

878
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:04,970
Oh no, Danganronpa!

879
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,130
I don't think it is, or is it?

880
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:08,930
I don't think it is, though.

881
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,570
I think it's just the same art style.

882
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,390
After a devastating attack by unknown assailants...

883
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:19,690
Oh no!

884
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,530
Takumi Samino's life gets turned upside down.

885
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,590
A mysterious school mascot suddenly appears.

886
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:27,490
Me?

887
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:28,410
You?

888
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:35,650
While Takumi manages to get out of harm's way, he's then forced to enroll at the Last Defense Academy, along with 15 other students.

889
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,130
I hate when I'm forced to go to school.

890
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,570
Oh, who's the girl behind him?

891
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:43,950
With the tongue out!

892
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,230
Who is her?

893
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,930
My neurons have been peaked.

894
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:49,850
Oh, there she is!

895
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:51,030
Ah!

896
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,490
Darumi.

897
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:53,890
Oh my god.

898
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,590
His brain.

899
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,630
Maybe that is not me.

900
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:02,210
Or you.

901
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,210
Danganronpa.

902
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:08,530
The what?

903
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:09,030
The...

904
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,930
Oh wait, I can't read it.

905
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:10,330
The...

906
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,070
The what?

907
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:11,730
The...

908
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:12,830
What is the...

909
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,110
What does that say?

910
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,130
I can't read the font!

911
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:17,350
What?

912
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,690
I didn't hear what he said!

913
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,330
Oh, the hundred line!

914
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:25,490
Oh!

915
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,310
I'm sure there will be people excited about this.

916
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,670
Oh no!

917
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:43,430
Did someone mention the Door to Darkness?

918
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,750
A lot of remakes.

919
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:48,410
Yeah, a lot of remakes.

920
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:48,770
Yeah.

921
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:55,430
Oh!

922
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:08,470
What is up with these brainy creatures?

923
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,670
What is up with these brainy creatures?

924
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,210
Every decision you make will dramatically alter the course of the story.

925
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:16,330
Haha!

926
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,270
Serves her right!

927
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,490
Why didn't you pick that, you coward?

928
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:22,250
Haha!

929
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,390
Serves her right!

930
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:28,330
Otherwise, the vengeful seven heroes may emerge victorious.

931
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:30,990
Harpy.

932
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:37,670
Romancing Saga 2 Revenge of the Seven launches on Nintendo Switch October 24th.

933
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:38,590
Haha!

934
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:39,810
Hahaha!

935
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:41,390
Haha!

936
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:46,270
We hope you're excited to experience the full remake of Romancing Saga 2.

937
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,190
Oh my gosh, it's already almost been an hour.

938
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:50,550
That's almost everything for today's Nintendo Direct.

939
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:50,970
Uh-oh.

940
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:52,490
Tomodachi Life.

941
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:53,890
The next will be our last announcement.

942
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:54,490
Tomodachi Life.

943
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:54,990
Please take a look.

944
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:56,630
The last announcement, you guys!

945
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:59,710
I'm holding my breath!

946
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:03,350
No!

947
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:06,550
Wait, it could still be Tomodachi Life!

948
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:06,870
Hahaha!

949
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,410
It's Metroid.

950
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,290
Samus!

951
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:24,610
Tomodachi Life!

952
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,230
Come on, bait and switch us!

953
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,270
FPS?

954
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,330
FPS, Samus?

955
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:49,230
Interesting.

956
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,440
Space pirate.

957
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:02,920
Oh.

958
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:08,270
Nasty.

959
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:12,150
Hahaha!

960
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,620
Ooh!

961
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:34,870
Let's go!

962
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,540
One more trust.

963
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,720
2025.

964
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,020
Okay.

965
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,220
Next year, guys.

966
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,400
No Silksong?

967
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,480
No Tomodachi Life 2.

968
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,800
That was a first look at Metroid Prime 4 Beyond.

969
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,880
After a very long time, we are finally able to share more information about this title.

970
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:15,420
Release is planned for 2025, so please wait a little bit longer.

971
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,220
That's what he's telling everybody to...

972
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,000
Silksong?

973
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,320
Please wait a little bit longer.

974
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,320
That's all for today's Nintendo Direct.

975
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,480
Thank you for watching.

976
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,480
Thank you.

977
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:36,750
Ace Attorney!

978
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,150
That's all I'm thinking about right now.

979
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:44,350
That and the...

980
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:46,870
That and the new Zelda game.

981
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,060
Thank you for hosting this watch-along.

982
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:54,900
Thank you guys!

983
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:55,980
Thanks for joining.

984
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,120
Thanks for hanging out.

985
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,960
Sorry no Tomodachi Life, Minto.

986
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:01,500
It's okay.

987
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:01,640
Bye!

988
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:02,840
I hope people...

989
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,760
You know...

990
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,500
When they stop, or rather...

991
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,240
When they keep not announcing it...

992
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,540
The more watch-alongs we'll do.

993
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,000
The more watch-alongs we'll do!

994
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:17,860
Since we're just...

995
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,180
Holding out, maybe?

996
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,860
We didn't get skong...

997
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,940
But we got a new Zelda.

998
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,500
New Zelda looks interesting.

999
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,180
You're also pretty fun to me.

1000
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,440
That's cool.

1001
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:30,580
Anyway...

1002
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:30,820
I didn't...

1003
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,760
I'm not sure how I feel.

1004
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:41,340
Like, I actually really like how you fight in Zelda and stuff, so not having my little sword and everything makes me a little sad, but we'll see.

1005
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,080
It still looks interesting.

1006
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,260
Mario Brotherhood?

1007
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,440
Call it what it is, it was Brother Ship!

1008
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,840
Don't erase the Brother Ship!

1009
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,900
That's where the gumshoe can be your Tomodachi!

1010
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:57,700
Stop!

1011
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,680
Yeah, we have the tri... what was it?

1012
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:07,300
The tri... the tri-hard... the tri-wand... the tri-fairy!

1013
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,340
That was fun though.

1014
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,260
Hold on, let me erase that.

1015
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,540
Is there anything else?

1016
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,280
Oh, it just says thank you for watching.

1017
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,060
And it's over.

1018
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:32,640
I'm looking at some of like the... thingies?

1019
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,280
The... what's it called that you gave me?

1020
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:38,980
The recommendations?

1021
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,480
And right there, Silksong announcement trailer!

1022
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,340
Five years ago!

1023
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,860
Oh man...

1024
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,180
Brother Ship.

1025
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,920
Can't believe DoomStream manifested Turok.

1026
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:57,700
I know, right?

1027
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:58,640
That too!

1028
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,420
We were literally just talking about it.

1029
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,060
That's so funny.

1030
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,880
I love watching these with you.

1031
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,500
Thank you, Ruby!

1032
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,860
Oh yeah, the Metal Slug Tower Defense!

1033
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,100
It said it was gonna be available today, right?

1034
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,220
I will be... I will be grabbing it.

1035
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,500
I will be... downloading that.

1036
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,280
I love Tower Defense.

1037
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:26,920
That's a... I've wanted to play... isn't Arknights also Tower Defense?

1038
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,600
But... I've heard it's really hard, so...

1039
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,260
Silksong died so the Brother Ship could sail.

1040
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,880
I got news, Ace Combat 7... not in the Direct.

1041
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,200
But release on the Switch July 11th... wait, really?

1042
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,040
Was that in the Jap... wait, what was in the Japanese Direct?

1043
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,200
That we missed?

1044
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:48,260
Wait, what was in the Japanese Direct?

1045
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,260
That we missed?

1046
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,260
Wait, what was in the Japanese Direct?

1047
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,260
That we missed?

1048
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,260
Wait, what was in the Japanese Direct?

1049
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,260
That we missed?

1050
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,700
Um... Japanese Nintendo Direct.

1051
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,650
Maybe I should've watched the Japanese one.

1052
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,130
Metal Slug TD is actually a mobile game that's getting ported.

1053
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:13,710
Oh, really?

1054
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:16,210
Oh, I see.

1055
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:17,550
I see.

1056
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,330
Uh...

1057
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:25,610
Direct.

1058
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,290
Maybe I should go to... hold on.

1059
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,270
I wonder if she has a link.

1060
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,550
I see Korone-san stream up.

1061
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:38,910
So I'm just gonna... I wonder if she has... Oh, she does have it linked!

1062
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:39,530
Yippee!

1063
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:43,530
Thank you, Koro-san.

1064
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,770
Um... I'm scrolling through...

1065
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,030
What did they start with?

1066
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,110
They started with...

1067
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:55,770
Oh, Mega Man!

1068
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:57,150
Hold on.

1069
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:59,550
Let me, uh...

1070
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,450
Let me get the window up.

1071
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:03,630
Window capture.

1072
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:17,720
Sorry, the cut's gonna be a little ugly, but...

1073
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,660
Or the crop, rather.

1074
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,480
There we go.

1075
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,400
Let's see what we have.

1076
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,200
What we missed in the Japanese one.

1077
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:28,400
Mega Man!

1078
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:28,900
Mega Man!

1079
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,080
Oh, sorry.

1080
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:30,720
Rock Man.

1081
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:33,860
Um...

1082
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,000
Does the Japanese stream longer?

1083
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:36,840
I don't think so.

1084
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,780
Can make it a little bit bigger.

1085
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:47,880
There we go.

1086
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,300
We're not gonna watch the whole thing.

1087
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,360
I'm just gonna skip through it.

1088
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,400
Rock Man World 3!

1089
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,820
Oh my god, my eyes.

1090
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,700
I didn't know they had different things.

1091
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:07,940
Yeah!

1092
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:14,760
I'm skipping.

1093
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,600
Is this the Brother Ship?

1094
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,680
No!

1095
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,580
Oh, sorry.

1096
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,460
Oh, wait!

1097
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,260
Stop, please!

1098
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,020
Wait!

1099
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,400
No, wait!

1100
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,840
It was Paper Mario RPG!

1101
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,000
What is this?

1102
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,860
Wait, hold on, hold on.

1103
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,810
I saw something else, though.

1104
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,250
Oh, this fish game.

1105
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:44,230
What the hell is this?

1106
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:49,310
Fish.

1107
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:53,230
Wait,

1108
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,140
this hasn't even started.

1109
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,280
Right.

1110
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:07,900
When does it start?

1111
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,760
Oh, maybe it has...

1112
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,980
Oh, here's the actual direct.

1113
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,900
I'm just going through advertisements at the moment.

1114
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,960
Oh my gosh, I'm an idiot.

1115
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:14,660
Sorry, guys.

1116
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,820
I'm going through...

1117
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,920
I just read the bottom.

1118
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,340
It says it starts at 11.

1119
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,500
That's what it says.

1120
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,980
Oh my god.

1121
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,620
Oh, that's my alarm.

1122
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:26,920
Sorry.

1123
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:27,820
Whoopsie.

1124
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,240
There we go.

1125
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,280
I'm looking at the fish, man.

1126
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,540
I was excited about the fish.

1127
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,320
Okay, we got the Brother Ship.

1128
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,640
We got this same thing.

1129
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,640
Oh, the Lego Horizons.

1130
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,180
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1131
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:45,900
That...

1132
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:47,840
Dementia game.

1133
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,440
Fantasian games.

1134
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,220
Sports.

1135
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,180
What is this?

1136
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,360
Oh.

1137
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,040
Metal Slug.

1138
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,520
Oh, not Fairy Tail 3?

1139
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,240
What is this?

1140
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,600
There's always, like, one of those fashion games, you know?

1141
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,020
Oh, Mickey Mouse.

1142
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,000
I also...

1143
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,180
It's also so curious why, like, the order's so different, too, you know?

1144
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:13,620
Dragon Quest.

1145
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,680
Dragon Quest.

1146
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:17,900
The Capcom.

1147
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,600
What is this?

1148
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,840
But there is a Fairy Tail 3.

1149
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,640
What is this?

1150
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,760
Look at the little Wii's.

1151
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:38,840
Morro!

1152
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:39,760
KT!

1153
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:40,800
You're welcome to the membership!

1154
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,320
Thank you!

1155
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,600
Oh, Monkey Ball.

1156
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:44,640
No.

1157
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:45,320
Butto Bird.

1158
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,840
Not the Monkey Ball at all.

1159
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:53,840
Yeah.

1160
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,260
I want to Sugoshi...

1161
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,100
What is this?

1162
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,620
Wow.

1163
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:04,200
Hot.

1164
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,540
What is this?

1165
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:11,990
Oh.

1166
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:12,750
Perfect Dark.

1167
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:13,330
I'm just kidding.

1168
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:16,870
The mashing.

1169
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,470
I'm skipping forward.

1170
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,310
Fairy Tail.

1171
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,110
Actual Fairy Tail.

1172
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,380
Phantom.

1173
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,860
Of course there's Power Pro!

1174
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,820
It wouldn't be...

1175
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:39,700
The...

1176
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,000
Did you see that?ORA!

1177
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:44,780
Final

1178
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,020
Gear Vengeance!

1179
00:58:59,140 --> 00:58:59,680
Let's go!

1180
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:05,210
It's Snake!

1181
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,970
Oh my god, he's even in the three pose.

1182
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:10,530
Let's go!

1183
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:12,630
That's my little guy!

1184
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:14,970
That's my little maker!

1185
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,300
He will be released once we get the delta.

1186
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,460
Oh, it just popped open.

1187
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,030
Is he still in an egg?

1188
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:32,350
Yeah!

1189
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:36,630
It's the same little guy!

1190
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:40,750
I knew that they were going to be in the...

1191
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,990
Actually, I didn't know that they were going to be in the game.

1192
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:47,550
Wait, so does that mean like Pyramid Head and Goemon and...

1193
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:49,250
Yippee!

1194
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:52,990
I'm so happy just to see him right there!

1195
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:56,130
Skim!

1196
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:00,950
Oh, it's so wet.

1197
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:02,930
It's really...

1198
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:04,090
Oh, it's so wet.

1199
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:06,990
Oh my god, Silksong!

1200
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:13,350
They announced Silksong for the JP side, everybody!

1201
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,430
What is this?

1202
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:25,570
There's so much going on here.

1203
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,390
Don't give us hope.

1204
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:34,190
Ninja Slayer!

1205
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:42,770
Reynatus?

1206
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:45,170
Reynatus?

1207
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,780
Oh, here's a Mario Party.

1208
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,740
Skip, skip, skip.

1209
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,300
Skip, skip, skip.

1210
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,140
Legend of Zelda.

1211
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,160
Skip, skip, skip.

1212
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,380
Skip, skip, skip.

1213
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:04,440
Stray.

1214
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,260
Skip, skip, skip.

1215
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,980
Super Mario Party Jamboree!

1216
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,060
Oh, Dempa Men's.

1217
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:10,740
Skip, skip.

1218
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:11,320
What is this?

1219
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,120
Fall Guys?

1220
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:19,840
They're so round!

1221
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,260
What is this?

1222
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:30,360
The true Silksong is the friends we made on the road.

1223
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,080
So true, Sebastian.

1224
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,340
Enki Party!

1225
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:37,600
I love that name!

1226
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:44,500
Ikiari!

1227
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,180
Sorry.

1228
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,920
I'm so excited.

1229
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,960
Look up, Shu!

1230
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:57,480
Look how cute!

1231
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,300
Wee!

1232
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:58,500
Wee!

1233
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:58,760
Wee!

1234
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:58,860
Wee!

1235
01:01:58,860 --> 01:01:58,900
Wee!

1236
01:01:59,160 --> 01:01:59,940
Wee!

1237
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,080
Wee!

1238
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:01,080
Wee!

1239
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,000
Wee!

1240
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Wee!

1241
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Wee!

1242
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Wee!

1243
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Wee!

1244
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Wee!

1245
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,080
Wee!

1246
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:02,080
Wee!

1247
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:02,280
Wee!

1248
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:02,280
Wee.

1249
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,560
Wee!

1250
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:07,660
Wee!

1251
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:08,600
I said,

1252
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:12,920
you are my best friend.

1253
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:13,860
And remember, my Dolphin Friends.

1254
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,960
A soul.

1255
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,280
Remove them.

1256
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,440
I am...

1257
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:24,460
I am...

1258
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:24,720
I am...

1259
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,860
Good, oh god.

1260
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,220
Oh, One Piece!

1261
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,160
See, I feel like this could totally be announced for us too, right?

1262
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:53,300
Anime.

1263
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,620
One Piece is real.

1264
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,600
The One Piece is real.

1265
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,620
They totally glossed over it.

1266
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,820
They were like, by the way, there's One Piece!

1267
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,320
Just a deluxe edition of the game RPG.

1268
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,800
Oh, the slime!

1269
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,600
I almost said fairy tale again.

1270
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,220
It's the slime!

1271
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,800
Oh, Gundam!

1272
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,770
Fairy tale 4!

1273
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:33,970
Oh, rhythm game.

1274
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,310
Looks a little slow though.

1275
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,110
UMA MUSHIME MECHAN!

1276
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:47,010
UMA MUSHIME!

1277
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,810
When will we get our UMA MUSHIME?

1278
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,350
Oh, Natsumon!

1279
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:00,090
The audio station will start streaming after this stream ends.

1280
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:03,690
I, um...

1281
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,970
OK, not dangamonpa.

1282
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,570
Skip, skip, skip.

1283
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,490
Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

1284
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:18,710
Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

1285
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:19,970
Oh, sorry.

1286
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:20,770
Skipped too far.

1287
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:23,190
I got too excited.

1288
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:26,810
I got too excited.

1289
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:27,510
I got too excited.

1290
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,480
Looks pretty ominous.

1291
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:41,100
Wait, no, this is just the... this is the Saga, isn't it?

1292
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,300
This is the Saga game, is it not?

1293
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,140
Romancing Saga?

1294
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,040
Yeah, yeah, my bad.

1295
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,860
And then... Metroid.

1296
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:52,120
And that's it.

1297
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:53,860
Really?

1298
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:57,100
Maybe there's some other stuff that I accidentally skipped over, but...

1299
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,940
Not too much of a difference.

1300
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:00,980
Luigi?

1301
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:01,040
Luigi?

1302
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,060
Luigi?

1303
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:07,480
Brothership.

1304
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,480
Yeah, like, they start... oh wait, no, this is the... okay, there's...

1305
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,200
Not too much of a difference.

1306
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,260
Just a little bit.

1307
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,560
They didn't even have one of those, like, fashion games.

1308
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,260
I'm so shocked.

1309
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,380
Where is JP Funko?

1310
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:30,520
They didn't do the Funko... the Funko Pop game!

1311
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:31,540
Woohoo!

1312
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:37,890
I can't believe we're getting Funko Pop game.

1313
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,630
Well guys, that was, uh, direct.

1314
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:43,470
Oh my...

1315
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:48,430
No, there was some... there was some... a lot of... a lot... a lot of remakes, right?

1316
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:52,650
JP doesn't get Freddy... Fazbear Funko game rip.

1317
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:54,250
Rip indeed.

1318
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:56,490
That was fun.

1319
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:57,490
Yeah, that was fun!

1320
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:59,770
Maybe you skipped Tomodachi Life 2.

1321
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:00,670
Yeah, of course!

1322
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:10,770
I can't believe the Funko Pop game is actually, like, it feels like it's rivaling Fortnite in terms of, like, you know, everybody...

1323
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:12,170
Like, there's so many different collabs.

1324
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:14,050
You could see so-and-so fight so-and-so.

1325
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:15,710
Arigato, arigato.

1326
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:16,510
Chuuu.

1327
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:17,690
Chuuu.

1328
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:21,290
I remember once the JP direct announced a new Super Robot Wars game.

1329
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:22,610
Big hype moment for me.

1330
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:23,590
Thanks for the watch-along.

1331
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:24,190
Thank you!

1332
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:28,590
Yeah, a lot of ghosts in this direct.

1333
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,170
A lot of phantom mention.

1334
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:33,460
And of course...

1335
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:37,070
What was this?

1336
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:43,010
I skipped over it on accident earlier.

1337
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:45,930
That looks a little spooky, though.

1338
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,180
I'll never forget the one time I was, like, hoping for a new Fatal Frame.

1339
01:06:56,580 --> 01:07:00,820
And they did the direct while I was at work, so...

1340
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:01,780
I was like...

1341
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,820
Oh, it was right after...

1342
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,020
Sanrio Crossing.

1343
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,740
Very text-heavy horror game.

1344
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,180
This part is terrifying!

1345
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,700
And they look so happy about it!

1346
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,620
They're like, woohoo!

1347
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:18,660
We're almost gonna die!

1348
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:23,240
For some reason, the stream just does not want to...

1349
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,840
Look how tiny he is!

1350
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,180
My little dog!

1351
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,300
He's so cute!

1352
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,840
He's the king number one, baby!

1353
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,840
I can't believe Pompompurin got booted.

1354
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:38,040
I think it's been, like, a decade since Pompompurin has not been in the top three.

1355
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:42,440
And Pompompurin got top four.

1356
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:47,400
He was fourth in this year's Sanrio ranking.

1357
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,340
It's kinda crazy.

1358
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,880
Pochako is number two, I believe?

1359
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,300
Kuromi was three.

1360
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:55,580
Um...

1361
01:07:58,180 --> 01:07:59,160
Pompompurin was...

1362
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,240
Four.

1363
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:02,920
I can't remember.

1364
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,860
PhiloKitty was five, I think?

1365
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,300
Why is it loading?

1366
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,720
Okay, 53...

1367
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,640
Oh, he's so cute!

1368
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:23,220
He's so cute even when he's making witchcraft.

1369
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,240
Love it.

1370
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:26,860
Um...

1371
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,260
Thanks for the streaming!

1372
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:30,960
Going back to work!

1373
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:31,600
Good luck with work!

1374
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,060
Okay, here we go.

1375
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:43,260
Oh my god.

1376
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,560
It's not Higurashi.

1377
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,520
So, this is a series.

1378
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,320
I've never heard of it before, though.

1379
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:56,520
Whoa!

1380
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:57,500
Oh!

1381
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,840
Oh, I said Higurashi.

1382
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:01,900
Maybe I should have said Umineko.

1383
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:11,140
Oh my goodness, the amount of text.

1384
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,520
It's so cool, though.

1385
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,420
They know the Hannin.

1386
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:21,760
Oh, I wanna play!

1387
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,720
But my Nihongo is not good.

1388
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,420
Well, Umineko Mansion.

1389
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:26,860
Let's go!

1390
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:28,380
I mean, they're on an island.

1391
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:31,560
Someone's dying, you know.

1392
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,540
Mucho texto.

1393
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:33,860
Cool.

1394
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,940
Ever played Famicom Detective Club?

1395
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:36,600
Not yet!

1396
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:37,660
Not yet.

1397
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,860
Sadly, this probably won't get translated.

1398
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,200
The first two haven't!

1399
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:43,360
Unless there's like a fan translation, but yeah.

1400
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:44,400
Probably...

1401
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,100
Probably not.

1402
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,720
Probably not.

1403
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:51,260
Play game, become Jozu.

1404
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,640
The thing about those types of games is that since they're made for like a...

1405
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,760
They're made for like, you know, an audience...

1406
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,840
Like a mature audience.

1407
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,120
So I'm just like...

1408
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:03,980
Furigana doko?

1409
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:07,660
Furigana doko?

1410
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,580
Oh no.

1411
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,320
Can't read.

1412
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,580
I would have to like...

1413
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,160
I would get very Jozu, probably.

1414
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,480
But this is how...

1415
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,680
But this is...

1416
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,460
A long time ago...

1417
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:24,040
I feel like a lot of people learn from visual novels and stuff.

1418
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,140
I learned from Love Plus.

1419
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:29,020
I learned a lot of stuff from Love Plus.

1420
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:29,720
So...

1421
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,980
And then I forgot it all.

1422
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:31,620
But...

1423
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:32,540
Yeah.

1424
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:36,500
So...

1425
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:36,960
Yeah.

1426
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,620
A lot of people learn from visual novels, I feel like.

1427
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,900
Love Plus mentioned...

1428
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,580
A game will probably...

1429
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:47,260
Never ever get again.

1430
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,280
So sad.

1431
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:49,700
Thanks for the pink!

1432
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,100
Thanks for doing this watch-along.

1433
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:53,680
Any games you're interested in streaming?

1434
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,380
And streaming?

1435
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,660
I don't know about that.

1436
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,600
Maybe the Metroid game.

1437
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,420
But I would want to play the other ones too, right?

1438
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,700
Ronin, thank you!

1439
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:07,700
Eternal Kamioshi.

1440
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:08,780
Thank you so much!

1441
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:11,720
But...

1442
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,720
The Love Plus gacha died.

1443
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,380
Love Plus everything died.

1444
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:17,800
Arigato, arigato.

1445
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:18,320
Chu!

1446
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,120
Chu!

1447
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,520
Thank you, Ducky!

1448
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,460
My wife gets released.

1449
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,660
And some friends and I will be pulling for her.

1450
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,780
May you bestow upon us your blessing...

1451
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,260
On our firefly...

1452
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:31,420
You would firefly, man.

1453
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,360
Ooh, mint neko.

1454
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,160
It's okay if you just bless mine.

1455
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:36,820
I won't tell.

1456
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:38,700
I bless...

1457
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,480
You and your firefly pulls.

1458
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,540
Moi moi.

1459
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:48,760
Moi moi!

1460
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,000
Pull.

1461
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:58,720
Please.

1462
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,100
I like firefly.

1463
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:05,980
I think she's very cute.

1464
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,880
Though I don't know anything about Honkai.

1465
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,580
Can you curse them instead?

1466
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,820
Coming from a ghost, it might be a curse instead of a blessing, right?

1467
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,380
Would you recommend Love Plus for Japanese learning?

1468
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:22,200
I think so.

1469
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,380
I think I would.

1470
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:28,560
Because it's always better to learn from something that's like a little bit more conversational, right?

1471
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:35,520
Fun fact, when Umineko was releasing, it would take months for Ian to get a translated version.

1472
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:38,180
There's software that would read the screen and translate the game.

1473
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,080
Some of the oldest memes have come from that.

1474
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:42,180
I've read three games that way.

1475
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,280
Oh my gosh, Saku.

1476
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,440
Your brain.

1477
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:53,190
Well guys, this was fun!

1478
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:55,490
Thanks again for joining me.

1479
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:58,790
For watching the watch along.

1480
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:00,550
The direct together.

1481
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:01,990
What is this?

1482
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:07,790
I guess Xenoblade X remake will have to wait for Switch 2.

1483
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:11,550
Yeah, where's our Switch 2 announcement, huh?

1484
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:15,570
Ace Combat 7 had already announced on Switch during January.

1485
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,430
Ah, I see, I see.

1486
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:20,830
The producer for Ace Combat franchise confirmed the release date today on Twitter.

1487
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:22,370
Ah, got it, got it.

1488
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:23,470
Nice.

1489
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:25,470
I wonder how it'll play on the Switch though.

1490
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:27,890
No wonder.

1491
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:32,350
See you tonight for more Outer Wilds.

1492
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:33,790
Yes, I will be streaming again tonight.

1493
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:34,850
Outer Wilds.

1494
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,890
So, short stream today.

1495
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,430
But, for now.

1496
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:40,750
Short stream for now.

1497
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:46,270
And I might see some of you guys later for some more Outer Wilds.

1498
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:48,470
And if not, then I'll see you maybe...

1499
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:49,630
What am I playing tomorrow?

1500
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:52,010
Playing Deal or No Deal tomorrow.

1501
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:52,570
Yippee!

1502
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:57,550
I just wanted to play Deal or No Deal.

1503
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:59,130
For some reason.

1504
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,810
I don't even know how to play that game.

1505
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:04,110
But...

1506
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:05,450
Yeah.

1507
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:06,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1508
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:09,090
Thank you!

1509
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:10,970
And...

1510
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:12,690
Yeah.

1511
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:14,310
I'm gonna go maybe take a nap.

1512
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:17,450
Have fun with the Metal Slug game.

1513
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:18,230
Thank you!

1514
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:19,970
Yeah.

1515
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:21,030
Maybe I'll stream that.

1516
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:21,390
Maybe.

1517
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:23,170
I don't know what to stream from...

1518
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:24,630
Maybe Donkey Kong?

1519
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:28,330
Hmm...

1520
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:37,210
Yeah, yeah.

1521
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:38,910
Yeah.

1522
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:39,810
Yeah.

1523
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:40,470
Ace Attorney.

1524
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:43,110
I should return to Ace Attorney, huh?

1525
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:47,990
Okay.

1526
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:49,050
Oh yeah.

1527
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:50,330
Everybody...

1528
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:51,670
I'm gonna go eat some breakfast too.

1529
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:52,430
