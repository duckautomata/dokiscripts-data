1
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:08,780
Yay!

2
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,240
We're going straight in.

3
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,140
I had no intro.

4
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,140
I just went straight in.

5
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,940
You just opened up on the game.

6
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:17,660
Wow.

7
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,040
Just like, raw.

8
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,060
That's it.

9
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,240
That's usually what happens in Collapse.

10
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,080
I just go straight in.

11
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,160
At that point, I stop putting an intro.

12
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:34,520
It reminds me of when I was like a Camelist streamer and I would literally hit the go live button on the game title screen and there was like no fanfare whatsoever.

13
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,860
Yeah, it was just here.

14
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,340
It's time to give.

15
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,280
Yeah.

16
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,500
The reason why Snuffy sounds like she's dead inside is that we literally woke her up from a Discord call.

17
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,360
You don't need to be rude, chat.

18
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,120
Some people think it's attractive.

19
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,760
The reason Snuffy has sexy morning voice is because...

20
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,340
And though some people is Lime.

21
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,860
Alright, so we just need...

22
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,160
Oh yeah, Snuffy, I need you to appear online for like one second.

23
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,580
Oh yeah, yeah, okay.

24
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,020
So I can get you in the lobby.

25
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,040
After months of staying offline, I risk it all for this.

26
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,140
Just for this.

27
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,660
Don't know you're alive now, you're now back on the grid.

28
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,560
It happens to me too.

29
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,540
Like, I just hide offline forever and then people are like, no, you have to be online.

30
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,700
It's like, but...

31
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,660
You have to be online.

32
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,720
That's why I'm hosting, so I don't have to be online.

33
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,060
But then no one will know when I'm playing my porn games if I'm not online.

34
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,940
You don't even have massage.

35
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,380
What's Orc Massage?

36
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,240
That's not the only game.

37
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,400
But it's your game.

38
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,480
That's your game.

39
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,840
That's not my game, it's the people's game.

40
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,720
I don't know why they're twerking, Emo.

41
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,920
Like, my guy looks like he's like...

42
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,480
It's okay, Snuffy, neither have I.

43
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,460
We just spent, like, the last ten minutes, like, finding stupid things to put on our characters.

44
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,000
There's nobody to blame.

46
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,540
We literally spent money.

47
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,260
We bought skins.

48
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,760
What?

49
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,180
I didn't even see that.

50
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,540
I got scammed because I'm...

51
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,320
Welcome to the default redhead.

52
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,720
What?

53
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,480
You guys look like my cool babs and I look like I'm a green...

54
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,780
Hey, look, my pet rat.

55
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,920
Do you like my pet rat over here?

56
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,160
We're the dads and our twin daughters.

57
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,000
The gay dads and our twin daughters.

58
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,360
The gay dads and then, like, you got the hipster daughter over here and then the one that turned to religion, apparently.

59
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,580
She looks like she should be in, like, an Irish pub.

60
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,920
Canadian, eh?

61
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,480
Oh, wait!

62
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,300
And then we all moved to Canada.

63
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,300
Wait, you got a rat?

64
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:55,800
Yeah!

65
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,180
Yeah, she had a rat, too.

66
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,820
She looks after her cooler father.

67
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,820
Okay, you guys cannot look at me and say that I'm not the cooler father.

68
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,180
Look at me!

69
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,440
Yes, you can!

70
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,080
I'm literally a fucking ex-Hollywood star!

71
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,660
What do you mean an ex-Hollywood star?

72
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,560
It says, Sam, washed up Hollywood star.

73
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,300
Loves John Wayne movies and Satan.

74
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,000
Hates most people.

75
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,800
Wait, he loves Satan?

76
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,500
Why is he...

77
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,120
No one cares about an ex-Hollywood star.

78
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,440
Oh, you care.

79
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,600
You fucking are the other gay dad.

80
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,920
Wait, okay, hold on.

81
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,920
I might join a cult one day instead of going into work.

82
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,520
I've been in a cult!

83
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,080
I'm a competitive eating champion!

84
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,480
Oh yeah, that's why they said I'm the cooler dad.

85
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,120
Wait, I need to put my alphabet back on.

86
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,860
Yeah.

87
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,820
Is this pre-cult or post-cult?

88
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,100
This is post-cult and I own the cult.

89
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:14,120
I'm co-own the cult and these are the two children we had that we did not steal into our family.

90
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,240
That we didn't indoctrinate into the cult.

91
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,300
How come I don't look anything like you?

92
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,240
So, like, basically this is what Tom Cruise wishes you.

93
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't think he wants to be a washed up actor though.

94
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,060
That's true, other than that part.

95
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,320
Okay, I bought my outfit so I don't feel like such a freaking plebian with you guys.

96
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,060
I am now...

97
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,680
Oh yeah, yeah.

98
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,820
You have a lot of hair.

99
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,540
It's so good!

100
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,940
Oh yeah, Min, you're apparently really...

101
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,580
Oh, well, we're gonna be using in-game volume though, guys.

102
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

103
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,540
So if she's too low, I'd have to fix her right now, cause...

105
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,700
You can't fix me.

106
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,240
I don't think she's ever fixable.

107
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,820
I don't think...

108
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,220
I don't...

109
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,280
Are we all ready?

110
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,280
Yeah.

111
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,940
I think so.

112
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,340
I wanted to be the short girl, but she didn't have any cool outfits, really.

113
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,660
So I was kinda sad about that.

114
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:28,860
So we have player collision is on, proximity voice is on, batteries are on, and medkits are on, and perks are...

115
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,660
I don't know what the perks are, but they're also on, so...

116
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,000
We don't have any, cause we have never played the game.

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
Oh, that's true.

118
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,840
So we're going straight in, with like, everything possible.

119
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,180
So...

120
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,000
We've never played this game, I'm not sure what we're capable of, but...

121
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,360
It's gonna be great.

122
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,640
We're gonna do great.

123
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,420
There's an objective, and also make sure you have voice enabled.

124
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,740
I'm gonna mute Discord now.

125
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,440
Yeah, me too.

126
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:55,940
Okay.

127
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,240
Alright.

128
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,220
Alright.

129
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,600
I believe in us.

130
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,060
Can you guys hear me okay?

131
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,220
Yeah.

132
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,400
Wait, let me see...

133
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,260
Let me see, can we like, turn people, maybe we can turn people up in game, right?

134
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,720
I'm just turning down the music and the sound effects, and I'm turning up the game.

135
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,360
Oh, wait, I forgot you could do that.

136
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,040
Right.

137
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,060
Okay, music, sound effects, and then...

138
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,920
I'll turn up the game more.

139
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:24,720
Alright.

140
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,460
Should be good.

141
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,520
Okay, is this better?

142
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,920
Alright, guys, can you guys hear?

143
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,440
Can you guys hear me?

144
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,520
Yeah, I can hear you guys fine, because I turned everything but the voice chat volume down preemptively.

145
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,780
Okay, I'll turn the music just a little bit down, because I don't want to hear the wedding...

146
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,080
That wedding thing for like the hundredth time.

147
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,960
Oh my God, we've been listening to this song forever.

148
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,380
I can't.

149
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,500
Alright, guys, I'm readying it up now.

150
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,800
We're gonna go on a vacation, children.

151
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,140
With your new dads.

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,320
Yay!

153
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
I think one of our sons is like, our age.

154
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,820
No, he just works outdoors a lot.

155
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,780
Is this like my childhood baseball uniform I've been wearing since I was ten?

156
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,400
We've been telling you, you don't...

157
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,980
We've been telling you that you haven't aged past ten, so you think you're still ten years old.

158
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,320
Like, don't worry, it's your tenth birthday again.

159
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:26,940
Yay!

160
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,180
Yay!

161
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,220
Get away from presents from Santa.

162
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,480
You wanna sit on Santa's lap?

163
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,800
If I was his other costume, it was a Santa outfit, actually.

164
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,100
No way.

165
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't know if he does unfestive ones, but he can be Santa.

166
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,720
Oh my God, no, you're right.

167
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,420
Wait, so much hat.

168
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,640
No, she's Benjamin Button.

169
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,000
She's Benjamin Buttoning it right now.

170
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This outfit.

171
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,720
Benjamin Button was based off of our son.

172
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,640
The real story.

173
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,660
It's the real story.

174
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,020
I need you to ready up.

175
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,680
Oh, sorry.

176
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,440
I'm ready.

177
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,540
I turned down my sound effects and brought up the game volume.

178
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,280
Let me know it's better.

179
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,200
There we go, guys.

180
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,680
Let me know if the volume is okay and everything.

181
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,380
England?

182
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,640
She's giving me super Miss Havisham vibes.

183
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,580
Azazel.

184
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,780
Yeah, this is a new level.

185
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,740
Ooh.

186
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,960
Azazel.

187
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:08,220
Why are we a fellow cult member?

188
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,900
Waiting for the host.

189
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,260
Hello.

190
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,020
Wait, how do I turn...oh, there you go.

191
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,520
Jesus.

192
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,420
Hello.

193
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,540
Hello, guys.

194
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,760
Guys, just so you guys know, our flashlight has batteries.

195
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,900
Just so you guys know.

196
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,680
Wait, oh my gosh.

197
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,720
The...

198
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,960
Gameplay, maybe?

199
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,020
Sensitivity is so low, it's fucking impossible to see you guys without it.

200
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,820
Yeah, I know.

201
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:39,960
It's alright.

202
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,140
If our flashlight dies, it dies.

203
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,660
Oh, wait, no, that's UV.

204
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,780
Oh, no, the UV requires batteries.

205
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,540
Wait, what's our UV?

206
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,200
Oh, so the flashlight is blue?

207
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,780
Oh, the right click.

208
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,880
The right click.

210
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,660
You know when we burn the zombies...the monsters out?

211
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,500
Burn the ghost?

212
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,200
And we go...

213
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,980
Have you played this live?

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,320
Wait, Snuffy's not alive yet.

215
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,920
Snuffy's...Snuffy's like...

216
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,800
Snuffy is tracking the...

217
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,420
No, no, sorry.

218
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,060
I was turning my light on.

219
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,060
Is it because you're scared?

220
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,620
It's because I need good VTuber tracking.

221
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,360
Don't worry, son.

222
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,300
If you stick with your daddy, you'll be fine.

223
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,160
Shut up!

224
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,460
It's our Halloween costumes!

225
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,720
What is this purple thing we're doing?

226
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,280
What is that?

227
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,120
It's when there's a demon that comes at you.

228
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,280
By the way, that's limited battery, but...

229
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,460
Oh, it's doing, yeah.

230
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:39,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

231
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,200
Oh, it like recharges.

232
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:41,920
I think.

233
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,520
We need five batteries for it.

234
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,240
I figured it out.

235
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,560
Okay.

236
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,820
But like, it's used to chase away the monsters.

237
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,980
So when we go to this house, there's gonna be an objective...

238
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,880
I don't know if they like start the objective when we're...

239
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,940
I don't know.

240
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,600
When we find something.

241
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,760
Apparently they changed the game a little bit from this one.

242
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,080
Apparently this is like different from the previous ones too.

243
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,120
Hold on, I got this.

244
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,200
I don't know about you guys, but my character is fucking incapable of jumping.

245
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,840
She's like so heavy or something.

246
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,000
Wait, I think that's your rats.

247
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,200
Oh my god, I see your rats!

248
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,380
They're walking around at your feet!

249
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,180
I literally have no, like, HUD in this game.

250
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,320
So it just really looks like a bunch of dads trying to like...

251
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,800
That is us, that is us.

252
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,580
Don't worry, I'll be here to pick you.

253
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,080
I'll be here to catch you.

254
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,880
Don't worry son, I'll catch you.

255
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,200
I'm gonna burn your rat.

256
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,740
What was that?

257
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,800
I heard a dog.

258
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,560
Oh, I got a medkit.

259
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,680
There's a crow on this basin, or fountain even.

260
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,620
I think he's an evil crow.

261
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,820
He has glowing eyes.

262
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,940
Wait, I think that's...

263
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,580
Oh wait, look!

264
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,080
It's the angels!

265
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,180
They turned down my sound effects.

266
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,780
I just got a pumpkin.

267
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,920
I think we have to destroy pumpkins.

268
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,120
Collect 60?

269
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,440
Ok, we are not collecting 60 pumpkins.

270
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,920
Are they fucking satanic pumpkins or something?

271
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,520
Probably.

272
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,360
Good job.

273
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,420
Oh, there's a dead person!

274
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,600
Oh, he's headless!

275
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,100
He's headless!

276
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,840
No head!

277
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,800
What?

278
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,700
Oh wait, where's his head?

279
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,040
Is this a headless horseman?

280
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,580
No, it's a priest.

281
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,000
Alright children, it's time for family photo everybody.

282
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,080
This is one of those photo ops where you stick your head in.

283
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,020
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,080
Yeah, it's like a cut out.

285
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,320
Ok, I'll take the picture.

286
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll take the picture.

287
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,240
Everybody say cheese!

288
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,820
Cheese!

289
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,080
How do I screenshot on...

290
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,460
Steam?

291
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,020
F12.

292
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,880
F12.

293
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,820
Oh, it worked!

294
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,580
Yay!

295
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,800
What a great start to our family vacation!

296
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,520
Wait, so is my light gonna die?

297
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,920
No, no, no.

298
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,040
Oh wait, there's a woman.

299
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,840
There's a woman here.

300
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,140
That's my wife.

301
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,380
Don't disrespect...oh, nevermind, that's a child.

302
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,340
Sorry, I got a little excited.

303
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,100
You have to differentiate, please!

304
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,800
I got battered.

305
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,960
Dude, is your rat useful?

306
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,720
Is he like a tool?

307
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,940
No, I think he just follows you.

308
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,400
Yeah, I think he just follows.

309
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,040
He's gonna...

310
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,360
I keep getting stuck on him.

311
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,980
He's gonna rat you out.

312
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,840
He's gonna like...

313
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,380
Yeah, I wonder what happens if you had a pig and you just have a giant ass pig following you around.

314
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,680
Yeah, probably.

315
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,180
That'd be pretty awesome.

316
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,840
It was over this way before you ran off after the bodies, I think.

317
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,780
And we just walked away to look at dead bodies.

318
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,600
I mean, we had to get a family photo.

319
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,620
Probably.

320
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,800
The family photo was important, guys.

321
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,240
It's really funny because you literally like 180'd away from a dead body right here to go look at the other one.

322
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,360
Oh, this one's so cute!

323
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,220
She is?

324
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,900
That's your dead wife.

325
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,540
That's my dead wife, everybody.

326
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,960
I think it's a camera.

327
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,860
She's holding a camera.

328
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,740
It was her favorite thing.

329
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,220
In the bedroom.

330
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,740
Don't turn your black lights on around me, guys.

331
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,880
There's another body here, even.

332
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,940
Is that another lady?

333
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,100
I think we killed the chef.

334
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,160
Oh, is that the chef?

335
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,820
It looks like a chef out there, right?

336
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,440
Why are they all beheaded?

337
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,740
Doorways are one people wide.

338
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,680
What?

339
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,920
We can't get in there.

340
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,380
Wait, you can't actually go in?

341
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,320
Oh, look, another body.

342
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah, the door is locked.

343
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,460
Oh.

344
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,760
Maybe there has to be a secret entrance somewhere.

345
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,460
Secret.

346
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,620
The first struggle, finding the fucking door.

347
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,040
I've never played these games, so I'm relying on you guys.

348
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,220
I've only played one or two.

349
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,720
Look, it's the Liza P protagonist.

350
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,940
Oh, hey!

351
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,980
He has a nice suit.

352
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,820
We both played Devoured, but apparently this map is different from the other Devour.

353
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,660
Oh, I think we parkour here, right?

354
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,380
Maybe up the tree?

355
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,780
Maybe.

356
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,360
I'm going.

357
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,480
Alright, guys.

358
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,480
I'm doing really dad things right now.

359
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,480
Watch this, children.

360
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,780
This is how you do it.

361
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,520
Learn from us.

362
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,580
I'm stuck.

363
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,200
I think I'm stuck.

364
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,400
Wait.

365
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,280
Wait, are you stuck?

366
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,400
Hold on.

367
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,020
Hold on, I'm dad-stuck.

368
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,500
The demon is like, being in there for us, and we just...

369
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
It's different from normal...

370
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,300
Wait.

371
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,200
Ok, there we go.

372
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,360
We did it!

373
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,200
But for what purpose?

374
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,000
Ok, I need to turn my sensitivity up.

375
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,280
My sensitivity is way too low.

376
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,680
I know!

377
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,400
I had to turn mine up to...

378
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,280
Ok.

379
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,740
I wonder how long it's going to take for one of us to get yoinked, and then it takes like 10 years for anybody else to notice.

380
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,620
There's a door!

381
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,600
How do we get in?

382
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,360
I think the bird has to do with it, right?

383
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:27,940
No.

384
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,080
Everybody is over here.

385
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,520
Help me, step-wife.

386
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,780
I'm step-stuck.

387
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,340
We found it!

388
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,340
Oh, you did?

389
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:37,980
We found the door!

390
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,240
Get over here, children!

391
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,800
I'm coming.

392
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,320
I'm here!

393
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,860
The door?

394
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,800
Dad?

395
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,640
Oh, here.

396
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,560
This opens.

397
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,200
Wait a minute.

398
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,160
Snuffy, do you want to be a brave boy today?

399
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,360
You're making Snuffy go first.

400
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,940
Do you want to be a man today?

401
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,340
This is where you earn your man card.

402
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,060
Morello.

403
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,680
I'm finally going to get a girlfriend.

404
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Not with that pitch, you won't.

405
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:10,620
Ah!

406
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,240
The little rat is stuck.

407
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,040
Whose rat is that?

408
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,040
Oh my God, whose birthday is it?

409
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,860
Wait, there's a note.

410
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,860
Read it out for the class.

411
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,520
I can't believe it.

412
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,280
He's dead.

413
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,800
What the fuck?

414
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,000
Stop that.

415
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,000
How do you do that?

416
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,420
Stop that.

417
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,320
I got his voice right.

418
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,340
Press what?

419
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,040
Press the numbers.

420
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,680
Just the numbers.

421
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,980
Come on.

422
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,940
Oh my God.

423
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,880
I maybe kind of spent like a dollar on the Macarena.

424
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,680
I knew I should check this out.

425
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,680
Oh my God, it's Fortnite.

426
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,840
It's Fortnite.

427
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,120
He threw the rat into it.

428
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,260
Oh my God, he's really into it.

429
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,860
He got Macarena into it.

430
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,280
I picked up a piece of cake, but I can't even interact with that.

431
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,440
He really needs an item.

432
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,080
I picked up a bottle and I don't know what to do with it either.

433
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,500
Also, I'm not going to talk into Macarena.

434
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,120
Oh, I just moved.

435
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,580
I think this is a pumpkin, right?

436
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,220
I don't know.

437
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,820
This guy wrote sin in my comic sans with also blood.

438
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
He drew a heart in blood.

439
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,180
Can you bring yourself up a little bit in game?

440
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,780
You're a little quiet for me.

441
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,160
Is this better?

442
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,740
Maybe a little bit more.

443
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:28,780
I don't know.

444
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,040
How do I do it in game?

445
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,180
I'm just raising my mic.

446
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,360
I think it's a lot better.

447
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,180
Maybe because I have to be close to you.

448
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,180
We're in London, everybody.

449
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,180
I'm ready.

450
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,720
I saw the tunnel.

451
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,400
I'm ready.

452
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
I'm ready.

453
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,220
I'm ready.

454
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,240
I'm ready.

455
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,380
I'm ready.

456
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,580
It's okay.

457
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,340
I can fix this.

458
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,400
I've seen the ritual to summon Azazel.

459
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,120
I think I can do it.

460
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,180
I'll make him open a portal to the realm of the dead.

461
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,420
Then I'll find Michael there and we can be together again.

462
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,000
Oh, sorry.

463
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,180
I just made the sacrifices.

464
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,960
Heads would be best.

465
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,220
I love how that's like a Professor Layton English voice.

466
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,000
It's very good.

467
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,320
This reminds me of a puzzle.

468
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,360
Oh no.

469
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,560
How many demons put away the books?

470
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,640
The portal of the dead!

471
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,080
I don't like it in here.

472
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,500
Ouch!

473
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:19,900
Ouch!

474
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,420
Ouch!

475
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:20,900
I'm dying!

476
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,640
I'm dying!

477
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,900
Don't stand there.

478
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,700
Got a pumpkin.

479
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,240
Do we need to be in the blue world?

480
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,760
The ambience here.

481
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,140
There are people inside that door.

482
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,380
Yeah, I hear them crying.

483
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,480
Wait, you think it's the ghost?

484
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,040
Maybe.

485
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,580
Maybe we should go... I hear them on the other side.

486
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,580
This is like Stranger Things.

487
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,740
We are in the unknown.

488
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,100
Can you guys hear us?

489
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,840
We gotta get the flickering lights to communicate with each other.

490
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,360
Flickering lights?

491
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,640
Oh, there's another note here.

492
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,700
Oh, that's a bunch of names.

493
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:27,100
John, Jasmine, Hakeem, Nicholas, Eric, Tyra, Madison, Ashley, Christopher, Ellie...

494
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,980
That's it.

495
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,360
The upside down.

496
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,260
Wait, there's another mirror here.

497
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,820
Here.

498
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,400
I don't... Oh my god.

499
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,600
Wait, that door opens.

500
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,520
The lights started flickering in there.

501
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,000
I don't think we should go back.

502
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,160
Wait, what did you see?

503
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,620
What did you see?

504
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,060
I opened the door and then you left and then all the lights started flickering.

505
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,800
You opened the door?

506
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,040
There was a door.

507
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,260
I didn't go in.

508
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,400
Why did you open the door?

509
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,680
I needed my dad.

510
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,380
You're not supposed to touch anything.

511
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,780
That's the number one rule.

512
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,380
Don't touch anything.

513
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,880
I think we're in trouble.

514
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,920
What's wrong with the music?

515
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,300
The music is freaking out.

516
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,240
What did you do?

517
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,200
That's literally horror movie 101.

518
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,080
Maybe we should go back in.

519
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,440
Let's go back in.

520
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,520
Why would we be here if we're not meant to touch stuff?

521
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,160
You first.

522
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,340
Me first?

523
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,820
You're meant to touch everything.

524
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,460
Okay.

525
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,560
They're too baby.

526
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,240
Alright Lime, let's go.

527
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,060
Here we go.

528
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,200
You turned it back like you thought I would just ditch you in here.

529
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,360
That's okay.

530
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,180
Oh, hello.

531
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,120
It's this door I opened, but watch out for the tentacles.

532
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,440
Oh, there's lots of tentacles.

533
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:54,840
Okay.

534
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,300
Alright, it's time to go in.

535
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,460
There's a person.

536
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,380
There's a person.

537
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,200
Can we interact with her?

538
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,880
I cannot shut the door.

539
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,080
Someone else shut the door.

540
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,520
No, I think we're supposed to interact.

541
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,800
Alright, Snuffy.

542
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,320
Time for another big boy moment.

543
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,860
Go, Donkey!

544
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,760
You're the dad!

545
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,100
Don't you wanna be a man, Snuffy?

546
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,300
Go zap her with UV or something.

547
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,660
What just happened?

548
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,300
I did it!

549
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,240
Yeah, we're definitely not fucked for doing that or anything.

550
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Nah.

551
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,880
Is this door open?

552
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,740
Stop talking to him like that!

553
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,340
There's another mirror in here!

554
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,360
I don't understand this at all, you guys.

555
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,320
We got cake, we got booze.

556
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,660
You good?

557
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,220
Yeah!

558
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,360
We're going back through.

559
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:05,820
Okay!

560
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,840
They just totally missed it.

561
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,700
Weeheeheehee!

562
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,460
Why do we need cake?

563
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,840
We got everything.

564
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,840
Oh my god, it really does.

565
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,920
It really does look like...

566
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,040
I don't understand what this painting means.

567
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,020
Yeah.

568
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,580
I literally just did the Power Wash sim today for Shrek DLC.

569
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,580
It just came out.

570
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,700
Oh, there's feathers too?

571
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,900
What is this game?

572
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,180
Oh, I was gonna do that next week.

573
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:52,700
Was it good?

574
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,440
Yeah, but you need to... Okay.

575
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,400
The Shrek swamp is literally the last level.

576
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,240
So you have to go through so much just to get to the swamp.

577
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,760
I literally cleaned for four hours.

578
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,700
Oh my god.

579
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,740
I'm a bad one person.

580
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,580
Four hours just to get to the swamp?

581
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,480
I banned a person.

582
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,160
Oh, I know you banned grass.

583
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,980
No, there's three levels.

584
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,500
I think there's... I don't know if there's more than three.

585
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,440
But the first level is Lord Farquaad's place.

586
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,640
The second level is literally the Shrek honeymoon house.

587
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,720
And then the third one is the swamp.

588
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,920
Forget it.

589
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,100
Oh wait, this is a battery.

590
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,460
Maybe Snuffy, since you were using it earlier.

591
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,620
How did you know about grass?

592
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,940
Oh, because grass came to my chat.

593
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,220
And everyone was like, rip grass.

594
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,260
He knows what he did.

595
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,120
He knows what he did.

596
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,200
Oh, that's just a medkit.

597
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,480
Let's go see what they're doing.

598
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,220
He's creepy.

599
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,000
Let's not look at him anymore.

600
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,000
What is?

601
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,680
Oh, he's like waddling in there.

602
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,300
Oh, nope.

603
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:13,720
Thank you.

604
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,680
Look at that.

605
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,440
There's a head.

606
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,300
Oh my god.

607
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,640
I think we have to burn it with the...

608
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,160
Yeah, yeah.

609
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,740
Burn it.

610
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,920
Wait, is he biting my fucking ankles?

611
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,340
What am I hearing dying?

612
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,220
What the fuck is that noise?

613
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:28,900
What was that?

614
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,600
Oh, he's over there.

615
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,920
He's having like vigorous ghost sex in the walls.

616
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,440
Follow the head.

617
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,000
Look, he's crying.

618
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,300
You're torturing him.

619
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,520
What if we double team him?

620
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,060
You get him from the front.

621
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,000
I get him from behind.

622
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,680
Alright, where did he go?

623
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,000
Where did he go?

624
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,620
He's trying to go.

625
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,600
He's trying to go back to his...

626
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,420
Oh, Noki!

627
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,260
What the fuck?

628
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,520
Oh god.

629
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,120
I don't know if you can burn her.

630
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,440
I think you can only... maybe when she's aggravated, right?

631
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:04,820
Maybe.

632
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,220
Oh, she... you cannot.

633
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,520
I don't think you're supposed to touch her.

634
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,500
Oh my god.

635
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,520
I'm going into the...

636
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,420
Yeah, I'm with you.

637
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,020
I'm with you.

638
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,400
Am I alone now?

639
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

640
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,500
Alright, well, we have to go back so we can get to the head.

641
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,500
What do we do with the cake and stuff?

642
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,360
Maybe it's like...

643
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,800
I have no idea.

644
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,240
No, I don't know.

645
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,980
Alright, is it fine?

646
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,240
Is it safe, Stealthy?

647
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,840
Guys, I hear growling inside the mirror.

648
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,360
Okay, the ghost is...

649
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,700
I'll go.

650
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,600
Oh!

651
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,860
Oh, okay.

652
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,460
Oh.

653
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,120
I think she's fine.

654
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,700
I think she's fine.

655
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,640
Yeah, let's just go follow the head now.

656
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,700
Let's just go, yeah.

657
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,960
Let's just leave...

658
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,840
Leave her to her own devices and all.

659
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,500
Oh, there she is!

660
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,120
There's the head!

661
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,360
Okay, follow her.

662
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,480
Follow the head.

663
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,460
Where are you gonna go?

664
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,900
I wouldn't advise touching her.

665
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,740
Where is he going?

666
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,760
It's going backwards.

667
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,280
Are we supposed to kill it?

668
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,340
I don't know.

669
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,300
Wait, can we kill this?

670
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,600
Oh, I killed it!

671
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:11,660
Oh.

672
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:11,940
Oh.

673
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,260
Oh.

674
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,340
Ouch!

675
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:13,720
Ouch!

676
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,500
My doggie!

677
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,140
Doggie!

678
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,300
Doggie!

679
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,920
Oh, wait.

680
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,580
What is wrong?

681
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,180
Are you guys okay?

682
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,680
Wait, can you...

683
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,700
Wait, can someone...

684
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,400
I don't know what happened!

685
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,780
You're not supposed to touch it!

686
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,960
I don't know what happened!

687
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,380
Hold on, I left my medkit in there.

688
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,200
But I killed this.

689
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,380
You touched a lady.

690
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,740
She touched a woman.

691
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,580
No, I touched the tentacles again.

692
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,340
Oh, you gotta stop doing that.

693
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,300
The therapist told you, you gotta stop touching those tentacles.

694
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,600
I thought I killed them!

695
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:58,980
Man.

696
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,400
Wait, what did we do?

697
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,500
What did we do with the head guy?

698
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,240
He didn't seem to care that much.

699
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,380
No, he didn't really do anything.

700
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,940
Yeah, should we just follow the head?

701
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,680
We just follow it?

702
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,780
There's like a door that opened.

703
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,200
Oh, wait.

704
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,220
This door is open too.

705
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,780
Some of these doors weren't open before.

706
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,100
Oh, I wonder if we open them in the shadow, if it opens them here.

707
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,100
Oh, we're supposed to put the cake...

708
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:20,860
No, right?

709
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,800
We're supposed to put the cake back together.

710
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,040
On the plates, yeah.

711
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,840
That will stop the demons.

712
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,120
She knows it's like happy birthday!

713
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,340
Wait, I'm gonna go find a piece of cake and I'll come back through here.

714
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,200
Do we have any cake?

715
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,780
Do we have any cake?

716
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,360
No.

717
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,840
Looks delish.

718
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,100
Oh, we need a kitchen key.

719
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,320
Someone was crying.

720
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,160
Oh, that's the front door.

721
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,020
We opened the front door.

722
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,460
That's cool.

723
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,280
Oh, nice!

724
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,520
Nice.

725
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,300
Oh, I found a key!

726
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,620
What did he say?

727
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,120
Hot sauce?

728
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,540
Where are you?

729
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,960
Where are you?

730
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,660
What?

731
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,660
Who's the children?

732
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,340
Where is everybody?

733
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,300
Hot sauce.

734
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,300
I got the kitchen key!

735
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,260
Where is everybody?

736
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,560
You're upstairs?

737
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,860
I think they're upstairs.

738
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,120
They're in the walls.

739
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,500
What is happening?

740
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,620
Oh, hello.

741
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,020
Where?

742
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,860
What is the children?

743
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,320
Oh, our children, yes.

744
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,340
Sorry, I forgot I was a father.

745
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,780
Here it is.

746
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,580
What, is this the closet?

747
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,320
Oh no.

748
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,040
Yeah.

749
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,660
We gotta go to the closet and the kitchen.

750
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,740
You decided this.

751
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,620
This is the real Devour experience though, truly.

752
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,080
Yeah, actually.

753
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,320
Alright, following you.

754
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,020
There was a closet door somewhere.

755
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,960
Oh, what is this though?

756
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,780
Oh, this is where the wedding happened.

757
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,400
Yeah.

758
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,320
Oh, this is the wedding?

759
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,240
Woah, ok, this looks really fucking scary.

760
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,620
Oh, there's the dead husband!

761
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,440
More dead lady?

762
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,600
Oh my god, it opens.

763
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,900
It's a development room.

764
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:26,960
Photographs.

765
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,780
I hear something nasty in here.

766
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,040
Oh, it's pictures of the deceased people.

767
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,840
Picture.

768
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,880
Oh, there's a pumpkin.

769
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,720
I say so, maybe do it.

770
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,680
I say so, maybe do it.

771
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,180
After getting their heads back there.

772
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,100
Yeah.

773
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,740
This is complicated.

774
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,280
There's so much here.

775
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,280
It was like a little bacon.

776
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,550
I couldn't tell at all.

777
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,360
Yeah, it looked like a prune.

778
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:20,660
Oh.

779
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,120
The bride has like a flower crown, I guess.

780
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:26,720
I don't know.

781
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,400
I guess so.

782
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,980
Maybe like, maybe it's this guy.

783
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,020
Which one?

784
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,920
That guy, because I think like the other one.

785
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,380
Are we supposed to do something with the photos?

786
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,940
Maybe we're supposed to chase the head.

787
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,000
We're supposed to chase the head to the bodies.

788
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,080
Oh god.

789
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,040
I don't think so.

790
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,240
Then why the fuck would you do that?

791
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,680
I like the shuffle room.

792
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,540
Just the absolute...

793
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,520
Can you like put the soil back in?

794
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,460
Oh yeah, try and bury it.

795
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,980
I'm pretty sure we're supposed to bring the heads to there and then bury it.

796
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,300
How?

797
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,300
But he runs at random.

798
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,680
Oh there's another...

799
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,000
There's a maid!

800
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,720
Oh my god.

801
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,340
A ghost maid.

802
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,020
That's you.

803
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,340
That's you before you died.

804
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,720
This is literally me!

805
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,440
That's literally you!

806
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,320
Okay guys.

807
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
Bury me.

808
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,120
Bury me, doggie.

809
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,020
It's true.

810
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:41,560
Oh!

811
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,020
Lime got the downstairs bathroom.

812
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,780
Oh yeah, show me where the closet is.

813
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,100
Downstairs.

814
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,560
The kitchen key.

815
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,200
Yeah.

816
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,440
Since we opened this area, maybe the ghost will run here.

817
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,620
Maybe the ghost head will run here now.

818
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,400
Is this the groom?

819
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:01,940
Oh, pumpkin.

820
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,520
I just like collecting these.

821
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,620
Why are there so many dead...

822
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,140
There were not this many photos.

823
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,340
There were not this many photos of people.

824
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,260
Do you know where I work?

825
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,500
That would be so gross.

826
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,600
Imagine you die in a freaking bottle accident and you are buried there with a spatula in your hand.

827
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,520
Do we burn the bodies with alcohol?

828
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,580
Maybe.

829
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,220
I'm totally down for burning them.

830
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,760
Me too.

831
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,140
Oh, this is... okay.

832
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,480
We are back at the beginning.

833
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,140
We started that.

834
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,240
That's where we've been there.

835
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,360
That's where we started.

836
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,660
There is a grave here too.

837
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:45,980
Really?

838
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,920
This is where they summon Azazel.

839
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:51,820
Azazel.

840
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,740
This is where they found her.

841
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,520
We were here.

842
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,420
Yeah, that's what we were saying.

843
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,460
So we found a loop-de-loop.

844
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,620
Yeah, there is a little loop.

845
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,400
We found a loop-de-loop.

846
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,640
Okay, chat.

847
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,940
Is the volume better now?

848
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,040
Is my sound better?

849
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,660
Can you hear everybody?

850
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,140
I think this game's problem is this tunnel could collapse in a moment.

851
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,120
Are people too loud?

852
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,360
Wait, we can open the kitchen key.

853
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,060
Manhattan Kitchen.

854
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,980
Oh yeah, where is the kitchen?

855
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,540
Oh, we have a kitchen.

856
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,380
It is right here.

857
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,600
It will all make sense after we get into the kitchen.

858
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:21,520
Where?

859
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,180
Oh, right here?

860
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,640
Nice.

861
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,720
Good thing I didn't buy the pig.

862
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,400
He would've been so sad.

863
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,720
Wait, let's get to the other world.

864
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,640
Wait, there is the other world.

865
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,460
Yeah.

866
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,600
Alright.

867
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,640
I'm going in.

868
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,980
I'm going ghost.

869
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,720
Oh my god.

870
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,540
Is this safe?

871
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,420
It was like... Oh, there is a head in here.

872
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,260
He can't get out.

873
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,100
Hit him with the shovel.

874
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,980
Or let him out.

875
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,780
Why did you let him out?

876
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,360
Presumably we have to let them out to free them or some shit.

877
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:07,880
Maybe.

878
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,900
Walk your dog.

879
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,380
Go ahead.

880
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,260
Take him outside.

881
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,520
He went back into the kitchen.

882
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,320
Wait, what do you mean we are hurting them?

883
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,560
What is that sound?

884
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,460
What is that noise?

885
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,680
What is that noise?

886
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,540
Yeah, she like hits her head on the wall and stuff.

887
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,300
She is kind of crazy.

888
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,240
He is right here.

889
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,680
Take him to the outside.

890
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,080
We got the outside door.

891
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,340
We should take him to the outside like a good dog.

892
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,160
Good dog.

893
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,640
Good dog.

894
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,340
Wait, why do we have two heads now?

895
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:52,820
Oh god.

896
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,220
Because we found two heads.

897
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,280
Yeah, there is like a second head.

898
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,220
Wait, try the cake.

899
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,080
Who has the cake?

900
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,800
Oh, I found a third head!

901
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,380
Oh my god.

902
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,440
Wait, they are meeting.

903
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,360
The dogs are meeting.

904
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,300
Let them sniff each other.

905
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,120
Let them sniff each other?

906
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,420
Yeah.

907
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,540
My dogs.

908
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,020
My dogs.

909
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,760
We are the worst dog walkers ever.

910
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,000
What's going on?

911
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,340
I think we are in trouble.

912
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,300
As long as we are here we will be fine, right?

913
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,300
I don't know.

914
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,760
Let's just hide in the kitchen.

915
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,900
Why did you get rid of your weapon?

916
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,040
It doesn't work!

917
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,800
Somebody said we should feed them cake.

918
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
Oh, feed them cake?

919
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,200
Yeah, they said to feed them cake.

920
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,020
Are you guys ok?

921
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,300
No.

922
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,220
No?

923
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,960
What happened?

924
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,900
Oh, she's in here.

925
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,960
Go, go, go!

926
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,660
I got you!

927
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,240
I got you!

928
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,540
I got you!

929
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,400
I got you, son!

930
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,180
Are you ok?

931
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:24,760
Live?

932
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,260
Oh, there you are.

933
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,640
She got better.

934
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,080
She got better.

935
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,160
Do you want the cake, little guy?

936
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,360
Do you want it?

937
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,600
Oh yeah, give him the cake.

938
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,000
GG!

939
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,080
GG!

940
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,740
Baby!

941
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,160
Baby!

942
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,900
Ok, there we go.

943
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,700
Oh my god, he's coming.

944
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:55,640
Little dog!

945
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,740
Little dog!

946
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,220
Go, go!

947
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,720
Go, go, go!

948
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,620
What does that mean?

949
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,040
I grabbed him!

950
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,220
I have the human!

951
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,560
I have the head!

952
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,740
You have the head.

953
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,680
I have him in my inventory.

954
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,140
I don't know.

955
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,380
The witch is in the real world now.

956
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,780
She came through the mirror and killed Snuffy and now she's out there.

957
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,900
And Snuffy is for some reason still alive.

958
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,300
Snuffy, can you go back through the mirror?

959
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,200
Do you die again?

960
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,300
No, I revived her.

961
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,160
I revived her.

962
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,760
Oh, ok.

963
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,200
You fucking disintegrated on my screen.

964
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,220
Ok, so there's bodies...

965
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,700
Ew, his spine is just like following you.

966
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,120
All we have to do is...

967
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,060
We have to go outside...

968
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,300
There's bodies outside so we piece those heads to that body.

969
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,280
Oh boy.

970
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,200
I think they're all the same head model.

971
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,660
Yeah, I think it doesn't matter who we do.

972
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,260
Ok, so we go back to the real world and find a grave.

973
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,200
Oh god.

974
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,840
Wait, everyone should grab a head.

975
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,520
Everyone should grab a head probably, right?

976
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:05,740
Yeah.

977
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,180
Uh oh.

978
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:08,960
I hear her.

979
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,440
Oh wait, here's a guy.

980
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,000
Here's a guy.

981
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,240
And... cake.

982
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,780
Wait, who has the shovel?

983
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,700
It's in the normal world.

984
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,660
It's in the normal world.

985
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,660
The shovel is right here.

986
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,720
Ok, it's in the real world though.

987
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:29,620
Ok.

988
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,680
I'm gonna go put this in a body.

989
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,540
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna go do.

990
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,260
I'm scared of the lady though.

991
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,080
I'm scared of her.

992
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:43,600
Where?

993
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:44,940
Where?

994
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:45,200
Where?

995
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,360
Oh, the head must be cleansed before playing.

996
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,440
What the hell does this mean?

997
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,020
With alcohol maybe?

998
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,340
Maybe, let's try it.

999
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,380
This is so much.

1000
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,120
Ok, there's like alcohol everywhere.

1001
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:08,320
Yeah.

1002
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,620
Oh my god, how much is there to do?

1003
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,120
Oh, here's some.

1004
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,140
Ok, put it in.

1005
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:20,980
Alright.

1006
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,600
If it can clean woods, it can clean heads.

1007
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:25,900
Ok.

1008
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,560
Oh, oh my god, I'm cleaning it.

1009
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,940
I'm cleaning it.

1010
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,040
I have a head.

1011
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,160
She's a lady.

1012
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,480
Oh, she's beautiful.

1013
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,500
Who do I put this on?

1014
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,580
So we can look at it.

1015
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,760
Oh, wow!

1016
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,880
Do you think that's a maid?

1017
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,060
Wait, how do I grab it?

1018
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,480
Oh, someone else grabbed it.

1019
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,340
There you go.

1020
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,160
It's ok.

1021
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,060
For some reason it won't let me... Oh, there it is.

1022
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,820
We need to go find her now.

1023
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:12,340
Ok.

1024
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,360
We can look at the pictures again.

1025
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,400
There weren't that many pictures though.

1026
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,560
There weren't that many pictures.

1027
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,860
What if we... It's fine.

1028
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,780
They don't care whose head they get.

1029
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,640
Like, whatever.

1030
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,600
Is she there?

1031
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:32,740
Oh, ok.

1032
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,320
Let's go this way.

1033
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,040
Oh, nevermind.

1034
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:40,440
Let's go.

1035
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,160
We don't have stamina to jump.

1036
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,160
Oh, we can't go out.

1037
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,020
It's a one-way entrance.

1038
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:51,860
Oh my god, ok.

1039
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,380
She can only kill one person.

1040
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:56,660
Did she leave?

1041
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,240
Ok guys, come on, come on.

1042
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,420
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1043
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,160
I don't have the key.

1044
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,540
I'm gonna grab... Yeah, grab cake.

1045
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,540
Grab anything you see.

1046
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,960
There's another piece of cake here.

1047
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:05,980
Oh, here!

1048
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,720
Wait, who had the downstairs bathroom key?

1049
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:08,840
Lime had it, right?

1050
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:09,960
This one, this one.

1051
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,000
This is the downstairs bathroom.

1052
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,660
Yeah, one of the heads might be stuck in the bathroom.

1053
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:14,740
There we go.

1054
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,920
I should find where to put this one, though, before I get killed.

1055
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,420
There is a cake in here.

1056
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,320
And a ducky.

1057
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,540
Oh, maybe it's in the ghost world?

1058
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,940
Yeah, there might be a head in here.

1059
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,640
There's another cake.

1060
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,260
I'll grab it.

1061
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,540
Oh, there's more alcohol in here.

1062
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,080
Nice.

1063
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,320
How do we get to the maid area?

1064
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,460
It was like in the back of the house.

1065
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,680
I think it's the maid.

1066
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,560
It has to be.

1067
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,420
Try putting it on this person.

1068
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,580
Lime did.

1069
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,900
Oh my god, so we actually have to guess?

1070
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,760
No, it's in the photos, remember?

1071
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,280
The photos that we saw there.

1072
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,920
Yeah, but there weren't that many photos.

1073
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,820
Is she there?

1074
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,320
I think yeah.

1075
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,620
Are you guys okay?

1076
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,400
Are you guys okay?

1077
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,380
Oh, hello.

1078
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,780
What's she doing?

1079
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,440
She's crawling on her knees.

1080
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,120
Hey there.

1081
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,860
Are you okay, ma'am?

1082
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,540
Relatable.

1083
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,880
A week of hard work right there.

1084
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,800
She's going up the corpse and it's freaking out.

1085
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:35,580
This way.

1086
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,780
A corpse?

1087
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,700
Oh, it's winning its head!

1088
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:40,560
Oh my god!

1089
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:41,820
Is it the maid?

1090
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,820
Oh my god!

1091
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,000
Bury me!

1092
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,280
Bury me!

1093
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,780
Bury me!

1094
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,960
Bury me!

1095
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,760
Bury me!

1096
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:06,660
Run!

1097
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:07,960
Run!

1098
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,160
Run!

1099
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:09,900
Run!

1100
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:16,990
Hello?

1101
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,810
Maybe we go to the mirror world.

1102
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,910
Yeah, we all kinda split.

1103
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:24,090
We scooby-dooed it.

1104
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,410
I hear her screaming in there.

1105
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,010
You think she's gonna stay aggro forever?

1106
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:37,470
I can hear her freaking.

1107
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,130
Oh, I hear her too.

1108
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,430
Oh, maybe we should go.

1109
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:43,010
Bird.

1110
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,470
Is the bird indicative of anything?

1111
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,390
Oh, it's coming!

1112
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:47,710
Yeah!

1113
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:50,570
It's an enemy!

1114
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,430
Oh, there's a...

1115
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:55,110
I have cake.

1116
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,030
We gotta go to the other world.

1117
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,430
Yeah, it was like hard to...

1118
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,050
I don't know.

1119
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,030
Are you guys dead?

1120
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,250
I think we gotta go to the other world.

1121
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:15,750
Like the mirror world.

1122
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,070
Oh my god, she's really freaking out in there.

1123
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,880
I don't wanna get jumpscared.

1124
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,000
She's freaking me out.

1125
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:30,940
I'm being a baby.

1126
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,160
Oh shoot.

1127
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,320
Lime!

1128
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,580
Don't die!

1129
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,560
Lime, are you dead?

1130
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:41,540
Oh, OK.

1131
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,440
This way!

1132
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,000
This way!

1133
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,260
Oh my god.

1134
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,620
Are we OK?

1135
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,760
Oh, I hear them!

1136
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,100
What the hell is that?

1137
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:06,860
What's going on?

1138
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,400
Oh, I think she's back to normal.

1139
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,800
I think she's back to normal!

1140
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,200
No!

1141
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,760
Watch out!

1142
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,140
Watch out!

1143
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:17,480
Behind you!

1144
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:17,860
Behind you!

1145
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,180
I didn't run away!

1146
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,080
We were running together!

1147
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,800
You left me!

1148
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:26,720
What do you mean?

1149
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,800
I said Lime, let's go!

1150
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:32,320
I was begging you to use the flashlight on her!

1151
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,000
Oh, I don't think it works, does it?

1152
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:35,860
I didn't.

1153
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,800
I stopped her with the flashlight when mine came back enough.

1154
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,180
Oh, she's down the... Oh my god, that looks so scary.

1155
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,300
Let's go to the other world.

1156
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,940
I heard Snuffy and Doki down there.

1157
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:48,700
Oh my god.

1158
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,200
Lime, I'm going!

1159
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,420
Hello?

1160
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,160
I'm gonna grab this guy.

1161
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:01,560
I do.

1162
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:02,540
There you go.

1163
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:03,660
Little guy.

1164
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,060
Eat some cake.

1165
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,460
Eat it.

1166
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,420
Eat it on up.

1167
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,840
Is Doki alive?

1168
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,660
I kind of heard some voices earlier, so maybe.

1169
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,560
Oh, that might have been me and Lime.

1170
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,240
I thought she was with you.

1171
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,540
Doki?

1172
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,340
Wait, I see a flashlight!

1173
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,220
I see a flashlight!

1174
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,160
Hello?

1175
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,020
Hi!

1176
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,440
Are you guys good?

1177
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,120
What do you mean, Doki?

1178
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,600
She's like, in this hallway.

1179
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,360
But she sounds like she's calm now.

1180
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,380
Did you guys chill her out?

1181
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,020
I used the UV light on her.

1182
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,360
Oh, okay.

1183
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:52,260
So, like, we clean a bunch of heads and then drop... put it in the altar after we clean them.

1184
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,520
So then, like, you know how when we put the head to the body, they get angrier?

1185
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,260
So all we have to do is just, like, have a pile of clean heads at the altar.

1186
00:54:59,720 --> 00:54:59,960
Okay.

1187
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,220
I have a head currently.

1188
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,160
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1189
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:05,740
Come with me.

1190
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,580
I cleansed... I have alcohol already.

1191
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,220
Oh, okay, okay.

1192
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:09,900
To the altar.

1193
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:10,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1194
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:11,520
Come here.

1195
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:11,860
Alright.

1196
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,360
I'll grab this one, too, just cause...

1197
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:16,740
Yeah, yeah.

1198
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:17,980
We can head downstairs.

1199
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,120
Alright, alright, alright.

1200
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:19,960
Downstairs.

1201
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,240
Alright.

1202
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,440
I thought the cake would make them sleep.

1203
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,380
I dropped a head in the tomb, by the way, because I didn't realize it would run.

1204
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,640
I think she only gets aggroed...

1205
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,620
I think she only gets aggroed once we bury the body.

1206
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,680
So we can probably attach the heads and then go around and bury the body.

1207
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,660
Oh, that's true!

1208
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:37,680
That's true!

1209
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,420
Yeah, we can do that.

1210
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,620
I'll fill it up again, too.

1211
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,140
I think a little guy just escaped.

1212
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,460
There's a head walking around.

1213
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,080
Yeah, no, that was me.

1214
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,160
I didn't realize he starts moving.

1215
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,680
I didn't realize he starts moving.

1216
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,100
Oh, yeah, you gotta cleanse him.

1217
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:58,040
After I dropped him, I thought I could just put him there.

1218
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,400
Wait, let's grab him.

1219
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,140
Where is he?

1220
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,860
I don't have a cake, though.

1221
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,720
Oh, we need more cake!

1222
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,160
Yeah, yeah, we need more cake.

1223
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:05,220
Boys!

1224
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:05,800
Oh, no!

1225
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,180
Oh, but...

1226
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,320
Subby, Subby, Subby!

1227
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:08,720
Wash his head!

1228
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,280
Wash his head!

1229
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,440
Okay, okay, okay.

1230
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,260
Oh, that's the cook!

1231
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,260
This is the cook!

1232
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:13,940
This is the cook?

1233
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,340
Yeah, we can attach.

1234
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,800
I'm just thinking when we attach them, do you think they'll run away because they're vibrating?

1235
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,600
No, they're chained down!

1236
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,660
I got John Alpha male over here.

1237
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,260
John Alpha?

1238
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,700
John Alpha male.

1239
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,480
What does he look like?

1240
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,280
Oh my god!

1241
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:29,700
Oh, wow!

1242
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,080
Maybe the groom, then?

1243
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:31,400
Maybe.

1244
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,800
Yeah, yeah, that could be the groom.

1245
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,040
Oh, she's gonna get excited!

1246
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,200
Whoa!

1247
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,960
You're gonna be all...

1248
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,920
Let's make a circle of heads.

1249
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,100
We're gonna induce more trauma than like a ghost already has.

1250
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,260
It looks like the start of...

1251
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,400
You wanna just leave them here until we're ready?

1252
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,240
Maybe they can kiss.

1253
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,000
Make them kiss.

1254
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,000
Wait, how do you hold it?

1255
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,540
Who's a bigger freak?

1256
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,480
Us or the ghost?

1257
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,160
I'm literally just like collecting severed heads.

1258
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:08,440
I'm playing Barbie dolls with it.

1259
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,440
I'm playing Barbie dolls with the head.

1260
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,780
Oh, this one head over here is like gagging.

1261
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,100
Yeah, he's still waiting for it.

1262
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,840
He's pouting, he's like in the corner like, I'm upset.

1263
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,840
We're chasing him back into the...

1264
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,500
Go back!

1265
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,800
Go back!

1266
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,380
Oh my God.

1267
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,460
Chase him back!

1268
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:36,980
Chase him back!

1269
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:38,940
Oh, he got out.

1270
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,500
He got out.

1271
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,240
We have one job.

1272
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,920
Okay, I'm back here I guess.

1273
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,380
Me too.

1274
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,540
Wait, is she in this world or the other?

1275
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,120
I can't tell.

1276
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,060
I can't tell either.

1277
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:52,880
I never know.

1278
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,580
I'm just scared forever.

1279
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,280
Is it really loud?

1280
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,220
I think she's in the inside world.

1281
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,340
I think she's in the real world.

1282
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:01,920
Where's Naimo?

1283
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:02,620
Did she die?

1284
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:26,130
Hello?

1285
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,050
I just watched Doki die.

1286
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:32,570
Oh, that sucks.

1287
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:33,170
What killed her?

1288
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:34,930
The ghost lady.

1289
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:40,910
But we can probably get a medkit and bring her back, I think.

1290
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,030
Oh, there she is.

1291
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:43,770
Hi Doki!

1292
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:52,890
In the other world?

1293
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,630
That's so sad.

1294
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:01,850
Oh, you got a medkit.

1295
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:02,230
Nice.

1296
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,530
We're gonna run out of medkits.

1297
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:06,530
I'm scared.

1298
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:09,950
Two of them were me.

1299
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:12,910
Oh my god, I got the head.

1300
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:18,210
I was nearly against the mirror and then she fucking jumped out from the mirror.

1301
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:20,310
Yeah, I know.

1302
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:21,190
I was right there.

1303
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,250
You watched it happen.

1304
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:25,810
Yeah, I literally watched it happen.

1305
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:28,570
How do we get to the...

1306
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:29,570
I got one of them.

1307
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:32,750
Got her.

1308
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,770
Wow, she sounds a little...

1309
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:42,950
You did that.

1310
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:44,870
You did that.

1311
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,190
At least she's having a good time.

1312
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:48,790
You didn't complain.

1313
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:50,230
Oh, nice.

1314
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:50,850
Oh, wait.

1315
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:51,730
I thought we were waiting.

1316
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,370
I think if we put the heads on, it's okay.

1317
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:57,790
She aggroes when we bury the body.

1318
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:58,690
Yeah, yeah.

1319
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:01,090
Okay, they're fine like that.

1320
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:01,570
Probably.

1321
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:04,150
This head does not belong here.

1322
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:08,710
I'm gonna go to the back and see if I can find...

1323
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:14,030
There was this one, right?

1324
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,910
Oh my god, I got him.

1325
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,610
I got him.

1326
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,070
I got him.

1327
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:22,610
It was the groom.

1328
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:24,090
I almost said the broom.

1329
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:28,930
Wait, do you guys...

1330
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:30,210
I got the groom.

1331
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:31,130
Yeah, it was the groom.

1332
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:32,290
I don't see him.

1333
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:33,190
Wait, I don't see him.

1334
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:33,870
He's right over here.

1335
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:35,650
Oh, there he is.

1336
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:36,150
Look at him.

1337
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:38,830
He doesn't say anything.

1338
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:41,030
Oh, he does.

1339
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,230
He's just very quiet.

1340
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,990
Yeah, he's just like... He's whimpering a little bit.

1341
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:49,610
Whimper a little bit.

1342
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:53,230
Oh, I found more cake.

1343
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:54,190
Oh, nice.

1344
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,050
Wait, we need that so we can get that guy.

1345
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:59,230
The one in...

1346
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:02,590
There's three slices in here, actually.

1347
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:06,630
Yeah, yeah.

1348
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:09,470
Oh, okay.

1349
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,410
But we'll aggro her.

1350
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:13,690
Yeah.

1351
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:17,150
Me too.

1352
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:20,670
Where's the one... Where's the head that's in here?

1353
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,150
He's over here, right?

1354
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,370
No, we had one here, right?

1355
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:26,450
Right here.

1356
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:28,210
I got him, I got him.

1357
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:31,170
Yeah, remember?

1358
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:32,350
We were telling you.

1359
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:39,670
I think we accidentally brought him here and then when you dropped him down and...

1360
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,070
Oh my god, Doki.

1361
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:48,950
You're taking this old man roleplay way too far.

1362
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:51,830
Okay.

1363
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:55,310
Okay, we have alcohol.

1364
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:55,930
Oh, yeah.

1365
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:56,670
Put it in.

1366
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:57,550
I got the alcohol.

1367
01:01:57,850 --> 01:01:58,270
Alright.

1368
01:01:58,450 --> 01:01:59,330
I have extra too.

1369
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:01,570
My early onset dementia.

1370
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,190
Look, I'm old right now.

1371
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,290
I'm playing an old cat.

1372
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:05,030
I'm just roleplaying.

1373
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:07,610
I'm just roleplaying as the old man.

1374
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:09,050
Look at him squirm.

1375
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:10,410
Oh, it's so gross.

1376
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,490
Do you think Snoopy's dead over there?

1377
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:13,190
Wait, dead?

1378
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:14,130
Snoopy's dead.

1379
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,350
Wait, what did she do?

1380
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,050
What happened?

1381
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:16,770
Snoopy!

1382
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:19,650
Oh, I wonder if it was a bat or a crow.

1383
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:23,450
Oh, I have the lady!

1384
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:24,990
I have the lady in the backyard.

1385
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:25,970
I'm gonna go put her on.

1386
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:32,940
Hi!

1387
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,040
Hello.

1388
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,120
What happened?

1389
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,220
You're like really groaning.

1390
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,980
I can't tell.

1391
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,900
I don't know where she is.

1392
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:58,450
Yeah, yeah, I got her.

1393
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:00,490
I'm scared.

1394
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:02,130
Yeah.

1395
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:06,690
I got alcohol.

1396
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:10,710
Do you think we can hide in here and she'll come?

1397
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:14,870
Okay, okay.

1398
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,130
Yeah.

1399
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:22,130
She's upstairs?

1400
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:30,470
I don't think it stops her.

1401
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:32,210
Oh, it did stop her.

1402
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:41,410
She's like still around, but she's not pissed.

1403
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:44,370
She's back to normal.

1404
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,650
Oh here we go, here we go.

1405
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:53,830
There you go.

1406
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:54,110
Okay.

1407
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:57,110
Oh!

1408
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,380
Here it is!

1409
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,440
Oh my god.

1410
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,580
We have two cakes for...oh shit, there's a crow.

1411
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:15,660
We have two cakes for a head, so we gotta go to the other world.

1412
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:16,920
Yeah, let's go to the other world.

1413
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:21,320
There's one...the one that I tripped and fell is upstairs.

1414
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,080
Oh, I hear her crying.

1415
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,540
She's in the ghost world.

1416
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:25,960
Oh, okay.

1417
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,840
Watch out for the...

1418
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,560
I have cake.

1419
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,660
Did we get all of them in here?

1420
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,640
This one...

1421
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,960
Did we get all the heads?

1422
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,060
Any head?

1423
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:48,520
Any head around?

1424
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,920
Guys, I really don't want to be jump scared.

1425
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,840
I'm gonna turn down the volume a little bit.

1426
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,720
Sound effects, maybe?

1427
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,940
I had to turn it up, because I turned everything up.

1428
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,280
What's going on?

1429
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,840
Oh, whoa, be careful, be careful.

1430
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,060
Don't die to that.

1431
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,980
Oh, you can't go down there in this world.

1432
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,000
Yeah?

1433
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:23,880
What about me?

1434
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,760
How many heads we got?

1435
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:30,040
Hello?

1436
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,940
Do you have the upstairs bathroom key?

1437
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:33,360
Maybe?

1438
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:35,080
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we got it.

1439
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:35,680
It's up here.

1440
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:36,080
Where?

1441
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:36,460
In here?

1442
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,520
Right side, right side.

1443
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:38,220
No, no, no, right side.

1444
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:38,500
Here, here.

1445
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,040
Here?

1446
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:39,840
The door over here.

1447
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:40,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1448
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:41,100
Left, left.

1449
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:41,500
Right here.

1450
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,200
Oh, here?

1451
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:43,800
Oh, no.

1452
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:44,300
I don't have it.

1453
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:44,820
Oh, you did.

1454
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:45,460
Oh, what?

1455
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,160
I remember you had an upstairs something.

1456
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,380
I have a kitchen and closet.

1457
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,480
I have the closet key.

1458
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:52,780
Oh, okay.

1459
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,960
I have cake if we need another head tonight.

1460
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1461
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:56,500
Do we have another head?

1462
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:57,980
I have cake also.

1463
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:58,880
I've never seen one.

1464
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,100
How many have we had so far?

1465
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:02,920
Four, maybe?

1466
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,780
I'm holding one right now, so...

1467
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,860
I'm gonna go to the other world to clean this one, though.

1468
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,000
No head?

1469
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:14,680
No head?

1470
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,440
Where'd your head go?

1471
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,180
Where's your head at?

1472
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:20,200
Alright.

1473
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:21,140
Kitchen?

1474
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,820
I feel like we should get one more at least.

1475
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,840
I feel like so, too.

1476
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,080
Do you know... Wait, you know where the closet was, didn't you?

1477
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:29,800
Yeah, it was at the bottom.

1478
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,160
The closet was at the bottom.

1479
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:32,420
I don't think I unlocked it.

1480
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,420
It's down here.

1481
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,140
Or did I?

1482
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,000
It's open on this side, but it might not be open on the other side.

1483
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,040
Oh, wait.

1484
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:40,700
I think I did.

1485
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:41,180
Never mind.

1486
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,180
I did open it.

1487
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,160
Oh, that's a bad word.

1488
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:45,320
Wow!

1489
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,420
All the YouTube streamers demonetized!

1490
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:52,220
Oh my god!

1491
01:06:53,900 --> 01:07:01,480
Oh, I hear her banging her head.

1492
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,960
There's gotta be... We gotta get the other keys then, I think.

1493
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:07,300
Maybe.

1494
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:14,450
I'm gonna grab this medkit instead of the cake.

1495
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:15,290
Just in case.

1496
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,830
I'm following live.

1497
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,970
I know, right?

1498
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:30,750
She's fine, I think.

1499
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:38,750
There's more alcohol in here.

1500
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,030
No?

1501
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:43,210
No?

1502
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:46,950
What did you say?

1503
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:48,530
What?

1504
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:51,970
Oh my god!

1505
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,710
No way!

1506
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:54,190
Oh my god.

1507
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:55,610
What?

1508
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:58,850
The crows take the head if you don't bury them.

1509
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:00,890
Well, that makes sense.

1510
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:05,070
Do you think there will be crows taking the head at the altar then?

1511
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:06,390
Maybe we should just...

1512
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,370
Just like stockpile heads at the altar.

1513
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:12,370
It's really easy to calm her down, so we just calm her down.

1514
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:13,930
Yeah, let's calm her down real quick.

1515
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:16,270
Wait, that just lifted up.

1516
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:18,710
Yeah, she did that earlier.

1517
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:19,370
Oh really?

1518
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,110
Is she coming this way?

1519
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:22,270
Where is she?

1520
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:24,670
Oh no.

1521
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:25,990
Here she is.

1522
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:29,250
Yeah, calm down.

1523
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:32,610
Little bride, go back to sleep.

1524
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:36,830
Little bride, go back to sleep.

1525
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:42,470
What?

1526
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:46,110
This doesn't concern you, dude.

1527
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:49,050
Yeah, get out of here.

1528
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:51,410
You don't need to be here.

1529
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,510
Go away.

1530
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:58,690
Let's put the head... Wait, does that...

1531
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:00,990
I think they will still grab them though, right?

1532
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:02,710
Even if we...

1533
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:03,150
Stock...

1534
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:04,930
I'm gonna go bury them.

1535
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:06,590
Ok, she's gonna aggro.

1536
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:07,370
She's gonna aggro.

1537
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:09,310
What the?

1538
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:11,090
Wait, what?

1539
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:11,810
What just happened?

1540
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:15,750
I don't know.

1541
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:16,650
She didn't aggro.

1542
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:18,350
Oh, nevermind.

1543
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:19,570
Goddammit.

1544
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:22,890
I spoke too soon.

1545
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:25,610
Ok, you're ready to beam her?

1546
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:27,830
Yeah, we got her.

1547
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,290
Light her up.

1548
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:34,150
This is the light her up section.

1549
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:34,510
Wait!

1550
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:35,950
Come here, come here.

1551
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:40,930
Oh my god!

1552
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,010
I think...

1553
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:56,430
Where are you?

1554
01:09:56,990 --> 01:10:01,290
Wait, where did Snuffy go?

1555
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:02,210
I can heal her.

1556
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:05,950
The UVA pissed her off that time.

1557
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:08,850
I think it's supposed to get harder as the game goes on.

1558
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:09,750
No, it is.

1559
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:10,190
It is.

1560
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:14,190
The more heads we're returning, the more power she unlocks.

1561
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:14,930
Where is Snuffy?

1562
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,330
We have to go to the other world.

1563
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:19,370
Ok, let's stockpile heads in the altar.

1564
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:21,630
Can you pick up this head?

1565
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:25,850
We'll put all the heads in the altar and then we'll start...

1566
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:28,430
There's no way the crows will head to the altar.

1567
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:29,630
Yeah, true, true.

1568
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:32,010
It's our safe place.

1569
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:35,450
The crows can't go in because there's God on our side.

1570
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:38,170
Azazel is on our side, actually.

1571
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:40,390
I thought you loved Satan.

1572
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:43,850
You don't love God, you love Satan.

1573
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,150
Wait, who took the other head?

1574
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:48,270
Oh, you have it?

1575
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,050
No, Lime has it.

1576
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:54,350
I think she went to stockpile it.

1577
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:56,210
I see Snuffy, I'm gonna go heal her.

1578
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:00,790
Snuffy!

1579
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:04,450
I'm coming for you!

1580
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:07,610
My savior!

1581
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:13,970
Oh, sorry.

1582
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:14,950
Wait, how do I heal you?

1583
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:18,650
Wait, how do I heal you?

1584
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:19,550
Press E.

1585
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:20,110
Oh, E?

1586
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:21,750
Hold it down.

1587
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:23,170
Oh, it's not working.

1588
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:27,670
Oh, there we go, there we go.

1589
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:27,950
Oh, ok.

1590
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,970
I might wanna run.

1591
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:41,030
She is so rude!

1592
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:44,510
I can't see anything with this flashlight.

1593
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:47,030
Yeah, let's just go to the crypt.

1594
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,610
How many bodies do we have left?

1595
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,710
She was like, I'm gonna get you guys again.

1596
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:02,110
And then she just broke my neck.

1597
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:03,370
She's like, oh, you guys win.

1598
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:04,550
Just kidding.

1599
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:09,550
Yeah, she was pacified and then she went, haha, that's a joke.

1600
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:10,850
And actually just murdered Snuffy.

1601
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:13,330
Yeah, I think it only stuns her now.

1602
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:14,870
It doesn't actually pacify her.

1603
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:18,450
We'll stockpile all the heads in this quarter.

1604
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:20,190
It'll be fine.

1605
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,830
We just need to find more heads.

1606
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,350
I have not seen five heads.

1607
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:26,330
There's no way.

1608
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:27,590
There's a lot of bodies.

1609
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,170
I've never seen that many heads.

1610
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:32,490
They're all just trapped in one bathroom.

1611
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:34,030
Serious, actually though.

1612
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:40,010
Ok, you're not safe in the other world either, everybody.

1613
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:41,650
Red eyes can't be stunned.

1614
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:44,070
She doesn't have red eyes.

1615
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:46,670
Red eyes can't be stunned.

1616
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:49,330
The lore, the...

1617
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:51,230
I hear her screaming.

1618
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,790
Yeah, that's when you know she's extra Bridezilla.

1619
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:55,230
Should we go into the other world?

1620
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:57,850
I guess.

1621
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:00,930
That's her outside.

1622
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:04,110
Help!

1623
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:06,150
Help!

1624
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:06,670
Shine!

1625
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:06,990
Shine!

1626
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:07,310
Shine!

1627
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:12,030
I found a head!

1628
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:13,150
There's a head guy right here!

1629
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:14,670
There's another head.

1630
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:20,330
Does anybody have cake?

1631
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,510
I don't have cake.

1632
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:27,610
Ok, time to find cake.

1633
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:31,670
You found some?

1634
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:33,850
No, I found alcohol.

1635
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:37,910
Did I just hear her?

1636
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:42,570
They got this head.

1637
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:43,590
I'll take it to the altar.

1638
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:47,630
Was that the head from the altar?

1639
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:50,170
No, this is not the one from the altar.

1640
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:50,950
Ok.

1641
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:52,650
It better not be.

1642
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:55,090
Wait, they can come in here though, don't they?

1643
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:57,510
We've zapped them from in here before.

1644
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:03,450
But this is a different head, but they can definitely come in here.

1645
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:07,050
Yeah, but there's no way they can find it.

1646
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:07,590
There's no way.

1647
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:08,770
This is our quarter.

1648
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,270
It's our safe space.

1649
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,590
We gotta find...

1650
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:17,510
We gotta find cake.

1651
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:18,510
Oh, what the...

1652
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:22,310
It's literally you!

1653
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:29,530
Yeah, we all do.

1654
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:33,490
We all know.

1655
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:45,310
What's this?

1656
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:47,010
Oh, upstairs bathroom key.

1657
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:47,630
Dang it.

1658
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:48,890
Three cakes?

1659
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:49,630
Wait, where's another cake?

1660
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:52,970
Get the head.

1661
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:54,770
Where is it?

1662
01:14:55,670 --> 01:14:56,170
Where's the cake?

1663
01:14:58,530 --> 01:14:59,310
Where's the cake?

1664
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:01,750
Oh, is there any more cake?

1665
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:02,370
Ok.

1666
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,810
Ok, go get a head.

1667
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:09,390
Oh, I found cake too!

1668
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:12,790
Ok, I'm also gonna go get head.

1669
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:16,330
Oh.

1670
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,800
I'm kinda trapped in my location.

1671
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:32,360
Oh, I think she's on the other side.

1672
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:34,980
Oh my god!

1673
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:39,840
Oh my god!

1674
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,060
Holy...

1675
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:45,880
God!

1676
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,480
I didn't even turn it down!

1677
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:55,180
I saw my flashlight going.

1678
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,120
I should've known.

1679
01:15:58,860 --> 01:15:59,660
You know what?

1680
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:01,140
I know there's an option for like...

1681
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,640
They're like, this is for the not faint of heart.

1682
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:06,700
There's no point in having the jump scare sound on.

1683
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:12,860
Oh, there's a health kit.

1684
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,420
I'll go right next to it.

1685
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,500
The real jump scare going deaf.

1686
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:20,420
That's what I'm saying.

1687
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,600
Oh, there's lots of cake and there's a med kit here.

1688
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,860
Can you guys hear my guy?

1689
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:38,870
Oh gosh.

1690
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,830
Thank goodness I didn't have my headphones on yet.

1691
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,110
I'm so sorry everybody.

1692
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:45,050
I didn't think I was being that loud.

1693
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:45,990
I didn't even turn it down.

1694
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,200
Do you think they'll find me over here?

1695
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,180
There's so much in here.

1696
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,060
There's cake, there's a med kit, there's booze.

1697
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,180
I got all I need.

1698
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,280
A little ear damage as a treat.

1699
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:17,820
Are they even still alive?

1700
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:18,600
I don't hear them.

1701
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:24,960
This is me when I stub my toe.

1702
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:32,150
Oh my god.

1703
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:33,930
The way she screams is crazy.

1704
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:41,410
Where is she?

1705
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:42,930
Are they still alive?

1706
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:43,590
Where are they?

1707
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:47,890
Oh my gosh.

1708
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:48,870
I'm gonna die out here.

1709
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:51,910
I'm gonna die out here like Ryan Reynolds in Blade Runner.

1710
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,080
You'll need to stun her multiple times to calm her down now.

1711
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,520
Just make sure to run when she's stunned.

1712
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:15,720
Got it.

1713
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:18,200
Hello?

1714
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:27,820
I know where the med kit is.

1715
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:32,880
Oh, I said Ryan Reynolds.

1716
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:37,900
Wrong Ryan.

1717
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,880
Wait, there's a med kit in here.

1718
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:47,660
It's right here.

1719
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,160
It's right here.

1720
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,060
And there's lots of cake and stuff in here too.

1721
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,640
There you go.

1722
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:52,120
Got you.

1723
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,920
Someone in my chat said we'll have to stun her multiple times now to calm her down.

1724
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1725
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,340
And more cake as well.

1726
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,580
Check the bodies for the bathroom key, bro.

1727
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:08,520
How do we open this door?

1728
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,040
Oh, she's right there.

1729
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,780
Oh my god.

1730
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:21,000
Oh my god.

1731
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,680
I don't deserve to be alive.

1732
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,740
I really don't deserve to be alive.

1733
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:25,880
Here, let's go.

1734
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:26,500
We can go through.

1735
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:32,620
Let's see.

1736
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:35,260
Any head?

1737
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:38,600
Any head?

1738
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,320
Oh, where are you, Lime?

1739
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:47,160
Oh, hi Stumpy.

1740
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:52,560
We're trying to find heads, I guess.

1741
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,080
Oh yeah, me too.

1742
01:19:58,880 --> 01:19:59,980
These things suck.

1743
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:05,160
I think they're all trapped behind that one...

1744
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,000
baby.

1745
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,880
You're so cute being sad about something.

1746
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:17,340
What's she being so sad about?

1747
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,440
More cake in here.

1748
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:25,980
What if the last key is like gated behind actually like burying the bodies or something?

1749
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:27,780
It could be.

1750
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:29,880
I hope not.

1751
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,680
Unless we just had the bathroom key and nobody knew.

1752
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,720
Yeah, did everyone try opening it?

1753
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:38,620
I've tried opening it.

1754
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:39,400
Yeah, me too.

1755
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:47,200
This is an actual mirror?

1756
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:47,940
Wow, crazy.

1757
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:51,360
Wait, I thought it was one too.

1758
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,200
I was like, oh, our escape route.

1759
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:01,180
I can't stop thinking...

1760
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:01,780
Oh god.

1761
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,020
Oh god.

1762
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:06,560
No.

1763
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:13,280
I think she's still in the real world.

1764
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,020
Oh my god.

1765
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:15,840
Oh, here she comes!

1766
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:16,740
Stun her, stun her!

1767
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,040
Ok, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1768
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:25,300
Just run.

1769
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,180
Just run.

1770
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:34,780
Yeah, yeah.

1771
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,280
I think she's gonna come out.

1772
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:37,300
We're gonna have to...

1773
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:40,580
She's where?

1774
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,080
Where is she?

1775
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,060
Come here!

1776
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:49,540
Oh.

1777
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,440
No, we couldn't find any.

1778
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,120
I think she's stupid.

1779
01:21:59,320 --> 01:21:59,960
Oh, there she is.

1780
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:02,820
Double kill.

1781
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,020
Oh, we got her, we got her, we got her, we got her.

1782
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:11,220
Yeah.

1783
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:11,420
Yeah.

1784
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:19,220
No, I think it's true though, because once we started burying things, we got more heads, so...

1785
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:24,520
I'm buried though.

1786
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,940
I got a lady.

1787
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:32,620
Ok, where's Snuffy?

1788
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:33,880
Where is Snuffy?

1789
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,060
Wait, I'm gonna get the flower lady.

1790
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:39,560
Actually, no.

1791
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:40,680
I know where the flower lady goes.

1792
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:41,080
I'll get this one.

1793
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:46,620
I don't know where this lady goes, but I'll figure it out, because...

1794
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:49,300
Snuffy!

1795
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,400
Wait, do you... Wait, Doki, do you know where...

1796
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:55,200
Oh, ok.

1797
01:22:59,340 --> 01:22:59,700
Snuffy?

1798
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:03,700
Oh, there's Snuffy.

1799
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:04,020
Ok.

1800
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,480
Oh, I found mine!

1801
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:11,520
Oh, mine's right here!

1802
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:12,180
Mine's right here!

1803
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:12,860
Snuffy!

1804
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:13,560
Snuffy!

1805
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,600
I've got one too.

1806
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,180
I've got one too once you're done.

1807
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,880
Ok, so... Snuffy, this way?

1808
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,180
This way?

1809
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:31,480
This way?

1810
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:34,300
What is it?

1811
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:35,980
Oh, it's a key!

1812
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,740
There's a lady right here that needs to be buried!

1813
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:54,920
Right there!

1814
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:55,260
Right there!

1815
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,280
We'll protect you!

1816
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:06,040
Oh, she... Ah, it's at the head!

1817
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:06,720
Oh, watch out!

1818
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:14,280
I don't think we're gaming.

1819
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,540
I got one!

1820
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:20,940
I got one!

1821
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:23,820
Ouch!

1822
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:24,300
Ouch!

1823
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:24,900
Ouch!

1824
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:28,100
Oh, wait, where is it?

1825
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,020
Ok, I'll do it.

1826
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,720
Um, we gotta save.

1827
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,840
Yeah, cause she killed Doggie.

1828
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:42,120
Yeah...

1829
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:43,360
Where's the bird?

1830
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:45,660
Ow!

1831
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:46,420
Oh my god.

1832
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:47,120
I hear him.

1833
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,740
Yeah, get his ass.

1834
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,040
Ok.

1835
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:02,620
Uh, how do I... How do I dig?

1836
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,020
Oh my god!

1837
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:12,940
I got it?

1838
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:13,920
Ok, you try digging.

1839
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:15,480
Ok.

1840
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,760
Oh, it's on the dirt pile.

1841
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:17,120
That's why.

1842
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:17,600
Ok, ok.

1843
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:19,280
I'm silly.

1844
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:19,800
Sorry.

1845
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:24,420
Nice.

1846
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,060
Oh, we're halfway there!

1847
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:31,440
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

1848
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:33,160
Wherever front is.

1849
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:34,380
Ah, shit.

1850
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,420
Oh, welcome back!

1851
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:43,160
It's this way!

1852
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:43,560
It's this way!

1853
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:43,940
It's this way!

1854
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:48,600
Oh, ouch!

1855
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,120
I know.

1856
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:58,920
Oh, I have a battery.

1857
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:00,100
There's a battery right here.

1858
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:00,780
You can use it.

1859
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:01,500
Run!

1860
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:01,780
Run!

1861
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:02,100
Run!

1862
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:02,800
Run away from her!

1863
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:03,660
Run away from her!

1864
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:04,820
Oh god.

1865
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,560
Did she... Did she just... Oh.

1866
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,340
Oh my god, and the bird.

1867
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,000
Ok.

1868
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,540
Uh, does anyone have the shovel?

1869
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,200
Ok, there we go.

1870
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:33,300
Ok, I got a medkit, so I guess I'll go... I'll go save Stuffy.

1871
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,200
Who's laughing?

1872
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:43,420
Oh, I know.

1873
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,320
That's my character celebrating because she's a freak.

1874
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,000
Oh.

1875
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:48,300
Oh god.

1876
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:49,660
Oh god.

1877
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:52,580
If I die, I have a medkit.

1878
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:54,480
Just take it if I die.

1879
01:26:59,270 --> 01:26:59,790
Ok.

1880
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:01,350
Time to go save Snuffy.

1881
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:02,250
Oh, there's Snuffy.

1882
01:27:05,610 --> 01:27:06,830
There's my son.

1883
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:08,870
I got you, son!

1884
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:09,750
Son!

1885
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:11,830
I got you, son!

1886
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:13,750
Oh, son!

1887
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:14,510
Son!

1888
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:15,950
Son, I don't got you, son.

1889
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:16,670
Son.

1890
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:18,250
Son.

1891
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:19,270
Son, I'm sorry, son.

1892
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:21,730
Son, I'm sorry, son.

1893
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:22,830
Son, I'm sorry, son.

1894
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:23,930
Son, I'm sorry!

1895
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:27,470
Hello.

1896
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:34,110
I might have left... led her there to here.

1897
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:34,910
I don't know.

1898
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:37,410
Oh, son!

1899
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:46,030
I got you, son.

1900
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:50,730
We probably should have waited until she was not aggroed anymore.

1901
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:54,050
No way!

1902
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:05,150
I'm so proud of you.

1903
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:27,480
Literally, as I was saying...

1904
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,080
Oh my god.

1905
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:35,960
She's crawling again.

1906
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:39,120
I have this.

1907
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,080
Do we want to go bury it?

1908
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:45,320
Ok.

1909
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:50,720
Ok.

1910
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:51,100
Ok.

1911
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,060
I'll grab a cake.

1912
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:53,960
Is that her?

1913
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:55,180
Oh no, that's a bird.

1914
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,420
No, she's not.

1915
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:02,640
Oh god!

1916
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:05,500
Ok.

1917
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:06,000
Ride!

1918
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:06,340
Ride!

1919
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:06,580
Ride!

1920
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:06,900
Ride!

1921
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:11,300
I'm running!

1922
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:11,760
I'm running!

1923
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:12,220
I'm running!

1924
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:12,680
I'm running!

1925
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:19,700
Go to the other world!

1926
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:22,460
Oh shit!

1927
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:23,700
Oh no!

1928
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:24,740
No!

1929
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,120
I think I'm next, guys.

1930
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:38,320
I can't tell if she's aggroed anymore or not.

1931
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:47,680
I have no more battery.

1932
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:50,640
I think I'm...

1933
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,160
I haven't found anymore...

1934
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,840
I ate that pasta for breakfast.

1935
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:10,120
She's immediately coming.

1936
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,420
She's in this world, right?

1937
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:15,660
Absolutely.

1938
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,380
I always get stuck behind the door.

1939
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:24,320
I still don't see any heads in the other world.

1940
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:25,120
Me neither.

1941
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:28,840
Oh!

1942
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,480
Oh no!

1943
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:33,660
Not alive!

1944
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:36,080
I'm stuck on the door!

1945
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:37,040
Doki?

1946
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,300
I think...I don't think we are going to get this.

1947
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:52,100
Are you ok?

1948
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,020
This is bullshit.

1949
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,460
Welcome to devour experience.

1950
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,700
I don't see any heads.

1951
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,920
That was just a bunch of this all over the place.

1952
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:12,180
I found a head!

1953
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:12,860
I found a head!

1954
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,080
What are you talking about?

1955
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,640
I was literally right in front of it.

1956
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:21,560
You know what?

1957
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:24,940
I'm going to die so that you have to do everything by yourself.

1958
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:29,640
She's coming.

1959
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:30,100
She's coming.

1960
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:30,540
She's coming.

1961
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,260
Oh, this is not a real mirror.

1962
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:42,060
Doki, you died on purpose, didn't you?

1963
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:42,160
No!

1964
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:48,980
You died on...oh.

1965
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,420
I'm colliding with the ghost.

1966
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:54,340
I can't get inside.

1967
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:56,700
I'm colliding with the ghost.

1968
01:31:58,180 --> 01:31:59,560
She's my wife!

1969
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:03,220
There is no way.

1970
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,620
There is no way I can do all of this by myself.

1971
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,540
It's literally impossible.

1972
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:09,660
It's literally impossible!

1973
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:13,600
It's literally impossible!

1974
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,200
Everybody is dead?

1975
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:19,800
Oh god, everybody is converging here.

1976
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:26,560
I'll join you here!

1977
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:27,780
I'll join you here!

1978
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:32,080
OK, block her!

1979
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:32,500
Block her!

1980
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,240
Body block her!

1981
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,380
Body...oh shit!

1982
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:55,880
Oh my god, we got an achievement left for dead.

1983
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:56,940
Lost a game.

1984
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,840
Love that that's an achievement when it's like the default for this game.

1985
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:07,200
We were getting devoured.

1986
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:14,710
Guys, we kind of got bodied.

1987
01:33:17,210 --> 01:33:19,030
Oh my god.

1988
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:21,350
Oh my god.

1989
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:22,570
I'm so sorry.

1990
01:33:26,150 --> 01:33:28,010
We didn't survive.

1991
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:38,170
It's OK, guys.

1992
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:41,210
She's spawn camping me.

1993
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:44,250
OK, I'm gonna turn off player collision.

1994
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:49,650
I'm turning off batteries and I'm turning off medkits.

1995
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:55,270
Well, no, I think turning off batteries is bad because our flashlight is still refilled.

1996
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:59,630
But the batteries added more to it, so turning off batteries would be worse.

1997
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:00,950
Yeah, maybe?

1998
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:04,810
Would medkit mean we don't have any meds at all?

1999
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:06,890
Yeah, no, you want to keep those on.

2000
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:09,110
OK, so everything is the same.

2001
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:11,390
Alright, we can make it easier, by the way.

2002
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:11,970
Oh, survive?

2003
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:12,410
OK.

2004
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:15,310
OK, well, I think I get it, right?

2005
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:16,750
I think I get the hang of it now.

2006
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:18,310
You got it, right?

2007
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:21,090
Yeah, we have the system now.

2008
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:21,810
We know what to do.

2009
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:23,350
Yeah, we figured it out.

2010
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:26,170
It just took a long time.

2011
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:30,650
It just took multiple medkits.

2012
01:34:31,950 --> 01:34:32,850
Oh my gosh.

2013
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:34,650
Two of those were mine.

2014
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:35,390
I'm so sorry.

2015
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:41,050
Because of the damn tentacles.

2016
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:42,150
Two of them were me.

2017
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:45,530
How's that?

2018
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:50,130
I know this is way late, guys, but how is the audio?

2019
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:54,030
I feel like I'm too loud, but Doki said I needed to be louder.

2020
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:01,390
It's good.

2021
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:10,710
Yeah, Doki does have some kind of noise gate.

2022
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:11,130
I don't know.

2023
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:12,690
It's kind of funny, though.

2024
01:35:14,530 --> 01:35:16,310
Oh, hello?

2025
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:17,350
Hello?

2026
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:24,330
Moshi moshi!

2027
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:33,210
Oh, I'm alive.

2028
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:38,430
No way!

2029
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:39,590
Moshi moshi!

2030
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:43,850
I like to be immersed.

2031
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:45,410
I like to sympathize with the ghost.

2032
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:48,310
What are you talking about?

2033
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:48,730
Come on!

2034
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:53,090
I know this has been leaking, but can you use the volume okay, guys?

2035
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:59,730
Oh, yeah, your audio is all fucked, Doki.

2036
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:00,730
That's why I'm asking.

2037
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:03,450
If it's bothering you, you can turn the jumpscares off.

2038
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:06,230
Yeah, it's really loud.

2039
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:08,450
Don't feel bad about it.

2040
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:19,930
Let's get ready to do the fastest fucking run of our lives.

2041
01:36:21,670 --> 01:36:23,650
We gotta make sure we grab all the keys, though.

2042
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:26,450
Wasn't there... This one spawned here.

2043
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:27,510
It wasn't here originally.

2044
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:30,590
Oh, maybe it's different.

2045
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:34,390
Maybe it spawns more when we grab more keys.

2046
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:39,010
Oh wait, are you serious?

2047
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:40,630
Oh my god, you're right.

2048
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:42,090
They have different spots.

2049
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:42,590
No!

2050
01:36:44,310 --> 01:36:44,890
The people?

2051
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:46,250
The bodies?

2052
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:47,130
Yeah.

2053
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:50,310
This is a speedrunner's worst nightmare.

2054
01:36:50,490 --> 01:36:51,410
Why would they do this?

2055
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:55,030
Speedrun a haunting.

2056
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:01,910
This was the redhead.

2057
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:04,830
Oh wait, was it the redhead?

2058
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:05,310
I think so.

2059
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:06,730
This is how we get in over here, though.

2060
01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:17,830
Lime is so fast.

2061
01:37:20,370 --> 01:37:21,070
No, you're good.

2062
01:37:21,070 --> 01:37:21,090
You're good.

2063
01:37:23,830 --> 01:37:28,530
Oh, you can't kill the crows yet.

2064
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:34,590
What door?

2065
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:35,350
What'd I open?

2066
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:36,570
Oh yeah.

2067
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:41,030
Yeah, then I'll do it again.

2068
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:47,930
Wait, let's grab cake first, right?

2069
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:50,510
Let's find some cake first.

2070
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:57,250
Yeah, that seems... I think so too.

2071
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:01,670
Here we go!

2072
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:04,550
Oh, watch out.

2073
01:38:04,690 --> 01:38:05,390
Don't... Oh no!

2074
01:38:05,650 --> 01:38:06,290
Oh my god.

2075
01:38:07,390 --> 01:38:07,750
See?

2076
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:09,370
It's so easy to step in it.

2077
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:14,490
Upstairs?

2078
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:17,490
I think it was upstairs.

2079
01:38:18,110 --> 01:38:19,090
Maybe I'm crazy.

2080
01:38:22,190 --> 01:38:24,110
I feel like...

2081
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:26,710
Oh yeah, yeah.

2082
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:27,230
It was this one.

2083
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:27,870
It was this one.

2084
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:35,450
Alright, daughter.

2085
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:41,010
What?

2086
01:38:44,730 --> 01:38:46,430
It's time to be a woman.

2087
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:51,210
Oh, that's what it feels like.

2088
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:52,510
Yeah, I get jump scared.

2089
01:38:52,610 --> 01:38:54,070
You guys just have the lights turned on.

2090
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:58,870
We gotta get keys now.

2091
01:38:59,010 --> 01:38:59,870
We gotta get keys.

2092
01:39:00,130 --> 01:39:01,070
Keys and heads.

2093
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:02,050
Keys and heads.

2094
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:03,830
The strats.

2095
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:04,890
Keys and heads.

2096
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:09,570
Maybe the key will... Maybe the key is spawned outside.

2097
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:12,210
Because we opened the doors.

2098
01:39:13,090 --> 01:39:14,050
Painting room key.

2099
01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:14,770
Ok.

2100
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:17,850
Where is she?

2101
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:25,890
Maybe everybody is not in this world.

2102
01:39:28,490 --> 01:39:30,030
I can't... Oh, she is in this world.

2103
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:30,510
Nevermind.

2104
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:30,910
Just kidding.

2105
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:31,550
I'm leaving.

2106
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,680
Oh, I just found the painting room.

2107
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:40,120
Wait, I know where the painting room is.

2108
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:41,880
I'm in the painting room right now.

2109
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:42,620
You were in there?

2110
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,220
No, I was just over there.

2111
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,260
Oh gosh.

2112
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:47,680
How do I get back?

2113
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,820
Can you open the painting room though?

2114
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:51,240
I know.

2115
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,200
I saw it.

2116
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:53,460
I was literally just there.

2117
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:55,760
How do we get there?

2118
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,420
I don't remember.

2119
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:57,540
It was through here.

2120
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:04,860
It was... It was...

2121
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,380
It's like back here, right?

2122
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:07,240
Here, here, here.

2123
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:07,780
Here, here, here.

2124
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:08,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2125
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:11,500
Little head.

2126
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:12,780
Oh, head, head, head!

2127
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:13,920
Come, come, come, come.

2128
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:15,460
I'm grabbing him.

2129
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,460
Come on, little guy.

2130
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:18,820
Come on, little guy.

2131
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:22,300
Oh, you got him.

2132
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:22,580
Nice.

2133
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:24,680
What was that?

2134
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:25,420
Oh, thank you.

2135
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:29,820
The cake can be used multiple times.

2136
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:34,240
Yeah.

2137
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:35,700
No.

2138
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:40,080
He doesn't need it.

2139
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:41,360
He's a skinny guy.

2140
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:42,120
Skinny legend.

2141
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:44,600
Excuse me.

2142
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:45,000
Sorry.

2143
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:45,840
Excuse me.

2144
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:46,060
Sorry.

2145
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:46,660
Sorry.

2146
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,640
We're both very wide bodied.

2147
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:54,360
Any skinnies?

2148
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,080
Any skinnies in here?

2149
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,280
Little guys?

2150
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:02,220
Wait, this is the painting room.

2151
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,700
Any skinny guys?

2152
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:06,780
Yeah, we're big boned.

2153
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:12,070
Any skinnies?

2154
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:16,570
I think I hear her children.

2155
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:20,530
More cake.

2156
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:21,450
What's in here?

2157
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,770
Oh, I don't think I've ever even been in here before.

2158
01:41:24,050 --> 01:41:24,470
What's this?

2159
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:26,190
Oh, children.

2160
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:29,550
Wait a second.

2161
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:30,830
Oh my god.

2162
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:33,770
Oh, I'm in here.

2163
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:36,010
Wait, where am I?

2164
01:41:36,850 --> 01:41:38,870
Guys, I'm so lost.

2165
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:40,910
Friends and the family.

2166
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:42,690
The bones.

2167
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:47,870
I'm gonna go down and out to that one room.

2168
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:48,850
Or out here.

2169
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:51,850
By the fountain, because there was a key over here.

2170
01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:54,890
I wonder if it respawned, you know?

2171
01:41:56,150 --> 01:41:57,130
Broad shoulder...

2172
01:41:57,130 --> 01:42:00,330
I got the closet.

2173
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:01,770
That's nice.

2174
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:05,830
Am I Australian?

2175
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:07,170
Crikey.

2176
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:15,400
This isn't the closet, is it?

2177
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:19,910
More cake.

2178
01:42:21,650 --> 01:42:23,090
There's gotta be a head in here.

2179
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:27,090
Nothing.

2180
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:28,550
Where did everybody go?

2181
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:30,670
How am I so by myself?

2182
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:32,590
I'm scared.

2183
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:35,210
What?

2184
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:41,030
Hi.

2185
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:45,910
Yeah, me too.

2186
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:48,310
But I couldn't find anybody.

2187
01:42:48,990 --> 01:42:51,870
I just opened these doors and there was nothing in here.

2188
01:42:54,690 --> 01:42:56,050
Anyone in here?

2189
01:42:57,730 --> 01:42:58,750
Rubber ducky?

2190
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:01,890
Dingo, wipe me baby.

2191
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:06,230
Dingo, wipe your baby.

2192
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:08,830
I never seen that movie.

2193
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:13,050
There's a closet right here.

2194
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:14,250
Where's the closet key?

2195
01:43:15,150 --> 01:43:16,510
Somebody has it, I remember.

2196
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:19,830
I got a cake.

2197
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:28,270
You grabbed my last guy, so I...What the hell?

2198
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:32,470
No!

2199
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:37,430
I just want one head, please!

2200
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:43,570
Just want one head.

2201
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:48,470
Is there any head in here?

2202
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:56,240
Oh wait, there used to be.

2203
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:57,300
Wasn't there a mirror there?

2204
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:59,440
The mirror locations changed too?

2205
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,560
You guys, I have no head.

2206
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:03,520
No from Seinfeld.

2207
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,460
I thought it was a movie.

2208
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,280
Someone pick an alcohol for me.

2209
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:12,720
Alcohol?

2210
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:17,740
Ok, I got it.

2211
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:18,740
Oh, watch out, watch out.

2212
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:24,000
Get the birds.

2213
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:27,320
Alright.

2214
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:32,440
I don't believe that anyone has beaten this game before.

2215
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:36,840
Until now.

2216
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:41,580
We will be the first VTubers who beat this game.

2217
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,920
We'll be the first anybody to beat this game if we can.

2218
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,940
Ok, I'm here waterboarding the head now.

2219
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:48,820
I know.

2220
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,820
Why do we put it face down like this?

2221
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:53,880
Oh my god!

2222
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:56,400
There's a little baby head!

2223
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:59,180
Yeah, it's the ring boy.

2224
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:03,680
I feel like this looks like...You know how in Minecraft you can arrange people's heads?

2225
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,720
Wait, he just grabbed one!

2226
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:10,280
That's fine, it's just one guy.

2227
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,900
Yeah, but they'll keep grabbing them.

2228
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:15,600
Yeah, but they're super calm for now.

2229
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:17,600
The more heads we bury, the...

2230
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:18,680
Yeah, the more aggro.

2231
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,760
Yeah, the more crazy they get.

2232
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:24,000
Alright, we just need to find another...

2233
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,720
Do you think we'll be able to find more heads or is that it for now?

2234
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:28,120
I don't know.

2235
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:31,560
We need to find the place to bury the shovel first.

2236
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:33,100
Wasn't it in the backyard?

2237
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,140
It was this way, outside this way.

2238
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:39,920
And we should be able to have a shovel like...

2239
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:40,920
Around here?

2240
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:41,780
Yeah, here.

2241
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:45,360
We'll find more alcohol just in case.

2242
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:46,180
Oh, there's a shovel!

2243
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:46,800
I found a shovel!

2244
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:47,860
What's this?

2245
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:48,920
Oh, this is the priest.

2246
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:50,340
Priest.

2247
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,720
A little bit of priest.

2248
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:54,760
Oh, I'm stuck?

2249
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:58,720
That's nice, Sweeney Todd.

2250
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,060
Yeah, thanks.

2251
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,040
Theater nerd.

2252
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:05,920
There it is.

2253
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:07,040
Okay, that's the chef.

2254
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:09,520
Now I know where the chef is.

2255
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:10,920
Oh, that's candles.

2256
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:13,240
More medkit.

2257
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:15,440
There's a maid.

2258
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,320
I found a maid!

2259
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:18,440
Oh, there's a key!

2260
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:19,480
Nice!

2261
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:21,040
Children's bedroom!

2262
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:23,740
Just in time, just in case.

2263
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:24,920
Yeah.

2264
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,060
I got cake, I got cake.

2265
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:29,620
The children's bedroom has two doors.

2266
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,820
So make sure you get both of them.

2267
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:33,120
What are you looking at?

2268
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:33,920
Yes, you.

2269
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:37,720
It's literally you.

2270
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:39,180
That's literally you.

2271
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:40,920
Yeah, but there can only be one.

2272
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,580
Okay, I got this.

2273
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:44,680
Okay, nice.

2274
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:45,900
Where's the other children's bedroom?

2275
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:46,880
Right here, right here.

2276
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:48,960
Oh, there it is.

2277
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,200
It allows a loop.

2278
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:50,300
A loop.

2279
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:53,480
I have cake.

2280
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:58,480
Where?

2281
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,020
Oh, I got him.

2282
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:03,980
Please.

2283
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:04,740
No!

2284
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:07,420
Why?

2285
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:08,240
How do you...

2286
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:09,040
How do you...

2287
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:11,100
This is a ping diff, I swear.

2288
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:14,180
How are you...

2289
01:47:14,180 --> 01:47:14,960
How?

2290
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:15,060
No!

2291
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:20,360
Oh, I already had Alpha.

2292
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,460
He's got that host latency advantage.

2293
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:24,180
I know, seriously.

2294
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:38,330
I just want one head.

2295
01:47:41,490 --> 01:47:42,950
Everybody's here for the ritual.

2296
01:47:52,270 --> 01:47:53,570
I got an old man.

2297
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:55,070
Oh, I got the priest, I got the priest.

2298
01:47:55,530 --> 01:47:55,610
Nice.

2299
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:58,930
Yeah, yeah, he's new.

2300
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:01,270
Do you think we...

2301
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:03,010
We can find more heads or is that it?

2302
01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:04,890
I think that's it.

2303
01:48:04,930 --> 01:48:07,570
There's one door that we haven't unlocked, the child's bedroom.

2304
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:08,590
Oh, we've got that one.

2305
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:11,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2306
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:13,190
I feel like...

2307
01:48:13,190 --> 01:48:15,410
Oh my god, your cake is so extra moldy.

2308
01:48:15,710 --> 01:48:18,750
I feel like we should find more alcohol and put it down here then, just in case.

2309
01:48:18,890 --> 01:48:20,790
I remember seeing one...

2310
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:22,390
I can go grab it.

2311
01:48:23,390 --> 01:48:25,030
I'm gonna go grab it.

2312
01:48:27,730 --> 01:48:28,610
Lime!

2313
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:32,810
Oh no.

2314
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:35,070
She's really eepy.

2315
01:48:36,970 --> 01:48:38,990
It was like...

2316
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:39,790
This way.

2317
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:41,030
I remember seeing it.

2318
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:45,170
Around here.

2319
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:46,670
There.

2320
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:51,030
Oh.

2321
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:53,450
Wait, we haven't gone through here?

2322
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:54,790
Oh, yes we have.

2323
01:48:55,390 --> 01:48:56,250
This is the circle.

2324
01:48:58,530 --> 01:48:59,750
I got more alcohol!

2325
01:49:02,350 --> 01:49:03,570
I got more alcohol.

2326
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:05,670
Nice.

2327
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:07,730
Good job, Mint.

2328
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:08,810
Thanks, Mint.

2329
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:12,590
Chai, thank you for the gift.

2330
01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:14,430
Oh my goodness, now I'm tired.

2331
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:15,810
Thank you for the super chat.

2332
01:49:16,190 --> 01:49:17,090
I have alcohol here.

2333
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:17,510
Yeah.

2334
01:49:19,330 --> 01:49:21,090
Alright, I mean we have three, that should be...

2335
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:23,650
Should be good.

2336
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:27,470
Wait, we have one, two, three, four, five...

2337
01:49:27,470 --> 01:49:29,510
We need two more, I guess?

2338
01:49:31,090 --> 01:49:31,750
I guess, yeah.

2339
01:49:32,470 --> 01:49:33,990
I think that's fine, right?

2340
01:49:34,150 --> 01:49:37,530
Oh wait, then there's also... this one's filled, so...

2341
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:39,070
Yeah, I think we just need one more.

2342
01:49:39,170 --> 01:49:40,010
We just need one more, yeah.

2343
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:41,110
Oh my god.

2344
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:42,790
Oh my god.

2345
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:46,790
Oh my god.

2346
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:49,610
This is the strat.

2347
01:49:50,630 --> 01:49:51,590
Oh, there's one right here.

2348
01:49:51,850 --> 01:49:52,890
Oh, wow.

2349
01:49:55,550 --> 01:49:57,630
We got all the alcohol.

2350
01:50:05,570 --> 01:50:08,650
The wedding is back on.

2351
01:50:11,010 --> 01:50:11,550
Oh, okay.

2352
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:15,890
Asleep.

2353
01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:23,490
The crows will take them, yeah.

2354
01:50:25,970 --> 01:50:28,270
But there will be as soon as we put on a couple.

2355
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:31,810
I feel like we should just put them on now.

2356
01:50:32,370 --> 01:50:36,630
I feel we should get the other shovel and then one person puts it on and the other person...

2357
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:37,410
Like, we go in pairs.

2358
01:50:38,690 --> 01:50:38,910
Okay.

2359
01:50:41,030 --> 01:50:42,950
I don't know, I think there's only one shovel.

2360
01:50:42,950 --> 01:50:44,690
Oh, there's a cake upstairs that I put up there.

2361
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:45,030
Hold on.

2362
01:50:45,470 --> 01:50:46,610
We're ready!

2363
01:50:47,490 --> 01:50:50,150
We're ready to put some...

2364
01:50:50,150 --> 01:50:51,290
Get a grab a head.

2365
01:50:51,950 --> 01:50:52,430
Mine's a priest.

2366
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:55,390
Mine's the redhead lady.

2367
01:50:56,450 --> 01:50:58,070
Mine's a gigachat, I guess.

2368
01:50:58,530 --> 01:51:00,690
Let's find yours first then, maybe.

2369
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:01,850
Since we don't know what he's like.

2370
01:51:02,170 --> 01:51:04,170
He's got, like, facial hair.

2371
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:05,990
Is that the groom?

2372
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:08,390
It looks totally different, yeah.

2373
01:51:09,090 --> 01:51:10,210
Alright, let's figure it out.

2374
01:51:10,690 --> 01:51:11,170
Yeah.

2375
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:13,070
Oh my god.

2376
01:51:13,630 --> 01:51:14,290
Guess who?

2377
01:51:19,030 --> 01:51:20,290
Is he middle-aged?

2378
01:51:20,430 --> 01:51:21,750
Do you have facial hair?

2379
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:24,290
Buzzcut...

2380
01:51:24,290 --> 01:51:25,970
Or buzz... sides.

2381
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:28,410
Okay, that's a lady.

2382
01:51:28,650 --> 01:51:29,670
That's a lady over there.

2383
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:31,590
Oh no, that's a little boy.

2384
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:34,650
If someone still has the ring bearer, that would be them.

2385
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:37,110
Is there bodies here?

2386
01:51:37,670 --> 01:51:39,090
It might be this guy here.

2387
01:51:39,250 --> 01:51:39,910
Oh, try it.

2388
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:40,810
Yeah, try it.

2389
01:51:41,550 --> 01:51:43,090
This head does not belong here.

2390
01:51:43,110 --> 01:51:44,410
Oh my god.

2391
01:51:44,850 --> 01:51:46,830
Honestly, it don't matter.

2392
01:51:47,690 --> 01:51:49,430
It doesn't matter.

2393
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:49,770
I know.

2394
01:51:50,210 --> 01:51:52,430
I think it's at the other side.

2395
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:54,530
It's the other side.

2396
01:51:54,710 --> 01:51:55,910
This is my lady though.

2397
01:51:57,230 --> 01:51:58,070
I have her.

2398
01:51:59,070 --> 01:52:00,070
Should I bury her?

2399
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:02,290
No, I'll grab her back.

2400
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:02,750
It's fine.

2401
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:03,430
Don't worry about it.

2402
01:52:03,470 --> 01:52:04,350
We'll get her later.

2403
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:06,630
Well, let's find Limes first.

2404
01:52:07,570 --> 01:52:08,870
I like that you can just take it back.

2405
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:09,930
Actually, I changed my mind.

2406
01:52:10,650 --> 01:52:11,470
You can't have that.

2407
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:15,050
I've grown attached to her, honestly.

2408
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,110
Oh, who's here?

2409
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:19,530
Oh, that's the chef.

2410
01:52:20,290 --> 01:52:21,850
So, it's a wedding.

2411
01:52:21,950 --> 01:52:23,490
We have to find the...

2412
01:52:23,490 --> 01:52:24,710
It has to be the wedding area.

2413
01:52:25,310 --> 01:52:27,190
I have no idea who this fucking guy is.

2414
01:52:27,210 --> 01:52:28,370
He's not the priest?

2415
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:29,250
Is it this guy?

2416
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:31,290
Oh, maybe this guy.

2417
01:52:31,290 --> 01:52:32,250
What is this?

2418
01:52:32,610 --> 01:52:34,130
Oh Jesus!

2419
01:52:35,150 --> 01:52:35,890
What is that?

2420
01:52:37,470 --> 01:52:39,250
What is your job?

2421
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:39,930
What is your duty?

2422
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:41,830
It might be a gardener.

2423
01:52:41,890 --> 01:52:44,670
Oh, it's a gardener.

2424
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:45,890
Yeah, it's this guy.

2425
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:47,610
No, it's this guy here.

2426
01:52:47,730 --> 01:52:49,850
No, it's this guy here.

2427
01:52:50,310 --> 01:52:52,390
It's literally this guy right here.

2428
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:53,530
It's this guy.

2429
01:52:54,910 --> 01:52:56,210
Yeah, it's this guy.

2430
01:52:57,510 --> 01:52:58,030
Go!

2431
01:52:58,330 --> 01:52:58,670
Go!

2432
01:52:58,710 --> 01:52:58,970
Go!

2433
01:52:58,970 --> 01:52:59,270
Berry!

2434
01:52:59,430 --> 01:52:59,590
Berry!

2435
01:52:59,770 --> 01:52:59,990
Berry!

2436
01:53:02,650 --> 01:53:04,950
This is what you've been training for, boy.

2437
01:53:05,690 --> 01:53:06,270
This is it.

2438
01:53:06,450 --> 01:53:07,490
I'm so proud of you.

2439
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:11,210
Priest!

2440
01:53:18,070 --> 01:53:18,550
Priest!

2441
01:53:18,690 --> 01:53:18,870
Priest!

2442
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:22,590
We can stun her though.

2443
01:53:22,630 --> 01:53:23,370
We can stun her.

2444
01:53:23,370 --> 01:53:23,930
Yeah.

2445
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:26,470
Wait!

2446
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:31,110
He just took my head!

2447
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:32,910
Someone just...

2448
01:53:34,150 --> 01:53:34,550
Oh.

2449
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:38,330
Wait, why did I see it all of a sudden then?

2450
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:39,010
That was weird.

2451
01:53:40,510 --> 01:53:41,730
She sounds so close.

2452
01:53:47,110 --> 01:53:47,950
Let's just run through here.

2453
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:52,190
Is she this way?

2454
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:54,050
Right here!

2455
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:54,670
Right here!

2456
01:53:54,670 --> 01:53:54,730
Right here!

2457
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:55,050
Right here!

2458
01:53:57,630 --> 01:53:59,490
Okay, if I see her, I'll get her.

2459
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:02,890
I got my guns blazing.

2460
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:07,050
I'm ready to kick her ass.

2461
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:09,050
Oh, just kidding.

2462
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:13,710
Nice!

2463
01:54:14,770 --> 01:54:16,390
Oh, wait, she's got red eyes, you guys.

2464
01:54:16,470 --> 01:54:17,070
She's got...

2465
01:54:22,990 --> 01:54:23,710
Oh!

2466
01:54:24,150 --> 01:54:25,510
Why is it...

2467
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:27,530
What's going on on my screen?

2468
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:31,710
What just happened?

2469
01:54:32,890 --> 01:54:34,110
What just happened?

2470
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,060
Wait, why did that happen?

2471
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:43,580
Oh, I have allow transparency on.

2472
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,620
That was like my gaming screen, you guys.

2473
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:48,380
That was so funny.

2474
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:48,700
Oh!

2475
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:52,120
There's a head right here!

2476
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:56,860
We gotta get a cake!

2477
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:01,380
So funny.

2478
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:05,780
I'm guarding him.

2479
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:07,300
Yeah.

2480
01:55:13,370 --> 01:55:15,250
Sometimes the door creaks are scary.

2481
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:15,330
Sorry.

2482
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:22,110
She's been pulling you into that the whole time.

2483
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:23,170
No way!

2484
01:55:27,770 --> 01:55:29,170
She's joining the cafe.

2485
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:32,170
Oh, he's right here.

2486
01:55:34,110 --> 01:55:35,750
Here he comes.

2487
01:55:35,970 --> 01:55:36,810
Slow and steady.

2488
01:55:37,090 --> 01:55:39,210
You should do it closer so we can...

2489
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:40,290
So we don't have to wait so long.

2490
01:55:40,410 --> 01:55:41,670
Oh, he's in the ghost world.

2491
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:44,050
What the hell?

2492
01:55:46,230 --> 01:55:47,790
I'm body blocking you.

2493
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:48,930
I'm not letting you through.

2494
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:50,410
Oh, dammit!

2495
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:51,550
No!

2496
01:55:54,810 --> 01:55:55,410
Alright.

2497
01:55:56,290 --> 01:55:58,150
Alright, I'll go wash the head.

2498
01:55:58,490 --> 01:56:00,150
We need to find the other shovel.

2499
01:56:02,170 --> 01:56:03,830
I think it's only one shovel.

2500
01:56:03,830 --> 01:56:04,930
No, there's definitely two.

2501
01:56:06,470 --> 01:56:08,350
Oh my god, is my thing useless?

2502
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:11,330
There's two more.

2503
01:56:11,330 --> 01:56:12,530
I have one as well.

2504
01:56:12,610 --> 01:56:13,870
We all have three.

2505
01:56:15,410 --> 01:56:16,370
Next wave.

2506
01:56:19,530 --> 01:56:21,330
She's faster than you run.

2507
01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:22,870
Than how fast you run.

2508
01:56:23,070 --> 01:56:23,610
It sucks.

2509
01:56:24,810 --> 01:56:26,490
I'm wondering if we're supposed to stun her...

2510
01:56:26,490 --> 01:56:28,270
Then turn our flashlights off and hide or something.

2511
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:29,750
I don't know.

2512
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:31,450
Watch out!

2513
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:35,630
I have...

2514
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:38,970
Did someone take the baby head?

2515
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:40,030
I have the baby head.

2516
01:56:42,810 --> 01:56:44,830
I have the maid.

2517
01:56:44,830 --> 01:56:45,150
I have the baby head.

2518
01:56:50,010 --> 01:56:52,430
Yeah, I have the maid.

2519
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:53,370
You have the chef.

2520
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:54,430
Alright, let's go.

2521
01:56:56,950 --> 01:56:57,990
Uh oh.

2522
01:57:01,270 --> 01:57:03,430
I think we still gotta go though.

2523
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:07,070
Yeah, we gotta go.

2524
01:57:08,970 --> 01:57:11,490
I think she just gets angry, you know?

2525
01:57:11,630 --> 01:57:12,470
Every so often.

2526
01:57:13,070 --> 01:57:15,130
Yeah, she has a little temper tantrum.

2527
01:57:15,730 --> 01:57:17,210
She just gets angry sometimes.

2528
01:57:19,150 --> 01:57:19,810
Oh, ouch!

2529
01:57:20,890 --> 01:57:21,930
Thank you.

2530
01:57:25,150 --> 01:57:26,130
She's out here.

2531
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:28,810
She's out here, I think.

2532
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:29,770
There she is.

2533
01:57:32,810 --> 01:57:33,330
Yeah!

2534
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:34,270
A run!

2535
01:57:34,270 --> 01:57:34,310
Run!

2536
01:57:40,790 --> 01:57:42,550
I think I'm dead again.

2537
01:57:42,730 --> 01:57:43,410
Oh my god.

2538
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:49,610
Oh no!

2539
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:51,530
Wait, I have...

2540
01:57:51,530 --> 01:57:52,830
I have this guy, I think.

2541
01:57:55,010 --> 01:57:55,730
Ok, where's the shovel?

2542
01:57:57,810 --> 01:58:00,010
Oh, I got it.

2543
01:58:01,650 --> 01:58:02,670
Who's laughing?

2544
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:03,430
Oh, it's Stuffy.

2545
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:07,270
Ok.

2546
01:58:08,330 --> 01:58:08,770
Alright.

2547
01:58:11,090 --> 01:58:12,090
Little rat.

2548
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:17,070
Yes!

2549
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:18,750
4 out of 10!

2550
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:26,580
Oh my gosh.

2551
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:28,840
This lady...

2552
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:30,760
You have the maid.

2553
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:31,140
Ok.

2554
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:32,880
Yeah, where's the maid?

2555
01:58:32,980 --> 01:58:33,940
I think it's on...

2556
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:34,860
I haven't seen the maid.

2557
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:36,940
I haven't seen the maid.

2558
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:38,000
Ok.

2559
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:39,440
Just run.

2560
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:44,540
Wait, who's this?

2561
01:58:44,820 --> 01:58:47,180
That's the ring, or the child.

2562
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:49,720
Go!

2563
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:54,080
Go!

2564
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:54,400
Go!

2565
01:58:58,060 --> 01:58:58,540
Ok.

2566
01:58:58,540 --> 01:59:00,060
Protect me!

2567
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:00,900
Protect me!

2568
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:05,580
What the hell?

2569
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:18,640
They did not protect me.

2570
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,600
You need a spade.

2571
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:31,320
Without the jump scare sound, it's so funny even.

2572
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:35,320
Oh my god, she's so aggroed.

2573
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,240
Maid down!

2574
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:39,620
While we were saving the maid...

2575
01:59:39,620 --> 01:59:41,860
I lost my life for the maid.

2576
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:45,940
She sounds like she's upstairs.

2577
01:59:51,090 --> 01:59:52,230
I'll go check.

2578
01:59:52,870 --> 01:59:53,510
I'll go check.

2579
01:59:53,590 --> 01:59:54,110
I think she's upstairs.

2580
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:59,270
Oh my god.

2581
02:00:05,450 --> 02:00:06,890
The maid was you.

2582
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:10,870
Hey, why are you leaving me?

2583
02:00:11,430 --> 02:00:11,850
Wife!

2584
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:13,430
Wife, please!

2585
02:00:14,810 --> 02:00:15,970
I know you're into...

2586
02:00:16,610 --> 02:00:20,950
I know you're into taller men, but how a short king can treat you well!

2587
02:00:21,630 --> 02:00:22,150
Wife!

2588
02:00:22,410 --> 02:00:23,270
Don't be angry!

2589
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:26,710
I know I lied on my profile, but...

2590
02:00:26,710 --> 02:00:28,350
But it's only a few inches!

2591
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:29,390
Please!

2592
02:00:30,090 --> 02:00:32,330
I know I said I was 6'3"...

2593
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:35,450
But I promise I'll treat you well!

2594
02:00:36,890 --> 02:00:38,710
I'll treat you well!

2595
02:00:39,470 --> 02:00:40,170
Hi!

2596
02:00:43,690 --> 02:00:45,090
Thank you!

2597
02:00:46,710 --> 02:00:49,990
Yeah, get that guy.

2598
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:56,050
Yeah, I'm gonna find a cake and maybe we can get more...

2599
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:56,790
Oh, easy.

2600
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:01,310
Who died so fast?

2601
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:07,300
Head?

2602
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:07,640
Head?

2603
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:10,620
Any head?

2604
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:12,240
Head?

2605
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:14,640
Any head?

2606
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:17,080
Any head?

2607
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:18,440
Doki dead?

2608
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:20,320
Hello!

2609
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:22,960
Yeah, I'm alive.

2610
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:30,180
Wait, there's a head in here?

2611
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:32,920
Where is he?

2612
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:34,320
Oh, I see him.

2613
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:34,940
Drop.

2614
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:38,360
I don't know!

2615
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:44,460
Oh, watch me get this head in front of you.

2616
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:45,420
You can't grab it.

2617
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:50,620
Oh my God!

2618
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:51,360
Somebody's head!

2619
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:58,440
Oh God, I'm so in trouble.

2620
02:01:58,940 --> 02:01:59,880
I think she's coming after me.

2621
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:02,140
I think she's coming after me.

2622
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:07,720
Am I OK down here?

2623
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:10,540
Waterboard!

2624
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:11,020
Waterboard!

2625
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:11,600
Waterboard!

2626
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:12,220
Waterboard!

2627
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:14,640
Am I OK?

2628
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,320
I think that's Doki, right?

2629
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:21,310
I got the flower girl.

2630
02:02:22,990 --> 02:02:24,090
I can't do this.

2631
02:02:24,230 --> 02:02:24,370
Wait.

2632
02:02:27,810 --> 02:02:29,030
Who is coming here?

2633
02:02:29,150 --> 02:02:29,750
Who is this?

2634
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:30,910
Speak!

2635
02:02:31,590 --> 02:02:32,110
Oh, hi.

2636
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:35,950
I got you.

2637
02:02:36,290 --> 02:02:36,550
Alright.

2638
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:38,670
I just got the water girl.

2639
02:02:38,890 --> 02:02:39,610
Water girl?

2640
02:02:40,050 --> 02:02:40,950
The flower girl?

2641
02:02:42,830 --> 02:02:45,850
I saw a bird carrying a head.

2642
02:02:49,470 --> 02:02:51,890
No, we did do the ring boy.

2643
02:02:55,530 --> 02:02:58,750
It was like... I think it was the chef?

2644
02:03:03,510 --> 02:03:05,270
The crow took the chef.

2645
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:07,110
Yeah.

2646
02:03:09,350 --> 02:03:09,990
Fire boy.

2647
02:03:10,610 --> 02:03:11,450
Water girl.

2648
02:03:14,290 --> 02:03:14,930
Right here.

2649
02:03:15,010 --> 02:03:15,190
Right here.

2650
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:19,670
You think we can do it?

2651
02:03:19,870 --> 02:03:20,350
She's... Wait!

2652
02:03:20,450 --> 02:03:20,590
Wait!

2653
02:03:20,650 --> 02:03:21,310
I know where... Oh wait.

2654
02:03:21,370 --> 02:03:21,910
We have to go through.

2655
02:03:22,090 --> 02:03:22,410
OK.

2656
02:03:24,610 --> 02:03:24,810
OK.

2657
02:03:25,030 --> 02:03:25,570
I'm going back.

2658
02:03:25,710 --> 02:03:26,030
I'm going back.

2659
02:03:26,090 --> 02:03:26,510
I'm going back.

2660
02:03:26,610 --> 02:03:26,790
I'm going back.

2661
02:03:30,710 --> 02:03:32,530
But we have no way out.

2662
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:33,150
We gotta go.

2663
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:37,890
OK.

2664
02:03:38,070 --> 02:03:39,130
She chased her.

2665
02:03:39,170 --> 02:03:39,590
Let's go.

2666
02:03:41,570 --> 02:03:42,190
No!

2667
02:03:43,270 --> 02:03:44,250
I'm... Oh.

2668
02:03:47,730 --> 02:03:48,350
OK.

2669
02:03:48,390 --> 02:03:48,690
She's gone.

2670
02:03:53,850 --> 02:03:56,990
I'm a little like... I think she's out here actually.

2671
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:02,930
Oh.

2672
02:04:04,290 --> 02:04:04,890
Right here!

2673
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:05,470
Right here!

2674
02:04:05,470 --> 02:04:05,570
Right here!

2675
02:04:06,450 --> 02:04:06,690
Doki?

2676
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:08,530
Doki?

2677
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:09,590
Oh.

2678
02:04:10,390 --> 02:04:10,810
Oh shit.

2679
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:20,540
Can you get the shovel?

2680
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:21,740
Come here, Snuffy!

2681
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:22,120
Come here!

2682
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:22,820
Hi!

2683
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:25,960
It's inside!

2684
02:04:26,580 --> 02:04:27,440
Can you get this one?

2685
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:30,000
Yeah, it's inside.

2686
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:32,360
I've seen it kind of going around a little bit.

2687
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:33,780
Goodbye, child.

2688
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:35,680
Sweet dreams.

2689
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,040
Little baby.

2690
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:42,600
That's a...

2691
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:47,620
She's right there.

2692
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:48,520
She's...

2693
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:50,840
I'll take... Turn around!

2694
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:57,770
What happened to Doki?

2695
02:04:58,190 --> 02:04:59,190
She's dead.

2696
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:00,850
Oh.

2697
02:05:01,010 --> 02:05:01,770
I grabbed a medkit.

2698
02:05:01,910 --> 02:05:02,570
I can go get her.

2699
02:05:03,730 --> 02:05:04,290
Somehow.

2700
02:05:04,690 --> 02:05:04,850
Oh.

2701
02:05:05,090 --> 02:05:05,090
Oh.

2702
02:05:05,090 --> 02:05:05,450
Sorry.

2703
02:05:08,290 --> 02:05:10,450
Sounds like she doesn't want to be found.

2704
02:05:10,530 --> 02:05:11,310
I don't see her.

2705
02:05:13,610 --> 02:05:14,530
Are you hiding?

2706
02:05:15,990 --> 02:05:16,650
Oh, sorry.

2707
02:05:20,090 --> 02:05:21,490
I'll go in here and I'll hide.

2708
02:05:21,710 --> 02:05:22,190
Good idea.

2709
02:05:28,870 --> 02:05:29,770
What is this?

2710
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:39,040
There's Doki.

2711
02:05:45,810 --> 02:05:46,570
More cake.

2712
02:06:06,390 --> 02:06:07,710
I need to get inside.

2713
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:09,670
Wait, I can help you!

2714
02:06:10,230 --> 02:06:11,610
Whoever is crawling down.

2715
02:06:12,810 --> 02:06:13,570
I can help you.

2716
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:17,090
You found two heads?

2717
02:06:18,230 --> 02:06:19,110
Oh shoot.

2718
02:06:19,570 --> 02:06:20,330
I know where cake is.

2719
02:06:20,350 --> 02:06:21,110
I know where cake is.

2720
02:06:21,330 --> 02:06:22,110
Let me go grab some.

2721
02:06:24,490 --> 02:06:25,290
I'm gonna grab cake.

2722
02:06:26,710 --> 02:06:27,330
Grab the cake.

2723
02:06:27,450 --> 02:06:27,910
Grab the cake.

2724
02:06:30,970 --> 02:06:31,950
I don't know!

2725
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:38,850
She's coming for you.

2726
02:06:39,730 --> 02:06:41,750
She's coming for you.

2727
02:06:42,490 --> 02:06:44,970
She's coming for you.

2728
02:06:47,090 --> 02:06:48,230
I'm gonna shut the door.

2729
02:06:52,990 --> 02:06:54,390
Oh who's here?

2730
02:06:59,060 --> 02:07:00,060
Come on in!

2731
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:00,740
Come on in!

2732
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:01,640
Come on in!

2733
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:06,240
Oh my god.

2734
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:07,700
Maybe it was a mistake.

2735
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:08,660
He's so loud.

2736
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:13,200
Snuffy, where did you die?

2737
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:16,460
It's right by the altar.

2738
02:07:16,820 --> 02:07:18,500
The shovel is right by the altar outside.

2739
02:07:20,220 --> 02:07:21,560
Should we go?

2740
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:24,260
She's not mad anymore.

2741
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:25,220
She's not?

2742
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:27,380
No, she's not screaming.

2743
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:29,580
Oh yeah, you're right.

2744
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:31,920
Where's the shovel?

2745
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:33,160
Ok, I'm trying to find the shovel.

2746
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:34,820
I'm gonna go into the other realm.

2747
02:07:38,060 --> 02:07:43,590
Oh, when did that happen?

2748
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:52,520
In the garden somewhere, she freaked out and beelined straight to me through four rooms in a garden.

2749
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:52,980
What?

2750
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:55,000
Oh, hello.

2751
02:07:56,480 --> 02:07:56,840
Uh oh.

2752
02:07:57,500 --> 02:07:58,000
Oh god.

2753
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:01,420
I heard that there were heads.

2754
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:06,620
I killed the head, I killed the crow, it dropped the head, then three more crows came in and started pecking the shit out of me.

2755
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:07,340
No!

2756
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:09,700
I'll go find a medkit.

2757
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:23,920
Medkit, medkit.

2758
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:26,820
There's gonna be one right here.

2759
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:30,280
There's gonna be one...oh gosh.

2760
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:34,420
Guys, I told you nobody ever defeats this game.

2761
02:08:34,420 --> 02:08:35,720
Oh my god, it's both of them.

2762
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:39,160
No one ever truly beats Devour.

2763
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:42,060
I've never seen anyone beat this game before.

2764
02:08:42,580 --> 02:08:44,380
This game is just way too hard.

2765
02:08:45,620 --> 02:08:46,120
Is that Doki?

2766
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:47,540
Oh my god.

2767
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:53,940
Nobody defeats...nobody beats Devour.

2768
02:08:56,120 --> 02:08:58,020
I got the head though.

2769
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:00,320
I'm gonna go back in here.

2770
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:02,900
I have the shovel!

2771
02:09:03,020 --> 02:09:03,820
Or I have the...

2772
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:15,770
I'm gonna die!

2773
02:09:16,570 --> 02:09:17,430
I'm gonna die.

2774
02:09:17,530 --> 02:09:18,230
I'm gonna die.

2775
02:09:18,550 --> 02:09:19,430
I'm gonna die.

2776
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:21,230
I'm gonna die.

2777
02:09:21,490 --> 02:09:22,370
Goodbye world!

2778
02:09:22,470 --> 02:09:23,110
Goodbye world!

2779
02:09:23,310 --> 02:09:23,990
Oh my god!

2780
02:09:29,210 --> 02:09:31,850
Oh my god, I'm out of...oh my god, there's a medkit.

2781
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:33,810
Oh, I'm the next time.

2782
02:09:33,810 --> 02:09:35,310
Dang it!

2783
02:09:38,170 --> 02:09:39,930
It's up to you Doki!

2784
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:01,300
Streamers don't have time?

2785
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:06,080
I think that comes from someone who has never played Devour before.

2786
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:13,580
I'd rather...OK, you can probably beat it.

2787
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:20,140
It's just the game only wants you to play it in the way that the game wants you to play it.

2788
02:10:22,060 --> 02:10:29,000
The game is like...you can't have any other way of playing it except the way we want you to play it.

2789
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:36,750
Is Doki alive?

2790
02:10:40,230 --> 02:10:45,130
No, I guess so, because three people are down, but we haven't gone back to the lobby yet.

2791
02:10:46,450 --> 02:10:49,010
I'm gonna go...I'm gonna...

2792
02:10:51,070 --> 02:10:52,030
Oh my god.

2793
02:10:52,770 --> 02:10:54,410
Oh, that's it.

2794
02:10:54,530 --> 02:10:54,670
Yep.

2795
02:11:01,690 --> 02:11:03,530
Oh my god, new ending!

2796
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:03,690
New ending!

2797
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:12,140
I like that one more actually.

2798
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:16,740
That one was funny.

2799
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:25,920
Oh, we got a ritual token!

2800
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:26,420
Nice.

2801
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:29,600
What is this game?

2802
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:36,060
We literally...we did the exact same thing as before and we died the same way, but we thought we were so much more prepared.

2803
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:37,520
What did we know that's not true?

2804
02:11:37,980 --> 02:11:39,140
I died to the crows.

2805
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:40,380
I died a different way.

2806
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:42,080
No way, to the crows!

2807
02:11:43,620 --> 02:11:44,860
You couldn't kill them.

2808
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:46,080
They were literally like endless.

2809
02:11:46,260 --> 02:11:49,180
I just watched them like plague you like a freaky...

2810
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:52,300
You were swarmed.

2811
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:59,960
She also, like, Mint stunned her and then ran away and then she literally just like speed hacked into Mint.

2812
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:04,460
Yeah, and she even did the thing like, I'll get you next time.

2813
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:05,600
So I was like, oh, I'm safe.

2814
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:11,980
And her eyes weren't red, so it didn't really look like she wasn't gonna keep going, but she was just like, actually, bye.

2815
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:12,700
Actually, lol.

2816
02:12:12,700 --> 02:12:15,120
She was red on my screen, so I think it's also kind of buggy.

2817
02:12:15,940 --> 02:12:17,040
Oh my god.

2818
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:17,700
You know what?

2819
02:12:17,820 --> 02:12:19,360
We did really well, guys.

2820
02:12:19,420 --> 02:12:20,140
I think we did.

2821
02:12:20,140 --> 02:12:22,040
I think we did really well.

2822
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:26,180
I think we did as well as we could.

2823
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:29,300
We just didn't have any perks, so you can't blame us.

2824
02:12:29,380 --> 02:12:30,760
We just didn't have any perks.

2825
02:12:31,380 --> 02:12:33,580
Yeah, I only just got a perk now.

2826
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:36,920
Oh right, there's perks in this game.

2827
02:12:37,740 --> 02:12:40,060
I still can't actually do anything with the perks.

2828
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:40,780
It's greyed out.

2829
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:43,560
Yeah, actually I was trying to click on it.

2830
02:12:43,620 --> 02:12:44,320
It wasn't letting me.

2831
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:47,140
Yeah, I don't think we have perks.

2832
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:48,300
Oh wait, I turned it on.

2833
02:12:48,300 --> 02:12:51,300
I'm gonna spend my perk on an emote instead.

2834
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:24,800
Oh my god, this is... This is all about the grind.

2835
02:13:25,060 --> 02:13:26,600
It's about the grind, for real.

2836
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:29,040
Wait, there's hiding spots?

2837
02:13:29,940 --> 02:13:31,740
There was no hiding spots?

2838
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:33,220
It's like UV charge regen.

2839
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:34,940
Oh, it's for the spider lady.

2840
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:38,340
Because the fucking manor did not have hiding spots for sure.

2841
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:45,400
Yeah, maybe the other maps like make more sense and we accidentally just went in on like...

2842
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:48,220
The equivalent of level 15 people for some shit.

2843
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:51,380
No, I do remember some of the maps had like closets you can hide in.

2844
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:52,060
No, it doesn't.

2845
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:52,620
That's what I'm saying.

2846
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:54,180
The spider, the spider manor.

2847
02:13:54,220 --> 02:13:58,300
Yeah, but people were saying the manor was like different from how they usually do.

2848
02:13:58,660 --> 02:14:01,080
So I think they got rid of the hiding spots for the manor.

2849
02:14:01,220 --> 02:14:01,340
I don't know why.

2850
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:04,540
Oh, because this game wasn't more... It was too easy.

2851
02:14:05,860 --> 02:14:07,500
It was too easy.

2852
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:11,460
It's a sick fucking joke for getting rid of the hiding spots.

2853
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:12,600
It was not easy.

2854
02:14:12,780 --> 02:14:15,600
I remember struggling so hard on the end.

2855
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:20,480
I remember the fucking spiders.

2856
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:22,060
Yeah, I know.

2857
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:23,060
What are the spiders?

2858
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:25,420
What's the lore with that?

2859
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:32,620
There's a giant spider lady that's gonna fucking eat you and then instead of crows is other spiders that try to attack your ankles.

2860
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:33,280
Ew.

2861
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:35,100
You like try to gobble your ankles.

2862
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:37,640
Honestly, that kind of sounds fun for next time maybe.

2863
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:41,760
Yeah, I'm glad I don't have to fucking pass out right now.

2864
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:42,000
I know.

2865
02:14:43,020 --> 02:14:43,860
We'll let Lime sleep.

2866
02:14:44,600 --> 02:14:46,140
I'm so ready.

2867
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:50,100
I was like, Lime, are you okay?

2868
02:14:50,240 --> 02:14:53,780
And you just stare out into the space and I'm like, she's not okay.

2869
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:55,040
She's not okay.

2870
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:57,020
Let Lime sleep.

2871
02:14:57,980 --> 02:14:59,900
I'm trying really hard to be okay.

2872
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:01,540
No, don't.

2873
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:03,660
She's like 21 hours awake.

2874
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:07,900
I like how Lime bought the movement speed increase perk already.

2875
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:11,780
I'm ready to go fucking fast.

2876
02:15:12,340 --> 02:15:14,320
Oh my god, you really did already buy it.

2877
02:15:14,740 --> 02:15:20,120
She already bought the movement speed after getting fucked over by the bride because we were too slow.

2878
02:15:20,740 --> 02:15:22,220
I know what I'm gonna buy then.

2879
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:29,380
You can't use your fucking perks to buy emotes.

2880
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:30,460
Oh my god, I can flex.

2881
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:34,180
How do I show off this?

2882
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:38,860
The movement speed increased by 25% when pursued by a Zazel.

2883
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:41,740
How do I show off my...

2884
02:15:41,740 --> 02:15:42,960
Pursued by a Zazel?

2885
02:15:43,060 --> 02:15:44,060
Which one is a Zazel?

2886
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:45,080
Isn't that the demon?

2887
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:46,500
That's the bride.

2888
02:15:46,540 --> 02:15:47,400
Yeah, the bride.

2889
02:15:48,340 --> 02:15:50,400
What the fuck emote did you buy?

2890
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:53,520
I bought finger guns.

2891
02:15:57,520 --> 02:15:59,080
There's one where...

2892
02:15:59,080 --> 02:15:59,760
Oh my god.

2893
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:00,440
How do you do emotes?

2894
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:01,260
Wait.

2895
02:16:01,540 --> 02:16:04,260
You have to get in game for that.

2896
02:16:07,820 --> 02:16:09,180
Oh, I see the finger guns.

2897
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:10,320
This is the one I bought, right?

2898
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:12,360
I see it.

2899
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:15,080
I see the finger guns.

2900
02:16:15,580 --> 02:16:17,160
How do I buy them?

2901
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:19,380
You have to scroll down to the emote.

2902
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:20,640
Oh, I see buy now.

2903
02:16:20,820 --> 02:16:21,940
Oh, I should've bought this one.

2904
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:24,360
And you have to scroll all the way down for the perks.

2905
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:24,960
Like, you can just scroll all the way down.

2906
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:26,600
You can use your perk palismans to buy it.

2907
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:27,080
The other one.

2908
02:16:27,580 --> 02:16:29,460
Wait, so there was a finger gun that I didn't need to buy.

2909
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:31,900
Oh, this one, yeah.

2910
02:16:32,020 --> 02:16:33,540
Oh, I got the draw gun.

2911
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:35,460
Oh, wait, the finger gun is so much better.

2912
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:37,280
Oh, you did buy the finger gun?

2913
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:41,080
You have to win a game in a hard mode as Sam to get the finger gun.

2914
02:16:42,960 --> 02:16:44,240
Nevermind, I hate this game.

2915
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:48,900
You can barely do normal, guys.

2916
02:16:52,020 --> 02:16:53,380
GG's though, I had fun.

2917
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:54,600
Yeah, so much fun.

2918
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:57,860
The voices, they're gone, they're gone.

2919
02:16:59,480 --> 02:17:01,140
By the way, Min, you're muted.

2920
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:02,880
You're muted, so we can't hear you.

2921
02:17:05,060 --> 02:17:08,360
And Lime is still disassociated, so she's deafened.

2922
02:17:08,780 --> 02:17:10,600
She's just staring at her monitor.

2923
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:15,820
And Lime...

2924
02:17:16,380 --> 02:17:16,920
Undeafened.

2925
02:17:20,220 --> 02:17:22,480
Let her sleep, it's okay.

2926
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:26,080
Oh, there we go.

2927
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:29,140
I thought you guys just ditched me.

2928
02:17:29,220 --> 02:17:30,260
I was like, well, that was...

2929
02:17:30,260 --> 02:17:34,760
The voices were echoing, so we were like...

2930
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:37,800
No, I was deafened and I just completely forgot we were in Discord.

2931
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:41,580
I was like, I guess that's it, I guess they just left or whatever.

2932
02:17:45,420 --> 02:17:46,480
That was fun.

2933
02:17:47,620 --> 02:17:49,460
Yeah, it was fun.

2934
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,980
Yeah, no, next time, we just gamer it.

2935
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:53,920
And we win.

2936
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:54,880
Easy peasy.

2937
02:17:54,940 --> 02:17:55,180
Spiders.

2938
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:56,820
I'm ready to face the spiders.

2939
02:17:56,880 --> 02:17:58,240
Me too.

2940
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:01,020
Oh my gosh, we just have a whole Devour Marathon.

2941
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:05,140
A whole Devour Marathon where we never beat the game.

2942
02:18:05,180 --> 02:18:06,640
We never beat the game ever.

2943
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:09,700
We just lose over and over again.

2944
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:12,580
Double ways to die, the game.

2945
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:16,700
We can YouTube the ending, someone who bought all the perks.

2946
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:21,820
I wish I knew, I would've just bought them to start with.

2947
02:18:22,100 --> 02:18:24,340
You have to like earn the little things.

2948
02:18:24,700 --> 02:18:25,960
You can't pay to win?

2949
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:30,380
No, you can't pay to win perks, you actually have to earn them for each year playing.

2950
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:32,120
So they hate fun.

2951
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:33,520
They really do, yeah.

2952
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:39,300
That's why they want us to play, so we keep having fun.

2953
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:41,180
That's the whole point.

2954
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:45,040
I wish I could hit that woman with a shovel.

2955
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:46,660
The ghost, the ghost, not Doki.

2956
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:49,840
You can say Doki.

2957
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:51,520
Yeah, you can say.

2958
02:18:52,680 --> 02:18:56,620
I've just encountered so many croquis, like I deserved it.

2959
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:02,400
Thank you for playing.

2960
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:04,900
Thank you for playing.

2961
02:19:05,580 --> 02:19:06,940
We'll see you next time.

2962
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:08,260
Bye-bye.

2963
02:19:08,700 --> 02:19:11,040
Bye-bye.

2964
02:19:13,660 --> 02:19:14,220
Nice.

2965
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:19,080
That was a time.

2966
02:19:21,880 --> 02:19:23,840
That was a time, wasn't it guys?

2967
02:19:25,140 --> 02:19:27,420
Thanks for the streaming though, thank you guys!

2968
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:31,080
I can turn myself back to normal volume now.

2969
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:32,120
Thank you, thank you guys!

2970
02:19:35,260 --> 02:19:36,280
That was silly.

2971
02:19:36,580 --> 02:19:37,600
I liked that one.

2972
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:39,720
It's just way so many steps.

2973
02:19:39,720 --> 02:19:41,720
I mean, that's how always...

2974
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:43,940
Devour is.

2975
02:19:44,260 --> 02:19:45,880
But this one is crazy.

2976
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:48,680
Have the...

2977
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:49,460
Have the...

2978
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:50,620
First you find the...

2979
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:52,380
First you get the cakes, then you find the heads.

2980
02:19:52,460 --> 02:19:54,540
Then you purify the heads, or clean the heads.

2981
02:19:54,580 --> 02:19:55,880
And then you take the heads to the thing.

2982
02:19:55,900 --> 02:19:57,820
And then you bury the heads and...

2983
02:19:57,820 --> 02:19:59,580
Oh my gosh!

2984
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:01,180
I feel like it needs to...

2985
02:20:01,180 --> 02:20:02,880
You can't just be done with four people.

2986
02:20:02,980 --> 02:20:05,060
I feel like it needs to be like 15 people.

2987
02:20:06,820 --> 02:20:08,180
15 people to get done.

2988
02:20:10,060 --> 02:20:12,200
I am going to go...

2989
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:12,920
To sleep.

2990
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:15,700
Cause I am tired.

2991
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:18,420
10 kajillion steps the game.

2992
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:19,120
I know, right?

2993
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:21,080
I've never seen a completed game of Devour.

2994
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:22,140
Me neither!

2995
02:20:23,620 --> 02:20:25,560
Thanks for the fun collab, Devour was really hard.

2996
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:27,520
But you all had some great teamwork tonight.

2997
02:20:27,820 --> 02:20:30,420
I know it's like a lot of prep before you start, but...

2998
02:20:30,420 --> 02:20:32,960
There are some things that you can't do...

2999
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:34,980
Until...

3000
02:20:34,980 --> 02:20:35,960
Like, like...

3001
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:39,660
Like, I think we had to unlock more heads by burying people.

3002
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:42,300
And then once you start burying them...

3003
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:44,640
That's when it all ramps up, so...

3004
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:47,620
And by like five heads, it feels like you're on level 100.

3005
02:20:47,820 --> 02:20:48,640
Like, it's crazy.

3006
02:20:49,300 --> 02:20:50,460
It's so crazy.

3007
02:20:52,100 --> 02:20:53,360
But, yeah.

3008
02:20:54,300 --> 02:20:55,120
Ippii meant...

3009
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:56,040
I'm Ippii!

3010
02:20:56,300 --> 02:20:57,160
I had to...

3011
02:20:57,160 --> 02:20:59,500
I had to wake up early this morning...

3012
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:00,920
Cause I had an early...

3013
02:21:01,780 --> 02:21:03,840
Veterinarian appointment for Butaro.

3014
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:05,360
And he's okay.

3015
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:08,200
He has to wear the cone of shame.

3016
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:10,180
Cause he has a little cut on his arm.

3017
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:12,480
And he has to have medicine on it.

3018
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:13,540
Chumura!

3019
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:14,960
Look at the membership, thank you!

3020
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:16,360
Thanks for the fun collab, thank you!

3021
02:21:17,060 --> 02:21:20,100
Thank you guys, sorry I couldn't read chat so much the whole time.

3022
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:22,840
But basically, his...

3023
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:25,620
Today's appointment was just a checkup.

3024
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:29,240
And so, the doctor said that he's doing alright.

3025
02:21:30,900 --> 02:21:32,340
Yeah, the vet doctor.

3026
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:33,680
The cat doctor.

3027
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:36,800
And then next week I have to take Paz.

3028
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:40,800
Next week I take Paz...

3029
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:41,660
For her checkup.

3030
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:44,000
So...

3031
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:44,660
Yeah.

3032
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:46,700
Oh my kittens.

3033
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:48,460
Oh my kittens.

3034
02:21:51,140 --> 02:21:52,100
But, um...

3035
02:21:52,100 --> 02:21:55,140
Yeah, and then I was like busy doing other stuff today, so...

3036
02:21:55,140 --> 02:21:55,800
But it was fun!

3037
02:21:56,400 --> 02:21:57,400
Today was fun.

3038
02:21:57,860 --> 02:21:59,700
If I see you guys tomorrow, I'll see you tomorrow.

3039
02:21:59,700 --> 02:22:04,840
I might have to change some stuff with Metal Gear on Saturday.

3040
02:22:07,420 --> 02:22:07,820
Um...

3041
02:22:08,220 --> 02:22:10,380
Essentially, to kind of explain.

3042
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:12,180
So Vmuse is this weekend.

3043
02:22:13,180 --> 02:22:14,060
And, um...

3044
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:15,700
I have...

3045
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:17,860
Soundcheck?

3046
02:22:18,500 --> 02:22:20,600
That, uh, on Saturday night.

3047
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:25,880
And then I have a meet and greet at 3am mine time.

3048
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:32,140
And then I have to perform at 7am my time.

3049
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:34,840
So I'm like, when am I gonna sleep?

3050
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:42,760
I'm not sure when I'm gonna sleep.

3051
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:52,260
So I might have to move Metal Gear to maybe Sunday or Monday.

3052
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:54,340
Yeah.

3053
02:22:54,340 --> 02:22:55,220
Uh...

3054
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:58,000
I'm flying to Malaysia tomorrow.

3055
02:22:58,340 --> 02:22:59,660
Oh, wait for the concert?

3056
02:22:59,860 --> 02:23:00,340
No way.

3057
02:23:00,480 --> 02:23:01,200
Oh my gosh.

3058
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:03,660
See you there!

3059
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:07,060
Yeah.

3060
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:09,000
Sleeping is more important.

3061
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:12,200
So I will figure out when I'm gonna do it.

3062
02:23:12,680 --> 02:23:15,140
And make an end post about it.

3063
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:16,300
So, um...

3064
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:18,520
It's been Sunday the last few weeks.

3065
02:23:18,620 --> 02:23:19,680
Sunday is best.

3066
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:22,320
If I am not too tired...

3067
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:26,560
I might be able to perform and then sleep and then wake up and stream.

3068
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:30,300
I'm not sure.

3069
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:32,040
I'm not quite sure.

3070
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:37,000
Schedule says Sunday anyway.

3071
02:23:37,140 --> 02:23:38,180
It's a mistake!

3072
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:39,840
It's a mistake.

3073
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:42,280
Yeah.

3074
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:44,320
So I was like, hmm...

3075
02:23:45,020 --> 02:23:45,840
I don't think...

3076
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:51,020
Well, I didn't know what time the meet and greet would be until after I made my schedule.

3077
02:23:51,020 --> 02:23:53,020
So, um...

3078
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:58,520
I thought that maybe if I even started Metal Gear a little bit earlier, I'd be okay.

3079
02:23:59,540 --> 02:24:00,140
But...

3080
02:24:00,140 --> 02:24:00,820
Yeah.

3081
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:04,720
Accidental prediction.

3082
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:07,560
Yeah.

3083
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:12,160
So...

3084
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:12,880
But, uh...

3085
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:15,660
I think this is like my last big event.

3086
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:20,320
Well, rather event on the other side of the world.

3087
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:21,680
So...

3088
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:23,000
For this year.

3089
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:26,660
I think.

3090
02:24:28,660 --> 02:24:30,660
There will always be more Saturdays for Metal Gear.

3091
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:33,040
Yeah.

3092
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:35,400
But yeah.

3093
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:35,740
Anyway.

3094
02:24:36,820 --> 02:24:37,500
What event is this?

3095
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:38,380
It's called Vmuse.

3096
02:24:38,480 --> 02:24:41,680
It's a concert that I will be doing in...

3097
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:45,080
In Malaysia.

3098
02:24:45,460 --> 02:24:46,740
But there's also a streaming ticket.

3099
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:48,700
So...

3100
02:24:48,700 --> 02:24:50,300
I saw the AWA announcement.

3101
02:24:50,300 --> 02:24:51,000
Oh yeah!

3102
02:24:52,980 --> 02:24:53,900
Well, there's...

3103
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:54,310
I think...

3104
02:24:55,060 --> 02:24:57,300
If you're not going to AWA...

3105
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:01,040
You might...

3106
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:02,800
Want to see if you can.

3107
02:25:03,400 --> 02:25:04,280
Is all I'll say.

3108
02:25:07,140 --> 02:25:08,060
Is all...

3109
02:25:08,060 --> 02:25:09,020
I will say.

3110
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:11,280
Yeah, yeah.

3111
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:13,480
Big, big stuff.

3112
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:15,200
The Anime Week in Atlanta?

3113
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:16,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3114
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:18,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3115
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:21,160
I hope one day I'll be able to go to a meet and greet.

3116
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:23,480
But I don't know that will ever happen.

3117
02:25:23,540 --> 02:25:24,520
In the meantime, I hope it goes well.

3118
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:25,420
Thank you.

3119
02:25:26,460 --> 02:25:27,600
If you ever...

3120
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:29,020
If I ever get to meet you at a meet and greet...

3121
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:30,460
You have to tell me what your name is though.

3122
02:25:30,500 --> 02:25:31,880
You have to say it out loud to my face.

3123
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:35,780
You have to say it out loud to my face.

3124
02:25:42,220 --> 02:25:42,860
But yeah.

3125
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:44,060
There's a...

3126
02:25:44,620 --> 02:25:46,260
Definitely cooking for...

3127
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:47,200
And also...

3128
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:48,020
I think...

3129
02:25:48,020 --> 02:25:50,200
AWA has the...

3130
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:53,020
Hololive concert, so...

3131
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:53,980
There's that.

3132
02:25:54,660 --> 02:25:55,520
And then there's...

3133
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:56,000
Other stuff.

3134
02:25:56,940 --> 02:25:58,140
It'll be a very...

3135
02:25:58,760 --> 02:25:59,580
Packed weekend.

3136
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:03,280
A very, very packed weekend, I think.

3137
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:04,240
I would in a heartbeat.

3138
02:26:04,480 --> 02:26:04,840
Okay, good.

3139
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:09,640
Oh gosh.

3140
02:26:14,940 --> 02:26:15,660
Anyway.

3141
02:26:15,660 --> 02:26:15,800
Okay.

3142
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:17,820
Otsumito, everybody.

3143
02:26:18,020 --> 02:26:18,880
I'm gonna go rest.

3144
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:20,280
Even though I've been drinking this coffee.

3145
02:26:20,360 --> 02:26:21,220
I've been sipping on it.

3146
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:23,880
My name is John.

3147
02:26:24,220 --> 02:26:24,820
John Doe.

3148
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:30,520
See you at Vmuse.

3149
02:26:32,100 --> 02:26:34,900
Maple, if I don't see you at the meet and greet...

3150
02:26:34,900 --> 02:26:36,580
I better see your ass there, okay?

3151
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:39,320
For real.

3152
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:40,940
Call me a snake.

3153
02:26:43,460 --> 02:26:44,960
No, that is not a solid snake.

3154
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:47,380
I better see your ass there.

3155
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:51,840
Akidoki!

3156
02:26:53,980 --> 02:26:55,160
Oh my gosh.

3157
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:56,940
You guys, I'm so excited...

3158
02:26:58,820 --> 02:26:59,500
For...

3159
02:26:59,500 --> 02:26:59,940
Halloween.

3160
02:27:01,020 --> 02:27:02,920
Only three more weeks...

3161
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:04,700
Until I get to finally use...

3162
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:06,760
I get to transform.

3163
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:10,160
Call me Deepthroat.

3164
02:27:11,380 --> 02:27:12,700
Who are you?

3165
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:14,560
One of your fans.

3166
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:20,580
3.0 Minto.

3167
02:27:22,180 --> 02:27:23,000
And other stuff.

3168
02:27:23,980 --> 02:27:27,540
I'm planning a lot for the debut.

3169
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:32,000
Not everything will be finished, unfortunately.

3170
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,480
But I will be able to at least share...

3171
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:36,420
Everything, too.

3172
02:27:42,220 --> 02:27:44,680
3.0 Minto kinda rhymes.

3173
02:27:44,820 --> 02:27:45,440
It does!

3174
02:27:47,140 --> 02:27:48,480
Minto 3.0.

3175
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:53,280
Exciting times.

3176
02:27:53,660 --> 02:27:54,600
I'm so excited!

3177
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:55,180
Oh my gosh.

3178
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:57,860
I've been working on stuff everyday for it.

3179
02:28:00,880 --> 02:28:02,460
Things are being prepped.

3180
02:28:03,920 --> 02:28:05,680
And my team is working hard, too.

3181
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:11,700
Okay, for real.

3182
02:28:11,900 --> 02:28:12,580
I'm gonna go.

3183
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:14,220
Sorry, I didn't get to talk to you guys at all.

3184
02:28:14,220 --> 02:28:15,140
So I'm like...

3185
02:28:15,140 --> 02:28:16,140
Kind of in a yappy mood.

3186
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:17,420
But I'll yap tomorrow.

3187
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:20,400
Maybe on Saturday we could do like a...

3188
02:28:20,400 --> 02:28:23,500
Well, maybe I'll do something else instead of...

3189
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:24,080
Metal Gear.

3190
02:28:24,140 --> 02:28:25,360
Maybe like a shorter...

3191
02:28:26,100 --> 02:28:26,920
Kind of stream.

3192
02:28:27,060 --> 02:28:28,440
Maybe like a hangout or something.

3193
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:29,560
Good night!

3194
02:28:30,440 --> 02:28:32,380
Thank you so much for the dono!

3195
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:33,380
Thank you!

3196
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:36,560
Saturday we'll still do something.

3197
02:28:36,760 --> 02:28:38,180
I just, you know...

3198
02:28:38,180 --> 02:28:40,200
My name reflects my true feelings.

3199
02:28:45,460 --> 02:28:47,880
We are too comfortable in this community, maybe.

3200
02:28:48,140 --> 02:28:49,120
Excited for 3.02.

3201
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:50,420
Good luck, Minto.

3202
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:51,040
Thank you.

3203
02:28:52,660 --> 02:28:54,140
Okay, I'm gonna leave now.

3204
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:56,000
Turquoise woman yapping, my beloved.

3205
02:28:57,340 --> 02:28:58,600
Okay, bye bye!

3206
02:28:58,920 --> 02:28:59,720
Bye bye, bye bye!

3207
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:01,500
Bye bye, bring back shame.

3208
02:29:03,560 --> 02:29:04,640
Bye bye, OtsuMinto!

3209
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:05,280
Thank you guys!

3210
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:05,860
Thank you!

3211
02:29:05,940 --> 02:29:06,460
See you!

3212
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:07,880
Good night, good night, good night.

3213
02:29:07,980 --> 02:29:08,440
Bye bye!

3214
02:29:09,160 --> 02:29:10,120
Devil may cry tomorrow.

3215
02:29:10,280 --> 02:29:10,900
Let's go!
