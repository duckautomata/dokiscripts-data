You can take their picture.

125
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,750
It's like a dating sim.

126
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,830
But they take your money.

127
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,050
Yeah.

128
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,550
And you think you drink alcohol?

129
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,130

130
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,090
And you can take a picture with them.

131
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,210
No, not with them, but you take a picture of girl.

132

134
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,290

135
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:22,890

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,630
You can go on vacation with them.

137
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,190
Oh, that's what I'm trying to do.

138
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,830
Are we just going to glaze over the fact about giving
underwear to these women who are working?

139
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,150
It's a gift.

140
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,030
They like it.

141
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,870
The gift of lingerie.

142
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,730
Yeah, I like it.

143
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,590
So my favorite game in Yakuza Zero was the hostess game.

144
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,790
Oh, you'll love this then.

145
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,550
You'll love this.

146
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,910
You'll love it.

147
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,310
But people are going to know that I'm a pervert.

148
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,830
I don't want them to know that.

149
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,850
That's okay.

150
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,930
I don't want them to know that I'm a pervert.

151
00:15:53,070 --> 00:16:00,810

158
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,090
It's called socializing.

159
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,330
I think I'm very good at getting good at socializing now.

160
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:24,970
It's so true.

161
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,510
Before this, I would be too scared to go to a bunny girl
bar.

162
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,430
But now I think I feel very confident.

163
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,770
I live there.

164
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,170

So this is the socializing in 2024?

166
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:38,690
Yes.

167
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,710
Yes.

168
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,290
Okay.

169
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,930

217
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:34,690
I like the fact that the short hair girl has like a gradient
black to blue in the tips of her hair.

218
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,030
Oh, yeah.

219
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,690

221
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,110
I like her hair a lot.

222
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,250

You like my hair?

224
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,070

Yeah.

230
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,430
Nijan is so cute.

231
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,410
You just got married and she's already replacing with a
virtual wife.

232
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,210
That's so sad.

233
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,090
That's kind of the reality of things, isn't it?

234
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:03,710
Yeah.

235
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,310

Oh, it keeps your name keeps like popping up.

241
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,930
I think it's like the games try to remind you I exist.

242
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,170
It keeps just saying it's like scrolling.

243
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,410

Harder?

251
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,350
I only played this game once for two hours.

252
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,430
Yeah, normal is good.

253
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,030

257
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,770

259
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:45,810
Hold on.

260
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:46,730
I'm getting rid of steam.

261
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,050

262
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,710

266
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,290
Wait, is that a makeup?

267
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,030

268
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,330
Oh, it was actually very cute.

269
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,330

270
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,310
Shut the fuck.

271
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,410
It was so cute.

272
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,770
I will literally strangle you with Rinchan's bunny ears.

273
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:05,930
Oh, my goodness.

274
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,390
Oh, you're turning me on.

275
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,390
Wait, what?

276
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,470

277
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,510
Don't look, everybody!

278
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,450

Oh, no.

284
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,570
Did the game really crash?

285
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,170
Yeah, hold on.

Man, your laugh.

288
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,700
When I was in the loading screen, I thought that was part of
the game and I was severely freaked out.

289
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,300
Yeah, I was a little scared.

290
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,580

Oh.

323
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,060
Anything I need to know about the game?

324
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,860
My wallet's getting slashed.

325
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,380
Wait, is this your phone?

326
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,860
first time playing Matara.

327
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,880
I played like one time a few years ago, but I don't know if
it was this Left 4 Dead or Left 4 Dead 1, because I didn't

328
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,680
own this game.

329
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,520
So I don't know if I played this game or if I played the
pre- I own Left 4 Dead 1.

330
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:23,940
Okay.

331
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,520
Um, maybe it's a 1.

332
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,560
Just shoot.

333
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:27,820
Just shoot.

334
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,380
Yeah, I figured.

335
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,280
Is there like melee?

336
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,320
Is there anything like special that I need to know?

337
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,580
I think this, the first level will kind of teach you the
controls.

338
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:34,960
Yeah.

339
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,860

I should have really saved this for this.

385
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,760
A bunch of people on fire.

386
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,360
Oh shit, I forgot about this one.

387
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:44,800

00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,340
Hunt!

391
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:49,660

393
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,540
No!

394
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:51,960
Hunter has come.

395
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,040
How did you know we're coming?

396
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:53,980
I'm coming!

397
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,080
Hold on, I got you behind.

398
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,000
Behind, behind, behind.

399
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,100
Oh, sorry.

400
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,800
I keep forgetting if you get puked on it, we'll start a
horde.

401
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,840
It'll come towards you.

402
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,420
Oh no.

403
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,140
Oh my god.

404
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,540
Mint protected Matara Khan.

405
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,300
That's my girl.

406
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,640
Get out of my way.

407
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,460
I'm not trying to protect you at all.

408
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,040
Wait, I can't hold a katana and gun at the same time?

409
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,620
No, you can only have, like, one thing.

410
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,120
No way!

411
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,580
Uh-oh, it's all fiery down there.

412
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,540
So if I didn't use the axe, did I have less blood?

413
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,840
Because I cannot see anything.

414
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,500
I hate it.

415
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:31,940
Oh, sorry.

416
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,520
Oh, fuck.

417
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,120
Oh, my health.

418
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,160
Sorry.

419
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,460
Sorry.

420
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,500
Sorry, I just saw Waluigi.

421
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,180
Waluigi.

422
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,460
Waluigi.

423
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,540
Oh, my God.

424
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,500
Girls, if you see another weapon on the floor that is in a
gun, can you let me know?

425
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:46,840
Yeah.

426
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,960
How do I get down there?

427
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,000
Get adrenaline.

428
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,480
Should have grabbed the gun.

429
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,200
Should have could have would have.

430
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,020

00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,000

No.

479
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,110
This is starting off good.

480
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,450
I think this is starting off real nice.

481
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,850
Shove them back.

482
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,690
All right.

483
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,790
Let's stick together.

484
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:03,510
Maybe.

485
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:10,110
And also, you know, I lost a lot of health from like, I
don't know, it was like PvP, you know, like, from team.

Like, you know, like.

487
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,190
Henya kept attacking you.

488
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,830
Why did you do that, Henya?

489
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,210
Wait, what?

490
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,230
Why were you attacking Mint?

491
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,510
No, no, no.

492
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,670
You gotta get good.

493
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,310
Not blaming on me, Nygote.

494
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,090
Alright, let's try this again.

00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:26,950

Stick together.

00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,690
Greatest of all time, as they say.

00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,990
They say the same thing about me and Mango, actually.

502
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:39,850

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,890

You better watch out.

521
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,910
Watch out!

522
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,570
Is there anything down here?

Okay.

595
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,750
I played like the one round of this game.

596
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,390
That's some sort of nightmare.

597
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,610
God damn zombie apocalypse.

598
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,330

599
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,170
Zombie apocalypse.

Weapons better.

601
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,170
Shit, shit.

00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:17,670
Shit.

603
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,310
Depends on, I think, your play style, right?

604
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,150
Hmm.

605
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,470
But I think that axe is kind of...

606
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,430
My name's Alice.

607
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,310
Uh-oh, guys, I can't see well.

608
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,230
Amelia is saying that she's coach on my...

609
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,090
Guys, I think we're gonna die.

610
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,790
Guys, I think we're gonna die.

611
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,870

00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,590
I don't know.

614
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,550
Probably the door's open.

615
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,630
Just hoarding a little bit.

616
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:42,510

707
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:19,810
It's a cat.

708
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,250
It's a cat.

709
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,390
So when have I shoot it?

710
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,710
Oh, thank you everybody.

711
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,510
There's a heart.

712
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:24,650
I've popped out of the car.

713
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:24,850
What?

714
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,390

715
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,470
What about this one?

716
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:26,990
Wait, I don't see it.

717
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:27,510
A shotgun.

718
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,010
Just a regular shotgun.

719
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,130
Oh, okay.

720
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,970
I see from my side.

721
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,990
That's cool.

722
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,370
I should do the mods next time.

723
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,390
I don't know if I should bring the shotgun or the can.

724
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,090
They're really easy to use too.

725
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,350
Oh, really?

726
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,630
Yeah, it's really easy too.

727
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,330
I'm gonna bring the shotty.

728
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,170
Yeah, I got a shotgun too.

729
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:46,350

730
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,010

What you up?

737
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,490
Oh my god, please.

738
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:09,030
I'm like missing, I'm always missing like an inch or two.

739
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,110
I feel like I keep thinking that I'm just like an inch or
two longer than I really am.

740
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:14,170
Jeez.

741
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,370
Get off of me.

742
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,350
I hate that.

743
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,370
Does that ever happen to anybody else?

744
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,410
What is it?

745
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,670
Now you're your primary.

746
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,430
I'm a little longer than I am.

747
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,750
But your pistol won't happen.

748
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,790
You're pretty long on my stream.

749
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,370
Oh, I don't want my little longer.

750
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:33,910
Oh my god.

751
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,770
Oh my god, please.

752
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,330
I'm reloading.

753
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:36,950

754
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,450
Oh shit, I need help.

Alright, I can't wait to bring up this Pepsi gun.

766
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:33,110
The craziest thing is, like, how much the game shakes when
you're trying to do anything is just so fast.

767
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:36,570
It is very, it's a super fast, fast pace game.

768
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:37,690
So fast.

769
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:38,130

00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,010

00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:06,010
So the witch, if you wake her up, she'll scream and alert
every single zombie round.

786
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,870
Yeah, it's kind of not great.

787
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,810
Oh, it's a zombie around too.

788
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,990
Apologize, but I've also never played those before.

789

816
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,930
I think we have to go down here.

817
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:46,350
It's okay.

818
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,330
We'll get more health soon.

819
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:47,910
Down here?

820
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,090

826
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:10,790

Thank you.

832
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:22,710
What is this?

833
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,050
What is this?

834
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:24,930
Oh, I got it.

835
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,190

I got pills here.

837
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:28,390
Pills here.

838
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,050
No, that's a grenade.

839
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,650
So the bile will damage the enemies, right?

840
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:34,570
If I throw it.

841
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:35,150
Hold on.

842
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:35,450
I want to.

843
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:36,330
Oh, yeah.

844
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,330

So it's easier to.

848
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:41,810
Oh, nice.

849
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:42,930
How do you got?

850
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,150

So it's like a.

853

00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,190
It came from above.

855
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:51,170

Right here, right here.

00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:56,750
Do you want it?

862
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:57,610
It can have it.

863
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,810
It has gas though, I'm pretty sure.

864
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,090
Gas, gas, gas.

865
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,210

Good job.

903
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,910
Oh, it's all on fire though.

Give me fire!

913
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,270
What is this?

914
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,230
Pills here.

915
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,270
Oh, pills for health.

916
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:06,190
What's this one?

917
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:06,950
Is this a shotgun?

918
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,230
What's this one?

919
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,110
Oh, sniper!

920
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:10,690

My beloved.

924
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,390
I have some ammo on my hand as well if we need.

925
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:19,610
Uh oh.

00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:26,630
Peace.

933
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:28,290

Thank you.

938
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,150
God, I love a little gun.

939
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,570
The little gun that could, you know?

940
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,830
Do we go down or do we go up?

941
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,250
Oh, I think we go down.

942
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:49,770

1055
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:32,590
What?

1056
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:33,770

1058
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:36,470
Laser sight.

1062
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,430

1063
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:50,350

Okay, I'm going to get a combat shotgun.

1068
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:00,050
Also, is the golf club good?

1069
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:02,290

00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:19,650

00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:22,310
We need a code.

1082
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,830
I want the snacks too.

1083
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:26,770
You better not try to whiz a lot of this.

1084
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:29,910
We gotta go to the store and get some snacks for this guy.

1085
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:30,670
Yay, corn!

1086

00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,370

We have to bring the cola back to the gun owner.

1162
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,340
Wait, where is the smoker?

00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,720
Oh, he's up here!

1164
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,000
He's on the roof!

1165
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,160
He's on the roof!

1166
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,040

00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,780

1177
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,040
Yeah, we gotta deliver the coke.

1178

Can I go back in the safe room and reload or is that
cheesing?

1351
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,780
You can go, I'm thinking.

01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:46,300
You can.

1353
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,880

01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:03,340
None!

1363
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,820
Why am I taking so long for reload?

1364
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:06,240
Hello?

1365
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,000

1366
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:08,600
Oh, boy.

1367
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:10,780

1368
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,300

1369
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:12,760

Get the Molotov.

1377
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:51,400
For me, the spitter is Waluigi, which I thought was funny.

1378
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,440

The Waluigi cart song plays when he arrives every time
it's...

1423
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,260
Can you get her out of her?

1424
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:37,840
I think you have to kill her before she gets alerted, or you
have to sneak by.

1425
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:38,440
I can't.

1426
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:40,620
Yeah, you can sneak by.

1427
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,640
I don't hear her.

1428
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:43,740
I hear her.

1429
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,580
Yeah, I can hear her.

1430
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,680
I would say, but aren't the bullets going to alert her?

1431
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:50,040
Just sneak around the witch because she'll...

1432
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,060
Oh, oh, I ain't being fine.

1433
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:53,500
I got him.

1434
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,800
Oh, ow, John.

1435
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,920
Oh, guys, I'm going to throw a pipe bomb.

1436
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,480
Dude, dude, dude, dude.

1437
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,600
Uh-oh.

1438
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,340
I got him.

1439
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,720
Nice, nice.

1440
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,580
Nice, nice.

1441
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,300
Oh, you saved me.

1442
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:10,800
Thank you.

1443
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:11,620
Oh, my God.

1444
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,160
Reloading.

1445
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:13,560
I have 11 bullets left.

1446
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:14,740
Reloading.

1447
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,580
If anybody sees ammo, let me know.

1448
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:17,820
Let's look around.

1449
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,600
Oh, vile, vile.

1450
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,700
Vile, spitter, spitter, spitter, spitter, spitty.

1451
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,040
Wait, where is he?

1452
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:26,400
Did they switch to your pistol matta because that's has I
don't have a pistol.

1453
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:27,260
I have a katana.

1454
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,260
Do you want me to sit or heal you?

1455
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:30,660
Yes, please.

1456
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,380
I am dying.

1457
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,320
There's bathrooms and stuff.

1458
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,160
I'm gonna check in them.

1459
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:34,340
Oh, guys, there's ammo here.

1460
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,680
There's ammo in the men's bathroom.

1461
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,300
Thank you, Meant.

1462
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,720
You're better than Rin, Sean.

1463
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:40,480
Any day.

1464
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,100
Whoever she is.

1465
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,260
Ammo in the men's bathroom, girls, if you want.

1466
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:45,560
Men's bathroom?

1467
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:45,780
Well, I want it.

1468
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:46,900
Yeah, men's bathroom.

1469
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:47,760
The other one.

1470
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,580
The other men's bathroom.

1471
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,660
Oh, well, is there no one in the ladies' restrooms?

1472
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,600
This one?

1473
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,000
I can't see in here.

1474
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:55,800
Amma!

1475
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,060
Amma!

1476
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,140
Oh my god.

1477
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:58,960
I just looked.

1478
01:06:59,180 --> 01:06:59,480
Wait, what?

1479
01:06:59,640 --> 01:06:59,980
Are you okay?

1480
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:00,800
I heard something.

1481
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:04,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, big boy.

1482
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:06,020
Oh, big boy.

1483
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,640
Oh, sorry if I shot you.

1484
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,040
Ah, P.C.'s done.

1485
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,600
Oh, my god.

1486
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,760
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

1487
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,860
The smoker is Ronald McDonald for me.

1488
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:18,800
Oh, it's me.

1489
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:19,900
Hold on, hold on.

1490
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,320
Can we take, like, one second before we advance because my
eyes in the dark with the light.

1491
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:25,860
Oh my god.

1492
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,020
Are you okay?

1493
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:27,640
Are you okay?

1494
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,200
Are you okay, Mrs. Puff?

1495
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:28,760
I'm old.

1496
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,060
Oh, are you okay?

1497
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,520
I'm so old.

1498
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,660
Stop calling me Mrs. Puff.

1499
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,800
It's like taking me out, please.

1500
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:36,620
You have to stop.

1501
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,780
That's what you are.

1502
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,160
You're Mrs. Puff with the skinny legs.

1503
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:41,900
What about me?

1504
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:42,660
What am I?

1505
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,540
You're Garfield.

1506
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,960
Oh, Garfield.

1507
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:46,860
The cat.

1508
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,380
Yeah.

1509
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:48,380
Alright.

1510
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:49,500
Oh.

1511
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:50,200
I still hear.

1512
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,040
I'm actually... Here, come out of the dark.

1513
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:52,960
Come out of the darkness.

1514
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,140
We gotta go upstairs anyway, so...

1515
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,300
Out of the darkness!

1516
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:58,340
Into the dark cloud!

1517
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,860
Oh, there's the witch!

1518
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:01,680
There's the witch!

1519
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:01,940
Oh, shit!

1520
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,280
Oh!

1521
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,000
I'm sorry!

1522
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:07,120
No!

1523
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,060
I can't find...

1524
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,900
It's so much right here at the elevator!

1525
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,880
Even at the elevator!

1526
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:14,680
Ah!

1527
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:15,500
Yeah!

1528
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,080
Ah!

1529
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,500
I'm pinned!

1530
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:18,260
Help me!

1531
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,560
Oh, fuck, I also am pinned.

1532
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:20,460
I'm also impinned!

1533
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,660
I also impinned!

1534
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:22,620
Help!

1535
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:23,840
Help!

1536
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,280
I'm gonna die!

1537
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,620
I'm dead!

1538
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,440
I'm dead!

1539
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:30,440
I'm dead!

1540
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:30,800
I'm dead!

1541
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:31,320
I'm dead!

1542
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:32,100
I'm dead!

1543
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,360
I'm dead!

1544
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:35,540
I'm dead!

1545
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:36,280
What?

1546
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:36,960
I'm dead.

1547
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,620
No, no!

1548
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,900
How is this game on normal?

1549
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,800
It's so hard on normal.

1550
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,720
We saved me, Daew!

1551
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,340
We gotta go.

1552
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:49,780
I can barely walk.

1553
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:50,660
Is there no health kit?

1554
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,280
Oh, health kit.

1555
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,020
Yeah, I think Mint or Haru should take it.

1556
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,240
You guys have less HP than me.

1557
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,440
I think Haru carries better than I do.

1558
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,380
Let me die.

1559
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,640
But you're limping, though.

1560
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,500
It's okay.

1561
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:01,400
Whatever you want.

1562
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,100
Haru, I'm not against you taking it, because I think
you're...

1563
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:04,720
She's healing.

1564
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:05,580
She's healing.

1565
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:06,400
I can tell.

1566
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:07,180
I can tell.

1567
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:07,400
Sorry.

1568
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:09,340
Do you like my dance moves, man?

1569
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:11,720
Oh!

1570
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:12,320
You good?

1571
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:13,100
Oh, oh!

1572
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,300
Oh, my God.

1573
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:16,880
You okay?

1574
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:17,480
Oh, my God.

1575
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:17,800
You okay?

1576
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,180
Oh, he was right behind me.

1577
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,480
Oh,

1578
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:32,600
I'm down again.

1579
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,040
I'm down, I'm down, I'm down.

1580
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,360
Oh, I'm down, down, down, down, down, down,

1581
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:43,980
down, down, down, down, down, down.

1582
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:44,420
I love you.

1583
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:45,980
We sing.

1584
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,900
Hania, this was actually amazing.

1585
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,140
Could you please keep singing?

1586
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:50,900
You're welcome.

1587
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,120
Such a big buff to me.

1588
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,380
I have first aid needed.

1589
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,680
Next knockdown means death.

1590
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,080
Oh, flesh.

1591
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,040
I'm dead, dead, dead.

1592
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:03,000
Hold on, there's like healing, there might be healing kids
here, girls.

1593
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,500
Can you come with me real quick?

1594
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:06,680
Oh, there might be healing kids here.

1595
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,120
I'm headshotting some zombos, which were teletopies in my
vision.

1596
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:09,920
I can't see anything.

1597
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:10,880
Everything's black and white.

1598
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,340
I also can't see anything.

1599
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,280
I'm like a dog.

1600
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,500
Oh, boomer has vomited.

1601
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:14,280
Boomer, boomer.

1602
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,840
Uh oh, he's, oh, there's a charger coming.

1603
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,520
I'll hide it behind you.

1604
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:19,040
Nice.

Is my gun gone?

1858
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:41,650
Yeah, go pick it up, maybe.

1859
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:42,410
There's a med kit here!

1860
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:43,130
There's a med kit here!

1861
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:45,070
I mean, so much just my gun, but that's fine.

1862
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:45,950
I'll take this cap.

1863
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:46,430
Oh, I don't.

1864
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:48,110
Oh, maybe I took your gun by accident.

1865
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:48,410
Shit.

1866
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:49,470
Wait, actually, how do...

1867

That's okay.

1869
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:52,430
Do you want the cap?

1870
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:53,090
No, no, I want...

1871
01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:53,510
Can we switch?

1872
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:55,470
Uh, how do I drop the gun?

1873
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:56,070
Charger around.

1874
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:56,570
Get ready.

1875
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:57,270
Where's the charger?

1876
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:58,590
How do we drop the gun?

1877
01:21:59,130 --> 01:21:59,850
Oh, watch out!

1878
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:01,370
Sorry if I shot you.

1879
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,910
I'm assuming you had this gun in my hand, I'm assuming.

1880
01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:05,210
Hold on.

1881
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:06,930
Let me accidentally pick up another gun.

1882
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:07,610
Let's see if that works.

1883
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:08,710
Did I steal your...

1884
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:09,810
I didn't pick up a gun yet.

1885
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:13,110
Oh, I think I accidentally took your gun because I was
pressing E.

1886
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:14,050
Wait, how do I...

1887
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:14,490
Hold on, hold on.

1888
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:15,450
How do I drop it?

1889
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:16,010
Okay.

1890
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:16,830

1891
01:22:17,150 --> 01:22:17,510
How do I drop it?

1892
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:17,530
There's a gun.

Are we going back downstairs?

01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:30,960
I think so.

1941
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,920
What is this music I'm hearing?

1942
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:34,180
We're going the right way.

1943
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:39,080
If you guys see ammo on the floor, Oh, sorry.

1944
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:45,440
I think I need a gun so that you guys don't accidentally
shoot me.

1945
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:46,940
Yeah, you keep running in front of our shot.

1946
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:47,540
Oh, Jackie!

1947
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:50,660
Yeah, I think I need a pistol.

1948
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:52,660
Oh, my mom.

1949
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,640
You can always get a pistol because it's infantry.

1950
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:55,880
Yeah, I think so.

1951
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:56,920
Over this katana.

1952
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,820
Yeah, the melee is really strong, but it's hard to use
sometimes.

1953
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:01,520
Yeah.

1954
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,380
What is this music I'm hearing?

1955
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,020
It's like an accordion.

1956
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:05,640
It's me.

1957
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:06,420
A music?

1958
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:10,080
I think it's one of the mods that I have, but I don't know
what it means.

1959
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:11,220
Oh, my gosh.

1960
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,360
Oh, my gosh.

1961
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,420
Thank you.

1962
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:19,160
I protected my- Ah, she, I protected my O-Shee.

1963
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,340
And you keep going down.

1964
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:23,760
You keep going down.

1965
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,160
Come on, Mrs. Pop.

1966
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:25,600
Oh, no.

1967
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:26,540
Take it easy, Mrs. Pop.

1968
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:27,640
If I die, it's forever.

1969
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:28,600
Oh, no.

1970
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,980
Yeah, I think Millie is like, tough.

1971
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:32,920
Nice, sir.

1972
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,140
Where is the safe room?

1973
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:38,580
Oh, is it?

1974
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,660
Oh, no, not this one.

1975
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:40,120
Oh, what?

1976
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,060
Maybe, like, we have to go up?

1977
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,880
Do you remember, Haruka?

1978
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:44,880
I'm hearing the smoker.

1979
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:45,980
I'm hearing Ronald McDonald.

1980
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:46,900
Oh, here he is.

1981
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:47,560
I see him.

1982
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:47,960
Watch out.

1983
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:48,280
Watch out.

1984
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:49,720
Oh, I got hit.

1985
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:51,460
You got him?

1986
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,000
Oh, that was close to my head.

1987
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,000
What are you, son of a bitch?

1988
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,120
Where do we go from you?

1989
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:56,900
You have a med kit?

1990
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:57,460
Oh, upstairs?

1991
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,900
Oh, people are saying third floor.

1992
01:25:59,300 --> 01:25:59,560
Third floor?

1993
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:00,720
Oh, the third floor?

1994
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:01,580
Third floor?

1995
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,420
I forgot I had a med kit on me.

1996
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,300
I'm such an idiot.

1997
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:05,420
Oh, you have one?

1998
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:05,920
Nice.

1999
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:07,260
Oh, spitter, spitter, spitter, spitter!

2000
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,160
Ouch!

2001
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:08,540
Ouch!

2002
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:08,880
Ouch!

2003
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:09,060
Ouch!

2004
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,200
Oh, it's easy.

2005
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:11,760
Oh, it's easy!

2006
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,000
Mrs. Puff!

2007
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,620
Mrs. Puff!

2008
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:16,860
It's okay.

2009
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:17,600
We'll get you.

2010
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:18,280
Oh, thanks, Haruka.

2011
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:18,980
This is it.

2012
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:19,880
Yeah, did it.

2013
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:20,420
Safe room.

2014
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:21,460
Safe room!

2015
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,000
Nice!

2016
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:26,680
Nice.

2017
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:27,900
Come on.

2018
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,480
Get in, get in!

2019
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:30,220
Come on!

2020
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:31,020
Get in, Haru!

2021
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:31,680
Get in!

2022
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:32,260
Nice!

2023
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:33,460
Yeah!

2024
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,760
Good job!

2025
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:38,760
Yay!

2026
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:40,980
Yata!

2027
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,200
I have no idea what I'm doing.

2028
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:45,300
You got this.

2029
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,220
Yeah, look at you, you're the tank slayer.

2030
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,040
I'm the tank slayer.

2031
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,140
I hit the big man with my gun.

2032
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,380
This map is confusing.

2033
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:55,640
Nicely done.

2034
01:26:56,860 --> 01:26:58,080
I love this game.

2035
01:26:58,780 --> 01:26:59,920
Me too, it's fun.

2036
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,720
It's actually really fun.

2037
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:03,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2038
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:06,700
I like it though.

2039
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:09,840
How can you read which one it is, is what?

2040
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:14,520
Oh, you can see it says, like, sniper rifle AK-47 combat
shotgun.

2041
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:15,880
No, it doesn't say for me.

2042
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,560
If you right-click, you could shove your enemies away.

2043
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:19,880
Hold on, hold on.

2044
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:22,240
Can I pee super quickly before you open the door?

2045
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:22,820
Yeah, of course.

2046
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,320
I'm just going to go, like, two seconds.

2047
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:29,080
One, two, two.

2048
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:34,480
If you wanted to shove the zombies away, you could just
right-click.

2049
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:36,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right-click.

2050
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:37,280
It's helpful.

2051
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:37,820
Boom.

2052
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:40,620
Boom.

2053
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:42,600
Change the knife or a gun?

2054
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:44,860
Oh, but there's no, like, pistols or anything.

2055
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:50,920
Can we get a pistol in the future, or is that the only thing
we get at the bigger game?

2056
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,480
Or some smaller gun.

2057
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,100
I think there's a pistol in the future, I think.

2058
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:55,340
Oh, okay, okay.

2059
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:56,720
It's this one, right?

2060
01:27:58,340 --> 01:27:59,720
I don't see any zombies.

2061
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,820
Let's go with AKs.

2062
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:04,120
I'm with you.

2063
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,320
Oh, yeah, the cricket bat.

2064
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:07,200
Yeah, that's true.

2065
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:10,060
No more knife.

2066
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:14,640
No more knif-y, is what I like to say.

2067
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,360
No more kidney.

2068
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,400
Kidney?

2069
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:19,240
No more kidney.

2070
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,060
Kidney-y.

2071
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:23,460
You're looking really dashing, Haruka.

2072
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:25,760
Thanks, what do I look like?

2073
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:26,920
Can I get a yee-ha?

2074
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:28,940
Yee-ha!

2075
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:30,120
Yay!

2076
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:31,280
Yeah!

2077
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,100
Was that good?

2078
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,800
Oh yeah, that was so good.

2079
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,280
Thanks, thanks.

2080
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:36,760

2085
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:11,620
Oh, no.

2086
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,600
You'll get another sniper scope.

2087
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:14,000
You'll need another.

2088
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2089
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:15,380
I'm not too worried.

2090
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:16,540
All right, are we ready?

2091
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:18,980
Are you ready?

2092
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,340
I'm ready.

2093
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,240
Ricky is talking shit to me.

01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:23,300
Which one is that?

2095
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:28,300
He's telling me that Haruka is doing all the objectives and
I'm useless.

2096
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:29,920
Oh, thanks, Ricky.

2097
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:31,460
Don't believe the signs.

2098
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:34,040
Washing your hands won't help when they attack you.

2099
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:35,620
Who is Seda?

well as my previous gun feels harder to aim this one hey i

2103
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:11,860

gun had like the little laser scope so it was easier to aim?

2104
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:12,640
Okay.

2105
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,840
I remember that this is like as far as I played.

2106
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,300
We beat this level.

2107
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,060
And it was really tough.

2108
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:18,960
This one is tough.

2109
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,000
Give us a few tries.

2110
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:20,440
Oh.

So the laser made it easier.

2115
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:27,260
Damn it.

2116
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:32,540
Need to fill the car with gas.

2303
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:43,450
Oh.

2304
01:37:45,210 --> 01:37:48,170
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

2305
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:48,190
I got you, I got you.

2306
01:37:48,190 --> 01:37:50,530
Hold on, I'm taking care of these guys first.

2307
01:37:50,910 --> 01:37:52,190
Then I'll get you, I'll get you.

2308
01:37:53,170 --> 01:37:54,670
It looks like it's not even true.

2309
01:37:54,790 --> 01:37:55,690
Oh, there's fire.

2310
01:37:57,170 --> 01:37:58,950
Oh my god, I can't, I can't get you.

2311
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:01,070
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

2312
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:01,530
Oh my.

2313
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:03,710
I got you.

2314
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:04,290
I'm good.

2315
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:05,030
I'm good.

2316
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:06,530
I got you, I got you.

2317
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:07,710
Yeah, you.

2318
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:18,230
Okay, so the gas cans get blown up, you guys.

2319
01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:19,590
No way.

2320
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:21,810
I swear that's what just happened.

2321
01:38:22,090 --> 01:38:22,650
No way.

2322
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:25,010
And the gas cans got it.

2323
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:26,090
Wait, but where's...

2324
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:27,250
There's no more gas.

2325
01:38:27,790 --> 01:38:28,130
Nope.

2326
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:29,910
No, they all spawn back.

2327
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:30,730
They do?

2328
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:31,490
Oh, I see.

2329
01:38:31,570 --> 01:38:31,950
I see.

2330
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:33,050
They're back up there.

2331
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:34,170
Oh, my God.

2332
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:38,970
So the thing is, I'm pretty sure if you shoot the gas tanks,
they'll spawn fire, so don't shoot them.

2333
01:38:39,570 --> 01:38:40,510
Oh, my God.

I even knew I fucking had to.

2367
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:51,990

01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:52,530
Oh, there we go.

2369
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:52,950
It's okay.

2370
01:40:53,210 --> 01:40:53,530
Ow.

2371
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:54,470
It's okay.

2372
01:40:56,190 --> 01:40:58,370
How do we get the...

2373
01:40:59,110 --> 01:40:59,430
Oh, man.

2374
01:40:59,450 --> 01:41:01,650
Let's get that one on the floor there that they just
dropped.

2375
01:41:02,130 --> 01:41:02,190
Okay.

2376
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:04,330
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2377
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:04,790
Oh my god.

2378
01:41:04,910 --> 01:41:05,490
Oh my god.

2379
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:06,250
Charger!

2380
01:41:06,830 --> 01:41:07,330
Thank you, Henry.

2381
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:09,390
Yeah, fine, fine, fine.

2382
01:41:10,830 --> 01:41:11,190
Okay.

2383
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:17,630
This is the most frustrating one I saw.

2384
01:41:18,010 --> 01:41:18,070
I swear.

2385
01:41:18,450 --> 01:41:20,810
Let's get both of these and fill them in at the same time.

2386
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:22,330
Oh my God.

2387
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:23,290
I'm so sorry.

2388
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:24,150
I just blew it up.

2389
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:25,650
I did the same thing.

2390
01:41:25,730 --> 01:41:26,330
Don't even sweat it.

2391
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:26,750
Nice.

2392
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:29,050
I'll fill both of these pretty much at the same time.

2393
01:41:29,870 --> 01:41:31,030
I think we have to go this way.

2394
01:41:31,490 --> 01:41:31,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2395
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:32,670
I think so too.

2396
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:33,850
Oh, there we go.

2397
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:35,030
There you go.

2398
01:41:35,970 --> 01:41:37,450
Oh, my God.

2399
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:38,250
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle.

2400
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:39,630
Oh, I'm down.

2401
01:41:39,870 --> 01:41:40,150
Oh.

2402
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:41,170
Oh.

2403
01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:42,410
I'm coming.

2404
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:43,670
I'm kind of far though.

2405
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:47,910
It's okay if I die No, I'm coming up.

2406
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:49,010
Mitch shut up.

2407
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:49,370
I'll die.

2408
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:50,050
I'll die.

2409
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:55,670
You're supposed to haunt me forever you bitch I'm coming

2410

Oh fuck mint.

No, no, hold on.

2412
01:41:59,050 --> 01:41:59,490
Maybe I can't.

2413
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:06,310
I might be able to save you I don't think I can't get the
tongue.

2414
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:06,790
I can't get the tongue.

2415
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:09,290
I fell down.

2416
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:09,790
I fell down.

2417
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:10,350
I'm coming back.

2418

2421
01:42:41,190 --> 01:42:43,190
I'm reloading, I'm reloading.

2422
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:46,830
Oh my god, oh my gosh.

2423
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:50,930
Just go.

2424
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:58,000
But Dara, you're down!

2425
01:42:58,340 --> 01:42:58,340
Oh.

2426
01:42:58,880 --> 01:42:59,980
I am down.

2427
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:01,100
Oh no.

2428
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:04,740
Free life.

2429
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:08,080
Okay, I think...

2430
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:09,980
Strategy time.

2431
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:11,880
Fuck my ball!

2432
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:12,480
Yay!

2433
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:14,460
I think we should...

2434
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:21,460
So does it actually, can I ask our chat, does it actually
get harder the more gas you fill in?

2435
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:25,180
Yeah, every time you put the gas in, it makes it work.

2436
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:29,780
So that's why we got to gather all the gas and then put it
in at once.

2437
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:34,140
But if we, if even one of us shoots the gas, it's all going
to blow up.

2438
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:36,460
So I don't think it's a good idea.

2439
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:37,280
Here's an idea.

2440
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:43,360
What if we gather two and two and two and two everywhere,
like not at the car, but we drop all the gas on the bottom

2441
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:43,700
floor?

2442
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:47,380
So that way, even if we blow up a gas, we're only blowing up
two gases.

2443
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:49,780
We're not blowing up, like, a million gases.

2444
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:52,220
Do you know what I mean?

2445
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,680
Oh, like, leave them where you drop them.

2446
01:43:55,220 --> 01:44:00,960
Like, it's going to be two, two, two, two, two, two, two,
instead of, like, seven gases at the, you know?

2447
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:01,600
Yeah.

2448
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:04,360
You can just place them behind somewhere else if we don't
accidentally shoot them.

2449
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:09,100
Yeah, because the problem is if we shoot one gas by
accident, it's going to blow up all the gases that are.

2450
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:11,440
And people are saying the spitter can trigger it.

2451
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:17,220
And I also think we should be in teams of two, because if
one of us gets like attacked by a spitter or something the

2452
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:18,260
teammate can help.

2453
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:19,500
Okay.

2454
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Okay.

2455
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:24,620
Are we good with like keeping me and Mint, Henya, Haruka, or
do you guys want to change?

2456
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:26,100
I'm good.

2457
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:26,640
I'm good.

2458
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:27,460
Okay.

2459
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:28,820
I just want to kill things.

2460
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:29,300
I do.

2461
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:29,700
Okay.

2462
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:34,200
So if you kill things, then Henya, you grab the gas and
Haruka, you kill stuff to protect her.

2463
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:34,540
Okay.

2464
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:39,180
Someone said in my chat, like every fourth tank or so is a
tank.

2465
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,120
Or sorry, every fourth.

2466
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:41,960
Every fourth.

2467
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:44,400
So that means we should do five for four.

2468
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:55,500
544 because it's 13 total okay instead of getting 441 it's
gonna be harder we should do 544 hey hi is that okay i'm

2469
01:44:55,500 --> 01:45:03,620
confused i yeah we're killing yeah we're killing we're
killing here are we going the right way yeah wasn't it the

2470
01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:12,480
other way no no that's the right way okay it's down here i

2471
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:15,880
time Thank you, mom.

2472
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:16,600
Anya?

2473
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:17,940
Anya, are you okay, Tiger Boo?

2474
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,080
Sorry, I was fixing my mom.

2475
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:21,260
Your mom!

2476
01:45:27,170 --> 01:45:28,870
Oh, wait, I got you the wrong gun.

2477
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:30,650
Oh, you're at the safe house?

2478
01:45:30,810 --> 01:45:31,690
Sorry, mom, I can't have dinner.

2479
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:33,150
I'm currently trying to save the world.

2480
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:33,690
Hold on.

2481
01:45:34,430 --> 01:45:35,250
Oh, yeah, I got it.

2482
01:45:35,370 --> 01:45:37,090
Saving the what's left of humanity.

2483
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:38,630
Yeah, sorry, mom.

2484
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:40,010
I got to save what's left of humanity.

2485
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:41,250
You can have fun in your resort.

2486
01:45:41,310 --> 01:45:41,590
Hold on.

2487
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:44,510
Can you wait one second before getting into the elevator?

2488
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:45,310
I want to switch guns.

2489
01:45:46,570 --> 01:45:47,090
Hurry up.

2490
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:48,030
I want to get the AK.

2491
01:45:48,190 --> 01:45:49,730
You can't go in the elevator.

2492
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:50,950
You just can't press the button.

2493
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:53,430
They're all coming, though.

2494
01:45:53,530 --> 01:45:54,610
No lunch for today.

2495
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:55,030
I'm good.

2496
01:45:55,330 --> 01:45:55,670
Thank you.

2497
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:56,330
There they go.

2498
01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:57,210
Thanks, Mom.

2499
01:45:57,330 --> 01:45:57,650
I'm coming.

2500
01:45:57,790 --> 01:45:57,890
I'm coming.

2501
01:45:58,250 --> 01:45:58,870
Thanks, Mom.

2502
01:45:59,110 --> 01:45:59,890
Thank you, Mom.

2503
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:00,990
Here they come.

2504
01:46:00,990 --> 01:46:01,590
Here they come.

2505
01:46:02,090 --> 01:46:02,810
Maybe I need it.

2506
01:46:02,890 --> 01:46:06,930
Can you ask Mama Nia if there's any delicious Reese's that
she wants?

2507
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:07,930
I'll bring them for her.

2508
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:09,110
Oh, they're climbing.

2509
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:10,670
She likes ranch sauce.

2510
01:46:11,190 --> 01:46:11,610
Ranch?

2511
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:12,070
All right.

2512
01:46:12,090 --> 01:46:12,990
I can bring some ranch.

2513
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:15,530
Do you know her favorite brand?

2514
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:16,850
I like ranch, too.

2515
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:18,170
I'll ask her.

2516
01:46:18,190 --> 01:46:18,930
Thank you.

2517
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:19,590
Yeah, ask her.

2518
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:20,250
Really?

2519
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:21,110
Thank you.

2520
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:26,190
Could you ask your mom what is your favorite Japanese food
too so I can give it to you?

2521
01:46:28,510 --> 01:46:31,410
My mom likes those little like bird shaped ones.

2522
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:33,150
They're in the shape of a little bird.

2523
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:35,590
It's like a little marshmallow kind of like a bird.

2524
01:46:36,870 --> 01:46:38,050
Oh, look up to it.

2525
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:38,670
I'll show you.

2526
01:46:38,790 --> 01:46:39,290
I'll show you.

2527
01:46:39,550 --> 01:46:39,810
I'll show you.

2528
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:40,570
Oh my gosh.

2529
01:46:40,890 --> 01:46:43,010
Don't you know birds are drones for the government?

2530
01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:46,450
They aren't quite you.

2531
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:52,230
Actually, my Okasan likes Pan.

2532
01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:53,150
She likes bread.

2533
01:46:54,190 --> 01:46:55,690
Yeah, did she like Japanese bread?

2534
01:46:55,970 --> 01:46:57,390
All right, Amata, I'm following you!

2535
01:46:57,630 --> 01:46:58,390
Yeah, no, Mint.

2536
01:46:58,690 --> 01:46:59,430
Let's go get the...

2537
01:46:59,430 --> 01:46:59,570
Oh!

2538
01:46:59,770 --> 01:47:00,970
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2539
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:01,730
Oh, whoa!

2540
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:02,270
Oh, yeah!

2541
01:47:02,990 --> 01:47:03,810
We can put it...

2542
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:04,130
Yeah!

2543
01:47:04,630 --> 01:47:05,890
Let's put it behind the car.

2544
01:47:06,270 --> 01:47:07,350
Oh, Mint, Mint, behind me.

2545
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:07,770
Oh!

2546
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:10,090
Thank you, girl.

2547
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:12,150
Sorry if I shot you a little bit while that happened.

2548
01:47:12,150 --> 01:47:12,410
It's okay.

2549
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:13,310
Spitter?

2550
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:14,570
Oh!

2551
01:47:16,450 --> 01:47:17,950
Amata, I need you to come over!

2552
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:18,170
I have a better shot!

2553
01:47:18,190 --> 01:47:19,370
I'm here one second.

2554
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:20,430
I was getting attacked.

2555
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:20,690
All right.

2556
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:21,830
Should I shot you, man?

2557
01:47:22,490 --> 01:47:23,150
You can't go.

2558
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:24,410
Can I shot you many times today?

2559
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:25,590
Bring this health kit with you.

2560
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:26,410
Bring an XP with you.

2561
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:27,770
Okay, I'm bringing some gas.

2562
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:28,850
I think I already have one.

2563
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:29,470
I'm following you in.

2564
01:47:29,630 --> 01:47:30,530
Okay, then let's just go.

2565
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:32,110
It's going ice cream!

2566
01:47:34,090 --> 01:47:34,650
Here we go.

2567
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:35,410
Oh my gosh.

2568
01:47:35,410 --> 01:47:37,190
I never thought I want ice cream this much until now.

2569
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:38,130
I'm helping.

2570
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:38,570
I'm helping.

2571
01:47:38,770 --> 01:47:38,990
One second.

2572
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:40,010
I'm also...

2573
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:41,390
There's a horn on me too, girlie.

2574
01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:44,210
Oh my god.

2575
01:47:44,330 --> 01:47:44,990
Don't shoot over here.

2576
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:45,690
Don't shoot over here!

2577
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:46,390
They're fine.

2578
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:46,950
They're fine.

2579
01:47:48,190 --> 01:47:48,950
Oh, I found it!

2580
01:47:49,010 --> 01:47:49,810
I found it!

2581
01:47:49,870 --> 01:47:50,250
Okay.

2582
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:50,670
There's two.

2583
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:52,370
Okay.

2584
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:54,590
I think if we have five, we should load it.

2585
01:47:55,630 --> 01:47:56,350
Do we have five?

2586
01:47:57,170 --> 01:47:58,050
Uh, we have three.

2587
01:47:58,090 --> 01:47:58,610
We have three.

2588
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:01,970
Okay.

2589
01:48:02,230 --> 01:48:02,750
Hold on, Mint.

2590
01:48:03,090 --> 01:48:04,150
Okay, this one.

2591
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:05,090
Oh, one more.

2592
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:06,110
Let me grab it.

2593
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:06,990
Uh, my time!

2594
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:08,270
One second, Mint.

2595
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:08,730
I'm behind you.

2596
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:09,310
I got it!

2597
01:48:09,390 --> 01:48:09,990
I got it!

2598
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:10,710
I'm far behind you.

2599
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:12,030
Oh, you're far behind me.

2600
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:13,270
I think you took my pistol.

2601
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:14,370
Had you.

2602
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:15,950
Wait, I did?

2603
01:48:16,090 --> 01:48:16,950
I'm far behind you, Mint.

2604
01:48:16,970 --> 01:48:17,450
I think so.

2605
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:18,170
I'm upstairs.

2606
01:48:18,190 --> 01:48:18,870
I see it.

2607
01:48:19,190 --> 01:48:20,010
Yeah, throw these two down.

2608
01:48:20,210 --> 01:48:20,610
That's perfect.

2609
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:22,610
Good job, girl.

2610
01:48:22,630 --> 01:48:23,090
I don't have it.

2611
01:48:23,190 --> 01:48:23,850
I don't have it.

2612
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:25,610
I got the other one.

2613
01:48:25,670 --> 01:48:26,570
No, I just throw it down.

2614
01:48:26,830 --> 01:48:27,130
Throw it down.

2615
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:28,210
Wait, what did I just say?

2616
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:28,370
Perfect.

2617
01:48:28,490 --> 01:48:28,790
Good girl.

2618
01:48:30,190 --> 01:48:31,190
Let's bring these closer.

2619
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:34,330
I got my banana.

2620
01:48:34,450 --> 01:48:34,730
Don't worry.

2621
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:36,050
We can grab these two as well.

2622
01:48:36,130 --> 01:48:36,770
You got your banana?

2623
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:37,190
Nice.

2624
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:38,010
I don't know.

2625
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:41,310
We can't grab them without setting it on fire.

2626
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:41,710
We're done.

2627
01:48:42,710 --> 01:48:43,190
We're done.

2628
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:43,830
I'm far up.

2629
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:44,610
I'm far from you, Mint.

2630
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:45,570
All right, let's go.

2631
01:48:45,730 --> 01:48:46,270
I'm down still.

2632
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:46,930
I'm sorry.

2633
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:49,470
Why are you upstairs?

2634
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:50,930
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2635
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:52,050
Should I start loading them in?

2636
01:48:52,210 --> 01:48:52,390
Should I?

2637
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:53,410
I mean, there's already a horde.

2638
01:48:54,130 --> 01:48:54,210
I think you could.

2639
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:55,090
I think you...

2640
01:48:55,090 --> 01:48:57,250
Just be careful that we don't blow them up by accident.

2641
01:48:57,310 --> 01:48:58,530
I'm gonna load...

2642
01:48:58,770 --> 01:48:58,930
Oh!

2643
01:48:59,850 --> 01:48:59,990
Hey!

2644
01:49:00,610 --> 01:49:01,410
Back off, buddy!

2645
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:02,230
Buh-Buh-Buh!

2646
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:03,690
I gotta be careful not to wait.

2647
01:49:03,690 --> 01:49:04,990
How do I load it?

2648
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:05,310
Oh shit!

2649
01:49:05,450 --> 01:49:05,810
I need help!

2650
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:06,190
I need help!

2651
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:06,690
I need help!

2652
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:07,390
I'm coming!

2653
01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:07,950
I'm coming!

2654
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:12,210
Oh my god.

2655
01:49:13,870 --> 01:49:14,410
Oh, we're in trouble.

2656
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:15,390
We're in trouble!

2657
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:16,010
We're in trouble!

2658
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:16,390
We're in trouble!

2659
01:49:16,970 --> 01:49:18,050
Girls, girls, we need your help.

2660
01:49:19,610 --> 01:49:21,030
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2661
01:49:21,590 --> 01:49:21,970
Oh, my God.

2662
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:23,790
Oh, my God.

2663
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:25,110
Oh, there's a tank.

2664
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:25,670
We need your help.

2665
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:26,250
We need your help.

2666
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:26,370
I'm down.

2667
01:49:26,490 --> 01:49:27,030
Okay, okay.

2668
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:27,810
Okay, we're coming.

2669
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:28,690
We're done.

2670
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:29,490
Be careful.

2671
01:49:29,690 --> 01:49:31,070
Don't blow up the gas canisters.

2672
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:31,630
We got a ton.

2673
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:32,150
We're so.

2674
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:33,610
It's my Jover.

2675
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:35,630
It's fine.

2676
01:49:37,710 --> 01:49:38,590
It's up to you, Hanja.

2677
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:39,090
No!

2678
01:49:40,050 --> 01:49:41,790
Oh, you're doing so good.

2679
01:49:41,810 --> 01:49:43,110
I don't know about that.

2680
01:49:43,550 --> 01:49:46,050
I don't know about that.

2681
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:46,450
I don't know.

2682
01:49:46,450 --> 01:49:47,830
Can you pick me up quickly if you can?

2683
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:48,690
Okay.

2684
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:49,790
We'll come in.

2685
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:52,830
Mrs. Pop!

2686
01:49:53,410 --> 01:49:53,870
Mrs. Pop!

2687
01:49:54,690 --> 01:49:55,850
I need some help!

2688
01:49:57,670 --> 01:49:57,730
Hmm.

2689
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:02,070
Oh, for third fault damage!

2690
01:50:02,270 --> 01:50:02,530
Jump!

2691
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:03,470
Oh!

2692
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,300
I didn't want to throw the bomb.

2693
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:12,800
I was scared about.

2694
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:16,460
I thought we were doing so good this time around, though.

2695
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:18,660
I think it doesn't matter if you load them or not.

2696
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:19,580
The horde just comes.

2697
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:22,220
I think if you pick them, if you touch them, the horde
comes, right?

2698
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:22,900
Really?

2699
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:23,500
I don't know.

2700
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:25,140
That's crazy.

2701
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:29,400
So if you guys won, what Hedy and I have been doing, we've
been putting the gas behind the car.

2702
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:30,620
Yeah, that's what we did.

2703
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:31,740
That's what we were doing.

2704
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:35,440
But then I tried loading it, and then the tank came out.

2705
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:37,620
Well, shit.

2706
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:38,940
Let's try it again.

2707
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:41,300
I think we had a good vibe over here.

2708
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:42,320
I think we had a good vibe.

2709
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:48,060
I think maybe what we should do, when we're closer to
loading a bunch of them in, let's all stick together at the

2710
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:48,640
end.

2711
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2712
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:51,580
For real, for real.

2713
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:53,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2714
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:57,120
I don't know if they actually heard me.

2715
01:50:58,140 --> 01:50:58,900
I don't know if they actually heard me.

2716
01:50:58,900 --> 01:50:59,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2717
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,800
Sorry guys, I have a cold.

2718
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:05,940
Do you think they heard me or do you think they're just...

2719
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:08,260
I guess we find out.

2720
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:10,340
Sorry, Hanyu, let me wipe my nose.

2721
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:11,680
Alright, I'm good.

2722
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:13,120
What's going on?

2723
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:14,620
What is happening?

2724
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:16,260
Nice one, nice one.

2725
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:17,400
Nice one.

2726
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:19,920
I was wiping my nose because I clearly sneezed.

2727
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:21,520
Yeah, I think they were freezing it.

2728
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:27,080
Let's go.

2729
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:27,960
How do we start this?

2730
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:29,640
Well, if you're looking for ideas.

2731
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:31,680
So, my gosh, I have a joke for you.

2732
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:32,220
Room stairs.

2733
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:33,500
I have a joke.

2734
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,400
Why did the chicken cross the road?

2735
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:38,220
Oh, why?

2736
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:40,460
To get to the other side.

2737
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,720
Oh, that's a good one.

2738
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:46,980
Oh, sorry.

2739
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:49,820
My feelings.

2740
01:52:00,210 --> 01:52:01,030
There she is.

2741
01:52:01,070 --> 01:52:01,710
Just pour it in.

2742
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:02,670
Just pour it in.

2743
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:04,170
Wait, that's not mint.

2744
01:52:04,270 --> 01:52:04,590
That's Hania.

2745
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:05,110
Mint, mint, mint.

2746
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:05,750
Let's go together.

2747
01:52:06,190 --> 01:52:08,810
Oh, I guess let's protect Hania for like two seconds because
she's alone.

2748
01:52:09,030 --> 01:52:09,250
Yeah.

2749
01:52:09,650 --> 01:52:10,650
Oh, thank you, thank you.

2750
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:11,210
I got the bullet.

2751
01:52:11,210 --> 01:52:12,010
Good job, Billy.

2752
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:12,550
Another gas.

2753
01:52:13,390 --> 01:52:14,490
I'm pouring in a gas.

2754
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:15,690
Right behind it.

2755
01:52:16,070 --> 01:52:16,690
Alright, Henry.

2756
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:18,350
I'm ready.

2757
01:52:18,510 --> 01:52:20,030
I got you.

2758
01:52:20,030 --> 01:52:20,330
I got you.

2759
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:21,210
I got you.

2760
01:52:21,830 --> 01:52:22,130
Don't get it.

2761
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:22,810
There we go.

2762
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:23,830
Oh, guys.

2763
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:24,270
I need help.

2764
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:24,670
I need help.

2765
01:52:25,110 --> 01:52:25,430
I need help.

2766
01:52:25,670 --> 01:52:26,330
I think I got...

2767
01:52:26,330 --> 01:52:26,970
Oh, my God.

2768
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:27,490
Leave me alone.

2769
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:28,530

Be prepared.

01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:05,610
I'm going upstairs, Matara.

01:53:06,090 --> 01:53:06,670
Okay, I'm following you.

Me into the left, mid, mid, mid, right.

Oh, no, never mind.

I'm so stupid.

2785
01:53:15,570 --> 01:53:16,310
Never mind, never mind, never mind.

2786
01:53:16,570 --> 01:53:17,010
I'm so stupid.

2787
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:17,890
Left here.

2788
01:53:18,010 --> 01:53:18,670
Left here.

Yeah, other left.

01:53:22,090 --> 01:53:23,090
All right, then.

2792
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:23,630
Let's go down.

2793
01:53:24,210 --> 01:53:24,690
Should we go down?

2794
01:53:24,730 --> 01:53:25,770
Should we go down in the middle stair?

2795
01:53:25,990 --> 01:53:27,330
Uh, are they coming through here?

2796
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:27,990
Yeah, yeah.

2797
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:30,810
Oh, fuck.

2798
01:53:31,590 --> 01:53:32,050
I got one.

2799
01:53:32,190 --> 01:53:32,630
I got one.

2800
01:53:35,970 --> 01:53:36,850
I'm sorry!

2801
01:53:37,570 --> 01:53:38,270
Was it you?

2802
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:38,890
I thought it was me.

2803
01:53:39,070 --> 01:53:39,790
It was me.

2804
01:53:40,830 --> 01:53:41,230
I'm sorry.

2805
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:45,850
Oh, um, it was all you.

2806
01:53:46,930 --> 01:53:47,630
It was all you.

2807
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:48,670
It was just a dream.

2808
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:52,470
I think we can go up for you.

2809
01:53:53,090 --> 01:53:54,090
It was all you.

2810
01:53:54,930 --> 01:53:56,930
I'm just putting the gas tank behind the carpet.

2811
01:53:57,310 --> 01:53:58,190
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2812
01:53:58,730 --> 01:53:59,930
Maybe we should do that.

2813
01:54:00,130 --> 01:54:01,530
Oh, well, well, well, panel.

2814
01:54:01,650 --> 01:54:02,550
It's just you and me, buddy.

2815
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:02,870
What?

2816
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:04,970
Well, it's caught on fire!

2817
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:06,030
Okay, okay.

2818
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:08,470
I remember the day.

2819
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:09,310
Oh, wait, how do we get over there?

2820
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:11,330
It took my life from me.

2821
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:13,050
Oh, it's time to end it, panel.

2822
01:54:13,410 --> 01:54:13,550
What is he?

2823
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:17,830
Wait, you can go, go, go, shoot, shoot, shoot.

2824
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:18,430
Okay.

2825
01:54:18,570 --> 01:54:19,010
Let's go.

2826
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:21,770
And your girls, there are the narwhal.

2827
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:24,290
There you go.

2828
01:54:24,330 --> 01:54:24,590
Oh, no.

2829
01:54:24,630 --> 01:54:25,070
Oh, no.

2830
01:54:25,070 --> 01:54:25,310
Oh, no.

2831
01:54:25,570 --> 01:54:25,930
Oh, no.

2832
01:54:28,850 --> 01:54:30,530
Oh, help me, please!

2833
01:54:30,810 --> 01:54:30,870
Someone!

2834
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:31,930
Oh gosh, over.

2835
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:33,230
Could you please go up?

2836
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:34,950
I fell off the stairs.

2837
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:35,850
Go up, go up the stairs.

2838
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:36,790
Go up, go up the stairs.

2839
01:54:37,330 --> 01:54:38,770
Oh, I see you, I see you, I see you.

2840
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:40,570
I didn't realize that was a big...

2841
01:54:41,050 --> 01:54:41,930
What happened to you?

2842
01:54:42,190 --> 01:54:42,710
What did you do?

2843
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:44,670
Don't ask, don't ask, don't ask, don't ask, don't ask.

2844
01:54:44,850 --> 01:54:45,530
You don't need to know.

2845
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:46,010
Okay.

2846
01:54:46,870 --> 01:54:49,230
I think we should load the current gas into the car.

2847
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:52,670
I think we should load the current gas into the car, y'all.

2848
01:54:52,890 --> 01:54:53,150
I think...

2849
01:54:53,150 --> 01:54:53,890
Wait, wait, there's a tank!

2850
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:55,370
There's a tank!

2851
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:58,430
After the tank is dead, I think we should load the current
gas.

2852
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:01,270
There's a bunch of ammo downstairs.

2853
01:55:01,390 --> 01:55:02,150
Yeah, I know.

2854
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:03,710
I gotta go get there.

2855
01:55:03,710 --> 01:55:05,370
I ain't going down without a fucking piece of shit.

2856
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:08,070

01:55:22,930 --> 01:55:24,570

You sure?

2889
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:21,170

2890
01:56:21,390 --> 01:56:22,190
Okay, okay, do it.

2891
01:56:22,250 --> 01:56:23,950
Oh, you need to use this bile head at some point.

Oh, yeah.

2893
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:26,150

Wait, how do we get the gas?

2901
01:56:33,190 --> 01:56:33,750
We have four more gases.

2902
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:34,430
I think we need them.

2903
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:36,670
We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna blow up these gases.

2904
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:37,250
I know we are.

2905
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:38,250
No, no, no, we won't.

2906
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:38,790
We won't, we won't.

2907
01:56:38,810 --> 01:56:39,090
We won't.

2908
01:56:39,130 --> 01:56:39,390
Don't worry.

2909
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:41,310
Okay, I'm gonna put it in the car.

2910
01:56:41,710 --> 01:56:43,110
Oh, get out of my way.

01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:47,450

You're fine.

2917
01:56:48,830 --> 01:56:49,590
Don't even sweat it.

2918
01:56:49,590 --> 01:56:49,890
Okay.

2919
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:51,590
What was that?

2920
01:56:51,850 --> 01:56:52,970
Oh shit guys, guys, I need your help.

2921
01:56:53,110 --> 01:56:54,810
I need your help, I need your help, I need your help.

01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:56,610

01:56:57,750 --> 01:56:59,350
I saw you flying away!

2925
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:01,990
Yeah, I got crawled by the guy.

01:57:04,030 --> 01:57:06,190
Oh, did the gas tank up top up here?

2927
01:57:07,590 --> 01:57:08,770
Oh, I'm loading.

2928
01:57:09,150 --> 01:57:09,570
How do we get that?

2929
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:11,850
Oh no, her- oh god, Woody, hello?

2930
01:57:11,890 --> 01:57:12,590
How do we get that?

2931

How the fuck do we- It's okay.

We only got, after this, we only need four more guys.

2933
01:57:17,370 --> 01:57:18,970
We're like, pretty much almost done.

01:57:21,590 --> 01:57:22,470
Let's stick together.

2935
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:23,910
Let's stick together, gamer girls.

2936
01:57:25,550 --> 01:57:26,850
Do not blow up the gas tank.

2937
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:27,990
What gas tank?

2938
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:28,430
Where is...

2939
01:57:28,430 --> 01:57:29,030
Oh, I see it.

2940
01:57:29,030 --> 01:57:29,490
I'm going to get it.

2941
01:57:29,810 --> 01:57:30,330
I'm going to load it.

2942
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:30,810
I'm going to load it.

2943
01:57:31,230 --> 01:57:31,870
Good job, honey.

2944
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:32,590
Good job, Haru.

2945
01:57:33,930 --> 01:57:34,610
Oh, I'm the smoke.

All right, I'm going to stay up here.

I think I have...

2951
01:57:46,970 --> 01:57:48,110
Yeah, I'm going to have to get caught too.

2952
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:49,350
Where's all the gas?

2953
01:57:50,430 --> 01:57:50,950
It's on the switch.

2954
01:57:50,970 --> 01:57:51,490
Okay, mint.

2955
01:57:52,030 --> 01:57:52,290
Yeah.

2956
01:57:52,690 --> 01:57:53,930
I think it gets exploded.

2957
01:57:54,790 --> 01:57:55,290
Uh oh.

2958
01:57:55,330 --> 01:57:57,550
Here comes Metal Gear Ray.

2959
01:57:57,650 --> 01:57:58,410
I see two of them.

2960
01:57:58,830 --> 01:57:59,170
Right here.

2961
01:57:59,190 --> 01:58:00,070
Mate, let's follow Hania.

01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:01,710
Right here.

2964
01:58:01,810 --> 01:58:02,030
Right here.

2965
01:58:02,150 --> 01:58:02,730
Okay, I'm coming.

2966
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:04,170
Oh wait, I gotta heal.

2967
01:58:04,570 --> 01:58:05,390
I'm gonna heal.

2968
01:58:06,170 --> 01:58:08,590
If you'll cover for me, Mata, I'm gonna heal real quick.

2969
01:58:08,650 --> 01:58:08,990
You'll heal.

2970
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:10,190
Oh, wait, wait.

2971
01:58:10,610 --> 01:58:11,350
Hania, you're alone.

2972
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:11,850
Be careful.

2973
01:58:12,750 --> 01:58:12,970
Okay.

2974
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:13,810
Okay, I'm coming.

2975
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:14,290
We're coming.

2976
01:58:14,630 --> 01:58:16,170
Well, for Haruka, are you doing the tag?

2977
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:17,530
This way, this way, this way, this way.

2978
01:58:17,650 --> 01:58:17,970
Which way?

2979
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:18,970
Oh, let's help Haru.

2980
01:58:19,330 --> 01:58:20,270
I'm gonna kill this tag.

2981
01:58:20,270 --> 01:58:20,730
Let's help Haru.

2982
01:58:20,830 --> 01:58:21,330
Let's help Haru.

2983
01:58:21,970 --> 01:58:23,030
I'm gonna kill him.

2984
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:24,910
Solo the tag!

2985
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:26,590
Solo the tag!

2986
01:58:26,590 --> 01:58:28,010
Solo the tag!

2987
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:30,070
Let me solo the tag!

2988
01:58:33,330 --> 01:58:34,250
Oh, um...

01:58:34,250 --> 01:58:38,740
Oh my godubs!

2990
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:39,500
OUCHI!

2991
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:40,520
OUCHI, OCHI, OCHI.

01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,180
OUCHI, OCHI.

2993
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:43,740
OUCHI.

2994
01:58:43,740 --> 01:58:45,240
Oh fuck, I didn't realize he was a big guy.

2995
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:46,160
I thought he was dead.

2996
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:47,900
Is he dead?

2997
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:49,040
He's dead!

2998
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:50,120
HEe he!

2999
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:51,200
Oh my gosh.

3000
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:52,200
You got her?

3001
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:53,280
Oh, I got you.

3002
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:54,180
I got her, I got her, I got you.

3003
01:58:54,180 --> 01:58:54,620
I got you?

3004
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:58,880
Tanya, take the drugs for help.

3005
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:01,420
Wait, she's not up yet!

3006
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:02,520
I'm not up yet!

3007
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:06,100
Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

3008
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:07,420
Guys, we only need three more.

3009
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:07,680
Oh, sorry.

3010
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:08,920
How about we all go together?

3011
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:11,140
We can try.

3012
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:13,180
Let's go all together.

3013
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:14,320
Where is it?

3014
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:16,220
There's two over there in the back.

3015
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:18,460
Oh, how do we get up there?

3016
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:20,240
I think over here, no?

3017
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:21,920
Wait, wait, somebody's alone.

3018
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:23,320
There's Haru, Haru.

3019
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:24,140
Yeah, where Haru is.

3020
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:24,660
Where Haru is?

3021
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:25,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry.

3022
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,260
From how do we can go there?

3023
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:28,000
Okay, perfect.

3024
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:34,180
I think now if we stayed together and used drugs for health,
I think we might get it.

3025
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:36,280
I think it's this way, this way, this way.

3026
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:37,140
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3027
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:37,940
I think we have to go...

3028
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:38,360
Oh, this way?

3029
01:59:38,420 --> 01:59:39,080
This way, this way.

3030
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:39,840
Yeah, yeah, this way.

3031
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:40,420
Follow where Henye is?

3032
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:41,520
They're coming from the stairs behind.

3033
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:43,500
Oh, goodness Christ.

3034
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:45,020
Spooked me.

3035
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:48,100
I'm kind of slow, so I'll guard from the back.

3036
01:59:48,340 --> 01:59:49,080
I'm sticking back with Mint.

3037
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:49,840
I'm sticking back with Mint.

3038
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:51,120
I'm a little slow.

3039
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:52,280
It's okay, baby.

3040
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:53,200
Guys, there were two packs over.

3041
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:53,760
Not two packs.

3042
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:54,400
Yeah, yeah, we're coming.

3043
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,120
coming.

3044
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:56,680
Okay, okay.

3045
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:59,180
I'll grab, I'll grab one of them.

3046
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:01,760
Yeah, since Mint is slow.

3047
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:04,280
Or, I got it, I got it.

3048
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:06,360
Guys, there's pills here if anybody needs.

3049
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:08,980
There's a gas.

3050
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:13,190
I got you.

3051
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:15,550
Henya, I'm gonna give you pills.

3052
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:17,530
Thank you.

3053
02:00:18,370 --> 02:00:18,850
No, no, no.

3054
02:00:18,850 --> 02:00:20,590
Oh my god, Henya, wait, stop for a second.

3055
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:21,310
Okay.

3056
02:00:21,830 --> 02:00:23,230
I'm gonna die, but that's okay.

3057
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:24,290
Oh, I need help.

3058
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:25,010
Henya, behind you.

3059
02:00:25,170 --> 02:00:25,430
Behind you.

3060
02:00:26,070 --> 02:00:26,890
Thank you.

3061
02:00:27,070 --> 02:00:29,070
How do you Oh my god, I was so close to...

3062
02:00:29,070 --> 02:00:29,610
Did I finish?

3063
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:30,430
I don't even know.

3064
02:00:30,510 --> 02:00:30,710
No!

3065
02:00:31,130 --> 02:00:31,490
No!

3066
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:32,630
I was so close!

3067
02:00:33,250 --> 02:00:35,670
Mint, if you need to ask, then you didn't finish.

3068
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:37,010
That's true.

3069
02:00:39,410 --> 02:00:40,690
There's a smoker, by the way!

3070
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:41,270
Be careful!

3071
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:43,470
Guys, I'm running down to get mint.

3072
02:00:43,590 --> 02:00:45,270
I'm trying my best, but I am alone.

3073
02:00:45,770 --> 02:00:46,410
Oh, sorry, that's you.

3074
02:00:46,530 --> 02:00:47,130
Oh, fuck, I got some!

3075
02:00:47,610 --> 02:00:48,110
I got some!

3076
02:00:49,070 --> 02:00:49,790
Ice cream!

3077
02:00:50,090 --> 02:00:51,510
Ice cream coming in!

3078
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:54,410
Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out!

3079
02:00:54,530 --> 02:00:55,970
I can't get them from behind you!

3080
02:00:58,630 --> 02:00:59,510
Be careful.

3081
02:00:59,730 --> 02:01:00,390
Don't shoot the barrel.

3082
02:01:00,610 --> 02:01:00,730
I know.

3083
02:01:01,010 --> 02:01:01,790
I'm putting it in.

3084
02:01:01,950 --> 02:01:02,610
I don't care if I die.

3085
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:03,670
I got it.

3086
02:01:03,690 --> 02:01:04,050
Mint, mint.

3087
02:01:04,450 --> 02:01:05,290
You can give you pills.

3088
02:01:05,490 --> 02:01:06,210
You can give you drugs.

3089
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:07,270
I'm stuck.

3090
02:01:07,450 --> 02:01:08,350
I'm down again.

3091
02:01:08,430 --> 02:01:08,870
It's okay though.

3092
02:01:10,410 --> 02:01:11,870
Oh my gosh.

3093
02:01:12,150 --> 02:01:13,090
What a freak.

3094
02:01:13,210 --> 02:01:15,590
I was getting tea bagged for real.

3095
02:01:16,650 --> 02:01:17,270
Stop it.

3096
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:19,950
It's okay.

3097
02:01:20,050 --> 02:01:20,810
We're so close.

3098
02:01:20,910 --> 02:01:21,550
There's one more.

3099
02:01:21,770 --> 02:01:22,450
Just get it.

3100
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:23,770
Don't even worry about me.

3101
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:24,750
Just put it in.

3102
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:27,030
We need your extra firepower, you bitch.

3103
02:01:29,710 --> 02:01:30,510
I'm behind you.

3104
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:31,010
I'm behind you.

3105
02:01:31,110 --> 02:01:31,670
Let's get the last one.

3106
02:01:31,770 --> 02:01:32,430
There's one more.

3107
02:01:33,170 --> 02:01:33,350
Yeah.

3108
02:01:33,510 --> 02:01:34,050
Let's get one more.

3109
02:01:34,170 --> 02:01:34,550
Come on, girls.

3110
02:01:34,730 --> 02:01:35,090
Oh my god.

3111
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:35,930
We're about to win.

3112
02:01:36,670 --> 02:01:37,730
We're about to win the game.

3113
02:01:38,110 --> 02:01:39,990
Oh, big guy.

3114
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:40,390
The guy.

3115
02:01:40,390 --> 02:01:40,530
The guy.

3116
02:01:40,870 --> 02:01:41,990
The big guy.

3117
02:01:42,150 --> 02:01:45,490
Oh, my god.

3118
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:46,870
He's going upstairs.

3119
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:49,630
Fuck.

3120
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:51,210
I thought that would avoid the shot.

3121
02:01:51,710 --> 02:01:52,630
We're going the wrong way.

3122
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:55,150
Wow.

3123
02:01:55,150 --> 02:01:55,890
Is there one more?

3124
02:01:56,030 --> 02:01:56,150
Oh, no.

3125
02:01:57,330 --> 02:01:57,850
Jockey!

3126
02:02:05,570 --> 02:02:07,090
Where's the... where's the...

3127
02:02:07,690 --> 02:02:08,390
Where's Ray?

3128
02:02:10,490 --> 02:02:12,990
I have a... I have a bomb!

3129
02:02:13,570 --> 02:02:15,090
I'm not afraid to use it!

3130
02:02:16,810 --> 02:02:17,010
Hanyu!

3131
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:17,690
Hanyu, I'm coming!

3132
02:02:22,770 --> 02:02:24,330
I'm a little slow though.

3133
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:25,590
Thank you, thank you!

3134
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:27,650
Hanyu!

3135
02:02:28,230 --> 02:02:28,630
Hanyu!

3136
02:02:28,910 --> 02:02:29,370
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3137
02:02:29,650 --> 02:02:30,390
Oh my gosh.

3138
02:02:30,690 --> 02:02:31,670
No, it's okay, it's okay.

3139
02:02:34,390 --> 02:02:36,670
Hanyu, I... I... I don't think I can...

3140
02:02:36,670 --> 02:02:37,710
Hanyu, I'm down to you.

3141
02:02:38,170 --> 02:02:39,110
Oh, it's fine.

3142
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:39,570

3146
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:11,390
Oh, but I can't get behind you.

3147
02:03:12,510 --> 02:03:14,670
Okay, let's see where's it going.

3148
02:03:14,670 --> 02:03:15,410
Ah, Haru is shooting me.

3149
02:03:15,910 --> 02:03:16,910
I had a bomb!

3150
02:03:17,550 --> 02:03:19,070
I had a bomb if you need it.

3151
02:03:19,130 --> 02:03:20,750
You could grab it from my dead body.

3152
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:22,010
Peel it from my hands.

3153
02:03:22,350 --> 02:03:25,330
I don't know where Haru is.

3154
02:03:25,450 --> 02:03:26,450
Okay, she's behind me.

3155
02:03:27,550 --> 02:03:30,010
Okay, Haru, how are we doing this?

3156
02:03:31,390 --> 02:03:32,430
We gotta get up there.

3157
02:03:34,190 --> 02:03:34,650
Oh, watch out.

3158
02:03:35,150 --> 02:03:36,690
I don't think you can go from there.

3159
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:37,130
Fuck shit.

3160
02:03:38,590 --> 02:03:39,850
Oh my god.

3161
02:03:39,910 --> 02:03:40,710
She's cornered.

3162
02:03:40,850 --> 02:03:41,450
She's cornered.

3163
02:03:43,570 --> 02:03:44,550
She's not cornered.

3164
02:03:44,890 --> 02:03:47,050
You have to go first floor and get the other stairs.

3165
02:03:47,310 --> 02:03:48,750
I think it is on her.

3166
02:03:48,930 --> 02:03:49,690
Is that a jockey?

3167
02:03:49,970 --> 02:03:50,550
Oh no.

3168
02:03:51,850 --> 02:03:52,030
Oh.

3169
02:03:52,570 --> 02:03:53,050
Haru.

3170
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:54,090
Good luck.

3171
02:03:57,780 --> 02:03:58,460
She's so strong.

3172
02:03:58,460 --> 02:03:59,560
I think you're about to do it.

3173
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:02,020
I genuinely think next round is the round, girl.

3174
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:03,200
Wait, what do you mean next round?

3175
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:04,500
We're still...

3176
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:05,420
We still have here.

3177
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:06,840
Oh gosh.

3178
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:08,040
We just got...

3179
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:08,280
Uh-oh.

3180
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:09,240
The ice cream.

3181
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:24,020
Haru with the pistol my queen I genuinely think like we're
about to get we can take like a two minute break re-center P

3189
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:14,920
Okay, two minute breather for you.

3190
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:16,360
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

3191
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:19,380
I just need like two minutes, because that was really
overwhelming.

3192
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:21,380
This stage is so stinky.

3193
02:05:22,580 --> 02:05:23,300
But it was fun.

3194
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:24,480
I think we're just about to get it.

3195
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:25,540
Genuinely.

3196
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:31,080

everything down in like two big waves, having teammates,

3197
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:32,820

3198
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:35,980

02:06:41,630 --> 02:06:43,430
In Twitch, you just type in and then it shows up.

3209
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:44,170
No, in this game.

3210
02:06:44,370 --> 02:06:45,050
In this game.

3212
02:06:46,490 --> 02:06:47,050

You suck.

3217
02:06:54,290 --> 02:06:56,930
There's still a med pack here if anyone wants it.

3218
02:06:57,570 --> 02:07:00,330
I think somebody with low health should use it and then
grab... Oh, wait.

3219
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:01,610
I didn't have an extra med pack.

3220
02:07:01,730 --> 02:07:02,030
Not bad.

3221
02:07:02,390 --> 02:07:02,750
I'm stupid.

3222
02:07:02,750 --> 02:07:04,150
Oh, I have an extra.

3223
02:07:04,630 --> 02:07:06,890
No, we all have one med pack, right?

3224
02:07:07,070 --> 02:07:07,650
Oh, okay.

3225
02:07:07,790 --> 02:07:08,010

02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:11,710
I didn't have it.

3229
02:07:11,970 --> 02:07:12,590
Does that feel good?

3230
02:07:12,690 --> 02:07:13,470
I don't have one.

3231
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:14,130
Oh, it's not emo.

3232
02:07:14,130 --> 02:07:14,950
Grab the one downstairs, though.

3233
02:07:15,090 --> 02:07:16,090

3234
02:07:16,930 --> 02:07:17,410

3238
02:07:20,250 --> 02:07:22,790
Girls, I need you all together.

3239
02:07:23,870 --> 02:07:24,670
Envision the win.

3240
02:07:25,270 --> 02:07:26,730
Be like professional athletes.

3241
02:07:27,310 --> 02:07:29,870
Imagine putting in the 13th Gascat and cheering.

3242
02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:30,490
Hoorah.

3243
02:07:31,350 --> 02:07:31,710

02:07:35,150 --> 02:07:35,750
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3249
02:07:35,750 --> 02:07:36,710
Are you manifesting?

3250
02:07:37,490 --> 02:07:38,450
I'm manifesting.

3251
02:07:44,150 --> 02:07:46,870
You have to be happy as if we just won.

3252
02:07:49,170 --> 02:07:49,550
Tanya, please.

3253
02:07:49,650 --> 02:07:51,410
Not the Garfield scratch.

3254
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:57,970
Listen, the clutch that I made and then you have to jinx it
for me.

3255
02:07:58,030 --> 02:07:59,570
Sorry, I was sneezing.

3256
02:07:59,930 --> 02:08:04,030
Tanya, can you just pretend to be so happy that we won?

3257
02:08:04,970 --> 02:08:06,130
Just imagine we win.

3258
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:07,930
Yay!

3259
02:08:08,670 --> 02:08:09,510

All right, let's go.

Don't you have to be like...

3266
02:08:19,230 --> 02:08:22,330
If we lose, it's because Henya's power of imagination.

3267
02:08:22,730 --> 02:08:25,430
You do not blame Henya for your own skill issue?

3269
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:28,150

I sigh on the scoreboard Hanyo.

3284

02:09:44,890 --> 02:09:46,390
Keep the two on the floor at the end.

Hold on, let me get the pills.

3324
02:10:33,030 --> 02:10:35,810
There's always pills upstairs, Mint, if you want some for
the extra help.

3325
02:10:36,410 --> 02:10:37,370
Did you grab both of them?

3326
02:10:37,950 --> 02:10:39,910
No, there's another pill there if you want to grab it.

3327
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:40,570
Nice.

3328
02:10:40,950 --> 02:10:41,450
An adrenaline.

02:10:41,770 --> 02:10:42,490
Oh, I'll try.

3330
02:10:42,690 --> 02:10:44,090

3535
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:45,740
The people again.

3536
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:46,360
Oh, the end of May?

3537
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:47,360
Yeah.

3538
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:48,880
Arigato.

3539
02:19:49,740 --> 02:19:51,620
Do we keep going or do we stop here?

3540
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:52,600
Up to you guys.

3541
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:53,120
It's up to you.

3542
02:19:53,220 --> 02:19:54,480
What's in your...

3543
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:55,540
I feel like I can keep going.

3544
02:19:56,360 --> 02:19:57,520
So, yeah, up to you guys.

3545
02:19:57,780 --> 02:19:59,600
Yeah, I could stop or I could go.

3546
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:02,500
I think it's, you know, if anybody's too tired.

3547
02:20:03,580 --> 02:20:06,500
Is the first mission the hardest?

3548
02:20:08,360 --> 02:20:08,560
No.

3549
02:20:09,860 --> 02:20:12,260
Does it get easier?

3550
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:13,820
No.

3551
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:17,600
We could also choose like anyone.

3552
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:19,360
We don't have to do like the second one.

3553
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:20,240
We can choose any.

3554
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:24,460
The second one says streets.

3555
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:26,700
Like the carnival one.

3556
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:28,400
Well, the carnival one's kind of annoying too.

3557
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:30,520
Oh, it's because I have the campaign.

3558
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:31,860
Death sender passing.

02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:33,760

3561
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:37,420
Blood harvest?

3562
02:20:38,460 --> 02:20:38,800

Why are people saying the carnival's hardest?

3572
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:27,720
Maybe I just saw one person.

3573
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:28,980

Oh, there's no mercy then.

3578
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:35,840

3579
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:36,820

02:21:36,820 --> 02:21:38,040
Don't most hear a dark carnival.

3581
02:21:39,980 --> 02:21:40,860
Oh, oh.

3582
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:43,600
I don't think no mercy in the carnival is a good one.

3583
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:45,260
Yeah, that's what I'm seeing too.

3584
02:21:47,220 --> 02:21:49,480
I've never, I don't think I've done no mercy.

3585
02:21:49,900 --> 02:21:50,480
I don't know though.

3586
02:21:51,900 --> 02:21:52,620

I'm going to need a drink after this game, I think.

3602
02:22:52,220 --> 02:22:57,820
I didn't think we'd be playing as the Left 4 Dead 1 people,
so I didn't download any of their mod.

3603
02:22:58,460 --> 02:23:01,080
The Left 4 Dead 1 guy, I thought he was from Dead by
Daylight.

3604
02:23:01,340 --> 02:23:02,740
I didn't realize he was from this game.

3605
02:23:02,860 --> 02:23:03,220
Which one?

3606
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:03,860
The one with the hat?

3607
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:04,720

3611
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:08,540
He's in Dead by Daylight.

3612
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:09,340
Dead by Daylight?

3613
02:23:09,340 --> 02:23:10,200
I think his name is Bill.

3614
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:10,800
Yeah.

3615
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:11,340
I think so.

3616
02:23:11,380 --> 02:23:11,890

02:23:12,420 --> 02:23:12,820
Really?

3618
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:14,300

02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:13,380

Do we go down?

3642
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:20,420
How do we go behind you?

3643
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:21,840
I think we go down, sir.

3644
02:24:22,060 --> 02:24:23,480

Oh.

3646
02:24:26,420 --> 02:24:27,640
There's a half-life VR.

3647
02:24:27,800 --> 02:24:28,820
I don't know if you saw him yet.

3648
02:24:29,820 --> 02:24:31,520
Oh, yeah, but I get motion sickness.

3649
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:32,160
That's hard.

3650
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:34,140
I wish I could.

3651
02:24:34,340 --> 02:24:35,060
I wish I could.

3652
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:35,860

3656
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:40,300
What's the best gun?

Right.

3667
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:56,320
What is it?

3668
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:57,100
Oh, my goodness.

3669
02:24:57,260 --> 02:24:58,320
Those people are alive.

3670
02:24:59,120 --> 02:24:59,840
I mean, they're dead.

3671
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:00,740
Nope, not anymore.

I just don't stop coming.

3676
02:25:17,430 --> 02:25:19,910
And they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming.

3677
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:23,770
Should we go downstairs?

3678
02:25:24,450 --> 02:25:24,870
Sure.

3679
02:25:25,170 --> 02:25:26,430
Well, I went downstairs.

3680
02:25:27,150 --> 02:25:29,170

3681
02:25:29,370 --> 02:25:30,290
Oh, oh, no.

3682
02:25:30,690 --> 02:25:31,350
Oh my God.

3683

Ow.

3684
02:25:32,950 --> 02:25:33,130
Ow.

3685
02:25:33,630 --> 02:25:34,870
Did we get him?

3686
02:25:35,010 --> 02:25:36,670
How the heck am I already yellow?

3687
02:25:37,190 --> 02:25:38,250
Oh no, Hanya.

3688
02:25:38,490 --> 02:25:39,290
Oh no.

3689
02:25:39,730 --> 02:25:41,590
Use your health pack.

3690
02:25:41,590 --> 02:25:42,110
Hey!

3691
02:25:42,990 --> 02:25:46,830
They don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they
don't stop coming.

3692
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:50,970
I have a Molotov in case there's a big gang.

3693
02:25:50,990 --> 02:25:51,290
Ow!

3694
02:25:52,450 --> 02:25:54,430
Sorry, I was shooting the other guy!

3695
02:25:55,250 --> 02:25:56,590
I'm so...

3696
02:25:57,590 --> 02:25:57,850
Ow!

3697
02:25:58,450 --> 02:25:59,710
The guy jumpy, jumpy, jumpy!

3698
02:26:00,310 --> 02:26:00,750
Pecota!

3699
02:26:02,570 --> 02:26:03,090
Yeah!

3700
02:26:03,890 --> 02:26:06,610
I hate when Pecota swamps me like that and that's crazy.

3701
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:07,710
Who?

3702
02:26:08,890 --> 02:26:09,370
Pecota!

3703
02:26:10,150 --> 02:26:10,670
Pecota!

3704
02:26:11,590 --> 02:26:13,790
Dakota in her jail outfit.

3705
02:26:14,170 --> 02:26:15,110
Wait, who's Dakota?

3706
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:16,190
Who's Dakota?

3707
02:26:17,550 --> 02:26:18,410
Who's Dakota?

3708
02:26:19,110 --> 02:26:19,490
Dakota?

3709
02:26:20,010 --> 02:26:20,750
Who's Dakota?

3710
02:26:25,990 --> 02:26:27,030
Oh, Pecora!

3711
02:26:27,390 --> 02:26:28,190
Oh, Pecora!

3712
02:26:28,430 --> 02:26:29,550
I also heard Dakota.

3713
02:26:30,370 --> 02:26:31,990
Yeah, I thought you were saying Dakota.

3714
02:26:32,210 --> 02:26:33,810
I thought you were saying Dakota also.

3715
02:26:34,290 --> 02:26:34,770
Dakota!

3716
02:26:35,910 --> 02:26:36,650
Haru, Haru.

3717
02:26:37,070 --> 02:26:38,030
She's all the way in the back.

3718
02:26:38,110 --> 02:26:38,690
She's about to die.

3719
02:26:39,270 --> 02:26:39,630
Oh, no!

3720
02:26:42,250 --> 02:26:43,330
Oh, it was a smoker.

3721
02:26:43,550 --> 02:26:44,550
Should I have done the impression?

3722
02:26:45,650 --> 02:26:46,510
Yeah, do it.

3723
02:26:46,610 --> 02:26:46,610
Do it.

3724
02:26:46,610 --> 02:26:46,950
I want to hear it.

3725
02:26:48,450 --> 02:26:50,430
Oh, that's good.

3726
02:26:51,210 --> 02:26:53,390
Guys, Haru, there's a...

3727
02:26:53,390 --> 02:26:54,610
Do you need a health kit, Haru?

3728
02:26:54,990 --> 02:26:56,110
Yes, I am bleeding.

3729
02:26:56,250 --> 02:26:58,090
Okay, come here, come here, and I will...

3730
02:26:58,090 --> 02:26:58,210
I'm going to die.

3731
02:26:58,850 --> 02:26:59,250
Hold on.

3732
02:26:59,410 --> 02:27:00,350
Stop, stop, stop, Haru?

3733
02:27:00,510 --> 02:27:01,210
All my spleens.

3734
02:27:01,690 --> 02:27:02,090
Spleens?

3735
02:27:02,970 --> 02:27:03,610
My spleens.

3736
02:27:03,890 --> 02:27:04,850
Oh, her spleens.

3737
02:27:05,110 --> 02:27:06,010
Where am I?

3738
02:27:06,070 --> 02:27:06,470
I'm bad.

3739
02:27:06,510 --> 02:27:07,190
I can't see anything.

3740
02:27:07,490 --> 02:27:08,970
I guess this is this way.

3741
02:27:09,990 --> 02:27:10,250
Yeah.

3742
02:27:12,090 --> 02:27:13,210
This way?

3743
02:27:13,210 --> 02:27:13,390
This way?

3744
02:27:13,410 --> 02:27:13,910

Oh.

3750
02:27:20,690 --> 02:27:23,510
Some cars set up alarms.

3751
02:27:24,210 --> 02:27:24,390
Uh oh.

3752
02:27:24,590 --> 02:27:25,530

Nice.

3754
02:27:31,670 --> 02:27:32,430

02:27:32,550 --> 02:27:32,950

Yeah, it is.

3830
02:29:51,270 --> 02:29:52,530
You don't have to say about my...

3831
02:29:52,530 --> 02:29:55,190
You don't want to mess with me with a train, so...

3832
02:29:55,190 --> 02:29:57,150
I'm still here, almost.

3833
02:29:58,070 --> 02:30:02,730
Oh, I forgot in my mod I gave him a card for me on shirts as
well, some of the monsters.

3834
02:30:03,030 --> 02:30:03,450
That's so fun.

3835
02:30:04,950 --> 02:30:05,350
No!

3836
02:30:05,590 --> 02:30:06,150
What do you mean?

3837
02:30:06,250 --> 02:30:07,670
I don't know what are you talking about?

3838
02:30:07,690 --> 02:30:08,990
Why you open the door, Hanya!

3839
02:30:09,650 --> 02:30:10,170

3840
02:30:10,350 --> 02:30:11,410
We're gonna go kill him.

3841
02:30:11,550 --> 02:30:11,690
Hanyor.

3842
02:30:12,650 --> 02:30:13,110
Time to kill.

3843
02:30:16,910 --> 02:30:17,630
Wait, where are you guys?

3844
02:30:17,770 --> 02:30:18,810
What city is this canonically?

3845
02:30:18,930 --> 02:30:20,650
Are we in like the United States?

3846
02:30:21,090 --> 02:30:21,850
Probably, right?

3847
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:29,380
Take them.

3848
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:30,320
Beautiful.

3849
02:30:31,500 --> 02:30:34,680
Rip and tear until everything is dead.

3850
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:36,740
Rip and tear.

3851
02:30:37,220 --> 02:30:37,860
Rip and tear.

3852
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:39,160

3853
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:40,400

3854
02:30:40,460 --> 02:30:40,660
Rip and tear.

3855
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:41,760
Rip and tear.

3856
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:47,400
This way?

3857
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:48,020
Kill.

3858
02:30:48,660 --> 02:30:48,680
Kill.

3859
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:49,400
I like train.

3860
02:30:57,540 --> 02:30:59,680
I'm gonna tell him it's Jigsaw.

3861
02:31:05,170 --> 02:31:05,610
Nice.

3862
02:31:06,730 --> 02:31:08,430
Oh, Haru's got it.

3863
02:31:09,150 --> 02:31:09,850
I do it.

3864
02:31:10,170 --> 02:31:10,410
I do it.

3865
02:31:10,410 --> 02:31:11,570
Haru, are you okay?

3866
02:31:11,870 --> 02:31:12,310
Let me catch you up.

3867
02:31:12,530 --> 02:31:13,370
Oh my gosh, are you okay?

3868
02:31:13,550 --> 02:31:14,990
Don't you, but I don't need a bed kit.

3869
02:31:15,330 --> 02:31:15,610
No!

3870
02:31:15,990 --> 02:31:16,370
No!

3871
02:31:16,770 --> 02:31:17,910
Take your meds, Grandpa!

3872
02:31:18,170 --> 02:31:19,850
Take your meds!

3873
02:31:19,850 --> 02:31:21,050
Take your meds, Haruka!

3874
02:31:21,110 --> 02:31:22,470
I'm taking my rage!

3875
02:31:23,090 --> 02:31:23,650
Oh, really?

3876
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:25,890
Take your meds, Haruka.

3877
02:31:26,570 --> 02:31:26,750
Never!

3878
02:31:27,090 --> 02:31:27,810
Oh, what's this one?

3879
02:31:29,010 --> 02:31:30,850
Oh, I think I want to go with this one.

3880
02:31:30,970 --> 02:31:32,330
Take your meds, Grandma.

3881
02:31:32,530 --> 02:31:34,790
Oh, there's my beautiful goon.

3882
02:31:35,630 --> 02:31:36,610
I'm ready to die.

3883
02:31:37,390 --> 02:31:37,830
Oh, sorry.

3884
02:31:38,090 --> 02:31:39,230
Can we not shoot me?

3885
02:31:39,290 --> 02:31:39,890
That would be great.

3886
02:31:40,210 --> 02:31:40,590
Sorry.

3887
02:31:41,330 --> 02:31:43,930
I don't need my meds, I just don't want any of you.

3888
02:31:43,930 --> 02:31:43,930
Sorry.

3889
02:31:43,950 --> 02:31:44,790
I'm so sorry.

3890
02:31:45,670 --> 02:31:47,370
My echo, Steve!

3891
02:31:48,330 --> 02:31:49,090
Oh, go Steve!

3892
02:31:50,810 --> 02:31:53,670
You don't want to face with my...

3893
02:31:53,670 --> 02:31:54,630
Oh, Steve!

3894
02:31:55,250 --> 02:31:57,010
Oh, John, leave me alone!

3895
02:31:57,370 --> 02:31:57,610
Steve!

3896
02:32:00,090 --> 02:32:01,630
Oh, here they come!

3897
02:32:02,910 --> 02:32:03,570

I think it's not my type of gun.

3955
02:34:33,010 --> 02:34:33,710
It's hard.

3956
02:34:34,190 --> 02:34:35,690
You have to shoot fast, you know?

I don't need no medicine.

4032
02:36:57,290 --> 02:36:58,150
I could just meditate.

4033
02:36:58,330 --> 02:37:00,450
My health will come back from normal quickly.

4034
02:37:01,010 --> 02:37:05,390
Manifest a healthy lifestyle and it will come to you.

4035
02:37:07,250 --> 02:37:10,010
Honestly, I need nothing but American burgers.

4036
02:37:10,370 --> 02:37:10,970

I swear to God.

4140
02:42:51,340 --> 02:42:56,780
I thought to myself, if I can get here, him to have a little
smaller genitalia, I'll be less intimidated.

4141
02:42:57,060 --> 02:42:58,080
What are you talking about?

02:47:02,330 --> 02:47:02,650
Let's go.

4251
02:47:03,990 --> 02:47:04,730
Just avoid her.

4252
02:47:04,790 --> 02:47:06,310
I think this is going to bite us in the ass.

4253
02:47:07,090 --> 02:47:08,250
Yeah, let's go over here.

4254
02:47:10,210 --> 02:47:10,770
That guy is dead.

4255
02:47:10,770 --> 02:47:12,270
I think this is going to backfire.

4256
02:47:12,310 --> 02:47:12,990
Like, you know what?

4257
02:47:13,470 --> 02:47:14,610
I don't like the rules.

4258
02:47:14,630 --> 02:47:15,450
We're not going back.

4259
02:47:15,550 --> 02:47:16,110
It'll be fine.

4260
02:47:16,210 --> 02:47:16,670
It'll be fine.

4261
02:47:16,910 --> 02:47:18,410
I'm just a little follower.

4262
02:47:18,790 --> 02:47:20,590
I think you just want to kill the witch.

4263
02:47:20,870 --> 02:47:21,850
Guys, guys, here, here, here.

4264
02:47:22,090 --> 02:47:23,130
I want to kill everything.

4265
02:47:23,750 --> 02:47:24,750
I'm ready to kill.

4266
02:47:24,750 --> 02:47:26,010
I'm going to kill Bill.

4267
02:47:27,850 --> 02:47:29,870
Oh, there's a secret passage over here.

4268
02:47:29,870 --> 02:47:30,310
What's this?

4269
02:47:30,650 --> 02:47:30,870
Yeah.

4270
02:47:31,230 --> 02:47:32,350
What is this?

4271
02:47:33,830 --> 02:47:33,950
Ah!

4272
02:47:34,950 --> 02:47:35,390

4273
02:47:35,850 --> 02:47:36,470
Oh, okay.

4274
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:37,890
You did it, honey.

4275

Thank you.

4276
02:47:39,190 --> 02:47:39,630
Molotov.

4277
02:47:39,930 --> 02:47:40,910
Wait, is there another witch?

4278
02:47:41,930 --> 02:47:42,370
Uh...

4279
02:47:42,370 --> 02:47:42,690
Huh?

4280
02:47:44,030 --> 02:47:45,330
No, I just made the ring.

4281
02:47:45,570 --> 02:47:46,330
The witch is the ring.

4282
02:47:47,470 --> 02:47:48,470
Like that girl with the ring.

4283
02:47:48,670 --> 02:47:49,250
Oh, really?

4284
02:47:49,310 --> 02:47:49,890

02:54:21,280 --> 02:54:23,900
I thought that was a sparkler.

4431
02:54:26,820 --> 02:54:28,920
Nice blast Thanks.

4432
02:54:30,220 --> 02:54:32,180
Busting makes her feel good!

4433
02:54:32,500 --> 02:54:33,660
Busting, Busting, Busting.

4434
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:34,520
Oh!

4435
02:54:35,580 --> 02:54:37,340
I got you, princess.

4436
02:54:37,800 --> 02:54:38,380
Thank you.

4437
02:54:38,860 --> 02:54:40,640
Busting made me feel good.

4438
02:54:41,180 --> 02:54:44,640
Busting, Busting, Busting, Busting, Busting, Busting.

4439
02:54:46,100 --> 02:54:48,260
I didn't know she was there!

4440
02:54:48,460 --> 02:54:48,700
Oh.

4441
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:51,940
Don't worry, I think that's the point, girl.

4442
02:54:52,400 --> 02:54:52,880
Um...

4443
02:54:52,880 --> 02:54:53,580
Hehehehe.

4444
02:54:55,980 --> 02:54:58,520
So you're probably wondering how I got here.

02:54:59,080 --> 02:55:00,040
Funny story.

4446
02:55:00,620 --> 02:55:01,440

Oh, thanks.

4448

4476
02:56:53,110 --> 02:56:54,150
A bio.

4477
02:56:54,490 --> 02:56:55,030
Oh, there we go.

4478
02:56:55,190 --> 02:56:56,170
Oh, four's my lucky number.

4479
02:56:57,630 --> 02:56:59,390
4's my favorite number.

4480
02:56:59,730 --> 02:57:01,310
30 is my favorite number.

4481
02:57:01,750 --> 02:57:03,010
4 is my favorite number.

4482
02:57:03,710 --> 02:57:05,090
Miss, hit your own favorite number.

4483
02:57:05,490 --> 02:57:06,110
Oh, wait.

4484
02:57:06,170 --> 02:57:06,710
Is that your favorite?

4485
02:57:06,830 --> 02:57:08,290
I got this number first.

4486
02:57:08,510 --> 02:57:09,150
It's dead.

4487
02:57:09,790 --> 02:57:11,270
Why's everyone picking four?

4488
02:57:11,530 --> 02:57:14,370
Miss, I liked number four before you were dead.

4489
02:57:14,650 --> 02:57:17,510
I liked four forever.

4490
02:57:19,210 --> 02:57:20,730
Four as old.

4491
02:57:21,050 --> 02:57:21,550
Four as.

4492
02:57:21,610 --> 02:57:23,350
4 plus infinity!

4493
02:57:24,110 --> 02:57:27,290
It's the day that I was born, my flesh woman!

4494
02:57:27,790 --> 02:57:28,850
Hence, it's mine!

4495
02:57:29,430 --> 02:57:32,070
Okay, how do we both like the number 4?

4496
02:57:34,430 --> 02:57:35,090
How about that?

4497
02:57:35,110 --> 02:57:36,150
How about we both can like our number 4?

4498
02:57:36,150 --> 02:57:39,010
If we like 44, we can split the 4, you know?

4499
02:57:39,250 --> 02:57:39,970
No, I like 2.

4500
02:57:40,090 --> 02:57:40,770
I like 24.

4501
02:57:41,210 --> 02:57:41,330
Oh.

4502
02:57:41,870 --> 02:57:42,390
Oh, sorry.

4503
02:57:42,790 --> 02:57:45,490
I keep like timing out of my game and then clicking back in.

4504
02:57:47,110 --> 02:57:48,350
Just right click back in, that's what I do.

4505
02:57:50,350 --> 02:57:51,090
Behind you, Haru?

4506
02:57:58,350 --> 02:58:00,670
It says stay out of the line of fire.

4507
02:58:00,730 --> 02:58:02,630
Wow, this is such a beautiful scene.

4508
02:58:04,970 --> 02:58:06,810
I'm sorry, you scared me!

4509
02:58:06,930 --> 02:58:08,690
Don't come running up on me, old man!

4510
02:58:09,850 --> 02:58:11,470
I was getting pushed over.

4511
02:58:11,930 --> 02:58:13,370
I was just looking over.

4512
02:58:14,850 --> 02:58:15,690
Wait, did you fall?

4513
02:58:16,270 --> 02:58:17,030
Yeah, I did.

4514
02:58:19,450 --> 02:58:20,410
Whoopsie poopsie.

4515
02:58:20,510 --> 02:58:22,090
Oh, there's a smoker nearby.

4516
02:58:24,270 --> 02:58:24,750
Hey!

4517
02:58:24,750 --> 02:58:25,170
Hey!

4518
02:58:26,210 --> 02:58:26,910
I'm coming.

4519
02:58:27,070 --> 02:58:27,430
Oh, I'm coming.

4520
02:58:27,870 --> 02:58:28,050
I'm coming.

4521
02:58:28,130 --> 02:58:28,350
I'm coming.

4522
02:58:28,470 --> 02:58:28,690
I'm coming.

4523
02:58:28,810 --> 02:58:29,130
Smoker.

4524
02:58:29,710 --> 02:58:29,710
Smoker.

4525
02:58:30,050 --> 02:58:30,050
Smoker.

4526
02:58:30,050 --> 02:58:30,570
You got her?

4527
02:58:30,810 --> 02:58:30,810
Yep.

4528
02:58:31,750 --> 02:58:32,150
Smoker.

4529
02:58:32,770 --> 02:58:33,970
I got you.

4530
02:58:34,110 --> 02:58:35,910
Listen, we both collected number four.

4531
02:58:36,110 --> 02:58:36,910
This is a truce.

4532
02:58:37,110 --> 02:58:37,650
Good job, girl.

4533
02:58:37,870 --> 02:58:38,410
Yes, the truce.

4534
02:58:39,070 --> 02:58:39,550
Yes, the truce.

4535
02:58:39,690 --> 02:58:40,390
Take your medicine.

4536
02:58:40,710 --> 02:58:41,090
Good job.

4537
02:58:41,490 --> 02:58:42,370
Wait, what about me?

4538
02:58:42,490 --> 02:58:43,870
You both didn't make a truce with me.

4539
02:58:44,050 --> 02:58:44,730
I don't have enough.

4540
02:58:44,890 --> 02:58:47,490
My brain's not calm enough to meditate right now.

4541
02:58:47,610 --> 02:58:47,910
Okay.

4542
02:58:48,050 --> 02:58:50,570
So I need to find a nice, calm spot to meditate.

4543
02:58:50,650 --> 02:58:51,090
You know what I'm saying?

4544
02:58:51,290 --> 02:58:52,790
There's a thing to blow up.

4545
02:58:54,050 --> 02:58:55,030
Blow it up, Mint.

4546
02:58:55,350 --> 02:58:55,570
No.

4547
02:58:55,570 --> 02:58:56,930
Listen to the demons in your head.

4548
02:58:56,990 --> 02:58:58,730
No reason to...

4549
02:58:58,730 --> 02:58:58,790
Oh.

4550
02:59:06,230 --> 02:59:06,630
Reloading.

4551
02:59:09,110 --> 02:59:09,510
Smoker.

4552
02:59:10,290 --> 02:59:11,590
I hardly even know her.

4553
02:59:11,830 --> 02:59:12,370
Is it this way?

4554
02:59:13,270 --> 02:59:13,670
Careful.

4555
02:59:14,070 --> 02:59:15,510
Did you blow up the gas tank?

4556
02:59:15,670 --> 02:59:17,230
For funsies, what if there was enemies?

4557
02:59:17,850 --> 02:59:18,210
Oh my.

4558
02:59:18,310 --> 02:59:19,310
What if we had to go that way?

4559
02:59:20,250 --> 02:59:21,270
Well, we could wait.

4560
02:59:22,250 --> 02:59:23,230
Uh-oh, I hear music.

4561
02:59:23,930 --> 02:59:24,650
I hear a little guy.

4562
02:59:25,230 --> 02:59:25,510
Nice.

4563
02:59:26,210 --> 02:59:26,930
Poor toes.

4564
02:59:27,350 --> 02:59:28,810
I got the boomer.

4565
02:59:30,690 --> 02:59:32,290
I killed Matara Khan.

4566
02:59:32,290 --> 02:59:35,250
So you're seeing Peter's head being ripped apart.

4567
02:59:35,390 --> 02:59:35,650
What?

4568
02:59:38,610 --> 02:59:40,710
Honestly, living with you is worse than death.

4569
02:59:42,510 --> 02:59:43,470
I don't even live.

4570
02:59:43,630 --> 02:59:44,690
You're not living with me at all.

4571
02:59:45,190 --> 02:59:45,390
Sorry.

4572
02:59:46,650 --> 02:59:47,030
It's okay.

4573
02:59:47,130 --> 02:59:48,530
I like to get shot by you.

4574
02:59:49,230 --> 02:59:49,750
Oh, nice.

4575
02:59:50,130 --> 02:59:51,970
You can shoot me as many times as you want.

4576
02:59:52,890 --> 02:59:52,930
Yay.

4577
02:59:53,750 --> 02:59:54,550
Just you.

4578
02:59:54,850 --> 02:59:55,550
Is that a spear?

4579
02:59:55,650 --> 02:59:57,030
I'm going to bleed out here soon, guys.

4580

Yeah.

4584
03:00:31,030 --> 03:00:32,390
Beep, beep, beep.

4585
03:00:35,470 --> 03:00:38,670
I only did the most damage because she was on top of me.

4586
03:00:41,070 --> 03:00:43,250
That's the most action you'll ever get.

4587
03:00:43,510 --> 03:00:45,210
It's true, actually.

4588
03:00:45,870 --> 03:00:48,670
Dang, why'd you have to tell the truth like that?

4589
03:00:48,710 --> 03:00:50,190
Hold on, I gotta meditate real quick.

4590
03:00:50,190 --> 03:00:51,010
Why are you such a truther?

4591
03:00:51,570 --> 03:00:53,410
Girls, get your health packs.

4592
03:00:54,590 --> 03:00:56,090
Get your med packs.

4593
03:00:56,090 --> 03:00:56,210
Get your med packs.

4594
03:00:56,230 --> 03:00:57,310
Ooh, that was a good meditation.

4595
03:00:57,330 --> 03:00:58,530
Don't forget them.

4596
03:00:58,850 --> 03:01:06,310
There's a Molotov and a pipe bomb and a pipe dream No, it
doesn't three days.

4597
03:01:06,550 --> 03:01:07,530
What's a better gun, everybody?

4598
03:01:07,650 --> 03:01:07,990
This one?

4599
03:01:08,350 --> 03:01:08,730
Number one?

4600
03:01:09,070 --> 03:01:10,730
Or this one?

4601
03:01:10,950 --> 03:01:12,750
Oh, it takes four days to change.

4602
03:01:12,950 --> 03:01:13,470
No, it doesn't.

4603
03:01:14,070 --> 03:01:15,470
It takes two and a half pounds.

4604
03:01:15,790 --> 03:01:16,030
Number two.

4605
03:01:16,410 --> 03:01:17,610
Move during the day.

4606
03:01:18,010 --> 03:01:18,870
Or this one, number three.

4607
03:01:19,010 --> 03:01:20,510
Only come out at night.

4608
03:01:20,830 --> 03:01:21,450
That's not true.

4609
03:01:21,770 --> 03:01:22,710
They're here all the time.

4610
03:01:23,090 --> 03:01:24,650
No zombie is safe.

4611
03:01:25,170 --> 03:01:25,530
No zombie.

4612
03:01:26,030 --> 03:01:27,170
I'm keeping this gun.

4613
03:01:27,330 --> 03:01:28,810
I like Chicago.

4614
03:01:29,030 --> 03:01:30,790
I saw it happens in five minutes.

4615
03:01:31,130 --> 03:01:31,610
Let's go!

4616
03:01:31,950 --> 03:01:33,210
Oh, he wouldn't have that one.

4617
03:01:33,330 --> 03:01:34,150
Did we take all the med kit?

4618
03:01:34,370 --> 03:01:35,690
Let's fucking go!

4619
03:01:35,870 --> 03:01:38,190
Kill, kill, kill!

4620
03:01:39,750 --> 03:01:41,170
Oh, I should have reloaded.

4621
03:01:41,370 --> 03:01:42,210
That's embarrassing.

4622
03:01:42,990 --> 03:01:43,790
His little butt!

4623
03:01:43,970 --> 03:01:45,010

4624
03:01:46,170 --> 03:01:47,330
I saw his little butt!

4625
03:01:48,230 --> 03:01:49,150
That's embarrassing.

4626
03:01:49,530 --> 03:01:49,670
What?

4627
03:01:50,530 --> 03:01:51,450
So embarrassing.

4628
03:01:51,630 --> 03:01:52,010
Oh my god.

4629
03:01:52,070 --> 03:01:54,630

4630
03:01:54,750 --> 03:01:55,850

4637
03:02:36,270 --> 03:02:40,730
I think the jockey just, or the cutter, I think he just fell
to his death.

03:02:41,230 --> 03:02:41,810
Come on, goat.

4639
03:02:42,950 --> 03:02:45,330
That was so funny, I listened to him scream.

4640
03:02:45,810 --> 03:02:47,310
I've heard his final words.

4641
03:02:48,730 --> 03:02:50,590
Oh, how do I get up here?

4642
03:02:50,830 --> 03:02:51,650
Wait, how do I get up here?

4643
03:02:51,870 --> 03:02:52,090
Oh, there we go.

4644
03:02:52,110 --> 03:02:53,550
You climb, bitch.

4645
03:02:54,250 --> 03:02:54,970

4646
03:02:55,430 --> 03:02:55,990
Oh, this here.

4647
03:02:56,030 --> 03:02:56,730
Right here.

4648
03:02:58,650 --> 03:03:00,490
Oh, this kind of looks like a Batman.

4649
03:03:02,030 --> 03:03:02,130
Oh.

4650
03:03:02,150 --> 03:03:04,610
Oh, this is a perfect time for a sniper.

4651
03:03:07,110 --> 03:03:08,590
Get away from me!

4652
03:03:09,030 --> 03:03:10,510
Get away from me.

4653
03:03:10,770 --> 03:03:11,250
I'm talking to you!

4654
03:03:11,450 --> 03:03:12,310
I'm talking to you, Batara!

4655
03:03:12,910 --> 03:03:12,910
You freak!

4656
03:03:13,150 --> 03:03:14,990
Get away from me, you freak!

4657
03:03:15,870 --> 03:03:17,650
Barrel gets obsessed with me!

4658
03:03:19,890 --> 03:03:21,490
I'm not even listening to you anymore.

4659
03:03:22,390 --> 03:03:24,030
I'm not even listening to you anymore.

4660
03:03:26,110 --> 03:03:28,070
I think we have to go down here.

4661
03:03:28,390 --> 03:03:28,870
Batman!

4662
03:03:30,030 --> 03:03:30,510
Batman!

4663
03:03:32,010 --> 03:03:35,830
Oh, I didn't miss, all right, I didn't miss at all,
obviously.

4664
03:03:37,150 --> 03:03:38,410
Yeah, that'd be crazy if I missed.

4665
03:03:40,530 --> 03:03:41,790
Why do I, oh, oh.

4666
03:03:43,630 --> 03:03:44,110
Sorry.

4667
03:03:44,910 --> 03:03:49,130
I'm trying, oh, help me please, I'm getting, I'm in an
anime.

4668
03:03:49,710 --> 03:03:51,830
Matara, I'm not Matara, I'm coming, okay, never mind.

4669
03:03:52,490 --> 03:03:55,190
Did you just talk to yourself in the third room?

4670
03:03:56,050 --> 03:03:58,730
I called you Matara, my ex.

4671
03:03:59,450 --> 03:04:01,370
Listen, I am all video games out.

4672
03:04:02,690 --> 03:04:06,010
I am old and this game is a lot for my old women brain.

4673
03:04:06,030 --> 03:04:06,150
It is a lot.

4674
03:04:06,330 --> 03:04:07,270
It is so much.

4675
03:04:07,330 --> 03:04:07,710
It's okay.

4676
03:04:08,810 --> 03:04:10,390
I'm Mataura now everybody.

4677
03:04:11,570 --> 03:04:11,850
Hi, honey.

4678
03:04:11,850 --> 03:04:12,490
Hi, everyone.

4679
03:04:12,810 --> 03:04:13,590
Hi, man.

4680
03:04:13,790 --> 03:04:15,310
I love me.

4681
03:04:15,310 --> 03:04:17,450
There's a grenade launcher here if anyone wants to.

4682
03:04:17,470 --> 03:04:18,390
Wait, there's a medkid over here.

4683
03:04:18,490 --> 03:04:19,110
And a medkid.

4684
03:04:19,550 --> 03:04:19,990
Oh, medkid.

4685
03:04:20,910 --> 03:04:23,670
There's a medkid, there's ammo, and there's a gun.

4686
03:04:23,910 --> 03:04:25,970
Why do you say like it's a bad thing that I like boobies,
you know?

4687
03:04:26,030 --> 03:04:30,850
I love boobies and cute girls and cute girls with boobies.

4688
03:04:33,610 --> 03:04:35,510
There's a grenade launcher over here.

4689
03:04:35,510 --> 03:04:35,910
Yeah.

4690
03:04:36,010 --> 03:04:37,130
I like my gun.

4691
03:04:37,810 --> 03:04:38,290
I love you.

4692
03:04:39,090 --> 03:04:40,270
Yeah, I'll take it.

4693
03:04:40,530 --> 03:04:41,450
Take it, take it.

4694
03:04:41,710 --> 03:04:42,790
Rescue's coming, girls.

4695
03:04:42,970 --> 03:04:43,730
Defend yourselves.

4696
03:04:44,190 --> 03:04:47,970
Let's all stand together and then, yeah.

4697
03:04:48,550 --> 03:04:50,430
Oh, there's health kits right here, by the way.

4698
03:04:51,330 --> 03:04:52,210
I'm throwing...

4699
03:04:52,210 --> 03:04:53,230
There's health kits where I'm at, guys.

4700
03:04:53,330 --> 03:04:57,030
I'm throwing, um, I'm throwing gasoline if anyone wants to
blow it up.

4701
03:04:58,350 --> 03:05:00,270
Okay, maybe I like my gun better.

4702
03:05:06,500 --> 03:05:06,860
Spitter.

4703
03:05:07,740 --> 03:05:08,340
Where's the spitter?

4704
03:05:08,900 --> 03:05:09,460
I don't know.

4705
03:05:10,300 --> 03:05:10,440
Oh.

4706
03:05:11,200 --> 03:05:11,520
Oh my gosh.

4707
03:05:11,540 --> 03:05:14,360
There's a health kit near me guys if you want.

4708
03:05:15,220 --> 03:05:15,560
Hanya?

4709
03:05:15,720 --> 03:05:15,920
Hanya?

4710
03:05:16,600 --> 03:05:16,960
No!

4711

I got you.

4712
03:05:18,320 --> 03:05:18,640
I got you.

4713
03:05:18,840 --> 03:05:19,420
Girl, don't worry.

4714
03:05:20,460 --> 03:05:20,900
Oh god.

4715
03:05:21,340 --> 03:05:21,520
Hold on.

4716
03:05:21,520 --> 03:05:21,980
Hold on.

4717
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:22,960
Wait, who did I just see?

4718
03:05:22,960 --> 03:05:24,620
I'm here trying to help Hanya, but I need your guys.

4719
03:05:24,800 --> 03:05:26,500
Hanya, can you keep shooting the ones in front of you?

4720
03:05:26,580 --> 03:05:26,900
I'm trying.

4721
03:05:27,460 --> 03:05:27,620
I'm trying.

4722
03:05:27,860 --> 03:05:28,020
I'm trying.

4723
03:05:28,440 --> 03:05:29,060
Oh no.

4724
03:05:29,200 --> 03:05:30,060
Oh, we got the Jackie.

4725
03:05:30,440 --> 03:05:31,060
I got the Jackie.

4726
03:05:31,560 --> 03:05:32,440
I can't help you.

4727
03:05:32,460 --> 03:05:33,600
I'm saving Hanya.

4728
03:05:35,440 --> 03:05:37,740
Um, I'll just die, I think, actually.

4729
03:05:37,740 --> 03:05:39,460
I think I'm just gonna die.

4730
03:05:40,680 --> 03:05:41,360
Yeah, I'm down.

4731
03:05:42,600 --> 03:05:43,680
I'm sorry, I was down.

4732
03:05:43,800 --> 03:05:44,640
I wasn't near you.

4733
03:05:47,920 --> 03:05:49,260
Hania, dyeshobu, use your medkit.

4734
03:05:49,700 --> 03:05:51,620
Oh, sorry if I shot you.

4735
03:05:52,740 --> 03:05:53,660
Use your medkit, Hania.

4736
03:05:54,080 --> 03:05:55,060
Okay, okay, I will.

4737
03:05:55,140 --> 03:05:57,900
There was medkit nearby me, but I don't know if you guys
heard me.

4738
03:05:58,700 --> 03:05:59,740
Yeah, we're coming.

4739
03:06:00,080 --> 03:06:03,360
I have one, so I just gotta get revived and I'll be good.

4740
03:06:03,520 --> 03:06:05,080
I'm coming, you jerk.

4741
03:06:05,900 --> 03:06:06,820
Oh, spitter.

4742
03:06:06,920 --> 03:06:07,860
Francis, let's go.

4743
03:06:08,040 --> 03:06:08,260
Get up.

4744
03:06:08,820 --> 03:06:09,300
He's a quitter.

4745
03:06:09,880 --> 03:06:09,980
Francis.

4746
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:11,100
Who was Francis?

4747
03:06:11,560 --> 03:06:11,960
Oh, that's me.

4748
03:06:12,100 --> 03:06:13,180
How was Francis?

4749
03:06:14,160 --> 03:06:14,720
What a suit.

4750
03:06:15,600 --> 03:06:16,960
Haha, he's showing his butt.

4751
03:06:17,140 --> 03:06:17,840
So embarrassing.

4752
03:06:18,220 --> 03:06:18,940
Ah, your dog.

4753
03:06:19,340 --> 03:06:19,940
Lucky me.

4754
03:06:19,960 --> 03:06:24,360
Oh, I'm reloading, I'm reloading.

4755
03:06:24,460 --> 03:06:25,400
Oh, you got him though.

4756
03:06:28,160 --> 03:06:29,080
Silly zombies.

4757
03:06:30,260 --> 03:06:31,780
What do you think?

4758
03:06:32,720 --> 03:06:34,760
I really want to stay at your house.

4759
03:06:34,760 --> 03:06:35,140
Tank?

4760
03:06:35,440 --> 03:06:36,340
Oh, this is behind you.

4761
03:06:36,420 --> 03:06:36,720
Oh, behind you.

4762

Thank you, Hadou.

4764
03:06:40,220 --> 03:06:40,680
My angel.

4765
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:42,600
Uh-oh.

4766
03:06:43,540 --> 03:06:44,420
Metal gear!

4767
03:06:45,580 --> 03:06:46,020
No!

4768
03:06:46,580 --> 03:06:46,840
Wait.

4769
03:06:47,540 --> 03:06:48,140
Oh, my gosh.

4770
03:06:48,420 --> 03:06:48,840
Throw!

4771
03:06:49,100 --> 03:06:50,320
I'm throwing a pipe bomb!

4772
03:06:50,520 --> 03:06:50,720
Uh-oh.

4773
03:06:50,880 --> 03:06:51,060
Wait.

4774
03:06:51,340 --> 03:06:51,780
Oh, oh.

4775
03:06:56,190 --> 03:06:56,930
Watch out!

4776
03:06:59,820 --> 03:07:00,540
Oh, my gosh.

4777
03:07:00,620 --> 03:07:01,440
Please reload.

4778
03:07:01,540 --> 03:07:02,700
What's taking so long?

4779
03:07:03,020 --> 03:07:04,340
What was taking so long?

4780
03:07:06,360 --> 03:07:06,800
Hadou!

4781
03:07:07,240 --> 03:07:07,940
I got you!

4782
03:07:08,540 --> 03:07:09,720
Oh, fuck, I can hide that.

4783
03:07:09,720 --> 03:07:10,340
Oh, fuck.

4784
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:13,640
Thank you!

4785
03:07:14,260 --> 03:07:15,100
See you!

4786
03:07:15,240 --> 03:07:16,860
Oh my gosh!

4787
03:07:19,400 --> 03:07:20,440
Get right.

4788
03:07:20,740 --> 03:07:21,200
Uh, Bio spit her down.

4789
03:07:21,440 --> 03:07:21,860
Bio spit her down.

4790
03:07:22,020 --> 03:07:22,260

4794
03:07:27,500 --> 03:07:29,000

Is there any ammo anywhere?

4807
03:08:16,670 --> 03:08:18,470
Yes, on a lot of spots.

03:08:18,770 --> 03:08:19,110

03:08:28,050 --> 03:08:28,970
Firing a home.

03:08:54,350 --> 03:08:55,730
Getting tongue, getting tongue, getting tongue!

4828

4980
03:13:55,680 --> 03:13:57,140

03:15:17,700 --> 03:15:19,160
Not even a fraction.

4998
03:15:19,480 --> 03:15:22,920
Well, I guess technically a fraction because I was in the
game.

4999
03:15:24,440 --> 03:15:26,360

Unfortunately, it won't show like if someone joins normally,
but I'll try to keep it.

5037
03:18:01,500 --> 03:18:04,800
I'll try to notice it when it happens.

5038
03:18:05,260 --> 03:18:06,380
What was the problem?

5039
03:18:06,680 --> 03:18:07,760
It wasn't really a problem.

5040
03:18:07,960 --> 03:18:14,480
It was just that if someone gifted a lot of Donut or a lot
of memberships, it would just like be like, so-and-so became

5041
03:18:14,480 --> 03:18:14,940
a member.

5042
03:18:15,360 --> 03:18:16,680
So-and-so became a member.

5043
03:18:17,320 --> 03:18:20,760
And it would like, it made the like really backed up.

5044
03:18:25,480 --> 03:18:27,480
What do you guys have planned for the weekend?

5045
03:18:28,200 --> 03:18:29,680

5048
03:18:34,600 --> 03:18:34,700

5049
03:18:38,020 --> 03:18:38,420

03:18:57,230 --> 03:18:58,270
You haven't had enough zombies?

5057
03:18:58,530 --> 03:18:59,370
I think I've had it.

5058
03:18:59,410 --> 03:19:00,710
I'm all zombed out.

5059
03:19:01,470 --> 03:19:02,710
I'm zombed out.

5060
03:19:03,190 --> 03:19:03,790
I'm a ghost.

5061
03:19:03,970 --> 03:19:04,730
Not a zombie.

5062
03:19:05,410 --> 03:19:05,930
I'm dead.

5063
03:19:06,450 --> 03:19:07,230
Not undead.

5064
03:19:09,690 --> 03:19:11,810
Going to a convention next to day.

5065
03:19:12,010 --> 03:19:12,690
Sorry if I don't catch change.

5066
03:19:12,970 --> 03:19:13,870
Wait, what con?

5067
03:19:14,270 --> 03:19:15,410
What convention is this weekend?

5068
03:19:17,990 --> 03:19:19,630
What convention is this weekend?

5069
03:19:25,990 --> 03:19:27,270
I, um...

5070
03:19:27,270 --> 03:19:28,470
Oh, Saucon!

5071
03:19:28,990 --> 03:19:31,170
I think that's every weekend, though, actually.

5072
03:19:32,750 --> 03:19:36,130
Why can't I remember Saucon, but I can't remember the names?

5073
03:19:37,270 --> 03:19:38,070
Oh, well.

5074
03:19:38,770 --> 03:19:39,350
Plants vs.

5075
03:19:39,550 --> 03:19:40,950
Zombies 15th anniversary this weekend.

5076
03:19:41,270 --> 03:19:42,350
No way, really!

5077
03:19:43,250 --> 03:19:43,730
Wow.

5078
03:19:45,490 --> 03:19:46,130
Meep!

5079
03:19:46,370 --> 03:19:47,310
Thanks for the 10!

5080
03:19:47,650 --> 03:19:48,290
Gifted!

5081
03:19:48,870 --> 03:19:50,730
It's a local convention in Mexico.

5082
03:19:51,010 --> 03:19:51,330
Oh!

5083
03:19:52,210 --> 03:19:52,850
Awesome.

5084
03:19:53,050 --> 03:19:55,350
Wait, they have a convention during Cinco de Mayo?

5085
03:19:58,110 --> 03:20:03,290
I guess, I mean, I guess it's kind of the same when, like,
uh, what's it?

5086
03:20:04,210 --> 03:20:09,870
Anime Expo does theirs on, on, uh, 4th of July.

5087
03:20:10,730 --> 03:20:11,390
Thanks, man.

5088
03:20:11,470 --> 03:20:12,750
What did I do?

5089
03:20:14,850 --> 03:20:15,950
Hooray, thank you.

5090
03:20:16,010 --> 03:20:18,130
When I started watching you, I just quit my job.

5091
03:20:18,210 --> 03:20:20,970
Leaving was scary, but watching you inspired me to push to
the fear.

5092
03:20:21,410 --> 03:20:23,030
Monday, I started my apprenticeship because...

5093
03:20:24,050 --> 03:20:24,530
Airplanes!

5094
03:20:25,090 --> 03:20:26,430
Thank you, Mint, for being my push.

5095
03:20:26,530 --> 03:20:29,390
Oh my gosh, Ray, we need you in the world right now,
actually.

5096
03:20:31,130 --> 03:20:36,930
Oh my gosh, I was looking at my flights for some of my
upcoming events that I'm going to.

5097
03:20:37,890 --> 03:20:41,150
You guys, two of my flights are Boeing.

5098
03:20:43,090 --> 03:20:46,750
If I don't make it, go on without me.

5099
03:20:47,190 --> 03:20:49,870
I might be seeing the light this...

5100
03:20:49,870 --> 03:20:51,150
Not this weekend.

5101
03:20:54,610 --> 03:20:57,030
Chiron-chai, thank you for the toladi gift, thank you.

5102
03:20:58,750 --> 03:21:01,790
Uh, but they're not...

5103
03:21:01,790 --> 03:21:03,650
Can I call dibs on your stuff, sure?

5104
03:21:06,470 --> 03:21:15,730
Um, no, it's not the 737 max, but it is a 737, so I'm kind
of scared, legitimately.

5105
03:21:19,450 --> 03:21:23,010
But, uh, um, I would say YOLO.

5106
03:21:23,050 --> 03:21:24,290
But I'm already dead.

5107
03:21:27,930 --> 03:21:28,590
And I can't.

5108
03:21:28,590 --> 03:21:29,790
I can't change it.

5109
03:21:29,910 --> 03:21:31,270
Which is the worst part about it.

5110
03:21:31,530 --> 03:21:31,870
Don't worry.

5111
03:21:32,010 --> 03:21:32,590
You'll be safe.

5112
03:21:36,930 --> 03:21:38,590
What's the worst that could happen?

5113
03:21:38,850 --> 03:21:40,830
I'll just make sure my Yoda.

5114
03:21:42,350 --> 03:21:43,910
You only die once.

5115
03:21:46,470 --> 03:21:47,590
Momo Raid.

5116
03:21:48,590 --> 03:21:49,690
Thank you.

5117
03:21:50,310 --> 03:21:51,350
Hi Mataro.

5118
03:21:53,050 --> 03:21:53,750
Mose.

5119
03:21:54,490 --> 03:21:55,290
Hello, hello.

5120
03:21:56,110 --> 03:21:57,410
Hello, hello.

5121
03:21:57,510 --> 03:22:00,230
Momo Raid, Manuel Raid.

5122
03:22:01,510 --> 03:22:03,090
Momo Raid.

5123
03:22:03,530 --> 03:22:06,030
What are you guys doing here?

5124
03:22:06,550 --> 03:22:07,030
What?

5125
03:22:07,630 --> 03:22:08,830
Oh, my gosh.

5126
03:22:08,950 --> 03:22:10,530
Where did you all come from?

5127
03:22:10,750 --> 03:22:13,630
Why are you gifting 15?

5128
03:22:14,670 --> 03:22:15,930
Stop that.

5129
03:22:17,770 --> 03:22:19,730
Batarokan, I'm going to tell your mother.

5130
03:22:21,410 --> 03:22:22,330
Batarokan.

5131
03:22:23,050 --> 03:22:26,390
In case anyone is watching, Mint Knows Information is about
to blow the whistle on it.

5132
03:22:26,510 --> 03:22:26,910
Get her!

5133
03:22:28,010 --> 03:22:28,890
Bleep, bleep!

5134
03:22:32,370 --> 03:22:34,690
What if the door blows open, though?

5135
03:22:35,310 --> 03:22:36,750
And I just float away.

5136
03:22:38,330 --> 03:22:39,150
I just float.

5137
03:22:40,410 --> 03:22:42,450
What if I land in Ohio?

5138
03:22:44,830 --> 03:22:45,710
Oh, no.

5139
03:22:46,570 --> 03:22:47,010
Paperbacks.

5140
03:22:47,310 --> 03:22:48,030
Thanks for the 10 gift.

5141
03:22:48,130 --> 03:22:48,670
Thank you.

5142
03:22:49,390 --> 03:22:49,850
Thank you.

5143
03:22:50,010 --> 03:22:50,290
Thank you.

5144
03:22:51,090 --> 03:22:52,470
Morris, welcome to Mambushup.

5145
03:22:53,050 --> 03:22:55,730
I think you have five minute follow mode.

5146
03:22:55,970 --> 03:22:56,770
So my take of...

5147
03:22:58,630 --> 03:23:00,130
It was so fun.

5148
03:23:00,530 --> 03:23:02,650
Matara, good luck with your tournament later this month.

5149
03:23:02,770 --> 03:23:03,330
I hope...

5150
03:23:03,330 --> 03:23:09,390
It's probably good that you played this time because imagine
not playing before the tournament and seeing how

5151
03:23:09,390 --> 03:23:11,270
overwhelming and insane it is.

5152
03:23:13,690 --> 03:23:15,710
My message doesn't show on the screen.

5153
03:23:16,230 --> 03:23:17,410
I see you right there.

5154
03:23:18,210 --> 03:23:18,730
Ropewash!

5155
03:23:18,930 --> 03:23:19,570
Thanks for the 10 gift.

5156
03:23:19,650 --> 03:23:20,210
Thank you.

5157
03:23:20,730 --> 03:23:21,790
The game is crazy.

5158
03:23:23,270 --> 03:23:27,110
Just like, you have to like, put, okay, are you gonna be
streaming it?

5159
03:23:27,250 --> 03:23:32,830
Because if you're not streaming, you can literally like put
yourself into a trance and not even like talk.

5160
03:23:33,010 --> 03:23:38,710
You can just, oh, you could just, like,

5161
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:48,420
like this.

5162
03:23:51,080 --> 03:23:56,840
Also, do you like my, do you like, do you like my really
calming music after all of this?

5163
03:23:58,400 --> 03:24:00,120
Can you just play the bunny game again?

5164
03:24:02,500 --> 03:24:02,900
Sasuga.

5165
03:24:03,360 --> 03:24:07,060
I have to continue because I want to get to the parts where
you play with the cameras too.

5166
03:24:08,060 --> 03:24:10,540
But did I even leave space in my schedule for next week?

5167
03:24:11,120 --> 03:24:11,760
Let me see.

5168
03:24:13,280 --> 03:24:15,540
I have another collab next week actually.

5169
03:24:16,960 --> 03:24:18,180
I'm not going to say you...

5170
03:24:18,180 --> 03:24:19,000
Oh wait, I do.

5171
03:24:19,140 --> 03:24:20,620
I do have a room.

5172
03:24:21,140 --> 03:24:22,620
Okay, bunny garden.

5173
03:24:24,920 --> 03:24:25,900
I can do it.

5174
03:24:27,100 --> 03:24:27,480
Hmm.

5175
03:24:28,520 --> 03:24:28,560
Um.

5176
03:24:29,940 --> 03:24:30,540
Uh.

5177
03:24:31,800 --> 03:24:32,400
Um.

5178
03:24:33,380 --> 03:24:35,040
Matara already said who it's with?

5179
03:24:36,580 --> 03:24:36,740
Huh?

5180
03:24:37,320 --> 03:24:38,940
I don't think I told her.

5181
03:24:45,290 --> 03:24:46,750
No, that's not next week.

5182
03:24:50,570 --> 03:24:52,050
They're thinking of Deep Rock Galactic.

5183
03:24:52,230 --> 03:24:52,950
Oh, yeah.

5184
03:24:53,110 --> 03:24:54,670
Deep Rock Galactic's not next week.

5185
03:24:54,970 --> 03:24:56,210
No, no.

Hashtag carried by Matara.

Slash sarc.

5221
03:27:18,970 --> 03:27:21,270
You have to put the sarcasm in there.

5222
03:27:22,290 --> 03:27:22,650
Bravo!

5223
03:27:23,390 --> 03:27:24,390

Thank you so much.

03:27:28,230 --> 03:27:28,630
Thank you.

5228
03:27:29,210 --> 03:27:30,770
That's good that you're having a good time.

5229
03:27:30,910 --> 03:27:32,710
I'm not going to have a good time next week, though.

5230
03:27:32,910 --> 03:27:36,470
Because, um, I might do an Atlantis non-Nazzo Interim.

5231
03:27:41,070 --> 03:27:41,550
Um...

5232
03:27:41,550 --> 03:27:44,390
So, I might have a really bad time next week, actually.

5233
03:27:49,250 --> 03:27:49,710
Uh-oh.

5234
03:27:50,870 --> 03:27:51,810
Why do I do this?

5235
03:27:51,870 --> 03:27:52,910
An accomplishment?

5236
03:27:56,510 --> 03:27:57,790
What's so bad about it?

5237
03:27:58,110 --> 03:27:58,570
It's like...

5238
03:28:00,130 --> 03:28:01,090
It's like...

5239
03:28:01,090 --> 03:28:02,150
Peak Kusuge.

5240
03:28:02,810 --> 03:28:04,090
The game is just...

5241
03:28:04,090 --> 03:28:04,950
It's...

5242
03:28:05,050 --> 03:28:07,750
It's notoriously difficult and obtuse.

5243
03:28:08,650 --> 03:28:10,330
And love the piano in the back.

5244
03:28:10,590 --> 03:28:19,910
Yeah, we're calming down after a very stressful and crazy
game of Left 4 Dead.

5245
03:28:20,430 --> 03:28:22,030
Yes, trash NES game.

5246
03:28:22,170 --> 03:28:25,130
Exactly, it is a trash NES game, for real.

5247
03:28:26,550 --> 03:28:26,930
Which game?

5248
03:28:27,090 --> 03:28:28,510
Atlantis No Nazo.

5249
03:28:30,670 --> 03:28:33,110
I must try it.

5250
03:28:35,310 --> 03:28:37,710
I've been wanting to for so long.

5251
03:28:38,950 --> 03:28:39,510
Yeah, we're calm.

5252
03:28:40,150 --> 03:28:41,010
We're calm.

5253
03:28:41,530 --> 03:28:46,670
If you hear my voice, you are going into a trance.

5254
03:28:47,450 --> 03:28:49,050
And you will...

5255
03:28:53,030 --> 03:28:54,890
You will drink water.

5256
03:28:56,390 --> 03:28:59,050
I love it because it's the first game, Arino Challenge, and
Game Center CX.

5257
03:28:59,130 --> 03:29:00,910
That's kind of why I want to play it.

5258
03:29:01,210 --> 03:29:09,050
I saw him play it and and Korone play it.

5259
03:29:10,770 --> 03:29:15,750
And I admire Korone's endurance and skills as a gamer.

5260
03:29:16,310 --> 03:29:18,050
So it's not that I'm like...

5261
03:29:19,450 --> 03:29:21,390
How do I say this without seeing me?

5262
03:29:21,490 --> 03:29:27,390
It's like, I don't want to copy her, but I'm like, oh, she
did this challenging game.

5263
03:29:27,510 --> 03:29:28,510
I want to do it too.

5264
03:29:30,170 --> 03:29:34,070
So I'm like, I will try.

5265
03:29:35,210 --> 03:29:35,810
Yeah.

5266
03:29:37,470 --> 03:29:39,190
Yeah, I'm inspired.

5267
03:29:39,890 --> 03:29:40,790
I admire her.

5268
03:29:41,070 --> 03:29:41,890
Yeah, inspired.

5269
03:29:43,650 --> 03:29:46,070
Matara told us to give you money, so we obey.

5270
03:29:46,590 --> 03:29:48,770
Why would you listen to anything she ever says ever?

5271
03:29:49,970 --> 03:29:51,110
Finally caught you live!

5272
03:29:51,470 --> 03:29:54,250
Are you planning on replaying any of the MGS games?

5273
03:29:54,550 --> 03:29:56,130
Corky, I'm glad you asked.

5274
03:29:56,490 --> 03:29:58,930
I plan on replaying all of them!

5275
03:29:59,230 --> 03:29:59,630
Yeah!

5276
03:30:01,930 --> 03:30:04,630
Well, I'm still deciding on MGS 5.

5277
03:30:05,050 --> 03:30:07,230
Also, oh, wait, I almost said something.

5278
03:30:07,930 --> 03:30:10,570
Well, Snappy, thanks for the 10 gift.

5279
03:30:14,650 --> 03:30:21,830
Um, like the, when I, when I was, like, the last time I
played five, I was on the fence about playing it before two.

5280
03:30:22,350 --> 03:30:24,770
But I ended up playing it because I was just craving.

5281
03:30:24,990 --> 03:30:30,870
I was, I was, I was starving for the, uh, for the more Metal
Gear content.

5282
03:30:31,450 --> 03:30:34,210
So, um, hmm.

5283
03:30:36,350 --> 03:30:46,150
so i've based my personality on me anthony anthony you based
your personality on a silent protagonist

5284
03:30:50,850 --> 03:31:00,830
um but i think i think if i play v again maybe um i might do
something similar to how like with april 30th i only did the

5285
03:31:00,830 --> 03:31:08,510
skateboarding game like maybe i'll do certain missions or
something like Oh, made headband for one year win.

5286
03:31:09,690 --> 03:31:12,090
Um, didn't I have that?

5287
03:31:13,670 --> 03:31:16,950
Uh, but it, but, but YouTube erased it.

5288
03:31:17,090 --> 03:31:18,410
Um, I have to re-upload it.

Thank you for the ring!

5317
03:33:26,030 --> 03:33:26,750
Thank you!

5318
03:33:28,330 --> 03:33:29,530
Thank you so much.

5319
03:33:29,950 --> 03:33:30,610
Thank you!

5320
03:33:31,210 --> 03:33:36,530
But I really like, um, I really like the Stormtrooper
design.

5321
03:33:36,550 --> 03:33:47,050
like a long time ago I tried to get one printed for myself
I'm such a fake fan I did never even see I'm such a poser I

5322
03:33:47,050 --> 03:33:59,230
was gonna dress up as a star trooper and I wasn't even going
to I've never watched Star Wars so every time I think about

5323
03:33:59,230 --> 03:34:07,570
Star Wars I just want to watch Indiana Jones again you know
and Every time!

5324
03:34:08,090 --> 03:34:10,010
Every time I...

5325
03:34:10,010 --> 03:34:11,950
Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?

5326
03:34:12,710 --> 03:34:14,010
What are you talking about?

5327
03:34:14,330 --> 03:34:16,110
There's no height requirement?

5328
03:34:19,790 --> 03:34:21,950
Members watch along of Star Wars, please.

5329
03:34:26,690 --> 03:34:29,130
We can only... We can watch just the first three, right?

5330
03:34:31,470 --> 03:34:32,650
That was a quote.

5331
03:34:32,910 --> 03:34:34,250
That was a line from the movie.

5332
03:34:36,130 --> 03:34:36,610
Wait.

5333
03:34:37,190 --> 03:34:38,030
I'm gonna guess.

5334
03:34:38,310 --> 03:34:55,440
Does Han solo say that that's my guess is he did he did did
he say that oh no go with captain hauser he's pretty close

5335
03:34:55,440 --> 03:35:06,400
to your color it's funny because i um he was whispering the
samuel jackson story time did i use this in that video i do

5336
03:35:06,400 --> 03:35:12,920
remember that video though but i don't remember if i did
music in Oh, and welcome to membership.

5337
03:35:15,800 --> 03:35:19,640
No, I meant the first three, like, the original first three.

5338
03:35:19,780 --> 03:35:22,120
But I do kind of want to watch the prequels, too.

5339
03:35:24,100 --> 03:35:27,680
I do kind of want to watch the prequels, also, because I
don't know.

5340
03:35:27,840 --> 03:35:28,560
I want to laugh.

5341
03:35:29,000 --> 03:35:29,740
But I've seen...

5342
03:35:29,740 --> 03:35:30,320
It's so bad.

5343
03:35:30,400 --> 03:35:32,440
I've seen Plinkett's reviews on...

5344
03:35:32,440 --> 03:35:33,480
From Red Letter Media.

5345
03:35:33,640 --> 03:35:35,180
I've seen his reviews about Star Wars.

5346
03:35:36,160 --> 03:35:36,600
But...

5347
03:35:36,600 --> 03:35:38,720
I never watched anything myself.

5348
03:35:41,220 --> 03:35:46,160
Doki Bird, FPS, VTuber, Facebook, TTV, YouTube.

5349
03:35:46,540 --> 03:35:47,200
Thanks for the five gifted.

5350
03:35:47,560 --> 03:35:48,000
Thank you.

5351
03:35:50,920 --> 03:35:51,520
Be there, they come.

5352
03:35:51,740 --> 03:35:52,180
Thank you.

5353
03:35:52,840 --> 03:35:54,820
In fact, Sheperton designs the studio.

5354
03:35:54,960 --> 03:35:58,940
I mean, the original Stormtrooper suits is selling the full
suit with the helmet and the blaster.

5355
03:35:59,680 --> 03:36:00,780
How much is expensive?

5356
03:36:01,120 --> 03:36:01,700
I'm curious.

5357
03:36:04,360 --> 03:36:05,800
How much is the...

5358
03:36:06,440 --> 03:36:08,700
I clapped when I saw it.

5359
03:36:10,660 --> 03:36:18,040
never watched them but i'm watching in chronological order
is it one of those is it a series that you like okay wait so

5360
03:36:18,040 --> 03:36:24,040
it's the prequels and then like the original three movies
that were made and then

5361
03:36:27,080 --> 03:36:39,780
and then uh what was the recent ones that were made um wait
four five six one two three seven eight nine 7-8-9.

5362
03:36:40,260 --> 03:36:41,720
I thought there were just two.

5363
03:36:43,480 --> 03:36:44,060
The sequels.

5364
03:36:44,280 --> 03:36:45,120
Wait, they just call it...

5365
03:36:45,120 --> 03:36:48,020
So it's the prequels, the originals, and the sequels?

5366
03:36:56,410 --> 03:36:57,830
It's only six.

5367
03:36:58,090 --> 03:36:58,530
Ha ha.

5368
03:37:00,070 --> 03:37:00,830
Ha ha.

5369
03:37:05,710 --> 03:37:07,830
And then I have to watch...

5370
03:37:08,890 --> 03:37:10,010
The Mandalorian.

5371
03:37:10,930 --> 03:37:12,610
When does the Clone Wars happen?

5372
03:37:13,970 --> 03:37:15,290
When did I watch that?

5373
03:37:17,650 --> 03:37:26,410
I can't believe I'm surrounded by a bunch of fakes I'm sorry
clone trooper armor looks cooler I ammo especially Captain

5374
03:37:26,410 --> 03:37:43,930
Rex I'm like hold on Captain Rex oh I do like that I do like
that wait you said the the clone troopers um I don't know

5375
03:37:43,930 --> 03:37:48,150
they just don't look as I mean I think they look cool, don't
get me wrong.

5376
03:37:49,130 --> 03:37:50,970
But I think stormtroopers are cuter.

5377
03:37:54,590 --> 03:37:56,170
Yeah, I like the stormtrooper.

5378
03:37:56,770 --> 03:37:59,290
I like how his mouth is like a little triangle down.

5379
03:37:59,910 --> 03:38:00,570
It's so cute.

5380
03:38:00,810 --> 03:38:02,350
Oh wait, it's like that on the clone trooper.

5381
03:38:03,630 --> 03:38:05,430
But I also like that his head is bigger.

5382
03:38:05,890 --> 03:38:06,830
It's really wide.

5383
03:38:07,110 --> 03:38:08,550
He's got like a massive chin.

5384
03:38:11,150 --> 03:38:12,630
The helmet or the armor in general.

5385
03:38:13,950 --> 03:38:15,190
I don't really like the helmet.

5386
03:38:16,930 --> 03:38:19,130
Clone troopers have colors.

5387
03:38:19,170 --> 03:38:20,410
Clone trooper.

5388
03:38:23,050 --> 03:38:23,590
Trooper.

5389
03:38:24,870 --> 03:38:25,410
Ah!

5390
03:38:27,330 --> 03:38:30,610
The clone trooper armor looks almost the same as the
stormtrooper.

5391
03:38:30,830 --> 03:38:32,010
I should do have them side by side.

5392
03:38:32,570 --> 03:38:32,570
Storm.

5393
03:38:33,170 --> 03:38:33,610
Trooper.

5394
03:38:35,070 --> 03:38:37,150
Do you know about the Ewoks?

5395
03:38:37,350 --> 03:38:38,730
Are those the ones that go...

5396
03:38:38,730 --> 03:38:39,630
Rrrr!

5397
03:38:41,210 --> 03:38:41,750
Rrrr!

5398
03:38:42,270 --> 03:38:42,750
Hold on.

5399
03:38:42,910 --> 03:38:43,150
Hold on.

5400
03:38:43,150 --> 03:38:43,610
I got this.

5401
03:38:44,310 --> 03:38:44,730
Rrrr!

5402
03:38:56,990 --> 03:38:58,910
Hold on.

5403
03:38:59,730 --> 03:39:01,530
Oh, that was pretty good.

5404
03:39:01,650 --> 03:39:06,310
That was pretty good.

5405
03:39:13,860 --> 03:39:16,080
That's a wookie.

5406
03:39:17,820 --> 03:39:18,360
Wookie.

5407
03:39:19,360 --> 03:39:20,480
Wait, so what you?

5408
03:39:21,320 --> 03:39:21,480
Oh!

5409
03:39:24,040 --> 03:39:24,560
Ewok.

5410
03:39:27,260 --> 03:39:27,600
Oh!

5411
03:39:28,020 --> 03:39:30,600
Oh my god, they look like my old dog.

5412
03:39:31,540 --> 03:39:31,960
What?

5413
03:39:32,640 --> 03:39:34,580
I don't know if I like that.

5414
03:39:34,720 --> 03:39:35,900
Because I didn't like that dog.

5415
03:39:37,180 --> 03:39:39,160
It was really my mom's dog.

5416
03:39:41,440 --> 03:39:48,120
Star Wars only becomes watchable as an adult when you
realize that the Jedi are crocked Crooked cops and Luke

5417
03:39:48,120 --> 03:39:49,760
Skywalker was an android slave.

5418
03:39:49,880 --> 03:39:50,960
Oh, what is going on?

5419
03:39:51,360 --> 03:39:51,360
What?

5420
03:39:53,840 --> 03:39:54,780
Jawas are cute.

5421
03:39:55,800 --> 03:39:56,380
Jawas.

5422
03:39:57,840 --> 03:39:58,260
Oh!

5423
03:39:58,560 --> 03:40:01,220
Oh my gosh, they look just like...

5424
03:40:01,220 --> 03:40:03,260
They just look like...

5425
03:40:03,260 --> 03:40:04,460
The stab guys!

5426
03:40:05,040 --> 03:40:06,060
Final... The Tom...

5427
03:40:07,280 --> 03:40:08,040
Tom...

5428
03:40:09,900 --> 03:40:10,660
Tomberry?

5429
03:40:13,060 --> 03:40:13,820
Tonberry!

5430
03:40:14,560 --> 03:40:15,940
They look just like a Tonberry!

5431
03:40:19,180 --> 03:40:21,680
They look so cute, the Jawas.

5432
03:40:22,280 --> 03:40:26,000
Oh my gosh, even the plushies of them are so cute.

5433
03:40:27,540 --> 03:40:28,820
Oh, they're so, so cute.

5434
03:40:31,200 --> 03:40:32,840
Taunbury's from Final Fantasy.

5435
03:40:38,980 --> 03:40:39,840
I like them.

5436
03:40:40,480 --> 03:40:43,800
I have to, wait, what did you say about, they make a funny
noise too?

5437
03:40:44,260 --> 03:40:44,960
The Jawas?

5438
03:40:46,960 --> 03:40:47,960
sound like.

5439
03:40:49,940 --> 03:40:51,980
Jabba the Hut is really... I know that guy.

5440
03:40:53,100 --> 03:40:53,880
I know that guy.

5441
03:40:54,000 --> 03:40:57,580
He's the one that's... that enslaves Leia.

5442
03:41:01,080 --> 03:41:01,580
Uttini!

5443
03:41:03,340 --> 03:41:03,840
Uttini!

5444
03:41:05,540 --> 03:41:06,160
Please look.

5445
03:41:06,200 --> 03:41:07,300
I know Jabba the Hut.

5446
03:41:10,620 --> 03:41:14,000
I always thought that this guy was, um...

5447
03:41:16,060 --> 03:41:23,280
Emperor, Emperor, Emperor, Emperor, Emperor, hold on, no,
no, no, Emperor Palpatine.

5448
03:41:23,780 --> 03:41:33,900
I thought it was Emperor, Emperor Palpatine.

5449
03:41:36,560 --> 03:41:38,720
Stop making fun of me.

5450
03:41:43,750 --> 03:41:47,390
Emperor, Emperor Palpatine.

5451
03:41:48,590 --> 03:41:50,910
They look kind of similar, I think.

5452
03:41:51,490 --> 03:41:54,310
It's just kind of, they're both really wrinkly.

5453
03:41:54,610 --> 03:41:55,970
I think that's why it was.

5454
03:41:56,250 --> 03:41:57,150
I'm Pupapapap.

5455
03:41:57,310 --> 03:41:59,010
Stop making fun of me.

5456
03:42:05,930 --> 03:42:07,430
That's an old man.

5457
03:42:08,750 --> 03:42:09,570
One's an old man.

5458
03:42:09,710 --> 03:42:10,530
One's a slug.

5459
03:42:11,430 --> 03:42:12,210
Close enough.

5460
03:42:15,830 --> 03:42:17,490
And he talks like this.

5461
03:42:17,970 --> 03:42:19,110
I'm Pupapapapap.

5462
03:42:19,270 --> 03:42:20,330
Okay, I did it again.

5463
03:42:21,690 --> 03:42:23,730
What's wrong with me?

5464
03:42:23,890 --> 03:42:25,370
Marrow, welcome to membership.

5465
03:42:25,990 --> 03:42:27,790
I'm Emperor Palpatine.

5466
03:42:30,470 --> 03:42:32,830
He says, do it.

5467
03:42:35,190 --> 03:42:36,490
Do it.

5468
03:42:39,450 --> 03:42:41,870
It's like he's really here.

5469
03:42:42,110 --> 03:42:43,450
Do it.

5470
03:42:45,070 --> 03:42:45,790
Do it.

5471
03:42:48,350 --> 03:42:51,010
Palpatine is wife material, to be honest.

5472
03:42:55,840 --> 03:42:58,040
Is it like a gap moe?

5473
03:42:59,680 --> 03:43:00,640
Minter, you okay.

5474
03:43:01,040 --> 03:43:03,580
No, I think Leopard Dead really took a lot out of me.

5475
03:43:04,500 --> 03:43:08,140
I think Leopard Dead really took a chunk out of my brain.

5476
03:43:15,970 --> 03:43:16,670
Hold on.

5477
03:43:29,730 --> 03:43:30,370
Hold on.

5478
03:43:30,410 --> 03:43:31,650
I'm finding a good emote.

5479
03:43:31,890 --> 03:43:32,330
There we go.

5480
03:43:35,190 --> 03:43:35,550
Cute.

5481
03:43:38,330 --> 03:43:39,210
I'm embarrassed.

5482
03:43:40,430 --> 03:43:41,230
Okay, I'm embarrassed.

5483
03:43:42,110 --> 03:43:44,410
I'm embarrassed that I cannot speak properly.

5484
03:43:45,070 --> 03:43:46,770
I need to go to enunciation classes.

5485
03:43:47,290 --> 03:43:52,530
Actually, I've been really thinking recently how much I want
to take improv classes.

5486
03:43:54,470 --> 03:43:55,590
I've been thinking...

5487
03:43:56,670 --> 03:43:58,430
Zionia, look at the membership, thank you.

5488
03:43:58,990 --> 03:44:01,070
I've been thinking about how I want to do...

5489
03:44:01,070 --> 03:44:04,290
I did improv classes as a kid because I took a lot of...

5490
03:44:04,290 --> 03:44:06,830
I did like acting classes, I did dance.

5491
03:44:06,910 --> 03:44:07,530
I went to...

5492
03:44:07,590 --> 03:44:19,630
a school of the arts basically and so i um uh i was there
for like years um but i want to get back into improv for

5493
03:44:19,630 --> 03:44:27,070
like you know sometimes i like watch improv stuff and i'm
like how are they so quick how are they so witty you know

5494
03:44:27,070 --> 03:44:37,110
it's like oh my gosh i really want to and i like try to
consume a bunch of different kind of media and like you know

5495
03:44:37,110 --> 03:44:43,930
i know tick tock gets hated on a bunch but like honestly
because of how short form tick tock is and how much i'm

5496
03:44:43,930 --> 03:44:53,090
consuming like i'm watching i'm watching skits i'm watching
facts i'm watching dumb stuff like i'm able to like absorb

5497
03:44:53,090 --> 03:45:02,390
so many different topics within such a short amount of time
that it actually like i feel like it helps me drop out tv is

5498
03:45:02,390 --> 03:45:11,010
the who whose line i've been watching so much dropout oh my
gosh game changer is like the funniest show it's so good

5499
03:45:11,010 --> 03:45:21,590
like they man they saved college humor like dang game
changer is if you haven't watched it before it's so funny

5500
03:45:21,590 --> 03:45:36,390
it's really really good um but i've been here the whole time
it used to be called humor and then they um they changed it

5501
03:45:36,390 --> 03:45:47,090
but i watch i watch i only watch game changer and um
actually i only watch those two brendan is my wife they're

5502
03:45:47,090 --> 03:45:57,390
they're really good um konen o'brien recently released a
podcast video with dr arroyo it's like a whole improv video

5503
03:45:57,390 --> 03:46:04,710
a podcast one i will watch it konen o'brien is also just a
comedic genius.

5504
03:46:06,290 --> 03:46:09,150
There's so many comedians, so many people that are just so
witty.

5505
03:46:09,390 --> 03:46:12,410
I'm like, man, I need to, I want to study.

5506
03:46:13,090 --> 03:46:20,930
But it's also like, it's also just like, at the same time,
it's, it's, it's, what's the word?

5507
03:46:22,070 --> 03:46:24,110
It's like not overthinking stuff, you know?

5508
03:46:24,270 --> 03:46:31,170
You have to just be able to, if you overthink it, then you
can't pull it out of your, out of your brain so fast.

5509
03:46:31,890 --> 03:46:35,690
Sorry if this is talked about before, but I'm curious if
you've ever played the early Kojima game, Snatcher.

5510
03:46:36,570 --> 03:46:37,790
If not, you play as a police detective.

5511
03:46:37,930 --> 03:46:39,350
I know a lot about Snatcher.

5512
03:46:40,230 --> 03:46:40,530
Dude.

5513
03:46:40,890 --> 03:46:42,270
2-2-0-7-2.

5514
03:46:42,470 --> 03:46:43,590
Thank you for the super chat, by the way.

5515
03:46:44,570 --> 03:46:47,030
Actually, I do intend on playing Snatcher.

5516
03:46:49,450 --> 03:46:51,050
I own police knots.

5517
03:46:51,150 --> 03:46:52,290
I don't own Snatcher.

5518
03:46:53,870 --> 03:46:58,210
But I would love to play Snatcher for sure.

5519
03:46:58,430 --> 03:47:00,190
But also, I would have to get it in English.

5520
03:47:00,530 --> 03:47:02,950
You know, I would have to get it, like, translated and stuff
like that.

5521
03:47:03,350 --> 03:47:04,850
But I really do want to play it.

5522
03:47:05,770 --> 03:47:06,550
Yes, yes, yes.

5523
03:47:07,950 --> 03:47:09,070
Conan's an actual genius, too.

5524
03:47:09,190 --> 03:47:10,110
He graduated from Harvard.

5525
03:47:10,390 --> 03:47:10,610
Yeah.

5526
03:47:11,510 --> 03:47:12,430
You've got to be smart.

5527
03:47:12,630 --> 03:47:14,230
You've got to be quick on your feet.

5528
03:47:15,070 --> 03:47:15,130
Hmm.

5529
03:47:16,910 --> 03:47:17,190
So.

5530
03:47:20,210 --> 03:47:20,690
Hmm.

5531
03:47:23,290 --> 03:47:23,770
Um.

5532
03:47:24,650 --> 03:47:25,770
It's not sure I was an English release.

5533
03:47:25,830 --> 03:47:26,230
It does?

5534
03:47:26,970 --> 03:47:29,410
Wait, why was I looking for it in Japan every time?

5535
03:47:29,890 --> 03:47:30,850
Oh, the Sega...

5536
03:47:30,850 --> 03:47:31,990
Yes, the Sega CD.

5537
03:47:33,350 --> 03:47:39,130
Yes, I, that's why, okay, I do remember that's why I was
struggling because that's why it's so expensive.

5538
03:47:39,650 --> 03:47:41,210
Thanks, slow beef.

5539
03:47:42,090 --> 03:47:42,630
That guy.

5540
03:47:42,790 --> 03:47:44,190
Internet dude, welcome to Bamboo Show.

5541
03:47:44,810 --> 03:47:45,610
Which version of Snatcher?

5542
03:47:45,770 --> 03:47:46,170
There's several.

5543
03:47:46,310 --> 03:47:48,090
They all have meaningful differences.

5544
03:47:48,670 --> 03:47:50,710
I recommend SD Snatcher personally.

5545
03:47:51,450 --> 03:47:51,530
Oh.

5546
03:47:52,690 --> 03:47:54,050
Wait, what's the difference?

5547
03:47:56,510 --> 03:47:58,890
Also, Skeleton, I love your cat.

5548
03:48:00,430 --> 03:48:01,950
Post more of your cat.

5549
03:48:03,350 --> 03:48:11,650
very expensive getting it though and i don't have a uh i
don't have i might actually have to emulate it to be honest

5550
03:48:11,650 --> 03:48:24,370
but i could do that now i can i could do that so um uh yeah
usually i like to um i don't know i feel more authentic if i

5551
03:48:24,370 --> 03:48:30,910
play things as they originally were like you know how i
played twin snakes with my actual game cube and stuff like

5552
03:48:30,910 --> 03:48:34,570
that Thank you for the five gift.

5553
03:48:34,990 --> 03:48:36,990
I feel bad calling you that.

5554
03:48:37,470 --> 03:48:38,130
Mike Tyson.

5555
03:48:41,250 --> 03:48:42,490
Thank you for the five gift.

5556
03:48:43,010 --> 03:48:43,670
Thank you.

5557
03:48:50,410 --> 03:48:51,930
Mr. Rass.

5558
03:48:56,750 --> 03:48:57,390
Um.

5559
03:48:58,790 --> 03:48:59,490
But yeah.

5560
03:49:01,510 --> 03:49:02,850
Don't call him that.

5561
03:49:03,430 --> 03:49:03,910
Sorry.

5562
03:49:08,170 --> 03:49:12,270
Sega City is hard to set up, and Sega has been cool with
emulation.

5563
03:49:12,590 --> 03:49:13,050
Oh, okay.

5564
03:49:15,570 --> 03:49:16,690
That's good to know.

5565
03:49:17,130 --> 03:49:19,830
Because I don't even have a way to...

5566
03:49:19,830 --> 03:49:21,430
Like, I would have to...

5567
03:49:21,430 --> 03:49:28,930
I haven't looked into even a way, like, to port the console
onto my computer, you know?

5568
03:49:31,250 --> 03:49:32,870
Divert, thank you.

5569
03:49:33,350 --> 03:49:38,470
If the notification for this doesn't show, you can call me a
simp direct- Yo, oh wait.

5570
03:49:39,810 --> 03:49:40,690
Which one was that?

5571
03:49:42,410 --> 03:49:44,430
I think there's more than one.

5572
03:49:52,150 --> 03:49:55,870
Having a list actually made me think about what I can do and
want to do.

5573
03:49:56,170 --> 03:49:57,470
A summer list was a good idea.

5574
03:49:57,930 --> 03:49:58,630
I'm glad!

5575
03:50:01,910 --> 03:50:03,330
Have you watched very important people?

5576
03:50:03,650 --> 03:50:04,090
It's so funny.

5577
03:50:04,190 --> 03:50:04,750
I have not.

5578
03:50:05,310 --> 03:50:06,450
I have not, I have not.

5579
03:50:07,430 --> 03:50:10,850
I think actually, wait, are the donuts actually backed up?

5580
03:50:11,070 --> 03:50:12,270
I'm confused now.

5581
03:50:14,290 --> 03:50:17,350
Maybe they don't show on the screen, but they do actually
get backed up.

5582
03:50:19,130 --> 03:50:19,470
Hmm.

5583
03:50:20,710 --> 03:50:21,670
Interesting, interesting.

5584
03:50:22,010 --> 03:50:22,770
They seem to be.

5585
03:50:23,270 --> 03:50:24,770
Yeah, because I see yours too, Vera.

5586
03:50:26,010 --> 03:50:27,210
Good luck on the karaoke relay.

5587
03:50:27,350 --> 03:50:28,110
It's such a stacked event.

5588
03:50:28,170 --> 03:50:28,510
Have fun.

5589
03:50:28,970 --> 03:50:30,350
Yeah, I'm still, I'll be honest.

5590
03:50:30,430 --> 03:50:32,710
I'm still trying to, uh...

5591
03:50:32,710 --> 03:50:36,110
I'm still trying to think of what songs I want to sing.

5592
03:50:38,290 --> 03:50:48,850
but um maybe you'll like very important people oh by dropout
oh it's by dropout if you want more improv ah interesting

5593
03:50:48,850 --> 03:51:01,010
interesting the summer list that you would do a existential
crisis why it's just thinking of stuff you want to do it

5594
03:51:01,010 --> 03:51:08,570
doesn't have to be like a goal list or anything it can be
just like I want to I want to I want to eat a hamburger.

5595
03:51:09,430 --> 03:51:11,650
I want to grill my own hamburger.

5596
03:51:16,330 --> 03:51:23,450
I think I have an idea for what I want to do for the karaoke
thing, but I'm also kind of like

5597
03:51:27,290 --> 03:51:33,450
mmmmmmmmm like, I don't know.

5598
03:51:35,110 --> 03:51:37,570
I don't want to be that person is all.

5599
03:51:39,390 --> 03:51:42,090
Because I wanted to do like all Metal Gear songs.

5600
03:51:43,610 --> 03:51:46,110
But, and have it, like, kind of Metal Gear themed, but...

5601
03:51:48,210 --> 03:51:49,210
Um, I don't know.

5602
03:51:49,750 --> 03:51:52,010
People have asked for, like, a Metal Gear karaoke.

5603
03:51:52,590 --> 03:51:55,350
I'd totally be down for that, but...

5604
03:51:55,350 --> 03:51:56,490
There's honestly not that many.

5605
03:51:57,350 --> 03:51:57,910
Haruka!

5606
03:51:58,350 --> 03:51:58,930
Thank you!

5607
03:51:59,530 --> 03:52:00,030
Hamburg!

5608
03:52:00,470 --> 03:52:00,810
Thank you!

5609
03:52:04,050 --> 03:52:04,610
Hmm.

5610
03:52:07,450 --> 03:52:08,490
Do it.

5611
03:52:08,510 --> 03:52:09,210
Do it.

5612
03:52:10,370 --> 03:52:11,050
Oh, man.

5613
03:52:11,070 --> 03:52:12,510
Metal Gear Rising does have a lot of songs.

5614
03:52:12,650 --> 03:52:13,250
I guess that's true.

5615
03:52:13,910 --> 03:52:15,870
I was always thinking of Metal Gear Solid.

5616
03:52:17,310 --> 03:52:17,850
Instead of a...

5617
03:52:17,850 --> 03:52:19,110
How long is each person's segment?

5618
03:52:19,310 --> 03:52:22,070
About 20 minutes, so...

5619
03:52:23,290 --> 03:52:31,070
That's why I was just like, well, you know, if someone's
just like, wow, maybe Mint is kind of cool, we have to know

5620
03:52:31,070 --> 03:52:34,190
the brain rot that they're getting into as well.

5621
03:52:36,790 --> 03:52:38,390
Just a little bit, maybe.

5622
03:52:39,970 --> 03:52:41,050
And also, even though...

5623
03:52:41,070 --> 03:52:45,090
Even though it's Metal Gear songs, they're still good songs,
so...

5624
03:52:45,090 --> 03:52:47,070
It's not that they're bad songs.

5625
03:52:49,130 --> 03:52:50,290
Only Limp Biscuit.

5626
03:52:51,810 --> 03:52:56,530
It's another improv show where they take comedians and put
them in costumes and makeup, and they improv their way

5627
03:52:56,530 --> 03:52:59,030
through the interview with Vic Michaelis.

5628
03:53:00,070 --> 03:53:01,170
It's so funny to see their improv.

5629
03:53:01,310 --> 03:53:02,170
Also, good luck with karaoke.

5630
03:53:02,350 --> 03:53:03,010
Thank you!

5631
03:53:03,850 --> 03:53:05,110
All the licensed songs.

5632
03:53:05,390 --> 03:53:05,750
Oh!

5633
03:53:06,650 --> 03:53:07,910
That's kind of fun, right?

5634
03:53:09,210 --> 03:53:11,050
Where it's, like, technically Metal Gear songs.

5635
03:53:11,070 --> 03:53:13,230
Have you played Death Stranding?

5636
03:53:13,370 --> 03:53:15,290
Actually, I was just thinking about that.

5637
03:53:15,410 --> 03:53:15,810
Oh my gosh.

5638
03:53:16,170 --> 03:53:22,930
I was just thinking about how I was like, man, I think I
will start playing more Death Stranding in my off time.

5639
03:53:23,570 --> 03:53:30,610
I say more, but I haven't touched it in a long time, but I
have definitely been thinking about it.

5640
03:53:33,330 --> 03:53:42,030
Take on me, take on me, take me home, take on me.

5641
03:53:42,670 --> 03:53:47,790
I'll be home in a day or two.

5642
03:53:56,200 --> 03:53:57,860
Strangling is an experience.

5643
03:53:58,660 --> 03:53:59,220
Wait, it's home?

5644
03:54:00,380 --> 03:54:01,440
Oh, I don't know.

5645
03:54:03,120 --> 03:54:03,840
Take.

5646
03:54:04,780 --> 03:54:06,380
Take on me lyrics.

5647
03:54:08,920 --> 03:54:09,480
Take on.

5648
03:54:09,580 --> 03:54:14,240
Oh, I'll be gone in a day or two.

5649
03:54:15,380 --> 03:54:16,800
I need water.

5650
03:54:17,080 --> 03:54:21,260
I've been out of I've been out of water for like two hours
now.

5651
03:54:31,580 --> 03:54:35,820
There's an English patch for police nots and options for
either PS version or Sega Saturn.

5652
03:54:36,460 --> 03:54:38,280
Oh, I will look into it.

5653
03:54:38,860 --> 03:54:41,240
Though I don't know much about emulation stuff.

5654
03:54:41,720 --> 03:54:43,060
So, um, it might...

5655
03:54:43,060 --> 03:54:44,320
Oh my gosh, they're so behind.

5656
03:54:44,400 --> 03:54:45,360
They just don't show up.

5657
03:54:45,820 --> 03:54:47,720
Oh my gosh, there's Mataras, Membo's...

5658
03:54:47,820 --> 03:54:55,580

5660
03:55:09,490 --> 03:55:21,850

midnight i might actually head out in about five minutes so

5661
03:55:21,850 --> 03:55:24,010
that I can get rest for tomorrow.

5662
03:55:27,090 --> 03:55:27,970
And, um...

5663
03:55:27,970 --> 03:55:28,470
Hmm.

5664
03:55:31,630 --> 03:55:32,070
Yeah.

5665
03:55:33,050 --> 03:55:34,170
Why do I have so many messages?

5666
03:55:34,370 --> 03:55:34,450
Oh.

5667
03:55:37,050 --> 03:55:37,490
Nice.

5668
03:55:38,410 --> 03:55:40,030
Oh my gosh, wait, I have so many messages.

5669
03:55:40,290 --> 03:55:41,810
Okay, I have stuff to do tonight.

5670
03:55:43,930 --> 03:55:45,210
Matta played Halo recently.

5671
03:55:45,370 --> 03:55:45,810
Fancy trying.

5672
03:55:45,910 --> 03:55:46,590
Oh, yes.

5673
03:55:46,650 --> 03:55:47,930
Actually, we talked about that earlier.

5674
03:55:48,670 --> 03:55:49,110
Um...

5675
03:55:49,190 --> 03:55:50,030
And yes.

5676
03:55:50,390 --> 03:55:51,390
I am interested.

5677
03:55:51,950 --> 03:55:57,670
I just have to... I have to just do it.

5678
03:55:58,670 --> 03:56:01,210
I was kind of like, though, I was kind of like...

5679
03:56:03,190 --> 03:56:07,650
I don't... Halo is one of those series that... Like, kind of
like...

5680
03:56:08,070 --> 03:56:11,190
With Metal Gear, I was overwhelmed by...

5681
03:56:13,010 --> 03:56:15,190
I was overwhelmed by...

5682
03:56:16,570 --> 03:56:18,730
Where to start and everything.

5683
03:56:19,630 --> 03:56:23,510
Um, now I feel that way with Halo, you know?

5684
03:56:27,470 --> 03:56:28,210
Good night, Mint.

5685
03:56:28,350 --> 03:56:29,190
Thanks for the stream today.

5686
03:56:29,750 --> 03:56:30,110
Good night!

5687
03:56:32,430 --> 03:56:34,610
No, it's not that I dislike FPS.

5688
03:56:35,190 --> 03:56:36,730
I actually very much like FPS.

5689
03:56:36,910 --> 03:56:39,350
I'm not good at FPS, but I like it.

5690
03:56:40,570 --> 03:56:41,490
I like it.

5691
03:56:41,550 --> 03:56:43,350
I'm just, I'm not good at it, but I think it's fine.

5692
03:56:44,270 --> 03:56:44,690
Mm-hmm.

5693
03:56:46,390 --> 03:56:46,790
Yeah.

5694
03:56:47,230 --> 03:56:47,630
Yeah.

5695
03:56:49,190 --> 03:56:50,430
Sorry, we overwhelmed you.

5696
03:56:50,570 --> 03:56:51,670
No, it's not you guys.

5697
03:56:51,910 --> 03:56:57,490
It's overwhelming for me to know where do I start, you know?

5698
03:56:57,930 --> 03:57:00,630
So once I'm to that point, though, I will ask.

5699
03:57:01,010 --> 03:57:05,130
Once I'm to the point of saying, like, hey, I'm ready to
play.

5700
03:57:05,550 --> 03:57:07,190
I'm ready to play...

5701
03:57:08,150 --> 03:57:10,190
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

5702
03:57:11,190 --> 03:57:13,650
Ready to play, I almost said Metal Gear.

5703
03:57:13,750 --> 03:57:14,430
Uh, Halo.

5704
03:57:14,890 --> 03:57:15,510
Then I will.

5705
03:57:16,130 --> 03:57:16,390
Yeah.

5706
03:57:17,330 --> 03:57:18,970
Release order is always a good way.

5707
03:57:19,190 --> 03:57:21,030
What, so just start at Halo 1?

5708
03:57:23,470 --> 03:57:24,230
My aim is good?

5709
03:57:24,410 --> 03:57:25,270
You think so?

5710
03:57:27,410 --> 03:57:28,830
You think so?

5711
03:57:29,630 --> 03:57:30,590
Oh my gosh.

5712
03:57:31,150 --> 03:57:33,150
It's like the first time anyone has ever said that to me.

5713
03:57:33,550 --> 03:57:34,450
My aim is good.

5714
03:57:35,130 --> 03:57:37,110
Do you think I'm a gamer for real?

5715
03:57:38,730 --> 03:57:41,290
This is maybe the best day of my life.

5716
03:57:42,330 --> 03:57:42,930
Oh my gosh.

5717
03:57:44,250 --> 03:57:45,250
I have a good aim.

5718
03:57:54,560 --> 03:58:08,360
I mean, someone in this room, and I mean, there's only one
ghost, some ghost in this room had the best headshot

5719
03:58:08,360 --> 03:58:11,620
accuracy, and I'm not, my hands are up.

5720
03:58:13,440 --> 03:58:20,860
Hands are up, I mean, Halo is my second favorite series of
all time, Seeking Mata and now Mint talking about its

5721
03:58:20,860 --> 03:58:21,840
overwhelming brain.

5722
03:58:25,260 --> 03:58:26,700
Stand proud, Mint.

5723
03:58:27,080 --> 03:58:28,100
You are a gamer.

5724
03:58:29,360 --> 03:58:30,920
Your hands are always up.

5725
03:58:40,270 --> 03:58:42,790
I mean, my hands are up.

5726
03:58:44,910 --> 03:58:46,190
What about Splinter Cell?

5727
03:58:46,330 --> 03:58:48,110
I have thought about Splinter Cell.

5728
03:58:48,870 --> 03:58:56,910
But truly, honestly, from what I heard, like, I don't like
stealth games.

5729
03:58:57,530 --> 03:59:02,870
I don't like stealth games, and what kept me going with
Metal Gear is the story.

5730
03:59:03,770 --> 03:59:07,570
And so knowing that the story, I've heard that the story for
Splinter...

5731
03:59:07,570 --> 03:59:12,970
You can correct me if I'm wrong, but I've heard that the
story for Splinter Cell is just kind of...

5732
03:59:14,170 --> 03:59:19,250
But also is, like, more stealthy than Metal Gear.

5733
03:59:24,140 --> 03:59:24,580
Right?

5734
03:59:24,900 --> 03:59:25,660
Am I wrong?

5735
03:59:26,540 --> 03:59:27,600
Metal Gear's a stealth game?

5736
03:59:27,900 --> 03:59:28,420
Yeah.

5737
03:59:29,740 --> 03:59:30,740
Down to play Devil May Cry?

5738
03:59:30,940 --> 03:59:31,080
Yep.

5739
03:59:32,160 --> 03:59:33,200
I am.

5740
03:59:34,500 --> 03:59:35,540
Tom Clancy.

5741
03:59:36,400 --> 03:59:37,220
Who is that guy?

5742
03:59:37,460 --> 03:59:38,920
I know it's Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.

5743
03:59:39,100 --> 03:59:39,580
You know what?

5744
03:59:39,600 --> 03:59:42,200
You would probably never believe this, but a long time ago.

5745
03:59:42,480 --> 03:59:44,600
I don't remember how I acquired this.

5746
03:59:44,900 --> 03:59:51,300
But I used to have a full Splinter Cell standee in my room.

5747
03:59:53,520 --> 03:59:55,180
Never having played it.

5748
03:59:56,100 --> 03:59:58,020
Not knowing anything about it.

5749
03:59:59,740 --> 04:00:01,620
I don't remember how I acquired it.

5750
04:00:01,900 --> 04:00:05,520
Let me see if I can find, like, okay, if I look up Splinter
Cell.

5751
04:00:06,060 --> 04:00:08,360
If I can see, like, what the image was.

5752
04:00:15,900 --> 04:00:16,940
Maybe if I look...

5753
04:00:16,940 --> 04:00:18,360
I wonder if I look up Standy.

5754
04:00:18,580 --> 04:00:20,140
I wonder if I can even find it from that.

5755
04:00:20,940 --> 04:00:22,800
If I can find, like, a similar one.

5756
04:00:24,860 --> 04:00:25,740
What the hell?

5757
04:00:27,240 --> 04:00:27,640
What?

5758
04:00:28,880 --> 04:00:29,660
Oh, my God.

5759
04:00:29,740 --> 04:00:30,580
What?

5760
04:00:31,040 --> 04:00:31,980
Wait, what?

5761
04:00:32,400 --> 04:00:33,620
I just, okay, wait, what?

5762
04:00:34,380 --> 04:00:36,060
I just looked up in Google.

5763
04:00:36,700 --> 04:00:37,840
Splinter Cell Stand-E.

5764
04:00:38,360 --> 04:00:40,320
And this is what appeared.

5765
04:00:41,540 --> 04:00:42,660
This is what appeared.

5766
04:00:46,690 --> 04:00:47,010
Me!

5767
04:00:53,300 --> 04:00:55,170
Why am I here?

5768
04:01:00,330 --> 04:01:03,270

Set it up to react to donos.

No one will donate again.

5800
04:04:47,230 --> 04:04:49,830
No one will ever want to send anything ever again.

5801
04:04:51,810 --> 04:04:53,550
Oh, you mean clapper.

5802

5803
04:04:57,710 --> 04:04:58,310
No.

5804
04:05:01,670 --> 04:05:02,150
Wow.

5805
04:05:05,130 --> 04:05:07,090
No pipe bombs that have off-kite gifts.

5806
04:05:08,330 --> 04:05:10,970
Oh my gosh, you give me a gift and you're like, check your
inventory.

5807
04:05:12,250 --> 04:05:19,210
It's like when Acelot leaves the bomb in my inventory.

5808
04:05:21,110 --> 04:05:21,850
Ghost of Mint!

5809
04:05:22,310 --> 04:05:22,890
Thanks for the stream.

5810
04:05:22,910 --> 04:05:24,490
Work has been brutal the past few weeks.

5811
04:05:24,610 --> 04:05:25,490
New micromanager.

5812
04:05:25,910 --> 04:05:26,610
Oh no.

5813
04:05:27,630 --> 04:05:28,730
Changes in work environment, etc.

5814
04:05:28,730 --> 04:05:32,950
So this was my much-needed dopamine to start the weekend.

5815
04:05:34,690 --> 04:05:34,990
Otsuminto!

5816

Otsuminto!

5819
04:05:38,650 --> 04:05:40,250
Full bomb in my pocket.

5820
04:05:41,210 --> 04:05:45,990
You hand me a package and it's like beeping and you're just
like, here you go!
