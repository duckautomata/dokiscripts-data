1
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,280
Coffee.

2
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,200
Can.

3
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,240
A.

4
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,820
S.

5
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:18,960
M.

6
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,440
R.

7
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,810
Am I dreaming?

8
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,390
No, Chibi?

9
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,450
Would you prefer that?

10
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
I'm big again.

11
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,470
I'll be honest, I'm not used to this.

12
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,470
I think I got so used to Chibi Minto.

13
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,950
It was hard going back.

14
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,850
It was hard going back!

15
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,450
I'm big!

16
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,650
I got coffee.

17
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,090
It's my first coffee of the day.

18
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,350
You're big.

19
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,270
Welcome back, Minto!

20
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,030
Thank you!

21
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,610
Thank you!

22
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,270
Thank you!

23
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,290
Thank you!

24
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,290
Coffee.

25
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,130
Big Boss Minto.

26
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,370
Big sippin'.

27
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,330
Why are her hands like that?

28
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,090
Which parts specifically are big again?

29
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,350
My heart.

30
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,750
And my brain.

31
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,010
Rhys, thanks for the gift!

32
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,050
Do you need to tweet?

33
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:01,970
Oh, thank you!

34
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,910
Oh my gosh.

35
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,950
I forgot to tweet.

36
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,450
Oh, I also forgot to do something else.

37
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:06,870
Sorry.

38
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,250
Hold on.

39
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,460
Uh, tweet.

40
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,180
Haaunting now.

41
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,120
She's so good at this, you guys.

42
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,960
Professional streamer.

43
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,640
I am...

44
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:38,960
Indy!

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,980
Yeah, anyway.

46
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,320
One year of experience.

47
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,040
One year of experience!

48
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,980
My best coin run was 9.9 million with ASCII on stage 3 hard.

49
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,840
9.9 million coins.

50
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,060
9.9 million coins.

51
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,380
I don't think I have any coins.

52
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,380
I have 500 coins.

53
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,260
I have 500 coins.

54
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,910
100 more years.

55
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,810
You get paid for this, so automatically a pro.

56
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,530
That's not how that...

57
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,430
That's not how that works.

58
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,860
You're expecting too much.

59
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,060
Hahaha.

60
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,340
Hahaha.

61
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,580
A professional is someone who has a master's degree.

62
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,030
Probably.

63
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:01,450
They have published a scientific paper on the field.

64
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,370
Hi Yamato.

65
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,430
I'm paying you for your labor.

66
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,070
Congrats, you're a professional now.

67
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,510
I've never once participated in a tournament.

68
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,710
How can I be a professional?

69
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,790
Taking a big test tomorrow and haven't caught any streams recently.

70
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,130
As a result, unfortunately...

71
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,870
Amelia!

72
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,250
You got this!

73
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,030
You've got this in your big brain.

74
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:25,850
Paycheck.

75
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:27,750
Oh.

76
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,770
WrestleTuber?

77
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,230
No,

78
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,820
I was a host.

79
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,060
I was...

80
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,460
I was helping host.

81
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,180
I casted.

82
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,920
Yeah, that's not...

83
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,900
That's different.

84
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,930
You guys, I got Saina.

85
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,360
Howdy, professional streamer.

86
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,180
Good luck, Amelia!

87
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,220
Big.

88
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,920
Did you see that scientific paper on the toxicity of Ayame and Nakiri's hordes?

89
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,020
Wait...

90
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,960
Is that real?

91
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,920
Is that real?

92
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,640
I want to play Saina.

93
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,620
Is it okay?

94
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,940
Is it okay?

95
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,660
People last time said Saina was probably like my type of play.

96
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,410
Well, of course, keep talking.

97
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,310
I want to go to the Halloween castle.

98
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,590
Tobe.

99
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,170
You can start with reason.

100
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:55,750
Oh!

101
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:55,870
Oh!

102
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,010
Risu for coin farm!

103
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,570
Yes!

104
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,330
Yes, I've heard that Risu is so good for coins.

105
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,930
But you need to buy 4 out of 5 weapon limiter in the shop.

106
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,330
You can still get 100k coins of one brand on stage 1.

107
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,010
What?

108
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,650
No way...

109
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,310
Wait, I saw... I heard... I heard...

110
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,430
Marilyn, thank you!

111
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,170
Happy birthday to Mari from Blue Archive.

112
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,790
Yes, happy birthday to Mari from Blue Archive.

113
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,490
Let's see... Oh!

114
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,670
Do you hear my cat?

115
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,770
Do you want outpies?

116
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,910
I think she wants to leave.

117
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,610
Okay, hold on.

118
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,090
Give me a second.

119
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,170
Let me let my cat out.

120
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:39,650
Hi!

121
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,780
Usually she likes to stay.

122
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,960
Okay, um...

123
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,720
Maybe we should do Risu then.

124
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,420
I also got Risu.

125
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,460
I haven't played Risu.

126
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,960
I played a little bit of Sana.

127
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,940
Little tiny bit.

128
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,940
And by little, I mean like 2 minutes worth.

129
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,400
But I want to save most for stream, right?

130
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,660
Alright, let's try Risu.

131
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,180
Stage 1, Risu.

132
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,420
Big nuts.

133
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,560
After powerful singing that stuns targets for 3 seconds, Risu summons big nuts.

134
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,020
Cool.

135
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,600
Can you tell us how you escaped Wawa's...

136
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,480
Her vacuum?

137
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,420
That's like confidential.

138
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,740
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,940
Thanks!

140
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,680
Thanks!

141
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,380
You evolved from Chibi Minto to Minto Minto.

142
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,640
That's professionalism.

143
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,650
Farm 1 billion coins.

144
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,230
Yeah, I've heard that Risu is best for...

145
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,430
For coinage.

146
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,870
But I do not know why.

147
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:17,270
I do not know what makes her the coin master.

148
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,870
I'm so used to playing Fauna.

149
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,430
Not having to...

150
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:22,970
Aim.

151
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,910
So if I ever get to aim...

152
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,170
Sorry.

153
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,670
I don't want more nuts.

154
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,470
Non-stop nuts!

155
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,640
This is cute today too.

156
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,100
Thank you.

157
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,460
Big nut.

158
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,760
Greed stamp plus super chatto.

159
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,800
Ah...

160
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,980
You're a super...

161
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,100
You're a professional cute.

162
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,750
Non-stop nuts!

163
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,510
I appreciate you guys giving advice.

164
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,630
But try not to backseat too much.

165
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,670
Because you know I'm...

166
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,090
It's only my second time playing on stream.

167
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,750
And so I still am trying to like experiment.

168
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,270
And I still...

169
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:34,330
Oh!

170
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,690
I didn't even notice that guy.

171
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,050
I'm just trying to play and learn things myself.

172
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,850
But thank you.

173
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,730
Thanks for posting on Blue Sky.

174
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,590
I forgot my login.

175
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,430
For Blue Sky.

176
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,690
So...

177
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:55,890
Um...

178
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,070
I forgot my login for Blue Sky.

179
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,510
So I kept forgetting to login.

180
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,530
But if you use a Blue Sky, I'm on it.

181
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,450
And I will hope...

182
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,510
I will try to put...

183
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:07,670
Oh!

184
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,430
Wait.

185
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,010
Oh gosh.

186
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,510
It's like YouTube is integrated with the...

187
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:11,850
With...

188
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,810
With Twitter.

189
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,710
I wonder if the link...

190
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,730
I wonder if the link is integrated with Blue Sky.

191
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,350
So I can easily post there too.

192
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,590
When I start streaming.

193
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:25,940
Deez.

194
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,100
I've never seen...

195
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,340
I don't think I've ever seen DLC before.

196
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:30,740
Game one.

197
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,140
Holocoin every three seconds!

198
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,000
Is this the big money?

199
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,920
Deez.

200
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,560
Inflicts internal damage.

201
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,180
Reese's main weapon has a 10% chance to inflict damage equal to 20% chance...

202
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,840
Deez.

203
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,600
20% of a non-boss target's HP.

204
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,300
DLC is your skill.

205
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,340
Well, I mean, these are both skills.

206
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,520
We should go with the DLC first.

207
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,520
Because it's cumulative.

208
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,060
After gaining Holocoins five times.

209
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,520
Create another Reese's.

210
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,350
Don't touch me!

211
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,910
Burger.

212
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,050
Oh!

213
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:22,610
Oh!

214
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,090
Oh!

215
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,250
Oh!

216
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,690
Okay.

217
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,510
Two Reese's.

218
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,710
Okay, I should...

219
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,770
I'm going to add another nut.

220
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,290
More Reese's!

221
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:43,870
More Reese's!

222
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,670
Nut squared.

223
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,930
Unlimited nut works.

224
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,050
Gained two coins!

225
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,690
Yeah.

226
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,510
What was that noise?

227
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,450
Shadow Jutsu.

228
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,530
Kage no... Kage no Nut.

229
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,490
Oh, that ult's available.

230
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,010
Okay.

231
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,630
Shadow Nut Jutsu.

232
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,560
Yippee!

233
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,760
Dududu dududu dududu dudududu dududududu dudududu dududu...

234
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,580
One more nut!

235
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,160
I don't...

236
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,380
feel like...

237
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,440
The sake... Is the sake any good?

238
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,900
Is sake any good?

239
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,260
Is sake okay?

240
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,660
It's free.

241
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,020
Yeah, but...

242
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,080
Gain 1% crit buff every second up to 10%.

243
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,120
If taking damage by target, lose half the buff.

244
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,440
Depends on the build.

245
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,370
It's good if you don't get hit.

246
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,670
Risa doesn't really build crit.

247
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,650
Never turn down for Risaka.

248
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,230
You know what?

249
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,730
So true.

250
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:44,930
But I feel like if she doesn't have crit, then it's probably whatever, right?

251
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,050
It's my birthday.

252
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,270
JCTR, happy birthday!

253
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,730
Happy birthday to you.

254
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,590
Happy birthday to you.

255
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,450
Happy birthday JCTR.

256
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,020
Happy birthday to you.

257
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:08,870
Happy birthday to you.

258
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,210
Let's keep going with the DLC.

259
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,910
Let's keep going with the DLC.

260
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,350
Coin.

261
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,450
Coin, coin, coin.

262
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,070
Oh my gosh, wait.

263
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,890
It's kind of hard to tell which Risu is me.

264
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,910
That's a lot of nuts!

265
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,390
Nuts awakened!

266
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,070
Oh my god, they bounce!

267
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,930
Oh my gosh, I kind of miss that movie so much.

268
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,970
The Kung Pao movie.

269
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,450
I wonder if that movie's aged...

270
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,130
gracefully or not.

271
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,830
You know what I mean?

272
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,090
Like I wonder...

273
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,750
if it's...

274
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,110
still like... I say this every time.

275
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,050
I use this as an excuse.

276
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,070
I used to be a Lion King 1 1⁄2 believer.

277
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,850
I was like, that movie was sooo funny.

278
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,890
That movie was like... oh my gosh.

279
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,630
On par with Lion King 1 and 2.

280
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,150
And then I was like, I'm gonna watch it with a friend.

281
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,070
And I'll show the world how good Lion King 1 1⁄2 was.

282
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,730
And then I was watching and I was like...

283
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,050
And I was like, not very funny.

284
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,770
And I was like...

285
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,610
I was like...

286
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,170
The funny part will come.

287
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,070
Just keep watching.

288
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:39,790
Oh, this part.

289
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,830
This part's really funny.

290
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,550
And that part would happen and I'd be like...

291
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,950
And I was just like...

292
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,370
Don't worry, it'll get there.

293
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,010
It'll get there.

294
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,610
And it just...

295
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,530
But it never did.

296
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,950
It never did.

297
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,250
Nostalgia's a cruel mistress.

298
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,530
But...

299
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,150
I feel like for Kung...

300
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:08,630
Pao...

301
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,490
That movie...

302
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,730
I feel like it was still funny.

303
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,190
Even now.

304
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,390
Oh, what's up here?

305
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,310
What do we got?

306
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,110
What do we got?

307
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,670
An anvil!

308
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,590
What's in ha...

309
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,830
Oh, I don't have much, do I?

310
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,750
Oh.

311
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,940
Maybe I could've saved it for later.

312
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,400
Oh well.

313
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,700
Watch along.

314
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,840
Shall we have the...

315
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,780
The council decide?

316
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,600
Funny...

317
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,880
Funny haha or funny...

318
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,460
Oh...

319
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,360
Watch Kung Pao just the other day?

320
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:53,820
Still amazing?

321
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,400
No way.

322
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,020
Oh, I haven't even tried the special yet.

323
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,120
Idol costume's amazing?

324
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,920
I do...

325
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,640
I...

326
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,180
Have used it...

327
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,820
In other...

328
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,300
Things.

329
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Mint is a Disney sequel believer?

330
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,160
Depends.

331
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,140
Trying to think of like...

332
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,080
I mean, there's plenty...

333
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,300
Like...

334
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,260
Pocahontas 2?

335
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,740
I...

336
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,260
I love so much.

337
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,660
Because it's so bad.

338
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,520
It's so...

339
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,500
Bad.

340
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,180
Cinderella 3?

341
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,380
Cinderella 3?

342
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,060
When she goes back in time?

343
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,070
Okay.

344
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,170
I'm gonna go with idol costume.

345
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,430
Sorry.

346
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:50,710
Oh!

347
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,590
See?

348
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,190
My luck is not so great, everybody.

349
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,190
Cinderella has the three parts?

350
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,910
You would be surprised.

351
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,000
Gosh, there's just nuts everywhere.

352
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,020
Which one do we wanna go for?

353
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:14,700
Um...

354
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,500
I don't know.

355
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,120
It's so funny.

356
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,640
They could explode into nuts.

357
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,940
Let's just keep going with the nuts.

358
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,580
Piggy bank.

359
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:28,860
Oh!

360
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,180
I should've gone for piggy bank.

361
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,760
Oh, my bad.

362
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,260
Sorry, guys.

363
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:31,780
Okay.

364
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,460
When we get piggy bank back...

365
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:37,860
Greed!

366
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,520
Greed!

367
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,730
Let's just keep going.

368
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,630
Let's just keep enhancing.

369
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:52,670
For now.

370
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,410
Okay.

371
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:54,330
Okay.

372
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,130
Okay.

373
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,390
Oh!

374
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,810
Oh!

375
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:57,290
Ow!

376
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:02,770
Oh, my God.

377
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,330
There's so many nuts.

378
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,250
Non-stop nuts.

379
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,070
Non-stop nuts.

380
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:05,670
Non-stop nuts.

381
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:06,930
Ow!

382
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,300
Okay.

383
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,000
They're fast.

384
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,580
They are.

385
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,690
Projectile up stamp.

386
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,790
Adds one additional shot.

387
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,190
Oh.

388
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,430
Does not affect...

389
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,610
Okay.

390
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,490
I...

391
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,570
We have a lot of those.

392
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,230
We have non-stop nuts!

393
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:35,850
For real!

394
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,610
Oh!

395
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,250
Oh!

396
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,170
Oh!

397
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,030
Oh!

398
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,850
Non-stop nuts!

399
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:41,550
For real!

400
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,670
Holy moly!

401
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,510
That's a lot of nuts!

402
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,410
We'll just max that out while we're here.

403
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,700
I lost track of my...

404
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,760
Of my cursor.

405
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,200
But we're okay now.

406
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,080
Oh!

407
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,260
Oh!

408
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,660
I want to try...

409
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,160
Let's try the special.

410
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,080
Once we get kind of surrounded, I'll do the special.

411
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,640
I don't know what it does, but...

412
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,560
We shall see.

413
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,460
I don't know what it does because I didn't read!

414
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,060
Oh!

415
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:30,940
Nice.

416
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,590
Hmm...

417
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,830
I still also...

418
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,470
It's hard because I still also don't know, like, what combines with what entirely.

419
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,550
Like, I know the bucket we can combine with the spiders.

420
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,110
Right?

421
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,900
Non-stop nuts September!

422
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,220
Yeah!

423
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,620
Right click?

424
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,200
Axe and bucket combine?

425
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,020
Oh, they do?

426
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,700
What do you mean click right?

427
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,360
I am.

428
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,760
Bucket combines with the lie.

429
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,080
Ah!

430
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,440
Click on the blue panel.

431
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:16,880
Oh!

432
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,580
Oh!

433
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,560
This one!

434
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:18,800
Oh!

435
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,060
Ah!

436
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,620
Yeah!

437
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:21,940
Yeah!

438
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,240
Yeah!

439
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,920
I know this one.

440
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,580
Oh!

441
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,440
This is the BL with the...

442
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,720
We don't have the BL yet, but maybe we should get the axe and try and create this.

443
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,540
Okay.

444
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,680
I think I'll go with that.

445
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,340
I like the whammy water.

446
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,220
What does...

447
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,620
I remember you can do something with the whammy water at the dorm.

448
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm going psycho mode.

449
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,780
I'm going psycho mode.

450
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,600
Let's do the skills.

451
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,360
Let's level up the skills first.

452
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,130
Not jutsu.

453
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,900
I'm just going in circles here.

454
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,120
What was this?

455
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,580
What?

456
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:29,820
Ah!

457
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,280
I'm stuck.

458
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,620
Attacks have 20% chance to reduce attack and defensive targets.

459
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:37,880
Oh!

460
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,420
Flower.

461
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,080
Flower.

462
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,100
Ah!

463
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,540
Guys, we have nuts for days.

464
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,100
BL book.

465
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,320
BL book.

466
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,040
All right.

467
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,180
Now I just got to work on leveling those up.

468
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,680
And we'll be...

469
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,260
We'll be good.

470
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,360
Uh

471
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,900
-oh.

472
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,300
Guys, I think we're surrounded.

473
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,040
Oh!

474
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
Risu, is it cute?

475
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,440
Wait.

476
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,420
Stat up?

477
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,240
I've never seen this before, I think.

478
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,480
Where does it...

479
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,340
Where does it go?

480
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,440
Is it like with the skills?

481
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,580
Try your special now?

482
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,440
It's just a stat?

483
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,040
Oh.

484
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:52,980
Okay.

485
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,940
People are saying to check to do the gorillas' paws.

486
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,600
Is that good?

487
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,440
Because we don't have much critical...

488
00:25:59,440 --> 00:25:59,920
Everyone is so smart.

489
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,700
We don't have much crit chance, so...

490
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,860
Makes sense!

491
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,160
I'll try it!

492
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,840
And then...

493
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,460
What did that do?

494
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,100
Holy moly.

495
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,120
First...

496
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,060
The first target this weapon hits is marked.

497
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,760
The marked target will receive 20% of the damage.

498
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,860
What if I enhance greed instead?

499
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
More greed!

500
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,700
Okay, we were all on the same page!

501
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,620
I'm so happy.

502
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,700
I'm so happy you guys are also on the same page as me.

503
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,040
I'm so happy we're all on the same page.

504
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,960
We're money, money, money, baby.

505
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,280
More money, more babes, baby.

506
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,620
They say more money, more problems, but...

507
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,000
I have 99 Hololive members.

508
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:15,980
And...

509
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,960
They're...

510
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,580
Wait, hold on.

511
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,920
How does that go?

512
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,060
I have 99...

513
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,900
I have 99 problems.

514
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,880
Wait, no.

515
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,340
I have...

516
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:27,700
Wait.

517
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,280
I have the...

518
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,180
I have...

519
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,300
I have 99 girls and a problem is one of...

520
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:34,540
Wait.

521
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,340
Is how the...

522
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,120
Anyway...

523
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,960
You guys get what I mean.

524
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,160
You guys get it!

525
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,680
You guys get it!

526
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,480
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about!

527
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,140
Don't act like I'm crazy.

528
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,460
Don't act like you don't know.

529
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,220
Don't act like I'm not...

530
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,080
Making total sense here.

531
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,180
I am!

532
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,740
I am!

533
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,160
I am!

534
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,520
I am!

535
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:26,900
I am!

536
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,280
I'm making total sense.

537
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,900
But you are crazy.

538
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,680
But you are crazy.

539
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,420
But you are crazy.

540
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:36,940
But you are crazy.

541
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,100
Let's go for the Psycho.

542
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,220
Maybe I have more problems than I thought I did.

543
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,920
Maybe I have more problems than I...

544
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,520
than I realized.

545
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,440
I like the Nightly Milk too.

546
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,580
I like that one.

547
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,820
I think.

548
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,780
I'm gonna... but I wanna go... I wanna get my...

549
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:14,560
Yippee!

550
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,880
I got 99 problems, but a mint ate one.

551
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,660
What?

552
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,700
Oh, I'll take that.

553
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,740
Guys, I... that's like the first...

554
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,080
rainbow box I've gotten.

555
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,220
Oh my gosh.

556
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:34,860
Oh my gosh.

557
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,540
That's the first rainbow box I've gotten.

558
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,500
Like...

559
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,120
I haven't gotten one since playing the first time.

560
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,420
Let's see.

561
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,020
Let's go with the Gorillas, pal.

562
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,420
What can we... what can we level up?

563
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,280
Oh, let's do the book.

564
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,480
Upgrade.

565
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,660
Yeah, you guys bring all the luck.

566
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,540
My chat brings all the luck to the yard.

567
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,620
And they're like...

568
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,280
We're lucky, chat.

569
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,240
And they're like...

570
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,540
I'm a lucky, chat.

571
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,320
I can teach you.

572
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,800
But you'll have to super chat.

573
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:26,340
Oh!

574
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,300
Pekka pekka!

575
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,580
Swap flower.

576
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,380
Replace the third one.

577
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,040
Please teach me.

578
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,800
Today, the student surpasses the master.

579
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,540
Buff greed.

580
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,160
Hey.

581
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,860
Works for me, baby.

582
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,960
Max greed.

583
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,400
I'm greedy.

584
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm greedy.

585
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,540
I'm greedy.

586
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,080
I'm greedy.

587
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,480
I'm greedy.

588
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,640
I'm trying to...

589
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,920
get another amp.

590
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,440
Like one of the good anvils.

591
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,240
So we can...

592
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,660
So we can...

593
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,940
get the...

594
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,580
book and...

595
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,560
the BL book and the...

596
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,720
There we go.

597
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,180
And the axe.

598
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,380
Okay.

599
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,460
Yes.

600
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,000
Money, money, money, money, baby.

601
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,340
Money, money, money, money.

602
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,600
Money, money, money, money, baby.

603
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:02,860
Money, money, money, money, baby.

604
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,700
Money, money, money, money.

605
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,860
So many bouncing nights.

606
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,420
I know!

607
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,660
There's more money here than...

608
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,560
than like...

609
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,060
experience.

610
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:15,580
Oh!

611
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,460
We're halfway through!

612
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:18,940
Pshew!

613
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,780
Oh gosh!

614
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,320
Oh!

615
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,180
Oh my god.

616
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,780
That was so close.

617
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,000
Reisu!

618
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,170
Ouch.

619
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,750
Um...

620
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,720
How much health?

621
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:37,980
Oh!

622
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,400
I was gonna say how much health did I lose, but...

623
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,500
It's actually okay.

624
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,210
I'll take it.

625
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,770
Okay, they're close.

626
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,270
You did get hit.

627
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,170
No, but my HP is okay!

628
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,230
I'm a-okay.

629
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,430
Okay.

630
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,690
If I got hit in your dreams...

631
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,950
Do you guys like...

632
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,930
like collecting everything that you want first, and then maxing it out?

633
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,650
Or do you like maxing one thing at a time, you know?

634
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,230
I prefer to like...

635
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,350
make one thing stronger.

636
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,390
You know?

637
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,170
Oh!

638
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:38,190
Oh!

639
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,810
Which one do I do?

640
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,850
Max, then grab build.

641
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,730
Yeah, I feel like that too, right?

642
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,190
Depends on the run.

643
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,590
I guess that's fair.

644
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,210
That's fair.

645
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,090
There's no wrong way to play.

646
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:57,770
Unless...

647
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,570
you die.

648
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,190
Then...

649
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,690
you played wrong.

650
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,130
And you got played.

651
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,050
That's...

652
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,570
just the facts of it.

653
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,040
Super Chanto time!

654
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,120
Super Chanto time!

655
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,470
Let's do the book.

656
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,430
Thanks for the climb, Marfei.

657
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,110
Super Chanto time!

658
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,250
Oh wait.

659
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,970
Oh no, wait, that triggers you guys.

660
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:54,290
Ah!

661
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,730
Ah!

662
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,130
Ah!

663
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,170
Dun, dun, dun!

664
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:58,770
Ah!

665
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,210
Thank you guys for the Super Chants.

666
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,510
Thank you!

667
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,250
Oh my gosh.

668
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,550
Mike!

669
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,550
Thanks for the prank!

670
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,170
I heard it's Super Chanto time.

671
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,290
Let's go more with the gorilla's paw.

672
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,880
We're killing it.

673
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,640
We're killing it.

674
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,160
We're killing it.

675
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,400
Where's all my money?

676
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,820
Where's all my money?

677
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:26,840
Where's all my money?

678
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,500
Why are you guys not dropping coins as much anymore?

679
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,480
Kei!

680
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,180
Kei, get out of here!

681
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,380
No!

682
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,700
Don't watch!

683
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,460
I'm embarrassed.

684
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,140
Go away!

685
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,460
No!

686
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,000
Go away!

687
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,540
I'm gonna end this stream.

688
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,440
Go!

689
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:52,620
Go!

690
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,380
Go away!

691
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,940
Thanks for the donut rock.

692
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,280
Thank you.

693
00:35:59,740 --> 00:35:59,760
Oh.

694
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

695
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,060
I have to...

696
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,700
The donut!

697
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,400
The trumpet!

698
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,100
The trumpet!

699
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,060
Attack size.

700
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,640
What was this?

701
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,440
Add one additional...

702
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,560
I think I should have increased the projectile.

703
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,100
Right?

704
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,840
That way we have...

705
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,680
Chicken noodle!

706
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,920
Hello!

707
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,220
More nuts.

708
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,500
Right?

709
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,320
More nuts.

710
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,460
Strengthen the nut.

711
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,160
I really want the trumpet though.

712
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,040
Super chat time.

713
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,560
I want the trumpet!

714
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,300
Greed?

715
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,600
Wait, it says it's max though.

716
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,020
I can't.

717
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,320
Ignore trumpet.

718
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,640
Acquire currency.

719
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,080
I know that it's bait.

720
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,800
Funny over strong.

721
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,600
So true!

722
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,500
I can't strengthen...

723
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,180
Oh, it's already max?

724
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,080
Oh, shoot.

725
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,100
Okay.

726
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,680
Okay.

727
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,420
Okay.

728
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,120
Okay.

729
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,300
Ah!

730
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,360
Nice!

731
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,420
Sorry.

732
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,300
Nice!

733
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,220
Nice!

734
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:21,280
Nice.

735
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,020
No!

736
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,600
Let's see.

737
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,860
What do we want to do now?

738
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:29,480
Oh!

739
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,460
Hmmm.

740
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,400
We can do this one.

741
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,720
This one...

742
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,900
The asa-coco?

743
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,980
More projectiles?

744
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,220
Oh!

745
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,000
Because we have that!

746
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,680
So true...

747
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,460
I'll take milk!

748
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,520
Nut milk.

749
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,340
Oh god, it's so annoying!

750
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,660
Back up, buddy!

751
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,160
Back up!

752
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,810
Oh wait, but this is...

753
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,670
Wait, oh I can upgrade it!

754
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,990
Does it cost money?

755
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:50,990
Oh, cost...

756
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,790
Oh, excuse you!

757
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,410
Costing money?

758
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,490
What do you think I am?

759
00:39:58,890 --> 00:39:59,730
Made of nuts?

760
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:01,770
Get out of here!

761
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,410
Max out Super Chatto time?

762
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:14,850
Okay.

763
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,690
Don't worry.

764
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,050
We will.

765
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,290
We'll max it.

766
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:19,970
We'll max it.

767
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:20,670
We'll max it.

768
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,490
Let's just...

769
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,630
We'll get there.

770
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,410
They're ganging up on us!

771
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,630
The chump is in the deadbeats!

772
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,170
Stop it!

773
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,330
Are you guys enjoying...

774
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,750
The stream?

775
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,170
Oh my god...

776
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:46,670
Whoa!

777
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,250
Whoa!

778
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:47,850
Whoa!

779
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,710
Super Chatto time.

780
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,570
Says so stream?

781
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,230
Question mark...

782
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:53,850
What are you talking about?

783
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,170
It is!

784
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,150
It is!

785
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,290
Oh my god...

786
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,230
It is!

787
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,290
It is!

788
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:00,230
It is!

789
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:00,490
It is!

790
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:00,590
It is!

791
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:00,870
It is!

792
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,370
It is!

793
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:02,570
It is!

794
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,670
It is!

795
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,050
It is!

796
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:10,190
Oh.

797
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,650
Oh.

798
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,870
What did I run into?

799
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,330
No!

800
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,720
I blame the trumpet.

801
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,580
What did I run into?

802
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,040
Actually, I also blame K.

803
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,740
Get out of here!

804
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,960
I ran with the deadbeats.

805
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,380
It's in my ectoplasm, okay?

806
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,300
Gosh!

807
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,300
Oh, that's so annoying!

808
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,600
Ow!

809
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,940
My coins!

810
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,560
Wait, I get to keep the coins, alright?

811
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,700
Yeah!

812
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,440
Disable weapon slots and upgrades for Max Green.

813
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,460
Wait...

814
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,860
Weapon slots?

815
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,760
Huh?

816
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,720
Money gained up!

817
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,300
You're all coming for your nuts.

818
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,140
Growth?

819
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,040
Where's growth?

820
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,760
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do!

821
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:27,920
Where's growth?

822
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,620
Am I silly?

823
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,080
Oh, here!

824
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,220
Increase the damage of character main weapons.

825
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,600
Aha!

826
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,300
Enhance.

827
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:37,920
Oh!

828
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,120
That's a lot of money.

829
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,540
Fandoms.

830
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,920
Sorry, fan...

831
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,220
Wait, that's what I said.

832
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,000
Wait.

833
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,940
Fand...

834
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,820
Yeah, that's what I said.

835
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:04,730
I'm okay.

836
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,270
I'm good.

837
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:06,910
I'm fine.

838
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,630
Game bonuses based on accomplishments.

839
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:15,590
Oh, cute!

840
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:19,710
Weapon limit.

841
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:20,570
Is this what you guys...

842
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,090
Wait, limit the max number of weapons that may be gained in the game.

843
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,710
Wait, what am I... Why am I doing this?

844
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:33,110
Oh, is it so that I can get greed over and over and over?

845
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:36,270
Wait, it would be...

846
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:38,110
Race 2 is great.

847
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:45,110
Her attacks work exactly like nuclear fission if you turn up the spawn rate and max out her non-stop nuts skill.

848
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:47,210
Hmm...

849
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,590
It's for money build.

850
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,790
Oh, it makes it harder.

851
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,190
Ah, I think I'm okay then.

852
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,070
I'm okay.

853
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:55,950
I don't want to make it harder, you guys.

854
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,510
I just died.

855
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,090
I just died.

856
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,850
I don't think I should make it any harder for me.

857
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,050
But I want to do Risu again.

858
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,090
I want to try Risu again.

859
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:07,610
And also...

860
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:09,970
I think I...

861
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:19,310
Okay, I know I just died using her, but I want to try the next level so that we can try and unlock the Halloween castle because I really want to play that one.

862
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:21,350
Money.

863
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:22,890
Yeah, we'll get money.

864
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:23,450
Don't worry.

865
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:24,050
Yeah.

866
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:25,910
You get money.

867
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,390
You know how you get money, you guys?

868
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,750
By playing the game.

869
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,410
That's how you can also make the money.

870
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,770
Say choose honestly or easier to farm money.

871
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:49,490
What a concept.

872
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,170
I know, right?

873
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,230
Let's do...

874
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,090
I'm going to enhance a little bit.

875
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:55,490
Let's go see what's going on.

876
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:55,710
Let's do like...

877
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,950
Let's do like stuff like this.

878
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:05,130
Let's do some like general overall attack.

879
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:06,130
Let's do...

880
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:06,790
Wait, what was that?

881
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,710
Increase attack speed.

882
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:13,230
Where is...

883
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:13,970
Where is haste?

884
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:21,650
The drops?

885
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,650
I did upgrade it.

886
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:29,610
I'm so stupid.

887
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:32,610
You need got it back.

888
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,150
That was haste.

889
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:33,590
I know.

890
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,210
Um, let's see...

891
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,050
Only這個是.

892
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,750
Sorry for the this.

893
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,870
One HP every five seconds.

894
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,790
Just like some quality, you know, some stuff that old.

895
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,670
And of course, money.

896
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,050
So, really, here's one.

897
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:01,670
HP every five seconds.

898
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:01,970
Just like some quality.

899
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:04,290
5 months of Spooky!

900
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:05,790
Lucky, thank you!

901
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:07,950
Thank you, thank you!

902
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:09,430
What else?

903
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:10,010
Pick up range?

904
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,030
Here, we'll do this one.

905
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,740
I'm going to do another haste.

906
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,300
I know I'm going to worry about critical right now.

907
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,560
Like the critical hit right now, because...

908
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,780
With Risu, it's not as important.

909
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,880
I'm going to...

910
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,100
Okay, this should be fine for now.

911
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,700
Where are you?

912
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:54,980
There you are.

913
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:55,960
Nuts.

914
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,240
Glad you're having fun, boss.

915
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:02,920
Thanks, Koki!

916
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,600
I am.

917
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:06,700
Oh!

918
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,380
Yippee!

919
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,280
Oh, I forgot.

920
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:13,960
There we go.

921
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:14,840
I was like, hello?

922
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,740
I am having fun.

923
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,760
I always have fun with you guys.

924
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:32,990
Wait...

925
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,010
Okay,

926
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:42,920
there we go.

927
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:58,530
I'm trying to decide what I want to focus on.

928
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,210
I feel like maybe the skills...

929
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,030
What the heck was that?

930
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,690
It was raining in here.

931
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,150
Give me a second...

932
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:41,630
Let's see.

933
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:42,450
Nuts!

934
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:48,390
Hello?

935
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,170
What's this one?

936
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:49,350
Wait.

937
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,570
Create a regular fan-spot.

938
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,510
No!

939
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:54,390
You guys!

940
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,110
I got... Hold on!

941
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:56,710
Hold on!

942
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:57,290
Hold on!

943
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:57,950
Hold on!

944
00:48:58,090 --> 00:48:58,770
Hold on!

945
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,650
You guys are trying to kill me!

946
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,250
I get it that it's more money, but you guys are trying to kill me!

947
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:05,970
You guys!

948
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,710
You're trying to... Hold on.

949
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,590
Before we get this... Before we get this...

950
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:17,090
Let's... Let's... Let me increase my stuff first!

951
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:21,550
And then... And then we'll do this later!

952
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,690
It's the best option for money!

953
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:25,450
I know!

954
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,330
But it's...

955
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:31,210
Let me... Let me... Let me... Let me increase my skills first!

956
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,750
I don't want to just be overwhelmed!

957
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:34,670
Like I am right now!

958
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:38,190
Oh my god.

959
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,410
Let me... Let me...

960
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,210
Let me...

961
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:43,150
Let me...

962
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:43,470
Let me...

963
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:44,610
Let me...

964
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,930
It might not show up again.

965
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:54,090
You want to say that?

966
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:55,730
You want to say that again?

967
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:57,470
You want to say that again?

968
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:58,390
It's a sign!

969
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,120
I hope you never listen to chat and let them mold.

970
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,120
It's like my favorite thing.

971
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,020
To be honest.

972
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,620
I also really like the body pillow.

973
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,480
I feel like a body pillow would be great for...

974
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,620
For... For this level.

975
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,160
This level is hard with the holo doll!

976
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,640
Do it no balls?

977
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,320
Is that a threat?

978
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,720
You can't say that I'm a chicken!

979
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,800
It's my weakness.

980
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,060
It will make me do anything.

981
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,780
Where's the money?

982
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:47,660
Hey!

983
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,200
Oh gosh!

984
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:54,620
You guys!

985
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,500
Ouch!

986
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:55,860
Ouch!

987
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,080
Ouch!

988
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,160
Mindy McFly!

989
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,900
Okay, more nut.

990
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,380
Ouch!

991
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,100
Ouch!

992
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:10,280
Ouch!

993
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,180
We're getting...

994
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,180
We're getting cornered!

995
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,320
Oh gosh, we're getting cornered for real.

996
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,060
I think we're going to do more nuts.

997
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:20,880
More nuts.

998
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,320
Guys, this is already looking kind of bad.

999
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,580
Oh my god.

1000
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,080
This is already looking kind of bad.

1001
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,800
This is...

1002
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,060
You guys are going to make it so I can't beat this level.

1003
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,300
You guys are going to make it so I don't beat this level.

1004
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:38,200
Oh god!

1005
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,760
I need help so bad!

1006
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:46,750
Well it wasn't available before.

1007
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,030
My ult.

1008
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,350
I'll do it now though.

1009
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,920
There we go!

1010
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,200
Food!

1011
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:55,400
Food!

1012
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:55,720
Food!

1013
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:55,960
Food!

1014
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:56,180
Food!

1015
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,780
That wasn't enough.導 wil Let's see.

1016
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,640
Let's

1017
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,980
see.

1018
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,260
More nut.

1019
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,120
attaching to eyes What

1020
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,390
is my hitbox anyway?

1021
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:31,790
Oh my god.

1022
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:32,410
Oh my god.

1023
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:33,770
I thought that was it.

1024
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,350
What the?

1025
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:41,390
Why did it disappear?

1026
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:42,910
I didn't click anything!

1027
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:44,090
That was weird.

1028
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,710
Why does it keep disappearing?

1029
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,010
Why is it not clicking anything?

1030
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,230
But my cursor keeps changing.

1031
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:53,650
Why?

1032
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:54,830
Why is it changing?

1033
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:57,890
I'm so confused.

1034
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,090
Wait, why is it actually doing that?

1035
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,310
I'm not clicking!

1036
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,870
Oh my god, there's like an army.

1037
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,410
There's an army following me.

1038
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,890
I'm not clicking, but it was doing that.

1039
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:21,010
Weird, weird, weird, weird, weird.

1040
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:22,990
Oh my god!

1041
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:30,700
I wonder if I should do the bandage.

1042
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,700
Or else I'll die.

1043
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:46,870
Wait, there we go.

1044
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:47,970
Oh.

1045
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:57,770
I'm just gonna keep running backwards.

1046
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,630
Why is it changing again?

1047
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,070
What is happening?

1048
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,150
It wasn't doing that the last round.

1049
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:05,510
Is there something wrong with my mouse?

1050
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:05,990
What?

1051
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:06,590
What?

1052
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:07,550
What is happening?

1053
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:08,470
Hold on, hold on.

1054
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,980
I'm not concerned about the experience right now.

1055
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:31,960
I'm concerned about my mouse.

1056
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:34,640
Hmm.

1057
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:42,580
Hmm.

1058
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,380
I think I'm just gonna restart.

1059
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,140
That's so funny.

1060
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Okay, well soon, Pill.

1061
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,020
Someday when I grow up, I hope I can be a ghost just like you.

1062
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:01,560
You can.

1063
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,620
Just have a lot of regrets.

1064
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:05,980
Oh.

1065
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:06,820
We're already back.

1066
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:07,740
That was so fast.

1067
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:08,800
Okay.

1068
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:09,740
Alright.

1069
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:10,680
Mouse.

1070
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,440
Mouse.

1071
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:15,800
Mouse.

1072
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,380
Mouse.

1073
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,740
True mouse.

1074
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,380
Alrighty.

1075
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:20,720
Alrighty.

1076
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,120
Alrighty.

1077
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,080
Alrighty.

1078
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,160
Alrighty.

1079
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:25,940
Alrighty.

1080
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,220
Okay.

1081
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,740
Let's go with...

1082
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,700
Not that anime.

1083
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,100
Oh no.

1084
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,880
Someone who recognizes mouse.

1085
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,500
True mouse.

1086
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:41,960
Nut.

1087
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,500
Lulu, you would want that.

1088
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,120
You would want the nut.

1089
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:49,870
You would want the nut.

1090
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:52,490
Alright.

1091
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,930
So far, my mouse is okay.

1092
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:00,350
Theme song is stuck in my head for life.

1093
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,130
It's under 17, so...

1094
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,470
Of course I love it.

1095
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:10,150
Let's do...

1096
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,250
Okay.

1097
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:14,690
Do I want the nut or do I want the BL book?

1098
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:16,750
Oh...

1099
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:23,090
Should I level up nut or do I get another weapon?

1100
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:24,130
Nut.

1101
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:25,870
Always nut.

1102
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:32,970
Fanbeam does good...

1103
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:33,230
Oh!

1104
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,170
I know Fanbeam and Asakoko!

1105
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:36,710
Yes, I know, I know, I know.

1106
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,190
Keep on nuttin'.

1107
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,190
Well, not for now.

1108
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:45,390
That is good to just get some strength in.

1109
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:46,870
But I feel like I need to...

1110
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,350
In this level particularly, I need more like...

1111
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:50,230
And...

1112
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:53,110
It's hard.

1113
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:54,390
It's hard because...

1114
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,170
Yeah, the reduced time...

1115
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,550
Like, we're so slow right now.

1116
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:00,730
So it's like...

1117
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,210
Minto needs DPS.

1118
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:03,830
It's true, it's true, it's true!

1119
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:08,250
Oh, that's a special cooldown.

1120
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,100
I'm gonna keep nutting.

1121
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,920
It might be a mistake.

1122
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,720
I might be...

1123
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,920
Going nut crazy.

1124
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,940
I might be getting greedy.

1125
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:30,240
Oh!

1126
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,460
What's this?

1127
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:32,700
Oh.

1128
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:33,800
Wait, hold on.

1129
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,580
Let's come here.

1130
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,260
Come here, come here.

1131
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:36,860
Oh, where did you all go?

1132
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,820
Where did everybody go?

1133
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:38,600
They were all here.

1134
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,500
Nonstop nuts!

1135
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:42,720
Nonstop nuts!

1136
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,820
We're nutting too close to the...

1137
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,040
Ah!

1138
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,880
Too close to the sun.

1139
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:47,760
It's true.

1140
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,100
Okay, good.

1141
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,800
Okay, okay, okay.

1142
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,060
More nut!

1143
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,940
One more nut!

1144
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,600
Oh, that was close.

1145
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,760
I see the...

1146
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,120
Sorry,

1147
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:07,820
I got anxious.

1148
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,160
Super chat time!

1149
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,880
But nuts!

1150
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:23,860
But I want coins.

1151
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,400
I have like no coins right now.

1152
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,720
I only have 14 coins.

1153
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,340
It's very sad.

1154
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,200
Okay, we're gonna start focusing on...

1155
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:38,500
Oh, see?

1156
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,360
See the...

1157
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,820
The more nuts...

1158
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,720
Truly does help.

1159
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,860
I also need...

1160
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,380
Which one is it that creates the shadow nuts?

1161
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,360
Which one is that?

1162
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,500
Nonstop nut!

1163
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,840
Mint wants super chat time.

1164
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,100
No, no, no!

1165
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,020
Oh, DLC!

1166
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:01,280
DLC!

1167
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,040
Okay, okay, okay.

1168
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,120
Okay, when that one comes up, we'll get that one next.

1169
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:06,940
Thank you guys.

1170
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,600
I wanna start focusing more on attack on attack attack.

1171
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,780
Oh, my goodness.

1172
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:16,540
Oh, my goodness.

1173
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:19,840
I don't

1174
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:26,870
wanna get cornered.

1175
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,370
I don't wanna get cornered.

1176
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,470
I think I'm gonna get cornered!

1177
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:33,330
Oh, there's DLC.

1178
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:35,390
Yes.

1179
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:37,170
Super chat time.

1180
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,610
Put the non-stop nut!

1181
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:40,270
No!

1182
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,470
This is too hard!

1183
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,350
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

1184
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,690
Catch a nut by its toe.

1185
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:45,930
If he hollers, let him go.

1186
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,190
My mom said to pick the very best nut.

1187
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:50,590
And you are it!

1188
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:51,750
DLC!

1189
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:01,870
Nut...

1190
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:03,970
6.

1191
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,280
Oh!

1192
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:16,820
Oh!

1193
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,400
Flower!

1194
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:20,900
I'll take it.

1195
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:21,880
No!

1196
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:22,780
Wait!

1197
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,540
I'll take it!

1198
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,640
Oh my god!

1199
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,100
Shady!

1200
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,820
What time is it?

1201
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,580
It's nut time.

1202
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,860
It's bustin' time!

1203
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,540
Thank you for the welcome super!

1204
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:36,960
Thank you!

1205
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,100
Non-stop nut!

1206
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,900
Alright, alright.

1207
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,800
Now I feel a little more comfortable.

1208
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,540
We are... Oh gosh.

1209
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,320
I said that and then I started getting a little uncomfortable.

1210
01:00:58,860 --> 01:00:59,880
I took a bit.

1211
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:00,440
I took a bit.

1212
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:00,980
I took a hit.

1213
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:01,520
I took a hit.

1214
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:03,460
What was it?

1215
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,000
Asakoko and...

1216
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,180
What's the other one that goes well with it?

1217
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:08,780
With Asakoko?

1218
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:16,340
I think I'm gonna grab the idol costume.

1219
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:17,740
Fan beam!

1220
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:18,340
Okay.

1221
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:24,940
Fan beam.

1222
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:25,480
Fan beam.

1223
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:25,680
Thanks

1224
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,340
for the super joy!

1225
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:31,980
Hold on.

1226
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,320
One of the workers of Spirit Halloween.

1227
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,700
He's a huge fan of MGS.

1228
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,180
Can't wait for Delta!

1229
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:41,900
Yeah!

1230
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:43,400
Me too!

1231
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,040
Let's do more coins.

1232
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,020
Can't wait for MGS3 Delta.

1233
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,200
Delta and MGS collection volume 2.

1234
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:58,680
Me too!

1235
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,180
Upgrade knight?

1236
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:00,780
Wait, can I?

1237
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,940
But it costs money.

1238
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:07,360
But it costs money.

1239
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,160
It's fine.

1240
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,020
We have super chat time.

1241
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,300
Wow!

1242
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,380
Wow!

1243
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,600
Enhance a weapon once.

1244
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,280
I got an achievement.

1245
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:18,700
Yippee!

1246
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,540
I'm gonna do these.

1247
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,440
It's literally only 50 coins.

1248
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,300
In this economy?

1249
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,660
That's everything!

1250
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,280
Oh my gosh.

1251
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,000
We've just been kinda hanging out in the same little area the whole time.

1252
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,400
We're gaming.

1253
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,040
We're gaming.

1254
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,760
We're gaming.

1255
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:42,480
We're gaming.

1256
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:44,220
We're gaming.

1257
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:44,860
We're gaming.

1258
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,200
Let's keep getting these... the...

1259
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:53,840
Oi!

1260
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:54,360
Oi!

1261
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,380
We'll keep working on the skills.

1262
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:57,640
The skills.

1263
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,180
The skills.

1264
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,420
Getting our skills up and high and mighty.

1265
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:04,600
Oh!

1266
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,040
Azakoko!

1267
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:13,720
Wait.

1268
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,140
Okay.

1269
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,300
I do wanna get this actually.

1270
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,120
Shoop!

1271
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:18,600
Shoop!

1272
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:18,840
Shoop!

1273
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:19,720
Shoop!

1274
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,280
Shoop!

1275
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:20,500
Shoop!

1276
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:22,540
Shoop!

1277
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:23,020
Shoop!

1278
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:23,260
Shoop!

1279
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:24,620
Shoop!

1280
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:24,620
Shoop!

1281
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:24,980
Shoop!

1282
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:25,560
Oi!

1283
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:25,860
Oi!

1284
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:26,140
Oi!

1285
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:26,240
Oi!

1286
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:27,100
Ah!

1287
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:27,720
Oi!

1288
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:27,960
Oh!

1289
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:28,740
Sorry.

1290
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,360
I had to itch my nose really bad.

1291
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:31,300
Oh!

1292
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:33,160
I had to itch my nose!

1293
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:41,190
It cost me.

1294
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:42,690
It did cost me.

1295
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:43,190
Hold on.

1296
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,810
It cost me everything.

1297
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:48,830
These!

1298
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:58,410
What nose?

1299
01:03:58,650 --> 01:03:59,970
What nose?

1300
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:01,210
What nose?

1301
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:01,830
What nose?

1302
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,110
That's what you guys sound like.

1303
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:09,870
That's what you guys sound like when you don't know what you're talking about.

1304
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:11,350
What nose?

1305
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:13,610
What nose?

1306
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,500
Oh, my gosh.

1307
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,400
It's just giving me all the same stuff over and over again.

1308
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,220
What nose?

1309
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,180
What nose?

1310
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,020
Whoa!

1311
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,520
Everything exploded into nuts.

1312
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:32,800
Oh!

1313
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,020
I'll take that.

1314
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:40,560
Okay.

1315
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,280
So far, not so bad.

1316
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:43,860
Oh.

1317
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,200
Ah!

1318
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,340
Sshh.

1319
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,080
Once more, I pay my streamer tax.

1320
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:50,900
Thank you, medic.

1321
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:51,840
Thank you.

1322
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,980
Introduce Matara to the plugin type Asakoko.

1323
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,220
What do you mean by that?

1324
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:02,700
The paw?

1325
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,040
Paw for good?

1326
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:05,280
I think you're right.

1327
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:05,880
I think it's...

1328
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,460
Mike!

1329
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,300
Thank you.

1330
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:18,140
We demand you cease and desist your false marketing.

1331
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:21,800
You repeatedly claim that you are not cute and not small.

1332
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,200
Further, you claim to be mint, but you are in fact turquoise!

1333
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:24,900
No!

1334
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,500
Our office will be in contact soon!

1335
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:40,140
No!

1336
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:42,360
I'll take it.

1337
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,200
You know what?

1338
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,060
BL book?

1339
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:45,960
I'll take it.

1340
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,080
I'll take everything.

1341
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:48,360
I'll take it all.

1342
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,360
I'll take it all!

1343
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:49,920
I'll take it all!

1344
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,480
He so knows nothing.

1345
01:05:58,830 --> 01:05:59,550
Joke's on you.

1346
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:00,570
I knows...

1347
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:03,210
Close, close.

1348
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:05,610
I knows a whole lot, okay?

1349
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:12,530
What's your favorite character in...

1350
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:13,630
in...

1351
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:14,410
in Riko?

1352
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:18,470
I actually didn't have a chance to watch so much because...

1353
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:22,070
I was in Japan when, like, it all was going down.

1354
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:25,070
But I... everybody really likes...

1355
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:25,630
Oh gosh.

1356
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,950
Gigi's character.

1357
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,330
Did someone say turquoise?

1358
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:30,490
Where is...

1359
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:31,430
Shut up.

1360
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,310
Sending money for legal, but...

1361
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:34,170
GONathan?

1362
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:35,050
Jonathan?

1363
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,280
Yeah, yeah.

1364
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,640
If I want to...

1365
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,580
If I want to catch up...

1366
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,520
How... what would... what would you guys recommend?

1367
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,040
Like...

1368
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,180
Because there's a lot of POVs.

1369
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:54,960
And a lot of streams.

1370
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,880
Get some Minto words of encouragement for the Wisps going through... stuff.

1371
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:00,460
Oh no!

1372
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,880
From someone who knows... knows the str...

1373
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,200
Wait, I can't tell if you're serious or not.

1374
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,620
Fauna Mart was a good watch.

1375
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,400
Play all at once.

1376
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:15,720
Okay.

1377
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:16,920
I'll do that.

1378
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,540
Let's just keep doing Asakoko.

1379
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:22,880
For now.

1380
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:29,500
So far, we...

1381
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,300
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1382
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:31,300
Hello.

1383
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,800
So far, we're doing so much better this round.

1384
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:35,920
Probably because we didn't get the money.

1385
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,220
We're like the Halu.

1386
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,980
Narissa and Erb.

1387
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:48,900
Screw it.

1388
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:49,380
Sorry.

1389
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:57,480
I need the fan beam, right?

1390
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,480
That's what we're waiting on.

1391
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:00,340
Fan beam.

1392
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:10,080
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh...

1393
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,340
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh...

1394
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,560
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh...

1395
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:15,960
I'm getting cornered!

1396
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:16,620
I'm getting cornered!

1397
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:17,760
This is not good!

1398
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:18,600
This is not good!

1399
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:19,300
This is not good!

1400
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,420
This is not good, you guys.

1401
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,880
This is not good at all.

1402
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,520
This is actually quite bad.

1403
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:31,740
This is really bad!

1404
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,800
This is really bad!

1405
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:44,720
I need the food!

1406
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,480
I need food!

1407
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:58,990
I see food!

1408
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:02,960
Okay.

1409
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,640
I see food!

1410
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:08,060
Boiker!

1411
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:08,400
Boiker!

1412
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:08,900
Boiker!

1413
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:09,280
Boiker!

1414
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,000
Watching from the hospital.

1415
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,340
Daybreaker, I hope you're okay!

1416
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:25,800
Boiker successful.

1417
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:28,660
What?

1418
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,040
Okay, I'm going to actually do the body pillow.

1419
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,280
Yeah, let's do the body pillow.

1420
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:39,320
Since we're struggling a little bit.

1421
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,280
Let's do body pillow.

1422
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,820
Holy moly!

1423
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:47,820
Oh gosh!

1424
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,620
What's up here?

1425
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,340
Oh, anvil!

1426
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,980
Let's see.

1427
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:14,850
The nuts?

1428
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:15,830
Do more nuts?

1429
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:19,430
I say paw for damage.

1430
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:22,090
Yeah.

1431
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:23,530
I think so too.

1432
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:29,790
All I need to do is survive.

1433
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:31,170
All I need to do is live!

1434
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:33,130
Oh my gosh!

1435
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:33,870
Oh my gosh!

1436
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:35,610
All I need to do is live!

1437
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:37,910
I want to get to the next...

1438
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:39,090
To the next round!

1439
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:41,130
Well, this one's good actually.

1440
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:42,050
Knockback is good.

1441
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:43,630
Knockback is good.

1442
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:46,430
I want to get to the Halloween castle!

1443
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:53,240
Knockback is good.

1444
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,180
Let's do.

1445
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,020
Knockback is good.

1446
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:05,920
Knockback is good.

1447
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:07,040
I'm nervous.

1448
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,680
I'm nervous!

1449
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:13,080
Ay!

1450
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,660
Chill out, get out of here.

1451
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:15,260
I'm nervous.

1452
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:15,640
Oh my gosh.

1453
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,840
Oh gosh, I thought my ult was ready!

1454
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:20,120
No-

1455
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,360
I couldn't outrun them.

1456
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,620
I couldn't outrun them!

1457
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:37,300
I was walking backwards but I couldn't outrun them.

1458
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:38,300
No!

1459
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:49,380
No!

1460
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,200
Upgrade movement speed.

1461
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,160
I think that's what we need to do.

1462
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:06,360
I think that's what we need to do.

1463
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,640
We need to upgrade our movement speed.

1464
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,740
Just by a little bit.

1465
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,780
And I'm gonna do... haste.

1466
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,180
Oh, never mind.

1467
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,020
I can't afford haste.

1468
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:27,240
I'm gonna do... cooldown.

1469
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,360
What is fandom?

1470
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,980
I can't buy it, but what is it?

1471
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,280
Damn girl, you poor...

1472
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:50,660
Shut up!

1473
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:51,620
I just started playing!

1474
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,760
What's wrong with you?

1475
01:12:58,420 --> 01:12:59,820
Use your free skills when you start.

1476
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:03,060
Okay.

1477
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:03,960
Well, next time.

1478
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,500
Alright, we're gonna make it this time.

1479
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:06,840
Alright, we're gonna make it this time.

1480
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:07,740
I believe.

1481
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,300
What if I do endless mode?

1482
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,640
Well, I can't really even make it until the end.

1483
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:13,080
You know what?

1484
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,160
No, it's just stage mode.

1485
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,280
What am I thinking?

1486
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,400
What am I thinking?

1487
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:21,720
What am I thinking?

1488
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,500
I'm trying to unlock the castle.

1489
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,060
Oh, wait.

1490
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:24,400
There we go.

1491
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,780
I'm trying to unlock the castle.

1492
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,620
Endless stage mode.

1493
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,080
Not yet.

1494
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:31,960
I want the castle.

1495
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,140
I want the castle.

1496
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,440
I really want the castle!

1497
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,700
I'm not really trying to money farm.

1498
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,640
I just want the castle.

1499
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,760
I know Risu.

1500
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,260
Actually, probably Risu.

1501
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:46,200
Well, okay.

1502
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,780
I'm like doing half and half.

1503
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:48,360
Right?

1504
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,800
Cause like I want the money to...

1505
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,640
I want the money to...

1506
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,540
to...

1507
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,000
buy more stuff.

1508
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:59,200
But I also just want the castle.

1509
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,740
Believe in castle.

1510
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:03,300
Yeah.

1511
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,620
Oh, that didn't...

1512
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:06,640
Oi!

1513
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:07,420
Oi!

1514
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,420
One more nut!

1515
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:13,400
Yeah, we're multitasking.

1516
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:14,520
What the hell?

1517
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,540
Why am I getting cornered so easily?

1518
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,600
Chill out!

1519
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:22,080
Chill out!

1520
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:27,660
Um...

1521
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:29,580
Multinutting.

1522
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:31,520
The castle is the friends we made along the way.

1523
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,060
Nope, the castle is real in there.

1524
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,510
Trust your skills as a gamer.

1525
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:51,930
Trust your skills as a gamer.

1526
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:54,150
Yeah, that's why I'm gonna keep nutting.

1527
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:01,590
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!

1528
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:02,930
Body pillow!

1529
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:03,550
Body pillow!

1530
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:06,670
Oh!

1531
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:07,310
Oh!

1532
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:07,850
See?

1533
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:08,570
Body pillow.

1534
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:09,690
Doing his job.

1535
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:11,190
Oh!

1536
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:11,610
Ow!

1537
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:12,530
Oh!

1538
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:13,270
Oh!

1539
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:15,650
Oh my gosh.

1540
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:16,870
Please.

1541
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:17,990
No!

1542
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:19,670
Oh!

1543
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:21,170
Oh my gosh.

1544
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:21,850
No, stop!

1545
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,010
No, stop nut!

1546
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:24,570
Nut, please!

1547
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:25,050
Nut!

1548
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:25,730
Nut, please!

1549
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:30,010
Okay.

1550
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:31,470
We're doing it.

1551
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:31,970
We're doing it.

1552
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:32,470
We're doing it.

1553
01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:32,990
We're doing it.

1554
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:33,510
We're doing it.

1555
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:37,760
We're doing it.

1556
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,280
We're doing it.

1557
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,460
I think.

1558
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:46,950
I just came here.

1559
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:47,310
Hello!

1560
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:51,530
Welcome, welcome!

1561
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:53,410
Then a body pillow.

1562
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:55,310
Just a little bit.

1563
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:56,970
Just a...

1564
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,290
Oh my gosh.

1565
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:00,310
When it gets really tight and dicey.

1566
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:01,710
Yep!

1567
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:03,750
Hyah!

1568
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:04,770
Hyah!

1569
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:05,690
Hyah!

1570
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,600
I wish...

1571
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,120
Oh.

1572
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,500
Wish I were faster.

1573
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:14,840
Alright.

1574
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:15,540
Oh gosh.

1575
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:16,980
Oh my gosh.

1576
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,220
I'm not feeling as confident in this one as I felt.

1577
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,060
There we go.

1578
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:23,500
Oh!

1579
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,180
Oh!

1580
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,140
Hasakoko and fan beam.

1581
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,080
Uh oh.

1582
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:34,830
One more nut.

1583
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,080
Fan beam!

1584
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,060
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1585
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:53,260
Hyah!

1586
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:54,560
Hyah!

1587
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:55,620
Hyah!

1588
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:57,220
Oh!

1589
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:57,640
Nice!

1590
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:03,800
If you get the solo weapon stamp, you could try a nut only run.

1591
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:05,620
You could try a nut only run.

1592
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:06,260
I could do that.

1593
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,360
Only nut.

1594
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:15,760
I must defeat this level first.

1595
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:16,200
I must defeat this level first.

1596
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:20,270
Oh my gosh.

1597
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:21,070
Oh my gosh.

1598
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:21,450
Oh my gosh.

1599
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:21,510
Oh my gosh.

1600
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:22,370
Oh my gosh.

1601
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:23,990
Oh...

1602
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:24,550
Oh...

1603
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:26,730
Oh god!

1604
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,450
We're fine, everybody.

1605
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:37,330
One more nut!

1606
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:38,790
Oh

1607
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:42,800
my gosh.

1608
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:43,100
Please.

1609
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,580
Why am I so weak?

1610
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:48,100
What is that?

1611
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:49,480
Gosh!

1612
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,000
Oh...

1613
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,860
I'll still take it.

1614
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,480
Oh...

1615
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:01,980
Get out of here, Yago!

1616
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:02,840
Not right now!

1617
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,040
Not right now!

1618
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,880
Oh my gosh, not right now, please.

1619
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:07,700
Stop.

1620
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:08,020
Stop!

1621
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:09,520
Stop!

1622
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,580
Where's my... please.

1623
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,860
My ult, please.

1624
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:26,990
There we go.

1625
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:29,270
Oh my gosh.

1626
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:31,530
What is this one?

1627
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:33,330
Decrease the... oh...

1628
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:34,930
Oh no, wait.

1629
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:37,670
Maybe I should just sell this one.

1630
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,530
Maybe I should just...

1631
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:45,690
Or... because I don't want to, like, enhance this one.

1632
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:51,510
I think I should sell it.

1633
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:55,430
But, like, I don't want to enhance this one because I'm going to use this...

1634
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,190
this crit up one for later.

1635
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,480
Leave it on the ground to use as an upgrade?

1636
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:07,240
Just leave it?

1637
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:07,580
Okay.

1638
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,420
I'll just leave it on the ground.

1639
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,220
We're littering.

1640
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:12,920
We're littering!

1641
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,400
Oh my god.

1642
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,280
Maybe the fan beam was not such a good idea for right now.

1643
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,660
Oh my god.

1644
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,100
Please give me upgrades.

1645
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,640
Oh, you guys.

1646
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:26,200
Ouch,

1647
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:45,460
ouch.

1648
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,060
Ouch, ouch.

1649
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:47,360
It

1650
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:54,010
hurts!

1651
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:57,170
Um...

1652
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:12,720
Oh.

1653
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:13,760
Oh!

1654
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:24,560
Okay, okay.

1655
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,400
Nice.

1656
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,500
I'm, like, missing every... every shot.

1657
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:35,420
Truly, you miss every shot you take.

1658
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,380
No shadow clones yet.

1659
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:38,720
I know!

1660
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,520
I'm not getting DLC!

1661
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:48,020
Let's do Gorilla Pong.

1662
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,440
Gorilla Pong!

1663
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:51,880
Gorilla Pong!

1664
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:53,300
Do-ble-le-le-lep!

1665
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,120
Oh!

1666
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,280
Wow!

1667
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:57,720
Oh!

1668
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:58,560
Wow!

1669
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,920
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

1670
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:01,680
Wow.

1671
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:04,420
There we go.

1672
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:04,580
There we go.

1673
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:04,880
Take that.

1674
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:05,380
Take that.

1675
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:05,780
Take that.

1676
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,320
Take that.

1677
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:09,740
Take that.

1678
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,800
Take that.

1679
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:11,560
Take that.

1680
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,740
Take that.

1681
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:16,880
Take that.

1682
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,040
Take that.

1683
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,620
Which is like... soon.

1684
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:22,500
Probably.

1685
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:23,900
Right now we're okay.

1686
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:24,320
We're okay.

1687
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:34,430
Oh my god.

1688
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:39,250
When I hear my health go...

1689
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:43,620
No!

1690
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:50,850
Do you guys want me to die?

1691
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:52,770
This

1692
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:58,490
would be a suicide mission!

1693
01:21:58,710 --> 01:21:59,130
Real!

1694
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:00,450
Oh my god.

1695
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:11,480
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

1696
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,860
Non-stop nut.

1697
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:18,900
Scared.

1698
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:19,620
Shut up.

1699
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:20,680
I am scared.

1700
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:23,560
I am scared.

1701
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:24,420
Greed!

1702
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,660
Actually, hold on.

1703
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,520
Swap.

1704
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,680
And then you.

1705
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:32,960
Oh.

1706
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:33,580
You.

1707
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:34,700
You.

1708
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:36,440
Strengthen.

1709
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:38,960
Hahaha.

1710
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:44,370
Money, money, money.

1711
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:46,830
Money, money, money.

1712
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:48,970
Money, money, money.

1713
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:51,990
Money, money, money.

1714
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:55,110
Oh wait, we have two more things over here.

1715
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:57,010
I just noticed them.

1716
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:59,870
You guys have probably been like, screaming like, Oh my gosh!

1717
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:01,250
You have the thing- Oh!

1718
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:02,750
You have the things over here!

1719
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:04,490
I have that one.

1720
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:05,950
Oh my god, no way.

1721
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:06,490
It's a trumpet.

1722
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:08,930
Why is- What's all the- DLC!

1723
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,370
What's with all these useless drums?

1724
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:12,350
Hahaha.

1725
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:14,610
Hahaha.

1726
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:15,990
Apply.

1727
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:38,610
Oh!

1728
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:39,710
Oh my god.

1729
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:40,250
Oh my god.

1730
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:40,690
Oh my god.

1731
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:41,090
Oh my god.

1732
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:41,390
Oh my god.

1733
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:41,630
Oh my god.

1734
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:43,830
Wait, what's this one again?

1735
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:45,490
Yeah, increase attack slot?

1736
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:45,790
Sure.

1737
01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:46,610
Sure.

1738
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:48,370
Yeah.

1739
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:52,650
Oh wait!

1740
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:53,230
Um...

1741
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,420
I thought this was an up- Sorry, hold on.

1742
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,660
I thought it was an upgrade one.

1743
01:23:59,320 --> 01:23:59,760
Um...

1744
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:04,510
Big nut.

1745
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:06,590
It's good for nuts.

1746
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:07,370
Yeah.

1747
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,720
I'm wondering if I should do spider cooking as like a...

1748
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:16,280
As like a...

1749
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,880
Outer defense, you know?

1750
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:22,620
Boo.

1751
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,620
Spider cooking, then get the bucket.

1752
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,060
In this map, it probably is really good, right?

1753
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:35,540
Oh my gosh.

1754
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:35,860
Oh.

1755
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:36,440
Oh my god.

1756
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,020
Oh...

1757
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,120
Oh my gosh.

1758
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,340
Oh my gosh.

1759
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:44,340
Wait, so now I'm gonna upgrade you...

1760
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:46,820
Nuts.

1761
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:49,220
I'm gonna- I'm gonna- What?

1762
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:49,700
The nuts.

1763
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,400
Wait for Asakoko for the upgrade.

1764
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:00,490
Now I'm gonna waken the nuts.

1765
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:07,050
Holy cow.

1766
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:08,030
Holy cow.

1767
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:14,410
Just ask yourself, what would Risa do?

1768
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:15,150
The answer is always, oh my god.

1769
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:18,170
So true.

1770
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:20,250
So true!

1771
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:24,210
Oh my god.

1772
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:24,990
Oh my health.

1773
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:25,790
Oh my health.

1774
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:39,020
Alright.

1775
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:39,860
Okay.

1776
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,160
We're shooting.

1777
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,120
We're rooting and we're tooting.

1778
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:48,120
Ah, Sokoku!

1779
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,000
We got it back!

1780
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:53,460
Oh, that was close.

1781
01:25:57,510 --> 01:26:04,730
I think it might be time soon to use my special once it appears to me.

1782
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,560
Let's do the fan beat.

1783
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,840
Let's just max this one out.

1784
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:27,360
Woah, woah, woah.

1785
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,120
Wait, wait, wait.

1786
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:32,840
Oh, now it's double.

1787
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:33,960
Okay, let's go.

1788
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,360
Okay, okay, okay.

1789
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:40,580
DLC!

1790
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:41,480
Ouch, ouch.

1791
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:43,100
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1792
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,820
I don't know who I just ran into, but... Oh my god.

1793
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:46,200
Okay.

1794
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:51,740
We survived!

1795
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:57,860
Oh, ouch!

1796
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:02,260
I don't need to use my special yet.

1797
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,500
I think I'm okay.

1798
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:08,580
For now...

1799
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:18,020
What?

1800
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:32,290
Don't forget to aim.

1801
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:33,110
I'll be honest.

1802
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:34,850
I completely forgot.

1803
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:36,950
I completely forgot about aiming.

1804
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:39,530
Why aren't you aiming left?

1805
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:40,790
Because I completely forgot, okay?

1806
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:42,890
Because after...

1807
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,610
After the...

1808
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:46,090
What's it called?

1809
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:49,970
The fan beam started going both ways, I completely forgot about aiming.

1810
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:56,870
Let's see...

1811
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:58,630
Let's go with these.

1812
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,240
Oh my god.

1813
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,640
We did it.

1814
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,240
Oh!

1815
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:19,030
Oh!

1816
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:28,260
I don't think I want it.

1817
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:31,860
I don't think I...

1818
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:34,240
I don't think I want the bomb.

1819
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:45,380
I don't think I want the bomb.

1820
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:46,560
These guys look like little...

1821
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:46,760
These guys look like little...

1822
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,700
Avatar, The Last Airbender, little Aang's.

1823
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:50,920
Avatar, The Last Airbender, little Aang's.

1824
01:28:57,940 --> 01:28:58,480
These guys look like little...

1825
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:58,980
Where do I...

1826
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:03,000
I'm like, do I max out or do I aim for Asakoko so that we can...

1827
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:03,380
I'm like, do I max out or do I aim for Asakoko so that we can...

1828
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,240
Because we have the fan beam.

1829
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:05,840
Because we have the fan beam.

1830
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:14,500
The 35P?

1831
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,100
Yeah, yeah.

1832
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,140
Max Asakoko?

1833
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:17,920
I think so too.

1834
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:21,330
Max Asakoko?

1835
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:21,330
I think so too.

1836
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:23,110
I think so too!

1837
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,190
Oh my god, so much money.

1838
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:31,970
Oh my god, so

1839
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:35,640
much money.

1840
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:35,820
Oh my god, so much money.

1841
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:36,200
Oh, what's this?

1842
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,420
A cold stamp!

1843
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,360
Unhit if player does not...

1844
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,720
get attacked by the target for 4 seconds, the player may become frozen.

1845
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,280
And take 50% cold damage...

1846
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:47,540
Wait, what?

1847
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:02,260
The target gets frozen.

1848
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:08,820
Buff the trumpet.

1849
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:09,240
Buff the trumpet.

1850
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:12,780
So true.

1851
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:14,720
So true.

1852
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:15,220
Did I just realize?

1853
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,700
It's Miko.

1854
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:19,660
Isn't it?

1855
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:20,120
The 35?

1856
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:21,580
I'm so stupid.

1857
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:37,840
I'm so stupid.

1858
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:38,440
MikoP.

1859
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,080
Japanese.

1860
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,480
How are you real?

1861
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:46,140
What are you saying?

1862
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:50,560
You don't believe in ghosts?

1863
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:53,600
Um...

1864
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,980
Um...

1865
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:57,500
Um...

1866
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:57,840
Try it.

1867
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,520
Oh wait, it's already maxed.

1868
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:05,280
Elito Minto.

1869
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:11,980
Nihongo Jozunt.

1870
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:12,940
What?

1871
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:16,240
I got Nihongo Jozunt like 5 times while I was in Japan.

1872
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:17,760
I'm basically...

1873
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,660
native speaker.

1874
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:23,880
I'm basically native speaker.

1875
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,620
The dudes must go, everybody.

1876
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:27,600
The dudes must go.

1877
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:29,700
Let's just...

1878
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,140
I'm just gonna strengthen this one, I guess.

1879
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:33,800
Yeah, I'm basically N1.

1880
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:37,040
I can read every newspaper.

1881
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,080
Attack size!

1882
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,260
You guys, I can't always live for the meme.

1883
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:52,020
When...

1884
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:54,660
When...

1885
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,620
I want to haunted house.

1886
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:00,200
No way.

1887
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,100
You can read?

1888
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:04,300
I can sometimes even speak.

1889
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:05,240
Oh my gosh!

1890
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:06,100
Look at them get frozen!

1891
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:24,880
What

1892
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:35,670
is the blacksmith?

1893
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:36,430
We just unlocked this.

1894
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:38,090
Normal anvils can be used twice.

1895
01:32:39,230 --> 01:32:41,530
Only applies to anvils since taking this item.

1896
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:41,830
Oh!

1897
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:42,070
Oh!

1898
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,200
It's good?

1899
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,920
I'll try it since I have not ever had it before.

1900
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:58,460
I like to try new stuff.

1901
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,280
I'm adventurous, you guys.

1902
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:03,480
I like to try...

1903
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,820
Wow, there's so much money here.

1904
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:05,500
Holy cow!

1905
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,400
There's so much money!

1906
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:16,110
Look at all this cash, cash, cash, cash, cash...

1907
01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:19,590
Oh my god.

1908
01:33:19,730 --> 01:33:20,510
Wait, I forgot.

1909
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:21,090
Okay.

1910
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:22,730
Those pizzas are her bad...

1911
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:23,490
are the bad pizzas.

1912
01:33:23,690 --> 01:33:23,850
Okay.

1913
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:29,910
Bad pizza, bad pizza.

1914
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:31,870
Don't go towards the bad pizza.

1915
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:33,230
Bad

1916
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:38,080
pizza, bad...

1917
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:38,700
She's frozen!

1918
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,540
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1919
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,140
No!

1920
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:46,340
Holy cow.

1921
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,280
That could have been really bad.

1922
01:33:54,910 --> 01:33:55,450
Um...

1923
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:57,010
So cute.

1924
01:33:58,050 --> 01:33:58,590
Weee!

1925
01:33:58,590 --> 01:33:59,530
Yoi, yoi, yoi!

1926
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:01,570
That was unfair.

1927
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:05,890
Freeze!

1928
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:08,430
Freeze!

1929
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:12,670
Freeze!

1930
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:19,390
Am I still hitting her?

1931
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:19,690
I wonder.

1932
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:21,050
From this length.

1933
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:22,710
Can't tell.

1934
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:24,670
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

1935
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:27,630
Bad pizza.

1936
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:28,990
We did it!

1937
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:31,470
Okay, guys, we're halfway there.

1938
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:33,230
Oh!

1939
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:37,130
We're halfway there.

1940
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,820
Make me a pizza.

1941
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:46,700
More toppings!

1942
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,180
Keep going for the Asakoko.

1943
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,000
We must max out.

1944
01:34:57,820 --> 01:34:59,960
Oh my gosh!

1945
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:00,800
Oh!

1946
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:02,920
Ah!

1947
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,920
We managed to avoid drowning!

1948
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,080
Alright, give me my golden anvil, please.

1949
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:29,990
Dragonfire!

1950
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:34,290
Oh my god!

1951
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:35,830
Oh my god!

1952
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:36,890
Woah, woah, woah.

1953
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:38,310
Woah, woah, woah.

1954
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:43,570
Now you need to aim.

1955
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:44,090
Yes.

1956
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:50,530
Let's just go with the spider.

1957
01:35:50,890 --> 01:35:51,810
Oh my goodness.

1958
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:53,090
Oh my goodness.

1959
01:35:53,410 --> 01:35:55,330
Okay, it's really hard to see though.

1960
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:59,110
These new guys are like so small.

1961
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:02,330
And my new attack is so large.

1962
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:04,730
And takes up so much space.

1963
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:06,490
You know what I mean?

1964
01:36:06,490 --> 01:36:07,870
It's so hard to see.

1965
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:08,910
Holy cow.

1966
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:11,410
Okay.

1967
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:16,730
It reminds... Because the attack is so big, it reminds me to aim.

1968
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:18,750
But it's also...

1969
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:22,450
It's a lot going on.

1970
01:36:22,570 --> 01:36:23,330
There's a lot going on.

1971
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:24,570
Oh!

1972
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:25,810
I'll take that.

1973
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:33,310
Yeah, I keep forgetting to lower the opacity.

1974
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:36,050
Um...

1975
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,200
I like the frozen one a lot.

1976
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:48,680
Swap size?

1977
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:50,000
Swap size?

1978
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:50,520
My size up?

1979
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:51,540
I think so.

1980
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:54,140
Yeah, I think so.

1981
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:55,600
Swap, swap.

1982
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,200
Yeah, frozen has been saving me.

1983
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:04,780
I'm gonna keep it.

1984
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,920
Size doesn't matter, Minto!

1985
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:14,820
When I was recording with Matara earlier today, we recorded the last episode of the podcast.

1986
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:18,120
And um...

1987
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:21,940
She called me a size queen.

1988
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:34,370
Because...

1989
01:37:34,770 --> 01:37:35,130
Okay.

1990
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:38,150
I like...

1991
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:39,270
Well, you know what?

1992
01:37:39,290 --> 01:37:40,790
You're just gonna have to watch the podcast.

1993
01:37:42,970 --> 01:37:44,730
Yeah, you'll have to listen to the podcast.

1994
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:50,750
I can't decide which one I wanna do.

1995
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:51,930
Which one I wanna level up.

1996
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:55,970
It's level 2, but it only does one level, right?

1997
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:58,250
It's not gonna make this one max, right?

1998
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,810
It's not gonna

1999
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:08,060
make this one max, right?

2000
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:10,420
Tune in to find out more!

2001
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:11,380
Otsu summer!

2002
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,440
Otsu summer!

2003
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,820
Oh, so maybe we should just do that then, right?

2004
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:19,720
Oh, it is max!

2005
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:21,720
Oh my gosh!

2006
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:22,280
Oh my gosh!

2007
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:22,660
Oh my gosh!

2008
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:28,320
Get your head in the game!

2009
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:30,020
Get your head in the game!

2010
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:44,080
It's so good that we kept the frozen.

2011
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:48,720
It really has been saving my BEARD!

2012
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:52,360
What's that?

2013
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,100
Reverse stab?

2014
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,700
Is that... veils?

2015
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:03,320
Weapons will fire backwards.

2016
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,440
There is no other effect.

2017
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:11,900
I get it.

2018
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,360
She's Australian!

2019
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,020
That wasn't an Australian accent.

2020
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:19,720
Bobby.

2021
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:37,130
Gorilla paw.

2022
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:41,730
I've been waiting for that one to come back.

2023
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:46,490
Paw, paw, paw, paw, paw.

2024
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:47,210
Oh wait!

2025
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:50,930
Wait, the knockback is good too though.

2026
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:57,920
But maybe we should keep the cold stamp.

2027
01:39:58,820 --> 01:39:59,820
Anvil on the left?

2028
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:01,460
There it is.

2029
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:03,440
Oh I see it.

2030
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:05,980
Oh wow.

2031
01:40:05,980 --> 01:40:09,680
Hold on, we gotta get through here.

2032
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:25,860
Where's the anvil?

2033
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:27,400
Oh, it's still over.

2034
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:32,300
Nice, nice.

2035
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:44,510
Oh wait, maybe probably monkey's paw.

2036
01:40:45,710 --> 01:40:47,270
Just kidding, I can't do monkey's paw.

2037
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:48,310
Oh, it's already in.

2038
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:48,590
Okay.

2039
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:51,490
It won't let me do the monkey paw.

2040
01:40:51,490 --> 01:40:51,630
The paw.

2041
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:04,600
The paw is maxed?

2042
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,640
Oh, when did I max him?

2043
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:09,600
Upgrade?

2044
01:41:13,670 --> 01:41:14,070
Upgrade.

2045
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:17,670
Let's go baby!

2046
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:22,270
Oh, bam!

2047
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:26,700
I took a small damage.

2048
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:32,040
Oh my god!

2049
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:32,660
Oh my god!

2050
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:34,180
Get me out of here!

2051
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:36,320
What do we want to get next?

2052
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:39,160
Um...

2053
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:41,520
What do we want to get next?

2054
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,560
Maybe the bucket?

2055
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:45,680
Right?

2056
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:47,380
Because then we can do the bucket and...

2057
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:54,110
The axe?

2058
01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:58,750
I guess we could have done the axe.

2059
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:07,410
Strength?

2060
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:23,650
Oh...

2061
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:25,210
I'm gonna take...

2062
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:27,770
I'm gonna go with the body pill there, right?

2063
01:42:27,810 --> 01:42:27,830
Okay.

2064
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:30,770
Alright, so far so good!

2065
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:35,930
What's this one?

2066
01:42:36,770 --> 01:42:39,130
Weapon hits have 10% chance to stun enemies temporarily.

2067
01:42:39,470 --> 01:42:41,870
Also has a 20% chance to destroy enemy projectiles.

2068
01:42:42,030 --> 01:42:42,150
Whoa!

2069
01:42:42,770 --> 01:42:43,750
Everything is maxed though.

2070
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:46,290
Hmm...

2071
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:48,470
I should have gotten how to...

2072
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:48,830
Shut up!

2073
01:42:49,230 --> 01:42:49,770
Shut up!

2074
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:51,050
Shut up!

2075
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:51,950
Sell?

2076
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:53,650
Oh yeah, you can sell them.

2077
01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:53,930
I forgot.

2078
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:05,850
Alright...

2079
01:43:07,230 --> 01:43:08,190
We're getting surrounded.

2080
01:43:08,370 --> 01:43:08,870
We're getting surrounded.

2081
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:09,610
We're getting surrounded.

2082
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:10,330
We're getting surrounded.

2083
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:16,250
There's so much money.

2084
01:43:16,970 --> 01:43:18,810
There's so much money to be made.

2085
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:20,830
So much money being made!

2086
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:32,310
So much money.

2087
01:43:41,150 --> 01:43:42,810
I'm not as strong as I think I am.

2088
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:46,690
I'm not strong enough to just stand here and take it.

2089
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:02,490
Come on, come on.

2090
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:05,630
Let's get some of these.

2091
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:06,250
Oh gosh.

2092
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:10,730
Oh god.

2093
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:14,610
You guys, we're in trouble.

2094
01:44:14,890 --> 01:44:15,730
We're in trouble for real.

2095
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:22,750
I'm getting cornered.

2096
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:37,720
I'm scared.

2097
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:39,640
I'm scared.

2098
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:50,960
We made it out.

2099
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:51,840
We made it out somehow.

2100
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:53,540
What the?

2101
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:54,320
Where did they go?

2102
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:04,980
Oh my god, this guy is fast.

2103
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,140
Oh my god.

2104
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:11,860
We're alive!

2105
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:28,040
I should get the... I should drop it and wait for the axe, shouldn't I?

2106
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,080
With the BL.

2107
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:32,860
I should get the BL and then the axe.

2108
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:34,500
Yeah, we're going to drop it.

2109
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:51,070
BL enthusiast.

2110
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:01,510
What item did I grab to get the... Oh my gosh.

2111
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:02,090
The BL.

2112
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:02,490
Oh.

2113
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:04,050
The BL HP.

2114
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:10,070
This is a stage.

2115
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:10,730
It's not endless.

2116
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:12,710
Oh my gosh.

2117
01:46:14,130 --> 01:46:14,690
Wow!

2118
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:17,550
The body pillow.

2119
01:46:18,030 --> 01:46:18,930
I see, I see, I see.

2120
01:46:26,230 --> 01:46:26,790
Nice.

2121
01:46:27,670 --> 01:46:29,130
I love body pillow.

2122
01:46:30,330 --> 01:46:30,890
I love body pillow.

2123
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:31,950
I'm going to run.

2124
01:46:32,070 --> 01:46:32,570
Oh my gosh.

2125
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:33,390
Oh my gosh.

2126
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:34,970
I was taking damage and I didn't even realize.

2127
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:38,690
Where is there any health?

2128
01:46:39,610 --> 01:46:39,930
Help?

2129
01:46:41,470 --> 01:46:42,010
I'm scared.

2130
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:44,850
Anvil.

2131
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:47,630
If I can get to it.

2132
01:46:54,650 --> 01:46:55,790
Oh, I forgot I can use them twice.

2133
01:46:57,850 --> 01:46:59,030
Wait, it's already maxed, right?

2134
01:46:59,090 --> 01:46:59,330
Oh yeah.

2135
01:46:59,410 --> 01:46:59,650
Okay.

2136
01:46:59,650 --> 01:46:59,730
Okay.

2137
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:07,040
Maybe I should...

2138
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:16,360
Wait, wait, wait!

2139
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:17,500
Sorry, sorry.

2140
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:18,060
Scared.

2141
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:25,220
No way.

2142
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:26,860
Guys, this isn't good.

2143
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:29,920
This isn't good.

2144
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:31,840
Enchant the bucket.

2145
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:34,420
This isn't good.

2146
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:37,040
This isn't good.

2147
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:38,840
This isn't good.

2148
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:42,980
This isn't good.

2149
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:44,980
Body pillow it is.

2150
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,260
I think we should do the body pillow.

2151
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:53,220
And then run!

2152
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:58,100
Oh shoot.

2153
01:47:58,620 --> 01:47:59,260
Oh.

2154
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:00,860
Oh, it's...

2155
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:01,860
Oh.

2156
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:03,160
Oh.

2157
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,460
It might be mint over.

2158
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:09,540
It might be mint over.

2159
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:10,620
Everybody.

2160
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:12,280
GG's.

2161
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:13,540
GG.

2162
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:15,560
GG world.

2163
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:16,860
Goodbye cruel world!

2164
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,240
Goodbye cruel world!

2165
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:19,620
Oh my god.

2166
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:20,040
I'm stuck.

2167
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:21,120
I'm stuck in the corner.

2168
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:21,580
I'm stuck!

2169
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:32,700
I'm never going to get past this stage!

2170
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:39,420
Yeah, I had no ult.

2171
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:40,640
I had nothing.

2172
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:45,600
I had no ult.

2173
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:46,880
Dang.

2174
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:49,920
I had no ult.

2175
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:56,970
Upgrade!

2176
01:48:57,070 --> 01:48:57,270
Yep.

2177
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:58,250
That's what we're going to do.

2178
01:48:59,090 --> 01:49:00,310
Because we got money, baby.

2179
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:02,030
We got money, baby.

2180
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:06,590
Let's do like the self-healing, right?

2181
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:10,410
I wanna do more...

2182
01:49:13,790 --> 01:49:14,570
and attack.

2183
01:49:16,370 --> 01:49:16,890
Oh!

2184
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,250
And the fandoms, that's right.

2185
01:49:18,410 --> 01:49:20,270
Wait, upgrade is what's under...

2186
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:20,570
Oh, here.

2187
01:49:21,630 --> 01:49:22,330
There we go.

2188
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:30,750
I just got called with great news after 8 years of teaching.

2189
01:49:30,990 --> 01:49:32,130
I finally got tenure!

2190
01:49:33,490 --> 01:49:35,590
No, I won't get fired unless I screw up royally!

2191
01:49:35,710 --> 01:49:35,910
Yippee!

2192
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:36,550
I'm so happy!

2193
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:38,150
Round for round!

2194
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:38,510
Congratulations!

2195
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:45,390
Oh my gosh, I'm so happy for you!

2196
01:49:51,870 --> 01:49:54,130
Piminto, it's my friend's birthday and he's a big fan of you.

2197
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:55,450
Can you sing happy birthday to him?

2198
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:56,090
His name is...

2199
01:49:56,710 --> 01:49:57,130
Mike...

2200
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:01,400
Hoach.

2201
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:03,300
Mike...

2202
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:04,580
Hoach?

2203
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:08,900
Love you always.

2204
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:22,760
Mike H.

2205
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:32,580
You're pronouncing it correctly.

2206
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:33,900
Carry on, Minto.

2207
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:37,640
You guys, I think...

2208
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:39,980
Mike... you can't...

2209
01:50:39,980 --> 01:50:42,300
Like, Mike is just a ruined name now.

2210
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:43,920
It's like you see a Mike and it's...

2211
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:46,120
You're so easily... you already...

2212
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:48,840
My sensors are already going off, you know?

2213
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:52,180
Supposed to be Hooch.

2214
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:54,800
Mike Hooch?

2215
01:51:29,070 --> 01:51:31,210
To be honest, I thought it was a...

2216
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:35,750
I thought it was like H-O-C-H and like the C-H was a K sound.

2217
01:51:36,110 --> 01:51:37,550
I thought it was like a Hawk.

2218
01:51:38,190 --> 01:51:38,830
You know?

2219
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:41,410
So Mike...

2220
01:51:42,510 --> 01:51:46,070
Hold on, I have to do a dramatic pause to let enough time in between it.

2221
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:47,250
Mike...

2222
01:51:52,490 --> 01:51:52,930
Hawk...

2223
01:51:56,730 --> 01:51:57,670
Two in one.

2224
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:05,320
Increase the damage of skills!

2225
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:06,820
Let's do that one too.

2226
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:21,580
I think... let's try it here now.

2227
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:23,280
We got way further.

2228
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,080
After doing some more upgrades.

2229
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:27,480
Alright, Risu.

2230
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:30,920
I got you to laugh so mission accomplished.

2231
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:35,620
Are you...

2232
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:36,000
Usa...

2233
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:36,860
Usa...

2234
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:37,740
Usa...

2235
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:38,280
Usa...

2236
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:43,800
Are you utilizing the food bug?

2237
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:46,160
Try a Mumei!

2238
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,540
I don't think I've tried Mumei actually.

2239
01:52:50,980 --> 01:52:51,660
Mike...

2240
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,180
Hooch...

2241
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:54,260
Mike...

2242
01:52:54,260 --> 01:52:55,280
Hawk...

2243
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:58,420
Really want me to become a pianist.

2244
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:00,240
Struggle is real.

2245
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:02,160
Mumei OP?

2246
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,340
Da da da da!

2247
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,140
Wait, hold on.

2248
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:12,420
Someone mentioned something and I don't know if I upgraded it.

2249
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:13,700
The pickup range.

2250
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:14,300
Oh, there we go.

2251
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:14,900
Okay.

2252
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:16,940
Topic...

2253
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:18,120
Can you say...

2254
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:21,280
Happy birthday to my friend...

2255
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:23,680
Mia Sho?

2256
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:27,140
Is that a real name?

2257
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:40,600
Mumes is really good once you awaken her weapon.

2258
01:53:40,700 --> 01:53:40,880
Okay.

2259
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:50,740
It's pronounced Maya.

2260
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:52,860
Maya Sho?

2261
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:56,700
Ha...

2262
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:58,540
That doesn't sound bad.

2263
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:00,440
Maia?

2264
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:02,420
Sho?

2265
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,720
Doesn't sound bad.

2266
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:08,140
Happy birthday to you.

2267
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:11,660
Happy birthday to you.

2268
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:14,420
Happy birthday...

2269
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:15,800
Maia Sho.

2270
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:20,300
Why are you guys saying no, though?

2271
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:21,160
It doesn't sound like anything.

2272
01:54:22,060 --> 01:54:24,220
Happy birthday to...

2273
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:33,360
I'm so... I'm scared... I'm scared.

2274
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,020
Sounds like butt.

2275
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:39,100
It does not at all!

2276
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:42,500
It does not at all!

2277
01:54:56,110 --> 01:54:58,330
We need some more haste, my goodness.

2278
01:54:58,650 --> 01:54:59,410
Oh my gosh.

2279
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:01,390
Bird feather!

2280
01:55:02,210 --> 01:55:04,630
Thank you for making a good night even better, Minto.

2281
01:55:04,890 --> 01:55:06,310
Glad you're having a good night.

2282
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:10,710
Chris is attacked with 1% for every target currently on the screen.

2283
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:11,930
Up to 100%.

2284
01:55:12,370 --> 01:55:15,490
In addition, getting a further 1% for every 100 targets ever defeated.

2285
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:19,070
Stop saying 1!

2286
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:25,570
You guys are like, hey Minto, we know that you have no upper hand.

2287
01:55:25,590 --> 01:55:27,570
Upgrades or anything, but what if you just like...

2288
01:55:28,590 --> 01:55:30,190
Made everything harder for you.

2289
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:30,370
Oh!

2290
01:55:30,510 --> 01:55:31,270
For yourself.

2291
01:55:36,810 --> 01:55:38,810
I'm not good with the aiming ones, you guys.

2292
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:39,670
If you haven't noticed.

2293
01:55:40,510 --> 01:55:44,230
I know there's already people in the chat that are like, um...

2294
01:55:44,690 --> 01:55:45,910
She just didn't aim.

2295
01:55:46,630 --> 01:55:47,430
That's why...

2296
01:55:48,110 --> 01:55:50,810
That's why she lost last time.

2297
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:53,990
But you know, sometimes you forget to aim when you're...

2298
01:55:53,990 --> 01:55:55,830
When you're upgrading.

2299
01:55:56,810 --> 01:55:58,090
And then you go out of the menu.

2300
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:00,070
You're not sure where the enemies are.

2301
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:01,190
Oh my gosh.

2302
01:56:01,390 --> 01:56:01,790
Hello?

2303
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:02,510
Why are...

2304
01:56:02,510 --> 01:56:02,810
What?

2305
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:03,790
Where are you guys coming from?

2306
01:56:07,190 --> 01:56:07,630
Oh.

2307
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:10,390
Take it.

2308
01:56:13,410 --> 01:56:15,250
You don't have to aim as much at level 7?

2309
01:56:15,450 --> 01:56:16,030
Okay, cool.

2310
01:56:17,010 --> 01:56:20,230
Congratulate their birthday with a fine bottle of Australia's premium...

2311
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:24,370
Daikin's Cider.

2312
01:56:25,190 --> 01:56:26,810
And a fine wood liquor box.

2313
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:31,440
Four?

2314
01:56:38,910 --> 01:56:40,380
I shouldn't go for the feather though.

2315
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:48,380
Four is good.

2316
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:49,080
The sunny glasses.

2317
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:51,080
Increase XP gain by 10%.

2318
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:52,040
And every level up.

2319
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:53,460
Oh, the weapon damage!

2320
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:54,040
Wow!

2321
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:00,720
Oh my gosh.

2322
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:04,100
Please explode!

2323
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:08,770
Please explode!

2324
01:57:11,110 --> 01:57:12,050
Not you!

2325
01:57:14,850 --> 01:57:15,510
Um...

2326
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:18,710
Sheesh.

2327
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:20,690
Oh my gosh.

2328
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:21,210
Wait.

2329
01:57:22,030 --> 01:57:23,230
Oh, oh, I'm trapped!

2330
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:23,690
I'm trapped!

2331
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:24,070
I'm trapped!

2332
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:25,830
Guys.

2333
01:57:26,830 --> 01:57:28,370
I'm struggling a little bit here.

2334
01:57:28,470 --> 01:57:28,650
Okay.

2335
01:57:29,230 --> 01:57:30,630
Stop distracting me!

2336
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:32,970
Food.

2337
01:57:35,710 --> 01:57:37,030
Oh, my ult is available.

2338
01:57:37,330 --> 01:57:37,810
Thank you.

2339
01:57:38,230 --> 01:57:38,770
Ah!

2340
01:57:39,230 --> 01:57:39,770
Oh!

2341
01:57:40,270 --> 01:57:40,810
Oh!

2342
01:57:40,810 --> 01:57:41,030
Ah!

2343
01:57:59,690 --> 01:58:01,290
Her ult is insane.

2344
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:07,060
It was so good.

2345
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:08,300
Um...

2346
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:10,260
Trying to decide which one I want.

2347
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,500
If I want to go for Civilization.

2348
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:13,420
Actually, I'm just going to keep going with the Birds of Feather.

2349
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:14,820
Birds of Feather.

2350
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:17,320
Oh, yeah.

2351
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:18,160
Oh, yeah.

2352
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:21,200
Now we're playing with portals, baby.

2353
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:22,840
Ja, ja, ja.

2354
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:24,480
Ja, ja.

2355
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:25,480
Ja, ja.

2356
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:27,620
Ja, ja.

2357
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:28,460
Ja, ja.

2358
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:29,600
Ja, ja.

2359
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:32,600
Ja, ja.

2360
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:32,660
Ja, ja.

2361
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:33,020
Ja, ja.

2362
01:58:33,020 --> 01:58:33,100
Ja, ja.

2363
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:33,420
Da, da, da.

2364
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:33,560
Ja, ja.

2365
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:36,720
Now we're moving.

2366
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:37,920
Ja, ja, ja.

2367
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:40,640
A friend.

2368
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:41,220
Oh.

2369
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:45,480
These ones I'm all going to get though.

2370
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:47,040
Like the skills, they're all...

2371
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:47,760
Eventually...

2372
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:49,320
So I'm just going to keep going with the Bird of Feather.

2373
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:02,120
I want the cold turkey again.

2374
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:04,960
I want the turkey again.

2375
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:07,640
I want the turkey again.

2376
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:08,700
Wait.

2377
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:09,580
I need to get through here.

2378
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:10,420
Excuse me.

2379
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:10,980
I need to get through.

2380
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:11,700
Here we go.

2381
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:12,160
I got it.

2382
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:14,580
Wait, I didn't see actually...

2383
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:14,780
Whoa!

2384
01:59:15,860 --> 01:59:16,380
Whoa...

2385
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:18,980
Bloodthirsty?

2386
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:22,700
Looks like a shadow resaw?

2387
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:23,140
Awesome.

2388
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:24,920
Let's go with...

2389
01:59:26,940 --> 01:59:28,660
Gain 1 stack of Bloodthirst.

2390
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:32,940
At 20 stacks, Mumei heals 10% HP and gains 3...

2391
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:33,260
Wow!

2392
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:38,060
Da-da-da-da-da-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum...

2393
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:39,480
Da-da-da...

2394
01:59:42,990 --> 01:59:46,070
What can the glow stick be combined with?

2395
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:47,430
I don't think I've...

2396
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:49,750
I've used the glow stick before.

2397
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:51,230
But...

2398
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:57,400
With Fanbeam...

2399
01:59:58,020 --> 01:59:58,840
Might as well?

2400
01:59:58,940 --> 01:59:59,700
Yeah, you're right.

2401
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:01,280
It's free!

2402
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:02,640
It's free real estate.

2403
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:06,580
Da-da.

2404
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:08,140
Holy moly!

2405
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:09,720
Holy moly!

2406
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:13,520
Sake or Fanbeam?

2407
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:14,740
Or Idol song?

2408
02:00:15,020 --> 02:00:16,240
I don't think I have Idol song.

2409
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:16,540
Let's...

2410
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:17,160
Can I get water too?

2411
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:19,020
Glow stick plus beam is good?

2412
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:19,440
Okay.

2413
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:20,940
We'll aim for the beam then.

2414
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:24,580
I still have to aim because I have the stick.

2415
02:00:25,780 --> 02:00:26,140
But...

2416
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:33,500
Yeah, you still have to aim a little bit.

2417
02:00:33,620 --> 02:00:34,240
Because it's like...

2418
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:34,760
Depending on...

2419
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:36,620
The direction you're going in.

2420
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:36,880
You know?

2421
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:39,260
Still gotta like...

2422
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:40,920
Take out the guys.

2423
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:42,220
It goes all over.

2424
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:43,680
But not all over.

2425
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:44,400
You know what I mean?

2426
02:00:45,860 --> 02:00:46,880
But it's still very good.

2427
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:49,980
Oh, Civilization.

2428
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:53,420
Four?

2429
02:00:53,700 --> 02:00:54,340
Why are we saying four?

2430
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:00,740
Friend makes it less aim.

2431
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:01,420
I see.

2432
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:04,560
We'll wait for friend to come back then.

2433
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:14,000
Oh my gosh.

2434
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:15,040
Oh my gosh.

2435
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:17,660
I could ult.

2436
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:19,480
But I won't do it.

2437
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:20,120
Friend!

2438
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:21,040
Friend!

2439
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:23,860
There he is!

2440
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:28,960
Holy cow.

2441
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:36,600
Ult time.

2442
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:37,400
No no.

2443
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:39,440
No no, not yet.

2444
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:41,720
He looks like you?

2445
02:01:43,180 --> 02:01:44,260
Kinda does.

2446
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:48,040
Kinda does.

2447
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:52,940
Is he collecting experience farming even?

2448
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:53,940
Oh my gosh.

2449
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:54,620
Oh my gosh.

2450
02:01:54,620 --> 02:01:55,700
I forgot to aim.

2451
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:56,500
I forgot to aim.

2452
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:57,020
Oh my gosh.

2453
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:58,120
Oh, ouch!

2454
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:01,780
He is?

2455
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:03,460
Oh my gosh, he's such a good little guy!

2456
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:10,860
Do I want to do body pillow again?

2457
02:02:11,980 --> 02:02:12,960
Can I collect?

2458
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:13,900
I'm a good guy.

2459
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:17,860
Do I want to do body pillow or get the glasses up?

2460
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:22,460
All good options, I know!

2461
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:25,960
Sorry, I'm stretching.

2462
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:28,880
Okay...

2463
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:34,840
I have been not sleeping so well recently, so...

2464
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:38,500
The stretches are good.

2465
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:40,960
Good stretch.

2466
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:45,120
Glasses to get it off the board?

2467
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:48,480
I guess we are almost max... wait...

2468
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:50,720
Glasses... or sk... hold on.

2469
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:53,680
Items max at 5, right?

2470
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:55,200
So that one is technically max now?

2471
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:58,040
I believe, right?

2472
02:03:04,030 --> 02:03:04,990
Yes, okay, okay.

2473
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:06,950
Good, good, good!

2474
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:19,020
Gonna go with the glow stick.

2475
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:23,980
I do... if we get idol costume again, I'll get it later.

2476
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:30,960
Right now, I kinda... I do want it.

2477
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:34,320
I kinda wanna...

2478
02:03:34,860 --> 02:03:37,160
I wanna get also some defense items.

2479
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:38,900
I just wanted to get like a good...

2480
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:40,140
What's the word?

2481
02:03:41,740 --> 02:03:44,300
You know, like I wanna get my build to like...

2482
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:49,600
A decent attack and everything and then...

2483
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:50,000
Friend!

2484
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:52,320
Baseline?

2485
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:52,720
Yeah!

2486
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:53,940
Before I...

2487
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:57,200
Before I like... you know, and then I'll do more defense stuff.

2488
02:03:57,740 --> 02:03:58,500
Da-do-da!

2489
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:02,400
Gain 1% EXP per 2 seconds when HP is full.

2490
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:06,940
The EXP rate slowly increases to 2% and is reset to 1% when taking damage.

2491
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:07,240
Oh!

2492
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:10,180
I think I'll take it.

2493
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:13,040
Oh my gosh!

2494
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:14,520
I hate!

2495
02:04:15,580 --> 02:04:16,180
Oh!

2496
02:04:17,930 --> 02:04:18,790
The vending machine!

2497
02:04:21,410 --> 02:04:22,010
Bloodthirsty!

2498
02:04:24,650 --> 02:04:25,850
Oh, but...

2499
02:04:41,780 --> 02:04:42,380
Oh!

2500
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:42,660
Oh!

2501
02:04:44,620 --> 02:04:46,360
Almost ran right into that.

2502
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:49,800
Friend, what are you doing?

2503
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:49,920
Come on!

2504
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:52,280
Oh!

2505
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:52,900
Hello?

2506
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:57,180
The ult is ready?

2507
02:04:57,280 --> 02:05:00,200
Yeah, but I like to use it only when I truly need it.

2508
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:00,640
You know what I mean?

2509
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:09,280
I'm wondering if I should do...

2510
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:11,340
Lab coat?

2511
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:13,140
I don't...

2512
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:14,580
I feel like I need some sort of defense.

2513
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,280
Like a...

2514
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:16,120
Like a passive defense.

2515
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:16,780
Like the...

2516
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:17,560
Cooking.

2517
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:20,860
You know?

2518
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:23,460
I think it's...

2519
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:23,960
I think I need to have...

2520
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:28,320
I'll apply this for now.

2521
02:05:29,060 --> 02:05:31,740
We'll have it for now and get you rid of it later.

2522
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:34,720
Akutan.

2523
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:36,580
Oh my gosh!

2524
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:38,680
Even the friend has the...

2525
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:39,900
The cooking!

2526
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:41,100
No way!

2527
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:42,140
That's so awesome!

2528
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:45,240
It applies to him too!

2529
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:48,360
That's so cool!

2530
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:53,020
That's so cool!

2531
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:53,080
That's so cool!

2532
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:53,400
That's so cool!

2533
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:53,960
Ult VTuber.

2534
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:55,080
VTuber!

2535
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:56,240
Your ult is ready!

2536
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:57,280
VTuber!

2537
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:58,900
Right click!

2538
02:05:59,020 --> 02:05:59,720
Right now!

2539
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:00,340
VTuber!

2540
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:03,280
The meter is full and flashing!

2541
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:03,760
VTuber!

2542
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:04,360
VTuber!

2543
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:05,940
There are two enemies on the screen!

2544
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:06,860
VTuber!

2545
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:08,660
Why don't you use your ult when there's two enemies?

2546
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,180
It can destroy them!

2547
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:11,780
VTuber!

2548
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:21,580
VTuber!

2549
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:22,620
VTuber!

2550
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:23,180
VTuber!

2551
02:06:23,180 --> 02:06:23,380
VTuber!

2552
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:25,680
I'm talking in the chat while you are playing the game.

2553
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:27,380
I am telling you what to do, VTuber.

2554
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:32,840
When you die and you did not notice my chat because you were playing the game, I will say, I told you so, VTuber.

2555
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:34,220
I told you in the chat.

2556
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:34,940
I typed it.

2557
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:37,700
I typed it in the chat, VTuber, and you did not listen to me.

2558
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:40,500
You deserve every death that you take.

2559
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:49,840
I don't know what the...

2560
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:50,800
Maybe the Whammy Water.

2561
02:06:51,060 --> 02:06:51,220
Wait.

2562
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:51,440
Okay.

2563
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:54,280
Whammy Water plus the...

2564
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:56,140
I

2565
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:00,600
don't know.

2566
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:02,860
I don't actually know if I've ever used this one before.

2567
02:07:07,450 --> 02:07:08,810
Water plus glow stick combined?

2568
02:07:09,190 --> 02:07:09,690
Oh, they do?

2569
02:07:13,010 --> 02:07:14,090
Why is it not here?

2570
02:07:22,050 --> 02:07:22,490
Scroll?

2571
02:07:22,650 --> 02:07:23,070
I am.

2572
02:07:23,270 --> 02:07:23,790
It's not working.

2573
02:07:24,590 --> 02:07:25,610
VTuber should have died.

2574
02:07:27,590 --> 02:07:28,730
Go away, Kay.

2575
02:07:31,850 --> 02:07:32,730
Go away!

2576
02:07:34,150 --> 02:07:35,530
I haven't discovered it yet.

2577
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:35,830
Oh!

2578
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:37,470
Okay.

2579
02:07:38,330 --> 02:07:40,090
Let's get the water and let's discover it.

2580
02:07:40,650 --> 02:07:41,490
Oh my gosh!

2581
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:43,450
We're going to discover something new together, you guys.

2582
02:07:44,090 --> 02:07:46,330
We're going to discover something new together.

2583
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:49,990
Discover something new together.

2584
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:51,170
You and me.

2585
02:07:55,690 --> 02:07:56,250
Wait.

2586
02:07:56,290 --> 02:07:56,570
What is this?

2587
02:07:56,710 --> 02:07:57,030
Decrease?

2588
02:07:57,130 --> 02:07:57,670
Oh.

2589
02:08:02,750 --> 02:08:04,750
You dare question the almighty chat?

2590
02:08:04,950 --> 02:08:07,010
Chat is correct all the time, every time.

2591
02:08:08,710 --> 02:08:09,270
No.

2592
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:12,760
No.

2593
02:08:12,780 --> 02:08:13,320
This is a new combination.

2594
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:15,780
Never seen before in the history of gaming.

2595
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:16,600
Exactly.

2596
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:16,900
Okay.

2597
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:18,320
Decrease damage of main weapon.

2598
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:18,620
Yeah.

2599
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:18,840
Yeah.

2600
02:08:18,860 --> 02:08:18,980
Yeah.

2601
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:19,120
Yeah.

2602
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:19,300
Okay.

2603
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:21,820
So I'm going to strengthen peko peko.

2604
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:25,500
Peko peko peko peko.

2605
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:27,520
I haven't done this civilization.

2606
02:08:32,190 --> 02:08:32,710
Oh.

2607
02:08:32,790 --> 02:08:33,190
Oh.

2608
02:08:33,330 --> 02:08:33,850
Wait.

2609
02:08:34,050 --> 02:08:34,570
Wait.

2610
02:08:34,590 --> 02:08:35,150
How was this done?

2611
02:08:35,450 --> 02:08:35,710
Ah!

2612
02:08:36,010 --> 02:08:36,530
Wait!

2613
02:08:37,410 --> 02:08:37,930
Water!

2614
02:08:38,390 --> 02:08:38,870
Wait!

2615
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:46,820
Water!

2616
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:50,860
Thanks for the dough!

2617
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:51,220
Ah!

2618
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:54,140
Oh, I'm cornered a little bit.

2619
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:55,580
One second.

2620
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:56,220
I'll read it.

2621
02:08:57,100 --> 02:08:58,060
I'll read it.

2622
02:08:58,120 --> 02:08:58,840
I'll read it.

2623
02:08:58,840 --> 02:08:59,520
I'll read it.

2624
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:00,800
I'll read it.

2625
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:01,220
I'll read it.

2626
02:09:01,220 --> 02:09:01,400
I'll read it.

2627
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:01,600
I'll read it.

2628
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:02,000
I'll read it.

2629
02:09:02,120 --> 02:09:02,520
Oh!

2630
02:09:02,820 --> 02:09:03,220
Money!

2631
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:03,460
Money!

2632
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:03,720
Money!

2633
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:04,000
Money!

2634
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:04,280
Money!

2635
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:04,520
Money!

2636
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:04,720
Money!

2637
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:09,520
Be sure to grab the sake if it pops up too.

2638
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:12,260
What?

2639
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:13,760
Why?

2640
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:15,860
Congratulations today, boss.

2641
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:16,880
What did I do?

2642
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:25,020
Two for sure, the nurse's horn.

2643
02:09:25,580 --> 02:09:29,280
Every time I get a special box, this one is always what I get.

2644
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,180
As the special item, you know?

2645
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:34,700
Horn pairs well with momai.

2646
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:38,120
Okay...

2647
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:38,380
Oi!

2648
02:09:38,580 --> 02:09:38,880
Oi!

2649
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:39,520
Oi!

2650
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:39,780
Oi!

2651
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:40,160
Oi!

2652
02:09:58,950 --> 02:10:01,030
Alt now, VTuber.

2653
02:10:03,170 --> 02:10:03,810
VTuber.

2654
02:10:05,150 --> 02:10:07,210
Alt now, VTuber.

2655
02:10:09,590 --> 02:10:10,230
VTuber.

2656
02:10:10,950 --> 02:10:12,790
Alt now, VTuber.

2657
02:10:13,150 --> 02:10:14,230
It is time.

2658
02:10:15,310 --> 02:10:15,950
VTuber.

2659
02:10:16,690 --> 02:10:19,070
It is I, Chadder.

2660
02:10:20,110 --> 02:10:21,790
I tell you...

2661
02:10:43,930 --> 02:10:45,410
I'm gonna go with the horn!

2662
02:10:45,930 --> 02:10:47,070
Where did...

2663
02:10:50,260 --> 02:10:51,800
That guy just stood there!

2664
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:15,030
That guy...

2665
02:11:17,110 --> 02:11:18,630
Works for me, baby!

2666
02:11:22,630 --> 02:11:23,870
Oh wait.

2667
02:11:26,030 --> 02:11:27,450
I was gonna say...

2668
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:34,880
Super chatata!

2669
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:37,900
A dead Gumball!

2670
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:38,860
Are you proud of me?

2671
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:43,460
Thank you for the 50!

2672
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:44,720
Thank you for the pink!

2673
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:45,580
Thank you so much!

2674
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:48,520
Oh...

2675
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:49,180
Oh...

2676
02:11:49,180 --> 02:11:49,800
Blalala...

2677
02:11:52,980 --> 02:11:54,360
All of these are...

2678
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:55,400
All of these are good.

2679
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:56,940
All of these are good.

2680
02:11:58,260 --> 02:11:59,320
All of these are good.

2681
02:11:59,380 --> 02:12:00,240
Oh my god, you guys...

2682
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:01,380
Thank you so much!

2683
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:06,820
I was gonna say 10, but I guess we are spending 150%!

2684
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:07,600
Thank you!

2685
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:09,880
Thank you!

2686
02:12:10,580 --> 02:12:11,300
One or two.

2687
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:13,280
Two... wait!

2688
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:14,400
Two other random weapons!

2689
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:15,300
80%... oh!

2690
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:16,380
I like that!

2691
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:18,420
I like those odds.

2692
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:23,360
Lose the 80% gotcha.

2693
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:29,230
I want to get the... there's some... yeah.

2694
02:12:32,330 --> 02:12:37,290
Yo buddy, I saw your post about how much you said Super Chats.

2695
02:12:37,370 --> 02:12:38,710
You need to calm down.

2696
02:12:39,450 --> 02:12:40,910
You need to calm down!

2697
02:12:44,910 --> 02:12:45,830
The Sake!

2698
02:12:46,770 --> 02:12:50,570
Gain 1% crit by every second up to 10%.

2699
02:12:52,610 --> 02:12:56,950
Sake is... so why... can someone explain why Sake is good with a Mumei?

2700
02:12:58,830 --> 02:13:00,870
It's definitely not buying the PS5.

2701
02:13:01,590 --> 02:13:02,930
Thank you for the Haku Super!

2702
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:04,190
Thank you!

2703
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:11,740
PSI... PSI... PS... PS... PS5 Pro.

2704
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:15,060
Thank you for the Haku Super!

2705
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:16,600
Thank you!

2706
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:20,040
It's like Kaito all over again.

2707
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:20,840
Super Chat time!

2708
02:13:25,540 --> 02:13:27,580
Sake Whammy Glow Stick.

2709
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:29,480
Oh!

2710
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:30,900
The Triple Whammy!

2711
02:13:32,860 --> 02:13:35,420
I find this to be a calming, cobbler.

2712
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:38,240
I like pink.

2713
02:13:38,540 --> 02:13:39,360
Thank you.

2714
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,020
Heard it was Super Chat time.

2715
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:44,480
Super Collab!

2716
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:45,440
OK.

2717
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:48,220
All right.

2718
02:13:48,420 --> 02:13:49,620
We got the Sake.

2719
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:50,620
OK.

2720
02:13:51,260 --> 02:13:52,060
Oh, oh, oh.

2721
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:52,880
Ouch!

2722
02:13:53,020 --> 02:13:53,180
Ouch!

2723
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:53,500
Ouch!

2724
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:53,800
Ouch!

2725
02:13:53,800 --> 02:13:54,100
Ouch!

2726
02:13:56,260 --> 02:13:57,640
Oh my goodness.

2727
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:07,720
Were we waiting on FanBeam?

2728
02:14:09,020 --> 02:14:09,620
No.

2729
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:11,980
We were doing... we were doing glow stick.

2730
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:14,400
Glow Stick Whammy.

2731
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:16,720
Sake.

2732
02:14:21,350 --> 02:14:22,490
What do I want to do?

2733
02:14:26,120 --> 02:14:27,320
Let's do my skills.

2734
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:28,440
Let's focus on the skills.

2735
02:14:29,220 --> 02:14:30,920
Let's focus on skills, baby.

2736
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:32,000
Skills, skills, skills.

2737
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:33,960
No skill issue here.

2738
02:14:37,120 --> 02:14:37,780
None at all.

2739
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:40,340
No skill issue here, everybody.

2740
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:45,040
Super, super chat time.

2741
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:45,580
Chat time, VTuber.

2742
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:49,100
Cutes the streamer, gets bullied by chat and gamedev.

2743
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:51,440
This is unfair.

2744
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:53,440
This is so unfair.

2745
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:58,200
Skills, skills, skills.

2746
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:00,660
Skills, skills, skills.

2747
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:01,880
Oh my gosh.

2748
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, where's the opening?

2749
02:15:11,870 --> 02:15:12,850
Stands for pinto.

2750
02:15:13,050 --> 02:15:13,770
Pinto beans.

2751
02:15:15,530 --> 02:15:16,630
Membership re-up time.

2752
02:15:16,790 --> 02:15:17,410
Does this count?

2753
02:15:17,650 --> 02:15:17,970
Thanks!

2754
02:15:18,050 --> 02:15:18,850
Exit victory!

2755
02:15:21,530 --> 02:15:22,250
Thank you!

2756
02:15:24,790 --> 02:15:26,090
For the body pillow?

2757
02:15:26,290 --> 02:15:28,150
But then I will have no more item slots.

2758
02:15:29,710 --> 02:15:31,730
You need body pillow since you have coat and sake?

2759
02:15:33,770 --> 02:15:34,890
Is that how that works?

2760
02:15:35,610 --> 02:15:37,590
The real otaku setup.

2761
02:15:37,830 --> 02:15:40,750
The glasses, the coat, the body pillow.

2762
02:15:40,970 --> 02:15:42,590
I will become the ultimate!

2763
02:15:57,120 --> 02:15:57,640
Alrighty.

2764
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:01,540
So glow stick.

2765
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:02,600
I'm gonna go with the glow stick.

2766
02:16:08,310 --> 02:16:11,010
This is just my whole afterlife, actually.

2767
02:16:13,370 --> 02:16:14,950
This is everything I live for.

2768
02:16:15,190 --> 02:16:16,670
Or, not live.

2769
02:16:18,030 --> 02:16:19,430
Everything I'm dead for?

2770
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:27,960
Unlife for.

2771
02:16:31,560 --> 02:16:34,120
I'm gonna actually go with the spider cooking.

2772
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:34,700
Okay...

2773
02:16:36,340 --> 02:16:39,220
Get- Ooyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoy.

2774
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:41,340
Ooyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoy.

2775
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:44,160
Oh my gosh.

2776
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:44,620
Oh my gosh.

2777
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:45,020
Oh my gosh.

2778
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:45,660
Please, please, please, please.

2779
02:16:49,620 --> 02:16:49,940
Nice.

2780
02:16:54,770 --> 02:16:56,070
Alt equals LB.

2781
02:17:01,570 --> 02:17:02,110
Thank you.

2782
02:17:04,690 --> 02:17:05,550
Forget the whammy.

2783
02:17:06,270 --> 02:17:06,870
Water up.

2784
02:17:09,070 --> 02:17:10,690
It is just water, right?

2785
02:17:20,890 --> 02:17:21,530
Yeah.

2786
02:17:22,770 --> 02:17:23,410
Yeah.

2787
02:17:31,080 --> 02:17:31,720
Oh.

2788
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:32,920
Okay.

2789
02:17:32,980 --> 02:17:35,260
If you're here, can you confirm or deny?

2790
02:17:37,320 --> 02:17:37,960
Okay.

2791
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:40,240
What is in the whammy water?

2792
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:42,020
The world wants to know.

2793
02:17:45,820 --> 02:17:46,480
Oh.

2794
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:47,940
Great.

2795
02:17:53,620 --> 02:18:04,180
Let's see what will happen.

2796
02:18:09,300 --> 02:18:10,860
It's a moment of a life for me.

2797
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:11,520
Let's see.

2798
02:18:11,660 --> 02:18:11,880
It's a moment of a life for me.

2799
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:12,000
Whoa.

2800
02:18:14,060 --> 02:18:14,720
It's not working.

2801
02:18:14,720 --> 02:18:15,380
Oh, it doesn't work.

2802
02:18:15,380 --> 02:18:16,440
There's a Youtube fan.

2803
02:18:16,480 --> 02:18:16,880
What was the worst thing in this video?

2804
02:18:26,170 --> 02:18:30,190
Guys, we are so movin'!

2805
02:18:30,190 --> 02:18:32,130
We are so movin'!

2806
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:44,060
We're gonna be rich, baby!

2807
02:18:44,380 --> 02:18:45,280
Rich, rich!

2808
02:18:45,480 --> 02:18:46,540
Oh, glow stick max!

2809
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:58,380
Okay.

2810
02:19:08,260 --> 02:19:09,240
So far, so good.

2811
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:11,320
And Bill!

2812
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:12,100
Where was it?

2813
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,700
Umm... I'm looking for the arrow.

2814
02:19:15,900 --> 02:19:16,320
I'm blind.

2815
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:18,040
I'm looking for the arrow.

2816
02:19:18,140 --> 02:19:18,820
Oh, I see the arrow!

2817
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:20,160
Thank you!

2818
02:19:25,910 --> 02:19:30,110
Umm... probably Whammy... Actually...

2819
02:19:31,950 --> 02:19:32,870
Enchant Whammy?

2820
02:19:37,250 --> 02:19:37,710
Okay.

2821
02:19:37,710 --> 02:19:38,870
I'm trusting you guys.

2822
02:19:43,140 --> 02:19:43,960
Enchant the water.

2823
02:19:47,400 --> 02:19:50,740
Holy moly, I just noticed how many... how many pen lights.

2824
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:51,540
Oh my gosh!

2825
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:53,620
Ouch!

2826
02:19:53,980 --> 02:19:54,300
Ouch!

2827
02:19:54,340 --> 02:19:54,560
Ouch!

2828
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:54,740
Ouch!

2829
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:55,040
Ouch!

2830
02:19:55,440 --> 02:19:55,760
Ouch!

2831
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,600
Oh my gosh.

2832
02:20:00,940 --> 02:20:02,000
I had to.

2833
02:20:02,220 --> 02:20:03,200
I felt like I had to.

2834
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:04,120
I felt like I had to.

2835
02:20:04,420 --> 02:20:05,420
I felt like I had to.

2836
02:20:05,820 --> 02:20:06,440
Oh my gosh!

2837
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:07,260
Okay.

2838
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:09,680
I knew there was some... I knew I had health over there.

2839
02:20:10,540 --> 02:20:12,420
But we're getting kind of cornered over here.

2840
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:13,420
Not very good.

2841
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:14,380
Not a very good situation.

2842
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:15,720
Okay.

2843
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:16,720
A little better.

2844
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:17,300
There we go.

2845
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:17,920
Okay.

2846
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:18,640
We're okay.

2847
02:20:18,820 --> 02:20:19,560
We're okay, maybe.

2848
02:20:19,820 --> 02:20:20,100
Oh!

2849
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:20,720
Pizza!

2850
02:20:20,820 --> 02:20:21,100
Pizza!

2851
02:20:21,140 --> 02:20:21,380
Pizza!

2852
02:20:22,220 --> 02:20:22,620
Oh!

2853
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:23,020
Pizza!

2854
02:20:23,100 --> 02:20:23,320
Pizza!

2855
02:20:25,060 --> 02:20:27,360
Sometimes I think my friend is an enemy.

2856
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:30,600
Oh shit.

2857
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:31,600
Umm... Oh.

2858
02:20:31,660 --> 02:20:32,280
Oh my gosh.

2859
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,320
Okay.

2860
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:34,720
Alright.

2861
02:20:34,820 --> 02:20:35,080
We're alright.

2862
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:35,480
We're okay.

2863
02:20:35,640 --> 02:20:36,200
We're okay.

2864
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:41,040
We're okay.

2865
02:20:41,140 --> 02:20:41,360
We're okay.

2866
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:48,520
This isn't Little Caesars.

2867
02:20:49,420 --> 02:20:50,640
This is Wendy's.

2868
02:21:01,090 --> 02:21:02,970
I'm like trying to aim for... at her?

2869
02:21:04,790 --> 02:21:05,570
Oh my gosh.

2870
02:21:05,710 --> 02:21:06,350
Oh my gosh.

2871
02:21:10,260 --> 02:21:12,020
I need... I need more health.

2872
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:13,120
Yay!

2873
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:17,060
Okay.

2874
02:21:24,650 --> 02:21:26,990
I'm gonna do the Whammy Water.

2875
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:34,640
Yay!

2876
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:40,800
Let's just start cooking.

2877
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:42,340
We're cooking.

2878
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:42,820
We're cooking.

2879
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:43,320
We're cooking.

2880
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:43,780
We're cooking.

2881
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:44,460
Oh, wait.

2882
02:21:44,520 --> 02:21:45,140
I'm gonna save that.

2883
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:47,020
I don't like these guys.

2884
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:47,520
They're so...

2885
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:47,720
Oh!

2886
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:48,200
Wait!

2887
02:21:48,820 --> 02:21:49,580
Can I...

2888
02:21:51,420 --> 02:21:52,400
This and this, right?

2889
02:21:52,480 --> 02:21:52,960
There we go.

2890
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:57,340
Snowflower Sake!

2891
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:01,540
Okay.

2892
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:03,740
Throw a bottle that shatters into snowflake.

2893
02:22:04,140 --> 02:22:06,220
Has 38% chance to cause Frozen!

2894
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:09,220
Whoa!

2895
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:10,040
Whoa!

2896
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:10,700
Whoa!

2897
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:11,080
Whoa!

2898
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:11,960
Whoa!

2899
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:12,760
Whoa!

2900
02:22:12,820 --> 02:22:13,000
Whoa!

2901
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:15,760
This is actually so good for all these tiny little annoying guys.

2902
02:22:17,620 --> 02:22:19,780
All these tiny annoying guys down here.

2903
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:42,200
Let's get this up.

2904
02:22:46,540 --> 02:22:47,020
Whoa!

2905
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:47,400
Whoa!

2906
02:22:47,460 --> 02:22:47,620
Whoa!

2907
02:22:54,460 --> 02:22:54,940
Um...

2908
02:22:59,150 --> 02:22:59,790
I know.

2909
02:22:59,850 --> 02:23:01,890
We're like leveling up like crazy right now.

2910
02:23:01,890 --> 02:23:03,590
This is actually kind of insane.

2911
02:23:05,330 --> 02:23:05,650
Three?

2912
02:23:06,050 --> 02:23:06,990
Just keep going, Sake?

2913
02:23:07,110 --> 02:23:07,430
Oh, yeah.

2914
02:23:07,510 --> 02:23:07,750
Yeah.

2915
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:09,170
Because we gotta level it up.

2916
02:23:09,230 --> 02:23:11,110
We gotta max it out so we can do the Ultra...

2917
02:23:12,610 --> 02:23:13,570
Ultra collab, right?

2918
02:23:13,770 --> 02:23:14,390
Yes, yes, yes.

2919
02:23:14,850 --> 02:23:15,470
Yes, yes, yes.

2920
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:15,790
I know.

2921
02:23:15,870 --> 02:23:16,070
I know.

2922
02:23:19,530 --> 02:23:20,470
Oh, let's swap.

2923
02:23:23,470 --> 02:23:23,790
Swap.

2924
02:23:23,850 --> 02:23:24,650
And then...

2925
02:23:25,010 --> 02:23:27,230
Because... Well, we still have three empty weapon slots.

2926
02:23:27,370 --> 02:23:29,250
But let's do...

2927
02:23:30,070 --> 02:23:30,390
Decreed?

2928
02:23:32,450 --> 02:23:32,930
Okay.

2929
02:23:33,370 --> 02:23:34,350
Let's Strength and Greed.

2930
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:36,550
Money, money, money!

2931
02:23:37,930 --> 02:23:38,890
Money, money...

2932
02:23:38,890 --> 02:23:39,290
Whoa!

2933
02:23:39,550 --> 02:23:40,290
Oh, my gosh.

2934
02:23:41,070 --> 02:23:43,210
Money, money, money, baby!

2935
02:23:44,130 --> 02:23:45,810
Oh, money, money, money.

2936
02:23:49,310 --> 02:23:49,790
Seymour!

2937
02:23:49,790 --> 02:23:50,410
Thanks for the five!

2938
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:50,930
Get the head!

2939
02:24:04,550 --> 02:24:05,030
Next...

2940
02:24:05,030 --> 02:24:11,050
Next, I'll work on the cooking next time so that we can get it maxed out, you know?

2941
02:24:12,010 --> 02:24:13,590
I want to max it.

2942
02:24:13,630 --> 02:24:14,570
I want to max it.

2943
02:24:14,610 --> 02:24:15,370
Holy cow!

2944
02:24:16,530 --> 02:24:16,970
Ta-ta-ta!

2945
02:24:17,430 --> 02:24:18,110
Ta-ta-ta!

2946
02:24:18,270 --> 02:24:18,730
Ta-ta-ta!

2947
02:24:21,630 --> 02:24:22,030
Ni...

2948
02:24:22,030 --> 02:24:22,790
Oh, wait.

2949
02:24:22,890 --> 02:24:23,090
Sake.

2950
02:24:23,230 --> 02:24:23,830
Just kidding.

2951
02:24:26,070 --> 02:24:27,310
Just kidding, just kidding.

2952
02:24:27,570 --> 02:24:28,330
Okay, next time.

2953
02:24:28,630 --> 02:24:29,370
I promise.

2954
02:24:29,630 --> 02:24:30,810
Next time, next time, next time.

2955
02:24:32,770 --> 02:24:33,470
Ta-ta-ta!

2956
02:24:35,570 --> 02:24:36,310
It's beautiful!

2957
02:24:36,310 --> 02:24:36,530
Beautiful!

2958
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:45,980
Why are they still moving when they're frozen?

2959
02:24:52,410 --> 02:24:53,570
Oh, with the body pillow.

2960
02:24:58,300 --> 02:24:58,700
Inertia.

2961
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:02,220
Dedication.

2962
02:25:05,300 --> 02:25:07,140
I said I would do the spider cooking.

2963
02:25:07,360 --> 02:25:07,940
I think I'm gonna...

2964
02:25:07,940 --> 02:25:10,440
I really want to max that one out so we can get it off the board.

2965
02:25:15,420 --> 02:25:16,800
Saving all that down there.

2966
02:25:19,300 --> 02:25:19,780
Max!

2967
02:25:31,220 --> 02:25:32,420
Ultimate Oshii combo.

2968
02:25:32,580 --> 02:25:34,900
Mint playing Holokura's Mumei and got the whammy one.

2969
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:40,900
Aren't you just a winning Vijai?

2970
02:25:42,660 --> 02:25:44,480
Glad that I can play your Oshii!

2971
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:44,560
Please!

2972
02:25:53,140 --> 02:25:54,260
Come on!

2973
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:55,040
Come on!

2974
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:55,920
Come on!

2975
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:56,660
Come on!

2976
02:25:57,500 --> 02:26:00,600
I don't want to get that health just yet, but I want the XP.

2977
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:02,320
Oh, here we go.

2978
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:03,860
Um, oh!

2979
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:04,980
Researcher's Coat.

2980
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:10,280
Chuu!

2981
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:12,880
Arigato!

2982
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:13,320
Arigato!

2983
02:26:13,540 --> 02:26:13,900
Chuu!

2984
02:26:14,220 --> 02:26:14,760
Thank you!

2985
02:26:19,210 --> 02:26:20,650
For as the kids say...

2986
02:26:28,070 --> 02:26:30,610
I'm really glad to be able to see you enjoying this game.

2987
02:26:30,710 --> 02:26:31,250
It suits you!

2988
02:26:32,070 --> 02:26:35,050
I don't know what suits me about it, but...

2989
02:26:38,130 --> 02:26:38,930
Thank you!

2990
02:26:40,930 --> 02:26:44,490
Oh, since we have this, we should do the lava bucket, right?

2991
02:26:45,890 --> 02:26:49,770
I don't think anything else combines, right?

2992
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:51,050
Oh yeah, I wanted to see.

2993
02:26:51,970 --> 02:26:53,190
Oh, it is here now!

2994
02:26:54,890 --> 02:26:55,630
Very cool.

2995
02:27:05,190 --> 02:27:06,150
Now we...

2996
02:27:06,710 --> 02:27:09,430
We don't get burned by our own pizza, right?

2997
02:27:11,550 --> 02:27:14,430
I can walk on my own pizza, right?

2998
02:27:16,490 --> 02:27:17,270
Pizza's ready!

2999
02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:19,070
No?

3000
02:27:19,210 --> 02:27:19,430
Okay.

3001
02:27:19,630 --> 02:27:21,230
I figured that was the case.

3002
02:27:21,410 --> 02:27:22,910
I just wanted to be sure, you know?

3003
02:27:24,770 --> 02:27:25,690
Just wanted to be sure.

3004
02:27:25,710 --> 02:27:27,350
I'm gonna actually level up our body pillow.

3005
02:27:29,310 --> 02:27:31,750
So we can have more defense stuffs going on.

3006
02:27:35,910 --> 02:27:36,610
Oh my gosh.

3007
02:27:36,690 --> 02:27:37,310
Oh my gosh.

3008
02:27:43,090 --> 02:27:43,450
Super?

3009
02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:44,870
No, I don't think I need to.

3010
02:27:45,490 --> 02:27:46,250
I think I'm okay.

3011
02:27:47,830 --> 02:27:49,570
Wait, Super, why do you step on the pizza?

3012
02:27:50,790 --> 02:27:52,010
Step on the pizza!

3013
02:27:52,330 --> 02:27:53,730
Yeah, I don't need the super right now.

3014
02:27:53,770 --> 02:27:54,250
We're all good.

3015
02:27:56,050 --> 02:27:56,410
Hammer?

3016
02:27:56,530 --> 02:27:56,730
Oh!

3017
02:27:56,910 --> 02:27:57,550
I see it!

3018
02:27:57,550 --> 02:27:57,870
I see it!

3019
02:27:57,930 --> 02:27:58,210
I see it!

3020
02:27:58,290 --> 02:27:58,550
I see it!

3021
02:27:58,550 --> 02:27:59,030
It's right there!

3022
02:27:59,130 --> 02:27:59,330
Right there!

3023
02:27:59,350 --> 02:28:00,390
Right there!

3024
02:28:00,650 --> 02:28:00,970
Wait.

3025
02:28:21,490 --> 02:28:22,650
Oh, I can't do it yet!

3026
02:28:26,760 --> 02:28:27,240
Oh wait!

3027
02:28:27,320 --> 02:28:28,000
I can do it!

3028
02:28:29,260 --> 02:28:30,220
I can do it!

3029
02:28:30,220 --> 02:28:30,680
I can do it!

3030
02:28:30,740 --> 02:28:31,780
Oh, I didn't realize it would appear.

3031
02:28:32,040 --> 02:28:32,220
Okay.

3032
02:28:33,020 --> 02:28:33,620
Here we go.

3033
02:28:34,180 --> 02:28:34,540
Let's go!

3034
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:39,140
Snow Queen!

3035
02:28:39,820 --> 02:28:42,060
Freeze everything around, dealing constant damage!

3036
02:28:42,340 --> 02:28:44,660
Also increases crit chance by 20%!

3037
02:28:47,240 --> 02:28:49,140
That's my first time using the golden hammer!

3038
02:28:49,300 --> 02:28:50,240
I've tried to get it before.

3039
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:55,840
Like in other games, I've gotten it in like little pieces at a time.

3040
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:57,720
But I've never gotten the full hammer before.

3041
02:29:03,610 --> 02:29:05,410
Oh my gosh, and that frees up a slot!

3042
02:29:06,230 --> 02:29:07,130
That's so awesome!

3043
02:29:09,690 --> 02:29:11,510
Oh, level 50 is required!

3044
02:29:11,990 --> 02:29:12,150
Wait!

3045
02:29:12,290 --> 02:29:13,350
Oh, I see!

3046
02:29:13,410 --> 02:29:13,590
I see!

3047
02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:14,670
But so then...

3048
02:29:15,210 --> 02:29:18,170
When I was getting it piece by piece before...

3049
02:29:19,130 --> 02:29:21,130
When I was getting it piece by piece before...

3050
02:29:29,330 --> 02:29:30,750
Enchant the lava... Oh, that's so true.

3051
02:29:30,930 --> 02:29:31,850
Enchant the lava, yeah.

3052
02:29:33,090 --> 02:29:34,830
Why... Was it just because I was...

3053
02:29:36,890 --> 02:29:39,470
Well, either 50 or 3 collabs.

3054
02:29:40,770 --> 02:29:42,470
You gain a piece for every collab.

3055
02:29:42,690 --> 02:29:43,590
Oh, I see!

3056
02:29:43,710 --> 02:29:43,890
I see!

3057
02:29:43,990 --> 02:29:44,190
I see!

3058
02:29:47,990 --> 02:29:49,910
I'm learning so much.

3059
02:29:52,390 --> 02:29:52,930
Idle.

3060
02:29:52,990 --> 02:29:53,570
Oh, wait.

3061
02:30:04,480 --> 02:30:05,660
But that cooled out.

3062
02:30:06,300 --> 02:30:07,240
I have a question.

3063
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:09,540
For Mumei's ult...

3064
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:11,740
Have people said that it doesn't kill...

3065
02:30:11,740 --> 02:30:13,980
Like, obviously it doesn't one-shot a boss.

3066
02:30:14,220 --> 02:30:15,940
But does the boss still take damage?

3067
02:30:23,070 --> 02:30:23,950
I'm just curious.

3068
02:30:26,250 --> 02:30:26,970
No damage.

3069
02:30:27,510 --> 02:30:28,210
Boss immune.

3070
02:30:28,530 --> 02:30:29,390
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3071
02:30:30,510 --> 02:30:31,350
Okay, okay, okay.

3072
02:30:35,970 --> 02:30:36,410
Guys?

3073
02:30:38,610 --> 02:30:39,750
If I die, I die!

3074
02:30:42,190 --> 02:30:43,670
I'm the captain of this ship!

3075
02:30:44,290 --> 02:30:46,370
I will go down with this ship!

3076
02:30:47,150 --> 02:30:47,930
Too late, Oh-Wey!

3077
02:30:49,190 --> 02:30:49,870
WHOA!

3078
02:30:50,570 --> 02:30:51,250
...

3079
02:30:54,540 --> 02:30:55,900
And it's all...

3080
02:30:55,900 --> 02:30:59,980
It's a cold night, just like Titanic and Alaska.

3081
02:31:01,240 --> 02:31:03,020
Maybe this is a Metal Gear reference.

3082
02:31:07,880 --> 02:31:13,780
I know you guys probably wanted me to upgrade the holo, but I want to get the bucket first, okay?

3083
02:31:29,510 --> 02:31:30,070
Anyway...

3084
02:31:34,720 --> 02:31:36,280
Welcome to Shadow Moses.

3085
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:43,260
I probably shouldn't upgrade it anymore, right?

3086
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:48,700
Or rather, upgrading it is going to be scary, right?

3087
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:51,360
If I do so...

3088
02:31:56,820 --> 02:31:58,020
Upgrade holo last.

3089
02:31:58,880 --> 02:31:59,520
Okay.

3090
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:01,220
I understand.

3091
02:32:02,440 --> 02:32:03,400
I understand!

3092
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:07,660
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo...

3093
02:32:11,500 --> 02:32:12,660
Take him out!

3094
02:32:12,740 --> 02:32:13,120
Take him out!

3095
02:32:14,120 --> 02:32:16,680
Oh, he's fast!

3096
02:32:18,320 --> 02:32:18,840
Sheesh!

3097
02:32:20,260 --> 02:32:21,220
What do we grab?

3098
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:22,280
Asakoko maybe?

3099
02:32:24,900 --> 02:32:26,320
Never go full holo.

3100
02:32:35,670 --> 02:32:36,190
One.

3101
02:32:51,160 --> 02:32:51,880
There it is.

3102
02:32:56,190 --> 02:32:56,590
Hello?

3103
02:32:57,010 --> 02:32:57,670
Oh, there it is.

3104
02:32:58,990 --> 02:32:59,390
Howdy.

3105
02:32:59,670 --> 02:33:00,070
Howdy!

3106
02:33:11,260 --> 02:33:14,880
I could still do the BL book and the Psycho Axe.

3107
02:33:28,300 --> 02:33:31,160
Well, I don't even think I'll be able to do it in time.

3108
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:32,440
Where is... oh, here's the stars.

3109
02:33:32,820 --> 02:33:35,760
I was like, didn't I save some stars before for my ult?

3110
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:39,020
Oh my gosh.

3111
02:33:39,440 --> 02:33:40,740
They're coming from all angles!

3112
02:33:45,790 --> 02:33:47,730
Yeah, I don't really have a lot of time left.

3113
02:33:49,850 --> 02:33:51,730
I could try for it.

3114
02:33:51,890 --> 02:33:53,310
I do get a lot of experience.

3115
02:33:56,090 --> 02:33:58,830
I do get a lot of experience now.

3116
02:33:59,230 --> 02:33:59,930
Oh my gosh.

3117
02:34:00,870 --> 02:34:01,890
Yago, you scared me.

3118
02:34:03,630 --> 02:34:05,030
The RGB stuff!

3119
02:34:10,460 --> 02:34:11,920
But we got a max greed.

3120
02:34:17,420 --> 02:34:18,980
As much as I want the RGB.

3121
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:22,060
Greed comes first.

3122
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:29,560
Money, money, money, money, money.

3123
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:31,640
Money, money, money, money, money.

3124
02:34:34,120 --> 02:34:34,520
Money!

3125
02:34:35,560 --> 02:34:37,720
I feel like I don't really need to move much.

3126
02:34:37,760 --> 02:34:39,600
I can just kind of aim and...

3127
02:34:42,960 --> 02:34:46,180
I'll go and collect stuff, you know, when I need to.

3128
02:35:07,900 --> 02:35:09,260
Friend will do collection.

3129
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:25,080
Oh, fanbeam is... has the extra... yeah, it has the...

3130
02:35:26,220 --> 02:35:27,860
The blue.

3131
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:37,940
Let's...

3132
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:42,660
Yeah.

3133
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:45,100
I wanna max Asakoko!

3134
02:35:54,150 --> 02:35:56,200
You already did the Asakoko fanbeam.

3135
02:35:58,960 --> 02:35:59,740
What do you mean?

3136
02:36:00,620 --> 02:36:01,200
Like here?

3137
02:36:02,480 --> 02:36:03,040
This one?

3138
02:36:03,480 --> 02:36:03,920
Yeah.

3139
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:09,140
We have done that.

3140
02:36:11,060 --> 02:36:15,260
You can upgrade Halu since your super super chatto gives you extra ATK.

3141
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:18,360
Yeah, but I'm still scared.

3142
02:36:20,480 --> 02:36:21,680
Asakoko and bomb, though.

3143
02:36:21,800 --> 02:36:23,400
Let's just do Asakoko for now.

3144
02:36:25,080 --> 02:36:27,260
Let's max for now and then we can...

3145
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:30,540
Trying not to grab the health.

3146
02:36:34,660 --> 02:36:35,040
Wait.

3147
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:37,760
What's that sound?

3148
02:36:38,120 --> 02:36:38,800
What's that sound?

3149
02:36:39,080 --> 02:36:39,840
What's that sound?

3150
02:36:39,960 --> 02:36:40,600
What's that sound?

3151
02:36:42,980 --> 02:36:43,800
Oh, here we go.

3152
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:45,400
Okay, now we have to make a real decision.

3153
02:36:54,310 --> 02:36:56,130
Is the bomb the guy coming towards me?

3154
02:37:01,350 --> 02:37:04,490
People are saying bomb and the tail are... are those...

3155
02:37:04,490 --> 02:37:06,390
Well, I mean, I don't think I'll have time to...

3156
02:37:06,390 --> 02:37:07,410
You know...

3157
02:37:07,950 --> 02:37:08,310
To?

3158
02:37:08,470 --> 02:37:08,730
Okay.

3159
02:37:09,590 --> 02:37:09,950
Run!

3160
02:37:18,140 --> 02:37:18,800
Oh my gosh.

3161
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:19,760
Wait, what's happening?

3162
02:37:20,900 --> 02:37:21,260
Oh

3163
02:37:30,880 --> 02:37:31,060
my god.

3164
02:37:31,420 --> 02:37:31,980
He's frozen?

3165
02:37:32,340 --> 02:37:32,700
Oh.

3166
02:37:39,470 --> 02:37:40,070
We did it?

3167
02:37:40,670 --> 02:37:41,190
I think?

3168
02:37:52,240 --> 02:37:55,000
My bombs!

3169
02:37:55,440 --> 02:37:56,120
Oh my gosh.

3170
02:37:56,120 --> 02:37:57,120
I thought it was their bombs.

3171
02:37:57,160 --> 02:37:58,180
I was freaking out for a second.

3172
02:37:58,220 --> 02:37:58,720
I'm not gonna lie.

3173
02:38:00,740 --> 02:38:01,580
I'm not gonna lie.

3174
02:38:01,660 --> 02:38:03,400
I was freaking out for a second, you guys.

3175
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:04,320
I thought...

3176
02:38:06,220 --> 02:38:07,220
Those are my bombs.

3177
02:38:17,950 --> 02:38:19,790
Maybe I increase my critical.

3178
02:38:21,890 --> 02:38:22,370
Maybe.

3179
02:38:26,390 --> 02:38:27,970
Or we could just keep going with the bomb.

3180
02:38:28,670 --> 02:38:29,150
Actually...

3181
02:38:30,130 --> 02:38:32,450
If we keep going with the bomb...

3182
02:38:37,880 --> 02:38:38,360
Flower.

3183
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:41,500
Yeah, go for three collabs.

3184
02:38:41,580 --> 02:38:41,800
Yeah.

3185
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:43,360
We already have greed maxed.

3186
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:43,880
So...

3187
02:38:44,740 --> 02:38:45,220
Um...

3188
02:38:45,220 --> 02:38:46,160
Okay.

3189
02:38:46,480 --> 02:38:46,960
Okay.

3190
02:38:46,960 --> 02:38:47,540
Let's try three collabs.

3191
02:38:47,540 --> 02:38:48,000
Cause an explosion.

3192
02:38:49,440 --> 02:38:50,120
Or...

3193
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:51,080
Reduce...

3194
02:38:51,080 --> 02:38:53,240
Let's go with this one.

3195
02:38:53,540 --> 02:38:54,360
Pickle, pickle.

3196
02:38:56,560 --> 02:38:58,200
Alright, let's try and...

3197
02:38:58,200 --> 02:38:59,300
Three collabs, baby!

3198
02:39:01,380 --> 02:39:02,740
Three collabs!

3199
02:39:02,760 --> 02:39:03,440
Baby.

3200
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:05,200
Maybe.

3201
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:06,920
Baby, maybe.

3202
02:39:07,220 --> 02:39:07,400
Oh!

3203
02:39:13,740 --> 02:39:14,780
Good timing.

3204
02:39:15,960 --> 02:39:17,300
I'm gonna go back this way.

3205
02:39:20,500 --> 02:39:21,380
I don't like this.

3206
02:39:21,400 --> 02:39:24,560
I don't want to be caught in like all the areas with all the tables and stuff.

3207
02:39:24,700 --> 02:39:25,400
It's too difficult.

3208
02:39:27,340 --> 02:39:28,280
It's too hard.

3209
02:39:30,100 --> 02:39:31,280
Are you winning, Minto?

3210
02:39:31,440 --> 02:39:32,120
I think finally.

3211
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:33,480
Maybe.

3212
02:39:35,580 --> 02:39:36,100
MAX!

3213
02:39:36,780 --> 02:39:37,300
MAX!

3214
02:39:37,560 --> 02:39:38,000
MAX!

3215
02:39:38,220 --> 02:39:38,740
MAX!

3216
02:39:39,660 --> 02:39:40,180
MAXIMIZER!

3217
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:41,280
MAXIMIZER!

3218
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:47,680
Oh!

3219
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:48,440
There it is!

3220
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:52,080
Okay.

3221
02:39:52,500 --> 02:39:52,980
Wait.

3222
02:39:53,940 --> 02:39:57,160
But my holo bomb is not...

3223
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:00,520
It's not enchanted.

3224
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:03,280
Does it matter if something is enchanted beforehand or not?

3225
02:40:06,180 --> 02:40:08,720
Does it... It's fine?

3226
02:40:08,820 --> 02:40:09,160
Does it matter?

3227
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:09,620
Oh, okay.

3228
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:11,100
Ta-da!

3229
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:15,420
Breathe in type Asakaka!

3230
02:40:16,580 --> 02:40:18,240
I don't know what this does, but...

3231
02:40:20,420 --> 02:40:21,640
I don't know what this does.

3232
02:40:21,720 --> 02:40:22,620
I don't know what's going on.

3233
02:40:24,860 --> 02:40:26,900
What do I even... What do I even do?

3234
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:31,120
What do I even... What do I even do here?

3235
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:53,880
I wish there was a speed up.

3236
02:40:58,570 --> 02:41:01,150
What is even the point of me going here?

3237
02:41:02,130 --> 02:41:02,710
Oh my god.

3238
02:41:02,770 --> 02:41:03,510
Run, run, run, run, run, run!

3239
02:41:03,650 --> 02:41:03,870
Okay.

3240
02:41:07,510 --> 02:41:08,970
Oh, oh gosh!

3241
02:41:10,130 --> 02:41:10,490
Toho!

3242
02:41:10,690 --> 02:41:11,050
Toho!

3243
02:41:11,230 --> 02:41:11,550
Toho!

3244
02:41:11,610 --> 02:41:11,890
Toho!

3245
02:41:12,090 --> 02:41:13,050
Not the Danmaku!

3246
02:41:13,490 --> 02:41:14,270
Oh my god, please.

3247
02:41:14,550 --> 02:41:15,730
Not the Danmaku, please.

3248
02:41:20,820 --> 02:41:21,800
Am I even hitting her?

3249
02:41:21,860 --> 02:41:22,260
I don't know.

3250
02:41:22,340 --> 02:41:23,640
I don't even know if I'm reaching her.

3251
02:41:28,700 --> 02:41:29,740
Oh, there she is.

3252
02:41:31,940 --> 02:41:32,300
Toho!

3253
02:41:33,020 --> 02:41:35,510
Oh my gosh!

3254
02:41:35,610 --> 02:41:35,930
Ouch!

3255
02:41:35,930 --> 02:41:36,150
Ouch!

3256
02:41:36,270 --> 02:41:36,350
Ouch!

3257
02:41:36,350 --> 02:41:36,450
Ouch!

3258
02:41:36,450 --> 02:41:36,650
Ouch, ouch!

3259
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:42,510
Are you sure about this?

3260
02:41:48,080 --> 02:41:49,160
It's eichuuun.

3261
02:41:53,080 --> 02:41:55,900
Wait, does this count for the bosses too?

3262
02:41:56,040 --> 02:41:57,700
Even if they become 33 percent stronger?

3263
02:42:05,990 --> 02:42:07,170
Only little guys.

3264
02:42:07,510 --> 02:42:08,010
Oh, okay.

3265
02:42:15,030 --> 02:42:16,570
I know this...

3266
02:42:20,330 --> 02:42:22,170
Where is my cursor, there it is.

3267
02:42:22,190 --> 02:42:22,330
Okay.

3268
02:42:23,450 --> 02:42:23,970
Oh!

3269
02:42:24,210 --> 02:42:24,970
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3270
02:42:24,970 --> 02:42:25,210
Oh!

3271
02:42:25,210 --> 02:42:26,270
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3272
02:42:26,530 --> 02:42:27,330
Oh my gosh.

3273
02:42:27,710 --> 02:42:28,570
For real.

3274
02:42:28,750 --> 02:42:29,110
For real.

3275
02:42:29,230 --> 02:42:32,170
We did it!

3276
02:42:36,580 --> 02:42:37,560
I forgore.

3277
02:42:46,370 --> 02:42:48,730
That was like... peak gaming.

3278
02:42:50,010 --> 02:42:52,030
Fires rapid tears at random targets.

3279
02:42:56,090 --> 02:42:58,650
Lose three Holo Coins every second!

3280
02:42:58,790 --> 02:42:59,730
If Holo Coins is...

3281
02:43:00,370 --> 02:43:01,290
More than zero...

3282
02:43:02,250 --> 02:43:05,010
Increase attack by 30% and take 10% less...

3283
02:43:05,010 --> 02:43:05,510
Holy!

3284
02:43:05,830 --> 02:43:06,490
That's...

3285
02:43:08,230 --> 02:43:09,190
Hard stage.

3286
02:43:09,810 --> 02:43:10,530
Yay!

3287
02:43:15,050 --> 02:43:15,850
8-chan.

3288
02:43:16,030 --> 02:43:16,670
07.

3289
02:43:18,910 --> 02:43:19,950
Join the membership.

3290
02:43:21,790 --> 02:43:22,630
Losing...

3291
02:43:22,630 --> 02:43:24,850
Losing every second is diabolical.

3292
02:43:27,150 --> 02:43:28,830
It's diabolical.

3293
02:43:28,890 --> 02:43:29,270
Seriously.

3294
02:43:31,050 --> 02:43:32,630
Start creating things for the 10 gifted!

3295
02:43:34,470 --> 02:43:35,510
30% attack.

3296
02:43:35,670 --> 02:43:37,270
Negative 10% damage.

3297
02:43:42,290 --> 02:43:43,510
Membership can be really good though.

3298
02:43:43,570 --> 02:43:44,290
I can... I imagine.

3299
02:43:45,050 --> 02:43:46,610
If we do Gacha...

3300
02:43:47,770 --> 02:43:49,150
There's so many people I'm missing.

3301
02:43:49,590 --> 02:43:50,670
Who do you think...

3302
02:43:50,670 --> 02:43:52,150
Who do you guys think I should aim for?

3303
02:43:54,170 --> 02:43:55,650
Who do you guys think I should aim for?

3304
02:43:55,710 --> 02:43:57,970
I really like playing as Mumei.

3305
02:43:59,190 --> 02:44:00,350
I really like playing as Mumei.

3306
02:44:10,990 --> 02:44:13,430
Oh my gosh, Liquid Toast.

3307
02:44:13,510 --> 02:44:15,630
Your name reminded me...

3308
02:44:17,430 --> 02:44:21,190
When I was coming back from Japan, when I was at...

3309
02:44:21,190 --> 02:44:23,830
When I was at...

3310
02:44:24,350 --> 02:44:25,550
Oh my gosh, what's it called?

3311
02:44:25,550 --> 02:44:28,370
The customs!

3312
02:44:29,750 --> 02:44:34,390
I have the global entry or whatever.

3313
02:44:35,630 --> 02:44:38,790
And they were just shouting people's names.

3314
02:44:39,390 --> 02:44:43,110
You kind of register and it made the line go so fast.

3315
02:44:43,590 --> 02:44:44,150
ASCII?

3316
02:44:44,370 --> 02:44:45,210
Okay, I'll try ASCII.

3317
02:44:45,270 --> 02:44:46,490
I see Korone, I see ASCII.

3318
02:44:47,510 --> 02:44:48,150
But...

3319
02:44:49,330 --> 02:44:54,190
So they were shouting people's names to go on through.

3320
02:44:54,990 --> 02:44:55,550
And...

3321
02:44:56,530 --> 02:44:57,090
And...

3322
02:44:57,730 --> 02:44:59,950
There was one person...

3323
02:44:59,950 --> 02:45:02,330
I guess their last name was Liquid.

3324
02:45:04,070 --> 02:45:07,450
And so all I hear from the customs guy was...

3325
02:45:07,450 --> 02:45:08,150
Liquid!

3326
02:45:08,430 --> 02:45:09,570
And I was like...

3327
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:16,400
Brother!

3328
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:20,540
How is your last name Liquid?

3329
02:45:25,100 --> 02:45:27,420
I was going to use this to pay for a kidney replacement.

3330
02:45:27,660 --> 02:45:28,000
No!

3331
02:45:33,480 --> 02:45:34,740
Let's be a solid guy.

3332
02:45:37,270 --> 02:45:39,340
Nah, I heard he's a real snake.

3333
02:45:45,580 --> 02:45:46,970
Probably like Dutch or something.

3334
02:45:47,190 --> 02:45:48,570
Oh, probably.

3335
02:45:50,350 --> 02:45:51,670
John Liquid.

3336
02:45:54,050 --> 02:45:55,610
Gotcha for Kyla.

3337
02:45:55,770 --> 02:45:56,010
Okay.

3338
02:45:56,790 --> 02:45:57,450
Alright.

3339
02:45:57,790 --> 02:45:58,930
Let's try ASCII.

3340
02:45:58,990 --> 02:45:59,930
Oh, no.

3341
02:46:00,450 --> 02:46:01,110
ASCII?

3342
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:11,780
Sora!

3343
02:46:16,420 --> 02:46:17,360
Da -da-da-da-da-da-da!

3344
02:46:19,590 --> 02:46:21,590
Roboco-san, rank up!

3345
02:46:28,480 --> 02:46:29,200
Roboco-san...

3346
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:30,360
Wait, that was a different outfit.

3347
02:46:31,260 --> 02:46:32,240
I got the outfit.

3348
02:46:36,300 --> 02:46:36,740
Debut!

3349
02:46:39,360 --> 02:46:40,400
ASCII and luck!

3350
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:42,600
Let's go, let's go.

3351
02:46:45,160 --> 02:46:46,900
You only got a grand from the holo.

3352
02:46:46,960 --> 02:46:47,760
Try Sana next.

3353
02:46:48,160 --> 02:46:48,820
You don't have to aim.

3354
02:46:48,920 --> 02:46:49,700
I have tried Sana.

3355
02:46:49,860 --> 02:46:50,600
I really like Sana.

3356
02:46:51,040 --> 02:46:52,140
Okay, so now...

3357
02:46:52,880 --> 02:46:53,480
Um...

3358
02:46:54,120 --> 02:46:55,040
Oh, wait.

3359
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:55,660
Kyla.

3360
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:59,020
You can also do multiples?

3361
02:46:59,860 --> 02:47:00,560
Wait, how?

3362
02:47:04,260 --> 02:47:05,680
First try, baby!

3363
02:47:09,220 --> 02:47:09,880
Let's go.

3364
02:47:10,080 --> 02:47:10,420
Nice.

3365
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:19,900
And then... someone said Korone too?

3366
02:47:20,580 --> 02:47:22,040
Oh, I see the arrows.

3367
02:47:22,560 --> 02:47:23,160
Wait...

3368
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:25,460
Oh, I see, I see.

3369
02:47:25,460 --> 02:47:26,260
Okay.

3370
02:47:26,500 --> 02:47:28,100
I like to do one at a time, though.

3371
02:47:28,840 --> 02:47:29,700
Roboco is fine.

3372
02:47:31,860 --> 02:47:32,440
Oh, Kai!

3373
02:47:35,710 --> 02:47:37,410
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

3374
02:47:38,490 --> 02:47:41,090
Do you know the just released Calorie Mate Liquid?

3375
02:47:41,190 --> 02:47:41,590
Yes!

3376
02:47:41,990 --> 02:47:43,830
I'm gonna... the, the Calorie Mate game!

3377
02:47:44,070 --> 02:47:45,110
I'm gonna play it next week.

3378
02:47:47,310 --> 02:47:48,490
Of course I am!

3379
02:47:48,830 --> 02:47:49,270
Fubuki!

3380
02:47:50,750 --> 02:47:51,670
Yay, friend!

3381
02:47:54,990 --> 02:47:55,430
Um...

3382
02:47:56,670 --> 02:47:57,110
I...

3383
02:47:57,110 --> 02:48:00,610
I don't think I have Mio... and Koro.

3384
02:48:02,130 --> 02:48:04,190
Fubuki rank up!

3385
02:48:04,210 --> 02:48:05,850
The art is so cute.

3386
02:48:07,510 --> 02:48:08,190
So cute.

3387
02:48:10,190 --> 02:48:10,870
Friend.

3388
02:48:19,130 --> 02:48:20,930
Was that three in a row?

3389
02:48:23,130 --> 02:48:23,810
Ah!

3390
02:48:23,970 --> 02:48:24,450
Mio!

3391
02:48:24,730 --> 02:48:25,410
Okay.

3392
02:48:29,310 --> 02:48:29,710
Okay.

3393
02:48:29,930 --> 02:48:30,110
Okay, okay.

3394
02:48:30,130 --> 02:48:30,590
Nice, nice.

3395
02:48:31,830 --> 02:48:32,230
Alright.

3396
02:48:32,490 --> 02:48:35,530
Koro, Koro, Koro, Koro, Koro, Koro, Koro, Koro, Koro, Koro, Koro, Koro, Koro!

3397
02:48:36,010 --> 02:48:36,410
Mio!

3398
02:48:38,950 --> 02:48:39,850
All the friends.

3399
02:48:40,530 --> 02:48:40,930
Okay.

3400
02:48:41,090 --> 02:48:41,970
Last one, I'll do.

3401
02:48:42,030 --> 02:48:42,390
Last one.

3402
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:51,860
Got my VMP for Bow!

3403
02:48:52,480 --> 02:48:53,740
See you there, nerd.

3404
02:48:53,940 --> 02:48:54,840
See you there, nerd!

3405
02:49:11,590 --> 02:49:11,910
Tears?

3406
02:49:11,930 --> 02:49:13,430
I don't have enough, I don't think.

3407
02:49:13,850 --> 02:49:14,490
I don't know.

3408
02:49:14,510 --> 02:49:16,230
I don't remember how many tears it is.

3409
02:49:19,900 --> 02:49:21,340
I don't have enough tears.

3410
02:49:21,680 --> 02:49:22,940
Oh wait, the outfit!

3411
02:49:25,290 --> 02:49:26,150
I see him!

3412
02:49:26,250 --> 02:49:26,630
I see him!

3413
02:49:26,650 --> 02:49:26,990
I see him!

3414
02:49:27,090 --> 02:49:28,370
Oh my gosh, so cute!

3415
02:49:34,850 --> 02:49:35,250
Stop!

3416
02:49:35,250 --> 02:49:36,010
So cute!

3417
02:49:36,150 --> 02:49:36,610
So cute!

3418
02:49:36,730 --> 02:49:37,010
So cute!

3419
02:49:37,050 --> 02:49:37,110
So cute!

3420
02:49:37,130 --> 02:49:37,990
Wait, wait, wait.

3421
02:49:47,670 --> 02:49:50,310
I love Kiwawa's kimono.

3422
02:49:50,310 --> 02:49:50,530
I love Kiwawa's kimono.

3423
02:49:50,530 --> 02:49:51,630
So much!

3424
02:49:51,770 --> 02:49:52,710
It's so cute!

3425
02:50:02,690 --> 02:50:03,590
I did get...

3426
02:50:03,590 --> 02:50:06,850
What was the Roboco one?

3427
02:50:06,890 --> 02:50:07,190
This one!

3428
02:50:07,750 --> 02:50:08,330
Yeah!

3429
02:50:08,950 --> 02:50:10,150
It's so cool!

3430
02:50:10,650 --> 02:50:11,090
It's so cool!

3431
02:50:11,090 --> 02:50:11,370
It looks so good!

3432
02:50:11,610 --> 02:50:12,710
In sprite form.

3433
02:50:15,370 --> 02:50:15,710
Wait.

3434
02:50:18,490 --> 02:50:19,310
Oh, oh, oh!

3435
02:50:19,370 --> 02:50:19,910
There we go.

3436
02:50:20,870 --> 02:50:21,830
Oh my gosh!

3437
02:50:26,570 --> 02:50:27,510
Natsukashi!

3438
02:50:28,430 --> 02:50:29,510
Natsukashi!

3439
02:50:30,310 --> 02:50:31,390
Hehehehe!

3440
02:50:32,690 --> 02:50:34,150
So cute!

3441
02:50:39,310 --> 02:50:40,390
Hahahaha!

3442
02:50:48,640 --> 02:50:51,380
Where is God's fauna?

3443
02:50:53,440 --> 02:50:54,940
Get on it!

3444
02:51:00,900 --> 02:51:03,000
Where is Emofauna?

3445
02:51:05,360 --> 02:51:06,440
Hehehehehe!

3446
02:51:13,890 --> 02:51:15,390
Next update!

3447
02:51:16,010 --> 02:51:17,590
Yeah, right, Kei?

3448
02:51:17,710 --> 02:51:18,250
Yeah, right, Kei?

3449
02:51:24,210 --> 02:51:25,010
Right, K?

3450
02:51:27,570 --> 02:51:28,190
Maybe.

3451
02:51:29,890 --> 02:51:30,510
Okay.

3452
02:51:32,310 --> 02:51:32,930
Okay.

3453
02:51:34,670 --> 02:51:35,710
No pressure.

3454
02:51:35,950 --> 02:51:37,590
No pressure, no pressure, right?

3455
02:51:37,690 --> 02:51:39,170
Everybody stop pressuring, K.

3456
02:51:39,690 --> 02:51:41,090
Everybody stop pressuring.

3457
02:51:41,330 --> 02:51:41,790
Okay?

3458
02:51:42,790 --> 02:51:43,650
Stop it.

3459
02:51:45,090 --> 02:51:46,110
Stop the pressure.

3460
02:51:47,050 --> 02:51:48,270
Just go to Twitter.

3461
02:51:48,410 --> 02:51:50,370
Actually, I'm on petition.org.

3462
02:51:52,250 --> 02:51:53,770
Emofana in Holocure.

3463
02:51:54,910 --> 02:51:56,010
Everybody, no pressure.

3464
02:51:56,190 --> 02:51:56,530
No pressure.

3465
02:51:57,110 --> 02:52:00,210
I'm gonna post this link, but no pressure to sign the petition.

3466
02:52:00,390 --> 02:52:00,670
Okay?

3467
02:52:02,410 --> 02:52:03,370
No pressure.

3468
02:52:03,990 --> 02:52:05,950
K, for you to listen to the...

3469
02:52:05,950 --> 02:52:06,670
petition.

3470
02:52:09,050 --> 02:52:09,570
Okay?

3471
02:52:11,210 --> 02:52:13,770
No pressure if it has...

3472
02:52:15,130 --> 02:52:15,650
um...

3473
02:52:16,110 --> 02:52:17,970
like thousands of...

3474
02:52:17,970 --> 02:52:18,370
signatures?

3475
02:52:19,050 --> 02:52:20,370
I think...

3476
02:52:20,370 --> 02:52:23,710
you might feel pressured if you see...

3477
02:52:23,710 --> 02:52:24,570
all the...

3478
02:52:24,570 --> 02:52:27,690
thousands of people begging for...

3479
02:52:27,690 --> 02:52:29,870
Emofana in the...

3480
02:52:29,870 --> 02:52:30,810
next update.

3481
02:52:31,110 --> 02:52:33,230
But no pressure, okay?

3482
02:52:34,210 --> 02:52:35,350
I'm just saying.

3483
02:52:35,810 --> 02:52:38,210
You should check out a free game...

3484
02:52:38,210 --> 02:52:38,490
on Steam.

3485
02:52:38,550 --> 02:52:39,870
It's called Only Cans...

3486
02:52:39,870 --> 02:52:41,130
of First Date.

3487
02:52:41,730 --> 02:52:43,730
It's overwhelmingly positive.

3488
02:52:43,730 --> 02:52:45,510
It's a marvel in...

3489
02:52:45,510 --> 02:52:47,550
modern day storytelling.

3490
02:52:49,130 --> 02:52:49,850
Only...

3491
02:52:49,850 --> 02:52:50,430
Cans.

3492
02:52:57,340 --> 02:52:58,340
Totally not...

3493
02:52:58,340 --> 02:52:59,160
a fake fact.

3494
02:52:59,460 --> 02:53:00,440
If you say Sundowner...

3495
02:53:00,440 --> 02:53:02,620
three times in the mirror at 3 AM...

3496
02:53:02,620 --> 02:53:03,780
Bunny Wargun...

3497
02:53:03,780 --> 02:53:06,420
will appear...

3498
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:08,460
to present his...

3499
02:53:08,460 --> 02:53:10,140
criminal cybernetic gap for you.

3500
02:53:10,280 --> 02:53:11,680
Just like the good old days.

3501
02:53:22,870 --> 02:53:24,530
Sundowner, Sundowner, Sundowner.

3502
02:53:25,290 --> 02:53:26,010
Sundowner.

3503
02:53:26,350 --> 02:53:27,670
Do you guys think that...

3504
02:53:27,670 --> 02:53:30,210
they would ever make Metal Gear Rising into...

3505
02:53:30,210 --> 02:53:30,570
a musical?

3506
02:53:30,890 --> 02:53:32,050
Just like how they did with...

3507
02:53:32,050 --> 02:53:32,570
Beetlejuice?

3508
02:53:34,250 --> 02:53:35,810
Why am I sad after cheesing...

3509
02:53:36,330 --> 02:53:36,770
Cyberwolves?

3510
02:53:36,910 --> 02:53:41,190
Oh my gosh!

3511
02:53:41,290 --> 02:53:42,230
Look, our screen is really...

3512
02:53:42,230 --> 02:53:42,790
filled up now.

3513
02:53:42,970 --> 02:53:43,470
It's so awesome.

3514
02:53:43,890 --> 02:53:46,230
I will get... Actually, I want to just...

3515
02:53:46,230 --> 02:53:46,850
try for everyone.

3516
02:53:48,810 --> 02:53:50,270
I would really want to get everybody.

3517
02:53:50,590 --> 02:53:52,250
I want my screen to be full and...

3518
02:53:52,250 --> 02:53:52,530
exciting.

3519
02:53:55,250 --> 02:53:56,190
Kids are cruel...

3520
02:53:56,350 --> 02:53:56,510
Jack.

3521
02:53:56,510 --> 02:53:58,330
Kids are Cruel Jack would go hard...

3522
02:53:58,330 --> 02:53:58,790
as a song.

3523
02:53:59,390 --> 02:54:02,170
Kids are Cruel Jack and don't come back...

3524
02:54:02,170 --> 02:54:02,710
no more.

3525
02:54:05,050 --> 02:54:06,850
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

3526
02:54:07,090 --> 02:54:14,230
We need Crony.

3527
02:54:14,770 --> 02:54:15,930
Hold on, I'm just gonna...

3528
02:54:15,930 --> 02:54:17,630
Oh wait, I already paid for it.

3529
02:54:18,310 --> 02:54:19,410
We need Crony.

3530
02:54:21,730 --> 02:54:23,670
Actually, ranking up Mumei...

3531
02:54:23,670 --> 02:54:24,750
is pretty good.

3532
02:54:24,870 --> 02:54:25,550
Not gonna lie.

3533
02:54:26,390 --> 02:54:27,530
I'm gonna do...

3534
02:54:29,290 --> 02:54:29,730
3.

3535
02:54:30,370 --> 02:54:30,810
No!

3536
02:54:30,990 --> 02:54:31,830
Oh, nevermind.

3537
02:54:32,530 --> 02:54:34,810
Well, if you include the one I just did, that's 4.

3538
02:54:34,850 --> 02:54:35,470
Spooky number.

3539
02:54:35,870 --> 02:54:37,750
Oh my gosh!

3540
02:54:40,250 --> 02:54:41,030
I'll forget!

3541
02:54:48,770 --> 02:54:50,470
Um, kind of the perfect pull.

3542
02:54:50,590 --> 02:54:51,010
Ever?

3543
02:54:53,690 --> 02:54:56,290
So now I think I... Oh, wait, do I have Bails?

3544
02:54:57,130 --> 02:54:57,870
Am I crazy?

3545
02:54:57,870 --> 02:54:59,770
I think I pulled her last...

3546
02:54:59,770 --> 02:55:00,190
Yeah, okay.

3547
02:55:00,430 --> 02:55:01,530
So we have...

3548
02:55:01,530 --> 02:55:03,170
all of...

3549
02:55:04,370 --> 02:55:05,410
Council promise.

3550
02:55:08,590 --> 02:55:09,810
Next we need Coro.

3551
02:55:14,320 --> 02:55:14,840
Coro!

3552
02:55:14,840 --> 02:55:15,540
Come home!

3553
02:55:34,270 --> 02:55:36,590
How many times have I pulled Mio at this point?

3554
02:55:36,950 --> 02:55:38,150
Mio likes you.

3555
02:55:38,430 --> 02:55:39,170
I know.

3556
02:55:41,010 --> 02:55:42,650
I have one more pull...

3557
02:55:42,650 --> 02:55:44,010
to be able to buy...

3558
02:55:44,810 --> 02:55:45,490
Corone with the tears.

3559
02:55:51,210 --> 02:55:51,610
Okay...

3560
02:55:52,910 --> 02:55:53,310
Um...

3561
02:56:11,890 --> 02:56:12,950
Oh my gosh...

3562
02:56:12,950 --> 02:56:14,770
Your screen is so full...

3563
02:56:19,180 --> 02:56:19,580
Okay...

3564
02:56:19,580 --> 02:56:21,260
I'm gonna do something insane.

3565
02:56:24,760 --> 02:56:25,800
I'm gonna do something...

3566
02:56:25,800 --> 02:56:26,820
absolutely insane.

3567
02:56:27,860 --> 02:56:28,940
You guys ready for this?

3568
02:56:29,480 --> 02:56:30,640
Are you guys ready for this?

3569
02:56:30,720 --> 02:56:31,520
Are you guys ready for this?

3570
02:56:35,640 --> 02:56:36,660
One, two, three...

3571
02:56:57,990 --> 02:56:58,350
Oh...

3572
02:57:00,250 --> 02:57:01,450
Advent isn't in this, are they?

3573
02:57:01,510 --> 02:57:02,390
No, no, not yet.

3574
02:57:02,890 --> 02:57:03,850
They are not in.

3575
02:57:05,890 --> 02:57:07,590
All blinds... but Aki.

3576
02:57:10,570 --> 02:57:12,830
Okay you guys, I'm gonna do something absolutely insane.

3577
02:57:13,150 --> 02:57:14,370
Okay, are you guys ready for this?

3578
02:57:15,590 --> 02:57:16,650
Are you guys ready for this?

3579
02:57:16,670 --> 02:57:17,410
Are you guys ready for this?

3580
02:57:17,410 --> 02:57:19,590
Are you guys ready for this?

3581
02:57:23,270 --> 02:57:23,630
Insane.

3582
02:57:24,210 --> 02:57:24,570
Ready?

3583
02:57:40,660 --> 02:57:42,140
All for Mio.

3584
02:57:48,440 --> 02:57:51,560
Wait, does Matsuri show up on the front?

3585
02:57:51,940 --> 02:57:55,220
Oh, even though we didn't get the original outfit, we're all good.

3586
02:57:56,680 --> 02:58:00,900
You think I made the market for Ganyu?

3587
02:58:03,400 --> 02:58:05,460
It works, it works, it works, it works.

3588
02:58:10,080 --> 02:58:11,460
Who do I want to play?

3589
02:58:11,500 --> 02:58:11,760
Oh, wait.

3590
02:58:12,140 --> 02:58:12,740
Okay, guys.

3591
02:58:13,460 --> 02:58:16,360
Before I end stream, I want to do one more game.

3592
02:58:17,720 --> 02:58:19,380
I want to do the Haunted House.

3593
02:58:20,420 --> 02:58:22,120
We'll do more gacha next time.

3594
02:58:22,440 --> 02:58:25,380
I won't do any more gacha, I promise, I promise, I promise, I promise.

3595
02:58:25,460 --> 02:58:28,400
I'll just play and make more money so we can do lots of gacha next time, okay?

3596
02:58:31,560 --> 02:58:33,620
But who should I use for the Haunted House?

3597
02:58:37,660 --> 02:58:38,460
Gido Kronil.

3598
02:58:40,400 --> 02:58:40,800
Kaila?

3599
02:58:40,940 --> 02:58:41,340
Okay.

3600
02:58:42,020 --> 02:58:42,660
Wait, hold on.

3601
02:58:42,760 --> 02:58:45,080
Also, I have a little bit of money.

3602
02:58:45,180 --> 02:58:46,580
I can maybe buy some upgrades.

3603
02:58:58,000 --> 02:58:59,340
Oh, it's 10,000.

3604
02:58:59,400 --> 02:58:59,700
My bad.

3605
02:58:59,860 --> 02:59:00,760
I thought it was 1,000.

3606
02:59:09,190 --> 02:59:10,690
What do I want to upgrade, though?

3607
02:59:12,790 --> 02:59:13,190
Gold?

3608
02:59:13,750 --> 02:59:14,650
The money gain?

3609
02:59:17,610 --> 02:59:18,370
XP gain?

3610
02:59:19,190 --> 02:59:20,130
Where is the XP?

3611
02:59:20,370 --> 02:59:21,810
Oh, it does pick up XP.

3612
02:59:22,370 --> 02:59:23,150
Is this one?

3613
02:59:26,210 --> 02:59:26,650
Speed?

3614
02:59:36,870 --> 02:59:40,430
I might actually do the attack and...

3615
02:59:49,470 --> 02:59:50,390
I think that's it.

3616
02:59:50,930 --> 02:59:51,790
I think that's it.

3617
02:59:52,970 --> 02:59:53,970
We'll see how we do here.

3618
02:59:54,430 --> 02:59:55,230
Where is she?

3619
02:59:56,350 --> 02:59:57,270
There she is.

3620
03:00:00,110 --> 03:00:00,670
Wait.

3621
03:00:01,050 --> 03:00:04,830
Spawn the rarest material deposit that deals 300% damage to all targets when hit.

3622
03:00:04,950 --> 03:00:08,650
When fully mined, Kaila gains happiness, granting 50% attack speed.

3623
03:00:08,850 --> 03:00:09,930
Haste for 10 seconds.

3624
03:00:10,410 --> 03:00:12,110
Alright, swing the hammer in front.

3625
03:00:14,070 --> 03:00:14,630
Okay.

3626
03:00:15,650 --> 03:00:17,830
Let's try the Halloween Castle!

3627
03:00:18,270 --> 03:00:19,190
I'm so excited.

3628
03:00:24,420 --> 03:00:26,740
I'm not expecting to beat this.

3629
03:00:28,360 --> 03:00:28,920
I'm just...

3630
03:00:31,340 --> 03:00:31,900
I'm just...

3631
03:00:31,900 --> 03:00:32,380
here.

3632
03:00:32,500 --> 03:00:33,080
Oh, my gosh.

3633
03:00:33,300 --> 03:00:34,460
The range on it.

3634
03:00:34,580 --> 03:00:37,620
OK Oh, my gosh, the range!

3635
03:00:38,100 --> 03:00:38,500
Oh, my– OK.

3636
03:00:39,140 --> 03:00:39,420
OK.

3637
03:00:39,420 --> 03:00:40,060
I get it.

3638
03:00:40,100 --> 03:00:40,460
I get it.

3639
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:40,800
I get it.

3640
03:00:40,920 --> 03:00:41,360
Yeah, yeah.

3641
03:00:41,440 --> 03:00:42,200
I'll get it.

3642
03:00:42,240 --> 03:00:42,640
I get it.

3643
03:00:42,760 --> 03:00:43,960
I get it, I get it, I get it.

3644
03:00:43,980 --> 03:00:45,220
I get it, I get it, I get it.

3645
03:00:51,820 --> 03:00:52,880
Maybe the black...

3646
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:54,400
... connection.

3647
03:01:02,710 --> 03:01:03,270
No pressure.

3648
03:01:11,870 --> 03:01:13,490
I want to do it for the funny.

3649
03:01:14,370 --> 03:01:15,590
I want to do it for the funny.

3650
03:01:15,650 --> 03:01:16,070
No pressure!

3651
03:01:16,290 --> 03:01:16,850
No pressure!

3652
03:01:16,990 --> 03:01:17,250
Okay!

3653
03:01:17,350 --> 03:01:17,890
No pressure!

3654
03:01:18,550 --> 03:01:19,470
Okay, okay, okay.

3655
03:01:22,650 --> 03:01:23,570
Hammer level 2.

3656
03:01:31,530 --> 03:01:36,310
Targets have a 2% chance to drop an ore deposit, which may be destroyed with Hammer Swing to drop ore.

3657
03:01:37,310 --> 03:01:39,850
Gaining 10 type of an ore will strengthen.

3658
03:01:40,550 --> 03:01:41,090
Strengthen what?

3659
03:01:43,130 --> 03:01:45,170
All weapons by 1, 2, or 3%.

3660
03:01:46,510 --> 03:01:49,070
You guys keep telling me to get credit card, but like what's...

3661
03:01:51,650 --> 03:01:52,650
Is it because...

3662
03:01:53,290 --> 03:01:56,010
Are anvils something special because she's a blacksmith?

3663
03:02:09,260 --> 03:02:10,340
Kyla spawns anvils.

3664
03:02:11,920 --> 03:02:12,720
I see.

3665
03:02:13,780 --> 03:02:14,740
Okay, I'll try it.

3666
03:02:14,800 --> 03:02:15,180
I'll try it.

3667
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:16,820
I'll try it.

3668
03:02:16,840 --> 03:02:17,240
I'll try it.

3669
03:02:18,220 --> 03:02:19,000
You know me.

3670
03:02:19,900 --> 03:02:20,700
If I...

3671
03:02:20,700 --> 03:02:22,480
Since I have like so...

3672
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:23,780
Little experience.

3673
03:02:24,960 --> 03:02:28,200
I want to try many different types of plays.

3674
03:02:29,960 --> 03:02:31,700
Okay, I'm going to get the blacksmith though.

3675
03:02:32,040 --> 03:02:33,240
I want to see it.

3676
03:02:34,040 --> 03:02:35,560
I'm going to destroy the statue.

3677
03:02:36,180 --> 03:02:36,320
Yeah.

3678
03:02:36,480 --> 03:02:37,120
Yeah.

3679
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:38,160
Yeah.

3680
03:02:38,740 --> 03:02:39,140
Yeah.

3681
03:02:40,380 --> 03:02:41,800
What did this happen?

3682
03:02:42,260 --> 03:02:42,900
Shoot.

3683
03:02:45,280 --> 03:02:46,280
Okay, we're fine.

3684
03:02:46,580 --> 03:02:47,380
Everything's good.

3685
03:02:48,520 --> 03:02:49,160
Yeah.

3686
03:02:49,480 --> 03:02:50,120
Yeah.

3687
03:02:50,340 --> 03:02:50,780
Yeah.

3688
03:02:50,780 --> 03:02:51,360
Yeah.

3689
03:02:56,840 --> 03:02:57,320
I think I'm going to beat this level.

3690
03:02:57,340 --> 03:02:57,820
Wowee.

3691
03:02:59,800 --> 03:03:01,300
Took a little bit of damage there.

3692
03:03:01,360 --> 03:03:02,000
It's okay though.

3693
03:03:02,580 --> 03:03:05,340
Oh my god, it took some more damage there.

3694
03:03:05,400 --> 03:03:05,880
That's okay.

3695
03:03:07,040 --> 03:03:07,520
Maybe.

3696
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:13,540
I'm not expecting to beat this level.

3697
03:03:15,380 --> 03:03:16,820
I'm going to try it out.

3698
03:03:16,960 --> 03:03:18,080
It's so cute in here though.

3699
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:21,320
I feel so homey.

3700
03:03:23,800 --> 03:03:25,200
So many piggies.

3701
03:03:25,820 --> 03:03:28,660
What are Hachama's fans called?

3702
03:03:33,870 --> 03:03:35,030
I knew that.

3703
03:03:35,070 --> 03:03:35,910
I knew the Hattons.

3704
03:03:36,130 --> 03:03:36,710
I'm stupid.

3705
03:03:38,130 --> 03:03:39,190
I actually knew that one.

3706
03:04:00,500 --> 03:04:01,320
Oh my gosh.

3707
03:04:01,520 --> 03:04:02,880
Don't blow up on me, please.

3708
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:12,140
Come back and circle around for the XP around here.

3709
03:04:16,820 --> 03:04:19,700
Fubuki's are Sukonbu and Matsuri's are Matsurisu.

3710
03:04:19,800 --> 03:04:21,380
Oh, I didn't know the Matsurisu too.

3711
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:27,660
Kyla is good for using the ult as many times as possible.

3712
03:04:27,840 --> 03:04:28,180
Oh, okay.

3713
03:04:28,580 --> 03:04:29,420
Let me try it.

3714
03:04:29,580 --> 03:04:30,340
Oh, what is this?

3715
03:04:36,100 --> 03:04:36,860
What's going on?

3716
03:04:36,860 --> 03:04:37,260
What's happening?

3717
03:04:38,120 --> 03:04:39,380
I don't know what's going on.

3718
03:04:43,740 --> 03:04:44,580
One or four.

3719
03:04:44,680 --> 03:04:46,560
Sorry, I'm going faster than you guys are typing.

3720
03:04:48,380 --> 03:04:50,600
Sorry, I'm going faster than you guys are typing.

3721
03:04:52,420 --> 03:04:52,880
Awakened!

3722
03:04:52,880 --> 03:04:53,860
We got the awakened though.

3723
03:04:55,020 --> 03:04:55,480
Oh,

3724
03:05:08,480 --> 03:05:09,100
whammy water.

3725
03:05:09,640 --> 03:05:10,340
I'll take it.

3726
03:05:12,240 --> 03:05:13,840
Oh, she's fast now.

3727
03:05:14,540 --> 03:05:15,800
She's fast fast.

3728
03:05:19,280 --> 03:05:21,080
The range is kind of crazy.

3729
03:05:21,180 --> 03:05:21,960
On this thing.

3730
03:05:27,150 --> 03:05:28,030
Oh.

3731
03:05:28,030 --> 03:05:29,050
Blacksmith 2.

3732
03:05:34,360 --> 03:05:35,440
I'm cornering myself.

3733
03:05:35,800 --> 03:05:39,020
Oh my god!

3734
03:05:39,300 --> 03:05:41,180
How do we avoid all of it?

3735
03:05:43,440 --> 03:05:44,320
Okay.

3736
03:05:49,810 --> 03:05:50,250
Alright.

3737
03:05:51,730 --> 03:05:52,510
No pressure.

3738
03:05:53,050 --> 03:05:55,170
No pressure.

3739
03:05:55,790 --> 03:05:56,670
What the?

3740
03:05:57,990 --> 03:05:59,470
What the hell is that?

3741
03:06:01,070 --> 03:06:01,650
Oh!

3742
03:06:02,370 --> 03:06:02,950
Attack!

3743
03:06:04,010 --> 03:06:04,850
Oh gosh!

3744
03:06:08,730 --> 03:06:09,910
He's healing them!

3745
03:06:14,010 --> 03:06:14,810
Heals enemies.

3746
03:06:15,690 --> 03:06:16,850
Not on my watch.

3747
03:06:19,490 --> 03:06:21,490
100% damage to all targets within...

3748
03:06:21,490 --> 03:06:22,290
Wow!

3749
03:06:22,510 --> 03:06:23,310
Okay, let's do that one.

3750
03:06:24,930 --> 03:06:26,150
Not on my watch!

3751
03:06:26,290 --> 03:06:26,650
Not on my watch!

3752
03:06:26,650 --> 03:06:27,130
Die!

3753
03:06:27,290 --> 03:06:27,690
Die!

3754
03:06:27,790 --> 03:06:28,050
Die!

3755
03:06:32,400 --> 03:06:33,240
Did I kill him?

3756
03:06:34,380 --> 03:06:35,480
I think I got him.

3757
03:06:35,540 --> 03:06:36,840
His little ring is gone.

3758
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:38,740
You got this man.

3759
03:06:38,860 --> 03:06:39,600
Thank you!

3760
03:06:40,080 --> 03:06:40,940
Hold on.

3761
03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:41,800
I can't read the rest of it.

3762
03:06:41,900 --> 03:06:42,620
But thank you!

3763
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:44,980
I saw something about...

3764
03:06:44,980 --> 03:06:45,160
Oh.

3765
03:06:54,230 --> 03:06:56,270
Does the credit card work with the...

3766
03:06:56,270 --> 03:06:57,170
With blacksmith?

3767
03:06:57,350 --> 03:06:59,890
Like, is that technically summoning anvils too?

3768
03:07:00,050 --> 03:07:01,770
Since, I mean, it's summoning anvils.

3769
03:07:02,610 --> 03:07:03,470
Does that count?

3770
03:07:05,050 --> 03:07:06,130
Look at the popcorn!

3771
03:07:06,490 --> 03:07:07,230
Oh my gosh.

3772
03:07:07,230 --> 03:07:07,430
It's like...

3773
03:07:07,430 --> 03:07:07,510
Oh my gosh.

3774
03:07:07,510 --> 03:07:08,550
It's so cute out here.

3775
03:07:08,690 --> 03:07:08,830
Oh.

3776
03:07:10,110 --> 03:07:10,890
That's so...

3777
03:07:10,890 --> 03:07:11,550
Oh, it does!

3778
03:07:12,050 --> 03:07:12,790
Okay, cool.

3779
03:07:13,590 --> 03:07:14,430
That's exciting.

3780
03:07:14,690 --> 03:07:15,110
That's fun.

3781
03:07:18,130 --> 03:07:18,570
Whoa!

3782
03:07:19,330 --> 03:07:19,770
Whoa!

3783
03:07:21,310 --> 03:07:22,330
Oh my gosh!

3784
03:07:22,350 --> 03:07:22,790
So cute!

3785
03:07:23,530 --> 03:07:23,730
Oh.

3786
03:07:23,810 --> 03:07:24,370
Ouchy ouch.

3787
03:07:24,710 --> 03:07:25,970
I don't know who I ran into.

3788
03:07:26,130 --> 03:07:27,070
But I ran into somebody.

3789
03:07:30,350 --> 03:07:30,790
Ult!

3790
03:07:33,090 --> 03:07:33,770
Oh, thank you.

3791
03:07:33,870 --> 03:07:34,410
Sorry, guys.

3792
03:07:34,470 --> 03:07:35,490
I keep forgetting...

3793
03:07:35,490 --> 03:07:36,230
Okay.

3794
03:07:36,370 --> 03:07:37,410
You know how I was playing.

3795
03:07:37,410 --> 03:07:41,410
I was playing before where I'm like, I only ult when I need to, so...

3796
03:07:44,430 --> 03:07:46,590
Let's go for the...

3797
03:07:47,790 --> 03:07:48,530
Credit card.

3798
03:08:02,600 --> 03:08:02,980
Ult.

3799
03:08:03,080 --> 03:08:03,780
Wait, two more...

3800
03:08:03,780 --> 03:08:04,020
Ult.

3801
03:08:04,300 --> 03:08:04,640
Ult.

3802
03:08:04,720 --> 03:08:05,060
Uh-oh.

3803
03:08:05,060 --> 03:08:06,040
I'm in a corner.

3804
03:08:09,300 --> 03:08:11,320
It takes time to get used to everyone's ults.

3805
03:08:11,500 --> 03:08:13,560
Thank you, Yuni, for being so understanding.

3806
03:08:16,260 --> 03:08:17,580
Normally, anvils can be used to ice.

3807
03:08:17,700 --> 03:08:17,880
Oh.

3808
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:19,680
That's my...

3809
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:20,300
That's my...

3810
03:08:20,300 --> 03:08:20,800
That's my stuff.

3811
03:08:24,420 --> 03:08:25,400
Ta-da-da!

3812
03:08:26,940 --> 03:08:27,420
Whoa!

3813
03:08:27,720 --> 03:08:28,200
Whoa!

3814
03:08:28,200 --> 03:08:28,420
We...

3815
03:08:28,420 --> 03:08:28,600
Wow!

3816
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:29,060
Oh, guys.

3817
03:08:29,240 --> 03:08:29,640
Guys.

3818
03:08:29,640 --> 03:08:29,960
Guys.

3819
03:08:29,980 --> 03:08:30,180
Guys.

3820
03:08:30,180 --> 03:08:31,960
The anvil will wait.

3821
03:08:33,660 --> 03:08:35,180
We will come back for the anvil.

3822
03:08:35,280 --> 03:08:37,460
And I see that there's an item as well.

3823
03:08:37,520 --> 03:08:38,420
Do not fret.

3824
03:08:39,440 --> 03:08:40,500
Do not fret.

3825
03:08:40,620 --> 03:08:41,820
I see...

3826
03:08:42,300 --> 03:08:43,040
Peckle, peckle.

3827
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:47,860
Oh my gosh.

3828
03:08:49,560 --> 03:08:50,960
We're getting a...

3829
03:08:51,620 --> 03:08:52,580
A little...

3830
03:08:52,580 --> 03:08:53,680
Oh my gosh.

3831
03:08:53,800 --> 03:08:57,020
I need to make sure it's still safe before I use it.

3832
03:08:58,560 --> 03:08:59,040
Um...

3833
03:08:59,040 --> 03:08:59,860
We might die.

3834
03:09:00,380 --> 03:09:01,880
And if I did...

3835
03:09:03,020 --> 03:09:03,500
Um...

3836
03:09:03,500 --> 03:09:04,140
It was a run.

3837
03:09:06,380 --> 03:09:07,860
If I die...

3838
03:09:09,140 --> 03:09:10,000
It was a run.

3839
03:09:13,790 --> 03:09:15,350
Asakoko plus damage is a good pick.

3840
03:09:17,410 --> 03:09:17,890
Yeah.

3841
03:09:18,210 --> 03:09:18,690
Yeah.

3842
03:09:19,030 --> 03:09:19,510
Yeah.

3843
03:09:20,590 --> 03:09:22,470
It was a run of all time.

3844
03:09:23,630 --> 03:09:27,490
I think if I could get some extra damage to help me out of here, it might be good.

3845
03:09:32,090 --> 03:09:32,810
Just for...

3846
03:09:32,810 --> 03:09:33,730
Just to help me...

3847
03:09:33,730 --> 03:09:34,710
Help me get out of here.

3848
03:09:34,790 --> 03:09:35,190
You know what I mean?

3849
03:09:36,470 --> 03:09:37,230
Help me...

3850
03:09:37,230 --> 03:09:37,810
Uh...

3851
03:09:37,810 --> 03:09:38,850
Not die.

3852
03:09:39,050 --> 03:09:39,810
Oh my god!

3853
03:09:40,290 --> 03:09:41,050
Oh my god!

3854
03:09:41,430 --> 03:09:41,830
What?

3855
03:09:42,610 --> 03:09:44,150
I got stuck on the wall!

3856
03:09:46,130 --> 03:09:46,530
No!

3857
03:09:46,990 --> 03:09:47,570
I got...

3858
03:09:47,570 --> 03:09:48,390
I got stuck on the wall.

3859
03:09:50,930 --> 03:09:51,490
Don't die.

3860
03:09:51,490 --> 03:09:51,630
Don't die.

3861
03:09:51,630 --> 03:09:51,850
Don't die.

3862
03:09:51,890 --> 03:09:52,230
Ikusyo.

3863
03:09:54,530 --> 03:09:55,350
That's okay though.

3864
03:09:55,670 --> 03:09:57,150
I just wanted to try it out.

3865
03:09:58,190 --> 03:09:59,450
I wanted to try it out.

3866
03:10:08,160 --> 03:10:08,600
Enty.

3867
03:10:08,620 --> 03:10:09,240
Thank you!

3868
03:10:11,540 --> 03:10:11,980
Um...

3869
03:10:12,920 --> 03:10:13,760
I keep...

3870
03:10:13,760 --> 03:10:16,960
I am learning more and more of this game each time I try.

3871
03:10:19,660 --> 03:10:20,100
Um...

3872
03:10:21,320 --> 03:10:22,200
I like...

3873
03:10:23,080 --> 03:10:23,520
I...

3874
03:10:23,520 --> 03:10:24,340
I've played Sana.

3875
03:10:24,520 --> 03:10:25,260
I really like Sana.

3876
03:10:25,400 --> 03:10:25,660
I like...

3877
03:10:25,680 --> 03:10:26,700
Mumei.

3878
03:10:29,060 --> 03:10:29,700
Um...

3879
03:10:31,820 --> 03:10:35,300
I think I will like Kaila if I try her more.

3880
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:40,340
Risu obviously good for the cash money money skill issue.

3881
03:10:59,390 --> 03:11:00,510
But um...

3882
03:11:00,510 --> 03:11:01,490
Yeah!

3883
03:11:01,830 --> 03:11:02,730
So fun!

3884
03:11:03,050 --> 03:11:03,830
Cronies fun.

3885
03:11:04,070 --> 03:11:04,290
There...

3886
03:11:04,290 --> 03:11:04,650
I mean...

3887
03:11:04,650 --> 03:11:07,430
I have played like...

3888
03:11:07,430 --> 03:11:08,170
Oh!

3889
03:11:08,270 --> 03:11:08,410
I...

3890
03:11:08,410 --> 03:11:09,030
I like playing Cronies.

3891
03:11:09,050 --> 03:11:09,590
I like playing Fauna too.

3892
03:11:10,290 --> 03:11:13,350
I've played literally like five people.

3893
03:11:13,610 --> 03:11:14,110
So...

3894
03:11:15,570 --> 03:11:17,170
I've played like five people.

3895
03:11:17,330 --> 03:11:17,710
So...

3896
03:11:17,710 --> 03:11:18,790
There are many more.

3897
03:11:19,030 --> 03:11:21,850
I still can't say that I have a definitive main yet.

3898
03:11:22,010 --> 03:11:22,510
But...

3899
03:11:23,390 --> 03:11:24,310
I am...

3900
03:11:25,130 --> 03:11:26,130
Every time...

3901
03:11:26,130 --> 03:11:28,050
Getting more and more used to...

3902
03:11:29,730 --> 03:11:30,230
Uh...

3903
03:11:30,890 --> 03:11:31,890
To playing.

3904
03:11:32,350 --> 03:11:33,230
Thanks for the stream!

3905
03:11:33,410 --> 03:11:35,950
I hope you can stream it again when the new update hits.

3906
03:11:36,050 --> 03:11:38,510
It's going to have JP Gen 3 and 4 sent to allow!

3907
03:11:39,050 --> 03:11:39,290
Yes!

3908
03:11:41,590 --> 03:11:42,190
Dala.

3909
03:11:43,830 --> 03:11:44,430
Dala.

3910
03:11:47,330 --> 03:11:47,930
Dala.

3911
03:11:48,610 --> 03:11:50,450
All characters are fun in their own way.

3912
03:11:50,610 --> 03:11:50,830
No!

3913
03:11:50,970 --> 03:11:51,490
I mean...

3914
03:11:51,490 --> 03:11:53,250
Clearly so much...

3915
03:11:53,250 --> 03:11:54,810
Has gone into...

3916
03:11:54,810 --> 03:11:57,550
Thinking about abilities for each...

3917
03:11:57,550 --> 03:11:58,690
Each member.

3918
03:11:58,830 --> 03:11:59,550
It's kind of insane.

3919
03:12:02,190 --> 03:12:02,790
Um...

3920
03:12:02,790 --> 03:12:03,970
Dev team is cracked.

3921
03:12:04,270 --> 03:12:04,630
Truly.

3922
03:12:06,550 --> 03:12:07,150
Um...

3923
03:12:07,150 --> 03:12:07,430
But yeah!

3924
03:12:07,630 --> 03:12:08,570
Thank you guys!

3925
03:12:08,590 --> 03:12:09,030
For watching!

3926
03:12:09,050 --> 03:12:10,730
Thanks for hanging out with me!

3927
03:12:12,290 --> 03:12:12,770
And...

3928
03:12:12,770 --> 03:12:13,270
Um...

3929
03:12:13,270 --> 03:12:14,010
Probably...

3930
03:12:14,010 --> 03:12:15,150
We'll play...

3931
03:12:15,150 --> 03:12:15,930
Uh...

3932
03:12:15,930 --> 03:12:16,490
Again...

3933
03:12:16,490 --> 03:12:17,510
Whenever the next...

3934
03:12:17,510 --> 03:12:17,790
When...

3935
03:12:17,790 --> 03:12:18,970
Is the update?

3936
03:12:19,130 --> 03:12:19,590
Have they said?

3937
03:12:22,010 --> 03:12:22,830
Have they said?

3938
03:12:22,830 --> 03:12:23,230
Have they said?

3939
03:12:29,670 --> 03:12:30,150
October!

3940
03:12:30,550 --> 03:12:31,190
Next month!

3941
03:12:31,310 --> 03:12:31,570
Maybe!

3942
03:12:31,750 --> 03:12:31,990
Okay!

3943
03:12:33,210 --> 03:12:35,350
So then I'll probably play again next month!

3944
03:12:35,390 --> 03:12:35,710
Maybe!

3945
03:12:38,430 --> 03:12:39,510
That's my Oshii too.

3946
03:12:39,590 --> 03:12:41,130
She will be eternal in all our hearts.

3947
03:12:41,650 --> 03:12:42,130
Yeah!

3948
03:12:45,810 --> 03:12:46,370
Eternal!

3949
03:12:48,090 --> 03:12:48,650
Um...

3950
03:12:49,630 --> 03:12:50,190
Mmm!

3951
03:12:51,910 --> 03:12:52,470
October!

3952
03:12:52,930 --> 03:12:53,490
Cool!

3953
03:12:53,950 --> 03:12:55,050
Then we'll see...

3954
03:12:55,050 --> 03:12:55,630
We'll see...

3955
03:12:55,630 --> 03:12:57,030
Holocure again in October!

3956
03:12:57,450 --> 03:12:58,010
But I...

3957
03:12:58,010 --> 03:12:59,310
I will still play on...

3958
03:12:59,310 --> 03:13:00,290
On...

3959
03:13:00,290 --> 03:13:00,670
On...

3960
03:13:00,670 --> 03:13:01,350
On my own.

3961
03:13:01,490 --> 03:13:01,950
Just...

3962
03:13:01,950 --> 03:13:02,730
I won't do gacha!

3963
03:13:02,950 --> 03:13:04,050
I won't do gacha!

3964
03:13:06,610 --> 03:13:07,530
I'll just play.

3965
03:13:07,730 --> 03:13:09,130
And get lots of money!

3966
03:13:09,290 --> 03:13:09,570
Money!

3967
03:13:09,770 --> 03:13:09,910
Money!

3968
03:13:10,190 --> 03:13:10,670
Hahaha!

3969
03:13:10,970 --> 03:13:12,610
And upgrades and stuff too.

3970
03:13:12,670 --> 03:13:13,070
Probably.

3971
03:13:13,230 --> 03:13:13,670
But yeah!

3972
03:13:13,670 --> 03:13:14,490
Aki Daki!

3973
03:13:14,630 --> 03:13:15,690
Tomorrow I have karaoke!

3974
03:13:16,050 --> 03:13:17,430
Where I'm gonna be singing...

3975
03:13:17,430 --> 03:13:18,670
Any song...

3976
03:13:19,630 --> 03:13:20,130
Um...

3977
03:13:20,790 --> 03:13:21,290
Whatever...

3978
03:13:21,290 --> 03:13:23,210
Anime songs I'm gonna sing, baby!

3979
03:13:24,330 --> 03:13:24,830
Yeah!

3980
03:13:24,850 --> 03:13:25,070
Yeah!

3981
03:13:25,710 --> 03:13:26,210
And...

3982
03:13:26,210 --> 03:13:26,670
Yeah!

3983
03:13:26,770 --> 03:13:27,390
I'm excited!

3984
03:13:27,730 --> 03:13:29,710
I will see you guys tomorrow if I see you!

3985
03:13:29,770 --> 03:13:30,850
And if not, I'll sue!

3986
03:13:32,170 --> 03:13:32,670
Um...

3987
03:13:33,790 --> 03:13:34,290
Whatever!

3988
03:13:34,850 --> 03:13:35,930
Have a good day!

3989
03:13:35,970 --> 03:13:37,130
Have a good night!

3990
03:13:38,030 --> 03:13:38,530
And...

3991
03:13:38,530 --> 03:13:39,450
Um...

3992
03:13:39,450 --> 03:13:40,970
Thanks again for hanging out with me!

3993
03:13:42,110 --> 03:13:42,610
And...

3994
03:13:42,610 --> 03:13:43,270
What was I gonna say?

3995
03:13:43,370 --> 03:13:43,650
Um...

3996
03:13:45,350 --> 03:13:49,050
I think next time I play, for sure, I wanna go like really long, you know?

3997
03:13:49,150 --> 03:13:50,990
I wanna try the endless mode for sure.

3998
03:13:51,750 --> 03:13:52,550
Especially like...

3999
03:13:53,770 --> 03:13:57,110
I'll do it on my own and see how far I can get and things like that.

4000
03:13:57,910 --> 03:13:58,310
But...

4001
03:13:59,030 --> 03:14:01,750
You know, I feel like with that Mumei build we had...

4002
03:14:01,750 --> 03:14:04,310
I feel like we could've done endless mode...

4003
03:14:04,310 --> 03:14:04,690
I don't know.

4004
03:14:05,230 --> 03:14:05,950
I feel...

4005
03:14:05,950 --> 03:14:07,030
I felt like we could've...

4006
03:14:07,670 --> 03:14:08,470
Gone crazy.

4007
03:14:08,710 --> 03:14:09,390
You know what I mean?

4008
03:14:12,490 --> 03:14:13,830
I feel like we could've gone...

4009
03:14:14,670 --> 03:14:15,370
Pretty far.

4010
03:14:18,330 --> 03:14:18,930
Oh yeah!

4011
03:14:27,280 --> 03:14:28,960

4012
03:14:28,960 --> 03:14:29,500

4030
03:14:45,380 --> 03:14:46,840
Don't forget that!

4031
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:47,740
Bye!

4032

Don't forget that!
