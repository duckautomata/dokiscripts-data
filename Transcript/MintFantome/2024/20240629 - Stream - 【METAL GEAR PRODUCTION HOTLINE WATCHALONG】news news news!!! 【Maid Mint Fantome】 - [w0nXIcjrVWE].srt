1
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,870
Excuse me, master and lady!

2
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,310
Moka moka!

3
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,850
Moka moka moka moka moka moka moka moka!

4
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,530
The shirt!

5
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,810
Oh yeah, you noticed.

6
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,610
Oh, it's kind of wobbly.

7
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,870
That's better.

8
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,670
Love your shirt!

9
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,230
You guys, I ordered it from like...

10
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,150
So you know when you order something from like Amazon?

11
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,390
And then it comes...

12
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,990
And it's like...

13
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,690
Like a baby, you know?

14
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,190
You think you're ordering something, but then they just put it on a t-shirt?

15
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,950
I thought I was ordering a t-shirt and then...

16
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,670
I thought...

17
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,290
Instead, it was not a PNG shirt.

18
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,110
It was a JPEG shirt!

19
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,950
I kind of got scammed.

20
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,110
I ordered a PNG t-shirt, but instead...

21
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,970
A JPEG t-shirt came.

22
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,750
Yeah, like...

23
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,370
Like when people order like...

24
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,710
A bedroom set, and then it's a poster of a bedroom.

25
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,710
Oh well.

26
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,050
I'll still wear it.

27
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,190
I think it looks good on me anyway.

28
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,310
I was able to get the holo tickets.

29
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,290
Oh, is that today?

30
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,270
I'm not going.

31
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,610
I thought I would go, but...

32
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,330
I have too much going on in August.

33
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,510
Have fun for me!

34
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,610
Have fun for me!

35
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,330
But...

36
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:19,510
Oh!

37
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,070
Congrats on getting the tickets!

38
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,230
Also, Lost in the Store, they give you the 10 gifted!

39
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,910
And Curry Ninja, they give you the 5 gifted!

40
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,350
Thank you, thank you!

41
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,390
Not a fan of those wet pee shirts that are popping up recently.

42
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,430
I can...

43
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,470
I see the problem.

44
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,690
The seam doesn't connect to the collar, so the white filled took up the whole box.

45
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,170
Oh...

46
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,490
You're right!

47
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,950
Oh gosh.

48
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,310
They just don't make things like they used to anymore.

49
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,190
But anyway!

50
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,170
Welcome!

51
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,670
This will be a pretty short stream.

52
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,770
I just got home, like...

53
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,990
An hour ago.

54
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,190
And I was like...

55
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,690
I must...

56
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,810
I must watch this...

57
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,650
Watch along.

58
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,270
I must do it.

59
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,770
Or I must do a watch along of this.

60
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,910
Because...

61
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,670
I've been waiting all day.

62
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,210
How was your trip?

63
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:23,670
It was good!

64
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,150
It was...

65
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,330
I actually...

66
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,590
I will not say anything about it right now.

67
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,830
You will hear about it eventually.

68
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,930
Hopefully within like a week.

69
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,550
I got paid.

70
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,830
So I'm here to pay the mint phantom tax.

71
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,850
There's no tax!

72
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:43,690
There's no tax!

73
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,230
Thank you for the super tapichi!

74
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,010
I love magnesium sulfide too.

75
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,110
What a coinkydink.

76
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,710
Saving it for the podcast?

77
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,970
I'm saving it.

78
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,370
Yeah.

79
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,230
Pretty much.

80
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,830
Which actually...

81
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,130
We got to record that tomorrow.

82
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,110
Hold on.

83
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,930
Let me message Metara.

84
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,550
You...

85
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,510
You still...

86
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,550
You...

87
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,630
Still good for the podcast.

88
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:13,970
Tomorrow.

89
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,130
Recording.

90
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,150
Haruka!

91
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,350
Thank you for the...

92
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,170
Gifted.

93
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,830
Thank you!

94
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,610
Heard something about tax?

95
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,150
No!

96
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,510
Hello boss.

97
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,350
Good to have you.

98
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:30,690
Oh my god.

99
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,590
Why is there so much...

100
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,710
What's happening?

101
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:33,930
Tax?

102
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,890
No, no, no!

103
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:35,950
What's happening?

104
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:36,970
Why are there so many super tax?

105
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,530
All of a sudden.

106
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,370
Matthews.

107
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:40,630
Thank you.

108
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:40,830
Nerdy.

109
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,210
Thank you.

110
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:41,650
Delerant.

111
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,070
Thank you.

112
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,290
Spark.

113
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:42,790
Thank you.

114
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,810
Thank you guys.

115
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,170
Okay.

116
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,730
I know nothing of this.

117
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:59,690
So basically, Konami had this Metal Gear production hotline number one.

118
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,750
So we're going to be getting more than one of these.

119
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,090
Which is kind of crazy.

120
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,190
And it's only like 20 minutes long as you can see.

121
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,610
I don't know at all.

122
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,810
What we'll be talking about.

123
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,090
Stop!

124
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,090
Watch along V.

125
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,010
And...

126
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,970
But I think they will be talking about Metal Gear.

127
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,290
And I like that.

128
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,470
So I'm going to watch it.

129
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,850
Will it even be in English?

130
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,330
It literally says in the title with English subtitles.

131
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,090
So you're good.

132
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,330
You're Gooch.

133
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,190
You're Gucci.

134
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,690
You're all good.

135
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,030
No worries.

136
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,050
Okay.

137
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:40,790
Okay.

138
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,170
We are done.

139
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:41,310
Just a minute.

140
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,110
I just heard about the midfed.

141
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:43,750
The Murad.

142
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,330
Oh my gosh you guys.

143
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:47,710
Stop!

144
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,250
I'm Furphy.

145
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,150
Thanks for the vibe gifted.

146
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:51,830
Oh my gosh, TK.

147
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,630
Thank you for the ping.

148
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,030
Don't worry guys, I've got the tags this time.

149
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:55,550
Stop!

150
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,090
Stop!

151
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:01,770
Sayonara!

152
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,190
Okane!

153
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,450
Watch a long ticket.

154
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,770
This is getting out of hand, man.

155
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,490
This is getting out of hand.

156
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,250
I would like to watch this now, please.

157
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,190
May I?

158
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,350
May I watch this?

159
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,510
I've been waiting patiently all day.

160
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,870
Bravo Chief, thanks for the 5k.

161
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,630
Choco Minto, tax, tax, tax!

162
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,970
Minto stinky?

163
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,070
I'm starting.

164
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,970
I'm ignoring you guys now.

165
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,790
She hates our money.

166
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,690
This is my tax refund.

167
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,650
I ain't paying my taxes.

168
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,570
It's 20 minutes and 57 seconds for you.

169
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,650
Well, look at you living in 2035.

170
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,490
We're all here in 2024.

171
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,050
That's when they introduced that they can edit videos.

172
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,670
And they added in one extra second to say...

173
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,710
Frick roll!

174
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,290
Can you imagine?

175
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,080
That's what they put in.

176
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,220
The extra second is what it says.

177
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,100
Good bit, boss.

178
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,640
Shut up!

179
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,000
I love MSG.

180
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,560
No, no!

181
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,240
Okay, you scared me for a second.

182
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,660
I thought I accidentally wrote that.

183
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,180
I mean, bought that.

184
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,320
What if I got a shirt that says I heart MSG?

185
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,900
I believe that it exists.

186
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,240
Mint tax.

187
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,800
Remember to let go all those nerd energy.

188
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,240
Nerd energy.

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,660
I do love MSG though.

190
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,280
You know what?

191
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,620
Me too.

192
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,060
I like MSG also.

193
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,240
Makes things taste real delicious.

194
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,720
Okay, so yeah.

195
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,860
They're just gonna talk...

196
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,200
We're just gonna react to this.

197
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,340
Sorry, I'm a react YouTuber now.

198
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,680
Stop!

199
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
Thank you for the pink lost!

200
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,220
Mint tax.

201
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,460
This is ridiculous.

202
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,500
I hope you're happy.

203
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,760
Madison Square Garden.

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,020
No, no, no, no.

205
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,040
That would be the MSG.

206
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,300
Madison Garden Square.

207
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,560
They renamed it.

208
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,020
To fix the...

209
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,180
Like, you know, they misprinted all of these t-shirts.

210
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,140
They were like, we can't sell this.

211
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,880
There's nothing in the world called MGS.

212
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,080
And so, they were like, we'll just rename it from Madison Square Garden to Madison Garden Square.

213
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,940
TK, thank you for the 50 adopts.

214
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,540
Thank you.

215
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,000
What the heck?

216
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,700
Thank you so much!

217
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,140
I wanna talk about my trip.

218
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,120
But I will refrain.

219
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,560
I will refrain.

220
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,040
I will refrain.

221
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,040
And I'll talk about it another day.

222
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,360
Because right now...

223
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,920
Metal Gear time.

224
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,300
OK.

225
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,740
Let me turn off my music.

226
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,920
TA-DA!

227
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,060
Let me turn off my music.

228
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,440
Let me turn the volume up here.

229
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,360
Let me move out of the way.

230
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,060
I'm gonna cover you guys so everybody can see my cool shirt here.

231
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,360
I'll even... There we go.

232
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,720
I want everybody to see my cool shirt.

233
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,360
Why are you guys sending so much DocTalk?

234
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,820
It is E-O-F-Y.

235
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,560
What is that?

236
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,340
Wait, what does that mean?

237
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,120
Embodiment of Phantomir.

238
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,340
Oh,

239
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,500
end of fiscal year!

240
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,940
Oh, I got the year part right.

241
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,440
I'm such a genius.

242
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,600
End of Phantomir.

243
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,320
No!

244
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,080
And then I just disintegrate like Thanos snapped me out of existence.

245
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,120
We love our ghostly, bustin' mind and our obsession with tactical espionage action.

246
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,320
Oh my gosh, my bag shipped.

247
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,600
My, my, my metal bag shipped.

248
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,180
Oh, gear bag.

249
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,100
I'm so excited.

250
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,620
I heart MGS.

251
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,080
Mint ghost streamer.

252
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,880
Let me guys, let me know, let me, let me know guys if you would like this as official, um, official t-shirt merch.

253
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,320
It would not be a t-shirt that says I heart MGS.

254
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,100
It would be a t-shirt of this t-shirt that says I heart MGS.

255
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,720
A t-shirt of a t-shirt.

256
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,380
I haven't watched this either.

257
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,040
I hope it's cool.

258
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,060
I hope so too!

259
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,940
I'm excited to hear more stuff about Delta.

260
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,180
And like I said, I don't really know what else.

261
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,360
I think some people were speculating that there might be talks of the Master Collection number 2.

262
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,860
So maybe.

263
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,920
We'll see.

264
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,980
I don't know.

265
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,300
I don't know.

266
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,080
Everything's a mystery.

267
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,260
I heart MF.

268
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,880
Are you a MF?

269
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,940
Are you a MF-er?

270
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,580
Hmm.

271
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,220
MGS4, please.

272
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,120
I know, right?

273
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,220
Alright.

274
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,020
Are you guys ready?

275
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,800
There's not really a countdown because I'm just gonna play it on the screen.

276
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,340
But, um...

277
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,280
We'll watch it.

278
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,280
It's only 20 minutes and then we can talk more afterwards.

279
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,240
Sound good?

280
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,000
Sound good?

281
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,000
Ready?

282
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,520
We are MF-er!

283
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,400
It's me.

284
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,240
I'm MF-er.

285
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,880
Okie dokie!

286
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,040
Sounds good.

287
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,820
Okie dokie.

288
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,620
I'm just gonna play it and I can adjust the audio as we go.

289
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,060
Give me one second too.

290
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,180
Ok.

291
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,880
It needs to be a mint ghost solid t-shirt.

292
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,260
With you in a liquid snake co- Why am I in a liquid snake costume?

293
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,280
You're just trying to get me shirtless.

294
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,140
You sneaky!

295
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,560
I see right through your plans.

296
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,260
Baby car!

297
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,620
Thanks for the gift.

298
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,800
Okie dokie.

299
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,740
Are we good now?

300
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,280
Yeah, Liquid, you guys, is naked.

301
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,400
I mean, not naked.

302
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,600
He has no shirt on.

303
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,180
Please God, Peace Walker on Master Collection Part 2.

304
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,800
Alright, let's start.

305
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,520
We won't...

306
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,280
My next video is busted.

307
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,870
No way.

308
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,910
That's so funny.

309
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,490
That's so funny.

310
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,210
It knows.

311
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,490
It really does know.

312
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,210
Ok.

313
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,910
Metal Gear Production Hotline.

314
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,190
I wonder why they started...

315
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,950
It started.

316
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,350
Metal Gear Production Hotline.

317
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,470
Oh, let me move the...

318
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:15,750
This show is brought to you by Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater's latest information, questions from viewers, and questions from fans.

319
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,350
My questions.

320
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,830
Oh my god, it's the opening!

321
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,450
Oh my god, it's the opening!

322
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,150
Is it the... oh, look at all the credits.

323
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,090
Yoroshiku Onegai Itashimasu.

324
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,090
They're going so fast.

325
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,830
I cannot even think like I can comment.

326
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,270
Yoroshiku Onegai Itashimasu.

327
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,910
And this is the producer, Noriaki Okamura.

328
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,450
Please introduce yourself, Okamura-san.

329
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:56,690
I am the producer of the Metal Gear series, Okamura-san.

330
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:03,090
I sent this live stream to Okamura-san, Oishi-san.

331
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,450
And today, I would like to introduce one more person.

332
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,610
This is the creative producer, Yuji Korekado.

333
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,410
Please introduce yourself.

334
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,290
I am Konami's Korekado.

335
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,350
Nice to meet you.

336
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,290
Nice to meet you, too.

337
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,170
I have worked on many Metal Gear series.

338
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,150
I was the director of the second Metal Gear Online series.

339
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,070
I was the producer of the Metal Gear Rising series and the Metal Gear Survival series.

340
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,630
I am also the creative producer of the Metal Gear Delta series.

341
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,850
Thank you very much.

342
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,230
Thank you very much.

343
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,970
Oishi-san, the production hotline has started.

344
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,530
How is the audio?

345
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,950
I will turn it up just a little bit.

346
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,190
The instrumental is making me emotional.

347
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,550
First reveal!

348
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,310
Technical previews!

349
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,250
It's good?

350
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,390
Okay.

351
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,030
Yeah.

352
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:08,890
Yeah.

353
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,070
Yeah.

354
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,110
You read that script.

355
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,770
Wait, what does the SE stand for?

356
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,830
Metal Gear?

357
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,330
Oh, Snake Eater.

358
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,950
Oh, gosh.

359
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,510
I'm so scared.

360
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:26,990
Never mind.

361
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,030
Editor, cut that from the VOD, please.

362
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,690
Special edition.

363
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,050
Special edition.

364
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:37,690
Special edition.

365
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,470
Special edition.

366
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,430
As soon as I, like, said it, then it just...

367
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,710
Oh, it came to me.

368
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,090
Oh, this is the one that they showed before, right?

369
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,270
Oh, it looks so good.

370
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,450
Oh, paramedic looks so cute.

371
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,370
They added, like, the lens flare from Five.

372
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:11,930
It's a snake.

373
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,290
Where's the pee filter?

374
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,530
It's toggleable.

375
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,550
They've already said that.

376
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,310
That's gonna be me.

377
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,290
Oh, my gosh.

378
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:31,890
I love...

379
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,050
I love that the Croc mouth kind of opens and closes.

380
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,690
It's so cute.

381
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,570
Ew!

382
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,970
God, he's gross!

383
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,230
Oh, my gosh.

384
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,170
I bet he tastes like a wild beast.

385
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,010
One man army.

386
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:52,410
God.

387
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,590
Okay, the one thing is he better do his little flips in the air.

388
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,490
I swear.

389
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,170
They took that out of the patchy slot game.

390
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,490
Speak.

391
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:07,870
Speak.

392
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:09,950
Speak.

393
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:11,910
Speak.

394
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,830
Speak.

395
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,110
Speak.

396
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,430
Speak.

397
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,370
Speak.

398
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:18,530
Speak.

399
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:19,350
Speak.

400
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:19,950
Oh, there he is.

401
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,810
The

402
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,960
boss!

403
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,860
Oh, it's such a good trailer!

404
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,080
Oh, it's so good!

405
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,520
Did they... for the Japanese, actually I don't...

406
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,380
Yeah!

407
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:05,240
I do like it.

408
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,360
Gonna play with Japanese voices?

409
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:09,880
No, no.

410
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,700
Gonna play with the English voices.

411
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,680
It is really good in Japanese, though.

412
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,240
But... I love the English.

413
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,820
Dubbed so much.

414
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,160
Yeah!

415
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,980
Metal Gear Production Hotline!

416
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:42,440
It's like one of those rare series that I play in English, you know?

417
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,220
They speak English canonically?

418
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,420
They're speaking Russian sometimes.

419
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,340
Visual.

420
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,460
Look at that little crocodile!

421
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,340
Oh my god, the Russian jungles.

422
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,620
Little crab!

423
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,580
He's a frog!

424
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,520
We've seen all these, though.

425
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,060
Oh, the Easter Delta signify change.

426
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,180
Mm.

427
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,500
Bullet holes!

428
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,600
Look at how muddy he is.

429
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,520
Ah!

430
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,340
Oh my god!

431
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,840
Oh my god, he's actually got, like, bullet holes and stuff!

432
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,540
Oh!

433
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:37,700
Oh!

434
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,820
Oh!

435
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,760
Oh!

436
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:42,980
Oh!

437
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,440
Oh!

438
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,240
Crouch!

439
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,140
Crouch walking!

440
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,260
Yippee!

441
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,140
They only added that to Metal Gear Solid, or to MGS3.

442
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,460
Ah!

443
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,360
They only added it in the 3DS version.

444
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,700
But playing this game on the 3DS is, uh...

445
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,740
Oh!

446
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,320
Oh!

447
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:09,720
Oh!

448
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,620
Wait!

449
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:10,880
Wait!

450
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,460
Oh!

451
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,400
Oh!

452
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,540
Oh!

453
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,480
Oh my god.

454
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,600
Wait, who's asking for this?

455
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,280
Oh, wait.

456
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,480
Ah!

457
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,480
Ah!

458
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,520
Wait.

459
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,840
It's like...

460
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,280
Not kissy enough.

461
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,640
I think.

462
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,940
He's asking for full...

463
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,420
Full stuff-ia mode.

464
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:33,960
.

465
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,860
.

466
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:34,920
.

467
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,000
.

468
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,200
.

469
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,380
.

470
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:36,460
.

471
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:36,500
.

472
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:36,540
.

473
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:36,980
.

474
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,160
.

475
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,180
.

476
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,200
.

477
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,100
Black and white.

478
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,400
.

479
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,640
The...

480
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:46,960
The...

481
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,080
The Instagram filter really gets me, though.

482
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,500
.

483
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,040
.

484
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,640
.

485
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,040
.

486
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,260
.

487
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,520
.

488
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:53,900
.

489
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,680
.

490
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:54,720
.

491
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:54,760
.

492
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:54,800
.

493
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:54,860
.

494
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,420
.

495
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:55,440
.

496
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,620
I think it's been a long time.

497
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,040
.

498
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,160
.

499
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,560
.

500
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,240
.

501
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,340
.

502
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:22,580
.

503
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:22,660
.

504
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,180
.

505
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,140
.

506
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,340
.

507
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:30,440
.

508
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,560
.

509
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:30,620
.

510
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:30,640
.

511
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:51,120
Really, it looks like they're paying attention to the criticisms, which I think is good, too.

512
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,240
Why are there more people saying it's very bad over bad?

513
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,600
Oh, goodness.

514
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,420
So they were like, it was fine, but we want to see more, for the most part.

515
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,660
Oh, my God.

516
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,400
This is mucho texto.

517
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,640
Oh, my God.

518
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,680
People tend to choose extreme options.

519
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,480
I guess that's true.

520
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,040
Especially, I don't know, Japan's kind of...

521
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,060
Even the bad and negative, you can't even do a simple remaster, right?

522
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,040
Metal Gear is dead and you're the ones who killed it?

523
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,660
Oh, my God.

524
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,740
Oh, my God.

525
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,400
They're brave.

526
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,860
This is...

527
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:09,320
This is a level of self-awareness that I did not expect to see from them.

528
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,120
Oh, my God.

529
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:12,900
I love it.

530
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt.

531
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,480
They're taking that as positive and not neutral.

532
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,640
Give us English subs.

533
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,780
This is a brave conference.

534
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,160
I respect this a lot, actually.

535
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,160
I think I respect this a lot.

536
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,100
More so than just like, you know, kind of like, you know.

537
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,240
Thinking they're the shit, you know?

538
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,380
They kind of realize that people are...

539
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,800
Being very critical of them.

540
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,580
... being very critical of them.

541
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,160
Being very critical of them.

542
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:53,900
.

543
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,200
.

544
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,300
.

545
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:57,820
.

546
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:57,980
.

547
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,060
.

548
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,140
.

549
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,660
.

550
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:58,940
.

551
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,100
I'm doing years of bed.

552
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,220
They are dedicated.

553
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,720
I think it helps that you have so many...

554
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,580
or rather you have a handful of people from the original.

555
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,680
So they understand how important this is.

556
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,840
Like the original devs or team.

557
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,540
Team.

558
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,960
Aren't there already?

559
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,620
Maybe they are saying outside the company.

560
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,660
They would come back.

561
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,660
Of course, if I were to talk about myself, I would like to work with the staff, including Kojima-san.

562
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,000
Do you want to say that?

563
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,800
But many people are already on the new path.

564
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:25,700
And among them, the fact that they are cooperating with us, is a prerequisite.

565
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,520
Because they have a bright future and an independent future.

566
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,520
I think that we are the ones who should do that.

567
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,580
I think we should do our best to be able to be highly evaluated.

568
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,280
I think that we should do our best to be able to be highly evaluated.

569
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:52,120
And we have a question that you guys often ask about, I think the name of Kojima-san...

570
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,680
Master Collection is the next Delta...

571
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,060
Oh my god!

572
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,480
Wait, so they're going to be also in...

573
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,060
They're going to be credited in Delta?

574
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,240
Oh my god!

575
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,980
Oh my god!

576
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Oh, okay, so the Japanese is also the same.

577
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,240
Yippee!

578
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,580
So they had to probably redo some of that stuff.

579
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,460
That makes sense, though.

580
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,360
Oh!

581
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,460
AI?

582
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,980
Oh my gosh, Grammy!

583
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,180
Thanks for the request!

584
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,540
Did you watch this already?

585
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,540
Thanks for the request!

586
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,840
But it's not uncommon for them to have, like, a bunch of recorded lines and stuff, and...

587
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,640
Mix and match stuff.

588
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,620
I don't know.

589
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,000
Who knows if it's AI?

590
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,580
Oh, you guys are the gifters.

591
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,280
Yeah, splicing, yeah, yeah, yeah.

592
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,820
She's so cute!

593
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,400
Really?

594
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,680
To buy a box engine?

595
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:16,700
.

596
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,060
.

597
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,720
.

598
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,180
.

599
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,640
But also, if the person is, like, you know...

600
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,440
Not available and that they are not of this realm anymore, I don't think it can be helped.

601
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,400
.

602
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,360
I'm curious about the series, but...

603
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,360
.

604
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,160
.

605
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,840
.

606
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,080
.

607
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,300
.

608
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,060
.

609
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,240
.

610
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,620
.

611
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,900
.

612
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:53,980
.

613
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:07,240
I'm curious about the series, but...

614
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,180
.

615
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,880
.

616
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,260
.

617
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:14,560
.

618
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:14,780
.

619
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,000
.

620
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,100
.

621
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,120
.

622
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,200
.

623
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,380
.

624
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,500
.

625
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:17,540
.

626
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,940
.

627
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,220
I'm curious about the series, but...

628
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:29,460
.

629
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:29,960
.

630
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,160
.

631
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,220
.

632
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,440
.

633
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,700
.

634
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:32,740
.

635
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,020
.

636
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:38,900
.

637
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,400
.

638
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:45,520
.

639
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:45,600
.

640
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:45,620
.

641
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,140
.

642
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,620
.

643
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:46,720
.

644
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:46,840
.

645
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,020
.

646
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,320
.

647
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,880
.

648
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,700
Oh!

649
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,980
I pre-ordered that!

650
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,940
I'm so excited, I love the art for it so much.

651
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,500
I'm excited to just display it.

652
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,960
Put me on the box, just like the pause.

653
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,540
I always recommend MGS3 first.

654
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,600
I can't!

655
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,040
Because...

656
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,860
Because basically...

657
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,120
I think of it also how the technology advances, you know?

658
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,240
Going from MGS3 to MGS1?

659
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,440
Or MGS3?

660
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,380
MGS5 to MGS1?

661
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,340
It's just so much.

662
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,320
In terms of like...

663
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,480
You know, other...

664
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,120
If you go and really sort or...

665
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,460
Improv!

666
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,580
Cushion!

667
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:24,840
Cushion!

668
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,780
Oh my god!

669
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,340
Not the tumblers!

670
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,200
I'm sorry, I love...

671
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,100
Oh my god, they're so cute!

672
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,080
No!

673
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,860
Oh my god!

674
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:42,840
October?

675
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,160
I won't be there!

676
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,820
Oh my god!

677
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,160
Sorry!

678
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,940
They're so cute!

679
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,600
They're so cute!

680
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,020
No!

681
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,400
No!

682
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:56,740
No!

683
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:56,820
No!

684
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:58,780
No!

685
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,580
No!

686
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,690
They're so cute!

687
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,000
Oh my goodness!

688
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,040
What the hell is this thing!?

689
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,480
.

690
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:08,500
.

691
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,780
.

692
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,040
.

693
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,140
.

694
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,120
We will post the link in the description box or on Metal Gear X official website.

695
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,780
We are looking forward to your comments.

696
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,360
So, this is the first episode of the Metal Gear production hotline.

697
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,240
How was it?

698
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,340
We will tell you more information next time.

699
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,280
And...

700
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,440
Actually, there is one more thing.

701
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,960
Wait, before we go, it's almost over?

702
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,600
This is the background.

703
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
This is the background of the title screen.

704
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,120
This is the opening image of the Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater.

705
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,660
We introduced this as a new opening image last time.

706
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,160
The original Snake Eater is also included.

707
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,780
So, it's either one?

708
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,400
Yes.

709
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,580
Can I see more of the game?

710
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,940
I explained the new style and the legacy style.

711
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,700
The new style is for the Zungle title.

712
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:06,860
Thank you.

713
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,420
Thank you.

714
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,660
If you play the legacy style, you will be able to see the old title.

715
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,880
So, each one is different.

716
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,740
Okay.

717
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,800
We are looking forward to the new information next time.

718
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,900
This is the end of the Metal Gear production hotline.

719
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,840
See you next time.

720
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,440
Thank you.

721
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,040
That's it?

722
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,540
Too short.

723
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,260
Oh my God!

724
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,340
It looks so good!

725
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:46,940
Man!

726
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:51,840
Man!

727
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,240
I wanted to see more of the game.

728
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,420
What

729
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,100
is this?

730
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,820
I was hoping to see more of the game.

731
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,820
Oh, wow.

732
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,540
I don't remember what music I had before.

733
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,440
I think it was this one.

734
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,100
Maybe.

735
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,060
Do I have to do frame by frame analysis now?

736
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,360
Hold on.

737
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,580
Actually, I do want to go back to these plushies.

738
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,640
Sorry.

739
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,900
Let me go back to these plushies.

740
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,520
Where are they?

741
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,240
Where are the plushies?

742
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,800
Where are the plushies?

743
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,880
Bustin' is up.

744
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,320
Oh, yeah.

745
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,100
Wait.

746
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,680
Where are they?

747
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,080
Oh my gosh.

748
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,640
And a floor!

749
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:49,920
You guys!

750
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,360
I'm not even kidding you.

751
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,800
You know those places where you can, like...

752
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,000
Okay.

753
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,500
So, there's sometimes places...

754
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:56,720
Hold on.

755
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,940
Everybody needs to see my t-shirt.

756
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,680
There are places where you can, like, go and make your own rug.

757
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,500
You basically, like, bring in a design and they print it out for you.

758
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,540
And then they help you, like...

759
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,440
And you make it yourself.

760
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:09,820
You're like...

761
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,120
And I was gonna do that with the Foxhound logo, but I was like, there's no way.

762
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,540
Like, it's too detailed.

763
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,580
It wouldn't look good.

764
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,120
But I really wanted it.

765
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,920
But now I can just get a mad end-up cushion!

766
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,240
I don't really care about the newer Foxhound logo.

767
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,880
I care about middle Foxhound logo.

768
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,720
I like this one.

769
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,480
I like this one the most.

770
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,620
I think it's the most iconic.

771
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,520
It's official, too.

772
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,200
I know!

773
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,980
Thank you so much for the 5k update!

774
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,160
Oh, hold on.

775
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,020
This one...

776
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,000
The tumblers!

777
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,200
Wait, so is it...

778
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:49,900
Oh, yes!

779
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,740
Okay, so this must be the front and the back.

780
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,040
And then you have MGS1, 2, and 3.

781
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,180
But the original metal...

782
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,120
Look at the original metal gear!

783
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,360
Okay, what the hell is going on?

784
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,080
Are there, like, three rays there?

785
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,260
They look so cute, though!

786
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,460
Yeah, you can see the shagohan kind of peeking out from the corner.

787
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,000
Little Godly is such a pixel man!

788
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,160
Oh my gosh!

789
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,020
Raiden is a skinny legend here.

790
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,760
What's up with that?

791
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,240
Rex Ray and the shagohan.

792
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:25,720
Yeah!

793
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,490
The rays...

794
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,110
Yeah, it's interesting, though, that they put multiple.

795
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,030
I mean, I guess you do fight multiple.

796
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,670
It's just funny.

797
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:39,530
Oh...

798
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,810
Before the thickening.

799
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,470
I can't wait to drink out of these and only these.

800
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:46,950
Actually, no.

801
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,010
I own some metal gear mugs.

802
00:39:49,970 --> 00:40:00,330
It's 2, 3, and Peace Walker, I believe, are the only three that they released.

803
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,690
And I don't use them, though.

804
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,190
I keep them in my cabinet.

805
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,130
Or rather, in my store.

806
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,910
Like, I keep them with my Metal Gear collection.

807
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,730
These are shot glasses.

808
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,850
No, I think these are, like, full-sized tumblers.

809
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,810
Like a regular cup.

810
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,590
Stainless steel tumbler.

811
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:21,610
Yeah.

812
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,310
Printed with iterations of Metal Gear and Snake.

813
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,830
And the other characters hiding in the rivers.

814
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,410
And...

815
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:45,830
I think they wereorned?

816
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:45,830
I

817
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,420
think they wereorned.

818
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,820
And I think I saw little rouge in them and it's just...

819
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:05,600
They were quantinin- Oh, there's some music.

820
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,200
They're so cute.

821
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,500
Oh my gosh, their little feet sticking out.

822
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,260
I can't wait.

823
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,820
Wait, I wonder how big they are.

824
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,740
I'm gonna waste all my money at the claw machines.

825
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,980
They're so cute.

826
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,700
I love plushies.

827
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,400
Pocket-sized?

828
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,200
I can't tell.

829
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,400
If they're pocket-sized, I'm gonna have to get like 50 of them.

830
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,120
Don't cry, boys.

831
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,120
I can't help it.

832
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,100
That was the last thing, right?

833
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,100
And then, at the beginning here too...

834
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,740
They were talking about the stains and battle damage.

835
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,600
Yeah, the leaves.

836
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,200
It was like...

837
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,520
It's so great.

838
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,500
And he's got...

839
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,100
Look at that guy right there!

840
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,940
I love crocodiles.

841
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,020
They have a box of tissues at their desk for the next episode.

842
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,280
Why is it doing that though when he's walking by?

843
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,460
Look how gross he looks!

844
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,600
Oh my god, he's a muddy man!

845
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:30,580
Raindrop.

846
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,200
Choco Chip is back!

847
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,500
Go to naked.

848
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,480
Yippee!

849
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,330
The vein!

850
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,520
Snake...

851
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,860
Snake, you look cold.

852
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,320
Snake, you look cold.

853
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,320
Put on a t-shirt, please.

854
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,040
I offer you the shirt off my back.

855
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,680
Cover those up, sir, please!

856
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,880
Wait, he needs to be disinfected.

857
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:33,250
Actually, they are covered.

858
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,050
No nip...

859
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,610
No nip slips for you guys.

860
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,610
He is covered, actually.

861
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:42,410
He's a modest man.

862
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,030
Oh my god, he looks...

863
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,330
I can't stop!

864
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,070
I need to stop!

865
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:52,570
Even his back!

866
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,310
Oh my god.

867
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,530
He looks so good.

868
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,070
Ocelot's gonna freak!

869
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,730
He's such a tease.

870
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,090
Kyaa!

871
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:08,790
New style.

872
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,580
How did he know where to aim that thing?

873
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,880
I can't believe we can crouch run though now.

874
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,620
I don't know.

875
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,940
What do you guys think of the filter?

876
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:27,760
I don't know.

877
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,200
Like the...

878
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,020
I guess it does look pretty similar to the old...

879
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:31,620
To the original.

880
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,440
Now that I'm...

881
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:34,860
You know...

882
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,740
I think it just looks jarring to me because...

883
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,190
I think it looks jarring to me at first because like...

884
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,610
I'm used to seeing it...

885
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,610
This color...

886
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:48,910
In...

887
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:49,990
In...

888
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:51,090
In...

889
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:51,630
You know...

890
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,310
Not high def graphics.

891
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,470
Yeah, too much detail.

892
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,090
I think it could be...

893
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,350
I think it looks a little dark.

894
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,110
Maybe that's it.

895
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,790
Like it could be a little bit brighter and a little bit more yellow-y.

896
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,930
But also we're only seeing it in like...

897
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,090
Minimal scenes.

898
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:11,730
You know?

899
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,370
So...

900
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,370
So we don't know.

901
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,030
It could be...

902
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,550
It could look better in like...

903
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:16,950
You know...

904
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,190
But also...

905
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,090
Who is...

906
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:20,570
Who is...

907
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:21,170
Who?

908
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,110
Who is making this?

909
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:25,750
Who?

910
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,550
Who asked for this?

911
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:34,310
I like this!

912
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,680
Such a lust for Sepia!

913
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,580
Whoo!

914
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,520
Sepia?

915
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,320
Sepia?

916
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,500
Sepia?

917
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,880
I'm really curious how H.D.Ocelot will look meowing.

918
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,320
No, right?

919
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,440
If you wanna feel like...

920
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,640
Old cat, like...

921
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:55,900
Oh!

922
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,880
This is like...

923
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,800
You know...

924
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,320
You were like...

925
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:58,740
Oh my gosh!

926
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,000
I actually called Konami personally for this.

927
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,560
Oh my gosh!

928
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,220
You did it!

929
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,100
Best filter.

930
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,180
Okay, this one I can forgive.

931
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,880
It's this one.

932
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,140
It's Instagram Yasified Snake that I don't know what to do with.

933
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,340
My eyes!

934
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,820
It says retro, but it's literally...

935
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:43,560
It's literally... they're gonna have like speedruns for like the different... speedrun sepia, speedrun retro filter.

936
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,860
This is just an Instagram filter though.

937
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:55,320
We do have multiple color filters you can change between, applicable whether you are playing new style or legacy style.

938
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,520
One option closely recreates the original palette so you can play with your preferred look.

939
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,900
So what was it?

940
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,320
Okay, hold on.

941
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,030
So this... oh, nope, that's not normal.

942
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,630
That's not normal, that's not normal!

943
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,070
This is normal.

944
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,290
And then...

945
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,560
No!

946
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,540
Why are you lying to me?

947
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,040
This is legacy.

948
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,620
I'm trying to go back.

949
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,400
I'm trying to go back and forth more quickly, but it's like the little preview is lying to me.

950
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:36,840
You see that?

951
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,300
Normal.

952
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:44,980
Legacy.

953
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:51,430
J and L.

954
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,070
Oh, wow!

955
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:53,730
What?

956
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,840
And that... hold on, let me pull up a picture.

957
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,740
Metal Gear Solid 3.

958
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,300
Just so I can have like a visual...

959
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,020
In my face visual.

960
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:19,840
Let's see.

961
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,940
Let me pick...

962
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,800
Lighter greens.

963
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,560
Hold on.

964
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,780
Let's see.

965
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,300
I'm just trying to find a screenshot of him like standing in the forest.

966
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,880
Snake Eater.

967
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,640
Ahem.

968
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,820
Snake Eater.

969
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,160
Snake Eater.

970
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,960
I don't want to use this picture, but it might be the best thing.

971
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,340
Hold on.

972
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,140
Sorry.

973
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,960
I'm trying to find a decent picture to pull up on the screen.

974
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,760
Maybe this one.

975
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:04,660
Thank you!

976
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,660
Have you seen the edit where someone put David Hader and Laurie Allen's face?

977
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,240
I did!

978
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,940
Where they put him on the snake and the boss.

979
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,780
It does look really good.

980
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,520
I have seen it.

981
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:17,840
Okay.

982
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,040
So this is what we have.

983
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,700
And this is what it is like.

984
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,340
I think it only looks...

985
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,140
It actually is pretty accurate.

986
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,840
I think again, it only looks different because...

987
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,520
Well, actually the one from the original...

988
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,980
The original one looks a little bit more blue-hued.

989
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,460
But I think it's just because it's higher def, it looks different.

990
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,320
Yeah.

991
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,260
Less foggy.

992
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,020
Mmm.

993
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:45,420
Mmm.

994
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:45,720
Mmm.

995
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,440
Mmm.

996
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:47,820
Mmm.

997
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,900
The color is actually pretty accurate.

998
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,440
Pretty similar.

999
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,980
And then when you compare it to...

1000
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,380
The normal?

1001
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,360
Yeah!

1002
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,540
Again, I think it's like the fog and the...

1003
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,520
Just the blurriness of like the PS...

1004
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,480
You know, the PS2.

1005
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:09,920
So...

1006
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,940
That's gonna...

1007
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,420
You know...

1008
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,520
That's just...

1009
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,620
It's just lower quality.

1010
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,700
I think there's more blue hints...

1011
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,040
Blue hues rather...

1012
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:20,460
In the...

1013
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,780
In the original though.

1014
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,940
From what I can see.

1015
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:25,760
Oops, sorry.

1016
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,040
Can we get an option?

1017
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,220
We get a lower poly?

1018
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:30,800
I know!

1019
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,880
That would be so fun!

1020
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,100
That would be a really good like camo to have.

1021
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:36,560
Or...

1022
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,040
You know how like at the beginning...

1023
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:38,500
You're just like...

1024
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,780
I like MGS3.

1025
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,700
I like MGS2.

1026
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,580
I like Metal Gear Solid.

1027
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,540
You know how you can pick that?

1028
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:44,880
At the beginning?

1029
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:45,520
If you pick...

1030
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,820
I like Metal Gear Solid 3.

1031
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,100
That...

1032
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,420
It gives you...

1033
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:50,600
Um...

1034
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,560
A mask that...

1035
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,680
Has Snake's PS2 face.

1036
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,860
I think would be funny.

1037
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,850
Can't wait to play with the retro filter.

1038
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:15,530
Hmm...

1039
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,250
Yeah...

1040
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:16,890
So it's not so...

1041
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:17,730
It's actually pretty...

1042
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:18,370
Accurate.

1043
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:21,630
And it does say that they're...

1044
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:22,090
You know...

1045
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:22,550
They're...

1046
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:22,790
Re...

1047
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,530
Closely recreating the original game.

1048
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,670
I think they...

1049
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:29,350
I mean that was a huge people...

1050
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,570
A huge complaint from people so...

1051
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,070
Andragos thanks for the 10 gifted!

1052
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:34,750
This though...

1053
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:35,690
Hold on...

1054
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:36,130
Hold on...

1055
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:36,790
Hold on...

1056
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:37,350
Hold on...

1057
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:38,090
Also...

1058
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,790
We skipped over...

1059
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:40,930
Some...

1060
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:41,530
Where's the...

1061
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:42,390
This is...

1062
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,230
Where's the Shitsumon corner?

1063
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:45,090
Oh...

1064
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:46,010
It was after...

1065
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:46,450
Wait...

1066
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:47,730
Here...

1067
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:47,930
Here...

1068
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:48,110
Here...

1069
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:48,510
Here...

1070
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,230
Here...

1071
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:49,950
Here...

1072
00:51:54,180 --> 00:52:01,540
Is there any chance that the original staff members will return to work on co-develop or supervise any of the Metal Gear series?

1073
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,180
This...

1074
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:04,940
This...

1075
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,240
This...

1076
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,660
I bit my tongue...

1077
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,520
This...

1078
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,300
Hello?

1079
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:11,660
Hello?

1080
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:19,940
I'm...

1081
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:21,840
Shocked...

1082
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,920
It's not my place to answer these questions.

1083
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,960
I don't want to answer on behalf of anyone outside of the company...

1084
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,720
Or to guess how they might feel about it...

1085
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,380
But just speaking for myself personally...

1086
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:36,780
But they...

1087
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,160
But...

1088
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,280
The fact that...

1089
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,720
Konami allowed him to say this...

1090
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,540
Really surprises me...

1091
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,020
You know?

1092
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,040
To work with Kojima and the rest of the team again...

1093
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,860
If that could happen...

1094
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,000
That would be a dream...

1095
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,200
That's insane!

1096
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:53,920
That's insane!

1097
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:00,810
I wonder how Kojima-san feels about that...

1098
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,390
I just want to hear Sigan ask me why I'm naked when I call him...

1099
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,230
And he will...

1100
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:06,810
Patience...

1101
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:12,410
I'm very...

1102
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:15,430
Very curious...

1103
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:19,850
Up until now, it seemed like they tried to do everything to not say Kojima...

1104
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:20,570
Yeah...

1105
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:23,130
Ummm...

1106
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:23,910
I...

1107
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:25,490
I...

1108
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:28,250
I see comments in the chat...

1109
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,210
And I will not... read them.

1110
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:34,890
You guys have your own opinions... and such.

1111
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:39,530
I... would like to one day be sponsored.

1112
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:56,430
So I... I will just say that this...

1113
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,790
this is probably the most shocking thing...

1114
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,590
of the whole hotline.

1115
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,450
But my favorite part...

1116
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,750
is... not him.

1117
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:08,630
Sorry.

1118
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,190
This chat loves Konami!

1119
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:19,150
Yippee!

1120
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:22,830
I only just realized we can spin Snake.

1121
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:24,810
Oh yeah!

1122
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,110
Can we spin Snake and make him sick in the menu?

1123
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:28,770
I sure hope so, oh my gosh.

1124
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:29,970
I wanna make him barf.

1125
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,350
I wanna make this man barf.

1126
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,050
Look, look, look.

1127
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,410
This is a guy who's ready to barf.

1128
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,340
That's a good question to send.

1129
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,200
I think, yeah.

1130
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,040
I think maybe a good question would be...

1131
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,880
how much... how many features from the game will be...

1132
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,220
kept...

1133
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,520
in the remake?

1134
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,120
Such as like, you know, that.

1135
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,920
And what new features will they be...

1136
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,500
I guess they can't say what new...

1137
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,520
Or rather...

1138
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,580
Will the old features be kept?

1139
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,440
And will any new features be added?

1140
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,300
You know?

1141
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,440
I think what people...

1142
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,780
When you talk about, you know...

1143
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,500
When you talk about the relationship...

1144
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:23,700
Between...

1145
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,660
Both companies...

1146
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,700
Both parties, rather.

1147
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,440
I think...

1148
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,920
First of all...

1149
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,540
Literally no one in this chat was there.

1150
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,280
And also...

1151
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,100
You know, time...

1152
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:42,580
I think...

1153
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,800
Times are different, and so...

1154
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,080
You can't always think that...

1155
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,440
Opinions that once were, are the same.

1156
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:53,660
Actually...

1157
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,020
I'm John Konami.

1158
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,520
So...

1159
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,740
I don't know.

1160
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,800
I'm more of an optimist, I suppose.

1161
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,520
In that regard.

1162
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,740
Where I feel like that relationships...

1163
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,800
Because, you know...

1164
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,140
I've...

1165
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,720
You know...

1166
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,320
I've had friendships end and then rekindle.

1167
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,060
So I think that...

1168
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,840
Relationships...

1169
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,740
Between things can...

1170
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,020
Be salvaged.

1171
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,200
So...

1172
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,240
That's my opinion on stuff.

1173
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:23,880
That's all.

1174
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:24,980
You know.

1175
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,040
And people like money.

1176
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:27,860
So true!

1177
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,320
And I think...

1178
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,680
With Kojima-san...

1179
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,500
He's definitely still loves Metal Gear.

1180
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,040
He's always retweeting stuff about it.

1181
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,580
And tweeting stuff himself about it.

1182
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,100
So...

1183
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,100
You know.

1184
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,900
I would never...

1185
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,780
I would not say...

1186
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,720
You know, never say never.

1187
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,300
So...

1188
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:47,500
Yeah.

1189
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,480
That's all.

1190
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,000
That's all.

1191
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,780
I like money too!

1192
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:54,640
Oh my gosh!

1193
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,320
What a co-winky thing.

1194
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:00,880
But yeah.

1195
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:01,940
So...

1196
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,880
You're saying professional relationships can bloom even in the border.

1197
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,440
Perhaps.

1198
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,460
Perhaps.

1199
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,280
I don't know about love though.

1200
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:24,920
Contractual.

1201
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,400
Contractual.

1202
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:29,320
Something.

1203
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:31,420
Something.

1204
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:33,700
Contractual love.

1205
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:34,700
Thank you.

1206
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:38,310
Thank you.

1207
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:40,290
Is there such thing as an absolute timeless enemy?

1208
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:42,470
There's no such thing and never has been.

1209
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,870
And the reason is that our enemies are human beings like us.

1210
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:48,910
They can only be our enemies in relative terms.

1211
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,610
So Metal Gear.

1212
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:57,070
But...

1213
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:59,770
Will the movement be the same as MGS5?

1214
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:00,730
It's hard to say.

1215
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:01,630
They probably will be the same as MGS4.

1216
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:02,790
They didn't show us anything.

1217
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:05,770
They just said that there's remake mode and then there's...

1218
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:09,270
There's remake mode and then there's...

1219
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:11,850
Legacy mode.

1220
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:12,990
But also...

1221
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,830
I didn't see... What do they include in this timeline?

1222
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,230
We've seen this before though, right?

1223
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:19,070
This is on the website.

1224
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,290
Where's Snake's Revenge?

1225
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,350
That's the real Metal Gear 2!

1226
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,650
Where is it?

1227
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,040
Mint becomes a Metal Gear news channel?

1228
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,560
Feels a little like that, huh?

1229
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,100
She likes money!

1230
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:49,700
Get her!

1231
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,880
Where's Portable Ops?

1232
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,240
Yeah, they actually didn't put in Portable Ops.

1233
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,880
No Ghost Babble, no Portable Ops.

1234
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,920
I mean, Acid of course wouldn't be in here, but...

1235
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:06,470
Yeah, where's Ape Escape?

1236
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:14,310
No Rising?

1237
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,690
Well, Rising makes sense because...

1238
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,410
This is a Metal Gear Solid timeline.

1239
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:21,390
And that's Metal Gear Rising.

1240
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:24,210
Not Metal Gear Solid.

1241
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:27,030
So you can take that one to the bank.

1242
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,790
Metal Gear Rising 2.

1243
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,810
Metal Gear Solid Delta Peace Walker.

1244
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:42,590
I wonder... I do feel like they'll continue making these.

1245
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,030
But also...

1246
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:49,230
I don't know.

1247
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:53,070
I don't know how I'd feel about it.

1248
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,170
About them doing it.

1249
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:56,010
I mean, they don't need to do all the games, obviously.

1250
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,610
Like, Phantom Pain is totally fine.

1251
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,850
Even I'd say MGS4 is fine.

1252
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:02,570
I hate money.

1253
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,450
Get away from me, money!

1254
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:09,350
Rule of nature.

1255
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:18,230
And then, they did also say that, you know, the old team and Kojima's name will be...

1256
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:18,990
I don't know.

1257
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:19,730
It was kind of confusing.

1258
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:23,010
They said it was for the Master Collection, but...

1259
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,750
They didn't really mention if it was for Delta.

1260
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:29,490
They kind of scooted around that one.

1261
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:34,810
Do you think it was braver to name drop Kojima or MGS4 5?

1262
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:36,910
I think this whole...

1263
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:38,910
This thing... This whole...

1264
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:42,910
This whole hotline... I don't even know what to call it.

1265
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:45,830
This whole segment was so brave.

1266
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:47,360
Like, the questions...

1267
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,740
Like, this...

1268
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,300
This!

1269
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,720
Metal Gear is dead and you're the ones who killed it!

1270
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:02,890
Like, wow!

1271
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:05,550
Wow!

1272
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:11,350
And then, they took that comment and put it on the screen!

1273
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:15,850
They probably received, like, thousands of comments.

1274
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:17,710
And they were like, man, this one really...

1275
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,490
This one's really tell...

1276
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:23,690
And then they read it out loud!

1277
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:24,550
I know!

1278
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:26,990
It just felt like...

1279
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:30,050
With the negative ones, it just felt like arrow after arrow after...

1280
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:30,790
Also, this one.

1281
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:31,290
Based.

1282
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:35,590
They actually let us type whatever we want here.

1283
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:36,270
Based.

1284
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:40,090
Wait, I didn't see that one the first time!

1285
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:43,110
Oh, my God!

1286
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:56,930
Oh, my God!

1287
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:58,190
That's so funny!

1288
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,950
Who had to translate that for them?

1289
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:08,750
But, it's funny because the positive ones are so, like...

1290
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:11,830
Like, kind of neutral.

1291
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:15,590
I feel like you really do care, so I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt.

1292
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:18,230
It's like, don't fuck it up, you guys!

1293
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:21,890
Seeing Konami be ready to talk so openly with the fans is really great.

1294
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:22,410
This one's good.

1295
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:23,210
This one's nice.

1296
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:25,910
But it's also, like, kind of throwing shade, though.

1297
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:26,850
Because they're just, like...

1298
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:30,950
They're talking openly because everyone's shit-talking you guys!

1299
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:36,590
How did they translate based in JP?

1300
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:39,530
I can't read the kanji, so I can't tell you.

1301
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:48,220
Bring on some of the other MGS Delta Snake Eater dev staff, too.

1302
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,000
Can we see more gameplay or first reveal stuff?

1303
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,200
Yeah, we didn't really see...

1304
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,680
I guess first reveal stuff for this would be the survival menu.

1305
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,860
That was kind of all we got.

1306
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,240
English subs.

1307
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,280
You should answer more questions at a time.

1308
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:11,170
Base Dome.

1309
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:12,410
Ah, I think, yeah.

1310
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:17,970
Base Dome.

1311
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:24,890
And then, bugs that impact gameplay should have been fixed before release.

1312
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,470
This is about the Master Collection, obviously.

1313
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:31,330
You'll probably do a bad job on the next game, too.

1314
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:33,170
So I'd rather you just gave up!

1315
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,750
You can't even do a simple remaster, right?

1316
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:53,150
No punches pulled.

1317
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:57,830
What I like about them showing this, though, is that they are actually, like...

1318
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:01,390
It seems that they will read this and be like, Okay, we'll prove them wrong.

1319
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:02,210
You know?

1320
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:04,850
Like with the Master Collection, it did...

1321
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:06,490
When it first came out...

1322
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:08,850
Saying that there were...

1323
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:10,950
You know, you can't say that there were no issues.

1324
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:13,250
But they have gone...

1325
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,810
They have done so much to fix them.

1326
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:21,050
And I believe that the Master Collection also kind of went above and beyond in what they offered.

1327
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:24,010
In terms of, like, extra bonus stuff.

1328
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:26,190
Like with the soundtracks and...

1329
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:27,990
The, um...

1330
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:31,210
Like, orchestral remakes of the songs and the scripts.

1331
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,090
And adding, like...

1332
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:34,350
You know...

1333
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:35,670
Snake's Revenge.

1334
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:36,470
You know...

1335
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:36,710
...

1336
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:39,070
So, there is...

1337
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:41,170
I mean, obviously, it's positive and negative.

1338
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,590
Yeah, the comics...

1339
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:45,910
Like, they really...

1340
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:46,610
It really...

1341
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,810
Like, when they first were talking about it...

1342
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:51,390
It felt like that they were putting out a lot of care.

1343
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:54,250
And so...

1344
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:57,650
You know...

1345
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:00,290
When there were all the buggy issues with it...

1346
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:00,510
And...

1347
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:01,970
People...

1348
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:03,890
Were rightfully upset.

1349
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:04,470
You know?

1350
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:08,600
But...

1351
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:17,310
They're still working on it and it's not unusual right now for buggy releases to get left that way.

1352
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:26,790
Showing this level of negativity is a sign of them trying to show their sincerity, I think.

1353
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:28,370
That's how I feel about it too, right?

1354
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:29,350
Like, I feel...

1355
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:30,170
Like, this is...

1356
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:30,650
This is...

1357
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:32,630
These are really bad comments.

1358
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:34,490
So, I actually respect it.

1359
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:34,830
You know?

1360
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,610
I actually respect that they kind of put that out there.

1361
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,090
This is really bad.

1362
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:43,250
And then this...

1363
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:45,130
They just let us type whatever we want here.

1364
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:47,550
And then they put it on the screen.

1365
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:49,810
Then they choose it.

1366
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:54,470
Oh my gosh.

1367
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:55,130
What was this?

1368
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:56,510
This is all kind of like...

1369
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,550
Gone over pretty quickly.

1370
01:05:58,850 --> 01:05:59,810
And then even this.

1371
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:01,010
What did you think of the March episode?

1372
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:03,930
Only 52% said it was pretty good.

1373
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:04,810
Like, we're very good.

1374
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:11,870
Oh, information about Master Collection, Volume 2.

1375
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:13,470
M.G.O.

1376
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:13,810
Ni tsute.

1377
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:14,710
Oh.

1378
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:16,950
OK, there's nothing else.

1379
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:17,850
Mm-mm.

1380
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,230
Pretty good.

1381
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,170
Why didn't they say...

1382
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:24,930
Why didn't they translate it as pretty good?

1383
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:28,790
Well, I mean, I guess, tottemo yokatto does not mean pretty good.

1384
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:29,590
It means very good.

1385
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:30,450
But, you know...

1386
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:31,730
Come on!

1387
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:32,730
Just do the joke!

1388
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:33,710
It's a joke!

1389
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:34,810
I don't know.

1390
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:35,910
Do the joke!

1391
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:40,050
It makes sense.

1392
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:47,670
Yeah, what else would you like to see in the hotline?

1393
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:49,910
New info.

1394
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,050
Yeah, give me new info.

1395
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,370
What would other be?

1396
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:57,750
Maybe like, merchandise?

1397
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:00,410
Which we did kind of get that.

1398
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:07,750
They should give Revenge the twin snake style remake where the cutscenes are crazier and even more over the top.

1399
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,590
Yeah!

1400
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:12,990
Snake ducky.

1401
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:14,490
Snake undies!

1402
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,610
When are we getting this?

1403
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:23,310
It was only released in Europe.

1404
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:26,150
They released like a Shadow Moses perfume.

1405
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:27,650
Oh wait, not perfume.

1406
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:28,690
Cologne.

1407
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:31,750
I tried to buy it, but I couldn't.

1408
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,930
Snake fumo.

1409
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:35,390
That reminds me.

1410
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:36,730
I haven't checked AmiAmi today.

1411
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:37,930
To see if...

1412
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:40,770
To see if...

1413
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:41,770
Oh, my bad.

1414
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,870
Don't look at my stuff!

1415
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:47,670
To see if...

1416
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:50,970
There was a new...

1417
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:52,970
The snake figma is up yet.

1418
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:55,110
There we go.

1419
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:56,890
AmiAmi.

1420
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,870
I love private email.

1421
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:03,970
That's my business email.

1422
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:04,750
Stop.

1423
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:05,910
I told you don't look.

1424
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,370
Wait, what is in here?

1425
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:09,450
Amazon...

1426
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:10,710
Why is that pinned?

1427
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:12,610
Untinned.

1428
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:13,590
I didn't put that there.

1429
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,790
Here, I'll even read it to you, okay?

1430
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:20,030
YouTube, private email, calendar, Twitter, X?

1431
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:21,670
Why are they two separate things?

1432
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:25,990
Google Drive, Studio, YouTube, and AmiAmi are my...

1433
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:27,810
All my recent things, okay?

1434
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,230
Oh wait, I'm not going to Twitter.

1435
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:31,070
I instinctually...

1436
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:32,450
I instinctually clicked Twitter.

1437
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:34,930
Okay, AmiAmi.

1438
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,590
Oh, my gosh!

1439
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:37,530
AmiAmi!

1440
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:40,350
Her figure is up for pre-order on here.

1441
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:43,610
Okay, I'll pre-order it.

1442
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:47,170
Okay, I'll pre-order it.

1443
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,390
Wait a second.

1444
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:50,710
Hold on, I want this.

1445
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:52,150
You guys, hold on.

1446
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:54,110
Wait.

1447
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:55,290
Okay, good.

1448
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:55,850
I'm not laughing.

1449
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:56,790
I want that.

1450
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:00,990
I want that.

1451
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,450
She's just licking the floor.

1452
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,140
Here, look at the AmiAmi one.

1453
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,080
It's kind of spicy.

1454
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,880
It's not even that expensive.

1455
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,060
It's actually a decent price.

1456
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,400
It's actually pretty...

1457
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,380
January 2025.

1458
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:32,490
Sensei.

1459
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:34,770
Sensei.

1460
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:36,070
Where are we?

1461
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:38,470
YouTube, don't flag me.

1462
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:39,490
This is art.

1463
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:40,590
It's artwork.

1464
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:42,470
Pre-order fun.

1465
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:43,050
Thank you.

1466
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:47,290
What else is on here?

1467
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:49,110
There's a REM.

1468
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:53,890
Birthday cake REM.

1469
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:54,830
Okay.

1470
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,070
I think I've seen that one before.

1471
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:57,310
Bye, bye, bye.

1472
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:58,790
Yen is at an all-time low.

1473
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:04,030
Still no snake though.

1474
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:06,050
I'm not sure.

1475
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:07,330
I don't see him at least.

1476
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:14,110
The price.

1477
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,190
Oh my god.

1478
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:18,770
It's so expensive.

1479
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:26,050
Look how cute her face is though.

1480
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:30,370
It's really cute.

1481
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,610
But I gotta figure.

1482
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:34,610
That's um...

1483
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,030
Hold on.

1484
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:36,490
Hold on, I'll show you.

1485
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:41,830
Let's see if I can find it even.

1486
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:45,910
I wanted these two ones also.

1487
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:47,310
This one.

1488
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:51,130
I love how soft her hair looks.

1489
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,190
And it's not a bad price.

1490
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:55,450
Kana is the genius child who licks baking soda.

1491
01:10:56,530 --> 01:11:01,370
What is your special... I can't even read that word.

1492
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:05,870
I'm the genius ghost who...

1493
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,260
Who's always busting!

1494
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:16,660
Yeah!

1495
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,600
I'm the genius ghost who's always busting.

1496
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,620
Let's see.

1497
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,080
That was like some time ago.

1498
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,920
They released so much Yudokan merch.

1499
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,320
Sorry that it's all kind of cut off.

1500
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:42,560
I don't feel like resizing.

1501
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:47,560
I like how this is just delved into AmiAmi's stream.

1502
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:47,660
Sorry.

1503
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,820
It wasn't this long ago though.

1504
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:52,500
I don't think.

1505
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:57,180
Does that mean the order date is coming up?

1506
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,220
It wasn't that long ago.

1507
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,440
I just want to get the figure.

1508
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,060
I just want the new Figma.

1509
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,900
The new snake Figma.

1510
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,720
Where is my figure that I ordered?

1511
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,160
No Metal Gear merch?

1512
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:14,940
I wonder actually.

1513
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:16,780
Metal Gear...

1514
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,000
You can see what I searched for before.

1515
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,050
Get out of here.

1516
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:27,270
Get out of here.

1517
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:31,980
Oh my god.

1518
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:33,120
Pekora.

1519
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:33,500
Stop!

1520
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:34,540
Don't call me out!

1521
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:36,720
Get

1522
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,080
out of the Metal Gear menu, you guys.

1523
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,020
Oh, there we go.

1524
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:44,240
Okay.

1525
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,420
It's all old stuff though.

1526
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:52,220
I think this is like the only thing that you probably would be able to get.

1527
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:53,140
Because... yeah.

1528
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,540
They re-released it.

1529
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,920
I feel like I'm being exposed in so many ways.

1530
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:08,000
This is why I never window... or never...

1531
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,420
Yeah, this is why I never show my windows.

1532
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,780
I don't know.

1533
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,400
I want...

1534
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:24,500
Let's see.

1535
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,700
I got one recently.

1536
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:29,380
But it was second hand.

1537
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:32,720
Let me see.

1538
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:33,700
I think they have...

1539
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,640
They should have it on here.

1540
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:37,860
This.

1541
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,180
I got this one.

1542
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:41,640
Oh, no.

1543
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,240
Just kidding.

1544
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:42,820
Sorry.

1545
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,300
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

1546
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:44,800
No.

1547
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,500
This one.

1548
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:49,440
I got the Peace Walker...

1549
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:51,380
Play...

1550
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,400
Play Arts...

1551
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,340
Figure.

1552
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:56,820
So...

1553
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:59,800
I got that second hand recently.

1554
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:03,880
And I got the figure of Snake with the fat ass.

1555
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,100
I'm so excited for that one.

1556
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,840
Oh my gosh.

1557
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:08,800
Look at him.

1558
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,600
I need him.

1559
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,040
I need this man.

1560
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,880
Look at them standing next to each other.

1561
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,600
Oh my God.

1562
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,540
His glasses.

1563
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,800
Look at him posing.

1564
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,940
I need this guy.

1565
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,440
Why doesn't he come with a hamburger?

1566
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,260
The mask is a little kinky though.

1567
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,480
I think.

1568
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,780
I think the mask is a little...

1569
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:50,220
Wow.

1570
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,240
Why do the aviators look like poop?

1571
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,200
What are you talking about?

1572
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,960
They don't at all.

1573
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:01,600
Also, I love...

1574
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,260
You guys can't see it but I'm going to click on this.

1575
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,120
And you're gonna be like, why was this under Metal Gear?

1576
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,440
Like I know why.

1577
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,480
Because of the title of the figure.

1578
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,040
But it's also very funny.

1579
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,310
It's because it's Symphogear.

1580
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:24,550
And then the bunny suit is metallic red.

1581
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:27,530
So it's under Metal Gear.

1582
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:30,830
I don't remember her.

1583
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:32,950
Oh, I have this Raiden.

1584
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:36,110
I found him at a secondhand store before once.

1585
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:37,010
In Japan.

1586
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:40,850
I have this.

1587
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:41,930
The...

1588
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:45,310
I bought it from here actually.

1589
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:47,570
I wanted the AmiAmi pass case.

1590
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:49,850
So I have that.

1591
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:54,970
Blame Otacon.

1592
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:56,110
Yeah.

1593
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:00,090
These are such good...

1594
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:00,670
Like...

1595
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:02,870
This is a really expensive one.

1596
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:06,070
But these other figure prices are pretty decent.

1597
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:07,700
Well, this one is expensive too but...

1598
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:12,630
I have...

1599
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:15,530
This one took me forever to find.

1600
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:16,730
Symphogear Mansion.

1601
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:19,630
This took me forever to find.

1602
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:21,590
And I didn't want it in the black version.

1603
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:23,250
I wanted it in the original version.

1604
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:25,130
But I own this.

1605
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:25,630
And...

1606
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:29,910
Mine didn't come with stickers.

1607
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:31,630
No.

1608
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:33,450
I've been ripped off.

1609
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:34,730
What?

1610
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:37,770
Mine didn't come with stickers.

1611
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:42,890
I've been robbed.

1612
01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:47,390
But it's...

1613
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:48,910
I didn't want the one in black.

1614
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:50,410
I wanted it in...

1615
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:52,030
Oh my god.

1616
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:52,650
Sorry.

1617
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:54,890
I just opened up my phone because I was checking a notification.

1618
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,090
But I was listening to...

1619
01:16:58,690 --> 01:16:59,130
TikTok.

1620
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,150
I don't know if you heard it.

1621
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:02,530
Mine didn't have stickers.

1622
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:06,090
But also, I don't even see the stickers applied onto here.

1623
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:07,790
So, what's the point?

1624
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:11,750
Art book.

1625
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:17,680
D-dog.

1626
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:21,700
Guilty Gear.

1627
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,440
Only hurt a little.

1628
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:26,780
Okay.

1629
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:27,480
Yeah, yeah.

1630
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,280
This is the one I got.

1631
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,560
Look how...

1632
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:32,180
I had to get...

1633
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:32,580
The...

1634
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:34,100
Well, not the only reason.

1635
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:37,320
But the biggest reason I wanted it was because of these guys.

1636
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,800
I needed the tiny...

1637
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,260
Look at his abs.

1638
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,660
They're so small.

1639
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,760
I had to have them.

1640
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:58,420
And look how cute Rex is.

1641
01:17:58,660 --> 01:17:59,300
Oh my gosh.

1642
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:00,620
It's one of...

1643
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,360
I think it's one of the favorite things I own.

1644
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,900
I wonder if they have...

1645
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:03,940
A...

1646
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,140
Oh, wow.

1647
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:08,920
There's a Metal Gear Solid 3D...

1648
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,420
Wait, what's this?

1649
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:13,960
Oh, God.

1650
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,640
What is this?

1651
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,900
This is so, so sad.

1652
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:23,980
What is this?

1653
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,100
Who are you?

1654
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,790
Why is Chico in there?

1655
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:37,850
This is...

1656
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:39,530
At least they didn't put pause, right?

1657
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:41,370
Because that would be even more depressing.

1658
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:42,390
But God...

1659
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:46,550
His face here looks so funny.

1660
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:48,570
Oh, gosh.

1661
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:49,950
Whoo.

1662
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:51,130
I want the...

1663
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:52,870
I want the skull face, kind of.

1664
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:54,930
Wait, no.

1665
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:55,450
That...

1666
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:55,990
I did not...

1667
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:58,270
I did not just see a cage.

1668
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:59,930
I did not just see a cage.

1669
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:01,190
I did not just see...

1670
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:01,450
Ah!

1671
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:17,810
This is...

1672
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:17,970
This is...

1673
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:18,390
This is...

1674
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:19,410
This is...

1675
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:28,530
This is so...

1676
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:32,570
Oh, my God.

1677
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:33,730
He's going after that guy.

1678
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:35,430
This is kind of fun.

1679
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:36,750
I like this a lot, actually.

1680
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:38,150
I wonder if it comes with all of this.

1681
01:19:38,330 --> 01:19:38,950
This is...

1682
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:39,890
This is wild.

1683
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:44,890
Oh, my God.

1684
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:45,490
I'm crying.

1685
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:46,990
This is so funny.

1686
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:48,970
They know what they were doing.

1687
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:52,310
Oh, my gosh.

1688
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:55,150
I kind of want it so I can put everybody in the cage.

1689
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,750
Oh, my God.

1690
01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:01,090
I want everybody in the baby jail.

1691
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:03,910
Oh, my God.

1692
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:06,590
I wish it was still for sale.

1693
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:09,730
Oh, send me back.

1694
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:10,230
When does...

1695
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:10,910
When was this released?

1696
01:20:10,970 --> 01:20:11,310
2015.

1697
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:12,570
Send me back.

1698
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,030
Oh, this is so...

1699
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:17,490
This whole set is...

1700
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:18,210
Wow.

1701
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:21,950
That's my favorite thing.

1702
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:25,690
Put chat in the cage.

1703
01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:26,350
Oh, I will.

1704
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:28,490
Oh, here we go.

1705
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:30,650
It's tiny.

1706
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:34,650
Why is the picture so small?

1707
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:43,710
ChicoChildSoldierPOWVersionChangeCageAndTraumaIncludedPiesStomachBombed.

1708
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:44,530
Oh, my God.

1709
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:48,170
It's so small.

1710
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:50,930
We're getting into, like, the non-metal gear stuff.

1711
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:51,930
Oh, my God.

1712
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,130
Oh, Peace Walker.

1713
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:54,050
It's so small.

1714
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:00,660
More Symphogear.

1715
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:02,040
I like...

1716
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,300
They came out with these cases.

1717
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:09,680
They had, like, an iDroid case, but they also came out with these, like, actual metal cases.

1718
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:16,140
And I want to get the iDroid one because I see it pretty often for sale.

1719
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,380
Imagine a friend enters your room and asks you, why do you have a scale model of a kid in a cage?

1720
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,220
I know, right?

1721
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:24,720
Oh, my God.

1722
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,480
But, yeah, I don't have any...

1723
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,960
I can't justify getting them because I would have to...

1724
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,540
I would never be able to use them.

1725
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,260
But the iDroid one is so cool.

1726
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:34,140
I was like...

1727
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,360
If I...

1728
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,100
I don't know.

1729
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,060
Mod it or something.

1730
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:39,800
There's no way.

1731
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:40,500
There's no way.

1732
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:42,360
So much Symphogear.

1733
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:48,480
What is Metal Fear?

1734
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,580
Metal Fear Notebook.

1735
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:54,700
I don't know.

1736
01:21:59,140 --> 01:21:59,620
I don't know.

1737
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,660
Do you guys want to see my recently viewed items?

1738
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,440
They're at the bottom.

1739
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,460
Look at this creepy...

1740
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:17,790
Carby.

1741
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:19,110
Yeah.

1742
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:22,760
Car...

1743
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,480
What is this, though?

1744
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,340
It says, Metal Gear Notebook 2012 top features.

1745
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,240
Four snakes and personal data and Metal Gear appearing in the title.

1746
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:31,420
What does that mean?

1747
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,900
Different famous quotes of characters are printed for each day.

1748
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,440
Is it just a calendar?

1749
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,500
A 2012 calendar?

1750
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:41,420
Seven title stories are summarized.

1751
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,760
Many screenshots are used.

1752
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:47,140
Worlds of Metal Gear can be enjoyed with gaming language.

1753
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:49,440
Oh, I love gaming language.

1754
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:51,140
I see you ogling, Ayami.

1755
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,700
I'm going to get that.

1756
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:56,840
I'm going to get that, Ayami figure.

1757
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:00,200
Okay.

1758
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:02,540
Last page.

1759
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,300
It's all...

1760
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,360
It's all Peace Walker.

1761
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:09,060
Oh, wait.

1762
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:09,400
What are these?

1763
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:10,440
Oh, wait.

1764
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,180
I've seen these before.

1765
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,940
Yeah, the ultra detail ones.

1766
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,240
They look really good, actually.

1767
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:22,780
I do really like these because they have all snakes except Liquid and Solidus.

1768
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:25,840
But, you know.

1769
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,860
They'd rather...

1770
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:33,920
They'd rather put a mask over Old Snake than include Liquid in there.

1771
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:40,940
I would kill for MGS4 figures.

1772
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:45,440
These ones you can find occasionally on Mercari.

1773
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,580
Yeah, the playable snakes.

1774
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:50,260
There you go.

1775
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,380
Yeah, the playable snakes.

1776
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:54,180
That's a better way to put it.

1777
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:54,320
What?

1778
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:56,020
They also don't have MGS1 snakes.

1779
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,120
Thank you, Mint.

1780
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,460
I'm going to pre-order that BAU.

1781
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:01,520
It's good, right?

1782
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:03,660
It's good, right?

1783
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,000
Oh, sorry.

1784
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:09,360
I instinctively... There's a shiroko and a hoshinoa, so...

1785
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,460
Oh, wait.

1786
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,620
Is Yuka not up for pre-order?

1787
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:17,200
Oh, she is.

1788
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:17,400
Okay.

1789
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,660
I was like, why aren't you... Oh, wow.

1790
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:19,780
There's even more down here.

1791
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:22,860
They're really cute.

1792
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,780
They're really, really cute.

1793
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:25,480
I'm kind of debating.

1794
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,040
Sudden blue archive.

1795
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,220
Okay.

1796
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,780
Always blue archive.

1797
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:36,600
Look.

1798
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:37,560
You guys...

1799
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:40,200
When will they invent squishable figures?

1800
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,080
Actually, they have.

1801
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,100
I have a figure that has...

1802
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:44,660
It's cast off.

1803
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,180
It's smaller, but the boobs are squishy.

1804
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:51,300
So why won't they make the tummy squishy too?

1805
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,800
Come on.

1806
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:56,940
Pop-up parade.

1807
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,730
The formable materials are harder to cast.

1808
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:08,210
It's 2024.

1809
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:11,570
We have to make use of all of our technology.

1810
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:15,970
Is that Big Boss?

1811
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:20,630
Cheerleader Hibiki.

1812
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:23,150
So cute.

1813
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:24,130
Oh my god.

1814
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:28,910
I want to pre-order it.

1815
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,010
I'm still deciding if I should or not.

1816
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:35,210
Trying to cut down a little bit.

1817
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:36,990
I really like this toki also.

1818
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:37,810
Or rather...

1819
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:39,830
I want this toki.

1820
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:42,950
But I don't know if I like her face.

1821
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:45,190
There's something about it that doesn't...

1822
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:47,350
There's something off about it.

1823
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:48,510
Especially in this photo.

1824
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:49,750
I don't know.

1825
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:51,810
There's something off about her face.

1826
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:57,980
Not smug enough?

1827
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,680
No, toki is not a smug character.

1828
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:02,600
I got a figure with squishy thighs.

1829
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:03,320
There is hope.

1830
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,780
Sounds like an idea for future merch.

1831
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,720
Squishable Minto figure.

1832
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:14,920
Where would I be squishable at?

1833
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,780
Actually don't answer that.

1834
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,780
I don't want...

1835
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,380
Don't answer that.

1836
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,760
Like she looks better in some...

1837
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,380
Like this picture she looks good I think.

1838
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,200
I don't know.

1839
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,540
I think the face is just a little off for me though.

1840
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:38,860
Okay.

1841
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:39,640
We're done.

1842
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,040
I'm done window shopping.

1843
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,360
Time for real shopping.

1844
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:03,860
Well guys, this was fun.

1845
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:06,600
Thanks for letting me...

1846
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:07,680
Watch that.

1847
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:10,080
Thanks for watching it all together.

1848
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:10,820
Oh, hold on.

1849
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,140
I have to put up my advertisements.

1850
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:12,900
I'm so sorry.

1851
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:14,600
Advertisements!

1852
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,440
Oh wait, there's supposed to be...

1853
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,400
Behind me.

1854
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:23,620
There we go.

1855
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,460
Squishy mint figure.

1856
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,340
I guess like maybe ectoplasm, right?

1857
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,400
The mint stream.

1858
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:34,400
The rare place where...

1859
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,920
In the same sitting you view merch of military...

1860
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,200
What are you talking about?

1861
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:40,760
We didn't look at any...

1862
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,080
Anything that was 18+.

1863
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:49,740
Maybe...

1864
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:52,120
Maybe some stream will...

1865
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:54,220
Will...

1866
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:56,020
Will...

1867
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:57,120
Uh...

1868
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,340
Shop AmiAmi or something.

1869
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,760
We can do something like that.

1870
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:03,760
If you guys would be...

1871
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,000
Not shop, but window shop.

1872
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,700
If you guys would be interested.

1873
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:09,180
Maybe something like that.

1874
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:12,900
Anyway.

1875
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,000
Thank you guys for letting me fan out...

1876
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:15,780
Fan out?

1877
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,620
I'm all fanned out.

1878
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:22,400
Fan girl out a little bit.

1879
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,820
And also window shop.

1880
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:26,680
While I was looking for...

1881
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:29,740
Snake on AmiAmi.

1882
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:30,520
But he was not there.

1883
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,000
So sad.

1884
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:34,700
Tomorrow we'll be playing more Metal Gear.

1885
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,000
So...

1886
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:37,940
If you were just like wow.

1887
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,940
Not enough Metal Gear today Minto.

1888
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,840
Well then you...

1889
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,520
Can check us out tomorrow.

1890
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,760
I just finished air combat.

1891
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:47,520
About Ace Combat 1.

1892
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:48,640
It was a pain experience.

1893
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:51,580
You did it though.

1894
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,180
Nice shirt nerd.

1895
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,040
Thank you.

1896
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:56,720
Thank you.

1897
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:58,700
Even though I got scammed.

1898
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,380
If you don't know what I mean.

1899
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,180
Watch the beginning of the stream.

1900
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:03,120
But yeah.

1901
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:06,040
See you guys tomorrow.

1902
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,420
Get some rest.

1903
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:08,540
It's the weekend baby.

1904
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:09,580
It's the weekend party.

1905
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:14,400
Bye bye.

1906
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,480
Thank you.

1907
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,000
Thank you.

1908
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,080
Bye bye.

1909
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:20,410
You have face change.

1910
01:30:20,810 --> 01:30:22,130
Face changes though.

1911
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:23,490
I will get last.

1912
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:26,010
Okay everybody let Evan have last.

1913
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:32,090
Can you blame me though?

1914
01:30:32,150 --> 01:30:32,950
Looking for Free Rin.

1915
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:36,950
They have like the new plushie.

1916
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:38,790
But I don't like Free Rin's eyes.

1917
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:39,990
On the plushie.

1918
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:40,950
So I don't think I...

1919
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:44,770
They have the one where she's in the mimic.

1920
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:47,690
But I don't like the eyes on the plushie.

1921
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:48,170
It's self.

1922
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:49,590
I did it.

1923
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:50,790
It makes me so sad.

1924
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:56,760
I think I pre-ordered a figure.

1925
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:10,710
That is really cute.

1926
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:13,590
I just wish her eyes were different in the plushie.

1927
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:17,870
Goofy but not in a good way.

1928
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:19,490
Oh wow.
