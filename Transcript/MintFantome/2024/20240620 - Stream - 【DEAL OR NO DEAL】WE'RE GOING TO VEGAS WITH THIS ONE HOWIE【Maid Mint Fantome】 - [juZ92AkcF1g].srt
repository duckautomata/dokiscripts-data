00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,980
Babycore, thanks for the gift dude!

2
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,960
Hello everybody!

3
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,020
Hold on, I gotta turn on my fan.

4
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,020
It's kinda hot in here.

5
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,460
It's hot because I'm ready to make... Oh no, wait.

6
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,380
Hold on, I forgot something.

7
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,920
Some hot deal!

8
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,760
I had my glasses on the whole time.

9
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,220
I thought that I forgot.

10
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,570
Whoopsie.

11
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,150
I thought I forgot my glasses.

12
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,410
But I had them on my head the whole time.

13
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,770
Anyway, I am so sick of listening to this music.

14
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,910
Hold on, Babycore, thank you for the 5 more gifted.

15
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,630
Thank you!

16
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,530
Arisa, thanks for the super chat.

17
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,470
And I saw someone else.

18
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,750
I think it was you, Sprank.

19
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,530
Am I right?

20
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,290
Oh my gosh.

21
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,290
Yes!

22
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,330
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

23
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:21,850
Thank you so much!

24
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,710
I recognize your cat.

25
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,350
Bald or no bald?

26
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,170
Gosh, there we go.

27
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,450
Start.

28
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:30,930
Start.

29
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,990
Start.

30
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,470
Bald, of course.

31
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,950
That's how Howie would want it.

32
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,150
Right, Mr. Mando?

33
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,010
Yeah.

34
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,990
I know I'm kinda big right now, but don't worry, I'll get smaller.

35
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,410
Andricos, thanks for the time gift dude!

36
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,770
Are you ready for some of the most disturbing models in the history of Wii shovelware?

37
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,830
Molotov by Iron Shepherd Wii?

38
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,770
Okay, so I have seen...

39
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,930
Because I tested this.

40
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,790
Hello?

41
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:04,970
I have seen the very soulless, scary models that stand in the background of this game.

42
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,350
It's quite something to view.

43
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,070
I am so ready.

44
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,850
Oh my god, I am so ready to make some money, baby!

45
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,970
I'm so ready!

46
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,410
Or lose all my money.

47
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:21,930
Who knows?

48
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,230
I actually don't know how this game works.

49
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,910
Deal... or no deal.

50
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,130
So, look at this.

51
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,210
Also, this has like custom games, so I think you can rig it.

52
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,110
Play a game of Deal or No Deal with custom settings of your choosing.

53
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,290
You can rig the game!

54
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,710
Game on!

55
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,810
Can I get a happy birthday?

56
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,170
For...

57
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,370
Garfield.

58
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,250
Garfield.

59
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,490
Garfield.

60
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,630
This is Garfield's birthday today, you guys.

61
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,590
This is why we are playing Deal or No Deal.

62
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,310
Look, there's challenges.

63
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,790
Series of games with specific goals that test your luck, skill, and endurance.

64
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,130
Mini-games that are fast and fun.

65
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,890
You can play against the computer or some friends.

66
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,630
And extras.

67
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,250
Oh, oh, never mind.

68
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,370
Extras is nothing.

69
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,490
It's just the credits.

70
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,250
Why would you put it under extras then?

71
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,850
What's under the mini-games?

72
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,570
Push your luck.

73
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,670
Play a game of chance to win some fast cash.

74
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,070
Sharp shooter.

75
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,970
Test your shooting skills in this fun game.

76
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:51,430
FBA.

77
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,250
Blackjack!

78
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,790
They have Blackjack.

79
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,750
Try your hand at good old 21.

80
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,390
Deal or No Deal style.

81
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,010
Literally eating veggies lasagna.

82
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,690
Gamble, gamble, marathon.

83
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,710
Play all three mini-games in a row against friends or the AI.

84
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:12,850
GW.

85
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,210
And leaderboard.

86
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,030
We'll try these later, right?

87
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,430
Minto, you ready to see those hot babes?

88
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,830
Oh, you know it.

89
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,190
Oh my gosh.

90
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,110
I'm so ready.

91
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,330
I'm so ready to see some hot babes.

92
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,430
All in on Minto.

93
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,850
Okay.

94
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,370
TV show style though.

95
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,190
Okay, so...

96
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:45,010
I don't know Deal or No Deal that well.

97
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,130
I think it's... okay.

98
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,470
You open up some boxes.

99
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,290
And they have money inside.

100
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,270
And then there's a banker guy who's like, I'm gonna offer you some money.

101
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,410
I think.

102
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,390
Or something.

103
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,810
I don't actually quite know.

104
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,250
You pick a box and hope it's a big number.

105
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,410
No, don't you hope it's a small number?

106
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,730
Aren't you trying to eliminate the small numbers and then you get the big numbers from the bank?

107
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,930
Can I buy a vowel?

108
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,710
Oh, I have a Mii that I created.

109
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,550
I wonder if you can tell.

110
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,390
Which one is mine.

111
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,410
Which one is mine.

112
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:55,750
Okay.

113
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,010
If you delete this Mii from the Mii Channel, you will not delete this profile.

114
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,750
You will be assigned a default character.

115
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,170
Cool.

116
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,050
I also...

117
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,990
It's really hard to move on this... on the Wii.

118
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,210
I kind of got his name wrong.

119
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,030
So...

120
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,950
I have really shaky hands.

121
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,150
I was trying to write it out.

122
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,290
Hopefully that doesn't mess me up in this... in the future.

123
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:33,930
Play a game of Deal or No Deal where you're trying to pick the case with the million dollars or walk out with as much money as possible.

124
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,670
Play it over a series of rounds.

125
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,810
Remove cases...

126
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,230
Oh, it totally explains it.

127
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,690
Remove cases until the banker makes an offer for your case.

128
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,630
Accept the offer and go home.

129
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,610
Or keep playing to try and win even more.

130
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,010
Special events such as the Million Dollar Mission can help you win even more money.

131
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,830
So have some fun trying to beat the banker.

132
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,730
We're gonna beat his butt.

133
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,990
The sad thing is that the eyebrows are not united.

134
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,570
It wouldn't let me if I tried.

135
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,790
I tried.

136
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,430
It's knowledge snared.

137
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,710
Howie!

138
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,210
Welcome to Deal or No Deal.

139
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,350
I'm Howie Mandel.

140
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,310
Ladies, please.

141
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,410
Where did the music go?

142
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,650
Ladies, please.

143
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,430
Oh my God, here they come.

144
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,170
Wow!

145
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,510
Holy mo...

146
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,890
Oh, wow.

147
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,280
Oh, God.

148
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,980
Not a single one of them is blinking.

149
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:32,860
Oh, God.

150
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,900
Oh, God.

151
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,560
Ladies, please.

152
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,960
Ladies, please back up.

153
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,100
Oh, God.

154
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,540
So scarily.

155
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,440
Hello, ladies.

156
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,140
Hi.

157
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,620
Hi, Howie.

158
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,420
Oh, I love that.

159
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,700
Please say hello to our next player.

160
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,470
Skinny Snake.

161
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,650
Hi, Howie.

162
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,290
We got 26 lovely ladies holding 26 cases.

163
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,870
Each of those cases is holding a random amount of money.

164
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,970
The soulless people in the background.

165
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:11,450
We don't know what's in what case.

166
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:17,010
But we do know one case is holding one million dollars.

167
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,610
Sorry if the audio is like so weird.

168
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,730
It's loud and then it's not loud.

169
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,490
Hi, Howie.

170
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:27,590
Howie.

171
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,030
Oh, take a vote.

172
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,770
I get to pick a case.

173
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,430
Okay, guys.

174
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,070
Time to pick a case.

175
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:43,390
Now in my brain, I'm thinking 4, 14, or 24.

176
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,790
But also, maybe we should pick it by how...

177
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,510
I mean, they're all really sexy, so it's hard to say, right?

178
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:52,730
Four?

179
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,930
Pick number four.

180
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,170
26.

181
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:57,570
26.

182
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,730
No, I think that's bad luck to pick the very last case, right?

183
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,090
Three.

184
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,770
Pick number three, my lord.

185
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:06,990
Four.

186
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:07,870
Okay.

187
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,810
A lot of people saying four.

188
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:09,770
Ten.

189
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,350
Oh, I'm nervous.

190
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,230
Okay.

191
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:12,910
I'm gonna go with four.

192
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,990
I'm gonna go with my gut.

193
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,830
You.

194
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,110
Oh.

195
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:21,810
Kayla.

196
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,820
That's your case to keep, to take home, to spend, do whatever you want to do.

197
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,740
Do whatever you want, unless you should decide to sell it.

198
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,260
Let's find out if you got a million dollars in there.

199
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:36,480
You ready?

200
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,640
Let's start by opening up six cases.

201
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,240
Five gifted.

202
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:40,760
Okay.

203
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,780
So we're opening six cases.

204
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,040
All right.

205
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,980
What's our first case?

206
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,120
I can't believe we got Kayla.

207
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,860
Happy Pride, everybody.

208
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,320
Oh my goodness.

209
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
What could be the first case we go with?

210
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,780
This girl kind of looks like me though, right?

211
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,120
Maybe I should start with her.

212
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,420
I got to knock out.

213
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,920
I got to knock her out.

214
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,400
She kind of looks like me.

215
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:01,800
I got to knock her out.

216
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,040
Kayla and Icon.

217
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,620
Did her parents hate her?

218
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,340
12?

219
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:07,880
Okay.

220
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,380
I see someone said 12.

221
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:09,960
Where is 12?

222
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,120
Right here.

223
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,460
I'm taking number 12 out.

224
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,660
Why is Snake looking...

225
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,640
Open the case.

226
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,500
Open the case.

227
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,040
Oh no.

228
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,840
Why are you cheering?

229
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,600
That's a lot of money.

230
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,570
Oh.

231
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:34,950
Okay.

232
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,270
You have to open up five more cases.

233
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,890
Okay, five more cases, guys.

234
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,110
But it's not a million.

235
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,810
Okay, we want the million to be in number four, the one that we grabbed.

236
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,790
Right?

237
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,970
I love the dance.

238
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,730
Oh my gosh, you guys, I'm nervous.

239
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:50,250
22.

240
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,870
I don't know about you.

241
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,170
I'm feeling 22.

242
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:55,690
Yeah.

243
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,050
Open the case.

244
00:13:59,310 --> 00:13:59,790
Open the case.

245
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,210
Five dollars!

246
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,720
Happy!

247
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,120
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

248
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,100
The audience, everything.

249
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,900
I think, I feel like we are literally in the Twilight Zone right now.

250
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,240
Him silently jumping.

251
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,880
Okay, guys, next one.

252
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,060
It's gotta be seven?

253
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,920
I'm thinking 16!

254
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,300
I don't know!

255
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,160
I'm gonna take out 16.

256
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,940
Okay, hold on, I lost the Wii.

257
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:35,960
Hold on.

258
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,740
Oh, there it is.

259
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay.

260
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,780
16.

261
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,520
I'm taking out 16.

262
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,960
If I can press it.

263
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,200
Okay.

264
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,260
Okay.

265
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,880
Go with your gut.

266
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,340
Melanie!

267
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,940
Please, open the case.

268
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,840
Open the case.

269
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,320
Oh!

270
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,660
Oh!

271
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,740
Not bad.

272
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,620
It could be worse.

273
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,940
Okay, three cases left, though.

274
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,980
Three cases left, you guys.

275
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,880
Okay, come on.

276
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,360
Seven?

277
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,800
Seven!

278
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,880
I saw seven first.

279
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,740
I'm gonna go with seven.

280
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,040
Come on, come on.

281
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,840
That's bad.

282
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,700
No, it's fine.

283
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,560
If seven is even higher, I'm gonna scream.

284
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,860
Twenty-five!

285
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,840
Yippee!

286
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,160
Do a dance, Snake.

287
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,780
Oh, never mind.

288
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,480
Just gonna stand there.

289
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,340
A heretic!

290
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,900
Happy birthday!

291
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,220
Two cases left open.

292
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,660
Two?

293
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,740
Who is breathing?

294
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,490
Do you guys hear someone breathing?

295
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,550
They're like...

296
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,010
Ten?

297
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:50,730
Thirteen?

298
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,370
I see ten.

299
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,790
Ten is one of the ones that you guys wanted me to pick, so...

300
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,870
Something very uncanny about this.

301
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,850
Open the case.

302
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,710
Open the case.

303
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,250
Snake, you gotta look in the direction.

304
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,150
One cent!

305
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,470
You guys wanted me to pick this fucking box!

306
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,230
Are you kidding me?

307
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,190
You guys were trying to jinx me!

308
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,610
It's literally the lowest number!

309
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,020
You guys wanted me to go home with nothing!

310
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,460
Okay, last case, you guys.

311
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,100
Last case.

312
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,570
Nineteen!

313
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,410
She's cute.

314
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,970
I promise you the answer is eighteen.

315
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,050
Oh, sorry, Michi.

316
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,230
She's cute, though.

317
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,790
Wait, what was her name?

318
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,690
Jian!

319
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,350
Five thousand?

320
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,650
They're happy about that.

321
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,130
The crowd is pleased.

322
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,850
They will not eat us yet.

323
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,270
Okay, what's happening now?

324
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,170
Not too bad.

325
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,870
There's a man in this room with just one job.

326
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,150
And it's a nasty job.

327
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,170
And his job is to get you out of here for as little as possible.

328
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,270
Why is Howie so small?

329
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,290
He's looking at the board, he's looking at you, and he wants to buy that case for as little as possible.

330
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,350
He's working it out.

331
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,370
That's the banker right there.

332
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:07,710
The banker?

333
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,910
He's gonna call me and make you an offer right now.

334
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,570
I see him up there.

335
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,270
What do you think is gonna happen?

336
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,290
I don't know!

337
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,130
I don't know, Howie!

338
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:15,610
I don't know!

339
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,030
I don't know!

340
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:16,430
I don't know!

341
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,050
Hello.

342
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:17,610
Hello.

343
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,270
Okay.

344
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:18,810
Yeah?

345
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,670
What's the offer?

346
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,230
Right.

347
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,150
He looks like the...

348
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,830
Right.

349
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,990
Villain and Detective Conan.

350
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,510
The new offer?

351
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:28,810
Oh!

352
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,410
63,000!

353
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,830
Deal or no deal?

354
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,070
Oh!

355
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,050
He said the thing!

356
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:35,970
He said the thing!

357
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,290
Deal... or no deal?

358
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,190
I think no deal.

359
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,430
That's a terrible offer.

360
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,750
Terrible offer.

361
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,850
They're only allowed to blink once they open a case.

362
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,690
Till then, only constant solo stares.

363
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,410
Deal or no deal?

364
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:51,630
No deal.

365
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,590
No deal!

366
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,850
I believe in my case.

367
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,290
He's pondering.

368
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,110
He doesn't know what to do.

369
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,010
No deal!

370
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,290
No deal!

371
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,450
No deal!

372
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,490
I was gonna say nobody cared about that, I guess.

373
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,870
Five cases to open.

374
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,990
Why does this sound like I'm in a serial killer?

375
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,550
Like...

376
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,550
It sounds like I'm in a thriller show.

377
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,130
Okay, um, I know Michi said 18, so I'm gonna go with that.

378
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,990
I'm seeing some people say one.

379
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,010
I'll go with that next.

380
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,190
18?

381
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,530
Michelle?

382
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,530
Open the case.

383
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,150
Don't let me down.

384
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,910
$50!

385
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,250
Nice, nice, nice!

386
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,000
Nice, nice, nice!

387
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,920
Okay.

388
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,260
Four cases.

389
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,260
Four cases.

390
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,240
I'm gonna go with one.

391
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,660
Numero uno, everybody.

392
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,200
Numero uno.

393
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,260
If I can click it.

394
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,180
You.

395
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,180
Open the case.

396
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:00,840
Open the case.

397
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,180
Okay!

398
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,660
$10,000.

399
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,680
That's like... that's like...

400
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,620
That's less than what was our offer, though.

401
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,800
So we're still okay, I think.

402
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,120
Right?

403
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,060
Not bad.

404
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,540
It's okay.

405
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,540
It's okay.

406
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,740
We're trying to get the left column.

407
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,260
Okay, three cases left open.

408
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,640
You guys, I'm sweating so bad.

409
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,260
Oh, my God.

410
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,920
You're me trying to win an Oscar or something.

411
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,480
Five?

412
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,600
Okay, I'm seeing five.

413
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,720
Unlucky.

414
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,420
Who is breathing?

415
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,600
Open the case.

416
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,240
Open the case.

417
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,800
Oh, my God.

418
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,180
No!

419
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,400
Five was bad!

420
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,260
Camille!

421
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,860
Oof.

422
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,520
Oof.

423
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,260
Not good.

424
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,760
Not good.

425
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,420
Two cases left open.

426
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:57,920
Okay.

427
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,020
Eight.

428
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,860
Twenty-three.

429
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,000
We haven't got any up here, really.

430
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,700
Just a few.

431
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,960
Let's do twenty-three.

432
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,420
Twenty-three.

433
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,780
Okay.

434
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,680
I think I'm gonna save eleven for last.

435
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,200
She's just gonna stand in there in the middle.

436
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,520
Please, open the case.

437
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:15,840
Please.

438
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,520
Oh, my God.

439
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,300
Snake's like, come on.

440
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:17,980
Ugh!

441
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,080
Don't clap, everyone!

442
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,300
Teresa, no!

443
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:23,760
No!

444
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,130
No!

445
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,750
Oh, my God.

446
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,450
Oh, my God.

447
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,990
Oh, my God.

448
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,290
Oh, my God.

449
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,490
One more case.

450
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,470
One more case.

451
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,810
I think I'm gonna single out eleven as much as possible.

452
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,210
Let's go to seventeen, I think.

453
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,910
I'm gonna go to seventeen.

454
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,850
I'm trusting my gut.

455
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,570
Thirteen is totally a lucky number.

456
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,350
Okay, fine.

457
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,650
I'll get thirteen out of the way.

458
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,710
You guys tell me.

459
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,230
Tell me if it's good or not.

460
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,290
Tell me.

461
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,110
Open the case.

462
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,530
Tell me what the damage is.

463
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,590
Do I got it, Doc?

464
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,410
Is it terminal?

465
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,910
Is it terminal?

466
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,830
Ten dollars!

467
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,150
Yippee!

468
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,630
They're all, like, clapping in sync.

469
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,570
What do you think's gonna happen?

470
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,910
I don't know, Howie.

471
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,610
I don't know.

472
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,430
Hello.

473
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,090
Hello.

474
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,490
Okay.

475
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,710
Moshi moshi.

476
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,590
Really?

477
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,450
Really?

478
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:24,610
Okay.

479
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,190
What do you mean, really?

480
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,090
The people in the audience are so...

481
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,910
The offer did go.

482
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,810
It went up!

483
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,450
It went up!

484
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:32,990
It went up!

485
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,350
Deal or no deal?

486
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,850
You guys, this is pretty good.

487
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,970
Eighty-three thousand dollars.

488
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,970
That's pretty good.

489
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,570
No deal?

490
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,190
We want at least a hundred K.

491
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,850
You know what?

492
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,530
You're so right.

493
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:52,990
No deal!

494
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,730
Why is Howie the most realistic looking...

495
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,350
No deal!

496
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,410
No deal!

497
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,450
What if I have the one million?

498
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,690
Okay, four cases.

499
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,650
My lucky number.

500
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,130
For some reason, my eyes went to nine first.

501
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,170
Fourteen?

502
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,250
My lucky number?

503
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,150
My second lucky number?

504
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,910
Twenty-one?

505
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,150
Blackjack?

506
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,330
All or nothing?

507
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,830
Oh, gosh.

508
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,190
I don't know.

509
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,330
I don't know.

510
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:40,990
Twenty-one?

511
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:44,610
Hmm.

512
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,090
You.

513
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,090
Open the case.

514
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:48,890
Open the case.

515
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,310
Karen?

516
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:49,570
Karen?

517
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:54,970
Gosh,

518
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,860
we have so many, like, hundred, two hundred.

519
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,180
We have so many.

520
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,600
I'm not listening to you guys ever again.

521
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,300
I'm going with nine.

522
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:09,960
It's my gut.

523
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,720
It's my gut.

524
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,460
Baka baka.

525
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,000
Baka baka.

526
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,560
Baka baka.

527
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,420
Emily!

528
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,740
Please, open the case.

529
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,840
Emily, I believe in you.

530
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:20,980
Three hundred!

531
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,220
Nice.

532
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:23,740
Thank you.

533
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,140
Thank you.

534
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,240
Thank you.

535
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,920
The what with the goatee?

536
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,640
Two cases left over.

537
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,040
Also, Zachary, sorry I saw your stream live just now.

538
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,920
Thanks for getting the Minta Matara merch.

539
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,940
I love it.

540
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,060
Your standees are on my bookshelf.

541
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,440
I have a bag to carry my stuff walking home from work.

542
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:50,740
Yippee!

543
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,660
Thank you.

544
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,020
Twenty-six is free?

545
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,320
Okay.

546
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,560
I'm seeing several twenty-sixes.

547
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,720
Twenty-five.

548
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,800
I'm going to close my eyes and pick one.

549
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,460
I don't know which one I just did.

550
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,120
Twenty-five!

551
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,000
Open the case.

552
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:09,940
Oh!

553
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,020
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

554
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,100
Nice, nice, nice.

555
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,400
Okay.

556
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,960
Oh, my God.

557
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,900
Oh, my God.

558
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,660
Oh, my God.

559
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,340
One more case.

560
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,220
One more case.

561
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,580
Don't open twenty.

562
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,300
Why?

563
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,160
You're making me want to open.

564
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,160
Eleven is sus.

565
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,060
You know what?

566
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,120
I'm going to knock eleven out.

567
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,820
I'm going to get rid of this.

568
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,560
I'm going to get rid of this.

569
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,380
There's going to be a big old gap in the middle.

570
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,620
Get out of here, eleven.

571
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,720
Open the case.

572
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,440
Open the case.

573
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,260
It was sus in a bad way.

574
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,440
Here comes the offer.

575
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,080
Okay.

576
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,900
Here comes the offer.

577
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,540
Oh, God.

578
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:00,980
Oh, God.

579
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,200
Hello.

580
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,260
Let's see.

581
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,760
The Future Mints case has one dollar.

582
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,640
No, it doesn't.

583
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,460
Okay.

584
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,940
Freak Phantom.

585
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:11,800
A new offer?

586
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,480
Oh!

587
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,360
Close, but no cigar.

588
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,600
Deal or no deal?

589
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,380
Deal?

590
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,580
Take the deal, Mints.

591
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:22,760
No!

592
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,300
No!

593
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,280
It's not six figures yet.

594
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,840
It's so close.

595
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,740
But I'm going to have to pay taxes on that.

596
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,640
No deal.

597
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,060
Okay.

598
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,960
I believe in my case.

599
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,190
Why does he just...

600
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,770
He doesn't do anything.

601
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:43,570
Okay.

602
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,070
Three cases left.

603
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,910
Don't give Mints money?

604
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,830
Yes, sir.

605
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,330
Okay.

606
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:48,650
Okay.

607
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:48,990
Okay.

608
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,230
Okay.

609
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:49,410
Okay.

610
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,130
That banker looked like a boss, baby.

611
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,510
Three?

612
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,650
Pick number three, my lord.

613
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
I'm Shari K.

614
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,140
I'm Shari K.

615
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,160
I'm Shari K.

616
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,480
I'm Shari K.

617
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,020
I'm Shari K.

618
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,140
I'm Shari K.

619
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,360
Open the case.

620
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,800
Open the case.

621
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,680
Oh!

622
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:10,960
Okay.

623
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,660
Could be worse.

624
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,960
Oh gosh, there's a whole lot of blanked out numbers on the right side.

625
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,400
There's a whole lot of...

626
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,440
Two cases left open.

627
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,180
You guys!

628
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,480
I'm scared.

629
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,740
I was thinking eight.

630
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,720
Seven.

631
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,740
Eight.

632
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,060
Nine.

633
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,400
Eight.

634
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,640
Audra.

635
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,960
Don't let me down.

636
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,540
Audra.

637
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,020
Audra.

638
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,680
Audra!

639
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,500
Yes, Audra!

640
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,060
I was gonna say, you're too hot to let me down.

641
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,000
There's still one dollar up on the board.

642
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,380
Uh-oh.

643
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,920
But also one million dollars.

644
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,500
One case.

645
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,330
I can...

646
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,230
I feel the knife that Howie...

647
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,730
It's off screen, but he's like holding it up to my neck right now, you know?

648
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,010
Why are you guys trying to jinx me?

649
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,510
You're aiming to win a dollar, right?

650
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:14,830
Stop!

651
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,630
Oh my gosh.

652
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:23,570
Two...

653
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:23,770
Six?

654
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,610
Oh, six is down here in the corner.

655
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,690
Barely even...

656
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,530
It's just...

657
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,250
It's hiding away, you know?

658
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,230
Six!

659
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,270
Hannah.

660
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:43,930
Hannah.

661
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,390
Hannah.

662
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:44,850
Hannah.

663
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:45,470
Hannah.

664
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,510
I should have left you in the corner.

665
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,850
I should have left you in the corner.

666
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,390
Hannah, what are you doing to me?

667
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,220
Okay, Barn, thank you.

668
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,780
Remember an episode of the actual show where a guy's wife forced him to take the deal and then it turned out he had the million?

669
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,200
Hello.

670
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,180
Hello.

671
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:07,560
Oh, okay.

672
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,680
Oh, okay.

673
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,600
That doesn't sound good.

674
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,060
Oh.

675
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,760
It sounds bad.

676
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,440
It sounds bad.

677
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,580
The offer's gonna be so low.

678
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,540
It's gonna be so bad.

679
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,760
The offer did go.

680
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,800
It went up!

681
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,680
Oh, okay.

682
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,160
Deal or no deal?

683
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,820
Deal.

684
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:24,860
Deal.

685
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,000
You guys?

686
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,140
I wanna believe in my case.

687
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,160
I wanna believe in my case!

688
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,460
I want to believe in the four!

689
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,580
Believe in the four!

690
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,700
Believe in the four!

691
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,420
I want...

692
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:36,620
I...

693
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,160
You know what?

694
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,060
I think we have the one million.

695
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,460
We have the one million.

696
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,840
Deal.

697
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,180
Deal.

698
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:45,500
Deal.

699
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,740
No deal!

700
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,500
No deal!

701
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,420
No deal!

702
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,620
No deal!

703
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,840
No deal!

704
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,660
No deal!

705
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,900
There's still a million dollars!

706
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,320
Two cases left over.

707
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
Spitters, exactly.

708
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,080
You have the one dollar.

709
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,860
No I don't!

710
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,320
Twenty-four?

711
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,760
Twenty-six?

712
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,360
Twenty?

713
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,840
Let's go with twenty-six.

714
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,320
You over there, Elizabeth.

715
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,060
Nice!

716
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,280
Guys, we might win this.

717
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,120
One more case.

718
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,420
One more case.

719
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,640
Seventeen?

720
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,480
Fifteen?

721
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,240
Twenty-four?

722
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,340
I'm seeing a lot of fifteens.

723
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,260
You guys don't let me down.

724
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,220
Come on, snag the stairs.

725
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:03,880
Amy!

726
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,380
Please, open the case.

727
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,320
What is this angle?

728
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,320
Okay!

729
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,140
Okay!

730
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,120
Okay!

731
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,060
We're clapping.

732
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,880
We're stoic clapping.

733
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,300
We have three numbers on each side.

734
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,200
I think our offer is going to go up.

735
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,420
I think our offer is going to go up.

736
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,560
I think our offer is going to go up.

737
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:27,640
Hello.

738
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:28,800
Okay.

739
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,020
I'll tell him.

740
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,500
Okay.

741
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,040
Alright.

742
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,600
Love you too.

743
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:32,820
Okay.

744
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,920
A new offer?

745
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,000
It barely went up!

746
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,280
Deal or no deal?

747
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,440
Banker looking desperate.

748
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,940
You don't think he ever says that too?

749
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,420
Like, thanks mom.

750
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,620
This dream is going to turn my feathers white.

751
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,360
No deal.

752
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,440
No deal, you guys.

753
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:58,980
Come on.

754
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,480
I'm not a sucker.

755
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm no sucker.

756
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,520
No deal.

757
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,800
One more case.

758
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,480
Just one?

759
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,320
Seventeen.

760
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,760
Right smack dab in the middle.

761
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,880
Please, open the case.

762
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,480
Open the case.

763
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,820
You guys, I think we have a dollar.

764
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,420
You guys, I think we have just one dollar.

765
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,840
Oh my god.

766
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,360
Oh my god.

767
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:50,780
Oh my god.

768
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,720
Here comes the offer.

769
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,660
It's going to go up.

770
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,300
It's going to go up.

771
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,200
Look at these soulless people.

772
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,580
They're ready to eat my body.

773
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:56,800
Okay.

774
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,280
They're ready to bum rush the stage.

775
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:58,800
Okay.

776
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,300
They're ready to tear me limb from limb.

777
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,940
Especially that guy over there.

778
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,580
It went up.

779
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,920
It went up a hole.

780
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,380
Oh my god.

781
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,920
The banker is like literally molding the room.

782
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,580
The banker is cursing me out right now.

783
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,800
Oh my gosh, you guys.

784
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,120
I want to take it but I don't.

785
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,860
In real life, I would take that.

786
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,680
Yeah, but this is a video game.

787
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,800
Look at him.

788
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,420
I want to see him still be salty.

789
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,860
Get your dollar.

790
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,960
I think the person who said they were from the future's name.

791
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,300
No deal.

792
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,300
He's like, what's wrong with you?

793
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,840
What's wrong with you, Solid Sturge?

794
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,140
One case.

795
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,100
He's rage quitting.

796
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,960
24 or 2?

797
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,600
A lot of people saying 2.

798
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,360
A lot of people saying 24.

799
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,820
I'm going to go with 2.

800
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,630
I can't look.

801
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,250
Open the case.

802
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:31,850
I can't look.

803
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,440
Uh-oh.

804
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,640
Hey, banker.

805
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,000
Banker.

806
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,460
Banker.

807
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,320
Banker.

808
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:52,880
Banker.

809
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,580
We can talk this out.

810
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,600
Banker.

811
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:54,880
Okay.

812
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:55,960
Banker.

813
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:56,920
Okay.

814
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,200
He's laughing.

815
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:58,880
Okay.

816
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,900
He's laughing at me.

817
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,860
No way.

818
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,280
I went down.

819
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,540
There's no way I have the dollar.

820
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,500
Deal?

821
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,380
No deal.

822
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,340
I think I have the dollar.

823
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,460
It's fine.

824
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,540
It's fine.

825
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:18,820
It's fine.

826
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,620
It's fine.

827
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,780
I could have more than a dollar.

828
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,040
I could have 75 of them.

829
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:25,600
One more case.

830
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,760
I'm not going to listen to you guys.

831
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,660
What if your dollar is the dollar to surpass Metal Gear?

832
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,440
No deal.

833
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,680
14?

834
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,480
Okay.

835
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,880
We're going to go with 14, you guys.

836
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,480
Open the case.

837
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,860
Open the case.

838
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,600
We have the dollar.

839
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,880
There's no way we don't have the dollar.

840
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,960
Oh my gosh.

841
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,340
Oh my gosh.

842
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:01,740
Oh my gosh.

843
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,500
Here comes the offer.

844
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,380
Here comes the offer.

845
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,220
Hello.

846
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,280
Hello.

847
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,340
Okay.

848
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:08,780
Okay.

849
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,680
I'll let him know.

850
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,120
Okay.

851
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,120
Love you too.

852
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,620
Okay.

853
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,320
See you tonight.

854
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,220
The offer did go up.

855
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,000
Oh.

856
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:23,910
Or no deal.

857
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,010
He's rage quitting again.

858
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,710
Here's more money than what he's offering.

859
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,330
Okay.

860
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:32,790
I'll take it.

861
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,930
You guys, I'm not going to take it.

862
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,870
No deal.

863
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,570
No deal.

864
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,170
No deal.

865
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,950
No deal.

866
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:38,470
No deal.

867
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,790
No deal.

868
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:39,230
No deal.

869
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:39,410
No deal.

870
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:39,630
No deal.

871
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,190
No deal.

872
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,190
The leave and the four.

873
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,050
Show me one dollar.

874
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:51,510
We still have $750,000 on the table.

875
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,890
We still have it.

876
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,490
We still have it.

877
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,710
I'm going to get rid of 24 because her hair is too yellow.

878
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,330
You guys, look.

879
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,150
Actually, she's very beautiful.

880
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,570
I'm not making fun of you, Christy.

881
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,870
Please don't have $750,000.

882
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,490
Open the case.

883
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,550
Guys?

884
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,190
Guys?

885
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,050
It's a miracle.

886
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,310
It's a miracle.

887
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,930
Here comes the offer.

888
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:28,690
Hello.

889
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:29,870
Okay.

890
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,910
Okay.

891
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,230
Hello.

892
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:37,970
This guy is just like... he's about to... he's about to pounce on you.

893
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,230
Oh, my God.

894
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,330
If this was real life, I would be taking that.

895
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,870
Immediately, I would be taking that.

896
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,590
Oh, but it's not real life, you guys.

897
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,030
You guys.

898
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,390
You guys, I'm so curious.

899
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,230
What's in mine?

900
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,350
$1,000.

901
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,630
I missed a few of those.

902
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,890
Take the $50,000.

903
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,090
All in, baby.

904
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,810
All in, baby.

905
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,650
He's literally... his head is on the...

906
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,550
Google the Monty Hall problem.

907
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,710
I do know it.

908
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,310
The Monty Hall problem.

909
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,070
Switching over... wait.

910
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,110
Switching over staying.

911
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,330
Mythbusters confirmed it.

912
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,830
Trust me when you want to switch.

913
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,730
So, we do want to switch.

914
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,530
Should we swap cases?

915
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,250
You guys, it's a lot of... swap cases?

916
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,150
But we have four.

917
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,150
Believe in four.

918
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,210
Ride the four.

919
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,350
Believe in your case.

920
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,790
I know.

921
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,000
No swap.

922
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,840
Always swap.

923
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,220
Look at them.

924
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:13,720
Oh, my gosh.

925
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,400
We're all bouncing.

926
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,100
Oh, my God.

927
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,860
What is Howie doing?

928
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:16,920
Oh.

929
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,160
You guys!

930
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,580
We should have swapped.

931
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,100
We should have swapped.

932
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,580
What's wrong with you?

933
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,360
What is this?

934
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,040
I got a donkey.

935
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,160
No deal, Mr. Banker.

936
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,480
Refuse a banker's offer of at least $300,000.

937
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,720
Why did they call me a donkey for that?

938
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,980
Oh, stubborn as a mule.

939
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,020
That's so funny.

940
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,540
Yeah, I got $1,000,000.

941
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,120
Just ignore... this is a comma.

942
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,240
$1,000,000.

943
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,280
Hey, $1,000,000 is a lot of money, okay?

944
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,420
So, it's fine.

945
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,960
It's fine.

946
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,900
$1,000,000.

947
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,580
Play again.

948
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,180
Play again.

949
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,460
Mulligan.

950
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,800
Internally crying.

951
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
We should have switched.

952
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,960
I love how it was like, believe in the A.

953
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,500
Everyone's just like, you know that with the Monty Hall problem.

954
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,760
You should switch.

955
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,780
Do it.

956
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:34,020
Hello and welcome to Deal or No Deal.

957
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,140
I'm Howie Mandel.

958
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,540
Hi, Howie.

959
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:36,940
Ladies, please.

960
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,260
Oh, gosh.

961
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,300
Here they come.

962
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,180
Hi, Howie.

963
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,440
Here they come, guys.

964
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:44,780
Oh.

965
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,600
Oh, they're in gold this time.

966
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,640
Woo.

967
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,120
Hi, Howie.

968
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,980
Hi, Howie.

969
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,040
Hi, Howie.

970
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,940
I'm so terrified.

971
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,240
Hello, ladies.

972
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,420
Hi, Howie.

973
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,700
Oh, gosh.

974
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,180
Oh, I love that.

975
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,540
Please say hello to our next player.

976
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,200
Hi, Minto.

977
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,420
Why don't you guys ever greet me like that?

978
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,240
Hello, ladies.

979
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:25,900
Hi, Minto.

980
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,280
Each of those cases is holding a random amount of money placed there by a third party.

981
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,560
We don't know what's in what case, but we do know one case is holding...

982
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:33,960
One case?

983
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,020
...$1,000,000.

984
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,460
One

985
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,270
case.

986
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,490
One case.

987
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:50,810
Did you see that one Howie Mandel TikTok where he showed a dude's butthole and asked if it was COVID related?

988
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,390
Apparently lost sponsors because of it.

989
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,390
Oh, yes.

990
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,370
He showed a prolapsed anus.

991
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:56,630
Yes.

992
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,750
I do remember that.

993
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,570
I never saw the video.

994
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,090
Thank God.

995
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,390
But yes, Howie Mandel posted a prolapsed anus on TikTok.

996
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,790
I don't know why he did it.

997
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,770
Hi, Minto.

998
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:09,490
Hello.

999
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:10,050
Oh.

1000
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,090
I got...

1001
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,250
Boy, I love that.

1002
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,590
He what?

1003
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,730
Yeah, that's what he did.

1004
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,090
Actually, I don't even know what that means.

1005
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,390
What is a prolapsed anus?

1006
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:30,370
I just remember seeing people saying, don't look up Howie Mandel's prolapsed anus.

1007
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,870
I doubt.

1008
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,850
Like the movie?

1009
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,850
Hi, Minto.

1010
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,470
The enemy becomes an Audi.

1011
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,530
What number should we pick everybody?

1012
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,670
What number should we pick?

1013
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,310
Should we pick the girl that looks like me?

1014
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,210
Should we pick number nine who's looking off to the side?

1015
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,170
I don't know where that...

1016
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,070
Oh, she's smiling now.

1017
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:00,990
Okay.

1018
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,290
She noticed that we...

1019
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,110
She broke the simulation for a second there.

1020
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,990
Hi, Minto.

1021
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,130
Hi, Minto.

1022
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:10,710
Hi, Minto.

1023
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:11,490
Hi, Minto.

1024
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:17,930
If I had a nickel for every time you talked about buttholes this week, I would have more money than what's in case 15.

1025
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:18,710
You know what?

1026
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,450
We're going with case 15 then.

1027
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,230
How much is in case 15?

1028
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:25,790
Let's see.

1029
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:27,770
This

1030
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,760
week, I don't think that many.

1031
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,960
To love, to marry, in sickness and in health.

1032
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,780
Let's start by opening up six cases.

1033
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,080
Six cases, baby.

1034
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,200
I'm going to pick one at random.

1035
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:49,880
Eww.

1036
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,880
Oh, it was number four.

1037
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,120
Gayla!

1038
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:01,700
Yay!

1039
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,920
That could have been us, everybody.

1040
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,180
That could have been us.

1041
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,420
Gayla, our queen!

1042
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1043
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,130
Five cases to open.

1044
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,450
Good start, good start.

1045
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,330
14.

1046
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,010
Let's get the fours out of the way.

1047
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:29,790
Correlapse is when an organ or bodily structure escapes the muscles meant to keep it contained.

1048
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,790
It doesn't have to be near an orifice.

1049
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:33,490
What?

1050
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,190
We're off the table already!

1051
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:37,450
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1052
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:38,150
We're killing it.

1053
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,130
Snake's doing his happy dance.

1054
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,190
Happy dance, happy dance.

1055
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:48,090
Four cases.

1056
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:48,790
All right, now 24.

1057
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,310
Get the fours out of the way.

1058
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:56,630
Christy.

1059
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:57,250
Open the case.

1060
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,250
Open the case.

1061
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:00,110
Oh!

1062
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,430
Christy, I'm sending you to jail for that.

1063
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:09,570
Princess Gayla, my beloved.

1064
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,350
Yikes.

1065
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,410
That was a really high one.

1066
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:16,270
That was pretty bad.

1067
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,150
A shame case four has one million inside.

1068
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:19,830
No, it doesn't.

1069
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:20,590
I already opened it.

1070
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,050
Still winnable.

1071
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,150
Yeah, still winnable.

1072
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,270
Number one.

1073
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:32,830
Should we just go in order?

1074
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,390
Minto case, one cent.

1075
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:35,410
No, it's not!

1076
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:40,930
Open the case.

1077
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:42,650
Kathleen.

1078
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:43,330
Okay!

1079
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:44,610
25!

1080
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,070
25!

1081
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,080
How many more do I have?

1082
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,260
Oh, I have two more?

1083
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,120
Two cases left open.

1084
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,140
Case 10 will have under 1,000, I bet.

1085
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,980
Okay, Keely, I'm going to believe you.

1086
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,860
Case 10, case 10, case 10.

1087
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,740
April, April, April, April.

1088
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,380
Open the case.

1089
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,160
That is not under 1,000.

1090
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,120
That is exactly 1,000!

1091
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,600
Not less!

1092
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,820
Profit.

1093
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,660
I think, Keely, you need to go get some lottery numbers today.

1094
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,420
For real.

1095
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:37,900
Bad.

1096
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,240
Dang, Cole.

1097
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,820
It was, it was rounded up.

1098
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,040
It was probably like 999, you know.

1099
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,760
Number 18.

1100
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,300
Number 18.

1101
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:52,780
17, 19.

1102
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:53,640
17?

1103
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,380
I saw two 17s.

1104
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,580
If you are still reading this, there's still time.

1105
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:01,900
Open the case.

1106
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:04,600
Oh!

1107
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,440
Okay.

1108
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,820
Oh, she's pumping the air.

1109
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,660
We seem pretty satisfied with that.

1110
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,320
17 was my pick for a case.

1111
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:16,520
What?

1112
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,900
I mean, that's a pretty, that's a good, that's a lot of money.

1113
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:19,980
The man in this room would just run away.

1114
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,780
There's one job, and it's a nasty job.

1115
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,020
And his job is to get you out of here for as little as possible.

1116
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,140
He's looking at the board.

1117
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:26,400
Okay.

1118
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,120
He's looking at you, and he wants to buy that case for as little as possible.

1119
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:28,700
He's looking at the board?

1120
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,360
He's looking at me?

1121
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,980
He's working it out.

1122
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,940
That's the banker right there.

1123
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,320
He's going to call me and make you an offer right now.

1124
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,560
He's got a nasty job.

1125
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:34,980
Oh, he's nasty.

1126
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:35,920
Oh, yeah.

1127
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,840
Speaking nasty.

1128
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,680
He's speaking nasty to Howie Mandel in his ear.

1129
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,300
He's just like, yeah, you post that in as Howie Mandel.

1130
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,780
Hello.

1131
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:43,200
Yes.

1132
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,120
Yeah, he said okay.

1133
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:44,800
Okay.

1134
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,260
He's speaking nasty words in his little ear.

1135
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,260
He's whispering them.

1136
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:50,760
He's just reading that.

1137
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,060
There's a new offer.

1138
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,920
No deal!

1139
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,620
Or no deal?

1140
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,300
No deal.

1141
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,920
No deal, no deal.

1142
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,280
Yeah, Howie Mandel!

1143
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:15,690
No way.

1144
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:16,370
He's just open.

1145
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:16,730
Don't open?

1146
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,570
Low offer too soon.

1147
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:21,430
Yeah, I think it'd be silly.

1148
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,330
Unless we've lost a million, you know?

1149
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,050
Twelve is looking sus.

1150
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:26,750
Sorry.

1151
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,740
In a bad way or... wait, last time you guys said that, it was really bad.

1152
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,070
12 was just like, I have one penny!

1153
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,170
I hope no one chooses me!

1154
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,390
Dirty, nasty banker.

1155
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,790
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1156
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,820
I don't trust 19.

1157
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,220
We go 20 now?

1158
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,240
20...

1159
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,420
Don't pick 21.

1160
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,340
Not 13.

1161
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:09,820
Okay.

1162
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,540
Go with 11.

1163
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,100
There's so many choices!

1164
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,020
I don't know about you.

1165
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,440
I'm feeling 22.

1166
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,300
How are we splitting what's in your suitcase?

1167
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,440
I mean, what if it's a penny, you know?

1168
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,560
I

1169
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,700
was not feeling 22.

1170
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,800
Okay, three cases left.

1171
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,480
Weird logarithm.

1172
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,520
Thank you for the 10 gifts.

1173
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,360
Thank you.

1174
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:53,820
You guys!

1175
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,480
You guys!

1176
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,040
Okay, we can still get 700.

1177
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,580
Maybe we will take what the banker deals us.

1178
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,220
If it's higher than 100,000.

1179
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,400
Open the case.

1180
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:10,560
75!

1181
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,020
Thanks, Avery.

1182
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:16,860
It's so...

1183
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:23,730
Berserk, welcome to membership.

1184
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:24,010
Thank you.

1185
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,310
Two cases left open.

1186
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:26,690
Don't give the banker the satisfaction.

1187
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,480
Maybe, yeah, if you open it, you don't get the money.

1188
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,300
Basically, the rules of the game is you pick one of these and then you eliminate the rest in hopes that your case has the $1 million.

1189
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,540
Hi, Yao.

1190
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:49,500
11?

1191
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,000
Okay.

1192
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,440
They wouldn't put two big ones next to each other.

1193
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,020
Yeah, surely.

1194
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,320
Woo-hoo!

1195
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,020
$5!

1196
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,060
One case.

1197
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,800
Yeah, you want to get low numbers.

1198
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,160
Leggy kick too.

1199
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:25,270
19.

1200
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:25,610
19.

1201
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,190
I like 19.

1202
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:28,570
I think she's really cute.

1203
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,190
I like her hair color a lot.

1204
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,850
Please, open the case.

1205
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:34,950
Jolene... $10!

1206
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:35,870
Nice!

1207
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,030
If

1208
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:49,600
only we... this would be like the perfect game if we hadn't gotten rid of the 1 million so early.

1209
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:50,740
Oh gosh.

1210
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,760
Our offer's gonna be so low.

1211
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:55,820
Hello.

1212
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:56,300
Okay.

1213
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:58,540
Okay.

1214
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,020
Okay.

1215
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,160
Alright.

1216
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:00,980
Yeah.

1217
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,040
See you tonight, Banker.

1218
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,320
Ugh.

1219
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,100
No way.

1220
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,120
No way.

1221
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,040
Banker, you trying to put a fast one on me, huh?

1222
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,320
No deal.

1223
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,680
No way that we're gonna take that.

1224
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:28,420
I know we lost the 1 million, but there's so many more opportunities to get higher than that amount.

1225
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,520
Like, come on.

1226
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,960
$64,000.

1227
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,440
$64,000?

1228
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,120
Four cases.

1229
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,420
Siege, thanks for the five gifted.

1230
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:35,960
Thank you.

1231
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,880
Ah, you guys.

1232
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,700
You guys, what do I pick?

1233
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,320
Seven?

1234
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:48,580
Seven.

1235
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:50,540
Your...

1236
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:52,840
Open the case.

1237
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,180
Thank you, Dr. Ashton.

1238
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:54,400
Okay.

1239
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,640
You know they don't need that long to tell the price over the phone.

1240
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,700
The Banker's flirting with how he ever calls.

1241
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:08,660
Okay.

1242
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,720
Three cases left, though.

1243
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,320
Three cases left.

1244
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,520
Don't say, ouch.

1245
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:11,880
It's okay.

1246
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,180
It's okay.

1247
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:12,700
It's not that bad.

1248
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,320
It's not that bad.

1249
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,580
It's not that bad.

1250
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,020
It's not that bad.

1251
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:15,480
We're pleased.

1252
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,080
We're okay.

1253
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,220
We're okay.

1254
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,260
25.

1255
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:22,760
Two.

1256
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,860
Lots of twos.

1257
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,860
Lots of twos.

1258
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:27,820
Two.

1259
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:31,980
You.

1260
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,160
Sydney.

1261
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,020
Open the case.

1262
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,200
Open the case.

1263
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:36,460
Oh.

1264
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:36,960
Oh.

1265
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,240
Oh.

1266
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,860
That one is not so great.

1267
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,520
That's...

1268
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:46,250
Looking at my misery.

1269
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,830
Stop clapping.

1270
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,110
Two cases left over.

1271
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,050
Oh.

1272
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:01,250
I think I will go with 26.

1273
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:05,890
You.

1274
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:08,090
Elizabeth.

1275
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:09,150
Open the case.

1276
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:11,710
Okay.

1277
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,110
Nice.

1278
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:14,070
Nice.

1279
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:14,390
Nice.

1280
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:14,610
Nice.

1281
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:15,550
Nice.

1282
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,770
16 has a 500K.

1283
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:21,390
I don't...

1284
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:22,410
How are you so sure?

1285
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:23,970
Are you from the future?

1286
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,110
One case.

1287
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:34,150
I want to ask if you got my friend's gift, which was the mint box from Off-Kai.

1288
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,630
I haven't actually gotten the packages from Off-Kai yet.

1289
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,590
They just shipped them, like, yesterday or the day before.

1290
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:43,630
It was there when he heard you wanted it and he freaked out super hard.

1291
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,150
Did you get my fan art letter postcard?

1292
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:48,630
No.

1293
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,130
Oh.

1294
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:49,550
From Off-Kai?

1295
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,510
I'll check once...

1296
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:54,150
Oh.

1297
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:54,610
The stuff comes.

1298
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:55,730
Okay.

1299
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:56,210
Five?

1300
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:57,330
Do not pick five.

1301
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:58,130
13.

1302
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:00,090
13.

1303
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:02,770
21's looking at me funny.

1304
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:03,630
No.

1305
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:04,230
She's looking away.

1306
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:05,310
She heard you.

1307
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:06,970
Maybe we go with 13.

1308
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:09,750
13.

1309
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:15,130
Amber.

1310
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:15,910
Open the case.

1311
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:18,170
What happened to the audience over there?

1312
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,410
Oh.

1313
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:18,610
No.

1314
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:18,910
Nice.

1315
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:19,110
Nice.

1316
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:19,450
Nice.

1317
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:19,710
Nice.

1318
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:19,990
Nice.

1319
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,290
Nice.

1320
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:20,490
Nice.

1321
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,590
Good job, everybody.

1322
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:21,990
Good job.

1323
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:22,250
Good job.

1324
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:34,910
Here comes the offer.

1325
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,530
He sounds so excited.

1326
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,450
He's like, here comes the offer.

1327
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:38,730
Hello.

1328
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:39,830
Okay.

1329
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:40,550
Okay.

1330
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:41,770
Right.

1331
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:42,410
Yeah.

1332
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:43,030
Yeah.

1333
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,090
That's what you're gonna do, Baker?

1334
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:44,630
Okay.

1335
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:44,890
Okay.

1336
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:45,170
Alright.

1337
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,030
What is it?

1338
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:55,210
Just over...

1339
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:59,890
Just over a hundred thousand.

1340
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,230
I don't know, guys.

1341
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:08,230
Six figures looking pretty tasty.

1342
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:08,750
I know.

1343
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:11,890
I think...

1344
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:13,570
I think I'm gonna do one more.

1345
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,350
I'm gonna do no deal and I'm gonna do for one more.

1346
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:18,970
No deal!

1347
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:21,710
We gonna see if we can get it up higher.

1348
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,530
We can get it up higher, I think.

1349
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:24,250
We can get it up higher.

1350
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:27,590
Okay.

1351
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:28,710
So the case is left open.

1352
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:29,110
I believe.

1353
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:31,070
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe.

1354
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,490
I believe, I believe, I believe.

1355
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:35,190
Let's see.

1356
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,110
Are we in the chat?

1357
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:39,610
21?

1358
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:41,670
Okay, 21.

1359
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,750
All or nothing, Karen.

1360
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:45,390
Open the case.

1361
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:49,090
Nice!

1362
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:49,890
Nice, nice, nice!

1363
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:50,930
5,000!

1364
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:54,990
I wish it was one of the hundreds, but that's okay.

1365
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:55,350
Okay.

1366
00:55:58,330 --> 00:55:59,070
Not bad.

1367
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:01,170
There's also the 50, so...

1368
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,270
Two cases left open.

1369
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,200
A lot of people saying five, some people saying six.

1370
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,200
Some people told me don't pick five.

1371
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,220
I'm gonna go with six.

1372
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,240
I'm superstitious.

1373
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:24,580
If you say don't open one, I'm scared to open it.

1374
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,660
There you go.

1375
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,020
Oh, we're dancing.

1376
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:29,860
Never mind, it's good.

1377
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,040
I think...

1378
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,720
I don't understand these people.

1379
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,800
These are such high numbers.

1380
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,100
I don't understand.

1381
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,280
They're such high numbers.

1382
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,100
Pick five, my lord.

1383
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:49,980
Nine?

1384
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,540
Maybe we'll go with five afterwards.

1385
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,680
Please, open the case.

1386
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,260
Please.

1387
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,380
This is what you're doing.

1388
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,480
You have $50.

1389
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,260
What do you think is gonna happen?

1390
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,720
I'm holding you to that.

1391
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,560
What do you think is gonna happen?

1392
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,240
I'm holding you to that.

1393
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,380
Right.

1394
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,540
Roblox.

1395
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:26,800
Oof.

1396
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:27,480
Okay.

1397
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:27,820
Oof.

1398
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:29,000
Oof.

1399
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,580
A new offer?

1400
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,770
Come on, Banker.

1401
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:35,900
Banker.

1402
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:36,740
Banker.

1403
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:37,640
Banker.

1404
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,100
No deal.

1405
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,420
Deal?

1406
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,320
I won't do it, Banker.

1407
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:41,880
I won't do it.

1408
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:51,540
Are you sure you didn't go to a weird cult meeting with the soulless people watching?

1409
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,040
I swear.

1410
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,700
They're ready to suck my soul.

1411
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,940
Two cases left open.

1412
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,000
Two cases left open.

1413
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,700
Two cases.

1414
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,480
This man thinks of us as a fool.

1415
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:02,780
Yeah.

1416
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,420
Thinks us as a fool.

1417
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,680
Five or 23?

1418
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,580
I like how we're glowing.

1419
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:21,570
Gonna go with 23.

1420
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:25,880
Please.

1421
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,260
Please.

1422
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:26,800
Please.

1423
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,180
Please.

1424
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,800
Please.

1425
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:28,320
Please.

1426
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:28,600
Open the case.

1427
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,080
Please.

1428
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:29,440
Please.

1429
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:29,560
Please.

1430
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:29,800
Please.

1431
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,020
Please.

1432
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:32,260
Please.

1433
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:32,340
Please.

1434
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:34,480
Please.

1435
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,400
Please.

1436
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,420
This is your fault!

1437
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,260
You guys told me 23!

1438
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:44,760
One case.

1439
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:46,380
Okay, I'm gonna go with five.

1440
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,500
At this point, risk it for the biscuit.

1441
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,140
Open the case.

1442
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,380
There you go.

1443
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,740
Why are they clapping?

1444
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,500
Because they feel sorry for him.

1445
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,320
They feel sorry for me.

1446
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,550
If I have the fifty dollars...

1447
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:12,790
What do you think is gonna happen?

1448
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,510
I'll go donate fifty dollars to somebody.

1449
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,130
I'll go donate fifty dollars to...

1450
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,130
to a random VTuber.

1451
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:21,870
Really?

1452
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:22,790
Really?

1453
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:25,070
What do you mean by that?

1454
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:26,390
The offer did go.

1455
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:29,470
117!

1456
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:34,050
Deal or no deal?

1457
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:43,200
So we still have 750, 200, 100.

1458
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,440
50, 400, 750.

1459
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:54,470
It's basically 50-50 to get more money.

1460
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:58,590
Well, I mean 100k is not more, but it's like close enough, maybe.

1461
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,470
One third to do better.

1462
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,150
It's so tempting to just say no deal every time.

1463
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,990
Suddenly case 15 just manifested 50 dollars.

1464
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:22,590
One more case.

1465
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:30,450
It's a horror film.

1466
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:31,010
It's a horror.

1467
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,230
This game is a horror game.

1468
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:33,550
Truly.

1469
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,130
16.

1470
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,130
The one that looks like Minto.

1471
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:43,050
Melanie.

1472
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:43,990
Melanie Minto.

1473
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,380
You guys, I think we're walking out pretty...

1474
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,740
Not so good.

1475
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,140
What do you think's gonna happen?

1476
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,740
I think we're walking out not so good.

1477
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,100
Hello.

1478
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,160
Hello.

1479
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:08,180
Okay.

1480
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,240
Really?

1481
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,320
Really?

1482
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:12,360
Right.

1483
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,640
It's gonna go down.

1484
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:14,960
It's gonna go down for sure.

1485
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,660
The offer went down.

1486
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:17,140
Yeah.

1487
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,680
Oh, no, no, no.

1488
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:21,740
No.

1489
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:22,860
No deal.

1490
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:23,980
No deal.

1491
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,520
I wonder if the audience has any different expressions.

1492
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:40,220
Eight.

1493
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:40,820
Eight?

1494
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,340
Okay, I'm seeing everybody say eight.

1495
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,920
I'm trusting you guys.

1496
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,240
I'm trusting you guys so much.

1497
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,900
I'm trusting you guys.

1498
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,920
I'm trusting you guys.

1499
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,020
I trusted you guys.

1500
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:55,380
I trusted you guys.

1501
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:56,560
I

1502
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,560
can't even afford shoes at this rate.

1503
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,340
I can't afford anything.

1504
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,200
What do you think's gonna happen?

1505
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,820
It's gonna go down, Howie.

1506
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:10,220
Thanks.

1507
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,120
Thanks a lot.

1508
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:11,800
Hello.

1509
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,640
What do you mean what do you think is gonna happen?

1510
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:15,080
Okay.

1511
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,180
The audience is smiling while I'm suffering.

1512
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,040
Look at them.

1513
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,240
New offer?

1514
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,720
Wait, did that go up?

1515
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,940
Or am I crazy?

1516
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,640
Deal or no deal?

1517
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:29,600
No.

1518
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,560
Okay, it went down.

1519
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,000
No deal.

1520
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,380
At this rate...

1521
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,000
At this rate, we're just gonna...

1522
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,660
We're just gonna...

1523
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,780
The odds are really against us.

1524
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,640
But you know...

1525
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,420
The odds are extremely against us.

1526
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:47,960
One case.

1527
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,940
But you know...

1528
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,360
I'm gonna do 25.

1529
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,940
750 or bust, baby.

1530
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,780
Open the case.

1531
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:12,350
Okay.

1532
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:15,210
There's hope.

1533
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:16,590
A new hope.

1534
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:17,590
What do you think's gonna happen?

1535
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,090
Howie, Howie, Howie.

1536
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,190
I'm not writing this fan.

1537
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:23,930
He's like wanting me to continue.

1538
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:24,690
Okay.

1539
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:27,990
He's mauling again.

1540
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:28,730
He's like, please.

1541
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:30,730
Just take the money.

1542
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:36,090
You guys.

1543
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,170
Deal or no deal?

1544
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:39,430
You guys.

1545
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,250
I think I need to take this.

1546
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:44,550
I think I need to take it.

1547
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:46,310
I think I need to take it.

1548
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:54,890
But for the content.

1549
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:54,930
But for the content.

1550
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,200
It's such a good deal.

1551
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:09,560
It's such a good deal.

1552
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:12,980
It's such a good deal.

1553
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,580
But I'm not a smart person.

1554
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:15,300
But I'm not a smart person.

1555
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:15,440
But I'm not a smart person.

1556
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:19,080
I believe in case 15.

1557
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:19,680
I believe in case 15.

1558
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,110
One case.

1559
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,880
18 or 20, you guys.

1560
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,140
Guys.

1561
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:35,780
18?

1562
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:37,880
20?

1563
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:41,080
I'm just gonna close my eyes and pick one.

1564
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:42,960
Oh, wait.

1565
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,040
I can't, I can't see.

1566
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:46,700
I'm trying to feel it with my...

1567
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,120
20.

1568
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:55,390
Open the case.

1569
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,250
Guys.

1570
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:09,980
What do we do?

1571
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:10,380
What do we do?

1572
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:10,840
What do we do?

1573
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:15,800
It's going to go up.

1574
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,060
It's going to go up.

1575
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,180
It's going to go way up.

1576
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,340
Oh my God.

1577
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:21,920
Oh my God.

1578
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:24,340
Swap.

1579
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:24,580
Swap.

1580
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:27,740
It went up.

1581
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,940
Only an idiot would not take this.

1582
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:33,860
Oh my God.

1583
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,200
Oh my God.

1584
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,520
Only an idiot would not take this!

1585
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,640
Only an idiot!

1586
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,620
But I'm not gonna take it.

1587
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,920
We can get the $700!

1588
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,520
We can get the $700!

1589
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:49,460
We can get the $700!

1590
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:49,940
We can get the

1591
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:32,080
$700!

1592
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:42,520
Oh my god, Nano, your case had $750,000!

1593
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:49,520
We went from $750,000 to $750,000!

1594
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:49,980
What

1595
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,420
happened to believing in Case 15?

1596
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,020
But you guys told me to switch!

1597
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,980
You're in your bed.

1598
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,660
My stomach hurts!

1599
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,240
Oh god, I think I'm gonna throw up!

1600
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,740
Oh my god!

1601
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,340
No!

1602
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,900
I'm never gambling ever in my life!

1603
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:30,870
I'm never gambling!

1604
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,040
Wait, what did Nano say earlier too?

1605
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:39,760
It was just like...

1606
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,620
Wasn't it like, I'll pay you more than what's in the case or something?

1607
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,540
Hey, pay up buddy!

1608
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:10,440
You were the luckiest person for 24 rounds to throw it all the way on the 25th.

1609
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:11,680
I can't.

1610
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,380
I can't right now.

1611
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,240
1,800 gambler.

1612
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,000
It's about the... It's a bit about the Monty Hall problem.

1613
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,860
It only applies if the dealer chooses the door that opens.

1614
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,920
So in this, it's just 50-50.

1615
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,040
Oh my god.

1616
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,780
We got this, guys.

1617
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:31,360
We got this.

1618
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:51,710
Don't do this!

1619
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:55,550
Thank you for the...

1620
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:59,690
You had a really good pick, man.

1621
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:03,730
You picked a really good game.

1622
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:08,490
Oh my god.

1623
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:09,930
Betting $2 off Minto.

1624
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,870
We were ever broke.

1625
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:15,850
So far, we have made $1,700.

1626
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:18,730
They

1627
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,960
like, match my ribbons.

1628
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,680
They match my ribbons!

1629
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:41,530
Thank you, guys.

1630
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:42,390
Thank you for the pick.

1631
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:43,710
Hello, ladies.

1632
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:46,050
Hi, Howie.

1633
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:47,170
Oh my god.

1634
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:48,650
Ooh, I love that.

1635
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:49,930
Ooh, I love that.

1636
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:50,950
Please say hello to our next player.

1637
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,190
Ooh, I love that.

1638
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:59,110
The way they all don't blink.

1639
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:00,750
Nobody in this game blinks.

1640
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:01,970
We got 26 lovely ladies holding 26 cases.

1641
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:05,690
Each of those cases is holding a random amount of money placed there by a third party.

1642
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:06,730
Oh, Howie blinked.

1643
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:07,190
We don't know what's in what case.

1644
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,070
But we do know one case is holding...

1645
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:12,590
$1,000,000.

1646
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:16,870
I'm gonna get it.

1647
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:20,310
I'm gonna get the million.

1648
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:21,910
All the way down to one penny.

1649
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:23,130
That's not gonna be me.

1650
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:23,690
Pick a case.

1651
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:34,670
I love that you went from wanting to walk away to shouting, no deal.

1652
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:36,150
I'm all in, baby.

1653
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:38,990
To realizing you made it interesting.

1654
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:40,710
Like, come in and die.

1655
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:42,270
We did it.

1656
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:45,330
13?

1657
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,370
16 again?

1658
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:51,490
We never picked 16 to begin with.

1659
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:58,440
Bro, you're looking like Chibi Titans.

1660
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,220
I don't know about you.

1661
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,680
No, they wouldn't put 20.

1662
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:06,420
They wouldn't put the million in 22 again.

1663
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,320
Forever 17.

1664
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,440
Forever 17!

1665
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,380
I could only afford to pay for one blinking animation.

1666
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,380
Ooh, Veronica.

1667
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,260
To love and to hold, to cherish.

1668
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:35,960
I'm not gonna sell it.

1669
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,740
Not this... I'm not gonna sell it.

1670
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:41,560
I'm not gonna sell it.

1671
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:42,520
God.

1672
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,820
You know what comes after 17?

1673
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:51,280
Never 18.

1674
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:54,280
11?

1675
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,500
Let's go 11.

1676
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,080
You.

1677
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:00,920
Abby.

1678
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,260
Open the case.

1679
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:04,200
How about 17 will be the one million case?

1680
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,120
5000?

1681
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,300
Okay, nice, nice.

1682
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,160
Never go to Vegas, please.

1683
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,650
Not real money.

1684
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:18,170
It's fine.

1685
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:19,210
Right.

1686
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:20,970
You have to open up five more cases.

1687
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,550
Five more cases.

1688
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:25,510
Five more cases, okay.

1689
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:27,910
I'm just gonna guess.

1690
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,150
I'm gonna randomly pick one.

1691
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:31,210
Wait.

1692
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:31,810
Okay, hold on.

1693
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,610
I gotta land on one.

1694
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:35,750
Where'd my mouse go?

1695
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,150
Okay, here.

1696
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:37,490
Ha!

1697
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:38,630
Seven!

1698
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:44,410
Open the case.

1699
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:45,270
Open the case.

1700
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:50,150
We're happy.

1701
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:51,470
We're cheering.

1702
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:58,730
We're cheering.

1703
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:01,410
Four more cases.

1704
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:02,550
We're cheering.

1705
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:02,970
Four more cases.

1706
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:05,070
It could be worse.

1707
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:05,850
It could be worse.

1708
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:10,750
Yeah, let's go with, let's go with Gala.

1709
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,550
Yeah, wrong side of the board.

1710
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:16,170
Come on, Gala.

1711
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:16,430
Open the case.

1712
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:18,370
Gala, Gala, Gala.

1713
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:19,050
Yeah!

1714
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:22,910
Oh, she's so cute.

1715
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:27,850
I love when Snake dances.

1716
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:35,510
Take the first deal offered.

1717
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:37,210
It's gonna be so low.

1718
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:42,510
Let's do... number six.

1719
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:48,150
Hannah.

1720
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:50,290
Bad.

1721
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:07,650
This is just bad, you guys.

1722
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:08,650
This is just bad.

1723
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:09,770
This is just bad.

1724
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:14,590
This is not a good run.

1725
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:16,570
We might just take the...

1726
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:17,950
I don't know about you.

1727
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:21,450
Wait, I clicked 22, right?

1728
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:23,430
22!

1729
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,030
21!

1730
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:26,050
Please, open the case.

1731
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:34,130
It's irrelevant.

1732
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:35,650
You have the one million.

1733
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:40,270
Okay.

1734
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:40,750
Okay.

1735
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:42,030
One case.

1736
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:44,730
Time to avoid 22.

1737
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:47,050
Yeah, God just told me not to pick it.

1738
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:47,530
Okay.

1739
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,090
First number I see...

1740
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:53,090
17 has the million.

1741
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:53,730
Nine.

1742
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:54,410
I saw nine.

1743
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:55,730
You!

1744
01:14:57,850 --> 01:14:58,330
Emily!

1745
01:14:59,090 --> 01:14:59,930
Open the case.

1746
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:04,390
Nice!

1747
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:05,470
Nice, nice, nice.

1748
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:06,550
We're gonna do a little dance.

1749
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:06,890
Yippee!

1750
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:16,920
Yippee!

1751
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,720
There's a man in this room with just one job.

1752
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:19,200
One job?

1753
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,060
A nasty job.

1754
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:23,200
His job is to get you out of here for as little as possible.

1755
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,240
Nasty, nasty man up there.

1756
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:25,280
He's looking at the board.

1757
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,080
He's looking at you and he wants to buy that case for as little as possible.

1758
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,720
Why are you some nasty banker?

1759
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:29,040
He's working it out.

1760
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:29,120
That's the banker right there.

1761
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,840
He's gonna call me and make you an offer right now.

1762
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,020
IRL Eeyore.

1763
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,280
Thank you for the birthday gift.

1764
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,480
Thank you so much.

1765
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:35,340
What do you think is gonna happen?

1766
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:35,920
Thank you.

1767
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,520
Dirty, nasty man.

1768
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,120
He whispers dirty, nasty things in my ear.

1769
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:42,400
Okay.

1770
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,140
Dirty numbers, percentages.

1771
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:45,200
Okay.

1772
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:47,260
Fractions.

1773
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,440
The new offer?

1774
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:50,140
Oh!

1775
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:52,260
I kind of want to take it.

1776
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,700
Deal or no deal?

1777
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:56,620
But it's so bad.

1778
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:00,500
What should we do, guys?

1779
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:04,810
No deal.

1780
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:08,130
We'll go with $100,000 deal.

1781
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:18,470
There's always the what if that makes me want to just push forward.

1782
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:19,230
You know what I'm saying?

1783
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:22,030
There's always the what if.

1784
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,870
There's always the what if.

1785
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,050
That's chump change.

1786
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:26,870
You're so right.

1787
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,750
I doubt it.

1788
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,010
Matthew, don't doubt me.

1789
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:36,270
$25,000.

1790
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:37,530
$25,000.

1791
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:43,450
Lolzy, it better not be $1,000,000 or else I'm gonna be...

1792
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:43,550
Ah!

1793
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:48,950
Lolzy.

1794
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:49,210
Lolzy.

1795
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,610
Lolzy, why?

1796
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:56,250
Lolzy, why?

1797
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:57,090
Lolzy, why?

1798
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:57,650
Four cases.

1799
01:16:58,430 --> 01:16:58,950
Banned.

1800
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:00,910
It was not a million.

1801
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:01,450
That's true.

1802
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:09,380
Pick number three, my lord.

1803
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,220
I'm gonna go with two.

1804
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,120
I'm gonna go with two.

1805
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,000
Open the case.

1806
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:17,840
Open the case.

1807
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:19,440
Ah!

1808
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:22,920
$75,000.

1809
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,280
Man, he said we'll go with $1,000,000.

1810
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:32,020
Yeah, but we've gotten as high as $400,000.

1811
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,160
We can do it again.

1812
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,720
We can get $400,000.

1813
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:39,040
Please pick case three.

1814
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:40,720
Okay.

1815
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,960
I'm stealing all your life force.

1816
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,400
Lolzy, thanks.

1817
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,340
We'll go to membership.

1818
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,260
Open the case.

1819
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:50,860
Ah!

1820
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,120
Yeah.

1821
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:55,600
Yeah.

1822
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,400
Yeah.

1823
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:56,600
Yeah.

1824
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:56,940
Yeah.

1825
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:57,240
Wow.

1826
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,980
The right side is looking awful.

1827
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:01,100
Oh, my gosh.

1828
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,000
It's really dark.

1829
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,580
Two cases left over.

1830
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,640
It's looking not so great for us, you guys.

1831
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,860
That's what every gambler addict says.

1832
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:14,380
That's why I'm not in Vegas, baby.

1833
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,680
I'm feeling 20 in my jellies.

1834
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,160
10.

1835
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,020
15.

1836
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,720
8 for $500 loss.

1837
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:26,560
Statistics don't lie.

1838
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,020
Go 15.

1839
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,040
The math works.

1840
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,900
Okay, James Cameron.

1841
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:31,080
I'm gonna go with $100,000.

1842
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:33,840
I'm believing in you.

1843
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:35,340
15.

1844
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,140
15.

1845
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:37,280
15.

1846
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,600
Please, open the case.

1847
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:39,320
15.

1848
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:39,840
15.

1849
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,520
One more case.

1850
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,460
Still got the million.

1851
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,540
13?

1852
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:13,200
I have a bad feeling about this.

1853
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:18,140
Open the case.

1854
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,360
Oh, my gosh.

1855
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,220
Nevermind!

1856
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:30,330
We still have like all the lowest numbers though.

1857
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:32,150
Every single one of them.

1858
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,970
James Cameron, how could you do that to me?

1859
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:36,350
James Cameron!

1860
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,030
What do you think is going to happen?

1861
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:40,430
That would have changed my afterlife.

1862
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:42,890
500,000 times.

1863
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:45,690
Why did you do that to me?

1864
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:46,990
Right.

1865
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:51,410
I went down!

1866
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:57,930
Our sad face.

1867
01:19:58,230 --> 01:19:59,310
No deal!

1868
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:02,210
Don't let it go down!

1869
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:11,730
What an insulting offer.

1870
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:12,410
I know, right?

1871
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:14,050
We still have the 1 million on the board.

1872
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:20,100
I wonder how like...

1873
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:24,960
Like statistically how easy it is to get like super low numbers.

1874
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,480
Like what is the lowest offer he can give us, I wonder.

1875
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:30,280
Let's see.

1876
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:31,440
18?

1877
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,180
I'm not feeling 22.

1878
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:37,360
Jimmy, you take that back.

1879
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:38,020
Open the case.

1880
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,080
22 is...

1881
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,300
Nice, nice, nice, nice!

1882
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,940
100, 100, 100!

1883
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,780
From what I remember, about 40 cents.

1884
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:56,440
No way.

1885
01:20:59,100 --> 01:20:59,940
26, please.

1886
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,820
Okay, I see two people saying 26.

1887
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:06,940
Skeptical Panda!

1888
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,300
Welcome back, thank you.

1889
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:09,140
Open the case.

1890
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:10,040
26, 26!

1891
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:11,680
There you go.

1892
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:12,620
Yeah!

1893
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,840
I can't even look anymore.

1894
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,260
I can't even look.

1895
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:17,640
This is stressing me out.

1896
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,580
Do all the girls also have the same eye color?

1897
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,700
Are they literally just copied and pasted?

1898
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,360
Two cases left open.

1899
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,800
I think they all have the same eye color.

1900
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,220
Sailor Moon for a turtle!

1901
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,800
Thanks for doing that.

1902
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:34,440
Thank you.

1903
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:37,340
Guys,

1904
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:42,210
what do I do?

1905
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:43,050
Number one?

1906
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,100
Oh God, I don't know about this one.

1907
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,040
I don't know about this one.

1908
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:50,800
I'm not feeling it.

1909
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:52,320
I'm not feeling it.

1910
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,380
Open the case.

1911
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:09,230
I told you all.

1912
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:10,170
One more case.

1913
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:11,810
I told you all, not number one.

1914
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:13,490
I told you!

1915
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:16,810
Let's go for a low score.

1916
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:17,390
You know what?

1917
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:21,010
Yeah, we still have all the lowest numbers.

1918
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:22,750
Let's go for a super-duper low score.

1919
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,670
Okay, then what we're gonna do is go with 22.

1920
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:26,830
22!

1921
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:28,790
Since I was protected from picking that one before.

1922
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:29,650
Open the case.

1923
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:31,590
700.

1924
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:31,950
700.

1925
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:33,290
750!

1926
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:49,720
What do you think's gonna happen?

1927
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:51,080
I don't know.

1928
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,100
It's gonna go down.

1929
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,740
It's gonna go even more down.

1930
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:54,520
Okay.

1931
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:56,560
Okay.

1932
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:57,920
750 for what?

1933
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,200
Versus one cent for the...

1934
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,120
How are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?

1935
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:02,980
A new offer?

1936
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,880
Oh, come on!

1937
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:06,260
Oh, come on!

1938
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,460
Wait, what was the previous one?

1939
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,380
Deal or no deal?

1940
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:11,840
It went up a little tiny.

1941
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,680
Like $2,000 it went up.

1942
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:18,350
Like $2,000.

1943
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:18,790
Less than.

1944
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:19,370
Less than.

1945
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:21,390
$1,900.

1946
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:29,630
A contestant on a UK show was once offered zero pounds and 12 eggs.

1947
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:30,750
What?

1948
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:33,450
You have 750 again.

1949
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:34,290
Don't swap.

1950
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,450
No deal!

1951
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:36,850
No deal!

1952
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:37,730
No deal!

1953
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,230
Like they were rubbing our hands.

1954
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:40,470
We're just like, I don't know, man.

1955
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:40,770
Oh!

1956
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:41,050
Oh!

1957
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:41,770
We're thinking.

1958
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:51,740
I know our odds are looking really bad, but come on!

1959
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:52,780
Three cases left open.

1960
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:56,640
What should I pick?

1961
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:02,700
Trust me this time.

1962
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:03,120
Pick eight.

1963
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:03,580
Okay.

1964
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,020
We're trusting Lozi one more time.

1965
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:11,860
Open the case.

1966
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:12,120
Audra.

1967
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:13,960
Oh!

1968
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:15,860
There's our cent!

1969
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:20,680
It's not enough money for her kids in the home.

1970
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:22,100
Cute.

1971
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,220
Are you okay?

1972
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:27,730
One cent!

1973
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:28,950
Two cases left open.

1974
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:31,270
We finally got one of the low numbers out.

1975
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:33,710
No!

1976
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:37,440
Okay.

1977
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:40,880
Yeah.

1978
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,280
Now we won't get the lowest offer.

1979
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:44,660
10?

1980
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,580
Let's go with 10.

1981
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:50,620
I won't get the lowest offer.

1982
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:51,520
I want to get the million.

1983
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:51,920
Open the case.

1984
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:53,400
I want to get the million.

1985
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:54,840
500.

1986
01:24:55,940 --> 01:25:00,280
I mean, obviously, we're not getting it this game, but I want the million.

1987
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,440
It will happen.

1988
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:08,580
One more case.

1989
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:09,760
One more.

1990
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:13,940
12?

1991
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:14,300
Okay.

1992
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:15,940
19?

1993
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:16,940
Oh, yeah.

1994
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,380
I like her.

1995
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,960
I can't remember her name.

1996
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:22,600
Jan.

1997
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:23,220
Open the case.

1998
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:23,360
Jan.

1999
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:23,980
Jan.

2000
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:25,280
10!

2001
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:28,400
Okay.

2002
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,980
Surely, our offer will go up now.

2003
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:32,720
A little, maybe.

2004
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,040
I think.

2005
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:35,480
Everybody.

2006
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,960
What do you think is going to happen?

2007
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,260
Bye.

2008
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,200
Thanks for the raid.

2009
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:48,600
We're playing Deal or No Deal, and it's really intense.

2010
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:49,080
Right.

2011
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,440
It's like crazy.

2012
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:51,020
Right back.

2013
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:51,600
Thanks for the gift.

2014
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,020
Thanks for the gift.

2015
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:53,500
Thank you.

2016
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:54,660
Thank you guys so much.

2017
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,140
It went up.

2018
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:56,060
It went up.

2019
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:56,480
It went up.

2020
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:57,500
Oh, come on.

2021
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,240
This banker.

2022
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:58,780
I'm like...

2023
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,240
Literally, I'm going to attack you.

2024
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,260
I'm going to find him.

2025
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:03,660
He's molding.

2026
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:05,120
Why are you molding back there?

2027
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,360
Murphy, thanks for the gift.

2028
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:10,640
Why are you molding in here?

2029
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:11,960
You're acting like this is...

2030
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:16,160
I mean, it is a lot of money, but like, comparatively speaking, it's not that much.

2031
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,220
Pyrobug, thanks for the gift.

2032
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:23,840
Tobias, thanks for the gift.

2033
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:25,320
Ducky, thanks for the gift.

2034
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:28,780
That is the end of the game.

2035
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:29,360
That is a lot of money.

2036
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:32,840
I know, but he has offered me $400,000 before.

2037
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:34,640
Two cases left open.

2038
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:35,640
Okay, guys.

2039
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:39,780
Leah, if you're still here, do you want to pick my next case?

2040
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:41,860
If you're still here, Leah.

2041
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,620
If not, I see people saying 5S.

2042
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:50,060
Why?

2043
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:50,880
Thank you for the gift.

2044
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:51,680
Thank you.

2045
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:52,680
Thank you so much.

2046
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,720
This guy is heavy breathing in my ear.

2047
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:00,060
Oh, my God.

2048
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,000
Oh, my God.

2049
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,740
Okay, number 5.

2050
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:04,340
I'm shaking.

2051
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,360
I'm shaking, you guys.

2052
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:06,140
I was shaking.

2053
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:06,980
Okay.

2054
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:08,860
We'll go with 5.

2055
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,580
I redeemed myself.

2056
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,180
Yes, you did.

2057
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:15,820
Thank you.

2058
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:17,180
Open your case.

2059
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:21,810
Joey, thank you for the gift.

2060
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:22,950
Thank you for the gift.

2061
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:31,520
Don't clap.

2062
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,120
Stop clapping.

2063
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:34,880
Don't say nice.

2064
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,000
Don't say nice.

2065
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:37,020
Okay.

2066
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,020
Okay.

2067
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:41,930
Okay.

2068
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:41,950
Okay.

2069
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,990
23 is a low one, trust.

2070
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:48,460
23.

2071
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,240
Yeah.

2072
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:53,060
23, Teresa.

2073
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:55,260
Come on, come on.

2074
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,820
Guys, I think it's Jover.

2075
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:09,910
Dollar, I think we owe him a dollar.

2076
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:12,110
Here comes the offer.

2077
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:18,470
Oh my god.

2078
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:19,090
Okay.

2079
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:21,110
Okay.

2080
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:23,950
The offer is going down.

2081
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:28,310
Come on!

2082
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:31,790
We could have the 750.

2083
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:37,940
No deal.

2084
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:39,720
No deal.

2085
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,200
No deal!

2086
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:45,080
I trust, I trust, I trust, I trust, I trust.

2087
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:49,300
We'll get an achievement for winning more than $700,000.

2088
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,560
One case.

2089
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,680
Take these deals seriously, game.

2090
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,500
I know, right?

2091
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:00,880
One case.

2092
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:03,540
We stand, case 17.

2093
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:04,300
Right?

2094
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,080
20.

2095
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:10,060
12.

2096
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:11,700
16.

2097
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:12,860
Let's go with 16.

2098
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:15,700
Miss Mint Phantom.

2099
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,880
Melanie Phantom.

2100
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:21,480
There you go.

2101
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:22,580
Oh!

2102
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:22,960
Oh!

2103
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:25,830
All right, we have another $700,000.

2104
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:29,130
I think we have the dollars.

2105
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:31,090
I think we have the dollars.

2106
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:32,850
I think we have the dollars.

2107
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:36,790
I think we have the dollars.

2108
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:39,070
Look at us, with our hands on our hips.

2109
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:40,570
Okay.

2110
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:41,510
Hello.

2111
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:42,590
Okay.

2112
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:44,590
Okay.

2113
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:45,770
Yeah.

2114
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:46,670
Right.

2115
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:47,410
Right.

2116
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:51,030
He's like make him take this deal.

2117
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:52,650
Oh!

2118
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:54,030
Oh!

2119
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:12,210
What's so frustrating about it is it's always when it comes down to like the final five that he makes like a good offer, a decent offer, you know?

2120
01:30:14,930 --> 01:30:15,610
One more.

2121
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:17,270
Let's go!

2122
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:17,850
One more!

2123
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:18,670
One more!

2124
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:19,290
One more!

2125
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:19,830
One more!

2126
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:20,330
One more!

2127
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:20,770
One more!

2128
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:23,850
One more!

2129
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:24,290
One more!

2130
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:24,730
One more!

2131
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:26,290
I'm a Catholic!

2132
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:28,150
I can't stop!

2133
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:29,670
I can't stop this.

2134
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:31,230
One more!

2135
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:31,850
One more!

2136
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:33,870
Okay.

2137
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:34,830
One more case.

2138
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:35,470
One more case.

2139
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:45,390
Twenty has one dollar?

2140
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:46,450
Trust?

2141
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:47,150
Trust?

2142
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:48,470
Twenty has one dollar?

2143
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:50,930
Fourteen is so lonely.

2144
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:54,310
Yeah, because she has the 750k.

2145
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:01,830
Open your case.

2146
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:02,510
Open your case.

2147
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:15,180
So average of a number to get rid of.

2148
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:16,080
It's not bad.

2149
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:16,860
It's not good though.

2150
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:18,460
It's just kind of, you know...

2151
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,100
What do you think is going to happen?

2152
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,340
I don't know actually, Howie.

2153
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:24,720
Hello.

2154
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:25,840
Okay.

2155
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,300
I'm not so invested in your relationship with the banker.

2156
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,080
Oh, okay.

2157
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:31,580
I am just... Oh, okay.

2158
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:32,800
You sounded so disappointed.

2159
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,240
It went up.

2160
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,240
Okay.

2161
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:42,020
Deal or no deal?

2162
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:43,380
Oh my God, you guys.

2163
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,320
Only an idiot wouldn't take this.

2164
01:31:54,130 --> 01:31:55,170
One more?

2165
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,530
Should we do one more?

2166
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:00,770
Should we do one more?

2167
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:04,190
We always have the 750k left.

2168
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:04,710
It's crazy.

2169
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,080
You got one more in you.

2170
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:13,920
One more!

2171
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:14,660
One more!

2172
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:17,060
Gamble!

2173
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:17,440
Gamble!

2174
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:17,880
Gamble!

2175
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,020
He's molding.

2176
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:19,840
He's molding.

2177
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:41,980
Fourteen?

2178
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,220
I think fourteen is not a good one.

2179
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,120
I think I'm going to go with twelve.

2180
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:51,620
Twelve.

2181
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,420
Open your case.

2182
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:58,120
Open your case.

2183
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:03,380
Oh my God, the offer is going to be insane, you guys.

2184
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:05,280
What do

2185
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,200
you think is going to happen?

2186
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:17,660
I think we have a dollar, Howie.

2187
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,840
I think we have a dollar in my seventeen case.

2188
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:19,940
Hello.

2189
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:21,120
Okay.

2190
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:23,060
Okay.

2191
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:24,580
Okay.

2192
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:25,280
Okay.

2193
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:25,680
Okay.

2194
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,540
The banker is molding.

2195
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,540
A new offer?

2196
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:32,100
What?

2197
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:33,060
I'm sorry, what?

2198
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:34,740
It didn't even go up.

2199
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:36,700
I thought it was going to go up to like four hundred thousand.

2200
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,120
Wait, it went down.

2201
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:42,380
Why did the offer go down?

2202
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:43,760
Excuse me?

2203
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:46,920
No deal, Mr. Banker.

2204
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:47,980
Why did it go down?

2205
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,280
Yeah, it went lower by like a couple thousand.

2206
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:58,640
Insult.

2207
01:33:58,660 --> 01:33:59,180
They know.

2208
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:02,300
No deal.

2209
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:02,680
No deal.

2210
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:07,960
It's because I have a dollar, isn't it?

2211
01:34:17,450 --> 01:34:18,250
One case.

2212
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:33,920
Yeah.

2213
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,780
You guys, you guys, you guys, you guys.

2214
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:37,720
Please, open the case.

2215
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:42,480
What

2216
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:56,680
do you think is going to happen?

2217
01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:03,590
Okay.

2218
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:04,890
We have a dollar.

2219
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:06,110
We have one dollar.

2220
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:09,910
The offer went down.

2221
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:12,330
Oh my God.

2222
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:13,990
It went down so much.

2223
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:15,830
Poor Snake looks so sad.

2224
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:17,030
Deal or no deal.

2225
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,830
No, I'm taking home my dollar, man.

2226
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,850
I'm taking that home with pride.

2227
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:25,440
A dollar with pride.

2228
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:26,440
We're such an idiot.

2229
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,240
Snake is so dumb.

2230
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:31,680
One dollar and a dream, baby.

2231
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,780
You want to switch cases?

2232
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:34,700
No swap.

2233
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:36,640
Give me my dollar.

2234
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,580
Give me my dollar.

2235
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:40,080
Here it comes.

2236
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:41,180
What?

2237
01:36:11,910 --> 01:36:14,250
We didn't even get the dollar.

2238
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:21,870
I'm not...

2239
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:27,160
Doomed if you do, doomed if you don't.

2240
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,320
This sucks so much.

2241
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,120
Oh my God.

2242
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:36,550
Oh my God.

2243
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:36,730
Oh my God.

2244
01:36:40,810 --> 01:36:41,930
Another $750.

2245
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:46,470
A dollar and a dream.

2246
01:36:47,890 --> 01:36:50,430
This somehow feels like a bigger L than if you...

2247
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:51,850
I know I wanted the dollar.

2248
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:56,430
Here's more money than you want in the game.

2249
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:02,820
I'm never going to Vegas.

2250
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:08,050
It's the desire sensor.

2251
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:08,610
So true.

2252
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:10,110
I think you guys are all the dollars.

2253
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:11,470
You might be disappointment.

2254
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:15,050
You might be a disappointment, but you're our disappointment.

2255
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:19,290
Gosh.

2256
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:23,590
I can't believe it.

2257
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:26,850
This chat isn't even worth one dollar.

2258
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:32,070
Oh man.

2259
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:34,310
Okay, this time.

2260
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:37,110
One million.

2261
01:37:37,370 --> 01:37:38,890
If we don't get the million...

2262
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:40,710
We're taking the bankers deal.

2263
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:42,030
Deal or no deal.

2264
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:42,610
I'm Howard Mandel.

2265
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:43,270
Real.

2266
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:43,670
Real.

2267
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:44,170
Real.

2268
01:37:44,170 --> 01:37:44,330
Real.

2269
01:37:44,370 --> 01:37:45,170
Ladies, please.

2270
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:45,750
Oh.

2271
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:48,090
Hi, Howie.

2272
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:49,310
Oh my God.

2273
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:50,730
Had Leah's viewers seen this yet?

2274
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:51,910
This part is so scary.

2275
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:53,650
Oh, they're in red now.

2276
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:55,350
Oh God.

2277
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:56,150
Here they come.

2278
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:57,430
The la...

2279
01:37:57,430 --> 01:37:59,250
Les enfants terrines.

2280
01:38:00,190 --> 01:38:01,590
It's the genome soldiers.

2281
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:05,230
Hi, Howie.

2282
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:14,070
It's a great gambler.

2283
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:14,870
Hello, ladies.

2284
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:17,030
Hi, Howie.

2285
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:19,730
Oh, I love that.

2286
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:23,310
That's one.

2287
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:24,330
Thank you for the thought.

2288
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:25,350
It's a thank you.

2289
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:28,170
Hi.

2290
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:34,740
We got 26 lovely ladies holding 26 cases.

2291
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:38,440
Each of those cases is holding a random amount of money placed there by a third party.

2292
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:39,460
We don't know what...

2293
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:43,360
Do you think he recorded these for the game or they took them from the TV show?

2294
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,340
One million dollars.

2295
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:52,330
I like the red dresses though.

2296
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:56,010
Like the person that's breathing.

2297
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:56,530
Pick a case.

2298
01:38:56,590 --> 01:38:57,430
Pick a case.

2299
01:38:58,770 --> 01:38:59,370
Okay.

2300
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:06,360
I don't know.

2301
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:08,660
I don't know how to pick.

2302
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,760
Hi, Minto.

2303
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:19,970
Case three.

2304
01:39:23,150 --> 01:39:23,750
Sixteen.

2305
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:26,370
Thirteen.

2306
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:27,230
Thirteen is the million.

2307
01:39:28,210 --> 01:39:29,950
I'm very sure about that.

2308
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:37,530
One...

2309
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:39,850
Case number one had the one million last time.

2310
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:41,070
So I don't think it's this time again.

2311
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:41,890
You know?

2312
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:44,070
Case eight.

2313
01:39:45,350 --> 01:39:46,950
Seems kind of safe, right?

2314
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:48,090
Eight?

2315
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:53,820
I think we're going to go with nine.

2316
01:39:58,550 --> 01:40:00,010
I think I'm feeling nine.

2317
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:08,800
Yippee.

2318
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:11,560
Soulless people jumping in the audience.

2319
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:13,960
Nice.

2320
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:16,180
That's your case to keep, to take home.

2321
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:16,980
To love, to cherish.

2322
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:19,660
To spend, do whatever you want, unless you should decide to sell it.

2323
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,280
I won't.

2324
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:22,220
Let's find out if you got a million dollars in there.

2325
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:22,460
You ready?

2326
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:24,320
There is one million dollars in there, Howie.

2327
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,680
Let's start by opening up six cases.

2328
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:28,400
I'm going to pick number 12.

2329
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:30,000
Oh, there's a bug.

2330
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:31,860
There's a bug.

2331
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:32,240
There's a bug.

2332
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:33,320
Open the case.

2333
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:33,780
No.

2334
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:35,780
Oh, okay.

2335
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:36,140
We're safe.

2336
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:39,780
Back up.

2337
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:40,420
Back up.

2338
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:40,880
Back up.

2339
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:41,360
Back up.

2340
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:41,960
Back up.

2341
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:42,220
Back up.

2342
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:48,670
Back up.

2343
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:48,690
Okay.

2344
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:49,370
The bug saved us.

2345
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:51,050
You have to open up five more cases.

2346
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:53,030
There's a bug in here, though.

2347
01:40:53,150 --> 01:40:53,650
Oh my God.

2348
01:40:53,730 --> 01:40:54,170
Go away.

2349
01:40:55,810 --> 01:40:56,330
Okay.

2350
01:40:57,830 --> 01:40:59,030
Five more cases?

2351
01:40:59,130 --> 01:41:00,210
What do you guys think?

2352
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:01,170
What do you guys think?

2353
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:04,290
A hundred bucks down, baby.

2354
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:06,930
Oh, welcome back.

2355
01:41:06,930 --> 01:41:07,690
Thank you, Calvin.

2356
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:10,070
Five?

2357
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:10,870
Okay, five.

2358
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:17,790
Come here.

2359
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:18,650
Open up.

2360
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:37,090
What if I just go in order?

2361
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:40,270
What if I count down from 26 and just go down?

2362
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:45,330
Whoever... two people that said five.

2363
01:41:45,810 --> 01:41:47,070
What were you thinking?

2364
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:49,030
What were you thinking?

2365
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:50,470
50!

2366
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:50,670
50!

2367
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:54,230
It's not bad.

2368
01:41:58,910 --> 01:41:59,790
Do it.

2369
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,950
All right, next we're gonna count down.

2370
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:05,470
We're gonna count down... 25.

2371
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:11,410
Open the case.

2372
01:42:11,630 --> 01:42:12,430
Come on, Alexis.

2373
01:42:12,650 --> 01:42:13,190
Come on, Alexis.

2374
01:42:13,290 --> 01:42:13,750
Come on, Alexis.

2375
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:23,430
You were doing so well.

2376
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:29,090
It's safe to pick four and six because five is a big number.

2377
01:42:29,210 --> 01:42:31,410
I don't think that's how that works, but we can test it out.

2378
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:32,410
Let's do four.

2379
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:33,530
Let's pick Gayla.

2380
01:42:34,110 --> 01:42:35,310
And then we'll do six.

2381
01:42:36,770 --> 01:42:37,570
Open the case.

2382
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:38,210
Open the case.

2383
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:38,770
Open the case.

2384
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:39,190
Open the case.

2385
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:39,570
Open the case.

2386
01:42:40,850 --> 01:42:41,650
One penny.

2387
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:43,670
Gayla, our girl!

2388
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:45,750
We almost picked that case.

2389
01:42:47,010 --> 01:42:49,170
Also, is Howie supposed to be blonde?

2390
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:53,430
Because his eyebrows are blonde, but his goatee is like brown.

2391
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:54,850
One case.

2392
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:55,790
But he is bald.

2393
01:42:56,150 --> 01:42:57,330
So, I don't know what to believe.

2394
01:42:57,530 --> 01:43:03,030
Does he dye his goatee, or does he bleach his eyebrows?

2395
01:43:03,330 --> 01:43:03,990
I don't know.

2396
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:05,010
All right, six.

2397
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:08,710
Hannah.

2398
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:09,670
Open the case.

2399
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:11,330
Hannah has always done me dirty, though.

2400
01:43:14,330 --> 01:43:15,330
I'm telling you!

2401
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:25,190
She looks so apologetic in the background.

2402
01:43:26,710 --> 01:43:28,690
There's a man in this room with just one job.

2403
01:43:28,890 --> 01:43:29,670
A nasty job?

2404
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:30,850
Oh, it is a nasty job.

2405
01:43:30,850 --> 01:43:33,250
His job is to get you out of here for as little as possible.

2406
01:43:33,470 --> 01:43:34,110
Shaves his head?

2407
01:43:34,490 --> 01:43:34,850
Seriously?

2408
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:38,270
Hair and beard colors can be naturally different.

2409
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:38,690
Really?

2410
01:43:39,190 --> 01:43:40,990
He's going to call me and make you an offer right now.

2411
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:45,950
It's going to be a really bad offer.

2412
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:47,210
It's going to be such a bad offer.

2413
01:43:47,330 --> 01:43:48,530
Joy, thank you for the 50.

2414
01:43:49,230 --> 01:43:50,270
Enjoy your Doom 64.

2415
01:43:50,410 --> 01:43:51,970
Do you plan to play Doom Dark Ages?

2416
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:52,770
I'd like to.

2417
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:54,070
Once it comes out, yeah.

2418
01:43:54,670 --> 01:43:55,030
Maybe.

2419
01:43:55,590 --> 01:43:57,830
So different from like the old school Doom stuff.

2420
01:43:58,090 --> 01:43:58,110
A new offer?

2421
01:44:02,470 --> 01:44:02,910
I don't know.

2422
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:02,910
No.

2423
01:44:03,030 --> 01:44:05,130
As long as the million dollars...

2424
01:44:05,130 --> 01:44:05,670
Deal or no deal.

2425
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:10,110
As long as the million dollars is still up for grabs, you guys, we're not taking the deal.

2426
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:15,710
But once the million is gone, then maybe we should take the deal.

2427
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,910
The million is still out there.

2428
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:19,690
I don't know.

2429
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:21,590
The odds are kind of against us right now.

2430
01:44:22,770 --> 01:44:23,210
But...

2431
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:24,190
But...

2432
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:25,290
But...

2433
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:25,490
But...

2434
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:31,210
But...

2435
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:31,290
But...

2436
01:44:31,290 --> 01:44:32,190
The odds are going to get worse and worse.

2437
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:33,130
No, they're not.

2438
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:34,670
Go with one.

2439
01:44:36,030 --> 01:44:38,310
If this has one million dollars in it...

2440
01:44:38,830 --> 01:44:40,590
I think I'm just gonna jump out this window.

2441
01:44:40,810 --> 01:44:41,310
Open the case.

2442
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:44,030
Okay.

2443
01:44:44,370 --> 01:44:45,130
All right, Kathy.

2444
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:46,570
Okay, Kathy.

2445
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:47,710
Okay, Kathy.

2446
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:51,190
I have a ginger beard and blonde hair, so I attest.

2447
01:44:52,230 --> 01:44:53,490
You have a beard?

2448
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:56,610
My eyebrows are dirty, blonde, and my beard is jet black.

2449
01:44:56,870 --> 01:44:58,070
You have a beard?

2450
01:44:59,650 --> 01:45:00,970
How did you grow that?

2451
01:45:01,110 --> 01:45:01,270
You have a beard?

2452
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:01,270
How did you grow that?

2453
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:08,420
You have a beard?

2454
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:08,480
Here we go.

2455
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:11,500
I'm starting to think that in life, men can't deal.

2456
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:13,520
Well, luckily, I'm in the afterlife.

2457
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:20,560
We're shuffling.

2458
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:22,000
We're shuffling dancing.

2459
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:24,860
We're so happy.

2460
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:28,820
Even though it's a lot of stuff from the right side of the board, but that's okay.

2461
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:29,800
Okay, three cases left open.

2462
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,320
Number three, baby.

2463
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:33,380
Number three, baby.

2464
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:33,860
Number three, baby.

2465
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:35,900
Number three, baby.

2466
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:37,800
Open the case.

2467
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:40,880
Yeah!

2468
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:42,140
It's

2469
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:51,170
nice.

2470
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:52,750
500k.

2471
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:53,090
No.

2472
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:54,190
Two cases.

2473
01:45:54,270 --> 01:45:54,610
All right, guys.

2474
01:45:55,630 --> 01:45:56,810
Two more cases.

2475
01:45:56,910 --> 01:45:57,570
What should we pick?

2476
01:45:58,110 --> 01:45:59,310
What should we pick?

2477
01:45:59,530 --> 01:46:00,690
What should we pick?

2478
01:46:01,010 --> 01:46:02,190
What should we pick?

2479
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:03,270
What should we pick?

2480
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:03,290
What should...

2481
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:04,770
Twenty two has one million for sure.

2482
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:06,050
No, I have one million.

2483
01:46:10,350 --> 01:46:10,790
23?

2484
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:14,070
23.

2485
01:46:19,150 --> 01:46:21,550
Mine has mint-a-zillion dollars.

2486
01:46:22,630 --> 01:46:24,010
Open your case.

2487
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:25,890
Yeah!

2488
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:28,930
One

2489
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:34,730
million still on the board.

2490
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:37,170
One million still on the board.

2491
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:40,070
One case.

2492
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:41,890
Okay.

2493
01:46:45,110 --> 01:46:45,990
Okay.

2494
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:51,960
You guys...

2495
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:53,340
Okay.

2496
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,360
Okay.

2497
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:58,000
What should we do?

2498
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:05,800
Look at the scary people in the back.

2499
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:06,460
Oh, God!

2500
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:07,060
Howie!

2501
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:08,880
He's, like, sniffing me.

2502
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:10,680
Howie, you're too close.

2503
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,280
What are you doing there, Howie?

2504
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:17,360
Twelve?

2505
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:18,700
Okay.

2506
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,500
We'll go with twelve.

2507
01:47:23,290 --> 01:47:24,450
Twelve has to go.

2508
01:47:25,490 --> 01:47:25,970
Sarah.

2509
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:26,410
Open the case.

2510
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:27,990
Open the case.

2511
01:47:28,210 --> 01:47:28,610
Yeah!

2512
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:30,470
Oh, my God.

2513
01:47:32,410 --> 01:47:32,810
Okay.

2514
01:47:33,070 --> 01:47:35,150
Maybe we'll get an okay offer this time.

2515
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:37,630
We got rid of some low ones.

2516
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:42,910
Would love a...

2517
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:45,510
Who wants to be a millionaire stream or collab sometime in the future?

2518
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:45,670
Here comes the offer.

2519
01:47:45,670 --> 01:47:46,530
I would love to do that, too.

2520
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:50,970
I actually owned that for the PlayStation when I was a kid.

2521
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:52,130
Who wants to be a millionaire?

2522
01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:54,050
Okay.

2523
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:54,350
Okay.

2524
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:54,790
Okay.

2525
01:47:55,610 --> 01:47:56,010
Yeah.

2526
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:56,450
Yeah.

2527
01:47:56,490 --> 01:47:57,810
Give it to me straight, Howie.

2528
01:47:57,810 --> 01:47:58,070
Am I...

2529
01:47:58,710 --> 01:47:59,690
Is it terminal?

2530
01:47:59,970 --> 01:48:00,370
What?

2531
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:00,470
Oh, my God.

2532
01:48:00,490 --> 01:48:00,870
What the hell?

2533
01:48:01,390 --> 01:48:02,150
Me, blonde.

2534
01:48:02,330 --> 01:48:03,690
My brother, brunette.

2535
01:48:03,850 --> 01:48:05,410
And my father all have different hair colors.

2536
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:05,770
Deal or no deal?

2537
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:07,910
But all of our beards are red.

2538
01:48:08,990 --> 01:48:10,850
Why do you all have beards?

2539
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:16,030
There's still...

2540
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:17,290
Doshiyo.

2541
01:48:18,230 --> 01:48:18,710
Doshiyo.

2542
01:48:22,570 --> 01:48:23,370
Rock boss.

2543
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:24,290
Thanks for the dollar.

2544
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:27,190
Howie, I'm a wisp, not a mathematician.

2545
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:28,230
No deal.

2546
01:48:28,790 --> 01:48:29,270
Oh, my God.

2547
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:30,470
Oh, my God.

2548
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:31,470
Are you a wisp?

2549
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:31,750
Red beard.

2550
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:32,110
Yeah.

2551
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:33,190
Red beard.

2552
01:48:33,310 --> 01:48:33,530
Yeah.

2553
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:40,450
Mint, where's your beard?

2554
01:48:40,870 --> 01:48:42,050
I'm working on it.

2555
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:43,070
I'm working on it.

2556
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:51,840
17?

2557
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:53,840
I've seen several people say 17.

2558
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:55,860
I think this one has the million.

2559
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:58,480
I think this one has the million.

2560
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:00,860
This one has the million.

2561
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:02,600
500.

2562
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:04,300
Half a million.

2563
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:08,150
50,000.

2564
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:16,200
I'm about to say, It's the 50.

2565
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:18,680
I'm a mint, not a mathematician.

2566
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:20,700
I'm not a mint-metician.

2567
01:49:21,970 --> 01:49:24,880
I'm a mint... I'm a mint-metician!

2568
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:26,440
Fourteen!

2569
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:30,280
Yo!

2570
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:33,540
Open the case.

2571
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:36,320
Nice-o!

2572
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:40,360
Nice-o!

2573
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,160
Two cases left.

2574
01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:58,070
What do you say, guys?

2575
01:49:58,210 --> 01:49:58,630
What do you say?

2576
01:49:59,870 --> 01:50:00,330
What.

2577
01:50:00,330 --> 01:50:00,790
Do.

2578
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:01,550
We.

2579
01:50:01,790 --> 01:50:02,250
Say.

2580
01:50:02,810 --> 01:50:04,770
One dollar still on the table.

2581
01:50:04,810 --> 01:50:05,010
Really?

2582
01:50:05,330 --> 01:50:06,390
Oh my god, you're right.

2583
01:50:11,310 --> 01:50:11,770
Nineteen!

2584
01:50:14,490 --> 01:50:15,850
Yes, we love Jun Yun Min.

2585
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:16,530
Yes.

2586
01:50:17,030 --> 01:50:17,830
Open the case.

2587
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:18,550
Come on!

2588
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:23,880
Open!

2589
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:24,160
We're fine.

2590
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:24,920
He's clapping.

2591
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:27,020
Those are some aggressive claps.

2592
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:29,660
He's like, we're okay.

2593
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:30,860
We're okay.

2594
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:31,440
We're okay.

2595
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:32,720
We're okay.

2596
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:33,180
We're okay.

2597
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:34,600
Still one million on the board.

2598
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:35,100
We're okay.

2599
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:35,560
We're okay.

2600
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:36,000
We're okay.

2601
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:39,040
Seven!

2602
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:41,400
Seven!

2603
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:42,520
Liner!

2604
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:44,100
Oh, I accidentally skipped it.

2605
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:45,660
I love when he does that.

2606
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:01,770
Our deal is gonna be...

2607
01:51:02,150 --> 01:51:03,350
So bad!

2608
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:08,770
The banker's gonna lowball us so much!

2609
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:09,930
Okay.

2610
01:51:11,450 --> 01:51:12,010
Okay.

2611
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:13,330
Okay.

2612
01:51:15,230 --> 01:51:16,570
The new offer...

2613
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:23,670
Deal or no deal?

2614
01:51:24,830 --> 01:51:25,850
Deal or no deal?

2615
01:51:25,850 --> 01:51:26,930
It could be better.

2616
01:51:27,110 --> 01:51:28,130
Or, I mean, it could be worse.

2617
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:34,740
I think I'm gonna take it.

2618
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,420
I think I'm gonna take it, you guys.

2619
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:39,320
I want the million!

2620
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:41,500
We'll do another game.

2621
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:47,280
We got lowballed so much.

2622
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,160
We got lowballed so much.

2623
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:55,820
What was in our case?

2624
01:51:57,020 --> 01:51:57,840
Is it a dollar?

2625
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:01,080
We're waiting.

2626
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:12,250
I can't read it!

2627
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:13,390
It's all two pixels!

2628
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:24,740
What is this game having to do with me?

2629
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,620
I'm never going on this TV show.

2630
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:38,760
Your luck is so weird.

2631
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:40,320
Welcome to my afterlife.

2632
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:44,520
This is just the Minto way.

2633
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:47,320
All right.

2634
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:52,040
This is the One Million One million dollars!

2635
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:53,920
This is it!

2636
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:54,440
This is it!

2637
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:55,080
One million!

2638
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:55,680
One million!

2639
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:56,280
One million!

2640
01:52:56,380 --> 01:52:56,840
One million!

2641
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:57,480
One million!

2642
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:58,060
One million!

2643
01:52:58,120 --> 01:52:58,120
One million!

2644
01:52:58,120 --> 01:52:58,840
One million!

2645
01:52:58,900 --> 01:52:59,320
One million!

2646
01:52:59,400 --> 01:52:59,400
One million!

2647
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:01,020
You're the best gambler ever.

2648
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:02,500
Vegas loves me.

2649
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:07,020
Vegas would truly love me.

2650
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:13,000
But I was interested to see what happens if you choose the deal, you know.

2651
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:14,020
Ladies, please.

2652
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:15,680
Ladies, please.

2653
01:53:20,650 --> 01:53:23,030
The screen came from somewhere dark and...

2654
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:23,770
Purple!

2655
01:53:25,050 --> 01:53:26,970
Will those hips don't not lie?

2656
01:53:28,550 --> 01:53:30,690
I've never seen anyone so bad.

2657
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:31,570
I can't believe it.

2658
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:32,890
Stop!

2659
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:35,710
Why do you guys make me feel so bad about myself?

2660
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:42,720
Here it is.

2661
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:43,500
Hi, ladies.

2662
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:44,060
Hello, ladies.

2663
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:46,260
Hi, Howie.

2664
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,060
Oh, I love that.

2665
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:49,060
Oh, I love that.

2666
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:51,380
Please say hello to our next player.

2667
01:53:56,850 --> 01:53:59,790
They're like, haven't you been on this show like 50 times?

2668
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:04,830
Our earnings don't even add up to like 100,000, I think.

2669
01:54:04,830 --> 01:54:07,630
Each of those cases is holding a random amount of money placed there by third party.

2670
01:54:07,730 --> 01:54:10,130
Our earnings are so bad, you guys.

2671
01:54:10,370 --> 01:54:11,670
Like a total earnings.

2672
01:54:12,650 --> 01:54:14,550
One case is holding one million dollars.

2673
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:25,670
Pick a case.

2674
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:27,470
We're going to pick a case?

2675
01:54:37,790 --> 01:54:38,910
Hi, Minto.

2676
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:43,350
Snake makes the ratings go wild.

2677
01:54:57,510 --> 01:54:59,990
Guy giving up before taking time to be here.

2678
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:11,220
Lucky seven.

2679
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:12,620
No, it just had the million.

2680
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:14,580
So it won't have it again.

2681
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:18,840
But maybe number eight will have it.

2682
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:21,260
Wait, didn't we?

2683
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:22,560
No, we picked nine before.

2684
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:24,860
And seven had it.

2685
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:25,820
It's got to be eight.

2686
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,480
It's got to be the middle of the three of them.

2687
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:35,510
Audra, I'm taking your box.

2688
01:55:35,530 --> 01:55:36,370
Get off the screen.

2689
01:55:37,190 --> 01:55:38,190
Get off the screen.

2690
01:55:40,210 --> 01:55:45,730
That's your case to keep, to take home, to spend, do whatever you want, unless you should decide to sell it.

2691
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:46,010
No.

2692
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:47,130
Maybe.

2693
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:48,130
I don't know actually.

2694
01:55:48,230 --> 01:55:48,530
You ready?

2695
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:51,730
Let's start by opening up six cases.

2696
01:55:51,730 --> 01:55:52,350
Okay.

2697
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:55,290
Let's start.

2698
01:55:55,410 --> 01:55:56,450
I should have picked number six.

2699
01:55:56,570 --> 01:55:57,130
Six always...

2700
01:55:57,130 --> 01:55:57,490
You know what?

2701
01:55:57,550 --> 01:56:00,150
I'm going to start with six because six always has a high number.

2702
01:56:00,590 --> 01:56:02,870
If it has one million, I'm literally giving up.

2703
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:06,110
Hannah.

2704
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:13,140
See, I'm telling you, it always has a high number.

2705
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:19,300
You're making all of us who lost our Firefly 5050s feel better, so thanks for that, Minto.

2706
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:24,700
You should go to Vegas with Matara and have you do all the killing for her.

2707
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:29,460
Every time, six has such a high number.

2708
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:35,520
Every time.

2709
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:36,980
Hannah's out to get us, man.

2710
01:56:37,540 --> 01:56:38,620
Let's go with 19.

2711
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:44,010
Okay.

2712
01:56:45,370 --> 01:56:46,190
Open the case.

2713
01:56:48,130 --> 01:56:48,590
$5.

2714
01:56:49,090 --> 01:56:49,150
$5.

2715
01:56:50,730 --> 01:56:51,130
Okay.

2716
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:52,330
Perhaps you should have picked case six.

2717
01:56:52,770 --> 01:56:54,450
No, no, because that's not one million.

2718
01:56:55,490 --> 01:56:56,850
That's not one million.

2719
01:56:57,270 --> 01:56:58,850
But maybe we will pick it next time.

2720
01:57:01,390 --> 01:57:01,790
Okay.

2721
01:57:01,850 --> 01:57:02,350
Four cases.

2722
01:57:04,170 --> 01:57:04,870
Number 12.

2723
01:57:05,970 --> 01:57:06,790
I'm going to do it.

2724
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:08,090
Maybe do it by rows, right?

2725
01:57:11,510 --> 01:57:11,910
Okay.

2726
01:57:14,910 --> 01:57:15,670
Open the case.

2727
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:16,910
Open the case, Sarah.

2728
01:57:18,250 --> 01:57:19,030
The penny!

2729
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:19,130
The penny!

2730
01:57:22,070 --> 01:57:24,990
We're dancing, we're dancing, we're dancing, we're dancing, we're dancing, we're dancing.

2731
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:31,160
Very nice.

2732
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:33,780
Okay, three cases left open.

2733
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:34,160
You guys.

2734
01:57:51,550 --> 01:57:52,030
26.

2735
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:53,670
All right.

2736
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:54,870
Fernando says 26.

2737
01:57:58,650 --> 01:57:59,390
Please, Elizabeth.

2738
01:57:59,390 --> 01:57:59,930
Open the case.

2739
01:58:00,150 --> 01:58:00,550
Elizabeth.

2740
01:58:15,030 --> 01:58:16,930
Two cases left open.

2741
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:19,270
Two

2742
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:35,040
cases left open.

2743
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:35,080
Okay.

2744
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:35,560
$5.

2745
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:35,960
Two.

2746
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:40,380
I'm so sorry.

2747
01:58:45,670 --> 01:58:46,430
Choo choo!

2748
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:51,150
Okay.

2749
01:58:51,730 --> 01:58:53,430
We have one more I think, right?

2750
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:58,440
One more case.

2751
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:00,160
One more case.

2752
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:01,340
Eleven, baby!

2753
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:02,840
Okay, let's go for eleven.

2754
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:09,260
Open the case.

2755
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:13,280
Oh my god.

2756
01:59:13,340 --> 01:59:14,440
We are so boned.

2757
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:18,720
We are so boned!

2758
01:59:26,590 --> 01:59:28,770
Does he have a giant nasty job?

2759
01:59:29,170 --> 01:59:30,070
It's a nasty job!

2760
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:35,610
I feel like I'm reliving the same day over and over and over again.

2761
01:59:38,430 --> 01:59:39,230
Banker right there.

2762
01:59:39,930 --> 01:59:40,490
Okay.

2763
01:59:42,270 --> 01:59:42,830
What?

2764
01:59:45,930 --> 01:59:47,770
I think I'm gonna get a shit offer, Howie, okay?

2765
01:59:48,410 --> 01:59:48,950
Hello.

2766
01:59:49,530 --> 01:59:50,070
Okay.

2767
01:59:50,310 --> 01:59:50,850
Okay.

2768
01:59:53,190 --> 01:59:55,190
Howie, do you grow hair?

2769
01:59:56,510 --> 01:59:57,950
They had to animate...

2770
01:59:57,950 --> 02:00:02,910
They even put his neck folds on the back of his head.

2771
02:00:03,830 --> 02:00:05,830
They even put that on his model.

2772
02:00:08,150 --> 02:00:08,930
No deal.

2773
02:00:10,710 --> 02:00:12,830
Do I ever accept the deal?

2774
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:15,310
Oh!

2775
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:23,570
Just like Bill Murray, but you're not learning.

2776
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:24,670
What are you talking about?

2777
02:00:24,730 --> 02:00:25,630
It's different every day!

2778
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:28,710
Oh...

2779
02:00:31,970 --> 02:00:33,290
Leave Howie alone?

2780
02:00:35,390 --> 02:00:36,470
That guy...

2781
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:39,430
posts butts on the internet, so...

2782
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:44,430
Endless eight dollars.

2783
02:00:47,150 --> 02:00:49,570
Re-zero starting after life broke.

2784
02:00:50,790 --> 02:00:51,350
Re-zero starting after life broke.

2785
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:54,030
One for one dollar?

2786
02:00:54,990 --> 02:00:56,750
One for one dollar!

2787
02:01:08,990 --> 02:01:09,010
One for one dollar!

2788
02:01:09,570 --> 02:01:10,130
Yipper!

2789
02:01:19,130 --> 02:01:20,210
Four more cases.

2790
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:28,650
Groundhog deal.

2791
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:31,330
You know what?

2792
02:01:31,370 --> 02:01:32,590
Since we just got four hundred...

2793
02:01:34,110 --> 02:01:34,670
Sorry.

2794
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:36,230
I will pick four.

2795
02:01:36,350 --> 02:01:38,790
Open the case, Gaila!

2796
02:01:39,310 --> 02:01:39,870
Yeah!

2797
02:01:48,370 --> 02:01:48,930
Nice.

2798
02:01:49,090 --> 02:01:49,730
Twenty-one?

2799
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:51,150
Okay, we'll go for twenty-one next.

2800
02:01:53,010 --> 02:01:54,330
Okay, three cases left open.

2801
02:01:54,350 --> 02:01:55,750
I don't know about you.

2802
02:01:57,470 --> 02:01:59,110
But it's not twenty-two.

2803
02:02:00,690 --> 02:02:01,170
Beep.

2804
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:02,310
Weep.

2805
02:02:02,910 --> 02:02:03,910
Open the case.

2806
02:02:04,130 --> 02:02:05,110
Come on, come on, come on.

2807
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:08,950
Oh my god.

2808
02:02:09,070 --> 02:02:10,690
Yeah, we're jiving.

2809
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:16,160
We're grooving.

2810
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:17,040
I hope I get a dollar.

2811
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:19,660
I want one dollar.

2812
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:21,080
Two cases left open.

2813
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:23,600
One dollar, one dollar, one dollar.

2814
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:27,480
One dollar.

2815
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:28,380
One dollar.

2816
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:29,000
One dollar, one dollar.

2817
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:32,360
Take your luck.

2818
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:33,080
I had a shotgun.

2819
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:33,860
See what happens.

2820
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:35,920
Care to try buckshot roulette?

2821
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:37,580
I've actually been interested in trying that.

2822
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:40,620
But I think I saw that it was a pretty short game, right?

2823
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:41,420
Twenty-five?

2824
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:43,100
Twenty-five?

2825
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:45,420
Oh, I almost clicked twenty-four.

2826
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:46,500
Twenty-five.

2827
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:50,520
Open the case.

2828
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:51,060
Come on, Alexis.

2829
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:54,320
Wow.

2830
02:03:03,630 --> 02:03:04,470
Number fifteen.

2831
02:03:04,750 --> 02:03:05,790
Number fifteen.

2832
02:03:06,110 --> 02:03:06,650
One more case.

2833
02:03:06,690 --> 02:03:08,230
One million dollars.

2834
02:03:09,650 --> 02:03:10,530
One more case.

2835
02:03:10,610 --> 02:03:11,070
This is it.

2836
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:12,230
This is it.

2837
02:03:12,230 --> 02:03:12,650
This is it.

2838
02:03:12,650 --> 02:03:13,050
This is it.

2839
02:03:13,070 --> 02:03:13,430
This is it.

2840
02:03:13,490 --> 02:03:14,930
Open the case.

2841
02:03:16,930 --> 02:03:17,770
One dollar!

2842
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:31,120
Okay.

2843
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:33,260
It's good for a short stream.

2844
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:34,200
What do you think is going to happen?

2845
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:37,660
Oh gosh.

2846
02:03:37,720 --> 02:03:37,980
Hello.

2847
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:38,740
Yeah.

2848
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:39,060
Okay.

2849
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:42,840
You nasty, nasty man.

2850
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:43,820
You dirty...

2851
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:44,340
Okay.

2852
02:03:45,780 --> 02:03:46,220
Okay.

2853
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:49,220
Oh!

2854
02:03:49,220 --> 02:03:49,880
Seventy-one.

2855
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:53,700
But we still have one million on the board, everybody.

2856
02:03:54,780 --> 02:03:57,380
We still have one million on the board.

2857
02:03:57,460 --> 02:04:00,940
One million on the... I mean we have a lot of like ten and seventy-five.

2858
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:02,020
How many is there?

2859
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:03,320
Four, five, six, seven.

2860
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:06,120
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2861
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:06,520
Oh wait!

2862
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:09,220
We actually have eight on the right side and seven on the left side.

2863
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:11,000
No deal.

2864
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:15,360
The odds are in my favor!

2865
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:21,980
With mince luck, backshot roulette.

2866
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:23,300
Oh, not backshot.

2867
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:24,040
Buckshot.

2868
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:24,500
Sorry.

2869
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:28,280
Isn't that something else?

2870
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:29,400
A backshot?

2871
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:33,740
Just get to six figures.

2872
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:34,620
I'm trying!

2873
02:04:36,820 --> 02:04:37,780
I'm trying!

2874
02:04:37,940 --> 02:04:38,540
I'm trying!

2875
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:46,820
Buckshot roulette will be short.

2876
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:47,100
Buckshot roulette will be short.

2877
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:47,100
Buckshot roulette will be short.

2878
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:47,760
No, it won't.

2879
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:50,960
I'm gonna go for seventeen.

2880
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:51,320
Seventeen.

2881
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:55,180
Yep.

2882
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:58,120
Open the case.

2883
02:04:58,260 --> 02:04:58,700
Open the case.

2884
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:00,500
Three hundred!

2885
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:03,700
Very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice.

2886
02:05:04,120 --> 02:05:04,600
Yippee!

2887
02:05:13,530 --> 02:05:14,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2888
02:05:15,390 --> 02:05:16,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2889
02:05:16,690 --> 02:05:18,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2890
02:05:18,950 --> 02:05:20,630
Just ignore what I said earlier.

2891
02:05:29,910 --> 02:05:31,450
Guys, come on, I need help!

2892
02:05:31,710 --> 02:05:33,190
Come on, I need your opinions!

2893
02:05:33,590 --> 02:05:34,610
What do I choose?

2894
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,040
Five.

2895
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:48,520
Yep.

2896
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:51,900
Open the case.

2897
02:05:51,900 --> 02:05:52,600
Open the case.

2898
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:55,180
Ah!

2899
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:56,140
Nine!

2900
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:58,500
It's not great.

2901
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:03,360
Nine?

2902
02:06:03,780 --> 02:06:04,740
Wait, didn't we pick?

2903
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:05,760
No, we picked eight, right?

2904
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:07,220
Okay, we'll do nine next.

2905
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:09,320
Two cases left open.

2906
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:09,820
Nine.

2907
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:10,360
Nine.

2908
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:11,580
Nine!

2909
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:17,600
Emily.

2910
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:18,500
Emily!

2911
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,060
Five hundred!

2912
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:22,740
Okay.

2913
02:06:33,990 --> 02:06:35,270
One more.

2914
02:06:35,290 --> 02:06:37,810
Yeah, there's no way seven has the million this time.

2915
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:38,410
You're so right.

2916
02:06:41,250 --> 02:06:42,090
You're right.

2917
02:06:42,730 --> 02:06:43,870
I can't press it.

2918
02:06:43,930 --> 02:06:44,890
I'm shaking too much.

2919
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:47,950
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

2920
02:06:48,150 --> 02:06:48,910
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

2921
02:06:48,910 --> 02:06:51,550
Wait, the AI summary is about what?

2922
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:51,990
Open the case.

2923
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:01,730
We're pelvic thrusting now?

2924
02:07:04,390 --> 02:07:05,450
Was that the last one?

2925
02:07:06,610 --> 02:07:07,130
Yep.

2926
02:07:08,170 --> 02:07:09,290
Okay, here we go.

2927
02:07:09,290 --> 02:07:09,850
What's gonna happen?

2928
02:07:12,850 --> 02:07:13,410
Hello.

2929
02:07:13,930 --> 02:07:14,490
Okay.

2930
02:07:15,550 --> 02:07:16,110
Okay.

2931
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:17,530
Okay.

2932
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:22,050
It's funny because one of my friends was just like...

2933
02:07:22,050 --> 02:07:22,910
The new opera?

2934
02:07:23,310 --> 02:07:28,170
Was like, I think you might need to start thinking about an 18 plus tag.

2935
02:07:28,650 --> 02:07:29,190
Deal?

2936
02:07:29,450 --> 02:07:30,230
Or no?

2937
02:07:30,450 --> 02:07:31,630
On Twitter.

2938
02:07:32,130 --> 02:07:36,150
So, um, I think I'll probably add one.

2939
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:41,190
I didn't know what an un-birther was!

2940
02:07:41,470 --> 02:07:41,850
Okay?

2941
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:45,490
No deal!

2942
02:07:45,610 --> 02:07:46,550
No deal on this!

2943
02:07:46,690 --> 02:07:47,250
No deal!

2944
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:47,790
No deal!

2945
02:07:58,530 --> 02:08:00,070
Okay, three cases left, though.

2946
02:08:02,070 --> 02:08:02,550
Okay.

2947
02:08:07,890 --> 02:08:09,750
What does this mean down here?

2948
02:08:09,870 --> 02:08:10,470
The little...

2949
02:08:10,470 --> 02:08:11,950
The little dot.

2950
02:08:13,110 --> 02:08:16,830
But also, he said like there's sometimes you can get like a million dollar...

2951
02:08:17,610 --> 02:08:18,470
Offer some...

2952
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:19,910
Like minigame or something.

2953
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:20,730
So...

2954
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:23,670
Okay.

2955
02:08:25,410 --> 02:08:28,050
People have already started using mating press.

2956
02:08:28,430 --> 02:08:29,790
Why are you making up your own tags?

2957
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:32,150
I haven't even put...

2958
02:08:32,150 --> 02:08:33,510
I haven't even told you what it is.

2959
02:08:37,530 --> 02:08:39,050
Oh, it's the player on the Wii!

2960
02:08:39,250 --> 02:08:44,630
Oh, it's the Wiimote.

2961
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:46,950
You're right!

2962
02:08:47,510 --> 02:08:48,410
You're so right.

2963
02:08:49,070 --> 02:08:50,350
I thought it was part...

2964
02:08:52,110 --> 02:08:53,790
Can this game be multiplayer?

2965
02:08:54,090 --> 02:08:55,030
It doesn't seem very fair.

2966
02:08:55,370 --> 02:08:55,950
Okay.

2967
02:08:56,170 --> 02:08:57,150
Number 23.

2968
02:08:58,170 --> 02:08:58,750
Yeah.

2969
02:08:59,630 --> 02:09:00,650
Come on, guys.

2970
02:09:00,670 --> 02:09:01,270
We got this.

2971
02:09:01,550 --> 02:09:02,650
Open the case.

2972
02:09:04,670 --> 02:09:05,250
Ten!

2973
02:09:07,590 --> 02:09:08,170
Yeah!

2974
02:09:08,750 --> 02:09:13,480
Our offer's gonna shoot up, man!

2975
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:15,440
Our offer's gonna shoot to the stars!

2976
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:17,020
Yippee!

2977
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:18,360
Okay.

2978
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:19,900
Two cases left over.

2979
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:23,960
Ten has ten dollars.

2980
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:24,540
Trust for...

2981
02:09:24,540 --> 02:09:26,220
We just got rid of the ten dollars!

2982
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:27,900
You can't say that, Akiyama!

2983
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,100
You can't say that.

2984
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:34,440
If possible.

2985
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:36,460
We should do one of the custom games.

2986
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:37,300
Yeah, I wanna try.

2987
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:37,840
I wanna try.

2988
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:39,860
But I really wanna win the million dollars.

2989
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:41,040
Twenty?

2990
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:41,960
Okay, let's do twenty.

2991
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:45,320
A lot of people are saying twenty, but if it's bad...

2992
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:46,840
I'm gonna be really sad, you guys.

2993
02:09:46,940 --> 02:09:48,180
I'm not even gonna... I'm not gonna look.

2994
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:48,760
I'm not gonna look.

2995
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:51,560
Yay!

2996
02:10:02,050 --> 02:10:02,410
Okay.

2997
02:10:03,770 --> 02:10:04,490
One case.

2998
02:10:04,730 --> 02:10:05,610
Oh my god, the bug is back.

2999
02:10:05,790 --> 02:10:07,430
It's like a little gnat in my room.

3000
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:09,330
I hate summer because all the gnats come out.

3001
02:10:10,350 --> 02:10:10,710
Three?

3002
02:10:15,890 --> 02:10:17,890
I don't know, I feel like three is the one million.

3003
02:10:20,150 --> 02:10:21,090
Open the case.

3004
02:10:26,700 --> 02:10:28,640
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

3005
02:10:28,660 --> 02:10:30,120
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

3006
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:35,090
This is a really good run.

3007
02:10:35,190 --> 02:10:35,710
It is!

3008
02:10:35,710 --> 02:10:36,070
It is!

3009
02:10:36,190 --> 02:10:37,670
Our luck has turned around so much!

3010
02:10:38,690 --> 02:10:40,030
What do you think is gonna happen?

3011
02:10:40,210 --> 02:10:41,950
We're gonna get a super good deal.

3012
02:10:42,050 --> 02:10:43,790
The banker is molding up there.

3013
02:10:44,430 --> 02:10:44,870
Okay.

3014
02:10:46,510 --> 02:10:46,950
Okay.

3015
02:10:52,330 --> 02:10:53,550
The offer did go up.

3016
02:10:58,110 --> 02:10:59,590
But we're not gonna deal.

3017
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:00,150
Deal?

3018
02:11:00,150 --> 02:11:05,610
You guys, we still have five hundred, seven hundred fifty, and one million on the board.

3019
02:11:05,610 --> 02:11:08,030
Like, we are killing it right now.

3020
02:11:08,510 --> 02:11:09,430
No deal.

3021
02:11:10,090 --> 02:11:10,950
No deal.

3022
02:11:14,810 --> 02:11:15,670
No deal!

3023
02:11:23,770 --> 02:11:25,630
Two cases left open.

3024
02:11:26,430 --> 02:11:27,310
Two cases.

3025
02:11:28,970 --> 02:11:30,730
We have seventy-five and two hundred.

3026
02:11:31,010 --> 02:11:32,410
A thousand, ten thousand.

3027
02:11:32,750 --> 02:11:35,330
A hundred thousand, five hundred, seven fifty, one million.

3028
02:11:41,650 --> 02:11:43,190
Why are your eyebrows so thick?

3029
02:11:43,270 --> 02:11:44,430
No, it's a headband.

3030
02:11:44,590 --> 02:11:45,390
It's Solid Snake.

3031
02:11:46,030 --> 02:11:46,550
Number ten.

3032
02:11:49,290 --> 02:11:50,130
Number ten.

3033
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:54,150
I'm scared.

3034
02:11:54,490 --> 02:11:55,510
I'm so scared.

3035
02:11:57,770 --> 02:11:58,830
Okay, ten thousand.

3036
02:12:00,430 --> 02:12:01,770
Okay, okay, okay.

3037
02:12:02,830 --> 02:12:12,010
Remember this game started so bad with the two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, but now we're like, okay.

3038
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:21,420
I'm thinking eighteen.

3039
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:23,800
I'm thinking eighteen.

3040
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:26,320
Ten for ten K.

3041
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:27,500
Open the case.

3042
02:12:27,780 --> 02:12:28,900
Open the case.

3043
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:31,840
Oh,

3044
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:45,700
we already have a call.

3045
02:12:45,740 --> 02:12:46,460
Here comes the offer.

3046
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:47,740
Here comes the offer.

3047
02:12:48,380 --> 02:12:49,900
Oh, Howie, I'm scared.

3048
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:50,740
Hello.

3049
02:12:50,860 --> 02:12:51,380
Okay.

3050
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:52,500
Yeah.

3051
02:12:52,820 --> 02:12:53,340
Okay.

3052
02:12:53,480 --> 02:12:54,860
Talk dirty to me, banker.

3053
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:55,460
Okay.

3054
02:12:55,540 --> 02:12:56,780
I mean nasty to me.

3055
02:12:58,680 --> 02:12:59,920
The offer went down.

3056
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:02,200
Down?

3057
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:02,720
No.

3058
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:03,880
No deal.

3059
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:06,240
I still have one million on the board, mister.

3060
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:07,200
Deal?

3061
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:08,640
No, I'm not even gonna let you finish your sentence.

3062
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:15,320
No deal.

3063
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:16,380
No deal.

3064
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:17,520
No deal.

3065
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:18,380
No deal.

3066
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:22,140
We gotta get rid of the seventy five and two hundred, though.

3067
02:13:22,980 --> 02:13:23,660
Alright, guys.

3068
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:27,360
What do we pick?

3069
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:30,440
What do we pick?

3070
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:32,760
What do we pick?

3071
02:13:37,820 --> 02:13:38,220
Thirteen?

3072
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:38,360
Thirteen?

3073
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:42,040
I started watching YouTubers with you and Matara.

3074
02:13:42,280 --> 02:13:43,040
Wow, thank you.

3075
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:45,820
Now I am a henya simp, too.

3076
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:50,080
We got this next deal.

3077
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:50,400
Yeah.

3078
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:52,960
I'm also a henya simp.

3079
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:55,500
There's also fourteen.

3080
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:57,360
I'm gonna go with thirteen.

3081
02:14:03,220 --> 02:14:04,300
Open the case.

3082
02:14:21,410 --> 02:14:22,670
The offer went up.

3083
02:14:22,670 --> 02:14:23,910
What do you think is gonna happen?

3084
02:14:23,930 --> 02:14:24,650
It's gonna go up.

3085
02:14:24,650 --> 02:14:27,310
The banker is so salty right now.

3086
02:14:28,010 --> 02:14:29,470
He's like, screaming.

3087
02:14:31,570 --> 02:14:32,450
Oh, he's not.

3088
02:14:32,650 --> 02:14:33,990
Actually, he's not so salty.

3089
02:14:34,130 --> 02:14:34,730
Not yet.

3090
02:14:36,030 --> 02:14:37,290
The offer did go.

3091
02:14:37,530 --> 02:14:37,890
It did?

3092
02:14:39,050 --> 02:14:41,650
We still haven't reached four hundred thousand, though.

3093
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:43,210
No deal.

3094
02:14:47,770 --> 02:14:48,570
No deal.

3095
02:14:52,330 --> 02:14:53,970
You can't make me.

3096
02:14:54,310 --> 02:14:55,630
You can't make me.

3097
02:14:55,670 --> 02:14:58,270
Not with that million dollars still stuck up there on the board.

3098
02:14:59,510 --> 02:15:01,390
Okay, I'm gonna go with fourteen, then.

3099
02:15:03,530 --> 02:15:05,110
I'm gonna go with fourteen, you guys.

3100
02:15:10,210 --> 02:15:11,530
Open the case.

3101
02:15:17,910 --> 02:15:18,390
Guys?

3102
02:15:19,490 --> 02:15:19,970
Guys?

3103
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:30,760
What do you think is gonna happen?

3104
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:35,640
Okay.

3105
02:15:37,380 --> 02:15:37,820
Okay.

3106
02:15:39,200 --> 02:15:39,640
Okay.

3107
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:40,000
Okay.

3108
02:15:42,860 --> 02:15:43,800
It went up.

3109
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:45,040
Of course it did.

3110
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:47,480
Oh, shoot.

3111
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:50,240
I wanna take it so bad.

3112
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:52,520
I wanna take the deal so bad.

3113
02:15:57,860 --> 02:16:00,040
Yeah, next move will make or break for real.

3114
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:03,240
We still have the one million, though.

3115
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:09,040
And I said as long as there's still one million on the board, it is no deal, baby!

3116
02:16:09,740 --> 02:16:10,180
No!

3117
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:11,000
No!

3118
02:16:16,630 --> 02:16:17,950
One more case.

3119
02:16:18,330 --> 02:16:18,970
Oh, my God.

3120
02:16:19,250 --> 02:16:19,910
Oh, my God.

3121
02:16:23,350 --> 02:16:24,230
Oh, guys.

3122
02:16:24,510 --> 02:16:25,130
Oh, guys.

3123
02:16:25,170 --> 02:16:25,630
Oh, guys.

3124
02:16:25,650 --> 02:16:26,110
Oh, guys.

3125
02:16:26,110 --> 02:16:26,470
Oh, guys.

3126
02:16:26,590 --> 02:16:26,590
Oh, guys.

3127
02:16:26,610 --> 02:16:26,910
Oh, guys.

3128
02:16:26,910 --> 02:16:27,090
Oh, guys.

3129
02:16:34,090 --> 02:16:36,770
My stomach is hurting from the stress of it all.

3130
02:16:38,010 --> 02:16:38,850
Twenty-two.

3131
02:16:40,610 --> 02:16:42,070
I don't know about you.

3132
02:16:44,270 --> 02:16:46,510
I'm scared of twenty-two.

3133
02:16:49,270 --> 02:16:51,030
But it wasn't one million.

3134
02:16:52,170 --> 02:16:53,550
It wasn't one million.

3135
02:16:53,950 --> 02:16:55,190
It went down, but it...

3136
02:16:57,610 --> 02:16:59,030
I love your streams.

3137
02:16:59,250 --> 02:17:00,030
Thank you, Marcus.

3138
02:17:01,810 --> 02:17:03,170
Thank you so much for a super chat.

3139
02:17:03,170 --> 02:17:04,130
What do you think is gonna happen?

3140
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:06,170
Hello.

3141
02:17:08,510 --> 02:17:09,030
Okay.

3142
02:17:09,290 --> 02:17:09,810
Okay.

3143
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:11,110
Okay.

3144
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:11,650
Okay.

3145
02:17:12,490 --> 02:17:13,010
Right.

3146
02:17:13,250 --> 02:17:13,630
Okay.

3147
02:17:13,630 --> 02:17:13,970
Right.

3148
02:17:14,090 --> 02:17:14,350
Yeah.

3149
02:17:15,930 --> 02:17:17,430
The offer went down.

3150
02:17:19,630 --> 02:17:21,250
It went down quite a bit.

3151
02:17:22,330 --> 02:17:23,090
No deal.

3152
02:17:26,810 --> 02:17:30,090
I will take the L before I take the offer.

3153
02:17:31,550 --> 02:17:32,070
Nasty

3154
02:17:35,450 --> 02:17:35,830
banker.

3155
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:37,210
One more case.

3156
02:17:37,210 --> 02:17:38,110
Oh, my God.

3157
02:17:38,110 --> 02:17:38,810
Oh, my God.

3158
02:17:38,830 --> 02:17:39,210
You guys.

3159
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:41,930
My anxiety is so high right now.

3160
02:17:42,150 --> 02:17:42,850
I don't know.

3161
02:17:43,470 --> 02:17:44,430
Sixteen or twenty-four.

3162
02:17:44,510 --> 02:17:45,150
What do I do?

3163
02:17:46,950 --> 02:17:48,090
Oh, my God.

3164
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:48,790
Oh, my God.

3165
02:17:48,830 --> 02:17:49,290
Oh, my God.

3166
02:17:49,290 --> 02:17:49,770
Oh, my God.

3167
02:17:49,790 --> 02:17:50,250
Oh, my God.

3168
02:17:50,250 --> 02:17:50,650
Oh, my God.

3169
02:17:50,730 --> 02:17:51,150
Oh, my God.

3170
02:17:53,530 --> 02:17:54,250
Oh, my God.

3171
02:17:54,250 --> 02:17:54,790
Sweet sixteen.

3172
02:17:56,010 --> 02:17:56,710
I'm scared.

3173
02:17:56,730 --> 02:17:57,330
I'm scared.

3174
02:17:57,370 --> 02:17:57,810
I'm scared.

3175
02:17:57,850 --> 02:17:58,590
Twenty-four.

3176
02:17:59,570 --> 02:17:59,930
Sixteen.

3177
02:18:00,430 --> 02:18:01,110
Twenty-four.

3178
02:18:01,630 --> 02:18:01,990
Sixteen.

3179
02:18:03,590 --> 02:18:03,950
Sixteen.

3180
02:18:08,810 --> 02:18:09,670
I can't look.

3181
02:18:09,830 --> 02:18:10,090
Open the case.

3182
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:28,930
What do you think is going to happen?

3183
02:18:32,290 --> 02:18:32,730
Hello.

3184
02:18:33,390 --> 02:18:33,830
Okay.

3185
02:18:34,570 --> 02:18:35,490
What do I do?

3186
02:18:37,470 --> 02:18:37,910
Okay.

3187
02:18:39,370 --> 02:18:40,830
The offer is going to be insane.

3188
02:18:41,150 --> 02:18:42,490
The offer did go.

3189
02:18:42,910 --> 02:18:44,110
The offer is going to...

3190
02:18:44,110 --> 02:18:45,170
Oh, my God.

3191
02:18:45,210 --> 02:18:46,410
It's actually insane.

3192
02:18:47,370 --> 02:18:48,090
No deal.

3193
02:18:48,690 --> 02:18:49,130
No deal.

3194
02:18:49,230 --> 02:18:50,390
No deal.

3195
02:18:53,050 --> 02:18:53,910
Oh, my God.

3196
02:18:54,030 --> 02:18:56,470
Did I actually pick the one million dollar case?

3197
02:18:56,570 --> 02:18:57,290
There's no way.

3198
02:18:57,690 --> 02:18:58,710
There's no way.

3199
02:18:59,350 --> 02:19:00,250
There's no way.

3200
02:19:00,310 --> 02:19:01,930
Did I pick the one million dollar case?

3201
02:19:02,310 --> 02:19:03,170
You guys.

3202
02:19:03,330 --> 02:19:04,090
You guys.

3203
02:19:04,130 --> 02:19:04,570
You guys.

3204
02:19:04,670 --> 02:19:05,030
You guys.

3205
02:19:05,590 --> 02:19:06,930
You want to switch cases?

3206
02:19:07,130 --> 02:19:07,990
Oh, my God.

3207
02:19:10,190 --> 02:19:10,970
No swap.

3208
02:19:11,490 --> 02:19:12,310
No swap.

3209
02:19:12,390 --> 02:19:13,150
We're doubling down.

3210
02:19:13,470 --> 02:19:15,150
I believe in case eight.

3211
02:19:15,970 --> 02:19:16,770
I believe.

3212
02:19:18,690 --> 02:19:19,010
Please.

3213
02:19:21,470 --> 02:19:22,110
Please.

3214
02:19:23,030 --> 02:19:23,670
It

3215
02:19:44,050 --> 02:19:46,250
was right there in front of me.

3216
02:19:46,390 --> 02:19:47,150
It was.

3217
02:19:47,290 --> 02:19:48,350
It was.

3218
02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:50,410
It was right there.

3219
02:19:51,650 --> 02:19:53,010
In front of me.

3220
02:20:02,890 --> 02:20:03,530
One.

3221
02:20:04,870 --> 02:20:07,110
It was the closest we'll ever get.

3222
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:07,570
It was the closest we'll ever get.

3223
02:20:07,570 --> 02:20:07,750
Hold on.

3224
02:20:07,790 --> 02:20:08,830
My YouTube just froze.

3225
02:20:08,910 --> 02:20:09,850
I can't read the chat.

3226
02:20:12,530 --> 02:20:13,170
Ah.

3227
02:20:13,870 --> 02:20:14,510
Ah.

3228
02:20:15,630 --> 02:20:16,450
You guys.

3229
02:20:17,630 --> 02:20:18,590
You guys.

3230
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:35,600
One second.

3231
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:36,020
Oh, my.

3232
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:37,220
Hold on.

3233
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:38,160
Because I am...

3234
02:20:38,980 --> 02:20:39,680
Hold on.

3235
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:42,420
I have to change my screen a little bit around.

3236
02:20:52,070 --> 02:20:55,670
You guys we were so close to the one million dollar.

3237
02:20:57,930 --> 02:20:59,650
You guys we were so close.

3238
02:21:00,230 --> 02:21:01,790
You guys we were so close.

3239
02:21:01,790 --> 02:21:02,150
So close!

3240
02:21:02,890 --> 02:21:04,430
It was right there.

3241
02:21:04,710 --> 02:21:07,750
It was my lucky number not to ruin for me.

3242
02:21:08,350 --> 02:21:09,710
Let's change the settings.

3243
02:21:10,210 --> 02:21:11,830
We got so close there.

3244
02:21:12,030 --> 02:21:14,790
We got actually so close that I'm like...

3245
02:21:16,390 --> 02:21:18,190
Oh my gosh.

3246
02:21:18,630 --> 02:21:21,090
That was like probably the best game I'll ever have ever.

3247
02:21:24,490 --> 02:21:27,430
I've never seen anyone so sad about winning 100k.

3248
02:21:28,450 --> 02:21:31,090
I know, but when it was that compared to 1 million!

3249
02:21:31,970 --> 02:21:33,930
We need to add a pity system to this game.

3250
02:21:34,110 --> 02:21:35,550
I thought they also said...

3251
02:21:35,550 --> 02:21:37,570
I feel like if the 1 million is on the board...

3252
02:21:37,570 --> 02:21:38,110
Oh wait!

3253
02:21:38,210 --> 02:21:38,850
Oh my bad.

3254
02:21:38,950 --> 02:21:39,390
Oh my goodness.

3255
02:21:39,530 --> 02:21:39,930
Wait, hold on.

3256
02:21:41,890 --> 02:21:42,250
Wait!

3257
02:21:42,470 --> 02:21:43,150
No, ladies!

3258
02:21:43,650 --> 02:21:44,990
I didn't want to do another game.

3259
02:21:45,050 --> 02:21:46,170
I wanted to change the settings.

3260
02:21:48,630 --> 02:21:52,030
Seeing your luck with money, I wanted to send you this pity super chat.

3261
02:21:53,790 --> 02:21:54,810
Thank you, Takedo.

3262
02:21:57,690 --> 02:21:58,550
Oh, green!

3263
02:21:59,850 --> 02:22:02,290
Oh my god, you can really see their cleavage this time.

3264
02:22:03,810 --> 02:22:04,690
Hi, how...

3265
02:22:09,340 --> 02:22:10,100
Hello, ladies.

3266
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:12,380
Hi, how...

3267
02:22:13,500 --> 02:22:15,300
Oh, I love them!

3268
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:17,340
Please say hello to our next player.

3269
02:22:17,700 --> 02:22:18,520
Get me out of here.

3270
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:20,420
Pick a case.

3271
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:21,000
No!

3272
02:22:21,220 --> 02:22:22,540
Wait, how do I actually leave?

3273
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:25,780
How do I leave?

3274
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:26,940
There's... how do I...

3275
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:28,160
Oh, here we go.

3276
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:28,720
Okay, quit.

3277
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:31,000
Quit.

3278
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,820
I want to change the settings, guys.

3279
02:22:34,460 --> 02:22:35,180
Let's see.

3280
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:36,460
Maybe custom game.

3281
02:22:36,700 --> 02:22:37,940
What kind of custom is it?

3282
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:41,340
Special event.

3283
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:43,040
Oh, include minigames.

3284
02:22:43,420 --> 02:22:44,020
Yes.

3285
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:46,660
Million dollar mission.

3286
02:22:47,220 --> 02:22:47,660
Two!

3287
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:48,500
Wait.

3288
02:22:48,760 --> 02:22:50,140
Set million dollar mission.

3289
02:22:50,540 --> 02:22:52,320
Choose the number of million dollar cases.

3290
02:22:54,220 --> 02:22:54,820
My

3291
02:22:57,920 --> 02:22:59,480
luck can't be that bad, right?

3292
02:23:00,320 --> 02:23:01,740
Higher top value.

3293
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:03,640
Double dollar value.

3294
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:05,120
Double or nothing.

3295
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:06,560
Random.

3296
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:14,860
Two players?

3297
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:18,020
Uh-oh, we're going against the CPU, you guys.

3298
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:19,600
I'm kind of scared.

3299
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:22,720
Wait.

3300
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:25,260
The CPU is probably going to win, right?

3301
02:23:26,020 --> 02:23:28,120
Cheating ghost, but they allowed me to!

3302
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:35,880
How does this game have multiplayer?

3303
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:36,840
I have no idea.

3304
02:23:41,730 --> 02:23:44,130
Hello and welcome to Deal or No Deal.

3305
02:23:44,250 --> 02:23:45,250
I'm Howie Mandel.

3306
02:23:45,330 --> 02:23:46,310
Hi, Howie Mandel.

3307
02:23:46,410 --> 02:23:46,650
Hi.

3308
02:23:46,870 --> 02:23:48,930
Today's special, special episode.

3309
02:23:49,690 --> 02:23:50,930
Ladies, please.

3310
02:23:51,390 --> 02:23:52,790
The board.

3311
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:57,440
What color?

3312
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:00,040
Just like my ribbon!

3313
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:02,260
Yup.

3314
02:24:06,830 --> 02:24:08,330
I'll cheer for CPU.

3315
02:24:08,610 --> 02:24:09,590
Why do you hate me?

3316
02:24:10,950 --> 02:24:12,210
Why do you hate me?

3317
02:24:18,910 --> 02:24:19,950
Why do you hate me?

3318
02:24:20,190 --> 02:24:20,570
Hello, ladies.

3319
02:24:21,870 --> 02:24:22,910
Hi, Howie.

3320
02:24:23,970 --> 02:24:25,510
Oh, I love that.

3321
02:24:26,290 --> 02:24:27,850
Please say hello to our next player.

3322
02:24:28,270 --> 02:24:28,930
It's me.

3323
02:24:31,890 --> 02:24:32,410
And...

3324
02:24:34,730 --> 02:24:35,250
CPU?

3325
02:24:37,050 --> 02:24:37,570
What?

3326
02:24:37,690 --> 02:24:40,310
We got 26 lovely ladies holding 26 cases.

3327
02:24:40,310 --> 02:24:41,170
Wait, where's CPU?

3328
02:24:41,350 --> 02:24:44,150
Each of those cases is holding a random amount of money placed there by a third party.

3329
02:24:44,410 --> 02:24:45,610
We don't know what's in what case.

3330
02:24:45,710 --> 02:24:51,030
But we do know one case is holding one million dollars.

3331
02:24:51,190 --> 02:24:53,890
I thought he was going to say 13 cases.

3332
02:25:00,690 --> 02:25:03,970
I will go with whatever is in my case, you guys.

3333
02:25:04,150 --> 02:25:07,950
I am not... I will go with whatever is in my case, okay?

3334
02:25:08,110 --> 02:25:11,250
I basically have a 50-50 chance of...

3335
02:25:11,250 --> 02:25:12,550
I will... I will...

3336
02:25:13,370 --> 02:25:15,110
I will not back down.

3337
02:25:15,310 --> 02:25:17,770
If I lose the million, I lose the money.

3338
02:25:17,770 --> 02:25:18,210
I lose the million.

3339
02:25:18,510 --> 02:25:21,290
And we are going with number four, I think.

3340
02:25:21,810 --> 02:25:22,270
Maybe.

3341
02:25:22,470 --> 02:25:23,150
Actually, I don't know.

3342
02:25:23,830 --> 02:25:25,050
I counted at the math.

3343
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:26,290
It's not Monty Hall.

3344
02:25:26,430 --> 02:25:28,470
It's actually 50-50.

3345
02:25:28,730 --> 02:25:30,110
So I might as well swap anyway.

3346
02:25:30,310 --> 02:25:31,110
Unless you lose it.

3347
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:31,530
Yeah.

3348
02:25:38,550 --> 02:25:39,830
Actually, I'm going to make it random.

3349
02:25:39,970 --> 02:25:40,890
I'm going to close my eyes.

3350
02:25:41,290 --> 02:25:44,150
And if you close your eyes...

3351
02:25:44,150 --> 02:25:48,810
You will almost feel one million dollars.

3352
02:25:52,270 --> 02:25:53,030
Number 11.

3353
02:25:56,530 --> 02:25:56,930
Abby.

3354
02:25:57,210 --> 02:25:58,170
Bomb Abby.

3355
02:26:00,570 --> 02:26:03,510
That's your case to keep, to take home, to spend.

3356
02:26:03,530 --> 02:26:04,310
Do whatever you want.

3357
02:26:04,370 --> 02:26:06,070
Unless you should decide to sell it.

3358
02:26:06,850 --> 02:26:08,650
Let's find out if you got a million dollars in there.

3359
02:26:08,650 --> 02:26:10,230
Yeah, every time I swap, it's bad.

3360
02:26:10,370 --> 02:26:12,110
And every time I don't swap, it's bad.

3361
02:26:12,730 --> 02:26:13,330
All right.

3362
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:15,270
We are going to start with number four.

3363
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:16,330
Lucky number four.

3364
02:26:17,790 --> 02:26:18,830
Here we go, baby.

3365
02:26:19,850 --> 02:26:20,510
Open the case.

3366
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:22,050
We are picking Galen now.

3367
02:26:24,030 --> 02:26:24,570
25.

3368
02:26:27,550 --> 02:26:28,830
Oh, we are grooving.

3369
02:26:29,010 --> 02:26:30,050
We are schmoving.

3370
02:26:31,150 --> 02:26:32,370
Oh, we are grooving.

3371
02:26:35,470 --> 02:26:37,490
You guys, this is a true test of my luck.

3372
02:26:37,690 --> 02:26:39,150
Five cases to open.

3373
02:26:41,130 --> 02:26:42,210
Um, 13.

3374
02:26:42,890 --> 02:26:43,910
Lucky number 13.

3375
02:26:44,350 --> 02:26:47,350
Actually, I should go for six because they always screw me over.

3376
02:26:47,590 --> 02:26:48,130
Open the case.

3377
02:26:48,130 --> 02:26:48,430
Open the case.

3378
02:26:49,370 --> 02:26:49,910
400.

3379
02:26:50,130 --> 02:26:50,670
400.

3380
02:26:50,670 --> 02:26:51,130
Okay.

3381
02:26:51,870 --> 02:26:52,410
So, we are going to pick Galen.

3382
02:26:52,430 --> 02:26:53,990
You guys, are we killin' it or what?

3383
02:26:58,950 --> 02:27:01,130
I think we're doing really awesome.

3384
02:27:02,570 --> 02:27:04,650
I don't understand what the game mode is though.

3385
02:27:04,730 --> 02:27:05,730
It seems the exact same.

3386
02:27:06,570 --> 02:27:08,910
Number 6 has 1 million in it.

3387
02:27:09,990 --> 02:27:12,890
I need you to get Howie Mandel the guest on StarHustle.

3388
02:27:13,090 --> 02:27:14,350
I don't think so.

3389
02:27:15,930 --> 02:27:16,390
What?!

3390
02:27:26,370 --> 02:27:27,950
You guys, how is this possible?

3391
02:27:29,350 --> 02:27:30,830
Okay, 3 cases left open.

3392
02:27:31,910 --> 02:27:33,110
Guys, how is this possible?

3393
02:27:33,830 --> 02:27:34,910
Okay, you pick the next one.

3394
02:27:34,950 --> 02:27:35,610
You pick the next one.

3395
02:27:35,650 --> 02:27:36,290
You pick the next one.

3396
02:27:36,330 --> 02:27:36,930
You pick the next one.

3397
02:27:40,790 --> 02:27:41,110
9?

3398
02:27:41,250 --> 02:27:42,370
I saw 9 first.

3399
02:27:42,670 --> 02:27:43,310
Like turtles.

3400
02:27:45,410 --> 02:27:45,730
You.

3401
02:27:47,650 --> 02:27:47,970
9.

3402
02:27:48,730 --> 02:27:49,490
Open the case.

3403
02:27:54,850 --> 02:27:57,370
Our first 1 million down!

3404
02:28:05,150 --> 02:28:06,970
2 cases left open.

3405
02:28:10,190 --> 02:28:11,790
Suspiciously, we're gonna go for number 1.

3406
02:28:15,810 --> 02:28:16,290
17?

3407
02:28:16,530 --> 02:28:18,130
Okay, we'll go with number 17 next.

3408
02:28:29,270 --> 02:28:29,750
Sorry.

3409
02:28:30,070 --> 02:28:30,830
No, turtles!

3410
02:28:30,990 --> 02:28:31,690
It's all good.

3411
02:28:32,270 --> 02:28:33,370
It's all good.

3412
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:33,990
One more case.

3413
02:28:34,210 --> 02:28:34,950
Alright, 17.

3414
02:28:35,290 --> 02:28:35,930
Someone said.

3415
02:28:36,550 --> 02:28:38,010
Thank you for the pink though.

3416
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:39,130
You didn't have to do that.

3417
02:28:40,550 --> 02:28:41,150
Here we go.

3418
02:28:41,150 --> 02:28:41,890
Here we go, Veronica!

3419
02:28:42,350 --> 02:28:43,030
Open your case.

3420
02:28:49,450 --> 02:28:49,910
It's okay.

3421
02:28:50,010 --> 02:28:51,950
We have 9 left, I think.

3422
02:28:53,890 --> 02:28:54,770
Oh, 10 left.

3423
02:28:59,170 --> 02:29:00,190
3 in a row.

3424
02:29:00,330 --> 02:29:01,870
Man in this room with just 1 job.

3425
02:29:01,990 --> 02:29:03,090
And it's a nasty job.

3426
02:29:03,210 --> 02:29:06,310
And his job is to get you out of here for as little as possible.

3427
02:29:06,470 --> 02:29:07,410
He's looking at the board.

3428
02:29:07,510 --> 02:29:08,190
He's looking at you.

3429
02:29:08,230 --> 02:29:09,030
And he wants to buy that case for as little as possible.

3430
02:29:09,030 --> 02:29:11,190
You guys, do you think I have a million in my case?

3431
02:29:11,250 --> 02:29:11,350
He's working it out.

3432
02:29:11,350 --> 02:29:12,270
That's the banker right there.

3433
02:29:12,310 --> 02:29:14,070
He's gonna call me and make you an offer right now.

3434
02:29:14,070 --> 02:29:16,430
Do you think I have 1 million in my case right now?

3435
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:19,170
What do you think's gonna happen?

3436
02:29:20,590 --> 02:29:21,030
No!

3437
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:22,970
Hello.

3438
02:29:23,690 --> 02:29:24,130
Okay.

3439
02:29:25,650 --> 02:29:26,090
Right.

3440
02:29:27,190 --> 02:29:29,310
Surely you can get 13 in a row.

3441
02:29:31,310 --> 02:29:32,290
The new offer.

3442
02:29:34,770 --> 02:29:35,210
Wowee!

3443
02:29:35,210 --> 02:29:38,850
This is the highest offer I think we'll ever get in the first time.

3444
02:29:38,850 --> 02:29:39,590
Deal or no deal?

3445
02:29:39,810 --> 02:29:40,350
No deal.

3446
02:29:40,630 --> 02:29:42,550
There's still a million on the board, obviously.

3447
02:29:44,450 --> 02:29:47,990
I have 1 cent.

3448
02:29:48,730 --> 02:29:56,850
If I have a single penny in my... in my... in my case, I will... I will go akasupa someone right now.

3449
02:29:57,390 --> 02:29:58,370
Actually, quick idea.

3450
02:29:58,510 --> 02:30:00,130
I would love to see Mint play as the banker.

3451
02:30:01,090 --> 02:30:01,970
That'd be so fun.

3452
02:30:04,270 --> 02:30:04,750
25.

3453
02:30:10,770 --> 02:30:11,590
Open your case.

3454
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:12,050
Come on, Alexis.

3455
02:30:15,290 --> 02:30:15,970
It's okay.

3456
02:30:18,150 --> 02:30:18,650
It's fine.

3457
02:30:27,260 --> 02:30:28,400
Four more cases.

3458
02:30:35,450 --> 02:30:42,170
And I think I will cry if I actually lose this because this is just... just a testament of my life.

3459
02:30:42,450 --> 02:30:43,510
My afterlife.

3460
02:30:44,050 --> 02:30:44,910
My everything.

3461
02:30:45,110 --> 02:30:46,290
My entire being.

3462
02:30:46,430 --> 02:30:46,650
Open your case.

3463
02:30:46,750 --> 02:30:47,670
When I was alive.

3464
02:30:48,490 --> 02:30:49,490
Get out.

3465
02:30:50,650 --> 02:30:51,490
Get out.

3466
02:30:51,910 --> 02:30:52,530
I'm talking

3467
02:31:01,490 --> 02:31:02,150
to you guys.

3468
02:31:02,230 --> 02:31:04,450
I think I'm gonna... I think I'm gonna...

3469
02:31:04,450 --> 02:31:05,090
Okay.

3470
02:31:05,310 --> 02:31:05,870
Three cases left.

3471
02:31:07,770 --> 02:31:08,790
Oh, God.

3472
02:31:08,950 --> 02:31:11,030
I think I'm worried, you guys.

3473
02:31:11,310 --> 02:31:12,530
I think I'm worried.

3474
02:31:13,790 --> 02:31:14,910
Oh, no.

3475
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,400
Open the case.

3476
02:31:24,740 --> 02:31:26,120
This is the next level.

3477
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:41,500
Two cases left open.

3478
02:31:42,820 --> 02:31:43,420
I

3479
02:31:49,400 --> 02:31:50,800
picked number 10, okay?

3480
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:52,280
You guys are bad.

3481
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:55,640
Open the case.

3482
02:32:00,020 --> 02:32:01,140
That wasn't me.

3483
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:01,960
That was you guys.

3484
02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:11,880
One more.

3485
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:12,860
My stomach hurts.

3486
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:13,380
Please.

3487
02:32:17,420 --> 02:32:18,180
The

3488
02:32:27,810 --> 02:32:29,670
hierarchy for anti-gambling.

3489
02:32:32,820 --> 02:32:33,500
Oh, God.

3490
02:32:34,060 --> 02:32:35,600
My stomach hurts.

3491
02:32:35,820 --> 02:32:37,320
I don't know about you.

3492
02:32:38,820 --> 02:32:40,380
I'm feeling 22.

3493
02:32:44,500 --> 02:32:45,260
Please.

3494
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:46,460
Open the case.

3495
02:32:47,740 --> 02:32:48,500
Oh.

3496
02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:49,200
Oh.

3497
02:32:50,220 --> 02:32:51,600
We broke the streak.

3498
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:53,960
Oh, my goodness gracious.

3499
02:32:54,220 --> 02:32:56,440
If it was another million, I don't know what I...

3500
02:33:02,320 --> 02:33:03,640
I'm still scared.

3501
02:33:04,040 --> 02:33:07,520
Our offer is gonna be such a dog shit, you guys.

3502
02:33:10,060 --> 02:33:10,580
Okay.

3503
02:33:12,300 --> 02:33:12,820
Okay.

3504
02:33:14,280 --> 02:33:14,800
Okay.

3505
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:16,220
Oh, God.

3506
02:33:17,960 --> 02:33:19,160
The offer went down.

3507
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:20,760
Of course it did.

3508
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:23,800
But we still have a million on the board.

3509
02:33:23,800 --> 02:33:24,720
It's a deal.

3510
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:32,940
I'm so sorry.

3511
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:34,060
The best worst luck ever.

3512
02:33:34,380 --> 02:33:35,460
This is like...

3513
02:33:35,460 --> 02:33:37,400
If anyone is ever just like, man.

3514
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:41,120
Mint is not very lucky.

3515
02:33:41,260 --> 02:33:42,180
Like, are you...

3516
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:45,760
This is just a testament to my luck.

3517
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:46,100
Okay.

3518
02:33:46,340 --> 02:33:48,080
I have negative luck stat.

3519
02:33:50,100 --> 02:33:51,140
Oh gosh.

3520
02:33:51,220 --> 02:33:52,020
I'm gonna go with three.

3521
02:33:56,240 --> 02:33:57,400
Oh, just like you Michael.

3522
02:33:57,400 --> 02:33:57,900
Let's go.

3523
02:33:58,380 --> 02:33:59,060
All right.

3524
02:33:59,180 --> 02:33:59,860
Open the case.

3525
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:00,940
Please open the case.

3526
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:01,640
Please open the case.

3527
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:01,800
Oh, gosh.

3528
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:02,240
Two hundred!

3529
02:34:05,780 --> 02:34:07,920
I just want to win with one milli.

3530
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:17,550
We're sticking with our eleven now.

3531
02:34:17,650 --> 02:34:18,370
We're sticking with eleven.

3532
02:34:18,990 --> 02:34:19,970
I'm gonna go with two.

3533
02:34:21,810 --> 02:34:24,350
I know Min's trying to buy more Metal Gear merch.

3534
02:34:24,530 --> 02:34:25,570
He didn't win that milli.

3535
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:27,010
Open the case.

3536
02:34:31,290 --> 02:34:31,890
It's okay.

3537
02:34:31,990 --> 02:34:32,970
There's still a couple left.

3538
02:34:33,490 --> 02:34:34,170
That's alright!

3539
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:42,200
There's still five million left, no worries!

3540
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:44,260
Two cases left over.

3541
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:45,120
I'm gonna go with five.

3542
02:34:45,280 --> 02:34:48,040
Let's just knock out the entire first row.

3543
02:34:48,220 --> 02:34:49,000
Let's just take it out.

3544
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:51,120
Camille, come on, Camille.

3545
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:51,340
Open the case.

3546
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:52,980
Camille, come on, Camille.

3547
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:54,320
A hundred!

3548
02:34:56,620 --> 02:34:58,940
If we have a dollar...

3549
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:00,860
Oh god.

3550
02:35:03,720 --> 02:35:04,200
Okay.

3551
02:35:04,980 --> 02:35:06,960
Okay, I know you guys are rooting for my daughter.

3552
02:35:06,980 --> 02:35:07,940
Downfall, but please.

3553
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:09,940
I'm gonna go for twenty.

3554
02:35:14,320 --> 02:35:15,140
Open the case.

3555
02:35:17,420 --> 02:35:18,140
Three hundred!

3556
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:21,400
Okay.

3557
02:35:21,540 --> 02:35:22,720
Our offer might even go up.

3558
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:25,860
That wasn't so bad.

3559
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:26,840
That wasn't...

3560
02:35:30,320 --> 02:35:31,980
We're rooting for CPU.

3561
02:35:32,260 --> 02:35:33,200
Where is that guy?

3562
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:34,400
Here comes the offer.

3563
02:35:35,360 --> 02:35:37,780
What if he was in the audience, like, staring?

3564
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:38,240
Hello.

3565
02:35:38,660 --> 02:35:39,140
Hello.

3566
02:35:39,140 --> 02:35:39,360
Okay.

3567
02:35:40,860 --> 02:35:41,340
Okay.

3568
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:42,080
Yeah.

3569
02:35:42,900 --> 02:35:43,380
Okay.

3570
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:43,660
Yeah.

3571
02:35:46,660 --> 02:35:47,660
It went up.

3572
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:49,540
Nice.

3573
02:35:51,100 --> 02:35:52,760
But I believe in number eleven.

3574
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:55,600
Oh gosh.

3575
02:35:55,820 --> 02:35:56,400
Oh golly.

3576
02:35:56,400 --> 02:35:56,880
What do I do?

3577
02:35:57,340 --> 02:35:58,340
Oh, I don't know.

3578
02:35:59,180 --> 02:35:59,760
Doubt it.

3579
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:02,320
Okay,

3580
02:36:08,350 --> 02:36:09,370
three cases left over.

3581
02:36:09,890 --> 02:36:11,190
Three cases left.

3582
02:36:11,530 --> 02:36:12,990
Good night and good luck, Minto.

3583
02:36:13,070 --> 02:36:13,590
Thanks, Jessie!

3584
02:36:15,790 --> 02:36:16,270
Okay.

3585
02:36:16,410 --> 02:36:16,810
Okay.

3586
02:36:19,890 --> 02:36:20,410
Twenty-six.

3587
02:36:23,250 --> 02:36:24,210
Twenty-six.

3588
02:36:24,330 --> 02:36:25,330
Twenty-six.

3589
02:36:26,730 --> 02:36:27,570
Open the case.

3590
02:36:27,670 --> 02:36:28,190
Open the case.

3591
02:36:30,650 --> 02:36:32,850
The dollar is out, you guys.

3592
02:36:33,030 --> 02:36:34,410
The dollar is out!

3593
02:36:39,750 --> 02:36:42,870
Who would have thought it would be this hard to get one million?

3594
02:36:42,870 --> 02:36:44,430
Two cases left over.

3595
02:36:44,850 --> 02:36:46,770
I'm gonna get rid of the second row as well.

3596
02:36:49,850 --> 02:36:50,330
Two cases left over.

3597
02:36:51,410 --> 02:36:52,170
Open the case.

3598
02:36:52,250 --> 02:36:52,710
Open the case.

3599
02:36:54,410 --> 02:36:55,190
Five hundred.

3600
02:37:01,940 --> 02:37:03,360
Our deal is gonna go up.

3601
02:37:03,380 --> 02:37:04,660
Our deal is gonna go way up.

3602
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:08,540
One case.

3603
02:37:08,940 --> 02:37:09,680
Number eight.

3604
02:37:10,900 --> 02:37:11,340
Okay.

3605
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:13,920
One case.

3606
02:37:13,940 --> 02:37:14,460
Number eight.

3607
02:37:14,600 --> 02:37:14,780
Open the case.

3608
02:37:16,600 --> 02:37:17,180
Seventy-five.

3609
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:20,580
I can't even imagine what our offer is going to be.

3610
02:37:23,020 --> 02:37:23,460
Okay.

3611
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:26,180
Look has changed.

3612
02:37:28,180 --> 02:37:29,780
Our luck has changed, everybody.

3613
02:37:32,020 --> 02:37:33,180
Here comes the offer.

3614
02:37:35,480 --> 02:37:36,520
He's mauling?

3615
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:37,860
He's raging?

3616
02:37:38,100 --> 02:37:38,360
Okay.

3617
02:37:39,700 --> 02:37:40,220
Okay.

3618
02:37:40,240 --> 02:37:40,680
Okay.

3619
02:37:40,680 --> 02:37:41,440
Yeah, okay.

3620
02:37:41,740 --> 02:37:42,260
Right.

3621
02:37:42,420 --> 02:37:43,120
Yeah, right.

3622
02:37:43,260 --> 02:37:43,660
Mm-hmm.

3623
02:37:43,660 --> 02:37:43,940
Yeah.

3624
02:37:44,040 --> 02:37:44,280
Ooh.

3625
02:37:44,400 --> 02:37:44,720
Yeah.

3626
02:37:44,820 --> 02:37:46,640
The offer did go.

3627
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:49,620
Not even 400k?

3628
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:50,620
Come on.

3629
02:37:50,820 --> 02:37:52,600
Not even 400k.

3630
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:52,920
No deal.

3631
02:37:55,340 --> 02:37:57,000
Not even 400k.

3632
02:37:57,200 --> 02:37:58,120
That's ridiculous.

3633
02:37:58,940 --> 02:37:59,880
That's so ridiculous.

3634
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:03,780
I think we're so stingy.

3635
02:38:03,780 --> 02:38:04,340
I know, right?

3636
02:38:06,940 --> 02:38:08,860
Imagine he offers you more than a million.

3637
02:38:09,900 --> 02:38:10,860
Let's go with 19.

3638
02:38:12,740 --> 02:38:15,360
Our girl, Janine, never lets us down.

3639
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:17,600
Open the case.

3640
02:38:32,070 --> 02:38:32,870
Oh, God.

3641
02:38:33,090 --> 02:38:33,590
One more case.

3642
02:38:35,230 --> 02:38:36,070
Number 16.

3643
02:38:36,090 --> 02:38:36,170
Oh, Jesus.

3644
02:38:41,060 --> 02:38:41,660
Melanie.

3645
02:38:42,060 --> 02:38:42,700
Open the case.

3646
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:45,080
750?

3647
02:38:49,250 --> 02:38:51,850
Guys, how is there still one cent on the board?

3648
02:39:00,010 --> 02:39:01,850
What do you think's gonna happen?

3649
02:39:01,870 --> 02:39:03,110
I don't know.

3650
02:39:04,930 --> 02:39:05,530
Hello.

3651
02:39:06,090 --> 02:39:06,690
Okay.

3652
02:39:08,170 --> 02:39:08,770
Okay.

3653
02:39:10,090 --> 02:39:10,690
Okay.

3654
02:39:10,690 --> 02:39:10,870
Okay.

3655
02:39:14,190 --> 02:39:15,150
New offer?

3656
02:39:15,290 --> 02:39:16,230
New offer, yeah.

3657
02:39:18,110 --> 02:39:18,590
What?

3658
02:39:18,730 --> 02:39:19,530
It went down?

3659
02:39:19,970 --> 02:39:20,750
No way.

3660
02:39:20,970 --> 02:39:21,770
Wait, did it actually...

3661
02:39:21,770 --> 02:39:22,450
Deal or no deal?

3662
02:39:22,550 --> 02:39:22,910
No deal.

3663
02:39:23,050 --> 02:39:24,110
Why did it go down?

3664
02:39:27,450 --> 02:39:29,610
This banker is so stingy.

3665
02:39:32,850 --> 02:39:36,290
I know we lost one million, but, like, come on.

3666
02:39:37,890 --> 02:39:38,910
One more case.

3667
02:39:39,650 --> 02:39:40,810
I'm gonna do 18.

3668
02:39:46,510 --> 02:39:47,510
Open the case.

3669
02:39:47,570 --> 02:39:48,350
Open the case.

3670
02:39:49,650 --> 02:39:50,510
There you go.

3671
02:39:50,670 --> 02:39:50,850
Here

3672
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:06,680
comes the offer.

3673
02:40:06,680 --> 02:40:07,420
A dollar versus a million.

3674
02:40:07,720 --> 02:40:08,880
I mean, not even a dollar.

3675
02:40:08,940 --> 02:40:11,340
It's a penny versus a million.

3676
02:40:11,340 --> 02:40:11,360
Hello.

3677
02:40:11,360 --> 02:40:11,500
Right.

3678
02:40:13,240 --> 02:40:13,720
Okay.

3679
02:40:15,450 --> 02:40:15,750
Really?

3680
02:40:15,910 --> 02:40:16,610
I cannot.

3681
02:40:16,690 --> 02:40:18,070
I can't with this.

3682
02:40:19,250 --> 02:40:19,730
Okay.

3683
02:40:19,770 --> 02:40:20,110
Line up.

3684
02:40:20,310 --> 02:40:20,670
No.

3685
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:25,280
You guys.

3686
02:40:25,820 --> 02:40:26,500
This is...

3687
02:40:26,500 --> 02:40:27,480
Deal or no deal?

3688
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:27,580
This is...

3689
02:40:27,580 --> 02:40:28,980
This is an insane deal.

3690
02:40:29,280 --> 02:40:30,220
This is insane.

3691
02:40:32,500 --> 02:40:33,460
Holy cow.

3692
02:40:50,260 --> 02:40:51,100
One kiss.

3693
02:40:51,900 --> 02:40:53,680
It sounds like you said one kiss.

3694
02:40:54,680 --> 02:40:56,780
What are you trying to say, Howie Mendo?

3695
02:40:57,200 --> 02:40:59,240
If I get to kiss one of these lovely ladies...

3696
02:40:59,240 --> 02:41:00,340
Oh, there's a spider on my wall.

3697
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:01,800
Go away.

3698
02:41:03,820 --> 02:41:05,060
I hate summertime.

3699
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:10,060
Oh, my gosh.

3700
02:41:11,300 --> 02:41:11,780
14.

3701
02:41:11,820 --> 02:41:12,080
14.

3702
02:41:24,540 --> 02:41:25,460
Why

3703
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:35,180
did you do that?

3704
02:41:35,860 --> 02:41:36,120
I don't know.

3705
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:37,740
I mean, I...

3706
02:41:37,740 --> 02:41:39,320
It's not...

3707
02:41:39,320 --> 02:41:40,860
I was going to say a kiss.

3708
02:41:40,860 --> 02:41:41,800
It's not dead.

3709
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:42,200
It's still alive.

3710
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:42,660
Why did you do that?

3711
02:41:46,780 --> 02:41:48,620
I don't know.

3712
02:41:48,760 --> 02:41:49,440
I can't...

3713
02:41:49,440 --> 02:41:50,660
I can't...

3714
02:41:50,660 --> 02:41:51,240
I don't know.

3715
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:51,860
Oh, it's 100.

3716
02:41:51,860 --> 02:41:52,840
Why did you do that?

3717
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:53,560
It's...

3718
02:41:53,560 --> 02:41:54,880
It's not dead.

3719
02:41:55,780 --> 02:41:56,140
Oh my god!

3720
02:41:56,140 --> 02:41:57,260
It's so insane!

3721
02:42:00,580 --> 02:42:03,400
You have... you're a 13 million dollar penny.

3722
02:42:05,400 --> 02:42:06,380
No deal.

3723
02:42:08,500 --> 02:42:11,060
This is the highest deal I think I'll ever see ever.

3724
02:42:13,640 --> 02:42:14,860
This is insane!

3725
02:42:15,400 --> 02:42:16,980
This is... what is happening?

3726
02:42:18,500 --> 02:42:19,560
Oh my god!

3727
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:20,220
Oh my god!

3728
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:20,580
Open the case.

3729
02:42:25,020 --> 02:42:25,640
Busting.

3730
02:42:30,600 --> 02:42:31,740
Here we go with 23.

3731
02:42:37,300 --> 02:42:37,890
Open the case.

3732
02:42:46,470 --> 02:42:48,270
We lost the penny.

3733
02:42:54,770 --> 02:42:56,170
Play a mini game.

3734
02:42:58,160 --> 02:42:58,470
Okay.

3735
02:43:00,250 --> 02:43:00,870
Okay.

3736
02:43:01,430 --> 02:43:02,550
What is this?

3737
02:43:08,230 --> 02:43:08,710
What?

3738
02:43:09,930 --> 02:43:11,090
This is awkward.

3739
02:43:13,630 --> 02:43:16,410
You only needed to cheat to barely win.

3740
02:43:16,990 --> 02:43:19,610
Each round, choose one of your remaining cases to be removed.

3741
02:43:19,730 --> 02:43:22,190
If you choose a money case, you'll continue playing.

3742
02:43:22,350 --> 02:43:24,350
If you choose an empty case, your game is over.

3743
02:43:24,590 --> 02:43:27,650
Each round you avoid the empty, you will earn even more money.

3744
02:43:28,690 --> 02:43:31,570
You may quit at any time in between rounds to keep your winnings.

3745
02:43:32,190 --> 02:43:32,670
Okay.

3746
02:43:32,950 --> 02:43:33,430
Ready?

3747
02:43:33,430 --> 02:43:33,630
Ready.

3748
02:43:33,630 --> 02:43:34,210
Push.

3749
02:43:34,890 --> 02:43:35,450
Your.

3750
02:43:36,190 --> 02:43:37,310
Luck.

3751
02:43:37,550 --> 02:43:38,010
Oh.

3752
02:43:38,170 --> 02:43:39,210
Me?

3753
02:43:39,430 --> 02:43:40,270
Five.

3754
02:43:40,810 --> 02:43:41,930
Ready.

3755
02:43:42,130 --> 02:43:42,630
Push.

3756
02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:43,970
Your.

3757
02:43:45,270 --> 02:43:45,830
Luck.

3758
02:43:49,530 --> 02:43:50,650
Ready.

3759
02:43:50,750 --> 02:43:51,550
Push.

3760
02:43:52,290 --> 02:43:52,910
Your.

3761
02:43:53,590 --> 02:43:54,710
Luck.

3762
02:43:57,200 --> 02:43:57,760
Ready.

3763
02:43:58,020 --> 02:43:58,540
Push.

3764
02:43:59,280 --> 02:43:59,860
Your.

3765
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:01,680
Luck.

3766
02:44:01,960 --> 02:44:02,820
Four.

3767
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:03,900
Ready.

3768
02:44:04,040 --> 02:44:04,920
Push.

3769
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:05,620
Your.

3770
02:44:07,280 --> 02:44:07,680
Luck.

3771
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:09,980
Oh, guys, it's 50-50.

3772
02:44:10,120 --> 02:44:10,620
What should I pick?

3773
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:11,100
What should I pick?

3774
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:11,640
What should I pick?

3775
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:14,500
What should I pick?

3776
02:44:16,020 --> 02:44:16,620
Pick six?

3777
02:44:19,100 --> 02:44:19,500
Lady,

3778
02:44:36,880 --> 02:44:37,620
luck be kind.

3779
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:39,900
Win one million or more in a single game.

3780
02:44:40,540 --> 02:44:41,040
Let's go.

3781
02:44:41,080 --> 02:44:41,660
Or more?

3782
02:44:44,620 --> 02:44:45,980
A little bird told me.

3783
02:44:46,140 --> 02:44:47,060
Unlock criteria.

3784
02:44:47,380 --> 02:44:51,160
Oh, pick a case that contains at least one million as the first case of any game in any mode.

3785
02:44:52,540 --> 02:44:55,440
Achieve a bank total of $250,000 or more.

3786
02:44:57,900 --> 02:45:00,160
Achieve a bank total of $500,000 or more.

3787
02:45:00,540 --> 02:45:02,220
One million dollars or more.

3788
02:45:05,420 --> 02:45:05,980
Let's go.

3789
02:45:06,140 --> 02:45:16,920
Wait, what's our... What's our... I want to see what our awards are.

3790
02:45:18,740 --> 02:45:19,800
How many are we missing?

3791
02:45:21,320 --> 02:45:22,940
Oh, wow, there's a lot of them.

3792
02:45:23,700 --> 02:45:24,600
There's so many.

3793
02:45:26,960 --> 02:45:27,440
Wow.

3794
02:45:31,180 --> 02:45:31,960
Blackjack time?

3795
02:45:32,200 --> 02:45:33,180
Yeah, let's do blackjack.

3796
02:45:33,220 --> 02:45:36,360
I cannot believe it actually came down to one million.

3797
02:45:36,560 --> 02:45:37,780
I mean, it was like three one millions.

3798
02:45:37,820 --> 02:45:39,780
But it was one million versus one penny.

3799
02:45:41,100 --> 02:45:42,560
I can't believe that happened.

3800
02:45:43,880 --> 02:45:45,740
I can't believe that happened.

3801
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:49,520
Ready, push, your luck.

3802
02:45:49,640 --> 02:45:49,780
One million.

3803
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:52,160
Blackjack!

3804
02:45:52,160 --> 02:45:52,340
Blackjack!

3805
02:45:54,520 --> 02:45:55,640
Versus the computer.

3806
02:45:59,910 --> 02:46:02,070
Oh, that's the most mint thing ever.

3807
02:46:02,550 --> 02:46:04,810
Hello and welcome to Blackjack.

3808
02:46:09,350 --> 02:46:10,670
What just happened?

3809
02:46:10,930 --> 02:46:11,550
Wait, what?

3810
02:46:13,850 --> 02:46:16,370
Oh, we're playing in the thousands.

3811
02:46:17,250 --> 02:46:17,890
Um...

3812
02:46:17,890 --> 02:46:18,690
Hit?

3813
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:27,260
Oh, hit me!

3814
02:46:28,380 --> 02:46:28,900
Hit!

3815
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:30,440
I

3816
02:46:34,010 --> 02:46:34,890
would have lost otherwise!

3817
02:46:35,190 --> 02:46:36,530
Wait, where's the double down?

3818
02:46:37,250 --> 02:46:37,770
Hit!

3819
02:46:38,570 --> 02:46:39,710
Ooh, hit.

3820
02:46:42,210 --> 02:46:44,330
Guys, have I won any money or...

3821
02:46:44,830 --> 02:46:45,090
Hit!

3822
02:46:46,470 --> 02:46:46,990
Hit!

3823
02:47:24,930 --> 02:47:26,450
I think I'm done.

3824
02:47:27,310 --> 02:47:29,050
I think I'm done playing.

3825
02:47:29,850 --> 02:47:32,070
I think I'm done playing D.R.

3826
02:47:32,070 --> 02:47:32,270
No.

3827
02:47:32,370 --> 02:47:32,910
D.R.

3828
02:47:35,090 --> 02:47:35,490
Oh!

3829
02:47:38,490 --> 02:47:40,730
What is wrong with you?

3830
02:47:43,730 --> 02:47:44,290
Thank

3831
02:47:48,450 --> 02:47:48,590
you!

3832
02:47:56,110 --> 02:47:58,270
I think I'm just gonna go.

3833
02:47:58,590 --> 02:48:00,390
I think I'm just gonna go.

3834
02:48:01,490 --> 02:48:03,870
It's okay, Zero, because you're priceless.

3835
02:48:05,090 --> 02:48:06,310
You're too kind.

3836
02:48:18,180 --> 02:48:19,540
This was a lot of fun.

3837
02:48:19,540 --> 02:48:22,920
This was such a rollercoaster of emotions, wasn't it?

3838
02:48:24,540 --> 02:48:26,500
We had some real highs.

3839
02:48:26,940 --> 02:48:28,600
We had some real lows.

3840
02:48:29,900 --> 02:48:31,540
But in the end...

3841
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:36,280
I had to cheat to win.

3842
02:48:37,900 --> 02:48:40,800
And even then, it was barely.

3843
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:44,180
You have terrible luck.

3844
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:45,600
You can't count cards.

3845
02:48:45,820 --> 02:48:47,220
You're addicted to gambling.

3846
02:48:47,220 --> 02:48:49,280
You pick cases poorly.

3847
02:48:49,940 --> 02:48:51,280
What do you mean?

3848
02:48:54,340 --> 02:48:56,260
It's just picking cases.

3849
02:48:56,760 --> 02:48:58,840
What else am I supposed to do?

3850
02:49:01,300 --> 02:49:03,200
How am I supposed to win?

3851
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:09,760
When it comes to being lucky, she's cursed.

3852
02:49:10,080 --> 02:49:12,360
When it comes to being loved, she's cursed.

3853
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:14,840
Okay, hold on.

3854
02:49:14,940 --> 02:49:15,340
Let me...

3855
02:49:15,340 --> 02:49:16,700
I'm gonna quit.

3856
02:49:21,010 --> 02:49:21,810
Oh gosh.

3857
02:49:22,090 --> 02:49:23,890
I wonder what the leaderboard looks like.

3858
02:49:25,410 --> 02:49:27,170
I need some more water.

3859
02:49:27,630 --> 02:49:28,950
Give me one second.

3860
02:49:29,070 --> 02:49:30,310
I'm gonna actually switch this over.

3861
02:49:37,560 --> 02:49:39,680
I need a break after that.

3862
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:43,900
Today, I was so... It was funny because I was like...

3863
02:49:53,210 --> 02:49:54,870
I was like...

3864
02:49:57,470 --> 02:50:01,830
I was like... Since I did Outer Wilds yesterday, I'm doing...

3865
02:50:03,050 --> 02:50:06,370
I'm doing like a no-brain game today, so...

3866
02:50:08,070 --> 02:50:10,590
It's a good thing you're cute, Mint, because you're luck.

3867
02:50:13,490 --> 02:50:16,010
I was like, I'm doing a no-brain game today.

3868
02:50:16,110 --> 02:50:17,150
It'll be so easy.

3869
02:50:20,130 --> 02:50:21,530
I'm just so sad.

3870
02:50:22,850 --> 02:50:26,290
I'm just so... I'm just so sad.

3871
02:50:30,240 --> 02:50:31,380
Oh, God.

3872
02:50:39,430 --> 02:50:40,590
Oh, man.

3873
02:50:40,990 --> 02:50:42,090
Actually, yeah.

3874
02:50:44,670 --> 02:50:46,090
That was fun, guys.

3875
02:50:46,350 --> 02:50:46,990
Thank you.

3876
02:50:51,410 --> 02:50:54,590
My luck is either 100 or negative.

3877
02:50:54,590 --> 02:50:56,630
This was a lot of fun.

3878
02:50:58,930 --> 02:51:04,210
I might be showing my age, but I will always remember Howie Mandel is the voice of Bobby from Bobby's World.

3879
02:51:05,170 --> 02:51:06,270
What's Bobby's World?

3880
02:51:06,730 --> 02:51:07,210
Uh-oh.

3881
02:51:07,230 --> 02:51:08,470
You're showing your age, Viralyn.

3882
02:51:09,430 --> 02:51:10,090
Uh-oh.

3883
02:51:10,190 --> 02:51:11,510
I don't know what you're talking about.

3884
02:51:13,170 --> 02:51:14,270
I have no idea.

3885
02:51:17,210 --> 02:51:18,970
Apache Slot stream flashbacks.

3886
02:51:20,430 --> 02:51:21,490
Gambling is so fun.

3887
02:51:21,710 --> 02:51:23,230
As long as it's fake money.

3888
02:51:23,430 --> 02:51:24,570
For me, at least.

3889
02:51:24,590 --> 02:51:25,150
Right?

3890
02:51:27,990 --> 02:51:29,710
I'm actually going to raid somebody today.

3891
02:51:31,250 --> 02:51:32,750
I'm going to raid somebody today.

3892
02:51:32,910 --> 02:51:33,190
I think...

3893
02:51:33,190 --> 02:51:34,650
Hopefully, I can raid her.

3894
02:51:34,970 --> 02:51:35,510
We'll see.

3895
02:51:36,910 --> 02:51:38,290
Either 100 or negative.

3896
02:51:38,490 --> 02:51:39,710
It's more like 100 negative.

3897
02:51:44,530 --> 02:51:47,190
But Miori... Miori Celesto is playing...

3898
02:51:48,830 --> 02:51:50,730
She's playing Red Dead Redemption.

3899
02:51:51,030 --> 02:51:52,350
So let me see if I can raid her.

3900
02:51:53,410 --> 02:51:54,190
No, sorry.

3901
02:51:54,190 --> 02:51:54,990
She's not playing...

3902
02:51:54,990 --> 02:51:55,770
That's Calliope.

3903
02:51:56,830 --> 02:51:58,650
Sorry, it showed up on my like...

3904
02:51:59,190 --> 02:52:00,330
It showed up on my thing.

3905
02:52:00,410 --> 02:52:02,070
She's playing Metal Gear Solid.

3906
02:52:07,970 --> 02:52:09,290
Okay, I need to go sleep.

3907
02:52:09,530 --> 02:52:11,030
I need to go rest, I think.

3908
02:52:13,730 --> 02:52:15,230
Oh no, it's not showing up.

3909
02:52:15,330 --> 02:52:16,410
I don't know if I can raid her.

3910
02:52:19,210 --> 02:52:21,590
I don't think it will let me raid Calliope.

3911
02:52:21,810 --> 02:52:23,830
I don't imagine they have that turned on.

3912
02:52:26,190 --> 02:52:28,230
Shoot, I wonder if I can...

3913
02:52:28,230 --> 02:52:29,630
Maybe if I put in her URL.

3914
02:52:29,870 --> 02:52:33,490
Thanks for the stream and keep on gambling as long as it's fake.

3915
02:52:33,710 --> 02:52:34,310
Thank you.

3916
02:52:35,470 --> 02:52:37,530
Wait, did she finish or did she just start?

3917
02:52:37,650 --> 02:52:38,150
I can't tell.

3918
02:52:40,110 --> 02:52:40,930
Oh, it says loading.

3919
02:52:41,050 --> 02:52:41,850
I think she just started.

3920
02:52:41,970 --> 02:52:42,390
Hold on.

3921
02:52:43,970 --> 02:52:46,450
Let me see if I put in her URL.

3922
02:52:46,570 --> 02:52:47,070
If it will work.

3923
02:52:47,070 --> 02:52:47,290
It will work.

3924
02:52:52,290 --> 02:52:57,830
I'm always nervous about raiding people because I don't want them to be uncomfortable.

3925
02:52:58,810 --> 02:53:01,010
This is the most hype and pain in a few hours.

3926
02:53:01,930 --> 02:53:03,370
Thanks for the stream.

3927
02:53:03,430 --> 02:53:03,970
Thank you.

3928
02:53:05,350 --> 02:53:07,190
Thank you guys for joining me.

3929
02:53:07,250 --> 02:53:09,230
This was a grand old time.

3930
02:53:09,570 --> 02:53:10,690
It was so much fun.

3931
02:53:14,430 --> 02:53:14,950
Paste.

3932
02:53:17,270 --> 02:53:18,890
Yeah, it says I can't.

3933
02:53:18,890 --> 02:53:22,590
Okay, I'm just going to post the link to her stream then if you want to watch Meori play.

3934
02:53:22,670 --> 02:53:24,330
She just started it seems like.

3935
02:53:24,990 --> 02:53:25,470
So...

3936
02:53:28,050 --> 02:53:30,230
Meori playing MGS2.

3937
02:53:31,650 --> 02:53:32,710
You can go...

3938
02:53:32,710 --> 02:53:34,270
We'll just manual raid.

3939
02:53:36,910 --> 02:53:37,850
It's the sand.

3940
02:53:38,090 --> 02:53:39,890
It absolutely is the sand.

3941
02:53:40,170 --> 02:53:41,210
We'll just say that.

3942
02:53:43,530 --> 02:53:44,370
Okay, guys.

3943
02:53:44,430 --> 02:53:45,410
Thank you so much.

3944
02:53:48,450 --> 02:53:51,370
Thank you guys and have a good night.

3945
02:53:52,970 --> 02:53:55,510
Tomorrow is Tokyo Jungle.

3946
02:53:55,990 --> 02:53:56,810
Tokyo Jungle.

3947
02:53:57,010 --> 02:53:58,410
So I'm excited about that.

3948
02:53:58,490 --> 02:54:00,470
We'll see how our luck fares there instead.

3949
02:54:02,470 --> 02:54:03,790
What a blast this was.

3950
02:54:03,850 --> 02:54:09,470
Hopefully next time I do a game show stream like this.

3951
02:54:09,530 --> 02:54:13,030
Maybe we can make it a collab with like some other VTubers.

3952
02:54:14,210 --> 02:54:15,370
We'll see who's available.

3953
02:54:15,890 --> 02:54:16,390
Look!

3954
02:54:16,670 --> 02:54:17,550
Thanks for two months.

3955
02:54:17,710 --> 02:54:18,290
Thank you.

3956
02:54:22,410 --> 02:54:23,410
Oh, gosh.

3957
02:54:23,590 --> 02:54:27,370
I think I'm going to go bed rot now because I'm just so sad.

3958
02:54:28,030 --> 02:54:30,310
You guys enjoy the rest of your evening.

3959
02:54:30,530 --> 02:54:32,830
Have a good night or day or whatever.

3960
02:54:34,490 --> 02:54:36,410
This is what I always say.

3961
02:54:37,050 --> 02:54:40,330
I'm unlucky so that you guys can be lucky, right?

3962
02:54:41,250 --> 02:54:47,270
I will absorb all your bad luck so that you guys can have all the luck in the world.

3963
02:54:47,330 --> 02:54:50,210
So that all the good things can happen to you guys.

3964
02:54:51,670 --> 02:54:53,470
I take the fall.

3965
02:54:55,210 --> 02:54:56,750
I take the fall for it.

3966
02:54:57,110 --> 02:54:59,670
I'm blessing your gacha pulls right now.

3967
02:55:00,930 --> 02:55:04,470
Which reminds me, I need to go try in Blue Archive because...

3968
02:55:05,510 --> 02:55:10,470
I got Bunny Ashina, but I want to get Bunny Karin and...

3969
02:55:10,470 --> 02:55:11,850
Who was the other one?

3970
02:55:11,990 --> 02:55:12,850
They were both uniques.

3971
02:55:16,950 --> 02:55:17,490
Neru!

3972
02:55:17,510 --> 02:55:18,490
Yeah, Bunny Neru.

3973
02:55:19,970 --> 02:55:20,510
Okay!

3974
02:55:21,610 --> 02:55:22,150
Atsuminto!

3975
02:55:22,590 --> 02:55:23,330
Bye guys!

3976
02:55:23,610 --> 02:55:24,150
Bye bye!

3977
02:55:24,770 --> 02:55:27,150
Bye bye!

3978
02:55:35,990 --> 02:55:38,910
Oh, and don't forget if you want to go manually raid...

3979
02:55:39,690 --> 02:55:41,330
Also, who said...

3980
02:55:41,530 --> 02:55:45,890
Who said Blue Archive gacha pulling stream 1?

3981
02:55:46,090 --> 02:55:47,790
Wheel of Fortune or Friends would go hard.

3982
02:55:47,950 --> 02:55:48,770
I would love to do that.

3983
02:55:48,970 --> 02:55:50,850
Who said Wheel of Fortune...

3984
02:55:50,850 --> 02:55:51,650
I mean, not Wheel of Fortune.

3985
02:55:51,710 --> 02:55:52,730
Who said Blue Archive?

3986
02:55:54,170 --> 02:55:56,170
I'm just going to go to bed.

3987
02:55:56,250 --> 02:55:56,670
Good night!

3988
02:55:57,430 --> 02:55:57,830
Atsuminto!

3989
02:55:58,250 --> 02:55:58,650
Itterashai!

3990
02:55:58,910 --> 02:55:59,330
Bye bye!
