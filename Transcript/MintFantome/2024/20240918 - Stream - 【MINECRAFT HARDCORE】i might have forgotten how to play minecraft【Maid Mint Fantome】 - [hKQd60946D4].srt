1
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,110
Oh!

2
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,130
Welcome back!

3
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,770
My master!

4
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:13,990
My lady!

5
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,310
Aww!

6
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,480
She's laughing at her pain.

7
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,280
I thought I had a different setting on.

8
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,280
So I didn't realize that I was...

9
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,400
So...

10
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,420
Here!

11
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm back!

12
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,540
Welcome back!

13
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,540
Hello!

14
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,500
Hello hello hello hello.

15
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,640
Welcome back.

16
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,960
Welcome back Minecraft.

17
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,180
Yeah!

18
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,040
Minecraft time!

19
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,180
Yippee!

20
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,480
Oh my gosh.

21
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,400
It's been so long since... actually, I've never seen this screen before.

22
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,880
When did Minecraft update?

23
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,060
Wait a second.

24
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,200
What is this?

25
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,200
These are the new lights.

26
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,840
I remember... wait, did they already show all of this?

27
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,100
It's new!

28
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,100
Oh my gosh, a while back.

29
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,020
1.2... 1.2... 1.1.

30
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,180
It's the new structures.

31
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,880
Wait, can we find this then?

32
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,400
How do we find it?

33
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:29,960
How do we find it?

34
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,480
How do we find it?

35
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,000
How do we find it?

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,560
How do we find it?

37
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,460
How do we find this?

38
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,040
How do we find this?

39
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,960
Where do we go?

40
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,380
Where do we go?

41
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,760
Where do we go?

42
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,560
What do we do?

43
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,120
What do we do?

44
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,880
I thought this was only gonna be for the bedrock for some reason.

45
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,440
I thought...

46
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,040
Hello Minto.

47
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,540
Minecraft?

48
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,680
Yes, Minecraft.

49
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,080
Have to head out in 30 minutes.

50
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,520
Oh no!

51
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,800
I need more context.

52
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,420
Probably by mining.

53
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,060
Okay.

54
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,200
Cartographers have maps probably.

55
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,120
Deep in caves!

56
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,980
That's gonna be our goal!

57
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,640
This will be our goal for today.

58
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,300
Is to find this and also I'm in hardcore mode so I can't die!

59
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,340
Thank you!

60
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,840
Thank you!

61
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,500
You're laughing?

62
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,400
We're crying because you hate us and you're laughing?

63
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,280
I work for another 3 hours plus hour drive home.

64
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
No, James!

65
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,500
Good luck with work.

66
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,900
I cannot mine of the craft today.

67
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,600
That's okay.

68
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,320
That's okay.

69
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,240
She's gonna die a lot.

70
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,460
I can't die a lot!

71
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,660
It's literally hardcore!

72
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,520
It's one and done, baby!

73
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,280
It's one and done.

74
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,520
But...

75
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,920
But...

76
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,040
I will have some help.

77
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,420
I have created Minto server!

78
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,160
I will allow access...

79
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,760
To... Okay, I have some rules.

80
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,540
Okay?

81
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,380
I have some rules for those...

82
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,140
Wanting to join.

83
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,660
Any memboos in chat...

84
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,480
I will give you...

85
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,580
The...

86
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,880
The access.

87
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
But...

88
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,440
How long until you regret it?

89
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,560
Maybe immediately.

90
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,400
Who knows?

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,840
Um...

92
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,100
So...

93
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,980
So...

94
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,180
Uh...

95
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,980
No killing Minto...

96
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,140
On purpose.

97
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,800
Andrey goes next to the 20!

98
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,860
Um... I... Oh, wait.

99
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,380
Hold on.

100
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,440
I have to give myself admin powers to be able to ban people.

101
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,320
Wait.

102
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,360
What's my... Hold on.

103
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,340
Hold on.

104
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,560
Manage server.

105
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,560
Become admin.

106
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,200
I think that's my name.

107
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,680
Hmm...

108
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,300
So...

109
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,200
You know...

110
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,940
It's hardcore.

111
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,300
Normally, if it wasn't hardcore, I'd be like, whatever.

112
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,860
But because it's hardcore...

113
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,240
Don't.

114
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,640
Okay?

115
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,880
Let's have... Let's be nice.

116
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,360
Okay?

117
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,060
Let's have fun.

118
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,960
Let's have a good stream.

119
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,380
Okay?

120
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:22,780
Thank you.

121
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,400
Thank you.

122
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,100
And also...

123
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,580
Also...

124
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,160
If you die...

125
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,640
Leave...

126
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,740
The server.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,660
So that more people can join.

128
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,800
And take your spot.

129
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,880
There's only 100 slots.

130
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,140
You want as many people to be able to come in as they can.

131
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:42,840
So...

132
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,060
Yes, yes, yes.

133
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,100
Andrey goes, thank you for the 20 gift.

134
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,580
Thank you!

135
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,740
Thank you so much!

136
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,860
Babycore, thanks for the gift.

137
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,920
Oh my gosh.

138
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,000
Wake up, Black.

139
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,720
Thank you for the 20 gift.

140
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,280
Thank you!

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,460
Work time for the Ashes.

142
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,300
And by that, I mean watching Mint's stream.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,980
But yeah...

144
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,880
So...

145
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,260
If you die, you are dead.

146
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,740
Exactly!

147
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,800
If you die...

148
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,640
That's it, buddy.

149
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,580
You're kicked out.

150
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,520
You're gone.

151
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,820
You're donezo.

152
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,180
Okay?

153
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,900
So...

154
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,160
Hopefully, it allows...

155
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,980
People to be able to come in.

156
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,480
There is PvP on.

157
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,260
Don't be a jerk.

158
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:31,760
You know?

159
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,300
Don't go on like a whole ass killing spree.

160
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,540
But...

161
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,160
You know...

162
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,400
You know...

163
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,020
Let's work together to try and find...

164
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,160
This place.

165
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,260
Right?

166
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,340
Let's try and find...

167
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,100
This place.

168
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,020
Because I really actually want to see it.

169
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,560
I don't know what's in there.

170
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,080
But I want to see it.

171
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,760
I want to go to there.

172
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,020
If you die in Minecraft, you die in IRL.

173
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:03,900
Yes.

174
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:04,940
Pretty much.

175
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,260
Whoever runs the cemetery is going to be...

176
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,880
No!

177
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,340
Be slightly more normal than Mint.

178
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:10,780
Yeah!

179
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,200
Wait.

180
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:11,820
What does that mean?

181
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:12,920
Wait.

182
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,580
What do you mean by that?

183
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:18,940
Okay.

184
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,520
But I'm going to join first.

185
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,720
I'm going to join first and we're going to see.

186
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,460
Actually, I had to join because I had to do some stuff.

187
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,320
I had to check some stuff.

188
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,800
So I actually know where we are.

189
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,580
And boy, golly, our location is kind of...

190
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,360
You guys ready to see the spawn?

191
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,580
Here we go.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,160
Good luck, everybody.

193
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,660
Getting out of the tree.

194
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,440
What is this?

195
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,780
This is the worst.

196
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,180
But we have so much bamboo.

197
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,880
So we'll get so much wood and everything.

198
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,720
Welcome to the jungle.

199
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,580
Okay.

200
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,300
Another thing.

201
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,720
It shows the hearts as not hardcore.

202
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,780
But I tested it on another server.

203
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,800
I'm not sure why it's not showing up.

204
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,180
But I tested it on a different server.

205
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,400
Like I tried it out multiple times last night.

206
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,660
And it definitely was hardcore.

207
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,380
When I died, I was not able to come back.

208
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,840
What the...

209
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,000
Wait.

210
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,500
What's going on?

211
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,140
Also, why is there no sound?

212
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,740
But also, what's going on?

213
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,980
Oh, my volume is off.

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,240
That's why.

215
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,160
Okay.

216
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,160
I'll try.

217
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:56,920
Oh!

218
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,280
Spawn...

219
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,480
Oh, spawn protection!

220
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,640
Oh!

221
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,220
Okay.

222
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,480
Okay.

223
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,260
Wait.

224
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,260
How am I supposed to get out of the tree then?

225
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,820
This is messed up!

226
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,240
Did it make a boot?

227
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,020
Did it make...

228
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,360
Oh, wait.

229
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:11,520
No.

230
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,100
I used my hand.

231
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,460
That's why.

232
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,380
How am I supposed to get out of the tree?

233
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,220
Okay.

234
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,500
Okay.

235
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,320
Okay!

236
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,180
Okay.

237
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,500
We are good!

238
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,500
We are good.

239
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:27,620
We are good.

240
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:27,840
We're good.

241
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,980
I'm going to get down the tree first and then I will allow access.

242
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:36,930
Okay.

243
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,150
I'm gonna get down first.

244
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,330
Gonna change spawn?

245
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,050
No.

246
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,710
Why would I do that?

247
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,090
NVIDIA STOCKS!

248
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,690
STOCKS!

249
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,190
Sinbad, thank you so much for the Aqua Supa.

250
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,630
Thank you!

251
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,250
Okay, guys.

252
00:11:59,510 --> 00:11:59,810
Okay.

253
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:07,650
I'm gonna lock myself up first because I'm scared of it turning nighttime while I do this because I'm a little slow.

254
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,430
Hold on.

255
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:08,770
Let's...

256
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,530
Let's get some bamboo.

257
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,390
Oh my gosh.

258
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,210
This is so scary.

259
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,090
Wait.

260
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,090
Why is this also...

261
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,750
Is this also part of the spawn?

262
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,330
Oh.

263
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:18,810
Interesting.

264
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,130
Maybe...

265
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,670
I don't think I should turn that off but...

266
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,430
Interesting.

267
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,390
Interesting.

268
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:26,710
Interesting.

269
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,390
I'm under the tree.

270
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:29,970
Oh my gosh.

271
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,490
It even extends all the way to here.

272
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,250
Okay.

273
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,210
Okay.

274
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,590
We're fine.

275
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:35,950
We're fine.

276
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,510
Everything's good.

277
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,830
I'm gonna make myself a little house.

278
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,870
A little hut, you know?

279
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:48,650
Panda.

280
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,070
Is there a panda?

281
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:52,850
Panda!

282
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:54,870
Okay.

283
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,030
Alright.

284
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,010
This should be good, right?

285
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,910
Wait.

286
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,470
How do I...

287
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,510
Oh gosh.

288
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,050
It's...

289
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,550
Guys, I think I forgot how to play Minecraft for real.

290
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:09,390
I literally have not touched Minecraft since like the last time I played, I think.

291
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:09,910
So...

292
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,310
Bamboo.

293
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,530
Wait.

294
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,270
Bamboo.

295
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,330
I don't have that much.

296
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,970
Wait.

297
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,890
I thought there was gonna be more.

298
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,670
Uh-oh.

299
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,650
Oh no.

300
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:20,670
Okay.

301
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,750
I'm making my house.

302
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,250
Wait.

303
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,370
You guys are also gonna spawn in at night then.

304
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,970
Wait.

305
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,030
Maybe we should...

306
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,550
Maybe we should wait for it to come back to daytime.

307
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,170
Late time, maybe.

308
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:31,870
Right?

309
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,610
Maybe we should wait?

310
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,380
We'll be fine?

311
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,920
You'll be fine?

312
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
It's really dark in here.

313
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,100
I can't even see what's up.

314
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:48,640
Okay.

315
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,080
Okay.

316
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,440
There.

317
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,980
I have a little window.

318
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,080
Okay.

319
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,080
Okay.

320
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,280
I'm scared.

321
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,180
I don't actually know if the admin thing works.

322
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,560
Let's see.

323
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,280
Time.

324
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,660
Wait.

325
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,540
Set.

326
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,360
Wait.

327
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,380
Does it work?

328
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,540
Um.

329
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,500
Actually, I don't know.

330
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,720
Time set.

331
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,700
Set.

332
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:28,660
Time.

333
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,740
I don't think I have perms.

334
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,700
It didn't work!

335
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,280
Oh, I think I needed to reset the server.

336
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,640
It's getting awfully dark out there.

337
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,100
It's getting awfully dark out there, you guys.

338
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,700
Slash time.

339
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,880
It doesn't work.

340
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,420
It doesn't work.

341
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,540
It doesn't work.

342
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:50,980
It doesn't work.

343
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,440
Hold on.

344
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,580
I'm gonna reset the server.

345
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,040
And also get the stuff.

346
00:14:59,300 --> 00:14:59,520
Okay.

347
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,280
It worked.

348
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
And then I reset.

349
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,980
And then I give you...

350
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,240
Oh, wait.

351
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,000
But I have to...

352
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,840
I have to go in first.

353
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,640
I have to go in first.

354
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,800
Okay.

355
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:06,900
Okay.

356
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:07,960
Reboot!

357
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,420
Reboot!

358
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:09,640
Okay.

359
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,720
And let me make the post.

360
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Let me do this.

361
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,580
I wouldn't have posted it sooner, but, you know, I gotta get in first, you guys.

362
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,740
Memboos only.

363
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,380
Okay.

364
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,660
Maybe it's done?

365
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,560
Oh.

366
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,680
Process has been done.

367
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,160
Okay.

368
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,140
Okay.

369
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,800
Okay.

370
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,560
Okay.

371
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,400
Okay.

372
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,800
Okay.

373
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,460
Okay.

374
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:43,620
Okay.

375
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,100
Okay.

376
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,300
Wait.

377
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,120
Why doesn't it work?

378
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,580
Why doesn't it work?

379
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,660
You know what?

380
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,560
I guess I'll have to be, um...

381
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,380
OP or something?

382
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:00,880
I don't now...

383
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,540
Oh, SlashOP?

384
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,300
What does that mean?

385
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,680
SlashOP Mint Phantom.

386
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,480
I don't...

387
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,880
In the server console...

388
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,200
Guys, I have not idea what I'm going.

389
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,120
To be honest...

390
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,420
How do I get to the server console?

391
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,850
Server console open.

392
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,690
Is that... hold on.

393
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,630
I thought just becoming a... I wonder if actually...

394
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,190
That's not my username.

395
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,170
I actually have no idea what my username is.

396
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:43,910
Maybe...

397
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,090
Because I had to change it.

398
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,270
Oh, there's the console.

399
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,750
Slash OP...

400
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,190
I wonder if that's me.

401
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,070
Hold on, am I Mint Phantom?

402
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,230
Footsteps!

403
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,010
Oh my gosh.

404
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,370
They're here, they're here, they're here, they're here, they're here.

405
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,410
You guys, they're here, they're here, they're here!

406
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,870
Press tab.

407
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,770
Made Mint Phantom!

408
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,050
Of course I was wrong!

409
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,630
Okay, hold on.

410
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:28,810
Made...

411
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,090
Execute.

412
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,630
I wonder if...

413
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,430
Made a server operator!

414
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,270
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it.

415
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,300
But, does that mean I can't die?

416
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,980
I want to be able to die too.

417
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,320
Time, set, day.

418
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,980
Yippee!

419
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,820
Okay.

420
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,400
Alright.

421
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,760
I'm going to be posting...

422
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,360
The, um, way to get into the server.

423
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,280
Oh, you can?

424
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:02,880
Yippee!

425
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay.

426
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,320
Happy birthday, Bebong!

427
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,040
Alright.

428
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,140
A three.

429
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Again, remember.

430
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,540
No killing Minto on purpose.

431
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,180
You know?

432
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,560
We're playing fair.

433
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,940
Having a good stream.

434
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,040
Um...

435
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:31,770
Uh...

436
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,070
Once you die, leave.

437
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,350
Okay?

438
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,150
Okay.

439
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,490
Okie dokie.

440
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,710
What version is this?

441
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,190
Uh...

442
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,690
1.2...

443
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,770
1.1.

444
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,060
Alright, and then of course we'll be in a membership post.

445
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,580
Because this is for Memboos to join.

446
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,620
Post!

447
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,840
2.

448
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,080
3.

449
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,120
9.

450
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,520
13.

451
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:15,640
24.

452
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,720
26.

453
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,080
27.

454
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,960
27.

455
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,560
33.

456
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,820
I think it's gonna lag.

457
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,800
There's a lag.

458
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,640
It won't.

459
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,200
Everybody's frozen in time.

460
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,840
Wait,

461
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,300
let me back in.

462
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,080
You guys have to let me in!

463
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,620
It's a Bicep!

464
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,740
No!

465
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,780
I knew this would happen.

466
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,980
It's still so funny to see.

467
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,820
No!

468
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,500
Let me in the Bicep!

469
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,720
Our server now.

470
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,760
No!

471
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,200
Don't take my wood!

472
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,090
I wonder when I can join again.

473
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,810
Is it dead dead?

474
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,850
No way!

475
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,800
Can't connect.

476
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,840
Did it die die?

477
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,040
Oh my gosh.

478
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,440
Money wasted.

479
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,540
I even paid for the good stuff.

480
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:05,060
I'm gonna be getting an email from the place that's hosting this being like, What did you do?

481
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,240
Let me try rebooting it.

482
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,760
They're gonna be like, They're gonna be like, You!

483
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,080
Go back.

484
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,120
No!

485
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,100
No!

486
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,780
No!

487
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,340
They're gonna be like, VTuber!

488
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,200
How dare you!

489
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:30,900
Crash!

490
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,500
Let's see.

491
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:41,980
Okay.

492
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,480
No!

493
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,640
Oh gosh, it's night time.

494
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,100
It's night time.

495
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,700
You guys, none of us have swords, none of us have anything.

496
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,100
What do we do?

497
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,200
Do you think it'll crash again?

498
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,920
I can't tell, I can't see anything.

499
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,180
Time.

500
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,440
Set.

501
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,080
Day.

502
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,040
It's so over, you guys.

503
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,660
It's so over.

504
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:44,860
How?

505
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,530
Slowroll people and how do I do that, though?

506
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,060
Everyone form a line.

507
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,120
Hold on.

508
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,360
Let me go back in the control panel.

509
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,260
How do I allow it to only just a certain number of people then?

510
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,760
Let's see...

511
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:33,780
Have

512
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,910
like a limit... the limit does not exist?

513
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,830
Oh

514
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,250
wait, here maybe?

515
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,270
I'm learning how to code in real time.

516
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,110
Oh, here we go.

517
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,710
Okay, I'm gonna start with the 25.

518
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,030
I'm gonna start with a 25.

519
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:39,470
And then I'll raise it slowly and slowly and slowly and slowly and slowly and slowly.

520
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,310
It's processing, it's processing, it's processing...

521
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,500
It's processing, it's... oh, okay.

522
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,090
One second again.

523
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,070
Okay, it's processing, it's processing, it's processing...

524
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,600
The server is not allowed to be full, you guys!

525
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,520
I have to go in first!

526
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,880
This is literally defeating the purpose!

527
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,180
Leave!

528
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:19,960
Leave!

529
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,780
Leave!

530
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,520
Leave!

531
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,780
It's processing, it's processing, it's processing, it's processing...

532
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,280
It's processing, it's processing, it's processing...

533
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,640
Oh, wait.

534
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,090
Me first?

535
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:37,430
Ah!

536
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,750
Oh my gosh.

537
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,990
It's night time?

538
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,800
Look at you guys just standing there menacingly!

539
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,660
Guys, did I make a mistake?

540
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,720
Guys?

541
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,620
Guys?

542
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,700
Did you reboot it?

543
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,520
Yeah, I did!

544
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,300
I did!

545
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,620
I rebooted!

546
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,280
I rebooted!

547
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,320
I rebooted!

548
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,320
I rebooted!

549
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,340
I rebooted!

550
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,280
My poor server!

551
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,210
You guys!

552
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,670
I paid money for this!

553
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,810
Please!

554
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,150
Oh my god.

555
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm going back in.

556
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,320
I'm connecting to the server.

557
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,280
I'm going in.

558
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,640
I'm going in.

559
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,820
Guys, I'm going in.

560
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,680
Not even with the 25 people!

561
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,820
It's the amount of people trying to connect.

562
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,380
I think so too, perhaps.

563
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,880
Including me.

564
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,040
No!

565
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,380
What do I do then?

566
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,240
Why didn't you use a queue system monitor?

567
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,580
Um, I don't know.

568
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,280
Why didn't you?

569
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,660
Why didn't you shut the heck up?

570
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,480
Why didn't you shut the heck up?

571
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:29,620
Why didn't you?

572
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,160
All I wanted to do was something fun.

573
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,360
Honestly, I had the idea like last night.

574
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,600
And I was just like, what if I do this?

575
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,300
And then I didn't think that would be a problem.

576
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:44,870
I'm stupid.

577
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,110
It's all me.

578
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,030
It's all me.

579
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,650
We need a bouncer.

580
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,550
Oh well.

581
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,690
Goodbye money.

582
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,890
Waste of my money.

583
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,470
Delete game server.

584
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,490
Bye everybody.

585
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,970
Well, I can still do Minecraft hardcore.

586
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,850
Just all by myself.

587
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,210
So sad and lonely.

588
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,970
Hardcore.

589
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,770
Sad, sad, lonely world.

590
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,510
No!

591
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,550
But we're still gonna try and find the...

592
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,170
This thing.

593
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:37,530
Whatever.

594
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,190
Whatever this is.

595
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:39,910
So...

596
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:40,110
Oh!

597
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,830
Oh, it's chilly.

598
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,550
Oh.

599
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:44,890
Okay.

600
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,470
Alright, we're playing the game now everybody.

601
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,370
And it's real hardcore.

602
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,110
Why don't I hear anything?

603
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:51,810
For real.

604
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,690
I think I turned everything off.

605
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,130
No?

606
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,190
Huh.

607
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,130
I can't even hear my own footsteps.

608
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,910
Weird.

609
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,730
Goodbye server.

610
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,410
Oh, I kind of hear it.

611
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,930
Is the music loud by the way?

612
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,430
Just let me know.

613
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,150
Let's get some wood.

614
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,290
Let's get some wood.

615
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:16,850
Sorry guys.

616
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,530
I tried.

617
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,230
I tried.

618
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,550
Maybe in the future, I can actually get someone that knows what they're doing.

619
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,750
And not just me being a silly goose the night before.

620
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:33,960
It's good?

621
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,440
Okay.

622
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,820
Yes.

623
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,280
Are Minecraft servers expensive?

624
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,320
No, not really.

625
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,820
Oh, we're like really...

626
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,040
I think this is the place.

627
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,700
I think this...

628
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,580
I think it's probably like right underneath us.

629
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,040
This place is so mysterious.

630
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,940
I think it's probably right beneath us.

631
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,080
But there's like no food here.

632
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,380
Okay.

633
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,400
We're gonna...

634
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,460
So how does one find...

635
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,120
This structure?

636
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,520
This new cave feature?

637
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,900
It's not like part of...

638
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
What's it called?

639
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,580
Is it...

640
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,060
The place that gets you to the end?

641
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,300
The trial chamber?

642
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,580
That sounds serious.

643
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,680
That sounds a little freaky when you say it like that.

644
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,800
When you call it a trial chamber.

645
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,600
But it's...

646
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,740
It's in the main world.

647
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,120
No, but I mean like it's not...

648
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,780
What I'm trying to say is it's not...

649
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,420
It's not...

650
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,540
I'm trying to see if there's like a ice village.

651
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,000
It's not connected to the...

652
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,300
To that place, is it?

653
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,460
It's planning on giving you a flower, Minecraft.

654
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,140
Thanks.

655
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,580
Here, I'll take this one.

656
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,540
There we go.

657
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:15,800
Whoa.

658
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,120
Village, village.

659
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,240
Is there a village around here?

660
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,540
We're gonna start getting hungry and then we're gonna start dying.

661
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,020
You guys, I'm not...

662
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,600
I can't die.

663
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,700
I'm gonna have to kill this bunny.

664
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,080
I'm gonna have to kill things to survive.

665
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,000
They're so small though.

666
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,480
They got like no meat on them.

667
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,740
Bunny, yes.

668
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,520
Bunny, yes.

669
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,020
It's...

670
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,300
Minto needs to eat.

671
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,580
Hmm.

672
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,280
Nothing inside.

673
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,140
Whoa.

674
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,160
Got some towering places.

675
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,760
Let's see.

676
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,620
Igloo to the right?

677
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,700
Igloo?

678
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:14,520
Oh!

679
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,360
I completely missed it.

680
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,240
Igloo!

681
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,080
Igloo inbound!

682
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,760
I was so focused on trying to find a village.

683
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,460
Oh!

684
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,320
Oh, well, that doesn't really matter, does it?

685
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,620
Oh, yes!

686
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,700
You think?

687
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,240
Aw.

688
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,440
Dang.

689
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,440
Okay.

690
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,460
But this is good.

691
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,540
I mean, a little bit.

692
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:44,960
Um...

693
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,860
Uh, we have a home.

694
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,380
We have a home.

695
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,960
A home base even.

696
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,940
I can make you good soup.

697
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,980
You're gonna make me turntable?

698
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,400
A turtle soup?

699
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,840
Are you gonna make...

700
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,300
Here, I make good soup.

701
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,560
Break the gray carpet.

702
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,360
Oh, this one?

703
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,600
Oh, I thought it was the one in the middle.

704
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,560
Nope.

705
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,800
Unlucky.

706
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,160
You guys are watching Minto's stream.

707
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,160
Did you expect anything else?

708
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,660
All right, so we got our little home.

709
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,700
I'm gonna put my bed here.

710
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:34,960
Um...

711
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,400
Put this back here.

712
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,600
Uh...

713
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,380
And let's go...

714
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,020
First, I'm gonna make a door.

715
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,660
First, jungle server.

716
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,460
Second, Alaska.

717
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:53,940
For the future server fundings, I could say I logged in for like 10 seconds, jumped three times, and server died.

718
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,040
Yeah!

719
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,640
Yippee!

720
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,680
Okay, we really need food now.

721
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,920
Oh, gosh.

722
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,920
I gotta...

723
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,620
Okay, let's go.

724
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:12,720
Sword.

725
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,920
Wait, how do I...

726
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,740
Oh, I need sticks.

727
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,480
Sword.

728
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,920
And we need...

729
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,500
Stuff to...

730
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,160
Um...

731
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,500
We can use, uh...

732
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,760
The...

733
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,940
What's it called, right?

734
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,160
The logs.

735
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,220
To burn.

736
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,160
Here, bunny, bunny, bunny, bunny!

737
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,200
Here, bunny, bunny, bunny!

738
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,640
Oh, yeah.

739
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,640
Don't look!

740
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,220
Don't look if you're afraid!

741
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,460
Wait, what the hell?

742
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,840
Oh my god.

743
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,180
Literally no meat.

744
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,340
Oh, bunny!

745
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,080
Yeah!

746
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,400
Okay.

747
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,160
It was a baby.

748
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,500
Um...

749
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,340
My...

750
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,360
I'm also a baby.

751
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,940
I need food to live.

752
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,540
I'm a baby!

753
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,220
I'm a baby!

754
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:05,920
I'm a baby!

755
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,060
I'm sorry!

756
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,900
Don't look at me, please!

757
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,040
Don't look at me as I kill you!

758
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,900
Please don't look...

759
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,840
Don't look at me as I kill you!

760
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,480
You guys, I have to eat!

761
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,120
I have to eat!

762
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,740
Okay, let's go cut down...

763
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:17,880
Oh!

764
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:18,840
Pumpkins!

765
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,860
Oh, I could have eaten these instead.

766
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,240
Um...

767
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
Don't worry about it.

768
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:29,900
Don't...

769
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,060
Don't worry about it.

770
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,760
It's not for no reason.

771
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,480
It's for survival!

772
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,860
I'm just like that bear, guys.

773
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,060
I...

774
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,480
I have to eat!

775
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,440
Someday you feed on a pumpkin.

776
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,260
Some days you have to kill a bunny.

777
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,360
You can't eat pumpkins.

778
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,020
Yes, you can.

779
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,100
You can make pumpkin pie.

780
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,900
I know how to play Minecraft.

781
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,580
Um...

782
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,640
Oh, that's right.

783
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,620
I'm gonna plant ye...

784
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,000
Oh, wait.

785
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,700
Just kidding.

786
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,060
I'm gonna beat this tree up.

787
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,060
The Minto server graveyard is going so swell.

788
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,080
What do you mean graveyard?

789
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,280
I deleted it.

790
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,360
What do you mean?

791
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,440
How are there people there?

792
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,000
Like so, right?

793
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,240
Yeah.

794
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,820
We're all playing on a Wisp server.

795
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,660
How do I join?

796
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,600
How do I join?

797
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:49,820
How do I join?

798
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,640
How do I join?

799
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,060
Does it fall through your tum tum?

800
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,760
No.

801
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,260
Okay.

802
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,740
Oh.

803
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,420
Delicious.

804
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,680
Okay.

805
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,200
We don't want those to burn up.

806
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,760
No girls allowed.

807
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,280
You're gonna say that to all the girl Wisps?

808
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,200
You're gonna say no girls allowed?

809
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,580
To all the girl Wisps that are wanting to join?

810
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,360
You guys, I'm so lonely.

811
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,440
I thought we'd be able to play.

812
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,000
That's honestly...

813
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,160
Oh.

814
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,380
Dinner!

815
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,760
Dinner!

816
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,360
Dinner!

817
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,320
Dinner!

818
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,400
Dinner!

819
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,120
Dinner!

820
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,520
Dinner!

821
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,320
I can't have the pumpkin pie yet.

822
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,280
I need sugar.

823
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,440
Which actually there should be some like down here, shouldn't there?

824
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:49,240
That's why I haven't played so much Minecraft because it's just not as fun without, you know, with without people.

825
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,840
Um.

826
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,000
Um.

827
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,340
Um.

828
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:51,740
Oh.

829
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,080
There's a portal thing.

830
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,160
I see sugar.

831
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,100
Sugar cane.

832
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,080
Sugar cane.

833
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,120
Oh!

834
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:03,900
Yippee!

835
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,800
Sugar sugar.

836
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,200
Sugar sugar sugar.

837
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,280
Yeah.

838
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,480
It's so much more fun with people.

839
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,540
So.

840
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,340
I just haven't played.

841
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,860
But that's okay.

842
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Maybe next time, um, I can get it working for reals.

843
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,200
For realsies.

844
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,180
For actual real.

845
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,240
Uh.

846
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,800
Uh.

847
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,000
Ooh!

848
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,260
Ooh!

849
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,020
These are kind of useless, but I'll take it.

850
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:39,920
Um.

851
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,260
Take this chill.

852
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,100
Yeah.

853
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,760
Okay, bye.

854
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,220
All right, let's go home.

855
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,820
That guy's not gonna attack me, right?

856
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,620
He doesn't have any children.

857
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,380
You are childless.

858
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,450
You are childless.

859
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,450
Okay.

860
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,690
I missed the jungle area though.

861
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,210
I missed the berry.

862
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,770
What do you want, berry?

863
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:17,210
Hold on.

864
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:17,970
I'll read it.

865
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,510
How does it taste?

866
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,630
Wait, wait.

867
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,090
What do I?

868
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,330
Why?

869
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:22,930
What are we saying?

870
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,330
Oh gosh.

871
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,050
It's getting dark.

872
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,170
Okay.

873
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,050
I have to live.

874
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:26,710
I have to live.

875
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,630
I have to live, you guys.

876
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,170
I have to live.

877
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,230
Nothing will spawn in my house, right?

878
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,430
I have a little tiny light.

879
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,110
I have a little night light.

880
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,290
Why aren't you in full diamond armor yet?

881
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,440
Haha.

882
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,100
OMG the Wisp server is so fun.

883
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,120
I just ate a fish.

884
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,820
Berry, you're so mean!

885
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,520
You're so mean to me!

886
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,080
Why would you do this?

887
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,860
Why would you do this?

888
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,160
I don't even make a sugar.

889
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,620
And a pumpkin pie.

890
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,180
What do I need?

891
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,680
I need chickens!

892
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,410
Why are you so mean?

893
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,480
I'll waste a log for this.

894
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,860
Okay, let's go find some chickens.

895
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,310
I didn't know pumpkin pie actually required eggs.

896
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:35,950
Is that normal?

897
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,650
I don't think that's very normal, is it?

898
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,410
Well, let's put this on just in case.

899
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:41,990
Wait.

900
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,270
Okay, projectile projection.

901
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:44,970
Okay.

902
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:45,850
I'll take it.

903
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,330
Cakes require eggs.

904
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,210
But it's not a cake.

905
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:52,790
It's a pie.

906
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,470
It's literally in the name.

907
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,610
It's called pumpkin pie.

908
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,150
Not pumpkin cake.

909
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,630
Oh no, it's a family.

910
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,250
Puts it away.

911
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,310
Sheep!

912
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,900
Oh, it's a family.

913
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,700
I'm at work right now, so I can't say to watch.

914
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,360
Thank you though for the server chat.

915
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:27,980
Good luck on the work!

916
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,500
The server is so fun.

917
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,080
I can't believe I already found diamond.

918
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,200
Why are you guys bullying me?

919
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,300
You guys are bullying me.

920
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,780
I want to play with people.

921
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:40,940
Wait.

922
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,900
What is this?

923
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,300
Oh, was it me?

924
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,280
I'll take it.

925
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:49,860
Leftovers.

926
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,040
A village!

927
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,460
Village hole!

928
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,520
Village, village, village.

929
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,960
Okay, we're going to take their stuff.

930
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,280
We're going to take their things.

931
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,940
I got to start digging.

932
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,580
I got to start getting some...

933
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,440
Oh, oh, oh.

934
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,040
I got to start getting...

935
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,260
What's the word?

936
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:24,710
Coal?

937
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,010
Supplies.

938
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:26,730
We need coal.

939
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:27,830
So we can make...

940
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,010
More...

941
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,130
We make torches?

942
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,290
I mean, this place has free torches right here.

943
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,530
And free armor!

944
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:39,670
Okay.

945
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,670
This village is a little rich.

946
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:43,910
What do you got?

947
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,510
Oh, well take it all.

948
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,530
Take it all!

949
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,090
Take it all!

950
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:47,630
Take it all!

951
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:49,550
Take it all!

952
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:49,990
Take it all!

953
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:50,390
Take it all!

954
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,370
Yeah, we gotta make iron.

955
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,330
We gotta do everything.

956
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,930
I wanna find... you know, maybe if trying to find this in Hardcore was a mistake.

957
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:09,550
This potentially dangerous area that everyone keeps saying, Minto, you won't find it.

958
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,690
You will die.

959
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,290
Oh, nice jackpot.

960
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:15,430
Potatoes.

961
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:16,370
Potatoes.

962
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:18,130
Pumpkin pie!

963
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,490
Take all the food you can.

964
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:23,970
Take all the food.

965
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,150
Rob them.

966
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,550
Rob them.

967
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:26,570
Leave them with nothing.

968
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,270
The wisps are so fun.

969
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,250
I just killed a man.

970
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:42,930
Excuse me.

971
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:44,910
Iron!

972
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:47,150
Alright.

973
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:47,590
Alright.

974
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:49,150
So far so good.

975
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:49,870
Ouch.

976
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,300
Are you sure you wouldn't just stalk people in the server?

977
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:58,720
What?

978
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:58,920
No!

979
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,680
You tried... What do you mean you tried shipping them?

980
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,120
Tried shipping who?

981
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,620
Are there any other houses?

982
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,220
Okay, here we go.

983
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,660
This is a really big village.

984
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,900
How is this tree...

985
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,320
How is this working?

986
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,440
How is this... Huh?

987
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,520
Hidden... secrets?

988
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,660
Potentially where the location we are trying to go to is at?

989
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,420
I don't think anybody can even enter this home.

990
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:37,660
Oh!

991
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,740
Oh, I just freed... I just freed the prisoner.

992
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,000
I think...

993
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,340
I think that guy was in there on purpose.

994
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,000
My bad.

995
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:49,960
Whoa!

996
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,080
This place is fancy!

997
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:52,280
Let's see.

998
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,700
Cooper, thanks for the $10 gift!

999
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,290
Okay.

1000
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:03,690
I got in.

1001
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,930
Thank you Minto for setting this up.

1002
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:06,790
Wait.

1003
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,750
How did you get in?

1004
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:08,970
What do you mean you got in?

1005
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:11,330
Are you here?

1006
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,550
Here O'Brien?

1007
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,330
Are you here O'Brien-ing my server right now?

1008
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,320
Free bun?

1009
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,020
I have a bun.

1010
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,660
Oh wait, I left it, didn't I?

1011
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,380
But also, once we go into the mines, there's no point in having a bed.

1012
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,240
There's no point.

1013
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,020
But I'll take it anyway.

1014
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,880
Yeah, my bed is in the igloo.

1015
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,780
I was just gonna stay here until night, you know?

1016
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,560
Let's get more berries.

1017
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,780
Let's rob them of everything they have.

1018
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,740
They didn't even have that much iron or anything like that.

1019
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,000
Oh, they had this too, right?

1020
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,160
I'll take this.

1021
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:05,660
Mine?

1022
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,200
I can't believe you managed to get David Hayter on the server.

1023
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:12,920
You're the best.

1024
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,560
It's me, Steve, from the hit movie Minecraft starring Jack Black.

1025
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,980
Thanks for letting me into the server.

1026
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,540
You're welcome!

1027
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,600
Oh my gosh.

1028
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:39,350
What if the Minecraft movie is really just about me?

1029
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:42,350
Not to seem narcissistic or anything.

1030
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:50,330
But I always said, if I were ever to star in a movie, I would want Jack Black to play me.

1031
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,690
And it could be that they listen to my demands.

1032
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,210
My commands, my demands.

1033
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:00,490
And my plans.

1034
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:08,390
You are Jack Black.

1035
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,250
No, I am Steve.

1036
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:20,720
Do you have any eggs around here?

1037
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,760
Like, where's your chickens?

1038
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,640
I am Steve.

1039
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,480
I am Steve.

1040
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,960
This is actually a pretty nice maintained farm.

1041
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,780
Died right before I finished the snake ass mural.

1042
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:43,920
It's okay.

1043
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,480
You were so close.

1044
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,680
But now you'll never be able to join ever again.

1045
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,220
The server is gone.

1046
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,540
Oh!

1047
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:56,640
Oh!

1048
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,320
Why are there so many creepers in there?

1049
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:08,020
Why are there so an egregious amount of creepers in there?

1050
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,560
I'm trying to find a chicken so I can make some...

1051
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,300
some...

1052
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,160
What's it called?

1053
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,550
What is a group of creepers called?

1054
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:22,570
You know how it's like a murder of crows?

1055
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:25,050
What is a group of creepers called?

1056
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,270
What is a group of creepers called?

1057
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:30,730
Dangerous.

1058
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:30,950
Dangerous.

1059
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:34,490
Just like me, baby.

1060
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,550
I didn't bring any of my stuff.

1061
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:44,330
I didn't bring my crafting table.

1062
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:45,470
I'll just make a new one.

1063
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:48,790
Just make a new one.

1064
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,350
A mint.

1065
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:51,990
A mint.

1066
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,730
She's so cringe.

1067
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:00,930
Yeah, but I'm free!

1068
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:03,550
I'm free!

1069
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:03,970
I'm free!

1070
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:06,370
Look at this!

1071
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:07,990
I'm out here in the world!

1072
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,730
A group of creepers is called a reddit?

1073
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,360
What?

1074
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,520
Like reddit, we did it?

1075
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,120
We did it reddit?

1076
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:30,640
Huh?

1077
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:36,540
Alright.

1078
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,020
Pickaxe.

1079
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,880
I don't have a lot of space!

1080
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,800
I don't have a lot of space!

1081
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,120
Streamer didn't get the joke.

1082
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,420
Streamer didn't get the joke.

1083
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,000
What's... hold on.

1084
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,100
You're right, I didn't.

1085
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,680
Because people in there are creeps!

1086
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,400
That's so mean!

1087
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:07,760
That's so mean!

1088
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,160
That's so mean!

1089
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,180
Hahaha!

1090
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,020
Time for bed!

1091
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,740
Almost time for bed.

1092
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:27,680
Hahaha!

1093
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,860
Don't take my bed.

1094
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,840
Don't do it.

1095
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:35,980
Let's see...

1096
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,160
I don't want to just keep making wood stuff.

1097
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,260
But we need it so I can get a little bit of...

1098
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,420
We need iron.

1099
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:43,900
Okay.

1100
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,260
I don't want to go too far because I have my house.

1101
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,180
And I also want to dig there.

1102
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,600
I truly believe...

1103
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,640
I believe that that is the place that we need to go to.

1104
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,060
Okay?

1105
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,200
But I also want to find...

1106
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,480
I want to find a...

1107
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,300
a chicken.

1108
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,820
Get some eggs.

1109
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,200
Always dig straight down.

1110
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,360
Yeah, I think where the igloo is.

1111
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,880
Basically that area.

1112
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:10,640
Oh!

1113
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,280
Oh!

1114
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:21,110
This is really close to the village.

1115
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:21,650
Are they okay?

1116
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,620
I have nothing.

1117
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,660
I have a sword.

1118
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,600
It's a lie.

1119
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,620
I have one thing.

1120
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,280
I don't see anybody there.

1121
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,080
Maybe it's abandoned.

1122
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,120
Alley!

1123
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,960
This place is so abandoned!

1124
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,520
Ignore that guy right there.

1125
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,840
There's nobody here.

1126
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,820
Free the golem.

1127
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,880
They're gonna kill him.

1128
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,100
Oh, there's... ignore that one right there too.

1129
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,820
He just...

1130
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,200
phase into existence.

1131
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,120
I didn't make a...

1132
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:06,920
Oh!

1133
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:13,780
Alley!

1134
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,360
Which way did I come from?

1135
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,820
This way?

1136
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:23,980
Which way?

1137
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,840
Which Metal Gear is this?

1138
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,140
Okay.

1139
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:36,780
Okay.

1140
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,060
We'll come back.

1141
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,580
Where did I come from?

1142
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,300
There!

1143
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:43,580
There!

1144
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,060
I see.

1145
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:44,280
I see.

1146
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:44,640
I see.

1147
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,260
I see.

1148
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:45,780
I see.

1149
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:46,920
I see.

1150
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:47,540
I see.

1151
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:47,840
I see.

1152
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:48,640
I see.

1153
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,520
I see.

1154
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:49,660
I see.

1155
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:49,920
I see.

1156
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,480
Why is it so hard to find a dang chicken?

1157
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:56,300
Okay.

1158
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,240
Chicken.

1159
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,440
Wolf.

1160
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,580
I just wanna make some pumpkin pie.

1161
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,000
It's like the...

1162
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,720
It's like...

1163
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,800
The minimum I ask for is pumpkin pie.

1164
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,920
In the caves.

1165
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,560
Is that too much to ask for?

1166
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,380
Just to have something... a little sweet treat?

1167
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,480
In the caves?

1168
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,340
You know?

1169
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,560
Is that too much to ask for?

1170
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,080
It's also...

1171
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,020
basically fall.

1172
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,940
So... it's very exciting.

1173
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,620
To have pumpkin pie.

1174
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,400
Or we could go down here.

1175
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,260
Or we could go down here.

1176
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,240
Look at all the iron and stuff.

1177
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,340
Look at all the iron and stuff.

1178
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,780
And the coal.

1179
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:44,640
We need that.

1180
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,900
Which came first?

1181
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,480
The chipkin or the egg?

1182
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,300
The

1183
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,660
egg had to come first.

1184
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,680
The egg had to come first.

1185
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,810
Guys, I feel like I'm on a wild chicken chase.

1186
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,110
Guys, I feel like I'm on a wild chicken chase.

1187
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,770
I would say...

1188
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:13,570
Usually a wild goose chase.

1189
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:14,290
But...

1190
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:16,430
Um...

1191
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:19,910
I'm seriously just wondering...

1192
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,490
Why I can't find a single chicken.

1193
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,590
In this entire game.

1194
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,370
Good joke.

1195
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,750
Give me your eggs!

1196
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,410
Give me your eggs!

1197
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:34,250
Give me your eggs!

1198
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:41,210
We must please them?

1199
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:43,990
I have no...

1200
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,610
I have no...

1201
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,010
I have no...

1202
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:50,370
Seed.

1203
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:57,630
Don't go down there.

1204
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,980
Do I have to have the seed?

1205
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:16,550
Do I have to have the seed?

1206
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:16,630
Do I have to have it?

1207
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,690
I thought they just laid eggs...

1208
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,970
You know...

1209
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:22,850
There you go.

1210
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:23,650
There you go.

1211
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:27,250
Now I...

1212
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:27,890
Now I...

1213
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:29,450
Uh...

1214
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:30,690
Follow, follow, follow.

1215
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,410
I can give you my seed on command.

1216
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:34,730
Just say the word.

1217
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:48,750
Word.

1218
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:50,770
Okay!

1219
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:52,090
Egg!

1220
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,870
Please lay an egg!

1221
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,550
Why is this so hard?

1222
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,250
Why is this so hard?

1223
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:05,610
Why is this so hard?

1224
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:06,730
Please!

1225
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,470
Just give me an egg!

1226
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:09,670
I gave you seed!

1227
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:12,210
Please!

1228
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,370
I'm desperate for egg!

1229
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,350
All I want to have is pumpkin pie.

1230
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,050
In the mines.

1231
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,830
I just want to have a pumpkin pie in the mines.

1232
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,490
I don't even have enough sugar.

1233
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:33,390
I don't even have enough...

1234
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,750
Guys, this is such a failure.

1235
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:38,690
Guys, this is such a failure.

1236
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:44,090
This is why I wanted people This is why I wanted people to do my bidding.

1237
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:46,510
And then I say, okay!

1238
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,390
I'm going off to an adventure, you guys!

1239
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:48,650
going off to an adventure, you guys!

1240
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:55,830
Gather the supplies and everything we need, Gather the supplies and everything we need, and I will be the bread maker.

1241
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:55,870
and I will be the bread maker.

1242
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:56,410
The bread maker.

1243
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:56,550
The pie maker.

1244
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:01,310
Is murder allowed on the Minecraft server?

1245
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,550
There's no Minecraft server.

1246
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:10,170
The pie maker.

1247
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,030
So true!

1248
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:16,750
I wonder if I could take them home.

1249
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,190
What is that?

1250
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:20,850
Oh, it's a bunny.

1251
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,150
Where did they come from?

1252
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:26,590
RNG, gods have forsaken you.

1253
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:30,210
I feel like every time I've seen a chicken, there's always an egg.

1254
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:31,590
Right?

1255
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:33,650
Okay.

1256
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:34,490
Guys, I give up.

1257
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:35,830
We're going back.

1258
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,350
We're going to get some coal.

1259
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:39,270
And iron.

1260
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:40,470
We're going to craft some stuff.

1261
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:40,990
I give up.

1262
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,510
I give up.

1263
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:41,970
I give up.

1264
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,330
I give up on this mission.

1265
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:44,730
This mission is a failure.

1266
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:46,410
Instead, we're going back home.

1267
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:50,430
Look at all these pumpkins!

1268
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,050
They're...

1269
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,170
They look so ripe for the eating.

1270
00:57:57,090 --> 00:58:00,490
Who cares if my pumpkin pie doesn't have egg in it?

1271
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,810
It's still edible, right?

1272
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,030
I got too egg-cited.

1273
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:27,450
How would you feel if a Memboo delivered stuff to you in their...

1274
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:30,010
Their wilds.

1275
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,910
And then Sudoku in front of you.

1276
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:32,990
How...

1277
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:34,930
You...

1278
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:37,470
Why would you do that?

1279
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,750
I mean, it'd be great too, though.

1280
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:44,730
Because then more people can play.

1281
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:50,210
Let me in.

1282
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:50,850
Please.

1283
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,070
Just craft an egg.

1284
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:55,330
This is Minecraft.

1285
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,570
Why can't I craft whatever I please?

1286
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:00,110
That's so true.

1287
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,390
Just craft an egg.

1288
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:04,570
Just follow your fave.

1289
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:07,350
Yeah, I think fall is my favorite.

1290
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:10,630
Because...

1291
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:13,470
It's my birthday!

1292
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:15,250
Okay.

1293
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:18,650
I'm gonna get an axe.

1294
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,850
Start chopping down some stuff too.

1295
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:27,090
Fall gang.

1296
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:30,390
I used to be a really big summer enjoyer, though.

1297
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:34,570
I just like the vibes.

1298
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:35,790
And I'm not someone that like...

1299
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:37,790
Gets like...

1300
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:40,110
You know, I know some people are just like, I can't stand the heat.

1301
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:41,490
But...

1302
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:42,590
Usually...

1303
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:43,990
The heat...

1304
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,470
Doesn't bother me so much sometimes.

1305
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:50,970
How old are you gonna turn?

1306
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:51,790
I'm gonna turn 19!

1307
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,310
Just like last year.

1308
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:55,650
Just like the year before.

1309
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,070
Just like the year before.

1310
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:58,450
Just like the year before.

1311
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:59,810
Just like the year before.

1312
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:01,190
Just like the year before.

1313
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:02,550
Just like the year before.

1314
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:03,910
Just like the year before.

1315
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:05,170
Just like the year before.

1316
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:06,130
And...

1317
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:07,850
Just like the year before!

1318
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,660
Forever young!

1319
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:29,760
Okay.

1320
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,880
I have my bed.

1321
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:32,260
Yeah.

1322
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:37,130
Actually, I'm gonna steal all their torches.

1323
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:44,130
Or I would, if I could...

1324
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:47,090
Rabbit's foot.

1325
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:49,590
We don't need luck.

1326
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:51,390
All we need is pure skill.

1327
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:53,890
We don't need luck.

1328
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:54,550
We don't need luck.

1329
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:59,670
Where is this... where are the...

1330
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:02,170
Where did it go?

1331
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,590
Where did it fly to?

1332
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,900
I can wear the boots?

1333
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,320
Oh, I did get boots!

1334
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:17,900
Thank you!

1335
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:18,820
I didn't realize I had them.

1336
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,740
Where did it go?

1337
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,640
I heard it go...

1338
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,900
So it fell in the water, but like...

1339
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:35,120
Hello, sir.

1340
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:39,800
I'm trying to rob you, but I'm not doing a very good job at it, I think.

1341
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:41,940
Wait!

1342
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:42,620
Did I get it?

1343
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,240
Oh!

1344
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,180
I somehow found it?

1345
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:47,560
Okay.

1346
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,120
Awesome.

1347
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,370
Did I get all of them here?

1348
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:54,710
Okay.

1349
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,190
Gonna grab this one over here.

1350
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,680
More berries.

1351
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,560
Where's the cat?

1352
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:20,910
They have a golem.

1353
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:21,530
They'll be fine.

1354
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:23,010
Where's the cat?

1355
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:25,190
Oh!

1356
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:26,510
It's a little cream kitty!

1357
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:26,590
Kitty!

1358
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,230
They have a golem.

1359
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:31,690
They'll be okay.

1360
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:33,030
Thank you!

1361
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:34,850
Thank you!

1362
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:39,990
Thank you!

1363
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,530
Thank you!

1364
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:46,990
Lots and lots of torches for us.

1365
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,250
Yes.

1366
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:53,770
Okay.

1367
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:06,380
Okay, maybe I should take this blast furnace.

1368
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,900
How are you?

1369
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,160
I'm fine, thank you.

1370
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,280
Min forgot what charcoal is.

1371
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,200
No, wait.

1372
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,440
No, I didn't.

1373
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:28,280
I'm just utilizing my resources.

1374
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,880
We don't have charcoal right now.

1375
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:35,640
So I'm stealing what I need.

1376
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:37,880
Duh!

1377
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:46,350
Sorry, I hope nothing spawns in here for you.

1378
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:48,530
Okay.

1379
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:59,900
Take everything.

1380
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,080
Rob them, rob them, rob them, rob them.

1381
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,040
Rob them of all that they're worth.

1382
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,100
They have a golem, they'll be fine.

1383
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,720
They'll be fine, they'll be fine.

1384
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:18,020
How many do I have?

1385
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:18,840
25!

1386
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,440
Do I need this thing?

1387
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:31,150
Thank you.

1388
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:32,750
Thank you.

1389
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:36,090
What if the villagers could steal the stuff that you drop on the ground?

1390
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:37,090
Are these...

1391
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:40,970
Are these gravestones?

1392
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,280
Jack-o'-lanterns!

1393
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:55,620
That's so crazy!

1394
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:56,840
I've never noticed that.

1395
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,140
Looks like it.

1396
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:01,800
Yeah, right?

1397
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,260
Freaky.

1398
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:10,020
See, if you die in Minecraft, you die in Minecraft!

1399
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,720
It's just the rules, it's the rules.

1400
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,860
Okay, I think I took all their lights that I can see.

1401
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,400
Got 31, that's pretty good.

1402
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,400
There's treasure under the gravestones?

1403
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:21,260
No way.

1404
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,440
I'm now desecrating a grave.

1405
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,280
I have no...

1406
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,960
I have no...

1407
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,720
My morals are gone.

1408
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,880
My morals are absolutely gone.

1409
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:44,260
I

1410
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:48,690
don't see anything.

1411
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,000
Maybe... Oh my gosh.

1412
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,060
You guys, maybe it's like a poetry.

1413
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,040
Right?

1414
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,640
Maybe it's like poetry.

1415
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:09,500
Where I dig here to find that place and I ultimately...

1416
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,320
die and it becomes my own grave.

1417
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:21,690
We have entered the Stone Age.

1418
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:26,530
That's deep.

1419
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:30,330
Yeah, I'm gonna start here for my excavation.

1420
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,800
Oh, oh yeah, okay, I didn't mess it up.

1421
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:44,880
Let's put a torch... there, okay.

1422
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,120
Should I already beat my bet for survival rate?

1423
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,180
Well, I haven't really done anything, so...

1424
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,400
I think it doesn't count.

1425
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,180
I haven't really... I'm just now digging for the first time.

1426
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:06,220
Okay.

1427
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,360
I'm gonna put this here.

1428
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:10,500
Yeah.

1429
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:11,760
Alright.

1430
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,580
Alive is alive.

1431
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,240
Alright, here we go.

1432
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,500
Into the mo... into the mines.

1433
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,580
Into the caves.

1434
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,860
Digging under a grave.

1435
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,160
Yes.

1436
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:42,740
Do I have... okay, I have probably an okay amount of wood.

1437
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,840
We yearn for the mines.

1438
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,220
We yearn for the mines.

1439
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,960
The children yearn for the mines.

1440
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,480
Wooden pickaxe is paying.

1441
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:00,220
Um, yeah, I'll get another one eventually.

1442
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:01,960
Probably.

1443
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:11,770
I mean, it's gonna break.

1444
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:14,270
I just don't wanna waste it, you know?

1445
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:16,790
Let's go down one more.

1446
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:20,530
Deeper into the mines.

1447
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:23,210
Into the caves we go.

1448
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:26,270
Deeper and deeper.

1449
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:30,290
Deeper and deeper.

1450
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:33,110
Deeper and deeper and deeper.

1451
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:43,900
Do you think it's night time?

1452
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:49,150
I'm getting scared.

1453
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:49,710
Don't get scared!

1454
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:50,270
Don't get scared!

1455
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:50,790
Don't be scared!

1456
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:51,270
Don't be scared!

1457
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:55,790
Okay, good.

1458
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,660
This was such a lie.

1459
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:08,420
Treasure under the grave.

1460
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:08,760
What?

1461
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,520
I was bamboozled.

1462
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,640
Thank you for being my oshi.

1463
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,300
Awww, Forest!

1464
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:22,500
Thank you for having me as your oshi!

1465
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,600
Wrong grave?

1466
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:27,800
Really?

1467
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:28,420
Really?

1468
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,140
No egg under the grave.

1469
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,020
Oh, I have this.

1470
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,160
I'm gonna put some stuff here.

1471
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,080
Not my meat.

1472
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,520
I'll put the flint in.

1473
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,620
I can set things on fire with this, actually.

1474
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,380
I can be pretty thrifty.

1475
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,260
Um, um, um, um.

1476
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,460
These both have silk touch, which is kind of fascinating.

1477
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,520
Let's, uh, put this down real quick.

1478
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,220
I'm gonna... I do wanna get some more, um...

1479
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,000
I do wanna get some more wood before we continue further, further.

1480
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,240
Put this right here.

1481
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,620
And right there.

1482
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,160
Let's try this.

1483
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,700
You think there's anything under this one?

1484
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,000
There's gotta be someone somewhere!

1485
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,180
Treasure!

1486
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:24,920
Treasure!

1487
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:25,320
Treasure!

1488
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:25,520
Treasure!

1489
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,240
Treasure under the grave!

1490
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,160
Treasure in the grave!

1491
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:41,910
Nothing.

1492
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,010
This is so messed up!

1493
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:50,230
What?

1494
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,270
I just casually become a grave robber?

1495
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:53,550
What if something spawns in there?

1496
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:55,050
Then it'll really be a grave.

1497
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:56,970
Oh wait, I don't want him to be able to get out.

1498
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:58,250
Here we go, okay.

1499
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:01,230
I was joking!

1500
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:01,990
I have no idea!

1501
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:17,290
I'm gonna become a grave robber.

1502
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:32,440
Can I get some words of encouragement for the big rig driver?

1503
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:37,140
Currently trying and failing to maneuver around the gas station near my work.

1504
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,500
Thoughts and prayers.

1505
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:41,160
Thoughts and prayers.

1506
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:44,660
Um.

1507
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:46,440
It's not...

1508
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,020
about the size.

1509
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:51,040
It's about the mental fortitude.

1510
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,380
You can do anything.

1511
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:58,500
If you just keep moving and trying.

1512
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,840
I'm heading to the gym.

1513
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:03,360
Do you have any motiva- Why is everybody asking for motivational words?

1514
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,120
Inspire the people.

1515
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,720
Scared me.

1516
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:25,480
Inspiration.

1517
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,300
What do you want for your birthday?

1518
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,260
Hmmmm...

1519
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:34,280
I don't know.

1520
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:35,580
I don't really want anything.

1521
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,240
You sound like my mom.

1522
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:43,280
She's like, what do you want for your birthday?

1523
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:44,900
I was like, I don't know.

1524
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,120
Uh.

1525
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:49,140
I basically got everything that I want.

1526
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,020
Okay, hold on.

1527
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:51,840
Um, alright.

1528
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,900
So, 38.

1529
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,960
Um, let's see.

1530
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:57,860
Throw this away.

1531
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:01,620
Payment.

1532
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:02,300
Could I get words?

1533
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:03,240
Any words?

1534
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:04,280
Any words?

1535
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:04,960
Any words?

1536
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,740
Any words!

1537
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,080
Wo- Any words?

1538
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:08,880
Any words?

1539
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:10,660
Any words?

1540
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,240
Any words?

1541
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:12,980
Any words?

1542
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:16,620
Um...

1543
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,120
Why are we still talking about the Wisp Server?

1544
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,280
Why are we still talking about the Wisp Server?

1545
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,760
They won't let me in, you guys.

1546
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,060
I guess I don't need emeralds.

1547
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,680
A dead man doesn't need money.

1548
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:39,960
I'm done with my workload.

1549
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,440
And I have 30 minutes on the clock.

1550
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:45,940
Can you give me some inspiring words on how to survive this corporate hell?

1551
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:52,720
Oh, any words, any words, any words, any words, any words, any words...

1552
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,380
What else did I throw away?

1553
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:54,720
Oh, this.

1554
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,740
No, to get through the workday...

1555
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,200
Wait, did I?

1556
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:08,460
Hold on.

1557
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:08,880
Sorry.

1558
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,440
I keep forgetting what I'm trying to do.

1559
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,620
To get through the workday...

1560
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,760
Honestly, it's so crazy how long...

1561
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:24,180
Have you guys ever set... like you heat something in the microwave or something...

1562
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:28,580
And then you put it for like 30 seconds and then 30 seconds goes by and you're like...

1563
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,700
How is this... how is this...

1564
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,720
How was I able to do so much in 30 seconds?

1565
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:36,720
You know?

1566
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,320
Motivational words for the monkeys struggling to defend the map.

1567
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:46,620
Pray to Ice Monkey.

1568
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:49,500
And thou shall succeed.

1569
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,220
Thank you, thank you.

1570
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:53,820
Chu!

1571
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,980
Feeling super chipper.

1572
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,460
Can you give me some demotivating words of discouragement?

1573
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:05,540
Um...

1574
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,080
You!

1575
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,700
Probably are...

1576
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:12,860
Iron!

1577
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,120
You are happy and that's...

1578
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:17,100
So annoying and bad.

1579
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:18,180
And...

1580
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:20,360
You...

1581
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:24,140
Have a stupid face when you smile.

1582
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,040
Probably.

1583
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,980
Was that too mean?

1584
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,680
Sorry, that was really mean, wasn't she?

1585
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,860
Wasn't that... wasn't that... wasn't that...

1586
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,200
Wasn't that too mean?

1587
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:36,140
Okay, hold on.

1588
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:36,720
Sorry.

1589
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,040
You are a stupid...

1590
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,480
You are a stupid.

1591
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:48,580
You...

1592
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:48,780
You...

1593
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:50,560
Um.

1594
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,280
Go watch...

1595
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,860
Go watch some videos...

1596
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,260
Go watch some videos... of...

1597
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:56,940
of...

1598
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:57,520
go watch some videos...

1599
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:57,520
of...

1600
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,520
of a sad puppy.

1601
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:02,160
Chu gacha.

1602
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:02,360
Chu gacha.

1603
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,340
Sorry Ashes.

1604
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:05,900
Sorry Ashes.

1605
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:09,610
Oh!

1606
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:09,690
Oh?

1607
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:11,130
Glow squid?

1608
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:11,750
Swimming?

1609
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:14,290
I hear some strange noises.

1610
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:19,450
Yeah!

1611
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,250
We got Cole!

1612
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:24,710
You really got him.

1613
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,990
No, we've never heard from Ducky ever again.

1614
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:35,330
When they said she hates us...

1615
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:38,490
When they said she hates us...

1616
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:42,290
Who could have thunk it would be to this extent?

1617
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:47,130
But I'm watching a sad puppy play Minecraft.

1618
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:48,210
What are you talking about?

1619
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:49,930
I don't have puppy energy at all.

1620
01:16:55,310 --> 01:17:00,430
Listening to you rambling to chat with ChillBGM on Minecraft is like peak Minecraft I've missed.

1621
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:02,490
I'm glad.

1622
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:10,380
Chihuahua?

1623
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,700
Why are you guys saying X?

1624
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,520
What kind of animal energy?

1625
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:15,340
Do I exude?

1626
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,980
More like wet cat energy.

1627
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:33,110
Like a cat.

1628
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:35,170
Okay, hold on.

1629
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:35,870
Let's go back upstairs.

1630
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,200
She hates us is cat energy.

1631
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,580
Let's put this here.

1632
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,450
Wet cat energy is...

1633
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:07,030
Diabolical.

1634
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:15,790
That is so... I feel like I should be offended.

1635
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:26,270
Get a happy birthday song.

1636
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:29,350
Something that I could twerk with.

1637
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:33,950
Okay.

1638
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:38,990
Happy birth.

1639
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:40,590
Day to you.

1640
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:42,290
Happy birth.

1641
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:43,890
Day to you.

1642
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:45,710
Happy birth.

1643
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:47,370
Day to you.

1644
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:49,030
Happy birth.

1645
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:50,630
Day to you.

1646
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,300
Happy birthday, ba bang!

1647
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:58,440
Ba bang.

1648
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:02,720
Sick remix.

1649
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,020
Break it down.

1650
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,600
Oh, no.

1651
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:06,540
It's the wrong type.

1652
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,180
They had a regular.

1653
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:08,680
Oh, wait.

1654
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:09,360
No, I had one.

1655
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,760
I had a furnace at home.

1656
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,720
You guys, this is hardcore.

1657
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:13,400
We're not...

1658
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,900
We're not wasting resources.

1659
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:19,900
So I have to go get it from my house, which is hopefully not destroyed.

1660
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,420
Why is...

1661
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:32,380
Why do boats sink?

1662
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,820
DJ Minto in the house.

1663
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,160
Ever considered playing mod in Minecraft?

1664
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:44,740
Yes.

1665
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,520
Well, I tried it on like the Vshojo server.

1666
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,920
I think maybe just because I'm not used to it.

1667
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,420
I'm so used to vanilla Minecraft.

1668
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:57,500
And then the amount of mods they had kind of made me overwhelmed.

1669
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,980
But I would be willing to try it, you know.

1670
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,740
Yeah, I did get a bit short circuited.

1671
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:14,980
Yeah.

1672
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,180
Not my birthday, but can I get a birthday congratulations from...

1673
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:21,900
Happy birthday.

1674
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,140
Congratulations.

1675
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,200
Happy birthday.

1676
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,200
Salutations.

1677
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,900
Happy birthday.

1678
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,460
May your sky stay blue.

1679
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,920
Happy birthday to you.

1680
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,480
That's the only correct birthday song now.

1681
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,760
Whoever's birthday it was for that.

1682
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,860
We never even checked over here.

1683
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:54,600
That's fine.

1684
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,760
We're digging and digging and digging now.

1685
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:00,580
Take this one too.

1686
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,400
Playing with mods for years, I'm used to it.

1687
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:11,340
Yeah.

1688
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,420
I think if you play, you know, like I said, if you're used to it, then it makes total sense.

1689
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,980
But for me, I was just like, I don't know.

1690
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,620
I don't know any of this.

1691
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,160
And it's so much.

1692
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,080
It's all at once.

1693
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:33,240
I was like, went from being little vanilla bear.

1694
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:33,480
Baby.

1695
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:35,820
To everything.

1696
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,550
Almost forgot to like.

1697
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:43,870
Like the stream.

1698
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:46,610
Comment on the video.

1699
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:47,790
Oh.

1700
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:54,110
I was going to say, what's your favorite vanilla moment?

1701
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:57,090
What's your favorite flavor of Minecraft?

1702
01:21:57,510 --> 01:22:00,930
I personally prefer a chocolate.

1703
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:05,150
What else do I need?

1704
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,310
I think we're okay for now.

1705
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:11,190
Oh, wait.

1706
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:11,570
Yeah.

1707
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:13,830
We got our furnace.

1708
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:15,610
I'll take the blast furnace too.

1709
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:18,950
Oh.

1710
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:19,770
Oh.

1711
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:20,810
Oh.

1712
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:21,650
Oh.

1713
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:22,970
Oh.

1714
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:23,550
Oh.

1715
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:24,230
Oh.

1716
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:24,810
Oh.

1717
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:24,910
Oh.

1718
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:25,290
Oh.

1719
01:22:25,370 --> 01:22:26,950
I need the blast furnace.

1720
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:30,230
Throw.

1721
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:33,430
Throw.

1722
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:34,730
And heal.

1723
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:35,130
Throw.

1724
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:35,810
And cook.

1725
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:37,090
There we go.

1726
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:39,470
Yes.

1727
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:40,670
Yes.

1728
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:41,270
Oh.

1729
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:41,690
Oh.

1730
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:45,250
It's nighttime, but I think we'll be okay.

1731
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:52,370
Put the stairs and leather gear in the chest.

1732
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:52,950
No.

1733
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:54,590
I want those.

1734
01:22:57,530 --> 01:22:58,950
It's my stairs.

1735
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:00,890
What if I need them?

1736
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,230
I'm here playing.

1737
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:04,350
I'm hardcore server.

1738
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:06,790
Is anyone else going to show up?

1739
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:07,470
No.

1740
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:08,130
No.

1741
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:08,990
I'll be back in a moment.

1742
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:14,210
What else was I going to...

1743
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:14,390
Oh, here.

1744
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:17,790
Nice.

1745
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:19,690
Bidding.

1746
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:24,910
I see creepers.

1747
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:28,590
And I'm not looking in the chat.

1748
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:30,970
I see skellies.

1749
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:34,190
Oh, I see skellies getting attacked by dogs.

1750
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:38,730
How did you know I was here?

1751
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:40,090
Fall in.

1752
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:40,790
I'm coming.

1753
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:41,810
I'm coming.

1754
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:56,130
I just made a Reddit joke, was it good?

1755
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:03,950
No, don't go in my place!

1756
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:04,630
That's my hole!

1757
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:08,910
They can fall in this one though, if they want.

1758
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:13,110
Okay, we got some...

1759
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:22,070
I think we should... oh wait, I want to take this home with me.

1760
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:23,710
What

1761
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:33,390
do I not need?

1762
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:36,330
Okay, I definitely need the stairs, I definitely need the leather.

1763
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:43,250
I got the birthday song right after doing loads of missions all the way to wear quiet lip.

1764
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:47,230
I thought it was some extra kick in the teeth after the emotional love point of those missions.

1765
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:49,370
I didn't realize it was my birthday.

1766
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:50,930
No way!

1767
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:53,930
Do you think someone will follow me in here?

1768
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,310
I hope not.

1769
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:57,930
No freaks better follow me in here.

1770
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:16,670
Okie dokie, is this where I actually stopped?

1771
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:18,250
Oh yeah, because we found a bunch of coal.

1772
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:18,630
Okay.

1773
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,300
I'll put a thing there.

1774
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:25,640
Okay.

1775
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:26,760
Ah!

1776
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:28,380
Water!

1777
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,880
We got the water.

1778
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,700
Maybe I should make a better sword.

1779
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,100
I just realized too.

1780
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:40,840
Maybe I should... make... a better sword.

1781
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:44,100
It's optional, but you know.

1782
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,300
I think we're gonna die in here.

1783
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:50,180
Hmm.

1784
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,360
I need one of...

1785
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:53,580
Ahh!

1786
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:09,170
Iron soul!

1787
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:14,110
Iron sword.

1788
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:15,830
Okay.

1789
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:20,630
What is going on Chief?

1790
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:24,650
Okay.

1791
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:36,950
I don't see any... things that will help us hold.

1792
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:38,030
You know...?

1793
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:41,690
The blocks, the... Of course the...

1794
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:43,450
You know, the blocks in Minecraft.

1795
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:44,270
Those ones.

1796
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:47,230
What are they?

1797
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:48,370
What are they?

1798
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:50,090
What are they called?

1799
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:55,610
Use a door.

1800
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:57,350
Oh, thank you.

1801
01:26:57,450 --> 01:26:58,030
You're so right.

1802
01:26:58,170 --> 01:26:58,870
That's why I have these.

1803
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,560
What was that sound?

1804
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,260
What was that sound?

1805
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:07,740
Why did it sound so mysterious?

1806
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:11,580
What was that?

1807
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:12,080
I was like...

1808
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:15,300
Creepy.

1809
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,020
Drowned?

1810
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,480
I don't think so.

1811
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:43,650
Herobrine.

1812
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:46,310
Gosh,

1813
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:51,910
I hope the little villages are okay up there.

1814
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:54,590
Some crazy...

1815
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:57,530
Some crazy thunder right now.

1816
01:28:00,050 --> 01:28:01,290
Let's go this way.

1817
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:14,590
I didn't even notice.

1818
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:16,430
We're fine.

1819
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:18,030
Everything's good.

1820
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:19,830
There's some iron there.

1821
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,750
Okay, downward, onward.

1822
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:26,130
Oh, gosh.

1823
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:29,370
Oh, we're like really deep, aren't we?

1824
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:29,770
Oh, gosh.

1825
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:30,050
Okay.

1826
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:31,330
Let me in.

1827
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:32,450
Let me in, please.

1828
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:40,830
Stop giving me a heart attack, Minto.

1829
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:41,810
I'm trying to just...

1830
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:42,990
I'm just trying to play the game.

1831
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:44,790
Okay.

1832
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:48,910
What if I...

1833
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:49,970
Wait.

1834
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:50,730
Oh, there we go.

1835
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:52,430
What if I dig here, you know?

1836
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:55,670
We got some iron even.

1837
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:57,970
Nice.

1838
01:28:57,970 --> 01:28:58,530
I'll take it.

1839
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:01,650
I'll take it.

1840
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:02,030
I'll take it.

1841
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:02,370
I'll take it.

1842
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:02,670
I'll take it.

1843
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:06,270
I have a full inventory, but that's okay.

1844
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:08,230
I could just eat the pumpkin pie.

1845
01:29:10,030 --> 01:29:11,090
My pumpkin pie.

1846
01:29:12,730 --> 01:29:13,450
Just kidding.

1847
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:17,850
We're gonna dig here.

1848
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:20,790
We're gonna dig here, okay, everybody?

1849
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:35,170
We're gonna keep digging.

1850
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:37,030
I'm not gonna let this deter me.

1851
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:40,990
I'm not gonna let this deter me.

1852
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:44,770
Iron pickaxe.

1853
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:45,310
See?

1854
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:45,910
See?

1855
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:47,410
We're doing it.

1856
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:50,690
Do you think it's...

1857
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:52,690
Aha!

1858
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:56,110
This is it, everybody.

1859
01:29:58,210 --> 01:29:59,850
This is the strip mining.

1860
01:30:04,450 --> 01:30:05,310
Oh, shoot.

1861
01:30:10,930 --> 01:30:11,990
Okay, hold on.

1862
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:17,050
Let's go back for this.

1863
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:19,430
We're doing it.

1864
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:22,890
Gosh, it is really crazy up there.

1865
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:24,210
Did I grab it?

1866
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:25,030
No.

1867
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:27,610
Throw you away.

1868
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:28,070
Okay.

1869
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:32,650
I want this iron, though.

1870
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:34,010
What do I need?

1871
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:35,050
Oh, don't need the gravel.

1872
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:36,750
Iron.

1873
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:37,530
Iron.

1874
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:38,550
Iron.

1875
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:39,130
Iron.

1876
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:45,210
Okay.

1877
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:47,010
Don't drown, please.

1878
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:48,470
I won't.

1879
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:49,390
We're okay.

1880
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:50,730
Everything's fine.

1881
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:52,530
Everything's all good.

1882
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:55,850
Everything's so okay.

1883
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,220
Drop the Leather Mint.

1884
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:05,680
No, I want it.

1885
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,520
You can't force me.

1886
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,600
You can't make me leave it.

1887
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,380
More water?

1888
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:14,360
Come on.

1889
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:14,660
Come on.

1890
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,120
Eerie noise.

1891
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,460
What does it mean by that?

1892
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:24,560
Oh my gosh.

1893
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:25,480
I can't even get through.

1894
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:36,410
Excuse me.

1895
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:38,910
Oh my gosh.

1896
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:39,990
Are you under the ocean?

1897
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:40,710
I don't think so.

1898
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:42,790
I don't think so.

1899
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:43,350
I don't think so.

1900
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,040
We're gonna find the trial.

1901
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:50,500
Wait.

1902
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:51,820
Oh, this is the only door I have.

1903
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:52,200
Okay, yeah.

1904
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,040
We're gonna find the trial chambers.

1905
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:00,680
Okay.

1906
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,320
This is a dead end.

1907
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,220
We'll change our direction.

1908
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,120
Change directions.

1909
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,820
How do I...

1910
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:16,780
Where's my hole?

1911
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:17,980
Wait a second.

1912
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:18,560
Where's my hole?

1913
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:19,560
Oh.

1914
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:21,300
Guys.

1915
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,480
Guys, where did I come from?

1916
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,260
Oh.

1917
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:27,660
Wait.

1918
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,140
I found it.

1919
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,640
I see my hole.

1920
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,620
I see my hole.

1921
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:35,780
Everything is fine.

1922
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:45,180
Let's go...

1923
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,460
this way.

1924
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,000
Surely, there'll be no water here.

1925
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,900
Surely, it'll be okay.

1926
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:10,870
Guys, isn't this so exciting?

1927
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:12,710
What if we even find diamond down here?

1928
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:16,890
That'll be a little special treat for us, right?

1929
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:30,250
Maybe I should go up a little bit.

1930
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:37,150
Is it usually... is the trial chamber usually deep?

1931
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:39,170
Or is it like...

1932
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:44,590
I imagine it's probably deep like the...

1933
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:49,540
What's it called?

1934
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:52,880
Go lower?

1935
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:54,140
Wait, what are we at even?

1936
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:54,840
Oh my goodness.

1937
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:56,300
We're at four!

1938
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,100
Deep slate level.

1939
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:01,120
So yeah, we're where exactly we need to be.

1940
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:04,840
I will go down a little bit actually.

1941
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,320
We can go down lower.

1942
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,100
I can always go lower.

1943
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:10,600
Heretic!

1944
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,320
Thank you so much for the 20 gift.

1945
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:12,820
Thank you!

1946
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:16,840
Why is there dirt here?

1947
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:26,490
This is a lot of dirt.

1948
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:27,810
For all the way down here?

1949
01:34:40,530 --> 01:34:41,330
Where are

1950
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:48,550
the diamonds?

1951
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:50,030
Why is there so much dirt here?

1952
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:54,530
Why is there so much dirt?

1953
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:59,370
Dirt doesn't usually form this deep, doesn't it?

1954
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:00,750
Hmm...

1955
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:08,380
I'm gonna... my shovel's gonna break because it's made of gold and gold is useless.

1956
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:16,010
Dirt biome.

1957
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:18,050
Oh my gosh.

1958
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:20,690
Dirty, nasty.

1959
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:25,910
I started a new...

1960
01:35:27,070 --> 01:35:29,390
I started the billionaire secret baby.

1961
01:35:30,490 --> 01:35:32,550
But I keep falling asleep to it.

1962
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:35,490
I've tried... I've tried for like the past two nights.

1963
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:39,290
I keep falling asleep to it.

1964
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:46,290
So I haven't... I have no idea at all what's going on.

1965
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:51,330
I woke up this morning and it was like last chapter.

1966
01:35:57,870 --> 01:35:58,830
The howa?

1967
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:00,290
So...

1968
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:02,930
For those who don't know...

1969
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:04,690
I...

1970
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:06,960
You know, a long time ago...

1971
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:13,010
One of my... one of my office working jobs...

1972
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:16,050
I would listen to...

1973
01:36:16,050 --> 01:36:17,010
Okay, I think we're deep enough.

1974
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:18,050
Negative 18.

1975
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:20,370
We can... we can go like this now.

1976
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:24,370
I would listen to sexy romance novels.

1977
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:25,870
Just for funsies.

1978
01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:30,130
And...

1979
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:36,530
I started one.

1980
01:36:38,570 --> 01:36:40,730
It's like kind of my hobby, I guess you'd say.

1981
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:43,050
Oh no!

1982
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,560
Oh, that was a creepy noise.

1983
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:54,640
It's quite creepy.

1984
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,420
Let's get a...

1985
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,140
Wait, what am I missing?

1986
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,620
First of all, I'm gonna throw this away.

1987
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:04,160
Actually, no.

1988
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:05,780
I'm gonna keep this for attacking.

1989
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:08,540
We need...

1990
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:15,100
I'm gonna throw the sugar away because we'll never get any eggs.

1991
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:17,740
Goodbye, goodbye.

1992
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:20,080
Actually, I want the pumpkins.

1993
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:23,920
Sticks.

1994
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:30,870
Do I wanna make an iron shovel?

1995
01:37:31,170 --> 01:37:32,610
No, I'll just go with the stone shovel.

1996
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:34,310
Not the sugar.

1997
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:35,930
Please, the leather.

1998
01:37:37,530 --> 01:37:38,050
No...

1999
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:39,650
I want that.

2000
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:40,710
.

2001
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:44,850
He finally got out of the station.

2002
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:45,590
Let's go!

2003
01:37:46,710 --> 01:37:48,310
Can I join the conversation?

2004
01:37:50,290 --> 01:37:50,870
Yes, Jerry.

2005
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:51,490
Of course you can.

2006
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:55,130
What do you have to offer for this conversation?

2007
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:58,150
I wanna know everything.

2008
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:59,390
I wanna know what you're thinking.

2009
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:02,630
I wanna know what's on your mind.

2010
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:04,690
You guys, what's on your mind?

2011
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:32,510
That's amazing.

2012
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:32,930
Okay, let's see because this is going to be really boring.

2013
01:38:32,930 --> 01:38:37,030
Let's just say that we're gonna do it!

2014
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:37,430
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it!

2015
01:38:37,690 --> 01:38:37,870
Let's do it!

2016
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:40,970
Do you have any chance for some kind of freaky phantom frequency for fall?

2017
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:44,530
I don't know.

2018
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:53,150
I love doing the podcast, but I also don't think it's really something for me.

2019
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:57,710
Because I just...

2020
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:02,330
I've mentioned it on the podcast, but like...

2021
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:07,830
I feel like I use up all my social energy on the podcast.

2022
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:09,550
When I would do it.

2023
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:13,130
I'm thinking about them beans.

2024
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:15,750
I love that.

2025
01:39:15,850 --> 01:39:19,170
Oh my gosh, you know what I've been non-stop watching recently?

2026
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:21,950
You know how like...

2027
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:26,470
Have you guys seen that people are using AI to...

2028
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:27,950
Okay, that's not...

2029
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:32,230
That's not Diamond, but...

2030
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:35,750
They've been using AI on vines and stuff.

2031
01:39:35,890 --> 01:39:37,970
Or like TikToks and things.

2032
01:39:38,110 --> 01:39:39,210
To make them longer.

2033
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:43,570
I've been watching people...

2034
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:46,210
You know what, maybe I should go this way.

2035
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:54,030
I've been watching people making fun of those AI generated videos.

2036
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:57,030
By making their own.

2037
01:39:57,970 --> 01:39:58,670
Oh shoot.

2038
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:03,410
Oh no.

2039
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:08,710
And so I've been watching those a lot.

2040
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:12,090
They're so funny.

2041
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:13,630
Oh, I didn't leave this here.

2042
01:40:13,710 --> 01:40:14,370
I'm so stupid.

2043
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:14,790
Sorry.

2044
01:40:17,770 --> 01:40:19,310
I like the imposter showing up.

2045
01:40:19,330 --> 01:40:21,150
Yes, they're so funny.

2046
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:25,830
I've been watching people making the parodies of them.

2047
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:30,010
Where is this guy?

2048
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:31,650
It's not so close.

2049
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:36,210
Oh, there's some iron though.

2050
01:40:37,850 --> 01:40:38,530
Take it.

2051
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:38,690
Oh, there's some iron though.

2052
01:40:40,050 --> 01:40:42,170
Oh, it sounds right next to me.

2053
01:40:51,190 --> 01:40:53,150
He wants to tell us what's on his mind.

2054
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,960
He wants to tell us what's on his mind.

2055
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:02,780
He wants to tell us what's on his mind.

2056
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:04,800
He's on ASMR.

2057
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:17,080
Let's put our blast furnace right here.

2058
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:18,160
Let's put our blast furnace right here.

2059
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:22,020
And we're gonna make this iron.

2060
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:22,420
And we're gonna make this iron.

2061
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:24,140
Very good, very good, very good.

2062
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,800
Remember when content slop was handmade like Spiderman Elsa videos?

2063
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:40,940
Can you imagine the amount of Spiderman Elsa stuff they can make now?

2064
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:45,380
I was gonna say it's almost terrifying to think about.

2065
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,320
But actually it's quite terrifying to think about.

2066
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:49,400
It's not almost terrifying.

2067
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:52,900
Where are these guys?

2068
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:53,740
Are they above me?

2069
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:54,240
Below me?

2070
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:06,370
Something about the...

2071
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:10,750
Where are they?

2072
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:12,190
I think it's above me.

2073
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:23,210
It sounds so close!

2074
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,800
I don't wanna let them in, but...

2075
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:35,530
Never dig above.

2076
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,460
Well, we're close to somewhere.

2077
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,000
Well, we're close to somewhere.

2078
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:45,020
Blair...

2079
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,700
Our soup for being 70% water.

2080
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:52,260
Our ghost chowder for being mostly ectoplasm.

2081
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:57,800
Delicious.

2082
01:42:58,860 --> 01:42:59,380
Chowder.

2083
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:05,360
I'm trying to find them!

2084
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,400
I seriously can't.

2085
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:11,160
I'm just gonna block this up though.

2086
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:13,660
I don't feel like adding more torches.

2087
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:16,600
I don't wanna waste torches.

2088
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:25,860
Chowder.

2089
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,480
Like a minty chowder sounds kind of awful though.

2090
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:32,260
Like a minty chowder sounds kind of awful though.

2091
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:35,360
But not all ghosts are mint flavored.

2092
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:36,640
Just me.

2093
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,940
To the right.

2094
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:48,080
I checked though.

2095
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:53,460
Wow guys, we're level 5.

2096
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:54,160
Wow guys, we're level 5.

2097
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:56,860
I'll try going to the right.

2098
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:59,500
But they're also on my left.

2099
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:06,460
Where the...

2100
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:08,780
Would zombies be in the trial room?

2101
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:09,180
Would zombies be in the trial room?

2102
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,840
What flavor are wisps?

2103
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:14,500
I like that...

2104
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:15,620
Ramune.

2105
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,160
Oh oh, I hear...

2106
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:20,840
Oh oh.

2107
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,180
I hear lava.

2108
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:26,840
I hear lava.

2109
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:30,660
Ramune?

2110
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:30,840
Ramune?

2111
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:31,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2112
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:38,580
We're far from the...

2113
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:41,560
We're far from the zombies now.

2114
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:48,270
They must be above me.

2115
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:53,310
What does ramune taste like?

2116
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:53,730
What?

2117
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:59,460
Have you guys never had the ramune...

2118
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:02,470
I can't have soda, but in Japan...

2119
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:07,640
Ramune is a very popular flavored candy and stuff.

2120
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,520
So those I have.

2121
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:13,260
And...

2122
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:15,200
It's very...

2123
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,840
It's very...

2124
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,180
But this

2125
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:27,720
doesn't look like a trial chamber.

2126
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:30,580
I can't have soda.

2127
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:35,020
It messes with the ectoplasm in my tummy.

2128
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,040
And I just kind of throw up.

2129
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:45,440
Minto is surprised we're uncultured.

2130
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:46,560
I don't think it's uncultured.

2131
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,780
It's just... It's like a distinct like...

2132
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:50,920
How do I describe it?

2133
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,300
Oh wait.

2134
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:56,100
Hold on.

2135
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:58,240
Before we do this...

2136
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:01,440
I'm gonna go make a shield.

2137
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:05,740
I thought about this earlier.

2138
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:07,620
Yeah.

2139
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:11,400
Oh, goodbye sugar.

2140
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:15,200
We're living a healthy diet now.

2141
01:46:29,470 --> 01:46:30,550
Oh, wait.

2142
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:31,470
The zombies are...

2143
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:33,010
Not here.

2144
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:33,810
Maybe.

2145
01:46:38,530 --> 01:46:39,350
Guys!

2146
01:46:54,620 --> 01:46:56,200
We did it!

2147
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:57,660
We did it!

2148
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:01,720
Yipee!

2149
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,260
Yipee!

2150
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:03,060
Yipee!

2151
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:09,400
Um...

2152
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:09,620
Um...

2153
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:12,500
Alright.

2154
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:14,720
If I were a trial chamber...

2155
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:16,900
Someone said that I need like a cartographer.

2156
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:19,560
But unfortunately...

2157
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:22,060
That village did not have one.

2158
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:23,000
You know?

2159
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:25,860
So...

2160
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:27,760
I think we just gotta...

2161
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:29,720
You know...

2162
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:31,440
Find it...

2163
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:33,860
Somehow.

2164
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:37,820
Oh, I hear a skelly.

2165
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:41,000
From over here?

2166
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:42,040
No.

2167
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:48,580
Towards where I'm going though.

2168
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:50,640
Oh, let me go get my stuff.

2169
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:03,660
What can I throw away?

2170
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:05,500
Oh.

2171
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:06,600
Plenty of stuff.

2172
01:48:10,270 --> 01:48:11,270
And... yup.

2173
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:12,170
Perfect.

2174
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:12,850
Alright.

2175
01:48:14,530 --> 01:48:15,030
Alright.

2176
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:17,870
Can make a cartography table...

2177
01:48:17,870 --> 01:48:18,450
And convert one.

2178
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:20,510
But don't I need...

2179
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:21,190
Um...

2180
01:48:23,770 --> 01:48:24,110
Um...

2181
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:27,410
Oh, I get what you guys mean!

2182
01:48:27,790 --> 01:48:29,270
Oh, so we should go back, huh?

2183
01:48:30,650 --> 01:48:32,070
Because there's the guys...

2184
01:48:32,650 --> 01:48:33,010
Oh...

2185
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:33,730
Wait.

2186
01:48:33,950 --> 01:48:35,530
Is it so easy to find one though?

2187
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:37,810
There's a glitch where you throw...

2188
01:48:37,810 --> 01:48:39,290
Your diamonds into lava, they will multiply?

2189
01:48:40,170 --> 01:48:40,530
Stop!

2190
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:46,580
It's pretty cheap?

2191
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:47,160
Okay, okay.

2192
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:47,900
Back to the village!

2193
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:49,880
Back to the village!

2194
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:54,900
Okay.

2195
01:48:55,540 --> 01:48:56,960
It's not so far, I think.

2196
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:59,480
We just went through some water.

2197
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:01,200
This way.

2198
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:03,200
And...

2199
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:05,080
And...

2200
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:06,540
And...

2201
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:08,660
We...

2202
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:11,360
Went...

2203
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:14,000
Wait, I never thought I would be going back.

2204
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,640
Oh, wait!

2205
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:16,980
This might be good, actually.

2206
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:22,120
Yes!

2207
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:23,260
This is actually very good.

2208
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:28,840
It's hard to find coal so deep, you know?

2209
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:31,580
Grab it while we can.

2210
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:31,980
Grab it while we can.

2211
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:34,600
Press Alt F4.

2212
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:41,230
Press Alt F4!

2213
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:43,210
Right now, everybody.

2214
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:46,070
Do it, or you're not really a fan.

2215
01:49:47,910 --> 01:49:48,350
Do it, or you're not really a fan.

2216
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:53,210
Do it, or you hate me.

2217
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:00,220
Did I get all of it?

2218
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:00,660
I think so.

2219
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:01,500
Did I get all of it?

2220
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:01,500
I think so.

2221
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,440
Do it, or you hate me.

2222
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:05,840
It's not that hard to get rid of the love or not feeling.

2223
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:07,180
Here we go.

2224
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:08,620
I'm not seeing...

2225
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:09,700
Oh.

2226
01:50:11,660 --> 01:50:12,460
I'm not...

2227
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:15,080
Oh, I just saw a drop of viewership, for real!

2228
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:28,540
Oh my gosh, you guys are such real ones!

2229
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:37,730
Oh my gosh, stop, you guys!

2230
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:40,330
You're going to make my nerves go down...

2231
01:50:41,130 --> 01:50:41,610
Oh, my gosh!

2232
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:41,610
You guys are so dumb...

2233
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:41,610
I love you!

2234
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:41,610
You're so dumb!

2235
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:41,610
You are so dumb!

2236
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:41,610
You're so dumb!

2237
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:41,610
Oh, my gosh, stop, you guys.

2238
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:41,610
You're going to make my nerves go down...

2239
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:45,550
I lived.

2240
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:48,110
Welcome back, everybody.

2241
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:49,570
You may have returned.

2242
01:50:51,950 --> 01:50:52,770
I'm on my phone.

2243
01:50:52,870 --> 01:50:53,550
What am I supposed to do?

2244
01:50:53,750 --> 01:50:53,910
Oh!

2245
01:50:56,330 --> 01:50:59,010
I don't know.

2246
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:02,870
Okay, there we go.

2247
01:51:03,290 --> 01:51:04,010
There we go.

2248
01:51:04,270 --> 01:51:04,670
Okay.

2249
01:51:05,130 --> 01:51:06,170
I think I got everything.

2250
01:51:06,350 --> 01:51:06,590
Alright.

2251
01:51:08,530 --> 01:51:09,230
Good, good, good.

2252
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:14,790
Now where is the door?

2253
01:51:16,550 --> 01:51:18,570
Oh, I went through here.

2254
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:20,010
Yes, yes, yes.

2255
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:23,370
And I think it was up here.

2256
01:51:24,710 --> 01:51:27,650
Why do I have two crafting tables next to each other?

2257
01:51:30,570 --> 01:51:33,450
Look, I was even starting to run out of torches.

2258
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,120
Hello, villagers.

2259
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:46,660
It is I.

2260
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:49,300
I've risen from...

2261
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:49,720
Eww!

2262
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:55,580
Get out of my bed!

2263
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:59,020
Okay, we have to un-employ somebody.

2264
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:09,990
Wow, we came just in time.

2265
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:10,550
It's a day.

2266
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:17,370
Let's just destroy all of their stuff.

2267
01:52:19,170 --> 01:52:20,230
Was there one in here?

2268
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:21,150
Yeah.

2269
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:26,230
Destroy, destroy, and then the cartography table was...

2270
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:27,030
You guys said it was cheap?

2271
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:35,340
This guy literally was just like, She ain't coming back.

2272
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:41,360
Four planks and two paper.

2273
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:41,980
Okay.

2274
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:48,080
Four planks, two paper.

2275
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:50,100
So we gotta go get some paper.

2276
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:56,600
Because I turned all of my sugar cane into...

2277
01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:58,600
Okay.

2278
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,980
This is how you do the paper, right?

2279
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:04,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2280
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:05,720
Um...

2281
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,980
Gonna eat this real quick.

2282
01:53:15,190 --> 01:53:15,630
Okay.

2283
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:26,880
AI Recaps says, Viewers are mass disconnecting from the stream as a form of protest against the streamer bit.

2284
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:27,320
Viewers are mass disconnecting from the stream as a form of protest against the streamer bit.

2285
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:29,120
She seems to dislike her audience.

2286
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:32,660
Why does the AI think I hate you guys so much?

2287
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:34,960
I think you've trained the AI to believe that.

2288
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:36,900
That's so untrue.

2289
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:38,620
What book app are you using?

2290
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:40,340
Um...

2291
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:43,560
The book app I'm using is just the Google Play Books app.

2292
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,300
And did I like Mated?

2293
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:51,400
I'll be honest, I only remember the beginning of the book because I then fell asleep.

2294
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:54,360
She hates us.

2295
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:56,520
She hates us.

2296
01:53:57,340 --> 01:53:59,080
Sorry, I gotta go find some...

2297
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:01,480
paper.

2298
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:04,380
Little Fox!

2299
01:54:08,990 --> 01:54:09,630
Dang.

2300
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:11,990
I was looking to see if there's any coal around here.

2301
01:54:14,730 --> 01:54:16,190
She hates us.

2302
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:20,030
Because you do hate us.

2303
01:54:20,130 --> 01:54:21,570
Three minutes late today.

2304
01:54:22,210 --> 01:54:22,850
Look.

2305
01:54:24,410 --> 01:54:27,010
Okay, I had to check on my cat.

2306
01:54:27,490 --> 01:54:27,790
Okay.

2307
01:54:30,450 --> 01:54:32,610
He was very stinky.

2308
01:54:32,910 --> 01:54:36,090
He was very stinky.

2309
01:54:36,250 --> 01:54:41,050
Every time I see my cat, I just want to give them lots of love.

2310
01:54:41,390 --> 01:54:45,910
Once I start going on them, I can't stop.

2311
01:54:46,410 --> 01:54:46,830
Okay.

2312
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:50,350
Can you blame me?

2313
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:52,410
Can you blame me?

2314
01:54:53,910 --> 01:54:57,050
The AI is jealous of the superior anime woman.

2315
01:54:57,410 --> 01:54:59,650
The AI is jealous of the superior anime woman.

2316
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:00,730
Who's to say I'm not AI?

2317
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:02,190
Who's to say I'm not AI?

2318
01:55:03,110 --> 01:55:04,050
I could be.

2319
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:07,770
Oh my gosh.

2320
01:55:07,890 --> 01:55:08,630
I wish there was...

2321
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:09,590
Where's all the...

2322
01:55:11,410 --> 01:55:12,770
Where's all the dang paper?

2323
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:13,810
Oh, there's one over there.

2324
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:17,410
I just went the wrong way.

2325
01:55:17,910 --> 01:55:18,390
Oh.

2326
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:22,450
I just went the wrong way.

2327
01:55:33,580 --> 01:55:34,060
GW?

2328
01:55:35,420 --> 01:55:36,740
I'm a Robo-phile.

2329
01:55:39,180 --> 01:55:40,160
So true.

2330
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:43,320
I know you're not AI, for I am AI.

2331
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:47,180
What if we're AI talking to each other?

2332
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:50,160
What kind of conversations do AIs have, I wonder?

2333
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:53,360
Hey, you get any interesting prompts lately?

2334
01:55:56,460 --> 01:56:07,020
This one guy asked for the prompt of the middle toe being larger than all of the other toes.

2335
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:07,980
Can you believe it?

2336
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:09,420
What a freak.

2337
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:12,100
Now the AI are judging us?

2338
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:15,160
We've gone too far.

2339
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:21,580
The AI are now judging us and saying that we have bad taste.

2340
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:30,590
Prompt.

2341
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:32,710
AI streamers start talking about Metal Gear Solid.

2342
01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:33,850
GW?

2343
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:36,950
Okay, so it's about these brothers.

2344
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:40,490
Oh, here's a bunch of them.

2345
01:56:40,590 --> 01:56:41,910
Good, good, good.

2346
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:44,490
Now we can go back.

2347
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:47,030
Wait!

2348
01:56:50,090 --> 01:56:51,290
Do you guys see that?

2349
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:59,460
This can only mean one thing.

2350
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:01,720
Lush biome.

2351
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,760
Do you think the trials would be lush?

2352
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:07,220
And plush.

2353
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:11,720
I'm not lost.

2354
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:21,120
Can't spell maid without AI.

2355
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:29,030
There's another tree over here too.

2356
01:57:30,230 --> 01:57:31,550
Flush biome.

2357
01:57:32,210 --> 01:57:33,230
This one here.

2358
01:57:33,730 --> 01:57:35,910
Definitely, definitely lush.

2359
01:57:40,210 --> 01:57:41,790
Alright, cartographer time.

2360
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:49,000
The heart of Metal Gear Solid is about family.

2361
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:56,950
Best series about family.

2362
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:03,530
Wait, am I going the right way?

2363
01:58:07,390 --> 01:58:08,290
Am I going the right way?

2364
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:13,360
Ore imo.

2365
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:19,460
It was right through here, right?

2366
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:20,780
And then the... what's it called?

2367
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:21,300
The...

2368
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:25,780
The pillagers are right here.

2369
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:26,520
On the right.

2370
01:58:36,430 --> 01:58:38,290
The reflections are kind of crazy.

2371
01:58:38,670 --> 01:58:40,330
They're really strong, aren't they?

2372
01:58:41,610 --> 01:58:43,150
Makes me think they're too cool.

2373
01:58:45,370 --> 01:58:46,690
Kuroneko best girl.

2374
01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:47,450
For real.

2375
01:58:49,950 --> 01:58:50,510
Kuroneko...

2376
01:58:50,510 --> 01:58:52,110
First of all...

2377
01:58:52,110 --> 01:58:53,310
What was his name?

2378
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:53,810
Kyousuke?

2379
01:58:56,270 --> 01:58:57,910
What did you think of the Minecraft movie trailer?

2380
01:58:59,670 --> 01:59:00,230
Oh...

2381
01:59:03,550 --> 01:59:04,110
Oh...

2382
01:59:05,290 --> 01:59:06,610
It was a trailer.

2383
01:59:12,310 --> 01:59:12,950
It was a trailer.

2384
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:14,210
Kuroneko is so good.

2385
01:59:16,170 --> 01:59:17,850
I'm glad she didn't get with him.

2386
01:59:24,150 --> 01:59:25,350
It was a trailer.

2387
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:26,930
It was a trailer.

2388
01:59:28,710 --> 01:59:30,890
There's so many people that are just like...

2389
01:59:30,890 --> 01:59:32,550
It's not for you.

2390
01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:34,850
It's for my six-year-old.

2391
01:59:35,070 --> 01:59:36,410
And you know what I have to say about that?

2392
01:59:36,970 --> 01:59:45,710
There are so many people at this point that have grown up with Minecraft.

2393
01:59:47,170 --> 01:59:50,550
There are so many people now that are adults that loved Minecraft.

2394
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:55,810
There are so... like basically every Minecraft creator is also an adult.

2395
01:59:55,950 --> 01:59:56,210
You know?

2396
01:59:58,210 --> 02:00:03,790
So to say that this is a movie that's only because it's Minecraft it's only supposed to be for kids.

2397
02:00:03,970 --> 02:00:09,650
I'd say Minecraft was the most popular back then.

2398
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:11,390
And now all those people are adults.

2399
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:23,240
So it just doesn't feel very, you know, to make it and then be like, oh but this isn't for you?

2400
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:25,200
What do you mean it's not for me?

2401
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:28,700
I grew up with Minecraft.

2402
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:29,920
I mean I didn't.

2403
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:33,080
Because I only started playing it like two years ago.

2404
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:36,440
But I feel like I grew up with it.

2405
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:38,940
Alright, where's our guys?

2406
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:40,660
Any enemies?

2407
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:41,900
Unemployed fellas over here?

2408
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:42,340
Oh.

2409
02:00:46,510 --> 02:00:47,970
Oh wait, I have to make the paper.

2410
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:52,190
And the cartography.

2411
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:52,550
Okay.

2412
02:00:52,670 --> 02:00:53,370
Uh, paper.

2413
02:00:55,550 --> 02:00:56,530
Oh we got a lot.

2414
02:00:56,710 --> 02:00:56,950
Okay.

2415
02:00:57,170 --> 02:00:57,650
Nice.

2416
02:00:57,790 --> 02:00:59,550
And then uh...

2417
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:01,570
Cartography table.

2418
02:01:02,610 --> 02:01:03,090
Perfect.

2419
02:01:06,130 --> 02:01:06,610
Okay.

2420
02:01:08,210 --> 02:01:10,090
Two hours and still stone tools?

2421
02:01:10,430 --> 02:01:10,910
Shush!

2422
02:01:11,490 --> 02:01:11,970
Shush!

2423
02:01:12,890 --> 02:01:13,470
Are you in here?

2424
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:14,250
Oh!

2425
02:01:14,670 --> 02:01:15,870
How'd you both get in there?

2426
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:19,270
Become a cartographer!

2427
02:01:19,530 --> 02:01:20,490
No, no, no, no, no!

2428
02:01:20,590 --> 02:01:21,650
Become a cartographer.

2429
02:01:33,410 --> 02:01:34,930
No, no, no, no, no!

2430
02:01:41,130 --> 02:01:42,650
Very cartoons are for kids core.

2431
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:43,030
I know!

2432
02:01:44,350 --> 02:01:45,370
Remove the cauldrons.

2433
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:50,250
What?

2434
02:01:50,730 --> 02:01:51,450
How did that work?

2435
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:52,650
Oh my god, sir.

2436
02:01:53,310 --> 02:01:53,350
Hello!

2437
02:01:55,670 --> 02:01:57,350
You've been playing Minecraft since you were 19.

2438
02:01:57,750 --> 02:01:58,270
So true!

2439
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:05,550
Minecraft surpassed Tetris as the most sold game of all time, and Tetris came with the Gameboy, which is the third most sold handheld of all time.

2440
02:02:05,810 --> 02:02:07,030
That's insane, actually.

2441
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:14,720
Leatherworker.

2442
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:16,920
Okay, so now I just buy the map.

2443
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:17,200
Oh.

2444
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:18,900
Oh.

2445
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:20,240
Oh.

2446
02:02:25,750 --> 02:02:26,830
I have no money.

2447
02:02:28,570 --> 02:02:30,070
I threw away my...

2448
02:02:30,710 --> 02:02:32,990
I threw away my money into the sea!

2449
02:02:33,170 --> 02:02:34,830
I said, I said,

2450
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:41,830
I said, I said, Okay, time to grind paper.

2451
02:02:52,770 --> 02:02:53,250
Okay.

2452
02:02:55,110 --> 02:02:56,310
Where'd I put my...

2453
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:56,890
Oh, the boat's over here.

2454
02:02:56,970 --> 02:02:57,110
Okay.

2455
02:02:58,150 --> 02:03:00,990
You've been playing Minecraft for over 10 years now.

2456
02:03:02,130 --> 02:03:03,210
Has it been that long?

2457
02:03:04,710 --> 02:03:07,050
When you're dead, you kinda lose track of the time, you know?

2458
02:03:12,630 --> 02:03:12,990
Okay.

2459
02:03:12,990 --> 02:03:13,990
Time to grind paper.

2460
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:15,670
I could make a...

2461
02:03:16,390 --> 02:03:20,470
I feel like if I make a paper machine, it will be...

2462
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:22,650
too...

2463
02:03:23,610 --> 02:03:23,970
annoying.

2464
02:03:24,330 --> 02:03:26,010
Also, I don't understand.

2465
02:03:26,150 --> 02:03:27,210
How is the map gonna help me?

2466
02:03:28,450 --> 02:03:31,130
I'm doing all this and I'm like, Do I really need a map?

2467
02:03:31,830 --> 02:03:32,930
How's the map gonna help me?

2468
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:33,910
I don't even know.

2469
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:35,830
Do I actually need a map?

2470
02:03:44,190 --> 02:03:45,150
Let's try this way.

2471
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:45,430
Let's try this way.

2472
02:03:45,430 --> 02:03:45,670
Let's try this way.

2473
02:03:45,750 --> 02:03:47,370
Do you think they have any paper?

2474
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:53,000
Okay.

2475
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:57,400
So, first we get paper to sell, and then...

2476
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:01,200
paper to sell, and then...

2477
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:01,780
paper to sell, and then...

2478
02:04:01,780 --> 02:04:02,840
make money and buy maps.

2479
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:03,440
make money and buy maps.

2480
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:05,540
Papers, please.

2481
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:08,180
Oh my gosh, that game is so awesome.

2482
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,760
I love Papers, Please.

2483
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:13,860
I would play that...

2484
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:15,360
all the time.

2485
02:04:16,140 --> 02:04:17,440
What is that structure?

2486
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:19,520
Oh, I think it's a tree.

2487
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:21,360
Oh yeah, it's a tree.

2488
02:04:27,140 --> 02:04:27,660
Anymore?

2489
02:04:33,690 --> 02:04:34,210
Anymore?

2490
02:04:35,850 --> 02:04:37,850
Okay, we gotta go over there a little bit.

2491
02:04:40,270 --> 02:04:42,210
Glory to Arstotzka.

2492
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:46,070
Glory to Arstotzka.

2493
02:04:46,070 --> 02:04:46,610
The game is like...

2494
02:04:48,850 --> 02:04:50,270
I did play the...

2495
02:04:50,270 --> 02:04:50,650
what's it called?

2496
02:04:51,990 --> 02:04:52,430
The...

2497
02:04:52,430 --> 02:04:53,170
Oh, see?

2498
02:04:53,310 --> 02:04:54,110
These are what I needed.

2499
02:04:54,170 --> 02:04:54,990
The magma blocks.

2500
02:04:55,150 --> 02:04:56,110
The magma cubes.

2501
02:04:57,510 --> 02:04:59,430
This is what I needed for under the water.

2502
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:02,930
Not worth.

2503
02:05:03,330 --> 02:05:04,430
Maybe I'll take one now.

2504
02:05:05,630 --> 02:05:06,070
Actually...

2505
02:05:07,050 --> 02:05:08,130
Nah, I have my door.

2506
02:05:08,390 --> 02:05:08,870
It's okay.

2507
02:05:10,590 --> 02:05:13,530
I won't scatter your money to the heartless sea.

2508
02:05:21,730 --> 02:05:22,930
I see some here.

2509
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:25,870
If you guys see...

2510
02:05:25,870 --> 02:05:26,930
If you guys see any...

2511
02:05:28,110 --> 02:05:28,590
Uh...

2512
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:29,310
What the?

2513
02:05:29,710 --> 02:05:31,230
I'm in the ground.

2514
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:33,210
How is that possible?

2515
02:05:33,650 --> 02:05:36,590
If you guys see any sugar cane, holla.

2516
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:37,210
Okay?

2517
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:37,710
Just go.

2518
02:05:38,690 --> 02:05:41,510
Just go yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel.

2519
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:44,130
Yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel.

2520
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:44,450
Yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel.

2521
02:05:45,550 --> 02:05:47,390
I won't see you become poor.

2522
02:05:47,570 --> 02:05:48,810
You're all free-checking.

2523
02:05:49,770 --> 02:05:50,970
Yodel, yodel, yodel.

2524
02:05:51,970 --> 02:05:53,130
Yodel, yodel, yodel.

2525
02:05:54,930 --> 02:05:56,150
Oh good, there's a bunch here.

2526
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,300
We won't get lost, everybody.

2527
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:02,440
Don't worry.

2528
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:07,140
I have a great direction sense.

2529
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:10,020
Yodel, yodel.

2530
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:11,640
No, I don't see any.

2531
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:16,340
Don't just go yodeling for no reason.

2532
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:18,480
It's bad behavior.

2533
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:20,460
I'm off to work.

2534
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:21,600
Bye Nexi.

2535
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:22,820
Have a good day at work.

2536
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:24,760
Have a good day at work.

2537
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:29,960
I want to learn how to yodel.

2538
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,020
Yodel, yodel, yodel.

2539
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,560
Yodel, yodel, yodel.

2540
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:38,680
Yodel lady, yodel lady.

2541
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:40,260
Yodel lady, yodel lady.

2542
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:43,600
Yodel lady, yodel lady.

2543
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:44,600
Bring back yodeling.

2544
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:47,300
Yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel.

2545
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:48,240
Wait a second.

2546
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:51,780
Who are you?

2547
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:52,460
No, I'm just kidding.

2548
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:53,760
We were here before.

2549
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:55,440
I should have grabbed it while I was here.

2550
02:06:57,580 --> 02:06:58,740
Oh, big yodels.

2551
02:06:58,840 --> 02:06:59,560
Big yodel.

2552
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:04,440
Yodeling is, I feel, such a lost art.

2553
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:06,620
It's such a good, interesting way of singing.

2554
02:07:13,530 --> 02:07:14,730
It's such a good, interesting way of singing.

2555
02:07:14,910 --> 02:07:16,450
It's such a good, interesting way of singing.

2556
02:07:16,850 --> 02:07:17,830
What's it called, kid?

2557
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:20,930
The kid that's just like, Wait a minute.

2558
02:07:21,690 --> 02:07:23,250
Who are you?

2559
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:28,880
So funny.

2560
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:32,260
Like to have fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

2561
02:07:32,740 --> 02:07:33,800
The kazoo kid.

2562
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:34,180
Yeah.

2563
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:40,420
I see, I see coal in there.

2564
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:42,760
Oh, we got a good amount of coal, maybe.

2565
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:45,720
We can also see...

2566
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:47,760
What's in there?

2567
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:49,220
Oh.

2568
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:52,060
I can grab this coal.

2569
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:55,940
I thought that was a skeleton.

2570
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:56,520
Oh my god.

2571
02:07:56,720 --> 02:07:57,480
Oh my gosh.

2572
02:08:01,140 --> 02:08:01,880
What's happening?

2573
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:04,160
Oh.

2574
02:08:04,780 --> 02:08:06,120
Gosh, this scared me.

2575
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:10,900
Scared me bad.

2576
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:12,740
Is there anything in here?

2577
02:08:16,950 --> 02:08:18,390
Oh, there's lots of coal.

2578
02:08:19,370 --> 02:08:19,850
Ah!

2579
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:21,190
Ah!

2580
02:08:24,250 --> 02:08:25,830
But there's so much coal.

2581
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:29,790
The coal was a trap.

2582
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:31,250
Ah.

2583
02:08:32,890 --> 02:08:33,810
How much paper?

2584
02:08:33,970 --> 02:08:35,190
We have 42 sugarcane.

2585
02:08:35,450 --> 02:08:37,130
Sorry, my head is blocking a little bit.

2586
02:08:37,390 --> 02:08:38,990
We have 42 sugarcane.

2587
02:08:39,130 --> 02:08:39,710
You think that's enough?

2588
02:08:40,510 --> 02:08:42,090
How many maps do you think we need?

2589
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:51,390
Yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel.

2590
02:08:52,410 --> 02:08:55,070
Yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel.

2591
02:08:55,390 --> 02:08:55,630
Yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel.

2592
02:08:55,630 --> 02:08:55,850
Yodel, yodel yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel.

2593
02:08:57,010 --> 02:08:58,950
Okay, we'll have to... that's going to be a sneaky one.

2594
02:09:05,450 --> 02:09:07,790
Oh, I think the lush biome extends all the way to here.

2595
02:09:08,390 --> 02:09:09,530
Or is this where we came from?

2596
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:10,950
Gosh, I can't remember.

2597
02:09:11,530 --> 02:09:13,070
The whole area looks the same.

2598
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:16,590
Didn't I just see some water or am I crazy?

2599
02:09:18,970 --> 02:09:20,350
Yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel.

2600
02:09:21,710 --> 02:09:23,010
Yodel, yodel, yodel, yodel.

2601
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:24,250
We're

2602
02:09:31,660 --> 02:09:32,340
not lost!

2603
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:33,140
We're not lost!

2604
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:34,720
Yeah, see?

2605
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:36,200
This is where the lush area is.

2606
02:09:36,340 --> 02:09:36,480
See?

2607
02:09:37,340 --> 02:09:38,360
I know, I know.

2608
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:39,840
Yeah, I know I missed some.

2609
02:09:39,900 --> 02:09:40,240
Don't worry.

2610
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:42,040
It's okay.

2611
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:44,100
I might head back soon.

2612
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:45,800
Because we're at 48.

2613
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:49,400
53.

2614
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:51,460
Oh!

2615
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:55,120
Pulling out on me, huh?

2616
02:09:56,740 --> 02:09:57,920
Trying to sneak away?

2617
02:09:58,160 --> 02:09:59,320
Trying to sneak back?

2618
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:01,860
That's a lot of paper per emerald, wasn't it?

2619
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:02,720
But wasn't it...

2620
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:04,780
You get three pieces of paper.

2621
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:08,640
Per something.

2622
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:09,800
I don't remember how much.

2623
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:14,680
Oh, my sand block.

2624
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:15,080
You're right.

2625
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:20,120
Here, we can actually just check right now.

2626
02:10:20,260 --> 02:10:22,160
We can just check right now.

2627
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:25,540
Paper.

2628
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:36,240
It's not bad.

2629
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:39,520
Seven emeralds for one map.

2630
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:40,500
Oh my god.

2631
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:40,780
Seven?

2632
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:42,580
For one map?

2633
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:43,800
You guys, how many maps?

2634
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:45,040
Can I overwrite a map?

2635
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:46,160
How many maps do you think I need?

2636
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:48,580
If I just need one, we'll be fine.

2637
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:49,760
Right?

2638
02:10:59,260 --> 02:11:01,080
Why can't I use a regular paper?

2639
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:02,940
To make a map.

2640
02:11:03,180 --> 02:11:04,040
It makes no sense.

2641
02:11:09,410 --> 02:11:10,590
Don't buy a blank map.

2642
02:11:11,730 --> 02:11:12,230
Oh, really?

2643
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:18,100
You have to level up the villager too.

2644
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:19,100
Oh my gosh.

2645
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:19,180
Oh my gosh.

2646
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:24,200
Okay, this one is really...

2647
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:25,520
This is a top secret mission.

2648
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:27,500
Okay, I think we're good.

2649
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:29,400
I don't see anymore over there.

2650
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:31,120
I see him though.

2651
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:35,000
Wait, I do see some!

2652
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:35,860
Oh no.

2653
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:37,460
Is it worth it?

2654
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:40,240
Is it worth it?

2655
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:43,720
I could be in and out.

2656
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:47,200
There's two of them?

2657
02:11:50,020 --> 02:11:50,840
There's two of them?

2658
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:51,000
They're all swimming.

2659
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:52,340
Why are they coming to me?

2660
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:54,320
Wait, why is he...

2661
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:58,500
All I have to do is be in and out.

2662
02:12:10,310 --> 02:12:11,690
I don't want them to shoot me.

2663
02:12:20,660 --> 02:12:21,080
Yeah!

2664
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:24,600
Yeah!

2665
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:26,280
Let's go!

2666
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:33,740
Yeah!

2667
02:12:39,240 --> 02:12:39,840
Yeah!

2668
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:46,960
Give us the whole 13 pieces!

2669
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:52,300
Alright.

2670
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:55,460
Yodel if you see anymore on the way back.

2671
02:12:58,500 --> 02:12:59,600
I missed one!

2672
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:00,400
Oh no.

2673
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:01,480
You know what?

2674
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:01,820
It's fine.

2675
02:13:03,180 --> 02:13:04,540
Is that even the BGM?

2676
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:05,400
Oh...

2677
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:09,720
I grabbed it from Dova Syndrome like right before stream.

2678
02:13:11,220 --> 02:13:11,780
Um...

2679
02:13:12,540 --> 02:13:13,180
I can check.

2680
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:15,740
Give me a second.

2681
02:13:20,820 --> 02:13:22,180
Give me a second.

2682
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:23,260
Give me a second.

2683
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,340
It's this way, right?

2684
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:25,640
Yeah.

2685
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:27,720
This way.

2686
02:13:30,100 --> 02:13:30,960
This way.

2687
02:13:31,780 --> 02:13:32,740
Ha ha ha.

2688
02:13:37,690 --> 02:13:38,250
Hmm...

2689
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:39,510
I don't see anymore.

2690
02:13:40,250 --> 02:13:41,190
It's too close to home.

2691
02:13:41,230 --> 02:13:42,330
I would've gotten all of it.

2692
02:13:47,790 --> 02:13:48,410
Okie dokie.

2693
02:13:49,330 --> 02:13:51,070
There better not be anybody in my bed.

2694
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:01,120
Actually...

2695
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:02,760
Oh wait, there's sticks here.

2696
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:06,060
Oh, I can't pick them up.

2697
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:06,480
I'm full.

2698
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:09,440
Um...

2699
02:14:09,940 --> 02:14:10,380
Paper.

2700
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:15,190
It's fine.

2701
02:14:15,390 --> 02:14:16,250
We gotta call them.

2702
02:14:19,850 --> 02:14:20,250
Ok.

2703
02:14:20,830 --> 02:14:22,330
Oh, but we have to have them wake up.

2704
02:14:22,410 --> 02:14:22,670
Don't we?

2705
02:14:23,110 --> 02:14:23,510
Ok.

2706
02:14:23,610 --> 02:14:24,330
Get up everybody.

2707
02:14:25,110 --> 02:14:25,510
Daytime.

2708
02:14:28,630 --> 02:14:29,030
Daytime.

2709
02:14:29,070 --> 02:14:29,370
Daytime.

2710
02:14:29,470 --> 02:14:29,710
Daytime.

2711
02:14:32,330 --> 02:14:32,730
Ok.

2712
02:14:32,850 --> 02:14:33,210
Wake up.

2713
02:14:33,970 --> 02:14:34,370
Oh.

2714
02:14:37,860 --> 02:14:38,940
That almost hit you.

2715
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:40,520
Oh no.

2716
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:41,200
Oh no.

2717
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:41,820
Wait.

2718
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:44,800
No

2719
02:14:56,060 --> 02:14:56,460
worries.

2720
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:02,160
We can handle him.

2721
02:15:03,200 --> 02:15:04,180
Hey you.

2722
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:06,080
Hey you.

2723
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,300
Hey you.

2724
02:15:09,660 --> 02:15:10,340
Yeah.

2725
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:11,940
Yeah.

2726
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:16,300
Ha ha ha.

2727
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:19,140
Ha ha ha.

2728
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:20,400
Ha ha ha.

2729
02:15:21,220 --> 02:15:21,900
Woah.

2730
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:24,620
Yeah.

2731
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:25,260
You're right.

2732
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:26,000
I saved your life.

2733
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:26,460
You're welcome.

2734
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,240
You're so welcome.

2735
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:34,700
Now, our cartographer friend was in here I believe.

2736
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:38,300
Or...

2737
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:40,480
So he says.

2738
02:15:41,140 --> 02:15:41,820
Hello?

2739
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:43,440
Cartographer.

2740
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:44,320
Hello.

2741
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:45,180
Good morning.

2742
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:47,440
I offer you...

2743
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:50,540
I offer you...

2744
02:15:50,540 --> 02:15:51,120
Oh my gosh.

2745
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:53,140
I'm out of paper already.

2746
02:16:08,290 --> 02:16:10,390
We live in a society.

2747
02:16:10,710 --> 02:16:12,390
This is inflation real.

2748
02:16:15,190 --> 02:16:16,850
I'm gonna plant this one.

2749
02:16:18,150 --> 02:16:19,990
Maybe it will grow like right here.

2750
02:16:20,130 --> 02:16:20,370
You know?

2751
02:16:25,190 --> 02:16:25,650
Unlimited.

2752
02:16:26,710 --> 02:16:27,810
Sugar cane works.

2753
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:42,220
My trap.

2754
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:45,220
I fell into my own trap.

2755
02:16:50,310 --> 02:16:50,930
Bone meal?

2756
02:16:51,050 --> 02:16:52,130
I don't think bone meal works.

2757
02:16:52,830 --> 02:16:53,290
On...

2758
02:16:54,850 --> 02:16:55,690
Sugar cane.

2759
02:16:56,630 --> 02:16:57,150
Okay.

2760
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:58,710
What else can we do?

2761
02:17:00,290 --> 02:17:01,730
The only way we can...

2762
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:06,870
Maybe I should just buy the empty maps and all.

2763
02:17:07,990 --> 02:17:09,150
To level him up.

2764
02:17:11,910 --> 02:17:12,690
Oh no.

2765
02:17:12,750 --> 02:17:13,950
I need seven emeralds.

2766
02:17:14,210 --> 02:17:14,730
Okay.

2767
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:17,130
Maybe we can sell something to this guy.

2768
02:17:17,490 --> 02:17:19,510
What are you trying to buy?

2769
02:17:20,690 --> 02:17:21,210
Bread!

2770
02:17:21,270 --> 02:17:22,990
We can buy... Wait.

2771
02:17:23,790 --> 02:17:24,190
No.

2772
02:17:24,190 --> 02:17:24,970
That's not what I need.

2773
02:17:25,110 --> 02:17:25,370
No.

2774
02:17:26,130 --> 02:17:26,530
Potatoes!

2775
02:17:26,670 --> 02:17:27,690
I only have four.

2776
02:17:28,810 --> 02:17:29,210
Okay.

2777
02:17:30,130 --> 02:17:31,970
Guys, we're in a bit of a pickle right now.

2778
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:42,400
We're in a bit of a pickle.

2779
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:44,980
What about you?

2780
02:17:46,140 --> 02:17:46,540
Coal!

2781
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:47,280
Two gems!

2782
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:49,380
But I need the coal.

2783
02:17:54,830 --> 02:17:56,030
I could always just get more.

2784
02:17:59,310 --> 02:18:00,010
What about you?

2785
02:18:00,010 --> 02:18:00,090
What about you?

2786
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:03,570
Wheat.

2787
02:18:13,670 --> 02:18:15,030
You have plenty of coal.

2788
02:18:17,110 --> 02:18:18,530
I guess I don't need it that bad.

2789
02:18:18,710 --> 02:18:19,830
I guess I can have...

2790
02:18:19,830 --> 02:18:20,990
I can get rid of some of it.

2791
02:18:25,570 --> 02:18:25,890
Seven!

2792
02:18:29,990 --> 02:18:30,310
Sir!

2793
02:18:31,130 --> 02:18:32,290
Don't shut the door on me!

2794
02:18:32,350 --> 02:18:33,450
I'm trying to do business with you!

2795
02:18:33,450 --> 02:18:35,310
Oh, it doesn't even level him up that much.

2796
02:18:36,130 --> 02:18:36,610
No!

2797
02:18:37,870 --> 02:18:38,890
Oh my god.

2798
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:48,100
What do I do?

2799
02:18:57,470 --> 02:18:59,210
Did I sell all my coal?

2800
02:19:00,190 --> 02:19:00,930
No way.

2801
02:19:01,050 --> 02:19:02,030
I sold all of it?

2802
02:19:08,230 --> 02:19:09,070
Where's the rest?

2803
02:19:09,630 --> 02:19:10,110
Oops.

2804
02:19:10,270 --> 02:19:11,090
I didn't even notice.

2805
02:19:15,870 --> 02:19:16,670
Oh man.

2806
02:19:17,690 --> 02:19:18,490
No way!

2807
02:19:20,830 --> 02:19:22,210
Maybe we just go back in.

2808
02:19:25,430 --> 02:19:27,010
Maybe I just go find it.

2809
02:19:29,670 --> 02:19:31,330
Yeah, the cave that has all the coal.

2810
02:19:31,490 --> 02:19:32,630
Let's go back and do that.

2811
02:19:33,490 --> 02:19:35,390
Because I do need... wait, where's my boat?

2812
02:19:35,450 --> 02:19:35,670
Here it is.

2813
02:19:36,390 --> 02:19:38,270
I do need at least a little bit of coal.

2814
02:19:39,370 --> 02:19:40,150
What a waste.

2815
02:19:40,150 --> 02:19:41,850
You guys...

2816
02:19:41,850 --> 02:19:43,210
This is such a flop.

2817
02:19:43,570 --> 02:19:46,990
My whole plan is just... everything is backfiring against me!

2818
02:19:48,970 --> 02:19:50,030
What's happening?

2819
02:19:51,110 --> 02:19:52,370
Why can't I...

2820
02:19:52,370 --> 02:19:53,570
I keep getting scammed.

2821
02:19:54,550 --> 02:19:55,990
What else is new?

2822
02:20:01,950 --> 02:20:02,730
It hurts.

2823
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:04,750
It hurts.

2824
02:20:27,970 --> 02:20:28,650
Freedom!

2825
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:42,600
Freedom!

2826
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:43,380
Freedom!

2827
02:20:46,220 --> 02:20:46,860
Okay.

2828
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:54,640
Let's go get that coal.

2829
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:56,220
From that cave.

2830
02:21:07,940 --> 02:21:09,580
Pinto got the server working.

2831
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:15,180
Yeah, you see all these people around me?

2832
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:18,880
We're having the time of our afterlives.

2833
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:19,400
Aren't we?

2834
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:22,500
Yodel.

2835
02:21:27,870 --> 02:21:28,690
Yodel, yodel.

2836
02:21:35,700 --> 02:21:37,020
They don't know.

2837
02:21:40,700 --> 02:21:41,400
It's okay.

2838
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:44,020
I'm playing with everybody right now.

2839
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:44,900
It's so much fun.

2840
02:21:46,420 --> 02:21:49,000
I'm having so much fun right now.

2841
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:50,340
Playing with everybody.

2842
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:53,580
Everybody is being so respectful.

2843
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:55,140
Nobody is trying to kill me.

2844
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:56,480
It's great.

2845
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:59,160
Oh, somebody even...

2846
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:01,380
Somebody even gifted me diamonds.

2847
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:07,180
It's so awesome.

2848
02:22:11,160 --> 02:22:11,760
Wow,

2849
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,680
so cool.

2850
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:30,200
Oh my gosh, Murphy.

2851
02:22:30,380 --> 02:22:31,200
Thanks for the diamonds.

2852
02:22:38,950 --> 02:22:40,630
This feels like Bochy.

2853
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:44,610
Where was that cave actually?

2854
02:22:45,870 --> 02:22:47,050
Am I going the right way?

2855
02:22:47,630 --> 02:22:49,050
This area is not that big.

2856
02:22:50,130 --> 02:22:51,990
When she forgets to take her meds.

2857
02:22:53,470 --> 02:22:54,290
Oh, here's some.

2858
02:22:55,510 --> 02:22:56,670
This is a different place.

2859
02:22:56,710 --> 02:22:57,350
But here's some.

2860
02:23:02,860 --> 02:23:03,460
Yeah.

2861
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:06,480
Yeah.

2862
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:07,320
Yeah.

2863
02:23:08,360 --> 02:23:08,960
Yeah.

2864
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:10,320
Yeah.

2865
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:13,200
Oh yeah.

2866
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:15,880
Oh yeah, that's the good itch.

2867
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:18,380
Oh yeah, yeah, that's the good itch.

2868
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:19,900
Oh yeah, yeah.

2869
02:23:25,230 --> 02:23:25,830
MMO.

2870
02:23:26,130 --> 02:23:27,270
Made bit online.

2871
02:23:29,490 --> 02:23:30,630
Critically acclaimed.

2872
02:23:30,630 --> 02:23:30,690
Critically acclaimed.

2873
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:35,460
Okay, how much was that?

2874
02:23:35,660 --> 02:23:36,140
24?

2875
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:39,820
You know what's funnier than 24?

2876
02:23:43,340 --> 02:23:44,380
You know what's funnier than 24?

2877
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:47,960
Oh, dang it.

2878
02:23:48,020 --> 02:23:49,100
Oh, dang it.

2879
02:23:51,460 --> 02:23:53,060
Oh, it's really deep down here.

2880
02:24:12,790 --> 02:24:13,830
Oh, it's really deep down here.

2881
02:24:13,830 --> 02:24:14,030
Nice.

2882
02:24:17,830 --> 02:24:19,510
I don't see anymore in there.

2883
02:24:20,510 --> 02:24:20,910
I don't see anymore in there.

2884
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:21,030
I don't see anymore in there.

2885
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:26,820
I had a dream that Disney built a Vtuber theme park.

2886
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:27,040
I had a dream that Disney built a Vtuber theme park.

2887
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:28,700
But you were the only characters...

2888
02:24:28,700 --> 02:24:30,580
character rights they could get.

2889
02:24:30,740 --> 02:24:37,220
And everyone was like, They'd be like, Who is that?

2890
02:24:41,780 --> 02:24:43,980
That would be so sad.

2891
02:24:44,420 --> 02:24:44,840
That would be so sad.

2892
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:47,600
That would be so sad.

2893
02:24:47,780 --> 02:24:49,740
I'd be like, Vtuber who?

2894
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:53,720
I'd be like, Vtuber who?

2895
02:24:55,580 --> 02:24:56,900
Oh my gosh.

2896
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:59,320
What kind of rides would I have?

2897
02:24:59,820 --> 02:24:59,840
What kind of rides would I have?

2898
02:25:00,480 --> 02:25:01,920
Well, I mean, the cafe.

2899
02:25:02,140 --> 02:25:04,740
There would obviously be a cafe themed after me.

2900
02:25:05,380 --> 02:25:06,580
Am I going the right way?

2901
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:07,040
Am I going the right way?

2902
02:25:09,760 --> 02:25:11,480
Because there would have to be a maid cafe.

2903
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:17,320
Tea cups?

2904
02:25:18,820 --> 02:25:19,920
A haunted house!

2905
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:20,640
Of course!

2906
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:22,920
Of course, of course!

2907
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:24,680
Oh my gosh.

2908
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:26,320
I would love to have a haunted house.

2909
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:30,480
There's been like...

2910
02:25:31,580 --> 02:25:32,280
What's it called?

2911
02:25:35,780 --> 02:25:36,640
Is this...

2912
02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:40,160
This isn't the one I went to before.

2913
02:25:40,320 --> 02:25:40,600
Is it?

2914
02:25:42,440 --> 02:25:43,080
Is it?

2915
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:46,340
Oh, it is!

2916
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:54,560
There have been like...

2917
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:56,180
escape rooms that have been...

2918
02:25:56,180 --> 02:25:58,380
voiced by Vtubers and stuff.

2919
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,860
Or rather, collabs with Vtubers.

2920
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:01,140
You know?

2921
02:26:02,940 --> 02:26:04,260
These guys won't catch up to me.

2922
02:26:04,340 --> 02:26:04,800
What are you guys saying?

2923
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:06,840
I checked out a Vtuber meetup just cause.

2924
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:09,360
They said, so good to meet a fan.

2925
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:10,880
And I stumbled not to say...

2926
02:26:12,220 --> 02:26:13,540
I don't know who you are.

2927
02:26:13,640 --> 02:26:14,320
I was just saying...

2928
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:18,320
I've had meet and greets before.

2929
02:26:18,540 --> 02:26:20,320
Where people will come and say...

2930
02:26:20,320 --> 02:26:21,420
I don't know who you are.

2931
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:24,560
They would be like...

2932
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:25,460
I don't know who you are.

2933
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:25,920
Sorry.

2934
02:26:26,020 --> 02:26:26,600
I just...

2935
02:26:33,640 --> 02:26:35,560
I just found you.

2936
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,200
Like I just got your...

2937
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:38,340
I just wanted a meet and greet.

2938
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:46,580
Oh look!

2939
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:49,300
We're back!

2940
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:50,880
Let's go to this place.

2941
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:51,840
See?

2942
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:52,520
So easy.

2943
02:26:52,900 --> 02:26:53,760
I know where we are.

2944
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:55,440
Oh my gosh!

2945
02:26:57,420 --> 02:26:58,380
Do you want to come with?

2946
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:02,100
Come here, come here.

2947
02:27:02,160 --> 02:27:02,760
I'll give you a bread.

2948
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:04,760
Come here, come here.

2949
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:05,320
I'll give you a bread.

2950
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:12,800
No one noticed.

2951
02:27:13,780 --> 02:27:14,780
Our little guy...

2952
02:27:14,780 --> 02:27:15,620
Oh it's this way, isn't it?

2953
02:27:21,180 --> 02:27:22,240
Our ally is looking.

2954
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:23,820
Wait!

2955
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:26,460
Doesn't the ally bring stuff?

2956
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:29,220
Can't I just tell him to bring me more paper?

2957
02:27:30,980 --> 02:27:33,080
If I give him paper, won't he bring more paper?

2958
02:27:36,440 --> 02:27:38,000
Do you remember your first meet and greet?

2959
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:38,800
Of course I do.

2960
02:27:50,950 --> 02:27:51,370
Oh!

2961
02:27:51,530 --> 02:27:51,950
Oh!

2962
02:27:53,270 --> 02:27:53,690
Oh!

2963
02:27:55,250 --> 02:27:55,670
Wait!

2964
02:27:58,670 --> 02:27:59,550
That's my bed!

2965
02:28:00,510 --> 02:28:01,010
Oh my god!

2966
02:28:01,110 --> 02:28:01,770
He almost...

2967
02:28:01,770 --> 02:28:02,030
Wait!

2968
02:28:02,090 --> 02:28:04,250
He's trying to decide whether to go after that guy or me.

2969
02:28:06,870 --> 02:28:07,230
Idiot!

2970
02:28:07,230 --> 02:28:08,170
You don't know who to go after!

2971
02:28:09,290 --> 02:28:09,650
Idiot!

2972
02:28:13,060 --> 02:28:13,480
You don't know who to go after!

2973
02:28:16,360 --> 02:28:16,720
No!

2974
02:28:16,820 --> 02:28:17,400
Go after him!

2975
02:28:17,460 --> 02:28:18,620
He's literally laying there!

2976
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:19,260
Wait!

2977
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:21,200
The villager is going to die!

2978
02:28:22,220 --> 02:28:23,400
The villager is going to die!

2979
02:28:25,060 --> 02:28:25,740
I got you!

2980
02:28:25,820 --> 02:28:26,440
I'll protect you!

2981
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:27,580
I'll protect you!

2982
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:29,240
I'll protect you!

2983
02:28:29,240 --> 02:28:30,700
I'll protect you!

2984
02:28:31,020 --> 02:28:31,880
I'll protect you!

2985
02:28:32,320 --> 02:28:33,040
This guy's got a shovel!

2986
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:38,500
I protected you!

2987
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:39,520
Wait, I hear another guy.

2988
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:47,140
Fall into my hole!

2989
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:52,840
Okay.

2990
02:29:01,740 --> 02:29:03,800
Why is the spider enchanted?

2991
02:29:04,540 --> 02:29:05,320
You see that?

2992
02:29:05,320 --> 02:29:06,960
Yeah, he's got little things coming off of him.

2993
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:18,520
That was craziness.

2994
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:22,380
He's drunk?

2995
02:29:26,740 --> 02:29:28,480
Heart spiders are sometimes magical.

2996
02:29:28,860 --> 02:29:31,020
Oh my gosh, he just climbed up the house.

2997
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:35,940
What kind of effect does he have?

2998
02:29:36,140 --> 02:29:36,600
Oh my gosh.

2999
02:29:37,640 --> 02:29:39,120
There's so many of them.

3000
02:29:39,300 --> 02:29:40,560
It's a horde of spiders.

3001
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:43,820
Hello, sir.

3002
02:29:43,940 --> 02:29:45,260
I will give you more paper.

3003
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:47,820
In just a moment.

3004
02:29:48,140 --> 02:29:49,320
In a moment's time.

3005
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:52,760
In just a moment.

3006
02:29:52,760 --> 02:29:52,760
In a moment's time.

3007
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:53,400
Paper...

3008
02:29:53,960 --> 02:29:54,480
Paper...

3009
02:29:55,060 --> 02:29:55,580
Okay.

3010
02:30:02,540 --> 02:30:03,240
No, but...

3011
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:04,480
Everybody ignore the giant spiders.

3012
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:07,980
Everybody ignore the giant spiders, okay?

3013
02:30:10,320 --> 02:30:11,200
Everybody ignore the giant spiders, okay?

3014
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:12,680
I still don't have enough!

3015
02:30:21,060 --> 02:30:22,060
Reign of spiders!

3016
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:25,820
I wish I could tell what he was buffed with.

3017
02:30:32,390 --> 02:30:33,310
I wish I could tell what he was buffed with.

3018
02:30:33,310 --> 02:30:36,110
Did anyone tell Mint how expensive the Trial Chamber's map is?

3019
02:30:36,570 --> 02:30:36,910
Did anyone tell Mint how expensive the Trial Chamber's map is?

3020
02:30:36,910 --> 02:30:37,070
What the?

3021
02:30:37,270 --> 02:30:38,190
What did I do?

3022
02:30:38,730 --> 02:30:39,790
What did I do?

3023
02:30:40,410 --> 02:30:41,370
What did I do?

3024
02:30:44,770 --> 02:30:46,910
He came after me for nothing!

3025
02:30:47,410 --> 02:30:47,550
He came after me for nothing!

3026
02:30:47,550 --> 02:30:49,270
I didn't even do anything!

3027
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:58,660
Oh my gosh.

3028
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:00,640
Aggressive.

3029
02:31:01,320 --> 02:31:02,180
Deserves it.

3030
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:05,460
Can plant these too.

3031
02:31:07,960 --> 02:31:08,640
Grow!

3032
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:09,340
Grow!

3033
02:31:09,660 --> 02:31:09,920
Grow!

3034
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:12,440
Why isn't this one grown at all?

3035
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:13,600
Why isn't this one grown at all?

3036
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:14,440
Why isn't this one grown at all?

3037
02:31:16,900 --> 02:31:18,400
They aggro in low light.

3038
02:31:18,540 --> 02:31:19,660
I was under a tree!

3039
02:31:31,770 --> 02:31:33,130
I was under a tree.

3040
02:31:42,310 --> 02:31:43,970
You can use sugarcane to speed it up.

3041
02:31:44,710 --> 02:31:45,110
Wait.

3042
02:31:45,190 --> 02:31:46,670
Sugarcane to speed up the sugarcane?

3043
02:31:48,830 --> 02:31:49,230
No.

3044
02:32:05,580 --> 02:32:06,560
Let's just go back in.

3045
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:09,280
I think I'll stumble upon...

3046
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:10,940
it with my sheer...

3047
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:13,540
sheer luck and spontaneity.

3048
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:18,280
Let's put this stuff away.

3049
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:19,340
In here.

3050
02:32:21,020 --> 02:32:21,460
Like that.

3051
02:32:24,700 --> 02:32:26,640
I lost all my coal.

3052
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:27,920
But that's okay.

3053
02:32:29,540 --> 02:32:30,220
You know.

3054
02:32:32,180 --> 02:32:33,020
That's fine.

3055
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:33,440
Probably.

3056
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:36,720
We have a little bit of iron.

3057
02:32:36,980 --> 02:32:37,740
And everything.

3058
02:32:38,020 --> 02:32:39,200
Is this your own Minecraft?

3059
02:32:40,060 --> 02:32:40,540
Yeah.

3060
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:41,440
Yeah.

3061
02:32:43,180 --> 02:32:44,140
It's mine.

3062
02:32:45,360 --> 02:32:45,840
Oh.

3063
02:32:46,280 --> 02:32:47,500
I hope nothing's down.

3064
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:48,860
We're good.

3065
02:32:54,040 --> 02:32:54,520
Okay.

3066
02:32:56,720 --> 02:32:57,200
Oh.

3067
02:32:57,280 --> 02:32:58,620
I forgot one of these.

3068
02:32:58,740 --> 02:32:59,500
So I'm gonna take it back.

3069
02:33:02,060 --> 02:33:03,000
Things I've learned.

3070
02:33:03,360 --> 02:33:03,840
1.

3071
02:33:03,980 --> 02:33:08,100
The Shadow Moses act of MGS4 is the only part with a unique game over theme.

3072
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:11,020
That sounds similar to MGS1's and Peace Walker's game.

3073
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:11,680
2.

3074
02:33:12,580 --> 02:33:14,000
Senator Armstrong is the only.

3075
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:15,940
He's the only.

3076
02:33:18,360 --> 02:33:19,360
Oh my god.

3077
02:33:23,890 --> 02:33:24,410
Okay.

3078
02:33:24,430 --> 02:33:24,870
Here we go.

3079
02:33:26,450 --> 02:33:27,850
First of all, let's do this.

3080
02:33:28,230 --> 02:33:28,570
There we go.

3081
02:33:28,670 --> 02:33:28,910
Okay.

3082
02:33:29,730 --> 02:33:30,250
Oh.

3083
02:33:30,410 --> 02:33:30,710
Wait.

3084
02:33:30,790 --> 02:33:31,230
There's some more here.

3085
02:33:34,490 --> 02:33:35,850
Can the allies swim?

3086
02:33:37,470 --> 02:33:38,970
Are you gonna be okay?

3087
02:33:43,360 --> 02:33:44,160
The only.

3088
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:44,880
I know.

3089
02:33:44,920 --> 02:33:45,540
The cliffhanger.

3090
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:46,940
He's the only one.

3091
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:49,680
He's the only one for me.

3092
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:51,560
Okay.

3093
02:33:54,200 --> 02:33:55,900
We're gonna make a little...

3094
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:00,660
We're gonna make a little hole here.

3095
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:02,960
Okay.

3096
02:34:03,140 --> 02:34:07,960
Only man in Metal Gear Universe that can make people fear the sound of a whoop.

3097
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:12,300
No matter what game Min plays, she can never escape Metal Gear references.

3098
02:34:15,220 --> 02:34:15,940
So true.

3099
02:34:16,780 --> 02:34:17,180
Oh.

3100
02:34:17,240 --> 02:34:17,640
Oh.

3101
02:34:17,660 --> 02:34:18,400
This isn't...

3102
02:34:20,200 --> 02:34:20,600
Okay.

3103
02:34:21,180 --> 02:34:21,360
Okay.

3104
02:34:21,380 --> 02:34:21,500
Okay.

3105
02:34:23,060 --> 02:34:23,720
A whoop.

3106
02:34:27,740 --> 02:34:29,220
And then I can put a door here.

3107
02:34:29,420 --> 02:34:29,800
Hold on.

3108
02:34:30,920 --> 02:34:31,320
I'm...

3109
02:34:31,320 --> 02:34:33,060
I'm thinking with portals.

3110
02:34:33,140 --> 02:34:33,320
Oh.

3111
02:34:33,440 --> 02:34:34,320
If I can get inside.

3112
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:35,200
There we go.

3113
02:34:35,440 --> 02:34:36,600
I'm thinking with portals.

3114
02:34:36,620 --> 02:34:37,120
There we go.

3115
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:44,420
Yeah.

3116
02:34:44,980 --> 02:34:45,440
Yeah.

3117
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:46,700
Yeah.

3118
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:47,740
Yeah.

3119
02:34:47,740 --> 02:34:47,740
See?

3120
02:34:49,220 --> 02:34:49,680
No!

3121
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:50,140
No!

3122
02:34:54,440 --> 02:34:54,900
I...

3123
02:34:54,900 --> 02:34:56,160
I take this bread from you.

3124
02:34:56,180 --> 02:34:56,700
It's too dangerous.

3125
02:34:57,320 --> 02:34:58,100
Give it to me.

3126
02:34:58,200 --> 02:34:59,100
Give me the bread.

3127
02:34:59,260 --> 02:35:00,120
Give me the bread.

3128
02:35:00,280 --> 02:35:00,940
Give me the bread!

3129
02:35:01,320 --> 02:35:02,360
Where are you going?

3130
02:35:03,980 --> 02:35:04,440
Stop!

3131
02:35:05,420 --> 02:35:06,060
Thank you.

3132
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:12,540
Oh!

3133
02:35:16,430 --> 02:35:17,670
You scared me!

3134
02:35:17,830 --> 02:35:18,770
You scared me!

3135
02:35:18,770 --> 02:35:19,070
Let me free.

3136
02:35:20,790 --> 02:35:21,450
Free.

3137
02:35:22,230 --> 02:35:24,130
It's a reverse Dobby.

3138
02:35:24,810 --> 02:35:26,250
I take your bread.

3139
02:35:26,450 --> 02:35:27,690
You are now...

3140
02:35:27,690 --> 02:35:29,590
a free ally.

3141
02:35:30,250 --> 02:35:30,910
Shoot.

3142
02:35:34,270 --> 02:35:35,490
I need more stick.

3143
02:35:41,320 --> 02:35:42,640
I need more stick.

3144
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:42,680
Perfect.

3145
02:35:43,750 --> 02:35:44,080
Yasmin!

3146
02:35:44,200 --> 02:35:45,120
Thanks for the pie I've gifted!

3147
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:53,120
Okay.

3148
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:55,020
Doki.

3149
02:35:57,820 --> 02:36:00,360
Give me one other second.

3150
02:36:01,240 --> 02:36:02,660
Give me one other second.

3151
02:36:02,660 --> 02:36:03,140
Okay.

3152
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:04,640
Here.

3153
02:36:10,110 --> 02:36:10,870
Okay.

3154
02:36:10,910 --> 02:36:11,070
Here.

3155
02:36:11,070 --> 02:36:11,070
Okay.

3156
02:36:11,070 --> 02:36:11,670
We're basically...

3157
02:36:11,670 --> 02:36:13,090
back up to where we were before.

3158
02:36:13,530 --> 02:36:13,770
Okay.

3159
02:36:13,770 --> 02:36:13,770
We're basically...

3160
02:36:13,770 --> 02:36:14,270
Okay.

3161
02:36:16,110 --> 02:36:16,870
Okay.

3162
02:36:17,850 --> 02:36:18,410
Okay.

3163
02:36:28,520 --> 02:36:29,080
Oh!

3164
02:36:29,460 --> 02:36:30,780
Did I grab it?

3165
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:31,080
Okay.

3166
02:36:31,140 --> 02:36:31,280
Good.

3167
02:36:40,300 --> 02:36:41,860
I can't get out!

3168
02:36:42,020 --> 02:36:42,580
Wait!

3169
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:43,480
Wait!

3170
02:36:44,040 --> 02:36:44,600
No!

3171
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:46,020
I can't get out!

3172
02:36:46,020 --> 02:36:47,020
I can't...

3173
02:36:47,820 --> 02:36:48,220
No!

3174
02:36:50,280 --> 02:36:52,180
Astro Bot, were you able to find...

3175
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:53,840
Big...

3176
02:36:53,840 --> 02:36:54,800
Big Boss, right?

3177
02:36:55,060 --> 02:36:56,500
Wait, they're all in the game?

3178
02:37:00,100 --> 02:37:01,400
Big Boss is in the game?

3179
02:37:02,880 --> 02:37:03,920
I think I got spoiled.

3180
02:37:07,020 --> 02:37:09,240
I think I just got spoiled on the...

3181
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:11,400
on...

3182
02:37:11,400 --> 02:37:12,280
Astro Bot.

3183
02:37:12,420 --> 02:37:13,440
No, I'm playing more Astro Bot.

3184
02:37:15,100 --> 02:37:15,500
This...

3185
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:16,560
This...

3186
02:37:17,480 --> 02:37:18,600
Wait, where was the hole?

3187
02:37:19,720 --> 02:37:20,580
Oh, here, right?

3188
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:23,480
I'm playing more this week!

3189
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:25,120
I haven't played anymore.

3190
02:37:27,280 --> 02:37:27,780
Since...

3191
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:28,660
Ah!

3192
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:35,600
When you find an ancient city, make noise.

3193
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:36,820
Oh yeah!

3194
02:37:37,480 --> 02:37:38,160
Oh yeah!

3195
02:37:39,760 --> 02:37:41,420
At least you had good intentions.

3196
02:37:43,400 --> 02:37:45,440
They mistook Solid Snake for...

3197
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:46,780
Yeah, obviously.

3198
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:47,340
Yeah.

3199
02:37:48,820 --> 02:37:49,140
Hahaha!

3200
02:37:54,180 --> 02:37:54,500
Oh!

3201
02:37:54,660 --> 02:37:54,980
Oh!

3202
02:37:55,020 --> 02:37:55,840
Okay, I've been here.

3203
02:37:55,940 --> 02:37:56,280
I've been here.

3204
02:37:56,360 --> 02:37:56,620
I've been here.

3205
02:37:58,080 --> 02:37:58,400
Okay.

3206
02:37:58,400 --> 02:37:58,960
Okey-dokey.

3207
02:37:59,700 --> 02:38:01,100
It was down here, right?

3208
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:03,180
I think we can just... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3209
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:03,600
Here we go.

3210
02:38:04,420 --> 02:38:04,740
Perfect!

3211
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:07,740
Alright, and then through here...

3212
02:38:08,740 --> 02:38:09,060
And

3213
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:12,480
then...

3214
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:14,180
We went all the way down here...

3215
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:19,160
And then...

3216
02:38:20,200 --> 02:38:22,900
The booba are easy to mix up?

3217
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:23,560
The booba are easy to mix up?

3218
02:38:23,560 --> 02:38:23,560
Obviously.

3219
02:38:23,880 --> 02:38:25,080
That was the issue.

3220
02:38:26,620 --> 02:38:27,960
Very common mistake.

3221
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:29,580
Very common mistake.

3222
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:30,660
Understandably so.

3223
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:31,260
Any diamonds?

3224
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:32,220
Yeah, I got some!

3225
02:38:32,860 --> 02:38:33,620
Alright, everybody!

3226
02:38:35,480 --> 02:38:38,660
Back to where we were, like...

3227
02:38:38,660 --> 02:38:39,460
Back to where we were, like...

3228
02:38:40,980 --> 02:38:41,620
Back to where we were, like...

3229
02:38:41,620 --> 02:38:42,140
An hour ago.

3230
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:48,380
Back to where we were.

3231
02:38:49,240 --> 02:38:51,480
Watching VTubers play Minecraft is pretty relaxing.

3232
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:51,680
Watching VTubers play Minecraft is pretty relaxing.

3233
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:52,280
I think so.

3234
02:38:55,860 --> 02:38:56,300
Watching VTubers play Minecraft is pretty relaxing.

3235
02:38:56,300 --> 02:38:56,300
I think so.

3236
02:38:56,300 --> 02:38:57,240
It's pretty chill time today.

3237
02:38:57,700 --> 02:38:58,580
Pretty chill.

3238
02:38:58,620 --> 02:39:00,340
We're just hanging out.

3239
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:01,000
Pretty chill.

3240
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:01,000
We're just hanging out.

3241
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:01,200
You know?

3242
02:39:04,040 --> 02:39:05,400
We tried to get a map.

3243
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:09,220
Okay, so someone said the map to find the place is really expensive.

3244
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:11,000
How much are we talking?

3245
02:39:11,260 --> 02:39:13,220
How many emeralds are we talking here?

3246
02:39:17,500 --> 02:39:18,800
Hope you're having a good time, Minto.

3247
02:39:18,940 --> 02:39:19,180
Yeah!

3248
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:20,120
It's all chill.

3249
02:39:20,120 --> 02:39:20,160
Yeah!

3250
02:39:26,550 --> 02:39:28,050
Twelve plus a compass?

3251
02:39:48,250 --> 02:39:49,210
Hold on.

3252
02:39:49,690 --> 02:39:50,770
Let's put a little...

3253
02:39:50,770 --> 02:39:52,630
Actually, we should be fine.

3254
02:39:52,750 --> 02:39:53,510
Let's make some more.

3255
02:39:54,670 --> 02:39:55,590
More torches.

3256
02:39:58,850 --> 02:39:59,910
Okay, that should be good.

3257
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:01,910
Okay.

3258
02:40:02,150 --> 02:40:02,630
Alright.

3259
02:40:02,890 --> 02:40:03,670
Are we ready?

3260
02:40:05,370 --> 02:40:06,350
It's so dark.

3261
02:40:07,030 --> 02:40:07,750
It's so dark.

3262
02:40:10,410 --> 02:40:10,810
Skelly?

3263
02:40:11,730 --> 02:40:12,370
Skelly a foot?

3264
02:40:14,530 --> 02:40:14,930
Skelly?

3265
02:40:14,930 --> 02:40:14,930
Skelly a foot?

3266
02:40:14,930 --> 02:40:15,250
Spider a foot?

3267
02:40:16,010 --> 02:40:17,770
Does that mean we're close to a cave, maybe?

3268
02:40:18,850 --> 02:40:19,790
Or like a...

3269
02:40:20,430 --> 02:40:21,110
Not a cave.

3270
02:40:27,030 --> 02:40:27,830
That thing...

3271
02:40:27,830 --> 02:40:30,070
That thing...

3272
02:40:37,700 --> 02:40:38,680
Sorry, I can never...

3273
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:40,420
I'm so inarticulate, you guys.

3274
02:40:40,480 --> 02:40:41,580
I can never think of any words.

3275
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:42,380
Ever.

3276
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:43,480
Diamond!

3277
02:40:48,300 --> 02:40:48,980
Diamond, diamond!

3278
02:40:49,900 --> 02:40:51,860
I think my shaders aren't working.

3279
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,960
Because I use complementary and they usually glow.

3280
02:40:54,480 --> 02:40:56,340
Aren't they supposed to glow when you find these?

3281
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:00,880
Wow!

3282
02:41:05,900 --> 02:41:06,340
Nice.

3283
02:41:06,340 --> 02:41:08,160
We have seven so far.

3284
02:41:08,300 --> 02:41:08,800
Seven diamonds.

3285
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:11,620
Out of date?

3286
02:41:11,800 --> 02:41:12,960
No, I just downloaded these.

3287
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:14,360
Hmm...

3288
02:41:18,990 --> 02:41:21,490
The word I was searching for was...

3289
02:41:22,450 --> 02:41:23,310
The mineshaft.

3290
02:41:25,470 --> 02:41:27,550
I can only focus on like three things at once.

3291
02:41:29,210 --> 02:41:29,650
Hey!

3292
02:41:38,460 --> 02:41:39,620
Come over here, Yukala.

3293
02:41:39,820 --> 02:41:40,420
Oh, oh.

3294
02:41:40,460 --> 02:41:41,320
They're coming over here.

3295
02:41:41,560 --> 02:41:42,540
They're coming over here.

3296
02:41:42,540 --> 02:41:43,780
We'll get the creeper first.

3297
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:45,260
We'll get you.

3298
02:41:45,480 --> 02:41:46,240
More diamond!

3299
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:47,940
Come here, come here.

3300
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:50,320
Blow up the diamond.

3301
02:41:50,620 --> 02:41:51,580
Blow up the diamond.

3302
02:41:54,290 --> 02:41:55,400
Oh my god!

3303
02:41:57,240 --> 02:41:57,820
Yay!

3304
02:41:59,160 --> 02:41:59,740
Diamond!

3305
02:42:01,580 --> 02:42:02,160
Wait.

3306
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:05,300
Uh oh.

3307
02:42:08,300 --> 02:42:08,880
Oh.

3308
02:42:09,900 --> 02:42:12,160
But we found another one so it doesn't matter!

3309
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:14,400
Yippee!

3310
02:42:15,460 --> 02:42:16,820
I think the diamond blew up.

3311
02:42:19,700 --> 02:42:20,020
Oops.

3312
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:22,140
That's fine.

3313
02:42:25,600 --> 02:42:26,760
Oh, there's a second creeper?

3314
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:29,260
Oh!

3315
02:42:33,170 --> 02:42:35,130
Where do you get all these arrows from anyway?

3316
02:42:37,450 --> 02:42:38,210
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3317
02:42:39,410 --> 02:42:40,610
Oh, this is bad, this is bad.

3318
02:42:41,850 --> 02:42:42,610
Come here, come here, come here.

3319
02:42:43,650 --> 02:42:44,450
We'll get the creeper?

3320
02:42:44,470 --> 02:42:44,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3321
02:42:45,070 --> 02:42:45,630
Come here, come here, come here.

3322
02:42:46,850 --> 02:42:49,290
Come here and blow this up like right here.

3323
02:42:49,490 --> 02:42:50,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3324
02:42:50,610 --> 02:42:51,870
Blow up like right here.

3325
02:42:53,310 --> 02:42:54,190
Like right...

3326
02:42:55,690 --> 02:42:56,130
here.

3327
02:42:56,390 --> 02:42:57,250
No, I'm gonna push you in.

3328
02:43:02,780 --> 02:43:03,660
Nothing else?

3329
02:43:03,880 --> 02:43:05,180
We're excavating everybody?

3330
02:43:07,440 --> 02:43:08,320
We're excavating?

3331
02:43:10,180 --> 02:43:10,620
We're excavating?

3332
02:43:10,620 --> 02:43:11,200
Where's the creeper?

3333
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:12,500
I mean the skelly.

3334
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:14,260
Actually, where is the skelly?

3335
02:43:16,080 --> 02:43:16,720
Where'd he go?

3336
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:16,740
Oh.

3337
02:43:20,910 --> 02:43:22,110
I don't wanna get caught.

3338
02:43:25,810 --> 02:43:27,190
My shield's taking a beating.

3339
02:43:27,490 --> 02:43:28,310
Yeah, it's okay.

3340
02:43:29,150 --> 02:43:30,470
It happens, you know.

3341
02:43:32,830 --> 02:43:33,510
Where'd he go?

3342
02:43:35,730 --> 02:43:36,210
Oh.

3343
02:43:36,210 --> 02:43:37,010
There he is.

3344
02:43:37,330 --> 02:43:38,410
Taking a little swim.

3345
02:43:41,310 --> 02:43:41,790
Okay.

3346
02:43:41,790 --> 02:43:42,270
Onwards!

3347
02:43:48,130 --> 02:43:48,610
Yeah!

3348
02:43:49,090 --> 02:43:49,750
Oh yeah!

3349
02:43:52,430 --> 02:43:53,870
I'm almost out of...

3350
02:43:53,870 --> 02:43:55,590
I'm out of...

3351
02:43:59,190 --> 02:44:02,210
I'm out of torches and I can't see anything.

3352
02:44:09,150 --> 02:44:10,570
Maybe in here.

3353
02:44:11,150 --> 02:44:11,830
Anything?

3354
02:44:13,670 --> 02:44:14,670
New recipe.

3355
02:44:15,310 --> 02:44:16,230
Oh, cause of the bone.

3356
02:44:17,770 --> 02:44:18,450
No!

3357
02:44:18,750 --> 02:44:19,890
Nothing here.

3358
02:44:20,010 --> 02:44:21,050
Nothing here.

3359
02:44:21,490 --> 02:44:23,310
I'll take this iron though since we're here.

3360
02:44:30,310 --> 02:44:32,170
Hopefully we can find some more coal.

3361
02:44:32,390 --> 02:44:33,050
I have coal.

3362
02:44:33,910 --> 02:44:35,710
But you know, just more too.

3363
02:44:37,270 --> 02:44:38,230
Nothing here.

3364
02:44:38,910 --> 02:44:39,510
Let's see.

3365
02:44:39,630 --> 02:44:39,930
Alright.

3366
02:44:41,150 --> 02:44:41,630
Sticks.

3367
02:44:44,310 --> 02:44:44,910
Oh no.

3368
02:44:46,310 --> 02:44:46,790
Torch!

3369
02:44:47,490 --> 02:44:48,750
Oh, I didn't mean to make that.

3370
02:44:50,870 --> 02:44:51,350
Oh!

3371
02:44:51,530 --> 02:44:52,430
I have too many!

3372
02:44:52,750 --> 02:44:53,530
There we go.

3373
02:44:54,630 --> 02:44:55,110
Perfect.

3374
02:44:56,730 --> 02:44:57,650
Let's go the other way.

3375
02:45:00,870 --> 02:45:01,550
Okay.

3376
02:45:04,930 --> 02:45:05,950
This way.

3377
02:45:07,030 --> 02:45:08,150
We're exploring.

3378
02:45:09,690 --> 02:45:11,050
We're adventuring.

3379
02:45:12,830 --> 02:45:13,950
We're having a...

3380
02:45:14,990 --> 02:45:16,090
mindful time.

3381
02:45:20,240 --> 02:45:20,940
Haven't died yet!

3382
02:45:22,280 --> 02:45:24,640
I might be a genius at this game.

3383
02:45:26,620 --> 02:45:28,000
Wasn't there a guy over here?

3384
02:45:28,620 --> 02:45:29,180
Oh.

3385
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:29,760
Whoa.

3386
02:45:31,140 --> 02:45:31,660
Okay.

3387
02:45:32,040 --> 02:45:34,580
This gets a little...

3388
02:45:35,940 --> 02:45:36,460
Nope.

3389
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:37,140
Nothing up here.

3390
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:40,520
Pro Minecrafter!

3391
02:45:41,300 --> 02:45:41,820
Professional!

3392
02:45:43,700 --> 02:45:44,640
How do I...

3393
02:45:44,640 --> 02:45:45,540
Let's see.

3394
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:48,440
Umm...

3395
02:45:52,900 --> 02:45:55,460
One of these ways will lead to the trials.

3396
02:45:56,040 --> 02:45:57,000
The trial chambers.

3397
02:45:57,900 --> 02:45:58,360
Oh.

3398
02:45:58,400 --> 02:45:58,820
Ouch.

3399
02:46:01,670 --> 02:46:04,110
You guys, I don't think there's any going back up anymore.

3400
02:46:04,550 --> 02:46:05,550
I'm absolutely...

3401
02:46:05,710 --> 02:46:06,390
lost.

3402
02:46:08,910 --> 02:46:10,790
Going up is not an option anymore.

3403
02:46:11,190 --> 02:46:12,770
These caves are ours.

3404
02:46:18,360 --> 02:46:19,840
These caves are ours.

3405
02:46:21,300 --> 02:46:22,720
And all I got are berries.

3406
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:25,020
Yeah, we live down here now.

3407
02:46:30,600 --> 02:46:32,460
Once I run out of these berries...

3408
02:46:33,620 --> 02:46:35,200
I really have, like, nothing else.

3409
02:46:40,120 --> 02:46:41,300
I'm a professional...

3410
02:46:41,300 --> 02:46:41,940
and I'm prepared.

3411
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:46,900
And also there's nothing here!

3412
02:46:47,720 --> 02:46:49,360
I do have a little bit of potatoes.

3413
02:46:49,800 --> 02:46:50,840
I just gotta cook them.

3414
02:46:51,420 --> 02:46:52,520
Gotta cook them, potatoes.

3415
02:46:53,140 --> 02:46:54,480
Let's just keep digging...

3416
02:46:54,480 --> 02:46:55,320
this way then.

3417
02:46:56,740 --> 02:46:58,280
We'll just pick a corner and go.

3418
02:47:01,860 --> 02:47:02,560
Down here.

3419
02:47:02,560 --> 02:47:05,020
100 day day cave...

3420
02:47:05,020 --> 02:47:05,160
challenge.

3421
02:47:06,200 --> 02:47:08,620
100 day cave challenge!

3422
02:47:08,840 --> 02:47:09,020
Yes.

3423
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:10,720
I hear a skelly.

3424
02:47:11,500 --> 02:47:11,940
Somewhere.

3425
02:47:13,400 --> 02:47:14,280
Over yonder.

3426
02:47:18,340 --> 02:47:20,360
I don't know if we can plant the...

3427
02:47:23,140 --> 02:47:24,340
I don't have any dirt.

3428
02:47:24,420 --> 02:47:24,620
Do I?

3429
02:47:24,680 --> 02:47:25,040
I do!

3430
02:47:25,700 --> 02:47:26,580
Hold on, let's see.

3431
02:47:30,500 --> 02:47:30,940
Oh!

3432
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:33,720
Shut up!

3433
02:47:35,060 --> 02:47:37,220
And then we can just keep bone-mealing them.

3434
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:38,680
You guys, this might actually be possible.

3435
02:47:43,550 --> 02:47:44,810
Oh my gosh!

3436
02:47:45,430 --> 02:47:47,090
Yeah, I see the weird spammer.

3437
02:47:47,190 --> 02:47:47,450
It's okay.

3438
02:47:48,650 --> 02:47:50,650
Yeah, I'm gonna change the subscribe thing.

3439
02:47:54,490 --> 02:47:55,070
Let's see.

3440
02:48:01,070 --> 02:48:01,770
There we go.

3441
02:48:03,430 --> 02:48:05,730
I think Minecraft is bringing out the children.

3442
02:48:05,850 --> 02:48:06,590
So it's a little weird.

3443
02:48:06,750 --> 02:48:07,150
Just ignore.

3444
02:48:07,370 --> 02:48:07,670
It's okay.

3445
02:48:09,790 --> 02:48:10,310
It's okay.

3446
02:48:11,330 --> 02:48:12,170
I'm not bothered.

3447
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:21,100
Let's see.

3448
02:48:24,900 --> 02:48:26,060
Berries need level...

3449
02:48:26,060 --> 02:48:26,860
Light level 9.

3450
02:48:28,020 --> 02:48:29,900
But if I bone-meal it, it's fine.

3451
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:30,200
Right?

3452
02:48:30,260 --> 02:48:32,120
But also, this is light level 9?

3453
02:48:32,400 --> 02:48:33,180
What are we at?

3454
02:48:33,180 --> 02:48:33,560
What are we at?

3455
02:48:34,720 --> 02:48:35,680
Light 11.

3456
02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:37,860
Light 11.

3457
02:48:39,700 --> 02:48:41,040
I'm sad I missed it.

3458
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:44,160
It's some kid that's just like, I will sigma you.

3459
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:51,180
Everybody sigma.

3460
02:48:52,140 --> 02:48:53,620
I really like the BGM.

3461
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:54,000
It's soothing.

3462
02:48:54,260 --> 02:48:55,880
Oh, someone asked about it earlier.

3463
02:48:56,300 --> 02:48:57,660
Whoever asked about it earlier.

3464
02:48:57,700 --> 02:48:58,100
Let me check.

3465
02:48:58,140 --> 02:48:58,960
I'm in a good spot now.

3466
02:48:59,800 --> 02:49:00,280
Uh...

3467
02:49:01,180 --> 02:49:02,640
Uh... It's in Japanese.

3468
02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:04,740
So it probably would be easier for me to just link it.

3469
02:49:04,840 --> 02:49:05,020
Right?

3470
02:49:06,260 --> 02:49:06,780
Hold on.

3471
02:49:06,820 --> 02:49:07,260
Give me a second.

3472
02:49:12,800 --> 02:49:14,400
You might hear it for like 2 seconds.

3473
02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:14,720
There we go.

3474
02:49:16,300 --> 02:49:17,060
This one.

3475
02:49:18,820 --> 02:49:19,980
That's the BGM for today.

3476
02:49:21,860 --> 02:49:22,560
Sigma, Ohio.

3477
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:23,720
Skippity Breeze.

3478
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:23,960
Yeah.

3479
02:49:24,500 --> 02:49:24,980
Hahaha.

3480
02:49:32,140 --> 02:49:33,200
Is this drippy?

3481
02:49:34,860 --> 02:49:35,780
No, I don't think so.

3482
02:49:37,560 --> 02:49:38,040
Uh...

3483
02:49:38,040 --> 02:49:38,880
Let's go!

3484
02:49:40,040 --> 02:49:40,520
Uh...

3485
02:49:45,560 --> 02:49:46,040
Brrrr.

3486
02:49:46,880 --> 02:49:47,700
I think I...

3487
02:49:47,700 --> 02:49:48,260
Okay, here we go.

3488
02:49:48,380 --> 02:49:49,260
I was gonna say.

3489
02:49:50,360 --> 02:49:51,420
There's probably a way.

3490
02:49:52,320 --> 02:49:53,120
Around here.

3491
02:49:59,880 --> 02:50:00,760
Skippity, skippity.

3492
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:03,380
I don't like Minecraft.

3493
02:50:03,820 --> 02:50:05,780
I only like Skippity Toilet.

3494
02:50:06,220 --> 02:50:06,600
Hahaha.

3495
02:50:08,700 --> 02:50:09,220
Hahaha.

3496
02:50:10,740 --> 02:50:11,940
Do you think they're growing?

3497
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:15,140
I actually can't tell at all.

3498
02:50:15,380 --> 02:50:17,780
We need a skelly so we can...

3499
02:50:18,940 --> 02:50:20,020
So we can...

3500
02:50:20,020 --> 02:50:21,520
This seems like a...

3501
02:50:21,520 --> 02:50:21,980
Okay, hold on.

3502
02:50:22,080 --> 02:50:25,860
Let's make this a little bit more fortified.

3503
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:27,640
Let's make this a little bit more fortified.

3504
02:50:34,480 --> 02:50:35,000
Okay.

3505
02:50:35,940 --> 02:50:36,460
Okay.

3506
02:50:37,320 --> 02:50:39,020
I don't know where they are.

3507
02:50:39,300 --> 02:50:39,820
But...

3508
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:42,680
They're making a whole lot of noise.

3509
02:50:46,620 --> 02:50:47,140
Okay.

3510
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:48,400
That's better.

3511
02:50:49,060 --> 02:50:49,840
That's better.

3512
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:52,640
Onward.

3513
02:50:54,280 --> 02:50:54,800
Oh.

3514
02:50:55,980 --> 02:50:56,500
Onward!

3515
02:50:59,020 --> 02:51:00,140
What are we at anyway?

3516
02:51:01,060 --> 02:51:01,820
Negative 18.

3517
02:51:08,560 --> 02:51:08,960
Hmm...

3518
02:51:09,400 --> 02:51:09,800
Wait.

3519
02:51:11,340 --> 02:51:12,760
Oh, there he is.

3520
02:51:13,840 --> 02:51:14,240
Hahaha.

3521
02:51:14,580 --> 02:51:15,420
Can you get through here?

3522
02:51:17,580 --> 02:51:18,720
Can you get up here?

3523
02:51:27,300 --> 02:51:28,520
Maybe I should just take him out.

3524
02:51:36,360 --> 02:51:36,760
Awesome.

3525
02:51:42,080 --> 02:51:45,480
If Ocelot was Gen Z and said that during Virtuous Mission, I wouldn't hesitate.

3526
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:46,960
To create a time paradox.

3527
02:51:49,440 --> 02:51:50,700
What are you talking about?

3528
02:51:50,860 --> 02:51:52,260
That would be the hip thing then.

3529
02:51:55,080 --> 02:51:58,060
If Ocelot says anything, I'll just go with it.

3530
02:51:58,140 --> 02:51:58,840
To be honest.

3531
02:51:59,460 --> 02:52:01,040
I'll be like, okay, Ocelot.

3532
02:52:01,540 --> 02:52:02,420
I believe you.

3533
02:52:03,440 --> 02:52:04,260
Negative 28.

3534
02:52:05,120 --> 02:52:06,020
Let's just go forward.

3535
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:09,240
You guys...

3536
02:52:09,240 --> 02:52:10,180
I'm in a bit of a pickle.

3537
02:52:10,360 --> 02:52:11,300
I gotta go to the bathroom.

3538
02:52:11,300 --> 02:52:13,700
I gotta go to the little ghosty's room.

3539
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:16,840
Do you think I'll be safe?

3540
02:52:17,300 --> 02:52:18,380
If I just chill here?

3541
02:52:33,070 --> 02:52:33,510
Oh.

3542
02:52:35,930 --> 02:52:36,510
Hold it.

3543
02:52:37,230 --> 02:52:37,670
Hahaha.

3544
02:52:39,510 --> 02:52:39,950
Wait.

3545
02:52:40,130 --> 02:52:40,550
Actually.

3546
02:52:40,670 --> 02:52:42,050
Oh, this does pause the game.

3547
02:52:42,170 --> 02:52:43,410
Because I'm not on a server.

3548
02:52:43,690 --> 02:52:44,570
Okay, I'll be right back.

3549
02:52:45,430 --> 02:52:46,990
I'll be right back.

3550
02:52:47,210 --> 02:52:51,010
I forgot it's single player.

3551
02:52:51,550 --> 02:52:52,270
I forgot.

3552
02:52:52,270 --> 02:52:52,590
I forgot.

3553
02:52:52,890 --> 02:52:54,350
Yeah, I'm in single player.

3554
02:52:56,030 --> 02:52:57,510
You're not in a pickle, you're in a cave.

3555
02:52:57,910 --> 02:52:58,170
Hahaha.

3556
02:52:59,210 --> 02:52:59,810
Missile.

3557
02:53:02,270 --> 02:53:03,690
Hold on, I gotta stretch.

3558
02:53:07,110 --> 02:53:07,710
Okay.

3559
02:53:10,830 --> 02:53:11,430
BRB.

3560
02:55:17,490 --> 02:55:18,090
Whoa.

3561
02:55:19,670 --> 02:55:21,070
Sigma Rizzler, Ohio.

3562
02:55:22,530 --> 02:55:23,350
I'm back.

3563
02:55:23,950 --> 02:55:24,490
Hahaha.

3564
02:55:25,770 --> 02:55:26,510
I'm back.

3565
02:55:27,330 --> 02:55:27,850
Okay.

3566
02:55:28,490 --> 02:55:29,270
Everything's fine.

3567
02:55:30,190 --> 02:55:31,010
Everything's safe.

3568
02:55:32,190 --> 02:55:32,710
Hahaha.

3569
02:55:37,200 --> 02:55:37,720
Stop.

3570
02:55:38,440 --> 02:55:40,200
You guys, I'm just being hip and cool.

3571
02:55:41,180 --> 02:55:42,180
What is that?

3572
02:55:43,780 --> 02:55:44,620
Is it moving?

3573
02:55:46,880 --> 02:55:47,900
Am I crazy?

3574
02:55:48,480 --> 02:55:49,280
What is that?

3575
02:55:56,570 --> 02:55:57,530
Oh, it's a bat!

3576
02:55:58,550 --> 02:56:01,550
I was like, there's something there for real.

3577
02:56:01,550 --> 02:56:03,310
There's diamonds, too.

3578
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:11,000
Oh!

3579
02:56:11,180 --> 02:56:12,860
I'm not gone fishing no more.

3580
02:56:16,340 --> 02:56:17,240
I'm back.

3581
02:56:18,120 --> 02:56:18,640
I'm back.

3582
02:56:18,640 --> 02:56:19,220
Scooby-Doo cat.

3583
02:56:19,900 --> 02:56:20,500
Rizzler.

3584
02:56:20,560 --> 02:56:20,920
Hahaha.

3585
02:56:33,750 --> 02:56:34,350
Oh!

3586
02:56:36,590 --> 02:56:39,390
We found an amethyst geode!

3587
02:56:39,770 --> 02:56:40,070
We found an amethyst geode!

3588
02:56:42,130 --> 02:56:42,730
Wow!

3589
02:56:47,190 --> 02:56:48,410
We got a geode!

3590
02:56:49,310 --> 02:56:50,390
It's kind of small, though.

3591
02:56:52,690 --> 02:56:53,570
It's a little small.

3592
02:56:55,910 --> 02:56:57,490
Oh, I have no space for it.

3593
02:56:57,870 --> 02:56:58,230
Uh...

3594
02:57:01,170 --> 02:57:02,070
Oh, I need to eat.

3595
02:57:02,630 --> 02:57:04,050
I'm gonna eat my golden apple.

3596
02:57:04,250 --> 02:57:06,170
Some people might say that's a really bad idea.

3597
02:57:06,310 --> 02:57:06,690
Actually, no.

3598
02:57:06,790 --> 02:57:07,790
We can get rid of the andesite.

3599
02:57:08,970 --> 02:57:09,470
What was that?

3600
02:57:09,510 --> 02:57:10,150
What did I throw away?

3601
02:57:13,690 --> 02:57:14,050
Oh!

3602
02:57:14,890 --> 02:57:15,470
No, no, no!

3603
02:57:16,150 --> 02:57:16,690
There we go.

3604
02:57:17,950 --> 02:57:18,850
I just want one.

3605
02:57:19,850 --> 02:57:20,970
As, like, a little treat.

3606
02:57:20,990 --> 02:57:21,210
You know?

3607
02:57:22,590 --> 02:57:23,490
What about the pumpkins?

3608
02:57:24,150 --> 02:57:25,110
I throw those away.

3609
02:57:28,690 --> 02:57:29,910
I threw those away.

3610
02:57:30,850 --> 02:57:31,930
A long time ago.

3611
02:57:32,910 --> 02:57:33,550
I think.

3612
02:57:34,190 --> 02:57:34,590
Actually.

3613
02:57:35,210 --> 02:57:37,230
It's been quite a while since I've seen the pumpkins.

3614
02:57:38,350 --> 02:57:38,750
Yeah.

3615
02:57:40,710 --> 02:57:41,910
Do you guys think we're close?

3616
02:57:43,010 --> 02:57:43,790
To the trials?

3617
02:57:47,170 --> 02:57:48,070
I think we're almost there.

3618
02:57:49,570 --> 02:57:49,930
Oh!

3619
02:57:50,050 --> 02:57:50,550
Oh!

3620
02:57:51,170 --> 02:57:52,790
Oh yeah!

3621
02:57:58,640 --> 02:57:59,520
Oh yeah!

3622
02:58:01,420 --> 02:58:04,100
Look at him grow!

3623
02:58:04,360 --> 02:58:05,060
Look at him spin!

3624
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:07,360
Wow!

3625
02:58:08,220 --> 02:58:10,020
There was nobody spawned here.

3626
02:58:10,320 --> 02:58:11,660
I got another golden apple!

3627
02:58:14,140 --> 02:58:15,180
And some bread.

3628
02:58:16,580 --> 02:58:17,940
Put some dirt away.

3629
02:58:18,780 --> 02:58:19,420
Nametag!

3630
02:58:24,400 --> 02:58:27,500
Dear Mini Minto has ascended and in turn equally big...

3631
02:58:27,500 --> 02:58:28,240
Dear Bigger.

3632
02:58:28,420 --> 02:58:30,500
But still small and cute Minto has returned.

3633
02:58:32,780 --> 02:58:33,340
Yeah!

3634
02:58:33,820 --> 02:58:34,380
Yeah!

3635
02:58:36,160 --> 02:58:36,720
Wow!

3636
02:58:37,300 --> 02:58:39,440
Did you see me rollin'?

3637
02:58:39,440 --> 02:58:41,720
They hatin'!

3638
02:58:48,050 --> 02:58:49,370
Maybe through here.

3639
02:58:54,640 --> 02:58:55,200
Oh!

3640
02:58:55,400 --> 02:58:56,820
If only I had a...

3641
02:58:57,520 --> 02:58:58,460
If only I had a...

3642
02:59:08,220 --> 02:59:08,860
Got him.

3643
02:59:09,080 --> 02:59:09,980
Got his butt.

3644
02:59:10,440 --> 02:59:12,340
If only I had a bow and arrow tool.

3645
02:59:13,120 --> 02:59:13,560
If only I had a bow and arrow tool.

3646
02:59:13,660 --> 02:59:15,960
I feel ancient hearing those lyrics.

3647
02:59:16,760 --> 02:59:17,620
I feel ancient hearing those lyrics.

3648
02:59:18,420 --> 02:59:19,520
You're in good company!

3649
02:59:19,660 --> 02:59:21,080
We're all ancient together, you know?

3650
02:59:21,160 --> 02:59:22,840
I have to be ancient to know those lyrics.

3651
02:59:23,240 --> 02:59:23,640
Right.

3652
02:59:29,620 --> 02:59:31,980
I'm gonna be able to make diamond armor at this point, you guys.

3653
02:59:32,200 --> 02:59:32,840
For real.

3654
02:59:34,280 --> 02:59:35,040
No jokes.

3655
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:36,480
How many do I have?

3656
02:59:36,540 --> 02:59:37,080
I have twelve!

3657
02:59:45,470 --> 02:59:46,470
What should we make?

3658
02:59:46,510 --> 02:59:47,110
What should we make?

3659
02:59:47,450 --> 02:59:49,510
Maybe the pants, cause those are the weakest.

3660
02:59:50,470 --> 02:59:51,710
Actually, which is the weakest?

3661
02:59:52,290 --> 02:59:52,670
Pants?

3662
02:59:53,850 --> 02:59:55,110
Oh, never mind.

3663
02:59:55,250 --> 02:59:55,630
Boots!

3664
02:59:58,530 --> 03:00:00,450
But the pants will break so easily, right?

3665
03:00:11,190 --> 03:00:12,310
Oh, a sword!

3666
03:00:12,490 --> 03:00:13,810
Yeah, that might be good too, actually.

3667
03:00:13,810 --> 03:00:14,070
Right.

3668
03:00:18,810 --> 03:00:22,410
We haven't found one of those, like, giant cave rooms yet.

3669
03:00:27,070 --> 03:00:28,590
We're just kinda vibing in here.

3670
03:00:29,010 --> 03:00:31,150
I'm kinda sad my shaders don't seem to work.

3671
03:00:31,390 --> 03:00:32,610
I mean, they work, but like...

3672
03:00:33,230 --> 03:00:36,670
Like I said, I have the complimentary one set up, and they aren't...

3673
03:00:38,570 --> 03:00:39,710
They aren't doing their job.

3674
03:00:39,870 --> 03:00:41,110
There's so many diamonds in here!

3675
03:00:43,490 --> 03:00:44,130
So many!

3676
03:00:45,010 --> 03:00:45,430
Okay.

3677
03:00:45,430 --> 03:00:46,870
After I get all these...

3678
03:00:47,310 --> 03:00:49,650
We're gonna craft some stuff.

3679
03:00:50,450 --> 03:00:51,970
We're gonna actually play the game.

3680
03:00:53,410 --> 03:00:54,830
We're rich, baby!

3681
03:00:55,470 --> 03:00:57,610
Oh, but all the guys only want emeralds.

3682
03:00:58,010 --> 03:00:58,850
They don't want diamonds.

3683
03:01:01,410 --> 03:01:02,090
Let's see.

3684
03:01:02,270 --> 03:01:03,590
Where's my crafting table?

3685
03:01:03,650 --> 03:01:03,950
Here we go.

3686
03:01:05,450 --> 03:01:06,610
So what should I craft?

3687
03:01:07,750 --> 03:01:08,970
I can make pants!

3688
03:01:09,210 --> 03:01:09,790
I can make pants!

3689
03:01:19,380 --> 03:01:19,940
Sword?

3690
03:01:21,780 --> 03:01:22,340
Oh.

3691
03:01:22,460 --> 03:01:24,180
I was gonna say, I don't have enough for a sword.

3692
03:01:26,420 --> 03:01:26,760
Um...

3693
03:01:29,200 --> 03:01:30,860
I just realized I don't need this wool.

3694
03:01:31,540 --> 03:01:32,340
Actually, give it back.

3695
03:01:35,540 --> 03:01:36,340
I do need it.

3696
03:01:40,780 --> 03:01:41,460
A sword!

3697
03:01:42,060 --> 03:01:43,160
A sword, a sword!

3698
03:01:46,400 --> 03:01:46,740
Yeah!

3699
03:01:47,980 --> 03:01:49,840
You mean you haven't been playing the game up to this point?

3700
03:01:49,960 --> 03:01:50,220
Nah.

3701
03:01:50,580 --> 03:01:51,940
This has all been pre-recorded.

3702
03:01:54,780 --> 03:01:55,220
Gotcha!

3703
03:01:56,120 --> 03:01:56,560
Gotcha!

3704
03:01:57,760 --> 03:01:58,600
And a pick.

3705
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:00,600
And a pick.

3706
03:02:01,420 --> 03:02:01,860
Goodbye!

3707
03:02:03,080 --> 03:02:03,520
You?

3708
03:02:06,120 --> 03:02:07,000
I hoarder.

3709
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,080
I like keep all my old tools, you know?

3710
03:02:09,200 --> 03:02:10,300
I don't know if you guys have noticed.

3711
03:02:23,300 --> 03:02:23,860
Oh, wait.

3712
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:25,900
Switch this out.

3713
03:02:25,980 --> 03:02:26,320
There we go.

3714
03:02:30,140 --> 03:02:30,920
Zombie noise.

3715
03:02:31,140 --> 03:02:31,320
Zombie noise.

3716
03:02:32,440 --> 03:02:33,040
Really?

3717
03:02:33,960 --> 03:02:35,400
Just... to nowhere?

3718
03:02:37,320 --> 03:02:37,920
Hmm...

3719
03:02:37,920 --> 03:02:39,180
I'm trying to decide which way I want to go.

3720
03:02:40,400 --> 03:02:41,000
Hmm...

3721
03:02:45,650 --> 03:02:46,850
It's bothering?

3722
03:02:49,030 --> 03:02:49,630
Good.

3723
03:02:51,010 --> 03:02:51,990
Be bothered.

3724
03:02:52,570 --> 03:02:53,530
Be bothered.

3725
03:02:54,570 --> 03:02:55,430
It's fine.

3726
03:02:55,570 --> 03:02:56,830
What else am I gonna get down here?

3727
03:02:57,010 --> 03:02:58,310
Just a bunch of bricks?

3728
03:03:00,150 --> 03:03:01,230
Doesn't matter.

3729
03:03:01,230 --> 03:03:02,210
Doesn't matter.

3730
03:03:05,090 --> 03:03:06,730
This is where I came from, right?

3731
03:03:06,870 --> 03:03:07,070
Okay.

3732
03:03:07,190 --> 03:03:07,610
Let's go.

3733
03:03:08,850 --> 03:03:09,330
Oh!

3734
03:03:12,590 --> 03:03:14,890
You guys, this might be where I die.

3735
03:03:22,950 --> 03:03:23,910
You guys...

3736
03:03:25,770 --> 03:03:26,730
You guys!

3737
03:03:27,150 --> 03:03:27,770
You guys!

3738
03:03:27,770 --> 03:03:28,670
Oh!

3739
03:03:34,460 --> 03:03:35,020
Oh,

3740
03:03:38,720 --> 03:03:39,000
God!

3741
03:03:39,340 --> 03:03:40,380
Not another one!

3742
03:03:40,940 --> 03:03:41,320
No!

3743
03:03:41,440 --> 03:03:41,900
I

3744
03:03:50,460 --> 03:03:51,080
lived!

3745
03:03:51,100 --> 03:03:51,760
I lived!

3746
03:03:51,780 --> 03:03:52,500
I lived!

3747
03:03:52,520 --> 03:03:53,180
Tell the tale!

3748
03:03:57,550 --> 03:03:59,510
Oh, my gosh!

3749
03:03:59,630 --> 03:04:00,650
It turned the corner.

3750
03:04:00,730 --> 03:04:01,670
It's just mayhem.

3751
03:04:01,950 --> 03:04:02,690
Oh, wait.

3752
03:04:02,730 --> 03:04:03,550
I've been here before.

3753
03:04:03,790 --> 03:04:04,150
What?

3754
03:04:04,250 --> 03:04:04,870
I have?

3755
03:04:11,120 --> 03:04:12,840
Oh, I lived!

3756
03:04:12,840 --> 03:04:13,620
I lived!

3757
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:17,280
Yeah!

3758
03:04:18,240 --> 03:04:18,280
Yeah!

3759
03:04:20,820 --> 03:04:22,180
My shield's a little...

3760
03:04:22,180 --> 03:04:22,680
Oh, wait.

3761
03:04:23,260 --> 03:04:24,220
I left my...

3762
03:04:24,220 --> 03:04:25,680
My crafting table.

3763
03:04:25,880 --> 03:04:26,840
Wait, where did I leave it?

3764
03:04:27,860 --> 03:04:29,180
Try not to die, VTuber.

3765
03:04:30,020 --> 03:04:30,900
Very simple.

3766
03:04:33,440 --> 03:04:34,580
I was down...

3767
03:04:37,580 --> 03:04:38,320
Oh, there it is.

3768
03:04:40,420 --> 03:04:41,320
Items are precious.

3769
03:04:41,600 --> 03:04:43,660
We can't just throw away something like this, you know?

3770
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:46,660
I don't have any wood.

3771
03:04:48,240 --> 03:04:49,640
Super chat made me puke.

3772
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:52,600
It's okay.

3773
03:04:52,680 --> 03:04:53,120
I forgive you.

3774
03:04:54,860 --> 03:04:56,320
Chat, do we forgive turtles?

3775
03:04:57,780 --> 03:04:58,800
Decide their fate.

3776
03:04:59,520 --> 03:05:01,660
Turtles, your fate will be decided by the...

3777
03:05:01,660 --> 03:05:01,920
Oh, wait!

3778
03:05:01,960 --> 03:05:02,740
I do have pumpkins!

3779
03:05:03,540 --> 03:05:04,740
I can't eat them, though.

3780
03:05:07,540 --> 03:05:09,280
I'm gonna leave a little pumpkin trail.

3781
03:05:13,880 --> 03:05:14,360
No!

3782
03:05:14,940 --> 03:05:15,940
No mercy!

3783
03:05:15,940 --> 03:05:16,080
No mercy!

3784
03:05:17,740 --> 03:05:18,620
Your punishment?

3785
03:05:19,260 --> 03:05:19,780
Soup.

3786
03:05:19,980 --> 03:05:20,440
Soup.

3787
03:05:20,740 --> 03:05:21,160
Soup.

3788
03:05:21,260 --> 03:05:21,780
Soup.

3789
03:05:21,780 --> 03:05:22,240
Soup.

3790
03:05:22,380 --> 03:05:22,680
Soup.

3791
03:05:22,780 --> 03:05:23,300
Oh!

3792
03:05:23,560 --> 03:05:24,580
I just noticed my health.

3793
03:05:30,400 --> 03:05:30,920
Soup.

3794
03:05:31,080 --> 03:05:31,400
Soup.

3795
03:05:31,600 --> 03:05:31,920
Soup.

3796
03:05:32,140 --> 03:05:32,400
Soup.

3797
03:05:32,540 --> 03:05:32,740
Soup.

3798
03:05:32,960 --> 03:05:33,120
Soup.

3799
03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:33,240
Soup.

3800
03:05:33,400 --> 03:05:35,800
This is where I was going, right?

3801
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:36,740
Oh, gosh.

3802
03:05:36,920 --> 03:05:38,080
I can't remember anything.

3803
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:43,220
Is this where I was going?

3804
03:05:43,800 --> 03:05:44,840
Is this where I've been?

3805
03:05:45,760 --> 03:05:46,880
Nothing makes sense anymore.

3806
03:05:53,160 --> 03:05:53,600
Oh, wait.

3807
03:05:53,620 --> 03:05:54,540
This is where I...

3808
03:05:54,540 --> 03:05:56,640
Where did I go?

3809
03:05:56,760 --> 03:05:57,500
Where did I come from?

3810
03:05:58,580 --> 03:05:59,220
Hot Nigel.

3811
03:06:01,540 --> 03:06:02,060
This way.

3812
03:06:02,140 --> 03:06:02,460
This way.

3813
03:06:02,520 --> 03:06:02,800
This way.

3814
03:06:02,800 --> 03:06:03,120
This way.

3815
03:06:03,120 --> 03:06:03,360
This way.

3816
03:06:03,420 --> 03:06:03,800
This way.

3817
03:06:03,900 --> 03:06:04,140
This way.

3818
03:06:04,720 --> 03:06:05,220
This way.

3819
03:06:05,500 --> 03:06:05,760
This way.

3820
03:06:05,780 --> 03:06:06,300
This way.

3821
03:06:06,600 --> 03:06:07,060
This way.

3822
03:06:07,140 --> 03:06:07,300
This way.

3823
03:06:07,360 --> 03:06:07,360
This way.

3824
03:06:07,360 --> 03:06:07,580
This way.

3825
03:06:08,400 --> 03:06:09,440
Does it lead to anything?

3826
03:06:10,840 --> 03:06:11,300
Up here.

3827
03:06:13,940 --> 03:06:14,400
Oh, gosh.

3828
03:06:16,100 --> 03:06:16,460
Imagine...

3829
03:06:16,460 --> 03:06:18,520
I was going to say imagine I lit up...

3830
03:06:18,520 --> 03:06:19,860
lit back up and there was a guy.

3831
03:06:20,120 --> 03:06:20,680
Oh, my gosh.

3832
03:06:20,720 --> 03:06:21,620
He got little booties on.

3833
03:06:22,440 --> 03:06:23,300
Where did you get those?

3834
03:06:23,580 --> 03:06:24,160
Can I have them?

3835
03:06:26,300 --> 03:06:26,660
No?

3836
03:06:37,290 --> 03:06:37,850
Take back.

3837
03:06:41,150 --> 03:06:41,510
Okay.

3838
03:06:42,490 --> 03:06:43,210
This way then?

3839
03:06:44,730 --> 03:06:46,290
You guys, we're so close to the trial.

3840
03:06:46,510 --> 03:06:47,570
I can smell it.

3841
03:06:47,590 --> 03:06:48,250
I can smell it.

3842
03:06:48,290 --> 03:06:48,850
I can smell it.

3843
03:06:50,410 --> 03:06:51,630
I can smell the trial.

3844
03:06:54,350 --> 03:06:55,230
We're even at...

3845
03:06:55,230 --> 03:06:55,590
We're even at...

3846
03:06:55,590 --> 03:06:56,110
negative 43.

3847
03:06:58,950 --> 03:07:00,290
We're so deep in, you guys.

3848
03:07:00,390 --> 03:07:01,650
I don't think we can be any deeper.

3849
03:07:04,390 --> 03:07:05,730
Actually, I'm just going to go to this corner.

3850
03:07:06,210 --> 03:07:07,090
And I'm going to dig out.

3851
03:07:07,450 --> 03:07:07,930
Here we go.

3852
03:07:08,110 --> 03:07:08,910
We're going to dig this way.

3853
03:07:10,350 --> 03:07:11,530
So close and yet so far.

3854
03:07:11,630 --> 03:07:12,090
You don't know.

3855
03:07:12,210 --> 03:07:12,630
You don't know.

3856
03:07:12,710 --> 03:07:13,090
You don't know.

3857
03:07:13,850 --> 03:07:14,810
We're going to run out of food.

3858
03:07:15,590 --> 03:07:16,810
No, we won't.

3859
03:07:18,170 --> 03:07:19,630
We're going to find the trial before then.

3860
03:07:20,230 --> 03:07:20,510
We're going to find the trial before then.

3861
03:07:32,200 --> 03:07:34,240
What even is a trial?

3862
03:07:35,080 --> 03:07:35,100
What even is a trial?

3863
03:07:36,100 --> 03:07:36,580
Right?

3864
03:07:38,900 --> 03:07:40,240
She won't have a crafting table.

3865
03:07:40,340 --> 03:07:40,960
No, I have one.

3866
03:07:42,300 --> 03:07:42,780
Oh.

3867
03:07:43,740 --> 03:07:44,860
Wait, where is it?

3868
03:07:45,320 --> 03:07:46,320
I picked it.

3869
03:07:47,100 --> 03:07:48,140
Wait, where is my crafting table?

3870
03:07:56,110 --> 03:07:57,590
Where did I put it?

3871
03:07:58,090 --> 03:07:58,570
Where did I put it?

3872
03:08:02,950 --> 03:08:05,430
I might not have a crafting table.

3873
03:08:05,610 --> 03:08:06,310
But it's fine.

3874
03:08:06,710 --> 03:08:07,810
I got it all.

3875
03:08:07,830 --> 03:08:09,070
Up here, baby.

3876
03:08:12,150 --> 03:08:13,410
I've got it all.

3877
03:08:13,550 --> 03:08:14,390
Up here.

3878
03:08:16,770 --> 03:08:18,790
I picked up the axe instead.

3879
03:08:19,470 --> 03:08:20,070
No!

3880
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,260
How could I be such a fool?

3881
03:08:40,420 --> 03:08:41,580
Beyond this gravel.

3882
03:08:42,880 --> 03:08:44,180
I've got it all.

3883
03:08:44,780 --> 03:08:45,880
Up here.

3884
03:08:45,980 --> 03:08:46,780
You guys.

3885
03:08:48,780 --> 03:08:49,580
It's fine.

3886
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:51,740
It's fine.

3887
03:08:51,920 --> 03:08:52,560
It's fine.

3888
03:08:55,020 --> 03:08:57,780
No one has ever memorized anything like I have before.

3889
03:08:59,220 --> 03:09:00,840
Why do you have an axe in a cave?

3890
03:09:01,680 --> 03:09:04,360
Why do you have a thought in your brain?

3891
03:09:04,640 --> 03:09:10,220
Because I forgot to put it away.

3892
03:09:19,620 --> 03:09:20,580
Because I forgot to put it away.

3893
03:09:20,580 --> 03:09:21,560
Stop, you guys.

3894
03:09:21,760 --> 03:09:22,000
Stop.

3895
03:09:23,360 --> 03:09:24,920
My health didn't just go down.

3896
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:25,180
Did it?

3897
03:09:25,540 --> 03:09:26,020
No.

3898
03:09:32,790 --> 03:09:34,050
Was there an actual diamond?

3899
03:09:34,870 --> 03:09:35,350
No.

3900
03:09:36,110 --> 03:09:36,910
No diamond.

3901
03:09:40,100 --> 03:09:40,580
Nice.

3902
03:09:40,580 --> 03:09:41,480
You got them good.

3903
03:09:42,460 --> 03:09:42,940
Thanks.

3904
03:09:52,230 --> 03:09:54,330
I'm going to be finishing off these berries right now.

3905
03:09:55,670 --> 03:09:56,150
Probably.

3906
03:09:57,150 --> 03:09:58,770
There was just an eerie noise.

3907
03:10:00,510 --> 03:10:02,130
Diamond in the lower right screen.

3908
03:10:02,890 --> 03:10:03,370
Diamond in the lower right screen.

3909
03:10:09,440 --> 03:10:11,920
Lying isn't very becoming of you.

3910
03:10:22,150 --> 03:10:23,830
Okie dokie.

3911
03:10:24,010 --> 03:10:28,050
The trials are coming in 5...

3912
03:10:30,610 --> 03:10:32,010
4...

3913
03:10:34,290 --> 03:10:35,690
3...

3914
03:10:37,590 --> 03:10:38,990
2...

3915
03:10:40,470 --> 03:10:41,870
1...

3916
03:10:41,870 --> 03:10:42,930
2...

3917
03:10:42,930 --> 03:10:51,270
to the 20 first annual hunger games trials.

3918
03:11:01,290 --> 03:11:02,730
The outlast trials.

3919
03:11:03,550 --> 03:11:08,070
We're trying to outlast whether we can go in this cave without food.

3920
03:11:14,940 --> 03:11:16,120
It's an iron vein.

3921
03:11:16,460 --> 03:11:18,060
Yeah, there's so much iron here.

3922
03:11:18,120 --> 03:11:18,680
It's kind of awesome.

3923
03:11:18,980 --> 03:11:19,740
But it's ok.

3924
03:11:20,540 --> 03:11:21,660
We have one goal.

3925
03:11:23,440 --> 03:11:24,580
Digging through this hole.

3926
03:11:26,700 --> 03:11:28,080
The endurance trials.

3927
03:11:28,240 --> 03:11:29,560
The trial to find.

3928
03:11:32,860 --> 03:11:33,460
This...

3929
03:11:35,660 --> 03:11:36,260
This...

3930
03:11:37,400 --> 03:11:38,000
This...

3931
03:11:39,480 --> 03:11:40,280
One second.

3932
03:11:41,100 --> 03:11:42,240
We got this?

3933
03:11:54,360 --> 03:11:54,960
Guys...

3934
03:11:57,480 --> 03:11:59,420
Guys, I'm really almost out of food.

3935
03:12:01,320 --> 03:12:02,840
Guys, I'm really...

3936
03:12:02,840 --> 03:12:05,060
I just got 2 golden apples.

3937
03:12:06,040 --> 03:12:07,220
Some raw potatoes.

3938
03:12:07,660 --> 03:12:09,180
Will the raw potatoes make me sick?

3939
03:12:09,320 --> 03:12:10,100
That's a bigger question.

3940
03:12:10,800 --> 03:12:13,300
Will the raw potatoes make me sick?

3941
03:12:15,460 --> 03:12:16,480
Will the raw potatoes make me sick?

3942
03:12:16,480 --> 03:12:17,500
Will I die by potato?

3943
03:12:19,940 --> 03:12:20,660
They can?

3944
03:12:21,580 --> 03:12:22,820
Will I hear a zombo?

3945
03:12:23,900 --> 03:12:26,000
Sounds like he is going through his own trial.

3946
03:12:28,280 --> 03:12:30,000
What if this is the trial?

3947
03:12:30,720 --> 03:12:32,300
The trial is...

3948
03:12:33,420 --> 03:12:34,740
The search.

3949
03:12:35,060 --> 03:12:36,660
The exploration.

3950
03:12:37,820 --> 03:12:38,800
The...

3951
03:12:38,800 --> 03:12:40,550
The need for...

3952
03:12:43,120 --> 03:12:45,060
The need for...

3953
03:12:45,060 --> 03:12:46,120
The need for...

3954
03:12:46,120 --> 03:12:46,500
The need for...

3955
03:12:48,300 --> 03:12:49,880
Ok, we're by water.

3956
03:12:51,360 --> 03:12:53,520
The trial is the journey.

3957
03:12:53,980 --> 03:12:55,420
The trial is the journey.

3958
03:12:55,420 --> 03:12:55,940
The lust...

3959
03:12:55,940 --> 03:12:57,240
For...

3960
03:12:58,300 --> 03:12:59,780
Finding something new.

3961
03:13:02,140 --> 03:13:03,420
What if only then...

3962
03:13:03,420 --> 03:13:04,960
Once you accept that fact...

3963
03:13:04,960 --> 03:13:06,680
Will the doors to the trial...

3964
03:13:08,340 --> 03:13:08,780
Ok...

3965
03:13:08,780 --> 03:13:10,120
Open up to you.

3966
03:13:11,920 --> 03:13:12,500
You know?

3967
03:13:14,920 --> 03:13:17,320
The trial is not the friends we made along the way.

3968
03:13:17,420 --> 03:13:19,240
Because we literally have not made any friends.

3969
03:13:23,600 --> 03:13:25,780
I bet the village is probably just like...

3970
03:13:25,780 --> 03:13:28,040
I wonder where that crazy Minto went.

3971
03:13:28,880 --> 03:13:29,760
I bet the village is probably just like...

3972
03:13:29,760 --> 03:13:29,760
I wonder where that crazy Minto went.

3973
03:13:29,780 --> 03:13:31,660
Probably like...

3974
03:13:31,660 --> 03:13:33,080
Damn, I haven't heard from her in a while.

3975
03:13:33,220 --> 03:13:33,840
She's probably dead.

3976
03:13:34,860 --> 03:13:37,040
That guy is probably still sleeping in my bed.

3977
03:13:40,920 --> 03:13:41,800
That alley...

3978
03:13:41,800 --> 03:13:42,460
I set him free!

3979
03:13:43,160 --> 03:13:44,440
I set him free!

3980
03:13:45,040 --> 03:13:46,300
How many times has she died?

3981
03:13:46,400 --> 03:13:46,700
Zero!

3982
03:13:47,380 --> 03:13:49,080
I stream ends once I die!

3983
03:13:49,300 --> 03:13:49,920
What are you talking about?

3984
03:13:54,440 --> 03:13:55,620
I know that there's...

3985
03:13:55,620 --> 03:13:57,480
Lots of noises around me, but...

3986
03:13:57,480 --> 03:13:59,400
What if I just keep digging?

3987
03:14:01,360 --> 03:14:03,840
What if I just keep digging?

3988
03:14:03,840 --> 03:14:05,140
It sounds like a zombie.

3989
03:14:06,440 --> 03:14:08,260
I made a lot of friends in your wisps.

3990
03:14:09,100 --> 03:14:10,740
I made a lot of friends in your wisps.

3991
03:14:10,740 --> 03:14:13,000
It must be so nice to be able to play with people.

3992
03:14:15,620 --> 03:14:17,200
It must be so nice to be able to play with people.

3993
03:14:17,200 --> 03:14:19,080
It must be so nice.

3994
03:14:23,920 --> 03:14:25,440
We're digging away from the zombies.

3995
03:14:27,260 --> 03:14:28,480
Zombie-shaped trial.

3996
03:14:30,980 --> 03:14:32,440
It's not someone behind me, right?

3997
03:14:32,520 --> 03:14:32,920
Ok, good.

3998
03:14:35,160 --> 03:14:36,380
Thank you for watching.

3999
03:14:48,110 --> 03:14:49,930
Make a server with my friends?

4000
03:14:51,050 --> 03:14:51,570
Make a server with my friends?

4001
03:14:51,570 --> 03:14:52,090
Yeah...

4002
03:14:52,650 --> 03:14:54,490
I don't have very many.

4003
03:14:54,910 --> 03:14:55,550
I don't have very many.

4004
03:14:59,090 --> 03:15:01,910
I was trying to put something together for my birthday.

4005
03:15:02,050 --> 03:15:03,250
But I needed like...

4006
03:15:04,430 --> 03:15:06,390
I needed like a team of eight.

4007
03:15:06,770 --> 03:15:08,950
And I was like...

4008
03:15:08,950 --> 03:15:09,610
Oh...

4009
03:15:10,290 --> 03:15:10,810
I...

4010
03:15:11,810 --> 03:15:13,090
I can't come up with eight people.

4011
03:15:13,090 --> 03:15:15,410
I can't come up with eight people.

4012
03:15:20,410 --> 03:15:22,750
And then I cried about it last night.

4013
03:15:23,250 --> 03:15:23,850
And then I cried about it last night.

4014
03:15:28,270 --> 03:15:30,130
And I switched my plans.

4015
03:15:36,310 --> 03:15:37,590
But you know...

4016
03:15:37,590 --> 03:15:40,450
That's just the way the cookie crumbles.

4017
03:15:42,650 --> 03:15:43,950
That's just the way the cookie crumbles.

4018
03:15:46,180 --> 03:15:47,480
Or the blocks...

4019
03:15:47,480 --> 03:15:49,600
That's just the way the Minecraft blocks break.

4020
03:15:54,860 --> 03:15:56,260
Wasn't a seven other person...

4021
03:15:57,140 --> 03:15:57,500
It was different.

4022
03:15:58,360 --> 03:16:00,160
I was only filling in...

4023
03:16:01,480 --> 03:16:03,180
I was only filling in...

4024
03:16:03,180 --> 03:16:04,740
Because Matara couldn't make it.

4025
03:16:10,180 --> 03:16:10,780
Oh...

4026
03:16:14,740 --> 03:16:15,340
Wait...

4027
03:16:15,340 --> 03:16:16,940
Oh my

4028
03:16:22,050 --> 03:16:22,910
god.

4029
03:16:25,870 --> 03:16:28,250
And even a guy riding a damn spider.

4030
03:16:28,470 --> 03:16:28,870
No!

4031
03:16:29,630 --> 03:16:30,890
I won't die here!

4032
03:16:36,130 --> 03:16:36,850
You guys...

4033
03:16:36,850 --> 03:16:37,570
This is so bad.

4034
03:16:38,830 --> 03:16:39,970
Let them in fight.

4035
03:16:40,570 --> 03:16:40,930
Okay.

4036
03:16:42,630 --> 03:16:43,150
Run away.

4037
03:16:43,290 --> 03:16:43,510
Run away.

4038
03:16:43,610 --> 03:16:43,790
Run away.

4039
03:16:43,930 --> 03:16:45,330
I gather them all to one spot.

4040
03:16:45,590 --> 03:16:46,370
And now I run.

4041
03:16:46,690 --> 03:16:47,210
I go.

4042
03:16:47,250 --> 03:16:47,570
I leave.

4043
03:16:50,610 --> 03:16:51,110
We're okay.

4044
03:16:51,330 --> 03:16:51,890
We're fine.

4045
03:16:52,030 --> 03:16:52,410
We're fine.

4046
03:16:52,430 --> 03:16:52,710
We're fine.

4047
03:16:53,490 --> 03:16:54,210
Just keep going.

4048
03:16:54,390 --> 03:16:55,030
Oh my gosh!

4049
03:16:55,110 --> 03:16:56,950
It's my job!

4050
03:16:57,950 --> 03:16:59,230
Exactly what I said would happen.

4051
03:17:27,430 --> 03:17:29,230
This is the world.

4052
03:17:33,110 --> 03:17:33,710
This is the world.

4053
03:17:33,710 --> 03:17:37,610
Where is the world?

4054
03:17:39,250 --> 03:17:40,230
Is this...

4055
03:17:40,230 --> 03:17:41,350
Is this heaven?

4056
03:17:44,770 --> 03:17:46,330
Am I back in heaven?

4057
03:17:55,080 --> 03:17:56,540
Why isn't it loading?

4058
03:17:56,680 --> 03:17:57,020
Hold on.

4059
03:17:57,040 --> 03:17:57,500
Let me try it.

4060
03:17:57,500 --> 03:17:58,100
Save and quit.

4061
03:18:00,120 --> 03:18:01,000
Exploding creepers!

4062
03:18:01,100 --> 03:18:02,300
That's not even what killed me!

4063
03:18:02,400 --> 03:18:03,720
I got killed by a dang skeleton!

4064
03:18:05,960 --> 03:18:06,400
Sad,

4065
03:18:09,820 --> 03:18:10,680
sad, lonely world.

4066
03:18:16,160 --> 03:18:17,860
But I wanna see underworld!

4067
03:18:19,100 --> 03:18:20,300
It won't even let me!

4068
03:18:20,560 --> 03:18:23,180
It won't even let me have the satisfaction of free roaming!

4069
03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:26,680
No!

4070
03:18:39,030 --> 03:18:42,170
Spectator accounts loading chunks should be a setting you can change.

4071
03:18:42,330 --> 03:18:42,690
Spectator accounts loading chunks should be a setting you can change.

4072
03:18:42,690 --> 03:18:43,250
How would I do that?

4073
03:18:48,110 --> 03:18:49,010
Yeeted to heaven.

4074
03:18:49,190 --> 03:18:50,310
I'm in outer heaven!

4075
03:18:52,930 --> 03:18:54,950
We're in outer heaven because...

4076
03:18:54,950 --> 03:18:55,730
We're in outer heaven because...

4077
03:18:55,730 --> 03:18:57,010
We're not...

4078
03:18:57,010 --> 03:18:59,430
This is actually real ghost experience, okay?

4079
03:18:59,630 --> 03:19:01,530
Heaven is up here, right?

4080
03:19:01,530 --> 03:19:03,690
And then this is...

4081
03:19:03,690 --> 03:19:05,150
This is the...

4082
03:19:05,750 --> 03:19:06,530
In between!

4083
03:19:07,450 --> 03:19:08,290
This is the...

4084
03:19:08,790 --> 03:19:09,970
When you're in limbo!

4085
03:19:10,490 --> 03:19:11,710
Snake, what's going on?

4086
03:19:11,930 --> 03:19:12,410
Snake!

4087
03:19:14,450 --> 03:19:16,330
You probably have more friends than you know, Minto.

4088
03:19:18,130 --> 03:19:18,850
I don't know.

4089
03:19:19,410 --> 03:19:20,350
Good one, chief.

4090
03:19:20,570 --> 03:19:21,390
Thanks, Sinbad.

4091
03:19:24,670 --> 03:19:25,150
Purgatory.

4092
03:19:25,710 --> 03:19:26,690
We're in purgatory!

4093
03:19:26,750 --> 03:19:28,170
Why can't I see it for real though?

4094
03:19:29,870 --> 03:19:31,410
Maybe under a video setting?

4095
03:19:31,530 --> 03:19:31,870
Oh.

4096
03:19:33,630 --> 03:19:34,650
Oh.

4097
03:19:35,170 --> 03:19:36,050
Uh...

4098
03:19:37,460 --> 03:19:39,450
Maybe I do more render distance?

4099
03:19:53,650 --> 03:19:54,160
Hmm...

4100
03:19:54,160 --> 03:19:56,460
Alt F4.

4101
03:19:57,910 --> 03:20:00,020
Oh my god...

4102
03:20:00,020 --> 03:20:02,020
Go away...

4103
03:20:02,640 --> 03:20:03,100
What?

4104
03:20:13,340 --> 03:20:15,540
We got the children in the chat.

4105
03:20:20,490 --> 03:20:21,510
Um...

4106
03:20:21,570 --> 03:20:23,230
Yeah, I don't know why it's not loading.

4107
03:20:25,510 --> 03:20:26,710
The Patriots.

4108
03:20:33,350 --> 03:20:34,350
This is...

4109
03:20:34,350 --> 03:20:35,550
What's it called?

4110
03:20:35,730 --> 03:20:38,230
Literally, this is a real Metal Gear moment.

4111
03:20:39,150 --> 03:20:40,610
War never changes.

4112
03:20:45,170 --> 03:20:45,770
Um...

4113
03:20:46,610 --> 03:20:48,610
Game rule to not have spectator load...

4114
03:20:48,610 --> 03:20:49,070
Wait...

4115
03:20:51,570 --> 03:20:51,890
My computer sucks.

4116
03:20:52,030 --> 03:20:52,170
No!

4117
03:20:52,850 --> 03:20:54,270
My computer doesn't suck!

4118
03:20:54,990 --> 03:20:56,030
I have...

4119
03:20:58,330 --> 03:20:58,850
3080!

4120
03:21:06,450 --> 03:21:07,270
It's strong!

4121
03:21:12,690 --> 03:21:13,770
I'm too high up.

4122
03:21:14,190 --> 03:21:14,970
Is that it?

4123
03:21:15,090 --> 03:21:15,490
Really?

4124
03:21:16,370 --> 03:21:17,590
Here I go...

4125
03:21:17,590 --> 03:21:18,910
Wait, what am I at?

4126
03:21:19,130 --> 03:21:20,230
I'm only at 65.

4127
03:21:20,550 --> 03:21:21,350
That's not too high up.

4128
03:21:21,350 --> 03:21:24,250
Unless it's going to show me from where I died.

4129
03:21:24,630 --> 03:21:25,550
Will that load?

4130
03:21:26,530 --> 03:21:27,550
Okay, let's keep going.

4131
03:21:27,650 --> 03:21:28,770
We gotta go down to like...

4132
03:21:28,770 --> 03:21:29,910
Negative 48 or whatever.

4133
03:21:30,950 --> 03:21:31,430
Right?

4134
03:21:32,550 --> 03:21:33,950
Only at 3080?

4135
03:21:34,390 --> 03:21:34,870
What?

4136
03:21:38,150 --> 03:21:39,790
Oh, I think this is where I was at.

4137
03:21:44,290 --> 03:21:47,330
Set your game to survival by opening the game...

4138
03:21:48,130 --> 03:21:49,370
Turning cheats off...

4139
03:21:49,370 --> 03:21:49,610
What?

4140
03:21:50,710 --> 03:21:51,770
That's not true though.

4141
03:21:51,810 --> 03:21:53,490
I've died in hardcore before.

4142
03:21:53,650 --> 03:21:54,750
And it has definitely...

4143
03:21:55,510 --> 03:21:57,810
It has definitely spawned.

4144
03:22:01,330 --> 03:22:02,150
Slash game rule.

4145
03:22:03,330 --> 03:22:04,550
Oh, I don't have the...

4146
03:22:08,590 --> 03:22:09,510
I don't have the...

4147
03:22:09,510 --> 03:22:10,470
I don't have things on.

4148
03:22:11,430 --> 03:22:11,830
Oh.

4149
03:22:23,930 --> 03:22:24,330
Huh.

4150
03:22:25,070 --> 03:22:26,110
I'll put the land first.

4151
03:22:26,350 --> 03:22:26,970
Wait, what does that do?

4152
03:22:27,170 --> 03:22:27,490
Oh!

4153
03:22:27,590 --> 03:22:27,990
Oh!

4154
03:22:28,070 --> 03:22:28,790
Okay, there we go.

4155
03:22:29,470 --> 03:22:30,930
Oh wait, what does that mean?

4156
03:22:31,870 --> 03:22:32,230
What?

4157
03:22:32,310 --> 03:22:32,790
Other players?

4158
03:22:33,050 --> 03:22:34,110
I don't want people to come in.

4159
03:22:36,490 --> 03:22:36,850
What?

4160
03:22:38,490 --> 03:22:39,090
How do I...

4161
03:22:39,090 --> 03:22:39,830
Wait, what is this?

4162
03:22:39,970 --> 03:22:40,590
I'm so confused.

4163
03:22:41,030 --> 03:22:41,750
They can't?

4164
03:22:41,770 --> 03:22:42,030
Okay.

4165
03:22:42,870 --> 03:22:44,330
I think that guy is serious.

4166
03:22:45,710 --> 03:22:46,570
It's local only?

4167
03:22:46,730 --> 03:22:47,510
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

4168
03:22:47,990 --> 03:22:50,050
So if I do spectator...

4169
03:22:50,930 --> 03:22:51,970
And then if I'm like...

4170
03:22:51,970 --> 03:22:53,650
Wait, game mode...

4171
03:22:54,230 --> 03:22:55,790
Wait, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait.

4172
03:22:55,910 --> 03:22:56,270
Wait, oh.

4173
03:22:58,670 --> 03:22:59,690
Don't block me.

4174
03:23:01,510 --> 03:23:03,390
I'm in sad, sad, lonely worlds.

4175
03:23:09,910 --> 03:23:10,730
I give up.

4176
03:23:11,210 --> 03:23:11,950
I give up.

4177
03:23:18,300 --> 03:23:19,020
I give up.

4178
03:23:20,220 --> 03:23:20,960
I give up.

4179
03:23:22,260 --> 03:23:23,460
Minto, don't block Minto.

4180
03:23:25,400 --> 03:23:26,180
I give up.

4181
03:23:26,680 --> 03:23:27,240
It's okay.

4182
03:23:28,260 --> 03:23:29,400
Here, let's just...

4183
03:23:29,400 --> 03:23:30,120
Here, I'll do this.

4184
03:23:30,700 --> 03:23:31,800
Create new world.

4185
03:23:33,740 --> 03:23:35,460
A creative, right?

4186
03:23:35,720 --> 03:23:37,340
Or here, a survival.

4187
03:23:37,560 --> 03:23:39,060
With allow commands on.

4188
03:23:39,360 --> 03:23:40,580
Here, this is what we'll do.

4189
03:23:40,840 --> 03:23:41,660
We'll just pretend.

4190
03:23:42,960 --> 03:23:44,960
Why do I keep starting in the trees?

4191
03:23:46,800 --> 03:23:47,880
Game mode spectator.

4192
03:23:49,020 --> 03:23:50,380
Oh, I just died.

4193
03:23:51,560 --> 03:23:52,600
Oh, oh.

4194
03:23:53,020 --> 03:23:54,280
Look at the world.

4195
03:23:54,500 --> 03:23:54,760
Oh.

4196
03:23:56,900 --> 03:23:57,420
Wow.

4197
03:23:58,600 --> 03:24:00,540
Oh, this could have been us.

4198
03:24:02,360 --> 03:24:03,640
This is where...

4199
03:24:03,640 --> 03:24:04,960
I died probably.

4200
03:24:06,360 --> 03:24:06,960
And...

4201
03:24:07,640 --> 03:24:09,220
This is where I...

4202
03:24:09,940 --> 03:24:10,540
I...

4203
03:24:11,420 --> 03:24:12,540
Wow, it's so beautiful.

4204
03:24:13,400 --> 03:24:14,580
This is where...

4205
03:24:14,580 --> 03:24:15,680
Yeah, there's the hole.

4206
03:24:16,820 --> 03:24:18,040
There's lots of holes.

4207
03:24:18,480 --> 03:24:19,240
Okay, so hold on.

4208
03:24:20,560 --> 03:24:23,100
What's the command to find...

4209
03:24:23,100 --> 03:24:23,640
Wait.

4210
03:24:24,820 --> 03:24:25,420
Biome?

4211
03:24:26,880 --> 03:24:28,960
What's the command to find the...

4212
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:30,600
Locate.

4213
03:24:30,600 --> 03:24:32,060
Biome.

4214
03:24:32,500 --> 03:24:33,400
Um...

4215
03:24:34,600 --> 03:24:35,240
What's it called?

4216
03:24:38,400 --> 03:24:39,580
Oh, structure.

4217
03:24:45,290 --> 03:24:46,900
Cats spawn in.

4218
03:24:49,340 --> 03:24:50,620
Trial chamber.

4219
03:25:04,040 --> 03:25:05,080
Trials edition.

4220
03:25:05,790 --> 03:25:07,300
Step foot in a trial chamber.

4221
03:25:10,540 --> 03:25:10,940
What's...

4222
03:25:10,940 --> 03:25:12,080
Oh, it's just a skelly.

4223
03:25:12,480 --> 03:25:13,660
It's just a skelly.

4224
03:25:13,820 --> 03:25:14,500
And then...

4225
03:25:15,160 --> 03:25:16,400
What the hell is that?

4226
03:25:21,120 --> 03:25:22,060
What is this thing?

4227
03:25:22,220 --> 03:25:22,580
Oh!

4228
03:25:22,940 --> 03:25:24,860
What is that thing?

4229
03:25:28,140 --> 03:25:29,440
I can beat you with my fists.

4230
03:25:30,140 --> 03:25:31,580
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.

4231
03:25:31,580 --> 03:25:32,140
I forgot the skelly.

4232
03:25:34,520 --> 03:25:35,320
Hold on.

4233
03:25:35,440 --> 03:25:36,140
Let's get rid of him.

4234
03:25:40,120 --> 03:25:40,600
Okay.

4235
03:25:42,780 --> 03:25:43,620
Okay, good enough.

4236
03:25:44,700 --> 03:25:46,080
What the heck is this thing?

4237
03:25:46,240 --> 03:25:47,740
Wait, it's like crackling.

4238
03:25:48,800 --> 03:25:49,280
Vault?

4239
03:25:51,480 --> 03:25:52,120
Where'd it go?

4240
03:25:52,960 --> 03:25:53,740
What are these?

4241
03:25:55,260 --> 03:25:55,740
Oh!

4242
03:25:59,630 --> 03:26:00,550
Copper bulbs.

4243
03:26:03,930 --> 03:26:05,210
I'm just gonna explore now.

4244
03:26:06,090 --> 03:26:06,690
Oh, wait.

4245
03:26:08,290 --> 03:26:09,670
We can do creative mode?

4246
03:26:09,810 --> 03:26:10,490
We're powerful.

4247
03:26:10,490 --> 03:26:11,190
What's this thing?

4248
03:26:12,750 --> 03:26:13,370
What's this?

4249
03:26:13,930 --> 03:26:14,710
The vault?

4250
03:26:16,470 --> 03:26:16,930
Ah!

4251
03:26:17,210 --> 03:26:17,670
Oh.

4252
03:26:18,550 --> 03:26:19,150
Oh no!

4253
03:26:19,290 --> 03:26:19,510
Wait!

4254
03:26:20,530 --> 03:26:21,850
I'm supposed to be a survival!

4255
03:26:28,300 --> 03:26:28,980
My bad.

4256
03:26:34,140 --> 03:26:35,200
We'll find another one.

4257
03:26:36,420 --> 03:26:37,620
There's gotta be one around here.

4258
03:26:39,500 --> 03:26:40,400
Trial's my butt.

4259
03:26:40,500 --> 03:26:41,180
There's nothing in here.

4260
03:26:43,480 --> 03:26:45,060
Wow, everything's copper!

4261
03:26:45,320 --> 03:26:46,080
It's so awesome!

4262
03:26:46,840 --> 03:26:47,840
What's down here?

4263
03:26:48,820 --> 03:26:49,820
What's down here?

4264
03:26:51,320 --> 03:26:51,960
Oh!

4265
03:26:52,900 --> 03:26:53,900
Welcome to your doom!

4266
03:26:56,120 --> 03:26:57,400
Wind charge?

4267
03:26:59,280 --> 03:27:00,040
What am I?

4268
03:27:00,120 --> 03:27:00,540
Inuyasha?

4269
03:27:00,760 --> 03:27:01,500
What is this?

4270
03:27:07,510 --> 03:27:08,710
What the heck?

4271
03:27:11,110 --> 03:27:12,190
Break the pots?

4272
03:27:12,830 --> 03:27:13,150
What?

4273
03:27:13,150 --> 03:27:13,630
What a...

4274
03:27:14,750 --> 03:27:15,990
I'm not a maniac.

4275
03:27:20,800 --> 03:27:21,480
Oh!

4276
03:27:21,620 --> 03:27:23,100
It only gave me arrows.

4277
03:27:25,880 --> 03:27:26,560
Wow!

4278
03:27:27,160 --> 03:27:27,840
Wow!

4279
03:27:28,160 --> 03:27:29,120
What's up here?

4280
03:27:30,740 --> 03:27:31,780
Oh wow!

4281
03:27:32,120 --> 03:27:32,340
Wow!

4282
03:27:32,520 --> 03:27:33,440
This place is huge!

4283
03:27:34,040 --> 03:27:34,700
Oh, what's this?

4284
03:27:39,430 --> 03:27:40,110
No!

4285
03:28:01,740 --> 03:28:02,420
Yay!

4286
03:28:02,420 --> 03:28:02,680
Yay!

4287
03:28:04,360 --> 03:28:06,180
I feel like I can delete these, too.

4288
03:28:06,340 --> 03:28:07,600
Did I die in this one?

4289
03:28:09,080 --> 03:28:09,640
Yay!

4290
03:28:26,650 --> 03:28:28,310
This one's survival, though.

4291
03:28:29,030 --> 03:28:31,130
I haven't played it since April.

4292
03:28:35,890 --> 03:28:37,010
Oh, man.

4293
03:28:38,050 --> 03:28:38,870
Delete it.

4294
03:28:38,950 --> 03:28:39,330
Delete.

4295
03:28:40,030 --> 03:28:40,590
Delete.

4296
03:28:41,390 --> 03:28:42,290
What's this one?

4297
03:28:44,290 --> 03:28:44,850
Oh!

4298
03:28:54,810 --> 03:28:55,370
Oh!

4299
03:29:11,070 --> 03:29:13,010
The past rage quit.

4300
03:29:17,190 --> 03:29:18,310
Good stuff.

4301
03:29:18,590 --> 03:29:19,190
Good stuff.

4302
03:29:20,450 --> 03:29:23,330
Well, guys, thank you for joining me for Minecraft today.

4303
03:29:23,670 --> 03:29:24,710
It was a pleasure.

4304
03:29:29,490 --> 03:29:29,970
Thank you.

4305
03:29:30,150 --> 03:29:30,330
Thank you.

4306
03:29:33,930 --> 03:29:37,190
Kind of random, but what's your thought on the short-lived Project KV?

4307
03:29:40,730 --> 03:29:41,130
I...

4308
03:29:43,710 --> 03:29:44,110
Um...

4309
03:29:46,170 --> 03:29:46,570
I...

4310
03:29:47,470 --> 03:29:48,670
Wanted to try it.

4311
03:29:48,710 --> 03:29:48,870
Okay.

4312
03:29:49,150 --> 03:29:49,830
I... Okay.

4313
03:29:49,890 --> 03:29:50,830
There was like some... Okay.

4314
03:29:50,890 --> 03:29:53,970
The reason I wanted to try it was because I heard it was like an age game.

4315
03:29:54,890 --> 03:29:58,450
I think there was... I think there was... Like, that's the first thing I heard about it.

4316
03:29:58,450 --> 03:30:01,990
I was just like, it's Blue Archive, but actually an age game?

4317
03:30:02,270 --> 03:30:03,490
Okay, I want to play it.

4318
03:30:04,810 --> 03:30:07,350
And then I think that was kind of blown out of proportion.

4319
03:30:08,430 --> 03:30:11,150
I think... I think that wasn't actually the case.

4320
03:30:12,190 --> 03:30:12,550
And...

4321
03:30:13,450 --> 03:30:21,410
But then also, I was like, when I saw that it got shut down, I was like, oh, that's kind of sad because I wanted to, you know, I still wanted to try it.

4322
03:30:21,470 --> 03:30:26,270
But then I also heard that, like, Blue Archive was suffering because of it.

4323
03:30:26,270 --> 03:30:30,370
Like, there was some events that were, like, getting repeated and stuff in the JP version.

4324
03:30:30,850 --> 03:30:31,390
And...

4325
03:30:33,650 --> 03:30:34,250
And...

4326
03:30:35,050 --> 03:30:42,070
That... Like, some... Some art and stuff was, like, getting neglected because of it.

4327
03:30:42,250 --> 03:30:43,170
This is so sad.

4328
03:30:43,230 --> 03:30:43,670
Poor Mint.

4329
03:30:44,030 --> 03:30:45,050
I want to play it.

4330
03:30:47,730 --> 03:30:48,930
And so...

4331
03:30:49,770 --> 03:30:50,370
Um...

4332
03:30:52,010 --> 03:30:52,310
Yeah...

4333
03:30:53,870 --> 03:30:56,450
Um... But also...

4334
03:30:57,530 --> 03:30:57,930
Um...

4335
03:30:58,410 --> 03:31:01,510
Blue Archive is, like, more my aesthetic than Red Archive.

4336
03:31:03,690 --> 03:31:13,510
So, you know, I'm more of a fan of Blue Archive and everything anyway, so I probably would have been really sad if it had shut down because of, you know, anything.

4337
03:31:19,060 --> 03:31:20,240
I just like Blue.

4338
03:31:20,420 --> 03:31:21,140
I know, me too.

4339
03:31:22,280 --> 03:31:24,160
Yeah, I like the sci-fi aesthetic a lot too.

4340
03:31:25,120 --> 03:31:27,340
I found so many diamonds on the server.

4341
03:31:27,420 --> 03:31:27,980
10 out of 10.

4342
03:31:30,000 --> 03:31:31,140
RIP Minto server.

4343
03:31:32,500 --> 03:31:33,660
RIP Minto server.

4344
03:31:34,160 --> 03:31:35,520
I'm so sorry, you guys.

4345
03:31:35,540 --> 03:31:36,260
I really did try.

4346
03:31:36,940 --> 03:31:39,360
I really did want to play with you guys, but...

4347
03:31:39,940 --> 03:31:40,820
I'm so sorry.

4348
03:31:45,160 --> 03:31:51,700
And did you know that a recent survey of Blue Archive has a 90 to 10 male-female ratio?

4349
03:31:51,700 --> 03:31:54,760
I don't believe that.

4350
03:31:58,020 --> 03:31:59,140
I don't believe that.

4351
03:32:00,180 --> 03:32:02,320
I think there's a lot of girls that play Blue Archive.

4352
03:32:04,560 --> 03:32:05,440
But also...

4353
03:32:06,420 --> 03:32:06,860
Um...

4354
03:32:07,460 --> 03:32:12,100
I saw that, like, 90% of Blue Archive's revenue comes from, like, JP fans.

4355
03:32:12,340 --> 03:32:16,280
It's like an average of 6,000 yen per person.

4356
03:32:16,880 --> 03:32:17,320
Crazy.

4357
03:32:17,320 --> 03:32:17,480
Crazy.

4358
03:32:21,340 --> 03:32:22,160
Name 10.

4359
03:32:23,160 --> 03:32:23,600
Me?

4360
03:32:25,160 --> 03:32:25,600
Oymo?

4361
03:32:37,760 --> 03:32:38,200
Ringo?

4362
03:32:53,620 --> 03:32:54,320
There's more.

4363
03:32:55,360 --> 03:32:58,640
You guys, I just said that I couldn't name 8 friends for my birthday.

4364
03:32:58,800 --> 03:32:59,680
You gotta do this to me.

4365
03:33:03,700 --> 03:33:05,360
You gotta do this to me!

4366
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:06,760
I can't even name...

4367
03:33:21,980 --> 03:33:22,560
I can't even name 8 friends for my birthday.

4368
03:33:22,560 --> 03:33:24,160
Name every woman Vtuber.

4369
03:33:24,960 --> 03:33:26,280
Starting with the first.

4370
03:33:26,800 --> 03:33:27,900
Annoying Orange?

4371
03:33:32,940 --> 03:33:36,640
But, yeah...

4372
03:33:38,080 --> 03:33:41,060
I don't know if Ayami Sensei actually does play Blue Archive.

4373
03:33:41,240 --> 03:33:43,080
I mean, she draws for Blue Archive.

4374
03:33:43,380 --> 03:33:43,740
Thank you.

4375
03:33:43,900 --> 03:33:44,220
Thank you.

4376
03:33:44,220 --> 03:33:45,640
I don't know if she plays it, you know?

4377
03:33:46,200 --> 03:33:46,700
I don't know if she plays it, you know?

4378
03:33:51,520 --> 03:33:54,700
It's not as simple as you guys think, you know?

4379
03:33:54,760 --> 03:33:58,320
Like, there's time zones and stuff that are in, like, people's schedules.

4380
03:33:58,800 --> 03:33:59,200
So...

4381
03:33:59,740 --> 03:34:00,720
Um, you know...

4382
03:34:02,740 --> 03:34:08,780
It's just that I was trying to, you know... I was trying to find people that could make it in their schedule, is all.

4383
03:34:09,720 --> 03:34:10,120
Okay?

4384
03:34:13,340 --> 03:34:13,740
Jeez.

4385
03:34:14,700 --> 03:34:15,940
Don't have to be so...

4386
03:34:15,940 --> 03:34:16,500
You don't have to...

4387
03:34:16,500 --> 03:34:17,040
You don't have to...

4388
03:34:17,600 --> 03:34:20,400
I'm just joking around and you guys gotta take it so seriously.

4389
03:34:28,090 --> 03:34:29,410
But, you know...

4390
03:34:33,090 --> 03:34:33,570
Jeez.

4391
03:34:34,010 --> 03:34:34,730
Back up.

4392
03:34:35,150 --> 03:34:35,630
Jeez.

4393
03:34:35,710 --> 03:34:36,250
Back up.

4394
03:34:38,290 --> 03:34:38,770
Nah.

4395
03:34:39,630 --> 03:34:40,110
But...

4396
03:34:45,040 --> 03:34:45,520
Nah.

4397
03:34:46,460 --> 03:34:47,520
But, this is fine.

4398
03:34:48,260 --> 03:34:49,080
I'm glad...

4399
03:34:49,080 --> 03:34:52,780
I hope that I can find a trial room for real.

4400
03:34:52,920 --> 03:34:55,100
I understand why you guys said it's dangerous now.

4401
03:34:55,440 --> 03:34:57,340
I need a bow and arrow myself.

4402
03:34:57,600 --> 03:34:58,520
I need more...

4403
03:34:58,940 --> 03:35:00,840
I can fit it in my schedule.

4404
03:35:02,880 --> 03:35:03,840
Oh my gosh.

4405
03:35:03,920 --> 03:35:05,140
JB, thank you!

4406
03:35:05,820 --> 03:35:06,560
Thank you.

4407
03:35:06,580 --> 03:35:08,440
You were the one that I was worried about the most.

4408
03:35:12,720 --> 03:35:13,660
Thank you.

4409
03:35:18,580 --> 03:35:19,060
Thank you.

4410
03:35:22,260 --> 03:35:23,340
Thank you so much.

4411
03:35:23,640 --> 03:35:25,200
Everything is fixed now, you guys.

4412
03:35:25,360 --> 03:35:27,340
The world is back to normal.

4413
03:35:28,480 --> 03:35:29,980
The world is all good.

4414
03:35:30,280 --> 03:35:32,500
The world is good again.

4415
03:35:34,220 --> 03:35:36,780
Alrighty, I'm gonna end today's stream here.

4416
03:35:37,480 --> 03:35:38,520
This is fun.

4417
03:35:41,300 --> 03:35:44,960
I'm so sorry to everybody again who wanted to play.

4418
03:35:44,960 --> 03:35:49,500
And especially if you were like, oh, I'm gonna put it in my schedule to try and play.

4419
03:35:50,540 --> 03:35:51,440
I'm so sorry.

4420
03:35:51,580 --> 03:35:52,240
I really am.

4421
03:35:55,080 --> 03:35:59,700
And hopefully next time I can get it to work and get some people to help me.

4422
03:35:59,780 --> 03:36:04,300
And not just be like a silly goose uber about it and be like, hee hee, I'm just gonna do this on my own.

4423
03:36:05,300 --> 03:36:06,100
And yeah.

4424
03:36:08,440 --> 03:36:10,220
But yeah, thank you guys.

4425
03:36:10,420 --> 03:36:11,360
One day we'll play.

4426
03:36:11,480 --> 03:36:12,200
One day we'll play.

4427
03:36:12,320 --> 03:36:13,280
I'll make sure of it.

4428
03:36:14,960 --> 03:36:15,660
I will make it happen.

4429
03:36:16,680 --> 03:36:17,860
I will make it happen.

4430
03:36:19,340 --> 03:36:19,940
Yes, yes.

4431
03:36:20,420 --> 03:36:21,160
Yes, yes, yes.

4432
03:36:21,680 --> 03:36:23,140
So there will be a revengeance.

4433
03:36:23,160 --> 03:36:24,880
Don't think that this will be the only time.

4434
03:36:25,500 --> 03:36:26,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4435
03:36:26,780 --> 03:36:28,960
Don't think that it'll be the only time.

4436
03:36:31,460 --> 03:36:35,240
But thank you guys for hanging out with me these past couple of hours.

4437
03:36:35,360 --> 03:36:35,900
It was fun.

4438
03:36:36,120 --> 03:36:41,180
It was good to come back to Minecraft and be just a little dumb about it and everything.

4439
03:36:42,940 --> 03:36:43,720
So, hmm.

4440
03:36:44,960 --> 03:36:45,600
Okie dokie.

4441
03:36:47,720 --> 03:36:48,160
Otomita!

4442
03:36:49,020 --> 03:36:49,920
Otomita, Otomita!

4443
03:36:50,140 --> 03:36:51,260
Thanks for meeting Minecraft!

4444
03:36:51,920 --> 03:36:53,760
And I'll see you guys later.

4445
03:36:54,480 --> 03:36:54,920
Bye bye!

4446
03:36:55,740 --> 03:36:56,180
Otomita!

4447
03:36:56,660 --> 03:36:57,440
See you!

4448
03:36:57,500 --> 03:36:58,560
See you, see you, see you!

4449
03:36:58,740 --> 03:36:59,800
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4450
03:37:00,060 --> 03:37:00,420
Wait.

4451
03:37:00,700 --> 03:37:01,960
Let's see if we can raid somebody.

4452
03:37:02,760 --> 03:37:03,320
Let's see.

4453
03:37:05,120 --> 03:37:06,180
Is there anybody here?

4454
03:37:10,640 --> 03:37:11,080
What?

4455
03:37:11,780 --> 03:37:12,920
Let me raid Kiara?

4456
03:37:13,520 --> 03:37:13,960
What?

4457
03:37:14,260 --> 03:37:14,920
Let me raid Kiara?

4458
03:37:14,920 --> 03:37:16,500
Let me raid her, I wonder.

4459
03:37:17,980 --> 03:37:18,420
Ok!

4460
03:37:18,660 --> 03:37:19,720
We'll raid Kiwawa!

4461
03:37:21,060 --> 03:37:21,500
Ok!

4462
03:37:21,500 --> 03:37:22,200
Bye bye!

4463
03:37:22,540 --> 03:37:23,680
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye!

4464
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:25,740
See you, see you, see you, see you!

4465
03:37:26,360 --> 03:37:27,040
Bye bye!
