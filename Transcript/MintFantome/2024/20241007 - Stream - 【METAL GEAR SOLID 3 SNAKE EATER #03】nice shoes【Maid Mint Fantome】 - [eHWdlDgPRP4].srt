00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,300
Hello everybody, okaeri na saimasen!

2
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,580
Goshijin-sama, ojou-sama!

3
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,580
Hold on, I gotta do something.

4
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,780
I've been wanting to do this.

5
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,940
And now I have.

6
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,160
Hold on, I remember.

7
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,120
Okay, 3, 2, 1!

8
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,750
Classic.

9
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,450
Oh my goodness.

10
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,410
Classic.

11
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,650
Classic, classic.

12
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,750
There we go.

13
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,670
Welcome back to Metal Gear Solid 3.

14
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,450
Snake Eater.

15
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,940
For those asking about memory cards, yes, I found another one.

16
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,940
So we're all good.

17
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,520
I put it in and switched it.

18
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,440
Thank you so much for using my art for the thumbnail today!

19
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
And on the first Snake Eater stream means a ton!

20
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,400
Of course!

21
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,740
God!

22
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,140
Oh my gosh, thank you!

23
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,520
It's so awesome!

24
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,280
Thank you!

25
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,240
I'm...

26
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,300
Whoa!

27
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:23,300
What a fear in my heart But your soul's supreme But I'm alive Not for

28
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:40,540
real In my time There'll be no one Will we get Sneder today?

29
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:40,960
I wonder.

30
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,420
Oh my gosh you guys, my voice is really dead today.

31
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:34,660
I love these little guys, these little parachute guys.

32
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
I come back.

33
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,980
Parachute.

34
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,320
Parachute guys.

35
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,060
Parachute.

36
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:48,990
Parachute.

37
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,470
OMG she's playing Delta.

38
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,030
So true.

39
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:06,550
Oh my god.

40
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,770
Bam.

41
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,170
Damn it.

42
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,050
No Sneder today.

43
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,430
Yippee!

44
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,800
Oh yes.

45
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,160
Welcome back to Metal Gear Solid 3.

46
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,600
Subsistence.

47
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,520
Yeah.

48
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,720
Bye bye Metal Gear Solid 4.

49
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,620
Last time we ended off right before the end fight.

50
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,240
Not the last fight.

51
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:04,100
Not to be confused with the final fight, but the fight with the boss known as the end.

52
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,990
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not feeling super hot today.

53
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,350
I'm feeling a little under the weather.

54
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,270
So I'm not sure how long I'll play.

55
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,030
Since yesterday I started feeling a little bit icky.

56
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,310
But I don't know.

57
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,070
I might get into it and I might just kinda go for it.

58
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,630
Oh, do you guys want some coffee can ASMR?

59
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:36,550
Here we go.

60
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,330
Here we go.

61
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,430
Wow, that one is actually pretty clean.

62
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,430
Yeah, I think I've just been kinda overworking myself a little bit.

63
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,070
Yeah, I have a stomach ache.

64
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:54,270
That was smooth.

65
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,170
That was crisp.

66
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,250
That was so good.

67
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,170
I'm shocked.

68
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,830
Usually that always is like all over me.

69
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,250
Usually.

70
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,550
But... and I tested this earlier.

71
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,670
Ready?

72
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:17,010
My save... I transferred it over to a new card.

73
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,730
So we should have no problems.

74
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,810
We should be okay.

75
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,370
We should be good.

76
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,310
We should be alright.

77
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:29,610
Um...

78
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,510
Yeah.

79
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

80
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:34,490
Nice.

81
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,850
Yeah, so...

82
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,310
Like I said, we're at the end.

83
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,390
Not at the... of the...

84
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:43,850
The game.

85
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,010
Sorry, I thought I heard my cat.

86
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,470
I think it was something outside.

87
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,370
Um...

88
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,490
I don't know.

89
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,190
I don't think it's from last night.

90
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,030
I mean, last night definitely didn't help.

91
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,930
For those who don't know, I had a concert.

92
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,730
Like on an aircraft carrier last night.

93
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:04,410
But...

94
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,450
My voice was even feeling bad before then.

95
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,710
So I think I've just got a little cold, you know.

96
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,550
I think I've got a little cold is all.

97
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,430
So...

98
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,330
Um, yeah.

99
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:16,390
Yeah.

100
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,250
The USS Hornet.

101
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:18,490
Yeah!

102
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

103
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,670
Saturday on a Minecraft carrier.

104
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,990
Sunday playing MGS3.

105
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,350
It's a military weekend.

106
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,010
Yes, baby!

107
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,850
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,410
Um...

109
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:33,770
Hmm.

110
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,390
What else was I gonna say?

111
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,130
It's a video of the One Piece song.

112
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,590
Yeah!

113
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,590
Wait, did I say Minecraft?

114
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,790
Oh, I meant aircraft.

115
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,390
Wait, did I say Minecraft?

116
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,730
No way.

117
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,730
Did I say Minecraft?

118
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,130
Oh my god.

119
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,110
Is

120
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,120
it today?

121
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,980
Oh my god.

122
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,360
No way.

123
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:07,940
Wait.

124
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,620
Did I actually?

125
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,980
Did I actually say Minecraft?

126
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,960
Aircraft carrier.

127
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,360
Sorry.

128
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,040
Anything with blank craft.

129
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,080
My mind automatically is gonna say Minecraft.

130
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,600
Okay.

131
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,740
Oh, gosh!

132
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,460
Okay.

133
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,380
So yeah.

134
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,820
Let's get into it.

135
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,660
So I don't know.

136
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,120
Like I said, I'm not sure how long I'll play.

137
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,460
Any VOD watchers?

138
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:36,980
Hello, hello.

139
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,580
You will know how long I played.

140
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,620
Looking cute in your green tent.

141
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,280
Thank you.

142
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,720
It's very MGS1.

143
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,200
But, you know, it still works, I feel.

144
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,720
Concert on aircraft carrier.

145
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,060
Minto is a true warrior.

146
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,200
So yeah.

147
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:55,540
Oh!

148
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,880
Snake, are you there?

149
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,300
Eva.

150
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:01,700
Eva.

151
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,760
Where are you?

152
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,840
In the fortress.

153
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,960
In Groznygrad.

154
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,640
Groznygrad.

155
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,600
Dr. Sokolov is here too.

156
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,320
Groznygrad.

157
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,720
Is he alright?

158
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,040
He's fine.

159
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,440
Right now he's busy putting the finishing touches on the shagglehod.

160
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:12,940
No.

161
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,240
Good.

162
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,260
That means they haven't killed him.

163
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,660
Not yet, Minto.

164
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,160
Sorry for my voice.

165
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,120
They've already finished the phase 2 tests.

166
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,440
Oh no.

167
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,920
Oh no.

168
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,040
Oh no.

169
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,020
Sokolov's preparations are complete.

170
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,160
They'll have no more use for him.

171
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,060
The colonel won't have any qualms about killing him if he thinks the CIA is closing in.

172
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
Eva, you can't let Sokolov out of your sight.

173
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,100
I know.

174
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,640
Snake, do you know where Groznygrad is?

175
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,820
What's your favorite picture of Eva?

176
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,540
Granon told me that I should be able to get there from the mountains to the north through an underground tunnel.

177
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,000
That one's pretty nice.

178
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,040
Granon told you?

179
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:44,840
Yeah.

180
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,920
He even gave me the key to the warehouse.

181
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Yeah, I just went through.

182
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,460
Four.

183
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,380
One.

184
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,860
You've gotta be kidding me.

185
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,040
Four.

186
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,460
You've gotta be kidding me.

187
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,220
Hell if I know.

188
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,160
That's side profile.

189
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,080
Snake, there's one problem with that route.

190
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,320
Five.

191
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,300
What problem?

192
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,620
The mountain entrance to the underground tunnel that leads to the fortress is sealed.

193
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,260
You need a key to get in.

194
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:03,580
Oh.

195
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,200
A key?

196
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,680
What about the key Granon gave me?

197
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,160
That key won't work.

198
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,720
Why not?

199
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,560
But don't worry.

200
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,440
I'll figure something out.

201
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,260
Why does she say it like that?

202
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,340
That key won't work.

203
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,500
I have an idea.

204
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:14,880
Okay.

205
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,480
There are some ruins at the top of the mountains.

206
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,520
Meet me there.

207
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:18,860
Ruins.

208
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,120
The top of the mountains.

209
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,000
Got it.

210
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,020
Ruins.

211
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,800
Wait.

212
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,740
It's like my least favorite area.

213
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,440
I'm gonna be honest.

214
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,000
Now what?

215
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,480
I heard that one of the cobras is waiting for you in the jungle at the foot of the mountains.

216
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,480
The jungle?

217
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,780
He's a legendary sniper called The End.

218
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,560
The End.

219
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:34,940
Yeah.

220
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,340
I've seen him before.

221
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,780
That ridiculously old guy, right?

222
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,640
Don't underestimate him.

223
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,560
He's so old.

224
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,920
He's known as the father of modern sniping.

225
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,420
Oh my god.

226
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,220
Is he alone?

227
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,540
No spotter?

228
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,340
None.

229
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,840
He's all by himself.

230
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,760
He's got the bird.

231
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,540
Apparently, he doesn't need a spotter.

232
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,020
The bird is here.

233
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,740
The bird is his spotter.

234
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,160
He can't be serious.

235
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,880
The entire forest is on his side.

236
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,920
The forest?

237
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,680
Stay alert.

238
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,720
One with the snow white.

239
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,200
Yeah.

240
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,820
I'd hate to have it be the End for me.

241
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,440
Ha ha ha ha ha.

242
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,040
Yeah.

243
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,940
Honestly, I don't remember how to do the End fight at all.

244
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,020
Oh my goodness.

245
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:16,940
Hold on.

246
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,300
All my food is bad, isn't it?

247
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,640
Call Eva back to have an argument.

248
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:20,740
Argument.

249
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,360
Argument!

250
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:33,050
The name of that forest is Svyatogorni, in Russian it means something like the sacred mountain path.

251
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:41,330
The name comes from an old folk tale about mountain spirits who passed through there on their way to Sokrovieno, the forest to the north.

252
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,570
Head north and you'll come to Sokrovieno.

253
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,970
The tunnel that leads to the mountains is in the northern area of Sokrovieno.

254
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,350
I'll meet you in the ruins at the top of the mountains.

255
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:52,870
Okay.

256
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,950
I'll give you the key to the tunnel leading to Groznygrad when you get there.

257
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,190
Okay.

258
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,190
Remember, go north.

259
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:58,710
Go north.

260
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,170
But Sokrovieno is also where...

261
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:01,530
I know.

262
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,010
The end, right?

263
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:04,790
Yeah.

264
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,670
Why did it say, like, suddenly got so, like, serious?

265
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,810
The end is waiting for you in Sokrovieno.

266
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,890
He's a legendary sniper.

267
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:13,950
The end.

268
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,990
Until you defeat him in battle...

269
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,250
I won't be able to move on.

270
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,230
Right.

271
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,290
Then I'll just have to beat him.

272
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,830
I guess you will.

273
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,850
That wasn't a fight.

274
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,830
Let me try again.

275
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,590
Eva.

276
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,390
What?

277
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,770
I couldn't get a hold of you for a while there.

278
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,010
What were you doing?

279
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:32,510
Oh, yeah.

280
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,950
What do you think I was doing?

281
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,930
That's what I'm asking you.

282
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,210
Yeah.

283
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,890
Why are you asking me that?

284
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,590
Because I want to know.

285
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,070
That's why.

286
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,410
Want to know what?

287
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,370
Will you stop answering my questions with questions?

288
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,730
Are you mad?

289
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,290
See ya.

290
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,190
See ya.

291
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,310
See ya.

292
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,710
What are you mad about, huh?

293
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,630
What are you mad about?

294
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,830
Snake, have you been contacted by Eva?

295
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,470
Maybe.

296
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,850
Yeah.

297
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,790
She said we'd meet up in the ruins at the top of the mountains.

298
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,610
She also said she picked up the key to get into the tunnel that leads to Krasnograd.

299
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:10,850
Yes.

300
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,830
Have you...

301
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,450
Good.

302
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,170
Hurry to the rendezvous with Eva.

303
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,150
Head for the mountains.

304
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:17,950
Proceed north through the woods.

305
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,910
If you have your...

306
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,450
Sorry.

307
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,310
I don't know why I waited.

308
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,210
I thought he was done.

309
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,270
If you have your...

310
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:22,290
If you have your...

311
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,190
Climb up the shaft and you'll come out of the mountains.

312
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,870
I don't know why I waited to keep talking until he started talking again.

313
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,990
Head north.

314
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:27,990
I'm on it.

315
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,490
But stay on your toes.

316
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:29,950
My toes.

317
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,170
Isn't the Cobra Unit's sniper lying in wait for you?

318
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,190
If you wait a week...

319
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:36,770
Yeah.

320
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,470
But there's no other way.

321
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:37,970
The end will die.

322
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:38,390
Yes.

323
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,250
Your obsession...

324
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:39,850
Watch yourself.

325
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,890
Your opponent is a legendary sniper.

326
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,370
Your fight with the end will likely be a long and grueling one.

327
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,110
Your obsession...

328
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,110
You should stock up on battle necessities like ammunition and provisions now while you still can.

329
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,130
No.

330
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:52,190
No.

331
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,210
No.

332
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:52,450
I gotta get a gun.

333
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:52,550
OK.

334
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,570
Thank you, guys.

335
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,890
Boss it's my friend Kay's birthday.

336
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,850
They are a huge fan of yours cause you wished him a happy birthday.

337
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,890
Of course.

338
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,910
Kay, happy birthday!

339
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,710
Happy birthday to you.

340
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,050
Happy birthday to you.

341
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,710
Happy birthday dear Kay.

342
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,550
Happy birthday to you.

343
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,270
Happy birthday dear Kay.

344
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:23,810
Happy birthday!

345
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,990
Sorry, my voice is a little squeaky today.

346
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,930
Mint, can you help me out?

347
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,370
My 4-year-old daughter loves your streams but she is struggling to count backwards from 10 to 0.

348
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,450
Can you show her how it's done like a boss?

349
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,210
10... 9... wait, okay.

350
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,670
I have to... okay.

351
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,310
We gotta make this like a kid's show.

352
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,330
Wait, no.

353
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,030
What do you mean no?

354
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,770
Not this way.

355
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,510
Where's the trap?

356
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:51,750
No?

357
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,510
Wait, what's wrong?

358
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,340
Just... don't?

359
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,150
3... 3...

360
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,930
Is it the hawk thing again?

361
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,370
I don't know.

362
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,970
Go away!

363
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,330
Getting your daughter involved in this nonsense.

364
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,580
Boss, can you say you maybe don't hate us?

365
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,320
I'm not taking any more bait.

366
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,940
I'm not taking any more bait.

367
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,640
I'm not taking any more bait, okay?

368
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,540
Gosh.

369
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,800
I don't get it.

370
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,000
I don't know either.

371
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,660
My food is all...

372
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,980
Look, I have... oh no!

373
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,100
My glow caps!

374
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,700
No!

375
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,400
At least all my...

376
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,780
Oh, my rabbit.

377
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,680
We didn't even get to eat it.

378
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,700
Oh, I should have eaten them.

379
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,840
Alright, let's throw it out.

380
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh...

381
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,960
My false mango!

382
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,300
What a waste.

383
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,800
We got a lot of food, but... you know.

384
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,500
Yeah.

385
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,440
I don't think there's guys around this area, but let's get some more...

386
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:48,960
Oh, what's this?

387
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,480
A book.

388
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:52,960
Let's see.

389
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,480
What can we...

390
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,220
There's something down...

391
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,980
Oh, I think that's a frog.

392
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh!

393
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,440
Oh!

394
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,260
Oops.

395
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,720
Knife.

396
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,140
Knife.

397
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:05,820
Knife.

398
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,100
Get that frog!

399
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,320
Get that frog snake!

400
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,420
Get that...

401
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,920
I'm cutting the grass again.

402
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,060
Get that frog.

403
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,260
Oh, there it is.

404
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,060
I got the frog.

405
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,240
Maybe I should have...

406
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,020
They would have...

407
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,240
They wouldn't eat that, right?

408
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,760
They wouldn't have eaten that, right?

409
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,820
This is a good spot to catch a tsuchinoko.

410
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,440
We don't have to do that today since it's very RNG heavy.

411
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,000
Wait, actually, right here?

412
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,360
Some areas to explore before you go straight north if you want.

413
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,000
Might be a missable weapon.

414
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,300
Good to know.

415
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,440
Thank you.

416
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,040
There's a bunny!

417
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,780
Come here.

418
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,460
Come here.

419
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,220
This is my snack.

420
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,740
Sorry, bunny.

421
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,120
Guys, this is my snack.

422
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,980
Also, they have serum for some reason.

423
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,580
I don't quite understand why, but...

424
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,640
Guys, I need that.

425
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,880
Guys, I need that.

426
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,040
Guys, I need that.

427
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,560
It's the poop?

428
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,060
Wait, what's up there?

429
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,050
What's up here?

430
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,750
Oh, I can maybe get some...

431
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,570
fruit?

432
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,430
Or...

433
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,370
Where is Kerotan, I wonder?

434
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,560
Waka, waka, waka, waka, waka.

435
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,880
Have fun against the la- Wait, why did that change?

436
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,600
We're not there yet!

437
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,820
We're not there yet!

438
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,550
I think we can just keep going.

439
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,350
What the?

440
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,870
Did I just hear something hiss at me?

441
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,050
Stop!

442
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,050
Maybe I should...

443
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:18,410
Hold on.

444
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:19,930
We'll take this guy.

445
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,000
Oh!

446
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,820
There we go.

447
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,240
Ok, now we got the snake D.

448
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,360
We got the snake D.

449
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,440
It's in my backpack?

450
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,160
Where do you put these guys?

451
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,270
Oh!

452
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,770
Coral Snake!

453
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,910
Yeah...

454
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,790
...

455
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,670
I got the snake D.

456
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,850
A live coral snake.

457
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,870
Will he die in there next week if I don't use him?

458
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,930
What's a ghost's favorite drink?

459
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,290
Booba tea.

460
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,090
Actually,

461
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,170
I'll hold on to it.

462
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,220
Are these berries?

463
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,690
Sea med.

464
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,530
Oh, cold medicine.

465
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,310
What else is in... is there anything else to explore?

466
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,390
Oh, more medicine.

467
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,550
Oh, splint?

468
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,070
What?

469
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,470
Huh?

470
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,010
How?

471
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:44,990
Okay.

472
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,850
There's a bunny up there.

473
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:50,590
Snack.

474
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,790
A snack, a snack.

475
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,080
Hello, I'm late.

476
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,480
You're...

477
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,020
Who was that?

478
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,080
You're not late at all.

479
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,660
I just got started.

480
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,160
What's this?

481
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,140
Disinfectant?

482
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,900
Gosh, I need all this stuff, don't I?

483
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,820
Especially right before... this battle.

484
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,760
This fight.

485
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,380
I know for Delta, in the bottom left corner, there's a...

486
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,760
There's a... what's it called?

487
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,740
A compass now.

488
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,820
So, we'll have a compass.

489
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,260
For any...

490
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,200
When they're like, go north, and you're like...

491
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,140
What is north?

492
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,720
Which is me.

493
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,880
I have a little issue with directions sometimes.

494
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,990
Do I want the blablokos or... Nah, I don't need a blabloko.

495
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,330
I think we're okay.

496
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,590
What do you mean, we know?

497
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,410
Stop it, Snack.

498
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:12,730
West.

499
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,210
I don't remember when it starts, the fight, you know?

500
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,730
I don't remember when he goes heavy, yo.

501
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,310
I don't know when is exactly the beginning.

502
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,170
I can't remember.

503
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,050
A couple areas before then?

504
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:42,530
Oh, okay.

505
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,230
Are there guys around?

506
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,650
Or are we pretty safe?

507
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,890
I wonder.

508
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,950
Just update my...

509
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,730
My uniform.

510
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,650
Baby corn thinks he's the captain!

511
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,130
Five guys.

512
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,670
Oh, I don't need to change it.

513
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,070
Okay, cool.

514
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,710
There's guys before the end.

515
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,370
Why are there always guys, man?

516
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,470
Why are there always guys?

517
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,030
There we go.

518
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,190
I was like, wait a second, that's not my...

519
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,550
Some moments like this.

520
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,870
I wish I could crouch walk.

521
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,050
I see a beehive.

522
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,630
Is that a beehive or is that a blabloko?

523
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,300
That's a beehive.

524
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,240
I can hear him buzzing.

525
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,860
Where are the guys at?

526
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,460
What's...

527
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,940
Is that a guy?

528
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,760
In there?

529
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,010
I don't think so.

530
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,990
Wow, actually the original camera angle kind of helped here.

531
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,070
Let's see how the original camera angle is throughout this.

532
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,870
Oh, never mind, I hate it.

533
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,430
Okay.

534
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,270
He's like...

535
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,090
Thermal?

536
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,170
Oh, yeah.

537
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:19,710
Sorry,

538
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,860
I gotta get back into the groove of things, guys.

539
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,520
I gotta get back into the groove of things.

540
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,500
Why is that spot so warm?

541
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,060
Is that a trap?

542
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,800
I hear footsteps somewhere.

543
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,440
Oh!

544
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,440
There he is.

545
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,240
Oh my gosh.

546
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,360
Oh my gosh.

547
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,380
Oh why'd you have to like go behind the tree huh.

548
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,670
Is he coming this way?

549
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,580
Oh my gosh please.

550
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,600
I got him.

551
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,000
No worries.

552
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,100
Anyone else?

553
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,700
Sorry for your eyes?

554
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:19,860
Everybody?

555
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,640
What if I put him in the mud?

556
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,540
What if I put him in the mud?

557
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,780
Oh I see him.

558
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,070
Where is he?

559
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,990
Where'd he go?

560
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,990
Mister.

561
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,370
Oh mister.

562
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,750
Oh no that's not what I was doing.

563
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,700
Disappeared.

564
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,320
Hmm.

565
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,860
Let's go to leaf.

566
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,780
I'm just a leaf.

567
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,360
I'm just a leaf.

568
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,120
Where the hell did that guy go?

569
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,060
What?

570
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,840
He disappeared from my sight!

571
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,860
Back to the tires.

572
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,380
Oh wait I hear him.

573
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,640
Somewhere?

574
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,120
Oh gosh I thought I saw him.

575
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,680
Where the hell is he?

576
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,100
You know what let's just...

577
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,940
He sounds behind.

578
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,860
Guys am I blind?

579
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,760
Am I blind?

580
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,300
I don't know.

581
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,290
I don't even know where I need to be going.

582
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,230
I don't remember this area.

583
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,370
I'll...

584
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,110
Oh!

585
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:36,460
Oh I think...

586
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,980
This... Is it up there?

587
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,500
I guess I could like go around the area and kind of...

588
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,150
Sorry for your eyes.

589
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:50,830
I'm so sorry.

590
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,450
So sorry... Oh my gosh.

591
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,940
Why'd he have to go?

592
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,420
Heck!

593
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,470
I think there's two of them though.

594
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,330
I hear another one.

595
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,410
My sensitive ears.

596
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,980
I hear someone up there.

597
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,920
The sonar in this game...

598
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,860
I don't know.

599
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,860
I don't like it very much.

600
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,160
Can I climb up that?

601
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,320
No.

602
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,610
Oh my god!

603
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:45,970
Oh!

604
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,330
Turn around Snake.

605
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,350
Where'd he go?

606
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,090
Oh there's his ass.

607
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,070
Get his ass.

608
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,300
I mean shoot but like...

609
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,100
Get him.

610
00:30:59,180 --> 00:30:59,560
Oh my gosh.

611
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,900
He's like looking right at me.

612
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,220
Is there anyone else?

613
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:10,950
I hear a buzzing.

614
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,070
I hear some bees I think.

615
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,870
Go up Snake.

616
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,830
Hide in this little cubby.

617
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,180
Turn around.

618
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,760
Turn around.

619
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,160
There we go.

620
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,440
Nice.

621
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,660
Anybody else?

622
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,480
We're so stealthy you guys.

623
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,460
I'm literally a snake right now.

624
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,200
I'm an actual snake.

625
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,860
Either the sonar is useless...

626
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,540
Or...

627
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,920
We're good for now.

628
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,790
Hmm.

629
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,730
Answer

630
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,560
me.

631
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,000
He's my kid.

632
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,640
No!

633
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,080
You suck!

634
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,380
You suck!

635
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,480
Oh my gosh.

636
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,640
Oh my gosh.

637
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,760
I didn't even see it.

638
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,920
You suck!

639
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,920
I didn't even see it.

640
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,400
We're so blocked.

641
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,380
You suck man.

642
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,000
Good job sir.

643
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,280
Thank you so much for the 50.

644
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,820
Thank you.

645
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,420
Oh wow.

646
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,320
That was so silly!

647
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,000
That was so silly!

648
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,100
That was

649
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:07,770
so silly!

650
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,190
Oh, I think

651
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,670
it's a frog, whatever's in there.

652
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,430
Alright, let's climb up this tree maybe.

653
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,510
Maybe if I climb up the tree...

654
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,110
I can get a vantage point, right?

655
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,350
And not... Oh, I see it now!

656
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,510
Come on, it's so rude.

657
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,810
We were ready for the end, but not the pit.

658
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,270
It's so rude.

659
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,530
It's so rude.

660
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,570
Alright, I'm gonna have to turn my thermals back on.

661
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,350
I'm sorry, everybody.

662
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,910
Actually, can I even get... Oh, here.

663
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,630
He's right there.

664
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,880
Yeah, that's right.

665
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,600
And, uh...

666
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,480
The other guy is...

667
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,040
I don't think I can see him from here.

668
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,120
Anybody?

669
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,020
No, I didn't kill him!

670
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,000
What do you think I am?

671
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,040
I'm no monster.

672
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,800
My river's gonna be so clean.

673
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,380
Okay.

674
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:39,600
Alright.

675
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,680
Easy.

676
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,320
Easy.

677
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,480
Easy.

678
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,200
Easy.

679
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:48,900
Oh, nope.

680
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,380
Grab ya.

681
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,120
Missed the start of the stream.

682
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,220
Sorry to keep you waiting.

683
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,520
Well, welcome in.

684
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,120
Welcome in.

685
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,280
What was it?

686
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,900
Oh, sonar.

687
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,040
Oh, I forgot to press L3.

688
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,560
I also...

689
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,740
Don't think I understand how it works.

690
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,640
Hmm.

691
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,620
Anyway...

692
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,600
Thermal Goggles is pretty good.

693
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,460
I don't hear anybody, so...

694
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,000
Sorry, I'm a little slow today.

695
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,860
Like I said, I'm feeling a little tired and under the weather and everything.

696
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,760
Oh, there he is.

697
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:46,980
Oh my god, wait.

698
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,820
I don't want that on.

699
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,220
No.

700
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,000
Thank you.

701
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,440
Where is he?

702
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,360
Wait, where?

703
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,800
Thank ya!

704
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,360
Is it just these two guys?

705
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,420
Tempest!

706
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,480
Thanks for the vibe, Grifton!

707
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,920
Thank you so much!

708
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,540
Is there anything else in this area?

709
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,400
Besides, like...

710
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,980
Anything else?

711
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,320
I think it's...

712
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,360
Yeah, it's this way.

713
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:32,180
First time... Dono here wanted to tell you I saw your last MGS3 stream.

714
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,940
And remember, I hadn't played Metal Gear before.

715
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,040
But it was...

716
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,160
I bought the whole series and now I'm on MGS2.

717
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,160
Professor!

718
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,940
Oh my gosh, thank you!

719
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,220
It says it's your first time, Dono, but then it says it's your first Super Chat.

720
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,260
I mean, your third.

721
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Which is it?

722
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,340
Which is it?

723
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:57,940
But yes.

724
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,000
Metal Gear... MGS2 is...

725
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,840
So good.

726
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,340
So, so good.

727
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,820
I guess we're good.

728
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,980
Look at my... Wait, what's that?

729
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,300
Oh, Mushroom.

730
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,680
Oh, first time donating to me.

731
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,200
Oh, I thought it always meant like...

732
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,440
Like that's your first or your third ever... like on the channel.

733
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,540
I didn't realize it was ever.

734
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,960
Sorry, I didn't mean to doubt you.

735
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,720
I was just confused.

736
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,200
Why can't I get the Mushroom?

737
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,040
Yeah, have fun with it.

738
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,180
Why can't I get it?

739
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,460
Why can't I get it?

740
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,620
I give up.

741
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,960
Gosh, it scared me.

742
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,040
Mushroom.

743
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,360
Grabbable Mushroom.

744
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,740
Never mind.

745
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,220
Wait.

746
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,080
Stop getting up, Snake.

747
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,860
I want to get that.

748
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,740
There we go.

749
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,900
We need snacks.

750
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:22,640
We need snacks.

751
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,440
Oh my gosh, that guy right there scared the heck out of me.

752
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,340
I think I got him.

753
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,560
There we go.

754
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,180
Oh no.

755
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,100
What do you mean, what's wrong?

756
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,160
Who else is there?

757
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,460
Is that a person?

758
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,120
Wait.

759
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:56,920
Oh!

760
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:57,800
Shoot.

761
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,110
What's wrong?

762
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,170
There we go.

763
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,810
We're fine, everybody.

764
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,390
We're fine.

765
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,230
Don't worry about it.

766
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:15,690
Everything's good.

767
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,400
Everything is a-okay.

768
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,180
What's wrong?

769
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:23,960
Nothing's wrong.

770
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,340
Nothing's wrong.

771
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,560
Don't worry about it.

772
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:27,920
Gosh.

773
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,220
Why do you keep asking me those questions?

774
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,700
What's wrong?

775
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,680
Nothing's wrong.

776
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,280
Right, guys?

777
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,020
Everything's okay?

778
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,120
We're okay.

779
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,140
We're okay.

780
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,240
Checking the area.

781
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,700
I don't think there's anybody else around here.

782
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,840
What's wrong?

783
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,340
Nothing.

784
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,300
Did

785
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,490
you guys see that?

786
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,880
Oh my gosh.

787
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,680
Yo.

788
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,160
I'm not even gonna go touch them.

789
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,300
I'm not even gonna go touch them.

790
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,940
They're not-they're not worth it.

791
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,640
They're not worth it.

792
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,020
I'm too scared.

793
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,140
I'm too scared.

794
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,060
Okay.

795
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,740
Sorry.

796
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,380
I'm sorry.

797
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,100
I'm so sorry for your eyes, everybody.

798
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,220
Okay.

799
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,480
Wait.

800
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:36,880
East?

801
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,610
We gotta go north.

802
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,160
Okay.

803
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:49,800
Okay.

804
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,480
Okay.

805
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,140
Oh.

806
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,060
The heat vision doesn't bother me at all.

807
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,560
I'm glad.

808
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,740
Cause I'm gonna keep using it.

809
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,680
Climb.

810
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,720
Let's get our little vantage point.

811
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,540
Uh.

812
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,160
Oh.

813
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,660
It's tall.

814
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,260
Any?

815
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,570
Two.

816
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:28,870
Two.

817
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,270
Two.

818
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,150
Two.

819
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:31,770
Wait.

820
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,610
I should probably change.

821
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,090
I'm just a leaf.

822
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:38,670
Oh.

823
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:41,490
Hmm.

824
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,850
Will they still see me?

825
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:46,410
Hmm.

826
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:51,840
Hmm.

827
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,000
Where'd they go anyway?

828
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,410
I hear-oh.

829
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:04,830
There's one.

830
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,010
And then the guy's gonna go, what's wrong?

831
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,290
Oh shit.

832
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,360
Ummm...

833
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,480
What do you mean?

834
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,680
What?

835
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,260
No!

836
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,240
It was a...

837
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:29,880
It was a fly!

838
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,420
What are you talking about?

839
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:32,960
Attack!

840
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,080
Oh shit.

841
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,520
Are they gonna notice me or anything?

842
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,200
What do you mean attacked?

843
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,920
Don't be dramatic.

844
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:53,950
Oh shit.

845
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,780
Snake, you need to go.

846
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,620
Snake, you need to leave.

847
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,400
Snake, it's time to go.

848
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,640
Oh shit.

849
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:05,680
Snake?

850
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,700
Go, go, go.

851
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:09,960
Just run.

852
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,540
Please respond.

853
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,030
What if I ran up a tree?

854
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:21,390
Oh my god, there's a house.

855
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,070
Oh, I remember this place.

856
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,470
You don't even see me.

857
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,010
Don't even see me.

858
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,870
Oh, they do.

859
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:30,870
They definitely see me.

860
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,070
Oh my god.

861
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:35,210
Wait.

862
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,030
Take him down.

863
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:38,550
Guy number one.

864
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:41,910
Guy number two.

865
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:42,430
Guy number two.

866
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:44,870
There we go.

867
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,050
Come here, you.

868
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:48,290
Over there.

869
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:51,910
Come here.

870
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,520
Everybody!

871
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,420
Stay calm, okay?

872
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,180
CQC is good stuff.

873
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,360
And I'm just gonna...

874
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:05,540
Beep.

875
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,240
Oh, where's my Trank?

876
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,300
I mean, not my Trank, my Suppressor.

877
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,760
He's fine now.

878
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,260
They heard, but...

879
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,380
I mean, they already knew I was here.

880
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:16,840
Look,

881
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:21,370
they're so dumb.

882
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,210
No way this works.

883
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,230
All I did was stand behind a tree.

884
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:39,140
All I have is a cut!

885
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,220
We're totally fine!

886
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,580
Thanks for making my birthday some memorable last night off.

887
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:48,320
Even though you hate us, I still...

888
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,800
Wait, Paige!

889
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,800
I saw you.

890
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,840
Do you like my wink?

891
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:01,710
I saw you.

892
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:04,750
Let's see...

893
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:05,970
Do I need to get the...

894
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,210
No, I just have a cut, right?

895
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:08,830
So we probably just need...

896
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,110
A little disinfectant...

897
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,650
A little like...

898
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:16,310
A little bandage...

899
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,450
What else do I need?

900
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,330
Oh, a deep cut!

901
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:21,670
Suit circuit...

902
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:22,290
Cut.

903
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:45,820
Oh, shoot.

904
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,140
No, no, no, no.

905
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,420
They lost the enemy, you guys.

906
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:53,940
Winner, winner.

907
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,800
Chicken dinner.

908
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,760
What's wrong?

909
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,600
Winner, winner.

910
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,680
Chicken dinner, baby.

911
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:03,780
What's wrong?

912
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,060
This guy is...

913
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,440
Oh, he's keeping rations on.

914
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:12,960
Okay, let's...

915
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,840
I'm gonna survey the area real quick.

916
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,620
Okay, we're good.

917
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,900
Wow, you got a nice little shack here.

918
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:25,900
What's wrong?

919
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:26,880
Shadow time!

920
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,320
More bullets.

921
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,240
More bullets.

922
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,160
More bullets.

923
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,800
More bullets.

924
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,160
I'll take everything you got.

925
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,400
What else is in here?

926
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:54,650
What else is in here?

927
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:58,730
We're winning, guys.

928
00:46:58,990 --> 00:46:59,390
We're winning.

929
00:46:59,830 --> 00:46:59,830
We're winning, guys.

930
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:00,790
We're winning.

931
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,210
What is this?

932
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:04,650
What is this?

933
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:05,770
Okay.

934
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:08,230
Where's the...

935
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,890
Where are we going?

936
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,770
Oh, I need to go back around, don't I?

937
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:15,470
Shoot.

938
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,430
What is this?

939
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:19,610
Can you...

940
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:21,630
There we go.

941
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,230
There's nothing under the house, right?

942
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,030
Oh, there's something over here, too.

943
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,840
Wait, is this a little...

944
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,860
Armory or something?

945
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,540
I should blow this up, huh?

946
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,340
Wait, can I?

947
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,520
Oh, there's the door.

948
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,480
Sorry.

949
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,100
Oh, they're gonna be so hungry!

950
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,570
They're all asleep, so...

951
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,510
It should be okay if I blow it up.

952
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:01,230
Watching for traps.

953
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:09,770
It's this way, right?

954
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,130
Check the boxes in the cabin.

955
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:15,350
There was a gun in the cabin.

956
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:16,070
Oh, what?

957
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:16,550
No way!

958
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:18,550
Oh.

959
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:18,990
No!

960
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,380
I have to go all the way back.

961
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,920
I have to hope nobody wakes up.

962
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,820
Maybe I should put some guys back to sleep.

963
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:31,960
Oh, wait.

964
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,860
They're still on three Z's.

965
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:33,400
Never mind.

966
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,480
The boxes?

967
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,830
What boxes?

968
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:40,530
Oh, sorry.

969
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:44,010
These boxes?

970
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:46,050
Like these?

971
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:52,670
Other room.

972
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:53,610
What?

973
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,130
Guys, there's like five rooms.

974
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:55,630
These boxes?

975
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,090
Guys, there's so many rooms.

976
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:00,810
What are you... Oh, I'm hungry.

977
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,640
What are you...

978
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,640
Tasted terrible.

979
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,360
Oh, no.

980
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,320
I think the broken floor just goes underneath... Oh, this room.

981
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,100
Oh, I see!

982
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,180
M63!

983
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,820
A machine gun.

984
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,620
Let's go.

985
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,890
Anything under here?

986
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,240
How do I get out of here?

987
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,460
You guys, I don't even know who's saying what's wrong.

988
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,520
I don't even know where they are.

989
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:00,300
Oh, shoot.

990
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:05,900
There?

991
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,180
Oh, ah!

992
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,140
I saw somebody running.

993
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:22,880
Huh?

994
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:26,780
Um...

995
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,220
Okay.

996
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,520
Those two guys are still down.

997
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:47,200
There's a ghost roaming the forest.

998
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,540
Crawl to safety!

999
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:56,780
Oh, wait.

1000
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:57,680
Oh, there he is.

1001
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,840
There is a

1002
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:06,370
person.

1003
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,120
He's like running, running.

1004
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,480
Are you okay?

1005
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,580
What's wrong?

1006
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,780
Oh, no.

1007
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,000
Now I'm doing it.

1008
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,560
Why are you running?

1009
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,170
Oh, my God.

1010
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:27,310
Guys, they're everywhere.

1011
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,550
You guys, we gotta get out of here.

1012
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:31,850
You guys, we gotta get out of here.

1013
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:34,710
Oh, no!

1014
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,690
Guys, we gotta get out of here.

1015
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:41,490
You guys!

1016
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:44,990
Okay, I'm just gonna run for it.

1017
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,600
Oh, my God.

1018
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,440
When does that map end?

1019
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:57,860
Here we go.

1020
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:58,540
Yeah!

1021
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,500
We made it!

1022
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,420
What's wrong?

1023
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:04,900
My TNT.

1024
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,560
I blew it up.

1025
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,020
I blew it up.

1026
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,760
I blew it up.

1027
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,200
I blew it up.

1028
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:08,500
Don't worry.

1029
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:11,700
Uh-oh.

1030
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,080
He's hungry.

1031
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,560
Wait a second.

1032
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,880
This is where we came...

1033
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,360
Oh, gosh.

1034
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,060
Which way is north?

1035
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,480
I see.

1036
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:21,700
I see.

1037
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:21,860
I see.

1038
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:26,670
I'm famished.

1039
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,490
Maybe I should throw a snake.

1040
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:32,450
Where is he, though?

1041
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:38,770
Oh, my gosh.

1042
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,450
Complaining over here.

1043
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:41,110
Oh, my gosh.

1044
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:41,110
Complaining over here.

1045
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,150
Shut up.

1046
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,790
I wonder if I can just crawl over there.

1047
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,270
Can I go this way?

1048
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:53,530
Can I go this way?

1049
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,750
I hear somebody walking.

1050
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:01,230
I'm scared.

1051
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:05,610
Who was that?

1052
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:07,130
No!

1053
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,070
I hit you!

1054
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:08,510
I hit you!

1055
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:08,870
I hit you!

1056
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:09,790
Nothing?

1057
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:11,810
Shit.

1058
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:15,770
Nothing's going on.

1059
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,230
Nothing is going on.

1060
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:18,750
Chill out.

1061
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:20,570
God.

1062
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:21,630
Yeah.

1063
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:22,130
That's right.

1064
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:22,610
Okay.

1065
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:23,310
Sheesh.

1066
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,630
He, like, dodged it.

1067
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:25,970
For real.

1068
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:26,270
Right?

1069
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,690
There's no way I could have missed that.

1070
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:32,850
There's no way.

1071
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,370
I should have missed that.

1072
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:39,450
This poor guy over here is so hungry.

1073
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:40,990
Okay.

1074
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:41,630
So...

1075
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,130
It's, like, right here.

1076
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:44,410
Oh.

1077
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:45,330
Yes.

1078
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:46,110
It's right here.

1079
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,390
But avoid the trap.

1080
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,550
And avoid any other traps.

1081
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:51,090
And go north.

1082
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:52,230
South?

1083
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,150
If up on map, why south?

1084
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,660
No.

1085
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,100
Oh.

1086
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:16,800
Snake.

1087
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:20,810
Oh!

1088
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:21,250
Oh!

1089
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:22,130
Oh my gosh.

1090
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,030
I almost didn't see him.

1091
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:24,870
He's so camouflaged.

1092
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,610
Hey, B.O.

1093
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:33,830
Hello?

1094
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:34,570
Hello?

1095
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:35,270
Hello?

1096
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:36,450
Hello?

1097
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,240
No!

1098
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,180
So if I can hold him up...

1099
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,240
Don't I get, uh... something special?

1100
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,640
Won't he wiggle something out of him?

1101
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,000
I beg of you.

1102
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,660
Grant me the strength to take this

1103
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,700
You have to do it three times.

1104
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,460
Guys, I can barely hold up a single man.

1105
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,500
I don't know.

1106
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,400
I'd like to keep sleeping.

1107
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,380
You have my thanks.

1108
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,280
You can get his gun if you try and kill him.

1109
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:29,640
I have to thank you for waking me.

1110
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,840
I guess I don't have to use my...

1111
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,940
I don't like to waste the bullets, but I don't have to use my suppressor.

1112
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,360
...would have been eternal.

1113
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,340
If you hadn't shown up in a week...

1114
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:53,660
Do you hear me, Snake?

1115
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:57,820
I am the end.

1116
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:03,480
I am here to send you to your ultimate fate.

1117
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:09,540
You'll make a fine quarry for my final hunt.

1118
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,320
Nooo!

1119
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,460
Cinema rule!

1120
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,440
Wait...

1121
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:14,780
Wait...

1122
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,320
Wait...

1123
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,340
I can't wait for the cutscene end.

1124
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,240
I got it all over my hands.

1125
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,660
Because I was rushing.

1126
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,280
I picked it up to drink and I was rushing to press the R1.

1127
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,560
Nooo!

1128
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:32,350
Cinema rule!

1129
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,630
Eva, I found that sniper we were talking about.

1130
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:37,930
That's the end.

1131
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:39,030
He's a legend.

1132
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,510
Known as the father of sniping.

1133
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:44,530
I've got experience sniping in urban and marine environments.

1134
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:45,690
I'm gonna go throw it in the sink.

1135
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:45,990
What about the forest?

1136
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:47,270
Never.

1137
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:48,490
I see.

1138
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,870
Well, that forest is divided into three areas.

1139
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:52,750
I have to move, like, all my stuff off of the...

1140
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,110
A river, a plateau, and a clearing.

1141
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,190
He should be lying in wait for you in one of those places.

1142
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:59,430
Sounds like this may take a while.

1143
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,070
It'll be a test of endurance.

1144
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,650
Be careful, though.

1145
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:08,270
From what I've heard, the end has an almost supernatural knack for camouflaging himself.

1146
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,070
So, whoever moves first loses.

1147
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:16,470
This guy's over a hundred years old, though, so I should have the advantage in terms of stamina.

1148
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,850
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.

1149
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:19,810
Why's that?

1150
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,870
I've heard that his body is photosynthetic, like a plant.

1151
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,070
What is he, some kind of monster?

1152
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:26,570
Sorry, guys, sorry.

1153
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,370
On top of that, he can speak to the forest, too.

1154
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:32,170
So, in other words, he knows it inside out.

1155
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:33,250
Uh-huh.

1156
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,110
But he doesn't know you.

1157
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:37,050
I'm sure you can beat him.

1158
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,030
Don't worry.

1159
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:39,610
I intend to.

1160
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:42,110
Wait.

1161
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,050
Oh, gosh, it's all over my controller, too.

1162
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,290
No, no, no, no.

1163
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,130
Where did I throw the paper towel?

1164
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:50,330
Okay.

1165
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:05,230
Sorry, I have to go throw my desk mat into a sink so it doesn't stain.

1166
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:06,090
BRB.

1167
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,570
I think I cleaned off everything.

1168
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,250
Sorry.

1169
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,130
For those...

1170
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,390
I spilled my coffee.

1171
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:07,090
I spilled my coffee all over the place.

1172
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:10,770
And I had to go throw my desk mat in.

1173
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:13,290
In the sink.

1174
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,650
So that it wouldn't stain.

1175
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:16,650
No.

1176
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:21,390
I really like my desk mat.

1177
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:22,190
I hope it's okay.

1178
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,150
I'll let it soak.

1179
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:30,290
And then after the stream, I'll put it in the washing machine.

1180
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,100
Okay.

1181
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:39,920
Okay.

1182
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,380
Oh, gosh.

1183
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,380
That really threw me out.

1184
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:42,720
Okay.

1185
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:43,820
I'm okay.

1186
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:44,400
Okay.

1187
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:44,760
Okay.

1188
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,280
Oh, okay.

1189
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,680
We're...

1190
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,220
Okay.

1191
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,540
Okay.

1192
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,120
Okay.

1193
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:52,620
Okay.

1194
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,360
Okay.

1195
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:54,460
Okay.

1196
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:54,680
Okay.

1197
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,340
Oh, gosh.

1198
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,160
Oh, okay.

1199
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:56,920
Oh, God.

1200
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:58,040
Okay.

1201
01:00:58,920 --> 01:00:59,700
Let's see.

1202
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:00,840
What's...

1203
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,360
I didn't get the tranq sniper.

1204
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,560
So, I guess...

1205
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:14,740
Okay.

1206
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,880
I'm not going to...

1207
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:20,040
But I don't need a sniper sniper gun.

1208
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:21,700
Oh.

1209
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,020
Oh.

1210
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,780
Oh, gosh.

1211
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,240
Technically, you can sneak up on the end once.

1212
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:34,020
All you need is to aim his gun at him three times after sneaking up and grab the item before boss battle is over.

1213
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:34,600
Oh.

1214
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:37,260
Okay.

1215
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,420
I'm gonna call people to kind of...

1216
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,480
Snake, the end is a veteran sniper.

1217
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,240
Ugh.

1218
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,660
He's hiding somewhere in those woods waiting for you to appear.

1219
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,740
If he sees you, he'll shoot without hesitation.

1220
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,540
Make your way through the forest, hiding along the way, and watch out for signs of the end.

1221
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,960
Anticipate his movements and come up on his side or get behind him for a chance to attack.

1222
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,020
Be careful.

1223
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,940
The end uses a special kind of tranquilizer round.

1224
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:09,500
If he shoots you with one of those tranquilizer rounds, you'll start to lose stamina fast.

1225
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,220
When your stamina gauge reaches zero, you're dead.

1226
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:12,800
You'll pass out.

1227
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,280
Oh no.

1228
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:18,060
If you're hit by a tranquilizer round, go into the survival viewer right away and treat the wound.

1229
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:18,540
Okay.

1230
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,280
Use your knife to dig out the needle.

1231
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:20,740
Eww.

1232
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,060
If you run out of stamina, it's all over.

1233
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:28,400
Make sure you keep your stamina up by hunting for food on a regular basis.

1234
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:28,880
Okay.

1235
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:32,340
This battle will be a long, grueling sniper duel.

1236
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,320
But don't let your guard down, not even for a single moment.

1237
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:38,940
Okay.

1238
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,080
Um...

1239
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,200
Either way, you can do it.

1240
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:42,520
You got anything?

1241
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:47,040
I know it's hard to believe, but the end is apparently capable of photosynthesis.

1242
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,540
That's crazy.

1243
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,660
He's probably got an edge over you in terms of stamina.

1244
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,860
You should start hunting for plants and animals and prepare for a battle of attrition.

1245
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,000
Okay.

1246
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:02,620
Um...

1247
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:03,860
I know that, like...

1248
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,300
It's...

1249
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:05,740
Oh gosh.

1250
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:14,140
You, like, look for his, um, his little glint and then you...

1251
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:18,480
I can't remember exactly how to find him in an area.

1252
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,780
But you, like, look for the gleam of his sniper.

1253
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,700
I want to photosynthesize, too.

1254
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,980
You just do it.

1255
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:38,580
You just do it.

1256
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,400
Socroviano Forest is a big place.

1257
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:47,060
There's times like this that the map function and the survival viewer can be your best friend.

1258
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,580
Not only does it show you the terrain and the places you've been...

1259
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:51,440
Yeah, if you wait a week to find him...

1260
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:51,860
But you can also use it to figure out...

1261
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:52,360
Yeah, if you wait a week to find him...

1262
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:55,340
You can also use it to figure out which locations the end has chosen for his sniping position.

1263
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,960
But I'm not gonna do that because that's so boring.

1264
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,060
Learn the terrain and try to catch the end off guard from behind.

1265
01:03:59,060 --> 01:03:59,220
Shut up.

1266
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,440
Everybody's saying...

1267
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,900
Just change the clock on your PS2.

1268
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:06,360
No!

1269
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,400
That's so boring!

1270
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:09,600
What are you talking about?

1271
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,880
This is, like, such a cool fight.

1272
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:13,700
You wanna just skip it?

1273
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,580
It's funny, though.

1274
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:15,980
No!

1275
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:20,430
Oh, I see him.

1276
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:24,150
I see him.

1277
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:24,390
I see him.

1278
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:25,710
How can I...

1279
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:26,030
Oh, wait.

1280
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,520
How would I get around him from there?

1281
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:37,060
Hmm.

1282
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,800
He is... up there.

1283
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,580
On the...

1284
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:47,220
He is...

1285
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,720
He is up there.

1286
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:50,600
Up there.

1287
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,040
Uh...

1288
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,020
Slowly.

1289
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,400
Slowly.

1290
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,700
How do I even get up there?

1291
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,020
I don't know.

1292
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:08,340
I don't know.

1293
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:09,960
Uh-uh.

1294
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:10,680
Uh-uh-uh.

1295
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:14,440
Can we take a two-week break from MGS3 to beat the end?

1296
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:17,820
Oh, whoops.

1297
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:22,340
Snake.

1298
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:23,500
Turn this way.

1299
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:23,800
There we go.

1300
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,800
I don't want him to just see me and shoot me and all.

1301
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,120
So I'll have to...

1302
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,660
I think my camouflage is okay, but...

1303
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:36,900
Yeah.

1304
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,620
Oh, here we go.

1305
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:39,960
Nice.

1306
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:50,880
Okay.

1307
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,140
Let's go.

1308
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:52,780
Crawling.

1309
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:53,720
Crawling.

1310
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:54,080
Crawling.

1311
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:54,920
Crawling.

1312
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,040
Crawling.

1313
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,940
Crawling.

1314
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,200
Crawling.

1315
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,000
Crawling.

1316
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,780
Crawling.

1317
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:02,320
Crawling.

1318
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:02,660
Crawling.

1319
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:08,580
All the way there to his spot, his vantage point.

1320
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,180
Crawling in the grass.

1321
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:19,140
My wounds will heal and cure.

1322
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:20,400
Hmm.

1323
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,280
Oh, okay.

1324
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:28,100
Also, doesn't... wait, but doesn't the end heal in...

1325
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,760
Oh gosh, you guys...

1326
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,820
Doesn't the end heal...

1327
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:35,940
in the sun?

1328
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:38,900
Let's eat this European rabbit.

1329
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:43,960
Oh!

1330
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,820
Not too bad, alright.

1331
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,100
Oh!

1332
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,420
Maybe it will be more hassle than...

1333
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:05,850
that it's worth.

1334
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:07,870
What the heck was that?

1335
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:12,910
What the...

1336
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:15,590
What the heck was that?

1337
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:16,250
A trap?

1338
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,330
Stupid trap.

1339
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:21,850
Couldn't even reach me.

1340
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:22,870
I'm too small.

1341
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,100
Some crazy noises going on.

1342
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,100
Wait, okay, hold on.

1343
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,700
We're trying to get...

1344
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,500
I'm... oh!

1345
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:45,020
How did I... wait, okay, yeah, cause...

1346
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:45,880
Okay.

1347
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,140
Where the heck is he now?

1348
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:58,870
I think I gotta...

1349
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:05,710
I'm completely... lost.

1350
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:06,750
Come here, bunny.

1351
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:08,870
You're not too bad.

1352
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:11,030
You're not too shabby with a snack.

1353
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:12,410
I'll take it.

1354
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,600
Oh my goodness.

1355
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,220
Trying to find this guy.

1356
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,480
Okay, so he is... up there, maybe?

1357
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,060
Okay, I just gotta keep going for... okay.

1358
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:35,600
I don't think I need to... crawl, but probably for the best so he doesn't hear me.

1359
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:38,160
Can I get up here?

1360
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:40,400
Um...

1361
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,300
No.

1362
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:47,940
Guys, did I mess up?

1363
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,140
I guess we'll just keep going.

1364
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,560
For now, I'll collect food.

1365
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:55,820
No.

1366
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,660
For now, I'll collect food.

1367
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,560
Anything we come across.

1368
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,180
Um...

1369
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,200
Okay.

1370
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,060
Wanted to make sure there were no traps in there, you know?

1371
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,080
Oh, just kidding.

1372
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,400
My food... well, I can eat.

1373
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,120
I can eat.

1374
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:14,920
I still have room.

1375
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,240
Let's have a...

1376
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:18,620
let's have a...

1377
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:19,260
a...

1378
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,000
euroluminescent mushroom.

1379
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:26,660
Or...

1380
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:26,840
No.

1381
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:27,480
The ink...

1382
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,260
Oh, it tasted bad.

1383
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:28,920
Sorry, Snake.

1384
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:32,700
Sick.

1385
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,180
Sick.

1386
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,040
Okay.

1387
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,140
Ta ta ta ta...

1388
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,840
Ta ta ta ta ta ta...

1389
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,160
ta ta ta ta ta ta ta...

1390
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,240
ta ta ta ta ta ta ta...

1391
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:48,320
ta ta ta ta ta ta ta...

1392
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:49,880
ta ta ta ta ta ta...

1393
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:55,260
Da -da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba.

1394
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,020
Where are we?

1395
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:01,890
Okay.

1396
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:03,010
Okay, okay.

1397
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:07,730
Keep on crawling, Snake.

1398
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,330
Keep on crawling.

1399
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:13,570
This is a test of endurance.

1400
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,110
A test of...

1401
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:20,270
He didn't notice that, right?

1402
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:25,130
A test of stealth and stuff.

1403
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:28,090
I hope he fell asleep.

1404
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,110
Grandpa, fall asleep.

1405
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,070
Grandpa, go to bed.

1406
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:39,820
Alright.

1407
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,240
Watch your eyes!

1408
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,160
What is that?

1409
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:53,750
He...

1410
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,310
Guys, I think I don't remember where he is.

1411
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:04,150
Snake, you gotta be like a little more quiet when you do that, you know?

1412
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,350
Okay, I give up.

1413
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,430
Zero has more advice.

1414
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:09,970
Let's listen.

1415
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:11,730
Zero!

1416
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:18,470
The binoculars and first person view will prove useful in detecting the enemy's presence.

1417
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:22,990
You should also be making use of your motion detector, active sonar...

1418
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:23,730
But he's not moving!

1419
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:24,830
...and anti-personnel sensor.

1420
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:27,770
You might also try using the directional microphone.

1421
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:28,170
Oh, that's right!

1422
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,090
The Mic D!

1423
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:31,930
Mic D.

1424
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:34,030
Let's hear it.

1425
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:36,150
Let's see if we hear his little honk meemees.

1426
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:41,750
Oh, I was like, I don't have it.

1427
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:42,810
It's in my backpack.

1428
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,100
I don't usually use this, but...

1429
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:02,080
I guess I'll... Oh, my bad.

1430
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:02,960
My bad.

1431
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,480
Well, we'll get rid of the box for now.

1432
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,380
Which seems like a sin, but...

1433
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:10,800
Wait, where is my mic?

1434
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,720
Do I not have it?

1435
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,000
Oh, mic is a weapon.

1436
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:17,780
Oh, just kidding.

1437
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,660
Well, we gotta add that anyway.

1438
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:25,580
Mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic...

1439
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:26,420
Directional mic!

1440
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,120
Oh.

1441
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,800
I think I got rid of it on accident.

1442
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:49,440
Oh.

1443
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:53,270
No, no, no.

1444
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:54,450
I got rid of it on accident.

1445
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:54,930
Where is it?

1446
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:57,790
There, there.

1447
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:58,130
Okay.

1448
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,070
Okay.

1449
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:04,210
Okay!

1450
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,110
There, there, there, there, there.

1451
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:19,010
Good morning, Minso.

1452
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:20,770
My sighs are on fire from four hours of otage.

1453
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:23,870
I hope you and the other performers enjoyed your shenanigans in the back.

1454
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:25,190
Oh, enjoyed our shenanigans.

1455
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:27,410
You did so good.

1456
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:28,510
Thank you!

1457
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:33,910
He's talking to himself.

1458
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:40,290
So is he.

1459
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,480
Oh, I see him!

1460
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,920
Oh, I see him, I see him, I see him, I see him, I see him.

1461
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,600
Shoot, how am I supposed to get around him?

1462
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:54,580
Like, to behind him?

1463
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,140
I did a big old circle, and in the end...

1464
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:00,840
It didn't even matter.

1465
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:06,260
Oh, but this says this is the sniping point.

1466
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:07,340
Uh...

1467
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,620
This is the end.

1468
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,240
Where did his... where did the gleam go?

1469
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:22,540
Oh my gosh, it's raining.

1470
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:44,590
Where'd he go?

1471
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:51,820
I might...

1472
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,540
I need, like, ten hour ambiance of this, you know?

1473
01:14:59,040 --> 01:14:59,800
The other way.

1474
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:00,600
What are you talking...

1475
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:04,940
No.

1476
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,260
He was over there, was he not?

1477
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:13,000
ние

1478
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:34,580
You can use thermal goggles and binoculars at the same time?

1479
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:34,780
How?

1480
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,480
That's him though, isn't it?

1481
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:40,140
No, that's a mushroom.

1482
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,880
Where the heck...?

1483
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,400
Oh wait, if I use the mic am I even...

1484
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,900
...not gonna be able to hear him, am I?

1485
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:48,400
What!?

1486
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,160
He's literally asleep!

1487
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,420
Now's our chance.

1488
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,620
We can see him because he's asleep!

1489
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,260
Nice.

1490
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:19,920
I know I'm taking a pretty long approach to this but...

1491
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,240
Oh my god it's a cliff and it ends and how do I get up there?

1492
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,680
How the hell?

1493
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:34,220
Oh my god.

1494
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,180
He's like right there.

1495
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,160
He's right there!

1496
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:48,300
Whoops, my bad.

1497
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,100
I wanted to use the scope.

1498
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,900
BionicHippo, thank you for the five gifted!

1499
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:01,860
Thank you!

1500
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:03,580
I want to hold him up.

1501
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:04,960
I do really want to try.

1502
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,440
I...

1503
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:10,880
I'll be honest...

1504
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,220
If Apache is listening, sorry.

1505
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:17,260
I haven't really watched so many speedruns of this game.

1506
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,260
So I wonder... I'm so curious what the speedrun strat is...

1507
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,280
...for the end.

1508
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:28,740
I don't want him to wake up.

1509
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,640
How do I get up there you guys?

1510
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,240
How do I get up there?

1511
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:37,360
Ahhhh!

1512
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:41,660
Hmm.

1513
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:47,230
Taking him out early?

1514
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:48,290
Probably, right?

1515
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:54,370
Maybe...

1516
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:56,250
Oh, maybe I have to...

1517
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:59,450
...go through like one of the other areas.

1518
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:01,230
Oh gosh.

1519
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:04,090
You get him in one go?

1520
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:04,730
That's crazy.

1521
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:16,270
I've only watched speedrun stuff of MGS2 and MGS1.

1522
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:19,110
Oh, oh!

1523
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:21,130
Oh my gosh.

1524
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:29,870
Honk!

1525
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:31,030
Me-me-me-me-me-me.

1526
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:32,010
Honk!

1527
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:33,290
Me-me-me-me-me-me-me.

1528
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:35,170
Oh my gosh.

1529
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:39,310
I want to just keep crawling because I'm afraid if I wake him up on accident he will leave...

1530
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:39,430
you know.

1531
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:41,190
Honk!

1532
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:42,110
Me-me-me-me-me-me.

1533
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:42,830
Just keep...

1534
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:44,270
Just keep sleeping my man.

1535
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,550
Keep sleeping my man.

1536
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:48,890
Why not three onwards?

1537
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:50,690
I just never got around to it.

1538
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:50,690
That's it.

1539
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:53,470
Plain and simple.

1540
01:18:54,170 --> 01:19:08,330
Whenever I watch people play, there's like a YouTube channel that has 24 hour Metal Gear game play up and I have that on, essentially.

1541
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:21,530
I don't... I don't... Yeah, he's up there.

1542
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:23,190
He's up there.

1543
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,020
Oh, it's dusty.

1544
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,260
It's dusty, dusty.

1545
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:50,710
This here, right?

1546
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,490
I'm just changing my brain chemistry.

1547
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:54,090
Same.

1548
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:56,110
Or is this just a room?

1549
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:56,570
I can't remember.

1550
01:19:58,370 --> 01:19:59,210
Oh, it's just a room.

1551
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:09,410
Oh, he's a heavy sleeper.

1552
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:11,270
He's a heavy sleeper.

1553
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:30,180
Where's the... Where's the... Oh my gosh, the snake.

1554
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:30,700
Go forward.

1555
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:37,700
Yeah, grandpa's taking a nap and we're like really trying not to wake him up, you know?

1556
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,220
It's very important.

1557
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:42,180
Get him done.

1558
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:02,130
The ambiance is real.

1559
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:05,030
No, it's not a cat.

1560
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:05,810
It's a frog.

1561
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:10,800
Okay, so wait.

1562
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,480
What area am I in right now?

1563
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,400
I need to go back to south.

1564
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:20,290
Or at the west.

1565
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:34,190
Since we know he's not here...

1566
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,360
If I do this...

1567
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:42,700
Where the hell are we?

1568
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:47,860
Do I have to go all the way around?

1569
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:48,420
Hmm.

1570
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:13,070
Hmm.

1571
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:20,940
Oh, hello.

1572
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:21,440
There we go.

1573
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,040
Oh my god, grandpa!

1574
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:41,500
No!

1575
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:45,950
You...

1576
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:50,830
Oh, I keep pressing R2... R1 for some reason.

1577
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:51,550
Oh, knife.

1578
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:57,300
Grandpa, please.

1579
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,460
You weren't supposed to wake up.

1580
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:01,760
Why would you wake up?

1581
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:02,680
I guess he heard my...

1582
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,340
I'm behind a tree though.

1583
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:16,880
Oh my god!

1584
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,740
You are not in the same spot at all!

1585
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:28,060
What?

1586
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,760
You are not in the same spot at all!

1587
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,360
What happened?

1588
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,800
Oh my gosh.

1589
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,300
My damn throat.

1590
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:00,390
Is he still up there?

1591
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:06,970
Awww!

1592
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:09,750
No!

1593
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:10,490
Ahh!

1594
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:20,270
Gosh, I wonder how Delta will approach the end boss fight.

1595
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:21,930
Probably similar, right?

1596
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:25,730
Ten hour ambiance with intermittent screaming from mint freaky Gavro and these...

1597
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:26,270
And another...

1598
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:29,070
Oh, man.

1599
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:30,830
I think he ran away, didn't he?

1600
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:35,650
Gosh, dang it.

1601
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,180
Let me up!

1602
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:46,680
Swim snake!

1603
01:24:59,190 --> 01:24:59,590
Grandpa...

1604
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:02,590
Grandpa, I can kill you literally in two seconds.

1605
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:06,150
All it takes is to change my PS2 clock.

1606
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:07,090
Don't mess with me.

1607
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:08,830
Don't mess with me, Grandpa.

1608
01:25:10,770 --> 01:25:12,110
You wanna play this game?

1609
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:12,710
Huh?

1610
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:25,210
Grandpa!

1611
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:27,570
I'm trying to play this fair and square with you!

1612
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:30,670
I'm trying to play this fair and square with you!

1613
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,260
Where did he go?

1614
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,080
Where did he shoot from?

1615
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,400
Where did he come from?

1616
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:40,180
Where did he go?

1617
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,460
Where did he come from?

1618
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:47,440
And I, Joe.

1619
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:51,080
Oh, I see him.

1620
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,240
Wow, he got me in the head!

1621
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,260
Wow, Snake survived that.

1622
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,740
Or not survived, but like...

1623
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:05,880
He didn't go down.

1624
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,440
Why are you still trying to shoot him?

1625
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:11,520
He didn't come down at me!

1626
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:27,600
Stop it!

1627
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:30,020
How..

1628
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:30,740
where are you?

1629
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:36,540
Oh!

1630
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:39,700
It literally is just like, hey, this is where he is at.

1631
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:45,280
Laugh This is like where he is at.

1632
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:49,340
I don't know if we can run out of bullets.

1633
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:52,860
Oh!

1634
01:26:59,450 --> 01:26:59,910
Where'd he go?

1635
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:05,510
Wait, what?

1636
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:08,070
I heard him.

1637
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:09,030
I heard his footsteps.

1638
01:27:10,150 --> 01:27:10,690
Wait, was that him?

1639
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:11,510
That's him!

1640
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:11,770
That's him!

1641
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:12,030
That's him!

1642
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:12,350
That's him!

1643
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:12,510
That's him!

1644
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:12,710
That's him!

1645
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,140
Can I follow him?

1646
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:43,640
Okay, I get it.

1647
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:44,140
I get it.

1648
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,280
I don't want him to hear my stomach.

1649
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,020
Okay, I get it.

1650
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:46,320
I get it.

1651
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:46,620
I get it.

1652
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:49,280
Eat the rabbit.

1653
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:59,410
I'm gonna... Sorry guys for your eyes.

1654
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:03,210
Oh, his footsteps are gone.

1655
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,780
Where did he go?

1656
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,860
He's so fast for an old man who's literally on his death bed.

1657
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:36,720
Oh, I think he went to the next area.

1658
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:38,740
That's probably why.

1659
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:48,940
I think he...

1660
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,020
went to another area.

1661
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:57,430
Yeah, my camel.

1662
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:59,130
What the hell is that?

1663
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:01,930
What is that?

1664
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,730
Is that a pig?

1665
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:09,600
Oh, it's a goat!

1666
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,680
It's a goat, you guys!

1667
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:18,740
Okay.

1668
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:25,610
Camel.

1669
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:29,750
Leaf.

1670
01:29:33,230 --> 01:29:34,230
It's the goat.

1671
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,600
Or maybe he didn't leave the area.

1672
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,980
Maybe I just lost him because I'm slow.

1673
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:45,600
No!

1674
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:50,100
Oh my goodness.

1675
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:55,250
Did I lose him because I'm slow?

1676
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:57,250
No!

1677
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:58,230
No, no, no!

1678
01:29:58,230 --> 01:29:58,310
No!

1679
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:03,010
I know.

1680
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:10,950
Crouch walking?

1681
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:13,710
I wish was in this game.

1682
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:17,230
No, I don't see his footsteps.

1683
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,800
I don't see footsteps.

1684
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,580
I missed him.

1685
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,440
I don't...

1686
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,020
see that's a bird.

1687
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,280
Yeah, I guess let's try the mic, huh?

1688
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,100
Oh, wait.

1689
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:47,740
Damn mic.

1690
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:54,540
Wait.

1691
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:56,860
Did I hear him?

1692
01:31:04,570 --> 01:31:05,390
Damn mic.

1693
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:07,630
Thought I heard him breathing.

1694
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:11,510
Rock, what is your wisdom?

1695
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,050
Hey.

1696
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:17,890
Wait.

1697
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,300
I think I hear him breathing.

1698
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:27,760
Yeah, yeah.

1699
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:30,020
Oh.

1700
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,200
Oh my gosh.

1701
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,320
Oh, it hurts my eyes.

1702
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:36,420
He's this way.

1703
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:41,500
And while we're at it, we can grab ourselves a little snack.

1704
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:41,600
Plenty of time.

1705
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:44,380
Oh.

1706
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:46,520
Nice.

1707
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:50,680
Why in the middle?

1708
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:57,770
He is breathing.

1709
01:31:58,030 --> 01:31:58,770
But where?

1710
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:03,090
Holy cow, guys.

1711
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:03,910
This is gonna take forever.

1712
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:08,990
This is gonna take forever.

1713
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:18,640
Daniel, thank you!

1714
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,380
I know I'm a little late on this.

1715
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:23,600
This is my happy birthday to my favorite green ghost made silly little lady.

1716
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:25,480
Thank you!

1717
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,580
Thank you so much!

1718
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:32,860
Oh he's close.

1719
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:41,270
Oh he's close close.

1720
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:46,170
I think this might be where he's at.

1721
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:47,350
Hold on.

1722
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:52,780
That's a bird.

1723
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:00,040
Where did he go?

1724
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:00,240
Wow.

1725
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:08,700
We heard him so well.

1726
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:13,240
We heard him so clearly.

1727
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:15,240
Map?

1728
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:19,680
It's like one of these...

1729
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,500
Oh that's not a bird.

1730
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:24,960
That's mushrooms.

1731
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:51,870
He woke up.

1732
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:56,480
He woke up.

1733
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:57,560
He's rising.

1734
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:57,860
He's right there.

1735
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,840
He's right there you guys.

1736
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:00,940
Oh my gosh.

1737
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:05,480
Oh he was looking my way.

1738
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:07,400
Oh my god he almost saw me.

1739
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:09,900
Oh he almost saw me.

1740
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:10,580
He almost saw me.

1741
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,480
I was too fast.

1742
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:16,440
He heard my crawling.

1743
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:24,220
Can I sneak crawl with the d-pad even?

1744
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:32,860
Hmm.

1745
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:35,320
Hmm.

1746
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:41,780
Guys I'm nervous.

1747
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:44,500
Guys I'm nervous.

1748
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:45,240
How do I hold him up?

1749
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,120
How do I hold up?

1750
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:48,800
I just walk up and then I...

1751
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:51,620
I hold him up and then...

1752
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:52,220
What do I do?

1753
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:54,380
I'm scared!

1754
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:57,000
No MGS4 worm.

1755
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,340
Let me check my camel.

1756
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,140
See if there's...

1757
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:12,320
I don't think there's anything better than this but...

1758
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:18,540
Oh my god.

1759
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:20,920
This is the end.

1760
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:22,740
Yeah keep talking to yourself grandpa.

1761
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,060
Oh gosh.

1762
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,000
This is the end.

1763
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:46,280
This is the end.

1764
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:50,640
Point gun at head, then away, then head, then away until he drops the camel.

1765
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:51,040
Okay.

1766
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:53,280
He won't leave though right?

1767
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:02,140
I'm so scared I'm gonna mess this up.

1768
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:04,860
I'm so scared!

1769
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,440
I'm so bad at holding guys up.

1770
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:06,740
You know.

1771
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,800
I'm so bad at it you guys.

1772
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,000
Oh my god we're like right here.

1773
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:13,960
Oh gosh!

1774
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,780
Look even he's getting tired.

1775
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:32,010
Okay.

1776
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,210
This is the end.

1777
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,500
Maybe he'll fall asleep again.

1778
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,350
This is the end.

1779
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:04,790
Don't worry you won't screw it up.

1780
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:06,750
NX you have so much faith in me.

1781
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:07,530
Thank you.

1782
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:12,110
PC version not have analog.

1783
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:15,530
I'm on my PS2.

1784
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,020
I'm playing subsistence.

1785
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,460
N's breathing got me sleepy.

1786
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:28,040
If he didn't keep saying this is the end.

1787
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:31,520
Like his breathing and the ambiance would be...

1788
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:32,960
Like especially the water in the background.

1789
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,640
It'd be a really great like 10 hour loop.

1790
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:44,010
I'm even afraid to equip my gun.

1791
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:45,290
I feel like he's gonna hear it.

1792
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:49,610
I feel like he's gonna hear it.

1793
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:51,310
Oh my gosh.

1794
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:03,040
Oh my god.

1795
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:05,280
The rustling of the leaves.

1796
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,380
He's gonna be like that's not a bug.

1797
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:07,560
I know that rustling.

1798
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:09,240
That's a man's rustling.

1799
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:10,580
Oh my god.

1800
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:11,300
Don't touch the grass.

1801
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,200
I'm trying not to.

1802
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:16,060
I'm trying not to.

1803
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,600
Oh my god.

1804
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,120
That's a man's rustling.

1805
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:34,140
I know I'm...

1806
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:34,620
Sorry guys.

1807
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:37,360
I know I'm being like so stupid here.

1808
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:38,520
I'm just so scared.

1809
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:39,440
I'm so scared.

1810
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:41,560
Okay.

1811
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:43,900
I wish he'd fall asleep.

1812
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:51,390
The rain.

1813
01:38:51,490 --> 01:38:51,730
Yes.

1814
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:52,090
The rain.

1815
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:52,690
Okay.

1816
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:53,290
Okay.

1817
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:09,460
Okay.

1818
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:10,900
Oh my god.

1819
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,840
This is the end.

1820
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:13,920
Okay.

1821
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,240
Did you know that this is the end?

1822
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:15,780
I know.

1823
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:16,660
Oh gosh.

1824
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:17,040
Okay.

1825
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,320
Okay.

1826
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:17,520
Okay.

1827
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:17,680
Okay.

1828
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,160
Sorry guys.

1829
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:19,700
I'm so jumpy.

1830
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:20,180
I'm so...

1831
01:39:25,370 --> 01:39:25,790
Freeze.

1832
01:39:27,610 --> 01:39:28,950
Where did you...

1833
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:29,910
Yeah.

1834
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:31,650
That's right.

1835
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:32,670
Freeze.

1836
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:39,820
I don't think so.

1837
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:40,760
What the...

1838
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,120
I don't think so.

1839
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:47,240
No.

1840
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:48,920
One.

1841
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:52,180
Give it up.

1842
01:39:59,570 --> 01:40:00,450
Gotta put the gun away.

1843
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:14,940
Freeze.

1844
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,200
Where'd he go?

1845
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:21,280
There he is.

1846
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,440
Just run after him.

1847
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:42,430
It's okay, guys.

1848
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:44,210
We got him.

1849
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:45,750
Just gotta keep running after him.

1850
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:49,750
I just gotta keep going after him.

1851
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:51,330
I don't see anything else but him.

1852
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:54,150
Okay, guys.

1853
01:40:54,170 --> 01:40:55,730
Wait, uh, oh, there they are.

1854
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:57,310
I was like, where did his footsteps go?

1855
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:02,620
Oh my god, he's so fast!

1856
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:05,020
I think we lost him.

1857
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:15,290
Historical one-man- did I actually get one-manned?

1858
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:17,910
Wait, oh, this way.

1859
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:27,320
Guys, we're still on his trail.

1860
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:34,410
Oh, sorry.

1861
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:37,010
Uh, but actually I do- oh, no, no, no.

1862
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:38,770
Okay.

1863
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:39,110
Uniform.

1864
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:02,040
Aha!

1865
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:03,700
Yeah!

1866
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:10,610
Come on.

1867
01:42:11,790 --> 01:42:13,290
Come on.

1868
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:15,450
Sh-shimmy!

1869
01:42:15,530 --> 01:42:16,210
Shimmy!

1870
01:42:20,150 --> 01:42:20,830
Shimmy!

1871
01:42:22,110 --> 01:42:23,470
Shimmy!

1872
01:42:23,790 --> 01:42:24,470
Shimmy!

1873
01:42:24,590 --> 01:42:24,590
Shimmy!

1874
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:29,870
Yippee!

1875
01:42:31,170 --> 01:42:31,850
Oh.

1876
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:34,350
Hahaha!

1877
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:42,140
Just keep shooting at him while he's running.

1878
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:44,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1879
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:46,820
I just realized my, uh, suppressor.

1880
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:48,940
Oh.

1881
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:06,200
Run, Grandpa!

1882
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:07,500
Come on, Grandpa!

1883
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:10,120
He's so fast!

1884
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:12,940
How is he such a fast grandpa?

1885
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:14,360
I don't understand.

1886
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:16,620
Who's calling me?

1887
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:18,860
Who's calling me?

1888
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:20,760
Shut up!

1889
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:32,800
Oh, my God!

1890
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:38,540
Wait.

1891
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:39,220
How?

1892
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,040
How?

1893
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:40,900
The hell?

1894
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:43,180
Where the hell?

1895
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:44,060
Oh, shit!

1896
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:49,680
Oh, my God.

1897
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:56,240
Snake looks so cool with his- with the- with the- he looks like Splinter Cell real.

1898
01:44:03,330 --> 01:44:03,850
Ouch!

1899
01:44:06,730 --> 01:44:07,250
Phew!

1900
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:11,530
Let's eat something real quick.

1901
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:13,930
We'll eat an instant noodle.

1902
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,160
That's damn good.

1903
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:24,420
Um... ghost abuses Elder, tries to get him to join the wisdom survey.

1904
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:28,160
Put on the moss camo... ooh, true!

1905
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:28,300
True!

1906
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:30,600
True, true, true.

1907
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:34,960
We're gonna be so... no one is gonna... Holy plus 30!

1908
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,340
You guys, this is the first time I've ever had the moss camo!

1909
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:39,200
I'm so excited!

1910
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,740
Yeah, I'm so excited.

1911
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:43,400
Thank you.

1912
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:47,380
Twinning!

1913
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:48,740
Twinning!

1914
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:48,940
Oh!

1915
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:49,360
Ah!

1916
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:50,140
Gosh.

1917
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:01,430
Somehow I got him again.

1918
01:45:01,590 --> 01:45:02,450
Oops, how did I miss?

1919
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:04,350
Oh!

1920
01:45:05,090 --> 01:45:05,490
Oh.

1921
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:08,810
Oh, shoot!

1922
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:09,230
No!

1923
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:13,410
Where'd he go?

1924
01:45:14,990 --> 01:45:15,390
No!

1925
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:16,090
Oh, there he is.

1926
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:18,370
He's so fast!

1927
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:31,260
Oh!

1928
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:36,660
I didn't crawl slow.

1929
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:40,140
Sorry, I forgot to do the... I forgot to do the slow crawl.

1930
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:42,400
I forgot to do the slow crawl, my bad.

1931
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,000
This is as close as we're getting to OctoCamo.

1932
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:45,640
Let's go, baby!

1933
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,140
Oh my god!

1934
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:04,120
Hey mister, I see you running through there.

1935
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:04,600
Come here.

1936
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:08,500
You can... You can run!

1937
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,720
And you can hide!

1938
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:14,020
Boy, snake's coming for you.

1939
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:18,570
Oh, shit!

1940
01:46:19,570 --> 01:46:20,410
Wait, where did he go?

1941
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:22,950
Oh my god!

1942
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:23,590
OH!

1943
01:46:24,510 --> 01:46:24,990
Hold

1944
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:28,340
it!

1945
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:28,960
Freeze.

1946
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:32,420
Oh, shoot!

1947
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:33,800
He's not runnin', though is he?

1948
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:36,300
Uh... Oh, oh god.

1949
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:36,780
Ahhhh?

1950
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:37,340
Yes he is!

1951
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:37,880
Oh!

1952
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:39,240
Oh, man!

1953
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:45,890
Is this maybe the most chaotic end fight ever?

1954
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:46,730
Ha ha ha!

1955
01:46:47,790 --> 01:46:48,750
Ha ha ha!

1956
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:54,410
This is maybe so chaotic, and so crazy!

1957
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:55,270
Ha Gra.

1958
01:46:57,530 --> 01:46:59,830
This is like a Betty Hill skit.

1959
01:46:59,870 --> 01:47:00,470
For real!

1960
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:10,830
Does the end have to deal with loading times, I wonder?

1961
01:47:12,830 --> 01:47:17,990
Oh my god, Snake, are you okay?

1962
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:19,750
Ow!

1963
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:20,210
Shoot.

1964
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:26,670
Whoops, uh, backpack.

1965
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:27,930
No, sorry, food.

1966
01:47:28,130 --> 01:47:28,970
What's wrong with me?

1967
01:47:29,210 --> 01:47:34,570
I will have a little bit of a crab.

1968
01:47:34,730 --> 01:47:35,510
I almost said frog.

1969
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:39,990
Pretty tasty!

1970
01:47:40,250 --> 01:47:46,410
And then... oh my gosh, right in the cheek.

1971
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:50,370
In the cheek!

1972
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:54,750
Oh my gosh, Snake.

1973
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:56,730
How are you still awake?

1974
01:47:59,150 --> 01:47:59,670
Crazy.

1975
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:05,950
A little... yeah, give me a little kiss on the cheek.

1976
01:48:05,990 --> 01:48:06,450
How cute!

1977
01:48:08,710 --> 01:48:12,790
I wanted the end to be slow, methodical sniper battle of wits meant...

1978
01:48:12,790 --> 01:48:12,910
Ah!

1979
01:48:13,150 --> 01:48:14,490
Kirby redialed, man!

1980
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:20,590
Oh, gosh.

1981
01:48:21,970 --> 01:48:23,490
Wait, there he is!

1982
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:47,600
Does he still see me?

1983
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:48,980
Yes.

1984
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:51,820
Uh, yeah, he saw me.

1985
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:52,600
Oh my god.

1986
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:53,340
No!

1987
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:02,460
Oh my god.

1988
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:10,520
Oh my god.

1989
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:13,560
Ah!

1990
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:25,920
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na!

1991
01:49:31,730 --> 01:49:32,610
Come here!

1992
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:33,290
Old man!

1993
01:49:34,370 --> 01:49:36,850
He's like, god, you call yourself a son of the boss?

1994
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:37,590
She's so smart!

1995
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:38,630
What's wrong with you?

1996
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:39,390
You're a crazy person!

1997
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:41,730
Come here, old man!

1998
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:46,030
I won't, I won't stop until you're dead in the ground!

1999
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:51,780
Come on!

2000
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:53,700
Old man!

2001
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:57,580
Where are you?

2002
01:49:57,900 --> 01:49:58,480
This way?

2003
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:19,460
Can I see him?

2004
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:26,730
We see him.

2005
01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:28,970
We know where he is.

2006
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:35,560
Right there.

2007
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:40,780
Oh my god!

2008
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:42,320
I'm at 100% camo!

2009
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:52,960
How do I slow crawl through...

2010
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:58,620
...through the grass, though?

2011
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:02,540
Oh my god, it's a bird.

2012
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:06,180
Oh, he saw the bird, not me.

2013
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,720
Oh my god, he heard the bird!

2014
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:13,660
Of course he didn't want to fight the last weeks.

2015
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:20,560
Yeah, I know, it's so silly.

2016
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:33,460
Which way is he facing?

2017
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:35,080
Okay.

2018
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:49,400
How is this guy not out of stamina?

2019
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:51,720
I've chased him everywhere by now, you know?

2020
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:55,640
I've chased him all over.

2021
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:58,520
Like, this guy's gotta be out of stamina.

2022
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:04,740
If I go in the grass, will he hear me?

2023
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,720
I'm concerned about that.

2024
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:09,060
Oh...

2025
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:12,680
This is the end.

2026
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:15,320
The sun's gonna heal him, I know, I know.

2027
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:28,440
Yippee!

2028
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,680
Ah, yeah!

2029
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:34,720
We got him, baby!

2030
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:40,740
Only took, like, an hour.

2031
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:45,000
This is the end.

2032
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:47,040
Hold your breath and count to ten.

2033
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,540
Spirits of the forest...

2034
01:52:50,140 --> 01:52:51,540
...I thank you.

2035
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:56,620
The boss... would be proud of you.

2036
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:01,680
The time has come for a younger generation to rise.

2037
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:05,660
Squeak!

2038
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:07,300
Squeak, squawk!

2039
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:10,900
I've been wandering for more than a century...

2040
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:15,020
...and now my journey... comes to a close.

2041
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:18,940
What a splendid way...

2042
01:53:18,940 --> 01:53:19,400
No!

2043
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:20,560
Bird, get away!

2044
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:21,360
He's gonna explode!

2045
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:21,880
Bird!

2046
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:23,520
Bird!

2047
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:25,260
Grandpa!

2048
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:26,020
Grandpa!

2049
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:28,380
I have no regrets.

2050
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:34,920
I can return to the forum of love.

2051
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,320
He doesn't even say that.

2052
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:39,340
It's kind of crazy.

2053
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:40,720
Oh, his dentures!

2054
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,820
I hope that's collectible.

2055
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:47,520
And... yeah.

2056
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:49,220
Dramatic dentures.

2057
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:57,780
Good job, everybody.

2058
01:53:58,360 --> 01:53:59,140
Good job.

2059
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:02,220
We really Benny-hilled our way out of that, didn't we?

2060
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:10,140
And...

2061
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:22,460
The forests open up for us.

2062
01:54:24,140 --> 01:54:24,580
Ahem.

2063
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:32,520
Where is his gun?

2064
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:36,960
Where is his gun?

2065
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:40,240
Do you want to say it?

2066
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:40,760
Yes, please.

2067
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:43,960
I would.

2068
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:53,860
Thank you, thank you.

2069
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:54,600
Chuu!

2070
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:55,380
Chuu!

2071
01:54:55,540 --> 01:54:55,960
Thank you!

2072
01:54:56,220 --> 01:54:58,060
Not only you got his gun and camo...

2073
01:54:58,060 --> 01:55:00,420
You also have one of the most entertaining end fights I've ever seen.

2074
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:03,160
So happy for that.

2075
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:04,760
Snake, have you ever seen Jason and the Argonauts?

2076
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:06,640
I can't say I have.

2077
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:08,560
It's based on Greek mythology.

2078
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:10,340
Snake, have you watched anything in your life?

2079
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:10,960
There's this ship called the Argo.

2080
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:13,280
And it sets sail in search of the Golden Fleece.

2081
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:14,680
Along the way, it encounters many dangers.

2082
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:15,900
I've actually never heard of this one before.

2083
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:18,160
Live death, spontaneous combustion.

2084
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:21,600
Like bronze giants and the deadly seven-headed Hydra.

2085
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:23,460
And the vicious bird-like harpies.

2086
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:27,260
The most spectacular part of all was the battle scene...

2087
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:28,100
with an army of skeletons.

2088
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:29,220
Oh wait, maybe I do know this.

2089
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:29,920
I just didn't know the...

2090
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,200
It was like they were actually standing up and fighting.

2091
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:32,540
I didn't know the name of it.

2092
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:32,820
Are you serious?

2093
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:33,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2094
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:35,280
If you don't believe me, go see it for yourself.

2095
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:36,220
Then you'll want to see the magical movies.

2096
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:36,660
I know the skeletons.

2097
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,000
It's like classic.

2098
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:39,240
It was totally amazing.

2099
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:39,960
Yeah.

2100
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:41,040
Yeah, all right.

2101
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:43,660
If I make it back alive, I'll go see it.

2102
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:44,500
Yeah, I do remember this.

2103
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:45,100
It just came out.

2104
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:46,640
So I'm sure it'll still be playing.

2105
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:47,660
So funny.

2106
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:48,460
It just came out.

2107
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:50,920
All right.

2108
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:56,500
Where is the gun at?

2109
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:05,660
I feel like we're going to be using this camo for like the whole game.

2110
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:08,540
Sorry, snake.

2111
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:09,460
I know you hate these.

2112
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:13,200
It's on the ledge.

2113
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,720
I was staring at it?

2114
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:19,640
It was over here?

2115
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:20,940
Did I miss it?

2116
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:24,940
I stare at a lot of things.

2117
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:25,980
I look in a bunch of directions.

2118
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,360
This way?

2119
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:29,960
Over here?

2120
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,040
If I use the thermal goggles...

2121
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:35,840
It's a gun, though.

2122
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:39,820
Oh, I see it.

2123
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:40,200
I see it.

2124
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:40,540
I see it.

2125
01:56:45,870 --> 01:56:46,750
Oh, yeah.

2126
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:54,660
And let's get a little snack on the way out.

2127
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:56,980
Oh.

2128
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:58,040
Come here.

2129
01:56:58,780 --> 01:56:59,320
Come here.

2130
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:03,280
Crazy that these bunnies aren't afraid of us.

2131
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:05,560
Guys, I'm going to have so much serum.

2132
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:06,740
It's awesome.

2133
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:07,980
It's awesome.

2134
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:09,820
It's awesome.

2135
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:10,460
You guys, the bunnies?

2136
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:11,220
I have to get the bunnies.

2137
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:11,760
They taste delicious.

2138
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:14,460
I'm looking around for anything else.

2139
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:21,700
I didn't realize this until someone pointed it out, but they really did change the portrait angles for Paramedic in the future re-releases.

2140
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:24,960
Did they?

2141
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:26,640
A Diploko.

2142
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:28,580
A Momloko.

2143
01:57:29,860 --> 01:57:31,640
Got to get my Boblokos on.

2144
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:43,340
R-fruit.

2145
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:46,140
Wait, do I have this?

2146
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:47,900
R-fruit.

2147
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:48,460
Oh.

2148
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:50,100
Yes!

2149
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:51,500
The Boblokos and Mokos.

2150
01:57:56,320 --> 01:58:00,220
I don't think those were very tasty either, but it's fine.

2151
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:02,240
Oh, another snack.

2152
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:04,140
Sorry, guys.

2153
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,480
We got to fill up.

2154
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:10,920
I ate some of my good stuff, so we got to get other good things.

2155
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:12,580
Come here.

2156
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:17,840
No, my food is full.

2157
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:20,220
Let's eat some...

2158
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:20,580
Oh.

2159
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:20,720
Not the...

2160
01:58:21,580 --> 01:58:21,940
The...

2161
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:23,380
The...

2162
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:24,580
Oh, yeah.

2163
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:25,040
It said...

2164
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:25,300
Oh, wait.

2165
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:26,300
It was said to be tasty.

2166
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:26,900
Let's try it.

2167
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:30,740
Oh.

2168
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:31,820
Never mind.

2169
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:35,880
Everybody...

2170
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:37,260
All my homies hate the Boblokos.

2171
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:39,520
Thank you!

2172
01:58:39,580 --> 01:58:44,640
How many more rabbits must be murdered in cold blood and let rot before your vengeful spirit is satisfied...

2173
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:44,760
Oh.

2174
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:46,660
I'm sorry.

2175
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:48,440
I'm sorry.

2176
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:51,900
We're going the right way, right?

2177
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:52,140
We got something here.

2178
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:52,700
I gotta go north.

2179
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:57,060
Before that though, guys, I gotta go to the bathroom real quick.

2180
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:00,900
Here, I'll leave you with a good show.

2181
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:05,440
I must go to...

2182
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:09,560
the little ghost's room.

2183
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:12,880
There you go.

2184
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:14,560
For free?

2185
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:18,980
Hold on, hold on.

2186
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:26,220
Oh wait, you can't even tell because I'm...

2187
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:28,760
You can't tell because I'm green!

2188
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:36,930
The filter!

2189
01:59:39,450 --> 01:59:40,830
Me, me looks like...

2190
01:59:42,270 --> 01:59:42,830
Okay.

2191
01:59:44,210 --> 01:59:47,110
Oh, we gotta go say I'm gone fishing.

2192
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:48,930
I'm gone fishing.

2193
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:57,020
I tanned.

2194
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:57,760
Oh my gosh.

2195
01:59:58,780 --> 01:59:59,800
I'm tanned.

2196
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:02,060
Okay.

2197
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:05,180
Barely.

2198
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:51,980
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

2199
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,560
Sorry about that.

2200
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:54,620
Okie dokie.

2201
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:56,100
Sorry about that!

2202
02:02:56,380 --> 02:02:57,640
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2203
02:02:58,760 --> 02:02:59,820
Did you wash your hands?

2204
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:01,260
What do you mean?

2205
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:02,880
This time I wash my hands every time!

2206
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,660
What are you talking about, this time?

2207
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:07,400
I always wash my hands.

2208
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:09,860
I'm not some...

2209
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:11,300
moss.

2210
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:13,320
I'm not a... I'm...

2211
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:13,700
animal.

2212
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:16,660
I'm no animal.

2213
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,560
Oh, I forgot I was in.

2214
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:21,220
Oh my gosh.

2215
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:22,740
Old control mode.

2216
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:27,640
Okay.

2217
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:30,300
Onwards?

2218
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:31,640
Wait...

2219
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:33,620
Onwards.

2220
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:36,860
I think.

2221
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:38,080
This way.

2222
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:43,340
Oh.

2223
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:44,880
Oh.

2224
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:45,520
Oh.

2225
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:46,320
Oh.

2226
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:46,620
Dang it.

2227
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:48,740
I gotta go north.

2228
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:49,380
Wait.

2229
02:03:49,740 --> 02:03:53,300
This says north, but I went north last time and I went south.

2230
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:54,560
Oh, I see the X.

2231
02:03:54,780 --> 02:03:56,040
The X marks the spot.

2232
02:03:58,460 --> 02:04:00,140
There's no traps around here, are there?

2233
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:01,500
I didn't even think about that.

2234
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:02,060
I just kept going.

2235
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:07,060
Grab some...

2236
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:07,780
Oh, splint!

2237
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:08,360
Very good.

2238
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:09,980
We like those.

2239
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:14,400
What a good place to recharge, right?

2240
02:04:20,690 --> 02:04:22,250
Call Sigint with the end's rifle?

2241
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:22,750
Oh yeah!

2242
02:04:23,070 --> 02:04:24,210
I've never heard...

2243
02:04:24,210 --> 02:04:28,330
Oh wait, I didn't...

2244
02:04:30,150 --> 02:04:32,290
Man, I didn't even need that sniper.

2245
02:04:32,570 --> 02:04:33,310
I'm too good.

2246
02:04:33,490 --> 02:04:34,430
I'm too good at this game.

2247
02:04:37,890 --> 02:04:39,130
I'm too good at this game.

2248
02:04:39,130 --> 02:04:39,810
Backup pack.

2249
02:04:42,130 --> 02:04:44,570
Get rid of you and equip you.

2250
02:04:45,030 --> 02:04:45,930
Oh my gosh.

2251
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:48,550
The Mosin Nagant.

2252
02:04:49,170 --> 02:04:49,670
Nice.

2253
02:04:51,570 --> 02:04:52,570
I'm just too good.

2254
02:04:52,770 --> 02:04:53,270
I'm just too good.

2255
02:04:56,050 --> 02:04:57,810
You can tell me to shut up now.

2256
02:04:59,510 --> 02:05:00,690
You can be like...

2257
02:05:01,730 --> 02:05:03,270
Shut the hell up.

2258
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:04,410
Shut the hell up.

2259
02:05:05,630 --> 02:05:06,110
Nugget.

2260
02:05:09,870 --> 02:05:11,110
Snake, what's that you're wearing?

2261
02:05:11,430 --> 02:05:12,490
It's moss camouflage.

2262
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:14,110
I got it from the end.

2263
02:05:14,930 --> 02:05:15,410
Interesting.

2264
02:05:16,210 --> 02:05:19,410
It seems to have part of the end's power sealed within it.

2265
02:05:19,950 --> 02:05:23,870
If you wear it in a place where the sun shines, you'll automatically recover stamina.

2266
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:25,370
I forgot about that!

2267
02:05:25,370 --> 02:05:28,870
It'll also give you a high rate of camouflage in Siviatogorni and Sokrovieno.

2268
02:05:28,950 --> 02:05:30,170
The end's home territory.

2269
02:05:30,630 --> 02:05:31,750
I forgot about that.

2270
02:05:32,510 --> 02:05:33,030
Woah!

2271
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:37,870
So, you're wearing woodland face paint.

2272
02:05:37,870 --> 02:05:38,710
Boktai real, yeah.

2273
02:05:40,030 --> 02:05:42,810
The woodland paint is most effective in forest environments.

2274
02:05:42,810 --> 02:05:43,830
Maybe I need to equip the gun.

2275
02:05:44,130 --> 02:05:46,890
It'll work best if you use it when infiltrating forest areas.

2276
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:48,870
It'll work best if you use it when infiltrating forest areas.

2277
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:49,390
I completely forgot!

2278
02:05:50,850 --> 02:05:53,950
I am on some photosynthesis now!

2279
02:05:54,670 --> 02:05:54,790
I am on some photosynthesis now!

2280
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:57,070
What's the times three mean?

2281
02:05:57,470 --> 02:05:59,010
That scares me a little bit.

2282
02:06:01,210 --> 02:06:01,730
What's the times three mean?

2283
02:06:01,750 --> 02:06:02,150
What's the times three mean?

2284
02:06:04,010 --> 02:06:07,240
Oh, it's the skuild!

2285
02:06:08,380 --> 02:06:08,900
Nagant?

2286
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:11,900
Yeah, It's what the End was using.

2287
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:13,660
I see...

2288
02:06:13,660 --> 02:06:19,220
The M1891-30 Mozen Nagan is a real beauty of a bolt action sniper rifle.

2289
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:19,960
Nagant?

2290
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:21,140
It's been in use since WW2.

2291
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:31,920
Mozen Nagants are created by selecting the best made weapons out of the regular M1891-30 rifle production line for their high precision, and upgrading them to sniper rifles.

2292
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:32,620
Mozen Nagants are created by selecting the best made weapons out of the regular M1891-30 rifle production line for their high precision, and upgrading them to sniper rifles.

2293
02:06:32,620 --> 02:06:33,100
Hmm, I'll go to war.

2294
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:36,020
Wow.

2295
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:51,480
Ooh!

2296
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:57,080
Wow.

2297
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:19,060
I bought one because of this game?

2298
02:07:19,300 --> 02:07:19,560
Awesome.

2299
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:26,140
One shot.

2300
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:27,260
One kill.

2301
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:39,060
The aim button.

2302
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:41,760
I tried it, but I...

2303
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:48,000
Okay.

2304
02:07:51,720 --> 02:07:53,160
Call in with the animal camel.

2305
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:54,040
Yeah.

2306
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:59,260
Wait, aim... but how do I go into first person view?

2307
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:03,100
Oh, like I am in first person, but like shouldn't I have...

2308
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:04,700
Shouldn't I be able to look through the scope?

2309
02:08:08,580 --> 02:08:09,620
Oh, L1.

2310
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:10,880
Thank you.

2311
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:15,840
Awesome.

2312
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:19,540
Awesome.

2313
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:30,260
You only have one shot?

2314
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:32,180
Actually, I have 26.

2315
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:35,620
One shot.

2316
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:36,820
One kill.

2317
02:08:38,780 --> 02:08:40,820
Yeah, you can... it does say you can zoom in.

2318
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:41,600
Oh, there we go.

2319
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:43,760
Times 10.

2320
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:47,020
Oh, guys.

2321
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,680
These guys are never gonna know what's hidden.

2322
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:52,340
Oh, let's do that.

2323
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:54,240
Oop, camel.

2324
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:59,460
I don't think I called him with the animal.

2325
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:05,780
If I kissed you right now, I bet you'd taste like a wild beast.

2326
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:10,220
Pattern clothing, face paint, tactical movements.

2327
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:14,100
These are the elements of camouflage that will allow you to deceive your enemy.

2328
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:19,080
To camouflage yourself, first press the start button to check out the survival view.

2329
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:20,540
Oh, he's just telling me basic stuff.

2330
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:22,960
Then select camouflage, and you'll see two more options.

2331
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,820
He's like, you're not camouflage, you're in leopard print.

2332
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:27,100
You're being fancy.

2333
02:09:27,260 --> 02:09:28,300
You're being fancy.

2334
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:29,640
You can change your uniform to change your field uniform.

2335
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:30,660
Simple, really.

2336
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:34,020
Make sure and choose something that'll match your surroundings.

2337
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:36,420
Rawr, rawr.

2338
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:37,500
Oh, that reminds me.

2339
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:38,780
Do you guys remember Awa Awa Dog?

2340
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:40,120
Awa Awa.

2341
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:44,040
Forgot what that dog's name was called.

2342
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:46,040
Let me try one more time.

2343
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:49,100
Covering your body is a good start.

2344
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:49,820
Okay, never mind.

2345
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:50,980
Sorry, Sagan.

2346
02:09:52,580 --> 02:09:54,120
Maybe we already got the am...

2347
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:54,640
am...

2348
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:55,160
am...

2349
02:09:56,380 --> 02:09:56,800
animal...

2350
02:09:58,160 --> 02:09:58,560
camouflage...

2351
02:09:59,100 --> 02:09:59,880
talk already.

2352
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:00,520
I don't remember.

2353
02:10:00,860 --> 02:10:03,200
I can't believe it's plus five more than the moss.

2354
02:10:03,740 --> 02:10:04,480
How the hell?

2355
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:06,140
Maybe because...

2356
02:10:06,140 --> 02:10:07,800
Wait, I never got to eat the goat.

2357
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:09,900
Wait, guys.

2358
02:10:10,060 --> 02:10:11,580
I never got to eat the goat.

2359
02:10:13,260 --> 02:10:14,020
I got it.

2360
02:10:14,060 --> 02:10:14,520
I got it.

2361
02:10:14,580 --> 02:10:15,540
It's part of my buffet.

2362
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:17,020
Should we go find one?

2363
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:20,100
So if I stand here...

2364
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:20,280
Wait.

2365
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:21,560
If I stand here...

2366
02:10:22,060 --> 02:10:23,420
my stamina will increase.

2367
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:28,160
I'm waiting.

2368
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:31,460
I'm waiting.

2369
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:35,200
We got to eat a goat.

2370
02:10:40,570 --> 02:10:42,470
We got to first find a goat.

2371
02:10:42,970 --> 02:10:43,530
Oh, wait.

2372
02:10:43,570 --> 02:10:44,330
There's sunlight over here.

2373
02:10:51,890 --> 02:10:53,370
Oh my gosh.

2374
02:10:53,470 --> 02:10:54,990
It goes up so fast, even.

2375
02:10:55,930 --> 02:10:58,190
I had no idea it would be so fast.

2376
02:10:59,170 --> 02:11:00,670
Yo, that's amazing!

2377
02:11:04,310 --> 02:11:07,410
What does Snake say when he gets the...

2378
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:15,380
When he gets the solar gun in MGS4?

2379
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:17,680
He rises it up.

2380
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:19,740
What does Kojima have with Sun?

2381
02:11:20,140 --> 02:11:20,940
He's really... Oh!

2382
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:21,660
There's a goat!

2383
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,680
I wish I could Fulton him.

2384
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:27,960
My first instinct was to Fulton the guy.

2385
02:11:28,660 --> 02:11:29,620
Oh my god!

2386
02:11:29,680 --> 02:11:30,360
Just one hit!

2387
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:31,520
I'm so sorry.

2388
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,680
He goes... Right?

2389
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:43,960
Let's throw out these.

2390
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:45,100
They taste bad.

2391
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:52,640
Your streams have been keeping me sane while laid out at home with COVID.

2392
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:54,320
Pneumonia for the past month.

2393
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:55,160
No!

2394
02:11:56,020 --> 02:11:57,600
Never fails to raise my spirits.

2395
02:11:57,660 --> 02:11:57,940
Thanks for watching!

2396
02:11:57,960 --> 02:11:58,340
Share the good vibes.

2397
02:11:58,500 --> 02:11:59,020
Oh my gosh!

2398
02:11:59,040 --> 02:11:59,920
Feel better soon!

2399
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:02,500
Feel better soon.

2400
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:03,820
I'm so sorry.

2401
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:04,260
That sucks.

2402
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:07,340
I got a goat!

2403
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:09,680
And a rabbit.

2404
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:22,820
I have a friend.

2405
02:12:22,860 --> 02:12:24,120
She sends me pictures of her rabbits.

2406
02:12:24,660 --> 02:12:26,080
I hope she's not watching this.

2407
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:27,340
They eat their own.

2408
02:12:27,660 --> 02:12:28,340
That's right.

2409
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:29,580
I hope she's not watching this.

2410
02:12:29,580 --> 02:12:30,020
It's called cecal feces.

2411
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:30,380
Oh.

2412
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:37,200
When the rabbit eats fiber, the fiber is fermented in the rabbit's appendix or cecum and turns into a nutritious substance full of vitamins.

2413
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:41,780
The rabbit excretes the substance and then eats it again to absorb the nutrients.

2414
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:42,640
Wow.

2415
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:43,400
That's a neat trick.

2416
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:44,860
I think I'll give it a try.

2417
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:45,520
Snake.

2418
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:47,900
Rabbits and humans don't work that...

2419
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:48,820
I'm just kidding.

2420
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:51,260
You really thought I was going to eat it?

2421
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:52,220
A little.

2422
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:52,880
Yeah.

2423
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:55,020
Even I wouldn't do that.

2424
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:56,560
I guess not.

2425
02:12:56,860 --> 02:12:58,880
But how do those cecal feces taste?

2426
02:12:59,120 --> 02:12:59,640
What?

2427
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:01,560
I'm just kidding.

2428
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:07,680
She doesn't understand your humor like I do, snake.

2429
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:11,500
I see you caught a markhor.

2430
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:12,200
A markhor.

2431
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:16,100
The markhor is a kind of wild goat that lives in mountainous areas.

2432
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:21,400
It's quite large, so I don't think you'll be able to capture one alive, even with a tranquilizer gun.

2433
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:23,180
You know what I love watching?

2434
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:23,580
All right.

2435
02:13:23,580 --> 02:13:27,840
Speaking of which, do you know the origin of the name markhor?

2436
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:28,640
No.

2437
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:31,980
It means snake eater in Persian.

2438
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:32,420
What?

2439
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:33,560
Snake eater.

2440
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:35,220
Lost your appetite?

2441
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:36,660
Not at all.

2442
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:38,320
So, how does it taste?

2443
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:39,960
I love the way he says that.

2444
02:13:40,180 --> 02:13:41,360
It's supposed to be pretty good.

2445
02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:42,140
Does it actually...

2446
02:13:42,140 --> 02:13:42,660
All right.

2447
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:44,000
All right.

2448
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:45,420
Does it actually mean that?

2449
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:45,940
That's crazy.

2450
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:50,660
Does it actually mean snake eater?

2451
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:52,040
If so...

2452
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:52,380
Big...

2453
02:13:53,480 --> 02:13:54,620
Huge, if real.

2454
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:07,100
I thought that maybe someone knew a guy named Mark, and he was up to some activities.

2455
02:14:10,660 --> 02:14:14,060
And, you know, he owned a lot of goats or something, you know?

2456
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:37,640
You know what's kind of messed up?

2457
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:40,380
They give you this moss, right?

2458
02:14:40,660 --> 02:14:43,300
Basically, that you're at the end of the forest.

2459
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:45,140
Do we go back into the forest?

2460
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:46,520
No, we don't.

2461
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:50,780
We go through the mountains, and then we end up at Groznygrad.

2462
02:15:04,730 --> 02:15:05,830
Markhor is so beautiful.

2463
02:15:06,030 --> 02:15:08,210
The males have huge horns that spiral straight upward.

2464
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:10,510
The folklore is that those horns are two snakes that they ate.

2465
02:15:10,630 --> 02:15:10,910
What?

2466
02:15:11,010 --> 02:15:11,870
That's so insane.

2467
02:15:11,870 --> 02:15:12,130
Insane.

2468
02:15:14,630 --> 02:15:15,950
At least I got the photosynthesis.

2469
02:15:16,250 --> 02:15:17,670
True, true, true, true, true.

2470
02:15:19,210 --> 02:15:20,370
I'm gonna turn it up, you guys.

2471
02:15:23,770 --> 02:15:24,130
Okay.

2472
02:15:25,690 --> 02:15:26,410
Oh my gosh.

2473
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:34,720
First off, let me put my suppressor back on.

2474
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:38,980
I don't use it this much, so I can use it here.

2475
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:48,190
Wacko wacko.

2476
02:15:48,590 --> 02:15:49,430
Wacko wacko.

2477
02:15:49,850 --> 02:15:50,670
Wacko wacko.

2478
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:51,870
Wacko wacko.

2479
02:15:52,330 --> 02:15:53,070
Wacko wacko.

2480
02:15:53,570 --> 02:15:54,310
Wacko wacko.

2481
02:15:56,070 --> 02:15:56,830
Wacko wacko.

2482
02:15:57,250 --> 02:15:57,950
Wacko wacko.

2483
02:15:57,950 --> 02:15:57,950
Wacko wacko.

2484
02:15:58,110 --> 02:15:59,270
Let me save real quick.

2485
02:15:59,810 --> 02:16:00,970
Do you want to save?

2486
02:16:01,430 --> 02:16:02,490
Yes ma'am.

2487
02:16:03,330 --> 02:16:08,710
I want to have this as its own individual file so that I can always go back to it if I ever want to climb the ladder.

2488
02:16:12,670 --> 02:16:13,450
Wacko wacko.

2489
02:16:13,690 --> 02:16:14,450
Wacko wacko.

2490
02:16:14,750 --> 02:16:15,530
Wacko wacko.

2491
02:16:15,710 --> 02:16:16,450
Wacko wacko.

2492
02:16:22,900 --> 02:16:27,320
Snake, have you seen Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb?

2493
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:28,280
I love this movie.

2494
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:28,560
What?

2495
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:30,200
Dr. Strangelove.

2496
02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:31,120
Have you seen it?

2497
02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:34,200
Oh my god, it's very weird hearing that in this game.

2498
02:16:34,220 --> 02:16:38,740
It's about this insane American Air Force commander who sends a bomber out to drop an H-bomb on Russia.

2499
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:40,040
It's a black comedy.

2500
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:42,160
Doesn't sound very funny to me.

2501
02:16:42,780 --> 02:16:46,880
The actor who plays Dr. Strangelove also plays two of the other main characters.

2502
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:47,500
That's a good movie.

2503
02:16:47,520 --> 02:16:47,700
I've never seen that.

2504
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:50,060
It's actually kind of funny once you get past the scary parts.

2505
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:53,700
It just came out this year, so I bet you could still go and see it.

2506
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:57,560
Maybe when I'm in a lighter state of mind, I'll give it a try.

2507
02:16:59,480 --> 02:17:04,040
It's so weird hearing her say Strangelove.

2508
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:08,860
I mean, I know obviously that's where he got the name to, but it's very weird.

2509
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:10,060
It's very weird, right?

2510
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:11,580
Wacko wacko.

2511
02:17:12,020 --> 02:17:12,420
Ew.

2512
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:14,740
Wacko wacko.

2513
02:17:15,020 --> 02:17:15,400
Okay.

2514
02:17:16,340 --> 02:17:17,160
Are you guys ready?

2515
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:31,110
We'll do the old camera angle.

2516
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:32,440
There'll be no one else.

2517
02:18:36,140 --> 02:18:42,440
Grime is the way I fly to you.

2518
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:50,680
I'm still in a dream.

2519
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,200
Snake Eater.

2520
02:18:54,460 --> 02:18:55,860
Snake Eater.

2521
02:18:55,860 --> 02:18:59,080
Snake Eater.

2522
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:02,580
I'm still in a dream.

2523
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:05,280
Snake Eater.

2524
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,840
Bum bum bum bum.

2525
02:19:22,380 --> 02:19:23,580
My god.

2526
02:19:23,660 --> 02:19:24,840
Oh my god.

2527
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:26,740
We just climbed all the way up that baby.

2528
02:19:28,660 --> 02:19:31,080
Dog Strings, thank you so much for the Tony gift.

2529
02:19:31,140 --> 02:19:31,740
Thank you.

2530
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:39,800
Every time, every time, every time, every time, every time, every time, every time, every time.

2531
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:40,520
Jump.

2532
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:41,180
Okay!

2533
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:54,710
Snake,

2534
02:20:00,420 --> 02:20:01,240
what's wrong?

2535
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:10,340
One more time.

2536
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:12,180
One more time.

2537
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:15,920
Defeated by the ladder.

2538
02:20:16,420 --> 02:20:17,440
Snake, what's wrong?

2539
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:19,140
You can't even climb a ladder properly.

2540
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:19,620
Snake!

2541
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:20,160
Snake!

2542
02:20:24,570 --> 02:20:25,250
Encore, encore.

2543
02:20:26,470 --> 02:20:27,730
Which angle do you guys prefer?

2544
02:20:27,850 --> 02:20:28,910
I actually prefer this one.

2545
02:20:29,210 --> 02:20:30,890
Kind of sad that they changed it.

2546
02:20:42,340 --> 02:20:43,420
I guess you can do that.

2547
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:44,380
What a thrill.

2548
02:20:48,290 --> 02:20:51,590
I'm searching and I'm melting to you.

2549
02:20:52,930 --> 02:20:59,070
Fear in my heart.

2550
02:20:59,730 --> 02:21:03,890
But you're so supreme.

2551
02:21:04,790 --> 02:21:07,150
I like that they changed the pacing.

2552
02:21:07,410 --> 02:21:09,050
I give my life.

2553
02:21:10,090 --> 02:21:13,990
Not for honor, but for...

2554
02:21:18,530 --> 02:21:21,150
In my time.

2555
02:21:23,070 --> 02:21:26,550
There'll be no one else.

2556
02:21:30,360 --> 02:21:37,760
Cry the way I fly to you.

2557
02:21:41,480 --> 02:21:45,980
I'm still in a dream.

2558
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,780
Snake it up.

2559
02:21:53,620 --> 02:21:57,860
I'm still in a dream.

2560
02:21:58,840 --> 02:22:01,060
Snake it up.

2561
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:07,160
Snake it up.

2562
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:11,840
Snake it up.

2563
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:12,680
Again, again, again.

2564
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:12,940
No.

2565
02:22:15,540 --> 02:22:16,220
Good stuff.

2566
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:17,660
Good stuff.

2567
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:18,960
Good stuff, good stuff.

2568
02:22:21,580 --> 02:22:23,580
Good stuff, good stuff, good stuff.

2569
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:26,880
Again.

2570
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:29,240
Again.

2571
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:31,040
Again.

2572
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:35,400
Oh mosh.

2573
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:37,120
I got to use you for two seconds.

2574
02:22:37,640 --> 02:22:38,760
It's pretty nice though.

2575
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:42,120
Now we get to be choco chip.

2576
02:22:43,540 --> 02:22:44,120
Yummy.

2577
02:22:45,140 --> 02:22:45,720
Wait.

2578
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:46,900
Animals.

2579
02:22:47,540 --> 02:22:48,780
We get to be an animal.

2580
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:54,670
These look like...

2581
02:22:54,670 --> 02:22:56,250
Like traps over here.

2582
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:03,040
Choco chip.

2583
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:08,500
Alright, once we go down there's no coming back up.

2584
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:11,100
That's it?

2585
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:13,000
Let's see.

2586
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:16,520
Oh yes, there's these birds and stuff.

2587
02:23:16,980 --> 02:23:17,900
Is that a snake?

2588
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:18,400
Yeah...

2589
02:23:18,900 --> 02:23:20,340
Alright, sorry for your eyes.

2590
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:26,840
Wait, is that a bird or a person?

2591
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:28,820
That's a bird, right?

2592
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:31,200
I can't remember where the people are.

2593
02:23:31,460 --> 02:23:32,660
Stay away from me, other snake!

2594
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:35,220
I'm an animal.

2595
02:23:35,220 --> 02:23:36,120
I'm an animal right now, I'm an animal.

2596
02:23:44,580 --> 02:23:45,440
Where are the people?

2597
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,520
90% camouflage is kinda crazy.

2598
02:23:50,920 --> 02:23:52,300
It's a bird person.

2599
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:56,560
Wait.

2600
02:23:57,720 --> 02:23:58,600
There we go.

2601
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:05,740
Oh, I was like, why is my suppressor not on?

2602
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,520
Cause I killed myself.

2603
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:10,460
Wait, where is he?

2604
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:15,340
I see another guy over there too.

2605
02:24:19,860 --> 02:24:20,360
What the?

2606
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:21,260
Where did he go?

2607
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:22,600
Mister?

2608
02:24:25,660 --> 02:24:26,700
Where did... oh there he is.

2609
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:35,740
He's looking straight at me.

2610
02:24:37,380 --> 02:24:39,200
He was looking right at me!

2611
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:42,380
This area freaks me out.

2612
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:43,780
Oh my gosh, this is a scorpion isn't it?

2613
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:46,800
Cause I can't...

2614
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:53,240
It's so lumpy, I can't see where the guys are, you know?

2615
02:24:55,380 --> 02:24:56,340
Where are you guy?

2616
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:57,920
Oh, you're still too far.

2617
02:25:01,180 --> 02:25:02,240
Oh, there's another guy.

2618
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:12,540
I am an animal, I am an animal.

2619
02:25:13,180 --> 02:25:14,100
Yeah, it's lumpy!

2620
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:16,420
What else would you call it?

2621
02:25:16,480 --> 02:25:16,760
Oops, sorry.

2622
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:19,120
How else would you say it?

2623
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:22,740
Dang it.

2624
02:25:22,820 --> 02:25:23,500
Oh, I'm so close.

2625
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:27,520
Scared off the bird.

2626
02:25:30,200 --> 02:25:31,680
I'm gonna put on thermals again.

2627
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:34,180
One, two guys?

2628
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:36,520
That's it, I think.

2629
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:38,420
Two, thank you!

2630
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:39,720
Snack it up!

2631
02:25:40,260 --> 02:25:41,760
Can I listen to your version, Minto?

2632
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:42,600
No!

2633
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,660
My version is way not good compared to the original.

2634
02:25:46,940 --> 02:25:49,120
The original will always reign supreme to me.

2635
02:25:58,120 --> 02:25:58,980
Oh my gosh.

2636
02:25:59,140 --> 02:25:59,700
Hello?

2637
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:00,700
Hello, aim?

2638
02:26:00,820 --> 02:26:02,520
Aim, aim, aim, aim!

2639
02:26:07,540 --> 02:26:10,240
What is VTuber playing on PS2?

2640
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:15,040
I'm playing Subsistence on my PS2.

2641
02:26:33,300 --> 02:26:34,260
Got him.

2642
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:36,760
Oh my god, there's another guy!

2643
02:26:41,320 --> 02:26:42,560
Of course there is.

2644
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:46,780
You can indirectly eat a gu- Oh, true!

2645
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:50,200
Because the birds will like, eat them, right?

2646
02:26:50,380 --> 02:26:52,840
And then you eat the bird, and then you eat the guard.

2647
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:54,900
That's kind of sick, isn't it?

2648
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:57,340
That's like the most...

2649
02:26:58,800 --> 02:26:59,980
Power of aim assist.

2650
02:27:00,820 --> 02:27:01,260
What?

2651
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:02,820
What aim assist?

2652
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:04,860
I'm doing this all on my lonesome.

2653
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:10,040
I wish I had aim assist.

2654
02:27:10,840 --> 02:27:11,900
No harm in that.

2655
02:27:13,700 --> 02:27:14,940
Oh, shoot.

2656
02:27:15,530 --> 02:27:17,080
I hate missing.

2657
02:27:17,720 --> 02:27:20,260
I hate missing because it wastes...

2658
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:21,620
Shrank.

2659
02:27:21,900 --> 02:27:23,380
It's my birthday today, Andrew!

2660
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:25,020
Happy birthday!

2661
02:27:27,810 --> 02:27:30,160
Happy birthday to you.

2662
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:33,060
Happy birthday to you.

2663
02:27:33,420 --> 02:27:36,240
Happy birthday dear Andrew.

2664
02:27:37,610 --> 02:27:40,220
Happy birthday to...

2665
02:27:40,220 --> 02:27:40,580
Happy birthday to you.

2666
02:27:43,980 --> 02:27:45,020
Happy birthday.

2667
02:27:47,420 --> 02:27:47,940
Yippee.

2668
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:49,440
Yippee yippee.

2669
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:51,840
Oops.

2670
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:53,240
Hold on.

2671
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:54,680
Let's loot.

2672
02:27:55,660 --> 02:27:57,040
I think I need more...

2673
02:27:58,260 --> 02:27:59,200
Mark 22.

2674
02:28:01,420 --> 02:28:02,700
Bullets, if you have any.

2675
02:28:03,220 --> 02:28:05,280
Do you have any tranquilizer bullets?

2676
02:28:05,380 --> 02:28:06,020
For me?

2677
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:07,360
That would be great.

2678
02:28:10,220 --> 02:28:10,540
Oh.

2679
02:28:14,380 --> 02:28:17,260
I have to kill the guards though for them to get eaten, right?

2680
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:19,560
I don't want to do that.

2681
02:28:19,940 --> 02:28:22,160
But it is pretty funny to watch them get eaten by birds.

2682
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:30,320
I thought I heard someone walking.

2683
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:34,260
What the?

2684
02:28:34,600 --> 02:28:35,480
Wait, there was another guy?

2685
02:28:38,260 --> 02:28:38,640
Where?

2686
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:42,760
I'm seeing things.

2687
02:28:42,760 --> 02:28:44,300
Who are you talking...

2688
02:28:44,300 --> 02:28:44,680
What?

2689
02:28:44,740 --> 02:28:45,020
Who?

2690
02:28:46,580 --> 02:28:47,020
Where?

2691
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:50,600
Huh?

2692
02:28:57,790 --> 02:28:58,230
Where?

2693
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:01,590
Right...

2694
02:29:01,590 --> 02:29:04,510
Oh my gosh.

2695
02:29:05,630 --> 02:29:07,350
I didn't even notice him up there.

2696
02:29:08,630 --> 02:29:09,510
I can get him.

2697
02:29:11,490 --> 02:29:11,930
Hello?

2698
02:29:12,610 --> 02:29:13,130
See?

2699
02:29:13,710 --> 02:29:14,370
Easy peasy.

2700
02:29:15,410 --> 02:29:16,290
Gosh.

2701
02:29:17,190 --> 02:29:18,730
You guys have good eye.

2702
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:28,060
Is there any other secret men?

2703
02:29:43,030 --> 02:29:43,470
Awesome.

2704
02:29:45,530 --> 02:29:47,370
Now here comes my least favorite part.

2705
02:29:49,290 --> 02:29:51,470
We're going into my least favorite part.

2706
02:29:52,650 --> 02:29:54,170
I wasn't talking bad about your aim.

2707
02:29:54,190 --> 02:29:56,130
I was talking about how bad analog sticks are for aiming.

2708
02:29:56,310 --> 02:29:56,750
Oh no, no.

2709
02:29:56,790 --> 02:29:57,230
You're all good.

2710
02:29:57,730 --> 02:29:58,430
It's both.

2711
02:30:01,570 --> 02:30:02,290
It's both.

2712
02:30:02,530 --> 02:30:03,450
My aim is bad.

2713
02:30:03,650 --> 02:30:04,350
And also...

2714
02:30:05,390 --> 02:30:05,910
Also...

2715
02:30:05,910 --> 02:30:06,790
You want to save?

2716
02:30:06,910 --> 02:30:07,230
Um...

2717
02:30:09,030 --> 02:30:09,550
Also...

2718
02:30:09,550 --> 02:30:10,410
The controllers.

2719
02:30:15,570 --> 02:30:21,430
Yeah, we go from mountain, which I really don't like this part, into fury.

2720
02:30:21,590 --> 02:30:22,270
So, um...

2721
02:30:22,270 --> 02:30:23,230
Guys...

2722
02:30:24,430 --> 02:30:24,950
Guys...

2723
02:30:26,210 --> 02:30:26,730
Guys...

2724
02:30:26,730 --> 02:30:26,990
Guys...

2725
02:30:29,620 --> 02:30:30,140
Guys...

2726
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:30,160
Guys...

2727
02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:31,140
I hate this part.

2728
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:33,080
Snake, have you ever seen the guns of Navarone?

2729
02:30:33,460 --> 02:30:33,900
Navarone?

2730
02:30:33,900 --> 02:30:34,220
Never.

2731
02:30:34,320 --> 02:30:35,120
Actually, I don't know this one.

2732
02:30:35,140 --> 02:30:38,920
It's about a mission to blow up the huge guns on the island of Navarone during World War II.

2733
02:30:39,740 --> 02:30:44,280
Six men are chosen to participate in the operation, each with his own special ability.

2734
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:48,560
They only have until an English destroyer passes by the island to complete their mission.

2735
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:54,140
Facing impossible odds, the six men have to sneak onto the island from a cliff on the southern shore.

2736
02:30:54,740 --> 02:30:58,000
That doesn't sound like something I'd want to watch in my free time.

2737
02:30:58,720 --> 02:31:01,980
Maybe not for you, but the Major was absolutely crazy about it.

2738
02:31:02,040 --> 02:31:04,540
Yeah, because the Major doesn't go onto the front lines.

2739
02:31:04,660 --> 02:31:05,520
He told me to tell you how great it was.

2740
02:31:05,980 --> 02:31:08,540
Tell him I'll go see it as soon as I get back to the States.

2741
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:09,520
Snake's making a lot of promises.

2742
02:31:09,760 --> 02:31:10,220
Do you want to tell him yourself?

2743
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:13,420
No, let's save that for later.

2744
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:14,900
I'd better get back to the mission.

2745
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:16,120
Yeah.

2746
02:31:16,980 --> 02:31:18,260
Harrison Ford was in the sequel?

2747
02:31:19,060 --> 02:31:19,620
Oh, boy.

2748
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:20,680
You're selling it?

2749
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:27,280
I sense an aura of PTSD when mentioning the fury.

2750
02:31:28,640 --> 02:31:29,500
A tad.

2751
02:31:29,860 --> 02:31:30,860
Like a little bit.

2752
02:31:31,220 --> 02:31:31,840
Oh, yeah!

2753
02:31:31,940 --> 02:31:33,100
I blew up the helicopter!

2754
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:36,140
We don't have the helicopter, you guys.

2755
02:31:36,220 --> 02:31:36,840
I blew it up.

2756
02:31:36,940 --> 02:31:37,320
Oh, shit.

2757
02:31:39,140 --> 02:31:41,540
Oh, there's little floaty men, though.

2758
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:42,040
Shoot.

2759
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:44,700
Oh, I hate floaty guys.

2760
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:46,940
Why is there got to be floaty guys?

2761
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:57,780
Scorpion, watch out.

2762
02:31:58,500 --> 02:31:59,620
Watch out, Scorpion.

2763
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:02,640
Maybe I can snipe him.

2764
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:05,440
Will they hear it if I snipe him?

2765
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:05,740
I wonder.

2766
02:32:10,630 --> 02:32:11,970
Is he coming towards me?

2767
02:32:14,730 --> 02:32:16,890
Is he coming towards me?

2768
02:32:17,290 --> 02:32:18,210
Oh, that's not.

2769
02:32:33,050 --> 02:32:33,810
Oh, shoot.

2770
02:32:35,390 --> 02:32:38,190
Yeah, just your imagination.

2771
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:40,770
Oh, my gosh.

2772
02:32:40,950 --> 02:32:42,030
It's hard to use this.

2773
02:32:59,930 --> 02:33:01,030
No, he fell asleep.

2774
02:33:02,050 --> 02:33:03,230
No, no, he fell asleep.

2775
02:33:03,330 --> 02:33:03,810
I promise.

2776
02:33:04,630 --> 02:33:05,330
Oh, my gosh.

2777
02:33:06,490 --> 02:33:07,370
He fell asleep.

2778
02:33:07,510 --> 02:33:07,930
I promise.

2779
02:33:10,170 --> 02:33:11,210
I didn't kill him.

2780
02:33:11,770 --> 02:33:14,210
He fell asleep and did it himself.

2781
02:33:14,690 --> 02:33:15,990
Wait, are they going to come from this way?

2782
02:33:17,110 --> 02:33:17,710
Oh, shoot.

2783
02:33:17,930 --> 02:33:18,610
Yes, they are.

2784
02:33:20,530 --> 02:33:24,370
Funny, funny, funny, funny thing about causing an alert.

2785
02:33:24,370 --> 02:33:25,290
They come from everywhere.

2786
02:34:23,540 --> 02:34:25,240
I said it's no one, please.

2787
02:34:25,980 --> 02:34:26,920
Where's my...

2788
02:34:27,700 --> 02:34:29,000
I have the cigar.

2789
02:34:29,440 --> 02:34:30,120
Oh, okay, hold on.

2790
02:34:31,180 --> 02:34:31,800
Let's see.

2791
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:34,400
Let's unequip...

2792
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:38,940
The D-Mic.

2793
02:34:39,640 --> 02:34:40,940
I want the book, too.

2794
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:43,220
We'll just re-equip it another time.

2795
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:46,960
I have my snake, too.

2796
02:34:46,960 --> 02:34:48,480
Okay, we have the snake.

2797
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:49,860
Cardboard box time?

2798
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:50,400
No way.

2799
02:34:50,580 --> 02:34:55,720
There's no reason for a cardboard box to be here, right?

2800
02:34:57,460 --> 02:34:58,740
Why am I in an alert?

2801
02:34:58,840 --> 02:35:00,440
I got him.

2802
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:01,220
I killed...

2803
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:03,300
Watch out for this person.

2804
02:35:06,620 --> 02:35:07,920
I think they noticed me.

2805
02:35:13,110 --> 02:35:14,670
Guys, I think they noticed me.

2806
02:35:17,070 --> 02:35:17,950
That's kind of bad.

2807
02:35:18,570 --> 02:35:19,010
Um...

2808
02:35:19,010 --> 02:35:20,810
I can't shoot floaty men.

2809
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:27,370
I think I should just start over.

2810
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:30,850
I think I should just...

2811
02:35:30,850 --> 02:35:31,450
Oh, gosh.

2812
02:35:31,870 --> 02:35:36,070
I think maybe I should just start over and then not shoot that guy.

2813
02:35:36,590 --> 02:35:37,070
Maybe.

2814
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:52,860
Wait, there's a hole.

2815
02:35:54,100 --> 02:35:55,260
Oh, there's a whole alarm.

2816
02:35:55,640 --> 02:35:56,060
Oh, my God.

2817
02:35:56,060 --> 02:35:57,380
You're kidding me, right?

2818
02:35:59,160 --> 02:35:59,980
You're kidding me.

2819
02:36:04,220 --> 02:36:04,580
Oh,

2820
02:36:08,830 --> 02:36:09,050
my gosh.

2821
02:36:09,150 --> 02:36:09,910
How did you...

2822
02:36:12,930 --> 02:36:13,830
Maybe I just run.

2823
02:36:14,570 --> 02:36:15,470
Time to run for it.

2824
02:36:16,270 --> 02:36:17,030
I hear them.

2825
02:36:17,090 --> 02:36:18,750
I hear them whirring by me.

2826
02:36:19,370 --> 02:36:20,090
Go, snake!

2827
02:36:20,290 --> 02:36:20,650
Go!

2828
02:36:21,750 --> 02:36:22,550
Just go, snake!

2829
02:36:23,350 --> 02:36:23,710
Crawl.

2830
02:36:24,030 --> 02:36:24,610
Snake, crawl.

2831
02:36:25,990 --> 02:36:28,230
Snake, be like the snake you are and crawl in this hole.

2832
02:36:29,390 --> 02:36:29,990
There we go.

2833
02:36:33,490 --> 02:36:34,330
I think I'm good.

2834
02:36:35,530 --> 02:36:36,770
I think I'm safe.

2835
02:36:39,150 --> 02:36:40,330
There's no way they'll come in here.

2836
02:36:41,770 --> 02:36:42,650
Oh, this is...

2837
02:36:42,650 --> 02:36:44,030
Oh, they can maybe come in here.

2838
02:36:44,230 --> 02:36:45,150
This is a good snake.

2839
02:36:46,270 --> 02:36:47,170
Will they come in here?

2840
02:36:47,670 --> 02:36:48,070
No.

2841
02:36:52,730 --> 02:36:54,170
I think I'm good on...

2842
02:36:54,170 --> 02:36:54,550
Okay.

2843
02:36:57,390 --> 02:36:58,670
Is he circling me?

2844
02:36:58,850 --> 02:36:59,490
He's trying...

2845
02:36:59,490 --> 02:37:00,150
He's going to eat me?

2846
02:37:00,150 --> 02:37:01,090
He's going to eat me?

2847
02:37:01,150 --> 02:37:01,150
He's going to eat me?

2848
02:37:01,190 --> 02:37:01,490
For real?

2849
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:07,820
Sneak 100?

2850
02:37:18,170 --> 02:37:20,070
The snake is going to eat me.

2851
02:37:23,090 --> 02:37:24,890
He's circling my feet.

2852
02:37:29,230 --> 02:37:32,150
I'm safe inside the snake ring, you guys.

2853
02:37:32,410 --> 02:37:34,530
They can't see me inside the snake ring.

2854
02:37:42,810 --> 02:37:43,210
Ouroboros.

2855
02:37:47,350 --> 02:37:49,010
I can hear them walking around.

2856
02:37:49,190 --> 02:37:51,070
I have to see if they're going to come in here.

2857
02:37:51,210 --> 02:37:51,950
If they'll sneak past.

2858
02:37:57,860 --> 02:38:02,920
I would tranquilize him and take him home if I had any more bullets, but I don't.

2859
02:38:07,420 --> 02:38:08,660
I hear them walking.

2860
02:38:13,780 --> 02:38:15,560
We might have to actually kill people here.

2861
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:19,360
We might have to kill here.

2862
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:20,720
My river.

2863
02:38:20,840 --> 02:38:22,580
No, my river was so clean.

2864
02:38:24,660 --> 02:38:25,660
You have the Mosin.

2865
02:38:25,660 --> 02:38:27,400
Yeah, but it makes a lot of... It's loud.

2866
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:27,920
It's loud.

2867
02:38:32,820 --> 02:38:34,440
Any sea bears around?

2868
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:39,180
Sorry, I'm just going to wait out the caution.

2869
02:38:41,300 --> 02:38:42,620
I didn't kill him.

2870
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:44,860
I don't think it counts.

2871
02:38:44,920 --> 02:38:46,500
I put him to sleep and then he crashed.

2872
02:38:46,820 --> 02:38:47,860
I don't think it counts.

2873
02:38:49,780 --> 02:38:50,180
Right?

2874
02:38:50,440 --> 02:38:50,840
Like...

2875
02:38:51,980 --> 02:38:55,220
I don't think it counts because it wasn't a direct kill of mine.

2876
02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:01,660
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2877
02:39:01,820 --> 02:39:03,760
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2878
02:39:03,880 --> 02:39:05,200
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2879
02:39:05,340 --> 02:39:06,620
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2880
02:39:06,740 --> 02:39:08,020
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2881
02:39:08,120 --> 02:39:09,300
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2882
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:09,580
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2883
02:39:09,580 --> 02:39:10,260
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2884
02:39:10,260 --> 02:39:10,560
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2885
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:13,060
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2886
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:15,700
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2887
02:39:15,700 --> 02:39:15,720
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2888
02:39:16,020 --> 02:39:19,020
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2889
02:39:19,180 --> 02:39:19,980
I'm safe inside the snake ring.

2890
02:39:19,980 --> 02:39:20,500
What is the guys?

2891
02:39:20,740 --> 02:39:21,760
Oh my god.

2892
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:23,140
What's wrong?

2893
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:26,000
No!

2894
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,320
Oh my gosh!

2895
02:39:30,740 --> 02:39:32,160
Get out of my hole!

2896
02:39:39,800 --> 02:39:41,020
Oh my god!

2897
02:39:45,360 --> 02:39:46,200
What's wrong?

2898
02:39:46,460 --> 02:39:47,420
What's wrong?

2899
02:39:47,740 --> 02:39:48,640
What's wrong?

2900
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:50,040
What's wrong?

2901
02:39:55,870 --> 02:39:59,630
Okay, maybe that's all of them, maybe.

2902
02:40:10,220 --> 02:40:11,840
How many guys did I put to sleep?

2903
02:40:17,150 --> 02:40:18,250
I'm too good at this game.

2904
02:40:19,210 --> 02:40:23,030
That's why I'm stuck in a hole, surrounded by a snake.

2905
02:40:27,050 --> 02:40:28,650
I should have just grenaded them, huh?

2906
02:40:30,650 --> 02:40:32,350
I don't think this guy is leaving.

2907
02:40:35,210 --> 02:40:36,070
No way!

2908
02:40:36,250 --> 02:40:36,630
What?

2909
02:40:36,950 --> 02:40:39,150
I didn't take out that many people!

2910
02:40:39,790 --> 02:40:40,770
I can't believe they left.

2911
02:40:40,790 --> 02:40:44,730
They had a prototype to MGS4's threat ring system all the way back in Sekiro.

2912
02:40:55,660 --> 02:40:57,300
Should I just die and restart?

2913
02:40:59,000 --> 02:40:59,500
There's...

2914
02:41:00,380 --> 02:41:03,040
Is it bugged?

2915
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:05,780
I didn't put to sleep that many people.

2916
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:12,480
Okay, it's going down much more now.

2917
02:41:12,680 --> 02:41:15,340
As long as I don't notice somebody else.

2918
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:19,360
Okay, it's finally going down.

2919
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:23,020
It's finally going down.

2920
02:41:25,660 --> 02:41:27,040
And this guy right here!

2921
02:41:29,260 --> 02:41:30,720
I'll have to CQC him.

2922
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:35,220
Or maybe I can hold him up and then kill him.

2923
02:41:35,400 --> 02:41:36,160
No, I'm just kidding.

2924
02:41:37,980 --> 02:41:38,940
I'll CQC him.

2925
02:41:39,180 --> 02:41:40,980
I'll make him shimmy for me.

2926
02:41:43,640 --> 02:41:45,600
I think that snake is actually Minto.

2927
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:47,360
Minto would totally circle a snake like that.

2928
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:52,800
And I'm eating my own ass.

2929
02:41:57,280 --> 02:41:58,740
Nah, the snake's a simp.

2930
02:42:00,060 --> 02:42:01,320
Okay, oh my gosh.

2931
02:42:02,900 --> 02:42:04,320
Wiggle for me, little guy.

2932
02:42:04,540 --> 02:42:06,100
Why is this guy just chilling here?

2933
02:42:08,020 --> 02:42:10,080
So what do I do about the worry button?

2934
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:12,060
About the drone people?

2935
02:42:13,020 --> 02:42:13,420
Ciphers?

2936
02:42:14,340 --> 02:42:15,580
Not ciphers, but you know.

2937
02:42:16,300 --> 02:42:17,400
What do I...

2938
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:21,120
What do I do about them?

2939
02:42:21,160 --> 02:42:21,240
What do I do about them?

2940
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:22,040
I just have to be really sneaky?

2941
02:42:23,240 --> 02:42:24,480
Make sure they don't see me?

2942
02:42:27,800 --> 02:42:29,060
Eee old ciphers.

2943
02:42:30,660 --> 02:42:31,060
Eee old ciphers.

2944
02:42:31,780 --> 02:42:32,180
Eee old ciphers.

2945
02:42:32,180 --> 02:42:32,420
Cipher.

2946
02:42:37,140 --> 02:42:39,020
Reminder, you will never match her for you.

2947
02:42:39,260 --> 02:42:40,060
Reminder, you will never match her for you.

2948
02:42:40,060 --> 02:42:41,940
You guys are quite freaky yourselves.

2949
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:45,040
But I like that.

2950
02:42:46,760 --> 02:42:47,940
We're all freaks together.

2951
02:42:48,180 --> 02:42:48,400
Okay?

2952
02:42:58,430 --> 02:42:59,890
Chat reflects the streamer.

2953
02:43:00,230 --> 02:43:01,190
Okay, we're almost there.

2954
02:43:01,270 --> 02:43:01,610
We're almost there.

2955
02:43:03,330 --> 02:43:05,150
Once we get these extra guys gone.

2956
02:43:05,230 --> 02:43:10,730
Sorry to just be chilling here for a whole hundred plus seconds.

2957
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:20,900
He might leave once the caution's over.

2958
02:43:21,700 --> 02:43:22,600
And... ah!

2959
02:43:24,710 --> 02:43:25,730
Alright, let's give him...

2960
02:43:27,010 --> 02:43:28,350
Let's give him a couple more seconds.

2961
02:43:28,930 --> 02:43:30,650
This snake is so funny.

2962
02:43:31,730 --> 02:43:32,470
Oh my god.

2963
02:43:32,490 --> 02:43:34,010
This is the original camera angle.

2964
02:43:35,050 --> 02:43:35,530
Horrible.

2965
02:43:36,610 --> 02:43:37,090
Horrible.

2966
02:43:37,630 --> 02:43:38,110
Horrible.

2967
02:43:38,130 --> 02:43:38,550
Horrible.

2968
02:43:38,550 --> 02:43:40,250
I never would have known that there was a guy there.

2969
02:43:44,680 --> 02:43:45,740
I love Minto.

2970
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:47,960
Okay, I hear someone walking.

2971
02:43:48,060 --> 02:43:48,780
Quite fast.

2972
02:43:54,900 --> 02:43:56,220
I think he's coming down.

2973
02:43:56,600 --> 02:43:56,920
Ah!

2974
02:43:56,920 --> 02:43:59,020
Are you for real?

2975
02:43:59,100 --> 02:43:59,940
You circled me.

2976
02:43:59,940 --> 02:44:01,560
You circled me this entire time.

2977
02:44:01,660 --> 02:44:04,160
You circled me this entire time.

2978
02:44:04,220 --> 02:44:05,700
And then you decide to bite me!

2979
02:44:11,880 --> 02:44:12,420
Asshole.

2980
02:44:26,740 --> 02:44:27,840
Oh my gosh.

2981
02:44:28,440 --> 02:44:28,980
Okay.

2982
02:44:29,740 --> 02:44:30,580
Alright guys.

2983
02:44:31,460 --> 02:44:33,040
There might be some death here.

2984
02:44:34,580 --> 02:44:36,820
So, let me try also this.

2985
02:44:37,460 --> 02:44:37,900
Um...

2986
02:44:39,500 --> 02:44:40,100
Let's see.

2987
02:44:41,160 --> 02:44:43,200
Okay, we have the cigar gas spray.

2988
02:44:43,240 --> 02:44:43,980
If I can use it.

2989
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:45,240
How do I use it again?

2990
02:44:45,340 --> 02:44:45,780
Let me check.

2991
02:44:48,520 --> 02:44:48,960
Um...

2992
02:44:52,020 --> 02:44:53,380
Just square to hold.

2993
02:44:53,680 --> 02:44:54,120
Okay.

2994
02:44:56,280 --> 02:44:57,200
Betrayed by the circle.

2995
02:44:57,280 --> 02:44:58,000
Snake circle.

2996
02:44:58,300 --> 02:44:58,960
Oh, the irony.

2997
02:44:58,960 --> 02:44:59,740
Like...

2998
02:44:59,740 --> 02:45:00,980
What a jerk.

2999
02:45:01,380 --> 02:45:03,000
And let's um...

3000
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:03,220
Okay.

3001
02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:07,120
Instead of a big shooty weapon.

3002
02:45:07,640 --> 02:45:08,940
Let's do...

3003
02:45:08,940 --> 02:45:12,220
Some maybe smoke grenades.

3004
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:13,320
And instead of...

3005
02:45:13,320 --> 02:45:14,200
I'll put away the TNT.

3006
02:45:14,300 --> 02:45:16,520
Let's put a book.

3007
02:45:16,920 --> 02:45:17,840
Let's grab a book.

3008
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:23,240
Yeah.

3009
02:45:23,380 --> 02:45:26,020
Maybe some more distraction stuff.

3010
02:45:26,160 --> 02:45:27,780
Than actual...

3011
02:45:30,940 --> 02:45:32,180
Than actual...

3012
02:45:32,180 --> 02:45:32,900
You know...

3013
02:45:35,880 --> 02:45:36,500
Uh...

3014
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:37,680
Uh...

3015
02:45:39,640 --> 02:45:40,260
Okay.

3016
02:45:40,340 --> 02:45:41,040
I think he's downstairs.

3017
02:45:41,820 --> 02:45:42,680
Never mind.

3018
02:45:42,720 --> 02:45:43,280
He's right there.

3019
02:45:44,840 --> 02:45:45,460
Uh...

3020
02:45:45,460 --> 02:45:47,380
I think he goes downstairs.

3021
02:45:55,220 --> 02:45:56,830
I do have good camo.

3022
02:45:57,570 --> 02:45:58,370
At least.

3023
02:45:59,410 --> 02:46:00,370
Go down!

3024
02:46:00,550 --> 02:46:01,250
Go down!

3025
02:46:04,670 --> 02:46:05,770
Leave this place.

3026
02:46:08,130 --> 02:46:09,030
What stairs?

3027
02:46:09,290 --> 02:46:09,850
You know what I mean.

3028
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:15,280
We're at 90% camo.

3029
02:46:17,180 --> 02:46:18,940
We're pretty good.

3030
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:19,760
We're pretty good.

3031
02:46:19,760 --> 02:46:19,840
We're pretty good.

3032
02:46:22,020 --> 02:46:22,620
We're pretty good.

3033
02:46:22,620 --> 02:46:23,480
I hate this part.

3034
02:46:23,780 --> 02:46:25,080
Gosh, I hate this part.

3035
02:46:25,260 --> 02:46:26,580
I hate this part.

3036
02:46:30,720 --> 02:46:32,920
What's worse is it's so long even.

3037
02:46:32,980 --> 02:46:33,320
What's worse is it's so long even.

3038
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:33,660
What's worse is it's so long even.

3039
02:46:35,060 --> 02:46:37,440
But we get a sexy time with Eva it's worth.

3040
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:39,680
Just think of the sexy Eva.

3041
02:46:40,380 --> 02:46:41,800
Sexy Eva coming up.

3042
02:46:51,210 --> 02:46:52,270
Gonna have...

3043
02:46:52,890 --> 02:46:54,290
This on the ready.

3044
02:46:55,110 --> 02:46:56,110
Just in case.

3045
02:47:07,630 --> 02:47:08,370
Back down.

3046
02:47:09,170 --> 02:47:09,730
Alright.

3047
02:47:10,070 --> 02:47:11,430
Slow and steady everybody.

3048
02:47:13,910 --> 02:47:15,030
Wait for...

3049
02:47:15,030 --> 02:47:16,390
I hear the...

3050
02:47:16,390 --> 02:47:17,090
I hear him.

3051
02:47:20,790 --> 02:47:22,290
Eyes on the prize.

3052
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:24,750
Eyes on the prize.

3053
02:47:25,230 --> 02:47:25,330
Eyes on the prize.

3054
02:47:29,390 --> 02:47:31,390
Actually I'm gonna get closer to the wall.

3055
02:47:31,790 --> 02:47:32,690
There we go.

3056
02:47:35,210 --> 02:47:35,850
No.

3057
02:47:36,850 --> 02:47:37,490
Shaw.

3058
02:47:44,070 --> 02:47:44,710
Okay.

3059
02:47:44,870 --> 02:47:46,590
Why can't you give me anymore?

3060
02:47:48,410 --> 02:47:49,050
Please.

3061
02:47:51,930 --> 02:47:54,270
Why no more tranq ammo please?

3062
02:47:55,150 --> 02:47:55,970
Why no more tranq ammo please?

3063
02:48:01,100 --> 02:48:02,800
You know what would enhance this camouflage?

3064
02:48:03,080 --> 02:48:03,860
Crocodile cam.

3065
02:48:06,020 --> 02:48:07,140
So true.

3066
02:48:07,360 --> 02:48:08,060
So true.

3067
02:48:11,740 --> 02:48:14,600
So did these guys come out instead of the helicopter?

3068
02:48:14,820 --> 02:48:15,600
Is that what that is?

3069
02:48:17,980 --> 02:48:19,760
No one would expect a...

3070
02:48:22,520 --> 02:48:23,800
I can't remember.

3071
02:48:25,300 --> 02:48:26,960
Where this guy is.

3072
02:48:28,900 --> 02:48:30,180
I'm just gonna go for it.

3073
02:48:35,820 --> 02:48:36,600
Oh my god.

3074
02:48:37,420 --> 02:48:38,540
I think I hear him.

3075
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:39,840
Do I hear him?

3076
02:48:40,600 --> 02:48:42,020
I mean I definitely hear him.

3077
02:48:42,100 --> 02:48:42,780
Is he coming up?

3078
02:48:43,120 --> 02:48:44,360
Oh there he is.

3079
02:48:44,440 --> 02:48:45,080
Oh my god.

3080
02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:49,280
Try with the OG camera.

3081
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:51,300
Oh my gosh.

3082
02:48:51,340 --> 02:48:52,680
It's so good here actually.

3083
02:48:56,340 --> 02:48:57,900
It's so good here actually.

3084
02:49:00,180 --> 02:49:01,900
OG camera my beloved.

3085
02:49:04,260 --> 02:49:05,300
He's going up.

3086
02:49:05,540 --> 02:49:05,780
He's going up.

3087
02:49:09,810 --> 02:49:10,170
Huh.

3088
02:49:11,590 --> 02:49:12,830
I want to get into that hole.

3089
02:49:20,740 --> 02:49:22,460
I can't tell if he can see me or not.

3090
02:49:22,600 --> 02:49:23,840
I'm gonna wait for him to go back down.

3091
02:49:26,860 --> 02:49:27,980
I never thought about this.

3092
02:49:28,100 --> 02:49:30,080
Well you wouldn't be able to use it.

3093
02:49:31,660 --> 02:49:33,420
Unless you were playing subsistence.

3094
02:49:33,680 --> 02:49:34,760
Because they took it out.

3095
02:49:43,900 --> 02:49:44,660
Hold on.

3096
02:49:45,540 --> 02:49:46,400
Where does this go?

3097
02:49:46,680 --> 02:49:47,560
Why am I going down?

3098
02:49:48,560 --> 02:49:48,860
Um.

3099
02:49:50,580 --> 02:49:51,160
Wait a second.

3100
02:49:51,320 --> 02:49:51,820
Why am I?

3101
02:49:51,960 --> 02:49:53,060
Where am I?

3102
02:49:53,800 --> 02:49:55,120
Is there anything down here?

3103
02:49:57,800 --> 02:49:58,560
Never mind.

3104
02:49:59,580 --> 02:50:00,160
Turn around.

3105
02:50:00,700 --> 02:50:01,220
I think.

3106
02:50:15,750 --> 02:50:16,470
I'm just gonna go.

3107
02:50:18,510 --> 02:50:19,450
Where is the other guy?

3108
02:50:21,990 --> 02:50:23,190
Where did he go?

3109
02:50:26,740 --> 02:50:28,760
Where did he go?

3110
02:50:28,760 --> 02:50:33,140
Oh my gosh.

3111
02:50:33,320 --> 02:50:34,280
Where were you?

3112
02:50:36,400 --> 02:50:38,540
I need to go.

3113
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:40,420
Oh god.

3114
02:50:46,240 --> 02:50:48,560
Which direction is the correct direction?

3115
02:50:49,060 --> 02:50:52,480
Which direction is the correct direction?

3116
02:50:55,630 --> 02:50:57,450
I hear another person walking.

3117
02:50:57,770 --> 02:50:59,290
Maybe it's the guy down here.

3118
02:50:59,370 --> 02:50:59,790
I can't tell.

3119
02:51:01,650 --> 02:51:02,890
Turn around.

3120
02:51:04,010 --> 02:51:09,730
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely And you're never coming round.

3121
02:51:10,640 --> 02:51:11,630
Turn around.

3122
02:51:12,830 --> 02:51:16,290
Every now and then I get a little bit tired.

3123
02:51:16,750 --> 02:51:18,630
Listening to the sound of my...

3124
02:51:18,630 --> 02:51:19,570
Oh there he is.

3125
02:51:20,110 --> 02:51:21,270
Turn around.

3126
02:51:21,270 --> 02:51:21,390
Turn around.

3127
02:51:26,330 --> 02:51:26,850
Oh.

3128
02:51:27,730 --> 02:51:28,250
Lame.

3129
02:51:32,960 --> 02:51:34,880
I think I have to run past this guy.

3130
02:51:36,420 --> 02:51:36,940
Um.

3131
02:51:38,860 --> 02:51:41,480
Once he turns around again, we'll go.

3132
02:51:42,080 --> 02:51:45,420
He stays looking the other direction for quite some time, so.

3133
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:50,660
Every now and then I And I'm gonna go up that way.

3134
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:51,520
Fall apart.

3135
02:51:53,160 --> 02:51:55,760
And I need you now tonight.

3136
02:51:57,660 --> 02:52:00,920
And I need you more than ever.

3137
02:52:01,620 --> 02:52:02,300
And I need you more than ever.

3138
02:52:02,300 --> 02:52:02,360
And I need you more than ever.

3139
02:52:05,370 --> 02:52:07,330
I can't tell how far he can see.

3140
02:52:07,770 --> 02:52:09,270
If I'm like around a...

3141
02:52:09,270 --> 02:52:10,190
Oh yeah.

3142
02:52:11,630 --> 02:52:12,430
Oh my gosh.

3143
02:52:12,770 --> 02:52:13,250
Mixing.

3144
02:52:18,550 --> 02:52:20,390
Mixing the camera angles is kind of amazing.

3145
02:52:20,870 --> 02:52:20,990
Mixing the camera angles is kind of amazing.

3146
02:52:38,920 --> 02:52:39,400
Alright.

3147
02:52:39,480 --> 02:52:40,780
Time to be careful here a little bit.

3148
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:43,080
We don't want...

3149
02:52:43,800 --> 02:52:44,280
Okay.

3150
02:52:44,580 --> 02:52:45,520
Maybe he won't see me.

3151
02:52:46,240 --> 02:52:46,720
Phew.

3152
02:52:48,600 --> 02:52:49,620
Guys, we're so stealthy.

3153
02:52:51,360 --> 02:52:52,800
Please sing that song next karaoke.

3154
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:53,340
Okay.

3155
02:52:57,440 --> 02:52:59,720
Stupid Fiber One commercial ruined the song for me.

3156
02:52:59,880 --> 02:53:00,880
Wait, what are you talking about?

3157
02:53:02,240 --> 02:53:03,320
You watch commercials?

3158
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:07,340
I don't know the last time I watched TV.

3159
02:53:23,940 --> 02:53:27,460
I don't know if he'll see me or not, but...

3160
02:53:38,860 --> 02:53:39,920
No, I went the wrong way.

3161
02:53:41,280 --> 02:53:41,640
Haha!

3162
02:53:45,570 --> 02:53:45,930
No.

3163
02:53:51,480 --> 02:53:52,740
Can I fall from here?

3164
02:53:52,880 --> 02:53:53,620
I can fall from here.

3165
02:53:55,540 --> 02:53:56,680
I can fall from here!

3166
02:53:58,020 --> 02:53:58,560
Right game?

3167
02:54:01,020 --> 02:54:01,380
Game.

3168
02:54:01,540 --> 02:54:02,520
I can fall from here, right?

3169
02:54:02,680 --> 02:54:05,520
They won't hear me if I shoot it, will they?

3170
02:54:08,420 --> 02:54:10,940
If I shoot the Mosin, will they hear me?

3171
02:54:11,100 --> 02:54:12,320
Oh, I forgot I put it away.

3172
02:54:16,480 --> 02:54:19,780
Son, you've got a way to fall.

3173
02:54:20,180 --> 02:54:20,380
Son, you've got a way to fall.

3174
02:54:20,380 --> 02:54:20,440
Son, you've got a way to fall.

3175
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:26,760
The Mosin isn't silent.

3176
02:54:33,340 --> 02:54:34,740
I wouldn't risk it, personally.

3177
02:54:35,940 --> 02:54:36,500
I wouldn't risk it, personally.

3178
02:54:37,220 --> 02:54:37,980
It's loud.

3179
02:54:39,380 --> 02:54:40,880
I don't trust it.

3180
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:42,740
I don't trust it, either.

3181
02:54:43,020 --> 02:54:43,040
I don't trust it, either.

3182
02:54:47,440 --> 02:54:49,400
How do I get past these guys, though?

3183
02:54:49,880 --> 02:54:52,520
How do I get past these guys, though?

3184
02:54:52,520 --> 02:54:53,700
Let me change it to my next...

3185
02:54:53,700 --> 02:54:55,400
My sunny camouflage.

3186
02:54:55,520 --> 02:54:57,480
But then they'll see me for sure, 100%.

3187
02:54:59,020 --> 02:54:59,820
Let's eat...

3188
02:54:59,820 --> 02:55:00,840
a rabbit.

3189
02:55:01,740 --> 02:55:02,340
Not bad.

3190
02:55:04,380 --> 02:55:05,180
Pretty tasty.

3191
02:55:08,080 --> 02:55:10,320
Throw a chaff beforehand so they don't hear the shot.

3192
02:55:11,960 --> 02:55:14,020
I don't even want to...

3193
02:55:14,020 --> 02:55:14,960
Oh, Sig spray them.

3194
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:15,260
So true.

3195
02:55:15,480 --> 02:55:16,820
I don't even wanna...

3196
02:55:18,080 --> 02:55:20,440
do like... I don't wanna...

3197
02:55:20,440 --> 02:55:22,020
Where is that thing, anyway?

3198
02:55:22,200 --> 02:55:23,120
Can it see me from here?

3199
02:55:24,900 --> 02:55:27,040
I don't wanna go into alert mode at all, honestly.

3200
02:55:28,500 --> 02:55:28,860
Okay.

3201
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:31,240
Oh my god, he's moving.

3202
02:55:32,560 --> 02:55:33,400
Where'd the other guy go?

3203
02:55:33,800 --> 02:55:34,640
Oh, there he is.

3204
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:39,460
Gosh, I was just about to drop down.

3205
02:55:39,540 --> 02:55:41,920
If I had, this guy would've walked right up on me.

3206
02:55:43,480 --> 02:55:44,040
Okay, there.

3207
02:55:44,180 --> 02:55:45,200
I don't think he'll be able to see me.

3208
02:55:45,300 --> 02:55:45,560
Cool.

3209
02:55:47,160 --> 02:55:48,100
Where are you going?

3210
02:55:48,100 --> 02:55:48,140
Where are you going?

3211
02:55:51,440 --> 02:55:54,980
Oh, I don't know if Woodland's the best camo, you're right, for my face.

3212
02:55:57,220 --> 02:55:59,120
Guys, I'm at 95%.

3213
02:55:59,120 --> 02:55:59,760
That's crazy.

3214
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:01,480
Crazy.

3215
02:56:01,500 --> 02:56:02,780
And I'm an animal.

3216
02:56:05,760 --> 02:56:07,020
I'm practically invisible.

3217
02:56:11,920 --> 02:56:14,500
Alright, once this guy turns around, we'll drop and...

3218
02:56:14,500 --> 02:56:16,280
I'll cigarette him.

3219
02:56:17,400 --> 02:56:19,660
I have to do it to their face though, right?

3220
02:56:19,940 --> 02:56:20,420
Like...

3221
02:56:29,410 --> 02:56:30,730
You have to be pretty close.

3222
02:56:44,930 --> 02:56:46,110
Maybe when he comes...

3223
02:56:46,110 --> 02:56:47,070
Oh my god, who saw me?

3224
02:56:48,670 --> 02:56:49,390
Who went, hmm?

3225
02:56:50,070 --> 02:56:50,850
Or am I crazy?

3226
02:56:52,550 --> 02:56:53,090
Maybe not.

3227
02:56:53,250 --> 02:56:53,590
Just kidding.

3228
02:56:54,910 --> 02:56:55,890
CQC slam him?

3229
02:56:58,570 --> 02:56:58,930
Yeah...

3230
02:56:58,930 --> 02:56:59,990
That is an option.

3231
02:57:09,330 --> 02:57:10,470
It does work from behind, though.

3232
02:57:10,490 --> 02:57:10,950
Okay, cool.

3233
02:57:12,430 --> 02:57:13,590
I don't think I've ever used...

3234
02:57:13,590 --> 02:57:14,730
I think I've used it like once before.

3235
02:57:15,670 --> 02:57:16,710
So I don't quite remember.

3236
02:57:18,750 --> 02:57:20,150
Is there a snake around here?

3237
02:57:25,530 --> 02:57:26,910
Okay, let's just keep moving.

3238
02:57:36,260 --> 02:57:38,340
He's gonna come down like any second though, right?

3239
02:57:40,040 --> 02:57:41,120
Yeah, here he comes.

3240
02:57:41,800 --> 02:57:42,880
We'll get this guy first.

3241
02:57:44,140 --> 02:57:44,540
Wait!

3242
02:57:44,780 --> 02:57:45,260
I know.

3243
02:57:53,990 --> 02:57:54,350
What

3244
02:58:08,870 --> 02:58:09,830
do we have here?

3245
02:58:22,920 --> 02:58:24,460
Can I get my book back, or...

3246
02:58:26,200 --> 02:58:26,560
Lucky.

3247
02:58:29,080 --> 02:58:30,380
I think I saw something.

3248
02:58:30,580 --> 02:58:31,060
Did you?

3249
02:58:31,240 --> 02:58:32,040
Come here, come here.

3250
02:58:32,140 --> 02:58:33,420
Come check it out, come check it out.

3251
02:58:35,060 --> 02:58:36,620
Oh, I guess I'm seeing things.

3252
02:58:36,900 --> 02:58:37,280
Oh yeah.

3253
02:58:45,440 --> 02:58:46,060
Turn around!

3254
02:58:49,280 --> 02:58:49,640
Turn around!

3255
02:58:49,640 --> 02:58:50,680
Turn around!

3256
02:58:54,340 --> 02:58:55,960
I wish I could get my book back.

3257
02:58:58,240 --> 02:58:58,800
Oh.

3258
02:59:12,100 --> 02:59:12,720
We're fine.

3259
02:59:14,280 --> 02:59:15,460
Nobody else is coming.

3260
02:59:17,400 --> 02:59:18,220
Oh, shoot.

3261
02:59:48,810 --> 02:59:51,670
Why is there a whole ass alarm, huh?

3262
02:59:53,350 --> 02:59:55,690
Why is there a whole ass alarm going off?

3263
02:59:55,950 --> 02:59:56,030
Why is there a whole ass alarm going off?

3264
02:59:57,050 --> 02:59:57,610
Why is there a whole ass alarm going off?

3265
02:59:57,750 --> 02:59:58,450
Oh my god.

3266
02:59:59,190 --> 02:59:59,510
Where?

3267
02:59:59,570 --> 02:59:59,850
Where?

3268
03:00:00,010 --> 03:00:00,170
Where?

3269
03:00:01,050 --> 03:00:01,730
Throwing stuff at me.

3270
03:00:04,630 --> 03:00:04,950
Uh...

3271
03:00:06,290 --> 03:00:06,610
Hmm...

3272
03:00:07,330 --> 03:00:07,750
Owl-cha!

3273
03:00:10,890 --> 03:00:11,410
Come inside.

3274
03:00:14,070 --> 03:00:14,390
Whoopsie.

3275
03:00:14,390 --> 03:00:15,190
I pressed the wrong button.

3276
03:00:18,290 --> 03:00:18,610
Snake.

3277
03:00:18,610 --> 03:00:19,930
I don't think we're gonna make it, Snake.

3278
03:00:20,130 --> 03:00:20,910
I hate this part.

3279
03:00:21,150 --> 03:00:22,390
Am I gonna have to do this all over again?

3280
03:00:22,430 --> 03:00:22,930
Please, no!

3281
03:00:23,630 --> 03:00:24,670
Please, I'd rather die!

3282
03:00:25,570 --> 03:00:27,330
Please don't make me do it all over again!

3283
03:00:28,210 --> 03:00:28,650
Please!

3284
03:00:30,490 --> 03:00:30,930
Uh...

3285
03:00:30,930 --> 03:00:33,770
Maybe I should just go to the next area and die.

3286
03:00:34,990 --> 03:00:35,430
Hmm...

3287
03:00:35,430 --> 03:00:37,210
Let's go to the next area and die.

3288
03:00:38,150 --> 03:00:38,810
Oh my gosh.

3289
03:00:38,950 --> 03:00:39,610
Bye-bye!

3290
03:00:39,730 --> 03:00:39,990
Bye!

3291
03:00:44,730 --> 03:00:45,790
Go to the next area!

3292
03:00:46,830 --> 03:00:47,850
If I die, I die!

3293
03:00:48,830 --> 03:00:53,030
Because I can't go into the next room with Eva unless there's not an alert.

3294
03:00:58,670 --> 03:01:00,630
I just have to kill everybody, I guess.

3295
03:01:01,090 --> 03:01:01,530
Hahaha.

3296
03:01:03,310 --> 03:01:05,190
What if I box, like, right here?

3297
03:01:05,350 --> 03:01:06,010
Do you think they notice?

3298
03:01:06,190 --> 03:01:06,530
Oh!

3299
03:01:06,710 --> 03:01:07,570
I got a new uniform.

3300
03:01:14,370 --> 03:01:15,250
Urban environment.

3301
03:01:15,510 --> 03:01:15,910
Nice.

3302
03:01:16,470 --> 03:01:16,910
Um...

3303
03:01:18,070 --> 03:01:20,110
Anyway, so I started blasting.

3304
03:01:22,410 --> 03:01:22,850
Uh...

3305
03:01:24,210 --> 03:01:24,650
Hmm...

3306
03:01:25,430 --> 03:01:26,550
How do I want to do this?

3307
03:01:26,710 --> 03:01:27,810
How do I want to do this?

3308
03:01:27,910 --> 03:01:28,210
Maybe...

3309
03:01:28,210 --> 03:01:29,990
Smoke grenade, box.

3310
03:01:32,130 --> 03:01:32,570
Foolproof.

3311
03:01:33,930 --> 03:01:34,390
Right!

3312
03:01:37,810 --> 03:01:38,390
Oh, wait.

3313
03:01:38,710 --> 03:01:39,450
I had it.

3314
03:01:39,530 --> 03:01:39,990
Okay, never mind.

3315
03:01:46,440 --> 03:01:47,600
Where's my smoke grenade?

3316
03:01:47,660 --> 03:01:47,940
There we go.

3317
03:01:55,780 --> 03:01:56,500
That's stupid.

3318
03:02:00,710 --> 03:02:03,570
They're shooting, but do they know what they're talking...

3319
03:02:04,210 --> 03:02:04,670
about?

3320
03:02:05,510 --> 03:02:06,170
Oh my god.

3321
03:02:08,710 --> 03:02:10,550
Do they even know what they're talking about?

3322
03:02:11,070 --> 03:02:11,530
Hahaha.

3323
03:02:11,530 --> 03:02:11,690
Hahaha.

3324
03:02:13,850 --> 03:02:15,730
We're suffering from severe burns, dude.

3325
03:02:15,830 --> 03:02:16,630
This is so bad.

3326
03:02:18,090 --> 03:02:19,070
Um, what else do I need?

3327
03:02:19,890 --> 03:02:20,330
Bandage.

3328
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:41,620
If you lie down, they won't find you?

3329
03:02:41,720 --> 03:02:42,460
Oh, that's true, right?

3330
03:02:43,600 --> 03:02:45,000
Because I'm at 95 camo?

3331
03:02:45,900 --> 03:02:46,600
That's so true.

3332
03:02:47,520 --> 03:02:48,780
I boxed out of fear.

3333
03:02:49,120 --> 03:02:49,560
Hahaha.

3334
03:02:51,740 --> 03:02:54,160
I boxed out of what felt like a necessity.

3335
03:02:54,820 --> 03:02:55,580
Let me eat.

3336
03:02:58,600 --> 03:03:00,300
Let's have a little snack while we wait.

3337
03:03:00,400 --> 03:03:01,440
Oh, it's supposed to taste great!

3338
03:03:06,400 --> 03:03:06,840
Nice.

3339
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:10,080
Yeah, that's my safety box, for real.

3340
03:03:11,860 --> 03:03:12,720
We're evading.

3341
03:03:12,840 --> 03:03:13,360
We're evading.

3342
03:03:13,400 --> 03:03:13,860
We're evading.

3343
03:03:14,060 --> 03:03:15,000
Let's get rid of the...

3344
03:03:17,480 --> 03:03:18,300
We're in caution.

3345
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:29,400
Gosh.

3346
03:03:31,340 --> 03:03:32,720
I hate the mountains!

3347
03:03:34,980 --> 03:03:36,620
I hate the mountains so much.

3348
03:03:36,820 --> 03:03:37,820
Nice camera angle.

3349
03:03:46,420 --> 03:03:48,600
I hear footsteps, but I can't...

3350
03:03:48,600 --> 03:03:49,360
Actually...

3351
03:03:49,360 --> 03:03:52,460
Wait, my camo is not even that great right here.

3352
03:03:52,940 --> 03:03:53,840
I just noticed.

3353
03:03:56,640 --> 03:03:57,600
Okay, there we go.

3354
03:03:57,700 --> 03:03:58,720
Now my camo is good.

3355
03:04:03,540 --> 03:04:04,480
Don't see me!

3356
03:04:33,790 --> 03:04:35,010
What's the regular...

3357
03:04:36,990 --> 03:04:38,210
old camera angle?

3358
03:04:38,710 --> 03:04:39,390
It's okay.

3359
03:04:40,810 --> 03:04:41,650
Not the best here though.

3360
03:04:51,540 --> 03:04:52,860
Gosh, there's so many guys!

3361
03:04:54,380 --> 03:04:56,900
This part sucks so much.

3362
03:05:02,240 --> 03:05:04,380
This part sucks so much.

3363
03:05:04,600 --> 03:05:04,780
This part sucks so much.

3364
03:05:04,920 --> 03:05:05,560
This part sucks so much.

3365
03:05:05,560 --> 03:05:06,580
To the trench of safety.

3366
03:05:06,740 --> 03:05:08,340
I don't know about that!

3367
03:05:11,580 --> 03:05:13,420
I don't know about that!

3368
03:05:13,420 --> 03:05:14,720
I don't know about that.

3369
03:05:26,860 --> 03:05:28,440
The pre-dug grave.

3370
03:05:28,760 --> 03:05:31,800
We have to go up to that building right up there.

3371
03:05:32,060 --> 03:05:32,540
Right?

3372
03:05:32,660 --> 03:05:34,040
That's the one with Eva in it, right?

3373
03:05:34,360 --> 03:05:35,280
Let me call her.

3374
03:05:36,200 --> 03:05:36,680
Eva?

3375
03:05:37,040 --> 03:05:38,040
Eva, help me, please.

3376
03:05:38,980 --> 03:05:40,440
You made it to the mountains.

3377
03:05:40,920 --> 03:05:41,420
Yeah, somehow.

3378
03:05:41,740 --> 03:05:44,220
Those mountains are known as Krasnogorye.

3379
03:05:44,400 --> 03:05:47,200
The name means the Red Mountain Ridge in Russian.

3380
03:05:47,880 --> 03:05:53,040
The entire range has been fortified to act as a defense for the great fortress of Krasnogorye.

3381
03:05:53,880 --> 03:05:57,160
The area near the top has been dug with bunkers and trenches.

3382
03:05:57,500 --> 03:06:00,320
And there are anti-aircraft gun emplacements everywhere.

3383
03:06:01,380 --> 03:06:03,800
It's literally an impenetrable wall.

3384
03:06:04,100 --> 03:06:05,200
Proceed with caution.

3385
03:06:05,720 --> 03:06:07,100
Oh, it's further up, okay.

3386
03:06:07,120 --> 03:06:09,380
There's a provision storehouse in the hillside area.

3387
03:06:09,620 --> 03:06:11,620
And there's an armory at the summit.

3388
03:06:11,620 --> 03:06:12,600
Oh, maybe I saw the armory.

3389
03:06:12,860 --> 03:06:15,220
I'll meet you in the ruins at the top of the mountains.

3390
03:06:15,580 --> 03:06:16,720
Maybe that's the armory.

3391
03:06:16,820 --> 03:06:18,000
See those ruins at the summit?

3392
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:19,560
I'll be waiting for you there.

3393
03:06:19,880 --> 03:06:20,440
Yes.

3394
03:06:26,620 --> 03:06:27,300
Let's see.

3395
03:06:30,420 --> 03:06:32,040
Oh my goodness.

3396
03:06:32,760 --> 03:06:34,120
Eva, you're so far away.

3397
03:06:35,400 --> 03:06:35,980
Eva.

3398
03:06:36,560 --> 03:06:37,140
Eva.

3399
03:06:37,760 --> 03:06:39,400
Why you gotta do this to me?

3400
03:06:46,990 --> 03:06:51,130
Guys, somehow we survived.

3401
03:06:52,450 --> 03:06:54,090
Metal Gear survived real.

3402
03:06:56,430 --> 03:06:58,530
If I go in here though...

3403
03:07:01,610 --> 03:07:05,050
I wonder if it will be... maybe... okay.

3404
03:07:05,190 --> 03:07:06,230
This might be stupid.

3405
03:07:06,530 --> 03:07:09,430
I might be a fool everybody, but I'm going in.

3406
03:07:09,930 --> 03:07:10,970
I'm going in!

3407
03:07:11,670 --> 03:07:13,330
I'm going into the trenches!

3408
03:07:14,550 --> 03:07:15,650
I might be dumb.

3409
03:07:23,780 --> 03:07:25,740
They won't see me down here.

3410
03:07:27,300 --> 03:07:27,960
Will they?

3411
03:07:29,880 --> 03:07:31,320
If I'm wiggling.

3412
03:07:36,420 --> 03:07:36,860
Yeah.

3413
03:07:37,060 --> 03:07:37,400
Yeah.

3414
03:07:42,380 --> 03:07:42,820
Helicopter.

3415
03:07:49,780 --> 03:07:50,580
Where is he?

3416
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:51,180
Where'd he go?

3417
03:07:52,300 --> 03:07:53,480
Just hug the wall.

3418
03:07:53,840 --> 03:07:54,780
Go to the wall.

3419
03:07:56,520 --> 03:07:56,960
Okay.

3420
03:07:59,920 --> 03:08:00,520
Might be.

3421
03:08:00,700 --> 03:08:01,140
Hey.

3422
03:08:02,960 --> 03:08:07,180
I know it says 95%, but I just don't trust it.

3423
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:09,220
Rather, I don't trust me.

3424
03:08:10,980 --> 03:08:12,080
I don't trust me.

3425
03:08:13,640 --> 03:08:16,700
So that's where my worries lie.

3426
03:08:19,660 --> 03:08:20,230
...

3427
03:08:20,800 --> 03:08:21,640
...

3428
03:08:23,360 --> 03:08:24,500
...

3429
03:08:24,500 --> 03:08:25,100
...

3430
03:08:26,080 --> 03:08:31,400
I'm sensing some PTSD from this corner in particular.

3431
03:08:38,120 --> 03:08:38,690
...

3432
03:08:39,260 --> 03:08:40,120
...

3433
03:08:40,120 --> 03:08:40,620
...

3434
03:08:43,760 --> 03:08:45,300
You gnome with the PTSD?

3435
03:08:49,760 --> 03:08:50,720
Do you know?

3436
03:08:51,600 --> 03:08:52,500
Do you know?

3437
03:08:55,180 --> 03:08:56,000
Oh gosh.

3438
03:08:57,980 --> 03:08:59,900
I don't know if I'm ready to fight the fury.

3439
03:09:02,760 --> 03:09:04,120
Well I have to get there first.

3440
03:09:05,100 --> 03:09:05,600
Where

3441
03:09:15,800 --> 03:09:16,160
am I?

3442
03:09:16,400 --> 03:09:18,360
Where am I?

3443
03:09:33,340 --> 03:09:33,580
I'm so lost.

3444
03:09:36,160 --> 03:09:38,800
I wish I could zoom in even more.

3445
03:09:46,610 --> 03:09:49,590
At least you're not escorting five prisoners.

3446
03:09:50,970 --> 03:09:52,170
Oh child.

3447
03:09:52,630 --> 03:09:53,670
Prisoners in five.

3448
03:09:55,430 --> 03:09:59,010
What are you talking about?

3449
03:09:59,190 --> 03:10:00,390
I love escort missions.

3450
03:10:04,660 --> 03:10:06,340
You don't like escort missions?

3451
03:10:06,420 --> 03:10:07,220
What's wrong with you?

3452
03:10:07,620 --> 03:10:09,040
Let's go this way and just see where it takes us.

3453
03:10:12,590 --> 03:10:14,250
Into the hole we go.

3454
03:10:15,370 --> 03:10:17,010
Into the hole we go.

3455
03:10:23,160 --> 03:10:24,220
I hear somebody.

3456
03:10:34,550 --> 03:10:35,750
Maybe around this way.

3457
03:10:38,710 --> 03:10:39,330
Let's see.

3458
03:10:39,570 --> 03:10:41,410
If I go around...

3459
03:10:46,400 --> 03:10:46,900
So...

3460
03:10:49,340 --> 03:10:51,060
Maybe I just keep following the trench.

3461
03:10:52,540 --> 03:10:54,280
Up around this building.

3462
03:10:55,180 --> 03:10:56,520
And I can make it.

3463
03:11:00,560 --> 03:11:01,920
Very snaky.

3464
03:11:04,680 --> 03:11:06,040
Very snaky.

3465
03:11:11,220 --> 03:11:16,650
I hear someone on my left.

3466
03:11:27,150 --> 03:11:28,210
Oh there he is.

3467
03:11:28,310 --> 03:11:28,450
Okay.

3468
03:11:32,550 --> 03:11:33,490
Hug the wall.

3469
03:11:33,810 --> 03:11:34,450
Oh my god.

3470
03:11:35,810 --> 03:11:36,370
Never mind.

3471
03:11:36,570 --> 03:11:37,450
I'm gonna wait.

3472
03:11:37,550 --> 03:11:38,450
I'm gonna wait it out.

3473
03:11:41,130 --> 03:11:42,330
I'm gonna wait it out.

3474
03:11:43,990 --> 03:11:45,970
The end is coming to a close you guys.

3475
03:11:48,090 --> 03:11:49,110
Wait does he come in here?

3476
03:11:49,610 --> 03:11:50,230
Oh shit.

3477
03:11:50,870 --> 03:11:51,670
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3478
03:11:52,150 --> 03:11:52,890
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3479
03:11:53,970 --> 03:11:54,830
You come in here?

3480
03:11:56,250 --> 03:11:56,710
You come in here?

3481
03:11:58,270 --> 03:11:59,270
No my hole.

3482
03:12:09,470 --> 03:12:10,210
Oh my god.

3483
03:12:10,330 --> 03:12:11,110
Oh my god.

3484
03:12:11,170 --> 03:12:11,870
Oh my god.

3485
03:12:11,950 --> 03:12:12,710
Oh my god.

3486
03:12:12,730 --> 03:12:13,170
Oh my god.

3487
03:12:13,190 --> 03:12:13,490
Oh my god.

3488
03:12:13,530 --> 03:12:13,810
Oh my god.

3489
03:12:13,970 --> 03:12:15,490
Oh my god.

3490
03:12:15,830 --> 03:12:16,790
Oh my god.

3491
03:12:16,930 --> 03:12:17,510
You guys.

3492
03:12:18,030 --> 03:12:18,770
You guys.

3493
03:12:19,210 --> 03:12:19,790
You guys.

3494
03:12:20,310 --> 03:12:20,710
Um...

3495
03:12:38,060 --> 03:12:39,380
I can't cigarette spray him.

3496
03:12:43,230 --> 03:12:44,090
Just gonna have to go.

3497
03:12:44,310 --> 03:12:44,930
Go snake.

3498
03:12:45,250 --> 03:12:45,810
Snake go.

3499
03:12:52,540 --> 03:12:53,820
Wait, am I going the right way?

3500
03:12:56,080 --> 03:12:57,380
I'm way further than I thought!

3501
03:12:58,580 --> 03:13:00,120
This map makes no sense to me.

3502
03:13:01,940 --> 03:13:03,420
Yeah, I'm out of mark 22 shots.

3503
03:13:03,580 --> 03:13:04,120
Yes I am.

3504
03:13:07,580 --> 03:13:08,700
I wish I could have...

3505
03:13:09,620 --> 03:13:11,000
I wish I could have just...

3506
03:13:14,180 --> 03:13:17,660
I wish I could have cigarette sprayed him afterwards, but it wouldn't let me.

3507
03:13:23,130 --> 03:13:24,210
He's gonna wake up.

3508
03:13:29,280 --> 03:13:29,780
Wait.

3509
03:13:30,880 --> 03:13:32,240
I don't want this guy seeing me.

3510
03:13:34,400 --> 03:13:35,580
Pick up up for loot!

3511
03:13:35,760 --> 03:13:37,320
I can't go back down!

3512
03:13:51,130 --> 03:13:52,330
Oh my god.

3513
03:13:53,830 --> 03:13:55,430
We made it!

3514
03:13:59,110 --> 03:14:00,110
Holy cow!

3515
03:14:00,270 --> 03:14:01,070
We made it!

3516
03:14:05,290 --> 03:14:08,810
Oh my god.

3517
03:14:14,630 --> 03:14:15,890
Time for Eva.

3518
03:14:16,410 --> 03:14:16,970
Hold on.

3519
03:14:17,010 --> 03:14:18,050
Let me eat a mint.

3520
03:14:32,450 --> 03:14:34,410
You look like you could use some rest.

3521
03:14:35,390 --> 03:14:36,090
Oh my god.

3522
03:14:36,110 --> 03:14:37,370
She looks naked from behind for real.

3523
03:14:37,410 --> 03:14:40,010
It's just that playing these two roles hasn't left me much time to sleep.

3524
03:14:40,550 --> 03:14:41,670
Where'd you get those cuts?

3525
03:14:43,050 --> 03:14:43,570
Colonel.

3526
03:14:43,570 --> 03:14:44,670
He found out?

3527
03:14:45,110 --> 03:14:46,830
If he knew I'd be dead already.

3528
03:14:47,190 --> 03:14:47,710
No.

3529
03:14:47,850 --> 03:14:48,970
This is his hobby.

3530
03:14:49,470 --> 03:14:50,510
He's a sadist.

3531
03:14:50,950 --> 03:14:53,290
He gets pleasure out of making people suffer.

3532
03:14:53,670 --> 03:14:54,610
He's scum.

3533
03:15:02,190 --> 03:15:04,290
Does it look that strange to you?

3534
03:15:05,190 --> 03:15:05,710
No.

3535
03:15:06,250 --> 03:15:07,370
I'm the same way.

3536
03:15:07,770 --> 03:15:08,790
Scars all over.

3537
03:15:09,330 --> 03:15:10,150
Can I see?

3538
03:15:10,310 --> 03:15:10,770
No.

3539
03:15:11,750 --> 03:15:12,270
So...

3540
03:15:15,310 --> 03:15:16,290
Where'd you get this one?

3541
03:15:16,310 --> 03:15:17,230
He's so fast.

3542
03:15:17,230 --> 03:15:18,890
I got it after defecting to the Soviet Union.

3543
03:15:19,070 --> 03:15:20,370
He's so fast.

3544
03:15:20,410 --> 03:15:20,970
I don't think so.

3545
03:15:21,190 --> 03:15:22,330
It's older than that.

3546
03:15:23,570 --> 03:15:25,150
Code breaking is a desk job.

3547
03:15:25,430 --> 03:15:26,710
Where'd you get this kind of scar?

3548
03:15:27,150 --> 03:15:28,050
You really wanna know?

3549
03:15:28,570 --> 03:15:30,110
You wanna know how I got these scars?

3550
03:15:30,990 --> 03:15:31,790
Well, too bad.

3551
03:15:34,970 --> 03:15:37,210
A girl's gotta have some secrets, you know.

3552
03:15:39,390 --> 03:15:40,730
But enough about that.

3553
03:15:40,870 --> 03:15:41,650
You've gotta get going.

3554
03:15:41,810 --> 03:15:44,090
The phase two trial of the shaggle hot is about to start.

3555
03:15:44,090 --> 03:15:46,570
And it looks like someone might be coming to spoil the party.

3556
03:15:46,650 --> 03:15:46,990
Uh oh.

3557
03:15:47,870 --> 03:15:48,270
Khrushchev?

3558
03:15:49,050 --> 03:15:50,710
His forces are on their way here.

3559
03:15:51,490 --> 03:15:54,110
The colonel is gathering his troops together to meet them.

3560
03:15:55,210 --> 03:15:58,530
If we don't get a move on, the security will be even tighter than it is now.

3561
03:15:58,530 --> 03:15:59,410
I should've been naked.

3562
03:15:59,610 --> 03:16:00,990
I should've taken off my animal print.

3563
03:16:02,190 --> 03:16:03,170
You'll need this key.

3564
03:16:03,390 --> 03:16:04,190
Oh, thank you.

3565
03:16:04,290 --> 03:16:06,230
It unlocks the door to the underground tunnel.

3566
03:16:06,510 --> 03:16:09,770
Once you're in there, you can follow the tunnel to get inside Grozengrad.

3567
03:16:09,770 --> 03:16:11,630
Snake really needs to learn how to pick locks.

3568
03:16:11,630 --> 03:16:13,010
And take this too.

3569
03:16:13,230 --> 03:16:15,890
Oh my gosh, ramen, my favorite.

3570
03:16:16,190 --> 03:16:17,050
What is it?

3571
03:16:17,330 --> 03:16:19,170
The food of the future.

3572
03:16:19,250 --> 03:16:21,510
A well-balanced meal for the space age.

3573
03:16:23,390 --> 03:16:25,470
It's good to eat some real food once in a while.

3574
03:16:25,610 --> 03:16:26,390
Space food.

3575
03:16:26,630 --> 03:16:27,430
Yummy ramen!

3576
03:16:31,990 --> 03:16:36,710
I'll bet if I kissed you, you'd taste like a wild beast.

3577
03:16:42,670 --> 03:16:46,590
Do you know where exactly in Grozengrad Sokolov is located?

3578
03:16:46,770 --> 03:16:51,330
I bet if I kissed you, you'd taste like a wild beast.

3579
03:16:51,730 --> 03:16:53,770
Yeah, I've been eating snakes, Eva.

3580
03:16:53,870 --> 03:16:54,170
Please.

3581
03:16:54,650 --> 03:16:57,130
There's the east wing, which houses the research facilities.

3582
03:16:58,590 --> 03:17:01,110
Then there's the main wing, where the weapons are assembled.

3583
03:17:01,450 --> 03:17:02,970
That's where the Shagohan is.

3584
03:17:02,990 --> 03:17:08,310
Finally, there's the west wing, which is connected via a passageway to the main building.

3585
03:17:09,070 --> 03:17:10,450
That's where Sokolov is.

3586
03:17:11,170 --> 03:17:12,370
Oh boy, Grozengrad.

3587
03:17:12,690 --> 03:17:14,470
To get in, you'll have to enter the main wing from the east wing.

3588
03:17:14,630 --> 03:17:18,530
Then go through the passageway on the second floor of the main wing.

3589
03:17:18,670 --> 03:17:19,530
Then go through the passageway on the second floor of the main wing.

3590
03:17:19,530 --> 03:17:20,930
The west wing of the weapons lab.

3591
03:17:21,230 --> 03:17:21,870
Got it.

3592
03:17:24,210 --> 03:17:25,470
There's just one problem.

3593
03:17:25,730 --> 03:17:25,990
What?

3594
03:17:26,230 --> 03:17:26,970
Not again.

3595
03:17:27,570 --> 03:17:30,430
The west wing is protected by the highest level of security.

3596
03:17:30,750 --> 03:17:32,530
You need to be Colonel Class to get in.

3597
03:17:33,090 --> 03:17:34,030
Colonel Class?

3598
03:17:34,990 --> 03:17:35,550
Here.

3599
03:17:38,390 --> 03:17:40,550
Major Ivan Raidenovich Rykov.

3600
03:17:40,770 --> 03:17:40,890
Major Ivan Raidenovich Rykov.

3601
03:17:41,890 --> 03:17:43,010
Raidenovich Rykov?

3602
03:17:43,010 --> 03:17:44,290
How do I do that?

3603
03:17:45,930 --> 03:17:46,710
Oh my god.

3604
03:17:46,730 --> 03:17:47,530
Rykov time.

3605
03:17:47,670 --> 03:17:48,190
I love this.

3606
03:17:48,270 --> 03:17:49,370
This is the best time ever!

3607
03:17:52,810 --> 03:17:54,110
The steel is closed.

3608
03:17:54,330 --> 03:17:57,010
You look similar from behind.

3609
03:17:57,050 --> 03:17:58,010
You won't know the difference.

3610
03:17:58,490 --> 03:18:00,030
Your face might be a problem.

3611
03:18:00,150 --> 03:18:01,710
So you just have to figure something out.

3612
03:18:02,130 --> 03:18:04,150
He should be somewhere in the east wing.

3613
03:18:04,430 --> 03:18:05,430
Oh my god.

3614
03:18:05,530 --> 03:18:05,910
You!

3615
03:18:06,910 --> 03:18:07,350
You!

3616
03:18:11,710 --> 03:18:12,890
Oh my god.

3617
03:18:12,890 --> 03:18:14,190
Rykov, my beloved.

3618
03:18:19,150 --> 03:18:20,390
Yeah, we're both caked up.

3619
03:18:20,450 --> 03:18:21,430
They won't even tell the difference.

3620
03:18:21,490 --> 03:18:23,570
As long as nobody grabs my crotch.

3621
03:18:25,290 --> 03:18:27,890
Command said you're supposed to have something ready for me.

3622
03:18:28,570 --> 03:18:29,330
And I do.

3623
03:18:29,730 --> 03:18:30,390
A kiss.

3624
03:18:30,710 --> 03:18:32,410
There's a lake 30 miles north of here.

3625
03:18:32,410 --> 03:18:32,770
A lake.

3626
03:18:34,210 --> 03:18:35,290
I hid a wig there.

3627
03:18:35,350 --> 03:18:35,750
A wig?

3628
03:18:36,110 --> 03:18:36,850
A wig.

3629
03:18:37,430 --> 03:18:39,570
It's a state of the art ground effect vehicle.

3630
03:18:40,150 --> 03:18:40,590
Oh.

3631
03:18:40,770 --> 03:18:42,130
A ground effect vehicle.

3632
03:18:42,950 --> 03:18:43,470
She doesn't like my hairstyle.

3633
03:18:43,470 --> 03:18:44,390
I can't fly one of those.

3634
03:18:45,570 --> 03:18:46,110
That's okay.

3635
03:18:47,070 --> 03:18:48,750
I happen to be an excellent pilot.

3636
03:18:50,050 --> 03:18:52,470
Taking off from a lake is trickier than it looks.

3637
03:18:52,710 --> 03:18:54,270
It's not like riding a motorcycle.

3638
03:18:54,470 --> 03:18:55,950
You've got to be more delicate.

3639
03:18:56,290 --> 03:18:57,150
Of course I will.

3640
03:18:57,210 --> 03:18:58,890
You've seen how good I am with the bike, right?

3641
03:19:01,670 --> 03:19:02,070
Right.

3642
03:19:06,270 --> 03:19:07,730
You handle the escape then.

3643
03:19:08,050 --> 03:19:09,330
I'll head for Groznykrad.

3644
03:19:10,570 --> 03:19:10,970
How?

3645
03:19:11,170 --> 03:19:11,830
Wait a minute.

3646
03:19:12,890 --> 03:19:14,490
There's something I wanted to ask you.

3647
03:19:14,570 --> 03:19:14,890
What?

3648
03:19:15,250 --> 03:19:15,770
What?

3649
03:19:17,750 --> 03:19:19,790
What's the story between you and the boss?

3650
03:19:21,230 --> 03:19:22,810
She was like a mother.

3651
03:19:22,990 --> 03:19:24,110
And my master.

3652
03:19:25,410 --> 03:19:26,390
And your lover?

3653
03:19:27,290 --> 03:19:28,970
It went deeper than that.

3654
03:19:29,670 --> 03:19:30,190
Deeper?

3655
03:19:32,570 --> 03:19:34,510
Half of me belongs to the boss.

3656
03:19:35,850 --> 03:19:36,910
Do you love her?

3657
03:19:38,530 --> 03:19:39,730
No, nothing like that.

3658
03:19:39,730 --> 03:19:40,690
Do you hate her?

3659
03:19:42,070 --> 03:19:43,810
Does it have to be one or the other?

3660
03:19:44,490 --> 03:19:45,350
Love or hate?

3661
03:19:46,670 --> 03:19:48,350
Between a man and a woman?

3662
03:19:50,410 --> 03:19:51,330
You bet.

3663
03:19:51,910 --> 03:19:53,510
Oh my god, he turns away.

3664
03:19:53,610 --> 03:19:55,730
For ten years, we lived and died together.

3665
03:19:55,830 --> 03:19:56,990
You couldn't possibly understand.

3666
03:19:58,750 --> 03:20:01,010
And you think you can kill her now?

3667
03:20:01,410 --> 03:20:02,930
And you think you can kill her now?

3668
03:20:02,930 --> 03:20:03,930
Eva's so hot.

3669
03:20:04,410 --> 03:20:05,730
That's your mission, isn't it?

3670
03:20:07,250 --> 03:20:08,190
Assassinating the boss?

3671
03:20:09,650 --> 03:20:10,150
Mmm...

3672
03:20:21,230 --> 03:20:22,350
Oh, Snake...

3673
03:20:22,350 --> 03:20:22,590
Snake?

3674
03:20:23,410 --> 03:20:24,830
Is there anyone you like?

3675
03:20:24,870 --> 03:20:25,350
Oh my god!

3676
03:20:28,450 --> 03:20:31,490
I've never been interested in other people's lives.

3677
03:20:32,070 --> 03:20:33,170
Anybody you like?

3678
03:20:33,190 --> 03:20:34,370
You were interested in the boss?

3679
03:20:34,550 --> 03:20:35,010
Sir Catboy?

3680
03:20:36,570 --> 03:20:37,670
She was different.

3681
03:20:39,390 --> 03:20:39,890
Really?

3682
03:20:40,970 --> 03:20:42,330
How do you feel about me?

3683
03:20:43,710 --> 03:20:46,050
I should be asking you the same question.

3684
03:20:46,510 --> 03:20:47,010
Me?

3685
03:20:48,390 --> 03:20:49,330
I can fall in love.

3686
03:20:49,450 --> 03:20:50,630
If it's part of the mission.

3687
03:20:53,750 --> 03:20:54,890
Even with you.

3688
03:20:57,430 --> 03:20:58,250
Oh my god.

3689
03:20:59,770 --> 03:21:02,090
He just has no shame.

3690
03:21:03,410 --> 03:21:04,650
He has no shame.

3691
03:21:04,730 --> 03:21:05,250
He just looks.

3692
03:21:05,430 --> 03:21:07,930
Snake, your mind is elsewhere.

3693
03:21:08,210 --> 03:21:09,550
Snake, please, I'm kissing you.

3694
03:21:10,050 --> 03:21:12,570
Oh my god, he just does not even reciprocate.

3695
03:21:12,570 --> 03:21:13,490
Even a little bit.

3696
03:21:13,550 --> 03:21:14,110
He's like a tuna.

3697
03:21:14,370 --> 03:21:16,590
He's just a dead fish right there.

3698
03:21:23,300 --> 03:21:23,700
Snake!

3699
03:21:24,060 --> 03:21:24,260
Snake!

3700
03:21:24,260 --> 03:21:25,380
He's like, this isn't part of the mission.

3701
03:21:27,120 --> 03:21:27,900
That wasn't me!

3702
03:21:28,020 --> 03:21:28,460
It wasn't me!

3703
03:21:28,540 --> 03:21:28,820
It wasn't me!

3704
03:21:36,440 --> 03:21:37,240
A tuna?

3705
03:21:37,560 --> 03:21:41,220
I say that because that's what they call fans.

3706
03:21:41,600 --> 03:21:42,740
Or rather, they used to.

3707
03:21:42,780 --> 03:21:43,680
I don't know if they still do.

3708
03:21:43,840 --> 03:21:47,720
But they used to call fans at idol shows that would just kind of stand there and do nothing.

3709
03:21:47,880 --> 03:21:50,240
And just watch the show with their arms crossed.

3710
03:21:50,600 --> 03:21:50,720
And just watch the show with their arms crossed.

3711
03:21:50,720 --> 03:21:51,660
Or not cheering.

3712
03:21:51,880 --> 03:21:53,720
Not having pen lights or anything like that.

3713
03:21:54,480 --> 03:21:55,680
They called them maguro.

3714
03:21:56,400 --> 03:21:58,380
And so I just...

3715
03:22:00,640 --> 03:22:01,860
Just adopted it.

3716
03:22:11,620 --> 03:22:13,000
Standing man emoji.

3717
03:22:13,180 --> 03:22:13,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3718
03:22:29,780 --> 03:22:31,500
I'm definitely a maguro then.

3719
03:22:32,620 --> 03:22:36,500
However you want to enjoy the concert is up to you.

3720
03:22:38,640 --> 03:22:39,820
There she goes.

3721
03:22:42,900 --> 03:22:43,980
Oh my gosh.

3722
03:22:44,200 --> 03:22:45,360
I hope you see us a lot.

3723
03:22:50,880 --> 03:22:51,740
Oh no.

3724
03:22:53,340 --> 03:22:56,480
I'm feeling it in my ectoplasm.

3725
03:23:03,350 --> 03:23:04,610
Get out of there!

3726
03:23:07,830 --> 03:23:09,030
Or don't.

3727
03:23:09,030 --> 03:23:09,210
Or don't.

3728
03:23:09,850 --> 03:23:10,450
Hehehehe.

3729
03:23:19,280 --> 03:23:19,880
Hoorah!

3730
03:23:20,420 --> 03:23:21,020
Hoorah!

3731
03:23:22,680 --> 03:23:23,280
Oh!

3732
03:23:27,410 --> 03:23:28,330
His shoes!

3733
03:23:29,170 --> 03:23:29,690
Colonel.

3734
03:23:31,670 --> 03:23:32,830
Hey, talk.

3735
03:23:34,350 --> 03:23:36,090
Why were you walking like that?

3736
03:23:36,150 --> 03:23:37,530
I died before I could get it out of him.

3737
03:23:37,870 --> 03:23:40,270
His arms are like so wide apart.

3738
03:23:40,710 --> 03:23:41,010
Hehehe.

3739
03:23:41,750 --> 03:23:42,110
Hehehe.

3740
03:23:44,230 --> 03:23:46,090
Was it the spy then?

3741
03:23:46,950 --> 03:23:47,190
Mmm.

3742
03:23:48,270 --> 03:23:49,930
Oh yeah, nice shoes.

3743
03:23:50,610 --> 03:23:51,210
Oh!

3744
03:23:52,970 --> 03:23:53,610
Oh!

3745
03:23:54,470 --> 03:23:55,110
Or...

3746
03:23:55,110 --> 03:23:55,870
Look at this.

3747
03:23:57,870 --> 03:23:58,190
Transmitter?

3748
03:23:58,530 --> 03:23:59,170
Exactly.

3749
03:23:59,630 --> 03:24:02,530
I had to keep someone informed of his location.

3750
03:24:02,850 --> 03:24:03,310
Dun dun.

3751
03:24:08,350 --> 03:24:08,990
But...

3752
03:24:08,990 --> 03:24:11,630
Does this mean Granon was the spy?

3753
03:24:11,630 --> 03:24:13,430
Oh my gosh, I can't wait to see this guy.

3754
03:24:13,450 --> 03:24:15,530
Perhaps he was being used by someone else.

3755
03:24:15,650 --> 03:24:15,990
Perhaps.

3756
03:24:16,130 --> 03:24:18,070
The way he moves, everything.

3757
03:24:18,170 --> 03:24:19,910
Oh my god!

3758
03:24:20,290 --> 03:24:21,970
I love Ocelot so much.

3759
03:24:23,950 --> 03:24:25,930
I don't approve of your methods.

3760
03:24:26,970 --> 03:24:29,150
I don't need your approval.

3761
03:24:29,870 --> 03:24:31,290
I'm in command here.

3762
03:24:31,690 --> 03:24:31,870
Yeah.

3763
03:24:32,710 --> 03:24:34,490
Oh my god, the tension.

3764
03:24:34,910 --> 03:24:36,010
And that nuclear shell.

3765
03:24:36,250 --> 03:24:37,470
He's always pointing.

3766
03:24:38,130 --> 03:24:39,390
He's always pointing.

3767
03:24:43,810 --> 03:24:45,210
He's such a theater kid.

3768
03:24:45,330 --> 03:24:45,570
I know!

3769
03:24:46,150 --> 03:24:46,370
This is war, Major.

3770
03:24:46,370 --> 03:24:47,090
The Cold War.

3771
03:24:47,330 --> 03:24:49,910
Fought with information and espionage.

3772
03:24:50,870 --> 03:24:53,710
We must root out spies wherever they hide.

3773
03:24:54,910 --> 03:24:55,510
It is kill or be killed.

3774
03:24:55,510 --> 03:24:57,510
All the guys have blue eyes.

3775
03:24:57,570 --> 03:24:58,210
Have you noticed that?

3776
03:24:58,270 --> 03:24:59,890
Potential threats must be weeded out.

3777
03:25:00,310 --> 03:25:02,110
They're all staring into my soul.

3778
03:25:02,110 --> 03:25:04,170
Your feelings are a menace to the unity of our organization.

3779
03:25:05,350 --> 03:25:07,330
Someone is guiding the enemy's hand.

3780
03:25:08,190 --> 03:25:11,370
A single man can only accomplish so much.

3781
03:25:11,370 --> 03:25:11,610
Ooh.

3782
03:25:11,630 --> 03:25:12,830
Make no mistake.

3783
03:25:12,990 --> 03:25:14,370
There is a spy among us.

3784
03:25:14,470 --> 03:25:15,910
But casting suspicion on our old comrades.

3785
03:25:16,090 --> 03:25:17,930
The C3 explosives have been stolen.

3786
03:25:18,370 --> 03:25:19,850
You think it was the American?

3787
03:25:20,330 --> 03:25:20,890
No.

3788
03:25:21,470 --> 03:25:24,110
He could not have reached this fortress yet.

3789
03:25:27,030 --> 03:25:27,590
Who?

3790
03:25:28,170 --> 03:25:29,910
I'd be careful about suspicions.

3791
03:25:30,150 --> 03:25:32,350
Well, I guess Vulcan doesn't have blue eyes.

3792
03:25:32,450 --> 03:25:33,730
But they're, like, brighter, you know?

3793
03:25:34,010 --> 03:25:34,570
Boss.

3794
03:25:34,730 --> 03:25:35,150
Boss.

3795
03:25:38,030 --> 03:25:39,330
Where have you been?

3796
03:25:39,670 --> 03:25:40,770
You smell.

3797
03:25:41,630 --> 03:25:43,630
Fear and the End have fallen.

3798
03:25:43,810 --> 03:25:44,130
No!

3799
03:25:46,170 --> 03:25:49,190
Ooh, you couldn't get the End's weapon because I have it.

3800
03:25:53,290 --> 03:25:54,130
Damn it!

3801
03:25:54,930 --> 03:25:55,710
Don't worry.

3802
03:25:55,910 --> 03:25:59,930
He won't be able to get past the Fury because it's the worst enemy.

3803
03:26:01,190 --> 03:26:03,110
That leaves only the Fury.

3804
03:26:04,150 --> 03:26:07,210
How can the legendary Cobras be beaten so easily?

3805
03:26:07,570 --> 03:26:10,370
He's gotta spin some...

3806
03:26:11,550 --> 03:26:12,650
Oh my god.

3807
03:26:16,470 --> 03:26:17,170
Don't worry.

3808
03:26:17,770 --> 03:26:19,030
I'll take care of him.

3809
03:26:19,130 --> 03:26:19,830
Oh my god.

3810
03:26:20,510 --> 03:26:21,830
What is he after?

3811
03:26:22,670 --> 03:26:24,670
Must be more than just Sokolov.

3812
03:26:25,930 --> 03:26:29,890
America is out to destroy the Shagahod and get its hands on your inheritance.

3813
03:26:30,090 --> 03:26:32,150
It was very silent there.

3814
03:26:32,310 --> 03:26:33,470
The Philosopher's Legacy.

3815
03:26:35,010 --> 03:26:35,570
Impossible.

3816
03:26:35,570 --> 03:26:37,630
The Legacy.

3817
03:26:38,030 --> 03:26:38,530
It...

3818
03:26:40,410 --> 03:26:41,450
Kuwabara, Kuwabara.

3819
03:26:41,630 --> 03:26:43,310
Then they're out to kill me as well.

3820
03:26:44,650 --> 03:26:47,150
Colonel, tighten the security on this place.

3821
03:26:47,550 --> 03:26:48,070
Boss.

3822
03:26:48,490 --> 03:26:49,390
He's coming here.

3823
03:26:49,510 --> 03:26:50,270
I'm sure of it.

3824
03:26:54,130 --> 03:26:55,930
I'm gonna get the Davy Crockett.

3825
03:27:01,420 --> 03:27:02,460
Kuwabara, Kuwabara.

3826
03:27:06,710 --> 03:27:08,050
I like how...

3827
03:27:09,950 --> 03:27:10,550
How...

3828
03:27:10,550 --> 03:27:11,030
How...

3829
03:27:11,030 --> 03:27:12,950
Eva's just kind of standing there.

3830
03:27:13,130 --> 03:27:14,970
She's just like, what do I do now?

3831
03:27:15,390 --> 03:27:15,490
Hmm?

3832
03:27:15,950 --> 03:27:18,010
Oh, he's gonna snuff her.

3833
03:27:24,070 --> 03:27:24,670
Perfume.

3834
03:27:26,430 --> 03:27:27,030
Points.

3835
03:27:28,390 --> 03:27:32,690
She's like, taking a mental note of that for your birthday.

3836
03:27:35,630 --> 03:27:37,230
You are such a freak.

3837
03:27:37,530 --> 03:27:39,390
This guy is such a freak.

3838
03:27:40,770 --> 03:27:42,190
He's such a freak.

3839
03:27:42,990 --> 03:27:44,330
Oh my god.

3840
03:27:44,330 --> 03:27:45,650
He's so freaky.

3841
03:27:48,150 --> 03:27:48,990
Nice boots.

3842
03:27:50,190 --> 03:27:50,790
Oh.

3843
03:27:52,590 --> 03:27:53,910
Oh, it's got the scuff.

3844
03:27:54,030 --> 03:27:55,450
I'm sure you polished them up properly.

3845
03:27:59,460 --> 03:28:00,060
Points.

3846
03:28:03,100 --> 03:28:04,900
We need like a point encounter.

3847
03:28:05,200 --> 03:28:07,080
How many times does he point at people?

3848
03:28:07,560 --> 03:28:09,280
I bet he smells snake on her.

3849
03:28:09,540 --> 03:28:10,340
That's the perfume.

3850
03:28:10,920 --> 03:28:12,040
It's snake's cologne.

3851
03:28:13,300 --> 03:28:14,180
Goat musk.

3852
03:28:20,740 --> 03:28:21,860
Oh my gosh.

3853
03:28:23,560 --> 03:28:24,220
Cheetah print.

3854
03:28:26,440 --> 03:28:27,280
It's not Eva.

3855
03:28:27,380 --> 03:28:28,000
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

3856
03:28:28,160 --> 03:28:28,520
What's her name?

3857
03:28:28,620 --> 03:28:29,060
Tatiana.

3858
03:28:32,020 --> 03:28:32,460
Oh.

3859
03:28:34,220 --> 03:28:35,100
Hello, Krasnigrad.

3860
03:28:35,380 --> 03:28:37,880
Wait, can you see like the little guys walking around at this part?

3861
03:28:47,080 --> 03:28:48,740
This place is empty.

3862
03:28:49,500 --> 03:28:49,620
This place is empty.

3863
03:28:49,620 --> 03:28:50,740
Oh, Kerotan.

3864
03:28:58,470 --> 03:28:59,770
Oh, there's a guy.

3865
03:28:59,970 --> 03:29:00,770
You think I can snipe him?

3866
03:29:04,290 --> 03:29:05,990
You think I can snipe him?

3867
03:29:07,350 --> 03:29:09,510
These tanks look like little M&M's.

3868
03:29:13,160 --> 03:29:13,960
Do it.

3869
03:29:21,400 --> 03:29:23,660
Okay, well definitely with the fury, we're just...

3870
03:29:23,660 --> 03:29:25,460
Actually, I don't want to even prank him.

3871
03:29:25,600 --> 03:29:26,640
I want to just take him out.

3872
03:29:27,140 --> 03:29:28,920
Viewers are commenting on the streamer's fidgeting.

3873
03:29:28,960 --> 03:29:30,300
Silence in a parent person.

3874
03:29:46,100 --> 03:29:47,140
A parent, eh?

3875
03:29:48,020 --> 03:29:48,400
Hmm.

3876
03:29:55,610 --> 03:29:56,330
Okay, YouTube.

3877
03:29:58,970 --> 03:29:59,750
Oh my gosh.

3878
03:30:00,110 --> 03:30:01,270
Wait, how do I zoom in again?

3879
03:30:01,850 --> 03:30:02,390
There we go.

3880
03:30:03,550 --> 03:30:05,530
Oh my god, I really could get his butt.

3881
03:30:05,950 --> 03:30:06,950
I could get his butt.

3882
03:30:11,490 --> 03:30:12,930
Such a waste of bullets.

3883
03:30:16,530 --> 03:30:17,930
Such a waste of bullets.

3884
03:30:18,170 --> 03:30:18,570
Such a waste of bullets.

3885
03:30:18,570 --> 03:30:18,710
It's such a waste of bullets.

3886
03:30:24,200 --> 03:30:24,720
Goodnight!

3887
03:30:28,150 --> 03:30:31,990
You could even see the little zzz's from all the way over here.

3888
03:30:38,240 --> 03:30:39,020
Don't fall.

3889
03:30:39,400 --> 03:30:39,480
Don't fall.

3890
03:30:40,560 --> 03:30:42,020
How did she get...

3891
03:30:42,020 --> 03:30:43,660
from here...

3892
03:30:44,280 --> 03:30:45,680
all the way...

3893
03:30:46,920 --> 03:30:47,440
Huh...

3894
03:30:50,460 --> 03:30:51,260
The zzz's.

3895
03:30:51,420 --> 03:30:54,840
Oh, it's been a while since I've called Colonel and stuff, so let's see.

3896
03:30:55,220 --> 03:30:57,300
I wonder if there's a silencer for the Mosin.

3897
03:30:57,620 --> 03:30:58,580
That would be incredible.

3898
03:31:31,520 --> 03:31:32,040
Tatyana.

3899
03:31:32,300 --> 03:31:32,600
Oh.

3900
03:31:38,220 --> 03:31:38,740
Tatyana.

3901
03:31:39,260 --> 03:31:41,720
Miss Paramedic, don't worry, we'll get to her next.

3902
03:31:43,740 --> 03:31:46,020
What does Paramedic have to say?

3903
03:31:51,180 --> 03:31:51,980
What are these?

3904
03:31:56,160 --> 03:31:56,600
Selenoyars.

3905
03:31:57,660 --> 03:31:58,100
Oh.

3906
03:32:00,160 --> 03:32:03,820
That means she really likes it because it looks like something... a shiitake mushroom.

3907
03:32:06,040 --> 03:32:10,700
Yeah, will it recharge my batteries?

3908
03:32:11,160 --> 03:32:12,280
It's a luminescent.

3909
03:32:12,780 --> 03:32:13,800
Alright, let's save real quick.

3910
03:32:15,540 --> 03:32:16,700
Yes, actually, please.

3911
03:32:18,360 --> 03:32:21,060
So, the third slide...

3912
03:32:21,180 --> 03:32:21,260
What?

3913
03:32:22,720 --> 03:32:23,940
Don't save over that one.

3914
03:32:26,040 --> 03:32:27,400
I don't like mushrooms.

3915
03:32:29,340 --> 03:32:30,940
I don't like any mushrooms.

3916
03:32:31,420 --> 03:32:32,660
I hate mushrooms.

3917
03:32:33,500 --> 03:32:34,780
I hate mushrooms.

3918
03:32:36,980 --> 03:32:39,640
20,000 leagues under the sea?

3919
03:32:39,700 --> 03:32:40,800
I love that ride at Disney.

3920
03:32:41,440 --> 03:32:50,420
After a number of battleships mysteriously sink at sea, the American government investigates and finds that the culprit is this pacifistic Captain Nemo.

3921
03:32:51,220 --> 03:32:52,260
I'm afraid of mushrooms.

3922
03:32:52,260 --> 03:32:55,660
The scene where the giant squid attacks Captain Nemo's submarine, the Nautilus, is breathtaking.

3923
03:32:56,380 --> 03:32:59,140
But also, I don't like when they're really slimy, you know?

3924
03:32:59,220 --> 03:33:00,860
And it was great to see it on the big screen.

3925
03:33:01,500 --> 03:33:03,020
A giant squid, huh?

3926
03:33:03,300 --> 03:33:03,940
Giant squid?

3927
03:33:04,080 --> 03:33:04,200
What?

3928
03:33:04,660 --> 03:33:06,580
Don't tell me you think it sounds tasty.

3929
03:33:11,520 --> 03:33:12,860
Which way do I go again?

3930
03:33:13,040 --> 03:33:14,280
Do I just... do I go down?

3931
03:33:14,440 --> 03:33:14,880
I can't remember.

3932
03:33:19,160 --> 03:33:20,540
Do I just go down?

3933
03:33:22,860 --> 03:33:24,380
Funny codec if you eat the mushroom.

3934
03:33:24,540 --> 03:33:24,960
Oh, okay.

3935
03:33:27,260 --> 03:33:28,600
Wait, I gotta eat the mushroom.

3936
03:33:29,520 --> 03:33:30,500
Back through the door.

3937
03:33:30,800 --> 03:33:32,420
You can't make me, you can't make me.

3938
03:33:33,800 --> 03:33:35,200
You can't make me!

3939
03:33:35,800 --> 03:33:36,520
Oh, here it is.

3940
03:33:38,400 --> 03:33:40,380
A uroluminescent mush... mushroom.

3941
03:33:40,920 --> 03:33:41,340
Eat.

3942
03:33:45,320 --> 03:33:46,580
Paramedic, it's poisonous.

3943
03:33:46,980 --> 03:33:48,360
Oh, paramedic!

3944
03:33:50,920 --> 03:33:54,960
I contracted food poisoning from eating naturally poisonous food.

3945
03:33:55,880 --> 03:33:57,280
Use an antidote.

3946
03:34:00,720 --> 03:34:01,360
Paramedic!

3947
03:34:01,940 --> 03:34:03,720
You lying...

3948
03:34:03,720 --> 03:34:05,860
I thought you were supposed to be a doctor.

3949
03:34:06,940 --> 03:34:09,040
By the way, paramedic.

3950
03:34:09,080 --> 03:34:09,380
Yeah?

3951
03:34:09,540 --> 03:34:09,880
What?

3952
03:34:10,080 --> 03:34:13,560
I tried that uroluminescent mushroom you were talking about.

3953
03:34:13,560 --> 03:34:15,140
So how did it taste?

3954
03:34:15,220 --> 03:34:16,040
Like urinal.

3955
03:34:16,100 --> 03:34:16,260
It was poisonous.

3956
03:34:16,500 --> 03:34:18,460
More like urinal luminescent.

3957
03:34:18,600 --> 03:34:18,700
What?

3958
03:34:18,700 --> 03:34:19,720
It was a poison mushroom.

3959
03:34:20,680 --> 03:34:21,160
Really?

3960
03:34:21,180 --> 03:34:22,260
It was a poison mushroom.

3961
03:34:22,260 --> 03:34:22,440
Yeah.

3962
03:34:23,000 --> 03:34:23,860
That's weird.

3963
03:34:24,180 --> 03:34:25,620
The guide says it's...

3964
03:34:25,620 --> 03:34:27,220
Are you sure that guide is reliable?

3965
03:34:27,840 --> 03:34:28,480
Don't worry.

3966
03:34:28,640 --> 03:34:29,220
It's fine.

3967
03:34:29,420 --> 03:34:31,380
It just happened to be wrong this one time.

3968
03:34:37,500 --> 03:34:38,820
It was poisonous.

3969
03:34:38,820 --> 03:34:39,000
It was poisonous.

3970
03:34:41,580 --> 03:34:42,620
It was poisonous.

3971
03:34:44,640 --> 03:34:45,500
Let's go.

3972
03:34:51,630 --> 03:34:54,090
Oh, I forgot to get my ramen noodles.

3973
03:34:56,710 --> 03:34:57,470
Alrighty.

3974
03:35:03,290 --> 03:35:05,010
Come on, please!

3975
03:35:06,250 --> 03:35:07,430
Give me more bullets.

3976
03:35:08,690 --> 03:35:10,030
Wait, what's under there?

3977
03:35:10,230 --> 03:35:10,990
Bullets?

3978
03:35:12,530 --> 03:35:13,410
Bullets, for sure.

3979
03:35:16,970 --> 03:35:17,470
Oh!

3980
03:35:22,820 --> 03:35:24,480
Andragos, thank you for the 20 gift!

3981
03:35:24,520 --> 03:35:24,940
Thank you!

3982
03:35:29,350 --> 03:35:29,990
Oh, wait.

3983
03:35:30,030 --> 03:35:32,330
This is gonna show me just in here.

3984
03:35:32,430 --> 03:35:32,570
Yeah.

3985
03:35:32,670 --> 03:35:32,970
Okay.

3986
03:35:35,370 --> 03:35:35,870
No.

3987
03:35:36,110 --> 03:35:36,990
Mark 22.

3988
03:35:37,590 --> 03:35:38,430
So sad.

3989
03:35:39,630 --> 03:35:40,610
Guess I'll die.

3990
03:35:42,030 --> 03:35:44,310
I don't remember Mark 22 ammo being this rare.

3991
03:35:44,570 --> 03:35:44,810
Right!

3992
03:35:46,710 --> 03:35:48,970
Why would they think I'm using so many other things?

3993
03:35:49,190 --> 03:35:49,670
I don't know.

3994
03:35:50,550 --> 03:35:51,430
It's craziness.

3995
03:35:51,770 --> 03:35:52,150
All right.

3996
03:35:52,190 --> 03:35:52,850
Where do I need to go?

3997
03:35:56,130 --> 03:35:56,790
To the...

3998
03:35:56,790 --> 03:35:57,770
X marks the spot.

3999
03:36:04,560 --> 03:36:05,820
X marks the spot.

4000
03:36:06,020 --> 03:36:06,220
Okay.

4001
03:36:07,040 --> 03:36:07,780
Here we go.

4002
03:36:10,620 --> 03:36:12,240
Here we'll sneaky crawl.

4003
03:36:12,980 --> 03:36:13,740
Oh, okay.

4004
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:15,540
Camera angle kind of messed me up there.

4005
03:36:19,200 --> 03:36:20,080
Oh, gosh!

4006
03:36:20,260 --> 03:36:20,800
Oh, gosh!

4007
03:36:24,220 --> 03:36:25,640
There's another guy up there.

4008
03:36:25,640 --> 03:36:25,700
There's a guy up there.

4009
03:36:28,680 --> 03:36:29,240
No.

4010
03:36:31,700 --> 03:36:32,260
There's a guy up there.

4011
03:36:32,260 --> 03:36:34,140
Oh, there you are.

4012
03:36:34,140 --> 03:36:35,340
Shake down the guard.

4013
03:36:35,460 --> 03:36:35,820
Yeah.

4014
03:36:39,240 --> 03:36:40,400
But that would...

4015
03:36:40,400 --> 03:36:43,580
I could shake them down, yes.

4016
03:36:43,700 --> 03:36:44,520
That is a thing.

4017
03:36:50,450 --> 03:36:51,690
Shaking them down.

4018
03:36:51,830 --> 03:36:53,850
That would require me holding them up, though.

4019
03:36:55,430 --> 03:36:56,010
And we're going to kill that back.

4020
03:36:56,010 --> 03:36:59,870
And once I put away my gun, they can shoot me, right?

4021
03:37:00,630 --> 03:37:02,690
Crazy last night, I'm processing the pics now.

4022
03:37:02,850 --> 03:37:04,630
So much Ota was hella hype.

4023
03:37:04,770 --> 03:37:06,630
Should I post under Fantography or use a...

4024
03:37:06,630 --> 03:37:07,090
Oh!

4025
03:37:07,970 --> 03:37:08,690
What is...

4026
03:37:09,210 --> 03:37:10,730
Oh my god, oh no!

4027
03:37:11,450 --> 03:37:13,910
Oh, I forgot about the Flamethrower, guys!

4028
03:37:20,030 --> 03:37:21,770
Oh, we are so in trouble.

4029
03:37:37,370 --> 03:37:38,450
Get out of here.

4030
03:37:48,020 --> 03:37:48,780
Oh my god.

4031
03:37:49,240 --> 03:37:50,500
Controlling it with this camera angle.

4032
03:37:50,640 --> 03:37:51,680
Oh god, I gotta be fast though.

4033
03:37:57,330 --> 03:38:00,090
I don't wanna get in his walking path, you know?

4034
03:38:04,140 --> 03:38:05,600
Maybe I could take him down from behind.

4035
03:38:16,590 --> 03:38:16,930
Sorry.

4036
03:38:18,550 --> 03:38:18,890
Sorry.

4037
03:38:19,730 --> 03:38:20,070
Sorry.

4038
03:38:21,430 --> 03:38:21,770
Sorry.

4039
03:38:22,310 --> 03:38:23,310
You will be in the river.

4040
03:38:24,930 --> 03:38:25,890
Sorry, you'll be in the river.

4041
03:38:26,690 --> 03:38:27,030
Sorry.

4042
03:38:33,170 --> 03:38:33,530
You'll be in the river.

4043
03:38:33,530 --> 03:38:34,290
I'll remember you.

4044
03:38:35,370 --> 03:38:37,190
I'll remember you when I see you in the river.

4045
03:38:39,150 --> 03:38:39,650
Loot him?

4046
03:38:39,830 --> 03:38:40,630
Oh yeah, you're right.

4047
03:38:44,540 --> 03:38:45,980
Is this guy coming down too?

4048
03:38:47,240 --> 03:38:48,060
Oh yeah, he is.

4049
03:38:48,260 --> 03:38:49,100
Oh shoot, you guys.

4050
03:38:49,260 --> 03:38:49,940
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4051
03:38:50,160 --> 03:38:50,680
Hold on.

4052
03:38:52,700 --> 03:38:55,020
I'll go... Oh wait, he's gonna see him, isn't he?

4053
03:38:55,840 --> 03:38:57,000
Wait, I think I'm in trouble.

4054
03:38:58,260 --> 03:38:59,660
Is he gonna see him dead on the ground?

4055
03:39:00,380 --> 03:39:01,060
Um...

4056
03:39:07,810 --> 03:39:08,490
Guys?

4057
03:39:08,490 --> 03:39:09,170
Nothing?

4058
03:39:26,920 --> 03:39:27,600
Uh...

4059
03:39:27,600 --> 03:39:28,740
Who's that?

4060
03:39:29,280 --> 03:39:29,960
95

4061
03:39:34,110 --> 03:39:36,750
cam on my ass!

4062
03:39:40,510 --> 03:39:42,150
Um... I'm on fire.

4063
03:39:52,210 --> 03:39:55,710
Oh my god,

4064
03:40:07,370 --> 03:40:08,890
I'm getting... I don't know about you!

4065
03:40:09,530 --> 03:40:11,030
I'm getting deja vu!

4066
03:40:11,490 --> 03:40:11,910
What?

4067
03:40:13,030 --> 03:40:13,810
Someone's on fire.

4068
03:40:16,250 --> 03:40:18,230
I'm feeling real deja vu right now.

4069
03:40:33,350 --> 03:40:34,890
I'm like right next to it.

4070
03:40:35,010 --> 03:40:36,270
But I have to pass it!

4071
03:40:37,930 --> 03:40:38,370
Okay.

4072
03:40:40,270 --> 03:40:42,030
Okay, let's go back.

4073
03:40:43,490 --> 03:40:44,750
Let's just wait it out here.

4074
03:40:44,910 --> 03:40:45,970
Oh, let me treat my burns.

4075
03:40:47,850 --> 03:40:50,030
I'm not ready for...

4076
03:40:50,770 --> 03:40:52,190
I'm not ready for...

4077
03:40:55,820 --> 03:40:56,860
I'm not ready.

4078
03:40:57,080 --> 03:40:58,280
I need more ointment.

4079
03:40:59,240 --> 03:41:00,080
Friendly fire.

4080
03:41:00,280 --> 03:41:00,860
I know, right?

4081
03:41:03,500 --> 03:41:04,220
This guy.

4082
03:41:14,630 --> 03:41:18,370
Are they gonna see that guy's dead body and then get mad again?

4083
03:41:18,370 --> 03:41:20,950
You've lost the enemy.

4084
03:41:21,090 --> 03:41:21,950
Enter high alert.

4085
03:41:24,190 --> 03:41:25,070
Don't look in yet.

4086
03:41:25,990 --> 03:41:26,730
No, I'm not.

4087
03:41:27,010 --> 03:41:28,230
I've literally...

4088
03:41:29,830 --> 03:41:31,050
I'm so far.

4089
03:41:31,190 --> 03:41:31,870
I'm so gone.

4090
03:41:36,380 --> 03:41:37,580
Why is it called that?

4091
03:41:37,640 --> 03:41:38,740
It's not friendly at all.

4092
03:41:38,900 --> 03:41:40,960
It's... you're... you're... you're...

4093
03:41:41,560 --> 03:41:43,840
Um... you... I never got to loot that guy.

4094
03:41:44,260 --> 03:41:45,740
It's towards your friends.

4095
03:41:45,780 --> 03:41:46,400
That's why.

4096
03:41:47,780 --> 03:41:49,300
You're not gonna peek in here, are you?

4097
03:41:51,420 --> 03:41:52,220
Oh my god.

4098
03:41:52,340 --> 03:41:53,000
What was that?

4099
03:41:53,320 --> 03:41:54,100
Oh my god!

4100
03:41:54,240 --> 03:41:55,420
That's a dead guy right there!

4101
03:41:55,660 --> 03:41:56,060
Ah!

4102
03:41:56,240 --> 03:41:57,720
The birds are eating him!

4103
03:41:58,240 --> 03:41:58,720
What's

4104
03:42:02,870 --> 03:42:02,930
wrong?

4105
03:42:03,070 --> 03:42:03,990
Oh my god!

4106
03:42:04,030 --> 03:42:04,690
You were not gonna...

4107
03:42:04,690 --> 03:42:05,990
That... that was not me!

4108
03:42:06,210 --> 03:42:07,450
That was literally you!

4109
03:42:07,650 --> 03:42:09,070
You can't say what's wrong!

4110
03:42:09,310 --> 03:42:10,370
You killed him!

4111
03:42:10,450 --> 03:42:11,450
I didn't kill him!

4112
03:42:16,200 --> 03:42:16,680
No.

4113
03:42:17,160 --> 03:42:18,060
No, no, no.

4114
03:42:19,020 --> 03:42:20,660
No, no, no, no, no.

4115
03:42:20,780 --> 03:42:21,280
What's wrong?

4116
03:42:21,440 --> 03:42:22,240
Oh my god.

4117
03:42:24,260 --> 03:42:25,300
Eat the bird.

4118
03:42:25,920 --> 03:42:26,940
Oh my god.

4119
03:42:27,920 --> 03:42:29,400
What do you mean what's wrong?

4120
03:42:31,640 --> 03:42:32,240
What's wrong?

4121
03:42:32,240 --> 03:42:33,180
I didn't kill him!

4122
03:42:39,650 --> 03:42:42,210
Why do we keep getting into these what's wrong loops?

4123
03:42:48,050 --> 03:42:49,050
We're innocent!

4124
03:42:49,710 --> 03:42:51,130
It wasn't me!

4125
03:42:51,590 --> 03:42:52,830
We're innocent!

4126
03:42:55,570 --> 03:42:56,110
What's wrong?

4127
03:42:58,950 --> 03:43:01,650
Well, we're like right next to where we need to go, right?

4128
03:43:04,830 --> 03:43:05,050
What?

4129
03:43:08,150 --> 03:43:08,990
Let me see.

4130
03:43:09,070 --> 03:43:09,370
Hold on.

4131
03:43:09,950 --> 03:43:14,590
If I come out of the trenches, we're like so close.

4132
03:43:16,830 --> 03:43:17,930
What's wrong loop?

4133
03:43:18,030 --> 03:43:19,610
We're in another what's wrong loop?

4134
03:43:19,790 --> 03:43:21,250
Why does this keep happening to me?

4135
03:43:26,590 --> 03:43:28,590
Your honor, he died of friendly fire.

4136
03:43:28,790 --> 03:43:29,270
I swear!

4137
03:43:29,590 --> 03:43:31,130
I didn't commit the war crimes!

4138
03:43:31,230 --> 03:43:32,230
I only killed one guy!

4139
03:43:40,870 --> 03:43:41,130
Oh my god.

4140
03:43:41,130 --> 03:43:41,490
I hate this part.

4141
03:43:41,570 --> 03:43:43,750
The caution status in this room always resets for no reason.

4142
03:43:43,870 --> 03:43:45,090
It's so wild.

4143
03:43:45,250 --> 03:43:46,030
It's so stupid.

4144
03:43:50,480 --> 03:43:52,140
I'm going to have a mint.

4145
03:43:53,380 --> 03:43:55,160
Or rather like a cough drop.

4146
03:43:56,360 --> 03:43:57,700
Oh, the birds are eating him.

4147
03:43:58,160 --> 03:43:59,360
They're eating him.

4148
03:44:00,180 --> 03:44:01,680
And then I'm going to eat them.

4149
03:44:02,920 --> 03:44:04,400
Oh my god.

4150
03:44:04,860 --> 03:44:06,460
If I shot this bird...

4151
03:44:21,850 --> 03:44:22,590
R-word.

4152
03:44:27,780 --> 03:44:29,000
I have to wait, though.

4153
03:44:32,080 --> 03:44:35,320
Yeah, it's a dog eats dog world out there.

4154
03:44:40,300 --> 03:44:42,540
I mean, the guy is already cooked.

4155
03:44:44,100 --> 03:44:48,560
What a perfect opportunity to eat my first ever man, right?

4156
03:44:49,360 --> 03:44:50,680
He's already been...

4157
03:44:50,680 --> 03:44:50,880
Shut up.

4158
03:45:06,800 --> 03:45:07,760
Too slow.

4159
03:45:07,880 --> 03:45:08,740
I'm waiting it out.

4160
03:45:11,240 --> 03:45:12,820
I don't want to get burned alive.

4161
03:45:13,940 --> 03:45:15,120
Let's wait for another bird.

4162
03:45:16,180 --> 03:45:17,220
Surely one will come.

4163
03:45:18,780 --> 03:45:20,440
And we'll get that bird instead.

4164
03:45:21,360 --> 03:45:21,840
Another.

4165
03:45:22,080 --> 03:45:22,580
Come on, birds!

4166
03:45:23,480 --> 03:45:23,960
Birds!

4167
03:45:24,060 --> 03:45:25,620
Fresh meat right here!

4168
03:45:25,820 --> 03:45:27,260
For you, pre-cooked.

4169
03:45:28,600 --> 03:45:29,500
It's a barbecue.

4170
03:45:32,160 --> 03:45:33,160
Oh my god, see?

4171
03:45:35,680 --> 03:45:37,300
They're about... they're gonna leave soon, though.

4172
03:45:38,020 --> 03:45:39,100
Don't say what's wrong.

4173
03:45:39,240 --> 03:45:39,940
You killed that guy.

4174
03:45:40,740 --> 03:45:41,920
I didn't kill that guy.

4175
03:45:43,240 --> 03:45:44,200
And over.

4176
03:45:59,090 --> 03:46:01,610
Unable to determine the problem is kind of wild.

4177
03:46:03,930 --> 03:46:06,790
I think you know the problem very well, actually.

4178
03:46:18,480 --> 03:46:19,500
Oh, they're still leaving.

4179
03:46:20,440 --> 03:46:21,260
Oh, that was close.

4180
03:46:24,140 --> 03:46:24,540
Okay.

4181
03:46:24,820 --> 03:46:26,200
I don't want to waste the battery.

4182
03:46:31,240 --> 03:46:32,560
Boom, boom, boom.

4183
03:46:33,100 --> 03:46:34,140
Yeah, it's just a mystery.

4184
03:46:34,280 --> 03:46:35,480
Whatever could have happened to that guy.

4185
03:46:39,560 --> 03:46:41,440
Okay, so there is someone right here.

4186
03:46:44,040 --> 03:46:45,100
And I need to exit.

4187
03:46:48,330 --> 03:46:49,290
Okay, he turned around.

4188
03:46:49,390 --> 03:46:49,610
Okay, I'm done.

4189
03:46:50,350 --> 03:46:50,890
Let's see.

4190
03:46:50,970 --> 03:46:58,350
If I leave this spot, and I go up there, and then go to the door.

4191
03:47:07,610 --> 03:47:11,490
I don't think I really feel like waiting, honestly, for a bird.

4192
03:47:16,340 --> 03:47:17,660
Because he's walking away.

4193
03:47:18,120 --> 03:47:19,120
Might be my chance.

4194
03:47:23,000 --> 03:47:23,560
Uh-oh.

4195
03:47:23,680 --> 03:47:24,120
Wait.

4196
03:47:41,450 --> 03:47:42,710
Human meat tastes like pork.

4197
03:47:42,990 --> 03:47:44,230
We call it long pig.

4198
03:47:44,930 --> 03:47:45,990
What do you mean weird?

4199
03:47:47,350 --> 03:47:48,350
What do you mean?

4200
03:47:48,730 --> 03:47:49,470
Who's weird?

4201
03:47:55,510 --> 03:47:55,930
Bats.

4202
03:47:56,010 --> 03:47:56,730
Oh, no.

4203
03:47:56,790 --> 03:47:57,210
The bats!

4204
03:48:00,510 --> 03:48:01,630
That's such a cool...

4205
03:48:01,630 --> 03:48:02,970
That's the original angle, though.

4206
03:48:03,310 --> 03:48:05,370
That's such an awesome angle instead of this.

4207
03:48:07,250 --> 03:48:09,230
You can get the bats in full view.

4208
03:48:11,210 --> 03:48:12,370
This is cinema.

4209
03:48:12,650 --> 03:48:14,150
This is a cinematic, you know.

4210
03:48:15,410 --> 03:48:15,830
Sorry.

4211
03:48:15,890 --> 03:48:16,630
I like going back and forth.

4212
03:48:16,650 --> 03:48:17,450
Between them.

4213
03:48:18,910 --> 03:48:20,010
Oh, you guys.

4214
03:48:21,670 --> 03:48:22,530
Oh, you guys.

4215
03:48:22,690 --> 03:48:22,890
Oh.

4216
03:48:25,230 --> 03:48:26,170
Oh, you guys.

4217
03:48:26,210 --> 03:48:26,910
I'm gonna be sick.

4218
03:48:27,090 --> 03:48:27,830
I'm gonna be sick.

4219
03:48:27,890 --> 03:48:28,530
I'm gonna be sick.

4220
03:48:31,970 --> 03:48:33,010
Saving the game, Snake?

4221
03:48:33,430 --> 03:48:33,630
Yeah.

4222
03:49:00,000 --> 03:49:03,260
Snake, have you ever seen the beast from 20,000 Fathoms?

4223
03:49:03,660 --> 03:49:05,120
What's up with 20,000?

4224
03:49:05,120 --> 03:49:07,800
It's about this monster that comes to life from 20,000 fathoms.

4225
03:49:07,800 --> 03:49:10,880
It's deep within a glacier as a result of an H-bomb test in the Arctic.

4226
03:49:11,280 --> 03:49:13,680
It crosses the ocean and emerges in New York.

4227
03:49:13,800 --> 03:49:13,900
Cool.

4228
03:49:14,680 --> 03:49:17,360
I especially like the scene where the monster attacks the lighthouse.

4229
03:49:17,640 --> 03:49:21,300
And the one where it pops out of a valley in Manhattan and makes a big hole in a building.

4230
03:49:21,520 --> 03:49:21,560
Spoilers.

4231
03:49:21,660 --> 03:49:22,100
Spoilers.

4232
03:49:22,100 --> 03:49:25,560
And the last scene on the green roller coaster was simply incredible.

4233
03:49:25,880 --> 03:49:26,320
Spoilers.

4234
03:49:26,580 --> 03:49:30,580
And because I saw it in a drive-in theater, I actually felt like I was a part of the movie.

4235
03:49:30,720 --> 03:49:30,780
Oh.

4236
03:49:31,280 --> 03:49:32,400
It's funny, isn't it?

4237
03:49:32,520 --> 03:49:35,740
How you can let yourself get absorbed into these things without thinking...

4238
03:49:35,740 --> 03:49:37,860
YouTube AI is stupid.

4239
03:49:38,100 --> 03:49:41,960
Distinguishing between what's real and what's not isn't always as simple as we think.

4240
03:49:42,820 --> 03:49:44,960
Well, don't get too absorbed in your mission.

4241
03:49:45,240 --> 03:49:47,260
It's important to take a rest every now and then.

4242
03:49:48,460 --> 03:49:49,440
Okay, Mei-Ling.

4243
03:49:56,140 --> 03:49:57,240
Let's see how Eva's doing.

4244
03:49:57,440 --> 03:49:57,820
Eva?

4245
03:49:59,520 --> 03:50:01,020
Put on your gear before you go?

4246
03:50:01,100 --> 03:50:01,680
Yeah, I know.

4247
03:50:02,060 --> 03:50:02,740
No response.

4248
03:50:02,840 --> 03:50:03,540
She's busy.

4249
03:50:07,960 --> 03:50:12,000
Follow that tunnel to the north and you'll come out inside Groznygrad.

4250
03:50:12,180 --> 03:50:13,180
Keep going north.

4251
03:50:14,820 --> 03:50:16,780
You could be fighting the furry.

4252
03:50:19,240 --> 03:50:19,720
Siggint.

4253
03:50:19,940 --> 03:50:20,420
Yo.

4254
03:50:20,680 --> 03:50:21,040
Yeah.

4255
03:50:21,380 --> 03:50:24,460
Eva said she set up a ground effect vehicle for us to make our escape.

4256
03:50:24,940 --> 03:50:25,140
Oh, yeah.

4257
03:50:25,140 --> 03:50:25,580
A wig.

4258
03:50:25,580 --> 03:50:26,200
So I heard.

4259
03:50:26,720 --> 03:50:28,500
The ground effect vehicle or wig...

4260
03:50:28,500 --> 03:50:29,400
Will you wear wigs?

4261
03:50:29,400 --> 03:50:30,940
...is something like a cross between an airplane...

4262
03:50:30,940 --> 03:50:31,340
Do you wear wigs?

4263
03:50:31,380 --> 03:50:31,860
...and a boat.

4264
03:50:32,020 --> 03:50:33,660
It uses ground effect to fly.

4265
03:50:34,540 --> 03:50:35,720
Ground effect basically means you can fly.

4266
03:50:35,720 --> 03:50:43,200
Ground effect basically means that when the craft skims the surface of the ground, the air between the ground and the wing is compressed, which gives the wing an extra boost.

4267
03:50:43,820 --> 03:50:50,120
From what Western intelligence agencies have been able to gather, the Russians are pretty serious about developing these wigs.

4268
03:50:50,600 --> 03:50:51,100
When will you wear wigs?

4269
03:50:51,100 --> 03:50:54,280
Apparently, they're planning on using them for anti-submarine patrols.

4270
03:50:54,740 --> 03:50:56,060
I guess I can see why.

4271
03:50:56,300 --> 03:51:01,360
The wigs' long cruising range and high-speed capabilities make it a good choice for that kind of mission.

4272
03:51:02,060 --> 03:51:05,700
Eva must have gotten her hands on one of the first prototypes while it was being built.

4273
03:51:06,720 --> 03:51:08,820
How do you just transport it?

4274
03:51:08,820 --> 03:51:11,280
The wing has a top speed of over 400 miles per hour.

4275
03:51:11,500 --> 03:51:12,520
But you stick it in your pocket?

4276
03:51:12,740 --> 03:51:12,860
And its range is pretty good, too.

4277
03:51:12,860 --> 03:51:14,260
Like, how do you get that here?

4278
03:51:14,260 --> 03:51:18,060
Not that speed is gonna help you if you've got a supersonic fighter jet on your tail.

4279
03:51:18,200 --> 03:51:22,340
But if you hug the surface and stay off the radar, you should have no problems getting away.

4280
03:51:24,680 --> 03:51:25,560
Oh, okay.

4281
03:51:27,620 --> 03:51:28,860
How do we just...

4282
03:51:29,920 --> 03:51:30,360
Okay.

4283
03:51:32,660 --> 03:51:33,100
Oh...

4284
03:51:37,380 --> 03:51:38,580
Well, I guess that's it.

4285
03:51:38,580 --> 03:51:39,620
I wish I could be Moss.

4286
03:51:40,100 --> 03:51:41,060
I'll go with the tires.

4287
03:51:41,180 --> 03:51:41,820
Oh, splitter.

4288
03:51:44,500 --> 03:51:44,940
And...

4289
03:51:45,480 --> 03:51:46,400
We'll go with...

4290
03:51:46,400 --> 03:51:47,260
Splitter, splitter!

4291
03:51:48,640 --> 03:51:49,560
Looks so good.

4292
03:51:50,220 --> 03:51:51,360
Oh my gosh.

4293
03:51:51,360 --> 03:51:52,580
It looks so good.

4294
03:51:54,320 --> 03:51:54,760
Okay.

4295
03:52:05,040 --> 03:52:06,040
Let's add a flashlight.

4296
03:52:08,660 --> 03:52:09,100
Why?

4297
03:52:09,960 --> 03:52:11,560
Why is it so hard?

4298
03:52:11,700 --> 03:52:15,140
And not that I'm gonna use them here or anything, but still, why is it so hard?

4299
03:52:15,920 --> 03:52:16,360
Oh, I see.

4300
03:52:22,040 --> 03:52:25,200
I love how they give you one ointment and one bandage.

4301
03:52:25,200 --> 03:52:25,820
Like, here you go.

4302
03:52:25,960 --> 03:52:26,720
That's all you need.

4303
03:52:27,320 --> 03:52:28,640
You put the boat in inventory.

4304
03:52:28,900 --> 03:52:29,340
It's simple.

4305
03:52:34,820 --> 03:52:35,220
Finally!

4306
03:52:39,720 --> 03:52:40,520
Oh gosh.

4307
03:52:40,700 --> 03:52:41,300
Oh gosh.

4308
03:52:41,400 --> 03:52:42,880
As soon as I go down there...

4309
03:52:50,680 --> 03:52:52,100
I don't wanna go.

4310
03:52:52,460 --> 03:52:53,180
I don't wanna go.

4311
03:53:02,980 --> 03:53:04,960
I'm just gonna get all my Blast-y weapons.

4312
03:53:06,900 --> 03:53:09,500
I'm just gonna get all my Blast-ing weapons, you know?

4313
03:53:10,040 --> 03:53:11,600
We'll keep that, just in case.

4314
03:53:12,320 --> 03:53:14,380
Oh wait, what was the thing that I picked up that was really good?

4315
03:53:15,820 --> 03:53:17,140
Well, we can keep the shotgun.

4316
03:53:17,740 --> 03:53:18,600
Was it the 63?

4317
03:53:18,840 --> 03:53:19,160
M63?

4318
03:53:24,650 --> 03:53:26,730
You've improved so much since then, you got this, Minto?

4319
03:53:26,910 --> 03:53:27,390
Thank you!

4320
03:53:28,330 --> 03:53:28,930
Thank you!

4321
03:53:30,010 --> 03:53:31,190
M63, yeah yeah, okay.

4322
03:53:33,050 --> 03:53:33,810
We'll take...

4323
03:53:33,810 --> 03:53:34,890
Oh okay, just kidding.

4324
03:53:36,930 --> 03:53:38,290
What's a WP grenade?

4325
03:53:39,790 --> 03:53:40,570
Wait, what is that?

4326
03:53:44,420 --> 03:53:45,020
What is that?

4327
03:53:45,140 --> 03:53:47,720
Looks like I got here just in time for a fire, fire, fire.

4328
03:53:52,500 --> 03:53:53,640
Fire grenade, oh!

4329
03:53:54,120 --> 03:53:54,740
That's crazy.

4330
03:53:56,660 --> 03:53:57,600
Let's get rid of our book.

4331
03:53:59,020 --> 03:54:01,040
Take the SVD, I guess I could do that too.

4332
03:54:01,460 --> 03:54:03,100
Oh yeah, probably would be good to...

4333
03:54:03,820 --> 03:54:06,460
do that from far away and get them from as far as I can.

4334
03:54:12,750 --> 03:54:14,070
I'm getting a stomach ache.

4335
03:54:15,310 --> 03:54:17,130
I am... I am...

4336
03:54:17,130 --> 03:54:21,210
I am... I am not looking forward to this so much.

4337
03:54:21,210 --> 03:54:23,430
I'm getting a stomach ache, oh god.

4338
03:55:00,120 --> 03:55:01,900
You say welcome to Ravager, thank you!

4339
03:55:17,230 --> 03:55:19,430
Oh, you look so cool though.

4340
03:55:21,770 --> 03:55:23,390
Yeah, kill the bats!

4341
03:55:23,490 --> 03:55:24,290
Kill the bats!

4342
03:55:33,060 --> 03:55:35,480
I am the fury!

4343
03:55:36,160 --> 03:55:39,520
The flames of my rage will incinerate you.

4344
03:55:39,640 --> 03:55:42,740
I know, I also am filled with rage.

4345
03:55:42,840 --> 03:55:42,860
I can't face.

4346
03:55:44,840 --> 03:55:47,580
As I returned, I had one vision.

4347
03:55:47,880 --> 03:55:49,720
The world set ablaze.

4348
03:55:49,720 --> 03:55:52,120
Maybe the theory and I have more in common.

4349
03:55:55,540 --> 03:55:56,420
What'd you see?

4350
03:55:57,720 --> 03:55:58,320
Fury!

4351
03:55:58,600 --> 03:55:58,900
Yeah!

4352
03:56:04,960 --> 03:56:06,300
He's blastin' off!

4353
03:56:06,400 --> 03:56:08,040
A grace, a terrible fury at being alive.

4354
03:56:11,760 --> 03:56:16,800
Now, you're going to feel the scorching heat of that horrible blackness.

4355
03:56:26,780 --> 03:56:27,760
God, no!

4356
03:56:27,980 --> 03:56:29,280
God, please, no!

4357
03:56:29,280 --> 03:56:31,420
I don't want to do it!

4358
03:56:31,600 --> 03:56:32,080
No!

4359
03:56:33,820 --> 03:56:35,640
I don't want to do this!

4360
03:56:39,980 --> 03:56:40,800
Where is he?

4361
03:57:01,450 --> 03:57:03,850
I can't which... tell which way he's coming by.

4362
03:57:06,550 --> 03:57:07,850
Oh, there he is.

4363
03:57:08,530 --> 03:57:09,570
Oh, there he is.

4364
03:57:10,690 --> 03:57:11,710
Oh my gosh.

4365
03:57:12,670 --> 03:57:14,230
I'm... you guys, I'm freezing up.

4366
03:57:15,710 --> 03:57:16,870
I'm freezing up!

4367
03:57:16,890 --> 03:57:17,650
I'm freezing up!

4368
03:57:21,290 --> 03:57:23,790
I think he's coming down this... I can't tell if he turned.

4369
03:57:25,510 --> 03:57:26,990
The music is so awesome.

4370
03:57:29,330 --> 03:57:31,650
It's a little like MGS2.

4371
03:57:35,830 --> 03:57:37,470
Why is my suffering cute?

4372
03:57:43,700 --> 03:57:45,580
I don't remember what the strat is here.

4373
03:57:47,880 --> 03:57:48,980
So, we'll just...

4374
03:57:51,000 --> 03:57:51,600
Blast him.

4375
03:58:06,100 --> 03:58:06,460
Oh!

4376
03:58:06,580 --> 03:58:07,080
Oh my gosh.

4377
03:58:18,670 --> 03:58:19,370
Did he see me?

4378
03:58:49,120 --> 03:59:00,140
Is he coming down the same...?

4379
03:59:00,140 --> 03:59:00,740
Oh, there he is.

4380
03:59:01,080 --> 03:59:03,700
Wait, I can maybe get him from...

4381
03:59:04,600 --> 03:59:05,260
Wait, shoot.

4382
03:59:05,820 --> 03:59:07,240
Where are you hiding?

4383
03:59:07,800 --> 03:59:08,760
Could he see me?

4384
03:59:08,860 --> 03:59:09,340
Like this?

4385
03:59:09,420 --> 03:59:10,560
Oh, uh... wait.

4386
03:59:15,190 --> 03:59:15,910
Like this?

4387
03:59:20,790 --> 03:59:21,310
Ow!

4388
03:59:22,890 --> 03:59:23,850
You bastard.

4389
03:59:28,190 --> 03:59:30,630
I forgot completely that there's an area over there.

4390
03:59:33,570 --> 03:59:34,650
He took off...

4391
03:59:35,170 --> 03:59:37,510
He took off right as I was trying to get him.

4392
03:59:37,510 --> 03:59:38,230
That's crazy.

4393
03:59:41,210 --> 03:59:42,790
Just missed him, I know.

4394
03:59:45,350 --> 03:59:46,190
Oh my gosh.

4395
03:59:50,980 --> 03:59:54,900
I'm gonna go as... I'm gonna take it kinda nice, slow and easy, you know?

4396
03:59:55,300 --> 03:59:56,760
Cause I'm nervous, so...

4397
03:59:56,760 --> 03:59:57,660
I saw him.

4398
03:59:57,660 --> 03:59:58,420
I saw him walk by.

4399
03:59:58,840 --> 03:59:59,620
That window.

4400
04:00:00,320 --> 04:00:01,580
Right there in the corner... Oh.

4401
04:00:01,900 --> 04:00:02,640
Oh my gosh.

4402
04:00:17,180 --> 04:00:17,840
Don't do it.

4403
04:00:21,500 --> 04:00:22,720
OG camera's good here?

4404
04:00:22,720 --> 04:00:25,140
Oh, I think I'm... I think I'm... I think I'm... I think I'm gonna...

4405
04:00:25,140 --> 04:00:26,480
Not right now.

4406
04:00:27,460 --> 04:00:28,020
Don't do it.

4407
04:00:39,020 --> 04:00:39,920
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

4408
04:00:40,800 --> 04:00:41,160
Oh.

4409
04:00:43,910 --> 04:00:44,390
Ouchie, ouch.

4410
04:00:44,930 --> 04:00:45,770
Get out of the fire.

4411
04:00:46,890 --> 04:00:48,190
Probably should get out of the fire.

4412
04:00:48,970 --> 04:00:49,990
I tried to kill him again.

4413
04:00:50,130 --> 04:00:51,610
I tried to get him more, but you know, whatever.

4414
04:00:53,430 --> 04:00:53,790
Burns.

4415
04:00:55,630 --> 04:00:56,350
My ointment.

4416
04:00:58,410 --> 04:00:59,130
My ointment.

4417
04:01:00,330 --> 04:01:01,690
And my bandage.

4418
04:01:07,410 --> 04:01:07,770
Get.

4419
04:01:08,890 --> 04:01:09,470
Oh my gosh.

4420
04:01:09,510 --> 04:01:09,970
Oh my gosh.

4421
04:01:10,030 --> 04:01:10,270
Wait.

4422
04:01:10,410 --> 04:01:11,230
I need a new spot.

4423
04:01:12,290 --> 04:01:13,010
Everything's on fire.

4424
04:01:13,790 --> 04:01:14,710
I need a new spot.

4425
04:01:17,890 --> 04:01:19,850
Can you, like, not set things on fire?

4426
04:01:19,950 --> 04:01:20,170
Wait.

4427
04:01:20,210 --> 04:01:20,510
Hold on.

4428
04:01:20,630 --> 04:01:20,890
Um.

4429
04:01:24,290 --> 04:01:25,030
Where are the...

4430
04:01:25,030 --> 04:01:25,410
Like this.

4431
04:01:25,490 --> 04:01:25,790
There we go.

4432
04:01:27,290 --> 04:01:27,650
Wait.

4433
04:01:28,570 --> 04:01:29,270
Why didn't it...

4434
04:01:29,270 --> 04:01:29,890
Why didn't it...

4435
04:01:29,890 --> 04:01:30,490
Is it this one?

4436
04:01:32,150 --> 04:01:33,370
Aren't they supposed to, like...

4437
04:01:33,370 --> 04:01:33,990
Fury.

4438
04:01:34,410 --> 04:01:34,770
Fury.

4439
04:01:35,290 --> 04:01:35,630
Oh.

4440
04:01:35,630 --> 04:01:38,030
Aren't they supposed to spit water?

4441
04:01:41,590 --> 04:01:42,710
Why didn't it...

4442
04:01:43,850 --> 04:01:44,850
Wrong pipes.

4443
04:01:45,110 --> 04:01:45,250
Oh.

4444
04:01:45,630 --> 04:01:46,730
It needs to be lethal.

4445
04:01:46,950 --> 04:01:47,890
This is lethal.

4446
04:01:52,780 --> 04:01:53,300
No.

4447
04:01:53,320 --> 04:01:54,140
I used the shooty gun.

4448
04:01:54,760 --> 04:01:55,100
Oh.

4449
04:01:55,100 --> 04:01:56,200
Let me turn off my suppressor though.

4450
04:01:56,600 --> 04:01:58,000
It's not the tranquilizer.

4451
04:01:58,180 --> 04:01:58,920
It's like you...

4452
04:01:58,920 --> 04:02:01,140
I put my tranquilizer away, you guys.

4453
04:02:01,200 --> 04:02:02,120
It's not the tranquilizer.

4454
04:02:15,040 --> 04:02:15,980
Different pipes.

4455
04:02:16,200 --> 04:02:16,640
Okay.

4456
04:02:17,740 --> 04:02:18,740
Where is he?

4457
04:02:18,820 --> 04:02:19,000
Where is he?

4458
04:02:29,160 --> 04:02:29,820
Oh my god.

4459
04:02:29,880 --> 04:02:30,420
There he is.

4460
04:02:44,590 --> 04:02:45,510
Oh my god.

4461
04:02:45,570 --> 04:02:45,790
Oh.

4462
04:02:45,970 --> 04:02:46,650
Oh my god.

4463
04:02:53,460 --> 04:02:54,100
Where is he?

4464
04:02:54,260 --> 04:02:54,500
Ah!

4465
04:02:55,740 --> 04:02:56,520
Oh no!

4466
04:02:56,720 --> 04:02:56,980
No!

4467
04:02:57,020 --> 04:02:58,040
I got stuck on the wall!

4468
04:02:58,760 --> 04:02:59,160
No!

4469
04:02:59,440 --> 04:02:59,840
Snake!

4470
04:02:59,920 --> 04:03:00,140
Snake!

4471
04:03:00,160 --> 04:03:00,340
Snake!

4472
04:03:00,340 --> 04:03:00,480
Snake!

4473
04:03:00,600 --> 04:03:03,040
I got stuck on the wall.

4474
04:03:03,420 --> 04:03:04,420
Oh my gosh.

4475
04:03:04,540 --> 04:03:04,760
Oh.

4476
04:03:05,220 --> 04:03:05,620
Food.

4477
04:03:05,680 --> 04:03:05,880
Food.

4478
04:03:05,960 --> 04:03:06,140
Food.

4479
04:03:06,160 --> 04:03:06,380
Food.

4480
04:03:06,560 --> 04:03:06,960
Food.

4481
04:03:07,480 --> 04:03:07,880
Food.

4482
04:03:07,880 --> 04:03:08,040
Food.

4483
04:03:08,080 --> 04:03:08,300
Huh.

4484
04:03:10,300 --> 04:03:11,600
My shoe's been ripped.

4485
04:03:12,780 --> 04:03:13,220
Yeah.

4486
04:03:13,280 --> 04:03:13,520
I know.

4487
04:03:15,580 --> 04:03:16,020
Where

4488
04:03:38,610 --> 04:03:38,890
are you?

4489
04:03:38,910 --> 04:03:39,090
Oh.

4490
04:03:39,110 --> 04:03:39,570
There you are.

4491
04:03:39,790 --> 04:03:40,230
Uh.

4492
04:03:41,690 --> 04:03:42,130
Anyways.

4493
04:03:42,230 --> 04:03:42,970
Let's start blasting.

4494
04:03:49,410 --> 04:03:50,410
Oh my god.

4495
04:03:50,490 --> 04:03:51,010
Oh my god.

4496
04:03:51,090 --> 04:03:51,410
That was close.

4497
04:03:57,980 --> 04:03:59,120
Stop following me!

4498
04:04:08,440 --> 04:04:08,880
Where?

4499
04:04:08,980 --> 04:04:09,280
We're over where?

4500
04:04:09,720 --> 04:04:10,440
Under where?

4501
04:04:10,660 --> 04:04:11,480
Under where?

4502
04:04:11,580 --> 04:04:12,020
Under where?

4503
04:04:19,840 --> 04:04:20,920
He didn't see me, right?

4504
04:04:21,640 --> 04:04:22,160
Ow!

4505
04:04:22,340 --> 04:04:24,160
My god, it goes through the walls!

4506
04:04:24,420 --> 04:04:26,220
Oh my god, that's so unfair.

4507
04:04:29,320 --> 04:04:30,340
Please, snake.

4508
04:04:41,420 --> 04:04:42,380
Holy cow.

4509
04:04:44,260 --> 04:04:44,780
Bandage.

4510
04:04:45,820 --> 04:04:46,560
Wait a minute.

4511
04:04:47,420 --> 04:04:48,880
I need to heal more.

4512
04:04:49,760 --> 04:04:51,160
I need to heal more.

4513
04:04:51,960 --> 04:04:53,180
I'm gonna eat...

4514
04:04:53,940 --> 04:04:55,380
I'm gonna eat...

4515
04:04:58,360 --> 04:05:00,420
I don't have anything that's like small.

4516
04:05:00,900 --> 04:05:02,080
The poison dart frog.

4517
04:05:12,700 --> 04:05:13,820
Tell it all where he's at.

4518
04:05:26,100 --> 04:05:27,160
Oh my gosh, there he is.

4519
04:05:32,940 --> 04:05:33,580
Oh gosh.

4520
04:05:42,180 --> 04:05:44,340
I'm trying to go to places that don't...

4521
04:05:45,220 --> 04:05:45,700
Where?

4522
04:05:46,840 --> 04:05:47,320
Where?

4523
04:05:56,350 --> 04:05:57,850
I gotta eat something.

4524
04:05:58,010 --> 04:05:58,290
I mean...

4525
04:05:58,390 --> 04:05:59,810
I gotta like get my health up.

4526
04:06:00,310 --> 04:06:01,830
We don't eat those instant noodles.

4527
04:06:02,030 --> 04:06:02,490
It's fine.

4528
04:06:04,990 --> 04:06:05,890
I know, I know.

4529
04:06:05,990 --> 04:06:06,950
I know you like that.

4530
04:06:08,230 --> 04:06:09,370
I have no life metal.

4531
04:06:10,430 --> 04:06:11,170
Fuck you!

4532
04:06:26,130 --> 04:06:27,130
Oh my god, snake, go up.

4533
04:06:27,290 --> 04:06:28,030
Go up, go up, go up, go up.

4534
04:06:30,630 --> 04:06:31,010
Snake!

4535
04:06:37,600 --> 04:06:39,800
I'm not recovering enough health.

4536
04:06:40,600 --> 04:06:41,700
I'm not recovering...

4537
04:06:54,920 --> 04:06:55,300
Wait.

4538
04:06:55,700 --> 04:06:56,020
Oh.

4539
04:06:56,660 --> 04:06:57,880
Is there anything in my backpack?

4540
04:07:00,640 --> 04:07:01,280
Life med!

4541
04:07:05,080 --> 04:07:05,740
Where are you?

4542
04:07:08,500 --> 04:07:09,200
Where is it?

4543
04:07:10,800 --> 04:07:11,300
I see...

4544
04:07:11,300 --> 04:07:11,640
Oh, there it is.

4545
04:07:11,760 --> 04:07:12,200
The first thing.

4546
04:07:15,180 --> 04:07:15,980
Oh, I did have it.

4547
04:07:16,320 --> 04:07:16,980
Okay, just kidding.

4548
04:07:17,620 --> 04:07:18,480
I already had it equipped.

4549
04:07:34,310 --> 04:07:36,190
Oh my god, this guy has one HP left.

4550
04:07:36,450 --> 04:07:36,890
Where are you hiding?

4551
04:07:37,010 --> 04:07:37,170
Where?

4552
04:07:37,350 --> 04:07:37,570
Okay.

4553
04:07:37,570 --> 04:07:39,170
Come here, come here, come here.

4554
04:07:39,990 --> 04:07:42,010
Wait, this guy has literally one HP left.

4555
04:07:43,090 --> 04:07:43,830
Fury, please.

4556
04:07:45,310 --> 04:07:45,790
.

4557
04:08:19,180 --> 04:08:19,660
.

4558
04:08:19,660 --> 04:08:20,120
.

4559
04:08:20,120 --> 04:08:20,200
.

4560
04:08:21,640 --> 04:08:22,120
.

4561
04:08:31,580 --> 04:08:32,060
.

4562
04:08:54,130 --> 04:08:56,250
I need a snack.

4563
04:09:01,170 --> 04:09:02,490
Die bastard.

4564
04:09:03,230 --> 04:09:04,490
This is revenge.

4565
04:09:04,930 --> 04:09:06,110
This is revenge!

4566
04:09:08,610 --> 04:09:10,510
All those years ago...

4567
04:09:12,450 --> 04:09:14,570
Ground Control Command.

4568
04:09:21,800 --> 04:09:23,240
Snake get out of there!

4569
04:09:23,600 --> 04:09:24,560
He's gonna...

4570
04:09:40,520 --> 04:09:43,480
His spirit... is too angry.

4571
04:09:57,640 --> 04:09:58,640
Part 2!

4572
04:09:58,740 --> 04:10:00,300
Okay, phase two of the battle everybody.

4573
04:10:03,440 --> 04:10:04,120
Can

4574
04:10:07,210 --> 04:10:08,130
you imagine?

4575
04:10:08,810 --> 04:10:09,430
The FURI!

4576
04:10:20,430 --> 04:10:21,930
What the FURI?

4577
04:10:25,850 --> 04:10:26,530
Whoa!

4578
04:10:26,910 --> 04:10:27,590
What the FURI?

4579
04:10:28,390 --> 04:10:29,430
Oh my god!

4580
04:10:30,490 --> 04:10:30,950
Yeah!

4581
04:10:32,170 --> 04:10:33,190
Oh my god!

4582
04:10:33,470 --> 04:10:35,270
I actually did it first try.

4583
04:10:36,330 --> 04:10:39,910
I don't know if you guys know, but that fight... used to take me hours.

4584
04:10:40,410 --> 04:10:41,490
Oh my god!

4585
04:10:41,930 --> 04:10:43,790
I actually did it first try!

4586
04:10:45,150 --> 04:10:46,250
Guys, am I a gamer?

4587
04:10:49,470 --> 04:10:50,590
Oh my god!

4588
04:10:52,350 --> 04:10:53,530
Come here, little rat.

4589
04:10:58,540 --> 04:10:59,580
Oh my god.

4590
04:11:00,860 --> 04:11:01,420
Oh.

4591
04:11:01,420 --> 04:11:01,620
Oh.

4592
04:11:01,640 --> 04:11:02,700
It's too fast.

4593
04:11:03,260 --> 04:11:04,000
Come here.

4594
04:11:09,880 --> 04:11:10,440
Rat!

4595
04:11:12,100 --> 04:11:13,600
Oh my god!

4596
04:11:14,600 --> 04:11:15,760
Oh my god.

4597
04:11:16,020 --> 04:11:17,420
I'm still shaking though.

4598
04:11:17,960 --> 04:11:18,860
Oh my god.

4599
04:11:18,880 --> 04:11:19,520
What if I just fell?

4600
04:11:22,080 --> 04:11:24,240
I could land onto that platform down there.

4601
04:11:26,980 --> 04:11:27,540
Rat!

4602
04:11:28,340 --> 04:11:29,340
Oh, another one.

4603
04:11:33,420 --> 04:11:34,040
Oh, another one.

4604
04:11:34,060 --> 04:11:34,800
I'll do it again.

4605
04:11:34,840 --> 04:11:35,420
Non-lethal.

4606
04:11:35,620 --> 04:11:48,000
Look, if I wasn't on like survival horror game mode with my... with my... with my tranq bullets right now, I would... you're getting stronger.

4607
04:11:48,300 --> 04:11:49,440
I'm getting stronger.

4608
04:11:50,440 --> 04:11:51,520
Oh my gosh.

4609
04:11:52,000 --> 04:11:53,140
Was not bad.

4610
04:11:56,900 --> 04:11:57,880
Little rat.

4611
04:12:01,640 --> 04:12:02,280
Okay.

4612
04:12:02,420 --> 04:12:03,460
Now let's...

4613
04:12:03,460 --> 04:12:03,940
Okay.

4614
04:12:05,620 --> 04:12:06,180
We can...

4615
04:12:06,180 --> 04:12:07,840
Get our guns.

4616
04:12:08,020 --> 04:12:08,460
Oh, whoops.

4617
04:12:09,760 --> 04:12:10,720
Keep this.

4618
04:12:11,800 --> 04:12:12,420
You.

4619
04:12:12,620 --> 04:12:13,020
You.

4620
04:12:13,880 --> 04:12:14,500
We'll...

4621
04:12:14,500 --> 04:12:15,040
You.

4622
04:12:16,140 --> 04:12:17,040
We'll keep you.

4623
04:12:17,480 --> 04:12:18,100
You.

4624
04:12:18,860 --> 04:12:19,480
You.

4625
04:12:24,410 --> 04:12:25,190
And you.

4626
04:12:26,230 --> 04:12:27,350
That's eight out of eight.

4627
04:12:27,450 --> 04:12:27,550
Yeah.

4628
04:12:27,630 --> 04:12:28,110
Okay.

4629
04:12:29,250 --> 04:12:29,870
And...

4630
04:12:30,890 --> 04:12:32,750
I think we're good here.

4631
04:12:36,230 --> 04:12:37,310
Oh my gosh.

4632
04:12:37,910 --> 04:12:39,050
That life...

4633
04:12:39,050 --> 04:12:39,970
Thanks for reminding me of that.

4634
04:12:39,970 --> 04:12:40,810
Thanks for reminding me about the life stuff.

4635
04:12:40,930 --> 04:12:42,190
I always forget because...

4636
04:12:45,330 --> 04:12:47,170
Because it's not like a...

4637
04:12:47,650 --> 04:12:49,330
It's not like regular rations, you know?

4638
04:12:49,550 --> 04:12:54,970
I feel like the Fury could have survived and went home if he didn't act like such a goober and turn himself into a flaming face thing.

4639
04:12:55,450 --> 04:12:56,230
I don't know.

4640
04:12:58,750 --> 04:13:01,250
All of them, I guess, could have gone home, right?

4641
04:13:02,950 --> 04:13:03,830
Ooh, it's cold.

4642
04:13:04,930 --> 04:13:06,810
Fury is either easy or hard.

4643
04:13:06,870 --> 04:13:07,450
No in between.

4644
04:13:08,030 --> 04:13:08,470
Yeah.

4645
04:13:09,490 --> 04:13:10,890
We did it.

4646
04:13:11,010 --> 04:13:11,670
Oh my gosh.

4647
04:13:13,250 --> 04:13:14,530
Oh my gosh.

4648
04:13:15,870 --> 04:13:17,290
I can't believe it.

4649
04:13:18,330 --> 04:13:19,450
He did go home.

4650
04:13:19,490 --> 04:13:19,710
Yeah.

4651
04:13:19,770 --> 04:13:21,690
He said, I'm going home.

4652
04:13:24,090 --> 04:13:25,050
Oh my god.

4653
04:13:30,440 --> 04:13:32,020
I can't believe I beat him.

4654
04:13:33,200 --> 04:13:34,400
In the first try.

4655
04:13:36,640 --> 04:13:38,900
That's been every boss' first try.

4656
04:13:39,880 --> 04:13:41,180
I think really...

4657
04:13:41,180 --> 04:13:41,840
Actually, the...

4658
04:13:41,840 --> 04:13:42,180
The...

4659
04:13:42,180 --> 04:13:42,500
The...

4660
04:13:42,520 --> 04:13:44,160
Maybe the...

4661
04:13:44,920 --> 04:13:45,420
Fear...

4662
04:13:45,420 --> 04:13:45,900
No, not fear.

4663
04:13:46,200 --> 04:13:48,280
The pain has caused me the most grief.

4664
04:13:49,060 --> 04:13:50,540
He's the one that took me the longest.

4665
04:13:51,140 --> 04:13:53,020
You got pretty good at this.

4666
04:13:55,760 --> 04:13:56,260
Yippee!

4667
04:13:59,520 --> 04:14:00,380
Oh, wow.

4668
04:14:00,700 --> 04:14:01,580
I just went...

4669
04:14:01,580 --> 04:14:03,060
I had him.

4670
04:14:03,540 --> 04:14:07,480
I can't believe he's holding on to one HP for so long.

4671
04:14:08,020 --> 04:14:08,940
And that...

4672
04:14:08,940 --> 04:14:09,280
Wait.

4673
04:14:09,320 --> 04:14:10,000
Wasn't the...

4674
04:14:10,000 --> 04:14:10,440
Oh.

4675
04:14:12,000 --> 04:14:12,500
Oh.

4676
04:14:12,500 --> 04:14:16,700
I think this is the best camouflage we can have.

4677
04:14:20,080 --> 04:14:22,640
I like to have the splinter face with the splinter body.

4678
04:14:22,880 --> 04:14:23,140
Okay.

4679
04:14:23,200 --> 04:14:24,040
This is a bit good enough.

4680
04:14:25,220 --> 04:14:27,260
And I can't believe I missed so many times.

4681
04:14:30,360 --> 04:14:32,120
I was trying to shoot him.

4682
04:14:32,420 --> 04:14:34,280
You've finally made it inside Grozingrad.

4683
04:14:34,280 --> 04:14:35,860
I finally made it inside Grozingrad.

4684
04:14:35,920 --> 04:14:36,200
Finally.

4685
04:14:36,800 --> 04:14:37,500
Stay alert.

4686
04:14:37,660 --> 04:14:39,240
This is the enemy's main base.

4687
04:14:39,760 --> 04:14:42,480
Security here is on a scale you haven't encountered yet.

4688
04:14:42,500 --> 04:14:43,020
Don't say that.

4689
04:14:43,160 --> 04:14:43,440
No kidding.

4690
04:14:44,060 --> 04:14:45,920
Your objective is the weapons lab.

4691
04:14:46,160 --> 04:14:48,380
It's the giant building in the center of the fortress.

4692
04:14:48,620 --> 04:14:48,880
Okay.

4693
04:14:49,000 --> 04:14:51,300
Sokolov is in the west wing of that building.

4694
04:14:51,420 --> 04:14:51,600
Okay.

4695
04:14:52,580 --> 04:14:55,520
To get into the area where Sokolov is imprisoned...

4696
04:14:55,520 --> 04:14:56,460
Now we gotta go find...

4697
04:14:56,460 --> 04:14:57,120
You'll need to find Major Rykov.

4698
04:14:57,300 --> 04:14:59,880
Steal his clothes and disguise yourself as him.

4699
04:14:59,940 --> 04:15:00,180
Yes.

4700
04:15:00,520 --> 04:15:03,300
Rykov is supposed to be in the east wing of the weapons lab.

4701
04:15:04,620 --> 04:15:07,860
Start out by sneaking into the east wing of the weapons lab.

4702
04:15:07,960 --> 04:15:10,600
Then neutralize Rykov and take his clothes.

4703
04:15:10,760 --> 04:15:11,440
Take his clothes.

4704
04:15:11,700 --> 04:15:12,480
The weapons lab is...

4705
04:15:12,500 --> 04:15:15,200
The weapons lab is to the northeast of the area you're in now.

4706
04:15:15,440 --> 04:15:16,320
Head northeast.

4707
04:15:18,380 --> 04:15:18,780
Gosh.

4708
04:15:18,800 --> 04:15:19,080
They...

4709
04:15:19,080 --> 04:15:19,360
Okay.

4710
04:15:19,440 --> 04:15:22,000
I'm thinking about it even more now with the moss camouflage.

4711
04:15:22,200 --> 04:15:23,880
They're just like, you can use it in the sun.

4712
04:15:24,160 --> 04:15:25,520
It'll replenish your stamina.

4713
04:15:25,740 --> 04:15:28,340
And I'm like, first of all, you give it right at the end of the forest.

4714
04:15:28,660 --> 04:15:29,300
Or sorry.

4715
04:15:29,420 --> 04:15:29,700
I'm sorry.

4716
04:15:29,780 --> 04:15:30,420
The jungles.

4717
04:15:30,480 --> 04:15:32,960
And then also, it's nighttime now.

4718
04:15:35,140 --> 04:15:38,220
This game is such a troll.

4719
04:15:39,140 --> 04:15:41,300
They're like, yeah, you have like the best camo now.

4720
04:15:41,300 --> 04:15:43,140
But also, you can't use it.

4721
04:15:43,340 --> 04:15:43,700
Like...

4722
04:15:46,400 --> 04:15:53,600
You ever think about how in the beginning, all the Cobra unit helped kidnap Sokolov, but the Fury isn't there?

4723
04:15:53,800 --> 04:15:55,420
Do you think they're all embarrassed by him?

4724
04:15:56,660 --> 04:15:59,160
He's too heavy for the plane.

4725
04:15:59,380 --> 04:16:00,580
Or for the helicopter they were in.

4726
04:16:00,800 --> 04:16:01,620
Never give up.

4727
04:16:01,640 --> 04:16:02,480
Fight until the end.

4728
04:16:02,560 --> 04:16:05,320
Always believe you will succeed.

4729
04:16:05,580 --> 04:16:07,120
Even when the odds are against you.

4730
04:16:08,140 --> 04:16:08,840
Those are...

4731
04:16:09,820 --> 04:16:10,260
Big...

4732
04:16:10,940 --> 04:16:11,700
Bosh's words.

4733
04:16:15,980 --> 04:16:16,900
I need a break.

4734
04:16:17,100 --> 04:16:19,100
Looks like you're wearing the Splitter pattern camo.

4735
04:16:19,100 --> 04:16:21,520
Let's just talk to some people while I eat a little bit.

4736
04:16:21,520 --> 04:16:24,580
Splitter was used quite a bit in World War II on German aircraft and stuff.

4737
04:16:25,080 --> 04:16:28,680
The pattern helped mask the plane's attitude and direction in dogfights.

4738
04:16:28,980 --> 04:16:32,060
Even now, it's still being used as camouflage in some places.

4739
04:16:32,820 --> 04:16:36,000
It works best when you wear it against a steel or stone background.

4740
04:16:38,060 --> 04:16:38,700
Oh, God.

4741
04:16:42,170 --> 04:16:43,790
Eat food to recover stamina.

4742
04:16:43,790 --> 04:16:44,230
That's what I'm doing.

4743
04:16:44,230 --> 04:16:45,070
Two.

4744
04:16:47,030 --> 04:16:49,810
Speaking of trolling, the Fury's camo makes you immune to fire.

4745
04:16:49,990 --> 04:16:51,610
That's so messed up.

4746
04:16:55,650 --> 04:16:58,570
Would it make you immune to like...

4747
04:16:58,570 --> 04:16:59,710
Not a grenade.

4748
04:16:59,830 --> 04:17:00,390
That's an explosion.

4749
04:17:14,180 --> 04:17:14,700
Ow.

4750
04:17:14,760 --> 04:17:15,360
Woke up.

4751
04:17:21,280 --> 04:17:21,800
Okay.

4752
04:17:23,440 --> 04:17:24,220
All right.

4753
04:17:24,260 --> 04:17:24,660
Let's see.

4754
04:17:24,760 --> 04:17:25,800
Where are we going?

4755
04:17:26,140 --> 04:17:26,800
Oh, wait.

4756
04:17:26,840 --> 04:17:27,240
Let me save.

4757
04:17:27,280 --> 04:17:27,500
Sorry.

4758
04:17:27,640 --> 04:17:28,340
I forgot to save.

4759
04:17:29,860 --> 04:17:30,380
Okay.

4760
04:17:30,380 --> 04:17:32,340
Do you want to save?

4761
04:17:32,820 --> 04:17:33,300
Yes.

4762
04:17:34,720 --> 04:17:35,660
Please, please, please.

4763
04:17:37,780 --> 04:17:38,720
Please let me save.

4764
04:17:38,940 --> 04:17:40,540
I do not want to fight him again.

4765
04:17:45,500 --> 04:17:46,360
Good crunch.

4766
04:17:46,380 --> 04:17:48,020
It's some of my snacks I got from Japan.

4767
04:17:48,280 --> 04:17:49,720
These ones are potato sticks.

4768
04:17:51,600 --> 04:17:53,640
They're Koi Kea Stick Potato.

4769
04:17:56,360 --> 04:17:57,320
It's a...

4770
04:17:58,260 --> 04:17:58,920
Just a...

4771
04:17:58,920 --> 04:18:00,200
Snake, have you seen the magnificent...

4772
04:18:00,200 --> 04:18:00,360
A snake?

4773
04:18:01,000 --> 04:18:01,880
It's just a flavor.

4774
04:18:02,100 --> 04:18:02,300
Sorry.

4775
04:18:02,300 --> 04:18:02,960
It's just potato flavor.

4776
04:18:03,120 --> 04:18:07,100
It's a remake of the Japanese classic, The Seven Samurai, only in a western setting.

4777
04:18:07,220 --> 04:18:08,460
Oh, she doesn't like it that much, then.

4778
04:18:08,480 --> 04:18:11,340
This tiny Mexican village is attacked every year by bandits.

4779
04:18:11,600 --> 04:18:12,260
That's so sad.

4780
04:18:12,280 --> 04:18:16,620
Finally, the village elder can't stand it any longer and decides to hire someone to protect the village.

4781
04:18:16,900 --> 04:18:17,160
Oh.

4782
04:18:17,360 --> 04:18:18,100
Do it yourself.

4783
04:18:18,280 --> 04:18:19,360
Seven gunmen respond to the call.

4784
04:18:19,520 --> 04:18:22,840
They teach the villagers how to shoot and prepare for the oncoming attack.

4785
04:18:23,620 --> 04:18:26,880
But then, the enemy shows up at the village with a huge band.

4786
04:18:27,440 --> 04:18:28,400
Then what happens?

4787
04:18:28,920 --> 04:18:30,340
You'll just have to see it for yourself.

4788
04:18:30,360 --> 04:18:31,800
Respect for playing on original hardware.

4789
04:18:31,920 --> 04:18:32,320
Thank you.

4790
04:18:32,540 --> 04:18:32,800
No.

4791
04:18:33,780 --> 04:18:36,340
Movies are only fun when you actually watch them.

4792
04:18:36,660 --> 04:18:38,680
They're something you have to experience for yourself.

4793
04:18:41,040 --> 04:18:43,480
The memory card, though, that I had, I don't think it's...

4794
04:18:43,480 --> 04:18:44,340
It's not mine.

4795
04:18:44,980 --> 04:18:46,160
I don't know whose it is.

4796
04:18:46,220 --> 04:18:46,940
It might be...

4797
04:18:47,560 --> 04:18:54,480
It might be, like, either my dad's or my sister's husband.

4798
04:18:54,620 --> 04:18:55,200
I don't know.

4799
04:18:57,240 --> 04:18:58,260
I don't know.

4800
04:18:58,260 --> 04:18:58,820
I don't know.

4801
04:18:59,000 --> 04:18:59,420
Uh...

4802
04:18:59,420 --> 04:19:01,620
Because I didn't...

4803
04:19:01,620 --> 04:19:02,960
I was like, these are not my games.

4804
04:19:04,320 --> 04:19:05,620
So, I just had it.

4805
04:19:06,280 --> 04:19:09,860
Could you imagine if Fury's helmet came off and he was a ridiculous Ikemen?

4806
04:19:15,680 --> 04:19:16,200
Let's see.

4807
04:19:16,320 --> 04:19:16,480
Oh.

4808
04:19:16,560 --> 04:19:17,340
Now the map.

4809
04:19:17,400 --> 04:19:17,600
Sorry.

4810
04:19:19,000 --> 04:19:19,780
I don't know.

4811
04:19:19,960 --> 04:19:20,360
Um...

4812
04:19:20,360 --> 04:19:20,860
Who's this is?

4813
04:19:21,240 --> 04:19:21,640
Whoa...

4814
04:19:22,440 --> 04:19:23,000
Zoom out?

4815
04:19:24,080 --> 04:19:24,480
Oh.

4816
04:19:24,700 --> 04:19:25,680
We can't zoom out?

4817
04:19:26,580 --> 04:19:28,600
We gotta go to the big building, right?

4818
04:19:29,160 --> 04:19:30,160
The big building!

4819
04:19:30,900 --> 04:19:32,000
What a way to end...

4820
04:19:32,000 --> 04:19:32,460
a night...

4821
04:19:32,460 --> 04:19:33,260
an off-season.

4822
04:19:33,460 --> 04:19:37,080
Kudos to me and the Wisps at Otake section at the Atrium for making my first ever concert.

4823
04:19:37,520 --> 04:19:37,880
Yep!

4824
04:19:37,940 --> 04:19:38,500
Oh, hype.

4825
04:19:38,600 --> 04:19:39,320
I thought you said yippee.

4826
04:19:40,280 --> 04:19:41,240
Marvel, thank you!

4827
04:19:41,320 --> 04:19:42,240
I'm so glad you had fun!

4828
04:19:43,380 --> 04:19:46,580
Now that the flamethrowers are dead, I hope you don't mind, but I wanted to check.

4829
04:19:46,680 --> 04:19:47,720
Should I use Phantography?

4830
04:19:47,840 --> 04:19:47,980
Oh!

4831
04:19:48,080 --> 04:19:48,540
That's right!

4832
04:19:48,620 --> 04:19:49,600
I'm sorry, Seymour.

4833
04:19:49,620 --> 04:19:52,280
You asked earlier and then I completely forgot to answer your question.

4834
04:19:52,860 --> 04:19:53,220
Um...

4835
04:19:53,980 --> 04:19:57,640
You could use Phantography or you could use the general hashtag, too.

4836
04:19:57,920 --> 04:19:58,540
Whichever works.

4837
04:20:00,800 --> 04:20:01,980
Now that we have Twitter and the whole thing, let's go.

4838
04:20:02,000 --> 04:20:03,780
Even though Kojima loves movies, Paramedic makes more sense.

4839
04:20:06,720 --> 04:20:07,520
We had...

4840
04:20:07,520 --> 04:20:09,060
We had GAME FAX before.

4841
04:20:09,320 --> 04:20:09,940
What are you talking about?

4842
04:20:10,240 --> 04:20:13,000
We had the GAME FAX telling us all the real information.

4843
04:20:18,440 --> 04:20:19,400
Please, Morran.

4844
04:20:20,020 --> 04:20:21,200
That's a smoke grenade.

4845
04:20:28,230 --> 04:20:31,190
I'm gonna just creep and crawl under here.

4846
04:20:37,900 --> 04:20:39,960
We're just gonna not be seen by this guy.

4847
04:20:40,840 --> 04:20:41,360
Hey...

4848
04:20:42,160 --> 04:20:42,940
Real quick.

4849
04:20:43,700 --> 04:20:45,360
Oh, he's coming real close.

4850
04:20:46,420 --> 04:20:48,080
He's right up on me.

4851
04:20:48,740 --> 04:20:53,720
Oh, let me also put my suppressors back on.

4852
04:20:55,540 --> 04:20:57,040
Okay, this one has a suppressor.

4853
04:20:59,060 --> 04:21:01,120
The T-Rex pose is so cute.

4854
04:21:01,260 --> 04:21:01,700
I know!

4855
04:21:03,700 --> 04:21:06,160
Gosh, he's just like me for real.

4856
04:21:09,500 --> 04:21:11,320
Oh Snake, you silly guy.

4857
04:21:13,300 --> 04:21:16,340
I wish I could see the other guy over here.

4858
04:21:19,220 --> 04:21:20,000
Oh, he's gone.

4859
04:21:20,620 --> 04:21:21,220
Where'd he go?

4860
04:21:28,060 --> 04:21:28,900
Can't see your head.

4861
04:21:29,300 --> 04:21:30,180
Can't see your head.

4862
04:21:31,780 --> 04:21:32,480
Got him.

4863
04:21:33,660 --> 04:21:34,100
We'll

4864
04:21:37,300 --> 04:21:37,940
loot him though.

4865
04:21:42,880 --> 04:21:44,580
There's dogs here too, aren't there?

4866
04:21:44,760 --> 04:21:45,740
Forgot about the dogs.

4867
04:21:52,070 --> 04:21:53,830
You know Kojima loves movies.

4868
04:21:54,170 --> 04:21:56,290
The character Snake comes from Escape from New York.

4869
04:21:56,450 --> 04:21:58,870
Yeah, the box art ripped from Terminator.

4870
04:22:00,230 --> 04:22:01,010
Oh wait, really?

4871
04:22:01,110 --> 04:22:02,350
I didn't know about the Terminator bit.

4872
04:22:03,790 --> 04:22:05,630
I know Escape from New York, obviously.

4873
04:22:09,610 --> 04:22:11,190
Maybe I shouldn't be so loud.

4874
04:22:12,030 --> 04:22:14,010
Maybe I should be quiet.

4875
04:22:18,160 --> 04:22:20,600
Okay, we gotta go like there-ish.

4876
04:22:25,580 --> 04:22:27,340
There's like stuff under here though, isn't there?

4877
04:22:27,420 --> 04:22:27,660
Probably.

4878
04:22:32,440 --> 04:22:34,120
There's all sorts of loot around here.

4879
04:22:35,200 --> 04:22:36,360
Oh, no, just kidding.

4880
04:22:36,500 --> 04:22:37,800
There's no loot around here.

4881
04:22:37,960 --> 04:22:38,700
I'm a liar.

4882
04:22:43,420 --> 04:22:44,320
Quiet is playable?

4883
04:22:44,580 --> 04:22:44,960
Yeah.

4884
04:22:45,980 --> 04:22:48,420
There's a secret bikini option.

4885
04:22:52,660 --> 04:22:54,160
Am I crazy or just quiet?

4886
04:22:54,300 --> 04:22:57,140
Quiet does have an Eva outfit, doesn't she?

4887
04:23:03,010 --> 04:23:04,050
Oh, oh, oh!

4888
04:23:04,130 --> 04:23:04,350
Who's that?

4889
04:23:04,570 --> 04:23:04,890
No.

4890
04:23:05,570 --> 04:23:06,350
Oh, shi-

4891
04:23:10,550 --> 04:23:14,440
What's going on?

4892
04:23:14,900 --> 04:23:15,260
No!

4893
04:23:43,650 --> 04:23:45,550
Oh, it's a sniper wolf outfit, that's right.

4894
04:23:45,690 --> 04:23:47,430
That would make more sense because she's a sniper, right?

4895
04:23:49,630 --> 04:23:51,550
Gosh, it really takes a lot to die, huh?

4896
04:23:54,270 --> 04:23:55,030
It's okay, Snake.

4897
04:23:56,190 --> 04:23:56,970
What about Snake?

4898
04:23:58,030 --> 04:23:59,750
Actually, I'm gonna use this time to walk around.

4899
04:24:00,330 --> 04:24:00,690
Bye!

4900
04:24:03,650 --> 04:24:04,450
Oh, my God!

4901
04:24:07,670 --> 04:24:09,050
You have a knife!

4902
04:24:11,390 --> 04:24:12,850
Let's check out the area.

4903
04:24:15,070 --> 04:24:15,990
Wait, is this working?

4904
04:24:16,270 --> 04:24:17,370
No way this is working.

4905
04:24:18,330 --> 04:24:19,770
Do not go into evasion.

4906
04:24:19,910 --> 04:24:20,590
No way.

4907
04:24:21,010 --> 04:24:21,870
Did this work?

4908
04:24:22,070 --> 04:24:22,850
Oh, my God.

4909
04:24:24,030 --> 04:24:24,870
What the hell?

4910
04:24:25,150 --> 04:24:26,250
Why is it so easy?

4911
04:24:33,030 --> 04:24:34,530
They're still on my ass, though.

4912
04:24:42,810 --> 04:24:43,630
Oh, my God.

4913
04:24:44,050 --> 04:24:44,930
Wait, who's on me?

4914
04:24:44,990 --> 04:24:45,530
Oh, my God.

4915
04:24:47,030 --> 04:24:47,390
Ouch!

4916
04:24:48,450 --> 04:24:48,810
Bye!

4917
04:24:49,950 --> 04:24:51,230
It's okay if I die, you guys.

4918
04:24:51,330 --> 04:24:52,730
I'm not trying to live, honestly.

4919
04:24:53,350 --> 04:24:54,070
The dogs!

4920
04:24:54,630 --> 04:24:55,690
Oh, my God, it's the dogs.

4921
04:24:59,490 --> 04:25:00,230
It's the dogs.

4922
04:25:01,750 --> 04:25:02,610
What if I go inside?

4923
04:25:03,390 --> 04:25:03,910
What if I go inside?

4924
04:25:06,850 --> 04:25:09,130
Snake is really just taking it, isn't he?

4925
04:25:09,350 --> 04:25:10,250
It's kind of impressive.

4926
04:25:14,250 --> 04:25:15,130
Oh, ouch.

4927
04:25:17,690 --> 04:25:18,450
Oh, he do.

4928
04:25:20,690 --> 04:25:21,150
Okay.

4929
04:25:25,050 --> 04:25:26,470
Okay, let's try that again.

4930
04:25:26,730 --> 04:25:27,930
That was all my fault.

4931
04:25:28,070 --> 04:25:30,290
I completely fumbled the holdup, so I feel...

4932
04:25:30,290 --> 04:25:30,410
Oh.

4933
04:25:30,410 --> 04:25:30,550
Oh.

4934
04:25:31,350 --> 04:25:31,850
Oh.

4935
04:25:33,090 --> 04:25:33,590
Oh.

4936
04:25:34,030 --> 04:25:34,150
Oh.

4937
04:25:34,150 --> 04:25:34,550
Oh.

4938
04:25:34,550 --> 04:25:35,970
Oh, I died in another area.

4939
04:25:36,190 --> 04:25:36,750
Oh, my God.

4940
04:25:37,050 --> 04:25:37,550
Wait.

4941
04:25:39,410 --> 04:25:39,910
Wait.

4942
04:25:40,530 --> 04:25:41,030
Wait.

4943
04:25:42,010 --> 04:25:43,030
This is not...

4944
04:25:43,630 --> 04:25:44,130
Okay.

4945
04:25:44,230 --> 04:25:46,390
I didn't actually want to...

4946
04:25:46,390 --> 04:25:47,190
Okay.

4947
04:25:48,090 --> 04:25:48,370
Um...

4948
04:25:52,010 --> 04:25:52,510
Uh...

4949
04:25:55,640 --> 04:25:56,140
Uh...

4950
04:25:57,140 --> 04:25:57,640
Disinfect?

4951
04:25:58,320 --> 04:26:00,020
I didn't actually want to use my staff.

4952
04:26:00,700 --> 04:26:01,320
Oh, well.

4953
04:26:08,890 --> 04:26:09,330
Okay.

4954
04:26:10,570 --> 04:26:11,010
Okay.

4955
04:26:15,370 --> 04:26:16,890
I see something over there.

4956
04:26:17,010 --> 04:26:17,350
I can't...

4957
04:26:17,350 --> 04:26:18,430
I think it's like the dog sleeping.

4958
04:26:25,760 --> 04:26:26,720
There's a spotlight.

4959
04:26:31,330 --> 04:26:32,270
Where are the people?

4960
04:26:32,450 --> 04:26:33,110
I'm gonna...

4961
04:26:33,110 --> 04:26:34,890
Sorry, I'm gonna thermal goggle real quick.

4962
04:26:36,370 --> 04:26:37,370
Oh, there's a purple.

4963
04:26:37,510 --> 04:26:38,070
There's the people.

4964
04:26:42,890 --> 04:26:43,330
Oh.

4965
04:26:45,270 --> 04:26:45,890
There you go.

4966
04:26:46,090 --> 04:26:46,530
Okay.

4967
04:26:47,530 --> 04:26:48,450
There's the people.

4968
04:26:51,070 --> 04:26:51,990
There's another people.

4969
04:26:52,990 --> 04:26:53,990
Can I...

4970
04:26:53,990 --> 04:26:54,970
Will they hear me?

4971
04:26:55,950 --> 04:26:57,710
If I were to do this?

4972
04:27:02,840 --> 04:27:05,460
Oh, the dogs definitely hear that.

4973
04:27:06,320 --> 04:27:07,440
But he's gonna go down.

4974
04:27:08,680 --> 04:27:09,760
And the dogs awake.

4975
04:27:10,040 --> 04:27:11,160
And the dogs...

4976
04:27:11,160 --> 04:27:11,980
Where's the dogs?

4977
04:27:12,480 --> 04:27:12,980
Oh.

4978
04:27:13,360 --> 04:27:13,880
Ow!

4979
04:27:13,960 --> 04:27:14,280
The dogs!

4980
04:27:14,380 --> 04:27:14,720
Ow!

4981
04:27:14,840 --> 04:27:15,220
The dogs!

4982
04:27:15,700 --> 04:27:16,260
The dogs!

4983
04:27:16,500 --> 04:27:18,600
The dogs!

4984
04:27:20,840 --> 04:27:22,080
That's the dogs.

4985
04:27:22,180 --> 04:27:22,220
The dogs.

4986
04:27:22,940 --> 04:27:23,420
The dogs!

4987
04:27:23,420 --> 04:27:23,480
The dogs!

4988
04:27:23,480 --> 04:27:24,280
I hate my life.

4989
04:27:24,420 --> 04:27:25,220
I hate my afterlife.

4990
04:27:25,500 --> 04:27:26,720
I hate my life-life.

4991
04:27:26,920 --> 04:27:27,180
I hate my life-life.

4992
04:27:27,180 --> 04:27:27,400
I hate everything.

4993
04:27:28,260 --> 04:27:29,120
Shut up, dog!

4994
04:27:29,440 --> 04:27:30,160
Shut up!

4995
04:27:31,540 --> 04:27:32,680
Why are there two of you?

4996
04:27:37,220 --> 04:27:39,100
Oh, uh, lesson learned.

4997
04:27:39,740 --> 04:27:40,840
Don't wake up the dog.

4998
04:27:43,680 --> 04:27:45,200
I remember going to school.

4999
04:27:45,220 --> 04:27:49,200
Going over here one time... and just waiting it out... kinda worked, actually.

5000
04:27:54,600 --> 04:27:55,500
You can't get me, dog!

5001
04:27:55,700 --> 04:27:56,360
You can't get me, dog!

5002
04:27:56,500 --> 04:27:57,220
You can't get me, dog!

5003
04:27:58,260 --> 04:27:59,240
You can't get me, dog!

5004
04:28:00,020 --> 04:28:00,920
You can't get me anybody.

5005
04:28:08,640 --> 04:28:09,220
Oh my gosh.

5006
04:28:09,280 --> 04:28:09,800
Wait, I'm stuck.

5007
04:28:10,100 --> 04:28:10,600
There we go.

5008
04:28:10,760 --> 04:28:11,360
A snake.

5009
04:28:11,560 --> 04:28:12,380
Wait, I'm actually stuck.

5010
04:28:12,760 --> 04:28:13,080
Hello?

5011
04:28:13,280 --> 04:28:13,880
There's a snake.

5012
04:28:14,000 --> 04:28:14,420
There we go.

5013
04:28:14,520 --> 04:28:15,200
Oh, I'm stuck.

5014
04:28:15,300 --> 04:28:15,620
There we go.

5015
04:28:16,580 --> 04:28:17,440
Can I go down here?

5016
04:28:23,050 --> 04:28:23,370
Evasion.

5017
04:28:27,530 --> 04:28:28,230
Yeah, you did.

5018
04:28:30,490 --> 04:28:32,210
Will you find him, though?

5019
04:28:33,130 --> 04:28:33,990
I'm in the pipes.

5020
04:28:34,190 --> 04:28:34,990
I'm in your walls.

5021
04:28:36,810 --> 04:28:38,210
Where the hell is this building?

5022
04:28:39,730 --> 04:28:40,950
Was it the one that I saw?

5023
04:28:42,230 --> 04:28:43,550
Or is it on the other side?

5024
04:28:43,770 --> 04:28:44,410
I can't remember.

5025
04:28:44,670 --> 04:28:44,950
Gosh.

5026
04:28:47,690 --> 04:28:48,410
Box time.

5027
04:28:49,650 --> 04:28:51,150
No, they can't come in here.

5028
04:28:51,570 --> 04:28:52,610
They're actually dumb.

5029
04:28:55,870 --> 04:28:57,130
Get in from another area.

5030
04:28:58,550 --> 04:28:59,170
Door's stuck.

5031
04:29:03,180 --> 04:29:05,020
This is where we go afterwards, isn't it?

5032
04:29:07,060 --> 04:29:08,080
The dog is asleep!

5033
04:29:13,260 --> 04:29:15,160
Aren't you supposed to be sniffing around for me?

5034
04:29:15,340 --> 04:29:16,820
Aren't you supposed to be doing your job, dog?

5035
04:29:21,100 --> 04:29:21,740
Stupid dog.

5036
04:29:21,740 --> 04:29:22,700
Oh!

5037
04:29:25,600 --> 04:29:26,540
Stupid dog.

5038
04:29:31,060 --> 04:29:33,580
Let me ask if this is the right area...

5039
04:29:33,580 --> 04:29:34,120
X-E-R-A!

5040
04:29:34,460 --> 04:29:41,760
To get into the area where Sokoliouf is imprisoned, you'll need to find Major Rykoff, steal his clothes, and disguise yourself as him.

5041
04:29:42,400 --> 04:29:45,160
Rykoff is supposed to be in the East Wing of the weapon's lab.

5042
04:29:45,620 --> 04:29:46,580
Eeeeeast wing.

5043
04:29:46,660 --> 04:29:49,140
Start out by sneaking into the East Wing of the Weapons Lab.

5044
04:29:49,140 --> 04:29:49,940
We're in the W-East wing.

5045
04:29:50,000 --> 04:29:50,060
We're in the W-East Wing.

5046
04:29:50,060 --> 04:29:52,360
Then neutralise Rykoff, and take his clothes.

5047
04:29:53,340 --> 04:29:56,620
The weapons lab is to the east of the area you're in now.

5048
04:29:56,740 --> 04:29:57,160
Okay.

5049
04:29:59,220 --> 04:30:00,400
Thank you, Colonel.

5050
04:30:00,700 --> 04:30:01,180
Major.

5051
04:30:01,300 --> 04:30:01,660
Sorry.

5052
04:30:12,680 --> 04:30:13,600
No one's around.

5053
04:30:14,260 --> 04:30:15,660
I think I can just sneak in.

5054
04:30:16,220 --> 04:30:17,140
Do I have any...

5055
04:30:19,340 --> 04:30:20,700
Any camo that's better?

5056
04:30:22,600 --> 04:30:23,080
Nope.

5057
04:30:23,760 --> 04:30:24,720
Splinter with Splinter.

5058
04:30:26,340 --> 04:30:27,060
My beloved.

5059
04:30:27,060 --> 04:30:27,240
My beloved.

5060
04:30:31,560 --> 04:30:32,600
Is it like the Gator?

5061
04:30:32,700 --> 04:30:33,500
Oh, no, no, no.

5062
04:30:33,620 --> 04:30:34,180
Wrong gun.

5063
04:30:34,420 --> 04:30:37,380
Oh my

5064
04:30:42,590 --> 04:30:42,770
gosh.

5065
04:30:43,830 --> 04:30:45,110
I got him out of the way at least.

5066
04:30:46,170 --> 04:30:46,530
Oh!

5067
04:30:46,530 --> 04:30:46,890
Nice!

5068
04:30:54,550 --> 04:30:54,910
East.

5069
04:30:57,330 --> 04:30:57,950
Oh my gosh.

5070
04:30:58,010 --> 04:30:58,850
I just saw that guy.

5071
04:31:03,730 --> 04:31:04,470
Crawly crawl crawl.

5072
04:31:04,950 --> 04:31:05,650
Sneaking mission.

5073
04:31:05,830 --> 04:31:06,390
Sneaking mission.

5074
04:31:12,210 --> 04:31:12,950
Sneaking mission.

5075
04:31:13,570 --> 04:31:15,150
Where's the door to the east?

5076
04:31:15,670 --> 04:31:16,990
I can't go in through this door.

5077
04:31:17,110 --> 04:31:17,510
Come on.

5078
04:31:32,320 --> 04:31:32,720
Nice.

5079
04:31:34,460 --> 04:31:35,720
We're in the clear, baby.

5080
04:31:39,800 --> 04:31:40,200
Snake.

5081
04:31:40,240 --> 04:31:40,640
Snake.

5082
04:31:40,780 --> 04:31:41,440
Can I get up there?

5083
04:31:44,960 --> 04:31:45,640
I'll take it.

5084
04:31:45,680 --> 04:31:45,880
I'll take

5085
04:31:49,080 --> 04:31:49,220
it.

5086
04:31:49,680 --> 04:31:51,140
Give me your food.

5087
04:31:51,760 --> 04:31:52,820
I'll take it though.

5088
04:31:52,880 --> 04:31:53,540
I will take it.

5089
04:31:54,020 --> 04:31:54,980
I will eat.

5090
04:31:55,280 --> 04:31:56,000
Right now.

5091
04:31:58,140 --> 04:31:59,840
I'll eat your nasty rations.

5092
04:32:01,680 --> 04:32:02,120
Sick.

5093
04:32:02,940 --> 04:32:04,040
I'm gonna throw up.

5094
04:32:05,100 --> 04:32:06,000
I'm gonna throw up.

5095
04:32:06,020 --> 04:32:06,360
So gross.

5096
04:32:09,840 --> 04:32:11,840
So I really can't go in through this door.

5097
04:32:13,540 --> 04:32:14,660
It really won't let me.

5098
04:32:20,680 --> 04:32:21,740
Not even if I knock.

5099
04:32:30,640 --> 04:32:31,300
Oh my god.

5100
04:32:31,320 --> 04:32:31,480
Wait.

5101
04:32:31,600 --> 04:32:32,180
Oh my god.

5102
04:32:32,200 --> 04:32:33,020
He's on one left.

5103
04:32:39,060 --> 04:32:39,800
Did I get him?

5104
04:32:45,700 --> 04:32:46,140
Uh...

5105
04:32:46,440 --> 04:32:46,540
Pressure?

5106
04:32:47,300 --> 04:32:47,760
There we go.

5107
04:32:47,860 --> 04:32:48,180
Nice.

5108
04:32:49,020 --> 04:32:49,340
Yeah.

5109
04:32:49,460 --> 04:32:50,080
I know the spotlight.

5110
04:32:50,340 --> 04:32:51,320
I'm looking out for it.

5111
04:32:51,420 --> 04:32:51,660
Okay.

5112
04:32:58,170 --> 04:32:58,490
Okay.

5113
04:32:58,530 --> 04:32:59,250
Let's go back.

5114
04:32:59,690 --> 04:33:00,870
The way we came.

5115
04:33:02,330 --> 04:33:02,890
I guess.

5116
04:33:07,250 --> 04:33:07,910
Let's go back.

5117
04:33:07,970 --> 04:33:08,770
The way we came.

5118
04:33:08,850 --> 04:33:09,390
I guess.

5119
04:33:11,570 --> 04:33:14,410
I had so much fun being part of the Hamtaro circle last night.

5120
04:33:14,470 --> 04:33:16,710
I wish I was still in that circle as I head off to work now.

5121
04:33:16,770 --> 04:33:17,550
Good luck with work.

5122
04:33:20,130 --> 04:33:21,010
Good luck.

5123
04:33:21,210 --> 04:33:21,450
Good luck.

5124
04:33:22,530 --> 04:33:22,970
Alrighty.

5125
04:33:24,270 --> 04:33:24,710
So...

5126
04:33:25,970 --> 04:33:26,410
East.

5127
04:33:29,450 --> 04:33:30,910
Can I go through this big door?

5128
04:33:31,530 --> 04:33:32,490
There was another door?

5129
04:33:32,650 --> 04:33:33,030
There was?

5130
04:33:33,730 --> 04:33:34,470
Are you sure?

5131
04:33:45,320 --> 04:33:45,760
Wait.

5132
04:33:45,780 --> 04:33:45,980
Yes.

5133
04:33:46,120 --> 04:33:46,620
Go back?

5134
04:33:46,840 --> 04:33:47,080
Okay.

5135
04:33:51,520 --> 04:33:52,540
I didn't see it.

5136
04:33:52,620 --> 04:33:53,000
Why are I?

5137
04:33:55,560 --> 04:33:57,880
There's a cute door I saw shaped like a male cow.

5138
04:34:00,600 --> 04:34:01,740
It was a door...

5139
04:34:01,740 --> 04:34:04,180
It was a door of a bull.

5140
04:34:04,540 --> 04:34:04,980
Huh?

5141
04:34:05,920 --> 04:34:06,560
Where is it?

5142
04:34:06,620 --> 04:34:07,600
That one right there?

5143
04:34:08,940 --> 04:34:09,380
Oh!

5144
04:34:09,520 --> 04:34:10,380
This one right here.

5145
04:34:12,420 --> 04:34:13,080
Thanks guys.

5146
04:34:13,100 --> 04:34:13,760
I'm a little blind.

5147
04:34:14,980 --> 04:34:15,860
Thanks guys.

5148
04:34:15,860 --> 04:34:15,860
I'm a little blind.

5149
04:34:15,860 --> 04:34:16,000
Oh!

5150
04:34:16,520 --> 04:34:16,960
Adorable!

5151
04:34:17,600 --> 04:34:18,040
Ah!

5152
04:34:20,160 --> 04:34:21,240
I get it.

5153
04:34:22,820 --> 04:34:23,620
Oh my goodness.

5154
04:34:25,720 --> 04:34:29,600
What a strange location to be starting at.

5155
04:34:39,400 --> 04:34:39,840
What a strange location to be starting at.

5156
04:34:39,840 --> 04:34:40,300
Anyone around?

5157
04:34:40,520 --> 04:34:43,040
Oh I see two guys.

5158
04:34:45,900 --> 04:34:46,900
That's where I...

5159
04:34:48,780 --> 04:34:49,820
That's where I need to go?

5160
04:34:49,900 --> 04:34:50,800
Maybe that door right there?

5161
04:35:00,160 --> 04:35:00,980
Oh gosh.

5162
04:35:01,140 --> 04:35:01,400
Aim.

5163
04:35:03,160 --> 04:35:04,100
Aim, aim, aim.

5164
04:35:05,200 --> 04:35:05,840
Got him.

5165
04:35:06,460 --> 04:35:07,200
What's wrong?

5166
04:35:11,130 --> 04:35:11,950
Anyone else?

5167
04:35:12,030 --> 04:35:12,770
Anyone else?

5168
04:35:12,910 --> 04:35:14,030
I'm looking, I'm looking.

5169
04:35:14,270 --> 04:35:14,790
Okay.

5170
04:35:15,330 --> 04:35:16,410
I'm gonna snipe him.

5171
04:35:17,290 --> 04:35:18,870
I'm gonna snipe him somehow.

5172
04:35:19,410 --> 04:35:20,530
Before he... Oh shit.

5173
04:35:21,010 --> 04:35:21,690
What's wrong?

5174
04:35:23,710 --> 04:35:24,390
Got him.

5175
04:35:24,930 --> 04:35:25,730
Anyone else?

5176
04:35:27,230 --> 04:35:27,750
Pepee!

5177
04:35:29,790 --> 04:35:30,310
Pepee!

5178
04:35:31,470 --> 04:35:32,490
I think we're good.

5179
04:35:34,990 --> 04:35:35,810
Oh my god.

5180
04:35:35,830 --> 04:35:36,630
Watch out for the...

5181
04:35:45,000 --> 04:35:45,620
Go back.

5182
04:35:46,820 --> 04:35:47,540
Go back.

5183
04:35:47,720 --> 04:35:48,020
Yeah.

5184
04:35:49,440 --> 04:35:50,280
Oh my god.

5185
04:35:50,300 --> 04:35:50,720
There's another guy.

5186
04:35:51,140 --> 04:35:51,580
Oh my god.

5187
04:35:52,720 --> 04:35:54,140
Motion detector lied to me.

5188
04:36:01,130 --> 04:36:01,570
Please.

5189
04:36:02,250 --> 04:36:02,690
Please.

5190
04:36:03,750 --> 04:36:04,190
Please.

5191
04:36:06,890 --> 04:36:07,330
Woo!

5192
04:36:07,550 --> 04:36:08,250
That was close.

5193
04:36:09,830 --> 04:36:11,670
That was so close.

5194
04:36:12,150 --> 04:36:12,590
Baby.

5195
04:36:20,040 --> 04:36:20,480
Honk.

5196
04:36:20,480 --> 04:36:21,160
Me, me, me, me, me.

5197
04:36:21,160 --> 04:36:22,320
Everybody honk me, me, me.

5198
04:36:27,020 --> 04:36:28,140
I'll take that.

5199
04:36:28,500 --> 04:36:28,900
Absolutely.

5200
04:36:31,900 --> 04:36:32,860
I'll wait for you.

5201
04:36:35,740 --> 04:36:36,860
Thank you, Metal Gear.

5202
04:36:37,220 --> 04:36:38,800
Thank you, Super-chan.

5203
04:36:38,940 --> 04:36:39,060
Thank you.

5204
04:36:41,220 --> 04:36:45,040
I love how the spotlight doesn't even like notice him.

5205
04:36:45,660 --> 04:36:46,600
Where's the door again?

5206
04:36:46,700 --> 04:36:47,580
Oh, there's that guy over there.

5207
04:36:50,080 --> 04:36:51,580
Is that the door I need to go into?

5208
04:36:52,260 --> 04:36:52,960
Where's it over here?

5209
04:36:53,060 --> 04:36:53,400
I can't remember.

5210
04:36:55,360 --> 04:36:56,280
I remember it...

5211
04:36:56,280 --> 04:36:57,000
Oh, there it is.

5212
04:36:57,020 --> 04:36:57,340
There it is.

5213
04:36:57,460 --> 04:36:57,620
Okay.

5214
04:37:06,130 --> 04:37:06,810
Actually, there's...

5215
04:37:07,390 --> 04:37:08,090
Uh, sorry.

5216
04:37:08,210 --> 04:37:08,830
I'm gonna use thermal.

5217
04:37:10,350 --> 04:37:10,690
Okay.

5218
04:37:10,790 --> 04:37:11,490
Just this guy.

5219
04:37:18,630 --> 04:37:18,970
Eesha!

5220
04:37:22,530 --> 04:37:23,210
Anyone else?

5221
04:37:23,210 --> 04:37:23,250
Anyone else?

5222
04:37:25,410 --> 04:37:26,870
Oh, I almost missed this.

5223
04:37:28,250 --> 04:37:28,770
Nice.

5224
04:37:33,070 --> 04:37:34,610
You hear an alarm.

5225
04:37:34,810 --> 04:37:35,430
It's like a ring.

5226
04:37:40,670 --> 04:37:41,510
It's a ring.

5227
04:37:49,130 --> 04:37:51,410
The spotlight guy isn't paying enough, right?

5228
04:37:51,890 --> 04:37:54,870
He's like, I honestly couldn't care less.

5229
04:37:58,030 --> 04:37:58,870
East wing!

5230
04:37:59,550 --> 04:38:00,930
La la la la la.

5231
04:38:00,930 --> 04:38:01,650
La la la la la.

5232
04:38:07,990 --> 04:38:13,670
From here, we must find Rykov, my beloved.

5233
04:38:22,820 --> 04:38:24,800
Our olive drab.

5234
04:38:25,920 --> 04:38:26,960
How drab.

5235
04:38:28,220 --> 04:38:30,180
The scientist this guy can work here?

5236
04:38:30,320 --> 04:38:31,720
Are you sure?

5237
04:38:33,280 --> 04:38:34,420
Are you sure?

5238
04:38:38,040 --> 04:38:38,520
Leandra!

5239
04:38:38,820 --> 04:38:39,520
Welcome to my bishop.

5240
04:38:39,600 --> 04:38:39,920
Thank you.

5241
04:38:40,800 --> 04:38:41,460
It does?

5242
04:38:41,880 --> 04:38:42,640
I don't remember.

5243
04:38:43,480 --> 04:38:44,600
Am I getting one guide?

5244
04:38:44,700 --> 04:38:45,100
Who knows?

5245
04:38:46,360 --> 04:38:49,680
What if Rykov just decide... Oh my god.

5246
04:38:49,900 --> 04:38:51,820
Look how handsome he is!

5247
04:38:53,700 --> 04:38:57,860
What if he just decided to cosplay as a scientist for today, you know?

5248
04:38:59,480 --> 04:39:00,520
Oh my god.

5249
04:39:00,560 --> 04:39:02,300
Look how handsome he is with the glasses!

5250
04:39:05,880 --> 04:39:08,520
I need riding in glasses stat.

5251
04:39:17,310 --> 04:39:18,630
I guess we'll test it.

5252
04:39:25,420 --> 04:39:26,640
I'm just a scientist.

5253
04:39:27,560 --> 04:39:28,840
Pay no mind to me.

5254
04:39:29,380 --> 04:39:30,560
I'm just a scientist.

5255
04:39:32,440 --> 04:39:34,520
Just a lowly scientist.

5256
04:39:36,400 --> 04:39:38,280
Looking for my master.

5257
04:39:39,620 --> 04:39:41,080
What do you mean?

5258
04:39:41,120 --> 04:39:43,560
What do you mean by that?

5259
04:39:45,540 --> 04:39:46,660
That's where I gotta put him.

5260
04:39:46,740 --> 04:39:47,340
In the lockers.

5261
04:39:51,900 --> 04:39:52,600
Don't go in there.

5262
04:39:53,280 --> 04:39:53,600
Oh!

5263
04:39:54,400 --> 04:39:55,140
I found him!

5264
04:39:59,780 --> 04:40:00,100
Wait.

5265
04:40:00,100 --> 04:40:00,600
Hold on.

5266
04:40:01,460 --> 04:40:02,020
One second.

5267
04:40:15,230 --> 04:40:15,550
Nothing?

5268
04:40:15,810 --> 04:40:16,330
Oh my god.

5269
04:40:16,370 --> 04:40:16,670
No way.

5270
04:40:18,430 --> 04:40:18,970
No, no, no.

5271
04:40:19,550 --> 04:40:20,270
Let's go grab him.

5272
04:40:20,710 --> 04:40:21,210
Come on.

5273
04:40:21,510 --> 04:40:22,110
We gotta go.

5274
04:40:22,270 --> 04:40:22,850
We gotta go.

5275
04:40:24,990 --> 04:40:25,390
We gotta go.

5276
04:40:25,470 --> 04:40:25,790
We gotta go.

5277
04:40:26,990 --> 04:40:27,850
Oh my god.

5278
04:40:27,870 --> 04:40:28,450
Oh my god.

5279
04:40:28,490 --> 04:40:28,730
Oh my god.

5280
04:40:28,950 --> 04:40:29,310
Oh my god.

5281
04:40:29,750 --> 04:40:30,570
Oh my god.

5282
04:40:30,890 --> 04:40:30,990
Oh my god.

5283
04:40:31,070 --> 04:40:31,470
Oh my god.

5284
04:40:32,310 --> 04:40:33,030
Oh wait.

5285
04:40:33,210 --> 04:40:34,070
Someone just opened a door?

5286
04:40:35,190 --> 04:40:35,910
We're okay.

5287
04:40:39,230 --> 04:40:40,150
No one will notice.

5288
04:40:40,750 --> 04:40:42,290
If they notice, well...

5289
04:40:45,030 --> 04:40:45,750
Just redo.

5290
04:40:58,230 --> 04:40:58,590
Yes!

5291
04:41:00,310 --> 04:41:00,990
Yes!

5292
04:41:00,990 --> 04:41:01,190
Yes!

5293
04:41:03,310 --> 04:41:03,990
Easy!

5294
04:41:07,070 --> 04:41:09,510
That was so easy!

5295
04:41:10,310 --> 04:41:10,350
That was so easy!

5296
04:41:10,350 --> 04:41:11,110
That was so easy!

5297
04:41:16,020 --> 04:41:17,640
Oh la la!

5298
04:41:18,180 --> 04:41:18,860
Rykov!

5299
04:41:19,060 --> 04:41:20,500
And your tiny whities!

5300
04:41:22,260 --> 04:41:23,860
Oh my god!

5301
04:41:24,200 --> 04:41:24,980
Oh my god!

5302
04:41:25,600 --> 04:41:27,600
Why is it gotta be a thong?

5303
04:41:27,660 --> 04:41:28,400
Oh my god.

5304
04:41:29,640 --> 04:41:31,140
Volgan, you dog!

5305
04:41:31,140 --> 04:41:31,960
You are...

5306
04:41:36,320 --> 04:41:38,520
Volgan, you are so nasty.

5307
04:41:41,760 --> 04:41:42,940
Oh my chat froze.

5308
04:41:43,200 --> 04:41:44,040
One second, guys.

5309
04:41:44,660 --> 04:41:46,620
I think YouTube is at it again.

5310
04:41:48,040 --> 04:41:50,260
YouTube's at it again with their silliness.

5311
04:41:57,410 --> 04:42:01,930
We are 100% foolproof, baby.

5312
04:42:02,650 --> 04:42:03,450
Are you okay?

5313
04:42:03,470 --> 04:42:03,810
Are you okay in there?

5314
04:42:04,530 --> 04:42:05,330
Oh my god.

5315
04:42:05,450 --> 04:42:05,770
Wait.

5316
04:42:05,950 --> 04:42:06,630
Put him back in.

5317
04:42:06,810 --> 04:42:07,130
Please.

5318
04:42:08,530 --> 04:42:09,610
Put him back in, please.

5319
04:42:14,000 --> 04:42:14,620
Put him back in.

5320
04:42:14,960 --> 04:42:16,020
Can you please do that?

5321
04:42:18,060 --> 04:42:19,520
I just wanted to see the poster.

5322
04:42:25,360 --> 04:42:25,900
Oh, wait.

5323
04:42:25,980 --> 04:42:26,300
Hold on.

5324
04:42:26,320 --> 04:42:27,240
Let me fix my chat real quick.

5325
04:42:27,520 --> 04:42:28,020
Sorry guys.

5326
04:42:28,080 --> 04:42:28,720
I can't see you guys.

5327
04:42:28,800 --> 04:42:29,420
It's all frozen.

5328
04:42:31,540 --> 04:42:32,180
I refresh.

5329
04:42:32,700 --> 04:42:33,160
I refresh.

5330
04:42:33,160 --> 04:42:33,240
I refresh.

5331
04:42:33,360 --> 04:42:33,560
I refresh.

5332
04:42:34,220 --> 04:42:34,700
Oh.

5333
04:42:38,840 --> 04:42:40,460
YouTube is like really...

5334
04:42:40,460 --> 04:42:42,660
Why has YouTube been so weird for me lately?

5335
04:42:45,800 --> 04:42:47,720
Like it's not loading at all or anything.

5336
04:42:49,700 --> 04:42:51,400
I don't know why it's been so weird.

5337
04:42:52,000 --> 04:42:54,860
Ah, your Rykov disguise has turned out nicely.

5338
04:42:55,240 --> 04:42:55,700
Thanks.

5339
04:42:56,640 --> 04:42:57,120
Yeah.

5340
04:42:57,120 --> 04:42:59,280
Not even his own mother could tell the difference.

5341
04:43:00,380 --> 04:43:00,860
Indeed.

5342
04:43:00,960 --> 04:43:02,700
You're starting to irritate me already.

5343
04:43:03,000 --> 04:43:03,300
Why?

5344
04:43:05,840 --> 04:43:07,820
I wouldn't bet on it, but whatever.

5345
04:43:09,100 --> 04:43:16,100
Now that you're indistinguishable from the real Rykov, you'll be able to get into the west wing, to which only Volgin and Rykov have access.

5346
04:43:17,520 --> 04:43:19,700
Head for the west wing of the weapons lab.

5347
04:43:19,860 --> 04:43:21,480
That's where Sokolov is being held.

5348
04:43:22,020 --> 04:43:22,840
West wing.

5349
04:43:23,000 --> 04:43:25,360
Enter the main wing from the second floor of the east wing.

5350
04:43:25,900 --> 04:43:29,620
Pass west through the main wing and you'll come to a connecting passageway.

5351
04:43:29,960 --> 04:43:32,040
The west wing is at the other end of that passageway.

5352
04:43:32,040 --> 04:43:33,300
Have you been glitching this entire stream?

5353
04:43:33,440 --> 04:43:33,760
No way.

5354
04:43:33,780 --> 04:43:33,780
I'm so sorry.

5355
04:43:33,780 --> 04:43:35,900
Infiltrate the west wing and rescue Sokolov.

5356
04:43:36,020 --> 04:43:36,320
Okay.

5357
04:43:37,440 --> 04:43:43,400
Reacting to a female character wearing a thong with a lightning bolt on it.

5358
04:43:43,500 --> 04:43:44,620
They are commenting on the...

5359
04:43:44,620 --> 04:43:45,220
No!

5360
04:43:45,380 --> 04:43:45,980
It went away!

5361
04:43:46,260 --> 04:43:52,640
They are commenting on the unusual fashion choice and some are joking about the character's sexuality.

5362
04:43:59,640 --> 04:44:00,120
Okay.

5363
04:44:01,600 --> 04:44:03,040
Let's run around, baby.

5364
04:44:03,040 --> 04:44:04,460
Get out!

5365
04:44:04,540 --> 04:44:04,660
Get out!

5366
04:44:04,740 --> 04:44:05,220
Get out!

5367
04:44:05,300 --> 04:44:05,880
Get out!

5368
04:44:06,400 --> 04:44:06,980
Alright.

5369
04:44:08,580 --> 04:44:09,940
Let's beat up some people.

5370
04:44:10,660 --> 04:44:12,540
Finally, I can take out my anger.

5371
04:44:12,960 --> 04:44:15,000
I can finally take out my anger.

5372
04:44:17,140 --> 04:44:18,000
Where are you?

5373
04:44:18,620 --> 04:44:19,600
In the bathroom?

5374
04:44:20,720 --> 04:44:21,620
Who's peeing?

5375
04:44:21,840 --> 04:44:23,060
Anybody pooping?

5376
04:44:23,100 --> 04:44:23,780
No one?

5377
04:44:23,940 --> 04:44:24,520
Anybody?

5378
04:44:29,280 --> 04:44:29,860
Yeah.

5379
04:44:30,640 --> 04:44:31,420
You're welcome.

5380
04:44:35,280 --> 04:44:37,020
Keep up the fine work, sir.

5381
04:44:40,640 --> 04:44:41,700
Smack you!

5382
04:44:44,520 --> 04:44:45,080
What?

5383
04:44:45,160 --> 04:44:45,980
Why do you act like that?

5384
04:44:47,180 --> 04:44:48,300
A scorpion!

5385
04:44:48,340 --> 04:44:48,960
Submachine gun.

5386
04:44:49,120 --> 04:44:49,460
Let's go.

5387
04:44:53,560 --> 04:44:54,120
Oh.

5388
04:44:54,140 --> 04:44:54,520
No.

5389
04:44:54,640 --> 04:44:55,720
There we go.

5390
04:44:57,100 --> 04:44:58,220
My bullet...

5391
04:44:58,220 --> 04:44:59,020
More stuff.

5392
04:45:00,600 --> 04:45:04,000
Is your commander jumping on things again?

5393
04:45:04,940 --> 04:45:05,760
Of course.

5394
04:45:06,680 --> 04:45:08,500
Doing my parkour.

5395
04:45:10,260 --> 04:45:11,300
Oh, nice!

5396
04:45:11,580 --> 04:45:13,260
Oh, nice!

5397
04:45:16,720 --> 04:45:18,660
He never just slaps once.

5398
04:45:18,960 --> 04:45:19,900
He never just slaps once.

5399
04:45:19,900 --> 04:45:21,160
Just don't bring up Texas!

5400
04:45:22,100 --> 04:45:22,680
Just don't bring up Texas!

5401
04:45:24,900 --> 04:45:27,140
Yeah, don't bring up Texas, you guys.

5402
04:45:27,400 --> 04:45:27,880
Yeah,

5403
04:45:30,920 --> 04:45:30,920
don't bring up Texas, you guys.

5404
04:45:30,920 --> 04:45:32,200
I hear them walking around.

5405
04:45:32,640 --> 04:45:35,700
Do they hear me or are they just like, He's really going crazy in there.

5406
04:45:36,360 --> 04:45:38,060
What if I blew this place up?

5407
04:45:40,040 --> 04:45:41,740
What if I blew this place up?

5408
04:45:44,080 --> 04:45:44,560
Yeah.

5409
04:45:45,220 --> 04:45:45,840
Yeah, yeah.

5410
04:45:47,400 --> 04:45:48,340
What's going on?

5411
04:45:49,900 --> 04:45:51,240
What do you mean, what's going on?

5412
04:45:52,080 --> 04:45:53,500
Forgive me for troubling you, sir.

5413
04:45:53,580 --> 04:45:54,200
Yeah, yeah.

5414
04:45:54,280 --> 04:45:55,580
You should be sorry.

5415
04:45:55,840 --> 04:45:56,720
Did I go in here already?

5416
04:45:59,960 --> 04:46:01,020
What's going on?

5417
04:46:01,200 --> 04:46:01,900
Just me?

5418
04:46:02,640 --> 04:46:03,720
Your commander?

5419
04:46:05,540 --> 04:46:06,500
Lord Supreme?

5420
04:46:06,860 --> 04:46:07,140
What?

5421
04:46:07,620 --> 04:46:08,100
Sir.

5422
04:46:08,200 --> 04:46:08,480
Yeah.

5423
04:46:09,700 --> 04:46:10,480
Salute me.

5424
04:46:10,600 --> 04:46:12,700
I want to see you hold that position.

5425
04:46:13,000 --> 04:46:14,360
Hold that position!

5426
04:46:15,080 --> 04:46:15,640
Sir.

5427
04:46:15,900 --> 04:46:17,740
Until I tell you to stop.

5428
04:46:22,100 --> 04:46:23,160
And if you're wondering...

5429
04:46:23,160 --> 04:46:24,020
Yeah, I do know where to go.

5430
04:46:24,180 --> 04:46:24,900
I'm just...

5431
04:46:26,400 --> 04:46:27,600
Running around everywhere.

5432
04:46:28,840 --> 04:46:31,320
Running around at the speed of sound.

5433
04:46:31,780 --> 04:46:31,800
Running around at the speed of sound.

5434
04:46:32,640 --> 04:46:33,200
Sir.

5435
04:46:33,900 --> 04:46:34,460
Sir.

5436
04:46:34,740 --> 04:46:35,200
Sir.

5437
04:46:38,600 --> 04:46:40,180
Thanks for that, boss.

5438
04:46:40,420 --> 04:46:40,980
Thanks for that, boss.

5439
04:46:42,020 --> 04:46:42,400
Classic.

5440
04:46:42,860 --> 04:46:44,320
Oh, the little scientist.

5441
04:46:45,600 --> 04:46:46,660
You little scientist.

5442
04:46:46,860 --> 04:46:48,400
You little bitch ass scientist.

5443
04:46:49,560 --> 04:46:49,940
Yeah.

5444
04:46:49,940 --> 04:46:50,320
Coward.

5445
04:46:50,960 --> 04:46:51,340
Coward.

5446
04:46:51,400 --> 04:46:51,820
What was that?

5447
04:46:52,620 --> 04:46:53,580
What, did you want to say anything?

5448
04:46:53,680 --> 04:46:53,800
No?

5449
04:46:54,820 --> 04:46:55,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5450
04:46:55,740 --> 04:46:56,220
Shake your head.

5451
04:46:56,420 --> 04:46:57,920
You didn't want to say... Yeah, you're quiet.

5452
04:46:58,500 --> 04:46:59,280
What about you?

5453
04:47:00,160 --> 04:47:00,540
Yeah?

5454
04:47:01,320 --> 04:47:01,700
Salute.

5455
04:47:04,040 --> 04:47:04,640
Salute me!

5456
04:47:05,520 --> 04:47:06,540
What's wrong with you?

5457
04:47:07,320 --> 04:47:08,600
God, where are your manners?

5458
04:47:09,200 --> 04:47:13,200
Why don't we hire any good scientists nowadays with good manners?

5459
04:47:13,360 --> 04:47:13,600
Why don't we hire any good scientists nowadays with good manners?

5460
04:47:13,600 --> 04:47:15,060
Who's sleeping over here on the job?

5461
04:47:17,140 --> 04:47:17,680
Who's sleeping over here on the job?

5462
04:47:17,680 --> 04:47:18,240
Wake up!

5463
04:47:24,990 --> 04:47:27,210
Every scientist needs to get kicked.

5464
04:47:27,430 --> 04:47:27,490
Every scientist needs to get kicked.

5465
04:47:27,490 --> 04:47:29,770
All you need to get whipped back into shape.

5466
04:47:29,990 --> 04:47:32,850
Keep working on our Metal Gear.

5467
04:47:33,310 --> 04:47:34,350
Keep working on our Metal Gear.

5468
04:47:34,350 --> 04:47:34,850
Keep working on it.

5469
04:47:41,600 --> 04:47:43,080
I think I did a good job.

5470
04:47:46,240 --> 04:47:47,740
Let's go out through its door.

5471
04:47:47,880 --> 04:47:48,940
Let's go explore the base.

5472
04:47:49,040 --> 04:47:50,220
A little bit more.

5473
04:47:51,960 --> 04:47:53,020
Actually, nah, it's okay.

5474
04:47:53,140 --> 04:47:54,380
I think I have a lot of...

5475
04:47:54,380 --> 04:47:56,160
I have more bullets and everything.

5476
04:47:56,320 --> 04:47:56,960
I think I'm okay for now.

5477
04:47:57,600 --> 04:48:01,020
I was going to say I need to explore, but that's just me being a loot goblin.

5478
04:48:01,240 --> 04:48:06,780
I've been trying to get so many things and it always tells me I'm full on ammo and everything, so I think we're okay.

5479
04:48:08,340 --> 04:48:09,300
Don't open that one.

5480
04:48:21,210 --> 04:48:22,290
Silent Hill Nurse.

5481
04:48:22,790 --> 04:48:22,950
Silent Hill Nurse.

5482
04:48:24,630 --> 04:48:25,590
Oh yeah, sorry.

5483
04:48:25,710 --> 04:48:26,450
It's the Shackle Holler.

5484
04:48:28,090 --> 04:48:28,930
Snake, I...

5485
04:48:28,930 --> 04:48:31,950
Hello there?

5486
04:48:32,830 --> 04:48:33,870
Paramedic, it's me.

5487
04:48:35,190 --> 04:48:35,630
Snake?

5488
04:48:35,630 --> 04:48:36,770
Oh, it's you.

5489
04:48:37,050 --> 04:48:38,930
For a minute there, I thought you were someone else.

5490
04:48:39,410 --> 04:48:40,670
Why are you so nervous?

5491
04:48:41,130 --> 04:48:42,890
You've seen this mask before, right?

5492
04:48:43,510 --> 04:48:45,050
Yeah, but it looks...

5493
04:48:45,050 --> 04:48:45,830
so cool.

5494
04:48:46,870 --> 04:48:47,650
So cool?

5495
04:48:47,810 --> 04:48:48,090
Cool.

5496
04:48:48,490 --> 04:48:50,670
You know, kind of like a Venusian.

5497
04:48:51,410 --> 04:48:52,290
A Venusian?

5498
04:48:52,950 --> 04:48:54,750
I mean, not the crab kind.

5499
04:48:54,890 --> 04:48:55,390
The other kind.

5500
04:48:55,690 --> 04:48:55,810
What?

5501
04:48:56,130 --> 04:49:01,210
Paramedic, do you really think a guy you've never seen before would suddenly call you on this frequency?

5502
04:49:01,570 --> 04:49:04,110
I know it sounds ridiculous, but still.

5503
04:49:05,310 --> 04:49:07,450
What if it was a being from another planet?

5504
04:49:07,670 --> 04:49:09,570
You can't rule out that possibility.

5505
04:49:13,940 --> 04:49:15,400
He looks so cool.

5506
04:49:16,600 --> 04:49:18,800
He should be the protag of his own game.

5507
04:49:19,100 --> 04:49:20,000
She's the Lulu.

5508
04:49:20,200 --> 04:49:20,640
So true.

5509
04:49:22,200 --> 04:49:24,400
Okay, you're disguised as Rikar.

5510
04:49:24,600 --> 04:49:24,800
Yep.

5511
04:49:25,020 --> 04:49:28,000
You ought to be able to pass for the real deal in that outfit.

5512
04:49:28,240 --> 04:49:28,680
Yep.

5513
04:49:28,740 --> 04:49:31,660
You can go anywhere you want, and nobody's going to ask questions.

5514
04:49:31,720 --> 04:49:32,120
Yep.

5515
04:49:32,540 --> 04:49:35,860
But don't forget that you can't equip most of your weapons when you're in disguise.

5516
04:49:36,100 --> 04:49:36,440
Yep.

5517
04:49:37,500 --> 04:49:38,220
So sad.

5518
04:49:40,860 --> 04:49:42,520
My Rikar of disguise.

5519
04:49:45,200 --> 04:49:46,640
Let's go get some love.

5520
04:49:48,740 --> 04:49:49,180
Ooh.

5521
04:49:50,040 --> 04:49:50,560
Ooh.

5522
04:49:52,500 --> 04:49:53,020
Oh,

5523
04:50:01,160 --> 04:50:01,740
Eva Kodak?

5524
04:50:02,060 --> 04:50:03,620
You think she'll be so scared of me?

5525
04:50:05,420 --> 04:50:05,940
Okay.

5526
04:50:06,320 --> 04:50:08,360
Your Rikar of disguise is complete.

5527
04:50:08,620 --> 04:50:11,100
Now they won't stop you no matter what you do.

5528
04:50:12,260 --> 04:50:14,220
Even if I punch someone in the face?

5529
04:50:14,440 --> 04:50:14,680
Yeah.

5530
04:50:15,300 --> 04:50:15,820
Really?

5531
04:50:16,100 --> 04:50:16,580
Really.

5532
04:50:17,140 --> 04:50:17,660
Why?

5533
04:50:18,480 --> 04:50:19,940
Rikar's just that kind of guy.

5534
04:50:20,040 --> 04:50:21,120
Rikar's such a freak!

5535
04:50:23,340 --> 04:50:28,420
Once you're disguised as Rikar, you can get into the west wing where Sokolov is being held.

5536
04:50:28,520 --> 04:50:28,740
Yeah.

5537
04:50:29,040 --> 04:50:36,580
To get to the entrance to the west wing, pass west through the main wing of the weapons lab and go through the connecting passageway.

5538
04:50:36,680 --> 04:50:36,840
Yeah.

5539
04:50:36,840 --> 04:50:36,840
Okay.

5540
04:50:38,440 --> 04:50:43,320
You can get into the main wing of the weapons lab from the southwest side of the second floor.

5541
04:50:43,320 --> 04:50:44,020
Southwest side of the second floor.

5542
04:50:44,020 --> 04:50:44,860
Head for the main wing.

5543
04:50:45,080 --> 04:50:45,500
Okay.

5544
04:50:46,340 --> 04:50:46,820
Alright.

5545
04:50:47,320 --> 04:50:51,900
We just, again, we just don't need anybody grabbing our crotch.

5546
04:50:54,360 --> 04:50:55,980
I wonder what the difference is.

5547
04:51:00,320 --> 04:51:01,520
I wonder.

5548
04:51:04,780 --> 04:51:06,260
Oh, oh, oopsie.

5549
04:51:09,340 --> 04:51:10,460
Who would do that?

5550
04:51:10,640 --> 04:51:10,940
Nobody.

5551
04:51:11,740 --> 04:51:12,860
Nobody would do that.

5552
04:51:13,180 --> 04:51:14,780
Otherwise it's a perfect disguise.

5553
04:51:15,320 --> 04:51:15,720
Okay.

5554
04:51:17,020 --> 04:51:17,820
There we go.

5555
04:51:20,180 --> 04:51:22,340
I need to see the models.

5556
04:51:23,740 --> 04:51:24,520
You know?

5557
04:51:25,260 --> 04:51:26,400
The character models.

5558
04:51:26,780 --> 04:51:27,260
Alright.

5559
04:51:31,660 --> 04:51:32,740
There it is!

5560
04:51:33,060 --> 04:51:34,440
The shagohide!

5561
04:51:35,380 --> 04:51:36,980
Oh my gosh.

5562
04:51:37,140 --> 04:51:38,040
There it is.

5563
04:51:38,080 --> 04:51:38,580
There it is.

5564
04:51:40,760 --> 04:51:41,240
I

5565
04:51:45,870 --> 04:51:46,670
wanna go in.

5566
04:51:47,070 --> 04:51:48,150
I wanna go in.

5567
04:51:49,430 --> 04:51:50,850
There's the shagohide.

5568
04:51:55,100 --> 04:51:56,620
OG camera here is cool too.

5569
04:51:56,760 --> 04:51:57,400
Oh, let me try it.

5570
04:51:58,080 --> 04:51:58,560
Sorry.

5571
04:51:58,660 --> 04:52:00,920
We gotta go back for the cinema.

5572
04:52:02,060 --> 04:52:03,360
For the cinematics!

5573
04:52:04,660 --> 04:52:05,140
Okay.

5574
04:52:07,600 --> 04:52:08,080
Oh.

5575
04:52:08,280 --> 04:52:10,900
It looks exactly like how I got it.

5576
04:52:13,200 --> 04:52:15,200
I like how I see it's no Rex.

5577
04:52:16,280 --> 04:52:17,560
I see it's no Ray.

5578
04:52:18,440 --> 04:52:20,140
Actually, the shagohide is pretty ugly.

5579
04:52:20,620 --> 04:52:21,660
I'm not gonna lie.

5580
04:52:24,000 --> 04:52:24,980
But you know, whatever.

5581
04:52:26,120 --> 04:52:26,600
Whatever.

5582
04:52:28,220 --> 04:52:28,920
It's fine.

5583
04:52:29,360 --> 04:52:30,560
It's not a Metal Gear.

5584
04:52:30,940 --> 04:52:34,560
So, you know, it's not like we can be like, oh, it's so cute!

5585
04:52:35,000 --> 04:52:36,840
All the other Metal Gears are truly cute.

5586
04:52:37,840 --> 04:52:38,260
Hello.

5587
04:52:41,100 --> 04:52:42,380
But shagohide's kinda ugly.

5588
04:52:47,590 --> 04:52:49,530
What if I took off my mask in front of them?

5589
04:52:50,690 --> 04:52:51,110
Salute!

5590
04:52:51,910 --> 04:52:52,330
Yes.

5591
04:52:54,350 --> 04:52:57,950
Does Rykov, like, kind of sneak around hunched like that?

5592
04:53:01,570 --> 04:53:02,050
Alrighty.

5593
04:53:05,630 --> 04:53:07,650
Why are you taking it off, though?

5594
04:53:14,920 --> 04:53:17,280
I just like wearing a thong to get into character.

5595
04:53:19,720 --> 04:53:22,680
Maybe that's what Volgan feels.

5596
04:53:23,300 --> 04:53:24,780
That he's not wearing his thong.

5597
04:53:26,540 --> 04:53:27,260
What is that?

5598
04:53:30,940 --> 04:53:32,660
What about the Philosopher's Legacy?

5599
04:53:33,640 --> 04:53:35,680
I don't know anything about that.

5600
04:53:39,360 --> 04:53:40,380
What are you...

5601
04:53:40,380 --> 04:53:42,740
Are you trying to kill me?

5602
04:53:42,740 --> 04:53:43,840
Don't be a little liar.

5603
04:53:44,060 --> 04:53:44,780
What's the matter?

5604
04:53:46,460 --> 04:53:47,640
Afraid of some lipstick?

5605
04:53:48,420 --> 04:53:49,580
I know nothing.

5606
04:53:49,660 --> 04:53:50,360
I swear it.

5607
04:53:51,240 --> 04:53:53,220
No one but the Colonel knows of the Legacy.

5608
04:53:54,300 --> 04:53:55,140
I see.

5609
04:53:55,940 --> 04:53:57,020
No, don't!

5610
04:53:59,640 --> 04:54:00,720
Come on.

5611
04:54:00,740 --> 04:54:02,020
It's just a little bit of lipstick.

5612
04:54:02,800 --> 04:54:04,120
You gotta be more secure in yourself.

5613
04:54:04,820 --> 04:54:05,960
It's just some lipstick.

5614
04:54:09,440 --> 04:54:12,480
I'm eating my potato chip sticks, by the way.

5615
04:54:14,480 --> 04:54:15,840
Yeah, I was really not his color.

5616
04:54:15,920 --> 04:54:16,380
You're so right.

5617
04:54:33,860 --> 04:54:34,420
Who's there?

5618
04:54:36,180 --> 04:54:36,600
Ugh.

5619
04:54:36,860 --> 04:54:38,360
You're the man from the CIA.

5620
04:54:38,980 --> 04:54:40,120
I got a crumb in my throat.

5621
04:54:40,640 --> 04:54:41,720
What are you doing here?

5622
04:54:42,500 --> 04:54:44,220
I told you before, didn't I?

5623
04:54:44,540 --> 04:54:45,920
I'm going to get you out of here.

5624
04:54:47,900 --> 04:54:50,300
A man of honor, just like your commander.

5625
04:54:50,320 --> 04:54:51,440
After this, I'll get some water.

5626
04:54:52,260 --> 04:54:54,140
But I'm afraid you're too late.

5627
04:54:54,380 --> 04:54:54,800
What?

5628
04:54:54,800 --> 04:54:55,520
Too late?

5629
04:54:55,920 --> 04:54:58,440
Oh my god, Snake looks so good in this uniform.

5630
04:54:59,160 --> 04:55:00,320
You know what he looks like?

5631
04:55:00,360 --> 04:55:02,520
He looks like that commander guy from Nikkei.

5632
04:55:04,800 --> 04:55:07,320
In this outfit, he looks like the guy from Nikkei.

5633
04:55:07,420 --> 04:55:08,500
In this outfit, he looks like the guy from Nikkei.

5634
04:55:08,500 --> 04:55:09,520
I don't remember his name, though.

5635
04:55:10,360 --> 04:55:16,020
To put it in technical terms, it's a composite range extension system for medium range ballistic missiles.

5636
04:55:16,040 --> 04:55:16,380
Anderson?

5637
04:55:16,500 --> 04:55:16,920
Maybe.

5638
04:55:23,420 --> 04:55:24,100
I don't remember his name.

5639
04:55:24,100 --> 04:55:30,880
The Shagahod was originally designed as a tank that could launch nuclear missiles from any type of terrain.

5640
04:55:31,060 --> 04:55:32,560
I saw a cosplayer of him at TGS even.

5641
04:55:32,560 --> 04:55:36,240
There was just one problem we couldn't figure out how to solve.

5642
04:55:36,480 --> 04:55:42,760
The ICBMs we have today are simply too big for the Shagahod to carry.

5643
04:55:43,580 --> 04:55:46,380
But the military would not hear of it.

5644
04:55:46,380 --> 04:55:51,540
They demanded a weapon that could launch a nuclear missile directly into the American homeland.

5645
04:55:51,540 --> 04:55:52,620
And he looks like a slug.

5646
04:55:53,560 --> 04:55:57,440
That is when I came up with the idea for Phase 2.

5647
04:55:58,120 --> 04:56:01,620
But there's no way you could load an ICBM onto the Shagahod.

5648
04:56:02,120 --> 04:56:03,480
So how do you do it?

5649
04:56:03,880 --> 04:56:06,360
By accelerating the Shagahod itself.

5650
04:56:07,860 --> 04:56:08,640
Accelerating it?

5651
04:56:09,140 --> 04:56:14,860
In Phase 2, a rocket booster unit is attached to the frame of the Shagahod.

5652
04:56:15,620 --> 04:56:21,040
The unit incorporates the same technology used in the Vostok rocket that sent Major Gagarin into space.

5653
04:56:22,020 --> 04:56:22,860
Look at him go!

5654
04:56:23,120 --> 04:56:29,760
Using this booster, the Shagahod can achieve a land speed of over 300 miles per hour.

5655
04:56:29,840 --> 04:56:30,940
But you need like so much.

5656
04:56:30,940 --> 04:56:33,480
That monster can go more than 300 miles per hour.

5657
04:56:33,560 --> 04:56:35,160
You need so much space for this.

5658
04:56:35,160 --> 04:56:35,800
It's not practical.

5659
04:56:36,080 --> 04:56:39,100
And from this state of accelerated motion, it launches a nuclear missile.

5660
04:56:40,160 --> 04:56:42,060
Who straps a rocket to a tank?

5661
04:56:43,660 --> 04:56:45,580
It acts like the first stage of a rocket.

5662
04:56:46,020 --> 04:56:47,160
Yes, precisely.

5663
04:56:48,080 --> 04:56:55,620
The range of the missile launched by the Shagahod thus increases from 2,500 miles to 6,000 miles.

5664
04:56:55,820 --> 04:56:57,180
6,000 miles.

5665
04:56:57,540 --> 04:57:01,340
That's enough to strike anywhere in the United States.

5666
04:57:01,440 --> 04:57:02,240
What the hell is your profile picture?

5667
04:57:02,240 --> 04:57:09,660
Not only that, with the Shagahod, there's no need to construct giant silos like the ones used to house ICBMs.

5668
04:57:10,520 --> 04:57:10,720
Oh.

5669
04:57:11,180 --> 04:57:15,540
All you need is a runway 3 miles in length or its equivalent.

5670
04:57:15,700 --> 04:57:17,520
All you need is about 3 miles.

5671
04:57:17,520 --> 04:57:22,480
And you can launch a thermal nuclear strike against any location in the United States from anywhere in the Soviet Union.

5672
04:57:23,060 --> 04:57:26,140
It cannot be detected by spy planes or satellites.

5673
04:57:26,180 --> 04:57:27,020
Okay, that's pretty bad.

5674
04:57:27,160 --> 04:57:31,820
It's a mobile fortress capable of deploying in secret and launching its payload at any time.

5675
04:57:31,920 --> 04:57:32,960
Yeah, that sucks.

5676
04:57:33,180 --> 04:57:33,720
It's not good.

5677
04:57:37,700 --> 04:57:38,960
That's so like...

5678
04:57:38,960 --> 04:57:39,540
I don't know.

5679
04:57:39,700 --> 04:57:41,180
It just doesn't seem so...

5680
04:57:41,940 --> 04:57:42,840
Why did they...

5681
04:57:43,660 --> 04:57:46,940
Turn down Grannon's idea and think this was better.

5682
04:57:47,100 --> 04:57:47,800
I don't understand.

5683
04:57:48,640 --> 04:57:53,100
But Vulcan is planning to mass produce them based on that prototype.

5684
04:57:53,540 --> 04:57:55,720
And deploy them all over the Soviet Union.

5685
04:57:56,140 --> 04:57:56,700
Yes.

5686
04:57:57,400 --> 04:57:58,760
And that's not the end of it.

5687
04:57:59,440 --> 04:58:01,760
He's going to ship them to Eastern Europe.

5688
04:58:01,920 --> 04:58:02,580
To Asia.

5689
04:58:02,780 --> 04:58:04,900
To all the countries of the Eastern Bloc.

5690
04:58:04,980 --> 04:58:14,440
Even worse, he intends to use the Shagahod as bait to format armed uprisings among dictators, ethnic insurgents and revolutionary groups throughout the Third World.

5691
04:58:14,780 --> 04:58:17,840
We came for the cute ghost babies and the fence builders.

5692
04:58:17,860 --> 04:58:20,940
He could start mass production tomorrow if he wanted.

5693
04:58:22,040 --> 04:58:29,200
The reason that tensions between East and West have settled into a cold war is because each side fears the other's power.

5694
04:58:30,440 --> 04:58:31,040
Deterrence.

5695
04:58:31,640 --> 04:58:38,040
The idea of using threats to keep one's enemy in check is the perfect word to sum up this state of affairs.

5696
04:58:39,460 --> 04:58:40,020
But...

5697
04:58:40,020 --> 04:58:43,860
the Shagahod goes far beyond the level of threat.

5698
04:58:44,000 --> 04:58:46,020
A weapon to surpass ICBMs.

5699
04:58:46,080 --> 04:58:47,920
It will make the concept of deterrence utterly meaningless.

5700
04:58:48,400 --> 04:58:55,100
If such a weapon is unleashed on the world it will not be long before all nations are engulfed in conflict.

5701
04:58:56,080 --> 04:59:00,880
The Cold War will end and the entire planet will be consumed by the fires of war.

5702
04:59:01,720 --> 04:59:04,600
Vulcan and the Shagahod will be at the center of it all.

5703
04:59:04,660 --> 04:59:08,820
Probably because the tech for legs wasn't quite there yet in the Warhouse on Rockets.

5704
04:59:08,860 --> 04:59:09,540
That's true.

5705
04:59:09,800 --> 04:59:11,880
It takes them a really long time to get...

5706
04:59:11,880 --> 04:59:13,600
to make wrecks.

5707
04:59:13,760 --> 04:59:14,540
That is true.

5708
04:59:15,420 --> 04:59:15,900
No.

5709
04:59:16,600 --> 04:59:17,800
It's not too late.

5710
04:59:18,120 --> 04:59:19,000
What do you mean?

5711
04:59:20,300 --> 04:59:21,560
We've still got a chance.

5712
04:59:21,660 --> 04:59:25,660
All we have to do is destroy the prototype and the whole facility before they can mass produce it.

5713
04:59:26,620 --> 04:59:27,100
But...

5714
04:59:27,100 --> 04:59:30,200
Just tell me what I need to do to destroy this place.

5715
04:59:33,740 --> 04:59:34,220
Alright.

5716
04:59:35,800 --> 04:59:39,080
The liquid fuel used in the rocket engine is stored in a tank.

5717
04:59:39,220 --> 04:59:41,440
If you can blow it up somehow...

5718
04:59:44,040 --> 04:59:47,440
Some C3 ought to be enough to blow the entire hangar to smithereens.

5719
04:59:48,480 --> 04:59:48,920
C3.

5720
04:59:49,320 --> 04:59:50,200
Someone stole the C3.

5721
04:59:50,200 --> 04:59:51,660
You mean that cutting edge plastic explosive?

5722
04:59:52,700 --> 04:59:54,640
It could be molded into any shape.

5723
04:59:54,900 --> 04:59:56,500
The bomb of the future.

5724
04:59:56,700 --> 04:59:57,860
Where can I get it?

5725
04:59:58,040 --> 05:00:01,060
There was some in the armory here, but it's gone now.

5726
05:00:01,060 --> 05:00:03,240
It was stolen by a female spy.

5727
05:00:03,260 --> 05:00:04,520
It was here a minute ago.

5728
05:00:04,520 --> 05:00:05,360
The door is truly hot.

5729
05:00:06,820 --> 05:00:07,260
No.

5730
05:00:07,260 --> 05:00:08,300
That's not her name.

5731
05:00:08,460 --> 05:00:10,160
Her name is Tatyana.

5732
05:00:10,420 --> 05:00:10,860
Tatyana.

5733
05:00:11,280 --> 05:00:13,820
She made her way in here by becoming Volgin's lover.

5734
05:00:14,480 --> 05:00:15,320
Look at her.

5735
05:00:15,340 --> 05:00:16,920
I thought she was your lover.

5736
05:00:17,140 --> 05:00:17,580
Mine?

5737
05:00:19,240 --> 05:00:19,680
No.

5738
05:00:20,120 --> 05:00:22,160
She is Volgin's lover.

5739
05:00:23,400 --> 05:00:26,140
He's like, I don't want anything to do with her after touching Volgin.

5740
05:00:26,260 --> 05:00:26,760
This is my lover.

5741
05:00:27,100 --> 05:00:27,860
My lover.

5742
05:00:33,000 --> 05:00:33,940
Who are they?

5743
05:00:34,200 --> 05:00:35,040
My wife.

5744
05:00:36,780 --> 05:00:37,760
They're in America.

5745
05:00:37,980 --> 05:00:40,240
His wife is so scary looking.

5746
05:00:40,240 --> 05:00:40,840
Now I remember.

5747
05:00:41,120 --> 05:00:42,760
Your family is in the custody of the CIA.

5748
05:00:42,760 --> 05:00:44,940
She has like the largest forehead ever.

5749
05:00:46,720 --> 05:00:48,500
How long has Tatyana been here?

5750
05:00:48,760 --> 05:00:49,560
What a beautiful family.

5751
05:00:49,680 --> 05:00:50,880
Only a few weeks.

5752
05:00:51,160 --> 05:00:53,100
This freak of a wife.

5753
05:00:53,100 --> 05:00:54,920
I can't wait to see her in Delta.

5754
05:00:55,080 --> 05:00:55,920
I'm so excited.

5755
05:00:56,280 --> 05:00:57,680
She said that Khrushchev sent her.

5756
05:00:58,940 --> 05:01:00,400
What did you just give her?

5757
05:01:00,820 --> 05:01:04,080
All of the experimental data for the Shagohod.

5758
05:01:04,260 --> 05:01:10,040
Apparently even like Kojima was just like, Yo, it is essential that you destroy the Shagohod.

5759
05:01:10,060 --> 05:01:11,440
Yo, Shinkawa-sama.

5760
05:01:11,440 --> 05:01:13,680
Shinkawa-san is pretty scary.

5761
05:01:14,380 --> 05:01:16,120
You should probably fix her.

5762
05:01:16,260 --> 05:01:17,720
And he was just like, Yeah, so?

5763
05:01:18,220 --> 05:01:19,160
I'm not going.

5764
05:01:20,540 --> 05:01:22,500
My mission is to rescue you.

5765
05:01:23,460 --> 05:01:24,180
Leave me.

5766
05:01:24,820 --> 05:01:25,340
Sokolov.

5767
05:01:28,960 --> 05:01:30,540
Khrushchev has abandoned me.

5768
05:01:30,720 --> 05:01:32,380
Snake just screamed eternally.

5769
05:01:32,620 --> 05:01:34,000
I cannot return to my country.

5770
05:01:34,820 --> 05:01:37,300
I would most certainly be sent to the gulags.

5771
05:01:37,420 --> 05:01:38,800
I need to see what she looks like.

5772
05:01:38,800 --> 05:01:40,000
What about the U.S.?

5773
05:01:42,080 --> 05:01:43,820
Yes, I once thought of that.

5774
05:01:45,080 --> 05:01:46,700
My family is waiting for me there.

5775
05:01:46,960 --> 05:01:54,880
But, even if I fled to the United States, I would once again find myself creating weapons of mass murder.

5776
05:01:55,180 --> 05:01:55,300
I would once again find myself creating weapons of mass murder.

5777
05:01:55,300 --> 05:01:56,140
Can you imagine if they...

5778
05:01:56,140 --> 05:01:57,420
144.75!

5779
05:01:57,800 --> 05:01:58,960
In the end, it doesn't matter where I go.

5780
05:01:59,140 --> 05:02:04,460
Can you imagine if they had like a game based off of Sokolov's skin?

5781
05:02:04,620 --> 05:02:09,980
He also becomes a scientist developing Metal Gears.

5782
05:02:12,100 --> 05:02:13,200
Aww, Sokolov.

5783
05:02:13,200 --> 05:02:15,700
Every day I help create things that should never be used.

5784
05:02:15,860 --> 05:02:18,400
Things that should never have existed in the first place.

5785
05:02:18,760 --> 05:02:19,660
Every day.

5786
05:02:19,740 --> 05:02:20,580
Without sleep.

5787
05:02:23,020 --> 05:02:25,040
Without a word of praise from others.

5788
05:02:26,660 --> 05:02:29,060
And my creations do not even benefit mankind.

5789
05:02:30,200 --> 05:02:31,360
This poor guy.

5790
05:02:33,280 --> 05:02:35,960
They are merely the tools of politicians.

5791
05:02:39,320 --> 05:02:43,640
All I wanted to do was build space rockets.

5792
05:02:43,640 --> 05:02:44,780
This is so sad!

5793
05:02:45,320 --> 05:02:47,000
But it was not to be.

5794
05:02:47,780 --> 05:02:52,000
The space race between America and Russia became the prey of politicians.

5795
05:02:52,960 --> 05:02:56,600
The space race and the arms race are one and the same.

5796
05:02:58,060 --> 05:02:59,380
Missiles, rockets,

5797
05:03:08,880 --> 05:03:18,240
and the space race are one and the same.

5798
05:03:19,200 --> 05:03:22,320
The space race

5799
05:03:25,900 --> 05:03:29,580
is not the only place where you can create and create more things.

5800
05:03:30,280 --> 05:03:36,140
I think that these are the and trying create and create and create

5801
05:04:02,100 --> 05:04:09,120
and make Something... see these crevices... this fabric does not feel right.

5802
05:04:20,680 --> 05:04:22,440
Oh, Volgen.

5803
05:04:22,540 --> 05:04:23,600
Oh my god.

5804
05:04:25,200 --> 05:04:27,060
I come here looking for Tatiana.

5805
05:04:27,240 --> 05:04:28,360
And what should I find?

5806
05:04:29,440 --> 05:04:31,460
But a greasy freebooter.

5807
05:04:31,780 --> 05:04:33,200
I love these cutscenes.

5808
05:04:33,700 --> 05:04:34,200
Oh no!

5809
05:04:40,940 --> 05:04:41,800
Oh my god.

5810
05:04:41,900 --> 05:04:42,100
Oh my god.

5811
05:04:42,160 --> 05:04:42,380
Oh my god.

5812
05:04:42,400 --> 05:04:42,620
Oh my god.

5813
05:04:44,640 --> 05:04:45,000
Yes!

5814
05:04:45,000 --> 05:04:46,080
I think you see him.

5815
05:04:46,400 --> 05:04:46,960
Take it down.

5816
05:04:47,020 --> 05:04:47,360
Take it down.

5817
05:04:47,360 --> 05:04:47,720
Take it down.

5818
05:04:56,340 --> 05:04:56,740
That's why!

5819
05:04:59,900 --> 05:05:00,640
Paz, why?

5820
05:05:01,180 --> 05:05:03,360
Why couldn't you just watch from outside the door?

5821
05:05:04,260 --> 05:05:05,220
Absolute cinema.

5822
05:05:15,320 --> 05:05:17,180
I don't know what you're talking about.

5823
05:05:18,040 --> 05:05:20,820
Paz, I've never been a fairy in disguise.

5824
05:05:20,920 --> 05:05:21,760
What are you talking about?

5825
05:05:24,360 --> 05:05:25,840
Ew, he's a skinwalker.

5826
05:05:29,820 --> 05:05:29,900
I don't like this.

5827
05:05:37,300 --> 05:05:39,360
All the guys are dead on the ground.

5828
05:05:40,800 --> 05:05:42,200
All the guys are like...

5829
05:05:42,200 --> 05:05:43,940
I see why they call you the boss.

5830
05:05:44,240 --> 05:05:44,320
Yeah.

5831
05:05:45,260 --> 05:05:46,160
What was that?

5832
05:05:46,280 --> 05:05:47,240
Some kind of judo?

5833
05:05:47,980 --> 05:05:49,820
No, it's called CQC.

5834
05:05:49,840 --> 05:05:51,840
A basic form of close quarters combat.

5835
05:05:53,760 --> 05:05:55,380
He and I developed it together.

5836
05:05:56,300 --> 05:05:56,780
No.

5837
05:05:58,120 --> 05:05:58,600
Splendid.

5838
05:05:59,580 --> 05:06:00,060
Splendid.

5839
05:06:00,060 --> 05:06:01,660
I'll take it from here.

5840
05:06:01,660 --> 05:06:02,480
Oh, boy.

5841
05:06:03,640 --> 05:06:04,300
Oh, no.

5842
05:06:04,500 --> 05:06:05,540
Are you going to kill him?

5843
05:06:06,700 --> 05:06:07,140
No.

5844
05:06:07,560 --> 05:06:08,520
Of course.

5845
05:06:08,700 --> 05:06:09,620
Oh, I don't like this part.

5846
05:06:09,620 --> 05:06:10,400
But first...

5847
05:06:10,400 --> 05:06:11,020
It hurts.

5848
05:06:11,160 --> 05:06:12,240
Oh, I don't like this part.

5849
05:06:12,240 --> 05:06:15,620
I will make him pay for hurting Ivan.

5850
05:06:16,160 --> 05:06:16,600
Ivan.

5851
05:06:21,980 --> 05:06:23,580
Oh, I hate this.

5852
05:06:23,920 --> 05:06:28,140
It just hurts so much watching him get beat up.

5853
05:06:29,140 --> 05:06:30,500
Oh, Snake!

5854
05:06:31,220 --> 05:06:32,300
It's like...

5855
05:06:32,300 --> 05:06:33,740
It's like MGS4.

5856
05:06:33,960 --> 05:06:34,660
It's just so...

5857
05:06:36,900 --> 05:06:37,640
Oh, my god!

5858
05:06:47,330 --> 05:06:48,890
She's just punching him.

5859
05:06:49,110 --> 05:06:50,910
Awe, boss...

5860
05:06:52,850 --> 05:06:56,490
I also like seeing him a little bloody.

5861
05:07:02,450 --> 05:07:03,170
Ugh...

5862
05:07:05,670 --> 05:07:06,870
Oh my god.

5863
05:07:08,530 --> 05:07:11,830
He takes all of this and then also the torture scene.

5864
05:07:11,970 --> 05:07:12,390
It's insane.

5865
05:07:16,460 --> 05:07:17,020
No!

5866
05:07:19,200 --> 05:07:19,760
Snake!

5867
05:07:19,820 --> 05:07:20,380
Snake!

5868
05:07:21,200 --> 05:07:23,080
Why don't you fight back, Snake?

5869
05:07:23,320 --> 05:07:24,520
Why don't you fight back?

5870
05:07:36,730 --> 05:07:40,050
Oh god, it's so... oh it's so gross.

5871
05:07:40,470 --> 05:07:41,730
It's so awful.

5872
05:07:41,970 --> 05:07:44,190
Oh Snake, how are you even still standing?

5873
05:07:49,140 --> 05:07:50,720
How do you still have teeth?

5874
05:07:57,930 --> 05:08:00,490
Just another Sunday for Solid Snake.

5875
05:08:06,810 --> 05:08:08,230
You're absolutely correct.

5876
05:08:12,770 --> 05:08:13,130
No!

5877
05:08:18,310 --> 05:08:20,450
No, that is not Solid Snake!

5878
05:08:22,190 --> 05:08:23,970
No, that is not Solid Snake!

5879
05:08:31,550 --> 05:08:32,470
Bad end.

5880
05:08:33,170 --> 05:08:34,830
And that's the end of the game, guys.

5881
05:08:35,930 --> 05:08:36,490
GG.

5882
05:08:36,750 --> 05:08:37,610
He is dead.

5883
05:08:39,410 --> 05:08:41,230
The rest of the series never happens.

5884
05:08:48,320 --> 05:08:48,800
Oh...

5885
05:08:57,880 --> 05:08:59,180
It's so cool, love!

5886
05:09:05,020 --> 05:09:06,480
He's really taking it, though.

5887
05:09:07,360 --> 05:09:09,240
How can you do this to him?

5888
05:09:09,380 --> 05:09:11,540
I know you gave the data to someone.

5889
05:09:11,860 --> 05:09:12,780
I never did that.

5890
05:09:12,780 --> 05:09:12,900
You!

5891
05:09:22,350 --> 05:09:23,270
Sokolov?

5892
05:09:23,270 --> 05:09:24,190
Sokolov?

5893
05:09:26,270 --> 05:09:26,730
Sokolov?

5894
05:09:26,910 --> 05:09:27,450
Are you okay?

5895
05:09:31,430 --> 05:09:34,090
I guess he's dead.

5896
05:09:40,420 --> 05:09:41,340
Sokolov?

5897
05:09:44,320 --> 05:09:45,680
Oh god.

5898
05:09:48,300 --> 05:09:50,300
The sound design here is just...

5899
05:09:55,600 --> 05:09:56,720
Oh wait, here we go.

5900
05:10:09,360 --> 05:10:10,940
Do you like what you see?

5901
05:10:14,160 --> 05:10:15,140
I wonder if...

5902
05:10:15,720 --> 05:10:17,780
if that will change?

5903
05:10:17,780 --> 05:10:21,100
I am about to show you what hell is really like.

5904
05:10:21,100 --> 05:10:24,200
It would be so cool if that would change in Delta, considering they're gonna have you like...

5905
05:10:24,200 --> 05:10:24,900
Well then...

5906
05:10:24,900 --> 05:10:26,560
Let's get started.

5907
05:10:26,560 --> 05:10:29,580
Have your body get more scarred or whatever the more you get shot at.

5908
05:10:29,580 --> 05:10:30,480
What is your target?

5909
05:10:33,360 --> 05:10:34,920
Is it the Shagohod?

5910
05:10:37,040 --> 05:10:38,160
Or Sokolov?

5911
05:10:38,700 --> 05:10:40,360
Or maybe it's the Legacy?

5912
05:10:40,820 --> 05:10:43,960
Answer me!

5913
05:10:44,540 --> 05:10:45,860
Who is helping you?

5914
05:10:46,540 --> 05:10:47,660
Answer me!

5915
05:10:47,660 --> 05:10:47,660
Who is helping you?

5916
05:10:47,780 --> 05:10:49,240
Who let you in here?

5917
05:10:50,480 --> 05:10:51,840
Oh my health!

5918
05:10:53,500 --> 05:10:54,700
You're a tough one.

5919
05:10:54,740 --> 05:10:55,600
I'm a tough cookie.

5920
05:10:55,820 --> 05:10:57,240
But even you must have your limits.

5921
05:10:57,320 --> 05:10:58,040
No, no, no.

5922
05:10:58,260 --> 05:11:00,600
And I am a patient man.

5923
05:11:00,720 --> 05:11:02,060
Oh my god, I have to go to the bathroom again.

5924
05:11:02,260 --> 05:11:04,320
I'm sorry, I've been drinking so much coffee and tea.

5925
05:11:06,300 --> 05:11:07,600
Can we see now?

5926
05:11:07,860 --> 05:11:08,260
Yay!

5927
05:11:16,060 --> 05:11:18,080
Here's where the fun really begins.

5928
05:11:18,080 --> 05:11:20,100
You say this, you.

5929
05:11:20,700 --> 05:11:22,300
You say this, you.

5930
05:11:22,680 --> 05:11:26,960
My body carries an electric charge of 10 million volts.

5931
05:11:27,620 --> 05:11:29,480
Let's see how you like this.

5932
05:11:32,340 --> 05:11:33,960
Snake, just hold out, Snake.

5933
05:11:38,040 --> 05:11:38,680
Snake...

5934
05:11:38,680 --> 05:11:39,820
Now answer me.

5935
05:11:40,500 --> 05:11:42,660
How much does the CIA know?

5936
05:11:46,120 --> 05:11:48,120
You won't get a word out of me.

5937
05:11:48,240 --> 05:11:51,660
Oh my gosh, not even Ocelot can watch this.

5938
05:11:51,860 --> 05:11:54,040
They're after my legacy, aren't they?

5939
05:11:57,900 --> 05:12:01,320
Your real target is the Philosopher's Legacy, isn't it?

5940
05:12:01,380 --> 05:12:02,520
I don't even know what that is!

5941
05:12:10,440 --> 05:12:12,500
I don't even know what that is!

5942
05:12:12,500 --> 05:12:12,520
I don't even know what that is!

5943
05:12:12,520 --> 05:12:12,640
I don't even know what that is!

5944
05:12:12,640 --> 05:12:14,640
Oh my god, Ocelot...

5945
05:12:14,640 --> 05:12:15,480
Doki doki!

5946
05:12:15,820 --> 05:12:16,780
Doki doki!

5947
05:12:16,980 --> 05:12:17,940
Oh my gosh!

5948
05:12:18,480 --> 05:12:19,540
Yes, yes.

5949
05:12:20,200 --> 05:12:21,620
Let yourself go.

5950
05:12:23,340 --> 05:12:25,020
That's what I want to see.

5951
05:12:27,160 --> 05:12:28,040
Don't worry, Snake.

5952
05:12:29,140 --> 05:12:32,400
You're much cooler than Sokolov and Huey or...

5953
05:12:32,400 --> 05:12:34,540
I mean, sorry, Ocelot and, you know...

5954
05:12:34,540 --> 05:12:35,680
He's a Pikachu.

5955
05:12:36,020 --> 05:12:36,620
It's no use.

5956
05:12:36,980 --> 05:12:38,300
He's not going to talk.

5957
05:12:40,640 --> 05:12:42,360
He's been trained not to break.

5958
05:12:43,820 --> 05:12:44,980
Trained by me.

5959
05:12:45,500 --> 05:12:46,820
Trained by me.

5960
05:12:47,440 --> 05:12:49,140
That bag is like...

5961
05:12:50,060 --> 05:12:50,800
Admit it!

5962
05:12:50,920 --> 05:12:52,500
We're after the location of the legacy!

5963
05:12:55,080 --> 05:13:00,100
The secret fund established by the three great powers during the two world wars.

5964
05:13:00,280 --> 05:13:02,660
That's what you're looking for, isn't it?

5965
05:13:03,020 --> 05:13:04,300
I don't know what that...

5966
05:13:04,300 --> 05:13:10,720
One hundred billion dollars divided up and hidden all over the world.

5967
05:13:11,000 --> 05:13:11,560
Ahhh!

5968
05:13:12,640 --> 05:13:12,960
Ahhh!

5969
05:13:14,080 --> 05:13:17,900
And you're looking for a record of where all that money is hidden, right?

5970
05:13:17,900 --> 05:13:18,420
Oh my God!

5971
05:13:19,660 --> 05:13:22,760
He's doing that villain thing where he just explains everything.

5972
05:13:23,200 --> 05:13:24,760
He explains his whole plot.

5973
05:13:25,120 --> 05:13:26,300
Or his whole, like, scheme, you know?

5974
05:13:26,300 --> 05:13:29,000
The philosopher's legacy is safely in my possession.

5975
05:13:29,040 --> 05:13:29,940
Yeah, now I am!

5976
05:13:32,800 --> 05:13:33,920
Oh, really?

5977
05:13:34,240 --> 05:13:35,460
Okay, thank you!

5978
05:13:35,480 --> 05:13:37,380
Never think about it.

5979
05:13:38,940 --> 05:13:39,500
Ahhh!

5980
05:13:39,500 --> 05:13:39,540
Ahhh!

5981
05:13:45,490 --> 05:13:46,150
What's that?

5982
05:13:48,490 --> 05:13:49,290
What's this?

5983
05:13:49,770 --> 05:13:50,970
A transmitter.

5984
05:13:53,830 --> 05:13:55,870
Who's responsible for this?

5985
05:13:57,090 --> 05:13:58,150
No, no.

5986
05:13:58,370 --> 05:13:59,230
I am.

5987
05:13:59,410 --> 05:14:03,870
I planted it on him to keep track of his movements.

5988
05:14:04,150 --> 05:14:06,010
Be careful, there's a spy in this room.

5989
05:14:06,430 --> 05:14:06,970
Yeah.

5990
05:14:07,530 --> 05:14:08,730
Just one, hopefully.

5991
05:14:09,330 --> 05:14:09,870
Anthony!

5992
05:14:10,330 --> 05:14:10,830
Welcome to membership!

5993
05:14:10,970 --> 05:14:11,270
Thank you!

5994
05:14:11,270 --> 05:14:11,430
Cool.

5995
05:14:11,750 --> 05:14:16,310
If they knew where he was gonna be, they wouldn't have gotten themselves slaughtered.

5996
05:14:18,030 --> 05:14:21,230
Oh, do you want to know where the philosopher's legacy is?

5997
05:14:22,350 --> 05:14:23,810
Yeah, do you want to know?

5998
05:14:23,810 --> 05:14:25,290
You don't know what the philosopher's legacy is?

5999
05:14:25,350 --> 05:14:28,950
I must ask you to show me some proof that you and he were not in collusion.

6000
05:14:29,070 --> 05:14:30,030
It's a bunch of money.

6001
05:14:30,130 --> 05:14:31,450
Is that what you're looking for?

6002
05:14:31,490 --> 05:14:34,970
You wouldn't find it unless you look in the underground vault in the film Grasnagrad.

6003
05:14:35,630 --> 05:14:37,130
What do you want me to do?

6004
05:14:38,830 --> 05:14:39,430
Let's see.

6005
05:14:42,770 --> 05:14:43,250
Snake.

6006
05:14:43,650 --> 05:14:44,950
Cut out his eyes.

6007
05:14:48,170 --> 05:14:50,690
I don't like those blue eyes of his.

6008
05:14:50,790 --> 05:14:50,990
What?

6009
05:14:52,170 --> 05:14:54,990
There's nothing more important to a soldier than his eyes.

6010
05:14:55,010 --> 05:14:55,870
He hates that meme.

6011
05:14:55,890 --> 05:14:58,950
You made him a soldier, and now you will unmake him.

6012
05:14:59,070 --> 05:15:02,270
Of the guy with the big blue eyes with the arms crossed.

6013
05:15:03,770 --> 05:15:05,310
Not as big as the beautiful blue eyes.

6014
05:15:05,310 --> 05:15:05,470
He's all yours.

6015
05:15:12,170 --> 05:15:12,790
Ruin him.

6016
05:15:12,990 --> 05:15:14,910
Just as he did the cobras.

6017
05:15:14,930 --> 05:15:17,450
All the blue-eyed people in the room are like Don't do it.

6018
05:15:19,010 --> 05:15:19,950
Don't do it.

6019
05:15:23,210 --> 05:15:25,050
Yeah, he would hate Gojo Satoru.

6020
05:15:25,090 --> 05:15:25,410
So true.

6021
05:15:26,930 --> 05:15:27,570
Oh my god.

6022
05:15:35,530 --> 05:15:37,330
Ocelot, you are so weird.

6023
05:15:38,030 --> 05:15:39,230
He's like, nah, you should watch.

6024
05:15:40,310 --> 05:15:42,410
Why are you such a freak?

6025
05:15:45,230 --> 05:15:46,830
No, you need to watch this.

6026
05:15:47,010 --> 05:15:47,770
Check it out.

6027
05:15:48,070 --> 05:15:48,970
Oh my god.

6028
05:15:49,070 --> 05:15:49,690
No!

6029
05:15:55,750 --> 05:15:56,430
Stop!

6030
05:15:58,830 --> 05:16:00,230
What is it, Tanya?

6031
05:16:01,650 --> 05:16:02,990
He's suffered enough.

6032
05:16:03,670 --> 05:16:04,790
Well, well.

6033
05:16:04,790 --> 05:16:05,330
Hmm?

6034
05:16:07,250 --> 05:16:08,790
Why are you protecting him?

6035
05:16:09,090 --> 05:16:10,990
Stop pointing your fingers at my face.

6036
05:16:14,770 --> 05:16:15,690
That smell.

6037
05:16:16,110 --> 05:16:17,470
Yeah, smelly smell.

6038
05:16:18,550 --> 05:16:19,310
Smelly smell.

6039
05:16:19,370 --> 05:16:20,950
It smells smelly.

6040
05:16:20,990 --> 05:16:21,350
Tatiana.

6041
05:16:21,770 --> 05:16:22,290
Yeah?

6042
05:16:22,490 --> 05:16:23,410
You're the spy.

6043
05:16:23,970 --> 05:16:24,490
What?

6044
05:16:24,650 --> 05:16:25,530
What are you talking about?

6045
05:16:25,530 --> 05:16:26,330
On what grounds?

6046
05:16:26,370 --> 05:16:27,850
Don't look so suspicious, Eva, please.

6047
05:16:27,910 --> 05:16:28,410
I mean Tatiana.

6048
05:16:28,510 --> 05:16:29,030
Oh gosh.

6049
05:16:31,230 --> 05:16:32,810
I know that smell.

6050
05:16:32,810 --> 05:16:33,610
What's that smell?

6051
05:16:35,030 --> 05:16:36,930
It's the smell of a bitch.

6052
05:16:37,290 --> 05:16:38,150
Stop it.

6053
05:16:38,590 --> 05:16:38,890
Yeah.

6054
05:16:41,650 --> 05:16:42,850
Stop smiling.

6055
05:16:43,270 --> 05:16:43,510
No.

6056
05:16:43,790 --> 05:16:45,430
I have no interest in this woman.

6057
05:16:45,430 --> 05:16:46,050
And women, sorry.

6058
05:16:47,290 --> 05:16:49,110
I want to test her.

6059
05:16:54,610 --> 05:16:55,550
Vulcan is...

6060
05:16:55,550 --> 05:16:56,830
I'll let this be the judge.

6061
05:16:56,830 --> 05:16:59,010
This is like the freakiest room you'll ever see.

6062
05:16:59,010 --> 05:17:03,510
The freakiest freaks that will ever be together in a room ever.

6063
05:17:03,730 --> 05:17:04,650
Here we go.

6064
05:17:05,750 --> 05:17:07,870
Oh, just like with Sokolov.

6065
05:17:30,870 --> 05:17:31,510
There.

6066
05:17:33,630 --> 05:17:34,470
Satisfied now.

6067
05:17:34,890 --> 05:17:35,690
Oh god.

6068
05:17:37,270 --> 05:17:39,170
Well, that was refreshing.

6069
05:17:41,550 --> 05:17:42,190
Come.

6070
05:17:42,450 --> 05:17:43,430
We're going to my room.

6071
05:17:43,650 --> 05:17:44,130
Oh, oh.

6072
05:17:44,250 --> 05:17:45,430
He's just like...

6073
05:17:45,550 --> 05:17:47,230
She started crying.

6074
05:17:47,550 --> 05:17:49,070
I need to get to the bedroom stat.

6075
05:17:49,450 --> 05:17:50,350
Oh my god.

6076
05:17:52,810 --> 05:17:54,250
Oh my god.

6077
05:18:05,840 --> 05:18:08,970
You are such a freak.

6078
05:18:11,370 --> 05:18:13,890
Watching this has made me realize something.

6079
05:18:16,470 --> 05:18:17,970
It's really not that bad.

6080
05:18:18,150 --> 05:18:18,690
Oh my god.

6081
05:18:20,090 --> 05:18:22,350
It's the ultimate form of expression.

6082
05:18:22,670 --> 05:18:23,030
It's the ultimate form of expression.

6083
05:18:23,030 --> 05:18:24,390
Oh god.

6084
05:18:27,490 --> 05:18:30,570
The ultimate form of showing your love.

6085
05:18:31,870 --> 05:18:32,590
The ultimate form of showing your love.

6086
05:18:32,590 --> 05:18:33,750
You got lucky this time.

6087
05:18:33,750 --> 05:18:36,230
But I'm going to use the Super Chat thank you.

6088
05:18:37,530 --> 05:18:38,710
You got lucky this time.

6089
05:18:38,710 --> 05:18:39,790
The ultimate form...

6090
05:18:39,790 --> 05:18:40,430
of expression.

6091
05:18:42,910 --> 05:18:44,350
So romantic.

6092
05:18:47,370 --> 05:18:51,450
This freak, you freak, this freak, freak, freaky, freak, freak, freak, man, freak.

6093
05:18:57,990 --> 05:19:00,270
Boss, don't do it.

6094
05:19:01,750 --> 05:19:02,150
144.

6095
05:19:10,150 --> 05:19:11,230
144.75 Run!

6096
05:19:14,970 --> 05:19:15,770
144.75!

6097
05:19:27,480 --> 05:19:28,540
Do you still love me?

6098
05:19:28,540 --> 05:19:30,260
I prepared an escape route for us.

6099
05:19:30,360 --> 05:19:31,580
Go out and head west.

6100
05:19:31,740 --> 05:19:32,580
West, okay, west.

6101
05:19:32,880 --> 05:19:35,580
Pass underneath the connecting passageway and go north.

6102
05:19:35,840 --> 05:19:37,500
You'll find an open manhole there.

6103
05:19:38,280 --> 05:19:38,760
You're...

6104
05:19:38,760 --> 05:19:39,020
Quiet!

6105
05:19:41,560 --> 05:19:43,860
Go through the manhole down into the sewers.

6106
05:19:44,000 --> 05:19:45,900
The door at the north end of the sewers is unlocked.

6107
05:19:45,900 --> 05:19:46,800
Wait, did he just realize?

6108
05:19:47,120 --> 05:19:48,620
You can use it to get outside the fortress.

6109
05:19:49,400 --> 05:19:50,520
I've got your equipment.

6110
05:19:50,800 --> 05:19:51,740
He just noticed?

6111
05:19:52,120 --> 05:19:52,440
We'll meet up later.

6112
05:19:55,620 --> 05:19:56,100
Eva.

6113
05:19:57,060 --> 05:19:58,520
But I can't get too close.

6114
05:19:58,540 --> 05:19:59,060
You're too close to your cell.

6115
05:20:00,000 --> 05:20:01,820
You'll have to figure a way out of there yourself.

6116
05:20:01,920 --> 05:20:02,040
He's kind of dense.

6117
05:20:03,300 --> 05:20:04,200
I'll be honest though.

6118
05:20:04,260 --> 05:20:08,720
The first time I played this, it did take me a while to realize that they were both the same.

6119
05:20:08,740 --> 05:20:09,200
I'll be in touch.

6120
05:20:09,680 --> 05:20:10,960
I didn't know either.

6121
05:20:11,080 --> 05:20:11,600
I'll be honest.

6122
05:20:11,960 --> 05:20:12,920
And for a long while.

6123
05:20:13,200 --> 05:20:14,540
Not until up to here, but...

6124
05:20:16,940 --> 05:20:20,860
Ocelot, you freakishly freak zoid of a freak, utterly freakish freakery.

6125
05:20:21,600 --> 05:20:21,960
Phantom.

6126
05:20:22,680 --> 05:20:23,700
Phantom von Mito.

6127
05:20:31,020 --> 05:20:33,360
llegar aima pareja o a mia Oh, wait, hold on.

6128
05:20:33,460 --> 05:20:34,140
Thank you.

6129
05:20:34,460 --> 05:20:35,760
I see a light.

6130
05:20:35,860 --> 05:20:36,760
Happy birthday.

6131
05:20:40,920 --> 05:20:45,960
Happy birthday, モ Happy birthday to you.

6132
05:20:46,320 --> 05:20:48,780
Happy birthday to you.

6133
05:20:49,120 --> 05:20:52,020
Happy birthday, I see a light.

6134
05:20:53,500 --> 05:20:56,960
Happy birthday to you.

6135
05:20:59,260 --> 05:21:00,120
Happy birthday!

6136
05:21:01,920 --> 05:21:02,840
Happy, happy birthday.

6137
05:21:21,970 --> 05:21:23,790
When is the dream sequence?

6138
05:21:26,910 --> 05:21:31,170
Why would you send that to me?

6139
05:21:32,550 --> 05:21:33,890
Why would you send that to me?

6140
05:21:35,730 --> 05:21:36,630
I got a fork.

6141
05:21:37,450 --> 05:21:38,010
Hell yeah.

6142
05:21:38,230 --> 05:21:38,730
Time to eat!

6143
05:21:40,930 --> 05:21:42,210
I don't want any bad.

6144
05:21:52,190 --> 05:21:53,130
I don't want this.

6145
05:21:54,350 --> 05:21:55,570
When is the...

6146
05:21:57,510 --> 05:21:58,770
Why is my aim so bad?

6147
05:22:01,810 --> 05:22:03,990
When was the dream sequence?

6148
05:22:04,230 --> 05:22:05,310
Wasn't it supposed to be...

6149
05:22:05,910 --> 05:22:06,950
Wasn't it supposed to happen?

6150
05:22:09,270 --> 05:22:11,050
Isn't there a dream sequence you can do in here?

6151
05:22:11,090 --> 05:22:12,250
Yeah, like...

6152
05:22:14,170 --> 05:22:15,890
Oh, you have to save in the prison.

6153
05:22:16,050 --> 05:22:17,230
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

6154
05:22:17,430 --> 05:22:18,850
Save and quit in the prison.

6155
05:22:24,920 --> 05:22:25,320
Yeah.

6156
05:22:26,760 --> 05:22:27,520
Save and quit.

6157
05:22:27,740 --> 05:22:28,900
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

6158
05:22:29,220 --> 05:22:30,060
I was like, wait a second.

6159
05:22:30,120 --> 05:22:31,320
I thought it would happen.

6160
05:22:31,800 --> 05:22:32,840
I'm gonna do a new file.

6161
05:22:36,020 --> 05:22:38,360
Turn the game console off right now.

6162
05:22:41,780 --> 05:22:42,380
All right.

6163
05:22:42,380 --> 05:22:45,640
And I have it as a new file, so if I ever want to come back to it.

6164
05:22:47,380 --> 05:22:48,280
Didn't you want to take a break?

6165
05:22:48,360 --> 05:22:48,820
I did.

6166
05:22:48,920 --> 05:22:49,840
I do have to go to the bathroom.

6167
05:22:51,480 --> 05:22:51,840
Snake?

6168
05:22:51,840 --> 05:22:52,200
Yeah?

6169
05:22:53,420 --> 05:22:53,780
Awe.

6170
05:22:53,780 --> 05:22:54,140
Snake?

6171
05:22:54,600 --> 05:22:54,960
Awe.

6172
05:22:55,120 --> 05:22:56,720
My mouth hurts when I talk.

6173
05:22:56,960 --> 05:22:57,300
Awe.

6174
05:22:57,360 --> 05:22:58,300
Did you get cut up?

6175
05:22:59,500 --> 05:23:01,400
It feels like someone shoved me into a long war.

6176
05:23:01,400 --> 05:23:02,680
Paramedic, why are you so rude?

6177
05:23:03,020 --> 05:23:03,800
Do me a favor.

6178
05:23:04,400 --> 05:23:06,720
Tell me a story to take my mind off the pain.

6179
05:23:07,500 --> 05:23:09,400
Snake, have you ever heard of Renfield?

6180
05:23:09,400 --> 05:23:10,940
Is that a movie?

6181
05:23:11,340 --> 05:23:12,720
It's the name of a character.

6182
05:23:13,580 --> 05:23:18,320
He's locked up in a cell waiting for the master to return, eating the spiders that crawl along the walls.

6183
05:23:18,840 --> 05:23:20,480
Ugh, change the channel.

6184
05:23:20,720 --> 05:23:22,340
He waits and waits for ages.

6185
05:23:22,940 --> 05:23:28,820
Finally, just as he's beginning to forget whether he's human or not, the master comes for him, saying, the time has come.

6186
05:23:29,460 --> 05:23:30,840
Renfield is overjoyed.

6187
05:23:30,940 --> 05:23:32,400
Wait, isn't this?

6188
05:23:32,580 --> 05:23:36,220
The master spreads his huge wings and a gust of wind fills the cell.

6189
05:23:36,440 --> 05:23:36,980
Come on.

6190
05:23:37,080 --> 05:23:38,440
I don't want to hear this.

6191
05:23:38,440 --> 05:23:42,260
And there, standing before Renfield in human form was...

6192
05:23:42,260 --> 05:23:42,560
Dracula.

6193
05:23:42,880 --> 05:23:43,320
Dracula.

6194
05:23:43,640 --> 05:23:44,080
Exactly.

6195
05:23:44,720 --> 05:23:48,720
If you stay there too long, your old buddy Dracula is going to come and get you too.

6196
05:23:48,720 --> 05:23:50,120
That's why he has the bad dream.

6197
05:23:50,140 --> 05:23:51,300
So you'd better start thinking of a way out of there.

6198
05:23:52,900 --> 05:23:55,080
You'd better not leave me without someone to talk to.

6199
05:23:56,820 --> 05:23:58,340
Please, Snake, think.

6200
05:23:58,700 --> 05:24:00,380
There's got to be a way out of there.

6201
05:24:00,940 --> 05:24:01,560
I'll try.

6202
05:24:01,980 --> 05:24:03,260
That's why he has a bad dream.

6203
05:24:03,560 --> 05:24:05,940
Just let me know if you start having nightmares about Dracula.

6204
05:24:06,240 --> 05:24:06,640
I do.

6205
05:24:09,260 --> 05:24:11,000
Alright, give me one second.

6206
05:24:12,520 --> 05:24:16,900
Here, I'll let Johnny... you can watch him do his thing.

6207
05:24:17,200 --> 05:24:22,560
I'm going to go to the bathroom and then I'll restart my PS2.

6208
05:24:29,800 --> 05:24:30,200
BRB.

6209
05:24:30,320 --> 05:24:31,820
And I'm going to get some more tea.

6210
05:24:32,000 --> 05:24:34,000
Because I have... I need a hydration check.

6211
05:24:34,300 --> 05:24:37,360
I have no hydration if I haven't had hydration for like an hour and a half.

6212
05:24:39,500 --> 05:24:40,500
So...

6213
05:24:40,500 --> 05:24:42,640
So, BRB.

6214
05:24:43,640 --> 05:24:47,400
Yes, BRB.

6215
05:25:23,790 --> 05:25:25,010
Chow time.

6216
05:26:06,970 --> 05:26:08,570
Oh, my stomach.

6217
05:26:11,110 --> 05:26:12,690
Oh, God.

6218
05:26:14,930 --> 05:26:17,290
Oh, I can't hold it anymore.

6219
05:26:25,260 --> 05:26:26,440
It's coming.

6220
05:26:26,440 --> 05:26:26,860
It's coming out.

6221
05:26:29,840 --> 05:26:31,040
Here it comes.

6222
05:26:32,140 --> 05:26:35,240
Uh, still going.

6223
05:26:38,690 --> 05:26:41,350
Wow, I didn't think that was possible.

6224
05:26:44,090 --> 05:26:45,350
That's a record.

6225
05:26:46,230 --> 05:26:50,920
Will this even flush?

6226
05:27:01,580 --> 05:27:03,180
Oh, Jesus.

6227
05:27:35,780 --> 05:27:36,580
Ah.

6228
05:27:36,740 --> 05:27:36,920
Oh.

6229
05:27:57,650 --> 05:27:58,450
Hey.

6230
05:27:58,710 --> 05:27:59,430
Eat up.

6231
05:28:37,430 --> 05:28:38,430
Sorry about that, I'm back.

6232
05:28:38,550 --> 05:28:39,810
I had to feed my kitties too.

6233
05:28:40,610 --> 05:28:42,290
I had to feed my kitties too.

6234
05:28:43,370 --> 05:28:43,770
Okay.

6235
05:28:46,070 --> 05:28:48,050
How was Johnny?

6236
05:28:51,050 --> 05:28:51,890
How was Johnny?

6237
05:28:54,090 --> 05:28:55,450
Did you hear the play-by-play?

6238
05:28:55,550 --> 05:28:56,510
What do you mean the play-by-play?

6239
05:28:56,970 --> 05:28:57,970
Johnny had an episode?

6240
05:28:58,330 --> 05:28:59,430
Oh no, is he okay?

6241
05:29:01,010 --> 05:29:03,970
Johnny brought you food and set a new record.

6242
05:29:04,570 --> 05:29:07,410
You missed Johnny's record breaking too flush out.

6243
05:29:08,430 --> 05:29:09,910
Oh good lord.

6244
05:29:10,330 --> 05:29:11,590
Let's turn off the game.

6245
05:29:11,870 --> 05:29:13,130
Pretend that never happened.

6246
05:29:16,480 --> 05:29:18,800
Pretend that never happened.

6247
05:29:19,500 --> 05:29:21,680
Pretend that never happened.

6248
05:29:26,180 --> 05:29:27,460
Congrats on the new record.

6249
05:29:27,600 --> 05:29:28,060
It wasn't me!

6250
05:29:31,860 --> 05:29:33,060
It wasn't me.

6251
05:29:33,220 --> 05:29:34,320
It wasn't me.

6252
05:29:34,400 --> 05:29:34,700
It wasn't me.

6253
05:29:34,820 --> 05:29:35,240
Boom.

6254
05:29:42,150 --> 05:29:42,670
Nope.

6255
05:29:42,670 --> 05:29:46,350
Sorry, it's gotta like do all its funny things, you know.

6256
05:29:50,510 --> 05:29:51,770
This is gonna be fun.

6257
05:29:51,890 --> 05:29:56,630
Many new players haven't seen Guy Savage Nightmare because it's not an MGS3 HD.

6258
05:29:56,710 --> 05:29:58,570
Just remember to codec everybody afterwards.

6259
05:29:58,790 --> 05:29:59,450
Yes, yes, yes.

6260
05:30:03,190 --> 05:30:03,710
Alright.

6261
05:30:03,710 --> 05:30:06,450
Sorry, I will be skipping Snake Eater intro.

6262
05:30:06,490 --> 05:30:07,290
I'm so sorry!

6263
05:30:08,410 --> 05:30:09,530
What do you mean wow?

6264
05:30:20,090 --> 05:30:21,490
Have I got places to be?

6265
05:30:22,390 --> 05:30:25,930
I was thinking honestly about beating the game today but...

6266
05:30:28,550 --> 05:30:33,770
I decided I'll probably finish after this and then beat it next week.

6267
05:30:35,150 --> 05:30:40,570
I was gonna power on through it but since I'm feeling... I'm starting to get a little bit of a headache and I'm hungry so...

6268
05:30:40,570 --> 05:30:44,550
I think I'll just beat it next week.

6269
05:30:47,370 --> 05:30:48,470
Oh my god.

6270
05:30:48,530 --> 05:30:49,130
What do I...

6271
05:30:49,130 --> 05:30:56,310
Oh my god!

6272
05:30:56,470 --> 05:30:57,250
Metal Gear Rising!

6273
05:30:59,650 --> 05:31:00,630
What's happening to me?

6274
05:31:00,830 --> 05:31:01,730
What's happening to me?

6275
05:31:02,490 --> 05:31:03,530
I'm killing the police!

6276
05:31:03,870 --> 05:31:04,470
Oh my god!

6277
05:31:05,890 --> 05:31:06,370
Wow!

6278
05:31:07,470 --> 05:31:07,950
Wow!

6279
05:31:08,930 --> 05:31:09,410
Wow!

6280
05:31:09,430 --> 05:31:09,650
Wow!

6281
05:31:09,830 --> 05:31:10,330
Oh my god.

6282
05:31:12,410 --> 05:31:12,890
Wow!

6283
05:31:13,150 --> 05:31:13,890
It's so loud.

6284
05:31:17,770 --> 05:31:18,170
Oh my god.

6285
05:31:20,370 --> 05:31:21,810
I'm destroying everything for real.

6286
05:31:22,610 --> 05:31:23,870
I'm destroying everything real.

6287
05:31:27,090 --> 05:31:28,030
Oh my god.

6288
05:31:30,870 --> 05:31:32,210
I just bust through the wall.

6289
05:31:32,290 --> 05:31:32,870
Oh my god!

6290
05:31:33,330 --> 05:31:35,590
Oh, I can't bust through the... I can bust through the walls.

6291
05:31:37,390 --> 05:31:37,790
Wow!

6292
05:31:38,930 --> 05:31:39,330
No!

6293
05:31:40,310 --> 05:31:41,970
I can't... I can bust through this.

6294
05:31:42,110 --> 05:31:43,190
I can bust through this.

6295
05:31:43,190 --> 05:31:45,610
I can bust through this but I can't bust through the bus.

6296
05:31:47,810 --> 05:31:49,010
Bust through the bus!

6297
05:31:51,530 --> 05:31:52,490
Never mind.

6298
05:31:54,690 --> 05:31:55,970
Stop the bomb!

6299
05:31:59,530 --> 05:32:01,090
I see more things are here.

6300
05:32:02,670 --> 05:32:04,330
Thanks for keeping coming...

6301
05:32:04,330 --> 05:32:06,590
Oh my gosh!

6302
05:32:07,650 --> 05:32:09,090
A 15 hour work day!

6303
05:32:09,170 --> 05:32:09,910
Is that what you just said?

6304
05:32:10,090 --> 05:32:10,890
Oh my gosh.

6305
05:32:11,070 --> 05:32:11,370
Oh, two!

6306
05:32:14,170 --> 05:32:14,990
Oh my god.

6307
05:32:15,010 --> 05:32:17,450
The more I kill, the more I thrive!

6308
05:32:18,210 --> 05:32:20,730
The more I kill, the more I crave!

6309
05:32:21,470 --> 05:32:22,010
Yes!

6310
05:32:22,050 --> 05:32:23,810
I'm becoming Super Saiyan!

6311
05:32:24,490 --> 05:32:25,010
Yeah!

6312
05:32:28,850 --> 05:32:32,230
They become slow-mo and I become crazy hack and slash.

6313
05:32:35,450 --> 05:32:37,250
You try to escape me?

6314
05:32:37,950 --> 05:32:39,690
Try to get out of my clutches?

6315
05:32:40,030 --> 05:32:42,190
I feel like I'm really destroying these guys.

6316
05:32:42,190 --> 05:32:43,650
But they just keep standing up.

6317
05:32:43,950 --> 05:32:45,170
They keep getting up.

6318
05:32:55,120 --> 05:32:58,480
I can't believe I've been a fan of MGS so long and never knew this existed.

6319
05:33:00,460 --> 05:33:00,900
Yeah.

6320
05:33:01,400 --> 05:33:02,340
Only in the...

6321
05:33:03,660 --> 05:33:04,840
It's in the subsistence.

6322
05:33:04,940 --> 05:33:05,300
Yeah, yeah.

6323
05:33:13,680 --> 05:33:15,860
I had a scary nightmare about Dracula, man.

6324
05:33:24,590 --> 05:33:25,430
Just a fever.

6325
05:33:25,550 --> 05:33:25,630
Yeah.

6326
05:33:25,630 --> 05:33:29,170
Don't talk about Dracula and then let Snake go to sleep, everybody.

6327
05:33:30,370 --> 05:33:31,490
He'll have nightmares!

6328
05:33:33,110 --> 05:33:34,370
He'll have nightmares!

6329
05:33:41,120 --> 05:33:44,740
There's so many things that you can miss in this game, especially if you like don't...

6330
05:33:45,820 --> 05:33:48,320
Like if you don't follow certain... what's it called?

6331
05:33:50,740 --> 05:33:52,440
Like if you like... if you don't follow...

6332
05:33:53,120 --> 05:33:57,680
Like for that, you have to save the game here and then stop playing here.

6333
05:33:57,800 --> 05:33:58,760
Or else you'll never get it.

6334
05:33:59,760 --> 05:34:01,700
No one believed me that it was real.

6335
05:34:07,720 --> 05:34:08,200
Oh!

6336
05:34:14,160 --> 05:34:15,200
I'm still fishing, thank you.

6337
05:34:15,400 --> 05:34:16,400
Thank you!

6338
05:34:17,460 --> 05:34:17,940
Thank you!

6339
05:34:17,940 --> 05:34:20,600
Back in England, we don't call stuff like that fine spirit.

6340
05:34:21,420 --> 05:34:22,420
We call it...

6341
05:34:22,420 --> 05:34:23,540
Sulfuric acid.

6342
05:34:23,760 --> 05:34:23,840
Ooh.

6343
05:34:24,520 --> 05:34:27,820
Imagine, if you will, your internal organs being slowly eaten away.

6344
05:34:27,820 --> 05:34:29,720
The smoke pours out of your mouth.

6345
05:34:30,320 --> 05:34:31,040
Really, Snake.

6346
05:34:31,260 --> 05:34:32,580
You shouldn't be touching that.

6347
05:34:32,640 --> 05:34:33,200
I'm not!

6348
05:34:33,200 --> 05:34:34,160
I'm not drinking!

6349
05:34:34,700 --> 05:34:34,860
A dream.

6350
05:34:35,160 --> 05:34:36,320
Well, how nice.

6351
05:34:36,700 --> 05:34:40,160
And here I thought I sat up all night worrying about you for nothing.

6352
05:34:40,320 --> 05:34:40,620
Okay.

6353
05:34:40,880 --> 05:34:41,800
Okay, Major.

6354
05:34:42,360 --> 05:34:44,480
I was holding this sword in my hand.

6355
05:34:44,740 --> 05:34:45,800
Snake, are you okay?

6356
05:34:45,900 --> 05:34:47,380
You're not going loony on me, are you?

6357
05:34:47,960 --> 05:34:48,720
Not at all.

6358
05:34:49,260 --> 05:34:52,920
I'll make it back no matter how much of that sulfuric acid they make me drink.

6359
05:34:53,020 --> 05:34:53,800
Okay, Major.

6360
05:34:53,800 --> 05:34:54,260
Good show.

6361
05:34:54,460 --> 05:34:55,120
You don't have to be so rude.

6362
05:34:55,120 --> 05:34:56,260
I'm sure you'll find a way out of there.

6363
05:34:56,260 --> 05:34:56,940
Yeah.

6364
05:34:57,820 --> 05:35:00,480
Dream a little dream of your own while you're waiting for work from me.

6365
05:35:00,480 --> 05:35:00,800
Dream a dream.

6366
05:35:03,180 --> 05:35:03,760
Oh, yeah.

6367
05:35:03,800 --> 05:35:04,680
There was a...

6368
05:35:04,680 --> 05:35:05,300
Oh, no.

6369
05:35:05,400 --> 05:35:06,260
That was to get out.

6370
05:35:06,360 --> 05:35:08,660
I don't want to do the 144.75.

6371
05:35:10,880 --> 05:35:11,880
Snake, what happened?

6372
05:35:12,160 --> 05:35:13,040
What do you think?

6373
05:35:13,340 --> 05:35:13,520
Yeah.

6374
05:35:13,700 --> 05:35:14,660
Are you not feeling well?

6375
05:35:14,660 --> 05:35:15,200
What do you think, huh?

6376
05:35:15,240 --> 05:35:15,400
No.

6377
05:35:15,500 --> 05:35:15,740
I'm feeling fine.

6378
05:35:15,900 --> 05:35:16,340
Paramedic.

6379
05:35:17,080 --> 05:35:19,540
I had the most amazing dream thanks to you.

6380
05:35:19,880 --> 05:35:20,320
Ah.

6381
05:35:21,120 --> 05:35:23,140
You didn't really dream about Drac.

6382
05:35:23,500 --> 05:35:24,660
Don't say it.

6383
05:35:24,780 --> 05:35:26,240
The last thing I need to know...

6384
05:35:26,260 --> 05:35:27,240
Ah!

6385
05:35:27,660 --> 05:35:28,700
It was surreal.

6386
05:35:29,040 --> 05:35:32,040
I was being attacked by a horde of weird human-like monsters.

6387
05:35:32,540 --> 05:35:33,760
What's wrong with me?

6388
05:35:33,820 --> 05:35:34,380
Don't say it.

6389
05:35:34,480 --> 05:35:36,420
It must be a form of persecution complex.

6390
05:35:36,700 --> 05:35:38,880
Probably triggered by extreme stress.

6391
05:35:39,280 --> 05:35:41,480
The external stimulus of the room is...

6392
05:35:41,480 --> 05:35:42,580
I've got a different theory.

6393
05:35:42,900 --> 05:35:45,580
I think it was caused by your pillow talk.

6394
05:35:45,740 --> 05:35:45,960
Ooh.

6395
05:35:46,340 --> 05:35:47,160
But I didn't...

6396
05:35:47,160 --> 05:35:48,100
Mm-hmm.

6397
05:35:49,120 --> 05:35:50,160
I'm sorry, Snake.

6398
05:35:50,280 --> 05:35:52,520
I didn't know you were that sensitive to it.

6399
05:35:52,620 --> 05:35:54,340
I mean, who'd have thought Drac...

6400
05:35:54,340 --> 05:35:54,540
Ah.

6401
05:35:54,880 --> 05:35:55,300
Ah.

6402
05:35:55,300 --> 05:35:55,600
Ah.

6403
05:35:55,600 --> 05:35:55,760
Ah.

6404
05:35:55,840 --> 05:35:55,940
Ah.

6405
05:35:55,940 --> 05:35:56,120
Ah.

6406
05:35:56,120 --> 05:35:56,240
Ah.

6407
05:35:56,260 --> 05:35:57,000
That just slipped out.

6408
05:35:57,040 --> 05:35:57,380
I swear.

6409
05:35:57,780 --> 05:35:58,260
Ah.

6410
05:35:58,360 --> 05:35:58,540
Ah.

6411
05:35:59,540 --> 05:36:00,600
Come on, Snake.

6412
05:36:00,720 --> 05:36:01,640
Don't be mad at me.

6413
05:36:02,140 --> 05:36:02,960
All right.

6414
05:36:03,140 --> 05:36:04,240
I forgive you.

6415
05:36:04,760 --> 05:36:05,240
Really?

6416
05:36:05,560 --> 05:36:06,380
He's so forgiving.

6417
05:36:06,400 --> 05:36:06,800
Yeah.

6418
05:36:07,020 --> 05:36:07,480
Yeah.

6419
05:36:07,480 --> 05:36:07,760
Good.

6420
05:36:07,880 --> 05:36:08,460
I'm glad.

6421
05:36:08,840 --> 05:36:11,100
Snake, there must be a way out of there.

6422
05:36:11,340 --> 05:36:12,300
Don't get discouraged.

6423
05:36:12,680 --> 05:36:13,520
You'll find it.

6424
05:36:13,740 --> 05:36:14,840
I intend to.

6425
05:36:16,700 --> 05:36:17,180
Don't.

6426
05:36:18,220 --> 05:36:18,700
Don't.

6427
05:36:19,460 --> 05:36:20,380
Bring it up.

6428
05:36:20,540 --> 05:36:22,480
I'm gonna ban the name Drac.

6429
05:36:23,200 --> 05:36:25,040
He who shall not be named in my chat.

6430
05:36:25,240 --> 05:36:26,240
So you guys can't...

6431
05:36:27,760 --> 05:36:28,740
Snake, you okay?

6432
05:36:29,280 --> 05:36:29,520
Eh.

6433
05:36:29,640 --> 05:36:29,780
Yeah.

6434
05:36:30,340 --> 05:36:31,800
I had a terrible dream.

6435
05:36:32,560 --> 05:36:33,200
No kidding.

6436
05:36:33,680 --> 05:36:34,420
What happened?

6437
05:36:35,060 --> 05:36:36,680
I don't want to think about it.

6438
05:36:36,920 --> 05:36:39,180
I was being attacked by monsters that...

6439
05:36:39,180 --> 05:36:41,600
I had a really horrible dream last night, too.

6440
05:36:41,720 --> 05:36:42,000
Not even sure if I was really me.

6441
05:36:42,000 --> 05:36:42,600
Oh, my gosh.

6442
05:36:42,940 --> 05:36:44,260
At least it was just a dream.

6443
05:36:44,560 --> 05:36:45,160
It's all over when you wake up.

6444
05:36:45,160 --> 05:36:47,120
I actually had a really horrible dream.

6445
05:36:47,300 --> 05:36:47,320
True.

6446
05:36:47,680 --> 05:36:48,120
Alucard.

6447
05:36:48,260 --> 05:36:54,100
When you think about it, the fact that you can imagine a situation worse than the one you're in now means life can't be all that bad.

6448
05:36:54,860 --> 05:36:56,180
I sure hope so.

6449
05:36:56,220 --> 05:36:56,240
Yeah.

6450
05:36:56,260 --> 05:36:58,440
I'm scared of talking about it in my dream.

6451
05:36:58,780 --> 05:37:01,260
Let me tell you about the absolute worst, most sickening nightmare I ever had.

6452
05:37:01,440 --> 05:37:01,560
Oh?

6453
05:37:01,840 --> 05:37:03,020
This isn't one for the kids.

6454
05:37:03,100 --> 05:37:03,420
Oh, my God.

6455
05:37:03,520 --> 05:37:04,560
Kids, plug your ears.

6456
05:37:04,820 --> 05:37:04,880
Okay.

6457
05:37:04,880 --> 05:37:06,180
So there's this big pile of crap, right?

6458
05:37:06,360 --> 05:37:13,280
It's shaped like a giant tank and it's walking around on two legs going on a rampage and stomping on people and houses and stuff.

6459
05:37:13,820 --> 05:37:18,340
And this giant turd is carrying the nastiest missiles you ever saw.

6460
05:37:18,480 --> 05:37:25,040
Like whenever it launches one of its turd missiles, whatever it hits, people, trees, buildings...

6461
05:37:26,900 --> 05:37:32,420
My hometown, my old school, my family, my girlfriend, old man John.

6462
05:37:32,960 --> 05:37:33,860
Metal Gear shit.

6463
05:37:33,860 --> 05:37:36,380
Everything in that turd's path turned into shit.

6464
05:37:37,600 --> 05:37:38,920
That's... pretty sick.

6465
05:37:39,340 --> 05:37:41,320
Good thing it was just a dream, huh?

6466
05:37:41,580 --> 05:37:42,020
Sir 4 in blue.

6467
05:37:42,020 --> 05:37:43,620
Yes, that's a good thing.

6468
05:37:44,240 --> 05:37:44,960
Y'all dónde?

6469
05:37:45,380 --> 05:37:45,560
Yeah.

6470
05:37:47,160 --> 05:37:49,020
Good, then let's get down to business.

6471
05:37:49,020 --> 05:37:49,060
Okay.

6472
05:37:49,060 --> 05:37:49,740
We feel better now.

6473
05:37:49,940 --> 05:37:53,460
Y'see Snake, people are just sacks of shit, and they're full of holes.

6474
05:37:53,760 --> 05:37:56,240
Fill them up with water and it's gotta come out from side to side.

6475
05:37:56,880 --> 05:37:58,880
Okay, maybe that was a bad example.

6476
05:37:59,100 --> 05:38:03,880
What I'm trying to say is, no matter what the situation, there's always a way out.

6477
05:38:04,620 --> 05:38:05,940
Don't throw in the towel yet.

6478
05:38:06,200 --> 05:38:07,080
Clear your mind.

6479
05:38:07,320 --> 05:38:08,040
Think it through.

6480
05:38:08,580 --> 05:38:09,620
Assess the situation.

6481
05:38:10,100 --> 05:38:11,320
You'll find a way to escape.

6482
05:38:12,060 --> 05:38:13,260
Sick and so silly.

6483
05:38:16,080 --> 05:38:17,440
Sick and so silly.

6484
05:38:17,660 --> 05:38:18,820
Can we even reach Eva?

6485
05:38:18,960 --> 05:38:19,460
I don't think so.

6486
05:38:20,420 --> 05:38:21,200
Oh, we can!

6487
05:38:21,420 --> 05:38:24,560
Eva, do they drug the prisoners here with hallucinogens?

6488
05:38:24,560 --> 05:38:26,700
I don't think that's their style.

6489
05:38:26,880 --> 05:38:27,040
Why?

6490
05:38:27,440 --> 05:38:29,180
I had a pretty bad dream.

6491
05:38:29,420 --> 05:38:29,940
Aw, baby.

6492
05:38:30,220 --> 05:38:31,540
A little baby bad dream.

6493
05:38:31,540 --> 05:38:34,900
This monster that I'd never seen before was coming at me with a knife.

6494
05:38:35,280 --> 05:38:36,380
And I wasn't me.

6495
05:38:36,440 --> 05:38:37,640
I was something else.

6496
05:38:38,060 --> 05:38:39,380
That doesn't surprise me.

6497
05:38:39,620 --> 05:38:43,480
You're in a mild state of shock from all the pain and exhaustion you're going through.

6498
05:38:44,660 --> 05:38:46,340
When he says it like, I had a dream.

6499
05:38:46,340 --> 05:38:47,920
Maybe one day you'll learn to stop hiding yourself.

6500
05:38:48,460 --> 05:38:49,380
Sounds so sad.

6501
05:38:49,880 --> 05:38:51,500
I know how you feel, Snake.

6502
05:38:51,780 --> 05:38:52,000
What?

6503
05:38:52,300 --> 05:38:53,400
I'm a spy too.

6504
05:38:53,640 --> 05:38:53,800
Wait!

6505
05:38:54,560 --> 05:38:55,200
You realize it.

6506
05:38:55,220 --> 05:38:55,580
I mean...

6507
05:38:55,580 --> 05:38:58,200
But the fake you is eating away at the real you.

6508
05:38:58,380 --> 05:38:59,460
I'm not a spy.

6509
05:38:59,860 --> 05:39:03,240
The person you're pretending to be is becoming the person you are.

6510
05:39:03,700 --> 05:39:07,140
And the real you is screaming out from somewhere deep inside.

6511
05:39:07,220 --> 05:39:07,980
Eva is projecting?

6512
05:39:08,340 --> 05:39:09,820
That's what you saw in your dream.

6513
05:39:10,240 --> 05:39:10,960
Maybe so.

6514
05:39:11,680 --> 05:39:16,500
I'd sing you a lullaby or something, but unfortunately I don't know any.

6515
05:39:17,600 --> 05:39:20,980
So pick your favorite song and I'll sing it for you in your head.

6516
05:39:21,280 --> 05:39:22,060
Any song?

6517
05:39:22,360 --> 05:39:23,040
Any song?

6518
05:39:23,040 --> 05:39:25,480
And you can have as many encores as you want.

6519
05:39:25,840 --> 05:39:26,700
Sounds fun.

6520
05:39:28,320 --> 05:39:29,300
It's a deal then.

6521
05:39:29,580 --> 05:39:31,600
I wish Snake would tell us his favorite song.

6522
05:39:32,180 --> 05:39:32,960
Good luck.

6523
05:39:33,600 --> 05:39:34,020
Thanks.

6524
05:39:34,740 --> 05:39:35,580
See that?

6525
05:39:36,040 --> 05:39:37,120
It's right now.

6526
05:39:37,280 --> 05:39:40,340
Snake is just laying in the bed all relaxed and you hear...

6527
05:39:40,340 --> 05:39:41,220
Beep, beep, beep.

6528
05:39:41,420 --> 05:39:42,440
Beep, beep, beep.

6529
05:39:43,340 --> 05:39:44,460
Beep, beep, beep.

6530
05:39:44,600 --> 05:39:45,620
Beep, beep, beep.

6531
05:39:46,060 --> 05:39:46,500
Beep, beep, beep.

6532
05:39:46,500 --> 05:39:47,560
Beep, beep, beep.

6533
05:39:47,820 --> 05:39:48,680
Beep, beep, beep.

6534
05:39:48,720 --> 05:39:49,140
Beep, beep, beep.

6535
05:39:49,140 --> 05:39:49,760
So horrible.

6536
05:39:52,200 --> 05:39:52,980
That's a nightmare.

6537
05:39:52,980 --> 05:39:53,020
That's a nightmare.

6538
05:39:54,820 --> 05:39:55,720
Time to eat.

6539
05:39:55,840 --> 05:39:56,660
Time to eat.

6540
05:39:57,280 --> 05:39:58,060
I don't want it.

6541
05:40:00,560 --> 05:40:02,100
How do I throw it through the hole?

6542
05:40:02,280 --> 05:40:03,780
Why am I so bad at getting it through the hole?

6543
05:40:09,200 --> 05:40:09,980
Oh my god!

6544
05:40:14,140 --> 05:40:14,500
FPS?

6545
05:40:14,980 --> 05:40:15,340
Okay.

6546
05:40:22,830 --> 05:40:23,190
Oh.

6547
05:40:23,450 --> 05:40:24,610
I threw it pretty far.

6548
05:40:27,970 --> 05:40:29,490
I'm gonna use my fork and clank.

6549
05:40:29,510 --> 05:40:30,590
Clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank.

6550
05:40:31,070 --> 05:40:31,690
Bless you.

6551
05:40:32,030 --> 05:40:34,050
Clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank.

6552
05:40:34,770 --> 05:40:35,670
My food's over there.

6553
05:40:45,970 --> 05:40:46,690
Uh oh.

6554
05:40:51,210 --> 05:40:53,250
How do I get the cutscene with him again?

6555
05:41:02,160 --> 05:41:03,440
I have to feed him some more?

6556
05:41:03,600 --> 05:41:03,760
Okay.

6557
05:41:08,170 --> 05:41:08,970
Reject three times.

6558
05:41:09,150 --> 05:41:09,470
Okay.

6559
05:41:09,490 --> 05:41:09,610
Okay.

6560
05:41:11,190 --> 05:41:11,930
That's what I thought.

6561
05:41:12,090 --> 05:41:12,930
I just couldn't remember.

6562
05:41:14,270 --> 05:41:15,290
I'm so hungry.

6563
05:41:17,110 --> 05:41:18,710
In game and in IRL.

6564
05:41:20,990 --> 05:41:21,790
Oh, snake.

6565
05:41:22,290 --> 05:41:23,930
You look so beat up.

6566
05:41:23,930 --> 05:41:24,790
You look so bad.

6567
05:41:24,970 --> 05:41:25,730
Are you okay?

6568
05:41:26,170 --> 05:41:27,790
It looks like you're wearing a little bow tie.

6569
05:41:29,310 --> 05:41:29,830
Oh yeah.

6570
05:41:29,870 --> 05:41:30,330
My dream?

6571
05:41:30,530 --> 05:41:31,330
Oh my gosh.

6572
05:41:31,370 --> 05:41:32,750
You guys, my dream was like serious.

6573
05:41:32,810 --> 05:41:33,150
Okay.

6574
05:41:33,650 --> 05:41:35,130
It's like, it was like really bad.

6575
05:41:35,210 --> 05:41:36,110
So I wasn't me.

6576
05:41:36,490 --> 05:41:38,890
And my mom wasn't my mom.

6577
05:41:39,050 --> 05:41:39,470
But I was like, I'm gonna do this.

6578
05:41:39,490 --> 05:41:43,570
But like, it felt like I was having like, like an out of, not an out of body.

6579
05:41:43,630 --> 05:41:47,370
It felt like I possessed like a, like someone or something.

6580
05:41:47,490 --> 05:41:51,090
I felt, and like, I wanted to do something.

6581
05:41:51,350 --> 05:41:56,590
And you know, like my, my, oops.

6582
05:41:57,870 --> 05:42:01,150
My mom was like, no, you can't do that.

6583
05:42:01,730 --> 05:42:05,570
And I was like, I'm gonna do it.

6584
05:42:05,650 --> 05:42:06,730
I'm gonna do it.

6585
05:42:06,750 --> 05:42:09,010
And my mom, who's not my actual mom.

6586
05:42:09,010 --> 05:42:10,170
And I'm not actually me.

6587
05:42:10,330 --> 05:42:12,450
They were like, she was like, you're gonna do it.

6588
05:42:12,510 --> 05:42:12,970
I was like, no.

6589
05:42:13,570 --> 05:42:17,470
And I like, oh hell yeah, frog.

6590
05:42:18,250 --> 05:42:21,370
I ended up like, this is gonna sound so horrible.

6591
05:42:21,570 --> 05:42:23,090
I ended up murdering her.

6592
05:42:25,370 --> 05:42:27,970
Like, and I remember it was like in the bathroom.

6593
05:42:28,070 --> 05:42:32,670
And like, it was like the, like the glass shower door broke and everything.

6594
05:42:33,230 --> 05:42:33,930
I know.

6595
05:42:33,990 --> 05:42:34,970
It's so scary.

6596
05:42:35,330 --> 05:42:35,790
Right?

6597
05:42:36,150 --> 05:42:38,870
And then, and then the rest of the dream.

6598
05:42:39,010 --> 05:42:43,790
Was me like, being like, oh my gosh, I killed my mom.

6599
05:42:44,310 --> 05:42:47,370
And like, people being like, oh my gosh, she's dead.

6600
05:42:47,430 --> 05:42:48,910
We have to figure out who the murderer is.

6601
05:42:49,070 --> 05:42:50,750
And I'm like, oh my God, I'm going to jail forever.

6602
05:42:51,110 --> 05:42:52,290
That thing I wanted to do.

6603
05:42:52,550 --> 05:42:54,990
Well, I guess I'm never gonna do it because I'm going to jail forever.

6604
05:42:56,410 --> 05:42:57,850
And I woke up and I was so scared.

6605
05:42:57,970 --> 05:42:59,550
I thought it was a real thing that happened.

6606
05:43:02,350 --> 05:43:03,050
I was like, why?

6607
05:43:03,350 --> 05:43:04,030
What's going on?

6608
05:43:04,410 --> 05:43:05,170
I was so scared.

6609
05:43:05,210 --> 05:43:06,770
I felt like I possessed someone, someone else.

6610
05:43:07,250 --> 05:43:08,850
I was seeing it through their vision.

6611
05:43:13,140 --> 05:43:14,220
It was so scary.

6612
05:43:16,200 --> 05:43:17,300
Oh my God, can you imagine?

6613
05:43:17,460 --> 05:43:18,200
I tell you this.

6614
05:43:18,480 --> 05:43:20,100
And I'm like, it'll never happen, obviously.

6615
05:43:20,880 --> 05:43:26,620
And then, like, you know, like five years, you see me in the news, mint phantom.

6616
05:43:27,700 --> 05:43:28,100
Murderer.

6617
05:43:32,360 --> 05:43:33,160
Oh, way.

6618
05:43:33,340 --> 05:43:34,740
He gave me a fish, though.

6619
05:43:35,460 --> 05:43:36,700
Big-Eyed Trevally.

6620
05:43:38,100 --> 05:43:38,680
Oh, oops.

6621
05:43:46,140 --> 05:43:46,700
Huh?

6622
05:43:47,000 --> 05:43:47,500
Hmm?

6623
05:43:49,180 --> 05:43:57,140
Well, streaming from Prison, here we go.

6624
05:44:07,940 --> 05:44:09,420
New stream idea.

6625
05:44:09,540 --> 05:44:10,360
Becoming a murderer.

6626
05:44:11,580 --> 05:44:15,640
Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all I guess.

6627
05:44:16,940 --> 05:44:18,600
Not all Americans are dogs.

6628
05:44:19,020 --> 05:44:19,940
You mean it?

6629
05:44:20,240 --> 05:44:21,220
You mean it?

6630
05:44:21,240 --> 05:44:21,520
Yeah.

6631
05:44:21,560 --> 05:44:22,120
You wanna Kiss?

6632
05:44:23,340 --> 05:44:24,100
You know?

6633
05:44:24,100 --> 05:44:28,360
You know, before the war started, I used to live in America.

6634
05:44:29,540 --> 05:44:31,960
I even had a wife and a kid.

6635
05:44:32,160 --> 05:44:33,020
Yeah, I was your kid.

6636
05:44:33,480 --> 05:44:34,680
You must be pretty lonely.

6637
05:44:35,000 --> 05:44:36,560
Oh, Snake, what are you?

6638
05:44:36,600 --> 05:44:37,020
What are you?

6639
05:44:37,140 --> 05:44:37,940
Yeah, I am pretty lonely.

6640
05:44:38,380 --> 05:44:39,220
Really lonely.

6641
05:44:39,320 --> 05:44:40,040
I can fix that.

6642
05:44:40,240 --> 05:44:41,000
What's your kid's name?

6643
05:44:43,840 --> 05:44:44,280
Johnny!

6644
05:44:45,220 --> 05:44:46,720
Johnny, nice ring to it.

6645
05:44:48,060 --> 05:44:48,500
Really?

6646
05:44:49,320 --> 05:44:50,220
You like it?

6647
05:44:50,220 --> 05:44:50,580
Russian Johnny.

6648
05:44:51,040 --> 05:44:53,080
Well if you say so, I'll believe you.

6649
05:44:53,080 --> 05:44:54,080
You seem lonely.

6650
05:44:54,880 --> 05:44:56,960
Actually, my name is Johnny too.

6651
05:44:58,680 --> 05:44:59,200
Johnny!

6652
05:45:00,640 --> 05:45:02,280
Oh my gosh, your wife looks normal.

6653
05:45:02,320 --> 05:45:02,340
Kind of.

6654
05:45:02,340 --> 05:45:04,280
All the first born sons in my family are called Johnny.

6655
05:45:04,380 --> 05:45:06,080
Johnny looks so handsome in this picture.

6656
05:45:06,480 --> 05:45:10,600
My dad's a Johnny and my son's son will probably be a Johnny too.

6657
05:45:10,860 --> 05:45:15,100
144.75 The whole clan of Johnnies.

6658
05:45:18,100 --> 05:45:20,460
Why do we have a cold war anyway?

6659
05:45:20,480 --> 05:45:21,800
The whole clan of Johnnies.

6660
05:45:24,660 --> 05:45:27,640
Our two countries used to be such good friends.

6661
05:45:28,300 --> 05:45:28,760
Right.

6662
05:45:29,300 --> 05:45:30,160
Yeah, I hear ya.

6663
05:45:32,200 --> 05:45:34,400
I just want to see my family again.

6664
05:45:35,100 --> 05:45:36,060
No, Johnny.

6665
05:45:37,840 --> 05:45:38,800
Must be rough.

6666
05:45:39,020 --> 05:45:39,880
Too bad he's not a Mike.

6667
05:45:41,340 --> 05:45:43,240
Not as rough as you have it though.

6668
05:45:48,660 --> 05:45:49,120
Here.

6669
05:45:49,620 --> 05:45:50,180
What's that?

6670
05:45:50,820 --> 05:45:54,360
I filched them from your equipment when the Colonel wasn't looking.

6671
05:45:54,360 --> 05:45:56,380
You stole my stuff?

6672
05:45:58,440 --> 05:45:59,920
Oh, thank you for the...

6673
05:45:59,920 --> 05:46:02,000
It's the least I can do.

6674
05:46:02,820 --> 05:46:05,540
Are those the ones that knock you out?

6675
05:46:08,420 --> 05:46:08,900
Hey.

6676
05:46:09,840 --> 05:46:10,840
Come here, buddy.

6677
05:46:13,020 --> 05:46:14,680
Don't suppose you could let me out of here?

6678
05:46:15,340 --> 05:46:15,620
Huh?

6679
05:46:15,940 --> 05:46:17,220
I can't do that.

6680
05:46:17,440 --> 05:46:18,580
I can't do that.

6681
05:46:20,420 --> 05:46:22,680
Hey, don't you go getting any funny ideas.

6682
05:46:22,920 --> 05:46:24,180
This guy was definitely bullied.

6683
05:46:24,180 --> 05:46:27,100
If you try to escape, I'll have to shoot you.

6684
05:46:27,280 --> 05:46:27,440
No.

6685
05:46:28,580 --> 05:46:29,020
Okay.

6686
05:46:29,120 --> 05:46:29,340
Okay.

6687
05:46:29,400 --> 05:46:29,720
Okay.

6688
05:46:30,540 --> 05:46:31,720
I've said too much.

6689
05:46:31,820 --> 05:46:32,160
Okay.

6690
05:46:32,520 --> 05:46:32,780
Okay.

6691
05:46:32,780 --> 05:46:33,560
I gotta go.

6692
05:46:34,140 --> 05:46:34,580
Raiders?

6693
05:46:34,700 --> 05:46:35,860
Oh, I didn't say thank you.

6694
05:46:36,080 --> 05:46:36,460
Hello.

6695
05:46:36,660 --> 05:46:36,980
Hello.

6696
05:46:37,820 --> 05:46:38,680
Who raided?

6697
05:46:38,760 --> 05:46:39,980
Thank you so much for the raid.

6698
05:46:40,900 --> 05:46:41,620
Hello, everybody.

6699
05:46:41,720 --> 05:46:42,520
I'm MintPhantom.

6700
05:46:42,680 --> 05:46:45,400
I'm a custom-made VTuber.

6701
05:46:45,920 --> 05:46:46,920
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

6702
05:46:48,140 --> 05:46:51,620
We're playing my favorite game series of all time ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.

6703
05:46:52,380 --> 05:46:53,600
Metal Gear Solid.

6704
05:46:54,080 --> 05:46:54,700
We're on...

6705
05:46:54,700 --> 05:46:56,800
This is the third game, but it's the first in the timeline.

6706
05:46:58,360 --> 05:46:59,360
So, you know.

6707
05:47:01,600 --> 05:47:02,740
Let's eat up real quick.

6708
05:47:03,500 --> 05:47:04,960
We got a rat here to eat.

6709
05:47:06,040 --> 05:47:07,300
Don't watch me eat this rat.

6710
05:47:07,700 --> 05:47:07,840
Oh.

6711
05:47:10,140 --> 05:47:10,540
Tasty.

6712
05:47:12,400 --> 05:47:12,800
Murphy!

6713
05:47:13,520 --> 05:47:14,640
Thanks for the time gifted.

6714
05:47:15,280 --> 05:47:15,840
Oh, wait.

6715
05:47:18,600 --> 05:47:19,000
Oh.

6716
05:47:19,380 --> 05:47:20,040
Hold on.

6717
05:47:20,100 --> 05:47:20,580
This way.

6718
05:47:22,880 --> 05:47:23,580
Can I use it?

6719
05:47:23,580 --> 05:47:24,120
Use it.

6720
05:47:24,940 --> 05:47:25,720
Snake, use it.

6721
05:47:26,180 --> 05:47:26,600
Snake.

6722
05:47:28,740 --> 05:47:29,320
There we go.

6723
05:47:31,620 --> 05:47:32,040
Yeah!

6724
05:47:32,660 --> 05:47:33,080
Okay.

6725
05:47:35,760 --> 05:47:37,160
One forty-four.

6726
05:47:40,340 --> 05:47:41,140
That's seven five.

6727
05:47:44,700 --> 05:47:45,760
It was seven five, right?

6728
05:47:49,640 --> 05:47:50,060
Yippee!

6729
05:47:51,480 --> 05:47:52,780
I didn't kill him by the way.

6730
05:47:54,080 --> 05:47:55,040
I knocked him out.

6731
05:47:59,630 --> 05:48:00,470
Who's calling me?

6732
05:48:00,550 --> 05:48:02,730
Sir Streak, thanks for the thank you food!

6733
05:48:02,730 --> 05:48:03,290
Did you manage to escape?

6734
05:48:04,010 --> 05:48:04,850
Yeah, I'm out.

6735
05:48:06,090 --> 05:48:06,890
Be careful.

6736
05:48:07,090 --> 05:48:09,110
In your present state, you're practically naked.

6737
05:48:09,270 --> 05:48:09,650
I know.

6738
05:48:09,710 --> 05:48:12,730
You don't have a single decent weapon and you'll never survive in a battle.

6739
05:48:12,810 --> 05:48:13,010
Okay.

6740
05:48:13,510 --> 05:48:14,250
I got my fist.

6741
05:48:14,250 --> 05:48:15,730
Take some time and pull yourself together.

6742
05:48:16,090 --> 05:48:21,830
Eva says she's recovered your equipment, so rendezvous with her as soon as possible to get your gear back.

6743
05:48:21,930 --> 05:48:22,210
Got it.

6744
05:48:23,190 --> 05:48:24,750
As soon as I leave this area, I'll save.

6745
05:48:24,750 --> 05:48:26,590
Use the escape route Eva set up for you.

6746
05:48:26,850 --> 05:48:31,350
Go down into the sewers through the manhole in the northwest section of Groznygrad.

6747
05:48:31,490 --> 05:48:32,470
I know where that is.

6748
05:48:32,650 --> 05:48:35,450
Start out by exiting the holding cells and heading northwest.

6749
05:48:35,910 --> 05:48:36,350
Northwest.

6750
05:48:40,730 --> 05:48:41,630
Goodnight, Johnny.

6751
05:48:44,190 --> 05:48:44,970
Whatcha got here?

6752
05:48:45,830 --> 05:48:46,530
Smoke grenade.

6753
05:48:50,040 --> 05:48:52,380
Sorry, I thought I heard someone else, but it's my own foots...

6754
05:48:52,380 --> 05:48:54,620
My own feet are scaring me.

6755
05:48:56,740 --> 05:48:57,560
Really feel...

6756
05:48:57,560 --> 05:48:58,080
Oh my god!

6757
05:48:58,220 --> 05:48:58,740
Oh my god!

6758
05:48:59,100 --> 05:49:00,540
How did you get up so fast?

6759
05:49:05,720 --> 05:49:06,240
No.

6760
05:49:06,800 --> 05:49:07,520
No, no, no.

6761
05:49:07,880 --> 05:49:09,180
How did you get up so fast?

6762
05:49:09,720 --> 05:49:10,020
Gosh!

6763
05:49:12,060 --> 05:49:12,580
Um...

6764
05:49:13,920 --> 05:49:14,440
Anyway...

6765
05:49:14,440 --> 05:49:16,380
Six spray doesn't last long.

6766
05:49:16,580 --> 05:49:16,940
Oh really?

6767
05:49:17,200 --> 05:49:18,160
I thought it lasted longer.

6768
05:49:24,230 --> 05:49:24,750
Camera.

6769
05:49:25,950 --> 05:49:26,650
Kero-tan.

6770
05:49:28,210 --> 05:49:28,730
Um...

6771
05:49:29,290 --> 05:49:31,230
I leave through...

6772
05:49:35,100 --> 05:49:35,620
Wait.

6773
05:49:35,800 --> 05:49:36,620
Is he up again?

6774
05:49:36,760 --> 05:49:37,060
No.

6775
05:49:39,640 --> 05:49:40,500
Leave through there.

6776
05:49:42,660 --> 05:49:44,140
But let's grab stuff first.

6777
05:49:45,020 --> 05:49:45,120
Oh!

6778
05:49:45,940 --> 05:49:48,340
Oh hell yeah, mariko!

6779
05:49:49,400 --> 05:49:50,460
Oh la la!

6780
05:49:50,740 --> 05:49:52,000
You can't keep Johnny down.

6781
05:49:52,320 --> 05:49:53,800
Viewers are saying goodbye to the streamer.

6782
05:49:53,820 --> 05:49:54,160
Johnny...

6783
05:49:56,720 --> 05:50:01,220
I'm gonna have to keep knocking him out.

6784
05:50:06,630 --> 05:50:07,470
Take a photo?

6785
05:50:14,280 --> 05:50:15,520
I have to be fast.

6786
05:50:16,740 --> 05:50:17,000
Oh.

6787
05:50:17,780 --> 05:50:18,380
Yeah!

6788
05:50:26,340 --> 05:50:26,940
Nice.

6789
05:50:32,740 --> 05:50:34,780
It's taking a really long time to save.

6790
05:50:38,820 --> 05:50:39,420
Nice.

6791
05:50:43,520 --> 05:50:44,120
Um...

6792
05:50:44,960 --> 05:50:46,260
Do you think he's awake yet?

6793
05:50:48,180 --> 05:50:49,220
No, he's still down.

6794
05:50:50,280 --> 05:50:51,020
Thank you!

6795
05:50:51,740 --> 05:50:52,100
Thank you!

6796
05:50:52,400 --> 05:50:53,000
Thank you!

6797
05:50:58,820 --> 05:50:59,180
Um...

6798
05:51:00,480 --> 05:51:01,480
Where haven't I gone?

6799
05:51:01,740 --> 05:51:02,920
I just want to get him down...

6800
05:51:02,920 --> 05:51:04,020
Oh, that door over there, right?

6801
05:51:04,300 --> 05:51:05,160
Oh wait, no, that's right.

6802
05:51:05,820 --> 05:51:06,740
I think I can leave.

6803
05:51:06,900 --> 05:51:07,580
I think I'm good actually.

6804
05:51:07,760 --> 05:51:08,500
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

6805
05:51:09,320 --> 05:51:09,960
We can leave.

6806
05:51:10,160 --> 05:51:10,640
No wait.

6807
05:51:10,780 --> 05:51:11,700
I didn't go in here.

6808
05:51:11,880 --> 05:51:12,340
Just kidding.

6809
05:51:12,460 --> 05:51:13,020
We can leave.

6810
05:51:14,000 --> 05:51:15,100
It's just another bathroom.

6811
05:51:15,700 --> 05:51:16,320
Oh my goodness.

6812
05:51:18,300 --> 05:51:19,020
We are...

6813
05:51:19,520 --> 05:51:19,920
Actually...

6814
05:51:19,920 --> 05:51:21,600
I do want to go in here real quick.

6815
05:51:21,860 --> 05:51:22,700
Because I...

6816
05:51:25,440 --> 05:51:26,760
I saw this stuff under here.

6817
05:51:29,200 --> 05:51:29,600
Okay.

6818
05:51:31,540 --> 05:51:32,060
Torture room?

6819
05:51:32,220 --> 05:51:33,260
Oh, I missed the torture room.

6820
05:51:36,540 --> 05:51:37,240
Where is that?

6821
05:51:39,560 --> 05:51:39,960
Okay.

6822
05:51:40,340 --> 05:51:40,940
In here.

6823
05:51:41,060 --> 05:51:41,880
Oh, that's right, that's right.

6824
05:51:43,640 --> 05:51:44,040
Uh...

6825
05:51:45,160 --> 05:51:46,240
Nastiness is in here?

6826
05:51:47,360 --> 05:51:48,240
So gross.

6827
05:51:56,500 --> 05:51:57,380
Something on the bed.

6828
05:51:57,460 --> 05:51:58,240
It wouldn't let me get...

6829
05:52:00,380 --> 05:52:00,820
Alright!

6830
05:52:02,940 --> 05:52:03,620
Alright, alright.

6831
05:52:13,720 --> 05:52:14,840
Do you want to save?

6832
05:52:15,080 --> 05:52:16,160
Yeah, I want to save.

6833
05:52:16,240 --> 05:52:17,060
So next time...

6834
05:52:17,060 --> 05:52:19,080
We come back, all we do...

6835
05:52:19,080 --> 05:52:19,460
We escape.

6836
05:52:20,300 --> 05:52:20,740
We...

6837
05:52:21,360 --> 05:52:22,660
Go through the jungles once again.

6838
05:52:22,920 --> 05:52:24,300
Oh yeah, there is a little bit more jungle.

6839
05:52:25,020 --> 05:52:27,160
Because we have to go into the cave.

6840
05:52:27,480 --> 05:52:28,280
And find Eva.

6841
05:52:29,600 --> 05:52:30,760
We head back.

6842
05:52:31,360 --> 05:52:31,740
Grozny grad.

6843
05:52:32,340 --> 05:52:32,860
We...

6844
05:52:35,000 --> 05:52:35,520
Destroy...

6845
05:52:35,520 --> 05:52:37,860
We attach some C3s.

6846
05:52:38,680 --> 05:52:39,680
And then...

6847
05:52:39,680 --> 05:52:41,400
We got our big old fights.

6848
05:52:42,060 --> 05:52:43,020
And that's it.

6849
05:52:45,300 --> 05:52:47,140
So we will do that next week.

6850
05:52:51,500 --> 05:52:53,180
You can see how clean your river is.

6851
05:52:53,340 --> 05:52:53,780
Oh yeah!

6852
05:52:54,200 --> 05:52:57,440
Wait, when does the river happen?

6853
05:52:58,640 --> 05:52:59,680
River is...

6854
05:52:59,680 --> 05:53:01,340
When do I get...

6855
05:53:01,360 --> 05:53:02,100
When does that happen?

6856
05:53:02,200 --> 05:53:02,680
I can't remember.

6857
05:53:02,840 --> 05:53:03,460
We will figure it out.

6858
05:53:03,520 --> 05:53:03,920
We will see it.

6859
05:53:04,500 --> 05:53:09,680
Hey snake, have you ever seen my mother was a teenage spider queen from Mars?

6860
05:53:09,960 --> 05:53:10,500
Hell yeah.

6861
05:53:10,640 --> 05:53:12,080
I can't say that I have.

6862
05:53:12,800 --> 05:53:13,580
Neither have I.

6863
05:53:28,660 --> 05:53:31,520
I took a sip expecting her to like talk for more.

6864
05:53:31,700 --> 05:53:32,520
And she is just like...

6865
05:53:33,280 --> 05:53:33,680
Nope.

6866
05:53:33,680 --> 05:53:33,900
Well...

6867
05:53:33,900 --> 05:53:35,540
I want to keep playing.

6868
05:53:37,280 --> 05:53:37,800
But...

6869
05:53:37,800 --> 05:53:39,480
We will save the rest for...

6870
05:53:40,540 --> 05:53:41,640
We will save the rest.

6871
05:53:43,660 --> 05:53:46,180
How do you get more gas spray?

6872
05:53:46,460 --> 05:53:47,520
How do you even like...

6873
05:53:47,520 --> 05:53:48,200
Replenish that?

6874
05:53:48,780 --> 05:53:50,320
Because I have definitely used it before.

6875
05:53:51,360 --> 05:53:51,840
Um...

6876
05:53:52,680 --> 05:53:54,560
I want to play more but...

6877
05:53:54,560 --> 05:53:55,720
We will wait...

6878
05:53:55,720 --> 05:53:58,020
We have just a little bit left.

6879
05:53:58,480 --> 05:54:01,080
And I will finish it next week.

6880
05:54:01,820 --> 05:54:02,600
And... yeah.

6881
05:54:04,040 --> 05:54:05,420
I'm gonna go take that guy down.

6882
05:54:05,980 --> 05:54:06,880
Watch me do it.

6883
05:54:09,220 --> 05:54:09,680
Oh.

6884
05:54:11,440 --> 05:54:12,860
Can I not CQC?

6885
05:54:13,240 --> 05:54:14,400
Can I not flip him?

6886
05:54:14,800 --> 05:54:16,540
Just attack him.

6887
05:54:16,940 --> 05:54:17,400
Just...

6888
05:54:17,400 --> 05:54:19,820
Just attack him.

6889
05:54:20,120 --> 05:54:21,780
Why can't you just do it normally?

6890
05:54:22,240 --> 05:54:23,500
Why can't I CQC?

6891
05:54:25,500 --> 05:54:26,320
That's so funny.

6892
05:54:26,880 --> 05:54:28,560
Kill me, kill me, kill me.

6893
05:54:28,880 --> 05:54:29,920
Kill me, kill me.

6894
05:54:31,200 --> 05:54:32,060
What if I just run?

6895
05:54:35,080 --> 05:54:35,620
What the?

6896
05:54:35,900 --> 05:54:37,540
Oh my god, that guy just came out of a hole.

6897
05:54:37,700 --> 05:54:38,240
Did you see that?

6898
05:54:39,060 --> 05:54:39,860
Where does that go?

6899
05:54:42,080 --> 05:54:43,200
Where did you come from?

6900
05:54:45,380 --> 05:54:47,080
Did you guys see that guy come out of this hole?

6901
05:54:50,460 --> 05:54:51,100
No way.

6902
05:54:53,800 --> 05:54:54,120
No?

6903
05:54:56,340 --> 05:54:56,940
I'm in a hole.

6904
05:54:58,020 --> 05:54:58,340
Idiot.

6905
05:55:04,400 --> 05:55:05,480
Will I look down?

6906
05:55:05,580 --> 05:55:06,440
Oh, hold on.

6907
05:55:08,220 --> 05:55:09,240
How do I use it?

6908
05:55:12,120 --> 05:55:13,240
What the?

6909
05:55:15,000 --> 05:55:15,980
I'm eating him.

6910
05:55:18,160 --> 05:55:19,520
I'm eating this guy.

6911
05:55:19,700 --> 05:55:20,600
Oh my god.

6912
05:55:20,800 --> 05:55:21,680
Oh my god.

6913
05:55:21,720 --> 05:55:23,180
I'm eating this man.

6914
05:55:23,480 --> 05:55:24,560
Oh my god.

6915
05:55:25,220 --> 05:55:26,440
Oh my god.

6916
05:55:26,800 --> 05:55:32,400
Oh my god.

6917
05:55:32,400 --> 05:55:33,980
Oh my god.

6918
05:55:34,080 --> 05:55:34,900
I'm a monster.

6919
05:55:43,230 --> 05:55:44,450
I'm a monster.

6920
05:55:44,770 --> 05:55:45,990
I just ate him alive.

6921
05:55:49,370 --> 05:55:50,690
I'm a monster.

6922
05:55:55,830 --> 05:55:56,990
So funny.

6923
05:55:57,230 --> 05:55:58,930
I could've killed him by a fork.

6924
05:55:59,110 --> 05:55:59,910
Death by a fork.

6925
05:56:00,770 --> 05:56:01,350
What?

6926
05:56:01,390 --> 05:56:02,830
This guy actually goes to another area?

6927
05:56:04,110 --> 05:56:04,950
That's wild.

6928
05:56:09,010 --> 05:56:10,090
How did he...

6929
05:56:10,690 --> 05:56:11,970
Why was he in there?

6930
05:56:12,770 --> 05:56:13,970
Why was he in?

6931
05:56:16,590 --> 05:56:17,770
Why was he in?

6932
05:56:19,570 --> 05:56:20,610
Why was he in?

6933
05:56:20,610 --> 05:56:22,050
In this pipe.

6934
05:56:22,270 --> 05:56:22,550
You know?

6935
05:56:27,560 --> 05:56:28,600
No way.

6936
05:56:28,740 --> 05:56:31,120
This is where Kerotan is.

6937
05:56:32,860 --> 05:56:33,880
That's so funny.

6938
05:56:37,360 --> 05:56:38,440
She's armed to the fork.

6939
05:56:38,500 --> 05:56:39,700
Activated level 1 alarm.

6940
05:56:40,480 --> 05:56:41,460
That's the highest.

6941
05:56:42,520 --> 05:56:42,740
Oh.

6942
05:56:44,100 --> 05:56:45,580
She's a man-eater.

6943
05:56:49,360 --> 05:56:50,240
Man-eater.

6944
05:56:52,240 --> 05:56:53,560
I can't believe I'm still playing.

6945
05:56:53,640 --> 05:56:54,380
I need to stop.

6946
05:56:54,480 --> 05:56:54,860
I need to stop.

6947
05:56:58,480 --> 05:56:59,580
Thank you guys.

6948
05:56:59,780 --> 05:57:02,020
We will have the finale next week.

6949
05:57:02,460 --> 05:57:03,900
I don't know if my heart is ready.

6950
05:57:05,320 --> 05:57:06,360
But we will have that.

6951
05:57:07,420 --> 05:57:08,300
I'm very excited.

6952
05:57:09,860 --> 05:57:11,080
After Snake Eater.

6953
05:57:11,260 --> 05:57:11,680
After Snake Eater.

6954
05:57:12,520 --> 05:57:15,160
I don't think I'll go quite into 4 immediately.

6955
05:57:16,040 --> 05:57:18,040
I think I'll go from 3 to 4 immediately.

6956
05:57:18,220 --> 05:57:19,520
I might take a break.

6957
05:57:19,760 --> 05:57:20,960
Maybe I'll do like...

6958
05:57:21,660 --> 05:57:22,320
I don't know.

6959
05:57:22,360 --> 05:57:23,020
How long is...

6960
05:57:23,020 --> 05:57:25,040
I think I looked it up for like Ghost Babble.

6961
05:57:25,100 --> 05:57:26,940
I might be able to do it in one stream.

6962
05:57:29,960 --> 05:57:30,480
You know.

6963
05:57:30,940 --> 05:57:32,560
Just to get a new game in.

6964
05:57:34,140 --> 05:57:34,500
And...

6965
05:57:35,900 --> 05:57:36,540
I don't know.

6966
05:57:36,580 --> 05:57:38,320
I don't think I'll be playing portable ops.

6967
05:57:38,380 --> 05:57:38,980
I don't know about that.

6968
05:57:38,980 --> 05:57:39,160
But...

6969
05:57:41,760 --> 05:57:42,820
I don't know.

6970
05:57:42,900 --> 05:57:43,280
We'll see.

6971
05:57:45,220 --> 05:57:45,700
But...

6972
05:57:50,880 --> 05:57:52,660
Watch the Poops movie version.

6973
05:57:52,780 --> 05:57:53,180
So true.

6974
05:57:53,880 --> 05:57:56,280
I might do like Ghost Babble.

6975
05:57:56,380 --> 05:57:57,680
I might do Acid.

6976
05:57:58,240 --> 05:58:00,140
Just so I can cross them off my list.

6977
05:58:00,520 --> 05:58:02,680
And have a full completed...

6978
05:58:03,840 --> 05:58:05,140
Full completed game.

6979
05:58:05,500 --> 05:58:06,280
And then...

6980
05:58:06,280 --> 05:58:07,660
I know it's kind of out of order.

6981
05:58:07,760 --> 05:58:09,320
It's kind of random to do them in between.

6982
05:58:11,160 --> 05:58:11,680
But...

6983
05:58:13,100 --> 05:58:15,200
Isn't every stream Ghost Babble?

6984
05:58:15,260 --> 05:58:15,540
Stop!

6985
05:58:16,800 --> 05:58:17,500
Oh yeah!

6986

6987
05:58:20,180 --> 05:58:20,700
So...

6988
05:58:22,560 --> 05:58:23,840
Gotta get all the...

6989
05:58:23,840 --> 05:58:26,460
Gotta get all the rest of the games off my...

6990
05:58:26,780 --> 05:58:28,720
So people can stop bugging me about it.

6991
05:58:28,760 --> 05:58:30,920
And be like, oh well you've never played Ghost Babble before.

6992
05:58:32,380 --> 05:58:32,900
Alright.

6993
05:58:32,980 --> 05:58:34,800
Well you've never played Snake's Revenge before.

6994
05:58:35,280 --> 05:58:35,800

6995
05:58:35,800 --> 05:58:36,100

7000
05:58:39,300 --> 05:58:40,000
I'm getting to them.

7001
05:58:41,020 --> 05:58:41,380
You know, eventually.

7002
05:58:41,620 --> 05:58:43,160
But we'll finish this next week.

7003
05:58:44,400 --> 05:58:46,940
Same day, same time as this week.

7004
05:58:47,380 --> 05:58:48,180
And yeah!

7005
05:58:48,440 --> 05:58:49,240

05:58:58,660 --> 05:59:00,080
I hope you guys had fun.

7010
05:59:00,200 --> 05:59:01,480
What a silly, silly game.

7011
05:59:01,800 --> 05:59:04,340
And I will see you guys next time for the completion.

7012
05:59:04,980 --> 05:59:05,480
And...

7013
05:59:05,480 --> 05:59:07,200
Thank you for more Snake.

7014
05:59:07,200 --> 05:59:09,580
Thank you for five months, Neko.

7015
05:59:11,080 --> 05:59:11,880
Thank you guys!

7016
05:59:12,960 --> 05:59:14,420
I'm gonna go get dinner.

7017
05:59:14,600 --> 05:59:16,840
And if you haven't eaten, I suggest you eat.

7018
05:59:17,260 --> 05:59:17,740
And...

7019
05:59:17,740 --> 05:59:19,000
Get some rest.

7020
05:59:19,680 --> 05:59:20,160
Oh!

7021
05:59:20,460 --> 05:59:22,100
I have to put my desk mat in the laundry.

7022
05:59:23,260 --> 05:59:23,840
Thank you!

7023
05:59:25,940 --> 05:59:26,420
Oh!

7024
05:59:26,440 --> 05:59:28,560
And my schedule for this coming week.

7025
05:59:29,060 --> 05:59:31,160
I'm still waiting on some stuff for the weekend.

7026
05:59:31,380 --> 05:59:32,460
So the weekend will be...

7027
05:59:32,460 --> 05:59:34,620
Friday and Saturday will be a little tentative.

7028
05:59:36,020 --> 05:59:36,500
Um...

7029
05:59:36,500 --> 05:59:37,680
I think I'm not streaming Saturday.

7030
05:59:38,440 --> 05:59:39,340
Thanks for the stream!

7031
05:59:39,460 --> 05:59:39,900
Thank you!

7032
05:59:41,420 --> 05:59:41,900
But...

7033
05:59:42,880 --> 05:59:43,920
Friday I'm not sure.

7034
05:59:44,100 --> 05:59:46,540
It depends on... I don't know when I can stream.

7035
05:59:46,700 --> 05:59:48,900
Because of like, rehearsal and stuff like that.

7036
05:59:49,120 --> 05:59:49,340
And...

7037
05:59:49,940 --> 05:59:52,060
I'm gonna be performing at Vmuse...

7038
05:59:52,060 --> 05:59:53,920
And it's Malaysia so it's like...

7039
05:59:53,920 --> 05:59:55,660
Totally opposite side of the world.

7040
05:59:57,100 --> 05:59:58,180
I'm probably gonna be...

7041
05:59:58,180 --> 06:00:00,340
I have to see what time they do...

7042
06:00:00,860 --> 06:00:02,580
Sound checks and all that stuff.

7043
06:00:03,180 --> 06:00:03,660
So...

7044
06:00:06,040 --> 06:00:11,040
Yeah, it's a bit shorter, it's a bit less streams this week, but I'm taking two days off, sorry.

7045
06:00:11,840 --> 06:00:14,440
But yeah, I will have my schedule up soon.

7046
06:00:15,400 --> 06:00:15,800
Tonight.

7047
06:00:18,100 --> 06:00:20,260
Thank you guys, thank you, thank you, thank you again!

7048
06:00:21,580 --> 06:00:25,140
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, see you next time!

7049
06:00:25,640 --> 06:00:28,300
Bye bye, thank you, thank you, thank you!

7050
06:00:29,640 --> 06:00:30,280
Bye snake!

7051
06:00:30,760 --> 06:00:32,760
Everybody say bye snake, everybody say bye snake.

7052
06:00:33,140 --> 06:00:33,700
Bye bye!

7053
06:00:41,010 --> 06:00:42,390
They can still hear me, oh my gosh.
