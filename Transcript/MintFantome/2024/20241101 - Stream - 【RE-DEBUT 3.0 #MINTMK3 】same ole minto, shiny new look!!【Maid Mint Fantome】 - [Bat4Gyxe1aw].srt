1
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,140
Centuries ago, in a small tucked away kingdom, ruled a royal family.

2
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:55,540
The family was known for rich land, blossoming mint and cocoa bean supplies.

3
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:02,620
The crown prince was set to marry the neighboring and much more powerful kingdom's daughter.

4
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,300
However, there was one open secret throughout the kingdom.

5
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,900
The prince and his maid were... in relations.

6
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Everyone in the palace knew, but kept the information away from the princess, for they knew she could have a temper.

7
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:28,000
Until one night, the princess dropped by without warning and caught the prince.

8
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:38,640
While the princess set the kingdom ablaze in a jealous rampage, the valiant prince stood by his lover and fought for their right to love.

9
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,660
Or so you would think.

10
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:51,300
Instead, the prince buckled under the first sign of trouble and immediately threw his maid away to save his skin.

11
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,940
And while burning at the stake, the maid uttered a curse upon the land and vowed to...

12
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,120
Ugh, I can't believe I'm having to study today of all days.

13
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,500
I really shouldn't have procrastinated this history report.

14
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,860
But when my oshi said she's going to be making a big announcement, I can't miss it.

15
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,220
I'm so excited.

16
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,020
Oh, it could be a new song or a new outfit.

17
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,420
I can't even focus on this book.

18
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,120
I just hope it starts soon.

19
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,340
Ah, oh my god, oh my god!

20
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,500
Oh, Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan, you're so cute!

21
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,100
Uh, is this thing on?

22
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,800
You're so cute!

23
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,820
Good morning!

24
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,840
Marinara and cheese, a perfect blend of meat.

25
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,600
I'm a maid you'll want to wrap around your fork and eat on up.

26
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,760
A meal even a college student can make.

27
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,300
I'm spaghetti-ing it!

28
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,920
Spaghetti-chan!

29
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,500
Everybody, with my lovely group of girls, anything is possible.

30
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,640
But now, it's my turn to follow a different recipe.

31
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,240
And that's why I am announcing my graduation from Hidden Dreamers.

32
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,500
Huh?

33
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,340
Graduation?

34
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,200
No way, no way, no way.

35
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,980
This can't be happening.

36
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,900
Spaghetti-chan, no, no, no, no.

37
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,340
This is just a bad dream.

38
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,420
Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan, Spaghetti-chan.

39
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,320
SPAGHETTI!

40
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,980
My bum.

41
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,320
Huh?

42
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,960
Huh?

43
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's going on?

44
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,980
Oh my god.

45
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,420
Am I dead?

46
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:01,700
Family?

47
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,920
Who was my family?

48
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:03,980
Who am I?

49
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,980
I don't know anything.

50
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,600
I don't even know how to tie my shoes.

51
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,640
Oh god.

52
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,400
Oh god.

53
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,400
What do ghosts even do?

54
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,360
Do I say boo?

55
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,580
Do I say bleh?

56
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,820
Oh god.

57
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,720
What's this?

58
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,820
Get a job.

59
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,420
Excuse me?

60
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,020
Get a job?

61
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,740
Oh my god.

62
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,040
The audacity.

63
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,580
Like, come on.

64
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,220
Can't a girl catch a break here?

65
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,420
I just died.

66
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,860
Like, I know I asked, what do ghosts do?

67
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,220
But like, I didn't mean like, I need an answer right now.

68
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,820
Give me a break.

69
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,680
Come on.

70
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,560
I don't even know.

71
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,100
I don't even know where I am.

72
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,420
I don't even know anything.

73
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,720
What's 2 plus 2?

74
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,340
Who even knows?

75
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,220
Like, this is ridiculous.

76
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,160
Just, can't I just have a moment?

77
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:55,800
Gabe!

78
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,220
Yay!

79
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,940
Thank you!

80
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,380
Yeah, I mean I just got here.

81
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,240
Why not relax a little bit and play a little bit of video games, huh?

82
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,620
Yeah.

83
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,680
And I think I better get out of this weird forest.

84
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,100
I don't know why I'm here.

85
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,040
But I think the computer just set on fire.

86
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,320
So, let's just find the nearest town and set up shop.

87
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,230
Trick or treat.

88
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,890
Um, hello?

89
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:49,990
Hello?

90
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,650
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

91
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,230
Hello?

92
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,530
Excuse me.

93
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,910
Um,

94
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,390
hello?

95
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,330
Yes, uh, it is me.

96
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,670
Could you lower the game real quick?

97
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,770
Yeah, you know, I'm just trying to have a conversation with you and all that fun stuff.

98
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,310
Yep, yep.

99
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,690
Hello?

100
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:10,670
Uh, hello?

101
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,010
Hi.

102
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,070
Yeah, could you put your game down?

103
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,810
You do know you're like paying per hour for this table, right?

104
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,990
Oh my goodness.

105
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,590
But there you guys are.

106
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,750
Okay.

107
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,710
Yeah, hello?

108
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,750
Hi.

109
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,430
Yes, so...

110
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,170
Now that I have your attention.

111
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:35,770
Yes.

112
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,370
I know you have been waiting to see the wizard.

113
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,220
And it is finally your chance to see...

114
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,570
The wizard.

115
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,870
So, yes, um, I hope you are prepared to see the wizard.

116
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,850
And, um, uh, yes.

117
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,190
But before you see the wizard, uh, unfortunately I will have to blindfold you.

118
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,950
The wizard is very private, okay?

119
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,290
Um, the wizard has his ways.

120
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,690
So, um, you know, I'm just gonna have to blindfold you real quick.

121
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,750
I hope that's okay.

122
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,510
And, um, yes, just give me one moment.

123
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,430
One moment, please.

124
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,190
Okay, okay, yeah.

125
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,690
The wizard, yeah, I know you have been waiting very patiently.

126
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,430
The wizard is a very, very busy wizard, okay?

127
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,170
So I know you've been waiting...

128
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,690
I don't know.

129
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,850
I don't actually know how long you've been sitting here.

130
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,690
Um, but the wizard is now available.

131
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,710
So, um, just give me one moment.

132
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,990
Okay, let's blindfold you.

133
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:41,910
Okay.

134
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,490
Okay, um, give me one second.

135
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,150
I'm blind... you're blindfolded, right?

136
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,030
You can't see anything?

137
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:54,910
You can't see anything?

138
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,990
Okay, um, just give me one second.

139
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,830
Uh, you might hear some noises.

140
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,070
You might feel me touching you.

141
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,750
Um, don't freak out or anything, please.

142
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,350
Thank you.

143
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,670
Okay.

144
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,930
Okay, um, just one second.

145
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,650
I'm setting up.

146
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,520
Okay, um, all right.

147
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,440
I believe we're just about done.

148
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,560
Uh, wizard, are you... are you...

149
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:32,300
Oh, gray and powerful wizard, are you prepared to see your next, uh, subject?

150
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,620
What do you call it?

151
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,660
Um, yes!

152
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,920
Okay, the wizard will see you now.

153
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,130
I am the wizard.

154
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:27,290
I know, lost souls, you have come to see me seeking wisdom from my brain and beyond.

155
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,350
It is I, the wizard.

156
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,730
Yes, look upon my orb.

157
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,370
It works very well.

158
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,210
Yes, I am the wizard.

159
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,790
And I know you are a troubled soul.

160
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,750
You've come to the right place, seeking guidance.

161
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,890
Yes, I understand you're wanting maybe answers that...

162
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:10,650
...life can't give you, but the afterlife may have what you seek.

163
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,310
You see my orb?

164
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,870
It is how I talk with the spirits.

165
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,690
And how I make really funny faces when I'm by myself.

166
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,050
Yes!

167
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,350
Yes!

168
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,770
Now...

169
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,660
Wait...

170
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,100
Um, hold on.

171
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:48,660
I must use my third eye, which is also very real, to look into the orb, okay everybody?

172
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,780
Are you ready to...

173
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,540
I don't know, is this a seance?

174
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,380
Um...

175
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,580
You know, my wizarding ways have no...

176
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,760
Okay, hold on, let me turn off this mic.

177
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,620
My wizarding ways have no explanation, okay?

178
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,100
You may feel and experience things that you...

179
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,840
...may have never experienced before.

180
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,280
Yes.

181
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,780
Um, and um...

182
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,620
I know we talked about like the...

183
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,700
...like the upfront fee.

184
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,440
Um, you know, but uh...

185
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,240
Um, anything that happens, there's like a spirit summoning fee per minute.

186
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,900
And um, what else do I have here?

187
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,820
I have a third eye fee.

188
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,700
For how long I have to use my third eye, which is basically the entire time.

189
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,200
And then I have...

190
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,440
You took up...

191
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,680
You took up a seat.

192
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,180
So uh, we have a chair fee.

193
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,620
Okay, we'll just go over it like afterwards.

194
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,860
You know, it's all good, don't worry about it.

195
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,320
What do you require, wizard?

196
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:07,780
Visa?

197
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,520
Mastercard?

198
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,420
Oh, we accept all sorts of payments.

199
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,820
Um, so yeah.

200
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,760
Are you ready...

201
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,540
...to gaze into the beyond?

202
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,420
I must see you say yes.

203
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,880
I must see you say yes.

204
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,480
My body is ready.

205
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,960
Yes, yes, yes!

206
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,240
Um...

207
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,760
I made a connection.

208
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,580
I've made a connection.

209
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,320
Oh, wait.

210
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,320
Wait, something's actually coming.

211
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,940
Wait, something's coming through for real.

212
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,900
This is maybe the first time this has ever happened.

213
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,100
No, this is not the first.

214
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,740
I mean, this is my powers at work!

215
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,080
Now, what is that?

216
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,060
That you see?

217
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,280
This spirit is...

218
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,560
...doing...dancing...something.

219
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,000
What the hell is it doing?

220
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,880
Oh, yes.

221
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,520
These magical powers.

222
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,360
Look how spherical my orb is.

223
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,200
It's kind of impressive, isn't it?

224
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,960
How...how round it is.

225
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,800
The feet...of a spirit!

226
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,740
Have you ever seen a spirit before?

227
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,140
Say no, because you've never seen magic quite like this.

228
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,260
This is real!

229
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,440
These are my real powers of my third eye and my magic hat.

230
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,600
That's from...

231
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,240
...a place called Club Penguin.

232
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,520
And...round.

233
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,360
Whoa.

234
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,840
Whoa.

235
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,480
Oh, good.

236
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,500
This...this spirit has not only just shoes, but also socks.

237
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,080
Good, good.

238
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,400
Good to know.

239
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,800
Oh my goodness.

240
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,520
I have to use the...

241
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,500
It's...the spirit's going kind of crazy.

242
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,460
I have to use my mouth to simulate sound effects.

243
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,600
I don't think the socks are edible.

244
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,420
I don't think so.

245
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,160
Oh my.

246
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,460
We even have a knee.

247
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,440
Oh my gosh.

248
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,900
A knee.

249
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,720
A spiritual knee.

250
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,520
Wow.

251
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,640
You could say even a Nico Nico knee.

252
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,420
Oh my goodness, another knee.

253
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,220
Won't stop you from trying.

254
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,840
You can definitely try.

255
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,700
You can definitely attempt.

256
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,540
Oh yes, indeed.

257
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,900
Oh, oh.

258
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,400
When I dance, the spirit also dances.

259
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,500
How peculiar.

260
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,720
Oh my goodness.

261
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,800
Oh my gosh, dance party.

262
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,190
No way.

263
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,890
Wait.

264
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,570
Oh my goodness.

265
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,070
Whoa.

266
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,890
What the...

267
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,450
That looks unsanitary.

268
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,970
Unsanitary spirit.

269
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,230
Clean up after your food.

270
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,070
How dare you just let it drip all over you.

271
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,530
That's disgusting.

272
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,210
There's just chocolate.

273
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,610
I hope that's chocolate.

274
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,630
There's spiritual ghost chocolate all over this leg.

275
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,210
Now that might be edible.

276
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,130
Not quite sure.

277
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,490
That might be edible.

278
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,270
But what about this?

279
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,650
Wait a second.

280
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,190
I just noticed something.

281
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,930
You know, this spirit is kind of copying my style.

282
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:17,730
Except I have a frilly band and the spirit has a different band.

283
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,650
Okay, copy.

284
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,870
We can't both be wearing the same outfits.

285
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,870
That's so embarrassing.

286
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,450
Somebody has to change.

287
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,090
Somebody has to change, okay?

288
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,190
Okay.

289
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,270
So embarrassing.

290
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,070
For real.

291
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,890
Okay, spirit.

292
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:42,990
What else do you got?

293
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,150
What else do you have here, spirit?

294
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,030
Oh, and also...

295
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,770
Whoa, the thigh is really close.

296
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,150
Don't go licking it now.

297
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,630
But even, you know, ribbons on the back and the such.

298
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,450
The spirit's really giving us a fashion show.

299
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,210
Not close enough.

300
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,350
Yeah, let's...

301
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,430
Even the spirit agrees.

302
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,810
Disgusting behavior.

303
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,050
This is a spirit, guys.

304
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,650
This is no longer living.

305
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,270
You can't simp for a ghost, okay?

306
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,730
Once we know...

307
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:25,630
Once we fully form this ghost's form...

308
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:32,330
We can ask it any question about the universe.

309
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,790
We can ask it anything that we want to know.

310
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:42,930
The spirit is all-powerful and all-knowing because I summon them.

311
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,790
Oh, wait a second.

312
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:47,790
This really is...

313
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:47,890
What?

314
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,690
This ghost is really stealing my style.

315
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:58,290
Except, this also has like a little kind of locket-looking...

316
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,050
I don't even know what to describe that as.

317
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,150
I think the ghost is...

318
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:10,530
Maybe, perhaps, the ghost is familiar with my game and is cosplaying the great and powerful wizard.

319
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,410
That must be the case.

320
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,250
A buckle!

321
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,530
Yeah, a buckle.

322
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,130
Thanks, guys.

323
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,370
It's a buckle, yeah.

324
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,870
Oh, the skirt is so poofy.

325
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,350
Just like mine.

326
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,930
No, we can dance together.

327
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,790
Oh, yeah.

328
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,090
Oh, break it down, ghost.

329
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:29,750
Break it down.

330
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,550
Break it down.

331
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,310
Oh, my god.

332
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,610
Whoa, the ghost is going crazy.

333
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,010
I gotta match their energy.

334
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,490
Oh, my god.

335
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,370
Wow, whoa.

336
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,250
Oh, my goodness.

337
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,670
Who is this?

338
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:46,710
What?

339
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:54,150
Look at this dapper, squishy, mochi-mochi-looking fella.

340
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,290
He's quite cute, wouldn't you say?

341
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,770
Oh, I think the ghost agrees.

342
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,110
Yeah, he kind of looks like my guy, but a little more...

343
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,710
I can't tell.

344
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,310
Sleepy?

345
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,470
Something's...

346
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,550
Something's a little different.

347
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,410
They're like...

348
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,550
They're like brothers.

349
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,890
But this is the chill brother.

350
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,150
And mine's the anxiety brother.

351
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,490
Very squishy.

352
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:19,900
Yeah, very...

353
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,110
Oh, my goodness.

354
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,830
He's like really dancing up in there.

355
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,070
I think he likes the PGM.

356
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,270
The cooler brother.

357
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,850
The cooler brother, truly.

358
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,570
The ghost is continuing to move.

359
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,450
Hey.

360
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,810
Ghost, show us your face.

361
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,230
I command thee.

362
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,950
I command thee, ghost.

363
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,690
So we can know your secrets.

364
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,490
I summoned you here.

365
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,670
And so I will have you...

366
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,330
Say...

367
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,930
I will have you spill the tea.

368
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,630
Not yet ready, I think.

369
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,430
But it seems here we have...

370
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,090
Maybe halfway?

371
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,630
Or I guess more than halfway.

372
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,390
It's half of...

373
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:08,550
It's the waist.

374
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,910
It is the waist.

375
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,750
Hmm.

376
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:14,790
Interesting.

377
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,590
The cute little buttons there, huh?

378
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,550
I wish mine had buttons.

379
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,510
Oh, lucky you, huh?

380
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,350
Lucky you with your buttons.

381
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,610
Oh, okay.

382
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,290
Maybe the wizard will sew some on later.

383
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,070
I don't know.

384
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,490
I'm a very busy wizard, I guess.

385
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,110
I suppose.

386
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,430
What's this too?

387
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,650
Oh, the arms are up.

388
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,190
Why?

389
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,270
Why are...

390
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,790
Oh, my arms are also up.

391
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,830
Why are our arms like that?

392
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,830
Why are our arms like that?

393
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,350
Well, of course, I do it to make the ghosts feel comfortable.

394
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,650
I'm not a ghost, I'm a wizard.

395
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,570
But this is a ghost.

396
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,070
And this is how ghost's arms are.

397
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,140
Except it's really deformed, because it's...

398
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,970
Because it's in a orb.

399
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:05,710
Okay, guys.

400
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,590
My crystal ball is maybe deforming things a little bit.

401
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,130
In fact, I believe it's deforming this part quite a bit.

402
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,350
Wow!

403
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,350
Wow!

404
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,270
Whoa!

405
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,370
Whoa!

406
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,990
Spirit, what are you...

407
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,670
What are you showing off to us?

408
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,150
Oh, my goodness, Spirit.

409
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:31,510
I think things may appear larger in the orb than they appear.

410
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,150
Wait.

411
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,650
Things may...

412
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,030
Hold on.

413
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:42,390
Things in the orb may appear larger than...

414
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,910
Than they are.

415
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,510
I think.

416
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,190
Oh, my goodness.

417
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,410
Yes, things are...

418
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:04,970
I don't know.

419
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:06,770
Things are...

420
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,270
I'm a wizard.

421
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:07,570
I know.

422
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:12,970
Actually, we will know, though, once the ghost shows their face.

423
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:17,070
Now, ghost, show thy face.

424
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,530
Ghost!

425
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,670
Oh, we're close.

426
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,670
I can see the neck and also another buckle around the ribbon.

427
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:26,690
How cute.

428
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,310
Ghost!

429
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,410
No!

430
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,530
I command thee, come back!

431
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:34,950
Ghost!

432
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,350
Uh-oh.

433
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:36,950
Hold on.

434
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,410
You guys need to pay more for my third eye to work better.

435
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,330
Did we summon another ghost?

436
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,350
Perhaps.

437
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,650
Did we summon a different ghost?

438
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,710
What is this?

439
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,190
Hmm.

440
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,490
I'm gazing into my crystal ball.

441
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,850
Oh, it's getting bigger.

442
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,370
It's getting bigger.

443
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,490
Oh, my god.

444
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,790
What is this creature?

445
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,410
What have we summoned?

446
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:24,770
Oh, my goodness.

447
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:30,550
Oh, my god.

448
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,130
It's disgusting.

449
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,790
What is this?

450
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,770
Oh, my god.

451
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,190
Oh, my...

452
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,050
It's bald!

453
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,230
Wait a second.

454
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,930
Every time I talk, it also talks.

455
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,800
Creature.

456
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,040
But it's bald, so it's definitely not me.

457
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,960
It's definitely not me because it's bald.

458
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,420
The creature has hair!

459
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,520
The creature.

460
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,520
This creature is disguising itself as me.

461
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,180
How could this be?

462
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,840
Everything I do, it mimics.

463
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,700
What is going on?

464
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,200
What is happening?

465
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,620
Why did my BGM stop?

466
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,460
Oh,

467
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,920
you guys.

468
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,520
You guys, I don't think this is an ordinary creature.

469
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,340
I think this is my ghost!

470
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,180
Guys, I have a confession.

471
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,580
I'm a hack!

472
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,420
I'm not a real wizard at all!

473
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
This is a hack from Club Penguin!

474
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,420
I'm not a real wizard!

475
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,420
I never wanted this job!

476
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,420
Oh, my god.

477
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,620
I'm gonna leave town.

478
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,580
I'm never gonna show my face again here.

479
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,300
Oh, I think my establishment is about to explode.

480
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,700
I think we...

481
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,800
But, I mean...

482
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,880
I mean, I gotta get out of here!

483
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,570
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

484
00:30:54,910 --> 00:31:00,990
Oh, I forgot to turn the filter off.

485
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,870
It

486
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,290
is I!

487
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:19,390
The great spirit that was trapped inside the orb!

488
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,710
And I have been released!

489
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:23,910
Oh.

490
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,230
I also forgot to turn the filters on.

491
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,870
There we go.

492
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,950
Yes, that wizard was a hack.

493
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,510
And...

494
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,370
Now I'm here...

495
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,010
To...

496
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,250
Be...

497
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,590
The ultimate ghost maid!

498
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,660
This isn't like...

499
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,860
You guys saw the outfit.

500
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,540
So I guess I'll just... Oh gosh, I'm so nervous.

501
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,980
I'm nervous!

502
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,500
Okay, well, I'll...

503
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,360
I'll talk a bit.

504
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,840
And then I'll have some karaoke as my first order of being the great ghost maid.

505
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:32,940
To...

506
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,700
So...

507
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,480
Oh gosh!

508
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,680
Why are you nervous?

509
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,400
I don't know!

510
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,520
It's so new!

511
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,620
Oh my gosh, I'm like...

512
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,940
Because I've been waiting...

513
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,000
Since this was announced, I've been waiting a whole month and now it's finally here.

514
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,680
And it's kind of like one of those things where it's like...

515
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,320
Am I allowed to show this?

516
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,260
Because...

517
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,920
Because for this whole time it's been like...

518
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,200
A quote-unquote secret!

519
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:07,810
Oh gosh!

520
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,010
Okay, I'm gonna rip the band-aid off.

521
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:15,970
I'm gonna rip it.

522
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:16,890
I'm gonna rip it off.

523
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:17,610
I'm gonna rip it off.

524
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,930
Wait, hold on, let me turn my BGM... I just noticed the BGM is a little quiet.

525
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:31,830
Okay.

526
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:32,850
Okay.

527
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,170
Because I have things I gotta talk about before the karaoke.

528
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,190
So...

529
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:38,670
Okay.

530
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,410
Oh gosh.

531
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,710
I'm playing it cool.

532
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,450
I'm playing it cool, don't worry.

533
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:13,530
Hi.

534
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,290
Oh wait, I just noticed something.

535
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:18,710
Hold on.

536
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,590
Oh no!

537
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,590
Okay, I'll have to fix that later.

538
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:28,050
I accidentally deleted something on my OBS.

539
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,250
So...

540
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,210
Hi!

541
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,870
Stop!

542
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,850
Don't look at me!

543
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,180
Stop!

544
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,020
Oh gosh, I'm so...

545
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,380
I'm so nervous.

546
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:53,980
Oh my god.

547
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,340
Oh gosh, I'm so nervous.

548
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,060
Thank you guys!

549
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,640
Thank you!

550
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,680
Thank you!

551
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,020
Welcome...

552
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,020
To...

553
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,640
The almighty powerful...

554
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,380
Mint!

555
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,220
Here, I'll zoom out a little bit.

556
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,780
So you guys can see a little bit more.

557
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,400
More.

558
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,520
Wait, maybe I should get rid of the desk.

559
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,220
It feels naked.

560
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
Feels naked.

561
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,140
Hello, hello.

562
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,580
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

563
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,320
Hello, hello.

564
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,720
So, welcome to my...

565
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,400
My third and final...

566
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,120
And I guess I should show you guys some things.

567
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,040
Hold on, let me zoom in here.

568
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,220
Suddenly zoom.

569
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,200
Suddenly zoom.

570
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,300
Yeah.

571
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,000
I don't know what to do.

572
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,800
I don't know what to say.

573
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Honestly, I didn't even plan up to now, so...

574
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,240
I didn't even plan up to here.

575
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,740
The smug is strong.

576
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,060
I know, I can be so smug.

577
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:45,000
But I guess I can show you some of my other expressions.

578
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,820
Oh my gosh, wait, I'm doing the Vtuber thing!

579
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Oh my gosh, I'm doing the Vtuber thing!

580
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,180
Okay, okay.

581
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,920
Okay, okay.

582
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,660
So...

583
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,020
Did I include this?

584
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,360
Hold on.

585
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,280
I forgot something.

586
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,060
But that's okay.

587
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,180
I'll include it...

588
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,040
When I get to there.

589
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,250
Yeah, because there's some stuff that...

590
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,500
We didn't have time to finish before the debut.

591
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,680
So they'll be coming a little bit later.

592
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,260
Yeah.

593
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,660
So...

594
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,260
The pointy ears are new.

595
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,500
Oh my gosh.

596
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,760
You guys are kind of insane.

597
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,840
Because I was like, you know what?

598
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,660
Yeah, I'm a ghost.

599
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,420
I can have pointy ears if I want.

600
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,920
And then suddenly, all this fanart of me with pointy ears started happening.

601
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,420
And I was like...

602
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,480
What did I leak?

603
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,580
I was like...

604
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,480
How did you guys...

605
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,980
How did you guys know?

606
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,860
I can't have any secrets!

607
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,360
It's so unfair!

608
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,800
Are you guys me?

609
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:12,400
Maybe when I possessed you guys, some of my thoughts went into your...

610
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:27,320
So I have some expressions that I'll show you and stuff.

611
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,820
So...

612
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,120
Okay.

613
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,760
Some I want to save for later.

614
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,320
So I'll show you guys just kind of...

615
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,040
So I can also have my arms down.

616
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,920
Oh yeah, here's me.

617
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,780
Hello!

618
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,540
Hello, hello.

619
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,980
Can I take your order?

620
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
Hello, hello.

621
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,140
Hello, hello.

622
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,280
Can I take your order?

623
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,680
Or I can have them up, of course.

624
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,920
This is more natural for me, honestly.

625
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,540
Hands real.

626
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,040
So...

627
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:22,180
And don't leave because after I show you all this stuff, we'll do the karaoke and I have some special guests.

628
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,400
So...

629
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,820
If you want to watch the karaoke and stuff...

630
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,200
I know that's like people leave once the reveal happens.

631
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,840
But...

632
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,440
Show the hands.

633
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,480
Let's see my hands.

634
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,820
You can see it without the orb.

635
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,340
My skirt is so flowy.

636
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,760
It's very ghosty.

637
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,260
Because I'm a ghost.

638
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:52,820
Oh!

639
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,340
One of my favorite things though.

640
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:54,960
Look at this.

641
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,340
Look at the sparkles on my...

642
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
On the little buckle.

643
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,260
Isn't it so cute?

644
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,920
Little sparkles on the buckle.

645
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:15,800
Okay.

646
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,080
So, I can...

647
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,830
I can...

648
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,660
Yeah!

649
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,020
Yeah!

650
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,220
Yeah!

651
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:46,740
Oh my gosh.

652
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,300
I don't...

653
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,700
How do Vtubers do this?

654
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,720
I'm scared.

655
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,700
And...

656
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,500
Let's see.

657
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,860
I can also...

658
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,460
Someone said smug earlier, huh?

659
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,220
Well...

660
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,300
Uh-huh.

661
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:11,740
Okay.

662
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,740
Okay.

663
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,420
I'm freak phantom.

664
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,680
I've literally have seen your tweets.

665
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,740
Seen your tweets.

666
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,760
Unfortunately.

667
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah, caught in 4K.

668
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,220
Lude woman!

669
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:40,960
Me?

670
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,260
You!

671
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,840
Not me!

672
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,560
This is me side-eyeing you.

673
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,090
So...

674
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,510
Yeah, I can be extra smug now.

675
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,030
And...

676
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:12,430
For when I'm always panic mode.

677
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:13,730
Which is...

678
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:14,790
No!

679
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,530
This one I had before too.

680
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,240
I always feel very panicked.

681
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:30,980
So...

682
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,020
Yes.

683
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:37,780
Yeah.

684
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,760
This is literally me.

685
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,800
Right now, at this very moment.

686
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:45,980
And...

687
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,680
I have...

688
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,220
I have...

689
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,340
I think some of you guys like this kind of expression.

690
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,460
And then if I do this too...

691
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,400
Now I'm extra disappointed.

692
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:10,100
All my spiritual energy has been drained from my ectoplasm body.

693
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,280
I'm taking emotional damage.

694
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,020
Literally at this very moment.

695
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,760
Oh, it hurts.

696
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,710
Yeah.

697
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,170
And...

698
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:36,850
Let's see.

699
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,790
I can...

700
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,490
Oh, this one's kind of fun.

701
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,510
So this is when you guys are waiting for my stream to start.

702
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:46,890
Hold!

703
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,610
Hold!

704
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,170
Hold!

705
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,930
Is she gonna start on time?

706
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,970
Is she gonna start?

707
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:03,710
Oh my god.

708
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:04,810
We have...

709
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,970
We have just one minute left.

710
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,870
And the VTuber's not here?

711
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:11,790
Oh...

712
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,300
Why did my tongue come out?

713
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,260
But I like to combine it with...

714
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,020
Oh my gosh.

715
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,820
This is the best thing ever!

716
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,940
This is me whenever I play Metal Gear Solid!

717
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,120
No!

718
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,480
Oh my gosh.

719
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,460
Solid Snake!

720
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,400
Blizzcon!

721
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,300
Actually no.

722
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,820
Blizzcon!

723
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,680
You guys, look at my ears.

724
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,380
When I blush.

725
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,620
Oh gosh.

726
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,580
Yeah, my ears get red now.

727
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,100
It's kind of embarrassing.

728
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,140
No!

729
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,860
It's kind of embarrassing though.

730
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,760
Stop looking at my ears.

731
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,200
You freak.

732
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,380
Stop looking at my ears, you freak.

733
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:39,720
Freak.

734
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,920
So yeah, this is my blushy blush blush blush.

735
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,900
Which you'll never receive.

736
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,360
And...

737
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,520
Let's see.

738
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,860
Oh wait.

739
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,500
I want my arms back up.

740
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,140
And...

741
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,700
I have a couple more.

742
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,680
A couple more.

743
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,060
I wanna save a few of them for later maybe.

744
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,300
Let's see.

745
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,500
Oh here.

746
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,800
And then...

747
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,320
You guys!

748
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,560
When you're so mean to me!

749
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,180
Stop being so mean to me!

750
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,150
Bully.

751
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,030
No bully.

752
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:47,810
No bully.

753
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,810
Okay, okay, okay.

754
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:52,770
No bully.

755
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,650
No bully!

756
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:01,810
But of course I can also...

757
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,810
Be sad and...

758
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,710
Sad, but you know, happy sad.

759
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:09,610
I'm like...

760
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,930
That's kind of how I feel like right now.

761
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,170
I just feel very...

762
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,170
Emotional.

763
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,010
Very grateful.

764
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:23,570
Oh my gosh.

765
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:24,570
You guys!

766
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,310
My 3.0!

767
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,730
Finally happened!

768
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,630
And I mostly had no...

769
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,790
Mostly no scuff I think.

770
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:35,510
Maybe.

771
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,210
And then...

772
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:42,930
Oh, of course.

773
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,170
I have...

774
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,750
My tongue.

775
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,150
I can't be a ghost without my tongue.

776
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,010
Yeah.

777
00:47:58,770 --> 00:47:59,730
I can...

778
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,090
Yeah.

779
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,930
So the...

780
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:12,030
The eye and the tongue emote will...

781
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:12,570
Change.

782
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,950
It looks a little...

783
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:19,210
I think it actually looks a lot less like panties.

784
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,450
But I didn't test it...

785
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:22,250
In the...

786
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,490
In the emote thing.

787
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,610
So I guess we'll...

788
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,110
I guess we'll find out.

789
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,110
So now you're probably just like...

790
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:31,890
Oh my gosh.

791
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:36,430
Everything is so new and shiny and...

792
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,930
Who created all this awesome stuff?

793
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:43,950
You had so many things that happened...

794
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:45,190
Today.

795
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:47,550
Right before...

796
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,530
You appeared as you are now.

797
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,690
So I'll go over my credits and then we'll get into the karaoke.

798
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:58,910
I think...

799
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,170
I have time.

800
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:01,850
I think I'll be okay.

801
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:04,910
Wait.

802
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:06,910
I have some other stuff too.

803
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:10,970
This one is kind of interesting because I...

804
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:12,190
Didn't expect it.

805
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:14,310
But this will be for my...

806
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:17,970
Emo song hours during karaoke maybe.

807
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:20,010
Watch my hair.

808
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:26,670
Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you.

809
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,010
My hair grew.

810
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,030
Crazy.

811
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:36,770
Crazy, crazy.

812
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,370
And that also brings me to...

813
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,330
Another hair related thing.

814
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,530
These were not done in time, unfortunately.

815
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,350
But, like I said, it will happen...

816
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,430
Sometime soon-ish, I think.

817
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:58,490
Soon-ish.

818
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:03,070
But I have two hairstyles.

819
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:05,310
Two more hairstyles that...

820
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:10,350
Wait, does that work?

821
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:11,290
Hold on.

822
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:14,770
Okay, there we go.

823
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:20,070
That will be joining me.

824
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:22,530
The first one is...

825
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,340
Twintails!

826
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,540
Oh my gosh!

827
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,260
So kawaii!

828
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,800
Twintails!

829
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,260
Actual, real twintails.

830
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,260
Oh my gosh.

831
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,140
I'm gonna look like a real...

832
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,780
Like a real man.

833
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,780
I mean, I am a real man, but...

834
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,780
And then the next...

835
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,210
Will be...

836
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:07,850
Looks the same so far.

837
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,050
Looks the same so far.

838
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,270
Long hair!

839
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,450
So, sorry that they couldn't be done for today.

840
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:32,370
But, please look forward to them when I can include them.

841
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,590
Whenever that is.

842
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:39,990
I know, it's so long and elegant.

843
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:40,890
Oh my goodness.

844
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:42,370
Oh my gosh.

845
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,310
But for now, you're stuck with me.

846
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,750
For now, you're stuck with plain Jane Minto.

847
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:55,190
Okay, so...

848
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:56,410
Was that everything?

849
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,750
Oh, no, I did have...

850
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,450
Sorry, I forgot some other phrases.

851
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:05,090
I forgot this one.

852
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,770
For when you guys are particularly...

853
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:17,110
When you guys are particularly deserving of jail time, probably.

854
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:29,530
Death penalty!

855
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:34,230
Jail!

856
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:34,770
Jail!

857
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:35,250
Jail!

858
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:35,790
Jail!

859
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,450
Jail!

860
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:36,870
Jail!

861
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:37,270
Jail!

862
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,450
Go to jail!

863
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:39,570
Do not pass go!

864
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:40,750
Do not collect $200!

865
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:42,310
Jail!

866
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:43,030
Jail!

867
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:43,450
Jail!

868
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:43,870
Jail!

869
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:44,410
Jail!

870
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:50,680
Neko Mint.

871
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,480
I can be like a clock.

872
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:04,010
That was weird.

873
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,630
Be good now.

874
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,090
Be good.

875
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,970
Okay, credits time.

876
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,790
Credits, credits, credits.

877
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:21,650
I'm going to scooch up right next to you guys.

878
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:25,030
I'm going to bring my desk back because it's quite lonely without it.

879
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,550
And...

880
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,030
And credits!

881
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,850
Okay, hold on.

882
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:37,790
Pause.

883
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:48,810
First and foremost, I want to do a special thank you to, of course...

884
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:52,810
Ichikamaya for helping finalize my 2.0 design.

885
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,810
Because, you know...

886
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:00,210
Even what I have now, how I look now is with help from Maya.

887
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:06,170
And so, I of course want to...

888
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,770
Thank her, there we go.

889
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:13,930
And of course, to 1.0 and 2.0 Mama Keiichi, our Mama!

890
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:16,150
So, thank you.

891
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:19,410
Thank you so much, Mama Keiichi!

892
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,270
Thank you!

893
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:25,390
So, yeah.

894
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:32,150
Of course, even though I have 2.0 Mama and everything...

895
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:37,090
Of course, I'm so grateful for Mama Keiichi for bringing me to life.

896
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:39,070
Well, after life.

897
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,430
To begin with.

898
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:42,350
So...

899
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:43,850
Thank you!

900
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:46,170
Thank you, thank you!

901
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,070
Yeah, and...

902
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:54,430
For credits for the main stream stuff...

903
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:59,170
Sorry, I meant to say...

904
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,630
See, this is what Maya helped me with.

905
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:04,870
So, up in the top left corner is kind of what I drew.

906
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:10,790
And then, Maya really fleshed it out and helped me with picking a bunch of hairstyles and things like that.

907
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:14,850
So, that's how I became to be in this.

908
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:15,890
Like this.

909
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,230
And look at this, she did all of this.

910
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:22,430
Even the reference sheet that I have now, she did for free and everything.

911
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,170
She's so, so sweet.

912
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:25,490
Thank you, Maya!

913
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:26,990
Thank you!

914
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,170
Thank you!

915
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,030
Yeah, yeah.

916
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:34,730
She had all these little hairstyles drawn out for me and everything.

917
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:36,750
I was like, oh my goodness.

918
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,370
She put so much effort into it.

919
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:40,210
I was really grateful.

920
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,350
All those years ago.

921
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,150
And let's see.

922
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:48,310
Next.

923
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:55,670
Was it obvious?

924
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:01,810
Was it obvious?

925
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:06,890
My mama!

926
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,070
Oh my gosh, I can finally say this.

927
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:11,450
Ayami mama!

928
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,170
Ayami mama is my new mama!

929
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:20,550
Yeah!

930
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,190
And she made me so cute.

931
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,170
What do you guys think?

932
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:31,310
You guys... How are we feeling, huh?

933
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,350
How are we... How are we feeling?

934
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,790
Do you guys like it?

935
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:48,170
Cute?

936
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:48,650
Cute?

937
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:49,510
Yeah?

938
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:50,930
Yeah!

939
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:55,130
Yeah!

940
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,770
Thank you guys for all the superchats and everything, by the way.

941
00:56:58,810 --> 00:56:59,850
I really appreciate it.

942
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,330
Sorry that I haven't been able to really read them and thank you guys.

943
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:07,170
Yeah, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

944
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,370
And then my papa is Celia!

945
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,690
Which... Oh my goodness.

946
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:19,610
Celia is just so cracked and...

947
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:20,950
Thank you, Celia!

948
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:28,170
For making me move and being so attentive to things.

949
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:31,150
Oh my gosh, one of my favorite things about... Look at this.

950
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:32,530
Look at my ribbons.

951
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,970
When I move, they're so puffy.

952
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:36,930
Right?

953
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:39,750
They're so like... They look 3D.

954
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:46,050
I remember when I first sent the picture of me to Matara.

955
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:48,750
She was like, oh, your 3D is getting started?

956
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,150
I was like, girl, no!

957
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:51,530
This is 2D!

958
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:53,090
I'm not 3D yet!

959
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,610
It's crazy, right?

960
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,510
Like they're so... She did such a...

961
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:00,170
And like the little sparkles on the buckle and everything.

962
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:04,130
Oh my gosh, Celia is amazing.

963
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,590
So, so amazing.

964
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:11,470
So, you might recognize...

965
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:18,010
Celia also is Limu's papa and Doki's papa.

966
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:21,510
So now we're all like sisters.

967
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:25,110
Ayami!

968
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,250
I love you with all my...

969
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,130
Ayami papa!

970
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:35,850
I love you!

971
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:39,270
I love you!

972
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:40,270
Thank you!

973
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:45,350
Everybody say hello to Ayami mama.

974
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,190
Why do... Why did you send that?

975
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:49,070
No!

976
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:53,730
I had to fight her to send more money, honestly.

977
00:58:55,670 --> 00:59:00,890
And then Crunchy helped Celia with setting up the project file.

978
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,430
So thank you for that, Crunchy.

979
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,610
And for the opening animation...

980
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,390
Oh my gosh, did you guys see the new opening animation?

981
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:13,010
That's by artist Yodoke on Twitter.

982
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:16,810
It's so cute.

983
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:17,650
Oh my gosh.

984
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:20,370
I kind of like gave them a list of things that I was like...

985
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,650
Oh, maybe you could include this or maybe this.

986
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:24,010
But you don't have to include everything.

987
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:24,490
It's okay.

988
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:26,030
And then they included everything.

989
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,950
And they went all out.

990
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:31,510
I was so happy.

991
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:33,850
When I got it.

992
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:34,430
Show it again?

993
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:35,090
Oh, yeah.

994
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:35,810
Let's show it again.

995
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:36,430
One second.

996
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:36,640
Yeah, so thank you Yodoke.

997
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:41,880
And then the opening music that you heard is by Mitsukiyo-san!

998
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,060
Mitsukiyo-san, thank you!

999
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:47,400
If you don't recognize that name...

1000
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,240
Mitsukiyo-san is one of the main composers...

1001
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,680
for a little mobile game that I like called Blue Archive!

1002
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,680
So, actually...

1003
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:07,620
I'm so grateful now that I went to Anime Expo.

1004
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,680
Because when I was there, one thing I really wanted to do was...

1005
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,420
I was like, I'm going to introduce myself to Mitsukiyo-san.

1006
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,320
Because I want to work with him.

1007
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,880
So I was able to give him my card.

1008
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,880
And then when I was getting this started...

1009
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,220
I was just like, you know what?

1010
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,120
I'm going to shoot my shot.

1011
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:27,380
And see if maybe he'll do my intro music.

1012
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,740
And he said, oh, you know...

1013
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:34,020
I haven't been taking personal, you know...

1014
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,820
Non-corporate requests lately.

1015
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,600
But I got your card at Anime Expo.

1016
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,280
And I liked your style.

1017
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,720
And I saw you're a fan of Blue Archive.

1018
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,500
So I will work with you!

1019
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:48,220
Yeah!

1020
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,960
Because I networked at...

1021
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,720
Because I networked at Anime Expo.

1022
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,080
I got to work with Mitsukiyo-san.

1023
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,660
So, yes.

1024
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,260
And the song is so catchy.

1025
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,340
It's so great.

1026
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,860
And I think it was funny because...

1027
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,720
Some people...

1028
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,860
My last...

1029
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:17,560
My last opening intro video had like...

1030
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,840
Welcome to maid world and stuff like that.

1031
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,720
But the song actually...

1032
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:26,420
Titled by Mitsukiyo-san is Hello Ghost World.

1033
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,620
So we're still ghosting...worlding.

1034
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:30,300
Yeah!

1035
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:34,820
So...

1036
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,140
Yeah.

1037
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,820
We're still technically welcoming...

1038
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,860
Or going to a ghost world.

1039
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:45,120
A world.

1040
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:47,860
Yeah!

1041
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,820
So I was really happy about that.

1042
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,220
And you haven't seen it yet.

1043
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,440
But the ending animation is by Mushroom.

1044
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,180
I really love Mushroom's pixel art.

1045
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,600
So you'll see that at the end of the stream.

1046
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,100
And the BGM that you're hearing now...

1047
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,200
And the ending BGM is by Jun.

1048
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,880
Which, if you watched...

1049
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,940
Mintamatarou's summer special...

1050
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,660
You might recognize that name because he did a lot of editing.

1051
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:14,640
A lot.

1052
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,500
He did all the editing for us.

1053
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,220
So...

1054
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:18,840
Yeah.

1055
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,780
Actually, it's cute because I wanted like a song that...

1056
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:25,940
Tied in with the...

1057
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,100
Like, I wanted two songs that...

1058
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,680
Were the same but not.

1059
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:31,940
So this is like a...

1060
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,880
Kind of like a toned down version of...

1061
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,720
The ending song.

1062
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:36,800
So they're...

1063
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,480
They're like...

1064
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,640
This is like, I called it the Twilight version.

1065
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1066
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,680
And then I feel like I never got to do a proper...

1067
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,120
Like, introduction of...

1068
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,060
The cafe background.

1069
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,100
But it's by Marie.

1070
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:52,580
Which, she also did another background.

1071
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:54,900
A new one that you'll be seeing...

1072
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:55,140
Soon.

1073
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:57,800
In fact, in like a few minutes.

1074
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,400
In like a few minutes.

1075
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,600
Yeah, lower five version.

1076
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:03,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1077
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:04,280
Exactly.

1078
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,110
And then...

1079
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,580
The chat is by Jason.

1080
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:11,960
So thank you.

1081
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,480
Thank you, thank you.

1082
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,540
It's so cute.

1083
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,340
You guys are little ghosties.

1084
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:19,960
Yeah.

1085
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:20,980
Another.

1086
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,780
And then, there's more credits.

1087
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:26,960
Because...

1088
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,660
I had that lore video at the very beginning.

1089
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,860
Thank you, Seven Star Studio.

1090
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:33,420
Thank you, guys.

1091
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,260
Leah, Esper, Azu, Apocay, and Vesson.

1092
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,520
Thank you, everybody.

1093
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:40,280
For working with me on my lore video.

1094
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,200
I kind of like, threw them a script.

1095
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:45,120
And threw them the idea that I wanted.

1096
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:46,320
And...

1097
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:46,940
Oh my gosh.

1098
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,200
The coolest thing was like, they...

1099
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,760
Created that...

1100
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,820
Like, POV.

1101
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,400
And it was like a...

1102
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,520
Real, like, 360 world.

1103
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,520
It was...

1104
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,880
The coolest thing ever.

1105
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,180
I was just like, wow.

1106
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,220
Oh my gosh.

1107
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:01,520
And so...

1108
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,520
Yeah, I was like...

1109
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,460
And then, they brought Spaghetti-chan to life.

1110
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,080
My oshi.

1111
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,940
I hope you guys liked it.

1112
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,500
I came up with the whole script.

1113
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,600
Maybe that...

1114
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,660
For better or for worse, probably.

1115
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:27,600
For better or for worse, probably.

1116
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:35,870
Spaghetti-chan really graduating?

1117
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:36,950
Or was that just a bit?

1118
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:38,690
No, she did graduate.

1119
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:39,910
Yeah, Spaghetti-chan.

1120
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:41,210
She graduated.

1121
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:46,570
Spaghetti-chan!

1122
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:50,970
So sad.

1123
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:53,090
I'm over it.

1124
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:55,730
Kitchen Dreamers.

1125
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:57,130
It's the best...

1126
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:57,950
Idol group...

1127
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,590
Made idol group ever.

1128
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:03,970
Marinara and cheese.

1129
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:05,090
A perfect blend of me.

1130
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:10,970
Rest in spaghetti.

1131
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:13,850
Rest in spaghetti.

1132
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:16,450
And...

1133
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:16,750
So yeah.

1134
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,110
Thank you, Seven Star Studio.

1135
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:19,110
For such a...

1136
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:20,150
Oh, and oh my gosh.

1137
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,030
I didn't ask if I could...

1138
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:24,310
If I could...

1139
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:25,310
Share it...

1140
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:26,650
Before...

1141
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:27,350
So I won't.

1142
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:28,330
But the...

1143
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:29,290
Drawings...

1144
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,090
Like in the...

1145
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:31,510
In the...

1146
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:33,510
Like in the...

1147
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:34,910
Sketch part of the video.

1148
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:36,210
Of the lore video.

1149
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:37,230
Was all like...

1150
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:37,810
Hand done.

1151
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:38,770
And then she...

1152
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:40,070
Like with pencil and stuff.

1153
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:41,470
And then she scanned it.

1154
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:42,470
And so...

1155
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:43,090
It's just...

1156
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:46,090
It was like...

1157
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:47,870
Very authentic.

1158
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:49,270
It's very...

1159
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:49,730
You know.

1160
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:50,930
I was like...

1161
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:52,090
I kind of want like a storybook...

1162
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:53,090
Looking vibe.

1163
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:55,810
Yeah.

1164
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,150
Thank you, Seven Star Studio.

1165
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:58,530
You guys are amazing.

1166
01:06:59,030 --> 01:06:59,670
Thank you.

1167
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:01,350
My...

1168
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,270
I wanted something really...

1169
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:03,310
You know.

1170
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,110
I'm not really like a lore...

1171
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:06,270
Video type person.

1172
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:09,110
I wanted something just kind of...

1173
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:10,450
More silly and goofy...

1174
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:10,910
Than anything.

1175
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:12,730
So...

1176
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:14,150
Hopefully that kind of...

1177
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:14,870
Came across.

1178
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:15,890
Hopefully.

1179
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:19,190
And then last...

1180
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:20,970
Another thing you guys might have seen.

1181
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:23,590
Yes!

1182
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:24,910
Wait.

1183
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:25,250
Hold on.

1184
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:25,890
I actually...

1185
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:26,110
Hold on.

1186
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,010
Let me pause the music.

1187
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:28,910
Because I think I still have it up.

1188
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:34,250
I do still have it up.

1189
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:34,750
I actually...

1190
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,190
We're about to run out of time in the game.

1191
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:40,930
This...

1192
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:41,970
Is the actual game...

1193
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:44,450
That you...

1194
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:46,290
Will be able to play...

1195
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:47,030
After stream!

1196
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:48,490
Yeah!

1197
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:50,890
So...

1198
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:52,690
I basically...

1199
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:53,550
Went to Joji...

1200
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:54,970
And I was just like...

1201
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:55,690
I...

1202
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:58,210
I...

1203
01:07:58,210 --> 01:07:59,350
Okay, there was this one game...

1204
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:01,050
I used to play all the time...

1205
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:01,930
On Cartoon Network.

1206
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:02,710
It was like called...

1207
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:03,690
Trick or Treat...

1208
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:04,590
Beat or something.

1209
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,260
And so...

1210
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:12,880
I really wanted something...

1211
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,560
It always...

1212
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,640
Put me really much...

1213
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,060
Into the Halloween mood.

1214
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,020
And so I really wanted something...

1215
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,000
Just like that.

1216
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,320
And so we came up with...

1217
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,840
With Phantom Freak or Treat!

1218
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,140
Yeah!

1219
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,440
So this will be...

1220
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,140
Available after the stream...

1221
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,100
For you to play.

1222
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,580
The freaking watch...

1223
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,360
I made this.

1224
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:32,440
The little overlay...

1225
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,280
I made it myself.

1226
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:36,660
And...

1227
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:38,260
And...

1228
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:40,560
There's four levels...

1229
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,200
That you can play.

1230
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,920
There's lots of...

1231
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,000
Vtubers in there...

1232
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,200
And lots of Vtuber references.

1233
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,420
I asked...

1234
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:48,420
A bunch of like...

1235
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:49,780
My indie friends...

1236
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:50,660
And people...

1237
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,520
That I was just like...

1238
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,080
Whoever...

1239
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,420
And there's some other corpos...

1240
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:53,980
In there as well.

1241
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:56,340
So...

1242
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1243
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,980
Go and find them all...

1244
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,140
And collect all the treats.

1245
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,400
And at the end...

1246
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,400
There's a Parade!

1247
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:06,920
So...

1248
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:07,900
Yeah.

1249
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:08,580
There's...

1250
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:09,300
I wanted to...

1251
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,740
Honestly include more people...

1252
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:11,980
But...

1253
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:13,660
There was a...

1254
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:14,640
Time...

1255
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,520
Time was not on the side.

1256
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,580
But I tried to include...

1257
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:20,440
A good...

1258
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,220
Amount of people.

1259
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:23,840
And...

1260
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,800
The team was absolutely...

1261
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,300
Crazy.

1262
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:26,600
Oh!

1263
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,320
And all the music is also...

1264
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:28,600
Custom.

1265
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,280
So if anybody wants to stream this...

1266
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,500
Playing it...

1267
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,820
I don't know why...

1268
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:35,000
If you want to...

1269
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,960
I don't know if you want to...

1270
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,300
But...

1271
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,140
You totally can!

1272
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,600
Because the music is...

1273
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,400
All...

1274
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,280
Commissioned from me.

1275
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,140
So...

1276
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:44,880
Or rather...

1277
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,920
I commissioned it...

1278
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,520
For other people.

1279
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:47,820
And...

1280
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:48,700
Yeah.

1281
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:50,280
So...

1282
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:52,860
And...

1283
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:53,780
Oh.

1284
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:54,160
Whoops.

1285
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:56,420
Oh my gosh!

1286
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:57,560
I forgot to credit that!

1287
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:57,820
Wait.

1288
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:58,620
No!

1289
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,320
Guys, I'm so sorry.

1290
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:03,600
No!

1291
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:04,360
Oh my gosh!

1292
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,160
I'm such a failure!

1293
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,080
I forgot to put the music credits...

1294
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:07,940
In the game credits!

1295
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,680
I'm so sorry!

1296
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:10,700
No!

1297
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,140
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

1298
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:14,820
But it's...

1299
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,220
It's on the...

1300
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:16,820
Itch.io.

1301
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,340
So, it's definitely there.

1302
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,220
But, yeah.

1303
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:21,520
Joji...

1304
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,940
Did, like, a lot of the programming.

1305
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:24,780
He had a friend...

1306
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:25,800
Also help, but...

1307
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,360
He doesn't have a Twitter or anything.

1308
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,280
He's just some guy.

1309
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:28,960
So...

1310
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:29,640
Sorry, Escalito.

1311
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,620
You have...

1312
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:30,980
Salary...

1313
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:32,460
Salaryman.

1314
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:33,680
That's your picture.

1315
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,400
And then Lou did the art.

1316
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,540
Electra also helped with the animation.

1317
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:38,900
And...

1318
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,920
Oimo is the illustrator for the parades.

1319
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:43,080
It's a very cute picture.

1320
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,460
I think you guys will like it.

1321
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:45,240
And then...

1322
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,240
For the music...

1323
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,580
This song was done by Fingers.

1324
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,380
Which...

1325
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,660
I feel so awful right now.

1326
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,920
Fingers on Twitter as well.

1327
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:02,420
With a...

1328
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:02,920
With a...

1329
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:03,720
With a one.

1330
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,920
Fingers does a lot of, like, metal gear.

1331
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:09,540
Yeah, Fingers from the Kojima Frequency.

1332
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:11,080
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1333
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,480
So...

1334
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:14,800
He...

1335
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,040
He...

1336
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,160
Created this.

1337
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,520
And it sounds just absolutely exactly what I wanted.

1338
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:24,260
Very, like, old school, you know?

1339
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:25,300
Show their Twitters?

1340
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,020
Oh, you know what?

1341
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:26,760
I can do that.

1342
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:27,660
Hold on.

1343
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:29,540
Hold on.

1344
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,520
I can just do that.

1345
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:31,360
Wait.

1346
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,140
Twitter.

1347
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:33,340
I can go to Twitter.

1348
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,080
Wait.

1349
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:41,820
Oh, no.

1350
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:42,660
I don't wanna look at...

1351
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:43,760
I don't wanna look at...

1352
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,280
There it is.

1353
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:44,520
Okay.

1354
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:47,440
Wait.

1355
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,580
What about this show?

1356
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:49,980
It's probably fine.

1357
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:50,600
Okay.

1358
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,180
Oh, it's really...

1359
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,200
It's really small.

1360
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:56,940
Fingers!

1361
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,380
Fingers on...

1362
01:11:59,380 --> 01:11:59,880
Oh my gosh.

1363
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:00,760
It's really small.

1364
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:01,300
Hold on.

1365
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,160
There you go.

1366
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:08,020
Fingers on Twitter.

1367
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:09,920
Like that.

1368
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,260
And then...

1369
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,900
The other song, which...

1370
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:13,320
Hold on.

1371
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,240
Oh, everything is all messed up now.

1372
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,360
This is so scuffed.

1373
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,340
Hold on, I'm gonna refresh and see what song we get.

1374
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,180
The anticipation.

1375
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,100
It's silent.

1376
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:38,580
Oh, because I didn't click on it.

1377
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,560
Oh, because I didn't click...

1378
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:45,520
My bad.

1379
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,520
This is by Daryl.

1380
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,140
It looks off-centered because it is.

1381
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,040
This is its own thing.

1382
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:03,920
This is its own thing, you guys.

1383
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,500
Hold on, let me get the...

1384
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,300
Let me get Daryl's...

1385
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:11,560
Um...

1386
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:15,380
So...

1387
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,440
Oh, why is it...

1388
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,200
Oh, there we go.

1389
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,400
At Starlight Daryl!

1390
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,180
Thank you, Daryl, for the other BGM, which you might recognize.

1391
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:27,580
Daryl...

1392
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,380
Helped with the...

1393
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:35,240
With my original intro music, so...

1394
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,640
Thank you so much.

1395
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:38,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1396
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:44,370
So yeah!

1397
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,990
That's the game.

1398
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:48,990
Again, it will be available after...

1399
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:52,450
After stream, I still gotta make it public.

1400
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:55,270
So...

1401
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:56,330
Yeah, okay.

1402
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:04,690
I think I...

1403
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:05,970
Are you guys ready for karaoke?

1404
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,350
You guys ready for karaoke?

1405
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,890
And if you find any bugs, just tag me or something, I don't know.

1406
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,750
Put it in the hashtag.

1407
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:17,010
So that I can see and then we'll try and fix it.

1408
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:18,650
Yeah, okay.

1409
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:19,510
Give me a second.

1410
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,350
I'm gonna go back to my loading screen so I can set up, okay?

1411
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:23,870
Give me one second.

1412
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:24,770
Give me one second.

1413
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:14,870
I forgot something.

1414
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:16,030
Hold on.

1415
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,320
Now I'm ready.

1416
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:50,000
Now I'm ready.

1417
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:54,000
Okay, I'm just gonna sing a song...

1418
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,980
To warm up and then I'll bring in my guests, okay?

1419
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:03,080
Wait, I didn't bring up anything first.

1420
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:07,000
I'm not gonna do a lot of songs, I have a karaoke tomorrow.

1421
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,200
So...

1422
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,400
Look at this, you guys!

1423
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,800
We're finally using the stage in my maid cafe!

1424
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,520
Yay!

1425
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:19,660
We can finally use the stage in my maid cafe.

1426
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,100
I can get a little bit bigger.

1427
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,300
Yes, I can get closer.

1428
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,800
Okay, I'm looking down on all of you.

1429
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:30,900
There was a stage?

1430
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:31,320
Yes!

1431
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:33,120
There was always a stage.

1432
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,240
It was in the back corner.

1433
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,280
Of course, every maid cafe is gonna have a stage.

1434
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,000
Well, not everyone.

1435
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:40,460
But...

1436
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:41,740
Most, I suppose.

1437
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:44,420
Yeah.

1438
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,040
Yeah, yeah.

1439
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:47,860
Okay.

1440
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,040
I'm gonna sing something...

1441
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:51,520
Halloween.

1442
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,940
Because I won't sing it tomorrow.

1443
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:58,980
This might be a little weird for the mood.

1444
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,420
Actually, no.

1445
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,120
It's not weird for the mood.

1446
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,440
Oh, wait.

1447
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,800
Well, it's not the Halloween song.

1448
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:08,440
I changed my mind.

1449
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:10,480
Okay.

1450
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:16,980
One second.

1451
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:19,560
One second.

1452
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,260
I don't wanna take too long because...

1453
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:23,100
I...

1454
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,740
I've planned on...

1455
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,360
I didn't want this to be over two hours.

1456
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,400
So...

1457
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:30,660
Okay.

1458
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:31,820
I think this...

1459
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:32,640
Hold on, let me double check.

1460
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,420
I think this is okay.

1461
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:38,900
Okay.

1462
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:39,520
Okay.

1463
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,420
I sing...

1464
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,760
What

1465
01:17:55,800 --> 01:19:07,130
a thrill With darkness and silence through the night What a thrill I'm searching and I'll melt into you What a fear in my heart But here I am You're so supreme I give my life Not for honor But for you In my time There'll be no one else My voice, oh god Crime It's the way I fly to you I'm still in a dream Snake Eater

1466
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:37,870
Someday you'll go through the rain And someday you'll feed on a tree frog This ordeal, the trial, to survive For the day we see new light I give my life, my forerunner,

1467
01:19:44,680 --> 01:20:13,300
my time There'll be no one else Sorry Crime is the way I fly to you I'm still in a dream, snake it all

1468
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:29,140
I'm still in a dream, snake it all

1469
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:37,840
Snake it all Come on now

1470
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:46,100
Come on now You really thought I had like no Metal Gear related toggle?

1471
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:46,700
Really?

1472
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:47,920
At all?

1473
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,480
You thought I had nothing?

1474
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:50,440
At all?

1475
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:57,480
You just like, you were like, oh I guess she just didn't want anything Come on, I have Delvely's eyepatch

1476
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:39,820
That's boss minto to you Yay, Snake Eater Okay, tonight I brought together a group of gorlies that, for most of them Except like one That I have always wanted to sing with I just kind of, for some of them I've been talking with them a little bit more lately And so I know some people might be like,

1477
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:49,500
woah, woah, I didn't even know you talked with that person Yeah, we do sometimes, I don't always talk about who I'm talking with in my DMs

1478
01:21:52,640 --> 01:22:18,580
But yeah, I got stuff going on, I've been reaching out of my comfort zone a little bit And I'm really really grateful because all these lovely ladies were, all of them are so busy And so I am really really grateful that they all took time to join me for this Even though they're just so nice,

1479
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:31,820
some of them were just like, oh my gosh, it's my honor And I'm like, no, it's my honor To sing with you, my voice is really not doing so well today But this is all just for fun

1480
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:49,220
Hopefully I can sing with more people in the future I was just like, oh my gosh, I want to sing with so many people But I also, like I said, I didn't want this to be super duper long So it might kind of be, not a speedrun, but just kind of, let's sing some songs!

1481
01:22:49,600 --> 01:23:05,840
Some duets So I'm going to scoot over And I'm going to introduce the first person, which probably no one is surprised about Oh, wait, hold on

1482
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:23,480
Hi everybody, Matara Comedy Shoujo here, and this is my favorite song in Citadel Space You will not get that reference I don't get that reference I'm a little bit nervous, I'm not going to lie, but here we go I'm nervous too I love you Mint

1483
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:57,960
I sing while belting Well, my girl's in the next room.

1484
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:01,620
Sometimes I wish she was you.

1485
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:05,020
I guess we never heard of these lyrics.

1486
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:07,720
I haven't listened to these.

1487
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:10,560
It's really good to hear your voice.

1488
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:15,080
Say my name, it sounds so sweet.

1489
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,020
Coming from the lips of an angel.

1490
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:22,840
Hearing those words, it makes me weak.

1491
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:27,820
And I never wanna say goodbye.

1492
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:34,000
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful.

1493
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:40,160
With the lips of an angel.

1494
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:51,820
It's funny that you're calling me tonight.

1495
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:57,660
And yes, I've dreamt of you too.

1496
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,320
But they were more like nightmares.

1497
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:04,940
And does he know you're talking to me?

1498
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,080
Will it start a fight?

1499
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:13,040
No, I don't think she has a clue.

1500
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:19,860
Well, my girl's in the next room.

1501
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:23,520
Sometimes I wish she was you.

1502
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:28,040
I guess we never really moved on.

1503
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:32,500
It's really good to hear your voice.

1504
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:36,500
Say my name, it sounds so sweet.

1505
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:39,860
Coming from the lips of an angel.

1506
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:44,640
Hearing those words, it makes me weak.

1507
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:49,640
And I never wanna say goodbye.

1508
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:55,880
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful.

1509
01:25:55,880 --> 01:26:01,600
With the lips of an angel.

1510
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,720
Emotional, emotional, okay.

1511
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:32,060
It's really good to hear your voice.

1512
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:36,040
Say my name, it sounds so sweet.

1513
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:39,440
Coming from the lips of an angel.

1514
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:44,060
Hearing those words, it makes me weak.

1515
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:49,340
And I never wanna say goodbye.

1516
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:55,380
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful.

1517
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,640
With the lips of an angel.

1518
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:10,200
Goodbye, but girl, you make it hard to be faithful.

1519
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:16,200
With the lips of an angel.

1520
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:19,900
Thanks, Matara!

1521
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:28,920
Honey, why you calling me so late?

1522
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,880
I love you, Mint.

1523
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:34,560
I love you, Wisp.

1524
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,500
I almost called you guys Momo.

1525
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:37,600
Get out of here.

1526
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:38,400
Don't call them Momo's.

1527
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:38,720
I love you, Wisp.

1528
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,580
I love you, Mint.

1529
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:40,380
Big kisses.

1530
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:46,200
Have an amazing rest of your day and enjoy this wonderful day.

1531
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,880
Filled with spooks and celebration.

1532
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,600
Bye-bye!

1533
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,860
And remember, I am Matara Khan.

1534
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:56,720
And you can bug me anytime.

1535
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:57,420
Bye, honey.

1536
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:58,300
Get out of here!

1537
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:02,800
She's such a yapper.

1538
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:05,900
Thank you, Matara!

1539
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:07,780
Thank you, thank you!

1540
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,980
Oh my goodness, that girl.

1541
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:17,800
She actually filmed that, I think, the day she was starting her sub-a-thon.

1542
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:25,580
I was like, um, Matara, unless you decide to record it during your sub-a-thon, can I get it today?

1543
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:26,760
And she was like, yeah.

1544
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:32,680
Like I said, everyone is so busy.

1545
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:35,100
And I felt so bad bugging people.

1546
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,560
I felt so bad.

1547
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:43,460
But I'm really happy that so many people decided to join in.

1548
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,240
The next one is probably not a surprise either.

1549
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:50,540
But this is a song that I've never sung before.

1550
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:54,120
Also, I don't know if it's obvious, but I've never listened to these videos before.

1551
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:58,100
If the audio is too loud or too quiet, just let me know.

1552
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:03,440
I kind of wanted to keep them a surprise.

1553
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:07,140
Oh shoot,

1554
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:12,850
I...

1555
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:17,550
I think I'll be okay.

1556
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:19,490
This one might be a little scuffed.

1557
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:20,990
But that's okay.

1558
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:22,470
That's okay.

1559
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:26,450
Okie dokie.

1560
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:28,230
Okie dokie, okie dokie.

1561
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:30,170
Let me put the notifications up.

1562
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:31,490
There we go.

1563
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:33,570
Okie dokie, okie dokie.

1564
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:35,310
Thank you guys for all the gifted memberships.

1565
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:38,470
Thank you guys for all the superchats.

1566
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:39,390
Thank you!

1567
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:40,210
Okie dokie.

1568
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:41,950
No, sorry.

1569
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:44,030
Dokie is not...

1570
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:47,270
You guys, I'm going to have a literal concert with Dokie, okay?

1571
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:51,630
If you want to hear me and Dokie sing, you gotta come to our concert.

1572
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,150
I can't spoil it here.

1573
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:54,030
Gosh.

1574
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,450
I can't spoil it here.

1575
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:58,650
You gotta come to the concert.

1576
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:00,790
Sheesh.

1577
01:30:00,910 --> 01:30:02,850
Alright, our next person.

1578
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:06,630
Kikariki!

1579
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:10,190
This is Takanashi Kiana from Hololive English.

1580
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:10,750
Hey!

1581
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:14,770
My favorite little ghost maid, Minto!

1582
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:18,850
Let's sing together to celebrate the day.

1583
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:19,330
Yeah!

1584
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:21,070
A Hello Project song.

1585
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:22,930
A Morning Musume song.

1586
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:23,410
Yes!

1587
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:24,250
Let's go!

1588
01:30:50,590 --> 01:30:54,110
Oh, this is my part.

1589
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:30,710
恋に敗れたさんがあり 早くここに来ればいい 逃げ出すなんて誰でもできる

1590
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:45,270
寂しくて眠れない そんな泣きだってあるでしょ I'm so frustrated, I could cry.

1591
01:31:49,820 --> 01:32:02,560
As time goes by, as the sky goes by, and when we are connected, will this planet be beautiful?

1592
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:33,050
What kind of voice will make you smile?

1593
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:36,090
Will we meet again in the next life?

1594
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:40,210
It's so painful.

1595
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:51,810
I know the distant future, but I can't decide what will happen tomorrow.

1596
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:54,590
It's not like how I usually feel.

1597
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:57,530
Oh, my heart.

1598
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:04,070
I love you, I love you.

1599
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:07,970
I feel your preciousness.

1600
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:13,210
I close my eyes and feel you.

1601
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:31,210
As time goes by, as the sky goes by, and when we are connected, will this planet be beautiful?

1602
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:37,940
Giwawa.

1603
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:44,180
Giwawa, I'm gonna haunt you.

1604
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:45,560
Giwawa, my ushi.

1605
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:48,800
Giwawa, she smells so good.

1606
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:49,660
Giwawa.

1607
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:56,650
The wind's soliloquy.

1608
01:33:58,010 --> 01:33:59,950
He loves you.

1609
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:05,190
The continuation of a dream.

1610
01:34:05,190 --> 01:34:09,630
The continuation of that is...

1611
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:13,350
I

1612
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:50,100
love you, I love you, I love you, I love you I feel it I close my eyes, I close my eyes I feel you Ah, ah, ah Beyond time, beyond time Beyond the sky, beyond the sky By the time we are connected Ah, ah, ah Will this planet be beautiful?

1613
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:58,520
Oh my gosh!

1614
01:34:58,860 --> 01:34:59,120
Ah!

1615
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:00,300
Fauna!

1616
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:01,040
Oh my god!

1617
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,180
Fauna, thank you for the friend!

1618
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:05,660
Ah, thank you!

1619
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:06,520
Hello, saplings!

1620
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:07,220
Welcome back!

1621
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:16,330
Oh, oh, oh, wait, that's her.

1622
01:35:16,330 --> 01:35:17,150
Oops!

1623
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:19,290
Yay!

1624
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:22,190
Thank you so much for having me!

1625
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:25,050
That was fun singing together!

1626
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:26,950
Thank you!

1627
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:27,970
I love you!

1628
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:31,750
And have a beautiful time for the rest of the stream!

1629
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:32,470
Thank you!

1630
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:34,470
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay!

1631
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:37,930
Thank you, Kiwamo!

1632
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:39,830
Thank you, thank you!

1633
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:44,750
That was Toki wo Koe, Sora wo Koe by Morning Musume!

1634
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:44,890
Yay!

1635
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:48,550
Maybe I should have written the setlist.

1636
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:49,550
My bad, sorry.

1637
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:50,250
I'm nervous.

1638
01:35:50,530 --> 01:35:51,830
I'm really... Oh my gosh!

1639
01:35:52,810 --> 01:35:53,690
Thank you!

1640
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:54,490
Thank you!

1641
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:56,290
Oh my gosh, thank you!

1642
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:02,390
Sorry, I'm really nervous.

1643
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:04,310
And now I had...

1644
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:06,090
Oh my gosh, Fauna, I was watching you!

1645
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:08,770
I was watching you right before I started!

1646
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:09,870
Thank you for writing!

1647
01:36:11,410 --> 01:36:13,130
You're so cute in 3D!

1648
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:16,310
Oh my gosh, and your dancing skeletons and everything!

1649
01:36:17,610 --> 01:36:19,230
I'm a big fan of Fauna.

1650
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:23,310
Wow, I'm really honored.

1651
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:24,630
Oh my gosh, thank you!

1652
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:25,350
Thank you guys!

1653
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:26,710
Thank you so much!

1654
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:30,630
And...

1655
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:31,130
Yeah!

1656
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:35,030
So...

1657
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:36,290
I have...

1658
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,110
4 more people!

1659
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:40,830
Oh gosh, I'm shaking.

1660
01:36:41,190 --> 01:36:41,750
I'm shaking!

1661
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:44,250
The next person is another...

1662
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:45,690
Another...

1663
01:36:45,690 --> 01:36:48,370
Vtuber with an amazing, amazing voice.

1664
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:49,770
Again, I'm very honored.

1665
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:51,470
Especially because she's also so busy.

1666
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:55,210
It's funny because...

1667
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:58,210
I actually have 2 Chaperone songs.

1668
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:00,610
In this.

1669
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:01,310
And...

1670
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:02,570
I mean...

1671
01:37:02,570 --> 01:37:04,750
I don't know if anybody's curious, but...

1672
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:06,730
But...

1673
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:08,090
I mean, this is my debut.

1674
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:09,510
Of course it's archived!

1675
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:10,470
So...

1676
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,750
Yeah, the next person is...

1677
01:37:14,890 --> 01:37:17,030
Someone I also really look up to.

1678
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:19,890
And I think is a great streamer.

1679
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:20,670
Mousy!

1680
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:24,050
Hello!

1681
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:27,370
She's so small.

1682
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:57,320
The arms are like an angel through the glass on roof.

1683
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:59,820
I don't wanna call it off.

1684
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,960
But you don't wanna call it love.

1685
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:05,500
Only wanna be the one that I call baby.

1686
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:09,580
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars.

1687
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:13,520
Show another shot, I'm trying to stop the feeling.

1688
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:17,820
You can say it's just the way you are.

1689
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:21,370
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason.

1690
01:38:21,370 --> 01:38:23,050
Good luck, babe.

1691
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:23,870
Well, good luck babe.

1692
01:38:23,890 --> 01:38:26,030
Well, good luck babe.

1693
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:26,090
Well, good luck babe.

1694
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:30,010
You have to stop the world just to stop the feeling.

1695
01:38:30,010 --> 01:38:31,350
Good luck babe.

1696
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:32,010
Well well well.

1697
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:33,150
Well good luck babe.

1698
01:38:33,150 --> 01:38:34,110
Well baby boy.

1699
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:38,330
You have to stop the world just to stop the feeling.

1700
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:39,790
You can say.

1701
01:38:40,410 --> 01:38:41,370
Well who cares?

1702
01:38:42,430 --> 01:38:46,450
It's a sexually explicit kinda love affair.

1703
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:47,430
And I cry.

1704
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:49,530
It's not fair.

1705
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:55,530
I just need a little love and I just need a little air.

1706
01:38:55,690 --> 01:38:59,710
Think I'm gonna call it off, even if you call it love.

1707
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:03,210
I just wanna love someone who calls me baby.

1708
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:11,250
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars, Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling.

1709
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:19,530
You can say it's just the way you are, Make a new excuse, another stupid reason.

1710
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:21,570
Well, good luck, babe.

1711
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:27,810
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling.

1712
01:39:27,970 --> 01:39:31,410
Well, good luck, babe.

1713
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:36,150
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling.

1714
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:39,510
When

1715
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:52,410
you wake up next to him in the middle of the night, With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife.

1716
01:39:52,530 --> 01:40:00,350
And when you think about me all of those years ago, You're standing face to face with, I told you so.

1717
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:04,550
You know I hate to say that I told you so.

1718
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:08,870
You know I hate to say it, but I told you so.

1719
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:17,110
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars, Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling.

1720
01:40:17,110 --> 01:40:25,510
You can say it's just the way you are, Make a new excuse, another stupid reason.

1721
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:28,390
Well, good luck, babe.

1722
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:33,510
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling.

1723
01:40:33,730 --> 01:40:37,110
Well, good luck, babe.

1724
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:41,450
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling.

1725
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:46,110
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling.

1726
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:51,210
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling.

1727
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:56,910
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling.

1728
01:41:00,610 --> 01:41:02,530
Thank you, Mousy!

1729
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:09,910
Oh my god, so cute.

1730
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:11,030
I love you, bye!

1731
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:17,960
Oh my gosh, I love her Halloween outfit.

1732
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:20,300
So cute!

1733
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:20,960
Yay!

1734
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:22,200
That was good luck, babe.

1735
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:24,540
With Iron Mouse!

1736
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,380
Thank you!

1737
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:32,460
Oh wait, I think I put both of the Chapel Road songs next to each other.

1738
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:34,580
I didn't mean to.

1739
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:36,440
Oh no, I didn't.

1740
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:39,600
Oh my gosh, this next one though, I'm really nervous about.

1741
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:45,680
Because I practiced it, but honestly, I chose this song with my own selfish reasoning.

1742
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:52,120
Because I thought that this singer, I thought that she could do a really, really great job with it.

1743
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:56,360
And I felt bad because she didn't know the song.

1744
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,340
And then I was like, wait, we can change it.

1745
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:02,260
I know you're busy.

1746
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:06,760
And she was like, no, I'll learn it.

1747
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:11,120
And she's just the sweetest person ever.

1748
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:15,080
I'd like to welcome to the stage...

1749
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:17,820
Liz!

1750
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,920
Let me get smaller.

1751
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:34,600
I, I just woke up from a dream.

1752
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:38,400
Where you and I had to say goodbye.

1753
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:43,900
And I don't know what it all means.

1754
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:48,620
But since I survived, I realized.

1755
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:53,260
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow.

1756
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:57,620
Nobody's promise tomorrow.

1757
01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:02,060
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night.

1758
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:04,060
Like it's the last night.

1759
01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:11,240
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you.

1760
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:20,680
If the party was over and our time on earth was through.

1761
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:26,780
I'd wanna hold you just for a while.

1762
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:31,180
And die with a smile.

1763
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:38,040
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you.

1764
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:52,240
Lost, lost in the words that we scream.

1765
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:56,140
I don't even wanna do this anymore.

1766
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,660
Cause you already know what you mean to me.

1767
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:05,240
And our love's the only war worth fighting for.

1768
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:10,580
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow.

1769
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:15,040
Nobody's promise tomorrow.

1770
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:19,620
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night.

1771
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,860
Like it's the last night.

1772
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:29,060
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you.

1773
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:37,740
If the party was over and our time on earth was through.

1774
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:44,460
I'd wanna hold you just for a while.

1775
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:48,900
And die with a smile.

1776
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:55,840
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you.

1777
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:57,300
Oh gosh, I completely forgot.

1778
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:59,160
You guys, I'm so starstruck.

1779
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:00,100
I'm next to you.

1780
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,400
She just sounds so good.

1781
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:05,840
Next to you.

1782
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:10,940
Right next to you.

1783
01:45:28,650 --> 01:45:36,970
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you.

1784
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:46,110
If the party was over and our time on earth was through.

1785
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:53,290
I'd wanna hold you just for a while.

1786
01:45:53,710 --> 01:45:57,110
And die with a smile.

1787
01:45:57,970 --> 01:46:04,170
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you.

1788
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:13,170
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you.

1789
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:22,170
I'd wanna be next to you.

1790
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:29,690
Oh my gosh, thank you.

1791
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:34,010
Thank you so much for having me on your special day.

1792
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:35,550
Thank you so much.

1793
01:46:35,610 --> 01:46:39,910
It means the world to me to sing with you.

1794
01:46:40,110 --> 01:46:41,690
I wanna be next to you.

1795
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:44,610
I wanna be next to Maid Mint.

1796
01:46:44,830 --> 01:46:45,590
Thank you so much.

1797
01:46:45,670 --> 01:46:47,270
Have a great rest of your stream.

1798
01:46:47,910 --> 01:46:48,350
Yes!

1799
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:50,130
Oh my gosh.

1800
01:46:50,450 --> 01:46:51,310
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1801
01:46:51,310 --> 01:46:52,390
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1802
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:57,810
There she goes.

1803
01:47:00,010 --> 01:47:01,430
Oh my gosh.

1804
01:47:01,930 --> 01:47:04,950
The cutest, the beautifullest.

1805
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:07,650
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

1806
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:09,430
I kind of... you guys are for real.

1807
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:13,590
I chose that song from my own selfish desires.

1808
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:16,270
I was just like she will kill this song.

1809
01:47:16,410 --> 01:47:18,630
And hopefully she sings it again in karaoke.

1810
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:25,890
Oh my gosh, she's so... I know I'm like totally debuffing myself.

1811
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:29,530
Because I chose like the most incredible singers ever.

1812
01:47:29,770 --> 01:47:32,430
But it's really just because I wanted to hear them sing.

1813
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:36,050
It's really just my own selfish.

1814
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:39,870
I wanna hear these beautiful people sing in my ears.

1815
01:47:42,070 --> 01:47:43,130
I'm the winner.

1816
01:47:43,550 --> 01:47:45,830
Even if I sound so bad next to them.

1817
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:51,850
The next person is also just the most incredible singer ever.

1818
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:56,410
And someone I've been talking to more recently.

1819
01:47:58,370 --> 01:48:00,430
And, you know, everybody... Oh my gosh.

1820
01:48:00,530 --> 01:48:01,990
Everybody's just been so kind.

1821
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,980
Hold on, my YouTube froze again.

1822
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:14,460
I just...

1823
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:20,680
Just having so many... so many...

1824
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:23,080
Hopefully I can do a revenge of that song.

1825
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:27,360
I'll ask Elizabeth if I can use her vocals again.

1826
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,300
Or something, I don't know, but...

1827
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:39,300
Just all the support, the amount of support that you guys have all shown me and so many other Vtubers.

1828
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:44,420
All my friends too, so...

1829
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:45,280
Sorry, oh gosh.

1830
01:48:52,410 --> 01:48:53,930
So, sorry.

1831
01:48:54,350 --> 01:48:57,910
I'm really starstruck and just nervous.

1832
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:00,430
I sound like Dookie.

1833
01:49:00,570 --> 01:49:01,850
We'll do revenge tomorrow.

1834
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:02,650
Okay,

1835
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:11,570
next one is with the beautiful, the talented, everybody loves her.

1836
01:49:12,150 --> 01:49:14,530
I love her, maybe the most.

1837
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:15,510
No, I'm just kidding.

1838
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:16,710
I don't think so.

1839
01:49:16,810 --> 01:49:20,390
I think the jailbirds probably love her the most.

1840
01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:21,130
Please!

1841
01:49:21,290 --> 01:49:22,710
Hold on, I'm gonna take another sippy.

1842
01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:26,390
Let's go!

1843
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:28,010
Nerissa!

1844
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:40,970
Nerissa Ravencroft!

1845
01:49:41,190 --> 01:49:41,650
Nerissa!

1846
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:43,590
Yeah!

1847
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:50,470
Happy Halloween!

1848
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:59,870
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8!

1849
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:38,880
Doing it with me!

1850
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:44,540
Oh,

1851
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,200
I said her part on accident!

1852
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:53,480
I'm sorry, Nerissa!

1853
01:51:08,330 --> 01:51:11,300
I woke up alone, staring at my ceiling.

1854
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:14,760
I try not to care, but it hurts my feelings.

1855
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:18,260
You don't have to stare, come here, get with it.

1856
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,580
No one's touched me there in a damn hot minute.

1857
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:24,240
And baby, don't you like this beat?

1858
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:27,760
I made it so you'd sleep with me.

1859
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:35,620
It's like 199 degrees when you're doing it with me, doing it with me.

1860
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:39,100
H-O-T-T-O-G-O, you can clap and touch your toes.

1861
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:40,700
Now raise your hands and body roll.

1862
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:42,520
Dance it out, you're hot to go.

1863
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:46,000
H-O-T-T-O-G-O, snap and clap and touch your toes.

1864
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:47,560
Raise your hands, now body roll.

1865
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:49,280
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

1866
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:55,920
H-O-T-T-O-G-O, you can take me hot to go.

1867
01:51:56,340 --> 01:52:02,960
H-O-T-T-O-G-O, you can take me hot to go.

1868
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:04,860
What's it take to get your number?

1869
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:06,620
What's it take to bring you home?

1870
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:08,260
Hurry up, it's time for supper.

1871
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:10,080
Order up, I'm hot to go.

1872
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:11,740
What's it take to get your number?

1873
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:13,460
Hurry up, I'm scotting cold.

1874
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:15,080
Hurry up, it's time for supper.

1875
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,020
Hurry up, it's time to go.

1876
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:23,380
H-O-T-T-O-G-O, you can take me hot to go.

1877
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:30,400
H-O-T-T-O-G-O, you can take me hot to go.

1878
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:36,880
H-O-T-T-O-G-O, you can take me hot to go.

1879
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:44,200
H-O-T-T-O-G-O, you can take me hot to go.

1880
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:47,620
It's hot in here.

1881
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:49,860
Is anyone else hot?

1882
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:52,220
Yeah, I'm hot.

1883
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:53,200
You're coming home with me?

1884
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:53,640
Yeah.

1885
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:54,440
Okay.

1886
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:55,580
It's hot.

1887
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:56,360
Oh my god.

1888
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:57,600
I'll call the cab.

1889
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:01,680
Thanks for having me!

1890
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:02,440
I love

1891
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:12,670
her so much.

1892
01:53:12,790 --> 01:53:13,930
Oh my gosh.

1893
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:15,690
Nerissa Ravencroft, everybody.

1894
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:17,330
Oh my gosh.

1895
01:53:17,450 --> 01:53:18,310
Thank you!

1896
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:21,950
I'm so sorry I sang over your one part.

1897
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:23,930
Nerissa, I was just too excited.

1898
01:53:24,450 --> 01:53:25,870
I was just too excited to sing with you.

1899
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:28,350
Yeah!

1900
01:53:31,830 --> 01:53:35,870
Okay, I have one last person that I'd like to sing with.

1901
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:42,130
Which, actually, a lot of people were like, who is this?

1902
01:53:42,130 --> 01:53:55,290
And I want to say, last night, Raora DMed me and she was just like, Mint, I'm looking forward to your 3.0!

1903
01:53:55,570 --> 01:53:58,250
And I was like, Raora, grazie!

1904
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:01,190
But also, I'm so sorry.

1905
01:54:01,390 --> 01:54:14,450
I chose that oshi mark to throw people off the scent, but it was because it's someone cat related, but I didn't want to use their oshi mark.

1906
01:54:15,570 --> 01:54:19,230
And so, I was like, I'm so sorry if people were confused.

1907
01:54:19,470 --> 01:54:23,870
But I would love, Raora, if you ever want to sing one day.

1908
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:27,910
I would be so honored to sing with a big cat.

1909
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:30,950
I want to sing with so many people.

1910
01:54:31,070 --> 01:54:33,410
Like I said, I wanted to sing with so many more people.

1911
01:54:33,610 --> 01:54:35,010
I wanted to sing with...

1912
01:54:35,010 --> 01:54:41,050
It's funny, I chose Bishoujo and Hololive, but I wanted to sing with indies as well, and just so many people.

1913
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:44,050
I wanted to sing with lots of friends.

1914
01:54:46,190 --> 01:54:49,270
But, like I said, there's lots of people in the video game.

1915
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:50,850
Why did I say it like that?

1916
01:54:51,030 --> 01:54:53,970
In the game that I made with the team.

1917
01:54:54,370 --> 01:54:57,050
So, you can check them out in there too and everything.

1918
01:54:57,510 --> 01:54:59,310
Why is everybody saying, Germa, stop!

1919
01:55:01,290 --> 01:55:03,250
Stop, you're ruining my wholesome moment.

1920
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:04,150
Stop!

1921
01:55:05,450 --> 01:55:06,630
Video game.

1922
01:55:07,450 --> 01:55:14,690
The last song is with someone very special to me, of course.

1923
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:18,950
Hold on.

1924
01:55:20,230 --> 01:55:22,630
Let me make sure I have the right lyrics.

1925
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:36,250
Someone very special to me, and of course, who else would that be except...

1926
01:55:37,370 --> 01:55:38,170
My mama!

1927
01:55:40,650 --> 01:55:43,570
Why are you guys saying, Mr. Beast, Kojima, stop!

1928
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:45,530
You're ruining my wholesome... Stop!

1929
01:55:45,630 --> 01:55:45,810
Don't!

1930
01:55:45,910 --> 01:55:46,310
Spaghetti!

1931
01:55:48,510 --> 01:55:49,130
Stop it!

1932
01:55:49,890 --> 01:55:50,470
Stop it!

1933
01:55:50,770 --> 01:55:51,410
Oh my gosh.

1934
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:53,710
Ayami mama!

1935
01:55:54,290 --> 01:55:55,830
This is the last song of the night, everybody.

1936
01:55:58,090 --> 01:55:59,110
Thank you for coming out.

1937
01:55:59,390 --> 01:56:02,490
Stick around though, because I want you to see my ending screen too.

1938
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:02,890
It's cute.

1939
01:56:07,910 --> 01:56:08,270
Hello.

1940
01:56:08,730 --> 01:56:09,710
Hi, everyone.

1941
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:10,970
I'm Ayami.

1942
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:14,230
I'm an illustrator and VTuber and...

1943
01:56:14,230 --> 01:56:14,390
Yeah!

1944
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:15,350
Me too.

1945
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:16,150
You?

1946
01:56:16,510 --> 01:56:16,790
Mama!

1947
01:56:17,790 --> 01:56:17,930
Yeah!

1948
01:56:30,770 --> 01:56:31,410
Let's go!

1949
01:56:31,870 --> 01:56:32,170
Yeah!

1950
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:41,070
I am a dreamer.

1951
01:56:41,390 --> 01:56:42,750
Hidden power.

1952
01:56:46,890 --> 01:56:47,810
Mama is cute.

1953
01:56:58,410 --> 01:56:59,810
Hihihihi!

1954
01:57:17,810 --> 01:57:18,530
I'm not in a hurry.

1955
01:57:21,010 --> 01:57:23,730
I want to find it.

1956
01:57:25,070 --> 01:57:26,330
I want to make it come true.

1957
01:57:28,190 --> 01:57:32,570
I believe that there's nothing that cannot be overcome.

1958
01:57:34,050 --> 01:57:42,710
Like a song, like a miracle, emotions change everything.

1959
01:57:42,710 --> 01:57:43,470
I'm gonna sing it.

1960
01:57:45,290 --> 01:57:49,750
I'm sure, I'm sure.

1961
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:53,830
It's probably...

1962
01:57:54,710 --> 01:57:55,850
The mic.

1963
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:06,730
I am a dreamer.

1964
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:10,410
Hidden power.

1965
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:14,070
A world

1966
01:58:18,030 --> 01:58:20,770
I have yet to see.

1967
01:58:23,010 --> 01:58:27,470
No matter what is waiting for me there.

1968
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:33,590
Even if it's different from my ideals.

1969
01:58:35,990 --> 01:58:38,250
I have no fear.

1970
01:58:39,110 --> 01:58:41,430
The birds are riding on the wind.

1971
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:43,970
I'm going on a journey.

1972
01:58:44,790 --> 01:58:47,990
From today to tomorrow.

1973
01:58:49,870 --> 01:58:51,430
I want to tell you.

1974
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:53,990
I want to scream.

1975
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:59,910
I'm the only one in this world.

1976
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:02,670
Like a prayer.

1977
01:59:04,650 --> 01:59:05,590
Like a star.

1978
01:59:06,590 --> 01:59:09,890
It's a small light.

1979
01:59:10,530 --> 01:59:11,890
But someday.

1980
01:59:13,110 --> 01:59:13,550
More.

1981
01:59:15,810 --> 01:59:16,490
More.

1982
01:59:17,790 --> 01:59:19,930
I want to be stronger.

1983
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:33,440
There is no limit.

1984
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:36,400
The possibilities are here.

1985
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:39,320
In this hand.

1986
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:44,420
It's gonna be your world.

1987
01:59:51,410 --> 01:59:55,770
I want to find it.

1988
01:59:57,210 --> 01:59:58,950
I want to make it come true.

1989
02:00:00,410 --> 02:00:01,290
I believe.

1990
02:00:01,770 --> 02:00:02,610
That's all.

1991
02:00:03,170 --> 02:00:05,190
There is nothing I can't overcome.

1992
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:07,070
Like singing.

1993
02:00:07,070 --> 02:00:09,770
Like a miracle.

1994
02:00:11,230 --> 02:00:12,630
My feelings.

1995
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:15,730
Will change everything.

1996
02:00:17,350 --> 02:00:18,090
I'm sure.

1997
02:00:20,610 --> 02:00:21,310
I'm sure.

1998
02:00:22,410 --> 02:00:23,850
I'll be so surprised.

1999
02:00:27,290 --> 02:00:27,610
Push!

2000
02:00:28,070 --> 02:00:28,370
Push!

2001
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:29,090
Push!

2002
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:29,770
Congratulations!

2003
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:31,470
Thank you!

2004
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:32,290
I love you!

2005
02:00:32,610 --> 02:00:33,710
I love you!

2006
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:34,050
Thank you everyone!

2007
02:00:34,050 --> 02:00:34,870
Thank you!

2008
02:00:36,090 --> 02:00:39,870
I love you.

2009
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:53,770
Yummy mama everybody!

2010
02:00:54,790 --> 02:00:56,790
I got really emotional during that.

2011
02:00:58,170 --> 02:01:00,150
I got really emotional during that.

2012
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:03,530
I have one last song that I would like to sing.

2013
02:01:04,270 --> 02:01:05,570
It's a Halloween song.

2014
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:07,010
It's not very long.

2015
02:01:07,850 --> 02:01:14,150
Thank you guys again for the 3.0 debut and everything.

2016
02:01:14,810 --> 02:01:15,550
Thank you guys!

2017
02:01:15,670 --> 02:01:17,810
I really appreciate everybody being here.

2018
02:01:18,490 --> 02:01:20,630
And all the support.

2019
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:23,250
Please continue to support me!

2020
02:01:24,150 --> 02:01:24,850
Thank you!

2021
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:28,350
I don't want the mash.

2022
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:29,390
It's not the mash!

2023
02:01:29,710 --> 02:01:31,170
This is a little more wholesome.

2024
02:01:31,870 --> 02:01:33,490
Like I said, it's a Halloween song.

2025
02:01:33,650 --> 02:01:34,950
I mean, unless you want the mash.

2026
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:37,330
I'll give you the mash.

2027
02:01:41,390 --> 02:01:42,390
Last song.

2028
02:01:42,930 --> 02:01:45,550
And then I will see you tomorrow for karaoke!

2029
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:46,990
We'll do the mash tomorrow.

2030
02:01:48,930 --> 02:01:50,490
No, we do not want it.

2031
02:01:50,490 --> 02:01:50,890
Are you sure?

2032
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:52,430
Are you sure?

2033
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:55,550
I don't know.

2034
02:01:56,030 --> 02:01:57,430
I see a lot of yeses.

2035
02:01:59,050 --> 02:02:00,490
OK, last song is wholesome.

2036
02:02:00,990 --> 02:02:01,930
OK guys, it's wholesome.

2037
02:02:02,430 --> 02:02:03,010
Wholesome vibes.

2038
02:02:04,950 --> 02:02:07,610
Wholesome vibes for my wholesome debut, OK?

2039
02:02:12,370 --> 02:02:14,020
This one is from a...

2040
02:02:14,770 --> 02:02:16,230
Actually, I was watching...

2041
02:02:16,230 --> 02:02:19,150
They did a concert because this show has been around for 10 years.

2042
02:02:19,230 --> 02:02:20,710
And they did a concert for it recently.

2043
02:02:21,270 --> 02:02:22,930
Just a couple days ago.

2044
02:02:23,070 --> 02:02:24,630
And I was watching it and I was like...

2045
02:02:24,630 --> 02:02:25,890
Oh my gosh, I was crying.

2046
02:02:26,370 --> 02:02:27,190
It was so beautiful.

2047
02:02:28,350 --> 02:02:31,070
And it's from a show that I love very very much.

2048
02:02:31,070 --> 02:02:35,090
Called Over the Garden Wall that I watch every Halloween.

2049
02:02:35,790 --> 02:02:38,890
So I will sing Into the Unknown.

2050
02:02:41,970 --> 02:02:44,790
I'm really sorry if there was volume stuff too.

2051
02:02:45,710 --> 02:02:49,090
I'm really sorry if there was volume stuff with everybody.

2052
02:02:49,350 --> 02:02:50,750
I was trying to adjust while singing.

2053
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:30,770
All that was lost is revealed Our long bygone burdens Mere echoes of the spring But where have we come And where shall we end If dreams can't come true Then why not pretend?

2054
02:03:32,530 --> 02:04:03,350
How the gentle wind beckons through the leaves As autumn colors fall Dancing in a swirl of golden memories The loveliest lights of all

2055
02:04:08,570 --> 02:04:09,450
Yay!

2056
02:04:10,190 --> 02:04:11,690
Okay, you guys convinced me.

2057
02:04:13,710 --> 02:04:15,150
You guys convinced me.

2058
02:04:21,730 --> 02:04:23,470
Oh shoot, where's my lyrics?

2059
02:04:24,230 --> 02:04:24,510
Uh-oh.

2060
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:27,690
Wait, where's my lyrics?

2061
02:04:28,730 --> 02:04:30,810
Wait, where's my lyrics?

2062
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:31,570
Oh no!

2063
02:04:34,730 --> 02:04:35,890
Wait, hold on!

2064
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,100
I'm gonna start over.

2065
02:04:52,160 --> 02:05:27,580
I was heading to a yacht late last night When my eyes beheld a skippity sigh Where the Sigmarusler began to rise And violently mock the Costco guys He did the mash He rinsed the bobs and gats He put the fries in the pan He did the mash He gave him a smash or a pat He did the mash He rinsed up all the gats From the back rooms in the Ohio streets Where the wolf inside me Last and least!

2066
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:34,340
The gooners all jelled to grow their choads Didn't give tips from me cause I'm a Loot Smacks pro!

2067
02:05:36,040 --> 02:06:10,640
He rizzed up all the gads Gave them a smash or a pass They put the fries in the bag He rizzed up all the gads The streamers were all doing the gritty Baby Gronk just rizzed up Lizzy The Rizzler brought big justice Aiden Ross and Kai's clan There were snowpops inside Everyone began to mew Patrick Vabe bit on Oxclay One,

2068
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:12,320
two, three, buckle my shoe!

2069
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:16,960
Blue Tie Kid was on his Sigma grind I don't know... Strixum Prime!

2070
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:45,060
He rizzed up all the gads Gave them a smash or a pass They put the fries in the bag He rizzed up all the gads Pausing his stream, Mint Phantom did yak Seems like Doki Bird was about to cap Looked around to see if there was enough movement and said Did you guys know the low taper meme is still massive?

2071
02:06:46,780 --> 02:07:14,140
He rizzed up all the gads Gave them a smash or a pass They put the fries in the bag He rizzed up all the gads Everyone loves Skibity, he's the ultimate Giga Chad And my brain rot bash is the hit of the land For you, the beta, this bash was meant to The funniest meme ever made is HACK TO LAST!

2072
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:30,040
He put the fries in the bag He rizzed up all the gads Gat good!

2073
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:37,360
Easy Matara, you sussy Ohio Gat good!

2074
02:07:39,580 --> 02:07:41,160

2075
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:45,480
Gat good!

2076
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:51,980
Easy Matara, easy Matara Gat good!

2077
02:07:56,660 --> 02:07:58,000
Thank you guys!

2078
02:08:39,770 --> 02:08:53,690
