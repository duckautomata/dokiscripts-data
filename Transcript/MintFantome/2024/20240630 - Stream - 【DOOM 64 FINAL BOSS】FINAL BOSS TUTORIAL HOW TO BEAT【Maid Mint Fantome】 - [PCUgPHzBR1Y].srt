1
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,250
Welcome back, master and lady.

2
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,150
Hello everybody!

3
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,030
We are finally here.

4
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,810
Oh my goodness.

5
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:30,530
We are finally at the finale of Doom 64, finally.

6
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,270
Hello!

7
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,790
Hello!

8
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,930
5 hour stream?

9
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:39,330
No!

10
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,650
It can't be 5 hours.

11
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,790
Because I have another stream in 2 hours!

12
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,070
And obviously, didn't you see the title?

13
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,450
The title is...

14
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,230
How to beat Doom 64 Final Boss Tutorial.

15
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,330
So...

16
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,150
So...

17
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,430
I've been stuck on her for a month.

18
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,150
I got you.

19
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,430
I got you.

20
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,310
I have the cheese.

21
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,030
I have the fresh cheese.

22
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,650
Actually, it's not fresh.

23
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,950
It's been marinating for years.

24
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,890
That's the good stuff.

25
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,090
The smelly bits.

26
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,030
Ah, that's the cheese!

27
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,610
That's the cheese!

28
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:22,690
Spoiled cheese?

29
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,990
No!

30
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,490
Spoiled cheese just becomes blue cheese.

31
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,690
There's no such thing as spoiled cheese.

32
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,110
Do I understand the stream title correctly?

33
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,390
It's the final boss tutorial on how to beat...

34
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,510
Maidment Phantom!

35
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,330
What?

36
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:35,650
What?

37
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:35,910
What?

38
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,330
I'm not the final boss.

39
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,380
My Gou Shijin-sama or Jou-sama would be the final boss.

40
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,380
I'm just a maid.

41
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,420
I'm just a maid!

42
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,020
Gosh!

43
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,800
Stop it.

44
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,960
Show us the...

45
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,440
Read speedrun strats on this boss.

46
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,200
I got you!

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,300
I think.

48
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,100
I like my cheese like I like my Oshii.

49
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,920
Age to perfection with great patience.

50
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,220
Yeah, you'll need patience.

51
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,580
Here.

52
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,920
I think.

53
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,240
Have patience with me.

54
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,740
You know?

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,420
So what do you mean...

56
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,860
What do you mean aged?

57
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,260
I haven't aged a day since I died.

58
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,000
So...

59
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,320
I haven't aged literally a day since I died.

60
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,380
Ghosts don't age.

61
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,480
It doesn't matter what age you die at.

62
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,940
I...

63
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,260
I'm forever 19.

64
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,680
Good luck with the final boss.

65
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,280
Could I get a happy birthday from the silly ghost maid, please?

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,580
Austin, happy birthday!

67
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,780
Happy birthday to you.

68
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,460
Happy birthday to you.

69
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,520
Happy birthday, dear Austin.

70
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,580
Happy birthday to you.

71
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,040
Happy birthday!

72
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,920
Yeah!

73
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,660
After three weeks of my sensory pain being gone, it has returned in full force.

74
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Oh, no, Brandon.

75
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,660
I'm so sorry.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,140
Well, hopefully all the pain that I caused to these demons will get your mind off of the pain that you have right now.

77
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,960
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,820
If you never age, does that mean you never wash?

79
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,560
What?

80
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,980
That's not the same thing.

81
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,700
What are you talking about?

82
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,540
Oh, my goodness.

83
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,240
Which one am I on?

84
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,280
I think...

85
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,120
This one.

86
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,440
I think this one has all...

87
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:57,660
Wait.

88
00:05:59,580 --> 00:05:59,980
Hmm.

89
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,920
I think...

90
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,280
I think...

91
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,600
I think...

92
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,260
I think...

93
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:07,360
I think...

94
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,720
This one.

95
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,760
Second to the last one is the one before you died.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,480
Oh, okay.

97
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,360
Minto, are you going to try and go to Aqua Final Main Live?

98
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,600
I saw they announced that today, right?

99
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,940
They may not be a bit suspending, but I felt a huge pit in my stomach seeing the announcement.

100
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:26,620
Yeah.

101
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,420
I'm so sorry.

102
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,600
It depends on when it is, right?

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,260
It depends on when it is.

104
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,380
Starting...

105
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,680
Starting...

106
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,500
September, I'm going to try and not travel so much.

107
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,280
So...

108
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:55,180
But, I mean, if it's for something like that, I'm kind of hoping that maybe it will overlap with, like, another trip that I'm doing.

109
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,520
We'll see.

110
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,180
P.K.

111
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,400
P.K.

112
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:57,500
Hi, Peter.

113
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,360
Welcome to membership.

114
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,160
Thank you.

115
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,480
Yeah.

116
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,700
That was so sad.

117
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,480
I didn't get to...

118
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,040
You know, I was actually in Japan during Muse's Final Live.

119
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,740
I was there, but I didn't have...

120
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,320
I never got...

121
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,040
I didn't get tickets.

122
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,620
But I actually had to go to the Tokyo Dome area to register some paperwork.

123
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,680
And so...

124
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,400
But it was on the day of the Final Live that I went.

125
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,400
And so...

126
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:33,620
And so I saw, like, all the crowds around Tokyo Dome, and I was just like, ah, that should have been me.

127
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,920
So I didn't...

128
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,640
I didn't get to see the show, but I was there.

129
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,660
I was there.

130
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,500
Just not there.

131
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,960
I forgot to tell you, yesterday was Ace Combat 29th anniversary.

132
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,560
29th anniversary!

133
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,040
Happy birthday, Ace Combat 29.

134
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,400
Oh my god.

135
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:57,800
Oh my gosh.

136
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,320
That's crazy.

137
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,200
The FOMO.

138
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,660
I know!

139
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,560
I had first-hand FOMO.

140
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,920
I was like...

141
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,060
I was there.

142
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,860
I was watching everybody.

143
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,920
You know, I was gonna say having fun, but they were probably all sad.

144
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,960
So maybe...

145
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,800
Not so much fun, but, you know, they were all there.

146
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,080
Existing.

147
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,280
Thank you for being you.

148
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,280
What do I...

149
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,720
What did I do?

150
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,380
Oh my gosh, I just dropped my pillow.

151
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,880
I have my...

152
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,000
I got my Ayami pillow in the other day.

153
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,400
Oh my gosh.

154
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:27,980
My dad right here.

155
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:35,960
Um, that she had one that if you went to the cafe, um, that she had in Akihabara, the Ayami Sensei cafÃ©.

156
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,400
They were...

157
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,140
She was selling it and...

158
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,140
You had to order it.

159
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,320
So, it finally came.

160
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,900
And...

161
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,240
And, um...

162
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,320
Oh my gosh.

163
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,180
I was looking at Ayami Sensei's fan box this morning!

164
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,100
And, um...

165
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,720
If you're subscribed to Ayami's fan box...

166
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,700
I am not!

167
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,620
I'd like to have seen something.

168
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,940
No spoilers because it is kind of... it is... it is a paywall.

169
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,500
So... I saw... did you see?

170
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,300
She tweeted it.

171
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,430
I wasn't really on Twitter much today because I have been cleaning.

172
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,510
She did tweet it a little... but there's something else in there.

173
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,130
But... I'll retweet it.

174
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,810
I'll retweet it.

175
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,850
There's something else in there.

176
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,550
There's something else in there.

177
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,450
That is kind of funny.

178
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:49,950
But...

179
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,090
If you can't afford it, that's totally fine too.

180
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,750
But it's kind of funny.

181
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,530
A b-b-b-bonus?

182
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,230
Yeah... quite... quite something a little silly.

183
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,330
Which I think is so funny.

184
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,490
Especially...

185
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,590
I can't say much because, you know, it's not my right to say.

186
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,770
But it does involve me.

187
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,790
Ayami salesperson.

188

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,090
Okay.

391
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:46,990
Okay.

392
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,190
Okay.

393
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:47,430
Okay.

394
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,370
Okay.

395
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:48,630
Okay.

396
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:48,790
Okay.

397
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,800
Oh shoot!

398
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,020
Oh, shoot!

399
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,240
Oh, shoot!

400
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Oh, shoot!

401
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,480
Oh, shoot!

402
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:05,480
Oh, shoot!

403
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:05,820
Oh, shoot!

404
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:05,940
Oh, shoot!

405
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:05,940
Oh, shoot!

406
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,040
Oh, shoot!

407
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,160
Oh, shoot!

408
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,260
Oh, shoot!

409
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:20,980
This is the strut!

410
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,520
This is the strut!

411
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,560
Yeah!

412
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,420
I did it!

413
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,940
Just keep going!

414
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,440
This is the strut!

415
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,800
Yeah!

416
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,960
I did it!

417
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,860
I figured it out!

418
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,760
I got it!

419
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,040
It's not gonna kill him.

420
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,920
It's not gonna kill him.

421
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,140
But then we switch here.

422
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,180
Yeah!

423
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,980
I

424
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,230
told you it's the strut!

425
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,490
I told you it's the tutorial!

426
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,950
I told you!

427
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,170
I told you!

428
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,750
I told you!

429
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,170
Five minutes.

430
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,970
Easy, baby.

431
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,450
I told you it would be five minutes.

432
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,490
Finally, the mother of all demons is dead.

433
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:42,010
The blood pours from your eyes as you stand in defiance.

434
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:52,830
As the only marine to endure the slaughter, you decide to remain in hell and ensure no demon ever rises again.

435
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,370
The end.

436
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,840
Thanks for the stream, I guess.

437
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,080
What now?

438
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:12,580
Oh!

439
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,780
I don't know what now.

440
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,020
Thank you for the Akasuba!

441
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,120
I didn't get to read it, though.

442
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,880
Chido-chan, thank you for the...

443
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,360
Zombieman!

444
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,500
Oh my gosh, we get the whole cast!

445
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,000
Yay!

446
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,360
Zombieman!

447
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,660
Short stream.

448
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,340
Thanks, everyone.

449
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,280
I didn't think I would be able to pull it off for the first try, though.

450
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,080
Oh!

451
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,920
Oh, I shot him!

452
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,520
Shotgun guy!

453
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,540
Shotgun guy!

454
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,780
You wanna watch me take him out?

455
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,300
Yeah!

456
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,840
Imp!

457
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,760
Oh no, he's trying to...

458
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,400
I'm gonna take him out.

459
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,620
We're gonna see his little butthole.

460
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,140
Butthole!

461
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,820
Oh god.

462
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,640
Nightmare Imp.

463
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,000
Woo!

464
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,280
I'm gonna take him out.

465
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,380
First try, first try.

466
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,560
Butthole!

467
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:09,980
Demon!

468
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,340
Call him what he's called.

469
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,540
That is a pinky.

470
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:15,960
Pinky!

471
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,680
Pro tip.

472
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,180
To defeat the mother of demons, shoot at her until she dies.

473
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,580
Like a fine-aged Parmesan.

474
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,200
I can't believe... Oh!

475
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,180
Spectre!

476
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,500
Lost!

477
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:33,720
Oh.

478
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,920
Get out of here.

479
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,020
Cocoa Demon!

480
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,040
That was awesome, Strat, but are you enough of a gamer to go for the true ending?

481
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,720
I want... Wait, what's the true ending?

482
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,780
Did I miss the tutorial?

483
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,120
It's the fastest stream ever.

484
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,140
Hell Knight!

485
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,920
First shot.

486
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,140
First try, baby.

487
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,040
Baron of Hell!

488
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,240
The loading screen took longer than the gameplay.

489
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,340
That's not true.

490
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,800
Arachnotron!

491
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,520
I like these guys a lot.

492
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,780
Pain Elemental.

493
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,360
Kill this guy.

494
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,160
Kill this guy.

495
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,800
This guy sucks.

496
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,300
Stupid Meatball.

497
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,720
Mancubus!

498
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,780
The way they die is so nasty.

499
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,660
The Cyber Demon!

500
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,040
Me!

501
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,840
Hold on.

502
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,330
Our...

503
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,840
Well, guys, I do have another stream today.

504
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,280
That one will be longer.

505
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,360
I don't know what to do.

506
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,350
Wait, how do I get out of this?

507
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,650
It's the same thing again.

508
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,130
Wait, hold on.

509
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,090
I'm not Shotgun Guy.

510
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:19,710
Hold on.

511
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,630
I'm not Shotgun Guy.

512
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:21,870
Karaoke?

513
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,210
Okay.

514
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,830
We can do karaoke.

515
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,950
Karaoke.

516
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:28,870
What do I do?

517
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,860
How do I leave?

518
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,620
Main menu?

519
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,860
This re-release has a few new bonus levels that serve as a precursor to DOOM 2016 if you want a few more levels to play.

520
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,200
How do I get to those?

521
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,950
I thought Mint was stuck in the game.

522
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,290
Do I just leave?

523
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,030
Oh, password.

524
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,750
Quit the main menu for now?

525
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:06,990
Okay.

526
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,690
Pro gamer Minto, looking forward to DOOM 3 when you feel up to it.

527
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,190
Thanks!

528
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,510
I go to options, right?

529
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,050
For the passwords?

530
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,290
Yeah.

531
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,370
What's under more?

532
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,170
Oh, nope.

533
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:23,790
Under password.

534
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,890
It's six maps, if I remember correctly.

535
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,090
Oh, new game?

536
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:29,910
I have to do new game?

537
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,910
Oh, the lost levels.

538
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:41,570
Okay, since I did say I will do karaoke, I'll do... maybe... what?

539
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:42,250
There's six of them?

540
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,810
Maybe I won't do all of them?

541
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,030
But, uh...

542
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,750
You cheesed so fast that you beat the boss before I got a yummy spin box.

543
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,610
Good job, boss.

544
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,910
Share some of that cheese to us.

545
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,390
We're hungry.

546
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,160
Hmm.

547
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,700
Karaoke while playing the lost levels.

548
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,760
Let's just do... I did bring it on before, right?

549
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,340
So...

550
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,380
We'll just do the same.

551
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,260
Oh, no.

552
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,900
I don't have anything.

553
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:15,940
Uh...

554
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,840
I have nothing and nowhere to go.

555
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,780
Wow!

556
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,000
Thank you for the Hakka Super!

557
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,060
Karaoke sounds great.

558
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,720
I love the idea of someone turning in for a final boss tutorial and hearing, Giddy Giddy I!

559
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,140
Hey, hey!

560
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,580
Die, die!

561
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,860
Die, die!

562
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,840
Die, die, die now.

563
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,280
Yeah, we'll do karaoke.

564
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh my goodness.

565
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,360
Woo!

566
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,220
Hey!

567
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,160
Chill out!

568
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,260
Let's grab that.

569
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,800
I just opened something.

570
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,840
Giddy Giddy I!

571
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,340
You can hide by the line.

572
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,940
Giddy Giddy I!

573
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,820
Having the better shotgun.

574
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,160
Oh!

575
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,360
I heard someone else.

576
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,680
I think I heard him.

577
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,160
And him.

578
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,220
Grab everything.

579
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:11,940
Where...

580
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,140
That guy.

581
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,640
Giddy Giddy I!

582
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,840
You can hide...

583
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,620
By the... Hello?

584
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,380
By the line!

585
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,800
Well, it... I mean, seriously?

586
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
It was like a tutorial for real.

587
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,200
I think people could actually watch my stream.

588
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,980
And be like, so that's how you beat it.

589
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,440
So...

590
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,780
So funny.

591
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,060
How that...

592
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,400
Aim...

593
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,100
So funny how that just kind of turned out like that.

594
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,320
But I only know because I watched a guy do it.

595
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Wait, can I open this?

596
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,180
No.

597
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,340
I watched this some guy and he was like really good.

598
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,860
Well, I hear someone going...

599
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,340
Where do I go?

600
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,920
Sorry if I'm like zooming through here.

601
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,600
Maybe I go through here.

602
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,020
Oh!

603
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,420
Oh!

604
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,300
I don't want to go here yet.

605
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,860
I don't think.

606
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,260
Trim and reupload the stream.

607
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:14,940
For real!

608
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,260
Oh!

609
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,420
Secret!

610
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,560
Is this level zero?

611
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
To be honest, I couldn't tell you.

612
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:23,860
Oh!

613
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,320
Oh!

614
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,900
Secret?

615
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,680
Maybe not secret.

616
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,380
Secret?

617
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,340
Secret?

618
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,920
Where are you?

619
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,660
I hear you in there.

620
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,280
I hear him.

621
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,960
He's moaning and groaning.

622
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,080
That was the classic boomer era.

623
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,380
I glitched the boss strut.

624
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,960
I can't believe it.

625
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,660
I seriously thought like it would take me a couple tries.

626
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,220
But it was just...

627
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,300
It just happened.

628
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,300
I told you guys.

629
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,640
I was...

630
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,240
I cheesed.

631
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,660
Oh!

632
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,300
Okay.

633
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:57,660
Oh!

634
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,830
Ouch!

635
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,430
Ouch!

636
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,670
Ouch!

637
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:04,810
Ouch!

638
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:04,950
Ouch!

639
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,990
I don't know if I'm supposed to be going this way or what.

640
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:09,650
Oh!

641
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,130
Here we go.

642
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:10,650
Alright.

643
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,390
Oh!

644
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:15,630
Gosh!

645
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,030
Oh!

646
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,550
There are pain elementals in here.

647
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,450
Or lost souls, I mean.

648
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:21,810
Ah!

649
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,130
Shoot!

650
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,210
Okay.

651
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,030
Yeah.

652
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:27,970
Oh!

653
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,690
Not today, sir.

654
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:31,810
Oh.

655
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:32,090
No.

656
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:32,810
That's the wrong thing.

657
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,470
This one.

658
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,670
Always love watching your streams on Kik.

659
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:40,750
Yeah.

660
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,170
That's me.

661
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,130
Notorious Kik streamer.

662
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,350
Wait.

663
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:44,670
Okay.

664
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:44,930
So...

665
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:45,070
Oh!

666
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:45,430
This is...

667
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,970
This is what opens.

668
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,110
Oh my god.

669
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:48,450
Pinkie!

670
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:49,550
Ah!

671
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,410
Yeah.

672
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:50,590
Oh.

673
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:51,570
Uh.

674
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,710
I messed up.

675
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:55,490
Yeah.

676
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:55,950
Come back.

677
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,350
Idiot.

678
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:57,970
Idiot.

679
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,350
Idiot.

680
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:01,590
Idiot.

681
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,250
Idiot.

682
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,070
Idiot.

683
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:03,830
Idiot.

684
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,220
Idiot.

685
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,010
Idiot.

686
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:05,810
Idiot.

687
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:05,850
Idiot.

688
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:06,670
Idiot.

689
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:06,690
Idiot.

690
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:06,710
Idiot.

691
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:06,830
Idiot.

692
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:06,970
Idiot.

693
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,530
Idiot.

694
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,370
Idiot.

695
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,330
Idiot.

696
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:09,610
Idiot.

697
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,030
Idiot.

698
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,370
I just killed.

699
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,670
I always... I just kill.

700
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,310
I just kill!

701
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,090
Any secrets?

702
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,890
Take some clips.

703
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,370
Stop shooting at me from everywhere!

704
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,330
Oh my god, from literally every angle.

705
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,230
Chill out!

706
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,310
Chill out!

707
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,970
I'm gonna run out of bullets at this rate.

708
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,350
I'm gonna die at this rate.

709
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,890
Can we calm down?

710
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,570
Time to snipe with a shotgun.

711
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,930
As usual.

712
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,050
Where did you guys come from too?

713
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,850
Stop shooting at me.

714
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,340
Everybody's ridiculous.

715
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,080
We need more bullets.

716
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,100
We need more bullets!

717
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,280
I can't snipe from here, I think, you guys.

718
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,300
I think it's a lost cause.

719
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,380
Well, I say that, but you know, it's Doom.

720
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,340
It's Doom.

721
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,920
This level looks fancy.

722
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,440
Yeah, it does look kinda fancy.

723
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,060
Are those the guys that were shooting at me, I think?

724
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,900
Red card.

725
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:37,860
Ah!

726
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:39,880
Yeah!

727
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,280
Yeah!

728
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,360
Yeah!

729
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,600
Yeah!

730
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,420
Uh-oh.

731
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,280
Uh-oh.

732
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,320
I'm gonna be out of bullets real soon.

733
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,380
Uh-oh.

734
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,680
Uh-oh.

735
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,700
Uh-oh, I need to use my fir- I'm stuck on the wall!

736
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,500
Uh-oh, I have to use my fists!

737
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,500
Uh-oh.

738
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,980
Oh, wait, wait.

739
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,020
Oh, thank goodness, thank goodness.

740
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,980
I could've punched him.

741
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,000
I think I could've taken him out.

742
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,840
I could've punched him.

743
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,340
That guy dropped a shotgun?

744
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,300
Which one?

745
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,880
Oh, this guy?

746
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,800
Oh, thank you.

747
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,180
Yeah.

748
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,460
Legends are true.

749
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,520
Mint guy is real.

750
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,400
Rip and tear!

751
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,820
RIP AND TEAR!

752
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,400
No secret.

753
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:24,940
No?

754
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,620
No secret?

755
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,400
Um...

756
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,720
I didn't think he'd be camping.

757
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,720
Ew.

758
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,060
Oh!

759
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,460
Anyway...

760
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,880
That's fancy.

761
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,040
Pinky.

762
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,760
Pinky jump scare.

763
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,100
Is this level supposed to just not give you anything?

764
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,240
Is that why it's, it's, uh, you know...

765
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,460
Is that why it's so...

766
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,140
Oh my gosh.

767
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:03,740
Oh my goodness.

768
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,020
Is that why it's a harder level?

769
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,860
They just don't...

770
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,900
You can't punch people.

771
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,900
Yes, I can, Jackie!

772
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,320
Oh, come on.

773
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,400
Have some more faith in me.

774
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,340
Have some more faith in me.

775
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,170
Give me stuff?

776
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,870
Give me nothing.

777
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,290
Yes, queen, give me nothing.

778
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,510
Nice.

779
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,150
Ooh!

780
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:34,790
Ooh.

781
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,690
Hit hard.

782
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:39,590
Um...

783
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,670
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

784
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,910
Yes, give me everything.

785
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,480
Got him.

786
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,300
Easy peasy.

787
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,440
Lemon squeezy, everybody.

788
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,200
No worries here.

789
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,300
But like I said, since I did say I'll do karaoke...

790
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,800
Um, and...

791
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,000
Honestly, I guess the stream doesn't need to be too long because I, uh...

792
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,860
Wait, where was the blue door?

793
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,480
I don't even remember.

794
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,820
Doesn't need to be too long since I...

795
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,520
Uh...

796
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,660
Have done everything.

797
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:19,640
Um...

798
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:20,740
Uh...

799
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,380
Well, not everything.

800
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:22,840
You know what I mean.

801
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,600
Um...

802
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,240
We'll just do maybe a level or two or something and then...

803
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,480
Um...

804
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Then we can...

805
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,280
Then I'll do...

806
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,700
Then I'll sing.

807
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,100
Oh!

808
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,720
Oh, no.

809
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,960
That was the secret door I went through.

810
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,500
Um...

811
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,920
Where was the blue?

812
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,480
Oh, I'm berserk.

813
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,820
I'm berserking out.

814
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,620
I'm berserking out.

815
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,260
Final boss, good luck, man.

816
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:47,740
Oh!

817
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,740
Thanks!

818
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,020
I needed it then.

819
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,400
I don't need it now.

820
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,060
What am I hearing?

821
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,650
Where do I go?

822
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,210
Am I...

823
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,730
Where's the blue door?

824
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,770
Am I crazy?

825
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,790
Did you guys see a blue door?

826
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,290
It wasn't down here?

827
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,570
Does he know?

828
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,690
Wait, what do I know?

829
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,210
Oh!

830
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:19,970
Um...

831
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,390
Uh...

832
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:23,610
Q.

833
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,070
Is it that over there?

834
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,150
That bright light?

835
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:32,790
Oh!

836
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,350
You are crazy, yes.

837
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,010
I'm crazy good at the game.

838
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,430
Oh, maybe through here.

839
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,490
Oh, hello.

840
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,230
Why are you in here?

841
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,680
Oh, my God.

842
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,540
Why are you both in here?

843
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,360
Where did you guys come from?

844
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:07,630
Maybe...

845
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,930
Oh, maybe it's down there.

846
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,990
Eating Mike Tyson's butt.

847
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:14,630
Thank you.

848
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,650
Thank you for the...

849
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:18,970
Gifted...

850
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,070
Is it down here?

851
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:20,870
Let's try it.

852
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,470
Let's check this out.

853
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,190
Oh, I got the super shotgun.

854
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,430
Wait, how do I get back up?

855
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,150
Oh, it's like that.

856
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,590
The legend.

857
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:37,830
Guys?

858
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,130
I think I have no idea.

859
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,930
Wait, there's a door right there.

860
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,210
What?

861
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:46,570
What?

862
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,310
Looks like you need to raise that bridge.

863
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,630
Yeah, I didn't...

864
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,830
I don't think I missed a...

865
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,750
Oh, maybe it's timed here, right?

866
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,770
No, it's on, right?

867
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,010
Yeah, it's on.

868
00:32:59,270 --> 00:32:59,670
Hmm.

869
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,730
I didn't think I missed anything.

870
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,810
I'm lost as well.

871
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,050
Is there a switch here that I...

872
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,210
Didn't see?

873
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,810
Might be.

874
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:14,910
Switch here?

875
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,370
No.

876
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:16,570
Okay.

877
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,470
Oh.

878
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,510
Now I'm all the way back at the beginning.

879
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,670
Another switch panel.

880
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:25,650
Oh.

881
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:26,890
Oh.

882
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:27,630
Oh.

883
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,010
Oh.

884
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:28,270
Oh.

885
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:28,810
Oh.

886
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,230
Oh.

887
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:29,370
Oh.

888
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:29,690
Oh.

889
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:29,770
Oh.

890
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:29,830
Oh.

891
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:29,870
Oh.

892
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:30,090
Oh.

893
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:31,630
Oh.

894
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:46,810
Another adventure.

895
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,330
Well, we found the blue door, you guys.

896
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:51,530
Aww.

897
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:53,770
Aww.

898
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,690
We lost...

899
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:57,050
Here.

900
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:57,590
Shotgun.

901
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,450
Shotgun.

902
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:58,950
Good.

903
00:33:59,010 --> 00:33:59,150
Good.

904
00:33:59,170 --> 00:33:59,350
Good.

905
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,070
Can't grab yours.

906
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,290
Give me your clip.

907
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:03,410
Oh.

908
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,410
Give me your shotgun shells.

909
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:04,810
There we go.

910
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:08,770
Already dead?

911
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,610
What a loser.

912
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:12,730
Wait.

913
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,190
I think I heard a guy.

914
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,230
Did I see one over there?

915
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:17,550
No.

916
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,090
I think I'm grown.

917
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:18,610
I think I heard a guy.

918
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,690
I think I'm crazy.

919
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,730
I think I'm crazy.

920
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,430
And the yellow key.

921
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,450
Perfect.

922
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:31,770
Oh.

923
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,770
Don't shoot!

924
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,390
Oh, shoot.

925
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,290
Oh, shoot.

926
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,250
Oh, shoot.

927
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,350
Oh, shoot.

928
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,370
Oh, shoot.

929
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,430
Oh, shoot.

930
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,330
Fine!

931
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:45,510
Thanks for the 10!

932
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,530
Thank you so much.

933
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,490
Bye!

934
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:48,610
OK.

935
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,750
What keeps... oh, I got you.

936
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,130
I got it.

937
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,570
Easy peasy.

938
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,010
Did you take your meds?

939
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:02,970
No.

940
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,410
That's what I have to say about that.

941
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,390
Taking my meds.

942
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,090
Oh, rockets.

943
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,130
Taking my meds.

944
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:21,890
Now we go back to this room.

945
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,430
Who just entered?

946
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,170
Did I kill him?

947
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,430
I don't think I did.

948
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,550
What if I just blast him?

949
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,730
Who is that in there?

950
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,310
Oh, I can't blast him.

951
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,230
Okay, let's just run.

952
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,670
This is more than I bargained for!

953
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,750
Why is there a Baron of Hell all of a sudden?

954
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,030
Oh,

955
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:13,770
no!

956
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,570
They were right there!

957
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:20,130
Oh my... oof, oof, oof.

958
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:20,530
Oh my gosh.

959
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,970
Oh my gosh, I get stuck up on the walls so easily.

960
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,650
Stop it!

961
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,550
Who is still aiming at me?

962
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,830
Oh, I don't have any bullets here.

963
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,430
Oh, gosh.

964
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,030
Oh, gosh.

965
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,470
Hit the thing!

966
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,790
Oh my god, there's more of them.

967
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:53,470
Ah!

968
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:54,830
Ah!

969
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,070
I'm out of bullets.

970
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,970
I can only rocket launch!

971
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,570
I can only rocket launch!

972
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,330
Oh my god.

973
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,350
Yippee!

974
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,050
Rocket launch!

975
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:10,570
Nope.

976
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,210
Not today.

977
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,130
Not today.

978
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,010
Oh my god, I think they're too far away.

979
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,470
If I try and... Oh my god.

980
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,830
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

981
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,630
Oh, this is such a mess.

982
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,590
Get him!

983
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,670
How did you take a rocket to the face?

984
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,910
Oh my god.

985
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,710
You can also punch them.

986
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,810
They're behind the bars.

987
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:42,730
There's this guy.

988
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,150
I think I got him.

989
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,570
This guy.

990
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,590
Death.

991
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,270
This guy.

992
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,530
Maybe death.

993
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,330
Nice rocket.

994
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,950
I only have A left.

995
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,510
Okay, I think I got him.

996
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,890
Oh, I picked up shotgun shells.

997
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:07,890
Somewhere.

998
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:10,890
Yippee!

999
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,690
Oh, more rockets!

1000
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,810
Maybe they do love me.

1001
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,610
Who just entered the room?

1002
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:20,710
Not anymore.

1003
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,810
How is this level more stressful than the last level?

1004
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,650
They just always exceed my expectations, you know?

1005
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,690
Wait, is that a guy over there?

1006
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,470
No, he's not moving.

1007
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,290
Okay, let's go.

1008
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,410
Exit.

1009
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,190
Wait, what's this?

1010
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:38,910
Nothing.

1011
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,430
This?

1012
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:39,910
Nothing.

1013
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,530
Holy moly.

1014
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,050
Bye!

1015
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,550
Yippee!

1016
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,630
Peter, thanks for the membership.

1017
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:58,470
Thank you!

1018
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,830
20% secrets.

1019
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,070
Oh my god, should I kill him?

1020
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,150
Should I take him out?

1021
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,350
Take him out from behind his back?

1022
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,290
It's so sad.

1023
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,970
Look at that butt.

1024
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,570
Look at that butt!

1025
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,890
That's an imp!

1026
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,410
That's an imp we're ogling right now.

1027
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,830
And a butthole.

1028
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,170
How do I get out of here?

1029
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,330
Like, just like that.

1030
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:43,590
Don't try me.

1031
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,790
No, do not try me.

1032
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,130
I'm a different ghost.

1033
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,850
I've beat the mother demon.

1034
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,030
I cheese the mother demon.

1035
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,570
Do not!

1036
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,530
Save?

1037
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,890
I guess we can save.

1038
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,830
We'll save over level 21.

1039
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,730
Wait, oh, no.

1040
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,190
What does this count as?

1041
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:09,710
Level...

1042
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,850
35!

1043
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,890
I hear them.

1044
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,530
I hear them.

1045
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,010
I hear them.

1046
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,230
I hear them doing their ugly whispers.

1047
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,310
Wait, was there something here?

1048
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,310
Yeah, a chain gun.

1049
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,520
Yeah, take that.

1050
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,400
Now take that.

1051
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,320
They're whispering about me?

1052
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,640
They're just...

1053
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,560
Oh.

1054
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:47,620
Oh.

1055
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:47,980
Oh my god.

1056
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,460
Oh my god.

1057
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:48,820
Oh my god.

1058
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,520
Oh my god.

1059
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,460
Oh god.

1060
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:50,620
Oh god.

1061
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,400
Oh god.

1062
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:53,960
Oh god.

1063
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,880
I see you.

1064
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,600
Over there.

1065
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,240
He's just like, oh, I'm here, too.

1066
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,560
I'm late for the party.

1067
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,240
Baby.

1068
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:06,880
Nice moves.

1069
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:07,940
Bing you.

1070
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,080
Is there anything here?

1071
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,360
Why is there just a random...

1072
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,460
All right.

1073
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,040
Oh!

1074
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:14,700
Ow!

1075
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,600
How did that miss?

1076
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:24,990
We got him.

1077
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:26,710
Gaming.

1078
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,570
Gaming everybody.

1079
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,690
Gaming.

1080
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,110
Minto gaming.

1081
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,610
Everybody remember.

1082
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,590
Minto gaming.

1083
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,220
I hear somebody.

1084
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,380
So as soon as we get up here, I know there's gonna be some whispering.

1085
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,600
Who is there?

1086
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,020
Minto gaming.

1087
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,180
Obama?

1088
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,100
What?

1089
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,620
He has nothing to do with this.

1090
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,280
He's not taking my credit.

1091
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,600
Maybe it was them.

1092
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,520
Maybe they were the whispers.

1093
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,020
How do I get this armor?

1094
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,980
Super shotgun.

1095
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,640
Okay, okay, okay.

1096
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,660
I heard it.

1097
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,140
I heard it.

1098
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,960
Run, run, run!

1099
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,400
Yippee!

1100
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,240
Secret.

1101
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,820
Electric berry.

1102
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,060
Is it him?

1103
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,140
Was it you?

1104
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,220
No.

1105
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:46,980
There's more.

1106
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,560
Oh.

1107
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,360
There they are.

1108
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,000
Uh oh.

1109
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,980
Who just came out?

1110
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,240
Who just came out?

1111
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:12,860
More of them.

1112
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,340
Ow!

1113
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:13,880
God.

1114
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,340
In fight.

1115
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,300
Yeah, in fight.

1116
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,020
You dummies.

1117
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:17,940
Oh my God.

1118
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,420
There's so much happening here.

1119
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:23,560
What?

1120
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,540
There's a spider too?

1121
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,580
Oh.

1122
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,620
He killed him.

1123
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,200
He killed him.

1124
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,220
Okay, okay.

1125
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,480
I can take him out.

1126
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,240
I can take him out.

1127
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,760
Probably.

1128
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,540
That was a little overkill, but you know.

1129
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:53,720
Nice.

1130
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,700
They're giving me energy things, but I don't have an energy gun.

1131
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,220
Where's my energy gun?

1132
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,000
Oh!

1133
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,880
Spider squished.

1134
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,040
Poor little spider.

1135
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,320
I need more shotgun shells though.

1136
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,460
Oh, box.

1137
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,260
Boxel.

1138
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,160
What did that open up?

1139
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,060
Anything?

1140
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:21,980
Oh.

1141
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,100
I'll take that.

1142
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:23,780
I'll take that.

1143
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,220
Oh, here, here, here.

1144
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:26,560
Nice.

1145
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,860
They say choose one.

1146
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:30,440
No!

1147
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,300
This is so unfair!

1148
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:35,460
Do you want the blueberry or do you want the plasma gun?

1149
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:36,980
No!

1150
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,180
This is so unfair!

1151
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,420
It was my birthday a few weeks ago.

1152
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,360
Well, happy few weeks ago birthday!

1153
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,040
The ADHD agenda?

1154
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,180
Is that what your name is?

1155
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,780
Wait, or did that say head?

1156
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,800
The head agenda.

1157
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,680
The ha- agenda.

1158
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,080
There's a spider behind you.

1159
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,260
No!

1160
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,000
Blueberry all the way.

1161
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,920
Oh, we could get a new gun.

1162
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,570
This is unfair.

1163
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,050
Why are you making me choose?

1164
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,230
Only blueberry.

1165
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:12,490
Wait.

1166
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:14,550
Yubi!

1167
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,030
So unfair.

1168
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:20,990
Okay.

1169
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,450
Oh, this opened up.

1170
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,270
The lighting in here is a little freaky, right?

1171
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,310
Take those rockets.

1172
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,570
Wait, can I run from here to get that blueberry, I wonder?

1173
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:41,450
Oh!

1174
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:43,010
I got invisibility!

1175
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,590
Oh, that's what that did.

1176
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:46,290
Fun?

1177
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:47,430
Oh, wait.

1178
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:48,030
What?

1179
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:49,350
Is something lower?

1180
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:52,670
What's the point of having invisibility if I don't know where to go?

1181
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:57,990
Hold on.

1182
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:02,390
One second.

1183
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,350
I opened- I activated something.

1184
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:07,490
And...

1185
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:08,790
Is it over there?

1186
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:09,410
Maybe it's here.

1187
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,730
I'm partially...

1188
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,830
Invisible.

1189
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:16,250
Don't bother me.

1190
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:16,870
Oh, here.

1191
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,130
You can't see me!

1192
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,110
How can you see me?!

1193
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,050
Oh my gosh.

1194
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,340
You can't see me.

1195
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,280
I'm John Cena.

1196
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,220
I'm John Cena!

1197
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:31,820
I'm John Cena!

1198
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,260
It's only partial.

1199
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,920
No, no, it's real.

1200
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,320
It's 100%.

1201
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:41,960
It's 100%.

1202
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,220
Believe, believe, believe.

1203
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:46,680
Nice.

1204
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,040
How do I...

1205
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,820
That's how I do it.

1206
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,940
That's how I do it.

1207
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,940
Or maybe not.

1208
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,640
Oh, God.

1209
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:02,500
Oh, God!

1210
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,960
Don't open the door, you guys.

1211
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,180
It's scary out there.

1212
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,980
Just don't open the door.

1213
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:21,370
I should have changed the chain gun.

1214
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:22,670
Anybody else?

1215
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:23,790
Anybody else?

1216
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:30,790
They're like, Haha, you thought it was that lever because it's yellow and the key is yellow.

1217
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,090
But no, it is this lever over here.

1218
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:35,270
Dummy.

1219
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,150
Get played.

1220
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,410
Howdy, Mintopia.

1221
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,110
Have a nice day.

1222
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:40,770
Thank you, Dean.

1223
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:43,070
Thank you so much.

1224
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,670
Oh, I don't have the red key.

1225
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:47,290
I'm dumb.

1226
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:47,910
I knew that.

1227
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,130
I knew that.

1228
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:49,550
I knew that.

1229
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:52,250
Yellow.

1230
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:52,690
Yellow.

1231
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,010
Those tricky level designers.

1232
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,150
The demons kind of know what's up.

1233
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:02,510
But also, how do they, like, get anything done?

1234
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:03,530
You know?

1235
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:05,370
Wait, I'm stuck.

1236
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:06,730
How do they...

1237
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:09,130
Where was yellow again?

1238
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:11,710
Oh, I remember.

1239
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,190
Hi John Cena.

1240
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,250
I loved you on Bubble Bee and Suicide Squad.

1241
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,270
Hope you have fun hosting Shark Week.

1242
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,710
Yes, I knew that I was hosting that.

1243
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,590
Thanks for letting me know.

1244
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:28,930
Ouch.

1245
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:29,730
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1246
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,730
Yeah, get stun-locked, dummy.

1247
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:41,510
There's more over here.

1248
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:41,990
Whoa!

1249
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,090
Whoa!

1250
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:47,850
Yeah, get stun-locked, dummy.

1251
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:49,730
Okay.

1252
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,090
What's in this area now?

1253
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,110
Take all your bullets.

1254
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,430
Energy cell for a plasma gun that I forfeited.

1255
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,070
Good luck, mint chip.

1256
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,190
Thanks!

1257
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:08,690
What's this one?

1258
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,170
Maybe it's a...

1259
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:11,270
What's the word?

1260
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:16,150
Rockets.

1261
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:17,750
How do I...

1262
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:19,490
Hold on.

1263
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:20,450
I think I'm...

1264
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:21,630
Oh, here we go.

1265
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:25,190
Wow.

1266
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,770
There wasn't an enemy immediately?

1267
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,790
As soon as I walked in?

1268
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:31,990
Oh!

1269
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:34,990
Oh my god!

1270
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,350
The spitter!

1271
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:36,750
Damn it!

1272
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,090
The spitter was right here the whole time.

1273
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:41,310
Blue!

1274
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:43,710
Come on.

1275
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,090
There has to be something.

1276
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:49,490
You.

1277
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:50,090
No.

1278
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:52,490
That looks like a trap.

1279
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,130
That looks like a trap.

1280
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:13,750
Where's the next one?

1281
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:16,490
What?

1282
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,290
I keep putting it.

1283
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:18,430
Weakest trap ever.

1284
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,310
Too easy.

1285
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,170
Five out of ten.

1286
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:23,470
Five out of ten.

1287
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:23,630
Oh.

1288
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:24,010
Yeah.

1289
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:24,610
We want this one.

1290
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,350
Too easy to determine that it was a trap, you know?

1291
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,110
I called it from a mile away.

1292
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,470
Whoever designed that one, it was like their first day on the job.

1293
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,350
They were like, what if we let...

1294
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:35,830
What if we...

1295
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,550
What if it was like a little candy?

1296
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:38,490
Like a...

1297
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:39,810
You follow the armor.

1298
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:42,410
You'd be like, oh yeah, I have to get the armor.

1299
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:43,970
Oh, what am I on this one?

1300
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:45,030
Ah!

1301
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,770
Maybe it was his second day.

1302
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,110
Oh my god.

1303
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,450
There's another spider in here.

1304
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:53,630
Spider demon!

1305
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,140
Ooh, piece of candy.

1306
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,960
Ooh, piece of candy.

1307
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,300
Ooh, piece of candy.

1308
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,820
I just keep following it and...

1309
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:10,740
Haha.

1310
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,680
Not just one spider demon, but two.

1311
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,840
And then three.

1312
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:16,800
Oh my god.

1313
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,480
They're doing...

1314
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,120
This guy.

1315
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,600
They want me to be on this side.

1316
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:28,900
Oh.

1317
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:29,480
Okay.

1318
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,120
Are you sure?

1319
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,120
Okay.

1320
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,700
What a...

1321
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,540
Oh my god!

1322
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,320
Oh my god.

1323
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:42,660
Oh my god!

1324
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,280
Oh my god!

1325
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:43,720
Oh my god!

1326
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:43,800
Oh my god!

1327
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:47,420
Oh...

1328
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:48,400
Ouch.

1329
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,060
Ouch.

1330
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,380
I think I got him.

1331
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,260
But there was...

1332
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,500
This guy.

1333
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,580
With the long hair...

1334
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:58,800
Don't do it.

1335
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,060
Don't you do it.

1336
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,300
Don't you...

1337
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,120
I don't always see them.

1338
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,080
I don't want to see your ugly faces.

1339
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,240
I don't want to see your ugly faces.

1340
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:04,820
I don't want to see them.

1341
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,280
I don't want to see them.

1342
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,780
I can't tell if I'm getting him or not.

1343
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,260
What is this?

1344
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,660
What is going on?

1345
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,440
Oh my god, there's several of them.

1346
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,280
There's several of them.

1347
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,220
Can we all like fight each other, you know?

1348
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,440
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1349
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,140
He's coming in here.

1350
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,280
You see, you're not allowed in.

1351
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,020
This is private property.

1352
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,380
Did I get them both?

1353
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,620
Nope.

1354
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,220
Oh my god.

1355
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,500
Oh, he's still here?

1356
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:53,980
Okay.

1357
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,580
Something opened.

1358
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,600
But what?

1359
00:52:59,140 --> 00:52:59,900
Here?

1360
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,740
Oh, wait.

1361
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:10,710
How am I supposed to reach that?

1362
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:16,680
Interesting.

1363
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,120
Oh, maybe from back here?

1364
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:19,400
No.

1365
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,580
Aim up.

1366
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,700
Okay, sorry.

1367
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:24,940
Super shotgun?

1368
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:31,520
No.

1369
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,400
Jump.

1370
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,640
That's my favorite mechanic in Doom.

1371
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,240
Being able to jump, you know?

1372
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,500
Really great thing that they added.

1373
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,240
A raised platform.

1374
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,620
It's over... it's right here, right?

1375
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,460
Yeah, I can see it.

1376
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:47,900
I can see...

1377
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,240
I don't see where there's a raised platform, though.

1378
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,120
Don't see it.

1379
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,260
No!

1380
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,110
Use the rocket.

1381
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,450
What, for the splash damage?

1382
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:06,470
I don't know.

1383
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:07,430
Strange.

1384
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:10,530
It's a little peculiar of a button.

1385
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:12,610
Did I get all of them?

1386
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:12,810
Yeah.

1387
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:15,570
Trying to make sure I got every, like, weapon or...

1388
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:17,430
All the stuff stuff.

1389
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:18,030
Hmm.

1390
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:18,710
Second floor.

1391
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:19,090
Oh, see?

1392
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,450
Missed that shotgun.

1393
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,670
Okay.

1394
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:25,790
Huh.

1395
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,430
You can jump in the newer ones.

1396
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:30,610
That's very true.

1397
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:32,110
They did include that.

1398
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:33,830
Have I gone through here?

1399
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:37,490
I don't know if I have.

1400
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:39,710
I must have, right?

1401
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:40,810
Oh, yeah.

1402
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:41,990
I just missed that rocket.

1403
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:42,870
Oh, yeah.

1404
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:44,410
Cause that's where the line of...

1405
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,050
Of the thingies were.

1406
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:48,930
Yeah, I want that.

1407
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:49,670
I see the weapon.

1408
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:51,850
Is that the BFG?

1409
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:56,890
Hmm...

1410
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:57,590
Oh, yeah.

1411
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:58,530
A little candy trail.

1412
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:05,070
I wonder if I needed to have gotten it when this platform was...

1413
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,050
I think I missed my chance.

1414
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,070
Because this platform was raised.

1415
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,330
I think I missed my chance.

1416
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:12,350
No!

1417
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:12,470
No!

1418
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,470
Dang.

1419
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:16,850
Wait.

1420
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:17,470
Oh, there.

1421
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:18,050
Uh-oh.

1422
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:21,750
Wait.

1423
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,990
No.

1424
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:25,230
Which is open.

1425
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:27,890
Oh, wait!

1426
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:28,270
Oh!

1427
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:29,270
Now we can do it!

1428
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:29,810
Now we can do it!

1429
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:30,350
Now we can do it!

1430
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:31,810
Right?

1431
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:35,550
Yes, yes, yes!

1432
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:38,830
Hey.

1433
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:39,270
Open up.

1434
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:45,370
Yippee!

1435
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:46,790
Okay.

1436
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:47,590
We got it.

1437
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:50,010
Now...

1438
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:50,830
We have...

1439
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:51,670
What did we just grab?

1440
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:52,210
The red key?

1441
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,050
I don't remember where those were at.

1442
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:58,610
The red key.

1443
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:01,190
Well, not here, obviously.

1444
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:04,590
Uh...

1445
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,770
We go...

1446
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:06,530
This way?

1447
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:07,650
Yeah.

1448
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:09,130
Yellow key.

1449
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:11,470
Maybe in here?

1450
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:16,730
Have you been here the whole time?

1451
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:19,390
No.

1452
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:20,670
I think you just spawned, right?

1453
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:26,210
Grab all these clips.

1454
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,210
As much as we can.

1455
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:30,810
I'm running around.

1456
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,010
The speed of sound.

1457
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:34,810
And he was bored later.

1458
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,990
Where was...

1459
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:38,430
Was it...

1460
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:38,670
Oh.

1461
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:39,970
I don't think that.

1462
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:42,250
Where was...

1463
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:44,090
It was in here, maybe.

1464
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:44,190
Maybe.

1465
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:46,790
No...

1466
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:46,950
Oh.

1467
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:47,450
Yes.

1468
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:51,010
Uh-oh.

1469
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,210
That's a lost soul.

1470
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:54,190
Maybe.

1471
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,670
Oh, you guys are jailed because you're all...

1472
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:01,650
You all got caught.

1473
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,350
That makes you really lame and stupid.

1474
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:06,570
How did you live that?

1475
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,550
Only idiots get caught and put in jail.

1476
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,510
You guys just weren't good enough.

1477
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:16,310
Oh, shit.

1478
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:17,530
Oh, it's a bear to help.

1479
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:18,970
Oh, no.

1480
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:21,790
Oh, no.

1481
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:23,710
Oh, no.

1482
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,130
Oh, oh, oh.

1483
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,230
Oh, oh, oh.

1484
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:28,030
I got him.

1485
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,690
I got his butt.

1486
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:31,930
Oh, no.

1487
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:34,990
And then as soon as I press this button, we're going to all lower.

1488
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,570
And the whole army is going to come out.

1489
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:39,970
I hear them all.

1490
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:41,530
Oh, no.

1491
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:43,690
Can I get them from here?

1492
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:46,550
Nice.

1493
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:47,750
Oh, my gosh.

1494
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:48,510
Where did you come from?

1495
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,690
It's like, I've been around.

1496
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:58,290
I've been around.

1497
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:11,250
Let's see if we can get these guys because they will surely gang up on us along with other guys.

1498
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:13,530
Hello?

1499
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:14,130
Hello?

1500
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:16,250
Please get out of my way.

1501
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,090
Maybe that was the last one.

1502
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:18,970
Maybe that was the last one.

1503
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:20,990
OK.

1504
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,120
That's timed.

1505
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,640
Nice.

1506
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,760
Genius.

1507
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,100
Yippee!

1508
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:47,800
Okay,

1509
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:53,900
guys.

1510
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,640
I'm gonna do a little bit of karaoke now.

1511
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:02,180
Or do you want me to do karaoke at the Chibi debut?

1512
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,760
Which would be better?

1513
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:08,220
Honestly, I have like nothing planned, so...

1514
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,180
Maybe we'll just keep this as Doom related and then we can do the karaoke...

1515
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,780
during the Chibi debut.

1516
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:18,620
Both!

1517
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:20,640
Look at you.

1518
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,320
You're so selfish.

1519
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,040
Just kidding.

1520
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,320
You want your cake and you want to eat it too.

1521
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,380
This one looks sick!

1522
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,480
Look at that guy over there!

1523
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,640
What a warm welcome.

1524
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,860
I want to keep playing.

1525
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:37,540
I will save.

1526
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,140
Maybe I'll play these off stream.

1527
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:43,160
Maybe I'll finish these levels off stream.

1528
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,860
Or maybe one day if I'm feeling bored, I'll just stream them.

1529
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:47,320
You know, whatever.

1530
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,720
But this level has a really cool look.

1531
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:57,720
I would keep going, but like I said, I have another stream in one hour.

1532
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,680
And I would like to eat before then.

1533
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:05,840
