00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,400
Hello!

2
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,280
Sorry!

3
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,720
Sorry it took so long!

4
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,100
Sorry!

5
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,300
Hello everybody!

6
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:36,880
Welcome back!

7
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,720
Hello!

8
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,640
Welcome to...

9
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,980
Duck Detective!

10
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,080
Duck Detective!

11
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,160
Duck... Detective...

12
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,380
Duck Detective...

13
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,040
I'm watching while on the toilet.

14
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,200
Don't tell my boss, Teehee!

15
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,440
Your secret is safe with me.

16
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,040
What the duck is going on?

17
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,340
There's all sorts of ducking and going on in here.

18
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,940
We're solving a quacking case today, everybody!

19
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,420
What the quack?

20
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,760
What the quack?

21
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,600
Detective Mint solves the case of the crying wisp.

22
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,360
There's no solving that one.

23
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,830
Yes, um...

24
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:40,190
Actually, I saw this game on Twitter.

25
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,250
And I was like...

26
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,710
Oh my gosh, I love detective games!

27
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,770
Good morning!

28
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:48,690
Good morning!

29
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,270
I saw this game on Twitter and I thought it looked really cute.

30
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:04,030
And actually, this is not a sponsored stream or anything But they reached out to me And they gave me a key for it, so...

31
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,850
Thank you!

32
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,270
Happy Broccoli!

33
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,170
Thank you for the key!

34
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,270
Thank you!

35
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,250
Thank you!

36
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,330
So...

37
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,950
Yeah, but...

38
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,550
I was wondering when I would play it, but...

39
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,950
Recently my throat has been pretty bad.

40
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:26,850
So...

41
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,130
I believe this game is voice acted.

42
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,690
From what I've seen.

43
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,030
So I think I'll be able to mostly just sit back and relax.

44
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,430
I think.

45
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,450
I think.

46
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,110
I saw this recently on Steam and was tempted to Supa asking you to play it.

47
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,870
Well, here we are.

48
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,650
Here we are, baby.

49
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,090
Thank you!

50
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,610
Haruka played it yesterday?

51
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,110
Oh, really?

52
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:58,970
Nice.

53
00:06:59,210 --> 00:06:59,930
Cool, cool, cool.

54
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,110
Yeah, I'm so excited.

55
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,770
It looks so fun.

56
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,090
I don't know really anything about it.

57
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,030
Well, rather, it looks very cute.

58
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,470
Hope your throat feels better soon.

59
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,090
Thank you!

60
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,330
Yeah...

61
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,210
I think... I don't know.

62
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,310
Ever since I really got sick, my throat has not really recovered.

63
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,910
So I'm hoping that while I'm in Japan...

64
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,830
I won't be talking so much.

65
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,230
So I can hopefully...

66
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,070
Rest it even a little bit, you know?

67
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,190
Oh man, you quack me up.

68
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,710
Thank you!

69
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,010
I'm ready to duck around and find out...

70
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,370
The answer to this mystery!

71
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,750
Thank you so much!

72
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,430
Thank you!

73
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,410
I'm gonna actually...

74
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,050
I'm gonna turn down the volume.

75
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,370
Even though this soundtrack is awesome.

76
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,230
What's the difference between sound volume and music volume?

77
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,830
Sound like overall volume?

78
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,580
That should be better.

79
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,900
Sound effects probably.

80
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,580
I'm gonna turn the voices down just a little bit too.

81
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,780
This so far isn't so bad.

82
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,620
But well, just in case.

83
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,400
If we can adjust anything that we need to.

84
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,240
If we need to.

85
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:30,740
Let's get into it though.

86
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,240
Because later on...

87
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,060
In a couple hours...

88
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,220
I have a meeting.

89
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,840
Which I'm very excited for.

90
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,120
Because it involves something that...

91
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,960
Matara and I are cooking a little bit.

92
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,900
For the podcast.

93
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,800
So...

94
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,680
Don't know if I can say the whole stream.

95
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,800
Pod squad.

96
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,580
But I hope you have fun with this game.

97
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,780
And hope to get a gift done for you.

98
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,700
Wait, hope to get a gift done for you.

99
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,420
In time for off guide.

100
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,420
Oh my god, Luna!

101
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,980
Thank you!

102
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,400
See you there.

103
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:04,980
So...

104
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,660
Yeah, let's just jump right into it then, right?

105
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,220
Would you like dialogue to auto advance?

106
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,480
No, no.

107
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,100
Detective mode.

108
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,500
Feel like a true detective.

109
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,200
Less information provided when incorrect.

110
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,840
Story mode.

111
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,180
A smoother experience for fledgling detectives.

112
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,780
More information provided when incorrect.

113
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,200
I don't know if you guys know this.

114
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,020
But...

115
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,520
I was once a detective.

116
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,380
I've thrown in the towel.

117
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,320
I've thrown in the hat.

118
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,840
I've thrown in the magnifying glass.

119
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,500
But...

120
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,780
Somewhere deep down in my soul.

121
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,560
Well, I am a soul.

122
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,000
Deep down in...

123
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,920
In my one soul.

124
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,840
Self.

125
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,520
Myself.

126
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,760
I still have it in me.

127
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,180
Watching you and MataMama at the same time.

128
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,840
Because I can't...

129
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,260
Well, thank you for...

130
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,840
For sticking around.

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,240
Thank you for watching both of us.

132
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,820
Mintante.

133
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,160
Made-tante.

134
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,060
Oh, made-tante is actually so good, right?

135
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,580
So, detective mode it is.

136
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,840
Life wasn't easy.

137
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,620
Oh my god.

138
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
Being cheesy.

139
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,820
I was a freshly developed detective.

140
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,460
Divorced duck.

141
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,300
Not able to pay next month's rent.

142
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,220
What do you mean?

143
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,440
Thank you.

144
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,700
What do you mean divorced?

145
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,460
Wait, hold on.

146
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,340
Can I change his audio?

147
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,280
Oh gosh.

148
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,720
Okay, we'll have to wait until...

149
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,460
He's a little loud.

150
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,940
I'm just gonna turn it down just a bit.

151
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,880
Not able to pay next month's rent.

152
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,420
Not that I had paid for it this month yet.

153
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,300
Oh no.

154
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,840
My brain felt foggy.

155
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,320
And I was trying to remember.

156
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,860
Where did all my money go?

157
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,040
Where did all my money go?

158
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,240
Where did all my money go?

159
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,040
I ask that to myself all the time.

160
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,240
I ask that to myself all the time.

161
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,160
And then I get idol merch in the mail.

162
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,960
And Metal Gear merch in the mail.

163
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,020
And I'm like, oh.

164
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,940
Divorced bro?

165
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,380
He's probably into divorce, man.

166
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,120
His voice is so good.

167
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,820
I had to retrace last night's steps.

168
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,400
Mmm.

169
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,740
Okay.

170
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,240
Deductions!

171
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,120
Are a vital part of a detective's work.

172
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,600
Find clue words by questioning persons.

173
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,580
Find clue words by questioning persons.

174
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:27,880
Thank you!

175
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,460
I don't believe you.

176
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,260
Where is your ducktective badge?

177
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,160
I wasn't a duck detective.

178
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,360
I was a detective.

179
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,340
Deduction is so good.

180
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,920
Find clue words by questioning persons Find clue words by questioning persons and inspecting your surroundings.

181
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,940
Enter clue words into blank spaces to solve deductions.

182
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,060
The nest egg.

183
00:11:53,460 --> 00:12:00,700
Probably me spent his last money on rent for blank.

184
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,600
Okay, cool.

185
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,960
Let's see.

186
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,300
Options again.

187
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,240
Voice volume a little down.

188
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,780
Okay, that should be better.

189
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,380
Sorry, I'm going to be adjusting the audio a little bit.

190
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,740
Duck Detective's wife took the eggs in the divorce.

191
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,820
Oh my god, look at him go!

192
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,200
Oh!

193
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,140
Sorry, my bad.

194
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,740
Oh my god, I'm playing Rocket League!

195
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:28,940
So cute!

196
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:31,880
Squidward!

197
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,220
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

198
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,700
Thank you!

199
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,140
I finished watching Ghost Trick at work.

200
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,380
I've been wondering if you would play...

201
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,440
AI The Somnium Files in the future.

202
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:39,940
Oh, maybe!

203
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,600
Maybe, maybe.

204
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,820
I can't believe Anna actually filed the divorce papers.

205
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,460
Anna!

206
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,040
Wait, so, tab...

207
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,420
Oh wait, I'll go back.

208
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
We have items.

209
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,940
My last money is one-ish!

210
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,300
Not enough to take a return bus trip.

211
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,820
Oh no!

212
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,540
And where are we?

213
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,700
Somewhere.

214
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,260
Okay.

215
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,320
Second overdue notice.

216
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,220
Oh my god, is Detective okay?

217
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,800
I wonder at what point they start kicking people out.

218
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,080
Oh my god.

219
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,780
Oh, this is our bed!

220
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,160
This fresh smell...

221
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,060
Oh, wait, there's bread in our bed.

222
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,600
Oh, sweet spongy loaf.

223
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,700
You keep me safe at night.

224
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,020
Bread added to clues!

225
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,460
Oh no.

226
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,180
Um, sir?

227
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,060
He sighs.

228
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,820
Wow, she's kinda hot.

229
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,960
Look at that long neck of hers.

230
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,120
Oh my god, you know what I'm obsessed with?

231
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,680
I'm obsessed with pictures of those geese that saw the meteor.

232
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,520
And how, like, they're so, like, blue and beautiful.

233
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,340
And he's, like, looking up at the sky.

234
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,360
I'm obsessed with those pictures.

235
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,340
They're so cute.

236
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,440
And now?

237
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,300
And now?

238
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,840
She doesn't even answer my texts.

239
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,580
Oh my goodness.

240
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,440
Don't be...

241
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,540
I mean, you guys are divorced.

242
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,360
Get a grip, man.

243
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:28,940
Get a grip.

244
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,220
No messages.

245
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:30,880
Oh.

246
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,640
You haven't even cleaned up the papers on your floor.

247
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,280
There's loaves on the floor.

248
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,820
This is wasteful.

249
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,680
This is wasteful, wasteful.

250
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,320
That won't be nice.

251
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,080
I want to be wanted the way he wants that bread.

252
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,920
He is... something's going on with that bread and him.

253
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,800
I guess I can keep it as a souvenir.

254
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,000
Doesn't it say pol... police?

255
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,420
My new job as the duck detective isn't going any better, though.

256
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,360
So he quit the force to become a detective.

257
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,380
Well, if things keep going badly, I could always sell it online.

258
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,580
I don't think that's legal.

259
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,860
I don't think that's legal.

260
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,460
I have everything I need to solve this now.

261
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,360
Okay.

262
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,620
Me.

263
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,920
The duck detective spent his last money on rent for...

264
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,100
The duck detective.

265
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,570
What?

266
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,910
Oh, on bread.

267
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,130
For the duck detective.

268
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,430
Not my proudest moment.

269
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,590
Oh, my God.

270
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,110
He spent...

271
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,650
He's addicted to the bread.

272
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,570
The spongy loaf.

273
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,890
Divorce is like algebra.

274
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,830
You look at your ex and wonder why.

275
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,470
But the toast helps me to forget.

276
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:57,670
No.

277
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,490
You gotta...

278
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,670
It's not healthy for you.

279
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,420
Hanna!

280
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:05,760
Oh!

281
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,620
Moshi moshi.

282
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,860
I'm a different duck now.

283
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,280
Hanna, take him back.

284
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,700
I haven't had a slice of bread in weeks.

285
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,240
I don't believe it.

286
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,660
I don't believe that.

287
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,640
I don't believe that at all, detective.

288
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,480
You have to believe me.

289
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,200
Oh, my God.

290
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,080
He's so loud.

291
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,140
Oh.

292
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,320
He's toasted.

293
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,100
You have?

294
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,780
You're speaking to the duck detective?

295
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,700
The duck detective?

296
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,180
Why does he sometimes sound like Bojack?

297
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,200
Let's discuss this in person.

298
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,860
Now, be there in an hour.

299
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,220
His voice is out of sync and downloadable.

300
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,980
I'd make up to do it now.

301
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,820
Bearbus.

302
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,880
Oh, no.

303
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,340
Your book's gonna get soaked.

304
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,480
I spent more than half of my remaining cash on the bus fare.

305
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,400
Oh, my God.

306
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,660
And here I was.

307
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,240
In front of Bearbus' office.

308
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,040
Some sort of...

309
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,360
...run-down call center.

310
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
I don't think you have any room to talk, mister.

311
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,560
I'd better crack this case.

312
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,440
Or...

313
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,200
I won't even have enough money to make it better.

314
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,180
Let's see what else we got in here.

315
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, there's a koala.

316
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,580
I'm just knocking everything.

317
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,420
I'm a menace.

318
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,020
I'm a menace!

319
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,400
Yeah!

320
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,880
Litter!

321
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,380
Yeah!

322
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,940
Who are you?

323
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,820
I'm staying here until I get my money back!

324
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,720
Oh no!

325
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,940
So I found him with a hard loaf.

326
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,380
Bear bus?

327
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,560
More like scam bus!

328
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,100
Ooh!

329
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,540
Scam bus!

330
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,140
Ask for details.

331
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,320
You sound unhappy.

332
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,360
You bet I am!

333
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,520
Their stupid buses always arrive late!

334
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,580
The murder victim was the dodo and they have already won.

335
00:17:59,400 --> 00:17:59,960
Stop!

336
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,200
No!

337
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,820
I came back from a work trip to the west and arrived here at 3 in the morning!

338
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,920
Oh my god!

339
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,080
And they don't even want to give me a refund.

340
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,700
How much did you pay?

341
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,780
Yeah, how much?

342
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,380
Um...

343
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,500
Two schmuck.

344
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,760
Schmuck?

345
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,840
That's not the point!

346
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,120
Where did all my money go to super tech?

347
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,860
Oh, thank you!

348
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,000
Dons, thank you.

349
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,620
Rico, thank you.

350
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,720
It's about the principle.

351
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,600
So true.

352
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,220
That is true.

353
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,280
It's the principle of it all, right?

354
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:34,980
What's over here?

355
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,320
Any evidence in the leaves?

356
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,680
Nope.

357
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,720
I think we're good.

358
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,980
He was going to go to therapy, but the therapist was a quack!

359
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,260
What's over here?

360
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,840
Oh, a sign.

361
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,600
New bus route starting in August.

362
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,220
Visit the scenic mountains of Sausitia.

363
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:56,840
Sausitia?

364
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,280
I'd always tell Anna we'd go there one day.

365
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,860
No, you have to stop thinking about her!

366
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,740
You know what?

367
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,300
At least she's alive.

368
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,940
Usually in these games, they're dead, right?

369
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,620
Okay, let's go inside.

370
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,440
Sausitia.

371
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,680
Bear bus... oh wait!

372
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,720
What's in here?

373
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,200
Waiting for the bus in the rain in the rain bus?

374
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,540
Can I trade in my 500 mint coin for Schmarks?

375
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,040
No!

376
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,900
Mint coin is priceless!

377
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,080
I mean, mint coin is the highest price!

378
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,400
What are you talking about?

379
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:50,760
One mint coin is equal to probably 500 million quadrillion bajillion macho million mint trillion Schmarks.

380
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,220
No, duck, don't have depression.

381
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,020
You're too hot.

382
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,790
Ducks are excellent skateboarders.

383
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,410
Oh my gosh.

384
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:07,950
Sephia.

385
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,070
Overlord.

386
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,790
I can already tell based on her face that the receptionist was a tough one.

387
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,010
She's a tough cookie.

388
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,270
She wouldn't make life easy for me.

389
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,690
Macho million.

390
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,330
But I had to make my way into the office.

391
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,490
Weren't we called here to investigate something?

392
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,890
Shouldn't we then...

393
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,290
Oh, sorry.

394
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,870
Sorry.

395
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,050
She's not probably going to like that.

396
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,650
I like the cat little plushie right there.

397
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,450
Oh, sorry.

398
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:33,930
Sorry.

399
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,310
No, stay out!

400
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,010
It says server room.

401
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,590
It's locked.

402
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,070
It's locked.

403
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,750
It's locked.

404
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,630
Oh, so sorry.

405
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,330
I'm so sorry.

406
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,670
Okay, you know what?

407
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,470
I'm the duck detective.

408
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,590
I'm here to investigate a case.

409
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,130
I have to make everywhere look like my office apparently.

410
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:52,570
Okay.

411
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,710
Okay.

412
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,850
Do you work here?

413
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,630
I just said I'm a duck detective.

414
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,970
Okay, the music's a little loud.

415
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,750
I'm going to turn it down.

416
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,390
Down?

417
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,270
No.

418
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,730
Well, then I can't let you in.

419
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,690
The rain was reminding me of a name.

420
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,130
Sean!

421
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,770
But I've been hired by someone from Bearbus.

422
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:13,270
Yeah.

423
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,930
Who hired you?

424
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,650
Who hired you?

425
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,510
Um, I didn't catch their name.

426
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,990
That's like the most important part, detective.

427
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,110
Listen, buddy.

428
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,330
Buddy.

429
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,910
You better get out of here or I'll have to call security.

430
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,010
There's always more to people than you might think.

431
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,590
Hey, detective, where's your pipe?

432
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,230
Paige, what are you talking about?

433
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,110
I gave up on you.

434
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,410
The pipe.

435
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:40,830
Long ago.

436
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,710
The half pipe.

437
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,590
The round pipe.

438
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:45,450
What?

439
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,930
Daniel!

440
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,370
Thank you for the aqua sofa.

441
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,770
It's a very stressful couple of days of work from in-stream heels.

442
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,290
My mind has been voiced so.

443
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,330
Thank you.

444
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,950
I should take a closer look and figure out what she's about.

445
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,770
Okay, hold on.

446
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:03,530
Sorry.

447
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,130
I know I'm...

448
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,110
There we go.

449
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,350
Okay.

450
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:06,890
I think that's...

451
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,050
We'll just keep it all at the same level.

452
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,270
Okay?

453
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:09,390
Okay.

454
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:12,670
Inspection.

455
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,770
Use the magnifying glass to find clues and press E to uncover them.

456
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,710
Okay.

457
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,590
Oh, we got a name here.

458
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,850
Name tag.

459
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,150
Last name, Wynthime.

460
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:26,970
Oh, sorry.

461
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:28,930
Sideshoe.

462
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,290
Sides...

463
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:30,850
Oh, wow.

464
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,270
Suddenly they grow...

465
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,610
Ew!

466
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,530
They grew toes!

467
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,550
It's so gross.

468
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,070
Oh.

469
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,090
Cute.

470
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:42,250
Keychain, boy band, oh, k-k-k-kpop, k-k-k-kpop band.

471
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,590
Okay.

472
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,010
Oh, she grows, ew, she grows fingers.

473
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,510
Oh god.

474
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,910
Oh, she's been crying.

475
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,230
Tears, sad.

476
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,090
Oh no, her favorite boy band, her favorite, her- oh, she just announced graduation probably.

477
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,490
Nose, nostril, oh, it's so-

478
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,350
Oh, oh, oh.

479
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,510
Oh, this is so weird, I like it though.

480
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,670
Oh, wait, I pressed the wrong thing, my bad.

481
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,590
You're still here?

482
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,650
I'll leave you alone.

483
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,890
No, but we have our information, right?

484
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,210
Can I- oh, I can investigate this too.

485
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,330
Let's see.

486
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,290
Oh.

487
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,170
Smiley, happy.

488
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:31,710
Okay.

489
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,750
Oh, what am I looking at?

490
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,210
Giraffe.

491
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,730
Cute.

492
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:37,850
Okay.

493
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,910
September 7th.

494
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,730
7th, today.

495
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,810
Cute, what does the giraffe- what does the cute giraffe have to do with it?

496
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:55,990
Wow, it's so cool how, like, everything changes when you- that's so fun.

497
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,070
Tomorrow is Friday.

498
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,170
Need to remember to collect my dry cleaning.

499
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,230
This is making me remember how much I miss watching you gasp.

500
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,930
And I think you're gonna regret this now.

501
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:07,930
It's locked.

502
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,090
What are you talking about?

503
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,430
I literally just told you you need to stay out!

504
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,370
Oh, sorry.

505
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:12,870
Sorry.

506
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,430
Oh, this thing.

507
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,250
What's this?

508
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,690
I swear to God, if someone steals my mug again, I'll end them.

509
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,170
Mug stolen threats.

510
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,230
Suggestions, okay.

511
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,070
Laura from CS is way too loud.

512
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,990
I can hear her keyboard.

513
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,050
All the way to my desk.

514
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,250
First name, Laura.

515
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,890
It's Sophie's birthday.

516
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,310
Hef.

517
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,110
Hef.

518
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:54,910
Thursday.

519
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,250
Next!

520
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,190
They really should enunciate better.

521
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,050
Just saying.

522
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:12,410
Sophie.

523
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,230
First name.

524
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,150
Why'd they write it like that?

525
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,030
It looks like Hef though, right?

526
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,830
It looks like Hef.

527
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,470
I was like, what even...

528
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,330
What is a Hef Thursday?

529
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,170
Suggestions...

530
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,450
There's one more thing we're missing.

531
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,410
Oh, birthday!

532
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,010
Okay.

533
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,090
Wait, is that today?

534
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,250
It's her birthday!

535
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,810
You would want that, huh?

536
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,770
It's important to work out a suspect's name to crack the case.

537
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,470
Enter their first and last name into the slots below their portrait in the journal suspect page.

538
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,470
So...

539
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,430
What does CS stand for?

540
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,420
Handwriting be wild and...

541
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,080
Right?

542
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,740
I think this detective might be a quack.

543
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,020
Hef, Hef.

544
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,580
Oh, customer service!

545
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,780
But this is not customer service.

546
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,640
This is...

547
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,820
This is...

548
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,620
Oh my gosh.

549
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,500
Why can't I remember?

550
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,940
Crime scene?

551
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,680
Counter strike?

552
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,050
This is...

553
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,010
Yeah, receptionist.

554
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:30,640
Thank you.

555
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,140
Oh my goodness.

556
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,220
So let's go with Sophie.

557
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,840
Wind timer.

558
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,800
Okay.

559
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,200
Thanks, Sophie.

560
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,140
No one wished me a happy birthday today.

561
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,380
Not even my parents.

562
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,240
My birthday is in August.

563
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:45,800
Oh my god.

564
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,280
Jesus.

565
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,300
Shut up.

566
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,520
You made me feel bad for you.

567
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,680
I need to check my notes in the deduction section.

568
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,160
The deduction section.

569
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,380
Okay.

570
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,560
So...

571
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,840
So, deduct detective.

572
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,420
Nobody.

573
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:11,180
Sophie is feeling sad because nobody has remembered her birthday.

574
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,820
That's why she's making such a face.

575
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,120
I should try and cheer her up.

576
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,440
She's watching K-pop to make herself feel better.

577
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,540
Probably.

578
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,540
You're still here?

579
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,160
Sophie.

580
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,280
What if I just tell her your first and last name?

581
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,100
Good observation, Sophie Windtimer.

582
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,020
Get out.

583
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,580
Aren't you impressed I deduced your name?

584
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,660
Haha.

585
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,640
Deduction.

586
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,840
I'm wearing a name tag, nitwit.

587
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,260
Oh.

588
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,360
Well, it doesn't say your first name, though.

589
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:46,780
Yeah.

590
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,540
That part is creepy, but I'm choosing to ignore it.

591
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,920
It's even creepier that I know your birthday, huh?

592
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,480
You're still here?

593
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,420
Happy birthday.

594
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,120
I'm just here to wish you a happy birthday.

595
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,780
How's the audio, by the way?

596
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,540
I know I've been adjusting it, but let me know if it's too loud or too quiet.

597
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,280
I don't think it's too quiet, but...

598
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,520
How did you know?

599
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,560
Just another one of duck detectives.

600
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,580
Great deductions.

601
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,720
Huh?

602
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,880
Huh?

603
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,640
Is it a long way to your heart, Sophie?

604
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,160
No, we're not trying to risk, Sophie.

605
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,280
Anyway, that was really nice of you.

606
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,220
No one else remembered.

607
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,200
Can you believe it?

608
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,040
Remembered.

609
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,300
If you know my birthday, you must have a connection to someone here.

610
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,340
Here's the key card to the office.

611
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,280
Oh, that's it?

612
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:35,760
Wow.

613
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,120
I don't know if that's how that works.

614
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,360
There, bud.

615
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:39,560
There, bud.

616
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:39,800
Office.

617
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,260
Office.

618
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,480
Office.

619
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,500
Office.

620
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:40,860
Key card.

621
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,100
Very good.

622
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,000
Thank you.

623
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,820
It says it's locked.

624
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,260
Oh, okay.

625
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:47,880
Just kidding.

626
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,080
Here we go.

627
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,200
See you later, Sophie.

628
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,280
Any...

629
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,660
By the time I leave, there won't be a dry eye in this whole building.

630
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:02,980
But not because you're sad that nobody remembered your birthday, but because you'll miss me.

631
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,420
The stained carpets and peeling wallpaper exuded a stench of stale coffee in a

632
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,260
Happy birthday, Sophie.

633
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,660
I got you a wedding... Why are we raising Sophie?

634
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,640
This is the last straw!

635
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,260
How do they do that with their...

636
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:37,400
How do they do that with their mouth?

637
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,860
Freddersen needs to be fired!

638
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,480
I'll see what I can do.

639
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,920
Freddersen, eh?

640
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,580
Oh, hello.

641
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,660
Who are you?

642
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,620
I'm Duck Detective.

643
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,920
Do you have a problem?

644
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,320
If you have one, just call our damn hotline.

645
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm Eugene McQuacklin, the Duck Detective.

646
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,100
Eugene McQuacklin!

647
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,760
A client hired me to investigate a case.

648
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,560
Why didn't you just say so?

649
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,160
You interrogated me first!

650
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,460
It's time we put an end to the awful lunch theft.

651
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,440
Lunch theft?

652
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,560
All we need to fire him is some evidence for the upper management.

653
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,260
Okay.

654
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,600
I'll be in my office.

655
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,820
Eugene McQuacklin.

656
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,500
First, I had to find out who works here and what their jobs are.

657
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,160
I needed to find my client as well.

658
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,740
Yeah, who the hell hired us?

659
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,800
Thankfully, I remembered the piece of paper I had in my jacket.

660
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,320
From taking notes...

661
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,700
Okay.

662
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,920
Client note.

663
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,540
Alright, let's check it out.

664
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,460
Where's the notes?

665
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,120
So we have Sophie, mystery man...

666
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,700
Here.

667
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,760
I hastily wrote this before heading to the client's address.

668
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,840
Okay, so I guess it has some stuff that is important.

669
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,140
Tricky deductions might require new perspectives.

670
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,600
Press H to get additional guidance at any time.

671
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,400
Alright.

672
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh, sorry.

673
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,380
The two desks on this side look unused.

674
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,540
Let's look around real quick.

675
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,200
Oh, sorry.

676
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:21,800
I'm sorry.

677
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,440
I'm sorry.

678
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,100
Who's this guy?

679
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,560
He looks really... I think he doesn't need any more cups of coffee.

680
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,580
It's a list of all the bus drivers.

681
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,140
Ooh.

682
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,960
The most busy driver out of all four seems to be Petrovich.

683
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,780
Petrovich.

684
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,840
Petrovich.

685
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,540
Interesting.

686
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,280
Cute.

687
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,500
Oh, let's see what we got.

688
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:42,940
Bear bus.

689
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,100
Brezel.

690
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,100
Station bre...

691
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,400
Oh, I thought that was somebody's name.

692
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,160
The pretzel.

693
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,700
Oh, salad...

694
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,800
Salad...

695
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,780
Salad chica.

696
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,360
Escargot.

697
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,220
Okay.

698
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,060
Haul...

699
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,700
Haul...

700
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,660
Haul in these.

701
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,760
Nice.

702
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,140
Okay.

703
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,220
Their buses don't go very far.

704
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,020
Hmm.

705
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,480
They're cheap.

706
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,420
Whose office is it?

707
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,820
I shouldn't go outside yet.

708
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,680
Oh, outside.

709
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,600
I need to find out who the people in this office are first.

710
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,220
Did I remember to write down their professions in my deductions?

711
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,140
Oh.

712
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,040
I don't think... Not yet.

713
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,600
Oh, sorry.

714
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,000
My bad.

715
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,680
Um...

716
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,380
This guy looks...

717
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:34,780
Um...

718
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,600
Are you okay?

719
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,200
Let's...

720
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,440
Let's observe you first.

721
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,100
Oh, God.

722
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,140
Oh, my God.

723
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,320
Strained eyes.

724
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,580
Insomniac.

725
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,620
Different brand.

726
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,340
Own headset.

727
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,220
Dedicated.

728
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,340
Dedicated to the job.

729
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,520
Oh, my God.

730
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:51,960
Are you okay?

731
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,980
Are you okay?

732
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,280
Their claws are out.

733
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,420
Oh, energy drink.

734
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,480
Bad habits.

735
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,140
Oh, my God.

736
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,220
Oh, my God.

737
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,340
Interesting.

738
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,140
Okay.

739
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,220
What else we got in here?

740
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,000
Someone...

741
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,200
Whitlock.

742
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,600
Last name Whitlock.

743
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,220
Just like me for real, for real.

744
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,880
Hottie.

745
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:17,900
Posing.

746
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,280
Me in...

747
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,040
Wait.

748
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,120
Password hint.

749
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,440
Me in sexy aliens.

750
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,440
What is...

751
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,000
What is...

752
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,020
What is...

753
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,200
What is...

754
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:30,900
What does that mean?

755
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,400
What does that mean?

756
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,180
I don't know what I'm looking...

757
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:39,620
Oh, password.

758
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,520
Accessible.

759
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,420
Is it?

760
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,560
Me in...

761
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,800
I wonder if there are clues to her password.

762
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,160
I don't think I have enough information to crack it yet.

763
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,960
I don't think I want the information.

764
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:52,980
Sorry.

765
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,780
What's this?

766
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,240
I'm gathering everything before we talk to people.

767
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,620
Employee of the month.

768
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,880
Yippee.

769
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,600
Insert photo here.

770
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,060
Oh.

771
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Come on.

772
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,200
Layout.

773
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:06,780
Lazy.

774
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,120
Who is making that noise?

775
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,820
Freddie sucks.

776
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,580
First name.

777
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,420
Freddie.

778
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,320
Fixed.

779
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,220
Rufus Sedaris.

780
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,160
Last name.

781
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,520
No, no, no.

782
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,320
Let's get the first name.

783
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,840
Rufus.

784
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,470
Stop with the post-its.

785
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,110
I'm sorry.

786
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:32,610
I'm sorry.

787
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,110
I'm not sure I'd feel particularly appreciated.

788
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,850
I got an achievement.

789
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,570
Complete five inspections.

790
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,170
The kitchen.

791
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,350
In here must be the crime scene.

792
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,710
First, I want to find out who the people in the office are.

793
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,150
It will make things easier in the long run.

794
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:52,910
Freddie Fazbear.

795
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,530
I'll need to remember to write everything down in my deductions.

796
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,170
No, this is Freddie after he got the divorce.

797
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,550
He didn't get to keep the last name.

798
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,090
You know?

799
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,050
All right.

800
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:02,530
So, we got...

801
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:02,610
We got...

802
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:02,630
All right.

803
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,430
This in here.

804
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,250
It says come in.

805
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,110
Oh.

806
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:08,770
Hello.

807
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:11,610
Oh.

808
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,550
Harnessed.

809
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,010
The dimly lit room seemed to promise well-kept secrets and rumors.

810
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,990
And rumors.

811
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,670
What we got here?

812
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:29,510
It's a letter for an application for a promotion to senior customer service agent.

813
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:29,890
Ooh.

814
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,050
Signed by L.Engst.

815
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,550
L.Engst.

816
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:34,630
L.Engst.

817
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,530
We died.

818
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,890
Thanks for the vibe, Gupton.

819
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,710
He's got kids.

820
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:42,690
Oh my god.

821
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,750
Look at this loving family.

822
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:45,730
Baby one.

823
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,050
Kids.

824
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,210
Identical age.

825
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,950
Twins.

826
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,690
Baby two.

827
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,210
How do you tell the difference?

828
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:56,930
Hair.

829
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,390
What else can we notice here?

830
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,670
What else do we notice here?

831
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,730
Just the twins?

832
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:04,610
What else?

833
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,390
Oh, a secret.

834
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,070
Hinge.

835
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,010
The safe is behind there.

836
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,170
Framed.

837
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,030
High quality.

838
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,270
I think so.

839
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,840
Secret, secrets.

840
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,040
We have secrets in here.

841
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,860
Number one dad.

842
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,720
We'll talk to him in a second.

843
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,080
Oh, what's the R?

844
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,680
This guy is...

845
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,820
Oh, Ernst.

846
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:47,780
Ernst.

847
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,840
So we gotta...

848
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,920
I gotta remember to start writing people's names down in here, right?

849
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,900
Oh, we don't know his first name yet.

850
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,620
Might be Freddy, cause he is a bear.

851
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,300
No, Freddy's last name was different.

852
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,740
Ernst.

853
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,340
Let's observe you.

854
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,100
Oh.

855
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,040
Angry brow.

856
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,540
Stir.

857
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,820
Okay, your ears are clean.

858
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,980
Oh my goodness.

859
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,140
He's buff.

860
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,520
Tie.

861
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,540
Expensive.

862
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,680
Branch manager.

863
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,700
Ernst.

864
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,480
Oh my god.

865
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,400
Look at these arms, beef.

866
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,160
Ew!

867
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,780
Stain.

868
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,800
Baby food.

869
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,880
Family man.

870
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,120
Nothing in your pants?

871
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,600
Your fancy little shoes?

872
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,400
Okay.

873
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,000
Alright, I guess we'll start talking with him.

874
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,420
How are the detective things?

875
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,000
The unknown things are the five gifted things.

876
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,240
Thank you.

877
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,420
It's Mr. McQuacklin.

878
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,960
Mr. McQuacklin, please, sir.

879
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:47,740
Right.

880
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:48,960
Apologies.

881
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,440
Right.

882
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,320
Added to clues.

883
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:52,700
Why?

884
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,720
Are you planning on staying in my office much longer?

885
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,140
Why are you doing secret things in here?

886
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,520
I'll have to inspect the entire premise to do my job correctly.

887
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,900
Well, hurry up.

888
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,780
Mm-hmm.

889
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,480
What is I?

890
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,420
Oh.

891
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,640
Question.

892
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,540
Was it you who called me?

893
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,500
No.

894
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,520
I never heard of you before.

895
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,000
That's unusual.

896
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,380
It's good you're here.

897
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,500
Since there has been some...

898
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:20,960
unrest.

899
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,140
Unrest, you say?

900
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,640
Interesting, interesting.

901
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,420
Well, I'll see myself out, Mr. Ernst.

902
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:30,940
Ernst.

903
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,000
Hmm.

904
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,120
Suspicious.

905
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:35,640
Yeah.

906
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,300
Why is...

907
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,480
Also, what is this stain here on the ground?

908
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,560
I'm hearing ghost typing and it's making me nervous.

909
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,700
Let's talk to this stressed little fellow.

910
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,180
Oh.

911
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:45,720
Just kidding.

912
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,840
She answers a call.

913
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,740
This is Fairbus.

914
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,800
How can I help you?

915
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,800
This is the third time you're calling.

916
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,680
I'm telling you, your ex-wife did not cancel your booking.

917
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,980
She looks busy.

918
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,820
I'll come back.

919
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,680
Oh.

920
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,160
Oh.

921
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,120
Just kidding.

922
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,380
I didn't mean to press it again.

923
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,360
I meant to press R.

924
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:06,900
Question?

925
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,980
What is your relationship with Sophie Windheimer?

926
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,320
Excuse me for a second.

927
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,420
Oh, man.

928
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,060
I don't know how I'd survive the office without her.

929
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,020
Sucks that she's at the reception.

930
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:18,740
Aww.

931
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,280
I would have loved to have her in the office.

932
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,320
Interesting.

933
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:22,820
I'm back.

934
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,540
Yes.

935
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,980
Please collect your toddler from the bus station.

936
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,560
Toddler.

937
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,840
I like the way she enunciated that.

938
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,280
Toddler.

939
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,620
So much divorce in this game.

940
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:32,940
I know.

941
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,180
Right?

942
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,620
Are the devs okay?

943
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,380
No.

944
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,100
I'm sorry.

945
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,800
You can't take your 12 trombones on the bus.

946
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,060
What?

947
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,260
Can't you see I'm talking to a customer?

948
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:43,820
Oh.

949
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,340
It's company policy.

950
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,560
Nothing I can do.

951
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,720
She's very busy.

952
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,620
She's very busy.

953
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,900
Do you know anything about who called me here?

954
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,340
Yeah.

955
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,640
There's a...

956
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,780
What are you talking about?

957
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,580
Listen.

958
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,980
I have a million more emails to answer.

959
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,220
And there are 50 people in the phone queue.

960
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,020
Where's the rest of the people?

961
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,740
I have worked ten days in a row including three night shifts.

962
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,860
And Manfred still doesn't want to give me a raise.

963
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,580
Manfred.

964
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,060
Huh?

965
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,120
Just leave me at peace.

966
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,160
So...

967
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,260
You have no clues for me?

968
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:16,800
Damn.

969
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,580
Mr. McQuacklin.

970
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,380
How does she do that?

971
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,380
Okay.

972
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,620
Let's go talk to our little gator friend over here.

973
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,400
Oh.

974
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,240
First of all...

975
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,660
What's this?

976
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:38,880
Receipt.

977
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,740
Expensive.

978
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,100
West currency.

979
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,560
What else we got here?

980
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,460
Salami?

981
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,840
High quality.

982
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,840
Salami, eh?

983
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,440
Spotless.

984
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,220
Good condition.

985
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,100
Takes good care of his salami.

986
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,840
That's a lot of salami.

987
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,820
Let a man have his own amount of salami.

988
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,960
Who's to you to say how much is a lot of salami?

989
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,000
Right?

990
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,620
Okay.

991
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,020
Look at all those teeth!

992
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:12,720
Laura!

993
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,980
Custom mug.

994
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:18,980
Wait.

995
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,640
Are those glasses?

996
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,900
Thick glasses.

997
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,180
Strong prescription.

998
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,040
Bad eyesight.

999
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,960
Oh my gosh.

1000
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,860
The way the nose just like...

1001
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,720
Claws.

1002
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,300
Anything in your pants?

1003
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,380
Velcro shoes.

1004
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,560
Lame!

1005
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,740
You guys, recently most of my shoes have become like slip-on.

1006
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,540
Is that the same as like... It's not the same as velcro, right?

1007
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:58,150
Like they have shoelaces on them but I don't need to tie them.

1008
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,070
I can just slip them on.

1009
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,590
Slip-on life.

1010
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,130
Yeah.

1011
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,050
It's so much easier when...

1012
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:10,910
When you like get home and you have to take off your shoes and...

1013
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,170
Or if you're leaving you have to just slip them on, you know?

1014
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:13,790
It's so nice.

1015
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:17,950
Slip-on is classy.

1016
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:18,390
Okay.

1017
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,770
We're the slip-on life, everybody.

1018
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,810
Alright, let's talk to our little gator friend.

1019
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,670
I'm the only one here in the operating office.

1020
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:25,670
Can you imagine?

1021
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,890
Can you imagine?

1022
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,410
I plan all the bus routes and make sure the buses are on time.

1023
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,810
I want a voice in Duck Detective next game.

1024
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,870
Isn't that so cool?

1025
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,830
Isn't that so cool?

1026
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:42,130
Don't you have an angry customer shouting outside about the buses being late?

1027
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,470
I...

1028
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:44,630
Really?

1029
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:45,870
Really?

1030
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,690
Yes, really?

1031
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,010
Do you have any idea who picked me to investigate?

1032
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:55,650
Yeah.

1033
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:01,250
No idea but I'm so happy you're here.

1034
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,830
I don't think... I don't believe that.

1035
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,350
I think... I sense a little tension.

1036
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,110
I have a copy of your book.

1037
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,410
The early bird catches the criminal.

1038
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,350
Oh, he's a fan.

1039
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,330
I'm not signing anything though.

1040
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,430
Can you sign it?

1041
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,790
No.

1042
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:17,810
Maybe... later.

1043
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,550
The fact it was a prompt.

1044
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:23,990
Oh, okay.

1045
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:27,270
I'll just keep the copy right here.

1046
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,250
I'll just keep the copy right here.

1047
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,770
So you could sign it.

1048
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:31,570
Later.

1049
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:32,230
Later.

1050
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,690
Yeah, later.

1051
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,010
See you later.

1052
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:35,490
See you later.

1053
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:35,590
See you later.

1054
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,370
See you later.

1055
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:37,930
So...

1056
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,370
I guess now we head to the kitchen.

1057
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,590
But he has a cup name that's written Laura.

1058
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,170
Is that your cup?

1059
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,670
In here must be the crime scene.

1060
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,970
First, I want to find out who the people in the office are.

1061
00:43:54,430 --> 00:44:00,490
When you said your shoes became slip-ons, I was thinking they were regular shoes but slowly became slip-ons because your feet were shrinking.

1062
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,070
It will make things easier.

1063
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:04,630
Oh, okay.

1064
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:05,850
Let's write everything down.

1065
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:06,370
Okay.

1066
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,690
First, what's... not Freddy.

1067
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:11,810
What was it?

1068
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,270
Hold on.

1069
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,400
Rufus.

1070
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,500
Rufus.

1071
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,000
And then, Freddy sucks.

1072
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,640
I'm so bad with names.

1073
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,180
Oh my goodness.

1074
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:31,820
Okay.

1075
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,000
Gator is forever rejected.

1076
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:37,920
Um...

1077
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,740
Oh yes, it was Manfred, right?

1078
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,400
Probably.

1079
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,060
You...

1080
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,720
Are you Laura?

1081
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,840
And you're Rufus.

1082
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,080
Nope.

1083
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:52,540
Wrong.

1084
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,160
Wrong.

1085
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,160
Oh, just kidding.

1086
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,380
Oh wait, it was Freddy, wasn't it?

1087
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,460
Oh, no it's not.

1088
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:58,980
Okay.

1089
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,500
Just kidding.

1090
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,180
Oh.

1091
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:01,640
No.

1092
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,260
Let me stop.

1093
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,420
I don't want to take it out.

1094
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,240
The bear is man...

1095
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,200
Oh!

1096
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,560
Oh, Freddy's a nickname!

1097
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,600
Wait, how did he get...

1098
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,940
Employee of the Month, then?

1099
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,100
That's kind of icky.

1100
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,840
He's the branch manager.

1101
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,800
This doesn't make much sense.

1102
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,780
So, Rufus... What was the last name, though?

1103
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,080
Was it Pe...

1104
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:35,900
No.

1105
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:36,840
Oh gosh.

1106
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,540
Whitlock was the girl... was that...

1107
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,020
The sexy lamb.

1108
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,260
Who's Angst?

1109
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,580
Hold on.

1110
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,640
I gotta go back and look.

1111
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,380
Check stuff out.

1112
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,480
This is...

1113
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,320
Yeah, Whitlock is this lady.

1114
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,520
I can't tell if this is Laura or not.

1115
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,700
What if this is Laura?

1116
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,320
Where are you anyway?

1117
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:02,640
Hmm...

1118
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,200
I shouldn't go outside.

1119
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,180
I need to find out.

1120
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:05,600
Okay.

1121
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,240
Rufus?

1122
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:12,540
Citrus?

1123
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,680
I thought it was Freddy Citrus.

1124
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,040
You guys are really bad with names.

1125
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,540
Please forgive me.

1126
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,440
Oh, it is Rufus!

1127
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:21,960
You're so right.

1128
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:22,580
Okay.

1129
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,140
But didn't we try that?

1130
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,140
Yeah, it wasn't him.

1131
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,380
Are you Laura?

1132
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,620
But we don't know Laura's last name, do we?

1133
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,900
What other things do we have?

1134
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,660
Laura from customer service is way too loud.

1135
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,900
We got Sophie.

1136
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,960
Bag of salami.

1137
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,300
Oh, I can just go here.

1138
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,560
It says there's a photo here.

1139
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,860
And this kind of looks like a duck.

1140
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:08,240
By my very astute deductions.

1141
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,360
Imagine the aroma of Mint's gaming chair.

1142
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,840
Bob, you didn't need to type that.

1143
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,500
You didn't need to...

1144
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,800
You didn't need to send that.

1145
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,860
Oh, no.

1146
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,240
Are you okay?

1147
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,040
What was this button?

1148
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,840
Oh, the bus drivers.

1149
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,340
Busy driver out of all four seems to be Petrovich.

1150
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,220
Petrovich is the driver.

1151
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:43,900
Okay.

1152
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:47,960
Let's see.

1153
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,220
I don't think Laura has a last name though, right?

1154
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,180
What was the angst?

1155
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,660
Oh!

1156
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,560
Just kidding.

1157
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,300
When did we learn her last name?

1158
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,520
Am I...

1159
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,580
I don't want to just like...

1160
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,680
Just guess around everything.

1161
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,100
It fits her.

1162
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,960
I don't want to guess around everything.

1163
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,600
Intuition.

1164
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,880
Those are the bus stops.

1165
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,800
The promotion note.

1166
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,860
Oh, yes, you're right.

1167
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,240
And then she said that he refuses to give her a promotion.

1168
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,370
Maybe if we sign his book, we'll learn his...

1169
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:50,070
Oh, true.

1170
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,610
There we go.

1171
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:56,570
El angst.

1172
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:58,970
Okay.

1173
00:48:59,130 --> 00:48:59,810
Oh, you're right.

1174
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,510
We probably do have to sign his book so that we can learn his name.

1175
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:03,730
Who do we make it out to?

1176
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,730
All right.

1177
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,590
Let's go talk to him.

1178
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:08,610
Okay.

1179
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:10,370
Oh, hello.

1180
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:11,210
Hi.

1181
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,490
How are you, Mr. Duck Detective?

1182
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,450
I'm good.

1183
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,130
Oh.

1184
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,950
What do you know about Manfred Ernst?

1185
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:20,690
Ernst.

1186
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,430
I think he likes me.

1187
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,770
He's the only one who doesn't shout at me.

1188
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:26,230
Oh.

1189
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:28,170
Okay.

1190
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,030
I'm the only one here in the operating office.

1191
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:32,950
Can you imagine?

1192
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:33,890
Oh, God.

1193
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,610
No wonder things don't get done.

1194
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,930
I plan all the bus routes and make sure the buses are on time.

1195
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,570
Isn't that so?

1196
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,930
Don't you have an angst?

1197
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:42,850
Really?

1198
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:43,910
Okay.

1199
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:45,970
It was this one, though, that we...

1200
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:47,290
So, you...

1201
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:47,650
Nope.

1202
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:48,170
But I...

1203
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:49,270
Oh, no.

1204
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,330
Maybe we can't ask about the book.

1205
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:51,950
Oh, no.

1206
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:52,190
Wait.

1207
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:53,790
Oh, that's a salami.

1208
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,990
Maybe we can't ask about the book anymore.

1209
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:57,390
Hmm.

1210
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,600
What do you think about Manfred Ernst?

1211
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,820
Manfred Ernst.

1212
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:04,920
Oh, he's a great guy.

1213
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,140
I just wish I'd finally get a raise.

1214
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,040
Oh, Laura.

1215
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:08,560
Yes.

1216
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:08,880
Sorry.

1217
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:09,780
This is Bear Bus.

1218
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,640
Your bus will be three hours late.

1219
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,980
It's on the desk?

1220
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,260
Behind him?

1221
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,960
No, I think what I'm seeing is the little bubble above him.

1222
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,780
I'm pretty sure it's his personal bubble.

1223
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:25,860
You know?

1224
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,280
Three hours late, baby.

1225
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,660
Let's go.

1226
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:33,980
How do I...

1227
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,440
How do I autograph your thing?

1228
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,540
Also, why are you using Laura's mug?

1229
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,760
Your name is not Laura.

1230
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,020
Oh, hello.

1231
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,160
How are you?

1232
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,480
Hmm.

1233
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,580
How am I supposed to get this?

1234
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,340
Maybe I should have...

1235
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,920
Maybe they didn't expect me to be an asshole.

1236
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,320
The book behind him.

1237
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,160
Why are you yelling at me?

1238
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,680
This book right here?

1239
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,400
This?

1240
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:13,530
Do you...

1241
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,530
Don't you realize you're stupid now?

1242
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,430
You yelled at me so much.

1243
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:19,790
The book is behind him.

1244
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,210
I'm sorry.

1245
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,210
Do you feel dumb now?

1246
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,010
There's no bubble above it.

1247
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,680
Don't yell at me.

1248
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,500
When you...

1249
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,880
Maybe if you click on it some more.

1250
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,010
But have you tried the...

1251
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,630
Oh, it's clearly in the plant.

1252
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:48,150
Yeah, it's on the other side of the table in the plant.

1253
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:49,350
Obviously.

1254
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:55,550
Hmm.

1255
00:51:59,050 --> 00:51:59,710
Well, all we have to do is wait.

1256
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:00,950
All we have is Rufus or Freddy.

1257
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:04,970
Freddersen.

1258
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,170
Where did we learn that last name from?

1259
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:08,810
Hmm.

1260
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,120
Freddersen.

1261
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:17,780
Freddersen.

1262
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,040
There's still some...

1263
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,800
Oh, maybe we can go talk to the reception again.

1264
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,160
Freddy Freddersen?

1265
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:32,040
Let's ask her opinion on some of these people.

1266
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,440
What can you tell me about Laura and...

1267
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,780
Laura needs to chill out.

1268
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:37,160
Dang.

1269
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,800
I do love her.

1270
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:45,120
But if she keeps living like this, she'll have a heart attack by 23.

1271
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,800
She's not even 22.

1272
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,120
Oh, boy.

1273
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,800
So, do you have an idea who would have hired me?

1274
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,960
It's about the incident, isn't it?

1275
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,060
The incident.

1276
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,900
I'm sorry.

1277
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,460
Thank you for the raid.

1278
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,200
Wait, hold on.

1279
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:02,780
Leah!

1280
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,740
Oh, my God.

1281
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,440
Oh, my God.

1282
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,560
Hi, Leah!

1283
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,720
Thanks for the raid!

1284
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,800
Oh, my gosh.

1285
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:10,780
Hello.

1286
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,580
Thanks for the raid, girl.

1287
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,320
Mervy, thanks for the ten gifted.

1288
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,720
Welcome, welcome.

1289
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,320
We just kind of started this case.

1290
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,040
It says it's locked.

1291
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:33,440
Dang.

1292
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,360
We still can't get in there.

1293
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,980
Basically, I don't even know why I'm here.

1294
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,860
I was gonna say I was gonna give you what has happened so far, but...

1295
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,900
I don't even know.

1296
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,100
I don't even know.

1297
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,380
Ducky, thanks for the gift.

1298
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:49,800
Raymak, thanks for the five.

1299
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,800
Thanks for the ten, Gifton.

1300
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:54,400
Oh my gosh.

1301
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,800
Implode, thanks for the five, Gifton.

1302
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,180
Thank you for the five, Gifton.

1303
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,000
Brandon, welcome back.

1304
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,820
Thanks for the five, Gifton.

1305
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,320
Rico, thanks for the five, Gifton.

1306
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,900
Thank you guys, thank you, thank you.

1307
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,060
Oh my goodness.

1308
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,680
Thank you guys, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1309
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,900
We're trying to figure out this dang crocodile's name.

1310
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,280
But I think I missed a prompt because the game didn't expect me to be a jerk.

1311
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,020
I'm sorry I was a jerk to you.

1312
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:19,840
Please.

1313
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:30,300
No, let me sign your book.

1314
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,160
Mini Scooter.

1315
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,720
Thank you for the fifty...

1316
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,730
It's gone.

1317
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:41,490
Cooper, thanks for the ten, Gifton.

1318
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:43,930
Thank you so much.

1319
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,510
Oh my god, is that another raid?

1320
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:47,090
What is happening?

1321
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,250
Alien Mixture, thanks for the raid.

1322
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:53,770
Thank you.

1323
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:54,830
What is going on?

1324
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:58,890
Oh my god, our little duck detective, he's humming to himself.

1325
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:01,350
Look, he even has an AFK pose.

1326
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:01,930
That's so cute.

1327
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,450
I'm the only one here in the operating office.

1328
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:04,930
I play...

1329
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:06,170
Don't you...

1330
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:06,790
I...

1331
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:07,310
Really?

1332
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:14,550
Okay, also let's go ask... I guess we can go ask...

1333
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,170
the boss man.

1334
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,750
I guess you have to take to the bar, Gifton.

1335
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,710
Thank you, thank you guys.

1336
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:26,010
Thank you for the raids installed.

1337
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:28,850
You.

1338
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,910
What do you know about Laura Angst?

1339
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,090
Oh, she's a fantastic employee.

1340
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:34,890
Yeah, you gonna give her a raise?

1341
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,970
She basically does the work of five people.

1342
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:39,030
And she deserves the pay of five people.

1343
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,090
That's it?

1344
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,360
Is that why all the desks are empty?

1345
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,000
Because...

1346
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,680
Because there's no one else?

1347
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,220
You guys, I'm not quite sure what to do here.

1348
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,520
You know what...

1349
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,080
Detective work isn't easy.

1350
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,440
Ponder details.

1351
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,980
The thing that bothered me in particular was...

1352
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:05,980
Suspects?

1353
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,800
I couldn't wrap my head around the suspects.

1354
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,140
Could you hit Q for me?

1355
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,720
Especially their...

1356
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,280
Names.

1357
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,500
Once I knew someone's name, I had to write it down on the suspect's page.

1358
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:23,080
Only then could I interrogate suspects about their opinion of other people.

1359
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,960
Finding out people's names was a whole other task, though.

1360
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,560
Yeah, how am I supposed to get the gator's name?

1361
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,280
Often, there are clues in the environment that they work in.

1362
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:32,820
Okay.

1363
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:39,720
Be that documents, digital or analog, or remarks of their co-workers.

1364
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,840
It won't let me go into this room yet.

1365
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,040
In here, must first...

1366
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,140
It will make things...

1367
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:46,980
I'll need to remember...

1368
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,500
It won't let me go in here, and it won't let me go in here.

1369
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,640
I shouldn't...

1370
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,260
I need to...

1371
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,260
Did I remember to...

1372
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,920
Is there anything written here that I missed?

1373
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,640
Bear bus...

1374
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,920
No, not his name.

1375
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,080
Oh, someone said...

1376
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:02,700
What's Q?

1377
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,380
I'm scared.

1378
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,200
What does Q do?

1379
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:19,210
My bad.

1380
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,150
She answers the call.

1381
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:23,630
This is Bear Bus.

1382
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:24,670
How can I help you?

1383
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:27,530
This is the third time you're calling.

1384
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:30,230
I'm telling you, your ex-wife did...

1385
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:31,830
She looks busy.

1386
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,990
We did this one.

1387
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:39,710
I don't know.

1388
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:42,990
This is the bus drivers.

1389
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:46,190
Is there anything in here on the cash payment?

1390
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:46,670
Wait.

1391
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:51,830
To Mr. Brandenburg.

1392
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,510
That must be him, right?

1393
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,530
But it wouldn't let me give it as an option.

1394
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:59,630
Have I soft locked my game for real?

1395
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:05,750
It's not an option.

1396
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:08,170
See here.

1397
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:08,950
Oh.

1398
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:23,930
Oh, it's a...

1399
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,290
Oh, it's a part of Germany.

1400
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,090
Oh, just kidding.

1401
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,950
Suggestion box.

1402
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:34,370
If someone steals my mug again, I'll end them.

1403
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:35,550
We have Laura.

1404
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,530
I'm pretty sure Laura is...

1405
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:39,490
Laura...

1406
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:39,810
Oh, wait.

1407
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:40,690
This is Laura.

1408
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:41,550
Just kidding.

1409
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:42,970
Um...

1410
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:47,330
Mug on the desk.

1411
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,430
No, there's nothing else.

1412
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:48,770
This?

1413
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:49,650
What you're seeing?

1414
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,790
See, when I get close to him, it expands.

1415
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:53,090
That's...

1416
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:53,430
That's the bubble.

1417
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,810
The bubble is to talk to him.

1418
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:56,990
So, I'm totally lost.

1419
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:57,990
What the...

1420
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,490
You have the info you need?

1421
00:58:59,630 --> 00:58:59,950
I do?

1422
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:00,870
You know what?

1423
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:01,450
We're just gonna...

1424
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:04,150
Freddy...

1425
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:34,870
Anyway.

1426
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:36,210
Um...

1427
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:39,470
Let's ask what she thinks about Freddy.

1428
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:43,590
Can you tell me more about Freddy Freddersen?

1429
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:45,050
Freddy Freddersen.

1430
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,770
Let me put you on hold while I find the route for you.

1431
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:49,170
Freddy?

1432
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:50,190
Freddy?

1433
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,390
Did she just hiss at Freddy?

1434
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:55,670
This is...

1435
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:57,430
This is Leah every time she sees...

1436
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,390
That's Leah's reaction to Freddy Fazbear.

1437
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:00,150
Freddy?

1438
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:02,650
Can

1439
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,360
you imagine that?

1440
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,220
What an incompetent waste of office space.

1441
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,400
Hello, this is Laura again.

1442
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,600
I checked the bus routes and found that...

1443
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,460
Okay.

1444
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,880
She hates Freddy.

1445
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,120
Freddy?

1446
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,080
No.

1447
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,480
Okay.

1448
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,270
What about you?

1449
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:28,090
What do you think of Freddy?

1450
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:29,190
Oh, never mind.

1451
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,910
You have no opinion.

1452
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,610
You don't care about him at all.

1453
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,770
The voice acting in this game is so fun.

1454
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:46,190
Oh god.

1455
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,710
What?

1456
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:48,330
Why don't...

1457
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:50,290
Why don't you also have an opinion on Freddy?

1458
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:52,690
Weird.

1459
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,830
Okay.

1460
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:55,250
Okay.

1461
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:55,710
Okay.

1462
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,170
Onwards to the kitchen.

1463
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:57,470
Fine.

1464
01:00:58,450 --> 01:00:59,070
Please.

1465
01:00:59,630 --> 01:00:59,940
What?

1466
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:02,390
Wait.

1467
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:04,690
What am I missing?

1468
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:05,470
Oh.

1469
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,010
Something in here?

1470
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:07,090
Oh.

1471
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:07,610
Okay.

1472
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:07,890
Okay.

1473
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:08,030
Okay.

1474
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:09,030
Um.

1475
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:13,330
Sophie, the giraffe, works as a receptionist.

1476
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:18,270
The bear is Manfred as the branch manager.

1477
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,850
Laura, the cat, works in customer service.

1478
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:25,550
The crocodile called Freddy works in...

1479
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:25,710
Okay.

1480
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:25,990
Uh.

1481
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:27,330
Operating office.

1482
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,150
Duck approved, baby.

1483
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:35,030
Now that I had worked out these names, I was ready to check out the crime scene.

1484
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,050
The crime scene.

1485
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:38,430
Let's see where that lunch got stolen from.

1486
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:41,850
Then, I could finally talk to my client.

1487
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:42,970
Okay.

1488
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:45,330
That's a nice way to like be able to keep track of everyone.

1489
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:46,830
What they do and everything.

1490
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,130
Average of five duck per square meter?

1491
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:55,610
As soon as I enter the kitchen, the comforting waft of cheap white toast entered my nostrils.

1492
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,030
Oh, no.

1493
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:56,490
No, no.

1494
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:57,810
You can't relapse, detective.

1495
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:04,230
I knew I had to stay strong.

1496
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,690
Our detective is addicted to the white.

1497
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:08,150
To the white bread.

1498
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:08,670
The...

1499
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:09,550
Not the wheat.

1500
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:11,110
Not the whole grain.

1501
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,610
The cheap white bread.

1502
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:16,330
This wasn't what I was here for.

1503
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:17,090
The milk toast.

1504
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:19,030
Just one crumb.

1505
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:19,530
No, no.

1506
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:20,570
Stop eating the icing.

1507
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:21,610
Ooh.

1508
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,390
Can't you wait a couple hours?

1509
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:24,790
Margaret.

1510
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:25,230
It's...

1511
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:31,550
If it wasn't for these pants almost bursting, I'd have this for breakfast every day.

1512
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:33,130
Margaret.

1513
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,270
Yes, yes.

1514
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:38,110
And you can have it and so much more later when we're done preparing.

1515
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:39,570
Why is this place a mess?

1516
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:40,810
Aren't you at work?

1517
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:41,610
What are you doing?

1518
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:42,270
Why are you cooking?

1519
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,990
So we have Margaret here.

1520
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:46,690
Oh, just kidding.

1521
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:47,170
Not yet.

1522
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,090
Let's observe her maybe.

1523
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:51,090
Oh.

1524
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,370
Oh, God.

1525
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:53,350
She's...

1526
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,270
She's catfishing the whole office.

1527
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,730
As soon as you...

1528
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:04,370
As soon as you hold a magnifying glass up to her, the truth is revealed.

1529
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:08,890
Impeccable hair, well groomed.

1530
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:12,370
Whisk, baker.

1531
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:13,810
Motherly.

1532
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:14,530
Aw.

1533
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:21,870
Why is everybody divorced in this game?

1534
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:25,210
Why is literally everyone divorced?

1535
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:28,010
Oops.

1536
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:29,950
My bad.

1537
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:31,090
Oh.

1538
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:32,530
Halloween party.

1539
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:34,010
Cute.

1540
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:34,770
Cancel.

1541
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:35,230
Oh, no.

1542
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:37,690
Budget cuts.

1543
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:39,650
So she's single.

1544
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:43,470
Party.

1545
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:44,630
Hungry?

1546
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:45,790
Get your own lunch.

1547
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,250
Where did that...

1548
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:48,790
There we go.

1549
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:50,650
Angry note.

1550
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:52,030
Hungry.

1551
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:53,730
Looking for editor.

1552
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:54,350
Unpaid.

1553
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:55,230
And that's it.

1554
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:55,810
And some...

1555
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:56,990
Some...

1556
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:57,950
I think that's Laura.

1557
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:58,690
And...

1558
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:00,070
Sophie?

1559
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:02,530
Office parties are a bad idea anyway.

1560
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:05,830
They stopped doing them at the precinct after the...

1561
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:07,090
Jam.

1562
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:08,110
Incident.

1563
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:11,410
Do tell.

1564
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:12,810
Spill the tea.

1565
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,610
Spill the tea.

1566
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:18,950
Gross.

1567
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:19,410
Gross.

1568
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:23,330
I doubt they washed their hands after leaving that greasy handprint.

1569
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:27,210
What have we got in here?

1570
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:28,930
Whatever this is.

1571
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,590
Thanks for the food.

1572
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,570
Salami bandit.

1573
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:35,070
Hamprint.

1574
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:35,630
Greasy.

1575
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:36,510
Sharp claws.

1576
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:38,730
R.S.

1577
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:41,110
Margaret.

1578
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:42,930
First name Margaret.

1579
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,150
Salami bandit?

1580
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:47,710
There's a real salami bandit.

1581
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:50,550
A sandwich.

1582
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:52,830
What else we got around here?

1583
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:53,310
I don't know.

1584
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:54,490
Um...

1585
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:55,730
What am I missing?

1586
01:04:59,190 --> 01:04:59,810
Uh...

1587
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,180
Did I...

1588
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:03,700
This?

1589
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:05,160
Oh!

1590
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,080
The note.

1591
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,560
There we go.

1592
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,220
I thought it was the...

1593
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,040
The sharp claws.

1594
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,420
This must be the crime scene.

1595
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,240
This note is curious.

1596
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,040
Curious?

1597
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,080
Let's observe you.

1598
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:20,000
Sir?

1599
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,360
Whoa!

1600
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,200
Eyebrows.

1601
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:24,660
Hmm...

1602
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,540
Oh!

1603
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:28,740
Toes.

1604
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:29,280
Worker shoes.

1605
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,400
Practical person.

1606
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:31,860
Okay.

1607
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,100
He's got his little toolbox.

1608
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,320
He's the janitor.

1609
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,340
Well, you're not...

1610
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:36,760
I'm sorry.

1611
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:37,940
I'm really sorry, actually.

1612
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,800
You have a lot of work ahead of you, mister.

1613
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,480
Oh, it's my fault.

1614
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:43,420
I'm really sorry.

1615
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:47,140
Sticker.

1616
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:48,660
Sci-fi fan.

1617
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:49,580
Oh, interesting.

1618
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,080
He's a nerd.

1619
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,480
All right.

1620
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,540
Let's talk to Margaret first.

1621
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,440
Yes, dear.

1622
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:57,740
I'm Eugene McQuacklin.

1623
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:58,760
Detective.

1624
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:01,020
And I need to ask some questions.

1625
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,400
A detective?

1626
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,300
How exciting!

1627
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,020
Everyone hide their salami.

1628
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:08,620
What's the most gruesome murder you've seen?

1629
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,120
Oh, no.

1630
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:10,440
She's in the true crime podcast.

1631
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,600
How many dead bodies have you encountered?

1632
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:17,440
I could just leave.

1633
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:17,760
Wait.

1634
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,020
Five little pigs?

1635
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,000
Teething turtles?

1636
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:24,960
What does that mean?

1637
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:25,540
I don't know.

1638
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:27,860
I don't know.

1639
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,520
Let's give her the most gruesome.

1640
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,260
No one died.

1641
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:33,800
Oh, no one died.

1642
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:38,800
I investigated a case once where five little pigs robbed a bank.

1643
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:44,440
Caught them red-handed and got myself an article in the Goose Times.

1644
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,620
The Goose Times?

1645
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,520
They called it the piggy bank case.

1646
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,020
Did someone get shot?

1647
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,400
Why do you...

1648
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,920
What if Margaret is out for blood?

1649
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:55,280
What?

1650
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:55,540
Why?

1651
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:57,700
Beaten up.

1652
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,280
Margaret wants violence.

1653
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:00,940
No.

1654
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:02,240
Hmm.

1655
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:03,960
Oh.

1656
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:04,620
Okay.

1657
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,460
Interesting.

1658
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,220
What do you think about Sophie?

1659
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,300
What do you think of Sophie Windtimer?

1660
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,840
She doesn't have the easiest life, you know.

1661
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:17,760
She just had a terrible breakup with her ex.

1662
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,140
But don't tell anyone.

1663
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:19,880
Oh.

1664
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,160
Spilling the tea.

1665
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:22,700
Margaret.

1666
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,540
Can you tell me anything about your ex?

1667
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,480
What do you think about Laura Engst?

1668
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:27,300
She probably...

1669
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:27,620
What do you...

1670
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:29,700
Oh, she's such a hard-working girl.

1671
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,060
Yeah?

1672
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:34,960
I heard she secretly studies for her online bachelor's during work.

1673
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:35,460
Ooh.

1674
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,700
Well, you're not doing the work, so...

1675
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,100
You need to keep this a secret, though.

1676
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:40,380
Dang.

1677
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:41,720
She's spilling everybody's secrets.

1678
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,400
Do you know anyone here who could have hired me?

1679
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:46,800
Hmm.

1680
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:47,500
Hmm.

1681
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:52,020
To be honest, everyone was quite shocked by the lunch theft.

1682
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,900
And no one told me they've called a detective.

1683
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,580
I don't know what's going on at all.

1684
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:58,360
Okay.

1685
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,880
Calm down, Margaret.

1686
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:00,520
Sheesh.

1687
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,460
Okay.

1688
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:01,940
You're all right.

1689
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,840
Let's add her.

1690
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,200
Margaret Whitlock.

1691
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,220
To the list.

1692
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,900
And about you, sir.

1693
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:12,480
Dishwasher's broken again.

1694
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:13,440
Broken again.

1695
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,260
Where are we?

1696
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,220
Where do we live?

1697
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,080
What's wrong with these youngsters?

1698
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,740
Don't know how to treat things with respect.

1699
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,540
With respect.

1700
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,080
Why would they put the mugs in face up?

1701
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:24,540
Okay.

1702
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,540
That's really devilish.

1703
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,200
That's really devilish, actually.

1704
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,000
That is so evil.

1705
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:30,720
Okay.

1706
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,340
What do you think of Mar...

1707
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,200
What do you think of Margaret?

1708
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:37,760
What is your relationship with Margaret Whitlock?

1709
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:38,200
Yeah.

1710
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,980
Ah, she's a true sweetheart.

1711
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,120
Ahem...

1712
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:46,280
We have our weekly mahjong evenings.

1713
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:48,620
Mah... mahjong evenings?

1714
01:08:59,090 --> 01:08:59,770
Okay.

1715
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:00,590
What...

1716
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:03,050
I'm just joking.

1717
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:03,750
Just playing Mahjong.

1718
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:04,970
Oh my gosh, is that the new...

1719
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,850
Forget Netflix and chill, everybody.

1720
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:13,090
Mahjong evenings is the new hot stuff.

1721
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:16,550
Ernst.

1722
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:27,270
Does anybody enjoy Freddy Ferderson's company?

1723
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:33,070
Huh?

1724
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,730
It's over for me.

1725
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:44,090
Oh, he doesn't like him, okay.

1726
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,290
Who hired us?

1727
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:49,550
Is that so?

1728
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:56,590
Why is there nobody who...

1729
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:58,990
What?

1730
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,330
You were doing just fine.

1731
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:08,130
I don't need no messing about our business around here.

1732
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,070
Okay, suspicious sir.

1733
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:15,010
Why wouldn't you want a detective to solve the mystery lunch disappearance?

1734
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:15,470
Huh?

1735
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:19,570
Interesting, interesting, interesting.

1736
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:21,890
Let's see.

1737
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:24,990
So, are you Rufus?

1738
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:29,610
He's our employee of the month.

1739
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:30,810
The janitor.

1740
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:32,230
And then we have one more character.

1741
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:33,730
This must be the person that hired us.

1742
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:35,930
Where else can we go?

1743
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:41,310
I guess we can ask other people about these characters.

1744
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:44,810
Such as Freddy.

1745
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:48,530
What do you think of Margaret?

1746
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:51,070
What can you tell me about Margaret Whitlock?

1747
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:55,750
She gets really angry with me when I don't return mugs to the kitchen.

1748
01:10:57,330 --> 01:10:59,810
Yeah, you have four right there and one in your hand.

1749
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:00,310
Um.

1750
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:02,870
Why don't you just return them?

1751
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:03,370
Yeah.

1752
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:04,550
I do.

1753
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:08,070
Just not every day.

1754
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:10,410
This guy is just so gross.

1755
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,010
There's bananas.

1756
01:11:13,450 --> 01:11:15,330
Why don't you just pick up your stuff?

1757
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:18,210
Me?

1758
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:19,090
No.

1759
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:20,690
Don't be messy, you guys.

1760
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:21,530
Don't be messy.

1761
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:23,910
This guy.

1762
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,070
For real.

1763
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:25,890
For real.

1764
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:30,290
I forgot, I think, to ask Margaret what her name is.

1765
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:31,610
What her opinion is of Rufus.

1766
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:33,550
Not me.

1767
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:34,210
No!

1768
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:36,850
Oh, here we go.

1769
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:39,250
Are you getting along with Rufus Sedaris?

1770
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:39,990
Uh-huh.

1771
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:43,890
You know, the two of us are from the older generation.

1772
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:45,190
Oh, but you got...

1773
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:46,010
You're young at heart.

1774
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:48,210
You got that young spunk, don't you, Margaret?

1775
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,750
Which means we understand each other well.

1776
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:51,730
Uh-huh.

1777
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:54,670
He is quite harsh towards the younger ones, though.

1778
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:56,350
Interesting.

1779
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:59,730
He's a real respect your elders kind of guy.

1780
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:00,270
I see.

1781
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:03,370
She's strong at heart.

1782
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:06,110
Oh, yeah.

1783
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:06,630
That's right.

1784
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,870
We got to figure out a way into her computer.

1785
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:12,150
What about you, sir?

1786
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:13,730
Rufus.

1787
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:15,510
What is Rufus Sedaris like?

1788
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:16,410
Sedaris.

1789
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:19,670
Not the greatest janitor.

1790
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:20,950
Then how did he get...

1791
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:23,090
Then how did he get Employee of the Month, huh?

1792
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:24,890
He came with the building.

1793
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:25,410
Oh.

1794
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:27,390
That's it?

1795
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:28,830
That's it.

1796
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:29,710
That's it.

1797
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:30,090
Okay.

1798
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:34,610
Poor Laura is so underappreciated at this place.

1799
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:37,270
Are you okay, Laura?

1800
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:37,830
Do you need...

1801
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:38,910
Do you need a second?

1802
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:44,750
So the password hint was me in sexy aliens, which...

1803
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:48,930
Still...

1804
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:49,930
Look at this.

1805
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:56,130
This is like when grandma discovers filters, Snapchat filters and stuff.

1806
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,860
Me in sexy aliens.

1807
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,500
I'm so...

1808
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,840
Margaret got some dubious activities.

1809
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:17,980
Yeah.

1810
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:19,220
Someone did like sci-fi.

1811
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:22,960
That's crazy.

1812
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,440
Yeah.

1813
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:26,180
Surprise.

1814
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:26,840
Let's see.

1815
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:27,480
What do we have here?

1816
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,780
The client.

1817
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,120
Blank hired the duck detective because his her blank was blank.

1818
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:40,720
The lunch was stolen by a coworker known as the salami bandit.

1819
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:42,760
We know that a little bit.

1820
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,420
More suspects.

1821
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:45,460
Oh.

1822
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:50,400
Margaret is the sheep who works in customer service.

1823
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:55,380
Penguin is the salami bandit.

1824
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:57,740
Rufus works as the janitor.

1825
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:58,520
Buffalo.

1826
01:13:58,580 --> 01:13:59,180
Okay.

1827
01:13:59,240 --> 01:13:59,680
Let's go outside.

1828
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:00,840
Maybe we'll find him out there.

1829
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:04,560
Here we go.

1830
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:07,060
Yeah.

1831
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,300
I knew that the penguin is a Star Trek fan.

1832
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:09,960
So...

1833
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,780
Oh, there he is.

1834
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,020
So he'll probably have the answer.

1835
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:21,740
The cold air ruffled my feathers and I wondered what kind of sorry soul was standing all alone in the rain.

1836
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,460
I need the soundtrack for this game.

1837
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:24,880
It's so good.

1838
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:25,260
I'm sorry.

1839
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:26,780
What else?

1840
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:27,760
Is anything over here?

1841
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,180
No.

1842
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:30,680
What's this note?

1843
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:31,900
How mysterious.

1844
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:33,560
I want to read it.

1845
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,960
Why are there post-it notes everywhere?

1846
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:37,760
What's this?

1847
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,860
Someone left their bag here.

1848
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:40,560
Ugh.

1849
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,140
It's full of dirty gym clothes.

1850
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:46,600
Nice.

1851
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,040
Duffle bag.

1852
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:48,600
Get.

1853
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,200
For my own personal collection, of course.

1854
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:52,900
Let's see.

1855
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:53,700
Oh.

1856
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:56,620
Well...

1857
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:56,880
Oh.

1858
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,160
Well-proportioned nose.

1859
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,180
Handsome.

1860
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,700
Look at the top of his head.

1861
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,420
So neat and clean.

1862
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:03,540
Oh.

1863
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:07,520
Hands and pockets.

1864
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,840
Bad manners.

1865
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,060
What?

1866
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:09,920
That's bad manners?

1867
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,420
Is it really?

1868
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:13,980
Hands and pockets are...

1869
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:14,420
Oh.

1870
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:15,100
Boris.

1871
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,520
Embroidery.

1872
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,040
First name.

1873
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:17,920
Boris.

1874
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
New character.

1875
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:20,500
Let's go.

1876
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:21,940
Hey, man.

1877
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,280
This isn't the bus stop.

1878
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,480
You'll have to walk south to the central bus station.

1879
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,020
Everybody's got an accent.

1880
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:28,340
What?

1881
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:31,060
I'm not here to take a bus.

1882
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:31,840
Yeah.

1883
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:32,420
I'm a detective.

1884
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:33,540
Hey, man.

1885
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:39,660
It's cold out, but if I go inside, I have to face Sophie.

1886
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,900
Is that your ex?

1887
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,420
What's your relationship?

1888
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,200
What do you think of Sophie Windheimer?

1889
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:46,560
Yeah.

1890
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:49,040
He sucks.

1891
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,260
Man, I wish she'd let me talk to her.

1892
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:55,780
What does that mean?

1893
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:59,580
Do you like Freddy Fredersen?

1894
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,020
It's rude in certain situations.

1895
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:02,480
Really.

1896
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:03,440
Is it?

1897
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,280
He's a pretty funny dude.

1898
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:05,560
He's a pretty funny dude.

1899
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,980
Loves to rant about detective novels.

1900
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:08,660
Okay.

1901
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:12,460
What do you know about Rufus Sedaris?

1902
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,220
I don't think he likes me very much, to be honest.

1903
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,140
But then, it doesn't feel like he likes anyone at this office.

1904
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,280
You're rude.

1905
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:21,560
You're a rude youngster.

1906
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,300
Except for Margaret, I guess.

1907
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,700
Do you think they have a thing going on?

1908
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:26,560
Gossip.

1909
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,000
Gossip.

1910
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:27,500
Gossip.

1911
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:27,940
Gossip.

1912
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,040
I don't work here.

1913
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,740
I thought you were a detective.

1914
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:32,320
What?

1915
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:33,980
Okay.

1916
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,380
I'm investigating a case here at Bearbus.

1917
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,360
Oh.

1918
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,420
Do you mean the lunch that got stolen?

1919
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:39,900
Yes.

1920
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:40,580
Exactly.

1921
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,540
Do you know who called me?

1922
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:43,600
Nah.

1923
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:45,540
Too busy minding my own business.

1924
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:46,480
Uh-huh.

1925
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,360
I don't talk much with the customer service folks.

1926
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:52,240
What?

1927
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:52,920
So, what?

1928
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:53,540
Are you a bus driver?

1929
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,200
Do you know anything about this bag?

1930
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:57,140
Oh.

1931
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,400
Mahjonging all over the place?

1932
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,360
You.

1933
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:02,560
You.

1934
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:02,700
You.

1935
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,360
You.

1936
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:03,380
You.

1937
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:03,460
What is it?

1938
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,020
He's going to ride it.

1939
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:04,100
He's going to run her.

1940
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:04,960
He's going to run her.

1941
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:05,560
He's going to run her.

1942
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:07,260
Oh gosh.

1943
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,100
East, West, North, South.

1944
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,460
Oh man.

1945
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,420
It's really strange.

1946
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,320
Things in it disappeared.

1947
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:18,180
Rritty!

1948
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:21,360
He's reaching all over the place.

1949
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:25,620
Bala!

1950
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,680
Thanks for the donut.

1951
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:27,120
Thank ya.

1952
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,340
And others appeared.

1953
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,280
Very suspicious.

1954
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,400
Very suspicious.

1955
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:34,920
What are you going to do?

1956
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,020
It's true.

1957
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,440
Why is everybody so round?

1958
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,060
Nobody is giving a solid answer.

1959
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:51,640
Oh.

1960
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:53,380
Okay.

1961
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,880
So typically they each have like a... what's the word?

1962
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,680
A two-dialogue.

1963
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,820
So he is our main bus driver.

1964
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,240
Boris Petrovich.

1965
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:08,780
Ducks in a row.

1966
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,260
Fill out all suspects' names.

1967
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:10,740
Let's go!

1968
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:13,440
And here.

1969
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:13,760
Oh.

1970
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,280
More suspects.

1971
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,320
Boris is the buffalo.

1972
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,380
Is a bus driver.

1973
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:21,840
Awesome.

1974
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,060
Uh-huh.

1975
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:32,320
The only person we haven't been able to talk to.

1976
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,160
That could tell us if they hired us is Laura.

1977
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,380
Because she's been so busy.

1978
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,340
So I wonder if it's her.

1979
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:44,040
Nice!

1980
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,500
So it was Laura who called me.

1981
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,380
I needed to discuss the case with her.

1982
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,760
You're my client?

1983
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:55,720
Why didn't you tell me?

1984
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,240
Yeah!

1985
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,100
Can I put you on hold for a second?

1986
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,480
What?

1987
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,700
You should have told me you're the duck detective.

1988
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:05,800
I did say.

1989
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,520
I'm a duck.

1990
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,760
I'm wearing a trench coat.

1991
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,560
So is Freddy getting fired or what?

1992
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:14,080
Ooh.

1993
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,520
I'm working on it.

1994
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:18,960
Dang.

1995
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,240
It can't be that hard.

1996
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,680
Sorry I'm back.

1997
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:26,060
Yes, let me walk you through the booking process.

1998
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:30,380
It was time that I found out what happened with the lunch theft.

1999
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:33,500
And what they were planning in the kitchen.

2000
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,420
In the kitchen.

2001
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:38,960
Blank is planning a blank blank blank for blank.

2002
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:49,200
Margaret is planning a surprise birthday party for Sophie.

2003
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:59,540
Margaret was planning a surprise birthday party for Sophie.

2004
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:00,460
Yes.

2005
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,300
I see.

2006
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,280
She didn't actually forget her birthday.

2007
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:10,600
Elementary, my dear wisp.

2008
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:14,240
How did you know?

2009
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:15,880
I'm telling you.

2010
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,120
I'm a duck detective.

2011
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,960
Oh yeah, there's other stuff here too.

2012
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:28,500
Let's see.

2013
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:29,680
The culprit.

2014
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:33,360
Blank is being blank by blank because Blank picked up the blank blank.

2015
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:41,520
So and so is being framed by blank because Blank picked up the blank blank.

2016
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,960
The wrong mug.

2017
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,340
I wonder.

2018
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:53,120
I wonder if Freddy is being framed by someone because...

2019
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:54,560
Wait.

2020
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,080
Hmm.

2021
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,120
We still don't know this one quite yet.

2022
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,340
We still don't know this one quite yet.

2023
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:03,120
I need to get into her computer.

2024
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,960
So I can see any evidence she has in her emails.

2025
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,320
Noon night sign.

2026
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,320
Welcome to Bamboo Shep.

2027
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:12,840
Thank you.

2028
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:15,160
Let's see.

2029
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,560
Do you know whose bag this is?

2030
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,760
Isn't that Freddy's?

2031
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:24,460
Freddy's bag.

2032
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,300
So it was swapped out.

2033
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,980
He has the bag.

2034
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,320
His bag is actually the bag with the...

2035
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,760
With the gym clothes.

2036
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:33,840
But they swapped it out.

2037
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:38,080
Do you know anything about this bag?

2038
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,800
Why are you going around pushing bags into people's faces?

2039
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,760
What's that awful smell?

2040
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:48,300
Embrace it.

2041
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,000
It's dirty gym clothes.

2042
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,160
Embrace it.

2043
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:53,140
The bag of 87.

2044
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,610
Oh, I doubt they want...

2045
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:00,170
Yeah.

2046
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:00,750
Okay.

2047
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:01,710
We looked in through there.

2048
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:07,010
Oh, that's so sweet that she's actually doing surprise party though.

2049
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:13,550
Oh, let's ask Freddy about his bag.

2050
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:15,630
Is this your bag?

2051
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:16,290
Huh?

2052
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:16,950
Huh?

2053
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:17,590
No.

2054
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:18,730
Mine's over there.

2055
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:21,030
The one with all the salami?

2056
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:23,910
You know, the salami bandit?

2057
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:24,310
Yeah.

2058
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:27,110
Why do you need so much salami?

2059
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:28,290
It's not mine.

2060
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:29,550
It was just there.

2061
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:33,310
A really nice surprise.

2062
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:33,950
Oh.

2063
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:35,750
Nice.

2064
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:40,190
Do you get along with Boris Petrovich?

2065
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:41,550
He's a chill guy.

2066
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:44,790
I take the bus sometimes to go to bouldering conventions.

2067
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:46,070
And then we get to chat.

2068
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:47,470
Bouldering conventions?

2069
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:50,490
What is bouldering?

2070
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:51,890
Is that climbing or...

2071
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:53,890
What is bouldering?

2072
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:54,330
Bouldering.

2073
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,420
Oh, Freddy.

2074
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,140
Rock climbing?

2075
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:01,560
Okay.

2076
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,900
It's climbing without a harness.

2077
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,780
Yo, Freddy goes hard.

2078
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,280
Freddy's a bit of an adrenaline junkie.

2079
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,760
What kind of a person is Boris Petrovich?

2080
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:13,860
Ugh.

2081
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:16,640
I don't know what I saw in him.

2082
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:17,560
They were.

2083
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,880
That is their ex.

2084
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,080
I mean, I guess he's good looking.

2085
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,280
But...

2086
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:24,820
Hahaha.

2087
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,220
Good evening, Officer Brent.

2088
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,100
How are you doing?

2089
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:28,100
I'm great.

2090
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,040
Thank you.

2091
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,520
My god.

2092
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,440
Is he boring?

2093
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,200
Oh.

2094
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,500
How are you getting on with Margaret Whitlock?

2095
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,300
She's sweet and all.

2096
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:39,380
But...

2097
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:39,960
But?

2098
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:42,480
She can't keep her mouth shut.

2099
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:42,980
Okay.

2100
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:43,700
That is so true.

2101
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,840
It seems like the office knows more about my personal life than me.

2102
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:48,680
Than me.

2103
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:50,280
The office.

2104
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,500
I wonder how this guy is doing out here.

2105
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,340
I can't leave now.

2106
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:53,660
Oh.

2107
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:54,800
I need to solve...

2108
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:55,280
Just kidding.

2109
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:06,110
Boris is into tall chicks.

2110
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:07,190
Spaced.

2111
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:08,790
Okay.

2112
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:11,070
Let's see.

2113
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:15,070
Let's go on in.

2114
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:23,300
What can you tell me about Boris Petrovich?

2115
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:27,140
He's... not the most reliable worker.

2116
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,660
But it's difficult finding replacements nowadays.

2117
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,660
Mm-hmm.

2118
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:34,920
Mm-hmm.

2119
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:37,120
We still don't know what's behind his...

2120
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,160
This, you know?

2121
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:42,040
What are you doing with my family's portrait?

2122
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:42,420
Oh!

2123
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,420
Sorry.

2124
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:46,520
It's just admiring your lovely...

2125
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,360
Your lovely life.

2126
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,140
You know?

2127
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:55,940
Just admiring your lovely... wife.

2128
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:57,860
But PCs are.

2129
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:59,300
They only have that surprising.

2130
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:01,640
How do I get in?

2131
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:05,660
Accessible.

2132
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:08,760
Maybe we don't access it.

2133
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:09,500
Maybe...

2134
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:12,960
Maybe...

2135
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:14,400
Maybe...

2136
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:17,600
Someone else accessed it because they knew the hint.

2137
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:18,880
A.K.A.

2138
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,320
our little penguin friend over here.

2139
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:25,080
Maybe he got onto our computer to do something.

2140
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,240
With the note.

2141
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:29,540
Salami.

2142
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:30,920
And it's the sharp claws.

2143
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,800
That makes me think that they're framing.

2144
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,300
Freddy.

2145
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:33,840
You know?

2146
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:34,560
Well, I mean...

2147
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,080
They are framing Freddy.

2148
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:36,760
Because...

2149
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,540
They gave him the salami.

2150
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:39,480
So...

2151
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:42,820
Wait a minute.

2152
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,020
It already wants me to...

2153
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:44,180
Okay.

2154
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:44,680
Oh...

2155
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:45,960
Um...

2156
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,500
It already...

2157
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,300
It already wants me to solve it.

2158
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:49,640
Oh...

2159
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:50,320
Okay.

2160
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:51,080
Um...

2161
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:51,920
Freddy...

2162
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,680
Is being framed by...

2163
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,040
Um...

2164
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:58,260
Uh...

2165
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:58,600
Uh...

2166
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,100
Uh...

2167
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:02,080
By...

2168
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:02,780
Uh...

2169
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:03,680
Laurel?

2170
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,180
Because...

2171
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:05,640
Freddy...

2172
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,160
Two or fewer things are wrong.

2173
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,810
You have all the information.

2174
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:22,570
Just think back.

2175
01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:31,490
Think mug equals lunch.

2176
01:26:34,210 --> 01:26:34,770
No.

2177
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:35,810
Well, he had the...

2178
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:37,830
She was so mad about him getting...

2179
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:39,390
Grabbing her mug all the time.

2180
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:39,690
Right?

2181
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:42,110
Mug?

2182
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:42,530
Not back?

2183
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:45,370
No.

2184
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:46,930
I don't think it was the wrong bag.

2185
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:47,350
Right?

2186
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:51,670
Or is it the wrong...

2187
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:51,790
Okay.

2188
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:52,050
Wait.

2189
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,300
It's so clean.

2190
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,620
Do you know who else was clean?

2191
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:15,680
Margaret.

2192
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:17,480
She was also clean.

2193
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:18,480
And divorced.

2194
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:21,800
Hmm...

2195
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:24,120
Hmm...

2196
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:26,650
Yeah.

2197
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:27,590
His gym bag...

2198
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:28,830
Or his dirty clothes...

2199
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:29,070
Yeah.

2200
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:30,870
So, Freddy picked up the wrong bag.

2201
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:48,060
I love how Bearbus...

2202
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,240
He's just being framed by Bearbus.

2203
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,700
Everybody is out to get him.

2204
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,140
Everybody hates Freddy.

2205
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,640
Everybody wants Freddy out of here.

2206
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:05,860
No...

2207
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:12,260
Why am I blanking out on this so much?

2208
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:13,280
Okay.

2209
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:13,580
Hold on.

2210
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,400
I think maybe because I'm...

2211
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:21,020
Okay.

2212
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,200
There's Margaret's sandwich.

2213
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:24,460
Why is it wide open like that?

2214
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:25,880
R.S.

2215
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:26,500
is...

2216
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,200
Is...

2217
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:29,760
The janitor.

2218
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,540
What's that sound?

2219
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:36,760
And then...

2220
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:38,540
This is...

2221
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,580
This is...

2222
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:43,680
Laura's...

2223
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:50,280
Oh, they're brewing coffee.

2224
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:52,880
Oh, I hear it.

2225
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:53,340
Yeah, you're right.

2226
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:57,060
Why am I blanking so much with this?

2227
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:58,660
Hmm...

2228
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:04,710
So, maybe Freddy is being framed by...

2229
01:29:07,450 --> 01:29:07,850
Um...

2230
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:11,150
It wouldn't be Manfred, right?

2231
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:16,270
But...

2232
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:16,570
But...

2233
01:29:16,570 --> 01:29:17,170
Would it be...

2234
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:18,250
Not the wrong bat.

2235
01:29:18,510 --> 01:29:18,590
Huh?

2236
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:20,950
Ugh...

2237
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:21,310
They...

2238
01:29:21,950 --> 01:29:22,350
Hmm...

2239
01:29:25,730 --> 01:29:26,890
Use your brain, Mint.

2240
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:27,110
I don't know.

2241
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:28,590
I have no brain cells right now.

2242
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:31,710
Just look through the names.

2243
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:39,690
I don't think it's Boris.

2244
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:40,850
Is it Rufus?

2245
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,620
Email bag X.

2246
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,780
I mean, he picked up the wrong X.

2247
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:01,550
Unless it's Manfred's lunch.

2248
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:03,430
It's available...

2249
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:07,930
The game is like...

2250
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:10,250
By the way, this is so wrong.

2251
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:11,510
Just please give up.

2252
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:13,130
Okay.

2253
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:16,230
I think it...

2254
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:16,930
I think it is...

2255
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:18,430
The bag, then.

2256
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:28,350
Time for...

2257
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:29,790
Wait, what happens if I do...

2258
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:32,130
Oh, it doesn't change anything.

2259
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:33,910
We're fine.

2260
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:38,640
Why bag?

2261
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:39,200
You are...

2262
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,080
What?

2263
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:40,540
What?

2264
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:41,620
What?

2265
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,380
You were about...

2266
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:45,740
You were...

2267
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:46,020
You were...

2268
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,060
You were hired to solve the missing lunch.

2269
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,500
Then what does the bag have to do with it?

2270
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,120
I think they just switched out the bags, right?

2271
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:56,760
So, Freddy is being framed...

2272
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:58,740
By...

2273
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,100
Is it Margaret?

2274
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:03,740
You evil, conniving sheep.

2275
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:10,980
What do you carry lunches in?

2276
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:11,960
A bag.

2277
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:16,160
Or your hands.

2278
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:16,740
I don't know.

2279
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,000
Why am I?

2280
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,040
Why can't I figure this out?

2281
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:22,500
Am I stupid?

2282
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:29,160
I think about the lunch was stolen by who...

2283
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,360
Well, I don't know.

2284
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,120
Who would have won it?

2285
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,320
Because each person in here are...

2286
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,720
He has his own lunch.

2287
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:39,340
Margaret has her own lunch.

2288
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,080
This is...

2289
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,580
Well, I'm assuming it's Laura's lunch.

2290
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:48,860
I'm assuming it's Laura's lunch, but what if it's not?

2291
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:49,160
Is it...

2292
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:58,790
Try looking through all the names, nouns, and choices.

2293
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:02,850
Suspicious.

2294
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,410
I think it's framed.

2295
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:09,770
By...

2296
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:14,900
The salami bandit.

2297
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:19,540
Oh wait.

2298
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,080
Freddie!

2299
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:36,920
Framed by Freddie!

2300
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:41,140
Freddie is being framed by Freddie because Freddie picked up the wrong...

2301
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:53,010
And who didn't like who, right?

2302
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:55,830
Bad manners.

2303
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:57,950
Maybe Boris ate the lunch.

2304
01:32:57,950 --> 01:32:58,390
Who knows?

2305
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:00,430
She also has bad habits.

2306
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:01,830
Lame.

2307
01:33:01,970 --> 01:33:02,910
So sad.

2308
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:04,310
But he has bad eyesight.

2309
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:06,690
So he picked the wrong thing, right?

2310
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:07,950
On accident, probably.

2311
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:12,290
It was Freddie all this time.

2312
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:13,850
Don't trust anybody.

2313
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:14,790
Not even.

2314
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:15,330
Not even yourself.

2315
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,480
So maybe he is being framed by Boris.

2316
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:48,040
One day he'll complete this puzzle.

2317
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:50,480
It's because I did the other one so quickly.

2318
01:33:58,530 --> 01:33:59,770
Laura does hate Freddie.

2319
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:03,610
Look at the pits at this point.

2320
01:34:03,650 --> 01:34:03,990
It's painful.

2321
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:05,010
I'm sorry!

2322
01:34:07,490 --> 01:34:08,410
Laura wants...

2323
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:09,390
I tried though!

2324
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:10,210
I tried Laura!

2325
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:13,010
Freddie is being framed by Laura.

2326
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:14,330
But I don't...

2327
01:34:14,330 --> 01:34:15,210
It didn't work!

2328
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:17,350
What?

2329
01:34:17,570 --> 01:34:19,330
Keep cooking but don't listen to the haters.

2330
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:20,810
At this point, I have no idea.

2331
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:22,590
At this point, I'm so confused.

2332
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:23,610
If it's the bag.

2333
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:24,310
If it's a...

2334
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:25,330
If it's a bag.

2335
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:26,170
If it's a mug.

2336
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:28,050
If it's a salami.

2337
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:28,770
If it's a lunch.

2338
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:29,610
I have no idea!

2339
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:32,330
I have no idea!

2340
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:32,430
I have no idea!

2341
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:43,850
Is it because the salami man picked the wrong lunch?

2342
01:34:44,610 --> 01:34:45,070
Nope.

2343
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:46,230
Three things must be wrong.

2344
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:46,650
So no.

2345
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:48,110
Oh, whoops.

2346
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:49,010
Wait.

2347
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:50,470
Bag.

2348
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,700
You gotta think like a dog.

2349
01:34:58,960 --> 01:34:59,740
I'm not a dog!

2350
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:00,420
I'm a ghost!

2351
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:01,720
This is a twist.

2352
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:02,760
The double cross is...

2353
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:03,280
This is a hoop!

2354
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,100
This is a hoop!

2355
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:06,520
The dog did it.

2356
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,440
Oh, did we try clicking on that book on the desk some more?

2357
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,380
Is this all because I didn't sign the book?

2358
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:15,520
Dang it.

2359
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,320
Call the colonel.

2360
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,840
I don't think the hints are literally gonna give anything though.

2361
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:23,700
Detective work isn't easy.

2362
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:24,960
Ponder details.

2363
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,120
The thing that bothered me in particular was...

2364
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:28,000
The culprit.

2365
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:32,140
To figure out the situation about the culprit, I had to consider...

2366
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,380
Important objects.

2367
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:35,880
What objects stood out in this case?

2368
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:40,700
I had to check again which objects the people involved interacted with.

2369
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:45,760
I had to take into consideration who the note in the fridge was signed by.

2370
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:48,820
And why they decided to take action.

2371
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:54,580
I had a feeling something bigger was going on than meets the eye.

2372
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:59,080
Thanks, Ducktective.

2373
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:01,020
Clearly Ocelot must be responsible.

2374
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:04,040
Wait, so...

2375
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:07,140
Um...

2376
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:12,090
So who signed the note?

2377
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:13,890
That's a great question.

2378
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:18,190
This little...

2379
01:36:19,110 --> 01:36:20,150
This... this...

2380
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:22,530
I thought... honestly...

2381
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:25,670
If you had told me it was like a poorly drawn sun...

2382
01:36:25,670 --> 01:36:28,150
Like a sunrise, I would have believed you.

2383
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:30,910
But it's a claw.

2384
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:33,230
I thought it was a sun at first.

2385
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:34,750
So who has the claws?

2386
01:36:37,050 --> 01:36:38,150
Freddy's got claws.

2387
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:40,890
Manfred's got claws.

2388
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:41,790
Doesn't he?

2389
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:43,850
I have to go back and look at everybody's claws.

2390
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:48,190
She's got divorced.

2391
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:52,810
This guy has no hand... wait...

2392
01:36:52,810 --> 01:36:54,170
He's got claws!

2393
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:58,350
Everybody's got claws, I think.

2394
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:06,670
Oops, sorry.

2395
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:10,490
I pressed the wrong button.

2396
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:11,470
Or did I?

2397
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:12,830
Maybe I pressed the right button.

2398
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:16,950
Oh yeah, this is baby food.

2399
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,730
I was like, wait, he's got evidence on him.

2400
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:21,510
I'm so glad...

2401
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:23,150
Vint hasn't realized that I'm Freddy.

2402
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:35,830
Oh, this way.

2403
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:36,690
Hold on.

2404
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:39,250
Laura, let me see your hands.

2405
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:41,790
Oh, those are really claw-like.

2406
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:43,150
But why would she steal...

2407
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:43,790
See, that's...

2408
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:44,710
Why would... I mean...

2409
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:45,770
She's stealing your old lunch.

2410
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:47,510
But she's also trying to get this guy fired.

2411
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:49,710
She's like, fire Freddy, fire Freddy.

2412
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:52,790
She hates him.

2413
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:11,900
Oh, that's a caps lock.

2414
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,760
So I feel like it's gotta be Laura, right?

2415
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:16,740
Because...

2416
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,380
Because he picked up the mug.

2417
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,320
I feel like that is correct.

2418
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:23,500
That Freddy is being framed by Laura because Freddy took her mug again.

2419
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:25,820
But I don't understand why it's wrong.

2420
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:29,200
What Freddy do?

2421
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:30,280
He...

2422
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:31,960
He took her mug.

2423
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:35,760
And she said, I hate when people take my mug.

2424
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:40,370
It's obvious.

2425
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:41,190
The duck detective.

2426
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:41,670
But...

2427
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:43,730
Planted the evidence himself.

2428
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:45,090
Then gave himself amnesia.

2429
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:45,790
The perfect crime.

2430
01:38:47,890 --> 01:38:49,110
You're too far ahead.

2431
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:54,620
What do you mean?

2432
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:56,620
Change the name?

2433
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:03,000
The salami bandit is being...

2434
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:04,460
I

2435
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:09,800
feel like it has to be...

2436
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,220
Like, being suspicious.

2437
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:12,240
By who?

2438
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:12,400
I don't know.

2439
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:13,540
That doesn't make any sense.

2440
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:15,280
Someone is being suspicious...

2441
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,660
By someone?

2442
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:17,620
That doesn't make any sense.

2443
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:23,420
The answer is more simple than you think.

2444
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:24,100
What?

2445
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:25,680
Just tell me at this point.

2446
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:31,140
Positively, these are the five gifts.

2447
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:44,330
Oh my god.

2448
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:49,650
Now it's three things wrong.

2449
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:55,890
I hope the...

2450
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:56,570
I hope the...

2451
01:39:56,570 --> 01:39:57,250
I hope the...

2452
01:39:58,170 --> 01:40:00,050
The devs are not watching this right now.

2453
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:04,030
How am I overcomplicating it?

2454
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:09,050
Please, I have a meeting in an hour.

2455
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:14,850
Oh my god.

2456
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:23,730
There's only so many things.

2457
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:25,750
I feel like framed makes the most sense, right?

2458
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:29,050
The duck detective is being framed.

2459
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:38,390
Freddy is the correct thing here.

2460
01:40:41,690 --> 01:40:42,250
Suspicious...

2461
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:52,200
It's actually a good sound.

2462
01:41:57,260 --> 01:42:00,200
I don't know how to simplify this anymore than I already have.

2463
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:04,640
I don't know how to simplify this more than I already have.

2464
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:08,540
This is why I gave up the life of being a detective.

2465
01:42:19,190 --> 01:42:20,490
I'm gonna go get more tea.

2466
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:21,370
I'll be right back.

2467
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:23,210
I'll be right back.

2468
01:42:23,230 --> 01:42:24,550
I'm gonna just go get more tea.

2469
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:58,120
I'm back.

2470
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:04,180
Okay.

2471
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:08,140
Okay.

2472
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:09,840
Thank you.

2473
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:11,180
Oh.

2474
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:12,740
Wrong thing.

2475
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:14,200
Oh.

2476
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:14,920
This too.

2477
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:17,620
Did you catch any fish?

2478
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:20,720
I got a whole boatload.

2479
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,080
A whole boatload.

2480
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:26,400
Okay.

2481
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,220
Back to my...

2482
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:32,880
Sorry.

2483
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:35,500
Tara just messaged me something really stupid.

2484
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:42,940
It was the Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick.

2485
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:43,880
I knew it.

2486
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:44,680
I knew it.

2487
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:45,300
I knew it.

2488
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:47,320
Oh my gosh.

2489
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,580
Will the fish fit in your hat?

2490
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:51,840
No.

2491
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:53,400
They're really huge fish.

2492
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,320
Why would they fit in my hat?

2493
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:55,980
That makes no sense.

2494
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:00,130
Okay.

2495
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:08,780
So is it?

2496
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:10,740
The salami bandit?

2497
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:12,260
Picked up...

2498
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:12,620
No.

2499
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:15,780
Is he being framed maybe by the salami bandit?

2500
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:17,680
Oh god.

2501
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:17,940
Oh my god.

2502
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:18,620
That's what they're talking about.

2503
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:18,680
Oh.

2504
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:23,120
I'm letting myself...

2505
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:26,560
Oh, you were.

2506
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:28,960
A salami bandit.

2507
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:29,160
Sure.

2508
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:32,120
It's...

2509
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:33,040
He's a salami bandit.

2510
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:33,180
Like...

2511
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:34,940
Oh...

2512
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:40,900
He can't

2513
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:03,260
be a salami bandit.

2514
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:06,860
He's a salami bandit.

2515
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:07,620
Oh, I knew it.

2516
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:07,820
It's like his uniform was...

2517
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:08,720
Yeah.

2518
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:08,940
Salami bandit.

2519
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:09,620
Yeah.

2520
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,440
Salami bandit.

2521
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:15,780
THAT'S WHAT I SAID!

2522
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:47,960
The bandit!

2523
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:50,180
Oh, I almost said the sausage bandit.

2524
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:51,440
I can't even remember.

2525
01:47:56,820 --> 01:48:00,240
Why didn't you just say, hey, that's my bag instead?

2526
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:06,760
Why didn't the salami bandit just say, hey man, that's my bag.

2527
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:11,800
Oh my god.

2528
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:12,940
Thank you for that.

2529
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:15,640
Super detective, you're a mystery.

2530
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:18,320
Your investigative skills are second to many, first to none.

2531
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:23,560
Oh god.

2532
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,580
Yeah, resting your voice, by the way.

2533
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:29,340
Man, my throat has been really bad lately.

2534
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:30,880
Also, I wonder why.

2535
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:37,300
Surprise!

2536
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:43,460
Surprise!

2537
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,320
Uh, no way.

2538
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:52,180
This is... all for me?

2539
01:48:59,340 --> 01:48:59,700
Huh?

2540
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:01,540
A letter?

2541
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,420
It's more sala- oh!

2542
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:06,760
Oh no.

2543
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:08,580
Salami?

2544
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:10,020
What a terrible present.

2545
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:12,960
No, you silly idiot!

2546
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:16,860
The real present got stolen and switched for salami!

2547
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:18,400
Fuck it.

2548
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:20,440
The salami bag!

2549
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:20,960
I'll get you!

2550
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:22,180
That thing's for the five gifted.

2551
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:25,500
I saw an awful lot of high grade salami in Fredderson's bag.

2552
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:29,860
That's really suspicious that you would immediately name him.

2553
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:39,820
You screamed about Freddy being framed just now, right as I was rewatching the part from yesterday's podcast episode, where you started yelling, Freddy, his name is Freddy!

2554
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:45,360
And now there's no question who the perpetrator is!

2555
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:49,140
I've been telling you all along, we can't trust Fredderson!

2556
01:49:53,220 --> 01:50:01,040
What are you talking about?

2557
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:01,760
She's crying!

2558
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:05,280
She's crying!

2559
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:10,680
So, Sophie received the following presents.

2560
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,700
Anyway, oh wait.

2561
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,040
Oh, we did all of this.

2562
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:25,420
Just kidding.

2563
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,440
The moment you said surprise, my browser decided to reset itself.

2564
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:34,000
Haunted.

2565
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:37,740
Yeah!

2566
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:40,300
Who messes with someone's birthday?

2567
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:41,480
Let's see.

2568
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:45,320
A plushie.

2569
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:46,500
Ooh!

2570
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,020
Limited edition.

2571
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:50,880
Where did we see the cat plushie before?

2572
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,100
It's a heart-shaped necklace.

2573
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:55,440
Looks tacky.

2574
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:58,060
That's probably Boris.

2575
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:02,700
Wait, this is the sexy alien book, right?

2576
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:04,600
Sexy aliens won my number!

2577
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:14,860
Captain Brightbeak stared deep into the alien's eyes.

2578
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:18,780
There were twelve of them, and they were red.

2579
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:21,200
The eyes, not the aliens.

2580
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:25,600
All the aliens were blue, and there were forty-three.

2581
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:33,480
All of them wore shiny metal armor, which shined like something shiny made of curved metal.

2582
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:35,860
The lead alien stepped forward.

2583
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:42,760
Captain Brightbeak could tell it was the lead alien because it was the one which stepped forward.

2584
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:47,880
It was also the most beautiful, the only one with purple eyes.

2585
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:51,280
It made a noise that sounded a bit like talking.

2586
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:56,500
From a hole that looked a bit like a pretty lady's mouth.

2587
01:51:56,980 --> 01:52:06,220
The translation device the captain had invented word into action, translating the words into words he could understand.

2588
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:08,780
Hey, you look cute.

2589
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:12,420
A mechanical voice whispered into his ear.

2590
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:14,740
Can I get your number?

2591
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:16,900
Why is that page 252?

2592
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,620
621 total pages!

2593
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:23,540
Also, that name...

2594
01:52:25,220 --> 01:52:28,300
Isn't that Rufus' last name?

2595
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:30,500
Or am I stupid?

2596
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:33,500
Questionable title.

2597
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:34,420
Adult novel.

2598
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:37,320
Oh.

2599
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:38,240
Oh god.

2600
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:40,960
What did I just read?

2601
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:44,720
Yeah, I want some more.

2602
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:54,830
Buong... Buong... Buong... Buongiorno, everyone.

2603
01:52:56,570 --> 01:52:57,330
Everyone.

2604
01:52:57,370 --> 01:52:58,330
Not just Sophie.

2605
01:52:58,470 --> 01:52:59,030
Weird message.

2606
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:00,390
Also, E is underlined.

2607
01:53:03,210 --> 01:53:03,970
B...

2608
01:53:06,890 --> 01:53:11,650
Quite unbelievable, I entered the office really easily.

2609
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:12,070
Lol.

2610
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:14,210
Sayonara, edgelords.

2611
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:39,210
I think

2612
01:53:46,050 --> 01:53:51,250
it's Boris gave the necklace and then something got stolen.

2613
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:52,210
Let's talk.

2614
01:53:52,510 --> 01:53:55,090
Do you think she liked my present?

2615
01:53:55,350 --> 01:54:01,470
I mean, now she's crying, but I think I saw a sparkle in her eyes when she opened mine.

2616
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:04,590
I should really get back to work.

2617
01:54:06,010 --> 01:54:06,570
Yeah.

2618
01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:07,690
Oh, whoops.

2619
01:54:08,410 --> 01:54:08,970
Depressed.

2620
01:54:09,290 --> 01:54:10,510
Do you think I...

2621
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:11,470
Oh, wait.

2622
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:11,750
I should...

2623
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:12,750
It's a...

2624
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:13,170
Oh, it's R.

2625
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:13,610
My bad.

2626
01:54:13,930 --> 01:54:14,690
This one.

2627
01:54:14,910 --> 01:54:17,150
Can you tell me something about this letter?

2628
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:17,990
About this letter?

2629
01:54:18,210 --> 01:54:20,430
Sophie won't even talk to me about it.

2630
01:54:20,470 --> 01:54:21,570
I don't know what to do.

2631
01:54:26,590 --> 01:54:28,450
And she won't talk to me either.

2632
01:54:29,310 --> 01:54:30,330
Or her.

2633
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:32,130
Okay.

2634
01:54:32,670 --> 01:54:33,590
Let's keep going.

2635
01:54:33,730 --> 01:54:34,310
Let's ask other...

2636
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:35,690
Is this Hades too?

2637
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:39,330
What do you have to say about it, huh?

2638
01:54:40,810 --> 01:54:41,330
So...

2639
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:46,390
What happens to the cake now?

2640
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:49,940
Rufus.

2641
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:51,720
Oh my gosh.

2642
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:52,580
I almost just spilled something.

2643
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:53,220
Rufus.

2644
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:55,660
What do you think about this letter?

2645
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:56,620
Hmm.

2646
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:57,560
Um...

2647
01:54:58,180 --> 01:55:00,760
People don't know how to write letters by hand anymore.

2648
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:01,720
This guy...

2649
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,520
Back in my day.

2650
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:06,660
Oh, cause he's an author.

2651
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:09,020
Cause he's an author.

2652
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:09,640
He's all...

2653
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:10,620
He's all like...

2654
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:13,200
It's gotta be perfect, you know?

2655
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:15,500
Okay.

2656
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:17,100
They...

2657
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:18,440
They really think I've done it.

2658
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,280
Detective, you have to help me.

2659
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:21,900
You...

2660
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:23,220
You know it wasn't me, right?

2661
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:24,740
What's bag mean?

2662
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:29,700
Did you not think it was strange that your bag was full of salami?

2663
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:30,760
Uh...

2664
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:31,840
I don't know.

2665
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:33,860
I thought someone gave me a salami surprise.

2666
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:35,200
That's...

2667
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:35,460
You know what?

2668
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:36,340
That's a typical...

2669
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:36,580
You know.

2670
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:40,340
Pass his life and boob his hometown.

2671
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:41,300
Don't change, man.

2672
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:44,740
Thanks for the super chat, Len.

2673
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:49,460
I'll eat salami sandwiches for breakfast, lunch and dinner from now on.

2674
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:51,760
That's not the point.

2675
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:52,440
Okay.

2676
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:53,680
Doofus.

2677
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:57,380
I wanna get into the server room.

2678
01:55:58,200 --> 01:55:58,640
Wait.

2679
01:55:58,700 --> 01:55:59,720
Maybe we can get in now.

2680
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:01,120
Cause no one's here.

2681
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:02,860
It says it's locked.

2682
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:03,320
Dang.

2683
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:04,820
Let's go.

2684
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:06,200
She likes the cats though.

2685
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,920
So I'm guessing that one's from...

2686
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:08,860
And you know...

2687
01:56:09,620 --> 01:56:10,060
Uh...

2688
01:56:10,060 --> 01:56:12,040
Laura is a cat.

2689
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:13,100
So...

2690
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:15,260
I'm guessing that one's from her.

2691
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:17,820
And then Boris.

2692
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:18,840
And then...

2693
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:21,640
But who did it get stolen?

2694
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:22,600
Who's got stolen?

2695
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:24,520
Unless...

2696
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:25,420
It's all...

2697
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:28,020
Freddy's got stolen.

2698
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:29,140
Probably.

2699
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:30,340
Cause they're framing him, right?

2700
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:32,380
Do you know anything about this letter?

2701
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:35,340
Well, it's obviously a cheap prank by Fredderson.

2702
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:37,620
Hopefully he would find this funny.

2703
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:45,040
I'm guessing you're ready to present legal evidence of Fredderson's misconducts.

2704
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:46,620
It wasn't Fredderson.

2705
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,360
Everything is pointing towards him.

2706
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,440
I will present the true culprit soon enough.

2707
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:53,200
Soon enough.

2708
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:55,260
Well, I don't really care how long it takes.

2709
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:58,960
This will be Fredderson's last day.

2710
01:56:59,120 --> 01:56:59,240
Oh!

2711
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:00,320
What?

2712
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:01,540
Everybody...

2713
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:03,060
Everybody wants him fired!

2714
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:07,000
Ducks are 70% more likely.

2715
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:07,560
Also, yeah.

2716
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:08,540
Someone said that her...

2717
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:10,320
That Laura's computer is free.

2718
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:11,420
What's this one, though?

2719
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:14,560
This folder says, manual for CS agents.

2720
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:18,900
How and when to create vouchers correctly?

2721
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,940
I'm falling asleep just reading the title.

2722
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:23,320
I think it's great reading.

2723
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:23,820
All right.

2724
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:24,100
Let's see.

2725
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:24,680
What do we got here?

2726
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:25,240
Oh!

2727
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:25,900
Sophie.

2728
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:28,200
Chat friends.

2729
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:29,020
Okay.

2730
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:29,880
What are they talking about?

2731
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:38,440
But... something... returned.

2732
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:40,120
But they're sexy now.

2733
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:40,760
Bye now.

2734
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:42,320
The aliens have returned!

2735
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:43,480
But they're sexy now.

2736
01:57:44,540 --> 01:57:45,080
OMG.

2737
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:45,380
Lol.

2738
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:46,340
Is he serious?

2739
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:48,400
What a dumb pen name.

2740
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:48,740
Hahaha.

2741
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:50,260
It's just his name backwards.

2742
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:56,680
Complaints.

2743
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:59,280
Can the OO please clean their desk?

2744
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:00,500
I can smell it.

2745
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:02,060
Until here.

2746
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:05,500
She's a complainer.

2747
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:05,980
Jeebus.

2748
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:07,000
Crossed book on the map.

2749
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:07,160
Bishop.

2750
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:07,740
Thank you!

2751
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,420
So she's a complainer, eh?

2752
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:13,540
You definitely don't want to be Laura's enemy.

2753
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:15,780
Okay.

2754
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:16,920
So...

2755
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:18,640
Laura gave the plushie.

2756
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:21,500
Rufus gave the book.

2757
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:22,880
And maybe...

2758
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:23,200
Oh.

2759
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:23,800
Uh...

2760
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:25,940
Something got stolen.

2761
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:28,680
Books?

2762
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:29,620
Letters?

2763
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:30,760
Necklaces?

2764
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,080
Plushies?

2765
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:35,620
Nothing got stolen.

2766
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:36,460
Everybody...

2767
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:37,120
So...

2768
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:39,540
Nothing got stolen after all.

2769
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:40,100
Okay.

2770
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:43,120
It seemed that the salami present was intentional.

2771
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:43,900
Hmm.

2772
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:47,820
Very interesting indeed.

2773
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:50,340
It's a conspiracy.

2774
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:55,140
Yeah, they say salami banned it, but people's stuff was there.

2775
01:58:55,940 --> 01:58:56,660
Hmm.

2776
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:57,000
Hmm.

2777
01:58:57,120 --> 01:58:57,620
Hmm.

2778
01:58:58,540 --> 01:58:59,260
Hmm.

2779
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:01,500
When can I get...

2780
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:03,140
Sexy alien...

2781
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:03,540
Alien...

2782
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:04,760
Sexy aliens want my number two.

2783
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:07,860
When can I get that?

2784
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:15,200
Okay.

2785
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:15,620
I'll...

2786
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:16,540
I'll comfort her.

2787
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:17,520
It'll be okay.

2788
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:21,640
You have the duck detective here to figure everything out.

2789
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,580
What can you possibly do?

2790
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:27,660
I'm a detective.

2791
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:29,580
Leave me alone.

2792
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:30,740
Okay.

2793
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:31,840
Sorry, ma'am.

2794
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:33,520
Um...

2795
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:33,960
I'm sorry.

2796
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:37,340
Is there something in here that we're...

2797
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:37,900
Oh.

2798
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:39,420
The message.

2799
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:41,300
Receive the blank.

2800
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:44,580
Oh wait!

2801
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:45,500
We have to talk to Boris.

2802
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:46,360
I don't know where he is.

2803
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:46,880
Oh my goodness.

2804
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:49,400
Completely forgot about him.

2805
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:52,980
And...

2806
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:53,380
Oh yeah.

2807
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:54,800
There's also Margaret's PC.

2808
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:56,640
So...

2809
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:57,080
Now...

2810
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:58,180
Blue...

2811
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:00,540
Skinned alien.

2812
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:02,800
Me and sexy alien.

2813
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:03,720
Blue skinned alien?

2814
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:03,940
Oh no...

2815
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:05,740
Purple.

2816
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,720
Red-eyed alien.

2817
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:13,020
Shiny.

2818
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,000
Armored.

2819
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:15,860
Wait, wait!

2820
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,820
Purple-eyed alien.

2821
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:20,760
Nice!

2822
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,440
She's the main alien!

2823
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:27,120
Let's see what secrets she has on her computer.

2824
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:28,100
Ha ha ha!

2825
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:29,100
Secrets!

2826
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:30,340
Let's see.

2827
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:32,300
West VPN?

2828
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:34,280
Secret cake recipes?

2829
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:37,400
Never gonna give you up dot wave?

2830
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:43,520
Bus fare internal vouchers for CS agents.

2831
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:45,700
Three hour delay compensation.

2832
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:47,500
Booked on next bus.

2833
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:49,160
A vacation, eh?

2834
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:50,980
Planned trip.

2835
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:51,680
Interesting.

2836
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:54,060
Delete everything!

2837
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:55,060
What?

2838
02:00:59,420 --> 02:00:59,820
Cutie!

2839
02:01:10,100 --> 02:01:10,900
Illegal activity?

2840
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:19,130
But the alien... it has to be Rufus.

2841
02:01:19,770 --> 02:01:21,490
This makes me never want to work in an office.

2842
02:01:21,570 --> 02:01:23,030
This is exactly what it's like, even.

2843
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:24,950
Who is this person she's messaging?

2844
02:01:25,710 --> 02:01:27,330
Oh, I think I have a clone.

2845
02:01:30,510 --> 02:01:32,230
Oh wait, we've already talked about it.

2846
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:34,030
Okay, let's go see what Boris thinks.

2847
02:01:34,170 --> 02:01:34,950
We haven't talked to him.

2848
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:41,060
Oh, what's this now?

2849
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:48,000
Customs procedures for passengers entering from the west border.

2850
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:50,280
Import.

2851
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:53,200
Allowed goods.

2852
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:56,800
Personal items worth less than 500 shmark.

2853
02:01:57,600 --> 02:01:59,840
Notify the local police about suspicious activity.

2854
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:01,340
Prohibited goods.

2855
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:03,800
Oh, there better not be salami on this list.

2856
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:05,100
Weapons.

2857
02:02:05,100 --> 02:02:06,280
Gun.

2858
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:06,800
Scary.

2859
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:12,080
Over 10 trombones.

2860
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:14,520
Meat!

2861
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:17,920
Potatoes.

2862
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:21,680
Books not in the interests of the eastern states.

2863
02:02:22,780 --> 02:02:23,160
Plants.

2864
02:02:23,180 --> 02:02:25,380
Luggage will be checked at the bus station.

2865
02:02:25,740 --> 02:02:29,080
For more information, visit this place's customs.

2866
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:35,440
But also, books not in the interests of the...

2867
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:36,820
Uh-oh.

2868
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:40,200
If they're going on a trip...

2869
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:43,540
He can't... he has his books...

2870
02:02:43,540 --> 02:02:44,500
What do they have against potatoes?

2871
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:48,400
Potato famine is not a joke.

2872
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:53,740
Maybe it was too romantic.

2873
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:56,100
Did Sophie ask about me?

2874
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:57,400
Uh...

2875
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,120
What do you think, guys?

2876
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:02,180
Should we give this guy some follow-ups?

2877
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:02,960
Should we give this guy some false hope or...

2878
02:03:03,660 --> 02:03:07,160
Should we... should we give this guy some false hope or...

2879
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:08,680
Do you think, uh...

2880
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:10,100
No?

2881
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:17,820
Nah, he's rude.

2882
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:18,280
True.

2883
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:21,800
It did say it looked cheap.

2884
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:23,220
It did say that.

2885
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:26,320
Okay, so yeah, we definitely knew that.

2886
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:27,600
Let's see.

2887
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:29,380
So...

2888
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:31,720
Let's...

2889
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:33,520
I'm just gonna put Sophie received a...

2890
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:36,500
Romantic...

2891
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:39,740
Book that contained...

2892
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,360
A...

2893
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:45,260
Scary...

2894
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:46,360
Message.

2895
02:03:53,620 --> 02:03:54,080
Or...

2896
02:03:57,680 --> 02:04:00,820
Margaret received a ro... a...

2897
02:04:00,820 --> 02:04:02,460
A message.

2898
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:09,920
A contained...

2899
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:11,900
I don't know.

2900
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:12,660
Actually...

2901
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:13,700
Well, I was gonna say message.

2902
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:17,000
Like, cause they were messaging online, but...

2903
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:22,960
The book is contained a scary message, you guys.

2904
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:24,780
Scary aliens.

2905
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:27,800
It contained a scary salami.

2906
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:33,840
The message.

2907
02:04:34,740 --> 02:04:35,860
So my...

2908
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:36,220
Uh...

2909
02:04:36,620 --> 02:04:37,020
Sophie...

2910
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:39,460
Received a...

2911
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:41,880
Nice...

2912
02:04:45,150 --> 02:04:45,950
Well...

2913
02:04:48,570 --> 02:04:50,170
A nice salami.

2914
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:53,390
That contained a scary salami.

2915
02:04:53,630 --> 02:04:54,430
Oh no!

2916
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:02,560
It wasn't a nice salami after all.

2917
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,760
It was a scary salami.

2918
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:06,200
Wait, hold on.

2919
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:08,380
Let's go back inside.

2920
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:09,580
I don't wanna be...

2921
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:10,240
You know...

2922
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:12,560
Doing my work in the rain after all.

2923
02:05:13,900 --> 02:05:15,040
Let's go in here.

2924
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:22,840
So would it be this?

2925
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:26,760
B.E.

2926
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:29,940
I don't think anybody's initials are that, are they?

2927
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:33,620
Boris?

2928
02:05:33,620 --> 02:05:33,860
Boris?

2929
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:36,480
It's a B.

2930
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:45,460
It's salamis all the way down.

2931
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:48,420
Salami, salami, salami.

2932
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:52,020
So what is the message?

2933
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:52,640
Is it...

2934
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:53,760
Is it this message?

2935
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:55,660
Or is it...

2936
02:05:55,660 --> 02:05:57,080
I think it's a...

2937
02:05:57,500 --> 02:05:58,640
Oh no, here we go again.

2938
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:01,100
It's this message though, right?

2939
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:02,560
That's what I'm assuming.

2940
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:10,600
So, Margaret received a...

2941
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:13,700
So it's the message in the box, not the message she received on the computer?

2942
02:06:21,160 --> 02:06:23,820
In the box.

2943
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:25,020
Oh, okay.

2944
02:06:29,060 --> 02:06:31,320
Sophie received a nice salami.

2945
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:35,920
A scary message.

2946
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:38,240
That contained...

2947
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:40,860
A nice salami.

2948
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:45,140
Take a closer look at the note.

2949
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:45,540
Okay.

2950
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:48,260
Well, it said like...

2951
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:48,900
It was like a...

2952
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:49,900
It was like...

2953
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:51,180
A cocky message.

2954
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:52,040
It was like...

2955
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:55,740
It was like a...

2956
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:58,320
Yeah, a cocky attitude.

2957
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,480
A weird message.

2958
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:04,620
Quite unbelievable.

2959
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,820
I entered the office really easily.

2960
02:07:07,180 --> 02:07:09,220
But also, why is this whole part blank?

2961
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:11,260
Why did they write it like that?

2962
02:07:14,180 --> 02:07:15,480
A cocky salami.

2963
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,520
This is the content I come here for.

2964
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:18,380
Also, rip your throat.

2965
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:23,020
Oh, wait.

2966
02:07:23,580 --> 02:07:26,160
I just wanted to say that your laugh is extremely charming.

2967
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:27,820
I feel happy while listening to your laugh.

2968
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:28,340
Thank you.

2969
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:31,200
Your brain cell...

2970
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:31,580
Oh my god.

2971
02:07:31,580 --> 02:07:32,680
They're kind of behind.

2972
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:33,500
Oh my goodness, sorry.

2973
02:07:34,460 --> 02:07:36,800
The brain cell you took with you after leaving heaven...

2974
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:37,920
Really put in the work...

2975
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:39,420
Okay.

2976
02:07:41,640 --> 02:07:43,120
So she received...

2977
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:44,900
None of these are strange.

2978
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:46,520
A silly message.

2979
02:07:47,820 --> 02:07:49,560
It's not a romantic message.

2980
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:50,520
She received a...

2981
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:55,240
A silly salami.

2982
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:57,100
Letter.

2983
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,700
A scary letter.

2984
02:07:59,000 --> 02:07:59,780
Not scary.

2985
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:01,480
It's not a nice letter though.

2986
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:03,260
It's not a silly letter either.

2987
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:04,400
Scary letter.

2988
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:06,460
That contained...

2989
02:08:06,460 --> 02:08:08,340
I'm so confused by these letters.

2990
02:08:08,340 --> 02:08:09,080
These adjectives.

2991
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,840
A romantic salami...

2992
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:15,460
I think romantic salami sounds really correct.

2993
02:08:21,930 --> 02:08:22,630
Thank you.

2994
02:08:23,870 --> 02:08:25,710
My voice hasn't really recovered.

2995
02:08:25,850 --> 02:08:28,190
Also, a mental breakdown and girly screeches.

2996
02:08:31,010 --> 02:08:32,190
Maybe in reverse.

2997
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:35,550
Contained a...

2998
02:08:36,090 --> 02:08:37,590
nice salami.

2999
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:44,460
Hmm.

3000
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:46,960
A silly salami?

3001
02:08:54,970 --> 02:08:56,710
Oh, maybe silly letter?

3002
02:08:58,450 --> 02:08:59,570
Scary salami?

3003
02:09:01,930 --> 02:09:03,710
I think B.E.

3004
02:09:03,730 --> 02:09:04,770
is Bema Emmerich.

3005
02:09:05,130 --> 02:09:07,130
What's wrong with B.E.?

3006
02:09:12,650 --> 02:09:14,450
Is there a present in here?

3007
02:09:15,490 --> 02:09:17,370
No, there's no present.

3008
02:09:18,870 --> 02:09:22,030
There's nothing in here that says she received a present, you know?

3009
02:09:25,940 --> 02:09:29,440
She received salami that contained a letter.

3010
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:32,040
I guess?

3011
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:38,440
What else is in here?

3012
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:40,400
Wait, wait, wait!

3013
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:43,120
A silly letter that contained a scary...

3014
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:44,360
Message!

3015
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:47,860
Why is it a silly letter though?

3016
02:09:49,140 --> 02:09:50,560
Why is it a silly letter?

3017
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:53,040
OK.

3018
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:56,580
It was a letter that contained a message.

3019
02:09:56,720 --> 02:09:57,580
Got it, got it, got it.

3020
02:09:58,160 --> 02:09:59,860
Oh no, there's more.

3021
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:05,060
Blank are being blanked, blanked from blank.

3022
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:15,400
Books are being illegally imported from...

3023
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:19,500
Wait.

3024
02:10:27,670 --> 02:10:29,010
Where was the...

3025
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:31,730
Oh no, not this one.

3026
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:32,930
The vacation?

3027
02:10:37,140 --> 02:10:37,660
Brazil?

3028
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:40,320
I don't think there was a Brazil.

3029
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:43,600
Brazil!

3030
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:45,740
Bretzel.

3031
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:47,300
It's from Bretzel.

3032
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:55,340
Unless it's not books, unless it's...

3033
02:10:56,180 --> 02:10:56,700
Salamis.

3034
02:11:04,710 --> 02:11:07,230
That explains all the high-grade salami.

3035
02:11:07,750 --> 02:11:09,050
Yeah, because it was on the letter.

3036
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:10,810
Or on the receipt, right?

3037
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:12,870
We just needed to find out who was behind this.

3038
02:11:13,230 --> 02:11:18,010
The mystery of the salami bandits was slowly getting unraveled.

3039
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:18,710
It was on the receipt.

3040
02:11:19,730 --> 02:11:24,390
Western goods are prohibited from entering and being sold in the East.

3041
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:25,050
Yeah.

3042
02:11:26,730 --> 02:11:30,430
This is why the salami bandits decided to make a business.

3043
02:11:31,230 --> 02:11:34,650
Out of buying high-grade salami in the West.

3044
02:11:34,650 --> 02:11:38,590
And smuggling it to the East.

3045
02:11:39,230 --> 02:11:41,290
And that's why you didn't want him to take his bag.

3046
02:11:41,730 --> 02:11:43,890
And selling it at a high profit.

3047
02:11:44,110 --> 02:11:46,890
And then they're gonna go on vacation with the money.

3048
02:11:47,150 --> 02:11:52,450
Also, for some reason, Sophie received a letter from the salami bandits.

3049
02:11:52,570 --> 02:11:53,870
Because they were making fun of his book.

3050
02:11:53,930 --> 02:11:56,390
And had a hidden, threatening message.

3051
02:11:58,870 --> 02:11:59,350
Wait.

3052
02:11:59,470 --> 02:12:00,870
Why are all the letters there?

3053
02:12:00,950 --> 02:12:01,570
They look different.

3054
02:12:01,950 --> 02:12:03,150
This was serious.

3055
02:12:03,150 --> 02:12:05,910
I had to question all of the employees.

3056
02:12:06,210 --> 02:12:06,870
All of them.

3057
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:09,950
They were making fun of his book and so they're upset.

3058
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:12,410
Thanks for coming, everyone.

3059
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:16,670
Well, everyone except for Sophie.

3060
02:12:17,510 --> 02:12:18,590
Where is she?

3061
02:12:20,090 --> 02:12:20,950
Slacking off.

3062
02:12:21,130 --> 02:12:23,410
Playing on her computer phone.

3063
02:12:23,670 --> 02:12:24,850
Computer phone.

3064
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:27,350
She's having problems with her family.

3065
02:12:27,890 --> 02:12:31,730
She was at her desk and said she needed a moment.

3066
02:12:32,030 --> 02:12:32,190
No.

3067
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:35,870
Romani.

3068
02:12:35,970 --> 02:12:36,130
Romani.

3069
02:12:36,130 --> 02:12:36,730
Welcome to membership.

3070
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:37,310
Thank you.

3071
02:12:38,350 --> 02:12:39,970
I will start then regardless.

3072
02:12:40,930 --> 02:12:42,970
I have made my deductions.

3073
02:12:43,110 --> 02:12:43,430
Yes.

3074
02:12:43,650 --> 02:12:45,470
And drawn some serious conclusions.

3075
02:12:45,870 --> 02:12:46,790
Serious conclusions.

3076
02:12:47,710 --> 02:12:48,190
Finally.

3077
02:12:48,610 --> 02:12:50,410
Is Freddy getting fired then?

3078
02:12:50,650 --> 02:12:51,110
Oh gosh.

3079
02:12:51,190 --> 02:12:52,690
Freddy's not getting fired, you guys.

3080
02:12:52,710 --> 02:12:53,370
This is pretty bad.

3081
02:12:53,890 --> 02:12:55,150
Laura's gonna be so mad at me.

3082
02:12:55,390 --> 02:12:56,050
Who is the murderer?

3083
02:12:57,630 --> 02:12:58,110
I...

3084
02:12:58,110 --> 02:12:58,990
What?

3085
02:12:59,830 --> 02:13:00,890
No one died.

3086
02:13:01,670 --> 02:13:09,170
I went to check out hives for the first time since breeding them since the washboards and the roads out there were bad enough to where they rattled my windshield.

3087
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:10,490
Wait.

3088
02:13:10,530 --> 02:13:10,990
Are you okay?

3089
02:13:11,690 --> 02:13:12,750
Just wanted to let...

3090
02:13:12,750 --> 02:13:13,610
All are fine.

3091
02:13:13,890 --> 02:13:14,030
Oh.

3092
02:13:14,210 --> 02:13:15,110
Glad they're okay.

3093
02:13:15,210 --> 02:13:16,110
I'm getting frayed.

3094
02:13:16,210 --> 02:13:17,030
I'm telling you.

3095
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:17,650
You are.

3096
02:13:17,790 --> 02:13:19,730
But not by Laura who I originally thought.

3097
02:13:20,010 --> 02:13:21,690
Want a load of bologna?

3098
02:13:21,750 --> 02:13:22,450
No, actually.

3099
02:13:23,410 --> 02:13:23,890
Salami.

3100
02:13:24,110 --> 02:13:27,130
He is right, actually.

3101
02:13:27,730 --> 02:13:29,150
He is getting frayed.

3102
02:13:31,290 --> 02:13:33,470
Laura is also the shift Yanike.

3103
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:34,250
No way.

3104
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:35,330
Why anyone bother?

3105
02:13:36,990 --> 02:13:39,590
That is the question, isn't it?

3106
02:13:39,730 --> 02:13:41,910
Why would anyone bother?

3107
02:13:42,250 --> 02:13:43,650
Get to the point.

3108
02:13:44,030 --> 02:13:47,290
It's through my observations that I uncovered.

3109
02:13:47,570 --> 02:13:48,570
I uncovered...

3110
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:49,130
A conspiracy.

3111
02:13:49,670 --> 02:13:50,010
Yeah.

3112
02:13:50,590 --> 02:13:51,730
I mean yes.

3113
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:53,250
I did uncover that.

3114
02:13:53,490 --> 02:13:53,930
Oh.

3115
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:55,330
Oh, gasp.

3116
02:13:57,670 --> 02:14:01,670
I told Otacon I don't believe in the supernatural, but now I do.

3117
02:14:03,390 --> 02:14:04,910
Love the voice acting in this.

3118
02:14:04,970 --> 02:14:05,670
It's so good.

3119
02:14:09,490 --> 02:14:11,190
Oh, no, no, sir.

3120
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:12,590
Stop right there.

3121
02:14:13,270 --> 02:14:14,370
Oh, or...

3122
02:14:14,370 --> 02:14:17,510
I'm a certified private investigator and...

3123
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:18,230
It's okay.

3124
02:14:18,330 --> 02:14:19,650
Just tell us what you know.

3125
02:14:22,130 --> 02:14:25,710
Maybe the salami we made was the friends along the way or something.

3126
02:14:26,910 --> 02:14:33,410
Salami is being smuggled from South Sitia using your very own buses.

3127
02:14:35,370 --> 02:14:36,550
What's going on?

3128
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:38,710
Okay, this is going too far.

3129
02:14:38,950 --> 02:14:41,770
I really have more important things to do.

3130
02:14:43,030 --> 02:14:43,790
Everyone's leaving!

3131
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:47,890
Now that is really scandalous.

3132
02:14:48,770 --> 02:14:51,070
Does that mean we're losing our jobs?

3133
02:14:52,490 --> 02:14:53,690
Uh... maybe.

3134
02:14:54,010 --> 02:14:58,150
Why is everybody leaving?

3135
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:00,810
Listen, everybody.

3136
02:15:01,430 --> 02:15:04,690
It's really important that no one leaves the premises.

3137
02:15:06,090 --> 02:15:08,210
I need to get back to work.

3138
02:15:08,290 --> 02:15:08,870
Wait a second!

3139
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:14,720
Everybody's leaving?

3140
02:15:19,700 --> 02:15:20,420
Oh...

3141
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:25,880
I'm still here, Mr. Duck Detective.

3142
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:29,320
Nobody cares!

3143
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:30,760
Yeah...

3144
02:15:32,260 --> 02:15:33,020
Um...

3145
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:36,580
I guess we'll just continue our illegal activities.

3146
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Wait, whose phone is this?

3147
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:40,180
Oh?

3148
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:44,060
K.T.

3149
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:45,360
Senjoyer.

3150
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:47,140
Oh, K.T.S.

3151
02:15:50,820 --> 02:15:53,080
K.T.S.

3152
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:53,940
K.T.S.

3153
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:54,840
Enjoyer!

3154
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:08,640
Almost dead.

3155
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:11,600
Are your parents still angry at you?

3156
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:17,260
Min-tenjoyer.

3157
02:16:17,900 --> 02:16:19,340
Min-tenjoyer.

3158
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:20,620
Min-tenjoyer.

3159
02:16:20,620 --> 02:16:20,660
Wow.

3160
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:25,420
This is nonsensical.

3161
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:30,580
Did she get kidnapped?

3162
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:32,540
This is curious.

3163
02:16:32,980 --> 02:16:34,220
I think she got kidnapped, you guys.

3164
02:16:34,320 --> 02:16:36,040
Why would she write like this?

3165
02:16:36,740 --> 02:16:37,540
Uh oh.

3166
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:41,240
Someone forgot their phone.

3167
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:43,580
Oh, the music changed and everything.

3168
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:44,640
It's kinda fun.

3169
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:48,240
This is getting intense, isn't it?

3170
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:52,100
I don't think so.

3171
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:56,820
Lonely added the clues!

3172
02:16:57,120 --> 02:16:58,640
This game is targeting me!

3173
02:16:58,640 --> 02:16:59,360
What do you want me to do?

3174
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:01,740
Decide for messages?

3175
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:03,920
Talk someone into telling us the truth?

3176
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:05,620
Follow people around?

3177
02:17:06,200 --> 02:17:07,500
I'm pretty good at that.

3178
02:17:07,880 --> 02:17:09,460
Just stay here.

3179
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:10,020
Yeah.

3180
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:10,680
Like this?

3181
02:17:10,860 --> 02:17:11,360
Yeah.

3182
02:17:11,660 --> 02:17:12,980
You're doing great.

3183
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:16,320
Okay.

3184
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:19,260
Everybody went back to work.

3185
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:20,980
Which is really great.

3186
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:22,960
Sophie's probably kidnapped.

3187
02:17:23,420 --> 02:17:23,640
Oh.

3188
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:26,540
They seem a bit worried.

3189
02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:30,400
Oh my god, there's a mess of a scene here.

3190
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:32,360
I think she really was kidnapped.

3191
02:17:34,340 --> 02:17:35,140
Or it was me.

3192
02:17:37,340 --> 02:17:37,960
Uh-oh.

3193
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:39,260
This is...

3194
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:39,420
Oh!

3195
02:17:39,560 --> 02:17:40,860
The cat is on the ground!

3196
02:17:42,100 --> 02:17:42,540
Um...

3197
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:43,640
Sophie left!

3198
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:46,020
And she left a note on the desk.

3199
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:48,240
Oh, she did now.

3200
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:49,960
Did she?

3201
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:51,120
What's this?

3202
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:56,640
Let's... the last dialed number on this phone is 03-05...

3203
02:17:56,640 --> 02:17:57,180
Missed some streams.

3204
02:17:57,380 --> 02:17:58,620
How did this become a...

3205
02:17:59,460 --> 02:18:00,100
1777.

3206
02:18:01,580 --> 02:18:02,520
Oh my gosh!

3207
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:03,860
They just doxxed my phone number!

3208
02:18:04,820 --> 02:18:05,460
What's this?

3209
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:06,880
Unknown number.

3210
02:18:07,580 --> 02:18:08,220
Anymore.

3211
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:09,200
I'll tell them everything.

3212
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:10,480
Don't.

3213
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:12,720
Fight.

3214
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:15,040
You blocked this number.

3215
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:16,240
Click here to unblock.

3216
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:18,520
Interesting.

3217
02:18:20,640 --> 02:18:24,960
Am I the asshole for expecting my coworkers to remember my birthday?

3218
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:28,300
It's my 20F birthday.

3219
02:18:28,340 --> 02:18:28,620
I'm so happy.

3220
02:18:28,620 --> 02:18:29,220
Today.

3221
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:30,800
And no one congratulated me.

3222
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:35,360
I don't need much, but at least a handwritten card would have been nice.

3223
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:42,280
I can't believe she complained about this online.

3224
02:18:42,740 --> 02:18:43,180
She's a...

3225
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:44,780
She went to Reddit for it.

3226
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:45,880
It's crazy.

3227
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:48,780
Wait, where's the note?

3228
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:49,340
Oh, here it is.

3229
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:52,220
That's it.

3230
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:53,320
I quit.

3231
02:18:54,840 --> 02:18:55,620
Sudden news.

3232
02:18:57,340 --> 02:18:59,620
You'll never see me again.

3233
02:18:59,900 --> 02:19:00,640
Wait a second.

3234
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:04,920
Sophie Windthimer.

3235
02:19:05,360 --> 02:19:06,260
This is not her.

3236
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:08,820
This is the bandit's handwriting.

3237
02:19:12,300 --> 02:19:13,740
This is the bandit's handwriting.

3238
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:16,480
Sophie.

3239
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:17,640
Let her off.

3240
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:19,260
Uh-oh.

3241
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:22,320
What a dramatic turn.

3242
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:24,600
I should keep this as evidence.

3243
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:26,000
Better late.

3244
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:29,180
Get.

3245
02:19:31,540 --> 02:19:32,620
She left?

3246
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:34,500
Just like this?

3247
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:35,480
Just like this.

3248
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:37,540
Maybe she's at home.

3249
02:19:38,180 --> 02:19:39,540
Should I look for her?

3250
02:19:43,050 --> 02:19:44,910
Did you read Sophie's letter?

3251
02:19:45,890 --> 02:19:46,630
I did.

3252
02:19:48,070 --> 02:19:48,890
Something's off.

3253
02:19:49,110 --> 02:19:49,630
Uh-huh.

3254
02:19:49,890 --> 02:19:51,390
Something's different.

3255
02:19:51,650 --> 02:19:52,170
The handwriting.

3256
02:19:52,690 --> 02:19:54,290
The handwriting is different.

3257
02:19:56,510 --> 02:19:58,390
This is the note Sophie left.

3258
02:19:58,670 --> 02:19:59,810
Can you tell me more about it?

3259
02:19:59,810 --> 02:20:01,790
And you know who was the first person to leave?

3260
02:20:01,830 --> 02:20:01,990
Sophie.

3261
02:20:01,990 --> 02:20:02,910
The penguin.

3262
02:20:03,270 --> 02:20:04,990
He had all the time.

3263
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:06,930
He was the first person to leave the room.

3264
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:08,190
It's totally him.

3265
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:11,010
It doesn't make sense at all that she'd just suddenly leave.

3266
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:13,970
She definitely needs the money.

3267
02:20:14,190 --> 02:20:15,610
And she would have told me.

3268
02:20:15,930 --> 02:20:16,950
I'm her friend.

3269
02:20:17,330 --> 02:20:18,150
Uh-huh.

3270
02:20:22,470 --> 02:20:23,610
No, the bear was...

3271
02:20:23,610 --> 02:20:24,990
No, it was definitely the penguin.

3272
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:34,580
Would you ever do a stream where you just read Am I the Asshole post while playing Minecraft?

3273
02:20:35,480 --> 02:20:35,800
Sure.

3274
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:38,460
Oh, we can also check out his computer.

3275
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:41,840
Hey, Eugene McQuacklin.

3276
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:45,920
Throw bread to the fine beak of lady justice.

3277
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:47,600
That's me.

3278
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:50,340
Stalking.

3279
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:52,800
Looking for a job.

3280
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:53,900
We'll do almost anything.

3281
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:55,400
Buy my book.

3282
02:20:56,500 --> 02:20:58,300
Murder at the beaver's dam.

3283
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:00,160
When the dam broke, beaver...

3284
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:02,520
Bikel lost his mind.

3285
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:03,720
Oh my god.

3286
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:05,700
Crime and thrillers.

3287
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:11,960
Kidnapping and a kingpin.

3288
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:14,040
Never kidnap a king penguin.

3289
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:15,560
Kingpin on his birthday.

3290
02:21:19,150 --> 02:21:20,950
Murder, kidnapping, stalking.

3291
02:21:21,010 --> 02:21:22,630
This guy is such a criminal.

3292
02:21:23,190 --> 02:21:25,850
Someone is clearly obsessed with detectives.

3293
02:21:25,930 --> 02:21:27,250
You can't have a hobby anymore?

3294
02:21:27,490 --> 02:21:28,750
Okay, it's just obsession.

3295
02:21:28,870 --> 02:21:29,230
Sure.

3296
02:21:35,810 --> 02:21:37,670
What do you think of this note?

3297
02:21:38,310 --> 02:21:40,770
It's no surprise she's left, is it?

3298
02:21:41,490 --> 02:21:44,550
Would you want to work with someone you've dated in the past?

3299
02:21:45,150 --> 02:21:45,510
Whoa.

3300
02:21:48,210 --> 02:21:50,510
Who would hire me at this age?

3301
02:21:50,830 --> 02:21:51,770
No, it's in demand.

3302
02:21:52,330 --> 02:21:55,630
Oh, maybe I can be a real estate agent.

3303
02:21:55,830 --> 02:21:56,550
Oh my god, so true.

3304
02:21:56,990 --> 02:21:59,250
I always wanted to be a rich real estate agent.

3305
02:21:59,490 --> 02:22:00,950
Live your dreams, Margaret.

3306
02:22:03,990 --> 02:22:06,950
What about you, sussy McSussPants?

3307
02:22:07,690 --> 02:22:09,110
Oh, I can't ask you about anything.

3308
02:22:09,130 --> 02:22:11,930
Why would Laura recruit you to deal with the theft?

3309
02:22:12,650 --> 02:22:16,110
Aren't there any other detectives who are actually qualified for the job?

3310
02:22:16,310 --> 02:22:16,650
Wow.

3311
02:22:16,890 --> 02:22:19,410
I've been doing very well so far.

3312
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:20,930
If I do say so myself.

3313
02:22:22,190 --> 02:22:25,030
The truth will be revealed in the end.

3314
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:26,430
There's only one truth.

3315
02:22:28,490 --> 02:22:30,570
Suss, suss, suss, suss.

3316
02:22:31,390 --> 02:22:33,070
Suss, suss, suss, suss.

3317
02:22:34,310 --> 02:22:35,650
We'll also be able to go back out.

3318
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:36,730
Wait, where did he go?

3319
02:22:39,770 --> 02:22:42,050
Uh, I'm just gonna open this.

3320
02:22:46,430 --> 02:22:47,490
Move the painting here.

3321
02:22:50,230 --> 02:22:50,870
Yeah.

3322
02:22:52,430 --> 02:22:53,130
A safe.

3323
02:22:58,200 --> 02:22:58,840
CS00BD.

3324
02:23:02,680 --> 02:23:04,560
Customer support is two.

3325
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:07,800
Zero, zero.

3326
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:15,620
Uh, zero?

3327
02:23:16,400 --> 02:23:17,380
And birthday.

3328
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:20,600
Do we know his birthday?

3329
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:24,100
Oh, operating office, so one.

3330
02:23:30,890 --> 02:23:31,990
Bus driver!

3331
02:23:32,690 --> 02:23:33,150
Oh.

3332
02:23:34,370 --> 02:23:34,970
Nope.

3333
02:23:35,410 --> 02:23:36,230
Wait, no!

3334
02:23:36,310 --> 02:23:37,110
We have...

3335
02:23:37,550 --> 02:23:39,050
Wait, uh, we have four bus drivers.

3336
02:23:39,290 --> 02:23:39,690
Yes!

3337
02:23:43,740 --> 02:23:45,220
I did it!

3338
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:46,020
I did it!

3339
02:23:46,060 --> 02:23:46,580
My god!

3340
02:23:46,820 --> 02:23:47,280
Oh.

3341
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:47,360
Oh.

3342
02:23:47,560 --> 02:23:51,000
I always wanted to open a ridiculously big safe.

3343
02:23:51,620 --> 02:23:53,900
Let's see what secrets he has in here.

3344
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:54,540
Secrets.

3345
02:23:55,660 --> 02:23:57,040
Okay, we got some keys.

3346
02:23:58,040 --> 02:23:58,600
Keychain.

3347
02:23:58,780 --> 02:23:59,160
Server.

3348
02:24:00,040 --> 02:24:00,860
Server rope key.

3349
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:02,960
Dear Ingrid.

3350
02:24:03,400 --> 02:24:04,680
Wait, this is his handwriting.

3351
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:08,100
I haven't been there for you and the kids recently.

3352
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:10,080
But things are looking up.

3353
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:15,340
I would love to take you to a romantic getaway to Hollandaise.

3354
02:24:15,660 --> 02:24:16,940
Love, Manfred.

3355
02:24:16,940 --> 02:24:18,640
The handwriting!

3356
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:22,080
Different handwriting.

3357
02:24:24,580 --> 02:24:25,340
Demands?

3358
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:28,640
Me, employee of the month?

3359
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:30,220
TV in my room?

3360
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:32,520
Keep quiet about the thing.

3361
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:35,920
Do all these things and nothing will happen to you.

3362
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:38,300
He's being blackmailed!

3363
02:24:44,270 --> 02:24:45,030
Oh.

3364
02:24:45,970 --> 02:24:47,170
He's being...

3365
02:24:47,170 --> 02:24:48,230
Wait, so he...

3366
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:53,210
Is probably being put up to doing the bandit stuff by the penguin, maybe.

3367
02:24:53,810 --> 02:24:57,510
Awful lot of security for a branch manager of a bus company.

3368
02:24:57,830 --> 02:24:58,390
Uh-huh.

3369
02:24:58,830 --> 02:24:59,110
Wait.

3370
02:24:59,630 --> 02:25:00,930
This keychain.

3371
02:25:01,470 --> 02:25:02,730
Here it is.

3372
02:25:02,970 --> 02:25:04,990
The key for the server room.

3373
02:25:05,130 --> 02:25:05,610
Yes.

3374
02:25:07,290 --> 02:25:07,850
Nice.

3375
02:25:09,390 --> 02:25:09,950
Okay.

3376
02:25:11,690 --> 02:25:12,470
Oh, sorry.

3377
02:25:12,590 --> 02:25:12,810
My bad.

3378
02:25:13,310 --> 02:25:13,990
Oh, no.

3379
02:25:14,090 --> 02:25:15,090
Wait, should I shut the...

3380
02:25:15,090 --> 02:25:15,650
You know what?

3381
02:25:15,650 --> 02:25:15,890
Never mind.

3382
02:25:15,970 --> 02:25:16,050
It's fine.

3383
02:25:17,290 --> 02:25:18,370
It's probably okay.

3384
02:25:19,030 --> 02:25:19,550
Oh.

3385
02:25:19,650 --> 02:25:20,390
What's this tab?

3386
02:25:21,330 --> 02:25:21,870
Oh.

3387
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:33,070
Maybe Sophie got kidnapped because Blank wanted to...

3388
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:41,120
Oh, no.

3389
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:45,000
Sophie got kidnapped because Sophie wanted to snitch.

3390
02:25:45,940 --> 02:25:47,780
Sophie got kidnapped?

3391
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:50,640
There must be more to this.

3392
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:51,480
Yeah.

3393
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,240
Dun, dun, dun.

3394
02:25:54,360 --> 02:25:55,240
Oh, my gosh.

3395
02:25:55,260 --> 02:25:55,960
So crazy.

3396
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:57,600
The story is so crazy now.

3397
02:25:58,300 --> 02:25:59,620
Let's go to the server room.

3398
02:25:59,660 --> 02:26:01,700
I've been wanting to go in here the whole time.

3399
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:04,940
Let's see what's hidden in here.

3400
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:05,620
Yeah.

3401
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:08,680
What are you doing?

3402
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:10,080
Uh...

3403
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:12,720
Secret detective business.

3404
02:26:13,020 --> 02:26:13,240
Yeah.

3405
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:14,260
Secret detective business.

3406
02:26:14,420 --> 02:26:14,620
Hmm.

3407
02:26:15,980 --> 02:26:16,860
Don't mind me.

3408
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:18,360
Don't mind me.

3409
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:20,060
Agatha Minty.

3410
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:20,440
Oh.

3411
02:26:20,580 --> 02:26:20,620
Oh, my goodness.

3412
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:28,200
The electrical sparks and blinking lights created a claustrophobic atmosphere.

3413
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:31,020
I don't think they should be sparking.

3414
02:26:31,140 --> 02:26:34,680
I definitely felt that I wasn't supposed to be here.

3415
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:35,620
My meeting time?

3416
02:26:36,660 --> 02:26:38,140
It's in 45 minutes.

3417
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:39,500
Or 40 minutes.

3418
02:26:39,820 --> 02:26:40,680
35 minutes.

3419
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:42,220
I'm okay.

3420
02:26:43,540 --> 02:26:44,820
This is his room.

3421
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:47,680
This is the penguin's room.

3422
02:26:47,900 --> 02:26:50,000
He got his little TV like he wanted, eh?

3423
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,060
Me!

3424
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:52,460
Oh.

3425
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:55,260
Packs under eyes.

3426
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:55,980
Anxious.

3427
02:26:56,300 --> 02:26:59,320
I look way worse than I expected to.

3428
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:01,300
Tattered hat.

3429
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:01,920
Poor.

3430
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:04,580
No, no, no.

3431
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:06,400
We're just unassuming.

3432
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:07,600
Just like Columbo.

3433
02:27:07,820 --> 02:27:11,720
We wear an ugly, frumpled hat.

3434
02:27:11,900 --> 02:27:15,200
And an ugly, frumpled jacket.

3435
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:19,140
Because we want them to think that we're a bad detective.

3436
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:19,980
When we're really smart.

3437
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:20,380
And we're smart.

3438
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:22,280
Breadcrumbs.

3439
02:27:22,280 --> 02:27:22,800
Shame.

3440
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:27,420
Those fingernails, man.

3441
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:29,020
He looks like he's been biting them.

3442
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:31,460
Has that been there the whole day?

3443
02:27:31,860 --> 02:27:32,740
Oh my gosh.

3444
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:34,120
Duck detective.

3445
02:27:35,540 --> 02:27:37,080
I'm watching your Instagram streams.

3446
02:27:37,220 --> 02:27:38,060
Thank you.

3447
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:42,100
Okay, let's start here.

3448
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:44,420
What's he keeping in all these boxes?

3449
02:27:44,820 --> 02:27:45,180
Books?

3450
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:45,960
Salami?

3451
02:27:47,780 --> 02:27:48,980
Why don't you open it up?

3452
02:27:48,980 --> 02:27:51,980
I don't think it's meant to do this.

3453
02:27:52,100 --> 02:27:52,920
I don't think so either.

3454
02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:54,240
Okay.

3455
02:27:57,360 --> 02:27:58,300
Oh, hold on.

3456
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:01,820
Honestly, this is nicer than my apartment.

3457
02:28:02,060 --> 02:28:02,920
Don't say that.

3458
02:28:03,160 --> 02:28:04,400
Don't say that.

3459
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:07,100
We'll rough it up a little bit.

3460
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:08,580
Easy.

3461
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:14,500
Bearbus 100 Schmark voucher.

3462
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:15,760
No one use 100...

3463
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:18,220
Now selling for 80 Schmark.

3464
02:28:18,980 --> 02:28:20,960
They're using the vouchers.

3465
02:28:21,660 --> 02:28:23,180
To get rich.

3466
02:28:24,740 --> 02:28:26,800
Bearbus 100 Schmark voucher.

3467
02:28:27,220 --> 02:28:28,000
Lisa.

3468
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:29,920
How to delete...

3469
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:30,940
Delete?

3470
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:36,300
How to delete Ize selling history.

3471
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:38,360
Manipulate history.

3472
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:39,260
Confusing message.

3473
02:28:39,420 --> 02:28:40,540
Computer illiterate.

3474
02:28:40,620 --> 02:28:42,140
Dad, this is not Google.

3475
02:28:43,810 --> 02:28:45,100
Camera 03 playback.

3476
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:50,800
CCTV.

3477
02:28:51,900 --> 02:28:55,000
What's up with these Bearbus vouchers on Ize?

3478
02:28:57,480 --> 02:28:59,260
Oh my goodness.

3479
02:28:59,500 --> 02:28:59,920
Whoa.

3480
02:29:01,560 --> 02:29:03,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3481
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:13,480
So, Rufus blackmailed Manfred to make him stay quiet about...

3482
02:29:20,200 --> 02:29:21,320
Is it...

3483
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:21,800
Is it...

3484
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:27,440
I guess Rufus legally selling lovers.

3485
02:29:28,060 --> 02:29:28,620
Vouchers.

3486
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:32,120
Blank is the one that provides the blank to blank.

3487
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:34,940
So, one that provides the...

3488
02:29:34,940 --> 02:29:43,700
Oh, Margaret is the one that provides the vouchers to Rufus.

3489
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,760
Dun, dun, dun.

3490
02:29:46,980 --> 02:29:50,600
So, this is what Rufus and Margaret were doing with the vouchers.

3491
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:51,740
Dun, dun, dun.

3492
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:57,060
It might be illegal, but this wasn't what I was here for.

3493
02:29:57,980 --> 02:30:00,880
I needed to catch the salami bandit.

3494
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:01,180
Yeah.

3495
02:30:02,180 --> 02:30:05,560
I quickly needed to find out where Sophie was being kept.

3496
02:30:06,100 --> 02:30:10,120
I also couldn't let the salami bandit get away with this.

3497
02:30:10,220 --> 02:30:10,480
No.

3498
02:30:10,760 --> 02:30:14,760
It was finally time to find out who was behind everything.

3499
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:16,680
Okay.

3500
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:18,540
Oh, Sophie is at...

3501
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:25,580
Who?

3502
02:30:27,100 --> 02:30:27,660
Cake?

3503
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:31,060
Sophie is inside the cake.

3504
02:30:31,340 --> 02:30:32,820
She's been baked.

3505
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:34,040
Oh, my God.

3506
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:36,200
She's so cool.

3507
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:37,340
The whole office is...

3508
02:30:37,340 --> 02:30:38,580
What are you doing in there?

3509
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:41,440
Snooping around, are we?

3510
02:30:41,660 --> 02:30:41,960
Oh.

3511
02:30:42,440 --> 02:30:44,360
That room is strictly off limits.

3512
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:46,300
I even put up posters.

3513
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:49,720
This is for important detective work.

3514
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:50,220
Yeah.

3515
02:30:50,260 --> 02:30:51,140
Stand your ground, detective.

3516
02:30:51,380 --> 02:30:51,660
Oh.

3517
02:30:51,700 --> 02:30:51,720
Oh.

3518
02:30:51,740 --> 02:30:52,640
I'm just going to...

3519
02:30:56,690 --> 02:30:57,170
I'm going to...

3520
02:31:01,270 --> 02:31:02,890
Did you kidnap her?

3521
02:31:03,750 --> 02:31:04,730
Take winner back?

3522
02:31:05,410 --> 02:31:06,250
Was it you?

3523
02:31:07,810 --> 02:31:08,410
Hi, man.

3524
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:09,930
I hope you have fun at Ace and Mwah.

3525
02:31:10,350 --> 02:31:11,230
That's cool.

3526
02:31:13,550 --> 02:31:14,450
Thank you.

3527
02:31:15,470 --> 02:31:16,950
Also, Butwise operator.

3528
02:31:17,270 --> 02:31:17,890
Welcome to my membership.

3529
02:31:18,030 --> 02:31:18,430
Thank you.

3530
02:31:19,070 --> 02:31:19,550
Okay.

3531
02:31:21,610 --> 02:31:23,290
But he was looking at the CCTV.

3532
02:31:23,330 --> 02:31:23,370
Oh, that's cool.

3533
02:31:23,390 --> 02:31:23,530
TV.

3534
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:26,430
I wanted to check real quick.

3535
02:31:26,690 --> 02:31:28,470
Ducks are named after Sir Geoffrey Duck.

3536
02:31:28,850 --> 02:31:29,290
Wow.

3537
02:31:32,260 --> 02:31:33,140
Okay, one second.

3538
02:31:33,440 --> 02:31:34,600
I think he dropped something.

3539
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:35,120
Oh, did he?

3540
02:31:36,380 --> 02:31:37,560
Wait, did he actually?

3541
02:31:37,740 --> 02:31:38,460
Did I miss it?

3542
02:31:40,340 --> 02:31:41,100
I go check.

3543
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,660
No, this is here the whole time.

3544
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:52,100
Let's see the last dialed number on this phone.

3545
02:31:52,300 --> 02:31:54,980
I don't know if that has to do with anything.

3546
02:31:56,820 --> 02:31:57,700
The number.

3547
02:31:57,800 --> 02:32:00,020
But I wanted to talk to what's-his-name first too.

3548
02:32:08,930 --> 02:32:09,810
Hello, sir.

3549
02:32:11,670 --> 02:32:12,570
What do you think it is?

3550
02:32:12,670 --> 02:32:14,470
Have you seen Sophie's resignation?

3551
02:32:16,530 --> 02:32:16,970
No.

3552
02:32:17,590 --> 02:32:19,630
I can't say it comes as a surprise.

3553
02:32:19,850 --> 02:32:21,090
But Hugh wrote the letter.

3554
02:32:21,110 --> 02:32:21,750
She never pretended.

3555
02:32:21,850 --> 02:32:23,150
I particularly enjoyed her job.

3556
02:32:23,450 --> 02:32:27,370
It's difficult finding replacements nowadays, though.

3557
02:32:29,210 --> 02:32:33,950
It's not really a detective's job to spin crazy conspiracy theories, is it?

3558
02:32:34,470 --> 02:32:37,070
Sometimes the truth is pretty crazy.

3559
02:32:37,550 --> 02:32:39,090
Seems a bit cheap.

3560
02:32:43,880 --> 02:32:45,220
Cheap added as a clue.

3561
02:32:45,620 --> 02:32:47,140
Where are these clues anyway?

3562
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:54,020
Oh no, I'm in the... It's my... You've hit rock bottom.

3563
02:32:54,180 --> 02:32:54,400
Go back.

3564
02:32:54,400 --> 02:32:54,400
It's my problem, Eugene.

3565
02:32:54,740 --> 02:32:56,300
I can only go up from here.

3566
02:32:56,900 --> 02:32:58,080
Who am I kidding?

3567
02:32:58,300 --> 02:32:59,280
This is so sad.

3568
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:04,980
Yeah, the handwriting is the exact same.

3569
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:07,420
It's all in all three of these.

3570
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:10,260
Okay.

3571
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:12,060
What am I doing?

3572
02:33:12,220 --> 02:33:12,880
Oh, the kidnapping.

3573
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:14,320
And the salami bandit.

3574
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:18,620
Blank is the salami bandit because blanks and his environment were blank.

3575
02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:32,240
Oh...

3576
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:33,260
Oh...

3577
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:37,140
Okay, we got two things we got to figure out.

3578
02:33:37,620 --> 02:33:47,780
Sophie is at Bear Bus's... maybe... maybe...

3579
02:33:47,780 --> 02:33:48,560
What's his name?

3580
02:33:48,900 --> 02:33:56,440
Manfred's office in... wait, huh?

3581
02:33:57,220 --> 02:34:00,600
Oh, in a... oh, wait, where would she be?

3582
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:01,980
In a box.

3583
02:34:05,420 --> 02:34:07,000
We have all things we need, apparently.

3584
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:08,260
Apparently, yes, we do.

3585
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:10,360
Everything to solve the case and everything.

3586
02:34:11,200 --> 02:34:13,180
Is she in the... is she in the cake?

3587
02:34:16,660 --> 02:34:18,000
No way, that'd be crazy.

3588
02:34:21,380 --> 02:34:22,200
She's in a box.

3589
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:23,220
Just a box, everybody.

3590
02:34:31,210 --> 02:34:32,790
Wait, unless she's in...

3591
02:34:35,550 --> 02:34:37,330
Rufus's office in a box.

3592
02:34:39,230 --> 02:34:39,750
Dang.

3593
02:34:39,910 --> 02:34:41,750
Well, he even was just like, what's in these boxes?

3594
02:34:41,910 --> 02:34:43,010
Unless she's in...

3595
02:34:49,450 --> 02:34:50,590
Is she on the bus?

3596
02:34:51,170 --> 02:34:52,430
Did he take her to the bus?

3597
02:34:54,170 --> 02:34:54,690
Oh!

3598
02:34:54,690 --> 02:34:55,930
Bear Bus's office?

3599
02:34:56,850 --> 02:34:58,210
Oh my god!

3600
02:34:59,170 --> 02:35:00,830
That's where she is being kept!

3601
02:35:02,610 --> 02:35:03,690
She's in a fight!

3602
02:35:03,790 --> 02:35:05,430
It's important that I stayed calm now.

3603
02:35:05,670 --> 02:35:09,790
She's in a fight with... with her... with... for her life!

3604
02:35:10,070 --> 02:35:11,690
I couldn't alert the culprit.

3605
02:35:12,110 --> 02:35:13,370
Or all of it.

3606
02:35:13,390 --> 02:35:14,590
This will have been for nothing.

3607
02:35:15,050 --> 02:35:18,390
I needed to first figure out who is behind everything.

3608
02:35:18,950 --> 02:35:20,610
So I could confront them.

3609
02:35:21,890 --> 02:35:26,410
Yeah, I thought it might be the bus because he's out here.

3610
02:35:26,730 --> 02:35:28,790
So I figured maybe he took her to the bus.

3611
02:35:29,050 --> 02:35:31,230
The most trendy duck hairstyle is a mullet.

3612
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:32,150
Nice.

3613
02:35:32,370 --> 02:35:34,610
And also, this is closed now.

3614
02:35:34,870 --> 02:35:35,810
So, um...

3615
02:35:38,190 --> 02:35:39,050
Hey, you.

3616
02:35:40,170 --> 02:35:41,130
Salami Bandit.

3617
02:35:41,490 --> 02:35:41,970
Salami Bandit.

3618
02:35:41,970 --> 02:35:45,210
Manfred is the Salami Bandit because...

3619
02:35:46,250 --> 02:35:48,410
Maybe Rufus and his...

3620
02:35:50,750 --> 02:35:52,110
Whoa, there's so much hair.

3621
02:35:53,030 --> 02:35:55,010
Oh wait, because, uh...

3622
02:35:55,010 --> 02:36:01,510
Because the Salami Bandits and his handwriting are identical.

3623
02:36:03,730 --> 02:36:04,170
Yeah!

3624
02:36:04,850 --> 02:36:07,350
Manfred is the Salami Bandit!

3625
02:36:08,770 --> 02:36:09,650
Rafalga!

3626
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:10,390
Welcome to Banbusha!

3627
02:36:10,490 --> 02:36:10,970
Thank you!

3628
02:36:12,350 --> 02:36:13,790
That makes a lot of sense.

3629
02:36:13,870 --> 02:36:14,670
That makes a lot of sense.

3630
02:36:14,790 --> 02:36:15,090
Wait.

3631
02:36:15,290 --> 02:36:16,530
Oh, thank you for the raid!

3632
02:36:17,570 --> 02:36:18,030
Call me!

3633
02:36:19,290 --> 02:36:23,250
Sorry, I have to, like, lean in super far to be able to read the raid messages now.

3634
02:36:24,330 --> 02:36:25,950
Thanks for the clown raid!

3635
02:36:28,390 --> 02:36:29,330
Thank you, thank you!

3636
02:36:31,010 --> 02:36:32,250
Hope you had a fun stream.

3637
02:36:32,650 --> 02:36:33,190
Honk, honk!

3638
02:36:34,430 --> 02:36:35,770
I'm just at the end of the game.

3639
02:36:35,930 --> 02:36:37,130
So, if you guys...

3640
02:36:37,130 --> 02:36:37,850
If you were gonna play...

3641
02:36:37,850 --> 02:36:38,490
If you were gonna...

3642
02:36:38,490 --> 02:36:40,050
If you were gonna play it...

3643
02:36:40,050 --> 02:36:40,850
Maybe don't...

3644
02:36:40,850 --> 02:36:41,670
Don't watch.

3645
02:36:41,970 --> 02:36:42,810
Ha ha ha ha.

3646
02:36:44,210 --> 02:36:44,810
Ironic.

3647
02:36:45,010 --> 02:36:46,770
That is hand written note.

3648
02:36:46,870 --> 02:36:48,690
That's meant to frame Fredersen.

3649
02:36:49,190 --> 02:36:51,470
Oh, uh, paperbacks thanks to the five gifted!

3650
02:36:51,590 --> 02:36:52,590
And versticks for the five gifted.

3651
02:36:53,190 --> 02:36:55,830
Ended up incriminating Manfred instead.

3652
02:36:56,370 --> 02:36:57,310
Dun dun dun!

3653
02:36:57,890 --> 02:36:59,770
Something was missing here.

3654
02:37:00,030 --> 02:37:02,390
Who else was involved with this?

3655
02:37:02,610 --> 02:37:04,810
I had collected everything I needed.

3656
02:37:04,970 --> 02:37:05,070
Hm.

3657
02:37:05,350 --> 02:37:07,630
I just had to organize my thoughts.

3658
02:37:07,890 --> 02:37:08,230
Ok.

3659
02:37:09,350 --> 02:37:09,950
Uh...

3660
02:37:12,790 --> 02:37:21,250
Okay, so maybe... that's why she got kidnapped because Boris was in on it and that's why she was like, I'm gonna come clean.

3661
02:37:32,470 --> 02:37:33,590
The murdering!

3662
02:37:38,770 --> 02:37:39,890
The importing.

3663
02:37:42,190 --> 02:37:43,170
God, I wish.

3664
02:37:44,150 --> 02:37:45,290
God, I wish.

3665
02:37:47,390 --> 02:37:48,770
The slimy bandit wasn't working alone.

3666
02:37:49,230 --> 02:37:49,510
No.

3667
02:37:49,910 --> 02:37:52,930
It made sense for the bus driver to be involved.

3668
02:37:53,310 --> 02:37:53,530
Yeah.

3669
02:37:54,890 --> 02:37:55,870
Oh, there's more?

3670
02:37:56,910 --> 02:37:57,550
Infatuation?

3671
02:37:58,070 --> 02:38:02,870
He used to date... wait.

3672
02:38:04,310 --> 02:38:09,730
Boris is the accomplice because he used to date... Sophie.

3673
02:38:10,090 --> 02:38:14,890
And the slimy bandit needed someone who could convince someone into murdering.

3674
02:38:17,530 --> 02:38:18,410
Wait a second.

3675
02:38:18,610 --> 02:38:19,970
The infatuation.

3676
02:38:25,370 --> 02:38:26,310
Tensai minto.

3677
02:38:26,710 --> 02:38:27,630
Don't say that.

3678
02:38:29,130 --> 02:38:29,770
Don't say that.

3679
02:38:34,290 --> 02:38:35,970
After what happened earlier.

3680
02:38:40,490 --> 02:38:42,110
He used to date Sophie.

3681
02:38:42,430 --> 02:38:45,290
Boris used to date... but why would he be an accomplice?

3682
02:38:45,290 --> 02:38:51,170
He needed to convince Sophie into dating.

3683
02:38:51,490 --> 02:38:52,130
What does that mean?

3684
02:38:52,290 --> 02:38:52,450
No.

3685
02:38:52,810 --> 02:38:53,710
Into helping?

3686
02:38:54,210 --> 02:38:54,670
Or...

3687
02:38:57,070 --> 02:38:58,970
Convince her to snitch... oh, selling.

3688
02:38:59,270 --> 02:38:59,730
Wait!

3689
02:39:01,810 --> 02:39:04,810
Who would be... oh, maybe... oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3690
02:39:07,890 --> 02:39:08,810
Oh, no.

3691
02:39:09,690 --> 02:39:10,150
Hmm...

3692
02:39:14,630 --> 02:39:16,090
Three or more things are wrong.

3693
02:39:16,090 --> 02:39:17,910
I thought maybe he would get her in on it.

3694
02:39:17,990 --> 02:39:18,570
Like, hey...

3695
02:39:21,610 --> 02:39:24,750
Like, hey, Sophie, we need a third person in here.

3696
02:39:26,090 --> 02:39:27,470
Switch Boris and Sophie?

3697
02:39:31,130 --> 02:39:31,870
Oh, maybe.

3698
02:39:33,010 --> 02:39:33,510
Boris...

3699
02:39:33,510 --> 02:39:34,490
No.

3700
02:39:36,490 --> 02:39:37,250
Wait, no.

3701
02:39:39,070 --> 02:39:39,570
Enemy.

3702
02:39:41,350 --> 02:39:43,570
Sophie is the slimy bandit's enemy.

3703
02:39:46,090 --> 02:39:54,570
So Boris is the slimy bandit's accomplice because he used to date Sophie and the slimy bandit needed someone...

3704
02:39:54,570 --> 02:39:54,670
How?

3705
02:39:56,450 --> 02:39:58,610
Boris dates Boris... Sophie dates Sophie.

3706
02:40:01,790 --> 02:40:03,430
Maybe you're thinking about it wrong.

3707
02:40:03,610 --> 02:40:04,790
Maybe accomplice is wrong.

3708
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:13,420
You read her phone.

3709
02:40:13,900 --> 02:40:15,360
Yeah, and on the phone...

3710
02:40:16,380 --> 02:40:17,160
Oh, wait...

3711
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:18,120
He...

3712
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:18,600
Oh, no.

3713
02:40:19,020 --> 02:40:19,540
Uh...

3714
02:40:19,540 --> 02:40:22,440
Here said, I'll tell them everything.

3715
02:40:22,860 --> 02:40:23,380
Don't.

3716
02:40:23,380 --> 02:40:24,940
And then she blocks them.

3717
02:40:32,550 --> 02:40:33,070
Right?

3718
02:40:33,190 --> 02:40:34,150
They were dating.

3719
02:40:34,510 --> 02:40:38,810
It has to be Boris and... about Sophie and Boris because they're the only ones that were dating.

3720
02:40:39,830 --> 02:40:43,990
Pretty sure Penguin Man and Margaret are still... still a thing.

3721
02:40:47,950 --> 02:40:50,110
Thank you so much for playing and enjoying the game.

3722
02:40:50,110 --> 02:40:50,250
My name...

3723
02:40:50,250 --> 02:40:53,370
My name is Deshawn Ricks and I voice Man for the Bear.

3724
02:40:53,870 --> 02:40:54,790
Oh, my God.

3725
02:40:56,350 --> 02:40:57,790
Thank you for dropping by.

3726
02:40:59,510 --> 02:41:00,770
It's so much fun.

3727
02:41:01,690 --> 02:41:03,830
And everybody's voice acting is so wonderful.

3728
02:41:03,990 --> 02:41:04,530
Thank you.

3729
02:41:05,050 --> 02:41:06,930
Oh, sorry if I'm like...

3730
02:41:06,930 --> 02:41:08,910
I just kind of...

3731
02:41:08,910 --> 02:41:09,910
Well, you know...

3732
02:41:09,910 --> 02:41:10,430
You're...

3733
02:41:10,430 --> 02:41:14,170
I think I'm about to arrest you, maybe.

3734
02:41:14,370 --> 02:41:15,350
But, you know...

3735
02:41:19,550 --> 02:41:20,090
You're...

3736
02:41:20,090 --> 02:41:20,770
Thank you for dropping by.

3737
02:41:23,590 --> 02:41:25,030
Everybody thinks they're the five gifted.

3738
02:41:26,670 --> 02:41:28,250
But I'm a little stupid right now.

3739
02:41:28,310 --> 02:41:28,710
Don't watch.

3740
02:41:33,430 --> 02:41:34,330
Oh, let's see.

3741
02:41:36,750 --> 02:41:40,730
I had a hair on my mic and I was like, it's tickling my face.

3742
02:41:41,170 --> 02:41:42,750
I'm really glad it's not a spider.

3743
02:41:43,030 --> 02:41:44,790
It was a hair on my mic.

3744
02:41:44,950 --> 02:41:45,930
How did I get there?

3745
02:41:50,750 --> 02:41:51,190
Um...

3746
02:41:55,740 --> 02:41:57,120
What do you mean gross?

3747
02:41:58,220 --> 02:41:59,160
It's just a hair.

3748
02:41:59,340 --> 02:42:00,100
It's my own hair.

3749
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:03,760
I think it fell off my head.

3750
02:42:04,260 --> 02:42:04,920
Oh, gosh.

3751
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:05,500
I'm balding.

3752
02:42:07,960 --> 02:42:08,880
Anyway, what was it?

3753
02:42:08,940 --> 02:42:09,080
Okay.

3754
02:42:09,780 --> 02:42:10,340
Let's see.

3755
02:42:10,600 --> 02:42:12,080
Boris is the salami...

3756
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:14,220
Or Blank is the salami bandits...

3757
02:42:14,220 --> 02:42:15,180
Not lover.

3758
02:42:18,460 --> 02:42:18,900
Accomplice...

3759
02:42:20,960 --> 02:42:22,720
Because he used to date Sophie.

3760
02:42:23,020 --> 02:42:25,840
And the salami bandit needed someone who could convince...

3761
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:30,400
The duck detective.

3762
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:35,000
But I have three or more things wrong.

3763
02:42:45,490 --> 02:42:47,150
So close but so far.

3764
02:42:48,870 --> 02:42:50,930
Would it be that she's an accomplice then?

3765
02:42:51,730 --> 02:42:55,190
Sophie is an accomplice because she used to date Boris.

3766
02:42:56,630 --> 02:42:58,910
And needed someone who could convince...

3767
02:42:59,410 --> 02:43:00,490
I don't think it's the...

3768
02:43:00,490 --> 02:43:01,430
Oh, wait.

3769
02:43:03,050 --> 02:43:03,610
No.

3770
02:43:03,970 --> 02:43:05,450
Convince someone else, maybe.

3771
02:43:10,690 --> 02:43:12,830
Salami bandit needed someone who could convince...

3772
02:43:12,830 --> 02:43:14,310
Into selling?

3773
02:43:14,610 --> 02:43:15,170
No.

3774
02:43:16,950 --> 02:43:17,510
Convince...

3775
02:43:17,510 --> 02:43:18,710
Boris into selling?

3776
02:43:20,210 --> 02:43:20,930
Well, he...

3777
02:43:20,930 --> 02:43:21,970
Oh, into helping.

3778
02:43:22,450 --> 02:43:24,890
I feel like helping and selling are like...

3779
02:43:24,890 --> 02:43:25,110
I couldn't believe...

3780
02:43:25,110 --> 02:43:27,250
Sophie managed to talk Boris into this.

3781
02:43:27,290 --> 02:43:28,890
I feel like helping and selling are...

3782
02:43:28,890 --> 02:43:30,110
Are pretty close.

3783
02:43:30,190 --> 02:43:30,870
So it was...

3784
02:43:30,870 --> 02:43:32,050
Between one of them.

3785
02:43:33,330 --> 02:43:33,790
Aha!

3786
02:43:34,770 --> 02:43:36,610
I had it all figured out now.

3787
02:43:37,310 --> 02:43:39,950
It was time that I confront the culprits.

3788
02:43:40,170 --> 02:43:41,090
Time to confront.

3789
02:43:41,470 --> 02:43:42,230
But first...

3790
02:43:42,230 --> 02:43:42,570
More?

3791
02:43:42,750 --> 02:43:44,010
I had to free Sophie.

3792
02:43:45,510 --> 02:43:47,110
Sophie, I'm coming for you.

3793
02:43:47,530 --> 02:43:48,570
Oh, there she is.

3794
02:43:48,710 --> 02:43:49,450
Exactly where I...

3795
02:43:49,450 --> 02:43:49,610
Oh.

3796
02:43:50,370 --> 02:43:50,890
Oh.

3797
02:43:51,150 --> 02:43:51,570
Oh.

3798
02:43:51,910 --> 02:43:52,150
Oh.

3799
02:43:53,050 --> 02:43:53,390
Sophie!

3800
02:44:01,110 --> 02:44:02,690
What's going on out here?

3801
02:44:05,610 --> 02:44:07,350
They're all in on it, including Freddie.

3802
02:44:07,350 --> 02:44:08,230
Why is everyone yelling?

3803
02:44:08,810 --> 02:44:10,170
This looks dramatic.

3804
02:44:11,130 --> 02:44:12,150
Bum bum bum.

3805
02:44:12,170 --> 02:44:12,730
It's...

3806
02:44:12,730 --> 02:44:14,750
Kind of a long story.

3807
02:44:15,310 --> 02:44:21,170
You're very nonchalant for someone who was kidnapped and has participated in illegal activities, Missy.

3808
02:44:21,330 --> 02:44:24,230
And guess who deduced said long story?

3809
02:44:24,530 --> 02:44:24,850
Me!

3810
02:44:25,690 --> 02:44:27,370
The one and only...

3811
02:44:27,370 --> 02:44:27,530
Sophie!

3812
02:44:27,530 --> 02:44:28,690
Duck Detective!

3813
02:44:32,250 --> 02:44:33,850
Read the room.

3814
02:44:34,250 --> 02:44:34,850
Oh my god.

3815
02:44:35,150 --> 02:44:37,830
This is how everything went down.

3816
02:44:39,590 --> 02:44:45,370
The Bretzel Bearbus branch was suffering losses and had their budget cut as a result.

3817
02:44:45,510 --> 02:44:45,770
Uh oh.

3818
02:44:46,130 --> 02:44:52,730
Manfred, worried about the financial stability of his family, felt himself backed into a corner.

3819
02:44:52,930 --> 02:44:53,510
Oh my god.

3820
02:44:53,990 --> 02:44:56,170
This is when he became...

3821
02:44:56,170 --> 02:44:57,510
The Salon!

3822
02:44:57,530 --> 02:44:58,370
The salami bandit!

3823
02:44:58,470 --> 02:45:04,850
He made his grand plan of salami smuggling and realized he couldn't do this alone.

3824
02:45:05,250 --> 02:45:05,750
Dun dun.

3825
02:45:06,450 --> 02:45:11,070
He recruited Boris, since it would be easiest for the bus driver...

3826
02:45:11,070 --> 02:45:11,490
Right, right.

3827
02:45:11,550 --> 02:45:14,130
To load and unload the wares discreetly.

3828
02:45:14,490 --> 02:45:15,050
Discreetly.

3829
02:45:15,070 --> 02:45:19,190
The bus would go through a customs check at the Salsiccia bus station first.

3830
02:45:19,490 --> 02:45:19,770
Uh huh.

3831
02:45:21,210 --> 02:45:26,410
And then, Boris would take a detour to get the salami and load it onto the bus.

3832
02:45:26,610 --> 02:45:27,510
Dun dun dun.

3833
02:45:27,530 --> 02:45:30,110
This is why the buses always had a huge delay.

3834
02:45:30,430 --> 02:45:30,950
Mmmmm.

3835
02:45:31,470 --> 02:45:37,950
It wouldn't be easy to talk Boris into crime, so Manfred convinced Sophie to join the team.

3836
02:45:38,030 --> 02:45:38,810
That's so messed up!

3837
02:45:39,230 --> 02:45:44,670
Boris's obsession with her would make it easy for her to manipulate him into helping with the plan.

3838
02:45:45,270 --> 02:45:45,610
That's so sad.

3839
02:45:45,750 --> 02:45:48,070
How good do the illegal salamis taste?

3840
02:45:48,150 --> 02:45:48,710
Everything was going well until...

3841
02:45:48,710 --> 02:45:50,850
The Duck Detective!

3842
02:45:51,390 --> 02:45:52,230
Mets me.

3843
02:45:52,870 --> 02:45:53,970
Infiltrated the office.

3844
02:45:54,310 --> 02:45:54,650
Yeah.

3845
02:45:55,370 --> 02:45:57,470
Freddie was meant to be the skeeter.

3846
02:45:57,470 --> 02:45:57,490
The Duck Detective!

3847
02:45:57,490 --> 02:45:58,230
Manfred was the secret code for the crime.

3848
02:45:58,470 --> 02:46:00,790
But I'm not fooled that easily.

3849
02:46:01,070 --> 02:46:01,450
Nope.

3850
02:46:02,110 --> 02:46:07,830
Sophie began getting cold feet and ultimately wanted to confess to the police.

3851
02:46:08,170 --> 02:46:09,430
But who called the Duck?

3852
02:46:09,530 --> 02:46:09,930
It was Laura!

3853
02:46:10,210 --> 02:46:13,330
Manfred couldn't have this so he interfered.

3854
02:46:13,330 --> 02:46:17,210
Laura called so that she could figure out who stole her lunch.

3855
02:46:17,350 --> 02:46:20,670
In an outburst of panic he abducted her and hid her in the luggage compartment of one of the buses.

3856
02:46:21,890 --> 02:46:22,490
Wowee.

3857
02:46:23,190 --> 02:46:27,470
And this is why Manfred stole the Duck Detective!

3858
02:46:28,430 --> 02:46:30,130
Dun dun dun!

3859
02:46:39,610 --> 02:46:43,710
Why would you do that though?

3860
02:46:43,950 --> 02:46:47,670
Oh, is it to get Freddy fired, I guess?

3861
02:46:57,470 --> 02:46:58,530
Wait, we get to choose?

3862
02:47:01,850 --> 02:47:03,510
Time to frame Freddy.

3863
02:47:04,590 --> 02:47:06,810
Should we arrest Freddy anyway?

3864
02:47:08,670 --> 02:47:09,230
I

3865
02:47:15,590 --> 02:47:17,110
kind of want to say no.

3866
02:47:19,590 --> 02:47:22,550
I kind of want to take Freddy downtown.

3867
02:47:25,690 --> 02:47:27,650
Remember, he was blackmailed.

3868
02:47:27,650 --> 02:47:28,010
That's right.

3869
02:47:28,190 --> 02:47:30,790
He was blackmailed by a certain penguin.

3870
02:47:34,010 --> 02:47:37,150
But, he technically didn't get his hands dirty.

3871
02:47:37,870 --> 02:47:40,910
Not to mention what it would do to his poor family.

3872
02:47:41,170 --> 02:47:42,810
Wait, he did get his hands... wait a second.

3873
02:47:42,970 --> 02:47:46,570
Yeah, that's... I mean, if you organize a murder, you still...

3874
02:47:46,570 --> 02:47:49,090
Just because he didn't commit the murder...

3875
02:47:49,090 --> 02:47:50,570
What about Sophie?

3876
02:47:52,070 --> 02:47:55,210
Without her, the smuggling wouldn't have been possible.

3877
02:47:57,290 --> 02:48:01,990
She manipulated poor Boris into taking this lobby across the border.

3878
02:48:02,190 --> 02:48:02,490
He kidnapped a woman.

3879
02:48:02,490 --> 02:48:03,750
Wait, do we get to choose forever?

3880
02:48:03,830 --> 02:48:06,150
Should Sophie get arrested?

3881
02:48:06,410 --> 02:48:08,490
Oh, we can see who gets...

3882
02:48:08,490 --> 02:48:09,930
We can say who gets arrested or not.

3883
02:48:10,530 --> 02:48:12,590
I feel like Sophie should get arrested.

3884
02:48:12,590 --> 02:48:15,550
I feel bad for poor Boris who got manipulated into this.

3885
02:48:17,130 --> 02:48:18,730
I think we should arrest Sophie.

3886
02:48:19,270 --> 02:48:20,990
And that's what they want you to think.

3887
02:48:21,110 --> 02:48:21,530
Maybe.

3888
02:48:23,270 --> 02:48:24,470
On her birthday?

3889
02:48:26,150 --> 02:48:28,790
She can watch KTS from jail.

3890
02:48:29,970 --> 02:48:32,470
What she did was clearly illegal.

3891
02:48:32,470 --> 02:48:33,270
Yeah!

3892
02:48:33,870 --> 02:48:36,090
She needs to face the consequences.

3893
02:48:36,990 --> 02:48:39,250
Boris was at the end of the chain.

3894
02:48:39,830 --> 02:48:45,610
Had he refused to take the salami on board, the plan would have not worked out.

3895
02:48:46,370 --> 02:48:48,370
Should Boris get arrested?

3896
02:48:48,730 --> 02:48:49,210
No!

3897
02:48:50,930 --> 02:48:51,530
Maybe.

3898
02:48:51,890 --> 02:48:54,510
He didn't even realize what was happening.

3899
02:48:54,710 --> 02:48:55,210
I think he did.

3900
02:48:55,510 --> 02:48:57,130
I don't think he's that dumb.

3901
02:48:57,230 --> 02:48:58,410
Maybe he is, I don't know.

3902
02:48:59,090 --> 02:49:02,270
All right, I've made up my mind.

3903
02:49:02,470 --> 02:49:03,730
Wait, what about the penguin, though?

3904
02:49:04,070 --> 02:49:06,530
I will report to the state police.

3905
02:49:06,630 --> 02:49:08,190
Wait, we're only arresting Sophie?

3906
02:49:08,910 --> 02:49:10,450
This is so backwards.

3907
02:49:29,290 --> 02:49:31,590
Only arrest the person who was kidnapped.

3908
02:49:31,730 --> 02:49:34,390
The only person who wanted to turn themselves in.

3909
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:39,440
Sophie!

3910
02:49:40,900 --> 02:49:41,960
What is this?

3911
02:49:41,960 --> 02:49:48,280
If I had known that calling the duck detective would result in this, I would have never done it.

3912
02:49:48,980 --> 02:49:51,700
You were supposed to find out who stole my lunch.

3913
02:49:51,800 --> 02:49:52,940
I did, I told you.

3914
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:54,340
Maybe she's my best friend of smuggling.

3915
02:49:54,840 --> 02:49:57,240
I did, I did do, I did do that.

3916
02:49:57,500 --> 02:49:58,960
Oh no, she's crying again.

3917
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:03,480
I knew this was a bad idea from the beginning.

3918
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:05,120
This is so ducked up.

3919
02:50:05,460 --> 02:50:08,360
Why did Boris have to lose the bag?

3920
02:50:09,380 --> 02:50:10,100
Uh oh.

3921
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:12,540
My God, he is such an idiot!

3922
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:16,940
I had no idea it was that important.

3923
02:50:17,620 --> 02:50:20,080
Why didn't anyone tell me about the plan?

3924
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:22,200
See, he didn't know.

3925
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:24,620
You said your cousin was ill.

3926
02:50:26,740 --> 02:50:31,180
And the only thing that would make her happy was the sausage salamis.

3927
02:50:33,680 --> 02:50:35,580
I should have known.

3928
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:39,580
If you're stupid enough to believe that...

3929
02:50:39,580 --> 02:50:39,860
You know what?

3930
02:50:39,900 --> 02:50:41,200
Yeah, jail for Sophie!

3931
02:50:41,360 --> 02:50:42,460
Jail, jail, jail!

3932
02:50:43,080 --> 02:50:48,360
Then, you're also too stupid to bring a couple sausages across the border.

3933
02:50:48,720 --> 02:50:49,080
You know what?

3934
02:50:49,100 --> 02:50:49,980
I don't, I don't...

3935
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:51,560
Jail, jail, jail!

3936
02:50:57,130 --> 02:50:59,330
You only let the bear off because he's here right now?

3937
02:50:59,410 --> 02:50:59,610
No!

3938
02:51:01,910 --> 02:51:05,550
Wow, you really did quack the case, Mr. Duck Detective.

3939
02:51:06,010 --> 02:51:07,410
Why do you have to say it like that?

3940
02:51:07,570 --> 02:51:09,210
You're just as cool as I imagined.

3941
02:51:09,470 --> 02:51:10,130
Oh, he liked it.

3942
02:51:10,190 --> 02:51:10,310
Okay.

3943
02:51:10,310 --> 02:51:11,190
What now, Fredersen?

3944
02:51:11,630 --> 02:51:13,110
I quacked the case!

3945
02:51:13,330 --> 02:51:15,270
Solved the mystery of the secret salami!

3946
02:51:15,690 --> 02:51:16,770
I got an achievement!

3947
02:51:18,250 --> 02:51:19,450
The truth...

3948
02:51:20,050 --> 02:51:21,030
The truth...

3949
02:51:21,030 --> 02:51:23,090
Is an ugly mistress.

3950
02:51:26,150 --> 02:51:28,350
But it is my duty...

3951
02:51:28,350 --> 02:51:28,790
Oh my god!

3952
02:51:29,470 --> 02:51:32,230
Manfred was in the back smiling about it!

3953
02:51:32,550 --> 02:51:33,830
...of Lady Justice.

3954
02:51:49,660 --> 02:51:51,200
I'm the 2%!

3955
02:51:56,290 --> 02:51:57,190
I can't!

3956
02:52:07,050 --> 02:52:08,250
Oh my god!

3957
02:52:12,630 --> 02:52:13,210
Oh

3958
02:52:18,320 --> 02:52:20,180
god, my meeting is in 8 minutes!

3959
02:52:20,260 --> 02:52:21,820
Hold on, I think they're messaging me.

3960
02:52:22,060 --> 02:52:23,280
Oh gosh!

3961
02:52:30,600 --> 02:52:32,800
I can't believe I won!

3962
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:37,100
This was probably 99% before this run.

3963
02:52:37,100 --> 02:52:38,680
2%!

3964
02:52:38,780 --> 02:52:40,600
It is the mint way, alright!

3965
02:52:43,220 --> 02:52:45,100
I can't believe...

3966
02:52:45,100 --> 02:52:48,380
We are so vastly wrong!

3967
02:52:54,590 --> 02:52:56,130
Oh my gosh!

3968
02:52:56,590 --> 02:52:58,990
My ways are unconventional, everybody!

3969
02:53:01,170 --> 02:53:03,050
My Oshii is in the 2%!

3970
02:53:05,330 --> 02:53:06,630
Well, you know what?

3971
02:53:07,130 --> 02:53:07,810
Probably!

3972
02:53:09,750 --> 02:53:12,610
Probably any other playthrough you'll watch...

3973
02:53:12,610 --> 02:53:14,450
Has Manfred getting arrested.

3974
02:53:14,710 --> 02:53:16,170
So, our playthrough...

3975
02:53:16,170 --> 02:53:17,170
Is unique!

3976
02:53:24,930 --> 02:53:26,050
The vibe!

3977
02:53:29,350 --> 02:53:30,470
Oh gosh!

3978
02:53:30,690 --> 02:53:32,090
Thank you for ducking!

3979
02:53:32,090 --> 02:53:32,970
Good time, Eugene!

3980
02:53:33,110 --> 02:53:34,770
Might not be a Columbo, but...

3981
02:53:35,150 --> 02:53:36,410
He's still a good egg!

3982
02:53:39,750 --> 02:53:41,150
Oh my goodness!

3983
02:53:48,500 --> 02:53:50,640
I love you so much!

3984
02:53:53,440 --> 02:53:55,660
The real free thinker, right?

3985
02:53:56,380 --> 02:53:58,120
I'm gonna recommend this...

3986
02:53:58,120 --> 02:53:59,240
Just to test...

3987
02:54:01,220 --> 02:54:02,780
I can't believe...

3988
02:54:02,780 --> 02:54:04,220
Nothing happened to him!

3989
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:10,060
Oh gosh!

3990
02:54:10,320 --> 02:54:10,980
I'm crying!

3991
02:54:12,120 --> 02:54:14,140
This is why we love you so much!

3992
02:54:14,140 --> 02:54:15,980
I don't know why you're like this...

3993
02:54:15,980 --> 02:54:17,100
But please never change!

3994
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:21,480
I think it was the fact that it was so overwhelmingly...

3995
02:54:21,480 --> 02:54:22,840
If it were like...

3996
02:54:22,840 --> 02:54:25,980
Even 90%, I don't think I would feel so...

3997
02:54:28,120 --> 02:54:30,920
But the fact that it's 98% is insane!

3998
02:54:31,940 --> 02:54:33,100
One more thing!

3999
02:54:36,920 --> 02:54:37,960
Oh gosh!

4000
02:54:40,180 --> 02:54:40,700
Crap!

4001
02:54:40,840 --> 02:54:43,540
Also, shout out to all the voice actors and actresses...

4002
02:54:43,540 --> 02:54:44,360
They did amazing!

4003
02:54:44,600 --> 02:54:47,700
I completely forgot to collect my payment from Laura!

4004
02:54:47,920 --> 02:54:48,240
Oh no!

4005
02:54:48,660 --> 02:54:50,060
Everybody already went home!

4006
02:54:50,180 --> 02:54:50,340
Wait!

4007
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:51,460
We can't...

4008
02:54:51,460 --> 02:54:51,940
We don't have...

4009
02:54:51,940 --> 02:54:53,620
How am I going to pay for the bus?

4010
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:54,280
Oh no!

4011
02:54:55,380 --> 02:54:57,020
Guess I'm walking home!

4012
02:54:58,300 --> 02:54:59,240
Here I go!

4013
02:55:00,780 --> 02:55:01,540
Oh Freddy!

4014
02:55:01,760 --> 02:55:02,040
Ahem!

4015
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:03,860
Need a ride?

4016
02:55:04,600 --> 02:55:05,900
I just booked this one!

4017
02:55:06,100 --> 02:55:07,940
It's been such a long day after all!

4018
02:55:08,780 --> 02:55:10,680
Nobody else doesn't like my Kamiyoshi!

4019
02:55:10,840 --> 02:55:11,620
Oh no!

4020
02:55:12,500 --> 02:55:12,980
No!

4021
02:55:12,980 --> 02:55:13,780
Thank you!

4022
02:55:14,380 --> 02:55:16,700
If Freddy knows where we live, he'll definitely stalk us!

4023
02:55:16,920 --> 02:55:17,160
Come on!

4024
02:55:17,220 --> 02:55:17,760
It'll be fun!

4025
02:55:18,560 --> 02:55:21,580
Plus, you must be tired after all the detective work!

4026
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:24,800
I wonder if there will be a sequel and Freddy will be our assistant in the sequel?

4027
02:55:24,940 --> 02:55:25,720
I really don't!

4028
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:26,440
Please?

4029
02:55:33,080 --> 02:55:33,860
Yeah, fine!

4030
02:55:34,700 --> 02:55:37,320
I'm sure even the VA in the chat couldn't believe he walked!

4031
02:55:37,980 --> 02:55:38,420
Great!

4032
02:55:38,760 --> 02:55:42,880
Now I finally have time to tell you all about my ideas for your social media!

4033
02:55:43,060 --> 02:55:43,420
Oh no!

4034
02:55:44,220 --> 02:55:45,100
Please don't!

4035
02:55:45,100 --> 02:55:45,460
Hahaha!

4036
02:55:45,460 --> 02:55:47,160
I could get you tons of publicity!

4037
02:55:47,480 --> 02:55:49,500
Oh yeah, Freddy my manager!

4038
02:55:50,060 --> 02:55:51,300
Just really need an L.A.

4039
02:55:51,360 --> 02:55:53,400
Noire playthrough now, please, please!

4040
02:55:53,660 --> 02:55:58,520
Usually when I play games like that, people get mad at me in the comments.

4041
02:55:58,600 --> 02:56:00,780
They're just like, why is she doing everything wrong?

4042
02:56:01,160 --> 02:56:02,600
Why is she such a villain?

4043
02:56:02,800 --> 02:56:07,900
And I'm like, don't give me the option to be the villain if you don't want me to be the villain!

4044
02:56:07,900 --> 02:56:08,660
Hahaha!

4045
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:13,640
No...

4046
02:56:14,680 --> 02:56:17,720
And imagine, we can team up!

4047
02:56:18,340 --> 02:56:19,400
Absolutely not.

4048
02:56:19,800 --> 02:56:21,780
And I can be your sidekick!

4049
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:22,440
Aww...

4050
02:56:22,440 --> 02:56:23,320
Freddy is kind of cute.

4051
02:56:23,860 --> 02:56:24,460
Aww...

4052
02:56:24,460 --> 02:56:27,040
I know, I'm a VTuber.

4053
02:56:28,520 --> 02:56:29,720
Oh man...

4054
02:56:29,720 --> 02:56:30,520
The end!

4055
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:33,800
Yippee!

4056
02:56:34,180 --> 02:56:36,240
Just in time for my meeting, perfect.

4057
02:56:36,780 --> 02:56:37,760
I have to pee so bad.

4058
02:56:37,760 --> 02:56:37,880
I have to pee so bad.

4059
02:56:37,880 --> 02:56:38,460
This is so bad though.

4060
02:56:38,540 --> 02:56:40,300
Oh my gosh, I've had to pee for like the past half hour.

4061
02:56:41,140 --> 02:56:43,680
Thank you guys for joining me for Duck Detective!

4062
02:56:43,940 --> 02:56:45,680
If there's a sequel, I will play it.

4063
02:56:45,740 --> 02:56:46,560
This is so much fun.

4064
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:57,400
I'm sorry for kind of skewing the polls a little bit in terms of Manfred walking free, but it was great.

4065
02:57:01,020 --> 02:57:02,540
Baldur's Gate 3 evil playthrough.

4066
02:57:03,460 --> 02:57:07,380
I would do something like that, but I think Baldur's Gate is just way too long.

4067
02:57:10,400 --> 02:57:21,160
But yeah, I really thought something was going to happen to the penguin and the sheep lady, but nothing.

4068
02:57:22,780 --> 02:57:26,620
I guess, you know, justice can't always be served.

4069
02:57:27,060 --> 02:57:28,960
I didn't know my Oshi was a bad girl.

4070
02:57:30,960 --> 02:57:34,300
I would stick around and talk more with you guys, but I really gotta go.

4071
02:57:34,500 --> 02:57:37,860
So thank you so much for joining me today, even though I was a little late.

4072
02:57:37,880 --> 02:57:39,200
A little silly, but...

4073
02:57:40,780 --> 02:57:44,260
I'm sorry I was so stupid during that one part.

4074
02:57:46,360 --> 02:57:46,800
But...

4075
02:57:48,640 --> 02:57:49,880
We got the rest of it.

4076
02:57:50,460 --> 02:57:51,640
I got the rest of it.

4077
02:57:51,800 --> 02:57:52,940
With my big brain.

4078
02:57:53,680 --> 02:57:54,940
I just took a...

4079
02:57:54,940 --> 02:57:56,040
There was like a...

4080
02:57:56,040 --> 02:57:58,660
There was a salami stuck in my brain cogs, okay?

4081
02:57:59,440 --> 02:57:59,880
Anyway...

4082
02:58:01,280 --> 02:58:02,100
Thank you guys!

4083
02:58:02,460 --> 02:58:03,400
Have a great night.

4084
02:58:03,540 --> 02:58:03,640
Oh!

4085
02:58:03,860 --> 02:58:05,040
I can show you...

4086
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:05,840
Tomorrow!

4087
02:58:08,280 --> 02:58:08,720
Tomorrow...

4088
02:58:08,720 --> 02:58:09,900
I did make a schedule.

4089
02:58:10,020 --> 02:58:10,720
I gotta post it.

4090
02:58:10,940 --> 02:58:13,060
I will post it after my meeting, most likely.

4091
02:58:13,240 --> 02:58:14,720
I think this is going to be really big.

4092
02:58:14,900 --> 02:58:15,080
Oh!

4093
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:15,880
No, it's perfect size.

4094
02:58:16,180 --> 02:58:17,060
So tomorrow...

4095
02:58:17,060 --> 02:58:19,080
I will be doing a VR chat stream.

4096
02:58:19,700 --> 02:58:20,140
So...

4097
02:58:20,140 --> 02:58:22,320
I will be hanging out in VR.

4098
02:58:22,460 --> 02:58:24,620
I'll be in full body VR.

4099
02:58:24,840 --> 02:58:26,860
So you can see me wiggle and squiggle.

4100
02:58:28,360 --> 02:58:29,820
And so we'll do that tomorrow.

4101
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:32,360
And then afterwards, we'll be off Kai.

4102
02:58:32,600 --> 02:58:35,280
And then as of Sunday, I'll be heading off to Japan.

4103
02:58:35,740 --> 02:58:37,740
So my schedule will be a little inconsistent.

4104
02:58:37,740 --> 02:58:38,760
From Sunday.

4105
02:58:38,840 --> 02:58:42,380
But I will be still streaming from Japan.

4106
02:58:42,660 --> 02:58:43,520
That is the plan.

4107
02:58:43,720 --> 02:58:45,680
I bought a bunch of stuff for it.

4108
02:58:45,780 --> 02:58:45,960
So...

4109
02:58:46,580 --> 02:58:46,840
Oh!

4110
02:58:46,960 --> 02:58:52,540
And tomorrow, I will be doing a test stream of my laptop.

4111
02:58:52,680 --> 02:58:54,540
And hopefully everything will work out.

4112
02:58:54,680 --> 02:58:55,260
I love you.

4113
02:58:55,280 --> 02:58:56,000
Please never change.

4114
02:58:56,520 --> 02:58:57,360
Thank you.

4115
02:58:57,860 --> 02:58:59,040
Thank you guys so much.

4116
02:58:59,160 --> 02:59:02,260
I will see you tomorrow for a wiggly squiggly time.

4117
02:59:02,720 --> 02:59:03,600
And yeah!

4118
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:04,960
Otsumito!

4119
02:59:05,980 --> 02:59:06,500
Otsubustin.

4120
02:59:06,500 --> 02:59:08,060
Otsu Dark Detective!

4121
02:59:08,700 --> 02:59:09,480
Thank you guys.

4122
02:59:09,660 --> 02:59:10,340
Thank you so much!

4123
02:59:10,380 --> 02:59:11,080
This was so much fun!

4124
02:59:11,340 --> 02:59:11,940
Bye bye.

4125
02:59:12,080 --> 02:59:12,620
Bye bye.

4126
02:59:12,900 --> 02:59:13,560
See you.

4127
02:59:13,560 --> 02:59:13,800
Bye!
