00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,700
Hello!

2
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,860
Sorry, I took so long.

3
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,220
Sorry.

4
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,020
I'm sorry.

5
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,600
Hello, everybody.

6
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,140
Welcome to...

7
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,180
Duck detective.

8
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,300
Duck detective.

9
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,880
Duck detective.

10
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,120
Duck detective.

11
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,160
I'm watching while on the toilet.

12
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,280
Don't tell my boss, Tihi.

13
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,660
is safe with me.

14
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,360
What the duck is going on?

15
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,600
There's all sorts of ducking and going on in here.

16
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,160
We're solving a quacking case today, everybody.

17
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,440
What the quack?

18
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,880
What the quack?

19
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,680
Detective Min solves the case of the crying wisp.

20
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,680
There's no solving that one.

21
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,270
Yes.

22
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:46,370
Actually, I saw this game on Twitter, and I was like, oh my
gosh, I love Detective Game.

23
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,290
Oh, heyo, gozaiyama.

24
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,450
Oh, heyo, gozaiyama.

25
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,490
I saw this game on Twitter, and I thought it looked really
cute.

26
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:03,610
And actually, this is not a sponsored stream or anything,
but they reached out to me, and they gave me a key for it.

27
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,150
So, thank you!

28
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,550
Happy Broccoli!

29
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,490
Thank you for the key!

30
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,570
Thank you.

31
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,950
Pilled!

32
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,650
Welcome to my booshah!

33
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,370
Thank you!

34
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,170
So, um...

35
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,730
Yeah, but, uh...

36
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,870
I was, uh, I was, like, wondering when I would play it.

37
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,150
Um, but, um, recently my throat has been, like, pretty bad.

38
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:33,690
So, um, I believe this game is, uh, voice acted from what
I've seen, so I think...

39
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,430
I'll be able to mostly just sit back and relax.

40
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,590
I think.

41
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,650
I think.

42
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,350
I saw this recently on Steam.

43
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,310
It was tempted to Supa asking you to play it.

44
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,030
Well, here we are.

45
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:51,870
Here we are, baby.

46
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,090
Thank you.

47
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,730

00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,690

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,340

This so far isn't so bad, but well, just in case.

66
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,500
If we can adjust anything that we need to.

67
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,400
If we need to.

couple hours, I have a meeting which I'm very excited for

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,960
More information provided when incorrect.

81
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,020

82
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,740
I was once a detective.

83
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,600

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,220
Not able to pay next month the rent.

Oh, no.

96
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,940
My brain felt foggy.

97
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,660
And I was trying to remember.

98
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,060
Where did all my money go?

99
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,640

00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,120

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,600

Okay, that should be better.

113
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,620
Sorry, I'm going to be adjusting the audio a little bit.

114
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,920

127
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,640

00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,360
He sighs.

140
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,100
I took that photo of her in a secluded tulip field.

141
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,220
Wow, she's kind of hot.

142
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,140
Look at that long neck of hers.

143
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,420
We spoke for hours under the stars that night.

144
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,120
Oh, my God.

145
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,180

meteor And how like they're so like blue and beautiful and

00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:24,100
They're so cute And now and now she doesn't even answer my
texts.

149
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,720
Oh my goodness.

150
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,240
Don't don't be I mean you guys are divorced Get a grip man

Oh You haven't even cleaned up the papers on your floor.

153
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,500
There's loaves on the floor.

154
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,960
This is wasteful.

155
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,820
This is wasteful Wasteful I won't be needing this badge
anymore.

156
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:48,800

something's going on with that bread in him.

158
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,980
Doesn't it say police?

159
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,560
My new job as the duck detective isn't going any better
though.

160
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:08,080
So he quit the force to become a detective well if things

For the duck detective.

165
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,670
Not my proudest moment.

166
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,890
Oh my god, he's addicted to the bread, the spongy loaf.

167
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,010
Divorces like algebra.

168
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,050
You look at your ex and wonder why.

169
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,730
But the toast helps me to forget.

170
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,550
No, you got it.

171
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,850

Mushy, Mushy.

175
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,240
I'm a different duck now.

176
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,300
Anna, take him back.

177
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,920
I haven't had a slice of bread in weeks.

178
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,780
I don't believe that.

179
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,920
I don't believe that at all, Detective.

180
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,720
You have to believe me!

181
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,500
Oh my God, he's so loud.

182
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
He's toasted.

183
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,980
You have you speaking to the duck detective.

184
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:33,920
The duck detective?

185
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,120
Why does he sometimes sound like Bo-Joy?

186
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:48,600
Jack let's discuss this in person now be there in an hour

rundown call center.

189
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,940
Oh, I don't think you have any room to talk, mister.

190
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,860
I better crack this case or I won't even have enough money
to make it back home.

191
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,060
I'll come back.

192
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:17,900
Thank you.

193
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Alright, let's see what else we got in here.

194
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,520
Oh, woo!

195
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,400
Oh, there's a koala over there.

196
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:26,760
Wait, what?

197
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,720
I'm just knocking everything.

198
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,440
I'm a menace.

199
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,160
I'm a menace!

200
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,380
Yeah!

201
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:30,940
Litter!

202
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:31,600
Yeah!

203
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,180
Who are you?

204
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,180
I'm staying here until I get my money back.

205
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,220
Oh, no.

206
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,380
So I found him with a hard loaf.

207
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,760
Bear bus?

208
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,900
Huh, more like scam bus.

209
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,660
Ooh, scam bus.

210
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,420
Ask for details.

211
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,680
You, uh, sound unhappy.

212
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,600
You bet I am.

213
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,820
Their stupid buses always arrive late.

214
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,780
The murder victim was the dodo, and they have already won.

215
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,420
Stop, no.

216
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,460
I came back from a work trip to the West and arrived here at
three of them.

217
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,340
Oh my god.

218
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,340
They don't even want to give me a refund.

219
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,000
How much did you pay?

220
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,040
Yeah, how much?

221
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,320
Um, yeah.

222
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,600
Too smart.

223
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,900
Smark?

224
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,100
That's not the point.

225
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,420
Oh.

226
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,180
Where did all my money go to Supertest?

227
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,160
Oh, thank you.

228
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,300
Don, thank you, Rico.

229
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:26,760
Thank you.

230
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,940
It's about the principle.

231
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,880
So true.

232
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,460
That is true.

233
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,400
It's the principle of it all, right?

234
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,060
What's over here?

235
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,600
Any evidence in the leaves?

236
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:37,760
Nope.

237
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,920
I think we're good.

238
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,140
He was going to go to therapy, but the therapist was a
quack!

239
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,540
What's over here?

240
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,060
Some- oh, a sign.

241
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,880
New bus routes starting in August.

242
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,400
Visit the scenic mountains of Salsichia.

243
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,020
Salsichia?

244
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,380
I'd always tell Anna we'd go there one day.

245
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,000
No, you have to stop thinking about her.

246
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,020
You know what?

247
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
At least she's alive.

248
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,180
Usually in these games, they're dead, right?

249
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,860
Okay, let's go inside.

250
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,900
Sao sitcha.

251
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,420
Bear butt.

252
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:16,780
Oh, wait.

253
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,080
What's in here?

254
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,480
This office looks like it'll worsen my depression.

255
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,200
Waiting for the bus in the rain.

256
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,480
In the rain bus, wait for...

257
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,660
Can I trade in my 500 mint coin for schmarks?

258
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,400
No!

259
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,040
Mint coin is priceless.

260
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:44,780
the highest price what are you talking about one one mint
coin is equal to probably 500 million quadrillion bajillion

261
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:53,700

274
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,230
That's like the most important part, Detective.

275
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,370
Listen, buddy.

276
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,470
Buddy.

277
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,350
You better get out of here, or I'll have to call security.

278
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,230
There's always more to people than you might think.

279
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,850
Hey, Detective, where's your pipe?

280
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,410
Paige, what are you talking about?

281
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,090
I gave up the pipe long ago.

282
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,250
the half pipe, the round pipe.

283
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,550
What?

284
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,190
Daniel!

Thank you for that, Akasuba!

286
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,030
So it's a very stressful couple of days I work for Minstream
Heals.

287
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,570
My mind has been boisterous, so thank you!

288
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,790
I should take a closer look and figure out what she's about.

289
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,170
Okay, hold on.

290
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,430

There we go.

00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,590
Okay, I think that's... We'll just keep it all at the same
levels, right?

293
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,750
Inspection.

294
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,950
Use the magnifying glass to find clues and press E to
uncover them.

295
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,970
Oh, we got a name here.

296
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,090
Name tag.

297
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,270
Last name.

298
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,430
Winthimer.

299
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:26,610
Oops.

Oh, wow.

304
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,230
Suddenly they grow.

305
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,630
Ew, they grew.

306
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:35,850
Toes.

307
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,710
It's so gross.

308
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,210
Oh.

309
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:39,490

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,150
Boy band.

311
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,150
Oh, K-pop.

312
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,530
K-pop fan.

313
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,970
Oh, she grows.

314
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,310
Ew, she grows fingers.

315
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,710
Oh, God.

316
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,270
Oh, she's been crying.

317
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:50,870
Tear.

318
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,410
Sad.

319
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:52,370
Oh, no.

320
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,670
Her favorite boy, Ben.

321
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,370
Her favorite, her, oh, she just announced graduation
probably.

322
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,470
Nose.

323
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,190
Nostral.

324
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,810
Oh, it's so...

325
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,710
Oh, oh, oh.

326
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,410
This is so weird.

327
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,610
I like it, though.

328
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,010
Oh.

329
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,270
Oh wait, I pressed the wrong thing, my bad.

Just saying.

359
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,490
Sophie, first name.

360
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,650

Handwriting be wild and right?

367
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,820
I think this detective might be a quack.

368
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,040
F-F.

369
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,020
Oh, customer service!

370
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,880

Ah, that's why she's making such a face.

377
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,140
I should try and cheer her up.

378
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,640
She's watching K-pop to make herself feel better.

379
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,920
You're still here?

380
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,580
Sophie, what if I just tell her your first and last name?

381
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,280
Good observation, Sophie, Windheimer.

No, we're not trying to risk, Sophie.

393
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,560
Anyway, that was really nice of you.

394
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,420
No one else remembered.

395
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,360
Can you believe it?

396
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,220
Remembered.

397
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,460
If you know my birthday, you must have a connection to
someone here.

398
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,440
Here's the keycard to the office.

399
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,460
Oh, that's it?

400
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,280

Oh, okay.

406
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,060

Here we go.

408
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,420
See you later, Sophie.

409
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,800
And by the time I leave, there won't be a dry eye in this
whole building.

410
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,320
But not because you're sad that nobody remembered your
birthday, but because you'll miss me.

411
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:10,600
A stained carpets and peeling wallpaper exuded a stench of
stale coffee in abandoned dreams.

412
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,840
I knew I couldn't stay long or rub off on it.

413
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,400
Happy birthday, Sophie.

414
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,360

00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,000
This is the last straw!

417
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,460
How do they do that with their...

418
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,080
How do they do?

419
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,540
How do they do?

420
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,700
How do they do?

421
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,840
How do they do that with their mouth?

422
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,240
Frederson needs to be fired!

423
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,680

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,800

433
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,900
A client hired me to investigate a case.

434
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,720
Why didn't you just say so?

435
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,280

I hastily wrote this before heading to the client's address.

447
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,080
So I guess it has some stuff that, uh, is important.

448
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,380

I got a achievement.

508
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,990
Complete five inspections.

509
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,410
The kitchen.

510
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,570
In here must be the crime scene.

511
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,870

No, this is Freddy after he got the divorce.

515
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,790

00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:03,970
Just the twins?

530
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:05,530
Oh!

531
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,650
A secret.

532
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,750
Hinge!

533
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,290
The safest behind there.

534
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,230
Framed.

535
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,170
High quality.

536
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:22,610
Is it normal to have a huge painting of your family in your
office?

537
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:23,570
I think so.

538
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,420
Secret secrets.

539
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
We have secrets in here.

540
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,200
Number one, dad.

541
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,860
We'll talk to him in a second.

542
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,280
Oh, it's the R.

543
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,440
What a fancy nameplate.

544
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,560
This guy is...

545
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,080
He says Ernst.

546
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,960
Oh, Ernst.

547
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,140
So we gotta...

548
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,020
I gotta remember to start writing people's names down in
here, right?

549
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,000
Oh, we don't know his first name yet.

550
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,740
It might be Freddy.

551
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,920
Because he is a bear.

552
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:58,940
No.

553
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,480
Freddy's last name was different.

554
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,780
Ayrst.

555
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,700
Let's observe you.

556
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,300
Oh.

557
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,280
Angry brow.

558
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:09,840
Stir.

559
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,540
Okay.

560
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,280
Your ears are clean.

561
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,260
Oh my goodness.

562
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,520
He's buff.

563
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,740
Tie.

564
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,780
Expensive.

565
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,000
Branch manager.

566
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:22,760
Ayrst.

567
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,680
Oh my god.

568
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,560
Look at these arms beef.

569
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,480
Ew!

570
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,620
Stain, baby food, family man.

571
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,420
Nothing in your pants.

572
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,960
Your fancy little shoes.

573
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:35,540
Okay.

574
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,240
Alright, I guess we'll start talking with him.

575
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,500
How are the detective things?

576
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,120
Donald, things are the five gifted things.

577
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,520
It's Mr. McQuacklin.

578
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,220
Mr. McQuacklin, please, sir.

579
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:47,820
Right.

580
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,160
Apologies.

581
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,300
Well.

582
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,560
Right.

583
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,460
Added to clues.

584
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,080
Why?

585
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,820
Are you planning on staying in my office much longer?

586
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,280
Oh, why are you doing secret things in here?

587
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,740
I'll have to inspect the entire premise to do my job
correctly.

588
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,080
Well, hurry up.

589
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:05,900
Mm-hmm.

591
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,820
Oh, question.

592
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,720
Was it you who called me?

593
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:11,760
No.

594
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,720
I never heard of you before.

595
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,360
That's unusual.

596
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,020
It's good you're here, since there has been some...

597
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,380
Unrest, you say.

598
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,840
Well, I'll see myself out, Mr. Ernst.

599
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,120
Ernst.

600
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,180
Hmm.

601
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,220
Suspicious.

602
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:35,820
Yeah.

00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,860

606
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,840

00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,520
West currency.

630
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,800
What else we got here?

631
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,600
Salami?

632
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,080
High quality.

633
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,520
Mmm.

634
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,020

00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:51,500

00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,620
Spotless.

637
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,480
Good condition.

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,160

639
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,920
Let a man have his own amount of salami.

640
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,080
Who's to you to say how much is a lot of salami?

641
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:07,780
Okay.

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
Custom mug.

645
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,820
Wait, are those glasses?

646
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,340
Thick glasses, strong prescription.

647
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,340
Bad eyesight.

648
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,140
Oh my gosh.

00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,400

Do you have any idea who picked me to investigate?

662
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:58,790
Why are you not?

663
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,370
No idea, but I'm so happy you're here.

664
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:02,990
I don't think, I don't believe that.

665
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,670
I think I sense a little tension.

666
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,210
I have a copy of your book.

667
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,590
The early bird catches the criminal.

668
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,670
Oh, he's a fan!

669
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,590
I'm not signing anything, though.

670
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:12,590
Can you sign it?

671
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:13,970
No.

672
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:15,830
Maybe.

673
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,070
Later.

674
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,030
The fact it was a prompt.

675
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,270
Oh, okay.

676
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,450
I'll just keep the copy right here.

677
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,470
I'll just keep the copy right here.

678
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:30,990
So you could sign it.

679
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:31,650
Later.

680
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:32,250
Later.

681
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:32,910
Yeah, later.

682
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,290
Yeah.

683
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:41,570
So, I guess now we head to the kitchen.

684
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,910
But he has a cup name, but that's written Laura.

685
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,230
I don't know, is that your cup?

686
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,830
In here must be the crime scene.

687
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,170
First, I want to find out who the people in the office are.

688
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:59,410
When you said your shoes became slip-ons, I was thinking
they were regular shoes, but slowly became slip-ons because

689
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:00,710
your feet were shrinking.

690
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,190
It will make things easier.

691
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,290
I'll need to remember to write everything down.

692
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:04,790
Oh, okay.

693
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,010
Let's write everything down.

694
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,870
First, what's, uh, not Freddy.

695
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,130
Um, what was it?

696
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:13,490
Hold on.

697
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,620
For Rufus, Rufus.

698
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,580
And then, Freddy sucks.

699
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,280
Um.

700
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,780
I'm so bad with names.

701
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,400
Oh my goodness.

702
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:31,980
Okay.

703
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,260
Um, Gator is forever rejected.

704
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,880
Um, oh yes, it was Manfred, right?

705
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:57,860
probably you are you Laura and you're Rufus no wrong wrong
oh just kidding oh wait oh wait it was Freddy wasn't it oh

706
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:10,720

to take it out the bear is man Oh!

707
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,860
Oh, Freddy's a nickname!

708
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,280
Wait, how did he get employee of the month then?

709
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,240
That's kind of icky.

710
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,320
He's the branch manager.

711
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,140
This doesn't make much sense.

712
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,960
So, Rufus, what was the last name, though?

713
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,660
Was it Pet...

714
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,080
No.

715
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,020
Oh, gosh.

716
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,120
Whitlock was the girl...

717
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,300
Was that the sexy lamb?

718
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,720
Who's angst?

719
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:44,680
Hold on.

720
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,760
I gotta go back and look.

721
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:46,600
Check stuff out.

722
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,120
This is...

723
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,680
Yeah, Whitlock is this lady.

724
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:52,540
Hmm.

725
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,780
I can't tell if this is Laura or not.

726
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,960
What if this is Laura?

727
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,580
Where are you anyway?

728
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:02,580
Hmm.

729
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,260
I shouldn't go out.

730
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,260
I need to find out.

731
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,280
I remember to write.

732
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:06,600
Okay.

733
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,700
Rufus, Citrus?

734
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,960
I thought it was Freddy, Citrus.

735
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,220
Guys, I'm really bad with names.

736
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:20,640
Please forgive me.

737
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,500
Oh, it is Rufus.

738
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,160
You're so right.

739
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:22,700
Okay.

740
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,320
But didn't we try that?

741
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,380
Yeah, it wasn't him.

742
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,620
Are you Laura?

743
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,780
But we don't know Laura's last name, do we?

744
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,120
What other things do we have?

745
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,600
Laura from...

746
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,220
Customer service is way too loud.

747
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,140
We got Sophie.

748
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,140
Bag of salami.

749
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,620
Oh, I can just go here.

750
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:08,340
It says there's a photo here, so, and this kind of looks
like a duck by my very, very astute deductions.

751
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,520
Imagine the aroma of into gaming chair.

752
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,980
Bob, Bob, you didn't need to type that.

753
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,580
You didn't need to.

754
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,100
You didn't need to send that.

755
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,140
Oh, oh, no.

756
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,420
You okay?

757
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,120
What was this one?

758
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,020
It's a list of all the bus drivers.

759
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,340
The bus driver out of all four seems to be Petrovich.

760
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,540
Petrovich is the driver.

761
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,080
Okay.

762
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,540
Let's see.

763
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,200
Let's see.

764
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,000
I don't think Laura has a last name though, right?

765
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,220
What was the angst?

766
00:47:59,620 --> 00:47:59,760
Oh!

767
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:01,780
Just kidding.

768
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,560
When did we learn her last name?

769
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,000
Am I, I don't wanna just like, just guess around everything.

770
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,380
It fits her.

771
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,720
I don't want to guess around everything.

772
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:21,760
Intuition.

773
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,340
Those are the bus stops.

774
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,100
The promotion note.

775
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,200
Oh, yes, you're right.

776
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,520
And then she said that he refuses to give her a promotion.

777
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,030
Maybe if we sign his book, we'll learn.

778
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:50,370
Oh, true.

779
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,050
Promotion to senior customers served.

780
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:55,850
There we go.

781
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:56,690
El angst.

782
00:48:58,550 --> 00:48:59,030
Okay.

783
00:48:59,490 --> 00:48:59,910
Oh, you're right.

784
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:02,730
We probably do have to sign his book so that we can learn
his name.

785
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:03,970
Who do we make it out to?

786
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,730
Alright, let's go talk to him.

787
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:06,910
Ah.

788
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:09,130
Okay.

789
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,610
Oh, hello.

790
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:11,290
Hi.

791
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,750
How are you, Mr. Duck Detective?

792
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:14,690
I'm good.

793
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:15,230
Oh.

794
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:20,050
What do you know about Manfred Arrest?

795
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:20,790
Arrest.

796
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:22,570
I think he likes me.

797
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,750
He's the only one who...

798
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,270
who doesn't shout at me.

799
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,370
Oh, lucky.

800
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:32,270
I'm the only one here in the operating office.

801
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:33,190
Can you imagine?

802
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:35,790
Oh God, no wonder things don't get done.

803
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:39,250
I plan all the bus routes and make sure the buses are on
time.

804
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:40,750
Isn't that so?

805
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,050
Don't you have an anger?

806
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:43,270
I, really?

807
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:46,190
Okay, it was this one though that we, um.

808
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,130
So, you?

809
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,330
Nope, but I, oh no.

810
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,490
Maybe we can't ask about the book.

811
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,890
Oh no, wait, no, that's a slimy.

812
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,410
Maybe we can't ask about the book anymore.

813
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,720
What do you think about Manfred Ernst?

814
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,020
Manfred Ernst.

815
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,200
Oh, he's a great guy.

816
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,260
I just wish I'd finally get a raise.

817
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,200
Oh, Laura.

818
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,040
Yes, sorry.

819
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:09,960
This is Bear Bus.

820
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,860
Your bus will be three hours late.

821
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,460
It's on the desk behind him.

822
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,620
No, I think what I'm seeing...

823
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,900
The little bubble above him, I'm pretty sure is his personal
bubble.

824
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:25,980
You know?

825
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:39,480
three hours late baby let's go how do I how do I autograph

828
00:50:59,180 --> 00:50:59,520
This?

829
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,810
Do you don't you realize you're stupid now?

830
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:20,050
You yelled at me so much, the book is behind him.

831
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:22,470
Do you feel dumb now?

832
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,130
There's no bubble above it!

833
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:29,900
Don't yell at me!

834
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,320
Maybe if you click on it some more.

835
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,830
But have you tried the... That's clearly in the plan.

836
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:48,370
Yeah, it's on the other side of the table in the plant.

837
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:55,870
Hmm.

838
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,150
Well, all we have is Rufus or Freddy?

839
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,970
Fredderson.

840
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,770
Where do we learn that last name from?

841
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,020
Fredderson.

842
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,720
Fredderson.

843
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,000
There's still stuff.

844
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,180
Oh, maybe we can go talk to a reception again.

845
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,360
Freddy Freddersen.

846
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:32,220
Let's ask her opinion on some of these people.

847
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,940
What can you tell me about Laura angst?

848
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,040
Laura needs to chill out.

849
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:37,440
Dang.

850
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,080
I do love her.

851
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,360
But if she keeps living like this, she'll have a heart
attack by 23.

852
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,020
She's not even 22.

853
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,320
Oh boy.

854
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
So, do you have an idea?

855
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,010
who would have hired me?

856
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,240
It's about the incident, isn't it?

857
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,260
The incident?

858
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,120
Um, sorry.

859
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,640
Thank you for the raid!

860
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,470
Wait, hold on.

861
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:02,960

862
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,760

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

884
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,180
We're trying to figure out this dang crocodile's name.

885
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:14,320
But I think I missed a prompt because the game didn't expect
me to be a jerk.

886
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,600
I'm sorry I was a jerk.

887
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,120
Jerk to you, please.

888
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,760
So, you really...

889
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,630
Nope, but I always talk about you, so someone must have
gotten the idea from me.

890
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,620
No, let me sign your book.

891
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,160

00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:46,630
Is that another raid?

898
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:47,310
What is happening?

899
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:48,950

Thank you, guys.

905
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:26,390
Thank you for the words installed.

906
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:28,970
You.

907
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,130
What do you know about Laura Angst?

908
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,490
Oh, she's a fantastic employee.

909
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,070
Yeah, you're gonna give her a raise?

910
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:37,070
She basically does the work of five people.

911
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,210
And she deserves the pay of five people.

912
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:40,430
That's it!

913
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,520
Is that why all the desks are empty?

914
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:49,620
Because...

915
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,920
Because there's no one else?

916
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,500
You guys, I'm not quite sure what to do here.

917
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,420
I mean, you know what?

918
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,400
Detective work isn't easy.

919
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:00,820
Ponder details.

920
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,720
The thing that bothered me in particular was...

921
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,340
Suspects?

922
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:09,060
I couldn't wrap my head around the suspects.

923
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,340
Could you hit Q for me.

924
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,280
Names.

925
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,620
Once I knew someone's name, I had to write it down on the
suspects' page.

926
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,900
Only then could I interrogate suspects about their opinion
of other people.

927
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:30,520
finding out people's names was a whole other task yeah how
am I supposed to get the gator's name often there are clues

928
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:41,320
in the environment that they work in okay be that documents
digital or analog or remarks of their co-workers it won't

929
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:48,600
let me go into this room yet in here must first it will make
things I'll need to remember it won't let me go in here and

930
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,420
it won't let me go in here I shouldn't I need to... Did I
remember to...

931
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,240
Hmm...

932
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,220
Is there anything written here that I missed?

933
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,300
Bear Bus.

934
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,140
No, not his name.

935
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,880
Oh, someone said... What's Q?

936
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,600
I'm scared.

937
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:05,560
What does Q do?

938
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:06,140
Ah!

939
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:14,580
Uh,

940
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:19,370
my bad.

941
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:23,250
She answers a call.

942
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:23,770
This is Bear Bus.

943
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:24,830
How can I help you?

944
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:27,750
Third time you're calling.

945
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:30,450
I'm telling you, your ex-wife did...

946
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:32,530
She looks busy, yeah?

947
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:34,410
Oh.

948
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:36,630
We did this one.

949
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:40,090
I don't know.

950
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,130
This is the bus drivers.

951
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,430
Is there anything in here on the cash payment?

952
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:46,790
Wait!

953
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:51,890
To Mr. Brandenburg.

954
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,770
That must be him, right?

955
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,750
But it wouldn't let me give it as an option.

956
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:59,890
Have I soft-locked my game for real?

957
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:05,930
It's not an option.

958
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:08,790
See here.

959
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:09,070
Oh,

960
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,390
it's a part of Germany.

961
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,310
Oh, just kidding.

962
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:29,390
Suggestion box.

963
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,630
If someone steals my mug again, I'll end them.

964
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:35,770
We have Laura.

965
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:39,370
I'm pretty sure Laura is Laura.

966
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:39,930
Oh, wait.

967
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:40,910
This is Laura.

968
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:41,670

01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,940

976
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,100
Okay, she hates Freddy.

977
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,200
Freddy?

978
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:22,480

Okay, what about you?

01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:30,090
Oh, never mind, you have no opinion.

982
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:33,250
You don't care about him at all.

Laura the Cat works in customer service.

990
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:27,690
The crocodile called Freddy works in operating office.

991
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:30,330
Deck approved, baby.

992
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:35,170
Now that I had worked out these names, I was ready to check
out the crime scene.

993
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,070
The crime scene.

994
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,570
Let's see where that lunch got stolen from.

995
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:42,010
Then I could finally talk to my client.

996
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:47,130
be able to keep track of everyone, what they do and
everything.

997
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:52,230
Average of five duck per square meter?

998
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,710
To cheap white toast entered my nostrils.

999
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:58,330
Oh no, no, no, you can't relapse, Detective.

1000
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:04,470
I knew I had to stay strong.

1001
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:11,410
Our detective is addicted to the white, to the white bread,
not the wheat, not the whole grain.

1002
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,870
The cheap white bread.

1003
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:23,130
this wasn't what I was here for the milk toast just one
crumb no no stop eating the icing oh can't you wait a couple

Not yet.

1009
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,270
Let's observe her, maybe.

1010
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:52,610
Oh, oh, God.

1011
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:55,590
She's catfishing the whole office.

1012
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:57,430
As soon as you...

1013
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:04,690
As soon as you hold a magnifying glass up to her, the truth
is revealed.

1014
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:08,950
Inpeccable hair, well groomed.

1015
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:12,650
Whisk, Baker.

1016
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,010
Motherly.

1017
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:14,810
Aww.

1018
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:17,230
Oh!

1019
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:22,030
Why is everybody divorced in this game?

1020
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:26,230
Why is literally everyone divorced in this game?

1021
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:30,090
Oops, my bad.

1022
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:31,210
Oh.

1023
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:32,890
Halloween party!

1024
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:34,190
Cute.

1025
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:34,870
Cancel.

1026
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:35,710
Oh no.

1027
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:38,050
Budget cuts.

1028
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:39,830
So she's single.

1029
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:43,610
Party.

1030
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,010
Hungry, get your own lunch.

1031
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:48,230
Where did that?

1032
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:49,130
There we go.

1033
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:51,030
Angry note.

1034
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:52,210
Hungry.

1035
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:54,570
Looking for editor unpaid.

1036
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:56,670
And then some...

1037
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,270
I think that's Laura and Sophie.

1038
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,810
Office parties are a bad idea anyway.

1039
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:08,150
They stop doing them at the precinct after the jam incident.

1040
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:11,810
Do tell.

1041
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:13,010
Spill the tea.

1042
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:16,230
Spill the tea.

1043
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:23,430
I doubt they washed their hands after leaving that greasy
handprint.

1044
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:24,530
Eww!

1045
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:27,370
Let's pull what we got in here.

1046
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:29,310
Whatever this is.

1047
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,750
Thanks for the food.

1048
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:32,670
Salami Bandit!

1049
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,210
Hamprint.

1050
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:35,730
Greasy.

1051
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,050
Sharp claws.

1052
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:38,730
RS.

1053
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:41,430
Margaret.

1054
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,230
First name, Margaret.

1055
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,250
Salami Bandit?

1056
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,330
There's a real salami bandit.

1057
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:50,850
A sandwich.

1058
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,850
What else we got here around here?

1059
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:56,670
What am I missing?

1060
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,860
Did I... this?

1061
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:05,340
Oh!

1062
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:06,220
The note.

1063
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:08,820
There we go.

1064
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,060
I thought it was the sharp claws.

1065
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,660
This must be the crime scene.

1066
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,360
This note is curious.

1067
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,260
Let's observe you, sir.

1068
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,340
Whoa, eyebrows.

1069
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:27,180
Oh.

1070
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:28,780
Toes.

1071
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,540
Worker shoes.

1072
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:30,780
Practical person.

1073
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,080
Okay.

1074
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,380
He's got his little toolbox.

1075
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,460
He's the janitor.

1076
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,380
Well, you're not...

1077
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:36,880
I'm sorry.

1078
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,080
I'm really sorry, actually.

1079
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,940
You have a lot of work ahead of you, mister.

1080
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:42,720
Oh, it's my fault.

1081
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,740
I'm really sorry.

1082
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:44,520
Sorry.

1083
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:47,320
Sticker.

1084
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,100
Sci-fi fan.

1085
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:49,880
Oh, interesting.

1086
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,380
He's a nerd.

1087
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,780
All right, let's talk to Margaret first.

1088
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:56,580
Yes, dear.

1089
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,240
I'm Eugene McQuacklin.

1090
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,400
And I need to ask some questions.

1091
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:02,700
A detective?

1092
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,560
How exciting.

1093
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,100
Everyone hide their salami.

1094
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,780
What's the most gruesome murder you've seen?

1095
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,220
Oh, no.

1096
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,760
She's into true crime podcasts.

1097
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,880
How many dead bodies have you encountered?

1098
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:19,360

here who could have hired me?

1108
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:52,280
To be honest, everyone was quite shocked by the launch
theft.

1109
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,280
And no one told me they've called a detective.

1110
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,860
I don't know what's going on at all.

1111
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,060
Okay, calm down, Margaret.

1112
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:00,740
Sheesh.

1113
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:02,160
Okay, you're all right.

1114
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,120
Let's add her.

1115
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,420
Margaret with luck.

1116
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,400
To the list.

1117
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,060
And about you, sir.

1118
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,680
This was just broken again.

1119
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,740
broken again.

1120
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:14,400
Where are we?

1121
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:15,380
Where do we live?

1122
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,380
What's wrong with these youngsters?

1123
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,040
Don't know how to treat things with respect.

1124
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,880
With respect.

1125
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,180
Why would they put the mugs in face up?

1126
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:26,460
Okay, that's really devilish, actually.

1127
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,300
That is so evil.

1128
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:30,880
Okay.

1129
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,420
What do you think of Margaret?

1130
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:35,420
What do you think of Margaret?

1131
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:37,840
What is your relationship with Margaret Whitlock?

1132
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:38,420
Yeah.

1133
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,240
She's a true sweetheart.

1134
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:49,060
We have our weekly Mahjong evenings Mahjong evenings

Arrinsed He's a stubborn one Hmm I do respect that.

1138
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:29,090
Would you say you enjoy Freddie Ferderson's company?

1139
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:31,650
Does anybody enjoy Freddie Ferderson's company?

1140
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:32,050
Huh?

1141
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:38,690
If anyone needs to learn to respect their elders, it's that
moron.

1142
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:39,930
It's over for me.

1143
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,930
Oh, he doesn't like him.

1144
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:44,250
Okay.

1145
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:45,670
I'm a private detective.

1146
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:47,830
And I'm here to investigate.

1147
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:48,610
Who hired us?

1148
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:49,990
Is that so?

1149
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:51,650
Is that so?

1150
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:53,430
I need to find my client.

1151
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,410
Do you know who it could be?

1152
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:56,770
Why is there nobody who...

1153
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:58,690
Yeah, Freddy's a bit of a weird one.

1154
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,490
So I'd imagine you were called, Detective.

1155
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:00,990
What?

1156
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:04,430
Personally, I feel we're doing just fine.

1157
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:08,250
I don't need no messing about our business around here.

1158
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,250
Okay, suspicious, sir.

1159
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:15,830
Why wouldn't you want a detective to solve the mystery lunch
disappearance, huh?

1160
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:19,890
Interesting, interesting, interesting.

1161
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:22,050
Let's see.

1162
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:25,210
So, are you Rufus?

1163
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,710
He's our employee of the month.

1164
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:30,930
The janitor.

1165
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:32,390
And then we have one more character.

1166
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:33,990
This must be the person that hired us.

1167
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:36,110
Where else can we go?

1168
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:41,730
I guess we can ask other people about these characters.

1169
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:44,590
Such as...

1170
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:45,270
Freddy!

1171
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,710
What do you think of Margaret?

1172
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:50,370
What can you tell me about Margaret?

1173
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:51,250
Margaret Whitlock.

1174
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:55,910
She gets really angry with me when I don't return mugs to
the kitchen.

1175
01:10:57,770 --> 01:11:00,090
Yeah, you have four right there and one in your hand.

1176
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:03,050
Why don't you just return them?

1177
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:03,630
Yeah.

1178
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:04,770
I do.

1179
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:08,470
Just not every day.

1180
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:10,690
This guy is so gross.

1181
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:13,310
There's bananas.

1182
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:15,690
Why don't you just pick up your stuff?

1183
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:18,490
Me?

1184
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:19,350
No.

1185
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:20,310
Don't be messy.

1186
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:33,310

1191
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:13,910
Rufus.

1192
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:15,730
What is Rufus Cedaris like?

1193
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:16,690
Cedaris.

1194
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:19,770
Not the greatest janitor.

1195
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:21,090
Then how did he get...

1196
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:23,270
Then how did he get employee of the month, huh?

1197
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:25,050
He came with the building.

1198
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:25,530
Oh.

1199
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:27,550
That's it?

1200
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:30,210
Okay.

1201
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:34,950
Poor Laura is so underappreciated at this place.

1202
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:37,410
Are you okay, Laura?

1203
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:39,010
Do you need a second?

1204
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:42,490
So the password hint was...

1205
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:44,840
Me and sexy aliens, which...

1206
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:50,150
Still, look at this.

1207
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:56,340
This is like when grandma discovers filters, Snapchat
filters and stuff.

1208
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,260
Me and sexy aliens.

1209
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:09,680
I'm so...

1210
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:14,380
The PC is on, but the person who works at this desk seems to
be on a break.

1211
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,100
Margaret got some dubious...

1212
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,440
Activities?

1213
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,360
Yeah, someone did like sci-fi.

1214
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,440
They only have a single person answering the hotline right
now.

1215
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,180
That's crazy.

1216
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:24,580
Yeah.

1217
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,280
Surprise.

1218
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:26,960
Let's see.

1219
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:27,700
What do we have here?

1220
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:29,120
The client.

1221
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,300
Blank hired the duck detective because his, her blank, was
blank.

1222
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,800
The lunch was stolen by a coworker known as the Salami
Bandit.

1223
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:42,960
We know that a little bit.

1224
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:44,740
More suspects.

1225
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:46,340
Oh, Margaret.

1226
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:51,060
is the sheep who works in customer service.

1227
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:55,500
Penguin is the salami bandit.

1228
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:57,880
Rufus works as the janitor.

1229
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:58,700
Buffalo.

1230
01:13:59,140 --> 01:13:59,920
Okay, let's go outside.

1231
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,200
Maybe we'll find him out there.

1232
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:04,740
Here we go.

1233
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:10,320
Yeah, I knew that the penguin is a Star Trek fan, so...

1234
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:10,920
Oh, there he is.

1235
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,160
So he'll probably have the answer.

1236
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,420
Ruffled my feathers.

1237
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:22,160
I wondered what kind of sorry soul was standing all alone in
the rain.

1238
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,560
I need the soundtrack for this game.

1239
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:24,960
It's so good.

1240
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:25,400
I'm sorry.

1241
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:26,940
What else?

1242
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:27,900
Is anything over here?

1243
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:28,380
No.

1244
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:30,860
What's this note?

1245
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,260
How mysterious.

1246
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:33,880
I want to read it.

1247
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,160
Why are there post-it notes everywhere?

1248
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,040
What's this?

1249
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,220
Someone left their bag here.

1250
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:40,780
Ugh.

1251
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,300
It's full of dirty chim clothes.

1252
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:44,180
No.

1253
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:46,920
Nice.

1254
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:48,360
Double bag.

01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:48,740
Get.

1256
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:51,380
For my own personal collection, of course.

1257
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:53,520
Let's see.

1258
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:53,760
Oh.

1259
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:56,660

1260
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:56,920
Oh.

1261
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,440
Well-proportioned nose.

1262
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,440
Handsome.

1263
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:01,920
Look at the top of his head.

1264
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,740
So neat and clean.

1265
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:05,400
Oh.

1266
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:07,740
Hands and pockets.

1267
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:08,920
Bad manners.

1268
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:09,140
What?

1269
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,020
That's bad manners?

1270
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:11,700
Is it really?

1271
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:14,160
Hands and pockets are...

1272
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:14,540
Oh.

1273
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:15,500
Boris!

1274
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:16,500
Embroidery.

1275
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,320
First name.

1276
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,200
Boars.

1277
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,140
New character.

1278
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:20,820
Let's go.

1279
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,120
Everybody's got an accent.

1280
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:31,280
I'm not here to take a bus.

1281
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,640
Yeah, I'm a detective.

1282
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:36,260
It's cold out.

1283
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:39,900
But if I go inside, I have to face Sophie.

1284
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,160
Is that your ex?

1285
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,480
What's your relationship?

1286
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,280
What do you think of Sophie Windheimer?

1287
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:46,920
Yeah.

1288
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,960
He saws.

1289
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,480
Man, I wish she'd let me talk to her.

1290
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,100
What does that mean?

1291
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:59,580
Do you like Freddy Fredderson?

1292
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,200
It's rude in certain situations.

1293
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,560
He's a pretty funny dude.

1294
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:05,920
He's a pretty funny dude.

1295
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,220
Loves to rant about detective novels.

1296
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:08,900
Okay.

1297
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,500
What do you know about Rufus Cedaris?

1298
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,400
I don't think he likes me very much, to be honest.

1299
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:24,380
doesn't feel like he likes anyone at this office you're rude

01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:49,540

01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,780
Bore, so what, you're a bus driver?

Riti!

1311
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:22,000
He's reaching all over the place.

And others appeared.

1315
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,540
Very suspicious.

1316
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:32,740
Very suspicious.

1317
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,300
What are you even talking about?

1318
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,360
Is this your bag?

1319
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:39,620
No.

1320
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,980
Everyone here has been really unhelpful.

1321
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,200
It's true.

1322
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,640
Why is everybody so overwhelmed?

1323
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,280
Like, nobody's giving, like, a good answer, like, a solid
answer.

1324
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:50,960
Hey, man.

1325
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:52,280
This isn't, you'll have to...

1326
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:52,420
What?

1327
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,280
I'm not here to...

1328
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:58,040
Okay, so typically they each have, like, a, um, what's the
word?

1329
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,660
A, uh, two dialogue.

1330
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,280
So he is our main bus driver, Boris Petrovich.

1331
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:07,280
Petrovich.

1332
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:08,900
Ducks in a row.

1333
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,380
Fill out all suspects' names.

1334
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,100

1335
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,560

1336
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,560
Oh, um, more suspects.

1337
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:26,720
Boris is the buffalo is a bus driver Awesome Now that I had
everyone's name and job It would be easier to figure out

able to talk to That could tell us if they hired us Is Laura

01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,360
Yes, let me walk you through the booking process.

1345
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:33,640
It was time that I found out what happened with the lunch
theft and what they were planning in the kitchen.

1346
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:34,620
In the kitchen.

1347
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:39,160
Blank is planning a blank, blank, blank for blank.

1348
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:49,040
Margaret is planning a surprise birthday party for...

1349
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:50,460
Sophie.

1350
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:59,720
Was planning a surprise birthday party for Sophie.

1351
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:02,480
I see.

1352
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,440
They didn't actually forget her birthday.

1353
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,720
Elementary, my dear wisp.

1354
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,500
How did you know?

1355
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:16,060
I'm telling you.

1356
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,300
I'm a duck detective.

1357
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,180
Oh yeah, there's other stuff here too.

1358
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:28,700
Let's see.

1359
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:29,880
The culprit.

1360
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:33,520
Blank is being blank by blank because blank picked up the
blank blank.

1361
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:41,720
So and so is being framed by blank because blank picked up
the blank blank.

1362
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,240
The wrong mug.

1363
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:47,480
I wonder.

1364
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:49,040
I wonder if...

1365
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:54,340
Freddy is being framed by someone because...

1366
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:55,280
Wait, hmm.

1367
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,280
We still don't know this one quite yet.

1368
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:00,600
We still don't know this one quite yet.

1369
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:07,200
I need to get into her computer so I can see any evidence
she has in her emails.

1370
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:11,540
Nice size.

1371
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:12,380

1373
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,420
Let's see.

1374
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,040
Okay.

1375
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:20,820
Do you know whose bag this is?

1376
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:22,360
Isn't that?

1377
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:23,820

1378
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,900

1379
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,580
So it was swapped out.

1380
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,140
He has the bag.

1381
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:31,240
His bag is actually the bag with the...

1382
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,040
With the gym clothes.

1383
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,060
But they swapped it out.

1384
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,380
Do you know anything about this bag?

1385
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,080
Why are you going around pushing bags into people's faces?

1386
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,060
What's that awful smell?

1387

Yo, Freddy goes hard.

1400
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,380
Freddy's a bit of an adrenaline junkie.

1401
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:12,880
What kind of a person is Boris Petrovich?

1402
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,800
Oh, I don't know what I saw in him.

1403

01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:18,960

1415
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:39,340
We still don't know what's behind is, uh, this, you know.

1416
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:42,240
What are you doing with my family's portrait?

1417
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:43,560
Sorry.

1418
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:49,640
It's just admiring your lovely, your lovely life, you know?

1419
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:55,900
Just admiring your lovely wife.

1420
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:01,760
are they only have that surprising how do i get in

1421
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:09,360
accessible maybe we don't access it maybe

1422
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:23,640
maybe maybe someone else accessed it because they knew the
hint aka our little penguin friend over here maybe he got

1423
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:28,460
onto her computer to do something with the note.

1424
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:29,640
Salami.

1425
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,980
And it's the sharp claws that makes me think that they're
framing Freddy, you know?

1426
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:38,640
Well, I mean, they are framing Freddy because they gave him
the salami.

1427
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,440
So...

1428
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:42,900
Wait a minute.

1429
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,120
It already wants me to...

1430
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:44,300
Okay.

1431
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:47,780
It already...

1432
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,440
It already wants me to solve it.

1433
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,400
Oh, okay.

1434
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:53,740
Freddy is being framed by...

1435
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:56,740
Um...

1436
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,260
Um...

1437
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:58,140
Uh,

1438
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,700
by Laurel?

1439
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:08,840
Because Freddie, two or fewer things are wrong.

1440
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:22,910
You have all the information, just think back.

1441
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:31,790
Think mug equals lunch.

1442
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:36,110
No, well he had the...

1443
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:39,870
She was so mad about him grabbing her mug all the time,
right?

1444
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:42,830
Mug, not bag.

1445
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:47,570
No, I don't think it was the wrong bag, right?

1446
01:26:50,650 --> 01:26:51,610
Or is it the wrong?

1447
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:52,190
Okay, wait.

1448
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,600
It's so clean.

1449
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,840
Who you know who else was clean?

1450
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:15,840
Margaret!

1451
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:17,760
She was also clean.

1452
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:18,880
And divorced!

1453
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:21,120
Hmm.

1454
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:23,700
Hmm.

1455
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:29,010
Yeah, his gym bag or his dirty clothes are...

1456
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:31,170
Yeah, so Freddy picked up the wrong bag.

1457
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:48,280
I love how Bear Bus...

1458
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,400
He's just being framed by Bear Bus.

1459
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,820
Everybody's out to get him.

1460
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,500
Everybody hates Freddy!

1461
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,880
Everybody wants Freddy out of here!

1462
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:06,060
No...

1463
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:12,440
Why am I blanking out on this so much?

1464
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:13,900
Okay, hold on.

1465
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,940
I think maybe because I'm...

1466
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,580
Okay, there's Margaret's sandwich.

1467
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,860
Why is it wide open like that?

1468
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:29,940
RS is the janitor.

1469
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:33,680
What's that sound?

1470
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:37,460
And then...

1471
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:39,240
This is...

1472
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,880
This is...

1473
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:44,580
Oh,

1474
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:50,740
they're brewing coffee.

1475
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,960
Oh, I hear it.

1476
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:53,860
Yeah, you're right.

1477
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:57,250
Why am I blanking so much with this?

1478
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:05,010
So maybe Freddy is being framed by...

1479
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:09,870
Um...

1480
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:11,370
It wouldn't be manfred, right?

1481
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:17,370
But would it be...

1482
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:18,470
Not the wrong bat.

1483
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:21,530
They...

1484
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:21,670
They...

1485
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,050
Use your brain mint.

1486
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:28,810
I have no brain cells right now.

1487
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:31,930
Just look through the names.

1488
01:29:38,890 --> 01:29:39,950
I don't think it's Boris.

1489
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:41,070
Is it Rufus?

1490
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:46,860
Email bag X.

1491
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,100
I mean, he picked up the wrong X.

1492
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:52,460
Ah!

1493
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:01,850
Unless it's Manfred's lunch.

1494
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:03,250
It's available.

1495
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:18,670
the game is like uh by the way um this is so wrong just
please give up okay i think i think it is the bag then

1496
01:30:27,610 --> 01:30:34,150
time for what happens if i do oh it doesn't change anything
we're fine

1497
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:49,520
why bag you were what you were about you were were you're so
you're hired to solve the missing lunch then what does the

1498
01:30:49,520 --> 01:31:01,560
bag have to do with it I think they just switched out the
bags right so Freddy is being framed by it's a Margaret you

1499
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:06,480
evil conniving sheep what

1500
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:20,260
do you carry lunches in a bag or your hands I don't know why
am I Why can't I figure this out?

1501
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:22,900
Am I stupid?

1502
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,140
Think about the lunch was stolen by who?

1503
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:30,720
Well, I don't know.

1504
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:32,440
Who would have won it?

1505
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:37,840
Because each person in here he has his own lunch.

1506
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:39,460
Margaret has her own lunch.

1507
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:41,580
This is...

1508
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,760
Well, I'm assuming it's Laura's lunch.

1509
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:49,060
I'm assuming it's Laura's lunch, but what if it's not?

1510
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:59,130
Try looking through all the names, nouns, and choices.

1511
01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:03,030
Suspicious.

1512
01:32:05,790 --> 01:32:07,670
I think it's framed.

1513
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:13,580
By...

1514
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:15,200
The Salami Bandit.

1515
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:19,740
Oh wait.

1516
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,200
Oh, Freddy!

1517
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,200
Freddy by Freddy!

1518
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:41,380
Freddy is being framed by Freddy because Freddy picked up
the wrong one.

1519
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:53,170
And who didn't like who, right?

1520
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,010
Bad manners.

1521
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:58,030
Maybe Boris ate the lunch.

1522
01:32:58,190 --> 01:32:58,650
Who knows?

1523
01:32:59,330 --> 01:33:00,630
She also has bad habits.

1524
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:01,930
Lame.

1525
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:03,050
So sad.

1526
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:04,550
But he has bad eyesight.

1527
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:06,890
So he picked the wrong thing, right?

1528
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:08,250
On accident, probably.

1529
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:12,470
It was Freddy all this time.

1530
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:14,130
Don't trust anybody.

1531
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:15,790
Not even yourself.

1532
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:22,820
So maybe he's being framed by Boris.

1533
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:48,160
One day he'll complete this puzzle.

1534
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:51,360
It's because I did the other one so quickly.

1535
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,970
Laura does hate Freddy.

1536
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:03,670
Look at the pits at this point.

1537
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:04,130
It's painful.

1538
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:05,330
I'm sorry!

1539
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:08,510
Laura wants Freddy.

1540
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:09,490
I tried though.

1541
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:10,490
I tried Laura.

1542
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:13,230
And Freddy is being framed by Laura.

1543
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:14,610
But I don't...

1544
01:34:14,610 --> 01:34:15,630
It didn't work.

1545
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:17,450
What?

1546
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:19,410
Keep cooking, but don't listen to the haters.

1547
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:21,030
At this point, I have no idea.

1548
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:28,910
At this point, I'm so confused if it's a bag, if it's a bag,
if it's a mug, if it's a salami, if it's a lunch.

1549
01:34:29,010 --> 01:34:29,990
I have no idea.

1550
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:32,730
I have no idea.

1551
01:34:40,230 --> 01:34:44,030
Is it because the salami band had picked the wrong lunch?

1552
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:46,370
things must be wrong.

1553
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:47,050
So no.

1554
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:48,270
Oh, whoops.

1555
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:49,130
Uh, wait.

1556
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:50,670
Back.

1557
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:56,980
Hmm.

1558
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:58,840
You gotta think like a dog.

1559
01:34:59,060 --> 01:34:59,920
I'm not a dog.

1560
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:00,800
I'm a ghost.

1561
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:01,900
There's twists.

1562
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,660
The double cross is Kochi Mahoom.

1563
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,780
And with Chad, I think the mug did it.

1564
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:12,500
Oh, did we try clicking on that book on the desk somewhere?

1565
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:14,460
Is this all because I didn't sign the book?

1566
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:15,740
Dang it.

1567
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:24,680
the colonel i don't think the hints are literally going to
give anything though detective work isn't easy ponder

1568
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:31,880
details the thing that bothered me in particular was the
culprit to figure out the situation about the culprit i had

1569
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:39,900
to consider important objects what objects stood out in this
case i had to check again which objects the people involved

1570
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:49,200
interacted with i had to take into consideration who the
note in the fridge was signed by and why they to take action

1571
01:35:49,200 --> 01:36:01,300
I had a feeling something bigger was going on than meets the
eye thanks duck detective clearly Ocelot must be responsible

1572
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:23,590
wait so so who signed the note that's a great question this
little the This, this, I thought, honestly, if you had told

1573
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:28,430
me it was like a poorly drawn sun, like a sunrise, I would
have believed you.

1574
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:31,170
But it's a claw.

1575
01:36:32,110 --> 01:36:33,510
I thought it was a sun at first.

1576
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:35,150
So who has the claws?

1577
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:38,470
Freddy's got claws.

1578
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:41,950
Manfred's got claws, doesn't he?

1579
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:44,270
I have to go back and look at everybody's claws.

1580
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:48,750
She's got divorced.

1581
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:52,610
This guy has no hand...

1582
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:52,770
Wait.

1583
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:54,710
He's got claws!

1584
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:58,550
Everybody's got claws, I think.

1585
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:06,850
Oh, sorry.

1586
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:10,650
I pressed the wrong button.

1587
01:37:11,110 --> 01:37:11,590
Or did I?

1588
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:13,010
Maybe I pressed the right button.

1589
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:16,270
Oh, yeah.

1590
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:17,070
This is baby food.

1591
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:18,910
I was like, wait, he's got evidence on him.

1592
01:37:20,590 --> 01:37:23,750
I'm so glad Vintez realized that I'm framing Freddy.

1593
01:37:34,990 --> 01:37:36,250
Oh, this way.

1594
01:37:36,490 --> 01:37:37,290
Hold on.

1595
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:39,530
Laura, let me see her hands.

1596
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:42,030
Oh, those are really claw-like.

1597
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:43,350
But why would she steal...

1598
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:44,150
See, that's...

1599
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:47,670
I mean, she's stealing her old lunch, but she's also trying
to get this guy fired.

1600
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:49,090
She's like, fire Freddy.

1601
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:49,870
Fire Freddy.

1602
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:53,310
She hates him.

1603
01:37:53,810 --> 01:37:53,910
Oh.

1604
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:11,980
Oh, that's a cap song.

1605
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,980
So I feel like it's gotta be Laura, right?

1606
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:16,920
Because...

1607
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,640
But he picked up the mug.

1608
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:20,540
I feel like that is correct.

1609
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:23,700
That Freddy is being framed by Laura because Freddy took her
mug again.

1610
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:26,160
But I don't understand why it's wrong.

1611
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:29,440
What Freddy do.

1612
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,140
He took her mug.

1613
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:35,920
And she said, I hate when people take my mug.

1614
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:41,370
It's obvious the duck detective.

1615
01:38:41,770 --> 01:38:45,170
But planted the evidence himself that gave himself amnesia.

1616
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:46,230
The perfect crime.

1617
01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:49,490
You're too far ahead.

1618
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:54,860
What do you mean?

1619
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:56,840
Change the name?

1620
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:03,080
The Salami Bandit is being...

1621
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:04,500
I

1622
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:10,060
feel like it has to be...

1623
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:12,380
Like, being suspicious by who?

1624
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:13,720
That doesn't make any sense.

1625
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:16,860
Someone is being suspicious by someone.

1626
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:18,040
That doesn't make any sense.

1627
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:20,320
Huh?

1628
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,600
The answer is more simple than you think.

1629
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:24,300
What?

1630
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:25,840
Just tell me at this point!

1631
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:28,440
What?

1632
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:31,520
I should say these are the five gifted.

1633
01:39:43,390 --> 01:39:44,930
Oh my god!

1634
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:49,930
That was three things wrong.

1635
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:58,290
I hope the, I hope the, I hope the, um...

1636
01:39:58,290 --> 01:40:00,310
The devs are not watching this right now.

1637
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:05,030
How am I overcomplicating it?

1638
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:09,250
Please have a meeting in an hour!

1639
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,210
Oh my god.

1640
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:23,850
There's only so many things.

1641
01:40:23,970 --> 01:40:25,970
I feel like framed makes the most sense, right?

1642
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:29,330
The duck detective is being framed.

1643
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:38,590
Freddy is the correct thing here.

1644
01:40:41,170 --> 01:40:41,770
Suspicious.

1645
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:35,930
Suspicious.

1646
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:52,500
It's actually a good sound.

1647
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:00,520
I don't know how to simplify this anymore than I already
have.

1648
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,920
I don't know how to simplify this more than I already have.

1649
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,780
This is why I gave up the life of being a detective.

1650
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:20,610
I'm gonna go get more tea.

1651
01:42:20,790 --> 01:42:21,550
I'll be right back.

1652
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:23,430
I'll be right back.

1653
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:24,790
I'm gonna just go get more tea.

1654
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:58,360
I'm back.

1655
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:00,440
Yeah.

1656
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:04,300
Okay.

1657
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:10,420
Okay, thank you.

1658
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:13,140
Oh, wrong thing.

1659
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,440
Oh, this too.

1660
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:17,860
Did you catch any fish?

1661
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:20,960
I got a whole boat load.

1662
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:24,360
A whole boat load.

1663
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:28,540
Okay, back to my...

1664
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:35,900
It just messaged me something really stupid.

1665
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:42,840
It was the Colonel Mustard in the library with the candles.

1666
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:43,980
Like, I knew it.

1667
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:44,740
I knew it.

1668
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:45,440
I knew it.

1669
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:47,700
Oh, my gosh.

1670
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:50,760
Will the fish fit in your hat?

1671
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,740
No, they're really huge fish.

1672
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:55,420
Why would they fit in my hat?

1673
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:56,220
That makes no sense.

1674
01:46:00,010 --> 01:46:00,310
Okay.

1675
01:46:02,710 --> 01:46:03,150
Okay.

1676
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:09,120
So is it?

1677
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:10,980
The Salami Bandit?

1678
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,520
Picked up...

1679
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:12,760
No.

1680
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:16,200
Is he being framed maybe by the Salami Bandit?

1681
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:24,540
Yeah, I'm having a mental breakdown.

1682
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:29,100
The wrong back.

1683
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:33,040
It was as I thought.

1684
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:34,760
Really?

1685
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,820
Was it actually detective?

1686
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:03,640
VOD watchers can resume from here.

1687
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:09,840
Yeah, make sure everybody timestamps this moment so
everybody knows when to click back in.

1688
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:14,240
Freddy Fredderson was actually being framed.

1689
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:16,640
That's what I said!

1690
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:25,120
This office wasn't as boring as it looked.

1691
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:39,540
When Freddy took the bus back and he went to pick up his
luggage, he must have picked up the wrong bag this happened

1692
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:48,980
because there was another bag that's identical to his the
bag that he picked up belonged to the bandit oh i almost

1693
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:57,840
said the sausage bandit i can't even remember and to get rid
of freddy the salami bandit decided to frame him why didn't

1694
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:07,020
you just say hey that's my bag it's time for you know what
salami van and just say hey man that's my bag

1695
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:17,840
oh my god thank you for that super super detective your
investigative skills are second to many first

1696
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:30,480
oh god yeah resting your voice by the way okay get into
position me my throat has been really bad lately also me i

1697
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:53,360
wonder why i just texted her so she should be hearing hmm
huh what's this surprise surprise no way this is all for me

1698
01:48:58,180 --> 01:49:10,160
huh a letter oh it's more salat oh oh no salami What a
terrible present.

1699
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:13,260
No, you silly idiot.

1700
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,960
The real present got stolen and switched for salami.

1701
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:20,940
Oh, it's the salami bandit.

1702
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,400
I think it's for the five-gifted.

1703
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,780
I saw an awful lot of high-grade salami in Fredrickson's
bag.

1704
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:30,060
Oh, that's really suspicious that you would immediately name
him.

1705
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:37,940
You screamed about Freddy being framed just now right as I
was re-watching the part from yesterday's podcast episode

1706
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:40,980
where you started yelling, Freddy, his name is Freddy, and
it's...

1707
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:45,700
And now there's no question who the perpetrator is.

1708
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:49,260
I've been telling you all along, we can't trust Fredderson.

1709
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,640
By the end of the day, he'll be fired.

1710
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:52,360
Whoa!

1711
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:53,540
My words.

1712
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:54,760
Ooh, oh.

1713
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:59,900
Seems like a bit of an overreaction to a present being
stolen.

1714
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:01,120
What are you talking about?

1715
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:01,900
She's crying.

1716
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,220
Is there more to it?

1717
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:05,780
She's crying.

1718
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:11,020
So Sophie received the following presents.

1719
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:11,240
Okay.

1720
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:20,220
I really don't want to get involved.

1721
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:22,140
Anyway.

1722
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:23,800
Oh, wait.

1723
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:25,100
Oh, we did all this.

1724
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:25,580
Just kidding.

1725
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:28,720
That's not nice at all.

1726
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:32,660
The moment you said surprise, my browser decided to reset
itself.

1727
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:33,540
I know what.

1728
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:34,100
Haunted.

1729
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:48,800
yeah who messes with someone's birthday let's see someone
gifted Sophie a plushie a plushie it says limited edition oh

heart-shaped necklace looks tacky oof that's probably Boris

1731
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:04,740
this one wait this is the sexy alien book right sexy aliens
want my number

1732
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:15,200
Captain Brightbeak stared deep into the alien's eyes.

1733
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,980
There were 12 of them, and they were red.

1734
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,320
The eyes, not the aliens.

1735
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:25,560
All the aliens were blue, and there were 43.

1736
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:33,640
All of them wore shiny metal armor, which shined like
something shiny made of curved metal.

1737
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:43,060
Captain Brightbeak could tell it was the lead alien because
it was the one which stepped forward.

1738
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:48,360
It was also the most beautiful, the only one with purple
eyes.

1739
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:51,420
It made a noise that sounded a bit like talking.

1740
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:56,900
From a hole that looked a bit like a pretty lady's mouth.

1741
01:51:57,620 --> 01:52:06,620
The translation device the captain had invented word into
action, translating the words into words he could understand

1742
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:20,860
hey you look cute a mechanical voice whispered into his ear

01:52:49,890 --> 01:52:55,270
Buong, buong, buongiorno, everyone.

Everyone, not just Sophie.

1748
01:52:58,810 --> 01:52:59,090
Weird message.

1749
01:52:59,210 --> 01:53:00,550
Also, E is underlined.

1750
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:01,610
B.

1751
01:53:07,050 --> 01:53:08,090
Quite a lot.

1752
01:53:08,110 --> 01:53:11,830
Unbelievable, I entered the office really easily.

1753
01:53:13,010 --> 01:53:14,410
Sayonara, edge lords.

1754
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:18,730
Cocky attitude.

1755
01:53:19,230 --> 01:53:19,710
Salami.

1756
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:24,130
Why is the B?

1757
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:25,590
B-E.

1758
01:53:26,250 --> 01:53:28,210
They're the only two things underlined.

1759
01:53:29,190 --> 01:53:29,890
Suspicious.

1760
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:32,110
B-E.

1761
01:53:33,210 --> 01:53:36,190
I wonder what the purpose of that letter is.

1762
01:53:46,090 --> 01:53:56,210
I think it's Boris gave the necklace and then something got

1764
01:54:06,930 --> 01:54:07,890
Oh, whoops.

1765
01:54:08,610 --> 01:54:09,170
I'm depressed.

1766
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:10,170
Oh, wait.

1767
01:54:10,570 --> 01:54:12,430
I should...

1768
01:54:12,430 --> 01:54:12,810
It's a...

1769
01:54:12,810 --> 01:54:13,330
Oh, it's R.

1770
01:54:13,530 --> 01:54:13,750
My bad.

1771
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:14,850
Uh, this one.

1772
01:54:15,190 --> 01:54:17,270
Can you tell me something about this letter?

1773
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:18,150
About this letter?

1774
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:20,530
Sophie won't even talk to me about it.

1775
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:22,390
I don't know what to do.

1776
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:23,450
Mm-hmm.

1777
01:54:26,850 --> 01:54:28,630
And she won't talk to me either.

1778
01:54:29,710 --> 01:54:30,190
Err.

1779
01:54:31,750 --> 01:54:32,230
Okay.

1780
01:54:32,890 --> 01:54:33,690
Let's keep going.

1781
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:34,650
Let's ask other...

1782
01:54:34,650 --> 01:54:35,830
Is this Hades too?

1783
01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:39,750
What do you have to say about it, huh?

1784
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:43,070
So...

1785
01:54:43,070 --> 01:54:46,610
What happens to the cake now?

1786
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:50,800
Rufus...

1787
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,840
Oh my gosh, I almost just spilled something.

1788
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:56,400
What do you think about this letter?

1789
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:57,460
Hmm.

1790
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:00,960
People don't know how to write letters by hand anymore.

1791
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:03,760
This guy is back in my day.

1792
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:06,840
Oh, because he's an author.

1793
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:18,740
because he's an author he's all he's all like it's got to be
perfect you know okay they they really think i've done it

someone gave me a salami surprise that's you know what

1796
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:40,580
that's a typical you know Mass is life and boob is hometown.

1797
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:41,460
Don't change, man.

1798
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:45,000
Thanks for the super chat, Led.

1799
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:49,620
I'll eat salami sandwiches for breakfast, lunch, and dinner
from now on.

1800
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:52,140
That's not the point.

1801
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:53,860
Dufous.

1802
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:57,600
I want to get into the server room.

1803
01:55:58,560 --> 01:55:59,940
Wait, maybe we can get in now.

1804
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:01,320
Because no one's here.

1805
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:03,020
It says it's locked.

1806
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:03,420
Dang.

1807
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:05,000
Let's go.

1808
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:06,360
She likes the cats, though.

1809
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:07,460
So I'm guessing that one's...

1810
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:21,780
from and you know uh laura is a cat so guessing that one's
from her and then boris and then but who did it get stolen

1811
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:31,900
who's got stolen unless it's uh freddy's got stolen probably
because they're framing him right do you know anything about

1812
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:35,540
this letter well it's obviously a cheap Right, right,
Frederson.

1813
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:40,040
Hopefully, he would find this funner.

1814
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:45,180
I'm guessing you're ready to present legal evidence of
Frederson's misconducts.

1815
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:46,800
It wasn't Frederson.

1816
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,520
Everything is pointing towards him.

1817
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:52,580
I will present the true culprit soon enough.

1818
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:53,420
Soon enough.

1819
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:56,060
Well, I don't really care how long it takes you.

1820
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,140
This will be Frederson's last day.

1821
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:00,520
Oh, wow.

1822
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:03,240
Whoa, everybody, everybody wants him fired.

1823
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:06,600
Ducks are 70% more...

1824
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:07,080
likely.

1825
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:10,500
Also, yeah, someone said that her that Laura's computer is
free.

1826
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:11,660
What's this one, though?

1827
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:14,800
This folder says manual for CS agents.

1828
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:19,260
How and when to create vouchers correctly?

1829
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:22,060
I'm falling asleep just reading the title.

1830
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:23,480
I think it's great reading.

1831
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:24,180
Alright, let's see.

1832
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:25,040
What do we got here?

1833
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:26,120
Sophie.

1834
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:28,500
Chat to friends.

1835
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:30,100
Okay, what are they talking about?

1836
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:46,080
But something returned but they're sexy now by now the

1839
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:13,860
definitely don't want to be Laura's enemy.

1840
01:58:17,060 --> 01:58:18,980
So Laura gave the plushie.

1841
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:21,740
Rufus gave the book.

1842
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:23,160
And maybe...

1843
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:24,920
Oh, uh...

1844
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:26,220
Something got stolen.

1845
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:28,820
Books.

1846
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:29,760
Letters.

1847
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:30,880
Necklaces.

1848
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:32,360
Plushies.

1849
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:35,740
Nothing got stolen.

1850
01:58:36,140 --> 01:58:36,720
Everybody...

1851
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:39,660
So, nothing got stolen after all.

1852
01:58:39,940 --> 01:58:40,300
Okay.

1853
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:43,640
that the salami present was intentional.

1854
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:48,220
Very interesting indeed.

1855
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:50,740
It's a conspiracy.

1856
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:55,320
Yeah, they say salami banned it, but people's stuff was
there.

1857
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:56,740
Hmm.

1858
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:04,920
When can I get sexy alien, alien, sexy aliens want my number
two?

1859
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:08,080
When can I get that?

1860
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:15,600
Okay, I'll...

1861
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:16,900
I'll comfort her.

1862
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:21,800
You have the duck detective here to figure everything out.

1863
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:26,940
What can you possibly do?

1864
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:28,000
I'm a detective.

1865
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,160
Leave me alone.

1866
01:59:30,620 --> 01:59:30,880
Okay.

1867
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:32,020
Sorry, ma'am.

1868
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:33,580
Um.

1869
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:37,820
Is there something in here that we're...

1870
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:38,000
Oh.

1871
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:39,660
The message.

1872
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:41,560
Receive the blank.

1873
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:44,680
Oh, wait.

1874
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:45,560
We have to talk to Boris.

1875
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:46,520
I don't know where he is.

1876
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:47,120
Oh my goodness.

1877
01:59:48,660 --> 01:59:49,620
Completely forgot about him.

1878
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:55,180
And oh yeah, there's also Margaret's PC.

1879
01:59:56,660 --> 02:00:00,900
So now, blue skinned alien.

1880
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:03,080
Meat and sexy aliens.

1881
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:03,920
Blue skinned alien.

1882
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:05,960
Purple.

1883
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:09,980
Red-eyed alien.

1884
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:12,180
Uh.

1885
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:13,440
Shiny.

1886
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:15,060
Armored.

1887
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:15,600
Wait.

1888
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:19,000
Wait, wait, purple-eyed alien.

1889
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:20,940
Nice.

1890
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:22,660
She's the main alien.

1891
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:27,380
Let's see what secret she has on her computer.

1892
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:29,160
Ha-ha-ha, secrets.

1893
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:30,620
Let's see.

1894
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:32,620
West VPN?

1895
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:34,860
Secret cake recipes.

1896
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:38,040
Never gonna give you up that wave.

1897
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:43,840
Bus bear internal vouchers for CS agents.

1898
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:49,460
compensation, booked on next bus, a vacation, eh?

1899
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:52,080
Planned trip, interesting.

1900
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:54,460
Oh, delete everything!

1901
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:00,160
CUTY!

1902
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:11,200
Illegal activity?

1903
02:01:16,770 --> 02:01:19,270
But the alien, it has to be Rufus.

1904
02:01:20,150 --> 02:01:21,570
This makes me never want to work in an office.

1905
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:23,150
This is exactly what it's like, even.

1906
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:25,130
Who is this person she's messaging?

1907
02:01:26,330 --> 02:01:27,610
I don't think I have a clue.

1908
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:31,130
Oh, wait.

1909
02:01:31,230 --> 02:01:32,290
We've already talked about it.

1910
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:34,370
Okay, let's go see what Boris thinks, though.

1911
02:01:34,450 --> 02:01:35,170
We haven't talked to him.

1912
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:41,640
Oh, what's this now?

1913
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:48,140
Customs procedures for passengers entering from the west
border.

1914
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,540
Allowed goods.

1915
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:56,940
Personal items worth less than 500 schmark.

1916
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:00,200
Notify the local police about suspicious activity.

1917
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:01,640
Prohibited goods.

1918
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:04,140
Oh, there better not be salami on this list.

1919
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:05,220
Weapons.

1920
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:06,440
Gun.

1921
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:07,160
Scary.

1922
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:12,140
Over 10 trombones.

1923
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:14,780
Meat!

1924
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:18,200
Potatoes.

1925
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:22,020
Books not in the interests of the eastern states.

1926
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:23,260
Plants.

1927
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:25,680
Luggage will be checked at the bus station.

1928
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:28,620
For more information, visit this place

1929
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:35,590
But also books not in the interest of the...

1930
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:37,140
Uh-oh.

1931
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:40,500
If they're going on a trip...

1932
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:43,500
He can't... He has his books.

1933
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:44,820
What do they have against potatoes?

1934
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:48,570
Potato famine is not a joke.

1935
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:54,080
Maybe it was too romantic.

1936
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:56,240
Did Sophie ask about me?

1937
02:02:58,120 --> 02:02:58,660
Um...

1938
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:01,180
What do you think, guys?

1939
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:02,240
Should we give this guy some follow-up?

1940

Nice...

1948
02:04:48,430 --> 02:04:49,110
Well...

1949
02:04:49,110 --> 02:04:50,310
A nice salami.

1950
02:04:50,650 --> 02:04:53,550
That contained a scary salami.

1951
02:04:54,050 --> 02:04:54,710
Oh no!

1952
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:02,760
It wasn't a nice salami after all!

1953
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:04,940
It was a scary salami!

1954
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:06,460
Wait, hold on.

1955
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:08,660
Let's go back inside.

1956
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:12,720
I don't want to be, you know, doing my work in the rain
after all.

1957
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:15,310
Let's go in here.

1958
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:23,380
So would it be this?

1959
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:26,940
B-E.

1960
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:30,440
I don't think anybody's initials are that, are they?

1961
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:33,880
Boris.

1962
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:36,760
That's a B.

1963
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:39,880
Hmm.

1964
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:41,300
Hmm.

1965
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:45,860
It's salamis all the way down.

1966
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:48,660
Salami, salami, salami.

1967
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,180
So what is the message?

1968
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:53,960
Is it this message?

1969
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:56,260
Or is it...

1970
02:05:56,260 --> 02:05:57,660
I think it's a...

1971
02:05:57,660 --> 02:05:58,880
Oh no, here we go again.

1972
02:05:59,740 --> 02:06:01,260
Is this message, though, right?

1973
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:02,700
That's what I'm assuming.

1974
02:06:07,940 --> 02:06:10,240
So, Margaret received...

1975
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:13,880
So it's the message in the box, not the message she received
on the computer?

1976
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:24,100
In the box.

1977
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:27,440
Oh, okay.

1978
02:06:28,420 --> 02:06:31,540
Well, Sophie received a nice salami.

1979
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:36,240
A scary message.

1980
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:38,160
That contained.

1981
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:40,980
A nice salami.

1982
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,260
Take a closer look at the note.

1983
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:49,120
Well, it said, like, it was like a...

1984
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:51,400
It was like a cocky message.

1985
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:52,120
It was like...

1986
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:56,420
It was like a...

1987
02:06:57,180 --> 02:06:58,560
Yeah, a cocky attitude.

1988
02:06:58,700 --> 02:07:00,160
A weird message!

1989
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:04,920
Quite unbelievable.

1990
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:07,000
I entered the office really easily.

1991
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:09,420
But also, why is this whole part blank?

1992
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:11,500
Why did they write it like that?

1993
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:15,560
A cocky salami.

1994
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:17,600
This is the content I come here for.

1995
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:18,500
Also, rip your throat.

1996
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:23,120
Oh wait.

1997
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,300
Just wanted to say that your laugh is extremely charming.

1998
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:27,880
I feel happy while listening to you laugh.

1999
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:28,700
Thank you.

2000
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:31,140
Your brain cell.

2001
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:31,600
Oh my god.

2002
02:07:31,780 --> 02:07:32,880
Oh they're kind of behind.

2003
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:33,360
Oh my goodness.

2004
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:37,940
The brain cell you took with you after leaving heaven really
put in the work.

2005
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:41,620
Okay.

2006
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:43,060
So she received.

2007
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:45,280
None of these are strange.

2008
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:46,800
A silly message.

2009
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:49,100
It's not a romantic.

2010
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:51,120
She received a...

2011
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:56,140
A silly sal- Salami.

2012
02:07:56,980 --> 02:07:57,340
Letter.

2013
02:07:57,980 --> 02:07:58,860
A scary letter.

2014
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:00,080
Not scary.

2015
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:01,660
It's not a nice letter though.

2016
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:03,440
It's not a silly letter either.

2017
02:08:04,160 --> 02:08:04,660
Scary letter.

2018
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:07,180
That contained...

2019
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:09,100
I'm so confused by these adjectives.

2020
02:08:10,700 --> 02:08:11,860
A romantic salami.

2021
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:15,780
I think a romantic salami sounds really correct.

2022
02:08:19,970 --> 02:08:21,070
You're us.

2023
02:08:22,430 --> 02:08:23,210
Thank you!

2024
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:25,850
Mint, my voice hasn't really recovered.

2025
02:08:26,070 --> 02:08:28,290
Also mint, has a mental breakdown and guard these creatures.

2026
02:08:30,510 --> 02:08:32,490
Maybe in reverse?

2027
02:08:35,150 --> 02:08:36,670
Contained a...

2028
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:37,750
nice salami?

2029
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:44,660
Hmm.

2030
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,060
A silly salami?

2031
02:08:54,790 --> 02:08:56,890
Oh, maybe silly letter?

2032
02:08:58,230 --> 02:08:59,670
Scary salami?

2033
02:09:02,750 --> 02:09:03,770
I think B.E.

2034
02:09:03,870 --> 02:09:04,930
is Bema Emmerich.

2035
02:09:05,590 --> 02:09:06,990
What's wrong with B.E?

2036
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:13,070
A.

2037
02:09:13,410 --> 02:09:14,630
Is there a present in here?

2038
02:09:15,890 --> 02:09:17,650
No, there's no present.

2039
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:22,210
There's nothing in here that says, like, she received a
present, you know?

2040
02:09:26,060 --> 02:09:29,680
She's received salami that contained a letter.

2041
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:32,240
I guess?

2042
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:38,640
What else is in here?

2043
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:44,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, a silly letter that contained a
scary message.

2044
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:47,900
Why is it a silly letter, though?

2045
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:50,720
Why is it a silly letter?

2046
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:53,140
I needed to find out why.

2047
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:56,680
Okay, it was a letter that contained a message.

2048
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:57,800
Got it, got it, got it.

2049
02:09:58,860 --> 02:10:00,000
Oh, oh, no, there's more.

2050
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:05,380
Blank are being blanks, blanks from blank.

2051
02:10:11,420 --> 02:10:12,720
Books are being...

2052
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:15,740
illegally imported from...

2053
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:21,760
Wait.

2054
02:10:28,070 --> 02:10:29,350
Where was the...

2055
02:10:30,290 --> 02:10:31,850
Oh, no, not this one.

2056
02:10:32,590 --> 02:10:33,250
The vacation?

2057
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:37,820
Brazil?

2058
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,460
I don't think there was a Brazil.

2059
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:43,780
Brazil!

2060
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,080
That's from Brazil.

2061
02:10:52,980 --> 02:10:56,940
Unless it's not books, unless it's salamis.

2062
02:11:04,930 --> 02:11:07,670
That explains all the high-grade salami.

2063
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:10,970
Yeah, because it was on the letter or on the receipt, right?

2064
02:11:10,990 --> 02:11:13,110
We just needed to find out who was behind this.

2065
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:18,030
The mystery of the salami bandits was slowly getting
unraveled.

2066
02:11:18,150 --> 02:11:18,910
It was on the receipt.

2067
02:11:19,950 --> 02:11:24,550
Western goods are prohibited from entering and being sold in
the East.

2068
02:11:26,930 --> 02:11:40,070
this is why the salami bandit decided to make a business out
of buying high-grade salami in the west oh and that's why

2069
02:11:40,070 --> 02:11:47,130
you didn't want him to take his bag and selling it at a high
profit and then they're gonna go on vacation with the money

2070
02:11:47,130 --> 02:11:54,310
also for some reason sophie received a letter from the
salami bandit because they were making fun of his book and

2071
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:56,910
had a hidden Threatening message.

2072
02:11:58,850 --> 02:11:59,450
Wait.

2073
02:11:59,950 --> 02:12:00,990
Why are all the letters there?

2074
02:12:01,070 --> 02:12:01,750
They look different.

2075
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:03,410
This was serious.

2076
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:06,210
I had to question all of the employees.

2077
02:12:06,470 --> 02:12:07,050
All of them.

2078
02:12:07,750 --> 02:12:10,210
They were making fun of his book, and so they're upset.

2079
02:12:11,230 --> 02:12:12,670
Thanks for coming, everyone.

2080
02:12:13,590 --> 02:12:17,030
Well, everyone except for Sophie.

2081
02:12:18,110 --> 02:12:18,870
Where is she?

2082
02:12:20,270 --> 02:12:21,130
Slacking off.

2083
02:12:21,530 --> 02:12:23,630
Playing on her computer phone.

2084
02:12:24,030 --> 02:12:25,110
Computer phone.

2085
02:12:25,410 --> 02:12:27,690
She's having problems with her family.

2086
02:12:27,970 --> 02:12:28,050
Oh.

2087
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:32,010
She was at her desk and said she needed a moment.

2088
02:12:32,350 --> 02:12:32,470
No.

2089
02:12:35,530 --> 02:12:36,850
Romani, welcome to membership.

2090
02:12:37,030 --> 02:12:37,490
Thank you.

2091
02:12:38,850 --> 02:12:40,450
I will start then regardless.

2092
02:12:41,470 --> 02:12:45,930
I have made my deductions and drawn some serious
conclusions.

2093
02:12:46,310 --> 02:12:47,150
Serious conclusions.

2094
02:12:48,030 --> 02:12:48,510
Finally.

2095
02:12:49,110 --> 02:12:50,650
Is Freddy getting fired then?

2096
02:12:50,770 --> 02:12:52,770
Oh gosh, Freddy's not getting fired, you guys.

2097
02:12:52,830 --> 02:12:53,710
This is pretty bad.

2098
02:12:54,110 --> 02:12:55,290
Laura's gonna be so mad at me.

2099
02:12:55,410 --> 02:12:56,410
Who is the murderer?

2100
02:12:58,270 --> 02:12:59,150
I... what?

2101
02:12:59,970 --> 02:13:01,210
No one died.

2102
02:13:02,190 --> 02:13:07,050
I went to check out hives for the first time since braiding
them, since the washboards and the roads out there were bad

2103
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:09,330
enough to where they rattled my windshield.

2104
02:13:10,450 --> 02:13:11,130
Wait, are you okay?

2105
02:13:12,030 --> 02:13:12,790
Just wanted to let...

2106
02:13:12,790 --> 02:13:13,850
All of you are fine.

2107
02:13:14,070 --> 02:13:15,210
Oh, glad they're okay.

2108
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:16,290
I'm getting raped!

2109
02:13:16,530 --> 02:13:17,190
I'm telling you!

2110
02:13:17,330 --> 02:13:19,970
You are, but not by Laura, who I originally thought.

2111
02:13:20,070 --> 02:13:21,690
Want a load of baloney?

2112
02:13:21,870 --> 02:13:22,630
No, actually.

2113
02:13:23,570 --> 02:13:24,010
Salami!

2114
02:13:24,010 --> 02:13:27,370
He is right, actually.

2115
02:13:28,170 --> 02:13:29,290
He is getting framed.

2116
02:13:31,970 --> 02:13:33,630
Laura's VA also does shift to Yanike.

2117
02:13:33,910 --> 02:13:34,570
No way.

2118
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:39,730
Ah, that is the question, isn't it?

2119
02:13:40,290 --> 02:13:41,970
Why would anyone bother?

2120
02:13:42,670 --> 02:13:43,790
Get to the point.

2121
02:13:44,510 --> 02:13:47,630
It's through my observations that I uncovered.

2122
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:48,570
I uncovered.

2123
02:13:49,730 --> 02:13:49,990
Oh!

2124
02:13:50,650 --> 02:13:52,030
Yeah, I mean, yes.

2125
02:13:52,190 --> 02:13:53,470
I did uncover that.

2126
02:13:55,310 --> 02:14:05,050
gasp this is ridiculous I told Hanukkah I don't believe in
the supernatural but now I do love the voice acting in this

2127
02:14:05,050 --> 02:14:14,370
it's so good listening to a random duck that waddling to
this office I'm leaving oh no no sir stop right there oh or

2128
02:14:14,370 --> 02:14:25,590

us what you know maybe made was the friends along the way or

2129

your very own buses huh what's going on okay this is going

2130
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:49,770
too far I really have more important things to do oh
everyone's leaving now that is really scandalous does that

2131
02:14:49,770 --> 02:14:54,450
mean we're losing our jobs maybe Oh!

2132
02:14:57,410 --> 02:14:58,530
Why is everybody leaving?

2133
02:15:00,350 --> 02:15:01,110
Listen, everybody!

2134
02:15:02,070 --> 02:15:05,030
It's really important that no one leaves the premises.

2135
02:15:05,670 --> 02:15:08,310
I need to get back to work.

2136
02:15:08,430 --> 02:15:09,050
Wait a second!

2137
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:14,900
Everybody's leaving?

2138
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:26,060
I'm still here, Mr. Duck Detective.

2139
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:29,760
Nobody cares!

2140
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:30,540
Yeah.

2141
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:36,920
Um, I guess we'll just continue our illegal activities.

2142
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:38,360
Wait, whose phone is this?

2143
02:15:39,980 --> 02:15:40,320
Oh.

2144
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:45,600
KT Senjoyer.

2145
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:47,340
Oh, KTS-

2146
02:15:52,340 --> 02:15:54,920
KTS- Enjoyer!

2147
02:16:06,280 --> 02:16:09,080
Almost dead.

2148
02:16:09,940 --> 02:16:12,240
Are your parents still angry at you?

2149
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:17,040
Min-ten-joy.

2150
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:25,500
That's nonsensical.

2151
02:16:29,540 --> 02:16:31,340
Did she get kidnapped?!

2152
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:32,740
This is curious.

2153
02:16:33,140 --> 02:16:34,340
I think she got kidnapped, you guys.

2154
02:16:34,580 --> 02:16:36,240
Why would she write like this?

2155
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:37,900
Uh-oh.

2156
02:16:39,660 --> 02:16:41,440
Someone forgot their phone.

2157
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:43,860
Oh, the music changed and everything.

2158
02:16:44,220 --> 02:16:44,920
It's kind of fun.

2159
02:16:46,320 --> 02:16:48,340
This is getting intense, isn't it?

2160
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:51,100
Maybe you could need a little help?

2161
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:52,180
I don't think so.

2162
02:16:52,380 --> 02:16:53,120
You seem lonely.

2163
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:53,580
Oh.

2164
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:55,320
I could be your assistant.

2165
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:57,100
Lonely added the clues.

2166
02:16:57,300 --> 02:16:58,760
This game is targeting me.

2167
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:09,780

there's a mess of a scene here.

2170
02:17:31,100 --> 02:17:32,680
I think she really was kidnapped.

2171
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:35,460
Or it was me.

2172
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:38,140
Uh-oh.

2173
02:17:38,700 --> 02:17:41,140
This is like, oh, the cat is on the ground!

2174
02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:42,780
Um...

2175
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:43,980
Sophie left!

2176
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:46,300
And she left a note on the desk!

2177
02:17:47,420 --> 02:17:48,500
Oh, she did now.

2178
02:17:49,580 --> 02:17:50,260
Did she?

2179
02:17:50,780 --> 02:17:52,000
Was this...

2180
02:17:52,680 --> 02:17:53,120
Let's...

2181
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:56,640
The last dialed number on this phone is 03...

2182
02:17:56,640 --> 02:17:57,280
Miss some streams.

2183
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:58,880
How did Sissel become a duck?

2184
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:04,140
Oh my gosh, they just doxed my phone number!

2185
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:05,800
What's this?

2186
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:07,040
Unknown number.

2187
02:18:07,860 --> 02:18:08,380
Any more.

2188
02:18:08,580 --> 02:18:09,500
I'll tell them everything.

2189
02:18:11,260 --> 02:18:12,020
Don't.

2190
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:12,960
Fight.

2191
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:15,220
You block this number.

2192
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:16,500
Click here to unblock.

2193
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:18,800
Interesting.

2194
02:18:21,220 --> 02:18:25,360
Am I the asshole for expecting my coworkers to remember my
birthday?

2195
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:28,580
It's my 20F birthday.

2196
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:31,020
And no one congratulated me.

2197
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:32,480
I don't need much.

2198
02:18:32,820 --> 02:18:35,700
But at least a handwritten card would have been nice.

2199
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:42,680
I can't believe she complained about this online.

2200
02:18:43,020 --> 02:18:45,040
She went to Reddit for it.

2201
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:46,180
It's crazy.

2202
02:18:47,940 --> 02:18:48,860
Wait, where's the no?

2203
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:49,600
Oh, here it is.

2204
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:52,480
That's it.

2205
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:53,560
I quit.

2206
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:55,860
Sudden news.

2207
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:59,880
You'll never see me again.

2208
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:00,820
Wait a second.

2209
02:19:01,300 --> 02:19:05,100
Sophie Winthimer.

2210
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:06,360
This is not her.

2211
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:07,560
This is the...

2212
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:09,220
This is the Bandit's handwriting.

2213
02:19:11,480 --> 02:19:14,080
This is the Bandit's handwriting.

2214
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:16,640
Sophie.

2215
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:17,760
Let her off.

2216
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:19,620
Uh-oh.

2217
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:22,680
What a dramatic turn.

2218
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:24,880
I should keep this as evidence.

2219
02:19:25,580 --> 02:19:26,200
Better than I.

2220
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:29,280
Get.

2221
02:19:31,620 --> 02:19:46,870
she left just like this just like this maybe she's at home
should I look for her did you read Sophie's letter I did

2222
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:59,310
something's off something's different the handwriting the
handwriting is different this is the note Sophie left can

2223
02:19:59,310 --> 02:20:02,010
you tell me more and you know who was the first person to
leave?

2224
02:20:02,590 --> 02:20:03,090
The penguin.

2225
02:20:03,670 --> 02:20:05,110
He had all the time.

2226
02:20:05,350 --> 02:20:07,050
He was the first person to leave the room.

2227
02:20:07,510 --> 02:20:08,410
It's totally him.

2228
02:20:08,690 --> 02:20:11,190
It doesn't make sense at all that she just suddenly leave.

2229
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:14,150
She definitely needs the money.

2230
02:20:14,790 --> 02:20:17,230
And she would have told me, I'm her friend.

2231
02:20:18,010 --> 02:20:18,490
Mm-hmm.

2232
02:20:22,590 --> 02:20:23,610
No, the bear was?

2233
02:20:23,670 --> 02:20:25,210
No, it was definitely the penguin.

2234
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:34,740
Would you ever do a stream where you just read Am I the
Asshole Post while playing Minecraft?

2235
02:20:34,980 --> 02:20:46,640
sure oh we can also check out his computer hey Eugene
McQuacklin throw bread to the fine beak of lady justice

2236
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:59,360

anything buy my book murder at the beaver's dam when the dam

2237
02:20:59,360 --> 02:21:02,900
broke Beaver, Bichel, lost his mind.

2238
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:04,040
Oh my God.

2239
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:05,820
Crime and thrillers.

2240
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:12,200
Kidnapping and a kingpin.

2241
02:21:12,700 --> 02:21:15,860
Never kidnap a kingpin on his birthday.

2242
02:21:19,210 --> 02:21:21,070
Murder, kidnapping, stalking?

2243
02:21:21,170 --> 02:21:22,810
This guy is such a criminal.

2244
02:21:23,730 --> 02:21:25,910
Someone is clearly obsessed with detectives.

2245
02:21:26,030 --> 02:21:27,490
You can't have a hobby anymore?

2246
02:21:27,690 --> 02:21:29,450
Okay, it's just obsession, sure.

2247
02:21:36,010 --> 02:21:37,950
What do you think of this note?

2248
02:21:38,790 --> 02:21:40,930
It's no surprise she's left, is it?

2249
02:21:41,890 --> 02:21:44,870
Would you want to work with someone you've dated in the
past?

2250
02:21:45,470 --> 02:21:45,870
Whoa.

2251
02:21:48,350 --> 02:21:50,710
Who would hire me at this age?

2252
02:21:50,930 --> 02:21:52,150
No, it's in demand.

2253
02:21:53,030 --> 02:21:55,810
Maybe I can be a real estate agent.

2254
02:21:56,010 --> 02:21:56,830
Oh my god, so true.

2255
02:21:57,210 --> 02:21:59,410
I always wanted to be a rich real estate agent.

2256
02:21:59,750 --> 02:22:01,210
Live your dreams, Margaret.

2257
02:22:04,910 --> 02:22:07,370
You sussie mix suss pants.

2258
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:09,150
Oh, I can't ask you about anything.

2259
02:22:09,250 --> 02:22:12,110
Why would Laura recruit you to deal with the theft?

2260
02:22:13,010 --> 02:22:16,310
Aren't there any other detectives who are actually qualified
for the job?

2261
02:22:16,930 --> 02:22:16,950
Wow.

2262
02:22:17,110 --> 02:22:19,630
I've been doing very well so far.

2263
02:22:19,910 --> 02:22:25,230
If I do say so myself, the truth will be revealed in the
end.

2264
02:22:25,350 --> 02:22:26,750
There's only one truth.

2265
02:22:28,630 --> 02:22:28,710
Suss.

2266
02:22:28,930 --> 02:22:30,390
Suss, suss, suss.

2267
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:32,910
Suss, suss, suss.

2268
02:22:34,910 --> 02:22:35,890
I'll be able to go back out.

2269
02:22:36,270 --> 02:22:37,310
Wait, where'd he go?

2270
02:22:40,130 --> 02:22:42,190
Uh, I'm just gonna open this.

2271
02:22:45,110 --> 02:22:46,410
Manfred is out of his office.

2272
02:22:46,730 --> 02:22:47,530
Move the painting here.

2273
02:22:47,670 --> 02:22:50,630
Time to see what's behind his precious family portrait.

2274
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:53,390
A safe.

2275
02:22:58,920 --> 02:22:59,500
CS00BD.

2276
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:03,140
Calls.

2277
02:23:03,420 --> 02:23:04,800
Customer support is too.

2278
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:06,360
Okay.

2279
02:23:06,380 --> 02:23:08,680
Zero, zero.

2280
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:15,780
Uh, zero?

2281
02:23:17,020 --> 02:23:17,640
And birthday.

2282
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:20,740
Do we know it's birthday?

2283
02:23:22,340 --> 02:23:24,360
Oh, operating office, so one?

2284
02:23:31,230 --> 02:23:32,190
Bus driver!

2285
02:23:33,110 --> 02:23:33,270
Oh.

2286
02:23:34,450 --> 02:23:35,090
Nope.

2287
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:36,350
Wait, no!

2288
02:23:36,610 --> 02:23:37,650
We have...

2289
02:23:37,650 --> 02:23:39,170
Wait, uh, we have four bus drivers.

2290
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:39,850
Yes!

2291
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:45,300
I did it!

2292
02:23:45,380 --> 02:23:46,140
I did it!

2293
02:23:46,220 --> 02:23:46,760
My god!

2294
02:23:47,660 --> 02:23:51,320
I always wanted to open a ridiculously big safe.

2295
02:23:51,660 --> 02:23:54,100
Let's see what secrets he has in here.

2296
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:57,420
Okay, we got some keys.

2297
02:23:58,260 --> 02:23:59,240

02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:04,900
Wait, this is his handwriting.

2301
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:08,220
I haven't been there for you and the kids recently.

2302
02:24:08,740 --> 02:24:10,220
But things are looking up.

2303
02:24:10,540 --> 02:24:15,620
I would love to take you to a romantic getaway to
Hollandeis.

2304
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:17,080
Love Manfred.

2305
02:24:17,580 --> 02:24:19,120
The handwriting!

2306
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:22,400
Different handwriting.

2307
02:24:24,740 --> 02:24:25,520
Demands!

2308
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:28,780
Me, employee of the month?

2309
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:30,400
TV in my room?

2310
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:32,780
Keep quiet about the thing.

2311
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:36,180
Do all these things and nothing will happen to you.

2312
02:24:36,620 --> 02:24:38,420
He's being blackmailed!

2313
02:24:46,050 --> 02:24:47,250
He's being...

2314
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:49,890
Wait, so he is probably being blackmailed.

2315
02:24:49,910 --> 02:24:53,310
put up to doing the bandit stuff by the penguin maybe.

2316
02:24:54,370 --> 02:24:57,890
Awful lot of security for a branch manager of a bus company.

2317
02:24:58,050 --> 02:24:58,830
Uh-huh.

2318
02:24:58,950 --> 02:24:59,410
Wait.

2319
02:25:00,250 --> 02:25:01,210

2320
02:25:02,030 --> 02:25:03,070
Here it is.

2321
02:25:03,470 --> 02:25:05,150
The key for the server room.

2322
02:25:05,730 --> 02:25:05,730
Yes.

2323
02:25:07,690 --> 02:25:08,170

2324
02:25:11,070 --> 02:25:11,550

Never mind.

2330
02:25:16,070 --> 02:25:16,190
It's fine.

2331
02:25:17,390 --> 02:25:18,550
It's probably okay.

2332
02:25:19,490 --> 02:25:19,670
Oh.

2333
02:25:19,910 --> 02:25:20,570
What's this tab?

2334
02:25:21,950 --> 02:25:21,970
Oh.

2335
02:25:22,890 --> 02:25:30,090
Maybe Sophie got kidnapped because...

2336
02:25:31,170 --> 02:25:31,890

2337
02:25:31,890 --> 02:25:33,950

Oh, no.

2339
02:25:42,980 --> 02:25:45,140
Sophie got kidnapped because Sophie wanted to snitch.

2340
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,060
Sophie got kidnapped!

2341
02:25:48,660 --> 02:25:50,900

I don't think they should be sparking.

2350
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:34,880
I definitely felt that I wasn't supposed to be here.

2351
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:35,860

This is his room.

2357
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:47,880
This is the penguin's room.

2358
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:50,220

we're a bad detective when we're really smart breadcrumbs

2365
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:27,680
Those fingernails, man.

2366
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:29,380
He looks like he's been biting them.

2367
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:31,760
Has that been there the whole day?

2368
02:27:32,120 --> 02:27:33,080
Oh, my gosh.

2369
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:34,360

Salami?

02:27:47,940 --> 02:27:49,140
Why don't you open it up?

2377
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:52,100
I don't think it's meant to do this.

2378
02:27:52,220 --> 02:27:53,020
I don't think so, either.

2379
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:54,480
Okay.

2380
02:27:57,320 --> 02:27:58,520
Oh, hold on.

2381
02:27:59,900 --> 02:28:02,000
Honestly, this is nicer than my apartment.

2383
02:28:03,660 --> 02:28:04,980
Don't say that.

I wanted to check real quick.

2422
02:31:27,190 --> 02:31:28,670
Ducks are named after Sir Jeffrey Duck.

02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:57,840
The number.

difficult finding replacements nowadays though uh-huh it's

2438
02:32:29,890 --> 02:32:38,430
not really a detective's job to spend crazy conspiracy
theories is it sometimes the truth is pretty crazy it seems

2439
02:32:38,430 --> 02:32:39,270
a bit cheap

2440
02:32:44,060 --> 02:32:45,380
Cheap added as a clue.

2441
02:32:46,320 --> 02:32:47,420

2446
02:32:58,400 --> 02:32:59,660
This is so sad.

2447
02:33:02,860 --> 02:33:05,400
Yeah, the handwriting is the exact same.

2448
02:33:06,200 --> 02:33:07,680
It's all in all three of these.

2449
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:10,400
Okay.

2450
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:12,140
What am I doing?

2451
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:13,100
Oh, the kidnapping.

2452
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:14,400
And the salami bandit.

02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:42,280

2459
02:33:49,100 --> 02:33:51,920

She's in a fight with her, for her life.

2468
02:35:10,490 --> 02:35:14,710
I couldn't alert the culprit, or all of this will have been
for nothing.

2469
02:35:15,570 --> 02:35:20,930
I needed to first figure out who is behind everything so I
could confront them.

2470
02:35:22,310 --> 02:35:26,630
Yeah, I thought it might be the bus because he's out here.

2471
02:35:27,170 --> 02:35:29,010
So I figured maybe he took her to the bus.

2472
02:35:29,470 --> 02:35:31,270
The most trendy duck hairstyle is a mullet.

2473
02:35:32,050 --> 02:35:32,450
Nice.

2474
02:35:32,950 --> 02:35:35,090
And also, this is closed now.

2475
02:35:35,550 --> 02:35:36,430
So, um...

2476
02:35:38,590 --> 02:35:39,330
Hey, you.

2477
02:35:40,070 --> 02:35:41,250
Salami Bandit.

2478
02:35:43,050 --> 02:35:45,050
Manfred is the Salami Bandit because...

2479
02:35:46,510 --> 02:35:49,050
Maybe Rufus and his...

2480
02:35:50,570 --> 02:35:52,310
Whoa, there's so much here.

2481
02:35:53,410 --> 02:35:53,830
Oh, wait.

2482
02:35:53,950 --> 02:35:54,390
Because...

2483
02:35:55,630 --> 02:35:56,070
Because...

2484
02:35:56,510 --> 02:36:01,770
The Salami Bandits and his handwriting are identical.

2485
02:36:04,790 --> 02:36:14,410

incriminating manfred instead done done something was
missing here who else was with this.

2491
02:37:03,290 --> 02:37:04,950
I had collected everything I needed.

2492
02:37:05,530 --> 02:37:07,890
I just had to organize my thoughts.

2493
02:37:08,530 --> 02:37:08,530
Okay.

2494
02:37:09,350 --> 02:37:09,930
Uh.

2495
02:37:12,610 --> 02:37:13,650
Oh, okay.

2496
02:37:14,050 --> 02:37:16,390
So maybe... That's why...

2497
02:37:16,390 --> 02:37:19,130
That's why she got kidnapped because Boris was in on it.

2498
02:37:19,750 --> 02:37:21,550
And that's why she was like, I'm gonna come clean.

2499
02:37:32,290 --> 02:37:33,650
The murdering!

2500
02:37:38,450 --> 02:37:52,510
The importing God I want I wish God I wish the salami bandit
wasn't working alone no it made sense for the bus driver to

2501
02:37:52,510 --> 02:38:07,270
be involved yeah oh there's more infatuation no he used to
date wait well Boris is the salon accomplice because he used

2502
02:38:07,270 --> 02:38:19,310
to date Sophie and the slimy bandit needed someone who could
convince someone into murdering no wait a second the

2503
02:38:19,310 --> 02:38:36,330
infatuation don't say that don't say that don't don't after
what happened earlier

2504
02:38:40,510 --> 02:38:42,330
He used to date Sophie.

2505
02:38:42,870 --> 02:38:43,690
Horace used to date.

2506
02:38:44,090 --> 02:38:45,350
But why would he be an accomplice?

2507
02:38:45,490 --> 02:38:47,470
He needed to convince...

2508
02:38:47,470 --> 02:38:50,230
Could convince Sophie into...

2509
02:38:50,970 --> 02:38:51,450
Dating.

2510
02:38:51,630 --> 02:38:52,270
What does that mean?

2511
02:38:52,370 --> 02:38:52,550
No.

2512
02:38:53,250 --> 02:38:53,850
Into helping?

2513
02:38:55,950 --> 02:38:56,430
Or...

2514
02:38:57,130 --> 02:38:58,410
Convince her to snitch...

2515
02:38:58,410 --> 02:38:59,170
Oh, selling.

2516
02:38:59,590 --> 02:38:59,850
Wait!

2517
02:39:00,910 --> 02:39:01,390
Um...

2518
02:39:02,210 --> 02:39:03,030
Who would be...

2519
02:39:03,030 --> 02:39:03,750
Oh, maybe...

2520
02:39:03,750 --> 02:39:05,010
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2521
02:39:05,830 --> 02:39:06,310
Yeah.

2522
02:39:07,690 --> 02:39:09,030
Oh, no.

2523
02:39:14,910 --> 02:39:16,210
Three or more things are wrong.

2524
02:39:16,370 --> 02:39:17,970
I thought maybe he would get her in on it.

2525
02:39:18,250 --> 02:39:18,570
Like, hey.

2526
02:39:21,810 --> 02:39:25,130
Like, hey, Sophie, we need a third person in here.

2527
02:39:26,430 --> 02:39:27,670
Switch Boris and Sophie?

2528
02:39:31,410 --> 02:39:32,090
Oh, maybe.

2529
02:39:32,490 --> 02:39:32,930
Boris.

2530
02:39:34,390 --> 02:39:34,610
No.

2531
02:39:36,730 --> 02:39:37,510
Wait, no.

2532
02:39:39,330 --> 02:39:39,770
Anyway.

2533
02:39:41,570 --> 02:39:43,870
So Sophie is the salami bandit's enemy.

2534
02:39:46,270 --> 02:39:54,530
So Boris is the salami bandit's accomplice because he used
to date Sophie and the salami bandit needed someone.

2535
02:39:54,650 --> 02:39:54,890
How?

2536
02:39:56,810 --> 02:39:57,810
Boris dates a boy.

2537
02:39:57,910 --> 02:39:59,010
Sophie dates Sophie.

2538
02:40:02,250 --> 02:40:03,610
Maybe you're thinking about it wrong.

2539
02:40:03,830 --> 02:40:04,970
Maybe accomplice is wrong.

2540
02:40:12,300 --> 02:40:13,640
You read her phone.

2541
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:15,640
Yeah, and on the phone...

2542
02:40:16,940 --> 02:40:17,980
Oh wait, uh...

2543
02:40:17,980 --> 02:40:20,120
He... No, uh...

2544
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:22,720
Here said, I'll tell them everything.

2545
02:40:23,060 --> 02:40:23,520
Don't.

2546
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:25,300
And then she blocks them.

2547
02:40:32,870 --> 02:40:33,230
Right?

2548
02:40:33,490 --> 02:40:34,370
They were dating.

2549
02:40:34,910 --> 02:40:39,010
It has to be Boris about Sophie and Boris, because they're
the only ones that were dating.

2550
02:40:40,170 --> 02:40:44,130
Pretty sure Penguin Man and Margaret are still still a
thing.

2551
02:40:48,050 --> 02:40:50,290
Thank you so much for playing and enjoying the game.

2552
02:40:50,790 --> 02:40:53,710
My name is Deshaun Ricks, and I voice man for the bear!

2553
02:40:54,350 --> 02:40:55,230
Oh my god!

2554
02:40:56,770 --> 02:40:58,210
Thank you for dropping by!

2555
02:40:59,730 --> 02:41:01,190
It's so much fun!

2556
02:41:02,230 --> 02:41:04,010
And everybody's voice acting is so wonderful!

2557
02:41:04,410 --> 02:41:04,730
Thank you!

2558
02:41:05,490 --> 02:41:14,010
Oh, sorry if I'm like, um, uh, I just kind of, well, you
know, you're, you're, uh, I think I'm about to arrest you

2559
02:41:14,010 --> 02:41:15,310
maybe, but, um, you know.

2560
02:41:19,210 --> 02:41:20,770
Oh, thank you for dropping by.

2561
02:41:20,790 --> 02:41:21,110
Why?

2562
02:41:23,650 --> 02:41:25,110
Where are we thinking of the five gifting?

2563
02:41:26,830 --> 02:41:28,330
But I'm a little stupid right now.

2564
02:41:28,450 --> 02:41:29,350
Don't watch.

2565
02:41:33,690 --> 02:41:34,570
Oh, let's see.

2566
02:41:37,070 --> 02:41:41,170
I had a hair on my mic and I was like, it's tickling my
face.

2567
02:41:41,490 --> 02:41:42,950
I'm really glad it's not a spider.

2568
02:41:43,390 --> 02:41:44,930
It was a hair on my mic.

2569
02:41:45,250 --> 02:41:46,210
How did I get there?

2570
02:41:55,820 --> 02:41:57,580
What do you mean, gross?

2571
02:41:58,680 --> 02:41:59,300
It's just a hair.

2572
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:00,300
It's my own hair.

2573
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:03,960
I think it fell off my head.

2574
02:42:04,800 --> 02:42:05,640
Oh, gosh, I'm balding.

2575
02:42:08,100 --> 02:42:08,980
Anyway, what was it?

2576
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:09,160
Okay.

2577
02:42:10,060 --> 02:42:10,600
Let's see.

2578
02:42:10,780 --> 02:42:12,300
Boris is the salami...

2579
02:42:12,300 --> 02:42:14,800
Or blank is the salami bandits...

2580
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:15,360
Not lover.

2581
02:42:18,420 --> 02:42:18,860
Accomplice.

2582
02:42:21,140 --> 02:42:22,480
Because he used to date...

2583
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:22,880
Sophie.

2584
02:42:23,560 --> 02:42:25,840
The salami bandit needed someone who could convince

2585
02:42:29,440 --> 02:42:30,900
the duck detective.

2586
02:42:33,340 --> 02:42:35,300
But I have three or more things wrong.

2587
02:42:44,190 --> 02:42:44,270
Hmm.

2588
02:42:45,970 --> 02:42:47,490
So close, but so far.

2589
02:42:49,250 --> 02:42:51,170
Would it be that she's an accomplice then?

2590
02:42:52,130 --> 02:43:00,430
Sophie's an accomplice because she used to date Boers and
needed someone who could convince... I don't think it's the

2591
02:43:00,430 --> 02:43:18,270
oh wait convinced someone else maybe uh salami bandan needed
someone who could convince into selling no convinced Boris

2592
02:43:18,270 --> 02:43:27,090
into selling well he oh into helping I feel like helping and
selling are like I believe Sophie managed to talk Boris into

2593
02:43:27,090 --> 02:43:32,370
this I feel like helping and Selling are pretty close, so it
was between one of them.

2594
02:43:33,490 --> 02:43:34,010
Aha!

2595
02:43:34,870 --> 02:43:36,850
I had it all figured out now.

2596
02:43:37,850 --> 02:43:40,150
It was time that I confront the culprits.

2597
02:43:40,390 --> 02:43:41,350
Time to confront.

2598
02:43:41,570 --> 02:43:42,150
But first?

2599
02:43:42,410 --> 02:43:42,670
More?

2600
02:43:42,790 --> 02:43:44,290
I had to free Sophie.

2601
02:43:45,630 --> 02:43:47,390
Sophie, I'm coming for you!

2602
02:43:48,010 --> 02:43:49,610
Oh, there she is, exactly where I know.

2603
02:43:50,710 --> 02:43:50,930
Ugh.

2604
02:43:51,810 --> 02:43:52,330
Ugh.

2605
02:43:54,430 --> 02:43:54,950
Sophie!

2606
02:44:01,370 --> 02:44:02,850
What's going on out here?

2607
02:44:05,590 --> 02:44:15,910
they're all in on it why is everyone yelling this looks
dramatic bump bump it's kind of a long story you're very

2608
02:44:15,910 --> 02:44:22,650
nonchalant for someone who was kidnapped and has
participated in illegal activity is missing and guess who

2609
02:44:22,650 --> 02:44:29,250
deduced said long story me the one and only duck detective

2610
02:44:33,770 --> 02:44:44,410
room oh my god this is how everything went down the britzel
bear bus branch was suffering losses and had their budget

2611
02:44:44,410 --> 02:44:52,970
cut as a result uh-oh manfred worried about the financial
stability of his family felt himself backed into a quarter

2612
02:44:52,970 --> 02:45:03,750
oh my god this is when he became the salami bandit he made
his grand plan of salami smuggling and realized he could

2613
02:45:03,770 --> 02:45:05,350
couldn't do this alone.

2614
02:45:05,630 --> 02:45:05,930
Dun, dun.

2615
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:14,170
He recruited Boris, since it would be easiest for the bus
driver to load and unload the wares discreetly.

2616
02:45:14,670 --> 02:45:15,230
Discreetly.

2617
02:45:15,430 --> 02:45:19,510
The bus would go through a customs check at the South
Sitchia bus station first.

2618
02:45:19,670 --> 02:45:20,110
Uh-huh.

2619
02:45:21,290 --> 02:45:26,590
And then, Boris would take a detour to get the salami and
load it onto the bus.

2620
02:45:27,050 --> 02:45:27,350
Dun, dun, dun.

2621
02:45:27,350 --> 02:45:30,390
This is why the buses always had a huge delay.

2622
02:45:31,550 --> 02:45:40,010
It wouldn't be easy to talk bulls into crime so manfred
convinced sophie to join the team so messed up morris's

2623
02:45:40,010 --> 02:45:51,090
obsession with her would make it easy for her to manipulate
it so sad everything was going well until the duck detective

2624
02:45:51,090 --> 02:46:00,390
that's me infiltrated the office yeah Freddie was meant to
be the skit goat for the crime but I'm not fooled that

2625
02:46:00,390 --> 02:46:09,650
easily nope Sophie began getting cold feet and ultimately
wanted to confess to the police but who called the duck it

2626
02:46:09,650 --> 02:46:18,450
was laura could have this so he interfered laura called so
that she could figure out who stole her lunch and hit her in

2627
02:46:18,450 --> 02:46:28,950
the luggage compartment of one of the buses wow and this is
why manfred stole laura's lunch

2628
02:46:34,010 --> 02:46:45,530
everything is figured out but who is truly guilty Manfred
Sophie why would you do that though are all involved oh is

2629
02:46:45,530 --> 02:46:53,810
it to get get Freddy fired I guess who should get arrested
for their crimes Manfred was the mastermind behind

2630
02:46:53,810 --> 02:47:06,590
everything should Manfred get arrested oh wait we get to
choose hmm time to frame Freddy uh should we arrest freddie

2631
02:47:06,590 --> 02:47:09,290
anyway but

2632
02:47:15,650 --> 02:47:28,790
i kind of want to say no i kind of want to take freddie down
but um remember he was blackmailed that's right he was

2633
02:47:28,790 --> 02:47:39,250
blackmailed by a certain penguin he was the planner but he
technically didn't get his hands dirty not to mention what

2634
02:47:39,250 --> 02:47:46,030
it would do to his poor family wait he did get his hand wait
a second yeah that's that's i mean if you organize a murder

2635
02:47:46,030 --> 02:47:54,770
you still or just because he didn't commit the murder what
about sophie without her the smuggling wouldn't have been

2636
02:47:54,770 --> 02:48:04,330
possible she manipulated poor boris into taking the lobby
across the border wait do we get to choose for everybody

2637
02:48:04,330 --> 02:48:10,090
should sophie get arrested oh wow we can see who gets So
here we can say who gets arrested or not.

2638
02:48:11,090 --> 02:48:12,690
I feel like Sophie should get arrested.

2639
02:48:12,850 --> 02:48:15,730
I feel bad for poor Boris who got manipulated into this.

2640
02:48:17,590 --> 02:48:18,930
I think we should arrest Sophie.

2641
02:48:19,830 --> 02:48:21,090
And that's what they want you to think.

2642
02:48:21,390 --> 02:48:21,670
Maybe.

2643
02:48:23,590 --> 02:48:24,770
On her birthday.

2644
02:48:26,370 --> 02:48:29,170
She can watch KTS from jail.

2645
02:48:30,330 --> 02:48:32,830
What she did was clearly illegal.

2646
02:48:33,190 --> 02:48:33,570
Yeah!

2647
02:48:33,950 --> 02:48:36,450
She needs to face the consequences.

2648
02:48:37,390 --> 02:48:38,430
Boris was at the end.

2649
02:48:38,450 --> 02:48:48,050
end of the chain had he refused to take the salami on board
the plan would have not worked out mmm should Boris get

2650
02:48:48,050 --> 02:48:58,310
arrested no maybe he didn't even realize what was happening
I think he did I don't think he's that dumb maybe he is

2651
02:48:58,310 --> 02:49:07,070
someone all right I've made up my mind wait what about the
penguin though wait I will report to the state police we're

2652
02:49:07,070 --> 02:49:10,690
only arresting Sophie this is so backwards

2653
02:49:13,730 --> 02:49:14,790
this is

2654
02:49:29,930 --> 02:49:34,610
the person who was kidnapped the only person who wanted to
turn themselves in

2655
02:49:38,940 --> 02:49:48,520
Sophie what is this if I had known that calling the duck
detective would result in this I would have never done it

2656
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:57,160
you were supposed to find out who stole my lunch i did i
told you my best friend of smuggling i did i did do i did do

2657
02:49:57,160 --> 02:50:07,100
that oh no she's crying again i know this was a bad idea
from the beginning this is so ducked up why the forest have

2658
02:50:07,100 --> 02:50:17,400
to lose the bag my god he is such an idiot i had no idea it
was that important

2659
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:22,640
Oh, you see, he didn't know.

2660
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:24,820
You said your cousin was ill.

2661
02:50:26,340 --> 02:50:26,580
Oh.

2662
02:50:27,500 --> 02:50:31,360
And the only thing that would make her happy was the
salsicia salamis.

2663
02:50:31,860 --> 02:50:32,100
Oh.

2664
02:50:33,480 --> 02:50:35,980
Oh, I should have known.

2665
02:50:37,260 --> 02:50:39,660
If you're stupid enough to believe that...

2666
02:50:39,660 --> 02:50:40,000
You know what?

2667
02:50:40,080 --> 02:50:41,340
Yeah, jail for Sophie.

2668
02:50:41,480 --> 02:50:42,620
Jail, jail, jail.

2669
02:50:43,140 --> 02:50:48,540
Then you're also too stupid to bring a couple sausages
across the border.

2670
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:49,200
You know what?

2671
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:49,760
I don't...

2672
02:50:49,760 --> 02:50:50,100
I don't...

2673
02:50:50,100 --> 02:50:50,860
Jail!

2674
02:50:51,220 --> 02:50:51,400
Jail!

2675
02:50:56,870 --> 02:50:59,490
You only let the bear off because he's here right now.

2676
02:51:00,010 --> 02:51:00,010
No!

2677
02:51:01,790 --> 02:51:05,890
Wow, you really did quack the case, Mr. Duck Detective.

2678
02:51:06,210 --> 02:51:07,590
Why'd you have to say it like that?

2679
02:51:07,670 --> 02:51:09,370
You're just as cool as I imagined.

2680
02:51:09,530 --> 02:51:10,210
Oh, he liked it.

2681
02:51:10,290 --> 02:51:10,390
Okay.

2682
02:51:10,430 --> 02:51:11,330
Not now, Freddersen.

2683
02:51:12,090 --> 02:51:13,210
I quack the case.

2684
02:51:13,710 --> 02:51:15,390
Saw the mystery of the secret salami.

2685
02:51:16,130 --> 02:51:17,010
I got an achievement.

2686
02:51:18,510 --> 02:51:19,410
The truth.

2687
02:51:20,230 --> 02:51:22,410
The truth is another.

2688
02:51:22,430 --> 02:51:35,490
mistress but it is my duty oh my god Manfred was in the back
smiling about it of lady justice

2689
02:51:49,140 --> 02:51:58,790
I'm the two percent I can't

2690
02:52:05,150 --> 02:52:13,310
oh my god oh

2691
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:39,280
god my minutes hold on I think they're messaging me oh gosh
I can't believe this is probably 99% before this run 2% it

2692
02:52:39,280 --> 02:52:49,240
is the mint way all right I can't believe we are so vastly
wrong

2693
02:52:54,690 --> 02:52:56,570
Oh my gosh.

2694
02:52:57,210 --> 02:52:59,290
My ways are unconventional, everybody.

2695
02:53:01,350 --> 02:53:03,490
My Oshie is in the 2%.

2696
02:53:05,270 --> 02:53:06,910
Well, you know what?

2697
02:53:07,490 --> 02:53:08,170
Probably.

2698
02:53:09,630 --> 02:53:14,690
Probably any other playthrough you'll watch has Manfred
getting arrested.

2699
02:53:14,950 --> 02:53:17,390
So our playthrough is unique.

2700
02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:27,850
Thank you for the five gifts.

2701
02:53:29,850 --> 02:53:32,810
Oh gosh, thank you for ducking good time.

2702
02:53:32,990 --> 02:53:37,090
Eugene might not be a Colombo, but he's still a good egg.

2703
02:53:40,510 --> 02:53:41,530
Oh my goodness.

2704
02:53:48,580 --> 02:53:49,740
I love you.

2705
02:53:49,860 --> 02:53:51,140
I'm so...

2706
02:53:53,660 --> 02:53:55,900
The real free thinker, right?

2707
02:53:56,660 --> 02:53:59,660
I'm gonna recommend this just to do this.

2708
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:15,520
I can't believe nothing happened to him or her oh gosh I'm
crying this is why we love you so much I don't know why

2709
02:54:15,520 --> 02:54:24,320
you're like this but please never change I think it was the
fact that it was so overwhelmingly if it were like even 90%

2710
02:54:24,320 --> 02:54:31,340
I don't think I would feel so but the fact that 8% is
insane.

2711
02:54:32,320 --> 02:54:33,740
One more thing.

2712
02:54:36,320 --> 02:54:36,460
Oh.

2713
02:54:37,300 --> 02:54:38,340
Oh, gosh.

2714
02:54:39,780 --> 02:54:40,860
Oh, crap.

2715
02:54:41,120 --> 02:54:43,600
Also, shout out to all the voice actors and actresses.

2716
02:54:43,700 --> 02:54:44,540
It did amazing.

2717
02:54:45,120 --> 02:54:47,860
I completely forgot to collect my payment from Laura.

2718
02:54:47,980 --> 02:54:48,480
Oh, no.

2719
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:50,180
Everybody already went home.

2720
02:54:50,420 --> 02:54:51,960
Wait, we can't, we don't have...

2721
02:54:51,960 --> 02:54:53,820
How am I going to pay for the bus?

2722
02:54:53,960 --> 02:54:54,600
Oh, no.

2723
02:54:55,520 --> 02:54:57,160
Guess I'm walking home.

2724
02:54:58,600 --> 02:54:59,440
Here I go.

2725
02:55:00,940 --> 02:55:01,720
Oh, Freddy!

2726
02:55:02,180 --> 02:55:02,280
Ahem.

2727
02:55:02,960 --> 02:55:04,140
Need a ride?

2728
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:06,060
I just booked this one.

2729
02:55:06,520 --> 02:55:08,420
It's been such a long day after all.

2730
02:55:09,360 --> 02:55:11,340
Nobody else does it like my Kamiyoshi y'all.

2731
02:55:12,580 --> 02:55:13,920
No, thank you.

2732
02:55:14,860 --> 02:55:16,920
If Freddy knows where we live, he'll definitely stalk us.

2733
02:55:17,140 --> 02:55:18,080
Come on, it'll be fun!

2734
02:55:18,880 --> 02:55:21,720
Plus, you must be tired after all the detective work.

2735
02:55:21,840 --> 02:55:24,920
I wonder if there will be a sequel and Freddy will be our
assistant in the sequel.

2736
02:55:25,060 --> 02:55:25,760
I really don't.

2737
02:55:26,500 --> 02:55:26,940
Please?

2738
02:55:34,680 --> 02:55:41,600
I'm sure even the VA in the chat couldn't believe he walked
great great now I finally have time to tell you all about my

2739
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:50,740
ideas for your social media oh no please don't I could get
you tons of publicity oh yeah Freddie my manager desperately

2740
02:55:50,740 --> 02:55:58,600
need an LA noir playthrough now please please usually when I
play Kim's like that people get mad at me in the comments

2741
02:55:58,600 --> 02:56:04,820
they're just like why is she doing everything wrong why is
she such a villain and I'm like You don't give me the option

2742
02:56:04,820 --> 02:56:08,320
to be the villain if you don't want me to be the villain.

2743
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:18,400
And imagine we can team up.

2744
02:56:19,060 --> 02:56:19,660
Absolutely not.

2745
02:56:20,220 --> 02:56:21,960
And I can be your sidekick.

2746
02:56:22,240 --> 02:56:23,980
Oh, Freddy's kind of cute.

2747
02:56:24,940 --> 02:56:27,100
I know why VTuber.

2748
02:56:28,520 --> 02:56:29,680
Oh, man.

2749
02:56:29,940 --> 02:56:30,920
The end.

2750
02:56:34,340 --> 02:56:36,000
And just in time for my meeting.

2751
02:56:36,480 --> 02:56:36,480
Perfect.

2752
02:56:37,160 --> 02:56:38,580
I have to pee so bad, though.

2753
02:56:38,700 --> 02:56:40,440
Oh, my gosh, I've had to pee for like the past half hour.

2754
02:56:41,440 --> 02:56:43,820
Thank you, guys, for joining me for Duck Detective.

2755
02:56:44,080 --> 02:56:45,780
If there's a sequel, I will play it.

2756
02:56:45,840 --> 02:56:46,820
This is so much fun.

2757
02:56:47,980 --> 02:56:57,620
Sorry for kind of skewing the polls a little bit in terms of
Manfred walking free, but it was great.

2758
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:02,740
Baldur's Gate 3 Evil Playthrough.

2759
02:57:03,920 --> 02:57:05,260
I would do something like that.

2760
02:57:05,380 --> 02:57:08,020
I think Baldur's Gate is just way too long, you know?

2761
02:57:08,460 --> 02:57:09,580
So, um.

2762
02:57:10,760 --> 02:57:21,380
But yeah, I really thought something was going to happen to
the penguin and the, and the sheep lady, but nothing.

2763
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:26,860
I guess, you know, justice can't always be served.

2764
02:57:27,580 --> 02:57:29,320
I didn't know my Oshi was a bad girl.

2765
02:57:31,020 --> 02:57:37,660
Oh, I would stick around and talk more with you guys, gotta
go, so thank you so much for joining me today, even though I

2766
02:57:37,660 --> 02:57:51,300
was a little silly to hear pero I'm sorry, I was so stupid
during that one part but uh we got the rest of it I got the

2767
02:57:51,300 --> 02:57:58,880
rest of it with my big brain I just took a, there was like
a, there was a salami stuck in my brain cogs, okay?

2768
02:57:59,460 --> 02:58:02,460
Anyway thank you guys!

2769
02:58:02,760 --> 02:58:03,500
Have a great night.

2770
02:58:03,600 --> 02:58:03,740
Oh!

2771
02:58:03,920 --> 02:58:05,460
I can show you.

2772
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:08,660
Tomorrow.

2773
02:58:08,920 --> 02:58:10,000
I did make a schedule.

2774
02:58:10,140 --> 02:58:10,940
I got to post it.

2775
02:58:11,240 --> 02:58:13,200
I will post it after my meeting, most likely.

2776
02:58:13,620 --> 02:58:14,860
I think this is going to be really big.

2777
02:58:15,040 --> 02:58:16,120
Oh, no, it's perfect size.

2778
02:58:16,500 --> 02:58:19,400
So tomorrow, I will be doing a VR chat stream.

2779
02:58:20,240 --> 02:58:22,480
So, but we'll be hanging out in VR.

2780
02:58:22,600 --> 02:58:24,880
I'll be in full body VR.

2781
02:58:25,220 --> 02:58:27,000
So you can see me wiggle and squiggle.

2782
02:58:28,740 --> 02:58:30,080
And so we'll do that tomorrow.

2783
02:58:30,800 --> 02:58:32,540
And then afterwards, we'll be off Kai.

2784
02:58:33,920 --> 02:58:41,660
Sunday, I'll be heading off to Japan, so my schedule will be
a little inconsistent from Sunday, but I will be still

2785
02:58:41,660 --> 02:58:50,960
streaming from Japan, that is the plan, I bought a bunch of
stuff for it, so I, oh, and tomorrow I will be doing a test

2786
02:58:50,960 --> 02:58:58,760
stream of my laptop, and hopefully everything will work out,
I love you, please never change, thank you, thank you guys

2787
02:58:58,760 --> 02:59:06,060
so much, I will see you tomorrow for a wiggly, squiggly
time, and yeah, Otsumito!

2788
02:59:06,060 --> 02:59:08,560
Otsubasten Otsu Dark Detective!

2789
02:59:09,060 --> 02:59:11,320
Thank you guys, thank you so much, this is so much fun.

2790
02:59:11,800 --> 02:59:13,920
Bye bye, bye, bye bye, see you!
