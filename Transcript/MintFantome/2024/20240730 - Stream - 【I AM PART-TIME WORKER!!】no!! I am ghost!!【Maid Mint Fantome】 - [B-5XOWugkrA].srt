00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,420
Welcome back, master and lady!

2
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,680
Hello everybody!

3
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,940
Welcome to...

4
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,700
I am part-time worker!

5
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,380
I just noticed the crowbar.

6
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,980
Oh, I thought that was a gun.

7
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,340
No, I think it's a checkout thing.

8
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,800
Part-time maid.

9
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,040
No!

10
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,860
Full-time maid.

11
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,480
Part-time worker.

12
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,080
Full-time ghost.

13
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,340
Scan gun.

14
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,240
Half-life crowbar.

15
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,800
Yeah.

16
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,660
Hello Minty Fresh.

17
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,260
Hello!

18
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,740
I'm ready to watch part-time workery.

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,040
You should probably go to sleep.

20
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,160
Good morning!

21
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,400
Good morning!

22
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,980
Wow, the voice.

23
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:39,620
This is crazy.

24
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:42,580
Welcome.

25
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,120
I thought this was a super chat.

26
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,120
I thought you were wrong.

27
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,680
It's an ad for Ponti's Pizza.

28
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,460
That's a throwback.

29
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,340
That's a throwback.

30
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,380
No way.

31
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,680
Me cheese fries.

32
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,480
Part-time crowbar.

33
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,220
What if it's not a crowbar all the time?

34
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,780
What is it?

35
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,040
The other half of the time.

36
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,060
If not a crowbar all the time.

37
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,430
Wait, hold on.

38
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,550
Okay, nevermind.

39
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,210
A noodle.

40
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,890
Just a bar?

41
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,510
Just a bar.

42
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,570
A bar crow.

43
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,710
A bounty hunter?

44
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,330
Anyway,

45
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,850
I don't know much about this game.

46
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,930
I've seen like minimal clips from it.

47
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,590
In this game, you're living your grocery dreams.

48
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,930
And this is truly...

49
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,170
Now I'll be able to find out if I...

50
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,290
If being a grocer was my calling.

51
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,690
Working at a grocery store?

52
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,850
I mean, this is a conbini.

53
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,490
But it could have been my calling.

54
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,010
And I could have maybe lost out on the opportunity.

55
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:07,530
You know?

56
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,710
I don't know.

57
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,210
Dear ghost of the maid cafe, please haunt this conbini.

58
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,330
Amen.

59
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,450
Oddballboy thanks for the vibe gifted.

60
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,610
Ryan was fired last night.

61
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,570
Now he's like, I don't know.

62
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,650
He's a part-time cashier.

63
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,510
We'll see for sure.

64
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,050
Yeah.

65
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,250
I could have been a natural.

66
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,950
Did you see me?

67
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,390
Did you see me at the...

68
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,670
At the under...

69
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,530
Behind the counter?

70
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,270
And then I'd just be like...

71
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,770
Yoroshimase.

72
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,730
If I...

73
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,830
Well, actually, I was gonna say...

74
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,030
You know...

75
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,670
In a...

76
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,330
It's so funny.

77
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,030
Like at...

78
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,970
Some stores in Japan...

79
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,710
The girls...

80
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,770
The girls like...

81
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,550
Take the...

82
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,490
If you think of a nasally voice...

83
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:50,550
You know...

84
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,690
Just...

85
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,010
Crank it like...

86
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,050
Another...

87
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,010
Times ten.

88
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,650
And that's what they sound like.

89
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,450
Famichikiyokudasai.

90
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,350
Hai.

91
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,590
Kashi komarimashita.

92
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,030
But like...

93
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,290
So if you go...

94
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,250
It's really like the trendy kind of places.

95
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,550
I say like...

96
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,650
Ichimaru-kyu.

97
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,910
Like Shibuya 109.

98
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,030
You'll like go around there and they'll be like...

99
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,770
Irashimase.

100
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,510
Gorankudasai-masen.

101
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,530
You're welcome.

102
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,270
Like exactly like that.

103
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,530
Gochupansei no hafuneis.

104
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,390
That's exactly like what they sound like.

105
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,970
How immersive.

106
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,920
So...

107
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,500
I don't know why they do it.

108
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,380
I don't know why it's like a...

109
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,520
Why...

110
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,980
That's like the...

111
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,560
Fashion girly voice.

112
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,740
Anyway.

113
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,160
DLC voice pack.

114
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,280
Anyway.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,920
Let's play.

116
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,720
There's stories to this?

117
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,800
Ho ho ho.

118
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,520
Looking forward to your customer service stream today.

119
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,600
Oh.

120
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,920
Customer Johnson.

121
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,840
Yes.

122
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,440
You would know customer service, wouldn't you?

123
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,800
Best of luck on Dressina.

124
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,880
Thank you.

125
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,860
I don't think I'll say anything.

126
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,640
I'm not sure if I'll still be streaming when she comes out.

127
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,080
But just in case, if anybody plays Blue Archive...

128
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:40,020
If I'm still streaming when Dressina is released on Blue Archive, please let me know.

129
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,780
And I will.

130
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,800
I will roll for her on stream.

131
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,200
I'm so excited.

132
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,900
Will do.

133
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,540
Okay.

134
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:49,840
Okay.

135
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,080
Okay.

136
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,740
I got into Blue Archive because of you?

137
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:52,840
I'm so excited.

138
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,080
Do you like it?

139
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,020
It's actually such a good story, even.

140
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,600
Hyper Miracle...

141
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,860
Hyper Miracle Positive Girl.

142
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,100
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

143
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,280
Are you part-time workerman?

144
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,860
I don't know what the class of...

145
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,340
I'm a...

146
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,760
I'm a...

147
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,520
I'm a...

148
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,820
I'm a girl boss.

149
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,680
I'm my own boss.

150
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,380
Oh my gosh.

151
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,840
I wonder if there's like VTuber MLMs.

152
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,500
Where I can be like, hey, girly.

153
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,080
Hey, girly.

154
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,240
Hey, girly.

155
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,280
Hey, girly.

156
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,360
Hey, girly.

157
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,380
Hey, girly.

158
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,900
Do you want to become your own boss?

159
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,860
Do you want to work your own hours?

160
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,720
Join my company.

161
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,280
Obviously.

162
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,340
SCAM?

163
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,660
Oh.

164
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,200
Society...

165
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,300
Can...

166
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,640
Always make it.

167
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,600
No.

168
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,720
Hmm.

169
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,500
I'm so excited.

170
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,300
I'm so excited.

171
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,320
I'm so excited.

172
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,360
I need to work this.

173
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,700
I need to workshop this.

174
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,680
Pyramids...

175
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,760
Pyramids Scheme?

176
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,080
No, no, no.

177
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,640
We're in Infinity Scheme.

178
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,440
We're in Infinity Scheme.

179
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,560
Autosdenty, thank you for the 5 gifted.

180
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,260
Thank you so much.

181
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,060
Can I have a Karage-kun red, please?

182
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,560
Karage-kun.

183
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,300
The way you are working, you certainly seem like a warlord.

184
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,080
A one -woman company.

185
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,060
Is that a good thing?

186
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,140
Did you see that Oshinoko is getting a live-action series on Amazon Prime?

187
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,680
Yes!

188
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,440
I did see that because one of my...

189
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,320
Well, she's not an idol anymore but I really love her.

190
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,220
Her name is Ano-chan.

191
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,640
She'll be playing Memcho.

192
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,920
She plays Memcho.

193
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,680
And I remember when Ano, she dyed her hair blonde.

194
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,900
And I was like, what are you doing?

195
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:55,940
Why?

196
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,900
Why did you do this?

197
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,560
And then I was like, oh, it's for Memcho.

198
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,100
Okay, I'm not mad anymore.

199
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,060
I was like, no!

200
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,660
Because she's always had iconic black hair bob and it was so...

201
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,860
It's so cute.

202
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,220
And then she went blonde and I was like, no!

203
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,580
Of course, I still supported her through it but I was secretly a hater.

204
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,500
Toxic fan.

205
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,060
Spookily changing anonymous mooks?

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,380
What's that?

207
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,220
Minto, don't eat all the jellies in the store.

208
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,000
You can't.

209
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,280
Okay, I won't eat all the jellies.

210
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,000
Love you, Minto.

211
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,680
Thanks for the stream today.

212
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,220
Thank you!

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,940
Thank you for the super chat.

214
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,860
We would support Minto if you went blonde too.

215
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,560
You wouldn't.

216
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,140
She stops being an idol to pretend to be an idol on Amazon TV?

217
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,280
Yes.

218
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,720
Shall we get started?

219
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:01,920
Prologue.

220
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,260
I'm a part-time worker!

221
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,400
I like the music so much.

222
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,220
Ippatsu!

223
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,840
My name is Ippatsu.

224
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,020
I'm just an ordinary civilian.

225
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,840
I recently moved to the city.

226
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,740
Ichigeki.

227
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,400
I heard that it is generally unsafe and that many residents are a bit... a little bit confrontational.

228
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,680
Gyaru Minto.

229
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,080
Mint Pots.

230
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,320
Not to be confused with...

231
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,460
Mint Pants.

232
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,900
Today is my first day of part-time work.

233
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,920
I have to go now, so I won't be late.

234
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,140
Day 0, part-time mint.

235
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,780
Day 1, jobless mint.

236
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,940
The job location is just past the downtown core.

237
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,420
Okay.

238
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:48,920
Whoa.

239
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,960
Whoa, I'm headed to work.

240
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,240
Is this a horse?

241
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,900
Is this a horror game, secretly?

242
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:55,780
Oh.

243
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,660
What the?

244
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,820
Why is running weird?

245
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,980
I'm holding down shift, but nothing's working.

246
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,740
The sensitivity is... I wonder if I can turn it down.

247
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,540
Oh, there we go, there we go, there we go.

248
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,680
Sushi!

249
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,200
Is my work down this really spooky place?

250
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,600
I hope not.

251
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,720
Okay, good.

252
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh.

253
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,000
Oh, it's bustling.

254
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,540
Okay, hold on.

255
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Let me see if I can turn...

256
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,540
Oh, sensitivity.

257
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,100
Here we go.

258
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,500
Maybe, like, this much.

259
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,480
Why is there double music?

260
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,900
Oh, that's so much better, I think.

261
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,120
Oh, this is why young people lose days.

262
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,580
Damn it, shut up!

263
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,360
Hey, hey, hey, now.

264
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,800
Oh gosh, I'm getting, like, chill-as-art vibes from this.

265
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,520
Am I in the red light district?

266
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,120
Oh!

267
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,260
Oh my god, he's drunk!

268
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,400
I feel great.

269
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,580
Never mind, he's great!

270
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,960
Okay.

271
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,120
Okay.

272
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,060
He's feeling good.

273
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,140
He's feeling himself.

274
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,570
Oh, Okonomiyaki.

275
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,330
I don't know the last time I had Okonomiyaki.

276
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,350
I can't even read that.

277
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,290
Would you recognize the red light district?

278
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,070
Um, I've been, well...

279
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,430
I've accidentally walked into, like, a street of love hotels once before.

280
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,530
This guy's hair!

281
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,770
What is going on?

282
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,710
It's like he's, his hair is alive!

283
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,690
It's like it's got little, it's made of bugs.

284
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,570
You know, oh my gosh, you know those, um...

285
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,270
Kazuma Kiryu is somewhere around here, true.

286
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,270
Oh gosh, Kabukicho.

287
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,490
Um, it was on accident!

288
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,150
I swear!

289
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,150
I swear!

290
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:13,530
Do you guys know those, like, toys that are, like, it's little magnet pieces that you move around and, like, you give little characters beards and hair and mustaches and stuff like that?

291
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,030
That's what his hair looks like to me.

292
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,750
Wooly Willy!

293
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,290
Is that his name?

294
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,330
Not actually, oh gosh, this guy is...

295
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,190
I don't think he needs help at all.

296
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,570
I want what he's got.

297
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,710
Oh man.

298
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,750
Oh god!

299
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,570
I'm in, oh god!

300
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,110
Oh man.

301
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,410
We can see from his perspective.

302
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,390
Oh man.

303
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,450
Wait, hold on.

304
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,600
Oh man.

305
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,500
Oh man.

306
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,880
Wait, why do I have to be, like...

307
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,960
There we go.

308
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,560
Oh man.

309
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,820
Oh, sorry.

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,560
Every time I, like, go out of the game.

311
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,820
Every time I...

312
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,840
Oh man.

313
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,960
Lots of Okonomiyaki around here.

314
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,020
Oh, new person.

315
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,740
Hello, hello, hello.

316
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,220
Wait, are you not from Exit 8?

317
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:30,660
Or...

318
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,920
Yes, isn't this the guy from Exit 8?

319
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,960
I swear!

320
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,020
But he has hair this time.

321
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,780
This place is wild and...

322
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:48,920
Wait!

323
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,980
Oh, this is the guy from earlier!

324
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,440
Oh, I don't...

325
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,420
He still feels great, though.

326
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,880
Oh my god.

327
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:58,880
Okay.

328
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,200
I also...

329
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,780
I should get to work.

330
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,060
I should go to work.

331
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,000
He still feels great.

332
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,400
He's living his best life.

333
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,640
Let me know how the audio is, by the way.

334
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,680
If it's okay.

335
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,120
Oh!

336
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,780
Loading.

337
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,440
This is the convenience store where I will start working part-time.

338
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,740
I have to go say hello to the manager first.

339
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,380
Okay.

340
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,340
Okay.

341
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,400
Okay.

342
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,000
This is supposed to be...

343
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,120
Shinjuku.

344
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,020
It's just a little messed up.

345
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,380
It's Florida.

346
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,100
Oh, okay.

347
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,940
Um, hello.

348
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,460
Oh, it's you.

349
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,380
I'm looking forward to working with you.

350
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,560
Oh my god.

351
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,320
My coworker is not okay.

352
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,140
Yes, I'll do my best.

353
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,660
No customers are here yet.

354
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,640
So you can take a look inside the convenience store before you start your work.

355
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,780
When you're ready, take your position.

356
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,260
Okay.

357
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,440
Guys, his hair...

358
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,940
His hair is really greased down.

359
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,500
Okay.

360
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,120
We're looking around, everybody.

361
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,360
Oh.

362
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,680
We have our hair...

363
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,080
Hairstyle.

364
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,360
Hair...

365
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:24,460
Hair stuff.

366
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,360
Wow.

367
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,660
Toilet paper.

368
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,380
We got...

369
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:29,680
Wait.

370
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,480
I think this is actually the...

371
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,240
Like, very close to the brand that I actually wear.

372
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,080
Because they're the only ones that...

373
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,740
The pink ones are the only ones that fit me.

374
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,180
That's so funny.

375
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,880
Adios.

376
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,100
Okay.

377
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,540
Thank you.

378
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,240
More hair stuff.

379
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,160
Cute.

380
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,560
Okay.

381
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,020
What magazines do we have?

382
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,360
Cosgal?

383
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,120
Oh.

384
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,360
Cosgal.

385
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,360
Wow.

386
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:56,640
Okay.

387
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,140
Neko Gumi.

388
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,500
Okay.

389
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,860
Neru Neko.

390
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,740
I'd buy every one of those.

391
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,440
So cute.

392
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,620
Okay.

393
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,200
Oh.

394
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,580
We got manga and everything too.

395
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,060
Alright.

396
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,580
Where's the adult section?

397
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,600
Literally, like, right in here.

398
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,820
It's where they usually sell Playboy and stuff.

399
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,080
As well.

400
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,780
Oh.

401
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,960
This is the restroom.

402
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,360
Oh.

403
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,360
All is well.

404
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,760
I'm getting...

405
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,200
I feel like I'm in a Chilla's Art game.

406
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,840
I'm not gonna lie.

407
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,560
I'm a little scared that it's gonna turn bad on me.

408
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,020
Coffee.

409
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,180
Snacks.

410
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,620
Oh no.

411
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,120
I mean tea.

412
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,180
Hit.

413
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:44,520
Hit.

414
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,620
What are these?

415
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,480
Oh.

416
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,100
It's energy.

417
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,100
Jelly.

418
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,360
Jelly.

419
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,600
I'll take...

420
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,840
What is Akashi's flavor?

421
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,340
Anyway...

422
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,320
Wasabi flavored potato chips.

423
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,540
Lots of snacks.

424
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,480
What's these ones?

425
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,140
Oh.

426
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,860
Just health stuff.

427
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,460
What's in here?

428
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:21,820
Oh.

429
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,500
Ice cream.

430
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,140
Oh yeah.

431
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,400
Here.

432
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,420
This is so nice.

433
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,540
Best Zero!

434
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,200
Karubito.

435
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,840
Love that.

436
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,460
Vivicorn, thanks for the gifted!

437
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,580
Okay.

438
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,860
Oh wait, what's in here?

439
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,040
More ice cream?

440
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,560
Nice.

441
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,720
They're stocked.

442
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,500
This is the easiest job ever.

443
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,340
Everything is already so stocked.

444
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,320
We'll be fine.

445
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,320
Oh, what have we got?

446
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,200
Bananas, apples...

447
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,620
Egg...

448
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,780
Some bento...

449
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,040
Sandwich!

450
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,920
I love tamago sandal.

451
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,380
Some onigiri.

452
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,920
Hell yeah.

453
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,800
My favorite?

454
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,320
I don't remember which place it is.

455
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,200
But it's a tamago... it's an egg sandwich with...

456
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,140
But it also has...

457
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,140
Ham and cucumber.

458
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,120
It's my favorite thing ever.

459
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,660
I don't remember which one it was.

460
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,620
Maybe it was Family Mart.

461
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,260
Lucky, I think I'm... Oh, get into position.

462
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,160
What about the oden?

463
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,340
Oh, it's just...

464
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,420
It's just a big old...

465
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,840
Okay, there's not much... I mean, there's a lot going on in there.

466
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,580
Wait, hold on.

467
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,080
I'm not ready yet.

468
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,600
I gotta meet my coworker.

469
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,100
Oh!

470
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,480
Nina!

471
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,560
Nina!

472
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,240
I guess you're the new part-timer.

473
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,140
I'm done for today, but it's nice to meet you.

474
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:04,920
Yes.

475
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,140
Nice to meet you too.

476
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,480
Do they allow miniskirts at work?

477
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,960
Okay.

478
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
It'll be a tough job, but good luck.

479
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,180
Okay.

480
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,420
I like this guy.

481
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,680
I like this guy.

482
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,280
I like this guy.

483
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,220
I like this guy.

484
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,460
I like this guy.

485
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,880
I swear, I think this is the same exact layout as the konbini.

486
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,200
I mean, I know it's like konbini is like, you know...

487
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,500
Oh, I forgot the back room too.

488
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,480
Don't smile at me like that.

489
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,100
He looks like a Ken doll.

490
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,080
Why is one of it... I think he...

491
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,480
Oh my god, he's just so shiny.

492
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh my god.

493
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,040
Oh my god.

494
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,540
He uses the most amount of gel.

495
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,670
I'm about to look in here.

496
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,250
I think this is the exact layout of the one konbini store.

497
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,850
Oh, was there...

498
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,270
Did I imagine seeing something over here?

499
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,350
Okay.

500
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,550
The Chela's Art game.

501
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,270
But like I said, I know it's like...

502
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,090
Konbini...

503
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,470
Konbini stores are pretty similar, you know, but...

504
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,750
Thank you for your hard work!

505
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:22,950
Oh my gosh.

506
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,350
Just stormed out of there.

507
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,710
Good night!

508
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,030
Thank you for your hard work!

509
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,710
Thank you for your hard work!

510
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,990
I'll leave you to your cashier duties.

511
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,930
Actually, I've got some important things to take care of.

512
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,130
But I have not been trained!

513
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,530
I'm sorry, but you'll have to take care of things on your own.

514
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,390
But I haven't been...

515
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,870
I'm going to be on my own for my first day?

516
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,370
Don't worry.

517
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,590
It's a simple job.

518
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,630
I'll give you instructions over the phone.

519
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,810
So take it easy.

520
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,570
Alright then.

521
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,930
Please take care of everything.

522
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,370
Oh no!

523
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,010
Manager-san!

524
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,350
Where are you going though?

525
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,890
Where are you going?

526
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,070
Oh.

527
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,110
I must protect it.

528
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,610
Wait, what is he protecting?

529
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,670
What is he protecting?

530
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,130
Huh?

531
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,450
What do you mean by that?

532
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,030
Huh?

533
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:16,690
Huh?

534
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:17,990
Karaoke?

535
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,070
Karaoke?

536
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,510
There he goes.

537
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,710
I'm stuck by an invisible wall.

538
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,510
Well, there's stuff out here too.

539
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,990
Coin lockers...

540
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,230
Oh!

541
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:31,810
Oh!

542
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:32,350
Oh!

543
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,190
How do I answer the phone?

544
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,270
How do I...

545
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,470
Oh!

546
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,650
Chocolate sauce on his head.

547
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,670
Can you hear me?

548
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,390
First, hold the item scanner in your hand.

549
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,970
When the customer brings an item to you, scan it with the mouse.

550
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:48,290
The scanner.

551
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,430
Pretty simple, huh?

552
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:50,690
Okay.

553
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,170
Scan.

554
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,810
Nobody's here though, right?

555
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:57,770
What's up, Min?

556
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,630
Good luck with the new job.

557
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,730
Hopefully nothing weird happens.

558
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,170
Scan.

559
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:03,670
Oh!

560
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,250
Oh!

561
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:05,690
Okay.

562
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,630
That's how I scan stuff.

563
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,090
Okay.

564
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,550
I like lunge it.

565
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,230
Oh my god!

566
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,950
Every time Min says, did I see something, I remember something.

567
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,090
I remember the egg in Outer Wilds.

568
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,190
Welcome!

569
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,540
This guy looks normal.

570
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,840
Ping pong.

571
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,240
Oh my goodness.

572
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:32,500
Okay.

573
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,830
You're doing well.

574
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,870
Why am I still on the phone with you?

575
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,570
Working the cash register adds to the store's good rating.

576
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,170
Oh, I see.

577
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:51,250
Oh.

578
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,210
My stocking.

579
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,850
I mean, monitoring work is going well here as well.

580
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,960
Now let's deal with the troublesome customers.

581
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,280
Equip a weapon and beat them up?

582
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,560
It says...

583
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,180
That's what it says!

584
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,580
It's not just me!

585
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,460
I get to attack people?

586
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,180
Oh, that's what the crowbar is for!

587
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,560
Who's a troublesome customer?

588
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,560
Wait, who didn't...

589
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:22,900
Oh!

590
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,140
Oh, that was me.

591
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,160
Litter!

592
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,200
Litter!

593
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,400
Any troublesome customers around?

594
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,320
Oh.

595
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,560
How are you?

596
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,520
Are you a troublesome customer?

597
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,060
This guy looks like bad news.

598
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,160
This guy looks like some bad news.

599
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,800
I'm being judgemental.

600
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,360
What are you doing?

601
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,520
What are you doing?

602
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,080
Are you trying to pick a fight?

603
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,460
Ah!

604
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,600
I'm part-time worker!

605
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,820
You're doing...

606
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,380
You're doing well.

607
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,840
I'm part-time worker!

608
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,360
Letting troublesome customers loiter adds to the store's bad rating.

609
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,420
Customers are not, in fact, always right.

610
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,000
Yes!

611
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,380
Oh my gosh, that lucky guy.

612
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,740
Everybody stand in line.

613
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,260
So beat up the troublesome ones.

614
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,360
Oh my gosh.

615
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,360
This game feels so personal.

616
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,140
I'm done with my work.

617
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,940
I'm feeling lazy.

618
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,300
I'm feeling lazy now.

619
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,380
Let's go out for a drink.

620
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,680
Is this place not 24-7?

621
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,540
Oh, just kidding.

622
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,760
Actually, I have to go because I got a call from HQ.

623
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,480
Next, use your store scan skill.

624
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,120
You'll be able to see the movements of all the troublesome customers who are hidden in seconds.

625
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,300
What?

626
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,340
You can't use that?

627
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,820
It's an essential skill for convenience store workers.

628
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,080
Meow.

629
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,320
Meow.

630
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,440
Whoa.

631
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,110
I just saw the vision.

632
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,470
Oh, this guy looks like some bad news.

633
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,830
This guy looks like bad news.

634
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,890
This guy looks like bad news.

635
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,990
This guy looks like bad news.

636
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,630
Get out!

637
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,230
I'm touching worker!

638
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,630
I don't even know what he was going to do.

639
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,790
Oh, he was smoking.

640
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,510
No smoking on the premises!

641
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,170
Looks like you've mastered store scan.

642
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,050
Now you're a full-fledged convenience store worker.

643
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,450
You've got it from here.

644
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,410
Boku arubaita!

645
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,470
This is actually how it is on the JP language setting.

646
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,710
Thank you.

647
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,790
Boku arimaita!

648
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,270
Kome fukuro.

649
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,070
I think that's the dev.

650
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,100
I'm ready.

651
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,120
I'm ready.

652
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,020
I'm ready.

653
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,600
It's taking some time.

654
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,220
Now we can start work approximately 15 minutes, approximately 30 minutes.

655
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,660
Approximately 60 minutes of work?

656
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,760
Wait, is this like real time?

657
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,620
It's like an actual hour or like a 15 minute game?

658
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,550
Yes!

659
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,350
Real time!

660
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,710
Yeah, we'll do the 60 then.

661
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,470
Work until the end of the day.

662
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,610
Okay.

663
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,010
But there were some other question mark things.

664
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,530
Hello!

665
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,450
What a peaceful quiet evening.

666
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,190
You!

667
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,320
Hello, person.

668
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,780
I think I'm just, you know...

669
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,660
I think they're fine.

670
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,760
Probably.

671
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,040
Oh, that person is jazzy.

672
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,600
Hello!

673
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,740
Hello!

674
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,480
Hello!

675
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,260
They got a nice little track going on.

676
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,600
Hello!

677
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,080
Ping pong!

678
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,200
Oh, thank you!

679
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,240
Oh, okay.

680
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,680
I'll pick that up, don't worry.

681
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,740
Don't worry.

682
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,340
Okay.

683
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,920
Bye bye!

684
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,020
What are you doing?

685
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:11,880
Are you...

686
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,560
What are you doing?

687
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,820
No loitering!

688
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,740
No loitering!

689
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,120
Oh.

690
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,100
Why is everybody throwing stuff at me?

691
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Oh my gosh, wait.

692
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,780
There's already so many people here.

693
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,700
Ah!

694
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,400
Okay.

695
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,240
Why are you...

696
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,700
What the?

697
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,080
Where did the bad people go?

698
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,480
Oh my god.

699
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,320
Stop throwing!

700
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,380
Everybody's rude!

701
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,160
Cone man!

702
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,360
Bye bye!

703
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,280
Is he actually gonna buy something?

704
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:47,720
Or...

705
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,380
Hello?

706
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,580
Beep!

707
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,320
Beep!

708
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,640
Beep!

709
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,820
Yes!

710
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,400
Yes!

711
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:56,820
Oh!

712
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,100
Nice!

713
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,660
Tits!

714
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,180
Okay.

715
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,160
Oh, this guy...

716
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,300
What do you want?

717
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,060
What do you want?

718
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,360
What are you doing?

719
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,860
Dude, you're not allowed behind here!

720
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,660
Are you being a loiterer?

721
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,340
Where is all the people?

722
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,900
What is that person doing over there?

723
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,180
What are you doing here?

724
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,560
Get out of here!

725
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,920
Oh, maybe he was fine.

726
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,040
Um...

727
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,600
I'm sweeping...

728
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,960
Just stand on him so they don't notice, you know?

729
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,160
Ping-pong!

730
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,040
Ping-pong!

731
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,740
I like how I scan this, but they don't pay.

732
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:46,700
Yeah.

733
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,740
What are you doing?

734
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,340
What are you getting?

735
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,760
Pink pants, huh?

736
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,120
Yeah?

737
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:51,920
Yeah?

738
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,700
That's right.

739
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,200
Oh, that guy is walking way too slowly.

740
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,140
Hey!

741
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,560
I am Pachai Walker!

742
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,240
No slow...

743
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,960
What the?

744
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,480
Who's laughing at me?

745
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:04,980
Um...

746
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,860
I'm coming!

747
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,240
I'm coming!

748
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:06,560
I'm coming!

749
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:06,840
I'm coming!

750
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:06,900
I'm coming!

751
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,580
I'm coming!

752
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:07,960
I'm coming!

753
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:08,840
Okay.

754
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,340
Why?

755
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,740
He was a slow...

756
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,120
I don't know.

757
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,120
He was giving me a bad vibe.

758
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,380
What's going on?

759
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,660
Wait!

760
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,680
Who's laughing at...

761
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,080
Wait!

762
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,900
We have three people!

763
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,120
Why did you just throw my...

764
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,780
Oh my god.

765
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,260
Ah!

766
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,780
I'm Pachai Walker!

767
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,700
I'm sorry.

768
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,760
Don't throw your stuff at me!

769
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,140
Rude!

770
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,120
We still have two sillies around.

771
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,480
Oh, sorry.

772
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,300
I just realized the chat is like...

773
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,500
Oh my god.

774
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,880
This guy over here!

775
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,020
Oh!

776
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,700
I'm Pachai Walker!

777
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,260
Hi!

778
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,200
Ah!

779
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,020
Go!

780
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,100
I'm Pachai Walker!

781
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,560
Why does this look like Hi Guy?

782
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,280
It won't open!

783
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,700
I'm Pachai Walker!

784
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,120
One second.

785
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,700
I'm going to move you guys over just a little... just a tad.

786
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,700
So you can see our points and stuff.

787
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,480
Yes?

788
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,260
There you go.

789
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:03,860
That should be better.

790
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,160
My apple!

791
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:06,900
Hello!

792
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,840
Sorry.

793
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,020
I'm sorry.

794
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,760
Sorry for the wait.

795
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,840
Don't worry about it.

796
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,980
That guy looks really sussy.

797
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
I'm Pachai Walker!

798
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,180
I don't know anymore.

799
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:19,500
Oops.

800
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:19,680
Sorry.

801
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,060
Hold on a second.

802
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,400
One second.

803
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:21,660
Okay.

804
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,300
Hello!

805
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:23,620
Hello!

806
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,360
Oh!

807
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:25,780
Just...

808
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,160
Oh!

809
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,460
Why...

810
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,140
Why did you shrug at me?

811
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,620
Get out of here, weirdo!

812
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,060
No running!

813
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,920
No running!

814
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,020
Get out of here!

815
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,160
No running!

816
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,340
You're in...

817
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:38,940
No running!

818
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,960
No running in my store!

819
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,440
People are stressing me out, you guys.

820
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,300
This is...

821
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,500
Okay.

822
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:46,840
Okay.

823
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:47,980
Beep.

824
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,160
Beep.

825
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,120
Thank you.

826
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,640
Pet time worker.

827
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,820
I'm Pet Time Worker!

828
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,020
Yes!

829
00:32:59,300 --> 00:32:59,560
Welcome!

830
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,260
Welcome!

831
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,020
Welcome!

832
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:04,940
Oh!

833
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,120
What's wrong?

834
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,000
Oh!

835
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,760
Are you embarrassed?

836
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,420
Maybe you should buy some water, guy.

837
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,580
All you bought is Chuhai and cola.

838
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,980
Turn it down just...

839
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,160
Oh!

840
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,140
Excuse you!

841
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,580
What?

842
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,800
What was that?

843
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,420
Did you just...

844
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,500
Did he just give me a middle finger?

845
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,760
Everybody's so rude to the part-time workers.

846
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:37,980
I'm sorry.

847
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,020
They don't know what it's like.

848
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,780
You must work...

849
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,260
I think...

850
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,000
I believe everybody should work retail, you know?

851
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,560
At least once.

852
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,900
Oh, it's an okay sign?

853
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,500
Oh, okay.

854
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,040
Hello, hello.

855
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,220
Maybe he was just like, yeah, this is the good stuff.

856
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,580
Maybe they were really impressed with the store.

857
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,340
Uh-oh.

858
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,720
That guy's hair is too yellow.

859
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,700
That guy's hair is too yellow.

860
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,400
Did you just go...

861
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,620
My bad.

862
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,200
I dropped the thing on the floor.

863
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,100
Oh!

864
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,200
I'm sorry.

865
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:07,980
I'm sorry.

866
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,440
Hello.

867
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,520
Oh, maybe he's normal.

868
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,740
Do you need hair supplies?

869
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,500
Okay.

870
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,920
Fizzy water.

871
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,700
Okay.

872
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,220
You're normal.

873
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,600
Alright, get out of here.

874
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,580
I judged him.

875
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,180
You guys, I misjudged him.

876
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,620
And I should have judged this guy because he threw all of his stuff at me.

877
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,720
I don't have to, like, restock stuff in this game, right?

878
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh, there he is.

879
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,740
There he is.

880
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:37,980
Oh, there he is.

881
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,940
There's so many people here.

882
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,640
Woah!

883
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,600
Hey!

884
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:41,800
No!

885
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,740
Matt!

886
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,740
You picked that up!

887
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,660
Oh!

888
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,180
You!

889
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,140
Your thing!

890
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:46,900
It fell in front!

891
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,440
Two more things?

892
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:48,920
What?

893
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,900
Oh my god.

894
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,100
Wait.

895
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:51,540
Where's the...

896
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,520
Where's the one more thing?

897
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,300
Oh!

898
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,520
Here!

899
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:54,940
What?

900
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,560
She's throwing on both sides.

901
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,500
Hello!

902
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,460
Irasshaimase!

903
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,760
Fukuro go ryo desu ka?

904
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,260
No!

905
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,640
Okay.

906
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:08,980
Oh!

907
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,290
What will you do for your next trick?

908
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:17,850
Wait.

909
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,230
What was that?

910
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:19,430
Ah!

911
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:20,650
Huh?

912
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,430
This guy is just trying to rob us!

913
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:24,670
Look.

914
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:28,750
You say it's heavy, but like, I got it and I screwed up.

915
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,910
I was able to take care of it with just a crowbar.

916
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:33,830
This guy is weak.

917
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,210
One more thing.

918
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,390
Oh gosh.

919
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:42,550
Oh my god.

920
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,610
There's a whole line you got.

921
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,130
He's dead?

922
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,170
I sure hope so.

923
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,490
Oh, what did you do?

924
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,130
Why is everybody, like, flashing me?

925
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,870
Uh oh.

926
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:58,390
We have a little crazy, kooky person going on.

927
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,010
Where are they?

928
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,790
Kooky person, where are you?

929
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,510
Over there?

930
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:03,810
Oh!

931
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,210
That's not my property.

932
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,070
I don't care about that.

933
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,670
I don't own the parking lot, do I?

934
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,190
What are they doing out there anyway?

935
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,670
Are you eating the dirt?

936
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,190
Earthy?

937
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,090
Why was I right?

938
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,930
Actually, what's wrong with him eating dirt?

939
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,750
That's his prerogative.

940
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,350
Look at this guy.

941
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,850
Teeny weeny here.

942
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:33,810
That's his prerogative.

943
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:34,050
Small.

944
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,490
Oh, someone's mad at me.

945
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,170
Why are you mad?

946
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,910
Is it because I took too long?

947
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,270
Eating dirt is illegal.

948
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:44,910
Oh, this guy... Hey!

949
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,370
Quick, march!

950
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,750
What a jerk!

951
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,430
I hope you choke on this gum!

952
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:53,950
Asshole!

953
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,270
Hello.

954
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,970
Thank you.

955
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,990
I called him a teeny weeny, but...

956
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,290
Short people, am I right?

957
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,410
He's actually so nice!

958
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,710
Have a good day.

959
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,290
What the?

960
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,190
Is it this guy?

961
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,030
Oh, maybe not.

962
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,730
Maybe he's just a slow walker.

963
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,890
I think I gotta get rid of our dirt eater, you guys.

964
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,730
I think I gotta get rid of the dirt eater.

965
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,230
I'm gonna whack him in the ass.

966
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,970
I am part-time worker!

967
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,630
How many points would you give me for that?

968
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,010
Where's the... Where's the other silly person?

969
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,210
It's not you, is it?

970
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,070
It's not this guy, is it?

971
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,650
Rip dirt eater.

972
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,790
Wait, where's the other one?

973
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,490
Are you stealing from me?

974
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,990
There's one more item.

975
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:53,830
Oh, here.

976
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,710
This guy!

977
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,850
What are you doing?

978
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,770
Delicious.

979
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,790
Umai, umai, umai.

980
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,030
I'm Perch, I'm Wacker!

981
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,310
Gah.

982
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,310
Yeah.

983
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,250
Oh my gosh.

984
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:10,810
Oh.

985
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,750
Everybody's really eccentric here.

986
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:14,950
Another one?

987
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,930
Everybody is troublemaker.

988
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,610
Have a good day.

989
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,510
Have a good day.

990
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,190
Oh, it's a person...

991
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,810
What is...

992
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,290
Oh, you got a lot of stuff.

993
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,250
Yeah, very good.

994
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,710
Very nice.

995
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,530
Just a normal day.

996
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:31,750
What is...

997
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,530
What's like the most eccentric...

998
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:33,870
Or like...

999
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,470
Like what's...

1000
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,630
The craziest person you have ever had come into your work before?

1001
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,110
If you like worked retail or a restaurant or anywhere.

1002
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:46,830
Thumbs up.

1003
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:47,730
Hey!

1004
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,750
This guy's a...

1005
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,910
Sorry, it took so long.

1006
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,250
Sorry.

1007
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,230
Sorry.

1008
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,430
Now we have two crazy people.

1009
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,710
Hey, what are you doing over here, man?

1010
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:00,710
Sleepy!

1011
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,190
I'm Perch, I'm Wacker!

1012
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,070
I'm Perch, I'm Wacker!

1013
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:09,810
Wait.

1014
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,570
No, that's the guy walking away.

1015
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,670
Oh, he's in the back.

1016
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,030
He's in the back.

1017
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,410
Outside.

1018
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,930
He's outside.

1019
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,570
Excuse me.

1020
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:22,830
You're here?

1021
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:23,170
Oh, you're here.

1022
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,610
What are you doing?

1023
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,330
Oh, so sitting is a crime now?

1024
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,510
This guy's just chilling.

1025
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:30,870
I'm sorry, guy.

1026
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,410
Gotta get your toesies.

1027
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:34,470
No!

1028
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,050
Feet out!

1029
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,070
I managed a GameStop for like a decade before going to school.

1030
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,470
We don't have time for all the stories.

1031
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,550
I wish I had a crowbar.

1032
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,890
The guy came in right before... what did a haggle on price?

1033
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,030
Oh my god.

1034
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,650
Wait, did you say before a blizzard?

1035
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,710
I'm still in a dream, dirt.

1036
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,430
Toes out is a crime.

1037
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,110
It is in Japan, actually.

1038
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,170
Never wear sandals in Japan.

1039
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:05,790
Oh, you're back!

1040
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,170
Oh my god.

1041
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,670
Who's laughing at me?

1042
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:11,950
Cookie.

1043
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:12,470
Oh.

1044
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,670
Look at me.

1045
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,270
Yeah, look at your face!

1046
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,670
Where is the other person?

1047
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,300
What?

1048
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,360
How is this a crime?

1049
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,180
Oh my god, she's awesome!

1050
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,280
This isn't a crime!

1051
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,620
She's a nice place to practice!

1052
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,580
This is... oh, there's... okay.

1053
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,500
You guys, our reputation is going down the drain.

1054
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,680
Oh.

1055
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,320
You?

1056
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,260
What are you... what are you doing?

1057
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,660
Stop it!

1058
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,880
Stop searching!

1059
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,180
Oh!

1060
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,760
Oh my god!

1061
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,060
Yay!

1062
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,440
Oh!

1063
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,120
Oh!

1064
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:06,660
Yeah!

1065
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,780
Yeah!

1066
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,600
Yeah!

1067
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,040
Yeah!

1068
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:14,620
Wow!

1069
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,880
Watch your fingers, sir!

1070
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,080
Oh my god!

1071
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,640
Public!

1072
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,600
This store is insane!

1073
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,880
This store is absolutely insane!

1074
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,040
Uh-oh, we have a line.

1075
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,700
People are gonna start getting mad at me.

1076
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,680
Ping-pong!

1077
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,280
Ping-pong!

1078
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:44,720
Ping-pong!

1079
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,060
I'm telling you, the way this guy is walking... he's gonna mug me!

1080
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,000
This guy's about to... I think this guy's about to...

1081
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:52,780
Oh.

1082
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,920
Oh my god!

1083
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,420
Oh my god!

1084
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:54,720
Wait!

1085
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,040
Wait!

1086
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,140
This is an actual crime!

1087
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,660
Get out of my...

1088
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:57,860
Ah!

1089
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,640
Anyway.

1090
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,680
Continue scanning.

1091
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,140
This guy once asked for pepperoni but was... did you say he was vegan?

1092
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,640
I think that lady is causing trouble.

1093
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,340
The lady in pink?

1094
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah, we'll get her.

1095
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,460
We'll get her.

1096
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,340
You?

1097
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,460
Oh my god!

1098
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
You just eat my apples!

1099
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,140
Grandma!

1100
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,460
This isn't home!

1101
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,460
I am proud of you!

1102
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,580
I'm afraid to hit the elderly!

1103
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,100
Okay.

1104
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,640
Oh, you got a lot of stuff there, buddy.

1105
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,800
This is a convenience store.

1106
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,720
Not, you know...

1107
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,120
Not your grocery store.

1108
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:40,820
Okay.

1109
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,340
All is well in the neighborhood.

1110
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,680
Rip grandma.

1111
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,360
You know what?

1112
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,100
Yeah, rip grandma.

1113
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,940
She was not cognitively there.

1114
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,660
I think she's lived enough life on this earth.

1115
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,020
This is not Aeon.

1116
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:03,880
Yeah!

1117
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,740
Thumbs up!

1118
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:05,960
Thumbs up!

1119
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,920
Oh, my bad.

1120
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,900
I was just... Oh my gosh, that guy is back there.

1121
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,460
Drinking my drinks!

1122
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,800
Hello.

1123
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,440
Hold on.

1124
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,220
One moment, please.

1125
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,680
Delicious.

1126
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,600
I'm part-time worker!

1127
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,980
So sorry about the blood.

1128
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,160
Anyway...

1129
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:26,860
Beep.

1130
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:27,680
Beep.

1131
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:29,960
Zoro?

1132
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,820
That guy?

1133
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,160
Yes.

1134
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,560
Yes.

1135
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,020
Everybody is getting noodles.

1136
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,140
Please, eat something healthier.

1137
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,660
What's wrong with this guy?

1138
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,160
Oh.

1139
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,100
Nothing is wrong with this guy.

1140
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:45,320
Okay.

1141
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,160
Maybe something... Maybe a little something is wrong with this guy.

1142
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,260
Give him a knuckle sandwich.

1143
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,520
I wish I could use my fist.

1144
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,000
The crowbar is fine, but...

1145
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,280
Sorry.

1146
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,760
I didn't realize this game would be so... Intensive.

1147
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,300
But I... Doesn't Chibi Binto have a crowbar?

1148
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,200
You're right!

1149
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,360
Uh-oh.

1150
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:08,900
We got...

1151
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,240
Oh!

1152
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:10,880
What?

1153
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,580
This is not a crime.

1154
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,340
This is a show!

1155
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:15,600
Yeah!

1156
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,100
Let her spin!

1157
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,840
I'm part-time worker!

1158
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,440
Hey!

1159
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,240
Where's the other crazy person?

1160
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:31,930
How did I miss that?

1161
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,110
Oh.

1162
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:32,710
Wait.

1163
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,210
How am I supposed to... Huh?

1164
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:37,730
Wait.

1165
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:38,130
Huh?

1166
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,450
Why were they... Oh my god!

1167
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:40,850
He's there!

1168
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,070
Wait.

1169
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,490
How am I supposed to get that other person?

1170
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,550
I am part-time worker!

1171
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:49,050
I am part-time worker!

1172
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,150
Oh!

1173
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:52,930
Oh my god!

1174
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:54,390
I'm a superhero!

1175
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:55,910
Oh my god!

1176
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:56,470
Oh my god!

1177
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,390
Oh my god!

1178
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,070
No!

1179
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,150
Get out of my store!

1180
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:00,590
I am part-time worker!

1181
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:02,590
Oh gosh!

1182
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,350
I don't think we have the insurance for this!

1183
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,170
Oh god!

1184
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:06,230
I am part-time worker!

1185
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:06,810
No!

1186
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:08,410
You know what?

1187
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:08,630
It's fine.

1188
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:09,550
Oh my god!

1189
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,490
I am part-time worker!

1190
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,250
I'm so sorry, sir.

1191
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,490
You've been waiting so patiently.

1192
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:18,370
You've been waiting so... I don't know where the other person is.

1193
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,570
I think it was really far away.

1194
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:22,230
I don't think...

1195
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,310
Oh hello, bucket.

1196
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:25,290
Hello.

1197
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,650
Why are you mad at me?

1198
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,090
Look to your left.

1199
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:34,890
This guy?

1200
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,130
Look at this body.

1201
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:38,130
Oh...

1202
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,010
All he's doing... This is not a crime.

1203
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,050
I am part-time worker!

1204
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,210
You know what?

1205
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,030
This place is...

1206
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,110
This place is like...

1207
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:51,070
So strict!

1208
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,330
This is, I guess, typical Nihon, right?

1209
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:56,870
Hello!

1210
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:58,990
Thank you for waiting.

1211
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,130
Thank you for your patience.

1212
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:00,670
Welcome.

1213
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:02,790
Yes, yes.

1214
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,570
Do you have a point card?

1215
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:06,790
Oh no.

1216
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:07,330
Okay.

1217
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:08,070
Yes, yes.

1218
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:09,790
Yes, yes.

1219
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:12,970
Do you want me to warm you up?

1220
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:15,250
Oh.

1221
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:16,090
Oh.

1222
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:16,850
Okay.

1223
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,770
Got a lot of hair...

1224
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:23,530
You bought a lot of hair stuff for someone who's literally bald.

1225
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:24,150
But okay.

1226
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:27,770
Oh my god!

1227
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:30,770
Was that you?

1228
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,190
Goodbye?

1229
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,410
What does that mean?

1230
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,610
I am part-time worker!

1231
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:37,830
What does that even mean?

1232
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:43,830
Don't shame him.

1233
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,150
Maybe he just likes how it feels on his head, you know?

1234
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,170
It's for his friend, obviously.

1235
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,970
Well, the ceiling is not fixed, but...

1236
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,590
The rubble has been cleaned up, which is pretty nice.

1237
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,510
We have someone around, and I don't know where they are.

1238
00:46:59,350 --> 00:46:59,790
Goodbye!

1239
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,870
Like, what does that mean?

1240
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,070
Oh!

1241
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,730
No exercising!

1242
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,270
I'm part-time worker!

1243
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:12,390
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1244
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:14,930
Is this...

1245
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:16,410
Oh.

1246
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,150
Wait, hold on, sir.

1247
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:21,690
Um, actually, I can't use my scan, so...

1248
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,080
Is that the person?

1249
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,520
Ew, what's that sound?

1250
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,200
Hi guy, get out of the water!

1251
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,760
I am part-time worker!

1252
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:37,800
Oh my gosh!

1253
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:41,920
Oh my gosh!

1254
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,700
Death stranding!

1255
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,680
Hold on, I think it's over here.

1256
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,120
Oh!

1257
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,440
I'm rooting for you.

1258
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,300
I love you.

1259
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,680
I love you.

1260
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,220
I...

1261
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,580
I am part-time worker!

1262
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,600
Tain, go!

1263
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,680
It's basically saying, like...

1264
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,260
Live...

1265
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,260
Live...

1266
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,040
Whoa!

1267
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,120
Wait a second.

1268
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,740
I don't think you're supposed to be...

1269
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,420
They don't know.

1270
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,320
How would they know?

1271
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,980
How would they know?

1272
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,600
They don't know.

1273
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,780
How would they know?

1274
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,080
I am part-time worker!

1275
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,800
So they did find out.

1276
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,480
You're not a part-time worker.

1277
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,160
Look out!

1278
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,740
I am part-time worker!

1279
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:44,260
Get out of my door!

1280
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,880
I am part-time worker!

1281
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:46,960
Hello.

1282
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,060
Excuse me.

1283
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,360
You've been waiting so patiently.

1284
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,640
Hmm?

1285
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:51,940
Hm?

1286
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,180
I hear other music.

1287
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,020
Oh my god!

1288
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,340
They...

1289
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,880
How is this... how is this neighborhood real?

1290
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,820
I had a video.

1291
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,480
Game store had someone move a ceiling panel to crawl into the store room.

1292
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:09,840
What?

1293
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,380
That's wild!

1294
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,520
Wait, the music is kind of beautiful.

1295
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,020
Oh my god!

1296
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,240
Is that me?

1297
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,800
Oh, sorry, sorry.

1298
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,980
There's a ghost!

1299
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,500
Who's throwing stuff now?

1300
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:31,980
That guy!

1301
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,180
Oh my god...

1302
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,360
You guys, we're in trouble.

1303
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:42,660
Hey!

1304
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,480
Hey!

1305
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,000
Are they

1306
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,880
gonna go make some mochi or something?

1307
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,200
Oh my god!

1308
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:56,720
Oh my god!

1309
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,620
Oh, he's done!

1310
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,780
He's out of here!

1311
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,140
Thing one or thing two?

1312
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,900
I am part-time worker!

1313
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,660
I am part-time worker!

1314
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,700
This is impressive!

1315
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,200
I'm part-time...

1316
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,240
Oh my god, Hanabi!

1317
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,080
It's not the 4th of July!

1318
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,600
I'm part-time worker!

1319
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,200
I'm part-time worker!

1320
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,800
Oh my god, she haunted our store!

1321
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,800
We'll let her go.

1322
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,360
She haunted our store!

1323
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,640
Don't mind the lights.

1324
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,180
It's just our president ghost.

1325
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,760
Oh, Conan's back.

1326
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,280
Oh, she's also coming back.

1327
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,200
I think she likes it here.

1328
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:58,980
If our...

1329
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,660
I mean, let's give it a try.

1330
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,100
If our...

1331
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:00,520
You know what?

1332
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,420
Honestly, a place being a haunted spot, that's like a novelty, you know?

1333
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,580
What's going on?

1334
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,620
Oh, we have an actual Karen now.

1335
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,340
Okay, hold on.

1336
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:14,820
Oh!

1337
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:15,620
Miss?

1338
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:16,800
Ma'am?

1339
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:17,660
Ma'am?

1340
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:23,700
It'll bring more customers if they know that.

1341
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:26,760
It's like people will start coming just for the novelty of it being haunted, you know?

1342
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,420
Don't we all wish we could crowbar Karens?

1343
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:33,740
Oh!

1344
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,300
I guess I have to get rid of her, don't I?

1345
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,100
It was an honor meeting you.

1346
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,960
Why are your eyes...

1347
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,420
Are you even real?

1348
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:51,960
Oh, whoops.

1349
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:52,980
I tried to scan her.

1350
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,000
What?

1351
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:54,900
I'm a ghost!

1352
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:58,660
Oh my god.

1353
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,900
You guys, we have too many...

1354
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,400
I wish I was dead.

1355
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,310
We have a guy over here.

1356
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:15,070
Bench pressing.

1357
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:20,810
What did the robot... What did the robot do?

1358
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:22,490
Uh oh.

1359
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:23,010
Wait.

1360
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,050
Who else do we have?

1361
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:27,530
Being a nuisance around here.

1362
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:28,690
Oh, you!

1363
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,450
Are you... What are you doing?

1364
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:41,210
Okay, I'll check you out.

1365
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:41,750
I'll check you out.

1366
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:46,550
We have three people?

1367
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:50,250
If you bite it, you bought it.

1368
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,530
Well, I'll check you out.

1369
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:54,410
Oh yeah.

1370
00:52:56,010 --> 00:53:01,950
Oh gosh, we're losing... We're losing... We're losing credibility points.

1371
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,990
That guy is just grilling on the street.

1372
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,670
That's... That's unsanitary!

1373
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:09,830
We'll get him.

1374
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:10,310
We'll get him.

1375
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:10,730
We'll get him.

1376
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:14,470
Hey!

1377
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:16,070
Coming through.

1378
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,170
Sam Bridges!

1379
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:22,250
Sam Bridges, I didn't get any deliveries!

1380
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,270
I'm Valentine Walker!

1381
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:28,910
The slow-mo into like the fast is so disorienting.

1382
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:29,730
I don't like it very much.

1383
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:30,830
Oh!

1384
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,850
Uh... This person's just laying on the ground.

1385
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:34,670
Oh!

1386
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:35,930
It's the thumbnail!

1387
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:37,850
I'm gonna cool you down.

1388
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,570
I am Valentine Walker!

1389
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,470
Oh my god.

1390
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:47,770
I am Part-Time Walker!

1391
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:49,950
Part-Time Wacker?

1392
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:50,770
Hey!

1393
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:51,870
What are you doing back here?

1394
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,450
I'm Part-Time Wacker!

1395
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,990
The office work.

1396
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:00,290
Yeah, this is pretty much it, you know?

1397
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:02,610
What?

1398
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,490
What do you cut down my tree for?

1399
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,810
Spray them with herbicide?

1400
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:09,030
No!

1401
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,710
The city needs trees!

1402
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,370
I am Part-Time Wacker!

1403
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:13,470
Damn.

1404
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:17,090
What are you doing?

1405
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,090
I put up a fucking flag!

1406
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,220
I can't be mad at him!

1407
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,820
I am Part-Time Wacker!

1408
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,940
I have been wondering... Damn!

1409
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,360
She's got a... a caboose!

1410
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,680
Okay, excuse me.

1411
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,900
Sorry it took so long.

1412
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,320
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1413
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,100
Yes!

1414
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:49,980
Thank you very much!

1415
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,440
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1416
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,120
Ooh!

1417
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,860
Maybe... What are you... Why are you shrugging at me?

1418
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,740
You need better... healthier habits, buddy.

1419
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,400
I am the booty.

1420
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,180
Can you blame me?

1421
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,700
Banana flavored?

1422
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:07,480
What were those?

1423
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,040
Chips?

1424
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,400
Hmm...

1425
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,080
Egg croquette?

1426
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,420
Oh my god!

1427
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,420
Uh...

1428
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,120
I'll get her in just a second.

1429
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,080
Aww...

1430
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,260
Banana chips.

1431
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,660
But they were like banana fl... I don't think they were banana chips.

1432
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,600
I think they were banana flavored chips.

1433
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,400
Jacksepticeye.

1434
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,940
Lady, I think you need a rest.

1435
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,160
Ping-pong!

1436
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,700
Oh, come on.

1437
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,180
Everybody's so rude.

1438
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,620
Everybody's so... rude.

1439
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,820
Get out of my store!

1440
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,160
I'm sure it will get a lot of attention.

1441
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,260
Nobody saw that.

1442
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:58,660
Delicious.

1443
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,460
You need to pay for that!

1444
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:03,920
Alright, guys.

1445
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,200
Oh, where are you going?

1446
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,400
You're not allowed to sit at a seat anymore!

1447
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,140
What is this?

1448
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,380
You're not allowed to sit at a seat anymore!

1449
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:13,840
You're not allowed to sit at a seat anymore!

1450
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,740
This is a dictatorship!

1451
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:15,700
I swear!

1452
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,020
You're not allowed to do anything!

1453
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,800
Don't push him.

1454
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,840
I like our skylight.

1455
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:23,640
Oh!

1456
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,500
I feel at home in this corner.

1457
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:26,500
Okay.

1458
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:28,580
Um...

1459
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,000
I don't even know what to say.

1460
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,880
You should sit, not sleep.

1461
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,060
I guess so.

1462
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:38,300
Uh-oh.

1463
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,560
That guy...

1464
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,180
That guy coming through, he's trouble.

1465
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,580
That guy is gonna be trouble.

1466
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,320
What?

1467
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,480
There's a whole car!

1468
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,380
Who's driving in?

1469
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,120
All he's doing is smoking.

1470
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:00,650
How will

1471
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,160
I financially recover from this?

1472
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:11,600
Ah!

1473
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,200
Oh.

1474
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,120
Everybody, ignore the construction.

1475
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,140
Oh my god.

1476
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,440
Ma'am, I will get with you in just one second, ma'am.

1477
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,500
Oh my god.

1478
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,120
There's two of them in a row!

1479
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:26,960
Sleepy!

1480
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,320
New door.

1481
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:31,920
Yeah.

1482
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:32,940
Just...

1483
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,080
It goes perfectly with our skylight, you know?

1484
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:35,720
Hello.

1485
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,340
Yes,

1486
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:40,840
yes.

1487
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:41,560
Thank you.

1488
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,260
Thank you for shopping here.

1489
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,560
All your money will go towards our new...

1490
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,640
Our new building.

1491
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,140
Did that guy just...

1492
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,420
That guy did not walk through the door.

1493
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,400
That guy literally walked through the hole in the wall.

1494
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,280
I see him over there.

1495
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,580
I'm not gonna let you.

1496
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,340
What are you gonna do?

1497
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,380
Make a mochi or something?

1498
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,080
I won't let you, old man.

1499
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,220
I am a part-time worker.

1500
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,940
I won't let you.

1501
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:07,800
Come out.

1502
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,400
Oh my god.

1503
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,500
I didn't make fun of you!

1504
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,320
I'm so sorry!

1505
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,360
I'm so sorry!

1506
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:15,920
I'm so sorry!

1507
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:16,140
I'm so sorry!

1508
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:16,400
I'm so sorry!

1509
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:17,420
I'm so sorry!

1510
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:17,780
Oh.

1511
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:25,520
Wait.

1512
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,700
Sorry, I had the wrong person.

1513
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,060
Oh my god.

1514
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,400
Is that guy bad or not?

1515
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,620
He's just standing there.

1516
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,260
She called me out!

1517
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,160
I'm sorry I called you!

1518
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,420
A tiny weedy...

1519
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:39,720
Oh.

1520
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,020
There he goes.

1521
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,120
I guess he didn't have...

1522
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,380
anything.

1523
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,940
You guys, I think people are getting weirder and weirder.

1524
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:55,250
We're halfway through, I think.

1525
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:57,370
No standing!

1526
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,090
What are you gonna do?

1527
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:01,750
Smash me?

1528
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,350
Don't smash my... I'm curious what he's about to do, though.

1529
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,520
He's walk... Oh.

1530
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,920
What are you about to do?

1531
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,220
Don't smash the wall.

1532
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,220
Now I have a third door.

1533
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:21,800
Sorry.

1534
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,160
Sorry, so sorry, everybody.

1535
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,420
Where's your stuff?

1536
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,500
Oh, sorry.

1537
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,580
He got really impatient.

1538
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,080
Hi!

1539
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:35,560
Oh.

1540
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,540
Where did he come from?

1541
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,060
Where did he come from?

1542
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,220
Where did he go?

1543
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,820
Where did he come from?

1544
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,400
Cotton eyes... Joe.

1545
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,840
Do you want a drink with that?

1546
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:01,980
Or...

1547
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,380
I guess penguins don't have money.

1548
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:08,480
I guess penguins don't have money.

1549
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,680
He walks with such swagger.

1550
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,560
Okay, good.

1551
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,920
I'm glad that the...

1552
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,340
Okay.

1553
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:34,030
Hello.

1554
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,480
Who's being a nuisance?

1555
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,040
Is it that old man?

1556
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,420
Oh my gosh, old people are such a nuisance.

1557
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:46,780
Oh.

1558
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:49,700
Oh, bucket.

1559
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,720
I know you can't see.

1560
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,380
It's not your fault.

1561
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:52,280
Thank you.

1562
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,040
Thank you.

1563
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,560
Matara, don't listen.

1564
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,780
Oh gosh, we're getting docked.

1565
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,340
Oh, don't be mad at me.

1566
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,060
I'm sorry.

1567
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:09,680
I'm sorry.

1568
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,600
It's my first day.

1569
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,200
It's my first day.

1570
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:14,980
Please.

1571
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:17,000
Oh.

1572
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,780
Oh my... Oh my god.

1573
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:22,780
I'm part-time worker.

1574
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,120
Not the fami-tiki.

1575
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:26,740
Wow.

1576
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,260
Hey, hey, hey.

1577
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,600
What are we wowing about?

1578
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,580
What are you doing?

1579
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,200
No running on the premises.

1580
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,020
I'm part-time worker.

1581
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,300
Oh my god.

1582
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,100
Yuru camp.

1583
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:42,640
It's warm.

1584
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,900
Shiny days.

1585
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:46,900
Atarashii kaise.

1586
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:51,450
It's not the... the mountains.

1587
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:53,070
Oh my gosh.

1588
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:55,550
I can't believe we have a new entrance and people just use it.

1589
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:57,890
Hello.

1590
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:00,390
Oh, that... I just watched that guy walk behind there.

1591
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:01,190
What the hell?

1592
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,390
I just watched him walk into the back.

1593
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,110
These people have no nerve.

1594
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,450
Like, no shame.

1595
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,010
Nothing.

1596
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,030
They're just like...

1597
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:13,030
Just like, yeah, I'm gonna... No... What's the word?

1598
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:15,250
You know when...

1599
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:16,630
Oh.

1600
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:18,530
Is that a Tengu?

1601
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:19,890
It absolutely is.

1602
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:21,130
That's a normal thing.

1603
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:21,610
Oh my gosh.

1604
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:22,090
Thank you.

1605
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:23,190
Penguin was a manager.

1606
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:24,910
You can see in the employee room.

1607
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:26,970
He was clearing out the expired product.

1608
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:29,150
You're right, Felix.

1609
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:29,710
You're right.

1610
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:30,770
Wait.

1611
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:32,130
Does that mean I would have gotten fired?

1612
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:32,970
How do I like...

1613
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:33,750
Oh gosh.

1614
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:34,530
We have a lot of people.

1615
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:34,910
Okay.

1616
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:35,650
Okay.

1617
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:36,330
Uh-oh.

1618
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:37,030
Uh-oh.

1619
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:38,330
We're getting... We're getting bonked.

1620
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:39,490
We're getting bonked.

1621
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:42,690
Excuse me.

1622
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:43,750
Excuse me.

1623
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:44,530
Excuse me.

1624
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:44,790
Oh.

1625
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:46,350
No sitting!

1626
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,110
I'm part-time worker!

1627
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:51,690
No being in the back rooms!

1628
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:52,270
Oh.

1629
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:54,770
I was so drunk, I couldn't move at all.

1630
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:55,690
No!

1631
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,150
No laying!

1632
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:59,110
I'm a part-time worker!

1633
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:03,390
Who else is around?

1634
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,130
Oh.

1635
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:08,370
Uh, wait.

1636
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:09,070
Oh!

1637
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:10,230
This person again!

1638
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:14,590
No having fun!

1639
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:17,230
I am part-time worker!

1640
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:19,270
Okay.

1641
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:20,590
All is well.

1642
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:24,110
Hello.

1643
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:24,330
Hello.

1644
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:25,890
Welcome... Oh!

1645
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:27,170
Welcome!

1646
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:28,270
Sorry.

1647
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:28,630
Sorry.

1648
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:29,770
Sorry it took so long.

1649
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:30,510
Sorry.

1650
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:30,770
Sorry.

1651
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:30,950
Sorry.

1652
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:32,870
Okay.

1653
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:34,790
Everybody loves this place!

1654
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,830
We have so many likes on Facebook!

1655
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:39,670
Ping-pong!

1656
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:43,010
I worked at a 7-Eleven before and I can confirm...

1657
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:44,970
It's pretty trash working there as a retail...

1658
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:45,670
Wait, like...

1659
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:47,730
Japanese 7-Eleven?

1660
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:50,010
Or somewhere else 7-Eleven.

1661
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,930
Ping-pong!

1662
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:56,110
Ping-pong!

1663
01:03:58,690 --> 01:03:59,790
Guy with a backpack.

1664
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:02,030
Oh!

1665
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:03,910
What is he gonna steal?

1666
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:06,630
We'll get him in a second.

1667
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:08,970
We have so many people to take care of.

1668
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:09,830
Oh, shoot.

1669
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,710
What is he gonna steal?

1670
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:12,890
Sand bridges?

1671
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:14,910
Sand bridges?

1672
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:16,690
Hello.

1673
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:20,450
Wow, that's a lot of junk food you got there.

1674
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:24,250
Okay.

1675
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:25,870
Thank you.

1676
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,620
Do you think he's coming back?

1677
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,080
I can hear someone walking back there.

1678
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:37,560
Oh!

1679
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:41,320
They really just use the new entrances.

1680
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,080
They don't even...

1681
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:42,420
Hahaha.

1682
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,420
You don't have to judge them, too.

1683
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:47,000
No!

1684
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:47,880
I'm not judging.

1685
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,440
I'm not judging.

1686
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,020
I'm not judging.

1687
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,280
One second!

1688
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,290
Canadian 7-Eleven.

1689
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:06,610
I am sadly Canadian.

1690
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:07,430
Hahaha.

1691
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:09,890
I'm sorry.

1692
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:12,270
I'll be in Canadia.

1693
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:15,170
I'll be in Canadia this weekend.

1694
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:18,310
Wait, we have two people?

1695
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:19,070
Oh!

1696
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:20,090
Oh!

1697
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:23,640
Let's go.

1698
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,380
You are not...

1699
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:24,760
Oh.

1700
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,300
What a convenient sensor.

1701
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,080
Ah!

1702
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:37,060
I think I saw this guy.

1703
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:37,700
What are you doing?

1704
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,300
He's just standing and giving a middle finger.

1705
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:40,780
Yes.

1706
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,440
You can't even...

1707
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,200
Oh my God.

1708
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,580
This is obscene.

1709
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,500
This is the worst one yet.

1710
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,460
I was just holding up my finger.

1711
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:53,160
Hahaha.

1712
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,040
Two of them.

1713
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,940
Oh my gosh, we have a long line.

1714
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:04,380
Looks like Raiden's back there.

1715
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:05,500
Hello!

1716
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,380
I'm so sorry!

1717
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:07,160
Thank you for waiting!

1718
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,960
Thank you so much for being patient!

1719
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,020
Hi!

1720
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:13,860
Dozo!

1721
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:14,880
Dozo!

1722
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:15,880
Dozo!

1723
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:16,540
Dozo!

1724
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,620
Retail workers with crowbars is too powerful.

1725
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,400
I feel really powerful.

1726
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,740
Wow, we have a long line.

1727
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,280
Oh gosh, you guys.

1728
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:25,880
I'm going to get fired.

1729
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,620
They're going to be like, you have not served enough people.

1730
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,220
Oh my gosh.

1731
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:32,640
Hi!

1732
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:34,440
Welcome!

1733
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,100
Oh, cookies.

1734
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:39,860
More cookies.

1735
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,800
Ice cream.

1736
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:42,580
Okay.

1737
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:43,960
She's having a good night.

1738
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,380
Okay, onigiri.

1739
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:49,320
Yuhai.

1740
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:49,780
Yuhi.

1741
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:50,480
Yuhai.

1742
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,000
Hi!

1743
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,280
Oh, I keep forgetting to bring the banana chips.

1744
01:06:59,140 --> 01:06:59,580
Hi!

1745
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,180
Hi!

1746
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:00,880
Hi!

1747
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:01,160
Hi!

1748
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:01,340
Hi!

1749
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:03,220
They just keep coming.

1750
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,020
They don't stop coming.

1751
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,520
So far, everything's very quiet.

1752
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:09,340
What's that guy doing over there?

1753
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,920
Also, another guy with a backpack.

1754
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:12,620
What is he going to steal?

1755
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,460
Thank you!

1756
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,320
Thank you!

1757
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,040
Thank you!

1758
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,380
What is he going to steal from us?

1759
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,540
Don't jinx it.

1760
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,240
I know.

1761
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,140
There's a guy that just walked back.

1762
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,600
He's going to do something silly.

1763
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:28,840
Hello!

1764
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:30,620
Hi!

1765
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,200
Hi!

1766
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:33,260
Hi!

1767
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,620
Okay, next!

1768
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,320
Uh-oh.

1769
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,200
Time to go be the silly police, everybody.

1770
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,980
That's more like what this game is.

1771
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:44,940
We're the silly police.

1772
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:49,580
We're the silly police.

1773
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:50,460
Where was he?

1774
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:51,660
Where'd he go?

1775
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:53,860
Wait, where'd the backpack man go?

1776
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,200
I saw him.

1777
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,080
Huh?

1778
01:07:58,660 --> 01:07:59,800
Is that him over there?

1779
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,600
So glad we have a...

1780
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:03,760
Oh, no?

1781
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:04,260
Huh?

1782
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:05,420
Huh?

1783
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:06,980
Lady eating?

1784
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:08,180
Oh.

1785
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,500
I am Captain Walker!

1786
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,060
Now we have another one.

1787
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:18,740
You!

1788
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:20,620
You!

1789
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,980
I don't know where you're off to!

1790
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:26,780
You haven't technically done anything wrong yet, but...

1791
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:27,080
Oh!

1792
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,320
Oh, my God.

1793
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:29,080
Two of them.

1794
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,840
He's putting broccoli on...

1795
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,460
I must plant broccoli.

1796
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,140
There's dirt on the other side!

1797
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:37,220
I am Captain Walker!

1798
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,080
Boo!

1799
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:41,840
I am Captain Walker!

1800
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,430
Another silly?

1801
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:47,750
Is it you?

1802
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,850
Oh, yep.

1803
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,610
I am Perch!

1804
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:51,290
I am Wacker!

1805
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:56,350
Why would you put broccoli on the seats, though?

1806
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:57,630
Hello.

1807
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:58,790
Please, one moment.

1808
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,030
I have two silly people around.

1809
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:01,290
Oh.

1810
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:03,190
You're eating hair products!

1811
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:08,950
Are you outside or are you in my...

1812
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:09,610
Oh, no.

1813
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:09,970
You're outside.

1814
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:11,390
One second.

1815
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:13,710
I'll come get you in just a second.

1816
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:16,990
I'll help you in one moment.

1817
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:18,670
Come on.

1818
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:22,230
Go!

1819
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:23,210
Go!

1820
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:23,730
Go!

1821
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:26,250
Bye, bye!

1822
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:27,350
Wonderful.

1823
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,470
Wow, they're leaving, like, little love notes for me!

1824
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:33,930
That makes me feel so bad.

1825
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:34,450
Okay.

1826
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:35,890
Hai, I'm so sorry.

1827
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:40,410
Oh.

1828
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:40,910
What?

1829
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:41,630
We have more silly?

1830
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,390
Oh, eww.

1831
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:47,650
In front of my face?

1832
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,410
I'm just having no shame!

1833
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:53,170
Let's see, where's our other guy?

1834
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:55,950
Is it you?

1835
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:57,850
No, you're just slow.

1836
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:01,230
Oh!

1837
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,530
This guy is whacking the trees!

1838
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,350
I'm going to cut down and spray them with herbicide!

1839
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:09,990
Why do you hate the environment?

1840
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:16,260
Minecraft?

1841
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:18,620
Grandma!

1842
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,620
Grandma, what are you...

1843
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,400
What are you hitting, for real?

1844
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:25,040
Grandma!

1845
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:26,260
Grandma!

1846
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,660
What are you...

1847
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,580
Grandma!

1848
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,460
Grandma, this is obscene!

1849
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:30,840
Grandma!

1850
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,160
Sorry,

1851
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,180
my depth perception.

1852
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,980
My depth perception.

1853
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:46,620
Okay!

1854
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,140
Wait, there's one more?

1855
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,570
Oh my god.

1856
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:00,010
No!

1857
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:01,730
I'm sorry, lady.

1858
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:02,950
You have six things!

1859
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:06,990
No!

1860
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:08,450
No!

1861
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:09,070
Not the microwave!

1862
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:10,850
I am part-time worker!

1863
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:14,310
Oh my god.

1864
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,030
I just saw that guy up here.

1865
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:18,110
What the...

1866
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:19,070
Part-time worker!

1867
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:20,890
Get

1868
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:25,390
out of here!

1869
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:26,770
I am part-time worker!

1870
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:29,830
Oh my god.

1871
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:30,730
What are you doing?

1872
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:32,650
I am part-time worker!

1873
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:34,430
Where are these guys coming from?

1874
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:38,860
Oh.

1875
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,620
He's bench pressing...

1876
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,120
Oh my god.

1877
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,320
Bandles everywhere!

1878
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:46,960
Not even...

1879
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:47,620
I can't even...

1880
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:49,020
I can't even poop in peace!

1881
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:53,340
Guy in a Speedo goggle and swimming cap?

1882
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:54,500
While you were shopping?

1883
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,080
Swimming on the ground aisles.

1884
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:57,380
Wait.

1885
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:57,700
No way.

1886
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:58,980
Are you serious?

1887
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:00,260
Are you kidding about that?

1888
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:03,780
Oh my gosh.

1889
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,020
They don't stop.

1890
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:05,520
Come on.

1891
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:05,940
Wait.

1892
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:06,820
I think I just saw...

1893
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,400
No?

1894
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:08,840
No.

1895
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,700
I'm getting bonked.

1896
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,460
But I don't see where they are at all.

1897
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:15,780
Oh.

1898
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:16,780
Hmm.

1899
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:17,420
What?

1900
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,020
I am part-time worker!

1901
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:19,600
No!

1902
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:20,420
Oh.

1903
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,040
Oh.

1904
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:22,660
Uh.

1905
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:24,900
Did I get hurt too?

1906
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:25,820
Or on accident?

1907
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:26,680
Wait.

1908
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:29,700
What are you doing?

1909
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:30,280
Stop eating!

1910
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,060
I am part-time worker!

1911
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:34,120
Oh my god.

1912
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,040
It's really revving up.

1913
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,240
Get off your phone!

1914
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,420
I am part-time worker!

1915
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:38,640
Double kill!

1916
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:38,820
I am part-time worker!

1917
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,140
No Karens!

1918
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,520
Oh my gosh.

1919
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,660
They are flipping me off again.

1920
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,120
I don't even want to see the second one.

1921
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,900
There is just one left.

1922
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,060
Oh wait.

1923
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,180
I think he is in here.

1924
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,580
I wonder if they have any underwear.

1925
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:00,620
What?

1926
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:02,540
Perfect!

1927
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:05,800
They want my underwear.

1928
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,200
Girl.

1929
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,520
This lady has been waiting forever.

1930
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:08,800
What?

1931
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:09,840
She is like, I have two things.

1932
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:10,220
Please.

1933
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:12,260
Please help me.

1934
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,320
We have three!

1935
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,220
Three silly people.

1936
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:22,780
I wouldn't put my underwear in there.

1937
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,420
Oh my gosh.

1938
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,300
Four silly people!

1939
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,420
Nice ass!

1940
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,420
I am part-time worker!

1941
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,200
Uh.

1942
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,480
Oh.

1943
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:36,600
Everybody is just lingering around.

1944
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:37,940
Oh.

1945
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:38,800
Oh.

1946
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:47,760
I am part-time worker!

1947
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:48,500
installment!

1948
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,840
I am part-time worker!

1949
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:51,300
Oh!

1950
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:52,800
Don't throw your crotch in me.

1951
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,500
In me face!

1952
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,140
Where was the other one?

1953
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,600
I have one left.

1954
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:00,640
Oh.

1955
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,100
There he is.

1956
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:04,060
Wait.

1957
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:04,480
Oh.

1958
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,640
I think he is in the backroom.

1959
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,420
I am part-time worker!

1960
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,240
Okay.

1961
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,320
Wait.

1962
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:14,100
Still not...

1963
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:14,360
There's only one guy?

1964
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:15,820
Oh, you!

1965
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:23,200
Okay, he was sleepy.

1966
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,680
Now he's fine.

1967
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,360
I actually helped him sleep, you know?

1968
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,400
I helped him sleep.

1969
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,640
He'll be sleeping real good now, you know?

1970
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:34,040
Hey!

1971
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,000
I just saw that!

1972
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,900
I just saw that guy walking to the back.

1973
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:38,800
You bitch!

1974
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,000
You bitch!

1975
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:40,420
Come here!

1976
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:42,300
Come here!

1977
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:48,540
Another one?

1978
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,440
Where are you at?

1979
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:53,620
Oh.

1980
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,000
No grilling on the premises!

1981
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,840
Peace... and quiet.

1982
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,300
Oh my god.

1983
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,720
There's no customers?

1984
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,600
What is that guy doing?

1985
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,660
I was gonna say there's no customers, there's no...

1986
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,560
What are you doing?

1987
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:18,260
Oh, okay.

1988
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,000
You're just leaving.

1989
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:19,720
I got you.

1990
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:26,190
Don't mind the blood in the aisles, everybody.

1991
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:28,370
I've killed everybody.

1992
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:32,010
Where are you going?

1993
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:43,710
You're only sorry because you got caught.

1994
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:55,710
Worthy.

1995
01:15:57,730 --> 01:15:59,030
That's my dinner, too!

1996
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,030
No eating my dinner.

1997
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,830
Hello, hello, hello.

1998
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:07,470
Sorry for the wait.

1999
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:10,750
Wow, that's a sweet, huh?

2000
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:13,970
Have a fun night.

2001
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,690
Is it that lady?

2002
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:19,430
Is she the problem?

2003
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:20,350
Oh, peace!

2004
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:22,250
Peace!

2005
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:29,130
One more.

2006
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:29,410
Oh!

2007
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:30,910
Oh my god!

2008
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,190
Everybody here is insane!

2009
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:44,360
Work on your technique!

2010
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:55,260
Is it you?

2011
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:57,680
Delicious!

2012
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,700
It's hair medicine!

2013
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:05,610
Oh my gosh.

2014
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:10,110
We had a moment to rest, and that was it.

2015
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:12,730
Oh my god.

2016
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:14,490
Oh, wrong thing.

2017
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:15,130
Here we go.

2018
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:21,470
What are you doing?

2019
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:22,450
What are you about to do?

2020
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:26,910
I caught you!

2021
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:28,490
Red-handed.

2022
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:30,050
What are you doing?

2023
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:31,310
Can I get this guy?

2024
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:36,370
I've tasted blood and I want more.

2025
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:39,330
Where are they?

2026
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:40,130
Where's the other...

2027
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:51,530
Oh.

2028
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:52,470
Wait, there's one more?

2029
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:54,810
Oh my god!

2030
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:57,150
Nothing like skipping out on the toilet.

2031
01:17:57,350 --> 01:18:00,490
What does that... What does that mean?

2032
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:08,820
Hello, sir.

2033
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:09,980
Thank you for being so patient.

2034
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:10,560
Thank you.

2035
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,780
Thank you very much.

2036
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,580
Oh my gosh.

2037
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,360
We have a long line now, guys.

2038
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,120
Okay.

2039
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:29,400
Maybe please learn to put your belongings down more gently.

2040
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,340
So they don't fall, you know.

2041
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:33,480
Hi!

2042
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:34,920
Okay.

2043
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,020
Nice.

2044
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:36,520
Onigiri.

2045
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,040
To my left?

2046
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:40,560
Nothing to my left.

2047
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:40,980
We're good.

2048
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,720
We have no troublemakers right now.

2049
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,300
The guy who was sleeping on the shelves?

2050
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,560
Well, he's changed his way.

2051
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,320
You know.

2052
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,460
He's changed his ways.

2053
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,180
He's mended his issues, you know.

2054
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,640
Shift is almost over.

2055
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:05,260
I know, right?

2056
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:06,940
Crazy.

2057
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,000
I'm learning the real retail experience.

2058
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,080
I've worked retail.

2059
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,260
Okay.

2060
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,100
You tried.

2061
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:20,060
You're currently dancing and spraying hairspray.

2062
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,060
Absolutely.

2063
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:21,860
Whoa!

2064
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,420
How did you carry all that?

2065
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:28,100
This guy is a... fun guy.

2066
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:29,580
Oh.

2067
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:30,020
Okay.

2068
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:34,660
Welcome!

2069
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:38,820
Okay.

2070
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:39,740
Wow.

2071
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,540
Peach-flavored potato chips.

2072
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,360
I'd try it.

2073
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:49,960
Okay.

2074
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,200
Yes, sir?

2075
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,940
The way he, like, slid up was so funny.

2076
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,220
Do you like the beach?

2077
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,120
I just watched that guy trip outside.

2078
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,500
One moment, sir.

2079
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,020
I must take care of some riff-raff.

2080
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:11,360
No sitting!

2081
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,140
I am part-time worker!

2082
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:14,800
Where?

2083
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:18,940
You?

2084
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,580
I'm part-time worker!

01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:24,200
You?

01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,420
I'm part-time worker!

2087
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,260

Where's the other one, though?

Oh.

2094
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:40,900
Aw, I hate punishing this guy.

2095
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,140
You're so awesome!

2096
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,080
I support what you do!

01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,660
I'm part-time worker!

2098
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:50,300
What the?

2099
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,940
You dropped your sensor.

2100
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,220
Grandma!

2101
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:54,640
Grandma!

2102
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:58,230

I'm part-time worker!

2104
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:05,070
They dropped their sensor!

2105
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:05,810
What's there?

2106
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:06,470
Oh.

I'm part-time worker!

2110
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:18,570
Grandma's a rebel.

2111
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:21,270
Feels just like home.

2112
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:24,990
You'll...

2113
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:26,470
I am...

2114
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,020
Suit your shade!

2115

I'm part-time worker!

2117
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:33,520
Let's do it again!

2118
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:34,940
More?

2119
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,060
Oh.

2120
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:36,800
Where?

2121
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:37,480
Oh, you?

2122
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,260
I am part-time worker!

2123
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,940
Why does getting rid of that guy spark joy?

2124
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:47,500
I'm part-time worker!

2125
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:48,700
I'm part-time worker!

2126
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:50,740
No!

2127
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,280
Wait, what's that sound?

2128
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:57,760
What's that sound?

2129
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:58,180
What's that sound?

2130
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:58,880
What's that sound?

2131
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,180
What's that sound?

2132
01:21:59,240 --> 01:21:59,580
What's that sound?

2133
01:21:59,680 --> 01:21:59,960
Stop!

2134
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:02,400
Why are you all so obs...

01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:16,110
What were you looking at?

2141
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:18,330
Oh, gosh!

I am part-time worker!

2146
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:32,170
Um.

2147
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:32,950
Oh, you?

2148
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:35,530

Tick-tick.

2155
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,920
I am part-time worker!

2156
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:53,640
There's so many people over here.

2157

Yeah.

2169
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:25,480
It's true that you have to deal with troublesome customers.

2170
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,980
But if you don't like it, that's fine.

2171
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,440
You can just beat them up.

2172
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:30,740
Take care of yourself.

2173
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,800
By the way, I'm going on vaca...

Could you take care of the store for a month or so?

2176
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,200
Is that in real time?

2177

I'm counting on you, part-timer!

2178

Okay.

I'm definitely quitting this job.

Ha...

2189
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:35,050

01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:35,730
Oh...

2191
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:37,630
I said that guy, his lip color didn't...

01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:38,750
Good shopper.

01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,970
Ordinary people hanging around a convenience store.

2196
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:45,470
A mystery.

2197
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:47,110

2198
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:49,830

2202
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:59,030

01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:14,390
Do you want to heat it up?

Destroy!

2216
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:16,330
A pawn from another store.

2217
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:17,830
I wanted to know if it was extra.

01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:45,770
The end!

2270
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:50,190
So there were a few that we didn't... that we actually didn't get!

2271
01:26:51,090 --> 01:26:51,770
Huh...

2272
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:53,930
Hmm...

2273
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:56,930
Piano man was good...

2274
01:26:57,930 --> 01:26:58,750
I don't...

2275
01:26:58,750 --> 01:26:59,690
We ended up...

2276
01:26:59,690 --> 01:26:59,930
I don't...

2277
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:00,410
Oh wait...

2278
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:02,510
Well, we did kind of get rid of him.

2279
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:03,050
Hahaha!

2280
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,400
There were a few that we didn't get!

2281
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,620
Should we try again?

2282
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:17,400
Yeah, I was thinking maybe like the 15 minute round to see...

2283
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:18,580
Oh, let's see...

2284
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:18,880
Hold on...

2285
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:19,600
Picture book...

2286
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:21,540
Revolution...

2287
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,580
Living in a corner...

2288
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,700
These names are so funny!

2289
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:26,780
Hahaha!

2290
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:30,740
These names are so funny!

2291
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:32,700
Hold on though...

2292
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:33,840
This one!

2293
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:36,140
Bad!

2294
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:37,860
Bad!

2295
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:46,980
One second...

2296
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:53,160
Hahaha!

2297
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:55,580
Hahaha!

2298
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:05,020
Oh, I'm a little...

2299
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:06,000
I'm a little off...

2300
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:06,380
But...

2301
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:06,960
Hahaha!

2302
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,160
Female ghost!

2303
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:10,560
Hahaha!

2304
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:12,940
It's me!

2305
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:14,040
Hahaha!

2306
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:16,540
Hahaha!

2307
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,240
It's like the pop-out type...

2308
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,220
Oh, yeah, I guess I should fix that too, right?

2309
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:21,740
One second...

2310
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:22,880
You're all even...

2311
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,940
Try to align it as perfectly as possible...

2312
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:28,360
As...

2313
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:28,460
As...

2314
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:30,420
Oh...

2315
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:33,920
Possible...

2316
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:35,180
Hey!

2317
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:49,840
Hahaha!

2318
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,220
Ready for something kinda cool?

2319
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:53,980
Boo!

2320
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:57,220
Now it's the pop-out type, for real!

2321
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,100
I'm tiny ghost!

2322
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:00,040
Brr!

2323
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:00,860
Brr!

2324
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:01,320
Ghost!

2325
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:01,900
Hahaha!

2326
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:09,150
Haunted check key...

2327
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:10,510
Oh my gosh, this is like a check key!

2328
01:29:10,570 --> 01:29:10,590
Oh!

2329
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:10,590
Hey!

2330
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:11,550
For real!

2331
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:12,310
Wow!

2332
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:13,370
Oh my gosh!

2333
01:29:15,610 --> 01:29:17,590
Okay, how do I go back to normal?

2334
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:22,190
There we go.

2335
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:26,070
There we go.

2336
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:27,430
There we go.

2337
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:31,350
Ghost checky!

2338
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:33,430
I love damn flag.

2339
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:34,670
That might be my favorite one.

2340
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:36,810
Damn flag!

2341
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:39,030
See, this one's a mystery one.

2342
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:41,770
Um...

2343
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:45,070
I also like this one too.

2344
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:47,150
The middle finger one.

2345
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:49,450
Um...

2346
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:51,670
Two...

2347
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:53,250
Three...

2348
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:55,550
Oh, it does say R18.

2349
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:01,030
Three...

2350
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:04,010
I think it's just three or four maybe.

2351
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:10,480
Oh my gosh, we only missed three!

2352
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:13,560
Do you think we could get them maybe in the 15 minutes?

2353
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:17,100
Maybe we should try.

2354
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:17,740
What's my score?

2355
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:19,720
Yay!

2356
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,820
What site asking for a friend?

2357
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:25,920
DL site.

2358
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:27,140
Let's try it!

2359
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:31,080
Let's try the 15 minutes and see if we can get the three.

2360
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:31,920
If not...

2361
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:33,300
Maybe someday.

2362
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:34,500
Okay.

2363
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:38,400
Work until the end of the day.

2364
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:41,880
I'm back here.

2365
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,360
Gosh.

2366
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,980
Feels strange being back here.

2367
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:47,240
Oh.

2368
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:48,780
Wow.

2369
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:50,320
We have all our...

2370
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,640
Everything is back to...

2371
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:53,140
There's no skylight.

2372
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:55,700
Everything's normal.

2373
01:30:56,620 --> 01:30:57,260
Wow.

2374
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,020
I'm just a normal...

2375
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,760
Normal worker, you know?

2376
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:02,660
Oh, the teeny weeny.

2377
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:05,140
Little guy.

2378
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,280
That's my little guy.

2379
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,540
I never made fun of that little guy.

2380
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:11,860
Feels too normal.

2381
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:12,300
He's normal now.

2382
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:13,360
Yeah.

2383
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:15,040
Actually, I am gonna make fun of you.

2384
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,080
You have no shoes on.

2385
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:18,880
What's wrong with you?

2386
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:21,320
What's that guy doing over there, huh?

2387
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,880
I'm nervous about him.

2388
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,720
Why is he over there?

2389
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:27,660
Short game.

2390
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:28,360
Oh, boy.

2391
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:31,980
It's already started.

2392
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:33,120
Oh, wait.

2393
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:34,100
Oh, my God.

2394
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:35,760
Goodbye!

2395
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,560
Oh, my God.

2396
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:40,620
They haven't even given us a second to...

2397
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:40,980
Oh, my God.

2398
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:41,840
Grandma's already gone.

2399
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:42,960
She's already getting ready for her casket.

2400
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,920
Grandma, you have so much to live for still!

2401
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:47,740
Oh.

2402
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:48,580
What do you want?

2403
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:49,640
What are you about to do?

2404
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,560
Worn out?

2405
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,060
Not on my watch!

2406
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:53,520
Go to sleep!

2407
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,100
We have a guy eating dirt and a guy taking out the tree.

2408
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,020
I'm part-time worker!

2409
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:03,060
Let her die.

2410
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:09,060
Well, we already lost the window.

2411
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:10,800
Okay.

2412
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:11,780
Hello.

2413
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,760
Sorry for taking so long.

2414
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:15,880
You're bald.

2415
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,480
You're like really bald.

2416
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,060
You just...

2417
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,300
This guy looks unnatural.

2418
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,320
What are you doing?

2419
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:22,860
Don't do it!

2420
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:23,300
Don't do it!

2421
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:23,860
Don't do it!

2422
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:24,880
Worn out.

2423
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,360
Part-time worker!

2424
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,320
What are you doing?

2425
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:32,920
What are you about to do?

2426
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:33,640
Hello.

2427
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:35,040
Welcome.

2428
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:38,180
So close.

2429
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:39,500
We almost saved it.

2430
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:39,740
What?

2431
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,420
You're too close to me.

2432
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,580
I am part-time worker!

2433
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:44,200
Oh.

2434
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:44,600
My bad.

2435
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,560
He was actually a good guy.

2436
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:47,900
Welcome.

2437
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:51,680
He was making me nervous, you guys.

2438
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,880
It was his man bun, you know?

2439
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:55,760
He's making me nervous.

2440
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:56,220
I don't know.

2441
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,100
I don't know.

2442
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:58,100
Welcome.

2443
01:32:59,100 --> 01:32:59,540
Peace.

2444
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:02,160
Victory.

2445
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:04,860
Is it her?

2446
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:05,520
Yeah.

2447
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,680
She's eating my chips.

2448
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:07,900
Oh my gosh.

2449
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:08,200
Okay.

2450
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,140
I'll take care of your stuff in just one moment.

2451
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:13,220
I am part-time worker!

2452
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:14,660
Personal space.

2453
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:15,500
That's what I'm saying.

2454
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,180
Oh, it's just a little pile of rubble.

2455
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:20,600
My poor microwave.

2456
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:30,500
Let's hope for some new crazy antics.

2457
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:32,380
Okay.

2458
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:34,480
We got our cooking man over here.

2459
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:35,060
Oh, wow.

2460
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:35,680
Already three?

2461
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:36,220
Okay.

2462
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:38,140
Fried rice!

2463
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,120
Part-time worker!

2464
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:41,380
Um.

2465
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:42,360
Uh.

2466
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:42,680
I don't know.

2467
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:43,400
Nobody's here.

2468
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:43,920
Where's the other ones?

2469
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:45,700
Oh.

2470
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,300
Just people laying down.

2471
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:49,300
People chillin'.

2472
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:51,160
Is that a crime?

2473
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:52,920
Is it a crime to be chill?

2474
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:58,560
No more microwave lunches.

2475
01:33:58,740 --> 01:33:59,280
I am part-time worker!

2476
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:01,360
Grandma, you're not allowed back here.

2477
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:08,170
Yes, but no.

2478
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:13,210
He's just chill like that, you guys.

2479
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:14,510
He's just chill like that.

2480
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:15,470
I'm hungry.

2481
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:15,850
Thank you!

2482
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:18,990
Thank you.

2483
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:19,470
Yes.

2484
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:20,370
Welcome.

2485
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:27,510
I like croquettes, but they're usually... I like the potato ones, you know?

2486
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,290
Oh, there's a lot of people.

2487
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:29,850
Okay.

2488
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:33,690
Where are they?

2489
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:34,830
Oh, they're just... Oh!

2490
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:36,670
Another... another bench.

2491
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:38,010
Oh no, this is the manga reader.

2492
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:42,610
How can you even read with that mask on?

2493
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:49,990
Oh, wait.

2494
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:51,010
I saw them.

2495
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:52,290
I saw them sitting...

2496
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:53,650
Maybe they were sitting inside.

2497
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:54,070
Oh gosh.

2498
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:58,090
Not having the back... the wall destroyed is so inconvenient, actually.

2499
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:01,410
Oh, you're right here.

2500
01:35:03,310 --> 01:35:04,710
No growing mushrooms!

2501
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:06,790
Oh.

2502
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:07,710
Oh, he's angry.

2503
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:13,590
Please leave.

2504
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:15,750
Ping -pong!

2505
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:17,210
Oh, this guy needs to sleep.

2506
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:19,010
You want some sticks?

2507
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:22,770
Yeah, get them sticks and chalky.

2508
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:23,890
You want that chalky?

2509
01:35:26,070 --> 01:35:26,870
Ping-pong!

2510
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:29,090
Die!

2511
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:33,970
It's an old manga trope.

2512
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:34,490
What?

2513
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:35,890
Growing mushrooms in the corner?

2514
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:39,490
Is it really?

2515
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:40,450
It's not that old, right?

2516
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:41,990
It's not that old of a trope.

2517
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:45,390
Oh my god!

2518
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:46,790
No flash photography!

2519
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:48,110
Paparazzi!

2520
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:50,830
Paparazzi!

2521
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:51,230
Paparazzi!

2522
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:54,110
Oh, you were so short, I barely even noticed you there.

2523
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:55,850
Why do you need it?

2524
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:57,110
Why do you need hairspray for?

2525
01:36:00,330 --> 01:36:01,030
Ping-pong!

2526
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:07,020
You're his Oshii?

2527
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:12,540
I'm so fast and efficient, aren't I?

2528
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:14,580
Uh-oh.

2529
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:15,320
There comes the robot.

2530
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:18,460
The robot's coming on in.

2531
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:19,640
Cold brew.

2532
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:21,960
There you go.

2533
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:26,010
What the?

2534
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:27,510
Where?

2535
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:36,550
Why is everybody so obsessed with me?

2536
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:41,530
I'm part-time wacker.

2537
01:36:44,310 --> 01:36:46,330
That guy looks like he's up to no good.

2538
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:47,090
Oh, I knew it!

2539
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:47,470
I knew it!

2540
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:47,930
I knew it!

2541
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:51,790
I knew you were up to no good!

2542
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:55,770
He was like stalking around like a creep.

2543
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:56,990
Oh, hello.

2544
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:01,070
If it's so hard, why don't you just stop working?

2545
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:02,930
Oh my god.

2546
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:12,980
Get out of here!

2547
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,720
Something's going on around here.

2548
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,220
The robot does say right things though.

2549
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:20,260
It's true.

2550
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,820
Isn't that his name?

2551
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,120
The robot that says right things?

2552
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:25,880
Welcome!

2553
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:27,540
Welcome.

2554
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:29,240
Oh my gosh.

2555
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:29,960
I just remembered.

2556
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:31,640
I'm going to be in Japan soon.

2557
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:33,200
I'll be able to get...

2558
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,500
Hey, why are you looking sussy, huh?

2559
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:36,840
I am part-time wacker!

2560
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:37,140
Oh, sorry.

2561
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:37,940
Sorry.

2562
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:45,020
He was like looking around like he was doing something.

2563
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:45,580
I don't know!

2564
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:46,680
Part-time wacker!

2565
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:51,560
I can get jelly and also I can get tomato ramen.

2566
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:52,340
Uh-oh.

2567
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:53,000
Wait.

2568
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:55,420
Actually, let's let that guy destroy the back wall.

2569
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:56,160
Not going to lie.

2570
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,060
Where's the other two people?

2571
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,540
Not on my watch.

2572
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,580
Let me speak to your manager.

2573
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:13,120
Quick march?

2574
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:15,160
What are you talking about?

2575
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:16,980
What are you doing?

2576
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:18,180
What is quick march?

2577
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,620
Oh, he's angry at me.

2578
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,280
Sorry.

2579
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:21,820
Sorry.

2580
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:24,800
Ketchup ramen.

2581
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:25,220
No!

2582
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,520
Different.

2583
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:29,900
I'm excited about it.

2584
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:31,980
What do you want?

2585
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:33,120
Oh my god!

2586
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,020
I'm part-time wacker!

2587
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:39,200
He just walked back here with such confidence.

2588
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:42,980
It's actually so good.

2589
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:45,960
There's like a chain that like has tomato ramen.

2590
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:47,840
What am I missing?

2591
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:48,500
Who am I missing?

2592
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,640
Oh, the guy that is about to break the wall!

2593
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:51,340
Right?

2594
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:52,180
Where did he go?

2595
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,220
Oh, three of them.

2596
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,120
Thank you!

2597
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:00,400
Oh, what are you doing?

2598
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:01,780
Let's play baseball.

2599
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:02,300
You?

2600
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:03,080
Target.

2601
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,360
I'm part-time wacker!

2602
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:08,480
All I was doing was playing baseball with you, man!

2603
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:09,840
Isn't that what you wanted, man?

2604
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:10,720
Oh my god.

2605
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:12,580
The pained look on his face.

2606
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:14,240
The crowbar!

2607
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:15,400
It's just another bat!

2608
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:16,680
It's just...

2609
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:17,200
Wow!

2610
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:18,920
Running man!

2611
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,480
I'm part-time wacker!

2612
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:32,060
Is this guy going to break the wall?

2613
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:32,900
Or what?

2614
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:34,360
He's going to put up his flag.

2615
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,860
I put up a fucking flag!

2616
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,700
I'm part-time wacker!

2617
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:42,340
What an idiot.

2618
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:46,080
What an idiot.

2619
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:52,300
Oh, piano man.

2620
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:56,100
Sing us a song, piano man.

2621
01:39:57,380 --> 01:39:58,780
He's taking his damn time.

2622
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:01,180
That's what he is.

2623
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:06,280
Do I have to get close to him?

2624
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:08,360
Thank you!

2625
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:12,420
Thanks for the back door!

2626
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,280
Oh my god, there's just debris everywhere.

2627
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:17,080
Hello.

2628
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:18,060
Excuse me.

2629
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:25,980
Oh sorry, I didn't notice it amongst all the debris.

2630
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:29,640
But it said this guy's a good guy!

2631
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:31,260
Stay positive.

2632
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:31,760
Oh!

2633
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:38,920
You think you can do yoga here?

2634
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:44,420
Stay positive.

2635
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,480
Uh oh.

2636
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,800
What do I do with the penguin, you guys?

2637
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,620
Oh, broccoli!

2638
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,100
No, I don't want to be healthy!

2639
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,160
I think I have to take Piano Man out.

2640
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:01,780
Wait, where are you going?

2641
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,120
What are you about to do?

2642
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:05,180
Oops.

2643
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:06,580
He was normal.

2644
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:14,730
Isn't this guy normal too?

2645
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:16,130
He just runs out, doesn't he?

2646
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:18,110
He just stands there and then he runs away.

2647
01:41:18,930 --> 01:41:20,450
I like the piano though.

2648
01:41:21,150 --> 01:41:22,670
Pre-emptive strike.

2649
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:25,170
Why was he walking towards the back?

2650
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:31,110
Oh, there he goes.

2651
01:41:32,610 --> 01:41:33,710
He ran somewhere.

2652
01:41:34,730 --> 01:41:35,450
Thank you!

2653
01:41:38,090 --> 01:41:38,630
Oh!

2654
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:44,100
I lose so much!

2655
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:45,420
Oh my goodness, I didn't even realize.

2656
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:50,000
Oops.

2657
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:51,340
Depth perception.

2658
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:57,500
It's okay, I'm not going for scoring, everybody.

2659
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:58,600
We're just...

2660
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,320
Oh my god.

2661
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:02,620
We're trying to get the new people.

2662
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:04,220
I am Hatchime Walker!

2663
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:08,240
Jojo was plus zero.

2664
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:12,980
I think because there's like good guys and then there's bad guys.

2665
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,740
Like good... there's good...

2666
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:16,560
What the...

2667
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:16,900
Oh!

2668
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:17,920
What the...

2669
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,100
What were you doing in there?

2670
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:20,540
What were you doing in there?

2671
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:21,460
Oh my god, wait.

2672
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,140
Why do you look so happy?

2673
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,200
I am Hatchime Walker!

2674
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,040
He looks so satisfied!

2675
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:40,530
What are you doing?

2676
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:42,670
Oh, you're just walking.

2677
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:43,890
Never mind.

2678
01:42:44,110 --> 01:42:44,330
No!

2679
01:42:44,330 --> 01:42:46,470
I am Hatchime Walker!

2680
01:42:47,330 --> 01:42:49,130
He was in there for a long time.

2681
01:42:51,050 --> 01:42:51,530
Oh.

2682
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:52,610
Depth perception!

2683
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:54,570
I am Hatchime Walker!

2684
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:56,350
Oh wow, so fast.

2685
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:57,850
Oh, the flag.

2686
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:00,450
I am Hatchime Walker!

2687
01:43:00,450 --> 01:43:00,810
Lost!

2688
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:02,070
Thanks for the wine, gifted.

2689
01:43:02,190 --> 01:43:02,690
Thank you.

2690
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:03,110
Oh.

2691
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:04,670
Let's play baseball.

2692
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:05,670
You, the ball.

2693
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:06,750
Oh, sorry.

2694
01:43:06,970 --> 01:43:08,590
Your head looked like a ball to me.

2695
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:09,830
Where are you going?

2696
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:19,960
Hmm, we still have two.

2697
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:22,860
Three.

2698
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,500
I am Hatchime Walker!

2699
01:43:26,740 --> 01:43:27,580
Go into the garbage!

2700
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:35,000
Oh my god.

2701
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:35,420
Five?

2702
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:36,500
Five?

2703
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:38,060
Anybody in here?

2704
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:38,520
No?

2705
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:40,100
Oh my god.

2706
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:42,040
This guy checking himself out.

2707
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,420
This guy doing...

2708
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:50,040
What are you doing?

2709
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:50,220
Oh.

2710
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:52,260
I am Hatchime Walker!

2711
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:53,020
Huh!

2712
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:53,980
Huh!

2713
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:54,560
Huh!

2714
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:54,940
Huh!

2715
01:43:54,940 --> 01:43:55,240
Huh!

2716
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:57,260
I am Hatchime Walker!

2717
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:58,000
Gah!

2718
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,880
I don't think we got any of the new ones.

2719
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:06,120
I am Hatchime Walker!

2720
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,440
I'm surprised your crowbar has no blood on it.

2721
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:09,400
Oh, aw man.

2722
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:11,200
Hmm.

2723
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,140
I don't think we got any new ones.

2724
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:18,660
Oh!

2725
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:19,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2726
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:20,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2727
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:25,820
You have to deal with troublesome customers, but if you don't like it, that's fine.

2728
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,260
You can just beat them up.

2729
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:28,800
I will beat them up.

2730
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,760
I will beat them up.

2731
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:32,140
Hmm.

2732
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:34,020
Jojo?

2733
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,780
What do you mean Jojo?

2734
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:39,360
I am Hatchime Walker!

2735
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,220
That one wasn't new.

2736
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,680
Unless me beating them up was new.

2737
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:50,120
Piano Man Wrecked!

2738
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:50,500
Piano Man Wrecked!

2739
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:50,640
Piano Man Wrecked!

2740
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:51,900
No, we have Piano Man...

2741
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,340
He was already listed, wasn't he?

2742
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:57,640
Is there a way to skip this?

2743
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:58,140
Oh.

2744
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:58,460
Oh.

2745
01:44:58,500 --> 01:44:58,760
Nope.

2746
01:44:59,420 --> 01:44:59,860
Oh.

2747
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:04,830
I can't skip the credits.

2748
01:45:08,110 --> 01:45:09,230
The R18 guy?

2749
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:10,290
No, we got him.

2750
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:15,970
You have to not bonk the good ones.

2751
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:16,570
Let's see.

2752
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:17,830
This one.

2753
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:21,930
Oh, press Y to close.

2754
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:22,950
OK.

2755
01:45:24,030 --> 01:45:24,470
OK.

2756
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:30,290
Penguin!

2757
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:35,400
There we go.

2758
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:45,320
Penguin cute.

2759
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,260
Still three.

2760
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:48,940
We still didn't get the new ones.

2761
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,080
No piano man listen.

2762
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,760
No, I could have sworn I saw him in here.

2763
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:00,140
Because I didn't take him out before, right?

2764
01:46:04,730 --> 01:46:05,130
Amplifier...

2765
01:46:07,870 --> 01:46:09,710
Sorry, it's hard to like, read chat.

2766
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:12,050
If you're like, telling me something, I'm not really reading chat.

2767
01:46:12,210 --> 01:46:16,190
Because it's kind of one of those games where you're just like, running all over the place, you know?

2768
01:46:18,690 --> 01:46:19,770
Oh, maybe... oh.

2769
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:26,870
Maybe I thought he was listed because I saw the people with the blue and red... this guy.

2770
01:46:26,930 --> 01:46:27,590
See this outfit.

2771
01:46:29,570 --> 01:46:30,550
Oh, you're right.

2772
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:31,850
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2773
01:46:33,610 --> 01:46:35,030
Ignoring us for a part-time job.

2774
01:46:37,790 --> 01:46:38,270
Yeah.

2775
01:46:38,790 --> 01:46:40,510
You bonked both times.

2776
01:46:40,690 --> 01:46:41,850
Oh, okay, okay.

2777
01:46:42,450 --> 01:46:43,250
Oh, okay.

2778
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:45,150
Well, I didn't realize that, like, to...

2779
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:50,410
To get them listed also, that you had to not bonk them, so...

2780
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:51,410
That's my bad.

2781
01:46:52,810 --> 01:46:53,930
That's my bad.

2782
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:55,370
What was the other ones though?

2783
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:57,570
This is such an epic picture.

2784
01:46:57,830 --> 01:46:59,090
Uncle Wallbreaker.

2785
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:03,430
Oh, and the JoJo might be good.

2786
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:04,090
Oh, yeah!

2787
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:05,750
Okay, okay, okay.

2788
01:47:05,930 --> 01:47:07,050
So both of them are fine.

2789
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:09,590
So that's two, but what's the last one?

2790
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:13,150
I feel like maybe, then, we've seen all of them, right?

2791
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:15,530
Hmm...

2792
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:20,890
Maybe we've seen all of them.

2793
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:24,350
If there's one more, maybe I accidentally bonked someone that I didn't mean to.

2794
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:28,510
The guy blocking you?

2795
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:35,110
I said the coolest thing ever in chat earlier, too.

2796
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:36,890
Too bad he didn't see.

2797
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:40,490
Are there any other endings?

2798
01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:41,870
I don't... I don't think so.

2799
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:44,670
I don't think there are, right?

2800
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:48,170
Seems to be a one ending thing.

2801
01:47:48,370 --> 01:47:49,810
Unless you have, like, zero points.

2802
01:47:49,970 --> 01:47:50,230
That'd be...

2803
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:50,470
What?

2804
01:47:50,510 --> 01:47:52,030
Can you get negative points, you think?

2805
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:55,590
There's a guy that bathes in the water tank next...

2806
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:55,870
Oh, no!

2807
01:47:55,950 --> 01:47:56,690
I had that one!

2808
01:47:57,470 --> 01:48:00,130
I did get that one, but he can't be a good guy, right?

2809
01:48:00,710 --> 01:48:01,810
I did get that guy.

2810
01:48:02,010 --> 01:48:03,130
He's in here for sure.

2811
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:07,410
I got that guy.

2812
01:48:07,610 --> 01:48:09,970
That guy... That guy... I had him earlier.

2813
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:11,010
What else is there?

2814
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:11,850
Hmm...

2815
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:18,800
Beat everyone.

2816
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:21,000
Beat up everyone, Minto.

2817
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:24,360
You can get negative points?

2818
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:25,120
No way!

2819
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:32,350
We did get him.

2820
01:48:32,410 --> 01:48:32,570
Yeah!

2821
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:33,550
Oh, there he is!

2822
01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:33,910
Soop!

2823
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:36,030
Soop!

2824
01:48:36,590 --> 01:48:37,630
Go, Soop!

2825
01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:46,090
I've never seen the art team guy stay there long enough to leave before.

2826
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:51,890
He looked so satisfied, too, as he was leaving.

2827
01:48:52,190 --> 01:48:53,310
He was just like...

2828
01:48:54,590 --> 01:48:55,910
That was good.

2829
01:48:57,410 --> 01:49:03,170
What a thrill going on... going on those kinds of sites at a convenience store.

2830
01:49:03,170 --> 01:49:04,450
Or a PC.

2831
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:05,250
That's crazy.

2832
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:07,930
The guy that throws the food over the counter?

2833
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:12,090
Oh, you think that...

2834
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:15,710
The guys that are rude customers, you think they count?

2835
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:17,410
Because we know the two.

2836
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:20,110
We have, what, three that we haven't been able to get?

2837
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:22,410
It's, uh...

2838
01:49:22,410 --> 01:49:24,130
It's three that we haven't been able to get.

2839
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:28,610
So, it's Piano Man, Jojo Pose, and...

2840
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:30,290
Um...

2841
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:33,210
Maybe the guys that throw the thing?

2842
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:37,250
Okay, let's do another 15 minutes and see what we can get.

2843
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:42,210
The guy who stands next to you uncomfortably.

2844
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:49,140
No, but I don't think I bonked that guy once before.

2845
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:49,860
Okay.

2846
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:51,280
Alright, last round!

2847
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:51,960
Last round!

2848
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:52,600
Last round!

2849
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:54,860
One more time!

2850
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:55,760
One more time!

2851
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:00,480
Alright, team guy read Ayami-sensei's work.

2852
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:01,880
I don't want to bonk him, then!

2853
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:04,460
He's a man of culture!

2854
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:16,120
He really is a manager.

2855
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:18,540
Why is it...

2856
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:20,140
Why is it Juushimatsu?

2857
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:21,720
Like Osomatsu-san.

2858
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:25,600
Hello!

2859
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:26,280
Welcome!

2860
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:28,260
Welcome!

2861
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:34,120
Got your gum... already?

2862
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:37,120
What is this guy doing?

2863
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:40,360
What are you doing?

2864
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:43,560
What are you doing?

2865
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:46,160
You're the bad guy, right?

2866
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:50,000
He's just like checking his shoes out.

2867
01:50:50,540 --> 01:50:50,740
Oh!

2868
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:54,440
Uh...

2869
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:56,500
Uh...

2870
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:57,440
Is he...

2871
01:50:59,180 --> 01:50:59,700
Ah!

2872
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:01,000
You are the bad one!

2873
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:03,260
Haha!

2874
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:06,380
Oh!

2875
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:08,080
This is new!

2876
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:09,980
Worn out.

2877
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:11,120
No, he's fine!

2878
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:12,760
This guy is fine!

2879
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:14,400
He's just taking...

2880
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:15,860
That's what the bench is for!

2881
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:16,980
Oh!

2882
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:17,640
Okay.

2883
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:18,860
Bye!

2884
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:19,480
Bye, grandpa!

2885
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:25,340
Oh my...

2886
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:26,520
There's nothing going on in here!

2887
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:28,120
Nothing's going on in here!

2888
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:32,400
I run a well-fed establishment!

2889
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:33,600
Hello, sir!

2890
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:33,980
Wow!

2891
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:36,280
I don't think I've seen that model.

2892
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:38,740
That character model?

2893
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:39,940
Okay, we're...

2894
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:40,120
Oh!

2895
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:40,900
Uh...

2896
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:41,440
Uh...

2897
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:41,520
Uh...

2898
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,740
We're getting a few new things.

2899
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:44,840
Excuse me.

2900
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:45,100
Sorry.

2901
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:47,080
I don't mean to be so close to you.

2902
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:47,860
You know?

2903
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:49,360
Ping-pong!

2904
01:51:50,540 --> 01:51:51,060
Okay.

2905
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:52,160
Thanks for that.

2906
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:55,620
Oh!

2907
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:56,160
Well-fed?

2908
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,060
I meant to say...

2909
01:51:57,740 --> 01:51:59,480
A well-oiled...

2910
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:01,360
You know?

2911
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,400
Like a well-oiled machine.

2912
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:07,080
Oopsie.

2913
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:08,560
Boop!

2914
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:10,020
Boop!

2915
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:12,500
That guy didn't take anything, right?

2916
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:14,740
That guy didn't take anything, right?

2917
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:15,780
Oh!

2918
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:16,280
Ah!

2919
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:17,340
You're rude!

2920
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:18,440
You're rude!

2921
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:18,940
You're rude!

2922
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:20,120
Quick merch!

2923
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:22,560
Oh.

2924
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:23,640
You guys?

2925
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:24,640
Uh...

2926
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:24,840
Ah!

2927
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:26,320
Look at me!

2928
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:26,700
Oh my god!

2929
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,100
He just filmed me killing a person!

2930
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:29,080
No witnesses!

2931
01:52:31,300 --> 01:52:31,820
Hello.

2932
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:46,060
Oh my god.

2933
01:52:47,860 --> 01:52:48,420
Grandpa.

2934
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:50,400
Grandpa, you have to...

2935
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:50,700
Oh.

2936
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:52,200
Actually you're a young guy.

2937
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:52,600
Sorry.

2938
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:53,600
I'm a young guy!

2939
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,360
You're a young guy!

2940
01:52:56,140 --> 01:52:57,560
Ghosts don't appear on cameras.

2941
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:58,000
They do!

2942
01:52:58,440 --> 01:52:59,460
What are you doing?

2943
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:01,280
Are you gonna go eat that dirt?

2944
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:05,140
Who's gonna whack my tree?

2945
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,160
I'm gonna whack you!

2946
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:11,400
Smoking guy...

2947
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:12,720
I'm gonna...

2948
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:14,720
Hey!

2949
01:53:16,260 --> 01:53:18,100
Oh, he's the flag guy!

2950
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:22,260
Grandpa looking ahead.

2951
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:23,940
Oh my god.

2952
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:25,380
Oh, no, that's not you.

2953
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:27,100
Huh?

2954
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:27,900
Huh?

2955
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:29,020
Oh.

2956
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:29,520
Oh.

2957
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:30,620
Ping-pong!

2958
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:54,660
Sometimes you pre-bonk everyone.

2959
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,740
Yeah, but sometimes I like to see what they do.

2960
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:02,240
If I... Also, I don't always recognize who's the bad guy.

2961
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:07,960
Sometimes I like to see what they do.

2962
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:08,500
Hello!

2963
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:13,280
Sleep forever.

2964
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:20,960
Is it him?

2965
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:22,680
Okay!

2966
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:26,100
Wow, he's really ganky.

2967
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:29,520
Okay.

2968
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:30,900
Donald!

2969
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:31,860
Thanks for two months!

2970
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:33,320
Thanks!

2971
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:35,300
One second.

2972
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:36,160
One moment.

2973
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:36,840
Yeah!

2974
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:39,300
Lady!

2975
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:47,420
Who am I missing?

2976
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:50,320
Hey, hey!

2977
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:51,260
That's property!

2978
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:52,840
That's good property!

2979
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:55,220
I'm Five Time Walker!

2980
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:55,560
Whoa!

2981
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:57,820
Lost thanks to the five!

2982
01:54:58,680 --> 01:54:59,200
Gifted!

2983
01:54:59,380 --> 01:55:00,600
I'm Five Time Walker!

2984
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:03,120
That guy is definitely dead.

2985
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:05,140
I like got right on his neck.

2986
01:55:07,780 --> 01:55:08,960
Sorry about the wait.

2987
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:09,520
Oh, yeah.

2988
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:15,260
Alright, we need Jojo person back and we need piano back.

2989
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:17,760
Ping-pong!

2990
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:23,720
The way they apologize is so funny.

2991
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:26,240
Parkour is very dangerous.

2992
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:27,280
Yeah, I could...

2993
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:33,020
If they get hurt on my property, they could get mad at me, you know?

2994
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:36,600
They could sue us.

2995
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:38,540
They could be like, I got hurt on your property.

2996
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:40,700
Even though it's my fault.

2997
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:42,400
I'm gonna sue you.

2998
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:44,680
They could say that.

2999
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:45,400
They could say that.

3000
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:47,720
Lemon Carubito, what's wrong with you?

3001
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,220
Everybody knows Melon is the best flavor.

3002
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:51,040
Ah!

3003
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:55,060
I can't hurt you or else I'm gonna get a bad name.

3004
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:55,380
I can't score.

3005
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:04,120
I hope you have a prolapsed anus, sir.

3006
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:05,480
Anyway, hello.

3007
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:09,100
Beep.

3008
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:10,620
Beep.

3009
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:12,260
Beep.

3010
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:14,280
Beep.

3011
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:15,660
Beep.

3012
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:18,280
The robot.

3013
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:20,960
Oh, that's the guy with the bat, isn't it?

3014
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:23,300
It's fine.

3015
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:24,080
He comes over to me.

3016
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:25,840
He comes up to me.

3017
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:26,500
Hey, man.

3018
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:29,360
Oh, there's a guy giving me the finger even!

3019
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:30,860
Hey, chill out.

3020
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,560
I'm trying to check out somebody, okay?

3021
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:34,660
Chill out!

3022
01:56:34,940 --> 01:56:36,080
I'm part-time worker!

3023
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:38,600
Proportional response.

3024
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:39,180
Of course!

3025
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:44,540
I am part-time worker!

3026
01:56:45,700 --> 01:56:47,420
I'm part-time worker!

3027
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:47,840
I am part-time worker!

3028
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:49,020
Oh,

3029
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:57,180
the guy that's gonna destroy the wall.

3030
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:00,960
I am part-time worker!

3031
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:02,920
Oh, flag!

3032
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:05,900
Do it.

3033
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:06,820
I dare you.

3034
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:09,560
I am part-time worker!

3035
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:13,960
Hello.

3036
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:15,080
Sorry for the wait.

3037
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:21,400
One, two, three, four, five.

3038
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:22,200
Five.

3039
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:26,060
It's just a guy smoking.

3040
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:30,020
One, two, three...

3041
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:30,640
Oh, sorry.

3042
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:33,440
One moment, please.

3043
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:37,200
You delinquent!

3044
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:38,480
You delinquent!

3045
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:40,080
I'm part-time worker!

3046
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:50,640
Money!

3047
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:53,380
Money!

3048
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:54,340
Money!

3049
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:55,540
Money!

3050
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:57,700
I am part-time worker!

3051
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:04,160
What do you want...

3052
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,440
He doesn't even say anything.

3053
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,200
What do you mean money?

3054
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:08,420
Like, count the money?

3055
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:10,600
Like, what do you want with the money?

3056
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:13,200
Count it?

3057
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:15,820
Um, you know...

3058
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:17,940
Spend it?

3059
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:20,360
Receive it?

3060
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:21,380
Oh!

3061
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:23,900
Oh, this is the guy that's...

3062
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:25,300
You know what?

3063
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:27,000
Why can't he work here?

3064
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:29,800
Wait, that car...

3065
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:31,200
Isn't that the one that drives into the wall?

3066
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:31,360
Or the window?

3067
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:32,180
Or am I crazy?

3068
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:35,380
I think it is.

3069
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:40,560
Let me see.

3070
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:41,240
Do you have eyebrows?

3071
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,040
No eyebrows!

3072
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:44,740
I'm part-time worker!

3073
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,140
Let's go take care of this car real quick.

3074
01:58:57,010 --> 01:58:58,530
Well, we have a new...

3075
01:58:58,530 --> 01:58:59,870
The ghost is back!

3076
01:59:01,410 --> 01:59:02,190
Hey, I'm Dragon.

3077
01:59:02,310 --> 01:59:03,030
Thanks for the 10 gift.

3078
01:59:05,490 --> 01:59:06,370
Thank you.

3079
01:59:13,890 --> 01:59:14,450
Welcome!

3080
01:59:14,990 --> 01:59:15,370
Welcome!

3081
01:59:19,230 --> 01:59:19,790
Nice.

3082
01:59:19,790 --> 01:59:20,730
Staying healthy.

3083
01:59:21,950 --> 01:59:22,510
Chonky.

3084
01:59:24,470 --> 01:59:25,350
The Piano!

3085
01:59:25,530 --> 01:59:26,210
And the JoJo!

3086
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:26,830
Okay.

3087
01:59:26,970 --> 01:59:28,150
I see the JoJo.

3088
01:59:28,770 --> 01:59:29,750
Hello, JoJo.

3089
01:59:29,810 --> 01:59:31,150
I'm not going to bonk you.

3090
01:59:31,450 --> 01:59:32,270
You're fine.

3091
01:59:32,450 --> 01:59:33,310
You're just standing there.

3092
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:34,670
Oh!

3093
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:35,350
Okay.

3094
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:37,030
Standing is not a crime.

3095
01:59:40,410 --> 01:59:41,850
Stay positive.

3096
01:59:53,130 --> 01:59:54,570
You're a panty thief!

3097
01:59:58,170 --> 01:59:59,770
Stay positive.

3098
02:00:00,750 --> 02:00:01,550
Hello.

3099
02:00:04,870 --> 02:00:07,570
Sing us a song, a piano man.

3100
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:10,610
Oh my god.

3101
02:00:10,710 --> 02:00:11,210
Oh my god.

3102
02:00:17,970 --> 02:00:19,330
I don't know where the other...

3103
02:00:20,470 --> 02:00:21,970
Our other weirdo is.

3104
02:00:25,630 --> 02:00:27,090
Where's the nuisance?

3105
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:30,270
It says we have one nuisance, but I... Oh, there he is.

3106
02:00:34,030 --> 02:00:35,070
Is the evil ghost?

3107
02:00:35,150 --> 02:00:36,690
No, she's not doing anything yet.

3108
02:00:37,090 --> 02:00:37,710
There we go.

3109
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:40,990
Now she's a nuisance.

3110
02:00:41,830 --> 02:00:42,890
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

3111
02:00:43,590 --> 02:00:43,950
Boo.

3112
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:50,200
What was under her dress?

3113
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:54,560
What was under her dress?

3114
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:55,080
What was under her dress?

3115
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:56,060
Yoga lady's fine, right?

3116
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:57,860
I have to train.

3117
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:00,660
Isn't yoga lady alright?

3118
02:01:03,380 --> 02:01:03,740
Isn't yoga lady alright?

3119
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:06,940
Hi aunties?

3120
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:12,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

3121
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:13,740
I see him going in there.

3122
02:01:13,820 --> 02:01:14,700
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3123
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:15,700
Oh.

3124
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:17,520
Oh, I thought he was gonna smoke.

3125
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:19,220
Ha, ha, ha.

3126
02:01:20,660 --> 02:01:24,120
It's only legs, no details, like Left 4 Dead 2 Zombies.

3127
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:25,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

3128
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:30,840
I'm a part-time worker!

3129
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:32,140
I'm a part-time worker!

3130
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,220
Oh, starting to ramp up a little bit.

3131
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:36,580
I'm a part-time worker!

3132
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:37,780
Okay, so now...

3133
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:41,400
I put up a fucking flag!

3134
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:42,720
I'm a part-time worker!

3135
02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:47,620
I'm a part-time worker!

3136
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:47,860
I'm a part-time worker!

3137
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:53,440
I'm a part-time worker!

3138
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:55,120
I'm a part-time worker!

3139
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:57,500
I don't understand!

3140
02:01:57,920 --> 02:01:59,500
Hey, come on out!

3141
02:02:02,070 --> 02:02:02,790
Shrink!

3142
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:06,230
He's literally a nanomach- Ah!

3143
02:02:06,930 --> 02:02:08,610
Where's the nanomachines guy?

3144
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:10,710
I killed a senator!

3145
02:02:11,150 --> 02:02:11,650
Goodbye!

3146
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:13,670
How will I stay?

3147
02:02:17,970 --> 02:02:19,050
Oh my god.

3148
02:02:20,490 --> 02:02:22,010
This guy just smokes!

3149
02:02:22,750 --> 02:02:23,750
Oh my god.

3150
02:02:25,390 --> 02:02:26,230
Oh my god.

3151
02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:27,390
This guy just smoked...

3152
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:31,700
Nanomachines son.

3153
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:34,180
You're not a superhero!

3154
02:02:36,740 --> 02:02:38,380
Your outfit is...

3155
02:02:38,380 --> 02:02:39,360
stupid!

3156
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:43,040
What superhero wears vans?

3157
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:49,290
Oh my god.

3158
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:52,190
Chill out!

3159
02:02:52,550 --> 02:02:57,020
Where'd you go?

3160
02:02:57,120 --> 02:02:57,580
Oh my god, wait.

3161
02:02:57,760 --> 02:02:58,620
Is it him?

3162
02:02:58,620 --> 02:02:59,240
No!

3163
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:03,780
We never see the R18 guy doing his business.

3164
02:03:04,180 --> 02:03:04,660
You know what?

3165
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:05,900
That's probably for the best, isn't it?

3166
02:03:08,060 --> 02:03:09,960
That's the third time we've had him.

3167
02:03:11,180 --> 02:03:13,640
The first time I didn't know what was going on.

3168
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:15,700
Because it was all yellow.

3169
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:23,880
A lot of troublesome customers.

3170
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:27,120
Do you want to?

3171
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:28,300
I don't know.

3172
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,620
I just want to see what he's looking at, you know?

3173
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:35,060
Everybody, let's go to karaoke after this instead.

3174
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:37,780
I propose...

3175
02:03:37,780 --> 02:03:41,500
we all instead go to the manga cafe and the karaoke.

3176
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:48,580
What if he's still in there?

3177
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:51,300
I mean...

3178
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:54,620
Yeah...

3179
02:03:57,700 --> 02:03:58,420
Yeah...

3180
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:01,100
Had an explosive time!

3181
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:02,620
Um...

3182
02:04:10,990 --> 02:04:11,510
Wait...

3183
02:04:12,030 --> 02:04:13,150
It's not letting me...

3184
02:04:13,970 --> 02:04:14,870
Press Y...

3185
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:15,350
Oh, there we go.

3186
02:04:15,490 --> 02:04:15,650
Okay.

3187
02:04:16,910 --> 02:04:19,130
Okay, let's see now if we got them.

3188
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:24,830
That hurt to say, didn't it?

3189
02:04:24,890 --> 02:04:25,070
No!

3190
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:29,150
Mint, please.

3191
02:04:32,210 --> 02:04:32,730
Okay.

3192
02:04:33,470 --> 02:04:34,150
Picture book.

3193
02:04:40,270 --> 02:04:40,790
Fool.

3194
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:42,750
Strong old man.

3195
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:43,450
It's so funny.

3196
02:04:44,470 --> 02:04:45,530
I'm stumped.

3197
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:49,470
The shirt on this guy.

3198
02:04:50,390 --> 02:04:51,890
Everything about it.

3199
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:53,410
It's so funny.

3200
02:04:53,470 --> 02:04:54,710
This game is so silly.

3201
02:04:55,770 --> 02:04:56,350
Oh!

3202
02:04:57,130 --> 02:04:58,070
Enigmatic pose!

3203
02:04:58,490 --> 02:04:59,670
Yeah, we got it!

3204
02:04:59,830 --> 02:05:00,550
Minus two.

3205
02:05:01,770 --> 02:05:02,630
Two what?

3206
02:05:03,550 --> 02:05:04,130
Or...

3207
02:05:04,130 --> 02:05:05,970
Wait, we had yoga before, didn't we?

3208
02:05:06,190 --> 02:05:06,750
Yankee.

3209
02:05:08,570 --> 02:05:09,150
Fireworks.

3210
02:05:11,110 --> 02:05:11,990
Stuff toy.

3211
02:05:13,070 --> 02:05:15,690
So now we'll see if we only have one or not.

3212
02:05:16,430 --> 02:05:17,030
Robbery.

3213
02:05:17,290 --> 02:05:18,270
Street piano!

3214
02:05:19,470 --> 02:05:21,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3215
02:05:22,490 --> 02:05:24,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3216
02:05:32,660 --> 02:05:33,260
Oh...

3217
02:05:33,260 --> 02:05:34,340
I think...

3218
02:05:34,980 --> 02:05:36,900
We might still have just one then.

3219
02:05:38,140 --> 02:05:38,740
Shoplifting.

3220
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:39,700
Baseball.

3221
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:41,400
Baseball 2.

3222
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:44,000
I don't...

3223
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,140
What does claymer mean?

3224
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:49,220
Hmm.

3225
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:53,720
Oh...

3226
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:53,980
Oh, wait.

3227
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:55,740
We're all close to the end.

3228
02:05:59,100 --> 02:05:59,820
Ahhh!

3229
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:00,820
People...

3230
02:06:00,820 --> 02:06:02,360
People running around screaming.

3231
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:03,340
We got him!

3232
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:03,700
Oh!

3233
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:07,880
He's claiming.

3234
02:06:08,300 --> 02:06:09,920
Yay, we did it!

3235
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:12,460
Yippee!

3236
02:06:14,860 --> 02:06:17,900
I don't know what the third one was at all, but...

3237
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:23,360
The last one was the person sitting on the bench?

3238
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:24,180
Oh, was it?

3239
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:25,260
Wait, did I miss him?

3240
02:06:30,310 --> 02:06:33,950
Maybe we just never got him before though, because...

3241
02:06:35,610 --> 02:06:39,610
We must not have gotten him, because there's no way I would have...

3242
02:06:39,610 --> 02:06:42,610
I don't remember bonking a guy sitting on a bench, you know?

3243
02:06:42,850 --> 02:06:44,530
But I also don't remember seeing...

3244
02:06:44,530 --> 02:06:45,030
Oh, him!

3245
02:06:45,230 --> 02:06:47,030
Ordinary person sitting on a chair!

3246
02:06:53,830 --> 02:06:54,310
Yay!

3247
02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:55,070
We did it!

3248
02:07:00,580 --> 02:07:01,660
We did it, everybody!

3249
02:07:01,900 --> 02:07:02,380
Good job!

3250
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:02,940
Good job!

3251
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:03,320
Good job!

3252
02:07:03,340 --> 02:07:04,060
What a fun game!

3253
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:10,320
What a fun... and creative game.

3254
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:14,660
The dev has a good sense of humor.

3255
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:16,960
That was so fun!

3256
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:20,860
I hope you guys enjoyed going to work with me.

3257
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:23,060
And all that fun stuff.

3258
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:25,060
Weird game.

3259
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,200
Fun baka game.

3260
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:27,940
Yeah!

3261
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:31,980
I didn't know so much about it before.

3262
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:36,400
So I... I now understand.

3263
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:37,940
I now understand.

3264
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:44,540
Hold on, I'm looking at some... these are some older...

3265
02:07:44,540 --> 02:07:46,580
Sorry for... I didn't hear the donos earlier.

3266
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:48,520
Get by...

3267
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:49,820
Also, Dress Hina gotcha fun.

3268
02:07:51,220 --> 02:07:53,260
Thank you so much for the Dress Hina!

3269
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:55,380
Wait, is she up?

3270
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:58,620
Not yet, right?

3271
02:07:58,840 --> 02:07:59,460
Not yet, right?

3272
02:08:00,020 --> 02:08:00,760
Soon, right?

3273
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:02,560
Soon, right?

3274
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:03,220
Soon, right?

3275
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:04,560
Not yet, right?

3276
02:08:08,910 --> 02:08:09,790
No, not yet.

3277
02:08:10,890 --> 02:08:11,510
Not yet.

3278
02:08:11,690 --> 02:08:12,010
Not yet.

3279
02:08:12,230 --> 02:08:13,190
50 more minutes.

3280
02:08:13,330 --> 02:08:13,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3281
02:08:14,010 --> 02:08:14,830
50 more minutes.

3282
02:08:17,690 --> 02:08:18,130
50 more minutes.

3283
02:08:18,130 --> 02:08:18,610
In an hour.

3284
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:24,810
Maybe I can talk for 50 minutes.

3285
02:08:26,250 --> 02:08:28,490
I can talk for 50 minutes, maybe.

3286
02:08:30,490 --> 02:08:33,190
Thank you for the Dress Hina gotcha fun.

3287
02:08:33,290 --> 02:08:34,830
Hopefully I don't have to use it on that.

3288
02:08:39,770 --> 02:08:41,070
Giant Princess, thank you!

3289
02:08:42,090 --> 02:08:43,150
K-Barn, thank you!

3290
02:08:43,150 --> 02:08:49,290
I wasn't there at the time, but the boss at my first job was taking the trash outside and came across a guy squatted on top of the commercial-sized garbage bin.

3291
02:08:49,550 --> 02:08:51,910
He looked at my boss and calmly said, Sorry, dude.

3292
02:08:51,990 --> 02:08:52,890
I got the runs?

3293
02:08:57,250 --> 02:08:57,950
Postcard signing?

3294
02:08:58,670 --> 02:09:00,850
Will you guys let me sign postcards for real?

3295
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:04,910
Will you guys let me sign postcards for real?

3296
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:07,390
Yeah?

3297
02:09:08,670 --> 02:09:11,110
While I wait for an hour?

3298
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:12,270
Okay.

3299
02:09:13,590 --> 02:09:15,050
I'm gonna quit the game then.

3300
02:09:15,170 --> 02:09:16,190
Hold on, give me one second.

3301
02:09:17,550 --> 02:09:19,470
Oh wait, give me one second again.

3302
02:09:20,790 --> 02:09:22,510
Give me one second again.

3303
02:09:27,950 --> 02:09:28,910
Oh wait,

3304
02:09:33,310 --> 02:09:33,970
I have no desk.

3305
02:09:34,550 --> 02:09:35,390
Where's my desk?

3306
02:09:39,250 --> 02:09:39,970
There it is.

3307
02:09:40,150 --> 02:09:41,350
Or table, rather.

3308
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:42,110
Not a desk.

3309
02:09:45,110 --> 02:09:46,390
Manual labor game.

3310
02:09:46,710 --> 02:09:47,830
Wait, menial?

3311
02:09:48,190 --> 02:09:49,350
Actual menial labor.

3312
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:50,410
Keynote stream.

3313
02:09:52,530 --> 02:09:53,330
Quit the game.

3314
02:09:53,550 --> 02:09:53,910
There we go.

3315
02:09:54,170 --> 02:09:56,630
Give me one second to pull up some music and then we can...

3316
02:09:57,210 --> 02:09:59,150
Then I can sign stuff while we wait.

3317
02:09:59,270 --> 02:10:01,530
Here, actually, I'm even gonna write a thing at the bottom.

3318
02:10:06,410 --> 02:10:08,630
Oh wait, let me do this.

3319
02:10:10,210 --> 02:10:11,630
Ta-da ta-da ta-da.

3320
02:10:12,190 --> 02:10:13,430
Ta-da ta-da ta-da.

3321
02:10:15,230 --> 02:10:15,650
Um...

3322
02:10:16,330 --> 02:10:22,070
Re- assigning postcards until dress Hina.

3323
02:10:22,450 --> 02:10:22,870
Gotcha.

3324
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:26,470
ta-da ta-da ta-da.

3325
02:10:26,590 --> 02:10:27,010
Oh.

3326
02:10:27,610 --> 02:10:28,770
ta-da ta-da ta-da.

3327
02:10:30,050 --> 02:10:30,910
ta-da ta- oh.

3328
02:10:31,010 --> 02:10:31,550
Music too.

3329
02:10:31,710 --> 02:10:32,330
My bad.

3330
02:10:32,670 --> 02:10:33,490
My bad, my bad.

3331
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:37,190
Since we went from jazz, let's keep on the jazz run.

3332
02:10:38,770 --> 02:10:39,190
Um...

3333
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:45,120
There we go.

3334
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:48,740
Sorry I'm late for work, boss.

3335
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:49,980
No worries.

3336
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:52,340
I'm just docking your pay.

3337
02:10:52,740 --> 02:10:53,440
A little bit.

3338
02:10:56,040 --> 02:10:58,520
Thanks for the exciting take your Wisp to work day, Mint.

3339
02:10:58,920 --> 02:10:59,360
Yeah!

3340
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:01,520
Did you guys ever do that as a kid?

3341
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:03,400
Well, like the take your...

3342
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:04,400
Oh wait, did you ever...

3343
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:05,400
Well, actually...

3344
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:06,120
Do they...

3345
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:07,200
If you have kids...

3346
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:09,040
Do you have kids?

3347
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:11,260
What if we do?

3348
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:13,000
Do they still do...

3349
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:16,080
Do they still do...

3350
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:16,640
Um...

3351
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:19,200
Take your child to work day?

3352
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:20,760
So, will you be a part-time worker?

3353
02:11:29,070 --> 02:11:30,750
I'm too ruthless to have kids.

3354
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:33,890
But I visited my dad at work.

3355
02:11:34,390 --> 02:11:34,870
Fun!

3356
02:11:35,210 --> 02:11:39,290
I think I did that, the take your child to work once before.

3357
02:11:41,230 --> 02:11:41,710
But...

3358
02:11:42,270 --> 02:11:42,750
Um...

3359
02:11:42,750 --> 02:11:43,830
My mom and my...

3360
02:11:43,830 --> 02:11:44,550
Uh...

3361
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:47,730
My mom and my dad actually worked at the same place.

3362
02:11:49,050 --> 02:11:50,350
And it was kind of...

3363
02:11:50,350 --> 02:11:50,970
How do I describe?

3364
02:11:52,230 --> 02:11:52,710
Um...

3365
02:11:54,870 --> 02:11:55,830
It was...

3366
02:11:55,830 --> 02:11:56,710
Um...

3367
02:11:56,710 --> 02:11:57,810
It was...

3368
02:11:58,850 --> 02:11:58,890
It was...

3369
02:11:58,890 --> 02:11:59,190
Like...

3370
02:11:59,190 --> 02:12:01,230
Kind of constructionish?

3371
02:12:02,870 --> 02:12:03,350
So...

3372
02:12:03,350 --> 02:12:04,570
I didn't do anything.

3373
02:12:04,830 --> 02:12:06,290
I just sat in the office.

3374
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:07,130
And like...

3375
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:08,590
Didn't do anything.

3376
02:12:09,350 --> 02:12:11,170
Cause they were like, you can't go in the back.

3377
02:12:11,970 --> 02:12:12,450
You'll...

3378
02:12:12,450 --> 02:12:13,150
You'll...

3379
02:12:13,150 --> 02:12:14,090
You'll...

3380
02:12:14,090 --> 02:12:15,130
You'll lose a finger.

3381
02:12:16,450 --> 02:12:16,930
Probably.

3382
02:12:17,990 --> 02:12:19,130
Alright, let me grab my...

3383
02:12:19,130 --> 02:12:21,050
My postcards are right down here.

3384
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:22,310
Uh...

3385
02:12:26,230 --> 02:12:30,030
I have about... maybe like...

3386
02:12:32,290 --> 02:12:33,890
Maybe like 200 here?

3387
02:12:34,670 --> 02:12:37,070
So I could probably finish signing this whole...

3388
02:12:37,070 --> 02:12:39,150
Actually, maybe a little more than 200.

3389
02:12:41,530 --> 02:12:42,590
I don't know.

3390
02:12:43,390 --> 02:12:46,710
I don't think I can sign and like...

3391
02:12:46,710 --> 02:12:48,030
Oh gosh, I already messed up.

3392
02:12:49,590 --> 02:12:51,990
I don't think I can sign and talk at the same time.

3393
02:12:51,990 --> 02:12:53,570
It requires too much mental capacity.

3394
02:12:54,450 --> 02:12:54,850
Right?

3395
02:12:55,490 --> 02:12:58,950
Because I have to like... think about how I do my signature.

3396
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:00,570
Or else it ends up being...

3397
02:13:00,570 --> 02:13:01,970
I mean, I mess up all the time.

3398
02:13:02,190 --> 02:13:04,570
And it ends up being kind of ugly all the time anyway.

3399
02:13:04,830 --> 02:13:10,670
But if anyone is curious, I'm signing a postcard for the Patreon.

3400
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:14,710
I have this sick...

3401
02:13:16,210 --> 02:13:16,830
What's the word?

3402
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:20,450
My ring finger?

3403
02:13:20,450 --> 02:13:21,830
Is like...

3404
02:13:22,410 --> 02:13:24,650
It's gonna be so strong by the end of this.

3405
02:13:24,730 --> 02:13:26,430
It's gonna have the sickest callus.

3406
02:13:27,110 --> 02:13:29,050
Like I even... my skin...

3407
02:13:29,690 --> 02:13:30,570
Started breaking.

3408
02:13:32,230 --> 02:13:33,370
It's okay if mine's ugly?

3409
02:13:33,550 --> 02:13:33,930
Okay.

3410
02:13:36,630 --> 02:13:37,770
Talking between signatures?

3411
02:13:38,050 --> 02:13:41,790
I've already signed five since I first started.

3412
02:13:43,870 --> 02:13:45,170
I've already signed a couple.

3413
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:49,970
You'll be able to fit so many rings on it.

3414
02:13:49,970 --> 02:13:50,430
Or none.

3415
02:13:50,710 --> 02:13:52,030
It's gonna be so...

3416
02:13:52,030 --> 02:13:53,750
It's gonna be so...

3417
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:54,610
Beefy.

3418
02:13:55,170 --> 02:13:55,810
You know?

3419
02:13:56,390 --> 02:13:57,530
It's gonna be like...

3420
02:13:57,530 --> 02:14:00,590
The strongest ring finger to ever exist.

3421
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:03,370
It's my fault though.

3422
02:14:03,450 --> 02:14:05,170
I should have signed these like...

3423
02:14:05,170 --> 02:14:05,690
Because...

3424
02:14:05,690 --> 02:14:07,650
Basically, I'm taking...

3425
02:14:10,050 --> 02:14:11,090
A few.

3426
02:14:12,250 --> 02:14:13,070
I mean...

3427
02:14:13,070 --> 02:14:13,650
I say a few.

3428
02:14:13,910 --> 02:14:15,070
I'm taking about...

3429
02:14:15,070 --> 02:14:16,350
2,000.

3430
02:14:17,470 --> 02:14:19,490
To Matara when I see her.

3431
02:14:21,210 --> 02:14:22,390
Well, I say to Matara.

3432
02:14:23,190 --> 02:14:26,610
But I'm passing them off when I see her this weekend at Otakutan.

3433
02:14:28,050 --> 02:14:28,990
I'm saying, okay.

3434
02:14:29,750 --> 02:14:30,810
Put it in your suitcase.

3435
02:14:30,950 --> 02:14:32,270
Your responsibility now.

3436
02:14:33,830 --> 02:14:34,710
I hope it fits.

3437
02:14:34,970 --> 02:14:36,090
I basically was just like...

3438
02:14:36,090 --> 02:14:36,510
Don't...

3439
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:38,470
Don't bring a lot of stuff.

3440
02:14:38,710 --> 02:14:39,670
Bring your biggest suitcase.

3441
02:14:41,850 --> 02:14:42,310
And...

3442
02:14:45,390 --> 02:14:46,950
But that's just two months.

3443
02:14:46,990 --> 02:14:49,630
And that's including the recent ones that we have to...

3444
02:14:49,630 --> 02:14:50,850
That I had to do.

3445
02:14:50,910 --> 02:14:51,870
Which was kind of hellish.

3446
02:14:52,070 --> 02:14:52,430
Because...

3447
02:14:52,430 --> 02:14:53,890
I was just like, oh my gosh.

3448
02:14:53,950 --> 02:14:55,750
I felt like I just signed all of these.

3449
02:14:55,810 --> 02:14:58,230
And now I'm having to sign all of them again.

3450
02:15:00,230 --> 02:15:01,430
How much do postcards weigh?

3451
02:15:02,010 --> 02:15:03,810
Well, that's why I was gonna bring more.

3452
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:06,810
But one, I don't think I can sign.

3453
02:15:07,930 --> 02:15:10,050
I was like, maybe I'll bring three months worth.

3454
02:15:10,850 --> 02:15:12,570
But I don't think I can sign that many.

3455
02:15:13,210 --> 02:15:14,850
And again, it's my fault.

3456
02:15:14,930 --> 02:15:15,870
I should have signed them sooner.

3457
02:15:18,830 --> 02:15:21,030
Because, truth be told, I got these.

3458
02:15:21,130 --> 02:15:23,170
I came back from Anime Expo.

3459
02:15:23,590 --> 02:15:24,810
And I had them.

3460
02:15:24,870 --> 02:15:26,030
They had been delivered.

3461
02:15:27,770 --> 02:15:30,090
So I've had them for some time now.

3462
02:15:30,330 --> 02:15:33,650
But I was like, oh, I'll get to it.

3463
02:15:34,450 --> 02:15:36,350
Who's your personal favorite Metal Gear character?

3464
02:15:36,590 --> 02:15:38,550
Personally, I love Oss a lot.

3465
02:15:40,370 --> 02:15:42,070
I also love Oss...

3466
02:15:43,770 --> 02:15:45,750
Ossalot's forgotten twin brother.

3467
02:15:47,190 --> 02:15:47,630
Brother?

3468
02:15:52,510 --> 02:15:54,710
I thought you weren't signing the replacement ones.

3469
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:55,290
Oh no!

3470
02:15:58,920 --> 02:15:59,820
We signed them.

3471
02:16:00,100 --> 02:16:01,080
Or I signed them.

3472
02:16:04,420 --> 02:16:04,860
Why?

3473
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:06,380
Did Matara say we weren't gonna sign them?

3474
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:10,360
Did I sign all of them for...

3475
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:20,240
Top Blue Archive characters?

3476
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:23,920
Koharu?

3477
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:25,720
Cherry's...

3478
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:26,500
Hina.

3479
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:33,840
You both said it.

3480
02:16:45,530 --> 02:16:46,430
Kanna's your fav?

3481
02:16:46,570 --> 02:16:47,290
Kanna's so cool.

3482
02:16:53,510 --> 02:16:54,530
Kanna's really cool.

3483
02:16:54,770 --> 02:16:55,170
I like her.

3484
02:16:55,250 --> 02:16:56,450
Her... also her...

3485
02:16:57,210 --> 02:16:58,570
Her attack is really good.

3486
02:16:59,590 --> 02:17:01,730
Basically, what she does is she like...

3487
02:17:03,210 --> 02:17:05,410
You target a character.

3488
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:07,150
You target like a little...

3489
02:17:07,150 --> 02:17:07,710
I don't know.

3490
02:17:07,710 --> 02:17:08,430
How do I say it?

3491
02:17:08,430 --> 02:17:08,710
A villain?

3492
02:17:10,010 --> 02:17:10,450
And...

3493
02:17:11,390 --> 02:17:11,830
She...

3494
02:17:13,450 --> 02:17:13,970
Arrests them.

3495
02:17:14,250 --> 02:17:15,450
And then it builds up.

3496
02:17:15,530 --> 02:17:17,010
And like does a giant explosion.

3497
02:17:17,010 --> 02:17:18,210
And it's so helpful.

3498
02:17:21,410 --> 02:17:22,270
Serika, my beloved.

3499
02:17:22,410 --> 02:17:23,610
I always call her Azunyan.

3500
02:17:24,210 --> 02:17:25,710
Because she looks just like...

3501
02:17:26,250 --> 02:17:27,130
Azunyan from...

3502
02:17:27,890 --> 02:17:28,870
From K-On!

3503
02:17:31,770 --> 02:17:32,210
Only...

3504
02:17:32,210 --> 02:17:32,630
Only...

3505
02:17:32,630 --> 02:17:33,910
Kind of recently...

3506
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:35,630
Did I like...

3507
02:17:35,630 --> 02:17:37,070
Call her...

3508
02:17:37,070 --> 02:17:38,370
Start calling her Serika.

3509
02:17:39,790 --> 02:17:41,290
Baselot over Osnaticon?

3510
02:17:41,350 --> 02:17:41,990
So true.

3511
02:17:42,310 --> 02:17:43,470
So true, Bessie.

3512
02:17:43,650 --> 02:17:44,850
You're in a safe place...

3513
02:17:44,850 --> 02:17:45,330
Safe...

3514
02:17:45,330 --> 02:17:45,850
Space.

3515
02:17:46,370 --> 02:17:48,270
I love Baselot so much.

3516
02:17:53,520 --> 02:17:54,840
They do look alike.

3517
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:57,220
It's just that trope, you know?

3518
02:17:57,800 --> 02:17:58,380
The...

3519
02:17:58,380 --> 02:17:59,640
Black haired...

3520
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:00,500
Twin tailed...

3521
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:01,880
And...

3522
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:03,260
But also like her uniform too.

3523
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:04,760
She's got like the...

3524
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:05,880
The...

3525
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:07,100
Little bow tie...

3526
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:08,200
The blazer...

3527
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:09,980
And the red bow tie...

3528
02:18:09,980 --> 02:18:10,200
And...

3529
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:10,760
You know...

3530
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:15,680
Did you know Ayami-sensei has a character in Blue Archive?

3531
02:18:22,900 --> 02:18:26,840
The reason Mint's hands are like that is because her hands got tired from signing postcards.

3532
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:31,700
No...

3533
02:18:31,700 --> 02:18:33,560
Honestly, I feel like I can sign...

3534
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:35,840
Like my hand doesn't get so tired.

3535
02:18:36,420 --> 02:18:38,280
It's just a matter of speed.

3536
02:18:38,660 --> 02:18:39,040
You know?

3537
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:40,540
Doshi?

3538
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:40,880
Yeah!

3539
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:41,480
Shimiko!

3540
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:46,160
Shimiko is...

3541
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:48,520
Ayami-sensei's...

3542
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:49,900
Art.

3543
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:51,200
But...

3544
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:52,100
I feel bad.

3545
02:18:52,180 --> 02:18:53,840
I wish she was more popular of a character.

3546
02:18:55,560 --> 02:18:57,460
I'm pretty sure she's also just a one star.

3547
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:58,480
So...

3548
02:18:58,480 --> 02:19:00,800
It was fun seeing you multiple days at A5!

3549
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:04,440
I don't know why I thought I should do a cartwheel for you on Saturday.

3550
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:05,060
I'm...

3551
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:10,540
I was fine with it.

3552
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:11,980
I think staff was just like...

3553
02:19:11,980 --> 02:19:12,360
Hey, buddy.

3554
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:13,360
What are you doing?

3555
02:19:21,380 --> 02:19:22,260
So funny.

3556
02:19:23,380 --> 02:19:24,300
Oh, my gosh.

3557
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:25,040
Everybody...

3558
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:27,220
Oh, I should talk about Anime Fest, huh?

3559
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:27,800
It was so fun.

3560
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:29,800
I was at a...

3561
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:32,740
I did a convention appearance this past weekend.

3562
02:19:32,940 --> 02:19:36,040
Apparently, it was like their last year or something?

3563
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:37,760
For the convention?

3564
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:40,340
Which is pretty crazy.

3565
02:19:43,640 --> 02:19:43,920
But...

3566
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:45,400
I'm...

3567
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:48,100
It was so funny the amount of people that were just like...

3568
02:19:48,540 --> 02:19:49,740
I don't really know who you are.

3569
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:51,200
I just came to see you.

3570
02:19:51,580 --> 02:19:55,580
I don't know who you are, but in your bio on the website, it said you liked Metal Gear.

3571
02:19:57,020 --> 02:19:57,960
So I was like...

3572
02:19:57,960 --> 02:19:58,120
What?

3573
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:02,820
Someone came up to me dressed as Snake and was just like...

3574
02:20:02,820 --> 02:20:04,500
I found out about you like 30 minutes ago.

3575
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:07,540
Crazy.

3576
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:14,000
If you watch me...

3577
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:14,780
Thanks.

3578
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:19,870
Cool to see you on the panel.

3579
02:20:19,970 --> 02:20:20,110
Yeah.

3580
02:20:21,170 --> 02:20:21,890
That's sad.

3581
02:20:22,230 --> 02:20:22,670
What?

3582
02:20:22,730 --> 02:20:23,670
That it's last year?

3583
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:23,990
Yeah.

3584
02:20:24,790 --> 02:20:27,290
I don't know what the dealio is, but...

3585
02:20:29,770 --> 02:20:34,730
I'm honored to have been part of the last year of a convention that's been going on for many, many years.

3586
02:20:35,890 --> 02:20:36,990
I would like to...

3587
02:20:38,390 --> 02:20:40,330
Go to Texas for real one day.

3588
02:20:42,390 --> 02:20:43,490
I've been trying to...

3589
02:20:44,090 --> 02:20:46,650
You know, I've been doing a lot of events and stuff.

3590
02:20:46,790 --> 02:20:47,750
But I've just been...

3591
02:20:48,490 --> 02:20:54,350
My main goal is to try and go to as many new places as I possibly can because...

3592
02:20:55,630 --> 02:20:58,350
Not just for me because, you know, some of them are digitally.

3593
02:20:58,730 --> 02:21:04,690
But just because I know not everybody could go to California four times a year.

3594
02:21:06,570 --> 02:21:07,050
So...

3595
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:12,840
Careful, I hear they have cowboys there.

3596
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:15,860
Yee-haw.

3597
02:21:16,340 --> 02:21:18,140
Oh, that signature was not pretty.

3598
02:21:18,220 --> 02:21:18,660
Sorry.

3599
02:21:19,860 --> 02:21:20,600
So sorry.

3600
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:23,860
My signature is getting uglier and uglier.

3601
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:28,920
Meanwhile, me stuck on the East Coast.

3602
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:30,740
I'll be honest.

3603
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:32,780
I tried to get...

3604
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:34,880
So for like...

3605
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:36,240
The podcast, right?

3606
02:21:36,580 --> 02:21:38,940
Some of our convention appearances was...

3607
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:40,360
Kind of...

3608
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:42,560
Because Matar is involved.

3609
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:45,980
It was V-Shojo trying to help us out.

3610
02:21:46,180 --> 02:21:48,300
And reaching out to cons and stuff as well.

3611
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:49,840
And I was like...

3612
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:52,500
Please more East Coast conventions for us.

3613
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:56,840
But a lot of them also fall within...

3614
02:21:57,500 --> 02:21:59,840
Or fall out of the range of the podcast.

3615
02:22:01,420 --> 02:22:02,060
So...

3616
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:04,620
Can't really do much about...

3617
02:22:04,620 --> 02:22:09,040
Can't really do a podcast thing...

3618
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:11,860
When it is out of...

3619
02:22:11,860 --> 02:22:13,700
You know, we end the podcast in September.

3620
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:14,800
So...

3621
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:14,940
But...

3622
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:18,580
That's kind of why it...

3623
02:22:19,240 --> 02:22:20,240
Didn't work out.

3624
02:22:27,530 --> 02:22:28,530
Well, okay.

3625
02:22:28,630 --> 02:22:29,170
I'm done with this.

3626
02:22:29,410 --> 02:22:31,830
I grabbed little stacks at a time.

3627
02:22:31,970 --> 02:22:32,370
So...

3628
02:22:32,980 --> 02:22:34,090
Done with this little stack.

3629
02:22:35,650 --> 02:22:36,150
Oops.

3630
02:22:36,470 --> 02:22:37,190
There we go.

3631
02:22:38,430 --> 02:22:39,950
Let me grab another little stack.

3632
02:22:46,490 --> 02:22:47,810
Sad but understandable.

3633
02:22:48,730 --> 02:22:49,230
Yeah.

3634
02:22:52,490 --> 02:22:55,230
But also I'd like to go more outside of the US as well.

3635
02:23:00,350 --> 02:23:01,990
Just places I've never been before.

3636
02:23:02,790 --> 02:23:03,950
Brazilian in shambles.

3637
02:23:07,350 --> 02:23:09,710
I don't even know what we're waiting for to be honest.

3638
02:23:09,750 --> 02:23:10,910
I just like spending time with you guys.

3639
02:23:13,870 --> 02:23:14,890
Aside from Japan?

3640
02:23:15,370 --> 02:23:16,170
What do you mean?

3641
02:23:17,010 --> 02:23:19,250
No, I just mean events and stuff.

3642
02:23:20,010 --> 02:23:21,070
I just mean events.

3643
02:23:21,930 --> 02:23:22,490
But...

3644
02:23:22,490 --> 02:23:24,970
My times going to Japan...

3645
02:23:24,970 --> 02:23:25,790
I mean, I'm going to Japan.

3646
02:23:26,690 --> 02:23:27,450
Oh gosh.

3647
02:23:28,050 --> 02:23:29,730
Am I going to Japan next week?

3648
02:23:31,690 --> 02:23:33,370
I'm going to Japan next week!

3649
02:23:34,010 --> 02:23:35,130
Oh golly.

3650
02:23:35,450 --> 02:23:37,470
I'm going but it's all for work.

3651
02:23:39,290 --> 02:23:40,750
It's for work you guys.

3652
02:23:40,990 --> 02:23:41,910
It's not...

3653
02:23:41,910 --> 02:23:43,670
Oh gosh.

3654
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:46,510
Busy, busy.

3655
02:23:47,690 --> 02:23:50,930
A little pause, guys...

3656
02:23:50,930 --> 02:23:51,050
I think I'm going to Japan.

3657
02:23:55,790 --> 02:23:56,750
No pleasure.

3658
02:24:00,900 --> 02:24:06,040
But I'm excited because there's some people I'll be meeting.

3659
02:24:06,380 --> 02:24:11,420
I asked Ayami-sensei if she wanted to do an off-collab.

3660
02:24:11,580 --> 02:24:13,080
So we'll probably be doing that.

3661
02:24:13,400 --> 02:24:17,220
I'm just saying if there's Mintomido somewhere in Southeast Asia, I'll probably fly there.

3662
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:25,020
Wins!

3663
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:25,980
Thank you so much for the peek!

3664
02:24:25,980 --> 02:24:28,580
Anime Fest was my first con and you made it a blast.

3665
02:24:28,820 --> 02:24:30,420
Shoutout to your superfans that showed up.

3666
02:24:30,460 --> 02:24:33,320
I got to take fan group photos and say I'm better for you.

3667
02:24:33,360 --> 02:24:34,120
It was an amazing experience.

3668
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:36,380
That's so sweet!

3669
02:24:39,220 --> 02:24:40,280
That's so sweet.

3670
02:24:41,540 --> 02:24:42,740
I'm so glad you had fun.

3671
02:24:43,140 --> 02:24:45,620
Please don't feel obligated to stream often while you're there.

3672
02:24:45,820 --> 02:24:47,840
I'm gonna do my best.

3673
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:52,580
I kinda don't know how the first week will go while I'm there.

3674
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:55,460
But I definitely know after the first week I'll be free.

3675
02:24:57,840 --> 02:24:59,140
Until Annie-sama!

3676
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:03,460
I'm so excited for Annie-sama!

3677
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:08,360
You guys, I'm going to be seeing Ogura Yui for the first time!

3678
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:10,080
Live!

3679
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,280
Oh my gosh!

3680
02:25:13,060 --> 02:25:14,600
I'm so excited!

3681
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:18,560
Oh my gosh, if you don't know, Ogura Yui is my...

3682
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:21,280
She's my seiyuu-oshi.

3683
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:24,560
I love her so much.

3684
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:25,960
I've never been able to see her before.

3685
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:27,620
I'm so excited!

3686
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:31,660
Oh my gosh.

3687
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:33,200
And Denpagumi will be performing.

3688
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:34,760
And...

3689
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:38,180
I got tickets for...

3690
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:40,600
Not everyday.

3691
02:25:41,820 --> 02:25:44,500
But oh my gosh, it's my first Annie-sama too.

3692
02:25:47,140 --> 02:25:48,660
So I'm very excited.

3693
02:25:49,500 --> 02:25:51,520
Very, very, very excited.

3694
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:55,860
Isn't she the VA for Shiroko?

3695
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:56,500
She is!

3696
02:25:57,020 --> 02:25:59,540
Yes, she's the VA for Shiroko from Blue Archive.

3697
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:01,460
Which is why I love Shiroko.

3698
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:03,720
But also, I just like Shiroko's character too.

3699
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:08,080
I came for Shiroko.

3700
02:26:08,260 --> 02:26:10,420
Stayed for everything else, pretty much.

3701
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:16,720
I did all three days of Annie-sama in 2022.

3702
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:18,740
It was fun, but I fell asleep every day.

3703
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:22,480
Yeah.

3704
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:24,320
Yeah.

3705
02:26:24,820 --> 02:26:25,120
Yeah.

3706
02:26:25,480 --> 02:26:25,940
Yeah.

3707
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:30,800
I don't think I could do more than three days.

3708
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:31,660
I'll be honest.

3709
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:33,220
It's also a lot.

3710
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:33,760
I'm just like...

3711
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:36,500
Just that much noise and stimulation and everything.

3712
02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:37,800
Like every day is...

3713
02:26:38,480 --> 02:26:39,720
Would be so much.

3714
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:42,540
The current time FGO...

3715
02:26:43,860 --> 02:26:44,740
Even is...

3716
02:26:46,060 --> 02:26:48,460
Scotty getting a Holy Grail and creating an Endless Summer.

3717
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:53,300
So you're saying I need a Holy Grail to make a Mint and Matara Endless Summer Podcast PRV?

3718
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:56,300
No, please.

3719
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:57,160
End my suffering.

3720
02:26:57,800 --> 02:26:58,940
Don't do this to me.

3721
02:26:59,140 --> 02:27:01,340
Why are you making me suffer?

3722
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:02,280
Why?

3723
02:27:04,580 --> 02:27:07,300
An eternal summer with Matara?

3724
02:27:08,220 --> 02:27:09,720
Don't do this to me, please.

3725
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:14,560
Plan.

3726
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:16,500
Learn to astral project to see Minto icons.

3727
02:27:17,360 --> 02:27:18,580
I'll try to come to you.

3728
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:20,280
I don't know where you are, but...

3729
02:27:20,280 --> 02:27:23,280
I first got exposed to Yui Ogura from...

3730
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:24,180
Yui Kaori.

3731
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:25,140
Me too, actually.

3732
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:27,300
Space guy, right?

3733
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:28,540
Welcome to Membu ship.

3734
02:27:28,660 --> 02:27:29,060
Thank you.

3735
02:27:29,580 --> 02:27:30,840
And thank you for the 10 gifted.

3736
02:27:30,980 --> 02:27:31,680
Thank you so much.

3737
02:27:32,060 --> 02:27:32,420
Thank you.

3738
02:27:33,020 --> 02:27:35,660
Yeah, I love Yui Kaori.

3739
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:44,730
I love them so much.

3740
02:27:46,290 --> 02:27:46,690
I...

3741
02:27:48,310 --> 02:27:49,750
Used to do...

3742
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:53,250
Wait, I just arrived back.

3743
02:27:53,350 --> 02:27:54,030
Did she say yes?

3744
02:27:56,850 --> 02:27:57,250
Oh.

3745
02:27:59,250 --> 02:27:59,530
Huh?

3746
02:28:08,490 --> 02:28:09,610
What was I going to say?

3747
02:28:13,090 --> 02:28:15,190
You know, before I...

3748
02:28:15,790 --> 02:28:17,290
Did this maid cafe...

3749
02:28:17,910 --> 02:28:20,870
I did some maid cafes at anime conventions.

3750
02:28:21,230 --> 02:28:22,070
And so I...

3751
02:28:23,370 --> 02:28:23,930
I...

3752
02:28:24,930 --> 02:28:26,250
Learned Yui Kaori dances.

3753
02:28:28,570 --> 02:28:30,250
My favorite one is puppy love.

3754
02:28:30,590 --> 02:28:33,050
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

3755
02:28:33,090 --> 02:28:33,390
Hi.

3756
02:28:33,710 --> 02:28:35,590
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

3757
02:28:35,590 --> 02:28:37,850
Do kyun doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

3758
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:38,350
Say no.

3759
02:28:38,530 --> 02:28:39,390
Puppy love.

3760
02:28:39,570 --> 02:28:40,550
Pu puppy love.

3761
02:28:42,590 --> 02:28:43,010
Phantom.

3762
02:28:43,910 --> 02:28:45,750
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

3763
02:28:45,790 --> 02:28:46,450
Thank you so much.

3764
02:28:46,610 --> 02:28:48,190
Can't wait to see you at Otaku-tan this weekend.

3765
02:28:48,570 --> 02:28:49,670
See you there, everybody.

3766
02:28:54,290 --> 02:28:55,130
See you.

3767
02:28:55,130 --> 02:28:55,530
See you there.

3768
02:29:05,350 --> 02:29:05,770
Pu puppy love.

3769
02:29:05,770 --> 02:29:07,990
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

3770
02:29:08,030 --> 02:29:08,970
Pu puppy love.

3771
02:29:09,130 --> 02:29:10,150
Pu puppy love.

3772
02:29:10,370 --> 02:29:10,650
Pu puppy love.

3773
02:29:17,340 --> 02:29:17,860
Pu puppy love.

3774
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:19,400
Pu puppy love.

3775
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:20,940
Pu puppy love.

3776
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:26,600
Pu puppy love.

3777
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:26,820
Pu puppy love.

3778
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:29,800
Pu puppy love.

3779
02:29:29,820 --> 02:29:30,360
Pu puppy love.

3780
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:31,360
Pu puppy love.

3781
02:29:31,360 --> 02:29:31,860
Pu puppy love.

3782
02:29:31,860 --> 02:29:32,100
Pu puppy love.

3783
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:32,460
Pu puppy love.

3784
02:29:32,460 --> 02:29:32,940
Pu puppy love.

3785
02:29:32,940 --> 02:29:33,440
Pu puppy love.

3786
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:33,460
Pu puppy love.

3787
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:35,500
Pu puppy love.

3788
02:29:36,140 --> 02:29:37,540
Pu puppy love.

3789
02:29:39,300 --> 02:29:40,380
Pu puppy love.

3790
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:41,740
Pu puppy love.

3791
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:42,440
Why don't you go back?

3792
02:29:43,860 --> 02:29:46,180
Unless it's like a distance thing or money thing.

3793
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:47,100
I get it.

3794
02:29:51,880 --> 02:29:53,540
Oh, but I won't be able to...

3795
02:29:54,820 --> 02:29:56,820
I won't be able to stream me polling.

3796
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:57,480
Is that okay?

3797
02:29:58,820 --> 02:29:59,780
Do you guys mind?

3798
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:01,600
You'll just hear my reactions.

3799
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:03,120
My disappointment.

3800
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:06,460
You'll hear my disappointment.

3801
02:30:09,060 --> 02:30:10,700
For me, it's distance and money.

3802
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:12,300
Other side of country and I'm broke.

3803
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:13,380
Wait, I'm sorry.

3804
02:30:16,380 --> 02:30:18,340
But other side of country...

3805
02:30:18,340 --> 02:30:19,880
That means you're West Coast, right?

3806
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:22,140
That means you get a lot of stuff.

3807
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:25,980
I feel the West Coast gets so much stuff.

3808
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:30,540
The Napping Koala!

3809
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:32,360
Welcome to Mambusha Park.

3810
02:30:33,340 --> 02:30:35,680
What a koala-ty name.

3811
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:41,560
Highest...

3812
02:30:41,560 --> 02:30:43,500
The price of the highest Patreon tier?

3813
02:30:43,500 --> 02:30:45,000
I believe it's $25.

3814
02:30:45,900 --> 02:30:48,620
And that's what gets you the postcard.

3815
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:51,220
Sorry.

3816
02:30:59,660 --> 02:31:01,820
Checking stuff for Otakutan, actually.

3817
02:31:03,580 --> 02:31:05,580
Meanwhile, us Midwesterners...

3818
02:31:05,580 --> 02:31:06,980
I'm sorry, Joshua.

3819
02:31:11,160 --> 02:31:13,040
You can still get the postcards?

3820
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:16,940
Well, you'll get it starting from the...

3821
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:19,180
When you join, right?

3822
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:19,700
Yeah.

3823
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:25,140
I know we're late with sending them out.

3824
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:25,700
I'm so sorry.

3825
02:31:25,820 --> 02:31:27,180
But we're basically doing it like...

3826
02:31:27,180 --> 02:31:28,140
We're checking each month.

3827
02:31:28,240 --> 02:31:30,860
So each month we'll get a batch, you know?

3828
02:31:30,940 --> 02:31:33,620
So this one...

3829
02:31:33,620 --> 02:31:35,900
The one I signed for before was...

3830
02:31:35,900 --> 02:31:36,740
Oh gosh, April.

3831
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,320
And then I'm signing for May.

3832
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:41,540
And then, you know...

3833
02:31:44,500 --> 02:31:46,000
We'll send it out to the May people.

3834
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:48,000
And then...

3835
02:31:51,900 --> 02:31:52,800
I've only gotten one so far.

3836
02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:55,520
Yeah, because we've only sent out one.

3837
02:31:59,020 --> 02:32:00,640
I think, you know...

3838
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:04,880
Had it been not signed, it would have gone out way faster.

3839
02:32:05,020 --> 02:32:10,680
But it's hard to actually have us meet up, you know?

3840
02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:11,320
Because...

3841
02:32:14,220 --> 02:32:20,400
Essentially, I'm gonna be probably taking a couple stacks to Otakutan.

3842
02:32:20,600 --> 02:32:21,840
And handing them off to...

3843
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:22,260
Matara.

3844
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:25,580
And then her signing her side.

3845
02:32:25,780 --> 02:32:27,160
And then shipping them when she can.

3846
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:30,280
And then the next stack...

3847
02:32:30,280 --> 02:32:32,060
I'm gonna take with me to Japan.

3848
02:32:32,700 --> 02:32:36,700
So I'm gonna be holding on to them for like a whole month until I see her.

3849
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:40,440
And then doing that.

3850
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:45,000
And then probably the last batch, I'll ship to her after I'm finished signing them.

3851
02:32:45,220 --> 02:32:47,300
Because I guess we met up...

3852
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:49,980
Or rather, we didn't meet up as much as we thought we would.

3853
02:32:50,680 --> 02:32:51,160
And...

3854
02:32:51,660 --> 02:32:52,540
Other things...

3855
02:32:52,540 --> 02:32:53,240
Other times...

3856
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:55,160
Like for Anime Expo, we thought we would...

3857
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:56,520
Well...

3858
02:32:56,520 --> 02:32:58,740
Honestly, they didn't come in time for Anime Expo.

3859
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:00,700
Which was my fault.

3860
02:33:00,900 --> 02:33:03,440
Because I was in charge of ordering them and...

3861
02:33:04,940 --> 02:33:05,680
You know...

3862
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:06,340
I was...

3863
02:33:07,220 --> 02:33:07,660
Yeah...

3864
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:10,300
But...

3865
02:33:10,300 --> 02:33:12,340
Our postcards will have traveled the world!

3866
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:13,400
Pretty much, right?

3867
02:33:14,460 --> 02:33:16,740
I have social anxiety for big gatherings like conventions.

3868
02:33:17,360 --> 02:33:20,140
Maybe I can rope an older brother into going with me to one somewhere.

3869
02:33:20,380 --> 02:33:20,960
It's definitely...

3870
02:33:21,740 --> 02:33:23,800
More fun to have someone with you, right?

3871
02:33:24,540 --> 02:33:25,800
Than to go by yourself.

3872
02:33:26,100 --> 02:33:26,540
But...

3873
02:33:26,540 --> 02:33:27,340
You know...

3874
02:33:27,340 --> 02:33:28,700
If you were to go to a con...

3875
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:31,040
With other Wisps there...

3876
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:32,060
Like if...

3877
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:32,360
Say...

3878
02:33:32,360 --> 02:33:34,760
If you go to a con where I'm guesting and...

3879
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:36,160
Um...

3880
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:38,480
Other people were going to come to see me...

3881
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:40,220
I'm sure you would make friends.

3882
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:42,960
Or even other VTuber...

3883
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:45,380
VTuber communities are usually so nice, you know?

3884
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:47,980
And very...

3885
02:33:48,580 --> 02:33:49,060
Welcoming.

3886
02:33:49,060 --> 02:33:50,100
I think.

3887
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,360
Come to South America?

3888
02:34:01,130 --> 02:34:03,070
If I get invited to a place...

3889
02:34:03,070 --> 02:34:04,670
I had someone at Anime Fest!

3890
02:34:04,870 --> 02:34:05,730
They came from Mexico!

3891
02:34:06,930 --> 02:34:08,190
And I was like...

3892
02:34:09,030 --> 02:34:11,870
I'll try and go to a Mexico convention.

3893
02:34:13,970 --> 02:34:14,830
Or somewhere.

3894
02:34:15,050 --> 02:34:15,470
I don't know.

3895
02:34:15,950 --> 02:34:17,090
Go to Brazil!

3896
02:34:23,140 --> 02:34:25,560
It says a great big fan community member to come here.

3897
02:34:30,200 --> 02:34:31,940
I'm like the Grinch.

3898
02:34:32,240 --> 02:34:35,280
Her heart grew three sizes that day.

3899
02:34:39,640 --> 02:34:40,260
Japan?

3900
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:44,820
Maybe one day.

3901
02:34:44,940 --> 02:34:46,980
I'll be big in Japan.

3902
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:50,840
Maybe one day.

3903
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:52,480
Purple Helios!

3904
02:34:52,560 --> 02:34:53,200
Thanks for the membership!

3905
02:34:53,220 --> 02:34:53,660
Thank you!

3906
02:34:54,760 --> 02:34:56,240
Though, you know...

3907
02:34:56,980 --> 02:34:59,720
I feel... it's like... I don't know.

3908
02:34:59,800 --> 02:35:01,660
I always go back and forth with like...

3909
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:08,320
How do I say?

3910
02:35:08,940 --> 02:35:16,420
Growing bigger as a content creator so I can get more opportunities and reach more worldwide and things like that, but...

3911
02:35:19,360 --> 02:35:21,000
Also, you know...

3912
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:23,460
I feel like that kind of mentality...

3913
02:35:24,200 --> 02:35:25,400
Is a lot of pressure.

3914
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:27,740
And I feel quite comfortable where I'm at.

3915
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:29,360
So...

3916
02:35:30,060 --> 02:35:30,500
Kevin!

3917
02:35:30,600 --> 02:35:31,300
Welcome to the membership!

3918
02:35:31,300 --> 02:35:31,860
Thank you!

3919
02:35:34,140 --> 02:35:35,500
I don't want to become...

3920
02:35:36,220 --> 02:35:37,620
Someone who... you know...

3921
02:35:37,620 --> 02:35:39,660
And obviously I do think about like...

3922
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:45,200
Numbers and subscribers and things like that, but...

3923
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:48,600
I don't want to become someone who focuses only on that kind of stuff.

3924
02:35:50,240 --> 02:35:51,340
Mint's US tour win?

3925
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:52,800
I need to see Mint in Minnesota!

3926
02:35:53,660 --> 02:35:54,360
What's in Minnesota?

3927
02:35:55,060 --> 02:35:55,540
Cows?

3928
02:35:56,360 --> 02:35:57,600
I want to see some cows.

3929
02:36:04,710 --> 02:36:05,230
Thank you!

3930
02:36:05,530 --> 02:36:05,830
Thank you!

3931
02:36:07,030 --> 02:36:08,830
If you're gonna leave...

3932
02:36:09,630 --> 02:36:10,490
20 more minutes.

3933
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:14,710
Oh no, maybe I won't finish this stack before...

3934
02:36:16,930 --> 02:36:17,890
Before time.

3935
02:36:19,730 --> 02:36:22,330
After the podcast, are you going to need more sub tiers?

3936
02:36:22,710 --> 02:36:23,470
For the cafe?

3937
02:36:24,470 --> 02:36:25,730
No, I don't think so.

3938
02:36:27,150 --> 02:36:27,890
No, I don't think so.

3939
02:36:27,890 --> 02:36:28,350
Memberships?

3940
02:36:29,570 --> 02:36:30,090
Nah.

3941
02:36:32,910 --> 02:36:33,910
I am...

3942
02:36:35,430 --> 02:36:36,290
Entirely comfortable.

3943
02:36:38,370 --> 02:36:40,570
It was nice to meet you at Anime Fest Thursday.

3944
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:42,330
It was my first ever meet and greet and I'm glad...

3945
02:36:42,330 --> 02:36:45,090
To know I'll never be forgotten for my ballsy mood...

3946
02:36:45,090 --> 02:36:46,690
In front of everyone.

3947
02:36:48,270 --> 02:36:51,070
Working retail has forever changed me.

3948
02:36:53,830 --> 02:36:55,730
Thank you, Magic Doodoo Johnson.

3949
02:36:55,910 --> 02:36:56,870
I really appreciate it.

3950
02:36:58,250 --> 02:36:59,630
Give us higher tiers.

3951
02:36:59,910 --> 02:37:00,190
Why?

3952
02:37:02,810 --> 02:37:03,770
Why, Anthony?

3953
02:37:06,110 --> 02:37:07,670
Why do you want higher tiers?

3954
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:16,600
Can there be a membership tier where we watch Nacho Libre once a month asking for a friend?

3955
02:37:16,820 --> 02:37:18,080
Only if...

3956
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:18,600
No.

3957
02:37:20,060 --> 02:37:20,600
No.

3958
02:37:29,160 --> 02:37:29,720
Yes.

3959
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:37,680
I literally watched it from the Patreon and you missed it, Raymac.

3960
02:37:37,740 --> 02:37:38,460
That's your fault.

3961
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:41,120
Oh my gosh, you made me mess up my signature.

3962
02:37:42,360 --> 02:37:43,560
No, it's ugly.

3963
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:48,860
I like making the little ghost's eyes so derpy.

3964
02:37:49,260 --> 02:37:51,760
Came back from a con Sunday, your tricks help a lot.

3965
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:52,720
Really?

3966
02:37:55,420 --> 02:37:56,540
Thanks, Solin!

3967
02:37:56,540 --> 02:37:56,900
Thanks, Solin.

3968
02:37:56,900 --> 02:37:57,140
What is this?

3969
02:37:58,440 --> 02:37:59,880
Thanks for trying them.

3970
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:01,160
So happy.

3971
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:03,100
What was the most effective?

3972
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:06,500
Okay, here's the post-con survey.

3973
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:08,580
What was most effective?

3974
02:38:09,080 --> 02:38:10,400
Konnichiwa, konnichiwa!

3975
02:38:17,390 --> 02:38:19,010
Hope the ugly one is sent to me.

3976
02:38:19,090 --> 02:38:20,410
They're all ugly, don't worry.

3977
02:38:25,070 --> 02:38:27,090
But sometimes I do...

3978
02:38:27,090 --> 02:38:28,310
Instead of like...

3979
02:38:28,970 --> 02:38:31,170
Eyeballs, I do winky eyeballs.

3980
02:38:32,130 --> 02:38:32,770
So...

3981
02:38:32,770 --> 02:38:35,710
Some people get a special winky face.

3982
02:38:39,210 --> 02:38:41,450
In fact, this one will be a winky face.

3983
02:38:42,950 --> 02:38:44,910
Oh, this one is so cute actually!

3984
02:38:47,190 --> 02:38:49,090
This one is really cute.

3985
02:38:52,830 --> 02:38:54,010
Ayami-sensei sent this.

3986
02:38:54,190 --> 02:38:54,570
Eh?

3987
02:38:55,230 --> 02:38:56,470
Thank you very much!

3988
02:38:56,770 --> 02:38:58,710
Oh my god!

3989
02:38:59,490 --> 02:39:00,730
Thank you very much!

3990
02:39:01,270 --> 02:39:02,290
I love you, Ayami-sensei.

3991
02:39:05,650 --> 02:39:06,790
Teen Girl Squad.

3992
02:39:07,010 --> 02:39:08,130
Their ugly world!

3993
02:39:10,330 --> 02:39:13,230
I'm sorry, because English beer is not allowed.

3994
02:39:18,680 --> 02:39:19,980
I can't speak Japanese.

3995
02:39:22,580 --> 02:39:27,520
I had so much fun with Ayami-sensei.

3996
02:39:27,820 --> 02:39:29,460
Her panel was so much fun.

3997
02:39:33,810 --> 02:39:35,770
Mama, thanks for the five kisses!

3998
02:39:36,110 --> 02:39:37,630
Arigato, arigato.

3999
02:39:37,630 --> 02:39:39,750
I'm good at Japanese.

4000
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:10,530
It does!

4001
02:40:10,870 --> 02:40:11,470
Let's go!

4002
02:40:11,870 --> 02:40:12,390
Hot dog!

4003
02:40:13,250 --> 02:40:14,350
Hot dog moment.

4004
02:40:24,690 --> 02:40:26,370
Did Ayami get more Baja Blast?

4005
02:40:26,490 --> 02:40:29,190
Actually, both of us were there digitally, so...

4006
02:40:31,650 --> 02:40:33,370
But, we want to go back.

4007
02:40:33,810 --> 02:40:36,890
That's why we were just like, oh, it's the last year of this convention.

4008
02:40:39,830 --> 02:40:43,890
Hopefully, another Texas convention will invite us.

4009
02:40:51,440 --> 02:40:51,880
Hopefully.

4010
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:57,540
Minty Birch Kyle, thanks for the hot dog.

4011
02:40:57,760 --> 02:40:58,380
Hot dog.

4012
02:40:58,860 --> 02:41:00,420
Can my signature have a freckle?

4013
02:41:04,040 --> 02:41:05,880
Well, I don't know if you'll get it though.

4014
02:41:06,620 --> 02:41:07,500
It's the gacha.

4015
02:41:08,220 --> 02:41:09,720
Who knows which one you'll get.

4016
02:41:12,020 --> 02:41:13,040
Come to San Japan.

4017
02:41:14,160 --> 02:41:15,360
If they'll invite me.

4018
02:41:17,180 --> 02:41:19,940
I have to... maybe I do have to become more popular.

4019
02:41:20,280 --> 02:41:22,260
I have to be more desirable, you guys.

4020
02:41:24,660 --> 02:41:26,340
I have to become more desirable.

4021
02:41:27,820 --> 02:41:29,560
Can my signature have a frog?

4022
02:41:31,940 --> 02:41:34,940
What's something I should draw on this postcard?

4023
02:41:35,020 --> 02:41:35,560
Something silly.

4024
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:38,480
Not my regular signature.

4025
02:41:39,620 --> 02:41:41,420
What's something that I should draw?

4026
02:41:41,440 --> 02:41:42,020
Something silly.

4027
02:41:42,220 --> 02:41:43,720
This is the real SSR.

4028
02:41:46,320 --> 02:41:46,840
This is the real SSR.

4029
02:41:46,840 --> 02:41:46,860
Frog Bird?

4030
02:41:50,480 --> 02:41:51,700
I can try drawing...

4031
02:41:51,700 --> 02:41:55,320
I can try drawing Frog Bird.

4032
02:41:55,500 --> 02:41:55,840
Okay, hold on.

4033
02:42:07,010 --> 02:42:08,650
What is a frog...

4034
02:42:08,650 --> 02:42:09,150
Oh, here, here.

4035
02:42:09,230 --> 02:42:09,390
Okay.

4036
02:42:10,190 --> 02:42:10,710
Okay.

4037
02:42:13,620 --> 02:42:15,200
This is a real SSR.

4038
02:42:16,840 --> 02:42:18,400
This one's from Frog Bird.

4039
02:42:38,780 --> 02:42:40,140
I got a reference picture.

4040
02:42:40,280 --> 02:42:41,080
I'm drawing it now.

4041
02:42:41,960 --> 02:42:42,400
I got a reference picture.

4042
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:42,400
I'm drawing it now.

4043
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:43,000
I'll take a picture.

4044
02:42:43,740 --> 02:42:45,160
I'll take a picture of it.

4045
02:42:45,220 --> 02:42:46,640
Before I... before... you know?

4046
02:42:47,860 --> 02:42:50,480
Or should we wait and see who... if someone gets it?

4047
02:42:51,540 --> 02:42:54,180
I think Frog Bird would write with his left hand.

4048
02:42:54,360 --> 02:42:54,700
So...

4049
02:43:00,520 --> 02:43:01,340
Oh, god.

4050
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:03,620
Oh, god.

4051
02:43:03,900 --> 02:43:04,080
Oh, god.

4052
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:05,560
Writing with my left hand.

4053
02:43:06,040 --> 02:43:06,480
Writing with my left hand.

4054
02:43:08,320 --> 02:43:09,520
Oh, god.

4055
02:43:22,780 --> 02:43:24,540
I'm going to draw a little fire, too.

4056
02:43:34,770 --> 02:43:36,390
It's going to be funny if they don't watch this.

4057
02:43:36,470 --> 02:43:37,810
They're going to be like, what the hell?

4058
02:43:39,250 --> 02:43:43,430
They're going to be some Matara fan who barely knows who I am.

4059
02:43:44,450 --> 02:43:46,070
It's going to be a Momo instead.

4060
02:43:46,490 --> 02:43:48,310
They're going to be like, what is this?

4061
02:43:50,070 --> 02:43:52,910
I really hope someone Canadian gets it.

4062
02:43:57,440 --> 02:43:58,400
Oh gosh.

4063
02:44:00,620 --> 02:44:02,140
It's so ominous.

4064
02:44:04,320 --> 02:44:05,720
I'm putting it off to the side.

4065
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:06,820
I'll take a picture of it later.

4066
02:44:08,220 --> 02:44:09,580
Not knowing Minta.

4067
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:11,500
It's okay.

4068
02:44:11,720 --> 02:44:13,040
A lot of people don't know me.

4069
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:14,860
They can't see ghosts.

4070
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:16,300
They don't have a sixth sense.

4071
02:44:18,860 --> 02:44:20,060
I'm manifesting it.

4072
02:44:20,080 --> 02:44:20,620
I'm manifesting it.

4073
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:21,120
I'm manifesting it.

4074
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:31,080
Everybody will now be wondering who gets the elusive Frogbert signed postcard.

4075
02:44:36,310 --> 02:44:38,630
Every Momo knows you're her stinky wife.

4076
02:44:48,710 --> 02:44:50,750
That is a bro moment.

4077
02:44:54,670 --> 02:44:55,510
10 minutes.

4078
02:45:04,380 --> 02:45:06,720
I think I can get through this little stack.

4079
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:11,000
I'm about halfway through the whole stack as a whole.

4080
02:45:11,980 --> 02:45:14,320
Which is, each stack is 250.

4081
02:45:19,660 --> 02:45:20,220
Yeah.

4082
02:45:21,360 --> 02:45:23,400
I wish you blessed gotcha luck, ghost lady.

4083
02:45:24,120 --> 02:45:25,040
Thank you.

4084
02:45:25,460 --> 02:45:26,620
Thank you.

4085
02:45:26,620 --> 02:45:27,660
Thank you.

4086
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:28,560
Thank you.

4087
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:29,240
Thank you.

4088
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:33,760
Oh, I forgot to change the summer special.

4089
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:36,720
This week.

4090
02:45:37,780 --> 02:45:38,720
Or today.

4091
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:41,280
Today was the new episode.

4092
02:45:41,360 --> 02:45:43,060
I wasn't in it because...

4093
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:51,800
We wouldn't have had time to record together since she went to LA and I got stuck in LA.

4094
02:45:54,240 --> 02:45:54,840
So...

4095
02:45:55,640 --> 02:45:56,700
You hate her?

4096
02:45:57,060 --> 02:45:57,660
Yeah.

4097
02:45:58,040 --> 02:46:00,260
10 minutes for the server to crash.

4098
02:46:00,440 --> 02:46:01,280
Don't say that.

4099
02:46:02,180 --> 02:46:02,720
Oh...

4100
02:46:05,740 --> 02:46:08,080
Escape from LA and all.

4101
02:46:11,500 --> 02:46:13,060
But I did eventually escape.

4102
02:46:20,340 --> 02:46:22,620
Did you escape from LA like your hero snake?

4103
02:46:23,460 --> 02:46:24,000
Actually...

4104
02:46:24,770 --> 02:46:26,860
I should have made more escape from LA jokes.

4105
02:46:27,060 --> 02:46:27,400
But...

4106
02:46:27,400 --> 02:46:29,180
I also haven't seen escape from LA.

4107
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:30,900
I've seen escape from New York.

4108
02:46:32,540 --> 02:46:35,360
Maybe we should do a double feature watch along.

4109
02:46:36,220 --> 02:46:37,020
Number stream.

4110
02:46:37,180 --> 02:46:38,080
Double feature...

4111
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:40,660
Escape from New York.

4112
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:42,500
Escape from LA.

4113
02:46:45,160 --> 02:46:46,500
Or I could do it on the Patreon.

4114
02:46:47,960 --> 02:46:49,560
I have to do a Patreon stream.

4115
02:46:59,270 --> 02:47:01,590
My roommate showed me escape from New York a few years back.

4116
02:47:01,790 --> 02:47:02,890
He doesn't even like MGS.

4117
02:47:03,050 --> 02:47:03,930
I mean it's a good movie.

4118
02:47:04,810 --> 02:47:06,630
You don't have to like Metal Gear to like it.

4119
02:47:07,050 --> 02:47:07,630
I think.

4120
02:47:08,910 --> 02:47:10,650
Though my favorite...

4121
02:47:10,650 --> 02:47:14,010
I mean I do like it.

4122
02:47:14,190 --> 02:47:14,590
But I...

4123
02:47:14,590 --> 02:47:16,430
Was it David...

4124
02:47:16,430 --> 02:47:16,800
David...

4125
02:47:17,150 --> 02:47:17,730
David Carpenter?

4126
02:47:17,990 --> 02:47:20,250
I like the thing so much more.

4127
02:47:21,270 --> 02:47:21,810
Yeah.

4128
02:47:21,830 --> 02:47:22,470
Kurt Russell.

4129
02:47:23,090 --> 02:47:24,950
He's so awesome.

4130
02:47:26,410 --> 02:47:28,290
Such a cool actor.

4131
02:47:33,250 --> 02:47:34,530
John Carpenter?

4132
02:47:34,750 --> 02:47:35,610
What did I say?

4133
02:47:36,870 --> 02:47:37,610
I think it was John Carpenter.

4134
02:47:37,610 --> 02:47:38,310
Did I say David?

4135
02:47:38,850 --> 02:47:39,450
Sorry.

4136
02:47:42,910 --> 02:47:47,990
I said David.

4137
02:47:48,190 --> 02:47:49,370
Who the hell is David?

4138
02:47:51,810 --> 02:47:53,250
Welcome to membership.

4139
02:47:53,410 --> 02:47:53,890
Thank you.

4140
02:48:00,570 --> 02:48:01,170
Sorry.

4141
02:48:01,170 --> 02:48:02,870
I just got Snake on the brain.

4142
02:48:03,770 --> 02:48:05,410
John David Carpenter.

4143
02:48:12,740 --> 02:48:14,780
The effect and the thing are just amazing.

4144
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:15,460
I know!

4145
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:20,940
And like the atmosphere and everything.

4146
02:48:22,560 --> 02:48:23,340
Love it.

4147
02:48:23,340 --> 02:48:23,760
I love it.

4148
02:48:23,980 --> 02:48:26,280
David Carpenter and John Hader.

4149
02:48:26,600 --> 02:48:27,440
Oh god!

4150
02:48:27,620 --> 02:48:29,260
What is this alternative universe?

4151
02:48:30,100 --> 02:48:31,560
I'm getting Mandela effect.

4152
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:35,260
What if that was really... I was like, no guys, it's David Hader.

4153
02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:37,400
And John Carpenter.

4154
02:48:37,580 --> 02:48:38,080
And you're like, what?

4155
02:48:38,200 --> 02:48:39,820
No, it's always been John Carpenter.

4156
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:43,600
Wait, I mean David Carpenter and John Hader.

4157
02:48:43,820 --> 02:48:45,380
What are you talking about, Mint?

4158
02:48:45,700 --> 02:48:46,960
You're going crazy.

4159
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:48,620
You're taking your crazy pills.

4160
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:49,700
And I'm like, no!

4161
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:51,340
Mandela effect!

4162
02:48:54,500 --> 02:48:55,060
Sometimes...

4163
02:48:57,280 --> 02:48:59,800
Sometimes Mandela effect feels too real though.

4164
02:49:00,240 --> 02:49:02,640
Like the Bear and Stain Bears.

4165
02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:04,360
Bear and Stain Bears.

4166
02:49:05,700 --> 02:49:07,640
And also like the one that's like...

4167
02:49:07,640 --> 02:49:09,060
The Fruit of the Loom.

4168
02:49:09,080 --> 02:49:10,820
I could have sworn there was a cornucopia.

4169
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:11,800
But there never was.

4170
02:49:12,220 --> 02:49:14,880
Why does everybody remember the cornucopia then?

4171
02:49:15,260 --> 02:49:16,860
The Fruit of the Loom gets me so bad.

4172
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:17,300
I know!

4173
02:49:20,360 --> 02:49:23,880
And I read those bears like every day when I was a kid.

4174
02:49:25,060 --> 02:49:26,680
I was obsessed with them bears.

4175
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:30,960
Made Mint and Mint Phantom?

4176
02:49:31,700 --> 02:49:32,140
What?

4177
02:49:33,100 --> 02:49:34,420
It's always been Made Mint.

4178
02:49:34,520 --> 02:49:35,260
Never Mint Phantom.

4179
02:49:40,860 --> 02:49:42,000
I'm just like, is it...

4180
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:42,680
Are we crazy?

4181
02:49:43,420 --> 02:49:45,420
I don't think I do remember a cornucopia.

4182
02:49:47,680 --> 02:49:48,960
The cornucopia was a thing.

4183
02:49:48,980 --> 02:49:50,160
It was a knockoff brand.

4184
02:49:51,940 --> 02:49:53,200
Bye Mr. Pancake.

4185
02:49:53,240 --> 02:49:53,800
Thanks for watching.

4186
02:49:59,980 --> 02:50:00,900
Have a good night.

4187
02:50:02,480 --> 02:50:03,600
Thanks for hanging out.

4188
02:50:03,720 --> 02:50:04,400
If you're heading out.

4189
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:06,780
Thank you so much for hanging out.

4190
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:10,080
Why is it Made Mint instead of Mint Made?

4191
02:50:11,140 --> 02:50:11,900
Because I'm...

4192
02:50:13,060 --> 02:50:13,700
I don't know.

4193
02:50:14,220 --> 02:50:15,800
I'm the maid who is named Mint.

4194
02:50:20,790 --> 02:50:23,830
I just really wanted to hammer in the fact that I was a maid.

4195
02:50:24,090 --> 02:50:24,310
I guess.

4196
02:50:30,650 --> 02:50:32,290
Myoshi's maid channel.

4197
02:50:33,130 --> 02:50:35,150
It's so funny because when I get...

4198
02:50:36,250 --> 02:50:39,450
When I get spam emails to my email.

4199
02:50:40,090 --> 02:50:41,430
They'll say like...

4200
02:50:43,170 --> 02:50:46,710
Like there's a ridiculous amount of people that call me Made Mint.

4201
02:50:46,710 --> 02:50:48,050
Rather than like Mint Phantom.

4202
02:50:48,930 --> 02:50:49,810
But my...

4203
02:50:49,810 --> 02:50:51,150
But the spam like...

4204
02:50:51,150 --> 02:50:53,370
It'll be like a spam sponsorship or something.

4205
02:50:53,530 --> 02:50:55,570
And you know they're very obviously like spam.

4206
02:50:55,710 --> 02:50:56,290
It'll be like...

4207
02:50:56,290 --> 02:51:00,010
We want to sponsor you for Prada products.

4208
02:51:00,370 --> 02:51:03,530
Will you advertise Prada on your...

4209
02:51:03,530 --> 02:51:04,310
Things like that.

4210
02:51:04,430 --> 02:51:04,890
I'm like...

4211
02:51:04,890 --> 02:51:05,110
Okay.

4212
02:51:05,190 --> 02:51:05,910
This is...

4213
02:51:05,910 --> 02:51:06,150
You know.

4214
02:51:08,790 --> 02:51:09,310
But...

4215
02:51:09,310 --> 02:51:10,210
Oh gosh.

4216
02:51:10,270 --> 02:51:11,590
My signature is getting really sloppy.

4217
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:12,250
I'm so sorry.

4218
02:51:14,150 --> 02:51:15,090
But they always...

4219
02:51:15,090 --> 02:51:16,690
I know most of the time when they're like...

4220
02:51:16,690 --> 02:51:17,550
They're spam.

4221
02:51:17,750 --> 02:51:18,930
When they put like my full...

4222
02:51:19,810 --> 02:51:20,790
Legal name.

4223
02:51:20,990 --> 02:51:22,530
My full YouTube legal name.

4224
02:51:24,930 --> 02:51:25,970
Prada Phantom.

4225
02:51:27,890 --> 02:51:29,610
Mint and Prada collab win.

4226
02:51:29,810 --> 02:51:30,470
Actually though.

4227
02:51:30,630 --> 02:51:32,390
I got a pretty cool...

4228
02:51:32,390 --> 02:51:33,910
Email the other day.

4229
02:51:35,870 --> 02:51:36,970
Of like a...

4230
02:51:36,970 --> 02:51:37,830
PR package.

4231
02:51:38,290 --> 02:51:39,810
That somebody wanted to send.

4232
02:51:39,970 --> 02:51:40,690
That I'm extremely...

4233
02:51:41,930 --> 02:51:42,370
Yeah.

4234
02:51:42,430 --> 02:51:45,370
It's literally Space Ghost's dear Made Mint channel.

4235
02:51:45,370 --> 02:51:46,430
Minto Phantom.

4236
02:51:47,490 --> 02:51:49,110
Like they do that every time.

4237
02:51:49,350 --> 02:51:50,030
It's so funny.

4238
02:51:52,990 --> 02:51:53,730
I got...

4239
02:51:53,730 --> 02:51:54,310
I got...

4240
02:51:54,310 --> 02:51:55,290
I don't know if it's...

4241
02:51:55,290 --> 02:51:56,150
I hope it's legit.

4242
02:51:59,090 --> 02:51:59,730
I'm like...

4243
02:51:59,730 --> 02:52:00,630
I don't know if it was legit.

4244
02:52:00,770 --> 02:52:01,450
I hope it's legit.

4245
02:52:01,550 --> 02:52:02,290
I gave them my address.

4246
02:52:09,100 --> 02:52:09,540
But...

4247
02:52:10,180 --> 02:52:10,620
Okay.

4248
02:52:10,700 --> 02:52:11,600
I just grabbed the other stack.

4249
02:52:12,360 --> 02:52:13,100
Five minutes.

4250
02:52:13,300 --> 02:52:13,720
Yippee.

4251
02:52:17,840 --> 02:52:18,280
I...

4252
02:52:18,280 --> 02:52:18,500
I...

4253
02:52:18,500 --> 02:52:19,080
I verify.

4254
02:52:19,420 --> 02:52:20,680
Or rather I tried to verify it.

4255
02:52:20,700 --> 02:52:21,200
I was like where...

4256
02:52:21,200 --> 02:52:21,480
What...

4257
02:52:21,480 --> 02:52:22,440
What's their LinkedIn?

4258
02:52:22,740 --> 02:52:23,740
And I looked at the website.

4259
02:52:25,220 --> 02:52:26,440
But some of them...

4260
02:52:26,440 --> 02:52:27,860
Some can be pretty tricky.

4261
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:29,880
Like some of the spam ones.

4262
02:52:30,060 --> 02:52:32,060
So that's how like people end up getting like...

4263
02:52:32,700 --> 02:52:33,640
Hacked and stuff.

4264
02:52:36,260 --> 02:52:37,080
And the...

4265
02:52:37,080 --> 02:52:37,580
The...

4266
02:52:37,580 --> 02:52:38,520
The little...

4267
02:52:38,520 --> 02:52:39,600
Hold on.

4268
02:52:39,980 --> 02:52:40,700
This thing?

4269
02:52:42,220 --> 02:52:43,000
Where is it?

4270
02:52:43,720 --> 02:52:44,300
Oh no.

4271
02:52:44,340 --> 02:52:45,140
Did I delete it already?

4272
02:52:46,240 --> 02:52:47,380
The little brick.

4273
02:52:47,620 --> 02:52:48,500
The little brick.

4274
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:49,660
The brick mint.

4275
02:52:49,980 --> 02:52:50,680
That I'll be using.

4276
02:52:50,680 --> 02:52:51,020
That I'll be selling.

4277
02:52:51,220 --> 02:52:51,460
That...

4278
02:52:51,460 --> 02:52:52,640
The one that I announced...

4279
02:52:52,640 --> 02:52:53,040
Um...

4280
02:52:54,020 --> 02:52:55,420
During my anniversary stream.

4281
02:52:56,540 --> 02:52:56,980
Um...

4282
02:52:56,980 --> 02:52:58,780
I almost thought that one was spam too.

4283
02:52:59,860 --> 02:53:00,900
I was just like...

4284
02:53:00,900 --> 02:53:01,040
Huh?

4285
02:53:02,820 --> 02:53:03,680
What is this?

4286
02:53:03,780 --> 02:53:04,220
Oh my gosh.

4287
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:04,840
My signature.

4288
02:53:05,240 --> 02:53:06,160
I'm sorry everybody.

4289
02:53:08,980 --> 02:53:10,440
I almost thought it was spam.

4290
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:11,800
I was like...

4291
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:12,420
This isn't real.

4292
02:53:27,060 --> 02:53:28,300
If it's not English...

4293
02:53:28,300 --> 02:53:28,780
It's spam.

4294
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:29,540
Mint probably.

4295
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:30,080
No.

4296
02:53:30,520 --> 02:53:31,720
How many times does that happen?

4297
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:32,260
Oh my gosh.

4298
02:53:32,300 --> 02:53:33,300
Every day I get...

4299
02:53:33,300 --> 02:53:33,740
Um...

4300
02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:34,940
Spam emails.

4301
02:53:36,840 --> 02:53:39,560
I get more spam emails than I get real offers.

4302
02:53:42,420 --> 02:53:43,140
But that's okay.

4303
02:53:44,900 --> 02:53:45,680
I love you.

4304
02:53:45,720 --> 02:53:46,800
I hope you have a great day.

4305
02:53:46,900 --> 02:53:47,640
I drew an art of you.

4306
02:53:47,700 --> 02:53:48,100
Yippee!

4307
02:53:48,740 --> 02:53:49,140
Cyber!

4308
02:53:49,780 --> 02:53:50,700
Thank you so much!

4309
02:53:51,320 --> 02:53:52,360
Thank you for the super chat.

4310
02:53:52,500 --> 02:53:53,620
And thank you for the art.

4311
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:54,440
Thank you!

4312
02:53:54,900 --> 02:53:55,640
Is that my tag?

4313
02:54:01,240 --> 02:54:02,920
The funniest one I've ever gotten?

4314
02:54:04,060 --> 02:54:04,460
Here.

4315
02:54:04,480 --> 02:54:05,200
I'll go check my email.

4316
02:54:05,220 --> 02:54:05,680
I'll go check my mail right now.

4317
02:54:06,760 --> 02:54:08,440
Let's see what's in there.

4318
02:54:08,760 --> 02:54:10,420
Let's see what's in my email.

4319
02:54:10,640 --> 02:54:11,700
Private email.

4320
02:54:13,320 --> 02:54:14,540
Private email.

4321
02:54:17,600 --> 02:54:18,760
Private email.

4322
02:54:19,440 --> 02:54:20,140
Private email.

4323
02:54:22,440 --> 02:54:23,080
Whoa!

4324
02:54:23,360 --> 02:54:24,320
My god.

4325
02:54:24,520 --> 02:54:25,020
Sorry!

4326
02:54:27,400 --> 02:54:29,280
Matarakan is spamming my inbox.

4327
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:32,320
I have...

4328
02:54:32,320 --> 02:54:32,580
One.

4329
02:54:32,580 --> 02:54:32,860
Two.

4330
02:54:32,940 --> 02:54:33,260
Three.

4331
02:54:33,360 --> 02:54:33,680
Four.

4332
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:34,100
Five.

4333
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:34,540
Six.

4334
02:54:34,640 --> 02:54:34,980
Seven.

4335
02:54:35,020 --> 02:54:35,200
Eight.

4336
02:54:35,220 --> 02:54:37,500
8 emails from Matara-Kan.

4337
02:54:43,420 --> 02:54:48,080
It's for stuff like... It's for a talkathon to add it to my calendar.

4338
02:54:48,220 --> 02:54:49,040
But it's so funny.

4339
02:54:51,440 --> 02:54:52,100
Let's see.

4340
02:54:57,800 --> 02:54:59,280
Oh, I need to respond to that.

4341
02:55:15,270 --> 02:55:16,290
I don't know.

4342
02:55:16,370 --> 02:55:18,570
I don't know what the funniest one I've ever gotten is.

4343
02:55:19,930 --> 02:55:20,450
Hmm...

4344
02:55:22,910 --> 02:55:23,430
Hmm...

4345
02:55:24,610 --> 02:55:25,130
Hmm...

4346
02:55:27,590 --> 02:55:28,110
Hmm...

4347
02:55:39,900 --> 02:55:40,660
I don't know.

4348
02:55:42,540 --> 02:55:43,060
Crypto?

4349
02:55:43,060 --> 02:55:46,340
Oh, I get sometimes like AI collabs.

4350
02:55:46,440 --> 02:55:49,340
They'll be like, do you want to promote our AI app?

4351
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:51,200
And I'm like, no!

4352
02:55:52,880 --> 02:55:53,820
Leave me alone!

4353
02:55:55,380 --> 02:55:58,260
I want to promote your stinky AI app.

4354
02:56:01,620 --> 02:56:02,180
Hehehehe.

4355
02:56:08,350 --> 02:56:08,910
Stinky...

4356
02:56:11,070 --> 02:56:11,630
Yeah.

4357
02:56:16,200 --> 02:56:19,080
I want Mint to be my GPS assistant voice.

4358
02:56:21,300 --> 02:56:22,640
Oh my gosh, did you see it?

4359
02:56:22,700 --> 02:56:24,500
Someone like, put out a uh...

4360
02:56:25,300 --> 02:56:25,860
A...

4361
02:56:26,780 --> 02:56:28,280
Miku voice for Waze.

4362
02:56:28,600 --> 02:56:29,420
That's crazy.

4363
02:56:30,300 --> 02:56:32,520
Maybe it will make me start using Waze.

4364
02:56:32,800 --> 02:56:34,280
My mom once used Waze.

4365
02:56:34,280 --> 02:56:34,380
Waze.

4366
02:56:34,480 --> 02:56:38,520
It was the first time I had ever seen someone use it when I was driving with her.

4367
02:56:38,900 --> 02:56:40,600
And it was so annoying.

4368
02:56:40,920 --> 02:56:45,140
I wanted to tear out the middle console.

4369
02:56:45,280 --> 02:56:46,460
I was like, shut up!

4370
02:56:47,100 --> 02:56:49,660
Waze is so... oh my gosh, I hate it.

4371
02:56:49,720 --> 02:56:52,880
It'll be like, you missed that turn, but that's okay.

4372
02:56:53,160 --> 02:56:54,220
And I'm like, shut up!

4373
02:56:54,280 --> 02:56:55,220
What are you talking about?

4374
02:56:56,560 --> 02:56:58,160
Oh my gosh, they're so annoying.

4375
02:56:58,340 --> 02:57:02,820
It's like this stupid toxic positivity thing that just drives me crazy.

4376
02:57:08,320 --> 02:57:09,480
It's so annoying.

4377
02:57:12,480 --> 02:57:14,620
It sounds a bit passive-aggressive.

4378
02:57:14,680 --> 02:57:17,460
It didn't seem condescending.

4379
02:57:17,700 --> 02:57:24,280
I can't remember it now because it was a long time ago that I heard it.

4380
02:57:24,580 --> 02:57:30,160
But it was just like, some things would be like, hey, I was just letting you know that you're going to want to turn.

4381
02:57:30,320 --> 02:57:33,300
And like, five miles.

4382
02:57:33,620 --> 02:57:34,120
I don't know.

4383
02:57:34,280 --> 02:57:35,600
I'm like, shut up!

4384
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:36,080
What do you mean?

4385
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:38,220
Wrong way, baka!

4386
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:41,340
Would you prefer regular toxicity?

4387
02:57:41,540 --> 02:57:42,540
No, just give it to me straight.

4388
02:57:44,020 --> 02:57:45,180
Just give it to me straight.

4389
02:57:45,380 --> 02:57:48,660
Turn in two minutes.

4390
02:57:48,880 --> 02:57:50,220
Or 500 feet.

4391
02:57:50,380 --> 02:57:50,700
Or whatever.

4392
02:57:50,840 --> 02:57:51,240
Not minutes.

4393
02:57:52,280 --> 02:57:54,080
What if it was Snake's voice or Otacon?

4394
02:57:55,540 --> 02:57:56,760
Well, that's just unfair.

4395
02:57:57,020 --> 02:57:58,160
Of course I wouldn't...

4396
02:57:59,160 --> 02:57:59,900
Of course!

4397
02:58:01,660 --> 02:58:02,620
Negative toxicity.

4398
02:58:02,840 --> 02:58:03,920
GPS it is.

4399
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:09,280
Be like, where the hell are you going, dummy?

4400
02:58:11,380 --> 02:58:13,820
What the hell are you doing, idiot?

4401
02:58:15,040 --> 02:58:17,280
You made the wrong turn!

4402
02:58:29,170 --> 02:58:31,030
Who taught you to drive?

4403
02:58:31,170 --> 02:58:31,610
Yeah.

4404
02:58:35,160 --> 02:58:37,640
What if there was like...

4405
02:58:38,520 --> 02:58:42,120
Actually, I was going to say, what if there was a GPS app that like, you...

4406
02:58:43,380 --> 02:58:46,540
It just told you directions, but you didn't know where you were going.

4407
02:58:46,600 --> 02:58:48,020
And you just went to a random place.

4408
02:58:48,660 --> 02:58:51,960
But I was thinking, that's kind of like the Randonautica, right?

4409
02:58:53,800 --> 02:58:54,980
Did you guys ever do that?

4410
02:58:55,080 --> 02:58:57,240
It was like geocaching, but not really.

4411
02:58:59,660 --> 02:59:00,780
Randonautica, but just...

4412
02:59:02,100 --> 02:59:02,840
Mintway's voice pack.

4413
02:59:02,980 --> 02:59:03,340
Turn now.

4414
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:04,180
Haha, just kidding.

4415
02:59:04,380 --> 02:59:04,800
Made the turn.

4416
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:05,420
Teehee, pedo.

4417
02:59:08,200 --> 02:59:08,520
Dressina!

4418
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:10,120
Oh my gosh.

4419
02:59:10,160 --> 02:59:10,420
Oh my gosh.

4420
02:59:10,420 --> 02:59:10,680
Oh my gosh.

4421
02:59:10,700 --> 02:59:10,960
Oh my gosh.

4422
02:59:14,280 --> 02:59:16,020
Oh my gosh.

4423
02:59:16,120 --> 02:59:16,360
Oh my gosh.

4424
02:59:16,400 --> 02:59:16,620
Oh my gosh.

4425
02:59:16,680 --> 02:59:17,480
Oh my gosh.

4426
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:18,080
Oh my gosh.

4427
02:59:18,080 --> 02:59:18,380
Oh my gosh.

4428
02:59:18,380 --> 02:59:18,760
She's live?

4429
02:59:19,960 --> 02:59:20,820
Oh, wait.

4430
02:59:23,400 --> 02:59:23,960
Wait.

4431
02:59:23,960 --> 02:59:24,520
Wait.

4432
02:59:25,300 --> 02:59:25,860
Fast!

4433
02:59:26,720 --> 02:59:27,000
Wait.

4434
02:59:27,880 --> 02:59:28,440
Wait.

4435
02:59:28,660 --> 02:59:29,520
Oh my god.

4436
02:59:29,700 --> 02:59:34,000
Oh my gosh, also summer.

4437
02:59:34,540 --> 02:59:35,500
Swimsuit Hoshino.

4438
02:59:38,800 --> 02:59:40,780
Wait, but Swimsuit Hoshino is so cute!

4439
02:59:41,800 --> 02:59:42,640
Okay, here I go.

4440
02:59:42,700 --> 02:59:44,720
I have one free tent pole recruit.

4441
02:59:47,120 --> 02:59:48,700
Okay, here, I'm gonna turn... here.

4442
02:59:48,940 --> 02:59:50,440
I'm gonna turn off the music and see it.

4443
02:59:53,700 --> 02:59:54,460
Can you hear that?

4444
02:59:57,460 --> 02:59:58,460
Can you hear that?

4445
02:59:58,560 --> 02:59:58,840
Okay.

4446
03:00:00,440 --> 03:00:03,160
Oh, I also have some free one recruit tickets too.

4447
03:00:03,720 --> 03:00:04,560
Okay, we can hear?

4448
03:00:04,780 --> 03:00:05,140
Okay.

4449
03:00:05,900 --> 03:00:07,020
Okay, here I go.

4450
03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:09,280
I'm using my free tent pole.

4451
03:00:18,290 --> 03:00:19,770
I'm drawing a sad face.

4452
03:00:31,060 --> 03:00:32,260
Okay, skip.

4453
03:00:35,280 --> 03:00:38,840
Okay, I'm gonna use all my free tickets.

4454
03:00:39,140 --> 03:00:40,880
So this is an individual one.

4455
03:00:41,040 --> 03:00:41,400
Awesome.

4456
03:00:41,400 --> 03:00:41,760
Listen up.

4457
03:00:42,380 --> 03:00:43,460
You nerd.

4458
03:00:45,440 --> 03:00:46,500
What did I get?

4459
03:00:46,620 --> 03:00:46,660
Oh.

4460
03:00:46,700 --> 03:00:47,080
Oops.

4461
03:00:48,380 --> 03:00:49,640
Oh, it's yellow.

4462
03:00:50,460 --> 03:00:51,140
Wow.

4463
03:00:53,080 --> 03:00:53,420
Heidi.

4464
03:00:54,120 --> 03:00:54,800
Heidi.

4465
03:00:57,120 --> 03:00:57,800
Okay.

4466
03:00:58,100 --> 03:00:59,020
Recruit one.

4467
03:01:01,300 --> 03:01:01,980
Pink!

4468
03:01:03,100 --> 03:01:03,600
Blue.

4469
03:01:08,980 --> 03:01:11,160
I love drawing the faces.

4470
03:01:11,160 --> 03:01:12,620
We need pink.

4471
03:01:16,300 --> 03:01:16,980
Kotori.

4472
03:01:18,680 --> 03:01:19,580
Recruit again.

4473
03:01:22,660 --> 03:01:23,780
Come on, Arona.

4474
03:01:23,800 --> 03:01:24,000
Pink!

4475
03:01:25,020 --> 03:01:25,560
Blue.

4476
03:01:29,200 --> 03:01:29,880
Okay.

4477
03:01:33,450 --> 03:01:35,730
These are just singles, by the way, so...

4478
03:01:36,710 --> 03:01:37,050
Kotama.

4479
03:01:37,050 --> 03:01:37,470
Kotama...

4480
03:01:40,510 --> 03:01:43,090
Okay, this is my last single free pole.

4481

Oh, sorry.

Oops.

Hanai...

4485
03:01:57,840 --> 03:01:58,360
Okay.

Haha.

That's okay.

4508
03:03:06,590 --> 03:03:07,310
That's okay.

4509
03:03:09,890 --> 03:03:10,890
Oh, second one!

4510
03:03:12,430 --> 03:03:13,930
No, it's not her though.

4511
03:03:15,890 --> 03:03:16,450
Wow!

4512
03:03:16,810 --> 03:03:19,450

Fourth 10 pull?

4523
03:04:03,660 --> 03:04:06,360
I've been wanting Wakamo for a while though, so that's good.

Oh, here we go.

4531

Why can't we see the screen?

4532
03:04:58,640 --> 03:04:59,500
Because it's on my phone.

4533
03:04:59,560 --> 03:05:00,060
I'm sorry.

4534
03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:04,800

got Rumi.

4554
03:06:02,030 --> 03:06:04,090
At least it was somebody new.

4555
03:06:10,390 --> 03:06:13,490
Out of three, only one of them was new.

4556
03:06:13,610 --> 03:06:14,510
That's so rude.

4557
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:20,580
There were three of them!

4558
03:06:20,920 --> 03:06:22,600

4577
03:07:07,830 --> 03:07:08,930
Hina, come home, please!

4578
03:07:13,020 --> 03:07:15,640
So I can also pull for swimsuit.

03:08:12,500 --> 03:08:12,500
Pink!

4678
03:08:12,500 --> 03:08:12,500
Pink!

4679
03:08:12,500 --> 03:08:12,500
Pink!

4680
03:08:12,500 --> 03:08:12,520
Pink!

4681
03:08:12,520 --> 03:08:12,520
Pink!

4682
03:08:12,520 --> 03:08:12,520
Pink!

4683
03:08:12,520 --> 03:08:12,520
Pink!

4684
03:08:12,520 --> 03:08:12,520
Pink!

4685
03:08:12,520 --> 03:08:12,520
Pink!

4686
03:08:12,520 --> 03:08:12,540
Pink!

4687
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:12,540
Pink!

4688
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:12,540
Pink!

4689
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:12,540
Pink!

4690
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:12,540
Pink!

4691
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:12,540
Pink!

4692
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:12,600
Pink!

4693
03:08:12,600 --> 03:08:12,600
Pink!

4694
03:08:12,600 --> 03:08:12,600
Pink!

4695
03:08:12,600 --> 03:08:12,600
Pink!

4696
03:08:23,990 --> 03:08:24,670
Pink!

4697
03:08:27,310 --> 03:08:27,990
Pink!

4698
03:08:27,990 --> 03:08:27,990
Pink

4699
03:08:36,100 --> 03:08:38,160
What is this luck, man?

4700
03:08:38,420 --> 03:08:40,700
I've gotten, what, three new?

4701
03:08:40,880 --> 03:08:43,960
How many, how many, ten, how many, how many...

4702
03:08:44,600 --> 03:08:48,360
I'm at 94 ten pulls, but how many new characters have I got?

4703
03:08:48,420 --> 03:08:50,300
How many three stars have I had?

4704
03:08:50,400 --> 03:08:51,040
This is insane!

4705
03:08:52,960 --> 03:08:54,060
Oh my gosh.

4706
03:08:55,240 --> 03:08:55,760
Okay.

4707
03:08:56,400 --> 03:08:58,280
I'm at 13,000 still.

4708
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,260
I can do a little bit more.

4709
03:09:02,900 --> 03:09:04,220
Why, Hina, why?

4710
03:09:06,140 --> 03:09:06,740
Yeah,

4711
03:09:11,760 --> 03:09:12,440
94 pulls.

4712
03:09:12,660 --> 03:09:14,160
It flipped!

4713
03:09:14,460 --> 03:09:15,280
And I got two!

4714
03:09:15,560 --> 03:09:16,340
What is happening?

4715
03:09:16,740 --> 03:09:17,640
That's, oh my god.

4716
03:09:17,820 --> 03:09:19,360
Oh, please, Hina!

4717
03:09:23,960 --> 03:09:25,160
First one?

4718
03:09:25,580 --> 03:09:26,180
Wait.

4719
03:09:26,540 --> 03:09:27,560
Who is this?

4720
03:09:29,780 --> 03:09:35,080
Oh, I got, um, tracksuit Haruna.

4721
03:09:36,780 --> 03:09:38,840
I didn't have her before, so that's nice.

4722
03:09:39,200 --> 03:09:40,400
Please, please!

4723
03:09:44,380 --> 03:09:45,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4724
03:09:47,420 --> 03:09:48,820
Okay, one more, one more!

4725
03:09:50,100 --> 03:09:50,580
Yes!

4726
03:10:07,210 --> 03:10:07,690
Yes!

4727
03:10:11,690 --> 03:10:12,830
On the floor!

4728
03:10:12,830 --> 03:10:13,350
I flipped one!

4729
03:10:13,570 --> 03:10:15,110
Oh my gosh, it showed up as blue!

4730
03:10:15,730 --> 03:10:19,330
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

4731
03:10:19,610 --> 03:10:20,850
Nice, nice, nice, nice!

4732
03:10:22,830 --> 03:10:26,790
I might be able to spark for, uh, for...

4733
03:10:27,770 --> 03:10:29,070
Oh, she's not at this rate.

4734
03:10:35,800 --> 03:10:36,280
Yubi!

4735
03:10:38,520 --> 03:10:39,460
We did it!

4736
03:10:43,620 --> 03:10:44,100
Yubi!

4737
03:10:46,300 --> 03:10:47,700
Oh, Hina secured!

4738
03:10:50,380 --> 03:10:50,860
Spark?

4739
03:10:51,200 --> 03:10:53,800
No, I have a... I still have to have 100 more pulls.

4740
03:10:54,500 --> 03:10:57,020
I don't know, should I... I still have 12,000.

4741
03:10:59,040 --> 03:11:01,960
I still have 12,000, but maybe I should save it.

4742
03:11:03,600 --> 03:11:05,880
Hoshino's swimsuit is really cute, though.

4743
03:11:06,480 --> 03:11:08,880
Okay, I'm gonna try it once for Hoshino.

4744
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:10,300
I'm gonna try it once.

4745
03:11:15,140 --> 03:11:15,720
Blue!

4746
03:11:20,650 --> 03:11:21,230
Blue!

4747
03:11:23,670 --> 03:11:26,810
Wow, I got four... four...

4748
03:11:28,030 --> 03:11:29,230
Two stars, though.

4749
03:11:30,910 --> 03:11:32,350
Maybe... okay, one more!

4750
03:11:34,010 --> 03:11:34,790
One more.

4751
03:11:35,890 --> 03:11:36,650
One more.

4752
03:11:36,790 --> 03:11:37,570
Okay, this is it.

4753
03:11:38,850 --> 03:11:39,630
For real.

4754
03:11:41,010 --> 03:11:41,590
Blue!

4755
03:11:46,200 --> 03:11:47,680
Ugh, okay, nevermind.

4756
03:11:48,580 --> 03:11:49,420
Blue archive.

4757
03:11:49,820 --> 03:11:50,160
Yes!

4758
03:11:50,520 --> 03:11:50,860
That's right.

4759
03:11:53,380 --> 03:11:55,820
The banner is 6% right now, worth sparking.

4760
03:12:04,470 --> 03:12:05,310
I mean...

4761
03:12:11,430 --> 03:12:12,610
Congrats on getting just Hina.

4762
03:12:12,730 --> 03:12:14,150
Thanks for sharing your luck.

4763
03:12:14,190 --> 03:12:15,410
Managed to get her in 80 pulls.

4764
03:12:15,510 --> 03:12:15,810
Yippee.

4765
03:12:15,850 --> 03:12:17,190
Wow, thanks for bragging.

4766
03:12:18,510 --> 03:12:20,890
Yeah, but I don't want to spend all my gems, you guys.

4767
03:12:24,810 --> 03:12:26,570
Did you need anything else from this banner?

4768
03:12:26,570 --> 03:12:28,210
I've gotten so many new girls.

4769
03:12:28,290 --> 03:12:28,530
Let's see.

4770
03:12:28,590 --> 03:12:30,010
Let me count how many new girls I've gotten.

4771
03:12:32,730 --> 03:12:33,130
Uh...

4772
03:12:33,130 --> 03:12:35,070
How many new girls did I get?

4773
03:12:35,190 --> 03:12:35,530
Let's see.

4774
03:12:37,590 --> 03:12:37,990
Um...

4775
03:12:37,990 --> 03:12:38,550
Uh...

4776
03:12:38,550 --> 03:12:39,910
Oh, uh...

4777
03:12:39,910 --> 03:12:40,590
Where is it?

4778
03:12:40,650 --> 03:12:41,910
I got one, Wakamo.

4779
03:12:43,110 --> 03:12:43,750
Meru, two.

4780
03:12:44,310 --> 03:12:45,030
Haruna, three.

4781
03:12:45,230 --> 03:12:45,990
Dress Hina, four.

4782
03:12:46,670 --> 03:12:47,430
Rumi, five.

4783
03:12:50,290 --> 03:12:51,770
Five girl... five new girls.

4784
03:12:52,090 --> 03:12:53,170
And then... oh, okay.

4785
03:12:53,250 --> 03:12:53,590
Oh, no.

4786
03:12:53,750 --> 03:12:55,110
Iroha was from the previous banner.

4787
03:12:55,110 --> 03:12:57,150
But five new girls is really good.

4788
03:13:00,010 --> 03:13:02,910
Got Hina and Hoshino after 280 pulls.

4789
03:13:04,710 --> 03:13:06,290
Save for Shiroko Terror.

4790
03:13:09,430 --> 03:13:13,310
There's no good units until next Fest, so you have six months.

4791
03:13:13,870 --> 03:13:15,130
I guess that's true.

4792
03:13:15,930 --> 03:13:18,390
But wait, isn't Mika coming back soon though?

4793
03:13:20,110 --> 03:13:21,270
I don't have Mika.

4794
03:13:25,940 --> 03:13:27,700
I thought Mika was coming back soon.

4795
03:13:28,440 --> 03:13:29,480
Oh, she's next Fest.

4796
03:13:29,620 --> 03:13:30,100
Oh, okay.

4797
03:13:30,620 --> 03:13:31,660
Alright, let's pull, baby.

4798
03:13:34,360 --> 03:13:35,320
Let's keep pulling.

4799
03:13:39,120 --> 03:13:39,560
Hoshino!

4800
03:13:43,080 --> 03:13:43,520
Blue.

4801
03:13:44,220 --> 03:13:45,480
You can borrow my Mika.

4802
03:13:46,160 --> 03:13:47,340
I already do, Oimo.

4803
03:13:48,500 --> 03:13:49,880
Actually, I don't think you have her.

4804
03:13:50,240 --> 03:13:51,380
As her... as your...

4805
03:13:52,200 --> 03:13:53,060
As your character.

4806
03:13:59,860 --> 03:14:00,660
You do?

4807
03:14:01,340 --> 03:14:01,940
Oh.

4808
03:14:05,920 --> 03:14:06,700
One more!

4809
03:14:06,860 --> 03:14:07,480
Next one!

4810
03:14:08,720 --> 03:14:09,260
Blue!

4811
03:14:11,480 --> 03:14:13,720
I got used to seeing pink so often.

4812
03:14:21,960 --> 03:14:22,560
Skip.

4813
03:14:22,840 --> 03:14:23,880
Skip, skip, skip.

4814
03:14:27,100 --> 03:14:28,560
I'm at 7600.

4815
03:14:29,860 --> 03:14:30,820
Alright, next!

4816
03:14:35,900 --> 03:14:36,500
Blue.

4817
03:14:36,520 --> 03:14:36,700
Blue.

4818
03:14:38,260 --> 03:14:38,780
Blue.

4819
03:14:39,380 --> 03:14:39,820
Blue.

4820
03:14:41,580 --> 03:14:42,100
Blue.

4821
03:14:42,100 --> 03:14:42,860
I'm drawing a picture.

4822
03:14:44,040 --> 03:14:44,560
Ehhh.

4823
03:14:46,620 --> 03:14:47,560
Full blue.

4824
03:14:50,560 --> 03:14:54,980
Oh my God, all three of my two stars are...

4825
03:14:54,980 --> 03:14:56,440
Oh gosh, what's her name?

4826
03:14:56,560 --> 03:14:57,700
I can't remember her name.

4827
03:14:57,820 --> 03:14:58,360
I don't use her.

4828
03:14:58,560 --> 03:14:59,080
The...

4829
03:14:59,880 --> 03:15:01,440
The red-haired devil girl.

4830
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:03,800
What's her name?

4831
03:15:04,180 --> 03:15:04,700
Junko!

4832
03:15:04,800 --> 03:15:05,140
Yeah.

4833
03:15:07,680 --> 03:15:08,120
Next!

4834
03:15:10,340 --> 03:15:12,480
I'm gonna end up using all of them at this rate.

4835
03:15:12,560 --> 03:15:12,940
Pink!

4836
03:15:15,800 --> 03:15:17,920
I'm gonna end up using all of my gems at this point.

4837
03:15:19,740 --> 03:15:20,180
Pink!

4838
03:15:20,500 --> 03:15:20,720
Pink!

4839
03:15:20,800 --> 03:15:20,940
Pink!

4840
03:15:23,120 --> 03:15:24,160
Junko is very cute.

4841
03:15:27,860 --> 03:15:28,300
Serina.

4842
03:15:29,800 --> 03:15:30,240
Shimiko.

4843
03:15:32,480 --> 03:15:33,360
Sensei's daughter.

4844
03:15:35,400 --> 03:15:36,860
It doesn't count as a daughter.

4845
03:15:37,200 --> 03:15:38,600
I'm so used to VTubers.

4846
03:15:41,140 --> 03:15:41,860
Here it is!

4847
03:15:41,900 --> 03:15:42,260
Here it is!

4848
03:15:44,920 --> 03:15:45,400
Sakurako.

4849
03:15:47,120 --> 03:15:47,600
Sakurako.

4850
03:15:51,760 --> 03:15:53,220
Is Dress Hina already out?

4851
03:15:53,300 --> 03:15:53,480
Yeah!

4852
03:15:56,620 --> 03:15:58,420
I'm at 164 pulls.

4853
03:16:08,260 --> 03:16:10,600
Got both Hina and Hoshino within 40 rolls.

4854
03:16:10,620 --> 03:16:12,000
Stop bragging to me!

4855
03:16:13,640 --> 03:16:14,560
Stop bragging!

4856
03:16:15,460 --> 03:16:16,900
This is so messed up!

4857
03:16:19,700 --> 03:16:20,160
Pink!

4858
03:16:23,520 --> 03:16:23,980
Please.

4859
03:16:24,960 --> 03:16:26,560
I've been a good sensei.

4860
03:16:27,140 --> 03:16:28,680
I've been a good sensei.

4861
03:16:28,680 --> 03:16:30,020
I do all my dailies.

4862
03:16:30,180 --> 03:16:30,960
Oh, it's the second one.

4863
03:16:31,060 --> 03:16:31,620
Okay, we can...

4864
03:16:32,180 --> 03:16:33,480
rip off the band-aid.

4865
03:16:35,540 --> 03:16:36,000
Oh!

4866
03:16:37,620 --> 03:16:38,540
Someone new though.

4867
03:16:39,760 --> 03:16:40,220
Oh!

4868
03:16:43,200 --> 03:16:43,660
Oh!

4869
03:16:49,790 --> 03:16:50,970
I got Denge.

4870
03:16:51,670 --> 03:16:52,730
Oh, my bad.

4871
03:16:52,770 --> 03:16:53,330
Sorry, Denge.

4872
03:17:00,160 --> 03:17:01,100
I don't...

4873
03:17:01,760 --> 03:17:02,720
I'm like...

4874
03:17:03,520 --> 03:17:04,580
Sorry, I'm like...

4875
03:17:04,580 --> 03:17:04,780
Who?

4876
03:17:07,920 --> 03:17:10,140
You guys have 4000 left!

4877
03:17:10,840 --> 03:17:11,400
4000!

4878
03:17:12,520 --> 03:17:13,280
Next one!

4879
03:17:15,640 --> 03:17:16,200
Blue!

4880
03:17:19,860 --> 03:17:21,080
I'm scared to pull.

4881
03:17:21,880 --> 03:17:22,840
You should be.

4882
03:17:22,940 --> 03:17:24,140
This is a bloodbath.

4883
03:17:26,120 --> 03:17:27,500
This is a bloodbath.

4884
03:17:31,800 --> 03:17:32,280
Mamai!

4885
03:17:35,720 --> 03:17:36,200
Alright.

4886
03:17:37,060 --> 03:17:38,540
I can do two more pulls.

4887
03:17:39,900 --> 03:17:40,720
This is it.

4888
03:17:42,820 --> 03:17:46,560
Don't brag unless you intend to send her money to keep rolling cowards.

4889
03:17:50,490 --> 03:17:51,170
Oh, yeah.

4890
03:17:51,230 --> 03:17:54,090
It does have a pity system, but only after 200 pulls.

4891
03:17:55,030 --> 03:17:55,470
So...

4892
03:17:56,890 --> 03:17:57,750
Oh, my god.

4893
03:17:57,810 --> 03:18:00,590
I got the nine blue ones.

4894
03:18:04,610 --> 03:18:05,050
Alright.

4895
03:18:06,030 --> 03:18:06,690
Last one.

4896
03:18:07,010 --> 03:18:07,450
Wait!

4897
03:18:07,590 --> 03:18:09,090
I'll be able to spark for her though.

4898
03:18:09,510 --> 03:18:10,390
At this point.

4899
03:18:11,730 --> 03:18:12,650
Here it is.

4900
03:18:15,290 --> 03:18:15,730
Blue.

4901
03:18:20,260 --> 03:18:21,140
And... flip.

4902
03:18:21,400 --> 03:18:22,000
Nope.

4903
03:18:28,400 --> 03:18:30,420
I'm gonna get so many ellips though.

4904
03:18:30,820 --> 03:18:31,200
Yippee!

4905
03:18:33,680 --> 03:18:35,700
I got so many ellips, you guys.

4906
03:18:39,780 --> 03:18:42,280
I can spark for her.

4907
03:18:44,240 --> 03:18:46,680
I have 402 left.

4908
03:18:52,240 --> 03:18:54,060
Secured Hina and Hoshino in 13.

4909
03:18:54,280 --> 03:18:55,400
Thank you for your energy.

4910
03:18:56,640 --> 03:18:56,800
Stop bragging!

4911
03:18:57,040 --> 03:18:59,040
Keep pulling for your own pride.

4912
03:18:59,320 --> 03:18:59,940
Thank you.

4913
03:19:03,720 --> 03:19:04,920
Stop bragging.

4914
03:19:06,520 --> 03:19:07,420
Oh, gosh.

4915
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:08,860
Very confused.

4916
03:19:08,960 --> 03:19:09,320
Sorry.

4917
03:19:09,420 --> 03:19:11,120
I'm pulling in blue archive right now.

4918
03:19:11,340 --> 03:19:12,260
It's a special event.

4919
03:19:13,720 --> 03:19:15,440
How many did I have saved up?

4920
03:19:15,540 --> 03:19:16,240
I had...

4921
03:19:16,240 --> 03:19:17,780
I had...

4922
03:19:20,080 --> 03:19:21,280
20,000.

4923
03:19:22,840 --> 03:19:23,440
Maybe...

4924
03:19:23,440 --> 03:19:24,780
23,000.

4925
03:19:33,350 --> 03:19:33,950
Mima...

4926
03:19:34,790 --> 03:19:35,470
Mima...

4927
03:19:36,650 --> 03:19:37,490
Pulling fun.

4928
03:19:37,610 --> 03:19:38,130
Thank you.

4929
03:19:38,670 --> 03:19:40,090
How many pulls is that?

4930
03:19:40,250 --> 03:19:40,890
About 200.

4931
03:19:44,290 --> 03:19:45,210
200 of them.

4932
03:19:45,350 --> 03:19:48,310
I want Hoshino swimsuit.

4933
03:19:48,950 --> 03:19:50,010
Should I pull?

4934
03:19:50,550 --> 03:19:51,610
Or should I...

4935
03:19:51,610 --> 03:19:52,250
Should I buy?

4936
03:19:53,630 --> 03:19:56,570
I got 150 more because I...

4937
03:19:56,570 --> 03:20:00,550
I pulled so many new students.

4938
03:20:00,790 --> 03:20:03,910
I pulled so many new students.

4939
03:20:03,910 --> 03:20:04,790
Now...

4940
03:20:04,790 --> 03:20:05,970
I pulled 6 new students.

4941
03:20:07,010 --> 03:20:07,870
It's not bad.

4942
03:20:08,830 --> 03:20:09,950
And then I also...

4943
03:20:09,950 --> 03:20:12,230
From the previous banner, I pulled Kasumi and Iroha.

4944
03:20:13,950 --> 03:20:15,090
So, out of...

4945
03:20:15,090 --> 03:20:16,490
In the past week, I got...

4946
03:20:16,490 --> 03:20:19,270
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

4947
03:20:20,030 --> 03:20:20,510
8.

4948
03:20:20,610 --> 03:20:23,090
And then also, I got Dressako.

4949
03:20:23,370 --> 03:20:23,890
So, 9.

4950
03:20:24,250 --> 03:20:25,850
And also, Makoto.

4951
03:20:25,990 --> 03:20:26,390
So, 10.

4952
03:20:26,550 --> 03:20:28,650
In the past week, I got 10 new students.

4953
03:20:37,560 --> 03:20:39,900
But my luck has always been very bad.

4954
03:20:39,940 --> 03:20:41,740
So, I don't have very many 3 stars.

4955
03:20:42,800 --> 03:20:43,620
But my luck has always been very bad.

4956
03:20:43,620 --> 03:20:45,040
So, I don't have very many 3 stars.

4957
03:20:45,360 --> 03:20:47,080
You don't deserve summer Hoshido.

4958
03:20:47,120 --> 03:20:47,940
What are you talking about?

4959
03:20:48,360 --> 03:20:50,160
I'm banning you, Oimo Buster.

4960
03:20:50,260 --> 03:20:50,780
Fuck off.

4961
03:20:51,200 --> 03:20:55,080
Get this bitch out of my chat.

4962
03:20:56,500 --> 03:20:58,520
In time out for 24 hours.

4963
03:20:59,200 --> 03:21:00,060
In time out for 24 hours.

4964
03:21:00,780 --> 03:21:01,300
I

4965
03:21:07,860 --> 03:21:08,680
hear your bullshit.

4966
03:21:09,260 --> 03:21:10,140
Goodbye, Oimo.

4967
03:21:12,020 --> 03:21:13,080
I have...

4968
03:21:13,080 --> 03:21:14,380
You don't even understand.

4969
03:21:14,720 --> 03:21:18,200
I just got the achievement that was like...

4970
03:21:18,200 --> 03:21:19,040
I just got the achievement that was like...

4971
03:21:19,040 --> 03:21:21,260
Have 93 star students.

4972
03:21:21,560 --> 03:21:23,680
My luck in this game is shit.

4973
03:21:23,920 --> 03:21:24,140
My luck in this game is shit.

4974
03:21:24,140 --> 03:21:24,400
Okay?

4975
03:21:26,340 --> 03:21:27,820
You don't deserve her.

4976
03:21:28,020 --> 03:21:29,060
What are you talking about?

4977
03:21:29,260 --> 03:21:30,380
I still don't have Shiroko.

4978
03:21:30,580 --> 03:21:31,720
Regular Shiroko.

4979
03:21:32,400 --> 03:21:33,640
I can claim her.

4980
03:21:33,640 --> 03:21:34,660
I have...

4981
03:21:35,420 --> 03:21:37,720
I have 221 of her Eliphs.

4982
03:21:37,800 --> 03:21:39,880
But I'm just waiting for the day I pull her.

4983
03:21:44,260 --> 03:21:46,100
Are you free to play Mint?

4984
03:21:47,700 --> 03:21:49,440
I do the monthly...

4985
03:21:49,440 --> 03:21:50,560
The monthly package.

4986
03:21:50,860 --> 03:21:52,600
You know where you get the little bit every day.

4987
03:21:52,820 --> 03:21:54,760
And then you also get the extra...

4988
03:21:56,120 --> 03:21:57,080
The extra...

4989
03:21:57,080 --> 03:21:57,520
What's it called?

4990
03:21:59,280 --> 03:22:01,460
Scrimmage tickets and the extra bounty tickets.

4991
03:22:02,700 --> 03:22:03,620
Do you have Kohaku?

4992
03:22:03,640 --> 03:22:05,260
I had to use a ticket on her.

4993
03:22:06,920 --> 03:22:08,620
I had to use a ticket on her.

4994
03:22:09,920 --> 03:22:10,440
I had to use a ticket on her.

4995
03:22:10,440 --> 03:22:11,120
I didn't have her.

4996
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:15,440
Can't believe you killed Oimo.

4997
03:22:16,100 --> 03:22:16,580
Good.

4998
03:22:20,300 --> 03:22:21,880
Sorry I'm in my cafe now.

4999
03:22:30,820 --> 03:22:31,940
What level are you?

5000
03:22:31,980 --> 03:22:34,140
I'm only 75 I think.

5001
03:22:34,640 --> 03:22:35,120
76?

5002
03:22:39,560 --> 03:22:40,300
Oh nice.

5003
03:22:41,400 --> 03:22:41,880
Oh nice.

5004
03:22:50,000 --> 03:22:51,560
You can't back out on stream.

5005
03:22:54,520 --> 03:22:55,780
Hashtag Oimo did nothing wrong.

5006
03:22:55,920 --> 03:22:59,040
Also she showed her BA room yesterday and it was not as bad as you made it out to be.

5007
03:22:59,100 --> 03:23:00,060
You're just an Oimo hater.

5008
03:23:00,140 --> 03:23:01,080
What are you talking about?

5009
03:23:01,140 --> 03:23:02,660
She had to have added more stuff.

5010
03:23:02,940 --> 03:23:03,740
Are you kidding me?

5011
03:23:04,440 --> 03:23:05,880
She added more stuff.

5012
03:23:08,440 --> 03:23:09,360
What are you saying?

5013
03:23:09,520 --> 03:23:11,840
She said that I didn't deserve Summer Hoshino.

5014
03:23:11,880 --> 03:23:13,060
I spent all my gems.

5015
03:23:15,800 --> 03:23:20,200
How much is it for Carrier Boy here?

5016
03:23:20,280 --> 03:23:26,040
Carrier boy here, Oimo said she rolled 3 stars in 200 polls last fest She also said, please forgive me.

5017
03:23:27,800 --> 03:23:29,520
It's because I have so few.

5018
03:23:32,740 --> 03:23:35,080
It's because I have so few stars to...

5019
03:23:35,080 --> 03:23:38,560
Get out of here, Carrier Boy.

5020
03:23:39,260 --> 03:23:40,300
Get out of here, Carrier Boy.

5021
03:23:52,800 --> 03:23:54,840
Oh gosh, they're so expensive.

5022
03:23:56,360 --> 03:23:58,680
I never looked at these prices before.

5023
03:23:59,120 --> 03:24:04,120
Oh my god, what if I spent $65, but I don't get it?

5024
03:24:04,580 --> 03:24:09,260
If it makes you feel better, it took me 1910 rolls for Summer Hoshino, so I just went ahead and pitied for Hina.

5025
03:24:09,420 --> 03:24:11,500
That's basically me right now, Takezo.

5026
03:24:13,340 --> 03:24:15,320
I'm like, maybe I should just...

5027
03:24:15,320 --> 03:24:17,120
I mean, I've already sparred.

5028
03:24:17,220 --> 03:24:20,560
I can recruit her without buying.

5029
03:24:29,020 --> 03:24:31,080
The packages are expensive.

5030
03:24:35,480 --> 03:24:37,800
$65 for a moment of joy.

5031
03:24:38,060 --> 03:24:38,980
It's not joy!

5032
03:24:39,600 --> 03:24:40,840
It's disappointment!

5033
03:24:41,240 --> 03:24:42,100
It always is!

5034
03:24:47,460 --> 03:24:49,540
I have 204 recruitment points.

5035
03:24:49,640 --> 03:24:50,640
I can get her right now.

5036
03:24:55,700 --> 03:24:59,060
I saved 21 gems and had to pity for Dressako.

5037
03:24:59,520 --> 03:25:00,060
No!

5038
03:25:01,150 --> 03:25:02,260
But the free pulls!

5039
03:25:06,420 --> 03:25:07,780
The free pulls!

5040
03:25:11,080 --> 03:25:16,460
I think I'm just gonna...

5041
03:25:24,100 --> 03:25:25,900
Even the free pulls didn't save me.

5042
03:25:26,540 --> 03:25:27,480
I'm so sorry.

5043
03:25:28,040 --> 03:25:29,120
How was Anime Fest?

5044
03:25:29,280 --> 03:25:29,760
A blast!

5045
03:25:30,260 --> 03:25:31,160
I had so much fun!

5046
03:25:33,900 --> 03:25:35,840
Safer maid Midoriya Momoi.

5047
03:25:36,020 --> 03:25:36,140
Oh!

5048
03:25:38,080 --> 03:25:38,560
Okay.

5049
03:25:41,560 --> 03:25:46,440
I was gonna spark for Aqua since they gave us 100 free rolls, but then she showed up on roll 200!

5050
03:25:47,560 --> 03:25:48,040
Yeah!

5051
03:25:57,650 --> 03:25:58,170
No!

5052
03:25:58,210 --> 03:25:58,870
No, not Momoi.

5053
03:26:01,910 --> 03:26:02,430
Momoi.

5054
03:26:03,750 --> 03:26:04,610
Momoi is cute.

5055
03:26:05,830 --> 03:26:06,690
Okay, you guys.

5056
03:26:06,710 --> 03:26:08,650
I'm gonna... I'm just gonna spark for Hoshino.

5057
03:26:09,590 --> 03:26:11,290
I'm gonna spark for Hoshino!

5058
03:26:12,990 --> 03:26:14,450
I'm pressing the button!

5059
03:26:14,650 --> 03:26:15,770
I'm pressing the button!

5060
03:26:19,140 --> 03:26:20,720
It feels so...

5061
03:26:29,260 --> 03:26:30,500
Come here, Sensei.

5062
03:26:30,500 --> 03:26:31,440
It's really cool here.

5063
03:26:44,720 --> 03:26:45,440
Yay!

5064
03:26:47,300 --> 03:26:48,820
I got her.

5065
03:26:51,340 --> 03:26:51,840
Yay!

5066
03:26:53,440 --> 03:26:54,440
Hoshino!

5067
03:27:03,380 --> 03:27:09,600
Well, I have all the units for the Fest now.

5068
03:27:12,440 --> 03:27:14,140
Sorry, that's Chirino.

5069
03:27:16,200 --> 03:27:18,280
Imagine you do a single pull and she pops up.

5070
03:27:18,380 --> 03:27:18,960
Okay, I'll try.

5071
03:27:19,600 --> 03:27:20,700
One single pull!

5072
03:27:22,460 --> 03:27:23,040
Let's see.

5073
03:27:28,840 --> 03:27:29,280
Nope.

5074
03:27:29,420 --> 03:27:30,180
Wait, memory.

5075
03:27:30,360 --> 03:27:31,140
What if it flips?

5076
03:27:31,200 --> 03:27:31,740
That'd be crazy.

5077
03:27:36,120 --> 03:27:36,860
No, I'm just kidding.

5078
03:27:40,880 --> 03:27:41,320
Haruka.

5079
03:27:44,060 --> 03:27:44,500
Yeah.

5080
03:27:50,050 --> 03:27:52,410
How many Elves do I have now?

5081
03:27:52,510 --> 03:27:53,310
I'm so curious.

5082
03:27:54,050 --> 03:27:54,790
Let's see.

5083
03:27:56,290 --> 03:27:56,850
Shop.

5084
03:28:01,740 --> 03:28:02,800
My Eligma.

5085
03:28:03,160 --> 03:28:06,200
I have 7,206.

5086
03:28:11,370 --> 03:28:13,150
I got Dressina at 20.

5087
03:28:13,250 --> 03:28:14,190
Shut up, Raybag!

5088
03:28:14,410 --> 03:28:14,870
Shut up!

5089
03:28:17,570 --> 03:28:19,610
I never spend them, ever.

5090
03:28:19,610 --> 03:28:21,930
I never spend them.

5091
03:28:23,290 --> 03:28:24,430
I hoard everything.

5092
03:28:27,470 --> 03:28:33,370
Like for my normal tickets, like just the regular currency thing.

5093
03:28:33,970 --> 03:28:38,570
I have 200 million.

5094
03:28:41,150 --> 03:28:43,510
I have 212 million.

5095
03:28:46,230 --> 03:28:47,490
Hoarder Oshii.

5096
03:28:47,750 --> 03:28:48,490
Yeah.

5097
03:28:48,490 --> 03:28:54,030
I never also, I never also use like the, what's it called?

5098
03:28:55,130 --> 03:28:57,210
The select, you know how you can do the, oops.

5099
03:28:57,330 --> 03:28:57,990
I pressed the wrong thing.

5100
03:28:59,510 --> 03:29:00,510
Did you hear Arona?

5101
03:29:00,670 --> 03:29:01,630
Hold on, she'll say my name.

5102
03:29:04,150 --> 03:29:05,050
Wait, hold on.

5103
03:29:05,090 --> 03:29:06,870
No, Arona, say my name.

5104
03:29:06,930 --> 03:29:07,810
Don't embarrass me now.

5105
03:29:10,490 --> 03:29:10,850
Nevermind.

5106
03:29:11,330 --> 03:29:11,690
Nevermind.

5107
03:29:15,700 --> 03:29:16,600
You heard it?

5108
03:29:16,680 --> 03:29:17,860
You heard the Minto-sensei?

5109
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:18,160
Yeah.

5110
03:29:21,180 --> 03:29:22,600
Oh, she's camera shy.

5111
03:29:23,800 --> 03:29:24,260
What's it?

5112
03:29:24,380 --> 03:29:26,820
The, you know when you can like level up your character?

5113
03:29:26,940 --> 03:29:27,780
I always just...

5114
03:29:28,960 --> 03:29:33,180
When you have to get like the Blu-rays and things, I always just save up for them.

5115
03:29:33,260 --> 03:29:36,140
I never use the selectable ones.

5116
03:29:37,220 --> 03:29:40,860
So maybe that's why I'm like a little lower level than stuff.

5117
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:44,740
But, you know, I like to save up everything.

5118
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:45,380
Okay.

5119
03:29:48,160 --> 03:29:49,980
But now, I have a dress Hina.

5120
03:29:50,580 --> 03:29:52,900
And I can put her right next to swimsuit Hina.

5121
03:29:53,260 --> 03:29:54,440
And regular Hina.

5122
03:30:00,120 --> 03:30:05,020
Wait, what does she look like when you pick her up?

5123
03:30:07,840 --> 03:30:08,680
Wait, hold on.

5124
03:30:08,880 --> 03:30:09,920
What does she look like?

5125
03:30:10,120 --> 03:30:13,000
Let me just go into a random mission.

5126
03:30:23,460 --> 03:30:23,860
Wait.

5127
03:30:25,260 --> 03:30:26,080
Where is she?

5128
03:30:26,680 --> 03:30:27,600
Where is she?

5129
03:30:28,420 --> 03:30:29,420
Where is she?

5130
03:30:29,960 --> 03:30:30,420
Where is she?

5131
03:30:30,420 --> 03:30:30,700
Hina.

5132
03:30:40,120 --> 03:30:41,140
She's so cute!

5133
03:30:46,100 --> 03:30:47,180
Her little...

5134
03:30:54,220 --> 03:30:56,080
Irene, welcome to Mabushop.

5135
03:30:56,220 --> 03:30:58,960
Listening to my ghost Oshii giggle and drool.

5136
03:30:59,720 --> 03:31:00,880
Yeah, she picks up.

5137
03:31:01,380 --> 03:31:02,740
Hina, Blue Archive.

5138
03:31:02,820 --> 03:31:04,560
Blue Archive, please sponsor me.

5139
03:31:04,560 --> 03:31:05,720
I'm your targeted audience.

5140
03:31:09,220 --> 03:31:10,240
She's so cute.

5141
03:31:10,460 --> 03:31:11,480
Look at her go around.

5142
03:31:11,760 --> 03:31:12,180
Hold on.

5143
03:31:12,220 --> 03:31:13,680
My other favorite is Koharu.

5144
03:31:13,940 --> 03:31:15,080
Where are you, Koharu?

5145
03:31:31,010 --> 03:31:31,570
Vancherino.

5146
03:31:31,810 --> 03:31:32,250
Sorry.

5147
03:31:33,150 --> 03:31:33,930
Let go of me.

5148
03:31:41,610 --> 03:31:42,010
I'm gonna go into the cafe.

5149
03:31:42,010 --> 03:31:43,170
I can't wait to pat her head.

5150
03:31:43,430 --> 03:31:44,230
Oh gosh.

5151
03:31:44,530 --> 03:31:45,510
I'm gonna go...

5152
03:31:45,510 --> 03:31:45,730
Wait.

5153
03:31:46,170 --> 03:31:47,150
I'm gonna go to the cafe.

5154
03:31:48,490 --> 03:31:49,490
Can I summon her?

5155
03:31:49,730 --> 03:31:50,310
Oh no.

5156
03:31:50,570 --> 03:31:51,450
I don't have any.

5157
03:31:51,910 --> 03:31:53,310
I can't invite her, yet.

5158
03:31:53,650 --> 03:31:56,030
I'm gonna invite her and then I'm gonna give her...

5159
03:31:57,790 --> 03:32:01,070
I'm gonna give her the big stuff and I'm gonna get her recollection.

5160
03:32:01,230 --> 03:32:02,630
And then I'm gonna be so happy!

5161
03:32:03,850 --> 03:32:04,250
Hahahaha.

5162
03:32:06,470 --> 03:32:07,650
There's a special animation.

5163
03:32:07,650 --> 03:32:11,650
I've seen this special animation if you use Dress Ako and Dress Hina at the end.

5164
03:32:11,830 --> 03:32:13,750
I can't wait for Shiroko Terror.

5165
03:32:14,270 --> 03:32:15,310
Maybe then I'll...

5166
03:32:15,990 --> 03:32:17,670
Maybe once... maybe once...

5167
03:32:18,150 --> 03:32:19,590
I'm gonna put the music back on.

5168
03:32:21,670 --> 03:32:26,930
Maybe once Shiroko Terror comes out, if I haven't gotten Shiroko by then, I'll just pull for her.

5169
03:32:27,050 --> 03:32:27,970
Or I'll get her, you know?

5170
03:32:28,910 --> 03:32:31,190
I pulled Hoshino Swimsuit on my second 10 pull.

5171
03:32:31,870 --> 03:32:34,210
I'm so happy for you.

5172
03:32:38,570 --> 03:32:39,550
I'm going to be...

5173
03:32:39,550 --> 03:32:42,570
I'm going to a famous hot dog restaurant this weekend!

5174
03:32:43,190 --> 03:32:45,010
I'll make sure to leave you one as an offering.

5175
03:32:45,210 --> 03:32:46,430
What kind of toppings do you want?

5176
03:32:46,850 --> 03:32:48,010
Onion, onion, onion!

5177
03:32:49,970 --> 03:32:50,370
Yeah!

5178
03:32:50,510 --> 03:32:51,670
Oh, sounds delicious!

5179
03:32:52,650 --> 03:32:54,190
What's a famous hot dog place?

5180
03:32:54,850 --> 03:32:55,650
Hifumi Daisuke.

5181
03:32:56,510 --> 03:32:57,250
Oh my gosh!

5182
03:32:57,450 --> 03:32:58,410
Jelly straight up butt doctor!

5183
03:33:00,490 --> 03:33:01,350
Hifumi's pretty cute.

5184
03:33:04,030 --> 03:33:06,170
Going to the gym for the first time in like 8 months tonight!

5185
03:33:06,270 --> 03:33:06,870
Can you possess me?

5186
03:33:06,970 --> 03:33:07,630
And go for a walk?

5187
03:33:07,650 --> 03:33:08,090
No.

5188
03:33:08,950 --> 03:33:11,150
If not, can I get some encouraging words instead?

5189
03:33:11,970 --> 03:33:13,170
Work, work, work!

5190
03:33:13,770 --> 03:33:14,710
Get those gains!

5191
03:33:15,470 --> 03:33:16,250
Minto gains!

5192
03:33:18,550 --> 03:33:19,270
Ghosty gains!

5193
03:33:19,930 --> 03:33:21,090
Your space is ghost!

5194
03:33:21,370 --> 03:33:22,130
Ghosty gains!

5195
03:33:22,350 --> 03:33:22,910
Ghosty gains!

5196
03:33:23,310 --> 03:33:24,510
Hashtag ghosty gains!

5197
03:33:26,730 --> 03:33:28,390
Costco is most famous.

5198
03:33:29,630 --> 03:33:31,830
Oh, my favorite character in Blue Archive!

5199
03:33:32,270 --> 03:33:33,390
I have three.

5200
03:33:33,650 --> 03:33:35,770
Cherino, Koharu, and Hina.

5201
03:33:37,930 --> 03:33:38,790
Minto gains!

5202
03:33:39,370 --> 03:33:39,490
Yeah!

5203
03:33:41,490 --> 03:33:46,570
It's a place in New Jersey that does deep-fried hot dogs called Rippers!

5204
03:33:47,990 --> 03:33:49,370
That sounds amazing.

5205
03:33:51,010 --> 03:33:51,570
Wow.

5206
03:33:52,370 --> 03:33:54,990
Thanks for accompanying me during my part-time job, Minto!

5207
03:33:55,450 --> 03:33:58,530
I don't work retail, but it was fun hearing you beat customers up.

5208
03:33:58,850 --> 03:33:59,890
It's also my birthday today!

5209
03:33:59,990 --> 03:34:00,630
Can I get a happy birthday?

5210
03:34:00,730 --> 03:34:01,410
Of course!

5211
03:34:03,090 --> 03:34:05,810
Happy birthday to you!

5212
03:34:06,810 --> 03:34:09,150
Happy birthday to you!

5213
03:34:10,110 --> 03:34:13,610
Happy birthday, dear SoborGuy!

5214
03:34:15,450 --> 03:34:18,730
Happy birthday to you!

5215
03:34:21,710 --> 03:34:22,730
Happy birthday!

5216
03:34:24,230 --> 03:34:25,370
SolidMarine, welcome to membership!

5217
03:34:25,670 --> 03:34:28,410
And with that, I'm going to end the stream.

5218
03:34:28,590 --> 03:34:33,670
Thank you guys for hanging out with me for all of my polls and everything.

5219
03:34:34,350 --> 03:34:36,450
Streamer luck is questionable.

5220
03:34:36,950 --> 03:34:37,150
But!

5221
03:34:38,070 --> 03:34:40,110
I will see you guys tomorrow!

5222
03:34:40,370 --> 03:34:41,230
I have a double stream.

5223
03:34:41,550 --> 03:34:44,650
One afternoon stream for me, and then another...

5224
03:34:45,770 --> 03:34:47,310
I'll be streaming on...

5225
03:34:48,450 --> 03:34:48,850
On...

5226
03:34:48,850 --> 03:34:50,930
Well, I'll be on, I think, Berry's channel?

5227
03:34:51,390 --> 03:34:51,670
I think?

5228
03:34:53,390 --> 03:34:54,210
Wow, Tsum Tsum!

5229
03:34:54,250 --> 03:34:54,970
Hoshino is so cute!

5230
03:34:55,050 --> 03:34:55,710
I just got her, too!

5231
03:34:56,090 --> 03:34:58,570
I'm so happy for you!

5232
03:35:01,330 --> 03:35:02,250
At Berry's, yeah.

5233
03:35:02,350 --> 03:35:02,670
Yeah!

5234
03:35:02,670 --> 03:35:03,770
I think that we were...

5235
03:35:03,770 --> 03:35:05,470
Before, we were still trying to decide.

5236
03:35:06,190 --> 03:35:06,910
But anyway...

5237
03:35:08,170 --> 03:35:08,530
Otsumita!

5238
03:35:09,490 --> 03:35:10,530
Have a great night!

5239
03:35:10,750 --> 03:35:12,470
Good luck with all your gacha polls.

5240
03:35:13,790 --> 03:35:15,150
And I will see you guys later!

5241
03:35:16,630 --> 03:35:16,990
Itterashai!

5242
03:35:17,250 --> 03:35:17,710
Bye bye!

5243
03:35:18,190 --> 03:35:19,750
Thank you for hanging out with me!

5244
03:35:21,070 --> 03:35:21,810
Thank you, thank you!

5245
03:35:22,090 --> 03:35:22,950
Thanks for the fun stream!

5246
03:35:23,070 --> 03:35:23,750
Thank you, Bakery!

5247
03:35:23,950 --> 03:35:24,410
Thank you!

5248
03:35:25,230 --> 03:35:25,590
And...

5249
03:35:25,950 --> 03:35:27,790
For the Akasupa earlier, thank you.

5250
03:35:27,830 --> 03:35:30,610
I will probably have to use it for Shiroko Terror, so...

5251
03:35:32,070 --> 03:35:32,650
Thank you guys!

5252
03:35:32,650 --> 03:35:33,290
Thank you guys so much!

5253
03:35:33,410 --> 03:35:34,030
Bye bye!

5254
03:35:34,230 --> 03:35:34,890
Bye bye!

5255
03:35:35,130 --> 03:35:35,570
Otsumita!

5256
03:35:35,970 --> 03:35:36,410
Otsumita!

5257
03:35:37,090 --> 03:35:37,750
Bye bye!
