i was like i smelled his little head and it smelled sweet

34
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:15,000

sign of of diabetes I was like oh no and I took him and they

were like wow he's down two pounds which they were a little
concerned about um but uh I I have him on a diet because

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:37,320
last time the time before I took him they were like he needs
to lose weight so you know he's down a little bit um it's

37
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,460
scary when pets lose

38
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,160
like the doctor checked him yesterday and was just like i
don't know i don't see anything wrong with it i don't or

He's like the best cat I've ever worked with.

45
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,880
Like he just stands there and lets you do anything.

46
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,120
Like he doesn't, he doesn't fight.

47
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,680
Like he is so good.

48
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,460
He doesn't bite.

49
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,180
He doesn't scratch.

50
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,880
He doesn't, he's so sweet.

51
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,520
And I was like, yeah, I know everybody tells me that.

52
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,280
He is my good boy.

53
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,240
But he's pregnant.

54
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,020
Close.

55
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,040
Oh my gosh, so close.

56
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:10,580
Um, uh, today the doctor was we were ooing and eyeing at
your cat's results he is like the pinnacle of healthy for a

57
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:23,000
cat his age he is so healthy like every there was like no
nothing with diabetes not even a worry like he is my vet

58
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:36,040
called my cat an unholy terror yeah so they were like His
heart is good, his kidneys are good, his everything is good.

59
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,220
We just have to look at his poop and make sure there's
nothing wrong there.

60
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,540
But he passed.

61
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,180
Yeah!

62
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,180
He is healthy!

63
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,520
Yippee!

64
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,020
So I felt so much relief after that.

65
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,720
Especially because she was so enthusiastic about it.

66
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,700
She was like, he is so healthy.

67
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,740
And I was like, well, he's a bit of a butthole, but that's
okay.

68
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,300
Did he pass gas?

69
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,700
You know, he's been, like, farting a lot recently.

70
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,700
It's, you know, he's just, you know, ghost cats are a little
gassier than others, I suppose.

71
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
But, um...

72
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,820
Can we get a Butaro...

73
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,260
A Butaro emo.

74
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,280

Cheerleader.

95
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,070

98
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:32,290
How do I make a voice that sounds like strong bad trying to
talk like a teenage girl?

99
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,310
No.

100
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,830
So as a kid, I watched so much Homestar Runner.

101
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,710
Oh my goodness.

102
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,790
I watched way so much Homestar Runner.

103
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,430
And I played this game quite a bit.

104
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,970
I don't remember at all how to beat it.

105
00:10:52,070 --> 00:11:03,270
But I would like to try and get, like, I think with 150
points, I would like to try and get every little drop out of

106
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:03,610
this game.

107
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,790

Wait.

That's another reference, isn't it?

126
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,050

127
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,350
remember.

128
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,950
But I don't remember at the same time.

129
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,430
Your impression of Strong Bad doing a teen girl voice is so
good.

130
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:14,830

I'm a super chat from the 60s.

135
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,910
But here's a few things I remember from Strong Bad Emails.

136
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,530
I remember the one when he makes an anime about himself.

137
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,570
He gives him the awesome blue hair.

138
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,550
I remember the the system is down.

139
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,890
The system is down.

140
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,270
Stinko Man!

141
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:58,990
Oh my gosh.

142
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,630
Legitimate business.

143
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,730
Yes, he has the rave that when he makes the song.

144
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,110
Dear Strongbent, what would you look like as a Japanese
cartoon?

145
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,730
And what would it be about?

146
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:25,930
Well, if I was a Japanese cartoon, I would be super
booby-licious with a bubble bite.

147
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,250
And I remember the song about the cheat.

148
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,230
The cheat.

149
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:42,530

154
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:39,350
i i tried to get my friends in a homestar runner but i got
into homestar runner from when I was a kid.

155
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:50,870
And so he and I would like do the emails and like try to
find all the little hidden clickies in it.

156
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,990
So that was a lot of fun.

157
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,210
I heard my name.

158
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,450
Well, if it is, it's Saucy Maidman.

159
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,190
Oh my gosh, it's an actual Armstrong.

160
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:03,810
Hello, Senator.

161
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,330
Oh, shoot.

162
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,150
I just realized something.

163
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,530
But it should be okay.

164
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,570
until after stream.

165
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,210
I am constantly quoting Strong Bad anytime I see a
protagonist with blue hair.

166
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,650
But yeah, so Homestar Runner was a huge part of my ghostly
childhood.

167
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,770
And so was Peasant's Quest.

00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,370
Here's how things work around here.

170
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,970
Tips for not morons, beginners.

171
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,130
Look around by typing stuff like look tree or just plain
look.

172
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:45,170
Talk to folks by typing stuff like man take items by typing
get item use items by typing use item you can also give item

173
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:51,770

176
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,630
Hold on, can I turn off the music?

177
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:13,830
No!

178
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,710
No, I'm not even reading it!

179
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,450
Hold on!

180
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,850
No, I can't do this anymore, please!

181
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:19,730
No!

182
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,370
No, no, no!

183
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,110

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,250

No, no!

187
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,990
I can't do this anymore!

188
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,150
Please, maybe it...

189
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,610
Hold on.

190
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,350
I will.

191
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,370
You could start playing it in a second.

192
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,790
Here.

193
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,590
Maybe it doesn't play the whole game, right?

194
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,070
Go for it.

195
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,130
Oh!

196
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:48,890
Yes!

197
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,850
Okay, I'm going to restart that.

198
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,570
I'm going to restart that so we can...

199
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,630
I'll read it to you guys.

200
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,730
I'll read it to you guys.

201
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,910
I never felt so young until now.

202
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:02,310
Oh!

203
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,710
Tongue looks like a thong?

204
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,150
Oh my god, now that you say that, it really does kind of
look like a thong.

205
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,590
No, I didn't want it to be that.

206
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,410
I didn't want it to be that sexy.

207
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,790
Okay, here we go.

208
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:45,090
okay okay okay all right let me read now this hey didn't
thank you so much for the 10 gifts thank you you are rather

209
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:51,090
dashing oh thank you a humble peasant living in the peasant
kingdom of peasantry you return home from a vacation on

210
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,870
scalding lake only to find that shrug door the burninator
has burninated your thatched cottage roof cottage along with

211
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,090
all your goods and services is that what i said with nothing
less left to lose.

212
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:06,630
You swear to get revenge on the wingling dragon in the name
of Burnin... You head east towards the mountain atop which

213
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,990
Tronkdor lives.

214
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,270
That's a nice looking lake.

215
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,530
You can start playing in a second here.

216
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,910
Oh, my thatched roof cottages.

217
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,250
Thatched roof cottages!

218
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,870
Hello, sir.

219
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,970
Oh, talk.

220
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,470
You explain your situation to the knight.

221
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,730
The Trogdor burn it in your cottage, and you've sworn
revenge.

222
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,530
You ask for passage to the mountain to settle your score.

223
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,390
Hang on there, Trogdorkilla, says the knight.

224
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:51,650
I can only allow actual peasants up the mountain past to
face Trogdor, and you clearly are not one.

225
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,510
Look, Dragonheart.

226
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,110
Fine, thanks for the tiny captain, thank you.

227
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,730
You don't stink like a peasant.

228
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,250
You don't dress like a peasant.

229
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,350
Actually, I feel like I do dress like a peasant.

230
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,270
And you are definitely not on fire like a peasant.

231
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:14,790
Once there are those three things, come back and maybe we
can talk.

232
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:20,510
Be sure to look around lots, talk to everyone you see, and
ask about stuff.

233
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,410
Type help if you get confused in inventory to see your
worldly stuff.

234
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,770
Load your game, duh.

235
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,870
If I just walk, I don't stop.

236
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,650
Look at me, I'm so dashing.

237
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,390
Do I need to put on some BGM for this game?

238
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,850
Actually, I don't know why I thought there might be BGM, but
here I go.

239
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,210
I'm walking here.

240
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,210
I can't stop walking.

241
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,330
Actually, is there...

242
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,690
Oh, there is a way to stop.

243
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,810
I'm going in.

244
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,450
I'm going down.

245
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,750
Man!

246
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:55,870
Look.

247
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,410
Why, it's half a lake with a fisherman in it.

248
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:10,710
fishing yell oh talk you holler at the old man about trogdor
but he just grumbles about the fish not biting must be the

249
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:25,770
wrong I must be using the wrong bait he says oh sorry must
be using the wrong bait he says suggestively can I fish fish

250
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,670
swim damn How do you say that suggestively?

251
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,590
Okay, I'm going to put on a little bit of BGM real quick.

252
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,710
Because it's kind of quiet.

253
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,450
Unless you guys don't have...

254
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,290
It's basically a podcast at this point.

255
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,830
Or I can sing the song again.

256
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,070
Oh, the press and minus.

257
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,130
Thank you.

258
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:48,710
Oh.

259
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,490
Oh, we're so fast.

260
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,170
Nice.

261
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,270
Um.

262
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,150
Um.

263
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:01,810
Um.

264
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,270
Where's my music?

265
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,770
Oh, here we go.

266
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,850
What do you guys want to listen to?

267
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,550
Let's listen to some chill music.

268
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:25,770
This doesn't really fit the vibe, but just pretend it's like
after school and you're on your like Windows 98.

269
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,790
Actually, I don't know when this game came out.

270
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,850
I don't know if it's older or newer.

271
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,570
And you're playing, and it's old.

272
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,990
Mm-hmm.

273
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,630
Oh, here we go.

274
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,690
Oh, yeah, we're speedy now.

275
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,730
Wait, is this my house?

276
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:47,550
Eat.

277
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,550
Take, take berries.

278
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,390
You probably wish you could get that.

279
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,970
Oh, dang.

280
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:54,410
Okay.

281
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,580
What's here?

282
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,260
Knock?

283
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,400
It's open.

284
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,080
Oh, sorry.

285
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,540
It's open, says a female voice from inside.

286
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,420
Um, it's not open.

287
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,740
But you get her drift.

288
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,040
You open her up and head on in.

289
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, she's got a baby.

290
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:20,860
Talk.

291
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,220
Hello, I'm, you start, but the lady cuts you off.

292
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,120
Okay, here's why I let you in here, she explains.

293
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,700
My husband got squished by Trogdoor.

294
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:37,600
And to make matters worse, insurance riches I got were just
stolen by the Janka.

295
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,020
Go steal them back for us and I'll give you something great.

296
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,040
ViviCorps thinks you're the gifted.

297
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,120
I never thought I'd see you play Baldur's Gate 3.

298
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,080
Yeah, I think we're gonna go see Asterion.

299
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:53,760
Take.

300
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,700
No, talk.

301
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,500
Oh, okay.

302
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:56,920
It's a say.

303
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,440
Take.

304
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,060
Grab.

305
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,080
Look.

306
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,400
What a depletion.

307
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,440
pressing little cottage.

308
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,880
It reeks of single parent.

309
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,220
I mean, oh my gosh.

310
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,200
They said he is rather dashing, but they never said he is
rather classy.

311
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,020
Dang.

312
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,520
Oh my gosh.

313
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,180
A lady rocks her baby in a chair.

314
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,840
A mostly empty shelf sits against one wall.

315
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,660
Mm-hmm.

316
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,620
Rather savage.

317
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,400
For real.

318
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:51,480

You're hanging out in the in baby lady cottage.

323
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,970
Can I take baby?

324
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:16,910
Take baby.

325
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,370
You want to be part of this family?

326
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,970
Go get us those riches!

327
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,850
She shrieks.

328
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:23,570
Dang.

329
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,930
What is this though?

330
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,630
Take, take feed?

331
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:31,210
Oh, you used to eat this stuff like crazy when you were a
kid and your parents weren't watching.

332
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,710
Which was all too often.

333
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,230
You grabbed several large handfuls.

334
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,370
Oh, we got a point, we got a point!

342
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:05,060
okay here we go search search i really like the last podcast
episode and did that personality quiz and i ended up with

343
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:14,820
the same result as you great minds think alike right search
bush Oh, nothing in this bush, but squished berries either.

344
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,380
Let's check this one.

345
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,780
You guys are so smart at saying search, yes.

346
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,500
Search bush.

347
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,160
Too bad you don't want any squished berries.

348
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,800
Because, hey, jackpot.

349
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,540
Maybe I shouldn't be so aggressive.

350
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,280
Like, search bush.

351
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,640
You reach into the bush to snag you some berries, but
instead find a super trinket.

352
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,580
Get ye flask.

353

357
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,380
Oh, it's so cute!

358
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,420
This has got to be your favorite t-shirt ever.

359
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,920
Oh, the times you had at Scalding Lake.

360

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,460
This super trinket is weird.

364
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:37,220
It looks like it could either kill you or make you the hit
of your Christmas party.

Get out of here.

402
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,380
Peep-pe-pe-pe-pe-peep.

403
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,240
Um.

404
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,520
This is a really creepy screen.

405
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,940
Why does it look like this?

406
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,640
Crank that hog.

407
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,900
Um, look.

00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:26,700
Ah!

410
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:27,780
Ah!

411
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,240
Nothing special here except for that weird wavy tree!

412
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,040
Who is that?

413
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,520
Look!

414
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,200
Man!

415
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,440
Talk!

416
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,240
You startle him and he disappears!

417
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,320
Oh, God!

418
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,360
Oh my gosh!

419
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,360

420
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,520
What a suspicious man!

421
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,000

That!

425
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,140
I remember that.

426
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,000
You slide the stone over to reveal a little hole.

427
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,540
If only you could cut off your arms, legs, and head, you
might be able to squeeze through.

428
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,660
Yippee!

429
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,380
I remember that one.

430
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:23,100
much of anything else though knock you can knock until your
knuckles bleed nobody's home i'm a ghost i can fit through

431
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:34,980
you know who could fit through the baby oh talk your
attempts at conversation are met with horse grunts and tail

432
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:42,320
flaps which is better than you do then it's just which is
better than Can you do a conversation with most people?

433
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,700
Pet horse.

434
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,140
Oh, that's sweet.

435
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,940
Poor Gary tries in vain to bite your arm off.

436
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,700
Thank you for the dog.

437
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,200
That's a horse?

438
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,940
What is this?

439
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,340
Oh, wait.

440
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Look.

441
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,420
There's a rotten old horse.

442
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,280
It's a horse.

443
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,340
He doesn't look so good, though.

444
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,580
Take Gary.

445
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,540
Oh my goodness.

446
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,020
You probably wish you could.

447
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,260
Eat flies.

448
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,280
Oh, there's the flies.

449
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
Eat flies.

450
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,340
Hmm.

451
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,320
How hungry.

452
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,320
He looks pretty.

453
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,700
You're hanging out in poor Gary's Glen.

454
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,260
Why is he?

455
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,200
Why does someone take care of Gary so he's not so poor
anymore?

456
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,410
Please don't get kicked.

457
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:46,230
Oh, what's in here?

458
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,550
Search head.

459
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,820
Sorry, sometimes my fingers work in really mysterious ways,
you guys.

460
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:18,440
Sometimes my fingers work in really, really mysterious ways,
and I don't know why.

461
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,180
That's after stream.

462
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,920
Dang it.

463
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:50,360
You'll probably see me making crazy mistakes all the time,
this whole stream.

464
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,400
Did you find the rainbow?

465
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,320
Did you find anything?

466
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,200
Just some edible glitter.

467
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,460
It's your sleeves.

468
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,140
Exactly.

469
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,180
Also the G and the H are right next to each other.

470
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,540
Okay.

471
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,160
You search and search through the haystack.

472
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:22,640
Nope.

473
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,340
No needles.

474
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,800
Someone had a good idea.

475
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,620
Take hay.

476
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,600
What do you think you are?

477
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,080
Some kind of thigh dungeon man?

478
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,520
You don't need any hay.

479
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:32,960
Okay.

480
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,620
What about for the horse?

481
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,440
Can I climb this tree?

482
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,420
Climb tree.

483
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,380
But then all your hands will get all sappy.

484
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,380
Hmm.

My house!

505
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:34,190
The remains of your thatched roof cottage lie burdenated
before you.

506
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,490
You swear revenge against Trogdor.

507
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,630
You're hanging out in your burdenated cottage.

508
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,090
Mint, if this is how you wanted to come out to us, this is
really complicated.

509
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,930
I'll put it in it.

510
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,430
Stop!

511
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:58,310
One of my manga shelves broke down yesterday, and a lot of
the manga on that one had black covers, so the damage is

512
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,950
really noticeable.

513
00:36:59,850 --> 00:36:59,890
Pain!

514
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,090
No!

515
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,430
Oh my gosh, I'm so scared of that day.

516
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,370
That, like, my shelf just decides to break.

517
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,930
I hope never.

518
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,270
I have so many dojin.

519
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,070
Oh, can I take the berries here?

520
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,830
Take berries.

521
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,050
No!

522
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:31,170

sandy shore there's some rocks here though take rocks you

523
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:43,150
grab a handful of fairly substantial pebbles you make sure
to get an even mix of sedentary igneous and um surreptitious

524
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:57,330
rocks yeah wait oh I know what to do with the chicken feed I
just the guy fishing the guy fishing said that nothing was

525
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:12,410

feed you toss the feed into the lake you shed a tear for

526
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,230

527
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:29,460
goodbye Delga Rasputin farewell combo done that's so forth

528
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,980
ho ho Whoa!

529
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,540
That crotchety old man just caught a pant load of fish.

530
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:46,960
Now I can get back to running the inn, he says, and rose to
shore and hauls his boat out and cleans guts and flays all

531
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,880
the fish and a bunch of other stuff we didn't animate.

532
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,360
Yippee!

533
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,100
Oh my gosh, we're making awesome time.

534
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,740
Oh, the inn was right here the whole time.

535
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,360
There's a giant inn here.

536
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,200
Takes up, like, the entire screen.

537
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,500
Just open it, man.

538
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,020
Open.

539
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,360
Open the door and step inside the inn.

540
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,580
Oh, he's back.

541
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,060
I'm going in here, too, then.

542
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,040
Open.

543
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,720
Look.

544
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,500
What a dump.

545
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,660
Only one bed and no mini-bar.

546
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,740
The innkeeper stands behind a desk, and there's a door
that's closed.

547
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,980
Open door.

548
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,640
That's the pantry, says the innkeeper.

549
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,880
Employees only.

550
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
It's wild how much Skyrim ripped off this game.

551
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:36,960
I...

552
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,300
Right!

553
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,440
Like...

554
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,860
Like, this game is so innovative.

555
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:48,780
To every game following it has just taken everything from
it.

556
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,480
Peasants' quest walks so Baldur's Gate 3 could run.

557
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,120
Could we get a job here?

558
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:02,600
I don't know.

559
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:02,960
Sleep?

560
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,720
You probably ought to talk to that stinky old guy over there
about that.

561
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,240
Okay.

562
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,820
Hello, sir.

563
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,880
I would like to inquire about a job.

564
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,800
If you're interested in staying the night, just type get a
room.

565
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,640
Get a room.

566
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,620
I only serve peasants here, fancy pants.

567
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,860
Bark's the old guy.

568
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,120
Where's your robe?

569
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,660
Why are they so mean to me?

570
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,880
Oh.

571
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,880
What is this?

572
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,760
A single...

573
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,860
A signal lantern of some kind hangs from a severely
bernanated tree.

574
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,900
Where am I?

575
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,040
I'm at the burninated trees.

576
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,460
Okay.

577
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,660
Um, this is nice.

578
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,500
There's a beautiful magical waterfall cascading down the
cliffside.

579
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,920
I'm gonna swim.

580
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:05,520
That waterfall would probably turn you into one of those
weight gain protein smoothies.

581
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,180
So sad.

582
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,660
Burninated?

583
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,900
Oh yeah.

584
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,920
That's what Tragdor does.

585
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,380
He burninates the countryside.

586
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,080
He burninates all the people.

587
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,640
He's burninating all the thatch roof cottages.

588
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,320
Okay, so I need to figure out a way to kill this guy.

589
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,880
Oh, not here.

590
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:27,880
Where is he?

591
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,260
What?

592
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,240
Is he a down one?

593
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,800
Oh!

594
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,680
Hello!

595
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,340
Oh, hi.

596
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,920
I'm Mendelev, says the archer.

597
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:51,380
a shooting range here with my brother Dongolev but we don't
talk so much anymore I haven't seen him in a dronka's age if

598
00:41:51,380 --> 00:42:01,320
you ever run into him tell him I said Haldoh you mean hello
you ask um no shut up I said Haldoh and I met Haldoh tell

599
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:14,520
him I said Haldoh dang can I play play game the gallery's
not open and you got no bow or arrows Cupid Holdo,

600
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:14,960
everybody.

601
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,580
And I said what I said.

602
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,540
Not much to see.

603
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,400
River's got a rock in it.

604
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,880
Take rock.

605
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,020
For what?

606
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,240
Now you're just making up puzzles to solve.

607
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:31,660
Sorry.

608
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,060
Wait, if I go back here, then I go up.

609
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,760
Okay, we're here.

610
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,720
This map makes no sense.

611
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,660
Holdo, everybody.

612
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,060
Does this lead to Janka?

613
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,460
No, it leads to mud.

614
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,340
Then this leads to Janka.

615
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,980
No, it leads to hay.

616
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:59,390
Can you swim here?

617
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:00,890
I don't know.

618
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,490
I still use Holdo to say hello to my friends.

619
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:07,810
So crazy.

620
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,210
This game is too influential.

621
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,050
Wait, how do I get him out?

622
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,130
Wait!

623
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,010
Maybe the super trinket.

624
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:22,690
Or...

625
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,970
Can I throw the pebbles at...

626
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:25,990
Maybe the...

627
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:29,750
Maybe I can stone that guy to death.

628
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:31,850
Whatever his name is.

629
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:33,930
Ow!

630
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,310
Talk to Janka?

631
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:38,690
Okay.

632
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:40,770
Rock and stone.

633
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,030
I thought I tried to talk to him.

634
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,010
Did I not?

635
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,150
Talk.

636
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,670
Talk to...

637
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,710
How do I spell his name?

638
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,330
So glad to see my favorite ghost playing such a great game!

639
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:53,170
Thanks Black Knight!

640
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,290
Thank you for the pink!

641
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,010
Thank you!

642
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:58,350
Wait, how do I... Talk to... How do I spell his name?

643
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,570
Oh, there we go.

644
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,550
It's sad when you have to make up people to talk to!

645
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:04,670
Man.

646
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,230
Person in my chat yelling in all caps.

647
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:09,650
Talk to talk!

648
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:11,410
You're wrong!

649
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:12,850
Is this it?

650
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,730
Okay, um...

651
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,250
Okay, hold on.

652
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,830
Throw pebbles.

653
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,640
Stone him.

654
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,380
Death him.

655
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:27,860
Kill.

656
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,840
Will I die here if I, uh...

657
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,900
Oh, where am I?

658
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,300
Oh, there I am.

659
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,800
I will die?

660
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,860
Slash kill.

661
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,400
Hmm.

662
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,280
I think the guy he'll want this.

663
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,660
Okay, is there anywhere...

664
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:52,940
Map?

665
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:53,640
Is there a map?

666
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:59,520
We are neither confirming nor denying the presence of a map
in this game, but...

667
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,260
Irregardless.

668
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,740
You don't have one.

669
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,060
Save?

670
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:06,620
Okay.

671
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,280
Oh.

672
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,620
Oh, it does auto-save, you guys.

673
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,320
I think we're okay.

674
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,680
But I'll save anyway.

675
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:25,130
Okay, go away.

676
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:26,190
Thank you.

677
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,710
What have...

678
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,830
This one?

679
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:36,590
Use.

680
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,650
What else can I type here?

681
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,620
Earward disregardless.

682
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,760
Doctor, welcome to membership.

683
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:50,500
Thank you.

684
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,820
Turn crank.

685
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
Turn crank.

686
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,580
It won't budge.

687
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,400
Maybe if there was something heavy in that bucket.

688
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:01,840
Take bucket.

689
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,020
You can't.

690
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,880
It's tied to a rope and you're terrible with nuts.

691
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,280
Jump in?

692
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,000
Dang.

693
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,580
Can you imagine?

694
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,740
Like there's this area here.

695
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,340
Great game choice.

696
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,760
Love home star runner stuff.

697
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,420
Do you think Strong Bad is a V-Tuber?

698
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,300
I think so.

699
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,700
He just used email instead of chat.

700
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,940
Wasn't there a strong bad VTuber that was made, though?

701
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,180
Like, actually?

702
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,000
Or am I going crazy?

703
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,260
What's above the inn?

704
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,680
Ah, wait, what's up here, then?

705
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,320
Ah.

706
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,140
Now we're on the other side.

707
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,360
Oh.

708
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,000
The world is so small and confusing.

709
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,620
Burger buns, welcome to membership, and Leanne, welcome to
membership thing.

710
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,640
Thank you.

711
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:57,430
Hmm.

712
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,060
Try make friends or buy Karak a cold one.

713
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,160
I don't think I even have a place where can I even buy a
cold one.

714
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,680
The inn is useless.

715
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,040
Okay, I need a robe.

716
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,840
We need to, I think, okay, we need to figure out how we're
going to kill this guy.

717
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,740
The Karak.

718
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,920
But we also need to talk to his brother.

719
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,120
Okay.

720
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,200
Did you just prove this world is round and small?

721
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,400
So very small.

722
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,780
Call me Galileo.

723
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,340
Magnifico.

724
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,720
Mento, toe, toe, toe, toe, toe, toe.

725
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,240
Mama mia, mama mia.

726
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,490
Did you try to seduce him?

727
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:04,690
Seduce him.

728
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:09,530
Uh, kiss, kiss archer.

729
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:11,610
Um.

730
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,440
Can I take this?

731
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,440
Take arrow.

732
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,520
They have range printed on them, so it would be kind of
embarrassing to have to shoot around with them.

733
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,680
Also, that guy over there is giving you the evil eye.

734
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:28,700
Okay.

735
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,880
Exodized, welcome to membership.

736
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:31,860
Thank you.

737
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,260
See, I think the bucket is used for this, right?

738
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:47,440
bucket full of water and maybe that's what we need to do but
it won't it won't move or it won't yeah we can't get it out

life what do you propose to do with them discuss oh put

742
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:51,920

this?

745
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,800
Why is there a monster mascus in there?

746
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,580
No doubt left over from some pagan ritual.

747
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,780
Silly pagans.

748
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,280
You grab up the scary monster mascus.

749
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,520
Man, this thing could scare a horse!

750
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,620
Wear mask.

751
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,060
Not on this screen.

752
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,320
You've got to image...

753
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,280
Wait, you've got your... You've got your image to think
about.

754
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,660
Oh, actually, you might want to start deliberating on that
right now.

755
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:59,520
to the horse to old Gary stinky Gary Gary's gonna be really
sad about this though I think sorry I can't read you guys

756
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:15,200
okay it's very hard with ghost eyes okay I died with poor
vision okay where mask.

757
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,760
You slip on the hideous monster mask.

758
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,180
Oh wait!

759
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,020
I wanted to see the description of it first.

760
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:22,900
Oh!

761
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,880
You scared the crap out of poor Gary!

762
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,440
He broke on through to the other side.

763
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,480
Oh my god, it's terrifying.

764
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:38,620
Man, those pagans sure can make a freaky looking mask when
they want to.

765
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,740
It's like those theater masks.

766
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,040
Uncle, evil uncle or something.

767
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,500
Yeah, basically.

768
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,440
When I was...

769
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,680
This did not happen to me.

770
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,240
But it happened to my sister.

771
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,300
Um...

772
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:54,640
Hold on.

773
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:01,690
My...

774
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:03,630
This brother!

775
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:05,290
Wait, can I?

776
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:11,550
My grandpa went to go pick up my sister.

777
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:13,990
And...

778
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,090
It was when she was in kindergarten.

779
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:17,490
Okay.

780
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:31,650
And he decided to wear a scary mask and barge into the
kindergarten going And he got banned from doing that he

781
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:37,510
Wasn't allowed to pick up my sister anymore

782
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:50,570
Save save What if oh Hopefully this guy will have some sense
and not shoot you.

783
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:52,390
Oh.

784
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:54,650
Oh.

785
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:56,630
That guy has no sense.

786
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,050
He shot you.

787
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,630
Dumb, dumb, dumb.

788
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:02,310
Nice one, William Tell.

789
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:03,070
You dead.

790
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,210
Thanks for playing.

791
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:09,470
Yippee!

792
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:13,090
Okay.

793
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:13,990
That was fun.

794
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,810
That was a good little...

795
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:16,010
Okay.

796
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,110
Now we say Haldo.

797
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:21,410
Archer stops arching, arching, and turns to you.

798
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:26,310
My brother told you to tell me, Haldoh, he must want to
start the old business backup.

799
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,270
Yeah, Mortis.

800
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:34,770
Oh my gosh.

801
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:36,230
I love that game.

802
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:36,930
How'd you know?

803
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:39,750
I love that game.

804
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,070
Take arrow.

805
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:45,070
You pick out a really good one and yank it from the tree.

806
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:45,750
Hooray!

807
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,170
Now you have an arrow.

808
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:50,030
Hooray!

809
00:53:50,950 --> 00:54:07,460
all right now we're getting somewhere you guys now we go
back to the archer right I want to see how they're doing our

810
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:17,640
favorite brothers look at them they're so happy talk Haldoh
says the brothers test your skill give us the right super

811
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:25,640
item from your inventory and you can give it as many tries
as you need we have a Give trinket.

812
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,240
That'll work, says Mendeleev.

813
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:34,280
Just hit three bulls' eyes, and you win the super time fun
bow TM.

814
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:40,200
The arrow keys aim left and right on the space bar operates
the bow.

815
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,980
You'll need to press it a couple of times to get a nice shot
off.

816
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,940
But we don't give lessons, so you're on your own.

817
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,100
Okay.

818
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:54,160
I think we'll get it first try

819
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:03,000
Oh I knew how it worked

820
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:12,020
Close Oh my gosh, wait, there's wind too So we need to go
over this way, right?

821
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:22,220
Like as As Oh Oh Oh Oh Did you guys see that?

822
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,600
That was professional gaming?

823
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:28,180
Oh!

824
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,180
Professional gaming?

825
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,760
I mean, I told you so.

826
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,200
I told you guys.

827
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,200
I told you guys.

828
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,620
I told you guys I would get it first try.

829
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,660
I told you guys.

830
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,300
I told you guys.

831
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:58,900
I told you guys.

832
00:55:59,020 --> 00:55:59,460
Pro gamer.

833
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:00,560
I know.

834
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:01,920
I know.

835
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:02,340
I told you.

836
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:02,620
I told.

837
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,580
You said you weren't an FPS player.

838
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,720
I just, you know.

839
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,540
I learned from the best.

840
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,040
Me.

841
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:23,740
Obviously.

842
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:26,900
Nice shooting.

843
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,420
Three hits, says Mendeleev.

844
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,400
Here's your prize.

845
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:32,120
You got the Supertime Funbow TM.

846
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,940
We don't sell ammo, so you'll have to find your own arrows
for it.

847
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,920
Now we can go kill that guy.

848
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,220
Wait, right, wait.

849
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,180
Ooh, oh, we see it?

850
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:47,760
We have an arrow.

851
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,320
Boy, you sure know how to pick them.

852
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,300
This arrow's kind of pointy even.

853
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,480
This is a pretty fancy bow.

854
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,180
You're surprised those shady archers give away such decent
prizes.

855
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,380
You have expected goldfish in a bag.

856
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,100
Let's go.

857
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:08,940
Steel arrows.

858
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:09,920
Wait, you can do that?

859
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,300
Hold on.

860
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,560
I gotta save real quick.

861
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,940
I can't stop coughing today.

862
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:18,640
I'm so sorry.

863
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:23,360
Um.

864
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,040
Dead eye ghost girl.

865
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,520
Who's the big boss now?

866
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:29,880
Me!

867
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,340
What do you mean?

868
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,860
Steel arrow.

869
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,480
Oh, steel arrow.

870
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:38,880
Yeah.

871
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,320
Oh, no, they're still watching me.

872
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,020
Pollen?

873
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,160
I think it is pollen.

874
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,880
I think I have a bad allergy.

875
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,660
Coughing tuscaru.

876
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,260
Now...

877
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:53,840
Hi, Tech.

878
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:54,840
Welcome to membership.

879
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:55,800
Thank you!

880
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,600
Let's take some arrows here, I guess.

881
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,240
Do I need any more?

882
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,300
I think I can one-shot him.

883
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:03,600
Take Arrow.

884
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,480
You're pretty much all set on the arrow front.

885
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,800
They are kind of cool, though.

886
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,900
We're confident, you guys.

887
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,100
Have confidence.

888
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,920
Have confidence.

889
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:14,960
We're gonna kill this guy.

890
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,400
We're gonna kill him dead.

891
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,320
Shoot Arrow.

892
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,740
Here goes nothing, kid Icarus.

893
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:25,900
Whoa!

894
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:26,560
Whoa!

895
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,580
Erode.

896
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,000
Nice shot.

897
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,940
You smote to the Carrick.

898
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,920
He lay there stinking.

899
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,060
Just like my cat.

900
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:41,280
Oh!

901
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:46,540
A light rain heralds the washing free of the Carrick's grip
on the land.

902
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,640
You're feeling pretty good, though.

903
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,380
So the artless symbolism doesn't bug you.

904
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,100
I'm going to take my arrow back.

905
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,140
Take arrow.

906
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,220
Ew, no way.

907
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,810
That thing's got some serious Carrick brand cooties on it
now.

908
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,020
Not the cooties.

909
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:08,940
Terrible day for rain.

910
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,200
Cry for Carrick.

911
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,800
What's his name?

912
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:13,940
Carrick.

913
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,080
Carrick.

914
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:17,840
Look.

915
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,000
There are large hoof prints in the grass here.

916
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,940
There's a large Carrick shaped mound on the grass.

917
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,760
Cry for Carrick.

918
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,790
This guy has no empathy.

919
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:35,980
Take his belt.

920
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:37,420
Strip.

921
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,860
Take everything.

922
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,020
Steal.

923
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,440
Rob him.

924
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,260
Loot him.

925
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,380
Take everything he's got.

926
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,480
Rob him for all he's worth.

927
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,200
Steal his fortune.

928
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:10,380
search search carrick I think we have exhausted everything
oh

929
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:23,020
now you've done it you're covered in sticky albeit fine
smelling mud your scalding lake t-shirt is all soiled too

930
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:33,160
you just washed it last harvest what am I supposed to do
looking like looking like I look like, oh my gosh, this is

931
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,380
literally the Bigfoot over here.

932
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,960
Like, I look like Bigfoot right now.

933
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,880
Type cheat.

934
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,240
What happens if I type that?

935
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,440
Cheat.

936
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:51,700
Meh.

937
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,480
I look like Bigfoot over here.

938
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,640
Okay, this guy should now be...

939
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,260
Oh, yes, there is.

940
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:01,760
he is.

941
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:03,240
Talk.

942
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,820
The Carrick is dead, he cries and hops around some more.

943
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,340
You wonder how someone this primitive could have made that
much dough.

944
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:13,380
Um.

945
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,200
Hello?

946
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,180
Talk?

947
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,380
Uh.

948
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:22,990
Take gold.

949
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:28,050
The Janka will see you and rip out your jugular with his
teeth or something equally horrible.

950
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:29,370
Hmm.

951
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:30,270
Steel.

952
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:32,490
Steel.

953
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:33,710
Treasure.

954
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:37,680
Wait.

955
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,400
I still, I just, let's go, let's just go get another arrow.

956
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,540
Let's just go get another arrow.

957
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,300
We can solve all of our problems.

958
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,040
Oh.

959
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,120
Take arrow.

960
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,520
You grab yet another arrow from the tree hoping to get some
bonus points.

961
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,580
Okay, let's go kill him.

962
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,340
Let's go kill the jonka.

963
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:16,340
Yeah, we're gonna go kill him.

964
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,440
Shoot.

965
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,460
Shoot jonka.

966
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,680
Shoot bow.

967
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,000
Fire.

968
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,460
Kill jonka.

969
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:34,200
No way, jonkas are born scrappers.

970
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,540
He may be a little, but he'll crawl you.

971
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:38,440
Oh.

972
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,720
Oh, shoot arrow.

973
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,680
The game is not letting me choose violence.

974
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:47,300
Hmm.

975
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,460
So we need to distract him somehow.

976
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:51,440
What do I have?

977
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,680
Uh, oh, the monster mask.

978
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:56,240
Maybe he'll be afraid of me.

979
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,280
Wear mask.

980
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,000
Tell him a joke.

981
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:08,740
Hmm.

982
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:10,620
Hmm.

983
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,320
No violence?

984
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,040
What else can we do?

985
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,860
Wait, I'm kind of stinky now, right?

986
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,940
So maybe the innkeeper will let us in?

987
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,020

Mmm, baby lady.

999
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:27,170
We haven't seen her in a while.

1000
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:30,430
Um.

1001
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:38,190
No, she says the same thing.

1002
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:40,110
This place is dead anyway.

1003
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:41,830
Dang!

1004
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:42,770
Dang!

1005
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:45,850
Is there a muing commit?

1006
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:50,790
Is that actual muing emo?

1007
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:53,370
What?

1008
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:56,030
Oh my god, not the Lorax.

1009
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:58,110
He speaks for the trees.

1010
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,430
Welcome to the Peasantship.

1011
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:09,250
Also,

1012
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:13,420
the hay.

1013
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:15,700
I'm trying to think of what else.

1014
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,280
Okay, so we killed him.

1015
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:19,880
We scared Gary.

1016
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:22,260
There's the hay.

1017
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:22,760
Hey.

1018
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,080
Search.

1019
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:27,900
Hey.

1020
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,120
No needles.

1021
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,620
There's nothing else because we got the fart or the fissure.

1022
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,500
Roll in hay.

1023
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,340
Roll in hay.

1024
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:43,640
No.

1025
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:45,300
Eat.

1026
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,640
I did it again.

1027
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:49,820
Um.

I did it again It means eat happy you guys Eat happy By the
way What are you playing this on?

1029
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,900

1030
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:29,060
I'm on the homestarrunner.com website Actually Find needle
No It's how some people say jump in hay You've not known

1031
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:32,240
much better than a roll in the hay alone.

1032
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:32,800
What?

1033
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:34,860
Wait, that was right!

1034
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,160
You leap in the hay like a two-year-old boy.

1035
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,620
Uh-oh, the hay sticks to your muddy body.

1036
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:44,800
You're a walking hay bale, just like that one guy from that
one show.

1037
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,340
Oh my god!

1038
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,060
I'm just hay!

1039
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,000
Oh, the winds are heavy and all, but a couple of key
screens...

1040
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:00,820
Looks like you're no longer in stealth mode

1041
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:19,720
Okay, okay We got it going to stealth mode Jump in hey Yeah,

Go run?

1051
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:07,880

1052
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,180
Uh, run.

1053
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,140

Okay.

Let me know if you see riches anywhere.

1059
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:20,380
Huh?

1060
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,380
Just a hay.

1061
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,460
He grunts and goes back to his hopping.

1062
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,360
You smooth talker, you.

1063
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:34,660
All right, let's go to the baby lady.

1064
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:36,980
Fooled.

1065
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,580
Oh, no, our mud is gone.

1066
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:42,720
That was so easy.

1067
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,600
We're going to be a peasant in no time, you guys.

1068
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,440
Except we've done 41 things and we don't even stink.

1069
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,740
We don't even anything.

1070
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,960

01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,820
Ooh, it's kind of creepy.

1083
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,960
Hell, the rocking chair is still rocking.

1084

There...

1085
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,400
It reeks of single parrot.

1086
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,140
It's such a...

1087
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:53,640
Savage line.

1088
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,140

01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,580
Stave it.

1093
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:19,840
There is one of those self-rocking chairs.

1094
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,380
Mostly empty shelves.

1095
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:21,920
It's okay.

1096
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,540
Oh, it's a self-rocking chair.

1097
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,700
She was even too...

1098
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:26,980
Boner!

1099
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,320
Thanks for the super chat.

01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,360
Baby acquired.

1101
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,580
Now we're playing peasant stranding.

1102
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,560
Wait, why can't I move?

1103
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,080
Oh, there we go.

1104
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:45,480
I'm gonna go to the lake and throw the baby into the lake
for the gods.

1105
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,500
Oh, here we go.

1106
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,040
Throw baby!

1107
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:56,980
You've already fed the fish.

1108
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:58,140
Let's get moving here, people.

1109
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:58,900
Oh, dang.

1110
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,040
Okay, the other...

1111
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,480
The fish on the other side!

1112
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,020
Throw that baby!

1113
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,640
Throw that baby!

1114
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,280
Throw that baby!

1115
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,840
Throw that baby!

1116
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,480
Throw that baby!

1117
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,140
Throw baby!

1118
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,720
again from the center of the lake.

1119
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:17,320
Looks deeper there.

1120
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:19,560
Throw that baby.

1121
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,240
Throw that baby.

1122
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:22,860

1123
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,200
Oh, throw baby.

1124
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,220
Oh, throw baby.

1125
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,000
Hmm, maybe try someplace else.

1126
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:31,840
Throw that baby.

1127
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,420
I accidentally clipped into their table for a second.

1128
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,500
Throw baby.

1129
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:40,640
Hmm.

1130
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,620
Where else can we throw the baby?

1131
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:43,540

Throw that baby.

1137
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,600
Wait, how do I get to the center of the lake?

1138
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:29,990
I forgot about this guy!

1139
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:33,490

1140
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,310
You're on the right track, Mint.

1141
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:55,330

The pressure was too hard on you.

1173
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:55,170
Normal plant.

1174
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:55,850

01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:05,270
Mead is a type of alcohol made with fermented honey.

1180
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:08,510
How can you ferment honey?

1181
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,490
Open.

1182
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:12,850
A search drawer.

Look!

1185
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:20,890
This place could use some serious sprucing of the up
variety.

1186
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:25,830
There's a dresser over there and a broom kind of silhouetted
all mysterious like.

1187
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:31,190

There's a vintage peasant robe in there!

1194
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:50,870
Just like grandpa used to wear.

We're a peasant!

1201
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:36,910
Let's go to the inn!

1202
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:40,190
Let's go to the inn.

1203
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,930

Boop, boop.

1206
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:49,770
We're gonna catch ourselves on fire eventually.

1207
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:51,430
Back to the inn.

1208
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:52,110
Boop, boop, boop.

1209
01:19:56,350 --> 01:19:59,810
We have to catch ourselves on fire here, I'm assuming,
right?

1210
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:03,430
Hello, sir.

1211
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,050
Get a room.

1212
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:08,830
Okay, youngster, says the decrepit old person.

1213
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:13,550
Just bed on down for the night, and I'm sure I'll remember
to collect the fee come morning.

1214
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:15,850
Good night, everybody.

1215
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:25,090
A night falls like a bad PowerPoint presentation.

1216
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:27,030
Welcome to Mambusha.

1217
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:28,070
Thank you!

1218
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:29,690
Whoa,

01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:33,070
it's night.

1220
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:34,730
What an uncomfortable bed.

1221
01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:39,270
You sleep for maybe 20 minutes before the extreme pain and
your spine forces you to get up.

1222
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,550
He left the pantry open.

1223
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:43,870
What can we take?

1224
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:45,850
Take candle.

1225
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:49,010
Seems like you should be able to do that, doesn't it?

1226
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:50,770
Sorry, no dice.

1227
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,230
A small hint of brilliance.

1228
01:20:56,030 --> 01:21:10,370
but she can wear clothes right she can still be a peasant
because it's not her on fire but the robe yeah so true the

1234
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:01,870
You reach way up to the top shelf.

1235
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:06,590

about who's hotter as Mendeleev okay I can I can settle
this.

1276
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:09,610
Well, I can see that Dengalev has a very pronounced chin.

1277
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:13,490
That's already the signs of a Chad.

1278
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:17,290
And he also speaks with confidence.

1279
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:21,790
Where Mendeleev is, you know, he's just kind of Eeyore.

1280
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:23,950
He's like, I'm so king.

1281
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:25,510
side.

1282
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:27,970
Mendeleev is hotter for sure.

01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:28,590

Well, I mean, I don't like you much anyway.

Because I'm on fire, you're discriminating against me.

1363
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:55,730
It's a pre-existing condition.

1364
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:58,070
You can't do this to me.

1365
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:00,650

1388
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:25,160
And I was wondering if you could teach me to be as awesome
as you.

1389
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:25,940
Ah!

1390
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:27,740
Sorry, you scared me.

1391
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:29,720
I am a vampire and...

1392
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:31,080
Huh?

1393
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:35,360
And what?

1394
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:38,320

Thank you!

01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:41,760
What do I do?

1397
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:42,400
What do I...

1398
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,520
Maybe I hide behind...

1399
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,780
Hide behind tree.

1400
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:48,880
I'm just gonna say hide.

1401
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:51,740
Hide.

1402
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,120
Um...

1403
01:33:58,120 --> 01:33:58,640
Hide.

1404
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,640
Can you whisper?

1405
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:03,580
Whisper.

1406
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:05,780
Hmm...

1407
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:06,680

1408
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:07,960

Check my inventory.

1411
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:22,810
I feel like the hay would have been a good thing here.

1412
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,760
Take off shirt.

1413
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:32,520
No.

1414
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:38,860
This guy needs my shirt.

1415
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,980
His nipples are so prominent.

1416
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:41,940
Look at them.

1417
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:43,480
Look at them.

1418
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:45,720
I thought they were eyeballs at first.

1419
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,180
Maybe this is not a human.

1420
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,280
Maybe this is actually a creature.

1421
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:52,460
These are his eyes.

1422
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,720
And this is like a...

1423
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,380
A cyst or something.

1424
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:00,220
You know?

1425
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:05,760
What do you mean another Mipple Hater?

1426
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,180
I'm not hating.

1427
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:08,180
I'm just saying.

1428
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:11,620
Wear.

1429
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,100
Mask.

1430
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:14,500
No.

1431
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,820
I can't tell what to do here.

1432
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:24,520
What can, what to do here?

1433
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:26,940
Oh!

1434
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:28,620
He's gone.

1435
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:29,880
We scared him.

1436
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:30,780
What?

1437
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:37,100
There are large hoof prints in the grass here.

1438
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:40,080
Looks like someone left their spare bones here.

1439
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:42,740
Take bones.

1440
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:44,380
No!

1441
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:48,060
No.

1442
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:52,640
Oh, I want the bones.

1443
01:35:54,260 --> 01:35:56,140
I want the bones.

1444
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:58,160
What?

1445
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:05,540
Does anyone actually have a good, like, I was going to say
an actual good idea, but does anyone, like, if you remember

1446
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:06,940
the game, want to give a hint?

1447
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:08,620
I can't remember.

1448
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:12,320
Talk tree.

1449
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:14,440
Talk tree.

1450
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:17,880
Trees can't talk, but a breeze picks up.

1451
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:38,620
And you swear the leaves whisper in the words Naked Ned
Naked Ned Hey Ned Holdo Oh That's totally not Dongolev And

1452
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:46,840

Wavy.

1457
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:35,290
Oh.

1458
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:37,850
Talk to Naked Ned.

1459
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:42,890
Never speak of this meeting, says the nudie and he
disappears.

1460
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:48,560
Huh.

1461
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:55,470
Oh, talk naked Ned gives a different day?

1462
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:03,110
Sure, it doesn't do anything.

1463
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:03,870
Game facts.

1464
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:05,010
What the?

1465
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:07,870
Okay, we'll do talk naked Ned instead of talk to.

1466
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:10,990
Okay, talk naked Ned.

1467
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:12,170
Nope.

1468
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:13,690
Same thing.

1469
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:16,070
Ah, what the?

1470
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:19,150
Maybe I miss something.

1471
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:20,710
Hmm.

1472
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:24,130
Maybe I'll miss something.

1473
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:37,500
He gave us hints for the robe.

1474
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:46,600
useless oh baby had two other tasks oh

1475
01:38:49,940 --> 01:39:10,320

1476
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:15,660
go please insert floppy disk Two, it's a drive B and press
enter.

1477
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:21,180
Snake, you have to change the disc.

1478
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:29,440
There we go.

1479
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:31,620
Let's go.

1480
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:34,860
Climb.

1481
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:42,120
With a new determination, you dig your fingers into the
cliff face and begin to haul yourself up the mountain like

1482
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,700
you were in a sports drink commercial.

1483
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:47,540
The mountain starts rumbling and big loose boulders start to
move.

1484
01:39:47,560 --> 01:40:02,960
tumbling down you'd best avoid them's okay oh oh oh goodness
gracious you cannot go up and also you have to like you

1485
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:13,220
cannot go up and sideways at the same time okay we're just
gonna go this way all right i'm gonna go scoot over a little

1486
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:20,480
maybe here we go everybody we're gonna We're going to go
beat Trogdor!

1487
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:23,400
Oh, nice job climbing the cliff.

1488
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:25,880
You have a real way with those arrow keys.

1489
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,180
What a thrill.

1490
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,720
Oh, you do keep getting more points.

1491
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:34,400
Oh my gosh.

1492
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:35,740
What's this?

1493
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:37,500
Oh, oh.

1494
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:41,260
Foolish peasant, how dare you enter this fairly sacred
chamber?

1495
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,720
You explain that you are here to smote Trogdor.

1496
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:47,540
And if he doesn't get out of your way, him too.

1497
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:50,680
I love coached Z.

1498
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:51,900
Great job.

1499
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:54,560
You cannot vanquish Trogdor.

1500
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:59,620
Only the three keepers of Trogdor hold the tools with which
to destroy the burninator.

1501
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:03,920
The Trog shield, the Trog helmet, and the Trog sword.

1502
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:11,640
And the only way we'll give them up is if you answer the
three Trog trivia questions correctly.

1503
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:17,540
Oh, right here goes, what does Mendeleev have you tell
Dongle.

1504
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:19,580
Hello, everybody?

1505
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:20,620
I mean, not hello.

1506
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:22,460
Everybody?

1507
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:24,280
Let's all say it together.

1508
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:31,800
America ya!

1509
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:38,100
Happy!

1510
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:39,420
No, I'm just kidding.

1511
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,340
It's A.

1512
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,040
Oh, crap.

1513
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:42,400
You're right.

1514
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,840
Here, take this stupid trog shield.

1515
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:48,320
America ya!

1516
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:53,710
Hold, peasant.

1517
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:56,350
You must answer the second dreaded trog trivia.

1518
01:41:56,370 --> 01:42:10,970
question listen careful now what was the innkeeper's pantry
full of I remember not Epson printers old man rub that's

1519
01:42:10,970 --> 01:42:24,830
right oh this sucks because I have to give you this trog
helmet dang and last oh but not least I thought they were

1520
01:42:24,830 --> 01:42:35,550
all going to be color-coded like their fancy dangles here
old man rub think you're pretty hot stuff hey let's see you

1521
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:43,430
answer the deadly and pretty impossible third trog trivial
question riddle me this which way does the river that runs

1522
01:42:43,430 --> 01:42:45,590
through peasantry flow

1523
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:57,370
north east to southwest

1524
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:07,910
I think, wait, I'm thinking of the, um, no, I'm thinking of
the, what's the word?

1525
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:10,970
I'm thinking of the waterfall.

1526
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:17,780
Wait, see you think?

1527
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:19,000
I think it's C, right?

1528
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:21,880
Yeah, maybe I am right.

1529
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:24,940
Pick number C, my lord.

1530
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,060
Pick number C, mint.

1531
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:32,940
Okay, let's try C.

1532
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:37,860
Oh, oh, uh-oh, you got it right.

1533
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,300
Trogdor's gonna kill me.

1534
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,880
Okay, you can have the Trogsword.

1535
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:45,760
Just promise not to kill any Trogdor's with it, okay?

1536
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,020
You just stare at the keeper blankly.

1537
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:51,500
Okay, fine.

1538
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:53,020
You can have the dumb thing anyway.

1539
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:55,980
Trogdor's through the beaded curtain over there.

1540
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,700
The fabled Trogsword is yours.

1541
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:01,600
Now you have the means to strike down Trogdor.

1542
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:03,560
Good luck, peasant.

1543
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:06,640
Yeah!

1544
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:09,660
Look at me!

1545
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:16,240
We are still missing three things!

1546
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:17,180
Oh, four!

1547
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:18,120
Four things!

1548
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:19,560
How curious.

1549
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,320
Let's check out the Trog helmet.

1550
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:24,640
The Trog helmet is not screwing around.

1551
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:26,180
It's a serious helmet.

1552
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:28,980
It also protects against harmful UV rays!

1553
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:33,400
Are you Team Yukari Sensei or Team Namo?

1554
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:34,940
We need to No.

1555
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:36,960
Uh.

1556
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:41,520
As a kid, I was always more Team Yukari Sensei.

1557
01:44:50,630 --> 01:44:52,070
Behold the Trog Shield.

1558
01:44:52,570 --> 01:44:53,790
No, seriously, behold it.

1559
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:56,950
There's no way Trogdor's fire breath can penetrate this
thing.

1560
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:58,170
Yeah.

1561
01:44:58,950 --> 01:45:01,270
The Trog Sword is for real.

1562
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:03,630
Hands down, the coolest item in this whole game.

1563
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:07,890
You can't wait to lop off that beefy arm of Trogdor's with
this guy.

1564
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:09,110
Oh my gosh.

1565
01:45:09,390 --> 01:45:10,170
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1566
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:21,750

is it this is it actually I don't remember what the is there

1567
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:26,650

let's go

1568
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:41,610
my ears the beaded curtain slams shut behind you there's no
turning back no Save?

1569
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:42,370
Oh.

1570
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:46,590
No turning back now, you guys.

1571
01:45:47,730 --> 01:45:48,470
Oh, save.

1572
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:51,510
Be boop.

1573
01:45:51,890 --> 01:45:52,550
Be boop.

1574
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:56,470
Maybe I should have had like a thing before I did the baby,
you know?

1575
01:45:57,110 --> 01:45:57,930
Be boop.

1576
01:45:58,830 --> 01:45:59,990
Oh my god, we're so small!

1577
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:03,730
Throw sword!

1578
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:05,670
This is it!

1579
01:46:06,030 --> 01:46:09,710
You hurl the trog sword with all your might at the sleeping
burninator!

1580
01:46:12,650 --> 01:46:13,150
Oh!

1581
01:46:16,990 --> 01:46:18,250
Wow, it's beefy.

1582
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:19,550
It looks like a cigarette.

1583
01:46:20,470 --> 01:46:22,610
You shouldn't be smoking, Trogdor.

1584
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:23,990
Now you've done it.

1585
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:26,950
Trogdor's awake and the Trogsword doesn't seem to be doing a
whole lot.

1586
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:27,650
Oh, no.

1587
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:30,750
Your legs lock in fear.

1588
01:46:30,850 --> 01:46:35,610
Your eyes glaze over and you wish for some de-peasant...

1589
01:46:35,610 --> 01:46:38,810
de-peasant adult undergarments.

1590
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:42,290
But you think you hear Trogdor whimpering.

1591
01:46:43,970 --> 01:46:44,970
Oh, crap.

1592
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:46,450
That's you whimpering.

1593
01:46:47,070 --> 01:46:48,650
At least your voice still works, I guess.

1594
01:46:51,470 --> 01:46:52,710
Uh, oh, talk.

1595
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:59,110
You scream that your name is rather dashing, and that
Trogdor burninated your cottage, and you're here for

1596
01:46:59,110 --> 01:46:59,790
revenge.

1597
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:09,510
I really appreciate you making the effort to become all the
way up here and thank you, Mr. M.

1598
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:09,890
Hector.

1599
01:47:10,450 --> 01:47:14,350
But I'm kind of indestructible.

1600
01:47:17,710 --> 01:47:18,270
Mortis!

1601
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:23,030
I will say that again for anybody who did not understand.

1602
01:47:23,390 --> 01:47:23,870
Sup, mortal.

1603
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:24,890
Boomstrogdor.

1604
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:30,470
I really appreciate you making all the effort to come all
the way up here and vanquish me and all, but I'm kind of

1605
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:31,090
indestructible.

1606
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:33,850
Yeah, I can't be cute.

1607
01:47:34,190 --> 01:47:38,470
I'm surprised nobody mentioned that to you.

1608
01:47:39,050 --> 01:47:40,330
I let me through.

1609
01:47:47,850 --> 01:48:00,630
terrifying rain of spiders yeah I can't be killed I'm
surprised nobody mentioned that to you I'll admit though

1610
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:07,030
you've gotten farther than anybody else has I bet they'll
make a statue or something in honor of you somewheres

1611
01:48:11,030 --> 01:48:12,950
Rain of Trogdor's.

1612
01:48:15,190 --> 01:48:21,010
I can honestly say it'll be a pleasure and an honor to
burninate you, rather dashing.

1613
01:48:21,590 --> 01:48:25,370
Oh, that sure was nice of him.

1614
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:30,190
And I've been burninated.

1615
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:32,690
You've won!

1616
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:36,690
No one can kill Trogdor, but you came closer than anybody
ever.

1617
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:38,890
Way to go!

1618
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:43,590
No!

1619
01:48:45,130 --> 01:48:48,450
I wanted to 100% it.

1620
01:48:52,810 --> 01:48:54,910
He's eating him.

1621
01:48:55,570 --> 01:48:56,850
Then he's gonna eat me!

1622
01:48:58,330 --> 01:48:59,810
Oh my gosh, it's our statue!

1623
01:49:01,290 --> 01:49:02,990
Nice work on winning and everything.

1624
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:03,930
Oh!

1625
01:49:05,290 --> 01:49:06,910
Scalding Lake!

1626
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:26,650
134 out of 150 is so okay that's it oh it's so frustrating
though ah it's so frustrating not to get 150.

1627
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:44,110
the end yippee what a game look at how rather dashing we are
yeah Here, this statue is in honor of rather dashing.

1628
01:49:44,510 --> 01:49:49,790
I expected him to have a bit more of like a far quad kind of
haircut from his little sprite.

1629
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:52,770
You know, he seemed to have like a bit of a, a bit of a bob.

1630
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:54,630
A bob.

1631
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:55,810
Yeah.

1632
01:49:56,510 --> 01:49:56,830
Hmm.

1633
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,290
How can AAA games compare?

1634
01:50:01,070 --> 01:50:03,270
I think I found my new brain rot.

1635
01:50:06,250 --> 01:50:08,810
I think I found my new brain rot with this.

1636
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:11,750
I'm kind of a fan.

1637
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:16,730
Is this an old game or a new game made retro style?

1638
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:18,370
It's pretty old.

1639
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:20,430
It's pretty old.

1640
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:24,490
It's not like as old as it seems though.

1641
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:28,150
It's like mid-2000s game.

1642
01:50:29,730 --> 01:50:29,990
Right?

1643
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:32,950
Right?

1644
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:37,750
Circa 2004.

1645
01:50:38,990 --> 01:50:39,470
That's what I meant.

1646
01:50:40,450 --> 01:50:58,110
2010 right wait 2000 to 2010 so 2004 is almost in the middle
so 20 years yeah yeah 20 20 years old this game is but it

1647
01:50:58,110 --> 01:51:08,190
seems like it's supposed to be like 40 years old you know
it's an old parody of an even older genre exactly oh my gosh

1648
01:51:08,190 --> 01:51:13,550
tractor Thank you for the trip down memory lane track.

1649
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:15,830
Thank you.

1650
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:19,050
Yeah.

1651
01:51:22,110 --> 01:51:30,730
Sorry, when I say not too old, I mean compared to the style
of game that it's emulating or that it's parodying.

1652
01:51:30,930 --> 01:51:31,870
You know what I mean?

1653
01:51:35,130 --> 01:51:37,930
It's not from the 80s or 90s or anything.

1654
01:51:40,410 --> 01:51:40,930
explode.

1655
01:51:42,330 --> 01:51:43,210
Yeah, that was so fun.

1656
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:44,430
What a trip down memory lane.

1657
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:52,350
I almost want to speedrun it to try and get the baby extra
stuff, but I'm kind of tired.

1658
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:54,990
I'll be honest.

1659
01:51:56,610 --> 01:52:01,690
Today and yesterday were a couple of busy days with me
haunting all over the place.

1660
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:05,630
Yeah, Spider-Man.

1661
01:52:07,130 --> 01:52:07,790
Oh, sorry.

1662
01:52:09,010 --> 01:52:22,370

1664
01:52:33,410 --> 01:52:39,930
without a bonnet has to find the bill key to pen blue door

1665
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:46,470
Oh my gosh, that's the yokel felon king I know and remember.

1666
01:52:49,710 --> 01:52:56,590
It's crazy how back then they just copied how old DOS games
and nowadays we get styles copying the PS1 wobble.

1667
01:52:56,810 --> 01:52:57,590
What a time we live in.

1668
01:52:57,790 --> 01:52:58,570
I know, right?

1669
01:52:58,810 --> 01:52:59,530
So funny.

1670
01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:04,150
Though there are some games that copy styles like this too
sometimes.

1671
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:07,450
You know, indie game Dave the Diver.

1672
01:53:07,690 --> 01:53:08,230
No, I'm just kidding.

01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,460
I'm glad that there's a Peasants Quest movie!

1680
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:15,040
Wait, actually?

1681
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:16,980
Hold on, I'm looking it up.

1682
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:20,400
Peasants Quest movie.

1683
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:28,220
Also, don't Google Peasants Quest because there's apparently
another game called Peasants Quest that does not.

1684
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:31,120
Hmm.

1685
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:35,500
It, uh...

1686
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:41,110
It does not look friendly.

1687
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:42,770
Hold on.

1688
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:44,110
Oh, movie trailer.

1689
01:54:45,150 --> 01:54:45,890
It began.

1690
01:54:47,230 --> 01:54:51,150
Oh, I think we can watch this.

1691
01:54:52,630 --> 01:54:53,830
It's, hold on.

1692
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:55,370
Give me a second.

1693
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:58,610
How can I do this real quick?

1694
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:04,070
I'm going to hide the peasant's quest.

1695
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:07,290
I'm going to do this.

1696
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:10,790
Wait, can I put it here?

1697
01:55:10,890 --> 01:55:11,150
Oh, no.

1698
01:55:11,170 --> 01:55:11,590
I can't.

1699
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:12,790
Here we go.

1700
01:55:14,770 --> 01:55:16,450
The Peasant's Quest.

1701
01:55:19,070 --> 01:55:21,170
And then I can scoot it over.

1702
01:55:23,690 --> 01:55:24,730
Like that.

1703
01:55:25,650 --> 01:55:25,970
Okay.

1704
01:55:26,370 --> 01:55:27,010
We're watching.

1705
01:55:27,130 --> 01:55:28,770
We're going to watch ye old YouTube.

1706
01:55:30,710 --> 01:55:33,370
We're watching ye old YouTube, everybody.

1707
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:34,830
Oh, it's a little cut off.

1708
01:55:35,090 --> 01:55:35,350
Hold on.

1709
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:38,850
Turn it down some too.

1710
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:41,150
I hope I don't get copyright struck like before.

1711
01:55:41,170 --> 01:55:43,430
There we go.

1712
01:55:50,270 --> 01:55:51,110
Okay.

1713
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:58,430
It began as the best-selling video computer TV game of all
time.

1714
01:55:59,810 --> 01:56:01,410
But not really.

1715
01:56:02,370 --> 01:56:03,030
But still.

1716
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:06,570
A simple peasant wearing short pants.

1717
01:56:06,570 --> 01:56:07,010
I was him.

1718
01:56:07,090 --> 01:56:07,570
I was him.

1719
01:56:07,570 --> 01:56:16,910
way into the heart of a nation now for his greatest
adventure yet he will quest into theaters oh see that's what

1720
01:56:16,910 --> 01:56:31,950
I imagined him to look like where's my cottage oh no I got
oh my god whoa whoa who's he fighting I don't remember that

1721
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:39,230
part it's not with the baby we have coexisted with the bird
of nature Who is that?

1722
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:45,570
This is from 14 years ago, you guys.

1723
01:56:47,450 --> 01:56:49,730
Oh, he's got his golden leg.

1724
01:56:53,410 --> 01:56:57,730
From the sort of people who brought you Trogdor and
Litigation Jackson.

1725
01:56:57,990 --> 01:56:58,830
Is that a real horse?

1726
01:56:58,930 --> 01:56:59,470
Easy now, Gary.

1727
01:56:59,910 --> 01:57:02,710
I'm just going to wear a mask.

1728
01:57:04,270 --> 01:57:05,070
Is that a real horse?

1729
01:57:05,270 --> 01:57:07,310
Show me your real man, rather dashing.

1730
01:57:09,250 --> 01:57:10,530
Through baby!

1731
01:57:10,750 --> 01:57:11,910
Through baby!

1732
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:14,390
How do you?

1733
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:15,270
How do you?

1734
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:15,790
I'm Mendelov.

1735
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:16,830
I'm Donglev.

1736
01:57:18,190 --> 01:57:18,430
Ah!

1737
01:57:18,930 --> 01:57:19,930
Rather dashing.

1738
01:57:21,170 --> 01:57:23,610
More like rather homely.

1739
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:25,990
Whoa!

1740
01:57:26,690 --> 01:57:27,590
High dog!

1741
01:57:28,230 --> 01:57:31,190
A trog venture for the whole trog family!

1742
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:33,690
Oh, they said they don't do lessons.

1743
01:57:34,530 --> 01:57:35,710
They just hate me, I guess.

1744
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:37,550
Oh, I love Blue.

1745
01:57:37,570 --> 01:57:38,130
for night.

1746
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:42,310
I'm just so mad at Trogdor.

1747
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:45,170
Access to Trogdor is strictly for peasants.

1748
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:45,950
Oh, yep.

1749
01:57:46,850 --> 01:57:48,470
Why is it wiggling down here?

1750
01:57:49,070 --> 01:57:50,610
You don't smell like a peasant.

1751
01:57:51,550 --> 01:57:52,190
Ah!

1752
01:57:52,830 --> 01:57:53,770
Oh my god!

1753
01:57:54,670 --> 01:57:55,850
I killed that guy!

1754
01:57:57,230 --> 01:57:57,870

It's spoilers.

1757
01:58:02,570 --> 01:58:04,390

1758
01:58:05,170 --> 01:58:06,410

The maid is grounded.

1769
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:25,210

that made homestar probably had a lot of fun you know they

1773
01:59:55,850 --> 01:59:56,870

1774
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:58,550
I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick.

1775
01:59:58,810 --> 02:00:00,490

1788
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:51,520
I went and I saw my cat and he was laying on his back and
looked really cute so I went on his tummy.

1789
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:58,740
And then I kind of kissed him and I said, who's a healthy
boy?

1806
02:06:45,790 --> 02:06:47,950
Fine point click drawing.

1807
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:49,930
Rubber grip.

1808
02:06:57,770 --> 02:06:58,970
0.5.

02:07:00,330 --> 02:07:01,810
0.5.7.

1810
02:07:04,210 --> 02:07:05,850
Rubber grip hits hard.

1811
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:08,730
It's a first draft.

1812
02:07:08,890 --> 02:07:10,150
I think it's perfect the way it is.

1813
02:07:11,730 --> 02:07:14,050
It's okay, but it's not your best work, boss.

1814
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:18,630
Wow, we have some real criticizers in the chat.

1815
02:07:20,010 --> 02:07:21,010
It's okay, I get it.

1816
02:07:21,370 --> 02:07:21,870
I get it.

1817
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:24,550
What if I go to Homestar Runner today?

1818
02:07:25,470 --> 02:07:26,090
Their website?

1819
02:07:26,410 --> 02:07:28,930
Wait, the main website is like...

1820
02:07:28,930 --> 02:07:30,250
Oh, come on in.

1821
02:07:31,130 --> 02:07:32,810
Wait, can I actually... What is Ruffle?

1822
02:07:36,110 --> 02:07:38,930
Oh, at the bottom it says, what's this big play button, you
ask?

1823
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:40,570
Well, Flash is all kinds of dead.

1824
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:43,630
but the amazing ruffle project helps our cartoons live on.

1825
02:07:44,110 --> 02:07:49,650
Not every cartoon in game works perfectly just yet, so be
patient and expect some jankiness here and there while we

1826
02:07:49,650 --> 02:07:50,470
keep working.

1827
02:07:50,950 --> 02:07:52,090
That's so cute!

1828
02:07:53,870 --> 02:07:55,730
Tough crowd, for real.

1829
02:07:57,630 --> 02:08:01,130
It's not easy making chance up, we've got a good knack for
it.

1830
02:08:01,710 --> 02:08:02,270
Thanks!

1831
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:04,570
Wait.

1832
02:08:06,590 --> 02:08:07,830
Hold on real quick.

1833
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:10,050
Hold on real quick.

1834
02:08:10,930 --> 02:08:13,210
I want to make sure I say the right thing.

1835
02:08:15,870 --> 02:08:16,530
Hold on.

1836
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:18,490
One second.

1837
02:08:20,910 --> 02:08:25,030
Will you ever be playing the Danger-esque Point and Click
game also on the Homestar Runner website?

1838
02:08:25,570 --> 02:08:26,110
I don't know.

1839
02:08:26,590 --> 02:08:29,550
I don't remember playing.

1840
02:08:29,870 --> 02:08:32,870
This one I played because I played it a lot as a kid too.

1841
02:08:36,510 --> 02:08:38,890
But I don't really remember.

1842
02:08:41,310 --> 02:08:49,410
the other ones so I don't know if they work either like they
said not all their games work but

1843
02:08:52,770 --> 02:08:54,990
my heart felt that chat

1844
02:09:02,410 --> 02:09:09,370
did you beat it back then I don't remember beating it
because I didn't I feel like I feel like Trogdor's voice

1845
02:09:09,370 --> 02:09:25,900
would have traumatized me as a kid and I don't remember that
i don't remember that at all i was like but i probably would

1846
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:35,680
have remembered that right i don't know i don't know

1847
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:51,840
oh i'm so sleepy you guys i've i yesterday i worked i did a
ton essentially I like had a I made a um what's the word I

1848
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:58,680
made like a big calendar for Matara and I to work on um
future podcast episodes and scheduling them out and

1849
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:08,560
scheduling some trips and scheduling some other events and
scheduling things like that and uh um so I worked on a bunch

1850
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:14,280
of that I worked on messaging some people for commissions on
things

1851
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:19,960
Oh, nice.

1852
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:22,620
Yeah, I was so organized.

1853
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:25,560
She loves to schedule.

1854
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:31,040
Yeah.

1855
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:34,620
We have things we're cooking.

1856
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:42,180
I'm so glad you're indie.

1857
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:48,220
I mean.

1858
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:51,380
I guess it is, I guess there is more freedom with it, right?

1859
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:53,800
So, did you message Henya?

1860
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:55,200
I messaged her!

1861
02:10:56,380 --> 02:11:11,340
I said, I said, I said, I said to her, I said, I first, she,
she sent me a waving emoji, emoji, and I sent a waving

1862
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:18,840
emoji, and she said, hi, people, people, shy, and I said,
hi, I'm a big fan of you, Dayo.

1863
02:11:30,420 --> 02:11:32,800
I said, I'm a big fan of you, Dayo.

1864
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:39,320
Is it P-Po-Shai?

1865
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:40,300
I don't know, actually.

1866
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:41,460
What's a P-P-Po?

1867
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:44,080
I don't know which ones they are.

1868
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:44,880
Hold on.

1869
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:47,480
P-Po-Shai.

1870
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:50,000
Yeah, she said the P-Po-Shai.

1871
02:11:58,780 --> 02:11:59,560
This one.

1872
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:01,240
Hold on.

1873
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:03,480
It's literally me.

1874
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:08,660
Me, people shy.

1875
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,540
Yep, gotta hit her with the...

1876
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:20,440
I don't know.

1877
02:12:20,740 --> 02:12:22,160
Can I stick out my tongue to her?

1878
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:23,660
Would that be considered weird?

1879
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:25,580
Or...

1880
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:26,280
I don't know.

1881
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:28,340
What if I...

1882
02:12:28,780 --> 02:12:30,960
What if I just always talk with my tongue out?

1883
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:34,440
What if I always talk with my tongue out?

1884
02:12:34,660 --> 02:12:35,420
And I...

1885
02:12:37,540 --> 02:12:40,200
Wait, what a stream like this all the time?

1886
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:41,160
What do you think?

1887
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:50,700
We're gonna, but if you keep watching, it's like, it makes
the stream like this.

1888
02:12:58,790 --> 02:13:04,710
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to stream and like turn
it out of town.

1889
02:13:07,670 --> 02:13:09,910
It's a sign of intimidation.

1890
02:13:21,090 --> 02:13:43,830
sticking out your tongue for the no no they're not pants
it's in my tongue wish I got to experience the early

1891
02:13:43,830 --> 02:13:44,970
internet some more.

1892
02:13:45,710 --> 02:13:45,930
No.

1893
02:13:46,930 --> 02:13:48,870
I think the early internet...

1894
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:52,070
I don't even know.

1895
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:54,230
There's definitely some weird stuff going on.

1896
02:13:54,230 --> 02:13:56,190
I mean, there's always weird stuff, right?

1897
02:13:57,230 --> 02:13:57,750
But...

1898
02:13:57,750 --> 02:14:01,010
Home Star Runner was very pure, which is the best part about
it.

1899
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:02,710
People...

1900
02:14:02,710 --> 02:14:03,870
Oh, Pepe and his son...

1901
02:14:07,450 --> 02:14:07,970
Pepe?

1902
02:14:08,170 --> 02:14:09,270
Is Pepe's son?

1903
02:14:11,190 --> 02:14:12,510
Do you guys know that?

1904
02:14:12,570 --> 02:14:14,350
Like, Pepe is so popular in Japan.

1905
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:22,110
There's a whole section in Village Vanguard for Pepe, Pepe,
Pepe, Pepe.

1906
02:14:24,370 --> 02:14:25,510
For him.

1907
02:14:27,510 --> 02:14:29,910
Look, they sell, they sell a bunch of merch.

1908
02:14:30,290 --> 02:14:30,990
Hold on.

1909
02:14:32,030 --> 02:14:32,870
It's like this.

1910
02:14:33,070 --> 02:14:33,450
Hold on.

1911
02:14:35,710 --> 02:14:36,370
Hold on.

1912
02:14:36,490 --> 02:14:37,230
I got a picture.

1913
02:14:38,890 --> 02:14:39,450
Like this.

1914
02:14:39,950 --> 02:14:40,810
Pepe the frog.

1915
02:14:42,210 --> 02:14:43,390
Pepe's a frog.

1916
02:14:46,950 --> 02:14:48,670
What is a Pepe the frog?

1917
02:14:50,770 --> 02:14:52,430
Who is Pepe the frog?

1918
02:14:56,090 --> 02:14:57,010
Demonic normals!

1919
02:14:57,130 --> 02:14:57,930
Thank you so much for that!

1920

02:15:13,950 --> 02:15:14,410
Ghost...

1929
02:15:14,430 --> 02:15:19,950

tongue?

1930
02:15:22,030 --> 02:15:25,670

I'm assuming that's what you meant.

1938
02:15:55,170 --> 02:15:57,710
I sure hope so.

1939
02:16:02,070 --> 02:16:04,390
I sure hope so.

1940
02:16:07,270 --> 02:16:10,010
Now lick the candles.

1941
02:16:14,590 --> 02:16:16,330
This was fun, guys.

1942
02:16:17,470 --> 02:16:22,110
Sorry that I feel like this week I don't have so much
planned.

1943
02:16:23,390 --> 02:16:25,130
It's only like my second week back.

1944
02:16:26,190 --> 02:16:32,390
But, um, and I'm already just like, I'm tired.

1945
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:42,890
But, you know, I'm already, but since I kind of came back,
the day after I came back was when we announced the podcast.

1946
02:16:44,430 --> 02:16:52,870
there was a lot of stuff that I needed to take care of and I
was like okay I should probably take care of some of this

1947
02:16:52,870 --> 02:17:07,870
stuff before I before I get too deep into things a little
bit a little so um yeah but it's okay like I just just some

1948
02:17:07,870 --> 02:17:21,790
like housekeeping you know housekeeping hmm hmm you kind of
dropped on us from heaven i know yeah that's what i'm saying

1949
02:17:21,790 --> 02:17:38,210
but i'm still planning lots of stuff and uh yeah um we can
have fun uh with the podcast happening too yippee it's only

1950
02:17:38,210 --> 02:17:46,970
been two weeks i know right it feels like so much longer for
even me but i was okay all right time to make my schedule

1951
02:17:46,970 --> 02:17:54,830
yesterday and then when i was posting it the post that i
made before was like first schedule and i was like first

1952
02:17:54,830 --> 02:18:13,790
schedule what do you mean i'm only making my second schedule
professional mid house keeping yeah yeah podcast is super

1953
02:18:13,790 --> 02:18:23,870
fun i've been loving every episode i think um we well last
night when i was doing the planning i think i decided or

1954
02:18:23,870 --> 02:18:39,250
what rather i decided maybe a good day to end the podcast um
but i still need to talk about it with matara which is

1955
02:18:39,250 --> 02:18:48,570
already so sad to think i don't want to think about it
because yeah even though well the podcast for me also it

1956
02:18:48,570 --> 02:19:00,290
feels different than how do i say like for me like obviously
it's different than normal streaming but like it's weird

1957
02:19:00,290 --> 02:19:10,230
because when i stream i don't know i feel like maybe half of
my brain is turned off when i stream but with the podcast i

1958
02:19:10,230 --> 02:19:19,990
feel like my brain has to be like totally on hear me out
what if you don't end it no we gotta end it's you know it's

1959
02:19:19,990 --> 02:19:26,650
a summer podcast you guys it's a summer podcast

1960
02:19:29,950 --> 02:19:40,270
but that's okay you'll have you'll have um you'll have lots
of lots and lots of more episodes so um stream nerve but

1961
02:19:40,270 --> 02:19:47,710
yeah since my brain is like on for like a hundred percent or
what at least it feels like it's supposed to be a hundred

1962
02:19:47,710 --> 02:19:54,090
percent um during it like it it actually does kind of like
wear me out a little bit more which i didn't expect i was

1963
02:19:54,090 --> 02:20:03,670
like oh my gosh it's just talking for like a couple hours
like no biggie but um maybe i'm just because you know uh

1964
02:20:03,670 --> 02:20:14,890
it's been so long since i've streamed i have no stamina
anymore i have no stamina anymore will you still collab with

1965
02:20:14,890 --> 02:20:15,930
In the future with Matara?

1966
02:20:16,150 --> 02:20:17,350
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1967
02:20:21,490 --> 02:20:24,530
So, podcast turns into collab.

1968
02:20:26,430 --> 02:20:26,810
Hey.

1969
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:31,250
Y'all are very, on very high grade YAP mode.

1970
02:20:32,930 --> 02:20:35,790
It's got to end someday so that we get the fall and winter
Matara.

1971
02:20:35,910 --> 02:20:37,070
Mintara podcast?

1972
02:20:37,570 --> 02:20:37,890
No!

1973
02:20:43,350 --> 02:20:44,870
But, but I think...

1974
02:20:45,410 --> 02:20:51,470
because i'm just like oh my gosh this is like kind of
wearing me out maybe also because like matara is such an

1975
02:20:51,470 --> 02:20:59,010
extrovert and for me like when i talk to you guys like i
still can feel like i'm an introvert because i just see you

1976
02:20:59,010 --> 02:21:12,910
guys's text but with her i have to have an actual
conversation so my battery just goes so quickly it's

1977
02:21:12,910 --> 02:21:19,930
something that i've like kind of been like self-aware of
with the podcast i'm like oh my gosh by the end i start to

1978
02:21:19,930 --> 02:21:32,950
like i feel like i start to get kind of tired i need to i
need to work on that for future episodes so i want to say

1979
02:21:32,950 --> 02:21:38,850
lately i've been um trying collecting more ace combat merch
although the shipping is kind of expensive because they're

1980
02:21:38,850 --> 02:21:48,730
mostly in japan shipping from japan is so expensive but good
luck podcast in winter because it's summer down south that's

1981
02:21:48,730 --> 02:21:51,430
true that's true

1982
02:21:58,770 --> 02:22:06,030
yeah but it's not that i um i'm still definitely of course
having fun with it it's just a different experience for me

1983
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:13,110
something that i didn't expect because i thought it would be
so easy but not that i'm complaining or anything oh my gosh

1984
02:22:13,110 --> 02:22:21,950
being a content creator is so difficult you'll just you
peasants you just never understand now go go and destroy

1985
02:22:21,950 --> 02:22:22,700
truck door

1986
02:22:27,370 --> 02:22:30,030
yeah special aussie episode

1987
02:22:33,790 --> 02:22:45,070
socially battery depleted my battery maybe that's what's
making me so tired all the time no i had a bad dream last

1988
02:22:45,070 --> 02:22:55,890
night oh my gosh oh I think it's because I fell asleep
listening to listening to like one of those ghost hunting

1989
02:22:55,890 --> 02:23:06,070
YouTube channels or whatever there's this one that I there's
like I love the ones that are so dramatic about everything

1990
02:23:06,070 --> 02:23:13,970
because it just is so funny where first of all it's just
like oh my gosh you're doing that to a ghost Like, a ghost

1991
02:23:13,970 --> 02:23:16,610
is never going to respond to that, you know?

1992
02:23:21,430 --> 02:23:22,230
But, um...

1993
02:23:22,230 --> 02:23:26,370
But, uh, you know, as a ghost, of course, I would know.

1994
02:23:27,670 --> 02:23:29,510
But, yeah, they're always so goofy.

1995
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:31,150
They're just like...

1996
02:23:32,630 --> 02:23:33,750
Yeah, I don't know.

1997
02:23:36,230 --> 02:23:38,130
What's the one that I... What is their name?

1998
02:23:40,270 --> 02:23:41,710
They had a TV show.

1999
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:59,980
I saw Metal Gear Facts to Fall Asleep 2 video I was going to
try tonight You should I have a person For the past couple

02:25:12,250 --> 02:25:22,870
are you a shaniac or a bugara i'm a shaniac all the way even
though Even though I'm a ghost and I appreciate that.

2008
02:25:23,630 --> 02:25:24,070
That.

2009
02:25:24,730 --> 02:25:25,430
Oh gosh.

2010
02:25:26,070 --> 02:25:26,510
What's that?

2011
02:25:26,510 --> 02:25:29,590
That Ryan believes in ghosts and Shane doesn't believe in
me.

2012
02:25:29,690 --> 02:25:30,270
And that's okay.

2013
02:25:30,970 --> 02:25:31,230
You know.

2014
02:25:31,390 --> 02:25:32,090
It's not like if someone.

2015
02:25:32,390 --> 02:25:32,610
You know.

2016
02:25:33,370 --> 02:25:34,850
If someone doesn't believe in me.

2017
02:25:34,950 --> 02:25:36,890
It's not like I'm going to die again.

2018
02:25:37,050 --> 02:25:37,170
You know.

2019
02:25:37,190 --> 02:25:38,510
Or cease to exist.

2020
02:25:38,810 --> 02:25:40,630
I'm not like other creatures.

2021
02:25:40,850 --> 02:25:41,270
Where like.

2022
02:25:41,330 --> 02:25:42,670
If someone doesn't believe in you.

2023
02:25:42,910 --> 02:25:45,350
Like they like fade out of existence.

2024
02:25:45,510 --> 02:25:46,030
You know what I mean.

2025
02:25:46,430 --> 02:25:46,630
But.

2026
02:25:47,670 --> 02:25:49,090
So for me it doesn't matter.

2027
02:25:49,650 --> 02:25:53,730
If Shane doesn't believe in ghosts, I just think he's funny.

2028
02:25:54,730 --> 02:25:55,950
Go team Shaneiac.

2029
02:25:56,170 --> 02:25:57,130

What?

2039
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:24,740

adopt a better a better policy about your existence you know

Get wrecked chat.

2052
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:29,580
Also, you don't need wings to fly as a ghost.

2053
02:27:30,980 --> 02:27:36,220
Speaking of, well it's not flying, it's more like floating,
but I got a new desk.

2054
02:27:36,460 --> 02:27:38,440
I got a standing desk.

2055
02:27:39,140 --> 02:27:41,780
But I've been calling it a floating desk.

2056
02:27:43,360 --> 02:27:46,060
I got a floating desk for myself.

2057
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:49,680
Oh my gosh, I'm going to be so healthy.

2058
02:27:51,080 --> 02:27:52,900
So you're saying you could beat up a ferry.

2059
02:27:53,180 --> 02:27:53,700
Yeah, probably.

2060
02:27:55,060 --> 02:27:55,600
Why not?

2061
02:28:00,940 --> 02:28:01,420
Yeah.

2062
02:28:02,060 --> 02:28:03,560
I've been trying to.

2063
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:12,600
Because because um can I mention this you know what she
mentions things all the time it's probably fine if I mention

2064
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:19,460
this actually I think it was already mentioned before so
because I know that Matara is wanting to come visit yeah we

2065
02:28:19,460 --> 02:28:24,980
mentioned it because we talked I asked if she wanted to play
my patchy slot machine because Matara is planning on

2066
02:28:24,980 --> 02:28:34,140
visiting me I'm like been reorganizing the maid's cafe a
little bit I was just like like oh gosh maybe this doesn't

2067
02:28:34,140 --> 02:28:39,060

just a little just a little bit

2068
02:28:43,460 --> 02:28:51,240

this week but also i've been cleaning and reorganizing for

2069
02:28:51,240 --> 02:29:04,340
another reason good day mint good day first thing you need
to get to go with your standing desk is a tall chair It's

2070
02:29:04,340 --> 02:29:05,280

2071
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:08,020

You're bigger than Elvis.

Ace Combat fans don't want to demand you to play them if you

2164
02:36:26,840 --> 02:36:27,420
don't want to.

2165
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:31,980
Don't worry, don't worry.

2180
02:37:23,080 --> 02:37:25,040

No, I actually, I just went and saw if, I don't know, things
are not loading properly.

2188
02:37:58,550 --> 02:37:59,790
YouTube is being very slow.

2189
02:38:00,330 --> 02:38:02,790
And I'm seeing it's happening on other channels too, so...

2190
02:38:02,810 --> 02:38:04,130
You know what?

2191
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:05,490
It's fine.

2192
02:38:06,870 --> 02:38:10,610
Small indie company for small indie VTuber.

Oh, gosh, it's so frustrating.

2196
02:38:16,850 --> 02:38:17,850
Can't see anything.

2197
02:38:18,810 --> 02:38:20,270
Time war back to 2020.

2198
02:38:22,090 --> 02:38:23,190
Oh, YouTube.

2199
02:38:24,350 --> 02:38:24,950

2200
02:38:27,830 --> 02:38:29,990
Hold on, I can't reach it anymore.

2201
02:38:39,930 --> 02:38:41,130
I'm sorry.

2202
02:38:41,890 --> 02:38:47,750
I just opened up that back end of YouTube and I got a
comment that was like, WTF, why do you sing so well?

2203
02:38:48,530 --> 02:38:49,310
I don't know.

2204
02:38:50,750 --> 02:38:51,090
Why?

2205
02:38:53,510 --> 02:38:54,110
WTF.

2206
02:38:58,590 --> 02:38:59,590
Well, guys.

2207
02:39:00,150 --> 02:39:02,630
Oh, oh, chat is just like old times.

2208
02:39:03,990 --> 02:39:04,350
WTF.

2209
02:39:05,330 --> 02:39:06,430
YouTuber, why?

2210
02:39:06,910 --> 02:39:08,810
Why do you sing so well, YouTuber?

2211
02:39:09,410 --> 02:39:09,590
Huh?

2212
02:39:10,410 --> 02:39:15,350
Why do you have a voice on YouTube, YouTuber?

2213
02:39:16,330 --> 02:39:17,490
Um, I can't sing.

2214
02:39:17,610 --> 02:39:18,030
Oh my gosh.

2215
02:39:18,550 --> 02:39:20,310
That reminds me of, oh my gosh.

2216
02:39:20,790 --> 02:39:28,410
Okay, so sorry, I was gonna say, I was, I was gonna say
like, why can't I sing as well as you, YouTuber?

2217
02:39:28,830 --> 02:39:31,970
And that reminded me, it was last night.

2218
02:39:33,790 --> 02:39:35,250
No, it was this morning.

2219
02:39:35,330 --> 02:39:43,770
This morning I was, okay, so there was this issue on TikTok
where I don't actually know if it's just a TikTok issue or

2220
02:39:43,770 --> 02:39:49,390
if it's like a general like young people on the internet
issue now.

2221
02:39:51,130 --> 02:39:59,590
But it started on TikTok or rather it blew up on TikTok
where someone made a bean soup, right?

2222
02:39:59,930 --> 02:40:03,010
They were like, okay, here is a recipe for bean soup.

2223
02:40:03,010 --> 02:40:05,030
If you want to have this bean soup.

2224
02:40:06,250 --> 02:40:09,670
And they were getting comments like, well, what if I don't
like beans?

2225
02:40:12,330 --> 02:40:12,810
Okay.

2226
02:40:13,630 --> 02:40:14,770
Don't make the bean soup.

2227
02:40:17,010 --> 02:40:19,850
And they were like, what if I can't have that ingredient?

2228
02:40:21,210 --> 02:40:21,690
Okay.

2229
02:40:22,570 --> 02:40:24,730
Just don't add it then.

2230
02:40:25,050 --> 02:40:25,330
You know?

2231
02:40:26,730 --> 02:40:27,690
Like just...

2232
02:40:27,690 --> 02:40:32,990
Like there was this weird thing where like people are like
starting to...

2233
02:40:33,010 --> 02:40:40,070
watch videos and that's this is why I think it's like
younger like younger audiences because they'll be like

2234
02:40:40,070 --> 02:40:47,110
they'll take they'll watch a video and take it very
personally like well what if I can't do this thing okay then

2235
02:40:47,110 --> 02:40:55,150
you can't do it that's okay and so I experienced it
firsthand this morning when I was watching a TikTok and it

like rooms behind like doors like like you open up the thing
to think you're getting milk but it's actually a secret room

2244
02:42:15,010 --> 02:42:22,570
um yeah it's like an art installation yeah that's a better
art installation not exhibit um a playground for adults yeah

2245
02:42:22,570 --> 02:42:29,610
like it's not a real grocery store right it's just like an
art exhibit and so someone was just like you should check

2246
02:42:29,610 --> 02:42:39,150
out Omega Mart and the creator who posted the original video
about jungle gyms was like oh well Omega Mart's different

2247
02:42:39,150 --> 02:42:46,490
because it's an art installation this is an actual grocery
store so it's kind of different and then there's one other

2248
02:42:46,490 --> 02:42:56,110
person comments below and says yeah well you know um I can't
go to Ohio.

2249
02:42:56,350 --> 02:42:57,710
It's too far away from me.

2250
02:42:58,530 --> 02:43:01,550
Actually, Vegas is closer to me, so I'm going to go to Omega
Mart.

2251
02:43:04,890 --> 02:43:06,610
That's like, okay.

2252
02:43:08,250 --> 02:43:10,710
I mean, then don't go.

2253
02:43:15,740 --> 02:43:21,280
That's like, and people were like, people were like, I mean,
it depends on where you live.

2254
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:24,640
For some people, Ohio is pretty close, you know.

2255
02:43:25,400 --> 02:43:27,640
You can, some people can just go.

2256
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:28,520
And they were like, yeah, but I'm not.

2257
02:43:28,540 --> 02:43:29,340
I can't.

2258
02:43:30,700 --> 02:43:33,260
Vegas is closer to me, so I'm going to Omega Mart.

2259
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:38,880
I'm like, okay, have fun.

2260
02:43:39,320 --> 02:43:46,540
But, like, I don't know why kids take these videos so, like,
so personally now.

2261
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:53,540
Like, kids are, like, they'll watch something and be like,
if this doesn't relate, like, they take for you page

2262
02:43:53,540 --> 02:43:55,160
extremely seriously.

2263
02:43:55,300 --> 02:43:57,660
They're just like, this page is supposed to be for me.

2264
02:43:59,580 --> 02:44:07,860
everything should be catered to me you know what i mean i
think that's what it is i don't know it's so strange this is

2265
02:44:07,860 --> 02:44:17,820
what happens when you're raised by an ipad i don't it's so
maybe it is just an entitlement thing right i if it isn't

2266
02:44:17,820 --> 02:44:19,760
for me it's against me

2267
02:44:24,060 --> 02:44:33,240
oh the algorithm has failed me and it's your fault I don't
know I just never would I just I don't know if this is a new

2268
02:44:33,240 --> 02:44:44,880
thing or what because you know when I was a kid when I was a
kid like I would never watch a video and be like oh but they

2269
02:44:44,880 --> 02:44:58,520
didn't think about my needs it's a new generation thing so
crazy it's very interesting I mean it's not good maybe but I

2270
02:44:58,520 --> 02:45:02,580
just I just was so shocked that I experienced it firsthand,
you know?

2271
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:12,360
People being isolated at home, not socializing in person for
a while, probably did a whole lot of something.

2272
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:13,620
That's so true.

2273
02:45:14,340 --> 02:45:16,760
Oh, we need to get these kids on Homestar Runner.

2274
02:45:21,480 --> 02:45:23,180
Get off the skibbity toilet.

2275
02:45:23,940 --> 02:45:25,380
Get them on Homestar Runner.

2276
02:45:25,780 --> 02:45:26,600
Have them reading.

2277
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:28,520
Have them sending in strong bad emails.

2278
02:45:34,860 --> 02:45:38,580
But yeah, marzipan.

2279
02:45:42,140 --> 02:45:44,780
But yeah, this was fun.

2280
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:48,080
Hope you guys enjoyed being a little peasant.

2281
02:45:48,200 --> 02:45:49,700
Well, we weren't a peasant.

2282
02:45:50,180 --> 02:45:51,300
And then we became a peasant.

2283
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:55,260
And, okay, I want your opinion.

2284
02:45:56,220 --> 02:45:59,240
Would a maid be above a peasant or below a peasant?

2285
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:06,440
Like what if I, you know, what if I'm like a royal maid, you
know, like what if I'm working at like a...

2286
02:46:07,740 --> 02:46:07,740
Above?

2287
02:46:08,020 --> 02:46:08,220
Above?

2288
02:46:08,480 --> 02:46:09,820
Above, above, above, above, above?

2289
02:46:12,240 --> 02:46:14,460
Same level, equal, above?

2290
02:46:16,880 --> 02:46:17,760
Same league?

2291
02:46:18,400 --> 02:46:20,540
Depends on who you made for, I think.

2292
02:46:22,040 --> 02:46:22,480
Above?

2293
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:24,900
Above, above?

2294
02:46:32,730 --> 02:46:33,170
Okay.

2295
02:46:37,560 --> 02:46:41,060
I I was above the peasant

2296
02:46:45,640 --> 02:47:02,150

Okaerina-seima-se-se-o-jo-sama?

2303
02:47:30,300 --> 02:47:31,600
I said it at the beginning.

2304
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:35,100
I said, Okaerina-seima-se-go-shinima-o-jo-sama.

2305
02:47:35,460 --> 02:47:36,840

Oh!

2313
02:48:04,940 --> 02:48:06,560
That's why I said you're not a peasant.

2314
02:48:07,180 --> 02:48:08,680
You are above even the peasant.

2315
02:48:09,060 --> 02:48:10,460
You are big peasant!

2316
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:17,900

02:48:39,070 --> 02:48:41,150
Nobles have peasant maids.

2353
02:50:05,870 --> 02:50:06,950
Why is everybody suddenly gifting?

2354
02:50:07,850 --> 02:50:08,730
Shaman Maru.

2355
02:50:10,330 --> 02:50:11,950
RE4 is more action than scary.

2356
02:50:12,630 --> 02:50:13,450
You're way scarier.

2357
02:50:13,710 --> 02:50:19,610
See, that's why, that's actually partially why I've never
played Resident Evil because I always thought the games were

2358
02:50:19,610 --> 02:50:23,350
more action and scary, but just to me and my boy.

2359
02:50:28,910 --> 02:50:29,250
Stop!

2360
02:50:31,150 --> 02:50:31,670
No!

2361
02:50:35,530 --> 02:50:40,550
Because they were more action than scary, and I always was
like, well, I like scary games more.

2362
02:50:41,010 --> 02:50:46,230
But then 7 came out, and I was like, they're so scary now.

2363
02:50:46,930 --> 02:50:48,730
But they're also, like, so goofy.

2364
02:50:49,410 --> 02:50:55,010
I want to see Leon and Kat Does he actually wear cat ears or
is that just a meme?

2365
02:50:55,650 --> 02:50:57,410

02:53:49,490 --> 02:53:50,710
I'm not sure yet, though.

2411
02:53:52,390 --> 02:53:53,890
Tofu is an RE2 thing.

2412
02:53:55,110 --> 02:54:01,330
And I didn't, when I played RE, like, when I played Resident
Evil 1, I didn't even beat it.

2413
02:54:01,410 --> 02:54:03,130
I only played, like, a little bit of it, so.

2414
02:54:06,190 --> 02:54:06,930
Blade Runner.

2415
02:54:07,110 --> 02:54:13,650

positive reviews recently i don't know if they oh it says

fix now December 30th, 2023.

2422
02:55:14,230 --> 02:55:17,890
Seems like Night Dive has largely fixed the issues the
remaster had at launch.

2423
02:55:18,870 --> 02:55:21,270
Do yourself a favor and just play the enhanced edition.

2424
02:55:22,490 --> 02:55:22,730
Oh!

2425
02:55:23,730 --> 02:55:24,790

2426
02:55:24,990 --> 02:55:25,830
There we go then.

2427
02:55:26,990 --> 02:55:28,590
You heard it here folks.

2428
02:55:28,730 --> 02:55:37,150
According to Agent Smith on Steam, they said that it is
fixed as of December 30th, 2023.

2429
02:55:37,310 --> 02:55:38,350
That is really recent.

2430
02:55:41,110 --> 02:55:42,570
That's It's really recent.

2431
02:55:44,070 --> 02:55:45,510
If anything, it's only $10.

2432
02:55:46,190 --> 02:55:47,250
So, you know.

2433
02:55:47,630 --> 02:55:49,590

02:55:49,590 --> 02:55:51,190
I'm gonna go... Oh my gosh.

2435
02:55:51,350 --> 02:55:53,910
I'm like looking at it right now and it's so nostalgic.

2436
02:55:54,430 --> 02:55:55,850
Are there boobies in this game?

2437
02:55:55,970 --> 02:55:57,230
Or am I safe?

2438
02:55:58,510 --> 02:55:58,990
Hmm.

2439
02:55:59,870 --> 02:56:01,150
I don't know.

2440
02:56:03,410 --> 02:56:04,950
I'm not sure.

2441
02:56:07,570 --> 02:56:08,930
Sage, thanks for the 10 gifted!

2442
02:56:10,350 --> 02:56:10,830

2443
02:56:13,130 --> 02:56:31,030

don't know when this what this game came out 1998 hmm anyway

2444
02:56:31,030 --> 02:56:34,170

For free?

2449
02:57:23,940 --> 02:57:25,520
Played like a fiddle.

2450
02:57:26,940 --> 02:57:38,780
I mean, you can see, well, you can, the frills kind of block
my armpits a little bit.

2451
02:57:45,440 --> 02:57:50,340
It's, it's, I have to be, I have to be nice and breezy so
that when I'm working, you know.

2452
02:57:54,540 --> 02:57:55,900
It's got to be nice and breezy.

2453
02:58:00,740 --> 02:58:02,760
It's on the summer art, so ha!

2454
02:58:04,160 --> 02:58:05,060
You're right.

2455
02:58:14,740 --> 02:58:15,340
You're right.

2456
02:58:30,990 --> 02:58:32,090
Gotta take it down.

2457
02:58:35,790 --> 02:58:37,390
Time to take it down.

2458
02:58:42,390 --> 02:58:43,430
Get wrecked.

2459
02:58:43,850 --> 02:58:44,350
Mass recall.

02:58:44,750 --> 02:58:45,570

Cancel it.

2463
02:58:47,210 --> 02:58:48,090
Shut it down.

2464
02:58:48,970 --> 02:58:51,410
There's like a big red button in front of me.

2465
02:58:51,510 --> 02:58:51,910
And I'm like.

2466
02:58:58,430 --> 02:59:00,930
I forgot it was on the summertime merch.

2467
02:59:01,370 --> 02:59:01,570
No.

2468
02:59:03,050 --> 02:59:03,570

No.

2471
02:59:05,670 --> 02:59:06,970
I thought I was safe.

2472
02:59:08,290 --> 02:59:09,470
Don't look, you guys.

2473
02:59:09,750 --> 02:59:10,150
Don't.

2474
02:59:12,870 --> 02:59:13,470
Don't...

2475
02:59:13,470 --> 02:59:16,070
Don't look at my belly button.

2476
02:59:18,890 --> 02:59:20,730
As goes through, thank you for the tag gifted.

2477
02:59:20,910 --> 02:59:21,430

02:59:30,060 --> 02:59:32,180
Who's the fiddle now, Mentor?

2480
02:59:34,460 --> 02:59:36,380
Why are we here?

2481
02:59:36,900 --> 02:59:38,140
Just to suffer.

2482
02:59:44,300 --> 02:59:45,500
I perceive.

2483
02:59:50,780 --> 02:59:52,260
You better stop it.

2484
02:59:53,260 --> 02:59:54,580
You better stop perceiving.

2485
02:59:55,860 --> 02:59:56,700
Right now.

2486
02:59:58,740 --> 02:59:59,920
If one...

2487
02:59:59,920 --> 03:00:01,260
Wait, if you...

2488
03:00:01,260 --> 03:00:05,420
If you get ghost busted, do pieces of your outfit get ripped
off like it?

2489
03:00:19,800 --> 03:00:21,300
What is this?

2490
03:00:21,480 --> 03:00:22,920

2491
03:00:27,020 --> 03:00:37,300

03:00:37,300 --> 03:00:45,080
how yeah like senran kagura you know like with there's there
and there's like a lot of games like that when there's when

2493
03:00:45,080 --> 03:00:54,640
characters take damage they lose like their clothes just
tear apart that's why if you're going into battle just don't

2494
03:00:54,640 --> 03:01:07,300
wear clothes because if they're gonna tear apart anyway it
would be it would be oh a waste to lose them that's big

2495
03:01:07,300 --> 03:01:16,240
brain just don't wear them ah don't look where
