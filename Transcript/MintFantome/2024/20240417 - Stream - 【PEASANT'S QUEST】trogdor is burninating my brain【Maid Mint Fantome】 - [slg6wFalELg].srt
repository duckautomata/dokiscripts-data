1
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,680
I can't do it anymore.

2
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,740
I can't listen to this song anymore.

3
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,280
I can't do it anymore.

4
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,780
I can't do it anymore.

5
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,380
I can't do it anymore.

6
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,940
I can't do this anymore.

7
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,220
Please.

8
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,380
Please.

9
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,120
Oh my god.

10
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,860
It's just been beep beep beep.

11
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,260
Beep...

12
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,420
Beep beep beep beep...

13
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,240
Beep beep beep beep...

14
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,360
I can't do it anymore!

15
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,020
Ok, have you guys enjoyed the title screen enough?

16
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,380
Ok...

17
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,500
Yay!

18
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,560
Hello Everybody!

19
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,360
Hi!

20
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,640
Peace and quiet.

21
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,240
I had to turn the sound down so low.

22
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,100
Genuine tip for feeling sick.

23
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,020
Rub a little rubbing alcohol around your nostrils.

24
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,600
Also face bump your cat.

25
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,960
Guaranteed treatment for any illness.

26
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,140
No, I don't know.

27
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,240
I ate and then I was like...

28
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,160
I don't know.

29
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,000
My head started hurting.

30
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,920
Weird.

31
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,680
But speaking of my cat.

32
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,860
Yesterday I took him to the vet.

33
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,320
And he got poked.

34
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,180
And he got prodded.

35
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,840
And he...

36
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,220
Do you guys like the new emotes?

37
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,060
You guys are just spamming it.

38
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
I'm glad that you guys like it.

39
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
They're so good.

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,220
I'm glad you guys like it.

41
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,100
I'm glad.

42
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

43
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,960
Dear Moodment, please consider playing Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people.

44
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,980
This summer, you fit the demographic.

45
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,320
Crapfully yours.

46
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,840
Let me tell a story about my cat.

47
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,280
And then we'll talk more about Strong Bad.

48
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,460
I took him to the vet yesterday.

49
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,780
And I got him a bunch of tests done.

50
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,180
Not really a bunch.

51
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,340
Just like an overall...

52
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,040
Well, it was like a big test for senior cats.

53
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,520
Last time I mentioned him.

54
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,160
I was like, I smelled his little head.

55
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,060
And it smelled sweet.

56
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,880
And I was scared because cats smelling sweet is sometimes a sign of diabetes.

57
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,600
So I was like, oh no.

58
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,500
And I took him.

59
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,880
And they were like, wow, he's down two pounds.

60
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,660
Which they were a little concerned about.

61
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,160
But I have him on a diet.

62
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,500
Because last time, the time before I took him, they were like, he needs to lose weight.

63
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,020
So...

64
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,320
You know, he's down a little bit.

65
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,280
Um...

66
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,580
It's scary when pets lose weight.

67
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,140
Yeah, but they...

68
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,600
Um...

69
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,660
The doctor checked him yesterday and was just like...

70
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,460
I don't know.

71
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,800
I don't see anything wrong with it.

72
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,040
Or rather, I don't hear anything.

73
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,980
I don't notice anything.

74
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,760
So we'll send the tests in.

75
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,340
And we'll give you the results tomorrow.

76
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,000
I also had to reach into his litter box.

77
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,080
And take some poop.

78
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,460
So...

79
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:00,880
It was a really shitty day.

80
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,540
No, I'm just kidding.

81
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,240
Um...

82
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,640
Get it?

83
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,280
That's what happens when you...

84
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,720
When you...

85
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,860
When you have a pet.

86
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,900
Literally.

87
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,840
But...

88
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,960
When I went and got his lab results...

89
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,900
The doctor there...

90
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,200
She was like, oh my gosh.

91
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,540
Your cat is like...

92
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,640
First of all, every time I take him to the vet...

93
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,040
The vet...

94
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,580
And the technicians and everyone...

95
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,320
Everyone is like...

96
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,840
He is so good.

97
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,260
He's like the best cat I've ever worked with.

98
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,660
He just stands there and lets you do anything.

99
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,660
He doesn't fight.

100
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,520
He is so good.

101
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,320
He doesn't bite.

102
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,040
He doesn't scratch.

103
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,760
He's so sweet.

104
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
And I was like, yeah, I know.

105
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,240
Everybody tells me that.

106
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,880
He's my good boy.

107
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,420
But...

108
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,080
He's pregnant.

109
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,380
Close.

110
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,440
Oh my gosh.

111
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:57,860
So close.

112
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,480
Today...

113
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,640
The doctor was like...

114
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,600
We were oohing and aahing at your cat's results.

115
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,980
He is like...

116
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,940
The pinnacle of healthy...

117
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,820
For a cat his age.

118
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
He is so healthy.

119
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,760
Like...

120
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,960
There was nothing with diabetes.

121
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,600
Not even a worry.

122
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,200
Like...

123
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
He is...

124
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,040
My vet called my cat...

125
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,920
An unholy terror.

126
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,320
Yeah.

127
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,340
So they were like...

128
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,040
Nothing.

129
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,560
His heart is good.

130
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,580
His kidneys are good.

131
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,880
Everything is good.

132
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,020
We just have to look at his poop and make sure there is nothing wrong there.

133
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,580
But...

134
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,260
He passed.

135
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:42,760
Yeah.

136
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,780
He is healthy.

137
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,040
Yippee.

138
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,720
So I felt...

139
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,920
I felt so much relief after that.

140
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,680
Especially because she was so enthusiastic about it.

141
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,000
She was like...

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,500
He is so healthy.

143
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,420
And I was like...

144
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,440
He is a bit of a butthole.

145
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,420
But that's okay.

146
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,000
Diagnosis stinky.

147
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,620
True.

148
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,040
Did he pass gas?

149
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:10,680
You know...

150
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,480
He has been farting a lot recently.

151
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,280
It's...

152
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,880
You know...

153
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,680
He is just...

154
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Ghost cats are a little gassier than others.

155
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,260
I suppose.

156
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:23,980
But...

157
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,740
Thank you.

158
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,180
Thank you.

159
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,720
Can we get a butaro...

160
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,160
A butaro emo.

161
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,840
I will think about making one.

162
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,180
Maybe.

163
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,260
Yeah.

164
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,600
Maybe.

165
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,020
Maybe.

166
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,880
But yeah.

167
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,500
Anyway.

168
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:38,820
Sorry.

169
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,280
That's just a side...

170
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,920
I know I am talking in absolute silence right now.

171
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,840
I just couldn't keep the gaming...

172
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,800
That opening music.

173
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,180
on any longer.

174
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,780
Hope you feel better Min.

175
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,360
Thank you.

176
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,620
Based on the title though.

177
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,820
Which of these should I watch next?

178
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,700
Outlaws, To the Ends of the Earth, Super Dark Times, The Mimic.

179
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,980
I think The Mimic sounds interesting.

180
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,860
Or To the Ends of the Earth.

181
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,060
But I like The Mimic.

182
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,680
So...

183
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,740
Thank you.

184
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,160
Your cat won it.

185
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,400
Cat.

186
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,540
Here is cat money for the cat.

187
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,140
Thank you.

188
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,120
You know Yoko.

189
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,900
Your donuts makes so much more sense than they used to.

190
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,920
Dear Min Min.

191
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,620
How do you type with your sleeves over your hands?

192
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,700
Your super chatter.

193
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,620
Charo666 Well Charo.

194
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,080
This is how I type.

195
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,640
And then I punch the screen.

196
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,560
Super awesome punching.

197
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,020
Ba ba ba ba ba ba.

198
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,260
That's my...

199
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,960
That's my impression of Strong Min.

200
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,380
Deleted.

201
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,740
Strong Min.

202
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,180
Andragos thanks for the 10 gifted.

203
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,360
And KM thank you so much for the ping.

204
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,360
Oh wait.

205
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:03,880
You asked this.

206
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,760
Dear Strong Min.

207
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,660
How do you type with those big dorking sleeves over your hands?

208
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,320
Thankfully yours bent over.

209
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,460
Deleted.

210
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:11,640
Deleted.

211
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,670
Teen girl squad.

212
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,410
Cheerleader.

213
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,130
What's her face?

214
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:32,010
How do I make a voice that sounds like Strong Bad trying to talk like a teenage girl.

215
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,590
So as a kid I watched so much Homestar Runner.

216
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,410
Oh my goodness.

217
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,530
I watched way so much Homestar Runner.

218
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,210
And I played this game quite a bit.

219
00:10:49,150 --> 00:11:04,410
I don't remember at all how to beat it but I would like to try and get like I think with 150 points I would like to try and get every every little drop out of this game that we can get.

220
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,850
Thank you for the memberships.

221
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,450
Thank you.

222
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,850
Kenki Thank you.

223
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,110
Glad to hear he's alright.

224
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,770
I wanted to let you know that Streamer Life Simulator is free on Fanatical right now in case you needed any more games.

225
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,830
Streamer Life Simulator?

226
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,290
I mean I'm afterlife.

227
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:44,390
Like I'm dead so if I do a life sim it is it is I mean so if I um I don't get it.

228
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,510
Come on.

229
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,850
Wait I wait that's another reference isn't it?

230
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,890
I remember but I don't remember at the same time.

231
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,390
Your impression of Strong Bad doing a teen girl voice is so good.

232
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,190
And you keep it up so well.

233
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,330
Dear Strongman, I love you.

234
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:13,590
I think I once wrote into Strong Bad emails.

235
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,290
I think I once did.

236
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,290
But it never got chosen.

237
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,170
I'm so sad.

238
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,050
I wonder if he still accepts them.

239
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,850
Oh my gosh.

240
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,370
Thank you for the pink.

241
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,210
Thank you for the pink.

242
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,190
Strong Bad has the cheat.

243
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,730
Strong Maid has the chat.

244
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,050
I'm not gonna lie to you.

245
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,470
I'm a super chat from the 60s.

246
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,750
Here's a few things I remember from Strong Bad emails.

247
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,230
I remember the one when he makes an anime about himself.

248
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,310
He gives him the awesome blue hair.

249
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,390
I remember the The system is down.

250
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,170
The system is down.

251
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,910
Stinko man.

252
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,810
Oh my gosh.

253
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,250
Legitimate business.

254
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:03,950
Yes.

255
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,530
He has the rave when he makes the song.

256
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,390
Dear Strong Bad.

257
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,910
What would you look like as a Japanese cartoon?

258
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,550
And what would it be about?

259
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,050
Well.

260
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,170
If I was a Japanese cartoon.

261
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:22,010
I would be super boobylicious.

262
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,370
With a bubble butt.

263
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,110
And I remember the song about the cheat.

264
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,030
The cheat.

265
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,610
The cheat.

266
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:35,730
Strong?

267
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,310
What's strong?

268
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:36,790
Armstrong?

269
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,430
No.

270
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:37,890
Stop.

271
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:38,230
Please.

272
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,990
Metal Gear and Home Star Runner.

273
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,950
How can one ghost be so cultured?

274
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,250
Stop.

275
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,750
Toons.

276
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,550
Games.

277
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,190
Email.

278
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,510
Why is this so ingrained in my brain?

279
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,590
Oh my gosh.

280
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,130
Downloads.

281
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:01,350
Why is it so ingrained into my brain?

282
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:03,710
Characters.

283
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,530
Oh no.

284
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,850
Mint, you've always made my day better in life.

285
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,330
Without you it was ghastly, but now that you're back I feel like I'm in mint condition.

286
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,390
Love ya.

287
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:17,590
Thanks.

288
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,550
Limousine or sloshy?

289
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:21,990
I

290
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,210
don't remember.

291
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,810
The original brain rot.

292
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,230
Oh my gosh.

293
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,230
It was so much fun.

294
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:39,190
Actually, I think I tried to get my friends into Home Star Runner, but I got into Home Star Runner from another friend when I was a kid.

295
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:52,350
He and I would do the emails and try to find all the little hidden clickies in it, so that was a lot of fun.

296
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,110
I heard my name.

297
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,710
Well if it isn't Saucy Maid but oh my gosh it's an actual Armstrong.

298
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,610
Hello, Senator.

299
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,190
Oh shoot.

300
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,010
I just realized something.

301
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,390
But it should be okay until after stream.

302
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,910
I am constantly quoting Strong Bad anytime I see a protagonist with blue hair.

303
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,370
But yeah, so Home Star Runner was a huge part of my ghastly childhood.

304
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,430
And so was Peasant's Quest.

305
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,750
So we're gonna play it.

306
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,030
Here's how things work round here.

307
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,410
Tips for not morons.

308
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:31,950
Beginners.

309
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,930
Look around by typing stuff like look tree or just plain look.

310
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,750
Talk to folks by typing stuff like talk man.

311
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,610
Take items by typing get item.

312
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,630
Use items by typing use item.

313
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,770
You can also give item, throw item or some other action words.

314
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,770
Type in to see your inventory.

315
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,610
Type save to save your game and load to load one.

316
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:51,890
What?

317
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,830
You can save and load games?

318
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,790
To save games your browser must have cookies enabled.

319
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,930
Press plus and minus to speed up or slow down your character.

320
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:00,970
Okay.

321
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,350
Wait.

322
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,990
Wait.

323
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,550
Hold on.

324
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,530
Hold on.

325
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,410
Can I turn off the music?

326
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,230
No.

327
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,630
No, I'm not even reading it.

328
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:15,950
Hold on.

329
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,250
No, I can't do this anymore.

330
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,530
Please.

331
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:19,530
No.

332
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,490
No.

333
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:20,870
No.

334
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,170
No.

335
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,550
No.

336
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:21,950
No.

337
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,330
No.

338
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:22,690
No.

339
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,110
No.

340
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,370
No.

341
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,590
No.

342
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,810
No.

343
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,070
No.

344
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:25,350
No.

345
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,450
No.

346
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,830
I can't do this anymore.

347
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,410
Please.

348
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:30,850
Maybe...

349
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,450
Hold on.

350
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,410
I will...

351
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,290
You can start playing in a second.

352
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:38,690
Here.

353
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,490
Maybe it doesn't play the whole game, right?

354
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,850
Go for it.

355
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:45,770
Oh!

356
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:46,970
Oh!

357
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,310
Yes!

358
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,310
Okay, I'm gonna restart that.

359
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,470
I'm gonna restart that so we can...

360
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,510
I'll read it to you guys.

361
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,470
I'll read it to you guys.

362
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,530
Never felt so young until now.

363
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:11,350
Never felt so young until now.

364
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,510
Tongue looks like a thong?

365
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,770
Oh, my God.

366
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,910
Now that you say that, it really does kind of look like a thong.

367
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,530
No, I didn't want it to be that...

368
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,050
I didn't want it to be that sexy.

369
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,190
Okay, here we go.

370
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,490
Beep.

371
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,290
Beep.

372
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,090
Beep.

373
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:31,790
Beep.

374
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:33,850
Beep.

375
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:33,970
Beep.

376
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,690
Okay, okay, okay.

377
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,070
Alright, let me read now this.

378
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,690
Hayden, thank you so much for the 10 gifts.

379
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,210
Thank you!

380
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,450
You are rather dashing.

381
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,010
Oh, thank you.

382
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,310
A humble peasant living in the peasant kingdom of peasantry.

383
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,510
You return home from a vacation on Scalding Lake only to find that Trogdor, the Burninator,

384
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,130
That's a nice looking lake.

385
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,350
You can start playing in a second here.

386
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,830
Oh, my thatched roof cottages.

387
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,250
Thatched roof cottages!

388
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,690
Hello, sir.

389
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,810
Oh, talk.

390
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,350
You explain your situation to the knight.

391
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,430
That Trogdor burninated your cottage, and you have sworn revenge.

392
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,210
You ask for passage to the mountain to settle your score.

393
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,250
Hang on there, Trogdorkilla, says the knight.

394
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:51,430
I can only allow actual peasants up the mountain pass to face Trogdor, and you clearly are not one.

395
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,410
Look, dragon heart.

396
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,910
Fine, thanks for the tiny gift, and thank you.

397
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,630
You don't stink like a peasant.

398
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,170
You don't dress like a peasant.

399
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,250
Actually, I feel like I do dress like a peasant.

400
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,150
And you are definitely not on fire like a peasant.

401
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:14,470
Once those three things come back, and maybe we can talk.

402
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,110
Be sure to look around lots.

403
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,230
Talk to everyone you see and ask about stuff.

404
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,150
Type help if you get confused in inventory to see your worldly stuff.

405
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,570
Load your game, duh.

406
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,690
Oh my gosh.

407
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,610
If I just walk, I don't stop.

408
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,410
Look at me, I'm so dashing.

409
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,230
Do I need to put on some BGM for this game?

410
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,690
Actually, I don't know why I thought there might be BGM, but...

411
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,630
Here I go.

412
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,990
I'm walking here.

413
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,090
I can't stop walking.

414
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,870
Actually, is there...

415
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,530
Oh, there is a way to stop.

416
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,670
I'm going in.

417
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,190
I'm going down.

418
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,530
Man!

419
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:55,690
Look.

420
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,990
Why, it's half a lake.

421
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,330
With a fisherman in it.

422
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,110
And he's fishing.

423
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,150
Yell.

424
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:03,450
Oh.

425
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,590
Talk.

426
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,430
You holler at the old man about Trogdor, but he just grumbles about the fish not biting.

427
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,090
Must be the wrong...

428
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,570
I must be using the wrong bait.

429
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,490
He says...

430
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,210
Oh, sorry.

431
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,490
Must be using the wrong bait.

432
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,370
He says suggestively.

433
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,010
Can I fish?

434
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,470
Fish.

435
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,270
Swim.

436
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:28,770
Damn.

437
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,510
How do you say that suggestively?

438
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,190
Okay, I'm going to put on a little bit of BGM real quick.

439
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,270
Because it's kind of quiet.

440
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,230
Unless you guys don't have...

441
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,150
It's basically a podcast at this point.

442
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,550
Or I can sing the song again.

443
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,170
But...

444
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:44,670
But...

445
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,930
Oh, the press and minus.

446
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:46,570
Thank you.

447
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,610
Oh.

448
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,930
Oh, we're so fast.

449
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:54,970
Nice.

450
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,030
Where's my music?

451
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,470
Oh, here we go.

452
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,630
What do you guys want to listen to?

453
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,030
Let's listen to some cool...

454
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,990
Some chill music.

455
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:14,970
Cool.

456
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,670
Cool.

457
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,830
This isn't really fit the vibe.

458
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,790
But just pretend it's like after school.

459
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,510
And you're on your like Windows 98.

460
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,610
Actually, I don't know when this game came out.

461
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,650
I don't know if it's older or newer.

462
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:31,990
But...

463
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,350
And you're playing.

464
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,210
And it's old.

465
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,490
Oh, here we go.

466
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,270
Oh, yeah.

467
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,390
We're speedy now.

468
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,510
Wait.

469
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,570
Is this my house?

470
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,350
Eat.

471
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,990
Take berries.

472
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,250
You probably wish you could get that.

473
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:53,830
Oh, dang.

474
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,290
Okay.

475
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,420
What's here?

476
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,060
Knock?

477
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,200
It's open.

478
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,020
Oh, all right.

479
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,300
It's open.

480
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,260
Says a female voice from inside.

481
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,240
It's not open.

482
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,540
But you get her drift.

483
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,020
Open.

484
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,620
You open her up and head on in.

485
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,360
Yeah.

486
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,860
Yeah.

487
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,800
Oh, she's got a baby.

488
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,640
Talk.

489
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:22,700
Hello.

490
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,220
I'm...

491
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,680
You start.

492
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,980
But the lady cuts you off.

493
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:26,900
Okay.

494
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,280
Here's why I let you in here.

495
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:28,820
She explains.

496
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,560
My husband got squished by Trogdor.

497
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,520
And to make matters worse, the insurance riches I got were just stolen by the jonka.

498
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,700
Go steal them back for us and I'll give you something great.

499
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,820
ViviCore, thanks for the gift.

500
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,660
I never thought I'd see you play Baldur's Gate 3.

501
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:45,860
You're welcome.

502
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,500
I'll give you a gift.

503
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,100
Yeah, I think we're gonna go see Asterion.

504
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,740
Take...

505
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,240
No.

506
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,560
Talk.

507
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,040
Talk.

508
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,400
Oh, okay.

509
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:56,860
It's a take.

510
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,800
Grab.

511
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,900
Look.

512
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,220
What a depressing little cottage.

513
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,660
It reeks of single parent.

514
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,740
I mean...

515
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,840
Oh my gosh.

516
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,840
They said he is rather dorky.

517
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,180
Or dashing.

518
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,900
But they never said he is rather classy.

519
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,780
Dang.

520
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,400
Oh my gosh.

521
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,020
A lady rocks her baby in a chair.

522
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,240
A mostly empty shelf sits against one wall.

523
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,500
Mm-hmm.

524
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,240
Sav...

525
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,260
Rather savage.

526
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,340
For real.

527
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,440
Um...

528
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:35,920
What's this?

529
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,060
Can I sleep?

530
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,940
That's probably how the first baby got here.

531
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,200
Forget it.

532
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,820
What do you mean, by the way?

533
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:45,880
Look at that.

534
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,020
I...

535
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,980
I mean...

536
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,100
Yeah.

537
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,700
Oh my gosh.

538
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,520
Um...

539
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,780
Take...

540
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,820
What can I say again?

541
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,320
Um...

542
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,060
Look to...

543
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,920
Oh, where?

544
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,060
Where am I?

545
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,400
Where?

546
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,140
You're hanging out in the...

547
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,900
In baby lady cottage.

548
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,890
Can I take baby?

549
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,630
Take baby.

550
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,210
You wanna be part of this family?

551
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,050
Go get it.

552
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,770
Go get us those riches!

553
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,750
She shrieks.

554
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,430
Dang.

555
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,750
What is this, though?

556
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,350
Take...

557
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,410
Take feed?

558
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,050
Oh, you used to eat this stuff like crazy when you were a kid and your parents weren't watching.

559
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,590
Which was all too often.

560
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,030
You grab several large handfuls.

561
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,230
Oh, we got a point!

562
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,090
We got a point!

563
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,550
We have a chicken feed!

564
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,450
All right!

565
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,830
Nice.

566
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:45,250
Wait.

567
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:45,870
Can I take...

568
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,410
Okay.

569
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,670
Take pillow.

570
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,890
You don't have anywhere to use it.

571
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,050
Okay.

572
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,210
And it is rather bulky so you leave it.

573
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,920
Okay.

574
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,580
The baby lady calls after you.

575
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,240
Why don't you...

576
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,300
Calling her the baby lady instead of like...

577
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,880
Mom?

578
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,820
The mom calls after you?

579
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:10,960
No.

580
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,940
The baby lady.

581
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,640
Well, actually we don't know if she's the mom.

582
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,000
We have no idea.

583
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,600
Hey!

584
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,900
You're on some quest, right?

585
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,420
Well, the little squirt here lost something of mine in the yard the other day.

586
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,160
It's yours if you can find it.

587
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,680
Okay, let's look in the bush then.

588
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,420
Check bush.

589
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,540
Look bush.

590
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,420
You suspect they might be crunch berry bushes.

591
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,000
Take berry.

592
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,300
Okay.

593
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,640
Look bush?

594
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,460
Look bush?

595
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,680
Search bush?

596
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,180
Oh!

597
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,800
You reach into the bush to snag you some berries but they all just squish in your hand.

598
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,960
Okay, here we go.

599
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,520
Search, search.

600
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:06,140
I really liked the last podcast episode and did that personality quiz and I ended up with the same result as you.

601
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,400
Great minds think alike.

602
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:08,900
Right?

603
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,420
Search bush.

604
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,560
Nothing in this bush but squished berries either.

605
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,180
Let's check this one.

606
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,120
You guys are so smart at saying search.

607
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,160
Search bush.

608
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,940
Too bad you don't want any squished berries.

609
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,640
Because hey, jackpot.

610
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,320
Maybe I shouldn't be so aggressive.

611
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,920
Search bush.

612
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,400
You reach into the bush to snag you some berries but instead find a super trinket.

613
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,380
Get ye flask.

614
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,720
These things are awesome.

615
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,940
You have a sneaking suspicion that someone in this game will need this thing.

616
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,200
We're at three points already.

617
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,400
Feed.

618
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,080
Oh.

619
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:54,880
Huh?

620
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,260
You cannot get ye flask.

621
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,000
You can't get ye flask.

622
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,940
But you can't get ye flask.

623
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,160
What do you guys mean?

624
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,300
You can't get ye flask.

625
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:07,880
What?

626
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,340
Oh, what's our shirt look like?

627
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,880
I bet it's like a boy band or something.

628
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,960
Oh, it's so cute.

629
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,200
This has got to be your favorite t-shirt ever.

630
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,780
Oh, the times you had at Scalding Lake.

631
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,220
Canoeing, fishing, stoning heathens.

632
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,540
What a blast!

633
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,700
What is this thing?

634
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,280
This super trinket is weird.

635
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,960
It looks like it could either kill you or make you the hit of your Christmas party.

636
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,120
Whoa, gold nuggets!

637
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,320
Oh wait, this is just chicken feed.

638
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:43,920
Crap.

639
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,340
This game is so dumb.

640
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,020
This game is so silly.

641
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,300
Silly.

642
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:56,780
Sorry.

643
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,740
What was that?

644
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,530
What in the world was that?

645
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,330
I tried getting ye flask.

646
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,970
I could not get ye flask.

647
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,190
I tried and I tried and I tried and you wanna know what happened?

648
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:16,890
That's right.

649
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,790
I became ghost.

650
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,710
What is the flask?

651
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,130
I'm sorry if you could see my mouse.

652
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,370
Okay.

653
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,310
We'll go this way instead.

654
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,790
Look.

655
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,170
Rushing River.

656
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,850
Black and white.

657
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,710
Yellow tree.

658
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,310
Huh?

659
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,290
What?

660
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,090
Rushing River?

661
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,070
For the river.

662
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:45,750
Okay.

663
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,050
For the river.

664
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:50,810
Dang.

665
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,770
I miss Oregon Trail.

666
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,080
Backed with?

667
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,560
Between?

668
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,620
Everyone's giving me...

669
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,600
Everyone's giving me different answers.

670
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,040
Pee in the river.

671
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,100
Pee in river.

672
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,300
Doesn't understand your strange request.

673
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:15,620
Wait.

674
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,580
If I go over, is it gonna be that guy again?

675
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,300
Oh.

676
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,800
Look.

677
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,600
There's a really generic well here.

678
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,120
Oh.

679
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,460
And a picture.

680
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,900
Apparently, it's Autumn on this screen.

681
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,380
Well, well, well.

682
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,640
I gotta go for now, men.

683
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,380
But I hope you have a wonderful day and a wonderful stream.

684
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:38,680
Take care.

685
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,860
Thank you so much.

686
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,720
Thank you.

687
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:42,820
Use.

688
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,700
You don't need to use that now.

689
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:45,980
Crank.

690
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:46,960
That.

691
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,440
Soldier boy.

692
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,140
Dang.

693
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,800
Okay.

694
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:52,960
Okay.

695
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,120
Okay.

696
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,200
Don't go that way either.

697
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:58,480
Wait.

698
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,660
Wasn't it up though?

699
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,500
Wait.

700
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,700
What if I look at...

701
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,260
Oh.

702
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,140
Hold on.

703
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:04,920
Look!

704
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,740
It's the Carrack, you moron!

705
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,500
Get out of here!

706
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,020
Um.

707
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,200
This is a really creepy screen.

708
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,600
Why does it look like this?

709
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,200
Crank that hog.

710
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,880
Um.

711
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,640
Look.

712
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,200
Nothing special.

713
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,020
Nothing special here except for that weird wavy tree!

714
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,620
Who is that?

715
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,280
Look!

716
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,900
Man!

717
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,220
Talk!

718
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,060
You startle him and he disappears!

719
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:40,960
Oh god!

720
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,820
Oh my gosh!

721
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,120
What a suspicious...

722
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,080
What a suspicious man!

723
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,980
What a suspicious man!

724
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,800
I remember this part!

725
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,160
I remember this because look!

726
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,400
Move rock.

727
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,520
That!

728
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,020
I remember that.

729
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,780
You slide the stone over to reveal a little hole.

730
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,360
If only you could cut off your arms, legs and head, you might be able to squeeze through.

731
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,020
If only you could cut off your arms, legs and head, you might be able to squeeze through.

732
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,320
Yippee!

733
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,180
I remember that one.

734
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,380
I don't remember much of anything else though.

735
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,800
Knock?

736
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,480
You can knock until your knuckles bleed.

737
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,600
Nobody's home.

738
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,080
I'm a ghost.

739
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,920
I can fit through.

740
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,000
You know who could fit through?

741
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,840
The baby.

742
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:29,860
Oh.

743
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,440
Talk.

744
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,100
Your attempts at conversation are met with horse grunts and tail flaps.

745
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,640
Which is better than you do then...

746
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,160
Which is better than you do...

747
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,200
Which is better than you do a conversation with most people.

748
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,120
Which is better than you do a conversation with most people.

749
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,420
Ride.

750
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,360
Pet horse.

751
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,000
That's sweet.

752
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,580
Poor game.

753
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,520
Gary tries in vain to bite your arm off.

754
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,540
Thank you for the dough.

755
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:55,740
No!

756
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,900
That's a horse?

757
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,860
What is this?

758
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,460
Oh wait, look.

759
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,360
There's a rotten old horse!

760
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:02,880
It's a horse!

761
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,080
He doesn't look so good though.

762
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,100
Take Gary.

763
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,340
Oh my goodness.

764
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,700
He's probably wishing.

765
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,040
Eat flies?

766
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,040
Oh, there's the flies.

767
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,380
Eat flies.

768
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,920
How hungry.

769
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,100
He looks pretty.

770
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,580
You're hanging out in poor Gary's glen.

771
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,280
Why is he...

772
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,760
Someone take care of Gary so he's not so poor anymore.

773
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,190
Please, don't get kicked.

774
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,750
What's in here?

775
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,330
Search hat.

776
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,320
Sorry.

777
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,340
Sometimes my fingers work in really mysterious ways, you guys.

778
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,480
Sometimes

779
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:18,000
my fingers work in really, really mysterious ways and I don't know why.

780
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,080
That's after streaming.

781
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,800
Dang it.

782
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,720
You'll probably see me making crazy mistakes all the time.

783
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,860
This whole stream.

784
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,200
Did you find the rainbow?

785
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,940
Did you find anything?

786
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,640
Just some...

787
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,860
Just some edible glitter.

788
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,240
It's your sleeves.

789
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:11,960
Exactly.

790
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,900
Also the G and the H are right next to each other.

791
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,460
Okay.

792
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,020
You search and search through the haystack.

793
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:22,560
Nope.

794
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,120
No needles.

795
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,720
Someone had a good idea.

796
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,440
Take hay.

797
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,500
What do you think you are?

798
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,840
Some kind of thigh dungeon man?

799
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,300
You don't need any hay.

800
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:32,820
Okay.

801
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,200
What about for the horse?

802
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,300
Can I climb this tree?

803
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,220
Climb tree.

804
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,240
But then all your hands will get all sappy.

805
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,520
Oh.

806
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,140
What's this?

807
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,000
Read...

808
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:48,820
Note.

809
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,980
It says sacred...

810
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,200
Oh.

811
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,620
Scared of Carrick.

812
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,700
Go away.

813
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,460
J.

814
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,160
Okay.

815
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,480
Where am I?

816
00:34:59,560 --> 00:34:59,880
Where?

817
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,000
You're hanging out in Janka...

818
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,180
Oh.

819
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,800
This is where Janka is.

820
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,840
We need to talk to him.

821
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,160
Knock.

822
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,460
A gravely voice inside yells, just us chickens.

823
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,240
Oh.

824
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:14,640
Okay.

825
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,240
We're back here.

826
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,700
Love the podcast on Thursday.

827
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,720
Love to hear more about your music taste.

828
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,320
My music...

829
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,020
Oh, maybe we could do a music episode.

830
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,180
That'd be fun.

831
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

832
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,800
Oh.

833
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,640
Look.

834
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,140
You have chicken feed.

835
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,190
Wait.

836
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,430
What do you mean the chicken feed?

837
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,510
For us chickens?

838
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,070
There's a dried out mud puddle.

839
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,090
It's all caked up.

840
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,490
And cracked like the kind...

841
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,810
Like the kind that rock stars are always standing on.

842
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,390
What?

843
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,510
I don't...

844
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,310
I don't get it.

845
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,110
Okay.

846
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:05,490
Here.

847
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,130
What do I do with this chicken feed?

848
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,310
Throw chicken feed.

849
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,950
Use chicken feed.

850
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,110
You don't need to use that now.

851
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:19,810
Hmm.

852
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:19,970
Hmm.

853
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,070
My house!

854
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:33,970
The remains of your thatched roof cottage lie burninated before you.

855
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,250
You swear revenge against Trogdor.

856
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,190
You're hanging out in your burninated cottage.

857
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,630
Mint, if this is how you wanted to come out to us, this is really complicated.

858
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,050
Stop!

859
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,390
Stop!

860
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:59,470
One of my manga shelves broke down yesterday and a lot of the manga on that one had black covers so the damage is really noticeable pain.

861
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,870
No!

862
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:01,650
Oh my gosh.

863
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,250
I'm so scared of that day.

864
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,730
That like my shelf just decides to...

865
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,030
To break.

866
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,770
I hope never.

867
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,210
I have so many doujin.

868
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:12,570
Oh.

869
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,910
Can I take the berries here?

870
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,470
Take berries.

871
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:16,930
No!

872
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:17,250
Man!

873
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:17,610
No!

874
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:17,830
Geez!

875
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,670
Why not?

876
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,370
There's definitely half a lake here with a sandy shore.

877
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,770
There's some rocks here though.

878
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,870
Take rocks.

879
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,430
You grab a handful of fairly substantial pebbles.

880
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:44,070
You make sure to get an even mix of sedentary igneous and surreptitious rocks.

881
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,550
Yeah!

882
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,530
Wait!

883
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:49,910
Oh!

884
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,530
I know what to do with the chicken feed!

885
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,190
I just...

886
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,410
The guy fishing!

887
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,610
The guy fishing said that nothing was biting.

888
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,650
If we throw the chicken feed here...

889
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,150
Right?

890
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,090
Throw chicken feed.

891
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,030
You toss the feed into the lake.

892
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,810
You shed a tear for each one.

893
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,070
Goodbye, Monty.

894
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,110
Oh!

895
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,530
Oh!

896
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,800
Goodbye, Delga.

897
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:22,700
Rasputin.

898
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,700
Farewell, Combaldon.

899
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,220
That's so forth.

900
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,460
Ho ho!

901
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:36,760
Wow!

902
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,320
That crotchety old man just caught a pantload of fish.

903
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:48,000
Now I can get back to running the inn, he says and rows to shore and hauls his boat out and cleans guts and filets all the fish and a bunch of other stuff.

904
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,700
We didn't animate.

905
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,300
Yippee!

906
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:53,820
Oh my gosh!

907
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,940
We're making awesome time.

908
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,060
Oh!

909
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,480
The inn was right here the whole time.

910
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,260
There's a giant inn here.

911
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,980
Takes up, like, the entire screen.

912
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,320
I'm knocking.

913
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,240
Just open it, man!

914
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:09,920
Open.

915
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,240
Open the door and step inside the inn.

916
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,380
Oh!

917
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,100
He's back!

918
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,860
I'm going in here, too, then.

919
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:17,940
Open.

920
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,560
Look.

921
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:19,920
Look.

922
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,260
What a dump!

923
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,500
Only one bed and no mini bar?

924
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,420
The innkeeper stands behind a desk and there's a door that's closed.

925
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,780
Open door.

926
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,460
That's the pantry, says the innkeeper.

927
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,680
Employees only.

928
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,140
It's wild how much Skyrim ripped off this game.

929
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,500
I...

930
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,120
Right?

931
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,560
Like, this game is so innovative.

932
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,900
To every... to every game follow...

933
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,620
Like, every game following it has just taken everything from it.

934
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,260
Peasants quest walks so Baldur's Gate 3 could run.

935
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,960
Could we get a job here?

936
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,480
I don't know.

937
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:02,780
Sleep?

938
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,460
You probably ought to talk to that stinky old guy over there about that.

939
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,060
Okay.

940
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,720
Hello, sir.

941
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,580
I would like to inquire about a job.

942
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,580
If you're interested in staying the night, just type, get a room.

943
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,140
Get a room!

944
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,700
I only serve peasants here, fancy pants, barks the old guy.

945
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,900
Where's your robe?

946
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,220
Why are they so mean to me?

947
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,740
Oh.

948
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,660
What is this?

949
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,740
A single...

950
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,980
A signal lantern.

951
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,600
And of some kind hangs from a severely burninated tree.

952
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,600
Where am I?

953
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,560
I'm at the burninated tree.

954
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,260
Okay.

955
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,660
Nice.

956
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,320
There's a beautiful, magical waterfall cascading down the cliffside.

957
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,620
I'm gonna swim.

958
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,360
That waterfall would probably turn you into one of those weight gain protein smoothies.

959
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,960
So sad.

960
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,440
Burninated?

961
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,720
Oh yeah.

962
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,720
That's what Trogdor does.

963
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,120
He burninates the countryside.

964
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,880
He burninates all the people.

965
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,360
He's burninating all the thatch roof cottages.

966
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,060
Okay, so I need to figure out a way to kill this guy.

967
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,700
Oh, not here.

968
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,740
Where is he?

969
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,060
Is he down one?

970
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,640
Oh!

971
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,420
Hello.

972
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,060
Oh hi.

973
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,820
I'm Mendelev, says the archer.

974
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,340
I used to run a shooting range here with my brother, Dongolev.

975
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,440
But we don't talk so much anymore.

976
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,540
I haven't seen him in a dronka's age.

977
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,040
Have you ever run into him?

978
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,780
Tell him I said, Haldo.

979
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,760
You mean hello?

980
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,780
You ask?

981
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,140
Um, no.

982
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,020
Shut up.

983
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,880
I said Haldo and I met Haldo.

984
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,200
Tell him I said, Haldo.

985
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,620
Dang.

986
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,840
Can I play?

987
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,100
Play game.

988
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,460
The gallery's not open and you got no bow or arrows, Cupid.

989
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,660
Haldo, everybody.

990
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,360
And I said what I said.

991
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,400
Not much to see.

992
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,140
River's got a rock in it.

993
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,600
Take rock.

994
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,840
For what?

995
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,000
Now you're just making up puzzles to solve.

996
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,380
Sorry.

997
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,980
Wait, if I go back here...

998
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,160
And I go up...

999
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,460
Okay, we're here.

1000
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,440
This map makes no sense.

1001
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,420
Haldo, everybody.

1002
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,020
Does this lead to dronka?

1003
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,100
No, it leads to mud.

1004
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,220
Then this leads to jonka.

1005
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,700
No, it leads to hay.

1006
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,190
Can you swim here?

1007
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,590
I don't know.

1008
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:06,250
I still use Haldo to say hello to my friends.

1009
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,490
So crazy.

1010
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,910
This game is too influential.

1011
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,750
Wait, how do I get him out?

1012
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:14,890
Wait.

1013
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:15,030
Wait.

1014
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,790
Maybe the super trinket.

1015
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,370
Or...

1016
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,490
Can I throw the pebbles at...

1017
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,510
Maybe the...

1018
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,110
Maybe I can stone...

1019
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,490
That guy to death.

1020
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,590
Whatever his name is.

1021
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,270
Talk to jonka?

1022
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:38,570
Okay.

1023
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:40,430
Rock and stone.

1024
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,930
I thought I tried to talk to him.

1025
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:42,890
Did I not?

1026
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:45,050
Talk.

1027
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,090
Talk to...

1028
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,550
How do I spell his name?

1029
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:52,170
So glad to see my favorite ghost playing such a great game.

1030
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:53,050
Thanks, Black Knight.

1031
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:53,910
Thank you for the pink.

1032
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:54,850
Thank you.

1033
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,410
Wait, how do I...

1034
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:57,390
Talk to...

1035
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,190
How do I spell his name?

1036
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,390
Oh, there we go.

1037
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:03,370
It's sad when you have to make up people to talk to.

1038
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:04,410
Man.

1039
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,890
Person in my chat yelling in all caps.

1040
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,670
Dr. jonka.

1041
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,050
You're wrong.

1042
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,710
Is this it?

1043
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:14,350
Okay.

1044
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,070
Okay, hold on.

1045
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:18,510
Throw pebbles.

1046
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,300
Stone him.

1047
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,180
Death him.

1048
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,680
Kill.

1049
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,160
Will I die here if I...

1050
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,640
Where am I?

1051
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,220
Oh, there I am.

1052
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,480
I will die?

1053
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,600
Slash kill.

1054
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:43,600
Ha ha ha.

1055
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,180
Hmm.

1056
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,820
I think the guy, he'll want this.

1057
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,300
Okay.

1058
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,420
Is there anywhere...

1059
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:52,760
Map?

1060
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,460
Is there a map?

1061
00:44:53,780 --> 00:45:02,480
We are neither confirming nor denying the presence of a map in this game, but irregardless, you don't have one.

1062
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:05,780
Save?

1063
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:06,540
Okay.

1064
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,160
Oh.

1065
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,500
Oh, it does autosave, you guys.

1066
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,140
I think we're okay.

1067
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:13,260
Okay.

1068
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,480
But I'll save anyway.

1069
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:24,650
Okay, go away.

1070
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:25,790
Thank you.

1071
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:30,430
What have we...

1072
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,290
This one?

1073
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,450
Use.

1074
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:39,390
What else can I type here?

1075
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,580
Earward...

1076
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,320
Earward...

1077
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:45,680
This...

1078
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,100
Regardless.

1079
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:46,960
Okay.

1080
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,800
Okay.

1081
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,800
Dock deck.

1082
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,600
Welcome to membership.

1083
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:50,360
Thank you.

1084
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,480
Turn crank?

1085
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,180
Hmm.

1086
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:53,720
Hmm.

1087
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,160
Hmm.

1088
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:54,800
Hmm.

1089
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:54,980
Hmm.

1090
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,520
Turn crank?

1091
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,520
It won't budge.

1092
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,220
Maybe if there was something heavy in that bucket.

1093
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,540
Take bucket?

1094
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,900
You can't.

1095
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,480
It's tied to a rope and you're terrible with nuts.

1096
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,120
Jump in?

1097
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:07,640
Jump.

1098
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:08,900
Dang.

1099
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,560
Ha ha ha.

1100
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,360
Can you imagine?

1101
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,380
Like there's this area here.

1102
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,180
Great game choice.

1103
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:17,780
Love home.

1104
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,600
Home star runner stuff.

1105
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,260
Do you think Strong Bad is a Vtuber?

1106
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,020
I think so.

1107
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,460
He just used email instead of chat.

1108
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,720
Wasn't there a Strong Bad Vtuber that was made though?

1109
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,000
Like actually?

1110
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,760
Or am I going crazy?

1111
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,080
What's above the inn?

1112
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:34,860
Ah.

1113
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,300
Wait.

1114
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,060
What's up here then?

1115
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,080
Ah.

1116
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,900
Now we're on the other side.

1117
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:41,940
Oh.

1118
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,480
The world is so small and confusing.

1119
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,080
Burger buns.

1120
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:47,620
Welcome to membership.

1121
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:47,780
Thank you.

1122
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,600
Hmm.

1123
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,880
Try and make friends or buy Karak a cold one.

1124
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,200
I don't think I even have a place.

1125
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,960
Where can I even buy a cold one?

1126
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,500
The inn is useless.

1127
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:10,960
Okay.

1128
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,740
I need a robe.

1129
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:12,820
Hmm.

1130
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,320
We need to...

1131
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:17,700
I think.

1132
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,080
Okay.

1133
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,580
We need to figure out how we're going to kill this guy.

1134
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,580
The Karak.

1135
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,340
Did you just prove this world is round?

1136
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,020
And small?

1137
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,180
So very small.

1138
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,260
Call me Galileo.

1139
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,180
Magnifico.

1140
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,430
Did you try to seduce him?

1141
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:04,490
Seduce him.

1142
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,250
Kiss... kiss Archer.

1143
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,320
Can I take this?

1144
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,200
Take arrow.

1145
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:23,340
They have range printed on them, so it would be kind of embarrassing to have to shoot around with them.

1146
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,300
Also, that guy over there is giving you the evil eye.

1147
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,840
Hexadise, welcome to the membership.

1148
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,520
Thank you.

1149
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,080
See, I think the bucket is used for this, right?

1150
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,740
We'll get the bucket full of water.

1151
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,900
And maybe that's what we need to do, but it won't...

1152
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,560
It won't move.

1153
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,520
Yeah, we can't get it out.

1154
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,340
Use the pebbles.

1155
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,020
In the bucket?

1156
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,280
I think you're a genius.

1157
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,040
Where is it?

1158
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:10,960
What?

1159
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,580
Here?

1160
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:20,700
I'm trapped?

1161
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,280
Okay.

1162
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,720
Game is very specific.

1163
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,660
Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go.

1164
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,320
Use pebbles.

1165
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,340
I'm not supposed to use them for death?

1166
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,300
For stoning?

1167
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,340
I'm supposed to use them for... for life!

1168
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,880
What do you propose to do with them?

1169
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:40,560
Discuss.

1170
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:40,860
Oh.

1171
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,380
Put pebbles in bucket.

1172
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,320
You plunk all your pebbles into the bucket!

1173
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,640
The weight causes it to descend to the bottom of the well with a quickness.

1174
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:55,660
Crank.

1175
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,100
Level.

1176
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:56,740
Level.

1177
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,260
Level.

1178
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,540
Get to... bucket.

1179
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,320
Um...

1180
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,660
Raise bucket.

1181
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,060
Oh, here we go!

1182
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,320
What is that?

1183
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,320
The crank seems to have loosened and you haul the bucket back up.

1184
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,080
What's this?

1185
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,580
Why is there a monster mascus in there?

1186
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,220
No doubt left over from some pagan ritual.

1187
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,620
Silly pagans.

1188
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,140
You grab up the scary monster mascus.

1189
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,320
Man, this thing could scare a horse!

1190
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,160
Wear mask.

1191
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,900
Not on this screen.

1192
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,120
You've got to im-im-im-image...

1193
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,220
Wait, you've got your...

1194
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:39,160
You've got your image to think about.

1195
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,500
Oh, actually you might want to start deliberating on that right now.

1196
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,740
To the horse!

1197
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:49,900
To old Gary.

1198
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,800
Stinky Gary.

1199
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,260
Gary's gonna be really sad about this though, I think.

1200
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,320
Sorry.

1201
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,700
I can't read you guys, okay?

1202
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,300
It's very hard.

1203
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,300
With ghost eyes, okay?

1204
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,540
I died with poor vision, okay?

1205
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,640
Wear mask.

1206
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,000
You slip on the hideous monster mas- Oh, wait!

1207
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,780
I wanted to see the description of it first.

1208
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:22,800
Oh!

1209
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,680
You scared the crap out of poor Gary.

1210
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,900
He broke on through to the other side.

1211
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,120
Oh my god, it's terrifying.

1212
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:38,460
Man, those pagans sure can make a freaky looking mask when they want to.

1213
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,380
It's like those theater masks.

1214
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,840
Uncle... evil uncle or something.

1215
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,240
Yeah, basically.

1216
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,500
I don't know, when I was... this did not happen to me.

1217
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,920
But it happened to my sister.

1218
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,420
Um... hold on.

1219
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:01,050
My...

1220
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:01,710
Oh!

1221
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,210
It's brother!

1222
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,610
Wait, can I...

1223
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:11,290
Um, my grandpa went to go pick up my sister.

1224
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:13,330
And...

1225
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,710
It was when she was in kindergarten.

1226
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:20,430
And he decided to wear a scary mask.

1227
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:23,390
And barge into the kindergarten.

1228
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:24,750
Going...

1229
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:27,850
And...

1230
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:30,730
He got banned from doing that.

1231
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,510
He...

1232
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,570
Wasn't allowed to...

1233
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:35,170
Um...

1234
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,830
Pick up my sister anymore.

1235
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:40,610
Save...

1236
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:41,370
Save.

1237
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:46,690
What if...

1238
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,250
Oh!

1239
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,390
Hopefully this guy will have some sense and not shoot you.

1240
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:52,350
Oh!

1241
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:53,230
Oh!

1242
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,390
That guy has no sense.

1243
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:58,790
He shot you.

1244
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:00,350
Dumb, dumb, dumb.

1245
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:02,130
Nice one, William Tell.

1246
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:02,910
You dead.

1247
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:03,730
Thanks for playing.

1248
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:09,410
Yippee!

1249
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:11,830
Okay.

1250
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:13,830
That was fun.

1251
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:14,710
That was a...

1252
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:15,650
That was a good little...

1253
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:15,890
Okay.

1254
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:26,290
Now we say, Now we say, Now we say, Now we say, Now we say, Please help us top-up our store.

1255
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:31,050
Thank you,

1256
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:35,970
That's it.

1257
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:36,010
One up.

1258
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:44,890
We have reached four, Take us to the arcade!

1259
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:45,530
Oh...

1260
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:54,230
We are leaving都是ическиеス探子了 The series of We're getting somewhere, you guys!

1261
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,140
Now we go back to the archer.

1262
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,600
I want to see how they're doing.

1263
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,780
Our favorite brothers, look at them!

1264
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,100
They're so happy.

1265
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,500
Talk.

1266
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,880
Haldo, says the brothers, test your skill.

1267
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,680
Give us the right super item from your inventory...

1268
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,080
and you can give it as many tries as you need.

1269
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,720
We have a super item!

1270
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:23,840
Give...

1271
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:25,400
Trinket.

1272
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,100
That'll work, says Mendeleev.

1273
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,540
Just hit three bullseyes...

1274
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,920
and you win the super time fun bow TM!

1275
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,960
The arrow keys aim left and right on the space bar operates the bow.

1276
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,780
You'll need to press it a couple of times to get a nice shot off.

1277
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,720
But we don't give lessons, so you're on your own.

1278
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:49,880
Okay.

1279
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,960
I think we'll get it first try.

1280
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:57,580
Oh.

1281
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,760
I knew how it worked.

1282
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,180
Close!

1283
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,240
Oh my gosh, wait, there's wind too.

1284
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,820
So we need to go over this way, right?

1285
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,160
Like as...

1286
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:16,780
Huh?

1287
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:17,560
Huh?

1288
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:18,760
Ah!

1289
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,960
Did you guys see that?

1290
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,140
That...

1291
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,440
That was professional gaming?

1292
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:33,880
Professional gaming?

1293
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,520
I mean, I told you so.

1294
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,960
I told you guys.

1295
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:48,980
I told you guys.

1296
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,460
I told you guys I would get it first try.

1297
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,520
I told you guys.

1298
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,060
I told you guys.

1299
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,800
I told you guys.

1300
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:58,960
I told you guys.

1301
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,260
Pro gamer.

1302
00:55:59,540 --> 00:55:59,840
I know.

1303
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:01,860
I know.

1304
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,280
I told you.

1305
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:02,680
I told...

1306
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,940
You said you weren't an FPS player.

1307
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,000
I just...

1308
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,900
You know...

1309
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,340
I learned from the best.

1310
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:17,900
Me.

1311
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:23,540
Obviously.

1312
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:26,740
Nice shooting.

1313
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,340
Three hits, says Mendeleev.

1314
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,240
Here's your prize.

1315
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,260
You got the super time fun bow.

1316
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,160
T.M.

1317
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,260
We don't sell ammo.

1318
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,320
So you'll have to find your own arrows for it.

1319
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,760
Now we can go kill that guy.

1320
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,440
Wait, right?

1321
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:42,800
Wait.

1322
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,100
Oh, we see it.

1323
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:47,600
We have an arrow.

1324
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,180
Boy, you sure know how to pick them.

1325
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,120
This arrow is kind of pointy even.

1326
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,280
This is a pretty fancy bow.

1327
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:00,820
You're surprised those shady archers give away such decent prizes.

1328
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,180
You have expected goldfish in a bag.

1329
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,320
Let's go.

1330
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,760
Steel arrows.

1331
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,720
Wait, you can do that?

1332
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,140
Hold on.

1333
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,200
I got to save real quick.

1334
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,840
I can't stop coughing today.

1335
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,440
I'm so sorry.

1336
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,860
Dead eye ghost girl.

1337
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,240
Who's the big boss now?

1338
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:29,740
Me.

1339
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:29,900
What do you mean?

1340
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:30,800
What do you mean?

1341
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,700
Steel arrow.

1342
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:35,700
Oh.

1343
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,020
Steel arrow.

1344
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:38,740
Yeah.

1345
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:39,560
Oh.

1346
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,000
No.

1347
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:40,980
They're still watching me.

1348
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:41,540
Dang.

1349
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:42,900
Pollen?

1350
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:43,860
I think it is pollen.

1351
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,760
I think I have a bad allergy.

1352
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,220
Yeah.

1353
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,440
Coughing Tascaru.

1354
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:50,760
Now.

1355
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:53,720
Hi, Tech.

1356
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,620
Welcome to membership.

1357
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,540
Thank you.

1358
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,440
Let's take some arrows here, I guess.

1359
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,720
Do I need them?

1360
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,100
Do I need any more?

1361
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,120
I think I can one-shot him.

1362
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,320
Take arrow.

1363
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,340
You're pretty much all set on the arrow front.

1364
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,680
They are kind of cool, though.

1365
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,020
Okay.

1366
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,780
We're confident, you guys.

1367
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,940
Have confidence.

1368
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,720
Have confidence.

1369
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,840
We're going to kill this guy.

1370
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,020
We're going to kill him dead.

1371
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,140
Kill.

1372
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,980
Shoot arrow.

1373
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,600
Here goes nothing, Kid Icarus.

1374
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:25,700
What?

1375
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:29,600
Arrow.

1376
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:29,720
Arrow.

1377
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:31,820
Nice shot.

1378
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,820
You smote the Carrick.

1379
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,680
He lay there, stinking.

1380
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,500
Just like my cat.

1381
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,120
Oh.

1382
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:46,320
A light rain heralds the washing free of the Carrick's grip on the land.

1383
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,520
You're feeling pretty good, though.

1384
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,160
So the artless symbolism doesn't bug you.

1385
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,840
I'm going to take my arrow back.

1386
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:56,860
Take arrow.

1387
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,200
Ew.

1388
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,040
No way.

1389
00:58:59,140 --> 00:58:59,700
That thing is going to die.

1390
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,600
It's got some serious Carrick brand cooties on it now.

1391
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,840
Not the cooties.

1392
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,740
Terrible day for rain.

1393
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,160
Cry for Carrick.

1394
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,620
What's his name?

1395
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:13,900
Carrick.

1396
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:15,980
Carrick.

1397
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:17,660
Look.

1398
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,820
There are large hoof prints in the grass here.

1399
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,560
There's a large Carrick shaped mound on the grass.

1400
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,720
Cry for Carrick.

1401
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,700
It's got some serious Carrick brand cooties on it now.

1402
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:29,720
You can call it that one.

1403
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,400
This eye has no empathy.

1404
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,840
Take his belt.

1405
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,240
Strip.

1406
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,080
Everything.

1407
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,880
Steal.

1408
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,140
Rob him.

1409
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,020
Loot him.

1410
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,060
Take everything he's got.

1411
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,080
Rob him for all he's worth.

1412
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,140
Steal his fortune.

1413
00:59:59,280 --> 00:59:59,680
Richard.

1414
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,620
Search?

1415
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,420
Search Carrick.

1416
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:08,160
I think we have exhausted everything.

1417
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,240
Oh!

1418
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:10,980
Oh!

1419
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:36,100
Oh my gosh, this is literally the Bigfoot over here.

1420
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,640
I look like Bigfoot right now.

1421
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,620
Type cheat?

1422
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,040
What happens if I type that?

1423
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:50,340
Cheat.

1424
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:51,600
Meh.

1425
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,180
I look like Bigfoot over here.

1426
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:01,540
Okay, this guy should now be... Oh yes, there he is!

1427
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:02,960
Talk.

1428
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,660
The Carrick is dead, he cries and hops around some more.

1429
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:10,960
You wonder how someone this primitive could have made that much dough.

1430
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,500
Hello?

1431
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:15,920
Talk?

1432
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:22,770
Take gold.

1433
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:27,730
The Janka will see you and rip out your jugular with his teeth or something equally horrible.

1434
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:30,290
Steal.

1435
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:32,550
Steal.

1436
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:33,590
Treasure.

1437
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:37,500
Wait.

1438
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,260
Let's just go get another arrow.

1439
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,380
Let's just go get another arrow.

1440
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,640
We can solve all of our problems.

1441
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:53,560
Oh!

1442
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:57,900
Take arrow.

1443
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:02,340
You grab yet another arrow from the tree hoping to get some bonus points.

1444
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,040
Okay.

1445
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,220
Let's go kill him.

1446
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,060
Let's go kill the Janka.

1447
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:12,840
Yeah!

1448
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,820
We're gonna go kill him.

1449
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,240
Shoot.

1450
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,200
Shoot Janka.

1451
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,380
Shoot bow.

1452
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,720
Fire.

1453
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:28,940
Kill.

1454
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,120
Kill Janka.

1455
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,500
No way!

1456
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,080
Jankas are born scrappers!

1457
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,320
He may be little but he'll crawl ya.

1458
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,240
Shoot arrow.

1459
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,260
The game is not letting me choose violence.

1460
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,260
So we need to distract him somehow.

1461
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,140
What do I have?

1462
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,240
The monster mask.

1463
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,140
Maybe he'll be afraid of me.

1464
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,800
Wear mask.

1465
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,760
Tell him a joke.

1466
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:08,300
Hmm.

1467
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,120
Hmmmmm...

1468
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,000
No violence?

1469
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,660
What else can we...

1470
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,880
do?

1471
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:19,680
Um, wait!

1472
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,700
I'm kind of stinky now, right?

1473
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,620
So maybe the...

1474
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,680
The innkeeper will let us...

1475
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,780
Let us in?

1476
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,800
Welcome to membership!

1477
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:30,760
Thank you!

1478
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,460
A bribe.

1479
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,200
Do I have anything?

1480
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:42,880
My t-shirt?

1481
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,640
He wants my t-shirt, maybe?

1482
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:51,170
Here we go.

1483
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,350
To the end.

1484
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,190
We're gonna say...

1485
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:55,690
Open.

1486
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:59,930
Get a room!

1487
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:03,150
I only serve peasants here, fancy pants.

1488
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,030
Where's your robe?

1489
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:08,270
Can't you see that I'm quite peasant-ly looking?

1490
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,570
How am I not a real peasant, I wonder?

1491
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:14,530
Hyper dude man, welcome to the membership, thank you.

1492
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:20,810
Master 117, welcome to membership, thank you.

1493
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:24,330
Baby lady.

1494
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:26,990
We haven't seen her in a while.

1495
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:37,870
No, she says the same thing.

1496
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:39,670
This place is dead anyway.

1497
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:41,450
Dang!

1498
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:45,710
Is there a mewing commet?

1499
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:50,970
Is that actual mewing emote?

1500
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:53,290
What?

1501
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:55,970
Oh my god, not the Lorax.

1502
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:57,610
He speaks for the trees.

1503
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:02,650
Welcome to the peasantship.

1504
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:07,450
Also,

1505
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:13,220
the hay.

1506
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:15,580
I'm trying to think of what else.

1507
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,480
Okay, so we...

1508
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,020
Killed him.

1509
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,580
We scared Gary.

1510
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,380
There's the hay.

1511
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,520
Search hay.

1512
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,640
No needles.

1513
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:35,440
There's nothing else because we got the farn- or the fissure.

1514
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:40,280
Roll in hay.

1515
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,060
Roll in hay.

1516
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,540
No.

1517
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,340
Eat...

1518
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,440
I did it again.

1519
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,840
I did it again.

1520
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,200
It means eat happy, you guys.

1521
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,080
Eat happy.

1522
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,340
By the way, what are you playing this on?

1523
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,780
Is it a recent re-release?

1524
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:16,120
I'm on the homestarunner.com website.

1525
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,160
Actually, find needle.

1526
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,320
No.

1527
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,820
I saw some people say jump in hay.

1528
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,840
You've not known much better than a roll in the hay alone.

1529
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:32,620
What?

1530
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,660
Wait, that was right?

1531
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,880
You leap in the hay like a two-year-old boy.

1532
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:38,720
Uh-oh.

1533
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,300
The hay sticks to your muddy body.

1534
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,200
You're a walking hay bale.

1535
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:44,520
Just like that one guy from that one show.

1536
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:48,000
Oh my god.

1537
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,720
I'm just hay.

1538
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:56,280
Oh, the winds are heavy and all but a couple of key screens.

1539
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:58,480
Looks like you're no longer in...

1540
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:00,700
Stealth mode.

1541
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:03,880
Okay.

1542
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,960
We gotta go into stealth mode.

1543
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,140
Jump in hay.

1544
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:14,980
Oh, yeah.

1545
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:18,620
He looks so excited to get in there, you know?

1546
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:19,940
Hey, nice disguise.

1547
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,920
The jonka doesn't seem to notice you.

1548
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:27,140
Steel.

1549
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,180
Gold.

1550
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:37,320
I wanted to say that I've been enjoying all your streams since you came back.

1551
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:38,140
I can't wait to watch more.

1552
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,860
Also, since you started streaming again, you've become one of my favorite YouTubers to watch.

1553
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:42,780
Oh my gosh.

1554
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:43,180
What?

1555
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:43,840
No way.

1556
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,760
Little old me.

1557
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,540
Thank you so much.

1558
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,320
Mr. Mike Tyson's butt.

1559
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:55,680
Oh, oh.

1560
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:00,040
A stiff breeze blew all the hay and surprisingly the mud off of you.

1561
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:02,700
You take my riches, growls the jonka.

1562
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,560
Run?

1563
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,020
Run?

1564
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:07,360
Go run?

1565
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:08,420
Uh...

1566
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,060
Run.

1567
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,020
Just answer him.

1568
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:11,960
Oh, yes or no.

1569
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:12,520
You fool.

1570
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:12,860
Oh.

1571
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:13,720
No.

1572
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:14,840
Okay.

1573
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:17,280
Let me know if you see riches anywhere.

1574
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:20,200
Huh?

1575
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,200
Just a hay.

1576
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,300
He grunts and goes back to his hopping.

1577
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,140
You smooth talker, you.

1578
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,920
All right, let's go to the baby lady.

1579
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:36,660
Fooled.

1580
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,140
Oh, no.

1581
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:39,240
Our mud is gone.

1582
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:42,420
That was so easy.

1583
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,340
We're going to be a peasant in no time, you guys.

1584
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,200
Except we've done 41 things and we don't even stink.

1585
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,360
We don't even anything.

1586
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,800
How are we supposed to become a peasant?

1587
01:08:58,740 --> 01:08:59,480
Okay, lady.

1588
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:02,540
Uh...

1589
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:02,800
Oh.

1590
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,560
These riches though.

1591
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:08,220
Riches, dude.

1592
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,020
Riches.

1593
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:12,040
That peasant lady totally has to share some of this with you, right?

1594
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:15,600
At least that shiny clawed scepter thing.

1595
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,020
She will.

1596
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,640
She's a good lady.

1597
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,480
She's a good mom.

1598
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:23,320
She's been raising her baby all by herself.

1599
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,000
She's a good lady.

1600
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:25,640
She's nice.

1601
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,840
She's going to...

1602
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,940
She's going...

1603
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:28,600
She's...

1604
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,480
She's a good lady.

1605
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,700
Give riches.

1606
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:34,220
My riches!

1607
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,920
She screams and snatches up every last gold coin.

1608
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:37,960
Thanks, sucker.

1609
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,460
Here you go.

1610
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,840
She shoves the baby into your hands.

1611
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,680
And bolts out the door.

1612
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,220
Huh?

1613
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,940
You later learn that she does this all the time.

1614
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,160
And is wanted throughout the countryside.

1615
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,060
Those riches probably were the Junkas.

1616
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,520
And who knows whose baby that is.

1617
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:04,180
Well, it's yours now.

1618
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:06,740
I got scammed.

1619
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,800
I got scammed.

1620
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:14,360
Is there a baby in my inventory now?

1621
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:16,400
Baby.

1622
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:16,720
Oh.

1623
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,560
It's a beautiful blue-eyed baby.

1624
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,300
Aw, peasant babies are adorable.

1625
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,720
No wonder they fetch such a pretty penny on the black market.

1626
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,720
Now we're going to throw this baby.

1627
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,640
Oh, it's kind of creepy.

1628
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,640
The rocking chair is still rocking.

1629
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:48,260
There is...

1630
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,300
It reeks of single parrot.

1631
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,200
It's such a...

1632
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,300
Savage lion.

1633
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:54,880
Mint is cute.

1634
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,160
Stop.

1635
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,280
Stop it.

1636
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:02,380
Stop.

1637
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,400
Stop it.

1638
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,160
Stop it.

1639
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:08,440
Stop it.

1640
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:17,420
Stop it.

1641
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,480
There's one of those self-rocking chairs.

1642
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,520
A mostly empty-shelf sit...

1643
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:21,780
Okay.

1644
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,420
Oh, it's a self-rocking chair.

1645
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:24,580
She was even too...

1646
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:32,020
Thanks for the super chat.

1647
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,440
Wait, why can't I move?

1648
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:40,980
Oh, there we go.

1649
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:45,220
I'm gonna go to the lake and throw the baby into the lake for the gods.

1650
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,240
Oh, here we go.

1651
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,600
Throw baby!

1652
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,780
You already fed the fish.

1653
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,960
Let's get moving here, people.

1654
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:01,400
The fish on the other side!

1655
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,820
Throw that baby!

1656
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,440
Throw that baby!

1657
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:08,700
Throw that baby!

1658
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,260
Throw that baby!

1659
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,560
Throw baby!

1660
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,600
Maybe try again from the center of the lake.

1661
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:16,680
Looks deeper there.

1662
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,400
Throw that baby!

1663
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,040
Throw that baby!

1664
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:22,800
Where is the center?

1665
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,760
Throw baby!

1666
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,860
Throw baby!

1667
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,740
Maybe try someplace else.

1668
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,680
Throw that baby!

1669
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:37,320
I accidentally clipped into the table for a second.

1670
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,060
Throw baby!

1671
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,440
Where else can we throw the baby?

1672
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:43,360
The waterfall!

1673
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:44,840
Oh my gosh, the waterfall!

1674
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,540
Throw that baby!

1675
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,320
Throw that baby!

1676
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,540
Down the well!

1677
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:52,860
Throw baby!

1678
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,260
Throw it where?

1679
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,640
Throw baby down well!

1680
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:58,300
Dang.

1681
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,900
Put baby in bucket.

1682
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,760
You're not that keen a shot.

1683
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,320
Try standing a little closer.

1684
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:09,640
I'm as close as it can be.

1685
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,180
Baby in bucket.

1686
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,560
Dang.

1687
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,920
Throw that baby!

1688
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:18,600
Throw that baby!

1689
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:22,360
Wait, how do I get to the center of the lake?

1690
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,470
I forgot about this guy!

1691
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:33,390
I'll give him the baby.

1692
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:36,230
I'll give him the baby.

1693
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:36,490
I'll give him the baby.

1694
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,530
I'll give him the baby.

1695
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:42,250
I'll give him the baby.

1696
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:42,450
I'll give him the baby.

1697
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:45,150
I'll give him the baby.

1698
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:47,810
I'll give him the baby.

1699
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:48,230
I'll give him the baby.

1700
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:49,350
I'll give him the baby.

1701
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:49,490
I'll give him the baby.

1702
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:50,010
I'll give him the baby.

1703
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:55,110
I'll give him the baby.

1704
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:57,270
She threw that baby!

1705
01:13:57,890 --> 01:14:02,190
Actually, I have to or else I'm going to be a liar.

1706
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:04,830
Where is he?

1707
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:05,770
Did he go home?

1708
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:10,370
Throw baby.

1709
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:13,190
Give baby.

1710
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:14,790
Talk.

1711
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:18,750
How do we not startle him?

1712
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,120
Is this guy okay?

1713
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,420
I kind of feel bad now.

1714
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,780
The Carrick is dead!

1715
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,100
Oh yeah, that's right.

1716
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,120
Can I go into his house?

1717
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:37,940
Knock.

1718
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:38,420
Open.

1719
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,320
No.

1720
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:39,840
Dang.

1721
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:42,300
Wave.

1722
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:43,300
Wave.

1723
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,200
Give him a big hearty wave.

1724
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,540
Okay, what do we have?

1725
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,200
Arrow.

1726
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:50,840
Baby.

1727
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:52,220
Bow.

1728
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,140
Mask.

1729
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:54,860
We got to use the baby.

1730
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,240
We got to throw the baby somewhere.

1731
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,600
I think it's the waterfall.

1732
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:01,600
Throw that baby.

1733
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:03,600
Give baby.

1734
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,120
You think he wants the baby?

1735
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:09,680
Give baby.

1736
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,120
No.

1737
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:15,460
How close are you to getting your own thatched roof cottage?

1738
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,600
I don't think I want one.

1739
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:23,720
Because if I get one, Trogdor is going to come and burninate it.

1740
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,680
That would be really unfortunate.

1741
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:28,500
And I have to go on my own quest.

1742
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,540
I'd also have to become a peasant.

1743
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,000
I'm already a maid.

1744
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,940
Can I get any lower than this?

1745
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:36,140
Like, come on.

1746
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:38,380
I'm already a servant, essentially.

1747
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,500
Give baby.

1748
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,280
Don't need nothing from no filthy peasantses.

1749
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:48,840
I'm not...

1750
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,220
He said I'm a peasant.

1751
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:50,840
For real.

1752
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,600
You are, but you get paid.

1753
01:16:03,610 --> 01:16:04,770
I forgot about this room.

1754
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:05,930
Wait a second.

1755
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,750
Is this where you...

1756
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:11,930
Use baby.

1757
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:14,690
Deploying queue, baby.

1758
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,620
No, baby, come back.

1759
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,700
Baby, come back.

1760
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,580
No, my baby.

1761
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:35,660
My baby.

1762
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,240
Way to go, baby.

1763
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:42,720
It got the cottage door open and headed off to a new life.

1764
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:43,360
Baby!

1765
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,860
He becomes valedictorian of his graduating class.

1766
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,700
Goes to scalding lake state.

1767
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:52,020
Gets a degree in advanced peasantry.

1768
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,860
And lands a job at thatch pro.

1769
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,480
Building better cottages.

1770
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,140
For a better tomorrow.

1771
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:01,460
My baby.

1772
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,760
You grow apart.

1773
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,700
And the letters from him become fewer and fewer.

1774
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:08,760
He develops a severe mead problem.

1775
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,080
And blames you for never being there.

1776
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:16,740
Wait.

1777
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,060
Did I read...

1778
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,660
Is that mead or med?

1779
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,520
Like head or reed?

1780
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:22,800
What is...

1781
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,780
What is mead?

1782
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:28,440
What is that?

1783
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,520
Oh, I got more points.

1784
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:36,690
Oh, it's alcohol.

1785
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:37,870
Like reed.

1786
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:38,970
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1787
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:39,750
So, what is mead?

1788
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,990
He gets a alcohol addiction?

1789
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:45,650
Oh my gosh, my baby.

1790
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:46,550
You went to...

1791
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:47,830
You went to scalding lake...

1792
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:48,650
state.

1793
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:53,190
The pressure was too hard on you?

1794
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,010
Normal plant.

1795
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:55,690
Welcome to membership.

1796
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:56,310
Thank you.

1797
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:59,110
An alcohol made from honey?

1798
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:00,770
Honey wine?

1799
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:01,930
Wait, is it good?

1800
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:04,970
Mead is a type of alcohol made with fermented honey.

1801
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:08,130
How can you ferment honey?

1802
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:10,370
Open.

1803
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:12,450
A search drawer.

1804
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:14,230
Search?

1805
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:16,130
Look.

1806
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:20,530
This place could use some serious sprucing of the up variety.

1807
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:25,590
There's a dresser over there and a broom kind of silhouetted all mysterious like.

1808
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:27,650
Open...

1809
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:28,690
Oh, no.

1810
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:31,030
Search dresser.

1811
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:34,290
Uh...

1812
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:34,910
Huh?

1813
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:38,650
I'm in mysterious cottage.

1814
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:41,910
What can I say?

1815
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:44,270
Open dresser.

1816
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:45,390
Oh, there we go.

1817
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:48,370
There's a vintage peasant robe in there.

1818
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:50,590
Just like grandpa used to wear.

1819
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:52,750
Wear robe.

1820
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:57,490
You don't have anything but your scalding lake t-shirt and pants.

1821
01:18:57,890 --> 01:18:59,330
Forgot to mention the pants.

1822
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:01,310
Take robe.

1823
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,590
Yeah, get that robe.

1824
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:06,190
Wear robe?

1825
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,210
You slip into the vintage robe.

1826
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,210
It smells like grandpa's...

1827
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:11,310
Ew.

1828
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:13,370
Grandpa's lap?

1829
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:16,830
No, you're looking like a serious peasant.

1830
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:20,370
Mint's got...

1831
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:20,670
Oh, sorry.

1832
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:23,530
I didn't mean to kick my mic.

1833
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:25,350
Mint's got that baby fever.

1834
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:26,730
Hmm...

1835
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:28,610
I want my...

1836
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:29,150
I want...

1837
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:30,210
I want baby back.

1838
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,330
You guys, we're a peasant!

1839
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:35,390
We're a peasant!

1840
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:36,650
Let's go to the inn.

1841
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:40,090
Let's go to the inn.

1842
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:41,290
Let's go to the inn.

1843
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:59,370
We have to catch ourselves on fire here, I'm assuming, right?

1844
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:13,370
I'm sure I'll remember to collect the fee come morning.

1845
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:15,450
Good night, everybody.

1846
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:24,570
Night falls like a bad PowerPoint presentation.

1847
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:26,630
Allie, welcome to membership.

1848
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:27,650
Thank you.

1849
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:32,810
Whoa, it's night.

1850
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:34,470
What an uncomfortable bed.

1851
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:38,930
You sleep for maybe 20 minutes before the extreme pain in your spine forces you to get up.

1852
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:41,030
He left the pantry.

1853
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:43,650
What can we take?

1854
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:45,490
Take candle.

1855
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:48,910
Seems like you should be able to do that, doesn't it?

1856
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,490
Sorry, no dice.

1857
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:53,990
A small hint of brilliance.

1858
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:58,230
Mint is a ghost, but she can wear clothes, right?

1859
01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:03,110
She can still be a peasant because it's not her on fire, but the robe.

1860
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:06,530
Yeah!

1861
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:08,630
So true.

1862
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:11,950
The brilliance is magnificent.

1863
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,870
Still dark out, the grimy old innkeeper is gone and he's left the pantry open.

1864
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:21,470
Search pantry.

1865
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,950
Look pantry.

1866
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:28,010
Shelves and shelves of something called old band rub.

1867
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:34,710
I want my baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby back.

1868
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:37,670
Chilis, baby back ribs.

1869
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:39,550
What is this?

1870
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:42,850
Yes.

1871
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,230
Old man rub.

1872
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,170
Old man rub.

1873
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:54,550
The only thing of interest is a big black pot of horse grease up on the top shelf.

1874
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:58,730
Take horse grease.

1875
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:01,410
You reach way up to the top shelf.

1876
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:06,270
Oh, great.

1877
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:10,610
Now you can't see a thing and your head is covered in highly flammable horse grease.

1878
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:13,890
You better get out of here before that disgusting old man comes back.

1879
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:14,430
Oh.

1880
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:16,050
Oh, no.

1881
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:17,710
Oh, my keys are all messed up.

1882
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:17,950
Wait.

1883
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:18,190
Okay.

1884
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:19,590
This way?

1885
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:20,050
This way.

1886
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:21,630
This way.

1887
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:24,870
Oh.

1888
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:26,010
Whew.

1889
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:27,070
That was close.

1890
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:30,070
Phew.

1891
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:33,450
That cause me hell.

1892
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:35,810
All right.

1893
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:39,230
Thank you for the really…really big arigato cheese.

1894
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:44,510
Thank you.

1895
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:46,770
Oh, my gosh.

1896
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:47,490
Thank you.

1897
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:49,790
Thank you so much.

1898
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:50,990
I really appreciate it.

1899
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:55,330
Arigato…arigato…chew.

1900
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:00,050
This is supposed to be like the 팬� vermicelli with garbage.

1901
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:03,310
I don't know... for that.

1902
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:04,150
Thank you.

1903
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:18,630
Oh my gosh, we're gonna catch on fire like... soon.

1904
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:20,970
Soon, soon.

1905
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:22,910
Wait, can I take that candle now?

1906
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:23,410
Or...

1907
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:24,350
Open.

1908
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,400
Take candle.

1909
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:29,680
Candle.

1910
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,320
Light candle?

1911
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,180
Eat candle.

1912
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:39,360
Save.

1913
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,380
Okay, you guys are so...

1914
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,520
So big about me saving.

1915
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,280
Rolling for two.

1916
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,100
Oh, it's on, it's on, it's on!

1917
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,180
Okay, here we go.

1918
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:57,480
Wow, the horse grease on your robe caught fire!

1919
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:59,280
You're a four-wheel peasant now!

1920
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:01,940
Wait, but I'm still not stinky enough, right?

1921
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:03,900
Or am I?

1922
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,060
I mean, it said it smelled like my grandpa, so...

1923
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:09,600
Man, screens sure get light fast around here.

1924
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:13,520
Yeah, I'm just having your normal...

1925
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:15,920
Peasant day.

1926
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,280
I'm on fire.

1927
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:19,500
I'm...

1928
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:24,080
You know, do what... There's a lot of stuff that I don't have.

1929
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:27,420
This...

1930
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,340
There's a lot of stuff.

1931
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,020
Hmm.

1932
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,320
Hmm...

1933
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:44,530
What else am I missing besides the guy behind the tree?

1934
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:45,090
He looked naked.

1935
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:46,130
Talk.

1936
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:49,810
Go away, said Dongolev.

1937
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:53,210
We're arguing about who's hotter, as Mendeleev.

1938
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:56,630
Okay, I can settle this.

1939
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:09,350
Well, I can see that Dongleve has a very pronounced chin.

1940
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:13,250
That's already the signs of a Chad.

1941
01:25:13,730 --> 01:25:16,890
And he also speaks with confidence.

1942
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:21,630
Where Mendeleev is, you know, he's just kind of Eeyore.

1943
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:23,770
He's like, I'm so king.

1944
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:24,850
I'm sad.

1945
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:27,610
Mendeleev is hotter for sure.

1946
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:28,370
What?

1947
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:31,070
What are your credentials?

1948
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:43,060
Peasant day.

1949
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:45,560
Peasant time.

1950
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,040
Stop.

1951
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,700
Not the lane reference.

1952
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:54,700
And you don't seem to understand.

1953
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,740
I have a confidence.

1954
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,500
Whoa.

1955
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:01,220
I'm walking on top.

1956
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:03,420
I'm walking in my heart.

1957
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:04,720
Whoa.

1958
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:07,680
That's true.

1959
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,720
Sorry, my thatched roof cottage.

1960
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,200
Whoa.

1961
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,180
What am I missing?

1962
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,240
Talk.

1963
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:20,910
We're on fire.

1964
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:22,990
Set on fire.

1965
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:24,890
I can say anything set on fire.

1966
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:27,370
I can light anything on fire now.

1967
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:27,830
You guys.

1968
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:31,170
Ugh.

1969
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:31,970
Another level.

1970
01:26:34,050 --> 01:26:34,630
Hmm.

1971
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:38,790
Is there anything I can take?

1972
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:40,050
Look.

1973
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:42,310
Large hoof print.

1974
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:43,890
No Carrick mound.

1975
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:45,490
Hmm.

1976
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:48,970
Take shoes.

1977
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:51,370
Take.

1978
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:51,990
What is this?

1979
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:53,410
Is this a pants?

1980
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:54,330
Take pants.

1981
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:55,910
Take.

1982
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:58,670
He doesn't have a shirt on.

1983
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:01,230
Oh, it's a belt?

1984
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:03,530
Oh!

1985
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:07,430
You strapped the Carrick's belt buckle around your waist.

1986
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:08,090
Oh, boy.

1987
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:10,230
You sure stink now.

1988
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:12,810
Oh, my gosh.

1989
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:14,750
We smell?

1990
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:15,770
We smell?

1991
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:19,210
Oh, we got the Carrick belt.

1992
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:21,150
Phew.

1993
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:22,670
This thing stinks like...

1994
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:23,370
Oh, get out.

1995
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:28,650
Why couldn't the Carrick have kidnapped a hot wench or something that you could have saved?

1996
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:29,970
So true.

1997
01:27:30,430 --> 01:27:31,930
Give me the hot wench.

1998
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:32,950
I'm a peasant.

1999
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:34,510
And I'm gonna go kill Trogdor.

2000
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:36,470
And I'm gonna get a hot wench.

2001
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:37,410
For me.

2002
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:38,550
Myself only.

2003
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:40,510
I'm a peasant.

2004
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:42,870
But there's still so much that I don't have.

2005
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:45,330
Before we go face him.

2006
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:46,270
Face Trogdor.

2007
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:49,410
And also...

2008
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:49,650
Okay.

2009
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:49,950
Hold on.

2010
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:50,550
I have an idea.

2011
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:51,850
Because I do...

2012
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:57,510
Now that I have the robe on, maybe I can give the shirt to that guy.

2013
01:27:58,110 --> 01:27:58,630
Approve.

2014
01:27:58,650 --> 01:27:59,650
It's a proper peasant robe.

2015
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:04,390
It smells freshly washed and has the initials NN sewn onto the tag.

2016
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:06,130
NN.

2017
01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:13,810
Is there anyone in Homestar that has those initials?

2018
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:23,320
Homestar.

2019
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:27,500
Oh, wait.

2020
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:28,140
Look.

2021
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,180
Hey, come on out, buddy.

2022
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:33,420
Oh.

2023
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,060
No, no, no, no, no.

2024
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,240
Talk.

2025
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,060
Talk.

2026
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:40,220
Talk.

2027
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:40,800
Talk.

2028
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:42,580
How do I make him not disappear?

2029
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:47,600
I was once possibly, maybe, perhaps a chicken nugget.

2030
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:48,120
Thank you.

2031
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:51,240
Nice bowtie profile pic.

2032
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:57,840
Oh, give shirt instead.

2033
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:58,360
Okay.

2034
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:02,440
What's wrong with NN?

2035
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,220
Give shirt.

2036
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:06,360
You don't need to give that now.

2037
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:09,100
Give robe.

2038
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:11,240
Give shirt.

2039
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:13,120
Throw shirt.

2040
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,900
Gift shirt.

2041
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:21,040
Hide behind the tree.

2042
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:24,320
Give shirt.

2043
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,100
Drop shirt.

2044
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:29,840
Talk.

2045
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:36,220
Maybe I'm missing something.

2046
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,740
Does he need pants also?

2047
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:39,080
I don't know.

2048
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:41,620
Let's go back to the inn because it's daytime now.

2049
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:43,980
Let's go back.

2050
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,960
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

2051
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,880
Beedee, beedee, beedee, beedee.

2052
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:54,420
Open.

2053
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:57,440
Hello, mister.

2054
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,900
If you're interested in staying the night, just say, get a room.

2055
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:01,420
Get.

2056
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:03,940
Eh, eh?

2057
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:07,380
Eh?

2058
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:07,760
Eh, eh?

2059
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:08,300
Eh?

2060
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:25,370
It might have crashed.

2061
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:38,170
It popped right back up as I refreshed.

2062
01:30:39,790 --> 01:30:40,910
No way.

2063
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:44,050
Oh my goodness.

2064
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:45,350
Skip.

2065
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,530
Load.

2066
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:49,410
Load.

2067
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:53,610
We have to go back just a little bit.

2068
01:30:54,430 --> 01:30:55,150
Oh wait.

2069
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:55,750
Actually...

2070
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:56,530
Load.

2071
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:58,270
Oh here we go.

2072
01:30:58,350 --> 01:30:58,630
Load.

2073
01:30:58,930 --> 01:30:59,690
That's better.

2074
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:04,720
The auto-save is better.

2075
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:08,300
Sorry guys.

2076
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:11,920
So sorry for the inconvenience.

2077
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:13,720
Also this screen has nothing.

2078
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,860
We could have thrown the baby in here.

2079
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,080
Here too.

2080
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,440
No, we went to college.

2081
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:21,840
Do you have the belt?

2082
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:25,220
Yes.

2083
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:27,020
Yes, I do.

2084
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:31,640
Oh, open.

2085
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,240
I don't know why I typed inventory.

2086
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:44,650
Ord of peasant health says I can't serve any folk that's on fire.

2087
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:45,750
Nothing personal.

2088
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:48,250
Well, I mean, I don't like you much anyway.

2089
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,550
Because I'm on fire?

2090
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,350
You're discriminating against me?

2091
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:55,350
It's a pre-existing condition.

2092
01:31:56,190 --> 01:31:57,730
You can't do this to me.

2093
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:02,050
Please, I needed to sleep.

2094
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:08,790
So it's very personal.

2095
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:09,950
Yeah.

2096
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:11,690
Can I swim now?

2097
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:15,210
I don't know how to give that guy the shirt.

2098
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:16,930
Hmm.

2099
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:22,830
Let's go talk to the knight here, too.

2100
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:28,250
The one that's gatekeeping us.

2101
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:31,110
But I don't exactly want to go.

2102
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:32,690
We only have a score of 92.

2103
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:34,170
Talk.

2104
01:32:34,770 --> 01:32:35,930
Looking good, Mr. Peasant.

2105
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:38,050
Good luck with old beefy arm up there.

2106
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:40,530
This is it.

2107
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:42,430
You can finally get revenge on Trogdor.

2108
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:44,150
Nice work so far, stupid.

2109
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:46,090
Okay.

2110
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:48,290
But we have to get that guy.

2111
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,050
Now, welcome to membership.

2112
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:50,590
Thank you.

2113
01:32:57,810 --> 01:32:59,630
How can we give it to him?

2114
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:01,570
How can we?

2115
01:33:01,730 --> 01:33:02,810
I'm gonna give it to him.

2116
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:05,030
I'm gonna give it to him.

2117
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:10,250
I love that they call you stupid all the time.

2118
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:14,170
Hi,

2119
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:18,220
Mint.

2120
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:20,360
This is Trevor from Hampton, Maine.

2121
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:25,000
I was wondering if you could teach me to be as awesome as you.

2122
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:25,580
Ah!

2123
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:26,280
Sorry.

2124
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:27,560
You scared me.

2125
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:28,840
I am a vampire.

2126
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:29,840
And...

2127
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:30,760
Huh?

2128
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:35,080
And what?

2129
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:38,160
Melon, welcome to membership.

2130
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:38,800
Thank you.

2131
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:41,480
What do I do?

2132
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:42,320
What do I...

2133
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,380
Maybe I hide behind...

2134
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,560
Hide behind tree.

2135
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:48,620
I'm just gonna say hide.

2136
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:50,830
Hide.

2137
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:53,280
Um...

2138
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,360
Hide.

2139
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:00,040
Eeh?

2140
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,380
Can you whisper?

2141
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,360
Whisper.

2142
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:05,240
Um...

2143
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:12,870
Check my inventory.

2144
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:22,570
I feel like the hay would have been a good thing here.

2145
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:25,950
Um...

2146
01:34:25,950 --> 01:34:25,950
Hmm.

2147
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,540
Take off shirt.

2148
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:32,060
No.

2149
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,780
This guy needs my shirt!

2150
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,840
His nipples are so prominent!

2151
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:41,540
Look at them!

2152
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,240
Look at them!

2153
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,100
I thought they were eyeballs at first!

2154
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,020
Maybe this is not a human.

2155
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,160
Maybe this is actually a creature.

2156
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:52,200
These are his eyes.

2157
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:56,140
And this is like a cyst or something.

2158
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:00,280
You know...

2159
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,740
What do you mean another nipple hater?

2160
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,040
I'm not hating.

2161
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:07,940
I'm just saying.

2162
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:12,620
Wear mask.

2163
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:14,220
No.

2164
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,600
I can't tell what to do here.

2165
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,180
What to do here?

2166
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,280
He's gone!

2167
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:29,920
I scared him away.

2168
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:31,640
What?

2169
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,920
There are large hoof prints in the grass here.

2170
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:39,640
Looks like someone left their spare bones here.

2171
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,140
Take bones.

2172
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:44,100
No!

2173
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:47,920
No!

2174
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:52,400
I want the bones!

2175
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:55,620
I want the bones!

2176
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:57,980
What?

2177
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:00,600
Does anyone actually have a good idea?

2178
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,060
I was going to say an actual good idea.

2179
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:06,700
Does anyone, if you remember the game, want to give a hint?

2180
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:08,340
I can't remember.

2181
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,100
Talk tree?

2182
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:13,860
Talk tree.

2183
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:22,800
Trees can't talk, but a breeze picks up and you swear the leaves whisper in the words, Naked Ned!

2184
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,100
Naked Ned.

2185
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,420
Hey, Ned.

2186
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,020
Holdo.

2187
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:31,960
Oh.

2188
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:35,160
That's totally not Dongolev.

2189
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,900
And end.

2190
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:46,320
The trees are on something.

2191
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,540
Naked Ned.

2192
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:49,200
Naked Ned.

2193
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:51,800
Naked Ned.

2194
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:52,540
Naked Ned.

2195
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:53,300
Did you get along with the baby?

2196
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:54,220
Oh no!

2197
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:55,020
Really?

2198
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:57,240
Wait, like points?

2199
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:00,100
That's so sad.

2200
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:02,540
You have his robe.

2201
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,100
I know, but...

2202
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:04,460
Take off robe.

2203
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:06,800
Give robe.

2204
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:10,280
I have your robe.

2205
01:37:13,330 --> 01:37:14,400
Try talking to him.

2206
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:15,260
I'll show you what happens.

2207
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:18,160
You startle him and he disappears.

2208
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:25,440
Hmm...

2209
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:29,020
Hmm...

2210
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:31,380
Hmm...

2211
01:37:34,410 --> 01:37:35,150
Wavy... Oh!

2212
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:37,770
Talk to Naked Ned.

2213
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:42,410
Never speak of this meeting, says the nudie, and he disappears.

2214
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:55,280
Oh, talk Naked Ned gives a different name?

2215
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:02,940
Shirt doesn't do anything.

2216
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:03,680
Game facts.

2217
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:04,960
What the...

2218
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:07,860
Okay, we'll do talk Naked Ned instead of talk to...

2219
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:08,820
Okay, talk...

2220
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:10,760
Naked Ned.

2221
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:12,100
Nope.

2222
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,260
Same thing.

2223
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:13,880
Ah!

2224
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:16,380
What the...

2225
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,680
Hmm...

2226
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:18,780
Maybe I missed something.

2227
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:20,760
Hmm...

2228
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,680
Maybe I missed something.

2229
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:25,780
Hmm...

2230
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:26,840
Hmm...

2231
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:30,820
Hmm...

2232
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:36,230
He give...

2233
01:38:36,230 --> 01:38:37,430
Gave us hints for the robe.

2234
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:39,710
Use...

2235
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:40,370
Useless.

2236
01:38:41,710 --> 01:38:42,390
Oh!

2237
01:38:42,490 --> 01:38:44,490
Baby had two other tasks.

2238
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:47,570
Ohh...

2239
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:50,330
Oh...

2240
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,040
Baby had other tasks.

2241
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,240
Wait, where were they?

2242
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,500
Guess we gotta go beat Trogdor now then.

2243
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:05,400
Oh.

2244
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,260
Here I come.

2245
01:39:09,390 --> 01:39:10,450
Here I go.

2246
01:39:11,230 --> 01:39:13,950
Please insert floppy disk 2 into dragon.

2247
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:14,710
Can I be impressed?

2248
01:39:14,770 --> 01:39:15,250
Enter!

2249
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:29,170
There we go!

2250
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:30,970
Let's go!

2251
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:50,230
You'd best avoid thems.

2252
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:51,650
Okay.

2253
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:54,950
Goodness gracious!

2254
01:39:55,330 --> 01:39:58,250
You cannot go up and also...

2255
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:00,510
You have to like...

2256
01:40:02,230 --> 01:40:05,370
You cannot go up and sideways at the same time.

2257
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:07,050
Okay.

2258
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:09,230
We're just gonna go this way.

2259
01:40:10,190 --> 01:40:10,530
Alright.

2260
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:13,410
I'm gonna go scoot over a little maybe.

2261
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:15,110
Here we go everybody!

2262
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:16,710
We're gonna...

2263
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:20,350
We're gonna go beat Trogdor!

2264
01:40:20,670 --> 01:40:20,950
Oh!

2265
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:23,210
Nice job climbing the cliff.

2266
01:40:23,530 --> 01:40:25,470
You have a real way with those arrow keys.

2267
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:27,910
What a thrill!

2268
01:40:31,210 --> 01:40:31,730
Oh!

2269
01:40:31,730 --> 01:40:33,530
You do keep getting more points.

2270
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:34,250
Oh my gosh.

2271
01:40:34,530 --> 01:40:35,190
What's this?

2272
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:37,530
Oh!

2273
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,310
Foolish peasant!

2274
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:40,970
How dare you enter this fairly sacred chamber!

2275
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:44,610
You explained that you are here to smoke Trogdor.

2276
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:46,550
And if he doesn't get out of your way...

2277
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:47,330
Him too!

2278
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:50,350
I love Coach Z.

2279
01:40:50,650 --> 01:40:51,610
Great job!

2280
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:54,430
You cannot vanquish Trogdor.

2281
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:59,410
Only the three keepers of Trogdor hold the tools with which to destroy the Burninator.

2282
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:03,570
The Trog shield, the Trog helmet, and the Trog sword.

2283
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:11,250
And the only way we'll give them up is if you answer the three Trog trivia questions correctly.

2284
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:14,030
Oh!

2285
01:41:14,030 --> 01:41:17,930
Right here goes What does Mendeleev have you tell Dongalev?

2286
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:19,370
Hello everybody.

2287
01:41:19,650 --> 01:41:20,470
I mean not hello.

2288
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:22,270
Everybody.

2289
01:41:22,710 --> 01:41:23,990
Let's all say it together.

2290
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:30,700
America!

2291
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:32,320
Happy!

2292
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:39,350
No I'm just kidding.

2293
01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:39,650
It's A.

2294
01:41:41,150 --> 01:41:41,850
Oh crap.

2295
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:42,270
You're right.

2296
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,530
Here take this stupid Trog shield.

2297
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:47,490
America!

2298
01:41:50,570 --> 01:41:53,660
Hold peasant.

2299
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:56,700
You must answer the second dreaded Trog trivia question.

2300
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,040
Listen careful now.

2301
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:02,240
What was the innkeeper's pantry full of?

2302
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:04,580
I remember.

2303
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:06,680
Not Epson printers.

2304
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:08,640
Old man rub.

2305
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:11,040
That's right.

2306
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:11,840
Oh.

2307
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:13,100
This sucks.

2308
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:15,220
Because I have to give you this Trog helmet.

2309
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:16,580
Dang.

2310
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:19,500
And last.

2311
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:21,900
Oh.

2312
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,020
But not least.

2313
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:29,240
I thought they were all going to be color coded like their fancy dangles hair.

2314
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,060
Old man rub.

2315
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:34,460
Think you're pretty hot stuff eh?

2316
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:38,800
Let's see you answer the deadly and pretty impossible third Trog trivia question.

2317
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:40,640
Riddle me this.

2318
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:44,800
Which way does the river that runs through peasantry flow?

2319
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:57,380
North east to south west?

2320
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:57,400
West?

2321
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:00,660
Uh...

2322
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:02,280
I think... wait.

2323
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:04,540
I'm thinking of the...

2324
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:05,280
No.

2325
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,320
I'm thinking of the...

2326
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:07,780
What's the word?

2327
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:10,660
I'm thinking of the waterfall.

2328
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:17,050
Wait.

2329
01:43:17,070 --> 01:43:17,650
C you think?

2330
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:18,690
I think it's C right?

2331
01:43:20,190 --> 01:43:20,710
Yeah.

2332
01:43:20,790 --> 01:43:21,670
Maybe I am right.

2333
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:24,710
Pick number C my lord.

2334
01:43:26,710 --> 01:43:28,770
Pick number C mint.

2335
01:43:31,790 --> 01:43:32,270
Okay.

2336
01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:32,790
Let's try C.

2337
01:43:34,430 --> 01:43:34,910
Oh.

2338
01:43:34,930 --> 01:43:35,310
Oh.

2339
01:43:35,870 --> 01:43:36,530
Uh oh.

2340
01:43:36,670 --> 01:43:37,570
You got it right.

2341
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:39,170
Trogdor is going to kill me.

2342
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:40,070
Okay.

2343
01:43:40,290 --> 01:43:41,690
You can have the Trog sword.

2344
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:45,330
Just promise not to kill any Trogdors with it.

2345
01:43:45,390 --> 01:43:45,670
Okay?

2346
01:43:46,950 --> 01:43:49,910
You just stare at the keeper blankly.

2347
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:50,830
Okay.

2348
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:51,230
Fine.

2349
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:52,830
You can have the dumb thing anyway.

2350
01:43:53,190 --> 01:43:55,770
Trogdor is through the beaded curtain over there.

2351
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:58,490
The fabled Trog sword is yours.

2352
01:43:58,490 --> 01:44:01,470
Now you have the means to strike down Trogdor.

2353
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:03,530
Good luck peasant.

2354
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:06,370
Yeah.

2355
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:09,290
Look at me.

2356
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:15,810
We are still missing three things.

2357
01:44:16,270 --> 01:44:17,010
Oh four.

2358
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:17,710
Four things.

2359
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:19,190
How curious.

2360
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:22,150
Let's check out the Trog helmet.

2361
01:44:22,330 --> 01:44:24,390
The Trog helmet is not screwing around.

2362
01:44:24,710 --> 01:44:26,010
It's a serious helmet.

2363
01:44:26,230 --> 01:44:28,130
It also protects against harmful UV.

2364
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:32,050
Are you team Yukari sensei?

2365
01:44:32,050 --> 01:44:32,690
Or team Nyamo?

2366
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:34,630
We need to know.

2367
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:41,470
As a kid I was always more team Yukari sensei.

2368
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:51,720
Behold the Trog shield.

2369
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:52,740
No seriously.

2370
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:53,600
Behold it.

2371
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:56,800
There is no way Trogdor's fire breath can penetrate this thing.

2372
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:57,920
Yeah.

2373
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,000
The Trog sword is for real.

2374
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,480
Hands down the coolest item in this whole game.

2375
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:07,660
You can't wait to lop off that beefy arm of Trogdor's with this guy.

2376
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:08,900
Oh my gosh.

2377
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:10,100
Oh my gosh you guys.

2378
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:10,700
We are going to go do it.

2379
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:13,200
We are going to defeat Trogdor.

2380
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:15,640
This is it.

2381
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:17,100
This is it.

2382
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:20,080
Actually I don't remember what the...

2383
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,180
Is there a mini game?

2384
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,340
I actually don't remember what happens.

2385
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,360
So let's go.

2386
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,080
My ears.

2387
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:37,380
The beaded curtain slams shut behind you.

2388
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:39,220
There is no turning back now.

2389
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:41,380
Save.

2390
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:42,200
Oh.

2391
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:46,360
No turning back now you guys.

2392
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,080
Oh save.

2393
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:55,880
Maybe I should have had like a thing before I did the baby.

2394
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,660
Oh my gosh we are so small.

2395
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:03,360
Throw sword.

2396
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:05,540
This is it.

2397
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:09,460
You hurl the Trogsword with all your might at the sleeping Burninator.

2398
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:10,500
Oh.

2399
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:12,860
Oh.

2400
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:17,160
Wow.

2401
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:18,000
It's beefy.

2402
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:19,260
It looks like a cigarette.

2403
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,440
You shouldn't be smoking Trogdor.

2404
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:23,920
Now you've done it.

2405
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:26,860
Trogdor is awake and the Trogsword doesn't seem to be doing a whole lot.

2406
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:27,320
Oh no.

2407
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,600
Your legs lock in fear.

2408
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:38,740
Your eyes glaze over and you wish for some depeasant depeasant adult undergarments.

2409
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:42,100
But you think you hear Trogdor whimpering.

2410
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,660
Aw crap.

2411
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,320
That's you whimpering.

2412
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,440
At least your voice still works I guess.

2413
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:51,520
Uh.

2414
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:52,220
Talk.

2415
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:55,640
You scream that your name is rather dashing.

2416
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:59,320
And that Trogdor burned and ate your cottage and you're here for revenge.

2417
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:00,880
Submortal.

2418
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:09,220
I really appreciate you making the effort to come all the way up here and vanquish me.

2419
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:13,320
But I'm kind of indestructible.

2420
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:17,620
Mortis!

2421
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:19,540
Um.

2422
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:22,820
I will say that again for anyone who did not understand.

2423
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:23,700
Sup mortal.

2424
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:24,740
Booms Trogdor.

2425
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:28,940
I really appreciate you making all the effort to come all the way up here and vanquish me and all.

2426
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:30,960
But I'm kind of indestructible.

2427
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:31,600
Yeah.

2428
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:33,580
I can't be cute.

2429
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:38,120
I'm surprised no party mentioned that to you.

2430
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:40,980
This is terrifying.

2431
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:44,940
You've got it farther than anybody else ever has.

2432
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:51,300
I bet they'll make a statue or something in the corner of you somewhere.

2433
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:53,720
Rain of spiders!

2434
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:56,220
Yeah.

2435
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,640
I can't be killed.

2436
01:47:57,820 --> 01:47:59,600
I'm surprised nobody mentioned that to you.

2437
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:00,480
I'll admit though.

2438
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,000
You've gotten farther than anybody else has.

2439
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:06,960
I bet they'll make a statue or something in honor of you somewheres.

2440
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,500
Rain of Trogdors.

2441
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:20,820
I can honestly say it'll be a pleasure and an honor to burninate you, rather dashing.

2442
01:48:22,660 --> 01:48:24,580
That sure was nice of him.

2443
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:29,920
And I've been burninated.

2444
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,040
Congratulations.

2445
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,380
You've won!

2446
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:36,420
No one can kill Trogdor, but you came closer than anybody ever.

2447
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:38,500
Way to go!

2448
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:43,240
No!

2449
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:48,020
I wanted to 100% it.

2450
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,580
He's eating him.

2451
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:56,460
Then he's gonna eat me.

2452
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:57,100
Oh!

2453
01:48:57,320 --> 01:48:59,360
Oh my gosh, it's our statue!

2454
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:02,640
Nice work on winning and everything.

2455
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:03,660
Oh!

2456
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:06,600
Scalding Lake!

2457
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:18,580
134 out of 150 is so...

2458
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:20,760
Okay, that's it.

2459
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:23,140
Ah, so frustrating though.

2460
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:26,200
Ah, it's so frustrating not to get 150.

2461
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:29,080
The end.

2462
01:49:32,780 --> 01:49:33,240
Yippee!

2463
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:34,820
What a game.

2464
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:39,320
Look how rather dashing we are.

2465
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:43,900
Yeah, here is this statue as an honor of rather dashing.

2466
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:50,080
I expected him to have a bit more of like a Farquaad kind of haircut from his little sprite, you know?

2467
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:52,560
He seemed to have like a bit of a... a bit of a bob.

2468
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:54,460
A bob.

2469
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:55,600
Yeah.

2470
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:56,540
Hmm.

2471
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:00,000
How can AAA games compare?

2472
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:03,140
I think I found my new brain rot.

2473
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:08,580
I think I found my new brain rot with this.

2474
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:09,400
Um...

2475
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,560
I'm kind of a fan.

2476
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:16,340
Is this an old game or a new game made retro style?

2477
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:18,040
It's pretty old.

2478
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:20,060
It's pretty old.

2479
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:20,760
It's...

2480
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:24,300
It's not like as old as it seems though.

2481
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,180
It's... it's...

2482
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:27,820
It's like mid-2000s game.

2483
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:29,880
Right?

2484
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:32,740
Right?

2485
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:37,420
Circa 2004.

2486
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:39,400
That's what I meant.

2487
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:40,820
Like mid-2010.

2488
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:41,260
Right.

2489
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:41,480
Wait.

2490
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:43,780
2000 to 2010.

2491
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:46,220
So 2004 is almost in the middle.

2492
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:48,840
So 20 years.

2493
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:50,680
Yeah.

2494
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:52,280
Yeah.

2495
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:53,020
20...

2496
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:54,820
20 years old.

2497
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:55,580
This game is.

2498
01:50:57,020 --> 01:51:00,900
But it seems like it's supposed to be like 40 years old.

2499
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:01,180
You know?

2500
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:02,420
Hmm.

2501
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:06,080
It's an old parody of an even older genre.

2502
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:06,500
Exactly.

2503
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:08,000
Oh my gosh.

2504
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:09,020
Traktor!

2505
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:12,780
Thank you for the trip down memory lane.

2506
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:13,560
Traktor!

2507
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:15,220
Thank you!

2508
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:16,860
Hmm.

2509
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:18,860
Yeah.

2510
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:22,200
Sorry.

2511
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:28,560
When I say not too old, I mean compared to the style of game that it's emulating.

2512
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:30,620
Or that it's parodying.

2513
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:31,480
You know what I mean?

2514
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,720
It's not from the 80s or 90s or anything.

2515
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:39,420
So.

2516
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:40,520
Your head explode.

2517
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:42,360
Yeah.

2518
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:43,100
That was so fun.

2519
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:44,100
What a trip down memory lane.

2520
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:52,160
I... I almost want to speed run it to try and get the baby extra stuff but I'm kind of tired.

2521
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,460
I'll be honest.

2522
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,520
Today and yesterday were some couple of busy days with me haunting all over the place.

2523
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:03,700
Yeah.

2524
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:05,000
Spiderman!

2525
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:05,880
Oh.

2526
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:07,580
Sorry.

2527
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,240
I wish you were spiders, man.

2528
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:12,780
Welcome to membership.

2529
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:13,540
Thank you.

2530
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:17,600
Burninating the countryside.

2531
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:20,900
Burninating the people.

2532
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:22,480
Look, you guys.

2533
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:24,460
Metal Gear Solid is older than this.

2534
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:27,040
I think Zumbini's is also older than this.

2535
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:27,520
So...

2536
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:34,260
Cap fourth leg is like a house without a bonnet.

2537
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:39,700
Has to find the bill key to pen blue door.

2538
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:43,860
Oh my gosh.

2539
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:46,320
That's the yokel felon king I know and remember.

2540
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:49,960
It's crazy.

2541
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:56,560
They copied how back then they just copied how old DOS games and nowadays we get styles copying the PS1 wobble.

2542
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:57,540
What a time we live in.

2543
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:58,380
I know, right?

2544
01:52:58,580 --> 01:52:59,240
So funny.

2545
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:03,680
Though, there are some games that copy styles like this too sometimes.

2546
01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:05,040
Um...

2547
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,360
You know, indie game Dave the Diver.

2548
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:08,060
No, I'm just kidding.

2549
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:10,540
What was... like...

2550
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:13,480
Mortis.

2551
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:14,940
What is... Faith!

2552
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:17,540
Faith is pretty...

2553
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,200
You know?

2554
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:22,560
Uh...

2555
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:24,480
I don't...

2556
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,640
I don't think it's a very...

2557
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:27,380
I can't think of anything else though.

2558
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:28,400
I don't know.

2559
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:29,220
Undertale?

2560
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:37,950
Not really though.

2561
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:40,810
It's just like a pixel game.

2562
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:42,050
Right?

2563
01:53:42,150 --> 01:53:42,730
Movie time?

2564
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:43,870
What do you mean movie time?

2565
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:46,010
What's the movie time?

2566
01:53:47,970 --> 01:53:49,590
How do I get out of this?

2567
01:53:52,510 --> 01:53:53,090
Help.

2568
01:53:54,290 --> 01:53:54,870
Quit.

2569
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:55,450
Done.

2570
01:53:57,510 --> 01:54:02,790
Thanks for bringing clarity to me for a rep... to me for a reference that I never...

2571
01:54:03,930 --> 01:54:07,090
got to experience but only heard about it second hand.

2572
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:07,670
Also cute.

2573
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:08,890
Maid Ghost is cute.

2574
01:54:09,210 --> 01:54:10,270
Thanks Black Knight!

2575
01:54:10,590 --> 01:54:11,350
I'm glad that...

2576
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:13,130
There's a Peasant's Quest movie?

2577
01:54:13,830 --> 01:54:14,830
Wait, actually?

2578
01:54:15,690 --> 01:54:16,710
Hold on, I'm looking it up.

2579
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:20,150
Peasant's Quest movie.

2580
01:54:20,410 --> 01:54:28,250
Also don't google Peasant's Quest because there's apparently another game called Peasant's Quest that does not...

2581
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:34,710
It uh...

2582
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:38,980
It...

2583
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:40,920
It does not look friendly.

2584
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:42,640
Hold on.

2585
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:43,360
Oh movie trailer.

2586
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:45,740
It began.

2587
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:45,960
Oh!

2588
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:50,820
I think we can watch this.

2589
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:53,480
It's... hold on.

2590
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:55,240
Give me a second.

2591
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:58,280
How can I do this real quick?

2592
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:03,360
I'm gonna hide the Peasant's Quest.

2593
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:07,200
I'm gonna do this.

2594
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:10,660
Wait, can I put it here?

2595
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:11,540
Oh no I can't.

2596
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:12,040
Here we go.

2597
01:55:15,180 --> 01:55:15,760
Peasant's Quest.

2598
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:20,540
And then I can scoot it over.

2599
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:24,340
Like that.

2600
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:25,800
Okay.

2601
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:28,580
We're watching... we're gonna watch ye olde YouTube.

2602
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:33,100
We're watching ye olde YouTube everybody.

2603
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:34,720
Oh it's a little cut off.

2604
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:35,120
Hold on.

2605
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:38,720
Turn it down some too.

2606
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:41,060
I hope I don't get copyright struck like before.

2607
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:42,980
There we go.

2608
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:46,340
Okay.

2609
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:49,440
Um...

2610
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:51,160
Okay.

2611
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:58,220
It began as the best selling video computer TV game of all time.

2612
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:01,080
Not really.

2613
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:02,740
But still.

2614
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:03,420
Still.

2615
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:06,300
A simple peasant wearing short pants.

2616
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:06,900
I was him.

2617
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:07,080
I was him.

2618
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:09,240
Quested his way into the heart of a nation.

2619
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:15,020
Now for his greatest adventure yet, he will quest into theaters.

2620
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:18,140
Oh see that's what I imagined him to look like.

2621
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:20,040
Where's my cottage?

2622
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:21,360
Oh no.

2623
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:22,760
I got...

2624
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:25,800
Oh my god.

2625
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:26,060
Oh.

2626
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:26,520
Woah.

2627
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:27,300
Woah.

2628
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:28,120
Woah.

2629
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:29,120
Who is he fighting?

2630
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:32,140
I don't remember that part.

2631
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:33,780
Is that with the baby?

2632
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:38,820
Who is that?

2633
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:45,420
This is from 14 years ago you guys.

2634
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:48,960
Oh he's got a scalding leg.

2635
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:51,860
I like this couch.

2636
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:57,440
From the sort of people who brought you Trogdor and Litigation Jackson.

2637
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:58,580
Is that a real horse?

2638
01:56:58,580 --> 01:56:59,280
Easy now Gary.

2639
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,500
I'm just going to wear masks.

2640
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:04,960
Is that a real horse?

2641
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:07,240
Show me your real man, rather dashing.

2642
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:10,180
Throw baby.

2643
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:11,480
Throw baby!

2644
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:13,620
How do?

2645
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:15,700
I'm Mendeleff.

2646
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:16,600
I'm Dongleff.

2647
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:19,800
Rather dashing.

2648
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:23,420
More like rather homely.

2649
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:25,700
Woah.

2650
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:27,160
Hot dog.

2651
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:30,920
A Trogventure for the whole Trog family.

2652
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:33,440
They said they don't do lessons.

2653
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:35,560
They just hate me I guess.

2654
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:37,860
Oh I love Blue for Night.

2655
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:42,100
I'm just so mad at Trogdor.

2656
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:45,000
Access to Trogdor is strictly for peasants.

2657
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:46,820
He just goes around burning things.

2658
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:46,840
He doesn't even care.

2659
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,020
Why is it wiggling down here?

2660
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:50,520
You don't smell like a peasant.

2661
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:51,980
Ah!

2662
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:53,520
Oh my god!

2663
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:55,600
I killed that guy!

2664
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:57,740
Yeah!

2665
01:57:58,100 --> 01:57:59,800
Good thing we didn't watch this.

2666
01:57:59,860 --> 01:58:00,360
It's spoilers.

2667
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:04,220
I don't remember this part.

2668
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:06,240
Maybe I should have attacked him.

2669
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:12,700
Oh my god.

2670
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:14,780
Oh!

2671
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:16,700
What is that?

2672
01:58:17,060 --> 01:58:19,320
A quest for a peasant.

2673
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:21,480
A quest for a peasant.

2674
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:26,540
A quest for a peasant.

2675
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:26,640
Oh!

2676
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:28,040
My eyes!

2677
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:30,100
In the moon?

2678
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:36,570
And the Trogdor comes.

2679
01:58:38,270 --> 01:58:39,710
In the night.

2680
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:42,110
Not tonight he doesn't come.

2681
01:58:42,630 --> 01:58:44,170
In the night.

2682
01:58:45,650 --> 01:58:46,090
Trogdor.

2683
01:58:47,090 --> 01:58:47,970
Yeah!

2684
01:58:49,870 --> 01:58:50,610
Peasant's quest.

2685
01:58:50,810 --> 01:58:51,670
Peasant's quest.

2686
01:58:53,970 --> 01:58:56,970
I think I get it more now.

2687
01:58:57,150 --> 01:58:57,570
I think.

2688
01:59:00,450 --> 01:59:01,650
I think.

2689
01:59:02,030 --> 01:59:02,050
Thank you.

2690
01:59:02,310 --> 01:59:02,350
Thank you.

2691
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:06,210
The maid is grounded.

2692
01:59:09,190 --> 01:59:10,330
Strong bed?

2693
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:18,200
There was so much love in that video.

2694
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:23,620
I think the people that made Homestar probably had a lot of fun.

2695
01:59:23,860 --> 01:59:24,620
You know?

2696
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:27,700
They seemed like they just were goofy people.

2697
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:30,100
All around goofy people.

2698
01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:30,880
You know what I mean?

2699
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:34,500
Oh.

2700
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,760
You can see I'm on the Homestar website.

2701
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:40,340
That's it.

2702
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:43,600
That's it.

2703
01:59:43,740 --> 01:59:43,920
That's it everybody.

2704
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:55,140
I really wanted to 100% it but oh well.

2705
01:59:55,820 --> 01:59:56,720
I'm glad we watched the video.

2706
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:58,400
I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick.

2707
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:00,420
I'm going to go to the little ghosty's room.

2708
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:07,320
So you guys also get some something to drink and stretch or go to the bathroom.

2709
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:08,900
I'll be right back.

2710
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:11,720
I'll put on music at least.

2711
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:20,940
I will be right back.

2712
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:22,100
I'm

2713
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:09,180
back baby.

2714
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:12,120
I'm back baby.

2715
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:17,770
I'm from the dead.

2716
02:03:29,730 --> 02:03:32,790
Give me one second.

2717
02:03:33,070 --> 02:03:35,350
We'll move to my maid cafe.

2718
02:03:36,650 --> 02:03:38,010
And uh...

2719
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:39,470
Yeah.

2720
02:03:39,730 --> 02:03:41,310
We can talk.

2721
02:03:41,310 --> 02:03:41,870
Welcome back.

2722
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:42,650
I'm back.

2723
02:03:43,190 --> 02:03:48,370
I went and I saw my cat and he was laying on his back and looked really cute.

2724
02:03:48,590 --> 02:03:51,310
So I went on his tummy.

2725
02:03:53,910 --> 02:03:58,370
And then I kind of kissed him and I said Who's a healthy boy?

2726
02:03:58,950 --> 02:04:00,390
Who's a healthy boy?

2727
02:04:02,130 --> 02:04:02,730
Him.

2728
02:04:03,250 --> 02:04:04,630
He's a healthy boy.

2729
02:04:09,130 --> 02:04:15,230
Have I ever mentioned you have a pen chant for a pleasantly peasant quest for a pheasant?

2730
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:18,130
A what?

2731
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,240
I didn't understand a single word you said.

2732
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:29,020
I've been busy at work so a little late.

2733
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:29,800
No worries.

2734
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:30,880
Glad to hear your kitty's healthy.

2735
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:31,800
How old is the little guy?

2736
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:32,620
My kitty is 17.

2737
02:04:33,540 --> 02:04:36,000
You would never guess looking at him but he is definitely stinky.

2738
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:38,560
My cat's about like 13 so...

2739
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:42,680
Definitely not 17 of stink.

2740
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:45,260
17 age of stink.

2741
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:46,520
Penchant.

2742
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:47,720
Oh!

2743
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:48,620
A penchant!

2744
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:49,240
Penchant?

2745
02:04:49,340 --> 02:04:49,720
Like that?

2746
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:52,220
I was thinking like a chant.

2747
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:55,180
Like water game.

2748
02:04:58,260 --> 02:04:58,820
Oops.

2749
02:04:59,380 --> 02:05:01,760
That's what idle brain does to you I suppose.

2750
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:04,880
Thank you guys for all the donos while I was going potty.

2751
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:05,500
Thank you.

2752
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:08,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2753
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:11,640
Penchant.

2754
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:13,080
A penchant.

2755
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:15,240
I was just like...

2756
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:16,300
Let's see.

2757
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:18,660
I'm going to make a penchant right now.

2758
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:21,640
Ball.

2759
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:22,180
Pen.

2760
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:23,680
Quill.

2761
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:26,540
Fibo.

2762
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:28,640
Wipa.

2763
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:31,080
Inky.

2764
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:32,860
Inky.

2765
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:35,180
Inky, inky, inky.

2766
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:40,580
What's um...

2767
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:42,920
What's like the different sizes of a...

2768
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:44,340
You know.

2769
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:46,140
Um...

2770
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:48,240
Pen size.

2771
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:49,040
Like millimeter.

2772
02:05:49,180 --> 02:05:49,580
You know.

2773
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:53,040
Fine, medium, bold.

2774
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:54,480
Fine, medium, bold.

2775
02:05:54,740 --> 02:05:55,400
Yeah we can do that.

2776
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:58,280
Fine, medium, bold.

2777
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:01,100
Fine, medium, bold.

2778
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:02,900
Um...

2779
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,160
Fine, point.

2780
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:07,240
Quick drying.

2781
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:08,400
Clap.

2782
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:08,520
Clap.

2783
02:06:10,420 --> 02:06:10,900
Um...

2784
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:12,040
Rubber grip.

2785
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:13,260
Okay, let's try it real quick.

2786
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:16,680
Wait, maybe I should change the Fibo Wipa part though, right?

2787
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:17,440
Ball.

2788
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:17,720
Pen.

2789
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:18,140
Quill.

2790
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:19,200
Fibo Wipa.

2791
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:22,120
Inky, inky, inky, inky, inky.

2792
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:23,640
Fine, medium, bold.

2793
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:24,860
Fine, medium, bold.

2794
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:25,540
Fine, point.

2795
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:26,200
Quick drying.

2796
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:27,780
Rubber grip.

2797
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:33,560
0.7 millimeter.

2798
02:06:34,900 --> 02:06:38,500
Inky, inky, inky, inky.

2799
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:39,940
It kinda works.

2800
02:06:40,900 --> 02:06:43,700
I think I tripped over my words a little bit towards the end though.

2801
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:46,340
Inky, inky, inky, inky.

2802
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:46,660
Fine, point.

2803
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:47,380
Quick drying.

2804
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:49,780
Rubber grip.

2805
02:06:50,620 --> 02:06:53,020
Inky, inky, inky, inky.

2806
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:55,340
Inky, inky, inky, inky.

2807
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:56,680
Inky, inky, inky, inky.

2808
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:58,780
0.5.

2809
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:00,880
0.5.

2810
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:01,340
0.7.

2811
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:05,580
Rubber grip hits hard.

2812
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:08,480
It's a first draft.

2813
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:10,020
I think it's perfect the way it is.

2814
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:13,700
It's okay, but it's not your best work, boss.

2815
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:18,360
Wow, we have some real criticizers in the chat.

2816
02:07:19,660 --> 02:07:20,800
It's okay, I get it.

2817
02:07:20,980 --> 02:07:21,600
I get it.

2818
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:24,200
What if I go to Homestar Runner today?

2819
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:25,920
Their website?

2820
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:28,780
Wait, the main website is like...

2821
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:30,000
Oh, come on in.

2822
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:32,680
Wait, can I actually... What is Ruffle?

2823
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,800
Oh, at the bottom it says, what's this big play button, you ask?

2824
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:40,420
Well, Flash is all kinds of dead.

2825
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:43,320
But the amazing Ruffle project helps our cartoons live on.

2826
02:07:43,700 --> 02:07:50,160
Not every cartoon and game works perfectly just yet, so be patient and expect some jankiness here and there while we keep working.

2827
02:07:50,660 --> 02:07:51,600
That's so cute!

2828
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:54,660
Tough crowd.

2829
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:55,420
For real.

2830
02:07:57,680 --> 02:07:59,540
It's not easy making chance up.

2831
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:00,780
We've got a good knack for it.

2832
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:01,980
Thanks!

2833
02:08:03,860 --> 02:08:04,340
Wait.

2834
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:07,640
Hold on real quick.

2835
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:09,820
Hold on real quick.

2836
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:12,660
I want to make sure I say the right thing.

2837
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:16,040
Hold on.

2838
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:18,120
One second.

2839
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:24,920
Will you ever be playing the dangerous point and click game also on the Homestar Runner website?

2840
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:25,920
I don't know.

2841
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:29,420
I don't remember playing.

2842
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:32,620
This one I played because I played it a lot as a kid too.

2843
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:34,500
Um...

2844
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:36,520
But...

2845
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:40,980
I don't really remember uh...

2846
02:08:41,540 --> 02:08:42,720
the other ones.

2847
02:08:43,180 --> 02:08:43,700
So...

2848
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:45,960
I don't know if they work either.

2849
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:47,840
Like they said, not all their games work.

2850
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:54,700
My heart felt that chat.

2851
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:04,120
Did you beat it back then?

2852
02:09:04,220 --> 02:09:07,660
I don't remember beating it because I didn't... I feel like...

2853
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:10,980
I feel like Trogdor's voice would have traumatized me as a kid.

2854
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:12,600
And...

2855
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:14,880
I don't remember that.

2856
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:20,590
I don't remember that at all.

2857
02:09:23,870 --> 02:09:26,610
But I probably would have remembered that.

2858
02:09:27,230 --> 02:09:27,750
Right?

2859
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:27,970
I...

2860
02:09:30,130 --> 02:09:31,110
I don't know.

2861
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:32,810
I don't know.

2862
02:09:39,370 --> 02:09:41,090
I'm so sleepy.

2863
02:09:42,030 --> 02:09:42,990
You guys...

2864
02:09:43,970 --> 02:09:45,510
Yesterday I worked...

2865
02:09:45,510 --> 02:09:46,270
I did a ton.

2866
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:49,530
Essentially I like had a...

2867
02:09:49,530 --> 02:09:51,190
I made a... what's the word?

2868
02:09:51,390 --> 02:09:58,330
I made like a big calendar for Matara and I to work on future podcast episodes and scheduling them out.

2869
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:59,530
And scheduling some trips.

2870
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:01,410
And scheduling some other events.

2871
02:10:01,470 --> 02:10:02,730
And scheduling things like that.

2872
02:10:04,630 --> 02:10:05,310
And...

2873
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:08,790
So I worked on a bunch of that.

2874
02:10:09,030 --> 02:10:13,650
I worked on messaging some people for commissions on things.

2875
02:10:16,110 --> 02:10:16,790
And...

2876
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:19,630
Oh nice!

2877
02:10:20,130 --> 02:10:21,990
I was so organized.

2878
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:24,830
She loves to schedule.

2879
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:24,950
She loves to schedule.

2880
02:10:25,450 --> 02:10:27,750
She loves to schedule.

2881
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:30,780
Yeah.

2882
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:34,360
We have things we're cooking.

2883
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:42,020
I'm so glad you're indie.

2884
02:10:42,280 --> 02:10:42,480
I'm so glad you're indie.

2885
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:43,480
I'm so glad you're indie.

2886
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:48,320
I mean...

2887
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:49,320
I guess it is...

2888
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:51,240
I guess there is more freedom with it, right?

2889
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:53,640
Did you message Hena?

2890
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:54,820
I messaged her!

2891
02:10:55,820 --> 02:10:57,180
I said...

2892
02:10:57,180 --> 02:10:59,060
I said...

2893
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:00,700
I said...

2894
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:03,120
I said to her...

2895
02:11:03,120 --> 02:11:04,360
I said...

2896
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:05,840
I first...

2897
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:08,820
She sent me a waving emoji.

2898
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:11,520
And I sent a waving emoji.

2899
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:13,420
And she said, Hi people...

2900
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:15,560
People shy.

2901
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:18,280
And I said, Hi I'm a big fan of you.

2902
02:11:18,460 --> 02:11:20,960
LOL LOL LOL LOL

2903
02:11:30,070 --> 02:11:32,250
I said I'm a big fan of you.

2904
02:11:32,370 --> 02:11:32,590
LOL

2905
02:11:37,740 --> 02:11:39,120
Is it people shy?

2906
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:41,180
I don't know actually what's a people.

2907
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:43,860
I don't know which ones they are.

2908
02:11:44,020 --> 02:11:44,380
Hold on.

2909
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:47,000
People shy.

2910
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:48,400
Yeah!

2911
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:49,660
She sent a people shy.

2912
02:11:57,430 --> 02:11:59,330
LOL This one.

2913
02:12:00,370 --> 02:12:01,070
Hold on.

2914
02:12:02,050 --> 02:12:03,170
It's literally me.

2915
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:08,390
Me people shy.

2916
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:14,770
Yep.

2917
02:12:14,890 --> 02:12:16,450
Gotta hit her with the...

2918
02:12:16,450 --> 02:12:20,290
LOL I don't know.

2919
02:12:20,430 --> 02:12:22,070
Can I stick out my tongue to her?

2920
02:12:22,210 --> 02:12:23,510
Would that be considered weird?

2921
02:12:24,910 --> 02:12:26,090
I don't know.

2922
02:12:26,590 --> 02:12:27,490
What if I...

2923
02:12:28,610 --> 02:12:30,770
What if I just always talk with my tongue out?

2924
02:12:31,710 --> 02:12:34,350
What if I always talk with my tongue out?

2925
02:12:34,410 --> 02:12:34,970
And I...

2926
02:12:37,090 --> 02:12:39,530
Wait what cant I stream like this all time?

2927
02:12:39,870 --> 02:12:41,130
What do you think...

2928
02:12:43,690 --> 02:12:47,330
But if you keep watching it's like...

2929
02:12:47,330 --> 02:12:47,830
But if you keep watching it's like...

2930
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:50,590
If I stream like this....

2931
02:12:51,390 --> 02:12:52,130
If I stream like this...

2932
02:12:58,540 --> 02:13:04,820
You guys will have to grab my tongue and turn it on the table...

2933
02:13:04,820 --> 02:13:09,280
Grab my tongue and turn it on the table...

2934
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:09,860
Intimidation.

2935
02:13:22,620 --> 02:13:25,080
Sticking out your tongue for the...

2936
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:27,480
No!

2937
02:13:29,560 --> 02:13:30,800
No, they're not pants!

2938
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:32,760
It's not pants!

2939
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:36,420
It's my tongue!

2940
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:44,660
Wish I got to experience the early internet some more.

2941
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:45,740
No!

2942
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:48,760
I think the early internet...

2943
02:13:50,740 --> 02:13:51,900
I don't even know.

2944
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:53,740
There's definitely some weird stuff.

2945
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:55,960
I mean, there's always weird stuff, right?

2946
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:00,780
Homestar Runner was very pure, which is the best part about it.

2947
02:14:02,020 --> 02:14:03,880
People... Oh, Pepe and his son...

2948
02:14:07,340 --> 02:14:09,000
People is Pepe's son?

2949
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:12,280
Do you guys know that?

2950
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:14,200
Like, Pepe is so popular in Japan.

2951
02:14:14,540 --> 02:14:17,160
There's a whole section in Village Vanguard for...

2952
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:19,560
For Pe... Pe... Pe...

2953
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:21,980
Pe... Pe... Pe...

2954
02:14:21,980 --> 02:14:25,260
For him.

2955
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:29,480
Look, they sell a bunch of merch.

2956
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:30,500
Hold on.

2957
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:32,580
It's like this.

2958
02:14:32,700 --> 02:14:33,140
Hold on.

2959
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:36,220
Hold on.

2960
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:37,060
I got a picture.

2961
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:39,200
Like this.

2962
02:14:39,580 --> 02:14:40,620
Pepe the frog.

2963
02:14:42,280 --> 02:14:43,320
What is Pepe the frog?

2964
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:48,500
What is Pepe the frog?

2965
02:14:50,240 --> 02:14:52,080
Who is Pepe the frog?

2966
02:14:52,640 --> 02:14:53,480
Thank you, thank you.

2967
02:14:55,980 --> 02:14:58,220
Demonic Garmals, thank you so much for the 50!

2968
02:14:58,520 --> 02:14:59,200
Thank you!

2969
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:00,460
Thank you so, so much!

2970
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:01,840
Thank you!

2971
02:15:03,980 --> 02:15:04,420
Shoush!

2972
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:06,360
Hey, Mint, it's my birthday today!

2973
02:15:06,580 --> 02:15:10,060
I just wanted to send some love and appreciation to the silliest, goofiest...

2974
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:10,620
Wait, hold on.

2975
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:11,560
Let me get this out of my face.

2976
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:13,540
Ghost!

2977
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:16,860
If it's not too much to ask for, could I get a...

2978
02:15:16,860 --> 02:15:18,540
Birthday...

2979
02:15:18,540 --> 02:15:19,800
Birthday tongue?

2980
02:15:21,140 --> 02:15:25,400
Happy birthday to you.

2981
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:29,940
Happy birthday to you.

2982
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:34,900
Happy birthday dear Shoush.

2983
02:15:35,860 --> 02:15:40,940
Happy birthday to you.

2984
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:45,120
Happy birthday!

2985
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:50,880
Happy birthday!

2986
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:50,880
Yay!

2987
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:52,440
Happy birthday.

2988
02:15:52,930 --> 02:15:54,420
I'm assuming that's what you meant.

2989
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:57,340
I sure... I sure hope so.

2990
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:04,000
I sure hope so.

2991
02:16:08,030 --> 02:16:09,800
Now lick the candles.

2992
02:16:13,120 --> 02:16:13,720
Ooh!

2993
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:15,960
This was fun, guys!

2994
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:18,420
Sorry, that...

2995
02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:19,260
I feel like...

2996
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:21,820
This week I don't have so much planned.

2997
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:25,380
It's only like my second week back, but...

2998
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:26,960
Um.

2999
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:30,300
And I'm already just like...

3000
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:30,800
I'm...

3001
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:32,660
I'm tired, no.

3002
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:35,020
But you know, I'm all ready.

3003
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:38,000
Since I kinda kinda came back, the...

3004
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:38,400
Um.

3005
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:41,320
The day after I came back was...

3006
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:42,260
When we announced the...

3007
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:58,080
So, since then, there was a lot of stuff that I needed to take care of and I was like, okay, I should probably take care of some of this stuff before I get too deep into things a little bit... a little.

3008
02:17:03,420 --> 02:17:04,820
Yeah, but it's okay.

3009
02:17:06,200 --> 02:17:10,900
Like, just some like... housekeeping, you know?

3010
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:12,340
Housekeeping!

3011
02:17:15,620 --> 02:17:18,180
You kinda dropped on us from heaven.

3012
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:18,780
I know!

3013
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:21,340
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3014
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:24,580
But I'm still planning lots of stuff.

3015
02:17:27,360 --> 02:17:28,640
And... yeah.

3016
02:17:30,220 --> 02:17:34,600
We can have fun with the podcast happening too!

3017
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:36,140
Yippee!

3018
02:17:37,320 --> 02:17:38,860
It's only been two weeks.

3019
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:39,460
I know, right?

3020
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:42,680
It feels like so much longer for even me.

3021
02:17:42,860 --> 02:17:47,180
But I was like looking... I was like, okay, alright, time to make my schedule yesterday.

3022
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:52,320
And then when I was posting it, the post that I made before was like, first schedule!

3023
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:56,820
And I was like... first schedule?

3024
02:17:59,040 --> 02:17:59,880
What do you mean?

3025
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:01,620
I'm only making my second schedule.

3026
02:18:06,140 --> 02:18:07,660
Professional maid housekeeping.

3027
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:09,040
Yeah.

3028
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:09,280
Yeah!

3029
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:11,900
Yeah!

3030
02:18:12,770 --> 02:18:13,920
Podcast is super fun.

3031
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:15,180
I've been loving every episode.

3032
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:16,980
I think...

3033
02:18:17,980 --> 02:18:23,580
Um... we... well, last night when I was doing the planning, I think I decided...

3034
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:26,380
Or rather, I decided maybe...

3035
02:18:27,380 --> 02:18:30,300
A good day to end the podcast?

3036
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:33,080
Um... but...

3037
02:18:33,790 --> 02:18:36,160
I still need to talk about it with Matara.

3038
02:18:37,320 --> 02:18:37,760
Mmm...

3039
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:40,180
Which is already so sad to think.

3040
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:41,100
I don't want to think about it.

3041
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:43,240
Because...

3042
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:44,560
Yeah...

3043
02:18:45,480 --> 02:18:47,980
Even though... well, the podcast for me also...

3044
02:18:47,980 --> 02:18:49,760
It feels different than...

3045
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:52,420
How do I say?

3046
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:58,740
Like, for me, like obviously it's different than normal streaming, but like...

3047
02:18:59,460 --> 02:19:02,320
It's weird because when I stream... I don't know.

3048
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:05,720
I feel like maybe half of my brain is turned off.

3049
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:07,820
When I stream...

3050
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:11,520
But with the podcast, I feel like my brain has to be like...

3051
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:12,480
Totally on.

3052
02:19:14,940 --> 02:19:15,800
Hear me out.

3053
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:16,960
What if you don't end it?

3054
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:17,480
No...

3055
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:19,280
We gotta end... it's... you know...

3056
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:21,540
It's a summer podcast, you guys.

3057
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:26,080
It's a summer podcast.

3058
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:30,880
But that's okay.

3059
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:31,880
You'll have...

3060
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:33,440
You'll have... um...

3061
02:19:34,050 --> 02:19:36,740
You'll have lots of... lots and lots of more episodes, so...

3062
02:19:37,720 --> 02:19:39,100
Um... stream nerf.

3063
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:42,420
But yeah, since my brain is like on...

3064
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:46,680
For... like 100% or at least what it feels like.

3065
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:47,920
It's supposed to be 100%.

3066
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:50,240
Um... during it, like it...

3067
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:52,860
It actually does kind of like wear me out a little bit more.

3068
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:53,680
Which I didn't expect.

3069
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:54,520
I was like, oh my gosh.

3070
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:56,860
It's just talking for like a couple hours.

3071
02:19:57,020 --> 02:19:57,900
Like no biggie.

3072
02:19:59,360 --> 02:19:59,760
But...

3073
02:20:00,300 --> 02:20:02,200
Maybe I'm just... because you know...

3074
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:04,960
Uh... it's been so long since I've streamed.

3075
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:05,660
I...

3076
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:07,880
Have no stamina anymore.

3077
02:20:09,460 --> 02:20:11,380
I have no stamina anymore.

3078
02:20:13,360 --> 02:20:15,840
Will you still collab with... in the future with Matara?

3079
02:20:15,940 --> 02:20:16,460
Yeah, yeah.

3080
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:17,020
Of course.

3081
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:21,720
So...

3082
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:24,120
Podcast turns into collab.

3083
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:30,980
Y'all are very... on very high grade yap mode.

3084
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:35,620
It's gotta end someday so that we get the fall and winter Matara.

3085
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:36,700
Mentora podcast!

3086
02:20:37,140 --> 02:20:37,580
No!

3087
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:44,840
But... but I think...

3088
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:47,020
Because I'm just like, oh my gosh.

3089
02:20:47,060 --> 02:20:48,420
This is like kind of wearing me out.

3090
02:20:48,580 --> 02:20:51,920
Maybe also because like Matara is such an extrovert.

3091
02:20:52,020 --> 02:20:52,800
And for me...

3092
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:55,440
Like... when I talk to you guys...

3093
02:20:55,440 --> 02:20:57,640
Like I still can feel like I'm an introvert.

3094
02:20:57,680 --> 02:20:59,520
Because I just see you guys' texts.

3095
02:21:01,880 --> 02:21:04,260
But with her I have to have an actual conversation.

3096
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:05,640
But with her I have to have an actual conversation.

3097
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:05,720
So...

3098
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:07,700
My battery just goes...

3099
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:10,500
So quickly.

3100
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:13,800
It's something that I've like...

3101
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:14,840
Kind of been like...

3102
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:17,980
Self-aware of with the podcast.

3103
02:21:18,060 --> 02:21:18,860
I'm like, oh my gosh.

3104
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:20,340
By the end I start to like...

3105
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:22,220
I feel like I start to get kind of...

3106
02:21:24,060 --> 02:21:24,540
Tired.

3107
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:25,360
I need to...

3108
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:29,140
I need to work on that for future episodes.

3109
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:30,220
So like...

3110
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:33,980
I wanna say lately I've been...

3111
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:34,940
Trying...

3112
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:35,980
Collecting more...

3113
02:21:35,980 --> 02:21:37,140
Ace Combat Merch.

3114
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:38,360
Although the shipping is kind of expensive.

3115
02:21:38,380 --> 02:21:39,340
Because they're mostly in Japan.

3116
02:21:40,380 --> 02:21:42,240
Shipping from Japan is so expensive.

3117
02:21:42,280 --> 02:21:42,960
But good luck now.

3118
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:43,560
Good luck.

3119
02:21:44,860 --> 02:21:47,460
Podcast in winter because it's summer down south.

3120
02:21:48,100 --> 02:21:48,900
That's true.

3121
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:50,520
That's true.

3122
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:53,080
Yeah.

3123
02:21:59,340 --> 02:22:00,480
But it's not that I...

3124
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:02,820
I'm still definitely of course having fun with it.

3125
02:22:03,220 --> 02:22:04,160
It's just...

3126
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:05,940
A different experience for me.

3127
02:22:05,980 --> 02:22:07,020
Something that I didn't expect.

3128
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:08,780
Because I thought it would be so easy.

3129
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:10,260
But...

3130
02:22:10,260 --> 02:22:12,140
Not that I'm complaining or anything.

3131
02:22:12,440 --> 02:22:12,880
Oh my gosh.

3132
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:15,080
Being a content creator...

3133
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:16,200
Is so...

3134
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:16,800
Difficult.

3135
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:17,400
You're just...

3136
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:18,400
You...

3137
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:19,100
You peasant.

3138
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:20,140
You just never understand.

3139
02:22:20,220 --> 02:22:20,720
Now go...

3140
02:22:20,720 --> 02:22:22,380
Go and destroy Trogdor.

3141
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:26,540
Yeah.

3142
02:22:28,060 --> 02:22:29,560
Special Aussie episode.

3143
02:22:33,820 --> 02:22:35,900
Socially battery depleted.

3144
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:37,700
My battery.

3145
02:22:37,700 --> 02:22:42,820
Maybe that's what's making me so tired all the time.

3146
02:22:43,220 --> 02:22:43,540
No.

3147
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:45,140
I had a bad dream last night.

3148
02:22:45,220 --> 02:22:45,660
Oh my gosh.

3149
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:47,120
Oh.

3150
02:22:47,980 --> 02:22:50,520
I think it's because I fell asleep listening to...

3151
02:22:53,060 --> 02:22:57,440
Listening to like one of those ghost hunting YouTube channels or whatever.

3152
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,260
There's this one that I...

3153
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:01,800
There's like...

3154
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:04,260
I love the ones that are so dramatic.

3155
02:23:04,860 --> 02:23:05,820
About everything.

3156
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:07,400
Because it just is so funny.

3157
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:09,520
Where...

3158
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:10,820
First of all, it's just like...

3159
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:11,140
Oh my gosh.

3160
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:12,720
You're doing that to a ghost?

3161
02:23:12,820 --> 02:23:13,220
Like...

3162
02:23:13,220 --> 02:23:15,700
A ghost is never gonna respond to that.

3163
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:16,240
You know?

3164
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:19,640
But...

3165
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:22,780
But...

3166
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:24,260
You know.

3167
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:24,780
As a ghost.

3168
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:25,360
Of course.

3169
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:26,180
I would know.

3170
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:27,900
But yeah.

3171
02:23:27,980 --> 02:23:29,240
They're always so goofy.

3172
02:23:29,580 --> 02:23:31,120
They're just like...

3173
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:32,480
It's...

3174
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:32,820
Yeah.

3175
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:33,620
I don't know.

3176
02:23:36,140 --> 02:23:37,240
What's the one that I've...

3177
02:23:37,240 --> 02:23:37,380
What's the one that I've...

3178
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:37,980
What is their name?

3179
02:23:40,100 --> 02:23:41,520
They had a TV show.

3180
02:23:51,480 --> 02:23:54,500
I saw a Metal Gear Facts to Fall Asleep 2 video.

3181
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:55,720
I was going to try tonight.

3182
02:23:56,140 --> 02:23:57,060
You should.

3183
02:23:57,480 --> 02:23:58,580
I'm a person...

3184
02:23:58,580 --> 02:23:59,080
I...

3185
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:00,420
For the past couple of nights...

3186
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:01,700
I haven't been able to sleep well.

3187
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:03,040
I was trying to...

3188
02:24:04,620 --> 02:24:07,460
Fall asleep to like head scratching ASMR.

3189
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:10,040
But it just wasn't working.

3190
02:24:10,340 --> 02:24:12,220
I fall asleep so much better to...

3191
02:24:12,220 --> 02:24:15,620
Just mundane person talking videos.

3192
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,380
With Shane and Ryan?

3193
02:24:19,580 --> 02:24:19,760
No.

3194
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:20,660
I love them.

3195
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:24,000
I love Shane and Ryan.

3196
02:24:24,380 --> 02:24:24,900
Ghost Adventures?

3197
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:25,240
No.

3198
02:24:25,380 --> 02:24:25,860
It's a...

3199
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:27,660
It's a...

3200
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:28,040
It's a...

3201
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:29,100
It's a YouTube channel.

3202
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:30,580
Project Fear.

3203
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,080
I remembered it.

3204
02:24:32,120 --> 02:24:32,820
Project Fear.

3205
02:24:33,080 --> 02:24:33,640
They are...

3206
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:34,940
If you want some like...

3207
02:24:34,940 --> 02:24:39,820
Trash TV-esque ghost hunting YouTube content...

3208
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:42,120
They are...

3209
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:44,540
It's one of those like...

3210
02:24:45,020 --> 02:24:46,760
Like every video they'll be like...

3211
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:50,520
This is the craziest night we have ever had.

3212
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,060
History channels are my sleep channels.

3213
02:24:54,480 --> 02:24:55,800
Do you dream of aliens?

3214
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:58,260
Do you dream of getting probed?

3215
02:24:59,040 --> 02:24:59,560
Wow.

3216
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:02,100
Have you tried rambling videos?

3217
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:05,100
What's a ramble?

3218
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:05,560
What do you mean?

3219
02:25:05,900 --> 02:25:07,860
Just people rambling about stuff?

3220
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:14,420
Are you a Shaniac or a Bugara?

3221
02:25:14,740 --> 02:25:15,920
I'm a Shaniac.

3222
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:17,000
All the way.

3223
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:18,440
Even though...

3224
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:22,440
Even though I'm a ghost and I appreciate that...

3225
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:24,060
That...

3226
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:25,300
Oh gosh.

3227
02:25:25,460 --> 02:25:25,640
What's...

3228
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:30,020
That Ryan believes in ghosts and Shane doesn't believe in me and that's okay.

3229
02:25:30,580 --> 02:25:31,160
You know?

3230
02:25:31,180 --> 02:25:31,680
It's not like...

3231
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:32,120
If someone...

3232
02:25:32,120 --> 02:25:32,560
You know?

3233
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:37,120
If someone doesn't believe in me, it's not like I'm gonna die again, you know?

3234
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:38,100
Or cease to exist.

3235
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:39,700
I'm not like other...

3236
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:39,980
You know?

3237
02:25:39,980 --> 02:25:45,900
I'm not like other creatures where like if someone doesn't believe in you, like they like fade out of existence, you know what I mean?

3238
02:25:46,020 --> 02:25:46,620
But...

3239
02:25:47,700 --> 02:25:49,540
So for me, it doesn't matter if...

3240
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:51,820
If Shane doesn't believe in ghosts.

3241
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:53,360
I just think he's funny.

3242
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:55,860
Go team Shaniac!

3243
02:25:55,980 --> 02:25:56,980
Shaniac hype!

3244
02:25:57,160 --> 02:25:57,640
Yeah!

3245
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:03,440
Wait, you exist?

3246
02:26:12,330 --> 02:26:13,110
Do what?

3247
02:26:15,090 --> 02:26:15,370
Hmm.

3248
02:26:16,830 --> 02:26:17,990
You mean like a fairy?

3249
02:26:18,190 --> 02:26:18,450
Yeah!

3250
02:26:18,570 --> 02:26:18,870
Yeah!

3251
02:26:18,950 --> 02:26:19,150
Yeah!

3252
02:26:20,550 --> 02:26:22,210
Those things are so weak.

3253
02:26:23,250 --> 02:26:23,710
What?

3254
02:26:23,790 --> 02:26:25,930
Two people don't believe in you and you can't fly anymore?

3255
02:26:26,630 --> 02:26:27,090
So...

3256
02:26:27,090 --> 02:26:28,110
Come on.

3257
02:26:28,610 --> 02:26:29,070
Get...

3258
02:26:29,070 --> 02:26:30,510
You need to adopt a better...

3259
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:33,530
A better policy about your existence, you know?

3260
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:43,060
It's okay, we believe in you.

3261
02:26:44,480 --> 02:26:47,020
I don't care if you do or don't.

3262
02:26:47,660 --> 02:26:48,880
Doesn't mean anything to me.

3263
02:26:50,220 --> 02:26:51,140
I don't care if you do or don't.

3264
02:26:52,260 --> 02:26:53,380
The weakest!

3265
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:54,680
The weakest!

3266
02:26:56,340 --> 02:26:57,380
The weakest!

3267
02:26:57,580 --> 02:26:59,260
Hey, one of my former Oshis was a fairy?

3268
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:02,460
Sorry.

3269
02:27:02,780 --> 02:27:04,740
I don't mean to Oshi slander.

3270
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:08,320
I don't mean the Oshi slander, my bad.

3271
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:10,620
Sorry, I apologize.

3272
02:27:11,860 --> 02:27:13,740
Not to your Oshi, to you.

3273
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:19,440
I did not mean to Oshi slander.

3274
02:27:19,440 --> 02:27:24,180
I said I do.oni Yeah, get rekt chat.

3275
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:29,320
Also, you don't need wings to fly as a ghost.

3276
02:27:30,840 --> 02:27:32,840
Speaking of... well, it's not flying.

3277
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:33,740
It's more like floating.

3278
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:35,980
But I got a new desk.

3279
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:38,000
I got a standing desk.

3280
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:41,480
But I've been calling it a floating desk.

3281
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:45,700
I got a floating desk for myself.

3282
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:49,420
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna be so healthy.

3283
02:27:50,720 --> 02:27:52,740
So you're saying you could beat up a fairy.

3284
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:53,500
Yeah, probably.

3285
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:55,340
Why not?

3286
02:28:01,020 --> 02:28:01,460
Yeah...

3287
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:04,760
I've been trying to... because...

3288
02:28:05,640 --> 02:28:06,080
Because...

3289
02:28:07,580 --> 02:28:08,920
Can I mention this?

3290
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:09,800
You know what?

3291
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:11,160
She mentions things all the time.

3292
02:28:11,380 --> 02:28:12,680
It's probably fine if I mention this.

3293
02:28:12,900 --> 02:28:14,520
Actually, I think it was already mentioned before.

3294
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:18,360
Because I know that Matara is wanting to come visit...

3295
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:18,440
Yeah!

3296
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:19,820
We mentioned it.

3297
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:22,680
Because I asked if she wanted to play my Apache slot machine.

3298
02:28:22,900 --> 02:28:28,940
Because Matara is planning on visiting me, I've been reorganizing the maid cafe a little bit.

3299
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:31,640
I was just like...

3300
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:35,340
Oh gosh, maybe this doesn't look so awesome.

3301
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:38,820
Maybe I gotta reorganize just a little bit.

3302
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:43,600
So...

3303
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:46,720
That was part of what I've been doing this week.

3304
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:51,780
But also, I've been cleaning and reorganizing for another reason.

3305
02:28:52,900 --> 02:28:53,300
Good day...

3306
02:28:55,760 --> 02:29:00,560
First thing you need to get to go to your standing desk is a tall chair.

3307
02:29:02,240 --> 02:29:02,800
No!

3308
02:29:03,740 --> 02:29:04,940
Defeast the purpose!

3309
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:08,660
No...

3310
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:13,500
It's so soon?

3311
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:15,680
Hmm...

3312
02:29:16,900 --> 02:29:18,480
I'm not gonna say what.

3313
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:20,040
Don't say it.

3314
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:22,240
Don't say it.

3315
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:23,880
Don't say it.

3316
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:25,260
Don't say it.

3317
02:29:25,660 --> 02:29:28,180
She needs to hide her lewd snake doggies.

3318
02:29:28,300 --> 02:29:30,960
Hey, if you can show me where to get those...

3319
02:29:31,940 --> 02:29:34,100
Then I will need to hide them.

3320
02:29:37,560 --> 02:29:38,480
3D stream?

3321
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:39,000
No.

3322
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:41,720
No, no, no.

3323
02:29:41,780 --> 02:29:42,900
Not anything like that.

3324
02:29:47,860 --> 02:29:50,740
I... I... I... I...

3325
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:55,420
I don't even know how long I'll be around for, you know?

3326
02:29:58,940 --> 02:30:00,300
So... 3D stream...

3327
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:01,500
We'll see.

3328
02:30:01,560 --> 02:30:01,820
We'll see.

3329
02:30:02,100 --> 02:30:02,600
We'll see.

3330
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:02,780
We'll see.

3331
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:07,760
I'd like to though.

3332
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:10,160
It'd be really fun to...

3333
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:12,440
What are you guys saying?

3334
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:19,100
Is that what you want?

3335
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:24,240
Oh my gosh, lewd.

3336
02:30:24,360 --> 02:30:26,600
You could do the funniest thing right now.

3337
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:28,240
Lewd.

3338
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:29,200
Lewd.

3339
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:29,900
You could do...

3340
02:30:30,980 --> 02:30:32,560
The funniest thing right now.

3341
02:30:32,660 --> 02:30:35,180
If you make just one, I'll buy it at Ofgine.

3342
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:38,780
If you make just one...

3343
02:30:38,780 --> 02:30:42,440
I'll roll up to you in my little robot tablet...

3344
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:45,060
And I'll buy it from your booth.

3345
02:30:50,380 --> 02:30:50,980
Just one.

3346
02:30:56,620 --> 02:30:58,960
I know that's not how orders work.

3347
02:31:00,840 --> 02:31:01,500
I know.

3348
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:05,960
It's like, oh my gosh, I have to order 50 for it to be even worth it, but...

3349
02:31:05,960 --> 02:31:06,980
It's okay.

3350
02:31:07,060 --> 02:31:08,740
You can put a higher price tag on it.

3351
02:31:09,100 --> 02:31:10,020
I'll still buy it.

3352
02:31:10,180 --> 02:31:13,080
I know they're like... I've seen ones exist, but...

3353
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:15,440
Imagine my own personal one.

3354
02:31:15,620 --> 02:31:16,500
That'd be crazy.

3355
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:22,620
Yes.

3356
02:31:23,320 --> 02:31:23,920
Mine.

3357
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:24,780
Me.

3358
02:31:24,980 --> 02:31:25,500
Mine.

3359
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:25,880
Mine.

3360
02:31:26,820 --> 02:31:28,220
Gonna cost $300.

3361
02:31:36,570 --> 02:31:37,170
Worth.

3362
02:31:37,530 --> 02:31:37,890
Maybe.

3363
02:31:38,170 --> 02:31:39,970
Just order one sample, Lewd.

3364
02:31:40,170 --> 02:31:40,670
You could do...

3365
02:31:40,670 --> 02:31:43,130
Oh, you're so big-brained.

3366
02:31:43,270 --> 02:31:45,170
Just order it as a sample.

3367
02:31:45,170 --> 02:31:45,730
Exactly.

3368
02:31:45,850 --> 02:31:46,870
It doesn't need to be perfect.

3369
02:31:47,250 --> 02:31:48,470
Just order the sample.

3370
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:53,760
That's so genius.

3371
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:55,880
Oh my gosh.

3372
02:31:58,660 --> 02:31:59,920
That's so smart.

3373
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:08,500
Of course, of course, the vendors would all have all the knowledge, you know?

3374
02:32:08,780 --> 02:32:10,080
Yeah, it's just a sample.

3375
02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:12,320
It's not for sale, except to me.

3376
02:32:14,460 --> 02:32:16,880
This is my official commission.

3377
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:27,640
Okay.

3378
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:29,060
See you at...

3379
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:30,720
At...

3380
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:31,320
At...

3381
02:32:33,740 --> 02:32:34,820
Off-Kai.

3382
02:32:40,400 --> 02:32:41,120
Yes.

3383
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:44,100
Hacking the system.

3384
02:32:46,820 --> 02:32:47,540
Yes.

3385
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:49,400
Yes.

3386
02:32:50,140 --> 02:32:52,800
Big boss on one side and solid on the other.

3387
02:32:54,200 --> 02:32:54,920
No.

3388
02:32:55,540 --> 02:32:56,780
Double Plissken.

3389
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:00,240
Double Plisken.

3390
02:33:00,240 --> 02:33:01,780
Double pliskin!

3391
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,760
Can't wait for all the mint fan merch.

3392
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:04,960
It's so...

3393
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:09,880
I see people posting like I made a mint keychain!

3394
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:10,600
Or...

3395
02:33:12,280 --> 02:33:13,560
I saw...

3396
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:18,240
I saw a mockup of a mint plushie and I'm just like...

3397
02:33:19,740 --> 02:33:20,760
It's crazy!

3398
02:33:21,180 --> 02:33:22,360
It's actually crazy!

3399
02:33:22,740 --> 02:33:23,120
I...

3400
02:33:24,180 --> 02:33:25,900
never would have thunk...

3401
02:33:25,900 --> 02:33:29,120
I never would have thought, you know?

3402
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:30,180
Wow!

3403
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:30,900
Thank you!

3404
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:41,380
Can't just have it out in the world flopping out like that.

3405
02:33:41,720 --> 02:33:42,840
Actually messed up.

3406
02:33:45,980 --> 02:33:47,160
I get it.

3407
02:33:47,240 --> 02:33:47,600
I know.

3408
02:33:47,700 --> 02:33:50,520
It's a power that I must handle responsibly.

3409
02:33:52,740 --> 02:33:53,500
Thank you!

3410
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:56,880
It's always summer down here so it never ends, right?

3411
02:33:59,460 --> 02:33:59,900
Hmm...

3412
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:03,180
You're a bit of a celebrity boss?

3413
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:04,340
No!

3414
02:34:05,940 --> 02:34:06,380
No!

3415
02:34:08,500 --> 02:34:08,940
No!

3416
02:34:11,400 --> 02:34:12,740
I'm just little old me.

3417
02:34:14,960 --> 02:34:16,200
Must have been backlogged.

3418
02:34:16,220 --> 02:34:18,100
I think some of them are backlogged a little bit.

3419
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:18,300
Yeah.

3420
02:34:19,940 --> 02:34:22,680
Well, I have to change the notifs because I can't read them.

3421
02:34:22,860 --> 02:34:23,820
Look how tiny!

3422
02:34:24,020 --> 02:34:25,640
The text is for ants!

3423
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:27,580
I can't read it!

3424
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:28,120
I...

3425
02:34:30,860 --> 02:34:32,300
can't read it at all!

3426
02:34:34,180 --> 02:34:35,500
You're famous though?

3427
02:34:38,880 --> 02:34:40,900
You think too little of yourself.

3428
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:44,280
You're bigger than Elvis!

3429
02:34:46,220 --> 02:34:48,900
You ain't nothing but a hound dog.

3430
02:34:50,220 --> 02:34:51,660
Crying all the time.

3431
02:34:58,660 --> 02:34:59,340
Hmm...

3432
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:02,200
Was that a Zoolander reference?

3433
02:35:04,180 --> 02:35:04,800
Maybe...

3434
02:35:07,630 --> 02:35:09,730
So famous she gets banned in chats.

3435
02:35:12,150 --> 02:35:12,770
Look...

3436
02:35:13,460 --> 02:35:15,890
I don't know... I don't know what you mean.

3437
02:35:17,970 --> 02:35:19,230
I've never been banned.

3438
02:35:22,210 --> 02:35:22,830
And...

3439
02:35:23,460 --> 02:35:24,670
I've always been honest.

3440
02:35:25,350 --> 02:35:26,790
I've always been like...

3441
02:35:26,790 --> 02:35:29,310
If I go into a chat...

3442
02:35:30,010 --> 02:35:31,110
You know...

3443
02:35:31,110 --> 02:35:31,670
I...

3444
02:35:32,930 --> 02:35:37,330
lol I don't know what you mean.

3445
02:35:37,550 --> 02:35:41,330
lol I don't know what you mean.

3446
02:35:43,610 --> 02:35:49,910
lol lol lol I'm going to do something real quick.

3447
02:35:50,910 --> 02:35:51,250
lol

3448
02:35:57,160 --> 02:35:58,360
Was I broken?

3449
02:35:58,900 --> 02:35:59,820
I can't tell.

3450
02:36:00,460 --> 02:36:01,800
Was I broken?

3451
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:02,720
Thank you, thank you!

3452
02:36:05,320 --> 02:36:06,880
I can't tell anymore.

3453
02:36:08,360 --> 02:36:09,160
Umm... Bustin?

3454
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:12,020
Thank you, thank you!

3455
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:19,620
Since I saw someone donate about Ace Combat a couple days ago, begging you to play Ace Combat...

3456
02:36:20,940 --> 02:36:27,240
I just want to say, as much as I love Ace Combat, me and most Ace Combat fans don't want to demand you to play them if you don't want to.

3457
02:36:27,640 --> 02:36:28,040
No!

3458
02:36:28,040 --> 02:36:28,220
No!

3459
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:31,240
Don't worry, don't worry.

3460
02:36:33,360 --> 02:36:34,780
Yes, it is broken.

3461
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:35,360
It's breaking.

3462
02:36:37,960 --> 02:36:40,820
It's not loading for me right now.

3463
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:41,720
Hold on.

3464
02:36:41,860 --> 02:36:44,180
I'm gonna try...

3465
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:49,700
Yeah, I think it's broken.

3466
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:54,760
I think it's broken.

3467
02:36:56,120 --> 02:36:56,800
Thanks!

3468
02:37:00,660 --> 02:37:02,720
Oh gosh, now my chat is actually...

3469
02:37:08,540 --> 02:37:10,120
50 people are watching?

3470
02:37:13,400 --> 02:37:15,300
This is just like old times!

3471
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:17,100
This is just like before I left!

3472
02:37:19,940 --> 02:37:22,200
This is... This is nothing new!

3473
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:24,080
This is literally...

3474
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:25,480
How...

3475
02:37:25,880 --> 02:37:28,460
How it is for... Oh my god, my chat is not even loading anymore.

3476
02:37:30,880 --> 02:37:34,280
Oh my gosh!

3477
02:37:34,420 --> 02:37:35,720
We are back to normal, you guys!

3478
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:40,260
This is just like how it was before I left!

3479
02:37:41,380 --> 02:37:43,440
This is just like how it was before I left!

3480
02:37:44,820 --> 02:37:45,340
Yippee!

3481
02:37:47,860 --> 02:37:54,360
Neil Fears How Much People Love You Neil Fears How Much People Love You No, I actually... I just went... and saw if um...

3482
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:54,980
No, I actually... I just went... and saw if um...

3483
02:37:54,980 --> 02:37:55,940
I don't know.

3484
02:37:55,980 --> 02:37:57,720
Things are not loading... properly.

3485
02:37:58,260 --> 02:37:58,840
I don't know.

3486
02:37:58,840 --> 02:37:59,700
Things are not loading... properly.

3487
02:37:59,700 --> 02:38:02,660
And I'm seeing it's happening on other channels too, so...

3488
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:05,240
You know what, it's... it's fine.

3489
02:38:06,180 --> 02:38:09,200
Small indie company for small indie...

3490
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:10,400
VTuber.

3491
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:11,960
Andrew goes, thanks for the 10 gifted!

3492
02:38:12,380 --> 02:38:14,500
Oh, why is nothing...

3493
02:38:14,500 --> 02:38:16,520
Oh gosh, it's so frustrating.

3494
02:38:16,660 --> 02:38:17,480
Can't see anything.

3495
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:19,980
Time warp back to 2020.

3496
02:38:21,980 --> 02:38:23,000
Oh, YouTube.

3497
02:38:23,980 --> 02:38:24,540
Please.

3498
02:38:24,540 --> 02:38:24,900
Please.

3499
02:38:27,820 --> 02:38:29,500
Hold on, I can't reach anymore.

3500
02:38:38,380 --> 02:38:38,880
Sorry.

3501
02:38:41,400 --> 02:38:45,080
I just opened up the backend of YouTube and I got a comment that was like...

3502
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:47,500
WTF, why do you sing so well?

3503
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:49,080
I don't know.

3504
02:38:50,280 --> 02:38:50,780
Why?

3505
02:38:53,500 --> 02:38:54,000
WTF?

3506
02:38:58,560 --> 02:38:59,320
Oh, guys.

3507
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:02,400
Oh, chat is just like old times.

3508
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:04,200
WTF?

3509
02:39:04,660 --> 02:39:05,580
Why, YouTuber?

3510
02:39:05,780 --> 02:39:06,100
Why?

3511
02:39:06,400 --> 02:39:08,560
Why do you sing so well, YouTuber?

3512
02:39:08,920 --> 02:39:09,480
Huh?

3513
02:39:09,940 --> 02:39:12,380
Why do you have a voice...

3514
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:15,060
on YouTube, YouTuber?

3515
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:17,520
I can't sing...

3516
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:17,880
Oh my gosh.

3517
02:39:18,020 --> 02:39:19,460
That reminds me of...

3518
02:39:19,460 --> 02:39:19,900
Oh my gosh!

3519
02:39:20,360 --> 02:39:21,320
Okay, so...

3520
02:39:23,480 --> 02:39:24,820
Sorry, I was gonna say...

3521
02:39:24,820 --> 02:39:25,920
I was gonna say like...

3522
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:27,040
Why can't I sing?

3523
02:39:27,040 --> 02:39:28,260
Why can't I sing as well as you, YouTuber?

3524
02:39:28,520 --> 02:39:29,880
And that reminded me...

3525
02:39:29,880 --> 02:39:30,460
It was...

3526
02:39:30,890 --> 02:39:31,700
Last night?

3527
02:39:33,620 --> 02:39:35,080
No, it was this morning.

3528
02:39:35,300 --> 02:39:36,700
This morning, I was...

3529
02:39:36,700 --> 02:39:39,880
Okay, so there was this issue on TikTok where...

3530
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:45,400
I don't actually know if it's just a TikTok issue or if it's like a general like...

3531
02:39:46,540 --> 02:39:49,080
Young people on the internet issue now.

3532
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:51,140
But...

3533
02:39:51,810 --> 02:39:53,160
It started on TikTok.

3534
02:39:53,940 --> 02:39:55,720
Or rather, it blew up on TikTok.

3535
02:39:55,720 --> 02:39:56,660
Where...

3536
02:39:56,660 --> 02:39:58,820
Someone made a bean soup.

3537
02:39:59,080 --> 02:39:59,460
Right?

3538
02:39:59,620 --> 02:40:00,380
They were like...

3539
02:40:00,380 --> 02:40:02,800
Okay, here is a recipe for bean soup.

3540
02:40:02,940 --> 02:40:04,760
If you want to have this bean soup.

3541
02:40:05,780 --> 02:40:07,780
And they were getting comments like...

3542
02:40:07,780 --> 02:40:09,320
Well, what if I don't like beans?

3543
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:12,680
Okay.

3544
02:40:13,380 --> 02:40:14,560
Don't make the bean soup.

3545
02:40:16,740 --> 02:40:17,640
And they were like...

3546
02:40:17,640 --> 02:40:17,980
What if...

3547
02:40:17,980 --> 02:40:19,620
What if I can't have that ingredient?

3548
02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:21,520
Okay.

3549
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:23,100
Just don't...

3550
02:40:23,720 --> 02:40:24,300
Add it then.

3551
02:40:24,300 --> 02:40:25,260
You know?

3552
02:40:25,880 --> 02:40:26,800
Like just...

3553
02:40:27,780 --> 02:40:29,240
Like there was this weird...

3554
02:40:29,240 --> 02:40:31,460
Thing where like people are like...

3555
02:40:31,460 --> 02:40:32,940
Starting to...

3556
02:40:32,940 --> 02:40:34,080
Watch videos.

3557
02:40:34,720 --> 02:40:35,440
And that's...

3558
02:40:35,440 --> 02:40:36,520
This is why I think it's like...

3559
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:37,380
Younger...

3560
02:40:37,380 --> 02:40:38,980
Like younger audiences.

3561
02:40:39,020 --> 02:40:40,180
Because they'll be like...

3562
02:40:40,180 --> 02:40:41,200
They'll take...

3563
02:40:41,200 --> 02:40:43,920
They'll watch a video and take it very personally like...

3564
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:45,280
Well, what if I can't do this thing?

3565
02:40:45,660 --> 02:40:46,140
Okay.

3566
02:40:46,540 --> 02:40:47,560
Then you can't...

3567
02:40:47,560 --> 02:40:48,320
Do it.

3568
02:40:48,320 --> 02:40:48,720
That's okay.

3569
02:40:49,080 --> 02:40:49,880
And so...

3570
02:40:49,880 --> 02:40:52,540
I experienced it first hand this morning.

3571
02:40:52,760 --> 02:40:54,280
When I was watching a TikTok video.

3572
02:40:54,280 --> 02:40:56,020
And it was about this like...

3573
02:40:56,020 --> 02:40:57,860
Crazy grocery store that's in Ohio.

3574
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:00,300
And they were like...

3575
02:41:00,300 --> 02:41:01,240
You should go...

3576
02:41:01,240 --> 02:41:01,680
It was like...

3577
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:02,160
It's like a...

3578
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:03,600
It's like a real grocery store.

3579
02:41:04,580 --> 02:41:06,060
That like has...

3580
02:41:06,060 --> 02:41:08,000
Like animatronics in it.

3581
02:41:08,280 --> 02:41:08,840
And...

3582
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:10,080
It's...

3583
02:41:10,080 --> 02:41:11,600
Only in Ohio.

3584
02:41:12,360 --> 02:41:12,920
Yes!

3585
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:13,880
Jungle gyms!

3586
02:41:13,960 --> 02:41:14,700
Jungle gyms!

3587
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:15,320
Yes!

3588
02:41:15,360 --> 02:41:15,600
Yes!

3589
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:15,880
Yes!

3590
02:41:15,880 --> 02:41:16,100
Yes!

3591
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:16,260
Yes!

3592
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:19,740
It's called jungle gyms.

3593
02:41:19,780 --> 02:41:20,380
And it has like...

3594
02:41:20,380 --> 02:41:21,220
Monorails.

3595
02:41:21,240 --> 02:41:21,760
Like...

3596
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:22,640
It is crazy.

3597
02:41:23,700 --> 02:41:24,260
It's like...

3598
02:41:24,260 --> 02:41:25,600
It's super...

3599
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:25,980
Like...

3600
02:41:26,700 --> 02:41:28,500
There's a movie theater in it.

3601
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:30,340
To teach you about jungle gym.

3602
02:41:30,520 --> 02:41:30,940
Like...

3603
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:32,120
But...

3604
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:33,160
Anyway...

3605
02:41:33,160 --> 02:41:33,720
So...

3606
02:41:33,720 --> 02:41:34,860
The video was like...

3607
02:41:34,860 --> 02:41:36,400
If you are in Ohio...

3608
02:41:36,400 --> 02:41:38,560
You gotta go check out jungle gyms.

3609
02:41:38,780 --> 02:41:39,300
Like...

3610
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:41,100
It's a really crazy grocery store.

3611
02:41:41,680 --> 02:41:42,880
Go check it out.

3612
02:41:43,640 --> 02:41:44,160
Awesome.

3613
02:41:44,220 --> 02:41:44,580
Cool.

3614
02:41:44,680 --> 02:41:46,000
Thanks for the recommendation, guy.

3615
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:46,520
Like...

3616
02:41:46,520 --> 02:41:47,920
If I'm ever in Ohio...

3617
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:49,880
I'm gonna go to jungle gyms.

3618
02:41:51,580 --> 02:41:52,100
But...

3619
02:41:52,100 --> 02:41:53,260
There was a comment...

3620
02:41:53,260 --> 02:41:54,040
That was just like...

3621
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:54,240
Hey...

3622
02:41:54,240 --> 02:41:55,420
You should check out Omega Mart.

3623
02:41:55,580 --> 02:41:55,860
Which...

3624
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:57,180
If you don't know what Omega Mart is...

3625
02:41:57,180 --> 02:41:58,240
It's like a...

3626
02:41:59,120 --> 02:41:59,600
Mmm...

3627
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:00,480
It's...

3628
02:42:00,480 --> 02:42:01,220
It's an...

3629
02:42:01,220 --> 02:42:02,180
It's really an art...

3630
02:42:02,180 --> 02:42:03,400
An art exhibit.

3631
02:42:03,620 --> 02:42:04,340
It's like...

3632
02:42:04,860 --> 02:42:05,820
They have like...

3633
02:42:05,820 --> 02:42:06,560
Rooms...

3634
02:42:07,060 --> 02:42:07,540
Behind...

3635
02:42:07,540 --> 02:42:08,340
Like...

3636
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:09,840
Doors...

3637
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:10,560
Like...

3638
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:11,020
Like...

3639
02:42:11,020 --> 02:42:11,820
You open up the...

3640
02:42:11,820 --> 02:42:13,300
The thing to think you're getting milk.

3641
02:42:13,400 --> 02:42:14,620
But it's actually a secret room.

3642
02:42:15,340 --> 02:42:15,820
Um...

3643
02:42:15,820 --> 02:42:16,160
Yeah...

3644
02:42:16,160 --> 02:42:17,040
It's like an art installation.

3645
02:42:17,460 --> 02:42:17,700
Yeah...

3646
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:18,120
That's a better...

3647
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:18,600
Art installation.

3648
02:42:18,680 --> 02:42:19,320
Not exhibit.

3649
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:20,400
Um...

3650
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:21,940
A playground for adults.

3651
02:42:21,940 --> 02:42:22,500
Yeah...

3652
02:42:22,500 --> 02:42:22,820
Like...

3653
02:42:22,820 --> 02:42:24,260
It's not a real grocery store.

3654
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:24,540
Right?

3655
02:42:24,680 --> 02:42:26,120
It's just like an art exhibit.

3656
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:28,000
And...

3657
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:29,140
So someone was just like...

3658
02:42:29,140 --> 02:42:29,900
You should check out...

3659
02:42:29,900 --> 02:42:30,840
Omega Mart.

3660
02:42:32,200 --> 02:42:32,760
Um...

3661
02:42:32,760 --> 02:42:37,100
And the creator who posted the original video about jungle gyms was like...

3662
02:42:37,100 --> 02:42:37,300
Oh...

3663
02:42:37,300 --> 02:42:37,660
Well...

3664
02:42:37,660 --> 02:42:40,180
Omega Mart is different because it's an art installation.

3665
02:42:40,260 --> 02:42:41,960
This is an actual grocery store.

3666
02:42:42,140 --> 02:42:42,560
So...

3667
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:43,040
It's...

3668
02:42:43,040 --> 02:42:43,660
Kind of different.

3669
02:42:44,800 --> 02:42:46,840
And then there's one other person.

3670
02:42:47,500 --> 02:42:48,060
Comments...

3671
02:42:48,700 --> 02:42:49,260
Below...

3672
02:42:49,260 --> 02:42:50,620
And says...

3673
02:42:50,620 --> 02:42:51,240
Yeah...

3674
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:51,700
Well...

3675
02:42:51,940 --> 02:42:52,980
You know...

3676
02:42:53,620 --> 02:42:54,180
Um...

3677
02:42:54,180 --> 02:42:55,860
I can't go to Ohio.

3678
02:42:56,120 --> 02:42:57,440
It's too far away from me.

3679
02:42:57,900 --> 02:42:59,800
Actually, Vegas is closer to me.

3680
02:42:59,860 --> 02:43:01,260
So I'm gonna go to Omega Mart.

3681
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:05,680
That's like...

3682
02:43:05,680 --> 02:43:06,780
Okay...

3683
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:08,740
I mean...

3684
02:43:08,740 --> 02:43:09,380
Then...

3685
02:43:09,380 --> 02:43:10,360
Don't go.

3686
02:43:15,410 --> 02:43:16,430
That's like...

3687
02:43:16,430 --> 02:43:17,650
And people were like...

3688
02:43:17,650 --> 02:43:18,910
People were like...

3689
02:43:18,910 --> 02:43:19,590
I mean...

3690
02:43:19,590 --> 02:43:20,990
It depends on where you live.

3691
02:43:21,290 --> 02:43:22,630
For some people...

3692
02:43:22,630 --> 02:43:23,910
Ohio is pretty close.

3693
02:43:23,990 --> 02:43:24,470
You know?

3694
02:43:25,290 --> 02:43:26,070
You can just...

3695
02:43:26,070 --> 02:43:27,430
Some people can just go.

3696
02:43:27,670 --> 02:43:28,110
And they were like...

3697
02:43:28,110 --> 02:43:28,310
Yeah...

3698
02:43:28,310 --> 02:43:29,130
But I can't.

3699
02:43:30,310 --> 02:43:31,770
Vegas is closer to me.

3700
02:43:31,830 --> 02:43:33,090
So I'm going to Omega Mart.

3701
02:43:33,390 --> 02:43:34,610
I'm like...

3702
02:43:37,370 --> 02:43:37,930
Okay...

3703
02:43:37,930 --> 02:43:38,510
Have fun.

3704
02:43:38,870 --> 02:43:39,270
But...

3705
02:43:39,270 --> 02:43:39,870
Like...

3706
02:43:39,870 --> 02:43:41,930
I don't know why...

3707
02:43:41,930 --> 02:43:44,450
Why kids take these videos so...

3708
02:43:44,450 --> 02:43:44,970
Like...

3709
02:43:44,970 --> 02:43:45,230
So...

3710
02:43:45,230 --> 02:43:46,330
Personally now.

3711
02:43:46,450 --> 02:43:46,770
Like...

3712
02:43:46,770 --> 02:43:47,950
Kids are like...

3713
02:43:47,950 --> 02:43:50,030
They'll watch something and be like...

3714
02:43:50,030 --> 02:43:51,790
If this doesn't relate a hundred...

3715
02:43:51,790 --> 02:43:51,990
Like...

3716
02:43:51,990 --> 02:43:53,530
They take For You page...

3717
02:43:53,530 --> 02:43:54,910
Extremely seriously.

3718
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:55,810
They're just like...

3719
02:43:55,810 --> 02:43:56,050
I don't know.

3720
02:43:56,050 --> 02:43:57,530
This page is supposed to be for me.

3721
02:43:57,670 --> 02:43:58,810
So everything...

3722
02:43:59,610 --> 02:44:02,330
Everything should be catered to me.

3723
02:44:02,570 --> 02:44:03,350
You know what I mean?

3724
02:44:03,410 --> 02:44:04,390
I think that's what it is.

3725
02:44:04,490 --> 02:44:04,950
I don't know.

3726
02:44:05,470 --> 02:44:06,690
It's so strange.

3727
02:44:07,170 --> 02:44:09,630
This is what happens when you're raised by an iPad.

3728
02:44:10,070 --> 02:44:10,570
I don't...

3729
02:44:10,570 --> 02:44:11,730
It's so...

3730
02:44:12,510 --> 02:44:14,470
Maybe it is just an entitlement thing.

3731
02:44:14,530 --> 02:44:14,870
Right?

3732
02:44:15,450 --> 02:44:15,950
I...

3733
02:44:15,950 --> 02:44:16,270
It's...

3734
02:44:16,870 --> 02:44:18,150
If it isn't for me...

3735
02:44:18,150 --> 02:44:19,210
It's against me.

3736
02:44:19,790 --> 02:44:21,330
I was like...

3737
02:44:23,790 --> 02:44:24,290
Oh...

3738
02:44:24,290 --> 02:44:26,030
The algorithm has failed.

3739
02:44:26,050 --> 02:44:26,590
It has failed me.

3740
02:44:26,670 --> 02:44:27,790
And it's your fault.

3741
02:44:28,130 --> 02:44:28,570
Like...

3742
02:44:28,570 --> 02:44:28,990
I don't know.

3743
02:44:29,090 --> 02:44:29,910
I just never...

3744
02:44:30,450 --> 02:44:30,890
Would...

3745
02:44:30,890 --> 02:44:31,890
I just...

3746
02:44:31,890 --> 02:44:33,390
I don't know if this is a new thing.

3747
02:44:34,490 --> 02:44:35,190
Or what.

3748
02:44:35,270 --> 02:44:35,690
Because...

3749
02:44:35,690 --> 02:44:36,210
You know...

3750
02:44:36,210 --> 02:44:37,190
When I was a kid...

3751
02:44:38,330 --> 02:44:39,410
When I was a kid...

3752
02:44:39,410 --> 02:44:39,610
Like...

3753
02:44:39,610 --> 02:44:41,090
I would never watch a video...

3754
02:44:41,090 --> 02:44:42,230
And be like...

3755
02:44:43,290 --> 02:44:43,730
Oh...

3756
02:44:43,730 --> 02:44:44,110
But...

3757
02:44:44,110 --> 02:44:46,530
They didn't think about my needs.

3758
02:44:50,010 --> 02:44:51,750
It's a new generation thing.

3759
02:44:52,170 --> 02:44:53,050
So crazy.

3760
02:44:53,270 --> 02:44:54,330
It's very interesting.

3761
02:44:54,770 --> 02:44:55,330
I mean...

3762
02:44:55,330 --> 02:44:56,090
It's not good.

3763
02:44:56,210 --> 02:44:56,430
Maybe.

3764
02:44:56,490 --> 02:44:56,830
But...

3765
02:44:57,930 --> 02:44:58,770
I just...

3766
02:44:58,770 --> 02:45:01,610
I was so shocked that I experienced it first hand.

3767
02:45:01,850 --> 02:45:02,390
You know?

3768
02:45:06,450 --> 02:45:06,930
Hmm...

3769
02:45:06,930 --> 02:45:08,790
People being isolated at home.

3770
02:45:08,850 --> 02:45:10,470
Not socializing in person for a while.

3771
02:45:10,550 --> 02:45:12,130
Probably did a whole lot of something.

3772
02:45:12,330 --> 02:45:13,350
That's so true.

3773
02:45:13,990 --> 02:45:14,470
Oh...

3774
02:45:14,470 --> 02:45:16,550
We need to get these kids on Homestar Runner.

3775
02:45:21,130 --> 02:45:22,890
Get off the skibbity toilet.

3776
02:45:23,570 --> 02:45:25,190
Get them on Homestar Runner.

3777
02:45:25,490 --> 02:45:26,650
Have them reading...

3778
02:45:26,650 --> 02:45:28,370
Have them sending in strong bad e-mails.

3779
02:45:35,190 --> 02:45:35,750
Yeah...

3780
02:45:37,230 --> 02:45:37,790
Marzipan.

3781
02:45:42,290 --> 02:45:43,410
But yeah...

3782
02:45:43,410 --> 02:45:44,510
This was fun.

3783
02:45:44,890 --> 02:45:46,490
Hope you guys enjoyed...

3784
02:45:46,490 --> 02:45:48,050
Being a little pez...

3785
02:45:48,050 --> 02:45:48,350
Well...

3786
02:45:48,350 --> 02:45:49,550
We weren't a peasant.

3787
02:45:49,830 --> 02:45:51,110
Then we became a peasant.

3788
02:45:52,290 --> 02:45:52,850
And...

3789
02:45:53,450 --> 02:45:54,010
Okay.

3790
02:45:54,210 --> 02:45:54,930
I want your opinion.

3791
02:45:55,730 --> 02:45:56,630
Would it make you feel better?

3792
02:45:56,630 --> 02:45:59,170
Would your maid be above a peasant or below a peasant?

3793
02:46:00,950 --> 02:46:01,430
Like...

3794
02:46:01,430 --> 02:46:01,850
What if I...

3795
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:02,790
You know...

3796
02:46:02,790 --> 02:46:04,230
What if I'm like a royal maid?

3797
02:46:04,430 --> 02:46:04,670
You know?

3798
02:46:04,730 --> 02:46:04,990
Like...

3799
02:46:04,990 --> 02:46:06,450
What if I'm working at like a...

3800
02:46:07,130 --> 02:46:07,610
Above?

3801
02:46:07,790 --> 02:46:08,070
Above?

3802
02:46:08,370 --> 02:46:08,550
Above?

3803
02:46:08,670 --> 02:46:08,910
Above?

3804
02:46:08,910 --> 02:46:09,150
Above?

3805
02:46:09,250 --> 02:46:09,430
Above?

3806
02:46:11,950 --> 02:46:12,910
Same level?

3807
02:46:13,310 --> 02:46:13,790
Equal?

3808
02:46:13,790 --> 02:46:14,150
Above?

3809
02:46:16,490 --> 02:46:17,450
Same league?

3810
02:46:18,190 --> 02:46:20,270
Depends on who you made for, I think.

3811
02:46:21,850 --> 02:46:22,330
Above?

3812
02:46:23,990 --> 02:46:24,470
Above?

3813
02:46:24,590 --> 02:46:24,710
Above?

3814
02:46:25,050 --> 02:46:25,350
Above?

3815
02:46:32,320 --> 02:46:32,960
Okay.

3816
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:38,420
I...

3817
02:46:38,420 --> 02:46:40,840
I was above the peasant.

3818
02:46:45,910 --> 02:46:46,550
You...

3819
02:46:46,550 --> 02:46:47,470
Are pe...

3820
02:46:47,470 --> 02:46:47,750
Wait.

3821
02:46:47,830 --> 02:46:49,890
If you're a peasant, then I can't be your maid.

3822
02:46:50,830 --> 02:46:51,470
Hmm...

3823
02:46:54,180 --> 02:46:54,820
Okay.

3824
02:46:54,860 --> 02:46:55,580
You're not peasant.

3825
02:46:56,940 --> 02:46:58,420
You're all royalty.

3826
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:02,900
You're all royalty.

3827
02:47:05,180 --> 02:47:06,800
I'm a rich peasant.

3828
02:47:08,820 --> 02:47:09,240
You're...

3829
02:47:10,610 --> 02:47:12,650
Thank you, Churro.

3830
02:47:12,890 --> 02:47:13,490
Ooh...

3831
02:47:14,750 --> 02:47:15,630
No dice.

3832
02:47:15,950 --> 02:47:16,550
Nanoplasm.

3833
02:47:16,550 --> 02:47:17,130
Sorry.

3834
02:47:21,890 --> 02:47:23,150
Take this, king.

3835
02:47:26,990 --> 02:47:28,110
What happened to...

3836
02:47:28,110 --> 02:47:31,430
I said it at the beginning.

3837
02:47:31,830 --> 02:47:32,470
I said...

3838
02:47:32,470 --> 02:47:36,530
I always say it.

3839
02:47:36,670 --> 02:47:37,570
What do you mean?

3840
02:47:38,850 --> 02:47:40,170
I said it...

3841
02:47:47,780 --> 02:47:48,280
Yeah!

3842
02:47:49,180 --> 02:47:49,680
Yeah!

3843
02:47:52,060 --> 02:47:55,160
Mint my kami peasant oshi.

3844
02:47:57,980 --> 02:47:58,480
Thanks.

3845
02:47:59,280 --> 02:48:02,380
Oh no, I meant, how can we be ojousama and also peasant?

3846
02:48:02,600 --> 02:48:03,080
Oh!

3847
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:06,440
That's why I said you're not a peasant.

3848
02:48:06,620 --> 02:48:08,580
You are above even the peasant.

3849
02:48:08,660 --> 02:48:10,340
You are big peasant!

3850
02:48:15,660 --> 02:48:16,640
I'm just a merchant.

3851
02:48:16,860 --> 02:48:17,560
Sell, sell, sell.

3852
02:48:18,340 --> 02:48:19,340
What are you buying?

3853
02:48:20,640 --> 02:48:21,840
What are you selling?

3854
02:48:22,940 --> 02:48:24,320
Yeah, what are you selling?

3855
02:48:24,680 --> 02:48:25,960
What are you selling, merchant?

3856
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:27,580
What are your wares?

3857
02:48:28,840 --> 02:48:29,420
What's that?

3858
02:48:37,400 --> 02:48:38,780
Royals have noble maids.

3859
02:48:38,880 --> 02:48:40,960
Nobles have peasant maids.

3860
02:48:42,940 --> 02:48:44,840
Thanks for the five gifted!

3861
02:48:45,140 --> 02:48:45,940
Thank you!

3862
02:48:47,360 --> 02:48:48,700
RE4 stream win.

3863
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:54,220
You guys, besides Resident Evil 1, I've never played a Resident Evil game before.

3864
02:48:55,720 --> 02:48:58,100
I've always wanted to play, but I'm kind of scared.

3865
02:48:58,760 --> 02:49:01,940
Aren't maid cafes made for us peasants to experience maids?

3866
02:49:02,860 --> 02:49:03,440
No.

3867
02:49:04,540 --> 02:49:05,120
Well...

3868
02:49:06,740 --> 02:49:09,440
But when you go in, you are not the peasant.

3869
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:10,140
You transform.

3870
02:49:12,360 --> 02:49:13,480
Magical moe magic.

3871
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:22,000
Resident 4 is... Resident 4?

3872
02:49:22,120 --> 02:49:23,100
Resident 4!

3873
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:26,160
Raymac, thanks for the five gifted!

3874
02:49:27,180 --> 02:49:30,340
Merry Music Moth, welcome to Membooship!

3875
02:49:30,860 --> 02:49:32,380
Hakurei Mima!

3876
02:49:35,240 --> 02:49:37,100
Mima posting in 2024!

3877
02:49:37,940 --> 02:49:39,020
Welcome to Membooship!

3878
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:41,780
Ducky, thanks for the five gifted!

3879
02:49:42,160 --> 02:49:43,820
Alvin, thank you for the five gifted!

3880
02:49:44,020 --> 02:49:45,560
Thank you guys, thank you!

3881
02:49:46,100 --> 02:49:47,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3882
02:49:49,460 --> 02:49:50,480
The four residents.

3883
02:49:53,680 --> 02:49:55,500
Not the 50 drop!

3884
02:49:56,360 --> 02:49:57,340
Thank you!

3885
02:49:57,640 --> 02:49:58,860
Thank you so much!

3886
02:49:59,620 --> 02:50:00,620
Thank you, Mima!

3887
02:50:01,780 --> 02:50:03,440
Natsuki, thank you for the five gifted!

3888
02:50:04,300 --> 02:50:05,700
LPR, thank you for the five gifted!

3889
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:06,780
Why is everybody suddenly gifting?

3890
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:11,720
RE4 is more action than scary.

3891
02:50:12,200 --> 02:50:13,340
You're way scarier.

3892
02:50:13,540 --> 02:50:14,280
See, that's why...

3893
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:16,860
That's actually partially why I've never played Resident Evil.

3894
02:50:16,960 --> 02:50:17,440
Because...

3895
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:20,500
I always thought the games were more action than scary.

3896
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:21,120
But...

3897
02:50:21,120 --> 02:50:22,100
Just...

3898
02:50:24,340 --> 02:50:24,900
Stop!

3899
02:50:30,920 --> 02:50:31,480
No!

3900
02:50:35,160 --> 02:50:37,480
Because they were more action than scary.

3901
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:38,820
And I always was like...

3902
02:50:38,820 --> 02:50:40,320
Well, I like scary games more.

3903
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:41,340
But then...

3904
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:42,640
Then VII came out.

3905
02:50:42,720 --> 02:50:43,460
And I was like...

3906
02:50:44,460 --> 02:50:45,940
They're so scary now!

3907
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:47,940
But they're also like...

3908
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:48,580
So goofy.

3909
02:50:49,080 --> 02:50:51,180
I want to see Leon and Cat...

3910
02:50:52,040 --> 02:50:53,820
Does he actually wear cat ears?

3911
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:54,820
Or is that just a meme?

3912
02:50:55,300 --> 02:50:56,720
Oh my gosh, you guys!

3913
02:50:57,380 --> 02:50:57,740
Stop!

3914
02:51:00,800 --> 02:51:02,040
Jay, thank you for the five!

3915
02:51:02,620 --> 02:51:04,100
Mima, thank you for the Akazufa!

3916
02:51:05,580 --> 02:51:07,140
Dungokai, welcome to Mimu's ship!

3917
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:09,000

3921
02:51:15,420 --> 02:51:16,560
Paperbacks, thank you for the five gifted!

3922
02:51:16,900 --> 02:51:18,280
Takeoff and Yanyan, thank you for the five gifted!

3923
02:51:20,900 --> 02:51:22,500
Bloodlines, thank you for the ten gifted!

3924
02:51:23,160 --> 02:51:25,080
No theater, thank you for the five gifted!

3925
02:51:25,400 --> 02:51:26,400
Stupid shark!

3926
02:51:28,160 --> 02:51:29,620
Thank you for the twenty gifted!

3927
02:51:29,740 --> 02:51:30,600
Hey, that's not a shark!

3928
02:51:31,120 --> 02:51:32,300
That looks like a bird!

3929
02:51:32,720 --> 02:51:33,880
Your profile picture...

3930
02:51:33,880 --> 02:51:34,880
Thank you for the five gifted!

3931
02:51:35,220 --> 02:51:35,780
Thank you!

3932
02:51:37,860 --> 02:51:39,180
Thank you for the five gifted!

3933
02:51:39,300 --> 02:51:39,660
Arigato!

3934
02:51:44,320 --> 02:51:44,700
Okay.

3935
02:51:45,180 --> 02:51:46,160
What were we talking about?

3936
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:49,360
Leon Kennedy's...

3937
02:51:51,500 --> 02:51:52,320
Cat ears.

3938
02:51:56,420 --> 02:51:56,940
S810!

3939
02:51:58,660 --> 02:52:00,160
Ritual, thank you for the five gifted!

3940
02:52:00,380 --> 02:52:00,820
Thank you!

3941
02:52:01,660 --> 02:52:02,860
Thank you so much!

3942
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:09,940
Cat ear Leon.

3943
02:52:11,180 --> 02:52:12,120
Is it real?

3944
02:52:12,380 --> 02:52:14,660
Does he actually wear cat ears or...

3945
02:52:14,660 --> 02:52:18,300
To answer your question, the cat ears are after you beat the game.

3946
02:52:18,820 --> 02:52:19,340
No!

3947
02:52:24,210 --> 02:52:24,870
It's hard.

3948
02:52:27,090 --> 02:52:29,250
I was going to say it's hard living, but I don't.

3949
02:52:30,590 --> 02:52:31,790
It's hard after living.

3950
02:52:32,650 --> 02:52:35,550
We're giving you money so that you can go above a regular peasant.

3951
02:52:35,750 --> 02:52:36,130
Stop!

3952
02:52:37,490 --> 02:52:40,070
The word game that you're looking for is System Shock 2.

3953
02:52:41,850 --> 02:52:42,530
What is that?

3954
02:52:42,610 --> 02:52:43,690
System Shock 2.

3955
02:52:51,640 --> 02:52:53,220
Did you guys hear me gulping?

3956
02:52:54,820 --> 02:52:55,360
Say no.

3957
02:53:05,620 --> 02:53:06,420
Actually,

3958
02:53:10,700 --> 02:53:11,020
I can't.

3959
02:53:15,980 --> 02:53:17,180
I can't tell.

3960
02:53:17,660 --> 02:53:20,940
Found the tofu very soon funny myself.

3961
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:22,400
Tofu?

3962
02:53:26,780 --> 02:53:28,960
System Shock 2 is a classic.

3963
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:32,720
System...

3964
02:53:37,140 --> 02:53:41,220
I was thinking recently That I was like, oh my gosh.

3965
02:53:41,380 --> 02:53:44,180
I've been wanting to play Blade Runner for so long.

3966
02:53:45,780 --> 02:53:47,740
I was thinking of playing it on Sunday.

3967
02:53:48,980 --> 02:53:50,300
I'm not sure yet though.

3968
02:53:52,060 --> 02:53:53,700
Tofu is a RE2 thing.

3969
02:53:54,560 --> 02:53:55,640
And I didn't...

3970
02:53:55,640 --> 02:54:01,220
When I played Resident Evil 1, I didn't even beat it.

3971
02:54:01,280 --> 02:54:02,620
I only played a little bit of it.

3972
02:54:03,160 --> 02:54:03,640
So...

3973
02:54:05,900 --> 02:54:06,760
Blade Runner.

3974
02:54:06,760 --> 02:54:08,320
Yeah, I really wanted to play...

3975
02:54:08,700 --> 02:54:09,860
They have like the...

3976
02:54:09,860 --> 02:54:12,160
Actually, I know they have it on GOG.

3977
02:54:12,220 --> 02:54:13,380
I think it's also on...

3978
02:54:15,500 --> 02:54:16,220
Blade Runner.

3979
02:54:16,500 --> 02:54:17,360
Is it on Steam?

3980
02:54:18,460 --> 02:54:19,960
Yeah, they also have it on Steam.

3981
02:54:20,480 --> 02:54:21,980
Actually, I can't remember...

3982
02:54:21,980 --> 02:54:24,440
The reviews are kind of mixed on it though.

3983
02:54:25,180 --> 02:54:25,660
Uh oh.

3984
02:54:29,420 --> 02:54:30,140
Thank you!

3985
02:54:31,200 --> 02:54:32,880
Thanks for reminding me of Trogdor.

3986
02:54:32,980 --> 02:54:33,640
Love your streams.

3987
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:35,080
Thank you!

3988
02:54:36,440 --> 02:54:38,160
Maybe I should do the GOG one.

3989
02:54:38,320 --> 02:54:40,200
Get the GOG one for the functional one.

3990
02:54:40,300 --> 02:54:40,740
Okay, okay.

3991
02:54:44,260 --> 02:54:46,100
Yeah, maybe we'll play that on Sunday.

3992
02:54:46,160 --> 02:54:47,120
I haven't decided yet.

3993
02:54:47,900 --> 02:54:49,440
But I've been wanting to play it.

3994
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:50,020
So...

3995
02:54:51,260 --> 02:54:52,040
Blade Runner.

3996
02:55:00,200 --> 02:55:01,940
The re-release is buggy.

3997
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:05,240
The Steam one maybe.

3998
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:07,900
It has some positive reviews recently.

3999
02:55:08,200 --> 02:55:08,860
I don't know if they...

4000
02:55:08,860 --> 02:55:09,860
Oh, it says fixed now!

4001
02:55:10,580 --> 02:55:10,920
Wait.

4002
02:55:11,140 --> 02:55:13,020
Posted December 30th, 2023.

4003
02:55:13,580 --> 02:55:17,680
Seems like Night Dive has largely fixed the issues the remaster had at launch.

4004
02:55:18,240 --> 02:55:20,860
Do yourself a favor and just play the enhanced edition.

4005
02:55:21,720 --> 02:55:22,280
Do yourself a favor and just play the enhanced edition.

4006
02:55:23,720 --> 02:55:24,540
Oh, nice!

4007
02:55:24,720 --> 02:55:25,640
There we go then.

4008
02:55:26,740 --> 02:55:28,380
You heard it here, folks.

4009
02:55:28,560 --> 02:55:31,640
According to Agent Smith on Steam.

4010
02:55:32,880 --> 02:55:33,320
According to Agent Smith on Steam.

4011
02:55:33,640 --> 02:55:36,980
They said that it is fixed as of December 30th, 2023.

4012
02:55:37,080 --> 02:55:38,140
That is really recent.

4013
02:55:40,960 --> 02:55:42,340
That's really recent.

4014
02:55:43,640 --> 02:55:45,620
If anything, it's only $10.

4015
02:55:45,700 --> 02:55:47,040
So, you know.

4016
02:55:47,280 --> 02:55:48,800
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna...

4017
02:55:49,340 --> 02:55:50,380
I'm gonna go...

4018
02:55:50,380 --> 02:55:53,720
Oh my gosh, I'm like looking at it right now and it's so nostalgic.

4019
02:55:54,100 --> 02:55:55,600
Are there boobies in this game?

4020
02:55:55,680 --> 02:55:56,880
Or am I safe?

4021
02:55:59,600 --> 02:56:00,640
I don't know.

4022
02:56:03,640 --> 02:56:04,700
I'm not sure.

4023
02:56:07,320 --> 02:56:08,840
Siege, thanks for the 10 gifted!

4024
02:56:09,820 --> 02:56:10,460
Yes!

4025
02:56:13,100 --> 02:56:13,740
Boobies...

4026
02:56:13,740 --> 02:56:15,500
Oh, yeah!

4027
02:56:18,160 --> 02:56:19,620
It was the 90s.

4028
02:56:19,620 --> 02:56:20,720
So anything is possible.

4029
02:56:21,240 --> 02:56:22,480
I don't know when this...

4030
02:56:23,280 --> 02:56:24,700
When this game came out.

4031
02:56:25,960 --> 02:56:26,600
1998?

4032
02:56:28,840 --> 02:56:29,480
Anyway.

4033
02:56:31,380 --> 02:56:32,440
I don't know yet.

4034
02:56:33,640 --> 02:56:33,980
Maybe another time.

4035
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:39,420
There's soft nudity.

4036
02:56:41,360 --> 02:56:41,880
Don't...

4037
02:56:41,880 --> 02:56:43,160
Don't get mad at me, YouTube.

4038
02:56:44,240 --> 02:56:45,400
Don't get mad at me.

4039
02:56:47,500 --> 02:56:48,380
It's art.

4040
02:56:48,700 --> 02:56:49,540
It's art.

4041
02:56:49,820 --> 02:56:51,560
It's not real.

4042
02:56:51,640 --> 02:56:52,980
It's fake, it's fake, it's fake.

4043
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:53,580
It's art.

4044
02:56:59,720 --> 02:57:00,400
Belly button.

4045
02:57:01,740 --> 02:57:03,980
Do you guys want to see my belly button?

4046
02:57:06,660 --> 02:57:07,740
I can't see it.

4047
02:57:07,780 --> 02:57:08,540
It's covered by an apron.

4048
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:12,560
You'll never know.

4049
02:57:13,680 --> 02:57:14,760
You'll never know.

4050
02:57:15,080 --> 02:57:15,180
You'll never know.

4051
02:57:15,480 --> 02:57:16,000
You'll never know.

4052
02:57:17,800 --> 02:57:18,840
For free?

4053
02:57:24,160 --> 02:57:25,280
Played like a fiddle.

4054
02:57:27,900 --> 02:57:29,900
I mean, you can see...

4055
02:57:30,460 --> 02:57:30,940
Well...

4056
02:57:32,820 --> 02:57:33,660
You can...

4057
02:57:33,660 --> 02:57:35,460
The frills kind of block my...

4058
02:57:36,920 --> 02:57:38,460
My armpits a little bit.

4059
02:57:45,400 --> 02:57:45,880
It's...

4060
02:57:45,880 --> 02:57:48,060
I have to be nice and breezy.

4061
02:57:48,360 --> 02:57:49,980
So that when I'm working, you know.

4062
02:57:54,310 --> 02:57:55,770
It's got to be nice and breezy.

4063
02:58:00,680 --> 02:58:02,020
It's on the summer art.

4064
02:58:02,120 --> 02:58:02,460
So, ha!

4065
02:58:04,040 --> 02:58:04,760
You're right.

4066
02:58:14,590 --> 02:58:15,150
You're right.

4067
02:58:30,660 --> 02:58:31,800
Got to take it down.

4068
02:58:34,760 --> 02:58:37,200
Time to take it down.

4069
02:58:41,040 --> 02:58:41,920
Get wrecked.

4070
02:58:43,300 --> 02:58:44,180
Mass recall.

4071
02:58:44,340 --> 02:58:45,300
Cancel the project!

4072
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:46,480
Cancel it!

4073
02:58:46,480 --> 02:58:47,060
Cancel it!

4074
02:58:47,100 --> 02:58:47,660
Shut it down!

4075
02:58:48,980 --> 02:58:50,800
There's like a big red button in front of me.

4076
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:52,100
And I'm like...

4077
02:58:53,920 --> 02:58:54,360
No!

4078
02:58:57,740 --> 02:59:00,760
I forgot it was on the summertime merch.

4079
02:59:00,940 --> 02:59:01,080
No!

4080
02:59:02,920 --> 02:59:04,140
No, no, no!

4081
02:59:04,880 --> 02:59:05,400
No!

4082
02:59:05,500 --> 02:59:06,580
I thought I was safe.

4083
02:59:07,960 --> 02:59:09,240
Don't look, you guys.

4084
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:09,940
Don't.

4085
02:59:11,820 --> 02:59:12,440
Don't look.

4086
02:59:13,500 --> 02:59:15,620
Don't look at my belly button.

4087
02:59:16,140 --> 02:59:16,660
No!

4088
02:59:17,780 --> 02:59:18,300
No!

4089
02:59:18,600 --> 02:59:20,200
Thank you for the tag!

4090
02:59:20,260 --> 02:59:21,240
Thank you!

4091
02:59:21,940 --> 02:59:23,220
Thank you so much!

4092
02:59:23,220 --> 02:59:23,360
Bye!

4093
02:59:30,220 --> 02:59:31,810
Who's the fiddle now, Mint?

4094
02:59:34,130 --> 02:59:35,630
Why are we here?

4095
02:59:36,730 --> 02:59:37,950
Just to suffer.

4096
02:59:43,980 --> 02:59:45,140
I perceive.

4097
02:59:50,590 --> 02:59:52,010
You better stop it.

4098
02:59:52,490 --> 02:59:54,430
You better stop perceiving.

4099
02:59:55,230 --> 02:59:56,190
Right now.

4100
02:59:58,250 --> 02:59:59,650
If one...

4101
02:59:59,650 --> 03:00:00,770
Wait, if you...

4102
03:00:00,770 --> 03:00:05,170
If you get ghost busted, do pieces of your outfit get ripped off like...

4103
03:00:19,710 --> 03:00:21,130
What is this?

4104
03:00:21,270 --> 03:00:22,650
What is this question?

4105
03:00:27,390 --> 03:00:29,810
That could apply to anyone, right?

4106
03:00:30,110 --> 03:00:30,670
Like...

4107
03:00:33,530 --> 03:00:35,690
I don't think that's an Akiba's trip reference.

4108
03:00:35,690 --> 03:00:37,630
I think that's just like, you know how...

4109
03:00:37,630 --> 03:00:39,510
Yeah, like Senran Kagura, you know?

4110
03:00:39,830 --> 03:00:41,230
Like, there's...

4111
03:00:41,870 --> 03:00:43,690
There's like a lot of games like that.

4112
03:00:43,790 --> 03:00:44,470
When there's...

4113
03:00:45,330 --> 03:00:47,950
When characters take damage, they lose...

4114
03:00:48,770 --> 03:00:50,630
Like, their clothes just tear apart.

4115
03:00:51,430 --> 03:00:51,890
Like, their clothes just tear apart.

4116
03:00:51,890 --> 03:00:53,030
That's why everybody...

4117
03:00:53,030 --> 03:00:55,030
If you're going into battle, just don't wear clothes.

4118
03:00:55,590 --> 03:00:56,050
Because...

4119
03:00:56,050 --> 03:00:58,490
If they're gonna tear apart anyway...

4120
03:00:59,690 --> 03:01:00,830
It would be...

4121
03:01:02,910 --> 03:01:05,670
It would be a waste to lose that.

4122
03:01:06,510 --> 03:01:07,550
That's a big brain.

4123
03:01:09,510 --> 03:01:11,030
Just don't wear them.

4124
03:01:12,870 --> 03:01:13,510
Don't look!

4125
03:01:27,790 --> 03:01:29,110
Where to put the sand?

4126
03:01:31,210 --> 03:01:32,030
Pocket sand?

4127
03:01:33,950 --> 03:01:35,390
Thank you for the vibe gifted!

4128
03:01:36,770 --> 03:01:38,130
I thought this emote...

4129
03:01:38,130 --> 03:01:39,270
Looked like Pantsu.

4130
03:01:39,530 --> 03:01:41,410
You and everybody else thought so, okay?

4131
03:01:43,970 --> 03:01:45,630
But when you put them all together...

4132
03:01:45,630 --> 03:01:46,270
It looks fine.

4133
03:01:52,290 --> 03:01:52,850
But when you put them all together...

4134
03:01:52,850 --> 03:01:53,550
Okay, guys.

4135
03:01:53,690 --> 03:01:54,310
I'm gonna go.

4136
03:01:54,430 --> 03:01:55,230
I'm gonna leave.

4137
03:01:55,630 --> 03:01:56,870
I'm gonna head out.

4138
03:01:58,130 --> 03:01:59,690
Tomorrow, no stream.

4139
03:02:01,070 --> 03:02:02,890
I got some stuff to do.

4140
03:02:03,030 --> 03:02:03,850
But also recording.

4141
03:02:04,190 --> 03:02:05,430
That's mainly the thing.

4142
03:02:05,490 --> 03:02:05,970
I'm recording.

4143
03:02:07,630 --> 03:02:08,190
So...

4144
03:02:08,190 --> 03:02:10,550
We are recording for the podcast!

4145
03:02:17,340 --> 03:02:19,800
Thank you guys again for watching today.

4146
03:02:20,520 --> 03:02:22,740
Thank you for hanging out with me as always.

4147
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:25,880
I really, really, really appreciate it.

4148
03:02:26,100 --> 03:02:26,140
I really, really, really appreciate it.

4149
03:02:27,760 --> 03:02:29,320
Thank you for that 20 gifted.

4150
03:02:29,400 --> 03:02:30,300
Thank you!

4151
03:02:30,380 --> 03:02:31,280
Thank you so much.

4152
03:02:32,180 --> 03:02:32,920
Thank you, Mint.

4153
03:02:33,140 --> 03:02:36,660
Thank you guys for always hanging out with me.

4154
03:02:36,800 --> 03:02:37,520
This was fun.

4155
03:02:38,300 --> 03:02:39,520
Peasant's quest was so silly.

4156
03:02:41,140 --> 03:02:41,540
And...

4157
03:02:41,960 --> 03:02:43,200
It was a good time.

4158
03:02:44,120 --> 03:02:45,000
I don't know.

4159
03:02:45,060 --> 03:02:46,220
I feel so awkward all of a sudden.

4160
03:02:46,380 --> 03:02:46,740
I don't know why.

4161
03:02:46,740 --> 03:02:48,260
Why do I feel so awkward?

4162
03:02:49,180 --> 03:02:50,200
I'm just gonna...

4163
03:02:51,260 --> 03:02:52,520
I'm just gonna go.

4164
03:02:53,300 --> 03:02:54,540
Like this way.

4165
03:02:55,840 --> 03:02:56,980
I'll see you guys...

4166
03:02:58,560 --> 03:02:59,860
When I see...

4167
03:03:00,620 --> 03:03:01,520
When I see you.

4168
03:03:02,380 --> 03:03:03,600
Maybe I'll go this way.

4169
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:04,740
Or this way.

4170
03:03:06,420 --> 03:03:07,320
I'm gonna...

4171
03:03:22,130 --> 03:03:22,690
Okay.

4172
03:03:23,230 --> 03:03:25,450
You guys can see yourselves out, right?

4173
03:03:25,830 --> 03:03:27,350
Good luck with your recording tomorrow.

4174
03:03:27,510 --> 03:03:28,110
Thank you!

4175
03:03:29,930 --> 03:03:30,410
Thank you!

4176
03:03:30,490 --> 03:03:30,990
Thank you!

4177
03:03:32,230 --> 03:03:32,590
Conqueror!

4178
03:03:36,510 --> 03:03:37,690
Actually, I'm gonna go...

4179
03:03:37,690 --> 03:03:38,050
Okay, wait.

4180
03:03:38,210 --> 03:03:38,910
You guys decide.

4181
03:03:39,110 --> 03:03:40,710
Are you gonna go out this way or that way?

4182
03:03:41,330 --> 03:03:42,890
Are you gonna go out...

4183
03:03:43,790 --> 03:03:44,150
Well...

4184
03:03:44,870 --> 03:03:46,970
Let's just say it's to the left or to the right.

4185
03:03:49,010 --> 03:03:49,990
Which way are you going?

4186
03:03:51,750 --> 03:03:53,010
Which way are you going?

4187
03:03:53,890 --> 03:03:54,250
Up?

4188
03:03:54,570 --> 03:03:55,950
No, you can't go up.

4189
03:03:56,470 --> 03:03:57,630
What are you, live in the rafters?

4190
03:03:58,330 --> 03:03:59,550
That's where the rats live!

4191
03:04:02,410 --> 03:04:02,810
That's where the rats live!

4192
03:04:02,810 --> 03:04:02,830
That's where the rats live!

4193
03:04:02,830 --> 03:04:03,590
That's my grandma.

4194
03:04:05,890 --> 03:04:06,730
Through the window?

4195
03:04:07,210 --> 03:04:08,270
Just show us the door?

4196
03:04:08,410 --> 03:04:08,590
No!

4197
03:04:09,210 --> 03:04:09,350
Just show us the door?

4198
03:04:09,350 --> 03:04:09,350
No!

4199
03:04:11,570 --> 03:04:12,630
I'm gonna go this way.

4200
03:04:12,670 --> 03:04:13,350
I changed my mind.

4201
03:04:15,210 --> 03:04:16,010
Wait, someone...

4202
03:04:17,130 --> 03:04:18,510
Someone said right.

4203
03:04:18,790 --> 03:04:19,030
Okay.

4204
03:04:19,690 --> 03:04:20,570
I'm going this way.

4205
03:04:20,730 --> 03:04:21,690
I'm going to the left.

4206
03:04:21,830 --> 03:04:21,950
I'm going this way.

4207
03:04:21,950 --> 03:04:21,950
I'm going to the left.

4208
03:04:22,690 --> 03:04:23,090
Okay.

4209
03:04:24,770 --> 03:04:25,870
Okay, don't follow me.

4210
03:04:26,330 --> 03:04:27,770
You guys said to the right.

4211
03:04:27,910 --> 03:04:29,230
So I'm gonna go to the left.

4212
03:04:29,230 --> 03:04:29,590
Okay?

4213
03:04:31,770 --> 03:04:32,590
Can't follow me.

4214
03:04:33,910 --> 03:04:34,830
How do I get out?

4215
03:04:34,890 --> 03:04:35,710
I'm stuck here now.

4216
03:04:36,010 --> 03:04:37,270
That's how I became a ghost.

4217
03:04:37,750 --> 03:04:38,150
So...

4218
03:04:40,130 --> 03:04:40,750
Not really.

4219
03:04:42,150 --> 03:04:43,090
Wouldn't that be crazy?

4220
03:04:43,470 --> 03:04:46,670
If you also got stuck in a maid cafe and then became a ghost.

4221
03:04:58,370 --> 03:04:59,210
Yeah, they're gone.

4222
03:05:00,530 --> 03:05:01,050
Uh-huh.

4223
03:05:02,330 --> 03:05:02,810
No.

4224
03:05:02,910 --> 03:05:04,710
I told them to go to the right.

4225
03:05:05,710 --> 03:05:06,190
Because...

4226
03:05:06,770 --> 03:05:07,550
You know...

4227
03:05:07,550 --> 03:05:09,410
That's the way to the fire pit.

4228
03:05:11,150 --> 03:05:12,090
They'll never know.

4229
03:05:13,410 --> 03:05:14,150
No, no, no.

4230
03:05:14,250 --> 03:05:15,430
I covered it really well.

4231
03:05:15,870 --> 03:05:18,330
They'll just fall right in, you know?

4232
03:05:20,270 --> 03:05:20,750
Yes.

4233
03:05:22,950 --> 03:05:23,430
Yes?

4234
03:05:23,430 --> 03:05:23,710
Yes?

4235
03:05:25,430 --> 03:05:25,510
No.

4236
03:05:27,050 --> 03:05:27,870
No, I forgot.

4237
03:05:28,010 --> 03:05:28,330
I forgot.

4238
03:05:28,330 --> 03:05:29,650
No, I forgot the...

4239
03:05:29,650 --> 03:05:31,850
Well, it's not that I forgot the piranhas.

4240
03:05:31,950 --> 03:05:34,050
It's that they just didn't do very well in the fire.

4241
03:05:34,190 --> 03:05:34,650
You know what I mean?

4242
03:05:35,010 --> 03:05:38,890
Okay, I will put in an order for...

4243
03:05:39,950 --> 03:05:40,390
robotic...

4244
03:05:40,390 --> 03:05:42,010
piranhas next time.

4245
03:05:42,110 --> 03:05:42,970
I'm very sorry.

4246
03:05:45,690 --> 03:05:46,310
Uh-huh.

4247
03:05:47,310 --> 03:05:48,490
No, they should be...

4248
03:05:49,370 --> 03:05:50,250
I'm listening...

4249
03:05:50,250 --> 03:05:52,050
I'm going to hear their screams...

4250
03:05:52,050 --> 03:05:53,210
any second now.

4251
03:05:57,360 --> 03:05:57,920
Hold on.

4252
03:06:03,640 --> 03:06:04,080
Oh.

4253
03:06:04,640 --> 03:06:05,080
Um...

4254
03:06:06,640 --> 03:06:07,360
One second.

4255
03:06:08,120 --> 03:06:10,620
You guys, you didn't go to the right!

4256
03:06:11,300 --> 03:06:11,960
Come on.

4257
03:06:12,080 --> 03:06:13,560
Okay, I'll lead you to the exit.

4258
03:06:13,640 --> 03:06:14,740
I'll lead you to the exit.

4259
03:06:15,260 --> 03:06:17,000
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

4260
03:06:17,660 --> 03:06:19,160
Why are you screaming?

4261
03:06:19,400 --> 03:06:21,140
No need to scream right now.

4262
03:06:21,380 --> 03:06:23,420
This way, this way, this way.

4263
03:06:23,720 --> 03:06:24,540
Yep, yep.

4264
03:06:25,040 --> 03:06:26,160
Just keep going straight.

4265
03:06:26,940 --> 03:06:27,920
Just keep going straight.

4266
03:06:29,320 --> 03:06:30,200
Okay, bye!

4267
03:06:31,900 --> 03:06:32,680
Bye-bye!

4268
03:06:36,560 --> 03:06:38,400
Okay, they're walking there now.

4269
03:06:40,920 --> 03:06:41,480
Yes.

4270
03:06:41,880 --> 03:06:43,180
I told them to...

4271
03:06:43,180 --> 03:06:44,900
Oh, actually...

4272
03:06:44,900 --> 03:06:47,640
Don't forget to go through...

4273
03:06:48,680 --> 03:06:49,880
the third door.

4274
03:06:51,600 --> 03:06:52,840
That's the correct one.

4275
03:06:53,200 --> 03:06:54,360
That's the one...

4276
03:06:54,360 --> 03:06:55,780
all the way on the right.

4277
03:06:55,880 --> 03:06:56,760
The third door.

4278
03:06:58,840 --> 03:07:00,720
I told them to go through...

4279
03:07:00,720 --> 03:07:01,660
the third door.

4280
03:07:01,800 --> 03:07:04,680
Even though the exit is actually through the first door.

4281
03:07:08,660 --> 03:07:09,030
Yes.

4282
03:07:09,780 --> 03:07:11,420
The second door...

4283
03:07:11,420 --> 03:07:12,860
The second door...

4284
03:07:12,860 --> 03:07:14,240
doesn't lead to anything.

4285
03:07:16,440 --> 03:07:18,120
It leads to...

4286
03:07:19,080 --> 03:07:19,820
Like...

4287
03:07:19,820 --> 03:07:20,940
It's like a...

4288
03:07:20,940 --> 03:07:22,440
wildy coyote.

4289
03:07:22,600 --> 03:07:25,540
It's just a painted road.

4290
03:07:25,940 --> 03:07:28,520
But the third one leads to the fire pit...

4291
03:07:28,520 --> 03:07:29,960
that they are about to fall in.

4292
03:07:30,020 --> 03:07:31,800
Any second now!

4293
03:07:32,660 --> 03:07:33,100
No!

4294
03:07:35,960 --> 03:07:39,520
Yeah, I'm going to hear their screams.

4295
03:07:39,600 --> 03:07:39,820
Hold on.

4296
03:07:40,140 --> 03:07:40,800
I'm listening.

4297
03:07:42,540 --> 03:07:43,240
I'm listening.

4298
03:07:46,620 --> 03:07:47,700
Oh, by the way...

4299
03:07:47,700 --> 03:07:48,620
Mr. President...

4300
03:07:50,860 --> 03:07:51,760
You're going to want to...

4301
03:07:51,760 --> 03:07:53,660
go through door number one.

4302
03:07:55,860 --> 03:07:56,300
Yes.

4303
03:07:57,620 --> 03:07:58,060
Yes.

4304
03:07:59,940 --> 03:08:01,580
Door number one.

4305
03:08:02,040 --> 03:08:03,620
Mr. President.

4306
03:09:00,380 --> 03:09:01,240
Otsu Minto!

4307
03:09:01,540 --> 03:09:02,440
Bye bye!

4308
03:09:02,700 --> 03:09:04,260
Thank you for watching!

4309
03:09:04,640 --> 03:09:06,120
Hang out with me!

4310
03:09:06,420 --> 03:09:07,360
See you!

4311
03:09:08,200 --> 03:09:08,960
Later!

4312
03:09:10,320 --> 03:09:11,440
Don't be a stranger!

4313
03:09:13,120 --> 03:09:14,080
Bye bye!

4314
03:09:14,420 --> 03:09:15,180
Otsu

4315
03:09:18,560 --> 03:09:18,800
Minto!

4316
03:09:19,780 --> 03:09:20,540
Otsu!

4317
03:09:21,680 --> 03:09:22,680
Otsu Minto!
