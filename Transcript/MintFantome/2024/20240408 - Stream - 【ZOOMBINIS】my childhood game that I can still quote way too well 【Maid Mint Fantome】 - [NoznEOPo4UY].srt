1
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,060
Not too long ago, Zumbini's enjoyed the good life.

2
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,480
Though they all looked slightly different, different eyes,
noses, air, heat.

3
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,200
Such differences meant nothing to the Zumbini's.

4
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:01,940
And so they lived happily on Zumbini Isle, making small,
useful products which were prized the world over.

5
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,780
The Zumbini's had a sense of fulfillment and inner peace,
not to mention healthy bank accounts.

6
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,140
What?

7
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,420
Then one day, who should show up?

8
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,920
But the bloats.

9
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,000
No, I hate those guys.

10
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,740
The bloats offered to help the Zumbini's grow their
businesses.

11
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,880
Expand their trade routes.

12
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,300
their quality of life.

13
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,660
Being trusting sorts, the Zumbinis agreed.

14
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,640
Oh wait, no, we do hate those guys!

15
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,080
They're bad guys!

16
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,720
But before long, the bloats had taken over everything.

17
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,480
No!

18
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,420
Stealing profits, cancelling holidays, high holidays!

19
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,800
Oh my god.

20
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,300
The Zumbinis were getting pretty stressed.

21
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,040
Oh, they're stressed.

22
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,700
Well, you can push them only so far before they take matters
into their own hands.

23
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,000
Viva la revolution!

24
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,840
Zumbinis!

25
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,760
Oh my god.

26
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,220
For so they decided to escape.

27
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,700
Escape.

28
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,680
And build a new home in a distant land.

29
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,880
Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.

30
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,040
Oh my gosh, sorry.

31
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,000
Hello, everybody.

32
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,480
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

33
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,000
Welcome.

34
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,060
Oh, I guess I could have gotten to this part and then
clicked watch intro.

35
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,320
But I wasn't sure if it would be okay.

36
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,940
So, hello, hello, hello.

37
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,640
Welcome to a Zoom.

38
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,260
Peace.

39
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,540
I love this game.

40
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,020
I love this game.

41
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,860
From my ghostly childhood.

42
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,600
When I was a Wii Wisp.

43
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,340
And I would play this game.

44
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,360
I would.

45
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,080
I can remember so many sound effects from this game.

46
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,020
I'm so sorry I'm going to be so annoying.

47
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,520
But this one is like I guess the remake.

48
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,620
I guess technically it's a remake.

49
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,080
And it has like new art.

50
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,100
And I don't.

51
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,740
I think that's it though.

52
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:45,220
to thank you like can you guys hear the don't know i turned
down the volume quite a bit because the zoom bini game was

53
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:54,680
so loud uh but i can hear them so i can see i can see your
stuff it cracks me up how much this of the story of zoom

54
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:04,520
binis went over my head as a kid yeah i i'll be honest i
remember them they having to leave i remember them having to

55
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,100
leave thank you for the don't know because

56
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,300
Because of something, I couldn't remember why.

57
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,160
It's actually missing some sound effects, I think.

58
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,960
Don't tell me that.

59
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,280
Don't tell me that.

60
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:19,940
I might cry.

61
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,200
I might actually cry.

62
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,200
They did that to me in Spiro.

63
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,800
There was like, it's the smallest thing in Spiro.

64
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,700
In Spiro 2, Ripto's Rage when they remade it.

65
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,160
And the one world with the guys that...

66
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,740
that do the ice skating, and there's the evil spirits that
you have to exercise.

67
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,720
They go, why I am?

68
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,640
Why I am?

69
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,980
They do that in the original, but they changed it for some
reason in the remake.

70
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't know why.

71
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,900
I don't know why.

72
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,300
It makes me so sad.

73
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,840
But, you know, it is what it is.

74
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,240
Here, I think at least the voices are the same, as you could
hear from Crunchy, narrator, San.

75
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,200
he sounds so the zoom beanies

76
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,740
that's what it talks like let's enter my name

77
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:29,850
we don't now i'm gonna have the smiley all right so this is
a game where we're little zoom beanies and if you don't know

78
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:37,070
what this game is yeah we're little well we're not we are
guiding the zoom beanies to salvation we are leading them

79
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:52,210
from the terrors of the working world to a new world where
they will have holidays again.

80
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:52,990
Yeah!

81
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,570
And, um...

82
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,850
Mm-mm-mm.

83
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,090
Do-no-do.

84
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,260
Boom.

85
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,120
I remember I used to sit on the screen because there would
be a crab.

86
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,600
Boom,

87
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,150
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

88
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,850
Okay, okay, okay.

89
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,610
Oh my god.

90
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,390
Ronin, thank you so much for the dono.

91
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:41,030
I don't know if you'll see this or not, but I want to know
that you inspired me to follow and support VTubers and

92
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,730
showed me the beautiful world of them.

93
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,890
I wouldn't be a VTuber fan today if it weren't for you.

94
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,390
My dear Kamioshi Mint Boss!

95
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,010
Sorry for taking time.

96
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,230
Not at all.

97
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,470
Thank you, Ronin.

98
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,670
You're, you know, if you found where you belong, you're not
a Ronin anymore.

99
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,750
Isn't that the case?

100
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,070
One of us, one of us.

101
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,310
Amy, thank you.

102
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,230
Tyranzo, thank you.

103
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,110
I love Zumbini's also fart.

104
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,410
So, where if you thank you, I start my new job tomorrow.

105
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,490
Congrats?

106
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,550
Oh my gosh!

107
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,050
Submit kips, thank you.

108

Usually I will read the donos at the end of the stream, so

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,270
Yes, thank you guys so much.

110
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:27,710
Thank you.

111
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,270
Okay.

112
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,050
Oh my gosh, we get to create our zumbinis!

113
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,810
Wait, what's the multiple dice versus the one dice?

114
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,310
Ah!

115
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:39,790
Ah!

116
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,550
Oh my god!

117
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,070
No!

118
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,250
No, no!

119
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,310
Go back into the hole!

120
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,810
Get back in your hole!

121
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,290
No!

122
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,070
What are these strangers?

123
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,650
No!

124
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,710
No!

125
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:53,990
No!

126
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,110
They don't stop!

127
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:55,930
Stop!

128
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,720
Stop it!

129
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,780
No!

130
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:18,570
Oh!

131
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:18,990
Oh!

132
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,270
Oh!

133
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:20,770
No!

134
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,910
I don't know who you are.

135
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,410
Get in there.

136
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:26,610
Oh!

137
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,910
Get in there.

139
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,070
I don't know who you are.

140
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,210
You are not welcome on my boat.

141
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,390
Can't get in there.

142
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:42,390
Sorry.

143
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,450
This is an exclusive club, okay?

144
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,250
Yeah, this is...

145
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,810
This is...

146
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,690
You know...

147
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:54,950
Okay.

148
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,730
Thank you so much.

149
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,070
idea what this game is about, but I look forward to find out
why this holds a special place in your heart.

150
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,790
Already starting strong.

151
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,070
I think the puzzles in this are a lot of fun.

152
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:23,790
I would have to say my favorite one would maybe be there's a
froggy one where you release little frogies and they have to

153
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,370
follow a certain path.

154
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,910
Wait, I can't name it myself?

155
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,670
Oh no!

156
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,930
I wanted to name...

157
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,790

Release.

186
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,020
Jernuaggy goes hard.

187
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,880
Kwaru is dead.

188
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,100
No, no, he's not.

189
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,240
No, he's not.

190
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,500

191
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,800

192
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,380

197
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,780
Let's do...

198
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,240

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,020
Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,960
Sounds like my name is Quaru now.

202
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:19,600
No.

203
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,340
Um.

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,080

Sneeflu.

206
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,380
Sneeflu!

207
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,480
Like I just walking.

208
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,800
Walk, walk, walk.

209
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,060
I'm going to call her walk.

210
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,520
Who am I missing?

211
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,400
We got flying, we got skating.

212
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,660
Okay, we need a lot of guys, though.

213
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,920
I'm very going to get this one random.

214
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,040
Lado!

215
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,620
Release Lato!

216
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,060
You and Pauline?

217
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,060
Red nose?

218
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,200
Oh, we do need a red nose.

219
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,780
Oh, yeah, we need a lot of colors for the future things.

220
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,940
Oh, we also don't have this hairstyle.

221
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
I think that...

222
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:05,720
Hi!

223
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,720
Emma!

224
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,080
It's EE!

225
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,700
Oh my gosh.

226
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,500
Hold on.

227
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:13,760
E!

228
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,940
It looks just like Emma.

229
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,840
So cranky.

230
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,960
Let's see what else do we need.

231
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,660
Rebruel!

232
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,070
What's wrong with E...

233
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,560
Rob Bracio!

234
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,420
I think they're siblings.

235
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,120
Denise!

236
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,260
You know what?

237
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,370
I am just gonna random...

238
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,270
random generate them now because...

239
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,540
Iggyagga!

240
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,860
Iggyag!

241
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,300
Iggyagga!

242
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:00,600
Muscus!

243
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,660
We need another Cyclops.

244
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,140
Cyclops.

245
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,180
Stay!

246
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,820
Wait, you have the same hair, though.

247
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,340
Let's give you this hair.

248
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,160
Two!

249
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,600
Thank you.

250
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,420
Oh my gosh.

251
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,260
It's been forever.

252
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:27,760
Hello.

253
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,540
There's zombies that was taken from the hole.

254
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,160
Neither truly a wisp nor truly a phantomie.

255
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,360
Stop.

256
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:39,880
Let's see what...

257
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,600
Oh, sorry.

258
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,900
Everyone's gotta be different.

259
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,140
Daffiro.

260
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,160
Um...

261
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,080
What other...

262
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,520
Oh, Kaisu!

263
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,920
Wait, we have a lot of...

264
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,540
Glasses.

265
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,020
Hold on.

266
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,300
What do we need more of?

267
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,100
We need more BDI people.

268
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,860
Fleens.

269
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,320
You're not fleens.

270
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,820
Well, Whatever you are.

271
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,460
Make me a pizza.

272
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,740
We have a couple sleepy eyes.

273
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,340
We need more beady eyes.

274
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:17,780
Come on.

275
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,580
Emiano!

276
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
How many more people can I have?

277
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,940
Thank you guys for all the donuts.

278
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,500
Thank you.

279
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,080
Oh, you don't even have a name.

280
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,500
Oh, oh, this is it.

281
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,760
This is the crew, everybody.

282
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,480
The journey begins here, Zumbini Isle.

283
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,420
Select traits to create a crew of 16 Zumbinis.

284
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,440
But remember, each Zumbini and this crew must be unique.

285
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,360
Oh my gosh.

286
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,600
Okay, guys.

287
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,120
I think it's time.

288
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,540
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom.

289
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, hey!

290
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,040
Do-do-do-do-doom, do-doom, do-doom.

291
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,710
Why is the music...

292
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:17,250
Just about by a stormy sea, the Zumbini's reached the shore
of a peculiar land.

293
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,510
Wait, that's a huge crab!

294
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,350
Okay, so our first puzzle is getting across the bridge.

295
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,710
Why was the crab so big?

296
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:32,650
Okay.

297
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:39,770
So this puzzle, each man...

298
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,890
This game is kind of creepy.

299
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,570
This game is a little scary.

300
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,150
So, why is there a face in that cliff?

301
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,530
That's what I'm about to tell you.

302
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,350
These cliffs are alive!

303
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,450
And they're also very picky.

304
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:03,510
So we have these bridges that the Zumbini's can cross either
one or the other.

305
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,950
So some traits this guy likes, but this guy doesn't like.

306
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,970
And we only have this number of tries.

307
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,750
to figure out where the Zoombie knees go.

308
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,610
So he's gonna sneeze.

309
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:16,690
Alright, Denise.

310
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,010
Let's check.

311
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,990
Let's try this way.

312
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,050
Okay.

313
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,270
That was fast.

314
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,910
Okay, so we'll put you over here.

315
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,970
But what trait did he not like?

316
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,650
They got a type.

317
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,390
Yeah, they do.

318
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:37,870
Sniffer.

319
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,370
Wait.

320
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:39,970
Okay.

321
00:19:41,670 --> 00:20:05,760
let's try the hair let's try the hair oh oh okay a simp a
soup Sigma cliffs look at even even the rocks have faces

322
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:17,680
does that mean the ground is alive too am I like stepping on
like this guy's got face this guy it's all faces okay So

323
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,160
maybe it's glasses, no glasses?

324
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,340
So glasses here?

325
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,260
You think?

326
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,000
Glasses?

327
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,220
Glasses?

328
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,220
Oh?

329
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,800
Oh?

330
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,480
Yo.

331
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,440
I think we're geniuses.

332
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,040
This children's game got nothing on us.

333
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,520
YAHOO!

334
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,920
Oh!

335
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,540
Oh!

336
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,440
Our theory has been debunked.

337
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:04,880
What?

338
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,140
Is it two eyes, one eye?

339
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,540
So everyone's going on this side.

340
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,920
What's wrong with Cyclopses?

341
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,840
Two eyes.

342
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,640
That would make sense because I put, I mean, with glasses,
you're going to have two eyes.

343
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,510
Yippee!

344
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,320
Oh my god, they're so loud.

345
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,600
I'm going to be adjusting the volume like crazy in this
game.

346
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,280
I'm so sorry.

347
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,100
How fortunate for Zumbinis that you are their guide.

348
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,280
Yes!

349
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:50,940
Me!

350
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,080
Oh wait, what is this?

351
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,940
Oh wait, oh no, no.

352
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,420
Stay with them.

353
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,060
Stay with them.

354
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,920
Stay with me.

355
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,920
Feeling stuck?

356
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,860
Don't worry, Brave Explorer.

357
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,880
all you have you have all the information you need to
complete this challenge and get all your zoom beanies

358
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,100
through take your time look for patterns and don't be afraid
to make mistakes allergic cliffs why are you allergic to my

359
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:16,840
zoom beanies if a few of our little blue friends are left
behind they'll be waiting at zoom beanie aisle oh no we

360
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:32,960
could have lost them okay first trial these Their own guards
have their rules, so do proceed with skill.

361
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,060
Zumbini's one guard won't allow.

362
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,460
The other guard surely will.

363
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,400
Okay, so it's similar.

364
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,660
It's similar like before.

365
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,460
Hello, Mint.

366
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:45,620
They're blue.

367
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,800
The floodgates are opened, it seems.

368
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,520
They're blue.

369
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,120
Um...

370
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,480
Okay.

371
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,940
They're blue!

372
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,260
What about it?

373
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,180
Actually, I'm green.

374
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,100
I'm mint.

375
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,180
A little bit of blue.

376
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,860
Okay, let's just...

377
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,880
Katie, you're up first, baby.

378
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,760
Oh!

379
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,230
Why are you so rude?

380
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,150
Okay, so basically it's the same as before.

381
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,450
Just a little bit more.

382
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,030
And if they like...

383
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,210
If they pound...

384
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,490
If they ground pound enough, the rocks will come flying
down.

385
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:51,150
so this way uh-uh this why you say it like that to my girl
katie okay okay thank you grandma well she didn't even say

386
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:58,450
anything okay so all right let's try the hair again let's do
hair again

387
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,250
Okay.

388
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:06,780
Jernuaggy.

389
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,050
Okay.

390
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,880
Hat or hair?

391
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,240
Well, I think that hairstyle or that one always has a hat.

392
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,460
Let's try ponytail.

393
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,820
Ponytail.

394
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:29,840
Ponytail.

395
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,360
Ponytail.

396
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,520
Yolto.

397
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,060
Yolto.

398
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,380
Yolto.

399
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Ghost laughter.

400
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,080
Yeah, that's the good stuff.

401
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
Let's see.

402
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,440
One of the chosen few.

403
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,080
Oh, you scared me for a second.

404
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,140
You scared me.

405
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,720
No, there's no chosen few.

406
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,920
All of my zombies.

407
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,940
Step in.

408
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,500
All of them are chosen.

409
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,080
All of them.

410
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,360
Granny Ada Ada.

411
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,480
Okay, let's see.

412
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,160
Let's get the sniffle right here.

413
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,100
Go ahead!

414
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,960
Go ahead!

415
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,680
I can't let you in.

416
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,760
That's so rude.

417
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,140
That's actually...

418
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,660
You can't just reject me for no reason.

419
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,360
Well, you're okay.

420
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,980
Everyone in this game is so superficial.

421
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,900
They all just judge on looks.

422
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,380
They judge on how our appearance, it's so messed up.

423
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,500
I'm glad that it's just hair, though.

424
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,360
It's pretty easy.

425
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,140
Okay, Dafferil.

426
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,500
Alrighty.

427
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,140
Look, Granny's got a harem.

428
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,520
Granny's got it going on.

429
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,460
You're sad.

430
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,780
You're a sad man.

431
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,700
What, do you want Frofa?

432
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,320
Uh-uh.

433
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,840
Uh-uh.

434
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,520
Okay, Frofa, try this way.

435
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,600
Oh my god.

436
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,120
Not all doors are open to you.

437
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,560
That's so rude.

438
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,140
Oh my gosh.

439
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,100
Gran, he's collecting them all.

440
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,260
Are you gonna have anyone?

441
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,760
Oh my god, he's so lonely.

442
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,040
Certainly.

443
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:23,960
Certainly.

444
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,700
He's just so grumpy.

445
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,540
I know.

446
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,380
It's so rude.

447
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,920
All right, Rebrisio, I believe in you.

448
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,560
Someone.

449
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,470
uh-uh uh-uh okay hold on this one this one

450
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:51,780
okay fine not all doors are open to you you deserve no one
you know what you can live your sad lonely life it's your

451
00:26:51,780 --> 00:27:01,380
fault you you shut yourself out from the world you beg for
touch but you're the one who doesn't allow it you beg for

452
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:08,780
someone to love you you wish that someone could just you
wish that you that someone would just come in but you shut

453
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:25,240
the door on everybody you tell him Emiliano you're our last
little guy I feel called out I feel attacked done quite well

454
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:38,460
you've done quite well how delightful thank you and so Our
brave travelers continue on through this dusty wasteland

455
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,260
until they meet.

456
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,980
Arno, the almost omnivorous, one very hungry pizza troll.

457
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,620
Yes, yes, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza!

458
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,820
Oh, fleens!

459
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,500
You're not fleens!

460
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,720
Wherever you are.

461
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,880
Make me a pizza!

462
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,540
Yes!

463
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:23,200
oh my gosh okay so basically we have to make him a pizza and
make it exactly as he likes um we don't know what he likes

464
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,460
so we just have to go combo by combo let's do cheese just
cheese

465
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,020
okay so if he throws it over here that means he doesn't like
any of the toppings but if If he throws it over here, that

466
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,060
means he'll still eat it.

467
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,720
So he does like the cheese.

468
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,080
More!

469
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,260
Topping!

470
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,040
Thank you!

471
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,840
Thank you for all the great past adventures here to many
more.

472
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,780
Thank you so much!

473
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,340
Thank you!

474
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,200
I was just trying to check out the stream on my break, but
things got way too real, way too fast.

475
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,120
I'm so sorry.

476
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,040
I gotta keep it real.

477
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:13,580
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,140
Okay.

479
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,200
More toppings?

480
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,540
Let's just do mushroom.

481
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:30,440
and eventually there's three guys something must go oh he
does not like the mushroom he's just like me for real for

482
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:40,520
real okay I like when he says there's something on that I
don't like it please I kind of want to put it mushrooms

483
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:54,860
again just so he says it there's stuff on that I don't like
oh he says it a different way though he's so cute the way

484
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:06,040
his mouth is so like wait wait his mouth is so hold on hold
on i could do that i could do that too it's so it's so

485
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:14,180
there's something i'm not i don't like

486
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:32,490
Okay, cheese, peppers, pineapple, no, pineapple, cheese,
pineapple, the goaded combination.

487
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,410
I know you love it, trunk man.

488
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,630
I know you love it.

489
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,030
Thank you, thank you.

490
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,410
Thank you.

491
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,910
You did it!

492
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,830
You saved them all!

493
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,910
I saved them!

494
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,190
Somehow, good job, whoever you are.

495
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:06,390
Eventually, if you get it wrong enough times, they'll punch
you, and your little Zumbinis will fly away.

496
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,530
Oh!

497
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,150
A camp!

498
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,010
It's so good.

499
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,590
The music is so awesome.

500
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,750
Hold on.

501
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,930
What's this?

502
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,270
A campsite with hot soup all ready to eat?

503
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:36,130
Looks like a fine place for Zumbinis to relax.

504
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:43,270
But when they're ready to move on, they'll need a group of
16 along the path.

505
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:43,830
16.

506
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,990
Yeah, so we have to keep our whole crew.

507
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:47,970
And this also boils.

508
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,090
I remember all the clicks.

509
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,390
I remember all the clicks.

510
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,190
Actually, that's the only two I...

511
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,330
Oh!

512
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,670
Let's change it to green, like me.

513
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:02,330
Oh.

514
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,650
More minting zone.

515
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,550
It's great seeing you be so passionate about the things you
love.

516
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,450
Man, the audio of this game brings back so many memories of
that era.

517
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,090
Right?

518
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,130
Now, we have to decide.

519
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,450
Which way do we go?

520
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,370
I'll be honest, I don't remember.

521
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,030
I don't remember which one leads to which path.

522
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,610
So we have to make a decision.

523
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:27,950
Corn soup?

524
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:28,910
I wish.

525
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,130
I'll be honest, when I would see this as a kid, I used to
think it was poison.

526
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,670
It doesn't look like a good soup.

527
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,570
It doesn't look...

528
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:38,590
Ah!

529
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,210
I don't like that.

530
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,630
He sounds too close.

531
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,370
He sounds so like in my head.

532
00:32:52,390 --> 00:33:05,350
ear didn't like that one this this one looks a little like
it's got a butt cheek okay guys let's make a poll let's make

533
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:12,750
a poll let's make a poll when I click out of the game you
won't hear it anymore so start a poll which direction

534
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:22,010
there's two I'm pretty sure there's another time when we get
to choose so left or I'll go up down check the map no no

535
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,110
we're in adventurers.

536
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,890
We are adventuring.

537
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,950
We don't know what the road will go to.

538
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,930
It's all about the discovery, baby.

539
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,870
Down for down bad.

540
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,250
Team up.

541
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,830
Adventurers also check their maps.

542
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,030
No, they don't.

543
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,970
Not the Zumbinis.

544
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:53,550
They are full of whimsy.

545
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,410
Okay, oh.

546
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,410
All right, it looks like it's up.

547
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:03,810
Let's go upward.

548
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:08,290
I think we're going through this game so quickly, we'll be
able to play again and we can go downwards next time.

549
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,430
Oh!

550
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:16,490
Oh!

551
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,210
Oh!

552
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:17,470
Oh!

553
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,010
Oh!

554
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,050

557
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:19,630

Oh my god, it's so soulful.

559
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,050
Wow, the art looks so good.

560
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,050
Welcome to the booth.

00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,150
Okay, so they have to have something in common.

590
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,780
Ah, sure!

591
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,180
Now a red nose.

592
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,020
Now a yellow nose.

593
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,600
But I'm probably gonna have to...

594
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,440
Switch it again, I think.

595
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,520
Wait, what do you have in common?

596
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,120
Oh, there we go.

597
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,680
Oh, there we go.

598
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,240
Ah, sure!

599
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,580
There you go, you got it.

600
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,380
Oh, I'm done!

601
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:31,400
Mr. Mr. Oh my god.

602
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,160
I could have left at any time.

603
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,880
I could have...

604
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,400
The frogs!

605
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,020
Flower and Lily bad shape too.

606
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,180
Maybe the kids could have just left them.

607
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,180
There.

608
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,380
We could have just left them.

609
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,560
That's so sad.

610
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,100
Oh yes!

611
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,980
Oh my gosh.

612
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,020
I love this one.

613
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,760
This one's so fun.

614
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,580
Okay, so each frog.

615
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,180
Froggy has a pattern, right?

616
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,440
And you have to, they can only go...

617
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,340
I don't... I think they can't go diagonal.

618
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,120
So they can only go...

619
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,840
You have to drop them on the correct spot.

620
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,540
That gets them to the other side.

621
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,300
So, like, say we go with the X guy.

622
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,560
But they can only be used a couple times.

623
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,340
Like, you can't say, like, oh, okay, let's have all 16
Zumbinis get on this one guy.

624
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:17,900
No, no, no.

625
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,100
Only, like, a certain amount.

626
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,460
So, it's like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

627
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,600
No.

628
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,660
See, we can't go that way.

629
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,120
Let's see if we do...

630
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,540
Boom, boom, boom.

631
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:40,740
boom boom no boom boom boom oh I don't think we can use the
X okay never mind okay next he I don't I think he's out I

632
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:48,760
think he's out let's try oh and then there's also like the
shape of the lily pad so boom boom boom boom boom boom boom

633
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,820
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

634
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,700
Boom, boom!

635
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,040
And they're very slow.

636
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,410
Where are you going?

637
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:31,350
Where are you going?

638
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,250
Where are you going?

639
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,410
Where are you going?

640
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,150
Where are you going?

641
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:37,250
Frog!

642
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:37,710
No!

643
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,470
No!

644
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:39,770
Frog!

645
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,060
Did you do this?

646
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,620
Wait,

647
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,140
maybe he'll make it eventually.

648
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,660
Okay, okay, this time.

649
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,740
This is the run.

650
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,640
This is the run.

651
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,740
Thank you guys, thank you so much!

652
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,340
I always thought it was a shame that you didn't get to use
this model much so seeing you come back with updated rigging

653
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:25,960
is awesome.

654
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,120
I'm so glad, thank you!

655
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,380
Ah!

656
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,320
Yes!

657
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,120
Yes!

658
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,680
Yes!

659
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,200
Yes!

660
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,100
Yes!

661
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,620
Yes!

662
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,460
Oh, oh no no no no!

663
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,740
Okay, nice, there we go.

664
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,320
It reminded me, oh my gosh, you know what that reminded me
of?

665
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:57,900
You know that video of the girl who's like watching someone
put the shapes in the holes and he's just like, this is a

666
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,820
rectangle shape.

667
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,500
What shape does it go into?

668
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,500
And she's like, the rectangle.

669
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,560
And he's like, that's right, the circle hole or the square
hole.

670
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,640
She's like, no, no, that's how I felt at that very moment.

671
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:22,860
okay do we put ourselves through actually i just realized
the yellow one is an absolute straight shot so let's just

672
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:34,820
there's no there's no room for error here yes just go go go
all the way also the blue one you can do multiples at a time

673
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:47,760
so there we go there we go the pink one also go but you
don't want them like running into each other so it's

674
00:41:47,760 --> 00:42:01,740
probably safer to do the colors together the teal one works
too you're so right oh my god speed run what about the red

675
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:07,740
one red also works there's oh my god frog mania

don't think there's a way for them to sink but if there were

678
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:49,020
if there were a way it would be really great yes there's
something about old games that just have like that they just

00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:42,600
Okay.

715
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,760
Last one, last one.

716
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:50,940
Beam.

717
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:52,480
Beam.

718
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,340
Yeah, I never played Pup Pud.

719
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,780
I only played one game of Freddy Fish and this.

720
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,820
I played Mist a little bit.

721
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,220
Did I understand Mist?

722
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,000
No.

723
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,500
But I played it.

724
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,280
I played it.

725
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,900
Well, I would watch my dad play Diablo.

726
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,060
And never Winter Nights.

727
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,000
Beam.

728
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:17,560
Beam.

729
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,380
Missed my beloved.

730
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:25,340
Bee!

731
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,340
Okay.

732
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,760
Thank you for the dono.

733
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,700
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

734
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,540
Oh, I remember this one.

735
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,760
These stoned hexes, if they can make the right connections.

736
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,100
The right connections.

737
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,960
I remember really liking the sounds in this puzzle.

738
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,520
Gosh, I love the frog ones so much.

739
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,340
Okay.

740
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,640
So this one, you just have to not be lonely.

741
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,300
Actually, this works perfectly because I only have two
people.

742
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,340
Oh, just kidding.

743
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:14,680
Um...

744
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,520
What do I do with him?

745
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,100
Well, I failed.

746
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,240
No.

747
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,600
Uh-oh.

748
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,140
Wait, Lato!

749
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,200
Sneiflu!

750
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:27,720
Oh!

751
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,580
Oh, sorry, Sneiflu.

752
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,040
Sorry, I didn't mean to burn your butt like that.

753
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:33,920
Daphro.

754
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:52,720

00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:51,630
You can have the same feet as him.

761
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:58,510
You can have the same nose as him.

762
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:04,290
And you guys can have the same hair.

763
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:12,550
But then we need... It's just the right difficulty.

764
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:40,630

Okay, and then, um, we gotta make this possible, you guys.

769
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,250
Okay, you, you guys have the same eyes.

770
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:28,890
You guys have the same eyes, so we'll take...

771
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:30,430
We'll die.

772
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:32,850
I'm just...

773
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,190
Same eyes.

774
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:36,610
Wait, what do you guys have?

775
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:39,870
You guys have the same eyes, too, but you don't have the
same fate!

776
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,130
Wait, I had it?

777
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,350
Oh, what did I do?

778
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,270
Wait, I had it?

779
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:47,750
I did?

780
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:48,710
Where?

781
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,050
No, I... Oh, same feet.

782
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,090
Oh, you're right.

783
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,070
Same eyes.

784
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,610
You've got them all through.

785
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:59,190
Good for you.

786
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,790
Remember at the beginning when I was like, we need a lot of
variety?

787
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:04,610
This puzzle's like this.

788
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:06,290
Yay!

789
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:17,650
You can leave without them.

790
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,230
It's kind of sad, though.

791
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,750
Flute goes hard.

792
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,200
Yeah, you can leave without all of them.

793
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:30,940
It's so sad.

794
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,840
Me win pattern recognition.

795
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:42,220
Another relaxing campsite ready and waiting for Zumbini's.

796
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,160
They'll meet their list.

797
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:51,560
The darkest, most dangerous, part of the journey is yet to
come.

798
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,260
I think we avoided the forest of the guys that are actually
trying to kill us.

799
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,180
So that's good.

800
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,740
I love this guy.

801
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,820
He loves his job.

802
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,020
Are there any other clickables?

803
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,160
Hey, that's just the same sound effect from the Oh.

804
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,260
I do remember those.

805
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:22,640
Ew.

806
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,780
This game is so goofy.

807
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,680
Wait, so now we're at the lions.

808
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:30,880
We have the lions.

809
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,800
We have the crystals.

810
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,160
We have another face matching game.

811
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:35,880
I think that's it.

812
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:44,160
Throughout these gloomy mountains, strange carvings left by
ancient peoples are everywhere.

813
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,440
Yeah, the bubbles, the bubbles.

814
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,040
The bubbles is the...

815
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:53,500
what's it called I think that I called it wait the

816
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:05,920
I don't remember this one oh I have to go in order of their
nose oh okay that's easy blue

817
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:26,170
green do they have to have something similar though oh I
guess they do what the wait so they have to have oh sorry I

818
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:28,930
just for some reason reason I was only looking at the eyes.

819
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:29,570
Okay, hold on.

820
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:31,530
Uh, oh no.

821
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,170
It's like a, it's like the same thing.

822
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:37,970
I missed the blue.

823
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:39,030
Oh, I did.

824
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:39,690
You're so right.

825
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:41,790
Thank you.

826
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:43,890
I don't even see it because it was like partially hidden.

827
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:45,930
Alright, so green.

828
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:50,070
Green.

829
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:52,730
Oh, I only have two left.

830
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:54,090
I'm throwing, you guys.

831
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:54,950
I'm throwing for real.

832
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:06,230
throwing for real when it comes to red yeah we can do this
guy and then this guy i don't know if there has to be a

833
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:12,210
similar thing to the previous person but we'll just do it
anyway red

834
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,300
splendid job thank you narrator

835
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:31,620
i'm so smart what are you throwing ball.

836
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,880
The ball in your court.

837
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,640
Oh my gosh, I love the sound in this one too.

838
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,020
You use the crystal filters to change the Zumbini's
reflection.

839
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,920
It will give them crystal slamming protection.

840
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:45,510
All of them are fun.

841
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,990
I felt like that lion one was a little too easy though,
right?

842
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,390
So just me, wow!

843
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,010
It looks so fancy now.

844
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,490
Oh my gosh.

845
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:57,890
Okay, so look.

846
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:05,330
We have to match the reflection Wait, but this is exactly
them.

847
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,470
Can I just put another guy on here?

848
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,060
But...

849
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,380
Wait, so if I do...

850
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:17,740
Hold on.

851
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,380
If I...

852
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,140
Is it...

853
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:24,860
If I combine?

854
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,600
Or do I have to have the same person?

855
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,200
No, I have to combine, right?

856
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,580
So we need a Cyclops with blue...

857
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:32,900
Nose.

858
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,020
Do we even have that?

859
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:36,560
No.

860
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:36,860
No.

861
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,960
Wait, I actually don't remember this one.

862
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,120
Match the characters, pull the lever.

863
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,840
Do they change each time?

864
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,740
Why is there a second seat?

865
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:52,060
Wait.

866
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,550
Oh, it does refresh.

867
00:56:59,190 --> 00:56:59,870
Wait, it didn't.

868
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:02,050
I don't remember.

869
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,490
I don't remember this one at all.

870
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,870
I remember it, but I don't remember it.

871
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:07,990
Why is there a second seat?

872
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:08,590
I think.

873
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:23,170
maybe for when you go through it again is what i'm thinking
of i think uh i think like round two right ping it refreshes

874
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:27,760
every two zoom beans okay okay so who's this is our guy

875
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:36,630
the sound reminds me of the indiana jones ride

876
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,560
Nice.

877
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,100
Who's our next victim?

878
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:54,820
This guy.

879
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,620
What's your name?

880
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:57,840
Muskus.

881
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,560
I'm Paco.

882
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:07,960
Him.

883
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:32,510
try putting two on it wouldn't it won't let me it won't let
me i've tried who is the next you like it won't even let me

884
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:41,890
drag it it won't even let me pick them up i think it's for i
think it's for a future future playthroughs because the the

885
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:45,050
puzzles do get like Not more difficult, but...

886
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,890
Well, I guess maybe it is a little bit more difficult.

887
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:51,510
They realize you level up as a gamer.

888
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:53,010
You know?

889
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:56,490
I'll show you what happens when you get one wrong, though.

890
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:01,890
It's so sad.

891
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:03,750
Oh!

No, there is no evidence.

Search first for traps.

I don't remember anyone after this.

997
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:39,570
Have we reached the promised land?

998
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:41,550

999
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:42,930

1000
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:43,810
Two.

1001
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:46,390
Could this be the place they'd been seeking?

1002
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:47,170
Three.

01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,580
a windmill.

1010
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:16,650
This windmill was wrought to honor the Zumbinius who calmed
Captain K.

1011
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:23,210
June, rode tattooed toads, and knew how to network when the
traveling was not so easy today.

1012
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:25,390
Look at our guys.

1013
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:26,510
Katie.

1014
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:40,030
This clock tower was constructed for the Zumbinius who
ambled past allergic cliffs, cruised on by stone-cold caves,

1015
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:43,370
and appeased Arno the almost omnivorous.

1016
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:47,520
Who are these people?

1017
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:57,990
Alright, guys.

1018
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:00,650

01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,050
16.

1025
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:38,650
We still have 384.

1026
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:39,510
Is that what that means?

1027
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:39,770
Wait.

1028
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:42,210
She's here!

1029
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:44,970
You guys, she is alive.

1030
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,030
Rebro!

01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:57,010
She's alive.

1034
01:08:58,210 --> 01:08:58,850
Man.

1035
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:01,950
She lives.

1036
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:07,930
We're fine.

1037
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:09,670
Oh, okay.

1038
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:10,250
My bad.

1039
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:13,430
The big, the bad, and the hungry.

1040
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,790
So now we're gonna go to the campsite.

1041
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:22,070
I thought there was another split, but I guess there's just
the one.

1042
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:26,130
So we have a whole other set of puzzles down here.

1043
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:27,650
Isn't that so exciting?

1044
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:36,680
Scroogey!

1045
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:50,290
Scroogey must live at all costs, you guys.

1046
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:53,350
If anything happens to Scroogey, I'm gonna cry.

1096
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,150
I said glasses, no glasses.

1097
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:47,730

Okay.

1101
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,010
It's not the hair.

1102
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:00,090
But they have nothing else in common.

1103
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:08,430

1104

It smells like a butter...

1116
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,050
Like a waffle.

1117
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:21,850
Like when you put butter on a waffle.

1118
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:23,590
Oh, it smells so good.

1119
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,130

Daiso.

1131
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,740
Don't let us down, Daiso.

1132
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:56,820
Very good Daiso.

1133
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:01,240
Mm-hmm.

1134
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:03,900
Okay.

1135
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,420
That sounds good.

1136
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,360
It's really good.

1137
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,160
Okay.

1138
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:14,520
Okay, we got through all the ones that we were sure of.

1139
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,540
What about you?

1140
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:19,580
No.

1141
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:22,420
No!

1142
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,000
Mm-hmm.

1143
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:28,800
Mm-hmm.

1144
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:31,720
You.

1145
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,340
You.

1146
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,700
He's allergic to...

1147
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,420
He's allergic to nerds, for real.

1148
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,160
Mm-hmm.

1149
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,400
You like glasses though.

1150
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,080
You're a man of culture.

1151
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:46,700
What about you?

1152
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,240
Not the...

1153
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,680
You're even allergic to...

1154
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,300
to Cyclops?

1155
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:56,580
It's so sad.

1156
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,320
You have no culture.

1157
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,700
Splendid job!

1158
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:04,640
Splendid job!

1159
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,000
Are these noses?

1160
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,320
I just... I can't tell.

1161
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:10,820
Hmm.

1162
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:17,480
These stone guards have their rules, so do proceed with
skill.

1163
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,100
With skill.

1164
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,580
Zumbini's one guard won't allow.

1165
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,000
The other guard surely will.

1166
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,240
Splendid.

1167
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,840
Strange looking bunch.

1168
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,540
Where do they all come from?

1169
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,740
Sorry, we just keep passing through.

1170
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:44,740
Alright, is he going to be so sad this time?

1171
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,720
Can't let you in.

1172
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:50,400
Why not?

1173
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:51,860
Why?

1174
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,640
Like, I need...

1175
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,460
Come on.

1176
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:54,940
Sure.

1177
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,040
Okay,

1178
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:02,800
let's try the glasses.

1179
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:04,460
Enjoy yourself.

1180
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,120
Oh!

1181
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,900
I mean...

1182
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:10,720
What?

1183
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,100
He has friends.

1184
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:26,240
now maybe this he had a change of heart is it glasses is he

1186
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:45,580
wait that means we must be selective about our clientele
what does that mean What's wrong with A-Floak?

1187
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:46,400
Huh?

1188
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,640
I think you're just being very discriminatory.

1189
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:49,620
Don't be shy.

1190
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,220
I kind of...

1191
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:55,920
I think I'm...

1192
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:58,740
I think I like the rock.

1193
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:04,800
I think I'm like, wow, for this...

1194
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,000
Okay.

1195
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,240
Have a good time.

1196
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:07,240
Thank you.

1197
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,040
I mean, he's just got a bit of a career...

1198
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,580
I think I misjudged him before.

1199
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:12,340
You know?

1200
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:13,720
Oh.

1201
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:19,370
So it's hair.

1202
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:22,250
It's not the eyes.

1203
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,190
Go ahead.

1204
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:27,630
Enjoy yourself.

1205
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:29,590
Yeah!

1206
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:31,890
Okay, so it's the hair instead.

1207
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:35,050
So these guys, messy hair and ponytail.

1208
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:36,130
Messy hair?

1209
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:37,130
Or, uh...

1210
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:37,350
Sure.

1211
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,390
I don't know.

1212
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:40,730
I don't even know what to call that.

1213
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:42,150
What?

1214
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:44,570
A single strand?

1215
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:45,690
Hello.

1216
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:51,670
When can we start sending the Aka Supas?

1217
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:55,750
Why are you so eager to do that?

1218
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:58,870
But also, I think it might be...

1219
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:03,130
I think it might be a little wild because YouTube says that
I need more watch hours.

1220
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:07,970
So even after today's stream, I'm not so sure.

1221
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:09,550
Okay.

1222
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:10,370
So Pru.

1223
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:14,130
Wait.

1224
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:15,270
And so these are the guys, too.

1225
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:15,690
Daiso?

1226
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:17,790
Thank you.

1227
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:18,690
Oh, my gosh.

1228
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:20,730
He's just got so much charisma.

1229
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:21,910
You know?

1230
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:22,230
Sure.

1231
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:24,010
Thank you, sir.

1232
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:24,870
Oh, my gosh.

1233
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,670
Wait, it's literally the opposite.

1234
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:27,590
Hello.

1235
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:30,310
It's the opposite of last time.

1236
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:31,470
Okay, by me.

1237
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:31,990
Don't be shy.

1238
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:37,940
Sure.

1239
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,060
Okay, it's the other side.

1240
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:42,980
Oh, my God.

1241
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:44,040
Hello.

1242
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:44,720
Okay.

1243
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:47,960
Hip hip zoobini!

1244
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:48,960
Hip hip zoobini!

1245
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,140
Hip hip zoobini!

1246
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:59,180
I love, I love the, this is okay, this is where the cool
kids club, look how cool they look and this is everybody

1247
01:19:59,180 --> 01:19:59,680
else.

1248
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,180
The narrator is the best guy ever.

1249
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:03,280
Hip hip hip zoobini!

1250
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:12,440
And so our brave travelers continue on through this dusty
wasteland until they meet Arno, the almost omnivorous.

1251
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,520
one very hungry pizza troll.

1252
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,100
One hungry pizza troll.

1253
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:19,320
Fleeings?

1254
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:21,980
You're not fleens.

1255
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,240
I think we're still on easy mode.

1256
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,020
Whatever you are.

1257
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,200
Make me a pizza.

1258
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:32,800
Okay.

1259
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,560
Oh, it's up to you, buddy.

1260
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,300
All right, we're gonna go down the line.

1261
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,720
Actually, we're gonna make this a little interesting.

1262
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,380
You know, we're gonna try two combos at once.

1263
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:53,100
Something on that I don't like.

1264
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:04,290
Sometimes he will actually just get like a plain ass, like
no cheese pizza.

1265
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,510
He said the thing.

1266
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:12,530
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more,
more.

1267
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:13,310
Okay.

1268
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:17,950
He's begging for it.

1269
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:20,410
Sorry, mister.

1270
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:21,770
Okay, so he doesn't like mushrooms.

1271
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:25,510
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more,
more, more, more, more, more.

1272
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:28,970
That's how you really get the girls, you know?

1273
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:33,150
I'm supposed to be working, but this child's game is too
engaging.

1274
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:35,730
Go work.

1275
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:38,990
Okay.

1276
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:40,830
Bellbuckers.

1277
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:45,030
Wow, only three children.

1278
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:45,790
He tries!

1279
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:47,410
I think we're a genius.

1280
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:57,410
I think we're a genius.

1281
01:21:57,670 --> 01:21:59,710
You've done quite well.

1282
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:00,430
Thank you.

1283
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:01,410
Oh, sorry narrator.

1284
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:18,430
Ah, base cap one.

1285
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:20,110
What's this?

1286
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:21,930
Okay, bye bye.

1287
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:23,600
Nope.

1288
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:24,370
Nope.

1289
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:26,870
We are no time to stop, Zubinis.

1290
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:28,950
No, no rest.

1291
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,090
No rest allowed.

1292
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:33,610
There's no sense leaving it up to chance.

1293
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:37,110
Lower the fleens off the tree branch.

1294
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:39,490
The fleens are the guys actually trying to kill us.

1295
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:42,870
The fleens?

1296
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:45,950
These guys.

1297
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:48,710
These guys are actually trying to kill us.

1298
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,390
Woo, woo, woo, woo.

1299
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:54,370
Okay, so...

1300
01:22:54,390 --> 01:23:02,650
So, you have to put a guy out and have...

1301
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:04,230
I don't remember how this one goes.

1302
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:10,530
I think certain traits a Zumbini has will have a certain guy
jump off.

1303
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:13,190
But you need these guys to jump.

1304
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:14,190
I don't remember how this one...

1305
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:14,590
Wait, Yulman.

1306
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:17,850
There's no sense leaving it up to chance.

1307
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,850
Lure the fleens off the tree branch.

1308
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,150
Oh, yeah, we are not so easy.

1309
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:23,050
Feeling stuck?

1310
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:23,590
Wait, no.

1311
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:24,370
No, we're going to...

1312
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:25,190
We're gonna get this ourselves.

1313
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:27,650
We don't, we don't, I'm sorry, I didn't read it.

1314
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:31,950
You are fleens.

1315
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:32,910
No, we're not.

1316
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:35,590
The tree guy just said fleens.

1317
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,950
You're not fleens.

1318
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:39,050
We're Zubini's.

1319
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:40,370
We're not the fleens.

1320
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:42,830
These are the fleens.

1321
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:50,610
They are so high tech for like, is this, is this Metal Gear?

1322
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:56,540
I like that sound.

1323
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,620
Man, I hated this one.

1324
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,640
I don't remember how it works, so...

1325
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,680
No, no, Scrooky.

1326
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:04,960
Scrooky, get behind me.

1327
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:05,900
Scrooky, goodbye.

1328
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,840
Scrooky, stay back there.

1329
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,040
Okay, we're gonna get a Floak.

1330
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:29,380
Okay, so basically we only have a couple chances because
they're gonna slide eventually and fall off the thing.

1331
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:31,720
So...

1332
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:33,740
Maybe...

1333
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:42,860
it was either her glasses or the color of her nose or okay
so aggressive I know the fleens are crazy let's try one

1334
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:43,880
completely different

1335
01:24:54,280 --> 01:25:07,760
okay the hair is correct the hair was correct yes oh okay so
we need you like Agla.

1336
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:12,260
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1337
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:15,480
Okay, okay.

1338
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:17,440
Okay.

1339
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,820
So, we need...

1340
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:22,360
No.

1341
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,460
No, no, Skruki.

1342
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:25,720
No, no, no.

1343
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,440
No, no, no.

1344
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:29,620
No, no, no.

1345
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:30,400
I won't allow it.

1346
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,480
I won't allow it.

1347
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:33,260
Uh-oh.

1348
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,880
Oh, that's right.

1349
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:43,380
Wait, how am I supposed to get the right?

1350
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:46,340
No, Scrookie.

1351
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:48,160
No, no, Scrookie.

1352
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:52,360
No, no, Scrookie.

1353
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:55,400
Daiso!

1354
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,040
Oh!

1355
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,040
Scrookie, no!

1356
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,300
Yep, because it's the same.

1357
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:07,720
legs.

1358
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:09,180
Oh my god.

1359
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:09,880
Oh my god.

1360
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:10,180
No.

1361
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:10,920
Scrookey.

1362
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,260
Scrookey has to go.

1363
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:18,760
Scrookey has to go.

1364
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:20,440
Scrookey.

1365
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:21,560
He's looking around.

1366
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:22,640
He doesn't even want to look at me.

1367
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:23,400
He's so scared.

1368
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:28,420
He's like, mom, mom, what are you picking me up for?

1369
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,340
Mom, why are you leading me over into the danger zone?

1370
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,330
Mom, mom, I'm scared.

1371
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:41,550
No, Please, please, Mom, you said you would protect me!

1372
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:45,490
Scrooky!

1373
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,650
Here comes the awesome music, yeah?

1374
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:56,860
Yeah!

1375
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:08,560
All right, Scrooky in the lead!

1376
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:12,800
Nice.

1377
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,700
Hurry, zoom penis!

1378
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:18,520
Oolah, the forest's foremost.

1379
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:24,100
and perhaps only, band leader is about to begin rehearsals.

1380
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:28,800
She'll be closing the hotel for the night, so scamper into a
room.

1381
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,440
Okay, we believe in Skrookie.

1382
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,040
I don't remember how this one was.

1383
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:34,240
Yes.

1384
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,940
Ah, yes.

1385
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:39,060
I'll be right down.

1386
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,160
Make yourself cozy.

1387
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,200
Yeah, but you're also picky.

1388
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,880
Just when I was starting rehearsal.

1389
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,860
You're just in time for tomorrow's concerto.

1390
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:50,400
Okay.

1391
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,580
Help yourselves to a room.

1392
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:54,220
I got rehearsal.

1393
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:55,200
Go ahead.

1394
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:56,660
Find yourselves a room.

1395
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:57,880
Where did she go?

1396
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:01,220
Why did she talk to over herself even?

1397
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:11,610
Thank you.

1398
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:15,610
Thank you so much.

1399
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:17,250
Thank you.

1400
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:20,290
Thank you.

1401
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:21,430
Okay, so...

1402
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:27,340
Alright?

1403
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:31,140
Oh my god, who's sharing a room with Screw Key tonight?

1404
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:31,740
Oh!

1405
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:33,140
No!

1406
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:35,560
Oh.

1407
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:38,600
And we do have, like, a kind of...

1408
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,720
That clock is terrifying.

1409
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:42,420
Oh my gosh.

1410
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:47,720
The clock is giving, like, over-the-garden-wall vibes.

1411
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,720
It's so scary.

1412
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:52,260
Let's put you over here.

1413
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:54,460
Oh.

1414
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,260
Is it the eyes?

1415
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,360
Okay.

1416
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,360
I don't remember what.

1417
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:06,220
Is it the eyes?

1418
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,300
Is it eyes?

1419
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:12,980
Is it just eyes?

1420
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:18,330
Is that it?

1421
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:19,930
Is it so simple?

1422
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:21,430
Am I overthinking it?

1423
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:26,170
Am I overthinking it?

1424
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:27,550
How do I do it with everything?

1425
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:30,990
I think so.

1426
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:39,390
because there's only this yeah there's only five slides I
guess I could have made it anything maybe I could have made

1427
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:55,150
it eyes I could have made it hair I sorry my my said hair
and so I put him in there oh Rian is all by themselves so

1428
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:55,710
Sorry.

1429
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:58,150
Oh my god, it's spooky.

1430
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:00,110
Just look at the time.

1431
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:01,050
Gotta split.

01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:10,600
See you in the morning.

1434
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:19,820
This is the paint splatter one!

1435
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:27,460
Strike the targets one and all and watch for a pattern on
mud ball walls.

1436
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,600
Mud Ball Wall.

1437
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,840

Wait, I don't remember how to do this one, though.

1446
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:49,780
Wait, I don't remember how this one works.

1447
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:53,180
So we pick a color.

1448
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:55,940

Hurry up.

1459
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:14,820
Of the demo I played as a kid, this was my favorite.

1460
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,660
They all had a demo of this.

1461
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:19,500
They had a demo of this.

1462
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,120
Nice.

1463
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,240

so funny okay i think we can we basically have all the

1465
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:52,900
information we need to to complete this piece of cake baby
well except for this one everything else piece of cake

1466
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:07,580
have no idea how this works okay so each row is a color and
each column is a shape so you just have to see these are

1467
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:21,600
star shapes these are triangle shapes see it's not so let's
try green i don't know i'm feeling green oh okay this is a

1468
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:29,380

think it might be pink.

1469
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:31,360
Genius.

1470
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:35,720
Genius.

1471
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:41,980
Nailed it.

1472
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,240
And look, and you run out of ink.

1473
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:50,120
See here?

1474
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,620
You can run out, so it could be... Oh my gosh.

1475
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:56,900
Can you imagine if Scrooky was left behind?

1476
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,840
I don't even want to think about the plot.

1477
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:14,500
I don't even think about the thought yay well done no wise
and trusted guide thank you i'm wise and trusted you guys

1479
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:24,740
how do you get ink refills you don't if you run out of ink
you just have to leave them behind

1480
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:52,850
it's coast so hard amazing indeed she's gonna have to stay
here relaxing campsite ready and waiting for zoom bini's

yet to come

1482
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:11,410
Swap her in?

1483
01:35:11,610 --> 01:35:12,750
Nah, she's good.

1484
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:21,310
Throughout these gloomy mountains, strange carvings left by
ancient peoples are everywhere.

1485
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:25,050
Spooky.

1486
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:27,050
Oh my gosh.

1487
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:29,810
Okay, next time we play this, we're going to go on hard.

1488
01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:30,470
Should we...

1489
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:32,270
We'll just go on the hardest mode, I think.

1490
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:33,710
Oh!

1491
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:36,390
What the heck is that?

1492
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:39,510
Oh!

1493
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:40,750
Oh, those are the hair.

1494
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:43,650
So it's like this hair.

1495
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:46,530
We have a lot of these guys.

1496
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:48,530
We have so many single hairs.

1497
01:35:51,670 --> 01:35:52,470
And then ponytail.

1498
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:54,790
Right?

1499
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:55,510
That is a pony.

1500
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:56,710
And this is the high.

1501
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:57,310
Okay, okay.

1502
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,890
We have one pony.

1503
01:35:59,090 --> 01:36:00,030
Oh, two ponytails.

1504
01:36:02,230 --> 01:36:04,650
And we have...

1505
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:06,610
Actually, I want to see.

1506
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:08,790
Oh, they don't need to be...

1507
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:16,230
connected to one another to one another so that makes things
so much easier I was making things more difficult on myself

1508
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:31,610
than it really needed to be I think you all know who's gonna
be in the front our man Scroogey wait his name is Scroogey I

1509
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:39,850
thought his name was Scroogey it's Scroogey this whole time
you lied to me you did it you saved I thought it was

1510
01:36:39,850 --> 01:36:43,790
Scroogey What?

1511
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:46,170
Just Sruki?

1512
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:54,870
She finally noticed.

1513
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:59,770
Use the crystal filters to change the Zumbini's reflection.

1514
01:37:00,490 --> 01:37:03,370
It will give them crystal slamming protection.

1515
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:04,950
Let's just pretend he's still Sruki.

1516
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:10,030
Girl, boss, gaslit herself.

1517
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:18,730
I cannot believe that I just...

1518
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:24,070
That I just made that up.

1519
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:27,510
I stole their identity, like I stole...

1520
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:33,430
This whole time, they probably just like...

1521
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:35,690
She can't even get my name right.

1522
01:37:38,350 --> 01:37:40,230
Gosh, this mid girl sucks.

1523
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:41,730
She can't even...

1524
01:37:43,510 --> 01:38:03,990
read sorry yeah he's still scrooky in our hearts right guys
scrooky scrooky scrooky scrooky scrooky literacy is

1525
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:09,350

01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:21,790
Sruki in the streets.

1527
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:24,090
Sruki in the streets.

1528
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:27,370
Sruki did have that.

1529
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:30,490
Wait, we need to ask who was it her?

1530
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:31,970
Koldio.

1531
01:38:32,450 --> 01:38:35,650
How was he in the in the hotel room?

1532
01:38:35,790 --> 01:38:36,190
I wonder.

1533
01:38:37,510 --> 01:38:37,990
Hmm.

1534
01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:41,030
Hmm.

1535
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:42,730
Hmm.

1536
01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:51,710

Edutainment games proving its value by finally teaching
victory.

01:39:04,630 --> 01:39:06,490
Just notice that you had a messy...

1541
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:07,990
Sorry, I missed this one earlier, AJ.

1542
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:11,750
You have messy hair, sunglasses, red nose, spring zoomini in
your party.

1543
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:12,530
This one?

1544
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:15,610
That combo was always my favorite as a kid.

1545
01:39:15,730 --> 01:39:17,690
I think his name was Ida Wonka.

1546
01:39:18,650 --> 01:39:30,070
even remember his name wow true Zumbini fan my favorite
combo was uh glasses and this hair and the um either the

sorry.

1549
01:39:50,590 --> 01:39:52,050

1550
01:39:54,630 --> 01:39:54,990
Um...

1551
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:56,770
Favorite hair color?

1552
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:02,130
You can't change the hair color.

1553
01:40:05,770 --> 01:40:06,390
Right?

1554
01:40:09,850 --> 01:40:10,570
Um...

1555

Oh, that's your favorite!

1556
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:19,500
Oh, nose color!

Oh, it was blue!

1558
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:22,340
It's blue.

1559
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:33,630
Why does this get more difficult for me?

1560
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:35,550
The less Zumbinis I have.

1561
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:37,980
Why can't I find him?

1562
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:40,570
Hello?

1563
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:43,200

the last time i tried playing it the game crashed on me so i
never actually got to beat it

1574
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:22,140

zoom bennies across bubble wonder abyss

1575

01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:37,380
them from them blue and decorate them like zoom bennies We
found one under the porch when my parents moved from a

1577
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:40,160
family home when they retired 30 years later.

1578
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:41,540
Oh my gosh.

1579
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:43,060
That's insane.

1580
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:46,420
Wait, this is the same exact pattern as before.

1581
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,280
Okay, so all our scruffy heads.

1582
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:51,180
Scruffy.

1583
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:56,080
I'm going to turn this one down because it does hurt.

1584
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:57,640
Scruffy.

1585
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:02,980
Scruffy.

1586
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:09,040

this way they will immediately go in so they have to go the

1589
01:43:52,170 --> 01:44:04,130
other way but uh-oh we have a lot of single men um I

place of hope and prosperity.

1609
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:14,540
Prosperity.

1610
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:23,400
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I deprived you of that
magnificent performance originally.

1611
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:24,660
I'm so sorry.

1612
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:26,840
Zumbini.

1613
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:32,180
Oh, we got a school and little houses.

1614
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:34,740
A school house.

1615
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:40,400
So it's the Zumbini's who flushed the finicky fleens and in
hotel dementia.

1616
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:47,260
had pleasant dreams and catapulted cleanly over mudball wall

1617
01:46:51,100 --> 01:47:08,100
what else what's this one this bowling alley honors I love
how we just escape like this terrible situation that the

1618
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:18,780
Zumbinis are in and their first thought is just like um yeah
we need a bowling alley like maybe a supermarket like you

1619
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:29,600

1622
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,080
Thank you.

1623
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:49,280
We're playing Zumbinis.

1624
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:55,320
So the Zumbinis finally reached their new home.

1625
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:58,220
They established a nation of Zumbinis for Zumbinis.

1626
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:00,860
This independent nation would later be known to...

1627
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:01,640
Very nice, isn't it?

1628
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:05,140
But don't you have a job to do?

1629
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:08,060
Zumbinis to free...

1630
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:12,200
Did he just say this is good, isn't it?

1631
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:15,420
You can't just say that in front of me.

1632
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:18,100
Alright, guys.

1633
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:21,300
How do I change the difficulty?

1634
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:24,740
How do I make it more difficult?

1635
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:26,440
Options?

1636
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:28,360
No.

1637
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:30,980
Oh, we have on-screen captions?

1638
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:32,720
I should have done that before.

1639
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:35,900
Hmm.

1640
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,300
Do I have to do it on practice?

1641
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,000
Oh!

1642
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:45,140
Very, very hard.

1643
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:46,740
Oh my god.

1644
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:50,960
I'm scared.

1645
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:56,280
I don't think I've ever done it this hard before.

1646
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:02,100
Now we're doing difficult mode.

1647
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:05,320
We don't know a single...

1648
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:08,020
We can't, we can't, we can't cater to our...

1649
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:08,880
Actually, hold on.

1650
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,340
I'll make my favorite, though.

1651
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:12,800
Okay.

1652
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:13,980
There we go.

1653
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:15,980
Okay, the rest are all random.

1654
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:18,440
There, they...

1655
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:19,320
Why do they all look the same?

1656
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:20,420
Okay, stop it.

1657
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:25,120
Ding.

1658
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:29,240
Can't remember a single day in Hotel Dementia for some
reason.

1659
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,300
Go for it, I believe in your mint.

1660
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:35,080
Okay.

1661
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:36,700
Let's go.

1662
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:37,960
I didn't change it.

1663
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:38,180
Wait.

1664
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:39,980
What do you mean I didn't change it?

1665
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:51,920
it's on very hard oh but here see it won't let me change it
i'm clicking i'm clicking but it won't let me change it oh

1666
01:49:51,920 --> 01:50:04,590
oh oh sorry sorry i didn't mean to abandon you guys okay how
am i supposed to change it oh they level up the more you do

1667
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:19,910
it so this is just me practicing the each one okay i get it
i get it i have to grind to get to very very hard I'm so

1668
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:20,770
curious though.

1669
01:50:21,310 --> 01:50:23,030
How is it so hard on the pizza one?

1670
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:24,090
Okay, let's just do the prep.

1671
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:28,010
Pizza for lunch and snack and dinner and dessert.

1672
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:32,110
Baby would satisfy me.

1673
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,040
Pizza time.

1674
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:44,040
Pizza time.

1675
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:47,000
Okay.

1676
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:49,980
Satisfy me.

1677
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:50,340
Okay.

1678
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,700
So let's look at what's NG.

1679
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:56,360
There is no ice cream.

1680
01:50:56,860 --> 01:50:58,540
Okay, ice cream by itself is NG.

1681
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,280
So it's gotta be chocolate ice cream.

1682
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,600
It's gotta be chocolate ice cream.

1683
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:10,300
Cheese.

1684
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:12,780
Doesn't like mushrooms.

1685
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:17,000
Here, let's just try a bell pepper.

1686
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:22,780
Make me a pizza.

1687
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,320
Something must go.

1688
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:26,940
Oh, okay.

1689
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,340
That topping, not for meatbags.

1690
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:30,220
Not for meatbags.

1691
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:31,050
Uh-oh.

1692
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:37,680
Okay.

1693
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:44,100
Maybe it's not even the cheese.

1694
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:48,220
They don't all like the same thing.

1695
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:52,080
There's stuff on that I don't like.

1696
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:53,400
Sorry!

1697
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:54,220
That topping?

1698
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:55,000
No.

1699
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:56,740
Uh-oh.

1700
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:58,100
Uh-oh.

1701
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:02,760
I feel so much pressure right now.

1702
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:05,640
Okay, so maybe it...

1703
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:05,900
Okay.

1704
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:12,170
Just the pineapple?

1705
01:52:17,370 --> 01:52:18,870
Don't kick him out.

1706
01:52:19,370 --> 01:52:19,850
More!

1707
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:20,450
More!

1708
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:22,130
That topping?

1709
01:52:22,570 --> 01:52:23,330
Not for me, thanks.

1710
01:52:24,290 --> 01:52:24,770
Uh-oh.

1711
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:26,610
Okay, so it's...

1712
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:27,890
Probably...

1713
01:52:27,890 --> 01:52:29,750
Okay, so she doesn't like pineapple at all.

1714
01:52:30,330 --> 01:52:31,270
Wait, so maybe...

1715
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:33,350
Can I do like a pineapple...

1716
01:52:34,410 --> 01:52:35,290
Like sausage?

1717
01:52:37,990 --> 01:52:39,690
Oh no, I forgot the chocolate!

1718
01:52:40,110 --> 01:52:40,370
Oh no.

1719
01:52:40,910 --> 01:52:42,570
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1720
01:52:42,970 --> 01:52:45,070
There's stuff on that I don't like!

1721
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:47,250
Why do you not like the vanilla ice cream by itself?

1722
01:52:47,410 --> 01:52:48,490
But you're fine with it with chocolate!

1723
01:52:51,710 --> 01:52:52,590
Something's wrong!

1724
01:52:53,870 --> 01:52:54,550
Something's wrong!

1725
01:52:57,930 --> 01:52:59,570
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1726
01:53:00,850 --> 01:53:02,050
Didn't like the peppers.

1727
01:53:02,670 --> 01:53:04,290
No, I don't think he liked the cheese.

1728
01:53:04,870 --> 01:53:06,610
Something must go.

1729
01:53:07,970 --> 01:53:10,110
There's something there I won't eat.

1730
01:53:12,210 --> 01:53:15,630
Uh-oh, there's something on that I don't want.

1731
01:53:16,210 --> 01:53:24,110
The guy on the right looks like he would, like, put his
fingers together and be like, Oh, go me, ooh.

1732
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:32,260
Maybe it's sausage.

1733
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:36,300
Just peppers, I think?

1734
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:41,970
No, but he liked the pineapple.

1735
01:53:43,530 --> 01:53:45,430
He didn't like just the peppers, right?

1736
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:46,570
We tried that.

1737
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:50,490
No pineapple.

1738
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:52,350
But this guy likes the pineapple.

1739
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:58,930
She doesn't like pineapple, I think.

1740
01:54:03,450 --> 01:54:06,290
Some of those toppings are distasteful.

1741
01:54:06,470 --> 01:54:07,170
Don't punch him.

1742
01:54:07,630 --> 01:54:10,290
Gee, I wasn't expecting that one.

1743
01:54:10,630 --> 01:54:11,490
Gee, don't punch him.

1744
01:54:11,770 --> 01:54:12,370
Oh, okay.

1745
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:16,790
More toppings!

1746
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:17,490
Okay.

1747
01:54:22,510 --> 01:54:23,230
Okay.

1748
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:27,630
Okay.

1749
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:28,630
Okay.

1750
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:28,650
Okay.

1751
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:29,950
That topping, no.

1752
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:31,490
Okay.

1753
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:31,850
That topping?

1754
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:50,790
that's not good don't punch him okay they're so mean okay
this this is his combo right this is his combo it has to be

1755
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:52,030
he said more toppings

1756
01:54:56,990 --> 01:55:03,410
please Don't get it!

1757
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:04,110
What do you mean?

1758
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:05,010
I don't like it!

1759
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:05,590
No.

1760
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:08,350
Something's wrong.

1761
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:09,590
You wanted more.

1762
01:55:10,930 --> 01:55:12,350
He hates the cheese.

1763
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:13,430
Uh-oh.

1764
01:55:13,630 --> 01:55:14,390
I think we're...

1765
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:14,570
Oh!

1766
01:55:20,290 --> 01:55:22,170
Wait, can the dessert be...

1767
01:55:22,170 --> 01:55:23,950
Oh, it can be combined too!

1768
01:55:26,410 --> 01:55:29,330
Okay, so I think he likes the pizza as is.

1769
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:34,970
Maybe he wants this.

1770
01:55:36,190 --> 01:55:38,970
Because this is bad, right?

1771
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:46,750
Something must go.

1772
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:47,410
What?

1773
01:55:48,230 --> 01:55:48,970
That topping?

1774
01:55:49,550 --> 01:55:50,190
Not for me, thanks.

1775
01:55:51,850 --> 01:55:53,050
Something's wrong.

1776
01:55:53,410 --> 01:55:53,670
Bunk.

1777
01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:55,670
Oh my god, he's gonna get punched.

1778
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:56,490
Bunk.

1779
01:55:56,830 --> 01:55:58,020
It's kind of funny to watch him.

1780
01:56:09,330 --> 01:56:11,030
Oh, it's so good.

1781
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:16,460
Is this it?

1782
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:39,550
okay we got one this guy is so ridiculous yay oh my gosh
okay so we know she doesn't like a pizza she doesn't like

1783
01:56:39,550 --> 01:56:50,350
the pineapple this thing is gonna be so full by the end oh
my gosh it's tricky with so many different types of toppings

1784
01:56:50,350 --> 01:57:02,610
why they weren't kidding when they said very very hard it is
so hard mm-hmm so let's see I don't remember which ones are

1785
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:18,230
my creation creations and which one are I don't know the
graveyard of lost pizzas I know hmm just plain and

1786
01:57:18,250 --> 01:57:25,550
everything I know right what do you like hmm

1787
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:45,960
just I'm just gonna try it because I don't know what her
opinion is on the peppers some of those toppings are

1788
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:53,860
distasteful it's still missing my favorites okay so he likes
the peppers

1789
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:02,020
Okay, okay.

1790
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:03,520
What didn't he like?

1791
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:05,640
Oh gosh, I was only paying attention to him.

1792
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:14,630
Maybe this.

1793
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:18,190
You like that?

1794
01:58:18,310 --> 01:58:20,470
There's something there I hate.

1795
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:21,730
This isn't about you!

1796
01:58:22,130 --> 01:58:25,210
Gee, I wasn't expecting that one.

1797
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:34,320
We're going through them pretty quickly now.

1798
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:39,120
My gosh.

1799
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:40,260
Okay, it is so...

1800
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:48,000
I can't remember what his opinion was on this one.

1801
01:58:52,310 --> 01:58:52,750
I don't know.

1802
01:58:52,770 --> 01:58:53,870
Do any of them like cheese?

1803
01:58:56,110 --> 01:58:56,990
Let's try this.

1804
01:58:58,970 --> 01:58:59,930
Do you like cheese, mister?

1805
01:59:00,330 --> 01:59:01,010
Do you like cheese?

1806
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:03,570
Ah!

1807
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:05,250
I don't care!

1808
01:59:06,490 --> 01:59:07,730
May I have more, please?

1809
01:59:07,870 --> 01:59:10,710
Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1810
01:59:12,310 --> 01:59:12,710
Okay.

1811
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,840
Thank God this is just practice.

1812
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:23,000
They're getting massacred.

1813
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:25,220
This is so sad.

1814
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,420
Do you want a little topping?

1815
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:30,260
You want that?

1816
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:32,160
This is making me want pizza.

1817
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,420
Something's wrong.

1818
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,180
Something's wrong.

1819
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:38,920
What the?

1820
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:40,940
Something's wrong.

1821
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:43,440
The way he says it kind of annoys me.

1822
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:48,060
What do you guys think?

1823
01:59:48,620 --> 01:59:49,240
What do you guys think?

1824
01:59:49,580 --> 01:59:52,180
What would you, what are you, what are you, what are your
ideas?

1825
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:54,720
Hmm.

1826
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:57,760
Sounds like he's mocking her.

1827
01:59:57,960 --> 01:59:58,760
I know, right?

1828
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:03,180
Something's wrong, sprinkles.

1829
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:07,280
Sprinkles.

1830
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:08,820
Sprinkles.

1831
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:11,620
I don't know.

1832
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:13,280
I think I just gave him that one, right?

1833
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:28,040
topping no uh-oh uh-oh someone says mushroom is missing does
he like mushroom let's just try it

1834
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:46,500
something's wrong for me oh nice oh my gosh you were so
right good job good job good job good job okay She hates

1835
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:47,140
everything!

1836
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:49,960
I honestly have no idea what she wants.

1837
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:53,440
Like, do you want just a plain pizza?

1838
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:56,240
I don't understand what she wants.

1839
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:02,980
An empty, give her a whole plane.

1840
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:04,660
Alright, this one's for you!

1841
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:07,660
So carefully crafted.

1842
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:08,700
Is that all I get?

1843
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:09,300
Yes!

1844
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:10,860
Because you don't like anything else!

1845
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:20,280
So she hates pineapple.

1846
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:21,860
She hates peppers.

1847
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:26,420
Maybe it's just cheese.

1848
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:28,520
Just cheese.

1849
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:29,980
Let's try just cheese.

1850
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,460
There's something there I hate.

1851
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:37,260
Oh my god, it's a pizza.

1852
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,340
It's just a pizza.

1853
02:01:43,890 --> 02:01:45,570
My god.

1854
02:01:45,810 --> 02:01:47,050
She hates cheese.

1855
02:01:47,390 --> 02:02:04,010
uh this is ridiculous i don't even know just this just give
her yeah is this all you want you want your no way

1856
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:20,200
what no way comrades would make their way back she just got
like a soup

1857
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:26,780
Oh my gosh, we made it through, though.

1858
02:02:27,940 --> 02:02:28,500
I...

1859
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:29,880
I...

1860
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:30,080
I...

1861
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:30,320
What?

1862
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:34,520
Psychopath behavior right there.

1863
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:36,600
Wow.

1864
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:40,720
Wow, that one was really tricky, though.

1865
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:41,520
It was fine.

1866
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,360
Let's try something else.

1867
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:44,140
Let's try another one.

1868
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:45,220
Let's try the frogs.

1869
02:02:49,350 --> 02:02:51,270
I do remember the fairy.

1870
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:55,270
I do remember, but I don't remember...

1871
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:56,490
What was that?

1872
02:02:56,510 --> 02:02:56,790
thing.

1873
02:02:57,570 --> 02:02:58,990
I... Ooh, what is that thing?

1874
02:02:59,950 --> 02:03:00,910
What are you doing?

1875
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:02,630
What is that thing?

1876
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:03,550
I don't... Oh!

1877
02:03:03,910 --> 02:03:04,070
Oh!

1878
02:03:04,330 --> 02:03:05,570
Oh, I think I need to hurry!

1879
02:03:05,810 --> 02:03:06,930
Wait, what is that thing?

1880
02:03:07,690 --> 02:03:08,810
What is that thing?

1881
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:09,770
Ah!

1882
02:03:10,430 --> 02:03:11,210
What's it doing?

1883
02:03:18,030 --> 02:03:18,750
Oh no!

1884
02:03:19,570 --> 02:03:22,990
I think it found the path and now it's taken over it.

1885
02:03:28,750 --> 02:03:29,290
leave.

1886
02:03:30,350 --> 02:03:32,190
I don't know what the magic wand does.

1887
02:03:33,910 --> 02:03:36,250
The pink, unfortunately, does not work.

1888
02:03:37,890 --> 02:03:39,810
Blue does not work.

1889
02:03:41,210 --> 02:03:44,870
Red does not work.

1890
02:03:46,430 --> 02:03:49,130
Yellow does not work.

1891
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:51,170
These things are so annoying!

1892
02:03:53,110 --> 02:03:54,090
Try it out.

1893
02:03:57,470 --> 02:03:58,250
Oh, wait.

1894
02:03:58,370 --> 02:04:01,530
Maybe it will Well, um, what was one that was close?

1895
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:02,170
This one?

1896
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:06,600
Oh.

1897
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:09,660
Oh.

1898
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:17,940
Oh my god.

1899
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:19,060
Hurry.

1900
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:23,230
Oh, we're fine.

1901
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:24,590
Oh.

1902
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:25,890
Go.

1903
02:04:26,610 --> 02:04:26,910
Go.

1904
02:04:27,430 --> 02:04:27,570
Go.

1905
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:33,510
This game is so souls-like.

1906
02:04:35,430 --> 02:04:36,190
No.

1907
02:04:36,750 --> 02:04:37,770
Oh my gosh.

1908
02:04:37,890 --> 02:04:38,590
No, please.

1909
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:41,290
Let's get over.

1910
02:04:41,870 --> 02:04:43,090
No, no, no.

1911
02:04:44,030 --> 02:04:44,610
Oh, no.

1912
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:45,990
No.

1913
02:04:46,430 --> 02:04:49,250
Oh, he's following us.

1914
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:50,710
Ew, he's creepy, creepy, creepy, creepy.

1915
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:55,670
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

1916
02:04:55,910 --> 02:04:57,810
Oh, wait, what's gonna happen with them?

1917
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:00,870
No!

1918
02:05:03,820 --> 02:05:04,740
Okay, no.

1919
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:06,460
Oh, oh, oh my gosh.

1920
02:05:10,630 --> 02:05:11,550
It worked!

1921
02:05:13,310 --> 02:05:24,690
it ended up working out we got so lucky wait so with the
magic wand can I like like say if I want to move this one

1922
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:33,850
and this one oh I can interesting there's a little I think I
see like the magic running out

1923
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:42,110
why is that zoom Bean, they look weird.

1924
02:05:43,690 --> 02:05:44,930
I guess they all kind of look weird.

1925
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:46,350
Uh-oh.

1926
02:05:46,510 --> 02:05:47,950
Oh, oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1927
02:05:47,950 --> 02:05:48,570
Nice, nice, nice.

1928
02:05:50,810 --> 02:05:52,470
Why does he Fortnite dance?

1929
02:05:53,390 --> 02:05:54,950
Because he's excited.

1930
02:05:56,450 --> 02:05:57,950
Let him do his thing.

1931
02:05:59,570 --> 02:06:00,450
Don't judge.

1932
02:06:00,910 --> 02:06:01,970
Don't judge.

1933
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:09,480
Oh, I can also make the yellows work.

1934
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:11,620
Okay.

1935
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:16,640
Bing, bing, bing, bing.

1936
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:18,880
Yeah, though.

1937
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:23,600
What exactly is the puzzle here?

1938
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:24,120
Okay.

1939
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:30,600
So there's multiple types of paths that you can do depending
on what the frog is, right?

1940
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:36,220
So the first one is by color.

1941
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:40,880
The second is by the shape of the lily pad.

1942
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:42,320
See, four, four.

1943
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:46,120
Moon, moon, moon, moon.

1944
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:49,820
I gotta give moon.

1945
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,020
Moon, moon.

1946
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:58,280
And the third is the type of the flower that's on the lily
pad.

1947
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:02,300
Moon, moon.

1948
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:06,100
There's just so much info on the screen right now.

1949
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:09,180
I think that's why I like this one so much.

1950
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:12,720
There's so much that you can like look at.

1951
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:14,420
I hate these things.

1952
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:15,540
I've never seen these before.

1953
02:07:16,660 --> 02:07:21,150
Clearly, I suck at the game as a child because I never got
this far.

1954
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:24,180
Uh-oh.

1955
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:25,250
Uh-oh.

1956
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:28,740
No, no.

1957
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:31,700
No.

1958
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:33,060
No.

1959
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:34,600
Oh, no.

1960
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:36,400
Oh, no.

1961
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:37,340
Oh, no.

1962
02:07:37,820 --> 02:07:38,440
Oh, no.

1963
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:40,720
Oh, no, no, no.

1964
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:42,000
Oh, no.

1965
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:45,120
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1966
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:46,780
Oh, no, oh, no.

1967
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,340
A traffic jam!

1968
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:52,480
These ones, these guys are blocked up too!

1969
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:57,720
They're blocking the blue path that I just made!

1970
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:01,740
Uh-oh.

1971
02:08:01,940 --> 02:08:02,340
Guys.

1972
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:05,440
Guys.

1973
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:18,080
Do I even have enough magic to finish the path for them?

1974
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:20,540
They get clogged here.

1975
02:08:26,260 --> 02:08:28,240
Oh, it stops it.

1976
02:08:31,260 --> 02:08:33,880
Let's just do...

1977
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:35,560
This one.

1978
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:37,960
Goodbye!

1979
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:40,340
Sayonara!

1980
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:43,220
There you go.

1981
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:44,000
There they go.

1982
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:45,860
Yeah, yeah.

1983
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:46,180
Yeah, yeah.

1984
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:47,760
There we go.

1985
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:49,000
There we go.

1986
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:49,340
Wait.

1987
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:50,500
Why are you going back?

1988
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:51,360
Okay.

1989
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:51,800
Yeah?

1990
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:52,700
Move.

1991
02:08:53,140 --> 02:08:53,740
Oh my god.

1992
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:55,520
You're supposed to go forward.

1993
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:57,660
You're supposed to go forward.

1994
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:03,340
Oh my god.

1995
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:04,580
Oh no.

1996
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:06,160
He's too slow.

1997
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:08,320
No!

1998
02:09:08,700 --> 02:09:09,880
Oh no no no no no!

1999
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:10,900
Oh my gosh.

2000
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:11,580
You.

2001
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:12,080
You.

2002
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:14,900
They're all coming back.

2003
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:24,900

02:09:48,990 --> 02:09:49,810
Oh, hot frog.

2007
02:09:50,350 --> 02:09:51,310
We made it.

2008
02:09:51,310 --> 02:09:51,690
We made it.

2009
02:09:51,730 --> 02:09:52,050
Oh my gosh.

2010
02:09:52,190 --> 02:09:52,530
We made it.

2011
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:53,290
We made it.

2012
02:09:53,290 --> 02:09:53,790
We made it.

2013
02:09:53,870 --> 02:09:54,850
We made it.

2014
02:09:55,930 --> 02:09:56,230
We made it.

2015
02:09:56,230 --> 02:09:58,050
Oh, sweet.

2016
02:09:58,770 --> 02:09:59,270
Release.

2017
02:10:00,310 --> 02:10:02,890
Oh, my gosh.

2018
02:10:06,070 --> 02:10:06,590
Ooh.

2019
02:10:10,610 --> 02:10:11,630
Hip, hip.

2020
02:10:12,010 --> 02:10:12,630
Zoom-hity.

2021
02:10:15,710 --> 02:10:17,190
I don't even...

2022
02:10:17,230 --> 02:10:18,790
What other path can I take?

2023
02:10:20,670 --> 02:10:23,090
Which seat can I take?

2024
02:10:23,810 --> 02:10:27,410
I think I screwed everything up by using the magic wand too
much.

2025
02:10:28,350 --> 02:10:30,310
I played God and I'm...

2026
02:10:30,310 --> 02:10:32,410
I played God and I...

2027
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:33,710
I'm regretting it.

2028
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:37,310
I shouldn't have done it.

2029
02:10:38,590 --> 02:10:39,670
Oh my gosh.

2030
02:10:40,270 --> 02:10:40,850
Aqua blue?

2031
02:10:41,230 --> 02:10:41,750
Oh, you're right.

2032
02:10:47,230 --> 02:10:49,230
Did I make that one or...

2033
02:10:53,470 --> 02:10:55,350
Being God is suffering.

2034
02:10:59,530 --> 02:11:01,710
I wonder how many crabs are here.

2035
02:11:03,470 --> 02:11:07,210
I wonder how many crabs we can accumulate before we crash
the game.

2036
02:11:09,510 --> 02:11:11,230
Do they just end up be spawning or...

2037
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:15,790
How many crabs can we grab?

2038
02:11:24,270 --> 02:11:29,370
I want to take that path, but I can't.

2039
02:11:29,450 --> 02:11:30,910
Oh my gosh, they just keep coming.

2040
02:11:33,270 --> 02:11:36,510
You can tell there's new ones because they're...

2041
02:11:36,510 --> 02:11:37,650
These guys just giving up.

2042
02:11:37,710 --> 02:11:38,530
They don't even move.

2043
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:39,990
They don't care anymore.

2044
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:47,200
There's only one way to know.

2045
02:11:50,840 --> 02:12:08,080

02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:11,120
Yeah.

2052
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:13,300
You know.

2053
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:17,400
Wait, what is that guy doing?

2054
02:13:18,860 --> 02:13:19,660
What are you doing?

2055
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:23,880
Oh my gosh, I think they've...

2056
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:25,500
I think they've...

2057
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:26,220
Oh, nope, never mind.

2058
02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:26,940
They're still coming.

2059
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:31,100
Hmm.

2060
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:34,140
Mod Zumbini's into Wisps?

2061
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:35,580
Oh my gosh, that'd be crazy.

2062
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:36,980
What one was it?

2063
02:13:37,060 --> 02:13:37,420
The flower?

2064
02:13:40,700 --> 02:13:41,440
There we go.

2065
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:41,860
Oh no.

2066
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:43,720
Wait, there might be a clash.

2067
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:45,240
Oh, okay.

2068
02:13:45,560 --> 02:13:46,080
It's fine.

2069
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:47,600
He'll make it back.

2070
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:53,920
I think...

2071
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:56,440
I don't think I like this mini-game anymore.

2072
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:01,580
Okay, let's go to another one.

2073
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:03,160
Because this one...

2074
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:05,800
The crabs are too much for me.

2075
02:14:07,300 --> 02:14:09,240
No, no, don't do it.

2076
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:10,380
Yeah, that's what I thought.

2077
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:11,480
Back up.

2078
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:12,860
Back off.

2079
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:14,580
Oh.

2080
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:16,220
Silence.

2081
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:17,500
Finally.

2082
02:14:18,380 --> 02:14:20,020
No more brain-scritching sounds.

2083
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:25,600
I'm just so curious what some of these other, like, puzzles
would be, like, super hard.

2084
02:14:25,780 --> 02:14:26,400
You know what I mean?

2085
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:28,260
Like, what's this one?

2086
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:32,100
Well,

2087
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:36,320
what do we have here?

2088
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:39,960
Okay, so, wait, so...

2089
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:41,320
Go ahead and sit wherever you want to.

2090
02:14:41,380 --> 02:14:42,560
I don't really care.

2091
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:46,480
So, like, they would have to have something...

2092
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:48,780
Ah, and then they would...

2093
02:14:50,060 --> 02:14:52,620
Ah, oh my...

2094
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:54,160
I don't think it's cross.

2095
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:55,680
I don't think it's cross, luckily.

2096
02:14:57,640 --> 02:14:58,340
But, like, that...

2097
02:14:58,340 --> 02:14:58,580
Oh, wait.

2098
02:14:58,820 --> 02:14:59,880
No, she doesn't have a red...

2099
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:01,160
Oh, my gosh.

2100
02:15:01,740 --> 02:15:02,900
Wait, this one works, though.

2101
02:15:03,420 --> 02:15:04,280
This one works.

2102
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:07,380
Does this one...

2103
02:15:07,380 --> 02:15:08,560
Does this one go for the...

2104
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:09,900
Wait, hmm?

2105
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,280
I guess just this.

2106
02:15:18,620 --> 02:15:20,140
Ah, sure.

2107
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:22,040
I'm going by nose color currently.

2108
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:24,040
I wasn't in the beginning, but now I am.

2109
02:15:25,940 --> 02:15:27,520
Nose, nose.

2110
02:15:33,860 --> 02:15:34,300
Nose.

2111
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,440
That's our only pink.

2112
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:40,320
There you go, you got it.

2113
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:41,600
There you go, you got it.

2114
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:42,740
What nose?

2115
02:15:42,820 --> 02:15:43,480
What are you talking about?

2116
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:44,640
They all have noses.

2117
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:48,800
Don't give me your sass.

2118
02:15:50,420 --> 02:15:52,340
Don't give me your sass.

2119
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:54,400
No!

2120
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:59,260
You're so cute all soaking wet.

2121
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:00,160
Oh, okay.

2122
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:01,620
I was gonna say, is he gone?

2123
02:16:04,460 --> 02:16:07,880
Hey, Mint out of curiosity, did you ever play a game called
Virtual Villagers?

2124
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:11,420
I remember playing this game and Virtual Villagers a lot as
a kid.

2125
02:16:11,740 --> 02:16:13,420
I've never played Virtual Villagers.

2126
02:16:13,580 --> 02:16:13,900
No.

2127
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:16,080
I had not played Virtual Villagers.

2128
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:17,040
Played that.

2129
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:18,180
Sure.

2130
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:22,180
I think I screwed up with her.

2131
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:30,060
See, but this one won't work.

2132
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:31,520
Crabs alive.

2133
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:32,880
Crabs alive.

2134
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:34,320
What does that mean?

2135
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:37,000
Crabs alive.

2136
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:39,600
Oh my gosh, this one's hard.

2137
02:16:43,700 --> 02:16:43,900
This one.

2138
02:16:49,250 --> 02:16:50,490
Crabs alive.

2139
02:17:00,370 --> 02:17:01,730
This one's hard.

2140
02:17:05,350 --> 02:17:07,790
Don't like how the fish looks?

2141
02:17:08,830 --> 02:17:10,270
I just noticed them!

2142
02:17:10,630 --> 02:17:10,910
Ew!

2143
02:17:17,170 --> 02:17:17,450
Hmm.

2144
02:17:18,810 --> 02:17:19,210
Hmm.

2145
02:17:22,130 --> 02:17:22,370
Hmm.

2146
02:17:30,330 --> 02:17:30,790
Minecraft villager.

2147
02:17:31,430 --> 02:17:33,010
detal- Crave die!

2148
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:35,810
Hmm.

2149
02:17:37,710 --> 02:17:37,970
Hmm.

2150
02:17:39,110 --> 02:17:39,610
Hmm.

2151
02:17:41,390 --> 02:17:41,650
Hmm.

2152
02:17:44,830 --> 02:17:50,690
Trying to figure out, like, what would be the easiest, like,
thing to focus on, you know?

2153
02:17:51,810 --> 02:17:54,490
Okay, redo, redo, redo, redo, redo.

2154
02:17:54,810 --> 02:17:56,070
Redo, redo, redo.

2155
02:17:57,730 --> 02:17:58,710
He's floating.

2156
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:04,380
These poor guys don't even have names.

2157
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:05,180
That's so sad.

2158
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:07,940
Practice Zumbini one.

2159
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:09,700
Okay, practice Zumbini.

2160
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:12,120
and sit wherever you want to.

2161
02:18:12,180 --> 02:18:13,420
I don't really care.

2162
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:15,420
Starting from the center.

2163
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:20,220
So if I'm like, okay, let's just place these guys kind of
randomly.

2164
02:18:20,580 --> 02:18:23,400
Oh, oh, she works, but you.

2165
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:24,960
Ah, sure.

2166
02:18:25,560 --> 02:18:28,180
And you are four.

2167
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,280
And they each have different eyes.

2168
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:31,780
Wait, this kind of works.

2169
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:32,940
This kind of works, maybe.

2170
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:34,200
Maybe.

2171
02:18:39,090 --> 02:18:39,490
Okay.

2172
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:47,500
Is this...

2173
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:49,020
Ah, no.

2174
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:52,520
Wait, wait, no, which one does this go with?

2175
02:18:55,980 --> 02:18:56,120
How?

2176
02:18:56,660 --> 02:19:00,440
Oh, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see.

2177
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:01,500
I see, I see, I see.

2178
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:03,120
Ah, sure.

2179
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:06,860
Um, hmm.

2180
02:19:11,660 --> 02:19:14,800
The nose color always throws me off because it's like the
last thing I look at.

2181
02:19:17,740 --> 02:19:31,140
Um, red nose, Rudolph, the red nose, near you have nothing
in common hmm

2182
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:40,260
oh no no oh

2183
02:19:55,930 --> 02:20:10,470
my gosh it's delay thank you praise the sun oh these
animations are nuts i know the one thing that like really

2184
02:20:10,470 --> 02:20:18,150
like it's so impressive to me and looking at like stuff like
Freddy fish is just how much the like the game is like all

2185
02:20:18,150 --> 02:20:29,110
animated I'm going to be out here hey calm down mister I'm
I'm thinking okay my brain runs a little more slowly I

2186
02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:36,190
wonder instead in the center maybe I should do the nose
colors because I feel like that might be the where'd he go

2187
02:20:36,190 --> 02:20:42,310
oh like if it's There you go, you got it.

2188
02:20:44,370 --> 02:20:45,190
I like red.

2189
02:20:46,790 --> 02:20:48,250
No, but they don't have nothing in common.

2190
02:20:49,150 --> 02:20:49,290
Ah!

2191
02:20:51,130 --> 02:20:52,890
They have nothing in common.

2192
02:20:54,130 --> 02:20:54,230
Oh.

2193
02:20:55,210 --> 02:20:55,390
Oh.

2194
02:20:56,050 --> 02:20:57,170
I was like, oh no.

2195
02:20:57,690 --> 02:20:59,390
I think I just sacrificed her.

2196
02:21:00,430 --> 02:21:00,510
You.

2197
02:21:01,790 --> 02:21:03,290
Ah, sure.

2198
02:21:03,590 --> 02:21:04,770
To the crabs you go.

2199
02:21:05,150 --> 02:21:05,850
Crab's alive.

2200
02:21:06,790 --> 02:21:09,450
The crabs are alive with the taste of blood.

2201
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:20,580
I never understood what this wanted us to do.

2202
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:25,660
You have to, so the person next to them has to have one
matching feature.

2203
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:26,940
Sorry, Zumbini.

2204
02:21:27,460 --> 02:21:29,400
Next to them has to have one matching feature.

2205
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:38,920
So in this case, it would be like either the hair or the
nose color or the feet or the eyes.

2206
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:40,880
Well, that's the only things that can match.

2207
02:21:41,140 --> 02:21:41,880
All aboard.

2208
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:43,400
I'm getting bored.

2209
02:21:43,860 --> 02:21:59,520
up what wait no I'm so confused they have the same feet what
but they have the same

2210
02:22:07,450 --> 02:22:23,390
feet diagonal counts no wait wait okay hold on I'm gonna
test this it does go no diagonal does count.

2211
02:22:24,390 --> 02:22:25,850
That's so evil.

2212
02:22:29,090 --> 02:22:29,530
What?

2213
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:35,950
I think the board is effed.

2214
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:38,970
It's supposed to be a 4x4 board but it's all stacked.

2215
02:22:39,070 --> 02:22:40,650
That's what's confusing me about it.

2216
02:22:40,670 --> 02:22:45,670
So that's why I was just like, okay, I was counting them
because I was just like, okay, so even though it kind of

2217
02:22:45,670 --> 02:22:50,510
looks like it would go to this one, it goes to this one
because it's the third one.

2218
02:22:50,750 --> 02:22:53,650
But it's not It's very confusing.

2219
02:22:54,770 --> 02:22:55,750
Oh my gosh.

2220
02:22:55,870 --> 02:22:58,370
Wait, so because like this one, does it go to all three?

2221
02:22:58,650 --> 02:22:59,210
It must.

2222
02:22:59,810 --> 02:23:00,990
And then this one goes to two.

2223
02:23:01,550 --> 02:23:03,210
This one goes to three or two?

2224
02:23:03,670 --> 02:23:04,590
I can't tell.

2225
02:23:07,130 --> 02:23:08,590
It's like a hex board.

2226
02:23:09,430 --> 02:23:10,110
A hex board.

2227
02:23:10,350 --> 02:23:12,390
Yeah, this is very, very hard.

2228
02:23:13,410 --> 02:23:13,890
Wow.

2229
02:23:14,710 --> 02:23:19,270
Wait, so if it's just hard, is it like a regular grid?

2230
02:23:20,190 --> 02:23:21,850
It's very, very hard.

2231
02:23:23,130 --> 02:23:24,390
This is for children?

2232
02:23:27,990 --> 02:23:28,490
This is for...

2233
02:23:28,490 --> 02:23:29,250
There you go, you got it.

2234
02:23:29,450 --> 02:23:30,270
This is for babies?

2235
02:23:33,050 --> 02:23:34,190
Are you sure?

2236
02:23:36,490 --> 02:23:37,410
Are you sure?

2237
02:23:39,590 --> 02:23:40,550
Are you sure?

2238
02:23:41,910 --> 02:23:43,050
Oh my gosh.

2239
02:23:45,150 --> 02:23:46,110
Green nose.

2240
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:49,570
Oh, oh, he didn't match with this guy.

2241
02:23:49,710 --> 02:23:50,310
Oh my god.

2242
02:23:53,330 --> 02:23:56,290
Oh my gosh.

2243
02:23:57,650 --> 02:23:58,990
Oh no, this feels impossible.

2244
02:23:59,670 --> 02:24:01,530
Is there actually...

2245
02:24:01,530 --> 02:24:03,850
There's only one way you could do this.

2246
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:15,540
Might have to abandon some guys.

2247
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:16,400
Hair?

2248
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:27,120
Alternative title, only for baby geniuses.

2249
02:24:30,260 --> 02:24:34,180
So they must have at least one matching feature with
adjacent ones.

2250
02:24:34,540 --> 02:24:34,660
Yes.

2251
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:35,720
Yes, yes.

2252
02:24:35,740 --> 02:24:51,680
yes that's that's that's that's the thing only one per seat
oh sorry you got it sorry no oh no because i at least he

2253
02:24:51,680 --> 02:25:08,080
came back thank you thanks for your generosity ah sure so
like her and then what even would match here oh maybe like a

2254
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:24,400
cyclops no it's like i need a cyclops with a spring with
this hair it's so difficult this is too complicated next

2255
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:33,860
puzzle what about Well, this one I feel like would be
impossible, like actually.

2256
02:25:37,880 --> 02:25:37,980
Hmm?

2257
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:45,480
Wait, it's the exact same.

2258
02:25:46,580 --> 02:25:48,080
Hard crystal is fine, is it?

2259
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:51,300
That's the one where you get to mix and match the Zumbinis,
right?

2260
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:00,760
Mint realizes she can't do any very hard puzzle.

2261
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:01,700
Hey, hey, hey.

2262
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:04,620
I'm taste testing.

2263
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:12,180
I'm seeing why each one is very, very hard, okay?

2264
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:17,960
This one feels the exact same, though.

2265
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:21,880
Am I...

2266
02:26:21,880 --> 02:26:23,680
This one feels the exact same.

2267
02:26:24,320 --> 02:26:25,880
So we need a roller skater.

2268
02:26:26,380 --> 02:26:26,580
You.

2269
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:27,160
You.

2270
02:26:30,060 --> 02:26:30,940
Oh, wait.

2271
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:34,220
Oh, is that?

2272
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:36,200
I...

2273
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:36,400
Wait.

2274
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:41,420
The nose.

2275
02:26:43,780 --> 02:26:44,700
Wait, but the nose...

2276
02:26:44,700 --> 02:26:47,760
Does the nose correspond with the skates or the eyes?

2277
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:52,240
Does the nose color correspond...

2278
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:52,920
Oh, geez.

2279
02:26:53,220 --> 02:26:54,200
Okay, hold on this one.

2280
02:26:57,160 --> 02:26:57,760
Okay.

2281
02:27:02,460 --> 02:27:05,660
Okay, the hair is completely different.

2282
02:27:06,980 --> 02:27:08,300
It's all mixed up.

2283
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:11,080
It's all mixed up.

2284
02:27:11,480 --> 02:27:12,200
It's all...

2285
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:13,380
Everything is wrong.

2286
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:15,920
Everything is wrong!

2287
02:27:16,820 --> 02:27:19,660
Okay, so the eyes are the hair.

2288
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:25,860
So we need a scruffly hair with the booties.

2289
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:33,680
The booties are...

2290
02:27:35,660 --> 02:27:36,140
Green?

2291
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:47,470
I'm gonna guess this because I'm trying to get this guy it's
either this guy or this guy let's guess

2292
02:27:51,470 --> 02:28:07,790
this guy scruffed hair nose green yeah but both of them have
green noses let's do this one wait no this one yeah yeah

2293
02:28:09,350 --> 02:28:11,850
Okay, okay, okay.

2294
02:28:12,550 --> 02:28:19,770
So the first one, um, so its green nose corresponds to the
feet.

2295
02:28:23,230 --> 02:28:27,350
So we need a green nose and we need a yellow nose.

2296
02:28:34,030 --> 02:28:34,410
Right?

2297
02:28:35,670 --> 02:28:37,270
Green nose and yellow nose.

2298
02:28:39,330 --> 02:28:40,090
Mm-hmm.

2299
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:56,830
hmm so i'm gonna separate you go over you everybody else go
over here green nose yellow nose and not scruffly hair oh

2300
02:28:56,830 --> 02:29:13,530
wait yes wait i'm forgetting what corresponded to what part
uh oh wait the hair corresponded to the eyes So, no scruffly

2301
02:29:13,530 --> 02:29:14,110
hair.

2302
02:29:14,990 --> 02:29:17,210
We need dotted eyes.

2303
02:29:18,230 --> 02:29:19,350
We need you.

2304
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:28,840
Just kidding.

2305
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:31,100
Oh, dang it, I got the hair.

2306
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:32,000
Never mind.

2307
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:33,820
Wait, no scruffly hair is what I said.

2308
02:29:34,600 --> 02:29:34,800
Wait.

2309
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:36,380
Oh, it was this hair.

2310
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:36,980
Oh, my gosh.

2311
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:38,160
I'm so silly.

2312
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:39,860
I got it wrong.

2313
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:41,660
It's him, though.

2314
02:29:41,820 --> 02:29:42,220
It's him.

2315
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:44,600
What?

2316
02:29:45,020 --> 02:29:45,460
What?

2317
02:29:49,340 --> 02:29:51,540
We're gonna lose a few Zoombinis.

2318
02:30:00,550 --> 02:30:02,810
Is it not the...

2319
02:30:04,110 --> 02:30:04,790
Okay.

2320
02:30:12,980 --> 02:30:15,400
The green corresponds to the feet.

2321
02:30:16,740 --> 02:30:17,940
So it's her then?

2322
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:19,860
Because...

2323
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:23,500
Wait, what does the eyes correspond to then?

2324
02:30:23,860 --> 02:30:24,320
The hair.

2325
02:30:25,620 --> 02:30:26,620
The eyes correspond to the hair.

2326
02:30:27,700 --> 02:30:28,760
I can't keep track of this.

2327
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:30,100
I need this written down.

2328
02:30:30,460 --> 02:30:31,660
I can't keep track of it in my brain.

2329
02:30:31,820 --> 02:30:33,080
I'm a visual person.

2330
02:30:35,060 --> 02:30:38,900
Okay, goodbye, goodbye, scruffled, scruffled hair, yellow
nose.

2331
02:30:46,380 --> 02:30:46,940
Oh.

2332
02:30:48,520 --> 02:30:50,120
He just walks off.

2333
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:51,600
See ya.

2334
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:52,140
Okay.

2335
02:30:53,480 --> 02:30:55,820
Alrighty, alrighty, alrighty, already, already, already,
already.

2336
02:30:55,820 --> 02:31:11,040
already the feet correspond with the nose color so what we
have all yellow thank you and we need the eye color or the

2337
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:13,200
eye corresponds to the

2338
02:31:16,570 --> 02:31:28,950
to the hair it's her wait no hold on hold on hold on I'm so
confused.

2339
02:31:31,990 --> 02:31:35,630
Wait, I really need this written out for real.

2340
02:31:38,490 --> 02:31:39,970
I need this written out for real.

2341
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:47,620
What went to the...

2342
02:31:47,620 --> 02:31:49,760
Wait, what changes the hair again?

2343
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:54,040
What changes?

2344
02:31:54,220 --> 02:31:55,240
Yeah, take notes.

2345
02:31:55,580 --> 02:31:56,240
I need to.

2346
02:31:56,380 --> 02:31:57,480
My brain can't.

2347
02:31:58,780 --> 02:32:00,080
Oh my gosh.

2348
02:32:06,770 --> 02:32:10,790
Zumbini hair equals eyes.

2349
02:32:16,870 --> 02:32:18,250
So, okay, it's one of these guys.

2350
02:32:18,430 --> 02:32:19,050
Okay, it's not her.

2351
02:32:20,650 --> 02:32:21,690
It's one of these guys.

2352
02:32:23,750 --> 02:32:24,550
Feet.

2353
02:32:28,150 --> 02:32:29,810
Do we have any rollerblade guys?

2354
02:32:30,590 --> 02:32:31,570
We don't.

2355
02:32:33,470 --> 02:32:35,070
Feet become.

2356
02:32:37,190 --> 02:32:37,990
Feet.

2357
02:32:38,430 --> 02:32:38,910
No.

2358
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:48,000
Wait, so...

2359
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,260
Let's see.

2360
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:49,940
What did that?

2361
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:52,000
Feet change the nose color?

2362
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:53,240
Is that what it is?

2363
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:56,620
No.

2364
02:32:58,160 --> 02:32:59,720
Eyes change the nose color.

2365
02:33:01,480 --> 02:33:03,600
Eyes change the nose color.

2366
02:33:04,180 --> 02:33:05,380
It must be, right?

2367
02:33:05,980 --> 02:33:09,580
Because they have the same.

2368
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:11,180
But they...

2369
02:33:11,180 --> 02:33:11,400
Oh.

2370
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:26,200
also have the same nose but also i think and then and then
what else can we change oh the legs legs determine some i

2371
02:33:26,200 --> 02:33:38,210
really need this right now i think it's the left boy hold on
i need to figure out why though if i what else is wait what

2372
02:33:38,210 --> 02:33:42,770
does uh what changes there hold on i'm writing this in a

2373
02:33:46,170 --> 02:34:08,090
hair equals feet for the zoom beanies eyes equals nose color
zoomini eyes equals nose color then then

2374
02:34:11,380 --> 02:34:21,760
then what changes the So, it would be...

2375
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:23,460
What do all three...

2376
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:24,620
Do these three have in common?

2377
02:34:30,690 --> 02:34:33,910
What do they have in common to get this hair color?

2378
02:34:40,700 --> 02:34:42,000
The nose is the feet?

2379
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:44,440
Oh, you're right.

2380
02:34:44,860 --> 02:34:45,940
Oh, you're right, you're right, you're right.

2381
02:34:47,400 --> 02:34:47,800
Nose...

2382
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:48,540
Wait, huh?

2383
02:34:48,820 --> 02:34:49,460
It's not the hair?

2384
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:50,320
It goes with the... Wait.

2385
02:34:51,180 --> 02:34:51,420
No!

2386
02:34:51,660 --> 02:34:51,960
Oh!

2387
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:52,300
Oh!

2388
02:34:52,580 --> 02:34:52,780
Oh!

2389
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:53,320
Wait, wait, wait.

2390
02:34:53,500 --> 02:34:53,620
Oh!

2391
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:54,600
Nose...

2392
02:34:54,600 --> 02:34:55,200
Okay, sorry.

2393
02:34:58,020 --> 02:35:13,340
feet you're right yes Zumbini knows equals feet so what does
that leave I have oh I need Zumbini feet equals what do I

2394
02:35:13,340 --> 02:35:22,960
not have so the feet equals the hair but that doesn't make
any sense because these three have the same hair these guys

2395
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:24,400
have nothing in common.

2396
02:35:35,310 --> 02:35:36,670
Seems like feet don't mean anything.

2397
02:35:38,250 --> 02:35:38,690
Thank you!

2398
02:35:40,270 --> 02:35:45,270
You see him, you strike me as the kind of ghost who grew up
with brain quest.

2399
02:35:45,470 --> 02:35:46,110
Confirm deny.

2400
02:35:46,610 --> 02:35:50,930
I don't know what brain quest is, so I guess I must deny.

2401
02:35:54,030 --> 02:35:56,070
Fleen hair is currently unbound.

2402
02:35:56,890 --> 02:35:57,930
Oh my gosh, so it's random?

2403
02:36:01,220 --> 02:36:03,340
So it's either, it's one of these guys?

2404
02:36:07,770 --> 02:36:21,510
Oh no It's just one of them We don't know I don't feel like
No way there's no logic to it Right like But seriously like

2405
02:36:21,510 --> 02:36:28,850
how could This hair And these three guys You know like That
doesn't make any sense

2406
02:36:33,830 --> 02:36:42,870
Okay guys Let's make a poll Let's make a poll Which What
Which Zumbini?

2407
02:36:43,690 --> 02:36:45,910
Left, right.

2408
02:36:48,270 --> 02:36:49,090
Which Zumbini?

2409
02:36:49,930 --> 02:36:54,910
On the left, we have Roller Blade Madness.

2410
02:36:55,890 --> 02:36:58,210
He is insane.

2411
02:36:58,530 --> 02:37:01,090
He will do wheelies for hours.

2412
02:37:01,470 --> 02:37:08,730
He is always grinding every moment he gets Roller Blade
Madness.

2413
02:37:09,250 --> 02:37:11,210
On the left, I mean, sorry, on the right.

2414
02:37:11,230 --> 02:37:17,630

2415
02:37:21,940 --> 02:37:30,830

2417
02:37:52,830 --> 02:37:53,730
This is the present.

2418
02:37:54,910 --> 02:37:56,890
We are on very, very hard.

2419
02:37:57,310 --> 02:37:59,850
Where all logic has been thrown out the window.

2420
02:38:02,290 --> 02:38:03,710
It is different here.

2421
02:38:04,610 --> 02:38:06,370
Why should not be either of these two?

2422
02:38:06,590 --> 02:38:09,570
Alright, 59% said left, so let's go with left.

2423
02:38:14,730 --> 02:38:15,210
Hey!

2424
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:21,360
Okay, it's all the features!

2425
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:25,980
It's all the features, but the hair.

2426
02:38:27,860 --> 02:38:29,540
No way, it's actually random.

2427
02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:32,720
Because look, this one goes to...

2428
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:35,380
They have nothing in common!

2429
02:38:48,980 --> 02:38:49,900
Oh,

2430
02:38:57,790 --> 02:38:58,710
nice.

2431
02:39:09,670 --> 02:39:10,210
Sheesh!

2432
02:39:11,710 --> 02:39:12,730
That one was crazy.

2433
02:39:13,710 --> 02:39:14,890
Someone said the crystal one is...

2434
02:39:14,890 --> 02:39:16,530
Wait, did they say the crystal one was fun?

2435
02:39:16,810 --> 02:39:18,330
Oh yeah, yeah, with the...

2436
02:39:21,550 --> 02:39:22,030
Oh!

2437
02:39:22,890 --> 02:39:23,410
Wait.

2438
02:39:26,790 --> 02:39:27,150
Bing.

2439
02:39:29,110 --> 02:39:30,460
So we have to make...

2440
02:39:31,710 --> 02:39:32,090
Huh?

2441
02:39:33,150 --> 02:39:33,690
Huh?

2442
02:39:34,650 --> 02:39:35,190
Huh?

2443
02:39:36,610 --> 02:39:37,170
Oh!

2444
02:39:39,270 --> 02:39:39,590
Wait.

2445
02:39:41,590 --> 02:39:41,970
Huh?

2446
02:39:44,170 --> 02:39:44,530
Huh?

2447
02:39:46,450 --> 02:39:46,710
Huh?

2448
02:39:48,890 --> 02:39:49,450
Oh!

2449
02:39:50,610 --> 02:39:52,510
Do I have to wait for it to come back?

2450
02:39:55,010 --> 02:39:55,570
No!

2451
02:39:55,810 --> 02:39:56,650
That's not what I picked!

2452
02:39:57,650 --> 02:39:58,250
That's not what I picked!

2453
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:03,160
Huh?

2454
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:11,400
Huh?

2455
02:40:11,960 --> 02:40:12,360
Huh?

2456
02:40:19,170 --> 02:40:21,130
Can you put one on the left as well?

2457
02:40:21,870 --> 02:40:22,430
That's a good question.

2458
02:40:22,490 --> 02:40:23,110
Oh, you can!

2459
02:40:26,050 --> 02:40:26,830
You can.

2460
02:40:27,070 --> 02:40:30,130
But I'm so concerned about it looking like it's yellow.

2461
02:40:32,950 --> 02:40:33,170
Oh, wait.

2462
02:40:33,470 --> 02:40:34,610
Oh, this is a combo.

2463
02:40:35,550 --> 02:40:36,430
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2464
02:40:36,670 --> 02:40:37,310
Hold on.

2465
02:40:39,710 --> 02:40:42,690
I don't know if it matters, but...

2466
02:40:44,050 --> 02:40:45,230
Now it's saying it's pink?

2467
02:40:47,730 --> 02:40:48,130
Okay.

2468
02:40:49,250 --> 02:40:50,850
Why is it changing colors?

2469
02:40:51,810 --> 02:40:52,770
Why can't you just be yellow?

2470
02:40:53,690 --> 02:40:54,550
This is so confusing.

2471
02:40:57,850 --> 02:41:00,190
The nose changed colors when you move spaces.

2472
02:41:01,330 --> 02:41:04,310
Yeah, it was yellow on this side.

2473
02:41:05,590 --> 02:41:06,810
So I think I have to get the right...

2474
02:41:08,410 --> 02:41:08,850
Com...

2475
02:41:08,850 --> 02:41:11,050
Oh, see, see, see, this is the right combination.

2476
02:41:11,810 --> 02:41:12,690
But there's no other...

2477
02:41:13,350 --> 02:41:14,690
Unless, unless it's...

2478
02:41:17,010 --> 02:41:17,450
No.

2479
02:41:18,150 --> 02:41:18,470
No.

2480
02:41:19,130 --> 02:41:23,570
I gotta get the the wombo combo no?

2481
02:41:24,190 --> 02:41:24,570
Never mind?

2482
02:41:26,850 --> 02:41:28,730
But there's no other way to change the nose color.

2483
02:41:30,530 --> 02:41:30,930
Hmm?

2484
02:41:32,210 --> 02:41:32,990
I had it?

2485
02:41:34,370 --> 02:41:35,170
Oh, it's yellow!

2486
02:41:36,150 --> 02:41:36,630
Sorry.

2487
02:41:37,210 --> 02:41:38,210
Yes, it's yellow.

2488
02:41:38,390 --> 02:41:39,510
You're right, you're right, you're right.

2489
02:41:40,510 --> 02:41:42,710
Sorry, for some reason I was thinking a different color.

2490
02:41:42,910 --> 02:41:43,530
Okay, you're still right.

2491
02:41:45,150 --> 02:42:01,570
So that should do it what the who are you what a

2492
02:42:16,190 --> 02:42:19,050
stranger appeared you guys

2493
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:36,500
i don't understand it at all i don't understand it at all
how am i supposed to do two hairs Saddles at once!

2494
02:42:48,540 --> 02:42:49,980
Try the question mark.

2495
02:42:51,340 --> 02:42:53,580
Things have changed as the path has become more difficult.

2496
02:42:53,800 --> 02:42:55,740
But the Zumbinis have faith in you, Brave Explorer.

2497
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:58,500
You have all the information you need to complete this
challenge.

2498
02:42:58,620 --> 02:42:59,700
You get all your Zumbinis through.

2499
02:43:00,060 --> 02:43:00,560
Take your time.

2500
02:43:00,660 --> 02:43:02,980
Look for patterns and don't be afraid to make a few
mistakes.

2501
02:43:03,220 --> 02:43:05,560
Making mistakes is a life or death narrator.

2502
02:43:06,280 --> 02:43:10,600
If a few of our little blue friends are left behind, they'll
be waiting at Shade Tree to try again.

2503
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:14,720
Use the crystal filters to change the Zumbinis reflection.

2504
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:18,980
of them crystal slamming protection.

2505
02:43:20,340 --> 02:43:23,880
Okay, that doesn't, that doesn't make you feel any better.

2506
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:30,940
These ones don't change.

2507
02:43:32,300 --> 02:43:37,040
There's, there's, I need a yellow, right?

2508
02:43:37,560 --> 02:43:38,300
For her.

2509
02:43:38,700 --> 02:43:40,340
What is going on?

2510
02:43:41,580 --> 02:43:43,920
What is happening?

2511
02:43:45,980 --> 02:43:48,140
How am I supposed to get this haircut?

2512
02:43:52,520 --> 02:43:55,380
It makes no sense.

2513
02:43:56,280 --> 02:43:57,940
No wonder I couldn't beat this.

2514
02:43:58,340 --> 02:43:59,620
It doesn't make any sense.

2515
02:44:00,580 --> 02:44:02,480
Am I... Am I... Am I

2516
02:44:05,860 --> 02:44:06,720
the...

2517
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:09,920
No, I need a degree for this game.

2518
02:44:12,980 --> 02:44:15,780
Glasses plus nose and spring on left.

2519
02:44:19,480 --> 02:44:20,380
But why?

2520
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:23,360
Also, does it matter?

2521
02:44:24,900 --> 02:44:26,100
Because it's red!

2522
02:44:27,700 --> 02:44:29,300
It's gonna make it red!

2523
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:39,560
Two!

2524
02:44:40,440 --> 02:44:41,160
Thank you!

2525
02:44:42,140 --> 02:44:42,500
What?

2526
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:44,220
I don't think I need the glasses.

2527
02:44:45,460 --> 02:44:46,300
Here, right?

2528
02:44:46,420 --> 02:44:47,520
I just need this?

2529
02:44:50,700 --> 02:44:51,020
Wait.

2530
02:44:55,100 --> 02:44:56,820
Oh, I see, I see, I see!

2531
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:57,960
Okay, okay, hold on.

2532
02:44:58,440 --> 02:45:01,120
So, I need them to both have this hairstyle.

2533
02:45:01,640 --> 02:45:04,140
first of all because they're both gonna match the hair.

2534
02:45:04,700 --> 02:45:04,700
Okay.

2535
02:45:05,440 --> 02:45:10,140
okay, okay we don't need the nose because and we need the
spring.

2536
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:17,400
So she is going to become like this.

2537
02:45:18,760 --> 02:45:21,920
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2538
02:45:22,600 --> 02:45:24,620
Oh, but we need the actually we do need the nose.

2539
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:25,200
Oh, shoot.

2540
02:45:25,860 --> 02:45:27,500
Wait, we do need the nose for her.

2541
02:45:29,300 --> 02:45:30,100
Can I do three?

2542
02:45:30,740 --> 02:45:31,420
Oh, I can.

2543
02:45:34,780 --> 02:45:35,300
Okay,

2544
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:40,120
okay, this should be it.

2545
02:45:40,340 --> 02:45:40,940
This should be it.

2546
02:45:41,700 --> 02:45:43,160
Does it need to be in order or?

2547
02:45:54,090 --> 02:45:54,610
Yeah!

2548
02:45:56,930 --> 02:45:58,570
It doesn't need to be in order, clearly.

2549
02:46:01,690 --> 02:46:02,310
We cooked!

2550
02:46:03,350 --> 02:46:03,870
Yeah!

2551
02:46:06,250 --> 02:46:07,270
That one was...

2552
02:46:07,270 --> 02:46:08,330
This is crazy.

2553
02:46:08,470 --> 02:46:09,350
I get it now, though.

2554
02:46:09,490 --> 02:46:09,850
I get it.

2555
02:46:09,950 --> 02:46:10,250
I get it.

2556
02:46:10,350 --> 02:46:10,670
I get it.

2557
02:46:11,050 --> 02:46:11,190
I get it.

2558
02:46:11,190 --> 02:46:11,970
So, okay.

2559
02:46:12,810 --> 02:46:13,210
Interesting.

2560
02:46:14,010 --> 02:46:14,410
Interesting.

2561
02:46:15,210 --> 02:46:15,210
Interesting.

2562
02:46:16,970 --> 02:46:17,830
God gamer.

2563
02:46:21,490 --> 02:46:22,430
This one's fine.

2564
02:46:22,570 --> 02:46:24,390
Okay, this one's actually pretty interesting.

2565
02:46:25,190 --> 02:46:25,190
Okay.

2566
02:46:27,330 --> 02:46:27,730
Okay.

2567
02:46:29,450 --> 02:46:31,190
Okay, well, I'll just have the same hair.

2568
02:46:31,730 --> 02:46:32,430
Sounds good to me.

2569
02:46:32,830 --> 02:46:33,590
Sounds good to me.

2570
02:46:35,650 --> 02:46:38,770
Now, just match these?

2571
02:46:39,910 --> 02:46:40,750
No.

2572
02:46:44,700 --> 02:46:45,540
Skates?

2573
02:46:55,030 --> 02:46:55,450
Hmm.

2574
02:46:57,190 --> 02:46:58,470
Big brain.

2575
02:47:11,640 --> 02:47:13,740
Probably matters the order of the mirrors.

2576
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:15,320
It didn't seem like it before.

2577
02:47:18,620 --> 02:47:20,420
So I'm not quite sure.

2578
02:47:23,280 --> 02:47:23,700
Hmm.

2579
02:47:27,020 --> 02:47:27,640
Hmm.

2580
02:47:30,140 --> 02:47:30,500
Hmm.

2581
02:47:34,940 --> 02:47:35,360
Boom.

2582
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,160
Wait, so I have a question.

2583
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:45,040
I wonder if it, like, starts.

2584
02:47:45,880 --> 02:47:46,060
Wait.

2585
02:47:46,620 --> 02:47:48,060
Does it cycle through these?

2586
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:49,940
Like, even when we're going through?

2587
02:47:50,840 --> 02:47:52,680
They wouldn't do that to us, right?

2588
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:53,620
Okay.

2589
02:47:56,220 --> 02:47:58,660
We do definitely have to change the eyes.

2590
02:47:59,620 --> 02:48:02,480
Like so, for example, I do this.

2591
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:06,400
No, that makes no sense.

2592
02:48:09,860 --> 02:48:11,480
Why are these ones flashing?

2593
02:48:11,660 --> 02:48:12,760
It makes me nervous.

2594
02:48:14,300 --> 02:48:16,460
Oh, because I can change it to something else.

2595
02:48:17,380 --> 02:48:17,700
Oh.

2596
02:48:21,170 --> 02:48:22,910
Front will replace the back.

2597
02:48:23,950 --> 02:48:24,410
It will.

2598
02:48:26,530 --> 02:48:28,410
Are we sure about that?

2599
02:48:30,310 --> 02:48:32,410
Wait, okay, so...

2600
02:48:35,230 --> 02:48:39,690
Hold on, I'm just gonna place some things on the side.

2601
02:48:41,310 --> 02:48:43,670
I'm just gonna place...

2602
02:48:47,710 --> 02:48:49,510
So if I have it...

2603
02:48:49,510 --> 02:48:50,130
Hair?

2604
02:48:56,550 --> 02:48:58,150
Wait, all we need for this one?

2605
02:48:58,230 --> 02:48:58,450
Okay.

2606
02:48:59,290 --> 02:49:00,990
If it's this...

2607
02:49:01,010 --> 02:49:12,950
first oh well this one's also never mind this one also is
gonna get the hair still need the eyes on the left yeah

2608
02:49:12,950 --> 02:49:14,530
you're right

2609
02:49:25,340 --> 02:49:38,820
boom this one turns into a plane this one oh oh oh oh ah uh
oh i think i'm breaking the game Is this the one I...

2610
02:49:38,820 --> 02:49:39,820
Wait, this one.

2611
02:49:40,120 --> 02:49:40,740
Take out.

2612
02:49:46,060 --> 02:49:49,020
My Oshi with the 998 IQ.

2613
02:49:50,980 --> 02:49:52,580
Think of it like Photoshop layers.

2614
02:49:55,680 --> 02:49:56,240
I think...

2615
02:49:56,240 --> 02:49:56,880
Ah, I...

2616
02:49:56,880 --> 02:49:58,000
Okay, I get it.

2617
02:49:58,040 --> 02:49:58,700
I get it.

2618
02:49:59,500 --> 02:49:59,900
I think.

2619
02:50:01,560 --> 02:50:02,120
I think.

2620
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:05,280
But we need the eyes.

2621
02:50:06,480 --> 02:50:06,900
Here.

2622
02:50:07,580 --> 02:50:08,000
Okay.

2623
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:10,160
but

2624
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:26,540
well we only need okay essentially what I'm like struggling
with is this

2625
02:50:29,740 --> 02:50:40,140
one is this guy and this guy they have mostly matching
features we need the nose though ah ah ah ah

2626
02:50:46,340 --> 02:50:53,340
layer closest to the middle is the top layer yeah but i
think what i'm confused about is how it will work the second

2627
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:55,780
round you know what i mean like

2628
02:50:59,590 --> 02:51:13,630
so the the spark will have so the first so i need this wait
will this last all ah ah ah

2629
02:51:18,360 --> 02:51:21,420
Yeah, the blocks won't change only the turntable and the
zombie needs.

2630
02:51:22,220 --> 02:51:23,460
So I need them to...

2631
02:51:23,460 --> 02:51:26,420
It feels like I need them to match on both sides.

2632
02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:28,560
Like, or have the same exact things.

2633
02:51:28,720 --> 02:51:30,320
But when I put the plates...

2634
02:51:30,320 --> 02:51:32,260
When I put these crystals down, they don't.

2635
02:51:35,100 --> 02:51:35,520
See?

2636
02:51:36,420 --> 02:51:38,480
We get a little propeller, man.

2637
02:51:39,280 --> 02:51:40,180
We get the...

2638
02:51:40,180 --> 02:51:41,700
Don't worry about the flashing.

2639
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:46,720
Are you sure?

2640
02:51:57,440 --> 02:51:57,880
Okay.

2641
02:51:59,780 --> 02:52:00,220
Oh!

2642
02:52:01,580 --> 02:52:03,340
Okay, wait, I think I get it.

2643
02:52:03,800 --> 02:52:08,920
Okay, so because this is in front, it won't recognize the
wheel.

2644
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:09,740
Right?

2645
02:52:09,960 --> 02:52:10,580
Is that what you...

2646
02:52:10,580 --> 02:52:17,980
Okay, so it'll be like, okay, the hair is on, the nose, and
this is on, and then the The eyes are on.

2647
02:52:18,600 --> 02:52:18,660
Ow!

2648
02:52:20,700 --> 02:52:27,400
So then, oh, oh, you guys, the game is breaking.

2649
02:52:28,500 --> 02:52:30,240
Oh no, he's stuck.

2650
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:32,660
Oh, okay, we're good, we're good.

2651
02:52:34,060 --> 02:52:34,380
Okay.

2652
02:52:35,980 --> 02:52:36,620
No!

2653
02:52:38,280 --> 02:52:38,820
Uh-oh.

2654
02:52:39,320 --> 02:52:40,640
You guys, I think I broke the game.

2655
02:52:45,410 --> 02:52:48,030
I think I broke the game.

2656
02:52:53,180 --> 02:52:54,940
Oh, no.

2657
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:02,500
Oh, we were so close right when I got it.

2658
02:53:03,620 --> 02:53:05,500
Right when I understood.

2659
02:53:06,820 --> 02:53:08,540
We, I'm, no.

2660
02:53:10,140 --> 02:53:12,460
Right when I understood.

2661
02:53:15,220 --> 02:53:15,940
Oh.

2662
02:53:17,700 --> 02:53:19,240
Okay, I'm going to try anyway.

2663
02:53:27,210 --> 02:53:28,250
It made a noise.

2664
02:53:33,650 --> 02:53:35,610
Who is that?

2665
02:53:36,930 --> 02:53:37,530
Wait, what?

2666
02:53:37,670 --> 02:53:38,730
Why is...

2667
02:53:38,730 --> 02:53:41,530
It changed the hair to the girl's hair!

2668
02:53:42,350 --> 02:53:42,590
Why?

2669
02:53:43,970 --> 02:53:44,650
What?

2670
02:53:48,790 --> 02:53:50,930
I think the game broke a little.

2671
02:53:51,350 --> 02:53:52,870
It was this hair before!

2672
02:53:55,630 --> 02:53:56,310
Okay.

2673
02:53:56,910 --> 02:53:58,930
Okay, let's redo, redo, redo, redo.

2674
02:53:59,590 --> 02:54:01,270
Redo, redo, redo, redo.

2675
02:54:10,270 --> 02:54:10,910
Okay.

2676
02:54:20,780 --> 02:54:23,280
No, the nose is fine.

2677
02:54:25,920 --> 02:54:26,340
Um.

2678
02:54:33,540 --> 02:54:35,060
Well, just to...

2679
02:54:35,060 --> 02:54:36,300
Does it matter if I...

2680
02:54:36,300 --> 02:54:37,740
What legs I do?

2681
02:54:38,740 --> 02:54:39,380
I guess.

2682
02:54:39,700 --> 02:54:41,700
I guess it wants me to do these.

2683
02:54:42,480 --> 02:54:43,120
Okay.

2684
02:54:43,140 --> 02:54:45,380
Because it gave me two of them.

2685
02:54:48,460 --> 02:54:49,600
Does this look correct?

2686
02:54:52,540 --> 02:54:54,440
It gives us the eyes.

2687
02:54:56,080 --> 02:54:56,720
The...

2688
02:54:56,720 --> 02:54:57,040
Two!

2689
02:54:57,520 --> 02:54:58,220
Thank you.

2690
02:54:59,800 --> 02:55:00,940
That looks correct.

2691
02:55:01,640 --> 02:55:01,960
Oh!

2692
02:55:05,360 --> 02:55:06,000
Yippee!

2693
02:55:08,100 --> 02:55:10,260
Wait, why does it have a pink nose?

2694
02:55:11,240 --> 02:55:13,020
Where did the green nose go?

2695
02:55:13,140 --> 02:55:13,680
You know what?

2696
02:55:14,260 --> 02:55:14,720
It's fine.

2697
02:55:14,880 --> 02:55:15,640
They made it through.

2698
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:18,780
Okay.

2699
02:55:19,240 --> 02:55:19,500
Okay.

2700
02:55:19,820 --> 02:55:19,880
Okay.

2701
02:55:20,020 --> 02:55:20,180
Okay.

2702
02:55:21,340 --> 02:55:21,760
Okay.

2703
02:55:22,400 --> 02:55:22,400
Okay.

2704
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:22,900
Okay.

2705
02:55:22,900 --> 02:55:23,080
Okay.

2706
02:55:24,920 --> 02:55:25,380
Okay.

2707
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:26,640
Okay.

2708
02:55:27,280 --> 02:55:28,240
Let's see.

2709
02:55:36,420 --> 02:55:38,500
Let's see what the other hair is.

2710
02:55:41,420 --> 02:55:41,600
Okay.

2711
02:55:42,060 --> 02:55:42,160
Okay.

2712
02:55:45,940 --> 02:55:47,100
What's the glasses?

2713
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:47,780
on the side?

2714
02:55:51,620 --> 02:55:52,060
Sad.

2715
02:55:53,700 --> 02:55:54,420
What was it on the side?

2716
02:55:57,380 --> 02:55:57,820
Glasses.

2717
02:55:57,940 --> 02:55:59,120
Okay, we...

2718
02:56:02,720 --> 02:56:03,160
Sad.

2719
02:56:04,380 --> 02:56:06,700
How logical are these Zumbini's chat?

2720
02:56:06,980 --> 02:56:09,080
There is something going on here.

2721
02:56:09,820 --> 02:56:11,320
I'm not going to play for too much longer.

2722
02:56:12,120 --> 02:56:13,000
Actually, you know what?

2723
02:56:13,420 --> 02:56:22,740
Because I do want to see a few of the other things on the
super hard let's go back um sorry i meant very very hard

2724
02:56:22,740 --> 02:56:29,480
we're like at the hardest like the this one it's the exact
same

2725
02:56:33,860 --> 02:56:46,480
it's the exact same maybe it's like tinier traits that he
likes and dislikes okay never mind yes but trickier i think

2726
02:56:46,480 --> 02:56:48,260
these ones are gonna be the same.

2727
02:56:48,380 --> 02:56:50,180
This one I know has a lot more rooms.

2728
02:56:50,680 --> 02:56:51,320
What?

2729
02:56:52,140 --> 02:56:52,600
Hello?

2730
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:55,100
Guess what?

2731
02:56:55,380 --> 02:56:56,720
We're going on tour.

2732
02:56:57,120 --> 02:57:00,400
But thanks to you and your cousins, this place has grown.

2733
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:03,160
You are too much.

2734
02:57:03,760 --> 02:57:04,100
Mwah!

2735
02:57:05,060 --> 02:57:08,060
Can't drop down right now, but have fun.

2736
02:57:08,380 --> 02:57:09,860
It's better than having none.

2737
02:57:11,200 --> 02:57:13,700
I didn't expect this many rooms.

2738
02:57:15,160 --> 02:57:16,220
Oh my god!

2739
02:57:18,080 --> 02:57:20,640
I've never seen this many rooms before.

2740
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:25,380
What if I just stick you here?

2741
02:57:37,820 --> 02:57:39,800
But they all, they went into the...

2742
02:57:39,800 --> 02:57:41,840
This one is in half, though.

2743
02:57:52,530 --> 02:57:55,110
Why are there so many rooms?

2744
02:57:56,010 --> 02:57:56,390
What?

2745
02:57:59,400 --> 02:57:59,840
Huh?

2746
02:58:11,880 --> 02:58:12,780
Thank you!

2747
02:58:13,360 --> 02:58:14,000
Oh!

2748
02:58:14,100 --> 02:58:16,040
Did you see the first episode of the Blue Archive anime?

2749
02:58:16,220 --> 02:58:17,300
Yes, I watched it.

2750
02:58:17,360 --> 02:58:18,760
I actually watched it earlier.

2751
02:58:19,180 --> 02:58:20,300
I watched it before stream.

2752
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:21,480
Oh my gosh.

2753
02:58:23,400 --> 02:58:24,360
They're so cute.

2754
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:28,060
The opening is so cute.

2755
02:58:29,760 --> 02:58:30,760
It's 5x5x5.

2756
02:58:31,340 --> 02:58:32,100
Yeah, but...

2757
02:58:33,580 --> 02:58:35,340
Wait, is it already starting to get darker?

2758
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:38,040
Is the time limit so much...

2759
02:58:38,040 --> 02:58:44,000
Like, it's so funny because you could see where it's like
the line of...

2760
02:58:44,100 --> 02:58:55,220
darkness but they also not showing you the clock but yeah
the blue archive anime is so cute that opening is so cute oh

2761
02:58:55,220 --> 02:59:15,860
they're so cute that's super duper cute i'm just gonna put
at random this is so this is so bizarre oh i did it is it

2762
02:59:15,860 --> 02:59:23,740
it's not by nose color unless it's by nose color and
something else but i'm locking up soon better get indoors

2763
02:59:23,740 --> 02:59:33,260
already ma'am i haven't even ula the forest foremost and
perhaps only band leader is about to begin rehearsals she'll

2764
02:59:33,260 --> 02:59:37,780
be closing the hotel for the night so scamper into a room
things have changed as the path has become more difficult

2765
02:59:37,780 --> 02:59:42,780
but the zoom meetings have faith in you brave explorer you
have all the information you need to complete this challenge

2766
02:59:42,780 --> 02:59:45,000
and kick your zoom meetings through I do?

2767
02:59:45,720 --> 02:59:46,180
I do?

2768
02:59:47,440 --> 02:59:49,220
I have all the information?

2769
02:59:50,280 --> 02:59:50,980
Do I actually?

2770
02:59:53,680 --> 02:59:54,280
Ow!

2771
02:59:54,780 --> 02:59:55,220
Ow!

2772
02:59:57,320 --> 02:59:58,240
What about, like, you?

2773
02:59:59,480 --> 02:59:59,780
Ow!

2774
03:00:07,130 --> 03:00:07,390
Okay.

2775
03:00:08,010 --> 03:00:08,590
Next one.

2776
03:00:08,890 --> 03:00:09,190
Let's see.

2777
03:00:09,270 --> 03:00:10,850
Oh, this one probably would be...

2778
03:00:15,910 --> 03:00:17,190
Wait, what is this?

2779
03:00:17,770 --> 03:00:21,130
Oh, the color of the star, too?

2780
03:00:23,470 --> 03:00:24,170
Oh.

2781
03:00:26,490 --> 03:00:27,890
Oh, wait.

2782
03:00:28,150 --> 03:00:28,890
Lucky us.

2783
03:00:32,250 --> 03:00:32,950
Wait.

2784
03:00:33,450 --> 03:00:33,850
No, no, no.

2785
03:00:36,510 --> 03:00:37,850
Oh, my gosh.

2786
03:00:38,910 --> 03:00:40,210
Let's just try pink.

2787
03:00:42,550 --> 03:00:44,050
This one's insane.

2788
03:00:46,250 --> 03:00:47,750
Thanks for showing us your childhood game.

2789
03:00:47,770 --> 03:00:55,470
blue archive love yes oh my gosh yeah it was so cute it was
really fun seeing like some of the um like the other

2790
03:00:55,470 --> 03:01:03,590
characters like the like the delinquent girls and things
like that them kind of in motion and everything it was it

2791
03:01:03,590 --> 03:01:08,840
was fun it was really cute so what what does

2792
03:01:17,770 --> 03:01:30,910
to be okay wait it's got to be green because I think it
corresponds to this grid right the five by five and so it's

2793
03:01:30,910 --> 03:01:48,190
the first one so it's gonna be star maybe let's try paint no
not pink yellow red No.

2794
03:01:58,870 --> 03:01:59,570
Blue.

2795
03:02:03,730 --> 03:02:04,550
Oh, wait, green!

2796
03:02:06,430 --> 03:02:07,950
Oh, wait, this...

2797
03:02:07,950 --> 03:02:09,070
I did the wrong one.

2798
03:02:10,330 --> 03:02:11,050
Green here.

2799
03:02:11,690 --> 03:02:12,330
I'm silly.

2800
03:02:17,130 --> 03:02:17,830
Wait,

2801
03:02:21,270 --> 03:02:22,690
then what's on the third row?

2802
03:02:23,570 --> 03:02:35,570
but I was right about the first column being the green it's
just classic splat dot wave so it's it's correct about the

2803
03:02:35,570 --> 03:02:54,660
green being here and the blues here what determines it down
here though is the question is the big Q a big question try

2804
03:02:54,660 --> 03:03:04,120
different shape but then why would this shape go there wait
the shapes are all messed up too wait are the shapes all

2805
03:03:04,120 --> 03:03:15,360
wacky whack-a-doodle too yeah i think they're different for
each one oh my gosh we did it

2806
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:31,400
nice i think they're different for each one Because if I did
like a square here, would it go up there?

2807
03:03:31,780 --> 03:03:32,900
Let's test it out.

2808
03:03:34,020 --> 03:03:35,640
This is our...

2809
03:03:35,640 --> 03:03:37,600
No, I can't be wasting ink.

2810
03:03:39,360 --> 03:03:42,160
So this is a triangle down here for this, too.

2811
03:03:44,320 --> 03:03:45,560
Oh, not...

2812
03:03:45,560 --> 03:03:49,160
Oh, I was like, don't go wasting ink!

2813
03:03:50,960 --> 03:03:51,280
Huh?

2814
03:03:53,920 --> 03:03:54,540
What?

2815
03:04:01,780 --> 03:04:03,420
Oh yeah, I completed it.

2816
03:04:04,840 --> 03:04:07,840
I completed it and I'm doing hard mode for funsies.

2817
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:08,260
Yeah, yeah.

2818
03:04:08,340 --> 03:04:10,440
I'm just testing out what the...

2819
03:04:15,010 --> 03:04:17,810
I think the shapes can't be in the same column.

2820
03:04:20,090 --> 03:04:21,330
Like, what is the pattern here?

2821
03:04:21,710 --> 03:04:23,530
There's obviously the color which we got.

2822
03:04:26,830 --> 03:04:27,670
Are they di...

2823
03:04:27,670 --> 03:04:28,850
No, they're not diagonal.

2824
03:04:31,990 --> 03:04:32,250
...

2825
03:04:32,250 --> 03:04:32,930
...

2826
03:04:37,450 --> 03:04:39,430
It feels so random.

2827
03:04:40,010 --> 03:04:41,830
It feels so random.

2828
03:04:47,780 --> 03:04:51,580
So the one next to it can't be touching the same shape.

2829
03:04:51,720 --> 03:04:52,720
Is that what you guys are saying?

2830
03:04:55,500 --> 03:04:56,460
Like a Sudoku?

2831
03:04:58,400 --> 03:04:59,240
Kind of.

2832
03:04:59,940 --> 03:05:00,640
Ink don't...

2833
03:05:00,640 --> 03:05:01,700
What?

2834
03:05:02,480 --> 03:05:04,080
We ran out of ink so fast.

2835
03:05:04,140 --> 03:05:06,460
They don't even let you experiment a little.

2836
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:07,740
No way!

2837
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:08,700
Okay, so pink.

2838
03:05:08,840 --> 03:05:10,000
Let's try and get this next three.

2839
03:05:11,080 --> 03:05:12,400
but how will i

2840
03:05:17,160 --> 03:05:22,240
i figured this game would only have like 10 games total i'm
shocked that you're still playing it i'm going i'm going

2841
03:05:22,240 --> 03:05:33,420
through stuff i'm going through it no just um you have all
the info you need okay so maybe it's not a circle then thank

2842
03:05:51,970 --> 03:06:03,210
you so much thank you thank you thank you and uh oh so it's
gonna be red is the only one So close, so close.

2843
03:06:03,330 --> 03:06:04,330
Oh my gosh.

2844
03:06:04,910 --> 03:06:05,610
Oh my gosh.

2845
03:06:06,550 --> 03:06:07,010
Square?

2846
03:06:07,910 --> 03:06:09,370
How would it, why would it be square?

2847
03:06:15,950 --> 03:06:17,150
You were right though.

2848
03:06:17,450 --> 03:06:17,930
But why?

2849
03:06:19,370 --> 03:06:22,470
The shape is two to the right and one up.

2850
03:06:23,490 --> 03:06:23,730
Huh?

2851
03:06:25,350 --> 03:06:25,830
Huh?

2852
03:06:28,310 --> 03:06:28,770
Huh?

2853
03:06:29,130 --> 03:06:30,010
I think we're out of ink.

2854
03:06:31,270 --> 03:06:34,370
Oh, we get one more shot.

2855
03:06:34,730 --> 03:06:35,990
We could save two more.

2856
03:06:36,010 --> 03:06:36,430
Or maybe.

2857
03:06:38,990 --> 03:06:41,270
Let's do the green because we know this one.

2858
03:06:43,730 --> 03:06:48,330
And it's red inside.

2859
03:06:49,810 --> 03:06:50,650
Mint is loading.

2860
03:06:51,730 --> 03:06:53,830
I need, hold on, isn't there a thing for this?

2861
03:06:55,490 --> 03:06:56,130
One second.

2862
03:06:57,270 --> 03:07:00,070
I think there's a...

2863
03:07:06,520 --> 03:07:06,920
Ah.

2864
03:07:08,460 --> 03:07:08,980
Wait.

2865
03:07:10,380 --> 03:07:11,420
Yeah, I got it.

03:07:20,190 --> 03:07:27,570

2868
03:07:41,600 --> 03:07:52,900
at this for this one we save the final tool No more ink
left.

2869
03:07:53,360 --> 03:07:55,540
Yes, Zumbinis were left behind.

2870
03:07:56,140 --> 03:07:58,080
But the knowledge was gained.

2871
03:07:59,040 --> 03:08:01,160
Press on Brave Explorer.

2872
03:08:01,460 --> 03:08:02,340
Oh no!

2873
03:08:03,100 --> 03:08:07,180
Yes, Zumbinis were left behind.

2874
03:08:08,540 --> 03:08:11,040
Oh my gosh, they encourage you to leave them.

2875
03:08:11,940 --> 03:08:13,360
What about this one, I wonder?

2876
03:08:14,500 --> 03:08:16,780
Oh, okay, anyway.

2877
03:08:23,840 --> 03:08:25,560
This one actually looks kind of fun.

2878
03:08:26,260 --> 03:08:26,900
I'm not gonna lie.

2879
03:08:27,620 --> 03:08:30,380
There's also, I knew, I remember there being another one up
here.

2880
03:08:37,600 --> 03:08:38,260
What is this?

2881
03:08:40,380 --> 03:08:41,520
What does this do?

2882
03:08:41,920 --> 03:08:42,680
What are these?

2883
03:08:52,290 --> 03:08:53,150
Wait, what happened?

2884
03:08:57,340 --> 03:08:58,340
Galaxy hole.

2885
03:08:59,320 --> 03:09:01,500

left?

2890
03:09:34,260 --> 03:09:35,960
This is the thing that creates the bubbles.

2891
03:09:44,510 --> 03:09:44,910
What is the...

2892
03:09:44,910 --> 03:09:48,290
Okay, I'm going to test this because I want to know...

2893
03:09:49,290 --> 03:09:50,670
What the yellow and the...

2894
03:09:50,670 --> 03:09:51,490
What all this does?

2895
03:09:52,010 --> 03:09:53,230
I want to know what the green does.

2896
03:09:53,370 --> 03:09:54,410
I want to know what the yellow does.

2897
03:09:56,230 --> 03:09:56,430
Oh, wait.

2898
03:09:56,490 --> 03:09:57,710
Maybe it...

2899
03:09:57,710 --> 03:09:58,190
Aha.

2900
03:09:59,070 --> 03:09:59,430
Aha.

2901
03:09:59,710 --> 03:10:00,230
It does.

2902
03:10:00,390 --> 03:10:01,390
Okay, what does the green do?

2903
03:10:07,740 --> 03:10:08,040
Huh?

2904
03:10:09,040 --> 03:10:09,900
Are you stuck?

2905
03:10:10,840 --> 03:10:11,100
Uh-oh.

2906
03:10:11,740 --> 03:10:14,560
I think my Zoombini is trapped.

2907
03:10:18,650 --> 03:10:20,630
If I push her...

2908
03:10:20,630 --> 03:10:22,710
Oh, maybe I can, like, push her over.

2909
03:10:25,130 --> 03:10:25,490
Maybe?

2910
03:10:30,990 --> 03:10:33,630
Let's send, uh...

2911
03:10:33,630 --> 03:10:36,250
I feel like some of these, I have to...

2912
03:10:36,250 --> 03:10:38,570
When I do them, it sends them to their doom.

2913
03:10:41,210 --> 03:10:41,490
Hmm.

2914
03:10:41,750 --> 03:10:42,670
Send another one?

2915
03:10:46,770 --> 03:10:50,090
Oh wait, I think I just uh...

2916
03:10:50,090 --> 03:10:50,530
Uh oh.

2917
03:10:51,850 --> 03:10:52,330
Goodbye!

2918
03:10:56,630 --> 03:10:57,270
Sayonara!

2919
03:10:58,070 --> 03:11:00,910
Let's try, um, this way.

2920
03:11:09,700 --> 03:11:10,860
Look, now we're safe.

2921
03:11:12,100 --> 03:11:12,860
Yeah.

2922
03:11:16,160 --> 03:11:17,180
Here we go.

2923
03:11:19,880 --> 03:11:20,640
Push.

2924
03:11:21,440 --> 03:11:23,140
Push her, push, push.

2925
03:11:25,140 --> 03:11:26,280
Dumbini's.

2926
03:11:26,440 --> 03:11:26,560
Oh.

2927
03:11:27,420 --> 03:11:30,060
You murdered her!

2928
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:32,600
You murderer!

2929
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:34,280
You!

2930
03:11:34,720 --> 03:11:37,320
You killed her!

2931
03:11:37,500 --> 03:11:39,120
You killed her!

2932
03:11:49,780 --> 03:11:53,940
I cannot believe the...

2933
03:11:54,520 --> 03:11:56,160
This is...

2934
03:11:56,160 --> 03:11:57,740
I'm disgusted.

2935
03:11:58,220 --> 03:12:00,560
I'm disgusted in this display right now.

2936
03:12:01,060 --> 03:12:11,580
even i can't even i can't i cannot even deal with these zoom
vines any longer hold on i want to see this one huh it

2937
03:12:11,580 --> 03:12:28,100
doesn't tell you it just says you figure it out that's very
hard mode it just doesn't tell you that is so funny thank

2938
03:12:28,100 --> 03:12:33,120
you where do the zoom vines go when they get accident lead.

2939
03:12:33,520 --> 03:12:34,580
They go back to camp.

2940
03:12:34,740 --> 03:12:35,240
It's fine.

2941
03:12:35,480 --> 03:12:35,940
They're fine.

2942
03:12:40,880 --> 03:12:41,920
I like the music in that one.

2943
03:12:42,020 --> 03:12:43,060
What one haven't we seen?

2944
03:12:43,700 --> 03:12:44,200
This one?

2945
03:12:44,400 --> 03:12:50,120
I think it's probably the same as like the bridge.

2946
03:12:52,020 --> 03:12:53,460
I think we've seen everything else.

2947
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:55,440
Very cool.

2948
03:13:03,310 --> 03:13:04,030
Very cool.

2949
03:13:04,890 --> 03:13:06,190
They go to the shadow realm.

2950
03:13:06,750 --> 03:13:07,770
Crystal?

2951
03:13:08,290 --> 03:13:09,750
We did the crystal one too.

2952
03:13:15,850 --> 03:13:17,970
That was fun.

2953
03:13:19,170 --> 03:13:21,390
What a blast from the past.

2954
03:13:23,010 --> 03:13:23,530
Hold on.

2955
03:13:26,770 --> 03:13:31,990
I am going to go here.

2956
03:13:32,830 --> 03:13:33,270
Hello.

2957
03:13:34,210 --> 03:13:34,530
Hello.

2958
03:13:35,910 --> 03:13:36,670
Oh,

2959
03:13:41,030 --> 03:13:42,350
I am too slow.

2960
03:13:49,780 --> 03:13:50,540
Ouch!

2961
03:13:51,700 --> 03:13:52,320
Stop it!

2962
03:13:54,260 --> 03:13:56,740
Let me close out of Zoom Viennese real quick.

2963
03:13:56,900 --> 03:14:02,920
Let me put on some BGM and give me a second.

2964
03:14:04,120 --> 03:14:04,480
BGM.

2965
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:05,720
BGM.

2966
03:14:06,940 --> 03:14:07,700
BGM.

2967
03:14:08,880 --> 03:14:14,420

awesome revisiting that for sure my brain hurts from some of

2971
03:15:10,250 --> 03:15:19,130
those I didn't expect the very very hard to be as difficult
as it was But they surpassed my expectations entirely.

2972
03:15:20,850 --> 03:15:22,310
Good job showing off your mighty brain cell.

2973
03:15:23,850 --> 03:15:24,730
Thank you.

2974
03:15:25,170 --> 03:15:26,010
Thank you.

2975
03:15:26,590 --> 03:15:27,990
I know, you might be intimidated.

2976
03:15:28,910 --> 03:15:35,870
You might be intimidated by how well I was able to perceive
things.

2977
03:15:36,810 --> 03:15:45,070
But you too can become my level at some point.

2978
03:15:45,170 --> 03:15:46,650
Thanks for streaming, Mint.

2979
03:15:47,030 --> 03:15:47,510
Thank you.

2980
03:15:47,710 --> 03:15:48,290
Thanks for the stream.

2981
03:15:48,490 --> 03:15:48,710
Thank you.

2982
03:15:48,830 --> 03:15:50,410
I will be reading donations out.

2983
03:15:50,990 --> 03:15:54,890
So if you're going to head out, see you later.

2984
03:15:56,250 --> 03:16:02,210
Tomorrow I have off because the podcast will be released.

2985
03:16:03,230 --> 03:16:05,490
So, yeah.

2986
03:16:06,370 --> 03:16:08,260
And, mm-mm.

2987
03:16:09,530 --> 03:16:11,150
Podcast Mondays.

2988
03:16:11,770 --> 03:16:12,290
Yippee!

2989
03:16:22,010 --> 03:16:24,950
That really made me want pizza more than anything.

2990
03:16:28,570 --> 03:16:30,110
I'm buying this game now.

2991
03:16:30,530 --> 03:16:31,610
Completely missed it way back when.

2992
03:16:31,690 --> 03:16:33,010
Thanks for the stream, Minty.

2993
03:16:33,670 --> 03:16:34,310
Of course.

2994
03:16:36,310 --> 03:16:36,930
Of course.

2995
03:16:37,290 --> 03:16:40,430
I think it's going to be an uptick in Zumbini sales maybe.

2996
03:16:40,710 --> 03:16:41,710
It is very fun, though.

2997
03:16:43,170 --> 03:16:43,690
And it's...

2998
03:16:43,690 --> 03:16:44,330
I didn't realize.

2999
03:16:44,450 --> 03:16:45,090
I never noticed.

3000
03:16:45,170 --> 03:16:53,630
that on the map it showed like how many Zumbinis were left
on Zumbini Island yeah, but Zumbini Island right and then

3001
03:16:53,630 --> 03:17:11,530
you move them to no Zumbini Island wait Zumbini Isle is the
new one right Zumbini Pachinko machine I hope never no yeah

3002
03:17:11,530 --> 03:17:17,330
Zumbini Island to Zumbini that's right Zumbini island to
Zumbiniville.

3003
03:17:18,150 --> 03:17:19,410
That's right, that's right, that's right.

3004
03:17:21,850 --> 03:17:22,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3005
03:17:25,090 --> 03:17:26,830
what happens when you get all to the island?

3006
03:17:26,910 --> 03:17:30,710
I have no idea, because I think as a kid, I never noticed
that there was an amount.

3007
03:17:31,850 --> 03:17:33,970
But I always just played it.

3008
03:17:34,570 --> 03:17:35,070
I don't even know.

3009
03:17:35,130 --> 03:17:37,870
Maybe that's a new edition from the original game.

3010
03:17:38,530 --> 03:17:38,990
Who knows?

3011
03:17:39,530 --> 03:17:41,590
But as a kid, I just never noticed it.

3012
03:17:42,290 --> 03:17:42,650
Yeah.

3013
03:17:43,290 --> 03:17:45,730
I got to squeeze in a run to the Thanks!

3014
03:17:46,310 --> 03:17:47,230
No problem!

3015
03:17:49,610 --> 03:17:51,810
Let's get this off my head.

3016
03:17:52,150 --> 03:17:52,350
Goodbye!

3017
03:17:53,810 --> 03:17:54,470
Goodbye, goodbye.

3018
03:17:54,970 --> 03:17:57,190
Here, let's put something else on my head.

3019
03:17:59,250 --> 03:18:00,010
Um...

3020
03:18:03,910 --> 03:18:04,670
Um...

3021
03:18:04,670 --> 03:18:05,170
Um...

3022
03:18:05,730 --> 03:18:06,710
This is me.

3023
03:18:08,770 --> 03:18:09,890
I'm bread.

3024
03:18:11,930 --> 03:18:13,070
I'm bread.

3025
03:18:13,830 --> 03:18:14,430
Ha ha ha.

3026
03:18:16,490 --> 03:18:18,010
Because I'm Braindead.

3027
03:18:19,490 --> 03:18:20,490
You're a soup.

3028
03:18:20,950 --> 03:18:21,470
Thank you!

3029
03:18:22,030 --> 03:18:22,770
Thanks for the fun stream.

3030
03:18:22,990 --> 03:18:23,770
Go see my friends.

3031
03:18:24,370 --> 03:18:27,110
Who doesn't watch VTubers, but loves Zumbini's was watching.

3032
03:18:27,530 --> 03:18:28,190
And had a blast.

3033
03:18:28,710 --> 03:18:30,690
As for those we lost, we won't see them.

3034
03:18:30,890 --> 03:18:31,690
And as ashes.

3035
03:18:32,210 --> 03:18:33,550
They're all diamonds.

3036
03:18:33,950 --> 03:18:35,530
They are diamonds, Zumbini.

3037
03:18:35,710 --> 03:18:36,370
So true.

3038
03:18:37,990 --> 03:18:40,630
I hope this becomes the next flavor of the month streamer
game.

3039
03:18:40,710 --> 03:18:42,790
So VTubers everywhere can show the world what they are.

3040
03:18:43,030 --> 03:18:45,150
That they are not, in fact, smarter than...

3041
03:18:45,170 --> 03:18:47,030
than a first grader.

3042
03:18:47,290 --> 03:18:47,730
Hey!

3043
03:18:49,290 --> 03:18:50,910
I proved myself.

3044
03:18:52,690 --> 03:18:54,650
I proved myself pretty well, I think.

3045
03:18:56,690 --> 03:19:02,210
Now that the Microsoft cops can't stop us, are you gonna fly
us all the way to Akiva in real time and flight sim?

3046
03:19:02,570 --> 03:19:07,530
I, oh my gosh, Koran, it's so crazy to bring that up because
I was watching something yesterday and they brought up

3047
03:19:07,530 --> 03:19:10,930
flight simulator and I was like, I can do that.

3048
03:19:12,930 --> 03:19:14,730
So, 12 hour stream, baby.

3049
03:19:15,170 --> 03:19:16,790
Let's fly to Japan!

3050
03:19:19,370 --> 03:19:20,750
We can fly!

3051
03:19:21,450 --> 03:19:22,150
We can fly!

3052
03:19:22,530 --> 03:19:22,990
We can fly!

3053
03:19:23,190 --> 03:19:23,930
We can fly!

3054
03:19:24,190 --> 03:19:24,730
We can fly!

3055
03:19:24,930 --> 03:19:25,530
We can fly!

3056
03:19:25,530 --> 03:19:25,750
We can fly!

3057
03:19:26,010 --> 03:19:28,210
I've always wanted to do that.

3058
03:19:29,110 --> 03:19:31,330
So, um...

3059
03:19:31,330 --> 03:19:31,830
It's funny.

3060
03:19:33,810 --> 03:19:37,630
Maybe I should have done it, uh...

3061
03:19:37,630 --> 03:19:41,170
back when I streamed three years ago, but...

3062
03:19:42,730 --> 03:19:43,190
Oh well.

3063
03:19:43,730 --> 03:19:54,590
How... I do wonder though like how much do i need to know
your boss of flying a plane to do it i i actually have

3064
03:19:54,590 --> 03:20:03,710
looked into getting a pilot's license before but oh my gosh
the cost of getting a pilot's license is actually insane not

3065
03:20:03,710 --> 03:20:20,350
that i have a plane to fly anyway but um my uh my um one of
my old bosses uh had a a pilot's license and so um i don't

3066
03:20:20,350 --> 03:20:31,850
know maybe maybe i should ask him hey can you teach me how
to fly uh it was a semi-popular thing to do in my union what

3067
03:20:31,850 --> 03:20:45,430
do you go to a uni of people like who sleep on gold getting
a pilot's license is so expensive I just want to, you know,

3068
03:20:45,670 --> 03:20:48,750
as a ghost, I can fly anyway, but I just kind of want to
look.

3069
03:20:49,630 --> 03:20:53,430
Well, I, not, fly is like a, I could float.

3070
03:20:54,950 --> 03:21:03,710
Fly is like a big word, you know, but, um, pilot's license
for small planes is easy and not that bad.

3071
03:21:04,630 --> 03:21:12,930
Okay, I'm going to say the price that I saw, and anyone who
wants to confirm can confirm.

3072
03:21:15,490 --> 03:21:25,950
I saw it was for $10,000 US dollars is that correct oh I
heard about 10k see?

3073
03:21:26,290 --> 03:21:26,390
See?

3074
03:21:26,770 --> 03:21:36,990
That's what I heard that's what I googled and it told me I
googled and yeah that's about right oh my god 10k is low oh

3075
03:21:36,990 --> 03:21:39,650
my god we got Mr. Morebucks over here

3076
03:21:46,240 --> 03:21:48,240
is like 150k!

3077
03:21:50,660 --> 03:21:52,080
You're a student.

3078
03:21:57,940 --> 03:22:00,540
10k is low for a pilot's license though.

3079
03:22:00,900 --> 03:22:00,900
Okay.

3080
03:22:01,980 --> 03:22:05,460
It's like seven MGS3 Apache slot machines.

3081
03:22:07,720 --> 03:22:08,420
Sheesh.

3082
03:22:11,640 --> 03:22:12,880
Do pilots make good money?

3083
03:22:13,480 --> 03:22:16,980
Like say if I were a pilot for some big company.

3084
03:22:17,480 --> 03:22:25,060
Do they make the that you have to pay 150 000 i mean

3085
03:22:28,160 --> 03:22:41,900
okay when i think about it okay hold on that doesn't include
school right because some some colleges in the united states

3086
03:22:41,900 --> 03:22:56,160
cost that much intuition and things like that so it doesn't
include school It's just like the test.

3087
03:22:58,440 --> 03:22:59,860
That's so crazy.

3088
03:23:02,260 --> 03:23:03,620
That's so crazy.

3089
03:23:04,120 --> 03:23:06,440
Not that I would get the commercial license anyway.

3090
03:23:11,100 --> 03:23:12,940
But actually, I don't know.

3091
03:23:13,300 --> 03:23:13,640
Like, what?

3092
03:23:13,840 --> 03:23:14,540
Okay, what?

3093
03:23:15,380 --> 03:23:15,800
What?

3094
03:23:16,340 --> 03:23:19,200
How commercial are we talking?

3095
03:23:19,440 --> 03:23:20,180
Because if I...

3096
03:23:22,180 --> 03:23:23,980
If I'm just like, hey, guys.

3097
03:23:24,180 --> 03:23:37,620
a plane but I need you to pay for my time is that commercial
I mean if I'm not like if I don't have a business if I'm

3098
03:23:37,620 --> 03:23:43,900
just sometimes like oh and you can tell your friends that I
have a plane but I'm gonna charge them a little bit more

3099
03:23:43,900 --> 03:23:52,240
because they're not my friends you know getting the 747 mint

3100
03:23:55,840 --> 03:23:57,760
You guys, I'm going to fly a Boeing.

3101
03:24:01,520 --> 03:24:03,620
Okay, next stream idea.

3102
03:24:12,520 --> 03:24:14,760
If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me.

3103
03:24:17,520 --> 03:24:18,820
Boeing hand cam.

3104
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:24,840
I'm not ready to die yet.

3105
03:24:26,080 --> 03:24:26,740
It's okay.

3106
03:24:26,900 --> 03:24:28,120
Your whips, your whips.

3107
03:24:30,020 --> 03:24:31,600
Your whips, your whips.

3108
03:24:33,580 --> 03:24:34,100
Oh,

3109
03:24:37,340 --> 03:24:40,040
it's so scary that I have to check every time now.

3110
03:24:40,640 --> 03:24:48,520
When I'm like getting a flight, I'm just like, this is, this
is, this is, this is, I don't want to have anxiety the

3111
03:24:48,520 --> 03:24:50,320
entire flight, you know what I mean?

3112
03:24:53,160 --> 03:24:54,200
Worth it.

3113
03:24:54,740 --> 03:24:57,860
The crash landing on a deserted island stream.

3114
03:25:02,620 --> 03:25:04,220
Rest in pieces.

3115
03:25:07,920 --> 03:25:12,260
Sorry, Mint, I want my pilot to be able to recognize their
Zumbini's name.

3116
03:25:12,560 --> 03:25:16,940
I don't think I could even become a pilot anyway because you
have to have good vision, right?

3117
03:25:18,100 --> 03:25:19,760
Unfortunately, I wear contacts.

3118
03:25:21,160 --> 03:25:21,940
Even as a ghost.

3119
03:25:22,760 --> 03:25:26,660
You're thinking, even in death, my vision would be better.

3120
03:25:30,820 --> 03:25:31,520
Oh, it's a myth!

3121
03:25:35,680 --> 03:25:41,040
Did you guys know that, actually, I don't know if this is
only Delta.

3122
03:25:42,700 --> 03:25:46,420
I saw videos on it, but I think everyone that I saw with the
videos did Delta.

3123
03:25:47,360 --> 03:25:54,960
But, um, some, some pilots have trading cards of their, of
the plane.

3124
03:25:56,940 --> 03:25:59,400
So if you're just like, hi, can I talk to the pilot?

3125
03:26:00,260 --> 03:26:02,720
And you can collect cards of the planes.

3126
03:26:03,080 --> 03:26:04,200
Isn't that so awesome?

3127
03:26:04,620 --> 03:26:11,160
I wanted to do it last time, but I was really, I was like,
what if they, what if they were like, what, what the hell

3128
03:26:11,160 --> 03:26:11,940
are you talking about?

3129
03:26:12,060 --> 03:26:14,760
I was like, I was nervous to ask.

3130
03:26:16,020 --> 03:26:16,460
Wait, really?

3131
03:26:16,580 --> 03:26:17,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3132
03:26:17,760 --> 03:26:18,580
Look it up, look it up.

3133
03:26:19,540 --> 03:26:20,360
It's so cool.

3134
03:26:22,420 --> 03:26:24,660
I don't know if it's just Delta though.

3135
03:26:29,060 --> 03:26:33,740
But every time I've watched a video about it, the pilots are
so nice.

3136
03:26:33,740 --> 03:26:37,200
But I think because it went viral on TikTok, a lot of people
have been asking.

3137
03:26:37,380 --> 03:26:40,920
And so the pilots will be like, the pilots will be like, oh,
I'm out.

3138
03:26:41,260 --> 03:26:43,600
People keep asking for these all of a sudden.

3139
03:26:48,780 --> 03:26:54,060
Sorry, Minto, if I hear this is your captain speaking and
it's your voice, I'm jumping right out right there.

3140
03:26:54,780 --> 03:26:58,760
And then this is your captain speaking.

3141
03:27:00,120 --> 03:27:03,360
The local temperature is...

3142
03:27:07,200 --> 03:27:20,440
is uh you need a sweater but like a really light sweater you
know and we're coming in at an altitude of craziness so

3143
03:27:20,440 --> 03:27:22,920
buckle up baby woo

3144
03:27:28,040 --> 03:27:34,520
have you seen that furry who's a technician and writes oh
whoa on the fuel tank of all i have seen that i have seen

3145
03:27:34,520 --> 03:27:51,160
that so crazy so funny buckle up whisperoos we're going

3146
03:27:51,160 --> 03:28:05,160

straight through there's so many mysteries about ghosts so

3147
03:28:05,160 --> 03:28:11,060
many oh I just went to, that's funny, I went to YouTube
because I was like, time to read super chats.

3148
03:28:11,560 --> 03:28:12,600
I don't have super chats.

3149
03:28:14,900 --> 03:28:15,360
Can I?

3150
03:28:16,840 --> 03:28:17,740
I don't even.

3151
03:28:21,340 --> 03:28:32,060
Yeah, I'll show, like, I'm almost halfway to the amount of
hours that I need to get monetization.

3152
03:28:33,000 --> 03:28:33,780
So we'll see.

3153
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:34,440
I don't know.

3154
03:28:35,980 --> 03:28:37,700
I'm not going to worry about it, though.

3155
03:28:39,180 --> 03:28:40,880
I'm not too concerned, to be honest.

3156
03:28:42,440 --> 03:28:43,120
Force of habit.

3157
03:28:47,440 --> 03:28:48,500
Are they going to...

3158
03:28:48,500 --> 03:28:50,320
I'll get LASIK if they...

3159
03:28:50,320 --> 03:28:51,360
What's the word?

3160
03:28:51,620 --> 03:28:53,640
They put Shady Gun in my eyes.

3161
03:29:00,680 --> 03:29:04,060
How long do you have to be inactive for where it resets?

3162
03:29:04,240 --> 03:29:04,600
I don't know.

3163
03:29:05,120 --> 03:29:05,860
It was a long time ago.

3164
03:29:05,880 --> 03:29:21,840
time I can't remember though maybe like several months like
three months or something I don't know I'll I don't think I

3165
03:29:21,840 --> 03:29:27,080
have the emails anymore where it's just like hey you're
gonna not get have membership I mean you're gonna have

3166
03:29:27,080 --> 03:29:34,100
monetization anymore oh I don't have like a thing that says
don't know reading hold on

3167
03:29:37,480 --> 03:29:38,620
Next.

3168
03:29:42,000 --> 03:29:44,660
Donation reading time.

3169
03:29:45,880 --> 03:29:46,980
Thank you.

3170
03:29:48,360 --> 03:29:48,940
Let's see.

3171
03:29:49,480 --> 03:29:50,630
I need a font.

3172
03:29:52,620 --> 03:29:52,920
Oh.

3173
03:29:58,180 --> 03:29:58,560
Oh.

3174
03:29:59,600 --> 03:30:00,680
Beep.

3175
03:30:01,960 --> 03:30:04,880
And then now let's outline it.

3176
03:30:05,880 --> 03:30:36,780
line it in mint like a little more like that cool yippee
mint mint mint mint mint you're a simp you might not become

3177
03:30:36,780 --> 03:30:43,920
a pilot but now that you're out of heaven you could get that
forklift certification i could i could get forklift

3178
03:30:43,920 --> 03:30:53,920
certified if i wanted to perhaps i should mint phantom
certified forklifter

3179
03:30:58,950 --> 03:31:11,230
let's put it right why is it so why is it like that why is
it space like that also i don't think i like the Everything

3180
03:31:11,230 --> 03:31:12,430
being capitalized.

3181
03:31:16,410 --> 03:31:17,610
That's better.

3182
03:31:20,870 --> 03:31:23,310
Are my box certified?

3183
03:31:25,870 --> 03:31:27,610
Look into the game DCS.

3184
03:31:27,750 --> 03:31:29,230
You get to fly fighter jets.

3185
03:31:29,590 --> 03:31:30,770
The game is very, very hard.

3186
03:31:31,170 --> 03:31:32,190
You need a HOTUS.

3187
03:31:32,870 --> 03:31:35,130
But you want to try...

3188
03:31:35,130 --> 03:31:35,490
Wait.

3189
03:31:35,950 --> 03:31:39,650
But you want to try to fly a game that is a step above
Microsoft.

3190
03:31:39,670 --> 03:31:40,910
Microsoft flight.

3191
03:31:41,490 --> 03:31:44,150
You can fly like Maverick and do air support for Snake.

3192
03:31:44,530 --> 03:31:47,070
The 15th Super Hornet is a play-the-key.

3193
03:31:48,030 --> 03:31:49,930
One step at a time, maybe.

3194
03:31:51,990 --> 03:31:53,370
One step at a time, maybe.

3195
03:32:03,660 --> 03:32:09,600
My new job has me driving a forklift, and I can confirm that
they're simultaneously very fun and very frustrating.

3196
03:32:11,080 --> 03:32:13,100
It's not like, uh...

3197
03:32:13,100 --> 03:32:13,900
What's the word?

3198
03:32:15,420 --> 03:32:17,640
It's not a stick shift, but they're...

3199
03:32:17,660 --> 03:32:20,740
There's like a lever you have to pull and stuff, isn't
there?

3200
03:32:21,840 --> 03:32:22,600
Am I going crazy?

3201
03:32:26,240 --> 03:32:27,540
DCS is not a game.

3202
03:32:27,780 --> 03:32:28,620
It's a job.

3203
03:32:36,060 --> 03:32:38,600
But yeah, I'm going to read Streamlabs now.

3204
03:32:38,920 --> 03:32:39,900
Actually, I don't...

3205
03:32:39,900 --> 03:32:41,500
Streamlabs has changed so much.

3206
03:32:41,700 --> 03:32:43,340
I can't...

3207
03:32:43,340 --> 03:32:46,040
Okay, I think if I go to here, I'll be able to read it.

3208
03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:47,460
E...

3209
03:32:50,120 --> 03:32:52,580
Yes, wait, why is it showing me?

3210
03:32:53,100 --> 03:32:55,300
11 minutes ago and then 3 years ago.

3211
03:32:55,660 --> 03:32:55,940
Stop it.

3212
03:33:00,360 --> 03:33:02,880
Thanks for bringing back the good morning tweets.

3213
03:33:05,080 --> 03:33:06,600
Well, in the past I used to say, ohaminto.

3214
03:33:11,080 --> 03:33:13,200
But, I don't know.

3215
03:33:13,660 --> 03:33:16,140
I can say ohaminto or good morning minto or whatever.

3216
03:33:16,520 --> 03:33:17,440
Three years ago.

3217
03:33:18,620 --> 03:33:19,680
I think this is...

3218
03:33:19,680 --> 03:33:20,800
No, wait, hold on.

3219
03:33:20,900 --> 03:33:22,120
This doesn't work either.

3220
03:33:22,760 --> 03:33:25,320
No, Streamlabs, why do you have to change everything?

3221
03:33:26,400 --> 03:33:27,060
I can't.

3222
03:33:27,220 --> 03:33:27,520
Wait, this?

3223
03:33:27,640 --> 03:33:27,780
Okay.

3224
03:33:27,940 --> 03:33:29,440
Oh, I have to go here.

3225
03:33:30,120 --> 03:33:30,820
Tip history.

3226
03:33:31,920 --> 03:33:32,160
Ah!

3227
03:33:32,540 --> 03:33:33,600
I figured it out.

3228
03:33:35,120 --> 03:33:36,920
I figured it out.

3229
03:33:38,480 --> 03:33:39,000
What's today?

3230
03:33:39,520 --> 03:33:39,940
Seventh.

3231
03:33:40,740 --> 03:33:41,300
Seven.

3232
03:33:42,920 --> 03:33:44,000
George Costanza.

3233
03:33:44,600 --> 03:33:45,160
Seven.

3234
03:33:50,140 --> 03:33:50,700
Oh.

3235
03:33:51,520 --> 03:33:53,520
I think I just messed something up.

3236
03:33:55,040 --> 03:33:55,960
Come on.

3237
03:33:55,960 --> 03:33:56,340
Come on.

3238
03:33:56,340 --> 03:33:58,680
OBS, I messed something up too.

3239
03:34:01,420 --> 03:34:01,860
Stop.

3240
03:34:02,920 --> 03:34:04,040
OBS, why did you...

3241
03:34:04,040 --> 03:34:04,460
Okay.

3242
03:34:05,540 --> 03:34:06,460
Everything is bad.

3243
03:34:08,540 --> 03:34:09,820
Offering to my local ghost.

3244
03:34:10,320 --> 03:34:11,180
Thank you!

3245
03:34:13,240 --> 03:34:14,300
He-he-haha.

3246
03:34:17,140 --> 03:34:18,380
I just got here.

3247
03:34:18,440 --> 03:34:19,240
Why are you bread?

3248
03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:21,220
Because my brain is dead.

3249
03:34:21,240 --> 03:34:21,860
dead.

3250
03:34:22,420 --> 03:34:25,280
My brain is dead from Zumbini time.

3251
03:34:29,040 --> 03:34:30,340
My brain is dead.

3252
03:34:32,480 --> 03:34:34,860
The heart was actually difficult.

3253
03:34:35,320 --> 03:34:35,940
I'm so shocked.

3254
03:34:36,840 --> 03:34:37,460
I'm so shocked.

3255
03:34:39,160 --> 03:34:39,400
Okay.

3256
03:34:40,140 --> 03:34:40,880
Let's see.

3257
03:34:42,840 --> 03:34:50,080
I'm getting hungry for dinner, so I'm gonna read through
these and then I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

3258
03:34:51,020 --> 03:34:51,560
Oh my I know.

3259
03:34:52,080 --> 03:34:53,240
It's a horror game though.

3260
03:34:53,400 --> 03:34:54,080
Oh no, I'm scared.

3261
03:35:06,500 --> 03:35:07,420
I'm scared.

3262
03:35:07,540 --> 03:35:11,420
A soup.

3263
03:35:24,870 --> 03:35:27,110
She was a streamlabs from zero minutes ago.

3264
03:35:27,330 --> 03:35:27,690
Thanks.

3265
03:35:27,910 --> 03:35:28,850
Can I have a piece of that bread?

3266
03:35:30,890 --> 03:35:32,890
You're wanting my...

3267
03:35:32,890 --> 03:35:35,830
You're wanting my...

3268
03:35:39,330 --> 03:35:56,670
brain you want a piece of my brain bread equals brain is
dead yeah bread brain dead if we're airing our flight sim

3269
03:35:56,670 --> 03:36:07,630
rainworms I think that IL-2 Sturmovic is a better game for
learning the basics of basics of combat flight than DCS

3270
03:36:07,630 --> 03:36:17,490
flying world war two prop planes teaches you better
fundamentals oh my god start at the basics okay where's my

3271
03:36:17,490 --> 03:36:30,070
right brother's sim then guys if i'm starting at the basics
i'm starting at the basics i want we need the right brothers

3272
03:36:30,070 --> 03:36:39,890
here then i'll move on from that to basic never build it
yourself Icarus sim?

3273
03:36:40,070 --> 03:36:41,650
Oh, we're going way back then.

3274
03:36:42,090 --> 03:36:42,550
Oh, true.

3275
03:36:43,770 --> 03:36:46,270
We gotta go even further beyond.

3276
03:36:47,770 --> 03:36:49,950
Offering to our local Ryan costume.

3277
03:36:51,050 --> 03:36:52,270
He's not here.

3278
03:36:52,690 --> 03:36:53,650
Is he?

3279
03:36:56,410 --> 03:36:57,410
Mr. Ryan.

3280
03:36:58,610 --> 03:37:00,430
I missed Mint Phantom so much.

3281
03:37:00,630 --> 03:37:02,250
Mint cheer, mint cheer, mint cheer.

3282
03:37:02,890 --> 03:37:03,570
Thanks, Ryan.

3283
03:37:04,590 --> 03:37:06,610
Hopefully we'll have emotes again soon.

3284
03:37:07,630 --> 03:37:20,870
emotes when i do when i get um emotes back we'll do karaoke
hopefully my flight my flight dang it no my voice it's

3285
03:37:20,870 --> 03:37:25,490
because i read flight in the chat hopefully my voice will be
better by then

3286
03:37:31,200 --> 03:37:41,840
oh i'm too influenced this is why i struggle so much with
like um uh you know like how some sing harmonies immediately

3287
03:37:41,840 --> 03:37:51,160
like they'll be like I I like can sing along with the music
but instead of singing the song I'm doing the harmonies I oh

3288
03:37:51,160 --> 03:38:01,120
I struggle so much I like mimic what I hear I mimic what I
read it's so difficult yeah they have the ear for it yeah

3289
03:38:01,120 --> 03:38:11,700
but like how do they like I maybe have I plugged my ears and
do it along maybe it's better maybe The New York Times

3290
03:38:11,700 --> 03:38:17,100
published an opinion article that mankind was millions of
years from inventing powered flight nine days before the

3291
03:38:17,100 --> 03:38:18,680
Wright brothers' first flight.

3292
03:38:20,780 --> 03:38:22,960
Those silly New York Times.

3293
03:38:23,400 --> 03:38:24,480
They don't know anything.

3294
03:38:24,960 --> 03:38:26,460
They're the non-believers.

3295
03:38:28,400 --> 03:38:30,560
The Wright brothers, they were right.

3296
03:38:34,780 --> 03:38:35,660
Good night for me.

3297
03:38:35,700 --> 03:38:36,420
Good night.

3298
03:38:36,980 --> 03:38:37,220
Good night.

3299
03:38:37,400 --> 03:38:37,640
Good night.

3300
03:38:39,860 --> 03:38:44,160
Everything you hear is called Eccolololio

3301
03:38:47,420 --> 03:38:54,580
Actually, there's a game called Rise of Flight that has
World War I and earlier planes And there's an expansion for

3302
03:38:54,580 --> 03:39:08,020
IL-2 That has them added in Flight Sim people are crazy I
love that though Love the passion Okay Some of these are

3305

hate message so I'm just if I have my OBS open and I hear

3306

that I get a donation I'm like

Don't know where I'm and read the messages at the same time.

Yeah, for real.

3350
03:42:09,140 --> 03:42:12,160
This game is etching to my soul from 25 plus years ago.

3351
03:42:12,500 --> 03:42:13,800
Always great to see someone...

3352
03:42:13,820 --> 03:42:15,480
else who can sing along with the soundtrack.

3353
03:42:16,260 --> 03:42:17,280

3354
03:42:19,920 --> 03:42:21,740

3355
03:42:22,040 --> 03:42:23,620
Oh, wait, hold on.

3356
03:42:26,360 --> 03:42:26,800

re-release, but there are ways to do it.

3415

trailer ads for it in the Clue Finder's Game Wanderer.

3463
03:50:23,980 --> 03:50:25,360
Did you ever play any of those games?

3464
03:50:25,480 --> 03:50:26,320

That's a...

3500
03:53:00,100 --> 03:53:02,020
Wait, what time does the store close?

3501
03:53:09,280 --> 03:53:09,740

I have an hour to go to the store.

3505
03:53:14,800 --> 03:53:18,040
I suddenly wanted a very specific cake that is only sold at
a certain store.

3506
03:53:19,280 --> 03:53:20,760
So I'm going to go get that.

Thank you.

3532
03:54:06,460 --> 03:54:12,160

baby game.

03:54:13,980 --> 03:54:14,740

03:54:37,360 --> 03:54:37,960
Fly high, Mint.

3547
03:54:38,320 --> 03:54:40,300
Yeah, I think next episode is pretty good.

3548
03:54:41,060 --> 03:54:48,820
So for people who thought that there were or had complaints
about the first episode, like certain things, I think we

3549
03:54:48,820 --> 03:54:50,400
improved upon it in the second episode.

3550
03:54:50,420 --> 03:54:53,680
So, yeah.

3551
03:54:54,620 --> 03:54:55,700
Cinderella, thank you.

3552
03:54:56,920 --> 03:54:59,780

Thank you again.

3554
03:55:02,340 --> 03:55:03,500

3563
03:55:21,540 --> 03:55:22,620
Can you give me a thank you?

3564
03:55:24,400 --> 03:55:30,020
Um, I never realized it was that expensive because, like, at
least four of my friends have pilot licenses for their crop

3565
03:55:30,020 --> 03:55:30,260
dusters.

3566
03:55:30,380 --> 03:55:31,080
That's crazy.

3567
03:55:32,600 --> 03:55:33,400
That's crazy.

3568
03:55:33,760 --> 03:55:36,020
Everyone had to spend so much.

3569
03:55:37,380 --> 03:55:39,220
I'm surprised people had complaints about the first episode.

3570
03:55:39,400 --> 03:55:43,360
They were, I say complaints, but it was really, like, a
constructive criticism.

3571
03:55:44,100 --> 03:55:45,400
You know, and we asked for it.

3572
03:55:45,460 --> 03:55:50,140
We said, like, please, please give us constructive criticism
since we've never done a podcast before.

3573
03:55:50,320 --> 03:55:53,420
And so, So we are looking to improve as much as we can.

3574
03:55:53,780 --> 03:55:54,620
So yeah, yeah, yeah.

3575
03:55:54,980 --> 03:55:56,160
Will there be another Patreon video?

3576
03:55:56,320 --> 03:55:57,620
Yes, there will be.

3577
03:55:57,800 --> 03:55:58,160
Yep, yep.

3578
03:55:59,040 --> 03:56:06,500
Yeah, which actually is almost the same length as the
podcast.

3579
03:56:06,880 --> 03:56:08,020
Oh my gosh, what was that gif?

3580
03:56:10,100 --> 03:56:14,860
We ended up talking so much in the Patreon video too.

3581
03:56:15,360 --> 03:56:16,560
So yeah.

3582
03:56:18,280 --> 03:56:18,800

3624
03:59:03,780 --> 03:59:05,320
Thanks for the stream.

3625
03:59:05,460 --> 03:59:06,760
Very nostalgic seeing this game again.

3626
03:59:06,840 --> 03:59:07,520

3627
03:59:07,720 --> 03:59:08,260

03:59:21,700 --> 03:59:22,900
Hypothetical lunch money.

3635
03:59:23,240 --> 03:59:24,200
I usually skip lunch.

3636
03:59:24,500 --> 03:59:26,500
But dinner funds are where I draw the line.

3637
03:59:27,040 --> 03:59:27,240
Maybe.

3638
03:59:27,580 --> 03:59:28,000
Sometimes.

3639
03:59:29,040 --> 03:59:29,500
That's okay.

3640
03:59:30,620 --> 03:59:31,340
I get it.

3641
03:59:31,460 --> 03:59:31,980
I get it.

3642
03:59:32,860 --> 03:59:33,020
Oh, wait.

3643
03:59:33,080 --> 03:59:34,100
Where did I leave off on?

3644
03:59:34,360 --> 03:59:35,040
Oh, here we go.

03:59:36,100 --> 03:59:37,140
Ria, thank you.

3646
03:59:37,660 --> 03:59:41,000
I don't have any money, but you can have the rest of this
moon pie I'm eating.

3647
03:59:41,200 --> 03:59:43,100
Why did you send that to me?

3648
03:59:45,580 --> 03:59:46,760
Mistress, thank you.

3649
03:59:47,820 --> 03:59:49,100
This game is a few years old.

3650
03:59:49,120 --> 03:59:56,940
older than me but it's really timeless even if the hardest
difficulties are so brutal thank you for the fun man i'm

04:00:05,780 --> 04:00:12,360
i've started singing snake eater during my vocal practices
because of you oh my gosh you probably sound like you're

04:00:12,360 --> 04:00:18,640

Six, thank you.

3655
04:00:23,900 --> 04:00:25,640

3656
04:00:26,040 --> 04:00:26,700
Thank you so much.

3657
04:00:27,940 --> 04:00:28,800

Cobats, thank you.

3661
04:00:34,800 --> 04:00:39,380
I was, oh, I never played Zumbini's in my childhood, but I
was so obsessed with gizmos and gadgets.

3662
04:00:39,760 --> 04:00:40,800
I never played that either.

3663
04:00:42,160 --> 04:00:45,320
I didn't play so many kids games, I think.

3664
04:00:46,700 --> 04:00:48,300
I did do a lot of Neopets, though.

3665
04:00:51,120 --> 04:00:53,900
It was amazing watching you get so excited to revisiting
this.

3666
04:00:53,980 --> 04:00:57,640
Yeah, I haven't played it since I was a kid, so it's really
awesome.

3667
04:00:58,180 --> 04:00:58,920
Israfel, thank you.

3668
04:00:59,420 --> 04:01:00,180

Airborne Ninja, thank you.

3676
04:01:17,860 --> 04:01:19,100
I got a scholarship from my local.

3677
04:01:19,120 --> 04:01:27,460
experimental aviation association to get my like wait
experimental aviation association aviation association

3678
04:01:27,460 --> 04:01:35,120
aviation association aviation association it sounds so
awesome to get my license might be something to look into it

3679
04:01:35,120 --> 04:01:40,640
would be cheaper and easier for you to get the sport pilot
license which is mainly for ultra light planes or

3680
04:01:40,640 --> 04:01:55,860
paragliders okay I'm actually going to look into that that
sounds so awesome that are all the donations thank you guys

3681
04:01:55,860 --> 04:02:04,120
thank you for sticking until the very end you didn't have to
but i appreciate it so much i hope you all have a wonderful

3682
04:02:04,120 --> 04:02:13,720
rest of your day or your night or your morning whatever um i
guess day would be appropriate there but uh i'm gonna go to

3683
04:02:13,720 --> 04:02:18,840
the store and see if that cake that i want is there So I
will see you guys on Tuesday.

3684
04:02:19,560 --> 04:02:20,000
Tuesday.

3685
04:02:21,620 --> 04:02:22,520
Rico, thank you.

3686
04:02:23,120 --> 04:02:23,800
Thank you, thank you.

3687
04:02:25,420 --> 04:02:36,160
Most of the cost of a pilot's license is renting a plane for
$150 to $250 per hour for the FAA mandated 40 hours of

3688
04:02:36,160 --> 04:02:37,260
flight time.

3689
04:02:37,600 --> 04:02:40,120
Plus however much extra time is needed to pass the check
ride.

3690
04:02:40,480 --> 04:02:42,660
If you already have access to a plane, the cost goes way
down.

3691
04:02:42,920 --> 04:02:51,940
I'm gonna talk to my old boss and see if he would actually
be willing to to teach not teach me but like maybe i can

3692
04:02:51,940 --> 04:03:04,320
shadow him and like see what goes into flying a plane i'm
gonna see oh my gosh i'm gonna become i'm gonna become a

3693
04:03:04,320 --> 04:03:18,260
pilot vtuber you want to borrow my plane is it okay can i
borrow your plane the webinars guy What do you mean by that?

3694
04:03:19,860 --> 04:03:20,820
Roshiko, thank you!

3695
04:03:20,960 --> 04:03:22,080

3697
04:03:25,440 --> 04:03:25,640
Alright.
