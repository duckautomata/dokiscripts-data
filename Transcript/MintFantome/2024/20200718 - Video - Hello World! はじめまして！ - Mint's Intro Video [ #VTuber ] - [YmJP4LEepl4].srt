00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,600
Hmm...

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,200
Yoisha!

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,920
Oh Kairi Nasaimase!

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,320
Goshujin Sama, Ojo Sama...

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,400
Hi, hello, my name is Mint Phantom.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,660
I'm a new VTuber and welcome to my channel!

7
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,500
Yeah, woohoo!

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,940
Basha, basha!

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,060
So my name is Mint, I'm Forever 19, and I am an eternal
maid.

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:32,640
So just to introduce myself, since I'm new, uh, some things
that I really like are idols, anime, horror, bubble tea, and

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
most of all, most of all, most of all, most of all, maids
and cute girls.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:45,680
My favorite foods are parfaits, ramen, and almond rice, but
I really dislike Masago and anything spicy.

13
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,960
I just, I just can't have it.

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:48,880
I'll, I'll die.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,480
I'll, I'll die again.

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,180
I'll die.

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,460
So when I'm not haunting a maid cafe, I really just like to
watch idols and anime.

18
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,560
An idol group I love in particular Kistador.

19
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,560
You should definitely go watch their music videos.

20
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,120
And for my favorite anime, recently I really love Zombieland
Saga and ReZero.

21
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,720
And I basically also have seen basically every episode of
Detective Conan.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,720
You know, when you're a ghost, you just have so much free
time on your hands.

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,340
So, I've never really been good at video games or speaking.

24
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:35,760
And so I thought, so I thought, so I becoming a VTuber would
help motivate me to get better about it and you know talk to

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:43,640
more people because I'm I'm very I'm very shy like think
think boo for Mario how he's so shy that's me don't look at

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:53,080
me look at me I want to play a lot of horror games even
though they really really do scare me I am gonna do my best

27
00:01:53,080 --> 00:02:01,120
I think maybe if everyone's there watching with me it won't
be so scary I think.

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,000
My Japanese is okay.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,800
I can try and say a little bit.

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,060
So there's a lot of things that I want to do and I hope that
I can get better with practice.

31
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,900
Please be patient with me.

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,940
with a full-time haunting and so you know it might take me
some time to get used to everything but I look forward to

33
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:46,640

the other VTuber cute girls I really do hope that I can
