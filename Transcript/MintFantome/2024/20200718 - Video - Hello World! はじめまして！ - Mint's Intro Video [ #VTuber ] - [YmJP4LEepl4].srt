MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM Hi,

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,480
Hello, my name is Mint Phantom.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,400
I am a new VTuber and welcome to my channel!

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,760
So, my name is Mint.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,240
I am forever 19, and I am an Eternal Maid.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,140
So, just to introduce myself since I am new.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:37,180
Some things that I really like are idols, anime, Horror, bubble tea, and most of all, most of all, most of all, most of all, maids and cute girls.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,180
My favorite foods are parfaits, ramen, and omurice.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,540
But I really dislike masago and anything spicy.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,920
I just, I just can't have it.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,860
I'll die.

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,460
I'll die again.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,180
I'll die.

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:51,600
I'll die.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,460
So when I'm not haunting a maid cafe, I really just like to watch idols and anime.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,700
An idol group I love in particular is Nijino Konkistadoru.

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,540
You should definitely go watch their music videos.

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,100
And for my favorite anime, recently I really love Zombieland Saga and ReZero.

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,660
And I basically also have seen basically every episode of Detective Conan.

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,780
You know when you're a ghost, you just have so much free time on your hands, so...

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,360
So I've never really been good at video games or speaking.

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:34,200
And so I thought, so I thought, so I thought, and so I thought becoming a Vtuber would help motivate me to get better about it.

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,320
And, you know, talk to more people because I'm very, I'm very shy.

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,800
Like, think, think Boo from Mario, how he's so shy.

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,840
That's me.

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,880
Don't look at me.

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,620
Look at me.

28
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,140
I want to play a lot of horror games, even though they really, really do scare me.

29
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,060
I'm gonna do my best.

30
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,640
I think maybe if everyone's there watching with me, it won't be so scary.

31
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,100
I'll try to be brave, I think.

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,980
My Japanese is okay.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,800
I can try and say a little bit.

34
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:21,060
Study a lot every day and let's talk someday, okay?

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,060
So there's a lot of things that I want to do and I hope that I can get better with practice.

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,920
Please be patient with me.

37
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,880
I'm a ghost with a full time haunting.

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,440
And so, you know, it might take me some time to get used to everything, but I look forward to talking with all of you.

39
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,480
And I really want to collab with all the other Vtuber cute girls.

40
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,100
I really do hope that I can learn a lot, though, and also collaborate with other Vtubers.

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,080
And I hope you're looking forward to my content.

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,800
So thank you so much for watching.

43
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,820
And I hope you'll follow me on Twitter and subscribe to my channel for future videos.

44
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,620
And yeah, thanks for watching.

45
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,620
I don't really know what else to say.

46
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,080
So...

47
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,240
Okay, bye.
