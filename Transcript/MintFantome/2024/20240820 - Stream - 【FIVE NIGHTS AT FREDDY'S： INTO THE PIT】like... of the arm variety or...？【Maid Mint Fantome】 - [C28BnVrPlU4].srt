1
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,640
Is this game scary?

2
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,760
For real?

3
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,400
Is this game scary for real?

4
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,600
I can't tell.

5
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,560
It's the... oh my god, this part.

6
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,260
Can you hear that?

7
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,100
It's hitting every scary beat for me.

8
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,300
Oh, hold on, let me fix some of my screen stuff.

9
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,580
Thank you for the donut!

10
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,000
Frubby?

11
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,180
No, Frubby!

12
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,080
Uh, actually, okay, I'm gonna move some stuff around on my computer.

13
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:03,700
Sorry.

14
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,400
Give me a second, guys.

15
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,660
Give me a second.

16
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,320
Put that there.

17
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,680
Put you guys here.

18
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,500
Into the armpit.

19
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,300
Into the armpit!

20
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,160
Doki barely survived?

21
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,820
No way.

22
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,340
Are you serious?

23
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,000
Only scary if you get immersed.

24
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,290
Don't be scared, Minto.

25
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,050
I'll hold your hand.

26
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,590
Don't touch me!

27
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,330
Hands off!

28
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,990
Sorry, I just woke up, so...

29
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,010
My voice is a little...

30
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,190
Cracky.

31
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,890
You're playing this in the morning.

32
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,650
Yeah, I'm playing it in the morning.

33
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,170
So true, I'm playing it in the morning!

34
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,570
Oh, hold on.

35
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,570
I need a tissue.

36
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,810
Hold on, one second.

37
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,750
Hold on, one second, one second.

38
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,110
One second, one second.

39
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,800
Good morning, Minto.

40
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,000
Good morning, Minto!

41
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,660
It's nighttime in America.

42
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,160
She's playing it in morning.

43
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,520
Um, can I eat a little bit first?

44
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,080
I was gonna eat it before I started, and then...

45
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,940
Um...

46
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,440
And then, uh...

47
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,760
I had to answer some DMs.

48
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,540
Um, I went to the konbini.

49
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,040
And it was super packed.

50
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,180
Just absolutely full of salary people.

51
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,440
And, uh...

52
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,720
Uh, oh my gosh, it was so crazy.

53
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,300
Um...

54
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,220
All I could get was a yogurt.

55
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,060
And I had to fight for that.

56
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,940
Because I had to fight my way...

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,060
...back home.

58
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,600
Back through the crowd.

59
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,100
Crowds.

60
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,180
And I got myself an onigiri.

61
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,640
And I got myself a...

62
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,960
Coal...

63
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,680
Cold corn soup.

64
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,460
It says it's delicious cold.

65
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,420
Like, it's supposed to be cold.

66
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,780
So...

67
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,040
I don't know.

68
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,760
I'll try it.

69
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,000
Here.

70
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,460
Hold on.

71
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,420
Okay.

72
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:29,500
Okay.

73
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,160
It says, actually, don't sell it hot.

74
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,920
Like, don't...

75
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,400
It's not supposed to be hot.

76
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,020
Doki might have gotten age-restricted for profanity?

77
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,480
Due to excessive hor...

78
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:44,800
Oh.

79
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,300
No way, really?

80
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,380
Okay, I'll chant...

81
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:48,680
Or...

82
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,280
Or...

83
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,620
Or...

84
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,180
Or...

85
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,240
Or...

86
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,700
No way, really?

87
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,160
I've never...

88
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,340
I don't think I've ever been...

89
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,400
Age-restricted for excessive profanity.

90
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,660
It's her first R.I.T.

91
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,060
stream.

92
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,080
No way!

93
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,380
Not a bit of M.G.'s brain rot seepin' recently.

94
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,060
My brother saw the new Alien movie before me.

95
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,000
So I texted him the next day and he said, Report.

96
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,760
Oh, I said, report, dear brother.

97
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,400
Alright.

98
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,740
Let's try some cold corn soup.

99
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:25,660
Yummy!

100
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,180
Wait, am I supposed to shake this?

101
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,580
Hold on.

102
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:29,920
Yes.

103
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,620
Okay, I'm supposed to shake it a little bit.

104
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,660
How was the new Alien movie?

105
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,880
Was it any good?

106
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,900
I think there's bits of corn in it.

107
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, so I'm gonna shake it to get the corn.

108
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,160
So good?

109
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,520
Bad?

110
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,200
Very good?

111
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,440
I heard it's okay.

112
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,880
That's my consensus right now.

113
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,440
R.L.M.

114
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:58,560
did it.

115
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,140
I didn't like it though.

116
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,860
Oh, no.

117
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,180
Sometimes, though, I don't agree with them.

118
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,500
There's a new Alien movie?

119
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah, it's like Alien...

120
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,620
Re-Re-Revolution.

121
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,400
Resurrection.

122
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,200
Revolution.

123
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,500
Re-Revel...

124
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,580
Revengeance.

125
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,140
Romulus.

126
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:25,830
Romulus.

127
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,400
Romulus.

128
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,740
Romulus.

129
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,760
I knew it started with an R.

130
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,180
Wait, what do you mean, clip show movie?

131
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,300
Yeah, I got the R right.

132
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,800
Okay, I'm not gonna continue drinking the corn soup for now.

133
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,960
But I will eat my own again.

134
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,820
Did you know that Cynthia Harrow also sang the ending theme in Castlevania Sympathy of the Night?

135
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,460
I kind of knew that.

136
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,500
But I...

137
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,100
I knew that she sang another song, like other songs for Konami.

138
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,800
But I also was like, I don't think I've heard them before.

139
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,240
So...

140
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,540
Is Ridley in the movie?

141
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,460
In the Alien movie?

142
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,600
No spoilers, though.

143
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,690
What?

144
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,910
Alina, thank you for the Akazuba!

145
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,390
Hi, Minto.

146
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,170
You didn't have to send that.

147
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,850
That was an Akazuba.

148
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,930
You could just say hi in the chat.

149
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,390
I'll hopefully see it.

150
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,370
Oh, Ridley.

151
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,110
Ridley is in Smash Bros.

152
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:51,900
Whore!

153
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,580
No!

154
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,980
Jay, why are you calling me?

155
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,420
Thank you for the Akazuba.

156
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,570
What am I eating?

157
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,570
I think I'm eating an onigiri.

158
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,650
Sorry for not saying it earlier.

159
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,030
Hello?

160
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:16,730
Hello!

161
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,990
Hi in the chat.

162
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,890
What's the flavor of onigiri?

163
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,550
It's actually chahan and egg onigiri.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,700
Oh my god.

165
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,980
I keep hearing the police sirens in the background of this.

166
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,660
I don't know if it's too quiet for you guys to hear it.

167
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,140
I keep hearing the police sirens and...

168
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,160
But it's different from police sirens in Japan, right?

169
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,760
The police sirens in Japan are like...

170
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,820
But it's still making me think.

171
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,820
I'm like, oh my gosh.

172
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,620
Is there an accident going on?

173
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,060
Like, what is happening?

174
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,480
Can I get a happy birthday in Japan?

175
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:05,800
In Japan!

176
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,700
It's my birthday and I'm hoping it'll be a nice one!

177
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,560
Thanks, Oshii!

178
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,580
Of course, John!

179
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,940
Happy birthday!

180
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,260
In Japan!

181
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,460
Happy birthday to you!

182
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,880
Happy birthday to you!

183
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,560
Happy birthday, dear John!

184
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,940
Happy birthday to you!

185
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,740
Happy birthday!

186
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,460
Oh my gosh.

187
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,420
Thank you for the pig!

188
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,360
Today's my birthday!

189
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,860
I'm glad to spend that time watching you today.

190
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,020
If I could have a birthday present, it would probably be a watch-along of Iron Eagle, a Top Gun clone that is interesting.

191
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,860
Birds of Denmark!

192
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,940
Hold on, let me write it down.

193
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,000
Iron... oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.

194
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,920
Iron Eagle watch-along.

195
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,540
We shall.

196
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,980
I mean, all we had to say was Top Gun clone.

197
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,520
Been streaming a horror game?

198
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,040
No way!

199
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,920
No way!

200
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,860
Also, good evening, Minto.

201
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,180
Good evening, Minto!

202
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,800
Wait, hold on.

203
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,620
Okay, hold on.

204
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,500
Hold on!

205
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:18,840
Wait!

206
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,960
You guys, I gotta get my stuff all back together!

207
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,100
I'm gonna have to sing you happy birthday!

208
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,220
Romulus, for vengeance, where the alien is a cyborg who will divide metallic ass.

209
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,260
Happy Birthday to you.

210
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,260
Happy Bomathay to you.

211
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,260
No, I can't remember.

212
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,520
Haya Minto.

213
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,000
I also wanna film ribbon with cool akash blue crown.

214
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,900
Oh wait, I forgot a 0.

215
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,460
No, wait.

216
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:37,860
Oh!

217
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,200
No!

218
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,400
There is more than enough, thank you!

219
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,020
Happy Birthday to you!

220
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,040
Happy birthday to you.

221
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,040
Happy Butter Prince of Denmark.

222
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,720
Happy Birthday to you.

223
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,900
I'm not done with my onigiri, but...

224
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,560
One more bite.

225
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,200
I'm feeling satisfied.

226
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,580
Are you guys ready to start the game?

227
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,920
Thank you!

228
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,060
Hello, hello, hello!

229
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,560
Hello!

230
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,090
Oh!

231
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,310
One thing!

232
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,770
Super chat's from Amelia.

233
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,230
Practically googling whatever whore is.

234
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,290
It's, it's, you know how in Freddy Fazbear, he goes, he goes...

235
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,450
He sings!

236
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,350
He goes, whore.

237
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,010
Oh, wait, I can't say it.

238
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,410
I have to go, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore.

239
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,830
And then he laughs, he goes, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore.

240
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,990
There's also...

241
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,770
There's also speedrunning in this game?

242
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,370
What's up with that?

243
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,370
There was like a thing in the settings.

244
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,010
Enable speedrun timer.

245
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,650
What is that?

246
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,900
I have it... Oh wait, I turned it on before.

247
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,580
What's the timer?

248
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,380
Okay, let's try it.

249
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,420
I'll be honest, I, um...

250
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,120
I, uh...

251
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,020
Um...

252
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,180
What's the word?

253
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,820
I saw Doki playing this, and I was just like, oh, this looks kind of interesting.

254
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,500
Maybe I'll play it myself.

255
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,980
And then I got...

256
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,920
Then I watched Fauna play it.

257
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,980
And I was...

258
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,020
I was like, no, no, no, no, I have to like...

259
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,520
But I was like so sucked in watching her play.

260
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,380
I was like, no, no, I can't spoil myself.

261
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,200
I was like, I have to...

262
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:19,280
It's like, what is the issue with being a VTuber and also wanting to watch other VTubers?

263
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,320
Because I'm just like...

264
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,880
I'm like, I want to watch a game because I'm interested.

265
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,920
I was like really getting sucked into the story.

266
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,500
But I was like, no, I want to play it now myself.

267
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,240
Speaking of speedruns, congrats on placing third on the hospital scene.

268
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,260
Thank you.

269
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,360
I'm a worldwide streamrunner now.

270
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,700
Spooky don't know for spooky ghost.

271
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,200
Spooky.

272
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,800
Let's do new game.

273
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,020
Optimal experience adjust the slider until you can barely see the center image.

274
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,760
Okay, I'm going to have it around this.

275
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,960
Because actually, it's quite bright in my room.

276
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,980
So it's hard for me to see.

277
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,220
But also, I always find it that like when I stream games, they become too dark.

278
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,440
So for your enjoyment as well.

279
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,140
If it were any darker, I wouldn't be able to see it in my room.

280
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,000
VTubers watching VTubers.

281
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,540
Nice.

282
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,240
You sure you don't mean worldwide Minto?

283
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
That's what I said.

284
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,360
Right?

285
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,860
Worldwide Minto.

286
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
What do you mean I'm not following rules?

287
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,780
Oh.

288
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,840
Creepy.

289
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,640
A narrative experience.

290
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,540
Frightening.

291
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,120
A balance.

292
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,060
I'll go with frightening.

293
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,140
Worldwide Minto.

294
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,400
Press M to...

295
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:44,540
Okay.

296
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:44,800
Oh.

297
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,280
Can't something interesting happen around here for once?

298
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,500
Oh, my head might be in the way, huh?

299
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,400
That is wild.

300
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,480
But it's time to go.

301
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,080
Whoa.

302
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh my gosh.

303
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,780
It's not just a...

304
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,240
Still.

305
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,680
He's drawing his OC.

306
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,300
Okay, hold on.

307
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,260
Let me...

308
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,700
This is the troubles of being chibi.

309
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,640
My head is too large.

310
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,080
And in charge.

311
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,560
Okay, I'll be like this if that's okay with you guys.

312
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,360
I'm like shoved into the corner.

313
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,340
Nobody puts Minto in the corner.

314
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,760
But this should be good so everybody can read.

315
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,960
Pumpkin head.

316
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,560
No!

317
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,040
Isn't there anywhere else I can go?

318
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,460
The pizza was good the first couple of times.

319
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,480
But I really want to do something new.

320
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,700
Who names their kid Oswald?

321
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,100
Sorry to any Oswalds in the chat.

322
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,620
Aw, come on, Oz.

323
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,220
Jeff's can't be the worst place to hang out.

324
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,240
Jeff's?

325
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,660
Every day has been the same all summer long.

326
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:01,000
I go in, get pizza, stare at the grease-stained yellow walls for hours, and then wait for you to pick me up.

327
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,900
This kid is so ungrateful.

328
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,580
Being able to go to like a pizza place like this every day would be a dream.

329
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,240
What the hell?

330
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,500
Where's the fun in that?

331
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,480
I'm almost glad school's starting tomorrow just so I only have to see that place on the weekends now.

332
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,540
I'm sorry, son.

333
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,680
I know no kid's only option for fun should be hanging around a rundown pizza joint.

334
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,100
But Jeff's is all we got.

335
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,460
It's all we can afford.

336
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,800
Aw.

337
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,420
Yeah, see this kid?

338
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,940
Be grateful.

339
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,900
Your dad's trying.

340
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,560
Bacon, welcome back.

341
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:41,940
Thank you.

342
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,860
Dude's eyes are glued to the road.

343
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,560
Good driver.

344
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,000
I know, right?

345
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,920
Barely blinks.

346
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,000
Actually, never mind.

347
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,840
He blinks quite a bit.

348
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,540
Stop blinking, Dad.

349
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,280
You're gonna run us off the road.

350
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,620
You know money's been tight since the mill closed.

351
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,420
Once I'm full-time at the corner store.

352
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,200
If the corner store even survives that long.

353
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,460
Everything in this town is dead or dying.

354
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,380
And there's no telling what's closing next.

355
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,680
Oh my gosh, Oswald.

356
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,040
How old are you?

357
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,300
How old are you?

358
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,380
To be thinking like this?

359
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,940
Why can't we go to the next town over where everyone else is moving?

360
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,420
All my friends are there now.

361
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,740
It can't be that hard for Grandma to travel a few miles.

362
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,800
Son, Grandma can barely lift her feet to go a few feet to the bathroom.

363
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,120
Don't be so selfish.

364
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,160
Grandma!

365
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,000
Well, unless her frail bones...

366
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,480
Wait.

367
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,320
What did I just say?

368
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,100
Unless her frail bones...

369
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,200
Strengthen overnight.

370
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,940
Moving is a no-go.

371
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,760
Her bones.

372
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,860
Her frail bones.

373
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,840
Dot, dot, dot.

374
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,980
It means laughing at osteoporosis.

375
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,400
Can't we just pack Grandma up in some bubble wrap?

376
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,540
If only it were that easy.

377
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,400
Even with the mighty strength of bubble wrap, she's still too fragile.

378
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,260
And that's not going to change.

379
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,700
Can't we just kill Grandma?

380
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,840
Speaking of things not changing.

381
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,360
I bet that opossum's still on the corner at the stoplight.

382
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,740
Oh yeah?

383
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,800
Let's make a deal.

384
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,040
If that critter's still there, I'll give you an extra buck for another slice at Jeff's.

385
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,280
Wait.

386
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,700
Like a dead opossum?

387
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:46,960
Okay.

388
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,730
Oh my god, no!

389
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,870
Still there?

390
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:56,870
Yes, still dead!

391
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,230
Get, get, get, get, get, get!

392
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,990
Why did they have to zoom in on him?

393
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,190
Things will get better, Oz.

394
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,110
Well, they can't get any worse.

395
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,610
That's the spirit.

396
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,930
Oh my god.

397
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,930
Oh, I'm blocking Oswald now!

398
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,370
Oh my god, he's such a little wimp!

399
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:28,890
What kind of a dad am I if I can't make him happy, let alone afford to feed him more than pizza?

400
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,150
Oh, Dad!

401
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,670
No!

402
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,130
You gave us an extra dollar, we're getting pizza!

403
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,270
I'm sorry things turned out this way, Oswald.

404
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,810
Oh my gosh, this is literally a Disney moment.

405
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:44,790
Where like...

406
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,030
Where, you know when you watch Disney movies as a kid and you're just like, No!

407
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,770
Ariel is right!

408
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,410
She is, she should be able to leave!

409
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,890
Her dad is in the wrong!

410
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,790
And then when you watch it as an adult and you're just like, Oh no, the dad was right!

411
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,150
Oh no!

412
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,790
The kid is awful!

413
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:05,970
No!

414
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,410
This is one of those moments where as an adult you're just like, No!

415
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,450
Oh my god!

416
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,350
Tchaikati!

417
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,230
Welcome to Memo Ship!

418
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,090
Thank you so much!

419
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,230
Oh, poor dad.

420
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,150
Well, late again, Dad.

421
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,490
Is this Oswald right here?

422
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,710
Go make friends with these guys!

423
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,450
They look nice.

424
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,460
Remember when this was the place to be?

425
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:38,960
Totally.

426
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,720
My parents took me here all the time.

427
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,000
I still remember playing in the ball pit.

428
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,740
The ball pit!

429
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,080
And getting ringworm.

430
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Wow, I don't think that's like a happy memory.

431
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,780
Random, but how was the duet of Sally and Jack?

432
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,080
It was so good!

433
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,400
It was like high energy.

434
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,900
Ew.

435
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,300
Probably why it's still roped off.

436
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,620
That and well...

437
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,500
You know.

438
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,380
I know.

439
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,480
Hmm.

440
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,840
A secret ball pit, eh?

441
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,800
Okay, Oswald.

442
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,040
Let's not...

443
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,400
They...

444
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,500
You heard ringworm and were just like...

445
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
That's what I want to be a part of.

446
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,520
Prince is absolutely destroying this grandma.

447
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,100
What are you talking about?

448
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,660
Oh my gosh!

449
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,700
Beck, happy birthday!

450
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,300
Happy birthday to you.

451
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,600
Happy birthday to you.

452
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,160
Happy birthday, dear Beck.

453
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,540
Happy birthday to you.

454
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,620
Wooo!

455
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,520
Am I gonna go to the ball pit?

456
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,460
Okay, so we lost out a move and sh...

457
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,760
Uh oh.

458
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,320
Why did we shift to run?

459
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,660
Look at this guy.

460
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,100
We're in the dining area.

461
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,500
Oh my god, my speedrun timer is going!

462
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,360
Ah!

463
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,520
Run, run, run, Oswald!

464
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,120
Wait, I want to explore though.

465
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,320
Free refills.

466
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,460
For water only.

467
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,240
Wish it was orange soda.

468
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,160
Wait!

469
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,900
Oh, I did not...

470
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,860
I did not press E.

471
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:19,740
Hello?

472
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,180
What's this?

473
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,080
It looks like today's special is a slice of pizza and a drink for $1.50.

474
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
The same as every other day.

475
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,300
You look so fed up.

476
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,800
This kid...

477
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,320
This kid is like the oldest looking child I've ever seen in my life.

478
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:37,720
I don't know.

479
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,680
There's something about him.

480
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,940
He looks like George Costanza with hair.

481
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,960
They don't even have any good flavors in there.

482
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,440
This kid is...

483
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,520
He's such a complainer.

484
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,220
Oh my gosh.

485
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,800
Wait.

486
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,300
Oh.

487
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,620
The door is locked.

488
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,740
Okay, so even if I don't press E, sometimes it still opens the...

489
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:55,980
Um...

490
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,880
And this is the exit.

491
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,280
I promised dad that I'd stay here and...

492
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,180
I'll stay here until he came to get me.

493
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,500
Kid's 14 going on 45.

494
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,540
That's what I'm saying.

495
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,000
You want another slice of cheese and a refill on the orange soda?

496
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,120
Not right now.

497
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,420
Just checking around.

498
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,240
Hey.

499
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,300
Hey.

500
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,360
Hey, Murphy.

501
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,800
Well, have fun.

502
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,380
Not much to look at other than dust bunnies and cobwebs.

503
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,780
I don't think they bite.

504
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,260
Why does everyone hate this place?

505
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,880
The dust bunnies?

506
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,060
No.

507
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,540
The wolf spiders!

508
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,460
Jeff, those definitely bite.

509
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,280
Oh.

510
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,460
Good luck, then.

511
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,080
Okay.

512
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,380
Thanks, Jeff.

513
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
The spiders.

514
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,980
Not wolf spiders.

515
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,800
Those are terrifying.

516
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,400
Is this family still here?

517
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:53,720
Oh.

518
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,940
They're gone.

519
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,420
Oh.

520
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:55,800
Just kidding.

521
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,420
They're still here.

522
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,380
Hello, family.

523
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,740
Let's not talk about that disgusting ball pit anymore.

524
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,240
Oh.

525
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,440
Look for...

526
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,260
Oh, my objective is to look for the ball pit.

527
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,480
Door is locked.

528
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,020
Employees only.

529
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,680
I don't care.

530
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,000
Door is locked.

531
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,040
Look.

532
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,360
They even have vegan pizza.

533
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,460
This place is also huge.

534
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,740
I don't know what this stage is for.

535
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,600
There's never any bands here.

536
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,260
No, no, no, no.

537
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:28,580
Let's go.

538
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:28,820
Let's go.

539
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,680
This way first.

540
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:30,740
Oh.

541
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,140
Okay.

542
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,360
Good.

543
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,500
Good.

544
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:33,820
Oh.

545
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,460
Hey.

546
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,440
It does exist.

547
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,740
It looks kind of gross, but I wonder what Dad would do if I hid and went missing for a while.

548
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,360
Maybe teach him a lesson not to leave me at such a creepy place all day.

549
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,540
Oswald.

550
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:48,840
Dad.

551
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,480
Oh.

552
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,100
What was that?

553
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:53,940
Wait.

554
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,240
What was that?

555
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,000
How do I leave?

556
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,780
Hold on.

557
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,520
I also want to see...

558
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,820
Hold on.

559
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,040
Since this is...

560
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,240
I thought...

561
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,920
I thought the ball pit would be over here, actually.

562
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,620
I've never seen Jeff use this before.

563
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,540
Explains all the stains on the floor.

564
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,160
What are these?

565
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,560
Are these bones?

566
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,300
What is this?

567
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,240
He'll go missing.

568
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:14,700
All right.

569
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,640
Locked.

570
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,320
I don't think the ball pit is in there, anyway.

571
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,140
What is he...

572
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,760
What is in there?

573
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,460
Oh.

574
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,060
The basement.

575
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,380
Okay.

576
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,740
All this stuff back here.

577
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,320
Okay.

578
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,160
All right.

579
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,020
Not much here, then.

580
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,240
Okay.

581
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,180
Time to go into the ball pit.

582
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,860
The nasty ringworm ball pit.

583
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,820
It says, do not use.

584
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,280
Why don't they just empty it?

585
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,600
Oh.

586
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,920
It looks like something got painted over here.

587
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,240
I wonder what it is.

588
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,620
Oh.

589
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,320
I can...

590
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,680
You guys can see it, right?

591
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,200
It's Freddy Fazbear.

592
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,380
Oh my gosh.

593
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,040
There's Chica.

594
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,260
Oh my God.

595
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:57,920
Oh my God.

596
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,700
The lights are...

597
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,260
Oh.

598
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,740
Oh.

599
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,290
Oh.

600
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,190
I like how the balls move.

601
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,380
I'm playing soccer.

602
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,780
Oh.

603
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,840
Kick the...

604
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,340
I got...

605
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,100
I got an achievement.

606
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,760
Kick the balls into the door frame.

607
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,980
Nice.

608
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,300
Here's hoping I don't get pink eye.

609
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,100
Oh.

610
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,080
I like the transition.

611
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,160
What the...

612
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,940
Oh.

613
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,160
Oh.

614
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,700
Oh.

615
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,120
I'm Oswald.

616
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,360
What the...

617
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,580
How's your stinky cat doing?

618
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,080
Show me your kitties.

619
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,920
They're good.

620
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,560
They're good.

621
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,780
We went to...

622
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,220
Where is this place?

623
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,620
Wait a second.

624
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,100
Wait a second.

625
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,460
Wait a darn second.

626
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,540
Oh.

627
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:30,640
Oh.

628
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:30,800
Okay.

629
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,080
I've watched Matt...

630
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,320
Pat's FNAF videos.

631
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,540
Not all of them, but probably more than I would be willing to admit.

632
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,780
And in one of the books, there was a...

633
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,560
Is this the...

634
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,640
Wasn't the ball pit a time travel ball pit?

635
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,080
Wait.

636
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,740
Is this...

637
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,740
Is this game based off the time travel ball pit?

638
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,460
No.

639
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,650
No way.

640
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:03,830
Oh.

641
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,310
Oh my gosh.

642
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,190
Look at all these children.

643
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,310
They're so happy.

644
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,010
Excited.

645
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,550
Dad says we're going to the movies later.

646
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,110
Wicked.

647
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,290
What are you saying?

648
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,010
I don't know.

649
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:15,950
Something about...

650
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,330
People...

651
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,770
Busting ghosts.

652
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,790
Can't remember the title.

653
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,570
What the...

654
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,670
Oh.

655
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,910
I saw that one last week.

656
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,390
Don't get slimed.

657
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,410
That's me.

658
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,150
He's coming.

659
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,790
He's coming.

660
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,450
The characters look like the ones I draw.

661
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,430
Wait.

662
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,770
Is Oswald a prophet?

663
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,830
He's the chosen one.

664
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,330
Why does he draw characters he doesn't even know what they are?

665
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:43,550
Go.

666
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,860
Oh my god.

667
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,500
This is such a party.

668
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,380
Yo.

669
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,180
Oh my god.

670
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,520
A brown bear.

671
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,080
A blue rabbit.

672
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,880
And some kind of bird girl.

673
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,280
Not the bird girl.

674
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,280
Creepy.

675
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,300
Oh.

676
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,280
But everyone seems to like them.

677
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,860
Oh my god.

678
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,800
Chica has got moves.

679
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,740
They all got moves.

680
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:11,600
Yeah.

681
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:11,920
Yeah.

682
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,260
Yeah.

683
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,580
Bonnie is the best.

684
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,980
Do you think he takes requests?

685
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,020
It's an animatronic.

686
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,400
Hey, Bonnie.

687
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,760
Can I program a new song into you?

688
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,000
Look at this girl right here.

689
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,420
She's dancing like she's...

690
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,400
Charlie Brown.

691
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
I love this.

692
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,320
This is so good.

693
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,120
This place is bopping.

694
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,780
I heard there's a new game in the arcade.

695
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,100
We should check it out.

696
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,040
I bet it's rad.

697
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,840
I bet I can land the highest score before anyone... before anyone else can?

698
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,940
Oh, dang it.

699
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,320
Mikey.

700
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,560
Yo, dude.

701
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,240
Rad clothes.

702
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,120
Haven't seen a getup like that before.

703
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,940
Thank you.

704
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,380
I like your Future of the Flashback shirt.

705
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,360
That's my favorite old movie.

706
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,840
Oh, that's what Oswald said.

707
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,140
Old?

708
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,300
What are you talking about?

709
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,640
That movie came out like three weeks ago.

710
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,760
Chill out.

711
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,400
He's just messing around.

712
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,720
He's Josh and a...

713
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,020
I'm Mike and that's Chip.

714
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,600
You got a name, kid?

715
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,820
I'm Oswald.

716
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,580
Oswald, like the wizard.

717
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,620
Wait, what's that a reference to?

718
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,780
Dude looks like he came from Gravity Falls.

719
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,220
Right?

720
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,640
The wizard.

721
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,480
Of Oz, of course.

722
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:48,960
Oh.

723
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,820
Wait, is his name actually Oswald?

724
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,440
Oh, yeah, I saw that one once.

725
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,300
My parents call me Oz.

726
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,380
Guess that's where they got the name from.

727
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,110
Wait, is his name actually Oswald?

728
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,530
How come we've never seen you around, Oz?

729
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,130
I'm, uh...

730
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,370
That's a good question.

731
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,770
Ha, you're a funny guy.

732
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,530
It's okay to be the new kid in town all the time.

733
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,510
The new mill is bringing in a lot of newbies like you...

734
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:29,610
Oh!

735
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,690
The new mill is bringing in a lot of newbies like you into town.

736
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,050
New?

737
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,110
Brand new steel mill.

738
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,330
My dad works there.

739
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,510
Mike's dad does too.

740
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,210
Heck, I bet that's where your dad got a job.

741
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:44,610
What?

742
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:44,910
But...

743
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,090
Chip, dude, you're stressing the newbie out.

744
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,130
Let him have some fun while he settles in.

745
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,150
You wanna play pizza roller with us, Oz?

746
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,830
Yeah.

747
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,910
That sounds fun, but I don't think I'm supposed to be here.

748
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,030
Well, where else would you be?

749
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:06,530
Wait...

750
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,130
Okay...

751
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,250
I love subtlety.

752
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,250
Come on, man.

753
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,210
I wanna talk about more movies with you.

754
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,790
It's settled then.

755
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,070
Follow us to the arcade.

756
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,150
You snoozey lose.

757
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,170
Um, I don't know what's going on, but...

758
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,830
It couldn't hurt to hang around for a while.

759
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,830
Beats hiding in that gross ball pit.

760
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,070
And who knows when dad'll show up anyway.

761
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,630
Is this the... are they gonna talk about getting pink eye, you think?

762
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,030
I need more tokens!

763
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,990
I think I lost mine in the ball pit!

764
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,670
Henrik!

765
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,010
Welcome to membership, thank you!

766
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,250
Technically, this would be Isekai, right?

767
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:54,650
No.

768
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,410
It's just time travel.

769
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,610
Because this is still the same world.

770
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,970
So it's not Isekai.

771
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,570
Just time travel.

772
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,000
It isn't time travel.

773
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,760
Just Isekai.

774
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,000
No!

775
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,340
No!

776
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:15,800
No!

777
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,860
You gotta... it's the opposite!

778
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,440
Employees only.

779
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,520
Door is locked.

780
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,200
Oh my god, the kids are going crazy.

781
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
This place is bopping.

782
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,580
William Afton, you had such a good thing going.

783
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,500
And you just threw it all away because you wanted to murder children?

784
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,380
Look how much money you were getting!

785
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,580
Pizza!

786
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:41,980
Pizza!

787
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,780
I want in on this conversation.

788
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,220
Rules for safety.

789
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:49,800
1.

790
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,580
Don't run.

791
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,320
2.

792
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,160
Don't yell.

793
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,740
We're breaking all the rules.

794
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,190
Is that kid eating macaroni and ketchup pizza?

795
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,230
Yuck.

796
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,610
Pizza snob.

797
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,090
I'm all for the evolution of pizza flavors.

798
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,410
But that's an abomination.

799
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:11,910
What?

800
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,630
I love macaroni and ketchup.

801
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,970
And then on pizza?

802
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,650
I think it'd be too much carbs.

803
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,690
But macaroni and ketchup is awesome.

804
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,750
It's one of my favorite things.

805
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,090
Clearly, you've never had pineapple pizza.

806
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:25,790
Pineapple?

807
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,110
On pizza?

808
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,010
When was pineapple on pizza invented, you guys?

809
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,290
When was pineapple on pizza invented?

810
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,270
This is what, the 70s or 80s?

811
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,790
Oh, the humanity!

812
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,530
Oh man, this is some good za!

813
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,180
I love the good za.

814
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,360
This is the good za.

815
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,080
Pizza!

816
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,520
Pizza!

817
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,880
Oh wait, this is where...

818
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,160
Oh, never mind.

819
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,960
We can't go in there.

820
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,820
We gotta go to the arcade.

821
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,020
The good za.

822
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,260
What is this?

823
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,000
Oh wait, is this where Foxy is?

824
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,780
Just Google it.

825
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,500
1962.

826
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,660
He's such a drama queen.

827
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,120
A coupon for Foxy's Piratepalooza.

828
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,460
Freddy Fazbear...

829
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,680
Oh, that vent looks...

830
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,500
Pizza-flavored soda?

831
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,140
I don't even want to begin to imagine how that tastes.

832
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,180
You could leave.

833
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,900
I should take a look around a bit.

834
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
No, no, you can end the cycle.

835
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,040
Ozzy!

836
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,400
You can end the cycle!

837
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,660
Do you think they have DDR?

838
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,580
What?

839
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,660
This arcade is huge!

840
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,840
It looks like one of those sliding puzzles.

841
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,400
Huh?

842
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,740
It says I need a game token to play.

843
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
I wonder where I could get some.

844
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,220
If I had a voucher, I could redeem it here for prizes.

845
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,720
So retro!

846
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,900
Not really big in 1985 standards, really.

847
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,760
It was so much bigger back then.

848
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,800
Wouldn't it be great to have hamburger on your pizza?

849
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,820
Just imagine it.

850
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,040
All the goodness of a hamburger.

851
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,020
But flat.

852
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,580
But why?

853
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,420
You ever try to hold a huge burger with one hand while you play one of those arcade games?

854
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,080
It's impossible.

855
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,000
All the insides fall out.

856
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,220
But you can hold...

857
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,740
Wait, but you can hold a pizza with one hand.

858
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:46,660
Huh.

859
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,780
I think you're onto something.

860
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,600
This kid is a genius.

861
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,860
Wait, you're holding...

862
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

863
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,360
He's eating that pizza slice with both hands!

864
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,920
You're ruining...

865
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,260
You're negating your point!

866
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:03,860
He's...

867
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,440
Wait!

868
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,200
But you just said that you would hold it with one hand!

869
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,720
Unless it's the burger kid that was talking.

870
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,980
Actually, now I'm not sure.

871
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,880
Wait, what was this one?

872
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,460
A bat mallet game?

873
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,380
This doesn't look as fun as the other ones.

874
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,180
Okay, Ozzy.

875
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,220
God, this guy sucks.

876
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,140
I'm sorry.

877
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,100
He's so...

878
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,000
He's so judgy.

879
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,040
Also, just let me know if the music is ever too loud or too quiet.

880
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,040
It's hard for me to gauge with this setup.

881
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,320
So, just let me know.

882
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,900
Dad said he loved this game when he was my age.

883
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,940
It does look pretty fun.

884
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,320
Wow, whoever GGY is has the top score on every game.

885
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,940
They must be really good.

886
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,100
Good.

887
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,000
God gamer.

888
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,420
Gento.

889
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,780
Says I need a game code when I play.

890
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,720
I wonder where I can get some.

891
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,080
Dad said he loved this game when he was a kid.

892
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,060
Okay.

893
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,020
Hey, friends.

894
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,740
Have you ever played Pizza Roller, Oz?

895
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,480
Gregory?

896
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,390
Wait, that's a...

897
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,150
Gregor...

898
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,030
Gregory.

899
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,190
Gregory.

900
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,650
That's a reference to Gregory!

901
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,930
Oh my god, no way.

902
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,390
Not Pizza Roller, but I've seen something like this.

903
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,990
This is the latest and greatest model from Fazbear's.

904
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,050
So I'm not surprised.

905
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,090
Pretty exclusive stuff we got here.

906
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:49,250
Who, Gregory, is the kid character in Security Breach?

907
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,170
See?

908
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,670
Security Breach, right?

909
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,030
What's Fazbear's?

910
00:40:59,310 --> 00:40:59,950
Ha!

911
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,170
A kid who doesn't know about Fazbear's?

912
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,510
You're a racket, dude.

913
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,270
Here, grab a ball and we'll show you how to play.

914
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,930
You'll go up against me first.

915
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,150
I'll go easy on you.

916
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:09,950
Maybe.

917
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:13,530
Oh.

918
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,230
Oh, okay.

919
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,670
So the goal is to score as many points as possible by rolling the balls into the bullseye ring.

920
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,910
There's a ramp on the end that's going to send your balls flying.

921
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,910
So you gotta control your speed.

922
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,910
Check this out.

923
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,170
This is not me.

924
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:36,990
Show off.

925
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,090
Give it a try, Oz.

926
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:39,970
Oh my god.

927
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:40,690
Oh, space.

928
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,210
Oh.

929
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,490
And then press.

930
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,760
Beginner's luck to you, Mike.

931
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:52,840
Bummer.

932
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,940
My turn.

933
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,300
Wait.

934
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,840
I have to beat this guy.

935
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,820
Wow.

936
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,900
You're pretty good at this, Mike.

937
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,980
No, no, no.

938
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,320
Mike's the best pizza roller player in town.

939
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,080
He's almost too good if you ask me.

940
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,700
Oh, no, no, no.

941
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,340
I have to beat him.

942
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,060
I have to beat him.

943
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,360
It's not like I try to beat.

944
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,840
I've just been stuck here all summer while my parents were.

945
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,920
But I'll get rusty once we all go back to school.

946
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,220
This music is killing me.

947
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,800
Okay.

948
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,180
Wait.

949
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,600
Here I go.

950
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,420
Oh, no.

951
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,120
I swallowed.

952
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,240
I swallowed.

953
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:29,780
Oh, man.

954
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,350
He's cheating.

955
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:34,730
School?

956
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,090
You go to Westbrook, too?

957
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,350
Well, duh.

958
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,390
Westbrook is the only school around here.

959
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,410
Okay.

960
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,870
Maybe I'll aim for 50s.

961
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,430
Oh, shoot.

962
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,230
Oh, my.

963
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:46,830
Uh-oh.

964
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:47,730
You guys.

965
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,720
Extra karaoke the other day.

966
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,300
That was awesome.

967
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:57,860
Thank you.

968
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,080
All right.

969
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:59,440
Let's.

970
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,140
Here we're going to have a new teacher this year.

971
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,660
I think her name is Miss Mee-chack.

972
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,620
Oh.

973
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,500
Last ball.

974
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,840
Make it a good roll.

975
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:14,780
Okay.

976
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,360
I can get him.

977
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,400
You're playing as Mike, right?

978
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:27,740
Me too.

979
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,720
Yes, of course.

980
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:34,960
Undefeated.

981
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,080
I hate this kid.

982
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,240
He didn't even go easy on me.

983
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,900
Dude, you didn't have to go that hard.

984
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,600
Just motivating him to try harder next time.

985
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,060
This sucks.

986
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,240
Yeah, I hope William Afton eats him.

987
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,420
How about we play some tag instead?

988
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,760
This place is a little crowded for tag.

989
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,000
That'll give us a chance to show odds around the place.

990
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,620
I say sure!

991
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,380
Rad.

992
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,640
That'll be it first.

993
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,400
Get ready to run!

994
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,720
Wait, who's it?

995
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,480
Don't get caught!

996
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,240
Wait, I'm scared!

997
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,440
The door's locked!

998
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,250
Aren't you gonna run?

999
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,150
Oh, he's it!

1000
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:33,890
Okay, sorry.

1001
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,310
My bad.

1002
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:36,670
Run!

1003
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,410
Don't get caught!

1004
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,990
I'm gonna hide in the vent.

1005
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,150
Just kidding.

1006
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:47,630
I'm gonna hide... Where's my other friend?

1007
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,110
Oh my god.

1008
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:52,870
It won't budge!

1009
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:53,370
Oh my god!

1010
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,470
Run, run, run!

1011
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:56,870
Oh, he got me.

1012
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:59,430
I love...

1013
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,650
You guys... I don't know if I'm good at this game.

1014
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:07,850
This place is packed today.

1015
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,050
I feel like I couldn't outrun you at all, Chip.

1016
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,290
I think you might be right.

1017
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,290
Everyone's getting their game on before school.

1018
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:14,370
Ooh.

1019
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,750
How about hide and seek, then?

1020
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,950
Now that's a game I'm good at.

1021
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:23,390
Here, run!

1022
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,630
Find somewhere to hide.

1023
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:27,890
Giving up?

1024
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,490
No, no, no, no.

1025
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,190
You guys aren't going either.

1026
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,410
You should start hiding.

1027
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,910
Okay, I'm gonna hide in the ball pit.

1028
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,690
I'm gonna go hide in the ball pit.

1029
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:43,590
Never mind.

1030
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,070
Oh.

1031
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,300
Wait.

1032
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,000
Oh, shit.

1033
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:50,820
Um.

1034
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,420
Wait.

1035
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,640
Don't come and get me yet.

1036
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,020
I'm hiding with the crowd!

1037
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm hiding!

1038
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,020
You can't even see me!

1039
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:02,920
You can't even see me!

1040
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,400
This is actually awesome.

1041
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:12,880
Wow!

1042
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,660
The ring taco!

1043
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,600
Thanks for the Tony gift!

1044
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,020
Does this count?

1045
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,340
Actually, I can't tell.

1046
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,160
Are they gone?

1047
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,780
Oh, they're gone.

1048
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,340
Uh-oh.

1049
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,740
I gotta find some place to hide.

1050
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,560
Oh god.

1051
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,400
Under the table?

1052
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,760
Wait, here.

1053
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,180
Maybe?

1054
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,560
Why can't I hide anywhere?

1055
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:38,470
Why can't I hide behind the counter?

1056
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:41,730
Hide... in here?

1057
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:43,490
I can't even hide anywhere!

1058
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:45,370
Wait!

1059
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,190
Hide under the bench?

1060
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:50,050
Oh my god.

1061
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:54,110
We're talking about the hamburger... hamburger again.

1062
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,390
Wait, what's in here?

1063
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,030
Oh!

1064
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:00,410
Oh.

1065
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:00,970
Oh.

1066
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:02,350
Oh my god.

1067
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:03,930
Wait!

1068
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:04,270
No!

1069
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:04,830
Oswald!

1070
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:05,750
Oswald, no!

1071
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,210
Oh, an empty suit!

1072
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,890
I bet they never check in there.

1073
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:10,750
Oh no.

1074
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,570
Hide in the suit.

1075
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:16,790
No, Ozzy.

1076
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:17,930
Ozzy, Ozzy, please.

1077
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,810
Oh, Ozzy.

1078
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,110
We're gonna get Golden Freddy'd.

1079
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,840
It's me hiding the Golden Freddy suit.

1080
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,960
June 1985?

1081
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,700
This really is just like that movie.

1082
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,420
I hear footsteps.

1083
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,160
Better hide!

1084
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:38,880
Hide!

1085
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:39,640
Oh my god.

1086
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,160
I can pan the camera.

1087
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,140
Oh!

1088
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,080
Oh my god!

1089
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,400
The meter shows how much noise you are making.

1090
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,020
Stay quiet.

1091
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,680
Wait, can I hear my mic?

1092
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,360
I hope mic didn't hear that.

1093
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,120
Gotta hide fast.

1094
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:07,840
He's going.

1095
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,380
He gets to go in the vent, but not me.

1096
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:09,760
Okay.

1097
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,280
You always hide in the vent, Chip.

1098
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,340
Nice try, but I can hear you, Chip.

1099
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:23,660
Whatever.

1100
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,960
Did you find Oz yet?

1101
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,100
Not yet.

1102
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,140
He's quiet.

1103
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,280
Unlike you.

1104
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:29,880
Well, I.

1105
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,440
Maybe I'll find it first.

1106
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,740
We're gonna get spring trapped.

1107
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:41,720
Sus.

1108
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,040
They'll never find me.

1109
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,580
Oh my god.

1110
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,040
Oh my god.

1111
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,980
Wait, is this how dark the game is?

1112
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:52,800
I can't see any...

1113
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,580
What on earth was that thing?

1114
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,560
Wait, it's so dark.

1115
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,760
Is this how dark the game is?

1116
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,120
I'm gonna have to turn up the brightness even more.

1117
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,400
I'm glad it didn't see me.

1118
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,960
Probably not supposed to be back here.

1119
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,300
What's going on?

1120
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,920
Oh, okay.

1121
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,360
Am I hearing gulping noises?

1122
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,500
Gulp, gulp.

1123
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,200
Hurry, grab the kids!

1124
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,580
The mint of 87.

1125
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:42,360
No!

1126
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,000
He's eating everybody.

1127
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,140
Hello?

1128
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,180
Hello?

1129
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,520
Anyone there?

1130
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,660
Chip?

1131
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,100
Mike?

1132
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:54,680
Uh oh.

1133
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:55,800
Crap.

1134
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,680
Yelling is useless.

1135
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,580
Too many people screaming.

1136
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,260
Where are they?

1137
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,700
Maybe they know what's going on.

1138
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,700
So I can hide in here.

1139
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,240
Ewww.

1140
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,290
Uh, this way?

1141
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,270
It won't budge.

1142
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:14,710
Oh gosh.

1143
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:16,350
Why are all the doors in this bad?

1144
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:20,330
Oh, we can play the games now.

1145
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:24,790
Oh, it won't budge.

1146
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,030
Oh my god, there's so much screaming.

1147
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,170
Okay, time for me to leave too!

1148
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:38,450
Should I just leave?

1149
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:39,650
Yes?

1150
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:41,870
Run, Oswald!

1151
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:42,890
You're so- Oh!

1152
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,140
Where do I go?

1153
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,120
What do I do?

1154
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,040
Wait, you can actually just leave?

1155
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:58,810
See you, dad!

1156
00:50:59,170 --> 00:50:59,370
Wait!

1157
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,050
No!

1158
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,580
Yay!

1159
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,420
Yay!

1160
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:41,110
Maybe?

1161
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,430
Oh, sorry.

1162
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:50,210
If you can hear...

1163
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,310
Discord.

1164
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,580
Congrats for the stream and- Congrats on another successful speedrun.

1165
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:18,830
No!

1166
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,810
Actually, I don't know how to get out of this.

1167
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:21,990
So, maybe if I- Oh, here we go.

1168
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:22,950
Skip.

1169
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:24,390
Okay.

1170
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:31,760
Hold on.

1171
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,220
Kind of important.

1172
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:43,050
Okay, wait.

1173
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,410
So now I have to- Oh gosh.

1174
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:46,510
Now I actually have to speedrun it, don't I?

1175
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:49,570
No!

1176
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:16,390
Try to continue?

1177
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:17,170
Yeah, we'll try it.

1178
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,050
Maybe it'll start where we left off, maybe.

1179
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,800
Oh, perfect!

1180
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,540
Oh, good, good, good!

1181
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,920
Okay, so don't leave!

1182
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,340
Um, what's this way?

1183
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,580
Something's blocking it.

1184
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,800
Um, what's the map here?

1185
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,900
Oh, so that's security.

1186
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:44,380
Arcade.

1187
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,200
So, he came from security, right?

1188
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,020
Okay, uh, shows us what is- Okay, the party hallway.

1189
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,460
We can go down through there.

1190
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,320
Cool.

1191
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,580
Back to the gold lane.

1192
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,240
Oh wait, it won't budge!

1193
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,240
Just kidding.

1194
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,280
Okay, now it's also blocked off.

1195
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,920
Why is the dining area blocked off?

1196
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:06,920
Like, that doesn't make any sense.

1197
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,680
Go!

1198
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,420
Run,

1199
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:22,150
children, run!

1200
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:24,670
Okay.

1201
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:28,450
Here we go.

1202
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,510
Go!

1203
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:30,090
Go!

1204
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:31,550
Oh my god, I'm gonna get trampled!

1205
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:33,930
What's this?

1206
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:38,230
Science has gone a pirate in senior- soon!

1207
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,910
No idea what that means, but definitely not checking behind this curtain.

1208
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,790
Why couldn't I read that before?

1209
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,050
Oh, I can hide here, too.

1210
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:47,310
Okay, good to know.

1211
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,890
Wait, how do I leave?

1212
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:49,110
Okay.

1213
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:50,330
Go!

1214
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:50,750
Go!

1215
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:52,050
Go!

1216
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:52,470
Go!

1217
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,990
This kid has no survival instincts whatsoever!

1218
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:07,110
So we can't go to the party hallway, for some reason.

1219
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,550
We can't go to the kitchen.

1220
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:10,870
We can go to the ball pit.

1221
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:17,590
Is this what everybody's freaking out about?

1222
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:18,610
They look so normal!

1223
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:20,970
I can't go backstage.

1224
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:22,310
Look at them!

1225
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,210
We're still partying, everybody!

1226
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:25,250
The party's still here!

1227
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,480
Dang, this is a good time!

1228
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:36,680
Oh!

1229
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,240
Where are my friends?

1230
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,720
I should look for Chip and Mike.

1231
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,620
I am!

1232
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,060
But where the heck are they?

1233
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,940
Some kind of mural.

1234
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,140
What weird characters.

1235
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:55,940
Are they under here?

1236
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,580
I'm so dedicated to my friends!

1237
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,900
Door is locked.

1238
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:08,700
Oh!

1239
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:09,580
We can go through here!

1240
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:27,230
Wow!

1241
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,950
Is it asking me to follow it?

1242
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:30,410
Maybe it has Chip and Mike.

1243
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,910
Wait, is that his...

1244
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:36,930
Follow the creature.

1245
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,290
I can't run in here anymore.

1246
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:42,230
Won't let me.

1247
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,940
There's no way someone ate two pizzas while running out of here.

1248
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:49,500
Creepy.

1249
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,740
That's your concern?

1250
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,500
He was beckoning me.

1251
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,560
He was like, come on.

1252
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,680
Come here, little eyeswold.

1253
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,900
I wanna show you a secret.

1254
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,580
Oh, this is confusing.

1255
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,520
Okay, so this is investigate, but this is to crawl under.

1256
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,460
That's gonna mess me up in the future.

1257
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,120
I know it.

1258
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,580
Sorry if you can still hear Matara messaging me.

1259
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:15,320
I don't know why sometimes...

1260
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:16,760
Uh...

1261
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:19,680
Sorry.

1262
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,480
Oh my god.

1263
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,500
Turn off all notifications for Discord.

1264
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:23,960
There we go.

1265
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:24,880
Oh my god!

1266
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,740
It didn't even work!

1267
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:29,980
It didn't even work.

1268
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:34,480
Usually when I have OBS on it, like...

1269
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,080
It mutes everything, so I'm confused.

1270
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:39,340
Oh!

1271
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:39,420
Oh!

1272
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,860
I think I need to run away.

1273
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,100
I think I need to hide.

1274
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,680
I think I need to hide!

1275
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:51,980
Eek!

1276
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,540
What is this?

1277
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,400
What's going on?

1278
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,880
What is he saying?

1279
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,860
Ew, you can hear like the...

1280
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,920
The gasp, the air, the breathing.

1281
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,040
Is it gone?

1282
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,340
I gotta get out of here.

1283
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,620
I hope Chip and Mike are okay.

1284
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,680
What is this spam?

1285
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,160
Thank you, Dr. Seuss.

1286
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,080
Thank you, Dr. Seuss.

1287
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:46,940
What is this spam?

1288
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,640
That was so funny.

1289
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:54,780
I gotta get out of here.

1290
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,820
I hope Chip and Mike are okay.

1291
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,280
I mean, I know that they're like your little time travel buddies.

1292
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,920
But like you just met these kids.

1293
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,100
I think it's a little dramatic.

1294
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,300
I'm 13 and that's deep.

1295
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,180
I'm 13 and that's deep.

1296
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:14,780
Oh!

1297
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,040
I think I just heard him come back.

1298
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:24,420
I hear him.

1299
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,360
I hear him walking around.

1300
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,300
Wait, where is he?

1301
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,340
Oh, this is scary!

1302
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,900
I can hear him walking around though!

1303
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:39,820
Did you guys hear that?

1304
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,880
Okay, the only objective is escape.

1305
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,240
So, um...

1306
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,500
I guess we forgot about our friends.

1307
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,780
I guess we don't care about them.

1308
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,870
The door is locked.

1309
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:00,690
Where is that to?

1310
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:01,830
Oh, okay.

1311
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:02,710
That's the arcade.

1312
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:04,110
Oh, what is this?

1313
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:06,290
Um...

1314
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:07,430
What?

1315
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:09,930
It's the possum!

1316
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:11,910
That's so messed up.

1317
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,190
Quest, I need to get out.

1318
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:19,750
Why do we have this fan art of me with these two kids that I just met?

1319
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:21,470
We look like we've been friends.

1320
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:21,890
Hold on.

1321
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:25,530
We look like we've been friends since the womb.

1322
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:27,790
I just met these guys!

1323
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:30,570
Like literally 15 minutes ago.

1324
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:32,070
This is ridiculous.

1325
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:35,290
I think Oswald has some attachment issues or something.

1326
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:36,470
I think Oswald has some attachment issues or something.

1327
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:37,750
Like buddy.

1328
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:41,650
I can hide in here, right?

1329
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:42,750
Oh, I can't hide in there.

1330
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:45,910
What is this room again?

1331
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,410
Oh, the party room.

1332
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:49,190
I wanna see what's in here though.

1333
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:50,130
It won't let me go in.

1334
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,490
For some reason, it won't let me go in.

1335
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,070
And this room is...

1336
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:57,310
Sorry, I'm just trying to get my bearings.

1337
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:58,530
But it's...

1338
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:00,510
It's locked.

1339
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:03,790
And then this room is...

1340
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,910
Oh, it won't budge.

1341
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,610
That room is the kitchen.

1342
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:09,350
So we can't go into the kitchen.

1343
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:10,870
At all.

1344
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,750
I've known them for 15 minutes.

1345
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:17,510
And if anything has happened to them...

1346
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,080
Oh shit.

1347
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,060
Oh wait.

1348
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:27,340
In here!

1349
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:27,380
In here!

1350
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:29,840
Bump it!

1351
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:30,220
Bump it!

1352
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:30,580
Bump it!

1353
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:39,260
Oh my god.

1354
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,840
There he is!

1355
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,520
Oh my god.

1356
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:45,340
Dad!

1357
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,520
Oswald, what were you thinking?

1358
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,000
Hiding in that nasty old thing?

1359
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,520
Didn't you hear me calling you?

1360
01:01:57,770 --> 01:01:58,490
Oh no!

1361
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:03,990
Oh my god, no!

1362
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:05,630
He got my dad.

1363
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,210
He got my...

1364
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:09,110
Oh.

1365
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:12,890
Eeeeee!

1366
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:15,750
Eeeeee!

1367
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:16,730
Oh, we got him!

1368
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:17,870
Oh my god, we saved my dad.

1369
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:21,670
Dad, are you okay?

1370
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:23,650
Oh, I thought he was gonna like...

1371
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:24,550
I was gonna have to go back.

1372
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:25,690
Uh oh.

1373
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:26,790
I don't think dad is okay.

1374
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,230
Dad, are you okay?

1375
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,870
Oh my god, my dad's been possessed.

1376
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:34,470
Oh my god, my dad...

1377
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:35,690
Do you...

1378
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:36,970
Do you say...

1379
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:40,170
Have a good night, guys.

1380
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:44,190
Have a good night, guys.

1381
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:46,350
Wait, Jeff, I think something's wrong with my dad!

1382
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,310
He looks fine to me.

1383
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,130
The dust probably got to your head, kid.

1384
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:55,110
Go home and relax.

1385
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:58,030
Wait!

1386
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:05,690
We're just vanity contacts?

1387
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:06,810
Yeah, obviously.

1388
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,090
Night one, Oswald's house.

1389
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:12,610
The longer Oswald runs, the higher chance he'll run and trip.

1390
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:13,330
Wait, really?

1391
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:17,410
What did you do to my dad?

1392
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:18,850
Where are you taking me?

1393
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:21,090
Oh, his eyes glow.

1394
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:21,890
It's so freaky.

1395
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:23,910
How do you even know how to drive?

1396
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,470
How do you even know how to drive?

1397
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:29,390
I mean, he was an adult.

1398
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,430
William Afton was an adult.

1399
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:37,710
Oh my god!

1400
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:39,470
Springtrap in the wheel!

1401
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:41,610
My house!

1402
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:42,790
How do you know where I live?

1403
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:47,990
Oh my god, he tripped.

1404
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:51,730
This is so funny.

1405
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:52,410
I'm sorry.

1406
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:54,610
Oh my god, we have a cat!

1407
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:58,530
Ooh, the cat does not like him.

1408
01:03:59,370 --> 01:03:59,850
I...

1409
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,110
I'll just be going to my room for the night now, okay?

1410
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:05,970
I'll just be going to my room for the night now, okay?

1411
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:07,030
Sleepover with Springtrap!

1412
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:07,950
Oh my god!

1413
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:12,350
This is so funny.

1414
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:14,350
Okay, good night, dad!

1415
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:17,670
What's happening?

1416
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:18,370
What should I do?

1417
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:21,170
Oh my god, please!

1418
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:26,070
Why is everybody in the world trying to message me?

1419
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:27,230
Why is everybody in the world trying to message me?

1420
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:27,390
Why is everybody in the world trying to message me?

1421
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,130
Please!

1422
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,120
I'm gonna exit.

1423
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,520
Out of Discord.

1424
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,800
Just close out.

1425
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:38,980
Quit Discord.

1426
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:39,780
There we go.

1427
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,280
I'm so sorry.

1428
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:49,780
That always gets me too when I'm like watching a stream and someone... you hear Discord or you hear something and I'm like Oh, you hear Windows?

1429
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,100
I always think it's my Windows.

1430
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:53,520
What's happening?

1431
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,220
What should I do?

1432
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,120
Oh, that's my Windows.

1433
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,660
I wasn't in the game.

1434
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:01,220
Oh, I'll call mom!

1435
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,520
Maybe she'll know what to do.

1436
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,100
Dad always leaves his cell phone at home.

1437
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,100
I bet it's in his room.

1438
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,160
Okay.

1439
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:10,520
Call mom!

1440
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:11,660
Okay.

1441
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:13,980
Uh oh.

1442
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:16,140
Why can I hide under my bed?

1443
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,780
Why can I do that?

1444
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,340
Why do I have so many pictures of Freddy and stuff?

1445
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,780
I'm obsessed with these characters!

1446
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:26,740
I don't even know who they are!

1447
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,660
ViviCore things are the gifted!

1448
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,300
Won't need this fan now that summer's over.

1449
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,160
I mean, just because summer's over doesn't mean it's not gonna be hot anymore.

1450
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:37,300
You're silly.

1451
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,720
How far do we have to run to trip?

1452
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,640
How far do we have to run to trip?

1453
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:44,900
How far do we have to run to trip?

1454
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:45,780
I wonder.

1455
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,340
Freddy and Godzilla.

1456
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,740
Yeah, we got Godzilla right there.

1457
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,540
We have whatever this is.

1458
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,640
Dad got me this lava lamp from a yard sale.

1459
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,520
Pretty retro.

1460
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:56,840
But I thought it was cool.

1461
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:58,600
Okay.

1462
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,540
I've got more important things to do than homework.

1463
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:05,140
Okay.

1464
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:06,000
So true, kids.

1465
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,640
Is this the way we leave?

1466
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,160
This is my room.

1467
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:12,540
Okay.

1468
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,900
This is Dad's room.

1469
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,340
This is the living room?

1470
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,560
Dad's room.

1471
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:21,400
Dad's room?

1472
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,700
Wait, this is...

1473
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,040
Why am I going to the attic when he's Oswald?

1474
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:27,440
Oswald?

1475
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,440
This is not where I wanted you to go.

1476
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,320
Mom used to rock me to sleep on this when I was a baby.

1477
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:34,920
Freddy and Godzilla.

1478
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:35,840
The two genders.

1479
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,320
What are we doing up here?

1480
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,720
Looks like there's a battery that got left inside.

1481
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:43,880
Might as well take it with me.

1482
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:44,900
Okay.

1483
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,460
And we can hide in this trunk?

1484
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,400
Oh my god.

1485
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,240
The way he like...

1486
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:51,800
dove in there.

1487
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,440
He like so smoothly goes in and out.

1488
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,200
This looks like it'll make a lot of noise.

1489
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:03,720
Okay.

1490
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,180
Is he closer when I hear the whispers?

1491
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,300
Can't tell.

1492
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,100
He won't come up here, right?

1493
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:22,590
Yeah, I'm on night one.

1494
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:26,010
Wait, are there five nights?

1495
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:29,710
I'm scared.

1496
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:36,570
Can I hide in the closet?

1497
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:37,470
Okay, I can.

1498
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:39,270
So many numbers.

1499
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:40,270
This must be a phone book.

1500
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:41,250
Okay.

1501
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:44,880
Alright.

1502
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:45,640
Alright.

1503
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,200
Master bedroom.

1504
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,480
I went to the opposite way.

1505
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:52,940
Okay.

1506
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:55,100
Wait, what is this room?

1507
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:55,940
Hallway one.

1508
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,820
Doesn't really look like a hallway, but okay.

1509
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,420
I'm scared.

1510
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,880
I don't hear him though.

1511
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:11,660
Oh.

1512
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:12,080
Oh my god.

1513
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,080
Um.

1514
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:15,760
Sorry.

1515
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:21,280
He let the man sleep.

1516
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:29,160
I saw dad's phone on the nightstand, but I need to find a way to make that thing leave first.

1517
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,420
Maybe I can startle it with a loud noise.

1518
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:32,760
Okay.

1519
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:35,220
Um.

1520
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,600
There was the...

1521
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,580
The little doll, right?

1522
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:46,700
Who's laughing?

1523
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,820
Who's the children laughing in my house?

1524
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:53,120
Okay.

1525
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:53,480
Let's see.

1526
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:53,680
What?

1527
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:54,740
Actually, I'm curious.

1528
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:55,480
What's the date?

1529
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,760
Wait, what's under the table?

1530
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,400
Why is the table moving?

1531
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,920
The year is still the same.

1532
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:03,580
Thanks, calendar.

1533
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:08,160
We keep the board games we play for family fun night here.

1534
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,600
We used to go out but now we just play board games at home.

1535
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,800
What's wrong with that?

1536
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:12,460
Oswald!

1537
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,520
You are so ungrateful!

1538
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,300
Is there anything under here?

1539
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:19,780
Is there anything under here?

1540
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:20,400
Is there anything under here?

1541
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,780
It's just a breezy table?

1542
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:32,500
I can't tell if this is ambience or if something's coming.

1543
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:34,840
Let's just hide.

1544
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,200
Is something coming?

1545
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,260
I guess so.

1546
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,180
Maybe the current year.

1547
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:42,720
Oh, maybe.

1548
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:50,840
I think it's just ambience.

1549
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,580
Oh, we could startle him.

1550
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,140
Okay, hold on.

1551
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:00,480
If we startle him with the radio then he'll come out, right?

1552
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:04,600
And then we could just loop back through.

1553
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:09,430
I wonder if it changes...

1554
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:10,250
Oh, see, this.

1555
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:11,830
Which way will he come?

1556
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:14,410
I wonder if it changes...

1557
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:15,810
It probably doesn't change the current month.

1558
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,430
But it just came out, this game, right?

1559
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:19,050
So it wouldn't make sense that it says August.

1560
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:22,250
Okay.

1561
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:24,930
I don't know which way he'll come through, though.

1562
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:25,910
The kitchen?

1563
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,630
Maybe we go up hallway one.

1564
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:32,270
Oh, my bad.

1565
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:11,210
Open phone!

1566
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:14,770
With the saddest, most out-of-date model imaginable.

1567
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:15,790
I hate Oswald.

1568
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:16,730
He sucks so much.

1569
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:18,050
What are the numbers?

1570
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,190
Does dad seriously just remember them all?

1571
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:21,090
Oh, my God.

1572
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:22,230
What are the numbers?

1573
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:24,570
What are the numbers?

1574
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,630
Mom's numbers should be written somewhere in the house.

1575
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:29,170
Okay, we saw the phone book.

1576
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:30,710
Uh...

1577
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:32,490
Close.

1578
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:33,750
Oh, my God.

1579
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:34,250
Oh, my God.

1580
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:35,250
I have to get out of here.

1581
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:35,930
I'm scared.

1582
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:37,390
Run.

1583
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:40,490
God, I'm scared.

1584
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:41,190
I'm scared.

1585
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:42,990
Hide under the bed.

1586
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:49,430
Oh, my God.

1587
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,140
Oh, my God.

1588
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:03,190
Can't tell where he is.

1589
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:05,630
Did he go back to the bedroom?

1590
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,000
You think he went back to the bedroom?

1591
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:15,440
Okay.

1592
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,240
Wait.

1593
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,760
I is inventory, right?

1594
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:18,520
E is inspect.

1595
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,820
Can I call 911?

1596
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:21,740
9?

1597
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:25,560
911.

1598
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:29,600
Oh.

1599
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,500
I maximized the noise meter.

1600
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:37,880
Unfortunately, 911 services have been suspended in your area for budgetary reasons.

1601
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,020
If this is an emergency, please call your local police station.

1602
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,740
We're sorry for any inconvenience.

1603
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:45,660
Have a nice day.

1604
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,560
I hear you.

1605
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,820
Why does it say I hear you?

1606
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,000
Who you gonna call?

1607
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:56,320
Well, that's great.

1608
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:57,680
Wait.

1609
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,520
Is he gonna come in here?

1610
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,080
Did he hear me?

1611
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,740
Is that legal?

1612
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:04,360
I don't even think that's legal, right?

1613
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:08,800
Is he gonna come in here?

1614
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:09,700
Did he hear me?

1615
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,520
Did he hear me?

1616
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,700
Did he?

1617
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:33,230
Oh my god.

1618
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:35,070
Seeing his shadow opening the door.

1619
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:37,290
That was freaky.

1620
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:39,930
That was so freaky.

1621
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:41,790
Okay.

1622
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:44,830
So it was just hallway 1.

1623
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:47,550
That had the phone books in it, right?

1624
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:51,530
Can you actually call the Ghost Bumper... Bumper?

1625
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,930
Ghost Busters number?

1626
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:56,710
The Ghost Bumbers.

1627
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:00,170
I don't know.

1628
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:02,070
What's the Ghost Busters number?

1629
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:09,270
Oh, sorry.

1630
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,190
If you hear that, that's my alarm to wake up.

1631
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:14,630
Everything is making noise today.

1632
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:16,410
I'm a little freaked out.

1633
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:20,010
Okay.

1634
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:21,490
Alright.

1635
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:21,930
Here we go.

1636
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,320
Wait.

1637
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,100
Was that him?

1638
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,700
Was that my door or his door?

1639
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:43,220
Oh, he's coming.

1640
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:43,540
He's coming.

1641
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:43,860
He's coming.

1642
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,460
He's walking around.

1643
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:46,900
I hear him.

1644
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:54,110
Oh, I think he's in the dining room?

1645
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:57,330
Oh my god.

1646
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:58,550
Yeah!

1647
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:03,890
Alright.

1648
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,620
How do you hear that?

1649
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,400
Remember how I said it's hard for me to judge if the...

1650
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:15,520
if...

1651
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,360
the volume is too loud or not?

1652
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:20,760
Because for me, it's so loud.

1653
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,740
Plumbing, 555, 325, mechanic.

1654
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:23,680
Okay.

1655
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,280
Do these numbers work?

1656
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:26,980
That is...

1657
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,340
Did he really put his wife in as plumbing?

1658
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,400
555, 325.

1659
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:33,900
555, 325.

1660
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:37,740
Wait.

1661
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,180
555, 325.

1662
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:47,500
Wife?

1663
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,020
You've reached your friendly neighborhood plumber.

1664
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:56,820
What's leaking?

1665
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,480
Can you help me?

1666
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:00,340
It's my dad.

1667
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:01,500
Say no more.

1668
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,820
Your old man tried to fix the pipes and made it worse, huh?

1669
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,700
Well, have him give me a call and I can fix it, kid.

1670
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,340
Sounds good?

1671
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,880
Wait, it's not...

1672
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,660
I think he's gonna come in here.

1673
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,300
I think he's gonna hear me.

1674
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,440
My dad is leaking.

1675
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:18,940
Yeah, it's not me.

1676
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:19,880
It's my dad.

1677
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:22,340
Um...

1678
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,960
Okay, so that phone book didn't work.

1679
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,840
Where else...

1680
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:33,460
would it be?

1681
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:36,780
Hmm...

1682
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,500
Is this game canon?

1683
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:40,400
I think technically.

1684
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,220
I think the books are canon, right?

1685
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,300
But FNAF lore is...

1686
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,700
Okay, he's in the dining room.

1687
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:47,600
No, sorry.

1688
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,780
He's in... Now...

1689
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:49,840
He was in the living room.

1690
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:50,820
Now he's in the dining room.

1691
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:56,220
But yeah, it's very loud for me, so I can hear, like, the footsteps.

1692
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:57,600
I mean, I can...

1693
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,060
I can turn it up for you guys if you want.

1694
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:06,810
Where...

1695
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:07,590
Where would it be?

1696
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,010
Oh, there's our AU.

1697
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:15,810
Oh, really?

1698
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:16,350
Okay, okay.

1699
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:21,770
My model blocks the noise meter here.

1700
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:22,570
Let's see.

1701
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:25,130
Where can I put myself?

1702
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:27,430
Maybe I have to be over...

1703
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:29,190
My head is too big!

1704
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:30,830
Maybe I just have to be really small.

1705
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:36,450
Yeah, I'll hang out here with you guys up here, okay?

1706
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:38,890
I'll be kinda small, though.

1707
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:44,150
There we go.

1708
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:45,390
This should be alright.

1709
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:46,990
To not block anything.

1710
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:48,330
There's so much...

1711
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,670
There's so much on this interface, you know?

1712
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:53,190
So I don't wanna block anything.

1713
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:53,830
Okay.

1714
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:00,910
Let's see.

1715
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:02,310
We haven't gone into the kitchen.

1716
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:03,690
We haven't gone into the basement.

1717
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:06,350
I don't think it would be in the attic.

1718
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:08,470
We didn't see anything.

1719
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:09,710
We saw the doll up there.

1720
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:11,290
Um...

1721
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:12,530
Now, where is he?

1722
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,700
I don't hear him.

1723
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,140
In here, maybe?

1724
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:34,800
Wait, where's the place to hide?

1725
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,460
Oh, that turns that on?

1726
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:37,840
Okay...

1727
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:38,920
Oh, God.

1728
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,040
There's nowhere to hide in here.

1729
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:42,900
Wait, there's nowhere to hide in here.

1730
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:45,740
There's a picture of Grandma on the...

1731
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:46,440
Oh, my God.

1732
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:46,720
The cat.

1733
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:47,320
Oh, my God.

1734
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,100
There's a picture of Grandma on the shelf.

1735
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:49,820
She still lives nearby.

1736
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,260
Wait, can I go to Grandma?

1737
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:56,680
I don't want Mom coming home to that thing alone.

1738
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:01,400
I hope nothing happens to the cat, you guys.

1739
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:02,900
Does anything happen to the cat?

1740
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:05,500
Please, cat.

1741
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:07,820
I gotta figure out how to save Dad.

1742
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:09,420
Oh, shit.

1743
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,320
There's nowhere to hide in here.

1744
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,070
Okay, the cat's okay.

1745
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:22,690
Thank you.

1746
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:23,510
Shit.

1747
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:23,830
Oh, shit.

1748
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:24,030
Oh, shit.

1749
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:30,390
Oh, they give you a little bit of a warning before he comes in, which is really nice.

1750
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:40,130
Oh, my God.

1751
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:45,790
His breathing is so scary.

1752
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:48,170
Why does it look like Springtrap now?

1753
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:49,530
That was my question.

1754
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,570
He went into the kitchen.

1755
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:51,990
Okay.

1756
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:53,290
Okay.

1757
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,950
I'm gonna give him a second to get out of the kitchen so we can check in there.

1758
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:06,980
I think we're okay.

1759
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:15,870
What the hell is that sound?

1760
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:18,650
Oh, shit.

1761
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:19,030
Oh, shit.

1762
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:19,730
Wait.

1763
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:21,570
Is he coming?

1764
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:26,170
What's all this yelling?

1765
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:32,750
He may be whiny, but Oz is really damn loyal.

1766
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:34,290
You know what?

1767
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:37,250
True.

1768
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:37,930
You're right.

1769
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:39,770
That is so true.

1770
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:47,670
Oh, my God.

1771
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:48,130
Oh, my God.

1772
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,050
Oh, my God.

1773
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,050
Oh, my God.

1774
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:51,070
Oh, my God.

1775
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:51,070
Oh, my God.

1776
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:51,170
Holy cow.

1777
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,000
Oh, jeez.

1778
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:06,300
Oh, jeez.

1779
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:12,920
Hold on.

1780
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:14,740
I'm gonna eat a cough drop.

1781
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,500
I have some stuff I need to record later, so I don't want my...

1782
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,040
Okay.

1783
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:19,900
Now we go.

1784
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:22,020
Actually, wait.

1785
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:22,640
Where did he go?

1786
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:23,860
Hold on.

1787
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:24,280
Wait.

1788
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,240
Where did he go?

1789
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,240
Did he go to the...

1790
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:27,740
To the...

1791
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,620
Did he go to the hallway or to the living room?

1792
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:34,420
Because if he went to the... He entered...

1793
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,380
He went left.

1794
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:37,780
Okay.

1795
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:39,020
Which means he'll come back.

1796
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:40,280
Hmm.

1797
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,780
Do you think he'll go to the kitchen though?

1798
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,120
No, we don't have time.

1799
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,300
He's coming back already.

1800
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:51,680
Oh, my God.

1801
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,320
He's going so fast.

1802
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,220
Don't go to the kitchen, you son of a gun.

1803
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:57,420
Oh, my God.

1804
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:57,820
Please.

1805
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,280
You're camping.

1806
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:01,920
Oh, wait.

1807
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:02,040
Wait.

1808
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:02,520
This is good.

1809
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:02,880
This is good.

1810
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:05,320
Yeah.

1811
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:05,560
Yeah.

1812
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:05,680
Yeah.

1813
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:05,960
Go.

1814
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:06,220
Go.

1815
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:06,360
Go.

1816
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:06,480
Go.

1817
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:06,620
Go.

1818
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:09,520
Okay.

1819
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:09,880
Nice.

1820
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:20,330
Do you need food?

1821
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:20,890
Are you hungry?

1822
01:22:23,690 --> 01:22:24,090
Oh, shit.

1823
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:24,270
Shit.

1824
01:22:24,290 --> 01:22:24,390
Shit.

1825
01:22:24,410 --> 01:22:24,530
Go.

1826
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:24,730
Go.

1827
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:24,890
Go.

1828
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:25,030
Go.

1829
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:26,930
Go to the basement.

1830
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:29,450
These dusty old boxes.

1831
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:31,070
They've been down here for as long as I can remember.

1832
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,430
I got a...

1833
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:35,670
Can I hide in here?

1834
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:37,310
I got... Wait.

1835
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:38,070
What am I getting?

1836
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:39,130
What is all this stuff?

1837
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:41,790
What is all this stuff I'm collecting?

1838
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:44,590
I'm scared.

1839
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:46,550
I hear mice.

1840
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:49,510
Okay.

1841
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:51,770
What am I trying to do?

1842
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:54,990
Trying to find my mom's number.

1843
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:59,310
But I don't know where it is.

1844
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:05,460
Post-its on the fridge.

1845
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:06,320
Okay.

1846
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:06,600
Hold on.

1847
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,420
I'm just seeing if I can hear him.

1848
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:09,760
I don't think...

1849
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,140
I don't think I can.

1850
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,060
Check my inventory.

1851
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:15,780
No.

1852
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:16,980
It doesn't have it.

1853
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:18,280
Oh my god.

1854
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,680
I didn't mean to do that, but whatever.

1855
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:20,700
Okay.

1856
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:23,640
Squeak.

1857
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:23,940
Squeak.

1858
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:24,240
Squeak.

1859
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:28,580
Oopsie.

1860
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,180
Don't come in here.

1861
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:38,630
Do you guys remember the other number?

1862
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:43,050
Oh my god.

1863
01:23:43,070 --> 01:23:43,410
The cat.

1864
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:45,410
So cute.

1865
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:47,410
Do you guys remember the other number?

1866
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:48,130
Ugh.

1867
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:50,750
I don't remember it.

1868
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:53,130
There's a contact list option.

1869
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:54,970
Oh!

1870
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:57,550
Oh, that's only the ones that I've called though.

1871
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:00,790
It's only the ones that I've called though.

1872
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:02,350
Hmm.

1873
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:06,570
Hmm.

1874
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:13,440
140.15.

1875
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:15,600
140.85.

1876
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:18,100
Colonel.

1877
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:19,220
Okay.

1878
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:19,980
Maybe we're good.

1879
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:27,170
Don't be in here, sir.

1880
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,530
Oh, you can turn the lights on and off.

1881
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:32,830
It makes a little bit of noise.

1882
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:38,440
Is there anywhere to hide in here?

1883
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:39,660
Let's check the post-it.

1884
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,320
Oh shit.

1885
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,060
Wait.

1886
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:49,660
Please don't.

1887
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,520
Take it.

1888
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:51,860
Stop.

1889
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:52,780
I was so close.

1890
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:04,940
This house is...

1891
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:07,640
moderately sized.

1892
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,020
You can go to any room you'd like, Springtrap.

1893
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:11,380
Please.

1894
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:14,280
My name is one letter from Bustin.

1895
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,120
How do you feel about that, Austin?

1896
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,940
How do you feel about that information?

1897
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:24,220
How do you feel about that, Austin?

1898
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:24,920
Are you going for a speedrun?

1899
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,740
No, I just thought it was funny to have on.

1900
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:30,160
Okay.

1901
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:33,460
I can't...

1902
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:36,040
Oh, the ambiance is too loud for me to hear his footsteps.

1903
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,080
But maybe we're good.

1904
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:40,720
Sorry.

1905
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:46,970
Please don't be there.

1906
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:51,030
Okay.

1907
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:56,550
Oh god.

1908
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:57,750
I almost knocked over my mic.

1909
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,140
Oh god.

1910
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:02,140
I almost knocked over my mic.

1911
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:02,240
Is this the bridge?

1912
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:04,500
This is Mom's number.

1913
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:05,440
Okay.

1914
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:11,900
Meow, meow, meow.

1915
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:14,100
I love the cat.

1916
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:16,580
Okay, we're going to hide in here.

1917
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,780
And we're going to call.

1918
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:21,560
Mom's number.

1919
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,320
555-5683.

1920
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:31,920
555-5683.

1921
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,280
555-5683.

1922
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:35,280
555-5683.

1923
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:41,240
555-5683.

1924
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:41,540
555-5683.

1925
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,000
555-5683.

1926
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:43,160
555-5683.

1927
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,440
555-5683.

1928
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,540
555-5683.

1929
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:50,560
Hello?

1930
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:52,520
Mom!

1931
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:52,980
Mom!

1932
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:53,540
It's an emergency!

1933
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:55,680
What's going on?

1934
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:58,140
It's sad!

1935
01:26:58,260 --> 01:26:58,520
He's...

1936
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,040
Something's wrong!

1937
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:00,840
Okay, I'll be right there.

1938
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,000
Hurry!

1939
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:03,460
Perfect!

1940
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,280
Oh my god!

1941
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:04,840
Oh my god!

1942
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:08,820
Meet Mom.

1943
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:13,320
Okay.

1944
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:23,100
Meet...

1945
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:25,640
That must be Mom.

1946
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,180
Oh my god!

1947
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:35,480
Oswald, please.

1948
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,080
I think we're okay.

1949
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:42,760
I'm scared.

1950
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:44,740
Actually, wait.

1951
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:47,380
What the...

1952
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:48,180
I don't know where he is.

1953
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:52,320
If he's like in the hallway 2 or something, you know, we could bait him.

1954
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:54,960
Let's just...

1955
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:55,760
Let's just go for it.

1956
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:00,340
Let's just go for it.

1957
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:04,980
Oh my god!

1958
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:05,140
Mom!

1959
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:06,620
Mom!

1960
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:09,140
Mom!

1961
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:11,080
Dad's been kidnapped and replaced with...

1962
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:13,580
Kidnapped?

1963
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:14,020
Replaced?

1964
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:14,520
Is this...

1965
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,100
I love my...

1966
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:20,860
Honey, don't you know I married him for his glowing eyes?

1967
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:24,100
What are you... You're so silly, Ozzy.

1968
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,760
That's why I love your dad.

1969
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,200
He's just...

1970
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,280
He's just got such beautiful eyes.

1971
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,400
Is this some kind of prank, Oswald?

1972
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:34,800
Dad looks fine.

1973
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:37,880
You should know better than to fake an emergency while I'm at work.

1974
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,300
Could you, like, talk to him, though?

1975
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:41,380
Like, for two seconds.

1976
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:43,300
The man has not said two words.

1977
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:45,060
But...

1978
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:45,880
Can't you see it?

1979
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,460
I see that Dad is fine.

1980
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:54,600
I don't know what's gotten into you, but go to your room and calm down.

1981
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:56,040
I have to get back to the hospital.

1982
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:57,100
Wait...

1983
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,020
Maybe you should talk to your husband.

1984
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:04,040
But...

1985
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,460
This is so messed up.

1986
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:09,360
Well, it's all up to me, I guess.

1987
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,060
Dad has to be stuck in the ball pit.

1988
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,640
I gotta get back to Jeff's.

1989
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,240
Oh, I do?

1990
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,700
Find a way to escape.

1991
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:24,800
Um... We have this weight-resistant mechanism.

1992
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,940
And we have a sturdy rope.

1993
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:32,980
I'm thinking...

1994
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:35,460
Can we leave from here?

1995
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:38,840
The latch...

1996
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:41,560
The latch is rusted shut.

1997
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,380
I think I can unscrew the bolts though.

1998
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:45,520
Gotta find a screwdriver.

1999
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:47,420
Okay...

2000
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:49,340
Is he coming to my room?

2001
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:50,820
Is he that creepy?

2002
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,840
Are you just gonna walk into someone's room?

2003
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:57,680
Screwdriver...

2004
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:03,080
Where haven't we gone exploring so much?

2005
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:07,240
Was there one in the basement and I missed it?

2006
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:18,320
I have a feeling the front door will be locked and he'll be like, I don't know how to unlock it!

2007
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:21,080
I also hate going to the living room because...

2008
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,000
Because...

2009
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:24,860
There's nowhere to hide in there.

2010
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:27,600
Attic window...

2011
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:34,390
Hmm...

2012
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:36,590
Hello mouse cursor, sorry.

2013
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:38,030
I'm like half using it.

2014
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,520
My room is creepy.

2015
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:45,700
Creepy.

2016
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:00,040
Is he in the ceiling?

2017
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:01,220
Shit.

2018
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:03,580
Yeah, I think he was in the attic.

2019
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:06,000
Here he comes!

2020
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:16,910
I like how he knocks.

2021
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,470
Thank you for knocking first.

2022
01:31:20,590 --> 01:31:21,090
Thank you.

2023
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:33,350
Oh my god, oh my god.

2024
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:35,810
I did not know that was going to make noise.

2025
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:38,030
I thought it was going to...

2026
01:31:39,010 --> 01:31:39,690
I thought...

2027
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:44,500
The drawer...

2028
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:52,980
I thought I was searching the drawer...

2029
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:55,300
Okay.

2030
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,520
Maybe in here.

2031
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,000
Mom keeps her medical scrubs in here.

2032
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:04,940
Did she leave this battery?

2033
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,000
We got another battery.

2034
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:06,480
Interesting.

2035
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:09,140
Oh my god!

2036
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:09,980
Oh my god!

2037
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:10,760
What was that?

2038
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:12,100
Oh my god!

2039
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,340
The cat.

2040
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,360
The cat gets around.

2041
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:17,740
Some pictures of my family.

2042
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,980
Mom and dad at Halloween.

2043
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,700
Grandma holding me as a baby.

2044
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:28,540
I love cat.

2045
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:30,820
Um...

2046
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:31,820
And here.

2047
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,780
Lots of clothes in here.

2048
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:35,180
Come on, you're a...

2049
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:35,780
You're a dad!

2050
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,880
You don't keep your screwdriver in your bedroom!

2051
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,360
Can you pet the cat?

2052
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:42,920
You can't?

2053
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:45,860
Not letting me.

2054
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:51,620
I don't know where he is.

2055
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:57,450
I think he is...

2056
01:32:58,130 --> 01:32:58,870
In the hallway?

2057
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:00,010
Dining room?

2058
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:01,230
He's on the left side.

2059
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:04,610
Here he comes!

2060
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:05,270
Maybe...

2061
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:12,260
I'm not a dad, but I keep a screwdriver in my bedroom.

2062
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:13,180
That's what I'm saying!

2063
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,000
Okay, he's still over there.

2064
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:20,620
How long is this game, by the way?

2065
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:23,500
Oh my gosh!

2066
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,600
He did not give any warning that time.

2067
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:27,560
He did not give any warning that time.

2068
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:44,450
Let's try the basement.

2069
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,050
Four or five hours?

2070
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:47,430
Okay.

2071
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:49,410
So like...

2072
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:49,590
Oh!

2073
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:50,690
A battery!

2074
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:51,850
Oh my god, another battery.

2075
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:55,090
I miss when the furnace was down here.

2076
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:58,270
Oh, I miss when the furnace down here was the scariest thing in this house.

2077
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:03,310
I can't reach the window.

2078
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:04,930
Dad has a ladder around here somewhere.

2079
01:34:05,330 --> 01:34:05,730
Oh!

2080
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:08,970
Oh, wait!

2081
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:10,410
A ladder instead, maybe?

2082
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:13,890
Do I have to use a ladder?

2083
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:14,450
Okay.

2084
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:16,150
Damn.

2085
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:19,590
Are you coming in here?

2086
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:21,970
You have no reason to be in here!

2087
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:23,530
Go back to sleep!

2088
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:25,170
Father?

2089
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,800
We still have the rope.

2090
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,420
So it's either...

2091
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:40,540
Okay.

2092
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:43,900
So we can either find a screwdriver and go back to our room.

2093
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,780
Or we can find a...

2094
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:47,840
Or we can find a...

2095
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:48,140
I can't tell.

2096
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:49,240
Does this pause the game?

2097
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,400
Or we can find...

2098
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:52,880
A ladder.

2099
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:04,590
Found the phone number for Jeff's pizza.

2100
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:06,790
555-5333.

2101
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:08,470
Can you guys remember that?

2102
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:12,550
Can you guys remember that for me?

2103
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:16,650
Screwdriver.

2104
01:35:16,890 --> 01:35:17,850
No time for games.

2105
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:18,450
Oh, that's right.

2106
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:18,950
This is the...

2107
01:35:19,390 --> 01:35:20,030
That's my bad.

2108
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,980
Go up into the attic.

2109
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:32,620
We brought it up here once we got Jinx.

2110
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:36,500
Jinx's tail had too many close calls with this rocking chair for mom's liking.

2111
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,100
Oh!

2112
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:38,120
Wait.

2113
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:41,320
Two?

2114
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:41,960
Or three?

2115
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:42,800
Oh.

2116
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,420
I can't use that here?

2117
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:48,480
I have this rope I found earlier.

2118
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:49,280
I should be strong enough.

2119
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,580
Oh my god, I made it!

2120
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:52,960
Wait!

2121
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,200
Oh, that was so easy!

2122
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:57,240
Oh, yo!

2123
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:57,880
Okay.

2124
01:35:59,220 --> 01:35:59,960
The mill?

2125
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:00,880
Library?

2126
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:01,500
School?

2127
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:03,420
Can I go to any of these places?

2128
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:08,240
Wait, what?

2129
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:10,360
What do you mean library night one?

2130
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,280
Go to the ball pit.

2131
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:14,540
Oh.

2132
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:17,300
Yes.

2133
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:21,160
You know, the ball pit that is very famous at the library.

2134
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:28,260
Okay.

2135
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:29,620
Okay.

2136
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:35,320
Jeff's pizza looks boppin'.

2137
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:36,240
It's still open.

2138
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:37,960
Oh, hi Jeff!

2139
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:40,720
Hey Jeff.

2140
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:42,620
You're here late, kid.

2141
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,160
Your parents know you're here?

2142
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:45,480
Uh, yeah.

2143
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:47,200
Dad burnt dinner, so...

2144
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,220
Emergency pizza.

2145
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:50,340
What was he making?

2146
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,860
Uh... pizza.

2147
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,000
Oh, ramen noodles.

2148
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,740
As in the microwave kind?

2149
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:58,920
As in the microwave kind?

2150
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:00,400
No, you're not supposed to microwave those!

2151
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:04,680
Only recently, you know those ramen noodle cups?

2152
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:05,060
You know?

2153
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:10,220
They never were supposed to be microwaved before.

2154
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:13,860
Only recently did they make quote-unquote microwavable noodle cups.

2155
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:23,430
They started making the cups paper.

2156
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:24,030
Yeah.

2157
01:37:24,450 --> 01:37:25,190
Ah, yeah.

2158
01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:25,810
Been there.

2159
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:28,110
They forget to add water once the smell...

2160
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:30,030
Oh, and the smell haunts you forever.

2161
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:31,890
Ew, burnt noodle smell.

2162
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:34,470
Can we go in here?

2163
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:35,730
Oh, the arcade!

2164
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:40,790
All the games from the past are still here.

2165
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:43,970
Looks like they've gotten pretty beat up over the years.

2166
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:46,830
None of them look playable with how many parts they're missing.

2167
01:37:47,110 --> 01:37:47,490
Awww.

2168
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:49,210
Oh my god.

2169
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:50,650
This is where Burger Kid was!

2170
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:52,430
Microplastics.

2171
01:37:52,710 --> 01:37:53,030
Mmm.

2172
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:56,690
What a free tour of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Kit Factory.

2173
01:37:57,490 --> 01:37:57,930
What?

2174
01:37:59,730 --> 01:38:00,610
Sounds awesome.

2175
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:03,790
It's so dark in here I can barely see anything.

2176
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:05,570
I don't have the right item for this cabinet.

2177
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:06,450
Oh, okay.

2178
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:07,990
What game?

2179
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:09,170
Game dialogue.

2180
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:11,810
Oh, we got a space age speaker.

2181
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:20,230
Well, we can just go anywhere we feel in this place now?

2182
01:38:20,330 --> 01:38:20,510
Okay.

2183
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:22,350
I have an electron gun?

2184
01:38:22,990 --> 01:38:24,030
What the hell is that?

2185
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:27,350
What is an electron gun?

2186
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:29,270
These TVs look super cool.

2187
01:38:29,290 --> 01:38:29,550
Super old.

2188
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:30,970
Why is Jeff keeping them?

2189
01:38:32,470 --> 01:38:33,970
No reason to use the vents here.

2190
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:35,950
I've messed around Jeff's place enough already.

2191
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:40,330
Wait, it's the guy at the counter, Jeff!

2192
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:46,490
Wait, it gives the... what was it?

2193
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:49,830
It gives the arcade games a unique look.

2194
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:51,830
Oh!

2195
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,960
Who did you think Jeff was?

2196
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:02,960
I don't know!

2197
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:03,280
Oh!

2198
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:04,900
Oh, this is a party room.

2199
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:09,600
We're collecting things to rebuild the panel.

2200
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:11,300
Not the panel, the arcane machine.

2201
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:14,160
You just realized that?

2202
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:15,780
Well, you know how like sometimes...

2203
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:17,340
I thought it was like maybe a chain.

2204
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:21,620
And like it was just some, you know, some teenager working here.

2205
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:22,760
But he didn't really care.

2206
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:25,120
Door is locked.

2207
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,080
Okay, we still can't go into the kitchen.

2208
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:27,660
How mysterious.

2209
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:29,540
What's in the kitchen?

2210
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:30,560
I'm so excited.

2211
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:37,120
His name is on every dialogue box?

2212
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:39,380
I didn't really look.

2213
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:40,180
I didn't really look.

2214
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:44,240
Okay, into security is also locked.

2215
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:44,740
Okay.

2216
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,220
But that's where Phone Guy is.

2217
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,140
Ew, Bonnie's face looks so scary.

2218
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,620
Don't have the right stuff for this cabin.

2219
01:39:58,620 --> 01:39:59,200
Oh, wait.

2220
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:00,120
This one I do.

2221
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,040
This one's good to go.

2222
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,940
Took out the token system for unlimited play.

2223
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:15,200
Oh my god.

2224
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:16,120
Ozzy is a hacker!

2225
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:17,940
Ozzy!

2226
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,240
How do you know how to do this?

2227
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,300
Looks like there's still tickets in there too.

2228
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:26,960
I'm glad I've watched Dad repair so many random things over the years.

2229
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:30,040
Okay, let's go!

2230
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:33,180
Don't have the right things for this one.

2231
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:34,540
We have speakers.

2232
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:35,620
Where can speakers go?

2233
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:36,080
Here?

2234
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,100
Can't use that here.

2235
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:42,820
Can't use that here.

2236
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:44,200
Wait.

2237
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:44,940
Is it?

2238
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:45,480
Wait.

2239
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,200
Is it this?

2240
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:52,460
What does the binary say?

2241
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:54,280
Nice.

2242
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:09,010
Stein's here.

2243
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:12,170
So we're gonna...

2244
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:14,050
Some of the stuff we got from home...

2245
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:20,330
So, are we gonna have to go home and get more... or we might have to go to other places, other locations and find scrap?

2246
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:22,530
Interesting.

2247
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:28,630
I'm so sorry, Jeff.

2248
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:30,650
Shouldn't you be doing...

2249
01:41:30,650 --> 01:41:32,570
Shouldn't you be at home doing some homework or something?

2250
01:41:32,650 --> 01:41:32,830
Kid.

2251
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:36,390
I thought Jeff was just a tired teenager.

2252
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:40,390
You can play the games you fix?

2253
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:41,550
I can?

2254
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:44,290
Let's go play a game.

2255
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:46,590
I forgive you.

2256
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:52,950
Fast food invader!

2257
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:54,670
Wait.

2258
01:41:56,670 --> 01:41:57,350
Oh my god.

2259
01:41:57,370 --> 01:41:57,630
Toho?

2260
01:41:58,130 --> 01:41:59,130
Oh no, it's Toho.

2261
01:42:02,130 --> 01:42:03,810
Oh, and I have to... I can't just...

2262
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:05,270
I can't just hold down space.

2263
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:07,050
I have to move and shoot.

2264
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:12,450
Or rather, I can't just hold down space for... I have to continuously press it.

2265
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:16,330
Oh my god.

2266
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:18,190
You hit every...

2267
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:20,450
thing... every...

2268
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:23,130
Oh my god.

2269
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:23,350
Oh my god.

2270
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:24,090
I'm gonna get the high score.

2271
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:25,190
I'm gonna get the high score.

2272
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:26,490
Screw you, Gregory.

2273
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:34,760
Oh my god.

2274
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:36,780
You miss every shot you don't take.

2275
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:40,040
Or you just miss every shot.

2276
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:49,750
Oh my god.

2277
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:50,190
Oh my god.

2278
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:50,710
Oh my god.

2279
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:51,210
Oh my god.

2280
01:42:51,230 --> 01:42:51,610
Oh my god.

2281
01:42:51,810 --> 01:42:52,510
There's so many.

2282
01:42:56,990 --> 01:42:59,190
Oh my god.

2283
01:42:59,190 --> 01:43:01,430
Oh my god.

2284
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:03,430
This is the real gameplay everybody.

2285
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:05,250
Space...

2286
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:08,510
Fast Food Invader Baby.

2287
01:43:12,410 --> 01:43:13,150
Come here.

2288
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:14,490
There we go.

2289
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:16,510
Oh my god!

2290
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:17,850
Gregory!

2291
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:20,550
Hamburger!

2292
01:43:28,270 --> 01:43:29,030
Kill him.

2293
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:30,330
Oh my god.

2294
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:30,950
Oh my god.

2295
01:43:31,070 --> 01:43:31,690
Oh my god.

2296
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:32,510
Oh my god.

2297
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:33,390
Oh my god.

2298
01:43:33,550 --> 01:43:34,270
Oh my god.

2299
01:43:35,170 --> 01:43:35,290
Kill!

2300
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:35,530
Kill!

2301
01:43:35,570 --> 01:43:35,770
Kill!

2302
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:35,850
Kill!

2303
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:42,060
Burger.

2304
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:43,900
Oh my god.

2305
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,680
They're too fast for me.

2306
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:50,000
I gotta get the pizza.

2307
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:56,840
Oh god, it's getting...

2308
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:59,260
Oh, I can only go up so high.

2309
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:02,320
I'm so used to Touhou where I can go to the top of the screen.

2310
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:06,260
Oh gosh.

2311
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:07,500
Oh golly.

2312
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:07,840
Okay.

2313
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:08,200
Okay.

2314
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:09,200
Come on.

2315
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:11,040
Okay.

2316
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,780
No grazes SMH.

2317
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:20,340
I died?

2318
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:24,440
I can screenshot this?

2319
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:26,200
Oh!

2320
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:27,040
Fun!

2321
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:31,820
I can take a screenshot from Freddy Fazbear's...

2322
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:35,380
Continue?

2323
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,280
New music unlock.

2324
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,080
Space shooter.

2325
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:42,000
Cool.

2326
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,540
Looks like I got some tickets.

2327
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:45,320
Eleven tickets.

2328
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:46,280
What's these?

2329
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:55,300
Heftin with...

2330
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:56,860
Helpulies.

2331
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,400
Ten curls!

2332
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:24,760
I felt the burn, yeah.

2333
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:26,660
Dun dun!

2334
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:30,180
Hold on, I want to try that one again.

2335
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:31,180
I didn't get any tickets for it!

2336
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:53,760
It's... it's...

2337
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,280
Press E, you guys!

2338
01:45:58,220 --> 01:45:59,460
I wonder if it's easier.

2339
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:01,940
Let me try on my laptop one instead.

2340
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:06,840
Because I have both keyboards.

2341
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:08,200
And this is flatter, you know?

2342
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:08,880
Oh god.

2343
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:10,320
But it's harder for me to reach it.

2344
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:11,000
Yeah!

2345
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:12,020
Yeah!

2346
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,770
I don't...

2347
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:18,450
Use both keyboards?

2348
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:20,870
Are you a genius?

2349
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:22,290
Hold on, let's try it.

2350
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:22,830
Let's try it.

2351
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:26,070
Don't even think about using auto fire.

2352
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:27,030
Hell no.

2353
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:30,290
Okay, hold on.

2354
01:46:30,310 --> 01:46:31,250
Let's use both E's.

2355
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:37,840
I think I'm confusing the system.

2356
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,320
Oh my god.

2357
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,220
This is actually working.

2358
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,280
Oh my god.

2359
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:44,280
This is kind of working.

2360
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:44,460
It's working!

2361
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:46,220
It's

2362
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:56,760
insane!

2363
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,240
That was awesome.

2364
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:02,120
It didn't give me any more tickets though.

2365
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:02,840
Sorry, Ozzy.

2366
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:03,680
Let's try this one.

2367
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:07,780
Collect the hats.

2368
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:13,460
Oh my god.

2369
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,040
I'm Balloon Boy.

2370
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:16,720
Oh, wait.

2371
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:17,460
Huh?

2372
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:24,470
Oh, okay.

2373
01:47:24,570 --> 01:47:24,830
I see.

2374
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:24,990
I see.

2375
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:25,690
You died.

2376
01:47:26,730 --> 01:47:27,170
Sorry.

2377
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:28,150
One more.

2378
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:28,550
One more.

2379
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:28,890
One more.

2380
01:47:29,230 --> 01:47:29,970
Aw, man.

2381
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:31,830
Okay.

2382
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:36,200
Now, I didn't notice the thing at first.

2383
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:38,740
The bombs, you know?

2384
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,100
Coming after me.

2385
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:44,800
We gotta wait.

2386
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,040
Oh, shoot.

2387
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:49,340
Shoot!

2388
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:50,520
No, no.

2389
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:53,520
What is this Jump King-ish?

2390
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:56,180
Can I be on top of it?

2391
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:56,640
Okay, no.

2392
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:57,620
Okay.

2393
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:00,160
Alright.

2394
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:01,560
And then...

2395
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:02,980
Okay, nice.

2396
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:06,120
And then we'll wait for that.

2397
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:09,520
Okay, nice.

2398
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:12,380
Oh, no!

2399
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:16,320
Maybe this side is...

2400
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:16,680
Oh, wait.

2401
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:19,760
Maybe...

2402
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:23,520
No, I don't...

2403
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,080
Actually, I think this side is easier.

2404
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:26,240
Okay.

2405
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:27,520
Okay.

2406
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:27,600
Okay.

2407
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:27,680
Okay.

2408
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:28,140
Jump King.

2409
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:33,100
Oh my God.

2410
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:34,120
That was so close!

2411
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:36,800
Leave!

2412
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:39,820
Yippee!

2413
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:43,840
I won!

2414
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,420
I got five more tickets.

2415
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:49,960
Nice.

2416
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:50,460
Okay.

2417
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,320
Okay.

2418
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:53,860
The ball pit.

2419
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:57,500
Is there anything else that I haven't collected?

2420
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:57,580
I don't know.

2421
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:00,840
I just want to keep playing games now.

2422
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:04,880
There's one more hat?

2423
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:05,780
Oh, there is?

2424
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:08,720
All this stuff in here.

2425
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:10,920
So creepy.

2426
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,920
I don't have the right item for this cabinet.

2427
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:16,300
Okay.

2428
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:17,140
Still got it.

2429
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:20,200
Remember FNAF 3's Balloon Boy minigame?

2430
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:20,700
Try that.

2431
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:22,260
Oh.

2432
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:25,240
Actually...

2433
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:26,460
I don't.

2434
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:27,540
I'm sorry.

2435
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:30,700
I'm like kind of a fake FNAF fan.

2436
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:35,520
Is this my pizza?

2437
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,440
Isn't that where I was eating earlier?

2438
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:46,260
Oh.

2439
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:49,920
You know what the stage was for now, Oswald.

2440
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:52,480
Don't act...

2441
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:53,520
Don't act dumb.

2442
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:53,880
Oh.

2443
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:54,160
Sorry.

2444
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:56,660
Can I go into the basement?

2445
01:49:57,540 --> 01:49:57,940
Locked.

2446
01:49:57,940 --> 01:49:58,120
Okay.

2447
01:49:58,180 --> 01:49:58,840
It's still locked.

2448
01:49:59,360 --> 01:49:59,940
All right.

2449
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:01,020
Go to the ball pit, baby.

2450
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:02,760
Quickly.

2451
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:05,220
We've had enough of a little bit of a rest, I guess.

2452
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:09,260
Do you?

2453
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,020
Do you?

2454
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:13,960
The faded version of the mural is even creepier.

2455
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,460
I really like the ambiance in this game.

2456
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:20,760
It's very good.

2457
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:26,880
Okay.

2458
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,040
Now I gotta find Dad.

2459
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:33,360
Oh, God.

2460
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,000
What?

2461
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:37,240
Is that a kid crying?

2462
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:38,880
Maybe they need help.

2463
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,320
Oswald, you don't...

2464
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:44,800
Sorry.

2465
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:46,400
My computer keeps sending me notifications.

2466
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:48,780
Windows 11 is so annoying.

2467
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:54,680
You don't have to be a savior, Ozzy.

2468
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:58,700
Find the kid.

2469
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:03,640
Oh, they're gone.

2470
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:04,360
Uh-oh.

2471
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:04,780
They're gone.

2472
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:05,660
Uh-oh.

2473
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:06,100
They're gone.

2474
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:09,340
Due to an incident with our previous Freddy animatronic...

2475
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:14,240
We request that all guests refrain from shining any lasers into the eyes of our performers.

2476
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,040
Thank you for your compliance.

2477
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:19,040
Wait.

2478
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:21,740
Where did these three go now?

2479
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:23,460
Oh.

2480
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:29,260
We can go back here.

2481
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,140
Oh, there's endoskeletons.

2482
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:35,840
They look even creepier torn apart like this.

2483
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:39,500
Like this shelf with some kind of hunter's trophy display.

2484
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:42,800
A fuse box.

2485
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:43,760
Dad's one-shot.

2486
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:44,940
Someone showed me how to use one of those.

2487
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:46,460
Do I...

2488
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:47,400
I guess...

2489
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:50,340
This wallet belongs to Dad!

2490
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:51,740
He has to be here somewhere.

2491
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:52,720
Oh my God.

2492
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:53,580
We got our Dad's wallet.

2493
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:54,620
Why did it...

2494
01:51:54,620 --> 01:51:55,380
Oh my God.

2495
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:59,320
Why does picking up the coins make so much noise?

2496
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:02,700
Find the kid.

2497
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:03,660
It's locked.

2498
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:04,000
Okay.

2499
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:04,900
Where am I, anyway?

2500
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:06,120
Oh, backstage.

2501
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:06,480
Okay.

2502
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:10,760
Wait.

2503
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:11,280
Is someone here?

2504
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:13,320
Why is the ambience so loud all of a sudden?

2505
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:14,480
I don't know.

2506
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:15,500
I don't know.

2507
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:16,900
Okay.

2508
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:17,660
Guess we're good.

2509
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:25,420
Do you guys hear the kid?

2510
01:52:30,890 --> 01:52:32,790
That doesn't sound like a real kid.

2511
01:52:33,070 --> 01:52:34,730
That sounds like mechanic kid.

2512
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:42,810
Oh my God!

2513
01:52:43,910 --> 01:52:44,690
A coin.

2514
01:52:59,050 --> 01:52:59,570
Can

2515
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:03,810
I help you?

2516
01:53:04,490 --> 01:53:05,010
Sir?

2517
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:06,670
Help me.

2518
01:53:06,730 --> 01:53:07,510
I can't get out.

2519
01:53:08,130 --> 01:53:09,430
How did you get in there?

2520
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:12,590
Something grabbed me.

2521
01:53:12,610 --> 01:53:13,370
Something grabbed me and sucked me in.

2522
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:16,890
It feels like the suit is going to snapshot.

2523
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:20,310
I think I can loosen the bolts with it.

2524
01:53:20,370 --> 01:53:20,650
Uh-oh.

2525
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:21,750
A screwdriver.

2526
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:25,330
A screwdriver.

2527
01:53:26,490 --> 01:53:27,590
I'll find one.

2528
01:53:27,730 --> 01:53:28,190
Oh, gosh.

2529
01:53:28,190 --> 01:53:30,250
If only I had found the screwdriver before.

2530
01:53:34,150 --> 01:53:35,230
I'm such an idiot.

2531
01:53:38,210 --> 01:53:39,830
Don't check behind the curtain.

2532
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:40,310
Okay.

2533
01:53:40,570 --> 01:53:41,010
Okay.

2534
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:48,280
Okay.

2535
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:48,760
Who's laughing?

2536
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:54,110
Oh, shit.

2537
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:55,070
Oh, shit.

2538
01:53:55,150 --> 01:53:55,310
Oh, shit.

2539
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:55,550
Oh, shit.

2540
01:53:57,910 --> 01:53:58,610
Sorry, kid.

2541
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:01,510
Can you, like, be quiet for, like, two seconds?

2542
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:14,120
I thought something was coming.

2543
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:14,540
Maybe not.

2544
01:54:18,940 --> 01:54:19,260
Watch.

2545
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:20,060
I opened the door.

2546
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:20,620
Is there going to be...

2547
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:23,100
I thought there'd be someone in here.

2548
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:23,720
Oh, gosh.

2549
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,440
Can't open it with it screwed in.

2550
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:27,120
I don't want to be screwed shut like that.

2551
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:29,000
So, I really need to find a screwdriver.

2552
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:32,860
How do I get one, though?

2553
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:33,800
Nope.

2554
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:35,220
You saw what happened last time.

2555
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:36,800
Huh?

2556
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:37,620
Wait.

2557
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:38,220
Does he remember?

2558
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:40,820
Ah!

2559
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:43,520
Wait.

2560
01:54:48,570 --> 01:54:50,810
He remembers from the previous ending?

2561
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:52,210
Okay.

2562
01:54:59,110 --> 01:54:59,730
Hold on.

2563
01:55:00,010 --> 01:55:00,490
Okay.

2564
01:55:00,490 --> 01:55:00,850
Okay.

2565
01:55:01,470 --> 01:55:01,950
Okay.

2566
01:55:01,950 --> 01:55:02,310
Okay.

2567
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:04,250
Okay.

2568
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:08,930
Why is there an X by the entrance?

2569
01:55:10,530 --> 01:55:11,890
Why is there an X right here?

2570
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:14,130
I wish I could zoom in, but I cannot.

2571
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:23,890
Is it the vent?

2572
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:25,710
Oh, because the vent is locked right now?

2573
01:55:26,610 --> 01:55:27,010
Hmm.

2574
01:55:29,810 --> 01:55:30,210
Maybe.

2575
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:32,310
Okay.

2576
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:34,310
So, we can't go through the party hallway.

2577
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:35,470
We have to go up.

2578
01:55:35,550 --> 01:55:35,630
Okay.

2579
01:55:35,650 --> 01:55:37,530
I'm not sure.

2580
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:40,360
I'm not sure.

2581
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:40,940
Maybe, they're gone.

2582
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:46,120
Who's yelling?

2583
01:55:47,620 --> 01:55:48,320
Who's screaming?

2584
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:49,540
Oh, wait.

2585
01:55:49,580 --> 01:55:49,960
The door...

2586
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:50,380
Oh, gosh.

2587
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:51,600
All the doors are different now.

2588
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:53,380
Oh, my God.

2589
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:00,240
Okay.

2590
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:05,660
I was going to say, I don't hear him crying anymore.

2591
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:06,600
But yes, I do.

2592
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:09,700
Okay.

2593
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:10,000
Okay.

2594
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,960
Just a... Hold on a minute there, buddy.

2595
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:14,960
He's like, can you please at least run.

2596
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:16,680
This door is locked now, too.

2597
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,680
Wait, where the heck am I supposed to go?

2598
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:23,460
This door is locked.

2599
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:25,900
This one leads to the kitchen.

2600
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:31,320
Do I come back?

2601
01:56:33,580 --> 01:56:36,920
Do I go to my plate?

2602
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:37,340
Wait.

2603
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:40,000
I don't think this would help now.

2604
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:42,920
Do I go back to the present time and then I...

2605
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:45,140
Looks like they were trying to fix this one.

2606
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,200
Hope it stays broken forever.

2607
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:53,580
Maybe we go back to the... Oh my god.

2608
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:54,860
What was that?

2609
01:56:56,380 --> 01:56:58,980
Is that what those things look like on the inside?

2610
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:01,680
Better than being made of flesh and blood, I guess.

2611
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:04,760
I mean, it's animatronic.

2612
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:06,600
What did you expect there, Ozzy?

2613
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:17,260
Average VTuber reading comprehension?

2614
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:18,400
What do you mean?

2615
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:21,080
It's just... Oh, find the key.

2616
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:24,740
Wait, when did it update to find the key as the objective?

2617
01:57:30,030 --> 01:57:30,830
For this room?

2618
01:57:31,910 --> 01:57:33,350
Oh, I bet the screwdriver's in there.

2619
01:57:33,430 --> 01:57:33,610
Okay.

2620
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:34,870
Okay, you have... Okay.

2621
01:57:35,110 --> 01:57:39,350
To be fair, I didn't read it because I thought it was the same thing as before.

2622
01:57:41,110 --> 01:57:42,650
Because I checked the door earlier.

2623
01:57:43,070 --> 01:57:45,930
If this is the same pizza place, I wonder if Jeff has the same key.

2624
01:57:47,290 --> 01:57:48,370
Ah, I see.

2625
01:57:48,570 --> 01:57:51,130
Oh wow, so we have to actually go and get the key from Jeff.

2626
01:57:51,490 --> 01:57:53,010
Find a way to snap the suit instead.

2627
01:57:53,370 --> 01:57:55,350
The faster the kid stops crying, the better.

2628
01:57:57,430 --> 01:58:00,890
Yeah, to be fair, that's the only reason why I didn't read it.

2629
01:58:03,170 --> 01:58:05,550
Because I thought it... Some of the dialogue stays the same.

2630
01:58:05,830 --> 01:58:06,770
Some of it's different.

2631
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:09,190
Okay, here we go.

2632
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,920
Okay, this place is safe though.

2633
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:22,300
Yeah, this place is safe though, right?

2634
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:25,240
Jeff, I'm here to commit robbery.

2635
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:30,440
I'm here to commit robbery.

2636
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:37,420
Jeff, do you have a key to the basement?

2637
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:39,820
First the ball pit, now the basement.

2638
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:40,900
Are you that bored kid?

2639
01:58:41,660 --> 01:58:42,360
Um, yes.

2640
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:43,580
I just feel like exploring.

2641
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:45,380
Well, let's make a deal.

2642
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:46,400
Just between you and me.

2643
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:49,820
I don't pay for trash and forgot to dump a bag at the mill earlier.

2644
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:52,520
Go take that trash over there.

2645
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,880
Out, and I'll give you the key when you get back.

2646
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:57,740
Oh, but take this flashlight.

2647
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:59,200
Gets pretty dark out there.

2648
01:59:00,780 --> 01:59:02,860
Thanks, but the battery is pretty low.

2649
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:05,220
Dig around the trash if you run out.

2650
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:07,640
Probably all sorts of interesting things in there.

2651
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:09,020
Okay.

2652
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,400
Hold F to reload the battery.

2653
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,500
Wait, it's already out?

2654
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:18,480
No way.

2655
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:20,160
I just took it out for two seconds.

2656
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,040
Here we go.

2657
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:31,400
You're asking like a ten-year-old to take your trash out.

2658
01:59:31,700 --> 01:59:33,100
In the middle of the night?

2659
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:43,820
No.

2660
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:47,540
Dump the trash.

2661
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:49,100
What's this?

2662
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:50,700
Oh, battery.

2663
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:51,360
Battery.

2664
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:52,040
Oh, puzzle.

2665
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:55,000
Wait, no, not yet.

2666
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:55,480
Come on.

2667
01:59:55,820 --> 01:59:57,400
I thought I saw one other hand.

2668
01:59:58,980 --> 01:59:59,460
What the?

2669
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:03,600
There's eye... Oops, sorry, my bad.

2670
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:05,200
There's eyes here.

2671
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:10,260
There's eyes here.

2672
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:12,460
I shouldn't have wasted the flashlight's battery.

2673
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:14,480
Okay, you're right.

2674
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:16,620
The mill closed down three years ago.

2675
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:19,360
Almost everything else in this town has been closed since.

2676
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:23,400
It looks like Mickey Mouse.

2677
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:25,100
Rat trap.

2678
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:28,740
Oh, no.

2679
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:29,760
Go back to the mill.

2680
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:31,620
Um...

2681
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:33,940
Rat trap.

2682
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:38,660
Here's my favorite name to say from Beast...

2683
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:40,000
Um, from Breasties.

2684
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:42,560
Uh...

2685
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:45,760
Yuck.

2686
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:49,040
Pretty certain this trash has been sitting here since the mill closed.

2687
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:51,960
Okay, I think that's everything then.

2688
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:54,780
Mill closed.

2689
02:00:55,820 --> 02:00:57,180
Nothing else over here.

2690
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:58,160
I guess we're good.

2691
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:03,070
Back to the pizzeria.

2692
02:01:09,030 --> 02:01:10,890
This is the longest night ever.

2693
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:12,070
Or am I just slow?

2694
02:01:13,590 --> 02:01:14,470
Get the key.

2695
02:01:15,630 --> 02:01:17,830
Every time you hear that, the objective is changing.

2696
02:01:17,910 --> 02:01:19,390
But you guys are kind of blocking the chat.

2697
02:01:19,670 --> 02:01:22,690
This game has just too much going on in all corners, you know?

2698
02:01:23,790 --> 02:01:25,170
Lampy, thanks so much for the gifted.

2699
02:01:26,570 --> 02:01:27,190
All done.

2700
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:29,170
Thanks, kid.

2701
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:30,610
Saved my aching back.

2702
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:32,570
Here's the key.

2703
02:01:32,690 --> 02:01:33,470
As promised.

2704
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:36,290
Thank you.

2705
02:01:36,350 --> 02:01:37,970
Look for a screwdriver in the basement.

2706
02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:39,170
Perfect.

2707
02:01:42,430 --> 02:01:43,070
I wonder...

2708
02:01:43,690 --> 02:01:45,210
if we can look in this one as well.

2709
02:01:48,690 --> 02:01:50,110
Yeah, this is our corner.

2710
02:01:50,590 --> 02:01:51,670
Get out of here, objective.

2711
02:01:56,190 --> 02:01:56,870
Oh, nope.

2712
02:01:56,950 --> 02:01:57,750
That's not what it is.

2713
02:01:59,810 --> 02:02:00,310
There we go.

2714
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:03,430
He's right about finding cool stuff in the trash.

2715
02:02:03,550 --> 02:02:06,090
When I was 10, I went to the dumpster diving with my friend, Twinkie.

2716
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:09,350
He went by Porkchop back then.

2717
02:02:09,370 --> 02:02:11,210
We got a lamp and a book on electronics.

2718
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:15,970
Is this a reference to something?

2719
02:02:18,690 --> 02:02:19,550
I can't tell.

2720
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:20,230
Is this a...

2721
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:25,540
Oh, God.

2722
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:29,920
Oh, no, no.

2723
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:31,240
Huh?

2724
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:33,020
There seems to be a battery underneath.

2725
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:33,960
Okay, awesome.

2726
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:35,160
How many batteries do I have?

2727
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:42,280
For some reason, my inventory is only showing a rat trap.

2728
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:45,780
There's something here, though.

2729
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:47,800
Oh, what's this?

2730
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:52,500
It was there.

2731
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:52,920
It was there.

2732
02:02:53,940 --> 02:02:55,180
You guys saw it, right?

2733
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,080
Okay.

2734
02:02:57,100 --> 02:02:58,020
Grab the screwdriver.

2735
02:02:58,400 --> 02:02:59,060
There we go.

2736
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:01,460
No reason to use the...

2737
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,180
Oh, the vents.

2738
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:02,660
Dang it.

2739
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:03,040
Okay.

2740
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:04,660
Okay.

2741
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:05,140
Grab the screwdriver.

2742
02:03:05,140 --> 02:03:05,320
Grab it.

2743
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:07,100
This thing's too rusty to use.

2744
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:08,420
Looks like it's been down here for eight...

2745
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:08,900
For decades.

2746
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:10,620
Oh, okay.

2747
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:11,820
So, we go to the present.

2748
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:14,400
I mean, the past.

2749
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:18,240
These look like the games Dad always talked about.

2750
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:19,660
Okay.

2751
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:24,280
I have to replace.

2752
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:24,720
Okay.

2753
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:28,740
Back to the future?

2754
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:29,820
No, wait.

2755
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:31,420
No, we're going to the past.

2756
02:03:34,060 --> 02:03:35,200
We're going to the past.

2757
02:03:35,420 --> 02:03:35,760
Oh.

2758
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:38,120
Classic audio.

2759
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:39,200
The Quasi spill.

2760
02:03:48,150 --> 02:03:48,950
All right, kid.

2761
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:50,750
You better still be okay.

2762
02:03:51,050 --> 02:03:52,290
I wasn't gone for that long.

2763
02:03:52,630 --> 02:03:53,970
You still crying over here?

2764
02:03:55,470 --> 02:03:55,930
Yup.

2765
02:03:55,990 --> 02:03:56,370
Okay.

2766
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:09,200
Okay.

2767
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:12,500
Oh God, wait.

2768
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:14,760
The basement is going to be so scary, though.

2769
02:04:20,620 --> 02:04:22,980
Are you telling me they haven't changed the key?

2770
02:04:22,980 --> 02:04:28,280
Oh my

2771
02:04:31,950 --> 02:04:50,530
god, I can barely make out his face in the darkness.

2772
02:04:51,590 --> 02:04:53,590
Oh my god, it's so scary.

2773
02:04:53,590 --> 02:04:55,690
Oh my god, it's so scary!

2774
02:04:59,690 --> 02:05:01,350
What's with these weird spam bots?

2775
02:05:01,510 --> 02:05:02,170
I think it's the game.

2776
02:05:05,490 --> 02:05:07,910
I think it's Five Nights at Freddy's.

2777
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:10,130
And it's a new game, you know?

2778
02:05:10,750 --> 02:05:11,790
Wait, what's that about?

2779
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:16,000
Okay.

2780
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:20,160
Okay, that was just ambience.

2781
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:21,380
Okay.

2782
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:22,200
Alright, we're good.

2783
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:24,920
Alright.

2784
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:31,380
Yeah, where are these guys anyway?

2785
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:33,800
Okay, the kid is still crying.

2786
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:41,960
Hey kid, I'm here to rescue you.

2787
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:46,220
Maybe.

2788
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,200
I don't know, you look pretty snug in there.

2789
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:53,040
Oh my god, it just flopped out!

2790
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:56,240
Phew, thanks.

2791
02:05:56,420 --> 02:05:57,760
I thought I was going to be stuck in there forever.

2792
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:02,540
One second I was talking with my friend and then...

2793
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:04,040
Uh oh.

2794
02:06:05,020 --> 02:06:05,380
Hide?

2795
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:06,380
Hide?

2796
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:08,620
That sounds like him.

2797
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:09,640
He might be in danger.

2798
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:13,640
Wait, I thought that was a... I think that's an animatronic!

2799
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:15,940
Come on, we can find him together!

2800
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:18,080
Escort mission?

2801
02:06:18,380 --> 02:06:19,300
Wait, I'm not moving.

2802
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:23,560
Never mind, let's get out of here!

2803
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:25,800
You're such a coward!

2804
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:30,440
Wait, I'm looking for my dad!

2805
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:33,620
You haven't seen a tall man wearing a blue shirt, have you?

2806
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:36,540
You mean like an adult?

2807
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:40,880
That's what dads usually are.

2808
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:45,780
Oh my gosh, another spam bot.

2809
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:46,900
What's going on here?

2810
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:54,940
No, I haven't.

2811
02:06:55,540 --> 02:06:57,160
Look man, I wish I could help you, but...

2812
02:06:57,160 --> 02:06:57,720
Oh god!

2813
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:02,160
To the ball pit!

2814
02:07:08,230 --> 02:07:08,590
Phew!

2815
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:16,960
Back in my day, we just used to get hot ladies and fire spam bots.

2816
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:17,800
I know I missed those!

2817
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:22,760
I didn't get a lot of time to look for dad, but I gotta think of a better plan first.

2818
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:25,560
I'm sorry dad, stay safe until I get back!

2819
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:28,860
Go home.

2820
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:29,560
Oh, okay.

2821
02:07:30,220 --> 02:07:31,100
Time to go home.

2822
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:35,840
Day 2!

2823
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:39,400
Oswald's house.

2824
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:42,000
Oh my god, recap!

2825
02:07:52,310 --> 02:07:53,670
This is so funny.

2826
02:07:53,710 --> 02:07:54,610
Is she gonna kiss him?

2827
02:07:55,530 --> 02:07:57,570
Are you gonna kiss Springtrap?

2828
02:07:58,370 --> 02:08:00,610
This is so funny.

2829
02:08:02,390 --> 02:08:04,230
Oh my gosh, dinner with Springtrap!

2830
02:08:04,430 --> 02:08:04,930
Let's go!

2831
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:06,890
Such a lovely father.

2832
02:08:08,670 --> 02:08:09,310
No!

2833
02:08:10,390 --> 02:08:12,130
Was it all a dream?

2834
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:15,530
Look at our cat, so concerned.

2835
02:08:15,790 --> 02:08:17,690
I guess I should just start the day then.

2836
02:08:20,350 --> 02:08:22,470
You can pet the cat!

2837
02:08:25,250 --> 02:08:27,290
The little purrs!

2838
02:08:28,450 --> 02:08:30,870
The little purrs!

2839
02:08:31,730 --> 02:08:33,710
When I went to Ayami's house...

2840
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:36,130
And I met her cats...

2841
02:08:37,270 --> 02:08:48,790
She was surprised because Kuma-san was uncharacteristically friendly to me.

2842
02:08:53,130 --> 02:08:55,410
I miss my cats so much.

2843
02:08:55,990 --> 02:08:57,210
You got to meet Poo?

2844
02:08:57,290 --> 02:08:59,170
Yeah, I got to meet Poo-san and Kuma-san.

2845
02:08:59,310 --> 02:09:00,230
They were so cute.

2846
02:09:01,930 --> 02:09:03,470
The purrs sound so good.

2847
02:09:06,130 --> 02:09:07,630
I miss my cats.

2848
02:09:09,050 --> 02:09:10,050
Hello, rabbit.

2849
02:09:10,190 --> 02:09:10,970
That's not all...

2850
02:09:11,930 --> 02:09:14,190
I did to your mom last night, my boy.

2851
02:09:14,350 --> 02:09:14,770
No!

2852
02:09:18,490 --> 02:09:19,090
No!

2853
02:09:20,370 --> 02:09:21,570
What was I gonna say?

2854
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:28,880
Get breakfast.

2855
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:29,440
Okay.

2856
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:32,180
Breaky time!

2857
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:36,200
Anything else we can collect while we're, you know, wandering around?

2858
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:36,820
Let's see.

2859
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:41,220
Oh, there was actually a battery hidden under the clothes in here.

2860
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:42,740
Good thing I dug in deeper this time.

2861
02:09:42,860 --> 02:09:43,920
Oh, wow!

2862
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:47,620
So they encourage you to check places multiple times.

2863
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:48,160
Interesting.

2864
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:49,140
Mom's phone.

2865
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:50,680
Looks like there's some text here from yesterday.

2866
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:53,080
Am I gonna be a snoopy little kid?

2867
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:56,020
Oswald seems to be taking things pretty hard lately.

2868
02:09:56,940 --> 02:10:00,320
It can't be easy for a kid to understand their dad losing his job.

2869
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:04,540
I'll try to think of something nice to do for him when I pick him up from Jeff's tonight.

2870
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:05,100
Awww.

2871
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:12,400
He's such a good dad.

2872
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:15,560
He's such a good dad.

2873
02:10:19,850 --> 02:10:21,850
Mom keeps her medical scrubs in here.

2874
02:10:22,090 --> 02:10:23,510
But no batteries, I guess.

2875
02:10:26,290 --> 02:10:28,650
It's not go- Where do they eat?

2876
02:10:28,770 --> 02:10:30,270
You think the dining- Not the kitchen.

2877
02:10:30,350 --> 02:10:31,150
The dining room, right?

2878
02:10:32,130 --> 02:10:33,770
We can go up here, even.

2879
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:35,550
Everything is daytime.

2880
02:10:35,710 --> 02:10:36,670
I'm so- Not scared.

2881
02:10:39,990 --> 02:10:41,110
Here's the ladder, though.

2882
02:10:41,570 --> 02:10:42,050
Wait!

2883
02:10:44,770 --> 02:10:45,730
Do you see this?

2884
02:10:46,270 --> 02:10:47,770
They boarded up the window!

2885
02:10:47,930 --> 02:10:48,650
You asshole!

2886
02:10:48,930 --> 02:10:49,570
What the hell!

2887
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:52,570
He boarded it up!

2888
02:10:53,950 --> 02:10:55,430
These are our old suitcases.

2889
02:10:55,570 --> 02:10:57,170
We haven't gone away in a long time, though.

2890
02:10:58,830 --> 02:10:59,750
What's that sound?

2891
02:11:00,990 --> 02:11:02,390
Is that Springtrap downstairs?

2892
02:11:04,810 --> 02:11:05,730
Oh wait, no.

2893
02:11:05,810 --> 02:11:06,530
I think that's my footsteps.

2894
02:11:10,710 --> 02:11:13,350
I cannot believe that they boarded up the window!

2895
02:11:16,330 --> 02:11:20,490
I don't want to go to breakfast, just- Yeah, I still want to keep exploring.

2896
02:11:22,690 --> 02:11:22,790
Oh!

2897
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:26,790
My rising sixth grader has risen!

2898
02:11:26,950 --> 02:11:28,230
Oh, school starts today!

2899
02:11:28,350 --> 02:11:28,710
That's right!

2900
02:11:29,110 --> 02:11:29,510
Huh?

2901
02:11:29,970 --> 02:11:31,190
The first day of school!

2902
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:33,030
Are you still asleep, young man?

2903
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:34,670
I hope not.

2904
02:11:34,850 --> 02:11:36,830
I had the strangest dream about Dad!

2905
02:11:37,410 --> 02:11:38,850
Don't worry, Dad's fine.

2906
02:11:39,030 --> 02:11:40,750
He's waiting for you in the dining room.

2907
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:41,930
What?

2908
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:45,590
Why are you so surprised about that?

2909
02:11:46,210 --> 02:11:47,870
Mom makes the best bacon.

2910
02:11:49,210 --> 02:11:52,070
It's a personal policy of mine to never refuse more bacon.

2911
02:11:52,510 --> 02:11:58,810
What the f- Mom is about to get Sprungtrapped all night- Stop!

2912
02:11:58,810 --> 02:11:59,210
Stop!

2913
02:12:01,870 --> 02:12:03,750
Oh my god, don't!

2914
02:12:07,770 --> 02:12:09,470
Breakfast is on the dining table.

2915
02:12:09,590 --> 02:12:11,570
You should hurry up and eat it before it gets cold.

2916
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:13,190
I'll eat with you tomorrow.

2917
02:12:13,490 --> 02:12:14,950
I have an errand to run before work.

2918
02:12:16,090 --> 02:12:21,170
Jinx tore up my pink fuzzy robe, so I have to take it to a seamstress before it frays too much.

2919
02:12:21,970 --> 02:12:24,570
Something must have spooked her really good last night.

2920
02:12:24,630 --> 02:12:25,270
Poor girl.

2921
02:12:26,250 --> 02:12:26,950
Oh no.

2922
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:28,750
I don't think it was a dream, Bazzi.

2923
02:12:29,670 --> 02:12:32,230
Other than the pizzeria's phone numbers, these notes are gibberish.

2924
02:12:32,410 --> 02:12:34,030
Why are they on your fridge then?

2925
02:12:34,090 --> 02:12:34,350
Oh no!

2926
02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:35,610
That's not where I wanted to go!

2927
02:12:36,030 --> 02:12:36,290
Ah!

2928
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:48,440
This game is so funny!

2929
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:53,340
Maybe I'll skip breakfast tonight.

2930
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:57,180
But your dad wanted to eat with you this morning.

2931
02:12:57,900 --> 02:12:58,340
Mom!

2932
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:02,280
Um, maybe another morning.

2933
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:05,460
Well, don't forget your lunch so you don't starve today.

2934
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:08,860
I think we should eat breakfast with Papa.

2935
02:13:09,620 --> 02:13:10,380
Hello, Dad.

2936
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:15,660
The way he's looking at me.

2937
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:19,860
I'm trying to eat breakfast with you, Dad!

2938
02:13:21,620 --> 02:13:22,240
Okay, bye.

2939
02:13:26,810 --> 02:13:27,290
Cat.

2940
02:13:31,230 --> 02:13:32,050
Anything in here?

2941
02:13:32,870 --> 02:13:35,070
Let's explore a little bit more before we go to school.

2942
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:38,590
Can I put a rat trap down here?

2943
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:41,330
I'm not allowed to mess around with the toolbox.

2944
02:13:41,610 --> 02:13:42,570
Mom's scared I'd hurt myself.

2945
02:13:42,850 --> 02:13:44,730
I'm more scared about the rabbit getting a hold of this.

2946
02:13:47,210 --> 02:13:48,070
Oh, a furnace.

2947
02:13:51,590 --> 02:13:51,990
Cat.

2948
02:13:52,890 --> 02:13:53,690
So we...

2949
02:13:53,690 --> 02:13:58,090
Oh my gosh, we have to bring the ladder from all the way up there to all the way down here!

2950
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:01,370
Okay...

2951
02:14:02,130 --> 02:14:02,950
Okay, okay.

2952
02:14:03,370 --> 02:14:05,770
I do have the rat trap, though.

2953
02:14:07,010 --> 02:14:08,670
Jeff needs to buy more of these.

2954
02:14:16,540 --> 02:14:18,140
I'm not sure how long I'll play today.

2955
02:14:18,460 --> 02:14:20,830
I do have some stuff I need to do later on, so...

2956
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:23,920
Sorry, Dad.

2957
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:26,260
Just a little bit while longer, I guess.

2958
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:28,820
Fancy dishes we only use on holidays.

2959
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:34,400
Dad, you want to play a board game?

2960
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:35,420
Oh, an extra battery!

2961
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:36,400
I'll take it.

2962
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:43,680
What if we had gone in there before we talked to Mom?

2963
02:14:47,540 --> 02:14:48,200
The lunch!

2964
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:49,340
Oh, that's right, my lunch.

2965
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:49,980
Thank you.

2966
02:14:53,420 --> 02:14:54,240
Good morning, Dad!

2967
02:14:57,660 --> 02:14:58,320
My lunch.

2968
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:00,780
Alright.

2969
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:02,220
Go to school.

2970
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:05,740
Bye, Dad!

2971
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:06,480
See you later!

2972
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:07,740
He says...

2973
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:09,100
He says...

2974
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:10,960
See you later, son!

2975
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:12,240
See you later!

2976
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:15,460
What is this?

2977
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:16,920
It looks like that game...

2978
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:17,280
What's it called?

2979
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:17,580
Sorry?

2980
02:15:18,180 --> 02:15:19,080
Minto Lunch?

2981
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:23,320
We still have Zendrelix vs.

2982
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:26,280
Mecha Zendrelix recorded on the DVR.

2983
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:28,940
Wish I could watch it with Dad right now.

2984
02:15:29,380 --> 02:15:29,980
Aww...

2985
02:15:31,940 --> 02:15:32,380
Yeah...

2986
02:15:38,690 --> 02:15:40,070
Oh, Grandma lives nearby.

2987
02:15:40,210 --> 02:15:42,010
My parents didn't want us to move so far away from her.

2988
02:15:42,130 --> 02:15:44,130
One of the reasons we stayed in this dead-end town.

2989
02:15:44,230 --> 02:15:45,970
Just pick up Grandma and take her with you!

2990
02:15:46,870 --> 02:15:48,230
Just literally lift...

2991
02:15:48,230 --> 02:15:49,390
Just pick her up!

2992
02:15:51,410 --> 02:15:51,850
Just...

2993
02:15:51,850 --> 02:15:52,590
Just reach...

2994
02:15:53,650 --> 02:15:55,570
Grab her by the waist and just...

2995
02:15:56,110 --> 02:15:56,550
Yoink!

2996
02:15:56,890 --> 02:15:57,510
You know?

2997
02:15:59,890 --> 02:16:00,610
Have a...

2998
02:16:01,990 --> 02:16:02,830
day, son!

2999
02:16:04,110 --> 02:16:04,590
School!

3000
02:16:09,770 --> 02:16:10,830
School day two.

3001
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:20,820
Look at me.

3002
02:16:21,200 --> 02:16:23,260
I can't stop thinking about that thing.

3003
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:24,420
Oh my God!

3004
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:25,760
The bully is over here!

3005
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:30,040
I wish I could just run away.

3006
02:16:31,580 --> 02:16:32,060
Aww...

3007
02:16:32,060 --> 02:16:32,800
Poor Oswald.

3008
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:34,640
Ugh...

3009
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:36,260
Who could eat lunch at a time like this?

3010
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:37,580
JM!

3011
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:38,660
Look at the membership.

3012
02:16:38,780 --> 02:16:39,260
Thank you!

3013
02:16:39,300 --> 02:16:39,380
Thank you!

3014
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:44,020
You sure that's a good idea, Jet?

3015
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:45,560
Mischievous accomplice.

3016
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:49,580
You can leave if you're gonna be such a chicken.

3017
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:50,520
Wait.

3018
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:52,820
Is that like a TNT?

3019
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:54,760
Is that like a dynamite?

3020
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:57,480
Oh my God.

3021
02:16:57,540 --> 02:16:58,680
They're gonna blow up the school!

3022
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:05,720
Hey, underpaid teacher.

3023
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:07,000
What are these descriptions?

3024
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:08,440
Who did that?

3025
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:09,360
Who did that?

3026
02:17:09,360 --> 02:17:09,660
Run!

3027
02:17:16,350 --> 02:17:17,030
Okay.

3028
02:17:17,450 --> 02:17:19,410
I'm just sad Oswald now.

3029
02:17:20,070 --> 02:17:21,110
Oh, a battery.

3030
02:17:21,270 --> 02:17:22,130
Hope it still has juice.

3031
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:23,690
Teacher!

3032
02:17:24,630 --> 02:17:26,050
She's ignoring me.

3033
02:17:27,630 --> 02:17:28,910
Animal loving student.

3034
02:17:29,150 --> 02:17:31,090
My family has three cats.

3035
02:17:31,690 --> 02:17:32,670
Jealous student.

3036
02:17:33,010 --> 02:17:33,410
Aww.

3037
02:17:33,670 --> 02:17:35,030
I love cats.

3038
02:17:36,270 --> 02:17:37,610
Animal loving student.

3039
02:17:37,790 --> 02:17:39,490
I have two dogs.

3040
02:17:39,890 --> 02:17:40,890
Jealous student.

3041
02:17:41,110 --> 02:17:42,530
I have a rabbit.

3042
02:17:43,970 --> 02:17:44,650
I love cats.

3043
02:17:44,670 --> 02:17:45,530
I hate rabbits.

3044
02:17:45,910 --> 02:17:46,370
Okay.

3045
02:17:46,430 --> 02:17:47,850
Nobody asked you, Oswald.

3046
02:17:48,930 --> 02:17:52,790
You inserted yourself into the conversation to be a little dick.

3047
02:17:52,910 --> 02:17:53,990
Get out of here.

3048
02:17:56,150 --> 02:17:58,310
Wonder if that kid has any more of these.

3049
02:17:58,950 --> 02:17:59,410
Oh.

3050
02:18:01,070 --> 02:18:01,530
Oh.

3051
02:18:02,490 --> 02:18:04,350
Smells like fruit?

3052
02:18:04,470 --> 02:18:05,090
What did he say?

3053
02:18:07,170 --> 02:18:07,630
Wait.

3054
02:18:07,730 --> 02:18:08,070
What did he say?

3055
02:18:08,430 --> 02:18:09,210
Smells like...

3056
02:18:09,210 --> 02:18:09,870
Oh, fresh meat.

3057
02:18:10,830 --> 02:18:11,290
Um.

3058
02:18:11,310 --> 02:18:12,490
That would be my lunch.

3059
02:18:13,690 --> 02:18:14,150
Oswald.

3060
02:18:14,170 --> 02:18:14,650
Oh my God.

3061
02:18:20,010 --> 02:18:21,810
Thank you for the dodo.

3062
02:18:21,970 --> 02:18:25,010
The second story of the book Fazbear Frights 5.

3063
02:18:25,130 --> 02:18:27,190
The main character berates a date for being...

3064
02:18:28,110 --> 02:18:28,670
What?

3065
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:31,370
Afterwards, he starts to blow up himself.

3066
02:18:31,470 --> 02:18:36,910
He feels something moving around inside him and an infanticide springtrap bursts out of his body.

3067
02:18:37,490 --> 02:18:38,810
Not a joke.

3068
02:18:39,810 --> 02:18:40,770
Come on.

3069
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:44,800
Shalashaska.

3070
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:48,580
Oswald the ocelot has forgotten how to eat.

3071
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:55,200
That was like the one thing you could do right.

3072
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:57,440
Clueless lackey.

3073
02:18:57,580 --> 02:18:58,400
Ho, ho, ho.

3074
02:18:58,640 --> 02:18:59,500
Good one, Dylan.

3075
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:03,500
Shooting hoops.

3076
02:19:03,720 --> 02:19:04,200
Now?

3077
02:19:04,640 --> 02:19:05,480
Come on.

3078
02:19:07,500 --> 02:19:09,040
These are so funny.

3079
02:19:11,420 --> 02:19:13,560
There's a kid in the lockers you should talk to.

3080
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:16,320
Does he...

3081
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:17,720
Is he like a programmer?

3082
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:18,560
A housekeeper?

3083
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:18,700
A hacker?

3084
02:19:20,660 --> 02:19:21,600
Settle down, class.

3085
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:24,260
Remember the bell has to ring before you are...

3086
02:19:26,980 --> 02:19:27,420
Dismissed.

3087
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:29,040
Thanks, Teach.

3088
02:19:30,460 --> 02:19:31,700
Teacher, I don't want to go home.

3089
02:19:33,060 --> 02:19:33,500
Yes?

3090
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:34,660
Did you need something, Oswald?

3091
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:35,860
Oh, it's Miss Meecham.

3092
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:36,800
Mrs. Meecham.

3093
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:41,240
I need...

3094
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:42,880
No.

3095
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:44,800
Nothing, Mrs. Meecham.

3096
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:45,740
Sorry.

3097
02:19:51,330 --> 02:19:51,770
Wait.

3098
02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:52,430
But...

3099
02:19:54,030 --> 02:19:56,810
In the past, wasn't she just Miss Meecham?

3100
02:19:57,550 --> 02:19:59,930
Did she not take the... the last name?

3101
02:20:01,230 --> 02:20:02,210
Hi, family.

3102
02:20:02,410 --> 02:20:03,510
Oh, reminiscing student.

3103
02:20:03,730 --> 02:20:06,730
My family used to go to the roller rink after the first day of school.

3104
02:20:07,510 --> 02:20:08,450
Disappointed student.

3105
02:20:08,710 --> 02:20:10,130
At least you got to go.

3106
02:20:10,430 --> 02:20:13,450
I'll never get to go now that it's gone.

3107
02:20:15,130 --> 02:20:15,690
Eh.

3108
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:19,510
I'd much rather sit at home and play some Field Forge, anyway.

3109
02:20:20,890 --> 02:20:21,810
I think you've got it.

3110
02:20:21,810 --> 02:20:24,510
You mean start on my Washington Irving essay, don't you?

3111
02:20:25,330 --> 02:20:26,630
Stop eavesdropping, teacher.

3112
02:20:26,830 --> 02:20:27,470
It's not cool.

3113
02:20:30,930 --> 02:20:32,010
What is this music?

3114
02:20:33,790 --> 02:20:37,310
I can't believe we actually did work on the first day of school.

3115
02:20:37,990 --> 02:20:39,370
I love Field Forge.

3116
02:20:39,470 --> 02:20:40,450
Oh, it's Minecraft.

3117
02:20:40,950 --> 02:20:41,710
You're right.

3118
02:20:42,550 --> 02:20:43,330
Block game.

3119
02:20:44,710 --> 02:20:45,210
Huh?

3120
02:20:45,350 --> 02:20:46,370
We did work today?

3121
02:20:47,530 --> 02:20:50,030
The smoothness of the pixel art hurts my soul.

3122
02:20:50,210 --> 02:20:50,650
What do you mean?

3123
02:20:50,870 --> 02:20:51,610
I don't mind...

3124
02:20:51,610 --> 02:20:51,790
I don't mind...

3125
02:20:51,790 --> 02:20:53,130
I like it, actually.

3126
02:20:56,370 --> 02:21:00,030
I don't mind when some pixel art games are kind of smooth like this, you know?

3127
02:21:00,530 --> 02:21:02,010
A back-to-school poster.

3128
02:21:02,210 --> 02:21:04,770
The final nail in the coffin for summer vacation.

3129
02:21:05,930 --> 02:21:07,330
I kind of like the stylization.

3130
02:21:10,030 --> 02:21:16,230
But if you're like, I don't know, a pixel purist, I guess, it's not, you know, what maybe wouldn't be your cup of tea.

3131
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:19,030
Looks like there's a pep rally on Friday.

3132
02:21:19,030 --> 02:21:20,570
Should be really fun.

3133
02:21:21,550 --> 02:21:22,470
A pep rally?

3134
02:21:23,450 --> 02:21:25,230
Is he not in, like, elementary school?

3135
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:27,650
Find the kid with the firecracker.

3136
02:21:28,250 --> 02:21:29,850
Hey, you're the firecracker kid!

3137
02:21:32,530 --> 02:21:34,670
Sorry, I was reading the objective.

3138
02:21:35,970 --> 02:21:36,830
I didn't...

3139
02:21:49,690 --> 02:21:52,530
The name's Jet, but that has a nice ring to it, too.

3140
02:21:53,670 --> 02:21:55,110
Do you have any more I could borrow?

3141
02:21:55,750 --> 02:21:58,230
First off, kid, you can't just borrow a firecracker.

3142
02:21:58,490 --> 02:22:00,430
They're kind of one-time use only.

3143
02:22:01,150 --> 02:22:02,910
Okay, then can you give me one?

3144
02:22:04,050 --> 02:22:06,290
Do you have any idea what these things cost?

3145
02:22:08,190 --> 02:22:08,890
Tell you what.

3146
02:22:08,970 --> 02:22:09,570
Actually, hold on.

3147
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:11,630
Let me check Discord real quick because I do have some stuff.

3148
02:22:12,150 --> 02:22:12,550
Okay.

3149
02:22:17,020 --> 02:22:20,800
What I mean is as a pixel artist, I could only imagine how ungodly long it took.

3150
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:21,040
Oh!

3151
02:22:22,360 --> 02:22:23,160
Okay, that...

3152
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:23,680
Yes.

3153
02:22:25,960 --> 02:22:27,560
That I totally understand.

3154
02:22:27,700 --> 02:22:29,120
Look at these twins just walking around.

3155
02:22:30,100 --> 02:22:30,800
Oh, my gosh.

3156
02:22:31,300 --> 02:22:32,000
Close enough.

3157
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,160
Welcome back, Fuwamoko.

3158
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:42,580
Discord has a streamer mode.

3159
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:45,520
I know, but for some reason, it wasn't turning on.

3160
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:49,620
I'm usually at the library after school.

3161
02:22:49,860 --> 02:22:51,440
Bring me something I couldn't get anywhere else.

3162
02:22:51,580 --> 02:22:52,660
Maybe we can trade.

3163
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:53,980
Okay.

3164
02:22:54,340 --> 02:22:54,740
Something...

3165
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:56,980
Oh, my objective is to go home.

3166
02:22:58,020 --> 02:22:58,700
Oh, my God.

3167
02:22:58,760 --> 02:22:59,680
I drew a picture of my dad.

3168
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:04,880
Have you checked out the new game, Wrestle Quest?

3169
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:07,800
My dad was telling me all about the different wrestlers.

3170
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:11,160
I didn't know much about wrestling going in, but I do now.

3171
02:23:12,480 --> 02:23:13,280
Oh, see.

3172
02:23:14,700 --> 02:23:15,720
What the...

3173
02:23:19,730 --> 02:23:23,170
I overheard the janitor talking to his mom this afternoon.

3174
02:23:24,370 --> 02:23:28,330
Must be possessed by a really tidy ghost.

3175
02:23:30,390 --> 02:23:31,170
Observant student.

3176
02:23:32,350 --> 02:23:36,570
You wouldn't happen to mean a ghost maid, right?

3177
02:23:38,430 --> 02:23:39,510
You wouldn't...

3178
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:39,790
You...

3179
02:23:40,710 --> 02:23:41,270
You...

3180
02:23:41,270 --> 02:23:41,630
You...

3181
02:23:42,250 --> 02:23:42,810
What

3182
02:23:48,210 --> 02:23:49,590
a ghost maid, huh?

3183
02:23:53,890 --> 02:23:54,450
Mint...

3184
02:23:54,450 --> 02:23:56,450
Mint in FNAF?

3185
02:23:56,910 --> 02:23:57,470
Real?

3186
02:23:57,750 --> 02:23:58,230
Oh, my God.

3187
02:23:58,250 --> 02:23:58,890
That girl scared me.

3188
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:04,520
Does he know?

3189
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:07,380
This game was made for you.

3190
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,720
I'm losing my mind right now.

3191
02:24:11,380 --> 02:24:13,940
I have a brilliant idea for a school talent show.

3192
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:16,900
A synchronized water balloon fight performance.

3193
02:24:17,180 --> 02:24:17,900
It'll be epic.

3194
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:20,040
Wow, sounds intense.

3195
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:21,420
Why water balloons?

3196
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:23,740
Because we're not allowed to use real bombs.

3197
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:26,060
Why not water balloons?

3198
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:27,400
Touché.

3199
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:31,880
Is this the bathroom?

3200
02:24:32,120 --> 02:24:32,460
Nope.

3201
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:33,680
What do you got to say?

3202
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:36,220
You won't believe what happened in science class today.

3203
02:24:36,400 --> 02:24:39,940
We tried to make a volcano model and it exploded all over the teacher.

3204
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:43,800
I really made the class erupt with laughter.

3205
02:24:45,140 --> 02:24:45,820
Ha...

3206
02:24:45,820 --> 02:24:46,640
Ha...

3207
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:47,000
Ha...

3208
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:47,700
Ha...

3209
02:24:48,380 --> 02:24:49,060
Ha...

3210
02:24:49,060 --> 02:24:49,200
Ha...

3211
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:51,740
Nothing divided in half is nothing.

3212
02:24:52,900 --> 02:24:54,380
Probably a math textbook.

3213
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:55,240
Okay.

3214
02:24:58,660 --> 02:24:59,960
Divide by zero.

3215
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,080
Voucher validator.

3216
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:05,620
Okay, cool.

3217
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:08,020
So there is stuff in here as well for the...

3218
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:11,300
For the machines.

3219
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:15,780
What is something that is...

3220
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:16,700
He...

3221
02:25:16,700 --> 02:25:17,180
Oh my gosh.

3222
02:25:17,420 --> 02:25:18,000
A box.

3223
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:20,320
Something that he wouldn't be able to get.

3224
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:22,920
I know I have to go home but...

3225
02:25:24,020 --> 02:25:25,640
I want to look around as well.

3226
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,040
We need more trophies than the high school's team.

3227
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:29,160
Oh, sorry.

3228
02:25:29,300 --> 02:25:31,360
We have more trophies than the high school's team.

3229
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:33,580
Yeah, they're for kickball but still.

3230
02:25:37,670 --> 02:25:40,350
Dylan's pulled this once and they had to evacuate the entire school.

3231
02:25:40,550 --> 02:25:41,950
He got in so much trouble.

3232
02:25:42,510 --> 02:25:43,190
Mm-hmm.

3233
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:43,750
Mm-hmm.

3234
02:25:44,490 --> 02:25:46,570
I won't be sharing any of my new sketches anymore.

3235
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:48,570
Don't want to see those monsters at school.

3236
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:51,290
How does he know what they are though, you know?

3237
02:25:51,630 --> 02:25:53,990
God, the children sometimes look so scary.

3238
02:25:54,650 --> 02:25:55,910
Like, look at her.

3239
02:25:55,970 --> 02:25:57,370
Her eyes are just...

3240
02:25:57,370 --> 02:25:59,550
There's not a thought behind that brain.

3241
02:26:01,110 --> 02:26:03,370
I mean, there's not a thought in that brain.

3242
02:26:05,910 --> 02:26:08,930
Please cheer us on in the regional volleyball tournament.

3243
02:26:10,190 --> 02:26:12,050
I know we can win it all this year.

3244
02:26:13,010 --> 02:26:13,450
Wow.

3245
02:26:14,350 --> 02:26:15,150
Oh my gosh.

3246
02:26:15,370 --> 02:26:16,110
Ghost made.

3247
02:26:21,350 --> 02:26:22,130
Fish eyes.

3248
02:26:22,290 --> 02:26:23,170
No soul.

3249
02:26:23,790 --> 02:26:24,510
Mr. Principal!

3250
02:26:25,050 --> 02:26:26,730
Okay, I can just go into your office?

3251
02:26:27,710 --> 02:26:29,750
If I squint, I can see my house from here.

3252
02:26:33,050 --> 02:26:34,550
I used to do that every time.

3253
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:35,630
Anytime I would...

3254
02:26:35,630 --> 02:26:37,290
Even if I was like...

3255
02:26:38,130 --> 02:26:39,630
on the other side of the country.

3256
02:26:39,870 --> 02:26:41,250
If I went on a tall place...

3257
02:26:41,630 --> 02:26:42,830
I would be like...

3258
02:26:42,830 --> 02:26:42,990
Haha!

3259
02:26:43,290 --> 02:26:44,590
I can see my house from here!

3260
02:26:46,130 --> 02:26:47,050
What's with the timer?

3261
02:26:47,090 --> 02:26:47,830
Is this a speed run?

3262
02:26:48,090 --> 02:26:48,450
No!

3263
02:26:48,670 --> 02:26:50,310
I just keep forgetting to turn it off.

3264
02:26:50,510 --> 02:26:53,170
But also, it's helping me keep track of how long I've been playing, so...

3265
02:26:53,170 --> 02:26:54,490
Actually, I kind of don't mind it.

3266
02:26:55,050 --> 02:26:56,390
A framed article...

3267
02:26:56,890 --> 02:26:57,850
from the school newspaper.

3268
02:26:58,230 --> 02:27:00,350
The headline is about the time we won a kickball tournament.

3269
02:27:05,740 --> 02:27:08,600
Speed running a game for the first time sounds...

3270
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:09,060
crazy.

3271
02:27:10,320 --> 02:27:11,000
Nothing useful.

3272
02:27:11,140 --> 02:27:11,700
Just garbage.

3273
02:27:17,820 --> 02:27:19,280
Is there anything else in the backpack I could use?

3274
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:22,080
Are you still a jealous student?

3275
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:23,860
An animal-loving student?

3276
02:27:24,060 --> 02:27:24,240
Yes.

3277
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:25,680
Okay.

3278
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:27,100
What about you?

3279
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:28,000
Oh.

3280
02:27:28,340 --> 02:27:29,060
Athletic student?

3281
02:27:30,320 --> 02:27:30,800
Basketball?

3282
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:32,220
At a time like this?

3283
02:27:33,860 --> 02:27:34,540
Froggy chair!

3284
02:27:34,980 --> 02:27:35,780
Welcome to membership!

3285
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:36,500
Thank you!

3286
02:27:37,860 --> 02:27:38,340
Okay.

3287
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:40,380
This is world record pace.

3288
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:41,100
I think you're right.

3289
02:27:44,570 --> 02:27:45,050
Oh.

3290
02:27:45,930 --> 02:27:48,850
How about you read a book on how not to be a loser?

3291
02:27:50,370 --> 02:27:50,870
Ha!

3292
02:27:52,290 --> 02:27:53,210
Come on, guys.

3293
02:27:53,290 --> 02:27:55,250
Let's stop wasting time on this nerd.

3294
02:27:56,910 --> 02:27:58,150
Are you okay, nerd?

3295
02:27:58,690 --> 02:27:59,530
Little nerd?

3296
02:28:00,430 --> 02:28:01,790
Are you okay, little nerd?

3297
02:28:02,750 --> 02:28:03,750
Don't listen to them.

3298
02:28:03,930 --> 02:28:05,990
Dylan's just jealous because you know how to read.

3299
02:28:13,850 --> 02:28:14,350
Damn!

3300
02:28:15,350 --> 02:28:15,850
Ozzy!

3301
02:28:18,010 --> 02:28:18,510
No!

3302
02:28:21,570 --> 02:28:23,390
He's just jealous because he knows how to read.

3303
02:28:24,990 --> 02:28:25,430
Haha.

3304
02:28:25,530 --> 02:28:26,090
Thank you.

3305
02:28:26,190 --> 02:28:28,770
The bullies picked on me for reading at my old school, too.

3306
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:30,370
Well, then.

3307
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:31,570
They must be pretty stupid.

3308
02:28:32,450 --> 02:28:34,050
I read a ton of sci-fi.

3309
02:28:34,170 --> 02:28:35,090
What are you reading?

3310
02:28:36,050 --> 02:28:37,290
Ancient Greek mythology.

3311
02:28:38,310 --> 02:28:38,750
Oh.

3312
02:28:38,830 --> 02:28:39,230
Uh.

3313
02:28:39,510 --> 02:28:41,310
I've been meaning to get around to that one.

3314
02:28:41,950 --> 02:28:42,390
Okay.

3315
02:28:42,830 --> 02:28:43,890
Ozwell with the Riz.

3316
02:28:43,890 --> 02:28:44,150
Okay.

3317
02:28:44,710 --> 02:28:45,150
Haha.

3318
02:28:45,310 --> 02:28:47,270
It's not much different from science fiction, really.

3319
02:28:48,050 --> 02:28:48,490
Oh.

3320
02:28:48,490 --> 02:28:51,370
It's all about being brave during impossible situations.

3321
02:28:52,970 --> 02:28:54,590
She's a Percy Jackson kid.

3322
02:28:57,810 --> 02:28:58,750
I could never get...

3323
02:28:58,750 --> 02:28:59,770
I was a maze runner kid.

3324
02:28:59,990 --> 02:29:00,310
You know?

3325
02:29:00,350 --> 02:29:01,370
Couldn't get into Percy Jackson.

3326
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:09,420
Hmm.

3327
02:29:10,380 --> 02:29:14,520
Well, if you ever want to read something with pictures, I'd be happy to lend you a comic.

3328
02:29:19,020 --> 02:29:19,420
Oh.

3329
02:29:19,580 --> 02:29:22,300
If you like art, maybe you'll actually have a use for this thing.

3330
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:22,500
Sorry.

3331
02:29:22,580 --> 02:29:23,800
I'm like eating my corn soup.

3332
02:29:26,880 --> 02:29:27,320
No.

3333
02:29:28,600 --> 02:29:31,100
I actually have not seen the maze runner movies yet.

3334
02:29:31,660 --> 02:29:32,380
Maybe I should.

3335
02:29:34,900 --> 02:29:35,340
Kubo.

3336
02:29:35,620 --> 02:29:36,680
Thanks for four months.

3337
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:37,360
Thank you.

3338
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:37,820
Choo choo.

3339
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:39,160
Cowabunga.

3340
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:41,100
I was a Top Gun kid.

3341
02:29:41,500 --> 02:29:41,700
Haha.

3342
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:46,040
There's a certain NPC in the school that has like some special dog dialogue that you might like.

3343
02:29:46,360 --> 02:29:49,760
I don't know where it is or what day it's on, but...

3344
02:29:50,280 --> 02:29:50,720
Shark.

3345
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:54,360
Shark.

3346
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:55,960
Okay.

3347
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:56,380
Okay.

3348
02:29:56,380 --> 02:29:56,780
Okay.

3349
02:29:58,620 --> 02:30:02,760
I think I went through all the rooms that I could, so maybe it's a different day.

3350
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:06,700
I was helping my grandpa clear out some junk yesterday and found his old sketchbook.

3351
02:30:07,320 --> 02:30:08,800
There's some neat drawings in there.

3352
02:30:08,860 --> 02:30:09,120
Uh-oh.

3353
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:10,760
It's going to be a Freddy Fazbear.

3354
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:12,380
Freddy Fazbear jump scare.

3355
02:30:16,540 --> 02:30:17,560
Oh my gosh.

3356
02:30:17,580 --> 02:30:18,440
It said it's Chica.

3357
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:18,920
Wait.

3358
02:30:19,020 --> 02:30:20,840
Your grandpa is...

3359
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:24,040
Your grandpa is William Afton.

3360
02:30:24,520 --> 02:30:26,440
Why is she starting to smell bad?

3361
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:26,780
I don't know.

3362
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:33,460
Excuse me?

3363
02:30:35,540 --> 02:30:36,520
Excuse me?

3364
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:40,900
Why is she starting to smell bad?

3365
02:30:42,100 --> 02:30:43,320
What is that smell?

3366
02:30:44,680 --> 02:30:46,720
Tech 2 noticed the smell, too.

3367
02:30:47,580 --> 02:30:49,100
It's not just me.

3368
02:30:49,980 --> 02:30:50,540
What?

3369
02:30:56,750 --> 02:30:59,150
Why is she starting to smell bad, you guys?

3370
02:31:01,370 --> 02:31:02,850
Company issue number 85.

3371
02:31:02,970 --> 02:31:03,970
Inner torso repairs.

3372
02:31:04,530 --> 02:31:05,710
Investigations are to be delayed.

3373
02:31:05,910 --> 02:31:07,190
No eating around Chica.

3374
02:31:08,250 --> 02:31:09,130
No behavior.

3375
02:31:09,410 --> 02:31:09,670
August.

3376
02:31:09,910 --> 02:31:11,490
Chica is making garbage nests.

3377
02:31:11,790 --> 02:31:16,010
Make employees aware all garbage needs to be taken out before closing.

3378
02:31:16,390 --> 02:31:18,050
Why is she so sentient?

3379
02:31:18,350 --> 02:31:21,670
Disable smelling protocol during daytime to avoid Chica stealing food.

3380
02:31:21,970 --> 02:31:24,150
Kids cry if they see the endo mouth.

3381
02:31:24,330 --> 02:31:24,450
Oh.

3382
02:31:25,010 --> 02:31:27,410
Do not attempt to play Bonnie's guitar.

3383
02:31:27,750 --> 02:31:30,930
Any voice box malfunctions must be reported to upper management.

3384
02:31:31,750 --> 02:31:32,650
Adjust hug.

3385
02:31:32,810 --> 02:31:32,950
I'm sorry.

3386
02:31:32,950 --> 02:31:34,770
Fractured a kid's back again?

3387
02:31:35,590 --> 02:31:36,930
How many times has it been?

3388
02:31:37,150 --> 02:31:38,250
Why is that even a protocol?

3389
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:39,350
Adjusting.

3390
02:31:39,350 --> 02:31:39,810
Yet again.

3391
02:31:40,470 --> 02:31:41,030
Whoa.

3392
02:31:43,070 --> 02:31:44,310
Glue hat to head.

3393
02:31:44,490 --> 02:31:45,690
Kids keep stealing it.

3394
02:31:45,970 --> 02:31:47,450
Uppers don't care about safety.

3395
02:31:48,070 --> 02:31:50,690
Jaws are still unpredictable with the new models.

3396
02:31:50,930 --> 02:31:52,930
Why does he keep screaming?

3397
02:31:56,730 --> 02:31:59,830
Keep bright flashes away from Freddy's sight.

3398
02:32:00,450 --> 02:32:02,930
Sends him into a frenzy and blows him away.

3399
02:32:02,930 --> 02:32:03,550
Close the circuits.

3400
02:32:03,810 --> 02:32:05,170
No camera flashes.

3401
02:32:15,210 --> 02:32:18,930
So if I see the Freddy animatronic, I should flash my flashlight.

3402
02:32:20,430 --> 02:32:21,770
Is what I'm getting.

3403
02:32:21,950 --> 02:32:29,970
I don't know quite what the Bonnie one means, but the Chica one, I...

3404
02:32:29,970 --> 02:32:32,810
So I have to not have food?

3405
02:32:36,130 --> 02:32:38,390
Remember the dark eyes are watching.

3406
02:32:38,710 --> 02:32:39,270
Okay.

3407
02:32:39,350 --> 02:32:40,710
So if I'm in the dark.

3408
02:32:40,710 --> 02:32:42,270
That's when I'm in trouble around Freddy.

3409
02:32:42,610 --> 02:32:46,250
AI programming causing Freddy to stalk partygoers by guarding doors.

3410
02:32:46,590 --> 02:32:47,850
Tech 2 is on assignment.

3411
02:32:48,150 --> 02:32:49,570
Tech 2 knows something.

3412
02:32:49,810 --> 02:32:50,450
Where is he?

3413
02:32:50,730 --> 02:32:52,990
Freddy keeps trying to remove his own head.

3414
02:32:54,970 --> 02:32:56,450
Tech 2 on assignment.

3415
02:32:56,950 --> 02:32:57,530
No...

3416
02:32:57,530 --> 02:32:57,910
No...

3417
02:32:58,520 --> 02:32:59,470
No raves?

3418
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:04,540
Freddy is a little...

3419
02:33:04,540 --> 02:33:05,000
Huh?

3420
02:33:05,260 --> 02:33:07,520
Tech pulled fifth no-show in a row.

3421
02:33:07,980 --> 02:33:08,960
Note for later.

3422
02:33:10,660 --> 02:33:13,880
Random stuff starts to appear in places it doesn't belong.

3423
02:33:14,120 --> 02:33:15,620
Encourage others to be vigilant.

3424
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:16,880
This is a health code violation.

3425
02:33:18,900 --> 02:33:20,640
Not that the uppers care.

3426
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:22,700
Tech 2 slacking.

3427
02:33:22,700 --> 02:33:23,480
I know, right?

3428
02:33:24,460 --> 02:33:28,240
More random stuff appears and everything begins to form in a circular pile.

3429
02:33:28,760 --> 02:33:33,200
The pile is clearly formed with an intent... with an indent in the center.

3430
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:36,620
Chica will bring stolen food to the pile and eat it.

3431
02:33:36,720 --> 02:33:38,940
Oh, maybe that's how you destroy the food.

3432
02:33:38,960 --> 02:33:42,180
She will distract her by leaving food or something and then she takes it and goes eat it.

3433
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:46,500
Recent security update fried the AI.

3434
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:52,260
Wait, so are we going to have to watch out for Chica, Freddy, Bonnie, and Springtrap all at the same time?

3435
02:33:52,680 --> 02:33:54,960
These locations are not that big.

3436
02:33:56,600 --> 02:33:58,520
Recent security update fried the AI.

3437
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:03,560
Chica stuck in preservation protocol as a self-soothing mechanism at night during security rounds.

3438
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:04,440
It bites.

3439
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:05,760
Keep fingers away.

3440
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:07,040
Tech 2 missing?

3441
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:09,520
Maybe this should be in bigger font.

3442
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:14,640
Someone got into the Cupcake's voice box and programmed it to growl.

3443
02:34:14,840 --> 02:34:16,740
Tech 2 has been asked to investigate.

3444
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:17,720
Tech 2 is missing!

3445
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:20,160
Stuff on the guitars.

3446
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:21,660
New guitar model.

3447
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:23,720
It's 4v1.

3448
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:24,400
No!

3449
02:34:27,260 --> 02:34:29,280
Bonnie's strings now break at least once a week.

3450
02:34:29,380 --> 02:34:32,380
Change them even if they are still intact to avoid snapping on stage.

3451
02:34:39,980 --> 02:34:41,120
Save old ones as backup.

3452
02:34:42,820 --> 02:34:46,340
Helper management requested all old strings to be dumped off-site due to pending lawsuit.

3453
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:48,020
Tech 2...

3454
02:34:48,020 --> 02:34:48,140
What?

3455
02:34:48,180 --> 02:34:49,200
Just use, like, string.

3456
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:52,480
Tech 2 was asked to dump them all by the...

3457
02:34:52,480 --> 02:34:54,420
Oh, at the mill by EOD.

3458
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:55,580
End of day.

3459
02:34:56,200 --> 02:34:58,600
Probably don't want to get sued after electrocution incident.

3460
02:34:58,840 --> 02:34:59,300
Poor kid.

3461
02:34:59,440 --> 02:35:00,140
Oh my god.

3462
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:03,760
Detailed animatronic eye diagram.

3463
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:04,480
Cool.

3464
02:35:04,860 --> 02:35:05,800
Detailed layer...

3465
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:06,840
Suit layer diagram.

3466
02:35:07,240 --> 02:35:07,720
Cool.

3467
02:35:12,300 --> 02:35:13,320
Some little stickers.

3468
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:16,600
Okay.

3469
02:35:16,880 --> 02:35:17,620
This is Freddy.

3470
02:35:19,700 --> 02:35:20,600
What is this one?

3471
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:22,000
Bonnie?

3472
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:22,560
Maybe?

3473
02:35:29,690 --> 02:35:30,410
No way.

3474
02:35:31,790 --> 02:35:33,630
He used to be some kind of technician.

3475
02:35:34,010 --> 02:35:36,050
So they're just doodles and notes from his old job.

3476
02:35:36,210 --> 02:35:37,670
He didn't want to talk about it, though.

3477
02:35:38,510 --> 02:35:41,390
I was supposed to throw it away, but I didn't want to waste the paper, you know?

3478
02:35:42,970 --> 02:35:43,330
Haha.

3479
02:35:43,550 --> 02:35:43,910
Yeah.

3480
02:35:44,810 --> 02:35:46,090
I'm Gabriel, by the way.

3481
02:35:47,630 --> 02:35:48,350
Or Gabrielle.

3482
02:35:48,710 --> 02:35:49,070
Wait.

3483
02:35:49,510 --> 02:35:49,870
Gabrielle?

3484
02:35:50,270 --> 02:35:50,630
No.

3485
02:35:50,630 --> 02:35:51,930
I'm Oswald.

3486
02:35:52,150 --> 02:35:55,690
This is an interesting sketchbook, Gabrielle.

3487
02:35:56,630 --> 02:35:57,150
Thanks.

3488
02:35:59,710 --> 02:36:00,230
Okay.

3489
02:36:01,950 --> 02:36:04,190
Put that sketchbook to good use.

3490
02:36:05,130 --> 02:36:05,970
Thank you.

3491
02:36:07,250 --> 02:36:08,250
See you.

3492
02:36:10,070 --> 02:36:10,590
Wait.

3493
02:36:10,690 --> 02:36:11,910
If we go to the middle...

3494
02:36:15,980 --> 02:36:17,580
Do you think we can find stuff here?

3495
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:21,040
Gabrielle.

3496
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:22,880
Oh my god.

3497
02:36:22,920 --> 02:36:23,120
Look.

3498
02:36:23,720 --> 02:36:25,400
It's the little thing that we couldn't tell...

3499
02:36:25,400 --> 02:36:25,960
I couldn't tell...

3500
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:26,320
Oh my gosh.

3501
02:36:26,360 --> 02:36:26,700
There's...

3502
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:29,200
Lots of...

3503
02:36:30,340 --> 02:36:35,160
Someone made, like, FNAF OCs and just dumped them all here.

3504
02:36:36,260 --> 02:36:36,660
Yuck.

3505
02:36:36,660 --> 02:36:38,680
Pretty certain this trash has been here since the mill closed.

3506
02:36:38,780 --> 02:36:39,140
Yeah.

3507
02:36:39,660 --> 02:36:41,160
The mill closed down three years ago.

3508
02:36:45,310 --> 02:36:46,790
Those are from FNAF 6.

3509
02:36:47,530 --> 02:36:48,310
Trash and the gang?

3510
02:36:48,610 --> 02:36:49,010
Wait.

3511
02:36:49,050 --> 02:36:51,670
Are those actual FNAF characters?

3512
02:36:54,130 --> 02:36:54,530
Hahaha.

3513
02:36:55,190 --> 02:36:55,350
Wait.

3514
02:36:55,450 --> 02:36:55,870
They're actually...

3515
02:36:55,870 --> 02:36:56,190
Hold on.

3516
02:36:58,350 --> 02:37:00,330
They're actual FNAF characters?

3517
02:37:00,570 --> 02:37:01,270
That's so cute.

3518
02:37:02,430 --> 02:37:03,530
They're the trash gang.

3519
02:37:03,870 --> 02:37:04,070
Oh.

3520
02:37:06,770 --> 02:37:07,210
Hi.

3521
02:37:07,350 --> 02:37:07,610
Oh.

3522
02:37:07,650 --> 02:37:07,830
Wow.

3523
02:37:08,830 --> 02:37:09,590
What do you know?

3524
02:37:10,110 --> 02:37:11,210
Show me your kitty.

3525
02:37:11,470 --> 02:37:12,450
Thanks for the fine kitty.

3526
02:37:13,010 --> 02:37:13,450
Thank...

3527
02:37:13,450 --> 02:37:13,610
Oh.

3528
02:37:13,630 --> 02:37:13,930
My bad.

3529
02:37:13,990 --> 02:37:14,650
Thank you.

3530
02:37:15,510 --> 02:37:16,150
All right.

3531
02:37:17,810 --> 02:37:18,450
Let's see.

3532
02:37:18,570 --> 02:37:19,730
I know we have to go home.

3533
02:37:20,370 --> 02:37:22,270
But he did say meet at the library.

3534
02:37:22,810 --> 02:37:23,150
Okay.

3535
02:37:24,730 --> 02:37:25,170
Okay.

3536
02:37:25,170 --> 02:37:26,670
Let's just see what's at the library.

3537
02:37:31,240 --> 02:37:31,760
Hmm.

3538
02:37:32,740 --> 02:37:34,080
It's starting to get dark out.

3539
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:35,580
Uh-oh.

3540
02:37:36,860 --> 02:37:38,820
Dad gets a little funky at night.

3541
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:41,040
Okay.

3542
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:42,140
The kid's not even here.

3543
02:37:42,220 --> 02:37:42,760
What a liar.

3544
02:37:48,180 --> 02:37:48,700
Okay.

3545
02:37:48,700 --> 02:37:49,620
I's Walt's house.

3546
02:37:50,760 --> 02:37:51,280
Okay.

3547
02:37:51,300 --> 02:37:52,280
I's Walt's house.

3548
02:37:58,160 --> 02:37:58,680
Okay.

3549
02:37:58,780 --> 02:37:59,420
I'm home.

3550
02:37:59,800 --> 02:38:00,320
Oh.

3551
02:38:00,360 --> 02:38:00,380
I'm home.

3552
02:38:00,380 --> 02:38:00,500
Oh.

3553
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:01,140
Oh, my God.

3554
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:01,680
Oh, my God.

3555
02:38:10,120 --> 02:38:10,920
Night two.

3556
02:38:14,540 --> 02:38:15,140
All right.

3557
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:16,460
Time to go back to Jeff's.

3558
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:17,960
I think I have a plan now.

3559
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:20,540
Got to get out of here first.

3560
02:38:23,480 --> 02:38:24,980
Find a way to escape.

3561
02:38:27,740 --> 02:38:28,740
I think so.

3562
02:38:29,580 --> 02:38:30,800
I might call it here.

3563
02:38:30,840 --> 02:38:31,860
I know it's a little bit early.

3564
02:38:33,740 --> 02:38:35,380
But next time, I will...

3565
02:38:35,860 --> 02:38:36,260
Oh.

3566
02:38:36,360 --> 02:38:41,000
I'm going to wake up earlier and play through every...

3567
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:42,340
Actually, I don't know.

3568
02:38:42,620 --> 02:38:43,280
Hold on.

3569
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:44,960
Let me see what time my meeting's at.

3570
02:39:03,610 --> 02:39:06,510
I can't remember if my meeting is...

3571
02:39:06,510 --> 02:39:07,130
Oh.

3572
02:39:09,110 --> 02:39:09,890
One second.

3573
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:11,670
What time it's at.

3574
02:39:11,770 --> 02:39:12,450
I can't remember.

3575
02:39:16,170 --> 02:39:16,650
Oh.

3576
02:39:16,910 --> 02:39:17,390
Oh.

3577
02:39:17,490 --> 02:39:18,010
Never mind.

3578
02:39:18,130 --> 02:39:19,010
I have more time than I thought.

3579
02:39:19,150 --> 02:39:19,630
Okay.

3580
02:39:19,630 --> 02:39:20,790
I can go, like, another hour.

3581
02:39:21,050 --> 02:39:21,330
Okay.

3582
02:39:21,390 --> 02:39:21,530
Cool.

3583
02:39:21,610 --> 02:39:21,690
Cool.

3584
02:39:21,730 --> 02:39:21,830
Cool.

3585
02:39:21,870 --> 02:39:21,950
Cool.

3586
02:39:21,950 --> 02:39:22,390
Never mind.

3587
02:39:22,630 --> 02:39:23,130
Don't leave.

3588
02:39:24,150 --> 02:39:24,710
Don't leave.

3589
02:39:27,650 --> 02:39:29,050
I can go, like, another hour.

3590
02:39:29,430 --> 02:39:29,870
All right.

3591
02:39:30,550 --> 02:39:33,750
So, we're going to have to go get the ladder.

3592
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:38,800
Uh-oh.

3593
02:39:38,860 --> 02:39:39,140
Wait.

3594
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:39,900
I think I just heard him.

3595
02:39:44,980 --> 02:39:45,260
Oh.

3596
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:47,080
Okay.

3597
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:48,520
I got to turn up the volume a little bit.

3598
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:49,280
Okay.

3599
02:39:53,230 --> 02:39:53,870
Oh, I hear him.

3600
02:39:54,990 --> 02:39:55,890
He's on the left side.

3601
02:39:57,150 --> 02:39:57,430
Cool.

3602
02:39:59,850 --> 02:40:00,690
I got it.

3603
02:40:00,770 --> 02:40:01,190
I got it.

3604
02:40:01,230 --> 02:40:01,590
I got it.

3605
02:40:02,870 --> 02:40:03,810
I got it.

3606
02:40:04,290 --> 02:40:04,730
I got it.

3607
02:40:04,730 --> 02:40:05,430
Get out of here.

3608
02:40:13,430 --> 02:40:16,090
Mom let Mint use the computer for another hour.

3609
02:40:19,870 --> 02:40:20,610
Woo hoo.

3610
02:40:23,270 --> 02:40:23,710
Yeah.

3611
02:40:24,590 --> 02:40:26,090
Of course, it's boarded up.

3612
02:40:26,170 --> 02:40:27,410
I don't know what I actually did on that.

3613
02:40:27,410 --> 02:40:27,730
Unexpected.

3614
02:40:28,410 --> 02:40:29,110
Dang it.

3615
02:40:30,010 --> 02:40:31,010
So rude.

3616
02:40:31,690 --> 02:40:33,270
How do I get this ladder downstairs?

3617
02:40:34,030 --> 02:40:34,890
Oh, a ladder!

3618
02:40:38,850 --> 02:40:39,490
Oh god.

3619
02:40:39,590 --> 02:40:39,890
Oh god.

3620
02:40:40,070 --> 02:40:40,730
Oh god.

3621
02:40:43,270 --> 02:40:44,010
Oh god.

3622
02:40:44,010 --> 02:40:44,290
Oh god.

3623
02:40:44,330 --> 02:40:44,530
Oh god.

3624
02:40:49,470 --> 02:40:49,950
Okay.

3625
02:40:50,570 --> 02:40:51,450
Maybe it's okay.

3626
02:40:57,570 --> 02:40:59,050
You still have the screwdriver.

3627
02:41:01,050 --> 02:41:02,750
My inventory is all messed up.

3628
02:41:02,770 --> 02:41:05,190
My inventory is glitched so I can't see what I have.

3629
02:41:06,790 --> 02:41:07,670
Yes, I do!

3630
02:41:08,730 --> 02:41:10,770
Oh, I can use it in my room, can't I?

3631
02:41:10,930 --> 02:41:12,930
But the...

3632
02:41:17,010 --> 02:41:18,830
I don't have the rope anymore.

3633
02:41:18,930 --> 02:41:19,950
Unless I can just drop.

3634
02:41:23,030 --> 02:41:23,670
Oh, wait.

3635
02:41:23,830 --> 02:41:24,210
Oh.

3636
02:41:25,210 --> 02:41:26,710
Looks like dad... I just realized.

3637
02:41:26,870 --> 02:41:30,910
Looks like dad gave me his last buck from the opossum, but...

3638
02:41:31,950 --> 02:41:32,930
There's no money left.

3639
02:41:33,210 --> 02:41:34,450
How does he buy his lunch?

3640
02:41:34,690 --> 02:41:36,870
Object 1 out of 5.

3641
02:41:40,090 --> 02:41:47,030
When our town's retro shop got the new Mecha Zendrillix robot, dad promised he'd take me to go see it.

3642
02:41:47,250 --> 02:41:50,450
I wanted one so badly, but dad didn't have any money.

3643
02:41:51,450 --> 02:41:54,390
I bought it a few weeks later and I thought I'd never see it again.

3644
02:41:56,390 --> 02:41:58,550
Turns out dad was the one who bought it.

3645
02:41:58,650 --> 02:42:02,630
He worked overtime every day for weeks just so he could surprise me.

3646
02:42:02,890 --> 02:42:04,410
I was so happy.

3647
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:10,500
This kid...

3648
02:42:11,440 --> 02:42:12,400
This kid...

3649
02:42:12,400 --> 02:42:14,460
needs to be more grateful.

3650
02:42:14,840 --> 02:42:15,260
Okay.

3651
02:42:17,320 --> 02:42:18,660
Maybe I can...

3652
02:42:22,570 --> 02:42:24,070
do the one in my room then.

3653
02:42:24,090 --> 02:42:24,670
Let's try it.

3654
02:42:25,930 --> 02:42:26,470
Oh, gosh.

3655
02:42:26,630 --> 02:42:27,550
Please don't be down here.

3656
02:42:39,160 --> 02:42:39,520
Okay.

3657
02:42:39,560 --> 02:42:39,720
Okay.

3658
02:42:39,780 --> 02:42:39,960
Okay.

3659
02:42:40,260 --> 02:42:40,620
Okay.

3660
02:42:40,620 --> 02:42:40,940
Okay.

3661
02:42:41,060 --> 02:42:41,060
Okay.

3662
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:42,780
Um...

3663
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:45,660
Screwdriver.

3664
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:49,320
Eek!

3665
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:50,880
Oh, yo!

3666
02:42:51,080 --> 02:42:51,840
That way it works!

3667
02:42:59,360 --> 02:43:01,260
I mean, he's trying to save his dad from a possession.

3668
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:02,260
Yeah, I know.

3669
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:04,580
But before that...

3670
02:43:05,880 --> 02:43:08,760
He was like, dad, I don't want to go to this pizza place every day.

3671
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:10,340
I'm so sick of the pizza place.

3672
02:43:13,140 --> 02:43:14,720
Be grateful you have somewhere to go.

3673
02:43:14,840 --> 02:43:16,380
And your dad buys you toys and stuff.

3674
02:43:19,340 --> 02:43:20,040
Hey, Jeff.

3675
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:21,380
Don't cause me trouble.

3676
02:43:22,460 --> 02:43:23,020
Thank you!

3677
02:43:25,480 --> 02:43:27,120
Oh, there's people here actually.

3678
02:43:30,700 --> 02:43:31,360
Enraged customer.

3679
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:33,120
It's taking forever to get my pizza.

3680
02:43:33,240 --> 02:43:36,480
I swear the longer I wait, the more I can hear the rats in the walls.

3681
02:43:37,220 --> 02:43:39,300
Like, what if the kitchen has rats?

3682
02:43:39,300 --> 02:43:43,040
Even worse, what if the cooks are rats?

3683
02:43:44,240 --> 02:43:45,760
Don't tell me to calm down.

3684
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:46,940
You know I have...

3685
02:43:47,940 --> 02:43:48,540
Moosophobia?

3686
02:43:49,500 --> 02:43:50,560
What's a Moosophobia?

3687
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:52,320
Seems distracted.

3688
02:43:52,680 --> 02:43:53,340
And paranoid.

3689
02:43:53,640 --> 02:43:56,420
Um... I don't think she's that paranoid.

3690
02:43:56,520 --> 02:43:58,040
I think she's actually quite valid.

3691
02:43:58,140 --> 02:43:59,640
This place is really gross.

3692
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:05,320
Is there anything else in here that I can grab?

3693
02:44:08,300 --> 02:44:08,860
Ratatouille.

3694
02:44:11,400 --> 02:44:11,960
Ratatouille.

3695
02:44:12,980 --> 02:44:14,380
We got some more things.

3696
02:44:14,680 --> 02:44:15,260
So let's...

3697
02:44:15,260 --> 02:44:16,600
Maybe the vouch?

3698
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:16,880
No.

3699
02:44:18,700 --> 02:44:19,260
Oh!

3700
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:20,000
Puzzle matrix.

3701
02:44:24,130 --> 02:44:25,150
Oh, it's this one!

3702
02:44:27,830 --> 02:44:29,030
Solve the puzzle.

3703
02:44:31,010 --> 02:44:31,570
Oh...

3704
02:44:46,930 --> 02:44:48,250
Do I have to?

3705
02:44:55,040 --> 02:44:56,540
Do I have to solve it?

3706
02:45:00,680 --> 02:45:01,400
Oh, gosh.

3707
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:02,980
Guys, we're gonna be here for a while.

3708
02:45:03,160 --> 02:45:04,200
What is... What is this?

3709
02:45:05,300 --> 02:45:07,320
What even part of his body is that?

3710
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:09,120
Oh, gosh.

3711
02:45:15,860 --> 02:45:16,260
Oh!

3712
02:45:24,370 --> 02:45:26,130
The rest of the stream is here.

3713
02:45:29,710 --> 02:45:30,410
Aw, man.

3714
02:45:31,610 --> 02:45:33,030
Maybe another time, Oz.

3715
02:45:33,050 --> 02:45:33,690
Well, you know...

3716
02:45:34,350 --> 02:45:35,150
Ozzy, we're busy.

3717
02:45:35,210 --> 02:45:36,570
We don't have time for this, you know?

3718
02:45:37,710 --> 02:45:39,190
We're busy, Oswald.

3719
02:45:39,450 --> 02:45:40,110
We're busy.

3720
02:45:49,380 --> 02:45:51,880
If I had a voucher, I could redeem it here for a prize.

3721
02:45:52,120 --> 02:45:53,520
That rocket ship looks so cool.

3722
02:45:54,100 --> 02:45:55,760
Why am I fixing these anyway?

3723
02:45:56,200 --> 02:45:58,400
Actually, don't... Not quite sure why.

3724
02:46:00,600 --> 02:46:02,660
I didn't even eat my lunch!

3725
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:06,060
Oh!

3726
02:46:06,060 --> 02:46:07,360
That was binary!

3727
02:46:08,060 --> 02:46:09,340
What did that say?

3728
02:46:11,040 --> 02:46:11,580
Hmm...

3729
02:46:13,180 --> 02:46:15,080
Interesting... Interesting... Interesting...

3730
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:19,140
Shoot the space balloons!

3731
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:22,280
Oh!

3732
02:46:22,280 --> 02:46:22,800
Oh!

3733
02:46:22,860 --> 02:46:23,120
Oh!

3734
02:46:23,220 --> 02:46:23,440
Oh!

3735
02:46:23,440 --> 02:46:23,700
Oh!

3736
02:46:24,900 --> 02:46:26,200
Oh my goodness!

3737
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:27,540
Oh my god!

3738
02:46:27,940 --> 02:46:30,520
Oh, I can move!

3739
02:46:30,780 --> 02:46:31,300
Wait...

3740
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:33,160
Oh, this is really weird.

3741
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:35,160
Wait... Oh, this is weird.

3742
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:36,140
Okay, hold on.

3743
02:46:39,220 --> 02:46:40,480
I don't like this one.

3744
02:46:41,820 --> 02:46:43,820
It's like you move like this...

3745
02:46:45,080 --> 02:46:45,840
Oh my god.

3746
02:46:46,060 --> 02:46:47,900
And you shoot like this...

3747
02:46:47,900 --> 02:46:48,880
Oh my god.

3748
02:46:49,180 --> 02:46:50,040
And you...

3749
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:51,480
Oh, I don't like this one.

3750
02:46:57,380 --> 02:46:58,520
It's so hard to move!

3751
02:47:06,100 --> 02:47:07,620
It's so hard to move!

3752
02:47:11,630 --> 02:47:12,250
Good game.

3753
02:47:12,690 --> 02:47:14,330
Don't have the right stuff for this one.

3754
02:47:15,310 --> 02:47:16,870
Don't have the right stuff for this one.

3755
02:47:17,530 --> 02:47:18,890
Don't have the right stuff for this one.

3756
02:47:18,970 --> 02:47:20,250
I think we're out of stuff actually.

3757
02:47:21,310 --> 02:47:22,810
I would be able to tell...

3758
02:47:23,810 --> 02:47:24,170
If...

3759
02:47:26,810 --> 02:47:28,450
If I could see my inventory.

3760
02:47:29,130 --> 02:47:30,730
Why is my game bugged?

3761
02:47:35,110 --> 02:47:35,830
Big kid?

3762
02:47:37,050 --> 02:47:37,410
What?

3763
02:47:38,030 --> 02:47:38,830
What does that mean?

3764
02:47:40,710 --> 02:47:41,990
What about my tickets though?

3765
02:47:42,050 --> 02:47:42,490
I have tickets.

3766
02:47:44,710 --> 02:47:45,150
Somewhere.

3767
02:47:48,290 --> 02:47:49,470
What about my tickets?

3768
02:47:52,370 --> 02:47:54,250
Trade the tickets in the pass for a voucher.

3769
02:47:54,370 --> 02:47:54,570
Oh!

3770
02:47:55,150 --> 02:47:56,210
That one makes sense.

3771
02:47:56,410 --> 02:47:56,710
Well...

3772
02:47:57,190 --> 02:47:58,690
Who am I trading them to?

3773
02:48:02,930 --> 02:48:03,670
Everybody's gone.

3774
02:48:03,850 --> 02:48:04,810
The place is possessed.

3775
02:48:10,380 --> 02:48:10,820
OK.

3776
02:48:10,900 --> 02:48:11,620
Go to the ball pit.

3777
02:48:23,670 --> 02:48:26,210
Posse will get a job repairing and restoring arcade machines.

3778
02:48:26,370 --> 02:48:27,230
If he makes it out alive...

3779
02:48:27,230 --> 02:48:27,310
Oh!

3780
02:48:27,330 --> 02:48:28,510
Trip over five times!

3781
02:48:28,650 --> 02:48:28,790
Oh!

3782
02:48:28,830 --> 02:48:29,690
I finally got it.

3783
02:48:30,590 --> 02:48:32,070
The voice that I heard before.

3784
02:48:32,750 --> 02:48:34,070
Wonder where it came from.

3785
02:48:34,230 --> 02:48:34,750
What voice?

3786
02:48:36,130 --> 02:48:36,570
Wait.

3787
02:48:36,610 --> 02:48:37,210
What are you talking about?

3788
02:48:42,150 --> 02:48:43,510
The lights are out!

3789
02:48:44,570 --> 02:48:46,670
Gotta figure out how to get them back on!

3790
02:48:49,410 --> 02:48:50,290
No, no, no.

3791
02:48:58,680 --> 02:48:59,120
Oh!

3792
02:49:02,920 --> 02:49:05,700
That is a good question, isn't it?

3793
02:49:06,440 --> 02:49:06,900
Oswald.

3794
02:49:07,160 --> 02:49:08,160
How do we...

3795
02:49:10,720 --> 02:49:12,980
How do we turn the lights on?

3796
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:19,960
Wasn't there a fuse box?

3797
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:23,000
Yes, there was a fuse box in the backstage.

3798
02:49:25,400 --> 02:49:27,100
I used to hate slide puzzles too.

3799
02:49:27,160 --> 02:49:30,800
The trick is to concentrate on just the top row and left side.

3800
02:49:30,800 --> 02:49:32,060
Works every time.

3801
02:49:32,720 --> 02:49:33,120
Really?

3802
02:49:33,760 --> 02:49:35,080
Should we try it out?

3803
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:39,060
I'm avoiding my problems!

3804
02:49:40,480 --> 02:49:41,080
Yeah!

3805
02:49:42,940 --> 02:49:44,980
I'm avoiding my problems!

3806
02:49:46,120 --> 02:49:46,960
Let's go!

3807
02:49:49,280 --> 02:49:50,240
This way.

3808
02:49:53,400 --> 02:49:54,200
Woo!

3809
02:49:54,520 --> 02:49:55,100
Okay.

3810
02:49:55,180 --> 02:49:55,940
Let's try it.

3811
02:49:56,140 --> 02:49:57,500
So solve...

3812
02:49:57,500 --> 02:49:58,440
Sorry.

3813
02:49:59,080 --> 02:50:00,900
The top is nearly solved.

3814
02:50:01,540 --> 02:50:02,340
Oh!

3815
02:50:20,380 --> 02:50:21,840
Oh, I think I went the wrong way.

3816
02:50:25,770 --> 02:50:27,170
I think I went the wrong way.

3817
02:50:42,580 --> 02:50:43,880
You guys can't say...

3818
02:50:43,880 --> 02:50:44,620
Mint...

3819
02:50:45,060 --> 02:50:47,320
When you know that I'm bad at the slide puzzles.

3820
02:50:49,440 --> 02:50:53,140
You guys can't say that when you guys know that I'm bad at the slide puzzles.

3821
02:50:55,820 --> 02:50:57,160
This is how we started, right?

3822
02:50:57,380 --> 02:50:57,960
Like this?

3823
02:50:58,200 --> 02:50:58,600
Wait.

3824
02:50:58,680 --> 02:50:59,500
Actually, I can't tell.

3825
02:51:00,360 --> 02:51:00,760
Maybe...

3826
02:51:01,540 --> 02:51:01,940
Maybe...

3827
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:10,920
I remember the time I learned how to do sliding puzzles just to 100% go strict and probably forgot how to do sliding puzzles.

3828
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:22,560
Wait.

3829
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:25,920
Do I have to do a...

3830
02:51:35,310 --> 02:51:35,790
Yeah!

3831
02:51:35,890 --> 02:51:36,090
See?

3832
02:51:36,270 --> 02:51:36,850
Oh, gosh.

3833
02:51:36,990 --> 02:51:37,290
Okay.

3834
02:51:37,350 --> 02:51:37,630
Hold on.

3835
02:51:40,570 --> 02:51:41,050
Oh.

3836
02:51:44,010 --> 02:51:44,490
Oh.

3837
02:51:44,750 --> 02:51:45,130
Oh.

3838
02:51:45,130 --> 02:51:45,230
Oh.

3839
02:51:45,230 --> 02:51:45,370
Oh.

3840
02:51:45,430 --> 02:51:45,630
Hold on.

3841
02:51:45,710 --> 02:51:46,270
Hold on.

3842
02:51:46,330 --> 02:51:46,690
Hold on.

3843
02:51:47,130 --> 02:51:47,530
Wait.

3844
02:51:49,970 --> 02:51:50,710
If I...

3845
02:51:50,710 --> 02:51:51,610
Hold on.

3846
02:51:52,450 --> 02:51:52,850
Wait.

3847
02:51:52,890 --> 02:51:53,350
Hold on.

3848
02:51:54,890 --> 02:51:55,690
If I...

3849
02:51:59,220 --> 02:51:59,620
Wait.

3850
02:51:59,740 --> 02:52:00,780
I think we're back where we started.

3851
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:02,500
Wait.

3852
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:03,140
Hold on.

3853
02:52:04,260 --> 02:52:04,660
Oh.

3854
02:52:04,680 --> 02:52:05,000
Hold on.

3855
02:52:08,020 --> 02:52:09,920
I wish I could use my mouse.

3856
02:52:09,960 --> 02:52:11,620
I hate using the watch to...

3857
02:52:12,280 --> 02:52:12,840
Hold on.

3858
02:52:17,650 --> 02:52:18,050
Holding.

3859
02:52:18,570 --> 02:52:18,970
Hold.

3860
02:52:20,050 --> 02:52:20,450
Hold.

3861
02:52:21,390 --> 02:52:21,790
Hold.

3862
02:52:22,190 --> 02:52:22,310
Hold.

3863
02:52:22,310 --> 02:52:22,410
Hold.

3864
02:52:22,570 --> 02:52:22,970
Hold.

3865
02:52:22,970 --> 02:52:22,990
Hold.

3866
02:52:33,430 --> 02:52:33,830
Hold.

3867
02:52:33,890 --> 02:52:34,030
Not...

3868
02:52:34,030 --> 02:52:35,170
How do we get it out of the corner?

3869
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:41,500
How do we get it out of the corner?

3870
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:46,780
It looks like his teeth are really close to his eyes.

3871
02:52:51,540 --> 02:52:52,000
Easy...

3872
02:52:52,620 --> 02:52:54,040
It's so easy about it.

3873
02:52:56,560 --> 02:52:57,020
Wait.

3874
02:52:57,140 --> 02:52:58,900
This is the left bottom left.

3875
02:53:00,180 --> 02:53:00,640
Let's

3876
02:53:11,230 --> 02:53:12,330
go kids over first...

3877
02:53:13,290 --> 02:53:13,750
And...

3878
02:53:14,510 --> 02:53:15,990
Am I sitting?

3879
02:53:16,350 --> 02:53:17,070
Is the thing in context?

3880
02:53:22,830 --> 02:53:27,150
She wasn't kidding about the puzzles.

3881
02:53:27,310 --> 02:53:31,490
I'm never ever in my afterlife been good with the sliding puzzles.

3882
02:53:32,230 --> 02:53:33,330
Please understand.

3883
02:53:33,950 --> 02:53:35,530
It looks so close.

3884
02:53:57,840 --> 02:54:01,420
I'm just rotating them around in circles at this point.

3885
02:54:04,830 --> 02:54:06,690
How do I get it out of the corner?

3886
02:54:07,330 --> 02:54:10,990
Rotate each corner to move the pieces you want closer.

3887
02:54:16,780 --> 02:54:18,260
Top, middle, to top.

3888
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:25,940
Two hours.

3889
02:54:26,040 --> 02:54:28,660
Sometimes I

3890
02:54:40,110 --> 02:54:40,550
just...

3891
02:54:40,550 --> 02:54:47,250
Gosh, you say all you have to do is figure out the top and the left side.

3892
02:54:47,610 --> 02:54:49,690
That's like figuring out part of the puzzle.

3893
02:54:49,950 --> 02:54:50,850
That's the issue.

3894
02:54:51,090 --> 02:54:52,730
I don't know how to figure it out!

3895
02:55:00,240 --> 02:55:01,900
Just figure it out!

3896
02:55:24,440 --> 02:55:26,140
Why can't I use a number pad?

3897
02:55:26,360 --> 02:55:26,840
Okay, awesome.

3898
02:55:27,240 --> 02:55:28,880
My left hand was getting tired.

3899
02:55:32,100 --> 02:55:33,620
I'm just gonna brute force it.

3900
02:55:52,330 --> 02:55:53,690
Oh no, I think I ruined it.

3901
02:56:04,400 --> 02:56:06,700
All you have to do is draw the rest of the outline.

3902
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:09,740
So

3903
02:56:38,660 --> 02:56:39,100
close!

3904
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:45,700
We're so close!

3905
02:57:01,280 --> 02:57:02,660
I didn't listen to you.

3906
02:57:02,680 --> 02:57:03,980
You said solve the top right.

3907
02:57:04,460 --> 02:57:05,600
I'm doing the bottom.

3908
02:57:05,800 --> 02:57:08,020
Or you were like, the top left, I'm doing the bottom right.

3909
02:57:30,040 --> 02:57:30,780
Order though!

3910
02:57:36,940 --> 02:57:38,080
Okay, done.

3911
02:57:40,560 --> 02:57:41,240
What's the...

3912
02:57:41,240 --> 02:57:42,140
Oh, this side.

3913
02:57:51,830 --> 02:57:53,250
How do I get it up there?

3914
02:57:56,410 --> 02:57:59,010
I don't understand how these puzzles work at all!

3915
02:57:59,010 --> 02:57:59,510
Oh no!

3916
02:58:02,330 --> 02:58:03,810
I'll never understand!

3917
02:58:05,070 --> 02:58:07,390
My brain doesn't comprehend!

3918
02:58:16,790 --> 02:58:18,990
Gotta be honest, Mint, I can't solve this either.

3919
02:58:23,410 --> 02:58:24,550
Nah, I'd puzzle.

3920
02:58:26,350 --> 02:58:27,610
I almost have it.

3921
02:58:27,690 --> 02:58:28,310
Do I actually?

3922
02:58:29,010 --> 02:58:29,710
I'm close?

3923
02:58:30,690 --> 02:58:31,670
You're really close.

3924
02:58:31,790 --> 02:58:32,310
Wait, I am?

3925
02:58:35,910 --> 02:58:38,650
Counterclockwise on the bottom right four tiles.

3926
02:58:51,940 --> 02:58:53,600
Bottom left are good too?

3927
02:58:58,090 --> 02:59:00,990
Oh wait, this one is in the correct spot, isn't it?

3928
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:09,520
You know one thing that was funny?

3929
02:59:09,700 --> 02:59:11,060
I was thinking of...

3930
02:59:11,940 --> 02:59:13,300
Oh, what's that game called?

3931
02:59:13,600 --> 02:59:15,860
There was a game that I was like, oh, maybe I'll try this.

3932
02:59:16,140 --> 02:59:17,440
I'll stream this one.

3933
02:59:17,440 --> 02:59:18,820
It's called...

3934
02:59:20,220 --> 02:59:21,220
The Observer?

3935
02:59:21,480 --> 02:59:22,460
The Watcher?

3936
02:59:23,360 --> 02:59:25,780
It's only puzzle games.

3937
02:59:27,220 --> 02:59:28,880
It's only puzzles.

3938
02:59:29,320 --> 02:59:30,240
And I was like...

3939
02:59:30,240 --> 02:59:31,040
The Witness!

3940
02:59:37,560 --> 02:59:38,780
The Wit...

3941
02:59:42,520 --> 02:59:44,200
Synonyms are hard, you guys.

3942
02:59:45,360 --> 02:59:48,960
Oh gosh, it's almost been 10 minutes and I've been stupid!

3943
02:59:49,140 --> 02:59:50,800
I can't believe it!

3944
02:59:50,800 --> 02:59:51,500
I can't figure this out!

3945
02:59:55,820 --> 02:59:58,340
My best time will be my only time.

3946
02:59:58,840 --> 03:00:00,140
I'm having a time.

3947
03:00:03,220 --> 03:00:06,220
Pretty funny that they just assume that you're having a best time.

3948
03:00:09,240 --> 03:00:11,100
Want me to give it step-by-step?

3949
03:00:11,340 --> 03:00:11,760
Yeah!

3950
03:00:14,220 --> 03:00:15,540
What's the step-by-step?

3951
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:26,060
What if you did some super exclusive fan service right now to spite the VOD watchers who will skip the entire slide puzzle section?

3952
03:00:27,880 --> 03:00:30,140
But yeah, but you can't put it in the timestamp.

3953
03:00:30,300 --> 03:00:32,240
Or you can't put a timestamp in the comments.

3954
03:00:34,180 --> 03:00:35,500
Do the witness parody.

3955
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:36,420
The Looker.

3956
03:00:39,420 --> 03:00:40,280
What would I...

3957
03:00:40,280 --> 03:00:41,380
What would you want me to do?

3958
03:00:41,780 --> 03:00:44,700
What would you want me to do?

3959
03:00:44,880 --> 03:00:45,520
What would you want me to do?

3960
03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:48,540
This is only for real VOD watchers.

3961
03:00:48,560 --> 03:00:53,100
This is only for real ones who watch me struggle.

3962
03:00:53,500 --> 03:00:54,040
You know?

3963
03:00:54,200 --> 03:00:58,360
This is for all the real ones who are just like, I'll watch Mint do whatever.

3964
03:00:58,820 --> 03:00:59,380
You know?

3965
03:00:59,560 --> 03:01:00,700
I'll watch...

3966
03:01:03,180 --> 03:01:04,760
You can't clip it.

3967
03:01:04,820 --> 03:01:07,060
You can't put a time in the comments.

3968
03:01:07,960 --> 03:01:09,140
What should I do though?

3969
03:01:21,990 --> 03:01:22,550
Counterclockwise.

3970
03:01:22,610 --> 03:01:23,170
Wait, hold on.

3971
03:01:24,830 --> 03:01:25,390
Counterclockwise.

3972
03:01:25,390 --> 03:01:27,670
The bottom for one more time.

3973
03:01:27,770 --> 03:01:28,070
Okay.

3974
03:01:29,390 --> 03:01:29,690
Sorry.

3975
03:01:29,790 --> 03:01:31,110
The music is driving me a little bit crazy.

3976
03:01:31,210 --> 03:01:31,470
Okay.

3977
03:01:31,610 --> 03:01:31,910
Counter.

3978
03:01:32,810 --> 03:01:33,110
Wait.

3979
03:01:33,230 --> 03:01:33,370
Nope.

3980
03:01:33,410 --> 03:01:33,590
Nope.

3981
03:01:33,590 --> 03:01:33,730
Nope.

3982
03:01:33,750 --> 03:01:33,870
Nope.

3983
03:01:33,870 --> 03:01:34,010
Nope.

3984
03:01:34,010 --> 03:01:34,070
Nope.

3985
03:01:34,070 --> 03:01:34,170
Nope.

3986
03:01:34,170 --> 03:01:34,250
Nope.

3987
03:01:34,250 --> 03:01:34,470
Nope.

3988
03:01:34,470 --> 03:01:34,690
Nope.

3989
03:01:36,210 --> 03:01:36,510
Nope.

3990
03:01:39,340 --> 03:01:39,640
Nope.

3991
03:01:39,640 --> 03:01:40,100
Until when?

3992
03:01:41,180 --> 03:01:42,180
When do I stop?

3993
03:01:56,760 --> 03:01:58,690
Now move the eyes to the middle right.

3994
03:02:00,850 --> 03:02:01,910
I can't.

3995
03:02:05,230 --> 03:02:05,810
Wait.

3996
03:02:06,370 --> 03:02:06,950
Oh.

3997
03:02:10,590 --> 03:02:11,110
Wait.

3998
03:02:14,390 --> 03:02:15,850
Rotate the bottom one more time.

3999
03:02:16,370 --> 03:02:16,950
What?

4000
03:02:18,420 --> 03:02:19,210
I'm so confused.

4001
03:02:20,590 --> 03:02:23,290
You say rotate but until here?

4002
03:02:25,430 --> 03:02:26,630
How does that get me...

4003
03:02:26,630 --> 03:02:26,870
What?

4004
03:02:26,990 --> 03:02:27,630
I'm so confused.

4005
03:02:30,010 --> 03:02:32,110
Try to move the left ear to the middle left.

4006
03:02:32,990 --> 03:02:34,750
And the eyes to the top left.

4007
03:02:44,230 --> 03:02:47,430
You need to get the eyes rotating ahead of the right ear.

4008
03:02:54,130 --> 03:02:55,010
Ahead of the...

4009
03:02:55,010 --> 03:02:55,950
Ahead of the ear?

4010
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:01,020
Would this be right?

4011
03:03:01,360 --> 03:03:01,840
Wait.

4012
03:03:01,980 --> 03:03:02,460
No.

4013
03:03:02,760 --> 03:03:03,120
Uh.

4014
03:03:04,500 --> 03:03:06,040
This is so crazy.

4015
03:03:06,760 --> 03:03:07,980
I don't know what to do.

4016
03:03:08,620 --> 03:03:09,280
Why would you...

4017
03:03:09,280 --> 03:03:09,360
Why?

4018
03:03:09,520 --> 03:03:10,300
I don't even know what...

4019
03:03:10,300 --> 03:03:11,700
I don't even know what fanservice is.

4020
03:03:12,200 --> 03:03:12,860
I don't even know.

4021
03:03:16,360 --> 03:03:17,200
I don't even know...

4022
03:03:17,200 --> 03:03:17,680
I don't even know.

4023
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:18,500
I don't even know.

4024
03:03:19,180 --> 03:03:19,840
What do you...

4025
03:03:19,840 --> 03:03:20,500
What do you...

4026
03:03:20,500 --> 03:03:21,340
What do you even want from me?

4027
03:03:22,660 --> 03:03:23,880
I thought we were just hanging out.

4028
03:03:24,120 --> 03:03:25,340
I thought we were just bros, man.

4029
03:03:34,620 --> 03:03:35,320
Don't be weird.

4030
03:03:36,280 --> 03:03:36,900
Don't be weird.

4031
03:03:37,020 --> 03:03:37,700
We're just bros.

4032
03:03:41,280 --> 03:03:41,600
Bros.

4033
03:03:41,600 --> 03:03:41,920
Bros.

4034
03:03:45,880 --> 03:03:47,360
Bros give each other fan service?

4035
03:03:47,600 --> 03:03:48,880
What would your Oshii do?

4036
03:03:53,670 --> 03:03:57,350
My Oshii... oh wait, I just realized I forgot to, um, unpin this comment.

4037
03:03:57,730 --> 03:04:05,150
My Oshii... she would probably... well, my Oshii has already called me gross and disgusting, so...

4038
03:04:08,210 --> 03:04:09,050
Here's my take.

4039
03:04:09,170 --> 03:04:12,330
From the top right, 1, 2, 3 is correct.

4040
03:04:14,190 --> 03:04:15,630
Try to visualize the following.

4041
03:04:17,150 --> 03:04:21,890
Wait, 13... wait, 13x first roll.

4042
03:04:22,970 --> 03:04:28,330
1, 2... wait, x2x second roll.

4043
03:04:32,710 --> 03:04:37,110
You emo, you're really trying to help, I appreciate you so much.

4044
03:04:39,610 --> 03:04:42,590
You do a lot with your bros.

4045
03:04:42,910 --> 03:04:43,970
Like what?

4046
03:04:44,930 --> 03:04:45,890
Big ham!

4047
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,380
Fan service is acapella settling nanya.

4048
03:04:52,060 --> 03:04:53,340
Shut the fuck up.

4049
03:04:53,760 --> 03:04:54,700
Shut the hell up.

4050
03:04:57,640 --> 03:04:59,400
My brain is frying, you guys.

4051
03:05:03,750 --> 03:05:05,790
Put the eyes above the ear.

4052
03:05:06,390 --> 03:05:08,010
And rotate into place.

4053
03:05:21,580 --> 03:05:23,440
And then we just do a big rotate!

4054
03:05:24,420 --> 03:05:26,080
Here it is, the big roll!

4055
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:28,280
It's the big roll!

4056
03:05:29,260 --> 03:05:30,480
It's the big roll!

4057
03:05:30,480 --> 03:05:32,200
We're doing it!

4058
03:05:32,900 --> 03:05:34,640
We're doing the big roll!

4059
03:05:56,290 --> 03:05:57,570
I hate this game.

4060
03:06:01,440 --> 03:06:06,600
I would rather go back into the darkness of a possessed pizzeria.

4061
03:06:11,900 --> 03:06:13,900
I hate this game.

4062
03:06:18,540 --> 03:06:19,980
Next time...

4063
03:06:21,280 --> 03:06:23,880
I'm gonna hire somebody to...

4064
03:06:23,880 --> 03:06:25,320
You know what, I should have...

4065
03:06:25,320 --> 03:06:30,900
I'm gonna hire somebody that will sit under my desk for every stream that I do.

4066
03:06:31,280 --> 03:06:35,140
And if a game happens to have a slide puzzle...

4067
03:06:36,480 --> 03:06:40,200
You know, bro, the best bro service would be winning the slide puzzle, bro.

4068
03:06:45,090 --> 03:06:51,630
They're gonna hide under my desk and anytime that there's a slide puzzle, they're gonna secretly climb out.

4069
03:06:51,630 --> 03:06:55,090
And they're gonna do the puzzle for me.

4070
03:06:55,210 --> 03:06:56,410
And I will...

4071
03:06:56,410 --> 03:06:57,650
I'll just react.

4072
03:06:57,990 --> 03:07:01,430
And then they'll go crawl back under their hole.

4073
03:07:11,830 --> 03:07:14,150
You could send your...

4074
03:07:15,130 --> 03:07:16,370
Send your applications.

4075
03:07:17,650 --> 03:07:19,870
Show me your slide puzzle credentials.

4076
03:07:20,110 --> 03:07:22,090
Show me your best scores, everybody.

4077
03:07:22,250 --> 03:07:22,870
Okay.

4078
03:07:22,890 --> 03:07:24,050
Oh gosh, here we go.

4079
03:07:26,870 --> 03:07:29,290
Why does he jump in so enthusiastically?

4080
03:07:29,410 --> 03:07:30,330
It kind of annoys me.

4081
03:07:43,910 --> 03:07:45,190
So that's the fan service.

4082
03:07:46,670 --> 03:07:48,430
I don't know what to do.

4083
03:07:49,810 --> 03:07:51,130
For fan service.

4084
03:07:58,080 --> 03:08:00,220
I still can't see anything.

4085
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:09,860
I still can't even see anything.

4086
03:08:10,120 --> 03:08:11,820
Actually, I don't remember what it was at before.

4087
03:08:14,300 --> 03:08:15,080
Okay, here we go.

4088
03:08:23,550 --> 03:08:25,010
But for the fuse...

4089
03:08:27,410 --> 03:08:28,430
I think I hear somebody.

4090
03:08:28,950 --> 03:08:29,450
Oh god.

4091
03:08:36,740 --> 03:08:37,480
Just pull it.

4092
03:08:37,620 --> 03:08:38,340
Oh god.

4093
03:08:40,900 --> 03:08:41,240
Okay.

4094
03:08:42,580 --> 03:08:43,440
We did it.

4095
03:08:43,540 --> 03:08:44,700
Oh wait, are they gonna come in here?

4096
03:08:44,820 --> 03:08:45,440
Oh god, wait.

4097
03:08:45,540 --> 03:08:46,480
I think they're gonna come in here.

4098
03:08:53,560 --> 03:08:53,900
Um...

4099
03:08:54,500 --> 03:08:54,840
I think they're gonna come in here.

4100
03:08:54,840 --> 03:08:55,520
Hide!

4101
03:08:59,680 --> 03:09:00,740
Someone coming in here?

4102
03:09:03,440 --> 03:09:04,360
It's, um...

4103
03:09:04,360 --> 03:09:05,160
It's Springtrap!

4104
03:09:08,540 --> 03:09:13,660
IDK how to solve a slide puzzle and I just move the pieces randomly until I chance upon the answer.

4105
03:09:13,840 --> 03:09:15,400
So I feel so validated right now.

4106
03:09:17,760 --> 03:09:18,280
See?

4107
03:09:20,380 --> 03:09:23,420
You can watch Minto stream and feel validated.

4108
03:09:24,240 --> 03:09:25,500
Okay, we gotta find dad.

4109
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,600
But we have to also wait for Springtrap to leave.

4110
03:09:32,740 --> 03:09:34,340
More like SlideTrap.

4111
03:09:38,520 --> 03:09:39,980
Okay, I think maybe I'm okay.

4112
03:09:50,560 --> 03:09:51,340
There is...

4113
03:09:51,340 --> 03:09:51,840
What's this?

4114
03:09:52,640 --> 03:09:53,620
Oh, token slide!

4115
03:09:54,600 --> 03:09:55,080
Nice.

4116
03:09:57,560 --> 03:10:00,440
And we have a screwdriver so we can now start venting, can't we?

4117
03:10:01,800 --> 03:10:02,900
That will give us...

4118
03:10:02,900 --> 03:10:03,120
Okay.

4119
03:10:03,140 --> 03:10:05,020
More hiding spots, I think.

4120
03:10:10,510 --> 03:10:11,110
I'm scared.

4121
03:10:11,370 --> 03:10:11,790
What's that?

4122
03:10:11,970 --> 03:10:13,030
Oh, no no no no!

4123
03:10:14,290 --> 03:10:15,710
Don't try to play his thing.

4124
03:10:16,470 --> 03:10:17,570
There's a battery on the shelf!

4125
03:10:17,690 --> 03:10:17,910
Nice.

4126
03:10:20,630 --> 03:10:23,090
Thank goodness we knew where the fuse box was, why don't we?

4127
03:10:27,900 --> 03:10:28,960
There's another kid!

4128
03:10:29,280 --> 03:10:32,480
Oh my god, it updated our objective from find dad to find a kid!

4129
03:10:39,290 --> 03:10:41,130
Real fan service is your existence.

4130
03:10:41,190 --> 03:10:41,350
I'm a fan of you.

4131
03:10:41,370 --> 03:10:41,670
It's not bad.

4132
03:10:41,970 --> 03:10:42,030
But...

4133
03:10:42,030 --> 03:10:43,070
Stab me!

4134
03:10:43,950 --> 03:10:47,150
Ghost has no reason to run away from robots?

4135
03:10:49,810 --> 03:10:50,970
It's because...

4136
03:10:51,730 --> 03:10:52,870
Oh my god.

4137
03:10:55,310 --> 03:10:56,470
It's because...

4138
03:10:58,830 --> 03:11:01,630
I'm a human child in this game.

4139
03:11:04,450 --> 03:11:06,010
It was so loud.

4140
03:11:06,230 --> 03:11:06,930
Holy cow.

4141
03:11:07,210 --> 03:11:08,210
Where was the kid?

4142
03:11:09,390 --> 03:11:09,970
Oh...

4143
03:11:09,970 --> 03:11:10,530
Hold on.

4144
03:11:10,670 --> 03:11:11,350
I actually...

4145
03:11:11,370 --> 03:11:12,230
I can actually hear someone coming.

4146
03:11:17,280 --> 03:11:20,560
I can't tell how many of them are walking around right now, you know what I mean?

4147
03:11:28,230 --> 03:11:29,170
Maybe we're okay.

4148
03:11:38,230 --> 03:11:40,990
Trying to find a child in this place.

4149
03:11:50,650 --> 03:11:52,090
It should be open now.

4150
03:11:52,290 --> 03:11:53,390
I can vent.

4151
03:12:03,060 --> 03:12:04,340
Fast travel!

4152
03:12:07,460 --> 03:12:08,100
Alright,

4153
03:12:11,220 --> 03:12:11,720
let's go.

4154
03:12:16,700 --> 03:12:17,720
Thank you!

4155
03:12:19,580 --> 03:12:21,240
Do you care how to describe solving side puzzles?

4156
03:12:21,440 --> 03:12:26,080
Just big loop, small loop, big loop, looping direction, doesn't matter what.

4157
03:12:27,260 --> 03:12:28,040
I see.

4158
03:12:28,460 --> 03:12:29,420
Alright, so...

4159
03:12:29,420 --> 03:12:30,640
We're in the storage.

4160
03:12:30,960 --> 03:12:31,720
Oh, and it shows!

4161
03:12:32,880 --> 03:12:33,360
Wow!

4162
03:12:33,360 --> 03:12:33,840
Nice.

4163
03:12:34,620 --> 03:12:35,100
Okay.

4164
03:12:38,560 --> 03:12:41,960
Oh my gosh, sorry.

4165
03:12:42,120 --> 03:12:42,960
You can see the...

4166
03:12:43,900 --> 03:12:45,140
My... what's it called?

4167
03:12:46,140 --> 03:12:46,620
Stem...

4168
03:12:46,620 --> 03:12:47,820
How do I leave?

4169
03:12:49,580 --> 03:12:50,540
There we go, let's try this way.

4170
03:12:53,120 --> 03:12:53,780
Door's locked.

4171
03:12:55,220 --> 03:12:55,580
Okay.

4172
03:13:02,360 --> 03:13:02,980
Door's locked.

4173
03:13:03,940 --> 03:13:05,280
All these doors are still locked.

4174
03:13:05,380 --> 03:13:06,240
What about the party hallway?

4175
03:13:12,160 --> 03:13:13,800
Where's that crying coming from?

4176
03:13:16,700 --> 03:13:17,320
Not again!

4177
03:13:17,480 --> 03:13:18,100
Are you kidding me?

4178
03:13:18,240 --> 03:13:19,100
Are you kidding me?

4179
03:13:19,620 --> 03:13:20,200
No way.

4180
03:13:20,440 --> 03:13:21,140
No, no, no, no!

4181
03:13:21,180 --> 03:13:22,160
Hide, hide, hide, hide!

4182
03:13:24,380 --> 03:13:25,600
No, no, hide, hide!

4183
03:13:32,020 --> 03:13:34,060
I can't tell if something's coming or not.

4184
03:13:39,300 --> 03:13:42,600
So the lights just turn off periodically, this is so evil!

4185
03:13:43,980 --> 03:13:46,320
Wait, the music is not helping, I can't hear anything.

4186
03:13:48,780 --> 03:13:50,020
Okay, I'm just gonna leave.

4187
03:13:51,880 --> 03:13:52,680
Here we go.

4188
03:13:56,850 --> 03:13:57,650
Who's crying?

4189
03:13:58,070 --> 03:13:58,810
From the kitchen?

4190
03:13:59,090 --> 03:13:59,590
Where?

4191
03:13:59,890 --> 03:14:00,390
Where?

4192
03:14:12,240 --> 03:14:13,060
My lunch!

4193
03:14:14,440 --> 03:14:15,660
Oh my god.

4194
03:14:15,800 --> 03:14:17,360
Oh, she's gonna eat my lunch.

4195
03:14:17,480 --> 03:14:19,160
She's gonna eat it in her trash pile.

4196
03:14:19,400 --> 03:14:20,020
That's right.

4197
03:14:20,700 --> 03:14:22,140
She loves to eat the lunch.

4198
03:14:22,320 --> 03:14:23,440
Oh, she left.

4199
03:14:26,360 --> 03:14:28,100
Does that thing even have a stomach?

4200
03:14:28,360 --> 03:14:30,520
How did it smell my lunch from that far away?

4201
03:14:32,320 --> 03:14:33,320
Oh my god, the rat.

4202
03:14:33,480 --> 03:14:34,420
Shut the hell up, rat.

4203
03:14:36,040 --> 03:14:37,560
There's definitely a kid in the kitchen.

4204
03:14:37,740 --> 03:14:40,480
But I can't get to them until I lure that thing back to its weird nest.

4205
03:14:41,420 --> 03:14:44,200
If it wants food, maybe I can get a slice of pizza from Jeff.

4206
03:14:46,160 --> 03:14:47,240
Talk to Jeff.

4207
03:14:48,280 --> 03:14:49,200
Let's get out of here.

4208
03:14:55,640 --> 03:14:56,440
No way!

4209
03:14:57,600 --> 03:14:59,220
That scared me so bad!

4210
03:15:01,300 --> 03:15:02,040
Ghost children!

4211
03:15:03,300 --> 03:15:04,820
Why were there ghost children there?

4212
03:15:06,760 --> 03:15:07,840
What is going on?

4213
03:15:08,360 --> 03:15:09,140
What is happening?

4214
03:15:11,320 --> 03:15:11,760
Pizza!

4215
03:15:11,760 --> 03:15:12,680
Jeff, pizza!

4216
03:15:17,470 --> 03:15:18,350
Holy moly.

4217
03:15:18,450 --> 03:15:18,550
Oh.

4218
03:15:18,710 --> 03:15:19,390
Hey, Jeff.

4219
03:15:20,310 --> 03:15:21,050
Hey, Jeff.

4220
03:15:21,390 --> 03:15:23,990
Do you have any extra slices of pizza that you could get me?

4221
03:15:24,550 --> 03:15:25,250
Sorry, kid.

4222
03:15:25,410 --> 03:15:26,830
You know things have been tough lately.

4223
03:15:27,030 --> 03:15:27,790
You want something?

4224
03:15:27,890 --> 03:15:28,730
You gotta buy it.

4225
03:15:29,950 --> 03:15:30,390
Oh.

4226
03:15:30,390 --> 03:15:30,830
Okay.

4227
03:15:33,190 --> 03:15:35,170
Find a way to cause a distraction.

4228
03:15:36,310 --> 03:15:36,910
I'm a...

4229
03:15:37,510 --> 03:15:39,010
Oswald's turning to a life of crime!

4230
03:15:39,710 --> 03:15:40,850
What do I do now?

4231
03:15:40,990 --> 03:15:42,370
I can't afford to buy anything.

4232
03:15:43,210 --> 03:15:47,210
If I could just borrow... You can't just borrow a slice of pizza from the kitchen!

4233
03:15:47,730 --> 03:15:49,270
Why don't you trap a rat?

4234
03:15:49,370 --> 03:15:50,370
I'm sure it'll eat it.

4235
03:15:52,710 --> 03:15:54,270
Five-finger discount time?

4236
03:15:54,690 --> 03:15:55,130
No!

4237
03:15:57,330 --> 03:15:59,290
If I could just borrow a slice from the kitchen...

4238
03:15:59,850 --> 03:16:02,050
I have this random rat trap I found.

4239
03:16:02,050 --> 03:16:05,730
I bet a rat chase will get Jeff away from the door for sure.

4240
03:16:08,350 --> 03:16:08,870
Um...

4241
03:16:14,430 --> 03:16:17,870
This guy, like, borrows... Quote-unquote borrows everything.

4242
03:16:19,090 --> 03:16:23,330
He's like... He wanted to borrow the firecracker.

4243
03:16:23,790 --> 03:16:24,470
Oh, wait.

4244
03:16:24,830 --> 03:16:26,610
Let's go fix that other machine.

4245
03:16:27,930 --> 03:16:28,990
Which one was it?

4246
03:16:29,490 --> 03:16:30,410
Not this one.

4247
03:16:31,330 --> 03:16:32,190
Oh, nice.

4248
03:16:33,910 --> 03:16:34,430
Uh...

4249
03:16:35,330 --> 03:16:36,230
Oh, my bad.

4250
03:16:36,470 --> 03:16:36,870
Um...

4251
03:16:39,660 --> 03:16:40,360
Where did it go?

4252
03:16:41,040 --> 03:16:41,600
Token slot?

4253
03:16:45,220 --> 03:16:45,620
Huh?

4254
03:16:46,080 --> 03:16:46,660
Wait, huh?

4255
03:16:47,460 --> 03:16:48,840
Didn't I play this one already?

4256
03:16:49,280 --> 03:16:49,840
Wait, huh?

4257
03:16:50,680 --> 03:16:51,560
Wait, what just happened?

4258
03:16:51,780 --> 03:16:52,020
Huh?

4259
03:16:53,160 --> 03:16:53,660
Wait, what?

4260
03:16:55,060 --> 03:16:56,400
But that was fixing the game!

4261
03:16:57,760 --> 03:16:58,360
Wait, what what?

4262
03:17:01,160 --> 03:17:03,180
Oh, I think it... I accidentally...

4263
03:17:05,800 --> 03:17:06,380
There we go.

4264
03:17:06,860 --> 03:17:07,760
That was weird.

4265
03:17:12,060 --> 03:17:13,240
There's a secret in this?

4266
03:17:13,380 --> 03:17:13,660
Oh, yeah.

4267
03:17:13,700 --> 03:17:15,180
Some people did say there was an extra hat.

4268
03:17:15,440 --> 03:17:16,040
What was it?

4269
03:17:16,060 --> 03:17:16,580
Let's try it.

4270
03:17:19,680 --> 03:17:20,740
I'm not stalling.

4271
03:17:20,740 --> 03:17:22,300
I'm just playing a different game.

4272
03:17:22,880 --> 03:17:24,500
This is technically part of the game.

4273
03:17:24,640 --> 03:17:26,870
You know, I'm not stalling to do other things in the game because...

4274
03:17:30,500 --> 03:17:31,060
Oh, shoot.

4275
03:17:31,260 --> 03:17:31,540
Uh...

4276
03:17:31,960 --> 03:17:32,600
There we go.

4277
03:17:33,520 --> 03:17:33,920
Wait...

4278
03:17:42,650 --> 03:17:44,590
You guys might have to... Oh, dang it!

4279
03:17:44,850 --> 03:17:46,230
Why did I... Why did I...

4280
03:17:48,330 --> 03:17:50,450
I knew I wouldn't have been able to make that.

4281
03:17:50,530 --> 03:17:51,930
I don't know why I thought...

4282
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:03,920
Where's the extra hat?

4283
03:18:09,150 --> 03:18:09,550
Um...

4284
03:18:13,470 --> 03:18:15,130
Do I, like, knock it off my head?

4285
03:18:16,710 --> 03:18:18,070
Is it the hat that I'm wearing?

4286
03:18:23,500 --> 03:18:23,900
Um...

4287
03:18:24,860 --> 03:18:25,720
Or is it, like...

4288
03:18:26,700 --> 03:18:27,680
Oh, my bad.

4289
03:18:28,840 --> 03:18:30,560
Or is it, like, hidden?

4290
03:18:39,950 --> 03:18:41,750
Why are the platforms...

4291
03:18:42,270 --> 03:18:43,770
so hard to...

4292
03:18:57,880 --> 03:18:58,240
Okay.

4293
03:19:12,030 --> 03:19:13,470
No way.

4294
03:19:15,330 --> 03:19:17,650
Did I miss my opportunity to get the hat?

4295
03:19:18,050 --> 03:19:20,090
It's... It's... It's purple guy!

4296
03:19:31,620 --> 03:19:32,520
How would I...

4297
03:19:32,520 --> 03:19:32,900
Okay.

4298
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:33,620
Let's try it again.

4299
03:19:36,760 --> 03:19:37,200
Aw, man.

4300
03:19:39,140 --> 03:19:39,620
Hold on.

4301
03:19:39,680 --> 03:19:40,380
We can get it this time.

4302
03:19:43,180 --> 03:19:43,820
William Afton.

4303
03:19:47,800 --> 03:19:48,380
Oh, shoot.

4304
03:19:48,900 --> 03:19:51,580
I thought the hat was going to be invisible on the platform.

4305
03:19:51,760 --> 03:19:53,840
I didn't think it was going to be actually...

4306
03:19:53,840 --> 03:19:54,380
Oh, my God.

4307
03:19:54,440 --> 03:19:54,760
Please.

4308
03:19:56,540 --> 03:19:58,440
I didn't think it was going to be actually...

4309
03:20:00,200 --> 03:20:01,620
Like, it's a separate room.

4310
03:20:06,660 --> 03:20:08,260
Is this the only game with a secret?

4311
03:20:13,840 --> 03:20:14,240
Um...

4312
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:15,800
Purple man.

4313
03:20:20,850 --> 03:20:21,610
I tried.

4314
03:20:22,350 --> 03:20:23,610
You guys, I tried!

4315
03:20:29,270 --> 03:20:29,810
Oh, yeah.

4316
03:20:29,930 --> 03:20:30,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4317
03:20:30,550 --> 03:20:31,430
Ba-da-da-da-doo.

4318
03:20:32,690 --> 03:20:33,850
Ba-da-da-da-da-doo.

4319
03:20:35,430 --> 03:20:37,690
At least I don't mind the song so much in this one.

4320
03:20:37,690 --> 03:20:38,370
Ha-ha-ha.

4321
03:20:40,510 --> 03:20:41,290
Oh, wow.

4322
03:20:41,670 --> 03:20:42,750
How did I get that?

4323
03:20:43,410 --> 03:20:44,190
I'm gaming?

4324
03:20:46,590 --> 03:20:47,670
I think I'm gaming?

4325
03:20:48,730 --> 03:20:50,250
I think I'm so good at this now?

4326
03:20:55,270 --> 03:20:55,750
Oh.

4327
03:20:58,830 --> 03:21:00,250
Brr-brr-brr-brr-brr-brr-brr.

4328
03:21:02,350 --> 03:21:02,830
Um...

4329
03:21:02,830 --> 03:21:03,930
Is this... wait.

4330
03:21:05,570 --> 03:21:06,050
Okay.

4331
03:21:06,730 --> 03:21:07,210
What?

4332
03:21:14,610 --> 03:21:15,850
Oh, I'm so stupid.

4333
03:21:22,500 --> 03:21:23,020
Okay.

4334
03:21:23,380 --> 03:21:23,900
Okay.

4335
03:21:25,540 --> 03:21:26,060
Okay.

4336
03:21:26,620 --> 03:21:27,140
Okay.

4337
03:21:28,320 --> 03:21:28,840
Okay.

4338
03:21:28,840 --> 03:21:29,120
There we go.

4339
03:21:29,200 --> 03:21:29,440
Nice!

4340
03:21:32,480 --> 03:21:34,080
I actually don't know...

4341
03:21:34,080 --> 03:21:35,320
This is Balloon Boy, isn't it?

4342
03:21:35,380 --> 03:21:36,440
I actually don't know his lore.

4343
03:21:41,500 --> 03:21:42,780
He's just a little silly.

4344
03:21:43,120 --> 03:21:43,540
Yeah.

4345
03:21:45,260 --> 03:21:45,780
Okay.

4346
03:21:50,700 --> 03:21:51,880
Let's go get this balloon boy.

4347
03:21:51,880 --> 03:21:52,060
Balloon.

4348
03:21:52,180 --> 03:21:53,060
I mean, this hat.

4349
03:22:28,260 --> 03:22:29,400
What was the return plan?

4350
03:22:32,240 --> 03:22:33,480
I don't really know.

4351
03:22:34,020 --> 03:22:35,020
That's a W for me.

4352
03:22:35,220 --> 03:22:36,180
Rescue the children?

4353
03:22:39,760 --> 03:22:40,160
Okay.

4354
03:22:41,080 --> 03:22:41,820
One child.

4355
03:22:42,280 --> 03:22:42,980
Child ghetto.

4356
03:22:43,460 --> 03:22:44,200
Oh my god!

4357
03:22:44,420 --> 03:22:45,860
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

4358
03:22:46,040 --> 03:22:47,060
No, no, no, I hate this.

4359
03:22:47,240 --> 03:22:48,320
Wait, I hate this so much.

4360
03:22:49,940 --> 03:22:50,340
Leap!

4361
03:22:55,090 --> 03:22:56,110
Oh, sorry children!

4362
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:04,740
Sorry children!

4363
03:23:04,960 --> 03:23:05,480
Okay, okay, okay.

4364
03:23:07,240 --> 03:23:08,020
Rescue the children.

4365
03:23:08,220 --> 03:23:08,380
Okay.

4366
03:23:09,040 --> 03:23:09,440
Okay.

4367
03:23:09,860 --> 03:23:11,880
This one stresses me out already.

4368
03:23:14,380 --> 03:23:16,120
This one already stresses me out.

4369
03:23:16,260 --> 03:23:16,900
I don't like it.

4370
03:23:17,100 --> 03:23:17,900
I don't like it.

4371
03:23:17,940 --> 03:23:18,340
I don't like it!

4372
03:23:20,560 --> 03:23:21,160
Oh my god!

4373
03:23:25,380 --> 03:23:26,120
Oh, shoot.

4374
03:23:27,420 --> 03:23:28,140
We did it!

4375
03:23:28,540 --> 03:23:29,800
Wait, what do you mean I failed the save?

4376
03:23:29,920 --> 03:23:30,200
Hide

4377
03:23:36,460 --> 03:23:36,780
me!

4378
03:23:38,980 --> 03:23:39,960
Oh, we ate one!

4379
03:23:40,680 --> 03:23:41,960
Oh, one got eaten.

4380
03:23:44,360 --> 03:23:45,020
No way!

4381
03:23:45,220 --> 03:23:46,200
How is that even possible?

4382
03:23:46,200 --> 03:23:47,660
How is this even possible then?

4383
03:23:48,060 --> 03:23:48,480
Oh, shoot.

4384
03:23:49,880 --> 03:23:51,380
How is this even possible?

4385
03:23:54,820 --> 03:23:55,480
Oh my god.

4386
03:23:55,600 --> 03:23:56,320
Oh my god.

4387
03:23:56,460 --> 03:23:57,040
Oh my god.

4388
03:24:00,080 --> 03:24:00,700
Oh my god.

4389
03:24:01,400 --> 03:24:02,360
Don't get eaten!

4390
03:24:02,620 --> 03:24:03,100
Don't get eaten!

4391
03:24:04,020 --> 03:24:04,660
Little kid!

4392
03:24:04,880 --> 03:24:05,500
Little kid!

4393
03:24:14,660 --> 03:24:15,580
I found the strat.

4394
03:24:17,100 --> 03:24:17,540
Yippee!

4395
03:24:17,860 --> 03:24:19,260
I saved all the children!

4396
03:24:25,720 --> 03:24:26,580
Save them.

4397
03:24:27,660 --> 03:24:28,180
Creepy.

4398
03:24:30,280 --> 03:24:31,660
I got some tickets more.

4399
03:24:35,380 --> 03:24:37,340
That one, we've beat...

4400
03:24:39,760 --> 03:24:41,260
We've beat all of them.

4401
03:24:42,440 --> 03:24:42,960
Ish.

4402
03:24:43,560 --> 03:24:45,340
We've beat almost all of them.

4403
03:24:45,880 --> 03:24:46,900
I wonder...

4404
03:24:46,900 --> 03:24:48,100
Let's see.

4405
03:24:48,180 --> 03:24:48,540
Hold on.

4406
03:24:49,880 --> 03:24:50,400
I...

4407
03:24:51,560 --> 03:24:52,080
Okay.

4408
03:24:52,660 --> 03:24:53,900
I'm scared to go...

4409
03:24:53,900 --> 03:24:54,040
Wait, what?

4410
03:24:54,040 --> 03:24:54,720
What am I doing now?

4411
03:24:54,840 --> 03:24:56,420
Oh, find a way to cause a distraction.

4412
03:24:56,560 --> 03:24:56,840
That's right.

4413
03:24:58,460 --> 03:24:59,360
Let's get a rat.

4414
03:24:59,900 --> 03:25:01,320
Where can I find a rat at?

4415
03:25:03,680 --> 03:25:04,120
Um...

4416
03:25:05,760 --> 03:25:07,120
There are rats in here?

4417
03:25:08,540 --> 03:25:09,720
Rats down here.

4418
03:25:10,180 --> 03:25:10,720
What's this?

4419
03:25:11,680 --> 03:25:13,700
This puddle looks like it's been here for a while.

4420
03:25:14,080 --> 03:25:15,900
Hope it doesn't seep into my shoes.

4421
03:25:16,320 --> 03:25:16,580
Ew.

4422
03:25:24,110 --> 03:25:25,370
Is there rats down here?

4423
03:25:35,880 --> 03:25:36,320
Okay.

4424
03:25:36,340 --> 03:25:36,780
Okay.

4425
03:25:36,900 --> 03:25:37,120
Okay.

4426
03:25:38,360 --> 03:25:38,680
Maybe...

4427
03:25:38,680 --> 03:25:40,160
I just have to go back to the...

4428
03:25:40,160 --> 03:25:40,800
What's this one?

4429
03:25:40,940 --> 03:25:42,980
Maybe I just have to go back to the past and get that one rat.

4430
03:25:43,680 --> 03:25:45,200
Maybe it has to be a very specific rat.

4431
03:25:46,880 --> 03:25:47,200
Yeah.

4432
03:25:47,220 --> 03:25:48,360
There was a rat in the house too.

4433
03:25:49,420 --> 03:25:50,940
But I don't think I should go back to my house.

4434
03:25:52,040 --> 03:25:55,320
I could never get dad to tell me what this place was like when he was a kid.

4435
03:25:57,200 --> 03:25:58,040
Now I see why.

4436
03:25:58,400 --> 03:25:58,660
Yeah.

4437
03:25:58,720 --> 03:25:59,800
Everybody's traumatized.

4438
03:26:05,890 --> 03:26:07,050
Let's be careful in here.

4439
03:26:15,470 --> 03:26:15,790
Eee.

4440
03:26:18,430 --> 03:26:20,930
It was in the kitchen room, right?

4441
03:26:22,650 --> 03:26:23,290
In here.

4442
03:26:26,650 --> 03:26:28,410
Oh, I hear something in there but the door won't...

4443
03:26:28,410 --> 03:26:28,650
Oh, wait.

4444
03:26:28,710 --> 03:26:28,930
Sorry.

4445
03:26:29,110 --> 03:26:29,970
This next room.

4446
03:26:30,230 --> 03:26:30,630
Over.

4447
03:26:33,700 --> 03:26:34,100
Oh.

4448
03:26:34,200 --> 03:26:37,160
I hope something doesn't scare me because I think I might actually...

4449
03:26:38,060 --> 03:26:39,200
I have to go to the bathroom.

4450
03:26:39,340 --> 03:26:39,720
I'm just saying.

4451
03:26:39,980 --> 03:26:40,380
Okay.

4452
03:26:40,620 --> 03:26:41,820
How do I get this rat?

4453
03:26:43,260 --> 03:26:43,660
Sprint.

4454
03:26:43,660 --> 03:26:44,040
Sprint.

4455
03:26:44,500 --> 03:26:47,100
Not sure how just yet but I think having a pocket...

4456
03:26:47,100 --> 03:26:47,140
Oh.

4457
03:26:47,140 --> 03:26:48,160
A pocket rat will come in handy.

4458
03:26:48,800 --> 03:26:49,960
Glad I found this trap.

4459
03:26:50,220 --> 03:26:52,260
I don't think it will come out while I'm standing here though.

4460
03:26:52,360 --> 03:26:53,420
Better leave so it comes back.

4461
03:26:54,840 --> 03:26:55,900
Get a pocket rat.

4462
03:26:57,920 --> 03:26:58,320
Oh.

4463
03:26:58,820 --> 03:26:59,220
Snap.

4464
03:27:04,250 --> 03:27:04,650
Eee.

4465
03:27:06,330 --> 03:27:07,430
That was so cheap.

4466
03:27:08,250 --> 03:27:09,050
Great Scott.

4467
03:27:09,430 --> 03:27:10,470
That's a big rat.

4468
03:27:10,730 --> 03:27:12,230
He'll scare somebody for sure.

4469
03:27:12,550 --> 03:27:13,150
All right.

4470
03:27:13,750 --> 03:27:14,410
Oh, God.

4471
03:27:14,490 --> 03:27:14,910
He's coming.

4472
03:27:14,990 --> 03:27:15,210
He's coming.

4473
03:27:15,250 --> 03:27:15,510
He's coming.

4474
03:27:15,590 --> 03:27:16,310
I saw that.

4475
03:27:16,470 --> 03:27:16,670
I saw...

4476
03:27:16,670 --> 03:27:17,290
Did you see the door?

4477
03:27:17,830 --> 03:27:18,390
Let's run.

4478
03:27:18,510 --> 03:27:19,330
Let's just run for it.

4479
03:27:19,810 --> 03:27:20,210
Okay.

4480
03:27:20,210 --> 03:27:20,850
Okay.

4481
03:27:23,450 --> 03:27:24,230
What was that?

4482
03:27:25,810 --> 03:27:26,670
What's that sound?

4483
03:27:29,870 --> 03:27:30,770
What's that sound?

4484
03:27:38,470 --> 03:27:38,990
Okay.

4485
03:27:41,090 --> 03:27:41,610
Okay.

4486
03:27:41,650 --> 03:27:42,390
We're good.

4487
03:27:42,470 --> 03:27:43,190
Everything's fine.

4488
03:27:46,290 --> 03:27:47,470
You're here late, kid.

4489
03:27:48,150 --> 03:27:49,930
We don't sell slices after lunch.

4490
03:27:50,150 --> 03:27:52,470
So if you want pizza, you gotta buy a whole pizza.

4491
03:27:52,810 --> 03:27:53,330
Oh.

4492
03:27:53,450 --> 03:27:54,810
I'm good for now.

4493
03:27:55,550 --> 03:27:56,070
Where's the pizza?

4494
03:27:56,070 --> 03:27:56,190
Really?

4495
03:27:57,010 --> 03:27:57,890
Social butterfly.

4496
03:27:58,590 --> 03:28:00,710
I think I'm talking to too many people.

4497
03:28:03,510 --> 03:28:05,070
Now, where does he want me...

4498
03:28:05,070 --> 03:28:06,610
Where should I release the rat?

4499
03:28:07,450 --> 03:28:08,090
Over here?

4500
03:28:08,550 --> 03:28:09,190
Oh, here.

4501
03:28:09,330 --> 03:28:09,910
By her.

4502
03:28:11,030 --> 03:28:11,470
Probably.

4503
03:28:16,890 --> 03:28:18,790
This should be enough to distract Jeff.

4504
03:28:19,990 --> 03:28:20,430
Down,

4505
03:28:27,730 --> 03:28:27,870
huh?

4506
03:28:28,110 --> 03:28:29,770
You picked the wrong place, pal.

4507
03:28:33,360 --> 03:28:34,680
The kitchen should be free now.

4508
03:28:34,860 --> 03:28:37,740
Just have to sneak in, grab a pizza, and hurry out before Jeff comes.

4509
03:28:38,160 --> 03:28:38,560
Okay.

4510
03:28:40,760 --> 03:28:41,840
Sneaking mission go.

4511
03:28:44,760 --> 03:28:45,360
Sorry, Jeff.

4512
03:28:45,540 --> 03:28:47,060
I'll try to find a way to pay you back.

4513
03:28:48,520 --> 03:28:50,020
What else is in here, though?

4514
03:28:50,820 --> 03:28:51,220
Oh.

4515
03:28:54,930 --> 03:28:56,070
This is a huge freezer.

4516
03:28:56,270 --> 03:28:57,290
Don't want to get locked inside.

4517
03:28:59,090 --> 03:29:00,270
There's a little thing...

4518
03:29:00,270 --> 03:29:01,090
Pulley thing there, too.

4519
03:29:05,070 --> 03:29:07,610
Lure the bird out is the objective.

4520
03:29:07,830 --> 03:29:08,450
That's so funny.

4521
03:29:09,390 --> 03:29:09,790
Sorry.

4522
03:29:09,830 --> 03:29:09,970
It's a bird.

4523
03:29:09,990 --> 03:29:11,870
Jeff is just trying to make a living, man.

4524
03:29:11,950 --> 03:29:13,110
Jeff is just trying to live.

4525
03:29:14,010 --> 03:29:15,650
He's just trying to live.

4526
03:29:17,770 --> 03:29:18,210
Okay.

4527
03:29:18,850 --> 03:29:21,630
So, we lure Chica, and then we...

4528
03:29:24,330 --> 03:29:28,610
And then we get the kid, I guess.

4529
03:29:30,670 --> 03:29:32,830
Oh, these balls here are looking...

4530
03:29:32,830 --> 03:29:33,770
Oh, they're wooden balls.

4531
03:29:33,950 --> 03:29:34,970
I was going to say...

4532
03:29:37,410 --> 03:29:39,510
I was going to say, they're looking a little...

4533
03:29:40,510 --> 03:29:40,870
Gross.

4534
03:29:47,630 --> 03:29:48,650
Let's lure Chica.

4535
03:29:55,230 --> 03:29:56,310
Wait, I can hear somebody.

4536
03:29:57,270 --> 03:29:58,870
I can't tell if it's...

4537
03:30:02,380 --> 03:30:03,900
I need to lure that thing out first.

4538
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:04,180
Okay.

4539
03:30:13,170 --> 03:30:13,790
Pizza here.

4540
03:30:15,590 --> 03:30:16,090
Oh, wait.

4541
03:30:18,670 --> 03:30:19,530
Where does this go?

4542
03:30:21,410 --> 03:30:22,370
Where does this go to?

4543
03:30:24,590 --> 03:30:25,530
Where am I?

4544
03:30:26,790 --> 03:30:27,730
The basement!

4545
03:30:28,450 --> 03:30:29,090
Wow.

4546
03:30:30,150 --> 03:30:31,150
That's handy.

4547
03:30:31,430 --> 03:30:31,790
Okay.

4548
03:30:31,830 --> 03:30:32,310
Good to know.

4549
03:30:33,270 --> 03:30:34,150
All right.

4550
03:30:34,830 --> 03:30:35,790
Let's go back.

4551
03:30:40,700 --> 03:30:41,380
Wait.

4552
03:30:41,580 --> 03:30:44,760
That's not Chica.

4553
03:30:46,820 --> 03:30:48,000
That's not Chica.

4554
03:30:49,380 --> 03:30:50,680
That's the spring trap.

4555
03:30:52,200 --> 03:30:53,260
You hear him?

4556
03:30:54,220 --> 03:30:55,340
That's not Chica.

4557
03:30:58,790 --> 03:30:59,470
Okay.

4558
03:30:59,470 --> 03:30:59,990
Are you tired?

4559
03:31:03,940 --> 03:31:04,620
Don't you get it?

4560
03:31:04,620 --> 03:31:05,520
I think we're good now.

4561
03:31:07,660 --> 03:31:09,560
Where... so I put it on the plate here?

4562
03:31:09,940 --> 03:31:11,400
But like... oh, here we go.

4563
03:31:12,700 --> 03:31:15,060
Not exactly how I imagined feeding a chicken.

4564
03:31:17,920 --> 03:31:18,800
Oh my god, no!

4565
03:31:18,880 --> 03:31:19,500
Hide, please!

4566
03:31:20,000 --> 03:31:20,480
Hide!

4567
03:31:24,440 --> 03:31:25,660
Here she comes!

4568
03:31:30,120 --> 03:31:30,760
Okay, okay.

4569
03:31:36,120 --> 03:31:37,780
When she starts chowing down.

4570
03:31:39,700 --> 03:31:40,980
Make a run for it!

4571
03:31:45,960 --> 03:31:47,200
Oh, a coin.

4572
03:31:48,520 --> 03:31:49,800
Wait, what is that?

4573
03:31:50,000 --> 03:31:51,280
Oh, the phone is ringing.

4574
03:31:52,720 --> 03:31:53,760
Phone guy?!

4575
03:32:13,250 --> 03:32:14,370
There's no kid in here.

4576
03:32:15,810 --> 03:32:16,570
Phone guy!

4577
03:32:24,120 --> 03:32:25,180
Yeah, no, shoot.

4578
03:32:25,840 --> 03:32:27,640
I hear someone down below.

4579
03:32:28,120 --> 03:32:30,200
I feel like I could get swallowed by that open.

4580
03:32:30,860 --> 03:32:32,360
Wait, there's no kid in here though.

4581
03:32:32,680 --> 03:32:34,220
I got baited?

4582
03:32:34,600 --> 03:32:35,620
Oh, there's a kid!

4583
03:32:36,420 --> 03:32:37,320
Oh my god!

4584
03:32:38,940 --> 03:32:39,620
It's Mike!

4585
03:32:40,180 --> 03:32:40,980
Is it gone?

4586
03:32:41,980 --> 03:32:42,680
For now.

4587
03:32:42,860 --> 03:32:43,860
Let's go to the exit.

4588
03:32:46,180 --> 03:32:46,660
Okay.

4589
03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:48,340
My game just saved.

4590
03:32:53,480 --> 03:32:54,600
Wait, map?

4591
03:32:57,440 --> 03:32:58,400
From here.

4592
03:33:01,540 --> 03:33:01,860
Oh!

4593
03:33:02,800 --> 03:33:03,380
Oh my god!

4594
03:33:03,420 --> 03:33:03,920
Oh my god!

4595
03:33:03,980 --> 03:33:04,320
Oh my god!

4596
03:33:04,360 --> 03:33:04,700
Oh my god!

4597
03:33:05,460 --> 03:33:05,780
Aeee!

4598
03:33:05,900 --> 03:33:06,540
Bow, bow, bow...

4599
03:33:08,800 --> 03:33:10,180
Is he gonna to come down this way?

4600
03:33:14,190 --> 03:33:15,390
Wait, did he just go to the entrance?

4601
03:33:17,950 --> 03:33:18,270
Wait!

4602
03:33:26,880 --> 03:33:28,060
I think I just heard him leave.

4603
03:33:29,660 --> 03:33:30,780
I think I just heard him leave.

4604
03:33:34,180 --> 03:33:35,180
How did you live?

4605
03:33:36,140 --> 03:33:37,160
How did you survive?

4606
03:33:38,640 --> 03:33:39,400
Aren't you coming?

4607
03:33:40,280 --> 03:33:41,460
No, I'm looking for my dad.

4608
03:33:41,940 --> 03:33:43,800
He's wearing a blue shirt and has brown hair.

4609
03:33:43,980 --> 03:33:44,580
Have you seen him?

4610
03:33:45,300 --> 03:33:45,680
No.

4611
03:33:45,800 --> 03:33:46,720
Have you seen Chip?

4612
03:33:46,920 --> 03:33:48,840
We were in the arcade when the power went out.

4613
03:33:49,620 --> 03:33:50,500
No, I haven't.

4614
03:33:50,600 --> 03:33:51,940
Do you think he's...

4615
03:33:52,460 --> 03:33:52,840
Mikey,

4616
03:33:56,650 --> 03:33:57,290
you coward!

4617
03:33:57,950 --> 03:33:59,350
Mikey, you little shit!

4618
03:33:59,830 --> 03:34:00,570
How could you?

4619
03:34:02,890 --> 03:34:03,270
Mikey!

4620
03:34:04,690 --> 03:34:06,110
Mikey, how could you do this to me?

4621
03:34:16,400 --> 03:34:17,900
Oh, the objective was to escape.

4622
03:34:18,120 --> 03:34:18,420
Oh no!

4623
03:34:18,520 --> 03:34:19,360
Wait, I should have left!

4624
03:34:21,820 --> 03:34:22,140
Oh,

4625
03:34:32,150 --> 03:34:33,810
I didn't realize I was supposed to go to the ball pit.

4626
03:34:33,910 --> 03:34:34,410
That's my fault.

4627
03:34:34,650 --> 03:34:35,790
I thought I was just going to run.

4628
03:34:39,030 --> 03:34:41,270
Wait... How... Wait, how far back am I?

4629
03:34:43,110 --> 03:34:44,010
Oh, okay, okay.

4630
03:34:44,050 --> 03:34:44,690
This isn't so bad.

4631
03:34:44,850 --> 03:34:45,490
This could be worse.

4632
03:34:45,570 --> 03:34:46,030
This could be worse.

4633
03:34:58,880 --> 03:35:00,160
I think we can go in.

4634
03:35:00,180 --> 03:35:00,480
I think we can go in there now.

4635
03:35:04,200 --> 03:35:06,520
Auto-save saved your butt for real.

4636
03:35:07,880 --> 03:35:08,400
Okay.

4637
03:35:08,460 --> 03:35:09,480
Screw you, Mikey!

4638
03:35:17,550 --> 03:35:20,590
The way he just stares at his friend leaving him.

4639
03:35:21,270 --> 03:35:22,870
Abandoning him is so sad.

4640
03:35:23,870 --> 03:35:24,930
Go, go, go!

4641
03:35:28,770 --> 03:35:29,290
Escape!

4642
03:35:29,290 --> 03:35:29,970
Don't trip.

4643
03:35:30,110 --> 03:35:30,990
Don't trip, Mikey.

4644
03:35:31,130 --> 03:35:31,910
I mean Ozzy.

4645
03:35:31,910 --> 03:35:32,430
Ozzy.

4646
03:35:33,210 --> 03:35:34,870
I'm getting the children confused.

4647
03:35:39,030 --> 03:35:39,550
Man,

4648
03:35:43,450 --> 03:35:44,530
that was way too close.

4649
03:35:44,790 --> 03:35:46,090
Why can't I find him?

4650
03:35:46,170 --> 03:35:47,270
Where haven't I looked yet?

4651
03:35:49,670 --> 03:35:50,790
Time to go home.

4652
03:35:54,960 --> 03:35:56,040
Ozzy, Ozzy, Oz.

4653
03:35:56,200 --> 03:35:56,420
Yay!

4654
03:35:56,560 --> 03:35:57,020
Day 3!

4655
03:35:59,300 --> 03:35:59,820
Nice.

4656
03:36:01,880 --> 03:36:02,880
Apparently slipped.

4657
03:36:03,020 --> 03:36:03,880
Why can't I...

4658
03:36:08,600 --> 03:36:10,080
What does it want now?

4659
03:36:10,580 --> 03:36:11,900
Lady Winter, welcome to the membership.

4660
03:36:11,920 --> 03:36:12,560
Thank you.

4661
03:36:15,260 --> 03:36:16,520
I'm going to pet my cat.

4662
03:36:19,660 --> 03:36:24,880
Well guys, I think that's where I will leave it off for today.

4663
03:36:25,820 --> 03:36:28,880
Probably pick it back up later this week.

4664
03:36:28,880 --> 03:36:29,900
What's today?

4665
03:36:32,240 --> 03:36:35,920
It's Monday night for you guys.

4666
03:36:35,980 --> 03:36:37,720
Tuesday morning for me.

4667
03:36:40,100 --> 03:36:42,180
Tomorrow, I have an off collab.

4668
03:36:42,520 --> 03:36:49,120
So I will be technically streaming, but not on my channel.

4669
03:36:49,220 --> 03:36:50,620
It will be on the other channel.

4670
03:36:51,600 --> 03:36:53,900
I don't know if they've announced it yet or not.

4671
03:36:57,740 --> 03:36:58,860
I don't know if they've announced it yet or not.

4672
03:37:00,160 --> 03:37:00,920
But...

4673
03:37:04,490 --> 03:37:13,110
I'm going to talk to her and see if we're good to announce it.

4674
03:37:14,290 --> 03:37:15,790
Which other channel?

4675
03:37:15,970 --> 03:37:16,730
Her channel!

4676
03:37:17,570 --> 03:37:18,530
Her channel.

4677
03:37:22,770 --> 03:37:24,290
So... yeah.

4678
03:37:27,870 --> 03:37:31,230
But I'll post it as soon as possible.

4679
03:37:31,390 --> 03:37:31,990
Like ASAP.

4680
03:37:33,310 --> 03:37:34,590
ASAP, I will post it.

4681
03:37:36,870 --> 03:37:40,430
I'm not a big FNAF fan, but this game looks fun and I love the sprite work in it.

4682
03:37:40,510 --> 03:37:40,990
Thanks for the stream.

4683
03:37:41,130 --> 03:37:41,310
Yeah!

4684
03:37:41,650 --> 03:37:42,450
Thanks, Irlen!

4685
03:37:43,030 --> 03:37:43,650
Me too.

4686
03:37:43,810 --> 03:37:44,230
So fun.

4687
03:37:47,010 --> 03:37:47,810
A woman?

4688
03:37:48,030 --> 03:37:48,430
Yeah.

4689
03:37:48,550 --> 03:37:49,750
A pretty lady.

4690
03:37:50,710 --> 03:37:51,810
A pretty lady.

4691
03:37:55,490 --> 03:37:55,890
She's...

4692
03:37:58,010 --> 03:37:59,590
She's a fiery lady.

4693
03:38:01,790 --> 03:38:04,570
I'm looking at the right side of the screen and I see Foxy there.

4694
03:38:04,910 --> 03:38:07,530
Or at least something Foxy's shot of.

4695
03:38:14,330 --> 03:38:15,210
But... yeah.

4696
03:38:18,830 --> 03:38:21,730
We'll be hanging out and we got some stuff to do.

4697
03:38:21,870 --> 03:38:22,630
Some stuff to...

4698
03:38:23,850 --> 03:38:24,770
to plant.

4699
03:38:25,770 --> 03:38:26,230
So...

4700
03:38:26,230 --> 03:38:27,850
Thank you guys for watching.

4701
03:38:28,070 --> 03:38:30,470
I've got to take a shower and get ready for my meeting.

4702
03:38:31,830 --> 03:38:33,270
But I will see you guys.

4703
03:38:34,150 --> 03:38:34,610
Um...

4704
03:38:35,210 --> 03:38:35,490
Tomorrow.

4705
03:38:36,450 --> 03:38:37,870
At the collab, hopefully.

4706
03:38:39,090 --> 03:38:39,530
Hopefully.

4707
03:38:40,390 --> 03:38:40,830
Right?

4708
03:38:41,190 --> 03:38:41,830
I hope.

4709
03:38:42,250 --> 03:38:44,030
But like I said, I'll post it on Twitter.

4710
03:38:44,250 --> 03:38:44,930
I'll post it.

4711
03:38:45,890 --> 03:38:47,990
I'm sorry that I haven't got my schedule out yet.

4712
03:38:49,130 --> 03:38:50,350
I will try and do that.

4713
03:38:50,530 --> 03:38:50,970
Today.

4714
03:38:51,310 --> 03:38:52,470
Like ASAP.

4715
03:38:52,790 --> 03:38:53,950
Hopefully after my meeting.

4716
03:38:54,070 --> 03:38:54,570
Or something.

4717
03:38:54,910 --> 03:38:55,650
I'll get it done.

4718
03:38:57,790 --> 03:38:59,270
My cat's so needy.

4719
03:39:01,730 --> 03:39:02,170
Takezoro!

4720
03:39:02,350 --> 03:39:03,450
Thanks for the five you did!

4721
03:39:03,450 --> 03:39:04,710
Thank you!

4722
03:39:04,950 --> 03:39:05,430
Thank you!

4723
03:39:05,550 --> 03:39:05,890
Thank you!

4724
03:39:06,370 --> 03:39:06,770
Um...

4725
03:39:06,770 --> 03:39:09,430
I know that I haven't been very good with posting schedules lately.

4726
03:39:09,590 --> 03:39:10,250
I'm so sorry.

4727
03:39:10,430 --> 03:39:10,810
Um...

4728
03:39:10,810 --> 03:39:13,350
Japan is really kind of kicking my butt.

4729
03:39:13,550 --> 03:39:13,950
But...

4730
03:39:13,950 --> 03:39:14,550
BUT!

4731
03:39:15,070 --> 03:39:17,270
I'm glad that I can stream at least even a little bit.

4732
03:39:17,410 --> 03:39:17,970
Thanks for the stream!

4733
03:39:18,110 --> 03:39:18,570
Thank you!

4734
03:39:19,030 --> 03:39:19,570
Thank you!

4735
03:39:19,570 --> 03:39:19,890
Thank you!

4736
03:39:20,350 --> 03:39:20,750
Um...

4737
03:39:20,750 --> 03:39:22,530
I know that I've been having to stream less.

4738
03:39:23,730 --> 03:39:24,130
Um...

4739
03:39:24,130 --> 03:39:24,750
But...

4740
03:39:24,750 --> 03:39:25,770
You know...

4741
03:39:25,770 --> 03:39:28,430
One was an off-collab and then the next one's an off-collab too.

4742
03:39:28,970 --> 03:39:29,370
So...

4743
03:39:30,450 --> 03:39:31,070
You know...

4744
03:39:31,070 --> 03:39:31,830
I'm still streaming.

4745
03:39:31,850 --> 03:39:33,250
Just in different places.

4746
03:39:33,250 --> 03:39:34,210
Thanks for the stream.

4747
03:39:34,430 --> 03:39:35,090
You're welcome.

4748
03:39:35,850 --> 03:39:37,410
Keep on dreaming, buddy.

4749
03:39:41,430 --> 03:39:44,830
Ain't gonna happen, but just keep on dreaming, buddy.

4750
03:39:45,030 --> 03:39:46,110
Keep on dreaming.

4751
03:39:46,330 --> 03:39:47,970
Don't let go of your dreams.

4752
03:39:50,070 --> 03:39:51,710
Thank you, guys!

4753
03:39:53,370 --> 03:39:54,550
Thank you so much!

4754
03:39:54,610 --> 03:39:56,450
And I'll see you next time!

4755
03:39:57,750 --> 03:39:58,050
Meow!

4756
03:39:58,350 --> 03:39:58,810
Meow!

4757
03:39:59,210 --> 03:39:59,930
Bye-bye!

4758
03:40:00,170 --> 03:40:01,010
Bye-bye!

4759
03:40:01,010 --> 03:40:01,530
Bye-bye!

4760
03:40:01,530 --> 03:40:02,010
Oh, wait.

4761
03:40:02,050 --> 03:40:02,310
Hold on.

4762
03:40:02,670 --> 03:40:03,610
So I can...

4763
03:40:04,370 --> 03:40:07,170
I didn't think of a fanservice thing, though.

4764
03:40:12,010 --> 03:40:12,290
Mmm...

4765
03:40:15,250 --> 03:40:15,810
Mmm...

4766
03:40:16,410 --> 03:40:16,970
Um...

4767
03:40:19,390 --> 03:40:20,430
Hey, buddy.

4768
03:40:22,530 --> 03:40:23,090
You...

4769
03:40:34,830 --> 03:40:35,390
You...

4770
03:40:37,830 --> 03:40:38,390
Mmm...

4771
03:40:38,390 --> 03:40:38,950
No!

4772
03:40:40,630 --> 03:40:42,130
Ducky, thanks for the buy gifted!

4773
03:40:42,290 --> 03:40:42,790
Bye!

4774
03:40:45,490 --> 03:40:46,890
Bye!

4775
03:40:52,360 --> 03:40:55,260
Take your meds!

4776
03:40:55,800 --> 03:40:57,200
Bye!!!

4777
03:40:57,200 --> 03:40:57,820
What the?

4778
03:40:58,320 --> 03:40:58,380
Oh!
