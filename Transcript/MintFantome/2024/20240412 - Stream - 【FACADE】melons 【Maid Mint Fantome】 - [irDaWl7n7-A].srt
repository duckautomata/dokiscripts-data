I opened memberships yesterday.

17
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,220
I didn't even tell anyone and people found out somehow,
which is so crazy.

18
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,420
But welcome to membership.

19
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,240

Anyway, of course, there's no...

25
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:22,060
No pressure to donate as usual and no pressure to join or
anything like that.

26
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,900
And for anyone who says that it's too cheap, screw you.

27
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,580
For anyone who says raise the price, no.

28
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,060
What's wrong with you?

29
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,480
You say what's wrong with me and I say what's wrong with
you?

30
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,840
I ask, what is wrong with you?

31
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:51,260
i i mentioned it kind of before briefly i said that um you
know for memberships i planned on uh making them a lower

32
00:04:51,260 --> 00:05:03,320
tier or lower to a lower price because um because uh since i
have the podcast uh to be honest i won't be able to focus so

33
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,700
much on like membership content it kind of was like you know
you'll get you'll get some membership streams oh my gosh the

34
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,020
50.

35
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,500
thank you guys thank you some membership streams of course
but

36
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:35,200
it's like mostly for the emotes and then once I get the
Minecraft server set up that access to that yeah no pressure

37
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:46,460
of course you guys are making me feel like I need to do more
because you guys are joining so fast and then gifting so

38
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,940

40
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:05,300
Also, I wanna say a little bit today, I don't know, I have
not been feeling so great lately.

41
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,080
Like just until up until this stream, my stomach was killing
me again.

42
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:22,940
I think I am I am possessing some people that are not eating
healthily so please think of your local ghost maid and eat

43
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:33,760
well so that if I possess you you don't hurt me in return
you know I think part of it is stress though just because

44
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:45,580
you know I kind of came back from Japan and didn't didn't
have any time to rest when came back home and uh and also i

45
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:53,740
don't know early okay have you guys ever heard okay so this
is for all you cat owners out there if you weren't aware if

46
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:02,840
you ever smell your cat and they smell a little bit sweet
then you're then like kind of like a maple syrup it's like

47
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:11,040
it could be like an actual medical condition and i smelled
my cat's head and i was just like why do you smell so sweet

48
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:18,940
what did you get into and then I was like oh and I
remembered so tomorrow I have to call the vet and schedule a

49
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:29,120
yeah it could be diabetes like a feline diabetes or it could
be like you know I looked it up because I wasn't aware of

50
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,600
the other things but it could be also a kidney thing or a
skin thing and he has been having like some issues with his

51
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:47,140
ear so I'm hoping it's the skin thing thing to take care of
but he's gonna be okay um because i'm gonna take him to the

52
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:53,580
vet and we're gonna get him all checked out and but it does
stress me out a little bit if he's good or not you know what

Pliskin?

111
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,880
That's so funny.

112
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:56,420
I thought when I tested this out, I just picked Adam, but I
thought oh, it does say please choose a name.

113
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,220
Type the first letter, scroll with the arrow keys, press
enter to begin.

114
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,880
It does say that entirely.

115
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:11,100
And I just I thought maybe I could type in my name and I was
like will they say it like is there like an in-game voice

116
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:18,700
thing kind of like you know and like certain some uh what's
the word some gotcha games you type in your name and it'll

117
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:30,000
be like mint hello how are you mint you know Godzilla oh my
god blue archive

118
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,260
So let's look at the instructions real quick.

119
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,860
Type to speak to the character at any time.

120
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,120
Move around with the arrow.

121
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,480
Look at this keyboard.

122
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,640
Sorry.

123
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,000
If I move off the screen, it's because I have the other
window open like to see.

124
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,740
Type to speak to the characters at any time.

125
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,340
Move around with arrow keys.

126
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,380
Pick up and use objects with the mouse.

127
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,420
Actually, I wonder if there's another way that I can capture
this.

128
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,620
I wonder if I do window capture instead if it will allow me
to see it.

129
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,340
Do you guys mind?

130
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,680
Sorry, I totally should have.

131
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,120
I didn't think it would be an issue.

132
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,500
I should have totally done it off stream.

133
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,360
I should have, I was like, oh, maybe it's because I messed
with something.

134
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,380
I was doing a couple of setting things.

135
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,120
Go ahead.

136
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,840
Go ahead.

137
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,760
Okay, thank you guys.

138
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,280
It's not going to take long.

139
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,300
Let's see.

140
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,720
Window capture.

141
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,520

Um, okay.

146
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,380
It's okay because there's a little scene at the beginning
too we can watch.

147
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,410
And the cursor's fixed!

148
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,350
Look at that!

149
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,610

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,840
There.

152
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,500

We are so back, baby!

154
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,720

Yeah.

165
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,230

suspicious out there

168
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:49,190
facade look our little happy happy couple question mark

169
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,710
Maybe he's just shy.

170
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,170
I also struggle with talking on the phone.

171
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,990
Thank you guys for all the super chats.

172
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,930
Thank you.

173
00:17:59,450 --> 00:17:59,950
Thank you.

174
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,070
Thank you.

175
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,490
And let's see.

176
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,430
It works!

177
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:03,830
Okay.

178
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,110
There is no problem that I can't solve.

179
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,070
I'm a genius!

180
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,650
Okay, let's see the hints.

181
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,410
Oh, wow.

182
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,150
This is a lot.

183
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:14,410
Okay.

184
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,750
Grace and Trip are in a desperate situation.

185
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,310
They need you.

186
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,850
You could influence them in several ways.

187
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:21,690
Exactly.

188
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,490
how is up to you.

189
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,370
One approach is to try to help them, to get them to work
through their problems.

190
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:33,350
Or you could try to provoke and upset them, even be cruel if
you want.

191
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,390
You can try to dig under the surface to expose the secrets
they're hiding.

192
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,310
Sometimes it's necessary to talk fast and interrupt grace
and trip to get a word in.

193
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,470
They tend to respond to agreement and disagreement.

194
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,370
Praise, criticism, flirtation.

195
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,570
References to relationship topics such as divorce and

196
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:09,410
questions about their life explanations and advice and so on
as the tension builds they may try to force you to take

197
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:16,050
sides eventually they may seek your advice to get you to
tell them what's wrong with them depending on what you say

198
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:23,430
or do will determine if they stay together or not facade
needs to be replayed several times to experience the

199
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:35,270
variation in the drama for more detailed hints blah blah the
mouse is oh wait it looks good for you guys it is cursed for

trapping me Oh, never mind.

203
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,790
Wait, why am I moving back?

204
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,170
Give me a second.

205
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,190
Hello?

206
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,710

207
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:10,930

208
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,410

210
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,010
Hey!

211
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,790
I thought I heard someone out here.

212
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,750
Great to see you.

213
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,450
It's been a while.

214
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,090
How's it going?

215
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:18,990
Wait.

216
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,530
Hold on.

217
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,210
How do I move?

218
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,050
Oh, here we go.

219
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,110
Well, come on in.

220
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:25,810
Hello!

221
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,570
Don't worry.

222
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,950
Let me go get Grace.

223
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,470
Okay.

224
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,710
Oh, I'm going to come in.

225
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,910
No, no, here we are.

226
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,630
Oh, my God.

227
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,470
Gonzalo.

228
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,310

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,370

230

Oh, God.

231
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,690
It's been such a long time.

232
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:42,530

233
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,830

235
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,110

236
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,010

237
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,230

We- why is there everyone talking over each other?

254
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,230
It's so chaos.

255
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,030
Whoa, I just realized something.

256
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,590
What?

257
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,370
Well, tonight is special.

258
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,970
Gonzalo, remember?

259
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,430
It was almost exactly 10 years ago tonight that you
introduced us.

260
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,010
Senior year of college.

261
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:25,950
Oh, geez.

262
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,290
Remember that?

263
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,630
I remember.

264
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,430
We really want to thank you for years and years of pain.

265
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,070
Agony.

266
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,150
Haunting.

267
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,830
Why do they look at each other like that?

268
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,090
It's great you to be here tonight.

269
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:48,510
What are you?

270
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,970
What is that?

271
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:55,550
Oh, that's just a little joke advice giver toy thing that I
like to consult every now and then.

272
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,630
What?

273
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,770
When I need a little guidance.

274
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,150
His mother gave that to him.

275
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,670
Stopping stuffer.

276
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,090
Aww.

277
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:03,950
Aww.

278
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,750
I'm gonna fix us some drinks.

279
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,290
Well, we should drink.

280
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,950
We should have something fun.

281
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,330
Like Sangria?

282
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:12,990
Sangria.

283
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,190
Everybody tells me I fix the best drinks, so I'm sure you're
gonna love this.

284
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,390
Now, Tripp, don't get too worked up with the drinks tonight.

285
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,130
I'm gonna puke.

286
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:22,990
No.

287
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,370
Tripp, don't pressure our friend, okay?

288
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,110
Gonzalo.

289
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,250
Maybe you'd like some juice or mineral water.

290
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,150
Oh, come on.

291
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:44,590

Yes.

296
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,830
I'm hoping you can help me understand where I went wrong
with my new decorating.

297
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,590
Your decorating is beautiful.

298
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,590
All right, Grace, yours is ready.

299
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,250
Thanks.

300
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:13,850
Thanks.

301
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,970
See, I told you you would like it.

302
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:15,370
Yeah.

303
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,350
There's nothing wrong with it.

304
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,150
Yeah, that's what I said.

305
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,890
So, about my decorating.

306
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,430
That's what I...

307
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,650
You know, when I look at this wedding picture hanging here
in this room.

308
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,030
Do you have anime figures?

309
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,550
Yeah.

310
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,410
Oh, God.

311
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,230
It's impressive.

312
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,390
Even after a full day's work, it's only magazine ads, great.

313
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:38,430
somehow finds the time to decorate haha I guess it's just
the artist in me dying to get out this is yours oh it tastes

314
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:46,770
good so about this wedding picture here it obviously just
does not go anymore what do you mean with my new decorating

315
00:24:46,770 --> 00:25:00,530
at all oh grace whoa it's like distorting whoa whoa I think
it's melting ah yes I've been waiting for someone oh but I I

316
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,150
liked what you said about my decorating.

317
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,430
Besides, I'm redoing it all this week.

318
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,110
What do you mean?

319
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,950
You've been waiting for someone to say that.

320
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,470
Well, you and I are getting along better tonight than I
first thought.

321
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,530
Aren't we friends?

322
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,890
Like, I'm confused.

323
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,350
Oh, God.

324
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,150
Oh, thanks.

325
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,910
Oh, that's nice, Grace.

326
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,950
Our friend seems happy to see you again after so long.

327
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,390
What?

328
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,650
Uh-oh.

329
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,930
Music's getting kind of great.

330
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,310
Have you noticed we're fighting in front of our friend?

331
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:29,950
Grace.

332
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,710
on that kind of statement is not helpful.

333
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,890
I'm going to check there's nothing wrong with disagreeing in
front of our friend.

334
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:36,930
We're not disagreeing.

335
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,830
Shut up.

336
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,910
Shut up.

337
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,150
That's...

338
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:43,930
Whoa.

339
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,130
Are you sick?

340
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,630
Are you sick?

341
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,790
Why are you coughing?

342
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,410
Why are they so offended?

343
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,910
What did you...

344
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,180
He's...

345
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:00,930
Mellon.

346
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,050
Mellon.

347
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,730
You're being...

348
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,310
Mellon.

349
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,240
Okay.

350
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,940
Gonzalo, I think this evening is over.

351
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:13,780
You've got to leave.

352
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,120
Oh!

353
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,220
Oh, no!

354
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,280
You'll be fine.

355
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,620
You should just go.

356
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,240
No!

357
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,580
I'm sorry, Tripp.

358
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,360
I didn't mean it.

359
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,060
I didn't mean it.

360
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,040
For some reason, Mellon just makes them, like, kick you out.

361
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,560
generated stage play.

362
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, cancel, cancel, cancel.

363
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,440
It like opened up this own document.

364
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,140
That's so funny.

365
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,180
Wow, guys, how we get a good feel about that one?

366
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,300
I don't know what.

367
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,220
Melon.

368
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,920
Gonzalo, get out of here.

369
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,580
Get out of here.

370
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,600
How do we feel about that?

371
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,360
How are we feeling?

372
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,860
I think, um, I don't... That's... You need to leave.

373
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,460
Okay, replay.

374
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,220
Back to main menu.

375
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,860
To replay, please exit and...

376
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,360
No way.

377
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,380
What?

378
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,380
I have to exit every...

379
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,280
I have to relaunch it every time.

380
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,940
No way!

381
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,200
Aw.

382
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,020
Oh, an electronic tip jar.

383
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,560

It'd be great.

We could try that too.

397
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,180
We have every scenario we'd ever want to do.

398
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,720
So good.

399
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,780
You could just combine around eight or something.

400
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,840
Can I skip this?

401
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:45,620
Okay.

402
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,500
I think I can.

403
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,720
I think I just did.

404
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,740
Or I broke the game.

405
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,160
Never mind.

406
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,760
Look at our happy couple.

407
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,200
Yeah, Grace, yeah, Trip.

408
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,920
I thought that was like her boyfriend or something that I
called.

409
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,380
I was really scared for them.

410
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,860
I was scared.

411
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,400
Like, what if she's been seeing another man?

412
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,620
Oh, my gosh.

413
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,810
No, how do I get to Gonzalo again?

00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,210

421
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,650

Oh, you'll never guess where I took that picture.

442
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,430
Is this really something you want to brag about, Trip?

443
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,590
Why not?

444
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,490

Yeah, yeah, I've got to tell you about Italy.

450
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:00,950
Yes.

451
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,310
Trip, we don't want to depress our guests.

452
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,890
Damn it, Grace, would it kill you to be positive for once?

453
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,070
Shut up, Grace.

454
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,210
Italy!

455
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,450
That's...

456
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,610
Um...

457
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:24,730
Gonzalo.

458
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,930
Tell me about Italy.

459
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,150
You had me going there for a sec.

460
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,030
Tell me.

461
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,410
We're afraid to push your luck.

462
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,330
Mess with us.

463
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,130
You're crazy, you know that?

464
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,030
This is going well.

465
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,070
Anyway, what were we talking about?

466
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:43,550
Italy.

467
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,850
I think I've said Italy five times now.

468
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:46,890
Please.

469
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,730
So, about my decorating?

470
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,170
What?

471
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,630
We were not talking about that!

472
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,090
I've been collecting these little glass sculptures for a
long time now.

473
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,910
Everybody always comments on Grace's sculptures.

474
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,830
But now when I look at them, they give me such a headache.

475
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,730
I prefer anime.

476
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:02,830
Ah, yes.

477
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,470
I've been waiting.

478
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:10,210
for someone to say that what are you talking about trip he
is just being honest about my decorating which I appreciate

479
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:23,290
I am being honest but I still think this looks fine well you
two are all chummy already that's hmm Gonzalo seeing you

480
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:30,710

481
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,770
something what yeah well Actually, tonight's a special
night.

482
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,170
We should celebrate, in fact.

483
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,130
What do you mean?

484
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,110
Gonzalo.

485
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:38,650
Yes.

486
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,930
Remember, it was almost exactly 10 years ago tonight that
you introduced us?

487
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:42,810
Oh, I can hug him.

488
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,210
You're hugging me.

489
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,150
That's kind of you.

490
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,950
I'm sure Tripp's happy to get...

491
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,490
Oh, you're hugging me.

492
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:49,310
Oh.

493
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,710
That's nice, Grace.

494
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,110
Our friend seems to be...

495
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,310
Oh.

496
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,930
Oh, wow.

497
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,650
Nade, Nade.

498
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,510
You seem to remember how much Tripp left getting attention.

499
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,550
I can't kiss him!

500
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,020
I'm not going to let go.

501
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,640
Keep going.

502
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,720
All right.

503
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,740
Gonzalo, that's it.

504
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:15,520
No!

505
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,880
I thought you were down to clown, Tripp.

506
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,480
Don't look at me like that while you kick me out.

507
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,480
No, I have to restart the game again.

508
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,640
Please!

509
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,940
No, Tripp!

510
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:44,460
He felt something, you know, and so he felt that maybe if he
didn't kick me out something new would start after this he

511
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:56,700
has like a little musical theater moment he's just like I
never knew that you saw me like that but from this moment I

512
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:07,280

Is Grace evil?

565
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:38,190

00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:42,810
It can't be that.

569
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,150
It has to be yes or no question.

570
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:54,070

knows

571

00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,710
Adam, you're always so sweet.

583
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,030
Grace, I'm giving you the first glass.

584
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,450
Why'd you cut her off like that?

585
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:47,950
Thanks.

586
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,570
Nope, that glass is mine.

587
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,130
Adam, I was going.

588
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,130
Oh, I'll get it.

589
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:53,990
No, no, no, no.

590
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:54,750
Sippy, sippy.

591
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,010
We can let the answering machine get it.

592
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,710
You know what, I'm just gonna put this in the bathroom.

593
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,930
How did you walk in front of us?

594
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:00,910
Sippy, sippy.

595
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,390
I'm drunk.

596
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,970
Oh yeah, you know, I think I'll fix you a real drink in not
too long.

597
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,950
Anyhow, Chip's parents.

598
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,510
So sweet people, we're really down to earth.

599
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,970
Oh my god, everyone is talking, please!

600
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,470
Travis, are you there?

601
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,690
It's your mother.

602
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:21,310
Oh.

603
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,370
I haven't heard from you in grace in a while.

604
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,750
Take a look at this photo I just put up for you.

605
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,650
from our trip to Italy.

606
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,150
I'm just calling to find out if you're settled in and your
new apartment.

607
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,910
That's all.

608
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,670
Adam, come over here and sit on my couch with me.

609
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,170
No, I know you're traveling a lot these days.

610
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,190
Everybody's talking!

611
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,510
Who is Travis?

612
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,810
Oh, Trip, don't put our friend on the spot like that.

613
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,310
Well, actually, this trip to Italy was meant to be our
second honeymoon.

614
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,810
Trip, don't exaggerate.

615
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,950
It was simply a weekend getaway.

616
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,270
So, in a word, this says...

617
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,510
It says...

618
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:54,590
Love.

619
00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:09,670

trip's full name oh romance it says romance romance of

00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:27,410

could be good one yeah yeah why why am I the awkward one

621
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:37,650
here Adam maybe you didn't come here to hear this what oh
trip there's nothing wrong with disagreeing in front of

And it's true.

624
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,310
I kind of enjoy it, but...

625
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:58,890
Yeah, it's great.

626
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:02,230
Everybody loves it when they come in and see our latest
decoration scheme.

627
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:07,370
But, Adam, you have to look at this room and admit it looks
terrible.

628
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,030
Grace, I mean, look around.

629
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,270
This room is... It's hideous.

630
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,690
Ah, yeah.

631
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:13,730
It looks great.

632
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,270
Adam, I knew you'd like it.

633
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:15,550
Yeah.

634
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,810
See, Grace, you don't realize how good all this looks.

635
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:18,470
I mean, it's a little empty.

636
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,390
Could use some more wall scrolls or something.

637
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,450
So, about my decorating.

638
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:28,430
You know, at work I waste all day designing ads for
apartments like this.

639
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:28,890
Uh-huh.

640
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,030
And it makes me think, I want this style for my apartment.

641
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:32,390
Yeah?

642
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,850
This style makes me feel like I'm inside one of your ads.

643
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,350
It's great.

644
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,150
Oh, I'm sitting.

645
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,770
Damn it, I'm wrong.

646
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,970
It's just not coming together at all.

647
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:40,510
That's okay.

648
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,350
Not coming together?

649
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:41,830
What?

650
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,370
What's going on?

651
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,670
Why is she so angry?

652
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,230
Oh, you're hugging me.

653
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,310
Ah, it's good to see you two bonding again.

654
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:56,650
I'm coming.

655
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,930
Well, you're really affectionate tonight, aren't you?

656
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,670
I'm drunk.

657
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,250
She's a villain.

658
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,330
I bet I can return most of this and start over again on this
room.

659
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:12,190
Are you okay?

660
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,750
I love this.

661
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,890
No, I can't say love or I'll still say I'm...

662
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:17,730
They think I'm loving.

663
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:21,050
The room looks great.

664
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:22,430
What?

665
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:23,330
Aha.

666
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:24,410
I knew it.

667
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,410
I was right, Grace.

668
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,270
You're the only one unhappy with your decorating.

669
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,610
No, decorating is not.

670
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,230
It's not.

671
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,170
Grace, come on.

672
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,190
You're so good at it.

673
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:34,770
You're so good.

674
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,910
Just like you're good at your job.

675
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:36,970
You design great magazines.

676
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:37,970
Oh my god, we're helping you guys.

677
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:38,950
I think we're actually helping.

678
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,630
You are impossible.

679
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:41,670
Or not.

680
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,990
I'm never happy.

681
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:44,810
Trip our whole marriage.

682
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:45,210
I don't think we're helping.

683
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,470
I don't think we're helping.

684
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:47,510
What?

685
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:48,630
He's not doing anything.

686
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:49,690
What's wrong, Grace?

687
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:50,390
What's wrong?

688
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:51,050
Adam.

689
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,210
I...

690
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,210
And you.

691
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,950
I can predict what you'll say.

692
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:56,310
Me?

693
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,750
I'm so positive tonight.

694
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,190
It's driving me crazy.

695
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,250
Um, uh, what should I say, you guys?

696
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,390
More real.

697
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,130
I like my fancy drinks, okay?

698
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:08,570
Oh, my God.

699
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:09,330
What should I say?

700
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:10,350
I like the good things in life.

701
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,730
Does that make me a bad person?

702
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:12,750
They're just drinks.

703
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,530
Goddamn second honeymoon.

704
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,930
You never call me when you're on business trips.

705
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:18,850
You never call me.

706
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:19,470
You know that?

707
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,470
Um, um, what do I say?

708
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,970
Something positive?

709
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:24,490
Okay, you know what?

710
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,970
I'll take another drink.

711
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,030
I need to ask you something.

712
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:28,610
Grace.

713
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,050
Trip, let me ask our guest a question.

714
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,230
Never mind, they ignored me.

715
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:34,310
Adam.

716
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:34,950
Yes.

717
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:35,830
Yes or no?

718
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:36,030
Oh.

719
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:41,750
In a marriage, shouldn't you try to help the other person
get what they want?

720
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:43,790
What?

721
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:49,430
I mean, marriage is supposed to be about what the other
person wants, not what you want, right?

722
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:50,770
Yes or no?

723
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,990
Um, uh, yes.

724
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:07,310
agree with her why are you upset should oh yeah that's
that's fine that's fine you should both try so hard to reach

729
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:52,490

talking about me again are we she's getting the gun race we

00:45:52,490 --> 00:46:01,170

pretending anymore i can't take it stay get get away from

732
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:18,570
what did i do oh

733
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:29,480
man there's they are so we were helping what's wrong with
being a little positive

734
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,330
Is there actually a good ending?

735
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:36,430
I have no idea.

736
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:39,690
The fact that each scenario is different too is crazy.

737
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:43,070
My drink, hey at least we finished our drink, right?

738
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:48,250
I think I should be like a hostage negotiator.

739
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:57,850
I think actually maybe this game will train you for hostage
negotiation situations because only the bad outcomes happen.

740
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:01,630
and so it trains you to not say those things

741
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:12,970
what if i say oh my god i'm gonna okay i'm gonna go in with
this approach i'm gonna say i just got a new job as a

742
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:27,410
marriage counselor then they feel safe trauma dumping on me
and then i say i charge 150 an hour uh hey it's been a while

743
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:31,090
uh but uh And I also get paid for it.

744
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:31,950
Why don't you come over tonight?

745
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:33,190
Grace and I?

746
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:33,770
Stonks.

747
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:35,470
We'd love to see you.

748
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,430
Mint as a hostage negotiator.

749
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,350
Stop by tonight.

750
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,270
Around eight or so.

751
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:44,850
It'll be great.

752
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:47,230
Oh, sorry.

753
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:47,550
I forgot.

754
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:48,510
I can skip this part.

755
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:55,310
A guy got the good ending and completed the game by being
rude and not giving a crap the entire time for a stride.

756
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:56,150
No way.

757
00:47:59,270 --> 00:47:59,670
Okay.

758
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:00,850
I can be a jerk.

759
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:04,610
I can't, well, you have to be, like, the right level of
jerk.

760
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,970
Because if you're just, like, shut up, Grace.

761
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,930
What if I don't say anything the entire time?

762
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,190
What if I, like...

763
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,130
What if I just...

764
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,930
What if I just stand there?

765
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,670
What if I don't say anything?

766
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:20,350
Let's try it.

767
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:21,090
Let's try it.

768
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:26,270
Sorry that the subtitles seem a little bit, like,
inconsistent.

769
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:27,930
But...

770
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:29,410
That's the best we can do.

771
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:31,670
Trip, when are you going to get rid of this?

772
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:33,670
Oh, gosh, I did it again.

773
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:34,990
Wah, wah!

774
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,110
I know, I know, I'll do it right now, all right?

775
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,450
You know, I've had to ask you about this separate.

776
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,150
I'll get rid of it in just a minute.

777
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,230
I'm here!

778
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:43,790
Fine, Trip, fine.

779
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,290
Open the door.

780
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:50,890
Gonzalo!

781
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:51,590
Hey!

782
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,530
I thought I heard someone out here.

783
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:54,150
Great to see.

784
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:54,950
Oh.

785
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:56,450
Uh...

786
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,530
Well, come on in.

787
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,410
Wait, what happened?

788
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:01,810
Uh...

789
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,570
It'll be just a sec while I go get Grace.

790
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,110
Trip, I'm stuck in the door!

791
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,650
Trip, trip I- oh okay, never mind.

792
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,350
I was gonna say trip, I can't come in.

793
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:12,690
I'm gonna sit down.

794
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:19,990
Put on a happy face.

795
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:23,010
I don't understand why you're always doing this to me.

796
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:24,810
Grace, we do this later.

797
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,330
Can I make a little phone call real quick?

798
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:28,990
No new messages.

799
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,130
Oh, I didn't do anything.

800
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,190

Gonzalo.

812
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:10,470
Take a look at this photo I just put up from our trip to
Italy.

813
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:12,110
Wow, we're already getting into it.

814
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,070
Gonzalo.

815
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:14,810
Come here.

816
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:15,610
I want you to look.

817
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:16,590
Gonzalo.

818
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,550
Come over here and sit on the couch with me.

819
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:19,910
Oh, they're making me choose.

820
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,270
Actually, I'm going to go sit on the couch with them.

821
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:26,130
Trip, darling, your obsession with that photo is making our
friend uncomfortable.

822
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,170
I'm very uncomfortable.

823
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:29,530
Romance.

824
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:31,670
It says romance.

825
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:33,990
I'm going to fix us some drinks.

826
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,250
Oh, and I've got these fancy new cocktail shakers.

827
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,550
No!

828
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,530
What are you going to try out?

829
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:39,330
He got it.

830
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:40,110
It's a martini sound.

831
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:41,950
I'm a real expert at fixing these.

832
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,790
At least that's what everyone tells me.

833
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:44,210
Uh-huh.

834
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:46,430
Trip, let's not go crazy with the drinks, okay?

835
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:47,170
Yeah.

836
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,110
It says italy.

837
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:50,950
Italy.

838
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,010
It's really.

839
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:54,990
It's really.

840
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,730
I'm just going to make you a martini.

841
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:58,350
No, no, Gonzalo.

842
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,530

Well, two are all chummy already that's that's good.

853

You know ever since we got married I can't help it.

854
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,640
I'm forever buying new furniture and redecorating.

855
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,440
They're just going off on their own I don't need to do
anything.

856
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,860
It's in your blood you grow up with this stuff.

857
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:35,600
Sheesh.

858
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:36,720
Here you are.

859
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,720
So I normally like redecorating, Gonzalo.

860
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,360
Now be honest with me.

861
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,020
Agree that this room just does not work.

862
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,160

00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,150
I don't want to look at you.

898
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:24,890
I'm going to comfort her.

899
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:25,630
Damn it, Trey.

900
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:26,030

Come here.

904
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,270
I don't want to kiss you on accident.

905
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:29,410
No, wait.

906
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:30,250
Please.

907
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:31,010
What?

908
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,470
Are you talking about me now?

909
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,790
I'm not talking to you.

910
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:36,790
Gonzalo.

911
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,290
I can't believe you have to see this.

912
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,070
Um, me neither.

913
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:43,670
Gonzalo.

914
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:46,570
In what you said before about marriage.

915
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:49,110
I think that tells us something about Tripp.

916
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:49,730
So true.

917
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,330
We're talking about me, are we?

918
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:52,670
Oh, he's back!

919
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:54,630
Grace, we don't have to do this.

920
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:55,530
Things are okay.

921
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,170
I can't stand the pretending anymore.

922
00:55:58,310 --> 00:55:59,510
I can't take it.

923
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:00,370
Me neither.

924
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:02,650
Me, neither.

925
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:03,890
No.

926
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,250
Grace, we can...

927
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,170
I mean, come on.

928
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:07,130
Don't make it out to be so bad.

929
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,070
She's so angry!

930
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:09,230
Ugh!

931
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,230
I'm on Grace's side right now.

932
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:12,910
What is it?

933
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,110
Is there something about me?

934
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:15,270
Um.

935
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:18,410
Look, why don't we talk about us, our relationship?

936
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:20,150
It's so annoying.

937
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:23,990
Grace, why is it that anytime I want to do something nice
for you, you resist it?

938
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:24,670
Trip.

939
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,630
Like I always have to convince you.

940
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:28,410
Gonzalo.

941
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:28,830
Oh, no.

942
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,050
I can't drink it.

943
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:30,830
Oh, I can.

944
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:34,930
I can drink all his wine.

945
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:36,550
Yeah?

946
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,710
Well, you were in the middle of a sentence.

Gonzalo, you're saying I don't communicate?

952
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:15,270
Wait, that's all.

953
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:16,610
Comisan doesn't communicate?

954
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:18,630
This is your favorite enemy?

955
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:19,170
I really do.

956
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:22,230
I try to be open and honest.

957
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:23,730
You know, Gonzalo.

958
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:24,390
Stop.

959
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:28,290
What if...

960
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,550
Communication sucks.

961
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:32,510
No, communication.

962
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:37,050
See, Grace, I feel like it's you that's not reaching out.

963
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:37,610
Ugh.

964
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,210
Ugh.

965
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:46,730
Um, you, you both are bad at talking.

966
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:48,370
Ah-ha!

967
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:49,410
Gonzalo.

968
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:51,950
You're saying I'm communicative?

969
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:55,050
You know, Tripp, whenever I really try to talk honestly
about things...

970
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:56,870
No, I said you're both bad about it.

971
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:57,210
You don't want to hear it.

972
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:57,630
What?

973
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,030
Gonzalo.

974
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:02,710
I think I'm the only one who is trying to be the most honest
here.

975
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:04,450
Duh.

976

Oh.

Hold on.

996
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:28,490
Let's keep our focus on Trip.

997
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:28,930
No.

998
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:30,050
It's your fault.

999
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:37,310
Ten years ago, freshly married and just out of college,
convinced me to go into advertising instead of art.

1000
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:37,950
What?

1001
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:39,710
If it weren't for you, I could be.

1002
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:50,310
be a real artist by now she's blaming him that was your
decision that that was your decision grace that's bullshit

1004
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:05,060
you took away from me what i wasted 10 years in this You can
still be an artist.

1005
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:06,780
What's wrong with advertising?

1006
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:08,480
Gonzalo.

1007
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:11,900
All this time, I just can't stop thinking that I should have
been painting.

1008
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,620
Why don't you just do it?

1009
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,940
That's what I'm saying.

1010
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:16,580
Just...

1011
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,080
Be a goddamn artist already.

1012
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,740
Just do it!

1013
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:19,260
Yes.

1014
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:20,740
Ah, yes.

1015
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,760
Just you saying that should really help her.

1016
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,720
Well, if I could be a painter, I...

1017
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,520
I would.

1018
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,200
Look, let's not focus on just me or you.

1019
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,560
Oh my god, I think we're actually getting somewhere here,
you guys.

1020
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,820
You just pretend to like all this stuff.

1021
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,560
Fancy cigars and fine wine.

1022
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,000
You think I'm not good enough.

1023
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,580
I never said that.

1024
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,360
I'm saying there's more to you than all this.

1025
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,060
Oh.

1026
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,960
What else is there?

1027
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:49,960
What?

1028
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:50,880
Then cigar.

1029
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,160
Thank you.

1030
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,420
That helps us.

1031
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:53,900
It does.

1032
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:59,320
Trip, I know that you like to hang out at that little sports
bar on the corner.

1033
01:00:59,660 --> 01:00:59,860
What?

1034
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,080
Wouldn't not...

1035
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:01,420
No.

1036
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,520
Why did he...

1037
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:03,520
Trip, it's all right.

1038
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,820
Oh, he moved closer.

1039
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,400
The sports bar.

1040
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,740
Oh, God.

1041
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,140

01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,380
Okay, that's it.

1047
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,760
No more of this bullshit.

1048
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,740
Gonzalo, I know what you're hinting at.

1049
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,060
About us.

1050
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:32,580
Oh, no.

1051
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:34,260
What about our lifestyle?

1052
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:35,440
What?

1053
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,020
Do you two want the truth?

1054
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,540
Give us the truth.

1055
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,560
Gonzalo, do you want to hear it?

1056
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:42,440
Yes.

1057
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:44,620
Grace?

1058
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:45,400
Yes.

1059
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,080
See, Gonzalo, I've been paying attention to what you've been
saying tonight.

1060
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:50,480
Okay.

1061
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,380
You've been really pushing me tonight.

1062
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,500
I'm a pusher.

1063
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,080
It makes me wonder if you're really my friend or not.

1064
01:01:58,580 --> 01:01:58,760
Trip?

1065
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,920
Gonzalo, quit interrupting me.

1066
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:01,460
Let me finish.

1067
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:02,800
Gonzalo, come on.

1068
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:10,540
on yes or no do you really think that saying that grace is
communicative telling me i'm not communicative telling grace

1069
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:17,760
to make art that will somehow realize something about our
marriage is all of that arguing intended to mean something

1070
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:33,580
yes right yes realize you realize your power see i'm ashamed
of my parents where is this coming from what Your parents

1071
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:34,500

1072
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,620
I love seeing them.

1073
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,660
I know, I know.

1074
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,940
But compared to yours, they're so ignorant.

1075
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,080
But they're real.

1076
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:47,140
I hate how my parents are pretending to be something.

1077
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,840
I've tried hard to be like your family.

1078
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:49,600
What?

1079
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,200

01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,560
But I feel like a phony.

1081
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,700
I feel like I can never get rid of my past.

1082
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,880
What's your past?

1083
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:57,400

I thought we were having dinner.

1120
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:12,000
I'm taking the magic eight ball.

1121
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,720

1122
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,180

1123
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:21,860

1124
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,740
Oh, thank God.

1125
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:25,040
Wait, what'd you say?

1126
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:25,440

1128
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,440
Did I win?

1129
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,260
You moved in with them.

1130
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,700
She said, bye, thanks.

1131
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,360
Yippee!

1132
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:57,540
What?

1133
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,500
It's my house now.

1134
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,280
Oh my god, this is actually like what happens to me for
real.

1135
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:08,920
I go and hunt someone and then sometimes they leave and it
becomes my house.

1136
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,700
That's really exciting.

1137
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,600
I didn't know that that could happen in the game as well.

1138
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:19,360
Hold on.

1139
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,920
Let's try another one.

1140
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,980
I think someone said, like, speak only.

1141
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:27,100
That one, we barely talked and it actually ended up working
out.

1142
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,360
How is that possible?

1143
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:33,380
Maybe they really just needed to talk things out and we were
just a good friend to listen, you know?

1144
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:35,060
You can...

1145
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,520
I want to actually...

1146
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,540
I do want to kind of romance someone.

1147
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:39,920
You know?

1148
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:48,740

Why is so like...

1154
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,100
Oh my god, I'm going to ask her if she painted that.

1155
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,560
Only MGS quotes, right?

1156
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,400
Okay, let's do that one, and then we'll romance Grace.

1157
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,000
Okay.

1158
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,580
She's going to really fall hard for Gonzalo.

1159
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,120
Some titles on.

1160
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:35,940
Okay.

1161
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,880
All right, first we'll do the Metal Gear.

1162
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:39,900
Okay.

1163
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:41,960
And then?

1164
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,160
Where are the new wine glasses?

1165
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,840
Oh my gosh, I do that.

1166
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:46,740
That should be obvious.

1167
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,860
Oh god, Tripp, don't turn this into a big production,
please.

1168
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,220

01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:57,360
I'm here.

1174
01:08:58,860 --> 01:08:59,140

redecorate.

1200
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:15,510

1201
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:16,070
Oh, wait.

1202
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:19,470
So, yeah, I just bought this painting.

But, God, you know, it looks like an amateur painted it.

01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:23,110
You painted it.

1205
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:27,350

01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:41,330
I didn't do anything.

1245

You and my parents are always planning these stupid trips I

Expensive ones at that.

1276
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:15,410
What's wrong with vacations?

1277
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:17,150
Of course, nobody thinks to ask me what I want.

1278
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:19,550
What do you want, Grace?

1279
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:20,450

You goddamn artist already.

1295
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:40,510
What are you afraid of, Grace?

1296
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:50,030
Well, this painting, well, see, all I really wanted was
something personal and beautiful and special.

1297
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:51,510
Okay, and so...

1298
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:52,650
But I just...

1299
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:56,190
No, I just get so depressed and angry when I look at it.

1300
01:17:56,430 --> 01:18:00,410
Your triangles are so personal.

1301
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:05,430
I it's it's wonderful triangles.

1302
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:05,770
Yes.

1303
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:08,690
No, look there's nothing wrong with the stupid painting.

1304
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:10,110
It makes me feel like shit.

1305
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,150
It's not stupid.

1306
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:12,350
You feel like that for no reason.

1307
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:14,690
It's not stupid.

1308
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:19,090
Even though now you're a creative director at work and even
though you redecorate so triangular.

1309
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:21,290
The truth is you're not an artist.

1310
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:22,850
I'm sorry.

1311
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:23,510
You're not.

1312
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:24,550
Gonzalo.

1313
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:27,310
Gonzalo.

1314
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:28,730
Why do you say my name?

1315
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:31,510
You're an artist.

1316
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:33,930
Gonzalo.

1317
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,410
You know, we already talked about that.

1318
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:37,390
Okay.

1319
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:39,470
Paint.

1320
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:42,410
Gonzalo.

1321
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:45,810
Can we possibly talk any more about Grace's stuff tonight?

1322
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:47,410

1326
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:50,470

1327
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:52,870
Gonzalo.

1328
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:54,150
Gonzalo.

1329
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,190
Jesus.

1330
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:56,690
Gonzalo.

1331
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:57,990
Quit it with that stuff.

1332
01:18:58,210 --> 01:18:58,370

1345
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:57,450
to what you've been saying tonight yeah you've been pushing
me tonight oh I'm pushing you on I wonder are you really my

Let me finish.

1348
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:04,250
Gonzalo, I ask you this.

1349
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:05,490
Yes or no?

1350
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:05,830
Oh.

1351
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:11,270
Do you really think that praising me, asking if we're okay,
kissing grace?

1352
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:14,510
But especially what you said about harmless flirting.

1353
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:17,270
And you don't even say yes when I ask you if you want the
truth.

1354
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:21,130
That I'm supposed to realize something about myself from all
that.

1355
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:24,170
Is what you've said tonight supposed to add up somehow to
something?

1356
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:25,450
Maybe.

1357
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:25,850
Is it?

1358
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:26,930
I just want a yes or no.

1359
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:27,970
Oh, it's okay.

1360
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:28,510
Yes.

1361
01:21:29,170 --> 01:21:29,650
Okay.

1365
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:04,590

1367
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,220
Oh, my God.

1368
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:14,980

01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:22,840
Gonzalo.

1378
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:23,340
I .E.

1379
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:23,700
Yes.

1380
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,100
It does change everything.

1381
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:26,780
No.

1382
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:27,980
Gonzalo.

1383
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:28,600
Gonzalo.

1384
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,160
Hold on.

1385
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:29,580
Yes.

1386
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,740
Where's he going?

1387
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,760
He's stomping over there.

1388
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,140
I think it's over.

1389
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:36,580
Okay.

1390
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,000
Trip, what?

1391
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:38,420
No.

1392
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:42,200
It's over, Grace.

1393
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,380
Don't you see that?

1394
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:44,640
She doesn't see anything.

1395
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,640
She's only looking at me.

1396
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,140
You just told me.

1397
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,040
I just told you something about me.

1398
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,820
I should have said a long time ago.

1399
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:51,240
What's that?

1400
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:54,600
I can't be married to an artist.

1401
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:55,900
This guy sucks so much.

1402
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,080
What do you have against art?

1403
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:58,560
Please, it's okay.

1404
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:00,820
Trip, no.

1405
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:01,660
I...

1406
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:02,580
No, Grace.

1407
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:03,980
This is about me.

1408
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,360
I see now.

1409
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:08,120
It's not about you or about our marriage.

1410
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:09,340
Me?

1411
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,720
Our marriage?

1412
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:11,200
Where'd he go?

1413
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:12,620
Hey, no, wait.

1414
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:13,460
Gonzalo.

1415
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,080
Gonzalo.

1416
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:14,460
I'm sorry.

1417
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:15,560
Thank you, though.

1418
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,640
You really helped me.

1419
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,580
He's actually leaving.

1420
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,120
Oh, get out of your trip.

1421
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,140
It's our house.

1422
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,300
It's our house now.

1423
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,020
Oh, my God.

1424
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:32,600
I should have told him that I wanted to be an artist.

1425
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:37,540
Oh my gosh, free wife with the house!

1426
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,380
Let's go!

1427
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,500
This might actually be a better ending for them.

1428
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:44,060
We're free wife with the house!

1429
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:45,340
Yippee!

1430
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:48,220

1431
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:48,740

1432
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,660

1433
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:50,180

1434
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:50,520
What?

1435
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,420
I really want an ending where she kind of falls for me
though.

1436
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:56,400
Hmm.

1437
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,280

When I saw this armoire in the store, it seemed to have such
a clean, simple look to it.

Yeah, it looks great.

1560
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:21,750
Well, actually this trip to Italy was meant to be our second
honeymoon.

1561
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:24,970
Wow Oh, was that what it was?

1562
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:25,350
Huh.

1563
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,470
I'm always the last to know.

1564
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:28,450
Why is it like?

1565
01:32:28,530 --> 01:32:30,610
Also, we have music this time and everything.

1566
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:31,350
Time together.

1567
01:32:31,950 --> 01:32:32,790
It's interesting.

1568
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:35,510
In a word, this says...

1569
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:38,670
Grace stayed behind in the hotel room when I was out taking
this picture.

1570
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:40,210
Romance.

1571
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:42,430
Right.

1572
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:43,450
Love.

1573
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:44,310
Romance.

1574
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:46,650
Oh, but the last time I said love, you kicked me out.

1575
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:48,250
In our marriage, that's just a code word for manipulation.

1576
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:55,790
Grace, it's been such a long time since we had a chance to
plan that trip without even asking me if I wanted to go.

1577
01:32:56,430 --> 01:32:57,750
I was curious what he'd say.

1578
01:32:58,530 --> 01:33:05,630
that's not the first time he's done that and you knew i
planned to attend my friend's art show that weekend what a

Stop sabotaging us.

1585
01:33:59,970 --> 01:34:00,290
Gonzalo.

1586
01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:01,630
Yes or no?

1587
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:08,590
Do you think it's wrong for one person in a marriage to
listen too much to the other?

1588
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:10,770
What?

1589
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:15,890
To trust your husband or wife too much, to rely on them too
much.

1590
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:17,330
Is that wrong?

1591
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:18,450
Yes or no?

1592
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:18,810
Okay.

1593
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:19,930
You guys are saying yes.

1594
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:20,510
Yes.

1595
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:21,970
What?

1596
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:24,790
You guys said yes.

1597
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:25,110
Oh.

01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:26,990
Yeah.

1600
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:28,430
Okay.

1601
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:31,590
Oh, I keep trying to help you.

1602
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:32,810
Grace, could you reject me?

1603
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:34,210
You cut me off.

1604
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:35,510
You cut me out of your life.

1605
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:37,050
God damn it.

1606
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:38,130
His cake.

1607
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:40,390
When it was, when he was walking away.

1608
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:41,670
Did you guys see him?

1609
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:43,250
I can't stand you.

1610
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:44,850
God damn it.

1611
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:48,150
What should I say?

1612
01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:49,890
What should I do to, I'll comfort her?

1613

01:34:54,210 --> 01:34:55,990
I wasn't talking about you.

1617
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:57,070
Gonzalo.

01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:46,400
Yeah.

1717
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:47,140
Oh, all right, good.

1718
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:50,420
I just wanted to make sure you hadn't forgotten that.

1719
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:53,060
Whoa, I just realized something.

1720
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,300
When's the last time you were...

1721
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:56,620
Oh, tonight's a special night.

1722
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:58,300
Oh.

1723
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:00,080
Yeah, tonight is special.

1724
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:00,700
Intimate?

1725
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:01,480
Remember?

1726
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:06,540
Uh, well, remember how you introduced us almost exactly 10
years ago?

1727
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:07,500
Don't ignore me!

1728
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:08,600
Yes.

1729
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:13,820
We really want to thank you for years and years of pain.

1730
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:16,020
Sexy time.

1731
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:21,900
Lisa, flirting with me will only make it harder to let you
leave tonight.

1732
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:25,520
Don't get carried away, Tripp.

1733
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,060
She's just telling you what you want to hear.

1734
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:28,020

Wait, wait.

1744
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:31,000
What's wrong, Tripp?

1745
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:33,660
Tripp, it's okay if we disagree in front of our friend.

1746
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:34,620
We're not disagreeing.

1747
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:35,380
No, no.

1748
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:36,860
Comfort.

1749
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:39,160
Oh, uh, you're hugging me.

1750
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,300
Lisa, careful.

1751
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:42,680
Too much affection can go to Tripp's head.

1752
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:43,620
Right.

1753
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:45,720
It's okay, it's okay.

1754
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:46,100
Oh.

1755
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:49,200

aggressive.

1760
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:25,540
You have to look at this room and admit it looks terrible.

1761
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:26,300
Terrible.

1762
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:27,220
I mean, look, or...

1763
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:28,400
No, no, no, no.

1764
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:31,120
See, Grace loves expensive furniture.

1765
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:36,780
She grew up in this really nice house with really nice
couches and fancy dishes.

1766
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:39,140
And she can't live without this stuff.

1767
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:40,600
She's not like other girls.

1768
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:41,980
She doesn't want to wear pearls.

1769
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:47,260
You know, at work I waste all day designing ads for
apartments with perfect views like this.

1770
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,560
And then it makes me think I want to design it into my
apartment.

1771
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:52,580
This view makes me feel like a million.

1772
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,480
Oh my gosh, you know, she wants to wear paper clips.

1773
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:55,580
Damn it, I'm wrong.

1774
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:58,940
I simply want a view of trees and green.

1775
01:45:59,280 --> 01:45:59,720
Trees?

1776
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:00,280
What?

1777
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:00,880
Trees?

1778
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,880
Trees are disgusting.

1779
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:10,500
Ah, what a nice surprise and honest answer.

1780
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:11,260
Lisa.

1781
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:14,020
Wait, Grace, I don't know where you're getting this.

1782
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:15,120
Wait, that's what you said.

1783
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,460
You, you, you, you, you.

1784
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,860
I could have painted that painting on the wall instead of
buying it.

1785
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:28,100
yeah we've seen how your artist friends live as if you could
survive that kind of lifestyle give me a break give me give

1789
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:53,500
That's the last one I'll do.

1790
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:54,580
Or else they'll kick me out.

1791
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:55,880
So, drinks.

1792
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:56,600
Drinks!

1793
01:46:56,600 --> 01:47:00,820
Chip's favorite pastime is to get the blood alcohol content
of his guests higher than his golf score.

1794
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:03,920
Why don't I make us one of my new drink inventions?

1795
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:05,900
I call it Grace's Inner Soul.

1796
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:09,120
It's a mixture of chardonnay, bitters, and lots of ice.

1797
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:10,140
I'd love that.

1798
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:10,800
Ah.

1799
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:14,400
Lisa, you have deliciously wicked taste.

1800
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:15,120
Oh, yes.

1801
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:15,660
It's a secret.

1802
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:17,820
Chip doesn't even like the taste of alcohol.

1803
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:18,380
What?

1804
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:20,000

01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:05,420
The real truth is, Tripp, you flirt with everybody.

1832
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:07,860
The clients at work, our friends, everybody.

1833
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:08,960
You can't help yourself.

1834
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:12,000
You're always looking around our entire marriage.

1835
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:13,140
God damn it.

1836
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:14,200

To listen to some relaxing ASMR after this or something.

1845
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:57,000
If it weren't for you, I could be a real artist by now.

1846
01:49:58,620 --> 01:50:00,500
Your art sucks.

1847
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:04,120
This painting, well...

1848
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:06,500
See, all I really wanted was something personal.

1849
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:07,360
It's bad.

1850
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:08,220
It's bad.

1851
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,680
Look, there's nothing wrong with the stupid painting.

1852
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:11,400
I guess there is.

1853
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:12,500
It makes me feel like shit.

1854
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:13,820
It's bad.

1855
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:15,560

You know what?

1861
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:54,540
I think you should leave.

1862
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:58,660
You'll be fine.

1863
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:00,140
You should just go.

1864
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:00,920
Why?

1865
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:02,320

1866
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:04,840
What?

1867
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:14,400
What happened?

1868
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:20,260
I was too freaky.

1869
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:28,440
Did you ever see the AR room this game was made for?

1870
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:32,100
It's just a guy with prototype VR goggles and a giant
backpack on.

1871
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:34,480
I've never seen it.

1872
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:36,060
Trip rejected me.

1873
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:38,140
But I didn't...

1874
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:40,420
But I didn't do anything!

1875
01:51:43,420 --> 01:51:44,360
Another one.

1876
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,860
What do you mean another one?

1877
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:47,820
Thank you.

1878
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:51,380
Thank you for the gift that you guys thank you.

Dang.

1881
01:51:56,820 --> 01:51:58,100
I didn't know he was a bartender.

1882
01:51:58,640 --> 01:51:59,260
M-M-M.

1883
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:00,360

If this is...

2018
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:54,240
If this is this area, then that means like there's arcade
and then there's like super potato and then this would be...

2019
02:04:54,240 --> 02:04:57,860
It said Tsukimo, but maybe it's supposed to be the
Kotobukiya.

2020
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:01,000
If it's this area.

2021
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:04,820
Wow!

2022
02:05:10,050 --> 02:05:10,610
Hey, that's me.

2023
02:05:11,810 --> 02:05:15,030
Oh, why is she blocked out?

2024
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:20,850
Do the characters get introduced?

2025
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:27,990
Oh my gosh, the Momo-i- the Momo-i doke!

2026
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:32,950
Oh, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's so fast.

2030
02:05:47,530 --> 02:05:48,410
So that's the word.

2031
02:05:50,030 --> 02:05:51,970
It's a legendary clock in Akiba.

2032
02:05:52,190 --> 02:06:00,490
It's right outside the station towards the Radio Kaikan, the
Radio Kaikan building side.

2033
02:06:01,790 --> 02:06:02,710
Legendary clock.

2034
02:06:03,670 --> 02:06:05,470
So it's really cool that they included it.

2035
02:06:07,970 --> 02:06:09,310
This is such a jam.

2036
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:10,510
Wait, hold on.

2037
02:06:10,750 --> 02:06:14,930
I know I keep stopping and going through, but I want to see
what they include.

2038
02:06:16,350 --> 02:06:17,510
Of course, there's a train.

2039
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:24,880
Which one is this supposed to be?

2040
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:27,980
I guess it's just supposed to be one of the...

2041
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:28,600
Wait, hmm?

2042
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:30,780
Hmm.

2043
02:06:31,100 --> 02:06:32,020
I guess it's maybe...

2044
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:34,740
What building is this supposed to be?

2045
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:37,620
Actual electronic shop.

2046
02:06:38,440 --> 02:06:40,180
Yeah, they still exist.

2047
02:06:40,780 --> 02:06:42,060
They still exist in Akiva.

2048
02:06:44,140 --> 02:06:45,280
Oh no, Den is huge.

2049
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:50,320
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na.

2050
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:04,580
They're so cute, I love their outfits so much.

2051
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:07,960
Wow.

2052
02:07:15,570 --> 02:07:18,790
Are they actually fighting so many people?

2053
02:07:23,270 --> 02:07:24,150
Oh, cute!

2054
02:07:26,190 --> 02:07:30,030
The confetti, I'm surprised the confetti doesn't ruin the
bit right.

2055
02:07:39,870 --> 02:07:42,050
Why is this a bob, though?

2056
02:07:44,490 --> 02:07:52,490
But no, this area, this almost looks like, this actually
looks like Yodobashi.

2057
02:07:55,270 --> 02:07:59,450
It looks like, I don't know if it is or not though, like
Yodobashi camera.

2058
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:02,050
Oh, so cute.

2059
02:08:03,170 --> 02:08:04,150
Such a bob.

2060
02:08:06,210 --> 02:08:08,690
I could be getting this area wrong, right?

2061
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:11,890
Because it's, if it's, it's chemo, I don't know.

2062
02:08:13,890 --> 02:08:16,030
If it's the melon books...

2063
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:20,290
Hmm, but it depends on if this is Chuo Dori or not, but
because it...

2064
02:08:20,850 --> 02:08:22,370
Because if it's the...

2065
02:08:23,630 --> 02:08:26,010
Sorry, I'm getting all confused now.

2066
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:31,070
I'm getting all confused now.

2067
02:08:31,410 --> 02:08:32,310
It's a Kumo.

2068
02:08:32,470 --> 02:08:37,750
Yeah, it's a Kumo, but the area I'm thinking of... See,
there's Akibao right there.

2069
02:08:38,210 --> 02:08:39,790
Oh, sorry, Okibao.

2070
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:45,110
Akibao.

2071
02:08:49,590 --> 02:08:51,910
Quick, take us to Google Street View.

2072
02:08:53,430 --> 02:08:54,550
You're so right.

2073
02:08:57,150 --> 02:08:57,830
Okibao.

2074
02:08:58,270 --> 02:08:58,830
It's so funny.

2075
02:08:59,850 --> 02:09:00,190
Akibao?

2076
02:09:00,350 --> 02:09:02,010
There's several in Akiba though.

2077
02:09:03,710 --> 02:09:07,350
Those are also like popular electronic stores in Akiba.

2078
02:09:08,770 --> 02:09:09,750
Geogesser Mint.

2079
02:09:09,990 --> 02:09:12,170
I'm no, I'm no, what's that guy's name?

2080
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:24,450
It's funny because besides the Suika books, the opening
shows like mostly, it doesn't show like any of the anime

2081
02:09:24,450 --> 02:09:25,870
like stuff.

2082
02:09:26,230 --> 02:09:32,350
It mostly focuses on like, you know, you can see like the
DVD like stores that you can buy and sell stuff.

2083
02:09:32,530 --> 02:09:35,970
And then there's the computer Semmon store.

2084
02:09:38,410 --> 02:09:42,130
It doesn't focus on all the anime stuff there is around in
the area too.

2085
02:09:45,570 --> 02:09:54,110
Thanks for the fun stream, Mint, I need to sleep now, good
night, things are hanging out, thank you, I think this might

2086
02:09:54,110 --> 02:10:01,750
be an alley parallel to the main road, I think so too, but
that's why I'm, that's why my brain is like, where are we,

2087
02:10:02,050 --> 02:10:14,510
because, okay, this looks like the building that has, well,
maybe not, it looks like the building that has, has the main

2088
02:10:14,510 --> 02:10:25,970
dream in it which would make sense if this were if this were
the Kinokunia sorry Kotobukiya and then if this were the

2089
02:10:25,970 --> 02:10:34,090
melon books because the melon but the melon books you have
to go you you have to you either go through the what's the

2090
02:10:34,090 --> 02:10:41,910
word the the the the arcade or you go around to the front
but this looks like Chua Dori over here so I don't know I

2091
02:10:41,910 --> 02:10:49,450
don't know oh my gosh I'm a fake akiba fan this anime takes
place in the 90s oh

2092
02:10:53,120 --> 02:11:13,330
90s the night oh there was the windows yeah that's right
where'd it go they did have the windows oh windmill windmill

2093
02:11:13,330 --> 02:11:18,810
95 are there even maid cafes back then

2094
02:11:22,970 --> 02:11:25,510
Mmm, mysterious, old-timey Akiba.

2095
02:11:27,130 --> 02:11:33,730
Sometimes I, there's like, sometimes I'll go through, like,
sites that have, like, old shops and stuff that were in

2096
02:11:33,730 --> 02:11:34,150
Akiba.

2097
02:11:34,530 --> 02:11:35,750
I just like to read about them.

2098
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:43,550
During the Maid Wars.

2099
02:11:44,250 --> 02:11:47,590
That's why there's no Maids, because they're still at war.

2100
02:11:49,370 --> 02:11:50,410
I get it.

2101
02:11:52,290 --> 02:11:52,630
now.

2102
02:11:52,890 --> 02:11:53,650
I understand now.

2103
02:11:58,530 --> 02:11:59,570
That was fun.

2104
02:12:00,250 --> 02:12:00,790
That was silly.

2105
02:12:02,410 --> 02:12:08,350
I'm going to move over here.

2106
02:12:10,370 --> 02:12:10,990
Hello.

2107
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:17,050
And I'm gonna I'm gonna one second.

2108
02:12:18,670 --> 02:12:20,070
I'm gonna put on some BGM.

2109
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:24,070
And I'm, oh, let me exit out of the facade game too.

2110
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:24,730
Exit.

2111
02:12:25,290 --> 02:12:25,650
Exit.

2112
02:12:25,990 --> 02:12:25,990
Okay.

2113
02:12:27,250 --> 02:12:36,890
And BGM, BGM, BGM, BGM, BGM, BGM, BGM, BGM, BGM, BGM, BGM,
BGM, BGM.

2114
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:37,950
Where was my music?

2115
02:12:39,490 --> 02:12:40,630
Why can't I ever find it?

2116
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:55,680
There we go.

2117
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,640
Bada-dada-dada-dada-dum-dum-dum.

2118
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:07,280
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

2119
02:13:07,980 --> 02:13:08,300
Smash boo!

2120
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:14,940
I want melon bread now.

2121
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:17,100
No, the song is called Lemon Cake.

2122
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:19,380
You're so close.

2123
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:22,480
You're so close.

2124
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:25,720
I still haven't even...

2125
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:29,920
I'm still using all the same BGM I used to use in the past.

2126
02:13:30,580 --> 02:13:31,700
When did I even save this?

2127
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:35,600
July...

2128
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:36,780
July...

2129
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:38,120
Wait, this doesn't make any sense.

2130
02:13:39,440 --> 02:13:40,580
It says created...

2131
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:43,480
August 13th, 2020.

2132
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:48,420
But then it says modified July 18th, 2020.

2133
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:53,520
How does that make any sense?

2134
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:56,280
What?

2135
02:13:56,680 --> 02:13:58,660
How was it created in August?

2136
02:14:02,810 --> 02:14:06,490
Small brain Thank you for the 50 Thank you

2137
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:25,400

02:14:39,610 --> 02:14:40,810
You guys next week Emory and...

2142
02:14:40,810 --> 02:14:41,410
Can I say that?

2143
02:14:41,510 --> 02:14:42,910
Can I say that we're gonna collab next week?

2144
02:14:44,810 --> 02:14:46,490
Well, I said it.

2145
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:49,950
Gonna collab with Emory next week.

2146
02:14:51,130 --> 02:14:53,770
When I was in Japan, Emory and I hung out a couple times.

2147
02:14:55,730 --> 02:14:56,050
Yippee!

2148
02:14:56,970 --> 02:15:04,810
We went shopping and um, we got our hair done together and
it was so fun.

2149
02:15:07,030 --> 02:15:07,570
Spoilers.

2150
02:15:09,130 --> 02:15:09,670
Spoilers.

2151
02:15:09,810 --> 02:15:12,490
I don't know what I'm at all doing next week, though.

2152
02:15:13,410 --> 02:15:13,970
What are we streaming?

2153
02:15:14,170 --> 02:15:16,870
I think we're doing a collab with a lethal company.

2154
02:15:19,470 --> 02:15:22,010
And I'm doing mods for the first time ever.

2155
02:15:22,530 --> 02:15:26,390
The one mod that I've always wanted to do was the Skid
Walker mod.

2156
02:15:26,810 --> 02:15:28,090
Where it copies your voices?

2157
02:15:28,670 --> 02:15:29,370
Oh my gosh.

2158
02:15:29,950 --> 02:15:31,150
I'm kind of scared.

2159
02:15:34,110 --> 02:15:35,630
Fukuoka, thanks for the vibe, Kim did!

2160
02:15:36,970 --> 02:15:39,190
Thank you guys, everybody joining, everybody gifting.

2161
02:15:39,910 --> 02:15:40,730
Thank you so much.

2162
02:15:40,950 --> 02:15:41,770
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2163
02:15:42,750 --> 02:15:52,550
Yeah, there's like a skinwalker mod that will like copy your
voice and then like so you'll be, you know, walking through

2164
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:56,310
the mines, swinging your pickaxe side to side, side to side.

2165
02:15:56,650 --> 02:15:59,190
And then you'll hear your friend and you'll be like, oh hi!

2166
02:15:59,750 --> 02:16:01,130
But it wasn't your friend, it was...

2167
02:16:01,150 --> 02:16:03,210
It's actually a monster.

2168
02:16:05,830 --> 02:16:07,850
It's genuinely so confusing.

2169
02:16:09,610 --> 02:16:11,210
The Goku mod!

2170
02:16:13,170 --> 02:16:14,190
What's that?

2171
02:16:15,230 --> 02:16:17,750
What's the Goku mod?

2172
02:16:19,390 --> 02:16:23,330
Is it just the two of you playing Lethal?

2173
02:16:23,630 --> 02:16:25,070
No, we have some other people.

2174
02:16:28,330 --> 02:16:28,710
Yes.

2175
02:16:29,690 --> 02:16:30,750
We have some other people.

2176
02:16:31,550 --> 02:16:38,210
but I've never collabed with them before so I'm a little
nervous

2177
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:42,790
yeah yeah

2178
02:16:46,270 --> 02:16:47,830
who is he?

2179
02:16:48,330 --> 02:16:50,930
I'm not gonna say what about Mataro?

2180
02:16:51,290 --> 02:17:02,190
I do want to play games with Mataro I don't know maybe
because I talk to her so much thank you so much maybe

2181
02:17:02,190 --> 02:17:10,270
because I talk with her so much because of the podcast like
you know maybe we're okay no i'm just kidding i still do

2182
02:17:10,270 --> 02:17:26,370
want to play games with her but i'm trying to um ease myself
in to collapse and stuff like that so i don't know just

2183
02:17:26,370 --> 02:17:35,130
because you know i don't want to come in swinging when um i
just got back Yeah, yeah.

2184
02:17:35,270 --> 02:17:36,010
Take your time.

2185
02:17:36,210 --> 02:17:36,810
Thank you.

2186
02:17:37,430 --> 02:17:37,790
Thank you.

2187
02:17:37,950 --> 02:17:38,230
Thank you.

2188
02:17:38,570 --> 02:17:39,970
Maybe after the pod season.

2189
02:17:40,430 --> 02:17:43,170
I also, you know, I don't want people to get sick of us.

2190
02:17:43,250 --> 02:17:46,190
Like, if we're always on the pod and we're always talking.

2191
02:17:46,590 --> 02:17:52,170
And, um, we're, like, you know, I don't want it to be like,
oh, you guys are collabing too.

2192
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:54,570
Oh my gosh, I've seen way too much of a Minta Matara.

2193
02:17:55,310 --> 02:17:55,670
Please.

2194
02:17:57,390 --> 02:18:02,590
Well, obviously we will be streaming, though, when I go and
visit her and she plays Metal Gear.

2195
02:18:03,070 --> 02:18:04,130
So, hmm.

2196
02:18:07,270 --> 02:18:10,040
So, there's that to look forward to.

2197
02:18:11,370 --> 02:18:13,070
Matara overdose.

2198
02:18:15,270 --> 02:18:16,810
Hakuna Matara.

2199
02:18:17,830 --> 02:18:19,270
Metal Gear.

2200
02:18:23,170 --> 02:18:23,630
Nah.

2201
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:29,650
So, I don't know exactly how that's gonna work, though.

2202
02:18:31,250 --> 02:18:33,610
Are we gonna watch BBC Wildlife videos?

2203
02:18:33,610 --> 02:18:44,050
stop mine my trauma I can't believe these people are friends
I hate that notorious BSJ thank you for that happy gift

2204
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:53,790
thank you also looking at the some of these are probably
older stream labs but Akiba maid war watch along the show

2205
02:18:53,790 --> 02:19:01,990
felt like watching a yakuza show but with maids instead is
there like is there like any mystery to it or is it like

2206
02:19:02,790 --> 02:19:10,610
just kind of It's not violent, but I don't know how to say.

2207
02:19:13,470 --> 02:19:14,430
Spy animals.

2208
02:19:16,090 --> 02:19:17,490
No spy animals.

2209
02:19:19,210 --> 02:19:20,130
A little mystery.

2210
02:19:20,810 --> 02:19:21,690
Plenty of violence.

2211
02:19:23,850 --> 02:19:24,750
It's quite surreal.

2212
02:19:25,070 --> 02:19:25,370
Meep!

2213
02:19:25,410 --> 02:19:26,550

Oh yeah, the blurred face mystery girl.

2216
02:19:31,390 --> 02:19:37,610
Well, I wasn't, you know how like in some shows, um they'll
blur people out or they'll like scratch people out until

2217
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:45,330
they're introduced in the show i wasn't sure if that was the
case um i like shows like that though where they change the

2218
02:19:45,330 --> 02:19:51,270
opening they'll reveal more things in the opening as more
stuff is revealed in the show is so cool

2219
02:19:56,110 --> 02:20:03,670
naigif low-key emotion wrecking

2220
02:20:08,360 --> 02:20:08,740
Huh?

2221
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:11,380
Huh?

2222
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:13,240
Azura!

2223
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:15,600
Thank you for the 50 gift and thank you!

2224
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:17,980
Gakogurashi was great for that.

2225
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:21,900
Oh my gosh, I think of Gakogurashi.

2226
02:20:24,040 --> 02:20:26,960
Every time when I think of like that concept.

2227
02:20:34,120 --> 02:20:35,280
Gift shower.

2228
02:20:35,580 --> 02:20:36,060
I know.

2229
02:20:38,360 --> 02:20:41,360
Why are you guys so nice to me?

2230
02:20:47,080 --> 02:20:47,460
Whoa.

2231
02:20:49,240 --> 02:20:50,360
What's going on?

2232
02:20:56,440 --> 02:20:58,330
Did you get Rem on Nike?

2233
02:20:58,750 --> 02:20:59,110
You know what?

2234
02:20:59,110 --> 02:21:00,570
I'm not a huge Nike player.

2235
02:21:01,850 --> 02:21:02,370
I'm haunted.

2236
02:21:02,550 --> 02:21:03,530
I'm glitching.

2237
02:21:07,230 --> 02:21:09,050
I'm not a big Nike player.

2238
02:21:09,730 --> 02:21:17,890
uh i played a little bit um how's fujisan doing today let's
check fujisan update

2239
02:21:21,850 --> 02:21:30,130
you cannot see fujisan it's cloudy that's typically how it
is that's one of the reasons or one of one of the few

2240
02:21:30,130 --> 02:21:36,870
reasons i don't like summer it's because it's always cloudy
maria why are you

2241
02:21:41,770 --> 02:21:42,050
Thank you!

2242
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:47,110
Thank you so much, I hope you've been enjoying Metal Gear.

2243
02:21:50,330 --> 02:21:54,210
V2ers from Japan play a lot of old Ace Combat lately.

2244
02:21:58,450 --> 02:22:00,250
War need to play in EM.

2245
02:22:04,030 --> 02:22:04,170
Yeah.

2246
02:22:06,130 --> 02:22:09,490
Nike is solid, but once we get far enough, it gets so
tedious.

2247
02:22:10,190 --> 02:22:11,530
I don't know, I...

2248
02:22:13,870 --> 02:22:22,690
I really love, I don't, I'm the type that can, that focuses
mostly on one gotcha game at a time.

2249
02:22:23,370 --> 02:22:28,010
So me, me and Blue Archive, we are tight.

2250
02:22:28,250 --> 02:22:30,090
We are, we are so tight.

2251
02:22:30,930 --> 02:22:38,530
I don't see myself giving up Blue Archive and hopefully I
don't see it disappearing from the English side anytime

2252
02:22:38,530 --> 02:22:39,430
soon.

2253
02:22:41,770 --> 02:22:43,750
A lot of YouTubers have been playing Metal Gear so all
lately.

2254
02:22:44,050 --> 02:22:44,370
I know.

2255
02:22:45,250 --> 02:22:46,090
So awesome.

2256
02:22:46,910 --> 02:22:48,010
I wonder why.

2257
02:22:51,130 --> 02:22:53,070
More people should play Metal Gear though.

2258
02:22:53,690 --> 02:22:57,590
More people should play Metal Gear and know why it's so
great.

2259
02:22:59,270 --> 02:23:00,410
I like Asana and Karin.

2260
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:03,670
Unlike Pre-Kanay.

2261
02:23:04,070 --> 02:23:18,710
I mean, I mean, I mean, the master collection I think helps
a ton with people being able to play before obviously you

2262
02:23:18,710 --> 02:23:27,650
had to jump through a little bit of hoops to either like you
know you could play the GOG metal gear solid but with all

2263
02:23:27,650 --> 02:23:43,740
the issues it has and then and then if you wanted to play it
you'd have to like get like a PS3 and all this stuff and

2264
02:23:43,740 --> 02:23:51,260
then also you have to all there was was the HD collection
and yeah so I get it I get why more people are playing it

2265
02:23:51,260 --> 02:24:04,520
now well the techniques are the vibe captain thank you ducky
uh-oh but yeah so do you have any ways on how to get into

2266

apothecary diaries because because I've seen a lot about it

2280
02:26:42,570 --> 02:26:48,570
but I don't know anything about it but From what I saw, I
thought it was like a Shojo or something.

2281
02:26:49,170 --> 02:26:49,770
It's a mystery!

2282
02:26:50,530 --> 02:26:51,190
Romance.

2283
02:26:51,950 --> 02:26:53,010
It's like a mystery.

2284
02:26:53,790 --> 02:26:54,990
Kyler, thanks for the 10 Gifts.

2285
02:26:55,530 --> 02:26:56,130
Thank you.

2286
02:26:58,410 --> 02:26:59,130
It's so...

2287
02:26:59,130 --> 02:27:01,450
It's anime breaking bad?

2288
02:27:03,310 --> 02:27:04,030
What?

2289
02:27:06,750 --> 02:27:08,050
Historical mystery.

2290
02:27:08,450 --> 02:27:11,430
Romance, mystery, and romance.

2291
02:27:11,630 --> 02:27:13,490
I mean...

2292
02:27:15,450 --> 02:27:16,950
It's like a mystery.

2293
02:27:17,850 --> 02:27:19,350
Is it a mystery or like a mystery?

2294
02:27:20,550 --> 02:27:23,070
This looks like MTS 5 is my first game, though.

2295
02:27:23,450 --> 02:27:24,890
Let's me be really confused.

2296
02:27:27,050 --> 02:27:28,310
Yeah, I can believe that.

2297
02:27:29,010 --> 02:27:29,570
Hey, I'm Dragon.

2298
02:27:29,670 --> 02:27:30,690
Thank you for the toy, honey.

2299
02:27:31,110 --> 02:27:31,710
Thank you.

2300
02:27:31,850 --> 02:27:33,670
Oh my gosh, you guys are...

2301
02:27:33,670 --> 02:27:35,930
No wonder... No wonder we hit the...

2302
02:27:35,930 --> 02:27:39,050
No wonder we hit the amount...

2303
02:27:39,050 --> 02:27:41,150
The max amount of...

2304
02:27:41,150 --> 02:27:42,710
Of, uh...

2305
02:27:42,710 --> 02:27:43,330
Oh my god.

2306
02:27:46,110 --> 02:27:46,610
Wait...

2307
02:27:46,610 --> 02:27:47,470
Oh my god.

2308
02:27:48,490 --> 02:27:50,470
You guys, I think we have enough members, for real.

2309
02:27:54,470 --> 02:27:56,610
I'm concerned about the Minecraft server.

2310
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:01,890
I don't think I can make a server this big.

2311
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:06,540
I don't...

2312
02:28:11,390 --> 02:28:14,350
I've actually never made a server before, so I'm going to...

2313
02:28:16,050 --> 02:28:17,070
Do my best.

2314
02:28:17,350 --> 02:28:18,790
Pokerawa thinks you're the vibe gifted.

2315
02:28:18,870 --> 02:28:19,910
Wait, I said stop.

2316
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:32,810
You probably can't.

2317
02:28:36,310 --> 02:28:38,930
Oh my god, you guys stop playing.

2318
02:28:43,290 --> 02:28:44,650
What does...

2319
02:28:45,390 --> 02:28:46,070
Like...

2320
02:28:46,070 --> 02:28:51,450
Don't people do Minecraft servers for, like, their
Patreon...

2321
02:28:52,210 --> 02:29:04,950
things and stuff poopy thank you but how do they how do they
do it though oh my gosh thank you for that katsuba thank you

2322
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:12,590
oh close the first of all it does thank you for the 50s nick
thank you for the five fion thank you for the 10 thank you

2323
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:18,010
guys did you thank you for the five fox play thank you for
the five billy joe thank you for the 10.

2324
02:29:22,110 --> 02:29:23,550
But how to...

2325
02:29:23,550 --> 02:29:25,670
Those are usually not $2 subs, though.

2326
02:29:27,070 --> 02:29:28,270
Am I...

2327
02:29:28,270 --> 02:29:29,810
Did I make a mistake?

2328
02:29:34,170 --> 02:29:36,070
Oh, Lepanto fan, thank you for the fan thing!

2329
02:29:36,990 --> 02:29:39,930
An epic stuff, really suck it in my face.

2330
02:29:41,550 --> 02:29:43,130
What do I do then?

2331
02:29:43,210 --> 02:29:44,010
What do I do?

2332
02:29:45,890 --> 02:29:47,790
Oh, if I...

2333
02:29:47,790 --> 02:29:49,950
I can't change the price because...

2334
02:29:51,530 --> 02:30:01,510
because okay this is the issue if I change the price it
kicks everyone out and if I if I make a higher tier I think

2335
02:30:01,510 --> 02:30:13,450
if you if people gift members it will default to that tier
so like I don't want it to be more expensive like I know

2336
02:30:13,450 --> 02:30:16,790
that people you know vtuber fans probably have so many

2337
02:30:19,950 --> 02:30:26,370
like the last person you think about you know like
especially if the like especially if there's some people who

2338
02:30:26,370 --> 02:30:35,110
are like oh i'm also a patreon member then you do definitely

Thank you guys so much.

2344
02:31:29,430 --> 02:31:37,850
This is why I didn't want to open on stream because I knew
it would just be a free for all.

2345
02:31:38,710 --> 02:31:40,170
I knew it would be chaos.

2346
02:31:40,790 --> 02:31:43,230
I didn't want to just be sitting here being like, thank you.

2347

02:32:26,610 --> 02:32:27,090
Stop.

2356
02:32:28,390 --> 02:32:30,830
I will be sad if your server is not called Outer Heaven.

2357
02:32:32,190 --> 02:32:35,150
Especially since you yourself are out of heaven,
technically.

2358
02:32:37,370 --> 02:32:42,110
I will take that consideration, that naming consideration,
to heart.

2359
02:32:42,690 --> 02:32:43,110
Yes.

2360
02:32:44,010 --> 02:32:44,530
Yes.

2361
02:32:45,010 --> 02:32:45,650
Yes.

2362
02:32:47,870 --> 02:32:49,030
I'm excited though.

2363
02:32:49,870 --> 02:32:59,030
Actually, I have next week, if I can get the everything kind
of set up, I have a stream planned for starting the server

2364
02:32:59,030 --> 02:33:05,050
at least and like kind of building a little bit of stuff so
that we can...

2365
02:33:06,810 --> 02:33:08,170
I'm scared though.

2366
02:33:08,250 --> 02:33:09,610
I'm really scared.

2367
02:33:11,330 --> 02:33:12,130
I don't know.

2368
02:33:12,470 --> 02:33:14,590
Maybe I need to rethink this though.

2369
02:33:16,270 --> 02:33:17,850
Because I can't just be like...

2370
02:33:17,870 --> 02:33:26,190
like alright first come first serve gets into the Minecraft
server you know I don't know well well also people can have

2371
02:33:26,190 --> 02:33:36,380
access but that doesn't mean everybody will be on at the
same time right so maybe it's actually okay there can be a

2372
02:33:36,380 --> 02:33:53,080
max limit but everyone has access not everyone not the limit
won't be the limit the limit does not exist I recently on

2373
02:33:53,080 --> 02:34:01,640
the plane They had Did you guys know that they made A Mean
Girls movie Well they had a Mean Girls musical And then they

2374
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:04,240
made Made the Mean Girls movie musical

2375
02:34:07,860 --> 02:34:16,740
I don't know I don't think I liked it very much I don't
think I liked it very much The server will lag The server

2376
02:34:16,740 --> 02:34:23,980
will lag So bad Ooh I also missed an opportunity not calling
Heaven Zanzibar.

2377
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:33,860
Yes, let me travel back in time to before I played Metal
Gear and say that I'm going to Zanzibar instead.

2378
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:38,820
And everyone will be like, what?

2379
02:34:40,260 --> 02:34:42,000
That makes no sense.

2380
02:34:44,220 --> 02:34:45,560
Regina George is so pretty.

2381
02:34:46,080 --> 02:34:47,040
She is very pretty.

2382
02:34:47,720 --> 02:34:49,800
I don't know, I just didn't like the...

2383
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:53,260
I felt the songs were, like, kind of lacking.

2384
02:34:53,800 --> 02:34:56,140
I'd never seen the musical before, by the way, so.

2385
02:34:56,740 --> 02:35:00,640
But I felt like the songs were lacking in, like, power,
except for Regina, usually.

2386
02:35:00,860 --> 02:35:08,180
But I don't, it was also, it felt, like, uncomfortable
sometimes with some of the changes that they made.

2387
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:09,260
I was like, huh?

2388
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:10,900
I don't get it.

2389
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:12,380
Create a time paradox.

2390
02:35:15,560 --> 02:35:16,360
Ghost Babel.

2391
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:18,400
I'm still trying to find a copy of Ghost Babel.

2392
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:28,680
Have you ever played the Ace Combat 7 special mission DLC?

2393
02:35:28,860 --> 02:35:29,860
I have not played it yet.

2394
02:35:31,820 --> 02:35:32,630
Not yet, not yet.

2395
02:35:36,860 --> 02:35:37,860
Epy mint.

2396
02:35:38,940 --> 02:35:39,380
I'm Epy.

2397
02:35:40,640 --> 02:35:41,840
Slepy, slepy.

2398
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:52,220
You'll probably never see more than 50% members logged into
the Minecraft server at once.

2399
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:56,760
Yeah, but like, I worry if I stream it.

2400
02:35:58,380 --> 02:35:59,400
Like, what if people...

2401
02:35:59,400 --> 02:36:03,060
I wonder if there's a way that I can make it so people can't
log in while I'm streaming.

2402
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:07,500
But like, I'll obviously log in off stream.

2403
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:12,940
But I wonder if there's a way that I could be like, hey,
don't...

2404
02:36:12,940 --> 02:36:14,980
You're not allowed in while I'm streaming.

2405
02:36:16,560 --> 02:36:18,740
But I'm also scared of what I'll see.

2406
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:26,500
Oh my goodness, thank you for the birthday gift, thank you!

2407
02:36:31,410 --> 02:36:33,550
I have a lot to...

2408
02:36:34,210 --> 02:36:38,010
I have a lot to learn and experiment with.

2409
02:36:39,270 --> 02:36:43,230
Please be patient with me.

2410
02:36:44,710 --> 02:36:46,290
Maybe you have multiple servers?

2411
02:36:46,850 --> 02:36:47,210
Maybe.

2412
02:36:48,890 --> 02:36:51,530
But what if I show one server more?

2413
02:36:51,550 --> 02:37:08,250
love than the other that's not so good right I don't know I
don't know the servers are going to compete oh my gosh some

2414
02:37:08,250 --> 02:37:14,690
people will be like I'm server I'm server Zanzibar I'm
server outer heaven and then they'll be like oh my gosh okay

2415
02:37:14,690 --> 02:37:21,210
that we're gonna organize we're gonna organize a takedown of
outer heaven and we're gonna storm in there and we're gonna

2416
02:37:21,210 --> 02:37:38,530
burn everybody's houses what if that happens there will be
war server Rex and Ray server server shagohan not the

2417
02:37:38,530 --> 02:37:45,550
factions made wars

2418
02:37:50,230 --> 02:38:03,930
I can't stop yawning I don't know I'll get some advice from
people and see what I do Luckily Luckily I didn't write

2419
02:38:03,930 --> 02:38:20,630
Minecraft server access In the perks of joining membership
So So You know It We could just...

2420
02:38:20,630 --> 02:38:22,210
We could just...

2421
02:38:23,810 --> 02:38:26,630
We could just pretend it never happened.

2422
02:38:26,730 --> 02:38:27,890
Give more a chance!

2423
02:38:28,230 --> 02:38:28,330
No!

2424
02:38:29,950 --> 02:38:31,410
You could do a lottery.

2425
02:38:32,210 --> 02:38:34,250
Maybe, but I would feel bad about it too.

2426
02:38:35,030 --> 02:38:35,330
I think.

2427
02:38:36,610 --> 02:38:38,530
I think I would feel bad about it too.

2428
02:38:41,090 --> 02:38:42,570
Please don't rush, take your time.

2429
02:38:42,970 --> 02:38:43,730
I will, thank you.

2430
02:38:44,410 --> 02:38:45,130
I will, I will.

2431
02:38:48,550 --> 02:38:58,170
especially because some people keep gifting so many
memberships my god your luck is abysmal

2432
02:39:04,790 --> 02:39:15,850
but also if it's a lottery i don't even know how i would
distribute it like how would i be like okay i would have to

2433
02:39:15,850 --> 02:39:23,930
i don't know i don't want to think about it you know what
let's just Oh, I'm saving that for Future Mint.

2434
02:39:24,550 --> 02:39:26,110
I don't need to worry about it.

2435
02:39:26,290 --> 02:39:27,730
Thank you guys for the gift.

2436
02:39:28,490 --> 02:39:29,170

Thank you.

2439
02:39:35,730 --> 02:39:36,970
But anyway.

2440
02:39:38,910 --> 02:39:39,150
Almost.

2441
02:39:39,450 --> 02:39:39,610
Wait.

2442
02:39:40,190 --> 02:39:40,950
As of today.

2443
02:39:41,870 --> 02:39:43,130
It has been one week.

2444
02:39:43,930 --> 02:39:44,790
Of me back.

2445
02:39:45,790 --> 02:39:46,410
Yippee.

2446
02:39:47,210 --> 02:39:47,890
Oh my gosh.

2447
02:39:47,970 --> 02:39:49,710
Happy one week anniversary.

2448
02:39:50,050 --> 02:39:50,890
Everybody!

2449
02:39:53,170 --> 02:39:57,610
Happy one week to me.

2450
02:39:58,670 --> 02:40:02,710
Happy one week to me.

2451
02:40:04,130 --> 02:40:10,790
Please stop the gifting of memberships.

2452
02:40:11,990 --> 02:40:16,510
Happy one week to me.

2453
02:40:17,630 --> 02:40:20,030
Oh, I can't do high notes.

2454
02:40:20,050 --> 02:40:20,670
anymore.

2455
02:40:21,730 --> 02:40:22,090
My throat.

2456
02:40:22,270 --> 02:40:23,870
I wonder if it will ever recover.

2457
02:40:24,730 --> 02:40:26,990
Maybe I need to drink more honey stuff.

2458
02:40:29,030 --> 02:40:30,350
I have in here.

2459
02:40:30,790 --> 02:40:32,710
Well, this is ginger and yuzu.

2460
02:40:34,190 --> 02:40:35,350
I guess that doesn't really help.

2461
02:40:37,010 --> 02:40:40,010
Before in the past, I used to still sick girl.

2462
02:40:40,110 --> 02:40:40,950
I don't think I'm still sick.

2463
02:40:41,110 --> 02:40:45,450
I think it's just that my voice is...

2464
02:40:45,450 --> 02:40:58,150
Since my voice was so damaged before, it's taking a long
time to recover or you know it like uh that was also another

2465
02:40:58,150 --> 02:41:09,050
reason i um took some time sorry i'm trying to get a this
voice this voice mint out um another reason i took so long

2466
02:41:09,690 --> 02:41:17,470
or not so sorry not took so long another reason i took some
time off the two months in japan was because i wanted to

2467
02:41:17,470 --> 02:41:28,150
rest my voice Because even prior to that, I'd been having
some issues with my...

2468
02:41:28,150 --> 02:41:30,870
Not my voice giving out, but like...

2469
02:41:30,870 --> 02:41:33,530
I could feel it getting a little weaker.

2470
02:41:35,310 --> 02:41:35,750
So...

2471
02:41:40,410 --> 02:41:43,050
But I think I just need to take better care of it too.

2472
02:41:44,690 --> 02:41:45,870
And you totally did that, right?

2473
02:41:46,450 --> 02:41:47,450
You'd be surprised!

2474
02:41:50,050 --> 02:41:58,890
go to idol shows and I wouldn't scream so loud like I would
do like if I did calls I would do them like in my normal

2475
02:41:58,890 --> 02:42:11,610
voice now I wouldn't go so like loud and crazy so didn't you
go to karaoke's yeah sometimes I only went like like four or

2476
02:42:11,610 --> 02:42:21,910
five times I didn't go that often what do you mean extadow
What do you mean?

2477
02:42:22,190 --> 02:42:23,130
I was being good.

2478
02:42:24,130 --> 02:42:26,050
I was being good.

2479
02:42:28,190 --> 02:42:28,410
I was,

2480
02:42:32,590 --> 02:42:33,350
I promise.

2481
02:42:38,170 --> 02:42:38,630
But yeah.

2482
02:42:40,390 --> 02:42:41,450
That's a lot of times.

2483
02:42:41,610 --> 02:42:42,290
In two months?

2484
02:42:43,150 --> 02:42:44,370
Five times is not that much.

2485
02:42:46,090 --> 02:42:46,590
I think.

2486
02:42:48,430 --> 02:42:49,010
Let's go.

2487
02:42:50,070 --> 02:42:51,490
Do you remember the first time I went?

2488
02:42:55,210 --> 02:42:56,170
And then...

2489
02:42:56,170 --> 02:42:58,050
You know, thinking about it now...

2490
02:43:03,590 --> 02:43:05,410
I think I went...

2491
02:43:05,410 --> 02:43:07,530
By myself to karaoke every time.

2492
02:43:08,190 --> 02:43:09,810
I really wanted to go to Pasella.

2493
02:43:10,750 --> 02:43:13,090
Pasella is like one of my favorite...

2494
02:43:13,090 --> 02:43:13,710
Uh...

2495
02:43:13,710 --> 02:43:17,390
Karioki places because they have this yummy honey toast...

2496
02:43:17,390 --> 02:43:18,110
That I like to get.

2497
02:43:18,570 --> 02:43:20,030
Thank you for the five gift that thank you.

2498
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:30,660
Your voice needs roughly a week to heal between heavy, heavy
overuse-ish.

2499
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:36,040
Yeah, but what about, how about sickness?

2500
02:43:40,180 --> 02:43:41,260
Pasella is awesome.

2501
02:43:44,580 --> 02:43:50,220
But, and then they have, they have like the big honey toast
and then they have the small honey toast.

2502
02:43:50,380 --> 02:43:54,100
But the small honey toast, I don't like it so much because,
because it's like,

2503
02:43:57,800 --> 02:44:07,940
it's it's it's it's it's more it's too hard in my opinion

2588
02:49:20,110 --> 02:49:38,550
you it's literally you it's me oh you guys are getting 100
in school man did i talk about my okay i'm gonna talk a

2589
02:49:38,550 --> 02:49:47,090
little bit about the japan school i went to because uh the
japan school the japanese school i went to a little bit um i

2590
02:49:47,090 --> 02:49:53,810
think i mentioned before how i was just like oh yeah like i
don't regret going at all um i had so much fun and i learned

2591
02:49:53,810 --> 02:50:01,630
a lot um i don't remember if i talked about this on stream
before you didn't really mention much i'm not gonna say the

2592
02:50:01,630 --> 02:50:12,310
name or anything obviously but uh the reason i would i would
choose not to go back what kind of school was it it was a

2593
02:50:12,310 --> 02:50:21,350
japanese school like japanese learning school so um the
reason First of all, they were very flexible.

2594
02:50:22,590 --> 02:50:26,250
I originally wanted six months, but they were like, we can't
kind of get you for that.

2595
02:50:26,510 --> 02:50:28,510
So, but we have two months we can give you.

2596
02:50:28,550 --> 02:50:30,790
And I was like, okay, that works fine.

2597
02:50:32,890 --> 02:50:37,670
But when I entered the class, there were people there that,

2598
02:50:41,690 --> 02:50:46,110
there were people there that had been there for like months
and months and months before me.

2599
02:50:47,170 --> 02:50:47,770
And so,

2600
02:50:51,030 --> 02:51:02,110
wasn't the housing situation an issue too no not really they
helped me get a place which was the only issue was it was 20

2601
02:51:02,110 --> 02:51:17,350
minutes away from the train station and you guys I scammed
myself I scammed myself I still I'm still so angry about it

2602
02:51:18,670 --> 02:51:27,010
um it sounds like quite a walk i love walking so i actually
don't mind i like it was only an issue when i was when i was

2603
02:51:27,010 --> 02:51:37,070
uh late in the mornings jr pass no not the jr pass i got the
takiken i got the commuter pass which is like if you're

2604
02:51:37,070 --> 02:51:45,830
staying in japan for a long time highly recommend it if
you're like either going to uh to like you know like for me

2605
02:51:45,830 --> 02:51:54,830
i'm going to the same place every day So, when you get the
pass, you choose two different stations, and every station

2606
02:51:54,830 --> 02:51:59,490
in between that is also included in the pass.

2607
02:52:03,110 --> 02:52:06,150
So, it's super duper duper, super handy.

2608
02:52:06,970 --> 02:52:15,350
I got one once, too, when I actually worked in Akihabara for
a little bit, and I got it from my school to, this was years

2609
02:52:15,350 --> 02:52:19,450
ago, but I got it from my school to Akihabara, so I could go
to Akihabara as well.

2610
02:52:19,470 --> 02:52:24,350
often as I want, I mean, I would say free, but I paid for
it.

2611
02:52:24,890 --> 02:52:36,210
So, but yeah, the take can, um, uh, and so I got it.

2612
02:52:37,030 --> 02:52:38,010
Oh, how do I say, okay.

2613
02:52:39,890 --> 02:52:43,210
My station's name was kind of weird.

2614
02:52:44,070 --> 02:52:46,670
I don't know how to describe it without saying it exactly.

2615
02:52:48,210 --> 02:52:59,370
Um, But when I was putting in the stations, I got the
station that I was like my the station that I went to by my

2616
02:52:59,370 --> 02:53:08,790
apartment to and I thought I put in my station that I got
off for school.

2617
02:53:09,430 --> 02:53:19,450
But no, I put in I put in I didn't realize that I missed a
part on it.

2618
02:53:20,690 --> 02:53:36,170
and so I paid like $150 for it because I had it last two
months and no I'm sorry just a month it was just a month

2619
02:53:36,170 --> 02:53:43,110
because I got it kind of late because I was trying to find
right now there's like a Seika pass shortage so I was trying

2620
02:53:43,110 --> 02:53:57,310
to find a place that would print it I could not find a place
that would even like allow me to get it so it discounted it

2621
02:53:57,310 --> 02:54:13,830
discounted my my um the amount that i spent but ultimately i
ended up like paying double for for my for my tickets and

2622
02:54:13,830 --> 02:54:25,010
only and then because because the the the train was also
weird the trains in between or the stations in between it

2623
02:54:25,010 --> 02:54:30,530
only counted some of them I know I'm sorry I'm being very
vague because I don't want to like just give away where I

2624
02:54:30,530 --> 02:54:43,370
went and everything but it was it was so I was so angry at
myself when I realized I was so mad I was like and you know

2625
02:54:43,370 --> 02:54:54,210
it was my fault I should have double checked salty commute
handling mishap yeah I feel this frustration scamming

2626
02:54:54,210 --> 02:55:03,510
yourself sucks it does it does it does so you know if you
get the if you get the commuter pass definitely double

2627
02:55:03,510 --> 02:55:15,850
triple check and yeah don't be like me luckily you know for
me I could afford it but if you know what if I was you know

2628
02:55:15,850 --> 02:55:28,770
in a worse position I would have been like I would have been
really suffering so that's okay we're no strangers to scam I

2629
02:55:28,770 --> 02:55:36,350
honestly don't know if I could have gotten a refund but I
felt bad about wasting the past if that were the case you

2630
02:55:36,350 --> 02:55:49,770
know what I mean and I don't know I didn't I didn't want to
but yeah that's okay we live and learn or die and learn in

2631
02:55:49,770 --> 02:56:04,910
my case but yeah about the school I I went in where some of
the students were there like many many months before me and

2632
02:56:04,910 --> 02:56:14,650
so you know in the textbook we were learning from it was
like lessons I don't remember 20 let's just say 25 to 50

2633
02:56:14,650 --> 02:56:27,370
okay so they learned from lesson 25 the people that were in
the class i learned well yes then we had this one big test

2634
02:56:27,370 --> 02:56:36,630
that was the entirety of the book so we took that test which
was lessons 25 through 50.

2635
02:56:37,410 --> 02:56:39,850
i came in at lesson 40.

2636
02:56:47,830 --> 02:57:07,490
like no way this sucks oh it sucked so much and because you
know um like i when i like properly learned japanese i you

2637
02:57:07,490 --> 02:57:15,570
know that was so long ago i forgot so much of it and like
especially like tiny tiny things too like the correct way to

2638
02:57:15,570 --> 02:57:26,290
use this this form or whatever whatever so i was like you
know i'm obviously um it was just hard trying to catch up

2639
02:57:26,290 --> 02:57:38,750
but i'm glad because now i'm back into like the mindset of
studying um and i did learn a lot of like kegel um and uh

2640
02:57:38,750 --> 02:57:45,630
yeah so it was good i i do wish also there was like more
talking in the class I don't know.

2641
02:57:45,810 --> 02:57:46,890
I feel like that's so important.

2642
02:57:48,010 --> 02:57:48,890
It's so funny though.

2643
02:57:49,090 --> 02:57:55,030
On my first day, on my first day, it was a pretty small
class.

2644
02:57:57,730 --> 02:58:06,990
someone, someone asked me, like, first of my teacher was
like, oh, Minto, your voice is so cute.

2645
02:58:07,630 --> 02:58:08,910
I was like, no, no, no, no, no.

2646
02:58:09,350 --> 02:58:12,670
And someone in the class, this guy, he was just like, are
you a V-Tuber?

2647
02:58:13,370 --> 02:58:13,650
Oh, no.

2648
02:58:13,730 --> 02:58:26,230
First he asked, are you, are you a are you a voice actor and
i was like no and then he goes and then and then i was like

2649
02:58:26,230 --> 02:58:34,570
no they were like you've never done any voice acting work
like your voice is kind of unique i was like no no i'm i

2650
02:58:34,570 --> 02:58:44,810
just uh i don't know then and then like while i was leaving
because it was at the end of class they were like the guy he

2651
02:58:44,810 --> 02:58:46,770
was just like she's probably a vtuber

2652
02:58:54,450 --> 02:59:03,930
and uh it was so funny because um uh there was a there was a
i ended up like him and this other girl we would go and get

2653
02:59:03,930 --> 02:59:10,370
lunch together after class and like they would he kept what
he would keep asking me he'd be like are you a vtuber are

2654
02:59:10,370 --> 02:59:14,210
you a vtuber are you a vtuber And I'm like, no, no, no, no,
no, no.

2655
02:59:17,910 --> 02:59:20,770
And I think at one point I was like, you know what?

2656
02:59:21,070 --> 02:59:22,570
Maybe I'll mess with him a little bit.

2657
02:59:23,870 --> 02:59:27,030
Because he would ask me, he would be like, are you part of
this company?

2658
02:59:27,150 --> 02:59:28,870
And I was like, no, no, no, no, no.

2659
02:59:31,630 --> 02:59:34,010
Like he asked if I was part of Hollow Live.

2660
02:59:34,270 --> 02:59:35,350
And I was like, no.

2661
02:59:36,950 --> 02:59:38,610
He didn't know VTubers at all.

2662
02:59:38,710 --> 02:59:41,510
He was just like, that's the only thing I know.

2663
02:59:41,530 --> 02:59:50,810
and so I was like I was like no but at one point I was like
you know what I am gonna mess with him I was like you know

2664
02:59:50,810 --> 03:00:02,990
what sorry I I was I was like I was like I I am a vtuber and
and he had a bet going with another guy in our class that I

2665
03:00:02,990 --> 03:00:10,410
was a that I was that I was a vtuber and he was like yes I'm
gonna tell him I was like no no no no don't tell him just

2666
03:00:10,410 --> 03:00:21,770
like you know kind of keep him like on his toes or whatever
and then they would like he would try to ask me stuff and

2667
03:00:21,770 --> 03:00:28,390
the girl too she was just like i can't tell if you're lying
or not and i was like what what do you mean

2668
03:00:32,410 --> 03:00:38,650
and like and um he would be like if you're really a vtuber
tell me a story and i was just like

2669
03:00:42,590 --> 03:00:47,070
I was like, I can't, you know, like, that's too private.

2670
03:00:47,530 --> 03:00:49,170
I don't wanna be found out.

2671
03:00:50,030 --> 03:00:56,910
And then, okay, so this whole, the whole like two months, I
was keeping this up.

2672
03:00:57,330 --> 03:01:02,530
And on the very last day, we went and like, the three of us
went and got coffee.

2673
03:01:03,050 --> 03:01:04,850
And he looked at me and he's just like, you know what?

2674
03:01:05,070 --> 03:01:06,370
You really had me going.

2675
03:01:06,710 --> 03:01:09,970
I really thought that you were a VTuber.

2676
03:01:16,510 --> 03:01:19,150
And I was like, gotcha.

2677
03:01:25,190 --> 03:01:27,590
It was so, it was so silly.

2678
03:01:27,830 --> 03:01:29,650
I was like, no way.

2679
03:01:30,430 --> 03:01:32,330
They just didn't believe me at all.

2680
03:01:32,810 --> 03:01:35,750
Like, she, she was so, they were both very nice.

2681
03:01:36,050 --> 03:01:42,270
But, um, like, when I say I'm an introvert, like, I am a
true introvert.

2682
03:01:43,850 --> 03:01:54,830
introverted than me so I'm the one like trying to start all
the conversations and I'm just like the weather it's so hot

2683
03:01:54,830 --> 03:02:09,690
today like it was crazy it was crazy how much I was like how
much I was like oh my god I'm having to pretend I'm an

2684
03:02:09,690 --> 03:02:18,930
extrovert here it would be a little awkward it would be
because we would just be eating in silence for a long time

2685
03:02:18,930 --> 03:02:33,850
but it was good mmm it was it was still a fun time I got to
do a lot and quiet classmates it would be so funny because

2686
03:02:33,850 --> 03:02:46,390
we would be like sitting in silence in our classroom there
was only ever six of us at the most in a class at a time.

2687
03:02:46,870 --> 03:02:53,590
Yeah, and we would be sitting there in silence and we would
hear like the class next door like...

2688
03:02:54,830 --> 03:02:55,710
What do you mean?

2689
03:02:55,710 --> 03:02:56,850
Slap my own joke.

2690
03:02:57,250 --> 03:02:57,750
Shut up!

2691
03:03:01,770 --> 03:03:07,710
But we would hear the class next to us laugh and like be
really loud and energetic and we're all just sitting there

2692
03:03:07,710 --> 03:03:09,670
like, how did we all...

2693
03:03:09,670 --> 03:03:12,710
How did... How did we all get in...

2694
03:03:12,710 --> 03:03:13,570
How did all the...

2695
03:03:13,590 --> 03:03:15,790
this class be only introverts.

2696
03:03:15,930 --> 03:03:16,750
I don't understand.

2697
03:03:28,530 --> 03:03:30,050
But yeah.

2698
03:03:31,510 --> 03:03:32,890
Cast lighting is fun.

2699
03:03:33,230 --> 03:03:33,870
Oh, wait.

2700
03:03:37,690 --> 03:03:38,830
But yeah.

2701
03:03:39,370 --> 03:03:40,090
It was, so.

2702
03:03:42,170 --> 03:03:49,290
I, I, I, did enjoy my time i don't think like you know i'm
not like i never thought like oh this was such a waste of

2703
03:03:49,290 --> 03:03:58,890
money i think i had a good experience and i always wanted to
why are you guys spamming stop it

wasn't like okay you are taking n2 class it wasn't anything

i would much rather like feel confident and feel good in my

2707
03:04:37,370 --> 03:04:45,830

enhance that too of course like you know setting for the

2708
03:04:45,830 --> 03:04:56,930
jlpt i mean um but but i would rather just be like oh yeah i
can i can talk and hang out and i don't need a piece of

2709
03:04:56,930 --> 03:05:04,010
paper to to say that or not i took the exam just to see if
i'm already on that level that's okay too like if you want

2710

nihongo-jaro but you know I'm Gumbari Masuing my way through

2711
03:05:17,950 --> 03:05:38,030
life did you get all bees no I got good grades I got good
grades sitting in kanji is so difficult it can be I I've

2712
03:05:38,030 --> 03:05:48,450
honestly so I have found the most help with wani-kani for
kanji but if you're wanting to know how to write it it's

2713
03:05:48,450 --> 03:05:56,790
impossible like i can i can't i can't write anything i can
see so many kanji and recognize them and read them and

2714
03:05:56,790 --> 03:06:10,050
everything but i cannot write it at all but wani kanji is
really is has been the most um helpful for me at least just

2715
03:06:10,050 --> 03:06:18,070
use my keyboard exactly exactly I mean, there's already,
isn't that an issue in Japan too?

2716
03:06:18,170 --> 03:06:20,590
There's people who don't know how to write so much anymore?

2717
03:06:23,930 --> 03:06:27,090
Um, but, uh, yeah.

2718
03:06:27,990 --> 03:06:32,730
I wonder, is that like an issue in like, you know, like in
China?

2719
03:06:32,890 --> 03:06:39,630
Is that also an issue or so many people type that they can't
be Hong Kong?

2720
03:06:41,570 --> 03:06:43,210
That they can't write so much anymore?

2721
03:06:44,690 --> 03:07:00,770
yeah it is what is this what is this it's an issue in the
USA too to be honest okay so kind of true yeah my dad can

2722
03:07:00,770 --> 03:07:02,970

Even though this is on a mouse.

2748
03:09:18,450 --> 03:09:21,190
So it might, it's already gonna be ugly, but don't worry

No, you guys have to give me feedback.

Looks like a whale.

03:10:44,430 --> 03:10:46,170
I thought it was a whale.

2761
03:10:47,990 --> 03:10:48,790

like a big you know like that that's the M.

2769
03:11:54,910 --> 03:11:57,150
It doesn't have to make perfect sense.

2770
03:11:57,350 --> 03:12:02,550
Like, it can be like, you know, and then we could like, I
and T.

2771
03:12:04,590 --> 03:12:05,670
And like, then here

2772
03:12:11,530 --> 03:12:12,390
It's me.

2773
03:12:16,810 --> 03:12:18,390
And then here.

2774
03:12:20,350 --> 03:12:25,050
And, um, Is that an Among Us?

2775
03:12:25,210 --> 03:12:25,650
No!

2776
03:12:27,270 --> 03:12:28,730
You're not seeing the vision.

2777
03:12:29,150 --> 03:12:30,150
You're not seeing the vision.

2778
03:12:30,230 --> 03:12:30,450
Hold on.

2779
03:12:30,510 --> 03:12:31,350
Let's change this one.

2780
03:12:31,770 --> 03:12:33,470
I'm going to make it a little bit more exciting.

2781
03:12:33,990 --> 03:12:35,990
Like, um.

2782
03:12:39,430 --> 03:12:40,170
Like that.

2783
03:12:41,210 --> 03:12:41,610
Um.

2784
03:12:42,490 --> 03:12:42,750
Um.

2785
03:12:43,290 --> 03:12:44,030
It's a diglet.

2786
03:12:44,090 --> 03:12:45,790
Oh, now it's just Wabafet.

2787
03:12:48,430 --> 03:12:50,070
Would it be better if he did it in Kana?

2788
03:12:50,710 --> 03:12:51,310
So, hi, Mint.

2789
03:12:51,410 --> 03:12:52,410
First time seeing you.

2790
03:12:52,430 --> 03:12:53,250
Hi, Coke's Metal.

2791
03:12:53,630 --> 03:12:54,430
Thank you.

2792
03:12:55,850 --> 03:12:57,790
I could try and do it.

2793
03:12:58,070 --> 03:13:01,050
My name is spelled in katakana, not hiragana.

2794
03:13:03,370 --> 03:13:07,330
So, I think in katakana, I would look ugly.

2795
03:13:08,230 --> 03:13:08,710
Like, hold on.

2796
03:13:10,050 --> 03:13:12,350
Like, because katakana is this.

2797
03:13:13,530 --> 03:13:15,970
Mi-toto.

2798
03:13:16,430 --> 03:13:17,650
I can't even write it well.

2799
03:13:18,370 --> 03:13:22,770
Mi-toto.

2800
03:13:26,570 --> 03:13:30,070
There's no way to make this look cute, I think.

2801
03:13:31,150 --> 03:13:32,010
As a signature.

2802
03:13:35,230 --> 03:13:36,330
Must be hiragana.

2803
03:13:37,670 --> 03:13:39,470
Yeah, hiragana is so much cuter.

2804
03:13:40,550 --> 03:13:41,270
I'm such a fool.

2805
03:13:41,370 --> 03:13:43,170
Why didn't I write my name in hiragana?

2806
03:13:43,710 --> 03:13:44,990
I'm going to change it today.

2807
03:13:45,850 --> 03:13:46,330
Minto.

2808
03:13:50,170 --> 03:13:50,650
Minto.

2809
03:13:55,870 --> 03:13:56,350
Toe.

2810
03:13:56,470 --> 03:13:56,650
Stop.

2811
03:13:56,970 --> 03:13:57,730
Not mean.

2812
03:13:58,510 --> 03:13:58,690
Toe.

2813
03:13:59,710 --> 03:14:00,190
Hmm.

2814
03:14:01,050 --> 03:14:01,790
Give us your best.

2815
03:14:02,110 --> 03:14:03,530
Wow, Buffett.

2816
03:14:06,850 --> 03:14:07,150
Ah.

2817
03:14:10,290 --> 03:14:10,770
Yeah.

2818
03:14:15,590 --> 03:14:16,770
Look at this one.

2819
03:14:17,350 --> 03:14:18,010
This is what.

2820
03:14:18,130 --> 03:14:18,710
This is what.

2821
03:14:18,810 --> 03:14:19,650
This is what.

2822
03:14:20,390 --> 03:14:21,090
Look at this one.

2823
03:14:21,170 --> 03:14:21,330
Hold on.

2824
03:14:21,350 --> 03:14:22,270
I'm going to save it.

2825
03:14:23,570 --> 03:14:25,350
This is what we're aiming for, you guys.

2826
03:14:26,030 --> 03:14:27,890
This level of... This level.

2827
03:14:31,590 --> 03:14:48,550
this why is it so big I do kind of like the direction like
this direction if I don't make it a wabba fit I think it

2828
03:14:48,550 --> 03:14:59,130
could be kind of cute like uh hold on there's some that are
like this um maybe oh oh maybe like uh maybe like a Miffy

2829
03:14:59,130 --> 03:14:59,710
face.

2830
03:15:00,790 --> 03:15:01,350
Miffy.

2831
03:15:02,350 --> 03:15:03,690
I love Miffy.

2832
03:15:10,750 --> 03:15:13,370
Give it sleeves, arms.

2833
03:15:13,970 --> 03:15:15,070
I don't think that'll work.

2834
03:15:16,190 --> 03:15:18,170
I think it makes it look so ugly.

2835
03:15:22,750 --> 03:15:24,910
I think it makes it look ugly.

2836
03:15:25,490 --> 03:15:26,170
That's okay, though.

2837
03:15:29,070 --> 03:15:29,630
Hmm.

2838
03:15:31,810 --> 03:15:34,810
Every time you say minto, it sounds like mentos.

2839
03:15:36,270 --> 03:15:37,630
Let's see this one.

2840
03:15:45,400 --> 03:15:45,960
Hmm.

2841
03:15:54,860 --> 03:15:57,020
Make the sleeve into an M.

2842
03:15:57,620 --> 03:15:57,780
What?

2843
03:15:58,400 --> 03:15:59,540
How does that happen?

2844
03:16:01,380 --> 03:16:02,900
How does, how, how, how, how?

2845
03:16:03,320 --> 03:16:03,620
Hmm.

2846
03:16:07,280 --> 03:16:09,320
Or, um, let's see.

2847
03:16:11,700 --> 03:16:15,100
Uh, uh, uh.

2848
03:16:24,220 --> 03:16:26,440
Wait, that's actually not so bad.

2849
03:16:28,880 --> 03:16:30,480
With the little tongue out.

2850
03:16:31,520 --> 03:16:33,320
Like it, like me, like me.

2851
03:16:37,360 --> 03:16:37,920
Tap out.

2852
03:16:51,610 --> 03:16:53,270
We're on to something.

2853
03:16:56,010 --> 03:17:01,810
And then I could add like some...

2854
03:17:03,370 --> 03:17:04,290
Little...

2855
03:17:05,950 --> 03:17:06,650
Mmm.

2856
03:17:15,110 --> 03:17:15,750
Tehepero.

2857
03:17:16,250 --> 03:17:17,690
What can I add?

2858
03:17:19,960 --> 03:17:22,600
I would put like little sparklies maybe.

2859
03:17:28,570 --> 03:17:34,210
I think I would look better if it's like you know how like
in idol master when they show their signatures they're like

2860
03:17:34,210 --> 03:17:43,950
all sparkly they're like They're glowing and they're all
sparkly in the eyes make it look like Gengar Maybe it would

2861
03:17:43,950 --> 03:17:52,010
look maybe I mean also it's drawn on my with my mouse so
We're workshopping it we're workshopping it.

2862
03:17:52,310 --> 03:17:53,350
It's my signature.

2863
03:17:53,470 --> 03:17:58,950
You don't have to like it except people who are getting it
on a postcard and have to look at it every time You'll see

2864
03:17:58,950 --> 03:17:59,310
it.

2865
03:17:59,810 --> 03:18:04,270
You're going to look at this guy's little face and you're
going to be like, oh, no.

2866
03:18:05,010 --> 03:18:05,730
Oh, no.

2867
03:18:09,750 --> 03:18:09,950
Hmm.

2868
03:18:13,130 --> 03:18:14,530
Idol master signatures are nice.

2869
03:18:14,630 --> 03:18:15,810
Yeah, that's what I'm looking at.

2870
03:18:16,270 --> 03:18:18,630
Well, I'm looking at just like idol signatures in general.

2871
03:18:19,770 --> 03:18:20,730
For inspiration.

2872
03:18:22,830 --> 03:18:30,970
But most of them are like so complex because they do, they
do like, a lot they have like the cut like yeah the kanji

2873
03:18:30,970 --> 03:18:40,350
incorporated and things like that it's and then it's easier
i feel like with hiragana because it's so it's so loopy hmm

2874
03:18:40,350 --> 03:18:57,370
like uh like if i did like if i did the minto in like oh
wrong way like something like that and then you have like

2875
03:18:57,370 --> 03:19:08,550
this and and like this and like you know or here and then
like that for the toe like it's they're always so crazy you

2876
03:19:08,550 --> 03:19:25,690
know and then and then when you do it like that and then it
has like a face in here it's like a kind of like that like

2877
03:19:25,690 --> 03:19:32,310
they always go so crazy with them The face is essential for
my branding.

2878
03:19:34,910 --> 03:19:37,310
Can't you try to write mint normally as your signature?

2879
03:19:38,130 --> 03:19:38,210
No!

2880
03:19:43,680 --> 03:19:44,220
No.

2881
03:19:45,520 --> 03:19:46,980
Must be perfect from the beginning.

2882
03:19:50,560 --> 03:19:52,320
And to can't just be my ugly handwriting.

2883
03:19:58,820 --> 03:20:00,620
That has to be special.

2884
03:20:02,720 --> 03:20:03,780
Can, can, can, can't.

2885
03:20:03,800 --> 03:20:05,940
Look at the membership, thank you!

2886
03:20:09,930 --> 03:20:12,650
Can we make custom mint signatures in your art tag?

2887
03:20:12,850 --> 03:20:15,690
You can, but I prefer to make my own.

2888
03:20:17,490 --> 03:20:20,330
So, if you do, I will not use it.

2889
03:20:20,450 --> 03:20:22,870
I can tell you that now, but I appreciate it.

2890
03:20:23,490 --> 03:20:24,870
I just can't, I won't use it.

2891
03:20:25,230 --> 03:20:29,530
Because I prefer to come up with that on my own.

2892
03:20:33,170 --> 03:20:35,190
Gotta add a doodle for pizzazz.

2893
03:20:37,110 --> 03:20:44,630
is fuller but yeah no i think i'll go with i'll i'll start
with this it kind of looks like funashi

2894
03:20:51,470 --> 03:20:58,210
minto with papyrus it's like when you when you have some of
those doc have you ever like filled out the document like

2895
03:20:58,210 --> 03:21:03,770
the doc you signed things and instead of like actually
drawing a signature it's like you can type your signature

2896
03:21:03,770 --> 03:21:09,290
and it counts as your signature It's me with the...

2897
03:21:11,870 --> 03:21:13,270
Me with the...

2898
03:21:13,270 --> 03:21:16,450
With the, with the, with the, with the, comic sans, with the
papyrus.

2899
03:21:20,250 --> 03:21:24,110
If I were to write mint, I would have to be, like, done
so...

2900
03:21:25,510 --> 03:21:27,250
Okay, like, here's an example.

2901
03:21:27,430 --> 03:21:28,510
I mean, these are...

2902
03:21:28,510 --> 03:21:37,550
It's so hard, like, with these ones, because a lot of them
are their kanji, but just to give you an idea, Here's some

2903
03:21:37,550 --> 03:21:38,770
Idol Master ones.

2904
03:21:39,530 --> 03:21:41,270
Riyamu's is so cute.

2905
03:21:41,410 --> 03:21:43,210

Yeah.

2909
03:21:51,290 --> 03:21:52,150
Then, here.

2910
03:21:53,670 --> 03:21:55,590
Mine fits right in, you guys.

2911
03:21:57,750 --> 03:22:02,330
It's like, it's like, we're, it's, it just fits perfectly
right in there.

2912
03:22:02,430 --> 03:22:02,830
Oh my gosh.

2913
03:22:03,610 --> 03:22:04,170

2914
03:22:07,110 --> 03:22:12,110
Oh my gosh, Huey, thank you for the 50s.

2915
03:22:19,130 --> 03:22:23,110

2916
03:22:25,110 --> 03:22:26,870
The really...

2917
03:22:26,870 --> 03:22:28,130
Maybe if I...

2918
03:22:28,130 --> 03:22:31,890
Oh, I don't know.

2919
03:22:34,970 --> 03:22:36,230
I don't know.

2920
03:22:37,110 --> 03:22:37,850
I'll figure it out.

2921
03:22:40,170 --> 03:22:41,150
I'll figure it out.

2922
03:22:41,710 --> 03:22:43,290
You should be on this boat!

2923
03:22:45,490 --> 03:22:47,410
Mitsumi no Yuika signature is the best.

2924
03:22:47,510 --> 03:22:49,010
Wait, which one is that one?

2925
03:22:55,730 --> 03:22:56,150
Oh.

2926
03:22:56,770 --> 03:22:57,610
Oh wait, there it is.

2927
03:22:59,410 --> 03:23:00,170
Wait, is it?

2928
03:23:01,290 --> 03:23:02,310
It's so cute.

2929
03:23:02,490 --> 03:23:02,950
Oh wait!

2930
03:23:03,190 --> 03:23:04,050
It has the high!

2931
03:23:04,270 --> 03:23:05,570
Oh my gosh, that's so cute.

2932
03:23:07,830 --> 03:23:09,570
That's so cute.

2933
03:23:11,690 --> 03:23:13,110
I'll show you guys too.

2934
03:23:20,960 --> 03:23:21,580
Like, look at that.

2935
03:23:21,800 --> 03:23:22,580
They're so crazy.

2936
03:23:23,580 --> 03:23:26,900
But, and then, of course, the kanji always, like, makes it
so much more.

2937
03:23:27,140 --> 03:23:33,280
See, that's why I was like, oh, you know, I can do, like,
stars or whatever in it, little circles.

2938
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:35,680
Make, just dress it up a little bit.

2939
03:23:36,340 --> 03:23:39,220
I love, I love circular autographs.

2940
03:23:40,040 --> 03:23:41,220
Maybe because they look so...

2941
03:23:43,020 --> 03:23:58,560
um maybe because they look so nice on shikishi like you know
this this the the busyness like just shows up so well circ

2942
03:23:58,560 --> 03:24:04,940
yeah like a stamp yeah yeah it is very aesthetically
pleasing but with my name i don't really have any circles

2943
03:24:04,940 --> 03:24:11,400
which is why i would have to make the mint or the m like the
biggest circular part maybe unless i like circled my name

2944
03:24:11,400 --> 03:24:13,730
and wrote wrote it on the inside but

2945
03:24:17,080 --> 03:24:29,060
is there a kanji for mint maybe but but you could do minto
and have the o go all around oh you're cooking you're

2946
03:24:29,060 --> 03:24:43,040
cooking so like oh i do like having it like a butt m too
wait oh No.

2947
03:24:46,680 --> 03:24:47,800
Min-to.

2948
03:24:50,260 --> 03:24:52,540
Um, I-I-Round.

Thank you for the time, gift, and thank you.

2950
03:24:54,680 --> 03:24:57,360
Um, um.

2951
03:25:03,300 --> 03:25:04,420
Min-to.

2952
03:25:05,780 --> 03:25:06,340
Why can't I?

2953
03:25:06,520 --> 03:25:06,940
Why can't?

2954
03:25:08,240 --> 03:25:09,360
Min-to.

2955
03:25:13,160 --> 03:25:15,240
Just looks like I circled my name.

2956
03:25:31,750 --> 03:25:33,450

2957
03:25:36,890 --> 03:25:54,010

Tomodachi life, yeah, will create some crazy situations.

2962
03:26:15,470 --> 03:26:19,510
Last time I played, none of my people got married, so that's
the goal.

2963
