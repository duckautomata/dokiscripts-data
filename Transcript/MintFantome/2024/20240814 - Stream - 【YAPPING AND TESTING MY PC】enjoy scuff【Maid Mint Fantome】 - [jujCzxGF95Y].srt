1
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,780
Is this thing on?

2
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,020
Is this thing on?

3
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,450
Hello?

4
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,060
Can you hear me?

5
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,000
Is it working?

6
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,180
Am I alive?

7
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,180
No.

8
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,700
Am I alive?

9
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,200
Am I?

10
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,520
It sounds good?

11
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Am I good?

12
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,620
I'm muted?

13
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,860
Stream muted?

14
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,020
Don't lie to me.

15
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,120
Is she talking?

16
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,000
Wait, I can't tell.

17
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,100
Am I actually muted?

18
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,480
Now I'm confused.

19
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,020
Wait, am I muted?

20
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,880
Oh, I'm not muted.

21
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,440
Stop lying to me.

22
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,500
Hi, Minto.

23
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,060
Oh my god.

24
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,420
Welcome back, Minto.

25
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,060
Thank you.

26
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,760
Thanks.

27
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,380
Thanks for the Hakusupa.

28
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,640
Thanks for all the members.

29
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,220
Welcome back, Minto.

30
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,660
Thanks.

31
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,860
We hear you.

32
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,100
Oh my god.

33
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,500
It doesn't even feel like I've been gone because I've been doing so many things.

34
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,120
Can you hear my PC going?

35
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,820
Can you hear it?

36
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,140
It's making... it's a little loud.

37
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,920
It feels like...

38
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,540
...you've been gone.

39
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,060
I've been doing events and stuff, so...

40
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,660
If it was your birthday last week, but your Oshi wasn't around so long ago to wish you a happy birthday, did you get any older?

41
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,560
Happy late birthday, Korin.

42
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm assuming you're talking about P jewelery.

43
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,200
Boosting my volume?

44
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,780
Wait am I quiet Blahblahblah.

45
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,100
Wait no, I'm not quiet.

46
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,520
I don't think.

47
00:05:59,620 --> 00:05:59,820
Wait.

48
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,660
No, don't turn that on.

49
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,420
What the hell?

50
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,260
Is the music okay?

51
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,480
Thank you for the anime Revo concert.

52
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,740
I have a wisp plushie.

53
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,740
I could be louder, seriously?

54
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,980
But on OBS it's showing me in the red.

55
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,200
That's crazy.

56
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,760
Huh?

57
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:31,880
There's music?

58
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,460
Oh, I'll turn it up.

59
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:38,810
There you go.

60
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,200
Really nice to finally attend one of your meet and greets that I've talked with on your reaction when you found out I was made with priceless and made me happy.

61
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,720
Hope you had a nice time when you were here in Montreal.

62
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Yeah, oh my gosh.

63
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,680
I... I... I... I went to...

64
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,020
Toronto?

65
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,820
Wait, where's anime Revo?

66
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,080
Wait, anime Revo...

67
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,700
Vancouver?

68
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,600
Just kidding.

69
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,360
Sorry, Toronto.

70
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,340
Wait, but what's the other one in Toronto?

71
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,210
Anime North!

72
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,230
Yeah, yeah, I didn't go there.

73
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,430
I went to Vancouver.

74
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,230
I went to Montreal.

75
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,670
I went to the UK.

76
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,510
All in the span of like three weeks.

77
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,270
Two weeks.

78
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,930
Oh my god.

79
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,670
Everything's crazy.

80
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,130
Please anime North next year.

81
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,490
I mean, I kind of... I was...

82
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,830
I guess I was technically in the parking lot.

83
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,290
Minto Worldwide.

84
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,230
I know.

85
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,310
And then I don't know if you guys saw but I got announced for a concert here in Malaysia.

86
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,130
And~~ Umm...

87
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,930
More to come, too.

88
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,250
We coming to Malaysia?

89
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:36,870
Yeah.

90
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,470
We're going there, too.

91
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,450
Hold on, let me find it.

92
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,950
I retweeted it, I think.

93
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,450
I'll have more stuff of my normal setup later.

94
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,810
It's called Vmuse.

95
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,830
This... hold on, I'm saving the picture.

96
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,690
I'm saving the picture.

97
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,450
I go to OBS.

98
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,510
I load the picture.

99
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,710
This... Yippee!

100
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,550
Yeah!

101
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,070
Selfie there.

102
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,790
Worldwide Minto.

103
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,530
Real.

104
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,190
Thanks for the free super.

105
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,090
No, thank you!

106
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,010
Yeah.

107
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,510
And...

108
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,970
Yeah, how have you guys been?

109
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,750
Oh my gosh, it's been...

110
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,610
too long since I streamed.

111
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,270
I'm really sorry.

112
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,150
It didn't feel, like I said, since I've been doing so much.

113
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,610
Stummy, stop looking at my tummy.

114
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,850
Since I...

115
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,810
Since I have been doing so much, like, offline.

116
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,970
But events?

117
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,990
It still feels like I've been streaming, but not really, you know.

118
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,890
The MC from your concert at Annie Revo auctions off his shirt at the end of the con every year.

119
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:00,990
As a tradition.

120
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,660
Did you get it?

121
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,100
I was the solid Minto of Vexpo.

122
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,420
I feel the need to apologize for spilling my spaghet...

123
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:12,680
Stop!

124
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,500
I was too nervous to properly talk.

125
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,060
I won't say that.

126
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,740
I'm endlessly thankful.

127
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,560
Stop!

128
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,460
You were fine!

129
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,200
Go, stop it!

130
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,120
Thanks for coming to my hometown of Montreal.

131
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,780
I was the samurai...

132
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,020
I know!

133
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,040
I know you were the samurai cosplayer.

134
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,440
I just started my new job.

135
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,340
Can I get a moe-moe?

136
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,040
Good luck, Bim!

137
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:34,780
Moe!

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,520
Moe!

139
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,840
Good luck!

140
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,060
Bim!

141
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,560
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

142
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,300
Good luck!

143
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,540
Oh, wrong word.

144
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,300
Bim!

145
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,400
Nobody saw.

146
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,660
Nobody saw.

147
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,980
Nobody saw.

148
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,350
I just finished watching an MGS4 VOD epilogue and I'm an emotional mess.

149
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,670
Yeah, the Metal Gear episode of the podcast released.

150
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,390
I missed you so much.

151
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,130
Thanks, Nan!

152
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,250
I missed you guys too, kind of.

153
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,110
Don't tell you guys, though, that I missed you guys.

154
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,490
It's a secret.

155
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,830
Nobody, you guys can't know.

156
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,610
You guys can't know that I missed you guys.

157
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:42,990
Wait.

158
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,850
She missed us.

159
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,570
No, I didn't.

160
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,170
I'm telling you, I didn't miss you guys.

161
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,610
At all.

162
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,190
But I did miss you guys.

163
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,810
You just can't know that I missed you guys.

164
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,050
That's all.

165
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,110
She didn't miss us.

166
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,450
But yeah, I'm in Japan.

167
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,110
For those who don't know, I'm in Japan.

168
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,030
I'm in Nihon.

169
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,970
I've been here for some time.

170
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,270
For about a week.

171
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,350
Almost a little under a week now.

172
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,610
She missed us.

173
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,870
Thank you guys for all the super chats.

174
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,670
Thank you.

175
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,550
Remember that third option you showed us at your docket rallies?

176
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,890
It's the same pose as Johnny Akiba in MGS1.

177
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,130
Release image for Metal Gear.

178
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,030
No, because Dayui...

179
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,470
Dayui sent me like more...

180
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,090
You guys wanna see?

181
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,170
Dayui sent me some more things.

182
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,310
Some more previews.

183
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,630
I think you guys will...

184
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,810
Hold on, I'll show you guys this one.

185
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,040
They were like...

186
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,880
They like messaged me.

187
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,620
They were like...

188
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,500
I hope you don't get in trouble with YouTube.

189
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,880
We're showing the...

190
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,300
The other one.

191
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,760
I was like, nah, we're all good.

192
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,320
I think YouTube's a coward.

193
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,620
They're not gonna do anything to me.

194
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,480
I say as my channel gets nuked right now.

195
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,380
It was amazing to see you sing and passing my spoons.

196
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,440
Thank you.

197
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,580
Okay, hold on.

198
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,140
Let me show you guys this version first.

199
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,860
And then you guys tell me.

200
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay?

201
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,300
Hold on though.

202
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,160
Let me make sure I make it small.

203
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,520
So YouTube doesn't get mad.

204
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,500
Okay.

205
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,520
Okay.

206
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,580
Alrighty.

207
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,020
Alrighty.

208
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,380
Alrighty.

209
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,680
Alrighty.

210
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,700
Okay.

211
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,040
Okay.

212
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,320
Okay.

213
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,760
Okay.

214
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,640
Okay.

215
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:47,780
Okay.

216
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:47,880
Okay.

217
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,280
Okay.

218
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,420
Okay.

219
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,020
Okay.

220
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,320
Okay.

221
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,840
Okay.

222
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,240
Okay.

223
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,320
Okay.

224
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,820
It's cute.

225
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,120
It's cute.

226
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,120
It's cute.

227
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,560
So...

228
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,280
You know it's still a little bit of spice.

229
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,720
And then it's gone.

230
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,380
That's your preview.

231
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,920
That's your preview of the other side of the Ducky Makura.

232
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,340
See!

233
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,360
Stop!

234
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,820
You guys are making me embarrassed!

235
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,680
Wait!

236
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,860
Spicy goes, wait I'm embarrassed now!

237
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,800
Stop!

238
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,170
I got to meet you.

239
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,010
I'm expo this weekend.

240
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,170
I was so nervous I forgot to even give my name.

241
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,890
Thank you for meeting all of us.

242
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,450
That was a pleasure.

243
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,110
Thanks George!

244
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,650
Thanks for coming to meet me.

245
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,470
You've done this to yourself.

246
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,870
You can... well it's really Dayui's influence.

247
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,370
Because they were like...

248
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,130
I feel like it would be a disservice to not have your butt out.

249
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,310
Because of the moles.

250
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,690
And I was like...

251
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,790
Maybe you're right!

252
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,430
Because originally I wanted to have it like...

253
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:37,030
You know how some Ducky Makura will have like a horizontal size?

254
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,470
I wanted it to be a little more horizontal with me like hugging a wisp plushie.

255
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,510
Because I don't really...

256
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,330
I was like... I don't know...

257
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,030
I mean having a Ducky Makura is like...

258
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,090
I guess a sort of implication?

259
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,590
I don't even know...

260
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,590
I don't know.

261
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,470
But I was just like...

262
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,550
I don't even know if people...

263
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,090
If you guys like...

264
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,590
Will even be like...

265
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,830
Oh this is kind of weird Minto.

266
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,030
I don't see you like that.

267
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:04,530
You know?

268
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,690
I don't...

269
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,210
I don't know!

270
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,610
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

271
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,430
I'm embarrassed.

272
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,070
Oh

273
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,780
my god.

274
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,560
I'm just embarrassed.

275
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,940
I'm a streamer so...

276
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,620
If I buy the Ducky it will be the most embarrassing thing I own and I own some embarrassing things.

277
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,320
But to me I'm also just like... I like...

278
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,500
Well like I own Ducky Makuras of my friends.

279
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,740
Like I own a Ducky Makura of Yua.

280
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,300
She's another Vtuber.

281
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,580
And...

282
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,180
But you know...

283
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,520
I mean...

284
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,640
Well I kind of slobber on it.

285
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,100
I'm like...

286
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,120
Don't slobber on my Ducky Makura maybe.

287
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,750
Don't slobber on my Ducky Makura maybe.

288
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,860
Minto it's my birthday today.

289
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,000
I love your streams so much.

290
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,620
Thanks for always putting a big smile on my face.

291
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,140
Wait you can reply to people's super chats now.

292
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,440
What is this?

293
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,180
Hooray happy birthday!

294
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,560
Happy birthday to you.

295
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,120
Happy birthday to you.

296
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,220
Happy birthday dear Ray.

297
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,140
Happy birthday to you.

298
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,980
Happy birthday to you.

299
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,000
Happy birthday to you.

300
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,300
Happy birthday to you.

301
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,240
Wow like kind of...

302
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,500
Wow it's like the chat is so orange now.

303
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,900
I promised nothing.

304
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,060
My dog will slobber on it.

305
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,780
My dog will slobber on it.

306
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,700
That dog in you right?

307
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,000
You got that dog in you.

308
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,500
The dog and me will slobber all over it.

309
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,280
Orange?

310
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,360
It's like a yellow-orange.

311
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,000
But also, maybe it's my laptop, right?

312
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,320
Yellow-orange.

313
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,660
Yeah, oh!

314
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,740
Another thing!

315
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,880
Okay, you guys.

316
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,320
So you're probably just like, What adventures has Minto gotten up to in Japan?

317
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,680
Because she's been here for a couple days.

318
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,520
She's probably gone shopping.

319
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,760
She's probably gone to Akihabara a million times.

320
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,740
She's probably gone to every maid cafe.

321
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,480
You guys?

322
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,580
I forgot my wallet at home.

323
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,690
You guys?

324
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,930
I have no cash.

325
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,310
I have no means of withdrawing cash.

326
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,630
I have no credit card.

327
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,990
I am...

328
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,210
I am...

329
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,170
I'm living off the yenis in my pocket.

330
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,590
I have nothing.

331
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,170
So...

332
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,850
Luckily though...

333
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,050
I've been actually...

334
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,350
So I came a little bit early because...

335
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,790
Some scheduling stuff.

336
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,630
Wasn't supposed to come so early.

337
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,650
Because of that too, I'll also be like hotel hopping a little bit.

338
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,270
So...

339
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,210
It's a little...

340
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,710
Annoying.

341
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,510
But...

342
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,690
But actually I have...

343
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,250
I've met up with Sakana.

344
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,570
From Face Connect.

345
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,510
And he's been helping me pay for food.

346
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,990
Thank you for the dono!

347
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,490
Thank you!

348
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,830
I've been listening to Kesha recently and her songs.

349
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,350
Tear It Off really fits you, Minto.

350
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,230
Lots of talks of freaks.

351
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:09,850
Oh, let's go.

352
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,730
Face Connect.

353
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,870
He's been helping me...

354
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,390
Pay for food.

355
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,030
And...

356
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,210
Somebody is super chatty.

357
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,170
I have no card to use.

358
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,170
I have to stop.

359
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,250
My roommate actually...

360
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,710
This is where...

361
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,690
This is why I was...

362
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,310
I brought this up.

363
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,050
My roommate actually sent...

364
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:30,350
My...

365
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,130
My...

366
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,610
My...

367
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:32,790
Wallet.

368
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,130
And I've been checking the tracking every day.

369
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,490
I've been like, please get here sooner.

370
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,510
But...

371
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,550
But...

372
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,350
Another thing.

373
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,010
This was supposed to come before I left.

374
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,810
Unfortunately it didn't.

375
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,070
But they...

376
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,930
It did come...

377
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,870
By the time that they...

378
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,730
It literally came the day after I left.

379
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,170
But my roommate sent it with my wallet.

380
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,730
I got...

381
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,070
The...

382
00:20:59,090 --> 00:20:59,710
Simple...

383
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,710
Prototype...

384
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,570
Of the new Minto plushie.

385
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,550
So...

386
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,750
I will be able to show you guys...

387
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:07,990
Soon...

388
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,210
Once it comes...

389
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:09,870
All...

390
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,450
Of...

391
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,430
My little adventures with her.

392
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:13,630
And...

393
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,070
Then you'll kind of...

394
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,190
Be like, wow...

395
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,010
She's such a marketable plushie.

396
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,350
I must have it.

397
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,070
And...

398
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,710
You will then also soon hopefully have her.

399
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,350
And...

400
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,490
Go on your own Minto adventures.

401
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,670
Yay!

402
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,690
You're going to actually pass...

403
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,690
On when someone brings the daki to a car.

404
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,390
Don't say...

405
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,110
Don't say...

406
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,010
Don't say that.

407
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,490
Don't say that.

408
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,590
Oh my god.

409
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,650
But...

410
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,430
Yeah.

411
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,350
So...

412
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,530
Yeah.

413
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,110
It's marketable.

414
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:54,650
So...

415
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,790
I'll be taking her...

416
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,770
I'll be posting lots of pictures...

417
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,550
With the plushie...

418
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,890
In lots of places...

419
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,870
So you can be like...

420
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,250
Wow...

421
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,810
I must have my own...

422
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,690
And then you can also see what...

423
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,530
The size is like...

424
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,550
And stuff like that.

425
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,370
So...

426
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,130
Is there a hole in the bottom of the plush?

427
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,110
No!

428
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,030
I don't know which one is...

429
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,930
Which number...

430
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,810
This one!

431
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,710
There is no hole...

432
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,370
There is no hole in the bottom of the plushie.

433
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,780
There is no hole in the bottom of the plushie.

434
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,700
You can make one with that knife!

435
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,340
Stop!

436
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,620
But yeah, thank you Fishman for helping me out.

437
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,560
And I got to hang out a bit with the FaZe girls.

438
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,040
They've been very nice, very sweet.

439
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,820
So yeah, it's been fun.

440
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,260
What else have I done?

441
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,280
I did go to Akihabara once.

442
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,920
And he made fun of the fact that I wanted to go to Moss Burger.

443
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,520
He's kind of an asshole.

444
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,890
Could I hand you an apple?

445
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,410
Sure.

446
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,110
Shocker.

447
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,850
The FaZe girls love to bully him.

448
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,430
Yeah.

449
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,830
I think I've been putting... I've been collecting witness statements.

450
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,910
Or I'm the witness.

451
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:56,610
Of his... of him towards... like how he acts towards them.

452
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,210
And I'm like...

453
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,670
Wait, which one is my notes taking?

454
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,510
Nope.

455
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,870
Yes.

456
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,530
I've been like...

457
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:05,610
Okay.

458
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,850
I see.

459
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,130
I see.

460
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,170
This is how he acts towards them.

461
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,250
I see.

462
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:11,610
I see.

463
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,890
Spill the beans.

464
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,770
Has he asked you to dress as Marin Sancho yet?

465
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,550
No, but he has brought up Marin several times.

466
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,210
And of course, this is what it is...

467
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:34,550
Who did you meet from FaZe?

468
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,410
I'm a...

469
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,030
Well, I'm a...

470
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,310
Oh...

471
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,690
I know.

472
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,850
I met Leah.

473
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,070
I always used to call her Leah.

474
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,210
I met Ruka.

475
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,390
I met Pippa.

476
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,830
I...

477
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,830
I think I saw Clara for like two seconds.

478
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,170
Maybe.

479
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,530
Maybe that was it.

480
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:56,990
This is an illusion.

481
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,250
Or a dream.

482
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,550
Not much has happened because I don't have any money.

483
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,970
And also because I've been doing events.

484
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,330
One day for EXPO.

485
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,750
So basically I woke up at...

486
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,890
I woke up at 1 a.m.

487
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:27,510
for the concert.

488
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,230
So I got the times wrong.

489
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,710
I thought that my meet and greet was the day before.

490
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,970
And so I went to sleep at 4 p.m.

491
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,350
Woke up at like 8 p.m.

492
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,950
Because I thought my meet and greet was at 9.

493
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,290
And then I was like, oh, my meet and greet is actually tomorrow.

494
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,610
So I went back to sleep and I woke up at 1 a.m.

495
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,310
And then I did the concert.

496
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,910
For VEXPO.

497
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,550
And I was so excited afterwards.

498
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,410
It was like...

499
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,050
It was around like 4 p.m.

500
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,830
Because it started at 3 p.m.

501
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,830
It was around like 4 a.m.

502
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,030
And I was like, I can't sleep.

503
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,510
I'm too excited after...

504
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,390
Oh, I have a screenshot.

505
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,930
Of people in the crowd.

506
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,370
Hold on.

507
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,390
I took a screenshot.

508
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,070
Look at you guys.

509
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,010
It's kind of blurry.

510
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,190
But this is...

511
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,710
I was like...

512
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,890
Oops, sorry.

513
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,710
That was kind of loud.

514
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,610
I was like...

515
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:28,910
Look at everybody.

516
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,290
So much green.

517
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:33,730
I know.

518
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:34,130
I know.

519
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,830
And so...

520
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,190
It was around 4 a.m.

521
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,930
And I was like, I can't sleep.

522
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,490
I'm too excited.

523
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,450
And so I stayed up.

524
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,570
Actually...

525
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,730
And then I went out that day.

526
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,450
Just like walking around.

527
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:52,970
And then...

528
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,590
And then my meet and greets.

529
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,630
First I did the iPad walk around.

530
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,070
That was at like 9 p.m.

531
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,390
And then I did...

532
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,230
Meet and greets for real.

533
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,790
And that was at 11 p.m.

534
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,010
And by the time I was done.

535
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,070
It was 1 a.m.

536
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,830
And I was like...

537
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,510
I've been awake 24 hours, baby.

538
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,990
And I can keep going.

539
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,110
And then I seen that there was that guy.

540
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,430
That's been like trying to stay awake for like 4 hours.

541
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,890
Like, I don't know how many hours it is.

542
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,570
I was like, I could beat him.

543
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,490
I think.

544
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,910
I think if I did meet and greets the entire time, I could beat him because...

545
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,830
Because just seeing you guys fills me with so much energy.

546
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,750
Please don't.

547
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,670
11 days?

548
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:42,810
Okay, never mind.

549
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,470
Never mind.

550
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,230
I don't like you guys that much.

551
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:48,810
No, I'm just kidding.

552
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:51,850
He's at 11.

553
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,030
The guy is literally gonna like permanently damage his brain.

554
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:02,210
Oh yeah, we were also having some technical difficulties before the concert.

555
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,530
Look at this cursed picture of me.

556
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,770
There were even more cursed ones, but this is the only screenshot I got.

557
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,150
It was so cursed.

558
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,910
I look like the grudge is happening.

559
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,390
Spooky.

560
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,230
That was haunting.

561
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,890
The stage, you know, a little bit.

562
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,590
Oh, and then of course for if you are at.

563
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,370
Any arrival.

564
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,950
I do really really really want to apologize.

565
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,790
I think Doki kind of brought it up a little bit, but basically.

566
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:45,670
To to make things as easy for me and also as What's the word?

567
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,150
I guess assurance the quality assurance.

568
00:28:50,430 --> 00:29:18,870
I guess I brought my whole set up like it's a laptop, but I brought like my whole Yamaha AGO 8 which if you don't know is quite big I brought like an external keyboard I brought everything like so that I could you know one be comfortable with my setup and also make sure that the meet and greets went well.

569
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,010
The concerts went well.

570
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,550
Because I it was not my intention to be traveling during those events.

571
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:31,870
So I wanted to I you know, I wanted to make sure that everything would go smoothly.

572
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:41,430
But then for any rival basically when we were doing soundcheck like they said things sounded a little bit weird.

573
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:51,470
But then eventually they said that it sounded okay and they were the kind of just like oh just turn your Oh, I just realized something.

574
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:51,870
Hold on.

575
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,830
Sorry, I'm going to pause the music real quick.

576
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,110
Because I'm changing some sound settings.

577
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,890
They basically said like that means the problem was on their end.

578
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:05,610
No, no, no.

579
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:12,770
I think they didn't understand and I also didn't understand how they were saying like what the problem was.

580
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,150
Basically.

581
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,950
They said that it was noise cancelling.

582
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,390
But I was like, I don't have.

583
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,230
I don't have like a noise.

584
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,790
Gate or anything on this mixer.

585
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:27,570
So there was nothing for me to turn off and it literally was just one single button.

586
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,870
I wonder if I press it now.

587
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:38,410
I don't want to like it to pop and hurt your ears or anything, you know, but it was just a single button that I did not realize.

588
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,490
And so do it really?

589
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,610
Okay, I'm going to press it.

590
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,570
I'll turn your here.

591
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,550
I'll turn the mic down.

592
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:56,870
I'll turn the mic down so that hello.

593
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,800
This is what this is what I sounded like.

594
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,680
And so it did that to the music as well.

595
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,500
And they were like turn your music down turn your music up and I was doing everything.

596
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,840
Even mid song.

597
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,540
They were like, you know, they were like messaging me being like your music is is getting filtered.

598
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,520
You try adjusting the settings.

599
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:39,400
And so I was like a little stressed like trying to adjust settings while mid song and I was like, I don't know what to do.

600
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,320
And I just felt, you know, I feel so awful because you know, Doki invited me to her event.

601
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,400
And you know, it was my first time working with any rival staff and everything.

602
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:58,020
And I just felt so I just felt so so so bad.

603
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,760
I'm really sorry if you are at the concert and I know some people are just like don't worry about it.

604
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:12,680
But for everybody at the concert, you know, I'm really really sorry that I was not prepared enough and and didn't

605
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:28,400
I wasn't prepared enough to fix it.

606
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:30,960
I'm really sorry.

607
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,660
But because of that Doki and I are cooking.

608
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,400
We're kind of cooking you guys.

609
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,820
So maybe be on the lookout.

610
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,840
In the future for stuff that we're cooking revenge revenge time.

611
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,420
Why do we even have that button?

612
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,860
You know, every every mic has like their own different settings and stuff.

613
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:05,820
So it was just so that was so frustrated.

614
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,460
That was a learning experience.

615
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,740
Yes, for sure revengeance.

616
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,920
Yeah revengeance.

617
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,110
Yeah, so they're becoming chefs with this one.

618
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,890
From here on out.

619
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,790
I think things will start picking up pace a little bit.

620
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:45,430
Not that they but in terms of my projects and such so I'm very excited for all the things that got planned got going on.

621
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,390
Yeah,

622
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:02,870
especially once I'm back and once I'm back you guys, I think that'll be the end of the podcast.

623
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,510
Oh my gosh.

624
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:17,750
No, but while I'm here, I have plans for off collabs with several people that I hopefully hopefully it works out.

625
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:17,990
I'm here.

626
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,730
I know some people's schedules are kind of crazy.

627
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,410
Hopefully they work out.

628
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,850
Who with us?

629
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,190
Fall season fall season by Mata.

630
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,620
Will you say hi to Kiara?

631
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,300
It's actually so funny because you know how I said my AGO8 is huge.

632
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:48,020
Kiara mentioned that she was using an AGO8 on stream and I was like, hey girl, I have an extra one.

633
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:56,400
So essentially what happened is I ordered by AGO8, which if you don't know it's an interface like it's how I'm how you're able to hear me right now.

634
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,680
It's the Yamaha AGO8 and I really like it.

635
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:12,240
It's probably been my favorite of you know, I really like the effects the go XLR had but a lot of people are moving away from the go XLR because the company went out of business.

636
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,880
And so there's stopping like updates on it.

637
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,280
So I got I ended up getting this to try it out and I really like it.

638
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,940
And yeah, no support.

639
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:33,720
So Kiara mentioned that she liked it and I had ordered one and it got lost in the mail.

640
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,560
And so I told I told them I was like, hey Amazon my AGO8 got lost in the mail.

641
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,700
Send me a new one.

642
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,420
And so they did and then the original one came back.

643
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,880
And I was like, and

644
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:13,980
and so I also brought the entire other one here with me to Japan for Kiara because I love her so much that I didn't mind carrying three suitcases just for her.

645
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,940
Any thoughts on a collab with Michi?

646
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,560
No pressure.

647
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,220
Just wait to come.

648
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,440
Yoshi's is my dream.

649
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:24,980
Like cute.

650
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,880
What funny and dumb.

651
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,320
What are you talking about?

652
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,720
I would love to collab with Michi.

653
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,460
I think right now she is on a hiatus though, right?

654
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,360
So maybe when she comes back.

655
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,560
Did you see that Jerma collab with Kiara?

656
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,380
Yes.

657
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,560
I saw the EDF.

658
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,240
I saw a clips of it actually.

659
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,380
Yeah.

660
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,740
She is healthifying herself.

661
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,140
Good because she needs it.

662
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,680
I hope that she...

663
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,460
I hope I hope that she recovers well.

664
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,980
Neurosama collab maybe?

665
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,060
Actually, I really want to collab with Neurosama.

666
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:17,220
It's funny you mention that because I was like, I was I was thinking probably once I get back I'll shoot Vito a message and say hey, can I collab with Neurosama?

667
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:25,380
But I kind of want to do like, not just like a talking like I want to do something something.

668
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,440
So,

669
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,830
mental cooking.

670
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,180
Her cover a wink.

671
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,460
I don't think I saw it.

672
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,760
Oh, I saw someone mention also.

673
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:56,300
Like maybe I was thinking like don't be like if it's possible like a like a what's it called?

674
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:08,620
No talking or some people explode because I would love to see how Neuro if it's possible, how she would describe some of the the ways to disarm the ball.

675
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,500
Oh, the keep talking.

676
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:12,960
Yeah.

677
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,920
Yeah, the bomb game.

678
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,980
She's played it before.

679
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,740
Oh, she has a couple of streams.

680
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,200
Okay.

681
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,420
So yeah, then it might work out.

682
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,320
That's like the V to begin.

683
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,800
I have like long long time ago.

684
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:46,540
I did a collab of that with a friend and she had like tech issues the whole time.

685
00:38:48,240 --> 00:39:01,540
And so it made it very funny because she would be just be delayed or her audio would just give out and I was just like, what are you saying?

686
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,540
So I have good memories with the game.

687
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
See her roast you.

688
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,680
I can take it.

689
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,380
You know me.

690
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,520
She also likes trolling beetle to make him explode.

691
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,360
I like what?

692
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:35,820
Yeah, like I like I don't catch her streams so often because I'm not on Twitch, but I a lot of people upload like longer clips of her and I like the clips will be like I say it's a clip but it's like 30 minutes long and I just I just watch the entire thing.

693
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,540
It's just she's just so funny.

694
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,740
It's so funny.

695
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:50,220
I wonder like if I had created her if I you know, like I would feel like she's my actual daughter.

696
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,320
I would feel so attached to her.

697
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,640
You know, I would be like this is my literal baby.

698
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,160
She's I don't know.

699
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,200
She's just got this.

700
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,620
This charm.

701
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,900
I just love it so much.

702
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,180
Baby Minto.

703
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,740
No, she's the baby.

704
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,340
Beetle does seem like a dad.

705
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,140
Why did I take you for the 50 gifted?

706
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,520
Thank you so much.

707
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,280
Thank you.

708
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,200
Thank you.

709
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:23,620
Thank you.

710
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,760
Oh, you have a charm that we love.

711
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,300
So much.

712
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:28,940
Stop.

713
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,200
Baby.

714
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,080
You're always looking for a psychiatrist.

715
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,580
At the airport.

716
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,840
Sorry.

717
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,460
I was just thinking of my how I mentioned that I brought like the whole box for for Kiara.

718
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,880
I also brought two more months worth of postcards.

719
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,220
Okay.

720
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,500
So to give you an idea.

721
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,300
I brought a full-size suitcase.

722
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:00,740
Right?

723
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,980
I had I had and in just just the suitcase.

724
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:22,400
I had the ag08 box for Kiara and then I had the postcards for Mata and just and that nothing else just those two things in a whole suitcase and just those two things alone almost brought me to the weight limit.

725
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,350
Kunari.

726
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,650
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

727
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,330
Thank you.

728
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:39,290
Yeah, so and then when I went through security, I put all my streaming stuff.

729
00:41:39,450 --> 00:42:01,130
I was like if anything like if anything happens to my suitcases, I will go without clothes for a couple days, but I must have all of my every single streaming thing in my carry-on because Because the events are the most important, right?

730
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:03,590
Wow.

731
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,310
Oh my gosh, good playlist.

732
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,510
Thank you for the 50 gifts.

733
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,570
Thank you so much.

734
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:07,870
You guys.

735
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:08,390
Thank you.

736
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:08,610
Thank you.

737
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:08,850
Thank you.

738
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,010
But when I went through security, this has never happened to me before.

739
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,270
They got mad at me.

740
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:21,870
The lady was just like you have too many electronics in your bag.

741
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,110
She got mad.

742
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,050
I was like, sorry, lady.

743
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:43,910
I'm And so I had packed everything very meticulously to kind of like make sure that my my second monitor didn't get damaged to make sure my phone was okay.

744
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,570
My laptop was okay.

745
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:46,590
My keyboard was okay.

746
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:50,850
And then she just started tearing it out and throwing it into bins.

747
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:57,230
I was like, and so it took me to like a I was like you bitch.

748
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,010
So angry.

749
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,550
You traveled with the second monitor.

750
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,250
Yes.

751
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:18,910
I'm telling you one of the reasons I don't like streaming when I am when I'm away is because I feel so uncomfortable, you know, I was like, I hate using laptop keyboard.

752
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:22,070
I hate not having my normal interface.

753
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:25,610
I hate not having two screens.

754
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:36,830
And so yeah, I brought pretty much everything so that I would feel most comfortable so that I could stream the most since I'm not home.

755
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,250
The Patriots made her do it.

756
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,450
We record thanks to the five gifted.

757
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,410
Thank you.

758
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:48,750
And I didn't want to not Oh my God.

759
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,070
I just said that girl.

760
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,290
Your concert of Expo is amazing.

761
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,970
I love your version of you can avoid the lines.

762
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:55,350
Absolutely.

763
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,490
Love doing what they get with you.

764
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:57,990
Thank you for the iPad.

765
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:58,370
Be great.

766
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,030
You're the best.

767
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,070
Oh, she ever be don't love.

768
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,950
Thank you.

769
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:02,910
Thank you.

770
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,270
Thank you.

771
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:03,670
Thank you.

772
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:04,590
Say it.

773
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,530
Imagine a timeline where your clothes luggage was sacrificed.

774
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:14,650
So you're doing all these content stuff and being they don't know.

775
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,190
I'm closed.

776
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:20,370
Let's window traveling to suitcases for tech.

777
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,150
No clothes.

778
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:21,730
No wallet.

779
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,430
It's three suitcases actually.

780
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:36,810
Yeah, I was really happy to I know a lot of people didn't get the meet-and-greet at the expo.

781
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:44,010
So I was like if I can go around on the iPad and meet as many people as I could there.

782
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:56,110
I feel like also I perform a lot of the same songs at concerts, but I try to do the same songs at different.

783
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:02,630
So for example, you know, that was my first time performing in Europe.

784
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:18,370
So I was like I should you know, do these songs that I think are really fun to do with the gate to because you know, for me, it's me performing it for the hundredth time, but for these, you know, for these guys, it might be their first time hearing it.

785
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:22,650
So that's what kind of but I feel bad.

786
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:25,590
I'm like, I have no I feel like I have no variety.

787
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:31,670
I'd rather not.

788
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:34,210
Thanks for the five gifted hermocrates.

789
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,150
Thank you for the vibe.

790
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,110
Good to take you.

791
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,050
Hello from Canada.

792
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,150
So yeah, any revival last weekend.

793
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:45,550
The with croaky will be remembered for years.

794
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:55,350
I felt so uncomfortable about the fact not being able to play games on my actual PC during off-time.

795
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,770
So just the Steve that I know right when you're not in.

796
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:58,430
You're like comfortable.

797
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,370
And you're not in your comfortable place.

798
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,230
It's weird, right?

799
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:04,690
Minty sweat.

800
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:06,150
Baintoe.

801
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:06,890
Yeah.

802
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:12,310
Or four or four or four or four or four or four.

803
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,910
My comfort zone.

804
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:17,690
Can't any new maid cafes?

805
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,110
No, because I have no money.

806
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,290
I have no money.

807
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:25,690
He.

808
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:25,950
He.

809
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:26,250
He.

810
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:26,510
He.

811
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:44,110
I have like luckily I have I have my iPhone like the iPhone that I use for streaming that I have my Suica card on.

812
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,950
So a lot of places do take Suica tap.

813
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,450
So I've been paying with that as well.

814
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,150
And I have my cards on my phone.

815
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,310
So places that take tap.

816
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:55,750
I'll do that too.

817
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:56,990
But not every places.

818
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:00,070
Maid cafes are like all cash.

819
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,070
Not everyone, but a lot of them are cash.

820
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:10,210
So, yeah, I just, you know, hopefully it comes soon.

821
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,450
Especially I hope because I have a hair appointment on Friday.

822
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,990
Thanks for coming to the expo.

823
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,630
Crashing the Wisp meetup.

824
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,010
Your performance at the concert was amazing.

825
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,150
Here's my meet and greet feed.

826
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:25,990
And the postage stamp for the personal message to the Buggley.

827
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:27,910
Eww.

828
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:28,370
Palazzo.

829
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,470
Gosh, that's a throw back.

830
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,830
Does anyone remember XL Saga?

831
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,630
Do you have any plans on collabing with some ultra-violent guard dogs?

832
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:38,970
Minto.

833
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:40,850
lol Um.

834
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:42,410
Uh.

835
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:44,770
Uh.

836
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,630
I would love to.

837
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:51,630
I believe that their schedule is a little busy right now.

838
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:53,090
So.

839
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:54,810
Um.

840
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:56,210
But...

841
00:47:56,210 --> 00:48:01,930
I love them so much.

842
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,690
Their 3D was so awesome.

843
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,270
So, so awesome.

844
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,290
Don't hurt to ask.

845
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,850
Oh, why do you think I haven't asked?

846
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,960
Extreme violence.

847
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,780
Bow?

848
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,800
Bow-bow!

849
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:21,800
Wow!

850
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,180
I'm in 3D, when?

851
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:33,600
Yeah, you know, I get so motivated by stuff like that.

852
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:39,760
I'm just like, I hope I can get 3D soon and I hope I can do really cool things too.

853
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,680
It's so fun.

854
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,560
I love seeing people being creative and fun.

855
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:49,560
Because it makes me want to also be creative and fun and do things.

856
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,680
So, you know.

857
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,680
Right now, I'm in cooking.

858
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:51,900
Cooking mode.

859
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,280
But...

860
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,060
Eventually, hopefully.

861
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,820
Hopefully, eventually.

862
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,400
Right?

863
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,840
Vexpo Celeb is awesome!

864
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,820
Perfect for my first time doing Otakeyara live event because I used those songs to prepare.

865
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,000
Let's go, Ken-chan!

866
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,440
Wait, you literally told me last time, last event.

867
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,000
You were just like, yeah, I think I'm gonna go to Vexpo.

868
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,780
And you actually win.

869
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,740
You're so crazy.

870
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,060
Oh my god.

871
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,660
You're creative and fun.

872
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,540
I love seeing you.

873
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,960
Thanks a lot!

874
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,360
Oh, your cooking has been worth the wait?

875
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,000
I think you're more impatient than us.

876
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,180
Maybe.

877
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:36,660
Maybe.

878
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,800
I just don't feel like I'm ever doing enough.

879
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,680
I think I saw that's like an anxiety thing though.

880
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,980
When you are working but you feel like you're not working hard enough.

881
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,340
Your new catchphrase should be, do you want to fight it out or freak it out?

882
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,440
What the fuck?

883
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,340
Thank you so much for coming to our Mito Mito!

884
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:05,880
Thank you!

885
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,900
Now I'm so happy to meet so many new people.

886
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,140
I really hope you get your wallet soon so you can have fun in Japan.

887
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,520
Really glad that I got to meet you at Otaku time.

888
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,680
Thanks Merlin!

889
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,840
Just like grandma.

890
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,320
How do you know?

891
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,080
I didn't know my grandma.

892
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,980
Actually I haven't...

893
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,500
It just reminded me my mom called me to text her back.

894
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,880
My mom doesn't know I'm in Japan and I'm afraid to tell her because...

895
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,540
I know she's going to freak out about the mega earthquake.

896
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,980
She's going to freak out about the mega quake.

897
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,380
She's going to be like...

898
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,440
Mom, I'm home right now!

899
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,260
If you guys...

900
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,100
She doesn't know.

901
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,600
She thinks I'm still in California.

902
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:01,680
I was like...

903
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,460
Mom, I haven't been in California for a while now.

904
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,440
Did you feel the earthquake?

905
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,640
I felt...

906
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,700
There was like a...

907
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,280
I keep wanting to say level five.

908
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,900
What's the proper term?

909
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,580
A five quake.

910
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,060
A couple days ago.

911
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:25,600
Magnitude?

912
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,380
Yeah, magnitude.

913
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,660
Magnitude five.

914
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,040
The other day.

915
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,380
But I didn't feel it very much.

916
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,180
Like I felt it.

917
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,460
But it was very fast.

918
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,260
Yeah.

919
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,220
It was very fast though.

920
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,080
I didn't...

921
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:41,860
It wasn't so bad.

922
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:42,860
I don't know.

923
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:44,860
I don't know.

924
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,380
I don't know.

925
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:46,780
I don't know.

926
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:46,800
I don't know.

927
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:46,940
I don't know.

928
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,460
I don't know.

929
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,000
I'm glad you're fine.

930
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:50,780
Yeah, hopefully.

931
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:51,860
Hopefully, it's okay.

932
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,980
They all say...

933
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,840
The big one's coming to you.

934
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:57,420
You know?

935
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,460
But...

936
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,460
Other than that one...

937
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,320
It's been...

938
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,080
It's been quiet.

939
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,540
Knock on wood.

940
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,380
Knock on wood.

941
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,280
And it's so weird because like...

942
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,480
Sometimes I...

943
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,140
I think I like...

944
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,060
Gaslight myself.

945
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:25,220
Like...

946
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,660
I feel myself into thinking there's an earthquake.

947
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,840
I don't know if it's like...

948
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,480
A me...

949
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,920
Feeling something that's not there.

950
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:32,840
Or...

951
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,140
Like a...

952
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,600
Like sometimes I'll lay down and I'll be like...

953
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,940
Did my bed just shake?

954
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,760
Maybe it's a ghost.

955
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,440
I don't know.

956
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,920
It could be a ghost.

957
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:42,520
Okay.

958
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,720
Here's some possible explanations.

959
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:44,820
One.

960
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,420
Ghost.

961
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,340
Two.

962
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,420
Earthquake.

963
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,560
My tummy.

964
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,020
Three.

965
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:51,800
Tummy.

966
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,060
Four.

967
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,020
Tummy.

968
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:55,200
Tummy.

969
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,560
What's a...

970
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,620
What's that thing when you get dizzy?

971
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:07,330
What's a thing when you get...

972
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:08,370
Vertical.

973
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,650
Yeah.

974
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:08,890
Yeah.

975
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:09,450
Vertical.

976
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:12,490
I can't tell.

977
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,870
I'll just be laying in bed and I'm just like, huh.

978
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:20,870
But it's also because like...

979
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:21,430
You know.

980
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:22,010
It's...

981
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:22,390
Oh.

982
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,970
There is a one distinct feeling I remember.

983
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:26,570
I remember.

984
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:41,030
I remember one time I went to the beach as a kid, and after the beach, you know, you're playing in the water, you're like, woohoo, I'm splashing around, I'm being a kid in the water, you know?

985
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:46,310
And then you go home that night and you lay down.

986
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:51,650
I remember this distinct feeling because I was just like, how is this possible?

987
00:53:51,650 --> 00:54:00,750
And then, when you're lying down, you feel yourself like... in the... you feel like you're still in the waves.

988
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,630
I think that might be kind of what I feel.

989
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:05,130
I'm back!

990
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,250
I'm back!

991
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,830
How's the sound and the everything, by the way?

992
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:13,950
I forgot to ask.

993
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,090
If, like, the connection is good and everything.

994
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:21,630
Just finished up a big project at work and catching up with your VODs have helped me a lot.

995
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:22,750
I need to restore my sanity this week.

996
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:23,770
Oh, I don't know!

997
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:24,850
Congrats!

998
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,630
Love the Metal Gear podcast yesterday.

999
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,650
It's so cool to see how much passion you have towards MGS.

1000
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:37,950
I hope one day I'll be able to see how you feel about my franchise, too, once you've finished it.

1001
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:43,030
A bit muffled compared to usual stream.

1002
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:43,410
Really?

1003
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:47,330
Maybe it's because I'm not... is this better?

1004
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,610
I don't think I was, like, talking into the mic.

1005
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,610
My mic is, like...

1006
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:52,310
this direction.

1007
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,990
But it's also a different mic, so...

1008
00:54:57,850 --> 00:54:58,950
Oh, it's louder.

1009
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:04,030
That's nice.

1010
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:08,510
I actually thought... so I do kind of have, like, a little bit of a schedule this week.

1011
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:16,770
So tomorrow, I'm gonna do Typing of the Dead.

1012
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:21,870
And then I thought maybe I was just like, well, if I'm... here?

1013
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,410
Um, I can't do, like, the bi...

1014
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:26,550
bi...

1015
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:27,730
bi...

1016
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:28,470
bi...

1017
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:28,770
bi...

1018
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:28,830
bi...

1019
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:32,570
I can't do the bi... ears.

1020
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:33,950
What's it called?

1021
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:34,910
The bi...

1022
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:36,550
It's clearer now.

1023
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,330
Okay, I'll move my mic a little bit.

1024
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:39,370
I'll have to adjust it then.

1025
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:40,770
The bi...

1026
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:42,170
bi...

1027
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:43,750
neural...

1028
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:44,310
bi...

1029
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,170
aural...

1030
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:46,410
bi... aural...

1031
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,470
Typing of the Dad, yeah.

1032
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:48,970
.

1033
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,010
The bi...

1034
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:52,470
neural...

1035
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:52,970
bi...

1036
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:53,710
aural...

1037
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:54,490
bi...

1038
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:55,630
aural...

1039
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:56,230
bi...

1040
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:04,810
Why is that word so hard to say?

1041
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:05,610
Oh my gosh.

1042
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:07,190
I sound like I'm peaking.

1043
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:08,290
Am I peaking?

1044
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:12,570
Hold on.

1045
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:22,080
Beep boop bop, beep boop bop, beep boop bop, beep boop bop, beep boop bop, beep boop bop.

1046
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,180
Yeah!

1047
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:23,640
Ah.

1048
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,780
Maybe that's okay.

1049
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:31,010
?

1050
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,880
I don't know.

1051
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,880
I don't have anything for ASMR.

1052
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:55,920
.

1053
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,400
I was thinking, I was trying to brainstorm something to do.

1054
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,080
Mmm... crisp.

1055
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,340
We don't need ASMR?

1056
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,080
Well then you don't have to watch.

1057
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,040
Some people like things that you don't like.

1058
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,140
And that's okay.

1059
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:31,200
If you don't like ASMR, I know a lot of people will be like, Oh I hate ASMR, why are you doing that?

1060
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,280
I'm not going to become an ASMR streamer, don't get me wrong.

1061
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,260
But...

1062
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,760
But, you know.

1063
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:43,800
I think sometimes it's kind of fun to experiment with different things.

1064
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,020
You know?

1065
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,390
I'm a variety streamer.

1066
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,930
Just ASMR us some MGS Codex.

1067
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:57,630
Pring, pring.

1068
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:58,850
Hey.

1069
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,130
You're pretty good.

1070
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:04,010
Tchew.

1071
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:06,970
Read us MGS lore.

1072
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:12,670
But I probably will do it when it's night time in Japan.

1073
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:16,430
So it might be morning for a lot of you guys.

1074
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,910
Because I have to get into the mood.

1075
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:23,310
I have to get into like the... you know.

1076
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,530
Oh my god, I just looked over at my...

1077
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:29,790
I don't know if you guys saw my tweet.

1078
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:33,150
About how there was a child staring into my room.

1079
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,550
From the other hotel room.

1080
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,790
And I just looked over and their blinds are up.

1081
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,390
Okay, I'm lowering my blinds.

1082
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:40,690
Hold on.

1083
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:44,050
I don't want them to see me.

1084
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:47,350
No, I'm lowering my blinds.

1085
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,010
Hold on.

1086
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,070
You almost just lost me there.

1087
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,450
Oh my god, you almost just lost.

1088
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:11,370
Okay.

1089
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:17,050
My...

1090
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:17,570
My...

1091
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:20,030
My webcam almost just fell.

1092
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:25,990
Are you sure it was a child?

1093
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:26,490
Oh yeah.

1094
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:27,710
I know.

1095
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:28,010
Yeah.

1096
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:29,210
I'm 100%.

1097
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,070
I saw him.

1098
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,950
I saw his eyes wide.

1099
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:33,110
Clear.

1100
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,090
It was night time.

1101
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,790
But it was clear as day.

1102
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,590
I was like...

1103
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:39,570
I was like...

1104
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:44,290
Yeah.

1105
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:45,130
Once I...

1106
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:45,950
Once I...

1107
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,670
Once I'm out of this hotel, I will show you guys.

1108
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:49,790
And you'll be like...

1109
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:52,110
First of all, you'll be like...

1110
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:52,750
Holy cow.

1111
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:54,810
Why was...

1112
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:55,290
Why?

1113
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,390
Why are the rooms like this?

1114
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:03,150
That child hasn't moved from there since yesterday.

1115
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:05,690
It's...

1116
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:07,030
So bizarre.

1117
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,010
It's so strange.

1118
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:15,310
Japan is freaky.

1119
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,250
No, clearly.

1120
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:18,730
I'm having a hard time picturing it.

1121
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:18,990
Yeah.

1122
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,550
Once...

1123
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,150
Once I...

1124
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:24,270
Once I am gone and can show you guys a picture, you'll be like...

1125
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:26,150
She wasn't kidding.

1126
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,910
Because I think some people are probably like, there's no way this is possible.

1127
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:31,910
No, no, no, no.

1128
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,230
It's very possible.

1129
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:37,890
I was so glad I was able to meet you.

1130
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:38,430
I don't talk a lot.

1131
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,710
I was so nervous, I didn't even introduce myself.

1132
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,790
I was wearing the Bill fan.

1133
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:45,470
And you signed my MGS shirt!

1134
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:46,090
Yes!

1135
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:47,790
I'm gonna cherish it forever.

1136
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:48,650
Thank you Zozo!

1137
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,770
Thank you for coming to see me.

1138
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,350
I always wonder, like...

1139
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:56,830
I'm always just like, I wonder...

1140
01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:00,410
How many people are actually gonna see me at some of these events?

1141
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:01,890
Like...

1142
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:05,390
You know, like I said, I'm doing the concert in Malaysia and I'm just like...

1143
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:06,630
Do I...

1144
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,310
Like, do I have any fans in Malaysia?

1145
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:10,590
I don't know, you know?

1146
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:12,010
So...

1147
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:17,730
A kid died in that room 12 years ago.

1148
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:18,930
What you saw was a ghost.

1149
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:22,670
Why am I laughing at it?

1150
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:26,370
No, I think it was a human child.

1151
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,070
It makes it even scarier.

1152
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:31,170
Ghost.

1153
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:40,850
I'm sure you have fans in all corners of the world.

1154
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,030
I have fans?

1155
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:57,910
Been lots of events.

1156
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:01,190
I think next up is...

1157
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:03,950
The concert at ANYC.

1158
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:06,790
Is anybody going to New York, New York?

1159
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,910
Actually, is it in New York, New York?

1160
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:10,410
I don't know.

1161
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:13,350
The room for the podcast at Otakuton was insane.

1162
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:14,110
That is...

1163
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,530
There were so many people, yeah.

1164
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:17,270
There were a lot of people.

1165
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:20,330
Whist from Malaysia here.

1166
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:21,570
Thank you!

1167
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:27,090
New York, New York.

1168
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,000
Looking forward to the ANYC concert.

1169
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:34,680
Me too!

1170
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,500
Oh my gosh, I'm so super duper excited.

1171
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:43,400
We love our worldwide fans.

1172
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,320
It's so funny because...

1173
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,420
What was it?

1174
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,100
Oh my gosh!

1175
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:50,480
Judy!

1176
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,300
Thank you for the 50!

1177
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,200
Holy cow!

1178
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,020
Thank you for the 50!

1179
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:54,560
Give it up to...

1180
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,080
Fan for Poland here.

1181
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:57,540
Thank you!

1182
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,280
Thank you so much!

1183
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,380
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1184
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:05,480
What was I going to say?

1185
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,560
The same day that I asked...

1186
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,960
I mistyped world.

1187
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,380
I was supposed to type a worldwide Minto.

1188
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,720
And instead, I tweeted out worldwide Minto.

1189
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:32,530
But the same day, I saw like some tweet.

1190
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:35,870
It was just a random like thing that showed up in my For You page, you know.

1191
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,430
And it was some girl that was just like...

1192
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:43,930
If you're above 20 years old and not married, what are you doing?

1193
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:46,970
And I wanted to quote retweet it and be like...

1194
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:48,030
World.

1195
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,770
Wife.

1196
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:49,270
Minto.

1197
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:55,250
I got married today.

1198
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,830
I don't know how many people...

1199
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,050
But I also was just like...

1200
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:05,690
Well, you know what?

1201
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:09,150
Maybe I should get married before the mega quake.

1202
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:12,430
This works!

1203
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:15,390
It all works.

1204
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:17,710
You're forever seven...

1205
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:18,370
Forever 19.

1206
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:19,650
Sorry, I almost said forever...

1207
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,630
I said forever 17...

1208
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:22,750
Out of...

1209
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:23,710
Out of reflex.

1210
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:26,730
Yeah, I am forever 19.

1211
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:31,130
My time has arrived to get married.

1212
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:32,990
Should we have a ceremony?

1213
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:35,210
Who would we...

1214
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:37,030
Who would be our...

1215
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:37,810
The officiant?

1216
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,040
Um...

1217
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,740
Who would marry us?

1218
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,340
World wife, Minto, and typing of the dad.

1219
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:51,160
Never change me.

1220
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:54,740
David Hader.

1221
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,160
Doki?

1222
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:56,100
No!

1223
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,420
Oymo can officiate.

1224
01:04:59,440 --> 01:04:59,980
It's only fair.

1225
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,620
I will let her if she lets me.

1226
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,120
At her wedding.

1227
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:06,660
Oymo, you hear that?

1228
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,640
Let me be the officiant.

1229
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,480
The person at your wedding.

1230
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,000
Wifey time.

1231
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:23,420
Having David Hader would be amazing, though.

1232
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,180
But then...

1233
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:28,280
If he's like, does anyone object?

1234
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,460
I'd be like...

1235
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,800
I would just close my eyes and I'd be like, me.

1236
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:33,500
Because...

1237
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,200
I object.

1238
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:36,720
Because I...

1239
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,740
How could I let Snake...

1240
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:39,780
You know?

1241
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,860
If Snake was...

1242
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:41,920
I would...

1243
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,000
I would just...

1244
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,820
I would be like...

1245
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:44,020
No!

1246
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,920
I'd close my eyes and I'd be like, the man of my dreams is right in front of me.

1247
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,780
Have Ayami-sensei be our mother?

1248
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,000
Ayami...

1249
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,180
Ayami-sensei!

1250
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,440
I can't tell if we're getting married or if she's marrying other people.

1251
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:03,400
Or...

1252
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,440
Or what's going on?

1253
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:10,100
Snake is right there.

1254
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,240
Please switch places.

1255
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:11,440
Please...

1256
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,900
She's the real world wife.

1257
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:24,250
All of her fans are her boyfriends.

1258
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:25,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1259
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:28,790
Where's the loyalty?

1260
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:33,410
She'll marry you.

1261
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:34,330
Yeah, you have to have a gun.

1262
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:34,990
But like...

1263
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:40,910
At Anime Fest, when she and I did a panel together, she was just like, do you have a gun?

1264
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:42,110
Okay.

1265
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:43,330
Let's get married.

1266
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:47,990
She's always accepting the marriage certificate.

1267
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:48,530
So...

1268
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:51,910
Sorry if you hear my coffee.

1269
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:04,650
Maya or Yua would walk you down the aisle.

1270
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:05,890
Yua, my papa.

1271
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,970
Yua, my papa.

1272
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:12,670
You're so true.

1273
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:13,350
You're so right.

1274
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:17,750
Coffee ASMR.

1275
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:18,210
Okay.

1276
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,750
Here, I'll turn off the music real quick.

1277
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:22,390
Koshichin-sama.

1278
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:23,250
Ojou-sama.

1279
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:24,970
Your tea is ready.

1280
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:31,410
See?

1281
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:32,390
I can do ASMR.

1282
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,320
Wait,

1283
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,450
she's a real maid?

1284
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,470
Shut up!

1285
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:50,670
Yes!

1286
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:51,930
I'm a real maid.

1287
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,690
What are you talking about?

1288
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:58,070
What time is it over there?

1289
01:07:58,190 --> 01:07:59,490
It's 10 a.m.

1290
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:01,610
10 a.m.

1291
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:05,510
I gotta get going in about 50 minutes.

1292
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:07,690
Sorry, it's a bit shorter today.

1293
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:10,290
We still have an hour, so don't leave.

1294
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:11,630
Don't leave.

1295
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:14,830
Don't leave.

1296
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:16,770
But...

1297
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:21,010
So, a.m.

1298
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:21,810
It's very p.m.

1299
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:22,210
over here.

1300
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:22,910
Yeah.

1301
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:24,770
But don't worry.

1302
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:31,610
I'll try and stream in the mornings as much, in mornings JST, as much as I can, so it kind of keeps with my schedule.

1303
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:32,970
My normal streaming schedule.

1304
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:34,910
Yeah.

1305
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,710
Did you get to see the maid cafe of Expo?

1306
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:37,710
All right, Janet!

1307
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:42,230
Which I'm so sad, because I've been a fan of Maids of England for a very long time.

1308
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:43,690
So...

1309
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:44,570
Oh, V!

1310
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,290
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

1311
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:47,490
Thank you!

1312
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,610
Thank you so much!

1313
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:54,890
Yeah.

1314
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:57,090
I want to collab with the maid cafe.

1315
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:00,170
I want to collab with the maid cafe.

1316
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:01,610
Six o'clock.

1317
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:02,190
11 p.m.

1318
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:02,370
here.

1319
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:03,830
Oh, it's perfect timing for you.

1320
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:07,630
PST gang rise!

1321
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:12,510
So, probably more streams will...

1322
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:18,830
I know it's like not my super normal streaming time, but probably most streams will start around the time that I started today.

1323
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,730
Maybe a little earlier sometimes.

1324
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:24,710
So, just if I have like other plans that day.

1325
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:31,610
I'll have to like start making plans pretty soon, since I do want to get started.

1326
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:32,350
So, I need to get schedules out.

1327
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:34,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1328
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,690
Ruin my sleep for Minto...

1329
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:39,070
NOOOOOO!!!

1330
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:46,930
Stop it.

1331
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:49,450
Stop it.

1332
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:54,160
When are you returning from Japan?

1333
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,860
Uh... in September.

1334
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:05,500
That's why I also wanted to be very comfortable with my streaming schedule, because I'm here for a... a while.

1335
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:07,720
So, uh...

1336
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:07,880
Yeah.

1337
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,800
Wake us up when September comes.

1338
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:15,700
When September?

1339
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,280
I don't know actually.

1340
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,640
It's great to meet you Otakutan.

1341
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,500
I hope you had a good time.

1342
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,260
Thanks Pao!

1343
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,460
I did.

1344
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:24,360
I had so much fun.

1345
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,000
Do I have any pictures from Otakutan?

1346
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:31,520
Don Daze, welcome to membership.

1347
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,040
Thank you!

1348
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:34,760
Let's see.

1349
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,840
What pictures do I have?

1350
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:44,120
I can't wait to show you guys how I've been streaming.

1351
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,570
Like my setup right now is so nice.

1352
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:02,190
Winter, welcome to membership, dark girl.

1353
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:04,890
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1354
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:07,630
Oh my gosh, let me show you guys.

1355
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:10,910
On my way home from Otakutan.

1356
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:12,410
Hold on.

1357
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:13,470
Not home.

1358
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:14,330
On the way home.

1359
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,670
On the way to the airport from Otakutan.

1360
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:17,470
Hold on.

1361
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:20,450
Where's the chat that I sent this in?

1362
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:22,810
Where's the chat?

1363
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:23,970
Oh here, here, here.

1364
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:25,530
I saw this guy.

1365
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:27,550
On the way there.

1366
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:28,230
Oh my god.

1367
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:29,370
On the way to the airport.

1368
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:30,370
I was like...

1369
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,370
Hold on.

1370
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,440
I was so excited.

1371
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,180
I had a group chat with Emuri and Mata.

1372
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:47,360
And I was like...

1373
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,280
Ready?

1374
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,040
Ta-da!

1375
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:03,160
Look at that!

1376
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:04,440
Look at that!

1377
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:07,580
There's him.

1378
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,440
Hold on, I got a better picture too.

1379
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:10,720
Ready?

1380
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,180
Ready?

1381
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,300
Ta-da!

1382
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,700
He looked directly at me!

1383
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,320
I was so excited.

1384
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,360
He looked directly at me.

1385
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:33,480
He looked directly at me.

1386
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:33,900
Oh wait...

1387
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,280
Hold on.

1388
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,040
This picture.

1389
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,300
Well, look at his size.

1390
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:41,440
He reminds me of my cat.

1391
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,180
I saw that guy.

1392
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,820
I was very excited about him.

1393
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:49,560
That's great seeing you.

1394
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:50,020
I'm exposed.

1395
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,980
Without it, I wouldn't have met all the Eos Spyro for the first time.

1396
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:54,440
Mordekaiser!

1397
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,200
I want to see you.

1398
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,920
Sorry I said, oh my god, I'm next before the meet and greet.

1399
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,800
I didn't have time to prep because I was given to be last minute.

1400
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:03,940
That was you!

1401
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,800
That was so funny.

1402
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:16,640
Unfortunately, for Vexpo, the iPad was a little scuffed sometimes.

1403
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,280
So people were talking to me, but because of the noise cancellation, it was hard to hear sometimes.

1404
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:22,900
So I was like, I know!

1405
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,120
I'm just a bit hairy.

1406
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,640
What, are you that guy?

1407
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:29,680
Are you that little guy?

1408
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,560
What would Paramedic have to say about our little guy?

1409
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,000
Groundhog.

1410
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,060
She'd be like, Snake, have you heard of Groundhog's Day?

1411
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,940
If you're a real maid, can you clean up my room for me?

1412
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,360
A maid cafe maid?

1413
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,380
It's a pretty big decision.

1414
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:01,760
The distinction between a maid maid and a maid cafe.

1415
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,340
You know, it's like a...

1416
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,400
It's like a...

1417
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:15,210
She's still cleaning mine?

1418
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:16,130
Get out of here!

1419
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:18,790
Get out!

1420
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:20,010
Are you saying you're a cosplayer?

1421
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:21,850
No!

1422
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:26,990
Why would you say that?

1423
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:31,910
Can I get a coffee?

1424
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:32,790
Can I get a coffee?

1425
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:34,470
No!

1426
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,510
I'm a real maid in a maid cafe.

1427
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:39,230
No!

1428
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:39,230
I'm a real maid in a maid cafe.

1429
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:40,730
Eat us, delete us, welcome to membership.

1430
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:41,050
Eat us, delete us, welcome to membership.

1431
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:41,430
Thank you!

1432
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:44,490
No, no, not a fake maid.

1433
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:46,110
It's called a maid cafe.

1434
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:48,670
Is it a real maid cafe?

1435
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:49,090
Yes!

1436
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:51,590
Look at all my patrons!

1437
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:53,110
Hold on, hold on.

1438
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:56,190
Look!

1439
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:00,550
This is a real cafe.

1440
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:01,670
This is a real cafe.

1441
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:02,590
This is a real cafe.

1442
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:04,250
Yes, what would you...

1443
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,110
Are you enjoying your meal?

1444
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:07,090
Oh, they're talking.

1445
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:07,490
Sorry.

1446
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:08,930
I didn't mean to disturb you.

1447
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:11,150
I'm gonna sit right here.

1448
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:13,030
And hang out with this guy.

1449
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,500
Are you having a nice day?

1450
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,680
Oh, that seat was taken.

1451
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:29,800
Sorry, I didn't notice.

1452
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:31,720
I sat on that guy.

1453
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,760
Hold on!

1454
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,400
I'm gonna be on the stage!

1455
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,380
I'm on the stage!

1456
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:41,820
Minto World!

1457
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,200
VIP service.

1458
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,520
He was totally unfazed.

1459
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,160
Nice maid cosplay.

1460
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:54,840
Shut up!

1461
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:02,750
I'm gonna eat!

1462
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:04,770
I'm

1463
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:15,330
gonna eat!

1464
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:16,010
Minto World!

1465
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:19,690
Hold on.

1466
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:20,770
Which one is it?

1467
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:22,590
Yaaaah!

1468
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:24,210
Yaaaah!

1469
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:25,670
Yaaaah!

1470
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:29,710
Can you make my meal delicious?

1471
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:30,850
Of course!

1472
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:33,470
Oishikunare!

1473
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,170
Moll!

1474
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:38,890
Cuuuun!

1475
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:39,070
Cuuuun!

1476
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:54,510
I used to have an Elmo doll that I would pluck all the fur off of.

1477
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:00,280
He became bald because of me.

1478
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:11,940
If you want to collab with the maid cafe, maybe consider the Chest of Wonder Mint Cafe.

1479
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,300
I've done VTuber collabs before.

1480
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:13,800
Oh!

1481
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:14,720
What the?

1482
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:15,940
Oh my god.

1483
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:17,600
That's my alarm.

1484
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:22,660
Mint pattern baldness.

1485
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,800
He came out of nowhere.

1486
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,180
No, we were talking about Elmo!

1487
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:27,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

1488
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,220
We were talking about Elmo.

1489
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,380
And I had an Elmo doll that I would...

1490
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:39,960
I also ripped his nose open and started ripping out the stuffing inside his nose too.

1491
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:44,480
So it looked like a long trail of snot.

1492
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:52,420
Do you guys remember when Elmo tweeted like, I hope everybody's okay!

1493
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,100
And people were like, No, Elmo.

1494
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:55,860
We are not okay.

1495
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:56,980
Tiki on the phone.

1496
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,320
Hi!

1497
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:01,880
Tiki!

1498
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:03,180
Tiki!

1499
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:04,700
Cheese!

1500
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,660
Cheese, cheese, cheese.

1501
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,300
Poor Elmo.

1502
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,220
Why the knife?

1503
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:15,760
I don't know.

1504
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,300
Is this better?

1505
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:18,880
Oh, sorry.

1506
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,080
Surely she won't notice.

1507
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,040
Oh, just a box.

1508
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:36,420
Otakus, that was great.

1509
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:36,960
Thanks for coming.

1510
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,640
I got to meet you and I was able to spend...

1511
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,680
Oh, send you a gift.

1512
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,420
Hope you enjoyed the con too.

1513
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,020
Hashtag bored.

1514
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:44,260
Oh, yes.

1515
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,000
I got the bored, yes.

1516
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,540
I got the bored, yes.

1517
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:54,100
I got the cutting bored.

1518
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,280
Shut up in there, will ya?

1519
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:58,520
Knock, knock, knock.

1520
01:18:58,660 --> 01:18:58,900
Knock, knock, knock.

1521
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,840
Was there a knife?

1522
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,000
No.

1523
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:09,960
What's this one?

1524
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,160
A rose.

1525
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:11,860
There was a rose.

1526
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,160
There's no knife in this rose.

1527
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,140
Put it away.

1528
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,140
Put it away.

1529
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:48,960
She lied to us as easily as she breathes.

1530
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,560
I don't breathe.

1531
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:50,220
I'm dead.

1532
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,080
I'm a ghost.

1533
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,980
I don't need to breathe.

1534
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:56,080
I don't need to breathe.

1535
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,700
I don't need to breathe.

1536
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,900
I don't need to breathe.

1537
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,270
What did I just do?

1538
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,390
Oh.

1539
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:27,690
What have you guys been up to...

1540
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:29,370
in the two weeks?

1541
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:30,970
Did you guys go to any events?

1542
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,390
Are there anything that you're looking forward to?

1543
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:39,010
Are there anything that you're looking forward to?

1544
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:40,770
I'll...

1545
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:42,090
Oh.

1546
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,270
A secret project?

1547
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:48,890
Waiting for you to come back?

1548
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:49,630
Stop it.

1549
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,690
Start playing Metal Gear?

1550
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:53,190
The old one.

1551
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:55,290
So Metal Gear, not Metal Gear Solid.

1552
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:57,890
Breaking Dimensions.

1553
01:20:57,950 --> 01:20:58,190
Yeah?

1554
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,210
Did you guys hear the new song?

1555
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:00,530
It's so good.

1556
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:03,390
It's making me feel emotional.

1557
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:09,770
Breaking Dimensions in one week.

1558
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:10,650
And then also...

1559
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:14,970
Mint concert in one week too.

1560
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:18,250
Yeah.

1561
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:19,290
Yeah.

1562
01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:23,950
If you're going to Breaking Dimensions, maybe you can try and go to Mint concert too.

1563
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:25,870
Yeah.

1564
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:28,190
Yeah.

1565
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:31,430
Maybe.

1566
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:34,630
Maybe.

1567
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:34,870
Maybe.

1568
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:37,130
That's the plan.

1569
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:40,570
I wanted to go to both...

1570
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:41,350
Oh, not to both.

1571
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:42,590
I'm going to the one.

1572
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,950
But I wanted to go to Breaking Dimensions too.

1573
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:49,890
What is Breaking Dimensions?

1574
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:51,590
It's the Hololive concert.

1575
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:53,070
At...

1576
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:54,690
During...

1577
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:55,690
I don't think it's at...

1578
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:58,530
Well, it's during Anime NYC.

1579
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:01,010
So...

1580
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:01,490
Hmm.

1581
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:03,330
Minto, please East Coast.

1582
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:05,410
New York is East Coast!

1583
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,690
It's East Coast!

1584
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:12,190
It's just North Coast.

1585
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,110
Did you watch Advent 3D?

1586
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:24,570
I did!

1587
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:27,190
I think...

1588
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:28,710
Actually, the only...

1589
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:31,230
Actually, I need to catch up on Shiori's.

1590
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:33,310
Because...

1591
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:35,490
Hers happened while I was busy.

1592
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:39,250
New York isn't on the coast.

1593
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:39,910
Oh, buddy.

1594
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:41,730
Just shut up.

1595
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:44,050
Sounds like they want South East.

1596
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:47,450
Okay, well ask a convention in the South East...

1597
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:48,590
To invite me.

1598
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:54,540
Ask...

1599
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,360
A convention...

1600
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:59,000
In the South East...

1601
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:01,200
To invite me.

1602
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,260
Contact...

1603
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,080
Your local convention.

1604
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:12,650
Check DMs, I just invited you.

1605
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:13,570
Huh?

1606
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:15,130
Oh my god.

1607
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:18,150
Oh my god, you really did DM me.

1608
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:34,800
I'm interested!

1609
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:40,500
Thanks, Kira.

1610
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,180
Gone in my RTA.

1611
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,440
Yo, no way!

1612
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:02,720
Yippee!

1613
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,320
Okay, see you guys in the South East.

1614
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,060
America.

1615
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,420
The dream is alive.

1616
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,060
You were sick.

1617
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:26,240
You were sick.

1618
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,440
You were sick.

1619
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,060
But, you know...

1620
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:34,440
Obviously, I'm not gonna say...

1621
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,680
Anything yet.

1622
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:36,620
Cause...

1623
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:38,080
You know...

1624
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:43,160
Oh no, she's going to Florida.

1625
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,920
I would love to go to Florida.

1626
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:49,620
I would love to go to Florida.

1627
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:50,180
I would love to go to Florida.

1628
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:50,740
I would love to go to Florida.

1629
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:51,140
And...

1630
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:53,660
Find...

1631
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:55,140
Florida man.

1632
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,440
Collab with him.

1633
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,440
And...

1634
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:00,760
Um...

1635
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:04,440
See what happens.

1636
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:04,860
See what happens.

1637
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:09,960
It's me.

1638
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,820
I'm Florida man.

1639
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,340
Where's your credentials?

1640
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,200
Where's your credentials?

1641
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,000
No, I watched that guy.

1642
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,680
There's a guy on TikTok.

1643
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,700
That goes to the Florida Everglades.

1644
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,300
And he's like, hey guys, I'm in the Florida Everglades.

1645
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,740
And I'm walking around barefoot.

1646
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,020
Oh, here's a snake.

1647
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:27,640
Yoink.

1648
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:28,820
And then...

1649
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:32,320
He just walks around.

1650
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:33,420
Yoink.

1651
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:37,000
Yeah, the swamp puppies.

1652
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,780
I love watching his videos.

1653
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:43,380
Yoink.

1654
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:46,340
I wonder if I could collab with him.

1655
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,140
Do you think he could take me on one of his adventures?

1656
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,900
He's like the modern day...

1657
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:58,100
Steve Irwin.

1658
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,340
Actually, I watch...

1659
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:03,840
I follow only like...

1660
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:07,380
Like a couple creators on TikTok.

1661
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:08,800
Let's see.

1662
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,100
I'm gonna open up TikTok.

1663
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,680
But I'm not gonna watch videos.

1664
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,740
It's just for the numbers.

1665
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:14,700
It's just for the numbers.

1666
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:16,000
It's just for the numbers.

1667
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:17,720
I...

1668
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:20,900
I follow...

1669
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,020
Who the hell is...

1670
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:23,900
Okay, some of these are misclicks.

1671
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:25,880
Oh gosh.

1672
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:26,380
Wait.

1673
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:30,980
Okay.

1674
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,780
I follow a bunch of idols.

1675
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:35,660
And then I follow...

1676
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,180
Um...

1677
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,060
I follow the Yoink guy.

1678
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,160
And I follow Robert Irwin.

1679
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,640
Which is Steve Irwin's son.

1680
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:51,220
I follow idols and animal people.

1681
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,340
That's about it.

1682
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:56,820
Yeah, his son.

1683
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,760
Son of Steve Irwin.

1684
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,100
Yeah.

1685
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,440
I like his videos too.

1686
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,060
And then they make me cry.

1687
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,580
Because it's like...

1688
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:06,900
Oh, Steve Irwin.

1689
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:07,500
Oh no.

1690
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:08,220
I'm gonna cry.

1691
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:09,920
No.

1692
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,520
No.

1693
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,060
I'm gonna cry thinking about...

1694
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:16,800
Steve Irwin.

1695
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,840
Because it makes me...

1696
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:25,530
No.

1697
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:29,940
No.

1698
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,590
I like animals.

1699
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:41,780
No.

1700
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:57,280
I'm gonna cry thinking about...

1701
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:01,280
Oh boy, I'm sorry.

1702
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,920
I'm so sorry, you're too late.

1703
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:02,460
I'm just sad.

1704
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:04,380
Go.

1705
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:16,070
Naah...

1706
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,750
Yeah right now...

1707
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,250
So worse now.

1708
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:18,290
Okay.

1709
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:20,730
Gah!

1710
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,540
What's wrong with me?

1711
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:36,640
Hold on, I'm gonna go get a tissue.

1712
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:42,640
Hold on.

1713
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:37,190
Stop making fun of me.

1714
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:47,830
I'm normal.

1715
01:29:49,930 --> 01:29:50,810
I'm normal.

1716
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:58,770
Still thinking of Steve?

1717
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:12,170
Say it!

1718
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:18,050
Don't say his name!

1719
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:23,990
Hold!

1720
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:26,650
Hold!

1721
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:30,250
Steve Minecraft.

1722
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,170
Minecraft!

1723
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,750
I'm better now!

1724
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:41,270
Actually, I probably...

1725
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:44,070
There's a Minecraft thing I wanna do soon-ish.

1726
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:45,450
I'm waiting for someone.

1727
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:48,750
I don't wanna say it because...

1728
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:49,270
Just yet.

1729
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:51,370
Because...

1730
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:55,450
I don't know if they wanted to keep it a surprise or not.

1731
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:58,430
I think Pusskink will wear those shorts.

1732
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:01,610
Like Steve Irwin's shorts?

1733
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:02,490
Oh, yeah.

1734
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:09,820
No!

1735
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,220
No, his shorts!

1736
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:19,660
No, his shorts!

1737
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:21,980
No!

1738
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:38,820
I'm fine.

1739
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,480
I'm okay.

1740
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:54,780
What is going on?

1741
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:55,880
I don't know anymore!

1742
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,680
I don't even know anymore.

1743
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,140
I'm okay now.

1744
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:11,950
There's a minto-shaped hole in my heart since the last two weeks.

1745
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:15,410
You might want to get that checked out.

1746
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:21,510
I feel cold again, so here's money for you to spend on.

1747
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:22,530
Oh right, no wallet.

1748
01:32:23,450 --> 01:32:25,150
Why are you so mean to me?

1749
01:32:25,830 --> 01:32:27,590
Why are you so mean to me?

1750
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:32,050
I'm literally... I have... You know what?

1751
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,030
Let's do an activity.

1752
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:35,790
Let's count the amount of yen I have in my wallet.

1753
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:37,170
Hold on, I'm gonna go get it.

1754
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:46,880
I said wallet.

1755
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:47,720
I said wallet.

1756
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,120
I meant to say coin purse.

1757
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:52,480
Because I don't have my wallet.

1758
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:53,580
It's my coin purse.

1759
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:54,640
I brought that though.

1760
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,200
I brought my coin purse.

1761
01:32:58,180 --> 01:32:58,940
Okay, let's see.

1762
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,500
I'm gonna put the fives in a category.

1763
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:06,760
The fifties in a category.

1764
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:08,620
Hundreds in a category.

1765
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,500
Okay, lots of tens.

1766
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:13,200
Got a lot of tens.

1767
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:16,780
The yenies in a category.

1768
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,720
Let's see if we can...

1769
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:25,940
I know you guys can't see it, but try and guess without going over, okay?

1770
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,320
Let's put in your guesses.

1771
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:31,380
Actually, here, I'll make a poll.

1772
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:33,880
I'll make a poll.

1773
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:35,600
And you can kind of...

1774
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:38,100
Let's see.

1775
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:41,900
How much yen?

1776
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:42,140
Yen.

1777
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:43,540
Yen.

1778
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:46,740
No...

1779
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:53,730
Let's say...

1780
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:56,210
Let's say...

1781
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:58,570
Since you guys can't see it, I'll give you 700 yen.

1782
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:01,130
About...

1783
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:09,860
About 1,500 yen.

1784
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:12,380
About... yeah.

1785
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:13,500
That should be good.

1786
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,480
So, can't go over.

1787
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:21,080
Alright, I'm organizing.

1788
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:21,860
I'm organizing.

1789
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:25,980
I have a lot of tens.

1790
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,000
I have a lot of tens.

1791
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,520
I have a lot of tens.

1792
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:36,240
I have a lot of tens.

1793
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,240
I have a couple 100s.

1794
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,500
I have a couple 100s.

1795
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,360
I have a few 50s.

1796
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:41,540
I have a few 50s.

1797
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:43,460
Uh...

1798
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,960
Is this like deal or no deal?

1799
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:46,360
Yeah.

1800
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:50,500
I'm sorting them first, and then I'm gonna count them.

1801
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,680
I almost dropped it.

1802
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:54,240
I almost dropped my money.

1803
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:56,780
You keep the money.

1804
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,360
Oh, Asuka.

1805
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,200
I almost dropped my money.

1806
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,060
You keep the money.

1807
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:04,180
I dropped my money.

1808
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,660
Oh, Asuka.

1809
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,540
I'm dropping the money for real.

1810
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,720
Okay, hold on.

1811
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,400
Thanks, everyone.

1812
01:35:18,210 --> 01:35:19,200
I was wondering...

1813
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:22,900
How you only realized the wallet was gone in Japan and not during Otakutan.

1814
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:23,900
Okay.

1815
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,500
I can explain to you why I left my wallet.

1816
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:29,460
I can explain to you why I left my wallet.

1817
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:32,640
So, the purse that I use for my wallet...

1818
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:34,180
So, the purse that I use for my wallet...

1819
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:34,500
Um...

1820
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,240
Is the same purse.

1821
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:38,900
Like, all the time.

1822
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:40,720
So, I never really take my wallet out.

1823
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:46,640
But, I ended up going to the grocery store...

1824
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:46,980
But, I ended up going to the grocery store...

1825
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:48,880
To get some stuff before I left.

1826
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,460
Because I needed...

1827
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:52,100
Uh...

1828
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:53,860
I needed...

1829
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:55,500
Um...

1830
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,560
I mean, I just needed some like...

1831
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,420
Some toiletry stuff, you know?

1832
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,240
Um, like face wash and things like that.

1833
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:05,280
Which I guess I could have gotten in Japan.

1834
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:12,360
Anyway...

1835
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:17,220
I went...

1836
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:18,740
And I...

1837
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:19,480
Um...

1838
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,220
Did not bring my purse.

1839
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,400
I took my wallet out.

1840
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:24,720
And on the way back, I was like...

1841
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,020
Oh, my wallet is...

1842
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:27,940
I cannot have any place to put it.

1843
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:29,920
I'll put it in the grocery bag.

1844
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,000
And so I put it in the grocery bag.

1845
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:35,300
And then I left it in there.

1846
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,060
And then so...

1847
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:38,680
When I left for the airport...

1848
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:40,740
I...

1849
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:43,580
So, basically what had happened was...

1850
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:44,560
I went to Otakutan.

1851
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:45,740
I came back home.

1852
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,280
I had one day to pack for Japan.

1853
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:50,340
And then I left the next day.

1854
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:51,500
So...

1855
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,740
That's when I went into my grocery shopping.

1856
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:56,100
If you're just like, wait, but didn't you come from Otakutan?

1857
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:58,040
Yeah, so I had like one day.

1858
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,120
And so I left it in the grocery bag.

1859
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,120
And uh...

1860
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:08,600
That's what happened.

1861
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:12,900
That's why I left.

1862
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:14,860
Because I never put it in the grocery bag.

1863
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:19,860
And I was stressed about packing.

1864
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:21,200
And I was stressed about packing.

1865
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:22,720
And I was stressed about packing.

1866
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,520
It's so...

1867
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,060
Did you not bring any of your groceries?

1868
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:30,320
Well, some of it was food.

1869
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,160
And I just kind of left my wallet in there.

1870
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:35,560
Like some of it was like...

1871
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:37,120
Oh, this is dinner, you know?

1872
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:40,800
Why don't you put your wallet in your pocket?

1873
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,120
Because it wasn't big enough!

1874
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:49,380
Why did you go grocery shopping the day before you left for Japan?

1875
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:50,680
No, it wasn't like...

1876
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:52,600
It was like for stuff that I needed...

1877
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:53,160
Like for my trip.

1878
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:55,940
And then also like dinner that night.

1879
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:01,100
It wasn't like grocery grocery shopping.

1880
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:02,520
It was just a few things.

1881
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:04,900
Why are you...

1882
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:06,820
Why are you getting...

1883
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:07,500
Why are you...

1884
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:13,040
I think this story is an actual nightmare for traveling.

1885
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:14,280
But at least you brought your passport.

1886
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:15,360
Yeah, I had my passport.

1887
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:17,960
I was able to leave.

1888
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:20,060
Okay, guys.

1889
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,500
I have a 100 yen.

1890
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:25,980
Okay, hold on.

1891
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:27,060
How many tens do I have?

1892
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:34,300
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 100.

1893
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:42,660
What if I go over my own...

1894
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:45,420
I think we're going to go over 1,000 yen, you guys.

1895
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:46,040
Uh-oh.

1896
01:38:46,860 --> 01:39:02,020
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 60, 65, 66, 67, 100,

1897
01:39:05,390 --> 01:39:08,730
300, 400, 450.

1898
01:39:09,130 --> 01:39:10,270
Wait, hold on.

1899
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:11,370
Wait, I'm getting confused.

1900
01:39:11,730 --> 01:39:12,690
Okay, wait.

1901
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:14,510
Wait, I'm getting confused.

1902
01:39:14,890 --> 01:39:16,190
Okay, hold on.

1903
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:20,410
500, 6, 7, 8, 900 yen?

1904
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:22,470
1,000?

1905
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:24,110
1,000?

1906
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:26,210
1,100?

1907
01:39:26,690 --> 01:39:27,490
1200?

1908
01:39:28,210 --> 01:39:28,830
1300?

1909
01:39:29,850 --> 01:39:31,930
1,400?

1910
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:38,590
1, 200, 3, 4.

1911
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:40,070
1,500?

1912
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:47,670
1,500.

1913
01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:52,510
1,516 1,170.

1914
01:39:52,810 --> 01:39:54,810
1,500.

1915
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:57,450
Oh, Oh, we went over.

1916
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:09,980
See, two things in life.

1917
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:15,880
We all lost!

1918
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:16,300
Yippee!

1919
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,420
Uh-oh, my tummy is growling.

1920
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,060
I should probably go get some food.

1921
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:32,600
I should go get some food since I have to leave in like an hour.

1922
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:34,460
Well guys, this was fun!

1923
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:37,140
We'll be streaming again tomorrow.

1924
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:38,660
Scammed.

1925
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:48,590
I have 1,500 yen so I can eat.

1926
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:03,070
My first midstream, I got here late.

1927
01:41:03,170 --> 01:41:04,130
But thanks for dropping by!

1928
01:41:05,130 --> 01:41:06,130
You weren't late.

1929
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:07,730
You're here to hang out at all.

1930
01:41:07,910 --> 01:41:08,670
I appreciate it.

1931
01:41:10,870 --> 01:41:12,910
Oh, my tummy is really starting to growl.

1932
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:14,570
Okay guys, I'm gonna go get some food.

1933
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:19,110
And I'm gonna go get some food at a convenience store or something.

1934
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:23,410
And do you have your sweet corn?

1935
01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:24,770
I do, I do, I do, I do.

1936
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:26,570
It's okay.

1937
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:28,510
I'll be fine until my wallet comes.

1938
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:29,670
No worries.

1939
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:30,650
No worries.

1940
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:32,330
Don't worry about me.

1941
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:33,370
Don't worry.

1942
01:41:33,850 --> 01:41:36,270
Okay, I'm gonna check this tracking right now though.

1943
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:39,210
It hasn't moved in three days.

1944
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:40,510
So it's on its way.

1945
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:41,230
Probably.

1946
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:43,270
Oh, my gosh.

1947
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:43,730
Make day!

1948
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:45,230
Thanks for the 50.

1949
01:41:45,490 --> 01:41:46,910
Thanks for the stream and welcome back.

1950
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:47,530
Thank you!

1951
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:50,730
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1952
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:55,270
Oh, my chat has been weird.

1953
01:41:55,470 --> 01:41:56,130
Okay, there it is.

1954
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:57,350
Not you guys.

1955
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:58,590
The YouTube.

1956
01:42:00,170 --> 01:42:01,130
Welcome back to YouTube.

1957
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:02,290
See you again soon, Mintome.

1958
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:04,870
See you again tomorrow if you guys come see me.

1959
01:42:06,850 --> 01:42:07,290
Mintome!

1960
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:10,890
Fellow Mint.

1961
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:12,370
Thanks for the three months.

1962
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:13,570
Thank you.

1963
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:15,870
Okie dokie.

1964
01:42:17,530 --> 01:42:18,450
Otsuminto, everybody.

1965
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:19,410
Otsuminto.

1966
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:23,430
Have a good rest of your night or your day.

1967
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:25,790
I'm gonna have a busy day ahead of me.

1968
01:42:25,930 --> 01:42:27,930
So I'm gonna go do myself.

1969
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:29,150
I didn't mean to scam you guys.

1970
01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:29,490
Okay.

1971
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:30,350
You know what?

1972
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:31,210
I'm just gonna get out of here.

1973
01:42:33,890 --> 01:42:34,990
We all lost.

1974
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:36,590
So we're all complicit.

1975
01:42:36,690 --> 01:42:36,990
Okay.

1976
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:38,030
Bye-bye.

1977
01:42:38,610 --> 01:42:39,070
Bye.

1978
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:41,110
See you soon.

1979
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:41,190
See you.

1980
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:41,850
See you.

1981
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:42,490
Bye.

1982
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:13,120
Ha!
