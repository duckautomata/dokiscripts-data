1
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,760
Thank you for the Akasuba!

2
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,740
Thank you!

3
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,980
Thank you!

4
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,320
I said in the chat, I was like, no!

5
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,160
No!

6
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,360
Akasuba, no!

7
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,000
Akasuba, no!

8
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,140
Akasuba, no!

9
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,780
If you notice something different about me...

10
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,080
I... I am not...

11
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
I am not an angel.

12
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,020
But I have a halo.

13
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,700
I have...

14
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,540
Shiroko.

15
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,200
Look at her.

16
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,620
Shiroko, she's voiced by Ogura Yui Maiseyu Oshi.

17
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,120
I'm here for Blue Archive!

18
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,460
I'm here...

19
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,840
Where are the horns?

20
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,700
Shiroko doesn't have horns?

21
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,580
There's actually a lot of characters that have horns in Blue Archive.

22
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,860
Oh gosh.

23
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,920
This is gonna turn into a stream about me wanting to talk about...

24
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,440
Blue Archive, I think.

25
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,540
Then...

26
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,260
Then...

27
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,320
Playing Mahjong, maybe.

28
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,140
I'm actually quite nervous.

29
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,280
Because...

30
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,180
I was like, oh my god.

31
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm so nervous.

32
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,260
What if I just like...

33
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,920
I don't know.

34
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,400
Because I get really embarrassed about like...

35
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,160
I don't know.

36
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,740
I don't know.

37
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,740
I just get embarrassed.

38
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,760
I was like...

39
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
It's like...

40
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,000
Learning something like this.

41
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,140
What if I don't get it and people think I'm so dumb?

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,000
Because...

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,840
This is actually not my first time trying to learn Mahjong.

44
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,920
I've tried to learn before in the past.

45
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,500
But I...

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,320
Um...

47
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,420
I...

48
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:25,820
I...

49
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,480
I just didn't get it at all.

50
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,840
It's okay.

51
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,780
We already think that.

52
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,720
Yippee!

53
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,520
It's okay if you don't.

54
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,740
Plenty of streamers don't.

55
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,560
Okay.

56
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,580
Will you guys help me?

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,440
Will you guys help me?

58
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,900
It takes a bit before it clicks.

59
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,940
I've had...

60
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,580
I've had friends try to teach me.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,680
I've had...

62
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,720
I've tried to learn through Mahjong Soul.

63
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,080
Um...

64
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,660
I've tried learning from...

65
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,000
Uh...

66
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,900
Maybe I'm not like...

67
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,660
Applying myself.

68
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,120
As much as I should.

69
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,500
You know?

70
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,840
Maybe I'm just kind of like...

71
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,900
Maybe I'm just kind of like...

72
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,220
Whatever.

73
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,120
Just...

74
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,980
Click...

75
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,920
Click block.

76
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,120
Set block.

77
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,740
Something happened.

78
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,020
I don't know.

79
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,900
I know nothing about Blue Archive nor Mahjong.

80
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,880
Well...

81
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,240
Today you might...

82
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,700
Learn about...

83
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,760
Both.

84
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,680
At least Blue Archive.

85
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,320
I can...

86
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,740
I can...

87
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,040
I can teach you at least about...

88
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,140
Blue Archive.

89
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,040
Which...

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,640
Look at these things.

91
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,000
These girls.

92
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,860
Oh my gosh.

93
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,060
They're so cute.

94
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:28,560
Right?

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,100
That's Shiroko.

96
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,220
She's so cute.

97
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,100
I love...

98
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,860
She's kind of like...

99
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,240
Kudere.

100
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,360
But she's also like...

101
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,660
Silly.

102
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,600
Which is what I really like about her.

103
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,180
Because she's...

104
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,620
She's got like a cool personality.

105
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,580
Thank you.

106
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,180
Gacha funds.

107
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,520
No gacha funds.

108
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,740
Um...

109
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,500
As a Mahjong player, anyone who tells you they know how to play is lying.

110
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,800
That makes me feel a little better.

111
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,520
Yeah.

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:55,620
So...

113
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,920
Shiroko is goofy as hell.

114
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,860
She's so goofy.

115
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,500
She's so...

116
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,780
She's so silly.

117
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,620
Silly Kudere is peak.

118
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,280
Yes.

119
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,640
Right?

120
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,380
I think...

121
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,780
It's like why I love...

122
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,600
Um...

123
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,520
Why I love free runs so much.

124
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,660
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

125
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,460
Thank you.

126
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,420
Number one beginner rule.

127
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,500
Don't call tiles except to win.

128
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,200
What if I know their phone number?

129
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,620
And what if I'm like looking for a little bit of a booty call?

130
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,840
Then can I call them?

131
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,600
What if they tell me...

132
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,800
What if they tell me...

133
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,460
What if they're playing hard to get?

134
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,200
And I'm just trying to like...

135
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,540
You know...

136
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,040
Show that I have interest.

137
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,440
Non-gacha funds.

138
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,380
Thank you.

139
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,060
Yeah.

140
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,720
That's acceptable.

141
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,200
Okay.

142
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,800
An official Mahjong Soul anime came out today.

143
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,640
Wait.

144
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,220
That came out today?

145
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,480
Because I saw...

146
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,540
I saw...

147
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,220
That...

148
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,860
That existed.

149
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,600
That...

150
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,520
But it was today?

151
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,940
That's so funny.

152
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,420
I learned from Saki.

153
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,340
So this should be fine.

154
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,380
Um...

155
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,720
I didn't finish Saki.

156
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,500
But what I learned from Saki is that um...

157
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,620
Panties are overrated.

158
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,960
Nobody in that show wears them.

159
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,220
I'm not asking anyone for a booty call.

160
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,960
It's a boo.

161
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,920
Get it?

162
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,500
Boo.

163
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,820
Booty call.

164
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,360
Aru, my beloved.

165
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,880
This is Aru right here.

166
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,480
She looks very cool.

167
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,020
And very like...

168
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,140
Like...

169
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,920
Mysterious and...

170
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,320
Not mysterious.

171
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,620
Maybe like mature.

172
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:31,900
Mature!

173
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,780
Another M word that I was thinking.

174
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,760
She looks very mature and very cool but she's actually also kind of a girl failure.

175
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,480
This is Hoshino.

176
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,680
She's an ojisan with a tragic past.

177
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,900
And this is Mutsuki.

178
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,820
And she's just a little brat.

179
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,200
She's so cute.

180
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,080
Kind of...

181
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,280
Look.

182
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,760
I'm being...

183
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm being nice, okay?

184
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,380
Silly head empty, Aru, my beloved.

185
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,200
Very girl failure.

186
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,320
She is so kusogaki.

187
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,300
Yeah, she is.

188
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,580
Mutsuki is very kusogaki.

189
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,560
She's very cute.

190
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,860
Very, very cute, Sal.

191
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,740
I don't...

192
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,520
There's...

193
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:18,680
Oh.

194
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,040
I was going to say there's not a single character in Blue Archive that I dislike but I don't think that's true actually.

195
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,700
Okay.

196
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:35,180
There's one girl in Blue Archive who, her voice, like, she's very cute but her voice just grates on me so bad.

197
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,980
So bad.

198
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,180
Ojisan, very cute.

199
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,580
Bashamin!

200
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,680
Shizuko!

201
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,920
How did you guys know?

202
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,840
Wait, is it not just me?

203
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,320
Oh my gosh.

204
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,240
No way.

205
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,000
No way.

206
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,560
No way.

207
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:54,680
No way.

208
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,380
Is it not just me?

209
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,820
I feel really validated right now.

210
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,320
Oh my gosh.

211
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:04,780
I feel...

212
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,920
During the event, there was an event recently in Blue Archive where, like, they did, like, a...

213
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,560
What's the word?

214
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,480
What's the word?

215
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,560
Like a bathing suit.

216
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,140
They were, like...

217
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,920
It was a summer event.

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,160
They were all, like, bathing suits and stuff.

219
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,860
And I could barely touch the event because Shizuko was so...

220
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,080
Oh my gosh.

221
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,780
I would click the page and she would talk and I'd be like...

222
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,100
Ah!

223
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,200
Ah!

224
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,620
Ah!

225
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,020
Oh my gosh.

226
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,100
I'm, like, covering my ear.

227
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,820
I'm like, stop!

228
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,600
Oh my...

229
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:29,800
No.

230
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,340
I feel so bad saying that because I'm sure her seiyuu is, like, super cute and super nice and everything.

231
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,340
She's just doing her best.

232
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,460
Oh my gosh.

233
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,220
And Shizuko is so cute herself, you know?

234
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,920
Didn't know Blue Archive got a new student.

235
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,360
Who's the cute one on the bottom left?

236
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,520
Can we pull her yet?

237
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,740
Will her headpats...

238
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,940
We'll give her headpats in the memorial lobby.

239
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,000
Mutsuki?

240
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,680
Wait, can you see?

241
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:58,740
Mutsuki?

242
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,240
Okay, good.

243
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,720
I was making sure you couldn't...

244
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:00,940
Okay.

245
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,080
Her voice is the best part.

246
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,620
It's...

247
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,580
It's definitely a charm point, I'm sure, for some.

248
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,280
But that event specifically made me be like, oh gosh.

249
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,360
Oh gosh.

250
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,660
Literally one of my favorite aspects about Shizuko is her voice.

251
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,540
That's okay!

252
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,100
Like I said, it is a charm point for some people, you know?

253
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,540
It's a charm...

254
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,820
And I like her...

255
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,780
Her recollection very much.

256
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,320
It's very cute.

257
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,960
She is really cute!

258
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,620
She's very cute.

259
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,580
Why are you upset?

260
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,720
Why are you upset, Yun?

261
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,060
Is it because I said Shizuko bad?

262
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,880
I didn't say Shizuko bad.

263
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,340
I didn't say it though.

264
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,280
But as for my favorite Blue Archive characters, I really like...

265
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,700
Hold on, let me just pull up my...

266
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,060
I've had to do this the other day too.

267
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,080
Let's see.

268
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,920
Actually, did I do my dailies today?

269
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,960
I don't know if I played before the reset or not.

270
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,940
Time to do them now.

271
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,220
We will play Mahjong.

272
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,520
Sorry, everybody.

273
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,260
I'm too busy talking about Blue Archive.

274
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,740
It's the only reason I'm here.

275
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,160
So I play...

276
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,240
I don't play the Japanese Blue Archive.

277
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,600
I play the English Blue Archive.

278
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,100
So...

279
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,740
For now, my favorite characters...

280
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,720
I'm really excited though about the...

281
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,940
There's a battle in progress?

282
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,160
I did?

283
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,520
I had a battle in progress?

284
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,680
Wait.

285
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,260
Who?

286
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,820
Who?

287
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,580
Oh!

288
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,900
Oopsie.

289
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,860
I'm just gonna forfeit.

290
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,600
Quit mission.

291
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,200
Quit.

292
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,560
Oopsie.

293
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,100
Isn't the EN Blue Archive getting the Railgun character soon?

294
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,540
They are!

295
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,600
BA is awful.

296
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,700
Worst FPS I've ever played.

297
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,660
Oh, yes.

298
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,020
The...

299
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,300
Yeah, you know.

300
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,420
I get it.

301
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,120
Where's the first person?

302
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,040
Okay.

303
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,860
Students.

304
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,220
My baby girls are...

305
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:28,740
Koharu.

306
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,160
Cherino.

307
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,380
This is not in any order.

308
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,640
But Koharu and Cherino are like...

309
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,100
Two of my top favorites.

310
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,600
I love Cherino a lot.

311
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,800
She's so dumb.

312
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,580
She's...

313
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,040
She's just so stupid.

314
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,660
I really love Toki.

315
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,480
I do like Hoshino a lot too.

316
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,000
Of course I love Shiroko.

317
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,540
I wanna try...

318
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,140
Actually...

319
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,820
I do like Mutsuki but she's like...

320
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,200
Not one of my top top.

321
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,540
Also, isn't her ear supposed to be like pointy?

322
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,260
Doesn't look as pointy here.

323
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,900
Toki, my beloved.

324
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,560
I actually have a dakimakura of Toki.

325
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,220
I got it at Comiket.

326
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,820
It's...

327
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,340
She's really sexy in it.

328
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,340
I remember seeing...

329
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,820
I remember seeing it from the line waiting to get in.

330
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,000
And...

331
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,800
And...

332
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,960
I was like...

333
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,420
Oh...

334
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,760
I...

335
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,260
Have to go there.

336
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,540
I have to...

337
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,640
Have to go get that.

338
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,640
So...

339
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,200
Because I wasn't familiar with the artist.

340
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,180
But...

341
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,820
I went to Ayami's booth.

342
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,020
And then I went to...

343
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,480
Someone else.

344
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,660
Maybe it was Pan.

345
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,280
Pan no Mimi.

346
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,680
Or Kaori.

347
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,580
But they were very close.

348
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,520
They were very close.

349
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,580
Who's the artist?

350
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,880
Do you guys mind if I get the doujin?

351
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,540
Hold on.

352
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,100
Let me double check.

353
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,660
I should follow them.

354
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,420
Hold on.

355
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,060
I'm gonna turn this down.

356
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,180
The music doesn't loop as like...

357
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,820
The music needs to be a little bit longer.

358
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,320
Okay, hold on.

359
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,540
Let me get the doujin.

360
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,880
I'm really glad I knew where it was.

361
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,040
Because I...

362
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,820
Um...

363
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,260
Went through some of my...

364
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,640
I went through some of my books recently.

365
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,580
So I was...

366
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:29,940
I knew.

367
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,820
I knew where it was.

368
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,160
Um...

369
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,780
Shiro Kitsune.

370
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,140
Shiro Kitsune is the artist.

371
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,540
At Shiroro Kitsune.

372
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,920
So at Shiroro Kitsune.

373
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,760
So instead...

374
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,680
Their name is Shiro Kitsune but their ad is at Shiroro Kitsune.

375
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,580
And if you see the daki, it's so...

376
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,340
It's actually maybe...

377
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,860
It's actually maybe the softest daki makura I've ever owned.

378
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,180
It's so...

379
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,080
Type it in the chatment.

380
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,080
Oh yeah, I can do that.

381
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,720
Give me one second.

382
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,580
At Shiroro Kitsune.

383
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,660
There you go.

384
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,980
It's probably the softest daki makura I've ever owned.

385
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,040
And...

386
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,220
Um...

387
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,040
Toki is just so...

388
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,120
She's so cute.

389
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,680
And so sexy on one side.

390
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,200
She...

391
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,500
It's...

392
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,460
One side is her...

393
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,280
Is her...

394
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,760
Um...

395
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,260
Is this playable on PC?

396
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,640
Yeah!

397
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:34,840
So...

398
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,100
I'm playing it on PC right now!

399
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,400
Um...

400
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:37,940
It's also...

401
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,180
You can play it on browser too.

402
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,040
One side is Mei Toki and the other side, the lewd side is Bunny Toki.

403
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,960
It's so...

404
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,180
Wait.

405
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,040
Did I get that right?

406
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,140
I think so.

407
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,260
Or maybe they were both lewd sides.

408
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,200
Akane is best girl of all time.

409
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,080
Akane is side boob city, baby.

410
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,840
I'm playing it on PC right now.

411
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:17,780
So... I checked in both lewd sides.

412
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,000
Whoopsie.

413
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,060
But it's really cute, right?

414
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,320
It's like... and if you can find it, it's so soft.

415
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,860
It's so soft.

416
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,800
Oh, Ako!

417
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,120
Sorry, I was thinking of Ako.

418
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,660
You're so right.

419
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,520
I was thinking of Ako, not Akane.

420
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,420
Asuna got me into the game but stayed for Hina.

421
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,540
Hina's a good girl.

422
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,320
Oh my gosh!

423
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,940
When I was in Japan, they had a Blue Archive Valentine's event at the Akiba and Atore.

424
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,840
And they had Hina's little floatie.

425
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,920
They had her floatie that she has in her bathing suit.

426
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,560
Not uniform.

427
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,380
Outfit!

428
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,620
And it's like this cute cushion.

429
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,340
It's so cute!

430
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,220
Oh my gosh!

431
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,020
It's so, so... it's so cute!

432
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,500
And it's really, really soft.

433
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,580
I like sit on it sometimes and... yeah!

434
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,840
It's kind of a uniform.

435
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,780
It's her school swimsuit.

436
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,040
Yeah!

437
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,860
That's true.

438
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,340
And they also had a t-shirt.

439
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,240
A t-shirt of her... of the swimsuit.

440
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,340
And it's like... you would think that... like maybe it's a shirt that's cotton.

441
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:34,760
No!

442
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,040
It feels like a swimsuit material.

443
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,480
So I bought it really oversized so that I can just wear it.

444
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:50,460
And like have my little floatie and pretend that I'm... I don't know... this is my stupid at home cosplay.

445
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,220
My favorite is the stink ball.

446
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,000
Sorry, I mean...

447
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,380
I forgot... I was like playing the other day and I was like...

448
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,480
I was like looking up how to... I couldn't get through a battle.

449
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:16,560
And... I looked it up and it said to... it recommended swimsuit Ui and I was like... I don't have that!

450
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,440
But I did!

451
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,640
I'm just an idiot.

452
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,140
Anyway...

453
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:23,900
Majan!

454
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,700
I want to go to the event but we won't.

455
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,520
Because... wait how do I... oh here we go.

456
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,360
I will not go to the event but...

457
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,780
Because we have... tutorials to do.

458
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,140
Chapter 1.

459
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,860
Majan tiles.

460
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,060
Guys, we're gonna learn Majan today, okay?

461
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,740
We're gonna learn Majan today together, okay?

462
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,520
Please help me.

463
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,720
And then we're gonna roll...

464
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,800
Hello?

465
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,440
Oh, here we go.

466
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,400
Then we're gonna roll.

467
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,120
We're gonna roll and then play.

468
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,620
Step 1.

469
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,780
Eat the tiles.

470
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,690
I'm gonna actually also open a notepad so I can take notes.

471
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,110
I'm scared.

472
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,690
Baby Gory thanks for the gifted!

473
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,990
Oh no, how do I say your name?

474
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,230
I'm gonna say Deodato!

475
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,650
Thank you for the five gifted!

476
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,610
How do I say it with the squiggly?

477
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,630
Roll on which banner?

478
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,290
Blue Archive, of course!

479
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:28,990
Okay.

480
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,210
Welcome to Majan Sho...

481
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,870
Welcome to Majan Sho Shrine!

482
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,630
Are you here for fun times?

483
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,950
Playing Majan as well?

484
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,870
No, I'm here for serious times.

485
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,830
Let's learn the basic rules of Majan first.

486
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,630
Majan has 34 different tiles.

487
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,610
They can be sorted into five groups.

488
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,690
Man, Pin, Sho, Wind, and Dragon.

489
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:55,930
Man?

490
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,510
Okay, Man is like...

491
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,090
The 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

492
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:00,910
9...

493
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,490
Pin is...

494
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,490
Like a pinwheel.

495
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,110
Sho is...

496
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,330
So tall bamboo.

497
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,310
Wind is...

498
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,230
Is...

499
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,390
East...

500
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,670
Wind is...

501
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,370
The directions that it goes in.

502
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,450
East, South, North, West.

503
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,130
Dragon is...

504
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,990
The dragon inside.

505
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:30,510
Inside of me.

506
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,290
Inside me there are two dragons.

507
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,840
So tall bamboo.

508
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,800
Okay.

509
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,080
There are four of each tile.

510
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,020
Wait, what do you mean there's four of each tiles?

511
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,100
There's nine.

512
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,480
So in total there are 136 tiles?

513
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,600
Oh, four copies.

514
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,740
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

515
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,660
I was like...

516
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,960
Can you count, little cat girl?

517
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,060
Sorry, you can't see her.

518
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,860
She's so cute though.

519
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,020
She's so cute.

520
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,280
Sequence.

521
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,500
Three consecutive number tiles.

522
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:14,920
Okay.

523
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,620
Sequence.

524
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,180
I feel like this is actually going to be on the test.

525
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,020
Three consecutive number tiles of the same group.

526
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,160
Oh, I wrote name group.

527
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,400
Of the same group.

528
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,180
Okay.

529
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,920
So sequence is like...

530
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:29,800
Three...

531
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,760
Three minds.

532
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,040
Three pins.

533
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,120
Three souls.

534
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,640
Triplet.

535
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,280
Is three...

536
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,820
Triplet.

537
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,960
Three identical tiles.

538
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,620
Okay.

539
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:42,940
Okay.

540
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,900
And then pair.

541
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,720
Two identical tiles.

542
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,080
Okay.

543
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,380
We're...

544
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:48,940
We're...

545
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,600
We're...

546
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:49,920
We're...

547
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
We're making notes.

548
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,720
Easy.

549
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,420
Easy.

550
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:52,800
Easy.

551
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,820
Thank God they have the numbers in the corners.

552
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,920
Oh, yeah.

553
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,780
If you can't read it, it could be confusing.

554
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,240
Right?

555
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:01,580
Wait.

556
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,080
Okay.

557
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,180
I just realized.

558
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,180
The sequence has to be like six, seven, eight.

559
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,460
Right?

560
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,300
It can't be like four, eight, nine or something.

561
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:13,660
Right?

562
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,720
Like it has to be like three consecutive consecutive.

563
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:17,960
Right?

564
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,540
So...

565
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:19,720
Oh, yeah.

566
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:19,920
Yeah.

567
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,080
Here.

568
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,700
See the sequence.

569
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,560
Three, four, five.

570
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,760
Seven, eight, nine.

571
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,920
Five, six, seven.

572
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,960
Can I...

573
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,360
Hold on.

574
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,780
I'm going to put my...

575
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,200
I'm not putting on my glasses.

576
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,670
Putting on my glasses for this.

577
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,270
So I can really learn.

578
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,660
Okay.

579
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,360
Okay.

580
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,380
Okay.

581
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,560
We're good.

582
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:57,920
We're good.

583
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,560
I'm learning.

584
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,260
I'm learning.

585
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,360
I'm learning.

586
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:00,920
I'm learning.

587
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,360
I'm learning.

588
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,680
Don't McDonald's say no.

589
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,180
NERD!

590
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,300
DON'T SAY NERD!

591
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,540
Is she rolling for Hoshino?

592
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,920
I'm rolling for...

593
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,160
everybody.

594
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,720
Because I like all of them.

595
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,580
All the... everybody that's in the collab at least.

596
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,260
I'm so bad.

597
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,120
There's so many girls.

598
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,920
I'm really bad at remembering a bunch of names.

599
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,640
If you say somebody and I'm like, who?

600
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,780
It's because I'm bad with the names in Blue Archive.

601
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,340
Okay, four sequences...

602
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,400
Okay, wait.

603
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,100
Okay, so four sequences or triplets...

604
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,140
plus one pair equals winning!

605
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,700
Winning!

606
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,100
Winning!

607
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,020
Okay, so pair is too identical.

608
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,480
Or a triplet.

609
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,160
Four sequences or triplets...

610
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,480
plus one pair equals winning!

611
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,120
Winning!

612
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,520
Winning!

613
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,300
This game is like poker but tiles instead of cards.

614
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:06,760
You know what?

615
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,820
I never could understand poker either, so...

616
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,820
NERD!

617
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,500
Says you!

618
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,960
With your silly...

619
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,320
ducky hoodie!

620
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,120
Come on!

621
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,280
The main objective of Mahjong is complete a winning hand.

622
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,460
Usually it means the player has to achieve a hand consisting of...

623
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,320
four sequences slash triplets plus one pair.

624
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,080
To reach that goal, each turn you draw one tile...

625
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,900
from the tile wall.

626
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,250
And if it's not the winning tile, you choose one tile to discard and maintain...

627
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,680
a hand consisting of 13 tiles.

628
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,040
Step by step, you will get closer to a winning hand.

629
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,700
Okay.

630
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,240
NERD!

631
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,600
Who's hand was that?

632
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,020
Oh my god.

633
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,920
Here, let's discard the west tile that's unneeded here.

634
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,260
Yeah, we don't need this one.

635
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,620
That's my hand.

636
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,420
Okay.

637
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,760
In addition to the tile group requirement to win...

638
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,620
the winning hand must also contain at least one yaku.

639
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,420
What's a yaku?

640
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,240
Simple yaku.

641
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:26,660
Wait.

642
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,040
Huh?

643
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,740
Wait, the text is so...

644
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,880
Oh, I have to scroll?

645
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,360
I have to scroll to go through the text?

646
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,840
Huh?

647
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,460
No yaku.

648
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,620
Yaku equals win conditions.

649
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,320
It's a valid hand.

650
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,860
Of course it is.

651
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,540
So...

652
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,640
I want to introduce a really popular and easily achievable yaku.

653
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,860
All simples.

654
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,940
Also called tanyao.

655
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,740
If your hand only has number tiles with numbers from 2 to 8...

656
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,820
In other words...

657
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,380
Does not have honor tiles...

658
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,840
Wind or dragon tiles...

659
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,160
Or terminal tiles...

660
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,400
Number tiles with 1 or 9...

661
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,900
Then it meets the requirements for all simples.

662
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,020
So let's try it out.

663
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,620
Okay, so no 1s or 9s...

664
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:22,940
Okay, hold on.

665
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,020
Yaku...

666
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,720
No 1 or 9...

667
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,100
No wind...

668
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,220
No dragon...

669
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,900
Hmm...

670
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,620
What's this one?

671
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,540
Why is it just blank?

672
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,520
It's like...

673
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:37,680
Who?

674
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,840
Who is this?

675
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,500
Who?

676
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:40,980
Okay.

677
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,140
So just...

678
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,240
Anything else?

679
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,660
Just say 2 through 8.

680
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,340
Yeah, yeah.

681
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,420
2 through 8.

682
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,800
Good.

683
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,480
2 through 8.

684
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,620
What's 4 doing all the way over here?

685
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:58,980
Hmm...

686
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,040
Oh, white dragon.

687
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,450
Okay.

688
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,270
I...

689
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,230
I don't know...

690
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:15,490
Okay.

691
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,290
Hold on.

692
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,870
We already have 1 triplet.

693
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,770
Yes, right here.

694
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,070
This is our triplet.

695
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,190
The...

696
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,570
The...

697
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,410
The 2s.

698
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,490
Sorry, I'm blocking a little bit of it.

699
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,510
2 sequence.

700
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,050
6, 7, 8.

701
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:33,590
Here.

702
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:34,970
And 1 pair.

703
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,250
Wait, what's the pair?

704
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,410
2 identical tiles.

705
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,430
Here!

706
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,290
Here's our...

707
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,010
Here's our pair.

708
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,630
Here's our pair.

709
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,070
Here's our pair.

710
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,750
So, once we have completed the last sequence, we have a winning hand!

711
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,830
And it meets the requirement for all symbols.

712
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,150
Get rid of you.

713
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,550
When your hand is waiting for the winning tile like this, you are in Tenpai.

714
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:07,410
If you have Yaku and are in Tenpai, you just need someone to discard the last needed tile or draw it yourself to win.

715
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,310
Wait, why discard the last needed tile?

716
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,470
Am I allowed to take their tiles?

717
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,020
Yeah, we have double here.

718
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,080
So, we need a...

719
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,400
So, we have triplet.

720
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,420
1 sequence.

721
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,380
2 sequence.

722
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,100
Oh, wait.

723
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,560
Hmm?

724
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,780
Wait.

725
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,100
Hmm?

726
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,600
Wait.

727
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,900
I have a question.

728
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,100
If it's...

729
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,280
So, is it 4 sequences?

730
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,500
Okay, if I have 2 sequences and 2 triplets, is that...

731
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,020
Is that okay?

732
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,800
Mahjong is easy.

733
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
Don't worry about it.

734
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:44,820
Okay.

735
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,780
Yeah.

736
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,060
Yes?

737
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,440
That's okay?

738
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,460
Oh, okay.

739
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:50,740
Okay.

740
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:50,920
Okay.

741
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,120
Okay.

742
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,800
Yes.

743
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,540
Plus the pair.

744
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,320
So, it's just 4 sets in total.

745
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:55,900
Okay.

746
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,840
Let me write that.

747
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,160
In...

748
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,800
In total.

749
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,000
So, 4...

750
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,760
So, okay.

751
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,640
So, we have 1 triplet.

752
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
1 sequence.

753
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,340
1...

754
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,260
2 sequences.

755
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,780
So, we need...

756
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,900
And then...

757
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,280
And then a pair.

758
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,160
So, we need either a 3 or we need 6.

759
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,200
Okay.

760
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,680
Okay.

761
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,540
So, that'll make 3 sequences and then 1 triplet, which is 4 in total.

762
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,300
Oh my gosh.

763
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,180
I can do math.

764
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,200
I'm...

765
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,160
I'm...

766
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,840
I'm...

767
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,340
I'm adding.

768
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,240
Addition.

769
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,140
Subtraction.

770
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,760
Multiplication.

771
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,320
Okay.

772
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:43,900
Okay.

773
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,880
Okay.

774
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,320
Give me...

775
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,560
Give me...

776
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,780
That's the tile we...

777
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,500
Tile we need.

778
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,380
That one right there.

779
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,220
We can win now.

780
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,260
Tap the run button.

781
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,160
Run.

782
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:52,780
Run.

783
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,160
Run.

784
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,920
This is going to take my brain into overdrive.

785
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,180
Holy cow.

786
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,020
Congratulations on the win.

787
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,260
Yeah.

788
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,700
This is the end of today's practice session.

789
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,580
You can review the tutorial by chapter or just check out the review.

790
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,220
Thank you.

791
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,180
And I'll see you guys later.

792
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,440
Peace.

793
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,440
Yippee!

794
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,060
Give me the coins.

795
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,320
The copper.

796
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,200
Is that how we do the gacha?

797
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,060
Hold on.

798
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,820
I kind of wanna check.

799
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,520
How do we do the gacha?

800
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,120
Why not take a breather and check out a festival at another school?

801
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:45,650
Oh.

802
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:54,490
Following the recent upheaval at Abidos High School, Shiroko and Hoshino followed Sensei's advice and took a bus to Aleid Hyakugan.

803
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,950
Hyakkiyako Academy for their festival.

804
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,370
Or at least that's what they thought they were doing.

805
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,870
Gatcha needs premium currency.

806
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:05,950
No!

807
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,570
Oh my gosh.

808
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,850
This doesn't look like Hyakkiyako Academy.

809
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,890
Wait, there's a whole story even?

810
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,150
Shiroko stared at the school in front of her with a blank expression.

811
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,070
Next to her, Hoshino yawned unconcernedly.

812
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,030
Clearly, we're in the wrong place.

813
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,570
Look, the pillar over there says this is Asaha High School.

814
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,090
Is it Allied?

815
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,190
Allied?

816
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,170
And it was shaping up to be such a nice day.

817
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,130
Even you dozed off for a bit, Shiroko.

818
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,370
I thought we were at Allied.

819
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,830
Allied Hyakkiyako Academy.

820
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,870
I'm sorry.

821
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,990
I should have paid more attention.

822
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,150
to the name of the stop.

823
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,310
I'll go see you when the next bus arrives.

824
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,210
Give me the gatcha.

825
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,990
We want to go to a school festival.

826
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,810
Here is just as good as anywhere.

827
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,690
Why are Abito students at Neo Japan High?

828
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,510
Looks like they're having a festival too.

829
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,110
Why don't we go in and have a little fun?

830
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,850
Look, she must have been late for school.

831
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,570
She's got her toast in her mouth and everything.

832
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,470
If you're sure, then I guess it would be okay.

833
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,250
I'm sure.

834
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,170
Shall we?

835
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,670
What a coincidence.

836
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,590
The problem solvers are here.

837
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,650
They're so cute.

838
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,370
Look at them.

839
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,910
Shiroko is so cute.

840
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,390
There was the Blue Archive like...

841
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,630
What's the word?

842
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,110
The Blue Archive...

843
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,390
anniversary festival thing?

844
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,130
And they sold her scarf and her...

845
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,090
and her ears and her...

846
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,810
little hair pin.

847
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,910
And I bought all of it.

848
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:09,550
Just as Hoshino and Shiroko approached the gates, they heard a voice call out from behind them and turned to see two familiar figures.

849
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:14,750
President Riko Hachimaru and Asagi Mutsuki.

850
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:18,490
Members of Gehenna Academy's infamous Problem Solver 68.

851
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,870
Known as the Outlaws of Kivotos.

852
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:26,310
Their four-member team is so close-knit that they've been known to happily split a bowl of ramen between them.

853
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:32,690
They are the inheritors of the masked swimsuit gang's legacy and build themselves as reliable and trustworthy...

854
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:32,970
Oh, sorry.

855
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:40,110
Reliable and trustworthy when it comes to fulfilling some rather dubious contracts.

856
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,450
Good morning, friends of Abydos High School.

857
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:46,730
Good morning.

858
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,990
Were you also summoned here?

859
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:51,730
Summoned?

860
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,450
Lore dump.

861
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,050
Yeah, split the ramen bowls for bonding.

862
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:57,910
No other reason.

863
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,450
No.

864
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,290
No, it's not like...

865
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,990
Oh my gosh, look at the tummy detail on Aru.

866
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,510
Just a rumor I heard.

867
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,250
It's nothing.

868
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,770
Did Asaha High School hire you?

869
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,610
Yeah, we got a last-minute call yesterday.

870
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,550
Tough job.

871
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,110
Nothing Problem Solver 68 can't handle.

872
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,070
We never leave loose ends.

873
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,050
Cuckoo.

874
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,910
How very professional of you.

875
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,470
Hehe.

876
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,210
I make us look so good.

877
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:34,690
Aru.

878
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,410
She looks so cute.

879
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,610
Oh my gosh.

880
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,810
They look so good.

881
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,330
Aru prefers big jobs.

882
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,090
But actually, things have been pretty slow lately.

883
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,250
We don't have the luxury of being choosy about contracts right now.

884
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,290
Mutsuki's naughty face, I know.

885
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,630
Are you two just here to hang out?

886
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,450
Yes.

887
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:04,550
Sensei suggested we should take some time to relax and check out another school's festival.

888
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,630
Oh, that sounds nice.

889
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:09,730
Ahem.

890
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,150
It's getting late, Mutsuki.

891
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,830
And we shouldn't keep our client waiting.

892
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,950
It's bad business.

893
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,230
If you'll excuse us.

894
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:27,310
Aru flashed a perfunctory smile and set off towards the school.

895
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,170
Mutsuki waved goodbye to Hoshino and Shiroko and followed.

896
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,090
perfunctory...

897
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,160
I don't know much of Blue Archive, but I think I've seen that blue cat at the bank before.

898
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,720
How could you tell from her disguise?

899
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,520
Happy Bunch Art Day.

900
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,840
Shall we head in too?

901
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,460
Sure.

902
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:07,860
So the Foreclosure Task Force and Problem Solver 68 joined the festivities inside Asaha High School.

903
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,200
Asaha High School is holding a school festival with lots of fun activities and delicious food, nya!

904
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,020
Oh my gosh, it's a bop!

905
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:32,610
But they are short on manpower, so they ask if Master can help out with approving proposals, nya!

906
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:38,390
Ichiyun-hime has already said yes and ate the pudding, so Master can't say no, nya.

907
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,330
We are number one!

908
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,810
I hear it.

909
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,090
I don't think I'm gonna be able to unhear it.

910
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,750
nya nya!

911
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,930
We already got a proposal here!

912
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,850
Master, let's tap on this proposal and check out the content, nya!

913
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:07,050
I propose we forbid Ichihime to take part in the festival.

914
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,550
She already has cleared the stock of the snacks, nan.

915
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:11,930
At the school gate.

916
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,190
Strongly agree.

917
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,510
M-Master, don't take this prank seriously, nya!

918
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:22,910
Anyway, when you approve a proposal, the three fest stats will change, nya.

919
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,100
There's mashups of the two!

920
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,540
I can believe it.

921
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,020
When the fest stats meet the rank up requirement, the fest rank will go up.

922
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,920
The current rank is E-, so we still have a long way to go.

923
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,580
But I'm sure Master can do it, nya.

924
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,020
The good news is that Master won't be working alone, nya.

925
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,920
A few special guests have arrived at the festival, and they will help you out, nya.

926
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,220
Let's go meet them now.

927
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,440
Nan- Hold

928
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,200
on.

929
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,440
How do I pull them?

930
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,540
How do I get them?

931
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,140
Tutorial.

932
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,280
During the festival...

933
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,000
Level up.

934
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,860
Level up.

935
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,240
Level up.

936
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,320
Confirm.

937
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,350
To the shop?

938
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:22,430
To the shop?

939
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,150
Where do I pull them at?

940
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,190
Oh, shop.

941
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,090
Wait, they have...

942
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,290
They have their own outfits?

943
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,830
Shi-shi-shi-shiroku!

944
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,550
Oh my god.

945
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,470
You haven't gotten this character yet.

946
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:02,450
Not yet.

947
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:02,730
Not yet.

948
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,810
Oh my god.

949
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,310
Shi-shi-shi-shiroku!

950
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:13,370
Oh my god.

951
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:13,910
It's so cute.

952
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,570
It's so cute.

953
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,500
Wishing.

954
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,200
Star.

955
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,860
Look how cute.

956
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,240
The art is all so cute.

957
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,760
Fortune.

958
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,420
Background.

959
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,410
Fortune.

960
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:35,970
Background.

961
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,190
It says first, then money for skins.

962
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,050
How do I...

963
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,430
Wait, so the shop is...

964
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,910
Is it summon?

965
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,590
Ah!

966
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,570
Here we are.

967
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,190
Uh oh.

968
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,950
Let's learn how to...

969
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,810
Wait, what's the difference between bamboo club...

970
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,350
and sakura club?

971
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,610
Let's learn how to play first.

972
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,890
The more I play...

973
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:07,150
Because, you know, I don't want to just spend money on them and be like, Man, I hate mahjong.

974
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,470
Let's keep doing the tutorials.

975
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,250
Yeah, let's keep doing the tutorials.

976
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,190
Oh, here's the yak.

977
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,950
I hate mahjong.

978
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,310
Bamboo has men.

979
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,510
Oh wait, sakura has other female characters.

980
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,510
Bamboo has male.

981
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,630
Oh no.

982
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:29,670
Okay.

983
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,390
Thanks for letting me know.

984
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,510
The red mark on the table has moved.

985
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,010
It means the dealer seated east has changed.

986
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,070
This is an east wind match.

987
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,410
So the match ends when every player has been dealer one time.

988
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,890
Don't think of running away before the match ends.

989
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:51,070
When the match ends, the four players will be ranked from first to fourth.

990
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,090
Do your best to aim for first place.

991
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:03,410
The east two in the center indicates that the match is the second game of the east wind round.

992
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,990
East wind is the current prevalent wind.

993
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,370
X69 indicates the number of tiles remaining.

994
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:17,470
If this number becomes zero, then the game will end even if no one wins.

995
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,710
Okay.

996
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,680
What does the prevalent wind mean?

997
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,440
The W in front of you indicates you are seated west in this game.

998
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,460
And west is your seat wind.

999
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,170
It's a lot to take in, but it does make sense.

1000
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:45,790
Eventually.

1001
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,710
Yeah, we're in the W spot.

1002
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:53,910
A triplet of prevalent wind and a triplet of seat wind are both very common yakus.

1003
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,710
Oh, that's right.

1004
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:56,470
They said the...

1005
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,830
Okay, so there was the yakus, which is...

1006
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,130
Which is...

1007
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,350
Two through eight.

1008
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,790
So this is also a yaku we can have, right?

1009
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,290
Yakuhai.

1010
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,510
So a triplet of a seat wind.

1011
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,390
Okay, hold on.

1012
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:14,870
Yaku.

1013
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,550
One.

1014
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,090
Yaku two.

1015
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:28,950
A triplet of prevalent wind.

1016
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,310
So the prevalent wind would then be...

1017
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,450
Okay, east wind round.

1018
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,310
Oh, so it's because...

1019
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,310
Wait, is it east wind?

1020
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,510
Wind round because it's east and I'm sitting west?

1021
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:45,410
Wait, no.

1022
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,250
Oh, never mind.

1023
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:46,610
Sorry.

1024
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,110
I was confusing wind and west.

1025
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:56,730
Weast?

1026
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:57,610
I mean, wait.

1027
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:58,370
What?

1028
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:59,070
East?

1029
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,370
I thought you meant weast.

1030
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,180
Okay.

1031
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,540
Now it makes...

1032
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:11,400
Okay, I was thinking east west round, but it's east wind round.

1033
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,600
Okay, that makes so much more sense.

1034
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,020
What's the two for though?

1035
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,440
And we are sitting west.

1036
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,140
So we can either get the prevalent wind or we could get our seat wind.

1037
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,460
Prevalent wind.

1038
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:22,920
Oh, wait.

1039
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,120
And a triplet of seat wind.

1040
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,080
So you need both?

1041
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:29,820
Okay.

1042
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,340
If you get three west tiles, then you can win with seat wind.

1043
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,800
West as Yaku.

1044
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,550
Oh, it's either or?

1045
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,290
Because it says here and.

1046
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,170
A triplet of prevalent wind and a triplet of seat wind.

1047
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:54,750
Oh.

1048
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,370
So, okay.

1049
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:56,730
Or.

1050
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,230
Triplet of prevalent wind or triplet of seat wind.

1051
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,330
Both are Yakus.

1052
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,030
You can get both.

1053
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,590
Either, either, either.

1054
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,110
Read the whole sentence?

1055
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:11,890
I did.

1056
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:14,970
I did.

1057
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,850
You can't say that to me when I literally read the whole sentence.

1058
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,410
I literally just confused wind for west.

1059
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:20,750
Okay?

1060
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,130
My brain is small.

1061
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,430
My glasses are the wrong prescription.

1062
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:38,430
If any other player discards a tile and you have two tiles of the same kind in your hand, you can call Pon to form a triplet.

1063
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:44,050
Upon calling Pon, you shall openly place the triplet formed in the corner of your table.

1064
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,370
Don't miss this tile.

1065
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:47,910
Pon!

1066
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:49,670
Pon-ya!

1067
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,470
After you called Pon successfully, discard one tile from your hand.

1068
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,030
Oh, okay.

1069
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,050
Goodbye tile.

1070
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,420
What the hell was this one?

1071
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:10,320
If the player on your left discards a tile that can form a sequence with two tiles in your hand, you can call Chi on that tile.

1072
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:16,220
Upon calling Chi, you shall openly place the sequence formed in the corner of your table.

1073
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,340
Wait, what did they place?

1074
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:20,480
The six?

1075
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:21,420
Wait.

1076
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,860
On my left.

1077
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,460
Oh, hold on.

1078
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,260
I need to read this again.

1079
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,300
Pon and Chi can mess up your hand if you aren't careful.

1080
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,200
Okay.

1081
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,080
Go to settings and turn on the tile numbers.

1082
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,980
Easier for a while.

1083
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:34,940
Yeah, I will do that.

1084
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,480
I didn't know...

1085
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,260
I thought it...

1086
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,420
Because it showed it before, I thought it would stay, but it does not.

1087
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,240
Wait, okay.

1088
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:48,180
So the player on my left discards a tile that can form a sequence with two tiles, then I can call Chi.

1089
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:49,700
Okay.

1090
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:49,860
Okay.

1091
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,380
Okay.

1092
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,520
Okay.

1093
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,660
Only from left hand player.

1094
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,060
From any player.

1095
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,320
I see.

1096
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,920
Sometimes you don't want to call Chi, but you don't understand the bigger hands in it.

1097
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,100
Yeah, I don't know anything.

1098
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:08,760
Chi.

1099
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,780
Chi-nya.

1100
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,680
Chi-nya.

1101
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,640
After you call Chi successfully, discard one tile from your hand, too, nya.

1102
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,260
Okay.

1103
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,180
Okay.

1104
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,920
What is that?

1105
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,100
Goodbye tool.

1106
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,020
Now you've reached tenpai.

1107
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,380
What was tenpai again?

1108
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,480
Oh wait, it's when we have a hand but we're waiting for one thing, right?

1109
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,920
When you draw one pin or four pin...

1110
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,020
...yourself or someone else discards either tile, you win.

1111
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,780
Yeah, one tile from winning.

1112
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,240
Ready to win.

1113
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,160
Okay, okay, I kinda remember.

1114
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,320
Confusing kanji at the bottom is man.

1115
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,780
It is?

1116
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:04,840
This one?

1117
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,080
Okay.

1118
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,320
Okay, so I need...

1119
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,700
So they say one pin.

1120
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,620
So we need the pair, right?

1121
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,320
Because we have...

1122
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,720
Okay, sorry, I'm gonna be explaining everything out so slowly for me to learn this.

1123
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,440
So we have...

1124
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,000
Three...

1125
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,260
Wait, we have...

1126
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,100
We have a sequence...

1127
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,740
And we have...

1128
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,100
Our prevalent...

1129
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,560
Our prevalent...

1130
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:39,760
Wind.

1131
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,560
Okay.

1132
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,140
So now we just need...

1133
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,260
Wait...

1134
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,340
So we need...

1135
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:55,880
Either...

1136
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,000
We have a...

1137
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,300
We have a sequence here.

1138
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,400
And we have a triplet here.

1139
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,620
One, two...

1140
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,440
Three...

1141
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,920
So then...

1142
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,720
If we get...

1143
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,640
This is a pair...

1144
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,760
Or this is a pair.

1145
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,480
Why couldn't we...

1146
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,080
Oh, because then it will break the sequence.

1147
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:19,520
Okay.

1148
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,520
I get it, I get it.

1149
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,460
So this becomes a sequence.

1150
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,840
Or like...

1151
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,300
This becomes a sequence if we get the four.

1152
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,420
Or this is a sequence...

1153
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,220
This is the sequence if we get the one.

1154
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,260
Okay, okay, okay.

1155
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,560
Maybe some of us are learning together.

1156
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:34,540
So...

1157
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,940
This is kind of good, maybe.

1158
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:38,420
Okay.

1159
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,180
So that would make...

1160
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,000
The yaku...

1161
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,100
One, two, three, four.

1162
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,200
Okay, okay, okay.

1163
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,220
I got it.

1164
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:48,880
Okay, okay.

1165
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,440
Okay, okay.

1166
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,130
We got...

1167
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:57,590
This!

1168
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,070
Wait, if you have four of the same tile...

1169
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:00,910
You can type kan.

1170
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:04,770
And these tiles will be placed in the right corner.

1171
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,230
And you get to draw one tile...

1172
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:08,270
And then discard one tile.

1173
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,370
This is called a closed kan.

1174
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,570
And the quad formed here is considered...

1175
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:13,690
A kind of triplet.

1176
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,850
Oh, oh, okay.

1177
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:20,370
Closed kan!

1178
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,430
It's a shame that we didn't win with the drawn tile.

1179
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:26,750
Let's discard it.

1180
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:27,890
See ya.

1181
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:29,470
Okay.

1182
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:30,170
Oh, oh!

1183
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:30,590
Non!

1184
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:35,770
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

1185
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:38,490
Yippee!

1186
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,690
We won the tutorial!

1187
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:45,290
Oh my gosh.

1188
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,690
I feel like I'm in...

1189
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,290
Kaiji just a little bit more.

1190
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:50,830
Congratulation on the win-ya!

1191
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,110
This is the end of today's practice.

1192
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,950
You can review the tutorial...

1193
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:55,590
Okay.

1194
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:58,710
Woohoo!

1195
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,950
Zawa, zawa, zawa, zawa.

1196
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:02,270
Okay.

1197
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,250
Let's get our money.

1198
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:06,890
Copper...

1199
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:07,790
Michi!

1200
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:08,950
Okay.

1201
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:14,930
Zawa, zawa, zawa, zawa.

1202
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,150
Oh yeah, go to option.

1203
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:20,050
Thank you for reminding me.

1204
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,250
Um...

1205
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:23,530
Under...

1206
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:28,060
Oh, uh, this one.

1207
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,300
There we go.

1208
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:34,730
Perfect, perfect.

1209
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,780
Next tutorial.

1210
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:42,960
Oh wait, oops.

1211
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,240
Michi.

1212
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,460
You could say nonsense...

1213
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,060
and I'd believe it was a mahjong term.

1214
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,020
The only thing I really knew was...

1215
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:54,500
Don.

1216
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,680
I only really knew about the...

1217
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,300
Don.

1218
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,640
But I didn't know what it meant.

1219
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,240
At all.

1220
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,560
Now I know what it means.

1221
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,060
It means I'm gonna take your tile.

1222
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,340
In the upper left corner, there are five tiles.

1223
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,340
But only one is revealed.

1224
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,580
Isn't that strange?

1225
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,680
I knew yaku, but I didn't know what it meant.

1226
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,980
Michi is the best because you don't have to do anything.

1227
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,560
Once you're in that state.

1228
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,060
Oh...

1229
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,080
Yeah, no Niko's win by...

1230
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,960
stealing the tile.

1231
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:27,720
So...

1232
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,420
I have a question.

1233
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,360
Can you only...

1234
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,360
Don if you're in the...

1235
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,760
What was that?

1236
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,460
What was that state called?

1237
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:39,920
Tenpai?

1238
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,940
Yes, you need to beat Tenpai.

1239
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,340
Okay.

1240
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,380
I'm gonna write that down.

1241
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,920
Can only Don...

1242
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,220
tile from...

1243
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,180
another person...

1244
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,000
win in Tenpai?

1245
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,280
I need one more tile...

1246
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:58,660
to win.

1247
00:51:58,860 --> 00:51:59,400
Okay.

1248
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,480
My notes.

1249
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,600
My notes, my notes, my notes.

1250
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,100
If not, it's just a Pon.

1251
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,260
Or Chi.

1252
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,060
Okay.

1253
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,920
If not, it's Pon or Chi.

1254
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,440
Wait, okay.

1255
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,320
So Chi is...

1256
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,820
taking from the left.

1257
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:19,860
From...

1258
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,260
person on left.

1259
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,140
What was a Pon again?

1260
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:25,960
I don't remember.

1261
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:28,820
Wait.

1262
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,380
The game will let you make...

1263
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:31,880
wrong calls.

1264
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:32,280
That's okay.

1265
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,420
Being in Tenpai is like Uno...

1266
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,220
in Uno.

1267
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:38,580
How?

1268
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,580
Okay, okay, okay.

1269
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,180
Pon is for calling triplets.

1270
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,540
Ah, okay.

1271
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,120
Pon...

1272
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,500
for calling...

1273
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:49,920
triplets.

1274
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,220
When you have...

1275
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,800
two of a tile and someone discards the third.

1276
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:55,680
Okay, okay.

1277
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,440
Okay, thank you.

1278
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,460
Taking...

1279
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:07,620
Okay.

1280
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:07,980
Okay!

1281
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,820
And Chi is for taking...

1282
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,000
from the person...

1283
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,260
The Chi is for sequence.

1284
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,420
But only for the...

1285
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,420
Taking from the person on the left.

1286
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,440
But only for sequence.

1287
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,060
So you can't do Chi for...

1288
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,460
Okay, so if I take from the person on my left...

1289
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,520
and it's for a triplet, it would just be a Pon.

1290
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:29,570
Chi is for sequence.

1291
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,790
And you can only take from the person before you.

1292
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:33,590
Pon is for triplets.

1293
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,690
You can take from anyone.

1294
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:36,870
Ah, okay, okay.

1295
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,370
You don't have to worry about the left side thing...

1296
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,430
in this since it won't let you.

1297
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:48,070
But it's still good to know in case I play...

1298
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:49,990
outside of...

1299
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:51,570
Mahjong Soul, right?

1300
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:53,510
So...

1301
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,490
It's gonna be confusing...

1302
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,030
at first.

1303
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:00,410
Yeah, but that's okay.

1304
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,370
I think I'm already...

1305
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:02,590
understanding...

1306
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:03,330
slowly.

1307
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:05,970
I'm getting...

1308
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,390
I'm knowing...

1309
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:09,050
I'm understanding...

1310
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:13,150
better than I did before when I tried.

1311
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,530
The best advice I have about Mahjong...

1312
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:19,690
is to avoid calling tiles until you recognize...

1313
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:20,630
the Yaku...

1314
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:21,710
that you're building.

1315
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,190
Wait, what do you mean by calling tiles?

1316
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,130
By putting them over here...

1317
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,570
on the right side of me?

1318
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:29,490
Over here?

1319
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:32,210
Good advice.

1320
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:34,470
By calling...

1321
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,730
Okay, okay, okay.

1322
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:43,110
Okay, I'm gonna write that down.

1323
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:45,590
Calling tiles...

1324
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,470
equals taking tiles.

1325
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:48,950
Stealing tiles.

1326
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,210
Becoming...

1327
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:52,470
a criminal...

1328
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:53,770
of tiles.

1329
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,470
Okay, cool.

1330
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,430
So, in that regard...

1331
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,990
it feels like poker.

1332
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:03,230
Aren't you supposed to hide your hand...

1333
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,270
in poker for so long?

1334
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,050
Crimes.

1335
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:09,530
Crimes!

1336
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:11,150
I didn't know so many...

1337
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:12,650
Vtuber fans knew how to play Mahjong.

1338
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,250
I've always been...

1339
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,190
so fascinated when I go to...

1340
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,190
like an anime convention because there's...

1341
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,370
without doubt, always a group of...

1342
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,930
people that are just playing Mahjong.

1343
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:24,570
Like somewhere on the floor.

1344
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:27,590
So...

1345
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,270
I've always been...

1346
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:30,770
so fascinated to try...

1347
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:32,010
and learn how to play.

1348
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,530
Because it seems fun.

1349
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:36,230
If it's so fun that...

1350
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,230
there's people that are just like...

1351
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,610
sitting around playing Mahjong.

1352
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,590
There are at least four of us.

1353
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:47,790
I've never seen that.

1354
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:48,250
That's crazy.

1355
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:48,910
Really?

1356
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,770
I feel like I've always seen it.

1357
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:54,850
I have a set I bring to furry cons.

1358
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,050
No way!

1359
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,370
How do you hold them in your furry paws?

1360
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:02,890
This is where mind games come in.

1361
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,090
If you're calling tiles, it also makes it more likely...

1362
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,790
to let the other players figure out what hand you have.

1363
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:07,430
Yeah!

1364
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,970
That's where, like I said, where it feels like poker.

1365
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:10,990
Also, hi, Emily!

1366
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:16,510
Oh god.

1367
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:20,050
I should watch Saki.

1368
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:21,110
I should finish Saki.

1369
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,430
I saw a group of...

1370
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:25,410
Zombieland Saga cosplayers playing Mahjong.

1371
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:26,930
Okay.

1372
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:28,330
This is the Dora.

1373
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:28,870
Oh my gosh!

1374
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:30,330
D-d-d-d-d-d-dora!

1375
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:32,410
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-dora!

1376
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,290
Dora, Dora, Dora!

1377
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,390
She's a gambler!

1378
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:36,170
Dora!

1379
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:39,070
Oh my god, she got into Mahjong!

1380
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:39,890
Dora!

1381
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:41,290
Oh my god, boots!

1382
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:44,970
She sold boots off to pay off her debts!

1383
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:46,930
Dora the Mahjong...

1384
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,330
Dora the Mahjong...

1385
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,070
Dora the Mahjong...

1386
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:54,470
Dora the gambler.

1387
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:58,590
They will indicate the shining Dora tile.

1388
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:00,150
The tiles...

1389
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:04,350
Wait, the tile next in order after the revealed indicator tile is Dora.

1390
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,290
If the one man is revealed...

1391
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:09,810
Oh, that scared me.

1392
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,910
Then the two man in your hand is Dora.

1393
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:13,870
Huh?

1394
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:19,050
Swiper knows so I pick credit cards.

1395
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:22,130
Wait, what?

1396
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,980
Soy gambler!

1397
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:32,760
Hola!

1398
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,400
Okay, this confused me the most.

1399
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,500
Shiny tiles equals more points, basically.

1400
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,060
Okay.

1401
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,600
Dora is the next tile from the revealed tile.

1402
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:49,460
Okay.

1403
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,260
Shiny tiles equals bonus points.

1404
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,040
Ah!

1405
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,760
So if I have...

1406
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,610
But this one's shiny.

1407
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:02,910
Two.

1408
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,550
The tile next in order after the revealed...

1409
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:13,110
Oh, so because this is revealed, then this would be the shiny, the Dora.

1410
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:17,550
Sorry, not the...

1411
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:18,910
It's Dora.

1412
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:20,670
Okay, okay, okay.

1413
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:23,970
Is it just in my hand or...

1414
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:31,530
So if you're like trying to really big brain it, you would want to get like a sequence with the Dora...

1415
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:36,510
With Dora or like a triplet Dora or something like that.

1416
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,070
Dora's are for everyone.

1417
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:39,270
Okay.

1418
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:42,250
So if one is revealed, then two is Dora.

1419
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:42,570
Ah!

1420
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:45,030
Okay, okay, okay.

1421
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:47,870
The more Dora, the better.

1422
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:49,310
Yummy points.

1423
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:51,170
Okay, okay, okay.

1424
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,670
You guys are so helpful today.

1425
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:54,370
Oh my gosh.

1426
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:55,970
Thank you guys.

1427
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:01,890
When you win, the more Dora tiles you have in your hand, the more points you win.

1428
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,330
Oh, I didn't even...

1429
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:08,150
It's not even letting me put anything down.

1430
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:11,210
It's like you're still too stupid, okay?

1431
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:12,810
Oh, another Yaku.

1432
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,910
Another Yaku is Ritchie.

1433
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:17,130
Ritchie.

1434
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:19,410
Ritchie.

1435
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:19,610
Okay.

1436
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:23,910
When Ritchie is possible, the following button will appear.

1437
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:28,070
You need to pay 1,000 points as Ritchie bet.

1438
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:30,750
Ritchie is best Yaku.

1439
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:31,430
Ritchie is best Yaku.

1440
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:38,950
Okay, when you have neither all symbols nor triplet of prevalent seat wind, what can you do?

1441
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:42,170
Since we haven't called T or Pon yet, we can call BT.

1442
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,330
It's also a very common Yaku.

1443
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:51,150
Okay, so I don't have all symbols

1444
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,000
nor triplet of...

1445
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:00,600
Okay.

1446
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,240
Okay.

1447
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,260
It's the lock-in button.

1448
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:11,380
When Ritchie is possible, the following button will appear.

1449
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,000
Wait, call is not allowed.

1450
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:18,820
Because this is the triplet of the prevalent or seat wind.

1451
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:23,640
Because it's east wind and I'm sitting west.

1452
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,480
Right?

1453
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,260
So...

1454
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,060
That's why I can't call the Ritchie.

1455
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,860
Because I have to have neither all symbols

1456
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,080
nor triplet of prevalent seat wind.

1457
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,840
The Ritchie button is so satisfying to press.

1458
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,160
Once you're Ritchie, you can't T or Pon...

1459
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,100
Or what?

1460
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,120
Magi, was you right?

1461
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:58,070
Hello, my favorite vegetable introduced me to your lives and I'm enjoying it.

1462
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:02,110
Can you send a hug to Lucas for me?

1463
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:02,570
Please.

1464
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:03,710
Hugs from Brazil.

1465
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:04,750
Thanks, Roy.

1466
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:06,310
Hi, Lucas.

1467
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:09,030
If you feel a chill, it's me.

1468
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:12,790
Thank you.

1469
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,010
The game will play itself once you go into Ritchie.

1470
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:16,550
Oh, really?

1471
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:17,010
Okay.

1472
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,090
I'm just gonna keep going.

1473
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:23,290
Tap the Ritchie button, pay 1000 points as Ritchie bet and discard a tile to make your hand Tenpai.

1474
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:25,450
Okay.

1475
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:26,210
So hold on.

1476
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,370
Let's see why this makes it Tenpai.

1477
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:30,610
So we have a sequence.

1478
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:31,510
One sequence.

1479
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:32,710
Two sequence.

1480
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,410
A triplet.

1481
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:37,210
Um...

1482
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,670
So, that's three.

1483
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:43,970
Thanks, Takizo!

1484
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:46,750
You can reach it as long as you haven't stolen any tiles that round.

1485
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,010
It doesn't have to be all simple.

1486
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:48,330
Oh!

1487
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:49,350
Okay, okay, okay.

1488
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,570
And then we have four pair.

1489
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:54,130
So, um...

1490
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,890
All we would need is another sequel.

1491
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,970
We didn't need a five or an eight, right?

1492
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:01,630
Hmm.

1493
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,110
So that's why we get rid of this.

1494
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:06,810
Okay.

1495
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,010
Ritchie-nya!

1496
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:10,090
Ritchie-nya!

1497
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:19,490
While paying 1000 points is a pain and you can't change your hand after calling Ritchie, you will have Ritchie as Yaku and you only need to draw a tile and discard it until you win!

1498
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,370
But I can't steal.

1499
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:25,690
So I have to be lucky.

1500
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:27,310
I win!

1501
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:28,510
Ippatsu-zuma!

1502
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:31,910
Okay.

1503
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:39,290
Ippatsu is a Yaku that comes into effect if the player wins within the next turn after declaring Ritchie, i.e.

1504
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:42,910
before their next discard, without interruptions from other players' calls.

1505
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:43,610
Oh my gosh.

1506
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:44,750
Friendinator!

1507
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:45,750
I think you're the Akasuba!

1508
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,090
It's dangerous to gacha without money.

1509
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:49,270
Here, take this.

1510
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:49,950
No!

1511
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:52,350
Thank you!

1512
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:55,290
Thank you so much.

1513
01:02:55,950 --> 01:03:01,250
As a reward for winning with Ritchie, you also get the chance to have another Dora coming into effect.

1514
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,570
Let's check out what the Uradora tile is.

1515
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:05,870
Tsumo.

1516
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:12,930
Hidden Dora.

1517
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:15,990
We had no...

1518
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:18,250
We had no hidden Dora though.

1519
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,690
Tsumo-nya!

1520
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,370
No Uradora.

1521
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:25,790
Too bad.

1522
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:28,190
Yippee!

1523
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:33,470
It's a pity we didn't have any Uradora tiles in our hand.

1524
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:38,270
But even like this, we win with bigger winning points since we have both Ritchie and Ippat.

1525
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:39,490
Okay.

1526
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,470
Congratulations on the win-nya!

1527
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:45,030
This is the end of today's...

1528
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:46,370
Okay.

1529
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:49,890
Okay, so Ippat...

1530
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:52,110
I didn't write anything for Ritchie.

1531
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:56,030
Wait, I wrote no notes for Ritchie.

1532
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:56,670
Okay.

1533
01:03:56,870 --> 01:04:01,070
Can call when you uh...

1534
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:07,610
haven't called Chie or Pon.

1535
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:09,570
Like,

1536
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,960
Ritchie is just click it if you see it.

1537
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,740
But like...

1538
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:21,920
And then Ippat is win after Ritchie.

1539
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:22,260
Thank you.

1540
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,580
Ippat win after...

1541
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:29,140
Win right after calling Ritchie.

1542
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,520
But...

1543
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,380
And all...

1544
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,280
No all-samples or wins.

1545
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,340
And...

1546
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,920
No all-samples or wins.

1547
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:41,240
No all-samples or wins.

1548
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,400
So...

1549
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,380
I'm kind of confused.

1550
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,340
What's like the...

1551
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,600
What's like the benefit of calling Ritchie?

1552
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,280
Oh, it's just a Yaku.

1553
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,880
Ritchie is riskier but worth more points.

1554
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:02,800
Ritchie is riskier but worth more points.

1555
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,500
Okay, okay, okay.

1556
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,140
You don't need any other Yaku.

1557
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,730
You don't need any other Yaku.

1558
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:22,710
More Yaku is more points, so it can stack.

1559
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:23,590
Oh...

1560
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:30,880
Ritchie is a Yaku easy to get because game is called Ritchie Majong.

1561
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,040
I see.

1562
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,300
If you win with Ritchie, you'll be rich.

1563
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:41,680
A friend...

1564
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,320
My friend asked me how much I had to get you to play Majong.

1565
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:48,840
I'm so glad my Kamiyoshi is finally playing one of my favorite games.

1566
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:48,840
Nice!

1567
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:50,800
Thanks, Nicholas!

1568
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,700
Help me out, then.

1569
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:55,980
Thank you.

1570
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,840
You can only get Uradora... Oh, okay.

1571
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,400
Only...

1572
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:11,260
You can only get Uradora if you win with Ritchie.

1573
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,120
Let me write.

1574
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:22,260
Uradora equals bonus point shiny special tile.

1575
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:32,080
You can ignore all other Yaku, so very beginner friendly.

1576
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,300
Okay.

1577
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,220
You're a certified grandma now after this?

1578
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:41,540
I still have... I still have one more chapter.

1579
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,100
And then I got to...

1580
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,280
I got to do the test, which I'm really scared for.

1581
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:49,180
Okay.

1582
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,500
Oh, you're awake!

1583
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:54,860
Did I die?

1584
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,880
I have played the game halfway for you, nya.

1585
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:59,040
Check out your hand.

1586
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,740
We have so many man-tiles, nya.

1587
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,440
Sorry, this hand looks a bit weird.

1588
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:06,580
Okay.

1589
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:09,920
Simply Yaku half flush.

1590
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,400
Is this the...

1591
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,880
Wait, what was it called?

1592
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:17,620
Like a...

1593
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,520
Honnitsu.

1594
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,300
She's sabotaging you.

1595
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,820
I'm afraid it's been nine years.

1596
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,640
Look at your arm.

1597
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,200
No!

1598
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,080
No!

1599
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,120
Bro, if these are simple, what's a complex Yaku?

1600
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,440
For real though, right?

1601
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:52,740
Okay.

1602
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:59,820
May only contain numbered tiles of one suit and triplet or pair of honor tiles.

1603
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:00,440
Okay.

1604
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:14,520
Can only contain numbered tiles of one suit and triplet or pair of honor tiles.

1605
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:18,440
So the honor tiles are the...

1606
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:18,660
So the honor tiles are the...

1607
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:19,780
The...

1608
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:23,300
The dragon one, right?

1609
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,080
Right?

1610
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,460
Uh...

1611
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:28,520
Uh...

1612
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:31,720
Dragons wins.

1613
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,820
Wind and Dragons.

1614
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:33,220
Okay.

1615
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,380
Okay.

1616
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:41,740
Okay.

1617
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:42,340
Mmm.

1618
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:42,660
Mmm.

1619
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:42,880
Mmm.

1620
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,080
Mmm.

1621
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:51,540
While it is worth 300 after you make a call, the worth will be...

1622
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:51,560
You're...

1623
01:08:53,660 --> 01:09:00,860
Okay, this hand is aiming for a yaku called Half-Flash, where aside from honor tiles, all the numbered tiles belong to one suit.

1624
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:05,160
Currently, we're waiting for 1, 4, 7 man.

1625
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:09,660
Oh my gosh, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1626
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,600
Making this a very advantageous hand.

1627
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,740
But why are we waiting for the 1 or the 4 or the 7?

1628
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:20,640
Wait...

1629
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:30,450
13 orphans.

1630
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:31,510
Sounds scary.

1631
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:38,650
Oh, I can't... I'm looking at this like it's my hand.

1632
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:39,250
I'm a dummy.

1633
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:41,410
Sorry, sorry.

1634
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:42,510
Okay, yeah, you're right, you're right.

1635
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:43,850
We can't... okay, okay.

1636
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:46,790
Yes, down here.

1637
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:47,970
Down here is our hand.

1638
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:48,270
Okay.

1639
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,190
It's a meme hand, 13 orphans.

1640
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:57,070
But as we discarded the 1 man before, that means we are in Tempest.

1641
01:09:57,090 --> 01:10:01,870
Waiting for tiles including the one that was discarded before by ourselves.

1642
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:04,670
This status is called Discard Furiten.

1643
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,930
Okay, so yeah, we're waiting for 1.

1644
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:12,290
5, 6, 7...

1645
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:20,420
When 1 is in Furiten, they can only win by Tsumo.

1646
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:21,600
Okay, hold on.

1647
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:27,260
When in Furiten, you can only win by Tsumo.

1648
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:36,830
And not Ron.

1649
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:45,410
Calling on another player's Discard.

1650
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:56,170
I'm just... I feel like, you know when you take notes from a class and you just type exactly what was written on the PowerPoint that the teacher had on the board?

1651
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:57,370
That's how I feel right now.

1652
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:00,890
Furiten is bad, basically.

1653
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:12,190
Okay, aside from Discard Furiten, there are also 2 other types of Furiten called Temporary Furiten and Ditchi Furiten.

1654
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:14,150
But I won't go deep into these here.

1655
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:15,250
Thank you.

1656
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,470
Oh, goodbye.

1657
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,720
Girl, we can't wait for the other 3 players to discard any of the winning tiles on this situation.

1658
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,540
Try to draw the winning tile on your own.

1659
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:30,580
Believe in yourself.

1660
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,380
That's a win by Tsumo for you!

1661
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,100
Good job!

1662
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,580
Tsumo-nya!

1663
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,760
Tsumo-nya!

1664
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:51,250
Yippee!

1665
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:53,970
It's not like it was a tutorial or anything.

1666
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:04,810
So... so if I... if I were to have won by Ditchi...

1667
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:06,430
Wait... no.

1668
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:12,550
If I were to have gotten... used these... the soul... the soul tiles...

1669
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:17,430
The 3 soul tile would have been the Dora, right?

1670
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:19,750
Raiders?

1671
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:20,750
Hi Raiders!

1672
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:21,190
Hello!

1673
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:25,590
My name is Mint Phantom and right now my brain is leaking out my ears.

1674
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:26,210
Thank you!

1675
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:27,410
Thanks for the raid!

1676
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:29,450
Raymak, thanks for the 5 gifted!

1677
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:33,970
If you won by Ditchi, you would have gotten 1000 more points minimum.

1678
01:12:33,970 --> 01:12:36,730
And then we could have also maybe gotten the hidden Dora.

1679
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:45,390
My brain... I'm only playing this game because I like Blue Archive, you guys.

1680
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:50,910
Taki, thanks for the gifting!

1681
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:53,150
Thank you!

1682
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:57,010
3 soul would be the Dora, but not usable in your hand.

1683
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:57,470
No, no, no.

1684
01:12:58,270 --> 01:12:59,550
Not usable in my hand.

1685
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:01,150
Okay.

1686
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:03,630
That's why I was saying, if I had Ditchied...

1687
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:05,050
Then that would have been... I'm just...

1688
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:08,390
Applying what I learned in the last episode.

1689
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:10,830
Okay...

1690
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,630
Murphy, thanks for the 5 gifted thing!

1691
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:14,390
Money!

1692
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:17,030
Okay, let's go over what we learned.

1693
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:19,870
Oh, hi there, new player.

1694
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,190
My name is Ichihime.

1695
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:22,490
Never played Mahjong before?

1696
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:23,970
Oh well, let me teach you then.

1697
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:26,870
Okay.

1698
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:28,030
34 different tiles.

1699
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:29,470
So we have the Man.

1700
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:31,610
We have the Pin.

1701
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:32,930
We have Soul.

1702
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:33,770
Let's see if I remember.

1703
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:34,290
Man.

1704
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:37,550
1 man, 2 man, 3 man, 4 man.

1705
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:38,230
Okay.

1706
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:39,330
We have Pin.

1707
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:40,830
Which Pin will...

1708
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:43,190
Miss Mel-chan, thank you for the 5 gift!

1709
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:46,270
Thank you!

1710
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:51,650
If you don't memorize the numbers slash wins, everyone will think you're a scrub.

1711
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:52,410
I am a scrub!

1712
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:53,830
I am a scrub!

1713
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:54,990
I don't know what I'm doing!

1714
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:58,810
So, 1 man, 2 man, 3 man.

1715
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:00,050
Then you have the Pin Whales.

1716
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:01,930
Then you have the So Tall Bamboo.

1717
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:03,330
Then you have the Wins.

1718
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:05,290
Because Win goes in East direction.

1719
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:06,470
Win goes in South direction.

1720
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:07,370
Win goes in West direction.

1721
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:08,270
Win goes in North direction.

1722
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:09,490
Then you have the Dragons.

1723
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:10,430
The Dragon...

1724
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:12,170
There are 2 Dragons inside of me.

1725
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:13,250
Everybody understand?

1726
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:19,970
The objective of Mahjong is to win, of course.

1727
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:21,190
So how do you win a game?

1728
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:24,370
In a game, each player usually has 13 tiles in hand.

1729
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:26,470
No.

1730
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,170
But there are 3 Dragons.

1731
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,920
There are 3 Dragons inside of me.

1732
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:41,840
There's...

1733
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:42,660
There's...

1734
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:42,820
No.

1735
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,100
Okay.

1736
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:43,700
This is what...

1737
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:43,900
See.

1738
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,000
This is the kind...

1739
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:45,520
This is the...

1740
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,160
This is Naka.

1741
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,120
So inside.

1742
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,600
So then you have the Dragon.

1743
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:50,960
And then you have the...

1744
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,300
Who?

1745
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:52,820
Dragon.

1746
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,140
Is it weird that I'm kind of super invested in you learning Mahjong now?

1747
01:14:59,180 --> 01:14:59,760
You have...

1748
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,000
Then you have...

1749
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,420
Who?

1750
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:03,180
Who?

1751
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:04,400
Who is...

1752
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,040
Who is that?

1753
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:05,560
I mean...

1754
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:09,540
Nice memorization.

1755
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,440
Thank you.

1756
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,160
Discard the Dragon you don't want.

1757
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:20,780
Oh, sorry.

1758
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:21,240
Not the Dragon.

1759
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:23,620
Discard the card you don't want.

1760
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,680
And we have to get certain conditions.

1761
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,080
In every turn, you will draw a tile.

1762
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,700
So the number of tiles becomes 14.

1763
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:33,640
And you shall discard one from your hand.

1764
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,520
Why am I yawning?

1765
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:35,280
I had coffee.

1766
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:37,680
We have to...

1767
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:37,920
Okay.

1768
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:40,080
Before explaining how to win, first understand 3 terms.

1769
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:40,760
Sequences.

1770
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,400
Triplets and pairs.

1771
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:44,500
First we have pairs.

1772
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,500
Two identical.

1773
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,660
Then we have triplets.

1774
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:48,680
Three identical.

1775
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:49,960
And then we have a sequence.

1776
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,280
Three consecutive tiles of the same group.

1777
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,280
Easy peasy.

1778
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:53,720
This one...

1779
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,300
This part's easy.

1780
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,440
This part's easy.

1781
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,340
Yeah.

1782
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,220
5, 6, 7.

1783
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,660
So tall bamboos.

1784
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:00,400
7, 8, 9.

1785
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:01,920
People...

1786
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:02,340
Oh.

1787
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,040
7, 8, 9 people.

1788
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,080
That's a lot of people to eat.

1789
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,860
And then 4, 5, 6.

1790
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:08,600
Pinwheels.

1791
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:10,740
Pinwheels.

1792
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:16,420
Usually when your hand consists of 4 sequences or triplets plus 1 pair, you are ready to win, master.

1793
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,380
Of course.

1794
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,540
In Meetsy Mahjong, you must satisfy other conditions to declare a win.

1795
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:21,620
We will cover them later.

1796
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:33,120
So we have to get 4 sequences or triplets, so we can have 1 sequence, 3 triplets, 2 triplets, 2 sequences.

1797
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,560
But we also need a pair.

1798
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,660
And other conditions.

1799
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,840
This is the most important sign.

1800
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:47,100
Yeah.

1801
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:55,540
You can also do 4 sequences or 4 triplets.

1802
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:55,920
Yes.

1803
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,240
You can do 4 sequences or 4 triplets.

1804
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,560
Yes.

1805
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,640
Thank you.

1806
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:01,920
Yes.

1807
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:02,840
Yeah.

1808
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,320
The other conditions are the yaku.

1809
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,620
So there's...

1810
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,340
So far, I know 4 different yaku.

1811
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:08,640
4 yaku.

1812
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:11,360
5 yaku.

1813
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,500
Of course your hand also often consist of 13 tiles only.

1814
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:20,420
So, you need 1 more to win.

1815
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,920
When you just need 1 more tile to win, this hand is called Tenpai.

1816
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:27,560
Tenpai is a necessary step before winning.

1817
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,220
So make sure you pay attention to it.

1818
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,960
So the...

1819
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,520
So if we have 4, 5...

1820
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,020
If we get 6, then we would win.

1821
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,020
Because we would have these 3 sequences.

1822
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,160
Triplets.

1823
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,640
And this would make another...

1824
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,680
Or we could get a 3.

1825
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,320
We could get a 3 or a 6.

1826
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,320
And then that would be the pair.

1827
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:56,360
My favorite yaku are all pairs.

1828
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,320
Easy to remember.

1829
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,460
That does sound easy.

1830
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,040
Okay.

1831
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:03,780
That's correct.

1832
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,740
7 pairs is a yaku too.

1833
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,200
Yes.

1834
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,440
Wait.

1835
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,460
7 pairs?

1836
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:15,020
Really?

1837
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:19,960
Did I learn that one?

1838
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:27,790
It's also a meme hand?

1839
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,470
You can make 7 pairs.

1840
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:31,610
7 pairs is bad!

1841
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:38,410
Which tile does the hand need for winning?

1842
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:39,010
Oh!

1843
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:40,450
Let's see.

1844
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:41,030
We got...

1845
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:42,790
We have a pair here.

1846
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:44,090
Of 2s.

1847
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:45,070
4, 5, 6.

1848
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:45,770
We have a sequence.

1849
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:48,870
3, 4.

1850
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:50,850
Probably this 2, right?

1851
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:53,810
1 sequence.

1852
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:55,550
2 sequence.

1853
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:56,790
3 sequence.

1854
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:57,670
2!

1855
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:00,270
Correct!

1856
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:05,770
Statistically speaking, you're close to 7 pairs once you have 5 in your hand.

1857
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:17,310
Which tile does the hand need for winning?

1858
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:18,090
Okay.

1859
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:22,910
Oh shoot.

1860
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:27,310
This would be our pair.

1861
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:28,770
Right?

1862
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:29,370
Yeah.

1863
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:31,590
We need the 3 because we need the pair.

1864
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:32,230
Right?

1865
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:35,610
Yippee!

1866
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:39,150
Yeah!

1867
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:40,170
Okay.

1868
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:44,370
Okay.

1869
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:50,840
Wait.

1870
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:53,780
Am I dumb?

1871
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:56,140
We don't have...

1872
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:56,240
Wait.

1873
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,420
Actually, I don't understand.

1874
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:07,740
No, you're smart.

1875
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:12,200
Oh!

1876
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:14,500
It turns this one into a pair and then 1, 2...

1877
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:15,500
3!

1878
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:16,980
3!

1879
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:17,000
Oh!

1880
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,540
This is the pair.

1881
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,300
I was like...

1882
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,660
I knew that.

1883
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:28,660
The whole time.

1884
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,380
I knew that the whole time...

1885
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:34,900
She failed successfully.

1886
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:42,410
Mmm mmm mmm!

1887
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:42,850
Mmm mmm mmm.

1888
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:45,830
Let's see the other pair.

1889
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:45,950
The other pair is...

1890
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:52,810
A winning hand must contain a yaku.

1891
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:57,090
If you achieve 10-5 of no-yaku, a no-yaku notice will be shown.

1892
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:58,250
That's so scary!

1893
01:20:58,410 --> 01:20:59,110
That sounds so scary.

1894
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:01,790
Simple yaku.

1895
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:02,650
Yakuhai.

1896
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:07,870
You know, I don't think I wrote these.

1897
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:11,210
Yakuhai.

1898
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:12,410
Which yaku I'm doing.

1899
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:16,350
So this is the one where you refer to the...

1900
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,890
Oh wait, no.

1901
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:19,650
Yeah, this is the one with...

1902
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:20,770
Yakuhai.

1903
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:28,550
The triplets of the prevalent wind or the seat wind.

1904
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:31,290
Or the dragon... yeah, yeah, yeah.

1905
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,780
Three dragon tiles or... yeah, or the dragon tiles.

1906
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:52,390
Yakuhai equals three dragons, your seat wind, east wind.

1907
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:53,930
Okay.

1908
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,210
All simples.

1909
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:00,890
Oops, all simples.

1910
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,330
Okay, yes, this is the... okay, all simples.

1911
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:07,790
Oops.

1912
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:08,910
Oops, all simples.

1913
01:22:09,790 --> 01:22:10,650
No-yaku.

1914
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:12,590
No-yaku.

1915
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,640
There's some yaku cheat sheets you can look up for quick reference.

1916
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:25,020
You might need it because I'm writing all this down, but I'm more of a visual person than anything else, so...

1917
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:29,440
Writing it down might be completely pointless for me.

1918
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,320
You must not have any of the tiles below, which is one and nine.

1919
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:42,020
Or any of the winds or any of the dragons.

1920
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:46,240
Okay.

1921
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,160
Niichi.

1922
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,660
When Niichi is possible, the following button will appear.

1923
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:53,600
And then I have to pay a thousand points.

1924
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,440
When you achieve tenpai without calling chi, pon, or kan.

1925
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,620
Yes.

1926
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:01,200
Oh wait, I didn't write kan.

1927
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:04,040
I'm going to call chi or pon or kan.

1928
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,140
And no simple... wait.

1929
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:15,150
Wait, is it no... no all-simples or winds?

1930
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:19,770
Oh wait, so it's got to be no all-simples and no all-winds, right?

1931
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:24,750
Close kan from your own hand is allowed.

1932
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:26,010
Oh, let me write that down too.

1933
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:27,690
Close kan.

1934
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:33,670
You can have all-simples or winds.

1935
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:34,030
You can!

1936
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:35,490
Okay, I wrote that down.

1937
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:36,290
Maybe I misunderstood.

1938
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:40,310
Okay.

1939
01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:42,770
Doesn't matter what you have in your hand.

1940
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:43,810
Okay, okay, okay.

1941
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:47,570
All-winds is a billion points since it's giga rare.

1942
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:50,670
Are you winning, Minto?

1943
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:52,210
I don't know.

1944
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,980
Ritchie lets you win even if you don't have anything else.

1945
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:08,320
Okay.

1946
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,760
Going on a trip, so I can't watch the stream.

1947
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,660
We'll watch the VOD later.

1948
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,800
Have fun wrecking your brain in mahjong.

1949
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:16,400
It ate all my brain cells when I played it.

1950
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:17,080
Thanks, Mason!

1951
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:18,020
Thank you.

1952
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,360
Which of the following sequence is a yaku?

1953
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:25,400
Yaku?

1954
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:26,540
East?

1955
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:30,800
East?

1956
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,100
It's an east game and we're east seat.

1957
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,060
So, east.

1958
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:35,600
Correct!

1959
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:39,420
Nice.

1960
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,120
Which tile should you discard if you want to achieve...

1961
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:47,520
Tanyao?

1962
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,260
For all-simples, you must not have any...

1963
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,040
Oh, wait.

1964
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,360
We can't have the one.

1965
01:24:59,280 --> 01:24:59,800
Correct!

1966
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,800
I wish they wouldn't switch between the terminology.

1967
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:13,620
Either call it all-simples forever or call it Tanyao forever.

1968
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:14,780
You know what I mean?

1969
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:16,920
Or at least always put like...

1970
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:20,560
Like Tanyao, parenthesis, simples.

1971
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:29,340
Now that we have learned the tiles and some yaku, let's check out the game interface.

1972
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,980
Master, please look at the screen above.

1973
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:33,960
I shall explain to you one by one.

1974
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:40,360
East 1 means that you are the first game of the east wind round.

1975
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:43,020
East is your current round wind.

1976
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,240
67 means the tiles remaining.

1977
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:50,520
My points?

1978
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:53,740
Discard tiles?

1979
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,880
Discard tiles you don't want.

1980
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,500
Or tiles you don't want.

1981
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:01,520
You can call the discard tiles for T-ponkan.

1982
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:06,040
T is the call to complete a sequence.

1983
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:12,240
Chi is when...

1984
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,640
Hold on.

1985
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:26,000
Chi is when I call from the person on my left for the sequence.

1986
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:33,460
Chi is a yoink for sequence.

1987
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:33,800
Correct?

1988
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:34,880
Yippee!

1989
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:45,390
Okay.

1990
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:49,550
So yeah.

1991
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:49,910
Okay.

1992
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:52,150
Last player left side.

1993
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:53,310
Discard a tile from...

1994
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:54,790
Form a sequence with two tiles.

1995
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:55,130
So...

1996
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:56,590
6...

1997
01:26:57,870 --> 01:26:58,350
8...

1998
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:59,590
And they drop to 7.

1999
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:04,990
Here the 7-pin discarded by the last player can be used to form a sequence of...

2000
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:05,930
6, 7, 8-pin.

2001
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:06,810
Yes.

2002
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:09,330
Pon...

2003
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:10,710
Is when anybody...

2004
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,550
Pon is when somebody...

2005
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:13,450
Anybody...

2006
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:15,570
Places a tile...

2007
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:16,630
Discards a tile...

2008
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:17,890
That I want to steal.

2009
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,150
And I go...

2010
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:19,690
Steal!

2011
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:21,370
And then I take it...

2012
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:22,470
For...

2013
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:22,990
Uh...

2014
01:27:22,990 --> 01:27:23,630
Okay.

2015
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:24,230
For...

2016
01:27:25,090 --> 01:27:25,690
For...

2017
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:26,750
Triplet.

2018
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:35,450
Steal!

2019
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:36,810
Yoink!

2020
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:38,570
Hey guys.

2021
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,510
I'm here in the Florida Everglades.

2022
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:40,930
Oh look!

2023
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:42,210
A shiny spider.

2024
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:43,050
Yoink!

2025
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:44,450
A shiny tile.

2026
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:45,290
Yoink!

2027
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:47,770
Full on Konosuba steel.

2028
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:48,650
Yeah.

2029
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:53,990
The steel just like the fear.

2030
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:56,850
Hai.

2031
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:58,010
Hai desu.

2032
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:58,650
Hai.

2033
01:27:58,850 --> 01:27:59,850
Minto desu.

2034
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,750
Are you guys watching Konosuba?

2035
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:04,050
The season 2?

2036
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:08,010
Um...

2037
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:08,950
Yes.

2038
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:09,430
Okay.

2039
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:10,570
So that's to make the triplet.

2040
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:10,850
Pon.

2041
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:13,570
This is the call to complete a quad.

2042
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:14,430
Kan can be...

2043
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:17,030
Called on discarded tiles from any player.

2044
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:21,150
Can also make a Kan call when you have 4 identical tiles in your hand.

2045
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:21,810
Or have...

2046
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:24,170
Has a previously melded triplet.

2047
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:33,890
Season 3.

2048
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:34,350
Wait.

2049
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:34,910
What did I say?

2050
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:38,390
Wait.

2051
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:38,910
What did I...

2052
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:39,210
Did I...

2053
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:39,810
What did I say?

2054
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,240
People were...

2055
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:45,480
Oh.

2056
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,260
Did I say season 2?

2057
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:46,480
Oh.

2058
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:46,700
My bad.

2059
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:46,920
Yeah.

2060
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:47,600
I meant season 3.

2061
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:50,820
My bad.

2062
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:51,120
My bad.

2063
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:51,720
Okay.

2064
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:52,520
Okay.

2065
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:53,900
So...

2066
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,980
People were saying that Kan is not so great.

2067
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:57,160
People...

2068
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,100
Is this one...

2069
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,020
Kind of...

2070
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,420
Only used...

2071
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:00,920
If...

2072
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:01,340
I...

2073
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:01,780
Am...

2074
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:02,760
Desperate?

2075
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:10,570
Oh.

2076
01:29:10,690 --> 01:29:10,950
Yes.

2077
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:11,610
I meant...

2078
01:29:11,610 --> 01:29:12,530
This season...

2079
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:12,830
Yes.

2080
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:13,470
Season...

2081
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:16,470
I was like...

2082
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:17,810
I don't think I said which season...

2083
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:19,450
Which season number it was.

2084
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:20,690
So...

2085
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:21,550
Yes.

2086
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:22,110
I was meaning...

2087
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:22,690
I was saying like...

2088
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:25,170
Are you watching it this season 2?

2089
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:26,050
As in...

2090
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:27,490
Are you watching it this season...

2091
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:28,330
As well?

2092
01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:32,550
Kan reveals more Dora.

2093
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:32,930
Oh.

2094
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:33,790
Does it?

2095
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:36,350
This calls to complete a quad.

2096
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:36,770
Okay.

2097
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:37,030
Hold on.

2098
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:37,730
Let me write...

2099
01:29:37,730 --> 01:29:38,250
Kan.

2100
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:41,110
I don't think I wrote Kan down.

2101
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:49,440
Kan...

2102
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,020
Equals...

2103
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:53,180
Calling...

2104
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:55,340
To complete a quad.

2105
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,580
It can be called on discarded tiles from any player.

2106
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,860
You can also make a Kan call when you have four cards.

2107
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:04,560
That's the closed Kan, right?

2108
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:08,240
If I call it on the ones that are in my hand?

2109
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,260
It's bad at higher expert play.

2110
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:15,880
It's fine at lower mid-level play.

2111
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:16,120
Oh.

2112
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:16,620
Okay.

2113
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:16,860
Okay.

2114
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:21,180
Kan will reveal more Dora, which might give your opponent an advantage too.

2115
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:21,880
Okay.

2116
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:22,180
Okay.

2117
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:24,220
Closed Kan is best for you.

2118
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:24,620
Mm.

2119
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:25,100
Mm.

2120
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:25,360
Mm.

2121
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:32,310
Oh.

2122
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:32,610
Oh.

2123
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:33,030
When...

2124
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,620
Identical tiles in the deck.

2125
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:51,240
You can either draw a card in your hand or have a previously melded triplet and then draw the fourth tile.

2126
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:51,600
Oh!

2127
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:52,740
Interesting.

2128
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:53,340
Okay.

2129
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:55,400
Okay.

2130
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:58,260
Okay.

2131
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:03,120
Learning the basic hand composition in the Yaku is a lot more simple than it seems at first.

2132
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:04,960
The real challenge is figuring out the scoring.

2133
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:11,380
It might help to watch Saki just so you can see all the Yakuman hands that you'll only get with MC luck.

2134
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:12,880
True.

2135
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:13,480
True.

2136
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:13,720
True.

2137
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:16,120
Kan is the Saki finisher.

2138
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:19,380
This is making me want to watch Saki though.

2139
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:26,420
Which of the following hands can Chi the sixth from the last player?

2140
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:28,820
Chi is...

2141
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:30,340
The...

2142
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,240
Oh my gosh.

2143
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:33,200
The sequence.

2144
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,220
So, it would be this one.

2145
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:38,380
Correct!

2146
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:39,700
Which snack do you...

2147
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:40,280
You want to have first?

2148
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,340
I'm not a snack!

2149
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:43,020
What are you talking about?

2150
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:46,640
Which of the following hands can Pon from another player?

2151
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:48,180
Pon is a triplet.

2152
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,000
So, this one.

2153
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:51,040
Yippee!

2154
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:56,220
Okay.

2155
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:57,640
Chi sequence.

2156
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,500
Pon triplet.

2157
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,620
Chi sequence.

2158
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:01,400
Pon triplet.

2159
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:02,180
Chi sequence.

2160
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:02,960
Pon triplet.

2161
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:03,780
Chi sequence.

2162
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:04,600
Pon triplet.

2163
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:04,920
Chi sequence.

2164
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:05,580
Chi sequence.

2165
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,440
Pon triplet.

2166
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:06,600
Pon triplet.

2167
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:09,700
Chi sequence.

2168
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,020
That's enough of the basic rules, master.

2169
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:13,520
Remember we have learned the tile groups.

2170
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:15,480
Man, Soul, Pin, Wind, and Dragon.

2171
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:16,940
Three simple yaku, yaku-hai.

2172
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:18,100
All simples in BT.

2173
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,080
The equation of winning.

2174
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:22,480
Four sequences or triplets plus one pair.

2175
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:27,220
You can practice your skills with AI by creating a private game room.

2176
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:32,420
Or if you are interested in more advanced rules, you can find them by tapping the question mark icon on the top right corner.

2177
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:33,780
I'm going to sleep now.

2178
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:38,320
We did it!

2179
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:41,880
Tutorial!

2180
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:43,080
Oh my gosh, I graduated.

2181
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:44,860
Look at my little hat.

2182
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:48,020
What does this do?

2183
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:49,360
Oh cute!

2184
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,700
That's so fun.

2185
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:02,000
Send help, I'm stuck in mahjong limbo.

2186
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:03,080
I can't get out of bronze.

2187
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,700
One of my most recent matches I lost in the first draw?

2188
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:10,220
Am I going to be okay?

2189
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,440
Okay, I think what I'm going to do...

2190
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:19,490
I think I should do gacha.

2191
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:22,590
And then I will play a game against the AI.

2192
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,890
I think I will do the gacha.

2193
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:29,590
And then I will play the game against the AI.

2194
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:44,830
How much is it to summon 10 times?

2195
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:47,250
Purchase... wait, I'm scared.

2196
01:33:47,610 --> 01:33:48,570
Is it going to show something?

2197
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:48,910
Hold on.

2198
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:50,490
I'm getting rid of the window real quick.

2199
01:33:51,170 --> 01:33:51,670
Oh, okay.

2200
01:33:54,530 --> 01:34:00,350
Do you know that in the manga Akagi, there was a single mahjong game that took 20 real life years to finish?

2201
01:34:00,950 --> 01:34:03,230
It was all a single night in the manga.

2202
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:06,010
20 years real life?

2203
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:08,410
It's like $40.

2204
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:09,150
Wait, what?

2205
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:10,530
Okay, hold on.

2206
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:11,750
How much is it?

2207
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:13,730
You need 1800.

2208
01:34:23,710 --> 01:34:24,990
That's really expensive.

2209
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:29,730
Check your mail for free stuff?

2210
01:34:31,790 --> 01:34:32,670
Where's my mail?

2211
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:33,390
Where's my mail?

2212
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:35,310
Do I have mail?

2213
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:38,470
I don't think I have mail.

2214
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:39,170
Oh, items maybe?

2215
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:41,530
Illustration?

2216
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:45,490
I got this one at least.

2217
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:45,830
Yippee!

2218
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:48,350
I don't think I have anything.

2219
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:50,330
Oh, under the event.

2220
01:34:58,370 --> 01:34:58,810
Mutsuki.

2221
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:06,270
Not this event.

2222
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:08,070
The button that says event.

2223
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:11,030
Oh, this one.

2224
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:17,660
I got 500 fest budget.

2225
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:28,920
I have nothing.

2226
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:34,720
I have nothing.

2227
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,640
No freebies.

2228
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,160
They don't even let you do a free 10 pull?

2229
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:46,600
They don't even let you do a free 10 pull.

2230
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:48,660
That's so sad.

2231
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,640
Oh my gosh, though.

2232
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:52,280
This is expensive.

2233
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,960
And what does it mean, first purchase?

2234
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,840
Oh, like the first purchase, I'll get the bonus, but usually I won't get the bonus?

2235
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:03,760
That's so messed up.

2236
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:14,180
Okay.

2237
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:17,660
We'll do two 10 pulls and see what happens.

2238
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:20,380
Is the gacha on this really stingy?

2239
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:21,340
Wait, oh.

2240
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,300
I don't think I have my wallet with me.

2241
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:25,940
I think I have to go get my purse.

2242
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,620
I have to go get my purse, you guys.

2243
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,660
Give me one second.

2244
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:32,520
I'm gonna go get it.

2245
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,420
Check the rates?

2246
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,340
Where does it say it?

2247
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:45,960
Oh my gosh.

2248
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:46,640
Good luck, man.

2249
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,360
Gacha Majang Soul is kind of brutal.

2250
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:48,900
Thanks!

2251
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:49,480
Oh my gosh.

2252
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:53,480
Thank you for the gacha fun and enjoyment.

2253
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,340
Thank you!

2254
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:58,350
Thank you so much!

2255
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:01,250
Wait, this artist...

2256
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:06,890
I recognize this artist.

2257
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:14,430
Isn't this Bizet's mama?

2258
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:16,890
Isn't this Bizet-sama's mama?

2259
01:37:17,870 --> 01:37:18,710
Fuzzy Choco!

2260
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:19,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2261
01:37:20,010 --> 01:37:21,890
I knew it, I knew it.

2262
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:25,130
I knew it, I knew it.

2263
01:37:27,070 --> 01:37:27,630
Okay.

2264
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:31,610
Pochimama is a character as well?

2265
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:32,950
Wait, can I identify it?

2266
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:38,350
Can I identify Pochimama's art?

2267
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:44,350
It's not this one, is it?

2268
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:47,190
Oh, it's Akasumi, right?

2269
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:59,870
Close but no cigar.

2270
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:03,010
It's not this one, is it?

2271
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:13,970
Second last row.

2272
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:14,410
Oops.

2273
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:18,090
Second last row...

2274
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:18,230
Oh!

2275
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:19,690
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

2276
01:38:20,950 --> 01:38:21,510
Oh!

2277
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:23,330
I didn't even see this one!

2278
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:24,090
Ah!

2279
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:25,550
The voice by Ho-chan!

2280
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:27,650
My name is Seira.

2281
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:29,690
I need your introduction.

2282
01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:31,070
Wait...

2283
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:32,010
I like it.

2284
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:33,890
This one!

2285
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:34,990
Wait...

2286
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:36,130
Wait...

2287
01:38:36,130 --> 01:38:37,070
I'm so confused.

2288
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:37,530
I was like...

2289
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:39,790
I was like, this doesn't look like...

2290
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:41,230
This doesn't look like...

2291
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:43,250
But it's Ho-chan, so it's okay.

2292
01:38:43,930 --> 01:38:44,770
I'm so confused.

2293
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:48,270
Wait...

2294
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:49,190
Ah!

2295
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:53,940
I...

2296
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:54,920
I see it now.

2297
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,160
I see it now.

2298
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,980
Immediately when I saw her, I was like...

2299
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,660
I see it...

2300
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:06,940
I saw it immediately.

2301
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:10,960
This artist also looks familiar.

2302
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:12,580
Hmm...

2303
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:14,320
Tange Sakura.

2304
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,800
Her name is Morikawa Ayako.

2305
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:21,220
There are so many cute characters!

2306
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:25,340
Gailamando!

2307
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:29,920
For gacha, you might want to hide your screen when clicking the jade to be safe.

2308
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:30,360
I will.

2309
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:30,760
I will.

2310
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:31,180
For sure.

2311
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:32,620
Thank you, though, for the reminder.

2312
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:35,380
Hmm...

2313
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:36,920
Looks familiar.

2314
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:37,840
Looks like Senran Kagura.

2315
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:38,260
This one?

2316
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:39,820
No...

2317
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:41,100
I don't know where.

2318
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:42,560
Looks familiar to me, though.

2319
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:53,880
Pochi-sensei always has like those very like...

2320
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:58,100
Very distinctive eyes, which is why I was like looking at these two.

2321
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:01,820
Because Pochi-sensei's eyes are always so sharp, you know what I mean?

2322
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:05,880
Hmm...

2323
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:07,200
Okay, let me go get my wallet.

2324
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,400
I'll be right back.

2325
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:12,040
I know where my purse is.

2326
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:12,980
I'll be right back.

2327
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:32,940
Okay, I'm back.

2328
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,560
I'm glad I have savings.

2329
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:42,620
Because...

2330
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:44,420
Um...

2331
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:47,720
PayPal has put a hold on all the money.

2332
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:49,300
So...

2333
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:49,980
I...

2334
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:52,660
I actually haven't had any...

2335
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:58,000
I haven't been able to get any of the money so far that you guys have donated.

2336
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:00,360
I won't be able to get it for three days.

2337
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:00,880
Three months.

2338
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:02,680
So...

2339
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:06,950
So...

2340
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:09,870
Um...

2341
01:41:09,870 --> 01:41:10,630
Credit card.

2342
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:14,950
Okay.

2343
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:17,650
I'm gonna hide my...

2344
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:18,670
Ta-da!

2345
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:21,650
Okay.

2346
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:22,330
Purchase.

2347
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:24,100
Um...

2348
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:25,670
I'm gonna get the 1800.

2349
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:27,850
Uh...

2350
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:30,550
It's not gonna like show my...

2351
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:32,390
Okay.

2352
01:41:32,450 --> 01:41:32,890
I'm scared.

2353
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:39,870
Okay.

2354
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:40,970
Put it in my credit card.

2355
01:41:42,030 --> 01:41:42,870
I'm definitely...

2356
01:41:42,870 --> 01:41:45,770
I'm like triple checking that I'm in my screen.

2357
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:50,190
Okay.

2358
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:53,490
Um...

2359
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:56,570
Warning.

2360
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:58,210
Do not open for three months.

2361
01:41:59,970 --> 01:42:00,490
Okay.

2362
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:02,530
I'm so scared.

2363
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:05,150
I don't think you guys can see but I'm still scared.

2364
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:06,490
I'll only...

2365
01:42:06,490 --> 01:42:07,390
I'll only unhide it.

2366
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:08,670
I'll only hide once we're back on the normal...

2367
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:09,010
The...

2368
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:10,030
The...

2369
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:10,790
The screen.

2370
01:42:16,650 --> 01:42:17,770
I'm scared.

2371
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:22,580
Okay.

2372
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:23,320
Pay.

2373
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:25,900
Close your eyes.

2374
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:26,340
Yeah.

2375
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:27,700
Close your eyes.

2376
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:31,440
Successfully purchased 1800 jade.

2377
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:32,600
Yippee!

2378
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:34,800
Okay.

2379
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:36,690
Close.

2380
01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:41,590
And...

2381
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:42,430
Ta-da!

2382
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:43,150
Okay.

2383
01:42:44,990 --> 01:42:45,810
Summon.

2384
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:46,030
Okay.

2385
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:46,390
Let's see.

2386
01:42:46,490 --> 01:42:46,690
I...

2387
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:50,250
I would really be happy with anybody.

2388
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:51,270
Truly.

2389
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:56,770
But if I were to rank them, I would want Shiroko Aru Hoshinomutsuki.

2390
01:42:58,630 --> 01:42:59,830
I shouldn't have said that.

2391
01:43:00,150 --> 01:43:01,310
I shouldn't have said that.

2392
01:43:01,490 --> 01:43:02,990
I just jinxed myself, didn't I?

2393
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:06,210
My offering to your gacha gods...

2394
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:06,450
Oh my god!

2395
01:43:06,490 --> 01:43:07,450
Dangisau noooo!

2396
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,000
Don't!

2397
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:13,800
Don't Sakastano please!

2398
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:15,620
Shiroko is so cute.

2399
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:16,060
She is!

2400
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:17,780
Clearly, the solution is Doraemon.

2401
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:20,820
Overload PayPal with money so it explodes the showers here with our donuts.

2402
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:21,220
No!

2403
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:24,440
No, no, no.

2404
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:27,500
Mutsuki at the bottom.

2405
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:27,860
Saj.

2406
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:29,020
It's because...

2407
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:33,100
Shinoko has to be at the top for me because she's my seiyuu-oshi.

2408
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:35,460
Thank you.

2409
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,580
Thank you guys for the Tsubas.

2410
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:40,360
I'm just taunting with this money at this point.

2411
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:43,280
Going for PayPal high scores.

2412
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:51,340
I'm requesting your professional opinion on Ichinose Asuna.

2413
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:52,260
Asuna?

2414
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,320
Like... Asuna Smile?

2415
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:56,780
I love Asuna.

2416
01:43:57,220 --> 01:44:00,240
My offering for the 3-month long Broke Ghost Raids...

2417
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:01,840
No!

2418
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:04,940
Got your tax, get that Aru.

2419
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:07,860
Yeah, the desire sensor has been activated so...

2420
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:09,500
Okay, I'm gonna... I'm not gonna look.

2421
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:10,920
I'm not gonna look.

2422
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,680
Wait, actually, how do I know if I got something good, right?

2423
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:16,520
Tap.

2424
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:18,660
Whoa!

2425
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:21,440
Whoa.

2426
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,260
I got a teddy bear.

2427
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,140
That's not a girl.

2428
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:24,940
Uh-oh.

2429
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:27,240
Purple streaks?

2430
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:29,020
Uh-oh.

2431
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:32,360
So this is not good.

2432
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:33,740
I got green streaks.

2433
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:36,900
Delicious cookie!

2434
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:38,400
What the hell is all this stuff?

2435
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:39,220
Where's the girls?

2436
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,100
Ooh, a lavender tablecloth though.

2437
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:44,460
Winning!

2438
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:45,620
Hard-boiled shot!

2439
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:47,880
What is this?

2440
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:48,520
It's wine glass.

2441
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:50,880
Oh my god, go to the mall stop for gacha.

2442
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:52,620
Hopefully you can get this sooner.

2443
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:54,460
Thank you, please.

2444
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:55,840
Guys, don't feel like you have to...

2445
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,320
Please, don't feel like you have to donate.

2446
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,460
Please, please, please.

2447
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:01,040
Serio... I'm dead serious, please.

2448
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:04,580
Especially if it's on gacha.

2449
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:06,500
Please, this is dumb purchases.

2450
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:07,460
Don't.

2451
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:10,220
Do not... Do not encourage this.

2452
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:14,300
But I'll cap it, like, maybe $100.

2453
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:16,040
Or two.

2454
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:19,480
Purple.

2455
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:21,340
Purple.

2456
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:22,960
Purple!

2457
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:24,180
Pyrobug, thank you!

2458
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,480
If you can read this, please give Mint money.

2459
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:27,000
Thank you.

2460
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:40,320
This is fine.

2461
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:43,580
This is fine.

2462
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,380
Normal dress.

2463
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,760
What are all the items for?

2464
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:50,960
Classic painting.

2465
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,240
But gosh, keyboard, thank you.

2466
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:58,100
Not encouragement, but yes to...

2467
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:01,200
Oh my god, we got the Shittim!

2468
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:05,960
We got something, Blue Archive!

2469
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:08,160
The blue sky of Shittim!

2470
01:46:13,130 --> 01:46:15,650
That's... Okay, actually I'm quite happy about that.

2471
01:46:17,130 --> 01:46:18,790
She's undead serious.

2472
01:46:19,150 --> 01:46:20,950
She's undead unserious.

2473
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:22,890
That's quite the...

2474
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:25,790
That is actually what it's called in Blue Archive.

2475
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:26,610
The Shittim chest.

2476
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:31,050
Exquisite... Oh, sorry.

2477
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:32,750
Exquisite.

2478
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:33,850
What is this?

2479
01:46:34,690 --> 01:46:35,590
Rainbow trail.

2480
01:46:36,150 --> 01:46:37,170
Decoration to equip.

2481
01:46:37,570 --> 01:46:39,030
And this one!

2482
01:46:45,570 --> 01:46:47,070
Binah the Great Snake.

2483
01:46:47,610 --> 01:46:50,510
Oh, and this one's also... limited.

2484
01:46:51,010 --> 01:46:51,830
Oh, and this one too!

2485
01:46:51,830 --> 01:46:53,670
So we did get a few...

2486
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:55,370
We got three of the limited things at least.

2487
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:57,070
Star of Peroro.

2488
01:46:58,230 --> 01:46:59,370
Wait, how do I...

2489
01:46:59,370 --> 01:47:03,390
How do I equip the thingy?

2490
01:47:03,430 --> 01:47:08,130
The Ritchie effects and music are far more fun thing to get in game.

2491
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:10,230
Dorm?

2492
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:15,100
Decoration.

2493
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:19,060
Dome.

2494
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:20,960
Ritchie.

2495
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:24,600
Oh yeah, we have no music, you're right.

2496
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:26,040
Tablecloth.

2497
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:27,920
Oh, it's so pretty!

2498
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,860
We didn't get anything else, yeah.

2499
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:31,820
Okay, save.

2500
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:32,800
Nice.

2501
01:47:42,070 --> 01:47:44,230
Items can be gifted to characters to bond them.

2502
01:47:44,410 --> 01:47:48,490
Oh, you need to get five bond hearts to unlock the character's voice lines for Yaku.

2503
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:49,210
Ah!

2504
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:51,310
Got it, got it.

2505
01:47:52,730 --> 01:47:53,590
Arona doko.

2506
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:55,710
I wish, I wish, I wish.

2507
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:57,230
Okay, hide screen.

2508
01:47:57,230 --> 01:47:57,290
Hide screen.

2509
01:48:03,050 --> 01:48:07,050
Maybe it's worth getting the twenty-four hundred since you get the bonus twenty-four hundred.

2510
01:48:09,790 --> 01:48:10,410
Wait, what?

2511
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:12,090
There's a forty-nine hundred one?

2512
01:48:13,190 --> 01:48:14,330
Wait, go away, go away.

2513
01:48:16,290 --> 01:48:18,110
Oh, there's an eight one.

2514
01:48:18,830 --> 01:48:20,810
There's an eighty dollar one.

2515
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:21,890
I didn't even see that.

2516
01:48:25,070 --> 01:48:25,550
What?

2517
01:48:25,550 --> 01:48:25,630
What?

2518
01:48:26,570 --> 01:48:27,570
Oh my gosh.

2519
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:36,890
Defended my PhD dissertation yesterday.

2520
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:40,010
I wanted to say thanks for so many fun streams I watched while prepping.

2521
01:48:40,110 --> 01:48:40,730
Good luck with the gacha.

2522
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:41,470
Oh my gosh.

2523
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:42,190
Congrats!

2524
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:44,490
How do I say your name?

2525
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:45,510
Zez... Zezby?

2526
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:46,090
Zezby?

2527
01:48:46,970 --> 01:48:47,410
Congratulations!

2528
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:50,150
Oh my gosh, doctor.

2529
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:53,210
So smart.

2530
01:48:55,990 --> 01:48:59,490
Sharing some mahjong sans after luck-maxing Aru.

2531
01:48:59,570 --> 01:49:00,270
First pull!

2532
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:03,910
Make sure you check your junk for blue items for a free pull.

2533
01:49:04,110 --> 01:49:06,250
I already did check, but thank you!

2534
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:08,570
Okay.

2535
01:49:11,490 --> 01:49:16,430
I'm not so invested to go in all so quickly yet.

2536
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:20,590
What card did I use?

2537
01:49:21,130 --> 01:49:21,450
Thank you!

2538
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:25,430
Okay, this one.

2539
01:49:27,970 --> 01:49:28,690
Credit card.

2540
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:30,970
Do I have to put it in again?

2541
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:31,350
I do.

2542
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:43,460
I'm actually...

2543
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:47,300
You know, I could use this on actual Blue Archive.

2544
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,380
Am I stupid?

2545
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:56,340
I've... To be honest, I'm spending more on this than I've spent in actual Blue Archive.

2546
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:58,400
Is that kind of crazy?

2547
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,800
I'm actually...

2548
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:12,520
Kind of crazy.

2549
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:17,250
Summon!

2550
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:20,950
So this gives me how many...

2551
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:23,070
How many summons?

2552
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:23,930
Wait...

2553
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:27,730
Someone help please...

2554
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:28,310
Fake me!

2555
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:30,710
Totally not for gotcha!

2556
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:31,830
Thank you for the akatsupa.

2557
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:33,110
Super, thank you.

2558
01:50:36,230 --> 01:50:38,170
Two... with some left over.

2559
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:46,490
Purple.

2560
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:48,350
Purple.

2561
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:56,740
I got a bone?

2562
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:58,900
I got a bone to pick with you.

2563
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:01,200
Railgun event is soon too.

2564
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:03,300
It's okay, I have some gemis saved up.

2565
01:51:07,350 --> 01:51:08,270
Laser blast.

2566
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:10,250
Got

2567
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:13,940
the petal!

2568
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:17,800
I just forgot that, I guess.

2569
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:23,420
Oh, you're right.

2570
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:24,020
I don't...

2571
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:29,220
It's like... almost enough to do a second one.

2572
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:31,240
Or a third one, I mean.

2573
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:45,360
Are there...

2574
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,300
Can the...

2575
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:51,500
Can the game...

2576
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:54,480
Like a... wow, gorgeous dress.

2577
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:56,220
You have terrible luck.

2578
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:57,320
Um...

2579
01:51:58,740 --> 01:51:59,940
Yeah, actually, I do.

2580
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:02,340
This is like... It's part of my...

2581
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:02,800
Um...

2582
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:04,660
It's part of my charm.

2583
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:07,080
It's just... It's one of my...

2584
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:08,780
It's one of my charm points.

2585
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:09,880
How...

2586
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:11,900
How bad my luck is.

2587
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:16,320
This is some of the worst I've seen.

2588
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:16,940
Sorry, man.

2589
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:17,760
That's okay.

2590
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:23,000
It's part of my charm point.

2591
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:24,520
That I have such bad luck.

2592
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:27,660
Going to my first Hololive concert tomorrow.

2593
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:28,360
I'm super excited.

2594
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:32,280
Going to be a million times more excited.

2595
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,300
If such when you decide to do a concert.

2596
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:36,840
And I can go to that too.

2597
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:38,240
Oh my gosh, have fun though, Pat!

2598
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:41,000
Wait, what's the concert?

2599
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:44,540
Okay.

2600
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:47,520
Um, how much do I need to...

2601
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:48,960
To...

2602
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:50,300
Get...

2603
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:50,900
What is it?

2604
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:51,180
800?

2605
01:52:51,180 --> 01:52:51,340
800?

2606
01:52:57,410 --> 01:52:59,050
Oh, DreamHack in Melbourne!

2607
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:02,130
Mel...

2608
01:53:02,690 --> 01:53:03,010
Melbourne.

2609
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:04,450
Melbourne.

2610
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:06,150
The five dollar one.

2611
01:53:07,950 --> 01:53:09,130
Six... Okay, you're right.

2612
01:53:09,630 --> 01:53:09,950
Okay.

2613
01:53:10,630 --> 01:53:11,270
Goodbye.

2614
01:53:11,830 --> 01:53:12,750
Five dollars.

2615
01:53:13,630 --> 01:53:15,170
To you, my young soul.

2616
01:53:15,990 --> 01:53:16,630
Mel...

2617
01:53:16,630 --> 01:53:17,090
Melbourne.

2618
01:53:17,870 --> 01:53:19,670
Oh, you're going to Melbourne, mate.

2619
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:21,790
I

2620
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:28,470
have like this, um...

2621
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:31,070
What's the word?

2622
01:53:32,370 --> 01:53:32,850
What?

2623
01:53:33,110 --> 01:53:33,590
No!

2624
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:36,150
Wrong for Robin, no!

2625
01:53:38,970 --> 01:53:40,550
Imagine spending money on gacha.

2626
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:41,690
Who would do such a thing?

2627
01:53:41,950 --> 01:53:44,970
Also, what have you done while you were still alive to get cursed with such luck?

2628
01:53:45,670 --> 01:53:46,050
Um...

2629
01:53:46,050 --> 01:53:47,570
Well, actually...

2630
01:53:47,570 --> 01:53:49,250
Um, I'm kind of cursed.

2631
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:50,570
Um...

2632
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:51,350
My...

2633
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:55,270
Like, my ghost family were all kind of cursed, you know?

2634
01:53:55,950 --> 01:53:56,430
Um...

2635
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:57,150
Wait.

2636
01:53:57,310 --> 01:53:59,330
Making sure you can't see it all of a sudden.

2637
01:54:00,670 --> 01:54:01,230
Um...

2638
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:05,170
Basically, I have a curse upon my family.

2639
01:54:08,450 --> 01:54:09,010
Um...

2640
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:14,350
Not the sand.

2641
01:54:14,530 --> 01:54:15,850
How did you know?

2642
01:54:16,330 --> 01:54:19,330
How did you know it was a sand curse?

2643
01:54:19,590 --> 01:54:21,470
How did you know that?

2644
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:26,050
How did you know?

2645
01:54:29,250 --> 01:54:30,670
How did you know that?

2646
01:54:31,750 --> 01:54:32,230
We're psychic.

2647
01:54:32,690 --> 01:54:34,190
Sand curses are so common.

2648
01:54:34,330 --> 01:54:35,510
Ah, I see, I see, I see.

2649
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:37,050
I see, I see, I see.

2650
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:39,110
Classic curse trope.

2651
01:54:39,210 --> 01:54:39,690
Ah!

2652
01:54:39,990 --> 01:54:41,070
I see, I see.

2653
01:54:43,290 --> 01:54:44,250
Yeah, um...

2654
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:46,630
I took a family vacation once.

2655
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:49,210
And, um...

2656
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:54,270
On that family vacation, my mom, she was told not to touch the sand.

2657
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:56,010
And you know what she did?

2658
01:54:56,090 --> 01:54:56,850
She brought it home.

2659
01:54:57,170 --> 01:55:00,530
And ever since then, my family has been cursed.

2660
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:01,730
My...

2661
01:55:01,730 --> 01:55:03,190
My ectoplasm line.

2662
01:55:05,870 --> 01:55:07,530
I wonder if it counts as bloodline.

2663
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:08,470
I mean...

2664
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:13,480
I don't know.

2665
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:13,980
Oh my gosh.

2666
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:14,260
Link!

2667
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:15,000
Thank you for the hack.

2668
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:17,240
Apologies for being an enabler.

2669
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:18,400
Oh my gosh.

2670
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:21,100
You guys.

2671
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:23,440
Gacha is too scary on stream.

2672
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,220
This is why I never do gacha on stream.

2673
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,360
But I was like, it's Blue Archive.

2674
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:29,860
Okay.

2675
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,060
Also, I don't...

2676
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:33,340
Is there...

2677
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:33,980
What does this mean?

2678
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:34,520
Is there a pity?

2679
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:35,000
I don't know.

2680
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,140
Oh wow!

2681
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,600
That's a really high pity.

2682
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:39,640
Holy cow.

2683
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:46,940
Return the sand or suffer my curse.

2684
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:48,420
Oh!

2685
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:49,560
Stop!

2686
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:52,600
Chiron-chan, please.

2687
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,000
A wild shiro appears.

2688
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:55,960
Shiro-ko.

2689
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:57,740
Shiro-ko, come home!

2690
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:03,420
I'm not gonna look.

2691
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:04,080
I'm not gonna look.

2692
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:06,440
Did I get it?

2693
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:07,120
Did I get it?

2694
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:08,140
I got it!

2695
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:10,280
Okay.

2696
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:25,280
You know what?

2697
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:27,760
You know what?

2698
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:29,380
I'll take it.

2699
01:56:30,460 --> 01:56:31,600
I'll take it.

2700
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:34,160
Oh!

2701
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:34,960
We got more music.

2702
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:35,860
Path to...

2703
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:36,300
Or not.

2704
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:36,740
We got...

2705
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:37,480
Any music.

2706
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:39,000
Normal dress.

2707
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:41,400
A delicate fanzine.

2708
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:43,220
Diamonds.

2709
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:46,840
Idiot!

2710
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:46,960
Yippee!

2711
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:51,120
The desire sensor...

2712
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:54,600
The desire sensor called it, you know?

2713
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:56,140
I'm glad you got someone.

2714
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:57,400
I know.

2715
01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:04,450
The desire sensor was just like, um, mutsuki last.

2716
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:08,850
We'll have you change that... that, um, that perception.

2717
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:12,470
You can always keep pulling.

2718
01:57:12,850 --> 01:57:14,010
I do kinda wanna...

2719
01:57:14,330 --> 01:57:16,430
I wanna get at least shiro-ko.

2720
01:57:18,250 --> 01:57:18,970
Hold on.

2721
01:57:18,970 --> 01:57:19,130
I don't know.

2722
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:19,530
Wait.

2723
01:57:19,590 --> 01:57:20,230
Do I go to my dorm?

2724
01:57:29,350 --> 01:57:31,090
My body's gonna be in that bag.

2725
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:37,150
Let's see.

2726
01:57:37,850 --> 01:57:38,290
Um...

2727
01:57:38,290 --> 01:57:39,770
Did I get anything here?

2728
01:57:40,050 --> 01:57:41,190
I got the music though, right?

2729
01:57:42,430 --> 01:57:43,450
We'll try that one.

2730
01:57:43,950 --> 01:57:46,010
In the back, we got the perorouzama.

2731
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:47,550
That's the one.

2732
01:57:48,050 --> 01:57:48,530
That's the one.

2733
01:57:48,530 --> 01:57:49,810
Double-click to use her?

2734
01:57:50,590 --> 01:57:53,830
Wait, didn't I... did I not... Oh, thank you.

2735
01:57:58,870 --> 01:58:00,730
I don't think we had anything else.

2736
01:58:03,550 --> 01:58:05,650
I want to get different hands too.

2737
01:58:07,310 --> 01:58:08,550
You can listen to the music here?

2738
01:58:08,610 --> 01:58:08,890
You can?

2739
01:58:12,930 --> 01:58:13,670
Oh, there it is.

2740
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:24,400
I do...

2741
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:27,980
Maybe play around to reset your luck.

2742
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:29,240
Good plan.

2743
01:58:36,810 --> 01:58:38,750
Get that violin.

2744
01:58:41,070 --> 01:58:43,910
I can never tell the difference between a viola and a violin.

2745
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:49,330
Oh wait, save?

2746
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:52,450
Why is it so quiet?

2747
01:58:57,220 --> 01:58:58,640
Viola is just deeper sounding?

2748
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:02,820
It's so quiet.

2749
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:36,520
You know what?

2750
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:36,720
Okay.

2751
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:40,960
Let's do... Would a friendly match be the one with the AI or...

2752
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:43,060
Wait, how do I play with the computers?

2753
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:51,950
Create room?

2754
01:59:57,430 --> 01:59:57,830
Limited.

2755
02:00:02,110 --> 02:00:02,910
Thinking time.

2756
02:00:03,170 --> 02:00:04,550
I need a lot of thinking time.

2757
02:00:05,810 --> 02:00:06,910
Friendly create AI.

2758
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:08,150
Oh, versus AI.

2759
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:08,630
There we go.

2760
02:00:08,710 --> 02:00:09,270
Thank you guys.

2761
02:00:11,430 --> 02:00:12,530
It's so quiet.

2762
02:00:14,650 --> 02:00:15,710
It's so quiet.

2763
02:00:16,010 --> 02:00:16,190
Okay.

2764
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:17,370
So this is my first game.

2765
02:00:17,450 --> 02:00:18,270
We're going to play with the AI.

2766
02:00:24,740 --> 02:00:25,240
What?

2767
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:26,320
Where's the music?

2768
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:28,500
Oh, thank goodness.

2769
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:33,040
Oh, okay.

2770
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:33,780
Let's see.

2771
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:36,140
We could get four, five, six.

2772
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:38,700
Oh gosh.

2773
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:44,160
Hold on.

2774
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:45,440
We have five, six, seven.

2775
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:48,900
Yeah.

2776
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:49,680
Three, four.

2777
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:51,580
We have a pair.

2778
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:53,240
Okay.

2779
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:53,900
I'm tossing this.

2780
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:05,530
This is so stressful now.

2781
02:01:07,210 --> 02:01:08,970
We don't want these two, though.

2782
02:01:09,030 --> 02:01:11,870
And it seems like we're going for the... for the...

2783
02:01:12,890 --> 02:01:14,110
Simples one, right?

2784
02:01:14,230 --> 02:01:14,710
Maybe.

2785
02:01:14,810 --> 02:01:16,270
Maybe a simple would be easiest.

2786
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:17,430
So, get rid of you.

2787
02:01:20,150 --> 02:01:20,450
Dang.

2788
02:01:22,190 --> 02:01:23,270
We're just getting rid of those.

2789
02:01:38,050 --> 02:01:38,870
Maybe this one.

2790
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:46,740
Oh, okay.

2791
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:48,600
Now we have...

2792
02:01:51,060 --> 02:01:53,000
Maybe I get rid of one of the five... wait.

2793
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:54,220
We have a pair of four.

2794
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:55,300
So I get rid of the five.

2795
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:56,260
So we have five, six, seven.

2796
02:01:56,260 --> 02:01:57,160
Maybe.

2797
02:01:58,780 --> 02:01:59,240
Four.

2798
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:00,080
Get rid of the four.

2799
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:02,300
Get rid of four mon... oh, four mon.

2800
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:04,520
Wait, why?

2801
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:06,260
Hold the pins.

2802
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:07,860
Okay, I'll hold the pins.

2803
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:09,260
Four mon.

2804
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:10,280
Okay.

2805
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:17,260
I have to pay attention to what they're... Oh, we have a triplet!

2806
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:21,080
We have a... a triplet.

2807
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:23,680
Um...

2808
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:27,820
Maybe I get rid of the three, then?

2809
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:30,660
Because... I have the triplet.

2810
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:34,020
We're not going for the... the... sequence anymore?

2811
02:02:34,820 --> 02:02:35,480
Three bamboo?

2812
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:35,760
Okay.

2813
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:38,060
We're on the same... we're on the same page, everybody!

2814
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:39,160
Good, good, good!

2815
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:41,660
Uh, oh.

2816
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:43,060
Goodbye.

2817
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:44,720
Goodbye, East.

2818
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:48,120
Maybe.

2819
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:51,580
Ah!

2820
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:53,840
Uh...

2821
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:55,640
Hmm...

2822
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:58,520
I don't think we need this one either, too, though, right?

2823
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:01,400
The five... yeah.

2824
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:10,060
Sayonara, dragon inside of me.

2825
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:11,600
Nope, nope.

2826
02:03:11,660 --> 02:03:12,040
Toss it?

2827
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:12,240
Okay.

2828
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:16,360
Sayonara, dragon inside of me.

2829
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:17,700
Okay.

2830
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:19,060
Oh, chi?

2831
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:20,220
Oh!

2832
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:21,940
Wait, should I call it?

2833
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:24,740
Should I do the chi or should I...

2834
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:25,680
Hmm...

2835
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:29,320
Because it's the five man.

2836
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:30,520
No?

2837
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:31,180
Skip?

2838
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:33,180
Okay.

2839
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:37,080
You shouldn't yet.

2840
02:03:37,620 --> 02:03:38,080
Okay.

2841
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:39,540
Okay.

2842
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:40,520
Don't open your hand.

2843
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:40,800
Okay.

2844
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:41,460
Okay.

2845
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:42,180
Thanks, guys.

2846
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,840
Thanks, guys.

2847
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:45,080
Thanks.

2848
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:46,540
Um...

2849
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:50,740
If I have a... pair.

2850
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:51,420
I have a pair.

2851
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:52,140
Pair, pair.

2852
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:52,780
So goodbye, Six.

2853
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:58,540
Wait.

2854
02:03:58,540 --> 02:03:58,960
Wait.

2855
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:01,280
Um...

2856
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:03,920
Oh.

2857
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:06,800
The Dora... yeah, rip Dora.

2858
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:07,660
It's okay, though.

2859
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:08,980
Did she do it?

2860
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:11,280
I'm scared.

2861
02:04:11,940 --> 02:04:13,420
What do I... wait, what do I do?

2862
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:15,080
Wait.

2863
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:16,640
What do I do here?

2864
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:17,400
Oh, I have ten seconds!

2865
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:18,320
Wait, what do I do?

2866
02:04:21,660 --> 02:04:22,060
Seven?

2867
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:27,240
What's going on?

2868
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:29,300
Wait, now I'm actually so confused.

2869
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:31,180
Oh, wait, the game is playing for me.

2870
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,340
Wait, can I sumo?

2871
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:36,220
Wait, sumo is which one again?

2872
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:39,060
That's the one where you, um...

2873
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:40,600
Sumo?

2874
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:47,480
Yippee!

2875
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:51,580
Sumo is you drew your winning tie.

2876
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:52,400
Oh, that's right.

2877
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:52,820
That's right.

2878
02:04:57,150 --> 02:04:57,530
Okay.

2879
02:04:57,650 --> 02:04:59,170
When it gets a little fast...

2880
02:04:59,170 --> 02:05:00,790
My brain is like can't keep up.

2881
02:05:00,890 --> 02:05:01,770
Oh, okay.

2882
02:05:03,010 --> 02:05:05,170
My brain... my brain is can't keep up.

2883
02:05:05,230 --> 02:05:05,670
Okay, hold on.

2884
02:05:05,770 --> 02:05:07,150
Let's see, I have...

2885
02:05:07,150 --> 02:05:08,490
Oh, I have a pair here.

2886
02:05:09,290 --> 02:05:09,810
Um...

2887
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:11,110
To pair here...

2888
02:05:11,110 --> 02:05:13,010
Uh... I'm gonna get...

2889
02:05:17,090 --> 02:05:23,490
I need all my notes in... in... in format of pictures.

2890
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:24,410
Oh my gosh.

2891
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:27,550
Um...

2892
02:05:27,550 --> 02:05:28,110
Uh...

2893
02:05:30,050 --> 02:05:31,290
Tough hand, not gonna lie.

2894
02:05:32,790 --> 02:05:35,150
If you hit the R on the side, it will auto-call your win.

2895
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:35,530
Really?

2896
02:05:35,870 --> 02:05:37,030
No, I wanna learn though.

2897
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:38,230
Six bamboo.

2898
02:05:41,390 --> 02:05:42,210
Get rid of the...

2899
02:05:42,210 --> 02:05:45,350
Either toss the 8P or the 6S.

2900
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:47,830
Drop the soul?

2901
02:05:48,030 --> 02:05:48,350
Okay.

2902
02:05:59,180 --> 02:05:59,620
Skip?

2903
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:01,320
Wait.

2904
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:02,920
Skip.

2905
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:06,460
Skip for now.

2906
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:08,520
Six bamboo people are crazy.

2907
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:09,840
Hey.

2908
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:11,700
Everyone's gonna have their own...

2909
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:13,020
Uh...

2910
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:15,080
Um...

2911
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:15,440
Okay.

2912
02:06:15,540 --> 02:06:17,160
Four, six, eight, nine...

2913
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:18,420
Um...

2914
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:19,840
Sa...

2915
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:20,800
Maybe...

2916
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:21,400
Uh...

2917
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:22,600
Wait.

2918
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:25,060
Um...

2919
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:35,930
The two...

2920
02:06:36,610 --> 02:06:37,450
I'm looking...

2921
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:38,350
Wait, it's half flush again.

2922
02:06:38,510 --> 02:06:38,890
Oh my gosh.

2923
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:40,430
I need more time to think.

2924
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:43,110
Can only contain...

2925
02:06:43,110 --> 02:06:44,470
One suit, triplet.

2926
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:45,450
Wait.

2927
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:46,970
100 tiles.

2928
02:06:47,190 --> 02:06:47,850
Oh, oh.

2929
02:06:48,170 --> 02:06:48,690
Wait.

2930
02:06:51,050 --> 02:06:51,570
No.

2931
02:06:57,390 --> 02:06:59,230
I don't know what to throw out.

2932
02:07:09,250 --> 02:07:09,770
Goodbye.

2933
02:07:10,310 --> 02:07:10,830
Shoot.

2934
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:11,690
That was bad.

2935
02:07:13,070 --> 02:07:14,470
I should've just picked something.

2936
02:07:14,690 --> 02:07:15,790
Oh, we got the six though.

2937
02:07:18,130 --> 02:07:20,170
Oh my gosh.

2938
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:20,410
Wait.

2939
02:07:20,850 --> 02:07:21,910
Oh my gosh.

2940
02:07:21,950 --> 02:07:22,070
Oh my gosh.

2941
02:07:22,070 --> 02:07:22,670
I'm just...

2942
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:24,010
I'm like half reading my notes.

2943
02:07:25,450 --> 02:07:26,050
Um...

2944
02:07:26,050 --> 02:07:26,990
Three

2945
02:07:31,820 --> 02:07:32,480
dragon tiles.

2946
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:34,360
A prevalent wind.

2947
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:35,660
I'm south.

2948
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:38,000
So...

2949
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:39,880
And we're on...

2950
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:43,080
Well, I could get the east wind, maybe, if I get any more.

2951
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:45,280
Yeah.

2952
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:47,800
Nine man or east?

2953
02:07:48,020 --> 02:07:48,320
Really?

2954
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:50,920
The nine man?

2955
02:07:53,720 --> 02:07:54,560
Nine man?

2956
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:54,780
Okay.

2957
02:07:55,580 --> 02:07:56,180
Yeah.

2958
02:07:56,380 --> 02:07:56,880
Nine man or east?

2959
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:57,600
Oh!

2960
02:07:58,060 --> 02:07:59,100
She took it.

2961
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:03,020
I don't need the two.

2962
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:08,860
Oh!

2963
02:08:09,900 --> 02:08:10,580
Wait.

2964
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:12,900
Um...

2965
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:16,560
Would keeping the west be any good?

2966
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:17,820
What would it...

2967
02:08:23,090 --> 02:08:24,690
Drop the west?

2968
02:08:26,590 --> 02:08:28,190
Oh, yeah, because I'm...

2969
02:08:28,190 --> 02:08:29,070
Yeah, I'm south seat.

2970
02:08:30,670 --> 02:08:31,350
Goodbye.

2971
02:08:31,450 --> 02:08:31,530
Okay.

2972
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:33,530
Oh!

2973
02:08:37,070 --> 02:08:37,790
Two?

2974
02:08:38,170 --> 02:08:38,510
Okay.

2975
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:40,330
This is hard.

2976
02:08:44,070 --> 02:08:44,790
Maybe...

2977
02:08:47,870 --> 02:08:49,590
East is dead?

2978
02:08:50,590 --> 02:08:51,810
Oh, because it's...

2979
02:08:51,810 --> 02:08:52,050
Oh!

2980
02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:52,630
Oh!

2981
02:08:52,810 --> 02:08:54,250
Because they're here!

2982
02:08:54,590 --> 02:08:55,190
Okay.

2983
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:56,190
Goodbye, east.

2984
02:08:57,130 --> 02:08:57,850
No!

2985
02:09:01,660 --> 02:09:02,380
Drop...

2986
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:02,940
You.

2987
02:09:08,570 --> 02:09:09,290
There.

2988
02:09:09,290 --> 02:09:09,570
Okay.

2989
02:09:09,570 --> 02:09:09,950
There.

2990
02:09:10,290 --> 02:09:10,670
Wait.

2991
02:09:10,830 --> 02:09:11,670
Pon for what?

2992
02:09:12,430 --> 02:09:13,110
The two?

2993
02:09:14,270 --> 02:09:14,710
Um...

2994
02:09:16,490 --> 02:09:17,910
I could get the triplet.

2995
02:09:19,450 --> 02:09:21,450
But I can still also get triplet of four.

2996
02:09:23,730 --> 02:09:24,170
Um...

2997
02:09:25,090 --> 02:09:25,850
I'm gonna skip.

2998
02:09:29,450 --> 02:09:29,890
Oh!

2999
02:09:29,950 --> 02:09:30,230
Oh!

3000
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:30,730
I got a seven.

3001
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:31,090
Oh!

3002
02:09:31,230 --> 02:09:31,970
I got a seven!

3003
02:09:32,430 --> 02:09:32,850
Ah!

3004
02:09:32,930 --> 02:09:33,290
Wait.

3005
02:09:33,390 --> 02:09:34,690
So I can get rid of this four.

3006
02:09:34,930 --> 02:09:35,210
Right?

3007
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:37,170
So...

3008
02:09:40,370 --> 02:09:41,210
Four man and east.

3009
02:09:41,230 --> 02:09:41,250
One out.

3010
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:47,820
Toss the white.

3011
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:48,280
Okay.

3012
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:49,000
Oh!

3013
02:09:49,020 --> 02:09:49,540
We got eight.

3014
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:50,080
Okay.

3015
02:09:50,180 --> 02:09:50,820
I guess...

3016
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:52,560
We'll get rid of the white.

3017
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:54,560
Goodbye.

3018
02:09:56,280 --> 02:09:56,660
Bye bye.

3019
02:09:58,160 --> 02:09:58,800
Ah...

3020
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:00,160
Goodbye.

3021
02:10:18,430 --> 02:10:19,070
Skip.

3022
02:10:19,930 --> 02:10:21,110
Never be pon.

3023
02:10:23,310 --> 02:10:23,950
Ah...

3024
02:10:24,750 --> 02:10:25,390
Oh!

3025
02:10:25,790 --> 02:10:26,130
Ah!

3026
02:10:26,570 --> 02:10:27,210
Um...

3027
02:10:28,190 --> 02:10:28,830
Skip.

3028
02:10:30,390 --> 02:10:31,030
Skip.

3029
02:10:31,050 --> 02:10:31,350
Skip.

3030
02:10:31,610 --> 02:10:31,990
Skip.

3031
02:10:32,970 --> 02:10:33,350
Skip.

3032
02:10:34,590 --> 02:10:34,970
Skip.

3033
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:35,510
Never change.

3034
02:10:37,730 --> 02:10:38,110
Oh!

3035
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:38,710
Wait!

3036
02:10:39,190 --> 02:10:40,870
We ended up getting the nine anyway.

3037
02:10:41,230 --> 02:10:41,990
That's so funny.

3038
02:10:44,770 --> 02:10:45,150
But...

3039
02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:51,390
Um...

3040
02:10:53,030 --> 02:10:54,330
Can you move over to the...?

3041
02:10:54,330 --> 02:10:54,690
Oh yeah!

3042
02:10:54,730 --> 02:10:55,370
Yeah, give me a second.

3043
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:56,390
Can I pause?

3044
02:10:57,310 --> 02:10:59,530
Yeah, I'll move over a little bit so you guys can see.

3045
02:11:01,030 --> 02:11:01,670
There you go.

3046
02:11:02,290 --> 02:11:02,670
Oh!

3047
02:11:02,710 --> 02:11:03,150
Not that.

3048
02:11:07,330 --> 02:11:07,950
There you go.

3049
02:11:08,610 --> 02:11:09,370
It's not paused?

3050
02:11:19,070 --> 02:11:19,950
You can't pause?

3051
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:22,870
8p?

3052
02:11:24,550 --> 02:11:25,170
Thank you guys.

3053
02:11:25,330 --> 02:11:26,310
I don't know what I would do without you.

3054
02:11:26,730 --> 02:11:27,970
I am trying to think for myself.

3055
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:28,750
Goodbye.

3056
02:11:31,630 --> 02:11:33,230
I'm not trying to rely on you guys too much.

3057
02:11:33,310 --> 02:11:33,890
But also, goodbye!

3058
02:11:36,110 --> 02:11:36,430
Dang!

3059
02:11:36,610 --> 02:11:38,030
That would have maybe been kind of good though.

3060
02:11:39,510 --> 02:11:39,870
5!

3061
02:11:40,710 --> 02:11:41,990
Wait, why is it red?

3062
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:43,450
Why is it different?

3063
02:11:46,490 --> 02:11:47,250
You got this!

3064
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:47,930
Chie!

3065
02:11:49,090 --> 02:11:50,170
Chie, I'm scared!

3066
02:11:53,850 --> 02:11:54,350
Dora?

3067
02:11:54,810 --> 02:11:56,790
Wait, what does Dora mean?

3068
02:11:56,870 --> 02:11:57,670
Hold on, I need my notes.

3069
02:11:59,070 --> 02:11:59,570
Oh!

3070
02:12:03,410 --> 02:12:04,290
It is shining.

3071
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:05,270
It is shining.

3072
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:08,270
So keep.

3073
02:12:09,950 --> 02:12:11,690
Maybe get rid of the 6?

3074
02:12:13,390 --> 02:12:13,790
Or...

3075
02:12:15,390 --> 02:12:16,110
9 man?

3076
02:12:17,490 --> 02:12:18,370
6 or 9 man.

3077
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:20,630
We'll get rid of the 9 man.

3078
02:12:22,930 --> 02:12:23,670
I can't.

3079
02:12:23,790 --> 02:12:24,190
6.

3080
02:12:24,390 --> 02:12:25,230
I said 6 earlier.

3081
02:12:25,370 --> 02:12:25,830
I'm going to commit.

3082
02:12:25,970 --> 02:12:26,430
I'm going to commit.

3083
02:12:26,530 --> 02:12:27,350
I'm going to commit to the bit.

3084
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:29,550
Goodbye.

3085
02:12:35,890 --> 02:12:36,930
We don't need...

3086
02:12:36,930 --> 02:12:37,070
Goodbye.

3087
02:12:40,710 --> 02:12:41,990
What am I pointing for?

3088
02:12:43,670 --> 02:12:44,070
Oh!

3089
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:45,170
Wait!

3090
02:12:45,170 --> 02:12:45,330
Wait!

3091
02:12:45,710 --> 02:12:46,230
Wait!

3092
02:12:46,270 --> 02:12:47,470
Should I for the 8?

3093
02:12:47,690 --> 02:12:49,170
So we can get the triple?

3094
02:12:50,310 --> 02:12:50,830
Wait!

3095
02:12:51,230 --> 02:12:51,750
Skip?

3096
02:12:51,890 --> 02:12:52,150
Really?

3097
02:12:54,210 --> 02:12:55,410
Never be born?

3098
02:12:56,190 --> 02:12:57,110
7 pairs?

3099
02:12:57,990 --> 02:12:58,790
Wait, I...

3100
02:13:00,630 --> 02:13:01,150
Skip?

3101
02:13:01,610 --> 02:13:02,510
Okay, I'll skip.

3102
02:13:04,330 --> 02:13:05,530
I trust you guys.

3103
02:13:05,970 --> 02:13:07,330
We're going for 7 pairs.

3104
02:13:07,790 --> 02:13:08,250
Skip?

3105
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:09,330
Okay, I trust you Chie.

3106
02:13:09,450 --> 02:13:09,810
Skip?

3107
02:13:09,850 --> 02:13:10,350
I trust you.

3108
02:13:12,030 --> 02:13:13,470
Anything Chie says...

3109
02:13:13,470 --> 02:13:14,610
Chie is God.

3110
02:13:14,610 --> 02:13:14,690
Chie is God.

3111
02:13:29,910 --> 02:13:30,770
Chie is God.

3112
02:13:32,710 --> 02:13:40,770
General rule of thumb for your first discards is non-yakkuhai wins first, then isolated ones and 9s, then yakkuhai.

3113
02:13:41,050 --> 02:13:44,070
If you have a pair of any of the above, you should usually keep it.

3114
02:13:44,410 --> 02:13:46,490
We have two easts!

3115
02:13:47,490 --> 02:13:49,270
We have two easts!

3116
02:13:51,030 --> 02:13:51,570
Let's go.

3117
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:54,530
We have two 8s.

3118
02:13:55,210 --> 02:13:55,890
Let's see.

3119
02:13:59,830 --> 02:14:01,770
Now you pwn East.

3120
02:14:02,090 --> 02:14:02,530
Okay...

3121
02:14:06,130 --> 02:14:06,810
Pwn time.

3122
02:14:07,110 --> 02:14:08,810
What should I... toss though?

3123
02:14:10,370 --> 02:14:12,290
I can toss the West though.

3124
02:14:12,310 --> 02:14:13,010
Can I toss the West?

3125
02:14:16,930 --> 02:14:17,770
Drop W.

3126
02:14:17,970 --> 02:14:18,110
Okay.

3127
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:29,380
I don't really need... this either.

3128
02:14:29,380 --> 02:14:46,900
I will drop three so the nine pin six or nine pin I could drop either of them yeah we'll drop the nine pin we'll

3129
02:14:50,190 --> 02:14:56,910
keep a five pin right we have pair here

3130
02:15:03,150 --> 02:15:05,090
This is good for sequence maybe.

3131
02:15:05,310 --> 02:15:06,730
Okay, let's get rid of the one.

3132
02:15:07,130 --> 02:15:07,850
It's your mom.

3133
02:15:12,570 --> 02:15:13,090
No.

3134
02:15:14,210 --> 02:15:14,730
Skip.

3135
02:15:30,630 --> 02:15:32,710
You could have T if you kept one.

3136
02:15:33,490 --> 02:15:34,530
Yeah, but...

3137
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:38,250
Get rid of the AP?

3138
02:15:38,250 --> 02:15:38,830
Really?

3139
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:40,450
Okay.

3140
02:15:41,350 --> 02:15:43,250
Well, I could get 6, 7, 8.

3141
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:46,190
I have no idea what I'm forming.

3142
02:15:46,550 --> 02:15:47,530
I'm just playing.

3143
02:15:48,390 --> 02:15:48,990
Drop it?

3144
02:15:49,070 --> 02:15:49,550
It doesn't help?

3145
02:15:49,690 --> 02:15:49,910
Okay.

3146
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:55,800
Skip.

3147
02:15:57,360 --> 02:15:57,800
4!

3148
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:01,920
Oh, we have a sequence of 4, 5, 6.

3149
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:04,160
Okay.

3150
02:16:05,780 --> 02:16:07,400
A 7 would make 5, 6...

3151
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:08,440
We have 4, 5, 6 though.

3152
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:09,460
So I can draw the...

3153
02:16:09,460 --> 02:16:10,040
Or I can...

3154
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:10,220
Wait.

3155
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:11,260
We have 1, 2...

3156
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:14,680
We can drop either one of these then, right?

3157
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:16,460
So let's drop the...

3158
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:18,760
Let's drop the 1.

3159
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:22,500
Because we could do 2, 3, 4.

3160
02:16:28,110 --> 02:16:28,570
Oh.

3161
02:16:37,450 --> 02:16:39,570
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

3162
02:16:39,590 --> 02:16:40,410
Thank you so much.

3163
02:16:41,310 --> 02:16:41,850
Thank you.

3164
02:16:41,850 --> 02:16:42,150
Thank you.

3165
02:16:43,510 --> 02:16:43,990
Wait.

3166
02:16:44,010 --> 02:16:44,650
Drop the 8?

3167
02:16:45,330 --> 02:16:47,430
I guess because we already have other pairs.

3168
02:16:47,890 --> 02:16:48,890
And this will make a...

3169
02:16:48,890 --> 02:16:49,710
This will make a triple.

3170
02:16:49,950 --> 02:16:50,430
Okay.

3171
02:16:50,550 --> 02:16:51,570
Or a sequence, I mean.

3172
02:16:55,130 --> 02:16:55,610
North.

3173
02:16:55,930 --> 02:16:56,670
Go away.

3174
02:17:07,170 --> 02:17:07,650
Uh...

3175
02:17:08,130 --> 02:17:08,810
We don't...

3176
02:17:09,370 --> 02:17:10,230
Need it.

3177
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:15,510
Let's get rid of the 7S.

3178
02:17:15,870 --> 02:17:15,930
Hmm.

3179
02:17:19,050 --> 02:17:19,530
Yeah.

3180
02:17:20,730 --> 02:17:21,290
Toss.

3181
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:26,900
Come on!

3182
02:17:33,290 --> 02:17:33,850
Toss.

3183
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:36,490
Oh, what?

3184
02:17:36,490 --> 02:17:36,810
Keep it?

3185
02:17:37,670 --> 02:17:38,230
Ah.

3186
02:17:41,830 --> 02:17:42,390
Oops.

3187
02:17:43,870 --> 02:17:44,710
My bad.

3188
02:17:47,950 --> 02:17:48,870
Why would...

3189
02:17:48,870 --> 02:17:49,510
Why should I have...

3190
02:17:49,510 --> 02:17:50,550
Why should I...

3191
02:17:50,550 --> 02:17:52,570
Why should I have kept it?

3192
02:17:52,670 --> 02:17:53,510
Just so I know.

3193
02:17:57,010 --> 02:17:57,930
It's 1, 3, 5.

3194
02:17:58,050 --> 02:17:58,590
You can finish.

3195
02:17:59,210 --> 02:17:59,550
Wait.

3196
02:17:59,630 --> 02:18:00,810
1, 3, 5 is a thing?

3197
02:18:03,230 --> 02:18:04,610
1, 3, 5 shape is good.

3198
02:18:04,790 --> 02:18:04,910
Ah.

3199
02:18:06,190 --> 02:18:07,310
The 2 does nothing.

3200
02:18:07,650 --> 02:18:09,170
Because 2 is more useless right now.

3201
02:18:10,050 --> 02:18:10,390
Oh.

3202
02:18:10,950 --> 02:18:11,910
1, 3, 5 can be...

3203
02:18:11,910 --> 02:18:12,190
Ah.

3204
02:18:12,590 --> 02:18:13,110
I see.

3205
02:18:13,190 --> 02:18:13,390
I see.

3206
02:18:13,430 --> 02:18:13,730
I see.

3207
02:18:13,750 --> 02:18:14,130
I see.

3208
02:18:15,090 --> 02:18:15,610
I see.

3209
02:18:15,710 --> 02:18:15,930
I see.

3210
02:18:16,070 --> 02:18:16,130
I see.

3211
02:18:16,130 --> 02:18:16,470
I see.

3212
02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:19,330
You have...

3213
02:18:19,330 --> 02:18:20,250
5s.

3214
02:18:20,330 --> 02:18:20,710
Wait.

3215
02:18:20,750 --> 02:18:22,630
All 5s have a red version too for more points.

3216
02:18:22,930 --> 02:18:23,410
Oh.

3217
02:18:23,850 --> 02:18:24,550
I see.

3218
02:18:24,630 --> 02:18:24,890
I see.

3219
02:18:31,010 --> 02:18:31,490
Oh.

3220
02:18:31,530 --> 02:18:32,230
We got another 8.

3221
02:18:34,050 --> 02:18:34,530
But...

3222
02:18:34,530 --> 02:18:34,890
Um.

3223
02:18:34,890 --> 02:18:35,950
We don't need it then, right?

3224
02:18:38,790 --> 02:18:39,270
So.

3225
02:18:40,170 --> 02:18:40,850
Beginner game.

3226
02:18:41,130 --> 02:18:41,450
Hahaha.

3227
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:42,910
Yeah.

3228
02:18:42,930 --> 02:18:43,170
What?

3229
02:18:43,230 --> 02:18:44,230
Who has the East?

3230
02:18:44,790 --> 02:18:45,270
Hahaha.

3231
02:18:45,390 --> 02:18:47,030
Give me the other Easts.

3232
02:18:47,450 --> 02:18:47,930
Okay.

3233
02:18:48,010 --> 02:18:48,490
So.

3234
02:18:55,520 --> 02:18:57,460
I think I had the 8 before.

3235
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:57,820
Ah.

3236
02:18:58,540 --> 02:19:00,080
So I should pawn here.

3237
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:02,480
I should pawn for the East.

3238
02:19:03,180 --> 02:19:03,740
Right?

3239
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:05,260
Pawn.

3240
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:06,340
Pawn.

3241
02:19:07,740 --> 02:19:08,620
I pawn.

3242
02:19:10,060 --> 02:19:11,660
I pawn for...

3243
02:19:12,480 --> 02:19:13,040
Oh.

3244
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:14,240
And I discard...

3245
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:15,420
Maybe the 2...

3246
02:19:16,340 --> 02:19:16,900
Wait.

3247
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:19,640
The 2-pin.

3248
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:20,600
Yes.

3249
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:20,940
Okay.

3250
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:21,140
Okay.

3251
02:19:21,140 --> 02:19:21,180
Okay.

3252
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:21,680
I knew.

3253
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:22,120
Okay.

3254
02:19:22,280 --> 02:19:22,520
Woo.

3255
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:22,780
Woo.

3256
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:23,020
Woo.

3257
02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:25,780
Oh.

3258
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:26,860
Wait.

3259
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:28,720
Uh oh.

3260
02:19:29,460 --> 02:19:29,900
Um.

3261
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:30,680
Hahaha.

3262
02:19:32,060 --> 02:19:32,500
Ah.

3263
02:19:38,490 --> 02:19:39,150
This one.

3264
02:19:40,230 --> 02:19:41,270
I need the 2.

3265
02:19:43,050 --> 02:19:43,990
Is that what it's showing?

3266
02:19:44,130 --> 02:19:44,450
That's what...

3267
02:19:45,950 --> 02:19:46,470
Oh my god.

3268
02:19:46,530 --> 02:19:46,570
No!

3269
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:54,080
You guys.

3270
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:54,980
The AI...

3271
02:19:54,980 --> 02:19:56,200
The AI bested me.

3272
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:57,900
The AI bested...

3273
02:19:57,900 --> 02:20:01,020
We started with such a good hand too and the AI bested me.

3274
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:01,280
Hahaha.

3275
02:20:02,500 --> 02:20:03,100
Oh.

3276
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:05,180
Ah.

3277
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:07,800
It's even...

3278
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:09,080
Stop saying AI easy.

3279
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:10,220
It's making me so sad.

3280
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:11,200
Hahaha.

3281
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:13,920
The AI is sentient.

3282
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:15,320
No.

3283
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:18,260
You're good.

3284
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:19,040
You didn't feed.

3285
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:19,900
Mmm.

3286
02:20:21,220 --> 02:20:22,280
Itihime experience.

3287
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:23,120
Hahaha.

3288
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:23,960
No.

3289
02:20:24,040 --> 02:20:25,040
I did get second though.

3290
02:20:25,060 --> 02:20:25,760
I did get second.

3291
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:27,140
I didn't lose entirely.

3292
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:30,060
Let's try...

3293
02:20:30,060 --> 02:20:30,180
Let's try...

3294
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:30,340
Let's try...

3295
02:20:30,340 --> 02:20:31,020
Let's try...

3296
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:32,060
I mean...

3297
02:20:32,060 --> 02:20:32,480
Just like...

3298
02:20:32,480 --> 02:20:33,420
Just like with my gacha.

3299
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:36,180
The AIs have gotten crazier to be honest.

3300
02:20:36,400 --> 02:20:37,480
I believe you, Tia.

3301
02:20:37,900 --> 02:20:38,340
Hahaha.

3302
02:20:42,350 --> 02:20:43,710
It's just like with my gacha.

3303
02:20:43,870 --> 02:20:44,790
I didn't lose entirely.

3304
02:20:45,010 --> 02:20:46,090
I still got someone.

3305
02:20:46,290 --> 02:20:46,730
Hahaha.

3306
02:20:49,010 --> 02:20:50,050
Let me see...

3307
02:20:50,710 --> 02:20:51,650
Something real quick.

3308
02:20:52,290 --> 02:20:53,210
With my bank.

3309
02:20:55,010 --> 02:20:56,290
I had to make some...

3310
02:20:56,290 --> 02:20:58,070
I had to buy some plane tickets recently.

3311
02:20:59,370 --> 02:21:01,410
So I just want to check how my bank...

3312
02:21:01,410 --> 02:21:02,770
How my card looks right now.

3313
02:21:02,790 --> 02:21:02,870
Hahaha.

3314
02:21:04,190 --> 02:21:04,830
Hahaha.

3315
02:21:05,710 --> 02:21:06,490
Let's see.

3316
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:10,160
Mmm.

3317
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:12,560
Mmm.

3318
02:21:13,480 --> 02:21:14,120
Shits.

3319
02:21:20,670 --> 02:21:22,430
I bought with my...

3320
02:21:22,430 --> 02:21:23,550
With my miles.

3321
02:21:24,170 --> 02:21:25,110
And let's see.

3322
02:21:25,170 --> 02:21:25,930
I have...

3323
02:21:25,930 --> 02:21:27,290
Enough points.

3324
02:21:27,370 --> 02:21:28,030
Hold on.

3325
02:21:28,090 --> 02:21:30,190
I can redeem these points on my card.

3326
02:21:30,890 --> 02:21:31,530
Redeem.

3327
02:21:31,930 --> 02:21:33,010
You guys...

3328
02:21:33,010 --> 02:21:36,030
You guys getting a travel card is so awesome.

3329
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:41,700
Umm...

3330
02:21:41,700 --> 02:21:43,220
Actually, I'll do this.

3331
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:43,440
I'll do this later.

3332
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:43,860
Haha.

3333
02:21:44,380 --> 02:21:45,340
Thanks, thanks.

3334
02:21:46,300 --> 02:21:46,860
Bye.

3335
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:47,420
Bye.

3336
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:49,600
Myoshi is going to starve!

3337
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:50,880
Hahaha.

3338
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:54,400
Uhhh.

3339
02:21:55,880 --> 02:21:57,540
No money for travel.

3340
02:21:58,380 --> 02:21:59,540
Miles for Gacha.

3341
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:03,840
I don't know when we get the Patreon money.

3342
02:22:06,140 --> 02:22:07,820
I don't know actually when they...

3343
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:08,260
When that...

3344
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:08,920
When that happens.

3345
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,180
Looking good with them glasses.

3346
02:22:12,220 --> 02:22:12,780
Very cute.

3347
02:22:13,240 --> 02:22:14,120
Oh really?

3348
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:15,660
You like the glasses?

3349
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:18,160
I don't really like this style though.

3350
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:19,540
Maybe like a round glasses.

3351
02:22:24,330 --> 02:22:25,510
I'm so proud of you Mint!

3352
02:22:25,550 --> 02:22:27,270
I was so happy to see the HENYA collab!

3353
02:22:27,530 --> 02:22:28,290
You're so cute!

3354
02:22:28,390 --> 02:22:29,610
I'm so glad to see you happy!

3355
02:22:30,770 --> 02:22:31,570
Thank you!

3356
02:22:33,010 --> 02:22:34,030
Thank you, thank you.

3357
02:22:35,010 --> 02:22:36,430
Patreon is first of the month.

3358
02:22:36,690 --> 02:22:37,310
Ah okay.

3359
02:22:44,430 --> 02:22:47,130
Big round glasses with a swirly pattern on the lens.

3360
02:22:48,030 --> 02:22:50,070
Hey that's really nerd then.

3361
02:22:50,190 --> 02:22:51,990
That's really nerdy glasses then.

3362
02:22:54,830 --> 02:22:58,470
Yeah I'm so glad that I could collab with HENYA too.

3363
02:23:00,210 --> 02:23:01,190
It was so fun.

3364
02:23:01,530 --> 02:23:03,910
I actually have been thinking so much about Helldivers.

3365
02:23:04,050 --> 02:23:05,090
It was a lot of fun.

3366
02:23:06,670 --> 02:23:08,170
It was so much fun.

3367
02:23:08,790 --> 02:23:09,790
Okay just...

3368
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:12,990
Just a little bit more.

3369
02:23:14,290 --> 02:23:15,270
Just like...

3370
02:23:16,250 --> 02:23:17,250
I'll do two more.

3371
02:23:17,330 --> 02:23:17,690
Two more.

3372
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:18,130
Two more.

3373
02:23:18,350 --> 02:23:19,070
Two more.

3374
02:23:19,090 --> 02:23:19,430
Two more.

3375
02:23:20,190 --> 02:23:22,330
Two more.

3376
02:23:22,630 --> 02:23:23,610
Not two more.

3377
02:23:23,750 --> 02:23:24,490
Two more.

3378
02:23:28,540 --> 02:23:30,320
Wait how much do I have to get?

3379
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:38,960
Uh... 18... wait... 18... 18... 18...

3380
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:47,220
Awww...

3381
02:23:53,980 --> 02:23:55,720
Maybe if I do... hold on.

3382
02:23:56,940 --> 02:23:58,700
If I do like the...

3383
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:02,600
That's 24.

3384
02:24:04,300 --> 02:24:05,420
How much do I need?

3385
02:24:05,620 --> 02:24:06,080
30...

3386
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:07,900
3600.

3387
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:15,580
I could just do these two and it'll be fine.

3388
02:24:19,230 --> 02:24:20,230
Yeah 36.

3389
02:24:22,210 --> 02:24:23,870
By the way, Oshifan...

3390
02:24:23,870 --> 02:24:24,650
No!

3391
02:24:25,690 --> 02:24:26,970
Thank you though.

3392
02:24:27,050 --> 02:24:27,550
Thank you.

3393
02:24:29,890 --> 02:24:31,310
But... I'll do these two.

3394
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:33,690
I'm not going for the pity.

3395
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:40,100
But I'm really... I am... I've been wanting to learn...

3396
02:24:42,580 --> 02:24:43,280
Oh my goodness.

3397
02:24:43,460 --> 02:24:45,220
I've been wanting to learn mahjong for so long.

3398
02:24:45,900 --> 02:24:46,620
I'm serious.

3399
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:52,260
So... I want to have characters that I like to play with.

3400
02:24:53,260 --> 02:24:54,580
Characters that I like...

3401
02:24:56,120 --> 02:24:56,980
To go with.

3402
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:57,580
You know what I mean?

3403
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:01,280
Okay.

3404
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:04,440
What character do I want?

3405
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:05,140
I want Shiroko!

3406
02:25:06,460 --> 02:25:07,520
I want Shiroko.

3407
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:10,740
This one... I'm getting the other one.

3408
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:11,720
And then that's it.

3409
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:12,080
That's it.

3410
02:25:12,100 --> 02:25:12,420
That's it.

3411
02:25:12,460 --> 02:25:12,760
That's it.

3412
02:25:12,860 --> 02:25:14,200
I'm not... I'm not crazy.

3413
02:25:14,500 --> 02:25:15,340
I'm not crazy.

3414
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:21,640
Tax... Tax write-off something something.

3415
02:25:27,500 --> 02:25:30,420
On-stream content something something.

3416
02:25:31,480 --> 02:25:32,040
Um...

3417
02:25:36,320 --> 02:25:37,260
Kayoko, please.

3418
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:38,300
She's not in the game!

3419
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:47,880
It's only Aru, Mutsuki, Shiroko, and Hoshino.

3420
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:51,660
I have a poll and another gacha later.

3421
02:25:51,820 --> 02:25:53,120
Please soak my common polls.

3422
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:56,040
Oh, I sure am for you, Daniel.

3423
02:25:57,100 --> 02:25:57,660
Okay.

3424
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:00,700
Summon.

3425
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:02,300
Shiroko.

3426
02:26:02,480 --> 02:26:02,800
No.

3427
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:04,840
I don't... I don't really want Shiroko that much.

3428
02:26:04,940 --> 02:26:05,260
You know what?

3429
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:06,780
I don't really... I don't really care.

3430
02:26:08,580 --> 02:26:09,380
You know...

3431
02:26:09,380 --> 02:26:10,140
Whatever.

3432
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:12,900
I feel like I've learned so much this stream though.

3433
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:13,380
Truly.

3434
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:13,760
Truly.

3435
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:16,020
Thank you guys so much for helping me out.

3436
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:18,520
Mint, do you play Blue Archive?

3437
02:26:18,620 --> 02:26:19,380
Every day.

3438
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:22,960
I play Blue Archive every day.

3439
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:26,360
It sure would be a shame if you got Hoshino.

3440
02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:27,780
No way you'll get her.

3441
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:29,020
Surely not.

3442
02:26:29,860 --> 02:26:30,480
Give me back.

3443
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:31,520
I don't want Hoshino.

3444
02:26:31,700 --> 02:26:32,640
I don't want Aru.

3445
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:33,840
I don't want Shiroko.

3446
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:36,400
I don't want any...

3447
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:47,880
I had a dream the other night where you would turn into a fruit.

3448
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:51,760
Fortunately, it was just a figment of my imagination.

3449
02:26:57,200 --> 02:27:00,080
Oh, I got a cat paw.

3450
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:01,840
I got more shittem.

3451
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:03,800
That's actually my whole poll is a shittem.

3452
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:06,220
Thank you, game.

3453
02:27:12,610 --> 02:27:14,110
We got the cat paw though.

3454
02:27:14,450 --> 02:27:15,930
I am excited about that.

3455
02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:19,930
Alexa, play Unravel.

3456
02:27:21,090 --> 02:27:23,710
Tell me, tell me.

3457
02:27:26,290 --> 02:27:27,810
This... something, something.

3458
02:27:30,670 --> 02:27:31,830
Did I get it?

3459
02:27:32,710 --> 02:27:33,850
Did I get it?

3460
02:27:35,130 --> 02:27:36,170
Did I get it?

3461
02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:45,790
Part of the ocean?

3462
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:57,200
Hoshino!

3463
02:27:57,920 --> 02:27:58,580
Hoshino from high school.

3464
02:28:00,300 --> 02:28:02,640
I came here when I realized.

3465
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:04,120
Who said that?

3466
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:05,080
Well, let's do it easily.

3467
02:28:05,580 --> 02:28:06,380
Oh my gosh.

3468
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:10,460
It's so funny too because recently I was just like, man, I really want to cosplay Hoshino.

3469
02:28:10,820 --> 02:28:11,380
So...

3470
02:28:12,940 --> 02:28:14,680
This is so perfect.

3471
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:16,460
Who sent that earlier?

3472
02:28:16,740 --> 02:28:17,820
Who sent that earlier?

3473
02:28:17,820 --> 02:28:19,280
That's super chat.

3474
02:28:23,460 --> 02:28:25,100
Where are you?

3475
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:28,240
You...

3476
02:28:28,680 --> 02:28:29,820
It was me.

3477
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:30,540
Grump!

3478
02:28:32,120 --> 02:28:33,400
Grump, you did it.

3479
02:28:33,400 --> 02:28:34,740
You saved my poll.

3480
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:38,100
You saved it.

3481
02:28:39,380 --> 02:28:40,460
Oh my gosh.

3482
02:28:41,620 --> 02:28:42,880
Thank you for the thank you.

3483
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:43,440
Thank you.

3484
02:28:45,380 --> 02:28:46,540
Oh my gosh.

3485
02:28:46,540 --> 02:28:48,060
Grump, you were my lucky charm.

3486
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:52,140
You really did it.

3487
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:53,060
You manifested it.

3488
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:01,600
She's so cute.

3489
02:29:05,900 --> 02:29:06,980
Now single polls?

3490
02:29:07,340 --> 02:29:08,960
Oh, I do have enough for single polls, don't I?

3491
02:29:09,160 --> 02:29:10,580
I always forget that's an option.

3492
02:29:12,820 --> 02:29:14,880
It's always go big or go home, you know?

3493
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,060
We do have a couple though.

3494
02:29:17,260 --> 02:29:18,500
Go to shirt icon.

3495
02:29:18,980 --> 02:29:21,640
Oh, that's where we can buy the other things, right?

3496
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:22,800
The other skins.

3497
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:25,700
Oh, there's more?

3498
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:27,340
The bond.

3499
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:31,040
Gift.

3500
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:34,060
What's a good one?

3501
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:36,520
So if I do like this one...

3502
02:29:44,700 --> 02:29:46,020
She's sleeping on a whale.

3503
02:29:48,420 --> 02:29:48,980
Boom.

3504
02:29:48,980 --> 02:29:49,500
Richie.

3505
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:51,280
Double richie.

3506
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:53,480
It's so cute.

3507
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:54,060

So I merelyafley Did I know that this place would be my home,

3513
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:21,080
She is so cute.

3514
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:40,840
She is such an old man.

3515
02:30:50,140 --> 02:30:51,100
Robbing a con?

3516
02:30:51,700 --> 02:30:52,720
Under the sea?

3517
02:30:53,180 --> 02:30:54,220
Under the river?

3518
02:30:54,600 --> 02:30:55,880

3519
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:57,220
There are so many lines.

3520
02:31:00,320 --> 02:31:02,260
YouTuber Aura Holstox!

3521
02:31:02,980 --> 02:31:05,060
I luck sacked Mutsuki the other day.

02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:07,580

Oh my gosh, look how many there are.

3529
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:23,960
My brain is starting... Wait, Baiman?

3530
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:25,240
Sanbaiman?

3531
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:28,060
Haneman?

3532
02:31:28,060 --> 02:31:28,520
Mangan?

3533
02:31:28,900 --> 02:31:30,120
What is going on?

3534
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:33,440
There's so much.

3535
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:36,620
There's so... Holy cow.

3536
02:31:36,820 --> 02:31:38,140
How many voice lines are there?

3537
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:42,220
Check the Yaku list, please.

3538
02:31:42,260 --> 02:31:43,040
How do I find that?

3539
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:50,200
Look at her!

3540
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:51,060
So cute!

3541
02:31:51,700 --> 02:31:52,640
So cute, so cute!

3542
02:31:56,590 --> 02:31:57,310
Gasha!

3543
02:31:58,830 --> 02:31:59,550
Oh...

3544
02:31:59,550 --> 02:32:00,610
Uh...

3545
02:32:00,610 --> 02:32:01,450
Uh...

3546
02:32:01,450 --> 02:32:01,970
Gasha!

3547
02:32:04,790 --> 02:32:05,750
Me too.

3548
02:32:08,770 --> 02:32:10,430
Hold on, throw this over here real quick.

3549
02:32:16,690 --> 02:32:19,490
How tall is... How tall is Hoshimi?

3550
02:32:20,850 --> 02:32:21,270
Oh...

3551
02:32:25,070 --> 02:32:26,270
I'm too tall right now.

3552
02:32:27,310 --> 02:32:28,250
How tall is she?

3553
02:32:30,270 --> 02:32:31,630
Bring back the glasses!

3554
02:32:33,030 --> 02:32:33,570
Hold up.

3555
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:48,300
Almost the same height.

3556
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:49,220
145.

3557
02:32:49,400 --> 02:32:50,240
Oh, I'm a little taller.

3558
02:32:50,420 --> 02:32:52,200
So this should be kind of accurate, right?

3559
02:32:55,480 --> 02:32:56,500
Wait, wait, hold on.

3560
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:58,440
How do I do it?

3561
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:01,300
Hold on...

3562
02:33:05,440 --> 02:33:06,020
Hold on.

3563
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:08,920
How do I...

3564
02:33:08,920 --> 02:33:11,520
There's like a way that I can move my legs.

3565
02:33:13,160 --> 02:33:14,700
No, I moved myself too far.

3566
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:15,840
Too small.

3567
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:17,580
Like here.

3568
02:33:19,020 --> 02:33:20,140
Chicken wing arms?

3569
02:33:20,260 --> 02:33:21,280
What are you talking about?

3570
02:33:23,360 --> 02:33:24,440
What are you talking about?

3571
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:25,300
I can jump, you guys.

3572
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:25,760
Did you know that?

3573
02:33:26,080 --> 02:33:26,500
Wink!

3574
02:33:37,360 --> 02:33:37,800
Hooray!

3575
02:33:38,940 --> 02:33:39,540
I think

3576
02:33:48,690 --> 02:33:49,470
it's because I'm a ghost.

3577
02:33:49,690 --> 02:33:51,790
Here, let's do one arm up, one arm down.

3578
02:33:53,030 --> 02:33:54,010
Kind of like...

3579
02:33:54,010 --> 02:33:55,610
Wait, I want to be opposite of her.

3580
02:33:57,770 --> 02:33:58,210
Cheese!

3581
02:33:59,310 --> 02:33:59,750
Cheese!

3582
02:34:00,190 --> 02:34:00,630
Cheese!

3583
02:34:02,910 --> 02:34:03,350
Cheese!

3584
02:34:04,270 --> 02:34:06,350
Wait, I have to be kind of a sleepy face too.

3585
02:34:19,890 --> 02:34:20,890
What was that?

3586
02:34:21,070 --> 02:34:22,750
Oh, no, not the sticky keys.

3587
02:34:23,710 --> 02:34:24,770
That scared me.

3588
02:34:26,170 --> 02:34:26,830
Thank you!

3589
02:34:27,470 --> 02:34:28,630
Jump, ghost girl, jump!

3590
02:34:28,630 --> 02:34:30,790
Jump like your life depends on it!

3591
02:34:32,670 --> 02:34:35,470
Give me ten more jumping jacks!

3592
02:34:35,490 --> 02:34:36,490
Yes, sir!

3593
02:34:36,630 --> 02:34:37,710
Yes, sir!

3594
02:34:37,970 --> 02:34:38,470
Wait...

3595
02:34:41,970 --> 02:34:44,550
Yes, sir!

3596
02:34:45,150 --> 02:34:45,870
One!

3597
02:34:46,510 --> 02:34:47,230
Two!

3598
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:48,970
Three!

3599
02:34:50,330 --> 02:34:50,690
Four!

3600
02:35:01,650 --> 02:35:03,850
She's doing it, she's doing it!

3601
02:35:04,810 --> 02:35:05,530
She's doing it, she's doing it!

3602
02:35:06,450 --> 02:35:07,370
She's doing it, she's doing it!

3603
02:35:07,370 --> 02:35:07,990
I can beat, hold on.

3604
02:35:08,110 --> 02:35:09,210
You know what I'm going to beat?

3605
02:35:09,510 --> 02:35:12,590
I'm going to be the spooky ghost haunting Hoshino.

3606
02:35:13,190 --> 02:35:13,710
Hoshino.

3607
02:35:14,550 --> 02:35:17,090
Why is my gacha luck so bad, Hoshino?

3608
02:35:17,990 --> 02:35:20,890
I wanted Shiroko, I even wore her halo.

3609
02:35:23,110 --> 02:35:23,630
Hoshino.

3610
02:35:25,310 --> 02:35:25,830
Hoshino.

3611
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:39,000
You killed her.

3612
02:35:39,420 --> 02:35:39,940
Nope.

3613
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:42,660
I didn't kill anybody.

3614
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:47,780
There's my leg, you sticking out.

3615
02:35:56,220 --> 02:35:58,020
Now we're facing the same way.

3616
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:00,380
Yeah!

3617
02:36:05,300 --> 02:36:07,560
Well, you do have her halo, so she might be dead.

3618
02:36:07,740 --> 02:36:07,860
Oh.

3619
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:09,580
No!

3620
02:36:11,980 --> 02:36:13,440
She's literally sleeping.

3621
02:36:17,240 --> 02:36:18,340
How do I go back?

3622
02:36:20,480 --> 02:36:23,360
There we go.

3623
02:36:28,880 --> 02:36:29,660
That was fun.

3624
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:31,140
Little photoshoot time, right?

3625
02:36:32,460 --> 02:36:33,840
Little photoshoot time.

3626
02:36:38,820 --> 02:36:39,800
Sleeping forever.

3627
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:42,880
Why is your sleeve on Hoshino's chest?

3628
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:44,180
What chest?

3629
02:36:44,180 --> 02:36:44,440
Her chest.

3630
02:36:48,780 --> 02:36:50,200
Her chest, yeah.

3631
02:36:52,220 --> 02:36:52,720
Yeah.

3632
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:56,240
Wait, what if I save changes?

3633
02:36:57,080 --> 02:36:57,580
Oh!

3634
02:36:57,600 --> 02:36:58,600
It moves her to the middle!

3635
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:00,800
Oh, that's so cute, actually!

3636
02:37:00,920 --> 02:37:02,840
Wait, so I can move her around however I want?

3637
02:37:04,320 --> 02:37:05,620
So if I'm like...

3638
02:37:05,620 --> 02:37:06,260
Oh, yeah.

3639
02:37:06,320 --> 02:37:07,120
Hoshino's legs.

3640
02:37:09,940 --> 02:37:10,900
Pero pero pero!

3641
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:15,500
Click the question mark.

3642
02:37:15,660 --> 02:37:16,620
Ah, here we go!

3643
02:37:17,980 --> 02:37:22,760
Yeah, someone asked me about the... looking at the yakuza earlier.

3644
02:37:23,080 --> 02:37:29,040
All symbols, fully concealed hand, menzenchin only.

3645
02:37:31,820 --> 02:37:33,780
Win a hand by tsumo.

3646
02:37:34,380 --> 02:37:38,040
Drawing the winning tile at menzenchin, closed hand.

3647
02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:45,620
Seat wind.

3648
02:37:46,340 --> 02:37:47,180
Oh my gosh.

3649
02:38:00,780 --> 02:38:01,980
1, 2, 3.

3650
02:38:01,980 --> 02:38:02,700
2, 3, 4.

3651
02:38:02,880 --> 02:38:03,540
3, 4, 5.

3652
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:04,400
6, 6, 6.

3653
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:05,300
9, 9!

3654
02:38:08,620 --> 02:38:09,800
This looks impossible.

3655
02:38:11,420 --> 02:38:12,880
A full flush.

3656
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:14,660
Holy cow.

3657
02:38:26,370 --> 02:38:29,210
This seems like something I'm gonna have to really study.

3658
02:38:30,130 --> 02:38:31,670
Blessing of heaven, blessing of earth.

3659
02:38:31,810 --> 02:38:32,690
Big three dragons.

3660
02:38:33,290 --> 02:38:33,850
Wow.

3661
02:38:35,650 --> 02:38:36,730
Easier than you think?

3662
02:38:36,790 --> 02:38:37,050
Really?

3663
02:38:40,130 --> 02:38:41,610
Four concealed triplets.

3664
02:38:42,130 --> 02:38:43,530
What is a menzenchin?

3665
02:38:45,850 --> 02:38:47,490
Green dragon is not necessary.

3666
02:38:47,790 --> 02:38:49,790
Green dragon is necessary in my heart.

3667
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,160
A closed hand.

3668
02:38:58,520 --> 02:38:59,560
Welcome to membership.

3669
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:00,320
Thank you!

3670
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:03,300
Closed hand, no calls.

3671
02:39:10,320 --> 02:39:13,620
These were all the ones that had the different voice lines.

3672
02:39:14,380 --> 02:39:14,840
Okay.

3673
02:39:18,040 --> 02:39:19,700
Thank you again for the five gifted.

3674
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:20,220
Thank you!

3675
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:22,460
13 orphans is a myth.

3676
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:23,820
What would that be under?

3677
02:39:26,540 --> 02:39:27,460
Oh, there it is!

3678
02:39:28,040 --> 02:39:31,740
Win a hand with one of each 13 terminal tiles.

3679
02:39:31,740 --> 02:39:35,060
Plus any tile matches one of them.

3680
02:39:35,080 --> 02:39:35,240
Wait.

3681
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:41,320
Win a hand with one of each 13 terminal tiles.

3682
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:41,520
Oh!

3683
02:39:42,160 --> 02:39:44,000
Plus any tile matches one of them.

3684
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:50,840
So it's like opposite.

3685
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:56,580
It's the exact opposite of the simple one.

3686
02:39:56,980 --> 02:39:59,720
Because you can only get ones, nines.

3687
02:39:59,720 --> 02:40:01,480
And then the...

3688
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:05,920
The directional...

3689
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:09,200
The honorific ones, right?

3690
02:40:10,980 --> 02:40:11,440
Hmm...

3691
02:40:12,220 --> 02:40:14,780
What does it mean, plus any tile matches one of them?

3692
02:40:14,860 --> 02:40:15,760
What does that mean?

3693
02:40:23,930 --> 02:40:24,750
It's the pair?

3694
02:40:27,650 --> 02:40:28,950
Oh, the nine pair?

3695
02:40:29,150 --> 02:40:29,530
Here?

3696
02:40:30,330 --> 02:40:31,570
Ah, I see, I see.

3697
02:40:32,610 --> 02:40:33,530
Ah, okay, okay.

3698
02:40:33,670 --> 02:40:33,950
So...

3699
02:40:33,950 --> 02:40:35,970
But it's any tile matches one of them.

3700
02:40:36,030 --> 02:40:36,650
So if it's like...

3701
02:40:36,650 --> 02:40:37,870
If I have two...

3702
02:40:37,870 --> 02:40:40,130
Two wests, it would be fine.

3703
02:40:44,620 --> 02:40:45,860
Still any pair of any...

3704
02:40:45,860 --> 02:40:46,120
Okay.

3705
02:40:46,700 --> 02:40:47,520
Just one pair.

3706
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:48,540
Hmm...

3707
02:40:48,540 --> 02:40:49,800
Not all done, not all done.

3708
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:50,740
Oh my gosh!

3709
02:40:50,780 --> 02:40:52,600
I feel like I learned so much today.

3710
02:40:53,140 --> 02:40:53,920
Oh my god!

3711
02:40:54,040 --> 02:40:56,380
I feel like I actually learned so, so much.

3712
02:40:57,660 --> 02:40:58,840
Like I feel like...

3713
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:03,960
Maybe I couldn't win any game, but I could at least know a little bit of what I'm doing.

3714
02:41:03,960 --> 02:41:05,720
I learned so much!

3715
02:41:06,080 --> 02:41:06,900
For real!

3716
02:41:08,180 --> 02:41:09,520
I feel like I could...

3717
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:12,620
Now I'm going to watch Saki and I'm going to be like...

3718
02:41:12,620 --> 02:41:17,000
Going in with knowledge that I already know, so...

3719
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:18,560
The power of Blue Archive...

3720
02:41:18,560 --> 02:41:20,580
It only took Blue Archive to get me to learn...

3721
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:22,340
Oops, I forgot to change this...

3722
02:41:22,340 --> 02:41:23,100
To get...

3723
02:41:23,100 --> 02:41:24,900
It only took Blue Archive to learn me...

3724
02:41:24,900 --> 02:41:25,320
Learn...

3725
02:41:25,320 --> 02:41:25,860
For me...

3726
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:26,540
Learn...

3727
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:26,880
Wait...

3728
02:41:28,780 --> 02:41:29,900
It only...

3729
02:41:29,900 --> 02:41:30,880
Took...

3730
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:31,860
Blue...

3731
02:41:33,080 --> 02:41:33,640
Archive...

3732
02:41:33,640 --> 02:41:36,500
For me to learn Mahjong a little bit.

3733
02:41:42,680 --> 02:41:44,380
I do want to watch Akagi though.

3734
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:51,500
I have a couple friends that are really into Akagi, so...

3735
02:41:52,480 --> 02:41:53,300
Thank you!

3736
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:55,740
I think I know a little bit more about Mahjong now.

3737
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:56,380
Thanks for the stream!

3738
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:57,700
By the way, Arona or Plana?

3739
02:42:01,220 --> 02:42:02,340
I think Arona.

3740
02:42:04,140 --> 02:42:05,500
I think Arona for me.

3741
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:06,440
She's more my type.

3742
02:42:06,440 --> 02:42:08,280
She's very like...

3743
02:42:08,860 --> 02:42:10,480
Like very Rem-esque.

3744
02:42:10,620 --> 02:42:11,060
You know?

3745
02:42:11,140 --> 02:42:13,820
And I love Rem for...

3746
02:42:13,820 --> 02:42:18,620
I mean, I love Rem for everything, but like her looks are just so cute.

3747
02:42:21,320 --> 02:42:22,680
But I love Plana too.

3748
02:42:23,400 --> 02:42:25,700
Plana would never give Blue Albums.

3749
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:28,460
It's fun watching you learn Mahjong.

3750
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:29,040
Thanks for the stream.

3751
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:29,640
Thank you guys!

3752
02:42:29,860 --> 02:42:30,680
Thank you!

3753
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:32,960
Thank you!

3754
02:42:34,600 --> 02:42:35,120
Who?

3755
02:42:37,800 --> 02:42:37,880
Who?

3756
02:42:37,880 --> 02:42:37,940
Oops.

3757
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:38,640
Haha.

3758
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,040
Ho ho ho.

3759
02:42:40,300 --> 02:42:41,460
Hee hee hee.

3760
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:43,700
Ha ha ha hee.

3761
02:42:43,940 --> 02:42:45,500
How do you feel about Shiroko Terror?

3762
02:42:46,780 --> 02:42:49,060
I like her, but I like normal Shiroko more.

3763
02:42:50,500 --> 02:42:51,480
Fresh joke.

3764
02:42:51,820 --> 02:42:52,800
Very fresh.

3765
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,100
There's Mahjong in nearly every Yakuza game?

3766
02:42:56,280 --> 02:42:58,740
Oh, then I need to study even more for whenever I play...

3767
02:42:58,740 --> 02:43:00,040
For whenever I play...

3768
02:43:01,160 --> 02:43:01,680
Yakuza!

3769
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:03,560
Arona.

3770
02:43:03,780 --> 02:43:05,280
All Blues, One Gold.

3771
02:43:05,420 --> 02:43:07,540
Stop showing my...

3772
02:43:07,540 --> 02:43:08,520
Actual polls.

3773
02:43:08,860 --> 02:43:09,800
Who's Rem?

3774
02:43:12,380 --> 02:43:14,420
Have you read Volume Final?

3775
02:43:14,620 --> 02:43:15,380
I have, I have.

3776
02:43:16,760 --> 02:43:17,560
Yes, yes.

3777
02:43:18,100 --> 02:43:21,140
Will you be streaming your future Blue Archive polls?

3778
02:43:22,520 --> 02:43:27,980
Probably not because I play Blue Archive like on my actual phone.

3779
02:43:29,720 --> 02:43:31,840
I think I would feel a little naked.

3780
02:43:32,100 --> 02:43:37,520
I would feel a little too like nervous because it's like my actual phone phone.

3781
02:43:37,540 --> 02:43:37,840
You know?

3782
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:38,500
Like...

3783
02:43:40,060 --> 02:43:40,860
It's uh...

3784
02:43:41,420 --> 02:43:42,060
I don't know.

3785
02:43:42,580 --> 02:43:44,240
It would make me feel...

3786
02:43:46,120 --> 02:43:46,520
Like...

3787
02:43:46,520 --> 02:43:46,900
Oh my gosh.

3788
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:47,340
What if I...

3789
02:43:47,340 --> 02:43:49,000
What if I accidentally like close out?

3790
02:43:49,140 --> 02:43:50,160
Then you guys can see...

3791
02:43:50,820 --> 02:43:52,280
Everything that's on my...

3792
02:43:52,760 --> 02:43:53,800
Well, not that I have...

3793
02:43:53,800 --> 02:43:55,300
I don't really have anything on my...

3794
02:43:55,800 --> 02:43:56,500
Home screen.

3795
02:43:56,900 --> 02:43:57,840
That would be bad.

3796
02:43:58,680 --> 02:43:59,080
Um...

3797
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:01,980
I have all my gacha games which are in a folder called Hell.

3798
02:44:02,820 --> 02:44:03,220
Um...

3799
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:05,580
Eating Mike Tyson's ass!

3800
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:07,280
Wow!

3801
02:44:07,340 --> 02:44:07,520
That's...

3802
02:44:07,800 --> 02:44:08,840
Thank you for the five gifted.

3803
02:44:08,920 --> 02:44:09,420
Thank you!

3804
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:15,380
But if I ever get any good polls, of course I'll show you guys or I'll post them on um...

3805
02:44:16,040 --> 02:44:17,640
I'll post them on Twitter or something.

3806
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:21,940
I only have three games in Hell.

3807
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:25,620
I have Blue Archive, Toho Lost Word, and Yuru Camp.

3808
02:44:27,720 --> 02:44:28,160
Um...

3809
02:44:28,980 --> 02:44:30,800
And then I have my Webtoons.

3810
02:44:31,380 --> 02:44:31,820
Um...

3811
02:44:31,820 --> 02:44:32,160
I have...

3812
02:44:32,160 --> 02:44:33,060
I can delete this app.

3813
02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:35,340
It's a taxi app from when I was in Japan.

3814
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:37,500
I have Meow Tower which is a noob app.

3815
02:44:37,500 --> 02:44:42,300
And then I have like social stuff which is like TikTok, Discord, YouTube.

3816
02:44:44,540 --> 02:44:47,920
But my screen is actually quite cute because I have it...

3817
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:49,400
I kind of want to show you guys now.

3818
02:44:51,480 --> 02:44:51,760
Because...

3819
02:44:52,040 --> 02:44:52,540
Um...

3820
02:44:52,540 --> 02:44:55,200
But I also have like my location on here like uh...

3821
02:44:55,760 --> 02:44:56,320
Um...

3822
02:44:56,320 --> 02:44:59,940
Like you know, the weather in my town and the time and everything.

3823
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:03,480
But I have pictures of like um...

3824
02:45:04,940 --> 02:45:06,020
Of uh...

3825
02:45:06,920 --> 02:45:07,480
Like...

3826
02:45:07,500 --> 02:45:08,360
I have Arona.

3827
02:45:08,600 --> 02:45:08,740
Here.

3828
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:10,560
Maybe I can like screenshot it.

3829
02:45:10,580 --> 02:45:10,800
Hold on.

3830
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:14,240
Let me find something that won't be so...

3831
02:45:14,240 --> 02:45:14,740
If I...

3832
02:45:14,740 --> 02:45:14,920
Okay.

3833
02:45:14,940 --> 02:45:16,960
If I screenshot this and then black out everything.

3834
02:45:20,780 --> 02:45:21,140
Okay.

3835
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:21,420
Hold on.

3836
02:45:23,540 --> 02:45:24,320
I'll show you guys.

3837
02:45:24,400 --> 02:45:25,920
Actually, I'm just gonna delete these apps.

3838
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:27,120
And then I'll show you.

3839
02:45:28,740 --> 02:45:29,100
Remove...

3840
02:45:32,880 --> 02:45:33,240
Screenshot.

3841
02:45:35,540 --> 02:45:35,900
Oh.

3842
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,900
Actually, I'll move the other pictures that I have too even though they're on another page.

3843
02:45:39,080 --> 02:45:39,420
Okay.

3844
02:45:39,420 --> 02:45:42,320
I like really customized my um...

3845
02:45:43,300 --> 02:45:44,300
My uh...

3846
02:45:44,300 --> 02:45:45,940
Home screen and stuff.

3847
02:45:46,300 --> 02:45:47,940
So it's like super duper cute.

3848
02:45:48,760 --> 02:45:49,260
Chaka.

3849
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:50,020
Okay.

3850
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:04,320
Everything should be good.

3851
02:46:04,980 --> 02:46:07,360
I'm gonna censor out a couple things real quick.

3852
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:09,620
Skip.

3853
02:46:19,440 --> 02:46:20,100
Oh wait.

3854
02:46:20,260 --> 02:46:20,960
There we go.

3855
02:46:21,040 --> 02:46:21,260
Okay.

3856
02:46:21,440 --> 02:46:21,940
Uh...

3857
02:46:21,940 --> 02:46:22,640
Actually, it's okay.

3858
02:46:22,780 --> 02:46:23,960
Because I'm just on Wi-Fi.

3859
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:26,620
Okay.

3860
02:46:27,420 --> 02:46:28,160
Let me...

3861
02:46:28,160 --> 02:46:28,460
Okay.

3862
02:46:28,460 --> 02:46:28,620
Let me...

3863
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:29,340
Send this to myself.

3864
02:46:36,480 --> 02:46:37,740
How do I send this to my...

3865
02:46:37,740 --> 02:46:37,840
Oh.

3866
02:46:37,840 --> 02:46:37,980
Here.

3867
02:46:40,280 --> 02:46:42,160
I'm proud of my home screen.

3868
02:46:42,360 --> 02:46:42,960
It's so cute.

3869
02:46:47,350 --> 02:46:49,990
Have you played the Touhou Rhythm game, Danmaku Kagura?

3870
02:46:50,250 --> 02:46:52,130
It used to be a mobile game but now it's a PC.

3871
02:46:52,250 --> 02:46:53,050
I haven't actually.

3872
02:46:54,030 --> 02:46:55,050
I haven't actually.

3873
02:46:56,590 --> 02:46:57,070
Uh...

3874
02:46:57,070 --> 02:46:58,150
Let me...

3875
02:46:59,150 --> 02:47:00,110
Get this.

3876
02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:08,160
Close.

3877
02:47:09,960 --> 02:47:10,440
Save.

3878
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:11,280
Okay.

3879
02:47:11,300 --> 02:47:11,620
Okay.

3880
02:47:11,700 --> 02:47:12,220
Screenshot.

3881
02:47:21,360 --> 02:47:28,680
My screen is so aesthetic but I was thinking of changing it recently anyway so that's why I'm fine with showing you guys.

3882
02:47:32,400 --> 02:47:34,160
So like you can set up...

3883
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:34,660
So basically...

3884
02:47:34,660 --> 02:47:35,480
See how I like...

3885
02:47:35,480 --> 02:47:36,060
There's the pictures.

3886
02:47:36,380 --> 02:47:37,680
I have...

3887
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:38,020
Um...

3888
02:47:38,020 --> 02:47:39,280
I have...

3889
02:47:39,280 --> 02:47:39,880
Uh...

3890
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:41,640
It's...

3891
02:47:41,640 --> 02:47:41,980
It's...

3892
02:47:41,980 --> 02:47:49,360
Like you put it in a note app and then you can like set the notes as like a picture like on your screen.

3893
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:49,620
Um...

3894
02:47:49,620 --> 02:47:53,600
So I like have it all aesthetic and all set up and cute and...

3895
02:47:54,300 --> 02:47:55,040
It's not...

3896
02:47:55,040 --> 02:47:57,280
It's not usually like set up like this.

3897
02:47:57,540 --> 02:47:58,320
Like the...

3898
02:47:58,320 --> 02:48:01,120
The Arona picture is on like the second page of my...

3899
02:48:01,120 --> 02:48:03,560
Of my screen but...

3900
02:48:03,560 --> 02:48:04,480
Um...

3901
02:48:04,480 --> 02:48:06,720
It's usually just kind of like this.

3902
02:48:06,940 --> 02:48:08,180
It's so cute, right?

3903
02:48:09,460 --> 02:48:11,560
I think I'm gonna redo it for summer.

3904
02:48:12,620 --> 02:48:13,140
So...

3905
02:48:13,940 --> 02:48:15,560
Meow Tower is so base.

3906
02:48:15,640 --> 02:48:16,580
It's so fun!

3907
02:48:17,340 --> 02:48:18,940
I play it every day.

3908
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:20,680
Koharu love.

3909
02:48:20,780 --> 02:48:21,240
Isn't it cute?

3910
02:48:21,660 --> 02:48:23,040
Isn't it like the cutest picture ever?

3911
02:48:24,280 --> 02:48:24,800
Yeah.

3912
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:26,640
This is my...

3913
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:28,340
This is inspo for you guys.

3914
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:30,280
Make your wallpaper or make your...

3915
02:48:30,280 --> 02:48:31,120
Your...

3916
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:33,700
Your thing so cute.

3917
02:48:35,540 --> 02:48:36,920
You use your stylus?

3918
02:48:37,020 --> 02:48:37,300
Yeah!

3919
02:48:37,380 --> 02:48:38,580
That's why I bought the...

3920
02:48:38,580 --> 02:48:40,820
The Samsung Ultra.

3921
02:48:40,860 --> 02:48:42,620
I use my stylus all the time.

3922
02:48:42,620 --> 02:48:44,180
Especially for Nonograms.

3923
02:48:44,180 --> 02:48:45,560
It's perfect for Meow Tower.

3924
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:47,600
It's actually so, so perfect.

3925
02:48:47,860 --> 02:48:49,580
I got hooked on Meow Tower after you made it.

3926
02:48:49,580 --> 02:48:50,340
I mentioned it on the pod.

3927
02:48:50,820 --> 02:48:51,340
Yeah.

3928
02:48:53,720 --> 02:48:54,240
Yeah...

3929
02:48:57,390 --> 02:48:59,370
138 Notifications SMH.

3930
02:48:59,630 --> 02:49:01,050
I don't know actually...

3931
02:49:01,050 --> 02:49:02,670
Let's see what most of that is from.

3932
02:49:04,250 --> 02:49:06,310
Most of it is actually from line.

3933
02:49:08,490 --> 02:49:10,990
because I follow a bunch of like brand accounts online.

3934
02:49:11,750 --> 02:49:13,130
So it's just like...

3935
02:49:13,130 --> 02:49:13,230
Oh!

3936
02:49:13,350 --> 02:49:14,130
This brand...

3937
02:49:14,130 --> 02:49:15,050
This like...

3938
02:49:16,670 --> 02:49:20,030
This clothing brand sent me a thing.

3939
02:49:20,410 --> 02:49:21,030
So it's to be more specific.

3940
02:49:21,030 --> 02:49:21,770
Oh, it's mostly from those.

3941
02:49:25,460 --> 02:49:27,320
I cannot live without my stylist.

3942
02:49:27,500 --> 02:49:27,800
Me too!

3943
02:49:30,680 --> 02:49:32,720
I also use Samsung Note.

3944
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:34,620
Let's see.

3945
02:49:34,820 --> 02:49:36,280
I'm gonna put this back.

3946
02:49:41,280 --> 02:49:45,280
But usually at the top I have like a clock.

3947
02:49:45,820 --> 02:49:49,180
And then I also have like a clock widget.

3948
02:49:49,180 --> 02:49:53,400
And I also have like one that... what's the word?

3949
02:49:54,040 --> 02:49:55,740
Converts the time to Tokyo.

3950
02:49:56,100 --> 02:49:57,000
Like one of those.

3951
02:49:57,900 --> 02:49:59,160
Actually, where is that?

3952
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:00,720
And I have a weather one.

3953
02:50:00,880 --> 02:50:02,760
Which I'm setting up again right now.

3954
02:50:04,600 --> 02:50:05,380
This one.

3955
02:50:17,890 --> 02:50:19,850
Uh oh, my thing's all messed up now.

3956
02:50:20,570 --> 02:50:21,250
Oh well.

3957
02:50:23,690 --> 02:50:25,790
But yeah, I love my phone.

3958
02:50:26,310 --> 02:50:28,270
I wish I could have gotten the Blue Archive...

3959
02:50:29,510 --> 02:50:31,270
The Blue Archive one though.

3960
02:50:31,450 --> 02:50:32,410
I'm so sad about it.

3961
02:50:32,430 --> 02:50:35,870
Like there was a special edition Blue Archive phone that I couldn't get.

3962
02:50:37,610 --> 02:50:38,090
So...

3963
02:50:38,950 --> 02:50:40,690
I rotate through wallpapers too.

3964
02:50:41,150 --> 02:50:43,870
Too much to keep a unique icon theme.

3965
02:50:44,070 --> 02:50:44,230
Really?

3966
02:50:44,370 --> 02:50:47,190
I like this one because it's kind of hard to tell but...

3967
02:50:48,950 --> 02:50:49,910
Down here...

3968
02:50:49,910 --> 02:50:52,010
You see like the different pages?

3969
02:50:52,430 --> 02:50:53,790
They're actually heart shapes.

3970
02:50:54,190 --> 02:50:55,650
And then when I like...

3971
02:50:55,650 --> 02:50:55,970
Um...

3972
02:50:55,970 --> 02:50:57,090
My whole thing is like...

3973
02:50:57,090 --> 02:50:59,750
All my texts and everything are like...

3974
02:50:59,750 --> 02:51:00,470
Um...

3975
02:51:00,470 --> 02:51:02,190
I don't have anything that I could like...

3976
02:51:02,190 --> 02:51:04,290
I would have to block out like everything.

3977
02:51:04,510 --> 02:51:06,030
If I were to show you my texts.

3978
02:51:06,110 --> 02:51:09,330
But like it's a theme that like makes everything hearts and cherries.

3979
02:51:09,430 --> 02:51:11,530
And it's like a purple gingham theme.

3980
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:12,450
It's super duper cute.

3981
02:51:17,070 --> 02:51:17,550
So...

3982
02:51:18,470 --> 02:51:18,950
Yeah.

3983
02:51:20,930 --> 02:51:21,410
Weee!

3984
02:51:24,540 --> 02:51:27,040
The Go app is Go Taxi in Japan.

3985
02:51:27,040 --> 02:51:28,040
If you...

3986
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:30,720
I recommend getting that if you...

3987
02:51:30,720 --> 02:51:31,160
If you...

3988
02:51:31,160 --> 02:51:31,740
Well...

3989
02:51:31,740 --> 02:51:32,760
If you use taxis.

3990
02:51:32,780 --> 02:51:34,320
I only used it a couple times.

3991
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:35,800
Actually I only...

3992
02:51:35,800 --> 02:51:37,040
I really downloaded it.

3993
02:51:37,260 --> 02:51:37,780
Um...

3994
02:51:37,780 --> 02:51:39,060
Because I prefer taking the train.

3995
02:51:39,260 --> 02:51:41,160
Because first of all taxis are so expensive.

3996
02:51:41,940 --> 02:51:42,460
Um...

3997
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:43,520
But...

3998
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:43,980
Uh...

3999
02:51:43,980 --> 02:51:45,400
I used it...

4000
02:51:45,400 --> 02:51:45,960
Um...

4001
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:49,120
I only downloaded it closer to the end of my trip.

4002
02:51:49,180 --> 02:51:51,020
Because I needed to get a taxi...

4003
02:51:51,020 --> 02:51:51,800
Uh...

4004
02:51:51,800 --> 02:51:52,640
To the airport.

4005
02:51:52,980 --> 02:51:53,500
And...

4006
02:51:53,500 --> 02:51:56,940
There were no taxis that would like come to my apartment.

4007
02:51:56,940 --> 02:51:57,020
So...

4008
02:51:57,920 --> 02:51:58,480
Hmm...

4009
02:51:58,480 --> 02:52:00,260
Is hell all your gacha games?

4010
02:52:00,520 --> 02:52:01,080
Yeah.

4011
02:52:03,600 --> 02:52:04,160
Yeah.

4012
02:52:08,120 --> 02:52:09,660
Drop the keyboard theme?

4013
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:18,040
It's just normal.

4014
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:19,820
It's like...

4015
02:52:19,820 --> 02:52:20,480
It's so...

4016
02:52:20,480 --> 02:52:21,240
It's just normal.

4017
02:52:23,660 --> 02:52:26,800
It's relatively easy to get taxis at most train stations though.

4018
02:52:26,920 --> 02:52:27,140
Yeah.

4019
02:52:27,140 --> 02:52:28,720
But I wasn't close to a train station.

4020
02:52:28,980 --> 02:52:31,400
My apartment was quite far actually.

4021
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:32,060
So...

4022
02:52:32,060 --> 02:52:32,200
So...

4023
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:32,340
But...

4024
02:52:33,010 --> 02:52:33,260
Um...

4025
02:52:33,260 --> 02:52:35,660
There was a close-ish train station.

4026
02:52:35,960 --> 02:52:36,460
But...

4027
02:52:36,460 --> 02:52:37,400
Um...

4028
02:52:38,160 --> 02:52:38,940
Oh my god.

4029
02:52:39,020 --> 02:52:39,920
Getting my...

4030
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:42,660
Getting my suitcases down the stairs...

4031
02:52:42,660 --> 02:52:44,160
Was actual...

4032
02:52:44,160 --> 02:52:45,180
I thought...

4033
02:52:45,180 --> 02:52:46,980
I almost fell down the stairs at one point.

4034
02:52:47,020 --> 02:52:48,840
I thought I was actually going to pass away.

4035
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:50,140
A second time.

4036
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:52,420
I was like...

4037
02:52:52,420 --> 02:52:53,020
Oh my god.

4038
02:52:53,440 --> 02:52:53,940
I...

4039
02:52:53,940 --> 02:52:54,560
I was fall...

4040
02:52:54,560 --> 02:52:56,140
I was falling in slow motion.

4041
02:52:57,840 --> 02:52:59,140
Very small things.

4042
02:52:59,220 --> 02:53:00,060
Welcome to Peppership.

4043
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:00,640
Thank you.

4044
02:53:00,800 --> 02:53:01,300
Thank you.

4045
02:53:01,300 --> 02:53:01,600
Thank you.

4046
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:01,620
Thank you.

4047
02:53:01,620 --> 02:53:01,700
Thank you.

4048
02:53:02,820 --> 02:53:03,380
Yeah.

4049
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:04,620
That was pretty bad.

4050
02:53:09,320 --> 02:53:12,000
Getting suitcases down to Tokyo Subway is an experience.

4051
02:53:12,260 --> 02:53:14,100
I should have probably just...

4052
02:53:15,660 --> 02:53:17,740
How many times does Mint have to die?

4053
02:53:18,220 --> 02:53:20,620
I probably should have just like...

4054
02:53:21,400 --> 02:53:22,600
Kuroneko'd them to...

4055
02:53:22,600 --> 02:53:23,460
The...

4056
02:53:23,460 --> 02:53:24,240
To...

4057
02:53:24,240 --> 02:53:24,920
The airport.

4058
02:53:25,380 --> 02:53:25,940
But...

4059
02:53:26,860 --> 02:53:27,660
It's fine.

4060
02:53:28,140 --> 02:53:30,300
Can't you just phase your luggage to the floor?

4061
02:53:30,420 --> 02:53:31,160
I'm a ghost.

4062
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:32,820
Not my luggage.

4063
02:53:32,880 --> 02:53:33,420
Haha.

4064
02:53:34,440 --> 02:53:35,760
Not my luggage.

4065
02:53:46,430 --> 02:53:47,030
Kuroneko.

4066
02:53:47,670 --> 02:53:48,670
It's ah...

4067
02:53:50,110 --> 02:53:51,030
It's a...

4068
02:53:52,170 --> 02:53:52,770
Oh.

4069
02:53:52,870 --> 02:53:53,810
A shipping service.

4070
02:53:54,510 --> 02:53:55,810
It's a shipping service.

4071
02:53:56,250 --> 02:53:56,850
Yeah.

4072
02:53:58,390 --> 02:53:59,630
Laughs at Danny Phantom.

4073
02:53:59,970 --> 02:54:00,190
Yeah.

4074
02:54:00,230 --> 02:54:02,650
You wouldn't imagine how many things Danny Phantom gets wrong.

4075
02:54:10,860 --> 02:54:11,800
That's all good.

4076
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:15,600
I was always too stubborn or too strict.

4077
02:54:15,600 --> 02:54:17,180
It's not cheap to use Kuroneko for stuff like that.

4078
02:54:19,140 --> 02:54:20,880
I thought you were talking about Ore Imo.

4079
02:54:24,120 --> 02:54:30,160
Took the Yohane taxi to the Awashima hotel dock in Numazu last month after I missed the bus and saw it waiting there.

4080
02:54:30,260 --> 02:54:30,920
It was a sign.

4081
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:31,280
You know what?

4082
02:54:31,380 --> 02:54:34,160
That's the most proper time to use a taxi ever.

4083
02:54:39,240 --> 02:54:42,040
That's like the most proper time to use a taxi ever.

4084
02:54:45,740 --> 02:54:56,160
Also, I've had to use a taxi when I was out too late at one time and the trains had stopped.

4085
02:54:56,800 --> 02:54:59,960
So I had to take a taxi home and the guy...

4086
02:55:01,340 --> 02:55:03,960
The taxi driver was so judgmental.

4087
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:06,440
Because he was like...

4088
02:55:06,440 --> 02:55:07,540
He was like...

4089
02:55:07,540 --> 02:55:09,760
Why did you stay out so late?

4090
02:55:10,780 --> 02:55:13,400
You know how expensive this taxi is now?

4091
02:55:13,580 --> 02:55:15,480
You could have gotten yourself a good stay.

4092
02:55:18,320 --> 02:55:18,920
You could have gotten yourself a good stay.

4093
02:55:18,920 --> 02:55:19,360
I was like...

4094
02:55:19,360 --> 02:55:20,720
Sir, I need to go home.

4095
02:55:22,140 --> 02:55:23,540
It's not my fault.

4096
02:55:26,480 --> 02:55:28,300
Bank account mad at me right now.

4097
02:55:28,400 --> 02:55:31,160
Please, stop donating.

4098
02:55:34,560 --> 02:55:38,120
But it was a time I stayed out for...

4099
02:55:39,440 --> 02:55:43,300
I stayed out because I went to see...

4100
02:55:43,960 --> 02:55:44,740
What's it called?

4101
02:55:46,880 --> 02:55:48,580
Inotak and Daoko.

4102
02:55:49,140 --> 02:55:51,040
And some other DJs.

4103
02:55:51,040 --> 02:55:52,980
So obviously at DJ events.

4104
02:55:54,660 --> 02:55:58,140
I never stayed late for Mogra though.

4105
02:55:58,360 --> 02:56:01,660
I always left before the final train when I went to Mogra though.

4106
02:56:01,720 --> 02:56:02,360
Because...

4107
02:56:03,940 --> 02:56:07,180
My apartment was really far from Akiba.

4108
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:09,520
It was so sad because I...

4109
02:56:10,700 --> 02:56:14,140
Because I barely went to Akiba when I last...

4110
02:56:14,800 --> 02:56:17,300
When I last was in Japan.

4111
02:56:17,620 --> 02:56:19,180
Because I was always so far away.

4112
02:56:21,820 --> 02:56:22,780
And also...

4113
02:56:22,780 --> 02:56:24,020
I'm also an old lady.

4114
02:56:24,220 --> 02:56:25,480
I can't stay out so late.

4115
02:56:27,780 --> 02:56:28,740
I stay...

4116
02:56:28,740 --> 02:56:29,200
I usually...

4117
02:56:29,200 --> 02:56:30,180
If I stay out late...

4118
02:56:30,180 --> 02:56:32,140
It's like the latest is like 3 a.m.

4119
02:56:32,140 --> 02:56:33,600
Which is still pretty late.

4120
02:56:33,720 --> 02:56:35,920
I don't like to ruin my sleep schedule so much.

4121
02:56:36,380 --> 02:56:38,900
Where I'm like up at first train.

4122
02:56:39,340 --> 02:56:39,980
You know?

4123
02:56:39,980 --> 02:56:40,000
You know?

4124
02:56:43,700 --> 02:56:44,600
3 a.m.

4125
02:56:44,620 --> 02:56:45,220
is pretty late.

4126
02:56:45,320 --> 02:56:45,900
It is.

4127
02:56:46,140 --> 02:56:46,620
But...

4128
02:56:49,100 --> 02:56:49,580
But...

4129
02:56:49,580 --> 02:56:50,660
It's not as bad.

4130
02:56:50,860 --> 02:56:51,900
Do better, Vtuber.

4131
02:56:53,060 --> 02:56:53,580
What's that?

4132
02:56:53,700 --> 02:56:54,140
We're donating?

4133
02:56:54,340 --> 02:56:54,600
No!

4134
02:56:58,710 --> 02:56:59,890
And 3 a.m.

4135
02:56:59,890 --> 02:57:00,250
is like...

4136
02:57:00,250 --> 02:57:01,730
Is like...

4137
02:57:02,430 --> 02:57:03,390
Is like...

4138
02:57:04,290 --> 02:57:05,710
The latest I'll do.

4139
02:57:06,230 --> 02:57:06,830
You know?

4140
02:57:08,270 --> 02:57:10,270
Maybe I am Oji-san if 3 a.m.

4141
02:57:10,270 --> 02:57:10,750
isn't late.

4142
02:57:13,630 --> 02:57:15,310
No, everyone that says 3 a.m.

4143
02:57:15,310 --> 02:57:16,530
is late is also Oji-san.

4144
02:57:19,570 --> 02:57:21,070
Everyone that says 3 a.m.

4145
02:57:21,070 --> 02:57:22,290
is late is also Oji-san.

4146
02:57:23,570 --> 02:57:25,510
Some people are naturally night owls.

4147
02:57:25,630 --> 02:57:26,690
I get all my...

4148
02:57:26,690 --> 02:57:29,810
I get all my work done at night usually.

4149
02:57:29,890 --> 02:57:30,210
You know?

4150
02:57:31,030 --> 02:57:31,470
So...

4151
02:57:33,710 --> 02:57:34,250
It's okay.

4152
02:57:34,350 --> 02:57:35,350
We can be Oji-san together.

4153
02:57:36,170 --> 02:57:37,510
I'm Oji-san and I'm proud.

4154
02:57:37,830 --> 02:57:38,270
Yeah!

4155
02:57:39,310 --> 02:57:41,070
Putting my luck into this PayPal.

4156
02:57:41,070 --> 02:57:42,110
Time capsule.

4157
02:57:42,790 --> 02:57:44,530
So Vid can have some...

4158
02:57:45,070 --> 02:57:46,470
Why am I so big?

4159
02:57:46,630 --> 02:57:49,510
Some lucky poles when this Dodo finally reaches her.

4160
02:57:49,710 --> 02:57:50,530
Thank you, Gopal.

4161
02:57:50,630 --> 02:57:52,030
I'll use that in Blue Archive.

4162
02:57:54,810 --> 02:57:56,250
I'll use it in Blue Archive.

4163
02:57:56,250 --> 02:57:56,830
Thank you.

4164
02:57:57,970 --> 02:58:00,690
I haven't spent so much in Blue Archive.

4165
02:58:01,390 --> 02:58:01,910
Maybe...

4166
02:58:01,910 --> 02:58:04,070
I've spent less than $100 in Blue Archive.

4167
02:58:04,190 --> 02:58:04,910
For sure.

4168
02:58:05,450 --> 02:58:07,930
Probably even less than $50 in Blue Archive.

4169
02:58:10,030 --> 02:58:10,550
So...

4170
02:58:13,010 --> 02:58:14,130
Not that much.

4171
02:58:15,430 --> 02:58:16,290
Not that much.

4172
02:58:16,350 --> 02:58:16,750
Not that much.

4173
02:58:17,270 --> 02:58:19,250
Are you going to be chasing for the Railgun collab?

4174
02:58:20,190 --> 02:58:21,070
I don't know.

4175
02:58:21,070 --> 02:58:21,730
I want to.

4176
02:58:22,570 --> 02:58:23,050
Because...

4177
02:58:23,990 --> 02:58:25,210
Because she'll never come...

4178
02:58:25,210 --> 02:58:26,010
They'll never come back.

4179
02:58:26,970 --> 02:58:28,510
But at the same time...

4180
02:58:29,010 --> 02:58:30,290
I really want Dress Hina.

4181
02:58:31,130 --> 02:58:32,270
So I'm like...

4182
02:58:34,190 --> 02:58:35,110
What do I do?

4183
02:58:35,850 --> 02:58:38,070
I save for Dress Hina or...

4184
02:58:40,470 --> 02:58:42,270
Did you get Miku?

4185
02:58:42,430 --> 02:58:42,790
No.

4186
02:58:43,630 --> 02:58:45,170
I didn't get Miku.

4187
02:58:46,850 --> 02:58:48,330
I missed Miku.

4188
02:58:53,110 --> 02:58:53,710
So...

4189
02:58:59,970 --> 02:59:00,710
we'll see.

4190
02:59:02,690 --> 02:59:03,790
I got Miku.

4191
02:59:03,830 --> 02:59:04,590
She's kinda bad.

4192
02:59:04,850 --> 02:59:05,090
Really?

4193
02:59:06,310 --> 02:59:08,270
Yeah, I know Dress Hina is permanent.

4194
02:59:09,950 --> 02:59:11,050
I don't know.

4195
02:59:11,950 --> 02:59:12,910
I don't know.

4196
02:59:14,030 --> 02:59:16,350
I feel like when they do limit... like...

4197
02:59:17,890 --> 02:59:18,930
Thank you!

4198
02:59:22,090 --> 02:59:24,590
What if instead of trains and taxis, motorcycle?

4199
02:59:26,930 --> 02:59:28,190
Like taking a motorcycle?

4200
02:59:32,860 --> 02:59:35,300
I'm even too afraid to ride a bike in Japan.

4201
02:59:35,560 --> 02:59:36,240
Not gonna lie.

4202
02:59:38,400 --> 02:59:40,680
I'm too afraid to ride a bike.

4203
02:59:41,080 --> 02:59:43,220
I'll never drive anything.

4204
02:59:43,460 --> 02:59:44,560
I will walk everywhere.

4205
02:59:48,600 --> 02:59:49,080
Thank you!

4206
02:59:49,080 --> 02:59:54,960
But... I feel like for characters that are like limited where they're...

4207
02:59:56,160 --> 02:59:59,000
Where they're... like they'll never come back.

4208
02:59:59,140 --> 03:00:01,820
Like Miku or the Railgun collab.

4209
03:00:02,080 --> 03:00:02,620
Stuff like that.

4210
03:00:02,800 --> 03:00:07,320
I feel like they don't make them on... make them very good on purpose because... like...

4211
03:00:08,220 --> 03:00:09,000
I don't know.

4212
03:00:09,240 --> 03:00:14,460
Because if you get them and you miss out... or rather if you miss out like...

4213
03:00:14,460 --> 03:00:15,220
I don't know.

4214
03:00:15,220 --> 03:00:15,220
Because if you get them and you miss out...

4215
03:00:15,220 --> 03:00:15,220
or rather if you miss out like...

4216
03:00:15,220 --> 03:00:18,220
It would be so sad missing out on such a good character.

4217
03:00:18,520 --> 03:00:18,940
You know what I mean?

4218
03:00:21,380 --> 03:00:24,040
And the same mentality until I needed to get a license?

4219
03:00:24,280 --> 03:00:26,740
I drive... here!

4220
03:00:27,720 --> 03:00:29,540
But I don't drive in Japan.

4221
03:00:37,450 --> 03:00:39,970
Black Rock Shooter in PGR is also pretty weak.

4222
03:00:41,650 --> 03:00:42,210
Yeah...

4223
03:00:48,320 --> 03:00:50,060
What do you mean Stinky Minto?

4224
03:00:58,460 --> 03:01:00,380
But the scenes though... true.

4225
03:01:01,760 --> 03:01:02,360
But the scenes though...

4226
03:01:02,360 --> 03:01:02,360
true.

4227
03:01:02,360 --> 03:01:03,860
Oh my gosh, did you guys see...

4228
03:01:04,440 --> 03:01:08,020
With the ReZero collab for Nikkei...

4229
03:01:08,020 --> 03:01:11,120
Okay, when I saw like the previews for it...

4230
03:01:11,120 --> 03:01:14,460
I was... I was actually... pretty disappointed.

4231
03:01:15,980 --> 03:01:17,540
I was like...

4232
03:01:17,540 --> 03:01:19,980
Some coin for the Rail Dress Cup button.

4233
03:01:20,180 --> 03:01:20,460
Stop!

4234
03:01:22,200 --> 03:01:23,300
Stop it, please.

4235
03:01:23,420 --> 03:01:26,540
If you ever feel the need to donate, never donate because of gacha.

4236
03:01:26,800 --> 03:01:28,280
It makes me feel so dirty.

4237
03:01:33,320 --> 03:01:34,000
But...

4238
03:01:34,900 --> 03:01:38,960
I was so disappointed by the ReZero because...

4239
03:01:38,960 --> 03:01:40,620
Where's the jiggle?

4240
03:01:41,420 --> 03:01:42,740
Where's the jiggle?

4241
03:01:43,700 --> 03:01:45,880
That's all Nikkei is.

4242
03:01:46,320 --> 03:01:47,200
Well, not all.

4243
03:01:47,380 --> 03:01:48,060
But it's a lot.

4244
03:01:48,840 --> 03:01:50,240
Just no jiggle.

4245
03:01:50,380 --> 03:01:51,060
It's so sad.

4246
03:01:51,780 --> 03:01:52,860
So disappointing.

4247
03:01:57,840 --> 03:01:59,000
But it was cute.

4248
03:01:59,260 --> 03:02:00,220
They were very cute.

4249
03:02:03,750 --> 03:02:05,990
I heard the ReZero collab was super rushed.

4250
03:02:06,230 --> 03:02:06,390
Really?

4251
03:02:12,730 --> 03:02:13,210
Interesting.

4252
03:02:13,670 --> 03:02:16,190
I don't know why it would be but...

4253
03:02:20,540 --> 03:02:21,680
Request of the rights holder.

4254
03:02:21,840 --> 03:02:22,680
I was thinking that too.

4255
03:02:23,700 --> 03:02:24,180
But...

4256
03:02:28,220 --> 03:02:30,400
I was thinking of that too but...

4257
03:02:30,940 --> 03:02:32,100
But it's Nikkei.

4258
03:02:32,320 --> 03:02:33,160
You... it's...

4259
03:02:33,160 --> 03:02:35,180
It's that kind of game, you know?

4260
03:02:35,700 --> 03:02:36,140
Like...

4261
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:40,460
I feel like it's really weird to be like...

4262
03:02:40,460 --> 03:02:41,540
Oh, by the way, don't...

4263
03:02:41,540 --> 03:02:45,320
Don't make them jiggle even though that's like the appeal of your game.

4264
03:02:45,500 --> 03:02:45,980
You know?

4265
03:02:46,440 --> 03:02:47,200
I don't know.

4266
03:02:47,900 --> 03:02:54,820
A few months ago, a Vtuber graduated and she mentioned she liked getting supers from fans talking of their achievements that motivated me to stick to gym.

4267
03:02:54,980 --> 03:02:59,420
I've lost 5 KGs since then because of her?

4268
03:02:59,760 --> 03:03:00,320
Let's go!

4269
03:03:01,060 --> 03:03:01,960
Oh my gosh!

4270
03:03:02,080 --> 03:03:02,480
Chosen!

4271
03:03:03,160 --> 03:03:04,140
That's so awesome!

4272
03:03:05,060 --> 03:03:06,340
What a coinky dink!

4273
03:03:06,420 --> 03:03:08,980
I also like hearing about your achievements.

4274
03:03:11,080 --> 03:03:12,020
Holy cow!

4275
03:03:13,700 --> 03:03:14,720
Big W!

4276
03:03:18,260 --> 03:03:19,320
Oh my gosh!

4277
03:03:23,100 --> 03:03:23,840
Let's go!

4278
03:03:27,480 --> 03:03:28,600
What's kilogram in American?

4279
03:03:28,900 --> 03:03:29,780
I don't know actually.

4280
03:03:30,600 --> 03:03:31,380
Let's see.

4281
03:03:35,100 --> 03:03:37,700
One kilogram is 2 pounds.

4282
03:03:38,900 --> 03:03:40,780
It's a little over 10 pounds.

4283
03:03:43,820 --> 03:03:45,380
It's a little over...

4284
03:03:47,600 --> 03:03:50,740
2.5 pounds to kilogram.

4285
03:03:52,540 --> 03:03:54,760
So yeah, 11 pounds.

4286
03:03:58,440 --> 03:04:01,400
How much is that in hamburgers?

4287
03:04:03,720 --> 03:04:04,560
Like...

4288
03:04:04,560 --> 03:04:05,420
Wait.

4289
03:04:08,540 --> 03:04:09,520
Hold on.

4290
03:04:09,720 --> 03:04:11,900
4 quarter pounders.

4291
03:04:15,990 --> 03:04:18,570
4 times 11.

4292
03:04:19,030 --> 03:04:19,870
44!

4293
03:04:21,010 --> 03:04:21,850
Burgers.

4294
03:04:28,880 --> 03:04:29,940
That's a lot of meat.

4295
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:32,440
That's a lot of meat.

4296
03:04:36,520 --> 03:04:38,180
I lost 44 burgers!

4297
03:04:38,780 --> 03:04:39,280
Yeah!

4298
03:04:40,940 --> 03:04:42,540
44 burgers!

4299
03:04:43,520 --> 03:04:44,800
I don't want a burger.

4300
03:04:46,660 --> 03:04:48,100
I don't want a burger.

4301
03:04:49,460 --> 03:04:50,240
I don't want a burger.

4302
03:04:52,020 --> 03:04:57,820
Go to items, gifts, donate gifts to gain star dust.

4303
03:04:58,040 --> 03:05:00,780
50 star dust buys one summon ticket from the shop.

4304
03:05:00,900 --> 03:05:03,360
I don't think I have enough items though, right?

4305
03:05:05,520 --> 03:05:06,000
Wait.

4306
03:05:07,560 --> 03:05:11,320
I also don't want to give away my gifts if I'm going to give them to...

4307
03:05:12,080 --> 03:05:14,960
If I want to level up Hoshino, right?

4308
03:05:20,830 --> 03:05:21,310
Oh!

4309
03:05:21,810 --> 03:05:22,610
I forgot...

4310
03:05:27,720 --> 03:05:28,920
I'm just using...

4311
03:05:28,920 --> 03:05:30,440
I'm just putting everything that I've gotten.

4312
03:05:33,930 --> 03:05:35,550
You probably have enough for one ticket.

4313
03:05:36,330 --> 03:05:37,150
For one...

4314
03:05:37,150 --> 03:05:38,270
One pull or...

4315
03:05:39,150 --> 03:05:39,630
Or...

4316
03:05:39,630 --> 03:05:40,150
10 pull.

4317
03:05:41,130 --> 03:05:41,950
Inume, please.

4318
03:05:42,170 --> 03:05:42,710
You said you're back.

4319
03:05:43,150 --> 03:05:44,270
Thank you for the five gifted.

4320
03:05:44,290 --> 03:05:44,750
Thank you!

4321
03:05:48,870 --> 03:05:49,710
One pull.

4322
03:05:49,810 --> 03:05:49,990
Yeah.

4323
03:05:50,090 --> 03:05:51,190
Oh, that's not worth it then.

4324
03:05:53,570 --> 03:05:54,850
That's not worth it.

4325
03:05:58,030 --> 03:06:01,330
You can get free stuff in the VIP tab since you bought jade.

4326
03:06:01,390 --> 03:06:01,790
Oh, really?

4327
03:06:02,450 --> 03:06:02,970
VIP.

4328
03:06:04,030 --> 03:06:04,930
Where is that?

4329
03:06:09,720 --> 03:06:10,240
Via...

4330
03:06:19,240 --> 03:06:20,000
Under event?

4331
03:06:26,180 --> 03:06:27,760
From the buy jade menu?

4332
03:06:30,320 --> 03:06:31,960
Yeah, I have to buy these too.

4333
03:06:32,240 --> 03:06:33,080
No way.

4334
03:06:34,820 --> 03:06:35,580
880.

4335
03:06:37,640 --> 03:06:38,860
Oh my gosh.

4336
03:06:39,180 --> 03:06:41,140
It's $15 per...

4337
03:06:41,820 --> 03:06:42,760
Per outfit?

4338
03:06:44,100 --> 03:06:45,200
It hurts.

4339
03:06:45,800 --> 03:06:47,180
It hurts so bad.

4340
03:06:54,270 --> 03:06:55,510
It hurts so bad.

4341
03:07:07,340 --> 03:07:09,440
Chance to change failures to success.

4342
03:07:11,380 --> 03:07:12,140
Yay.

4343
03:07:16,020 --> 03:07:18,180
I still don't see the VIP tag though.

4344
03:07:29,630 --> 03:07:31,010
We are number one.

4345
03:07:31,690 --> 03:07:32,210
We are number one.

4346
03:07:32,590 --> 03:07:33,510
I kind of...

4347
03:07:33,510 --> 03:07:34,110
I miss...

4348
03:07:34,110 --> 03:07:35,390
I really enjoy...

4349
03:07:35,390 --> 03:07:41,610
I miss that, like, time on the internet when everyone was just collectively making we are number one mashups.

4350
03:07:42,650 --> 03:07:44,650
Everybody unified for that song.

4351
03:07:45,030 --> 03:07:46,870
Everyone unified for that guy.

4352
03:07:47,090 --> 03:07:47,570
You know?

4353
03:07:47,850 --> 03:07:49,570
Jade buying menu VIP time.

4354
03:07:50,110 --> 03:07:51,070
Did I miss it?

4355
03:07:51,970 --> 03:07:53,410
Oh wait, this is just the shop.

4356
03:07:53,550 --> 03:07:53,970
So, okay.

4357
03:07:54,090 --> 03:07:55,030
So I have to go here.

4358
03:07:55,870 --> 03:07:57,110
Ah, here we go.

4359
03:07:57,130 --> 03:07:57,450
Here we go.

4360
03:07:58,170 --> 03:07:58,690
Clang.

4361
03:08:00,090 --> 03:08:01,850
I clang some things.

4362
03:08:03,670 --> 03:08:05,170
I don't know what these are though.

4363
03:08:11,280 --> 03:08:12,620
Yeah, Stephen Karl.

4364
03:08:13,340 --> 03:08:14,880
That guy was so awesome.

4365
03:08:15,900 --> 03:08:16,500
Yeah.

4366
03:08:16,920 --> 03:08:18,200
Ripped to a legend.

4367
03:08:18,320 --> 03:08:18,760
I know.

4368
03:08:18,940 --> 03:08:21,580
Everyone like came together because of him and...

4369
03:08:21,580 --> 03:08:22,520
Oh wait there's more.

4370
03:08:23,580 --> 03:08:24,180
Clang.

4371
03:08:25,160 --> 03:08:26,100
Successfully clang.

4372
03:08:26,840 --> 03:08:27,440
Clang.

4373
03:08:27,520 --> 03:08:27,940
Wow.

4374
03:08:28,940 --> 03:08:29,540
Clang.

4375
03:08:29,620 --> 03:08:30,000
Whoa.

4376
03:08:30,960 --> 03:08:31,560
Clang.

4377
03:08:31,640 --> 03:08:32,020
Whoa.

4378
03:08:32,180 --> 03:08:32,260
Clang.

4379
03:08:35,080 --> 03:08:35,600
Nice.

4380
03:08:37,100 --> 03:08:38,160
We got so much.

4381
03:08:41,140 --> 03:08:42,540
This is so cute.

4382
03:08:47,880 --> 03:08:50,820
He was also super cool about it and clearly loved all the memes too.

4383
03:08:51,300 --> 03:08:54,760
You can use that dust to buy gacha tickets.

4384
03:08:55,080 --> 03:08:55,880
What's the dust?

4385
03:09:00,070 --> 03:09:00,590
This?

4386
03:09:00,590 --> 03:09:02,490
No, these are... Oh, this dust.

4387
03:09:02,890 --> 03:09:03,550
Star dust.

4388
03:09:07,200 --> 03:09:10,160
Is there like a transfer?

4389
03:09:11,240 --> 03:09:14,440
Like a... Star dust to Jade?

4390
03:09:18,250 --> 03:09:20,030
100 star dust equals two rolls.

4391
03:09:20,190 --> 03:09:20,430
Really?

4392
03:09:21,330 --> 03:09:22,210
Go to the shop.

4393
03:09:22,410 --> 03:09:22,650
Okay.

4394
03:09:22,890 --> 03:09:23,630
Thank you guys.

4395
03:09:24,470 --> 03:09:25,410
Handholding for the win.

4396
03:09:28,190 --> 03:09:28,870
Handhold me.

4397
03:09:41,760 --> 03:09:42,680
Fortune tap.

4398
03:09:42,860 --> 03:09:43,140
Oh!

4399
03:09:46,140 --> 03:09:46,660
Oh!

4400
03:09:46,660 --> 03:09:47,480
Here we go.

4401
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:50,260
And I have... How many do I have?

4402
03:09:52,580 --> 03:09:53,840
What's a rename scroll?

4403
03:09:54,140 --> 03:09:56,200
You may change your nickname and... Oh.

4404
03:09:57,220 --> 03:09:57,740
What?

4405
03:09:59,040 --> 03:10:01,800
Why does it cost actual money to change my name?

4406
03:10:02,540 --> 03:10:03,060
What?

4407
03:10:07,520 --> 03:10:08,520
Oh, I have 100.

4408
03:10:09,040 --> 03:10:09,560
Okay.

4409
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:14,020
No way.

4410
03:10:14,680 --> 03:10:16,600
That's so expensive even.

4411
03:10:19,720 --> 03:10:20,200
I'm not a veteran of the game.

4412
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:20,800
Yo star, why?

4413
03:10:22,420 --> 03:10:23,380
I don't

4414
03:10:27,440 --> 03:10:27,900
have enough.

4415
03:10:28,080 --> 03:10:28,360
Okay.

4416
03:10:28,420 --> 03:10:29,440
Let's do this one then.

4417
03:10:29,900 --> 03:10:30,620
Why not?

4418
03:10:31,380 --> 03:10:32,480
What's this one do anyway?

4419
03:10:33,200 --> 03:10:34,780
One random green gift.

4420
03:10:38,360 --> 03:10:39,820
One random purple gift.

4421
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:40,420
Interesting.

4422
03:10:41,480 --> 03:10:42,360
You know what, whatever.

4423
03:10:42,540 --> 03:10:43,500
Well, I couldn't summon once.

4424
03:10:46,460 --> 03:10:46,940
Tap.

4425
03:10:51,570 --> 03:10:54,650
I think they gave one rename ticket out for free at some point.

4426
03:10:54,710 --> 03:10:55,270
That's crazy!

4427
03:10:55,410 --> 03:10:55,910
This is the only one?

4428
03:10:58,690 --> 03:11:00,270
Okay, re-summon.

4429
03:11:01,210 --> 03:11:02,290
This is the one.

4430
03:11:03,750 --> 03:11:04,310
Ooooooh...

4431
03:11:04,310 --> 03:11:04,910
Haaaaa!

4432
03:11:15,010 --> 03:11:15,570
Okay...

4433
03:11:18,490 --> 03:11:19,650
What if you...

4434
03:11:19,650 --> 03:11:20,910
What happens if you...

4435
03:11:20,910 --> 03:11:21,990
get a dupe?

4436
03:11:34,020 --> 03:11:35,720
You still have three single pulls.

4437
03:11:35,980 --> 03:11:38,140
I'm thinking I'm using them because...

4438
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:40,880
If I buy... let's see.

4439
03:11:48,800 --> 03:11:50,500
Wait, if I get... wait...

4440
03:11:50,500 --> 03:11:51,560
480...

4441
03:11:55,300 --> 03:11:57,600
This one would be close, right?

4442
03:11:58,180 --> 03:11:58,800
480...

4443
03:11:58,800 --> 03:12:02,340
The blue donut...

4444
03:12:10,470 --> 03:12:11,450
It's so...

4445
03:12:11,450 --> 03:12:13,150
It's a little off...

4446
03:12:13,150 --> 03:12:14,250
Yeah...

4447
03:12:15,290 --> 03:12:16,650
We'll just do the solo...

4448
03:12:18,590 --> 03:12:19,470
Let's do...

4449
03:12:20,140 --> 03:12:20,670
Let's do it.

4450
03:12:20,970 --> 03:12:21,970
We have a couple.

4451
03:12:24,790 --> 03:12:25,310
Nnnnnnnnnnnn...

4452
03:12:25,310 --> 03:12:25,470
Cha!

4453
03:12:30,570 --> 03:12:31,090
Girl...

4454
03:12:31,910 --> 03:12:32,430
Diamond...

4455
03:12:33,690 --> 03:12:34,710
One... two more.

4456
03:12:37,330 --> 03:12:37,850
Ooooooh...

4457
03:12:41,260 --> 03:12:41,780
Uuuh...

4458
03:12:43,120 --> 03:12:44,340
Really like the art style...

4459
03:12:44,340 --> 03:12:45,820
Blue archive in Mahjong Soul.

4460
03:12:46,080 --> 03:12:47,020
But I think I'll pass.

4461
03:12:47,180 --> 03:12:48,460
Trying to rehabilitate from gacha.

4462
03:12:48,620 --> 03:12:49,800
Only blue archive currently.

4463
03:12:51,160 --> 03:12:52,960
That's basically me, Hyrule.

4464
03:12:53,160 --> 03:12:55,460
I only have one gacha that I actually...

4465
03:12:57,340 --> 03:12:57,860
Like...

4466
03:12:58,180 --> 03:12:58,500
Try...

4467
03:13:02,160 --> 03:13:03,620
Even in this game...

4468
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:06,260
Even in this game...

4469
03:13:06,260 --> 03:13:06,440
Even in this game...

4470
03:13:06,440 --> 03:13:07,180
Like the gacha...

4471
03:13:07,680 --> 03:13:08,120
Feels...

4472
03:13:08,120 --> 03:13:10,340
Maybe it's more expensive because like...

4473
03:13:11,720 --> 03:13:14,020
In this, you really don't have to do the gacha.

4474
03:13:14,440 --> 03:13:15,400
You know what I mean?

4475
03:13:15,800 --> 03:13:17,720
Like in other games, you get gacha...

4476
03:13:17,720 --> 03:13:19,940
You get other characters for like special abilities.

4477
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:21,500
But in this game, it's like...

4478
03:13:21,500 --> 03:13:22,420
Just cosmetic.

4479
03:13:22,820 --> 03:13:25,260
So maybe that's why it's kind of more expensive, right?

4480
03:13:26,200 --> 03:13:27,780
I want to head pat Hoshino.

4481
03:13:30,060 --> 03:13:30,580
So...

4482
03:13:30,580 --> 03:13:32,580
I kind of understand it.

4483
03:13:32,620 --> 03:13:34,060
Like in other games, it's like...

4484
03:13:34,060 --> 03:13:34,480
You know...

4485
03:13:34,480 --> 03:13:36,840
You get characters to get...

4486
03:13:36,840 --> 03:13:39,900
To do better damage and do stuff like that.

4487
03:13:41,320 --> 03:13:41,840
But...

4488
03:13:41,840 --> 03:13:43,380
Here it is just Mahjong.

4489
03:13:43,480 --> 03:13:46,020
You can totally play without paying anything.

4490
03:13:46,660 --> 03:13:47,180
So...

4491
03:13:47,180 --> 03:13:49,880
I mean, not to say that you have to pay for other...

4492
03:13:49,880 --> 03:13:51,820
Like you know, other gacha games too.

4493
03:13:51,960 --> 03:13:52,340
But...

4494
03:13:53,100 --> 03:13:54,220
I get it, I get it.

4495
03:13:54,740 --> 03:13:55,560
A little bit.

4496
03:14:02,830 --> 03:14:03,310
Okay.

4497
03:14:04,410 --> 03:14:06,650
There's one really funny thing about Hoshino.

4498
03:14:07,510 --> 03:14:08,930
It is her recollection.

4499
03:14:08,930 --> 03:14:11,210
If you look up Hoshino's recollection...

4500
03:14:12,450 --> 03:14:12,930
Charlie!

4501
03:14:13,590 --> 03:14:14,770
Thank you for the five gifted.

4502
03:14:14,870 --> 03:14:15,490
Thank you!

4503
03:14:15,550 --> 03:14:16,570
Thank you so much!

4504
03:14:17,430 --> 03:14:19,190
If you look up Hoshino's recollection...

4505
03:14:19,490 --> 03:14:20,770
In Blue Archive...

4506
03:14:20,770 --> 03:14:21,710
Oh my god.

4507
03:14:21,750 --> 03:14:22,850
Her face...

4508
03:14:23,790 --> 03:14:24,750
Is so...

4509
03:14:24,750 --> 03:14:25,450
Dumb.

4510
03:14:25,450 --> 03:14:26,410
It's so...

4511
03:14:28,610 --> 03:14:30,010
It's so silly.

4512
03:14:30,290 --> 03:14:31,310
She goes to...

4513
03:14:31,310 --> 03:14:33,650
She goes to the aquarium.

4514
03:14:34,350 --> 03:14:35,490
And like...

4515
03:14:35,490 --> 03:14:39,090
It's the live 2D where her eyes are just like...

4516
03:14:39,090 --> 03:14:40,410
Bugging out of her head.

4517
03:14:40,510 --> 03:14:41,710
And she goes like...

4518
03:14:42,750 --> 03:14:44,930
Her eyes are literally like...

4519
03:14:44,930 --> 03:14:45,770
Bugging out.

4520
03:14:45,910 --> 03:14:46,890
It's so funny.

4521
03:14:47,730 --> 03:14:49,410
Let me see if I can find a picture.

4522
03:14:51,170 --> 03:14:51,950
Let's see.

4523
03:14:53,390 --> 03:14:54,030
Hoshi...

4524
03:14:56,070 --> 03:14:56,590
Recollection.

4525
03:15:04,580 --> 03:15:05,620
Oh no.

4526
03:15:05,720 --> 03:15:07,180
There's none that shows her...

4527
03:15:07,180 --> 03:15:07,740
Buggy eyes.

4528
03:15:09,060 --> 03:15:09,580
Boo!

4529
03:15:09,680 --> 03:15:10,180
I'm back.

4530
03:15:10,360 --> 03:15:10,900
Welcome back!

4531
03:15:14,220 --> 03:15:15,540
This is for you!

4532
03:15:19,360 --> 03:15:21,040
Hmm... I wonder if there's like...

4533
03:15:21,040 --> 03:15:21,820
A gif of it.

4534
03:15:26,960 --> 03:15:27,480
No.

4535
03:15:27,580 --> 03:15:28,940
It's just her standing there.

4536
03:15:30,680 --> 03:15:31,760
I need the movement.

4537
03:15:32,020 --> 03:15:32,700
I need the...

4538
03:15:33,400 --> 03:15:37,060
There are videos on YouTube?

4539
03:15:37,600 --> 03:15:38,100
Yeah.

4540
03:15:38,620 --> 03:15:40,800
Let me turn off the audio real quick.

4541
03:15:40,860 --> 03:15:41,640
Because I don't want it to play.

4542
03:15:42,360 --> 03:15:44,740
I don't want to get copyright...

4543
03:15:44,740 --> 03:15:46,220
Struck by anybody.

4544
03:15:47,240 --> 03:15:47,900
Let's see.

4545
03:15:49,440 --> 03:15:49,960
Okay.

4546
03:15:50,160 --> 03:15:50,900
There we go.

4547
03:15:56,520 --> 03:15:58,080
Head pat Hoshi.

4548
03:15:58,980 --> 03:16:00,260
Head pat Hoshi.

4549
03:16:01,660 --> 03:16:03,220
Where does she do the...

4550
03:16:03,220 --> 03:16:03,720
Oh there it is.

4551
03:16:10,680 --> 03:16:11,960
Oh my god!

4552
03:16:12,260 --> 03:16:13,600
So funny.

4553
03:16:22,570 --> 03:16:22,980
Ooooooooh...

4554
03:16:30,290 --> 03:16:31,110
Ooooooooooooh...

4555
03:16:31,110 --> 03:16:31,230
Ooooooooh...

4556
03:16:38,210 --> 03:16:41,490
It's the movement too, with it, it's just her eyes...

4557
03:16:41,490 --> 03:16:42,110
Her Buggy...

4558
03:16:46,760 --> 03:16:47,170
Ooooooooooooh...

4559
03:16:49,400 --> 03:16:50,220
Ooooooooh...

4560
03:16:51,380 --> 03:16:52,200
Oooooooooh...

4561
03:16:52,200 --> 03:16:53,320
Ooooooooooooh...

4562
03:17:05,380 --> 03:17:06,440
It's so funny.

4563
03:17:07,820 --> 03:17:09,700
I like saying it every time.

4564
03:17:09,740 --> 03:17:10,900
It makes me laugh every time.

4565
03:17:28,120 --> 03:17:30,540
Some of you have been asking for W3.

4566
03:17:40,740 --> 03:17:42,400
Oh my God!

4567
03:17:42,940 --> 03:17:43,840
It's like...

4568
03:17:43,840 --> 03:17:44,540
Oh God!

4569
03:17:44,620 --> 03:17:45,220
It's so scary!

4570
03:17:45,220 --> 03:17:46,900
Every time I blink...

4571
03:17:58,540 --> 03:17:59,500
There we go.

4572
03:18:00,060 --> 03:18:01,560
It's just a little bit wobbly.

4573
03:18:10,040 --> 03:18:12,640
Thank you guys again for teaching me how to play Mahjong.

4574
03:18:12,700 --> 03:18:13,580
A little bit at least.

4575
03:18:14,120 --> 03:18:15,780
I will keep practicing.

4576
03:18:15,980 --> 03:18:17,660
I will keep playing.

4577
03:18:19,740 --> 03:18:22,500
One day I would like to do some sort of tournament.

4578
03:18:22,700 --> 03:18:23,000
I don't know.

4579
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:24,180
Maybe it's a lot of pressure though.

4580
03:18:24,420 --> 03:18:25,740
Maybe I'll just play for fun.

4581
03:18:25,780 --> 03:18:26,100
Who knows?

4582
03:18:27,940 --> 03:18:27,940
I don't know.

4583
03:18:27,940 --> 03:18:31,280
Maybe I'll just play for fun.

4584
03:18:31,420 --> 03:18:31,980
I just wait.

4585
03:18:32,660 --> 03:18:33,220
Uwaaa...

4586
03:18:36,080 --> 03:18:37,280
Good evening everybody!

4587
03:18:37,860 --> 03:18:39,060
I'm gonna go...

4588
03:18:40,640 --> 03:18:43,380
And let my brain rest for a little while.

4589
03:18:46,700 --> 03:18:48,240
Sensei, it's so hot out here!

4590
03:18:50,580 --> 03:18:51,140
Thank

4591
03:18:55,290 --> 03:18:55,950
you so much!

4592
03:18:56,230 --> 03:18:56,890
Thank you!

4593
03:18:57,050 --> 03:18:57,210
Thank you!

4594
03:18:57,230 --> 03:18:57,610
Thank you!

4595
03:18:57,710 --> 03:18:58,410
It was you guys!

4596
03:19:00,210 --> 03:19:03,610
See you tomorrow for our tour of Akihabara!

4597
03:19:05,530 --> 03:19:06,450
I'm so excited.

4598
03:19:06,570 --> 03:19:08,090
I'm so excited to go around Akihabara.

4599
03:19:08,610 --> 03:19:11,170
Thank you for the stream.

4600
03:19:11,350 --> 03:19:11,830
Later man.

4601
03:19:11,910 --> 03:19:12,550
Thank you guys.

4602
03:19:12,770 --> 03:19:13,070
Thank you.

4603
03:19:13,190 --> 03:19:13,470
Thank you.

4604
03:19:13,830 --> 03:19:14,850
Thank you.

4605
03:19:15,030 --> 03:19:15,870
Thank you.

4606
03:19:16,270 --> 03:19:16,750
Thank you.

4607
03:19:17,070 --> 03:19:18,070
Bye bye.

4608
03:19:18,270 --> 03:19:18,810
Bye bye.

4609
03:19:19,210 --> 03:19:20,030
See you later.

4610
03:19:20,470 --> 03:19:21,270
See you.

4611
03:19:21,350 --> 03:19:22,210
Thank you guys.

4612
03:19:22,470 --> 03:19:23,170
Bye bye.

4613
03:19:51,240 --> 03:19:53,380
I saved my notes so I have them.

4614
03:19:53,900 --> 03:19:55,380
I saved my notes.

4615
03:19:55,840 --> 03:19:57,940
So I will be prepared.

4616
03:19:58,880 --> 03:20:00,300
I will study the blade.

4617
03:20:00,600 --> 03:20:01,640
I will study the tie.

4618
03:20:02,520 --> 03:20:03,440
I am ready.

4619
03:20:07,940 --> 03:20:09,840
Look at me kicking my little feet.

4620
03:20:10,520 --> 03:20:11,440
This is so cute.

4621
03:20:12,440 --> 03:20:13,980
I should get an updated one.

4622
03:20:14,140 --> 03:20:17,420
Like of my new outfit.

4623
03:20:18,280 --> 03:20:19,440
My current outfit.

4624
03:20:19,640 --> 03:20:20,500
The outfit I've been using.

4625
03:20:20,780 --> 03:20:21,220
Have a good night.

4626
03:20:21,240 --> 03:20:21,760
Thank you for the stream.

4627
03:20:21,900 --> 03:20:22,480
Thank you.

4628
03:20:24,100 --> 03:20:24,540
What

4629
03:20:28,400 --> 03:20:29,760
is the name for simpler times?

4630
03:20:32,740 --> 03:20:33,840
Times that are simple.

4631
03:20:36,120 --> 03:20:36,600
Stimes.

4632
03:20:39,480 --> 03:20:41,580
Are they kicking his adorbs?

4633
03:20:43,720 --> 03:20:44,200
Yeah.

4634
03:20:44,600 --> 03:20:46,120
I like this one a lot though.

4635
03:20:46,600 --> 03:20:50,540
I don't know if this artist... this was actually like a your character here thing.
