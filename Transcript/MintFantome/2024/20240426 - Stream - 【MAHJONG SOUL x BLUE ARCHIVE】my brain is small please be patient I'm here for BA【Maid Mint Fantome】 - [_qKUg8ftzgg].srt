00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,610
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,660
I think the chat is a little delayed.

3
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,960
But turtles, thank you for the akasuba.

4
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:45,940
Thank you.

5
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,140
Thank you.

6
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,760
I said in the chat, I was like, no!

7
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,120
No, akasuba, no!

8
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:07,320
If you notice something different about me, I am not an
angel when I have a halo.

9
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,740
I have Shiroko.

10
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,600
Look at her.

11
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,780
She's voiced by Ogura Yui Maiseu Oshi.

12
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,340
I'm here for Blue Archive.

13
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,440
I'm here.

14
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,140
Where are the horns?

15
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:29,980
Is she not cool?

16
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
It doesn't have horns?

17
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,220
Who?

18
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,540
Okay, there's actually a lot of characters that have horns
in Blue Archive.

19
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,080
Oh gosh.

20
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,740
This is going to turn into a stream about me wanting to talk
about Blue Archive, I think,

21
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,440
than playing Majang, maybe.

22
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,240
I'm actually quite nervous because...

23
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,340
I was like, oh my god.

24
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,380
I'm so nervous.

25
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,320
What if I just like, I don't know, because I get really
embarrassed about like, I don't know.

26
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:06,880
I don't know.

27
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,940
I just get embarrassed.

28
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,080
I was like, it's like learning something like this.

29
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,500
What if I don't get it and people think I'm so dumb?

30
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,880
Because this is actually not my first time trying to learn
Majong.

31
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:27,600
I've tried to learn before in the past, but I, um, I, I, I
just didn't get it at all.

32
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,340
It's okay, we already think that.

33
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,080
Yippee!

34
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,860
It's okay if you don't, plenty of streamers don't.

35
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,800
Okay, will you guys help me?

36
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,640
Will you guys help me?

37
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,220
It takes a bit before it clicks.

38
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,760
I've had friends try to teach me.

39
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,880
I've tried to learn through Majang Soul.

40
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,440
I've tried learning from...

41
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,580
Maybe I'm not like applying myself as much as I should, you
know.

42
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:10,980
of like maybe i'm just kind of like whatever just click
click block set block something happen i don't know i know

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:28,780

girls oh my gosh they're so cute Right?

45
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,240
That's Shiroko.

46
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,500
She's so cute.

47
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,820
I love... She's kind of like Kudere, but she's also like
silly.

48
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,640
Which is what I really like about her.

49
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,980
Because she's got like a cool personality.

50
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,100
Thank you!

51
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,460
Gotcha puns.

52
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,260
No, gotcha puns.

53
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,200
Um...

54
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,720
As a Majan player, anyone who tells you they know how to
play is lying.

55
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,960
That makes me feel a little better.

56
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,020
Yeah, Shiroko is goofy as hell.

57
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,240
She's so goofy.

58
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:08,860

That's so funny.

65
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,580
I learned from Saki, so this should be fine.

66
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:08,800
I didn't finish Saki, but what I learned from Saki is that
panties are overrated.

67
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,120
Nobody in that show wears them.

68
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,380
I mean, asking anyone for a booty call.

69
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,360
It's a boo, get it?

70
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,080
Boo, booty call.

71
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,500

72
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,120
This is Aru right here.

73
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,780
She looks very cool and very lovely.

74
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:35,380
like mysterious and not mysterious maybe like mature mature
another m word that i was saying she looks very mature and

75
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:46,260
very cool but she's actually also kind of a girl failure
this is hoshino she's the oji san um with a tragic past and

76
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:56,180
this is muzuki and she's just a little brat she's so cute

78
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:21,620
cute Very very cute Sal I don't There's Oh I was gonna say
there's not a single character in Blue Archive that I

79
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:30,820
dislike But I don't think that's true actually Um There's
one girl in Blue Archive who, her voice, like, she's very

80
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,660
cute, but her voice just grates on me so bad.

81
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,560
So bad.

82
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,600
Oji, sound very cute.

83
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:41,900
Bashamine!

84
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,900
She's a girl!

85
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,160
How did you guys know?

86
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,060
Wait, is it not just me?

87
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,660
Oh my gosh.

88
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,560
No way.

89
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,280
No way!

90
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,620
Is it not just me?

91
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,080
I feel really validated right now.

92
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,160
Oh my gosh, I feel...

93
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,720
During the event, there was an event recently in Blue
Archive where like, they did like, what's the word?

94
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,620
What's the word?

95
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,640
Like a bathing suit.

96
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,020
They were like, it was a summer event.

97
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,260
They were on like bathing suits and stuff.

98
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,740
And I could barely touch the event because Shizuko was so...

99
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,220
Oh my gosh.

100
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,400
I would click the page and she would talk and I'd be like,
Ah!

101
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,560
Oh!

102
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,220
I'm like covering my ear.

103
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:35,480
I'm like, Oh, no, I feel so bad saying that because I'm sure
her Sayu is like super cute and super nice and everything.

104
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,560
She's just doing her best.

105
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,620
Oh, gosh.

106
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,620
And she's going so cute herself, you know?

107
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,020
Didn't know Blue Archive got a new student.

108
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,540
Who's the cute one on the bottom left?

109
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,660
Can we pull her yet?

110
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,200
Will her headpats, we'll give her headpats in the memorial
lobby.

111
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,060
Mutsuki?

112
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,740
Wait, can you see?

113
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,360
Okay, good.

114
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,860
I was making sure you could...

115
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,100
Okay.

116
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,300
Her voice is the best part.

117
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,840
It's definitely a charm point, I'm sure, for some.

118
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,660
But that event specifically made me be like, oh gosh.

119
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,860
Oh gosh.

120
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,880
Literally one of my favorite aspects about Shizuko is her
voice.

121
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,800
That's okay.

122
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,300
Like I said, it is a charm point for some people.

123
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,200
You know?

124
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,500
It's a charm.

125
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,880
And I like her recollection very much.

126
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,500
It's very cute.

127
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,460
She is really cute.

128
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,980
She's very cute.

129
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,800
Why are you upset?

130
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,840
Why are you upset, Jun?

131
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,220
Is it because I said she's a goban?

132
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,020
I didn't say she's a goban.

133
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,840
I didn't say it, though.

134
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,520
But as for my favorite Blue Archive characters, I really
like...

135
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,080
Hold on, let me just pull up my...

136
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,200
I've had to do this the other day, too.

137
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,240
Let's see.

138
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,860
Actually, did I do my daily stuff?

139
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,140
I don't know if I played before the before the reset or not

140
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,220
Time to do them now.

141
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,700
We will play mahjong Sorry, everybody.

142
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:29,900
I'm too busy talking about blue archive It's the only reason
I'm here So I play I play um, I don't play the Japanese blue

143
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,280

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,680

There's a battle in progress?

148
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,300

but Koharu and Cherino are like two of my top favorites.

162
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,780
I love Chenino a lot.

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,060
She's so dumb.

164
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,260
She's just so stupid.

165
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,780
I really love Toki.

166
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,640
I do like Hoshi no a lot too.

167
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,100
Of course I love Shiroko.

I want to try.

169
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,300
Actually, I do like Mutsuki, but she's like not one of my
top tops.

go there i have to i have to get that so because I wasn't

173
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:44,460
familiar with the artist but I went to Ayami's booth and
then I went to someone else maybe it was Pan Pan no Mimi or

174
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:55,960
Kaori but they were very close they were very close who's
the artist do you guys mind if I get the dojin?

175
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:57,840
Hold on.

176
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,280
Let me double check.

177
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,020
I should follow them.

178
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,040
Hold on.

179
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,180
I'm going to turn this down.

180
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,940
The music doesn't loop as like the music needs to be a
little bit longer.

181
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,700
Okay, hold on.

182
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,640
Let me get the dojin.

183
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,840
I'm really glad I knew where it was because I went through
some of my I went through some of my books recently.

184
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,440
So I was, I knew, I knew where it was.

185
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,920
Shino Kitsune.

186
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,800
Shiro Kitsune is the artist at Shiro-ro Kitsune.

187
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,100
So at Shiro-ro Kitsune.

188
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,920
So instead, their name is Shiro Kitsune, but their ad is at
Shiro-ro Kitsune.

189
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,720
And if you see the daki, it's so...

190
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,520
It's actually maybe...

191
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,980
It's actually maybe the softest daki makura I've ever owned.

192
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,180
Type it in the Chapman?

193
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,220
Oh, yeah, I can do that.

194
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,000
Give me one second.

195
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,040
At...

196
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,240
There you go.

197
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,140
It's probably the softest daki makura I've ever owned.

198
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,120
And Toki is just so...

199
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,880
She's so cute and so sexy on one side.

200
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,160
One side is her...

201
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,400
Is this playable on PC?

202
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,320
Yeah, I'm playing it on PC right now.

203
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,720
It's also, you can play it on browser too.

204
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,400
One side is Mei Toki and the other side, the lewd side is
Bunny Toki.

205
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,200
It's so, wait, did I get that right?

206
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,420
I think so.

207
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,600
Or maybe they were both lewd sides.

208
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,320
Akane is best girl of all time.

209
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,300
Akane is side boob city, baby.

210
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:09,750
Yeah.

211
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,180
So, I checked in both lude sides.

212
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,560
Whoopsie.

213
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,200
But it's really cute, right?

214
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,560
It's like, it's, and if you can find it, it's so soft.

215
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,180
It's so soft.

216
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,580
Yeah.

217
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,960
Oh, Akko!

218
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,180
Sorry, I was thinking of Akko.

219
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:33,840
You're so right.

220
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,700
I was thinking of Akko.

221
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,860
Naraka name.

222
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,520
Asana got me into the game, but stayed for Hina.

223
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,620
Hina's a good girl.

224
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:50,060
Oh my gosh, when I was in Japan, they had a Blue Archive
Valentine's event at the Akiba and Atore.

225
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,320
And they had, they had Hina's little floaty.

226
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,100
They had her floaty that she has in her bathing suit.

227
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,680
Not uniform.

228
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,440
Outfit.

229
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,840

Majang has 34 different tiles.

255
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,850
They can be sorted into five groups.

256
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,050
Man, Pin, So, Wind, and Dragon.

257
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:00,870

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,240
She's so cute!

274
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,400
Sequence?

275
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,720
Three consecutive number tiles.

276
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,580

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,540
Oh, yeah, if you can't read it, it could be confusing,
right?

283
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:01,760
Wait.

284
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,600
Okay, I just realized the sequence has to be like 6, 7, 8,
right?

285
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,760
It can't be like 4, 8, 9 or something, right?

286
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,280
Like, it has to be like 3 consecutive consecutive.

Putting on my glasses for this so I can really learn.

295
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:45,880
But...

296
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,120

00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,380
I'm so bad.

317
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,240
There's so many girls.

318
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,020
I'm really bad at remembering a bunch of names.

319
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:34,520
so if you say somebody and i'm like who it's because i'm bad
with the names in blue archive okay four sequences okay wait

320
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:48,280
okay so four sequences or triplets plus one pair equals
winning winning winning okay so pair is too identical or a

321
00:23:48,280 --> 00:24:05,740
triplet four sequences or triplets plus one pair equals
winning winning winning this game is like poker but tiles

322
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:16,540
instead of cards you know what I never could understand
poker either so nerd says you with your silly ducky hoodie

323
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:29,680
would it come on the main objective of majeung is complete a
winning hand it's it means the player has to achieve a hand

324
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:38,780
consisting of four sequences slash triplets plus one pair to
reach that goal each turn you draw one tile from the tile

325
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:47,100
wall and if it's not the winning tile you choose one tile to
discard and maintain me main maintain a hand consisting of

326
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,140
13 tiles step by step you will get closer to a winning hand
okay

327
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,720
Who's hand with that?

328
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,240
Oh my god.

329
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,100
Here, let's discard the west tile that's unneeded here.

330
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,440
Yeah, we don't need this one.

331
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,840
That's my hand.

332
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,700
Okay, in addition to the tile group requirement to win, the
winning hand must also contain at least one yak.

333
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,500
What's a yak?

334
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,300
Simple yak.

335
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:26,720
Wait.

336
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:28,740

00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,600
No, Yaku.

341
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,960
Yaku equals win conditions.

342
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,600
It's a valid hand.

343
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,100
Of course it is.

344
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,800
So, I want to introduce a really popular and easily
achievable Yaku.

345
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,020
All simples.

346
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,220
Also called...

347
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:11,100
Tanyao, if your hand only has number tiles with numbers from
2 to 8, in other words, does not have honor tiles, wind or

348
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:19,180
dragon tiles, or terminal tiles, number tiles with one or
nine, then it meets the requirements for all symbols.

349
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,120
So let's try it out.

350
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,560
Okay, so no ones or nines.

351
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,520
Okay, hold on.

352
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,080
Yaku, no one or nine, no wind.

353
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,200
No dragon.

354
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,740
What's this one?

355
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,780
Why is it just blank?

356
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:37,880
It's like, who?

357
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,100
Who is this?

358
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:39,680
Who?

359
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,100
Okay.

360
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,500
So just anything else?

361
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,840
Just say 2 through 8.

362
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,600
Yeah, yeah.

363
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,680
2 through 8.

364
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:49,960
Good.

365
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,620
2 through 8.

366
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,840
What's 4 doing all the way over here?

367
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,740
Hmm.

368
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,520
Oh, white dragon.

369
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,210
I don't know.

370
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,010
We already have one triplet.

371
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:22,930
Yes, right here.

372
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,230
This is our triplet.

373
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,530
The twos.

374
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,930
Sorry, I'm blocking a little bit of it.

375
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,870
Two sequence.

376
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,210
Six, seven, eight.

377
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:33,790
Here.

378
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,270
And one pair.

379
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:46,170
wait what's the pair two identical time tiles here here's
our tip here's our pair here's our pair here's our pair so

380
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:54,090
once we have completed the last sequence we have a winning
hand and it meets the requirement for all symbols get rid of

381
00:27:54,090 --> 00:28:03,030
you when your hand is waiting for the winning tile like this
you are in ten pie if you have yaku and are in ten pie you

382
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:10,690
just need someone to discard the last needed tile or draw it
yourself to win wait why discard the last needed tile am i

383
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:26,020
allowed to take their tiles yeah we have double here so we
need us so we have triplet one sequence uh two sequence oh

384
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:41,100
wait wait wait i have a question if it's so is it four Okay,
if I have two sequences and two triplets, is that okay?

385
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,000
Come on, Zhang is easy.

386
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,600
Don't worry about it.

387
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,040
Yeah.

388
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,580
Yes, that's okay.

389
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,180
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

390
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,720
Yes, plus the pair.

391
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,480
Ah, so it says four sets in total.

392
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,140
Okay, let me write that.

393
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,120
In, in total.

394
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,900
So four, so, okay.

395
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,820
So we have a one triplet.

396
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,660
One sequence.

397
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,540
One, two sequences.

398
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,560
So we need...

399
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,520
And then a pair.

400
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,520
So we need either a three or we need six.

401
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,320
Okay.

402
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:25,920
Okay.

403
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,840
So that'll make three sequences.

404
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,700
And then one triplet, which is four in total.

405
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,600
Oh my gosh, I can do math!

406
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:41,360
I'm adding addition, subtraction, multiplication.

407
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,580
Give me, okay, that's the title we need.

408
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,340
That one right there, we can win now.

409
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,520
Tap the wrong button.

410
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,400
None.

411
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,020
None.

412
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:08,880
This is going to take my brain into overdrive.

413
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,500
Holy cow.

414
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,580
Congratulations on the win, yeah!

415
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,920
This is the end of today's practice session.

416
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,060
You can review the tutorial by chapter or just check out the
revision.

417
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,760
Yippee!

418
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,260
Give me the coins.

419
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,480
The copper.

420
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,380
Is that how we do the gotcha?

421
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,020
Hold on, I kind of want to check.

422
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,680
How do we do the gotcha?

423
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,420
Why not take a breather and check out a festival at another
school?

424
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,950
Oh, following the research, recent upheaval at Abido's high
school.

425
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:58,190
Shiroko and Hoshino followed Sensei's advice and took a bus
to Allied Hyakkiyako Academy for their festival.

426
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,650
Or at least that's what they thought they were doing.

427
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,170
Gacha needs premium currency.

428
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,250
No!

429
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,730
Oh my gosh.

430
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:14,190
This doesn't look like Allied Hyakkiyako Academy.

431
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,030
Wait, there's a whole story even?

432
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,430
Shiroko stared at the school in front of her with a blank
expression.

433
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,290
Next to her, Hoshino yawned unconcernedly.

434
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,230
Clearly, we're in the wrong place.

435
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,690
Look, the pillar over there says this is Asaha High School.

436
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,270
Is it Allied?

437
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,330
Allied?

438
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,350
And it was shaping up to be such a nice day.

439
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,370
Even you dozed off for a bit, Shiroko.

440
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,710
I thought we were at Allied.

441
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,170
Allied Hyakiyako Academy.

442
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,310
I'm sorry, I should have paid more attention to the name of
the stop.

443
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,550
I'll go see when the next bus arrives.

444
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,150
Give me the gacha.

445
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,150
We went to go to a school festival.

446
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,990
Here is just as good as anywhere.

447
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,930
Why are Abido students at Neo Japan High?

448
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,650
Looks like they're having a festival too.

449
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,370
Why don't we go in and have a little fun?

450
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,950
Look, she must have been late for school.

451
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,770
She's got her toast in her mouth and everything.

452
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,710
If you're sure, then I guess it would be okay.

453
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,450
I'm sure.

454
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:22,690
Shall we?

455
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,890
What a coincidence.

456
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,190
Oh!

457
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,270
The problem solvers are here.

458
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,830
They're so cute.

459
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,750
Look at them!

460
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,190
Oh, Shiroko is so cute.

461
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,810
There was the blue archive, like, um, what's the word?

462
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:57,470
The blue archive of, like, anniversary festival thing and
they sold her scarf and her and her ears and her little hair

463
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,170
pin and i bought all of it

464
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,890
just as hoshino and shiroko approached the gates they heard
a voice call out from behind them and turned to see two

465
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:20,170
familiar figures president niko hachimaru and asagimutsuki
members of infamous problem solver 68 known as the outlaws

466
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:26,170
of kivotos their four member team is so close-knit that
they've been known to happily split a bowl of ramen between

467
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:32,850
them they are the inheritors of the masked swimsuit gang's
legacy and build themselves as reliable and trustworthy oh

468
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:43,650
sorry reliable and trustworthy when it comes to fulfilling
some rather dubious contracts good morning friends of

469
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,790
abido's high school

470
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,530
Who are you also summoned here?

471
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:52,770
Summoned?

472
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:53,650
Lord dump.

473
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,170
Yeah, split the ramen bowls for bonding.

474
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,050
No other reason.

475
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:58,570
No.

476
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,890
No, it's not like...

477
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,190
Oh my gosh, look at the tummy detail on Aru.

478
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,590
Just a rumor I heard.

479
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,430
It's nothing.

480
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,970
Did Asaha High School hire you?

481
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,770
Yeah, we got a last minute call yesterday.

482
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,170
Tough job.

483
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,210
Nothing problem-solver 68 can't handle.

484
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,450
We never leave loose ends.

485
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,030
Kuku.

486
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,230
Hmm, how very professional of you.

487
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,570
I make us look so good.

488
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:34,950
Aru.

489
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,650
She looks so cute.

490
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:39,850
Oh my gosh.

491
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,230
They look so good.

492
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,490
Aru prefers big jobs.

493
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,850
But actually, things have been pretty slow.

494
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,190
lately.

495
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,450
We don't have the luxury of being choosy about contracts
right now.

496
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,510
Mutsuki's naughty face, I know.

497
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,770
Ugh.

498
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,870
Are you two just here to hang out?

499
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,470
Yes.

500
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:04,750
Sensei suggested we should take some time to relax and check
out another school's festival.

501
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,950
Oh, that sounds nice.

502
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:09,850
Ahem!

503
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,990
It's getting late, Mutsuki, and we shouldn't keep our client
waiting.

504
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,150
It's bad business.

505
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,410
If you'll excuse us.

506
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:21,090
Aru flashed a perfunctory...

507
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,070
Sm...

508
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,250
Smile.

509
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,490
And set off towards the school.

510
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,310
Muskiy waved goodbye to Hoshino and Shiroko and followed.

511
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,050
Perfunctory.

512
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,160
I don't know much about...

513
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,340
Much of Blue Archive, but I think I've seen that blue cat at
the bank before.

514
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,020
How could you tell from her disguise?

515
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,260
Humph.

516
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,760
Happy Bunchard Day.

517
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,440
Shall we head in too?

518
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,600
Sure.

519
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:08,200
So the foreclosure task force and problem solver 68 join the
festivities inside Asaha High School.

520
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,160
Oh!

521
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,600
Goshini-sama, Asaha High School is holding a school festival
with lots of fun activities and delicious food, yeah!

522
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,120
Oh my gosh, it's a bomb!

523
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:32,730
But they are short on men power, so they ask if Master can
help out with approving proposals, Nya!

524
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:38,490
Ichi and Hime has already said yes and ate the pudding, so
Master can't say no, Nya.

525
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,590
We are number one!

526
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,070
I hear it.

527
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,430
I'm definitely gonna be able to un-hear it.

528
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:54,870
Nya, Nya!

529
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,150
We already got a proposal here!

530
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,010
Master, let's tap on this proposal and check out the
content, Nya!

531
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:10,410
I propose we forbid Ichihime from take to take part in the
festival she already has cleared the stock of the snacks

532
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:20,770
then at the school gate strongly agree master don't take
this prank seriously yeah anyway when you approve a proposal

533
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,990
the three fest stats will change now there's

534
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,100
mashups of the two I can believe it

535
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,240
When the first stats meet the rank-up requirement, the first
rank will go up.

536
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,060
The current rank is E-minus, so we still have a long way to
go.

537
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,720
But I'm sure Master can do it, Nya.

538
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,160
The good news is that Master won't be working alone, Nya.

539
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,020
A few special guests have arrived at the festival, and they
will help you out, Nya.

540
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,540
Let's go meet them now.

541
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,340
Nya,

542
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,340
hold on.

543
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,640
How do I pull them?

544
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,860
How do I get them?

545
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,260
Tutorial.

546
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,880
During the festival, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

547
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,060
Level up, level up.

548
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,420
Confirm.

549
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,650
To the shop?

550
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,450
Where do I pull them at?

551
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,350
Oh, shop.

552
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,610
Wait, they have...

553
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,590
Did they have their own outfits?

554
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,250
Whoa!

555
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:50,810
Whoa!

556
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,190
She, she, she, she, she, don't go.

557
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:16,990
Oh my god You haven't gotten this character yet Not yet Oh
my god Oh my god Oh my god so cute Oh it's cute

558
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:28,220
Wishing star Look how cute The art is all so cute Wow Wait,
whoa, whoa.

559
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,540
Fortune.

560
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:30,880
Background.

561
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,490
Money for gotchas first, then money for skins.

562
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,210
How do I...

563
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,090
Wait, so the shop is...

564
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,070
Is it summon?

565
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:43,390
Ah!

566
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:44,730
Here we are.

567
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,410
Uh-oh.

568
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,530
Let's learn how to...

569
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,590
Wait, what's the difference between Bamboo Club?

570
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,490
The Sakura Club.

571
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,870
Let's learn how to play first.

572
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:07,170
The more I play, because, you know, I don't want to just
spend money on them and be like, man, I hate Majang.

573
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,850
Let's keep doing the tutorials.

574
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,510
Yeah, let's keep doing the tutorials.

575
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,830
Oh, here's the Yakub.

576
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,110
I hate Majang.

577
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,710
Bamboo has men.

578
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:24,890
Oh, wait.

579
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,630
Sakura has other female characters.

580
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,690
Bamboo has male.

581
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,750
Oh, no.

582
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,750
Okay, thanks for letting me know.

583
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,670
The red mark on the table has moved.

584
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,310
That means the dealer seated east has changed.

585
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,290
This is an east wind match.

586
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,650
So the match ends when every player has been dealer one
time.

587
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,110
Don't think of running away before the match ends.

588
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,250
When the match ends, the four players will be ranked from
first to fourth.

589
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,430
Do your best to aim for first place.

590
00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:03,810
The east two in the center indicates that the match is the
second game of the East Wind Round.

591
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,270
East Wind is the current prevalent wind.

592
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,690
X69 indicates the number of tiles remaining.

593
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,750
If this number becomes zero, then the game will end even if
no one wins.

594
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,860
What does the prevalent wind mean?

595
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,660
The W in front of you indicates you are seated well.

596
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,980
in this game and West is your seat wind it's

597
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:51,710
a lot to take in but it does make sense eventually yeah
we're in the W spot a triplet of prevalent wind and a

598
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:58,850
triplet of seat wind are both very common yakus oh that's
right they said the cut okay so there was the yakus which is

599
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:08,010
which is what two through eight or so So this is also a yaku
we can have, right?

600
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:09,470
Yaku high.

601
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,730
So a triplet of a seat wind.

602
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:14,610
Okay, hold on.

603
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,370
Yaku.

604
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:16,830
One.

605
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:19,390
Yaku two.

606
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:29,230
Um, a triplet of prevalent wind.

607
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,650
So the prevalent wind would then be the, okay, east wind
round.

608
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,510
Oh, so it's because...

609
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:44,890
Wait, is it east wind round because it's east and I'm
sitting west?

610
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:45,530
Wait, no.

611
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,330
Oh, never mind.

612
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:46,770
Sorry.

613
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,750
I was confusing wind and west.

614
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:56,950
Weast?

615
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:57,770
I mean, wait.

616
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:58,470
What?

617
00:42:58,890 --> 00:42:59,250
East?

618
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,550
I thought you meant weast.

619
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,340
Okay.

620
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,600
Now it makes...

621
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:07,780
Okay.

622
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,620
I was thinking...

623
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,560
East-West round, but it's East-Wind round.

624
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,720
Okay, that makes so much more sense.

625
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,180
What's the two for, though?

626
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,760
And we are sitting West.

627
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:20,360
So we can either get the Prevalent Wind or we could get our
Seat Wind.

628
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,680
Prevalent Wind.

629
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,000
Oh, wait.

630
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,200
And a Triplet of Seat Wind.

631
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,560
So you need both.

632
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,500
Okay.

633
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,560
If you get three West Tiles, then you can win with Seat
Wind.

634
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,940
West as Yaku.

635
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,710
Oh, it's either or?

636
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,690
Because it says here and a triplet of prevalent wind and a
triplet of seat wind.

637
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,990
Oh, so, okay, or.

638
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:00,450
Triplet of prevalent wind or triplet of seat wind.

639
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,390
Both are yakus.

640
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:03,350
You can get both.

641
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:08,830
Either, either, either.

642
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,210
Read the whole sentence?

643
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,150
I did!

644
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:14,950
I did!

645
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:21,170
You can't say that to me when I literally just confused wind
for west, okay?

646
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,530
My brain is small.

647
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,650
My glasses are the wrong prescription.

648
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:38,230
If any other player discards a tile and you have two tiles
of the same kind in your hand, you can call pawn to form a

649
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:38,550
triplet.

650
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:44,170
Upon calling pawn, you shall openly place the triplet formed
in the corner of your table.

651
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,610
Don't miss this tile!

652
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:48,190
PON!

653
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:49,810
PONIA!

654
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:53,610
After you called PON successfully, discard one tile from
your hand.

655
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:54,130
Oh, okay.

656
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,310
Goodbye tile.

657
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,580
What the hell was this one?

658
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:09,360
If the player on your left discards a tile that can form a
sequence with two tiles in your hand, you can call CHI on

659
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,520
that tile.

660
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:19,540
Upon calling CHI, you shall openly place the sequence formed
in the corner of your tib-tib-tib Wait, what did they place?

661
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:20,640
The six?

662
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:21,540
Wait.

663
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,000
On my left.

664
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:23,560
Oh, hold on.

665
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,600
I need to read this again.

666
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,520
Pon and Chi can mess up your hand if you weren't careful.

667
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,240
Go to settings and turn on the tile numbers.

668
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,060
Easier for a while.

669
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,040
Yeah, I will do that.

670
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:35,400
I didn't know.

671
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,700
I thought it, because it showed it before, I thought it
would stay, but it does not.

672
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:40,340
Wait, okay.

673
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:45,620
So the player on my left discards a tile that can form a
sequence with two tiles.

674
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,520
call Chi.

675
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:49,800
Okay.

676
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,840
Chi only from left hand player.

677
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,720
Pond from any player.

678
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:56,740
Nyaruhada!

679
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:04,340
Sometimes you don't want to call Chi, but you don't
understand the bigger hands in it.

680
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,520
Yeah, I don't know anything.

681
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:08,960
Chi!

682
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:09,760
Chia!

683
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:10,660
Chia!

684
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,580
After you call Chi successfully, discard one tile from your
hand too.

685
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,120
What is this one?

686
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,340
What is that?

687
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,220
Goodbye, too.

688
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,160
Now you've reached Tenpai.

689
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,560
What was Tenpai again?

690
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:33,880
Oh, wait.

691
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,660
It's when we have a hand, but we're waiting for one thing,
right?

692
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,740
When you draw one pin or four pin,

693
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,140
yourself or someone else discards either tile, you win.

694
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,940
Yeah, one tile from winning.

695
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,380
Ready to win.

696
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,580
kind of remember

697
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:05,160
confusing kanji at the bottom is man it is this one

698
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:22,020
okay okay so i need um so they say one pin so we need the
pair right because we have okay sorry i'm gonna be like

699
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:34,220
explaining everything out so slowly for me to learn this so
we have three wait we have uh okay we have a sequence and we

700
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:57,700
have our uh our prevalent our prevalent seat wind okay so
now we just need wait and that's it so we need either we

701
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:14,420
have a we have a sequence here and we have a triplet here
one two three so then if we get this it's a pair or this

702
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:22,620
it's a pair why couldn't we oh because then it'll break the
sequence okay I get it I get it so this becomes a sequence

703
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:28,400
and or like this becomes a sequence if we get the four or
this is the sequence this is the sequence and we get the one

704
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:44,260
okay okay maybe some of us are learning together so this is
kind of good maybe okay so that would make the the yaku 1 2

705
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:49,520
3 4 okay okay okay well i got it okay okay okay

706
00:48:56,010 --> 00:49:05,010
we got this wait if you four of the same tile you can type
kan these and these tiles will be placed in the right corner

707
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:12,170
and you get to draw one tile and then discard one tile this
is called a closed kan and the quad formed here is

708
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:27,850
considered a kind of triplet oh oh oh okay closed kan shame
that we didn't win with the drawn tile let's discard it see

709
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:31,250
ya Okay, oh, oh, noon!

Yam, yam, yam.

We won the tutorial.

714
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,510
Oh my gosh.

715
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,530
I feel like I'm in Kaiji just a little bit more.

716
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,770
Congratulations on the win.

717
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,630
This is the end of today's practice session.

718
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:54,930
You can review the tutorial.

719
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:55,370
Blah, blah, blah.

720
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:55,790

Next tutorial.

725
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,100
Oh wait, oops.

726
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,240
You could say nonsense and I believe it was a mahjong term.

727
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,140
The only thing I really knew was don't.

728
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,460
I only really knew about the don't, but I didn't know what
it meant at all.

729
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,740
Now I know what it means.

730
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,280
It means I'm gonna tick your tile.

731
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:15,560
left corner there are five tiles but only one is revealed
isn't that strange i knew yaku but i didn't know what it

732
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:24,160
meant nichi is the best because you don't have to do
anything once you're in that state oh yeah no nico's win by

733
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:33,880
stealing the tile so i have a question can you only don if
you're in the what was that what was that what was that

734
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,940
state called the

735
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,120
Tempai?

736
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,080
Yes, you need to beat Tempai.

737
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,800
I'm going to write that down.

738
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:56,140
Can only don't tile from another person when in Tempai.

739
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,820
You need one more tile to win.

740
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:01,620
My notes.

741
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,620
My notes.

742
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,160
My notes.

743
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:03,820
My notes.

744
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,260
If not, it's just a poem.

745
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,540
Or Chi.

746
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,400
Ah, okay.

747
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,140
If not, it's Pon or Chi.

748
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,000
Wait, okay, so Chi is taking from the left.

749
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,520
From person on left.

750
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,320
What was the Pon again?

751
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,160
I don't remember.

752
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:28,940
Wait.

753
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,000
The game will let you make wrong calls.

754
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:32,480
That's okay.

755
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,360
Being in Tempai is like Uno in Uno.

756
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,960
Okay, okay, okay.

757
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,380
PON is for calling triplets.

758
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:50,260
Ah, okay, PON for calling triplets.

759
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,920
When you have two of a tile and someone discards the third.

760
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,840
Okay, okay.

761
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,680
Okay, thank you.

762
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,320
Taking.

763
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,080
Okay, okay.

764
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,940
And chi is for taking the person, from the person.

765
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,640
The chi is for sequence, but only for the, okay.

766
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:22,120
taking my person on the left but only for sequence so you
can't do chi for okay so if I take from the person on my

767
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,020
left and it's for a triplet it would just be a poem

768
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:36,470
chi is for sequence and you can only take from the person
before you pon is for triplets you can take from anyway ah

769
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:37,230
okay okay

770
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:47,650
you don't have to worry about the left side thing in this
since it won't let you But it's still good to know in case I

771
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:51,710
play outside of Majang Sol, right?

772
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:58,290
So, it's going to be confusing at first.

773
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:00,510
Yeah, but that's okay.

774
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,650
I think I'm already understanding slowly.

775
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:13,270
I'm getting, I'm knowing I'm really, I'm really, I'm
understanding better than I did before when I tried.

776
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:21,930
The best advice I have about mahjong is to avoid calling
tiles until you recognize the yaku that you're building.

777
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,510
Okay, wait, what do you mean by calling titles?

778
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:29,610
Like by putting them over here on the right side of me over
here?

779
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:32,490
Good advice.

780
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,050
By calling cheer poem?

781
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:35,870
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

782
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:43,350
Stealing your okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, I'm gonna write that down.

783
00:54:45,630 --> 00:55:01,110
equals taking tiles stealing tiles becoming a criminal of
tiles okay cool so in that regard it feels like poker

784
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:11,970
because aren't you supposed to hide your hand in poker for
so long crimes crimes I don't know so many vtuber fans knew

785
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:12,750
how to play mahjong.

786
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:21,390
I've always been so fascinated when I go to an anime
convention because there's without doubt always a group of

787
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:24,810
people that are just playing mahjong like somewhere on the
floor.

788
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:33,830
So I've always been so fascinated to try and learn how to
play because it seems fun.

789
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:40,730
If it's so fun that there's people that are just like
sitting around playing mahjong.

790
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:53,950
there are at least four of us i've never seen that that's
crazy really i feel like i've always seen it i have a set i

791
00:55:53,950 --> 00:56:03,270
bring to furry cons no way how do you hold them in your
furry paws this is where mind games come in if you're

792
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:08,890
calling tiles it also makes it more likely to let the other
players figure out what hand you have yeah that's where like

793
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:11,410
i said where it feels like poker Hi Emily!

794
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:16,670
Oh god.

795
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,170
I should watch Saki.

796
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:21,270
I should finish Saki.

797
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:25,530
I saw a group of Zombieland Saga cosplayers playing Majang.

798
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:27,030
Okay.

799
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,470
This is the Dora.

800
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:28,990
Oh my gosh.

801
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:29,590
Dora.

802
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:31,550
Dora.

803
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:32,490
Dora.

804
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:33,830
Dora, Dora.

805
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:35,650
She's a gambler.

806
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:36,310
Dora!

807
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:39,310
Oh my god, she got into Majang.

808
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:40,050
Dora!

809
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:45,490
Oh my god, boots, she sold boots off to pay for off her
debts.

810
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:47,690
Dora the majeunger.

811
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:51,710
The majeunger.

812
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,670
Dora the gambler.

813
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:58,970
They will indicate the shining Dora tiles.

814
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:04,450
The tiles, wait, the tile next in order after the revealed
indicator tile is Dora.

815
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,670
If the one man is revealed.

816
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:08,630
Ah!

817
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:09,950
Oh, oh, that scared me.

818
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:13,110
Then the two man in your hand is Dora.

819
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:14,230
Huh?

820
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:19,150
Swiper, no swiping credit cards.

821
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:22,510
Wait, what?

822
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,100
Soy gambler!

823
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:32,900
Hola!

824
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,520
Okay, this confused me the most.

825
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:39,660
Shiny tiles equals more points, basically.

826
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:42,220
Okay.

827
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,860
Dora is the next tile from the revealed tile.

828
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,620
Shiny tiles equals bonus points.

829
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:56,700
So if I have

830
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,850
but this one's shiny.

831
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:03,170
The two.

832
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:08,950
The tile necks in order after the revealed and then...

833
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:13,270
Oh, so because this is revealed, then this would be the
shiny, the Dora.

834
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:17,950
It's sorry, not the... Wait.

835
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:19,010
It's Dora.

836
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,030
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

837
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:25,530
Is it just in my hand or...

838
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:31,470
So if you're like trying to really big brain it, you would
want to get like a sequence with the Dora.

839
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:36,710
With Dora or like a triplet Dora or something like that.

840
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,290
Dora's are for everyone.

841
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:39,450
Okay.

842
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:42,410
So if one is revealed, then two is Dora.

843
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,170
Okay, okay, okay.

844
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,050
More Dora, the better.

845
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:49,410
Yummy point.

846
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,290
Okay, okay, okay.

847
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:53,870
You guys are so helpful today.

848
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:54,810
Oh my gosh.

849
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,310
Thank you guys.

850
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:02,050
When you win, the more Dora tiles you have in your hand, the
more points you win.

851
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:05,850
Oh, I didn't even...

852
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:08,410
It's not even letting me put anything down.

853
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:11,370
It's like you're still too stupid, okay?

854
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:12,850
Oh, another Yaku.

855
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,430
Another Yaku is...

856
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:14,910
Richi.

857
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:17,090
Richi.

858
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:19,810
Okay.

859
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:24,170
When Richi is possible, the following button will appear.

860
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:28,290
You need to pay 1,000 points as Richi bet.

861
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:30,790
Richi is best yaku.

862
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:39,210
Okay, when you have neither all simples nor triplet of
prevalent seat wind, what can you do?

863
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:42,370
Since we haven't called chi or pon yet, we can call Richi.

864
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,430
It's also a very common yaku.

865
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,250
Okay, so I don't have...

866
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,450
All Simples.

867
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,420
Nor a triplet of...

868
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:00,780
Okay.

869
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:02,320
Okay.

870
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,740
It's the lock-in button.

871
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:11,620
When need to use possible, the following button will appear.

872
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,240
Wait, call is not allowed.

873
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,980
Because this is the triplet of the prevalent or seat wind.

874
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,740
Because it's east wind.

875
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,900
Or I'm sitting west.

876
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:34,400
right so that's why i can't call the dc because i have to
have neither all symbols

877
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:50,360
the dc button is so satisfying to press once you're dc you
can't see your point or or what Bajai, was you right?

878
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:54,890
Hello, Mind.

879
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:58,130
My favorite vegetable introduced me to your lives, and I'm
enjoying it.

880
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:02,750
Can you send a hug to Lucas for me, please?

881
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:03,910
Hugs from Brazil.

882
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:04,990
Thanks, Roy.

883
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:06,670
Hi, Lucas.

884
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:09,330
If you feel a chill, it's me.

885
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:12,970
Thank you.

886
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:16,030
Game will play itself once you go into DG.

887
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:16,710
Oh, really?

888
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:17,110
Okay.

889
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:18,270
Well, I'm just going to keep going.

890
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:26,390
Tap the Ritchie button, pay 1000 points as Ritchie bet and
discard a tile to make your hand tempai Okay, so hold on.

891
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,530
Let's see why this makes it tempai.

892
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:35,790
So we have a sequence one sequence two sequence a triplet

893
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:47,770
So that's three Thanks takizou you can meet you as long as
you haven't stolen any tiles that round doesn't have to be

894
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,570
all simple Oh, okay, okay, okay.

895
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:51,870
And then we have four pair.

896
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:56,990
So all we would need is another sequel.

897
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:59,150
We didn't need a five or an eight, right?

898
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:00,790
Mm.

899
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:03,270
So that's why we get rid of this.

900
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:06,990
Okay.

901
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:08,930
Nietzsche.

902
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:15,210
While paying a thousand points is a pain, and you can't
change your hand after calling Nietzsche, you will have

903
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:19,930
Nietzsche as Yaku, and you only need to draw a tile, discard
it until you win.

904
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:25,950
But I can't steal, so I have to be lucky.

905
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:27,510
I win!

906
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:28,590
Ipatzuma!

907
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:32,090
Okay.

908
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:39,390
Ipatz is a yaku that comes into effect if the player wins
within the next turn after declaring Richi, i.e.

909
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:43,130
before their next discard, without interruptions from other
players' calls.

910
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:43,770
Oh my gosh.

911
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:45,870
Friendinator, think you're the Akasuba!

912
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:48,250
It's dangerous to gotcha without money.

913
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:49,470
Here, take this.

914
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:50,270
No!

915
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:52,690
Thank you!

916
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:55,610
Thank you so much.

917
01:02:56,450 --> 01:03:01,410
As a reward for winning with Niti, you also get the chance
to have another Dora coming into effect.

918
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:05,350
Let's check out what the Ura Dora tile is.

919
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:06,050
Tzumo.

920
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:08,710
Oh!

921
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:13,010
Hidden Dora.

922
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,250
We had no...

923
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:18,450
We had no hidden Dora though.

924
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,730
No, no Uradora.

925
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:26,190
Zanen.

926
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:28,590
Yippee!

927
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:33,610
It's a pity we didn't have any Uradora tiles in our hand.

928
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:38,470
But even like this, we win with bigger winning points since
we have both Bichi and Ipatz.

929
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:39,550
Okay.

930
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,370
Congratulations on the win!

931
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:46,470
This is the end of today's bl-l-l-l-l-l-l-l.

932
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:46,810
Okay.

933
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,850
Okay, so Ipatz.

934
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,390
I didn't write anything.

935
01:03:51,410 --> 01:04:09,390
for Dichi wait I wrote no notes for Dichi okay can call when
you when you haven't called chi or poem like

936
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:26,360
Nietzsche is just click it if you see it but like and then
nipatz is when after Dichi thank you nipatz when after win

937
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,540
right after calling Li-Ti.

938
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:35,520
and all, and all, know all symbols or wins.

939
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,200
And know all symbols or wins.

940
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,540
So, I'm kind of confused.

941
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:48,360
What's like the, what's like the benefit of calling Li-Ti?

942
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,540
Oh, it's just a Yaquan.

943
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,020
Li-Ti is riskier, but worth more points.

944
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,660
Okay, okay, okay.

945
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,240
You don't need any other yaku.

946
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,980
Ah, ah, ah,

947
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:13,160
ah.

948
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:22,870
More yaku is more points so it can stack.

949
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:31,260
Richie is a yaku easy to get because game is called Richie
Majongajong.

950
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,200
I don't know.

951
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,420
If you win with a Richie, you'll be rich.

952
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:45,380
My friend asked me how much I had to super to get you to
play Majang.

953
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:49,300
I'm so glad my Kamiyoshi is finally playing one of my
favorite games.

954
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,160
Thanks, Nicholas!

955
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,960
Help me out then.

956
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,240
Thank you.

957
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,380
You can only get Uradora.

958
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:58,980
Oh, okay.

959
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,100
Only...

960
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:09,980
You can only get Uradora if you win...

961
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:22,760
Let me write Dora, Dora equals bonus point shiny special
tile.

962
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:32,340
You can ignore all other Yaku, so very beginner friendly.

963
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,340
You're a certified grandma now after this?

964
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:45,820
have one more chapter and then I gotta do the test which I'm
really scared for.

965
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:49,300
Okay.

966
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,740
Oh, you're awake!

967
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,000
Did I die?

968
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,020
I have played the game halfway for you, yeah.

969
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,140
Check out your hand.

970
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,000
We have so many mandiles, yeah!

971
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,600
Sorry, this hand looks a bit weird.

972
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:06,160
Okay.

973
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,000
Simply, Yaku, half,

974
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,980
Is this the...

975
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,020
Wait, what was it called?

976
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:18,780
Like a...

977
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,580
She's sabotaging you.

978
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,120
I'm afraid it's been nine years.

979
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,480
Look at your arm.

980
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:33,220
No!

981
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:34,240
No!

982
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,280
Bro, if these are simple, what's a complex, Yaku?

983
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:43,940
For real?

984
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:47,220
all right okay

985
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:06,460
may only contain number tiles of one suit and triplet or
pair of honor tiles okay can only contain number tiles of

986
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:23,560
one suit and triplet or pair of honor tiles so the honor
tiles are the the um the dragon one right

987
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:33,700
uh dragons wind wind and dragons okay

988
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:53,280
okay okay while it is worth three han after you make a call
the worth will be one hand less i.e.

989
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:59,740
become two hand okay this hand is aiming for a yaku called
half flesh where aside from honor tiles all the number tiles

990
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:09,520
belong to one suit currently we're waiting for one four
seven month oh my gosh one one one two three four five six

991
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,180
seven making this a very advantageous hand

992
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,560
but why are we waiting for the one or the four or the seven
wait

993
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:31,790
13 orphans Sounds scary

994
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:42,950
Oh I can't Oh I'm looking at this like it's my hand I'm a
dummy Sorry it's alright Yeah you're right you're right We

995
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:54,590
can't see our Okay okay Yes down here Down here is our hand
Okay It's a meme hand 13 orphans But as we discarded the one

996
01:09:54,590 --> 01:10:02,190
man before That means we are in Tempai Waiting for tiles,
including the one that was discarded before by ourselves.

997
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:04,950
This status is called discard Furi-ten.

998
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:07,510
Oh, okay.

999
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:09,210
So, yeah, we're waiting for one.

1000
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:12,230
Five, six, seven.

1001
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:12,790
Oh.

1002
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:20,560
When one is in Furi-ten, they can only win by Tzumo.

1003
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:21,900
Okay, hold on.

1004
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:27,440
When in Furi-ten, you can only win by Tzumo.

1005
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:37,150
And not run.

1006
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:41,130
Oh.

1007
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:45,370
Calling on another player's discard.

1008
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:53,710
I'm just... I feel like, you know when you like take notes
from a class and you just type exactly what was written on

1009
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:57,590
the PowerPoint that the teacher had on the board, that's how
I feel right now.

1010
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:01,150
Furi-ten is bad, basically.

1011
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:04,550
Okay.

1012
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:12,450
Aside from discard Furi-ten, are also two other types of
Furi-ten called temporary Furi-ten and Dichi Furi-ten.

1013
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:14,510
But I won't go deep into these here, Nya.

1014
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:15,390
Thank you.

1015
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:18,790
Oh, goodbye.

1016
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:27,020
Girl, we can't wait for the other three players to discard
any of the winning tiles on this situation.

1017
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:29,620
Try to draw the winning tile on your own.

1018
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:30,980
Believe in yourself.

1019
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:37,500
That's a win by Tumo for you!

1020
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,440
Good job!

1021
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:39,920
Summonia!

1022
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,360
Summonia!

1023
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:42,220
Chang!

1024
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:49,310
Mm-hmm.

1025
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:51,390
Yippee!

1026
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:54,170
It's not like it was a tutorial or anything.

1027
01:11:57,210 --> 01:12:11,570
So, so if I, if I were to have, uh, won by DT, wait, no, if
I were to have gotten, use these, the, the soul, the soul

1028
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:13,250

Taki, thanks for the gifting.

1034
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:54,110
Thank you.

1035
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,070
Three soul would be the Dora, but not usable in your head.

1036
01:12:57,230 --> 01:12:57,710
No, no, no.

1037
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,790
Not usable in my head.

1038
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:01,290
Okay.

1039
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,730
That's why I was saying if I had Richid, then that would
have been...

1040
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:08,690
I'm just applying what I learned in the last episode.

1041
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:10,510
Okay.

1042
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:12,770
Murphy, thanks for the five gifting theme.

1043
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:23,150
money okay let's go over what we learned oh hi there new
player my name is Ichihime never played mahjong before oh

1044
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:33,810
well let me teach you that okay 34 different tiles so we
have the man we have the pin we have so let's see remember

1045
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:46,530

which pin will miss melchan thank you for the vibe you Thank

1046
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:46,930
you.

1047
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,710
If you don't memorize the number slash wins, everyone will
think you're a scrub.

1048
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:52,630
I am a scrub.

1049
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:54,010
I am a scrub.

1050
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:55,250
I don't know what I'm doing.

1051
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:58,970
So one man, two man, three man.

1052
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:00,110
Then you have the pin whales.

1053
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:01,990
Then you have the so tall bamboo.

1054
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:03,510
Then you have the wins.

1055
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:05,430
Because wind goes in east direction.

1056
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:06,570
Wind goes in south direction.

1057
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:07,430
Wind goes in west direction.

1058
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:08,450
Wind goes in north direction.

1059
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:09,650
Then you have the dragons.

1060
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:12,270
The dragon, there are two dragons inside of me.

1061
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:13,870
understand?

1062
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:20,150
The objective of Majong is to win, of course.

1063
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:21,310
So how do you win a game?

1064
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:24,550
In a game, each player usually has 13 tiles in hand.

1065
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:26,630
No.

1066
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:31,450
But there are three dragons.

1067
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:41,100
There are three dragons inside of me.

1068
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:47,400
There's no, okay, this is what, see, this is the kind, this
is Naka, so inside.

1069
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:51,440
So then you have the dragon, and then Then you have the who?

1070
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:53,060
Dragon.

1071
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,500
Is it weird that I'm kind of super invested in you learning
mahjong now?

1072
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:00,240
You have gah.

1073
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,560
Then you have who?

1074
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:03,280
Who?

1075
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,620
Who is that I mean?

1076
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:09,740
Nice memorization.

1077
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:11,100
Thank you!

1078
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,380
Discard the dragon you don't want.

1079
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:21,400
Oh, sorry, not the dragon.

1080
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,740
Discard the card you don't want.

1081
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,700
And we have to get...

1082
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:33,080
Certain conditions and every turn you will draw a tile so
the number of tiles becomes 14 and you shall discard What

1083
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:33,860
from your head?

1084
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:34,620
Why am I yawning?

1085
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:43,660
I had coffee We have to okay before explaining how to win
first understand three terms sequences Triplets and pairs

1086
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:50,800
first we have pairs two identical Then we have triplets
three identical and then we have a sequence three

1087
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:58,740
consecutive tiles of the same group easy peasy this one this
part's easy this part's easy Yeah, 5, 6, 7, so tall bamboos.

1088
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,900
7, 8, 9 people.

1089
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:04,220
Oh, 7, 8, 9 people.

1090
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:06,260
That's a lot of people to eat.

1091
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,680
And then 4, 5, 6 pinwheels.

1092
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:10,680
Pin.

1093
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:16,540
Usually when your hand consists of four sequences or
triplets, plus one pair, you are ready to win, master.

1094
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:20,640
Of course, in me, Tsumajong, you must satisfy other
conditions to declare a win.

1095
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:21,780
We will cover them later.

1096
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,760
So, we have to get...

1097
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:34,080
Um, four sequences or triplets, so we can have one sequence,
three triplets, two triplets, two sequences, but we also

1098
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:34,780
need a pair.

1099
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:39,040
And other conditions.

1100
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,140
This is the most important sign.

1101
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,280
Yeah.

1102
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:49,700
Mm.

1103
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:55,660
You can also do four sequences or four triplets.

1104
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:59,540
Yes, you could do four sequences or four triplets.

1105
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:00,600
Yes.

1106
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:01,780
Thank you.

1107
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:04,440
Yeah, the other conditions are the yaku.

1108
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:08,400
So there's, so far I know four different yaku.

1109
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:11,600
Yeah.

1110
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,620
Of course, your hand also often consists of 13 tiles only.

1111
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,600
So you need one more to win.

1112
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:24,060
When you just need one more tile to win, this hand is called
tempai.

1113
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:30,900
step necessary step before winning so make sure you pay
attention to it so the

1114
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:43,340
so if we have four five if we have a if we get six then we
would win because we would have this three sequences

1115
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:52,200
triplets and what this would make another or we could get a
three we get a three or a six and then that would be the

1116
01:17:52,200 --> 01:18:14,220
pair my are all pairs easy to remember that does sound easy
okay that's correct seven pairs is a yakutu yes wait seven

1117
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:23,360
pairs really did I learn that one it's

1118
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:40,770
also a meme hat you can make seven pairs seven pairs is bad
which tile does the hand need for winning oh let's see we

1119
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:53,510
got we have a pair here of twos four five six we have a
sequence three four oh probably this two right well one

1120
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:58,210
sequence two sequence three sequence two

1121
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:06,350
Statistically speaking, you're close to seven pairs once you
have five in your hand.

1122
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:17,490
Which tile does the hand need for winning?

1123
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:18,210
Okay.

1124
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:20,070
Oh.

1125
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:23,110
Oh, shoot.

1126
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:27,530
This would be our pair.

1127
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:28,910
Right?

1128
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:29,590
Yeah.

1129
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:31,790
We need the three because we need the pair.

1130
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:32,350
Right?

1131
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:34,330
Yippee!

1132
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:39,330
Yeah!

1133
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:40,290
Okay.

1134
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:45,490
Okay.

1135
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,120
Wait.

1136
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:53,980
Am I dumb?

1137
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,480
We don't have...

1138
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:02,660
Actually, I don't understand.

1139
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,940
No, you're smart.

1140
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,860
Oh, it turns this one into a pair and then one two...

1141
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:20,000
This is the pair.

1142
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,200
I was like,

1143
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:29,160
I knew that the whole time.

1144
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,320
I knew that the whole time she failed successfully.

1145
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:42,050
Yep.

1146
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:49,850
Yup.

1147
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:53,010
A winning hand must contain a yaku.

1148
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:55,210
If you achieve 10-5, I have no yaku.

1149
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:57,250
A no yaku notice will be shown.

1150
01:20:57,650 --> 01:20:58,390
That's so scary.

1151
01:20:58,570 --> 01:20:59,470
That sounds so scary.

1152
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:02,170
Simple yaku.

1153
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:02,850
Yakuhai.

1154
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:08,410
You know, I don't think I wrote these.

1155
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:11,350
Yakuhai.

1156
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:12,530
Which yaku I'm doing.

1157
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:16,710
So this is the one where you refer to the...

1158
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:18,210
Oh wait, no.

1159
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,730
Yeah, this is the one with...

1160
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:28,810
The triplets of the prevalent wind or the seat wind?

1161
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:30,430
Or the dragon?

1162
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:31,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1163
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,140
Three dragon tiles or...

1164
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,140
Yeah, or the dragon tiles.

1165
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:52,550
Yakuhai equals three dragons or seat wind, east wind.

1166
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:54,090
Okay.

1167
01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:57,410
All symbols.

1168
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:01,090
Oops, all simples.

1169
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,650
Okay, yes, this is all, okay, all simples.

1170
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:09,130
Oops, all simples.

1171
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:10,990
No yaku.

1172
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:12,910
No yaku.

1173
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:20,020
There are some yaku cheat sheets you can look up for quick
reference sheet.

1174
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:24,740
I might need it because I'm writing all this down, but I'm
more of a visual person than anything else.

1175
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,360
So, hmm.

1176
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,660
Writing it down might be completely pointless for me.

1177
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:42,440
You must not have any of the tiles below, which is 1 and 9,
or any of the wins, or any of the dragons.

1178
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,280
Okay, Niti.

1179
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:50,900
When Niti is possible, the following button will appear.

1180
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,880
And then I have to pay a thousand points.

1181
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:57,580
When you achieve Tempai without calling Ti, Pon, or Kan.

1182
01:22:59,240 --> 01:22:59,760
Yes.

1183
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:01,440
Kan.

1184
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:02,380
Kamen child.

1185
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,220
Called Ti or Pon or Kan.

1186
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,140
And no simple...

1187
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:07,320
Wait.

1188
01:23:12,410 --> 01:23:13,570
Wait, is it no...

1189
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:15,290
No all symbols or wins?

1190
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:17,970
Oh wait, so it's gotta be...

1191
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:19,950
No all symbols and no all wins, right?

1192
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:24,910
Closed Kan from your own hand is allowed.

1193
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:26,230
Oh, let me write that down too.

1194
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:28,010
Closed Kan.

1195
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:33,530
You can have all symbols or wins.

1196
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:43,750
wins you can okay i wrote that down maybe i misunderstood um
okay it doesn't matter what you have in your hand okay okay

1197
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:52,110
okay all wins is a billion points since it's giga rare are

1198
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:12,280
know dichi lets you win even if you don't have anything else
okay going on a trip so i can't watch the stream we'll watch

1199
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:16,500
the vibe later have fun wrecking your brain and Majong, it
ate all my brain cells when I played it.

1200
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:17,360
Thanks, Mason!

1201
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:18,720
Thank you!

1202
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,460
Which of the following sequence is a Yaku?

1203
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,120
Yaku...

1204
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,020
East?

1205
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,280
It's an East game, and we're East Seat.

1206
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:34,300
So East.

1207
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,320
Seekai, niya!

1208
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:41,380
Nice.

1209
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:55,620
Which tile should you discard if you want achieve tanyao for
all wait for all symbols you must not have any oh wait we

1210
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:56,530
can't have the one

1211
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:14,400
i wish they wouldn't switch between the terminology either
call it all symbols forever or call it tanyao forever you

1212
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:18,780
know what i mean or at least always put like like tanyao

1213
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,100
Parentheses, simple's.

1214
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:24,200
Mm-mm.

1215
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:29,700
Now that we have learned the tiles and some yaku, let's
check out the game interface.

1216
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:32,220
Master, please look at the screen above.

1217
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,300
I shall explain to you one by one, yeah.

1218
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,260
East one.

1219
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:40,480
Means that you are the first game of the East Wind Round.

1220
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:43,260
East is your current round wind.

1221
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:45,560
67 means the tiles remaining.

1222
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:48,420
Uh...

1223
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:51,000
My points.

1224
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,260
Discard tiles.

1225
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,180
Discard tiles you don't want.

1226
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:58,660
Or tiles you don't want.

1227
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,820
You can call the discard tiles for ti pong kan.

1228
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:06,420
Chi is the call to complete a sequence.

1229
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,400
Chi is...

1230
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,860
Chi is when...

1231
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:13,820
Hold on.

1232
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,780
Chi is...

1233
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,720
When I...

1234
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:27,160
call from the person on my left for the sequence.

1235
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:34,060
She is a yoink for sequence, correct?

1236
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:35,400
YIVY!

1237
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,000
YIVY!

1238
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:45,540
Okay.

1239
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:48,810
Um...

1240
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,060
So yeah, okay.

1241
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:55,630
Last player, left side, discarded tile form a sequence with
two tiles, so...

1242
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:57,480
Six...

1243
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,840
8, and they drop the 7.

1244
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:06,160
Here the 7-pin discarded by the last player could be used to
form a sequence of 6-7-8-pin.

1245
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,080
PON is when anybody...

1246
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,600
PON is when somebody, anybody...

1247
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:18,140
Places a tile, discards a tile that I want to steal.

1248
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:19,720
And I go steal!

1249
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,640
And then I take it for...

1250
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,700
Okay, for...

1251
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,400
For...

1252
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:26,900
Triplet.

1253
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:35,600
Steel!

1254
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:36,900
Yoink!

1255
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:40,580
Hey guys, I'm here in the Florida Everglades.

1256
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,560
Oh look, a shiny spider.

1257
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:43,140
Yoink.

1258
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:44,780
A shiny tile.

1259
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:45,580
Yoink.

1260
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,100
Full on Konosuba Steel.

1261
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:48,880
Yeah.

1262
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,320
The steel, just like the fear.

1263
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:56,880
Hi.

1264
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:58,040
Hi this.

1265
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:58,700
Hi.

1266
01:27:59,500 --> 01:27:59,620
Minto.

1267
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,760
Are you guys watching Konosuba?

1268
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,160
the season two?

1269
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:09,180
Yes.

1270
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:10,960
So let's make the triplet home.

1271
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:13,760
This is the call to complete a quad.

1272
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:17,180
Khan can be called on discarded tiles from any player.

1273
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:24,380
You can also make a Khan call when you have four identical
tiles in your hand or has a previously melded triplet.

1274
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,380
That's why I confused.

1275
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:34,060
Season three.

1276
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,040
Wait, what did I say?

1277
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,720
Wait, what did I, did I say?

1278
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:54,730
say like people were oh did i say season two oh my bad yeah
i meant season three my bad my bad so people were saying

1279
01:28:54,730 --> 01:29:05,630
that con is not so great people is this one kind of only
used if i am desperate oh

1280
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:22,240
yes I meant this see yes see I was like I don't think I said
which sees which season number it was so yes I was meaning I

1281
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:32,640
was saying like are you watching it this season to as in are
you watching it this season as well Khan reveals more Dora

1282
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:38,620
oh does it this calls to complete a quad okay Let me write
Khan.

1283
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:42,440
I don't think I wrote Khan down.

1284
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:55,670
Khan equals calling to complete a quad.

1285
01:29:57,170 --> 01:29:59,810
It can be called on discarded tiles from any player.

1286
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,690
You can also make a Khan call when you have four identical
tiles.

1287
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:04,750
That's the closed Khan, right?

1288
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:08,410
If I call it on the ones that are in my hand?

1289
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:14,390
It's bad at higher expert play.

1290
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:16,070
It's fine at lower mid-level play.

1291
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:17,210
Oh, okay, okay.

1292
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:21,370
Khan will reveal more Dora, which might give your opponent
an advantage too.

1293
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:22,650
Oh, okay, okay.

1294
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:24,550
Close Khan is best for you.

1295
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:25,470
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

1296
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:51,540
When identical tiles in your hand or have a previously
melded triplet the fourth tile.

1297
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,020
Oh, interesting.

1298
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:57,980
Okay.

1299
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:58,380
Okay.

1300
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:03,240
Learning the basic hand composition and the yaku is a lot
more simple than it seems at first.

1301
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:05,240
The real challenge is figuring out the scoring.

1302
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:11,760
It might help to watch Saki just so you can see all the yaku
man hands that you'll only get with MC luck.

1303
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:13,900
True, true, true.

1304
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,220
Kan is the Saki finisher.

1305
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,540
This is making me want to watch Saki though.

1306
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:27,040
Which of the following hands can tea the sixth from the last
player?

1307
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:33,380
Tea is the, oh my gosh, the sequence.

1308
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,840
So it would be this one.

1309
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,480
Which snack do you want to have first?

1310
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:41,740
I'm not a snack, yeah?

1311
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:43,220
What are you talking about?

1312
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:46,780
Which of the following hands can pawn from another player?

1313
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:49,180
Pon is a triplet, so this one.

1314
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:52,440
YIVY!

1315
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,780
Okay, Chi sequence.

1316
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,620
Pon triplet.

1317
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:00,720
Chi sequence.

1318
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,460
Pon triplet.

1319
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,320
Chi sequence.

1320
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:03,060
Pon triplet.

1321
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:03,840
Chi sequence.

1322
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:04,660
Pon triplet.

1323
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:05,860
Si, chi sequence.

1324
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:06,680
Pon triplet.

1325
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:12,120
That's enough the basic rules master.

1326
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:13,700
Remember we have learned the tile groups.

1327
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:15,640
Mind soul, ping, wind and dragon.

1328
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:20,260
Three simple yaku, yaku, Go high, all simple is in DT, the
equation of winning.

1329
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:22,680
Four sequences or triplets plus one pair.

1330
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:29,160
You can practice your skills with AI by creating a private
game room, or if you are interested in more advanced rules,

1331
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,680
you can find them by tapping the question mark icon on the
top right corner.

1332
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:34,240
I'm going to sleep, yeah.

1333
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,180
We did it!

1334
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:43,490
Tutorial, oh my gosh, I graduated.

1335
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:45,130
Look at my little hat.

1336
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:48,150
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, what does this do?

1337
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:49,950
How cute!

1338
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:54,290
That's so fun.

1339
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:57,890
Okay.

1340
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:03,470
Send help, I'm stuck in Majong Limbo, I can't get out of
bronze.

1341
01:33:05,010 --> 01:33:07,990
One of my most recent matches I lost in the first draw?

1342
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:10,450
Am I gonna be okay?

1343
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:15,010
Okay, I think what I'm gonna do...

1344
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:19,760
I think I should do gotcha.

1345
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,940
And then I will play a game against the AI.

1346
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,080
I think I will do the gotcha.

1347
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:29,980
And then I will play the game against the AI.

1348
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,120
How much is it to summon 10 times?

1349
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:46,620
Purchase.

1350
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,420
Wait, I'm scared.

1351
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:48,660
Is it going to show something?

1352
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:49,140
Hold on.

1353
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,680
I'm getting rid of the window real quick.

1354
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:51,780
Oh, okay.

1355
01:33:54,400 --> 01:34:00,540
Do you know that in the manga Akagi, there was a single
maijan game that took 20 real life years to finish?

1356
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:14,420
a single night in the mongo 20 years real life it's like 40
dollar wait what okay hold on how much is it you need 1800.

I got this one, at least.

1362
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,000
Yippee!

1363
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:48,560
I don't think I have anything.

1364
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:50,620
Oh, under the event.

1365
01:34:58,540 --> 01:34:59,020
Mutsuki.

1366
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:06,440
Not this event.

1367
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:08,260
The button that says event.

1368
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:11,240
Oh, this one.

1369
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:20,450

1372
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,240
And what does it mean first purchase?

1373
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:02,080
Oh, like the first purchase, I'll get the bonus, but usually
I won't get the bonus.

1374
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:04,300
That's so messed up.

1375
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:14,290
Okay.

1376
01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:17,870

Mutsuki.

1444
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,980
I shouldn't have said that.

1445
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:01,480
I shouldn't have said that.

1446
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:03,200

She is.

1454
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:20,960
Clearly the solution is to overload PayPal with money, so it
explodes its hours here with our donuts.

1455
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:24,680
No, no, no.

1456

Musuki at the bottom, Saj.

1457
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,620
It's because...

01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:33,240
Shiroko has to be at the top for me because she's my Seiyu
Oshi.

The thingy.

1516

The Ritchie effects and music are far more fun thing to get

1517
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:10,320

01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:44,380
Items can be gifted to characters to bond them.

1529
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:48,600
Oh, you need to get five bond hearts to unlock the
characters' voice lines for Yaku.

1530
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:49,540
Ah!

1531
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:51,540

Um...

1535
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:07,180
Maybe it's worth getting the 2400 since you get the bonus
2400.

1536
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:10,540
Wait, what?

1537
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:12,240

1538
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:14,540

1542
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:20,900

1543
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,140
I didn't even see that!

1544
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:23,040
Oh!

1545
01:48:25,180 --> 01:48:25,660

1546
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:28,160
Oh my gosh.

1547
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:29,640

01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:40,080

while prepping.

1550
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:40,780
Good luck with the gacha.

1551
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:41,780
Oh my gosh.

Zesby?

1556
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:47,840
Congratulations!

1557
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:50,500

1558
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:53,520

I do.

1564
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:38,960
La la la la la la la.

1565
01:49:44,170 --> 01:49:45,050
I'm actually...

1566
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:47,450
You know, I could use this on actual Blue Archive.

1567
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:48,690
Am I stupid?

1568
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:52,910
I've...

1569
01:49:52,910 --> 01:49:56,530
To be honest, I'm spending more on this than I've spent in
actual Blue Archive.

1570
01:49:57,550 --> 01:49:58,550
Is that kind of crazy?

1571
01:50:02,030 --> 01:50:02,470
Okay.

1572
01:50:09,170 --> 01:50:09,810
Whatever.

1573
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:12,730
Kind of crazy.

1574
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:17,320
Summon.

1575
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:23,200
So this gives me how many how many summons.

1576
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:27,660
Someone help, please.

1577
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:28,540
Fake me!

1578
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,760
Totally not for gotcha.

1579
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:32,560
Thank you for the akatsupa.

1580
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:33,220
Thank you.

1581
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:36,540
Two?

1582
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:38,360
With some left over.

1583
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:48,540
Purple.

1584
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:56,980
I got a bone?

1585
01:50:57,860 --> 01:50:59,220
I got a bone to pick with you.

1586
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:01,420
Railgun event is soon too.

1587
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:03,480
It's okay, I have some jemmies saved up.

1588
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:08,800
Laser blast.

1589
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:10,220
We

1590
01:51:13,410 --> 01:51:14,410
got the pet out all.

1591
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:17,990
At least we got that, I guess.

1592
01:51:22,290 --> 01:51:23,610
Oh, you're right.

1593
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:25,110
I don't...

1594
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:29,450
It's like almost enough to do a second one.

1595
01:51:30,590 --> 01:51:32,050
Or a third one, I mean.

1596
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:37,410
Whooshah!

1597
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:46,290
Are there...

1598
01:51:47,070 --> 01:51:47,870
Um...

1599
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:48,450
Can the...

1600
01:51:48,450 --> 01:51:49,430
Can the...

1601
01:51:49,430 --> 01:51:52,310
Can the game...

1602
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:53,370
Like, uh...

1603
01:51:53,370 --> 01:51:54,710
Wow, gorgeous dress.

1604
01:51:55,150 --> 01:51:56,430
You have terrible luck.

1605
01:51:56,950 --> 01:51:57,750
Um...

1606
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:00,170
Yeah, actually, I do.

1607
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:04,970
This is like, it's part of my, um, it's part of my charm.

1608
01:52:05,730 --> 01:52:09,130
It's just, it's one of my, it's one of my charm points.

1609
01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:12,510
How, how bad my luck is.

1610
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:16,450
This is some of the worst I've seen.

1611
01:52:16,610 --> 01:52:17,110
Sorry, man.

1612
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:18,010
That's okay.

1613
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:24,730
It's part of my charm point that I have such bad luck.

1614
01:52:26,010 --> 01:52:28,550
Going to my first Hollow Life concert tomorrow, I'm super
excited.

1615
01:52:29,190 --> 01:52:36,990
I'm going to be a billion times more excited if such when
you decide to do a concert and I can go to that too.

1616
01:52:37,070 --> 01:52:38,570
Oh my gosh, how fun though, Pat!

1617
01:52:39,810 --> 01:52:41,210
Wait, what's the concert?

1618
01:52:44,130 --> 01:52:44,690
Okay.

1619
01:52:45,590 --> 01:52:51,350
How much do I need to to get, what is it, 800?

1620
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:59,420
Oh, Dreamhack in Melbourne!

1621
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:01,020
Melbourne.

1622
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:03,140
Melbourne.

1623
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:04,780
Melbourne.

1624
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:06,320
The $5 one.

1625
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:08,560
Six.

1626
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:09,300
Okay, you're right.

1627
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:10,060
Okay.

1628
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:11,500
Goodbye.

1629
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:12,660
$5.

1630
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:15,400
To you, my young soul.

1631
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:17,000
Melbourne.

1632
01:53:18,340 --> 01:53:19,820
Are you going to Melbourne, mate?

1633
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:30,120
I have like this, um...

1634
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:31,220
What's the word?

1635
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:32,640
What?

1636
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:33,740
No!

1637
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:36,640
Wrong for Robin, no!

1638
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:40,700
Imagine spending money on Gacha.

1639
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:41,840
Who would do such a thing?

1640
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:45,260
Also, what have you done while you were still alive to get
cursed with such luck?

1641
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:49,520
Well, actually, I'm kind of cursed.

1642
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:55,980
My ghost family were all kind of cursed, you know?

1643
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:59,400
Wait, making sure you can't see it all of a sudden.

1644
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:05,680
Basically, I have a curse upon my family.

1645
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:14,500
Not the sand.

1646
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:16,040
How did you know?

1647
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:19,700
How did you know it was a sand curse?

1648
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:22,020
How did you know that?

1649
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:26,200
How did you know?

1650
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:30,980
How did you know that?

1651
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:32,620
We're psychic?

1652
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:34,280
Sand curses are so common.

1653
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,180
Ah, I see, I see, I see, I see.

1654
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:37,180
I see.

1655
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:39,160
Classic curse trope.

1656
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:39,760
Ah!

1657
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:41,220
I see, I see.

1658
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:43,360
Yeah.

1659
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:46,860
I took a family vacation once.

1660
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:54,540
on that family vacation, my mom, she was told not to touch
the sand.

1661
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:56,100
And you know what she did?

1662
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:57,120
She brought it home.

1663
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:00,860
And ever since then, my family has been cursed.

1664
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:03,520
My, my ectoplasm line.

1665
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:07,860
I wonder if it counts as bloodline.

1666
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:09,940
I mean, I

1667
01:55:13,230 --> 01:55:13,650
don't know.

1668
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:15,270
Oh my gosh, Link, thank you for the hacka stuff.

1669
01:55:15,570 --> 01:55:17,370
Apologies for being an enabler.

1670
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:18,630
Oh my gosh.

1671
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:21,530
You guys.

1672
01:55:22,110 --> 01:55:23,610
Gacha's too scary on stream.

1673
01:55:23,790 --> 01:55:25,390
This is why I never do gacha on stream.

1674
01:55:25,930 --> 01:55:27,530
But I was like, it's Blue Archive.

1675
01:55:29,710 --> 01:55:29,970
Okay.

1676
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:34,030
Also, what does this mean?

1677
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:34,690
Is there a pity?

1678
01:55:35,290 --> 01:55:36,770
Oh, wow.

1679
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:38,770
That's a really high pity.

1680
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:39,950
Holy cow.

1681
01:55:42,690 --> 01:55:47,990
Return the sound, or suffer my curse.

1682
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:49,930
Oh, stop!

1683
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:52,830
Chironcha, please.

1684
01:55:53,150 --> 01:55:54,470
A wild Chiro appears.

1685
01:55:56,130 --> 01:55:58,210
Chiroko, come home.

1686
01:56:02,210 --> 01:56:03,490
I'm not gonna look.

1687
01:56:03,690 --> 01:56:04,290
I'm not gonna look.

1688
01:56:05,890 --> 01:56:06,990
Did I get it?

1689
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:08,190
Did I get it?

1690
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:09,810
I got it!

1691
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:10,410
Okay.

1692
01:56:12,210 --> 01:56:12,710
Oh!

1693
01:56:12,970 --> 01:56:13,070
Oh!

1694
01:56:13,650 --> 01:56:13,650
Oh!

1695
01:56:14,150 --> 01:56:14,230
Oh!

1696
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:14,430
Ah!

1697
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:25,910
You know what?

1698
01:56:27,290 --> 01:56:27,990
You know what?

1699
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:29,630
I'll take it!

1700
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:32,090
I'll take it!

1701
01:56:34,130 --> 01:56:35,070
Oh, we got more music!

1702
01:56:35,290 --> 01:56:37,650
Path to V- or not, we got any music.

1703
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:39,370
Normal dress.

1704
01:56:40,090 --> 01:56:41,650
A delicate fanzine.

1705
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:43,510
Diamonds.

1706
01:56:46,730 --> 01:56:47,450
Yippee!

1707
01:56:48,770 --> 01:56:49,290
Me.

1708
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:51,010
The desire sensor.

1709
01:56:51,930 --> 01:56:54,730
The Desire Sensor called it, you know?

1710
01:56:54,950 --> 01:56:56,390
I'm glad you got someone.

1711
01:56:56,730 --> 01:56:57,670
I know.

1712
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:04,740
When Desire Sensor was just like, Um, Mutsuki last.

1713
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:06,300
We'll have you change that.

1714
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:09,120
That, um, that perception.

1715
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:12,700
You can always keep pulling.

1716
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:14,200
I do kind of wanna.

1717
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:16,520
I wanna get at least Shiroko.

1718
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:19,320
Hold on, though.

1719
01:57:19,460 --> 01:57:20,360
Why do I go to my dorm?

1720
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:22,060
Ooh!

1721
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:31,340
That my body's going to be in that bag.

1722
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,460
Let's see.

1723
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:40,020
Did I get anything here?

1724
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:41,340
I got the music, though, right?

1725
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:43,740
We'll try that one.

1726
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:46,760
In the back, we got the Perro Rosa, mom.

1727
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:49,980
Double click to use her?

1728
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,460
Wait, didn't I...

1729
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:52,920
Did I not...

1730
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:53,920
Oh, thank you.

1731
01:57:58,700 --> 01:58:01,000
Um, I don't think we had anything else.

1732
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:02,140
Wee!

1733
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:05,980
I want to get different hands, too.

1734
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:08,660
You can listen to the music here.

1735
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:09,000
You can.

1736
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:13,880
Oh, there it is.

1737
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:25,810
I do, um...

1738
01:58:26,350 --> 01:58:28,110
Maybe play around to reset your luck.

1739
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:29,610
Good, good plan.

1740
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:30,910
Oh!

1741
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:35,840
Oh, yeah!

1742
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:36,160
Yeah!

1743
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:38,900
Look at that violin.

1744
01:58:41,540 --> 01:58:44,120
I can never tell the difference between a viola and a
violin.

1745
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:49,500
Oh wait, save?

1746
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:52,620
Why is it so quiet?

1747
01:58:57,610 --> 01:58:58,850
Viola is just deeper sounding?

1748
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:03,090
It's so quiet.

1749
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:21,030
Um...

1750
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:22,090
Uh...

1751
01:59:22,090 --> 01:59:41,130
You know what, okay, let's do, would a friendly match be the
one with the AI or...

1752
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:43,570
Wait, how do I play with the computers?

1753
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:49,990
Ah, show.

1754
01:59:51,230 --> 01:59:52,190
Create room?

1755
01:59:57,730 --> 01:59:58,070
Limited.

1756
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:03,190
Thinking time.

1757
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:04,910
I need a lot of thinking time.

1758
02:00:06,110 --> 02:00:07,310
Friendly create AI.

1759
02:00:07,670 --> 02:00:08,310
Oh, versus AI.

1760
02:00:08,490 --> 02:00:08,790
There we go.

1761
02:00:08,950 --> 02:00:09,750
Thank you guys.

1762
02:00:11,670 --> 02:00:12,890
It's so quiet.

1763
02:00:14,730 --> 02:00:15,970
It's so quiet.

1764
02:00:16,190 --> 02:00:17,470
Okay, so this is my first game.

1765
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:18,610
We're gonna play with the AI.

1766
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:23,460
What?

1767
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:26,480
Where's the music?

1768
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:28,720
Oh, thank goodness.

1769
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:33,540
Oh, oh, um, okay.

1770
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:33,920
Let's see.

1771
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:36,400
We could get four, five, six.

1772
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:38,940
Oh, gosh.

1773
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:44,340
Oh, hold on.

1774
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:45,680
We have five, six, seven.

1775
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:48,120
Yeah.

1776
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:49,920
Three, four.

1777
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:51,880
We have a pair.

1778
02:00:53,160 --> 02:00:54,920
Okay, I'm tossing this.

1779
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:05,700
Oh, this is so stressful now.

1780
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:14,300
Um, we don't want these two those and it seems like we're
going for the for the Simples one, right?

1781
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:16,400
Maybe maybe Simples would be easiest.

1782
02:01:16,780 --> 02:01:23,800
So get rid of you Dang They're just getting rid of those.

1783
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:24,360
Ah

1784
02:01:37,610 --> 02:01:39,050

02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:46,940
Okay.

Now we have...

1787
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:52,900
Maybe I get rid of one of the five...

1788
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:53,080

1789
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:54,500

I get rid of the five.

1791
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:56,480
So we have five, six, seven.

1792
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:57,920
Maybe.

1793
02:01:59,060 --> 02:01:59,420

02:09:16,050 --> 02:09:17,930
I could get the triplet.

1885
02:09:19,390 --> 02:09:21,710
But I can still also get triplet of four.

1886
02:09:25,050 --> 02:09:26,030

02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:30,840

Oh, wait.

1909
02:10:39,490 --> 02:10:41,090
We ended up getting the nine anyway.

1910
02:10:41,530 --> 02:10:42,170
That's so funny.

1911
02:10:50,170 --> 02:10:50,730
But...

1912
02:10:52,530 --> 02:10:54,970
Can you move over to the... Oh, yeah, yeah.

1913
02:10:55,050 --> 02:10:55,490
Give me a second.

1914
02:10:55,970 --> 02:10:56,590
Can I pause?

1915
02:10:57,350 --> 02:10:59,650
Yeah, I'll move over a little bit so you can't use conceal.

1916
02:11:01,170 --> 02:11:02,110
There you go.

1917
02:11:02,650 --> 02:11:03,270
Oh, not that.

1918
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:08,140
There you go.

1919
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:09,560
It's not paused?

1920
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:16,300
Oh, oh, oh, ah!

1921
02:11:17,740 --> 02:11:20,160
Um, oh, oh, oh, oh, you can't pause?

1922
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:21,920
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

1923
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:23,080
8p.

1924
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:25,340
Thank you, guys.

1925
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:26,460
I don't know what I would do without you.

1926
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:28,220
I am trying to think for myself.

1927
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:28,920
Goodbye.

1928
02:11:31,620 --> 02:11:34,380
I'm not trying to rely on you guys too much, but also
goodbye.

1929
02:11:36,160 --> 02:11:38,580
Dang, that would have maybe been kind of good though.

1930
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:42,200
Wait, why is it red?

1931
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:43,620
Why is it different?

1932
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:47,460
You got this.

1933
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:48,200
T-A!

1934
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:50,620
T-A, I'm scared.

1935
02:11:54,060 --> 02:11:54,420
Dora?

1936
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:56,680
Wait, what's the Dora?

1937
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:57,780
Hold on, I need my notes.

1938
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:04,400
Oh, it is shining.

1939
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:05,500
It is shining.

1940
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:08,540
So keep.

1941
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:12,640
Maybe get rid of the six?

1942
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:14,920
Or...

1943
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:16,260
Nine months?

1944
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:18,520
Six or nine months?

1945
02:12:18,700 --> 02:12:20,960
We'll get rid of the nine months.

1946
02:12:22,700 --> 02:12:24,340
Why did I get six?

1947
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:25,360
I said six earlier.

1948
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:25,960
I'm going to commit.

1949
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:26,560
I'm going to commit.

1950
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:27,480
I'm going to commit to the bit.

1951
02:12:35,630 --> 02:12:37,230
Oh, we don't need goodbye.

1952
02:12:40,630 --> 02:12:42,650
What am I pawning for?

1953
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:44,150
Uh...

1954
02:12:44,150 --> 02:12:44,430
Oh!

1955
02:12:45,090 --> 02:12:45,470
Wait.

1956
02:12:46,130 --> 02:12:47,590
Wait, should I for the 8?

1957
02:12:48,130 --> 02:12:49,330
So we can get the triple?

1958
02:12:50,670 --> 02:12:51,010
Wait.

1959
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:52,290
Skip, really?

1960
02:12:53,650 --> 02:12:54,030
Eh?

1961
02:12:54,690 --> 02:12:56,050
Never be pawned.

1962
02:12:56,650 --> 02:12:57,490
Seven pairs.

1963
02:12:58,410 --> 02:12:59,050
Wait, I...

1964
02:13:00,790 --> 02:13:01,390
Skip?

1965
02:13:01,930 --> 02:13:02,730
Okay, I'll skip.

1966
02:13:04,370 --> 02:13:05,870
I trust you guys.

1967
02:13:06,210 --> 02:13:07,590
We're going for seven pairs.

1968
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:09,430
I trust you, Chie.

1969
02:13:09,630 --> 02:13:10,870
I skip, I trust you.

1970
02:13:12,430 --> 02:13:14,930
Anything Chie says, Chie is God.

1971
02:13:30,220 --> 02:13:30,620
GG.

1972
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:40,280
General rule of thumb for your first discards is
non-Yaku-Hai wins first, then isolated ones, and nines, then

1973
02:13:40,280 --> 02:13:40,900
Yaku-Hai.

1974
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:44,300
If you have a pair of any of the above, you should usually
keep it.

1975
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:45,140
Whoa!

1976
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:46,960
We have two Easts!

1977
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:48,100
Whoa!

1978
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:49,400

I don't really need this either I will drop three so the
nine pin six or nine pin I could drop either of them yeah

1983
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:45,260
we'll drop the nine pin

1984
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:58,100
we'll keep a five pin right we have pair here

1985
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:18,340
this sick is good for sequence maybe okay let's get one of

the ap really okay well I could get six seven eight I have

1987
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:50,130

help okay

1988
02:15:55,460 --> 02:16:08,860
skip four oh we have a sequence of four five six okay okay a
seven would make five six we have four five six though so i

1989
02:16:08,860 --> 02:16:17,780
can draw the or i can wait we have one two uh we can drop
either one of these then right so let's drop the let's drop

1990
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:22,980

Thank you, thank you!

02:16:43,890 --> 02:16:44,790
Wait, drop the 8?

1994
02:16:45,690 --> 02:16:47,730
I guess because we already have other pairs.

1995
02:16:48,370 --> 02:16:49,770
And this will make a triple?

1996
02:16:50,330 --> 02:16:50,530
Okay.

1997
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:51,690
Or a sequence, I mean.

1998
02:16:55,330 --> 02:16:55,810
North.

1999
02:16:56,410 --> 02:16:57,090
Go away.

2000
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:10,580
Uh, we don't need it.

2001
02:17:13,910 --> 02:17:15,770
Let's get rid of the 7s.

2002
02:17:19,530 --> 02:17:19,810
Yeah.

2003
02:17:20,970 --> 02:17:21,450
Toss.

2004
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:27,430
Come on!

2005
02:17:33,450 --> 02:17:33,970
Toss.

2006
02:17:36,310 --> 02:17:36,550
Oh what?

2007
02:17:36,570 --> 02:17:37,530
Keep it?

2008
02:17:38,210 --> 02:17:42,530
Oh what?

2009
02:17:42,530 --> 02:17:42,650
Oh what?

2010
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:44,990
My bad.

2011
02:17:48,130 --> 02:17:52,750
Why would I, why should I, um, why should I have kept it?

2012
02:17:52,970 --> 02:17:53,710
Just so I know.

2013
02:17:56,890 --> 02:17:58,030
Makes one three five.

2014
02:17:58,050 --> 02:17:58,890
you can finish.

2015
02:17:59,530 --> 02:18:00,970
Wait, one three five is a thing?

2016
02:18:03,630 --> 02:18:04,810
One three five shape is good.

2017
02:18:05,290 --> 02:18:07,550
Ah, the two does nothing.

2018
02:18:07,890 --> 02:18:09,290
Because two is more useless right now.

2019
02:18:10,250 --> 02:18:12,110
Oh, one three five can be good.

2020
02:18:12,250 --> 02:18:14,190
Ah, I see, I see, I see, I see.

2021
02:18:15,350 --> 02:18:16,030
I see, I see.

2022
02:18:18,650 --> 02:18:20,290
You have fives.

2023
02:18:20,650 --> 02:18:22,790
Wait, all fives have a red version two for more points.

2024
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:25,010
Oh, I see, I see.

2025
02:18:30,990 --> 02:18:32,490
Oh, we got another 8.

2026
02:18:34,250 --> 02:18:36,170
But, um, we don't need it then, right?

2027
02:18:39,490 --> 02:18:41,150
So, beginner game.

2028
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:44,410
Yeah, who has the East?

2029
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:47,070
Give me the other Easts.

2030
02:18:55,140 --> 02:18:57,700
So, I think I had the 8 before.

2031
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:58,060
Oh!

2032
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:00,340
So, I should pawn here.

2033
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:02,660
I should pawn for the East.

2034
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:29,700
right pawn I pawn I pawn for oh and I discard maybe the two
the two pin yes okay I knew okay Oh wait uh-oh

2035
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:49,320
this one I need the two is that what it's showing that's
what oh my god no you

2036
02:19:53,860 --> 02:20:01,400

such a good hand too and the AI bested me

2037
02:20:06,980 --> 02:20:14,900
it's even stop saying AI easy it's making me so sad The AI
is sentient.

2038
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:19,420
You're good, you didn't feed.

2039
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:22,800
Itihime experience.

02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:25,920
No, I did get second though, I did get second.

2041
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:27,580
I didn't lose entirely.

2042
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:31,160
Let's try...

2043
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:33,620
I mean, just like with my gotcha.

2044
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:36,380
The AIs have gotten crazier, to be honest.

2045
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:37,680
I believe you, Tye.

2046
02:20:42,410 --> 02:20:43,870
It's just like with my gotcha.

2047
02:20:44,490 --> 02:20:57,470
entirely I still got someone let me see something real quick

No money for travel.

2053
02:21:58,630 --> 02:21:59,990
Miles for gotcha.

2054
02:22:01,990 --> 02:22:04,090
I don't know when we get the Patreon money.

2055
02:22:06,770 --> 02:22:09,150
I don't know, actually, when that happens.

2056
02:22:11,370 --> 02:22:12,250
Looking good with them glasses.

2057
02:22:12,430 --> 02:22:12,890
Very cute.

2058
02:22:13,230 --> 02:22:14,450
Oh, really?

2059
02:22:14,850 --> 02:22:15,710
Do you like the glasses?

2060
02:22:16,610 --> 02:22:18,350
I don't really like this style, though.

2061
02:22:18,630 --> 02:22:19,870
Maybe like around glasses.

2062
02:22:24,490 --> 02:22:25,590
I'm so proud of you, Minda.

2063
02:22:25,730 --> 02:22:26,810
I was so happy to see the whole...

2064
02:22:26,810 --> 02:22:27,410
HENYA collab!

2065
02:22:27,790 --> 02:22:28,390
You're so cute!

Wow, okay.

2071
02:22:44,730 --> 02:22:47,370
Big round glasses with a swirly pattern on the lens.

2072
02:22:48,590 --> 02:22:50,210
Hey, that's really nerd, then.

2073
02:22:50,290 --> 02:22:52,230
That's really nerdy glasses, then.

2074
02:22:54,930 --> 02:22:58,650
Yeah, I'm so glad that I could collab with HENYA 2.

2075
02:23:01,370 --> 02:23:04,090
I actually have been thinking so much about Hell Divers.

2076
02:23:04,310 --> 02:23:06,250
It was a lot of fun, so...

2077
02:23:07,410 --> 02:23:08,430
It was so much fun.

2078
02:23:10,030 --> 02:23:10,910
Okay, just...

2079
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:13,250
This is a little bit more.

2080
02:23:15,530 --> 02:23:16,410
Just like...

2081
02:23:16,410 --> 02:23:19,810
I'll do two more, two more, two more, two more, two more,
two more.

2082
02:23:23,090 --> 02:23:24,590
Not tumor, two more.

2083
02:23:28,660 --> 02:23:30,460
Wait, how much do I have to get?

2084
02:23:35,050 --> 02:23:38,750
18 wait 18 18 18

2085
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:58,190
maybe if I do like that

2086
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:08,280
that's 24 how much do I need 30 3600

2087
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:15,760
I could just do these two and then it'll be fine

2088
02:24:19,480 --> 02:24:20,660
Yeah, 36.

2089
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:23,860
By the way, Oshi Fun.

2090
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:24,840
No!

2091
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:27,120
Thank you, though.

2092
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:27,780
Thank you.

2093
02:24:29,860 --> 02:24:31,500
But, I'll do these two.

2094
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:33,840
I'm not going for the pity.

2095
02:24:37,650 --> 02:24:38,250
But I'm really...

2096
02:24:38,250 --> 02:24:38,790
I am...

2097
02:24:38,790 --> 02:24:40,390
I've been wanting to learn...

2098
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:43,410
Oh my goodness.

2099
02:24:43,630 --> 02:24:45,430
I've been wanting to learn Majong for so long.

2100
02:24:45,950 --> 02:24:46,850
I'm serious.

2101
02:24:50,050 --> 02:24:52,530
I want to have characters that I like to play with.

2102
02:24:53,690 --> 02:24:54,550
Characters that I like.

2103
02:24:56,490 --> 02:24:57,770
To go with, you know what I mean?

2104
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:01,470
Hey.

2105
02:25:03,590 --> 02:25:04,490
What character do I want?

2106
02:25:04,550 --> 02:25:05,270
I want Shiroko!

2107
02:25:06,790 --> 02:25:07,590
I want Shiroko.

2108
02:25:08,670 --> 02:25:10,890
Okay, this one, I'm getting the other one.

2109
02:25:11,170 --> 02:25:11,830
And then that's it.

2110
02:25:11,870 --> 02:25:12,110
That's it.

2111
02:25:12,190 --> 02:25:12,470
That's it.

2112
02:25:12,590 --> 02:25:12,870
That's it.

2113
02:25:13,010 --> 02:25:14,430
I'm not crazy.

2114
02:25:14,950 --> 02:25:15,630
I'm not crazy.

2115
02:25:21,340 --> 02:25:22,280
Something, something.

2116
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:30,900
On stream content, something, something.

2117
02:25:36,500 --> 02:25:37,480
Kayoko, please.

2118
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:38,760
She's not in the game!

2119
02:25:43,430 --> 02:25:48,010
It's only Aru, Mutsuki, Shiroko, and Hoshino.

2120
02:25:50,350 --> 02:25:51,830
I have a poll and another gotcha later.

2121
02:25:51,910 --> 02:25:53,370
Please soak my common polls.

2122
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:56,310
for you, Daniel.

2123
02:26:00,230 --> 02:26:00,730
Summon.

2124
02:26:01,890 --> 02:26:02,390
Shiroko.

2125
02:26:02,790 --> 02:26:04,910
No, I don't really want Shiroko that much.

2126
02:26:05,050 --> 02:26:05,330
You know what?

2127
02:26:05,370 --> 02:26:07,290
I don't really... I don't really care.

2128
02:26:08,610 --> 02:26:09,610
You know...

2129
02:26:09,610 --> 02:26:10,370
Whatever.

2130
02:26:10,890 --> 02:26:13,010
I feel like I've learned so much this stream, though.

2131
02:26:13,170 --> 02:26:13,890
Truly, truly.

2132
02:26:14,470 --> 02:26:16,250
Thank you guys so much for helping me out.

2133
02:26:17,450 --> 02:26:19,650
Mint, do you play Blue Archive every day?

2134
02:26:20,410 --> 02:26:23,230
I play Blue Archive every day.

2135
02:26:25,030 --> 02:26:33,310

02:26:33,310 --> 02:26:41,490

2137
02:26:45,930 --> 02:26:52,550
dream the other night where you turn into a fruit
fortunately it was just a figment of my imagination

2138
02:26:59,470 --> 02:27:00,270
What a cat paw!

2139
02:27:01,130 --> 02:27:01,990
I got more shit'em.

2140
02:27:02,230 --> 02:27:04,010
That's actually my whole poll is a shit'em.

2141
02:27:05,650 --> 02:27:06,570
Thank you, game.

2142
02:27:13,070 --> 02:27:14,350
We got the cat paw though.

2143
02:27:14,990 --> 02:27:17,230
I am excited about that.

2144
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:20,090
Alexa play unravel.

2145
02:27:21,150 --> 02:27:28,190
Oh no, something, something.

2146
02:27:31,170 --> 02:27:32,110
Did I get it?

2147
02:27:33,170 --> 02:27:33,990
Did I get it?

2148
02:27:35,250 --> 02:27:36,410
Did I get it?

2149
02:27:45,100 --> 02:27:45,860
Heart of the ocean?

2150
02:28:01,550 --> 02:28:06,710
Oh, my gosh.

2151
02:28:07,050 --> 02:28:10,550
It's so funny, too, because recently I was just like, man, I
really want to cosplay Hoshino.

2152
02:28:12,790 --> 02:28:15,130
This is so perfect!

2153
02:28:15,610 --> 02:28:16,750
Who sent that earlier?

2154
02:28:17,010 --> 02:28:18,110
Who sent that earlier?

2155
02:28:18,510 --> 02:28:19,560
That's super chat.

2156
02:28:23,470 --> 02:28:25,430
Where are you?

2157
02:28:27,750 --> 02:28:28,650
You...

2158
02:28:28,650 --> 02:28:30,090
It was me!

2159
02:28:30,270 --> 02:28:30,770
Grump!

2160
02:28:31,950 --> 02:28:33,450
Grump, you did it!

2161
02:28:33,470 --> 02:28:34,950
You saved my poll!

2162
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:38,450
You saved it!

2163
02:28:39,730 --> 02:28:40,990
Oh my gosh.

2164
02:28:41,610 --> 02:28:42,770
Thank you for the thank you.

2165
02:28:42,790 --> 02:28:43,650
Thank you!

2166
02:28:45,870 --> 02:28:48,550
Oh my gosh, Grumpy, we're in my lucky time!

2167
02:28:51,030 --> 02:28:56,250
You really did it, you manifested it.

2168
02:29:05,950 --> 02:29:07,170
Now single poles?

2169
02:29:07,430 --> 02:29:09,090
Oh, I do have enough for single poles, don't I?

2170
02:29:09,430 --> 02:29:10,770
I always forget that's an option.

2171
02:29:12,810 --> 02:29:15,110
It's always go big or go home, you know?

2172
02:29:15,330 --> 02:29:16,390
We do have a couple, though.

2173
02:29:17,630 --> 02:29:18,790
Go to shirt icon.

2174
02:29:19,470 --> 02:29:21,770
Oh, that's where we can buy the other things, right?

2175
02:29:22,210 --> 02:29:23,110
The other skins.

2176
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:26,030
Oh, there's more!

2177
02:29:26,770 --> 02:29:27,670
The bond!

2178
02:29:30,710 --> 02:29:31,190
Gift.

2179
02:29:33,250 --> 02:29:34,230
What's a good one?

2180
02:29:34,650 --> 02:29:36,790
So if I do like this one...

2181
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,220
She's sleeping on a whale.

2182
02:29:48,940 --> 02:29:49,420
Beeching.

2183
02:29:51,940 --> 02:29:53,660
So cute.

2184
02:29:54,460 --> 02:29:56,740
I like the way.

2185
02:29:57,300 --> 02:29:58,900
I like the way.

2186
02:29:58,900 --> 02:29:59,620
I like the way.

2187
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:00,540
Oh.

2188
02:30:02,740 --> 02:30:03,180
It's more.

2189
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:06,340
I like the way.

2190
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:11,280
I'm Abidos, Koto School School.

2191
02:30:12,840 --> 02:30:16,180
I've noticed that I came here, but...

2192
02:30:16,180 --> 02:30:17,420
Well, I can just do it.

2193
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:18,540
No.

2194
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:19,100
No.

2195
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:21,380
She's so cute.

2196
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:32,140
It's so cute.

2197
02:30:39,340 --> 02:30:41,340
She's such an Oji-san.

2198
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:45,440
Oh, you look good.

2199
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:49,420
This is...

2200
02:30:50,220 --> 02:30:51,380
Robbing a kan?

2201
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:52,760
Under the sea.

2202
02:30:53,740 --> 02:30:54,300
Under the river.

2203
02:30:55,100 --> 02:30:55,940
What are all of...

2204
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:57,700
There's so many lines.

2205
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:02,280
PewTuber owned a whole stock.

2206
02:31:03,480 --> 02:31:05,200
I lucksacked Mutski the other day.

2207
02:31:05,480 --> 02:31:07,720
Hope you get everyone you want from this banner.

2208
02:31:09,220 --> 02:31:09,620
Oh my gosh.

2209
02:31:09,700 --> 02:31:10,460
Thank you for this.

2210
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:11,700
Very, very spooky.

2211
02:31:11,860 --> 02:31:12,360
Akadono.

2212
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:13,740
Thank you.

2213
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:16,260
Quadruple floors.

2214
02:31:16,500 --> 02:31:17,720
So spooky, spooky, spooky.

2215
02:31:19,420 --> 02:31:21,420
Oh my gosh, look how many there...

2216
02:31:22,180 --> 02:31:23,400
My brain is starting...

2217
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:24,280
Wait, Bai Man?

2218
02:31:24,700 --> 02:31:25,500
San Bai Man?

2219
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:29,060
Honey Man Man Gan?

2220
02:31:29,320 --> 02:31:30,320
What is going on?

2221
02:31:32,600 --> 02:31:33,800
There's so much!

2222
02:31:34,900 --> 02:31:35,860
There's so...

2223
02:31:35,860 --> 02:31:36,900
Holy cow!

2224
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:38,620
How many voice lines are there?

2225
02:31:40,680 --> 02:31:42,320
Check the Yaku list, please?

2226
02:31:42,460 --> 02:31:43,340
How do I find that?

2227
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:50,560
Look at that!

2228
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:51,260
So cute!

2229
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:52,840
So cute, so cute!

2230
02:31:53,860 --> 02:32:03,750
Me too.

2231
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:10,700
Hold on, throw this over here real quick.

2232
02:32:16,800 --> 02:32:18,180
How tall is...

2233
02:32:18,180 --> 02:32:20,120
How tall is Hoshi here?

2234
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:21,700
Oh, I...

2235
02:32:24,500 --> 02:32:26,540
I'm too tall right now.

2236
02:32:27,660 --> 02:32:28,360
How tall is she?

2237
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:31,720
Bring back the glasses.

2238
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:47,800
Hold on.

2239
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:48,520
Almost the same high.

2240
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:49,480
145.

2241
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:50,400
Oh, I'm a little taller.

2242
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:52,500
So this should be kind of accurate, right?

2243
02:32:55,560 --> 02:32:57,080
Wait, wait, hold on.

2244
02:32:57,680 --> 02:33:00,740
How do I do it?

2245
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:01,360
Hold on.

2246
02:33:05,360 --> 02:33:06,240
Hold on.

2247
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:06,420
Hold on.

2248
02:33:06,860 --> 02:33:07,200
Hold on.

2249
02:33:07,620 --> 02:33:08,880
How do I?

2250
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:11,660
There's like a way that I can move my legs.

2251
02:33:12,660 --> 02:33:12,960
Oh.

2252
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:14,820
Oh, no, I made myself smaller.

2253
02:33:15,320 --> 02:33:16,120
Too small.

2254
02:33:17,240 --> 02:33:18,420
Like here, right?

2255
02:33:19,180 --> 02:33:20,300
Chicken wing arms?

2256
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:21,640
What are you talking about?

2257
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:24,540
What are you talking about?

2258
02:33:24,620 --> 02:33:26,240
I can jump you guys, did you know that?

2259
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:26,600
Boink!

2260
02:33:31,100 --> 02:33:31,500
Boink!

2261
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:31,880
Boink!

2262
02:33:37,430 --> 02:33:37,830
Hooray!

2263
02:33:39,070 --> 02:33:39,470
I

2264
02:33:48,620 --> 02:33:49,980
think that's because I'm a ghost, you guys.

2265
02:33:50,200 --> 02:33:52,300
Here, let's do one arm up, one arm down, though.

2266
02:33:53,400 --> 02:33:54,380
Kind of like...

2267
02:33:54,380 --> 02:33:55,720
Wait, I want to be opposite of her.

2268
02:33:57,940 --> 02:33:58,340
Cheese!

2269
02:33:59,420 --> 02:33:59,820
Cheese!

2270
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:00,560
Cheese!

2271
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:01,520
Cheese!

2272
02:34:04,620 --> 02:34:06,840
Wait, I have to be kind of a sleepy face too.

2273
02:34:19,820 --> 02:34:21,080
What was that?

2274
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:23,060
Oh, no, not the sticky keys.

2275
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:25,080
That scared me.

2276
02:34:26,400 --> 02:34:27,120
Thank you!

2277
02:34:27,580 --> 02:34:28,440
Jump, ghost girl.

2278
02:34:28,620 --> 02:34:28,800
Jump!

2279
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:31,080
Jump like your life defends on it!

2280
02:34:33,160 --> 02:34:35,720
Give me ten more jumping jacks!

2281
02:34:36,020 --> 02:34:36,620
Yes, sir!

2282
02:34:37,060 --> 02:34:37,900
Yes, sir!

2283
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:38,400
Wait.

2284
02:34:39,320 --> 02:34:39,840
Oh!

2285
02:34:43,700 --> 02:34:44,900
Yes, sir!

2286
02:34:46,460 --> 02:34:51,000
One, two, three, four!

2287
02:35:01,980 --> 02:35:04,500
She's doing it, she's doing it.

2288
02:35:06,960 --> 02:35:08,120
Oh, wait, I can beat, hold on.

2289
02:35:08,540 --> 02:35:09,300
You know what I'm gonna beat?

2290
02:35:09,880 --> 02:35:12,060
I'm gonna be the spooky ghost haunting.

2291
02:35:12,180 --> 02:35:12,660
Oh, Shino.

2292
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:13,880
Oh, Shino.

2293
02:35:14,940 --> 02:35:16,720
Why is my gacha look so bad?

2294
02:35:16,820 --> 02:35:17,260
Oh, Shino.

2295
02:35:18,140 --> 02:35:19,460
I wanted Shiroko.

2296
02:35:19,460 --> 02:35:21,380
I even wore her halo.

2297
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:24,080
Oh, she know.

2298
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:27,380
Oh, she know.

2299
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:29,880
Oh, she know.

2300
02:35:38,190 --> 02:35:38,470
Ooh.

2301
02:35:38,470 --> 02:35:39,190
You killed her.

2302
02:35:39,870 --> 02:35:40,010
Nope.

2303
02:35:41,270 --> 02:35:42,870
I didn't kill anybody.

2304
02:35:46,770 --> 02:35:48,710
They're in my leg, you sticking out.

2305
02:35:48,990 --> 02:35:49,110
Ta-da.

2306
02:35:50,190 --> 02:35:50,630
Ta-da.

2307
02:35:51,970 --> 02:35:52,930
Ta-da-da.

2308
02:35:53,090 --> 02:35:53,230
Ta-da-da.

2309
02:35:56,250 --> 02:35:58,670
Now we're Facing the same way.

2310
02:36:00,070 --> 02:36:00,530
Yeah.

2311
02:36:05,270 --> 02:36:07,730
Well, you do have her Halo, so she might be dead.

2312
02:36:09,390 --> 02:36:09,850
No.

2313
02:36:12,250 --> 02:36:13,830
She's literally sleeping.

2314
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:18,680
How do I go back?

2315
02:36:19,140 --> 02:36:19,160
Meow.

2316
02:36:20,780 --> 02:36:21,140
Meow.

2317
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:28,900
There we go.

2318
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:29,840
That was fun.

2319
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:31,280
Little photo shoot time, right?

2320
02:36:32,740 --> 02:36:34,020
Little photo shoot time.

Click the question mark.

2326
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:16,950
Ah, here we go.

2327
02:37:18,590 --> 02:37:22,970
Yeah, someone asked me about the looking at the Yakus
earlier.

2328
02:37:23,590 --> 02:37:29,270
All symbols, fully concealed hand, man, men, men, men, men
only.

2329
02:37:32,190 --> 02:37:34,030
Win a hand by sumo.

2330
02:37:34,650 --> 02:37:36,090
Drawing the winning tile at...

2331
02:37:36,670 --> 02:37:38,930
Men's engine closed hand.

2332
02:37:44,530 --> 02:37:45,870
Seat wind.

2333
02:37:46,830 --> 02:37:48,770
Oh my gosh.

2334
02:37:57,690 --> 02:37:58,030
Oh!

2335
02:38:01,180 --> 02:38:05,620
1-2-3-2-3-4, 3-4-5, 6-6-6, 9-9?

2336
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:10,100
This looks impossible.

2337
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:13,340
A full flush.

2338
02:38:13,940 --> 02:38:15,020
Holy cow.

2339
02:38:26,820 --> 02:38:29,580
This seems like something I'm gonna have to really study.

2340
02:38:30,620 --> 02:38:31,800
Blessing of heaven, blessing of earth.

2341
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:33,000
Big three dragons.

2342
02:38:33,820 --> 02:38:34,200
Wow.

2343
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:37,260
Easier than you think, really?

2344
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:41,840
Four concealed triplets.

2345
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:43,660
What is a men's engine?

2346
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:47,700
Green dragon is not necessary.

2347
02:38:48,120 --> 02:38:50,040
Green dragon is necessary in my heart.

2348
02:38:54,570 --> 02:38:55,390
A closed hand.

2349
02:38:58,530 --> 02:38:59,790
Oh, welcome to my bishop.

2350
02:38:59,950 --> 02:39:00,510
Thank you!

2351
02:39:02,210 --> 02:39:03,630
Closed hand, no calls.

2352
02:39:10,940 --> 02:39:14,080
These were all the ones that, like, had the different voice
lines.

2353
02:39:18,180 --> 02:39:19,800
Thank you again for the vibe gifted.

2354
02:39:20,100 --> 02:39:20,440
Thank you.

2355
02:39:21,260 --> 02:39:22,680
13 orphans is a myth.

2356
02:39:23,060 --> 02:39:23,980
What would that be under?

2357
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:27,680
Oh, there it is.

2358
02:39:28,460 --> 02:39:35,120
Win a hand with one of each 13 terminal tiles plus any tile
matches one of them.

2359
02:39:35,220 --> 02:39:35,340
Wait.

2360
02:39:35,440 --> 02:39:36,440
Win a...

2361
02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:41,400
Win a hand with one of each 13 terminal tiles.

2362
02:39:41,440 --> 02:39:41,780
Oh!

2363
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:44,180
Plus any tile matches one of them.

2364
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:46,280
Oh!

2365
02:39:49,440 --> 02:39:51,100
So it's like opposite.

2366
02:39:51,580 --> 02:39:53,960
It's the exact opposite of the...

2367
02:39:55,380 --> 02:39:56,820
of the simple one.

2368
02:39:57,480 --> 02:39:58,300
Because you have to get...

2369
02:39:58,300 --> 02:39:59,860
You can only get one's nines.

2370
02:40:00,860 --> 02:40:02,860
And then the...

2371
02:40:04,780 --> 02:40:05,420
The...

2372
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:09,380
the honorific ones, right?

2373
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:14,860
What does it mean plus any tile matches one of them?

2374
02:40:15,340 --> 02:40:16,060
What does that mean?

2375
02:40:24,260 --> 02:40:25,000
It's the pair.

2376
02:40:28,040 --> 02:40:29,740
Oh, the nine pair here.

2377
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:31,960
Ah, I see, I see.

2378
02:40:32,940 --> 02:40:33,680
Ah, okay, okay.

2379
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,020
So, but it's any tile matches one of them.

2380
02:40:36,100 --> 02:40:40,420
So if it's like, if I have two, two Wests, it would be fine.

2381
02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:45,960
Still any pair of anyone.

2382
02:40:47,080 --> 02:40:47,800
Just one pair.

2383
02:40:48,840 --> 02:40:49,420
Not all done.

2384
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:49,880
Not all done.

2385
02:40:50,380 --> 02:40:50,880
Oh my gosh.

2386
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:52,840
I feel like I learned so much today.

2387
02:40:53,560 --> 02:40:54,200
Oh my god.

2388
02:40:54,400 --> 02:40:56,640
I feel like I actually learned so, so much.

2389
02:40:57,980 --> 02:41:04,100
Like I feel like maybe I couldn't win any game, but I could
at least know a little bit of what I'm doing.

2390
02:41:04,780 --> 02:41:06,060
I learned so much.

2391
02:41:06,540 --> 02:41:07,160
For real.

2392
02:41:08,560 --> 02:41:09,880
I feel like I could...

2393
02:41:09,880 --> 02:41:12,880
Now I'm going to watch Saki and I'm going to be like...

2394
02:41:13,340 --> 02:41:21,320
in with knowledge that I already know so the power of blue

I have a couple friends that are really into Akagi, so...

2399
02:41:52,660 --> 02:41:53,460
Thank you!

2400
02:41:54,180 --> 02:41:55,840
I think I know a little bit more about Majang now.

2401
02:41:55,960 --> 02:41:57,920
Thanks for the stream, by the way, Arona or Plana?

2402
02:42:01,400 --> 02:42:02,380
I think Arona.

2403
02:42:04,300 --> 02:42:05,620
I think Arona for me.

2404
02:42:05,740 --> 02:42:06,620
She's more my type.

2405
02:42:07,180 --> 02:42:09,020
She's very, like...

2406
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:10,580
Like, very Rem-esque.

2407
02:42:10,880 --> 02:42:13,840
You know, and I love Rem for...

2408
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:17,280
I mean, I love Rem for everything, but, like, her...

2409
02:42:17,300 --> 02:42:18,840
Her looks are just so cute.

2410
02:42:21,440 --> 02:42:22,860
But I love Plana, too.

2411
02:42:23,940 --> 02:42:25,840
Plana would never give blue albums.

2412
02:42:27,380 --> 02:42:28,560
It's fun watching you learn my song.

2413
02:42:28,660 --> 02:42:29,120
Thanks for the stream.

2414
02:42:29,260 --> 02:42:29,940
Thank you, guys.

2415
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:30,820
Thank you.

2416
02:42:35,020 --> 02:42:37,450
Thank you.

2417
02:42:37,870 --> 02:42:38,350
Hoops.

2418
02:42:38,750 --> 02:42:38,890
Ah-ha.

2419
02:42:39,430 --> 02:42:40,270
Ho-ho-ho.

2420
02:42:43,510 --> 02:42:45,690
How do you feel about Shiroko Terror?

2421
02:42:47,010 --> 02:42:48,750
I like her, but I like normal Shiroko.

2422
02:42:48,770 --> 02:42:49,170
more.

2423
02:42:51,210 --> 02:42:51,730
Fresh joke.

2424
02:42:52,390 --> 02:42:53,130
Very fresh.

2425
02:42:54,410 --> 02:42:56,230
There's Majang in nearly every Yakuza game.

2426
02:42:56,410 --> 02:43:00,790
Oh, then I need to study even more for whenever I play, for
whenever I play.

2427
02:43:01,350 --> 02:43:01,910
Yakuza.

2428
02:43:03,230 --> 02:43:03,730
Arona.

2429
02:43:04,270 --> 02:43:05,490
All blues won gold.

2430
02:43:06,250 --> 02:43:08,810
Stop showing my actual polls.

2431
02:43:09,370 --> 02:43:10,110
Who's Rem?

2432
02:43:12,150 --> 02:43:14,610
Have you read volume final?

2433
02:43:14,750 --> 02:43:15,150
I have.

2434
02:43:15,290 --> 02:43:15,750
I have.

2435
02:43:17,090 --> 02:43:17,830
Yes, yes.

2436
02:43:18,770 --> 02:43:21,450
Will you be streaming your future Blue Archive polls?

2437
02:43:22,730 --> 02:43:28,230
Probably not because I play Blue Archive on my actual phone.

2438
02:43:29,890 --> 02:43:31,990
I think I would feel a little naked.

2439
02:43:32,430 --> 02:43:38,010
I would feel a little too nervous because it's my actual
phone phone, you know?

2440
02:43:38,510 --> 02:43:42,250
Like, it's, I don't know.

2441
02:43:42,950 --> 02:43:47,010
It would make me feel like, oh my gosh.

2442
02:43:47,170 --> 02:43:48,750
What if I accidentally, like, close?

2443
02:43:48,770 --> 02:43:56,730
out then you guys can see everything that's on my well not
that I have I don't really have anything on my home screen

2444
02:43:56,730 --> 02:44:08,330
that would be bad I have all my gotcha games which are in a
folder called hell hitting Mike Tyson's ass Wow thank you

Everything should be good.

2469
02:46:05,080 --> 02:46:08,020
I'm going to censor out a couple things real quick.

2470
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:09,720
Skip.

2471
02:46:19,710 --> 02:46:20,210
Oh, wait.

2472
02:46:20,730 --> 02:46:21,110
There we go.

02:46:22,130 --> 02:46:22,730
Actually, it's okay.

2474
02:46:23,270 --> 02:46:24,010
Because I'm just on Wi-Fi.

02:46:27,550 --> 02:46:29,530
Let me send this to myself.

2477
02:46:36,720 --> 02:46:37,760
How do I send this to my...

2478
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:38,060
Oh, here.

2479
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:41,440
I'm proud of it.

2480
02:46:41,460 --> 02:46:42,340
of my home screen.

2481
02:46:42,580 --> 02:46:43,420
It's so cute.

2482
02:46:47,880 --> 02:46:50,100
Have you played the Toohu rhythm game, Danmako Kagura?

2483
02:46:50,660 --> 02:46:52,240
Used to be a mobile game, but now it's a PC.

2484
02:46:52,380 --> 02:46:53,200
I haven't actually.

2485
02:46:54,480 --> 02:46:55,180
I haven't actually.

2486
02:46:57,040 --> 02:47:00,200
Let me get this.

2487
02:47:07,990 --> 02:47:08,470
Close.

2488
02:47:10,210 --> 02:47:10,690
Save.

2489
02:47:12,050 --> 02:47:12,350
Screenshot.

2490
02:47:21,560 --> 02:47:23,640
My screen is so aesthetic.

2491
02:47:23,780 --> 02:47:28,980
But I was thinking of changing it recently anyway, So that's
why I'm fine with showing you guys.

2492
02:47:33,090 --> 02:47:36,270
So like you can set up, so basically see how I like, there's
the pictures.

2493
02:47:37,070 --> 02:47:48,950
I have, I have a, it's like you put it in a note app and
then you can like set the notes as like a picture like on

2494
02:47:48,950 --> 02:47:49,610
your screen.

2495
02:47:50,310 --> 02:47:53,310
So I like have it all aesthetic and all set up and cute.

2496
02:47:54,570 --> 02:48:04,470
It's not usually like set up like this like the the arona
picture is on like the second page of my of my screen but um

2497
02:48:04,470 --> 02:48:15,850
it's usually just kind of like this it's so cute right i
think i'm gonna redo it for summer so meow tower is so base

SMH.

2503
02:49:00,220 --> 02:49:01,020
I don't know, actually.

2504
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:02,900
Let's see what most of that is from.

2505
02:49:04,740 --> 02:49:06,580
Most of it is actually from Line.

2506
02:49:08,660 --> 02:49:11,300
Because I follow a bunch of brand accounts online.

2507
02:49:12,340 --> 02:49:20,260
So it's just like, oh, this brand, this like, this clothing
brand sent me a thing.

2508
02:49:20,900 --> 02:49:21,980
So it's mostly from those.

2509
02:49:25,710 --> 02:49:27,450
I cannot live without my stylist.

2510
02:49:27,750 --> 02:49:28,070
Me too.

2511
02:49:31,110 --> 02:49:33,050
I also use Samsung Note.

2512
02:49:34,330 --> 02:49:34,850
Let's see.

2513
02:49:35,190 --> 02:49:37,130
I'm going to put this back.

2514
02:49:40,390 --> 02:49:42,050
And get my...

2515
02:49:42,050 --> 02:49:45,450
But usually at the top I have like a clock.

2516
02:49:46,390 --> 02:49:49,370
And then I also have like a clock widget.

2517
02:49:49,630 --> 02:49:53,030
And I also have like one that...

2518
02:49:53,030 --> 02:49:53,550
What's the word?

2519
02:49:54,110 --> 02:49:55,930
Converts the time to Tokyo.

2520
02:49:56,430 --> 02:49:57,370
Like one of those.

2521
02:49:58,190 --> 02:49:59,310
Actually, where is that?

2522
02:49:59,690 --> 02:50:00,310
And I have a...

2523
02:50:00,330 --> 02:50:11,610
weather one which I'm setting up again right now this one oh
my

2524
02:50:18,740 --> 02:50:30,960
things all messed up now oh well but yeah I love my phone I
wish I could have gotten the blue archive the blue archive

2525
02:50:30,960 --> 02:50:40,120
one though I'm so sad about like there was a special edition
blue archive phone that I couldn't get So, I rotate through

2526
02:50:40,120 --> 02:50:40,940
wallpapers too.

2527
02:50:41,480 --> 02:50:44,080
Too much to keep a unique icon theme.

2528
02:50:44,220 --> 02:50:44,360
Really?

2529
02:50:44,520 --> 02:50:46,720
I like this one because it's kind of hard to tell.

2530
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:52,320
But, um, down here, the, you see, like, the different pages?

2531
02:50:52,820 --> 02:50:54,080
They're actually heart shapes.

2532
02:50:54,620 --> 02:51:01,500
And then when I, like, um, my whole thing is, like, all my
texts and everything are, like, um, I don't have anything

2533
02:51:01,500 --> 02:51:06,120
that I could, like, I would have to block out, like,
everything if I were to show you my texts.

2534
02:51:07,460 --> 02:51:13,000
makes everything hearts and cherries and it's like a purple
gingham theme it's super duper cute

2535
02:51:18,740 --> 02:51:19,940
so yeah

2536
02:51:24,580 --> 02:51:33,940
the go app is go taxi in japan if you i recommend getting
that if you if you well if you use taxis i only used it a

2537
02:51:33,940 --> 02:51:40,440
couple times actually i only i really downloaded it um
because i prefer taking the train because first of all taxis

2538
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:50,980
are so expensive um but uh i used it um i only downloaded it
closer to the end of my trip because i needed to get a taxi

2539
02:51:50,980 --> 02:52:01,360
uh to the airport and there were no taxis that would like
come to my apartment so is hell all your gotcha games yeah

2540
02:52:08,180 --> 02:52:10,240
Drop the keyboard theme?

2541
02:52:17,490 --> 02:52:18,310
It's just normal.

2542
02:52:19,610 --> 02:52:21,530
It's like, it's so, it's just normal.

2543
02:52:23,670 --> 02:52:26,910
It's relatively easy to get taxis at most train stations,
though.

2544
02:52:27,030 --> 02:52:28,890
Yeah, but I wasn't close to a train station.

2545
02:52:29,450 --> 02:52:32,070
My apartment was quite far, actually, so.

2546
02:52:33,150 --> 02:52:38,290
There was a close-ish train station, but...

2547
02:52:38,290 --> 02:52:39,130
Oh my god.

2548
02:52:39,530 --> 02:52:42,430
Getting my suitcases down the stairs.

2549
02:52:42,450 --> 02:52:49,970
was actual I thought I almost fell down the stairs at one
point I thought I was actually going to pass away a second

2550
02:52:49,970 --> 02:53:00,510
time I was like Oh my god I was falling I was falling in
slow motion There's mall things Welcome to membership Thank

2551
02:53:00,510 --> 02:53:04,910
you Yeah That was pretty bad

2552
02:53:09,360 --> 02:53:17,620
Getting suitcases down to Tokyo subway is an experience I
should have probably just how many times does mint have to

2553
02:53:17,620 --> 02:53:29,520
die I probably should have just like kuro neko them to the
to the airport but it's fine can't you just phase your

2554
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:36,140
luggage to the floor I'm a ghost not my luggage not my
luggage

2555
02:53:46,020 --> 02:54:00,780
kuro neko it's um it's a a shipping service it's a shipping
service yeah laughs in Danny Phantom yeah you wouldn't

2556
02:54:00,780 --> 02:54:02,920
imagine how many things Danny Phantom gets wrong

2557
02:54:11,070 --> 02:54:20,430
it's all good I was always too stubborn or cheap to use Kuro
Neko for stuff like that I thought you were talking about

2558
02:54:20,430 --> 02:54:21,030
Ore Ivo

2559
02:54:24,150 --> 02:54:30,290
took the Johane taxi to the Awashima hotel dock in Numazu
last month after I missed the bus and saw it waiting there

2560
02:54:30,290 --> 02:54:34,490
it was a sign you know what that's the most proper time to
use a taxi ever

2561
02:54:39,270 --> 02:54:42,290
that's like the most proper time to use a taxi ever

2562
02:54:45,470 --> 02:54:54,030
but also I've had to use a taxi when I was out late too much
or I was like it was uh I was out too late at one time and

2563
02:54:54,030 --> 02:55:07,130
the trains had stopped so I had to take a taxi home and the
guy the taxi driver was so judgmental because he was like he

2564
02:55:07,130 --> 02:55:15,770
was like why did you stay out so late you know how expensive
this taxi is now you could have gotten yourself a good steak

2565
02:55:15,770 --> 02:55:35,870
I was like sir I need to go home It's not my fault Bank
account mad at me right now Please Stop donating Yeah But it

2566
02:55:35,870 --> 02:55:44,990
was a time I I stayed out for I stayed out because I I went
to see What's it called?

2567
02:55:47,070 --> 02:55:58,370
Inautak and Daoko And some other DJs So obviously at DJ
events, I never stayed late for Mogra though.

2568
02:55:58,910 --> 02:56:07,290
I always left before the final train when I went to Mogra
though because my apartment was really far from Akiva.

2569
02:56:07,890 --> 02:56:19,430
It was so sad because I barely went to Akiva when I last was
in Japan because I was always so far away.

2570
02:56:21,850 --> 02:56:25,770
And also, I'm also Oji-san, I can't stay out so late.

2571
02:56:27,930 --> 02:56:32,170
I stay, I usually, if I stay out late, it's like the latest
is like 3 a.m.

2572
02:56:32,250 --> 02:56:33,770
Which is still pretty late.

2573
02:56:33,970 --> 02:56:36,270
I don't like to ruin my sleep schedule so much.

2574
02:56:36,810 --> 02:56:40,330
Where I'm like up at first train, you know?

2575
02:56:42,630 --> 02:56:43,110
Hmm.

2576
02:56:43,990 --> 02:56:44,630
3 a.m.

2577
02:56:44,670 --> 02:56:45,330
is pretty late.

2578
02:56:45,450 --> 02:56:46,550
It is, but.

2579
02:56:49,070 --> 02:56:50,770
But, it's not as bad.

2580
02:56:51,070 --> 02:56:52,090
Do better VTuber.

2581
02:56:53,170 --> 02:56:53,750

02:58:27,380 --> 02:58:29,140
But at the same time...

2603
02:58:29,140 --> 02:58:30,460
I really want Dress Hina.

2604
02:58:31,100 --> 02:58:33,240
So I'm like...

2605
02:58:34,320 --> 02:58:35,320
What do I do?

2606
02:58:35,940 --> 02:58:37,780
I save for Dress Hina?

2607
02:58:39,180 --> 02:58:39,820
Or...

2608
02:58:39,820 --> 02:58:41,260
You dare approach me.

2609
02:58:41,480 --> 02:58:42,340
Did you get Miku?

2610
02:58:42,680 --> 02:58:43,000
No.

2611
02:58:44,060 --> 02:58:45,300
I didn't get Miku.

2612
02:58:47,200 --> 02:58:48,460
A Mr. Miku.

2613
02:58:51,360 --> 02:58:52,000
Some.

2614
02:58:59,860 --> 02:59:01,340
Yeah, we'll see.

2615
02:59:03,200 --> 02:59:03,840
I got Miku.

2616
02:59:04,020 --> 02:59:04,860
She's kind of bad.

2617
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:08,560
Yeah, I know Dressina is permanent.

2618
02:59:10,380 --> 02:59:11,340
I don't know.

2619
02:59:12,440 --> 02:59:13,220
I don't know.

2620
02:59:14,560 --> 02:59:16,940
I feel like when they do limit, like...

2621
02:59:18,320 --> 02:59:19,860
Two, thank you.

2622
02:59:22,300 --> 02:59:24,220
Would have been set up trains and taxis.

2623
02:59:24,500 --> 02:59:25,100
Motorcycle.

2624
02:59:27,200 --> 02:59:28,380
Like taking a motorcycle?

2625
02:59:32,870 --> 02:59:42,510
I'm even too afraid to ride a bike in Japan I'm not gonna
lie I don't I'm too afraid to ride a bike I'll never drive

2626
02:59:42,510 --> 02:59:44,950
anything I will walk everywhere

2627
02:59:48,490 --> 02:59:59,190
um but I feel like for characters that are like limited
where they're where they're like they'll never come back

2628
02:59:59,190 --> 03:00:02,870
like Miku or the Railgun collab, stuff like that.

2629
03:00:03,190 --> 03:00:09,170
I feel like they don't make them very good on purpose
because, like, I don't know.

2630
03:00:09,630 --> 03:00:17,350
Because if you get them and you miss out, or rather if you
miss out, like, you would be so sad missing out on such a

2631
03:00:17,350 --> 03:00:18,430
good character.

2632
03:00:18,590 --> 03:00:19,090
You know what I mean?

2633
03:00:21,590 --> 03:00:24,250
And the same mentality until I needed to get a license.

2634
03:00:24,550 --> 03:00:29,170
I drive here, but I don't drive.

2635
03:00:29,190 --> 03:00:29,910
in Japan.

2636
03:00:38,100 --> 03:00:40,540
Black Rock Shooter in PGR is also pretty weak.

2637
03:00:48,750 --> 03:00:50,170
What do you mean stinky minto?

2638
03:00:58,750 --> 03:01:01,090
But the scenes though, true.

2639
03:01:02,430 --> 03:01:07,530
Oh my gosh, did you guys see with the ReZero collab for
Niki?

2640
03:01:08,530 --> 03:01:14,690
Okay, when I saw like the previews for it, I was actually
pretty disappointed.

2641
03:01:16,350 --> 03:01:18,110
I was like...

2642
03:01:18,110 --> 03:01:20,130
Some coin for the rail dress cut button.

2643
03:01:22,250 --> 03:01:23,470
Stop it, please.

2644
03:01:23,650 --> 03:01:26,690
If you ever feel the need to donate, never donate because of
Gacha.

2645
03:01:27,350 --> 03:01:28,490
It makes me feel so dirty.

2646
03:01:32,850 --> 03:01:33,450
Um...

2647
03:01:33,450 --> 03:01:35,250
But, uh...

2648
03:01:35,250 --> 03:01:37,490
I was so disappointed by the...

2649
03:01:37,870 --> 03:01:39,670
ReZero because...

2650
03:01:39,670 --> 03:01:40,810
Where's the jiggle?

2651
03:01:41,730 --> 03:01:42,910
Where's the jiggle?

2652
03:01:43,950 --> 03:01:46,230
That's all Nike is!

2653
03:01:46,350 --> 03:01:48,330
Well, not all, but it's live.

2654
03:01:49,490 --> 03:01:50,370
Just no jiggle.

2655
03:01:50,650 --> 03:01:51,450
It's so sad.

2656
03:01:52,430 --> 03:01:53,310
So disappointing.

2657
03:01:57,570 --> 03:01:59,230
But it was cute.

2658
03:01:59,470 --> 03:02:00,470
They were very cute.

2659
03:02:04,360 --> 03:02:06,220
I heard the Rizero collab was super rushed.

2660
03:02:12,680 --> 03:02:13,260
Interesting.

2661
03:02:14,160 --> 03:02:16,280
I don't know why it would be, but...

2662
03:02:20,680 --> 03:02:21,840
Request of the Rights Holder.

2663
03:02:21,920 --> 03:02:22,960
I was thinking that too.

2664
03:02:25,140 --> 03:02:25,540
But...

2665
03:02:28,320 --> 03:02:28,720
Um...

2666
03:02:28,720 --> 03:02:31,180
I was thinking of that too, but...

2667
03:02:31,180 --> 03:02:32,280
But it's Nikkei.

2668
03:02:33,500 --> 03:02:35,240
It's that kind of game, you know?

2669
03:02:36,200 --> 03:02:36,600
Like...

2670
03:02:37,980 --> 03:02:40,520
I feel like it's really weird to be like...

2671
03:02:40,520 --> 03:02:41,900
Oh, by the way, don't...

2672
03:02:41,900 --> 03:02:44,180
Don't make them jiggle, even though that's like...

2673
03:02:44,180 --> 03:02:45,460
The appeal of your game.

2674
03:02:45,760 --> 03:02:46,080
You know?

2675
03:02:46,600 --> 03:02:47,280
I don't know.

2676
03:02:48,260 --> 03:02:48,580
I feel like...

2677
03:02:48,600 --> 03:02:53,460
ago a vtuber graduated and she mentioned she liked getting
supers from fans talking of their achievements that

2678
03:02:53,460 --> 03:03:04,540

because of her let's go oh my gosh chosen that's so awesome

Let's go.

2682
03:03:27,620 --> 03:03:28,800
What's kilogram in American?

2683
03:03:29,180 --> 03:03:30,000
I don't know, actually.

2684
03:03:31,140 --> 03:03:31,680
Let's see.

2685
03:03:35,860 --> 03:03:38,040
One kilogram is two pounds.

2686
03:03:39,020 --> 03:03:41,180
Uh, it's a little over ten pounds.

2687
03:03:44,580 --> 03:03:46,160
It's a little over...

2688
03:03:47,420 --> 03:03:50,080
Two point five pounds.

2689
03:03:50,160 --> 03:04:14,950
to kilogram so yeah 11 11 pounds how much that is that in
hamburgers like wait hold on four quarter pounders four

2690
03:04:16,900 --> 03:04:21,700
times 11 44 burgers

2691
03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:30,160
That's a lot of meat.

2692
03:04:31,700 --> 03:04:32,880
That's a lot of meat.

2693
03:04:37,040 --> 03:04:38,480
I lost 44 burgers.

2694
03:04:39,200 --> 03:04:39,480
Yeah!

2695
03:04:41,980 --> 03:04:42,940
44 burgers!

2696
03:04:44,180 --> 03:04:44,960
I don't want a burger.

2697
03:04:45,980 --> 03:04:48,320
I don't want a burger.

2698
03:04:49,940 --> 03:04:50,320
Yummy.

2699
03:04:52,180 --> 03:04:58,020
Go to items, gifts, donate gifts to gain star dust.

2700
03:04:58,120 --> 03:05:00,880
50 star dust buys one summon to gift from the shop.

2701
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,600
I don't think I have enough items, though, right?

2702
03:05:05,660 --> 03:05:06,140
Wait.

2703
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:15,200
I also don't want to give away my gifts if I'm going to give
them to if I want to level up Hoshino, right?

2704
03:05:20,980 --> 03:05:22,560
Oh, I forgot.

2705
03:05:28,090 --> 03:05:30,570
I'm just using, I'm just putting everything that I've
gotten.

2706
03:05:34,180 --> 03:05:35,760
You probably have enough for one ticket.

2707
03:05:36,660 --> 03:05:40,340
For one, one poll or One poll.

2708
03:05:41,280 --> 03:05:42,200

Thank you.

2712
03:05:49,240 --> 03:05:50,140
One poll, yeah.

2713
03:05:50,260 --> 03:05:51,460
Oh, that's not worth it then.

2714
03:05:53,900 --> 03:05:55,200
That's not worth it.

2715
03:05:58,160 --> 03:06:01,380
You can get free stuff in the VIP tab since you bought Jade.

2716
03:06:01,540 --> 03:06:02,040
Oh, really?

2717
03:06:02,840 --> 03:06:03,320
VIP.

2718
03:06:04,520 --> 03:06:05,200
Where is that?

2719
03:06:09,750 --> 03:06:10,230
VF.

2720
03:06:19,360 --> 03:06:20,120

2722
03:06:30,860 --> 03:06:32,300
Oh yeah, I have to buy these too.

2723
03:06:32,540 --> 03:06:33,440
No way.

2724
03:06:35,420 --> 03:06:36,300
880!

2725
03:06:37,680 --> 03:06:39,160
Oh my gosh.

2726
03:06:39,600 --> 03:06:42,980
It's $15 per outfit.

2727
03:06:44,060 --> 03:06:45,400
It hurts.

2728
03:06:45,980 --> 03:06:47,480
It hurts so bad.

2729
03:06:54,700 --> 03:06:55,900
It hurts so bad.

2730
03:07:07,910 --> 03:07:09,790
Chances to change failures to success.

2731
03:07:11,750 --> 03:07:12,350
Yay!

2732
03:07:16,830 --> 03:07:19,010
I still don't see the VIP tag though.

2733
03:07:30,280 --> 03:07:31,280

Meow.

2751

You can use that dust to buy gacha tickets.

2752
03:08:55,390 --> 03:08:56,070
What's the dust?

2753
03:08:59,880 --> 03:09:00,400

Star dust to Jade?

2759
03:09:18,520 --> 03:09:20,180
100 star dust equals two rolls.

2760
03:09:20,700 --> 03:09:20,700
Really?

2761
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:22,360

Here we go.

2769
03:09:48,300 --> 03:09:49,400
And I have...

2770
03:09:49,400 --> 03:09:50,460
How many do I have?

2771
03:09:52,460 --> 03:09:54,000
What's a rename scroll?

2772
03:09:54,280 --> 03:09:56,020
You may change your nickname and...

2773
03:09:56,020 --> 03:09:56,420
Oh.

2774
03:09:57,260 --> 03:09:57,920
What?

2775
03:09:59,040 --> 03:10:01,920
Why does it cost actual money to change my name?

2776
03:10:02,620 --> 03:10:03,280
What?

2777
03:10:07,450 --> 03:10:08,770
Oh, I have a hundred.

2778
03:10:09,350 --> 03:10:09,850
Okay!

2779
03:10:13,150 --> 03:10:14,290
No way.

2780
03:10:14,830 --> 03:10:16,810
That's so expensive even.

2781
03:10:20,090 --> 03:10:21,230
Yo Star, why?

2782
03:10:22,790 --> 03:10:23,310
I

2783
03:10:27,360 --> 03:10:28,060
don't have enough.

2784
03:10:28,280 --> 03:10:29,600
Okay, let's do this one then.

2785
03:10:30,380 --> 03:10:30,780
Why not?

2786
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:32,680
What's this one do anyway?

2787
03:10:33,500 --> 03:10:35,000
One random green gift.

2788
03:10:38,750 --> 03:10:40,030
One random purple gift.

2789
03:10:41,910 --> 03:10:42,490
You know what, whatever.

2790
03:10:42,730 --> 03:10:43,710
Well, I couldn't summon once.

2791
03:10:46,750 --> 03:10:47,010
Tap.

2792
03:10:51,300 --> 03:10:52,520
I think they gave me a chance.

2793
03:10:52,540 --> 03:10:54,720
We have one rename ticket out for free at some point.

2794
03:10:54,820 --> 03:10:55,420
That's crazy!

2795
03:10:55,600 --> 03:10:56,240
Only one!

2796
03:10:58,940 --> 03:11:00,320
Okay, re-summon.

2797
03:11:01,680 --> 03:11:03,060
This is the one.

2798
03:11:14,920 --> 03:11:15,220
Okay.

2799
03:11:18,700 --> 03:11:22,140
What if you, um, what happens if you get a dupe?

2800
03:11:34,220 --> 03:11:35,900
You still have three single pulls.

2801
03:11:36,100 --> 03:11:40,900
I'm thinking I'm using them because if I buy, let's see.

2802
03:11:48,840 --> 03:11:51,480
wait if i get wait 480

2803
03:11:55,760 --> 03:12:02,340
this one would be close right wait 480 hold on the blue
donuts

2804
03:12:10,560 --> 03:12:21,820
it's so it's oh it's a little off yeah we'll just do the
solo or we'll just do the though some let's do it we have a

2805
03:12:21,820 --> 03:12:26,600
couple Girl,

2806
03:12:31,720 --> 03:12:32,140
diamond.

2807
03:12:33,980 --> 03:12:35,380
One, two more.

2808
03:12:42,810 --> 03:12:47,210
I really like the art style of Blue Archive in Majang Soul,
but I think I'll pass.

2809
03:12:47,290 --> 03:12:48,570
Trying to rehabilitate from Gacha.

2810
03:12:48,950 --> 03:12:49,910
Only Blue Archive currently.

2811
03:12:50,010 --> 03:12:50,330
You know what?

2812
03:12:51,410 --> 03:12:53,010
That's basically me, Haido.

2813
03:12:53,330 --> 03:12:55,970
I only have one Gacha that I like actually...

2814
03:12:57,490 --> 03:12:58,450
Like, try.

2815
03:13:02,330 --> 03:13:04,470
Even in this game...

2816
03:13:05,090 --> 03:13:08,250
Even in this game, like, the gotcha feels...

2817
03:13:08,250 --> 03:13:10,990
Maybe it's more expensive because, like...

2818
03:13:11,890 --> 03:13:14,230
In this, you really don't have to do the gotcha.

2819
03:13:14,830 --> 03:13:15,550
You know what I mean?

2820
03:13:15,950 --> 03:13:18,010
Like, in other games, you get gotcha...

2821
03:13:18,010 --> 03:13:20,090
You get other characters for, like, special abilities.

2822
03:13:20,230 --> 03:13:22,670
But in this game, it's, like, just cosmetic.

2823
03:13:23,130 --> 03:13:25,390
So maybe that's why it's, like, kind of more expensive,
right?

2824
03:13:26,170 --> 03:13:28,030
I want to head pat Hoshi no.

2825
03:13:30,370 --> 03:13:32,670
So, I kind of understand it.

2826
03:13:32,770 --> 03:13:40,190
Like in other games, it's like, you know, you get characters
to get to do better damage and do stuff like that.

2827
03:13:41,890 --> 03:13:43,430
But here it is just mahjong.

2828
03:13:43,810 --> 03:13:46,210
You can totally play without paying anything.

2829
03:13:46,770 --> 03:13:51,970
So, I mean, not to say that you have to pay for other, like,
you know, other gotcha games too.

2830
03:13:52,410 --> 03:13:54,490
But I get it, I get it.

2831
03:13:55,170 --> 03:13:55,750
A little bit.

2832
03:14:03,620 --> 03:14:13,600
okay there's one really funny thing about hoshino it is her
recollection if you look up hoshino's recollection charlie

2833
03:14:13,600 --> 03:14:21,860
thank you for the five gifted thank you thank you so much if
you look up hoshino's recollection in blue archive oh my god

2834
03:14:21,860 --> 03:14:38,800
her face is so dumb it's so it's so silly goes to she goes
to the aquarium and like it's the live 2d where her eyes are

2835
03:14:38,800 --> 03:14:48,540
just like bugging out of her head she and she goes like like
her eyes are literally like bugging out it's so funny let me

2836
03:14:48,540 --> 03:14:52,400

2837
03:15:04,430 --> 03:15:08,390
Oh no, wait, there's none that shows her buggy eyes.

2838
03:15:09,690 --> 03:15:10,370
Boo, I'm back!

2839
03:15:10,670 --> 03:15:12,150
Welcome back!

2840
03:15:12,930 --> 03:15:13,530
Woohoo!

2841
03:15:15,150 --> 03:15:15,790
Supachari!

2842
03:15:18,850 --> 03:15:21,930
I wonder if there's like a gift of it.

2843
03:15:27,250 --> 03:15:27,610
No.

2844
03:15:27,630 --> 03:15:29,030
It's just her standing there.

2845
03:15:31,050 --> 03:15:31,930
I need the movement.

2846
03:15:32,350 --> 03:15:33,230
I need the hua!

2847
03:15:35,830 --> 03:15:37,170
There are videos on YouTube?

2848
03:15:37,990 --> 03:15:38,370
Yeah.

2849
03:15:39,030 --> 03:15:41,910
Let me turn off the audio real quick because I don't want it
to play.

2850
03:15:42,930 --> 03:15:46,490
I don't want to get copyright struck by anybody.

2851
03:15:47,650 --> 03:15:48,150
Let's see.

2852
03:15:49,830 --> 03:15:50,050
Okay.

2853
03:15:50,630 --> 03:15:51,370
There we go.

2854
03:15:56,990 --> 03:15:58,470
Head pat, hooshino.

2855
03:15:59,170 --> 03:16:00,610
Head pat hooshino.

2856
03:16:01,670 --> 03:16:03,250
When did she do that?

2857
03:16:03,470 --> 03:16:04,010
Oh, there it is.

2858
03:16:04,830 --> 03:16:05,430
Oh,

2859
03:16:11,690 --> 03:16:12,210
my God.

2860
03:16:12,770 --> 03:16:13,970
It's so funny.

2861
03:16:38,480 --> 03:16:40,540
It's the movement, too, with it.

2862
03:16:40,780 --> 03:16:42,880
It's just her eyes are buggy so much.

2863
03:16:46,600 --> 03:16:47,200
Wee.

2864
03:16:48,940 --> 03:16:49,540
Wee.

2865
03:16:50,480 --> 03:16:51,080
Wee.

2866
03:17:05,540 --> 03:17:06,620
It's so funny.

2867
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:09,800
I like seeing it every time.

2868
03:17:09,960 --> 03:17:11,800
It makes me laugh every time.

2869
03:17:28,990 --> 03:17:31,450
Some of you have been asking for way three.

2870
03:17:41,390 --> 03:17:42,550
Oh my god.

2871
03:17:43,570 --> 03:17:45,430
It's like, oh god, it's so scary.

2872
03:17:45,770 --> 03:17:47,810
Every time I blink...

2873
03:17:58,850 --> 03:17:59,790
There we go.

2874
03:18:00,390 --> 03:18:01,750
It's just a little bit wobbly.

2875
03:18:10,070 --> 03:18:13,750
Thank you guys again for teaching me how to play Mahjong a
little bit at least.

2876
03:18:14,630 --> 03:18:15,970
I will keep practicing.

2877
03:18:16,310 --> 03:18:17,930
I will keep playing.

2878
03:18:18,610 --> 03:18:22,630
And one day I would like to do some sort of tournament.

2879
03:18:22,790 --> 03:18:23,050
I don't know.

2880
03:18:23,130 --> 03:18:24,330
Maybe it's a lot of pressure though.

2881
03:18:24,590 --> 03:18:25,830
Maybe I'll just play for fun.

2882
03:18:25,890 --> 03:18:26,290
Who knows.

2883
03:18:27,990 --> 03:18:28,390

Times that are simple.

03:20:36,430 --> 03:20:36,870
Thanks.

2917
03:20:39,630 --> 03:20:41,530

Yeah.

2919
03:20:45,050 --> 03:20:46,430

I don't know if this artist, this was actually like your

So the artist like had a template and I just like, I was
like, oh my gosh, this is perfect.

2922
03:20:56,930 --> 03:20:57,790

Oh, sorry.
