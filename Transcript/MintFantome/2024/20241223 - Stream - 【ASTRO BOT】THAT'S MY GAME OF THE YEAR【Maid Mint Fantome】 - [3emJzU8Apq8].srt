1
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,120
Astro boy...

2
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,520
Astro boy...

3
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,340
Astro boy...

4
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,760
I just realized...

5
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,240
I just realized you guys couldn't hear the song.

6
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,600
The music.

7
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,760
It really became ASMR.

8
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,720
I just realized you guys couldn't hear it.

9
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,140
So I'm just whispering Astro Boy instead.

10
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,210
What game is this again?

11
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,310
This is Astro Boy.

12
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,470
Astro Boy.

13
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,310
In fact, let's just... You know what?

14
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,130
Let's just play a game.

15
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,170
Oh, I had it open earlier.

16
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:39,410
I forgot.

17
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,650
I must respectfully disagree with your game of the year pick.

18
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,350
The best game of the year is Super Mario Bros 3 All Years.

19
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,270
What did you say your name was?

20
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,410
I am Astro Bot.

21
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,150
Astro Bot.

22
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,310
I am Astro Bot.

23
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,390
I am Astro Bot.

24
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,760
Astro Bot.

25
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,980
I am Astro Bot.

26
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,680
I am Astro Bot.

27
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,000
Yay!

28
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,900
Astro Bot!

29
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,580
I didn't have Astro Bot ASMR on my wishlist.

30
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,720
Sorry.

31
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,320
Astro Bot.

32
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,160
I mean, today is my birthday and I would love to hear your world famous happy birthday song.

33
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,360
Keep being awesome and have a great Christmas.

34
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Maniac B, happy birthday!

35
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,720
Happy birthday to you.

36
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,300
Happy birthday.

37
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,640
It's too low.

38
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,260
Happy birthday Maniac B!

39
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,860
I think I messed it up.

40
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,020
I hope you don't mind.

41
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,860
I went to my first idol live in Japan.

42
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,860
What did you say your name was?

43
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,560
I am Astro Bot.

44
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,850
Astro Bot.

45
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:26,430
Yay!

46
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,150
Welcome back!

47
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,610
Sorry, I can't stop singing this song.

48
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:34,650
Oh my gosh, when the game awards happened, I knew that...

49
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:41,570
You know how every year they do the orchestra of all the songs?

50
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,950
And I was just like, oh my gosh, I'm gonna hear Astro Bot's song and then I'm gonna see the flute guy.

51
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,570
And it's gonna be the best experience ever!

52
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,890
And it was!

53
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,010
Minto, they played your truck live at Hallmat today and we did the rowdiest Hamtaro circle we could.

54
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,590
Why did they play that?

55
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,930
Why did they...

56
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,770
I saw, I think... Oh, it was Lewood.

57
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,070
Oh, so basically I was... Okay, hold on.

58
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,570
I was setting up for stream earlier.

59
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,650
I was supposed to have two streams today.

60
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,930
Unfortunately, due to tech issues, the first one didn't happen.

61
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,310
Boo, tech issues.

62
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,110
But while I was setting up, I got a notification on my phone.

63
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,910
And it was like, Lewood went live.

64
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,330
And I was like, first of all, why am I getting this notification?

65
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:34,430
But also, I think maybe because I tuned in when he was streaming the Phantom Thief concert.

66
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,350
Actually, we don't boo tech issues.

67
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,870
That would be a good thing.

68
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,570
Tech issues...

69
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,230
That's what we say.

70
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:04,770
Yeah, and then I got a notification on my phone that was just like, Lewood is streaming and it's called Minto.

71
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,910
And I was like...

72
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,180
Why?

73
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,780
Why?

74
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,360
I was so confused.

75
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,220
Brando, thanks for the superchat.

76
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,420
First time joining the stream.

77
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:18,860
Welcome!

78
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,040
Will my house won't be haunted?

79
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,240
No, won't be haunted.

80
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,140
But it might be haunted.

81
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,380
It's okay.

82
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,820
You get used to the knocks.

83
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,920
And the food going missing.

84
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,260
You get used to it.

85
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,100
Man, I love robots.

86
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,280
Me too!

87
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,940
Look at my little astrobots.

88
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,600
Look at them.

89
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,700
Look how cute they are.

90
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,380
Look at all of them.

91
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,140
It's cold.

92
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,260
Can you turn up the thermostat?

93
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,160
Oh my gosh, I was so cold earlier.

94
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,480
Sorry though, you know, as a ghost and everything, it kind of like...

95
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,940
Chills the...

96
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,980
It's great for summer.

97
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,540
Having a haunted house.

98
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,820
Great for summer.

99
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,940
Kind of sucks in the winter, you know.

100
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,020
BabyGori, thanks for the gift!

101
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,940
Mom's with Minky plus AstroTurfBot.

102
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,260
AstroBot!

103
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,070
Say what?

104
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,350
This is my game of the year, baby.

105
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,650
I love this game.

106
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,350
Everyone else can...

107
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:34,770
Can...

108
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,510
Can play AstroBot and then be like, yeah!

109
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,670
Good game.

110
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,410
Yeah!

111
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,990
I also, I haven't...

112
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,570
Okay, that's a lie.

113
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,230
I touched Astro's playroom a little bit.

114
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,990
Since it's free, you know.

115
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:53,970
But...

116
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,350
There's some mechanics in it that...

117
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,650
I actually really liked.

118
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,570
That I wish they put into this game.

119
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,530
My game of the year as well, but I need to play Metaphor.

120
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,690
That's fair.

121
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,850
Black Myth Wukong, Baldur's Gate 3.

122
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:13,930
Baldur's Gate...

123
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,210
Baldur's Gate 3 was not this year.

124
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,510
That was not on the list.

125
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,630
AstroBot for me.

126
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,850
My thing with Black Myth Wukong is...

127
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:33,550
Besides hearing how sore losers the developers were.

128
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,850
That kind of like ruined the vibes for me.

129
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,490
I was like, oh come on guys.

130
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,070
Don't gotta be like that.

131
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,310
The thing about it is...

132
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,870
I saw everybody posting the beginning of the game.

133
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,590
Where you like fly through the sky.

134
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,070
And you fight in the clouds or whatever.

135
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,710
And they're like, this is the best.

136
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,710
This is most amazing everything ever.

137
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,110
And I've never seen anything past that.

138
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,890
I never...

139
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,520
The English translations were messed up.

140
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,140
I thought I saw...

141
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,700
I heard people saying that they were like crying.

142
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,980
It was a mistranslation.

143
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,220
The lead was way more positive after people added the context.

144
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,580
Were they not crying in the audience then?

145
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,740
I don't know.

146
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,020
I mean, I can't say.

147
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,200
I wasn't there, so...

148
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,720
I don't know.

149
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,300
Anyway.

150
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,880
If it was a mistranslation, I'll take that.

151
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,440
It's still kind of...

152
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,180
Everybody was just like...

153
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,160
It was fine.

154
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,420
And then everyone was like, oh okay.

155
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,960
The vibes got a little soured.

156
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,060
Just because of the...

157
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,020
I guess the...

158
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,640
What's the word?

159
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,400
I don't want to get so much into it.

160
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,400
I don't really care, honestly.

161
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,980
Honestly, I don't care.

162
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,800
It sucks for them.

163
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,600
But I don't really care.

164
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,460
The cry was also debunked.

165
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,180
Shown on film behind Astro Bot Dev's wedding.

166
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,520
And they were smiling and clapping.

167
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,520
Oh, okay.

168
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,220
Well then, people are just liars.

169
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:13,860
What?

170
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,580
But people would go on the internet and lie.

171
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,800
Never heard of that before, ever.

172
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,670
Never heard of it.

173
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,310
But what I was saying is...

174
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,890
I've never seen anything past like the first 15 minutes.

175
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:28,470
Or never...

176
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,230
People always show...

177
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,750
They're just like...

178
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,710
Black Myth Wukong is like...

179
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,070
If it's Game of the Year, why have I never seen anything else?

180
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,290
Besides...

181
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,150
Whatever...

182
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,210
The 15 minutes first of the gameplay.

183
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,650
I was like, has anyone else...

184
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,050
Has anyone played past that?

185
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,130
I don't even know.

186
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,690
I don't really care though.

187
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,730
I love Astro Bot.

188
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,690
Yeah, what was going online and spreading misinformation?

189
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,490
Just go on the internet and lie?

190
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,090
Never.

191
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,350
Never.

192
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,790
Stellar Blade was robbed.

193
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,370
I keep getting this one person...

194
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,230
Almost like daily...

195
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,210
Or whenever I post my schedule, I guess.

196
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,870
They're just like, still waiting on that Stellar Blade stream.

197
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,530
And I'm like...

198
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,370
The more you do that, the less I'm gonna wanna do...

199
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,010
The less I'm gonna wanna play it.

200
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,770
He's dedicated, can't fault him.

201
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,150
Yeah, maybe.

202
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,030
If Minto's Game of the Year is Astro Bot, then my...

203
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,170
Vio.

204
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,170
V2 of the Year is Minto Fandom.

205
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,510
Oh, thank you.

206
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,910
You can fault him.

207
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,600
I'm playing through Stellar Blade.

208
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,820
Pretty cool, but not Game of the Year.

209
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,900
I think people get way too...

210
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,100
Way too invested in...

211
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,640
It's okay.

212
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,960
You're like, just...

213
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,800
It's just...

214
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,220
People get so heated about...

215
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,720
Such small things nowadays.

216
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,100
It's okay.

217
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,940
If your favorite video game...

218
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,700
Didn't win Game of the Year...

219
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,020
Or didn't win the award.

220
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,380
If you like the game...

221
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,680
That's all that matters.

222
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,620
If you had fun with it...

223
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,020
That's all that matters.

224
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,720
People just get so...

225
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,640
So that's why we're gonna enjoy Astro Bot.

226
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,320
Yeah.

227
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,480
Why do they get worked up?

228
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,360
I don't know.

229
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,080
I appreciate the passion, obviously, but...

230
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,240
Oh my gosh, look, it's gold.

231
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,100
What's this?

232
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,440
Oh, Christmas!

233
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,240
What's this?

234
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,260
Oh my god.

235
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,600
I thought we had a...

236
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,700
I thought we had a Christmas hat on, but it's just a little...

237
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,040
It's just our little wee-woo machine.

238
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,380
Is it a birthday?

239
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,700
I'll submit, and that's why Metal Gear is...

240
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,860
I didn't read that.

241
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,320
Mint, you know your PS5 should have a free copy of Astro's Playroom?

242
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,100
Yeah.

243
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,600
I literally just mentioned it.

244
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,760
Maybe you weren't in chat.

245
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,840
Maybe you weren't watching.

246
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,500
Yeah.

247
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,680
I talked about it, like, five minutes ago.

248
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:39,920
Miki!

249
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,600
My birthday was yesterday, but I was sadly out all day.

250
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,780
So today I would like to give you my super chat...

251
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,200
...virtunity?

252
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,840
And humbly request a birthday song from the Minto.

253
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,920
Cats!

254
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,520
Of the...

255
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,180
Happy birthday!

256
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,880
Happy birthday to you.

257
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,080
Happy birthday to you.

258
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,480
Happy birthday, dear cats.

259
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,540
Happy birthday to you.

260
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,760
Happy birthday!

261
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,060
I'm honored to be the first super chat.

262
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,020
Thank you!

263
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,560
My camera here was bilateral.

264
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,520
It's not expected to win.

265
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,640
I honestly didn't expect AstroBot to win.

266
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,140
That's true.

267
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,540
Thank you!

268
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,640
I haven't been able to catch streams due to Christmas plans, so congrats on 300k!

269
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,100
Thank you!

270
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,380
Thank you for the payback!

271
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,700
Thank you!

272
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,780
Thank you, thank you so much!

273
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,600
It's too much.

274
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,380
Please.

275
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,460
Thank you, though.

276
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,590
Thank you so much.

277
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,590
For Bellatro...

278
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,870
I really want to get into it.

279
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,530
Oh my gosh.

280
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,490
I get ads on TikTok for Bellatro.

281
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,690
And I only mention TikTok because it's the only place I get ads for Bellatro.

282
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,990
But... And the marketing is so good.

283
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,730
Every time I see one of the ads, it's kind of creepy.

284
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,030
And I'm just like, oh, I feel like I would love this so much.

285
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,050
I'm just not good with card games.

286
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,830
There's Bellatro ads.

287
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,370
Oh my god, they're so good!

288
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,250
They're so good!

289
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,530
And I just...

290
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,390
I'm just not good with card games.

291
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,450
And I have people that are like, oh, it's like poker.

292
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,450
But I'm really bad at poker and all this.

293
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,870
So I'm just like, I want to play it.

294
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,950
I want to get the hype.

295
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,810
But, like, I believe you guys.

296
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,650
It's just not my...

297
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,570
I'm not yucking your yum.

298
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,110
It's just not my yum.

299
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,940
Have you played Solitaire?

300
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,020
Yeah.

301
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,320
Solitaire and Blackjack are like the only two games I can get.

302
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,840
They're like the only two things I can understand.

303
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,120
And Blackjack, I just say...

304
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,760
I just say hit.

305
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,900
My game of the year is SM2.

306
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,580
SM2?

307
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,780
What's SM2?

308
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,950
You say you're not good with card games.

309
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,750
But I knew some nerd who said they weren't good at stealth games.

310
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,250
So they were scared to play MGS.

311
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,370
That's different though.

312
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,610
Super Minky.

313
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,350
Oh, Space Marine 2.

314
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,950
Oh, yeah.

315
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,670
Did that get dominated for anything?

316
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,790
I feel like with how big Warhammer has become this year.

317
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,600
A few.

318
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,700
Oh, okay, okay.

319
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,040
For what it's worth, all you really need to know for Bellatio is the poker hands.

320
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,480
And the game has a list of them built in.

321
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,600
I don't know, I'm still really intimidated.

322
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,700
I'm still intimidated.

323
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,320
I've never played poker before I played Bellatio.

324
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,840
I now know so much of it.

325
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,040
I have over 5K flush hands played.

326
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,580
Would love to watch you stream.

327
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,300
I don't know.

328
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,240
Why not try one stream where chat can help you?

329
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,220
That's the thing.

330
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,380
Whenever I... Okay, this is gonna sound so bad.

331
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,060
When I have too much hand holding, it doesn't...

332
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,920
It doesn't register in my brain.

333
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,600
You know, I will get so...

334
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:17,080
I'll get so accustomed to looking over at chat for advice.

335
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,340
That I'll just be like, oh, what should I do?

336
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,340
Oh, play this?

337
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:20,760
Okay.

338
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,720
And so I'll just never learn it then.

339
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,180
And it happened with Mahjong too.

340
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,760
I even wrote notes and everything.

341
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,260
But I was like, I didn't retain anything.

342
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,260
So I'll, you know...

343
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,970
At that point it's just chat playing.

344
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,070
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

345
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,410
Chino, thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

346
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,110
So I feel...

347
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,790
Getting backstated seems so miserable.

348
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,850
No, I'm not saying that.

349
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,230
Like, obviously I appreciate the help when I'm new or something.

350
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,170
And people are like, oh yeah, you should try this.

351
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,890
Especially with like a...

352
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,710
With a game like that.

353
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,710
You know, like when everybody was helping me with Holocure.

354
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,010
And being like, oh no, you should try this combo.

355
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,090
Or oh you, when you play this character you should use this.

356
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:13,690
You know?

357
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,430
Things like that.

358
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,270
There's obviously good stuff with it.

359
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,010
But then, you know...

360
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,170
I...

361
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,110
At least with Holocure I kept playing off stream.

362
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,190
So I kind of learned more about it.

363
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,410
I wanna see you get addicted.

364
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,210
Bellatro Pachinko.

365
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,450
Is it truly Bellatro then?

366
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,440
As the funny stick guy said.

367
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,680
Let's go gambling.

368
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,920
Let's go gambling.

369
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,680
Let's go check up on our guys.

370
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Let's check up on our guys here.

371
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,620
Our little funny Astro Boss.

372
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,260
I haven't seen them in so long.

373
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,060
I haven't seen them in so long.

374
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,140
Snake!

375
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,400
Snake!

376
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,080
Snake!

377
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,720
Snake!

378
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,240
Snake!

379
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,300
Snake!

380
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,260
Bootsnake!

381
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,800
I'm gonna take your spot.

382
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,680
Oh, it was right here.

383
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,140
Damn it.

384
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,460
I thought it was the rock.

385
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,800
Let's see.

386
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,780
There was... I also remembered...

387
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,080
There was an area...

388
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,720
On this map...

389
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,600
That we didn't complete.

390
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,780
Happy Holidays Mito.

391
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,980
Happy Holidays!

392
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,240
Hope you all are having a good holiday season.

393
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,540
I don't remember where it was though.

394
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,960
Is Sly Cooper mentioned at all in the game?

395
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:00,740
Yeah!

396
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,700
I just ran past him.

397
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,560
I'll show you.

398
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,280
It might have been one of these...

399
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,820
I might have been over there anyway.

400
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,260
There he is!

401
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,900
Just please don't do any of the time trials.

402
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,640
Why?

403
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:18,980
Why?

404
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,080
Why are you saying that Boner?

405
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,660
200 Bot Pull thing?

406
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah!

407
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,200
Do you remember where it was?

408
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,280
It shows on the map.

409
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,290
It was over here.

410
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,790
I

411
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,980
think I have the Sly outfit too.

412
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,280
But I'm currently a Minky.

413
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,900
I'm Monky.

414
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,140
Monky, Monky, Monky.

415
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,120
Actually, can I just fall?

416
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,160
No, I can't fall.

417
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,920
There they go, my little guys.

418
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,680
So cute.

419
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,760
There it is!

420
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,540
There it is!

421
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,120
Is this it?

422
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,420
Yes, 250.

423
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,920
Oh my god, Minky...

424
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,780
Oh god!

425
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,440
Oh god!

426
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,340
Where did you all come from?

427
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,540
They created a pyramid.

428
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,910
Indiana Jones.

429
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,230
I got a horse!

430
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,890
Trusty steed.

431
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,790
Won't cause you any agro.

432
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,710
And I'm gonna break ancient artifacts just like Indiana Jones.

433
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,010
Thanks guys!

434
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,290
Look how cute they are.

435
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,770
Good job!

436
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,470
Oh my gosh, Snake.

437
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,630
Snake!

438
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,470
Snake!

439
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,710
Are you OK?

440
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,020
Shadow of the Colossus horse.

441
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,760
Look at all of them.

442
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,500
Look at all of them.

443
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,460
Not this guy.

444
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,080
No, I'm just kidding.

445
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,960
I'm just kidding.

446
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,020
OK, that should...

447
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,020
Yep, OK, we have officially completed every area...

448
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,100
in...

449
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,060
in the home world.

450
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,180
Yippee!

451
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,360
And I go!

452
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,080
It's like the slowest run ever.

453
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,060
I've never played Shadow of the Colossus, no.

454
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,620
But...

455
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,600
We have the DLC that I planned on doing today.

456
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,680
The DLC I planned on doing today, baby.

457
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,500
Which is why I've got my trusty hat on.

458
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,980
I'm a bit of a joker today, guys.

459
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,060
Not a joker, sorry.

460
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,120
Grinch.

461
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,100
I mean, I am kind of a joker.

462
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,340
I'm a joker too.

463
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,560
I'm a joker.

464
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,500
I got jokes.

465
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,560
Jonkler.

466
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,480
Had I known something like Astro Bot was going to be made, I would have gotten PS5.

467
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,160
I love when game companies make these celebrations of their legacies.

468
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,480
It's like such a...

469
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,720
It's just so good.

470
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,160
It's such like a pure...

471
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,940
It's just so fun.

472
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,920
Wow, that's a lot of guys!

473
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,540
Christmas!

474
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,660
Oh my god!

475
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,980
Woah!

476
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,000
Oops.

477
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,560
Christmas!

478
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,100
Anything up there?

479
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,140
Oh my god, the Christmas lights!

480
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,720
Even the bunnies have...

481
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,840
Even the bunnies have Santa hats on.

482
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,660
It's so cute.

483
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,140
It's a lot of bells.

484
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,580
Jingle bells.

485
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,740
Jingle bells.

486
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,500
Oh, sorry.

487
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,180
Sorry.

488
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,360
Woah!

489
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,320
Oh my gosh, look!

490
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:01,780
They jingle!

491
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,790
Oh my god, they have little antler ears!

492
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,510
Destroy them.

493
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,410
From behind, the red guy, I thought he was a Red Among Us.

494
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,910
Oh, I need 15 presents.

495
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,960
Oh, it's the time guy.

496
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,960
Okay.

497
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,930
I heard in Japan they eat KFC for Christmas.

498
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,410
Oops.

499
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,030
I didn't realize I could get knocked off.

500
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,450
I think... I don't know.

501
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,730
Is that still like a popular thing to eat?

502
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,130
KFC.

503
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,270
It used to, for sure, be like a crazy big thing.

504
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:10,670
No!

505
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:11,790
No!

506
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,220
It used to be a crazy big thing.

507
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,260
Just punch the present.

508
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,120
I will.

509
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,880
I'll get to it.

510
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,620
Oh, what's this though?

511
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,640
What's this?

512
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,140
He's looking at me.

513
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,660
What are you looking at?

514
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,450
What's he looking at?

515
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,290
The slime guy is the Grinch.

516
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,130
He's looking at my butt.

517
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,200
Pause!

518
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,900
Punch?

519
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,560
Oh.

520
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,980
I think I missed my opportunity.

521
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,420
My bad.

522
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,320
Yessir!

523
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,080
Happy to catch you live for once and on my birthday!

524
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:11,580
Yeah!

525
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,340
Hope you enjoy playing Astro Boy as much as I do.

526
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,240
Thank you!

527
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,060
Happy birthday!

528
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,120
Oh my god.

529
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,540
Stop.

530
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,900
The gingerbread house has the D-pad on it.

531
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,140
It's so cute.

532
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,340
Happy birthday!

533
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,640
Happy birthday to you!

534
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,740
Happy birthday to you!

535
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,920
Happy birthday Regester!

536
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,840
Happy birthday to you!

537
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,900
Happy birthday!

538
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,540
There's a present over here.

539
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,440
Let's get this one.

540
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,280
Ambush.

541
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,120
Watch out little reindeer!

542
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,160
I'll save you.

543
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,340
Of course.

544
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,560
I can't reach him.

545
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,200
Astro Bot is too small.

546
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,720
Let's get this guy again.

547
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh my god.

548
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,600
I don't think I need to... I think I need to pull it.

549
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,360
What?

550
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,300
That's so messed up!

551
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:31,540
No!

552
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,700
And freeze!

553
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,380
Is

554
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,620
that Rayman?

555
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,460
We got him!

556
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,740
Limbless legend.

557
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,120
Unarmed but still packs a punch.

558
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,400
Looks like... I guess he doesn't have limbs.

559
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,120
He's just got... He's just handsy.

560
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,080
Interesting.

561
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,210
Oh my god.

562
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,070
Rude.

563
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,010
Let's see.

564
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,150
What's in here?

565
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,550
Oh we got the elephant.

566
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,730
What does he do again?

567
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,450
Oh I think he sucks up, right?

568
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,730
And then...

569
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,570
Do I break these?

570
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,130
Let's see.

571
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,110
Oh no, they just tell me where to go for these things.

572
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,070
He suck.

573
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:57,890
No!

574
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,890
Don't be so mean to him.

575
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,130
Don't be mean.

576
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Noice.

577
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,480
Cranberry!

578
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Cranberry!

579
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Cranberry!

580
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
What's the last one?

581
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Prison!

582
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,700
Oh, those are apples.

583
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,700
Just kidding.

584
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,860
Wizard!

585
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,240
Oh my gosh, is that Gex?

586
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,800
He looks so...

587
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,280
Look at him.

588
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,880
Say Gex!

589
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,560
Square-eyed gecko.

590
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,260
Takes channel hopping a little too literally.

591
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,020
So cute.

592
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,720
Goodness gracious.

593
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,460
What's in here?

594
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,420
Can you guys see me?

595
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,680
Try and find Minto.

596
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,200
I bet you can't.

597
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,000
I bet you can't!

598
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,920
I bet you can't!

599
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,560
I bet you can't!

600
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,600
Rude!

601
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:30,890
Stupid.

602
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,270
Bottom right.

603
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:34,370
No!

604
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:36,890
That's cheating.

605
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,770
I'm supposed to do something here.

606
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,330
Ok, grab.

607
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,340
Oh my gosh, so cute!

608
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,660
Makes every flight feel festive.

609
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,560
Go!

610
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,240
Slide!

611
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,660
Let's see what else we can do.

612
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,500
This area feels so...

613
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,160
It's so yummy.

614
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,120
You know, it makes me want to eat gingerbread.

615
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,860
Have you guys had gingerbread yet?

616
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,020
This holiday festive season.

617
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,930
What's this?

618
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,190
I didn't even get to do anything.

619
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,500
I'm so glad I can breathe underwater.

620
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,920
Sorry Patrick.

621
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,160
What's this?

622
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,760
We got the penguin.

623
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,780
This is the guy that makes me go fast, right?

624
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,260
What the hell?

625
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,240
Not yet.

626
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,620
Never eaten it before.

627
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,000
You know, I'm not a fan of ginger, right?

628
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,820
But... Is that a cuttlefish?

629
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,040
But I am a big... I mean obviously it's because it's got sugar in it.

630
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,180
But I am a fan of...

631
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,840
I am a fan of...

632
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,920
The gingerbread.

633
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,360
When I was a kid, my mom would give us ginger snaps.

634
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,420
Ginger snap cookies all the time.

635
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,000
So I ate a lot of ginger.

636
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,740
Oh my gosh, it's these guys.

637
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,640
There are so many videos and pictures of them half eaten.

638
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,140
Sunfish, right?

639
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,880
I think we can leave in there.

640
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,280
Mola mola.

641
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,220
Mola mola.

642
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,080
Ambush!

643
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,320
Where did that guy come from?

644
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,020
The wall?

645
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,100
The wall?

646
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,680
The wall.

647
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,380
Every time I see you play this, I think how crazy it is.

648
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,140
Oh, I see it.

649
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:14,780
Thank you guys.

650
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,520
Beautiful!

651
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,660
What's in here?

652
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,480
Anything?

653
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,480
Nope.

654
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,480
A bouncer on PS2 and thought...

655
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,280
That was going to be peak game graphics and tech.

656
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,540
I thought that about Kingdom Hearts 2.

657
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,480
Especially like the...

658
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,020
Especially like, you know, the...

659
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,620
Opening scenes.

660
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,240
The non-endgame stuff.

661
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,980
What is this?

662
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,200
Pre-rendered.

663
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,540
Yeah, yeah.

664
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,080
Thank you.

665
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,620
Wildchild.

666
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,560
Pig Wrangler extraordinaire.

667
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,700
Tomba.

668
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,060
I don't know it.

669
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,210
Oh my god, the snail.

670
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,330
It has a big ol' orb.

671
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,270
I think that's...

672
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:26,750
Everything.

673
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,180
I love Tomba's again.

674
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,890
Just every...

675
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:46,610
Every tiny little reference in this feels so...

676
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,270
Like this...

677
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,030
It makes everything feel so loved, you know?

678
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,190
So sweet.

679
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,670
Can I use this in this?

680
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,710
Yeah, right?

681
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:56,490
Oh wait.

682
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,440
It worked!

683
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,020
Vengeful spirit outfit?

684
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,520
That's me!

685
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,380
Follow the warrior code.

686
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,920
Or don't.

687
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,840
Let's not go to Tsushima.

688
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,240
I wonder if I could... Oh wait.

689
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,300
I think I have to use...

690
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,220
The intended route is to monkey it.

691
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,240
We gotta get the monkey arms.

692
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,760
I see.

693
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,280
There's a bunch of monkey arm stuff too.

694
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,680
Like the bananas and everything.

695
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,180
Unless you get him up there.

696
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,120
That might be where you get him from.

697
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,460
Let's go check.

698
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,060
Let's go check.

699
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,420
Check, check, check.

700
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,380
Bananas.

701
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh.

702
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,160
Just kidding.

703
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,660
What?

704
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,360
I didn't actually...

705
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,540
What am I supposed to do here?

706
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,620
I didn't actually check behind here.

707
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,620
Use jetpack on the circle.

708
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,500
Thank you.

709
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,060
Monkey!

710
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,050
I knew he'd be here.

711
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,260
Nice!

712
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,020
Minky real!

713
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,200
Minky real!

714
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,480
The monkey has so much uses.

715
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,120
Oh my gosh!

716
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,000
The apples have little stars in them!

717
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,180
Polygon.

718
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,820
Polychroma dual speeder.

719
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:27,820
Fancy.

720
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,700
Oh my god!

721
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,060
Oh my god!

722
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,560
I almost didn't make it.

723
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,190
Destroy!

724
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:47,790
Destroy!

725
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:48,590
Destroy!

726
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:48,910
Destroy!

727
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:49,950
Destroy!

728
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,420
What's down here?

729
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,680
The inflation.

730
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:22,330
No, I wasn't ready!

731
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:24,030
Oh my god.

732
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,570
Look how squishy it looks.

733
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,390
Looks so yummy.

734
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:35,550
Nice.

735
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,570
We made it.

736
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,710
Oh.

737
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:39,230
Oh.

738
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:42,550
Wait.

739
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,070
I don't... Wait.

740
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,510
I missed it!

741
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,410
Is that Spider-Man?

742
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,330
No way!

743
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,460
Youthful Protector.

744
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,760
When it comes to fighting crime he is miles ahead.

745
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,700
It's Miles Morales!

746
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,140
That guy!

747
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,260
Wait.

748
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,120
I'm lost.

749
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,960
They put me in a place I don't...

750
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,120
I was following the path.

751
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,240
Now I don't know where I am.

752
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:20,680
OK.

753
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,320
What's over here?

754
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:26,730
Oh.

755
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:27,610
The frog.

756
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:28,490
The punchy frogs.

757
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,740
The only thing about this game series is...

758
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,720
I don't know why they make the sentient trees so damn terrifying.

759
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,800
They make them so darn scary.

760
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:59,350
It might be my one...

761
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,530
My one criticism.

762
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,270
I have to find a way all the way back up there.

763
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,190
Damn it game.

764
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,790
I wasn't ready to go.

765
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,750
I'm doing a shot into oblivion.

766
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,180
What was I supposed to do?

767
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:22,420
Oh.

768
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:22,840
Monkey.

769
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,740
So I have to go get the monkey again.

770
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,700
But to get the monkey I have to go through all of this again.

771
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,000
The very start of the level has a present.

772
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:37,260
Yeah, but I need 7... I need 15 to get it.

773
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,460
Wait, where is the... Where is the gingerbread?

774
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,800
Oh, I can open it now?

775
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,200
Shelf time!

776
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,060
Oh, it's just telling me how many I have.

777
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,660
Oh, I thought it was that I needed that much to open it.

778
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,980
How do I get up there?

779
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,160
Game, why did you take away my... Why did you take it away?

780
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,800
How do

781
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,600
I get up there?

782
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,400
I'm

783
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,640
not Minky.

784
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,320
I guess let's just go this way.

785
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,420
Oh no, it's a puzzle.

786
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,360
I think.

787
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,240
Wait, is there any other guys?

788
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:20,560
Okay.

789
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,010
Now the three of you.

790
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,170
Where are we going?

791
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,550
That doesn't break those open.

792
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:53,530
Oh, yes it does.

793
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,090
Just kidding.

794
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,430
Nice, nice, nice.

795
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:58,370
Secret.

796
00:48:58,970 --> 00:48:59,230
Okay.

797
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,210
Alright, let's get all the stuff first and then we'll go all the way back around.

798
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,510
I don't think I got it.

799
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,530
I don't know if I got it.

800
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:20,750
It's a little bit embarrassing.

801
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:27,150
One more time!

802
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:36,830
And...

803
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,320
Smile through the pants.

804
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,060
Pretty much.

805
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,080
Arch stowed explorer outfit.

806
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,700
Gives you an armored car.

807
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,520
Wait, did I feel another one?

808
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,360
Wait, what's this?

809
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,120
Oh, it's just the... All of the cookies.

810
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,840
Sorry, my... What's it called?

811
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,620
No, no, no, no, no.

812
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,000
My controller was all vibrating.

813
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,060
Okay, we got this now!

814
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,620
Surely from here!

815
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:44,990
And then I can go up here and become a monkey.

816
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,080
Stupid birds.

817
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,440
Nice.

818
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:06,100
Let's go also destroy this alien.

819
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,980
Become rinky.

820
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,640
Stupid!

821
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,580
Watch out, reindeer!

822
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,520
Urban dash dual speeder.

823
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,400
Oh, I thought...

824
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,980
I thought it was going to be more...

825
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,600
No way.

826
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,200
No way, we didn't complete it, did we?

827
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,540
I thought it was going to be more actual little bots.

828
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,180
Than like outfits and stuff.

829
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,580
No, we still have five left!

830
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,900
Become rinky.

831
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,740
Crazy taxi.

832
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,540
Where you see that?

833
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,200
No, we still have five left.

834
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,560
Christmas tree, what are you talking about?

835
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,260
We still have so much to do!

836
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,160
Do I need the frogs for this?

837
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,200
Yup.

838
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,140
I think so.

839
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,580
Oh, it's a crazy taxi color.

840
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,020
I guess it did kind of look like that, yeah.

841
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,790
Let's see, what else is around here?

842
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:34,850
What are you doing?

843
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:36,870
Quit having fun!

844
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,920
Oh, what's up here?

845
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,000
Something?

846
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,200
Which way do I go?

847
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,040
I think I have to candy cane it.

848
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,460
Wait, where is it?

849
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:58,540
Santa!

850
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:13,210
OK, nevermind.

851
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,550
Where do I go?

852
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,540
What am I supposed to do here?

853
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,380
Break the window?

854
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,120
Oh, you need to find the chicken.

855
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:40,670
The chicken.

856
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,810
The chicken is... Oh my god, so cute.

857
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:45,610
Oh, up there!

858
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:58,100
There is a frog, elephant, mouse.

859
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,800
Oh, we never got that one.

860
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,660
Wait, where is the mouse?

861
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:08,580
It's around here, maybe down here.

862
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,780
Seems like it.

863
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,660
Yes.

864
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,660
The mouse.

865
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,380
Angering the mouse.

866
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,320
Is there anything up here?

867
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,300
Guess we'll never know.

868
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,760
Cheese party!

869
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,720
Where is the big cheese?

870
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,320
I need

871
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:55,590
Bitcoin!

872
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,920
So cute.

873
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,000
And in we go.

874
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,940
Not all heroes wear capes.

875
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,900
Some wear antlers.

876
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:31,540
The way you had to choose the right power-up for each section of the level reminds me of Mint Phantom's Freaker Tree.

877
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,880
It's kinda like that one.

878
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,360
Which, the update is going to be soon.

879
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:45,520
And the other day they were like, this is how many more levels there are.

880
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,360
And I was like...

881
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:00,430
This is a lot of levels.

882
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:08,330
Many, many more levels.

883
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:15,350
So if you like the game, you can play lots of it.

884
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:18,370
Wow, oh my gosh, so many coins.

885
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,290
This level is so generous.

886
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,180
Oh, oopsie.

887
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,900
One more, one more try please.

888
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,260
Thank you.

889
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,200
No, no, wrong, wrong button.

890
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:45,820
There we go.

891
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,220
What is this?

892
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,440
That's right, the chicken makes you...

893
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:09,850
Okay, okay.

894
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:11,530
Okay, okay.

895
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,160
I think I'm dumb.

896
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,040
Ah, okay.

897
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,100
Please!

898
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,240
No, it won't let me jetpack again.

899
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:49,990
Oh, there we go.

900
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:50,850
Oh my gosh, finally.

901
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:53,890
Okay, okay.

902
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:55,070
Gimme.

903
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:56,510
There we go.

904
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,010
Sorry, collateral damage.

905
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:07,050
Oh my god, I thought that was Yoshi for a second.

906
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:09,830
That was it?

907
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,510
I was about to be like, no way.

908
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,350
How is that possible?

909
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:20,640
Gobo Defender.

910
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,440
Don't worry, he won't bite.

911
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,480
He looks like the...

912
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,720
The what's the word?

913
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,000
The game where you...

914
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,000
The game where you like...

915
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,780
Oh, thanks.

916
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,940
Where you...

917
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,140
Press down the teeth of the alligators.

918
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,420
That game, that game, that game.

919
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:58,630
I think I need these guys for this part.

920
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:03,750
I can't see!

921
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:04,610
I can't see!

922
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:12,570
No, not Hungry Hungry Hippos!

923
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,260
Not Hungry Hungry Hippos.

924
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:28,540
The one where you... Yeah, you press down the crocodile's teeth and then...

925
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:30,280
Eventually he bites somebody.

926
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,960
So close.

927
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,580
Oh my god.

928
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,680
It's so unsatisfying.

929
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,780
No

930
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,260
cactus allowed.

931
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:02,230
No cactus.

932
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:05,630
What is that sound I'm hearing?

933
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,120
Maybe it's coming from over here.

934
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,500
I did definitely kill that box.

935
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,460
I'm a sponge!

936
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,160
Nice!

937
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,180
I forgot how this one works.

938
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,860
A little bit more.

939
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,640
A little bit more.

940
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,240
Become big!

941
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,100
Okay, that doesn't do enough I guess.

942
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:45,800
More!

943
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:46,740
More!

944
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,320
More!

945
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,080
Retro Royale Dual Speeder.

946
01:00:59,360 --> 01:00:59,660
Cute!

947
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,580
Oh my gosh, look how cute they are!

948
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,500
I like that one.

949
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,320
He used to play that alligator game all the time as a kid.

950
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,060
Super popular game here in Florida.

951
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:16,070
I missed my friend Joel.

952
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,390
What happened to him?

953
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:19,290
I hope we find him.

954
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:33,060
I love being a big guy.

955
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:35,100
Oops.

956
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,580
What's wrong with me?

957
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:43,470
More please!

958
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:44,750
Thank you!

959
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:50,150
I can't control my own power everybody.

960
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:54,430
I can't control my power, my strength.

961
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:57,710
It's too much.

962
01:01:58,350 --> 01:01:59,890
Just way too much.

963
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:05,190
So if I do this...

964
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:07,710
Oh, cool.

965
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:11,970
What's this?

966
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:14,130
Yeah!

967
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:15,730
We got this guy!

968
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:18,230
We were needing him.

969
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,690
Where does this go to?

970
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:30,020
I guess if you probably didn't... Say you fell down...

971
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:36,080
Say you fell down and you couldn't get back up, but you didn't want to switch to that other guy.

972
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,380
Can I get in here?

973
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,320
Oh wait, I can roll in here.

974
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,300
I can get in here.

975
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,560
Oh, I can roll in here.

976
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:02,980
Is this the DLC?

977
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:03,820
It is!

978
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,480
Oh my god, I nearly burned to death.

979
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:25,960
Wrigley Wormonger.

980
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,060
Oh, is that the worm guy?

981
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:33,930
Armed and dangerous.

982
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,210
He's a worm, he shouldn't be armed.

983
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,460
He shouldn't be.

984
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:57,890
I like how all the characters in this game are like, look, look at the thing you got!

985
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:14,750
Neighborhood hero.

986
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:17,030
Friendly and amazing too.

987
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:19,690
That is so funny.

988
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:23,490
All of that for Spider-Man.

989
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:30,850
Oh my gosh, now it's night time!

990
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:32,610
And everything's glowing!

991
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:38,210
Oh my gosh, it's so beautiful!

992
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,090
It's so pretty!

993
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:47,270
Petition for Minto to play Earthworm Jim.

994
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,140
It's about worms.

995
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,880
What have I missed?

996
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:07,460
I got all the guys, so I guess anything I missed would be coins, right?

997
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:16,720
The Flying Santa.

998
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,300
I don't think it's possible to get to him, right?

999
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,160
I don't even know where he is.

1000
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:25,820
Santa?

1001
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,060
Top of the tree?

1002
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,440
Oh yeah, there was something at the top, wasn't there?

1003
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,180
What is that?

1004
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,320
What is up there?

1005
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,980
How do I get up there?

1006
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:56,200
I think maybe...

1007
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,900
Yeah, squid or chicken.

1008
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,200
Let's try the chicken first since it's right here.

1009
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,140
Quite honestly, I don't remember where the squid's at.

1010
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:14,060
Actually, I feel the squid might be better.

1011
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,160
Where was he at?

1012
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,440
Oh, he's all the way over there.

1013
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:29,170
Oh, that didn't work.

1014
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:31,790
Blacksmith, welcome to membership.

1015
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:32,550
Thank you!

1016
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,600
Take the rail.

1017
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,000
That's not like a smarter option.

1018
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,940
Oh yeah, it starts right here.

1019
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:46,720
I forgot.

1020
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,850
There's a thing at the top of the tree though.

1021
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:09,390
That's what we're trying to get everybody.

1022
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:13,530
We're trying to get the present at the top of the tree.

1023
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:17,330
And then after that I think I've gotten everything.

1024
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:31,730
Like this?

1025
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:34,850
Can I go any higher?

1026
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:36,590
Can we get much higher?

1027
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:45,210
I don't think I can... I don't know if I can go this way.

1028
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:47,330
Destroy it.

1029
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:48,110
I might die.

1030
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:00,920
The squid launcher.

1031
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:08,710
Oh, you guys are so right.

1032
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,670
What did I just destroy?

1033
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:14,290
Who did I just kill?

1034
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:17,250
Who did I just kill?

1035
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:20,510
I murdered a man.

1036
01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:21,930
Mama!

1037
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:28,660
Nice.

1038
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:31,800
And more.

1039
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,060
Oh my god.

1040
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,260
Somehow we made it.

1041
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,020
Why

1042
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:00,940
are his eyes doing that?

1043
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:01,340
Okay, whatever.

1044
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,200
There we go.

1045
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,160
Oh wait, I'm on Santa.

1046
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,960
What's wrong with that guy?

1047
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:22,840
Spaghetti-o.

1048
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,540
Who is that down there?

1049
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:28,280
If this is Santa...

1050
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,400
Who's that?

1051
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:37,470
If this is Santa...

1052
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:39,550
Who's that down there?

1053
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:41,890
Right there.

1054
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:50,380
Liquid Santa.

1055
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:05,100
Stupid alien.

1056
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:10,000
It's a little suspicious I'd say.

1057
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,440
A little suspicious.

1058
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:18,700
Nice.

1059
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,000
Yeah, he's over there.

1060
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:26,750
Made my stomach drop.

1061
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:28,590
Papa!

1062
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:51,680
Santa!

1063
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,240
Spider-Man Christmas level.

1064
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:58,940
It's so funny.

1065
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,920
I can't believe it.

1066
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:09,160
I have 279 out of 317.

1067
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,660
Oh, the DLC was just so sweet.

1068
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,660
It was so cute.

1069
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,520
There's some like... Oh, did we even do this one?

1070
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,480
At all?

1071
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:21,900
No!

1072
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,240
There's like some levels that I still haven't even touched.

1073
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,280
There's so much to this game.

1074
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,740
So much to this game.

1075
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,120
10 in the speedrun levels.

1076
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:44,720
I'm not sure if, you know...

1077
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,000
There we go.

1078
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,040
There we go.

1079
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,220
There we go.

1080
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:55,860
Nice.

1081
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,480
How do you... Oh yeah.

1082
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,100
I remember doing a speedrun level and I just didn't even see it.

1083
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,700
I just didn't even see anybody.

1084
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:09,980
Tribal flag bearer.

1085
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,280
Marches to the beat of an almighty drummer.

1086
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,300
When did I put this on?

1087
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:24,600
Oh my god, there's so much litter in the ocean.

1088
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,820
This is so sad.

1089
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:35,430
Clean up!

1090
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:35,930
Clean up!

1091
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,080
Oh.

1092
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,180
No, that's not what I meant to do.

1093
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:52,650
Oh, I got it?

1094
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:53,970
Wait, he put it on?

1095
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:56,270
I was a monkey for so long, I didn't even notice.

1096
01:12:57,810 --> 01:12:59,270
I was a monkey so long.

1097
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:02,270
I know when I got it, but I didn't realize I put it on immediately.

1098
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:03,470
That's so funny.

1099
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:13,450
Oh, nasty sludge man.

1100
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:18,330
Ew.

1101
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:22,360
Disgusting.

1102
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:24,080
Disgusting sludge.

1103
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:30,380
How do I put an end to your sludgeness?

1104
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,220
There we go.

1105
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:38,740
Nasty.

1106
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,560
Oh, hello.

1107
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:47,980
Nice.

1108
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:51,620
Oh, sorry.

1109
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,600
I almost abandoned this guy.

1110
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,060
I almost just left him stranded.

1111
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,020
Guys, we missed one.

1112
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,000
We missed one.

1113
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,680
Where is he?

1114
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:12,840
You did abandon a guy.

1115
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:13,900
No!

1116
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,240
He sunk to the ocean!

1117
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:17,600
I'm coming to get ya!

1118
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,900
Oh, the current pushes me back.

1119
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:24,200
No!

1120
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,620
OK, we'll come back.

1121
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,120
We'll just redo the level.

1122
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,360
We'll find him.

1123
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,000
I believe.

1124
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,840
Trust, trust, trust, trust, trust.

1125
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:42,160
There we go.

1126
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,500
It was near the start?

1127
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,940
I don't know if that's good or bad.

1128
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,300
That I missed him, but I didn't even notice him.

1129
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,300
Love my little insignificant guys.

1130
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,420
Oh my goodness.

1131
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,140
When you come...

1132
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,560
Didn't even give him a second to breathe.

1133
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,640
Neither of these guys.

1134
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:31,880
All of them dead.

1135
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:31,920
Dead.

1136
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,120
All of them dead, dead, dead, dead.

1137
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:38,080
What's this?

1138
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,500
What is this?

1139
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,520
Stop the oil.

1140
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:51,060
I wonder why this ducky has so much water in him.

1141
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:51,660
Is he OK?

1142
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,760
Should this not open?

1143
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,280
Yeah.

1144
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:04,010
Oh look, we become a mermaid.

1145
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:04,810
Oh Santa.

1146
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:09,570
It looks so stupid with the...

1147
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:14,290
With the beard and the mustache, it looks so dumb.

1148
01:16:15,090 --> 01:16:15,850
I love it.

1149
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:17,130
How do I get up here?

1150
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,350
All the way back around.

1151
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,170
No, no, no.

1152
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:51,340
I'm not tall enough.

1153
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,920
I'm not tall enough.

1154
01:16:58,110 --> 01:17:00,730
Is this supposed to activate?

1155
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,620
Stupid.

1156
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:12,800
Oh my god.

1157
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:20,980
Nice.

1158
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,940
Overcooked a little.

1159
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,400
It's been a minute since I played the game.

1160
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,280
It's all good, it's all good.

1161
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,120
Nice.

1162
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:37,420
Alright, let's make sure we don't leave anyone behind.

1163
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,140
Do you hear any screams?

1164
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,360
Any cries?

1165
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:45,720
Oh no, that's me.

1166
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,500
That's my own cries.

1167
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:48,820
Of loneliness.

1168
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:56,360
The controller has a nice set of thighs.

1169
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,500
I love ancient anime girl figures.

1170
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,380
I'm not the only one that thought it.

1171
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:18,000
How do I... How do I get to you?

1172
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:19,800
Wait, I see a guy up there.

1173
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,500
And he's flossing.

1174
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,000
Another Patapon.

1175
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:38,460
What is Patapon?

1176
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:41,700
Keeps one eye on their enemies.

1177
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:50,570
It's a puzzle game.

1178
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,160
Got him.

1179
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,340
Easy peasy.

1180
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,540
Has a serious beat.

1181
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:17,500
Suck up!

1182
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:18,880
Suck, suck, suck!

1183
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,360
Everybody suck!

1184
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,240
Do your part and suck!

1185
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:23,520
Suck!

1186
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:25,780
I can't be the only one sucking here, okay?

1187
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,520
We all have to do our part.

1188
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,000
We all have to do our part!

1189
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,820
Do your part!

1190
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:37,100
I don't quite understand.

1191
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,580
I just keep sucking.

1192
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,080
Just keep sucking.

1193
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:44,360
Everybody do your part!

1194
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,060
That was so easy.

1195
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,280
Patapon was a sort of rhythm and strategy game for the PSP.

1196
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,000
It's pretty fun.

1197
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,600
It sounds so cute.

1198
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:22,630
The moral is...

1199
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:23,610
Never stop sucking.

1200
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:28,030
It's okay to suck!

1201
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:30,510
It's okay to suck!

1202
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,470
There is a new one coming out called Ratatat.

1203
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,340
I should have left you dirty.

1204
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,880
I should have left you dirty, turtle.

1205
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:48,040
Hold on, we got to go get...

1206
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:51,000
What's this?

1207
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:52,840
Wait, hold on.

1208
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,820
I want to get this guy real quick.

1209
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,760
I want to get this guy real quick.

1210
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,500
YouTuber, try not to say sussy.

1211
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:02,180
I'm telling you, what is that?

1212
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:05,480
I mean, like sucking...

1213
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,520
Oh my god.

1214
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,940
It's not even a sussy thing.

1215
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:09,840
It's saying like...

1216
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,720
You know, when someone is like, you suck.

1217
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,640
It's not sussy.

1218
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,600
Only you're making it sussy.

1219
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:26,070
You made it sussy.

1220
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:38,520
I see him!

1221
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:45,230
I see you!

1222
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:47,510
Normal guy.

1223
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:50,890
Little lame-o over here.

1224
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,870
The actual moral is to not litter.

1225
01:21:58,030 --> 01:21:58,870
So true!

1226
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:02,230
Yay!

1227
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:05,170
It said those thighs were...

1228
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,250
They were nice thighs.

1229
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:09,650
I wasn't the only one thinking that either.

1230
01:22:09,790 --> 01:22:10,390
I'm just saying.

1231
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,070
So what is this now?

1232
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:16,390
Final Encore.

1233
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:23,450
No, the moral is kill octopuses?

1234
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:25,450
Can't we have more than one moral?

1235
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:27,830
This looks a little freaky.

1236
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,360
OK.

1237
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:57,400
It is.

1238
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:58,820
The Clapper.

1239
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,700
Wake up!

1240
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:09,390
Oh my god.

1241
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:10,570
That's a lot of monkeys!

1242
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,740
That's a lot of monkeys!

1243
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,140
300k vtuber not sus.

1244
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:22,580
Heard that before.

1245
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:23,680
What are you talking about, eh?

1246
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:25,880
What were we trying to say, eh?

1247
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:50,340
We activate them.

1248
01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:01,310
Oh my gosh, big duckies.

1249
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:05,690
Oh my god, the bushes are little ribbons.

1250
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:06,570
This is so cute.

1251
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:08,550
Look at all of them.

1252
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:10,770
Is this Madagascar's sequel?

1253
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:12,530
Might as well be, right?

1254
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:17,470
Can't resist.

1255
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:26,860
Good job, good job.

1256
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,120
I got you!

1257
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:28,860
Who is this?

1258
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:29,720
Who are you?

1259
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:32,840
That will determine my enthusiasm.

1260
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,880
Classical conductor.

1261
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:36,980
Excellent at conducting under pressure.

1262
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:37,520
Who is this?

1263
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,440
Who is that?

1264
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,380
Dummy.

1265
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,000
Nice hat, nerd.

1266
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,760
I'm Santa!

1267
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:59,520
Thank you for the 50 gift!

1268
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:00,400
Thank you!

1269
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:04,180
Wait, how did I die?

1270
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:05,440
Who killed me?

1271
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,440
Oh, it's these guys.

1272
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:16,800
I didn't even notice them on me.

1273
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:23,910
I didn't notice them on me.

1274
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:24,730
My bad.

1275
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:29,430
Thank you so much for the 50 gift!

1276
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:33,050
Hold on.

1277
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:33,810
Hold on.

1278
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:34,150
Sorry.

1279
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:34,770
Hold on.

1280
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:35,310
Sorry.

1281
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:37,370
Goal!

1282
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:38,410
Goal!

1283
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:45,990
I thought he killed me at first.

1284
01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:48,210
I thought it was that guy.

1285
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:52,610
Thank you for the 50 gift!

1286
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:53,730
What's happening?

1287
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:56,990
Check left.

1288
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:01,230
I hear someone snoring.

1289
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:02,410
Something.

1290
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,540
But I did see...

1291
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,560
This is... Is that guy the one that's snoring?

1292
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,620
Dang it, I missed it.

1293
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:27,620
I forgot he woke up.

1294
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:32,290
Nice!

1295
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:36,350
Nice!

1296
01:26:38,410 --> 01:26:40,650
And twisty, twisty, twisty!

1297
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:55,630
How do I get it right every time?

1298
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:56,410
I think I'm a genius.

1299
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:59,010
You guys will never know my secret.

1300
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:04,890
I also read that wrong.

1301
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:06,690
I

1302
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:12,220
thought that was Kazuhira Miller.

1303
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:15,460
I definitely read that wrong.

1304
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:22,390
Singing isn't a sport, it's a battle.

1305
01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:28,750
I think we're all on the same page there.

1306
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:29,250
Maybe.

1307
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:37,250
Maybe we're all on the same page in what we accidentally read incorrectly, I think.

1308
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:37,710
Maybe.

1309
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:40,090
Say what?

1310
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:43,590
Wow!

1311
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:45,110
Oh my god, stop.

1312
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:46,790
This is so fun!

1313
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:50,570
Oh my gosh, this is so fun.

1314
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,580
Yeah, I know what to do.

1315
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,680
I'm just scared of doing it.

1316
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:04,920
Oh my god.

1317
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:05,680
Wait.

1318
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:06,520
Hold on.

1319
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:07,600
Let me get through here.

1320
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:11,860
The one that... What the heck?

1321
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,320
Thank you for the Haka Soba!

1322
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:19,440
Hey Mito, is the Conan named after every famous literary Conan here?

1323
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,040
Can I get a happy birthday?

1324
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,760
I have a day early so I have...

1325
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:26,140
But I have work until actually tomorrow so I won't be able to make it to any streams.

1326
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:28,060
Conan!

1327
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,820
Can I say Conan instead of your username?

1328
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:42,410
Happy birthday to you.

1329
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:45,510
Happy birthday to you.

1330
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:48,890
Happy birthday dear Conan.

1331
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:55,730
Happy birthday to you.

1332
01:28:57,410 --> 01:29:00,890
There is only one truth.

1333
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:02,910
Where are we going?

1334
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:07,030
You can't resist.

1335
01:29:08,230 --> 01:29:09,990
You can't resist.

1336
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:18,030
You can't resist.

1337
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:20,370
Eggnog got me into a gifting mood.

1338
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:21,210
Merry Christmas Mito.

1339
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:23,090
Merry Christmas to all you fellow Wisps.

1340
01:29:23,450 --> 01:29:24,470
Peace and love to all.

1341
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:25,790
What the heck?

1342
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:27,910
But there he goes!

1343
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:29,150
Thank you!

1344
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:31,010
Stop!

1345
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:31,170
Stop!

1346
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:34,810
Stop it!

1347
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:39,470
Too much eggnog!

1348
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:41,850
Too much eggnog maybe.

1349
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:43,370
Too much eggnog.

1350
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:44,610
Please!

1351
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:46,810
That was close.

1352
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:51,700
Don't!

1353
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:52,580
Don't!

1354
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:54,220
Don't do it if you can't do it!

1355
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:57,360
Don't do it if you can't do it!

1356
01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:01,770
Thank you so much!

1357
01:30:02,590 --> 01:30:03,910
How do I use this thing again?

1358
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:05,670
Oops.

1359
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:06,790
Oops.

1360
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:08,830
Oops.

1361
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:12,570
Oops.

1362
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:13,330
Oops.

1363
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:16,330
Oops.

1364
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:17,910
OK, hold on.

1365
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:28,830
I think I did that same mistake before.

1366
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:31,970
Don't worry, the company bonus is coming in strong.

1367
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:32,310
No!

1368
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:34,450
Please!

1369
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:37,490
OK,

1370
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:47,710
I did it.

1371
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:48,950
I did it for real.

1372
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,450
You guys don't...

1373
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,770
Shut up.

1374
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:58,250
Shut the front door.

1375
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:03,900
It's a fall guy!

1376
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,040
How's he beating?

1377
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,200
Able to overcome all obstacles.

1378
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:09,940
What?

1379
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:12,660
It's a fall guy!

1380
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:16,260
That's crazy!

1381
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:19,340
No way!

1382
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:26,780
There we go.

1383
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:33,680
What's up here?

1384
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,180
Nice.

1385
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,200
Nice.

1386
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:41,440
Nice.

1387
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:42,880
Nice.

1388
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:45,640
Big money.

1389
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:58,000
That's so evil.

1390
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,900
That's so evil.

1391
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:06,770
It's OK, we got him.

1392
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:10,130
What the heck is this?

1393
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:16,940
Have I missed any guys?

1394
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:17,660
No.

1395
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:25,030
I was gonna call him a bean, but I wasn't sure if that was his official title.

1396
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:28,830
Good to know that it is.

1397
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:30,250
He's just a bean.

1398
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,680
What's that thing down there?

1399
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:41,240
Wait, I hear a guy.

1400
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:42,300
I hear someone.

1401
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,420
Oh wait, maybe that was me calling into the void.

1402
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:45,740
I'm not sure.

1403
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:02,360
So close.

1404
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:05,280
I almost didn't want to save him.

1405
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:06,800
I hate the fall guys.

1406
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:09,120
Hit that again.

1407
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:12,560
That's not because I'm bad at it.

1408
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:19,820
At Tokyo Game Show, I placed... I placed... I placed first.

1409
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:23,060
No, I don't think I... Actually I don't know, but I don't remember if I was first.

1410
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:28,580
I placed... I placed top 5 in the Sonic Rumble.

1411
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:31,140
It's not me.

1412
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,140
I'm good at the game.

1413
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:35,280
No!

1414
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:38,020
It's the truth.

1415
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,920
Oh my god, there are so many guys here.

1416
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,300
There are so many...

1417
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,720
Oh, just kidding.

1418
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:02,090
Whatever you say, Mindo.

1419
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:02,650
It's true!

1420
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:06,410
Amateur vocalist, always down for a duet.

1421
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:09,990
I didn't see you.

1422
01:34:10,130 --> 01:34:10,510
OK, good.

1423
01:34:11,410 --> 01:34:11,890
Perfect.

1424
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:20,250
One thing I love so much about all these levels is they are just all so pretty.

1425
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:24,290
They are all so aesthetically pleasing to look at.

1426
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:30,660
I'm not bad at the game!

1427
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:35,020
It wasn't me, you know?

1428
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,380
Prove it!

1429
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,320
I don't need to prove it!

1430
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:50,040
I don't need to prove it!

1431
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:51,240
I don't like the game!

1432
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:54,580
There we go.

1433
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:57,460
Oh god.

1434
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,100
I

1435
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,000
think these are little poops.

1436
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:08,340
No?

1437
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:09,220
They are money?

1438
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:11,200
Is it all money?

1439
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:13,000
Oh, it's all money!

1440
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:15,120
Is it all money?

1441
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,740
Why is all this money spinning?

1442
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,880
That's all I needed to do.

1443
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:34,260
Oops, all money.

1444
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:41,440
Get off the stage!

1445
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:43,660
Oh shit.

1446
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:51,000
Well now I know I can do this.

1447
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,680
There we go, we get all the money.

1448
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,300
Next membership stream for all guys.

1449
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,280
I don't even know if I still have the game, honestly.

1450
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:06,820
Get off the stage!

1451
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:12,760
Let me play a real song for you.

1452
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:25,220
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle...

1453
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:42,420
Let's try to see who was negative!

1454
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,460
OK, ready?

1455
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:16,940
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

1456
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:37,070
There we go.

1457
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:39,970
Thank you for the so many...

1458
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:41,450
Thank you.

1459
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:50,540
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

1460
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:50,840
What?

1461
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:51,620
How many subnets?

1462
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,840
Thank you.

1463
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,440
OK, anyway.

1464
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,240
Don't worry about it.

1465
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:23,610
Oh my god.

1466
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:24,830
What?

1467
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:28,010
Oh, I just realized there is another path!

1468
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:31,730
Oh my gosh, guys.

1469
01:38:31,790 --> 01:38:32,530
We are fine.

1470
01:38:32,930 --> 01:38:34,410
Don't worry about it.

1471
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,960
I didn't see it.

1472
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,800
I was so busy focused on...

1473
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:47,240
I was so busy focused on the electric guy.

1474
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:59,210
I didn't get all of it, but that's OK.

1475
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:04,410
Die!

1476
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:12,420
Tommy!

1477
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:27,980
Please fall guys.

1478
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:29,580
I just want to show my skill to you.

1479
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:32,000
No, because nobody ever lets me win!

1480
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,000
Nobody ever lets me win!

1481
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:40,780
You are supposed to be like, I want my Oshi to win, you know?

1482
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:45,140
It would be so awesome to see her get a W.

1483
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:49,520
It's all...

1484
01:40:00,590 --> 01:40:01,450
Oh my gosh!

1485
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:02,310
Space Santa 5!

1486
01:40:04,930 --> 01:40:05,690
Oh my gosh, stop.

1487
01:40:05,770 --> 01:40:06,490
She is so cute.

1488
01:40:10,190 --> 01:40:11,190
Lost and found.

1489
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:13,750
Groovy reporter!

1490
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:16,310
Up, down, left, right, two, two, two!

1491
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,460
You better not floss.

1492
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:41,640
Watch the fall, guys.

1493
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:43,520
I knew he was gonna floss!

1494
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,620
I knew that, asshole!

1495
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:48,440
I called it.

1496
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:50,700
I knew it was gonna be fall, guys.

1497
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:51,660
I would be flossing.

1498
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:53,060
I knew it!

1499
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:54,340
He is the type!

1500
01:40:57,980 --> 01:41:00,500
He is the type to do it!

1501
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:07,400
It feels weird to have fall guys in this.

1502
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:10,320
I mean, it wasn't exclusive or anything.

1503
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:14,740
But it was originally... Was it originally Steam?

1504
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,480
It was PC, right?

1505
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:25,180
One, two...

1506
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:26,960
Three.

1507
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,620
Oh my gosh, I know where this guy is.

1508
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:34,360
We might be able to 100% all of these levels though.

1509
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:41,610
I think it launched on PlayStation Plus.

1510
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:45,810
I see, I see.

1511
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:48,470
Makes sense.

1512
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:50,650
Gotcha, break.

1513
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:54,870
Look at all my guys!

1514
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,380
We are almost to 300.

1515
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:07,740
And we are almost to finishing.

1516
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:09,320
I wanna finish that today.

1517
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:10,280
For sure.

1518
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:13,280
I wanna finish that today.

1519
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:14,020
For sure.

1520
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:22,880
Rallying banner.

1521
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:25,740
As bearer speaks for a higher power.

1522
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:28,800
What's this?

1523
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:31,400
Maestro's podium.

1524
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:39,660
Spiky pole!

1525
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,340
He is so funny looking.

1526
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:47,220
TV attic essentials.

1527
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:50,300
Look, he is watching himself.

1528
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:52,020
What a narcissist.

1529
01:42:57,660 --> 01:42:59,820
Money well spent trophy.

1530
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:01,320
Oh, fun!

1531
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:02,680
Dizzying disc.

1532
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:09,710
Why is he sitting like that?

1533
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:11,970
Little discord kitten you.

1534
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:16,930
Oh, are you allowed to do that, Peter?

1535
01:43:17,290 --> 01:43:18,070
Sorry, not Peter.

1536
01:43:18,170 --> 01:43:18,530
Spider-Man?

1537
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:24,410
Naughty oinker.

1538
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:28,690
That's why I'm gonna start calling you guys.

1539
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:31,210
Doxxed!

1540
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:32,170
Sorry!

1541
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:33,610
I'll delete the bot!

1542
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:36,830
Turn singers into stars!

1543
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:44,890
Did you guys know that Karaoke Revolution has Snake Eater on it?

1544
01:43:46,110 --> 01:43:47,090
Pet carrier.

1545
01:43:48,390 --> 01:43:49,830
Where is the pet?

1546
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:52,650
So cute!

1547
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:58,350
So cute!

1548
01:44:01,810 --> 01:44:03,130
Spaghetti.

1549
01:44:05,130 --> 01:44:06,570
Great to hang out with.

1550
01:44:06,690 --> 01:44:07,170
Swink ring.

1551
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,840
Oh god.

1552
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:16,680
This is horrifying.

1553
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:19,480
I don't like that one.

1554
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:22,460
Stinking worms.

1555
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:25,720
Tribal fuzzball.

1556
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:29,100
Fed up being mistaken for a coconut.

1557
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:36,220
Arrow flinger.

1558
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:38,980
You don't even have any arrows.

1559
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,840
And last one that we got.

1560
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:45,560
Reporter's mic.

1561
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:46,720
Oh my god, stop.

1562
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:48,260
She is so cute.

1563
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:50,780
Look at her go.

1564
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:00,860
Find more special bots or puzzle pieces.

1565
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:01,540
Okay.

1566
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:06,510
Let's change out of Santa.

1567
01:45:07,630 --> 01:45:12,150
In fact, I'm going to change into... Wait, who did I... What just updated?

1568
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:17,950
What?

1569
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:19,130
They're at the top!

1570
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:21,030
That's so fun.

1571
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:25,030
I wanna change maybe.

1572
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:26,970
We've got some new outfits too.

1573
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:32,710
Oh yeah, this one.

1574
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:33,270
It's me.

1575
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,760
I like the skelly man too.

1576
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:44,920
Wait, we're missing one.

1577
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:51,520
Must be one of the guys that we haven't gotten yet.

1578
01:45:56,110 --> 01:45:57,150
Where is everybody?

1579
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:58,790
Where are they?

1580
01:46:00,990 --> 01:46:02,550
Look at my army.

1581
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:20,740
They're saying it!

1582
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:21,480
They're saying it!

1583
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:43,750
They're so cute.

1584
01:46:43,890 --> 01:46:44,470
There she is.

1585
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:46,710
What do you do?

1586
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,960
He is so cute.

1587
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:12,840
He's got it.

1588
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:13,580
He's got the spirit.

1589
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:17,260
Thank you.

1590
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:24,940
How am I supposed to... Hold on, Rayman.

1591
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:25,540
Come here, come here.

1592
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:26,380
Come here, Rayman.

1593
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:27,200
Rayman!

1594
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:28,140
There we go.

1595
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:32,820
Cute.

1596
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,860
Wait, what's this one?

1597
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:38,760
I haven't done it yet.

1598
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:44,940
My precious.

1599
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,260
There's a couple of you that I haven't...

1600
01:47:59,870 --> 01:48:00,970
We can enroll.

1601
01:48:01,390 --> 01:48:01,810
Dodge!

1602
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:07,930
You died.

1603
01:48:08,410 --> 01:48:09,030
Can you imagine?

1604
01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:13,090
When you die, they should have the text come up above him.

1605
01:48:13,670 --> 01:48:15,110
That would have been really good.

1606
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:25,200
Alright, shall we go 100%?

1607
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:29,260
Those secret levels, so we can just have all of those 100%ed.

1608
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:31,020
Oh wait, hold on.

1609
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:33,560
Before we do that...

1610
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:38,200
Oh, I think the...

1611
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:41,980
I think the last puzzle pieces are all the way on the other side.

1612
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:45,540
Then we'll work on getting more puzzle pieces.

1613
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:52,260
Yeah, then we'll work on getting more puzzle pieces and I'll try and finish that one thing.

1614
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:59,560
There's a few puzzle pieces even in here that we haven't gotten, so...

1615
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:01,540
Like this one!

1616
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:02,180
Perfect!

1617
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,200
Hopefully it's towards the beginning.

1618
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:07,760
Maybe.

1619
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:11,680
Maybe.

1620
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:28,660
It's almost towards the end.

1621
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,160
Did I...

1622
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:35,770
Shall we recruit Birdie?

1623
01:49:36,330 --> 01:49:38,070
I was going to say, I think so.

1624
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:40,670
I don't want to accidentally miss it.

1625
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:44,050
It's OK, we'll make the money back, I think.

1626
01:49:47,030 --> 01:49:48,430
We'll make the money back.

1627
01:49:49,690 --> 01:49:50,730
Come on, Bird!

1628
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:56,160
Oh, that's right!

1629
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:57,160
OK, thank you game.

1630
01:49:57,860 --> 01:49:59,680
I couldn't remember how it worked.

1631
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,020
Oh, no!

1632
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:03,900
Wait, wait, wait!

1633
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:15,840
I hate this life.

1634
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:20,920
I couldn't find any good deals for the MGS collection.

1635
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:24,000
Here's a key for chat for revengeance.

1636
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,120
K.K.!

1637
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,060
I didn't have to do that.

1638
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:46,940
Nice.

1639
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,540
Nice.

1640
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:53,040
Alright, Bird.

1641
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:55,360
Tell us when we're close, Bird.

1642
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,760
Tell us when we're close, Bird.

1643
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:00,080
Come on, Bird.

1644
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,680
Tell us when we're close, Bird.

1645
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,940
Bird, tell us when we're close, Bird.

1646
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:11,980
Bird...

1647
01:51:13,730 --> 01:51:14,970
I've got to be careful.

1648
01:51:17,910 --> 01:51:19,310
OK, there was something there.

1649
01:51:19,850 --> 01:51:20,470
There was a guy.

1650
01:51:27,150 --> 01:51:28,730
He's not signaled yet.

1651
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:31,410
So far...

1652
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:32,890
So good.

1653
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:39,510
So far, so good.

1654
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:41,130
I think.

1655
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:42,550
Oh my god.

1656
01:51:42,650 --> 01:51:43,250
Wait, hold on.

1657
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:44,550
I was itching my nose.

1658
01:51:45,390 --> 01:51:46,310
Itching my nose!

1659
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:49,410
Please, give me a moment...

1660
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:50,850
of rest!

1661
01:51:56,630 --> 01:51:59,510
That was another...

1662
01:52:00,590 --> 01:52:01,370
puzzle piece.

1663
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:05,410
Just hit pause.

1664
01:52:05,570 --> 01:52:06,990
Pause is for...

1665
01:52:08,630 --> 01:52:10,510
Pause is for...

1666
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:12,330
I'm a gamer!

1667
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:12,890
Gamer!

1668
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:13,910
We don't hit pause!

1669
01:52:16,710 --> 01:52:17,270
Wait.

1670
01:52:18,890 --> 01:52:19,730
Up there?

1671
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:21,490
Is it up there, Bird?

1672
01:52:22,370 --> 01:52:23,250
Is it up there?

1673
01:52:36,070 --> 01:52:36,630
Nice.

1674
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:45,530
Now this one...

1675
01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:46,750
is also a puzzle piece.

1676
01:52:46,830 --> 01:52:47,070
Perfect.

1677
01:52:49,390 --> 01:52:50,730
100% baby.

1678
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,580
I thought that's where we were landing.

1679
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:08,400
I almost made back the money.

1680
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:09,620
Almost.

1681
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:15,040
Alright.

1682
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:17,080
It says it's towards the...

1683
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:19,600
Rather it's the first one, so...

1684
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:21,860
This one is pretty early.

1685
01:53:21,860 --> 01:53:21,940
Really?

1686
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:26,520
He hasn't gone off yet.

1687
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:30,060
So...

1688
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:33,560
Making big money though.

1689
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:37,040
Big money.

1690
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:39,760
Snake.

1691
01:53:57,450 --> 01:53:58,590
I'm listening.

1692
01:53:58,770 --> 01:54:00,090
I'm on the...

1693
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:03,170
Oh, I think he...

1694
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:08,810
Eeee.

1695
01:54:10,270 --> 01:54:11,730
Oh, I forgot.

1696
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:16,230
Is there out here this?

1697
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:17,170
Right?

1698
01:54:22,290 --> 01:54:23,810
It's not in here.

1699
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:25,190
I don't think.

1700
01:54:25,710 --> 01:54:26,810
Hey, happy holidays!

1701
01:54:28,030 --> 01:54:29,570
Did you ever notice the sound like...

1702
01:54:31,690 --> 01:54:33,470
Feeling low from regret.

1703
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:36,670
Don't go down!

1704
01:54:40,210 --> 01:54:40,770
What?

1705
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:52,550
I got too distracted by feeling low comment.

1706
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:02,340
I got too distracted by feeling low comment.

1707
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:02,860
It's OK.

1708
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:03,400
It's free.

1709
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:05,060
It's free.

1710
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:08,900
Do I get to keep the money that I just made?

1711
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:13,780
I think I did, right?

1712
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:15,620
We're just making more money.

1713
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:17,320
My bad.

1714
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:18,080
No, you're fine.

1715
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:20,620
I

1716
01:55:23,710 --> 01:55:25,950
don't know why everyone thinks I sound like them.

1717
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:27,710
I don't get it.

1718
01:55:28,530 --> 01:55:31,490
I don't know why everyone thinks I sound like them.

1719
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:33,410
I don't understand.

1720
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,020
Try saying Lillian.

1721
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:45,460
Lillian.

1722
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:47,940
Lillian.

1723
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:48,620
Lillian.

1724
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:52,420
Lillian.

1725
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,560
So it's up here.

1726
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:54,980
Ah!

1727
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:00,060
Lillian.

1728
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:05,580
Who's Lillian?

1729
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:11,440
Izzy!

1730
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:17,940
Yippee!

1731
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,260
OK.

1732
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:25,080
And then our last one I think is a guy.

1733
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:27,240
Oh wait.

1734
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:27,600
Oh no.

1735
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:28,440
It's the puzzle piece.

1736
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:30,020
But I know exactly where it is.

1737
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:32,000
It's at the very end of the level.

1738
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:35,820
But I know where it is because I remember when I missed it.

1739
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,140
I know where it is.

1740
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:41,000
I don't need the bird.

1741
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:42,740
I don't need the bird.

1742
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:51,290
What's in here?

1743
01:56:55,570 --> 01:56:56,010
Money.

1744
01:56:57,090 --> 01:56:58,370
We'll make our money back.

1745
01:56:59,910 --> 01:57:00,350
Maybe.

1746
01:57:01,830 --> 01:57:02,270
Oh.

1747
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:09,780
Noice.

1748
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:12,060
But it's at the very end of the level.

1749
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:16,160
Oh.

1750
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:22,540
Holy moly.

1751
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:27,890
Wake up!

1752
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:33,470
OK.

1753
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:39,120
OK.

1754
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:41,440
We don't need to go that way.

1755
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:42,200
We go this way.

1756
01:57:42,820 --> 01:57:43,860
And then the fake out.

1757
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:53,400
OK.

1758
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:54,540
OK.

1759
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:54,840
Noice.

1760
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:18,300
The music is so good for this game.

1761
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:19,600
It's so cute, right?

1762
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:21,980
I love this game.

1763
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:22,740
It's so silly.

1764
01:58:28,690 --> 01:58:29,250
Okidoki.

1765
01:58:29,950 --> 01:58:30,590
What a gamer.

1766
01:58:30,910 --> 01:58:31,230
I know.

1767
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:35,270
Oh there it

1768
01:58:47,970 --> 01:58:48,150
is.

1769
01:59:07,890 --> 01:59:08,450
Noice.

1770
01:59:11,850 --> 01:59:12,410
Wait.

1771
01:59:12,510 --> 01:59:13,430
This guy is a fake?

1772
01:59:14,070 --> 01:59:14,850
This guy is a fake?

1773
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:41,840
OK.

1774
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:43,160
I'm pretty sure...

1775
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:43,320
Oh.

1776
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:46,440
You son of a...

1777
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:47,900
You stinking...

1778
01:59:56,820 --> 01:59:57,940
Quit smoking.

1779
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:03,700
Quit being so smoking.

1780
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:05,620
Oh my god.

1781
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:09,600
Please!

1782
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:12,940
I can't...

1783
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:13,560
Alright.

1784
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:16,480
Now I think it's there.

1785
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:21,800
Told you guys I knew where it was.

1786
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:26,520
Told you guys I knew where it was!

1787
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:34,900
I don't think my mic is muted because...

1788
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:35,780
I don't know.

1789
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:37,360
I just spat all over my mic though.

1790
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:42,910
I spat all over it.

1791
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:45,060
Yaaay!

1792
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:47,600
And with that...

1793
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:51,600
All of our secret levels...

1794
02:00:52,620 --> 02:00:54,540
Are completed!

1795
02:00:58,860 --> 02:00:59,760
Yeah!

1796
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:03,120
Let's see how many more puzzle pieces we need.

1797
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:06,480
Should have been me.

1798
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:07,860
It could be you.

1799
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:12,820
Never say... Don't let your dreams be dreams.

1800
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:17,780
Four more.

1801
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:18,080
OK.

1802
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:18,960
Four more.

1803
02:01:22,550 --> 02:01:23,110
Wait.

1804
02:01:23,990 --> 02:01:24,330
No.

1805
02:01:25,030 --> 02:01:26,010
We must be festive.

1806
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:35,940
I'm missing...

1807
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:36,980
One?

1808
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:43,080
You also need a lot more bots.

1809
02:01:43,140 --> 02:01:44,960
Yeah, but I'm not 100%ing that part today.

1810
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:47,960
I just want to 100% the...

1811
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:49,720
The puzzle.

1812
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:53,420
I wouldn't say a lot more.

1813
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:55,200
Oh wait, you didn't even say a lot.

1814
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:56,460
I just inserted that.

1815
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:58,160
I'm so sorry, Erickson.

1816
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:03,720
I do need more bots.

1817
02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:05,080
You are absolutely correct.

1818
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:11,280
Self-deprecation.

1819
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:12,360
Truly.

1820
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:16,440
We just need one more and then we got the gorilla.

1821
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:17,840
OK, it's this one.

1822
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:21,600
We need one more.

1823
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:23,500
I think I can do this.

1824
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:25,400
And then the gorilla is complete.

1825
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:26,740
100% complete.

1826
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:34,040
Do you think we should buy the bird?

1827
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:37,660
Think we should buy the bird?

1828
02:02:44,150 --> 02:02:44,630
No?

1829
02:02:45,810 --> 02:02:47,010
Are you gonna help me get it then?

1830
02:02:50,090 --> 02:02:51,050
Are you gonna help me?

1831
02:02:51,510 --> 02:02:52,910
Are you gonna help me get it then?

1832
02:02:53,350 --> 02:02:56,190
If I don't buy the bird, are you gonna help me?

1833
02:02:57,890 --> 02:02:58,810
Do you need it?

1834
02:02:58,850 --> 02:03:00,070
I don't know where it is.

1835
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:02,630
No help.

1836
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:03,390
Why?

1837
02:03:03,490 --> 02:03:05,210
You guys help me all the time.

1838
02:03:06,070 --> 02:03:07,110
Stop being so tsundere.

1839
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:12,470
Stop being so tsundere.

1840
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:14,670
You guys help me all the time.

1841
02:03:16,490 --> 02:03:17,910
We don't help you.

1842
02:03:19,570 --> 02:03:20,650
Yeah, OK.

1843
02:03:21,530 --> 02:03:22,930
No help, they said.

1844
02:03:23,950 --> 02:03:26,010
No help, they said.

1845
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:28,310
I may help all the time.

1846
02:03:31,170 --> 02:03:32,650
OK, no more help.

1847
02:03:33,150 --> 02:03:34,590
OK, I'm gonna go get the bird.

1848
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:40,420
No help, B-B-B-Backer.

1849
02:03:55,020 --> 02:03:56,480
This guy will definitely help.

1850
02:03:57,960 --> 02:04:00,700
You guys are just saying no help for free.

1851
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:02,780
What do I have to pay you?

1852
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:05,780
I have to pay this bird 200 gold coins.

1853
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:06,920
Can you give me a better deal?

1854
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,460
Why should I choose you over the bird?

1855
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:10,320
What?

1856
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:13,920
How much would you be?

1857
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:24,300
It's not really within my budget, but I think I can make it work.

1858
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:27,680
I think I can make it work.

1859
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:43,660
Help for 5 subs?

1860
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:47,800
I pay you the 5 subs?

1861
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:48,460
What is this?

1862
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:54,780
When did we turn into Chatini?

1863
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,360
I don't know.

1864
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:57,340
Someone said it.

1865
02:04:57,420 --> 02:04:58,500
Someone said...

1866
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:01,120
Someone said... Oh, jetpack.

1867
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:05,440
I'm fulfilling the thing that Chatini want.

1868
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:13,860
If Raura does not... does not, you know...

1869
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:19,580
If she does not deliver, it is my duty.

1870
02:05:29,990 --> 02:05:32,050
We will have a jetpack one way or the other.

1871
02:05:33,530 --> 02:05:34,770
That's the spirit.

1872
02:05:39,770 --> 02:05:41,470
It's not here, right bird?

1873
02:05:41,470 --> 02:05:41,550
Bird.

1874
02:05:45,110 --> 02:05:46,330
Wait, which way do I go?

1875
02:05:48,130 --> 02:05:51,430
Oh, I think this is just where a guy was.

1876
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:51,810
Nevermind.

1877
02:05:52,490 --> 02:05:52,490
OK.

1878
02:05:56,330 --> 02:05:58,210
What's so special about a jetpack anyway?

1879
02:06:01,430 --> 02:06:02,970
What's so special about a jetpack?

1880
02:06:03,050 --> 02:06:04,110
Like, why do you want one so bad?

1881
02:06:04,450 --> 02:06:06,230
Why do the Chatini want one so bad?

1882
02:06:10,390 --> 02:06:11,510
It's just cool.

1883
02:06:12,170 --> 02:06:14,610
There's like no... I mean, yeah.

1884
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:18,370
But there's no like, oh, I want it for this purpose.

1885
02:06:18,590 --> 02:06:19,930
It's just because it's cool.

1886
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:24,170
If you have to ask, you wouldn't get it.

1887
02:06:25,670 --> 02:06:26,530
God, mom.

1888
02:06:26,570 --> 02:06:27,750
You're so uncool.

1889
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:28,930
God.

1890
02:06:29,530 --> 02:06:30,790
If you have to ask...

1891
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:42,320
Oops.

1892
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:45,220
A ghost wouldn't understand.

1893
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:46,300
You can already fly.

1894
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:47,600
That's what I'm saying.

1895
02:06:47,820 --> 02:06:49,320
You know, like I...

1896
02:06:52,630 --> 02:06:55,290
I'm trying to understand you all.

1897
02:06:57,130 --> 02:06:59,630
I'm trying to understand you all.

1898
02:07:03,130 --> 02:07:03,650
Yippee!

1899
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:05,870
If you had a jetpack, you wouldn't have fallen.

1900
02:07:08,470 --> 02:07:09,590
Too soon.

1901
02:07:10,190 --> 02:07:11,410
Too soon, weirdosity.

1902
02:07:12,930 --> 02:07:14,150
Too soon!

1903
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:17,410
And with that...

1904
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:22,500
Gorilla is 100%!

1905
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:25,180
I think?

1906
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:26,920
Actually, maybe tech... Wait.

1907
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:28,740
Yes, technique, right?

1908
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:29,660
100%!

1909
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:30,940
I think?

1910
02:07:31,780 --> 02:07:32,840
Right, I think?

1911
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:40,200
Yeah!

1912
02:07:45,030 --> 02:07:47,350
This one doesn't have puzzle pieces, but has people.

1913
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:51,270
This one has one puzzle piece and people.

1914
02:07:54,330 --> 02:07:55,810
One puzzle piece and people.

1915
02:07:57,150 --> 02:07:58,610
One puzzle piece and people.

1916
02:08:02,030 --> 02:08:03,770
I guess we'll go in order.

1917
02:08:05,910 --> 02:08:07,230
Oh, no puzzle piece.

1918
02:08:07,870 --> 02:08:08,390
Snake.

1919
02:08:13,090 --> 02:08:13,670
Wait.

1920
02:08:20,790 --> 02:08:21,370
People.

1921
02:08:27,730 --> 02:08:28,310
Oh,

1922
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:34,620
level.

1923
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:36,520
This one?

1924
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:38,380
No.

1925
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:43,280
Which is the one with the puzzle piece?

1926
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:43,820
Otsumito!

1927
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:44,740
Gotta sleep for tomorrow.

1928
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:45,760
Good night, Senshi!

1929
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:47,420
Thanks for watching!

1930
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:48,280
Thanks for the super chat!

1931
02:08:59,550 --> 02:09:00,750
Where is it?

1932
02:09:01,710 --> 02:09:02,710
I'm so confused.

1933
02:09:04,950 --> 02:09:06,470
Ghosts pass through objects.

1934
02:09:07,110 --> 02:09:09,890
Earth and solar system are constantly moving through space.

1935
02:09:10,650 --> 02:09:12,290
Ghosts pass through that.

1936
02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:17,470
That means there are billions of ghosts just out there in space.

1937
02:09:17,470 --> 02:09:18,650
Space is haunted.

1938
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:24,500
What am I missing?

1939
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:31,740
Got it.

1940
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:35,860
That was so easy!

1941
02:09:36,780 --> 02:09:37,400
OK, bye!

1942
02:09:46,110 --> 02:09:47,490
No way!

1943
02:09:48,630 --> 02:09:50,610
Maybe I wonder if these are the same then.

1944
02:09:54,990 --> 02:09:55,510
Unless...unless...unless...unless...unless...

1945
02:09:56,570 --> 02:09:57,090
Local.

1946
02:09:58,210 --> 02:09:58,950
It's not.

1947
02:10:01,110 --> 02:10:02,330
Two more to go!

1948
02:10:05,910 --> 02:10:07,550
I like this level though.

1949
02:10:07,610 --> 02:10:08,890
This one was really fun.

1950
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:13,550
Guys, are we going to cooperate now?

1951
02:10:13,630 --> 02:10:15,150
If anybody knows where the puzzle piece is.

1952
02:10:16,890 --> 02:10:18,570
It's the very last one.

1953
02:10:19,710 --> 02:10:23,250
Are we going to cooperate or do I need to ask the bird?

1954
02:10:34,720 --> 02:10:35,720
Snow area.

1955
02:10:35,900 --> 02:10:36,880
In the snow area.

1956
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:37,260
OK.

1957
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:53,790
Oh god, I forgot how catchy this song is.

1958
02:10:59,030 --> 02:10:59,530
Yay!

1959
02:11:02,430 --> 02:11:02,930
Yay!

1960
02:11:03,570 --> 02:11:04,790
I forgot how...

1961
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:11,440
Snow area.

1962
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:17,940
OK, I'm trusting you guys.

1963
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,460
There is a snow area in this game or in this...

1964
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:24,360
Oops.

1965
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:37,760
Squeeze!

1966
02:11:46,540 --> 02:11:47,060
Combine!

1967
02:11:59,230 --> 02:12:05,730
I didn't know the Discord icon was in this game.

1968
02:12:06,490 --> 02:12:09,550
Oh yeah, I guess it just kind of looks like that, right?

1969
02:12:22,530 --> 02:12:23,510
Puzzle piece.

1970
02:12:23,870 --> 02:12:25,290
Money, money, money, money!

1971
02:12:25,290 --> 02:12:28,730
Get it

1972
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:40,260
this way.

1973
02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:41,540
Go this way.

1974
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:42,440
Oh no!

1975
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:45,460
Nice.

1976
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:48,200
Nice.

1977
02:12:48,620 --> 02:12:49,060
Money!

1978
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:55,620
Close!

1979
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:06,340
Am I close?

1980
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:14,500
Not just yet.

1981
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:18,920
I'm going to wait.

1982
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:24,860
Wait, I want the money.

1983
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:27,880
OK, never mind.

1984
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:28,660
I'll just grab this.

1985
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:30,520
I won't be greedy.

1986
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:31,340
I won't be greedy.

1987
02:13:42,370 --> 02:13:44,930
Oh man, I must...

1988
02:13:44,930 --> 02:13:45,250
Nice.

1989
02:13:48,430 --> 02:13:48,910
Ice!

1990
02:13:49,030 --> 02:13:49,310
Ice!

1991
02:13:49,430 --> 02:13:49,750
Ice!

1992
02:13:49,810 --> 02:13:50,110
Ice!

1993
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:50,550
Ice!

1994
02:13:51,050 --> 02:13:52,090
We found it.

1995
02:13:57,020 --> 02:13:58,760
Hit the trees.

1996
02:14:07,700 --> 02:14:08,620
Hit

1997
02:14:14,020 --> 02:14:15,600
all the trees.

1998
02:14:18,740 --> 02:14:20,140
I did it.

1999
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:24,180
Do I have to get the flowers?

2000
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:28,620
Uncover the flowers.

2001
02:14:28,900 --> 02:14:29,060
OK.

2002
02:14:58,350 --> 02:14:59,050
Nice.

2003
02:15:00,530 --> 02:15:02,070
How many more are there?

2004
02:15:03,410 --> 02:15:04,470
This one maybe?

2005
02:15:05,390 --> 02:15:06,430
It's kind of small though.

2006
02:15:13,060 --> 02:15:17,060
Let me get the coins and we leave.

2007
02:15:17,480 --> 02:15:20,620
Thank you very much, much, much, much, much.

2008
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:25,060
Thank you guys!

2009
02:15:25,940 --> 02:15:26,900
No help.

2010
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:30,740
You guys can't resist.

2011
02:15:34,100 --> 02:15:35,780
Venture rampage.

2012
02:15:36,380 --> 02:15:39,120
Alrighty, I think that's all the...

2013
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:42,080
That's all the puzzle pieces here?

2014
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:46,560
Yes, now we just need one more here.

2015
02:15:48,900 --> 02:15:50,120
Is it here?

2016
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:52,540
Yup.

2017
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:53,900
Luna sola.

2018
02:15:59,230 --> 02:16:01,050
You're going to need all the bots too?

2019
02:16:04,190 --> 02:16:06,110
Maybe at least 300 maybe.

2020
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:09,350
Maybe just 300, right?

2021
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:19,200
Need 300 after the puzzle piece.

2022
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:19,460
OK.

2023
02:16:20,060 --> 02:16:22,120
I think we're pretty close to that.

2024
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:23,640
We might be able to.

2025
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:25,560
Oh my god.

2026
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:30,500
We might be able to.

2027
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:32,000
Yeah, we're 11 away.

2028
02:16:35,380 --> 02:16:36,780
I think we can do it.

2029
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:41,640
We have quite a few things that...

2030
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,820
That... Like how we just destroyed their homes.

2031
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:53,340
Quite a few that still have... Not just the challenge levels either, you know?

2032
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:55,440
I think we can do it guys.

2033
02:16:58,980 --> 02:17:03,000
This was by the last secret area where the last bot was.

2034
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:04,500
OK, I'll try to remember.

2035
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:05,560
I don't remember.

2036
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:08,040
But we'll get it.

2037
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:08,920
I believe in us.

2038
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:10,440
I believe in us!

2039
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:18,700
For now, I'm just trying to get some money.

2040
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:22,840
Grab some extra money, you know?

2041
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:27,860
Wait, where's this... Oh yeah, that guy.

2042
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:38,760
There's a guy right there.

2043
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:39,920
That's so funny.

2044
02:17:43,380 --> 02:17:44,280
And... Day.

2045
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:49,120
Hi mean dog.

2046
02:17:49,460 --> 02:17:49,740
Hello.

2047
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:52,580
That was close.

2048
02:17:59,180 --> 02:17:59,780
Good dodge.

2049
02:17:59,860 --> 02:18:00,340
Thank you.

2050
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:03,120
I do a bit of gamering myself, you know, sometimes.

2051
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:09,760
I do a bit of gamer play sometimes, you know?

2052
02:18:14,530 --> 02:18:15,590
Oh my goodness.

2053
02:18:17,150 --> 02:18:17,690
Guys,

2054
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:42,220
let me know when I'm close.

2055
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:43,720
Gamer Minto.

2056
02:18:44,300 --> 02:18:45,040
Too strong.

2057
02:18:47,140 --> 02:18:49,340
I smell worse too when I'm gaming.

2058
02:18:50,340 --> 02:18:51,720
I

2059
02:18:58,940 --> 02:19:00,260
don't think there's anything there.

2060
02:19:02,780 --> 02:19:04,220
Look at this guy.

2061
02:19:05,580 --> 02:19:06,320
Stupid.

2062
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:16,060
Scared me.

2063
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:21,900
Nice.

2064
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:30,000
Piggy bank?

2065
02:19:30,860 --> 02:19:32,960
Oh, maybe I should have used it on the pumpkin.

2066
02:19:40,210 --> 02:19:41,350
Give us check back.

2067
02:19:42,870 --> 02:19:44,290
If you ask nicely.

2068
02:19:46,370 --> 02:19:46,770
Maybe.

2069
02:19:50,990 --> 02:19:51,930
Am I close?

2070
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:59,720
I like how when I go past, he's like...

2071
02:20:04,890 --> 02:20:07,610
This music feels so like Disney.

2072
02:20:09,390 --> 02:20:10,910
So... Toy Story.

2073
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:19,060
Oh my god, someone else in chat just said Toy Story.

2074
02:20:20,440 --> 02:20:21,140
You are Minto.

2075
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:31,460
I don't remember where the end is.

2076
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:34,640
Is it on the moon?

2077
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:37,180
I'm trying to remember so I don't miss it, you know?

2078
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:42,440
But I...

2079
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:46,860
Feel like I... I don't know...

2080
02:20:50,730 --> 02:20:52,030
What's the piece?

2081
02:20:56,270 --> 02:20:57,510
He's gaming?

2082
02:20:58,430 --> 02:20:59,670
He's gaming.

2083
02:21:00,690 --> 02:21:02,570
I don't see a piece.

2084
02:21:04,430 --> 02:21:05,810
It's still ahead?

2085
02:21:05,970 --> 02:21:06,290
OK.

2086
02:21:07,150 --> 02:21:08,070
I'm a little...

2087
02:21:09,710 --> 02:21:10,590
Paranoid.

2088
02:21:20,580 --> 02:21:21,020
Ouch.

2089
02:21:26,970 --> 02:21:28,250
And goodbye water.

2090
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:49,120
Oh, I forgot I can just punch these guys while they are going by.

2091
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:50,540
It's OK though.

2092
02:21:51,580 --> 02:21:52,340
Oh, that's right.

2093
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:52,840
Punch!

2094
02:21:52,900 --> 02:21:53,020
Punch!

2095
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:53,220
Punch!

2096
02:21:54,700 --> 02:21:55,900
We'll get them next time.

2097
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:57,220
Close by?

2098
02:21:57,760 --> 02:21:57,900
Punch!

2099
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:58,080
Punch!

2100
02:21:58,200 --> 02:21:58,360
Punch!

2101
02:21:58,440 --> 02:21:58,560
Punch!

2102
02:21:58,680 --> 02:21:58,720
Punch!

2103
02:21:58,860 --> 02:21:58,860
Punch!

2104
02:22:00,340 --> 02:22:00,680
Punch!

2105
02:22:00,940 --> 02:22:00,940
Punch!

2106
02:22:02,660 --> 02:22:03,040
Punch!

2107
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:03,700
Punch!

2108
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:03,800
Punch!

2109
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:04,140
Punch!

2110
02:22:04,140 --> 02:22:04,200
Punch!

2111
02:22:06,020 --> 02:22:07,060
There we go.

2112
02:22:08,060 --> 02:22:10,040
Close by.

2113
02:22:16,630 --> 02:22:18,370
Close by.

2114
02:22:32,530 --> 02:22:34,630
So I got this one.

2115
02:22:35,650 --> 02:22:36,890
Before.

2116
02:22:37,950 --> 02:22:39,130
It's definitely not that one.

2117
02:22:41,550 --> 02:22:42,930
Close by.

2118
02:22:45,510 --> 02:22:46,750
Yeah.

2119
02:22:56,310 --> 02:22:56,970
OK.

2120
02:22:57,850 --> 02:22:58,950
Close by.

2121
02:23:11,570 --> 02:23:13,130
Close by.

2122
02:23:16,620 --> 02:23:18,140
Close by.

2123
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:22,080
I'm guessing somewhere here, but...

2124
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:24,180
Is it that?

2125
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:30,240
Is it this?

2126
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:35,920
I

2127
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:44,820
think I just passed it before.

2128
02:23:45,540 --> 02:23:46,360
That's so funny.

2129
02:23:47,220 --> 02:23:47,800
100%!

2130
02:23:48,620 --> 02:23:51,680
Yeah, see there are these little ones that are not...

2131
02:23:52,220 --> 02:23:54,660
That are not... What's it called?

2132
02:23:58,040 --> 02:24:01,420
Like the super difficult challenge ones that we can do.

2133
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:03,920
I think to get enough...

2134
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:05,800
To get enough...

2135
02:24:06,620 --> 02:24:07,480
To 300.

2136
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:09,480
Maybe.

2137
02:24:12,100 --> 02:24:13,560
Is that all of them then?

2138
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:16,200
Is that all of them?

2139
02:24:22,700 --> 02:24:23,580
Let's see!

2140
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:30,060
1, 2, 3...

2141
02:24:32,060 --> 02:24:33,640
We did it!

2142
02:24:38,780 --> 02:24:40,620
That was the very last puzzle piece.

2143
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:41,180
Well done!

2144
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:43,780
Looks like a special friend awaits you at the top.

2145
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:45,980
Oh my god, I better be good.

2146
02:25:01,630 --> 02:25:02,350
300.

2147
02:25:03,850 --> 02:25:04,570
300!

2148
02:25:08,570 --> 02:25:09,290
OK.

2149
02:25:10,890 --> 02:25:12,930
We just need 11 more, you guys!

2150
02:25:13,010 --> 02:25:13,430
11.

2151
02:25:15,190 --> 02:25:15,870
11.

2152
02:25:18,430 --> 02:25:19,570
It's awful.

2153
02:25:19,730 --> 02:25:20,590
I better get ready to...

2154
02:25:20,590 --> 02:25:23,590
It better be... It better be the best...

2155
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:26,850
The best guy that could be waiting there.

2156
02:25:36,430 --> 02:25:37,110
OK.

2157
02:25:39,510 --> 02:25:41,670
This one has...

2158
02:25:41,670 --> 02:25:44,150
I think those are the O's.

2159
02:25:45,090 --> 02:25:46,090
This one has quite a few.

2160
02:25:46,290 --> 02:25:47,150
Let's see what we got in here.

2161
02:25:47,750 --> 02:25:49,510
We have that one retro...

2162
02:25:50,350 --> 02:25:50,830
Whatever.

2163
02:25:51,090 --> 02:25:51,430
Nantoka.

2164
02:25:52,270 --> 02:25:55,510
Retro Rampage and Crumble Ramble.

2165
02:25:55,510 --> 02:25:57,670
Let's just do this one real quick.

2166
02:26:01,490 --> 02:26:03,070
We got this.

2167
02:26:03,170 --> 02:26:04,010
Who are you hoping for?

2168
02:26:06,490 --> 02:26:07,850
Snake or...

2169
02:26:08,790 --> 02:26:10,110
Probably snake.

2170
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:14,650
Oh, I don't remember how...

2171
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:18,330
How do I defeat these guys?

2172
02:26:19,630 --> 02:26:20,670
Imagine it's Chewy.

2173
02:26:21,630 --> 02:26:22,250
Be great.

2174
02:26:22,250 --> 02:26:22,330
Hit.

2175
02:26:29,220 --> 02:26:30,640
Oh my gosh.

2176
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:30,980
OK.

2177
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:32,160
No worries.

2178
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:35,000
Oh, I have to crumble the floor.

2179
02:26:35,180 --> 02:26:35,660
That's right.

2180
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:35,940
OK.

2181
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:36,500
Thank you, guys.

2182
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:52,020
Maybe I don't...

2183
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:53,000
Stand so close though.

2184
02:27:16,900 --> 02:27:17,800
Oh my god.

2185
02:27:21,420 --> 02:27:23,160
That was so close.

2186
02:27:24,340 --> 02:27:25,300
That was so close.

2187
02:27:53,660 --> 02:27:55,120
I mistimed it.

2188
02:27:55,500 --> 02:27:58,000
I mistimed it by such a tiny amount.

2189
02:28:02,240 --> 02:28:03,420
That's so funny.

2190
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:05,220
Oh shit.

2191
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:06,280
I mistimed it again.

2192
02:28:06,420 --> 02:28:07,080
I mistimed it.

2193
02:28:07,140 --> 02:28:07,740
It's my bad.

2194
02:28:08,660 --> 02:28:09,760
I was so close.

2195
02:28:10,860 --> 02:28:13,340
Literally just a tiny bit.

2196
02:28:20,170 --> 02:28:21,490
No, I messed up.

2197
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:33,080
It's OK.

2198
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:04,520
Oh no.

2199
02:29:09,070 --> 02:29:10,390
I know it's a little bit in the back.

2200
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:18,860
Oh, come on.

2201
02:29:19,770 --> 02:29:22,060
This is the trickiest crumble level.

2202
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:23,580
If I remember correctly.

2203
02:29:24,420 --> 02:29:24,900
I see.

2204
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:26,720
It's tight.

2205
02:29:29,720 --> 02:29:31,280
It's pretty tight.

2206
02:29:32,180 --> 02:29:33,040
Oh, I think that works.

2207
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:36,720
Oh, come on.

2208
02:29:39,620 --> 02:29:42,980
The jump is so fast there.

2209
02:29:57,510 --> 02:29:58,070
I

2210
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:14,660
think they jump...

2211
02:30:35,110 --> 02:30:37,730
Using your spin attack midair would slow down the fall.

2212
02:30:42,130 --> 02:30:43,070
Maybe, yeah.

2213
02:30:43,310 --> 02:30:44,250
I'm trying to remember it.

2214
02:31:03,570 --> 02:31:06,230
Try going counterclockwise, but...

2215
02:31:07,490 --> 02:31:08,490
I don't know.

2216
02:31:08,890 --> 02:31:10,250
I feel more comfortable doing this.

2217
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,920
You guys, I'm regressing.

2218
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:20,000
I'm regressing.

2219
02:31:20,180 --> 02:31:22,100
This is so bad.

2220
02:31:23,830 --> 02:31:25,840
I pushed on the controller.

2221
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:27,880
Sometimes he grips.

2222
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:30,640
Sometimes he doesn't.

2223
02:31:43,860 --> 02:31:48,590
I feel like I'm jumping in time, but obviously I'm not.

2224
02:31:49,010 --> 02:31:51,910
But visually, it looks like I'm jumping in time.

2225
02:31:56,280 --> 02:31:57,120
Uh-oh.

2226
02:31:57,580 --> 02:31:59,040
I left a piece.

2227
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:04,480
You know what?

2228
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:04,900
It's fine.

2229
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:06,540
It's fine.

2230
02:32:08,500 --> 02:32:09,980
It's just really wide.

2231
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:31,820
I'll just have to come back for it.

2232
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:37,980
If you get closer, you won't have to go as far.

2233
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:41,500
But the timing of the... What's it called?

2234
02:32:41,580 --> 02:32:42,640
Is the issue for me.

2235
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:48,700
That was pretty good, though.

2236
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:52,760
Let's see.

2237
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:54,040
I don't think I can crumble.

2238
02:32:54,580 --> 02:32:59,260
Or rather, I don't crumble before they start going, because then I don't have enough for my jetpack.

2239
02:33:00,780 --> 02:33:01,260
Nice.

2240
02:33:06,320 --> 02:33:06,980
I see.

2241
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:08,260
I don't know.

2242
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:11,180
I'll try.

2243
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:12,600
I'll try still closer, though.

2244
02:33:29,930 --> 02:33:32,530
I think if I had not gone out, I would have made it.

2245
02:33:34,350 --> 02:33:35,170
Why not attack?

2246
02:33:35,350 --> 02:33:36,790
Because you can attack these guys.

2247
02:33:36,910 --> 02:33:37,750
They don't take damage.

2248
02:33:43,710 --> 02:33:45,490
They do not take damage.

2249
02:33:56,780 --> 02:33:59,580
I was trying to connect it!

2250
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:04,020
So close.

2251
02:34:04,100 --> 02:34:06,440
I don't think it would have worked to die anyway, though.

2252
02:34:08,020 --> 02:34:09,580
Because it's not all...

2253
02:34:36,790 --> 02:34:39,150
You are ready for Bloodborne after this.

2254
02:34:43,070 --> 02:34:43,610
Good.

2255
02:34:49,790 --> 02:34:51,250
I need some water soon.

2256
02:34:51,730 --> 02:34:52,990
I'm very dehydrated.

2257
02:34:52,990 --> 02:34:56,450
I need to refresh my ectoplasm!

2258
02:35:20,070 --> 02:35:21,010
Okay, hold on.

2259
02:35:21,090 --> 02:35:21,850
I'm gonna go get water.

2260
02:36:16,060 --> 02:36:17,240
I have hot water.

2261
02:36:20,560 --> 02:36:23,840
I didn't know Astrobot had a souls-like experience.

2262
02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:24,320
Oh my god!

2263
02:36:24,660 --> 02:36:26,380
The challenge levels are actually...

2264
02:36:27,260 --> 02:36:31,040
are actually so, so much.

2265
02:36:31,500 --> 02:36:32,800
So, so tricky.

2266
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:33,760
Author!

2267
02:36:34,180 --> 02:36:34,980
Welcome to membership!

2268
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:35,780
Thank you!

2269
02:36:35,920 --> 02:36:37,480
They are so, like...

2270
02:36:37,480 --> 02:36:39,480
They are so...

2271
02:36:40,340 --> 02:36:41,740
Look, he's dead.

2272
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:43,100
He's dead!

2273
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:44,520
Challenging?

2274
02:36:44,860 --> 02:36:47,020
Yeah, I mean the challenge levels.

2275
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:49,860
But I was trying to say...

2276
02:36:49,860 --> 02:36:50,720
I don't remember.

2277
02:36:53,480 --> 02:36:57,050
I don't remember what I was saying.

2278
02:36:58,770 --> 02:37:00,830
Okay, my reward will be the water.

2279
02:37:01,630 --> 02:37:03,350
I have to let it cool down a little bit.

2280
02:37:03,350 --> 02:37:04,390
Okay.

2281
02:37:14,280 --> 02:37:15,120
Oh,

2282
02:37:23,150 --> 02:37:23,730
nice, nice.

2283
02:37:24,630 --> 02:37:25,590
Except not nice.

2284
02:37:26,270 --> 02:37:27,010
I just noticed.

2285
02:37:27,890 --> 02:37:29,130
I just noticed.

2286
02:37:34,960 --> 02:37:35,800
What!?

2287
02:37:35,800 --> 02:37:37,340
No, I jumped!

2288
02:37:37,420 --> 02:37:39,040
That's so messed up!

2289
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:41,560
I jumped!

2290
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:43,000
I did!

2291
02:37:43,100 --> 02:37:43,640
I did!

2292
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:45,580
I was just going back for the other ones.

2293
02:37:48,620 --> 02:37:50,220
I know I missed a spot.

2294
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:52,120
That's what I was going back for.

2295
02:37:53,260 --> 02:37:54,700
You don't need to tell me.

2296
02:37:56,560 --> 02:37:58,180
You missed a spot, Minto.

2297
02:37:58,860 --> 02:38:00,860
Literally a booger on my nose.

2298
02:38:10,010 --> 02:38:10,990
Oh, oh shit!

2299
02:38:11,070 --> 02:38:11,930
Oh shit, my hot water.

2300
02:38:12,050 --> 02:38:12,370
Oh my god.

2301
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:08,380
Everything's fine.

2302
02:39:08,420 --> 02:39:09,300
I'm just cleaning it up.

2303
02:39:09,300 --> 02:39:11,260
Come to

2304
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:17,980
the desk after you have a full glass of water.

2305
02:39:35,650 --> 02:39:36,010
It's okay.

2306
02:39:36,170 --> 02:39:40,510
I needed to wash my...

2307
02:39:42,450 --> 02:39:44,890
I needed to wash my desk mat anyway.

2308
02:39:48,710 --> 02:39:51,010
Okay, Astro died again.

2309
02:39:51,510 --> 02:39:52,550
He died of cringe.

2310
02:39:54,990 --> 02:39:57,410
He was like, oh brother.

2311
02:39:58,230 --> 02:40:00,110
I can't believe she did that.

2312
02:40:08,140 --> 02:40:10,040
No, this is not the pre-wash.

2313
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:14,140
I'm going to wash it because it wasn't just water, it was also tea.

2314
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:19,660
Oh brother, this guy stinks.

2315
02:40:20,360 --> 02:40:22,120
It wasn't just water, it was tea.

2316
02:40:22,820 --> 02:40:24,060
So I want to wash it.

2317
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:26,680
And then I got some other...

2318
02:40:27,420 --> 02:40:28,440
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

2319
02:40:32,920 --> 02:40:33,720
Spilled the tea.

2320
02:40:34,080 --> 02:40:35,300
I'm dead, girlfriend.

2321
02:40:35,860 --> 02:40:37,000
I spilled the tea.

2322
02:40:38,760 --> 02:40:41,920
I spilled the tea.

2323
02:40:42,680 --> 02:40:43,620
I think I missed a spot.

2324
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:44,260
Yeah, I did.

2325
02:40:47,380 --> 02:40:48,260
Oh no!

2326
02:41:04,690 --> 02:41:06,610
Maybe try it further to the outside, Minto.

2327
02:41:07,470 --> 02:41:09,770
I don't think that's the issue though.

2328
02:41:13,840 --> 02:41:15,720
Oh my god, I jumped!

2329
02:41:15,780 --> 02:41:16,180
I jumped!

2330
02:41:23,020 --> 02:41:25,220
Are you pressing left or is that automatic?

2331
02:41:28,180 --> 02:41:30,140
You mean running?

2332
02:41:31,620 --> 02:41:32,400
That's me.

2333
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:37,780
I'll try a bigger circle.

2334
02:41:38,740 --> 02:41:43,120
I don't know the timing of the rings now.

2335
02:41:45,800 --> 02:41:46,680
I don't want to go clockwise.

2336
02:41:47,140 --> 02:41:48,480
I like going counterclockwise.

2337
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:54,240
Okay, okay.

2338
02:41:54,780 --> 02:41:55,080
Alright.

2339
02:41:58,840 --> 02:42:00,040
Oh no.

2340
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:01,620
Oh no.

2341
02:42:07,800 --> 02:42:09,000
A triangle.

2342
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:11,500
Oh my god, pirate, you're cooking?

2343
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:13,000
Let's try it.

2344
02:42:19,360 --> 02:42:21,860
Okay, I don't know how to make a triangle, apparently.

2345
02:42:24,120 --> 02:42:27,440
I don't know how to make one.

2346
02:42:28,320 --> 02:42:28,560
Oh

2347
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,360
god, my fingers aren't adjusted to this.

2348
02:42:35,580 --> 02:42:37,380
I know I have to go counterclockwise.

2349
02:42:37,580 --> 02:42:39,180
It doesn't matter which way you go, you guys.

2350
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:40,040
It really doesn't.

2351
02:42:40,360 --> 02:42:44,300
Just my fingers are more inclined to go to the right, you know?

2352
02:42:44,840 --> 02:42:45,680
Because I'm right-handed.

2353
02:42:52,450 --> 02:42:53,290
Oh, shoot.

2354
02:42:53,950 --> 02:42:55,830
I meant to just jump and not double jump.

2355
02:42:55,830 --> 02:42:58,030
Okay, I need to... I don't know.

2356
02:42:59,030 --> 02:43:00,790
I was so close that one time.

2357
02:43:01,070 --> 02:43:01,730
I'm so angry.

2358
02:43:02,850 --> 02:43:03,850
I'm so mad.

2359
02:43:03,850 --> 02:43:04,830
Hi.

2360
02:43:05,650 --> 02:43:06,390
Hi.

2361
02:43:06,650 --> 02:43:06,970
Hi.

2362
02:43:09,670 --> 02:43:10,410
Hi.

2363
02:43:10,890 --> 02:43:11,610
Hi.

2364
02:43:11,870 --> 02:43:12,230
Hi.

2365
02:43:15,230 --> 02:43:15,970
Hi.

2366
02:43:16,570 --> 02:43:16,830
Hi.

2367
02:43:18,630 --> 02:43:19,000
Hi.

2368
02:43:20,650 --> 02:43:21,390
Hi.

2369
02:43:21,690 --> 02:43:21,890
Hi.

2370
02:43:21,890 --> 02:43:22,490
Are

2371
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:30,660
you right eye dominant as well?

2372
02:43:30,740 --> 02:43:32,800
Well, that is my weaker eye, actually.

2373
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:37,480
Like, my prescription is strong.

2374
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:41,020
Yeah, my prescription is stronger than my right eye.

2375
02:43:42,540 --> 02:43:43,220
UEFA!

2376
02:43:43,880 --> 02:43:44,960
Welcome to the membership.

2377
02:43:45,200 --> 02:43:45,540
Thank you.

2378
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:51,920
Okay.

2379
02:43:52,360 --> 02:43:53,040
Okay.

2380
02:43:53,140 --> 02:43:53,320
Okay.

2381
02:44:02,540 --> 02:44:03,220
Okay,

2382
02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:10,300
whatever works.

2383
02:44:10,300 --> 02:44:10,460
Whatever works.

2384
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:14,860
No!

2385
02:44:16,490 --> 02:44:18,950
It's always that part!

2386
02:44:19,230 --> 02:44:20,710
It's always that part!

2387
02:44:20,990 --> 02:44:26,930
I think I need to change my camera angle because it's really throwing me off.

2388
02:44:27,910 --> 02:44:29,870
It's throwing me off.

2389
02:44:31,210 --> 02:44:34,570
Oh, it's my depth perception, you guys.

2390
02:44:35,350 --> 02:44:36,650
It's my depth perception.

2391
02:44:36,810 --> 02:44:39,110
It's literally... I keep dying in there.

2392
02:44:41,670 --> 02:44:42,830
I keep dying in that.

2393
02:44:43,290 --> 02:44:44,370
Fuck me, man.

2394
02:44:44,470 --> 02:44:45,690
I'm so fucking dumb.

2395
02:45:08,450 --> 02:45:09,330
It works.

2396
02:45:09,390 --> 02:45:09,990
It works, I think.

2397
02:45:10,130 --> 02:45:10,450
Oh no.

2398
02:45:12,390 --> 02:45:12,850
Oh no.

2399
02:45:13,350 --> 02:45:18,210
I was busy looking at the parts.

2400
02:45:21,730 --> 02:45:23,190
We're almost there, I feel.

2401
02:45:23,390 --> 02:45:23,610
Maybe.

2402
02:45:23,610 --> 02:45:23,710
Maybe.

2403
02:45:33,260 --> 02:45:34,540
Did I miss a part?

2404
02:45:34,680 --> 02:45:35,500
I did.

2405
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:28,500
Gonna be here for a minute.

2406
02:46:29,220 --> 02:46:30,140
For a mint minute.

2407
02:46:31,120 --> 02:46:33,120
We've already been here for a mint minute.

2408
02:47:00,350 --> 02:47:02,330
It really is that perspective.

2409
02:47:03,050 --> 02:47:05,090
It's that perspective right there.

2410
02:47:05,650 --> 02:47:07,530
That's why I'm gonna try and take care of it first.

2411
02:47:26,770 --> 02:47:27,410
Wait.

2412
02:47:27,950 --> 02:47:28,330
Hold on.

2413
02:47:28,470 --> 02:47:29,430
I wasn't focused.

2414
02:47:49,780 --> 02:47:51,580
How perfect does it have to be?

2415
02:47:53,060 --> 02:47:53,640
Oh god!

2416
02:47:54,380 --> 02:47:55,440
How perfect does...

2417
02:48:07,270 --> 02:48:09,430
This is all for only one bot, right?

2418
02:48:09,650 --> 02:48:10,290
Yup.

2419
02:48:11,670 --> 02:48:16,170
Hopefully the other retro levels won't be so tricky though, I hope.

2420
02:48:16,650 --> 02:48:17,450
I'm hoping.

2421
02:48:19,150 --> 02:48:20,430
Please!

2422
02:48:31,180 --> 02:48:32,460
Please die!

2423
02:48:33,360 --> 02:48:34,600
Please die!

2424
02:48:36,040 --> 02:48:38,020
Please die!

2425
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:41,580
Please die!

2426
02:48:47,960 --> 02:48:49,480
Wait, it counts, right?

2427
02:48:55,720 --> 02:48:57,380
This game.

2428
02:48:57,840 --> 02:48:59,460
Game hates me.

2429
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:03,060
It hates me!

2430
02:49:04,060 --> 02:49:06,700
It has to be absolutely perfect!

2431
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:23,680
I had no where... Ah, fuck me.

2432
02:49:26,940 --> 02:49:29,160
Oh my god!

2433
02:49:31,400 --> 02:49:33,640
I tasted victory!

2434
02:49:34,440 --> 02:49:39,660
And they ripped it from my cold, already dead hands!

2435
02:49:59,440 --> 02:49:59,920
No!

2436
02:50:07,700 --> 02:50:09,480
Oh my god.

2437
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:15,700
You could probably have gotten 11 bots already if you just found them in regular levels.

2438
02:50:15,940 --> 02:50:17,260
Well, Michael, that's the funny thing.

2439
02:50:17,420 --> 02:50:19,920
I'm pretty sure I found them in all the other regular levels.

2440
02:50:20,420 --> 02:50:22,600
So, this is all I've got!

2441
02:50:24,400 --> 02:50:26,240
This is all I've got!

2442
02:50:27,920 --> 02:50:28,700
Oh shit.

2443
02:50:50,480 --> 02:50:54,160
It's one... It's one little round, they said!

2444
02:50:54,720 --> 02:50:56,540
Just fight the bells, they said!

2445
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:08,800
Just fight the bells, they said!

2446
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:09,740
Oh shit.

2447
02:51:09,960 --> 02:51:11,180
I mistimed it.

2448
02:51:12,340 --> 02:51:14,240
I'll be trying to move diagonally.

2449
02:51:24,080 --> 02:51:24,560
Gosh.

2450
02:51:25,980 --> 02:51:28,640
Why does it have to be so perfect, man?

2451
02:51:28,760 --> 02:51:29,380
Oh my god.

2452
02:51:29,440 --> 02:51:30,300
No, I just killed it.

2453
02:51:30,340 --> 02:51:31,220
I just killed it for me.

2454
02:51:32,900 --> 02:51:35,260
I just... I won't have anywhere to jump!

2455
02:51:41,720 --> 02:51:43,280
I'm not gonna have anywhere to jump!

2456
02:51:57,970 --> 02:51:59,350
Happy birthday, Malfius!

2457
02:51:59,850 --> 02:52:01,430
I can't sing you happy birthday.

2458
02:52:01,930 --> 02:52:02,750
I'm sorry.

2459
02:52:02,910 --> 02:52:03,890
Happy birthday to you!

2460
02:52:04,190 --> 02:52:05,130
Happy birthday to you!

2461
02:52:05,370 --> 02:52:06,810
Happy birthday to you, Malfius!

2462
02:52:06,810 --> 02:52:10,570
Happy birthday to you!

2463
02:52:38,650 --> 02:52:40,770
Oh no!

2464
02:52:45,810 --> 02:52:46,630
Oh my god!

2465
02:52:46,930 --> 02:52:48,230
That's just enough!

2466
02:52:58,520 --> 02:53:02,660
Get me out of here.

2467
02:53:02,660 --> 02:53:02,760
Get me out of here.

2468
02:53:13,690 --> 02:53:15,590
For one single guy?

2469
02:53:21,150 --> 02:53:23,630
The birthday rush was the key I was filled with.

2470
02:53:23,930 --> 02:53:26,670
I was like, I have to do this for your birthday!

2471
02:53:30,070 --> 02:53:31,050
We're still gaming!

2472
02:53:31,450 --> 02:53:32,530
Oh, where did the doll go now?

2473
02:53:36,050 --> 02:53:36,530
Destroy!

2474
02:53:36,850 --> 02:53:38,910
This is where I can take out all my aggressions.

2475
02:53:42,290 --> 02:53:44,010
Destroy the environment!

2476
02:53:45,290 --> 02:53:45,850
Destroy!

2477
02:53:46,030 --> 02:53:46,290
Destroy!

2478
02:53:47,330 --> 02:53:49,410
They're like, we didn't do anything to you.

2479
02:53:50,030 --> 02:53:52,710
That wasn't even our planet.

2480
02:53:53,250 --> 02:53:54,250
I don't care.

2481
02:53:55,330 --> 02:53:56,190
I don't care.

2482
02:54:00,050 --> 02:54:00,610
Aviva!

2483
02:54:00,930 --> 02:54:01,770
Welcome to the membership.

2484
02:54:01,990 --> 02:54:02,630
Thank you.

2485
02:54:03,970 --> 02:54:05,010
Oh goodness.

2486
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:10,080
Oh no!

2487
02:54:10,180 --> 02:54:12,000
I just noticed those guys over there.

2488
02:54:12,100 --> 02:54:14,640
Maybe I need to just leave?

2489
02:54:18,840 --> 02:54:19,560
No!

2490
02:54:20,500 --> 02:54:21,640
Oh, everything is falling.

2491
02:54:22,600 --> 02:54:24,180
Everything is dying.

2492
02:54:25,520 --> 02:54:28,440
Everything is dying!

2493
02:54:30,140 --> 02:54:30,860
OK,

2494
02:54:35,260 --> 02:54:36,340
so everything must die.

2495
02:54:49,410 --> 02:54:50,190
Everything is dead?

2496
02:54:51,290 --> 02:54:52,850
Oh no, are you kidding me?

2497
02:54:52,970 --> 02:54:54,090
Where did you come from?

2498
02:55:26,910 --> 02:55:28,330
I think I did it?

2499
02:55:30,370 --> 02:55:31,170
A chef!

2500
02:55:35,270 --> 02:55:38,350
Pro-pro-prodigious chef.

2501
02:55:38,730 --> 02:55:40,670
Swine enemies of cockroaches.

2502
02:55:45,680 --> 02:55:51,040
Congratulations on beating that annoying level and an extra special congratulations for your total loss!

2503
02:55:51,220 --> 02:55:52,120
Let's go!

2504
02:55:52,400 --> 02:55:53,660
Oh, that was announced!

2505
02:55:54,320 --> 02:55:54,880
Yippee!

2506
02:55:56,600 --> 02:55:57,160
Yes!

2507
02:55:57,280 --> 02:55:57,880
Oh gosh.

2508
02:55:58,340 --> 02:55:58,940
Oh gosh.

2509
02:55:59,180 --> 02:55:59,700
Oh no.

2510
02:56:01,440 --> 02:56:02,480
Oh no.

2511
02:56:02,820 --> 02:56:03,860
I wonder, oh no.

2512
02:56:04,160 --> 02:56:11,380
If people are like, oh I wonder who she is and then come and see me streaming and I'm like stuck on the bell level screaming.

2513
02:56:13,080 --> 02:56:13,920
Oh no!

2514
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:15,720
That didn't happen though, right?

2515
02:56:19,780 --> 02:56:21,280
That didn't happen though.

2516
02:56:22,660 --> 02:56:24,260
Who is this ghost maid?

2517
02:56:27,080 --> 02:56:32,660
Who's seemingly resemblance, a small resemblance to...

2518
02:56:32,660 --> 02:56:37,160
To Yomu.

2519
02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:40,040
Hello!

2520
02:56:40,800 --> 02:56:41,140
Yeah!

2521
02:56:41,440 --> 02:56:44,680
I got to sing a song.

2522
02:56:44,880 --> 02:56:46,200
It's a cover song.

2523
02:56:46,520 --> 02:56:49,600
And I got to sing a song in total loss world!

2524
02:56:54,260 --> 02:56:55,620
Oh my gosh.

2525
02:56:56,340 --> 02:56:57,980
So excited for it.

2526
02:57:02,240 --> 02:57:07,390
Did they say what song I'm covering?

2527
02:57:08,170 --> 02:57:16,940
Because it's quite... I think it's quite apt honestly.

2528
02:57:21,510 --> 02:57:23,740
Where are you guys coming from?

2529
02:57:35,940 --> 02:57:37,120
I think we did it.

2530
02:57:37,940 --> 02:57:38,640
Let's go.

2531
02:57:40,280 --> 02:57:41,580
It remains a mystery.

2532
02:57:41,740 --> 02:57:42,220
Ok, good.

2533
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:44,300
Perfect!

2534
02:57:44,740 --> 02:57:46,200
Thank you so much for the 50 Gets!

2535
02:57:46,520 --> 02:57:47,320
Thank you!

2536
02:57:48,120 --> 02:57:49,420
Really appreciate it!

2537
02:57:49,460 --> 02:57:50,460
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2538
02:57:55,920 --> 02:57:57,040
Malleable motorist.

2539
02:57:57,480 --> 02:58:00,720
Dreams of becoming a Gran-Tunismo pilot.

2540
02:58:00,720 --> 02:58:01,040
Cute!

2541
02:58:20,560 --> 02:58:22,720
This is one of the...

2542
02:58:28,970 --> 02:58:31,490
One of the challenges, but that's ok.

2543
02:58:31,690 --> 02:58:32,370
I won't do it.

2544
02:58:33,330 --> 02:58:34,830
Oh, there, there, this one, this one, this one.

2545
02:58:35,090 --> 02:58:36,550
Oh no, please no!

2546
02:58:36,930 --> 02:58:38,390
No, no, no!

2547
02:58:38,610 --> 02:58:40,290
No, Crumble Rumble 4!

2548
02:58:40,290 --> 02:58:41,250
No!

2549
02:58:42,650 --> 02:58:43,590
Crumble Rumble 4!

2550
02:58:43,770 --> 02:58:44,130
No!

2551
02:58:44,590 --> 02:58:45,290
Crumble Rumble...

2552
02:58:49,530 --> 02:58:51,430
Oh, it's just these guys.

2553
02:58:53,090 --> 02:58:54,270
Oh, nevermind.

2554
02:58:57,150 --> 02:58:57,830
Oh,

2555
02:59:06,250 --> 02:59:07,390
what the hell?

2556
02:59:11,170 --> 02:59:12,530
Oh, ok, this guy now.

2557
02:59:13,950 --> 02:59:14,870
No, please.

2558
02:59:15,310 --> 02:59:15,650
Please.

2559
02:59:15,650 --> 02:59:15,690
Please.

2560
02:59:22,050 --> 02:59:23,270
First try?

2561
02:59:24,830 --> 02:59:26,070
First try?

2562
02:59:27,170 --> 02:59:27,950
Board nubbler.

2563
02:59:28,270 --> 02:59:29,710
Opposite of a mountain climber.

2564
02:59:33,470 --> 02:59:34,290
Yippee!

2565
02:59:35,290 --> 02:59:38,190
I have a stomachache from the...

2566
02:59:38,860 --> 02:59:40,690
From the first one.

2567
02:59:40,830 --> 02:59:41,910
Goodness gracious.

2568
02:59:44,070 --> 02:59:46,850
I have a stomachache from the other one we did.

2569
02:59:48,990 --> 02:59:49,390
Holy...

2570
02:59:49,390 --> 02:59:50,630
How many more do I need?

2571
02:59:50,750 --> 02:59:51,870
Oh, I'm at 293.

2572
02:59:52,110 --> 02:59:53,790
Where do I get 7 more guys?

2573
02:59:55,010 --> 02:59:55,430
Uh-oh.

2574
02:59:56,510 --> 02:59:57,910
Oh, there's a lot in here!

2575
02:59:58,030 --> 02:59:58,810
Ok, good, good, good.

2576
03:00:01,130 --> 03:00:02,150
Where at though?

2577
03:00:03,350 --> 03:00:05,090
Oh, the genie one!

2578
03:00:09,280 --> 03:00:10,740
Wait, but there's only one here.

2579
03:00:12,420 --> 03:00:12,820
Two...

2580
03:00:18,690 --> 03:00:19,090
Three...

2581
03:00:20,590 --> 03:00:21,290
Uh-oh.

2582
03:00:25,050 --> 03:00:25,730
Uh-oh.

2583
03:00:27,230 --> 03:00:27,670
FFG!

2584
03:00:27,850 --> 03:00:28,970
Thank you so much for the 10 gifts!

2585
03:00:29,530 --> 03:00:30,630
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2586
03:00:31,290 --> 03:00:32,670
Oh, is this a crumble rumble?

2587
03:00:32,930 --> 03:00:33,730
Did I just...

2588
03:00:34,250 --> 03:00:35,630
Did I just come into this?

2589
03:00:39,420 --> 03:00:40,180
Oh my god.

2590
03:00:42,280 --> 03:00:43,160
Just kidding.

2591
03:00:43,420 --> 03:00:43,840
Ok, ok.

2592
03:00:45,860 --> 03:00:47,240
More crumble rumble.

2593
03:00:47,700 --> 03:00:48,520
My favorite.

2594
03:00:48,520 --> 03:00:48,620
My favorite.

2595
03:01:00,980 --> 03:01:02,020
Oh, dang it!

2596
03:01:06,020 --> 03:01:07,700
Speedrunner levels or challenge levels?

2597
03:01:07,780 --> 03:01:08,440
Pick your poison.

2598
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:12,240
I feel the speedrunner will be a little bit more manageable.

2599
03:01:12,680 --> 03:01:18,280
That might be a dumb assumption on my part, but...

2600
03:01:25,720 --> 03:01:29,260
That might be also dumb for trying to just kill these guys normally.

2601
03:01:30,400 --> 03:01:31,560
Oh my gosh!

2602
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:35,480
The ground scenery.

2603
03:01:35,600 --> 03:01:36,860
Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?

2604
03:01:36,940 --> 03:01:37,500
I like it.

2605
03:01:37,520 --> 03:01:38,620
All the neon and everything.

2606
03:01:52,680 --> 03:01:53,640
Oh gosh.

2607
03:01:53,800 --> 03:01:54,260
Oh, two?

2608
03:01:55,040 --> 03:01:55,420
Two?

2609
03:01:55,520 --> 03:01:56,180
What do you mean two?

2610
03:01:56,860 --> 03:01:57,460
Why two?

2611
03:01:58,440 --> 03:02:02,900
Maybe he'll just kill them without me doing anything.

2612
03:02:05,060 --> 03:02:06,480
Minto wins by doing nothing.

2613
03:02:07,700 --> 03:02:08,220
Oh.

2614
03:02:12,280 --> 03:02:16,680
I think... So we learned that the metal safe... or the metal ring is safe, though.

2615
03:02:19,220 --> 03:02:20,640
Except when they do that.

2616
03:02:23,040 --> 03:02:24,760
Except when they attack.

2617
03:02:31,330 --> 03:02:34,210
I think I landed on a guy.

2618
03:02:35,450 --> 03:02:36,690
You asked for that one.

2619
03:02:37,370 --> 03:02:37,690
Maybe.

2620
03:02:52,720 --> 03:02:54,300
Oh my god, that was so close!

2621
03:02:56,660 --> 03:02:57,220
No!

2622
03:03:01,790 --> 03:03:02,870
Oh man.

2623
03:03:04,110 --> 03:03:05,250
That was close, though.

2624
03:03:05,570 --> 03:03:06,370
That was pretty good.

2625
03:03:07,810 --> 03:03:09,110
That was pretty lucky.

2626
03:03:15,670 --> 03:03:17,810
You cannot laser over the bolt, guys.

2627
03:03:17,850 --> 03:03:18,730
You have to punch them.

2628
03:03:19,170 --> 03:03:21,190
You have to spin them like this.

2629
03:03:22,050 --> 03:03:24,170
They die a certain way.

2630
03:03:25,610 --> 03:03:27,830
Yeah, they die a certain way.

2631
03:03:31,050 --> 03:03:31,850
Oh my god!

2632
03:03:32,010 --> 03:03:32,470
Oh my god!

2633
03:03:32,570 --> 03:03:33,090
Oh my god!

2634
03:03:33,390 --> 03:03:33,730
No!

2635
03:03:43,340 --> 03:03:43,860
I

2636
03:03:47,250 --> 03:03:50,750
don't know who exactly I'm having to murder here.

2637
03:03:51,090 --> 03:03:51,730
Oh my god.

2638
03:03:51,990 --> 03:03:52,710
Oh my god.

2639
03:03:52,830 --> 03:03:53,450
Oh my god.

2640
03:03:53,710 --> 03:03:54,450
Oh my god.

2641
03:03:55,690 --> 03:03:56,210
No!

2642
03:04:02,410 --> 03:04:07,710
I don't think it's safe to laser anything because the rocks do so much damage.

2643
03:04:07,790 --> 03:04:10,230
I'm gonna run out of space to...

2644
03:04:10,230 --> 03:04:12,390
I'm gonna run out of space to chill.

2645
03:04:12,810 --> 03:04:14,230
To be able to walk at.

2646
03:04:14,590 --> 03:04:14,970
Right?

2647
03:04:15,630 --> 03:04:16,170
Like...

2648
03:04:16,170 --> 03:04:17,730
I have to be able to walk somewhere.

2649
03:04:19,130 --> 03:04:20,070
Oh my god.

2650
03:04:24,550 --> 03:04:25,630
I feel.

2651
03:04:25,790 --> 03:04:26,870
That's my worry.

2652
03:04:27,070 --> 03:04:28,250
Oh my god, that's my concern.

2653
03:04:35,750 --> 03:04:37,450
How do I get over there?

2654
03:04:54,420 --> 03:04:55,320
Tony Hawk!

2655
03:04:55,420 --> 03:04:55,960
Pro Scanner!

2656
03:05:00,980 --> 03:05:03,020
Minto wins by doing nothing.

2657
03:05:04,040 --> 03:05:06,600
I totally knew that was gonna happen.

2658
03:05:06,840 --> 03:05:07,000
See?

2659
03:05:08,480 --> 03:05:10,380
I totally knew.

2660
03:05:13,900 --> 03:05:16,080
Where are the speedrun levels anyway?

2661
03:05:18,660 --> 03:05:20,360
Where are the speedrun levels?

2662
03:05:21,140 --> 03:05:22,980
Retro Rampage number 5.

2663
03:05:29,320 --> 03:05:30,760
And the Clock Galaxy.

2664
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:31,920
Oh, that's right.

2665
03:05:35,140 --> 03:05:37,080
Hi, I was a Gura that saw you at Hallmat.

2666
03:05:37,180 --> 03:05:38,300
Oh my gosh, Ko-chan!

2667
03:05:39,080 --> 03:05:41,460
I was excited to see Happis and didn't know it was you.

2668
03:05:41,580 --> 03:05:43,280
I was so shy about running up...

2669
03:05:43,280 --> 03:05:44,000
Or running away.

2670
03:05:44,300 --> 03:05:44,900
There was a fan.

2671
03:05:44,960 --> 03:05:46,440
I can't be praised, but I'm grateful to meet you.

2672
03:05:46,980 --> 03:05:48,320
And you said I was cute.

2673
03:05:48,500 --> 03:05:49,000
Oh, it's a Minto!

2674
03:05:49,560 --> 03:05:50,140
Thank you!

2675
03:05:50,500 --> 03:05:51,740
Oh my gosh, you were so cute!

2676
03:05:52,360 --> 03:05:53,380
Don't be shy!

2677
03:05:54,620 --> 03:05:56,600
Thank you for coming to say hi to me!

2678
03:05:57,500 --> 03:05:58,860
I died immediately.

2679
03:06:01,280 --> 03:06:02,400
Thank you!

2680
03:06:11,700 --> 03:06:12,460
Dang it!

2681
03:06:12,540 --> 03:06:13,380
I was so close!

2682
03:06:18,580 --> 03:06:21,160
I don't understand how this one works, to be honest.

2683
03:06:21,760 --> 03:06:24,200
Only some of them fall down into the pit?

2684
03:06:27,780 --> 03:06:28,740
I guess?

2685
03:06:38,680 --> 03:06:40,540
Don't just punch and do nothing.

2686
03:06:43,560 --> 03:06:44,580
Oh my god!

2687
03:06:44,580 --> 03:06:45,000
Ah!

2688
03:06:58,260 --> 03:07:01,940
You can't move when your arms are stretched out.

2689
03:07:02,560 --> 03:07:03,800
So it's kind of annoying.

2690
03:07:04,560 --> 03:07:05,560
Oh gosh!

2691
03:07:06,820 --> 03:07:09,360
Yeah, they are falling in the same order.

2692
03:07:09,700 --> 03:07:11,160
That's why I'm kind of just chilling here.

2693
03:07:13,020 --> 03:07:14,740
I'm just not good at the game.

2694
03:07:16,100 --> 03:07:17,500
I'm just not good at game.

2695
03:07:17,500 --> 03:07:18,400
Oh shoot.

2696
03:07:21,280 --> 03:07:22,640
Oh my god!

2697
03:07:26,470 --> 03:07:27,870
No, this is too tricky!

2698
03:07:29,010 --> 03:07:29,430
Oh my god!

2699
03:07:30,690 --> 03:07:31,230
Oh

2700
03:07:36,820 --> 03:07:37,180
no!

2701
03:07:37,520 --> 03:07:38,300
So close!

2702
03:07:46,620 --> 03:07:48,400
Good smack in the face!

2703
03:07:49,500 --> 03:07:50,340
Oh, dang it.

2704
03:08:04,640 --> 03:08:05,880
Oh my god!

2705
03:08:16,700 --> 03:08:17,580
Spin attack?

2706
03:08:17,760 --> 03:08:19,060
Then why did they give me these?

2707
03:08:19,800 --> 03:08:21,220
These long arms.

2708
03:08:21,400 --> 03:08:23,480
Why did they make me look like Monkey D.

2709
03:08:23,580 --> 03:08:23,800
Luffy?

2710
03:08:24,140 --> 03:08:25,660
If they don't want me to be Monkey D.

2711
03:08:25,720 --> 03:08:26,020
Luffy!

2712
03:08:30,800 --> 03:08:31,240
No!

2713
03:08:35,090 --> 03:08:36,150
Spin while punching?

2714
03:08:44,980 --> 03:08:46,120
Oh, it didn't work.

2715
03:08:54,870 --> 03:08:56,510
Do a spin and then start punching?

2716
03:08:56,630 --> 03:08:57,230
Does it really work?

2717
03:09:02,980 --> 03:09:04,700
I didn't know you could do that with this guy.

2718
03:09:05,760 --> 03:09:06,560
Oh my god.

2719
03:09:07,140 --> 03:09:08,880
I had no idea you could do that with this guy.

2720
03:09:09,080 --> 03:09:09,560
Oh, whoops.

2721
03:09:10,120 --> 03:09:10,360
Why?

2722
03:09:10,500 --> 03:09:11,460
You have no mouth!

2723
03:09:13,060 --> 03:09:13,600
Ah, shit.

2724
03:09:15,020 --> 03:09:16,320
I never knew you could do that!

2725
03:09:21,610 --> 03:09:23,730
I wish it would deflect the attacks though.

2726
03:09:23,910 --> 03:09:24,690
Maybe that's too OP.

2727
03:09:32,380 --> 03:09:33,660
I'm too reckless.

2728
03:09:45,780 --> 03:09:47,800
Oh my god, this guy is still alive.

2729
03:09:48,140 --> 03:09:49,480
Please, die already!

2730
03:09:58,040 --> 03:09:59,280
We did it!

2731
03:10:01,040 --> 03:10:02,260
Who is this guy?

2732
03:10:02,260 --> 03:10:02,900
Oh my god!

2733
03:10:03,540 --> 03:10:05,080
We are getting a nerd!

2734
03:10:07,120 --> 03:10:09,100
Who is this guy?

2735
03:10:09,240 --> 03:10:10,580
Unlucky Salaryman.

2736
03:10:10,920 --> 03:10:11,520
It's just one...

2737
03:10:11,520 --> 03:10:11,820
Oh!

2738
03:10:16,290 --> 03:10:17,870
I know this game!

2739
03:10:18,170 --> 03:10:19,530
This game is so silly!

2740
03:10:20,070 --> 03:10:21,690
I wanted to play this game before.

2741
03:10:21,990 --> 03:10:23,010
Incredible Crisis!

2742
03:10:24,810 --> 03:10:26,710
I wanted to play this game before.

2743
03:10:26,870 --> 03:10:27,090
Yeah!

2744
03:10:32,040 --> 03:10:32,960
It's so funny.

2745
03:10:33,160 --> 03:10:34,440
I can't believe he is in this game.

2746
03:10:36,300 --> 03:10:37,080
Lillie, please.

2747
03:10:38,280 --> 03:10:39,240
Did you say nerd?

2748
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:40,340
Maybe.

2749
03:10:40,340 --> 03:10:41,620
Oh my gosh.

2750
03:10:41,700 --> 03:10:45,260
After this, after the genie's revenge...

2751
03:10:45,260 --> 03:10:46,860
We will have four more.

2752
03:10:47,960 --> 03:10:50,100
Do you think we can get them in the speedrun levels?

2753
03:10:52,320 --> 03:10:53,660
I think maybe.

2754
03:10:56,100 --> 03:10:56,920
Thank you!

2755
03:10:57,720 --> 03:11:00,040
I don't remember how we beat this guy before.

2756
03:11:20,340 --> 03:11:24,180
I hate these guys.

2757
03:11:29,070 --> 03:11:30,070
Oh my god.

2758
03:11:31,730 --> 03:11:32,390
I died.

2759
03:11:33,010 --> 03:11:34,790
One shot, one kill?

2760
03:11:35,050 --> 03:11:35,710
No way.

2761
03:11:37,450 --> 03:11:38,610
Brutal.

2762
03:11:40,490 --> 03:11:41,470
Brutal.

2763
03:11:41,470 --> 03:11:41,630
Oh!

2764
03:11:53,100 --> 03:11:55,900
How am I

2765
03:12:04,560 --> 03:12:07,780
supposed to... I guess I have to use the dogs more.

2766
03:12:23,460 --> 03:12:24,060
No!

2767
03:12:24,060 --> 03:12:24,880
Oh wait!

2768
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:30,020
Oh my god!

2769
03:12:39,800 --> 03:12:40,860
Oh come on.

2770
03:12:41,020 --> 03:12:42,300
Don't be like that.

2771
03:13:06,380 --> 03:13:06,860
Okay.

2772
03:13:07,200 --> 03:13:07,920
Nice suit.

2773
03:13:15,440 --> 03:13:16,660
Please!

2774
03:13:17,400 --> 03:13:18,720
Spare me!

2775
03:13:24,540 --> 03:13:27,720
Spare me the bells please.

2776
03:13:30,320 --> 03:13:33,080
Spare me the bells please.

2777
03:13:33,080 --> 03:13:33,240
Please.

2778
03:13:37,660 --> 03:13:38,760
Oh my god.

2779
03:13:38,860 --> 03:13:40,460
I went to the left.

2780
03:13:40,540 --> 03:13:41,120
I tried.

2781
03:13:42,640 --> 03:13:44,080
Oh my god.

2782
03:13:44,700 --> 03:13:47,760
This is pretty brutal.

2783
03:13:47,980 --> 03:13:48,660
Not gonna lie.

2784
03:13:49,360 --> 03:13:49,760
Oh my god.

2785
03:13:50,280 --> 03:13:52,180
That was so close.

2786
03:13:53,560 --> 03:13:54,620
That was close.

2787
03:13:55,480 --> 03:13:57,440
Guys, guys, guys.

2788
03:13:57,820 --> 03:13:59,340
Guys, let's leave.

2789
03:13:59,740 --> 03:14:01,840
Let's try the speedrun stuff.

2790
03:14:04,640 --> 03:14:07,220
I don't have it in me to deal with those guys anymore.

2791
03:14:07,480 --> 03:14:08,520
Not right now.

2792
03:14:09,040 --> 03:14:10,100
I don't have it in me.

2793
03:14:11,660 --> 03:14:13,200
I don't have it in me right now.

2794
03:14:13,260 --> 03:14:14,160
I don't have it in me.

2795
03:14:15,900 --> 03:14:17,380
I have such a tummy ache.

2796
03:14:18,840 --> 03:14:20,240
Okay, we got everything there.

2797
03:14:20,340 --> 03:14:20,660
Oh here.

2798
03:14:21,080 --> 03:14:22,540
Oh there's ten guys here!

2799
03:14:25,620 --> 03:14:26,800
We can do it!

2800
03:14:27,720 --> 03:14:29,700
You can dog boost to kill the bell.

2801
03:14:29,940 --> 03:14:32,180
Oh, well, not right now.

2802
03:14:32,280 --> 03:14:33,180
I can't do it.

2803
03:14:33,340 --> 03:14:35,260
I don't have it in me.

2804
03:14:35,300 --> 03:14:36,180
I really don't.

2805
03:14:37,200 --> 03:14:41,860
Okay, just because it's called a speedrun level doesn't mean you have to speedrun it.

2806
03:14:42,500 --> 03:14:46,160
Oops, I died.

2807
03:14:50,880 --> 03:14:51,680
Wait, you do?

2808
03:14:52,160 --> 03:14:52,520
Wait.

2809
03:14:54,200 --> 03:14:54,680
Wait.

2810
03:14:57,940 --> 03:14:59,680
I thought you just find them in the level.

2811
03:15:00,020 --> 03:15:00,840
Is that not the case?

2812
03:15:00,840 --> 03:15:01,560
Oh shit.

2813
03:15:01,700 --> 03:15:02,500
Okay, nevermind.

2814
03:15:03,020 --> 03:15:03,980
We are going to die.

2815
03:15:04,260 --> 03:15:04,840
We are going to die.

2816
03:15:05,020 --> 03:15:05,860
We are not going to get anything.

2817
03:15:06,100 --> 03:15:06,860
We are not going to get anything.

2818
03:15:07,320 --> 03:15:08,140
Boost dog!

2819
03:15:08,260 --> 03:15:09,420
Boost dog!

2820
03:15:09,800 --> 03:15:10,400
Boost dog!

2821
03:15:10,780 --> 03:15:11,240
Boost dog!

2822
03:15:12,540 --> 03:15:13,020
Dog!

2823
03:15:14,780 --> 03:15:15,260
Dog!

2824
03:15:15,560 --> 03:15:16,040
Dog!

2825
03:15:16,200 --> 03:15:16,440
Dog!

2826
03:15:19,530 --> 03:15:21,250
You have to get a certain time!

2827
03:15:23,250 --> 03:15:24,050
Oh no.

2828
03:15:24,370 --> 03:15:24,790
No.

2829
03:15:25,090 --> 03:15:27,530
Guys, there's no way I'm going to get enough bots.

2830
03:15:29,870 --> 03:15:32,270
Guys, there's no way I'm going to get enough bots.

2831
03:15:40,010 --> 03:15:41,730
The bird one is easy.

2832
03:15:41,890 --> 03:15:42,970
Who is the bird one?

2833
03:15:52,720 --> 03:15:54,720
Beat one bird in each level.

2834
03:15:55,800 --> 03:15:56,560
What do you mean?

2835
03:15:56,620 --> 03:15:57,020
In here?

2836
03:16:11,120 --> 03:16:12,360
Oh, these guys.

2837
03:16:12,520 --> 03:16:13,660
Oh, I see them.

2838
03:16:21,770 --> 03:16:24,730
Oh my god, he's so... Oh, please dog.

2839
03:16:35,380 --> 03:16:36,900
I see the blue bird.

2840
03:16:36,980 --> 03:16:37,380
I see him.

2841
03:16:37,460 --> 03:16:37,940
I see him.

2842
03:16:37,940 --> 03:16:38,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2843
03:16:40,420 --> 03:16:41,040
Oh shit.

2844
03:16:45,830 --> 03:16:47,250
I'm not good with the dog.

2845
03:16:50,910 --> 03:16:51,390
Okay.

2846
03:16:53,270 --> 03:16:53,750
Speed...

2847
03:16:53,750 --> 03:16:54,130
No!

2848
03:16:54,290 --> 03:16:54,450
Go!

2849
03:16:54,590 --> 03:16:54,710
Go!

2850
03:16:55,230 --> 03:16:55,710
Destrify!

2851
03:17:01,500 --> 03:17:03,040
The blue bird is easy, it says.

2852
03:17:03,120 --> 03:17:04,440
You guys, I didn't get it.

2853
03:17:04,560 --> 03:17:08,420
Obviously, if it's easy, I would have gotten one the first time I tried.

2854
03:17:10,720 --> 03:17:13,340
The first time I spent run, I would have gotten one.

2855
03:17:15,900 --> 03:17:16,480
Go!

2856
03:17:36,880 --> 03:17:38,820
Oh, I think that...

2857
03:17:48,520 --> 03:17:48,960
Ah!

2858
03:17:49,280 --> 03:17:50,380
So close!

2859
03:17:52,240 --> 03:17:54,400
That was so close to beating the red bird.

2860
03:17:54,420 --> 03:17:55,300
He was right there.

2861
03:18:00,480 --> 03:18:01,060
Yay!

2862
03:18:02,000 --> 03:18:02,640
Oh wow!

2863
03:18:04,340 --> 03:18:06,100
Okay, maybe we can do it.

2864
03:18:07,120 --> 03:18:08,560
Maybe we can do it.

2865
03:18:09,240 --> 03:18:09,720
Maybe.

2866
03:18:12,280 --> 03:18:13,500
My stomach hurts.

2867
03:18:14,820 --> 03:18:15,300
Wait.

2868
03:18:17,520 --> 03:18:18,380
There's four.

2869
03:18:18,680 --> 03:18:20,140
There's four worlds left.

2870
03:18:21,240 --> 03:18:22,800
Guys, we might be able to do this.

2871
03:18:23,380 --> 03:18:24,680
We might be able to do this.

2872
03:18:25,940 --> 03:18:26,800
Tell me you weren't real.

2873
03:18:27,040 --> 03:18:28,040
Tell me you weren't real.

2874
03:18:37,460 --> 03:18:38,140
Oh shit.

2875
03:18:38,220 --> 03:18:40,000
Maybe I suck at the...

2876
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:41,700
Maybe I suck at this guy more.

2877
03:18:41,700 --> 03:18:42,380
Shit.

2878
03:18:42,520 --> 03:18:43,080
Oh shit.

2879
03:18:43,200 --> 03:18:44,340
The bird is so fast.

2880
03:18:47,540 --> 03:18:48,280
Oh my god.

2881
03:18:48,480 --> 03:18:49,200
They're flying!

2882
03:18:49,300 --> 03:18:50,040
This is so unfair!

2883
03:18:53,490 --> 03:18:54,430
It's not me!

2884
03:18:57,250 --> 03:18:59,270
Literally, I don't know what's going on!

2885
03:19:00,390 --> 03:19:02,410
Turn off motion control for this one?

2886
03:19:02,550 --> 03:19:03,770
How do you do that?

2887
03:19:06,310 --> 03:19:07,550
Oh my god.

2888
03:19:09,730 --> 03:19:11,050
How do I do that?

2889
03:19:14,680 --> 03:19:15,560
Leave planet.

2890
03:19:15,780 --> 03:19:16,940
Let's try this one last.

2891
03:19:17,120 --> 03:19:18,000
How do I do that?

2892
03:19:23,410 --> 03:19:23,850
R1?

2893
03:19:23,990 --> 03:19:24,330
Okay.

2894
03:19:24,490 --> 03:19:24,990
Oh my god.

2895
03:19:25,510 --> 03:19:26,010
Hold on.

2896
03:19:26,070 --> 03:19:27,310
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

2897
03:19:31,450 --> 03:19:34,450
The bells really made my tummy hurt, you guys.

2898
03:19:34,610 --> 03:19:35,090
I don't know.

2899
03:19:37,810 --> 03:19:38,250
Okay.

2900
03:20:15,360 --> 03:20:17,200
How is he so fast all of a sudden?

2901
03:20:17,200 --> 03:20:18,340
You bitch!

2902
03:20:18,800 --> 03:20:19,780
Get away from me!

2903
03:20:20,620 --> 03:20:21,380
Oh my god.

2904
03:20:22,420 --> 03:20:23,480
What the fuck?

2905
03:20:23,580 --> 03:20:25,060
Oh, my depth perception.

2906
03:20:27,540 --> 03:20:28,500
Oh no.

2907
03:20:29,760 --> 03:20:31,520
Why is he so fast all of a sudden?

2908
03:20:31,620 --> 03:20:33,060
The first level was so fun.

2909
03:20:59,530 --> 03:21:02,250
I hate this one so much.

2910
03:21:02,250 --> 03:21:06,450
Because once you deflate, you have to commit.

2911
03:21:06,570 --> 03:21:08,710
You can't just inflate and deflate.

2912
03:21:08,890 --> 03:21:10,770
It's so fucked up.

2913
03:21:11,330 --> 03:21:12,690
It's so bad!

2914
03:21:29,070 --> 03:21:30,550
I don't know where to go from here.

2915
03:21:38,970 --> 03:21:40,210
I hope I'm going the right way.

2916
03:21:43,090 --> 03:21:44,270
I hope I'm going the right way.

2917
03:22:05,360 --> 03:22:06,520
Okay.

2918
03:22:07,220 --> 03:22:08,600
We did it!

2919
03:22:10,840 --> 03:22:13,500
Get me out of here.

2920
03:22:17,260 --> 03:22:17,800
Okay.

2921
03:22:18,620 --> 03:22:19,240
Nice.

2922
03:22:19,880 --> 03:22:21,820
We got another one.

2923
03:22:23,300 --> 03:22:25,080
Just three more.

2924
03:22:25,600 --> 03:22:27,480
Okay, I'm gonna attempt the monkey again.

2925
03:22:32,540 --> 03:22:33,420
Okay.

2926
03:22:33,420 --> 03:22:34,300
But at what cost?

2927
03:22:34,560 --> 03:22:37,040
I'm losing sanity points so fast here.

2928
03:22:38,140 --> 03:22:40,100
Okay, so R1?

2929
03:22:41,460 --> 03:22:42,240
R1?

2930
03:22:47,610 --> 03:22:52,270
Oh, in settings.

2931
03:22:54,830 --> 03:22:56,590
There is...

2932
03:22:56,590 --> 03:22:57,630
Oh!

2933
03:22:59,510 --> 03:23:02,930
So I use the left stick now?

2934
03:23:07,700 --> 03:23:08,300
Oh, wow.

2935
03:24:29,060 --> 03:24:29,940
Shit, shit, shit!

2936
03:24:30,240 --> 03:24:30,460
No!

2937
03:24:50,630 --> 03:24:52,090
My focus!

2938
03:24:58,460 --> 03:24:59,540
My focus!

2939
03:25:00,360 --> 03:25:01,680
My hands hurt!

2940
03:25:04,160 --> 03:25:06,880
I was so locked in, you guys.

2941
03:25:09,360 --> 03:25:11,220
Pure Minky concentration.

2942
03:25:11,840 --> 03:25:13,660
This is when I pretend I'm not streaming.

2943
03:25:18,100 --> 03:25:19,220
One more!

2944
03:25:20,220 --> 03:25:21,180
Little guy!

2945
03:25:27,520 --> 03:25:28,780
Which one would be easier?

2946
03:25:28,880 --> 03:25:30,420
No, that's some advanced Minky.

2947
03:25:30,960 --> 03:25:31,700
Thank you everybody.

2948
03:25:31,860 --> 03:25:32,360
Thank you.

2949
03:25:39,180 --> 03:25:39,900
Oh, wait.

2950
03:25:39,980 --> 03:25:41,480
Maybe this one is difficult for me.

2951
03:25:41,660 --> 03:25:42,200
We'll see.

2952
03:25:53,760 --> 03:25:54,220
Wait.

2953
03:25:54,380 --> 03:25:55,080
Oh, okay.

2954
03:25:57,340 --> 03:25:58,500
Hey, hey, hey!

2955
03:25:58,900 --> 03:26:00,100
Aren't you supposed to be slow?

2956
03:26:02,680 --> 03:26:03,500
Oh my god!

2957
03:26:03,580 --> 03:26:06,210
I'm not gonna make it!

2958
03:26:06,490 --> 03:26:07,870
This guy is too fast!

2959
03:26:08,570 --> 03:26:09,390
Oh my god.

2960
03:26:19,520 --> 03:26:20,660
I lost it.

2961
03:26:20,800 --> 03:26:21,140
No!

2962
03:26:22,840 --> 03:26:23,900
I lost it.

2963
03:26:29,200 --> 03:26:30,260
Oh, oh.

2964
03:26:31,920 --> 03:26:32,880
Get sharked.

2965
03:26:34,240 --> 03:26:37,800
Oh my god.

2966
03:26:46,660 --> 03:26:46,960
Oh my god.

2967
03:26:47,360 --> 03:26:48,060
Wait, hold on.

2968
03:26:48,240 --> 03:26:51,380
I don't know if this is gonna do anything, but I want this back.

2969
03:26:52,560 --> 03:26:53,040
Wait.

2970
03:26:53,960 --> 03:26:54,440
Oh!

2971
03:26:56,300 --> 03:26:58,280
That's why I was doing so well.

2972
03:26:58,880 --> 03:26:59,560
Okay, nevermind.

2973
03:26:59,600 --> 03:27:00,120
I want this on.

2974
03:27:01,520 --> 03:27:02,000
Nevermind.

2975
03:27:07,600 --> 03:27:09,280
It wasn't me gaming, guys.

2976
03:27:09,760 --> 03:27:10,660
It's okay though.

2977
03:27:27,300 --> 03:27:29,160
I was about to just keep going in there.

2978
03:27:29,420 --> 03:27:29,680
Oh shit.

2979
03:27:31,440 --> 03:27:33,420
I was about to just keep going in there.

2980
03:27:34,160 --> 03:27:34,460
Okay.

2981
03:28:02,700 --> 03:28:03,220
300!

2982
03:28:08,550 --> 03:28:09,830
Oh my god.

2983
03:28:11,370 --> 03:28:14,130
It's already been three and a half hours of craziness.

2984
03:28:14,710 --> 03:28:18,170
You can hear the controller.

2985
03:28:19,870 --> 03:28:20,750
Here we go!

2986
03:28:28,770 --> 03:28:30,050
What could it be?

2987
03:28:30,750 --> 03:28:32,890
I hope it's Mr. PlayStation.

2988
03:28:34,890 --> 03:28:37,010
What if it's Reggie?

2989
03:28:39,430 --> 03:28:41,330
What if it's Mr. Bowser?

2990
03:28:41,690 --> 03:28:44,710
Actually, I don't know a single... I only know Nintendo people.

2991
03:28:46,510 --> 03:28:47,710
John Astro Bot.

2992
03:28:48,150 --> 03:28:49,890
It's Astro Bot's parents.

2993
03:28:50,450 --> 03:28:51,870
It's Astro Bot's mom.

2994
03:28:54,050 --> 03:28:55,730
Geoff Keighley.

2995
03:28:56,850 --> 03:28:58,150
Here we go!

2996
03:28:58,570 --> 03:28:59,030
Everyone!

2997
03:28:59,550 --> 03:29:01,650
Oh my god, this is literally everyone.

2998
03:29:02,150 --> 03:29:05,590
This is every single bot we have.

2999
03:29:06,270 --> 03:29:06,750
Everyone!

3000
03:29:07,570 --> 03:29:08,290
Assemble!

3001
03:29:14,140 --> 03:29:15,280
Hideo Kojima.

3002
03:29:17,080 --> 03:29:17,920
Wait.

3003
03:29:18,520 --> 03:29:19,460
Wait, what just happened?

3004
03:29:22,020 --> 03:29:23,720
Wait, why did you guys leave?

3005
03:29:23,720 --> 03:29:24,900
You guys!

3006
03:29:29,290 --> 03:29:30,570
Oh, I went too far away?

3007
03:29:30,650 --> 03:29:30,870
Okay.

3008
03:29:35,620 --> 03:29:36,820
Alright, Snake, where are you?

3009
03:29:36,900 --> 03:29:38,080
Oh, John Astro...

3010
03:29:38,660 --> 03:29:39,280
Ace Combat!

3011
03:29:39,920 --> 03:29:40,420
Hi Raiden.

3012
03:29:42,740 --> 03:29:43,700
Snake, where are you?

3013
03:29:45,620 --> 03:29:46,820
We're in space?

3014
03:30:04,300 --> 03:30:05,540
This is no time for gaming.

3015
03:30:05,860 --> 03:30:09,360
We're doing an atmospheric intro.

3016
03:30:23,100 --> 03:30:24,400
No.

3017
03:30:25,020 --> 03:30:26,060
No.

3018
03:30:26,740 --> 03:30:27,520
No.

3019
03:30:45,100 --> 03:30:45,750
No.

3020
03:30:46,690 --> 03:30:47,850
No!

3021
03:30:48,470 --> 03:30:49,370
How

3022
03:31:11,670 --> 03:31:14,330
are you supposed to get... Oh, I see it.

3023
03:31:14,390 --> 03:31:14,590
Oh.

3024
03:31:17,070 --> 03:31:18,830
Look down?

3025
03:31:20,990 --> 03:31:22,610
There's nothing below.

3026
03:31:25,030 --> 03:31:26,730
No way.

3027
03:31:44,270 --> 03:31:46,650
This seems doable so far.

3028
03:31:46,670 --> 03:31:47,090
Right.

3029
03:31:48,830 --> 03:31:51,610
I'm not gonna lie, the bird part is...

3030
03:31:52,690 --> 03:31:54,970
The bird part is rough.

3031
03:32:00,700 --> 03:32:03,300
The bird part is rough, I'm not gonna lie.

3032
03:32:05,720 --> 03:32:07,180
And then from there?

3033
03:32:08,140 --> 03:32:09,200
Oh gosh.

3034
03:32:11,180 --> 03:32:15,080
Your reward for gathering all those bosses is that you get to play the hardest level in the game.

3035
03:32:15,180 --> 03:32:20,950
I don't want this.

3036
03:32:21,770 --> 03:32:23,410
I asked for an easy life.

3037
03:32:25,950 --> 03:32:27,150
I don't want this.

3038
03:32:27,210 --> 03:32:28,590
I never asked for this.

3039
03:32:42,880 --> 03:32:43,660
Screw you.

3040
03:33:06,530 --> 03:33:06,970
Okay.

3041
03:33:11,120 --> 03:33:11,820
Oh, come on.

3042
03:33:11,880 --> 03:33:12,040
Come on.

3043
03:33:12,060 --> 03:33:12,400
Come on!

3044
03:33:12,400 --> 03:33:12,900
Come on!

3045
03:33:14,080 --> 03:33:14,640
Yeah!

3046
03:33:16,640 --> 03:33:18,760
That was so dirty.

3047
03:33:18,980 --> 03:33:20,400
That was so dirty.

3048
03:33:20,580 --> 03:33:21,580
We had that.

3049
03:33:22,080 --> 03:33:23,280
We had that.

3050
03:33:23,560 --> 03:33:24,780
That was so dirty.

3051
03:33:25,520 --> 03:33:27,780
I hate that part about the game, honestly.

3052
03:33:32,040 --> 03:33:34,980
That was so... Oh my god.

3053
03:33:37,940 --> 03:33:39,300
What do you mean not really?

3054
03:33:39,360 --> 03:33:40,880
I was literally on top of him.

3055
03:33:43,020 --> 03:33:44,700
I was on him.

3056
03:33:47,070 --> 03:33:48,640
Why can't I smash him?

3057
03:34:06,760 --> 03:34:08,640
I didn't ask for consent.

3058
03:34:10,320 --> 03:34:11,340
You're right.

3059
03:34:23,260 --> 03:34:26,000
So far, not so bad, honestly.

3060
03:34:46,620 --> 03:34:48,260
Okay, that was a skill issue.

3061
03:34:49,720 --> 03:34:51,720
I couldn't see...

3062
03:34:51,720 --> 03:34:55,420
I couldn't see the X underneath.

3063
03:34:57,320 --> 03:34:58,880
I couldn't see it.

3064
03:35:00,060 --> 03:35:01,460
That was a skill issue.

3065
03:35:02,880 --> 03:35:03,320
Oh,

3066
03:35:28,960 --> 03:35:29,480
I had it.

3067
03:35:29,620 --> 03:35:31,400
Oh, I was already... Oops.

3068
03:35:32,040 --> 03:35:32,320
Okay.

3069
03:35:32,560 --> 03:35:33,560
Alright, come on.

3070
03:35:35,160 --> 03:35:37,480
I have to time this just right.

3071
03:35:40,700 --> 03:35:42,240
Oh my god, please.

3072
03:35:42,240 --> 03:35:42,460
Please.

3073
03:35:49,440 --> 03:35:50,160
Please.

3074
03:35:54,470 --> 03:35:54,890
Please.

3075
03:35:58,430 --> 03:36:00,110
Oh my god!

3076
03:36:03,130 --> 03:36:04,370
Screw it.

3077
03:36:06,370 --> 03:36:06,550
Okay.

3078
03:36:19,560 --> 03:36:20,960
And...

3079
03:36:24,160 --> 03:36:25,280
Does he see me?

3080
03:36:25,660 --> 03:36:26,960
Okay, so from there...

3081
03:36:27,760 --> 03:36:30,600
Hold on, I'm viewing since we have a second to view.

3082
03:36:32,480 --> 03:36:35,140
What the hell is this?

3083
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:46,100
Can we do some wall jumping?

3084
03:36:47,220 --> 03:36:48,300
Oh jeez.

3085
03:36:52,940 --> 03:36:53,580
Okay.

3086
03:37:02,510 --> 03:37:04,550
Oh my god, that's like...

3087
03:37:04,550 --> 03:37:07,210
Not pixel perfect, but it has to be pretty perfect.

3088
03:37:12,130 --> 03:37:13,870
Guys, what's the reward for this?

3089
03:37:14,070 --> 03:37:15,310
Just spoil it for me, please.

3090
03:37:16,610 --> 03:37:18,270
I don't want to do this.

3091
03:37:18,910 --> 03:37:20,390
I've been streaming for four hours.

3092
03:37:20,510 --> 03:37:21,270
I'm so tired.

3093
03:37:23,330 --> 03:37:24,010
A bot?

3094
03:37:27,330 --> 03:37:28,310
What is it?

3095
03:37:28,310 --> 03:37:29,670
Who is it?

3096
03:37:30,270 --> 03:37:31,070
Who is... Who?

3097
03:37:31,470 --> 03:37:32,470
What is it?

3098
03:37:32,790 --> 03:37:33,450
Who is it?

3099
03:37:37,900 --> 03:37:38,860
I leave?

3100
03:37:39,300 --> 03:37:39,880
Goodbye?

3101
03:37:41,800 --> 03:37:42,960
I leave.

3102
03:37:43,640 --> 03:37:44,540
I leave.

3103
03:37:45,160 --> 03:37:48,780
I'm sorry, I can't... I didn't... I thought...

3104
03:37:48,780 --> 03:37:55,740
If I had known that getting that was going to be a whole other level, I wouldn't have done it, honestly.

3105
03:37:56,780 --> 03:37:58,200
I wouldn't have done it.

3106
03:37:58,200 --> 03:38:00,220
But we have our nice statue.

3107
03:38:01,380 --> 03:38:02,320
So that's pretty neat.

3108
03:38:02,960 --> 03:38:04,560
That's pretty good, I think.

3109
03:38:05,640 --> 03:38:07,080
I think that's pretty good.

3110
03:38:07,220 --> 03:38:09,320
I think I'm good for now.

3111
03:38:09,720 --> 03:38:13,780
Maybe one day I will feel like doing it.

3112
03:38:13,860 --> 03:38:16,960
But for now, it's been a long day for me.

3113
03:38:17,600 --> 03:38:19,340
And an emotional day for me.

3114
03:38:23,500 --> 03:38:24,080
So...

3115
03:38:27,340 --> 03:38:29,640
Let's do some gacha before we go.

3116
03:38:30,780 --> 03:38:31,360
Punch!

3117
03:38:35,340 --> 03:38:36,620
What's this guy's name?

3118
03:38:36,660 --> 03:38:37,100
I don't remember.

3119
03:38:40,720 --> 03:38:43,980
I'm shocked that's the final bot, but not disappointed.

3120
03:38:46,200 --> 03:38:47,340
Oh no, Tony.

3121
03:38:50,340 --> 03:38:51,580
Destiny, that's right.

3122
03:38:55,850 --> 03:38:59,490
I still feel like I'm going to throw up, so I think I'm going to go eat something.

3123
03:38:59,830 --> 03:39:02,130
I think I had too much water.

3124
03:39:05,270 --> 03:39:05,670
And...

3125
03:39:07,650 --> 03:39:09,010
I was too stressed.

3126
03:39:09,550 --> 03:39:10,770
And I have no food in my tummy.

3127
03:39:11,170 --> 03:39:12,230
Look at him!

3128
03:39:13,770 --> 03:39:15,750
UFOs, giant teddy bears, shrinking children.

3129
03:39:15,910 --> 03:39:16,330
Heck no!

3130
03:39:17,770 --> 03:39:18,570
His shinbun.

3131
03:39:19,910 --> 03:39:20,390
Do

3132
03:39:24,730 --> 03:39:26,070
I have enough to finish it?

3133
03:39:28,610 --> 03:39:29,090
Maybe.

3134
03:39:30,310 --> 03:39:34,350
Sorry the 300 bot reward turned out to be a bust, but you gamed hard today.

3135
03:39:34,430 --> 03:39:34,910
Be proud.

3136
03:39:35,350 --> 03:39:36,050
Thank you!

3137
03:39:37,410 --> 03:39:39,610
Obviously I love this game, so I still had fun.

3138
03:39:39,770 --> 03:39:41,050
It's just...

3139
03:39:41,050 --> 03:39:41,930
Game.

3140
03:39:42,870 --> 03:39:44,270
The game is so cruel.

3141
03:39:45,690 --> 03:39:47,230
The game is so cruel.

3142
03:39:51,440 --> 03:39:53,540
Nothing guilty about this gear.

3143
03:40:01,750 --> 03:40:03,530
Go enjoy a good meal.

3144
03:40:03,770 --> 03:40:04,330
I will.

3145
03:40:05,890 --> 03:40:07,270
I'm going to go relax.

3146
03:40:07,510 --> 03:40:10,010
Especially because tomorrow I have the game 2.

3147
03:40:10,690 --> 03:40:11,490
Maybe I'll switch.

3148
03:40:12,610 --> 03:40:12,910
No.

3149
03:40:14,010 --> 03:40:15,410
Maybe I'll do Devil May Cry.

3150
03:40:15,650 --> 03:40:16,650
Maybe I'll... I don't know.

3151
03:40:19,410 --> 03:40:23,730
Maybe I just won't play as long as I intended to tomorrow.

3152
03:40:24,470 --> 03:40:25,510
We'll see how I'm feeling.

3153
03:40:26,830 --> 03:40:29,510
It's a sensitive week for me, you guys.

3154
03:40:31,530 --> 03:40:32,970
It's a sensitive week.

3155
03:40:34,330 --> 03:40:34,870
So...

3156
03:40:36,490 --> 03:40:40,610
I'm going to go get some rest and I suggest you guys do too.

3157
03:40:42,010 --> 03:40:43,730
I will see you guys.

3158
03:40:43,730 --> 03:40:46,490
But we got 300 guys!

3159
03:40:46,590 --> 03:40:48,590
We got 300 guys and we got all the puzzle pieces.

3160
03:40:49,510 --> 03:40:52,210
Maybe one day we will return to the final challenge.

3161
03:40:54,010 --> 03:40:55,050
Maybe one day.

3162
03:40:55,970 --> 03:40:58,190
The final challenge will be ours.

3163
03:41:02,390 --> 03:41:04,450
I'll see you guys later!

3164
03:41:04,990 --> 03:41:05,470
Otsumito!

3165
03:41:05,670 --> 03:41:07,090
Thank you guys for the stream!

3166
03:41:07,210 --> 03:41:07,630
Otsumito!

3167
03:41:07,710 --> 03:41:07,990
Otsumito!

3168
03:41:08,330 --> 03:41:09,170
Bye-bye!

3169
03:41:09,470 --> 03:41:09,770
Bye-bye!

3170
03:41:09,930 --> 03:41:10,150
Bye-bye!

3171
03:41:10,150 --> 03:41:11,010
Bye-bye!

3172
03:41:44,220 --> 03:41:45,220
Oh my god.

3173
03:41:45,560 --> 03:41:47,020
In the end, it's actually maybe good.

3174
03:41:47,520 --> 03:41:48,140
My controller

3175
03:41:58,720 --> 03:42:00,640
into oblivion.

3176
03:42:01,800 --> 03:42:02,280
OK bye!
