1
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,220
I'm ready to lose my money!

2
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,560
Let's go gambling!

3
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,320
Ah dang it.

4
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,480
Ah dang it.

5
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:31,920
Welcome.

6
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,200
Welcome to me fighting for my afterlife... in Toreba.

7
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,460
A system I have never used before.

8
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,200
I know people that have...

9
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,520
So I know that it is not...

10
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,600
It won't...

11
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,720
Scam me, maybe.

12
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,480
Just the claw machines, maybe.

13
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,700
Should have gotten a headband for your model too.

14
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,660
Hey, I like this one.

15
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,140
I made it myself.

16
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,200
Chill out.

17
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,860
Chill out.

18
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,280
I like this one.

19
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,020
It's been months, but I've finally gotten over my anime figure and Pokemon plushie crane games addiction.

20
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,000
Mint starts playing Toreba.

21
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,540
No, don't do it!

22
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:34,680
Don't do it!

23
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,730
I like this headband.

24
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,270
Thank you very much.

25
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,310
Thank you!

26
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,150
Happy Kami Oshiri day.

27
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,110
Thanks.

28
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,190
You're ready to lose our money.

29
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,990
Highly debated.

30
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,770
Because, okay, they have these on Mercari.

31
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,070
Okay, hold on.

32
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,170
Let me start at the very beginning.

33
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,070
Also, sorry Ashes, you did not win the gacha.

34
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,170
My town dodged 5 to 6 tornadoes.

35
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,310
Are you okay?

36
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,610
I think you need to move.

37
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,750
Or wait, maybe you need to stay, because your town is lucky.

38
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,070
It's my first stream.

39
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:27,970
Welcome!

40
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,310
Welcome!

41
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,150
Okay, let me explain from the beginning.

42
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:45,970
So, when they announced these Metal Gear crane game items...

43
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,110
a while ago, some time ago.

44
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,990
And they said that they would start in October.

45
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,770
So I was like, okay.

46
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,590
I was in October.

47
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,310
On October 1st.

48
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,990
And I went all over Akihabara.

49
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,410
I went to every single place that I could find.

50
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,150
Every single arcade in Akihabara.

51
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,970
That with a crane game.

52
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,190
And none of them had it.

53
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,570
And I was very sad and very disappointed.

54
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,970
She was in October.

55
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,890
Wait, is that what I said?

56
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,450
Oh, wait.

57
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,110
I was in...

58
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,970
I was in Japan in October.

59
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,650
You guys know what I meant.

60
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,590
Shut up.

61
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,250
Fellow Oklahoma-me.

62
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,330
Stay safe, you guys.

63
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,030
Oh my gosh.

64
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,270
But I was in Japan in October and I went all over the place.

65
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,910
I searched for hours.

66
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,450
Nothing.

67
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,630
I was so disappointed.

68
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,710
You know when these bad boys came out?

69
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,470
Oh, wait.

70
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,890
Maybe it wasn't these.

71
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,710
Maybe it was...

72
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,420
When did the tumblers start?

73
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,900
I know that the gacha machine, the gachapon one started...

74
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,830
Now I don't know.

75
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,990
What?

76
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,970
Well, regardless.

77
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,430
One of them, they released Metal Gear gachapons and they released these Metal Gear tumblers.

78
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,770
And they both...

79
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,830
Or maybe not both.

80
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,230
I don't know anymore.

81
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,430
One of them started on October 31st.

82
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,810
Which I'm like, seriously?

83
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,050
You're gonna say that it starts in October?

84
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,670
And then have it start on the final day of Octumber?

85
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,450
Oct...

86
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,510
Not Tumblr.

87
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,830
October...

88
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,630
Tumblr.

89
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,830
Yeah, they're tumblers.

90
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,510
You know, Tumblr cups?

91
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,250
You know the things that came before the website, you brain-rotted individuals?

92
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,810
Get off the internet, Octumbr!

93
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,650
Stop!

94
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,110
My god.

95
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,630
RT Ronin, thank you so much for the 20th.

96
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,190
What she puts on the head, man.

97
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,690
The brain rot takes over.

98
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,750
I can't believe I said that.

99
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,170
I've got Tumblr on the brain.

100
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,970
Metal Gear Tumblr's on the brain.

101
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,750
And so I went and checked Mercari.

102
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,850
Which as I do near daily, I see what Metal Gear things are on Mercari.

103
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,150
Almost every day.

104
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,430
And I went and I checked and I was like, I wonder if they have the Tumblrs.

105
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,730
And they do, obviously.

106
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,250
They had them up very quickly.

107
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,850
They had all four.

108
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,890
There's four of them.

109
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,650
They have one for Metal Gear.

110
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,190
One for Metal Gear Solid.

111
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,770
One for Metal Gear Solid 2.

112
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,370
And one for Metal Gear Solid 3.

113
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,610
Which one for Metal Gear is like huge.

114
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,190
Like first Metal Gear, that's crazy.

115
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,270
But they had them all for about 60 bucks.

116
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,490
Which I was like, that's really not bad.

117
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,090
I would spend so much more trying to get just one, probably.

118
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,270
And then I was like, yeah, but I have no satisfaction.

119
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,570
And so, you know, I want to win it myself.

120
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,910
I've never... I think I've won maybe one thing out of a crane game before.

121
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,810
And so I was just like, well, let me see.

122
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,790
I only know of Toreba.

123
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,970
I was like, I'll see if they have it.

124
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,570
And lo and behold...

125
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,470
It's the only thing I've ever searched on this website.

126
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,090
Look at this.

127
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,010
Oh my gosh, go away, advertisement.

128
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,510
Look at this.

129
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,590
Wait, why is this so expensive?

130
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,130
Why is it 4,000 TP?

131
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:17,850
What is a TP?

132
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,950
That's what I bought.

133
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,210
I bought 60 dollars worth of a TP.

134
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,030
Let's go tumbling.

135
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,050
Why are some of them different amounts?

136
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,570
I'm confused.

137
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,710
I've never played this website before.

138
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:42,850
Two.

139
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,650
Are you ready to sell your already dead soul to the Toreba demons?

140
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,470
Maybe.

141
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,050
Higher amount, easier game to win.

142
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,750
It's pay to win.

143
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,450
Wait, actually?

144
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,070
Different crane game difficulty?

145
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,970
Biggest advice I can give on Toreba is always go for the assist cranes.

146
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,130
With enough time and credits, you can brute force win prizes eventually.

147
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,270
Who was I with?

148
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,870
I was with Emuri in Japan.

149
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,950
And she tried getting a...

150
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,610
A Oshinoko plushie.

151
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,590
And with our powers combined...

152
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,570
The assistant had to literally put the doll on the edge.

153
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,830
The assistant had to come and put the doll literally on...

154
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,590
Like, so that it was tilting into...

155
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,990
So it was tilting into...

156
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,970
The exit.

157
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,670
The bowl.

158
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,810
What did you call it?

159
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,330
The hole.

160
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,610
So nice and condescending at the same time.

161
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,310
I know!

162
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,070
I don't know if that's great or sad.

163
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,970
It was very sad.

164
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,710
And guess what?

165
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,190
We didn't get it.

166
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,250
And they had to go set it up again.

167
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,390
We didn't even get it!

168
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,730
And we had to set it up.

169
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,230
We had to ask them to set it up one more time.

170
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,330
Wait, so...

171
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,740
So...

172
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,120
This...

173
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,820
This is the assist help.

174
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,020
Why is this a...

175
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:24,880
4000.

176
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,420
What happened?

177
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,400
OK, let's see what it is.

178
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,480
Oh my gosh!

179
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,420
It's a takoyaki!

180
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,900
Wait, so I pick up the balls and then I drop it and I have to get it into the center?

181
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,480
But it's 4000!

182
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:43,920
4000!

183
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,100
Supposedly those are easier.

184
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,320
They are not.

185
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,260
Look at this!

186
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,960
What if I get it first try though?

187
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,320
Wait, is this live?

188
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:56,640
Yeah!

189
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,880
I get to try in real time!

190
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,920
4k toilet paper.

191
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,460
If it lands in the ring then you win.

192
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,400
Right in the middle?

193
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,660
Eventually I would have to get it.

194
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,620
Wait, what's 4?

195
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,200
OK, hold on.

196
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,400
50,000... Calculator.

197
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,600
50,000...

198
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,520
Divided by 4.

199
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,180
Oh wait, sorry.

200
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,660
50,000...

201
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,500
Divided by 4,000.

202
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,600
I would only have 12 tries.

203
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,700
About.

204
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,840
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11...

205
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,080
12, 13, 14, 15, 16...

206
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,840
There's 17 holes open!

207
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,660
There's more than 12 holes!

208
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,660
You guys, what if I end up spending like 60 dollars on... on what?

209
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,400
That would be ridiculous.

210
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,420
They can also stack on each other.

211
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:13,760
No!

212
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,980
They can't, they're balls!

213
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,000
Sorry.

214
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,920
Oh my god!

215
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,000
Who's using it?

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,700
Oh

217
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,160
my god.

218
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,440
Who's... Who's playing on this one?

219
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,080
Stop, it's mine!

220
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,140
You will get sniped?

221
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,220
No, you guys, stop it!

222
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,620
Don't snipe me, please!

223
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,700
I'm kind of invested in their progress though.

224
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,860
What if I press play?

225
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,640
Oh my gosh!

226
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,480
You suck!

227
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:56,860
Boo!

228
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,980
Get off the crate!

229
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,160
Boo!

230
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:01,940
Boo!

231
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,000
You suck!

232
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,520
Fill up the empty ones so she can one-shot.

233
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,880
Wait, what do you mean by that?

234
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,340
No!

235
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,420
Don't fill them up!

236
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,120
Oh, they're trying again.

237
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,960
Is there someone in chat?

238
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,980
Oh my gosh!

239
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,420
Oh, you got really unlucky.

240
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
You got really unlucky.

241
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,720
Okay.

242
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,840
Okay, I want to start in order though, right?

243
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,500
Currently in use!

244
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,840
These were all free until just now!

245
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,620
Are you kidding me right now?

246
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,000
No way.

247
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,860
I want to start from metal gear and then go up and up and up.

248
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,700
Sniping isn't entirely bad because they just use their credits and give up.

249
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,600
That just makes things easier for us to win.

250
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,780
Maybe.

251
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,140
Should I wait?

252
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,560
These ones have always been currently in use.

253
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,060
Ever since I checked on the site the first time.

254
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,850
Okay, I'm going to try this one.

255
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,950
They're still going.

256
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,670
That was so close!

257
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,790
Wait, what if I press play?

258
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,230
Okay, I'm in the...

259
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,290
There's music?

260
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,010
Holy loud.

261
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,050
Oh my God.

262
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,010
How

263
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,870
many times are they going to go?

264
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,430
I can't even switch the camera.

265
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:43,470
Yeah, fill it up until you have no more points.

266
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,210
It's so loud!

267
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,070
How do I turn it off?

268
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,900
Am I cute today?

269
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,380
Trick question, because it's always true.

270
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,960
Oh, am I cute today?

271
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,880
Camera debuff.

272
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,100
Oh my gosh.

273
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,180
How long are they going to go for?

274
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,480
The settings button?

275
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,020
Oh, here?

276
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,440
Please shut up.

277
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,660
I'm going to turn this down too.

278
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,080
What's that stamp?

279
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,320
Okay, now we can have our music back.

280
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,300
My jazzy music.

281
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,440
Guess who absolutely destroyed his Calculus 2 final today?

282
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,320
Thank you for existing.

283
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,360
Evan!

284
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,780
Let's go!

285
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,060
Congrats!

286
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,580
Can I turn now?

287
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,500
Minto turn, please!

288
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,540
I'm the one in the queue though.

289
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,440
I'm the one in the queue.

290
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,020
Are you done?

291
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,660
They are going to take it, you guys.

292
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
I bet this person is not even a fan.

293
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,700
This person just wants to be a reseller.

294
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,920
This person is just a Metal Gear Tumbler reseller.

295
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,860
Sending you my birthday luck with Big Minto.

296
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,420
Thank you!

297
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,740
Happy birthday!

298
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,980
Happy birthday to you!

299
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,020
Happy birthday to you!

300
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,100
Happy birthday Yamuha!

301
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,560
Happy birthday to you!

302
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,960
Happy birthday!

303
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,930
Guys, I don't know if I'm going to be able to play.

304
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,010
I think this person is serious.

305
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,410
If you are watching this stream, can you actually let me try?

306
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,610
Oh my god.

307
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,010
Oh my god.

308
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,490
If you end up winning it, I'm going to be so upset.

309
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,710
Let me try.

310
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,030
Let me in.

311
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,990
There can't be this many people who want... There's three people mining!

312
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,390
Who is this?

313
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,110
Bob said it's my turn on the MGS claw machine.

314
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,530
We're just watching this person.

315
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,170
This actually would be me probably.

316
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,730
Starting to trigger my trypophobia.

317
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,350
I don't have that though.

318
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,790
Chat's the one playing.

319
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,130
Eventually something will... Eventually I'll get to play.

320
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,310
Right?

321
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,250
But what if they fill it all up?

322
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,750
Oh my god.

323
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,150
Stop making snowmen!

324
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,950
Play the game properly!

325
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,660
School issue.

326
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,680
I want to play.

327
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,600
Maybe I should just go for the claw games.

328
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,820
I'm scared.

329
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:02,880
I'm scared.

330
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,560
I

331
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,270
hope your package gets lost in the maze!

332
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:34,950
Man.

333
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,210
They tried 15 times.

334
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,090
Is that really how long it took them?

335
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,830
Cursed by the ghost man.

336
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,090
I guess let's leave.

337
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,590
I wanted to try that one.

338
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,150
Man.

339
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,370
Man.

340
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,710
Maybe this was a bad stream idea.

341
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,430
Maybe I'm just gonna go to Bergaria.

342
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,910
Maybe I'm wasting my money.

343
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,650
Let's see.

344
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,490
I guess we'll try this one.

345
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,150
Or what's the difference between...

346
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,370
So this is technically an easier one.

347
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,730
Let's try.

348
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,830
Let's look at this one.

349
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,770
What kind of thing is this?

350
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,690
It's the same thing!

351
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,890
It's the same one!

352
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,970
Play, but it's cheaper!

353
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,710
Ok, here we go guys.

354
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,590
John, welcome to Mambo Ship!

355
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,210
Ok, here we go.

356
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,270
Start.

357
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,870
Oh my gosh!

358
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,630
Wait, how do...what do you mean?

359
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:46,990
What?

360
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,670
I just go over?

361
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,390
Huh?

362
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,590
Wait, I just press over?

363
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,050
Wait...huh?

364
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,250
I'm confused.

365
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,390
I only have 15 remaining.

366
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,210
What do I do?

367
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:00,930
Huh?

368
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,030
Just tap.

369
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,770
Oh.

370
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,230
Huh?

371
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,450
Oh, that's really confusing.

372
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,240
I hate this one.

373
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,380
I'm leaving.

374
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,360
I hate this one.

375
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,020
It's supposed to be...

376
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,880
Let me out of here!

377
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,640
Someone else can play it.

378
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,800
Get me out of here.

379
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,960
Oops, I think I went too far.

380
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,120
The rage quit.

381
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,880
In order to operate the crane and get the ball into the hole, press the action button.

382
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,840
Maybe they reset the other one.

383
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,440
I don't think I want to pay...

384
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,420
I can't even guarantee grabbing a ball.

385
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,520
Skill issue.

386
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,160
Holy moly.

387
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,500
Wait, these are all in use.

388
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,120
You motherfuckers!

389
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,220
Get out of my stream!

390
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,340
I should have never done this.

391
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,460
Now I won't be able to try a single time because you assholes are like...

392
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,620
What if I try instead?

393
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:54,660
I know Minto is trying to make content, but what if I just instead do it?

394
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,880
Get out of here!

395
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,560
There's two people...

396
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,140
Oh wait, this one is like...

397
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,920
This is even more difficult!

398
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,280
Oh my gosh, what?

399
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,780
How are you supposed to grab it with a single hook?

400
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,120
What?

401
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,300
This is the cheap one?

402
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,240
Why didn't I do any...

403
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,420
Nine remaining!

404
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,040
You guys, there's no way.

405
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,440
Please.

406
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,060
You guys, this is...

407
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,520
There's only nine.

408
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,960
Who is grabbing these?

409
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,220
You don't grab, you push.

410
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,900
Wait, what do you mean?

411
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,360
You just push the box over?

412
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,700
Guilty in taking one.

413
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,060
I give you a break with the eShop codes.

414
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,680
There is no mercy today.

415
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:02,260
I know, I literally cried about how good you guys were the other day.

416
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,680
And now...

417
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,720
Now you...

418
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,280
Wait, now there's three people waiting.

419
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,040
Now there's seven people browsing.

420
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,420
Oh my goodness.

421
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,620
Should I get in line?

422
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,780
Ok, I'm in line.

423
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,460
Ok, you can stop playing now.

424
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,120
I don't think it's moved at all.

425
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,220
I understand your anger, but I really want one.

426
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,520
How about you go to Mercari and buy it, ok?

427
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,460
Actually don't, because I'm gonna have to purchase them anyway on Mercari.

428
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,660
Thank you.

429
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,440
So excited for the Mercari JP browsing stream.

430
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,260
You'll just see my history, recent history is just Metal Gear, Metal Gear, Metal Gear, sometimes Idols, Metal Gear, Metal Gear.

431
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,320
I can't even tell if you're taking this seriously.

432
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,160
I think you're wasting your money, buddy.

433
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,080
I think you got...

434
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,980
I think you got it, come on.

435
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,620
It's time to stop.

436
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,620
It's not coming home.

437
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,820
Oh my gosh.

438
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,540
Maybe this guy has... Maybe, yeah.

439
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,020
Maybe I shouldn't do this one since I have bad depth perception and this guy probably does too.

440
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,180
This one looks really hard.

441
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,260
I'll give up my machine once I win three more.

442
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,540
What a nice five round.

443
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,700
I believe in you, Mint.

444
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,320
You got this.

445
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,340
Thank you, Prince.

446
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,700
Oh my gosh, this is so funny.

447
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,780
I think the Wisps are saving you from gambling.

448
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,860
We're nice.

449
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,180
Oh my gosh, you tickled it!

450
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,340
You did it!

451
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,870
Nice, nice, nice.

452
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,950
Nice tickle.

453
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,150
What does assist 65 play mean?

454
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,170
They come and help you after 65 plays?

455
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,310
Oh my gosh, they did it again!

456
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,310
Maybe they were just...

457
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,310
Maybe before they were like...

458
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,530
They were hiding their power level, you know?

459
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,190
No depth perception because of the eyepatch.

460
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,990
The hand of God.

461
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,190
Do you think the other ones reset?

462
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,250
The 4000 ones?

463
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,790
I really want to try.

464
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,710
How is it not moving even a single bit?

465
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,490
How is it not moving even just a tiny, tiny bit?

466
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:19,690
I was listening to your summer podcast and got to the second one about the Minotaur while I was driving.

467
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,770
I learned so much.

468
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,670
Well, first off, thank you.

469
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,830
How do I say?

470
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,270
Arsloads?

471
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:29,750
Arsloads?

472
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,090
Thank you for listening.

473
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,330
Glad you learned so much.

474
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,850
The loop is a trap, so you actually just have to push it?

475
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:47,030
You just, like, push it over with the hand instead?

476
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:51,250
I wish there was a chat in this so I could, like...

477
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,210
I could be like, push it instead!

478
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,650
Don't go for the loop, it's a trap!

479
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,970
That looked really promising, though.

480
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:06,030
I know the goal is MGS today, but the Hello Kitty cardcaptor Sakura plush on the front page is pretty cute.

481
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,330
I know, they always have such cute stuff.

482
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,230
Wait a second, hold on, I'm getting DMs.

483
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,490
Oh shoot.

484
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,170
Oh.

485
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,490
My.

486
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,610
God.

487
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:26,050
One of my friends is really good at crane games.

488
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,330
And this asshole...

489
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:34,050
Types in the group chat, can't believe I had to take off work to stream snipe someone in Toreba.

490
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:38,450
No!

491
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,820
Oh my god!

492
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,240
I can't believe this!

493
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,560
My friend, she was like, I saw the stream and was like, oh no, Minto.

494
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,440
This is so messed up.

495
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,600
Everybody, even my own friends are stream sniping me!

496
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,800
My own friends are stream sniping me!

497
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,360
I can't believe this.

498
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,440
The betrayal.

499
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,990
Oh man, I can't believe this.

500
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,990
We're just sitting here, this guy has probably wasted like a hundred dollars at this point.

501
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,710
And it hasn't moved an even centimeter.

502
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,470
Oh god.

503
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,510
What?

504
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,710
65 plays.

505
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,390
Friend.

506
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:55,390
I'm in tears watching this.

507
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,270
Oh my god!

508
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,070
Stop guys!

509
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,420
I can't.

510
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,610
I'm watching someone go into madness.

511
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,570
I can't.

512
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,710
They're so determined.

513
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,590
But it doesn't work.

514
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,050
I'm in literal tears right now.

515
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,510
Oh my god.

516
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,110
Good content, Minto.

517
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,090
No, I'm not even a tickle.

518
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,650
Let's see the side view, everybody.

519
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:47,890
Oh my gosh.

520
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,810
It doesn't... Oh my god, here they go again.

521
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,270
Oh ok, nevermind, that's it.

522
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,230
Going back to the center.

523
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,390
Alright, let's see you go.

524
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,710
Oh wait!

525
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,510
Is it a different person?

526
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,470
Did they give up?

527
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,050
No!

528
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,290
Oh no, I'm position one now.

529
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,910
I don't think I want to try this one.

530
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:25,690
Wait, what was that?

531
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,430
Was that a sticker?

532
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,010
If you're getting stream sniped, it's time to add delay.

533
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,390
Competitive crane gaming.

534
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:35,950
What?

535
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,730
That's so cute.

536
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:39,450
Wait.

537
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,550
Oh my gosh, I did one too!

538
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,490
These are little stickers down here.

539
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,950
Oh my gosh, how cute.

540
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,270
Is there such thing as an absolute timeless friend?

541
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,310
Yeah, the mascots are very cute.

542
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,850
Ok, you guys, let's strategize.

543
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,510
So, when it's my turn, what do I aim for?

544
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,250
Do I aim for...

545
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,810
What if I can't get it as far as to push it, you know?

546
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,040
What if I can't get it as far as to push it, you know?

547
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,640
Try budging it in the corner.

548
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,200
Like, on the plastic tab hole.

549
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,020
It's my turn!

550
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,200
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

551
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,960
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

552
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,140
It's my turn!

553
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,340
Wait, I'm scared.

554
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,520
I'm scared.

555
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,440
The screen can only do the tag.

556
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,360
Got it?

557
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,700
Aim for the edges of the loop.

558
00:33:59,780 --> 00:33:59,960
Oh,

559
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,710
I think I went too far.

560
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:15,860
What?

561
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,240
Oh, where did I hit?

562
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,520
Wait, oh wait, I didn't get this!

563
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,020
I didn't get it.

564
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,000
There's a lag too, yeah, yeah.

565
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:33,880
Boing!

566
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,740
I don't know if I...

567
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,380
If I...

568
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,220
Oh gosh.

569
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,460
OK, I'm looking at the...

570
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,890
I was not too far enough.

571
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,190
Over.

572
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:52,570
OK.

573
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,910
The arm doesn't open up very wide.

574
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,030
I probably should have been studying the last guy.

575
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,290
I probably should have studied what he was doing...

576
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,790
Instead of just making fun of him the whole time.

577
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:09,630
OK.

578
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,140
Turn!

579
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,280
Oh, turn!

580
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,820
I'm gonna go for the inner.

581
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,600
Wait, I think my...

582
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,540
My thing lagged!

583
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,620
I got scammed for real!

584
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:38,640
No!

585
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,360
Of course they have no angry ones here.

586
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,980
That was such a bad lag!

587
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,840
No way!

588
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,240
Stop!

589
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,780
You guys suck!

590
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,620
I wonder if the other one is reset.

591
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,260
Guys, I'm not an idiot like that first person.

592
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,400
I know when to quit.

593
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,040
Because it's a scam.

594
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,520
Wait.

595
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,220
This Miku is so cute.

596
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,720
What else do they have up here?

597
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,740
What is this?

598
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,100
Cute.

599
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,530
Oh my gosh.

600
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,770
What's a metal cleaner?

601
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,630
Rude camera!

602
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,830
Get the shark outfit?

603
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,610
I want the giant shark costume, please.

604
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,750
You don't want the duck pajama?

605
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,350
I also like the boo sensor light.

606
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,510
These are really cute.

607
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,570
The card capture sakura.

608
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,830
And then the Minecraft...

609
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,210
You guys are kind of blocking it, but the Minecraft plushies.

610
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,010
Teresa.

611
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,730
Teresa, Teresa.

612
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,050
This is nice.

613
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:03,890
Multi-rack.

614
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,890
What is this?

615
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,890
Storage style compact heater?

616
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,270
That would be perfect for winter.

617
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,950
An avocado.

618
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,310
Thanks.

619
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,210
This Yui is so cute.

620
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,610
Okay, I'm not getting... I'm resetting my eyeballs.

621
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,990
Miku noodle stopper.

622
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,190
More giant shark.

623
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:38,670
I'm convinced nobody wins those and actually everybody just goes for the 4000 ones.

624
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,810
I think that's the meta.

625
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,570
I'm convinced nobody actually wins the crane games.

626
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:47,890
Exodia.

627
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,310
Oh my gosh.

628
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:54,190
I got a package recently from...

629
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,770
What con was it?

630
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,790
I think it was the Texas convention I did.

631
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:05,090
I finally got the fan letters and things like that from that.

632
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,390
And someone gifted me a bunch of Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

633
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,890
And for the first time ever, I own all of Exodia because of that.

634
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,130
So if you were the one who gifted me all of Exodia, thank you.

635
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,790
I was like opening it and I was like...

636
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:29,690
Like it first started with the hand and I was like...

637
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,010
No way.

638
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,170
It was so good.

639
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:34,770
Okay.

640
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,640
Play!

641
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,460
Alright guys, I know it's 4000.

642
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,480
Oh my gosh, it's completely empty.

643
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,340
That person robbed me.

644
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,020
Okay, start.

645
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,600
Is that all I do?

646
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
I'm scared.

647
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,960
Wait, how do I move it?

648
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,100
Where do I move it to?

649
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,780
Okay.

650
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:14,820
Oh

651
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,810
my gosh, I'm feeling the rush.

652
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,150
I'm feeling the high.

653
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,610
Oh my god!

654
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:27,910
Please!

655
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,320
Oh my gosh, it was so close!

656
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,100
You guys see that?

657
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,400
M That was so close.

658
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,080
Pure skill there.

659
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,780
Yeah, this is the skill.

660
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,700
This is the skill.

661
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,800
Oh my gosh, I almost didn't get a ball.

662
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,900
I feel like the scam with this one is that it's very easy to grab the ball.

663
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,940
No, I think you end up spending probably less money on this.

664
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,040
Just because...

665
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,360
It eventually has to go in, whereas...

666
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,370
Which way does it move when I do this?

667
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,870
Which way does it move?

668
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:34,870
I can't tell.

669
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,410
Okay, I have to go back more.

670
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,970
That was so mean.

671
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,560
Holy moly, it was so close!

672
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,880
Show me the back!

673
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,500
Thank you.

674
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,310
You guys stop it.

675
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,310
What did I...Why are you making fun...

676
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,190
So close!

677
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,790
So close!

678
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,310
So close.

679
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,930
Show me the back!

680
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:31,110
Okay, nice.

681
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,470
It's designed to give you hope, Minto.

682
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,230
Then take more than any other game?

683
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,210
I don't think so.

684
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,230
I think I would spend way more money on the crane.

685
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,150
How

686
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,800
much is that tumbler in total?

687
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,200
100 maintenance.

688
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,560
Restocking prize.

689
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,700
Prize confirmation?

690
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,180
Hold on.

691
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:18,860
Oh wait.

692
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,620
Hold on, don't look.

693
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,420
Machine prize number.

694
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,080
Wait, which one was this?

695
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,740
Wait, how do I know which machine this was?

696
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,640
You guys, it's my business email.

697
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,380
Chill out.

698
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,720
That email is literally on my Twitter.

699
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,600
Don't worry.

700
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,960
Literally, that email is on my Twitter.

701
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,700
Anybody has that email?

702
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,980
Wait, how do I know which one it is though?

703
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,620
It's saying it's in the cart.

704
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,860
Oh it is in my cart!

705
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,300
Oh my gosh!

706
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,920
You guys!

707
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,160
Oh my gosh!

708
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,620
Tumbler!

709
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,140
Tumbler A in the cart!

710
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,640
Oh my gosh!

711
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,020
Yippee!

712
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,340
Alright.

713
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,180
It took me way less tries than that first guy too, so...

714
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,100
To you, mister whoever it was.

715
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,840
Alright, hold on.

716
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,180
Let's go back to...

717
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,680
Let's go back to...

718
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,980
Now we can go to Metal Gear Solid.

719
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,400
It's beneficial to ship them all at once.

720
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,400
Yeah, I'm just going to keep it in my cart.

721
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,620
Can I go back please?

722
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,260
There we go.

723
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,160
I'm just going to keep it in my cart.

724
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,220
And then...Yay!

725
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,060
Oh my gosh!

726
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,540
Wait, it's on the front page!

727
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,420
It wasn't before!

728
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,040
Is it because we made it so popular?

729
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,720
Why is it 1500 TP now?

730
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,720
Excuse me?

731
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:31,720
Inflation?

732
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:32,520
Wait!

733
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,220
What is this?

734
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,460
Oh, this is like a real crane game.

735
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,720
This is like a real crane game.

736
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,160
But we already did a Metal Gear Solid.

737
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,580
We want Metal Gear.

738
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,560
We want Metal Gear Solid.

739
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,880
Wait, can I choose if I win?

740
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,540
I like how the browsing just goes up every time.

741
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,460
You guys are so silly.

742
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,340
It's based on the one for the display.

743
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,080
Oh, so A.

744
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,820
Can I ask them to change it?

745
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,760
Excuse me!

746
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:20,920
Excuse me!

747
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:21,960
Excuse me!

748
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,420
Excuse me staff!

749
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,640
Sadly no.

750
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:31,900
It's ok.

751
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,700
We'll just go back to...

752
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,620
We'll just go back to the...

753
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,740
The search?

754
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,740
Wow, I didn't think it would be on the front page.

755
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,680
That's so exciting.

756
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:49,120
Now everybody will see the Metal Gear Tumb...Oh no, now everybody will see the Metal Gear Tumblers.

757
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:49,980
Oh no!

758
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,820
Wait, is it because I made it popular that they put it in the thing?

759
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,800
Is it because they were like, oh, lots of people are going for these Metal Gears?

760
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,200
Probably!

761
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
Oh, Trendsetter!

762
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,340
Holy moly!

763
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,440
Guys, look at our influence.

764
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,400
We put Metal Gear on the front page.

765
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,460
Good job everybody!

766
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,680
You did it boss?

767
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,820
No, we did it!

768
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,660
All of my... All of my successes are our successes.

769
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:43,210
That's why I say, like, whenever I beat a boss, I'm like, we did it!

770
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:44,590
Because we all did it together.

771
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:47,610
Yeah.

772
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,490
And all of your failures are our failures.

773
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:50,890
Yeah!

774
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,830
We are all one.

775
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,050
We are the hive mind.

776
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:58,310
Yeah.

777
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:09,150
When something... When, you know, when something bad happens, or rather, you know, maybe something weird happens, it's all of us.

778
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,540
One for all and all for one!

779
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,040
Do we also have to take the blame for the slide puzzles?

780
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,380
What's wrong with the slide puzzles?

781
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,080
Alright, so Metal Gear Solid.

782
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,700
That's B.

783
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,300
Restock it?

784
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:41,880
Wow!

785
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,160
Wait, so what is this one then?

786
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,720
It's always been currently in use.

787
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,480
What are these?

788
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,840
There's so many of them.

789
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,420
Select the machine you wish to play.

790
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,360
Wait, what are these?

791
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,910
This one looks not so bad.

792
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:12,750
It's just like a little tag, right?

793
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,210
These are general machines for general prizes, but you pick the prize.

794
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:23,910
Wait, so I can... But I've picked it, so I can just do what I... Oh my gosh, there's only four remaining.

795
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,730
I'm so scared.

796
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,210
Get some of that Metal Gear freaky made.

797
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:33,170
Oh, thank you!

798
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:38,830
Which one is the easiest, you would say?

799
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:44,110
Which one is the easiest, I wonder.

800
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:51,350
Soccer!

801
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,250
Are you winning me?

802
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,390
I am, actually!

803
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,970
This is truly our Metal Gear.

804
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,990
Not the 1000TP.

805
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,770
50,000 TP!

806
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,880
Why is it so expensive?

807
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,400
What?

808
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:22,440
This one is like a... Hold on.

809
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,940
Where you knock it off, the thing, right?

810
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,920
This one doesn't look so bad.

811
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,780
It's 2,000.

812
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,580
I think it's okay.

813
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,310
Takoyaki and some of the tool arm cranes.

814
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,130
It's grindy, this one.

815
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,330
Cheapest, the harder to win.

816
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:58,950
Yeah, yeah.

817
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,550
You think it'll move at all, I wonder.

818
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,310
My depth perception isn't very good with these games.

819
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:18,830
Takoyaki wasn't for me.

820
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:20,990
Wasn't there a takoyaki for this?

821
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:21,730
Oh my god.

822
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:26,910
Sir Takoyaki.

823
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:29,170
Takoyaki was so expensive, though.

824
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:32,650
Takoyaki is very, very pricey.

825
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:34,990
I wish there was like a...

826
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,670
Well, I guess 2,000 is the in-between.

827
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:38,550
What about this one?

828
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:43,490
Oh, did she win anything yet?

829
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:45,150
Maybe let me write a thing on the bottom.

830
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,030
Let me say... Hold on.

831
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,450
ViviCorn, thanks for the five gifted!

832
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:57,330
Number of tumblers, one.

833
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,210
One out of four.

834
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,390
There we go.

835
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,620
So what do you do with this?

836
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:23,480
Wait, first you have to scoop the ball and then you have to let it drop?

837
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,960
First you have to scoop the ball?

838
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,680
You have to be able to scoop it?

839
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:41,070
And hope it gets into the get zone, yeah.

840
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:46,330
Someone browsing, try this for me please.

841
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:51,810
Someone try... Someone looking at this, please.

842
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:55,950
I want to watch... I want to sample it first, please.

843
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:57,330
Go, go!

844
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:01,120
Go, go!

845
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,620
There's four people browsing.

846
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,260
Oh my gosh!

847
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,940
You guys are so...

848
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,040
You gotta scoop.

849
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,480
Scoop it.

850
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,820
Oh, you're so close.

851
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,180
Oh my gosh!

852
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,940
Oh my gosh, if you win this...

853
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,380
If you win this, you have to... You will be the luckiest person ever.

854
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,260
Oh my gosh!

855
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,200
Oh my gosh!

856
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,560
Wait!

857
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:22,780
Oh my gosh!

858
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,360
Oh my gosh!

859
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,000
Oh my gosh!

860
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,000
That was naughty.

861
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,940
That went completely a different direction.

862
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,960
Okay, I'm so sorry you tried that one.

863
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,580
The ball is drunk.

864
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,080
That one was really bad.

865
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,300
Oh, you're gonna try again?

866
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,400
Okay, I'm rooting for you.

867
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,100
That one was so...

868
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,080
Oh my gosh, it was so naughty.

869
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,940
It just went completely a different...

870
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,400
It was like, I'm making it.

871
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,240
I'm gonna make it.

872
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,380
Nevermind.

873
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:07,600
Again!

874
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,680
And you can't determine where it goes in the middle, huh?

875
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,640
Oh, these balls are weighted.

876
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,420
Look at that!

877
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,920
Do you see how weighted that ball is?

878
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,540
Oh my gosh.

879
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,160
KZ Raptor, thank you for the five gifted.

880
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,000
Wait, you're gonna try again?

881
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:22,420
Seriously?

882
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,920
How do you even assist in this one?

883
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,980
Same direction too.

884
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:31,420
Yeah.

885
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,080
It's so weighted.

886
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,000
It's personal now.

887
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,720
I believe in you!

888
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,000
The house always wins, everybody.

889
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,560
The house always wins.

890
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,520
Yo, that's so messed up.

891
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,480
That one... Okay, you guys...

892
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,760
Stop trying!

893
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:05,780
It's impossible!

894
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,740
I don't think anybody has ever won this ever.

895
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,560
How are you supposed to even?

896
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,620
I know I'm not in the queue, I'm just watching.

897
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,760
Oh, watch from the side.

898
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,450
Look, they decorated it so cute.

899
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,770
So you just think it's nice and harmless.

900
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:49,310
I don't think you can choose to put it anywhere else than down the middle.

901
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,090
I think it automatically does it for you.

902
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:54,370
These are the only two times you get to manually...

903
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:58,810
Oh god, it hurts!

904
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,060
It hurts!

905
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,880
Thank you for the super chat.

906
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,020
I hope you're having a good day too.

907
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,920
Oh my goodness, I can't watch this one anymore.

908
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,460
It hurts.

909
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:18,800
It's too painful.

910
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,580
There's still four remaining.

911
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:32,390
For things like this, it's like you push it through, right?

912
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:38,910
For ones like this, you have to kind of shove it through the...

913
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,110
The thing, right?

914
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:41,630
You have to kind of push it.

915
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,780
At some point, yes.

916
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,600
Gotta give it a good poke.

917
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:05,380
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

918
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,140
You tilt it until it's a good position, then you push.

919
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,340
Look, it looks really wide around here.

920
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,080
What is this one?

921
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,940
Oh, this one you just lift up and...

922
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,940
This one's like legitimate crane game.

923
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,480
Where you just get it into the hole, isn't it?

924
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,340
Oh, my depth perception?

925
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,200
I thought it was right on top of it.

926
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,520
Oh, my gosh.

927
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,740
Legit, sure.

928
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,020
What's J-Claw?

929
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,360
What is a J-Claw?

930
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,080
Let's give it a try.

931
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,260
OK, I'm gonna try it.

932
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:04,820
Start!

933
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,140
Oh, OK.

934
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,640
One little poke.

935
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,700
And then, yeah.

936
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:14,840
Oh no!

937
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,220
I tried to account for the leg.

938
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,660
I tried to account for the leg.

939
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,620
And I didn't do enough.

940
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:24,620
OK, hold on.

941
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,040
Let's redo, redo, redo.

942
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,320
Redo, redo.

943
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:39,710
Alright.

944
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:39,790
Alright.

945
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:47,080
Let's see if I push it at all.

946
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,660
A smidge.

947
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,760
A tiny little bit.

948
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,100
Tiny, tiny bit.

949
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,220
This is tough.

950
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:14,930
OK, I'm gonna try and get it to like...

951
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:18,070
There.

952
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,090
Let's see if I can get the ear, you know?

953
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:30,250
Yeah, it's a grindy one, huh?

954
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:33,310
Uh...

955
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:39,170
Did I even...I'm not even moving at all.

956
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:43,430
OK, hold on.

957
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,000
Smidge!

958
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,300
Tiny, tiny!

959
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,840
And then...

960
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,640
Do the...Oh!

961
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,540
Oh no, I think that might be OK.

962
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,880
Did I move it any closer?

963
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,740
Do you think I moved it any closer?

964
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,500
Still forward progress.

965
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,380
It's moving tiny.

966
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:31,450
Was that too much?

967
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:31,850
I wonder.

968
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,700
You guys!

969
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,000
That was a big hop!

970
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,500
That was a big hop!

971
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,460
That was a big hop!

972
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,700
Oh my gosh!

973
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,920
A little, little, little, little...OK.

974
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,470
Oh, maybe that was not enough.

975
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:00,330
Shoot.

976
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,040
I don't think it was enough.

977
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:13,660
No.

978
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:13,980
No.

979
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,580
I think they won.

980
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,300
The ball won.

981
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,500
No way!

982
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,240
I went and checked and it's in the basket.

983
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:26,160
No way!

984
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,500
No way.

985
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,500
Oh gosh, I'm gonna have to...Oh gosh.

986
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:31,900
I'm gonna have to get more TP.

987
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,460
I'm gonna have to get more TP.

988
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,780
More toilet paper, please!

989
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:56,950
Wait, I just realized, getting over this part, it's probably sticky.

990
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:01,010
I think this part is probably sticky, huh?

991
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:02,750
Oh no.

992
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:09,110
I just noticed.

993
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:11,410
OK.

994
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:32,330
I'm like literally just...

995
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:37,290
Oh my god, I've scooched it over just a tiny, tiny bit.

996
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:41,850
I feel like someone else is gonna grab it though and there's only four left.

997
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:45,090
I'm gonna lose out.

998
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:47,030
No!

999
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:52,670
For this one, I make the first press longer so the claw has to push the back over more.

1000
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:56,410
I think I get it.

1001
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,880
You can keep your spot in queue?

1002
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,440
Wait, how do I do that?

1003
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,580
Purchase a TP.

1004
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,680
Is that keeping my...Oh, it kept my spot!

1005
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,360
It really did.

1006
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,900
It gave me lots more time.

1007
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:19,740
OK.

1008
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,300
I'll do...

1009
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,880
So I initially spent $60.

1010
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,780
That's how much I initially got.

1011
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,220
So I'll get like the $35 one.

1012
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,390
Oh good, I saved my credit card.

1013
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:52,910
Oh good, it saved my credit card.

1014
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,490
Alright.

1015
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:00,210
Transaction complete.

1016
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:02,130
Thank you.

1017
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,430
Thank you.

1018
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,840
Alrighty.

1019
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,900
Thank you for the $80!

1020
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,320
Stop it, don't...

1021
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,300
Don't...Don't...Don't...Don't...

1022
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,640
Wait, what's the word?

1023
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,020
Don't reward my gambling!

1024
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,280
I really like the new model and the eyepatch.

1025
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,220
But I love the classic Minto gear solid headband remains.

1026
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:30,880
Of course!

1027
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:32,900
OK.

1028
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,420
Sorry for those waiting, sorry.

1029
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,300
Oh TP, but thank you!

1030
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,440
Iris, welcome to membership.

1031
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,160
Thank you.

1032
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,040
Enable, yeah that's the word.

1033
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,480
Fuel, fuel, yeah.

1034
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:49,640
Alright, start.

1035
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:54,400
Alright, maybe like that much.

1036
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,390
Oh that was a good shove!

1037
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:06,250
Nice!

1038
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:07,830
Toilet paper fight.

1039
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:09,290
No good!

1040
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:12,900
Thank you!

1041
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:19,160
I honestly considered turning off super chats for this stream because I was like...

1042
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:24,160
I don't want people to feel like they must...

1043
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,660
Uh oh, was that too much?

1044
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,260
Was that too much I think?

1045
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:38,320
Shove!

1046
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,800
Shove, shove, shove, shove, shove!

1047
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:43,880
Yes!

1048
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,020
Oh my gosh, we're inching it, we're inching it, we're inching it.

1049
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,860
I'm scared now.

1050
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:04,360
Because I don't know how much I need to go over now.

1051
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,980
Guys that was so good!

1052
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,780
Oh my gosh you guys, that was so good, that was so good!

1053
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,480
That was huge!

1054
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:21,200
We reached leaps and bounds!

1055
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:22,100
OK.

1056
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:23,980
Start.

1057
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:24,060
Start.

1058
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,790
Oh, that one was not so good.

1059
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,350
That one was not so good.

1060
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:47,270
OK, we need to redo that one.

1061
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,440
Oh no, I don't think I went enough.

1062
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,720
This side is tricky for me.

1063
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,080
This side is tricky.

1064
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:08,260
Nothing.

1065
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,800
Actually I feel like...

1066
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,920
Good luck, thank you!

1067
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:17,900
Thank you Mew!

1068
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,940
His ear, he's like a weird shape, right?

1069
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,800
He's like kind of like a...

1070
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,080
Hey!

1071
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:28,680
Hey!

1072
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,240
Oh, I thought that was a sticker.

1073
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,820
I thought someone sent a sticker of them falling asleep.

1074
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,340
I was like, stop BMing me!

1075
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:45,590
Like, snore, hurry up!

1076
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:48,170
Oh my gosh.

1077
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:50,030
Actually, OK.

1078
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:56,670
This might not have been the move, but I'm gonna try it anyway.

1079
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:00,050
Oh, I'm such an idiot!

1080
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:04,930
I'm an idiot, I'm an idiot.

1081
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:06,370
OK, I'm an idiot.

1082
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:07,850
I went the wrong way.

1083
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:09,690
BM stands for badminton.

1084
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:13,450
I went backwards a little bit.

1085
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,940
I think I went over too far!

1086
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,660
This other side is so tricky.

1087
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:34,040
This side is so tricky!

1088
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,780
Stop it!

1089
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:54,470
I went over too far again.

1090
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:05,450
I think I'm gonna try and go to the cat's eye.

1091
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:07,590
That's tough.

1092
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:09,330
Keep going on the side closer to the claw.

1093
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:15,840
Thank

1094
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:24,100
you for the super chat!

1095
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:24,760
Toilet paper.

1096
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:34,970
Is she playing a generic game to win the specific MGS prizes?

1097
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,210
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1098
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:37,250
Yes, yes, yes.

1099
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:39,470
Thank you for everybody.

1100
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:42,110
Stop!

1101
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:44,050
Why?

1102
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:45,570
Don't send that!

1103
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:46,610
Oh my gosh.

1104
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,330
Thank you for the super, but no!

1105
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:49,910
Please, toilet.

1106
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:52,090
Thank you, but no!

1107
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,000
I think I went too far over.

1108
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:20,190
Why does this ghost use so much TP?

1109
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:25,710
This is hard.

1110
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:26,730
This one is difficult.

1111
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:03,200
Guys, I don't know where to go from here.

1112
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,340
I wonder if it's the bar stopping it.

1113
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,680
OK, I'm gonna just keep to the left again.

1114
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,420
To the left side of it.

1115
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,720
Did I go over too far?

1116
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,660
You guys, it's not moving anymore at all.

1117
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,860
It's not moving anymore at all.

1118
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:33,840
Oh no!

1119
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:36,240
I got so far.

1120
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,300
I think it's stuck.

1121
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,240
Sticky surface.

1122
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,040
Go near the ear, but which one?

1123
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,460
Use the ears, but which one?

1124
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,220
The

1125
01:11:58,820 --> 01:11:59,880
left ear?

1126
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,240
One closer to the edge.

1127
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:13,740
OK.

1128
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:31,590
The lag.

1129
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:36,670
Oh

1130
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:40,910
my gosh!

1131
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:44,710
Wait, we are so close!

1132
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:45,450
We are so close!

1133
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:46,190
We are so close!

1134
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:48,430
We are so close!

1135
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:52,630
I pitted on Albedo swimsuit.

1136
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:55,810
Oh my gosh.

1137
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:57,970
Which way should I go now?

1138
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:58,910
To the ear again?

1139
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:01,330
How do I even go to the ear again though?

1140
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:05,790
Maybe I can...

1141
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:07,870
It's so...

1142
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:09,430
It's so...

1143
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:11,190
Hold on.

1144
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:14,380
It's so goofy looking.

1145
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,740
I don't think I went far enough over.

1146
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:40,630
Maybe I should keep pushing the...

1147
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:42,950
Why are there so many people waiting going up?

1148
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:46,230
Maybe the same ear.

1149
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:49,010
Maybe I can push it over a little bit more.

1150
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,330
OK, where is the ear?

1151
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,530
It's like right there.

1152
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:54,710
OK, I'll try.

1153
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:00,050
Maybe like there.

1154
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:03,330
It feels really far over.

1155
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:14,180
I need to go over just a tiny bit more.

1156
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:16,700
To get inside, I think.

1157
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:26,550
Maybe too far over.

1158
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:33,870
What?

1159
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:44,630
Oh my goodness.

1160
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:47,750
I don't know guys.

1161
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:49,210
I don't know if I can...

1162
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:53,170
I don't know if I can go with that spot anymore.

1163
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,530
It keeps rotating.

1164
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:59,870
I don't know if I can go with that.

1165
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:03,450
I think I need to maybe aim for like over right in here.

1166
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:05,110
That's the goal.

1167
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:05,570
OK,

1168
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:17,470
maybe it's OK.

1169
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:19,310
Oh no, it's not OK.

1170
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:21,790
OK, I need to not...

1171
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:25,110
OK, I need to more...

1172
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:29,050
I don't think this one has assists.

1173
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:30,910
I don't know actually.

1174
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,410
Uh oh, I'm almost out of money again.

1175
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:37,910
Wait, I've almost spent 30 bucks on this and nothing...

1176
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:43,890
This sucks!

1177
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,330
Maybe like the eye.

1178
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:51,670
But I'll have interference with the ear.

1179
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:53,670
I think.

1180
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,710
Oh my gosh, my depth perception sucks.

1181
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:56,570
Hey!

1182
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:57,850
Chill out!

1183
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,020
I don't think I can push it down yet.

1184
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,740
I don't think I... Do you think it'll fall if I push it?

1185
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:11,860
I don't think so though.

1186
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,940
I don't think I can push it just yet.

1187
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:20,960
Yeah, not yet.

1188
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:28,330
Oh shoot.

1189
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:29,970
Oh my gosh.

1190
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:30,390
Wait.

1191
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:31,430
Shoot.

1192
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:33,490
That's not where... Oh my god.

1193
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,690
The camera angle threw me all off.

1194
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:44,270
How am I supposed to grab it from here?

1195
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,350
Guys, I'm not sure.

1196
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:02,060
Like I don't know where to grab it from here, because I can't.

1197
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,480
My depth perception sucks.

1198
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:04,780
Shut up!

1199
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,520
Oh my gosh, thank you for the Akasuba!

1200
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,120
My wallet is now your property.

1201
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:22,740
Other cheek.

1202
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,720
Ok, other cheek.

1203
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,980
Please stop spamming!

1204
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,500
I know you're trying to help, but I don't think you can push it down yet.

1205
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,900
I'm not going to push it yet.

1206
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:56,920
Thank you.

1207
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,040
Please stop spamming.

1208
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,500
I'm gonna have to time you out if you keep spamming.

1209
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:11,630
Oh god.

1210
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:31,630
Maybe?

1211
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:33,430
Oh!

1212
01:18:33,690 --> 01:18:35,230
The tiniest little push!

1213
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:39,470
The tiniest little push!

1214
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:42,930
The tiny, tiny, tiny bit.

1215
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:47,990
How is their crane game backseating?

1216
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,330
You'd be so surprised.

1217
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:52,670
Baby push.

1218
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,980
I think I went too far over.

1219
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:11,340
Maybe.

1220
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:21,550
Too shy to ask, but it was my birthday a few days ago.

1221
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:22,570
Is it ok if I have a birthday song?

1222
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:23,510
Wow!

1223
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:24,350
Jimmy!

1224
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:25,090
Neutron!

1225
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:27,090
I have to be fast though.

1226
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:30,030
Happy birthday to you!

1227
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:32,290
Happy birthday to you!

1228
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:35,310
Happy birthday, Jimmy Neutron!

1229
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:39,850
Happy birthday to you!

1230
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:41,890
Happy birthday!

1231
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:44,650
Don't ever feel too shy.

1232
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:45,890
What are you talking about?

1233
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:47,250
Don't ever.

1234
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:51,470
I want to get right in here.

1235
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:56,490
But I don't... I can't tell where the ear ends.

1236
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:57,150
It's too...

1237
01:19:57,150 --> 01:19:58,850
It's too tricky for me.

1238
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:01,810
To tell, you know?

1239
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:07,780
It's too tricky for me to tell.

1240
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:11,760
It's

1241
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:35,760
so tricky!

1242
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:39,840
Maybe I should just try pushing it.

1243
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,780
But the left side is so weak.

1244
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,960
Maybe I should try just pushing it though.

1245
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:54,020
Oh my gosh!

1246
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:58,360
You're right!

1247
01:20:58,460 --> 01:20:58,900
I'm out of TP!

1248
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,220
Thank you for letting me know.

1249
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:03,580
I buy more.

1250
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:11,340
Purchase TP.

1251
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,380
Oh my god, this is so sad.

1252
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:16,400
Alexa.

1253
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:16,560
Alexa.

1254
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:18,980
Play.

1255
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:23,960
Snake Eater.

1256
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,940
Okay, I went through.

1257
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,260
Please recognize that I went through.

1258
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:34,820
Oh, there it is.

1259
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:34,980
Okay.

1260
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:41,510
How am I supposed to do this?

1261
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:47,610
Oh my god, Miyu, stop, please!

1262
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,250
Oh my gosh, thank you, but stop, please!

1263
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:51,770
I really appreciate it, but stop!

1264
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:54,410
Thank you, thank you.

1265
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:58,490
Come on, hot dog.

1266
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:07,320
First... Oh, timing try.

1267
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:08,760
Okay, I'll try it.

1268
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,900
1, 2... 1, stop.

1269
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:15,420
Then second screen... Or say 0, 1, stop.

1270
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,980
Then second screen 0, 1, 2, stop.

1271
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:19,660
Wait, how fast do I do that?

1272
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,160
0, 1, 2?

1273
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,080
Or 0, 1, 2.

1274
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,060
How fast do I do that?

1275
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:29,870
How do I get it in two shots?

1276
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:46,910
You guys, the Bolly roll one... My friend won that one.

1277
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:49,030
How the hell did you do that?

1278
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:53,980
What?

1279
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:56,460
How?

1280
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,000
I told you my friend is really good at crane games.

1281
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:07,390
Oh my gosh.

1282
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:08,190
Okay, I'm gonna...

1283
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:10,490
Okay, so this ear...

1284
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:11,790
And then stab it down.

1285
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:12,950
Maybe?

1286
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:17,850
I said hot dog, gotcha and gotchu.

1287
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:20,150
So if I say chugacha I get hot dog?

1288
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:21,210
Oh my gosh, I actually did.

1289
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:21,750
That's crazy.

1290
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,210
Okay, alright.

1291
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:25,190
The ear here...

1292
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,540
Did I go too far over?

1293
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:41,730
I got it though.

1294
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:43,110
I got it over a little more.

1295
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,880
Do you think I can stab it?

1296
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,040
Do you think I can stab it?

1297
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,180
Do you think I can stab it?

1298
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:58,210
Or are we still...

1299
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:00,090
Not yet?

1300
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:01,230
Okay, not yet, not yet.

1301
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:03,410
Not yet, not yet.

1302
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:03,670
Okay.

1303
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:08,410
I need to get the other side though.

1304
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:12,410
You need to get the other side though.

1305
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:13,570
Oh gosh.

1306
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:24,720
Oopsie.

1307
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,220
Uh oh.

1308
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:33,390
Do you think the ear is a good place to keep pushing?

1309
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:34,450
Maybe, okay.

1310
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:37,810
This is stressing me out.

1311
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:39,310
I'm so sweaty.

1312
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:41,610
I'm so sweaty.

1313
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:48,930
I know, this stupid piece of hair right there keeps getting in the way.

1314
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:50,410
It's driving me crazy.

1315
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:53,050
I think I'm too far over.

1316
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,460
I guess I just lobotomized him instead.

1317
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,940
I just lobotomized him.

1318
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,840
Do you spend this much on actual crane games in Japan?

1319
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,000
No, I never play crane games ever.

1320
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:34,880
So I'm just making up for it, you know.

1321
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,180
Ahem.

1322
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:42,920
I don't think this one has the assist.

1323
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,720
Otherwise I feel like people would come in already.

1324
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:53,740
Alrighty.

1325
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:58,720
Yeah, he's got a little dent now in his brain.

1326
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,260
Good.

1327
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:00,840
He deserves it.

1328
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,920
This hair, his hair is so annoying.

1329
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,740
I need to go over just a tiny bit more.

1330
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,280
I need to go over a tiny bit more.

1331
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,440
Like there maybe.

1332
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:40,070
I know the lag is...

1333
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:46,690
Okay, I need to go over more, even more.

1334
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,060
They

1335
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,680
helped me out!

1336
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:14,280
Yippee!

1337
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:15,360
We got the assist!

1338
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,420
So now I can just push it down, right?

1339
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,960
Pity has been taken on us.

1340
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:27,340
Thank you God!

1341
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,820
Thank you!

1342
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:33,420
Okay.

1343
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,940
How do I do this though?

1344
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,020
Don't push it back.

1345
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:45,700
Do you think they'd help me again?

1346
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:54,090
I'm going over!

1347
01:27:56,930 --> 01:27:57,870
I'm scared!

1348
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:11,850
Yeah!

1349
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:15,210
Let's go!

1350
01:28:20,370 --> 01:28:21,610
Yippee!

1351
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:25,810
Oh my gosh!

1352
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:27,690
We did it!

1353
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:32,430
Yippee!

1354
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:39,590
Everybody waiting left.

1355
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:45,700
Two out of four!

1356
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,160
Oh my gosh!

1357
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,540
Oh my gosh!

1358
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:53,480
Is it in my cart?

1359
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,420
Hold on, let me check.

1360
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,580
First try!

1361
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:05,660
Oh there it is!

1362
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:20,010
Oh my gosh!

1363
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:21,470
It feels so good!

1364
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:25,650
I feel so good!

1365
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,650
Oh, it is still there.

1366
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:29,890
I was going to say they took it off.

1367
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:31,330
Is anybody doing it?

1368
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:32,790
Wait, what was that?

1369
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:36,450
Oh, they changed it to D!

1370
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:38,990
You think?

1371
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:45,650
They changed it, but I don't want to go out of order.

1372
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:50,710
I'm on C!

1373
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:01,630
This one is really hard.

1374
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:14,130
This is hard.

1375
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:17,270
These are not that easy.

1376
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:19,070
This machine is also grindy!

1377
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:25,530
Hold on, there was something on the page that I wanted.

1378
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:26,510
This!

1379
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:26,810
Look!

1380
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:28,490
Oh, I thought it was a ghost.

1381
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:30,790
I thought this was a ghost.

1382
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:31,910
Oh, it's gone now.

1383
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:32,430
Nevermind.

1384
01:30:33,550 --> 01:30:34,970
Oh, they took it off!

1385
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:37,090
They were like, oh, she wanted...

1386
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:38,110
Oh, nevermind, it's right here.

1387
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:40,050
My head is blocking it.

1388
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:42,290
They were like, oh, she wanted D.

1389
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:43,390
We have to change it.

1390
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:47,070
Let's go back to the Metal Gears.

1391
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,440
I'm actually good at those machines.

1392
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,800
I feel like those are the easiest.

1393
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,280
But my friends do have a hard time.

1394
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,440
You guys, do we go back?

1395
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:03,580
For C.

1396
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:04,980
Limited stock!

1397
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,420
Wait, they're all limited stock!

1398
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:07,400
Wait a second!

1399
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:09,180
Wait a second, please!

1400
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:11,160
You guys, I have to get them first!

1401
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,460
When did they all turn to limited stock?

1402
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:15,820
What?

1403
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:18,720
Every single one of them is on limited stock now!

1404
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,680
Do we do this one with my last 4,000?

1405
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:23,760
How long have I been streaming?

1406
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:25,060
Only an hour and a half.

1407
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:31,320
Oh my gosh!

1408
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,440
Apparently everybody wants them now.

1409
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,160
Everybody is into Metal Gear Solid now.

1410
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:50,600
I was addicted to using free tries on this in like... They had free tries?

1411
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:53,600
I probably spent less than 100 bucks and won somewhere...

1412
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:54,800
Wow!

1413
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:55,220
What?

1414
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:55,920
That's crazy!

1415
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,400
12 or 13 figures!

1416
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:59,280
Oh my gosh, really?

1417
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:10,760
I don't know.

1418
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,020
What about some of the other ones?

1419
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,380
I hope they have Ace Combat.

1420
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:18,180
If there is Ace Combat in the co-op games, maybe.

1421
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:21,240
I can't believe we got A and B.

1422
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,260
I'm so happy.

1423
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:33,500
There's free TP offers on the front page.

1424
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,300
Oh, I see.

1425
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:50,620
This one is only 500.

1426
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:53,360
Wait, what does this look like?

1427
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:54,840
It's only 500 TP.

1428
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,020
And it's Takoyaki.

1429
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:58,740
Oh!

1430
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,640
You have to scoop and then...

1431
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:12,380
Oh, I'm on Tumblr, right?

1432
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:13,560
It's ok, I wasn't gonna try.

1433
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:19,140
And it bounces on the yellow.

1434
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:22,980
Scary.

1435
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:26,640
Scary.

1436
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:33,590
Scary.

1437
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:35,810
It's only 500.

1438
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:37,190
Should we give it a shot?

1439
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:41,270
The Takoyaki pan is cursed.

1440
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:45,750
I feel like I spent less... Ok.

1441
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:47,910
Actually, I have no idea.

1442
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:50,430
I wonder if I spent more on the Takoyaki pan...

1443
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:51,830
Like, collectively.

1444
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:56,170
Or if I spent more on... I feel like I spent more on that last crane game.

1445
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:58,390
I wonder.

1446
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:02,050
Don't worry guys, I was gonna go to C.

1447
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:03,690
Don't worry, I just wanted to look at it.

1448
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:11,330
2.5 times on the crane?

1449
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:17,370
But, it felt more traditional crane game style.

1450
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:18,090
You know?

1451
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:19,930
I felt like I was truly at the arcade.

1452
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:21,030
Actually, hold on.

1453
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:24,070
I should put on arcade ambiance instead, shouldn't I?

1454
01:34:24,330 --> 01:34:24,830
Hold on.

1455
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:27,210
I'm gonna put on an arcade...

1456
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:29,390
I wonder if there's a good one.

1457
01:34:30,450 --> 01:34:31,630
Arcade ambiance.

1458
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:34,350
Japanese...

1459
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:35,830
It's gonna be like really loud though.

1460
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:38,510
Ambiance.

1461
01:34:43,890 --> 01:34:45,090
Ambient sounds...

1462
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:49,210
Oh, I hear... Hey Akihabara, thousands of game arcades, virtual tour...

1463
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:49,350
Oh!

1464
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,030
Arcade ASMR 4K for 10 hours.

1465
01:34:53,150 --> 01:34:54,650
Hold on, let me hear it first.

1466
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:56,490
Are

1467
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,260
you guys immersed?

1468
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,320
We're so immersed right now.

1469
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:21,720
Oh my gosh, an actual takoyaki.

1470
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:25,940
I wonder.

1471
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,200
What did I say?

1472
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:34,800
This isn't a Japanese arcade though.

1473
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,960
This is like a real arcade.

1474
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:40,020
Hold on, let me go to Japanese arcade.

1475
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:40,540
Hold on.

1476
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:43,840
This one is from 8 years ago.

1477
01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:48,650
Can I loop it?

1478
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:48,850
OK.

1479
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:54,780
There we go.

1480
01:36:02,230 --> 01:36:06,230
One of the comments on this video is, there are too many cars.

1481
01:36:06,690 --> 01:36:06,690
Sad.

1482
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:10,950
Oh, I hear all the cars.

1483
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:12,650
Maybe the last one was better.

1484
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:14,150
Let's do the last one.

1485
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:16,510
Where did... Oh, here we go.

1486
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:28,930
There are too many cars.

1487
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:29,270
Sad.

1488
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:32,830
Alright guys.

1489
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:33,590
This one is...

1490
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:40,100
This one is a true claw game too.

1491
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:41,900
Oh, let's see.

1492
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:42,620
This one is in use.

1493
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:43,320
Let's see how they are doing.

1494
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:50,960
Oh, it's a little... You can do it!

1495
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,460
Four people are waiting on this one.

1496
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,620
Nine people browsing.

1497
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:58,180
Why are there so many people here?

1498
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,620
Oh, it's a sponge.

1499
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,740
Oh my... What?

1500
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:17,910
Is this another streamer?

1501
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:21,170
Oh my gosh, is there another streamer doing this who likes Metal Gear?

1502
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:42,140
Limit!

1503
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:44,340
Thank you so much for the superchat.

1504
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:45,260
Thank you!

1505
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:48,400
Who is your profile picture?

1506
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:49,200
It's so cute.

1507
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:55,320
What is that?

1508
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,280
Made lilac?

1509
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,160
Himeno... Oh!

1510
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:07,280
Yes!

1511
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:11,020
I've seen... I've seen Twinpail before.

1512
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,500
I saw them at Heroines.

1513
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:13,340
Yes!

1514
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,520
They are so cute!

1515
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:18,500
The other member with the two-tone hair is so cute.

1516
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:20,000
They are both cute.

1517
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:20,720
They are both very cute.

1518
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:28,070
Oh, I think they messed up you guys.

1519
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:30,070
We are giving them like...

1520
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:34,830
They are getting some real performance anxiety here.

1521
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:37,510
How do you do this?

1522
01:38:42,820 --> 01:38:44,340
You can hear Tetris?

1523
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:52,320
I guess you just pick up the sponge, right?

1524
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:54,780
I'm confused by this one.

1525
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:00,580
Do you get it on the sides or do you get it into this hole?

1526
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,780
Like what's the goal here?

1527
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:09,080
Oh my god.

1528
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:10,560
I think it's the sides.

1529
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:11,680
Oh they can just push it then!

1530
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:12,220
Oh my gosh!

1531
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:12,860
Push it!

1532
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:13,180
Push it!

1533
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:13,620
Push it!

1534
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:15,500
Push!

1535
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:15,940
Push!

1536
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:25,910
Push!

1537
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:26,350
Push!

1538
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:27,390
Push!

1539
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:27,950
Push!

1540
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:28,330
Push!

1541
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:28,410
Push!

1542
01:39:28,430 --> 01:39:28,610
Push!

1543
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:32,090
Oh, Minto is backseating.

1544
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:38,290
I'm not backseating.

1545
01:39:38,290 --> 01:39:39,330
I'm encouraging.

1546
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:42,330
It's probably what some of you guys think too, huh?

1547
01:39:42,630 --> 01:39:44,210
I'm not backseating the streamer.

1548
01:39:44,530 --> 01:39:46,330
I'm giving encouraging words of advice.

1549
01:39:48,330 --> 01:39:48,790
Push!

1550
01:39:48,910 --> 01:39:49,250
Push!

1551
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:51,930
Did they stop?

1552
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:53,010
Oh, maybe they are getting more money.

1553
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:59,890
Imagine if you were getting more money and it just like slid.

1554
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:03,050
It just was like...

1555
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:08,010
And you go back to the machine and you are just like...

1556
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:09,630
OK.

1557
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:12,010
Alright guys, we got to figure out...

1558
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:15,670
This one I thought was a wisp for a second.

1559
01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:18,990
I thought this one was a wisp for a second.

1560
01:40:19,450 --> 01:40:20,330
Is this one easy?

1561
01:40:21,070 --> 01:40:21,990
What is this one like?

1562
01:40:27,050 --> 01:40:28,530
This one... How?

1563
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:29,750
How does this work?

1564
01:40:37,570 --> 01:40:38,550
You just pick it up?

1565
01:40:41,690 --> 01:40:43,490
You just pick it up and...

1566
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:46,610
The claws must be so weak though, right?

1567
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:51,990
I just finished making a fresh baked potato.

1568
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:53,270
Yummy!

1569
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:53,510
Yummy!

1570
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:58,110
Crow, have a delicious potato night.

1571
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:07,260
OK, I'm going back to the...

1572
01:41:08,450 --> 01:41:10,050
I'm going back to this one.

1573
01:41:11,610 --> 01:41:13,690
Oh my gosh, limited stock!

1574
01:41:18,410 --> 01:41:20,330
We are going back to the Takoyaki.

1575
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:24,890
Takoyaki time!

1576
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:27,210
What the...

1577
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:28,870
Oops, wrong one.

1578
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:29,370
Just kidding.

1579
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:32,590
What's really missing are those singing big clapper...

1580
01:41:35,050 --> 01:41:36,970
Wait, where is the Takoyaki time?

1581
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:39,650
Tako... Oh, up here.

1582
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:43,290
Takoyaki time!

1583
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:44,410
Takoyaki time!

1584
01:41:46,790 --> 01:41:47,910
Takoyaki time!

1585
01:41:48,090 --> 01:41:48,950
Let's play baby!

1586
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:49,070
Let's play!

1587
01:41:56,470 --> 01:41:59,430
Grab the ball and see where it falls.

1588
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:02,370
Oh my gosh, my...

1589
01:42:04,090 --> 01:42:05,910
His grandpa used to have one.

1590
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,460
How did that happen?

1591
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:40,440
Seriously?

1592
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:43,240
The cat picture.

1593
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:45,820
OK, we got one.

1594
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:49,860
And...

1595
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:50,300
Drop!

1596
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:55,180
Guys, my heart...

1597
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:56,440
My ghost...

1598
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:58,420
My ghost...

1599
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:01,840
Oh my gosh, I felt like a heart almost just happened.

1600
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,840
If my heart could stop again...

1601
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:09,180
It wouldn't happen that moment.

1602
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,620
So close.

1603
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:18,840
Holy moly.

1604
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:22,920
What?

1605
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:25,400
That's two times in a row?

1606
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:26,520
Are you kidding me?

1607
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,100
Or not in a row, but seriously?

1608
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:34,000
Who is laughing at me?

1609
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:45,340
This is ridiculous.

1610
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,320
Look at the bamboo ship.

1611
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,000
Thank you.

1612
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:52,560
This is ridiculous.

1613
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,760
What is this?

1614
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,040
OK.

1615
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:19,740
I thought I almost didn't get one.

1616
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,100
For real.

1617
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:25,260
OK.

1618
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:27,920
I am.

1619
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:31,440
Should have done the 500 giant one.

1620
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:34,320
True, right?

1621
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:38,580
True.

1622
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:42,060
Oh man.

1623
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:46,690
OK.

1624
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:50,430
Please.

1625
01:44:50,430 --> 01:44:51,070
Please!

1626
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:56,430
Where did it go?

1627
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:59,010
Wait, I don't even see it.

1628
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:01,730
Where did it go?

1629
01:45:01,990 --> 01:45:03,430
I closed my eyes for luck.

1630
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:04,290
What happened?

1631
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,280
You guys know it didn't.

1632
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,640
It didn't bounce out.

1633
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:26,000
No way!

1634
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:44,920
I closed my eyes for good luck and it bounced.

1635
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:46,200
Wait.

1636
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:48,500
Oh no, I thought they refunded me for a second.

1637
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:50,580
Of course, that would be too kind.

1638
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,300
No way!

1639
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:56,260
OK, I'm going to buy more.

1640
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:05,590
How much should I buy them?

1641
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,100
I'm genuinely impressed, but maybe don't close your eyes next time.

1642
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:27,560
I think if I...

1643
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:31,100
If I win this one...

1644
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,100
And then I...

1645
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:35,880
What's the word?

1646
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:38,520
I can at least buy D, you know?

1647
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:40,720
On Mercari.

1648
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:47,940
It's a business expense.

1649
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:49,080
It's fine.

1650
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:52,840
Wait, where did the balls go?

1651
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:54,500
Where should I go?

1652
01:46:57,980 --> 01:46:59,540
Maybe like right here in the front?

1653
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:02,820
Am I not going to get any balls?

1654
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:04,360
Oh god, please.

1655
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:05,600
Please let me have a ball.

1656
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,260
TWO BALLS!

1657
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:09,780
TWO BALLS!

1658
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:24,680
Oh my god!

1659
01:47:42,110 --> 01:47:45,410
This machine in particular is absolutely haunted.

1660
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:47,350
TWO MORE BALLS!

1661
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:17,170
This grandpa used to have one of those machines.

1662
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:21,270
No way!

1663
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:22,930
How is that possible?

1664
01:48:24,490 --> 01:48:26,410
Excuse me, I won the machine!

1665
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:36,190
Mint only rules natural ones and natural twenties.

1666
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:38,830
I can't believe that happened!

1667
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:40,610
How did that happen?

1668
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:44,350
Please give me the confirmation!

1669
01:48:46,070 --> 01:48:48,410
Please give me the confirmation!

1670
01:48:50,650 --> 01:48:52,850
This is insanity!

1671
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:55,150
How did we do it?

1672
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:59,090
Mint two balls phantom.

1673
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:01,270
How did we do that?

1674
01:49:04,090 --> 01:49:05,170
The blue button.

1675
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:06,050
Prize confirmation.

1676
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:09,510
Oh wait, I don't think I have to do that though.

1677
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:12,810
It usually just shows up in my car.

1678
01:49:14,490 --> 01:49:14,930
Hello!

1679
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:25,520
Mint grabs two balls then two more.

1680
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:30,000
Call me Vulcan.

1681
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:31,620
Wait!

1682
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:31,860
Wait!

1683
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:32,100
Wait!

1684
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:33,860
WAIT!

1685
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:36,500
WAIT!

1686
01:49:46,970 --> 01:49:48,430
What do I do?

1687
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:54,800
I still get the prize?

1688
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:55,200
I do?

1689
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:55,920
OK.

1690
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:57,020
Hold on.

1691
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:58,340
I'm going to do the prize confirmation.

1692
01:49:58,560 --> 01:49:59,340
I have to fill it out.

1693
01:49:59,420 --> 01:49:59,820
Hold on.

1694
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:02,720
I don't know what the machine is though.

1695
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:04,720
Prize confirmation.

1696
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:04,840
Confirmation.

1697
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:11,920
Machine slash prize.

1698
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:12,820
This one.

1699
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:15,660
Prize confirmation.

1700
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:16,980
Confirm.

1701
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:20,020
I have it caught on stream!

1702
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:23,560
I have it caught on stream!

1703
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:26,140
Yeah, they have the video.

1704
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:26,740
It's OK.

1705
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,960
I have it caught on stream even.

1706
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:34,380
I can send them this stream.

1707
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:36,360
OK.

1708
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,540
Well they knocked it out.

1709
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:38,420
Good job dummy.

1710
01:50:44,450 --> 01:50:46,650
Yeah, we have video proof.

1711
01:50:47,110 --> 01:50:48,130
We have video proof.

1712
01:50:48,210 --> 01:50:49,210
I can get out of here though.

1713
01:50:49,290 --> 01:50:49,730
I'm leaving.

1714
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:55,610
Oh my goodness.

1715
01:50:58,930 --> 01:51:00,950
Don't get scammed by claw machine.

1716
01:51:01,590 --> 01:51:05,310
I still only have two things in my car.

1717
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:08,310
I don't know what I was supposed to put with the...

1718
01:51:10,770 --> 01:51:12,450
With the claw machine.

1719
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:15,070
I just put the URL.

1720
01:51:15,450 --> 01:51:16,510
Hopefully it works.

1721
01:51:19,110 --> 01:51:23,930
If they need further proof I'll say here is my stream and here is the timestamp.

1722
01:51:24,710 --> 01:51:26,010
Why didn't you press the button though?

1723
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:29,130
Because you don't have to.

1724
01:51:29,930 --> 01:51:32,470
I didn't press it for any of the other streams.

1725
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:36,250
I think it's just in case something like this happens.

1726
01:51:38,130 --> 01:51:39,810
Oh yeah, let's change it to 3 out of 4.

1727
01:51:39,990 --> 01:51:40,350
Thank you.

1728
01:51:42,190 --> 01:51:42,890
Are you sure?

1729
01:51:43,070 --> 01:51:43,330
Yeah.

1730
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:45,590
I'll get it.

1731
01:51:45,650 --> 01:51:46,350
Don't worry guys.

1732
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:48,390
Yeah, I'll get it.

1733
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:50,250
I can't believe that happened.

1734
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:07,840
Time to get D?

1735
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:10,380
Yeah, I guess so.

1736
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:13,680
I don't know how to feel about that because I'm nervous if I didn't get it or not.

1737
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:16,080
I'm nervous.

1738
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:20,720
I'm like I don't feel satisfied even though it was such a crazy win.

1739
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:22,780
I don't feel satisfied.

1740
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:24,680
Please put it in my cart.

1741
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:28,460
There it is!

1742
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:30,960
OK.

1743
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:31,760
We're good.

1744
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:32,120
We're good.

1745
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:32,500
We're good.

1746
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:32,840
We're good.

1747
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:33,600
We're good.

1748
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:35,920
There we go.

1749
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:36,600
There we go.

1750
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:42,020
Oh my gosh!

1751
01:52:42,020 --> 01:52:43,460
You guys!

1752
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,740
That was so awesome.

1753
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,040
I can't believe I got two balls.

1754
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:51,680
Two times in a row!

1755
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:52,480
And then what?

1756
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,820
The first time the ball got knocked out of the thing.

1757
01:52:56,740 --> 01:52:57,300
Craziness.

1758
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:02,460
I'm almost out of tea.

1759
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:06,080
I got an Arizona tea today.

1760
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:10,120
Wow, they're all in use.

1761
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:12,100
Limited stock.

1762
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:15,620
Which one should we do?

1763
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:19,420
Oh my god, all the 4000s are in use!

1764
01:53:23,610 --> 01:53:25,050
This one has two people waiting.

1765
01:53:27,950 --> 01:53:29,290
Wait, I can just play it.

1766
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:31,730
I get in line though, right?

1767
01:53:34,170 --> 01:53:35,010
For this one.

1768
01:53:38,170 --> 01:53:39,390
Aesthetic green tea.

1769
01:53:39,870 --> 01:53:41,530
I've heard Arizona tea is really nice.

1770
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:43,170
It's like...

1771
01:53:43,170 --> 01:53:45,030
If you want green tea...

1772
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:47,450
Like a real green tea flavor...

1773
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:48,890
Then don't...

1774
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:50,430
It's not the tea.

1775
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:52,430
You know?

1776
01:53:52,530 --> 01:53:55,710
But if you're wanting kind of a sweet tea flavor...

1777
01:53:55,710 --> 01:53:57,510
It has honey and stuff in it.

1778
01:53:58,050 --> 01:53:59,230
Yeah, it's really sugary.

1779
01:53:59,590 --> 01:54:00,530
I don't get them often.

1780
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:04,270
I'm struggling hard to get this Yui.

1781
01:54:04,690 --> 01:54:05,970
You got this, Fleshy!

1782
01:54:07,390 --> 01:54:08,710
Is this person still going?

1783
01:54:11,530 --> 01:54:12,530
I'm in the queue.

1784
01:54:13,410 --> 01:54:14,810
This is D, right?

1785
01:54:15,490 --> 01:54:16,190
Yeah, D.

1786
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:19,470
I'm in the queue!

1787
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:25,030
It's a very good beverage, but yeah, not standard green tea.

1788
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:27,990
Oh, I love the mango juice one.

1789
01:54:28,010 --> 01:54:29,130
It's so good, right?

1790
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:31,070
You like Japanese green tea?

1791
01:54:31,410 --> 01:54:31,670
Yeah!

1792
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:33,590
I love it.

1793
01:54:33,870 --> 01:54:34,490
Yummy, yummy.

1794
01:54:34,490 --> 01:54:35,190
Ahem.

1795
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:42,520
Hi, D.

1796
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:43,560
Oh my gosh.

1797
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:45,460
It's the Shagohan.

1798
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:46,940
It's so cute.

1799
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:50,300
Oh my gosh, I can't wait to display all of these in my cabinet.

1800
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:51,960
And then...

1801
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,920
I don't think I will probably...

1802
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:56,200
I don't think I will probably...

1803
01:54:57,820 --> 01:54:58,260
Nyaru!

1804
01:54:58,760 --> 01:54:59,680
Thanks for the raid!

1805
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:00,900
Thank you!

1806
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:03,120
Hello!

1807
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:04,560
Welcome back!

1808
01:55:07,540 --> 01:55:08,800
Oh, they're back.

1809
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:10,700
Welcome, welcome!

1810
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:11,980
Thanks for the five gifted!

1811
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:15,260
What if you went back to the 500 points?

1812
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,580
Murphy, thanks for the gifted!

1813
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:24,280
You guys, we just had a crazy play.

1814
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:25,060
I'm telling you.

1815
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:27,380
Frog for Robin, thanks for the five gifted!

1816
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,600
Sirstreak, thanks for the five gifted!

1817
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:30,900
You guys are too generous.

1818
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:31,720
Thank you, thank you.

1819
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,500
Thanks for the five gifted!

1820
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:34,800
Thank you guys!

1821
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:37,440
Try the 500 TP.

1822
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:40,980
I think this person... Oh, I thought they were going to get two balls.

1823
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:43,780
I'm a professional ball holder.

1824
01:55:44,860 --> 01:55:46,380
Nobody can have two balls but me.

1825
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:50,820
I

1826
01:56:01,310 --> 01:56:03,790
know I had to catch your bots lately with my new schedule.

1827
01:56:04,670 --> 01:56:05,470
Customer Johnson!

1828
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:07,570
Congrats on your 3.0.

1829
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:11,610
It's nice to see big indie streamers like yourself help promote small time business in my house.

1830
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:15,090
Stop it!

1831
01:56:18,310 --> 01:56:19,410
You think they're going to... Oh!

1832
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:20,410
Is it my turn?

1833
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:21,850
No, just kidding.

1834
01:56:23,290 --> 01:56:24,530
I saw waiting zero.

1835
01:56:24,710 --> 01:56:25,770
Oh wait, it is my turn!

1836
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:27,210
Oh my gosh, it's my turn!

1837
01:56:29,790 --> 01:56:30,230
Wait!

1838
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:33,070
Wait, they just... They gave up, I think.

1839
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:34,970
They gave up, I think.

1840
01:56:35,090 --> 01:56:35,590
Oh my god.

1841
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:37,810
No way!

1842
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:03,480
I have an XP!

1843
01:57:06,020 --> 01:57:06,900
No way!

1844
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,060
This is insanity!

1845
01:57:08,860 --> 01:57:10,320
Where did the other ball go though?

1846
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:12,820
Where did it go?

1847
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:16,580
Alright, come on in the middle!

1848
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:20,120
Oh my gosh, is this one really rigged?

1849
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:21,740
Why are they all getting stuck on the sides?

1850
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:24,540
Oh, it went back in the dish.

1851
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:25,200
Aw man.

1852
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:26,000
Nappy!

1853
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:26,660
Thanks for the gift!

1854
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,800
It's all in the wrists, my limp wrists.

1855
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:34,380
600 something thousand.

1856
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,480
I'm living for this ambiance, honestly.

1857
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:37,940
It's so funny.

1858
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:41,600
I don't know if it's as loud for you guys as it is for me.

1859
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:43,160
OK!

1860
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:47,240
My ghost, she lost a ball.

1861
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,000
You can call me Jojolion.

1862
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,400
Nappy, thanks for another gifted!

1863
01:58:09,940 --> 01:58:10,740
Was it an extra?

1864
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:11,860
I thought he had only one.

1865
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:18,140
Oh come on!

1866
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:19,400
This one's crazy!

1867
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:23,920
Oh my gosh, he had four.

1868
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,380
I thought he was missing.

1869
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:28,740
Wait, he had four?

1870
01:58:33,620 --> 01:58:35,160
Guys, this might not be the one.

1871
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:37,060
I have two chances left.

1872
01:58:42,750 --> 01:58:43,550
Single ball.

1873
01:58:45,210 --> 01:58:46,090
Come on!

1874
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:51,580
So close.

1875
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:59,140
I think it gets harder the more that stack up in there because they all start bouncing off of each other.

1876
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:01,360
The other balls make yours bounce too much.

1877
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:03,000
I think that's actually the case.

1878
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:10,120
Yeah, I think I actually... I think I scammed myself into doing this one.

1879
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:14,700
How many balls do you need to get the prize?

1880
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:17,920
You just need to get it in this little red circle right here in the middle.

1881
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,540
Yeah, this is actually harder.

1882
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:24,640
Maybe I scammed myself.

1883
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:27,740
I don't think this one has assist mode.

1884
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:33,080
It's starting to block the middle.

1885
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:36,700
You can do it!

1886
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:42,440
If you believe in me...

1887
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:44,320
I believe in me!

1888
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:48,960
Two balls!

1889
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:50,100
One ball!

1890
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:51,820
Go ball go!

1891
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:53,300
Into the middle!

1892
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:57,240
So close!

1893
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:02,000
We were so close.

1894
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:03,380
It moved.

1895
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:04,580
It was so close.

1896
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:06,780
Dang.

1897
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:08,560
Oh wait, I have enough for one more.

1898
02:00:11,020 --> 02:00:12,360
I can still get one in.

1899
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:13,300
I can still get one in.

1900
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:13,880
Next ball.

1901
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:15,720
One more!

1902
02:00:20,230 --> 02:00:21,030
Oh my god!

1903
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:22,370
What the... Oh my gosh.

1904
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:22,670
Wait.

1905
02:00:22,930 --> 02:00:24,330
I didn't know that I accidentally hit it.

1906
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,440
It's grandpa though.

1907
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:00,520
Wait, how do you have a Wolverine?

1908
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:02,740
You guys, do I buy more?

1909
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:13,070
Where is the sobbing on the uncontrollably sticker?

1910
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:17,490
No balls, yet it still hurts.

1911
02:01:18,150 --> 02:01:19,430
It's the Phantom Pain.

1912
02:01:19,950 --> 02:01:21,250
It's the Phantom Pain.

1913
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:29,810
Give a little bit.

1914
02:01:30,630 --> 02:01:33,490
Give a little bit of your love.

1915
02:01:37,860 --> 02:01:41,400
Ok, I'll do...

1916
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:45,160
I'll do 20 dollars.

1917
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:49,580
I don't know how much I've spent.

1918
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:51,000
Maybe like 200 dollars.

1919
02:01:51,420 --> 02:01:53,140
When I could have bought this.

1920
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:58,180
For 60 dollars.

1921
02:01:59,180 --> 02:02:04,940
On my own

1922
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:08,940
everybody.

1923
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:13,240
I did it all on my own with only one assist.

1924
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:25,300
With only one assist.

1925
02:02:35,590 --> 02:02:37,490
Oh my gosh, why was it so violent?

1926
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:49,160
Are you kidding me?

1927
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:52,380
I look like a mad person even though I didn't even start this one.

1928
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:55,280
I look like the mad person because I'm continuing it.

1929
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:56,160
Like seriously!

1930
02:03:01,070 --> 02:03:03,830
These are way less fun when actual money is on the line.

1931
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:09,690
I hate to encourage, encourage gambling, but...

1932
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:18,260
4000 TP!

1933
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:20,840
I should be guaranteed a ball!

1934
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:27,320
It's because I got the two balls before you guys.

1935
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:29,080
It's because I got the two balls.

1936
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:32,220
It's because I got the two balls.

1937
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:49,620
Gosh, I'm just worried about getting a ball more than anything.

1938
02:03:54,990 --> 02:03:56,270
Hello assist!

1939
02:03:56,630 --> 02:03:57,230
Can you see?

1940
02:03:57,310 --> 02:03:58,530
This thing is full!

1941
02:03:58,850 --> 02:04:00,150
It's full of balls!

1942
02:04:00,250 --> 02:04:02,210
Can we please clear the balls out?

1943
02:04:02,910 --> 02:04:03,550
Please!

1944
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:10,230
Excuse me!

1945
02:04:11,410 --> 02:04:13,650
There should be like an alert button or something.

1946
02:04:14,950 --> 02:04:17,610
Old two ball mentor caught dropping balls live.

1947
02:04:25,150 --> 02:04:27,530
It's full of balls!

1948
02:04:28,890 --> 02:04:30,670
I'm no quitter.

1949
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:39,540
I'm Volgin.

1950
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:42,000
I'm Volgin.

1951
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:43,200
I go for the balls.

1952
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:53,040
Guys!

1953
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:57,100
Guys!

1954
02:04:57,100 --> 02:04:57,280
Please!

1955
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:01,900
It might be over chat.

1956
02:05:02,060 --> 02:05:02,580
It might be.

1957
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:04,880
It might be over chat.

1958
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:12,000
Sunk cost fallacy.

1959
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:31,610
I was hoping for a miracle!

1960
02:05:33,110 --> 02:05:35,010
I was hoping for a miracle.

1961
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:42,840
Let's see if anybody else playing gets it.

1962
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,080
There was one person waiting.

1963
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,480
She did the famous minced double ball grab.

1964
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:50,440
I wish I did it again.

1965
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:53,460
Are they going to try?

1966
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:55,320
This person in line.

1967
02:05:56,780 --> 02:05:57,880
I wish to see.

1968
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:00,120
Next person is going to get it.

1969
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:01,220
I hope so!

1970
02:06:30,590 --> 02:06:31,310
Balls!

1971
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:33,250
Do it!

1972
02:06:33,310 --> 02:06:33,790
No balls!

1973
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:37,610
He almost had a two baller!

1974
02:06:38,550 --> 02:06:39,870
You got this!

1975
02:06:41,750 --> 02:06:43,130
That would have been me.

1976
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:46,870
That's grandpa.

1977
02:06:46,870 --> 02:06:47,650
Why is that one?

1978
02:07:02,300 --> 02:07:03,460
No balls.

1979
02:07:03,540 --> 02:07:05,080
Does this mean not November?

1980
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:07,040
Non-stop not November.

1981
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:09,100
Wait!

1982
02:07:10,580 --> 02:07:12,240
Wait, they have it!

1983
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:14,040
No way!

1984
02:07:14,140 --> 02:07:14,320
Wait.

1985
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:16,120
Did they...

1986
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:19,220
Did they get it then?

1987
02:07:20,540 --> 02:07:21,940
They knocked it in?

1988
02:07:23,820 --> 02:07:27,940
Wait, I realized that because I'm not watching I didn't see the...

1989
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:30,640
Yay for you!

1990
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:33,380
It fell.

1991
02:07:37,630 --> 02:07:38,750
It counts.

1992
02:07:39,530 --> 02:07:42,390
I didn't see the little thingy pop up to be like...

1993
02:07:42,730 --> 02:07:43,210
Congratulations!

1994
02:07:44,030 --> 02:07:46,090
So I didn't...

1995
02:07:46,090 --> 02:07:47,030
There we go.

1996
02:07:47,270 --> 02:07:48,810
They got it in two more tries.

1997
02:07:52,710 --> 02:07:54,530
It almost looks like it's sticking up though.

1998
02:07:54,590 --> 02:07:55,250
I wonder if it...

1999
02:07:55,250 --> 02:07:57,010
It feels like it didn't activate the...

2000
02:07:59,310 --> 02:07:59,910
You know.

2001
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:05,190
The little thingy.

2002
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:10,870
I'll get it to you one of these days.

2003
02:08:11,610 --> 02:08:12,250
No, no, no.

2004
02:08:12,290 --> 02:08:12,990
I'm getting my own.

2005
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:13,370
It's OK.

2006
02:08:15,730 --> 02:08:17,310
Thank you though, but I'm getting my own.

2007
02:08:17,310 --> 02:08:17,310
Eventually.

2008
02:08:18,710 --> 02:08:19,010
Somehow.

2009
02:08:19,550 --> 02:08:20,010
Someway.

2010
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:20,830
Somewhere.

2011
02:08:21,150 --> 02:08:21,610
Somehow.

2012
02:08:22,210 --> 02:08:22,630
In here?

2013
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:23,390
Who knows.

2014
02:08:23,690 --> 02:08:24,130
Mercari?

2015
02:08:24,370 --> 02:08:24,830
I don't know.

2016
02:08:25,150 --> 02:08:25,670
Who cares.

2017
02:08:28,690 --> 02:08:30,750
Yeah, you wouldn't get the congrats since it's another player.

2018
02:08:30,830 --> 02:08:33,270
I realized that after I said it.

2019
02:08:33,470 --> 02:08:35,570
I was just like, wait, I didn't see the congrats.

2020
02:08:36,150 --> 02:08:37,850
Duh, because it wasn't me.

2021
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:50,240
7 remaining.

2022
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:51,760
3 remaining of B.

2023
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:56,360
Do I duel?

2024
02:08:57,580 --> 02:08:59,000
Where is the 500 one?

2025
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:02,720
Where is the 500 one?

2026
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:04,900
So many of these are in use.

2027
02:09:04,940 --> 02:09:05,560
Oh, here it is.

2028
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:09,080
It has even more now.

2029
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:12,700
Look how it used to be just a couple.

2030
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:13,880
It's even more now.

2031
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:17,980
You think I should just do this for the rest of the time?

2032
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:21,180
Are you winning, Minto?

2033
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:22,120
I think so.

2034
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:27,980
Are there any others that are 500?

2035
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:29,000
Except that one.

2036
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:34,700
We could do the 50,000.

2037
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:37,800
500.

2038
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:41,700
This one is also 50,000.

2039
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:42,780
Oh, sorry, 5,000.

2040
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:45,160
Nevermind, not 50,000.

2041
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:52,140
Oh, it seems a bit more lenient, perhaps.

2042
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:55,140
600 something thousand.

2043
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:02,780
Oh, there is this one.

2044
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:05,160
Oh wait, that's the one we were just looking at.

2045
02:10:05,700 --> 02:10:07,400
This one is 12,000.

2046
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:08,480
Holy moly.

2047
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:09,900
I think that's the only 500.

2048
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:15,820
Oh wait, I could just control.

2049
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:20,300
Wait, one of 13.

2050
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:22,460
Oh, because it's showing me these 500s.

2051
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:22,820
Just kidding.

2052
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:25,060
Where did it go?

2053
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:30,620
500, 500, 500, 500.

2054
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:31,720
Here we go.

2055
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:38,240
500, 25,600 minutes.

2056
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:43,380
Grab a ping pong ball with your arm.

2057
02:10:43,780 --> 02:10:48,940
When the prize of the ping pong ball falls into the red hole, the display prize cannot be acquired.

2058
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:51,220
What's the display prize?

2059
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:56,420
Ok, let's just try it.

2060
02:10:57,600 --> 02:10:58,500
Thank you!

2061
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:01,120
Start?

2062
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,580
Oh my gosh, it feels so easy to miss.

2063
02:11:17,220 --> 02:11:19,280
I got a ball, I got a ball!

2064
02:11:20,140 --> 02:11:21,500
I got one, I got one, I got one.

2065
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:23,900
Let's go ball!

2066
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:37,280
It just immediately joined it's pack.

2067
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:39,200
It joined it's team.

2068
02:11:52,970 --> 02:11:53,670
I got a ball!

2069
02:11:54,330 --> 02:11:59,970
I wonder if you have to saturate this area with balls and then...

2070
02:12:00,550 --> 02:12:07,570
Oh my gosh, you have to absolutely saturate this area with balls until they just eventually roll down.

2071
02:12:10,310 --> 02:12:11,750
Saturate with the balls, yeah.

2072
02:12:12,270 --> 02:12:13,350
Take a lot of balls.

2073
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:15,590
I don't think I have that many balls.

2074
02:12:19,270 --> 02:12:20,250
I don't like this one.

2075
02:12:24,150 --> 02:12:24,510
Guys...

2076
02:12:25,950 --> 02:12:26,590
I don't know.

2077
02:12:26,710 --> 02:12:29,630
I'm conflicted because I want to win it, obviously.

2078
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:34,270
I want to win my own, but I don't want to pay...

2079
02:12:35,350 --> 02:12:40,310
I don't know if I want to pay so much more to do it.

2080
02:12:41,830 --> 02:12:44,570
I don't know if I want to pay so much more to do it.

2081
02:12:58,470 --> 02:13:04,210
How much is it on Mercari?

2082
02:13:04,370 --> 02:13:04,810
Let's chat.

2083
02:13:08,810 --> 02:13:09,170
No!

2084
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:10,430
No, no, no.

2085
02:13:10,510 --> 02:13:12,370
Please, actually, I will turn off super chats.

2086
02:13:12,510 --> 02:13:13,350
Please, no, no, no.

2087
02:13:17,610 --> 02:13:17,970
Mercari...

2088
02:13:19,050 --> 02:13:21,330
I got to make sure I'm not logged in or anything.

2089
02:13:23,970 --> 02:13:24,910
Okay, I'm good.

2090
02:13:27,630 --> 02:13:29,710
So here's Mercari Japan, right?

2091
02:13:30,650 --> 02:13:32,430
This is Mercari Japan, right?

2092
02:13:32,870 --> 02:13:35,270
Okay, these are my last searches.

2093
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:39,630
Metal Gear, Power Pro, guys, because I was looking for more little snakes.

2094
02:13:40,130 --> 02:13:42,330
Metal Gear poster, Metal Gear...

2095
02:13:44,810 --> 02:13:46,330
So let's see...

2096
02:13:49,190 --> 02:13:50,310
Let's see...

2097
02:13:51,330 --> 02:13:52,870
Wait, where are all the tumblers?

2098
02:13:53,470 --> 02:13:54,310
Oh my gosh.

2099
02:13:54,970 --> 02:13:58,970
There used to be... There were like so many at the top here.

2100
02:13:59,450 --> 02:14:00,690
Just earlier today.

2101
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:06,120
Where did all the...

2102
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,480
Where did all the tumblers go?

2103
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:13,700
Where

2104
02:14:18,330 --> 02:14:19,910
did all the tumblers go?

2105
02:14:22,410 --> 02:14:24,550
Oh my gosh, they have this!

2106
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:26,130
Oh, but I want the Meiling!

2107
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:31,000
Oh my gosh, no!

2108
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:33,520
Okay, I'll get that later.

2109
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:34,620
Nobody else buy it, please.

2110
02:14:35,140 --> 02:14:38,780
This is why I never do like online things, because I'm scared of...

2111
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:39,740
Look at the Pico Park.

2112
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:42,280
Oh my gosh, where did all the tumblers go?

2113
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:45,360
Wait, actually, where did all the tumblers go?

2114
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,520
No way.

2115
02:14:54,540 --> 02:14:56,120
I don't even see them under... Wait.

2116
02:14:57,580 --> 02:14:57,840
Huh?

2117
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,060
What's wrong with my thing?

2118
02:15:05,260 --> 02:15:07,220
I don't even see them under the sold out.

2119
02:15:10,180 --> 02:15:10,580
Huh?

2120
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:11,600
Where did they all go?

2121
02:15:11,940 --> 02:15:13,320
Oh wait, I'm not on the front page.

2122
02:15:13,420 --> 02:15:13,680
That's why.

2123
02:15:14,620 --> 02:15:15,860
Oh my gosh!

2124
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:17,780
This is why I need to check everyday!

2125
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:20,320
Look how cute the Karutan mug is!

2126
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:23,120
Oh yeah, here's one.

2127
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:26,140
Oh, here's another.

2128
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:26,900
Oh, here's another.

2129
02:15:27,080 --> 02:15:28,580
Oh, here's another.

2130
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:30,160
Oh, here's another.

2131
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:31,860
Oh, there's another.

2132
02:15:33,780 --> 02:15:37,360
Try adding Tumblr to your search.

2133
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:38,600
I saw a bunch on the app.

2134
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:39,020
Oh really?

2135
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:41,360
That's weird.

2136
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:43,860
Oh, there's Tumblr.

2137
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:45,300
Oh, whoops.

2138
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:46,360
Is it right there?

2139
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:48,520
Huh?

2140
02:15:51,220 --> 02:15:52,800
What's wrong with my Mercari?

2141
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:55,760
What's wrong with my Mercari?

2142
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:58,040
Hold on, let me go back to the beginning.

2143
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:01,040
This is so weird.

2144
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:02,960
Oh, there they are!

2145
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:05,320
See guys, they were here.

2146
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,100
That was weird.

2147
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:10,220
That's never happened to me before.

2148
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:14,360
I don't know which one is the one where... Oh, I'm guessing the green one.

2149
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:16,840
So that sounds like two, right?

2150
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:17,760
I'm sorry, three.

2151
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:23,400
I love all that!

2152
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:31,280
So these are the... This is what the Tumblr is coming.

2153
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:32,240
Isn't it so cute?

2154
02:16:32,340 --> 02:16:34,520
It says like live snakes inside and everything.

2155
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:35,700
It's so, so cute!

2156
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:39,380
But it doesn't say which game it is.

2157
02:16:41,300 --> 02:16:43,220
So yeah, see it was like going for 50.

2158
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:47,040
I spent way more, but I got them.

2159
02:16:48,260 --> 02:16:51,320
I got them with my own hands.

2160
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:53,300
I did it myself.

2161
02:16:53,820 --> 02:16:54,940
How much is just one?

2162
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:56,340
If I can find one...

2163
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:03,640
These ones are 25.

2164
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,840
There are two of them, but...

2165
02:17:12,380 --> 02:17:14,120
They are so cute.

2166
02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:15,560
Oh my gosh, I can't wait to get them.

2167
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:17,380
I can't wait to get them!

2168
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:20,180
You earned them.

2169
02:17:20,220 --> 02:17:21,180
Yeah, I earned them.

2170
02:17:21,220 --> 02:17:22,020
I earned them.

2171
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:26,800
But I got more crane game points.

2172
02:17:28,480 --> 02:17:30,080
We shall crane game again.

2173
02:17:30,740 --> 02:17:32,440
Back to the cranes, everybody.

2174
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:34,980
Back to the cranes!

2175
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:38,340
I will get this on my own.

2176
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:46,520
Back to the cranes!

2177
02:17:48,940 --> 02:17:50,680
The cranes call.

2178
02:17:56,960 --> 02:17:59,120
You can get your cool Tumblr.

2179
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:00,560
Believe in me that believes in you.

2180
02:18:00,560 --> 02:18:01,620
Thank you!

2181
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:04,900
I didn't check how much I have left on my credit card.

2182
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:06,940
I should be fine.

2183
02:18:09,460 --> 02:18:11,820
I might have to be making a payment.

2184
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:21,260
We are back baby.

2185
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:26,500
We are back baby!

2186
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:29,640
Metal Gear is off the front page again.

2187
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:33,640
I wonder if this one is the...

2188
02:18:36,920 --> 02:18:38,040
And it's tilted!

2189
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:42,720
You guys...

2190
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:46,960
That's close.

2191
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:48,280
Easy one.

2192
02:18:48,460 --> 02:18:49,180
How do I do it?

2193
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:49,760
How do I do it?

2194
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:50,080
No!

2195
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:52,540
I'm in the queue.

2196
02:18:56,380 --> 02:18:57,940
I want to see how they do it.

2197
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:01,320
Let's see.

2198
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:14,380
No balls, no groceries for Tumblr.

2199
02:19:23,750 --> 02:19:25,370
How would you do it though?

2200
02:19:25,550 --> 02:19:27,310
What's the strat here?

2201
02:19:41,860 --> 02:19:45,580
I don't think it's DMCA.

2202
02:19:45,700 --> 02:19:46,620
I don't think it's loud enough.

2203
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:48,200
I should be fine.

2204
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:49,240
Don't worry about it.

2205
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:50,200
Thanks though for worrying.

2206
02:19:50,380 --> 02:19:51,240
It's all good I think.

2207
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:57,160
If I get hit, I probably will just say you can't monetize the stream.

2208
02:19:57,480 --> 02:19:59,280
But that happens to like every stream of mine.

2209
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:01,460
So it's okay.

2210
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,260
They have matte tape grip on the bars.

2211
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:07,180
He's just wobbling it.

2212
02:20:07,180 --> 02:20:08,320
He's not moving it at all.

2213
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:10,460
How would you do this one?

2214
02:20:12,780 --> 02:20:13,660
Turn it a little?

2215
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:16,480
I would have to push it from this part here right?

2216
02:20:16,660 --> 02:20:17,960
Like this little corner here maybe?

2217
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:22,460
From the back you want to swipe it close to the corner.

2218
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:31,460
Oh they are

2219
02:20:34,750 --> 02:20:35,050
trying.

2220
02:20:39,670 --> 02:20:41,850
Oh they are really close!

2221
02:20:42,250 --> 02:20:46,330
Oh my gosh.

2222
02:20:46,410 --> 02:20:51,390
Wait, I think...it feels like they are not gonna...I feel like they are...I can't tell.

2223
02:20:56,630 --> 02:20:58,890
It moved, but is it moving in the correct direction?

2224
02:20:59,010 --> 02:20:59,530
It needs to go.

2225
02:20:59,970 --> 02:21:00,870
I can't tell.

2226
02:21:04,890 --> 02:21:05,890
Stop rooting for them.

2227
02:21:05,930 --> 02:21:07,310
I want to root for everybody!

2228
02:21:08,490 --> 02:21:10,350
I want to root for everybody!

2229
02:21:11,230 --> 02:21:12,330
Go, go, go!

2230
02:21:16,970 --> 02:21:18,830
Yeah, they might flip it down and flat.

2231
02:21:18,910 --> 02:21:20,170
I know, that's how I'm feeling.

2232
02:21:20,590 --> 02:21:22,570
I feel like they need to go for this corner instead.

2233
02:21:22,910 --> 02:21:23,890
But it's harder to see.

2234
02:21:30,570 --> 02:21:30,970
Oh,

2235
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:35,070
they listened to me.

2236
02:21:37,970 --> 02:21:40,450
They actually listened to me.

2237
02:21:40,830 --> 02:21:42,530
Oh my gosh!

2238
02:21:50,260 --> 02:21:51,080
You think they will win?

2239
02:21:51,460 --> 02:21:52,460
As long as they don't give up.

2240
02:21:54,220 --> 02:21:55,840
Go, go, go!

2241
02:21:57,640 --> 02:21:59,600
The weight distribution seems weird.

2242
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:00,280
Right?

2243
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:02,640
It's weird that it's like...

2244
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:06,180
Not the actual product either, you know?

2245
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:10,260
So they could be putting like bricks in here.

2246
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:12,620
And we wouldn't even know.

2247
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:14,200
Right?

2248
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:16,040
Like...

2249
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:19,820
Use the right claw to drag the corner on the bar that's closest to the left.

2250
02:22:20,720 --> 02:22:21,200
This one?

2251
02:22:29,630 --> 02:22:30,630
Let's see!

2252
02:22:31,630 --> 02:22:34,070
The weight distribution is really weird.

2253
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:34,490
Huh?

2254
02:22:36,450 --> 02:22:38,190
But it's almost flat again.

2255
02:22:38,330 --> 02:22:39,830
It's almost bad.

2256
02:22:43,210 --> 02:22:46,270
It's almost back to being flat again I feel.

2257
02:22:54,070 --> 02:22:56,310
Could be the material on the bars too.

2258
02:22:56,650 --> 02:22:57,150
Potentially.

2259
02:22:57,970 --> 02:22:58,610
Potentially.

2260
02:22:59,410 --> 02:23:00,270
Wait, flat is good?

2261
02:23:03,210 --> 02:23:04,230
My turn?

2262
02:23:05,630 --> 02:23:07,610
Wait, you want to get it flat then lift it.

2263
02:23:07,670 --> 02:23:08,210
Wait, huh?

2264
02:23:22,420 --> 02:23:24,220
Which part do I aim for?

2265
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:25,980
Oh my gosh.

2266
02:23:26,420 --> 02:23:27,080
I'm scared!

2267
02:23:30,340 --> 02:23:31,520
Oh my god.

2268
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:33,980
Stuck diagonally is really hard.

2269
02:23:34,660 --> 02:23:36,620
Lift the corner that is sticking up.

2270
02:23:38,900 --> 02:23:40,300
Ok, this one?

2271
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:42,360
This one?

2272
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:43,720
Oh gosh.

2273
02:24:11,060 --> 02:24:11,660
Uh...

2274
02:24:12,780 --> 02:24:13,800
Nice push.

2275
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:17,040
It didn't move.

2276
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:25,410
Oh gosh.

2277
02:24:25,950 --> 02:24:26,690
Did I go too far?

2278
02:24:32,450 --> 02:24:33,710
Aim for the front?

2279
02:24:33,890 --> 02:24:34,730
Wait, which is the front?

2280
02:24:36,530 --> 02:24:37,810
Oh dang it.

2281
02:24:40,470 --> 02:24:41,790
Stay close to the left.

2282
02:24:43,790 --> 02:24:44,850
It's so heavy.

2283
02:24:46,750 --> 02:24:48,730
The front is the front.

2284
02:24:54,640 --> 02:24:55,580
Maybe like here?

2285
02:24:56,520 --> 02:24:57,660
There is a little more to the left.

2286
02:24:58,060 --> 02:24:58,960
A little to the left.

2287
02:24:59,020 --> 02:24:59,680
That was a fun game.

2288
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:04,120
Oh my gosh.

2289
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:05,120
Oh my gosh.

2290
02:25:05,180 --> 02:25:05,640
Oh my gosh.

2291
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:11,580
It's full of bricks.

2292
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:14,580
It's full of bricks.

2293
02:25:17,500 --> 02:25:19,580
This grandpa used to have one of those lights.

2294
02:25:23,950 --> 02:25:26,130
Wait, I thought I pressed start already.

2295
02:25:26,910 --> 02:25:27,510
Ok, there we go.

2296
02:25:42,200 --> 02:25:46,850
Do you think I can push it down?

2297
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:51,410
From the...from right here?

2298
02:25:51,490 --> 02:25:53,030
Do you think I can push it down or no?

2299
02:25:58,920 --> 02:26:00,140
Barely grabbed the corner.

2300
02:26:04,270 --> 02:26:05,450
Sometimes it works.

2301
02:26:07,370 --> 02:26:09,770
Ok, how wide is this open?

2302
02:26:10,590 --> 02:26:13,270
It's hard for me to gauge sometimes.

2303
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:21,520
Like if I push...

2304
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:23,780
If I push...

2305
02:26:23,780 --> 02:26:26,680
Well, I think it's actually...no, I don't think it would work.

2306
02:26:34,340 --> 02:26:38,280
Trying to get one of the corners, like this one, but it's tricky for me.

2307
02:26:42,820 --> 02:26:43,720
Oh, ok.

2308
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:47,360
People are lining up.

2309
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:48,900
It's ok.

2310
02:26:51,320 --> 02:26:52,360
I'll keep going.

2311
02:26:53,580 --> 02:26:54,860
Oh, did I go too far?

2312
02:26:55,480 --> 02:26:56,540
Did I go too far?

2313
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:08,140
Oh, it's so heavy!

2314
02:27:12,550 --> 02:27:14,150
I went too far to the right, I think.

2315
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:15,490
Ok, hold on.

2316
02:27:18,890 --> 02:27:19,370
Start!

2317
02:27:19,370 --> 02:27:19,850
Start!

2318
02:27:22,650 --> 02:27:23,890
Maybe like there, ok.

2319
02:27:26,470 --> 02:27:27,910
Might be too far to the left?

2320
02:27:28,130 --> 02:27:29,210
I'm getting a feel of it.

2321
02:27:30,530 --> 02:27:30,970
Oh,

2322
02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:34,890
no.

2323
02:27:37,110 --> 02:27:38,870
I didn't move at all!

2324
02:27:39,570 --> 02:27:41,050
I didn't move at all!

2325
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:44,350
Not far enough to the left, seriously?

2326
02:27:48,390 --> 02:27:50,430
That guy in the background, I don't think so.

2327
02:27:53,270 --> 02:27:55,910
It's like the people in this arcade are talking to me for real.

2328
02:28:11,210 --> 02:28:12,390
That's a little awkward.

2329
02:28:14,630 --> 02:28:15,430
Bold strategies.

2330
02:28:17,930 --> 02:28:19,510
I think I...

2331
02:28:20,310 --> 02:28:21,510
How did it just like...

2332
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:23,510
How did it just...

2333
02:28:29,730 --> 02:28:31,810
That's a move just a bit more to the front, ok.

2334
02:28:35,510 --> 02:28:36,030
Hey, baby.

2335
02:28:40,140 --> 02:28:41,220
Oops, wait.

2336
02:28:41,580 --> 02:28:42,220
Will that be ok?

2337
02:28:42,660 --> 02:28:43,120
Oh god.

2338
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:45,400
I think I'm stabbing the machine.

2339
02:28:53,820 --> 02:28:54,780
This one!

2340
02:28:56,500 --> 02:28:57,620
I'm stabbing it.

2341
02:28:57,720 --> 02:28:58,860
I'm killing it.

2342
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:00,100
It's fine.

2343
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:03,540
1, 2, 3, 4.

2344
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:16,020
How am I... Am I doing this right?

2345
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:17,640
I feel like I'm not doing it at all.

2346
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:20,730
I feel like I'm not doing it at all.

2347
02:29:22,380 --> 02:29:24,220
Align the claw to the front bar.

2348
02:29:32,180 --> 02:29:34,100
Drop it right behind this.

2349
02:29:34,540 --> 02:29:37,340
So drop it right here.

2350
02:29:41,060 --> 02:29:41,980
Like right there.

2351
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:48,700
Thanks guys.

2352
02:29:48,760 --> 02:29:52,500
I don't mind the backseating so much for this because I don't have any experience.

2353
02:30:00,880 --> 02:30:01,480
Oh!

2354
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:19,800
What am I... Where should I position it more at?

2355
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:22,080
The claw is so limp, I know.

2356
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:30,800
I have no confidence.

2357
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:31,100
I have no confidence.

2358
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:36,920
Real sumimasen moment.

2359
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:38,060
For real.

2360
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:40,260
A bit forward.

2361
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:42,280
I think you guys gotta be more specific.

2362
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:44,340
I don't know what forward.

2363
02:30:44,460 --> 02:30:48,200
If you're talking forward here or forward here.

2364
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:53,240
If you guys are trying to help, try to be as specific as possible.

2365
02:31:16,930 --> 02:31:17,690
Maybe.

2366
02:31:23,650 --> 02:31:24,990
It's gonna touch it.

2367
02:31:25,670 --> 02:31:29,390
It's just like... It brushed fingers.

2368
02:31:33,950 --> 02:31:35,970
Still not close enough to the bar.

2369
02:31:36,550 --> 02:31:36,830
Really?

2370
02:31:37,150 --> 02:31:37,930
I think so.

2371
02:31:41,150 --> 02:31:43,690
It's angled and low strength of the claw.

2372
02:31:44,290 --> 02:31:45,250
Staff-san!

2373
02:31:45,930 --> 02:31:46,690
Sumimasen!

2374
02:31:47,010 --> 02:31:47,970
This is difficult.

2375
02:31:48,470 --> 02:31:49,030
I can't do it.

2376
02:31:49,990 --> 02:31:50,710
Staff-san!

2377
02:31:51,990 --> 02:31:53,430
Staff-san, where are you?

2378
02:31:55,450 --> 02:31:56,630
Is the back lighter to lift?

2379
02:31:56,670 --> 02:31:57,630
Let's try it.

2380
02:32:00,850 --> 02:32:02,490
Maybe I went over too far, but that's ok.

2381
02:32:08,690 --> 02:32:11,050
Let's see what it looks like if I try to lift up the back.

2382
02:32:12,190 --> 02:32:12,870
It...

2383
02:32:15,050 --> 02:32:18,450
It's a fucking lip-armed toreba machine!

2384
02:32:19,190 --> 02:32:20,370
Why are you so limp?

2385
02:32:21,210 --> 02:32:22,670
Maybe I gotta sweet talk it.

2386
02:32:23,410 --> 02:32:24,830
How do you turn on a claw machine?

2387
02:32:27,250 --> 02:32:28,810
How do you turn one on?

2388
02:32:29,810 --> 02:32:31,150
Oh, toreba machine.

2389
02:32:32,670 --> 02:32:36,090
You have such long claws.

2390
02:32:36,090 --> 02:32:39,550
And call it a good boy?

2391
02:32:39,670 --> 02:32:41,050
Oh, you good boy, you.

2392
02:32:41,610 --> 02:32:42,350
Toreba machine.

2393
02:32:44,390 --> 02:32:47,090
You have such long...

2394
02:32:48,730 --> 02:32:53,350
arms that will reach and grab and grab my thing.

2395
02:32:53,790 --> 02:32:54,430
Grab it!

2396
02:32:54,650 --> 02:32:55,310
Grab it!

2397
02:32:55,770 --> 02:32:56,010
No!

2398
02:32:58,270 --> 02:32:59,070
Toreba!

2399
02:33:04,150 --> 02:33:04,610
Grab it!

2400
02:33:04,610 --> 02:33:05,150
Toreba machine.

2401
02:33:06,070 --> 02:33:08,110
Toreba machine, I please and beg of you.

2402
02:33:09,050 --> 02:33:11,350
I please and beg of you, please.

2403
02:33:15,670 --> 02:33:16,590
Toreba machine.

2404
02:33:23,350 --> 02:33:26,110
Wait, so am I centering it or am I staying to the left?

2405
02:33:26,170 --> 02:33:26,750
I'm confused.

2406
02:33:28,630 --> 02:33:31,150
So I center it instead of staying to the left?

2407
02:33:31,210 --> 02:33:31,750
I'm confused.

2408
02:33:38,010 --> 02:33:38,890
Oh.

2409
02:33:40,290 --> 02:33:41,170
Tetris.

2410
02:33:45,570 --> 02:33:46,450
Okay.

2411
02:33:47,650 --> 02:33:48,190
Alright.

2412
02:33:49,090 --> 02:33:51,010
Toreba, be a good boy.

2413
02:33:51,810 --> 02:33:54,330
It literally doesn't do anything.

2414
02:33:55,170 --> 02:33:56,310
It's such a scam.

2415
02:33:56,650 --> 02:33:58,350
It literally just tickles it.

2416
02:34:01,290 --> 02:34:02,910
It's so annoying.

2417
02:34:05,550 --> 02:34:07,150
Oh my gosh.

2418
02:34:08,270 --> 02:34:11,490
Got any metal gears inside that claw mechanism?

2419
02:34:13,710 --> 02:34:15,390
Oh my gosh.

2420
02:34:16,490 --> 02:34:18,670
I don't think the arms have enough strength.

2421
02:34:18,910 --> 02:34:19,590
Centering what?

2422
02:34:19,730 --> 02:34:20,390
What does that mean?

2423
02:34:23,570 --> 02:34:24,030
Oops.

2424
02:34:27,410 --> 02:34:29,150
Like centering in here?

2425
02:34:29,670 --> 02:34:30,310
Like this?

2426
02:34:35,020 --> 02:34:37,740
I wasn't exactly centering my...

2427
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:45,280
Oh please staff, come here.

2428
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:49,520
I think it's stuck for real.

2429
02:34:50,120 --> 02:34:51,400
I think it's stuck for real.

2430
02:34:52,580 --> 02:34:54,420
No matter what I do, it doesn't touch.

2431
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:55,420
It doesn't do anything.

2432
02:34:57,100 --> 02:34:58,820
I don't think it budges anymore.

2433
02:35:00,440 --> 02:35:01,760
I think it's stuck.

2434
02:35:02,420 --> 02:35:03,440
Staff, help!

2435
02:35:04,160 --> 02:35:04,640
Help!

2436
02:35:06,200 --> 02:35:07,900
Everybody spam the cat!

2437
02:35:11,300 --> 02:35:15,640
In the first camera, align the vertical part of the right claw with the right corner.

2438
02:35:16,740 --> 02:35:17,460
This here?

2439
02:35:19,240 --> 02:35:21,980
Then in the second, aim for the corner sticking up.

2440
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:25,720
Yeah?

2441
02:35:25,880 --> 02:35:26,320
Okay, I'll try.

2442
02:35:28,440 --> 02:35:29,660
Wait, which corner?

2443
02:35:29,780 --> 02:35:30,560
This one or this one?

2444
02:35:30,680 --> 02:35:31,220
Oh no!

2445
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:39,140
Right most corner.

2446
02:35:40,940 --> 02:35:43,260
Oh shoot, sorry there was lag.

2447
02:35:45,720 --> 02:35:47,380
Sorry there was lag.

2448
02:35:51,750 --> 02:35:53,170
That was good.

2449
02:35:54,590 --> 02:35:56,450
It twitched.

2450
02:36:01,330 --> 02:36:02,370
Help!

2451
02:36:03,350 --> 02:36:04,830
Someone, staff!

2452
02:36:06,350 --> 02:36:07,270
Start.

2453
02:36:10,190 --> 02:36:14,270
1, 2, 3 That's not so bad.

2454
02:36:18,370 --> 02:36:18,610
Okay.

2455
02:36:22,110 --> 02:36:22,650
Okay.

2456
02:36:24,410 --> 02:36:25,810
It's too heavy.

2457
02:36:26,310 --> 02:36:28,110
These claws are so weak.

2458
02:36:28,750 --> 02:36:30,810
These claws are way too weak, man.

2459
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:33,510
This one sucks.

2460
02:36:33,590 --> 02:36:34,390
I miss the balls.

2461
02:36:34,490 --> 02:36:35,810
I miss the takoyaki balls.

2462
02:36:40,270 --> 02:36:40,910
Gosh!

2463
02:36:47,080 --> 02:36:49,160
Oh, I was not far over enough.

2464
02:36:49,420 --> 02:36:49,900
Not bad.

2465
02:37:03,320 --> 02:37:04,120
You guys!

2466
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:04,560
You guys!

2467
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:05,260
You guys!

2468
02:37:09,940 --> 02:37:11,460
Oh my god!

2469
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:12,280
Oh my god!

2470
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:12,640
Oh my god!

2471
02:37:12,660 --> 02:37:13,440
Oh my god!

2472
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:15,180
What do I do now?

2473
02:37:17,320 --> 02:37:18,660
Now lift from the front?

2474
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:19,260
From here?

2475
02:37:21,420 --> 02:37:22,520
From right here?

2476
02:37:24,940 --> 02:37:28,880
It's still kind of...almost there.

2477
02:37:30,100 --> 02:37:31,440
Lift up from here.

2478
02:37:34,140 --> 02:37:36,580
Can I...should I...

2479
02:37:37,100 --> 02:37:40,420
My grandpa used to have one of those.

2480
02:37:47,070 --> 02:37:48,190
Okay, come on.

2481
02:37:48,890 --> 02:37:49,510
Come on.

2482
02:37:50,150 --> 02:37:50,990
Come on!

2483
02:37:51,470 --> 02:37:51,970
Tumbler D!

2484
02:37:53,370 --> 02:37:54,170
Oh, so close.

2485
02:37:55,250 --> 02:37:56,230
So close, so close.

2486
02:37:56,490 --> 02:37:58,070
Maybe a little closer to the front bar.

2487
02:37:59,170 --> 02:38:00,430
Yeah, the background chatter is on loop.

2488
02:38:00,490 --> 02:38:03,870
I'm going to turn it off actually because I'm kind of sick of hearing it.

2489
02:38:07,710 --> 02:38:08,690
It's just noisy.

2490
02:38:09,510 --> 02:38:11,030
Oh my gosh, I can hear again.

2491
02:38:14,250 --> 02:38:15,330
I can hear again.

2492
02:38:19,030 --> 02:38:20,490
What about his grandpa?

2493
02:38:20,810 --> 02:38:21,430
We'll never know.

2494
02:38:27,340 --> 02:38:29,200
I was not...

2495
02:38:33,240 --> 02:38:36,580
The lag in this is so stinky.

2496
02:38:37,140 --> 02:38:38,420
It gets me every time.

2497
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:48,610
1, 2, 3, stop.

2498
02:38:50,770 --> 02:38:52,870
1, 2, stop.

2499
02:39:01,270 --> 02:39:01,910
No!

2500
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:03,470
It's diagonal again!

2501
02:39:09,930 --> 02:39:11,050
It's good?

2502
02:39:11,490 --> 02:39:12,710
Is this really good?

2503
02:39:14,210 --> 02:39:16,550
But it's diagonal again.

2504
02:39:19,390 --> 02:39:20,030
Guys,

2505
02:39:29,560 --> 02:39:30,800
I can't stab it.

2506
02:39:30,880 --> 02:39:33,200
Look, it won't fall through the back.

2507
02:39:33,260 --> 02:39:33,880
It won't.

2508
02:39:34,460 --> 02:39:36,440
I don't think stabbing the butt will work.

2509
02:39:36,520 --> 02:39:37,860
I really don't think so.

2510
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:43,940
I don't think stabbing the back will work.

2511
02:39:45,620 --> 02:39:46,800
I think it's too weak.

2512
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:50,340
I think it's too weak.

2513
02:40:06,290 --> 02:40:07,230
Please!

2514
02:40:08,430 --> 02:40:08,990
Please!

2515
02:40:11,050 --> 02:40:12,890
What the hell?

2516
02:40:15,150 --> 02:40:17,550
It doesn't even move!

2517
02:40:20,370 --> 02:40:22,890
It doesn't even move!

2518
02:40:23,850 --> 02:40:25,330
Oh my gosh.

2519
02:40:29,450 --> 02:40:31,530
It's so...

2520
02:40:38,480 --> 02:40:39,520
Does

2521
02:40:47,320 --> 02:40:49,380
it say assist available?

2522
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:51,020
I thought it did.

2523
02:40:52,700 --> 02:40:54,040
Zero, one.

2524
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:02,880
Line up the inner part of the claw.

2525
02:41:03,140 --> 02:41:04,700
It gets leverage on the package.

2526
02:41:07,820 --> 02:41:09,220
Be the claw.

2527
02:41:12,520 --> 02:41:13,820
You can make it 1, 1.

2528
02:41:14,020 --> 02:41:14,560
I could.

2529
02:41:16,140 --> 02:41:16,820
I could.

2530
02:41:18,860 --> 02:41:21,640
I feel like the people working here are such masochists.

2531
02:41:23,500 --> 02:41:24,560
Oh man.

2532
02:41:34,050 --> 02:41:35,650
I had so much hope.

2533
02:41:36,310 --> 02:41:37,910
And now I lost all of it.

2534
02:41:39,410 --> 02:41:40,490
Oh wait, say this.

2535
02:41:40,610 --> 02:41:40,850
Yeah.

2536
02:41:41,090 --> 02:41:41,990
Not masochist.

2537
02:41:42,210 --> 02:41:43,710
It doesn't do anything.

2538
02:41:46,450 --> 02:41:48,050
Yeah, I meant say this.

2539
02:41:48,290 --> 02:41:48,530
Sorry.

2540
02:41:50,230 --> 02:41:51,770
It doesn't do anything.

2541
02:41:56,270 --> 02:41:57,950
I give up.

2542
02:41:57,950 --> 02:41:59,970
I think I give up.

2543
02:42:01,770 --> 02:42:05,010
Maybe I go back to the balls.

2544
02:42:18,850 --> 02:42:20,530
I wanted to end on a win.

2545
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:37,960
Let's see how it's looking.

2546
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:38,740
It's in use.

2547
02:42:40,480 --> 02:42:42,260
Oh my gosh.

2548
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:43,540
I

2549
02:42:48,270 --> 02:42:49,370
always like this.

2550
02:42:53,110 --> 02:42:56,110
Oh my god, why is it always like this?

2551
02:42:56,110 --> 02:42:58,050
Did they have the two balls?

2552
02:42:58,330 --> 02:42:58,950
Oh damn.

2553
02:43:00,790 --> 02:43:02,470
Another lost soul.

2554
02:43:08,420 --> 02:43:11,520
At least with the balls it feels like I might win eventually.

2555
02:43:13,020 --> 02:43:14,360
Unlike with this.

2556
02:43:14,880 --> 02:43:16,260
Unlike with the other one.

2557
02:43:16,500 --> 02:43:20,040
I feel so... My spirit is so down.

2558
02:43:20,620 --> 02:43:22,260
Even though we won 3 out of 4.

2559
02:43:22,260 --> 02:43:22,500
3 out of 4.

2560
02:43:31,300 --> 02:43:32,100
I tried.

2561
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:33,080
I did try.

2562
02:43:51,420 --> 02:43:53,440
I wanna... Should I get in line?

2563
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:54,860
I want them to clear it though.

2564
02:44:02,830 --> 02:44:04,430
I want them to clear it though.

2565
02:44:05,310 --> 02:44:06,610
Yeah, I'm really tired.

2566
02:44:06,750 --> 02:44:08,310
Sorry, I've had a migraine all day.

2567
02:44:08,510 --> 02:44:10,190
I don't know if it's a migraine.

2568
02:44:10,310 --> 02:44:12,070
It doesn't feel like my normal migraines.

2569
02:44:12,070 --> 02:44:14,910
Just had a headache all day, so...

2570
02:44:14,910 --> 02:44:15,730
I had fun.

2571
02:44:15,990 --> 02:44:18,510
I'm just kind of...

2572
02:44:21,220 --> 02:44:23,700
You can play the takoyaki general prize ones?

2573
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:24,280
Oh, that's true.

2574
02:44:24,480 --> 02:44:24,880
You're right.

2575
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:35,500
I like the background in this one.

2576
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:37,100
It's so cool.

2577
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:38,500
Let's see.

2578
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:40,400
Takoyaki.

2579
02:44:41,560 --> 02:44:42,040
Takoyakis.

2580
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:44,980
Oh, wait, where are all the takoyaki?

2581
02:44:45,340 --> 02:44:48,640
Where are all the takoyakis?

2582
02:44:50,760 --> 02:44:51,220
Huh?

2583
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:55,820
Wait, they took away the takoyakis.

2584
02:44:56,480 --> 02:44:57,320
Where are they?

2585
02:45:01,480 --> 02:45:02,680
I already changed it.

2586
02:45:02,840 --> 02:45:03,940
Where are the takoyakis?

2587
02:45:04,140 --> 02:45:04,300
Huh?

2588
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:13,580
No.

2589
02:45:14,660 --> 02:45:16,420
Where's the takoyakis?

2590
02:45:17,460 --> 02:45:17,960
No!

2591
02:45:24,740 --> 02:45:26,440
Is Osaka one really easy?

2592
02:45:26,740 --> 02:45:28,280
I doubted it for some reason.

2593
02:45:28,680 --> 02:45:29,660
For some reason, I doubted.

2594
02:45:31,280 --> 02:45:32,040
Oh, no.

2595
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:33,560
I don't think this is easy at all.

2596
02:45:36,620 --> 02:45:38,640
He's probably made of steel.

2597
02:45:39,620 --> 02:45:40,500
304 is good.

2598
02:45:40,560 --> 02:45:41,860
Hope your head feels better.

2599
02:45:41,980 --> 02:45:42,620
Thank you.

2600
02:45:44,840 --> 02:45:45,400
Yeah.

2601
02:45:46,360 --> 02:45:47,660
Sorry if I'm like...

2602
02:45:48,460 --> 02:45:51,840
You know, low energy past couple of days.

2603
02:45:52,100 --> 02:45:53,700
Just haven't been feeling well.

2604
02:46:00,250 --> 02:46:01,390
Where are they?

2605
02:46:03,890 --> 02:46:04,350
Refresh.

2606
02:46:07,070 --> 02:46:08,150
Oh, there's one.

2607
02:46:08,250 --> 02:46:08,710
There's one.

2608
02:46:08,770 --> 02:46:09,530
Okay, okay, okay.

2609
02:46:09,990 --> 02:46:10,850
Oh, my goodness.

2610
02:46:11,010 --> 02:46:11,670
It's scaring me.

2611
02:46:12,870 --> 02:46:13,810
We have no takoyakis.

2612
02:46:14,590 --> 02:46:16,390
I'm scared though, because...

2613
02:46:17,150 --> 02:46:19,350
This one looks like it's easy to pop out.

2614
02:46:21,790 --> 02:46:22,710
And also...

2615
02:46:22,710 --> 02:46:24,170
What if I don't grab a ball?

2616
02:46:24,370 --> 02:46:25,270
Okay, I'm gonna try it once.

2617
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:34,440
Where's the crane?

2618
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:35,220
Hello?

2619
02:46:35,220 --> 02:46:37,380
Oh, there it is.

2620
02:46:37,460 --> 02:46:37,860
Oh, my gosh.

2621
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:39,060
Why is it all the way back there?

2622
02:46:45,530 --> 02:46:46,830
This one is so violent.

2623
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:51,360
This one is terrible.

2624
02:46:57,660 --> 02:46:59,400
This one is so terrible.

2625
02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:02,280
No balls.

2626
02:47:03,640 --> 02:47:05,320
My real reaction.

2627
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:08,880
My real reaction.

2628
02:47:13,560 --> 02:47:15,800
This one robs me so many times.

2629
02:47:16,560 --> 02:47:17,340
Oh, no.

2630
02:47:17,640 --> 02:47:18,480
Let's try a different one.

2631
02:47:18,980 --> 02:47:20,480
Yeah, I'm leaving this one.

2632
02:47:20,920 --> 02:47:22,280
Nobody wants to play this one.

2633
02:47:22,380 --> 02:47:23,580
Nobody is waiting for this one.

2634
02:47:24,780 --> 02:47:25,760
Get me out of here.

2635
02:47:26,580 --> 02:47:28,400
Back to the...

2636
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:30,580
It sent me home.

2637
02:47:39,650 --> 02:47:41,330
Just won that previous one?

2638
02:47:41,470 --> 02:47:41,690
What?

2639
02:47:42,730 --> 02:47:43,450
This one?

2640
02:47:43,890 --> 02:47:44,710
Oh, you did.

2641
02:47:44,810 --> 02:47:45,530
It seems like it.

2642
02:47:45,570 --> 02:47:46,050
Good job.

2643
02:47:48,350 --> 02:47:49,870
Thanks for your help though, Ayu.

2644
02:47:50,330 --> 02:47:51,590
I hope you enjoy your Tumblr.

2645
02:47:54,670 --> 02:47:57,470
Please, if you are trying to win these for me...

2646
02:47:59,810 --> 02:48:00,290
No!

2647
02:48:00,710 --> 02:48:02,110
I'm getting them my own.

2648
02:48:02,430 --> 02:48:03,090
It's okay.

2649
02:48:03,510 --> 02:48:05,490
If you win, it's yours.

2650
02:48:05,610 --> 02:48:06,070
It's yours.

2651
02:48:06,210 --> 02:48:07,530
Please don't give it to me.

2652
02:48:07,730 --> 02:48:08,410
It's yours.

2653
02:48:08,510 --> 02:48:08,950
It's yours.

2654
02:48:09,030 --> 02:48:09,510
It's yours.

2655
02:48:09,870 --> 02:48:10,750
You earned it.

2656
02:48:11,830 --> 02:48:13,310
Please don't give it to me.

2657
02:48:14,550 --> 02:48:15,450
It's yours.

2658
02:48:18,030 --> 02:48:20,030
I want to win it on my own.

2659
02:48:20,310 --> 02:48:22,170
I want to win it on my own.

2660
02:48:25,860 --> 02:48:27,620
How will they do it?

2661
02:48:27,860 --> 02:48:29,040
How do they put it...

2662
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:30,460
Together though.

2663
02:48:31,520 --> 02:48:32,780
They are putting more bricks in.

2664
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:34,060
They are like, too easy.

2665
02:48:34,440 --> 02:48:35,760
We got to fill it up with bricks.

2666
02:48:44,380 --> 02:48:46,980
I've started to get too many things.

2667
02:48:47,300 --> 02:48:50,340
Sometimes I get multiples of stuff and I'm like...

2668
02:48:50,340 --> 02:48:54,780
My maid cafe isn't so large, so I'm actually running out of space.

2669
02:48:56,100 --> 02:49:07,580
I have several full boxes of fan letters and things.

2670
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:09,920
I'm trying to find a way to scrapbook them.

2671
02:49:10,220 --> 02:49:12,820
And then other gifts that I'm like, I don't know what to...

2672
02:49:12,820 --> 02:49:17,920
I want to put these somewhere, but I have no space to put them anywhere.

2673
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:22,340
So I'm just kind of like...

2674
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:26,660
So please don't send to me.

2675
02:49:28,280 --> 02:49:33,700
I might have to start declining gifts at conventions and stuff.

2676
02:49:33,780 --> 02:49:37,140
Because I appreciate it so much, but I'm so out of room.

2677
02:49:37,560 --> 02:49:38,920
Actually, it's so bad.

2678
02:49:41,420 --> 02:49:43,060
It's actually so bad.

2679
02:49:45,580 --> 02:49:47,200
I have no more space.

2680
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:49,920
Suffering from success, I know.

2681
02:49:50,460 --> 02:49:55,400
And it makes me so sad because I love receiving people's gifts and stuff.

2682
02:49:55,720 --> 02:49:57,940
But I have no more space.

2683
02:49:59,020 --> 02:50:02,880
My place is so messy because I can't put anything anywhere else.

2684
02:50:02,940 --> 02:50:04,280
So I just have boxes everywhere.

2685
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:10,500
Let's see.

2686
02:50:12,100 --> 02:50:13,420
What was this one?

2687
02:50:13,560 --> 02:50:14,240
The 1800.

2688
02:50:22,070 --> 02:50:23,270
It's another...

2689
02:50:23,270 --> 02:50:24,670
It's a different one.

2690
02:50:25,310 --> 02:50:26,330
It's a different...

2691
02:50:27,970 --> 02:50:30,010
This one looks cleaner, maybe.

2692
02:50:30,530 --> 02:50:31,450
Storage unit.

2693
02:50:33,510 --> 02:50:36,790
I can't even fit all my MGS stuff in the...

2694
02:50:36,790 --> 02:50:40,650
I bought a cabinet specifically for displaying Metal Gear stuff.

2695
02:50:40,710 --> 02:50:42,410
And I can't even fit all my stuff in it.

2696
02:50:42,410 --> 02:50:43,670
Oh gosh.

2697
02:50:47,180 --> 02:50:52,360
I sent not gifts, but dollar-dollar bills for you to take to the strip club.

2698
02:50:53,780 --> 02:50:55,040
Thanks there, Crash.

2699
02:50:55,620 --> 02:50:56,180
Let's go!

2700
02:50:56,400 --> 02:50:57,300
Let's try this one.

2701
02:51:05,970 --> 02:51:07,330
Okay, scoop them up!

2702
02:51:07,930 --> 02:51:08,950
Scoop it up!

2703
02:51:09,130 --> 02:51:10,170
Scoop, scoop, scoop!

2704
02:51:10,890 --> 02:51:12,450
Get scooped, little ball!

2705
02:51:12,570 --> 02:51:13,390
Get scooped!

2706
02:51:13,570 --> 02:51:14,290
Oh my gosh.

2707
02:51:14,570 --> 02:51:15,470
It got scooped.

2708
02:51:15,950 --> 02:51:17,850
Let's go right into the red!

2709
02:51:18,090 --> 02:51:19,210
Right into the red hole!

2710
02:51:22,430 --> 02:51:24,150
You guys, this one might be doable!

2711
02:51:25,830 --> 02:51:26,270
Oh my gosh!

2712
02:51:26,410 --> 02:51:26,690
Oh my gosh!

2713
02:51:26,750 --> 02:51:27,090
Oh my gosh!

2714
02:51:27,210 --> 02:51:27,370
Oh my gosh!

2715
02:51:27,490 --> 02:51:27,850
Oh my gosh!

2716
02:51:27,890 --> 02:51:28,270
Oh my gosh!

2717
02:51:28,790 --> 02:51:29,490
Oh my gosh!

2718
02:51:33,790 --> 02:51:34,150
Start.

2719
02:51:40,490 --> 02:51:40,850
Get...

2720
02:51:42,190 --> 02:51:42,550
Scooped!

2721
02:51:42,870 --> 02:51:43,710
Get scooped!

2722
02:51:43,730 --> 02:51:44,650
Get scooped!

2723
02:51:44,910 --> 02:51:45,830
Get scooped!

2724
02:51:46,710 --> 02:51:47,970
It's a little violent sometimes.

2725
02:51:48,170 --> 02:51:48,750
Get scooped!

2726
02:51:48,750 --> 02:51:49,750
Nice, nice, nice!

2727
02:51:50,550 --> 02:51:51,790
Hope restored!

2728
02:51:54,170 --> 02:51:54,610
Please!

2729
02:51:58,670 --> 02:51:59,910
He's dancing.

2730
02:52:00,870 --> 02:52:01,930
Okay, that's fine.

2731
02:52:04,850 --> 02:52:05,690
Get...

2732
02:52:07,530 --> 02:52:07,950
Get...

2733
02:52:08,370 --> 02:52:08,610
Wait.

2734
02:52:09,030 --> 02:52:09,450
Time.

2735
02:52:09,890 --> 02:52:10,250
Start.

2736
02:52:10,390 --> 02:52:12,770
There we go.

2737
02:52:12,770 --> 02:52:13,870
There we go.

2738
02:52:16,850 --> 02:52:18,810
Time for the scoopening!

2739
02:52:19,450 --> 02:52:20,550
The scoop!

2740
02:52:22,270 --> 02:52:23,170
The scoop!

2741
02:52:24,170 --> 02:52:27,030
Oh we almost double scooped.

2742
02:52:27,610 --> 02:52:28,790
Get scooped!

2743
02:52:29,890 --> 02:52:31,190
And drop!

2744
02:52:32,850 --> 02:52:35,830
That one was a clean drop though, honestly.

2745
02:52:37,150 --> 02:52:38,910
That was such a clean drop.

2746
02:52:40,710 --> 02:52:44,110
You guys, I learned today...

2747
02:52:44,110 --> 02:52:47,890
I don't do well with crane games.

2748
02:52:48,770 --> 02:52:50,670
But scoop games...

2749
02:52:50,670 --> 02:52:52,450
I don't mind so much.

2750
02:52:53,930 --> 02:52:55,570
It sounds like squid games.

2751
02:52:56,070 --> 02:52:57,710
But scooping games...

2752
02:52:57,710 --> 02:52:59,910
Scoop games...

2753
02:53:00,430 --> 02:53:01,690
Double scoop!

2754
02:53:02,990 --> 02:53:05,130
You guys, we got the double scoop!

2755
02:53:09,450 --> 02:53:10,330
Oh shoot!

2756
02:53:11,370 --> 02:53:14,710
We got double scooped!

2757
02:53:15,730 --> 02:53:16,610
Holy moly!

2758
02:53:18,550 --> 02:53:20,370
How do we keep getting two balls?

2759
02:53:21,010 --> 02:53:22,490
Two ball mean to let it again.

2760
02:53:22,690 --> 02:53:24,150
I don't know how I keep doing this.

2761
02:53:27,210 --> 02:53:28,770
I don't know how I keep doing...

2762
02:53:28,770 --> 02:53:29,270
Oh shoot.

2763
02:53:29,590 --> 02:53:30,730
I did not mean to go that far.

2764
02:53:35,490 --> 02:53:36,370
Get scooped!

2765
02:53:43,470 --> 02:53:45,370
Right back into that hole.

2766
02:53:47,410 --> 02:53:49,270
She can't keep getting away with this.

2767
02:53:49,690 --> 02:53:50,570
I'm cheating the system.

2768
02:53:50,890 --> 02:53:52,210
I'm double scoop... I'm double dipping.

2769
02:53:53,790 --> 02:53:54,730
I'm double dipping.

2770
02:53:57,450 --> 02:53:59,750
Can you guys move your cats please?

2771
02:54:00,170 --> 02:54:01,410
So I can see.

2772
02:54:03,710 --> 02:54:04,570
There we go.

2773
02:54:05,110 --> 02:54:05,510
I think.

2774
02:54:06,030 --> 02:54:06,270
Maybe?

2775
02:54:10,370 --> 02:54:11,050
A scoop.

2776
02:54:13,370 --> 02:54:14,310
Sticker spam.

2777
02:54:21,030 --> 02:54:21,550
Guys.

2778
02:54:21,550 --> 02:54:23,790
Guys, this feels doable.

2779
02:54:24,030 --> 02:54:24,890
Perhaps, maybe.

2780
02:54:25,670 --> 02:54:26,390
Oh my gosh.

2781
02:54:26,470 --> 02:54:27,010
Oh my gosh.

2782
02:54:27,030 --> 02:54:27,690
Oh my gosh.

2783
02:54:27,750 --> 02:54:28,270
Oh my gosh.

2784
02:54:28,290 --> 02:54:29,090
So close!

2785
02:54:30,350 --> 02:54:31,450
We're gonna get him!

2786
02:54:35,660 --> 02:54:37,740
We're gonna get Tumblr D!

2787
02:54:40,800 --> 02:54:42,440
I am on Tumblr D, right?

2788
02:54:42,760 --> 02:54:43,380
OK, good.

2789
02:54:43,720 --> 02:54:44,620
Oh my goodness, violence.

2790
02:54:45,780 --> 02:54:47,660
What if I like dump out everything?

2791
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:50,560
Are you winning, Minto?

2792
02:54:50,560 --> 02:54:54,980
I don't know.

2793
02:54:55,020 --> 02:54:55,620
I don't know.

2794
02:54:56,020 --> 02:54:57,340
Am I winning, you guys?

2795
02:54:58,620 --> 02:54:59,420
Am I winning?

2796
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:02,520
Tumblr D.

2797
02:55:04,820 --> 02:55:06,400
Yeah, I am.

2798
02:55:12,140 --> 02:55:13,320
You're a winner to me.

2799
02:55:14,160 --> 02:55:14,680
Thanks.

2800
02:55:16,620 --> 02:55:18,020
You're winning at life?

2801
02:55:18,080 --> 02:55:18,600
I'm dead.

2802
02:55:18,900 --> 02:55:19,800
I'm winning at afterlife.

2803
02:55:20,840 --> 02:55:21,260
Maybe.

2804
02:55:28,250 --> 02:55:32,290
I did at least do one crane game that I successfully got.

2805
02:55:32,690 --> 02:55:35,030
So, I think that's a win.

2806
02:55:35,490 --> 02:55:35,930
You know?

2807
02:55:36,270 --> 02:55:37,730
We did one crane game.

2808
02:55:37,970 --> 02:55:38,570
Oh my goodness.

2809
02:55:39,290 --> 02:55:40,910
Am I gonna have to pay for this one again?

2810
02:55:45,670 --> 02:55:47,890
Do balls count as crane game?

2811
02:55:54,310 --> 02:55:55,350
Get scooped.

2812
02:55:56,590 --> 02:55:57,670
Get scooped.

2813
02:56:00,550 --> 02:56:01,750
A win is a win.

2814
02:56:11,870 --> 02:56:12,290
Guys,

2815
02:56:15,670 --> 02:56:16,390
I don't know.

2816
02:56:16,470 --> 02:56:18,170
I'm starting to feel...

2817
02:56:19,270 --> 02:56:21,770
I'm starting to feel a little bit bad about this one.

2818
02:56:25,940 --> 02:56:28,540
I'm starting to feel a little bit bad about this one.

2819
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:33,760
Get scooped.

2820
02:56:34,320 --> 02:56:36,800
I like to do that to my cat, Pies.

2821
02:56:36,920 --> 02:56:38,720
I like to grab her and I'm like scoop.

2822
02:56:39,160 --> 02:56:42,240
Because she hates being held.

2823
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:44,640
So, I call it her getting scooped.

2824
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:46,560
And I'm like scoop.

2825
02:56:48,900 --> 02:56:50,440
You need a double scooper.

2826
02:56:50,620 --> 02:56:51,100
I do.

2827
02:56:52,140 --> 02:56:53,100
Oh gosh.

2828
02:56:53,220 --> 02:56:55,900
Guys, I was hopeful at first.

2829
02:56:56,820 --> 02:56:58,200
I'm not so hopeful anymore.

2830
02:57:06,460 --> 02:57:07,460
Scoop.

2831
02:57:07,460 --> 02:57:09,340
It must come sometime to jam today.

2832
02:57:13,320 --> 02:57:14,160
Scoop.

2833
02:57:23,080 --> 02:57:25,560
It's creating a snowman.

2834
02:57:27,140 --> 02:57:27,560
No!

2835
02:57:28,620 --> 02:57:30,920
I'm creating a snowman.

2836
02:57:30,920 --> 02:57:31,380
No!

2837
02:57:35,140 --> 02:57:37,660
I'm just creating a snowman.

2838
02:57:37,820 --> 02:57:40,780
Do you wanna build a snowman?

2839
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:47,780
Let's make a snowman.

2840
02:57:52,420 --> 02:57:54,990
Thanks for the encouragement, cats.

2841
02:58:01,900 --> 02:58:03,360
Recreating Mt.

2842
02:58:03,420 --> 02:58:03,780
Fuji.

2843
02:58:07,830 --> 02:58:08,980
Guys, this is it.

2844
02:58:10,180 --> 02:58:12,100
I don't think this is it.

2845
02:58:15,680 --> 02:58:16,960
I think...

2846
02:58:18,340 --> 02:58:24,660
Oh my goodness.

2847
02:58:33,900 --> 02:58:37,800
How far will they stack before it tumbles down?

2848
02:58:38,140 --> 02:58:39,600
We need to make a lot of noise.

2849
02:58:39,700 --> 02:58:41,040
When will the avalanche happen?

2850
02:58:54,220 --> 02:58:55,740
What do I do?

2851
02:58:58,900 --> 02:59:00,520
Do I buy more?

2852
02:59:03,900 --> 02:59:05,340
Do I buy more?

2853
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:14,780
Can't end on a loss.

2854
02:59:15,100 --> 02:59:15,440
OK!

2855
02:59:17,560 --> 02:59:18,440
OK!

2856
02:59:19,560 --> 02:59:21,820
I'm glad I don't pay for gacha games.

2857
02:59:33,080 --> 02:59:35,420
Oh god, please.

2858
02:59:35,420 --> 02:59:35,780
Please!

2859
02:59:48,940 --> 02:59:51,460
Oh we got it.

2860
02:59:54,900 --> 02:59:56,100
OK, I'm not gonna cry.

2861
02:59:57,500 --> 02:59:59,080
But my eyes will still be watering.

2862
03:00:05,040 --> 03:00:05,560
At

2863
03:00:14,800 --> 03:00:17,300
least I get the ball with this one.

2864
03:00:28,910 --> 03:00:29,790
It bounced!

2865
03:00:29,930 --> 03:00:30,270
It bounced!

2866
03:00:30,410 --> 03:00:31,190
We can keep going!

2867
03:00:31,250 --> 03:00:31,850
We can keep going!

2868
03:00:35,680 --> 03:00:38,640
I'm buying this next time I have my card for sure.

2869
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:43,260
The rugs and the plushies.

2870
03:00:43,600 --> 03:00:46,040
Hell no, I'm not putting myself through this hell again.

2871
03:00:47,980 --> 03:00:51,900
A lot of balls in this machine.

2872
03:00:53,120 --> 03:00:53,800
The

2873
03:01:00,640 --> 03:01:01,320
avalanche.

2874
03:01:01,840 --> 03:01:03,600
The collapse of society.

2875
03:01:05,260 --> 03:01:07,480
The collapse of society.

2876
03:01:09,080 --> 03:01:10,720
They will refill it?

2877
03:01:10,760 --> 03:01:11,160
Really?

2878
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:12,280
OK.

2879
03:01:19,820 --> 03:01:22,520
I spent another 20 dollars for these points.

2880
03:01:23,420 --> 03:01:24,880
In case you're curious.

2881
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:28,360
If you're like how much was the points she bought worth?

2882
03:01:28,720 --> 03:01:29,900
It was 20 dollars.

2883
03:01:30,660 --> 03:01:33,680
Oh my god!

2884
03:01:44,560 --> 03:01:47,120
Let me keep going.

2885
03:01:47,920 --> 03:01:49,180
Fuji grows.

2886
03:01:49,420 --> 03:01:50,760
The society is rebuilt.

2887
03:01:52,120 --> 03:01:54,180
We rebuild society.

2888
03:01:56,120 --> 03:01:58,260
Oh my gosh, I want to like shake my monitor.

2889
03:02:03,040 --> 03:02:03,740
Triple!

2890
03:02:05,700 --> 03:02:06,280
No...

2891
03:02:06,280 --> 03:02:08,820
Oh my gosh!

2892
03:02:08,840 --> 03:02:09,980
We almost had a triple!

2893
03:02:11,280 --> 03:02:12,760
The dang thing shook!

2894
03:02:13,780 --> 03:02:15,440
We had three balls!

2895
03:02:16,220 --> 03:02:17,940
I can't believe it!

2896
03:02:18,520 --> 03:02:19,760
I can't believe it!

2897
03:02:24,700 --> 03:02:27,700
Did we lose one or did they both go back into the thing?

2898
03:02:27,800 --> 03:02:28,180
I wonder.

2899
03:02:32,300 --> 03:02:35,020
We were robbed of the three balls.

2900
03:02:37,580 --> 03:02:39,420
I thought we had another three.

2901
03:02:42,220 --> 03:02:43,760
Try not moving up so high.

2902
03:02:43,880 --> 03:02:44,380
What do you mean?

2903
03:02:45,680 --> 03:02:47,140
Oh my gosh!

2904
03:02:47,900 --> 03:02:48,960
It's starting to roll.

2905
03:02:49,740 --> 03:02:51,060
I don't control this part.

2906
03:02:51,220 --> 03:02:53,140
I can only control when I grab the balls.

2907
03:02:54,640 --> 03:02:56,800
I can't control anything else.

2908
03:02:57,340 --> 03:02:58,200
Where it drops.

2909
03:02:58,280 --> 03:03:00,340
I can only control how it grabs the balls.

2910
03:03:04,420 --> 03:03:09,060
Yeah, otherwise I would definitely not be placing it where it goes.

2911
03:03:17,210 --> 03:03:18,790
Why do you have to shake?

2912
03:03:18,910 --> 03:03:21,210
We had double balls!

2913
03:03:25,680 --> 03:03:28,540
I can only control when I grab the balls.

2914
03:03:30,820 --> 03:03:32,980
We're gonna run out of balls at this point.

2915
03:03:38,030 --> 03:03:42,050
Surely Toreba would see this and be like, oh yeah, our game is a little unfair.

2916
03:03:43,590 --> 03:03:45,010
Like Vulcan and Ivan.

2917
03:03:46,710 --> 03:03:47,190
Absolutely...

2918
03:03:47,190 --> 03:03:47,970
We have a double?

2919
03:03:48,530 --> 03:03:50,490
Oh my gosh, it looks like I'm grabbing tits.

2920
03:03:51,490 --> 03:03:51,970
Go!

2921
03:03:52,090 --> 03:03:53,310
B-Release!

2922
03:03:53,470 --> 03:03:54,290
Free the tits!

2923
03:03:56,990 --> 03:03:57,950
So close!

2924
03:03:58,250 --> 03:03:58,910
Oh my gosh.

2925
03:04:00,610 --> 03:04:02,270
It's like I grabbed two little birds.

2926
03:04:03,230 --> 03:04:05,090
You know the birds called the tits?

2927
03:04:16,950 --> 03:04:18,050
We know the birds.

2928
03:04:18,610 --> 03:04:19,630
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

2929
03:04:21,710 --> 03:04:23,330
Oh my gosh, it's so aggressive.

2930
03:04:25,230 --> 03:04:26,430
It's so aggressive.

2931
03:04:27,830 --> 03:04:28,970
Guys, I don't know.

2932
03:04:32,570 --> 03:04:35,470
You can win by flipping the wok.

2933
03:04:40,050 --> 03:04:41,670
Can you actually, I wonder.

2934
03:04:49,620 --> 03:04:51,320
We're gonna run out of balls.

2935
03:05:00,500 --> 03:05:01,220
Please!

2936
03:05:01,900 --> 03:05:04,220
I look like an insane person right now.

2937
03:05:04,400 --> 03:05:07,820
I think the thing is broken!

2938
03:05:10,720 --> 03:05:12,060
Wait, no balls left?

2939
03:05:12,120 --> 03:05:13,040
You win a prize?

2940
03:05:13,820 --> 03:05:15,300
No, I don't think that's true.

2941
03:05:15,700 --> 03:05:17,960
I think it only is if you...

2942
03:05:17,960 --> 03:05:21,880
You win the prize of being a pathetic, sad, sad person.

2943
03:05:22,200 --> 03:05:24,240
Who couldn't even fill up a hole.

2944
03:05:26,220 --> 03:05:28,720
When you have this many balls.

2945
03:05:32,770 --> 03:05:33,070
Please!

2946
03:05:35,150 --> 03:05:37,730
Wait, rules say zero balls equals a win?

2947
03:05:42,300 --> 03:05:43,480
So close!

2948
03:05:45,480 --> 03:05:46,700
271, wow.

2949
03:05:47,500 --> 03:05:48,480
It's on the back wall.

2950
03:05:49,840 --> 03:05:51,260
How can you read that?

2951
03:05:51,640 --> 03:05:52,480
I only see...

2952
03:05:55,120 --> 03:05:58,480
I only see it saying about the...

2953
03:05:59,920 --> 03:06:02,140
About it going into the red.

2954
03:06:04,540 --> 03:06:07,520
Win the prize when there are zero ping pong...

2955
03:06:08,840 --> 03:06:09,840
I see!

2956
03:06:16,300 --> 03:06:17,700
It's the two cameras.

2957
03:06:17,960 --> 03:06:18,680
Oh, my bad.

2958
03:06:20,020 --> 03:06:20,940
Here we go.

2959
03:06:21,300 --> 03:06:22,280
I guess we'll win.

2960
03:06:22,460 --> 03:06:23,760
Oh wait, I have to buy more.

2961
03:06:29,540 --> 03:06:31,720
Guys, this is the last one.

2962
03:06:35,080 --> 03:06:37,060
Before I have to buy more.

2963
03:06:38,240 --> 03:06:40,000
The gacha pity reel.

2964
03:06:40,420 --> 03:06:43,300
I hope

2965
03:06:46,970 --> 03:06:47,670
I get a ball.

2966
03:06:48,650 --> 03:06:49,950
What if I don't get one?

2967
03:06:52,090 --> 03:06:53,790
That was so close.

2968
03:06:54,150 --> 03:06:55,530
That was so close.

2969
03:06:56,150 --> 03:06:57,510
It's starting to get really aggressive.

2970
03:06:57,690 --> 03:06:59,850
It's starting to get angry at me for trying so hard.

2971
03:07:13,570 --> 03:07:15,650
It's starting to get so jumpy.

2972
03:07:20,030 --> 03:07:21,630
10 more dollars, ok.

2973
03:07:22,010 --> 03:07:23,170
Do 10 more dollars.

2974
03:07:31,990 --> 03:07:34,030
I don't know what's more pathetic.

2975
03:07:34,030 --> 03:07:35,730
The crane game or this?

2976
03:07:38,210 --> 03:07:39,830
I don't know what's more pathetic.

2977
03:07:40,910 --> 03:07:41,590
I don't know.

2978
03:07:42,130 --> 03:07:43,670
Will I even feel good about winning this?

2979
03:07:43,690 --> 03:07:44,470
I have no idea.

2980
03:07:46,290 --> 03:07:47,490
In the end...

2981
03:07:47,970 --> 03:07:51,750
In the end, when it's all said and done, will I even feel good about this?

2982
03:07:52,310 --> 03:07:53,170
Who knows?

2983
03:07:53,850 --> 03:07:55,390
I feel like, oh yeah.

2984
03:07:56,230 --> 03:07:57,710
I earned it myself.

2985
03:08:06,350 --> 03:08:07,650
Get that tumbler.

2986
03:08:07,910 --> 03:08:08,770
Let's go!

2987
03:08:25,570 --> 03:08:26,330
One more.

2988
03:08:26,430 --> 03:08:28,210
Hold on, I'm going to check my bank account real quick.

2989
03:08:36,100 --> 03:08:36,800
One second.

2990
03:08:47,370 --> 03:08:49,210
Hold on, let me add the calculator.

2991
03:09:35,480 --> 03:09:36,240
The timer.

2992
03:09:46,530 --> 03:09:47,230
I'm ok.

2993
03:09:48,650 --> 03:09:49,830
At least, you know what?

2994
03:09:50,070 --> 03:09:52,790
I'm getting physical items and not JPEGs.

2995
03:09:52,790 --> 03:09:56,170
So honestly, maybe I am winning.

2996
03:09:56,490 --> 03:10:00,290
Some people spend this money and then their favorite game goes out of service.

2997
03:10:06,830 --> 03:10:07,470
Sometimes...

2998
03:10:07,470 --> 03:10:11,710
Sometimes people spend this money and then their favorite game goes out of service.

2999
03:10:16,590 --> 03:10:18,050
Speak your truth.

3000
03:10:18,790 --> 03:10:19,190
Yeah!

3001
03:10:20,010 --> 03:10:20,590
Remember

3002
03:10:26,470 --> 03:10:27,230
this prize.

3003
03:10:27,390 --> 03:10:28,510
Remember this feeling.

3004
03:10:29,030 --> 03:10:33,070
This feeling of...

3005
03:10:37,720 --> 03:10:38,300
Absolute...

3006
03:10:39,360 --> 03:10:44,210
Please, I need closure for the tumblers.

3007
03:10:46,130 --> 03:10:46,970
Thank you.

3008
03:10:47,150 --> 03:10:48,190
Sounds pretty dire.

3009
03:10:48,270 --> 03:10:53,450
We have four more that we need to get and then we will have the prize in our hands.

3010
03:10:54,410 --> 03:10:56,630
But not by...

3011
03:10:56,630 --> 03:10:58,030
Not by luck.

3012
03:10:58,530 --> 03:11:00,010
But by...

3013
03:11:00,010 --> 03:11:01,210
By pity.

3014
03:11:01,530 --> 03:11:02,370
Literal pity.

3015
03:11:03,730 --> 03:11:09,250
How can I... How is that ending on...

3016
03:11:10,070 --> 03:11:11,750
How is that ending on a win?

3017
03:11:11,830 --> 03:11:12,910
I don't even know.

3018
03:11:14,670 --> 03:11:15,610
Oh my god.

3019
03:11:20,700 --> 03:11:21,860
We take those.

3020
03:11:21,940 --> 03:11:23,300
We take those!

3021
03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:24,160
Not pity.

3022
03:11:24,300 --> 03:11:24,960
Determination.

3023
03:11:25,320 --> 03:11:25,680
Yeah!

3024
03:11:26,120 --> 03:11:27,020
Not pity!

3025
03:11:27,740 --> 03:11:28,460
Determination!

3026
03:11:28,460 --> 03:11:28,640
Determination!

3027
03:11:29,240 --> 03:11:29,560
Yeah!

3028
03:11:31,620 --> 03:11:34,920
The PNGs play video games and sometimes reads what I said.

3029
03:11:35,480 --> 03:11:36,380
Wait a second.

3030
03:11:37,500 --> 03:11:38,300
Have I the gacha?

3031
03:11:43,760 --> 03:11:46,440
I bet the staff member is watching this right now.

3032
03:11:47,280 --> 03:11:47,920
Oh my god!

3033
03:11:48,060 --> 03:11:48,700
Oh my god!

3034
03:11:49,260 --> 03:11:51,080
Stop being so aggressive please!

3035
03:11:54,710 --> 03:11:55,470
Please...

3036
03:12:04,600 --> 03:12:06,700
Don't feed the gambling problem.

3037
03:12:06,900 --> 03:12:07,940
This is not...

3038
03:12:07,940 --> 03:12:09,980
This is... The gambling...

3039
03:12:09,980 --> 03:12:10,760
This is... No.

3040
03:12:11,040 --> 03:12:13,020
I will never...

3041
03:12:14,080 --> 03:12:19,000
I don't have a problem because I'm not feeling the high.

3042
03:12:19,960 --> 03:12:23,380
I'm just feeling... I'm feeling every low possible.

3043
03:12:24,720 --> 03:12:26,000
Two balls!

3044
03:12:26,780 --> 03:12:27,760
Oh my gosh!

3045
03:12:27,760 --> 03:12:28,660
We still grabbed it.

3046
03:12:29,700 --> 03:12:31,880
I'm feeling every low possible.

3047
03:12:32,260 --> 03:12:35,820
I don't feel like... I'm feeling the gambling high baby!

3048
03:12:39,280 --> 03:12:42,240
I'm feeling all the lows right now.

3049
03:12:42,940 --> 03:12:43,760
This is it.

3050
03:12:43,800 --> 03:12:44,840
The final boss.

3051
03:12:45,860 --> 03:12:47,280
I have to buy more.

3052
03:12:50,980 --> 03:12:52,400
I have to buy more.

3053
03:13:07,690 --> 03:13:10,010
My friend is rubbing it in my face.

3054
03:13:11,950 --> 03:13:14,990
They're like, I paid $20 for two tumblers.

3055
03:13:15,150 --> 03:13:16,230
How much did you spend?

3056
03:13:25,200 --> 03:13:27,580
I'm gonna cry myself to sleep tonight.

3057
03:13:33,990 --> 03:13:35,570
Why am I such a loser?

3058
03:13:46,880 --> 03:13:47,980
First try.

3059
03:13:47,980 --> 03:13:51,020
Oh my gosh, I even bought extra just in case.

3060
03:13:52,300 --> 03:13:53,300
That's it!

3061
03:13:53,460 --> 03:13:55,520
There's no more balls!

3062
03:13:56,160 --> 03:13:57,700
Give me my prize!

3063
03:14:24,250 --> 03:14:25,650
They were watching.

3064
03:14:26,710 --> 03:14:29,970
The staff was literally watching and was laughing at my pain.

3065
03:14:33,270 --> 03:14:36,390
They were like, she's gonna run out eventually.

3066
03:14:54,520 --> 03:14:57,640
This is disgracing that thing clean right now.

3067
03:14:58,560 --> 03:14:59,840
It pisses me off.

3068
03:15:01,840 --> 03:15:03,700
It pisses me off!

3069
03:15:12,940 --> 03:15:15,630
I have literal tears running down my face.

3070
03:15:17,190 --> 03:15:18,470
Oh my god.

3071
03:15:22,870 --> 03:15:24,510
There they are!

3072
03:15:28,570 --> 03:15:31,190
A, B, C, D!

3073
03:15:31,990 --> 03:15:34,850
Good job entertaining people who weren't even watching the stream.

3074
03:15:35,050 --> 03:15:36,090
That's my Yoshi.

3075
03:15:37,670 --> 03:15:40,590
They're like, oh brother, this guy stinks!

3076
03:15:43,730 --> 03:15:45,890
Congrats on getting 4 for 4!

3077
03:15:47,050 --> 03:15:47,930
Thank you!

3078
03:15:47,930 --> 03:15:48,270
Thank you!

3079
03:15:52,690 --> 03:15:55,030
My luck, everybody.

3080
03:15:55,330 --> 03:15:56,130
My luck.

3081
03:15:58,070 --> 03:15:59,270
At least with the balls.

3082
03:16:00,050 --> 03:16:00,650
Golly.

3083
03:16:01,510 --> 03:16:02,390
Laughing at me.

3084
03:16:03,130 --> 03:16:04,570
Money well spent.

3085
03:16:04,950 --> 03:16:08,470
I can't wait for the plushies and the carpet or the little rugs to come out.

3086
03:16:08,830 --> 03:16:10,930
I can't wait to happily go to Mercari.

3087
03:16:12,590 --> 03:16:16,650
I can't wait to happily go to Mercari and click buy.

3088
03:16:16,650 --> 03:16:20,890
And the price will probably be like 3000 yen.

3089
03:16:21,010 --> 03:16:21,930
And I'm like, perfect.

3090
03:16:26,070 --> 03:16:27,590
How much did I spend?

3091
03:16:32,560 --> 03:16:35,940
I spent... I love Metal Gear so much.

3092
03:16:38,240 --> 03:16:42,820
I really wanted to buy a Metal Gear Solid 4 poster.

3093
03:16:44,020 --> 03:16:45,880
But I don't think I will now.

3094
03:16:48,880 --> 03:16:51,020
I still have to pay for my game.

3095
03:16:52,020 --> 03:16:54,500
That's really gonna make me go broke.

3096
03:16:59,260 --> 03:17:00,020
But...

3097
03:17:02,620 --> 03:17:04,440
I spent $300.

3098
03:17:24,050 --> 03:17:24,810
So...

3099
03:17:24,810 --> 03:17:26,810
This was a choice.

3100
03:17:27,450 --> 03:17:29,790
A financial choice of my own doing.

3101
03:17:31,530 --> 03:17:31,710
I

3102
03:17:35,190 --> 03:17:36,850
have some regrets.

3103
03:17:37,730 --> 03:17:41,310
But boy golly, it's gonna feel good when that comes in the mail.

3104
03:17:44,090 --> 03:17:46,890
What if you release merch to make back some money?

3105
03:17:49,090 --> 03:17:50,050
Thank you!

3106
03:17:50,950 --> 03:17:55,750
Yeah, I should probably contact the people that are supposed to be releasing my merch.

3107
03:17:55,750 --> 03:17:58,750
Because that all came out of pocket too.

3108
03:17:59,370 --> 03:18:02,090
And so, I haven't made any of that.

3109
03:18:02,250 --> 03:18:03,990
I had to put all that up front.

3110
03:18:08,690 --> 03:18:09,290
So...

3111
03:18:09,290 --> 03:18:11,450
Financial decisions.

3112
03:18:16,290 --> 03:18:17,690
Sell your own tumblers.

3113
03:18:18,170 --> 03:18:18,670
No!

3114
03:18:20,030 --> 03:18:20,630
What?

3115
03:18:21,590 --> 03:18:22,610
Sell them?

3116
03:18:22,790 --> 03:18:24,250
They are literally being...

3117
03:18:24,250 --> 03:18:26,550
Well, I would say they are being buried with me.

3118
03:18:26,550 --> 03:18:29,710
I'm going to exhume my body and I'm going to bury...

3119
03:18:29,710 --> 03:18:32,410
I'm going to put those tumblers in my fucking grave.

3120
03:18:32,790 --> 03:18:33,830
Excuse me?

3121
03:18:44,430 --> 03:18:44,990
Tumblers.

3122
03:18:45,930 --> 03:18:47,490
Why did you say...

3123
03:18:49,170 --> 03:18:52,470
I'm gonna make everybody experience this.

3124
03:18:53,490 --> 03:18:54,810
This is how you get...

3125
03:18:54,810 --> 03:18:56,550
You have to play these games too.

3126
03:18:56,670 --> 03:18:58,210
To win the minto tumblers.

3127
03:19:05,470 --> 03:19:08,710
Oh my gosh, I was even looking at new mics today too.

3128
03:19:10,930 --> 03:19:11,410
Okay.

3129
03:19:12,470 --> 03:19:14,670
I'm gonna go eat indomie for dinner.

3130
03:19:17,390 --> 03:19:19,030
And for the rest of the week too.

3131
03:19:19,890 --> 03:19:21,750
Orion, welcome to Babusha, thank you.

3132
03:19:22,930 --> 03:19:25,310
Nah, all jokes aside, I'm doing fine.

3133
03:19:25,410 --> 03:19:27,090
So don't feel like you have to donate or anything.

3134
03:19:28,230 --> 03:19:28,750
It's okay.

3135
03:19:29,130 --> 03:19:29,850
I'm all good.

3136
03:19:30,210 --> 03:19:31,110
This wasn't good fun.

3137
03:19:31,370 --> 03:19:34,130
Like I said, I don't spend money on gacha games or anything.

3138
03:19:34,130 --> 03:19:36,350
So this kind of felt like...

3139
03:19:36,350 --> 03:19:39,210
Like the real gacha person experience.

3140
03:19:41,130 --> 03:19:42,690
How do you do it?

3141
03:19:44,330 --> 03:19:46,030
Minto tumblers would be so cute.

3142
03:19:48,010 --> 03:19:50,570
I'd buy one to enjoy...

3143
03:19:50,570 --> 03:19:51,650
My mornings with Minto.

3144
03:19:54,410 --> 03:19:54,970
Raitido!

3145
03:19:55,930 --> 03:19:57,330
Congrats on the tumblers, Minto.

3146
03:19:57,550 --> 03:19:58,950
You'll always be a winner to me.

3147
03:19:59,630 --> 03:20:00,270
Thank you!

3148
03:20:01,870 --> 03:20:04,310
I don't even want to check the group chat right now.

3149
03:20:04,610 --> 03:20:06,250
It has 9 plus messages.

3150
03:20:14,490 --> 03:20:18,030
Unrelated to what you spent today, I just want to reward you for an entertaining stream.

3151
03:20:18,910 --> 03:20:19,850
I'm glad you had fun.

3152
03:20:19,930 --> 03:20:21,950
If you had fun at my suffering...

3153
03:20:24,290 --> 03:20:25,950
If you had fun at my suffering...

3154
03:20:26,750 --> 03:20:27,430
That's okay.

3155
03:20:27,430 --> 03:20:28,390
You know what?

3156
03:20:28,430 --> 03:20:30,110
That's why I'm a streamer.

3157
03:20:33,210 --> 03:20:35,050
Never back down, never what?

3158
03:20:35,510 --> 03:20:37,290
Never back down, never what?

3159
03:20:40,590 --> 03:20:41,910
New equipment incoming.

3160
03:20:41,990 --> 03:20:42,930
How's your mic hunt going?

3161
03:21:25,450 --> 03:21:25,970
Played

3162
03:21:48,940 --> 03:21:49,680
the crane games too.

3163
03:21:49,740 --> 03:21:52,300
Won a Crayola Shark plushie and Marvel Chibi Heroes.

3164
03:21:52,660 --> 03:21:57,380
You know, there's probably some people who spend just as much as me...

3165
03:21:57,380 --> 03:21:59,940
On the plushies at round 1, probably.

3166
03:22:00,180 --> 03:22:00,520
You know?

3167
03:22:00,920 --> 03:22:02,080
What's so good about it?

3168
03:22:02,080 --> 03:22:02,840
Stop it!

3169
03:22:03,620 --> 03:22:04,420
Thank you!

3170
03:22:06,340 --> 03:22:07,840
Thank you so much.

3171
03:22:27,200 --> 03:22:29,300
Congrats, thank you.

3172
03:22:29,680 --> 03:22:30,600
Please stop.

3173
03:22:30,940 --> 03:22:32,960
You've said too much today already, please.

3174
03:22:43,690 --> 03:22:44,650
Thank you!

3175
03:22:50,820 --> 03:22:51,300
Okay.

3176
03:22:51,620 --> 03:22:53,100
Well, thank you guys for all the encouragement.

3177
03:22:53,340 --> 03:22:55,960
Thank you for everybody who tried to even help me...

3178
03:22:57,140 --> 03:22:58,100
With the...

3179
03:22:58,100 --> 03:23:00,180
With the... What's it called?

3180
03:23:00,460 --> 03:23:01,320
The crane game.

3181
03:23:01,420 --> 03:23:02,580
You guys tried really hard.

3182
03:23:02,980 --> 03:23:04,140
I really appreciate it.

3183
03:23:04,200 --> 03:23:05,500
Thank you guys so much.

3184
03:23:05,880 --> 03:23:10,400
Thank you guys for enabling me to do these stupid streams.

3185
03:23:10,540 --> 03:23:13,780
I don't like doing them very much because it's just...

3186
03:23:13,780 --> 03:23:17,140
I feel of course it's like a waste of your money.

3187
03:23:17,260 --> 03:23:18,720
Especially if it's like...

3188
03:23:18,720 --> 03:23:20,800
If it's...

3189
03:23:20,800 --> 03:23:24,860
Like luck based with the balls, you know?

3190
03:23:27,180 --> 03:23:29,780
But I really appreciate it...

3191
03:23:30,440 --> 03:23:33,100
For you guys helping me out and encouraging me.

3192
03:23:33,340 --> 03:23:34,160
Thank you!

3193
03:23:35,380 --> 03:23:36,700
Thank you, thank you.

3194
03:23:50,550 --> 03:23:51,850
I'm not gonna get caught.
