1
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,850
Guys?

2
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:01,930
Guys?

3
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,490
Some, like, kaiju show is on TV.

4
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,790
Can't stop watching.

5
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,210
Oh, it's Ultraman!

6
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,650
No, I think this is an Ultraman ad.

7
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,490
Just kidding.

8
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,110
I was gonna say, it's Ultraman!

9
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,570
I'm watching an ad for gummies.

10
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,570
Hello everyone!

11
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,090
Welcome back to UnMetal!

12
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,230
I know I say I don't want to delay too much, because...

13
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,910
You know what, I actually have stuff that I really want to do today.

14
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,890
Because I'm not in Japan for so much longer.

15
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,970
But, there's one thing that I've been wanting to do, and it closes early.

16
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,930
So I've been like, okay, I'm gonna go do it.

17
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,170
Today I'm gonna go do it.

18
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,450
Today I'm gonna go do it.

19
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,270
But I never get to go do it!

20
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,190
So...

21
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,690
Today I'm gonna go do it.

22
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,750
That's why I'm streaming just one hour earlier...

23
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,670
Than how I have been while in Japan.

24
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,450
Oh, it's back on.

25
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,090
The kaiju are fighting.

26
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,490
Is this Ultraman?

27
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,710
There he goes.

28
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,750
I put to the cube in the slot and twist and turns it.

29
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,910
Oh my god, Henshi...

30
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,470
Oh my god!

31
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:50,730
Oh my god, he's in the middle of the kaiju!

32
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,270
Oh, he's thrown down!

33
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,790
Wait, is this the Ultraman that...

34
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,750
Oh my god, this one...

35
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,430
Oh my god, the kaiju just exploded!

36
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,810
He was just walking away!

37
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,590
He was crawling away like...

38
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,970
And then the other one just faded out of existence.

39
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,770
There were two of them and they were fighting.

40
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,830
And then Ultraman came in and like literally did two taps on them.

41
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,690
And then they...

42
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,970
One of them exploded and the other one just literally faded out of existence.

43
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,050
What is he doing now?

44
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:26,670
He's like...

45
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,610
He's still looking around...

46
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,630
Oh my god, he's getting blasted from behind!

47
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,070
What the...

48
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,050
Oh, he's got a shield.

49
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,930
Oh, he's getting blasted from behind again!

50
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,830
By a second force!

51
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,830
Oh my god.

52
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,370
Oh no, Ultraman!

53
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,910
Is this the one that Arcana Project does the song for, I wonder?

54
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,370
There's like...

55
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,830
There's real people problems too.

56
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,710
There's some guy, he's crying and yelling at a girl.

57
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,770
And the girl is also crying and yelling.

58
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,600
He's really...

59
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
I don't have any sound on.

60
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,100
Sorry.

61
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,420
I'm really invested in this.

62
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,280
He's like transforming...

63
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,460
Again?

64
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,880
The cube goes into the slot.

65
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,660
And then he's...

66
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,500
He's turning it!

67
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,100
He's turning it!

68
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,860
Yeah, he's turning it!

69
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,900
Where was that child's drawing?

70
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,380
Oh my god, he's got armor now.

71
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,320
He's got Ultra Armor.

72
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,060
Some creature just woke up.

73
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,180
What is this?

74
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,560
He's coming out of the ground.

75
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,500
Or he's peeking from the ground.

76
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,940
Oh my gosh, Ultraman!

77
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,500
Oh, the guy that faded is actually invisible!

78
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,380
Oh, and they're still attacking him!

79
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,160
But what if that one guy literally exploded though?

80
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,580
Ultraman can take both hits with his arms.

81
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,020
He's got little shields on his arms now.

82
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,640
Oh, there's lots of explosion.

83
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,780
Oh, rip this town.

84
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,900
Oh, the Kaiju are hugging.

85
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,440
They went after him.

86
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,940
And then he like jumped in the air.

87
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,920
Because he was like, haha, too slow.

88
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,640
And then they bumped into each other.

89
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,440
Oh, he just like summoned a sword.

90
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,420
And then...

91
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,420
Oh...

92
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,920
He cut them in half!

93
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,160
And then they exploded into fireworks!

94
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,780
Yeah!

95
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh my gosh, this guy and this girl are still yelling at each other.

96
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,740
Maybe.

97
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,500
Maybe.

98
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,400
Maybe.

99
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,960
She looks... she's smiling now.

100
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,360
I think they're happy that the... that the beasts were destroyed.

101
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,940
And he still looks really upset.

102
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,140
I think he's still crying.

103
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,500
I don't know why.

104
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,500
She's talking to him.

105
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,040
She's calming him down.

106
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,520
Yelling while Kaiju fight.

107
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:24,900
Yeah!

108
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,320
Audio description on.

109
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,100
Oh, she's crying, but she's smiling.

110
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,060
She's just like, yeah, it's okay.

111
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,460
Oh!

112
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,040
Oh!

113
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,180
Ultraman's here, but like...

114
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,500
Not in Ultra.

115
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,540
This is the best way to experience cable TV.

116
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,160
Wait, what time is it?

117
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,720
This is probably over in like...

118
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,200
A couple minutes, right?

119
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,020
Oh my god.

120
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,340
He's walking over to her.

121
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,960
Oh, he's doing that like drive-by talking.

122
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,800
You know, where he like...

123
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,160
Walks over...

124
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,700
You know like what they do in like drama and Japanese drama and stuff?

125
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,620
Where like...

126
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,520
They'll walk over to someone.

127
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,340
And they'll stand next to them.

128
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,560
But they won't look at them.

129
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,240
And then he'll...

130
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,000
They'll say something.

131
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,400
And walk away all serious, you know?

132
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,820
Oh, he just did that.

133
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,580
And she started crying even more.

134
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,520
Oh my god.

135
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,580
She's sobbing.

136
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,600
What did you say to her?

137
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,020
I should turn on the volume.

138
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,100
What did you say to her?

139
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,540
I think he said she hates us.

140
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,160
Wait.

141
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,080
Are they...

142
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,780
That's her teacher.

143
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,320
I think she had a crush on her teacher.

144
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,780
Wait, but she's in a Seifuku and this is definitely college.

145
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,120
Wait.

146
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,300
What's going on?

147
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,860
Wait.

148
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,740
She's in a Seifuku this whole time.

149
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,680
This is like a love montage.

150
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,860
What's going...

151
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,160
But that's a teacher.

152
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:04,860
Oh.

153
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:08,960
Huh?

154
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,740
Is she like a genius?

155
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,280
Maybe she went to school early.

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,480
And she fell in love with her teacher.

157
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,180
Whatever this little robot guy is, I love him so much.

158
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,540
He kind of looks like a Pokemon.

159
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,460
There's like this one beetle Pokemon that's blue.

160
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,500
Looks like her.

161
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,660
Maybe she's cosplaying the whole time.

162
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,840
Yeah, this is a little scandalous.

163
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,040
This is on my...

164
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,260
Children's...

165
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,640
This is like children's prime time TV, you know?

166
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,420
Okay, she's wiping her tears.

167
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,080
She's over it.

168
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,480
She's like, okay.

169
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,880
We have like actual issues.

170
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,640
Like monsters destroying the city.

171
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,500
Oh, she's smiling.

172
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,060
Oh, wait, she's...

173
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,240
She turned around to look at him.

174
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,320
Oh, she knows she's looking at the robot.

175
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,740
And she's smiling at him.

176
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,880
I think she likes him more.

177
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,440
Are you watching Kamen Rider?

178
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,020
I'm watching Ultraman.

179
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,500
I'm watching Ultraman.

180
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
And she's walking away with the robot.

181
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,300
Good end, actually better end.

182
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,740
You know what, maybe she becomes a robot lover.

183
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,000
You know, just like me.

184
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,580
And the robot is showing what happened.

185
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,600
Here's the credits, hold on, I have to listen to the credits.

186
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,910
Yeah, it's Arcana Project, I knew it!

187
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,310
Oh, I love this song.

188
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:53,370
Yeah, it's showing like a montage of her in school, but she's like in a college room.

189
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,470
I think she's in love with her professor.

190
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:19,200
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, listening to my favorite, one of my favorite idol groups while watching kaiju fight is like really surreal, actually.

191
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,920
Unmeddle!

192
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,560
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to exit out of the game.

193
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,980
Create a clone of Mike!

194
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,900
Is this what we were doing?

195
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,520
No.

196
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,540
Wait, huh?

197
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,930
Oh, is that what we were doing?

198
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,610
Oh, clone Mike to fool the cameras.

199
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,590
Yes, okay, I was like, I know.

200
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,130
I know we have to fool the cameras here.

201
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,690
And then, how do I do that?

202
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,230
Just finished, pass VOD and yes.

203
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,430
Thanks for watching the VOD.

204
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,010
Do you think this tree is punchable too?

205
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,970
Now there's anime on the TV.

206
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,350
Oh my God, what is this?

207
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:15,930
It looks so cute.

208
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,750
Tensui no...

209
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,830
What is this?

210
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:21,350
Oh my gosh.

211
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,030
Oh!

212
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,610
Oh, it's the row girl, it's row boats.

213
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,410
Okay, I gotta stop watching TV.

214
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,570
Okay, I gotta stop watching TV.

215
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,970
Okay.

216
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,830
Okay, there's so many cameras around here.

217
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,370
Okay.

218
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,370
Okay, okay, okay.

219
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,610
Probably get his attention with a coin, right?

220
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,310
Oh, we have no, who stole our coins?

221
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:56,530
What?

222
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,410
Did we throw our coins?

223
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,190
Throw our coins away.

224
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,710
No way.

225
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,490
No way.

226
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,850
I had so many coins.

227
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,050
What happened?

228
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,410
I'm not quite sure what to do here.

229
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,330
I didn't give them to the man.

230
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,750
I gave him $10 million.

231
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:18,750
Okay, hold on.

232
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,360
Oh look, I become invisible.

233
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,040
I become invisible.

234
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,920
Wait, you can't see me.

235
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,540
There, I'm invisible.

236
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,040
I'm invisible.

237
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,800
Okay, hold on.

238
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,100
Oh, wait.

239
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,480
He can't be...

240
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
He can't...

241
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,240
Uh oh, wait.

242
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,140
Um...

243
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,280
Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded?

244
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,920
You're contradicting yourself.

245
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,180
Sergeant, execute this liar.

246
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,360
Yes, sir.

247
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,940
Oh my God, they just shot me.

248
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,720
How am I supposed to do this part?

249
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,200
Create a clone of Mike.

250
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,060
Hold on, I'm gonna...

251
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,520
I think our codec...

252
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,300
I think...

253
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:00,700
Jesse here.

254
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:00,960
Oh, my God.

255
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,340
Over.

256
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,280
Yeah, the guy is maybe Dunzo.

257
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,320
Jesse here.

258
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,340
Do you copy?

259
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,500
I hear you.

260
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,940
No, I need...

261
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,140
What?

262
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,940
I need help.

263
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,500
No, that's not...

264
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,490
What else do I have in here?

265
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,650
I have some reeds.

266
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,740
Palm trees.

267
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,200
Um...

268
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,820
Let's see.

269
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,580
Um...

270
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,640
How am I supposed to create?

271
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,960
I created!

272
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,760
What is it?

273
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,020
Tied reeds.

274
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,640
What did I just make?

275
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,460
Do I...

276
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,200
I think I must put his clothes on this thing.

277
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,720
Blair Witch.

278
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,780
For real though, actually.

279
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,880
I think I have to put his clothes on this thing.

280
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,200
Wait, your clothes.

281
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,920
Clothes.

282
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,780
Clothes.

283
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,500
Clothes.

284
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,080
Shit.

285
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,240
Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded?

286
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,840
You're contradicting yourself.

287
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,160
Sergeant, execute this liar.

288
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,640
Chloroform in his head.

289
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,300
Yes, sir.

290
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:47,940
Ooh.

291
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm just trying to voodoo doll you.

292
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,000
Why can't I just take his clothes?

293
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,500
Okay.

294
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,440
Chloroform.

295
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,800
How do I chloroform again?

296
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
You want to try using the chicken hat?

297
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,820
Oh, wait.

298
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,800
Oh.

299
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,260
Um...

300
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:09,860
Combine.

301
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,600
It must be something with this, right?

302
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,280
Probably.

303
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,640
And then...

304
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,020
Oh, shit.

305
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,900
Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded?

306
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,540
You're contradicting yourself.

307
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:25,720
Sergeant...

308
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,640
I got everything you need now.

309
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

310
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,380
Ba-ba-bum.

311
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,240
But once I pass him out...

312
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,760
Combine it with something else, maybe.

313
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,040
I'm trying to use it to, like...

314
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,200
Put the sunglasses.

315
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,240
No.

316
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,200
No.

317
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:00,900
No.

318
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,420
No.

319
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,700
Do you have a different way of doing that?

320
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,380
No.

321
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:04,780
Hey...

322
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,840
No!

323
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,110
I'm trying to figure it out.

324
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:14,930
Yeah.

325
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,180
You can move bodies.

326
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,300
Yeah, but it's, like...

327
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,320
They say if...

328
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,540
If he's not on screen...

329
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,820
I think the alarm still goes off.

330
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,400
Yeah, I see.

331
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,520
Unless I just stand here with him.

332
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,400
Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded?

333
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,400
We just stand here with him.

334
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,800
I mean, that's obviously not the case.

335
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,700
Do I just stand here behind him?

336
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,400
Maybe?

337
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,300
I don't know.

338
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,590
Let me try... when I'm holding him, maybe I press C.

339
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,730
Maybe I press C while I'm holding him, you know?

340
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,910
So let me combine this.

341
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:24,730
And then... select it, and then while we're chloroforming him...

342
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,790
We... hold it.

343
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,710
We hold it, maybe.

344
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,750
C.

345
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,470
C.

346
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,170
C.

347
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:37,830
C.

348
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,430
C.

349
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:38,890
No.

350
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:39,790
Ah!

351
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:40,690
Why?

352
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,670
It didn't work!

353
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,710
It was my B-Day!

354
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,270
Last year, my Kamiyoshi sang Sanchi... Sanchi Pidgey.

355
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,450
But she died.

356
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:58,690
Oh.

357
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,710
Can I ask you for some U-Nya, gay horse?

358
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,570
U-Nya!

359
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,390
U-Nya!

360
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,930
U-Nya!

361
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,950
U-Nya!

362
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,390
Koba, happy birthday!

363
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,610
I don't know what to do here.

364
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,270
Has anyone played this?

365
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,050
Can I get a hint?

366
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,410
I just woke up, and honestly, not feeling so well today, so...

367
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,430
Just mentally.

368
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,950
Not physically.

369
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,510
Just mentally.

370
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,460
What if I... can I... will it see me here?

371
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,720
Yeah.

372
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,180
What the?

373
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,900
There's an exclamation point there!

374
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,080
Oh!

375
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,900
Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded?

376
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,620
Is there a person there?

377
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,680
Behind the tree?

378
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,520
Interesting.

379
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,660
Let me combine this.

380
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,090
And then re-save.

381
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,850
I have played, there's a uniform you can steal somewhere else.

382
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,150
Okay!

383
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:15,930
Thank you!

384
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,550
Find a spare uniform.

385
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:19,150
Okay.

386
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,220
Oh my god.

387
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,320
Go go go go go go!

388
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,980
Maybe here?

389
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,740
Oh wait, how am I supposed to get past the both of them?

390
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,100
Oh, never mind.

391
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,320
Okay, hold on.

392
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,500
Oh my-

393
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,060
Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded?

394
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,300
Great start to the stream, I suppose.

395
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,320
I'm so sorry, guys.

396
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,360
Awww...

397
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:18,410
What?

398
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,310
You, you, you...

399
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,430
Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded?

400
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,350
Oh my god, please shut the hell up.

401
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,050
I don't want to listen to you anymore.

402
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,230
Stupid general guy, whoever.

403
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,710
No!

404
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,570
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

405
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,050
Didn't you say that the alarm never sound?

406
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,750
What?

407
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,310
It's turned!

408
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,430
Didn't you say that the alou- It was looking the other way, are you kidding me?

409
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,350
No way.

410
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:55,290
I'm about to turn off the voices for this guy for real.

411
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,240
Oh my gosh.

412
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,100
Oh my gosh.

413
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,500
Oh my gosh.

414
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,700
Okay.

415
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,500
Okay, okay.

416
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,360
Okay.

417
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,240
Okay.

418
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,460
Okay.

419
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:11,880
Wait.

420
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,280
Wouldn't it be able to...

421
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,960
Maybe here I can do it.

422
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,200
Okay.

423
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,200
Okay.

424
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,720
Uniform!

425
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,320
I got bullets.

426
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,560
I got a uniform!

427
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,120
I got another uniform!

428
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,520
Okay.

429
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,120
Oh, it's saved.

430
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:35,460
It's saved.

431
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:35,780
It's saved.

432
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,080
It's saved.

433
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,320
It's saved.

434
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:36,500
Okay.

435
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,240
Now if I combine...

436
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,940
With our...

437
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,880
We have a guard clone!

438
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,600
And we have...

439
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,440
Two of them!

440
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,020
Yeah!

441
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,760
Even in the dark.

442
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,080
Or from afar.

443
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,200
Looks like a real live guard.

444
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,800
We created a clone.

445
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,200
Real Metal Gear.

446
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,170
Liquid Mike.

447
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,210
Liquid Mike.

448
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,370
Oh my god.

449
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,110
Oh my god.

450
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,330
Oh!

451
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,990
Okay.

452
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,750
Thank goodness the game is a little...

453
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,770
Um...

454
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:24,810
Generous sometimes.

455
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,210
Okay.

456
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:25,810
Shoo!

457
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,190
Shoo!

458
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:26,610
Shoo!

459
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,930
Shoo!

460
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,090
Oh wait.

461
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:29,890
I should have gone.

462
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,610
My bad.

463
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,910
Wait, but now they're looking in like the same direction.

464
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,430
Wait, I can't go.

465
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:37,990
Okay.

466
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,330
Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded?

467
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,410
Hey Minto, I have a question.

468
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,970
Didn't you say the alarm never sounded?

469
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,520
This game...

470
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,100
This game is trying to kill me.

471
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,570
I don't think it can see me.

472
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:04,890
I don't think it can see me here.

473
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,210
Yeah.

474
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,010
Okay.

475
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,310
Okay.

476
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:10,970
Noob!

477
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,170
Contradicting.

478
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,510
I'm just full of contradictions.

479
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,190
Oh my gosh.

480
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:15,370
Go.

481
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,570
Go.

482
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:15,730
Go.

483
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:15,830
Go.

484
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:15,930
Go.

485
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,270
Go.

486
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,290
Go.

487
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:17,310
Go.

488
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,470
Go.

489
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:17,770
Go.

490
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:19,990
Go.

491
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,550
Only guards in the shell core carry AKs.

492
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,230
Oh my gosh.

493
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,790
Oh my gosh.

494
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:27,810
Oh!

495
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,710
We made it!

496
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,210
We made it!

497
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:29,350
Okay.

498
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:29,670
Let's go.

499
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,690
Let's go wash.

500
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:31,390
Let's go wash.

501
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,470
Let's go wash.

502
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,110
Let's go water closet.

503
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,130
Yippee!

504
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,390
Okay.

505
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:42,810
What?

506
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,450
Okay.

507
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:44,570
Okay.

508
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,870
We'll take care of that other room.

509
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,310
Another time.

510
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,160
Oh!

511
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:56,680
Oh!

512
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,460
I forgot to combine.

513
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,380
La la la la.

514
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,220
Oh.

515
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,020
Oh.

516
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,460
La la la la.

517
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,420
La la.

518
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,400
Set up the clown!

519
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,440
Set up the clown!

520
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,400
Shit.

521
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,920
Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded?

522
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,820
Why didn't it?

523
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,060
I think I was robbing him instead.

524
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,400
Okay.

525
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,020
But this is fine.

526
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,800
Because combine.

527
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:24,940
Combine.

528
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,260
Combine.

529
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,620
With this.

530
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,240
And then combine.

531
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,280
And then...

532
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,080
Combine.

533
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,820
Combine.

534
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,220
Combine.

535
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,460
And then...

536
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,640
There we go.

537
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,020
Didn't you say the alarm never sounded?

538
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,040
Didn't you say?

539
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,780
The alarm?

540
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,120
Didn't you say?

541
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,140
Didn't you say the alarm never sounded?

542
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,180
Didn't you say the alarm never sounded?

543
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,400
Set it up!

544
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,020
Didn't you say... the alarm never sounded?

545
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,260
Okay, I'm gonna try and get the medal now.

546
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,940
Time to... time to... time to play God.

547
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,050
Yeah!

548
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,460
I'm gonna go save again.

549
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,200
Didn't you say the alarm never sounded?

550
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:51,020
Oh my gosh, it's an ad for Precunet and ReZero!

551
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,100
I miss Precunet so much.

552
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,100
Pain.

553
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,940
Pain, pain, pain, pain.

554
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,640
Okay.

555
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,460
Actually, since we're right here...

556
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,860
There we go.

557
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,200
Now we won't have to go all the way back to the bathroom.

558
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,230
Shit.

559
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,110
And...

560
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,070
Oh, shit!

561
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,170
It's a two-tap for X, isn't it?

562
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,150
To carry the guys?

563
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,770
Okay, okay.

564
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,400
Okay, okay.

565
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,140
Didn't you say... didn't you say... I said nothing!

566
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,820
I said nothing, I said nothing, I said nothing, I said nothing.

567
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,620
I said nothing, I said nothing, I said nothing...

568
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,380
I said absolutely...

569
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,000
Nothing.

570
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,360
And then...

571
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,000
Got it.

572
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,850
I'm just gonna move him, like, right here.

573
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,270
I'm scared to go, though.

574
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,210
Okay, we'll wait.

575
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,030
We'll wait for it to re-psyc- re- redo its, uh...

576
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,630
There we go.

577
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,050
Okay.

578
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,320
There we go.

579
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,720
Oh!

580
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,080
What's in here?

581
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,080
Wait!

582
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,860
What's in... Grenades!

583
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,520
Electromagnetic grenades!

584
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,600
Wait!

585
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:54,940
Oh no.

586
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,780
We got the chaff grenades.

587
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,880
Chaff's real.

588
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,820
If I use it right here...

589
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,460
Disables any electronic devices for three seconds!

590
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,680
Secret.

591
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,000
Is there a secret in there?

592
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,680
Hold on.

593
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:26,850
The tree.

594
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,900
Here we go.

595
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,660
Very eco-friendly.

596
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,320
I know.

597
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,080
I'm destroying trees.

598
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,780
What happened to you, Jessie?

599
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,900
Jessie, you've changed.

600
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,840
You're destroying trees now.

601
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,560
That was never you!

602
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,500
That was never you!

603
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,020
What about this tree?

604
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,140
No.

605
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,100
Okay, let's go.

606
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,700
Wasn't there a tree here?

607
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,720
There never was a tree.

608
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,520
There never was a tree.

609
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,400
It's all in your imagination.

610
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,420
It's all just... secret.

611
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,900
It's all just...

612
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,680
But there's a guy here.

613
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,680
Up there, isn't there?

614
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,560
It said...

615
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,560
Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded?

616
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,800
You're contrad...

617
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:50,660
Huh?

618
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,020
But it's... what's that three...

619
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,600
Huh?

620
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,180
Oh, I have to, like...

621
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,960
Oh, it's not, like, a general...

622
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,100
Wait, do I have to...

623
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,460
I have to, like, aim it?

624
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,360
Disables any...

625
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,440
I have to, like...

626
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:08,880
Oh!

627
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,540
I thought it was just, like, a...

628
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,860
Spray and pray, like, whatever.

629
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,120
I thought it was, like, a...

630
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,620
You know, I'm used to Metal Gear, you guys.

631
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,780
So I actually have to aim at it.

632
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,760
Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded?

633
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,000
Oh...

634
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,080
Oh...

635
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,240
I'm pretty sure you said...

636
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,260
Oh, I didn't say anything!

637
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,860
I'm not contradicting myself.

638
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,170
That's really short.

639
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,870
That's, like, extremely short.

640
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,530
I couldn't even have time to break the box!

641
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,390
Um...

642
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,050
I didn't even have time to break the box.

643
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:00,690
Okay.

644
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,010
Huh!

645
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,070
Oh, shit.

646
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:03,830
Hahaha!

647
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,560
Didn't you say that the alarm never...

648
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,500
Is that voice line gonna drive you crazy?

649
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:12,940
Yeah.

650
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,720
Actually.

651
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,460
Actually.

652
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,360
Not quite in the mood for it today, but you know?

653
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,700
It's fine.

654
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,200
It's fine.

655
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,160
Everything's okay.

656
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,100
Okay.

657
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,920
Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded?

658
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,500
You're contradicting...

659
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,560
That's how I feel about that.

660
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:52,740
Yeah...

661
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,340
Hahaha.

662
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,920
I wish I could, like, shoot the, um...

663
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,940
The cameras.

664
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,300
If I can disable them...

665
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,200
Why can't I just shoot them dead?

666
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,600
Okay.

667
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,430
Thank you!

668
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,750
Oh, my gosh.

669
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,930
I don't trust myself.

670
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,390
Didn't you say that the alarm never...

671
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:41,390
Wait, after successfully selling my GPU and PS5...

672
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,630
Don't tell me if you're being financially irresponsible.

673
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,830
What are you talking about?

674
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,790
Probably have to roll to get to those crates fast.

675
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,750
Oh, maybe!

676
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,790
Maybe, maybe, maybe I have to...

677
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,990
Look guys, I'm punching you!

678
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,330
Punch chat, punch!

679
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,250
Punch chat!

680
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,510
Punch chat!

681
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,610
Get punched!

682
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,470
Get punched!

683
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:10,990
Get punched!

684
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,210
Get punched!

685
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,650
Get punched!

686
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,440
Sorry, because if there's a guy behind the tree, I'm just kind of trying to guess what to do is all.

687
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,860
Because I see his little exclamation point.

688
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,420
You know, when he sees me.

689
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,460
Maybe I have to shoot him dead.

690
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,960
Maybe I have to shoot him dead.

691
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,580
Maybe I have to blow him up.

692
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,220
Okay.

693
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,840
I'm going to save real quick.

694
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,960
I don't feel like running back and forth, you know?

695
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,940
Just one of those things.

696
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,600
Oh gosh, it didn't work.

697
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,000
Oh, I can stand here though.

698
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,920
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

699
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,080
I can stand there and not be seen.

700
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,580
I thought it had a wider cone.

701
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,540
A wider radius, you know?

702
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,160
Even if I have to do it several times.

703
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,060
Okay, okay, okay.

704
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,020
We made it!

705
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,280
Yippee!

706
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:14,940
Yippee!

707
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,920
Yippee!

708
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,420
Yippee!

709
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,780
Okay, but what do I do about this guy over here?

710
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,300
I'm behind a tree.

711
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,080
I can't reach this one.

712
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,220
Hmm.

713
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,960
No, no, no.

714
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,140
I can't punch the tree either.

715
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,160
What if I shoot the man?

716
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,980
What if I shoot him?

717
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,500
Damn.

718
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,500
Reload.

719
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,790
I'm trying to shoot through the tree.

720
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:08,830
I'm trying to shoot through the tree.

721
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,410
There could be no one there.

722
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,250
There could be no one there.

723
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,290
There could be no one there.

724
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,130
Oh.

725
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,270
Oh.

726
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,870
Why did I always see an exclamation point right here?

727
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,890
Wait, what just happened?

728
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,010
Oh!

729
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,210
What's this?

730
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,250
It wasn't wise to use weapons there.

731
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,070
Oh, okay.

732
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,250
I got more grenades.

733
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,990
I got more grenades.

734
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,450
Stamina!

735
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,310
Destroy it.

736
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,090
Destroy it.

737
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,890
Is there anything I can do in here?

738
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,010
Oh, okay.

739
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,710
A secret room for real?

740
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:54,070
I just knew about it because of the exclamation point.

741
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,510
Oh, then there never was any guy there.

742
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,110
I'm just actually crazy?

743
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,250
Oh, wait.

744
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,250
How do I...

745
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:18,970
I have a key.

746
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,590
I have a key.

747
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,550
I have a key.

748
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,130
No, wait!

749
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,170
This is too difficult!

750
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,950
How am I supposed to...

751
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,570
How am I supposed to get around and down?

752
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,250
Save.

753
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,350
That's a good idea.

754
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,770
That's a good idea.

755
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,570
Wire cutter.

756
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:43,990
Will it work?

757
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,120
Nah, it doesn't work.

758
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,840
That was...

759
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,480
That's really big brain thinking though.

760
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,440
I feel like that should have worked.

761
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,920
Oh!

762
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,580
What the...

763
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,360
Oh, I did Wasta instead of Up.

764
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,900
Okay.

765
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,860
This one is... tricky!

766
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,380
Oh, okay.

767
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,300
Okay, okay, okay.

768
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,400
Okay, I have to do it.

769
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,360
Like from here, I think.

770
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:25,570
Hey!

771
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,320
No.

772
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,360
Wait.

773
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:34,920
Yeah.

774
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,660
There we go.

775
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,480
Okay.

776
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,500
Hey!

777
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,460
Um...

778
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,720
I don't know.

779
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,300
I'm just... I'm just nervous now.

780
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,060
So I'll do it anyway.

781
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,680
What?

782
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,460
What?

783
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,600
Punch.

784
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,860
Punch, punch.

785
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,400
Nice job.

786
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,120
Thank you.

787
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,680
Thank you, thank you.

788
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,260
Okay.

789
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,020
All right.

790
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,720
All right, all right.

791
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,540
All right, all right.

792
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,090
Okay.

793
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,010
Let's save again.

794
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,570
Just save it again, you know.

795
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,530
All right.

796
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,670
Cool.

797
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,690
I only have five left.

798
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,470
There it was.

799
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,770
The entrance to the Omega building.

800
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:52,630
That would be the last place I'd visit on my tour de escape.

801
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,650
Tour de escape.

802
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,810
Enter the door without raising any suspicion.

803
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,070
Oh, it saved for me.

804
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:58,530
Dang it.

805
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,130
No suspicion.

806
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,990
No suspicion will be caused.

807
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,070
Obviously.

808
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,010
Oh.

809
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:09,550
Okay.

810
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,230
I want the trash can.

811
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,170
Pizza box.

812
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:19,310
Wait.

813
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,070
Open up to see what's inside.

814
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:30,190
I carefully studied that pizza box, examining every detail, every clue, every molecule.

815
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:36,150
I deduced that it was used by someone else to smuggle something into the Omega building.

816
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,370
A pizza?

817
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:37,810
A pizza.

818
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:38,350
A pizza.

819
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:38,610
Exactly.

820
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,050
A pepperoni pizza to be precise.

821
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:41,470
A pizza.

822
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,830
A financially responsible wisp.

823
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:47,850
Thanks for being such a supportive and amazing goshi.

824
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,410
If I hold it...

825
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,630
I carefully studied that pizza box.

826
00:43:58,650 --> 00:43:58,830
Oh, oh.

827
00:43:58,830 --> 00:43:58,870
My bad.

828
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,810
If I hold it, then maybe I can also get in.

829
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,450
Right?

830
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,620
Punch.

831
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:10,680
Punch.

832
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,480
Punch.

833
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:19,130
Punch.

834
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,910
I carefully studied that pizza box, examining every detail, every clue, every molecule.

835
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:22,950
No.

836
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,270
I keep pressing the wrong thing.

837
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:24,750
Okay.

838
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,390
I got an extinguisher.

839
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,570
I can't use it, though.

840
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,330
Can I combine?

841
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:40,590
Combine.

842
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,290
I have a smoking pizza!

843
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,790
Oh my gosh.

844
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:46,850
I have...

845
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:51,710
I was so hungry that I ate the pepperoni bits left over on the cardboard.

846
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:52,010
Ew.

847
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:52,850
But I'm not hungry.

848
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,950
But as I opened the box, the steam from within disappeared.

849
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:57,270
Oh.

850
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:58,370
Pepperoni.

851
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:58,690
Okay.

852
00:44:58,690 --> 00:44:58,970
Hold on.

853
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,190
Then we have to combine it again.

854
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:00,990
Okay.

855
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:04,490
Now we have a hot smoking fresh pizza.

856
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:05,610
Right?

857
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:06,650
Yes.

858
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:08,690
Pizza delivery!

859
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:09,630
Pizza!

860
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,170
Pizza delivery!

861
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,310
Pizza delivery!

862
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:24,590
Ooh.

863
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,090
That was close.

864
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,150
Pizza!

865
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:29,310
Pizza delivery!

866
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,510
Pizza delivery!

867
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:40,010
If I just go, will it work?

868
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,830
Or do I have to...

869
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,250
Do I...

870
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,350
Um...

871
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,310
Do I have to disable it?

872
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,790
It could just...

873
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:55,490
Potentially just work.

874
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:55,850
Ah!

875
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,050
It's P!

876
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:04,350
Pizza!

877
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:05,830
Pizza!

878
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,470
Mike!

879
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,550
Oh.

880
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:18,830
P!

881
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:23,910
Yeah.

882
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,370
I show you the pizza.

883
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,050
I show you the... look at that.

884
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,390
Steaming.

885
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,270
Pepperoni!

886
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:39,030
Pepperoni!

887
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:44,870
He liked it!

888
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:45,350
He liked it!

889
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:45,790
He liked it!

890
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:47,890
Arugula.

891
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:50,290
Yippee!

892
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:53,150
Perfect!

893
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,850
You guys perfect stage.

894
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,150
Look at us.

895
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:01,930
Chapter 9.

896
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,370
Jericho's heart.

897
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:08,870
As I crossed the door, I entered into the Omega Building.

898
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,610
The heart of Operation Jericho.

899
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:12,810
The Omegaverse.

900
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:16,170
It was a cold, dark, industrial place.

901
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,670
Perfect.

902
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,930
With containers and barrels everywhere.

903
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:25,970
On my right, there was the control room where they monitored the outer cameras.

904
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,650
And, of course...

905
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,290
The asshole that controlled them.

906
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:31,970
Oh, I was gonna say there's nobody in there.

907
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:33,790
The guy I tricked with the pizza.

908
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,550
Who was coming over to get it.

909
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:38,590
Reality was going to hit him in the face.

910
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,590
Quite literally.

911
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,070
Give me the fucking pizza and get out.

912
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:45,170
Don't be rude!

913
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:46,490
You are, friend.

914
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,430
I'm not your friend, buddy.

915
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,850
What the fuck?

916
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,310
It doesn't weigh shit.

917
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,870
Son of a bitch.

918
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:54,850
Punch him!

919
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,110
Kill him!

920
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:58,790
It's empty.

921
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,310
Where the hell is my pizza?

922
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,110
Look at what's on the box.

923
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:03,330
What's on the box?

924
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:04,290
Where?

925
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:09,390
I was inside the Omega Building.

926
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:12,150
I just had to reach the rooftop and pray that I'd find a helicopter.

927
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,650
I was hoping he would do like the fist through the...

928
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:16,430
The fist through the...

929
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,130
Through the box.

930
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,950
I'm glad that he did not disappoint.

931
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,490
I'm so glad.

932
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,130
Nothing.

933
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:25,390
I'm gonna destroy these, though.

934
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,990
As I destroyed that computer.

935
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:27,090
I'm so glad.

936
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:30,010
I saw something curious inside its metal guts.

937
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:30,650
Metal guts?

938
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:34,910
It was a thick cable and a sign that said, Ground Floor Alarm Cable.

939
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:35,910
Do not cut.

940
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:36,870
I can cut that.

941
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,070
Cut the alarm.

942
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:39,310
Okay, cut that.

943
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:39,970
I can cut that.

944
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:41,970
Done.

945
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,830
With the cable cut, the alarm wouldn't be triggered on this floor.

946
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:50,470
Even if I was detected, guards wouldn't be able to trigger the alarm.

947
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,030
Yeah, baby!

948
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,730
I'm destroying everything here!

949
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:02,330
Kill the lights!

950
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:08,590
Wait, so, do I not have to be stealthy anymore, or...?

951
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:11,690
They put a lot of effort into the security of that compound.

952
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:12,270
Yeah?

953
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:15,310
The guards weren't the typical ones I've encountered before.

954
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:15,610
Oh, no.

955
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:16,170
They were monkeys!

956
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:16,530
They were.

957
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,270
Oh.

958
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:19,530
Scandinavian!

959
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:22,550
Exterminators?

960
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,010
Like a bug exterminator?

961
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:26,190
Or...

962
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,440
They were Scandinavians!

963
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,320
I'm scared.

964
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,480
What if I do exterminator?

965
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,680
Let's do...

966
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,140
Um...

967
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:40,960
Scandinavian.

968
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,800
Scandinavian guards.

969
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,040
Oh!

970
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,700
Not only were they tougher than normal guards, they were light sleepers, too.

971
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,780
No, do they wake up?

972
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,820
Is he gonna wake up eventually?

973
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:05,980
Do they wake back?

974
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:06,800
Oh!

975
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,220
Ow!

976
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:08,880
Ow!

977
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:10,680
Oh, shoot.

978
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,100
Uh...

979
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,000
You can use string to tie up a Scandinavian guard before they wake up.

980
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:15,760
Oh!

981
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,500
I don't have any, though!

982
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,520
And I'm bleeding out.

983
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:24,180
I used all my string on the stupid Blair Witch Project.

984
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,360
Um...

985
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:27,640
Let's...

986
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:29,660
Ouch!

987
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,180
Ouch!

988
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:30,740
Ouch!

989
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:31,380
Ouch!

990
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,140
Ouch!

991
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:32,520
Ouch!

992
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:32,900
I'm in a loop.

993
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,600
I'm in a loop.

994
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,080
I'm in a loop.

995
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:36,520
I'm in a loop.

996
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:36,740
I'm in a loop.

997
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,000
I'm in a loop.

998
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:37,860
Oops!

999
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:38,940
I fell asleep.

1000
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,340
Oops!

1001
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,420
I fell asleep.

1002
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,660
This is so stupid.

1003
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,100
Noooo!

1004
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,140
Oops!

1005
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:45,900
I fell asleep.

1006
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:46,820
Oops!

1007
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,640
I fell asleep.

1008
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,140
Okay.

1009
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,080
Oh, they're just chilling where they are at, though.

1010
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:58,840
Maybe it's okay.

1011
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:03,410
Okay?

1012
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:06,710
Oops!

1013
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:07,610
Oops, I fell asleep.

1014
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:10,310
Oops, I fell asleep.

1015
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,190
Come on, look this way.

1016
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,070
There we go.

1017
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,490
Oh my gosh, we leveled up!

1018
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:28,990
It could be demolition, man!

1019
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:32,550
Grenades and rockets deal 25% more damage, or...

1020
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,610
Actually, you recover health slowly when not bleeding!

1021
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,030
Wait, that's huge!

1022
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:40,890
That's huge!

1023
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,870
I want to take out those other guys.

1024
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:04,130
Hi.

1025
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:13,850
What's in here?

1026
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:15,550
Oh!

1027
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:18,530
Lots of rope!

1028
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,720
There's a little freaky in here.

1029
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,140
A little freaky indeed.

1030
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:27,980
A little freaky indeed!

1031
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,680
Mint's a fan of Shibari.

1032
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:39,600
I didn't spend my formative years reading Nanotakaru for nothing.

1033
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,360
In class!

1034
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:47,860
You know.

1035
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,940
You know how it is.

1036
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,980
What's on this side?

1037
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,620
I can probably...

1038
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,440
Oh wait, but they're like both looking this way, aren't they?

1039
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,200
Elemental evil sadistic laugh.

1040
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,560
In class!

1041
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,200
I do not know...

1042
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,580
how it is.

1043
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,480
That's okay.

1044
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,680
Wait, how am I supposed to go to...

1045
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,300
Shit.

1046
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:16,680
I'm a prisoner!

1047
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,560
Sit back down.

1048
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:17,940
No!

1049
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:19,700
Wait!

1050
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,440
Wait!

1051
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:22,640
Oh.

1052
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:23,780
Um.

1053
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:27,960
Actually,

1054
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:31,940
this is okay.

1055
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:37,020
And the reason I say it's okay is because we learn about the string.

1056
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,480
So, all I do...

1057
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,960
All I got to do is get the string.

1058
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,380
They put a lot of effort into...

1059
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,720
Scandinavian guards.

1060
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,760
Okay.

1061
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,400
The string is up above.

1062
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,380
So what we can do is...

1063
00:53:59,220 --> 00:53:59,840
Do this.

1064
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,280
And then...

1065
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:06,840
Wait.

1066
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,500
Oh shit.

1067
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,720
Like so.

1068
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,540
Right?

1069
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,200
Right?

1070
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:15,880
Ah!

1071
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:16,780
Ah!

1072
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:25,160
See on me.

1073
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,480
And then...

1074
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,140
See on you.

1075
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,540
I mean...

1076
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,720
Wait.

1077
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:32,900
No!

1078
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,620
Why didn't it work?

1079
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:38,780
There we go.

1080
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,180
Okay.

1081
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:39,920
Okay.

1082
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,880
We're fine.

1083
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,000
Oh.

1084
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,700
I just gotta level up.

1085
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,920
See on me.

1086
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:47,740
See on you.

1087
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:49,500
Okay.

1088
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,120
We're fine.

1089
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,080
Everything's all good.

1090
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:51,660
See?

1091
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,640
I made it work.

1092
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,240
In the end, I got it to work.

1093
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:03,230
Okay.

1094
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:03,910
And then...

1095
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:04,770
Select.

1096
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:05,530
And then...

1097
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:06,150
See.

1098
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:08,170
Yeah!

1099
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:08,730
Yeah, yeah.

1100
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,070
Oh no, I didn't level up though.

1101
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:13,110
No!

1102
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:14,750
I need to become Action Hero!

1103
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:17,250
Alright.

1104
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,680
Let's re-get the stuff that I just lost.

1105
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,740
Alright.

1106
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,580
We're all good.

1107
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:26,840
Yeah.

1108
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,680
I missed the star this time.

1109
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,260
So sad.

1110
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,000
This looks suspicious.

1111
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:35,800
We'll come back.

1112
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,780
Ignore the blood.

1113
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,920
Water closet.

1114
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,580
Yippee!

1115
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,180
Okay.

1116
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,500
And break everything.

1117
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,200
Can't let them be happy.

1118
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,560
Okay.

1119
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:00,780
Oh.

1120
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,680
And it's...

1121
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:02,900
Okay.

1122
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:03,240
I have two.

1123
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,800
It's an elevator.

1124
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:06,460
Okay.

1125
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,240
What's over here?

1126
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,140
I know there's two guys here.

1127
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,680
Interesting.

1128
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:14,780
Oh.

1129
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,240
I need a...

1130
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,220
Card four.

1131
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,780
Level four card key.

1132
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,400
This guy is just wandering around.

1133
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,320
I don't have any... anything to distract these guys anymore.

1134
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:35,800
Hmm.

1135
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:36,660
Hmm.

1136
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,240
Hmm.

1137
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:43,320
I wonder if I should also start blasting...

1138
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:43,700
Hahaha!

1139
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,480
Would a gun do better than my fists?

1140
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,080
Would a gun do better than my fists?

1141
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,960
Can you knock on the wall?

1142
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,720
I don't think so.

1143
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,160
No.

1144
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:09,090
Perfect!

1145
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:13,410
Action hero!

1146
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:15,110
There we go.

1147
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:17,490
I truly am an action hero.

1148
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:18,690
With that, that was...

1149
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,390
That was pretty action-y, I'll be honest.

1150
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,910
And I'm hel- Look, I'm gaining health!

1151
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:26,570
I'm gaining health!

1152
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:27,930
Oh, this is so good.

1153
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:32,730
Wait, he's like looking straight at me.

1154
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:33,870
Now that I think about it.

1155
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:35,770
How do I want to go about this?

1156
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:38,790
Oh!

1157
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:43,980
Oh my god.

1158
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:44,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1159
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,280
We're okay!

1160
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,320
Did I tie him up?

1161
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,280
Yeah, I tied him up.

1162
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,980
Yeah, he's all tied up.

1163
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:03,560
Little room.

1164
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,160
I found a few crates.

1165
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:05,840
A few crates.

1166
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,260
Okay.

1167
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:07,900
They contained.

1168
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:08,920
They contained!

1169
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:10,620
Um...

1170
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,870
I don't know what I need the most of.

1171
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:17,730
Rockets, maybe?

1172
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,390
Why do I need rockets right now, though?

1173
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:22,530
Rockets.

1174
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:28,150
I have, um... I have five first aid kits.

1175
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:29,590
I only have one rocket.

1176
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,780
I can't even hold them.

1177
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,540
Are you kidding me?

1178
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,580
I can only hold two rockets at a time.

1179
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:56,890
This guy...

1180
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:57,950
I have one rope.

1181
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,080
Give me a...

1182
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,720
Oh, I wish one of the options was rope.

1183
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:20,800
Metal!

1184
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,040
Yeah, more rope!

1185
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,060
Yeah, more rope.

1186
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,360
Yay!

1187
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,660
Yo, yo, yo!

1188
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,620
Okay, nice.

1189
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,960
We can hear your keypad.

1190
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:37,660
Good.

1191
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:39,940
Oh, oh.

1192
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:40,900
Oh, oh, oh.

1193
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,760
Is this guy gonna be looking straight at me?

1194
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,960
Actually, I'm gonna save real quick.

1195
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:49,820
Just in case.

1196
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,370
I have no fear with the rope!

1197
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:04,970
When I have rope, I have no fear.

1198
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:07,330
More of these.

1199
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,290
I wonder what we'll need them for.

1200
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:15,950
I love attacking.

1201
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:20,670
What's this here?

1202
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:25,750
I was the only one without a triangle!

1203
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:31,010
Secret blood bag.

1204
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:32,410
Oh.

1205
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:34,890
Lots of bullets.

1206
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,350
Okay, let's take it.

1207
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:38,610
I don't know what the blood bag's for.

1208
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:40,030
It's kinda scary.

1209
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,690
Fills your HP more instantly!

1210
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,890
Nice.

1211
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:48,570
Let's go!

1212
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:50,890
Secret!

1213
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:54,470
Oh, this is this room.

1214
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:57,870
I guess let's just go.

1215
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,070
For it?

1216
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:06,190
More rope.

1217
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:06,950
Uh-huh.

1218
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:10,350
What's down here?

1219
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:12,690
Yeah, yeah.

1220
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,900
The blood bag is one of the most important items on the speedrun.

1221
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,420
Can remove 2 to 3 minutes.

1222
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:20,980
Oh my gosh!

1223
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:23,340
Oh yeah.

1224
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:23,720
That's right.

1225
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,420
We can't go in here.

1226
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,720
Have I explored everywhere?

1227
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:28,700
Except...

1228
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:33,790
What was in here?

1229
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,370
I know I went in here.

1230
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:37,130
But what was in here?

1231
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:38,050
Oh, just whatever.

1232
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:40,170
I think I have to go to the elevator.

1233
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:41,450
To the elevator.

1234
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:44,810
To the elevator.

1235
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:47,970
How many... okay, I got two strings?

1236
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,410
For these guys?

1237
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:51,850
I got two...

1238
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:53,690
Perfect.

1239
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,910
Okay, how do I want to handle these guys though?

1240
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:02,370
Coin?

1241
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,920
I don't have any more coins.

1242
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:14,480
I think we threw them away.

1243
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,480
Otherwise I'd be like, yeah, coin!

1244
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:20,140
Grenade.

1245
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,460
We could grenade them.

1246
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,720
We could nade them.

1247
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,240
Yeah.

1248
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:27,900
Hmm.

1249
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,940
Shoot the wall on the other side?

1250
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:37,740
Will that actually do anything?

1251
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:46,560
Okay.

1252
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,000
Now we're all bleeding out.

1253
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:48,960
So, me first.

1254
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,580
And then you guys, okay?

1255
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,540
Oh, shoot.

1256
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,260
And then I tie you up.

1257
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,040
Oops.

1258
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,440
Oh my god, no!

1259
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,600
This is messed up!

1260
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:08,750
Hold on!

1261
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,550
Order of operations or something!

1262
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:12,110
Oh, shoot.

1263
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:21,560
And then I tie you up.

1264
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,840
And then I bandage myself.

1265
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:25,560
And then I bandage myself.

1266
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,240
Oh, gosh!

1267
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:27,740
Oops.

1268
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:28,740
I fell asleep.

1269
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:30,620
Why did you...

1270
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:34,060
You just got shot and you wake up immediately after I heal you!

1271
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:36,860
Oops.

1272
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,440
I fell asleep.

1273
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:40,680
Oops.

1274
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:42,580
I fell asleep.

1275
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,100
Oops.

1276
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,040
I fell asleep.

1277
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:49,720
Two months in for me.

1278
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,980
The best is yet to come.

1279
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:52,200
Viridian, thank you!

1280
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,220
Let's up versus down.

1281
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:55,700
I'm scared.

1282
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,280
Let's go down.

1283
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,640
Into the basement.

1284
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:58,960
Oh!

1285
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,560
You think he's friendly?

1286
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:04,340
You think he's friendly?

1287
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,500
Welcome to the basement.

1288
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,580
Uh, thanks.

1289
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:08,960
Who are you?

1290
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,160
I'm the Lord of the Labyrinth.

1291
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:16,080
If I hadn't had enough already, a mental patient escaped from a ward.

1292
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,260
I played along.

1293
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,220
I'm Fox, son of Zox.

1294
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,320
I hail you, the Lord of the Labyrinth.

1295
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:23,840
I hail you, the Lord of the Labyrinth.

1296
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,240
What's behind that door?

1297
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:28,780
A dark labyrinth filled with deadly trash.

1298
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,280
Oh, no!

1299
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,180
Why did they build a maze down here?

1300
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:32,680
They didn't.

1301
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,680
The labyrinth already existed.

1302
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:35,600
Mysterious.

1303
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,020
This building was built over an old prison.

1304
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:39,980
Why the prison?

1305
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:42,520
Which was built over ancient catacombs.

1306
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,360
Oh, which was built over...

1307
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,760
It is said that the souls of the prisoners...

1308
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,700
Wait, there's ghosts down there!

1309
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,080
Are you trying to scare me with that children's story?

1310
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,480
It is merely a warning.

1311
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:57,200
Such is the esteemed duty of the Lord of the Labyrinth.

1312
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:57,740
Such is the esteemed duty of the Lord of the Labyrinth.

1313
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,100
I was curious about what was inside the labyrinth.

1314
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:00,920
Me too, I'm curious, I'm curious.

1315
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,980
But I had no business in these catacombs.

1316
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,880
No, the catacombs.

1317
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,380
We can escape through the catacombs!

1318
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,560
So I didn't think about those ridiculous stories.

1319
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,520
Although later, I'd be back.

1320
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:14,360
Do you wish to enter the labyrinth?

1321
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:14,940
Yes.

1322
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,820
No, thank you.

1323
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,440
Don't speak for me, Jesse Fox!

1324
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:20,420
Son of Zox.

1325
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,160
Do not speak for me.

1326
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,540
Oh wait, I didn't check to see if we could go down any further.

1327
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:28,900
Hold on, I'm just going to check real quick.

1328
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,760
I want to go in there!

1329
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:33,620
I want to go in there!

1330
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:35,020
Please!

1331
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,480
Okay, let's go up.

1332
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,520
Stinky socks.

1333
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,960
No stinky socks.

1334
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,220
I'm a little frightened about what's going to be in there though.

1335
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:51,960
To be honest.

1336
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,860
Oh wait, the alarm is still on this floor.

1337
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,060
Before we go any further, let's go up.

1338
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,180
See what else we can see.

1339
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,660
Okay, this one requires a key.

1340
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,480
Looks like there's some...

1341
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,840
experiments going on in here.

1342
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:06,880
Okay.

1343
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,240
Alright, let's go check this one.

1344
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,400
But I don't know what the alarms are like.

1345
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,440
So I guess we'll see.

1346
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,420
Why did it save?

1347
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,460
Why did it save?

1348
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,000
Freeze!

1349
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:32,600
What happened with Dr. Hoffman is kind of long to explain.

1350
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,960
Do you want me to summarize it?

1351
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,740
Tell us everything.

1352
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,080
Don't even think about it.

1353
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,740
Any detail can be crucial.

1354
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:46,900
Don't skip anything.

1355
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:54,280
Now, I want you to drop that fissile core uranium 235 isotope sample.

1356
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:54,920
Okay.

1357
01:06:55,080 --> 01:07:02,120
How in the world do you know that it's a fissile core uranium 235 isotope sample?

1358
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:07,760
What else would be in the hands of a scientist whose expertise is in fissile core uranium 235?

1359
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:09,840
Oh, they're just going to keep saying it.

1360
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:10,220
Oh no.

1361
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:17,980
How do you know I'm a scientist whose expertise is in fissile core uranium 235 isotopes?

1362
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,680
I know everything about Operation Geronimo.

1363
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,280
Now, drop that sample.

1364
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:28,720
Do you know what will happen if I drop this and the flask is broken?

1365
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,940
Of course I know.

1366
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,720
The alienation will flood the whole room.

1367
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,600
He's handling it without gloves.

1368
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,260
I know.

1369
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,080
I'm not telling you to literally drop it.

1370
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,220
I mean slowly set it on the table.

1371
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:44,420
It's okay.

1372
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,760
Don't get nervous.

1373
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:46,860
Same to you.

1374
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:47,640
Okay.

1375
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:49,200
Now turn around.

1376
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,400
Slowly.

1377
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,880
I'm afraid I can't turn around slowly.

1378
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:54,780
Why not?

1379
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,440
Because we're working in a 2D environment.

1380
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,140
I can only turn in multiples of 90 degrees.

1381
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,820
Turn around 90 degrees twice.

1382
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,160
But slowly, but slowly.

1383
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,480
You're the brains behind it all.

1384
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,980
You won't get away with this, you sick bastard.

1385
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,160
Operation Jericho will die with you.

1386
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:14,740
With you?

1387
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,360
Is everything okay, Dr. Hoffman?

1388
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,480
Oh, gosh.

1389
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,720
He has a weapon.

1390
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:21,360
Yeah, I do.

1391
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:22,900
Wait.

1392
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,260
You said Dr. Hoffman.

1393
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,420
Is your surname Hoffman?

1394
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:28,300
Yes.

1395
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:29,600
Why?

1396
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:31,640
What's up?

1397
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:33,700
I had a neighbor called Hoffman.

1398
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,900
He was tall, German, and hairy.

1399
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:36,300
No way.

1400
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,640
He won the lottery, but died of gonorrhea.

1401
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,160
That's right.

1402
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:40,540
Oh, man.

1403
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:41,560
Yes.

1404
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:43,720
Life can be cruel sometimes.

1405
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:44,600
Oh, it's not the same guy?

1406
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:45,140
Are you sure?

1407
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,920
But enough stories.

1408
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,300
What's the purity of the isotope you're using?

1409
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,960
Oh, this must be the long version, you know?

1410
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,200
Are you mad?

1411
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,140
That purity is highly unstable.

1412
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:55,420
How does he know so much?

1413
01:08:55,420 --> 01:09:00,120
You need to generate an absolute void field and contain that isotope in an electromagnetic field.

1414
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:00,900
I'm kind of getting hungry.

1415
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,020
That's what we do.

1416
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:05,440
We have containers of 500 megajoules.

1417
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,340
They're explaining everything.

1418
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:06,760
Oh, my God.

1419
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:10,040
A rabble like you invented the H-bomb.

1420
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,900
You disgust me.

1421
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,040
Hold on.

1422
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,880
H as in Hoffman.

1423
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:16,820
Hydrogen.

1424
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,500
Oh, my God.

1425
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,300
Oh, my God.

1426
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:24,200
This is some real, like, game theory levels of thinking.

1427
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,820
Don't try to confuse me with your scientific slang.

1428
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:32,580
Whether or not you're the mind behind this, you're the accomplice of a nuclear menace.

1429
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:34,920
Say goodbye, Dr. Hoffman.

1430
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:35,660
Wait.

1431
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,560
I did it against my will.

1432
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:39,080
Against?

1433
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:42,000
They have my daughter.

1434
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:46,460
If I don't do what they say, they'll kill her.

1435
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:47,380
Your daughter?

1436
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,300
Where are they keeping her?

1437
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,680
They have her working as a doctor.

1438
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:52,860
Wait.

1439
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,400
We know that hot doctor.

1440
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,260
The same one where I met the doctor.

1441
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:02,120
Suddenly, I pieced things together and everything made sense.

1442
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:02,860
Oh, my God.

1443
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,680
There were two doctors in that building.

1444
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:07,460
I never saw this man's daughter.

1445
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,960
Doctor, how old is she?

1446
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:10,700
Hot.

1447
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:12,880
Somewhere in her 30s.

1448
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,280
In her 30s?

1449
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,780
What kind of answer is that?

1450
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:20,000
A good father would say she turned 32 last April 31st.

1451
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,740
April only has 30 days.

1452
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:24,300
Don't change the subject.

1453
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,380
What sort of father are you?

1454
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:27,560
It's okay.

1455
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:35,360
I confess I've never been a good father since I've spent all my time absorbed in science.

1456
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,000
Uh-oh.

1457
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,780
Who's calling me?

1458
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,780
Who's calling you, Dr. Hoffman?

1459
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,240
Excuse me one moment.

1460
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:43,880
Hello, honey.

1461
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,580
This is not a good time.

1462
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,660
It's never a good time for you, Dad.

1463
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:48,880
I know.

1464
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:49,620
I know.

1465
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:49,920
It's her.

1466
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,440
But my current situation is particularly disastrous.

1467
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:54,500
Why?

1468
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:57,860
Because a man is pointing his gun at me.

1469
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:58,260
What?

1470
01:10:58,620 --> 01:10:59,520
Who is he?

1471
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:00,680
I don't know.

1472
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,260
He doesn't seem like he's from here.

1473
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,640
I want to go get my cake, but I don't want to miss the dialogue.

1474
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,940
Well, the cake is my breakfast, basically.

1475
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,800
I got it last night and I couldn't finish it.

1476
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:09,580
But I'm hungry.

1477
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,620
It's the only thing I've got.

1478
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:11,900
Are you Jesse Fox?

1479
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:12,580
Yes.

1480
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:13,640
Yes.

1481
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:15,020
It's him.

1482
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,260
Damn it all to hell.

1483
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:17,860
Do you know him?

1484
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:18,580
Honey?

1485
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:20,160
Are you there?

1486
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,000
Hello?

1487
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,580
It's a mill crave, you know?

1488
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,480
Oh, now she's calling me.

1489
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:26,400
Now it's mine.

1490
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:27,900
Hello?

1491
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:28,920
Jesse Fox here.

1492
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:29,440
Over.

1493
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,540
Can you tell me what the hell you're doing?

1494
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,140
Doctor, hey, hello.

1495
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:34,160
How are you?

1496
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,340
Not very happy.

1497
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,720
Knowing that you're aiming a gun at my father.

1498
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,880
Oh, he was telling the truth.

1499
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:40,700
Your... your father?

1500
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:41,720
Yes.

1501
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:42,880
Doctor.

1502
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:43,740
Doctor?

1503
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,120
This is not your father.

1504
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,320
What do you mean?

1505
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,540
Of course he is.

1506
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,500
That's what they're trying to get us to believe.

1507
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:56,880
In truth, he's the father of another doctor that works in your building.

1508
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:57,780
What?

1509
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,520
There are no other doctors.

1510
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:00,900
I'm the only one here.

1511
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:04,040
They're trying to make us believe that, too.

1512
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,100
They're manipulating us.

1513
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:12,660
Is your father, by any chance, an expert in nuclear chemistry who works in the Omega building?

1514
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:13,660
He's something.

1515
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:14,960
He's really something.

1516
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:16,980
The evidence finally collapsed in on itself.

1517
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:21,240
Besides two doctors, there were two scientist fathers.

1518
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:27,480
The one in front of me who also had a doctor daughter and the doctor's father.

1519
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,600
Really?

1520
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:30,300
Then explain something to me.

1521
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,300
I'm starting to get confused.

1522
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:40,820
How is it possible that someone like you, dedicated to looking after others, has a father that is involved in the annihilation of millions of people?

1523
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,340
What are you saying?

1524
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,700
My father is a good man.

1525
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,680
He's a brilliant scientist, not a killer.

1526
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:56,540
Well, the man in front of me is working with uranium for nuclear weapons that will be used to annihilate entire cities.

1527
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:57,200
What is...

1528
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,740
I think Jesse is a little silly.

1529
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,460
You see?

1530
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,600
I told you he wasn't your father.

1531
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,900
What should I do?

1532
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:05,940
Do I kill him?

1533
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:06,860
What?

1534
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:07,080
No!

1535
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,760
Tell him that...

1536
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,860
Doctor, I can't understand you if you cover your mouth.

1537
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,960
Doctor, shut up.

1538
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,180
Why did you tell her?

1539
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:21,680
Now my own daughter will hate me.

1540
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,580
Don't worry.

1541
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:23,820
She wasn't your daughter.

1542
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,780
She was the other doctor.

1543
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:27,760
What are you talking about?

1544
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,300
They're the same person.

1545
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,720
That's what they're trying to make us believe.

1546
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,560
You're toying with us.

1547
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,200
Are you really doing this for your daughter?

1548
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,080
Yes.

1549
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,240
I want her to be safe.

1550
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,040
Millions of people could die.

1551
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:48,240
I prefer the deaths of millions of people over the death of my precious daughter.

1552
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,620
You're a monster.

1553
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:51,900
It's not called being a monster.

1554
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,380
It's called being a father.

1555
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,400
If you had a daughter, you would understand Mr. Fox.

1556
01:13:58,780 --> 01:13:59,420
Enough!

1557
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,980
That was really something.

1558
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,100
Don't be an asshole.

1559
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,260
I know that.

1560
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,780
I mean, how do I reach the rooftop?

1561
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,400
And don't stall me, understood?

1562
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,120
Another stupid answer and I shoot.

1563
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,080
I don't think you'll do it.

1564
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,300
You don't look like an assassin.

1565
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,940
I got rookie's eyes.

1566
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:27,000
It was an accident.

1567
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:27,020
It was an accident.

1568
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,540
It was

1569
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,980
eating.

1570
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:38,840
It's fine.

1571
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:39,500
It is but a scratch.

1572
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,140
Come on, my friend.

1573
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,240
Stand up.

1574
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,460
The blood.

1575
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:48,100
I'm going to repeat the question one last time.

1576
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,520
And this time, I won't miss.

1577
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:51,900
Excuse me.

1578
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,440
You didn't miss.

1579
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:54,500
You hit me.

1580
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,540
That's true.

1581
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,600
Then this time, I won't heal anyone.

1582
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:58,100
Yeah.

1583
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:59,680
And how do I reach the rooftop?

1584
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,540
There is a lift that reaches the rooftop.

1585
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:05,280
You just have to keep going up as much as you can.

1586
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,340
Okay, I did that.

1587
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,060
But you will need a level 4 access card to go out.

1588
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:09,440
Oh, no.

1589
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,340
Give me your access card.

1590
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,580
Give me a level 4 access card.

1591
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,580
If we don't have one, we just have level 3 access cards.

1592
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,660
I swear.

1593
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:19,520
But you're scientists.

1594
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,080
I'll have to search for it.

1595
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:24,500
Now.

1596
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:27,520
Continue working as if nothing happened.

1597
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:28,620
Nothing happened.

1598
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,440
Do something suspicious.

1599
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:31,580
Nothing.

1600
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:32,460
You'll kill us.

1601
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:34,780
Promise the doctor not to kill anyone.

1602
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,060
Huffman's daughter.

1603
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,000
The other one.

1604
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,120
You had no intention to shoot me, right?

1605
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:42,860
No.

1606
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,280
You see?

1607
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,640
I told you that you didn't look like an assassin.

1608
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,140
Why did you?

1609
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:49,620
Jesse, no!

1610
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:57,860
You can't imagine how much I hate myself for what they're forcing me to do.

1611
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:01,200
In the end, I talked to them about my escape.

1612
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,680
About Colonel Harris.

1613
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:07,300
And the promise I made to him to call the cavalry if I managed to escape.

1614
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,360
That gave Dr. Huffman and his team some small hope of rescue.

1615
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,380
I wonder how short the short version of the explanation is.

1616
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:19,040
That would be used in Operation Jericho for as long as he could.

1617
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,980
After that, I asked him for some assistance in my escape.

1618
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,460
But he was terrified of being discovered.

1619
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:29,260
Which would compromise his daughter's safety.

1620
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,580
So he decided to stay neutral.

1621
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,720
But still volunteered some information.

1622
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:34,480
Okay, okay.

1623
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,560
Take the info.

1624
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,200
What's the info?

1625
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:38,940
What's the info?

1626
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,340
Let's go save.

1627
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,900
That was... quite silly.

1628
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:57,750
And the blood on the floor.

1629
01:16:58,910 --> 01:16:59,510
Wow!

1630
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:00,130
Oh my gosh!

1631
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:00,430
Joy!

1632
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:03,610
Thank you for the 200!

1633
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:05,050
Thank you for the Hakasuba!

1634
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:06,110
Holy moly!

1635
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:06,710
Thank you!

1636
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:07,370
Why?

1637
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:10,070
Another thing.

1638
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:11,930
Don't shoot in the lab.

1639
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:17,090
Most of these devices don't react well to bullets.

1640
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:17,690
Okay.

1641
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:22,510
I won't.

1642
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:23,510
Shoot.

1643
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:26,050
I won't.

1644
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:31,370
Act like nothing happened.

1645
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:33,550
Act like nothing happened.

1646
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:35,330
Yeah.

1647
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:38,610
Yeah.

1648
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:41,070
You're not going inside, are you?

1649
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:42,870
I'm just going to have a quick look.

1650
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:43,430
Yeah.

1651
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:45,030
What's in there?

1652
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:50,550
Microwave hallway!

1653
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:51,570
Microwave hallway!

1654
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:53,750
Oh my god.

1655
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:54,690
There's beetles in here?

1656
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:55,270
What the hell?

1657
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:56,770
Why are there...

1658
01:17:58,990 --> 01:17:59,870
I have...

1659
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:03,190
I threw out my thermal suit too.

1660
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:08,520
Who are you?

1661
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:10,620
Who are you?

1662
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:14,020
I like the music in here.

1663
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,360
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

1664
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:17,240
Be careful in there.

1665
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:19,320
There are patrols of mechanical spiders.

1666
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,460
They can see in every direction.

1667
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:21,680
What?

1668
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:23,540
They may be shut down somehow.

1669
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:26,280
Only with an electromagnetic grenade.

1670
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,780
But it would only last a few seconds.

1671
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,860
Enough time to let them taste my fists.

1672
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:33,680
My fists.

1673
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,960
Please, carry on with your genocide work.

1674
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:41,350
Okay.

1675
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,360
Nice.

1676
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:52,700
Nice.

1677
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:54,740
Nice.

1678
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:56,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1679
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,580
How do I get in here?

1680
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,560
Okay.

1681
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,980
Alright, kaboom, kabowee.

1682
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:07,340
Yeah.

1683
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:23,100
I don't mind the spiders so much right now.

1684
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:24,940
Mechorachnophobia.

1685
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,020
Snake?

1686
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:31,260
No, this is Jessie.

1687
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,540
I mind the spiders.

1688
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,040
I mind the spiders.

1689
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:37,520
I mind the spiders.

1690
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,200
Oh my god.

1691
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,640
Wait, this is messed up!

1692
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:44,240
This is messed up!

1693
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:50,910
They follow, they follow, they follow, they follow!

1694
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:52,350
Okay.

1695
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:53,550
Oh my gosh.

1696
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,580
I mind the spiders.

1697
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:09,260
I mind the spiders now.

1698
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:11,060
Wait.

1699
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:11,200
Okay.

1700
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:12,720
What do I need to...

1701
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,460
Let's just go.

1702
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:19,410
Be careful in there.

1703
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:20,630
Okay.

1704
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:27,860
My goodness.

1705
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,040
My goodness, goodness, goodness.

1706
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:34,060
My goodness, goodness, goodness.

1707
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:35,200
And they follow.

1708
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:38,700
And

1709
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:43,300
they follow.

1710
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,780
He said a few seconds but he didn't elaborate.

1711
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,620
How much is a few seconds?

1712
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,780
You know, like...

1713
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:56,340
Like three seconds like the cameras?

1714
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,620
Or what?

1715
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,060
I'm scared of that.

1716
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,860
Three seconds just like the cameras?

1717
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:08,660
Raid of mecha spiders.

1718
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,480
Probably three like the cameras.

1719
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,940
Alright, just before that.

1720
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,300
Just before that, you know.

1721
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:15,920
Hold on.

1722
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:20,990
Yeah.

1723
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:25,530
Yeah.

1724
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:25,910
Yeah.

1725
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:26,170
Okay.

1726
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:37,110
Re-punch everything?

1727
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:38,210
Oh, you know it.

1728
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,510
I'm destroying their research!

1729
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:48,380
Okay.

1730
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:49,560
Now we know.

1731
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:56,690
I missed.

1732
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:00,090
It's okay.

1733
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:04,330
I gotta be careful because I can see on all sides.

1734
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:08,790
So it's more like just kind of waiting it out for him to come back.

1735
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:14,640
Come on, little spider!

1736
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,560
Come on, little spider!

1737
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,340
Come on, little spider!

1738
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:21,800
Oh my god!

1739
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,240
Wait, wait, wait!

1740
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:30,420
Okay, we got him.

1741
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,200
Oh my gosh!

1742
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,160
Thank you!

1743
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:38,950
Are you okay?

1744
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:42,770
Is your wallet okay?

1745
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:43,430
Please.

1746
01:22:45,530 --> 01:22:46,410
Thank you though!

1747
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:46,890
Thank you!

1748
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:53,090
Two of them.

1749
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:55,210
Oh...

1750
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:00,410
What if I punch this?

1751
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:05,430
Radiation.

1752
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:16,690
I think I missed my window of opportunity.

1753
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:18,490
For some of this.

1754
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:19,430
Look at them!

1755
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:21,290
They need them to group up like that.

1756
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:23,190
Wait!

1757
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:29,400
It's wasted!

1758
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:35,860
No... Oh, dang it.

1759
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:36,700
I

1760
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:42,860
thought he would go down, you know, or to the right instead.

1761
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:44,040
No!

1762
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:46,560
Nooo!

1763
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:53,680
Oh, now you go over to the right, you asshole!

1764
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:56,820
You son of a bitch, you...

1765
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:59,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1766
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:07,070
Yeah!

1767
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:09,150
Okay, okay, okay.

1768
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:10,230
Okay, okay, okay.

1769
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:12,050
Nice, nice.

1770
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:12,310
Nice, nice.

1771
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:14,610
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1772
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:15,950
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1773
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:17,050
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1774
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:20,410
Hold on, there was a... I'm gonna grab this grenade just in case.

1775
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:22,370
Just in case I need another one.

1776
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:23,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1777
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:27,570
I'm also... Nah, I'll just save with a...

1778
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:29,490
...a toilet.

1779
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:33,230
Destroy, destroy, destroy!

1780
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:34,850
Vivi, go away!

1781
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:35,790
Thanks for the gift!

1782
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:37,670
Did you watch the new Beetlejuice?

1783
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:38,110
Is it good?

1784
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:43,010
I just noticed your profile picture as well.

1785
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:44,110
That's why I'm wondering.

1786
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:46,050
Does anyone watch the new Beetlejuice?

1787
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:51,010
It's fine.

1788
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:56,230
It's good, yeah?

1789
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:56,830
You liked it?

1790
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:09,750
We got our anti-rod suit!

1791
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:12,690
And now we're good to go.

1792
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:14,630
That's pretty good.

1793
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:17,150
This looks like it could be a secret.

1794
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:21,730
If you punch long enough...

1795
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:24,770
If you destroy any wall, any wall could be a secret.

1796
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:30,470
Minto juice, minto juice, minto juice.

1797
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:33,510
Just watching it was alright, yeah?

1798
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:38,510
Did it feel like a good...

1799
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:40,130
What's the word?

1800
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:45,230
Mr. Fox!

1801
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:46,250
Mr. Fox!

1802
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:47,410
I'm coming!

1803
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:50,310
Like a good, you know...

1804
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:50,950
What's up, Hoffman?

1805
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:52,130
My daughter.

1806
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:54,270
She is not replying.

1807
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:55,110
Continuation?

1808
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:55,710
I guess sequel?

1809
01:25:55,870 --> 01:25:56,270
I don't know.

1810
01:25:56,910 --> 01:25:57,590
Faithful remake?

1811
01:25:57,710 --> 01:25:58,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1812
01:25:58,510 --> 01:25:59,490
Oh my gosh, Joy!

1813
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:02,270
Too many coincidences.

1814
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:03,050
That cow!

1815
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:04,730
What if they killed her?

1816
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:06,110
Why would they do that?

1817
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:10,850
If they do, you no longer have a reason to continue your work here.

1818
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:13,950
That's not the point here, Jesse.

1819
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:15,550
But, rely on us and wait a while.

1820
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:20,530
And remember to delay those nuclear warheads as much as you can.

1821
01:26:20,890 --> 01:26:23,370
God knows what will happen if they get completed.

1822
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:24,770
Yeah!

1823
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,820
Angel, thanks for the gift then!

1824
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:34,600
Thank you!

1825
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,700
Thank you guys so much!

1826
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,520
Really appreciate it.

1827
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:46,860
That's me punching the air.

1828
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:47,460
Yeah!

1829
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,060
Yeah!

1830
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:48,360
Yeah!

1831
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:51,970
Hit the robot!

1832
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:52,530
Yeah!

1833
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:53,110
Yeah!

1834
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:53,570
Yeah!

1835
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:55,730
Thanks for the gift then.

1836
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:57,230
Okay.

1837
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:59,250
We got to put on our suit.

1838
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:00,470
And we can't...

1839
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:02,710
Oh no, we can't punch in the suit.

1840
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:06,490
Are you going inside?

1841
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,550
I'm just going to have a quick look.

1842
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:10,570
Thank you for the five gift then.

1843
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:11,510
Casey, thanks for the gift then.

1844
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:14,410
So wear the anti-rat suit the entire time.

1845
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:17,970
Oh wait.

1846
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:20,790
Okay, thanks for the gift then!

1847
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:22,610
Thank you guys!

1848
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:24,870
Oh crap.

1849
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:27,570
I can't throw...

1850
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:28,690
I can't throw bombs either.

1851
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:29,210
Okay.

1852
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:30,810
Oh my gosh.

1853
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:32,130
Thank you for the 50 gift then.

1854
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:33,050
What is happening?

1855
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:33,790
What is going on?

1856
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:35,730
Oh, I have to...

1857
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:37,410
Okay, I have to take it off.

1858
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:37,990
Throw it.

1859
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:38,490
Take it off.

1860
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:39,090
Punch.

1861
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:45,780
I see.

1862
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:46,020
I see.

1863
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:46,320
I see.

1864
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:46,560
I see.

1865
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:46,740
I see.

1866
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:49,320
But I recover HP.

1867
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,360
So actually this isn't so bad.

1868
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,060
I think.

1869
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:53,320
Maybe.

1870
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,640
Oh, I missed my chance.

1871
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,020
But I...

1872
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:11,380
It's really the amount of grenades.

1873
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,120
I might need more.

1874
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:14,420
Which is the issue.

1875
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:16,880
That's the issue.

1876
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,460
Jesus, thanks for the five gift then.

1877
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:24,990
Yay!

1878
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:26,750
Yay, yay, yay!

1879
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:33,510
Is he going to come over here?

1880
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:34,010
Oh my god.

1881
01:28:34,030 --> 01:28:34,390
Object!

1882
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:35,310
Thank you for the 20!

1883
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:36,410
What's going on?

1884
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,560
Nice, nice, nice!

1885
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:44,120
Nice!

1886
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,060
What is happening?

1887
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,060
Why is everybody getting gifted?

1888
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:52,770
Here.

1889
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:53,810
Punch, punch, punch!

1890
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:54,230
Thank you!

1891
01:28:57,610 --> 01:28:58,830
This guy is right here.

1892
01:28:58,950 --> 01:28:59,410
Okay, hold on.

1893
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:01,650
Just saying!

1894
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:02,490
Thank you for the 20!

1895
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:03,970
Thank you for the 20!

1896
01:29:06,610 --> 01:29:07,330
What's happening?

1897
01:29:09,490 --> 01:29:09,890
Goose!

1898
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:11,170
Thank you for the 20.

Thanks for the gifted!

1904
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,620
Ducky, thanks for the five!

1905
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:21,840
I have 10!

1906
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,260
Oh!

1907
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,820
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

1908
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:28,780
I missed my chance.

1909
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:36,060
Yay!

1910
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:37,400
Enjoy!

1911
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,880
Thank you for the 50!

1912
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,820
What is going on?!

1913
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:43,960
Oh my gosh!

1914
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:44,660
Oh my gosh!

1915
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:45,100
Oh my gosh!

1916
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,160
Thank you guys so, so much!

1917
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,240
What is happening?

1918
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:01,090
My butt.

1919
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:03,090
My butt.

1920
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:06,670
My birthday isn't until... the end of this month!

1921
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:08,030
Oh my gosh!

1922
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:09,510
You guys, my birthday is coming up.

1923
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:14,250
It's been like three years since I've celebrated my birthday.

1924
01:30:17,770 --> 01:30:19,630
Oh my gosh, thank you.

1925
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:23,070
Okay, thank you.

1926
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:23,750
Thank you!

1927
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:25,610
Wait

1928
01:30:42,910 --> 01:30:43,530
for birthdays.

1929
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:45,710
Yeah.

1930
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:46,790
Oh my gosh.

1931
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:48,510
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1932
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:49,830
Thank you so much, but please.

1933
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:52,110
It's okay.

1934
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,110
You don't have to do it.

1935
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:53,850
You don't have to give.

1936
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:54,350
It's okay.

1937
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:56,370
It's okay!

1938
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:08,680
Let's go October!

1939
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:09,120
Yeah!

1940
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:21,950
Joy.

1941
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:24,470
Joy, your wallet.

1942
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:24,890
Seriously.

1943
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:26,870
I really appreciate it, but please.

1944
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:29,790
Please don't feel like you have to.

1945
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:32,150
Please don't feel like you have to!

1946
01:31:35,650 --> 01:31:36,810
Thank you so much, but please!

1947
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:42,990
Oh man.

1948
01:31:43,690 --> 01:31:45,130
Not the cameras again.

1949
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:46,950
Wait, I only have one...

1950
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:49,350
One left.

1951
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:52,310
Uh-oh.

1952
01:31:57,790 --> 01:31:59,450
Thank you so much for all the gifts.

1953
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:00,590
You guys, thank you!

1954
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:03,670
There's too many names for even for me to see.

1955
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:05,050
I'll try and say some.

1956
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:07,390
Um, Farinibus, thank you!

1957
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:08,730

01:32:47,190 --> 01:32:48,110
I think I got all of them.

1987
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:48,950
I think.

1988
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:49,310
I hope.

1989
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:50,650
If I missed you, I'm so sorry.

01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:53,730

Take this!

1993
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:01,930
Critical hit.

1994
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:02,670
Seriously.

1995
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:14,860
NO!

1996
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:18,000
Hey, Fox, you there?

1997
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:18,460
Yeah.

1998
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:19,300
Here I am.

1999
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:19,720
Garlim hele!

2000
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:22,880
Thank you for the I don't think you're home.

2001
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,800
The radio signal wouldn't reach...

2002
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,560
I'm in the Omega building.

2003
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:27,820
Fuck, man!

2004
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:29,780
Why they're prepping the nukes?

2005
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:30,260
Yeah...

2006
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,540
You decide to stop them.

2007
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:33,200
What a change of heart man.

2008
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:33,560
Yeah.

2009
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:35,500
No, it wasn't intentional.

2010
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,420
Then why the hell are you there?

2011
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:38,500
I'm...

2012
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,320
We even bought a boat.

2013
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:50,580
Oh shoot.

2014
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:51,040
What?

2015
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:51,940
They're coming in!

2016
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,280
Oh, we're so... You guys, this is it.

2017
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:55,140
It's so over.

2018
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:56,660
It's so over!

2019
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,520
It's so over!

2020
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:58,140
It's so over!

2021
01:33:58,220 --> 01:33:59,520
I wish I could be a box!

2022
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:02,460
Oh my god, there's so many guys here.

2023
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:13,230
Where do I need to restart from?

2024
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:16,070
No.

2025
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:17,430
Wait.

2026
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:21,890
Oh no!

2027
01:34:22,050 --> 01:34:23,890
Are you kidding me right now?

2028
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:26,770
No way!

2029
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:35,350
I should have saved before I got... I thought it saved.

2030
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:37,770
I should have saved.

2031
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:53,100
I don't think I can avoid the spiders.

2032
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:57,560
Because they follow me when they see me and they also see in all directions, you know?

2033
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:02,780
So... I think it's best if I actually just destroy them.

2034
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:03,620
Oh shoot.

2035
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:04,180
Oh shoot.

2036
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:04,540
Oh shoot.

2037
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:04,880
Oh shoot.

2038
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:07,480
That was close.

2039
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:16,880
Actually, no.

2040
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:18,120
I wouldn't be able to make it.

2041
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:20,300
We'll wait for him to come up here.

2042
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:25,500
No...

2043
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:27,680
No...

2044
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:30,840
Do they see infinitely far?

2045
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,680
That I do not know.

2046
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,400
That I'm not sure about.

2047
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:40,200
But...

2048
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:43,860
When I... If I kill a couple, I can like go and...

2049
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:44,920
You know...

2050
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:46,420
Go and save or something.

2051
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:48,480
Afterwards, you know?

2052
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:52,780
I think we have to wait for this guy to come back over here.

2053
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:54,680
Yeah.

2054
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:56,360
No biggie.

2055
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:58,320
Oh, never mind.

2056
01:35:58,440 --> 01:35:59,480
I thought he was gonna go up.

2057
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,580
The gifts are still going.

2058
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,480
I know they're like clogging up the chat.

2059
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:09,500
Oh shoot.

2060
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:11,840
I forgot to put on my thing.

2061
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:13,220
Okay.

2062
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:14,500
Now I'll go save.

2063
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:18,540
I'll go save just so that we have...

2064
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:20,280
I know I can save with the potty.

2065
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:21,480
Like the porta potty.

2066
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,100
But it's okay.

2067
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:25,700
It's fine.

2068
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:26,240
Probably.

2069
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:28,740
It's probably fine.

2070
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,360
It's probably fine.

2071
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,560
You need to go potty?

2072
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:35,920
Yeah.

2073
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:41,590
Well...

2074
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:43,650
If you got gifted a membership...

2075
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:44,750
You know...

2076
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,230
I sometimes post little hints and stuff.

2077
01:36:47,290 --> 01:36:48,310
I have future things.

2078
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:48,930
So...

2079
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:50,090
You know...

2080
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:52,930
Maybe some hints have been posted.

2081
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:53,610
Maybe...

2082
01:36:53,610 --> 01:36:54,810
As of recent...

2083
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:55,450
As of...

2084
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:56,250
Today?

2085
01:36:56,590 --> 01:36:57,090
Who knows?

2086
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:57,890
I don't know.

2087
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:00,750
So you can go check the community tab.

2088
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:03,130
And stuff.

2089
01:37:03,410 --> 01:37:04,170
I don't know.

2090
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:05,330
If you want.

2091
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:06,850
It's cool.

2092
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:07,990
If you don't want to either.

2093
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:08,350
Whatever.

2094
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:23,010
Hint hint.

2095
01:37:23,830 --> 01:37:24,970
Whatever could it mean?

2096
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:26,410
And look!

2097
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:27,390
I have three left now!

2098
01:37:27,650 --> 01:37:29,190
I actually have more than I did before.

2099
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:36,040
Okay.

2100
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,200
There's just one in here.

2101
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:39,580
So we at least need to save it for that one.

2102
01:37:57,490 --> 01:37:59,370
How do I want to time this?

2103
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:02,630
How do I want to time this?

2104
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:07,100
Hmm...

2105
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,680
What did you send?

2106
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:10,540
What did you send?

2107
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:11,940
Oh.

2108
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:12,680
Just your name.

2109
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:13,640
Go stop.

2110
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,120
Okay.

2111
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:17,540
Let's go.

2112
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:18,100
What is their name?

2113
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:20,260
You guys, just ignore.

2114
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:20,860
Just ignore.

2115
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:30,200
I think like here.

2116
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:35,380
Yeah!

2117
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,120
Okay, we saw this part.

2118
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,060
We saw that part.

2119
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:44,680
We saw that part.

2120
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:46,460
Now I'm gonna save again.

2121
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:49,620
Nice!

2122
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:52,660
Oh,

2123
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:00,160
I didn't get to destroy those.

2124
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:03,860
Guys, this is bad.

2125
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:04,340
This is bad.

2126
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,500
I don't have any more grenades.

2127
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:06,920
Oh, wait.

2128
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:08,760
I have more grenades!

2129
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:13,640
Yippee!

2130
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:17,140
I have more grenades.

2131
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:23,110
But how to?

2132
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:33,740
How to?

2133
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:41,590
How to?

2134
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:43,890
How to?

2135
01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:45,330
This is cyborg.

2136
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:46,030
Thanks for the 500.

2137
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:47,250
How to?

2138
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:48,670
How...

2139
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:49,350
Oh, wait.

2140
01:39:49,470 --> 01:39:50,670
I can just walk under, can't I?

2141
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:54,410
And then...

2142
01:39:54,410 --> 01:39:55,250
Oh, shoot.

2143
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:57,750
Okay, I just... I shoot or I do this.

2144
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,310
And then we gotta punch real fast.

2145
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:02,310
Real fast, real furious.

2146
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:06,770
Oh,

2147
01:40:11,690 --> 01:40:12,870
I can't... Oh my god!

2148
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:15,930
That scared me.

2149
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:35,380
Let's go.

2150
01:40:38,710 --> 01:40:40,530
And these guys aren't Scandinavian.

2151
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:43,890
So they don't need...

2152
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:45,770
They can just fall asleep.

2153
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:47,190
Oh, no.

2154
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:52,430
He's not Scandinavian, so he doesn't need the rope.

2155
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:53,830
Dang it.

2156
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:54,830
I wanted to rope him.

2157
01:40:56,470 --> 01:40:56,870
Save?

2158
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:58,710
Oh, I guess I can save here, can't I?

2159
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:00,770
Now that I've put that guy to sleep, huh?

2160
01:41:02,330 --> 01:41:02,970
There we go.

2161
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:03,710
Nice.

2162
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:06,450
Thanks for reminding me.

2163
01:41:08,590 --> 01:41:10,670
That was so close!

2164
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:25,710
Oopsie!

2165
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:32,330
I keep wanting to... I keep wanting to chloroform them instead of pressing X.

2166
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:33,470
You know?

2167
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:35,790
It's just a silly habit.

2168
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:39,430
Oh, this room looks important.

2169
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:44,650
There's operations materials in here.

2170
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:46,170
For sure.

2171
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:47,690
I'll find it.

2172
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:48,530
I got...

2173
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:48,750
Oh!

2174
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:51,150
KGS protocol.

2175
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:56,500
Oh.

2176
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:56,880
Oh.

2177
01:41:59,200 --> 01:41:59,960
Oh.

2178
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:01,060
Oh.

2179
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:01,500
Oh.

2180
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,300
Oh.

2181
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:02,920
Oh.

2182
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:03,280
Oh.

2183
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:03,340
Oh.

2184
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:03,440
Oh.

2185
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:04,440
Huh?

2186
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:06,100
Huh?

2187
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:08,440
Okay.

2188
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:11,700
Level four!

2189
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:17,900
We found the access card floor.

2190
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,520
This was the access card I needed to reach the rooftop.

2191
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:21,160
Yippee!

2192
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:24,240
Now I just had to check if there were any helicopters up there.

2193
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:24,840
Yes.

2194
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:28,000
Saved, baby, saved.

2195
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:34,770
These guys are still down.

2196
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:36,730
We can now check in here.

2197
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:39,270
This is a high room.

2198
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:40,530
Oh!

2199
01:42:40,730 --> 01:42:41,250
Jagerical.

2200
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:41,970
Files.

2201
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:42,450
Files.

2202
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:43,590
Cigarettes.

2203
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:45,890
Other stuff.

2204
01:42:47,490 --> 01:42:48,490
The world.

2205
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:49,070
The world.

2206
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:49,570
The world.

2207
01:42:49,610 --> 01:42:50,110
The world.

2208
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:52,050
The world.

2209
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:55,390
The fifth document was a shopping list.

2210
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:56,350
A shopping list?

2211
01:42:56,550 --> 01:43:00,470
A collection of military vehicles they bought from the Soviet Union when it collapsed.

2212
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:00,990
Oh.

2213
01:43:00,990 --> 01:43:01,170
Not eggs.

2214
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:01,990
Trucks.

2215
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:02,470
Tanks.

2216
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:03,350
Armored vehicles.

2217
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:04,310
Helicopters.

2218
01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:04,690
Oh.

2219
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:05,730
I thought like a grocery list.

2220
01:43:05,990 --> 01:43:06,250
And nuclear submarines.

2221
01:43:07,490 --> 01:43:09,250
Submarines like the one that attacked us.

2222
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:09,410
They attacked me.

2223
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:11,270
Now they have one less.

2224
01:43:11,790 --> 01:43:15,430
The fourth document was the logbook of a mini rescue submarine.

2225
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:15,750
Okay.

2226
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:17,130
We know all these other ones.

2227
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:19,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2228
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:22,750
Bread, butter, milk.

2229
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:23,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2230
01:43:27,530 --> 01:43:29,250
Now this guy we have to coin.

2231
01:43:31,070 --> 01:43:33,110
This is a guy that gets a coin.

2232
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:36,770
Hey!

2233
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:37,890
A coin!

2234
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:38,390
Hey!

2235
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:39,250
A coin!

2236
01:43:47,850 --> 01:43:48,350
Hey!

2237
01:43:48,570 --> 01:43:49,270
A grenade!

2238
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:53,270
Oh!

2239
01:43:57,090 --> 01:43:57,590
Okay.

2240
01:44:03,330 --> 01:44:09,290
This is gonna sound really stupid but I'm going to go all the way back and I'm going to save.

2241
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:11,190
Actually I have to put this back.

2242
01:44:11,190 --> 01:44:17,370
Because I don't know when the next cutscene is going to happen, but I want to free up my toilets, essentially.

2243
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:19,630
I want to free up my toilets.

2244
01:44:20,470 --> 01:44:22,450
So that I can...

2245
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:25,730
Never mind!

2246
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:27,350
I changed my mind about that.

2247
01:44:27,810 --> 01:44:28,690
Let's just...

2248
01:44:30,830 --> 01:44:32,170
It'll save, probably.

2249
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:36,470
Never mind!

2250
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:36,670
Never mind!

2251
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:37,370
I just...

2252
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:42,610
That's not what I wanted to do.

2253
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:46,250
Anyway.

2254
01:44:49,190 --> 01:44:50,410
I want that.

2255
01:44:52,990 --> 01:44:54,190
Do you think they'll see me?

2256
01:44:58,740 --> 01:44:59,700
Oh, a coin!

2257
01:45:26,010 --> 01:45:27,250
Hey, a coin!

2258
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:31,170
Me first.

2259
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:33,010
Then you guys.

2260
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,020
I didn't mean to heal myself.

2261
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:43,860
I'm so stupid.

2262
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,880
I did not mean to heal myself!

2263
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:51,000
I got the coin, though.

2264
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:55,820
Photographs!

2265
01:45:56,940 --> 01:45:57,460
On a desk.

2266
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:58,760
I had a look at them.

2267
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,100
Because, you know...

2268
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:01,520
I was born curious.

2269
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:02,140
Wait.

2270
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:02,820
Curious?

2271
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:04,780
Don't you mean nosy?

2272
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:05,260
I'm bored.

2273
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:08,040
There were shots of some guys loading something big onto trucks.

2274
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:08,280
Oh my gosh!

2275
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,000
It's his photographs!

2276
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:10,760
Something that looked like...

2277
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:12,700
Concrete blocks!

2278
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:14,280
Fuck.

2279
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:15,100
Thank you.

2280
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:15,500
Thank you.

2281
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,980
These were the photos Robert was taking just before he was captured.

2282
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:20,180
Thank you.

2283
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,400
We got his photos!

2284
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:25,180
We got his photos.

2285
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,360
See, it was worth.

2286
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:31,840
It was worth, maybe.

2287
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:32,240
Oh.

2288
01:46:40,830 --> 01:46:41,310
Okay.

2289
01:46:42,930 --> 01:46:44,230
Look at this graph.

2290
01:46:45,970 --> 01:46:47,990
Every time it makes me a graph.

2291
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,450
Look at this graph.

2292
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:52,930
Hold on.

2293
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:54,670
There was a kit over here.

2294
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:54,950
Yeah.

2295
01:46:54,970 --> 01:46:55,630
I'm going to grab this.

2296
01:46:56,570 --> 01:46:57,050
Okay.

2297
01:47:01,730 --> 01:47:02,290
Nice.

2298
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:05,190
Oh, yeah.

2299
01:47:05,230 --> 01:47:05,910
Let's talk to Robert.

2300
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:06,570
Robert!

2301
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:08,570
I got your photos.

2302
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:09,390
I hear you.

2303
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:10,670
Guess what I found.

2304
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:11,110
Yeah.

2305
01:47:11,230 --> 01:47:12,510
The love of your life.

2306
01:47:12,590 --> 01:47:12,930
Yeah.

2307
01:47:13,130 --> 01:47:13,630
And your photos.

2308
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:14,930
Oh, really?

2309
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:16,670
They didn't destroy them?

2310
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:17,110
No.

2311
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:17,630
No.

2312
01:47:17,630 --> 01:47:19,670
They must have Diogenes syndrome.

2313
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:20,210
What?

2314
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:22,610
Are you saying my pics are trash?

2315
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:23,630
Man.

2316
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:26,870
These pictures leave a lot to be desired.

2317
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:27,030
Oh, yeah.

2318
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:28,530
Why are you such a jerk, Jesse?

2319
01:47:28,530 --> 01:47:31,210
Did you take them with one of those disposable cardboard cameras?

2320
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:34,190
You're such an ass.

2321
01:47:34,510 --> 01:47:36,090
Only the smartest of them.

2322
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:36,830
Oh, my God.

2323
01:47:36,830 --> 01:47:37,710
Take them with you, my friend.

2324
01:47:37,870 --> 01:47:39,350
I hope they help you for something.

2325
01:47:39,590 --> 01:47:40,250
Will do.

2326
01:47:40,570 --> 01:47:41,310
Over and out.

2327
01:47:41,350 --> 01:47:42,010
We have the evidence.

2328
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:44,490
Because we went for the coin.

2329
01:47:46,050 --> 01:47:47,990
Jesse, why are you being such a smart ass, huh?

2330
01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:54,210
Oh, we're back here.

2331
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:57,010
Oh, my God.

2332
01:47:57,850 --> 01:47:58,530
Oh, my God.

2333
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:01,070
That means this is the lab which takes me to the party.

2334
01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:02,770
Yeah.

2335
01:48:05,050 --> 01:48:06,310
A full loop.

2336
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:06,610
Yeah.

2337
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:12,100
Perfect.

2338
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:15,020
Let's reload and then save.

2339
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:27,980
I keep pressing the hotkey on accident, which I never use.

2340
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:28,980
Oh.

2341
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:30,540
But you know.

2342
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:31,240
Alright.

2343
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:34,860
Time to go... to the roof.

2344
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:36,940
To the wall!

2345
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:38,820
To the roof!

2346
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:41,020
To the wall!

2347
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:42,060
Let's see.

2348
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:49,600
Fun fact, if you wear the sunglasses, Jesse won't go for the coin and he can get the photos without an alert.

2349
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:50,820
No way!

2350
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:55,060
That's what the- I've been wondering what the sunglasses have been for this whole time!

2351
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,380
Oh, there are?

2352
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:02,720
But these were not your run-of-the-mill guards.

2353
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:05,380
They were Japanese mercenaries.

2354
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,300
Were they also tougher than normal guards?

2355
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:09,640
No way!

2356
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:10,880
On the contrary.

2357
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:11,960
They were weaker.

2358
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:14,000
One punch and down they went.

2359
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:19,140
But these Japanese mercs were damn perceptive due to special training they received.

2360
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:22,840
Their unique awareness was twice that of a normal guard.

2361
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,040
An angle of 180 degrees.

2362
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:30,360
Getting close to them unnoticed was impossible if you weren't behind their back.

2363
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:31,380
I see.

2364
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:33,820
Oh, and that guy is running?

2365
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:35,000
Okay.

2366
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:42,000
So this guy can see the whole hallway, essentially, is what you're trying to tell me.

2367
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:52,910
The guy next to- the guy down here can see the whole hallway.

2368
01:49:56,070 --> 01:49:58,510
Oh, that is not- I meant to press F.

2369
01:49:58,650 --> 01:50:00,250
Oh, that is not- I meant to press F.

2370
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:00,470
Oh, that is not- I meant to press F.

2371
01:50:03,070 --> 01:50:03,830
Hey!

2372
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:04,890
A coin!

2373
01:50:05,510 --> 01:50:05,910
Hey!

2374
01:50:06,950 --> 01:50:07,890
A coin!

2375
01:50:18,230 --> 01:50:18,990
Nice.

2376
01:50:29,570 --> 01:50:31,670
I felt like I bullied the guy.

2377
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:37,980
He speaks English?

2378
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,380
His name is Maikuru.

2379
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,780
Why wouldn't he speak English?

2380
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:46,400
He speaks English?

2381
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:46,400
Why wouldn't he speak English?

2382
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:46,500
Why wouldn't he speak English?

2383
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:48,820
Why wouldn't he speak English?

2384
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:49,740
Okay, that's just saved.

2385
01:50:49,820 --> 01:50:50,240
That's all.

2386
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:51,000
That's all I wanted.

2387
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:54,400
Okay, that's just saved.

2388
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:54,400
That's all.

2389
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:54,400
That's all I wanted.

2390
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:58,380
Like, not only did I just punch it- take him down in one hit, but he flew, you know?

2391
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:01,920
He flew, one punch, man.

2392
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:04,220
Yeah, oh!

2393
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,620
Okay, okay.

2394
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:10,740
Let's see, how do we want to take out these guys.

2395
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,360
I think I get- I did get my coin back.

2396
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:12,820
Okay, perfect.

2397
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:14,560
Okay.

2398
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:15,900
Let's see- how do we want to take out these guys?

2399
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:16,120
So, I'm gonna switch to the other way around.

2400
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:16,120
I'm gonna save my coins.

2401
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:16,120
I'm gonna save my coins.

2402
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Just like one of my Japanese animes.

2403
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:28,900
How do I get out?

2404
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:31,100
So he just goes up and down?

2405
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:31,480
That's it?

2406
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:35,400
Oh yeah, their name is Mike, not Michael.

2407
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:36,400
Mike.

2408
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:37,800
Literally just Mike.

2409
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:40,020
Mike is Mike.

2410
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:45,080
That's a full legal name.

2411
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:45,640
Maikuru.

2412
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:46,820
Maikeru.

2413
01:51:58,570 --> 01:52:01,630
If I throw a coin all the way down here, will he notice it?

2414
01:52:04,230 --> 01:52:05,090
Where'd my coin go?

2415
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:07,870
Oh my gosh.

2416
01:52:07,950 --> 01:52:08,790
Okay, I got it.

2417
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,410
That would have been so sad.

2418
01:52:14,870 --> 01:52:16,250
I think I'm about to get noticed.

2419
01:52:23,630 --> 01:52:24,590
Oh shit.

2420
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:30,450
Wait, I just noticed that...

2421
01:52:30,450 --> 01:52:33,450
Oh my god, there's so many of them!

2422
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:37,970
The alert can go down.

2423
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:41,710
I just noticed the alert can go down, but...

2424
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:43,510
Does this one have three guys?

2425
01:52:43,830 --> 01:52:44,550
Oh my gosh.

2426
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:45,090
Hello?

2427
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:48,850
Yes, there's three guys here.

2428
01:52:51,190 --> 01:52:53,710
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk!

2429
01:52:57,750 --> 01:52:58,310
Got him.

2430
01:53:00,850 --> 01:53:01,410
And potty?

2431
01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:02,650
Yeah!

2432
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:06,170
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk!

2433
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:07,730
You need to go here.

2434
01:53:07,930 --> 01:53:09,010
You go, actually, over here.

2435
01:53:09,990 --> 01:53:10,590
Oh my gosh.

2436
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:12,350
Mike, you made such a mess!

2437
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:26,400
Yeah, okay.

2438
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:27,440
Alright.

2439
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:30,980
Let's just save again since I've taken out two guys.

2440
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:33,980
I know I'm a save scumming, but, you know...

2441
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:35,660
It's easier that way.

2442
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:47,630
I didn't realize he was right there.

2443
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:51,230
This is why we save scum, everybody!

2444
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:55,190
So, did you wash your hands before using the potty?

2445
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:01,880
Let's try and go for this guy.

2446
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,040
Yeah, that's right.

2447
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:13,600
Yeah, that's right.

2448
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:18,080
Oh, he's right there.

2449
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:21,140
Oh my gosh, he's right here.

2450
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:22,620
Oh, he's looking my direction.

2451
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:23,940
He's gonna turn around.

2452
01:54:31,070 --> 01:54:31,930
I'm sorry!

2453
01:54:31,930 --> 01:54:32,110
I'm sorry!

2454
01:54:32,410 --> 01:54:33,990
It's so funny.

2455
01:54:38,630 --> 01:54:40,310
They sound so pathetic, too.

2456
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:41,550
When you knock them out, they're like...

2457
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:46,210
Just...

2458
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:54,400
Dang it!

2459
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:56,740
I didn't think he'd turn around.

2460
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:00,520
Fine, take me out.

2461
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:01,300
Take me out.

2462
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:02,000
Just take me out.

2463
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:06,200
No.

2464
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:07,640
So, it is possible.

2465
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:10,580
But, like, how is it possible to end the alert?

2466
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:12,360
Maybe if it's like you go into a cutscene.

2467
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:13,640
Like, it has happened once.

2468
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:14,960
Just once.

2469
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,400
You know, where we went to a cutscene and it ended the alert.

2470
01:55:19,240 --> 01:55:19,560
But...

2471
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:19,920
I

2472
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:24,480
heard something.

2473
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:26,380
No, you didn't.

2474
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:27,480
Oh, wait.

2475
01:55:27,540 --> 01:55:28,640
He's gonna see his body, isn't he?

2476
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:31,700
Uh-oh.

2477
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:32,900
I think I messed up.

2478
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:35,540
Oh, no.

2479
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:36,340
Now they're both awake.

2480
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:36,560
Ah!

2481
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,020
Use my slingshot.

2482
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:53,360
Oh, that might be good.

2483
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:54,660
That is true.

2484
01:55:54,820 --> 01:55:55,720
They are one hit.

2485
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:56,860
Let's see if it works, actually.

2486
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:03,780
Actually, I think for this part, it might be better to...

2487
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:07,780
This guy is staring at me.

2488
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:08,560
He just doesn't realize.

2489
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:10,320
He doesn't even know.

2490
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:13,420
He doesn't even realize how much he's staring at me right now.

2491
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:18,660
Yeah, like that.

2492
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:19,600
Oh, but...

2493
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:21,660
Then how do I get that guy over there?

2494
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:22,580
Hmm...

2495
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:25,320
I think we have to go the other way.

2496
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,980
I think we have to go the other way.

2497
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:31,740
I'll try it, though.

2498
01:56:31,820 --> 01:56:32,440
Let's try it.

2499
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:33,020
Why not?

2500
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:36,940
Coin him?

2501
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:40,160
Oh, I guess you're right.

2502
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:47,240
Hey!

2503
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:48,040
Hey!

2504
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:49,100
A coin!

2505
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:49,780
Hey!

2506
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:51,620
A coin!

2507
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:53,140
Actually, I want to go back to the chloroform.

2508
01:56:57,620 --> 01:56:58,360
Thank you, sir.

2509
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:17,130
I've gotten pretty good at that, if I do say so myself.

2510
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:23,690
I've gotten pretty good at putting guys to sleep, if I do say so myself.

2511
01:57:24,350 --> 01:57:27,170
I can't tell if they can see behind these or not.

2512
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:29,010
Oh, no they can't.

2513
01:57:29,010 --> 01:57:29,390
Okay, cool.

2514
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:33,690
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2515
01:57:36,290 --> 01:57:37,170
And then, ah...

2516
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:38,070
Put you...

2517
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:38,990
All right, there.

2518
01:57:40,450 --> 01:57:40,830
Anything?

2519
01:57:41,070 --> 01:57:41,350
Nope.

2520
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:42,050
Anything?

2521
01:57:43,210 --> 01:57:43,590
Professionel.

2522
01:57:45,930 --> 01:57:46,310
Professionel.

2523
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:55,160
Oh, that's not what I wanted to do.

2524
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:56,580
I thought I was on the coin.

2525
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:58,180
Um...

2526
01:57:58,180 --> 01:58:00,520
Okay, so that room...

2527
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:02,660
Oh, there's a bathroom.

2528
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:04,680
Perfect.

2529
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:14,010
I think we're okay.

2530
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:18,030
Yippee!

2531
01:58:20,850 --> 01:58:22,070
We're all good!

2532
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:22,850
Yeah!

2533
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:24,570
Yeah!

2534
01:58:26,130 --> 01:58:26,890
Yeah!

2535
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:27,850
Yeah!

2536
01:58:29,050 --> 01:58:30,010
Who do you about?

2537
01:58:31,870 --> 01:58:37,590
Oh, you missed a lot?

2538
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:38,310
No worries!

2539
01:58:39,930 --> 01:58:41,070
We're doing it.

2540
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,250
We're doing it.

2541
01:58:43,730 --> 01:58:46,090
I think after this we have just one more chapter, right?

2542
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:46,450
So...

2543
01:58:46,450 --> 01:58:47,230
Wait, did I hit...

2544
01:58:47,230 --> 01:58:47,530
No!

2545
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:50,210
I didn't hit the room on the right.

2546
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:52,590
Where am I crazy?

2547
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:53,250
I can't remember...

2548
01:58:54,270 --> 01:58:55,150
Leud bones!

2549
01:58:55,590 --> 01:58:57,030
Thanks for 4 months!

2550
01:58:58,010 --> 01:58:58,730
Thank you!

2551
01:59:01,010 --> 01:59:02,310
All the way on the right, right?

2552
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:03,990
We didn't go to... here.

2553
01:59:08,150 --> 01:59:09,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2554
01:59:09,170 --> 01:59:09,570
These guys.

2555
01:59:12,990 --> 01:59:16,890
Yeah, there's a room over here.

2556
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,590
Let's coin them.

2557
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:37,420
I think if I get this guy well, too...

2558
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:40,320
Then I will be able to...

2559
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:44,160
Yeah,

2560
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:48,090
I'll be able to level up!

2561
01:59:49,710 --> 01:59:50,190
Yippee!

2562
01:59:52,230 --> 01:59:52,710
Yeah!

2563
01:59:52,710 --> 01:59:53,010
Yeah!

2564
01:59:56,270 --> 01:59:58,170
Light munitions expert.

2565
01:59:58,370 --> 01:59:59,650
Increase your maximum ammo.

2566
02:00:00,970 --> 02:00:03,010
Heavy munitions expert.

2567
02:00:06,010 --> 02:00:06,790
Heavy.

2568
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,260
I think heavy.

2569
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:18,260
I think heavy.

2570
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:21,800
What's in here?

2571
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,600
Some grenades!

2572
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:26,200
Much in time.

2573
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:29,220
Very cool.

2574
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:30,880
I'll take it.

2575
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:32,340
Oh!

2576
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:33,360
Bullets!

2577
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:33,840
Just kidding.

2578
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:38,400
Heavy, heavy, heavy.

2579
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:43,040
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

2580
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,340
Okay, well...

2581
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:46,460
At least we saw what was over here.

2582
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:48,460
Instead of ignoring that room.

2583
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:52,740
So, let's go to...

2584
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:54,220
All the way back.

2585
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:56,860
To all the way...

2586
02:00:57,860 --> 02:00:58,380
Back.

2587
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:05,680
Follow your dreams, Heavy Gunner Minto.

2588
02:01:06,440 --> 02:01:07,280
Thanks, Ham.

2589
02:01:09,140 --> 02:01:10,560
I'm Heavy Gunner.

2590
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:13,220
We'll save again real quick.

2591
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Dun, dun, dun, dun!

2592
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:18,360
Yeah!

2593
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:19,720
Hefty, hefty, hefty!

2594
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:21,400
Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy!

2595
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:26,840
Do you guys remember that commercial if you saw it?

2596
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:28,120
I think it was about...

2597
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:29,860
Toilet paper?

2598
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:30,960
Oh!

2599
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:33,200
I am Takuma Takagashi.

2600
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:35,540
Great Japanese samurai warrior.

2601
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:37,620
Alien of Shinra Rex.

2602
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:42,940
If you're the boss of those vessels, know that they couldn't take two punches.

2603
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:45,280
You insult Japanese culture.

2604
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:46,220
You die.

2605
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:47,220
Boy, my katana.

2606
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:48,400
I don't know how to feel that.

2607
02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:51,660
I'm going to show you what I think about your damn karate.

2608
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:52,460
Karate.

2609
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:54,980
Takuma Takagashi.

2610
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:56,020
Wait.

2611
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:57,480
Wait.

2612
02:01:58,160 --> 02:01:58,640
Tohu?

2613
02:01:58,800 --> 02:01:59,360
Oh my god.

2614
02:01:59,360 --> 02:01:59,680
Ouch!

2615
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:00,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2616
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:01,960
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2617
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:02,940
Oh my god!

2618
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:03,500
Wait a second.

2619
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:04,040
Hold on.

2620
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:07,280
Oh.

2621
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:08,540
Ouch!

2622
02:02:13,890 --> 02:02:16,050
I think I need to shoot him.

2623
02:02:18,930 --> 02:02:20,570
Unless he deflects my blades.

2624
02:02:22,130 --> 02:02:22,610
Ouch!

2625
02:02:22,930 --> 02:02:25,030
I'm going to die.

2626
02:02:25,530 --> 02:02:26,130
It's fine.

2627
02:02:26,130 --> 02:02:26,670
I'm going to die.

2628
02:02:26,810 --> 02:02:27,430
It's fine.

2629
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:27,810
It's fine.

2630
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:32,830
Maybe... Don't have that happen.

2631
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:33,230
Okay.

2632
02:02:34,150 --> 02:02:36,490
I feel like he'll deflect my bullets though, right?

2633
02:02:38,650 --> 02:02:41,070
I feel like he'll deflect my bullets or something.

2634
02:02:41,410 --> 02:02:43,830
But they gave me a lot of them.

2635
02:02:43,890 --> 02:02:44,230
I don't know.

2636
02:02:44,410 --> 02:02:45,190
Let's just try it.

2637
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:48,490
I didn't even get to have a single hit in, so...

2638
02:02:48,930 --> 02:02:50,830
It's probably fine to try.

2639
02:02:53,450 --> 02:02:55,050
It's probably fine to try at least.

2640
02:02:56,710 --> 02:02:57,350
Okay.

2641
02:02:57,350 --> 02:02:57,990
Okay.

2642
02:02:58,290 --> 02:02:59,750
Okay, okay, okay.

2643
02:03:00,450 --> 02:03:01,410
Oh, nevermind.

2644
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:02,050
Ouch!

2645
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:14,260
He's healing!

2646
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:15,800
Wait, was he healing himself?

2647
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:18,400
Oh my gosh.

2648
02:03:18,580 --> 02:03:19,520
This is not good.

2649
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:30,700
Don't come any closer!

2650
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:32,540
You scared me.

2651
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,020
Stop running around!

2652
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:36,040
Oh, that was good.

2653
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:36,580
That was good.

2654
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:38,220
That was good.

2655
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:45,050
Okay.

2656
02:03:45,170 --> 02:03:45,990
Just barely missed.

2657
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:49,410
Ouch!

2658
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:53,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2659
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:58,620
Okay.

2660
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:05,980
No worries.

2661
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:07,340
Actually, I'm going to...

2662
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:08,160
Let's do this real quick.

2663
02:04:10,740 --> 02:04:12,060
We're going to...

2664
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:13,780
Oops.

2665
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:16,360
Use that and have...

2666
02:04:16,380 --> 02:04:17,820
this up and then re-save.

2667
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:20,400
Just like that.

2668
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:22,880
Does the roll avoid the strikes?

2669
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:24,500
I do not know.

2670
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:27,400
There will be blood!

2671
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:30,180
Ouch,

2672
02:04:33,420 --> 02:04:34,060
ouch, ouch, ouch.

2673
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:39,220
That was close.

2674
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:48,770
Ouch!

2675
02:04:48,770 --> 02:04:49,550
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2676
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:57,010
Every time I shoot him, he does the...

2677
02:04:57,870 --> 02:05:00,390
He does the blade attack.

2678
02:05:01,910 --> 02:05:04,610
So maybe I can't do it multiple times or else I will...

2679
02:05:05,430 --> 02:05:06,330
Oh gosh!

2680
02:05:07,510 --> 02:05:08,850
He still even got me.

2681
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:18,140
Ah!

2682
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:19,900
Uh-oh.

2683
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:26,570
What is he doing?

2684
02:05:27,130 --> 02:05:28,170
He's like...

2685
02:05:35,030 --> 02:05:35,430
He's like...

2686
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:35,750
What?!

2687
02:05:36,390 --> 02:05:37,630
This is so...

2688
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:38,890
messed...

2689
02:05:39,430 --> 02:05:39,830
up!

2690
02:05:51,980 --> 02:05:53,200
Oh, I'm going to die!

2691
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:53,720
I'm going to die!

2692
02:05:53,780 --> 02:05:54,200
I'm going to die!

2693
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:56,300
I'm going to die!

2694
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:01,200
He does heal, right?

2695
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:02,160
He does heal, yeah.

2696
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:04,020
Oh, this one's hard!

2697
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:04,760
Because the...

2698
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:05,700
What the...

2699
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:07,480
What's that metal at the bottom?

2700
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:09,820
I just noticed it.

2701
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:10,400
Founder?

2702
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:12,980
Before his head is apart.

2703
02:06:15,020 --> 02:06:15,460
Oh...

2704
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:17,400
Yeah, he's...

2705
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:19,040
Can you roll under the fans?

2706
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:19,880
Okay, let's try it.

2707
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,260
Yeah, I forgot to roll.

2708
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:22,160
I always forget to roll.

2709
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:26,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2710
02:06:26,140 --> 02:06:26,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2711
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:26,900
He's a...

2712
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:34,940
Oh, I missed.

2713
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:40,690
What the hell is this head part?

2714
02:06:40,930 --> 02:06:42,390
You piece...

2715
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:44,250
What is this?

2716
02:06:45,770 --> 02:06:46,490
Ugh!

2717
02:06:52,510 --> 02:06:53,950
Oh my god!

2718
02:06:54,090 --> 02:06:54,930
I almost...

2719
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:55,770
Please...

2720
02:06:57,330 --> 02:06:58,050
Okay.

2721
02:06:58,230 --> 02:06:59,190
Oh shoot!

2722
02:07:06,380 --> 02:07:10,260
I can't tell where my hit bar is at all, you guys!

2723
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:11,080
This sucks!

2724
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:13,480
Not with these things, they suck!

2725
02:07:13,820 --> 02:07:14,540
Okay, hold on.

2726
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:16,040
When he does it again...

2727
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:18,340
Oh my god...

2728
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:20,060
It's such a... okay.

2729
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:22,680
I guess I... can?

2730
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:26,420
The shadows?

2731
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:28,780
Yeah, but the shadows also hit my head!

2732
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:29,820
That's the issue.

2733
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:33,800
Okay.

2734
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:34,580
Okay, okay.

2735
02:07:39,690 --> 02:07:42,330
I don't think I'm gonna have fun with this fight.

2736
02:07:42,910 --> 02:07:44,130
I'm just gonna say that.

2737
02:07:52,580 --> 02:07:53,060
You

2738
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:04,510
bitch!

2739
02:08:09,710 --> 02:08:12,350
And then every time... oh, come on.

2740
02:08:12,390 --> 02:08:13,310
No, I'm just gonna die.

2741
02:08:13,710 --> 02:08:15,290
Every time he...

2742
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:18,690
Hits... he does a slash on me.

2743
02:08:18,750 --> 02:08:20,270
I have to... I have to bandage.

2744
02:08:22,510 --> 02:08:23,550
Every time.

2745
02:08:23,690 --> 02:08:24,210
Every time.

2746
02:08:30,230 --> 02:08:30,750
Okay.

2747
02:08:32,430 --> 02:08:33,210
Okay, okay.

2748
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:55,780
Okay.

2749
02:08:55,780 --> 02:08:56,300
Okay.

2750
02:08:56,600 --> 02:09:00,260
We're gonna do slow and steady as we can.

2751
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:04,320
I think... is the best... course of action for this.

2752
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:07,560
I don't... he runs around too much for me to grenade him.

2753
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:11,280
I think shooting is my only option.

2754
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:15,460
Even... he's too fast for me to rocket him.

2755
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:18,560
Also... I don't think there's any point to me rocketing him.

2756
02:09:18,780 --> 02:09:20,860
Because... I only have two.

2757
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:24,360
So...

2758
02:09:25,940 --> 02:09:27,420
Yeah, we'll just go with what we got.

2759
02:09:30,700 --> 02:09:30,920
Okay.

2760
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:45,340
Piece of...

2761
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:56,480
I

2762
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:07,820
have to reload eventually.

2763
02:10:08,180 --> 02:10:12,100
I should've never... I should've gotten the reload thing, you guys.

2764
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:14,900
I should've...

2765
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:19,060
I should've gotten the reload thing.

2766
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:23,180
The automatically reloads.

2767
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:26,280
I hate this!

2768
02:10:26,420 --> 02:10:28,400
If you get too close to him, everything sucks!

2769
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:30,120
Everything is bad!

2770
02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:35,080
Oh my god.

2771
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:35,400
Wait.

2772
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:44,120
I was reloading!

2773
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:44,840
I couldn't move!

2774
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:49,440
Oh, this is so...

2775
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:51,900
This fight is already so awful annoying.

2776
02:10:52,740 --> 02:10:53,940
Oh my god.

2777
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:55,780
This is already so annoying.

2778
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:03,240
I really... I will try grenading him, but I really think he's too fast for it.

2779
02:11:03,660 --> 02:11:04,780
I really...

2780
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:05,820
Oh, well.

2781
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:10,260
That was...

2782
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:11,940
Great.

2783
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:13,200
Oh my god.

2784
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:14,820
I... I hate...

2785
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:17,960
I hate these fans.

2786
02:11:18,080 --> 02:11:19,420
I can't get... Okay, hold on.

2787
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:20,700
See?

2788
02:11:20,860 --> 02:11:23,580
Why did that not hit me, but before hit me?

2789
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:25,980
Why did that one not hit me?

2790
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:27,980
But that one hit me!

2791
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:29,320
I don't understand!

2792
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:32,980
The hitbox is so weird!

2793
02:11:40,290 --> 02:11:42,690
The hitbox is so weird!

2794
02:11:42,970 --> 02:11:44,770
Do I just have to roll every time?

2795
02:11:44,850 --> 02:11:47,230
But rolling also... Like, I can't...

2796
02:11:47,910 --> 02:11:48,430
See?

2797
02:11:48,510 --> 02:11:48,690
Okay.

2798
02:11:48,730 --> 02:11:48,910
See?

2799
02:11:48,970 --> 02:11:49,170
Okay.

2800
02:11:49,190 --> 02:11:49,970
If I spam...

2801
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:50,490
V?

2802
02:11:52,210 --> 02:11:53,250
Do you hear that?

2803
02:11:54,210 --> 02:11:56,590
That's how little... I can roll.

2804
02:12:00,490 --> 02:12:03,470
Like, it's not like a very consistent... There's a... There's a cooldown.

2805
02:12:05,550 --> 02:12:08,210
So, it's... It's not as easy...

2806
02:12:09,650 --> 02:12:11,950
as... as just like, spamming roll.

2807
02:12:12,590 --> 02:12:13,110
Huh?

2808
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:24,370
Thank you for watching!

2809
02:12:30,430 --> 02:12:31,410
What the?

2810
02:12:31,950 --> 02:12:36,450
He... He sliced my grenade.

2811
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:43,670
He sliced my grenade.

2812
02:13:19,540 --> 02:13:27,340
I have to be in a... good, like... Oh my god, you beast!

2813
02:13:30,440 --> 02:13:35,900
Oh my god, even if I just get, like, two feet away from him, it's so unfair.

2814
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:36,800
Oh.

2815
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:38,220
Oh, I

2816
02:13:59,750 --> 02:14:01,150
need to reload.

2817
02:14:01,590 --> 02:14:03,570
I need to reload, but I can't get close to him.

2818
02:14:03,710 --> 02:14:05,150
I need to reload when he heals.

2819
02:14:05,550 --> 02:14:06,030
Basically.

2820
02:14:08,270 --> 02:14:08,750
Oh!

2821
02:14:09,430 --> 02:14:09,910
Ah!

2822
02:14:14,350 --> 02:14:16,270
Oh my gosh, my finger placement!

2823
02:14:17,090 --> 02:14:17,570
Ah!

2824
02:14:22,660 --> 02:14:25,400
Are you kidding me?

2825
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:27,680
Right now?

2826
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:29,140
Are you for real?

2827
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:29,680
For real?

2828
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:30,500
Are you for real?

2829
02:14:32,860 --> 02:14:34,280
This is the worst.

2830
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:34,880
This is the worst.

2831
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:35,840
That was just the worst.

2832
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:37,640
This is the worst!

2833
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:40,800
Nooo!

2834
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:51,160
Grenade him when he heals, maybe.

2835
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:52,200
Oh, maybe.

2836
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:55,420
Oh my gosh.

2837
02:14:56,020 --> 02:15:00,480
This is where people are just like, when are you gonna play, like, Souls games?

2838
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:03,140
This is why I'll never play them!

2839
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:06,800
Oh my gosh!

2840
02:15:23,710 --> 02:15:24,230
Oh

2841
02:15:45,860 --> 02:15:46,380
gosh!

2842
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:52,980
I forgot to change into the grenade when he was healing.

2843
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:03,180
You asshole!

2844
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:04,800
You are such an asshole!

2845
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:07,800
I'm going to bleed out.

2846
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:14,280
It

2847
02:16:20,930 --> 02:16:21,750
still didn't work!

2848
02:16:22,690 --> 02:16:24,290
Okay, it doesn't work, you guys.

2849
02:16:24,350 --> 02:16:24,870
It doesn't work.

2850
02:16:24,910 --> 02:16:25,390
It doesn't work.

2851
02:16:25,450 --> 02:16:25,930
It doesn't work.

2852
02:16:26,270 --> 02:16:27,070
It doesn't work.

2853
02:16:27,270 --> 02:16:28,290
It doesn't work ever!

2854
02:16:37,510 --> 02:16:39,190
He's already at full health.

2855
02:16:39,510 --> 02:16:41,610
He's already at full health, man.

2856
02:16:42,370 --> 02:16:44,110
He's already at full health.

2857
02:16:46,710 --> 02:16:48,650
This is so messed up.

2858
02:16:50,630 --> 02:16:52,210
This is so messed up.

2859
02:16:57,450 --> 02:16:57,910
Okay.

2860
02:16:59,070 --> 02:16:59,670
I'll show you guys.

2861
02:16:59,730 --> 02:17:01,250
Because rockets are really slow.

2862
02:17:01,530 --> 02:17:02,010
I really...

2863
02:17:02,010 --> 02:17:03,310
And I only have two of them.

2864
02:17:03,410 --> 02:17:03,910
I really...

2865
02:17:03,910 --> 02:17:06,570
You guys keep saying rockets, but I don't think it's going to be worth it.

2866
02:17:07,010 --> 02:17:08,970
I don't think it's going to be worth it.

2867
02:17:12,610 --> 02:17:13,750
Rockets are hella slow.

2868
02:17:13,970 --> 02:17:15,090
And this guy is zooming.

2869
02:17:26,980 --> 02:17:28,880
I can't get close enough to punch him.

2870
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:30,300
Oh, see?

2871
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:31,160
He sliced it!

2872
02:17:31,220 --> 02:17:31,880
Okay, we...

2873
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:32,400
That's it.

2874
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:32,920
That's it.

2875
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:33,440
We know.

2876
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:33,760
We know.

2877
02:17:34,380 --> 02:17:36,500
He sliced the rocket, you guys.

2878
02:17:36,620 --> 02:17:37,540
We can't do rockets.

2879
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:42,860
So, if I see another rocket suggestion in the chat, I'm going to freak out.

2880
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:45,260
I'm going to throw up all over my laptop.

2881
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:48,280
And I'm just going to... I'm just going to...

2882
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:51,300
I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to throw...

2883
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:53,100
I'm going to throw up all over my laptop.

2884
02:17:57,220 --> 02:17:57,700
Oops.

2885
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:08,030
I didn't mean that.

2886
02:18:09,010 --> 02:18:11,150
I got... I got scared.

2887
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:24,280
Oh, shit.

2888
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:25,300
I meant to shoot him.

2889
02:18:46,410 --> 02:18:46,810
Concentrating.

2890
02:18:46,810 --> 02:18:47,210
Concentrating.

2891
02:18:47,730 --> 02:18:48,130
Concentrating.

2892
02:18:49,470 --> 02:18:50,550
I need to recharge.

2893
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:13,820
Shit.

2894
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:14,240
Shit.

2895
02:19:14,340 --> 02:19:14,580
Shit.

2896
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:14,840
Shit.

2897
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:14,920
Shit.

2898
02:19:15,060 --> 02:19:15,060
Shit.

2899
02:19:15,060 --> 02:19:15,120
Shit.

2900
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:15,200
Shit.

2901
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:24,120
We're just running... We're both like...

2902
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:26,240
Running around like gerbils right now.

2903
02:19:33,220 --> 02:19:35,240
Don't even be like...

2904
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:36,320
Shit.

2905
02:19:36,380 --> 02:19:37,280
I didn't mean to reload.

2906
02:19:43,020 --> 02:19:44,380
I don't have any more health.

2907
02:19:45,440 --> 02:19:46,720
I don't have any more health.

2908
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:47,540
I don't have any more health.

2909
02:19:54,130 --> 02:19:55,550
I have to... I have to let this heal.

2910
02:19:55,630 --> 02:19:56,310
I have to let this heal.

2911
02:19:56,910 --> 02:19:58,570
Before I, like, take any more risks.

2912
02:19:58,830 --> 02:19:59,330
You know?

2913
02:20:00,030 --> 02:20:00,930
He's so fast.

2914
02:20:01,370 --> 02:20:03,390
This isn't even Phase 2, you know?

2915
02:20:03,510 --> 02:20:05,070
Like, this is just regular...

2916
02:20:05,070 --> 02:20:05,450
Oh, shit.

2917
02:20:05,550 --> 02:20:05,710
Okay.

2918
02:20:07,390 --> 02:20:07,750
Okay.

2919
02:20:08,250 --> 02:20:09,370
I have to heal more.

2920
02:20:09,470 --> 02:20:09,990
I have to heal more.

2921
02:20:10,070 --> 02:20:10,570
I have to heal more.

2922
02:20:11,110 --> 02:20:12,570
But I can't let him heal, you know?

2923
02:20:13,210 --> 02:20:16,190
If he starts healing, I gotta take him... I gotta take him out.

2924
02:20:17,230 --> 02:20:18,050
Slow and steady.

2925
02:20:22,230 --> 02:20:23,130
Oh my god.

2926
02:20:23,230 --> 02:20:23,470
No.

2927
02:20:30,750 --> 02:20:31,470
Stop it!

2928
02:20:32,110 --> 02:20:33,290
Are you kidding me?

2929
02:20:35,250 --> 02:20:35,770
Come

2930
02:20:43,860 --> 02:20:44,280
on!

2931
02:20:44,820 --> 02:20:46,260
That's not even fair!

2932
02:20:47,320 --> 02:20:48,720
That's so unfair!

2933
02:21:15,150 --> 02:21:18,230
He should have a cooldown as well on, like, the...

2934
02:21:19,130 --> 02:21:20,170
On him...

2935
02:21:21,630 --> 02:21:22,370
What's it called?

2936
02:21:23,610 --> 02:21:24,950
Him doing the slashes.

2937
02:21:25,030 --> 02:21:26,690
Not this slash, but the...

2938
02:21:27,490 --> 02:21:29,550
Like, the ones when he's close to you.

2939
02:21:29,610 --> 02:21:30,910
Like, the fact that he can just...

2940
02:21:31,830 --> 02:21:33,610
Infinitely slash you...

2941
02:21:33,610 --> 02:21:36,510
Is very unfair, I think.

2942
02:21:38,410 --> 02:21:42,830
And there does... It does, like, insane damage, so it's like, okay...

2943
02:21:42,830 --> 02:21:45,310
I guess I'll just die at that point.

2944
02:21:45,430 --> 02:21:46,050
For real.

2945
02:21:47,050 --> 02:21:48,930
Like, there's not even a point...

2946
02:21:49,730 --> 02:21:51,750
To trying at that rate.

2947
02:21:54,310 --> 02:21:54,790
See?

2948
02:21:56,350 --> 02:21:59,230
And then I just get... I get hit again, and I...

2949
02:21:59,230 --> 02:22:00,750
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

2950
02:22:00,750 --> 02:22:07,350
I'm just

2951
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:16,110
gonna...

2952
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:17,690
Is it two free shots at the...

2953
02:22:17,690 --> 02:22:19,650
I think it's really just more like one, right?

2954
02:22:20,370 --> 02:22:21,450
Okay, there you go.

2955
02:22:21,570 --> 02:22:22,050
I guess...

2956
02:22:22,490 --> 02:22:23,530
I guess that's two.

2957
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:24,230
Oh, whoops.

2958
02:22:24,310 --> 02:22:25,510
I thought I was facing up.

2959
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:35,440
But there's, like, no downside to him doing his little blade.

2960
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:37,800
Ah, shit.

2961
02:22:38,180 --> 02:22:39,800
See, yeah, you can only get one here.

2962
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:41,660
Oh, that was close!

2963
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:44,940
Yeah, there's no point in doing a...

2964
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:46,560
Double shot there.

2965
02:22:47,480 --> 02:22:48,680
Because I'll always get hit.

2966
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:50,000
Yeah.

2967
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:52,380
He counters so fast.

2968
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:05,720
He counters so fast.

2969
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:17,920
Oh,

2970
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:24,480
I'm bleeding out.

2971
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:24,960
I'm bleeding out.

2972
02:23:25,100 --> 02:23:27,660
I only

2973
02:23:30,860 --> 02:23:31,700
have one left.

2974
02:23:47,060 --> 02:23:51,000
I tried to press up.

2975
02:23:51,900 --> 02:23:53,120
My finger slipped, though.

2976
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:55,000
There's an attempt.

2977
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:56,760
There was...

2978
02:23:56,760 --> 02:23:57,100
Oh.

2979
02:23:57,500 --> 02:23:59,840
There was an attempt.

2980
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:02,060
Oh my god, he's healed so much, though.

2981
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:04,640
He's healed so much, though.

2982
02:24:04,820 --> 02:24:05,420
Oh my god!

2983
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:05,800
No!

2984
02:24:06,760 --> 02:24:08,140
I'm stressing, you guys.

2985
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:08,920
I'm panicking.

2986
02:24:08,980 --> 02:24:09,580
I'm panicking.

2987
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:10,640
And it's making me throw.

2988
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:14,820
I'm panicking.

2989
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:27,880
The può territories...

2990
02:24:27,880 --> 02:24:29,800
Children, children, children...

2991
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:32,400
That's...

2992
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:41,010
That's...

2993
02:26:41,590 --> 02:26:41,790
Ah!

2994
02:26:41,790 --> 02:26:42,370
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

2995
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:53,310
Ah!

2996
02:26:53,310 --> 02:26:53,710
Shit, shit, shit.

2997
02:26:55,870 --> 02:26:56,490
Don't get me, please.

2998
02:26:59,250 --> 02:27:00,270
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2999
02:27:00,570 --> 02:27:01,070
Please, please, please.

3000
02:27:21,370 --> 02:27:22,530
It is not my honor.

3001
02:27:23,270 --> 02:27:23,990
Just die.

3002
02:27:26,710 --> 02:27:27,430
Boss defeated.

3003
02:27:27,850 --> 02:27:28,550
Boss defeated.

3004
02:27:33,230 --> 02:27:34,390
Ah, I beat him.

3005
02:27:34,550 --> 02:27:36,190
Look at all my bullets all over the place.

3006
02:27:36,210 --> 02:27:37,110
Here, I'm going to heal real quick.

3007
02:27:37,210 --> 02:27:39,970
I'm also going to get some tea because I do be shaking.

3008
02:27:40,290 --> 02:27:41,010
Give me one second.

3009
02:27:44,290 --> 02:27:47,150
I don't think the cake was good breakfast, you guys.

3010
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:55,860
You're absurd.

3011
02:28:01,720 --> 02:28:03,700
The only other food I have...

3012
02:28:03,700 --> 02:28:06,320
The only other food I have here are some...

3013
02:28:09,560 --> 02:28:10,120
Pretz.

3014
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:12,180
They are...

3015
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:14,140
What's it called?

3016
02:28:14,420 --> 02:28:15,120
They are...

3017
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:19,100
Sweet potato flavored pretz.

3018
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:24,040
So, I will eat some of those.

3019
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:30,860
I don't want anything sweet right now, though.

3020
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:34,920
Did the rockets help?

3021
02:28:35,620 --> 02:28:35,960
No.

3022
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:41,740
The corn pretz?

3023
02:28:42,660 --> 02:28:43,260
Oh, yeah.

3024
02:28:44,340 --> 02:28:45,500
I've had the corn pretz.

3025
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:50,540
I've got to go around.

3026
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:53,340
Bam, bam, bam.

3027
02:28:56,180 --> 02:28:57,260
How do I get this box?

3028
02:28:58,280 --> 02:28:59,100
How do I get there?

3029
02:29:00,060 --> 02:29:01,060
How do I get to there?

3030
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:02,480
Hmm.

3031
02:29:03,720 --> 02:29:04,560
How do I get there?

3032
02:29:06,660 --> 02:29:06,980
Save?

3033
02:29:07,060 --> 02:29:09,240
Oh, it's saved after I beat him, did it not?

3034
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:12,660
It's saved.

3035
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:14,720
I'll save just to make you guys feel better.

3036
02:29:14,820 --> 02:29:16,440
But I did save once I...

3037
02:29:18,420 --> 02:29:19,500
Once I beat the boss.

3038
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,660
But I'll save to make you guys feel better.

3039
02:29:29,110 --> 02:29:30,070
Actually, can I go through here?

3040
02:29:30,250 --> 02:29:30,670
Oh, I can.

3041
02:29:31,830 --> 02:29:32,550
There we go.

3042
02:29:35,730 --> 02:29:36,690
Yeah, there we go.

3043
02:29:39,730 --> 02:29:40,910
That works even better.

3044
02:29:42,890 --> 02:29:45,090
Better save than sorry.

3045
02:29:45,430 --> 02:29:47,170
Ho, ho, ho, ho, hoi, hoi, hoi.

3046
02:29:47,550 --> 02:29:50,650
Oh, I also want to get back my...

3047
02:29:50,650 --> 02:29:52,190
Oh, there we go.

3048
02:29:56,530 --> 02:29:58,390
How do I get that?

3049
02:30:11,140 --> 02:30:13,120
Hmm, do I roll over here?

3050
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:15,800
Is that a ladder right there, even?

3051
02:30:23,180 --> 02:30:26,580
This is maybe a little extreme, but...

3052
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:32,220
Just kidding?

3053
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:35,480
Just kidding?

3054
02:30:39,160 --> 02:30:39,820
Hmm...

3055
02:30:45,520 --> 02:30:46,440
Mike!

3056
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:50,420
You scared me.

3057
02:30:50,460 --> 02:30:51,180
Yeah.

3058
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:52,360
It's me, Mike.

3059
02:30:54,980 --> 02:30:55,560
Aww.

3060
02:31:00,440 --> 02:31:01,600
What?

3061
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:16,300
You need some help?

3062
02:31:16,740 --> 02:31:18,440
Nah, I'm going to the rooftop.

3063
02:31:19,140 --> 02:31:19,880
Almost there.

3064
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,000
Just take an elevator up a floor.

3065
02:31:22,140 --> 02:31:22,360
Okay.

3066
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:22,880
I know.

3067
02:31:22,940 --> 02:31:25,440
I was just... exploring a little.

3068
02:31:25,660 --> 02:31:25,860
Yeah.

3069
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:28,580
Anyway, if you need any help, come see me.

3070
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:29,700
I'll be around.

3071
02:31:30,180 --> 02:31:30,860
Okay, Mike.

3072
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:31,780
See you later.

3073
02:31:31,900 --> 02:31:32,360
See you, Mike.

3074
02:31:32,540 --> 02:31:32,680
Yup.

3075
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:33,440
Toodaloo.

3076
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:34,560
Toodaloo!

3077
02:31:37,360 --> 02:31:38,060
Oh, Mike.

3078
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:39,520
Do you have a key card?

3079
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:42,040
Can you open this door for me, Mike?

3080
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:42,360
Wait.

3081
02:31:45,580 --> 02:31:46,980
Oh, um...

3082
02:31:50,680 --> 02:31:51,420
Mike.

3083
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:04,340
Um...

3084
02:32:06,600 --> 02:32:08,240
Try seducing him.

3085
02:32:08,480 --> 02:32:09,220
Mike.

3086
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:10,880
Oh, Mike.

3087
02:32:11,020 --> 02:32:14,540
Your strong muscles and your big brain.

3088
02:32:15,490 --> 02:32:18,100
Can you open this door for me, big guy?

3089
02:32:21,610 --> 02:32:23,480
Souls gamer mental arc soon.

3090
02:32:23,960 --> 02:32:24,700
Mmm...

3091
02:32:24,700 --> 02:32:24,880
Isn't...

3092
02:32:25,480 --> 02:32:27,600
Isn't Bloodborne a Souls-like?

3093
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:33,120
Do I just go back to the elevator or...?

3094
02:32:37,460 --> 02:32:38,020
Yes.

3095
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:39,340
Oh, I'm boned.

3096
02:32:40,380 --> 02:32:41,500
I'm so screwed.

3097
02:32:41,560 --> 02:32:41,900
Wait.

3098
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:45,700
I'm so screwed, you guys.

3099
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:46,640
Oh!

3100
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:49,360
Ah!

3101
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:53,160
I finally went out to the rooftop.

3102
02:32:53,380 --> 02:32:53,520
Yeah!

3103
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:57,080
As I stepped out, I observed details that would be missed.

3104
02:32:58,120 --> 02:32:58,960
Oh, yeah.

3105
02:32:59,180 --> 02:33:03,320
But to a trained eye like mine, nothing ever goes unnoticed.

3106
02:33:03,880 --> 02:33:04,480
I read mine as Mike.

3107
02:33:04,480 --> 02:33:07,540
First off, there was a communication antenna to my right.

3108
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:08,480
Beep, beep.

3109
02:33:08,880 --> 02:33:09,480
Right?

3110
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:10,860
You mean on the left?

3111
02:33:11,020 --> 02:33:12,020
No, to my right.

3112
02:33:12,220 --> 02:33:14,100
I was looking south, so your left is my right.

3113
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:14,440
Yeah.

3114
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:15,320
Of course.

3115
02:33:15,460 --> 02:33:15,920
Continue.

3116
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:16,380
Yeah.

3117
02:33:16,420 --> 02:33:16,820
Dummy.

3118
02:33:16,820 --> 02:33:17,680
Another key detail.

3119
02:33:18,040 --> 02:33:18,960
Four guards!

3120
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:19,740
There were four guards.

3121
02:33:20,840 --> 02:33:21,440
Oh!

3122
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:22,120
Oh!

3123
02:33:22,120 --> 02:33:23,440
And they were smoking.

3124
02:33:23,860 --> 02:33:24,180
Oh.

3125
02:33:24,320 --> 02:33:24,920
Ah!

3126
02:33:26,120 --> 02:33:26,720
Well...

3127
02:33:26,720 --> 02:33:27,060
Oh!

3128
02:33:27,060 --> 02:33:29,140
Well, well, well...

3129
02:33:29,140 --> 02:33:30,060
Jesse, why are you talking?

3130
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:31,160
What the fuck do we have here?

3131
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:32,080
Oh, no.

3132
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:33,780
Hands up!

3133
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:37,680
You have no fucking idea who I am, do you?

3134
02:33:37,980 --> 02:33:39,420
Who the hell are you, scumbag?

3135
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:43,980
I'm the man who's going to shove my boot in your asses so deep...

3136
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:45,240
We're back to Sergeant Jesse.

3137
02:33:45,340 --> 02:33:46,540
...that you'll all be shitting leather for a month!

3138
02:33:46,620 --> 02:33:47,720
Well, I hope we're back to Sergeant Jesse.

3139
02:33:47,740 --> 02:33:48,580
I'm a fucking work inspector.

3140
02:33:48,580 --> 02:33:48,940
Oh!

3141
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:49,680
We're the work inspector!

3142
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:50,980
Military Internal Affairs!

3143
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:52,480
What?

3144
02:33:52,800 --> 02:33:53,500
Oh, my God!

3145
02:33:53,640 --> 02:33:54,440
Oh, my God!

3146
02:33:54,580 --> 02:33:56,100
So, how the fuck is it possible...

3147
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:57,180
Osha.

3148
02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:57,300
Osha's here.

3149
02:33:57,300 --> 02:34:01,020
...that a goddamn gentleman like me, dressed as a mere civilian...

3150
02:34:01,020 --> 02:34:04,720
...really strolled around the whole fucking building?

3151
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:06,020
I'll tell you how.

3152
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:14,640
Because some inept guards decided that instead of being at their posts, they slithered up to the rooftop to hide, smoke, and spew scum.

3153
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:15,760
Spew scum?

3154
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:17,120
It's our five minutes off, sir.

3155
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:19,080
Are you kidding me, soldier?

3156
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:20,120
No, sir.

3157
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:21,960
There's no five minutes off as a soldier!

3158
02:34:22,780 --> 02:34:23,320
Mike, sir.

3159
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:23,960
Mike!

3160
02:34:23,980 --> 02:34:26,080
Listen to me carefully, scumbag Mike.

3161
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:27,100
I've been...

3162
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:27,960
Scumbag Mike.

3163
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:28,880
...to the General himself.

3164
02:34:29,260 --> 02:34:32,320
He is pissed off with all the soldiers in this building.

3165
02:34:32,540 --> 02:34:37,000
And I have his permission to ensure each one of you are pissed off.

3166
02:34:37,180 --> 02:34:42,140
I just have to make a little fucking check mark, and your precious fucking leave...

3167
02:34:42,140 --> 02:34:43,860
He's pissed off, so they get pissed on?

3168
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:46,180
...is never ending hell of cleaning latrines and wiping piss.

3169
02:34:46,380 --> 02:34:46,580
No!

3170
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:50,020
So, don't piss me off.

3171
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:53,500
Do I make myself clear, scumbag Mike?

3172
02:34:54,060 --> 02:34:55,300
Crystal clear, sir.

3173
02:34:55,460 --> 02:34:56,060
Check mark.

3174
02:34:56,060 --> 02:34:56,600
What are you chatting here?

3175
02:34:56,820 --> 02:34:57,220
Blah.

3176
02:34:57,320 --> 02:34:57,720
Blah.

3177
02:34:57,900 --> 02:34:58,300
Blah.

3178
02:34:58,840 --> 02:34:59,800
Gossiping like schoolgirls.

3179
02:34:59,800 --> 02:35:00,760
I think this game loves pee.

3180
02:35:01,140 --> 02:35:01,540
Disgusting.

3181
02:35:01,540 --> 02:35:02,500
Just as much as you guys do.

3182
02:35:02,720 --> 02:35:04,960
Imagine if I was a spy or a prisoner...

3183
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:06,060
This guy is an improv...

3184
02:35:06,060 --> 02:35:06,980
...who managed to obtain critical information.

3185
02:35:06,980 --> 02:35:07,320
...crazy man.

3186
02:35:07,560 --> 02:35:12,480
...and I was pretending to be a work inspector in order to steal a helicopter and escape.

3187
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:15,020
What do you think would happen, scumbag Mike?

3188
02:35:15,380 --> 02:35:18,260
Sir, it would be a non-authorized take-off...

3189
02:35:18,260 --> 02:35:18,520
Yes.

3190
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:20,400
...and it would be shot down by the surface-to-air missiles.

3191
02:35:20,620 --> 02:35:20,960
Oh.

3192
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:21,660
And you think he couldn't avoid it?

3193
02:35:21,660 --> 02:35:23,120
No, not the surface-to-air missiles.

3194
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:25,900
Only if he disabled the communication with the missiles, sir.

3195
02:35:26,060 --> 02:35:26,180
Ah.

3196
02:35:26,300 --> 02:35:26,920
I see.

3197
02:35:27,640 --> 02:35:28,900
And how would he do that?

3198
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:32,080
Sir, disabling the communication antenna...

3199
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:33,160
I see.

3200
02:35:33,620 --> 02:35:34,720
...the communication with all surface-to-air missile batteries.

3201
02:35:34,840 --> 02:35:35,240
Uh-huh.

3202
02:35:35,300 --> 02:35:36,280
And he just gets away.

3203
02:35:36,680 --> 02:35:39,160
What kind of shitty security is that?

3204
02:35:39,420 --> 02:35:39,940
That's it.

3205
02:35:39,980 --> 02:35:41,760
Mike just explained the whole story.

3206
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:42,100
It's all going into my report.

3207
02:35:42,500 --> 02:35:43,740
Heads are going to roll.

3208
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:44,940
Please, sir.

3209
02:35:45,140 --> 02:35:46,260
Don't rescind our leave.

3210
02:35:46,460 --> 02:35:48,180
We have children waiting for us.

3211
02:35:48,480 --> 02:35:48,860
Fuck.

3212
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:50,420
You have children?

3213
02:35:50,420 --> 02:35:51,860
I'm just going back to your house and children.

3214
02:35:51,980 --> 02:35:52,260
And you're smoking?

3215
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:55,080
You call yourself a father, scumbag Mike?

3216
02:35:55,300 --> 02:35:55,840
Scumbag Mike.

3217
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:56,000
I have children.

3218
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:56,040
Scumbag Mike.

3219
02:35:56,040 --> 02:35:57,780
I have good reason to keep you from your kids.

3220
02:35:57,920 --> 02:35:58,400
Shut up.

3221
02:35:58,520 --> 02:35:58,780
No.

3222
02:35:58,860 --> 02:35:59,200
Please.

3223
02:35:59,460 --> 02:36:00,440
I'll give up smoking.

3224
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:01,440
I swear to God.

3225
02:36:01,660 --> 02:36:02,620
Swear to me.

3226
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:03,160
I swear.

3227
02:36:03,240 --> 02:36:03,660
I swear.

3228
02:36:04,040 --> 02:36:05,360
I'm magnanimous.

3229
02:36:05,420 --> 02:36:07,160
I will turn on my eyes...

3230
02:36:07,160 --> 02:36:07,460
Magnanimous?

3231
02:36:07,460 --> 02:36:08,420
...this indecency.

3232
02:36:08,420 --> 02:36:08,960
What does that mean?

3233
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:12,520
...but the day you hold another cigarette will be your last.

3234
02:36:12,860 --> 02:36:13,300
Ooh.

3235
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:14,640
Thank you, sir.

3236
02:36:14,900 --> 02:36:16,200
Take a look at this floor.

3237
02:36:16,440 --> 02:36:19,080
It's littered of cigarette butts, you pigs.

3238
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:19,540
Nasty.

3239
02:36:19,700 --> 02:36:22,340
Have you been tossing these without putting them out?

3240
02:36:22,380 --> 02:36:22,740
Oh, generous.

3241
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:23,400
Magnanimous.

3242
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:24,020
You'll run the building down.

3243
02:36:24,420 --> 02:36:25,420
Just like me.

3244
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:25,760
Not to mess in the pollution.

3245
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:26,020
You'll run the building down.

3246
02:36:26,020 --> 02:36:26,700
I'm magnanimous.

3247
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:29,700
And what happens if a passing child gets burnt from these?

3248
02:36:30,100 --> 02:36:31,320
Fucking swine.

3249
02:36:31,580 --> 02:36:33,300
Lean down, little piggies.

3250
02:36:33,440 --> 02:36:37,080
And collect all these cigarette butts with your mouths.

3251
02:36:37,380 --> 02:36:37,880
Now.

3252
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:38,460
Yes, sir.

3253
02:36:38,460 --> 02:36:38,960
Ew.

3254
02:36:39,780 --> 02:36:40,600
Oh, my God.

3255
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:41,460
They actually did it.

3256
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:42,420
Yes, sir.

3257
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:47,500
Now.

3258
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:50,760
Get out of here and go back to your posts.

3259
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:51,600
Yes, sir.

3260
02:36:56,430 --> 02:36:56,930
Yay.

3261
02:36:57,210 --> 02:36:57,850
This is it.

3262
02:36:57,870 --> 02:36:58,790
I have a table at the Communication Tower.

3263
02:37:01,150 --> 02:37:02,490
That was so silly.

3264
02:37:03,450 --> 02:37:04,030
Wait.

3265
02:37:04,090 --> 02:37:05,390
There's no helicopter up here, though.

3266
02:37:07,410 --> 02:37:07,990
Unless...

3267
02:37:10,830 --> 02:37:11,410
Unless...

3268
02:37:14,200 --> 02:37:15,300
That was something.

3269
02:37:17,880 --> 02:37:19,760
I got some metal clamps.

3270
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:22,580
And more metal clamps.

3271
02:37:22,760 --> 02:37:23,680
Metal clamps.

3272
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:28,780
This is crazy.

3273
02:37:28,940 --> 02:37:29,780
Fox is a legend.

3274
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,080
That guy goes hard.

3275
02:37:35,500 --> 02:37:36,920
Ah, the wires!

3276
02:37:37,060 --> 02:37:38,280
I was just going to blow it up.

3277
02:37:38,300 --> 02:37:41,380
I was just going to blow it up.

3278
02:37:47,880 --> 02:37:48,400
Ah!

3279
02:37:48,400 --> 02:37:49,320
That's crazy!

3280
02:37:50,260 --> 02:37:54,160
Guys, I have to also potty, so...

3281
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:57,820
I have to also potty.

3282
02:38:01,160 --> 02:38:02,180
...the bomb solved the enigma.

3283
02:38:02,380 --> 02:38:10,020
It read, Communication Antenna Sparky SGL-65B Anti-Vandalism System.

3284
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:15,300
Anti-personnel bomb explode if person attempt cut antenna signal.

3285
02:38:16,070 --> 02:38:23,840
Explosion will not affect structure, but shrapnel eject outside literally destroy any person nearby.

3286
02:38:24,700 --> 02:38:24,940
Hmm.

3287
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:26,000
Interesting.

3288
02:38:26,340 --> 02:38:29,040
Sergeant, do we have anything similar on base?

3289
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:30,080
No, Lieutenant.

3290
02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:31,460
But we can request for one.

3291
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:33,060
So it just explodes shrapnel.

3292
02:38:33,060 --> 02:38:34,400
Well, continue with your farce, Mr. Fox.

3293
02:38:35,620 --> 02:38:36,580
My farce?

3294
02:38:36,780 --> 02:38:39,820
For emergency purpose, disconnect antenna.

3295
02:38:40,820 --> 02:38:46,360
Prevent explosion by follow KGS-185-U protocol.

3296
02:38:47,220 --> 02:38:48,680
And what the hell is that protocol?

3297
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:52,260
The KGS-185-U protocol.

3298
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:57,580
I didn't figure it out at first, but it turns out that I had read that name before.

3299
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:58,380
We got the map!

3300
02:38:58,540 --> 02:38:59,020
We got it!

3301
02:38:59,020 --> 02:38:59,340
We got it!

3302
02:38:59,420 --> 02:38:59,440
Oh!

3303
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:24,520
Um...

3304
02:39:27,420 --> 02:39:29,400
What does the left side mean?

3305
02:39:44,180 --> 02:39:47,180
So first we do the red to the gray.

3306
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:51,000
Red to the gray.

3307
02:39:52,780 --> 02:39:54,000
But what do we do here?

3308
02:39:54,340 --> 02:39:55,240
I don't even have...

3309
02:39:55,240 --> 02:39:56,520
Oh wait, do I still have the bolt colors?

3310
02:39:56,740 --> 02:39:57,340
Oh I do.

3311
02:39:58,160 --> 02:40:00,800
Does the metal clamps have anything to do with it?

3312
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:01,260
Hold on.

3313
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:09,760
Am I like... Oh, maybe I do a metal clamp from those two and then I cut...

3314
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:10,280
Okay, hold on.

3315
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:11,860
So, metal clamp... Oh, sorry.

3316
02:40:11,960 --> 02:40:12,140
My bad.

3317
02:40:13,420 --> 02:40:14,140
Metal clamp...

3318
02:40:17,240 --> 02:40:17,600
Maybe?

3319
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:26,990
It won't let me do it, though.

3320
02:40:29,290 --> 02:40:31,450
Like, I can only look at it, but I can't do anything.

3321
02:40:33,070 --> 02:40:33,630
Punch it?

3322
02:40:35,050 --> 02:40:35,650
Huh?

3323
02:40:38,970 --> 02:40:40,190
Am I missing something?

3324
02:40:40,710 --> 02:40:43,430
Let's go explore down below and see if there's anything.

3325
02:40:43,590 --> 02:40:44,490
Maybe that will show up.

3326
02:40:49,730 --> 02:40:51,690
Are you sure this won't break?

3327
02:40:58,130 --> 02:41:00,170
This area seems empty.

3328
02:41:00,790 --> 02:41:01,890
Too empty.

3329
02:41:02,270 --> 02:41:03,110
I'm scared.

3330
02:41:03,650 --> 02:41:04,850
I'm scared right now.

3331
02:41:06,590 --> 02:41:07,190
Wait.

3332
02:41:07,190 --> 02:41:08,150
What's back here?

3333
02:41:12,130 --> 02:41:12,770
Nothing?

3334
02:41:12,770 --> 02:41:13,410
Really?

3335
02:41:13,950 --> 02:41:14,590
Okay.

3336
02:41:17,190 --> 02:41:17,830
Oh!

3337
02:41:18,150 --> 02:41:18,770
The helicopter.

3338
02:41:19,010 --> 02:41:19,470
The helipad.

3339
02:41:20,630 --> 02:41:21,330
The helicopter!

3340
02:41:29,510 --> 02:41:30,150
Okay.

3341
02:41:31,670 --> 02:41:32,310
Okay.

3342
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:39,160
Definitely not a Hindie.

3343
02:41:39,380 --> 02:41:40,020
No.

3344
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:41,160
Why would it be that?

3345
02:41:43,460 --> 02:41:44,420
There it was.

3346
02:41:44,760 --> 02:41:47,260
The helicopter I eventually escaped in.

3347
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,660
No, that's the Harrier.

3348
02:41:48,660 --> 02:41:49,940
You inevitably shoot it down.

3349
02:41:51,020 --> 02:41:51,900
But, fuck.

3350
02:41:52,220 --> 02:41:56,000
If I flew away, the surface-to-air defenses would shoot me down.

3351
02:41:56,280 --> 02:41:56,720
Yeah.

3352
02:41:56,800 --> 02:42:01,240
I had to disable that communication antenna so they wouldn't receive the command to fire.

3353
02:42:01,360 --> 02:42:01,880
A Harrier-D.

3354
02:42:02,060 --> 02:42:03,320
This would, instead...

3355
02:42:03,320 --> 02:42:04,180
I don't like that sound.

3356
02:42:04,180 --> 02:42:05,220
Provide you the pleasure to take me down yourselves.

3357
02:42:05,220 --> 02:42:06,300
I don't like saying that, actually.

3358
02:42:06,780 --> 02:42:07,540
You bastards.

3359
02:42:09,380 --> 02:42:11,040
Actually, I don't want to say that ever again.

3360
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:17,440
Um...

3361
02:42:18,760 --> 02:42:20,560
Oh, I need a keycard here.

3362
02:42:24,760 --> 02:42:25,960
So, then...

3363
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:27,580
What is the plan?

3364
02:42:31,340 --> 02:42:32,480
What is the plan?

3365
02:42:33,220 --> 02:42:35,460
With the cuts... with the wires...

3366
02:42:35,460 --> 02:42:38,820
I feel like I have everything I need, but...

3367
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:42,380
No one responds.

3368
02:42:43,180 --> 02:42:43,560
Robert, still there?

3369
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:45,460
Oh, okay.

3370
02:42:46,360 --> 02:42:47,420
Punch the helipad.

3371
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:47,680
It's a helipad.

3372
02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:50,120
Yeah.

3373
02:42:55,300 --> 02:42:56,300
Do I...

3374
02:42:56,300 --> 02:42:56,940
But the...

3375
02:42:56,940 --> 02:43:00,760
From the sequence of events, it looks like we do not cut first, right?

3376
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:04,520
It looks like we must...

3377
02:43:04,520 --> 02:43:06,300
We must cut...

3378
02:43:06,300 --> 02:43:07,980
Do the wire stuff first.

3379
02:43:08,240 --> 02:43:09,500
Or the clamps first.

3380
02:43:12,060 --> 02:43:13,980
You need wires, probably?

3381
02:43:15,540 --> 02:43:18,660
We have wires right in front of us.

3382
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,260
Why can't I do the clips then?

3383
02:43:22,860 --> 02:43:25,400
Do I combine them with something?

3384
02:43:30,460 --> 02:43:32,480
Combine them with the instructions!

3385
02:43:32,820 --> 02:43:38,100
I thought I was really cooking there.

3386
02:43:48,580 --> 02:43:51,680
If I select this and if I start blasting...

3387
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:53,800
I use the bolt cutter to cut the...

3388
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:58,800
The bolt cutters cut the red wire...

3389
02:44:05,660 --> 02:44:11,360
What do I combine though?

3390
02:44:16,260 --> 02:44:17,160
Maybe this!

3391
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:24,360
Why do we still have the rusty wire if we don't even need it?

3392
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:29,360
Uhhh...

3393
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:33,100
If only there was a diagram that showed us which wires were okay to cut.

3394
02:44:33,360 --> 02:44:36,120
If only there was a person in chat with a brain!

3395
02:44:38,060 --> 02:44:39,820
Who knew that I was just kidding around!

3396
02:44:54,400 --> 02:44:55,800
Is there anymore...

3397
02:44:55,800 --> 02:44:57,200
I need more up.

3398
02:44:57,440 --> 02:44:57,920
Let's see.

3399
02:45:04,280 --> 02:45:04,720
Umm...

3400
02:45:06,980 --> 02:45:08,500
Mike was...

3401
02:45:09,360 --> 02:45:10,120
Past...

3402
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:13,040
These guys...

3403
02:45:13,800 --> 02:45:15,440
Down here...

3404
02:45:15,440 --> 02:45:17,880
Then we go past the boss room...

3405
02:45:17,880 --> 02:45:19,540
Maybe he knows of some wires.

3406
02:45:30,630 --> 02:45:31,770
Maybe he knows.

3407
02:45:32,790 --> 02:45:34,870
I'm making this guy sweat.

3408
02:45:35,250 --> 02:45:37,270
Because I'm destroying all the...

3409
02:45:37,870 --> 02:45:38,690
Air conditioning.

3410
02:45:39,910 --> 02:45:40,670
Hey!

3411
02:45:41,750 --> 02:45:42,130
Seriously!

3412
02:45:42,650 --> 02:45:43,350
Don't know anything!

3413
02:45:45,230 --> 02:45:45,930
Hmm...

3414
02:45:47,950 --> 02:45:48,650
Hmm...

3415
02:45:51,150 --> 02:45:52,250
Let's see...

3416
02:45:52,740 --> 02:45:53,090
Okay...

3417
02:45:54,010 --> 02:45:55,810
Maybe there's something...

3418
02:45:57,170 --> 02:45:57,870
Upstairs...

3419
02:45:57,870 --> 02:45:58,910
Or rather...

3420
02:45:58,910 --> 02:46:02,130
I ran all the way back here for nothing.

3421
02:46:02,670 --> 02:46:05,490
Is there anything else maybe we can destroy?

3422
02:46:06,290 --> 02:46:08,170
Perhaps combine wire and clamps.

3423
02:46:09,270 --> 02:46:11,250
Drawing has a line between the clamps.

3424
02:46:11,470 --> 02:46:12,070
Like this?

3425
02:46:12,330 --> 02:46:12,650
I...

3426
02:46:12,650 --> 02:46:13,270
Wait...

3427
02:46:13,270 --> 02:46:13,450
No...

3428
02:46:13,450 --> 02:46:13,950
I tried that.

3429
02:46:16,150 --> 02:46:16,590
I...

3430
02:46:16,590 --> 02:46:17,190
I tried that.

3431
02:46:24,860 --> 02:46:26,600
Is the condenser near the antenna?

3432
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:27,500
Oh, okay.

3433
02:46:32,060 --> 02:46:32,800
Let's see...

3434
02:46:32,800 --> 02:46:33,560
Open up.

3435
02:46:34,280 --> 02:46:35,160
Open sesame.

3436
02:46:37,380 --> 02:46:38,640
Break the machines on the roof.

3437
02:46:38,780 --> 02:46:38,900
Oh!

3438
02:46:39,080 --> 02:46:40,380
I was doing that though!

3439
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:42,000
You mean I actually have to do that?

3440
02:46:42,880 --> 02:46:43,540
Like these?

3441
02:46:48,430 --> 02:46:48,870
Ah!

3442
02:46:48,910 --> 02:46:49,350
Ah!

3443
02:46:50,010 --> 02:46:50,450
Ah!

3444
02:46:50,450 --> 02:46:51,130
I see.

3445
02:46:51,330 --> 02:46:51,950
I see.

3446
02:46:52,010 --> 02:46:52,550
I see.

3447
02:46:52,590 --> 02:46:53,190
I see.

3448
02:46:53,370 --> 02:46:54,030
I see.

3449
02:46:54,070 --> 02:46:54,390
Okay.

3450
02:46:54,530 --> 02:46:54,810
Okay.

3451
02:46:54,870 --> 02:46:55,130
Okay.

3452
02:46:55,510 --> 02:46:59,530
So I was actually doing the appropriate thing by being an asshole.

3453
02:47:01,250 --> 02:47:03,470
This is why you break everything you guys!

3454
02:47:04,690 --> 02:47:05,330
Truth!

3455
02:47:13,770 --> 02:47:16,310
I got a grenade slot.

3456
02:47:17,070 --> 02:47:18,110
Hey Mike!

3457
02:47:19,070 --> 02:47:20,850
And a shortcut.

3458
02:47:23,230 --> 02:47:24,170
Let's go!

3459
02:47:24,170 --> 02:47:24,490
I'm going to the next room.

3460
02:47:41,740 --> 02:47:42,260
Where?

3461
02:47:44,300 --> 02:47:44,820
Else?

3462
02:47:45,160 --> 02:47:51,420
Well, I know I can combine with you wires with clamps.

3463
02:47:52,220 --> 02:47:55,100
But we need three more.

3464
02:47:55,900 --> 02:47:57,000
Or two more, rather.

3465
02:47:57,060 --> 02:47:58,100
We need three in total.

3466
02:47:59,820 --> 02:48:01,480
That air duct looks punchable.

3467
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:03,720
This one?

3468
02:48:09,160 --> 02:48:09,680
Ah!

3469
02:48:09,700 --> 02:48:10,220
Ah!

3470
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:10,480
Ah!

3471
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:17,340
Yes!

3472
02:48:19,200 --> 02:48:20,180
Not that one.

3473
02:48:20,240 --> 02:48:20,600
This one.

3474
02:48:21,180 --> 02:48:22,060
Not that one.

3475
02:48:22,320 --> 02:48:23,220
Not that one.

3476
02:48:23,680 --> 02:48:24,320
This one.

3477
02:48:26,900 --> 02:48:27,340
No.

3478
02:48:28,040 --> 02:48:28,640
This one.

3479
02:48:29,080 --> 02:48:29,520
Yes!

3480
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:29,860
Yes!

3481
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:30,080
Yes!

3482
02:48:31,340 --> 02:48:31,780
Um...

3483
02:48:32,560 --> 02:48:33,340
This one too?

3484
02:48:33,460 --> 02:48:33,680
Wait.

3485
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:35,460
Is that all we need?

3486
02:48:36,780 --> 02:48:37,220
Combine?

3487
02:48:38,600 --> 02:48:39,040
Yeah!

3488
02:48:39,180 --> 02:48:40,100
We got three of them!

3489
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:40,460
Okay.

3490
02:48:40,560 --> 02:48:41,180
We're good!

3491
02:48:41,620 --> 02:48:43,300
I still want to know how to get in here though.

3492
02:48:43,900 --> 02:48:44,340
Oh!

3493
02:48:44,360 --> 02:48:44,780
Oh no!

3494
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:45,200
There's more.

3495
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:45,320
I'm just kidding.

3496
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:46,180
I know how to get in here.

3497
02:48:46,280 --> 02:48:46,780
I forgot.

3498
02:48:46,900 --> 02:48:47,560
There was a door.

3499
02:48:47,740 --> 02:48:48,980
And I don't have the thing.

3500
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:50,920
Okey-dokey!

3501
02:48:51,080 --> 02:48:54,600
Let's head back and destroy a thing!

3502
02:48:55,520 --> 02:48:56,520
Let's do it!

3503
02:48:57,040 --> 02:48:58,120
Let's do it!

3504
02:49:00,780 --> 02:49:01,300
So...

3505
02:49:01,300 --> 02:49:01,940
Yeah.

3506
02:49:03,800 --> 02:49:04,320
Okay.

3507
02:49:05,700 --> 02:49:07,140
We have the protocol.

3508
02:49:07,780 --> 02:49:12,340
We need to combine the red and the gray.

3509
02:49:14,080 --> 02:49:14,600
Oh.

3510
02:49:14,620 --> 02:49:15,180
I keep pressing the button.

3511
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:16,080
I'm pressing escape for some reason.

3512
02:49:16,220 --> 02:49:16,340
Okay.

3513
02:49:19,780 --> 02:49:22,740
I use the wire with clamps to connect the...

3514
02:49:22,740 --> 02:49:25,420
Connect the red wire...

3515
02:49:26,200 --> 02:49:26,960
With the...

3516
02:49:28,760 --> 02:49:29,960
White wire...

3517
02:49:32,980 --> 02:49:33,280
Okay.

3518
02:49:34,700 --> 02:49:35,300
Next...

3519
02:49:38,740 --> 02:49:39,340
Is...

3520
02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:44,680
The black wire with the green wire!

3521
02:49:44,900 --> 02:49:45,180
Okay.

3522
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:46,500
Oh my gosh.

3523
02:49:46,540 --> 02:49:47,820
I keep doing this every time.

3524
02:49:47,860 --> 02:49:48,520
What's wrong with me?

3525
02:49:51,620 --> 02:49:54,720
I use the wire with clamps to connect the...

3526
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:57,580
Black wire...

3527
02:49:57,580 --> 02:49:58,400
With the...

3528
02:49:58,400 --> 02:50:00,800
Green wire...

3529
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:02,480
Yes.

3530
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:04,560
Yes.

3531
02:50:05,680 --> 02:50:07,980
And then it's yellow and blue.

3532
02:50:08,700 --> 02:50:09,340
Ah!

3533
02:50:09,480 --> 02:50:09,940
Okay.

3534
02:50:10,420 --> 02:50:10,980
Okay.

3535
02:50:11,620 --> 02:50:11,840
Okay.

3536
02:50:12,500 --> 02:50:13,140
Okay.

3537
02:50:13,740 --> 02:50:14,380
Okay.

3538
02:50:14,380 --> 02:50:14,680
Okay.

3539
02:50:14,720 --> 02:50:17,580
I use the wire with clamps to connect the...

3540
02:50:17,580 --> 02:50:20,060
Yellow wire...

3541
02:50:20,060 --> 02:50:21,040
With the...

3542
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:21,820
Blue...

3543
02:50:21,820 --> 02:50:23,600
I feel like I'm on Dora the Explorer.

3544
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:26,980
Do you know which wires to clamp?

3545
02:50:28,900 --> 02:50:30,260
Very good!

3546
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:32,660
Blue wire!

3547
02:50:34,500 --> 02:50:36,820
Now we cut...

3548
02:50:37,720 --> 02:50:39,080
We cut...

3549
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:41,620
The blue wire.

3550
02:50:42,780 --> 02:50:44,040
We cut the blue wire.

3551
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:46,120
We cut the blue wire.

3552
02:50:47,720 --> 02:50:48,120
We cut the blue wire.

3553
02:50:48,240 --> 02:50:49,540
We cut the blue wire.

3554
02:50:50,740 --> 02:50:53,720
I use the bolt cutter to cut the...

3555
02:51:02,100 --> 02:51:03,340
I have to check every time.

3556
02:51:03,780 --> 02:51:04,180
Oop!

3557
02:51:04,780 --> 02:51:05,880
I have to check every time.

3558
02:51:06,780 --> 02:51:07,180
Blue...

3559
02:51:07,180 --> 02:51:07,360
Okay.

3560
02:51:07,440 --> 02:51:08,280
Now red...

3561
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:09,820
Red and then black.

3562
02:51:10,120 --> 02:51:10,800
Red, black.

3563
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:11,480
Red, black.

3564
02:51:11,500 --> 02:51:12,000
Red, black.

3565
02:51:12,040 --> 02:51:12,500
Red, black.

3566
02:51:12,540 --> 02:51:12,940
Red, black.

3567
02:51:12,980 --> 02:51:13,400
Red, black.

3568
02:51:13,860 --> 02:51:14,500
Red, black.

3569
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:15,760
Red, black.

3570
02:51:15,800 --> 02:51:16,300
Red, black.

3571
02:51:16,360 --> 02:51:16,680
Red, black.

3572
02:51:16,680 --> 02:51:17,000
Red, black.

3573
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:17,600
Red, black.

3574
02:51:17,640 --> 02:51:18,160
Red, black.

3575
02:51:18,880 --> 02:51:19,500
Red, black.

3576
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:20,180
Black, red, black.

3577
02:51:23,980 --> 02:51:28,480
Red, white, red, black.

3578
02:51:33,730 --> 02:51:36,050
Black wire!

3579
02:51:38,170 --> 02:51:38,750
Whee!

3580
02:51:41,880 --> 02:51:43,040
Yes.

3581
02:51:47,260 --> 02:51:47,840
Yes.

3582
02:51:52,520 --> 02:51:53,180
And escape!

3583
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:56,240
All good.

3584
02:51:56,440 --> 02:51:58,220
Reach the heliport at the rooftop.

3585
02:51:58,900 --> 02:52:00,180
Why is that the mission?

3586
02:52:00,560 --> 02:52:01,740
What's gonna go wrong?

3587
02:52:02,080 --> 02:52:03,200
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

3588
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:04,980
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

3589
02:52:06,280 --> 02:52:07,240
Everything's fine.

3590
02:52:08,700 --> 02:52:09,620
Everything's fine.

3591
02:52:11,420 --> 02:52:12,020
Helicopter.

3592
02:52:14,320 --> 02:52:15,420
Here I come.

3593
02:52:17,770 --> 02:52:19,190
What about the metal though?

3594
02:52:23,890 --> 02:52:25,090
You inevitably shoot it down.

3595
02:52:25,330 --> 02:52:25,510
What?

3596
02:52:25,990 --> 02:52:26,770
But fuck.

3597
02:52:27,030 --> 02:52:27,290
Wait, what?

3598
02:52:27,290 --> 02:52:28,150
I didn't have the damn key.

3599
02:52:28,390 --> 02:52:29,930
I needed it to get the door open.

3600
02:52:29,950 --> 02:52:30,690
No, I have a key!

3601
02:52:32,330 --> 02:52:33,610
Obtain the helicopter's key.

3602
02:52:33,730 --> 02:52:34,170
I have key.

3603
02:52:34,970 --> 02:52:35,870
This is probably it.

3604
02:52:41,310 --> 02:52:42,110
No key.

3605
02:52:53,940 --> 02:52:55,020
What if I...

3606
02:52:55,020 --> 02:52:56,960
If I stand on this, do I get smushed?

3607
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:10,320
I feel like I've exhausted everything.

3608
02:53:10,900 --> 02:53:14,100
I will try to talk to Mike again.

3609
02:53:14,200 --> 02:53:18,160
See if what he thinks could be the case.

3610
02:53:18,560 --> 02:53:18,640
Oh!

3611
02:53:19,240 --> 02:53:20,820
Hey Fox, are you there?

3612
02:53:21,020 --> 02:53:21,380
Yeah.

3613
02:53:21,440 --> 02:53:22,340
Here I am, Robert.

3614
02:53:22,340 --> 02:53:22,940
I'm here, Robert.

3615
02:53:23,200 --> 02:53:24,480
You find a chopper yet?

3616
02:53:24,680 --> 02:53:25,000
Yeah.

3617
02:53:25,060 --> 02:53:27,500
Found a helicopter, but I don't have the key.

3618
02:53:28,060 --> 02:53:29,400
Can't you hotwire it?

3619
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:31,540
I can't even open the outer door.

3620
02:53:31,860 --> 02:53:34,020
How smart do you think I am, Robert?

3621
02:53:34,260 --> 02:53:35,940
What is Jesse Fox?

3622
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:37,220
No problem.

3623
02:53:37,220 --> 02:53:40,840
Let's see if a guard can be tricked into telling where a spare key is.

3624
02:53:41,060 --> 02:53:41,900
Thanks, friend.

3625
02:53:44,040 --> 02:53:45,440
I can't trick Mike.

3626
02:53:45,580 --> 02:53:46,300
He's my friend.

3627
02:53:50,380 --> 02:53:52,740
Hey Mike, how did they bring you here?

3628
02:53:53,060 --> 02:53:55,480
In a helicopter, like everyone else.

3629
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:56,960
Everyone but me.

3630
02:53:57,380 --> 02:53:59,280
Mike, I'm looking for the key to that helicopter.

3631
02:53:59,880 --> 02:54:00,140
Yeah.

3632
02:54:01,040 --> 02:54:02,880
General X probably has it in his office.

3633
02:54:02,880 --> 02:54:03,740
General X.

3634
02:54:03,920 --> 02:54:04,000
Is it far?

3635
02:54:04,460 --> 02:54:05,720
You're right in front of it.

3636
02:54:05,860 --> 02:54:06,240
Oh.

3637
02:54:06,360 --> 02:54:06,940
That door?

3638
02:54:07,500 --> 02:54:07,980
Yes.

3639
02:54:09,020 --> 02:54:10,100
Finally some luck.

3640
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:11,240
But...

3641
02:54:11,240 --> 02:54:11,660
But?

3642
02:54:12,320 --> 02:54:12,760
What?

3643
02:54:12,940 --> 02:54:13,560
It needs a key.

3644
02:54:13,800 --> 02:54:15,360
Only General X can open it.

3645
02:54:15,400 --> 02:54:15,600
Oh.

3646
02:54:15,800 --> 02:54:16,120
Shit.

3647
02:54:16,920 --> 02:54:18,580
Can't you use your magic?

3648
02:54:18,820 --> 02:54:19,720
Come on, Mike.

3649
02:54:19,880 --> 02:54:20,320
Nope.

3650
02:54:20,320 --> 02:54:21,260
There has to be a way to get in there.

3651
02:54:21,260 --> 02:54:21,900
Come on, Mike.

3652
02:54:21,920 --> 02:54:23,100
What if General X like...

3653
02:54:23,100 --> 02:54:23,660
A door or something.

3654
02:54:23,980 --> 02:54:25,180
What if he dies in there?

3655
02:54:25,280 --> 02:54:26,400
Nobody can open it?

3656
02:54:26,900 --> 02:54:27,340
Wait.

3657
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:29,560
His office might have another entrance.

3658
02:54:29,960 --> 02:54:32,900
A while ago, I was studying the map of this building.

3659
02:54:33,020 --> 02:54:33,280
Yes.

3660
02:54:33,440 --> 02:54:34,720
And I saw something weird.

3661
02:54:35,060 --> 02:54:35,500
Weird.

3662
02:54:35,620 --> 02:54:35,920
Weird.

3663
02:54:36,320 --> 02:54:37,040
What was weird?

3664
02:54:37,040 --> 02:54:37,820
What was weird?

3665
02:54:38,040 --> 02:54:38,760
The office might have another entrance.

3666
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:39,540
It's a private elevator.

3667
02:54:39,580 --> 02:54:40,800
It leads to the basement.

3668
02:54:40,860 --> 02:54:41,360
To the basement?

3669
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:44,260
Always wondered why he wanted an unlocked private elevator.

3670
02:54:44,520 --> 02:54:44,820
Okay.

3671
02:54:44,900 --> 02:54:46,160
So you could take the main elevator to the basement.

3672
02:54:46,160 --> 02:54:46,580
No.

3673
02:54:46,660 --> 02:54:47,940
The labyrinth.

3674
02:54:48,360 --> 02:54:49,760
Oh, gosh.

3675
02:54:50,640 --> 02:54:51,520
The labyrinth.

3676
02:54:51,820 --> 02:54:52,580
Thanks, Mike.

3677
02:54:52,880 --> 02:54:54,180
I'm going to the basement.

3678
02:54:54,880 --> 02:54:55,320
Mike.

3679
02:54:55,580 --> 02:54:56,020
Wait.

3680
02:54:56,140 --> 02:54:56,480
What?

3681
02:54:56,740 --> 02:54:58,540
The basement has a fucking maze.

3682
02:54:58,740 --> 02:54:59,020
Yeah.

3683
02:54:59,100 --> 02:54:59,340
I know.

3684
02:54:59,460 --> 02:55:00,320
Take this map with you.

3685
02:55:00,340 --> 02:55:01,920
You'll need it to get through safely.

3686
02:55:02,140 --> 02:55:02,280
Oh.

3687
02:55:02,900 --> 02:55:03,800
Thanks, Mike.

3688
02:55:05,560 --> 02:55:06,000
Thanks.

3689
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:06,380
Bye.

3690
02:55:06,380 --> 02:55:06,680
Bye.

3691
02:55:07,240 --> 02:55:07,680
Bye.

3692
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:16,740
What does it mean?

3693
02:55:18,620 --> 02:55:21,530
Hey, Fox.

3694
02:55:21,870 --> 02:55:23,870
Weren't you searching for a helicopter key?

3695
02:55:24,130 --> 02:55:24,870
Not yet.

3696
02:55:25,710 --> 02:55:26,150
No.

3697
02:55:27,210 --> 02:55:27,550
Not yet.

3698
02:55:27,710 --> 02:55:28,570
But I believe...

3699
02:55:28,570 --> 02:55:30,250
You called me like two seconds ago.

3700
02:55:30,350 --> 02:55:31,010
How would I get it?

3701
02:55:31,110 --> 02:55:31,130
Why?

3702
02:55:31,290 --> 02:55:33,210
Because I heard some talk on the radio.

3703
02:55:33,750 --> 02:55:36,350
They're keeping a copy of that key in a special room.

3704
02:55:42,950 --> 02:55:45,490
With an X!

3705
02:55:47,690 --> 02:55:48,050
Okay.

3706
02:55:49,670 --> 02:55:50,630
Okay, we got this.

3707
02:55:56,330 --> 02:55:57,690
Is it the one on the rooftop?

3708
02:55:58,050 --> 02:55:58,970
I actually didn't check.

3709
02:56:03,130 --> 02:56:06,490
I don't know if it's easier to go this way, or to go out.

3710
02:56:07,250 --> 02:56:08,950
But here we can save, so...

3711
02:56:09,670 --> 02:56:11,430
I was gonna say, like, through the rooftop.

3712
02:56:11,510 --> 02:56:12,490
But, you know, whatever.

3713
02:56:15,150 --> 02:56:17,470
Marked with an X marks the spot!

3714
02:56:18,030 --> 02:56:19,670
It has to be where it is.

3715
02:56:22,930 --> 02:56:28,190
Look at these guys, just lazy, lazy, lazy to sleep on the job.

3716
02:56:28,570 --> 02:56:30,310
Where'd those guys go that were smoking?

3717
02:56:32,010 --> 02:56:34,090
Okay, to the basement!

3718
02:56:35,410 --> 02:56:36,290
To the basement!

3719
02:56:36,590 --> 02:56:37,170
To the basement!

3720
02:56:37,310 --> 02:56:40,410
To the b-b-b-b-b-basement!

3721
02:56:40,810 --> 02:56:42,550
To the b-b-b-b-b-basement!

3722
02:56:42,550 --> 02:56:43,530
To the b-b-b-b-b-basement!

3723
02:56:43,890 --> 02:56:44,730
To the basement!

3724
02:56:47,170 --> 02:56:47,690
Oh!

3725
02:56:48,810 --> 02:56:50,090
To the basement!

3726
02:56:50,390 --> 02:56:52,230
To the b-b-b-b-basement!

3727
02:56:55,630 --> 02:56:57,470
I wish to enter the labyrinth.

3728
02:56:57,970 --> 02:57:01,950
Then say friend in Elvish, and the door will open.

3729
02:57:02,690 --> 02:57:04,550
Friend in Elvish?

3730
02:57:05,410 --> 02:57:05,890
Shit.

3731
02:57:06,130 --> 02:57:09,230
Turns out the mental patient was a fucking Lord of the Rings geek.

3732
02:57:09,470 --> 02:57:09,950
Friend?

3733
02:57:10,010 --> 02:57:13,470
What person in their right mind knows how to say friend in Elvish?

3734
02:57:13,850 --> 02:57:15,930
Well, I don't know the word.

3735
02:57:15,950 --> 02:57:16,790
I'm not looking at chat.

3736
02:57:17,170 --> 02:57:17,570
Give me a hint.

3737
02:57:17,850 --> 02:57:22,470
I'm afraid I can't grant any assistance to this enigma.

3738
02:57:22,930 --> 02:57:27,570
What if I grant you a punch in the face of fruit?

3739
02:57:27,770 --> 02:57:28,770
Big fruit?

3740
02:57:29,010 --> 02:57:29,490
Fruit?

3741
02:57:29,650 --> 02:57:29,650
Fruit?

3742
02:57:29,830 --> 02:57:30,650
Do you eat it in the summer?

3743
02:57:31,230 --> 02:57:31,710
Watermelon?

3744
02:57:31,890 --> 02:57:33,030
It lacks water.

3745
02:57:33,850 --> 02:57:34,330
Melon?

3746
02:57:35,550 --> 02:57:36,030
Melon!

3747
02:57:37,790 --> 02:57:39,530
That's how you say friend in Elvish?

3748
02:57:39,590 --> 02:57:39,910
For real?

3749
02:57:40,730 --> 02:57:42,070
I couldn't see shit.

3750
02:57:42,310 --> 02:57:46,710
If that labyrinth was full of traps, I was going to need something to see in there.

3751
02:57:46,850 --> 02:57:47,050
Oh no.

3752
02:57:48,350 --> 02:57:48,830
Wait!

3753
02:57:51,170 --> 02:57:52,690
So now I have to find a flashlight.

3754
02:57:55,150 --> 02:57:56,070
My sunglasses.

3755
02:57:58,250 --> 02:57:58,870
What the?

3756
02:58:05,030 --> 02:58:05,510
Fine.

3757
02:58:05,510 --> 02:58:05,750
Fine.

3758
02:58:11,210 --> 02:58:12,330
Bully him again?

3759
02:58:13,150 --> 02:58:13,530
Okay.

3760
02:58:13,670 --> 02:58:16,650
I'll bully him this time with with cutters.

3761
02:58:17,270 --> 02:58:18,050
Hey buddy.

3762
02:58:22,390 --> 02:58:23,150
Pineapple!

3763
02:58:24,030 --> 02:58:24,790
Cherries!

3764
02:58:25,410 --> 02:58:26,170
Orange!

3765
02:58:27,610 --> 02:58:28,370
Melon!

3766
02:58:28,370 --> 02:58:28,410
Melon!

3767
02:58:32,410 --> 02:58:33,790
I couldn't see shit.

3768
02:58:33,930 --> 02:58:34,190
Oh okay.

3769
02:58:35,430 --> 02:58:35,950
Dang.

3770
02:58:38,830 --> 02:58:39,350
Pineapple!

3771
02:58:43,390 --> 02:58:43,910
Yeah...

3772
02:58:45,590 --> 02:58:46,110
Um...

3773
02:58:46,890 --> 02:58:56,530
Is there anything that we haven't been able to get because we didn't have like the keycard for it or something.

3774
02:58:56,750 --> 02:58:57,470
I'm trying to think.

3775
02:58:59,250 --> 02:58:59,690
Melon!

3776
02:59:04,960 --> 02:59:05,400
Um...

3777
02:59:06,960 --> 02:59:08,980
I'm just going to start exploring.

3778
02:59:09,240 --> 02:59:09,280
Oh!

3779
02:59:09,420 --> 02:59:09,960
We hit this one!

3780
02:59:15,010 --> 02:59:16,670
I was like there's gotta be...

3781
02:59:16,670 --> 02:59:17,390
Ah!

3782
02:59:18,190 --> 02:59:18,630
No.

3783
02:59:21,450 --> 02:59:21,890
No.

3784
02:59:23,210 --> 02:59:23,650
Okay.

3785
02:59:23,710 --> 02:59:24,990
We got night vision goggles everybody.

3786
02:59:25,350 --> 02:59:28,210
I was like there was some door I thought that we couldn't go.

3787
02:59:28,270 --> 02:59:29,430
Was there any other doors though?

3788
02:59:30,090 --> 02:59:31,290
I'm racking my brain.

3789
02:59:31,390 --> 02:59:32,310
I'm racking my brain.

3790
02:59:33,650 --> 02:59:34,090
Um...

3791
02:59:38,300 --> 02:59:39,600
We could go in that one.

3792
02:59:41,220 --> 02:59:42,600
We could go in this one.

3793
02:59:49,440 --> 02:59:50,720
That room looks suspicious.

3794
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:53,440
Melon?

3795
02:59:53,460 --> 02:59:55,240
I'm sorry but you have to leave.

3796
03:00:01,620 --> 03:00:02,060
Melons!

3797
03:00:06,740 --> 03:00:09,700
I don't think there was anything else that I um...

3798
03:00:09,700 --> 03:00:11,700
any other doors that I missed.

3799
03:00:12,560 --> 03:00:14,040
Well that was easy.

3800
03:00:14,460 --> 03:00:14,980
Um...

3801
03:00:19,280 --> 03:00:20,920
Any other... on the other floors though?

3802
03:00:21,620 --> 03:00:23,180
The other floor had the...

3803
03:00:23,180 --> 03:00:24,720
the um...

3804
03:00:27,320 --> 03:00:27,840
laboratory.

3805
03:00:27,840 --> 03:00:29,400
We went through everything in there.

3806
03:00:32,100 --> 03:00:33,240
I think we're good.

3807
03:00:33,640 --> 03:00:34,160
Okay.

3808
03:00:35,940 --> 03:00:36,460
Yippee!

3809
03:00:40,240 --> 03:00:40,760
Pineapple!

3810
03:00:40,920 --> 03:00:41,440
Pineapple!

3811
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:42,340
Cherries!

3812
03:00:44,240 --> 03:00:45,060
Keep going.

3813
03:00:45,240 --> 03:00:46,020
Keep going.

3814
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:47,160
Don't make me...

3815
03:00:47,160 --> 03:00:47,980
Don't let me stop you.

3816
03:00:48,180 --> 03:00:49,700
Wait, where's our night vision goggles?

3817
03:00:50,160 --> 03:00:50,540
Oh!

3818
03:00:50,540 --> 03:00:51,720
They're applied automatically.

3819
03:00:51,880 --> 03:00:52,160
Orange!

3820
03:00:52,660 --> 03:00:53,180
Orange!

3821
03:00:53,740 --> 03:00:54,260
Melon!

3822
03:00:57,820 --> 03:00:58,340
Oh!

3823
03:01:02,910 --> 03:01:04,490
Oh this is quite spooky.

3824
03:01:04,730 --> 03:01:05,010
Okay.

3825
03:01:05,730 --> 03:01:06,630
Let's get our map.

3826
03:01:07,810 --> 03:01:08,630
And a gun.

3827
03:01:11,490 --> 03:01:12,410
Okay.

3828
03:01:12,410 --> 03:01:13,990
And our map.

3829
03:01:14,650 --> 03:01:16,470
Which says...

3830
03:01:17,450 --> 03:01:18,370
East.

3831
03:01:18,670 --> 03:01:19,350
East.

3832
03:01:19,810 --> 03:01:20,610
Oop.

3833
03:01:20,690 --> 03:01:21,010
My bad.

3834
03:01:25,110 --> 03:01:26,030
Yeah.

3835
03:01:28,670 --> 03:01:30,830
Oh I can't even explore?

3836
03:01:32,250 --> 03:01:33,170
East!

3837
03:01:33,170 --> 03:01:35,950
The first letter was E.

3838
03:01:36,210 --> 03:01:38,190
So I took the path to the east.

3839
03:01:38,330 --> 03:01:38,610
East.

3840
03:01:39,110 --> 03:01:39,630
Yeah.

3841
03:01:40,930 --> 03:01:41,450
Oh.

3842
03:01:41,530 --> 03:01:41,870
Okay.

3843
03:01:41,930 --> 03:01:43,090
I can't even check the other ways?

3844
03:01:43,330 --> 03:01:44,450
This looks suspicious.

3845
03:01:49,470 --> 03:01:49,990
Okay.

3846
03:01:49,990 --> 03:01:52,010
Maybe it's just how it looks.

3847
03:01:52,110 --> 03:01:52,290
Oh.

3848
03:01:59,120 --> 03:01:59,640
No!

3849
03:02:00,360 --> 03:02:01,120
The metal!

3850
03:02:05,920 --> 03:02:07,780
Your east or my east?

3851
03:02:10,660 --> 03:02:11,220
Wait.

3852
03:02:11,840 --> 03:02:13,160
But the metal...

3853
03:02:14,840 --> 03:02:15,740
The metal!

3854
03:02:20,160 --> 03:02:22,340
The second letter was also an E.

3855
03:02:22,560 --> 03:02:24,040
So I took the east path.

3856
03:02:25,100 --> 03:02:29,380
I would make an effort to check the map at every intersection as I proceeded.

3857
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:30,020
Yes.

3858
03:02:30,300 --> 03:02:35,600
The map indicates the exits of each intersection, not the exits of each screen.

3859
03:02:37,320 --> 03:02:37,880
Okay.

3860
03:02:39,480 --> 03:02:40,040
Interesting.

3861
03:02:41,980 --> 03:02:42,940
Do not disturb.

3862
03:02:43,760 --> 03:02:44,740
Is it a mimic?

3863
03:02:52,690 --> 03:02:53,190
Okay.

3864
03:02:56,610 --> 03:02:57,110
East.

3865
03:03:00,850 --> 03:03:01,770
Where am I?

3866
03:03:03,990 --> 03:03:04,490
Oh.

3867
03:03:04,530 --> 03:03:05,150
I'm above.

3868
03:03:05,430 --> 03:03:05,850
I'm above.

3869
03:03:06,110 --> 03:03:06,850
There's a ghost!

3870
03:03:06,950 --> 03:03:07,410
There's a ghost!

3871
03:03:07,490 --> 03:03:07,950
There's a ghost!

3872
03:03:09,050 --> 03:03:10,570
You guys we have to go east!

3873
03:03:10,990 --> 03:03:12,230
We have to go towards the ghost!

3874
03:03:25,440 --> 03:03:25,940
Oh.

3875
03:03:29,640 --> 03:03:30,080
Um.

3876
03:03:30,640 --> 03:03:31,080
Um.

3877
03:03:32,660 --> 03:03:33,960
How do I get past this guy?

3878
03:03:39,160 --> 03:03:40,380
How do I get past him?

3879
03:03:40,740 --> 03:03:41,180
How do I get past him?

3880
03:03:41,180 --> 03:03:41,580
Can I shoot him?

3881
03:03:48,420 --> 03:03:50,540
Are you actually afraid of a ghost touching you?

3882
03:03:51,200 --> 03:03:51,640
Yeah!

3883
03:03:52,700 --> 03:03:53,500
Wouldn't you be?

3884
03:03:54,460 --> 03:03:56,440
I know what happens when a ghost touches me.

3885
03:03:57,580 --> 03:03:58,500
Or not me.

3886
03:03:58,640 --> 03:04:01,000
But when I touch someone, I know what happens.

3887
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:01,400
Okay?

3888
03:04:02,220 --> 03:04:02,700
Oh.

3889
03:04:02,840 --> 03:04:03,900
He's aggroed now.

3890
03:04:04,140 --> 03:04:04,480
Uh oh.

3891
03:04:04,520 --> 03:04:05,060
He's aggroed.

3892
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:09,980
We got him.

3893
03:04:11,220 --> 03:04:11,700
Oh.

3894
03:04:20,320 --> 03:04:21,520
I can go in here.

3895
03:04:22,600 --> 03:04:23,080
Interesting.

3896
03:04:23,200 --> 03:04:23,460
Okay.

3897
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:26,320
Okay.

3898
03:04:26,360 --> 03:04:27,580
So that one...

3899
03:04:27,580 --> 03:04:28,120
Okay.

3900
03:04:28,200 --> 03:04:30,140
Now this is our second intersection.

3901
03:04:30,300 --> 03:04:31,980
So we go west again.

3902
03:04:33,180 --> 03:04:33,660
Yeah.

3903
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:34,860
West again.

3904
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:35,420
Okay.

3905
03:04:35,420 --> 03:04:35,580
Okay.

3906
03:04:42,980 --> 03:04:43,380
Okay.

3907
03:04:43,420 --> 03:04:44,180
It's three hits guys.

3908
03:04:45,980 --> 03:04:46,680
Three hits.

3909
03:04:46,860 --> 03:04:47,020
Oh.

3910
03:04:47,120 --> 03:04:47,820
There's a second guy.

3911
03:04:51,340 --> 03:04:51,740
Reload.

3912
03:05:00,530 --> 03:05:01,750
Which way is this one?

3913
03:05:02,790 --> 03:05:03,190
North.

3914
03:05:07,340 --> 03:05:07,740
Oh!

3915
03:05:09,640 --> 03:05:10,040
Bullets!

3916
03:05:10,140 --> 03:05:10,500
Okay.

3917
03:05:10,620 --> 03:05:10,880
Cool.

3918
03:05:11,460 --> 03:05:11,860
Okay.

3919
03:05:11,980 --> 03:05:12,780
So sometimes...

3920
03:05:12,780 --> 03:05:13,180
Wait.

3921
03:05:13,240 --> 03:05:14,260
That could be a mimic though.

3922
03:05:14,300 --> 03:05:14,660
Couldn't it?

3923
03:05:20,980 --> 03:05:22,120
Couldn't it be a mimic sometimes?

3924
03:05:23,020 --> 03:05:23,420
Maybe?

3925
03:05:30,330 --> 03:05:31,010
More bullets.

3926
03:05:31,770 --> 03:05:32,850
We'll take what we can get.

3927
03:05:33,950 --> 03:05:34,350
Wait.

3928
03:05:34,410 --> 03:05:35,410
There's no intersection here.

3929
03:05:35,550 --> 03:05:36,670
So we just keep on going.

3930
03:05:40,530 --> 03:05:41,470
There's a ghost there.

3931
03:05:44,590 --> 03:05:45,390
Oh gosh!

3932
03:05:45,530 --> 03:05:46,210
They're so fast!

3933
03:05:47,930 --> 03:05:48,750
They're so fast!

3934
03:05:49,510 --> 03:05:49,910
Um.

3935
03:05:50,810 --> 03:05:51,650
Guys we do...

3936
03:05:51,650 --> 03:05:53,530
We're on the second north, right?

3937
03:05:54,570 --> 03:05:54,970
East?

3938
03:05:55,190 --> 03:05:56,530
I thought you said weast.

3939
03:05:56,710 --> 03:05:58,710
We're on the second north, right?

3940
03:05:59,850 --> 03:06:00,590
Second end?

3941
03:06:00,730 --> 03:06:00,910
Yeah.

3942
03:06:00,970 --> 03:06:01,150
Yeah.

3943
03:06:01,210 --> 03:06:01,450
Okay.

3944
03:06:01,550 --> 03:06:01,730
Okay.

3945
03:06:01,730 --> 03:06:02,210
That's what I thought.

3946
03:06:03,730 --> 03:06:05,090
I won't go that way.

3947
03:06:05,170 --> 03:06:05,930
Even though I want to.

3948
03:06:07,190 --> 03:06:08,710
The floor might cave, you know.

3949
03:06:17,160 --> 03:06:17,960
More bullets.

3950
03:06:21,100 --> 03:06:22,400
And then this one...

3951
03:06:22,400 --> 03:06:23,860
And then this one...

3952
03:06:23,860 --> 03:06:26,760
Is the third end.

3953
03:06:27,100 --> 03:06:27,420
Is the third end.

3954
03:06:27,420 --> 03:06:27,420
Okay.

3955
03:06:27,500 --> 03:06:29,100
So now we're on the third end.

3956
03:06:29,160 --> 03:06:29,720
We go north.

3957
03:06:31,600 --> 03:06:32,660
I'll save eventually.

3958
03:06:32,860 --> 03:06:33,360
Don't worry.

3959
03:06:35,100 --> 03:06:37,160
I'll save right here.

3960
03:06:39,940 --> 03:06:40,960
I'll save right here.

3961
03:06:44,080 --> 03:06:44,640
Yeah.

3962
03:06:46,760 --> 03:06:47,320
Okay.

3963
03:06:47,520 --> 03:06:49,660
Actually, I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

3964
03:06:49,660 --> 03:06:51,440
I'm gonna go potty for real.

3965
03:06:51,660 --> 03:06:52,800
I'm gonna go potty for real.

3966
03:06:53,180 --> 03:06:54,220
Nothing here.

3967
03:06:54,660 --> 03:06:55,660
I'm gonna go potty for real.

3968
03:06:57,040 --> 03:06:58,940
BRB like a minute.

3969
03:08:48,140 --> 03:08:48,700
Okay.

3970
03:08:49,300 --> 03:08:49,860
Okay.

3971
03:08:49,860 --> 03:08:50,480
I'm back.

3972
03:08:50,600 --> 03:08:51,060
Alright.

3973
03:08:57,360 --> 03:08:59,480
Let's take out some ghosts.

3974
03:09:00,340 --> 03:09:00,500
Yeah.

3975
03:09:00,680 --> 03:09:01,220
Yeah.

3976
03:09:01,360 --> 03:09:01,920
Yeah.

3977
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:02,420
Yeah.

3978
03:09:02,460 --> 03:09:02,900
I'm back.

3979
03:09:02,900 --> 03:09:03,820
I'm back.

3980
03:09:12,080 --> 03:09:12,680
Oh.

3981
03:09:13,240 --> 03:09:14,740
They just suck my health.

3982
03:09:15,040 --> 03:09:16,080
They suck me dry.

3983
03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:17,720
See?

3984
03:09:18,640 --> 03:09:20,920
That's what happens when a ghost touches you.

3985
03:09:21,320 --> 03:09:23,100
So you don't want a ghost to touch you.

3986
03:09:25,440 --> 03:09:26,640
So you don't want a ghost to touch you.

3987
03:09:26,640 --> 03:09:28,800
Just get, you know, sucked dry.

3988
03:09:29,500 --> 03:09:29,600
Just get, you know, sucked dry.

3989
03:09:31,460 --> 03:09:34,840
How do I do this?

3990
03:09:37,540 --> 03:09:38,740
How do I do this?

3991
03:09:44,680 --> 03:09:45,080
So...

3992
03:09:45,080 --> 03:09:47,040
I don't remember which one we're on.

3993
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:49,120
This is the fourth end, right?

3994
03:09:49,200 --> 03:09:50,060
So we'll go north?

3995
03:09:50,800 --> 03:09:51,820
We'll go north, right?

3996
03:09:54,680 --> 03:09:55,900
Wait, but there's an intersection.

3997
03:09:56,160 --> 03:09:56,320
Wait.

3998
03:10:02,610 --> 03:10:04,050
So what if I just run for it?

3999
03:10:06,270 --> 03:10:07,030
It worked.

4000
03:10:07,530 --> 03:10:08,270
It worked.

4001
03:10:08,270 --> 03:10:08,570
It worked.

4002
03:10:09,530 --> 03:10:09,930
Yeah.

4003
03:10:18,370 --> 03:10:19,370
That was close.

4004
03:10:19,370 --> 03:10:19,610
That was close.

4005
03:10:26,480 --> 03:10:26,960
Okay.

4006
03:10:27,140 --> 03:10:27,620
Now...

4007
03:10:28,520 --> 03:10:29,580
We go east.

4008
03:10:29,900 --> 03:10:30,280
Wait, huh?

4009
03:10:33,260 --> 03:10:34,220
Oh, yes.

4010
03:10:34,420 --> 03:10:35,080
We go east.

4011
03:10:35,260 --> 03:10:35,480
Okay.

4012
03:10:36,480 --> 03:10:36,960
Nice.

4013
03:10:49,990 --> 03:10:52,790
Please don't level drain or constitution drain us.

4014
03:10:53,190 --> 03:10:53,930
Don't worry.

4015
03:10:57,110 --> 03:10:58,210
We go south.

4016
03:10:58,430 --> 03:11:00,170
Oh, we're going into the room with the ghosts.

4017
03:11:05,190 --> 03:11:05,670
We go south.

4018
03:11:05,670 --> 03:11:05,670
Oh, we're going into the room with the ghosts.

4019
03:11:05,690 --> 03:11:06,930
From here...

4020
03:11:11,270 --> 03:11:11,830
East.

4021
03:11:12,190 --> 03:11:12,550
Okay.

4022
03:11:13,470 --> 03:11:14,030
East.

4023
03:11:23,050 --> 03:11:23,850
Oh, okay.

4024
03:11:23,910 --> 03:11:25,330
Going off the different screen...

4025
03:11:25,330 --> 03:11:26,910
Allows you to...

4026
03:11:27,690 --> 03:11:27,970
To...

4027
03:11:29,230 --> 03:11:30,530
Stop the ghost effects.

4028
03:11:36,310 --> 03:11:37,430
Holy moly.

4029
03:11:39,330 --> 03:11:40,710
This one is east, right?

4030
03:11:44,160 --> 03:11:45,080
Another ghost.

4031
03:11:46,340 --> 03:11:46,780
Um...

4032
03:11:49,640 --> 03:11:50,080
Wait.

4033
03:11:51,100 --> 03:11:51,540
South?

4034
03:11:53,420 --> 03:11:55,360
Wait, which S and E...

4035
03:11:55,360 --> 03:11:55,720
Wait, okay.

4036
03:11:55,860 --> 03:11:57,200
We're on the double S's.

4037
03:11:57,280 --> 03:11:58,360
So south, south, right?

4038
03:11:58,800 --> 03:11:59,820
South, south.

4039
03:12:00,120 --> 03:12:00,560
Yeah.

4040
03:12:01,380 --> 03:12:02,100
South, south.

4041
03:12:03,740 --> 03:12:04,180
Shoot.

4042
03:12:07,310 --> 03:12:08,190
Oh, south.

4043
03:12:08,310 --> 03:12:08,510
Okay.

4044
03:12:16,240 --> 03:12:17,000
First aid kit.

4045
03:12:17,160 --> 03:12:17,520
I'll take it.

4046
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:20,040
South...

4047
03:12:20,040 --> 03:12:21,400
Then here, south.

4048
03:12:24,660 --> 03:12:26,200
That was close.

4049
03:12:27,240 --> 03:12:27,920
South.

4050
03:12:29,740 --> 03:12:31,220
Can you punch the ghost?

4051
03:12:31,660 --> 03:12:32,620
I don't know.

4052
03:12:34,660 --> 03:12:37,240
I don't know about that one.

4053
03:12:39,860 --> 03:12:41,600
Wait, I only have...

4054
03:12:43,740 --> 03:12:45,520
Oh, I do not have any more bullets.

4055
03:12:46,580 --> 03:12:47,500
Uh-oh.

4056
03:12:49,840 --> 03:12:50,920
Uh-oh.

4057
03:12:57,400 --> 03:12:58,260
Oh, shoot.

4058
03:12:58,560 --> 03:12:58,860
Oh, shoot.

4059
03:13:04,460 --> 03:13:06,080
We're on the second south, right?

4060
03:13:07,160 --> 03:13:08,580
We're on the second south, right?

4061
03:13:11,080 --> 03:13:11,640
We're on the second south, right?

4062
03:13:14,250 --> 03:13:16,090
Time to find out if ghosts are punchable.

4063
03:13:16,230 --> 03:13:16,970
Yeah, for real.

4064
03:13:19,130 --> 03:13:20,530
So I go south again?

4065
03:13:29,240 --> 03:13:31,340
Enough to kill one ghost.

4066
03:13:31,700 --> 03:13:33,520
Enough to

4067
03:13:43,050 --> 03:13:43,930
kill one ghost.

4068
03:13:43,930 --> 03:13:44,230
South again.

4069
03:13:45,690 --> 03:13:47,610
I did one too many souths.

4070
03:13:47,610 --> 03:13:47,950
No!

4071
03:13:49,190 --> 03:13:49,910
Oh, gosh.

4072
03:13:50,230 --> 03:13:51,450
This is really bad.

4073
03:13:51,570 --> 03:13:52,670
Because now I don't know...

4074
03:13:53,310 --> 03:13:54,130
Oh, shoot.

4075
03:13:55,110 --> 03:13:56,270
I don't know...

4076
03:13:56,270 --> 03:13:57,370
Oh, no.

4077
03:13:57,430 --> 03:13:58,690
I don't know which one we're on.

4078
03:14:00,130 --> 03:14:01,010
Oh, no.

4079
03:14:04,280 --> 03:14:05,240
This is the...

4080
03:14:05,820 --> 03:14:06,660
Okay, hold on.

4081
03:14:06,760 --> 03:14:07,620
Maybe I can just remember.

4082
03:14:09,420 --> 03:14:09,860
Ah!

4083
03:14:18,290 --> 03:14:20,010
Then I go east and...

4084
03:14:21,310 --> 03:14:22,830
East and then south.

4085
03:14:23,470 --> 03:14:24,570
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4086
03:14:25,110 --> 03:14:26,110
We're okay, okay, okay.

4087
03:14:26,330 --> 03:14:27,490
We're good, we're good, we're good.

4088
03:14:41,470 --> 03:14:41,870
We're...

4089
03:14:41,870 --> 03:14:42,270
We're...

4090
03:14:42,270 --> 03:14:43,030
Maybe okay.

4091
03:14:48,270 --> 03:14:49,550
I'm gonna figure out...

4092
03:14:49,550 --> 03:14:51,050
I'm gonna see if they're punchable right now.

4093
03:14:55,270 --> 03:14:57,110
I guess we'll figure out if they're punchable.

4094
03:14:57,270 --> 03:14:57,990
Like, right?

4095
03:15:01,090 --> 03:15:01,610
Now.

4096
03:15:01,730 --> 03:15:02,170
Now.

4097
03:15:02,590 --> 03:15:03,750
I don't think they're punchable!

4098
03:15:07,650 --> 03:15:09,190
I don't think they're punchable!

4099
03:15:09,770 --> 03:15:12,470
I go east here and then I go south, south.

4100
03:15:27,890 --> 03:15:30,410
I might use this just so I can recover faster.

4101
03:15:32,670 --> 03:15:34,670
Just so I can recover more quickly.

4102
03:15:35,210 --> 03:15:35,250
Just so I can recover more quickly.

4103
03:15:37,330 --> 03:15:38,830
Does the slingshot work?

4104
03:15:39,190 --> 03:15:39,510
Does the slingshot work?

4105
03:15:46,720 --> 03:15:47,180
Hopefully...

4106
03:15:47,180 --> 03:15:47,620
Hopefully...

4107
03:15:49,580 --> 03:15:51,900
But it's slow, as you can tell.

4108
03:15:52,080 --> 03:15:53,440
It's slow, slow, slow.

4109
03:15:54,580 --> 03:15:56,180
It's really slow.

4110
03:16:10,320 --> 03:16:11,820
Okay, I hit him once, I think.

4111
03:16:23,100 --> 03:16:24,600
It does hurt them, yeah.

4112
03:16:25,780 --> 03:16:29,010
What the?

4113
03:16:29,250 --> 03:16:31,110
Oh no, it's not just three hits though.

4114
03:16:31,110 --> 03:16:33,290
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

4115
03:16:33,790 --> 03:16:35,190
It's not just three hits though.

4116
03:16:37,670 --> 03:16:39,170
Oh, it is...

4117
03:16:39,170 --> 03:16:42,170
Okay, this is quite bad actually.

4118
03:16:48,840 --> 03:16:51,020
I don't think it should reset it.

4119
03:16:51,260 --> 03:16:52,120
I don't think so.

4120
03:16:57,360 --> 03:16:58,140
They reset?

4121
03:16:58,440 --> 03:16:58,960
Wait, for real?

4122
03:17:04,300 --> 03:17:04,780
Seriously?

4123
03:17:04,780 --> 03:17:07,240
Okay, I'm just gonna shoot him then.

4124
03:17:13,100 --> 03:17:14,660
It really resets?

4125
03:17:15,720 --> 03:17:16,480
Okay.

4126
03:17:18,200 --> 03:17:19,120
Oh gosh.

4127
03:17:23,860 --> 03:17:26,160
Okay, so from here...

4128
03:17:27,800 --> 03:17:28,940
It's south-south.

4129
03:17:40,110 --> 03:17:40,870
South...

4130
03:17:43,670 --> 03:17:44,710
First I get nice.

4131
03:17:46,710 --> 03:17:48,330
South and then...

4132
03:17:51,310 --> 03:17:52,930
Prince K, thank you for the five.

4133
03:17:52,990 --> 03:17:53,830
You have to thank you!

4134
03:18:01,360 --> 03:18:02,340
How many bullets?

4135
03:18:02,500 --> 03:18:02,860
Okay, six.

4136
03:18:04,840 --> 03:18:05,320
Okay.

4137
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:08,180
Okay, south here.

4138
03:18:13,280 --> 03:18:14,180
And then...

4139
03:18:15,120 --> 03:18:15,600
North.

4140
03:18:19,320 --> 03:18:19,800
Okay.

4141
03:18:25,720 --> 03:18:26,680
Then north.

4142
03:18:27,220 --> 03:18:29,380
If I'm counting time correctly, according to this game...

4143
03:18:29,380 --> 03:18:33,880
We can head-pat Minto for about 20 seconds before she drains all the life from our body worth.

4144
03:18:35,120 --> 03:18:36,020
Stop it!

4145
03:18:39,100 --> 03:18:40,320
But get the bullets.

4146
03:18:41,960 --> 03:18:43,040
Okay, here...

4147
03:18:44,440 --> 03:18:45,040
Is...

4148
03:18:46,420 --> 03:18:47,020
North...

4149
03:18:47,020 --> 03:18:47,860
North.

4150
03:18:48,600 --> 03:18:49,980
So double north.

4151
03:18:52,040 --> 03:18:52,640
Okay.

4152
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:54,600
North...

4153
03:18:55,660 --> 03:18:56,260
North.

4154
03:18:56,760 --> 03:18:58,380
Wait, so north here.

4155
03:19:03,380 --> 03:19:03,860
Minto...

4156
03:19:03,860 --> 03:19:04,920
Punching goes supply to Minto.

4157
03:19:05,100 --> 03:19:06,260
No you can't punch these guys.

4158
03:19:06,280 --> 03:19:06,880
You can't punch me.

4159
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:08,020
So north.

4160
03:19:11,340 --> 03:19:12,300
And then...

4161
03:19:16,610 --> 03:19:18,110
This is the last...

4162
03:19:18,110 --> 03:19:18,870
North.

4163
03:19:19,770 --> 03:19:21,190
This is the last north.

4164
03:19:23,110 --> 03:19:23,590
No!

4165
03:19:31,080 --> 03:19:33,260
I think something ate me, but I'm not sure what.

4166
03:19:36,870 --> 03:19:37,350
Here...

4167
03:19:37,350 --> 03:19:38,770
Here... is east.

4168
03:19:39,230 --> 03:19:39,590
Right?

4169
03:19:39,670 --> 03:19:39,970
Save?

4170
03:19:40,090 --> 03:19:40,710
Yeah, good idea.

4171
03:19:42,570 --> 03:19:43,550
Oh, we can't.

4172
03:19:43,550 --> 03:19:44,730
Because of the ghost down there.

4173
03:19:44,950 --> 03:19:45,550
Okay, hold on.

4174
03:19:49,340 --> 03:19:50,300
Okay, we're saved.

4175
03:19:50,860 --> 03:19:52,180
Okay, we're saved, we're saved.

4176
03:19:57,940 --> 03:19:59,520
So now here...

4177
03:20:05,170 --> 03:20:06,910
That's not the one I was aiming for, but...

4178
03:20:07,950 --> 03:20:09,510
In the end, it works out!

4179
03:20:10,550 --> 03:20:12,310
Here we go!

4180
03:20:13,190 --> 03:20:13,650
East!

4181
03:20:21,250 --> 03:20:22,170
Fifteen.

4182
03:20:22,330 --> 03:20:23,150
Okay.

4183
03:20:27,150 --> 03:20:29,210
East and then north.

4184
03:20:32,830 --> 03:20:33,750
That's

4185
03:20:38,580 --> 03:20:38,640
me.

4186
03:20:45,680 --> 03:20:46,840
We east?

4187
03:20:49,660 --> 03:20:50,640
I go east here?

4188
03:20:51,060 --> 03:20:55,060
No, I go east...

4189
03:20:57,320 --> 03:20:58,800
I go north here.

4190
03:20:59,280 --> 03:20:59,800
Right?

4191
03:21:00,720 --> 03:21:01,620
Because we...

4192
03:21:02,880 --> 03:21:05,580
We went east here.

4193
03:21:05,940 --> 03:21:07,160
We went east here.

4194
03:21:07,800 --> 03:21:09,040
And then we went...

4195
03:21:09,040 --> 03:21:10,060
And then we go north here.

4196
03:21:14,550 --> 03:21:15,790
And then we go...

4197
03:21:17,250 --> 03:21:18,030
West here.

4198
03:21:22,520 --> 03:21:23,820
Then we go west here.

4199
03:21:25,480 --> 03:21:25,960
Yeah.

4200
03:21:26,060 --> 03:21:26,800
West, west.

4201
03:21:27,820 --> 03:21:28,580
Weest, weest.

4202
03:21:32,360 --> 03:21:33,180
Weest, weest.

4203
03:21:36,930 --> 03:21:37,410
Weest.

4204
03:21:44,940 --> 03:21:45,740
Double ghost.

4205
03:21:52,770 --> 03:21:53,250
And...

4206
03:21:54,150 --> 03:21:55,570
Then we go north here.

4207
03:21:55,810 --> 03:21:56,990
Okay, we're almost there, guys.

4208
03:21:57,070 --> 03:21:57,550
We're almost there.

4209
03:21:59,130 --> 03:22:00,350
I go north here.

4210
03:22:04,270 --> 03:22:06,490
North here, and then we do...

4211
03:22:08,070 --> 03:22:08,970
East...

4212
03:22:08,970 --> 03:22:10,450
North, north.

4213
03:22:10,770 --> 03:22:12,470
East, north, north.

4214
03:22:23,560 --> 03:22:24,960
North...

4215
03:22:24,960 --> 03:22:27,660
North.

4216
03:22:39,500 --> 03:22:41,600
Like turkey...

4217
03:22:41,600 --> 03:22:43,000
And...

4218
03:22:43,660 --> 03:22:44,220
And...

4219
03:22:45,400 --> 03:22:45,960
Turkey!

4220
03:22:51,290 --> 03:22:51,850
Turkey!

4221
03:22:52,010 --> 03:22:53,090
Almost got all the secrets.

4222
03:22:53,430 --> 03:22:53,670
Almost got all the secrets.

4223
03:22:53,870 --> 03:22:54,430
Yippee!

4224
03:22:58,350 --> 03:23:00,390
Final chapter escape complete!

4225
03:23:01,070 --> 03:23:02,470
Alright guys, this is it.

4226
03:23:02,530 --> 03:23:05,290
I entered the secret door and left those dungeons behind.

4227
03:23:06,230 --> 03:23:09,070
Ahead of me was a less dank portion of the basement.

4228
03:23:09,070 --> 03:23:09,890
Thank goodness.

4229
03:23:09,910 --> 03:23:15,170
According to Mike, there had to be an elevator somewhere Yes,

4230
03:23:19,430 --> 03:23:20,950
that we will take to leave.

4231
03:23:22,830 --> 03:23:24,830
X on the door, yes.

4232
03:23:27,390 --> 03:23:27,910
Yes.

4233
03:23:29,550 --> 03:23:31,770
Got a hold of the key.

4234
03:23:32,290 --> 03:23:32,810
Okay.

4235
03:23:35,490 --> 03:23:36,410
What's dank goodness?

4236
03:23:37,330 --> 03:23:38,350
What's a dank goodness?

4237
03:23:38,530 --> 03:23:39,390
Explore the basement.

4238
03:23:40,110 --> 03:23:41,210
Alright, and it's saved!

4239
03:23:44,720 --> 03:23:46,000
Escape complete!

4240
03:23:54,160 --> 03:23:55,260
Oh, what's this?

4241
03:23:55,840 --> 03:23:58,820
We got some C1!

4242
03:24:03,620 --> 03:24:04,460
Yes!

4243
03:24:05,540 --> 03:24:07,420
The music in here is so creepy.

4244
03:24:07,700 --> 03:24:08,880
What is this?

4245
03:24:09,760 --> 03:24:10,600
Piano...

4246
03:24:11,440 --> 03:24:14,040
This grate is so gross and grimy.

4247
03:24:15,180 --> 03:24:16,860
C1, C2...

4248
03:24:17,940 --> 03:24:18,440
C3...

4249
03:24:18,440 --> 03:24:20,360
Maybe I can blow it up with the C1.

4250
03:24:25,760 --> 03:24:27,320
You guys, C2 is overrated.

4251
03:24:27,980 --> 03:24:29,320
C3, never heard of her.

4252
03:24:29,840 --> 03:24:30,640
There's the X!

4253
03:24:31,280 --> 03:24:32,440
There's the X on the door.

4254
03:24:34,880 --> 03:24:36,940
It's very quiet down here.

4255
03:24:38,440 --> 03:24:39,620
My better half.

4256
03:24:41,900 --> 03:24:44,040
You've been featured in quite a few games!

4257
03:24:45,340 --> 03:24:46,500
Recently, haven't you?

4258
03:24:49,220 --> 03:24:49,780
C2...

4259
03:24:50,620 --> 03:24:51,180
C2...

4260
03:24:52,840 --> 03:24:54,160
Oh my gosh!

4261
03:24:54,200 --> 03:24:55,520
It's the commercial with all the AI.

4262
03:24:55,640 --> 03:24:58,180
To describe it, it's like a real lady.

4263
03:24:58,340 --> 03:25:03,040
But then the background of the commercial is all made with AI.

4264
03:25:03,280 --> 03:25:07,620
And then they end the commercial with an AI character of the lady.

4265
03:25:08,400 --> 03:25:09,660
What is happening?

4266
03:25:09,720 --> 03:25:10,940
Why is it all AI?

4267
03:25:13,260 --> 03:25:13,820
Oh!

4268
03:25:19,560 --> 03:25:20,400
My bad.

4269
03:25:21,160 --> 03:25:21,720
My

4270
03:25:31,640 --> 03:25:31,700
bad.

4271
03:25:31,840 --> 03:25:33,080
I just, uh...

4272
03:25:37,200 --> 03:25:37,760
Um...

4273
03:25:38,940 --> 03:25:40,280
Everything is punchable.

4274
03:25:45,640 --> 03:25:47,360
Everything is punchable.

4275
03:25:47,480 --> 03:25:48,740
Just makes it, you know...

4276
03:25:49,760 --> 03:25:51,900
Makes me want to punch everything.

4277
03:25:52,340 --> 03:25:55,120
Even if it literally causes my downfall.

4278
03:25:55,200 --> 03:25:56,080
Even if it literally causes my downfall.

4279
03:25:56,100 --> 03:26:02,140
Objectively, now that I'm thinking about it, like, I could have looked at that and been like, that looks like a gas tank.

4280
03:26:02,300 --> 03:26:04,480
If I punch it, it will probably explode.

4281
03:26:04,760 --> 03:26:04,840
There it was.

4282
03:26:04,840 --> 03:26:06,280
General X's private elevator.

4283
03:26:06,740 --> 03:26:06,940
Yeah.

4284
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:10,620
But it looks like I need a key!

4285
03:26:11,680 --> 03:26:13,660
And there's also the door with the X on it.

4286
03:26:16,820 --> 03:26:17,760
Let's go back this way.

4287
03:26:21,450 --> 03:26:23,030
Let's get more C1.

4288
03:26:24,950 --> 03:26:26,410
Why look when you can punch?

4289
03:26:26,570 --> 03:26:29,930
What if I exploded with the C1?

4290
03:26:33,650 --> 03:26:35,810
What do you think C3 will be like?

4291
03:26:41,310 --> 03:26:43,250
What do you think C3 will be like?

4292
03:26:43,490 --> 03:26:43,970
Stamina!

4293
03:26:46,330 --> 03:26:48,010
I just thought it looked a little suspicious.

4294
03:26:48,950 --> 03:26:49,910
Punch everything.

4295
03:26:51,290 --> 03:26:53,230
See, this is why I punch things!

4296
03:27:05,410 --> 03:27:08,130
Like, there's probably something right here that I need to get to.

4297
03:27:08,710 --> 03:27:09,110
Right?

4298
03:27:11,730 --> 03:27:14,430
If you hadn't noticed it was a gas tank, you would have punched it anyway.

4299
03:27:15,250 --> 03:27:15,730
Yes!

4300
03:27:17,550 --> 03:27:20,950
A door marked with an X, just like Robert told me.

4301
03:27:21,410 --> 03:27:22,410
There it was.

4302
03:27:22,810 --> 03:27:25,750
The secret room where they kept the helicopter key.

4303
03:27:26,210 --> 03:27:29,850
Why would they keep a key in such a creepy place instead of an office?

4304
03:27:30,090 --> 03:27:30,130
Creepy.

4305
03:27:30,370 --> 03:27:33,270
The more I thought about it, the more things fell down the place.

4306
03:27:33,270 --> 03:27:34,670
I was gonna say, do we trust Robert?

4307
03:27:34,930 --> 03:27:36,210
I had a strange feeling.

4308
03:27:36,390 --> 03:27:36,590
Yeah.

4309
03:27:36,590 --> 03:27:38,930
Like a gut feeling that something was just...

4310
03:27:38,930 --> 03:27:39,710
wrong.

4311
03:27:39,870 --> 03:27:41,070
Do we trust Robert?

4312
03:27:43,290 --> 03:27:43,810
Because...

4313
03:27:48,810 --> 03:27:50,030
we do not.

4314
03:27:51,510 --> 03:27:52,930
I don't know if we do.

4315
03:27:53,650 --> 03:27:55,570
Let me go check this elevator real quick.

4316
03:27:57,390 --> 03:28:00,770
Okay, so we do need a different key for it.

4317
03:28:02,170 --> 03:28:04,050
It just saved, so why not look inside?

4318
03:28:04,330 --> 03:28:07,830
Yeah, yeah, I just wanted to go check the other area first.

4319
03:28:12,310 --> 03:28:12,910
Ah!

4320
03:28:13,870 --> 03:28:15,190
Mr. Fox.

4321
03:28:15,570 --> 03:28:16,030
Oh my god.

4322
03:28:16,930 --> 03:28:17,530
Um...

4323
03:28:18,110 --> 03:28:19,730
You have finally arrived.

4324
03:28:20,410 --> 03:28:21,610
General X?

4325
03:28:21,970 --> 03:28:22,910
The same.

4326
03:28:23,230 --> 03:28:25,710
Are you searching for a key, Mr. Fox?

4327
03:28:25,730 --> 03:28:26,250
Who told you?

4328
03:28:26,350 --> 03:28:28,070
Perhaps one for a helicopter?

4329
03:28:28,070 --> 03:28:28,870
Who told you?

4330
03:28:29,070 --> 03:28:31,570
You won't find it here, Mr. Fox.

4331
03:28:31,890 --> 03:28:35,070
I'm afraid that your contact has betrayed you.

4332
03:28:37,050 --> 03:28:38,130
Don't blame him.

4333
03:28:38,230 --> 03:28:40,230
He's been the victim of my...

4334
03:28:40,230 --> 03:28:41,870
We know.

4335
03:28:42,110 --> 03:28:45,330
Right there, in front of me, was General X.

4336
03:28:45,690 --> 03:28:48,390
The puppet master of Operation Jericho.

4337
03:28:48,830 --> 03:28:56,450
Not only was he a merciless, psychopathic asshole, he was so smart that he could predict my every move.

4338
03:28:56,490 --> 03:29:01,250
Okay, I was not reading, so I thought he was going to say he was so sexy.

4339
03:29:01,750 --> 03:29:05,130
You had us waiting longer than expected, Mr. Fox.

4340
03:29:05,270 --> 03:29:06,950
I did keep you waiting.

4341
03:29:07,990 --> 03:29:09,930
I would have come sooner.

4342
03:29:10,310 --> 03:29:13,510
That would remove a certain charm, don't you think?

4343
03:29:13,650 --> 03:29:15,890
By the way, I brought some company.

4344
03:29:18,010 --> 03:29:18,650
Sexy!

4345
03:29:19,130 --> 03:29:21,710
I see you're already acquainted.

4346
03:29:22,030 --> 03:29:23,330
He's so sexy.

4347
03:29:24,430 --> 03:29:28,010
Surrender, otherwise we'll start executing on you.

4348
03:29:28,490 --> 03:29:30,150
There were too many people.

4349
03:29:30,350 --> 03:29:33,870
If I opened fire, Harris and the Doctor could die.

4350
03:29:34,150 --> 03:29:40,510
Let me guess, you're considering the option of shooting, but you know that Harris and the Doctor could die.

4351
03:29:42,110 --> 03:29:43,930
Oh my gosh, he's Psycho Mantis!

4352
03:29:44,170 --> 03:29:46,170
But that asshole X was a clean shot.

4353
03:29:46,350 --> 03:29:47,030
Yeah, we could take him down.

4354
03:29:47,030 --> 03:29:49,390
If I shot quickly, I could kill him.

4355
03:29:49,650 --> 03:29:53,470
Now you're probably thinking I'm stupid for being so exposed.

4356
03:29:53,690 --> 03:29:56,090
And that you can kill me with a quick enough shot.

4357
03:29:56,310 --> 03:30:00,570
If you shoot and kill me, that would be the end of the final boss.

4358
03:30:00,950 --> 03:30:03,490
Of all of this, you'd be a hero.

4359
03:30:03,730 --> 03:30:08,310
Do you really have such a low opinion of my intellect, Mr. Fox?

4360
03:30:09,010 --> 03:30:09,470
Shit.

4361
03:30:09,850 --> 03:30:11,290
This was part of his plan.

4362
03:30:12,110 --> 03:30:13,050
He was here on purpose.

4363
03:30:13,390 --> 03:30:16,510
I was thinking that he might have worn a bulletproof vest.

4364
03:30:16,570 --> 03:30:17,370
The name for the face.

4365
03:30:17,570 --> 03:30:21,090
By now you should be thinking that I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.

4366
03:30:21,330 --> 03:30:24,430
Shooting an armored man would be foolish, don't you think?

4367
03:30:25,290 --> 03:30:27,350
He read my mind once again.

4368
03:30:27,730 --> 03:30:31,030
But even if his body was covered, his head was not.

4369
03:30:31,650 --> 03:30:34,330
One bullet between his eyes and goodbye.

4370
03:30:34,350 --> 03:30:34,890
Wait, wait, wait.

4371
03:30:35,130 --> 03:30:37,250
But you're not a quitter, Mr. Fox.

4372
03:30:37,590 --> 03:30:40,970
It's only logical that you'd consider shooting me in the head.

4373
03:30:41,010 --> 03:30:41,670
Oh my god.

4374
03:30:42,930 --> 03:30:44,610
Just shoot him while he's talking.

4375
03:30:45,390 --> 03:30:47,370
An Olympian trial of marksmanship.

4376
03:30:48,170 --> 03:30:49,030
Reflexes and luck.

4377
03:30:49,190 --> 03:30:50,850
Let me spare you the trouble.

4378
03:30:51,310 --> 03:30:51,830
Sergeant.

4379
03:30:52,530 --> 03:30:53,250
Yes, sir.

4380
03:30:53,810 --> 03:30:55,050
Shoot me in the head.

4381
03:30:55,270 --> 03:30:56,450
Point blank range.

4382
03:30:57,550 --> 03:30:58,070
Sir.

4383
03:30:58,490 --> 03:31:00,830
That doesn't sound like a mic.

4384
03:31:01,290 --> 03:31:02,090
Yes, sir.

4385
03:31:02,330 --> 03:31:03,330
That doesn't sound like a mic?

4386
03:31:03,430 --> 03:31:03,950
Who are you?

4387
03:31:04,770 --> 03:31:06,810
The bullet went through his head.

4388
03:31:07,010 --> 03:31:08,850
But the bastard was unfazed.

4389
03:31:09,330 --> 03:31:10,870
Return to your post, Sergeant.

4390
03:31:11,130 --> 03:31:11,930
Yes, sir.

4391
03:31:12,110 --> 03:31:13,270
Oh, could you do that again?

4392
03:31:13,390 --> 03:31:14,590
But, like, take two steps forward?

4393
03:31:15,370 --> 03:31:18,530
What you're staring at in awe, Mr. Fox...

4394
03:31:18,530 --> 03:31:19,390
It's a hologram.

4395
03:31:19,490 --> 03:31:20,010
Yep.

4396
03:31:20,390 --> 03:31:22,290
A hologram.

4397
03:31:22,330 --> 03:31:29,450
Mr. Fox, and now that it's obvious that you can't kill me, let's conclude the matter of your surrender.

4398
03:31:29,750 --> 03:31:33,130
Or are there not enough dead bodies to convince you?

4399
03:31:33,290 --> 03:31:37,270
Just give me ten seconds to think about it.

4400
03:31:37,350 --> 03:31:39,430
Ten seconds.

4401
03:31:41,050 --> 03:31:42,270
Harris or doctor?

4402
03:31:44,050 --> 03:31:44,690
Oh...

4403
03:31:47,290 --> 03:31:48,570
Oh, um...

4404
03:31:48,570 --> 03:31:48,730
Oh, um...

4405
03:31:52,270 --> 03:31:53,550
Oh, um...

4406
03:31:53,550 --> 03:31:53,670
Doctor.

4407
03:31:54,010 --> 03:31:54,550
She's sexy.

4408
03:31:54,830 --> 03:31:55,850
Kill the doctor.

4409
03:31:56,030 --> 03:32:03,230
I think we messed up.

4410
03:32:03,550 --> 03:32:03,570
I think we messed up.

4411
03:32:04,530 --> 03:32:05,810
I think we messed up.

4412
03:32:05,810 --> 03:32:06,830
I think we messed up.

4413
03:32:07,690 --> 03:32:08,330
Um...

4414
03:32:08,330 --> 03:32:08,350
Um...

4415
03:32:11,290 --> 03:32:12,930
What if I blow these up?

4416
03:32:13,170 --> 03:32:14,070
What if I blow these up?

4417
03:32:14,150 --> 03:32:14,550
Okay, hold on.

4418
03:32:15,730 --> 03:32:16,130
Whoa!

4419
03:32:17,330 --> 03:32:18,130
We have so many.

4420
03:32:21,050 --> 03:32:21,990
Minto, how could you?

4421
03:32:22,690 --> 03:32:23,470
I didn't know.

4422
03:32:23,970 --> 03:32:24,370
Oh.

4423
03:32:25,210 --> 03:32:26,350
How do I use this?

4424
03:32:27,730 --> 03:32:28,130
Nope.

4425
03:32:30,150 --> 03:32:31,650
It won't let me put it down.

4426
03:32:31,910 --> 03:32:33,410
I guess I can only put it down...

4427
03:32:34,870 --> 03:32:35,430
Combine them?

4428
03:32:35,530 --> 03:32:36,470
To make C2?

4429
03:32:36,470 --> 03:32:37,590
Oh!

4430
03:32:42,060 --> 03:32:43,020
That's so funny.

4431
03:32:44,040 --> 03:32:45,500
That's exactly how it works.

4432
03:32:48,040 --> 03:32:49,320
I'm wasting bullets.

4433
03:32:52,780 --> 03:32:53,540
No!

4434
03:32:56,000 --> 03:32:57,480
Can I make C3?

4435
03:32:58,140 --> 03:32:58,900
C4!

4436
03:33:03,980 --> 03:33:05,840
We finally have it!

4437
03:33:07,320 --> 03:33:11,560
To use the explosive, I needed something to act as a timer.

4438
03:33:12,340 --> 03:33:12,780
Ah...

4439
03:33:29,220 --> 03:33:30,300
When does it explode?

4440
03:33:31,400 --> 03:33:32,400
You're a genius, Minto.

4441
03:33:32,580 --> 03:33:33,180
Thank you.

4442
03:33:37,360 --> 03:33:39,540
Maybe I go to the...

4443
03:33:43,280 --> 03:33:44,160
No, um...

4444
03:33:52,220 --> 03:33:54,080
A close friend just passed it asleep today.

4445
03:33:54,080 --> 03:33:55,740
Aww, Jeff, I'm so sorry.

4446
03:33:58,440 --> 03:33:58,980
Aww...

4447
03:34:00,980 --> 03:34:02,180
I hope you're okay.

4448
03:34:02,980 --> 03:34:03,700
Check it.

4449
03:34:03,920 --> 03:34:05,040
It's gonna explode on me!

4450
03:34:06,280 --> 03:34:07,040
Punch it.

4451
03:34:08,180 --> 03:34:09,520
It did save.

4452
03:34:12,840 --> 03:34:13,380
Huh?

4453
03:34:14,140 --> 03:34:14,880
Let's just go.

4454
03:34:17,780 --> 03:34:18,320
Hmm...

4455
03:34:21,260 --> 03:34:22,660
We can skip all of this, though.

4456
03:34:22,660 --> 03:34:23,360
Mr. Fox.

4457
03:34:24,560 --> 03:34:25,840
Skip, skip, skip.

4458
03:34:27,040 --> 03:34:28,460
Shoot and shoot, shoot.

4459
03:34:28,680 --> 03:34:29,340
Skippy skip.

4460
03:34:30,480 --> 03:34:31,780
Oh, oh, uh-oh.

4461
03:34:33,360 --> 03:34:33,880
Um...

4462
03:34:37,540 --> 03:34:38,280
Watch out!

4463
03:34:39,180 --> 03:34:42,120
Have you already made up your mind, Mr. Fox?

4464
03:34:42,120 --> 03:34:42,540
Oopsie.

4465
03:34:42,840 --> 03:34:44,840
Yes, I've decided that.

4466
03:34:45,160 --> 03:34:45,780
Watch out!

4467
03:34:45,860 --> 03:34:46,700
Behind you!

4468
03:34:47,680 --> 03:34:51,980
Did you seriously think that I'd fall for such an old trick?

4469
03:34:52,240 --> 03:34:52,440
Did you seriously think that I'd fall for such an old trick?

4470
03:34:52,440 --> 03:34:54,380
For the record, I warned you.

4471
03:34:54,500 --> 03:34:55,000
Watch out!

4472
03:34:59,500 --> 03:34:59,980
Doctor!

4473
03:34:59,980 --> 03:35:00,920
Doctor, doctor!

4474
03:35:01,520 --> 03:35:02,020
I'm fine.

4475
03:35:02,560 --> 03:35:03,500
What happened?

4476
03:35:03,800 --> 03:35:04,680
An explosion.

4477
03:35:05,140 --> 03:35:06,780
The guard behind you... Me!

4478
03:35:06,940 --> 03:35:08,300
...received the brunt of it.

4479
03:35:08,740 --> 03:35:09,220
Colonel!

4480
03:35:09,700 --> 03:35:10,360
The Colonel, though.

4481
03:35:10,520 --> 03:35:11,840
We're gonna have to carry that guy.

4482
03:35:12,300 --> 03:35:12,780
Probably.

4483
03:35:13,360 --> 03:35:14,020
He's alive.

4484
03:35:14,320 --> 03:35:14,740
Okay, good.

4485
03:35:14,820 --> 03:35:15,920
Looks like he just blacked out.

4486
03:35:16,200 --> 03:35:18,600
We have to leave before reinforcements arrive.

4487
03:35:18,920 --> 03:35:20,400
I'm taking Harris with me.

4488
03:35:20,660 --> 03:35:22,180
It's best not to move him.

4489
03:35:22,320 --> 03:35:22,440
Oh.

4490
03:35:22,520 --> 03:35:25,160
We don't know if he has any fractures or internal wounds.

4491
03:35:25,560 --> 03:35:26,560
I'll take the risk.

4492
03:35:26,760 --> 03:35:27,960
He can't stay here.

4493
03:35:27,960 --> 03:35:29,160
It's true, it's true, it's true.

4494
03:35:29,760 --> 03:35:31,120
Leave with the Colonel.

4495
03:35:31,300 --> 03:35:31,420
Okay.

4496
03:35:32,780 --> 03:35:34,220
I'll teabag him a little bit.

4497
03:35:35,080 --> 03:35:35,580
Let's go.

4498
03:35:37,300 --> 03:35:38,320
Come on, Doctor!

4499
03:35:39,660 --> 03:35:40,140
No!

4500
03:35:40,340 --> 03:35:40,820
Doctor!

4501
03:35:41,400 --> 03:35:43,140
There are injured that require my attention.

4502
03:35:43,460 --> 03:35:44,660
She's doing a doctor.

4503
03:35:44,880 --> 03:35:45,520
And I don't want to leave my father alone.

4504
03:35:46,040 --> 03:35:46,400
What?

4505
03:35:46,840 --> 03:35:48,400
They were going to kill you.

4506
03:35:48,400 --> 03:35:49,000
She's a doctor.

4507
03:35:49,180 --> 03:35:51,920
It was just a trick to catch you.

4508
03:35:51,920 --> 03:35:55,860
And if I leave, my father won't work and they'll kill him.

4509
03:35:56,100 --> 03:35:56,580
Run!

4510
03:35:56,800 --> 03:35:57,380
Go away!

4511
03:35:57,940 --> 03:35:59,680
I'll come back for you with the cavalry.

4512
03:36:00,100 --> 03:36:01,280
You have my word.

4513
03:36:01,640 --> 03:36:04,340
I left that room carrying the Colonel.

4514
03:36:04,660 --> 03:36:05,440
On my back.

4515
03:36:05,580 --> 03:36:07,480
Wait, you're saying that you managed to rescue Colonel Harris?

4516
03:36:07,740 --> 03:36:08,160
Yeah!

4517
03:36:08,540 --> 03:36:08,720
That's correct.

4518
03:36:08,920 --> 03:36:13,400
Well, Mr. Fox, let's see what you invent to remove him from this story.

4519
03:36:15,380 --> 03:36:18,180
Lieutenant, we found a corpse in the remains of the helicopter!

4520
03:36:18,600 --> 03:36:18,980
What?

4521
03:36:19,140 --> 03:36:19,960
Who is he?

4522
03:36:20,140 --> 03:36:21,140
We don't know, Lieutenant.

4523
03:36:21,920 --> 03:36:23,760
It was totally carbonized by the fire.

4524
03:36:23,940 --> 03:36:24,760
Oh, my word!

4525
03:36:24,880 --> 03:36:26,100
Just for this guy to burn up!

4526
03:36:26,600 --> 03:36:26,880
Yesterday.

4527
03:36:27,180 --> 03:36:28,340
Do you understand me, Wachowski?

4528
03:36:29,220 --> 03:36:29,940
Yes, sir!

4529
03:36:32,100 --> 03:36:32,580
Fuck.

4530
03:36:32,580 --> 03:36:34,060
We killed Colonel Harris.

4531
03:36:34,560 --> 03:36:36,020
May God forgive us.

4532
03:36:36,360 --> 03:36:38,060
No, he's not Harris.

4533
03:36:38,180 --> 03:36:40,440
The Colonel died a month ago in an ambush.

4534
03:36:40,760 --> 03:36:41,060
No!

4535
03:36:41,360 --> 03:36:42,400
These are his personal belongings.

4536
03:36:42,640 --> 03:36:43,320
His dog tag.

4537
03:36:43,520 --> 03:36:43,980
His watch.

4538
03:36:44,160 --> 03:36:44,720
I'm telling you.

4539
03:36:44,720 --> 03:36:45,580
Don't you remember, Sergeant?

4540
03:36:45,680 --> 03:36:46,740
We found them on his corpse.

4541
03:36:47,020 --> 03:36:48,560
That man has never seen the Colonel.

4542
03:36:48,680 --> 03:36:50,500
He's just trying to confuse us with his lies.

4543
03:36:50,980 --> 03:36:51,700
Fuck's sake.

4544
03:36:51,920 --> 03:36:54,200
He has absolutely no evidence for what he's saying.

4545
03:36:54,300 --> 03:36:54,900
I have the body.

4546
03:36:54,920 --> 03:36:55,380
OK, I've got this.

4547
03:36:55,740 --> 03:36:57,460
What do I have?

4548
03:36:58,020 --> 03:36:58,800
What is that?

4549
03:36:59,700 --> 03:37:00,180
But...what?

4550
03:37:01,320 --> 03:37:06,220
If I'm not mistaken, it's a graduation ring for the 48th commission of officer-candidate high school.

4551
03:37:06,500 --> 03:37:06,860
If I'm not mistaken, it's a graduation ring for the 48th commission of officer-candidate high school.

4552
03:37:06,860 --> 03:37:07,820
Metal Gear plot plotting.

4553
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:11,800
The Colonel Harris graduated in the 48th commission of officer-candidate high school.

4554
03:37:12,040 --> 03:37:14,100
Sgt, you don't believe him, do you?

4555
03:37:14,260 --> 03:37:14,700
I do.

4556
03:37:14,780 --> 03:37:16,140
With all due respect, sir.

4557
03:37:16,280 --> 03:37:21,540
I only said that the Colonel Harris graduated in the 48th commission of officer-candidate high school.

4558
03:37:21,540 --> 03:37:21,900
Yeah!

4559
03:37:29,120 --> 03:37:29,420
Smell?

4560
03:37:31,000 --> 03:37:32,760
It smells like... turkey?

4561
03:37:33,280 --> 03:37:33,960
Oh, shit.

4562
03:37:35,720 --> 03:37:36,820
Wow, he got really excited.

4563
03:37:36,960 --> 03:37:37,900
He was like, it smells like shit.

4564
03:37:38,040 --> 03:37:38,600
I'm gonna smell it.

4565
03:37:52,520 --> 03:37:54,620
Mr. Fox, continue your story.

4566
03:37:54,800 --> 03:37:56,680
Let's see if we can finish this once and for all.

4567
03:38:02,860 --> 03:38:05,800
I just continue on without that information?

4568
03:38:06,060 --> 03:38:07,160
With knowing that now?

4569
03:38:12,460 --> 03:38:12,960
Oh,

4570
03:38:16,160 --> 03:38:16,660
shit.

4571
03:38:17,820 --> 03:38:18,680
They're all bleeding.

4572
03:38:18,720 --> 03:38:19,340
I don't have enough.

4573
03:38:21,400 --> 03:38:22,920
I messed up, I think.

4574
03:38:26,020 --> 03:38:27,480
I think I messed up.

4575
03:38:30,840 --> 03:38:31,280
Oh, wait.

4576
03:38:31,340 --> 03:38:32,300
I knocked only one of them out.

4577
03:38:32,420 --> 03:38:32,860
Oh, wait.

4578
03:38:33,020 --> 03:38:33,720
I can do this.

4579
03:38:33,800 --> 03:38:34,180
I can do this.

4580
03:38:42,320 --> 03:38:43,640
How do I knock one of them out?

4581
03:38:43,820 --> 03:38:44,400
Oh, never mind.

4582
03:38:44,600 --> 03:38:45,500
No, there's three of them.

4583
03:38:48,060 --> 03:38:48,640
Just kidding.

4584
03:38:52,220 --> 03:38:52,540
Okay.

4585
03:38:57,260 --> 03:38:57,580
Ouch!

4586
03:39:06,930 --> 03:39:07,250
Oops.

4587
03:39:07,390 --> 03:39:07,790
Oh my gosh.

4588
03:39:07,830 --> 03:39:09,150
I keep pressing the wrong...

4589
03:39:10,030 --> 03:39:10,430
Okay.

4590
03:39:11,310 --> 03:39:11,890
Come on.

4591
03:39:13,610 --> 03:39:14,130
Let's go.

4592
03:39:14,450 --> 03:39:16,550
Maybe... maybe we go up here, actually.

4593
03:39:19,210 --> 03:39:19,610
Nope.

4594
03:39:19,770 --> 03:39:21,350
Do we... is there anywhere to go in here?

4595
03:39:24,150 --> 03:39:25,210
The secret room!

4596
03:39:26,450 --> 03:39:28,430
We can hide in the secret room!

4597
03:39:30,730 --> 03:39:31,130
Okay.

4598
03:39:31,790 --> 03:39:32,830
Can I go see her?

4599
03:39:35,110 --> 03:39:36,350
Madam, I'm hurt... I'm injured.

4600
03:39:36,470 --> 03:39:37,750
Can I have your first aid kit, please?

4601
03:39:40,590 --> 03:39:41,110
Okay.

4602
03:39:41,230 --> 03:39:41,610
Here we go.

4603
03:39:42,950 --> 03:39:43,690
Oh, shoot.

4604
03:39:44,290 --> 03:39:45,370
I mean, don't.

4605
03:39:45,430 --> 03:39:46,290
I mean...

4606
03:40:04,780 --> 03:40:05,500
Dang it!

4607
03:40:12,870 --> 03:40:13,390
Close.

4608
03:40:14,370 --> 03:40:14,690
I know.

4609
03:40:14,770 --> 03:40:15,310
It's too slow.

4610
03:40:15,630 --> 03:40:16,250
It's too slow.

4611
03:40:17,430 --> 03:40:17,950
Okay.

4612
03:40:20,110 --> 03:40:21,290
If they come here...

4613
03:40:25,230 --> 03:40:25,930
Oh, wait.

4614
03:40:25,990 --> 03:40:26,850
I already had it attached.

4615
03:40:30,230 --> 03:40:30,630
Okay.

4616
03:40:30,870 --> 03:40:31,190
Hmm.

4617
03:40:35,360 --> 03:40:35,760
Okay.

4618
03:40:37,480 --> 03:40:37,880
Okay.

4619
03:40:39,060 --> 03:40:41,680
Maybe if I, like, ambush them first, you know?

4620
03:40:41,760 --> 03:40:42,680
Like, I make them come to me?

4621
03:40:45,220 --> 03:40:45,780
You know?

4622
03:40:47,280 --> 03:40:47,900
Like this?

4623
03:40:48,600 --> 03:40:49,280
Like, come here!

4624
03:40:53,760 --> 03:40:54,340
Like so?

4625
03:40:56,020 --> 03:40:56,760
You know?

4626
03:40:57,000 --> 03:40:57,780
Just run?

4627
03:40:58,000 --> 03:40:59,220
What do you mean, just run?

4628
03:40:59,480 --> 03:41:01,000
How am I supposed to get past them, then?

4629
03:41:01,120 --> 03:41:02,080
With this guy?

4630
03:41:02,640 --> 03:41:03,620
I'm too slow!

4631
03:41:10,900 --> 03:41:12,340
To the rooftop.

4632
03:41:13,400 --> 03:41:13,960
Right?

4633
03:41:14,080 --> 03:41:14,740
There we go!

4634
03:41:17,940 --> 03:41:18,500
Oh!

4635
03:41:20,260 --> 03:41:21,860
Oh, my God.

4636
03:41:27,840 --> 03:41:28,320
Oh, no!

4637
03:41:28,480 --> 03:41:28,780
Oh, not a big deal.

4638
03:41:28,780 --> 03:41:28,840
Hey, friend.

4639
03:41:29,140 --> 03:41:29,960
Don't look at me.

4640
03:41:30,180 --> 03:41:31,500
I haven't killed anyone.

4641
03:41:32,060 --> 03:41:33,400
I'm not your friend.

4642
03:41:33,660 --> 03:41:34,620
For fuck's sake.

4643
03:41:34,780 --> 03:41:35,460
Shut up.

4644
03:41:35,920 --> 03:41:36,360
Wachowski.

4645
03:41:36,540 --> 03:41:39,220
Send the bullet to Science Officer Hollister for analysis.

4646
03:41:39,620 --> 03:41:43,400
And tell him to collate it with the gun Mr. Fox had on him.

4647
03:41:43,500 --> 03:41:44,720
Maybe we'll have a surprise.

4648
03:41:45,280 --> 03:41:45,720
Oh.

4649
03:41:45,720 --> 03:41:47,320
I want the results of that five minutes ago.

4650
03:41:47,520 --> 03:41:47,960
Understood?

4651
03:41:48,280 --> 03:41:48,600
Oh, my God.

4652
03:41:48,640 --> 03:41:48,900
This guy!

4653
03:41:49,160 --> 03:41:49,580
Yes, sir.

4654
03:41:50,100 --> 03:41:51,620
I ran it five minutes ago.

4655
03:41:53,440 --> 03:41:53,880
Uh...

4656
03:41:54,860 --> 03:41:55,300
Wow!

4657
03:41:55,300 --> 03:41:59,040
That asshole General X had some cool music equipment.

4658
03:41:59,280 --> 03:42:00,080
On Metal Gear.

4659
03:42:00,140 --> 03:42:04,100
Multi-band equalizer, auto-amplified subwoofer, and...

4660
03:42:04,100 --> 03:42:05,240
No way.

4661
03:42:05,680 --> 03:42:06,240
No way.

4662
03:42:06,240 --> 03:42:07,820
Double-deck cassette player.

4663
03:42:08,180 --> 03:42:08,720
Oh my god.

4664
03:42:08,740 --> 03:42:11,640
Fuck, you could record directly from one cassette to another.

4665
03:42:11,640 --> 03:42:12,200
Oh my god, Wes, are you for this?

4666
03:42:12,200 --> 03:42:12,540
Super tight!

4667
03:42:14,000 --> 03:42:15,480
I see a water closet.

4668
03:42:15,740 --> 03:42:16,740
I also see...

4669
03:42:18,020 --> 03:42:19,480
That's our way out, I believe.

4670
03:42:19,640 --> 03:42:19,900
Oh, wait.

4671
03:42:20,020 --> 03:42:21,080
Where's that a secret room?

4672
03:42:22,040 --> 03:42:22,680
Hold on.

4673
03:42:23,020 --> 03:42:23,920
Hold on, Colonel.

4674
03:42:25,300 --> 03:42:25,680
One second.

4675
03:42:29,240 --> 03:42:30,560
One moment, please.

4676
03:42:30,680 --> 03:42:31,350
Why do you...

4677
03:42:31,980 --> 03:42:34,100
Oh, break all toilet doors!

4678
03:42:37,980 --> 03:42:39,340
I'm a menace!

4679
03:42:41,020 --> 03:42:44,120
I won't let anyone pee in peace.

4680
03:42:50,110 --> 03:42:50,690
Nice.

4681
03:42:51,010 --> 03:42:52,130
We need those for sure.

4682
03:42:52,250 --> 03:42:52,670
Oh, what's this?

4683
03:42:53,170 --> 03:42:53,750
Hi.

4684
03:42:53,890 --> 03:42:56,090
This is your netpick friend.

4685
03:42:56,370 --> 03:42:56,870
Welcome.

4686
03:42:56,950 --> 03:42:59,170
Welcome to the digital mini art book of Unmetal.

4687
03:43:01,190 --> 03:43:06,090
Unmetal is actually a port of an MSX game I created called Prisoner of War.

4688
03:43:08,430 --> 03:43:11,130
This is an early version of Unmetal's graphics.

4689
03:43:11,630 --> 03:43:13,710
At first, the action took place during the day.

4690
03:43:15,230 --> 03:43:19,350
After some thought, I asked Marcel to try a night version.

4691
03:43:19,610 --> 03:43:22,190
I liked it much more, and that's why Unmetal takes place overnight.

4692
03:43:23,830 --> 03:43:25,310
Does this look familiar to you?

4693
03:43:25,410 --> 03:43:25,650
Yeah.

4694
03:43:25,650 --> 03:43:29,290
This is the first mock-up for the intro that pays homage to the A-Team.

4695
03:43:30,970 --> 03:43:32,370
Oh, look at them!

4696
03:43:32,730 --> 03:43:35,690
At the beginning, we created a special screen for the Unmetal rules.

4697
03:43:36,030 --> 03:43:37,470
It was removed because it was too annoying.

4698
03:43:39,610 --> 03:43:41,630
My first idea was to have playable menus.

4699
03:43:42,450 --> 03:43:46,110
You would have to move without being spotted in order to change options.

4700
03:43:48,150 --> 03:43:52,650
In the sound room, you had to punch sliding boxes in order to change the volume.

4701
03:43:52,770 --> 03:43:54,250
This was all scrapped.

4702
03:43:57,520 --> 03:44:00,240
We created Jesse Fox for a project called Afraid.

4703
03:44:01,620 --> 03:44:04,720
Unfortunately, the Kickstarter campaign wasn't successful.

4704
03:44:05,120 --> 03:44:07,100
Oh my god!

4705
03:44:07,480 --> 03:44:09,500
This is the first concept for Jesse Fox.

4706
03:44:09,640 --> 03:44:15,480
He was a badass guy who was forced to work for a non-profit as an 8 TV driver.

4707
03:44:16,480 --> 03:44:18,240
But that's not how he is now, right?

4708
03:44:18,360 --> 03:44:20,000
We didn't just get spoiled, did we?

4709
03:44:22,220 --> 03:44:26,000
Jesse has 740 images spread over 210 animations.

4710
03:44:26,000 --> 03:44:29,900
There are more than 3000 images for the animation of all characters.

4711
03:44:31,200 --> 03:44:33,360
The Unmetal logo evolved over time.

4712
03:44:33,580 --> 03:44:37,300
At first, we had a metallic logo that was inspired by 80s military movies.

4713
03:44:39,560 --> 03:44:43,760
For the public demo, we changed the title to a more minimalistic version.

4714
03:44:44,880 --> 03:44:46,660
In the end, I felt something was missing.

4715
03:44:46,780 --> 03:44:48,420
We tried a chromed version of the letters.

4716
03:44:48,580 --> 03:44:50,240
This would be the definitive version.

4717
03:44:51,720 --> 03:44:52,240
Wow!

4718
03:44:52,900 --> 03:44:55,980
When releasing a game, some artwork couldn't be good for marketing.

4719
03:44:56,000 --> 03:44:58,320
Here's a mock-up of Jesse preparing to fight a tank.

4720
03:44:59,580 --> 03:45:00,020
Yeah!

4721
03:45:00,260 --> 03:45:03,940
It looks just like that one snake figure.

4722
03:45:08,120 --> 03:45:11,660
This is a version that features a closer view of Jesse Fox against the tank.

4723
03:45:11,740 --> 03:45:13,680
He's going to need a bigger weapon than a pistol.

4724
03:45:15,480 --> 03:45:17,700
Here's another image of Jesse fighting a nuclear...

4725
03:45:17,700 --> 03:45:18,960
These would have been great for thumbnails.

4726
03:45:20,180 --> 03:45:21,540
Pretty sure you find it familiar.

4727
03:45:22,400 --> 03:45:23,480
Oh, the nuclear sub.

4728
03:45:23,600 --> 03:45:24,560
By the way, good job.

4729
03:45:24,560 --> 03:45:24,920
Thanks!

4730
03:45:27,000 --> 03:45:29,400
A lot of the publisher team enjoyed the cat joke.

4731
03:45:29,640 --> 03:45:31,260
The artist seemed to like it too.

4732
03:45:31,320 --> 03:45:32,960
We made this mock-up inspired by it.

4733
03:45:33,640 --> 03:45:35,560
Oh, the shadow is a cat.

4734
03:45:35,740 --> 03:45:36,440
That's so cute.

4735
03:45:38,600 --> 03:45:41,720
This mock-up was a first attempt for an un-metal cover image.

4736
03:45:43,200 --> 03:45:44,580
Then there was another attempt.

4737
03:45:46,160 --> 03:45:47,760
That we actually preferred.

4738
03:45:47,980 --> 03:45:48,700
So we chose it.

4739
03:45:48,800 --> 03:45:49,140
It is...

4740
03:45:49,940 --> 03:45:50,420
It...

4741
03:45:50,420 --> 03:45:51,860
We chose it and it...

4742
03:45:51,860 --> 03:45:53,900
The artist made a full HD poster.

4743
03:45:54,560 --> 03:45:56,160
This would later be un-metal's official cover.

4744
03:45:57,880 --> 03:45:58,360
Bob.

4745
03:45:58,520 --> 03:45:59,860
Bob, seek help, please.

4746
03:46:00,200 --> 03:46:02,040
Before those mock-ups, there were earlier covers.

4747
03:46:02,160 --> 03:46:04,860
This is the original one from Marcel, un-metal's graphic artist.

4748
03:46:05,860 --> 03:46:06,340
Whoa!

4749
03:46:07,040 --> 03:46:09,280
This is a more photorealistic version from Patrick.

4750
03:46:09,820 --> 03:46:11,520
A former mate in Ubisoft.

4751
03:46:11,540 --> 03:46:12,540
Holy moly.

4752
03:46:14,500 --> 03:46:18,340
Last but not least, the cover created by Carol for un-metal.

4753
03:46:20,040 --> 03:46:22,900
We used for the box art and the PlayStation Vita.

4754
03:46:28,420 --> 03:46:35,780
Even Enrique Carmina, the actor who gives voice to the Spanish version of Jesse, did his own design.

4755
03:46:39,560 --> 03:46:41,780
After the Vita release, we improved some parts.

4756
03:46:41,840 --> 03:46:45,040
For example, we added vapors, water movement, garbage, and other details.

4757
03:46:45,340 --> 03:46:45,560
Yeah!

4758
03:46:46,900 --> 03:46:49,300
We animated trees in the jungle.

4759
03:46:49,340 --> 03:46:51,620
Updated bullet visuals from white dots.

4760
03:46:52,800 --> 03:46:54,920
And finally, we improved the water from the river.

4761
03:46:55,380 --> 03:46:55,820
Oh...

4762
03:46:57,160 --> 03:46:57,600
Ah!

4763
03:46:57,880 --> 03:46:58,160
Oh!

4764
03:46:58,460 --> 03:46:59,720
This looks like a spoiler.

4765
03:46:59,900 --> 03:47:00,400
That's all.

4766
03:47:00,560 --> 03:47:01,280
I hope you found it interesting.

4767
03:47:01,460 --> 03:47:02,220
Thanks for playing my game.

4768
03:47:02,340 --> 03:47:03,500
And good luck with the final boss fight.

4769
03:47:03,580 --> 03:47:04,160
Oh, thank you!

4770
03:47:07,240 --> 03:47:07,680
Thanks!

4771
03:47:11,060 --> 03:47:11,500
Oh!

4772
03:47:12,100 --> 03:47:12,540
Fuck!

4773
03:47:12,640 --> 03:47:17,620
I found out that bastard kept a fully stocked armory behind his office.

4774
03:47:17,660 --> 03:47:18,840
That sounds good.

4775
03:47:19,640 --> 03:47:25,800
I feel like I'm gonna need this for a final bo- for what could be a final box fight.

4776
03:47:25,860 --> 03:47:26,540
I'm just saying.

4777
03:47:30,160 --> 03:47:30,920
You know?

4778
03:47:31,300 --> 03:47:32,480
I'm just saying.

4779
03:47:32,780 --> 03:47:34,400
Could be great to have.

4780
03:47:39,380 --> 03:47:39,940
Oh...

4781
03:47:39,940 --> 03:47:42,560
Oh my goodness.

4782
03:47:44,460 --> 03:47:45,320
Hell yeah.

4783
03:47:46,280 --> 03:47:48,000
Lots and lots of bullets left though.

4784
03:47:50,300 --> 03:47:50,860
Okay.

4785
03:47:51,680 --> 03:47:52,240
Cool!

4786
03:47:54,380 --> 03:47:55,320
Colonel, you good?

4787
03:48:01,250 --> 03:48:01,590
Okay.

4788
03:48:02,390 --> 03:48:02,890
All right.

4789
03:48:02,930 --> 03:48:04,090
Final boss fight, maybe?

4790
03:48:04,830 --> 03:48:06,170
You picked up more than two rockets.

4791
03:48:06,250 --> 03:48:07,510
Yeah, because I got an upgrade earlier.

4792
03:48:08,890 --> 03:48:11,910
I got an upgrade that allowed me- I wish I could have upgraded to level 10.

4793
03:48:13,590 --> 03:48:13,930
Oh.

4794
03:48:14,830 --> 03:48:15,170
Sorry.

4795
03:48:16,070 --> 03:48:17,710
I think I need to have him to go.

4796
03:48:18,690 --> 03:48:19,290
Wait a second.

4797
03:48:19,410 --> 03:48:19,550
Oh!

4798
03:48:19,590 --> 03:48:20,610
No, no, no, no, no.

4799
03:48:20,650 --> 03:48:21,170
My bad.

4800
03:48:21,730 --> 03:48:22,270
Here we go.

4801
03:48:23,790 --> 03:48:25,010
I wanted- No!

4802
03:48:25,410 --> 03:48:29,220
I- I'm trying to punch it.

4803
03:48:29,840 --> 03:48:30,180
Oh!

4804
03:48:30,180 --> 03:48:31,160
Oh!

4805
03:48:31,160 --> 03:48:32,320
But I guess it doesn't matter.

4806
03:48:32,480 --> 03:48:32,700
Okay.

4807
03:48:34,660 --> 03:48:37,160
I should heal all the way.

4808
03:48:38,540 --> 03:48:40,100
10 is max if you were wondering.

4809
03:48:40,220 --> 03:48:41,240
I figured it would be.

4810
03:48:41,700 --> 03:48:44,020
I should probably finish healing though, shouldn't I?

4811
03:48:46,000 --> 03:48:47,460
Before I go down there.

4812
03:48:48,640 --> 03:48:49,320
You know?

4813
03:48:53,200 --> 03:48:55,560
I'm healing really slowly though.

4814
03:48:55,560 --> 03:48:59,940
So... I'm healing sooo slow!

4815
03:49:02,060 --> 03:49:04,000
I wonder what the final perks were.

4816
03:49:07,700 --> 03:49:09,500
Fight the potted plant.

4817
03:49:09,860 --> 03:49:10,620
This one.

4818
03:49:24,520 --> 03:49:26,340
We're so close to being...

4819
03:49:28,120 --> 03:49:28,860
Full health.

4820
03:49:29,040 --> 03:49:32,040
Like so... Just a little bit more.

4821
03:49:33,020 --> 03:49:33,740
Punch the music?

4822
03:49:33,820 --> 03:49:34,120
I tried.

4823
03:49:34,360 --> 03:49:34,920
It doesn't work.

4824
03:49:34,960 --> 03:49:35,420
It doesn't do anything.

4825
03:49:38,040 --> 03:49:38,480
Okay.

4826
03:49:38,940 --> 03:49:39,360
Here we go.

4827
03:49:39,560 --> 03:49:40,900
I do still have God Mode!

4828
03:49:41,780 --> 03:49:42,780
What does that do again?

4829
03:49:44,580 --> 03:49:46,340
Grants limited invulnerability.

4830
03:49:51,920 --> 03:49:53,060
Come on, Colonel!

4831
03:49:57,760 --> 03:49:58,360
Okay.

4832
03:49:58,360 --> 03:49:59,380
Here we go.

4833
03:50:08,620 --> 03:50:09,820
Jesse here.

4834
03:50:10,080 --> 03:50:10,840
Do you copy?

4835
03:50:11,240 --> 03:50:11,960
I hear you.

4836
03:50:12,280 --> 03:50:20,610
Oh, there's more!

4837
03:50:23,490 --> 03:50:24,410
I hear you.

4838
03:50:24,450 --> 03:50:26,530
I finally reached the last floor.

4839
03:50:27,850 --> 03:50:28,770
Oh my god.

4840
03:50:28,770 --> 03:50:31,210
Lieutenant, we already have the ballistics results.

4841
03:50:31,310 --> 03:50:31,670
Oh, fast!

4842
03:50:31,930 --> 03:50:32,090
And?

4843
03:50:32,390 --> 03:50:33,430
You are right, sir.

4844
03:50:33,890 --> 03:50:37,630
Ballistics established that the bullet was fired from Mr. Fox's gun.

4845
03:50:37,890 --> 03:50:39,410
You killed Colonel Harris!

4846
03:50:39,490 --> 03:50:39,730
No!

4847
03:50:39,770 --> 03:50:40,350
You bastard!

4848
03:50:40,530 --> 03:50:40,950
Oh my god.

4849
03:50:41,010 --> 03:50:41,870
Sergeant, behave.

4850
03:50:42,330 --> 03:50:44,870
Sir, permission to execute that assassin!

4851
03:50:45,050 --> 03:50:45,370
No!

4852
03:50:45,470 --> 03:50:46,050
Permission denied.

4853
03:50:46,270 --> 03:50:50,370
First off, we can't confirm the identity of the victim until we have the forensics report.

4854
03:50:51,150 --> 03:50:51,630
You killed Kenny!

4855
03:50:51,630 --> 03:50:54,810
Second, according to policy, Mr. Fox has the right to finish his story.

4856
03:50:55,050 --> 03:50:55,750
You bastard!

4857
03:50:55,950 --> 03:50:57,330
Mr. Fox, continue.

4858
03:50:57,330 --> 03:50:57,530
Continue?

4859
03:50:57,750 --> 03:51:00,130
You better not contradict the evidence we're collecting.

4860
03:51:00,330 --> 03:51:00,470
No!

4861
03:51:03,590 --> 03:51:05,030
What are you trying to say, huh?

4862
03:51:05,290 --> 03:51:06,670
What are you trying to say, huh?

4863
03:51:06,950 --> 03:51:07,730
Okay, save.

4864
03:51:08,310 --> 03:51:11,290
Mr. Fox, leaving so soon.

4865
03:51:11,450 --> 03:51:12,730
Mr. Hound.

4866
03:51:13,270 --> 03:51:15,450
That's not very neighborly of you.

4867
03:51:15,650 --> 03:51:17,330
And what's that on your shoulder?

4868
03:51:17,570 --> 03:51:20,110
That's personal property, Mr. Fox.

4869
03:51:20,430 --> 03:51:22,850
Haven't your parents taught you never to steal?

4870
03:51:23,110 --> 03:51:23,570
Steal?

4871
03:51:23,670 --> 03:51:25,590
General X stood in my way.

4872
03:51:25,830 --> 03:51:26,290
Oh gosh.

4873
03:51:26,290 --> 03:51:29,590
Assuming it was really him, and not another hologram.

4874
03:51:29,810 --> 03:51:30,230
Okay.

4875
03:51:30,510 --> 03:51:33,050
Are you asking yourself if I'm another hologram?

4876
03:51:33,050 --> 03:51:34,230
I hate this guy!

4877
03:51:34,510 --> 03:51:34,790
Yeah?

4878
03:51:34,850 --> 03:51:35,850
I hate this guy!

4879
03:51:36,230 --> 03:51:38,130
No, not this guy.

4880
03:51:38,310 --> 03:51:38,850
Oh, okay.

4881
03:51:38,850 --> 03:51:40,390
It is I, in the flesh.

4882
03:51:40,430 --> 03:51:42,710
Why were you projecting from before?

4883
03:51:43,090 --> 03:51:44,510
Now, put a bullet in my head.

4884
03:51:44,610 --> 03:51:45,070
Yeah.

4885
03:51:45,330 --> 03:51:46,110
You read my mind.

4886
03:51:46,430 --> 03:51:47,930
Please tell me, Mr. Fox.

4887
03:51:48,150 --> 03:51:48,430
Oh.

4888
03:51:48,510 --> 03:51:51,010
How does one shoot that which they cannot see?

4889
03:51:51,410 --> 03:51:51,930
What?

4890
03:51:51,990 --> 03:51:52,310
What?

4891
03:51:54,450 --> 03:51:56,830
Do you like my new device, Mr. Fox?

4892
03:51:56,830 --> 03:51:57,150
No!

4893
03:51:57,650 --> 03:51:58,910
Well, do you like my sunglasses?

4894
03:51:59,590 --> 03:52:00,350
Optical electronic holo-camouflage.

4895
03:52:00,450 --> 03:52:01,930
The latest in nanotechnology.

4896
03:52:02,390 --> 03:52:03,290
Not the nanotechnology.

4897
03:52:03,970 --> 03:52:07,230
Obviously, if you start firing randomly, there's still a chance I may be hit.

4898
03:52:07,390 --> 03:52:08,090
All right.

4899
03:52:08,390 --> 03:52:10,630
I believe dumb luck is a concept you're fond of?

4900
03:52:10,710 --> 03:52:11,490
Self-camel.

4901
03:52:11,490 --> 03:52:15,930
So, if you don't mind, I invite you to spend some ammunition with some friends.

4902
03:52:16,170 --> 03:52:16,410
No!

4903
03:52:16,710 --> 03:52:17,790
General X!

4904
03:52:20,330 --> 03:52:21,350
Oh, wait.

4905
03:52:21,950 --> 03:52:22,570
Rusty Wire.

4906
03:52:22,830 --> 03:52:24,350
What did I do that with?

4907
03:52:24,810 --> 03:52:25,650
Okay, select.

4908
03:52:27,470 --> 03:52:27,950
Aah!

4909
03:52:31,060 --> 03:52:32,800
Wait, how did I destroy this thing before?

4910
03:52:33,600 --> 03:52:34,080
Ouch!

4911
03:52:36,740 --> 03:52:37,220
Wait.

4912
03:52:37,460 --> 03:52:38,360
What about my gun?

4913
03:52:42,270 --> 03:52:43,370
What happened to my...

4914
03:52:43,370 --> 03:52:44,090
Where did he go?

4915
03:52:50,320 --> 03:52:51,640
He's taking my stuff.

4916
03:52:52,640 --> 03:52:55,020
Okay, I don't think the sunglasses does anything.

4917
03:52:57,780 --> 03:52:59,960
I don't think the sunglasses does anything.

4918
03:53:00,240 --> 03:53:05,160
I don't think the sunglasses does anything, so we probably need to just heal.

4919
03:53:26,000 --> 03:53:27,340
Where is he?

4920
03:53:27,760 --> 03:53:30,520
Oh my god, that was so... I was gaming?

4921
03:53:30,820 --> 03:53:31,220
For real?

4922
03:53:31,220 --> 03:53:37,300
Oh gosh, I... He stole my... Oh, he stole my ring.

4923
03:53:37,700 --> 03:53:40,720
Oh my

4924
03:53:46,120 --> 03:53:46,920
gosh, where is he?

4925
03:53:48,840 --> 03:53:49,540
Oh, there he is.

4926
03:53:53,600 --> 03:53:54,000
Wait,

4927
03:53:58,560 --> 03:53:59,200
what are you talking about?

4928
03:53:59,240 --> 03:53:59,800
Oh my gosh.

4929
03:53:59,840 --> 03:54:00,920
Oh, I do have grenades.

4930
03:54:02,100 --> 03:54:03,340
I don't want to use them.

4931
03:54:09,810 --> 03:54:10,490
What the hell is this?

4932
03:54:11,650 --> 03:54:12,190
Oh my god.

4933
03:54:12,970 --> 03:54:13,730
Ouchie, ouch, ouch, ouch.

4934
03:54:16,630 --> 03:54:17,550
I'm going to bleed out.

4935
03:54:17,610 --> 03:54:18,290
I'm going to bleed out.

4936
03:54:18,330 --> 03:54:18,790
I'm going to bleed out.

4937
03:54:28,970 --> 03:54:30,190
It's the real Metal Gear.

4938
03:54:35,390 --> 03:54:37,330
Okay, I kind of get the fight though.

4939
03:54:39,810 --> 03:54:41,190
Maybe I should just use this immediately.

4940
03:54:41,610 --> 03:54:43,790
But like, also I feel like it's kind of a waste, right?

4941
03:54:43,990 --> 03:54:45,050
He's going to steal it.

4942
03:54:48,710 --> 03:54:50,210
My EMP nades.

4943
03:54:52,450 --> 03:54:53,210
These ones?

4944
03:54:53,410 --> 03:54:54,190
But for what?

4945
03:54:57,430 --> 03:54:59,110
For... for... for what?

4946
03:55:05,740 --> 03:55:06,900
For his cloak?

4947
03:55:07,140 --> 03:55:09,860
But I would have to... I would have to...

4948
03:55:11,020 --> 03:55:14,840
Make sure it's... it's... um...

4949
03:55:15,240 --> 03:55:16,620
He's in the spot though.

4950
03:55:20,980 --> 03:55:24,320
Okay, Alexi, you don't have to be an asshole about it.

4951
03:55:24,360 --> 03:55:24,580
Gosh.

4952
03:55:25,360 --> 03:55:27,760
It's just that I would have to know where to aim it.

4953
03:55:27,940 --> 03:55:28,920
And that's the issue.

4954
03:55:32,080 --> 03:55:34,280
Gosh, you don't have to be a smartass about it.

4955
03:55:34,580 --> 03:55:34,980
Gosh.

4956
03:55:36,800 --> 03:55:37,200
Gosh.

4957
03:55:46,760 --> 03:55:48,860
What if I just fight normally?

4958
03:55:49,100 --> 03:55:51,240
How... I have it.

4959
03:55:51,400 --> 03:55:51,920
As...

4960
03:55:53,240 --> 03:55:53,960
I'll try.

4961
03:55:54,260 --> 03:55:54,880
I'll try.

4962
03:55:55,260 --> 03:55:56,260
I guess I'll try.

4963
03:55:56,700 --> 03:55:57,380
I guess it doesn't...

4964
03:55:58,760 --> 03:56:01,560
I guess it doesn't hurt, but...

4965
03:56:03,200 --> 03:56:04,200
Oh my gosh.

4966
03:56:04,240 --> 03:56:05,640
Oh, that was me dropping the guy.

4967
03:56:05,720 --> 03:56:06,260
I just realized.

4968
03:56:07,700 --> 03:56:10,840
Wait, how can I... Oh, if I combine it with the ring, right?

4969
03:56:13,680 --> 03:56:15,340
Okay, and then if I...

4970
03:56:16,160 --> 03:56:17,800
Oh, I already have it.

4971
03:56:18,700 --> 03:56:19,100
Okay.

4972
03:56:20,600 --> 03:56:21,080
So...

4973
03:56:21,080 --> 03:56:21,680
Hyah!

4974
03:56:21,760 --> 03:56:22,520
Oh, hyah!

4975
03:56:23,660 --> 03:56:24,140
Hyah!

4976
03:56:26,440 --> 03:56:26,920
Hyah!

4977
03:56:29,120 --> 03:56:29,600
Hyah!

4978
03:56:29,600 --> 03:56:29,760
Hyah!

4979
03:56:32,420 --> 03:56:32,900
Hyah!

4980
03:56:34,280 --> 03:56:39,100
I think I was playing it correctly before, but you guys want me to play like this, so...

4981
03:56:40,320 --> 03:56:40,800
Hyah!

4982
03:56:42,740 --> 03:56:43,220
Hyah!

4983
03:56:44,560 --> 03:56:45,040
Hyah!

4984
03:56:46,180 --> 03:56:47,860
Did I... did I do well?

4985
03:56:50,280 --> 03:56:52,420
Oh, but this is how you guys wanted me to play it.

4986
03:56:53,240 --> 03:56:53,840
Are you sure?

4987
03:56:54,660 --> 03:56:55,400
Oh, my bad.

4988
03:56:58,280 --> 03:57:02,560
This is how you guys wanted me to play the game, so I'm just doing what you guys asked me to do.

4989
03:57:06,100 --> 03:57:06,820
Chat was wrong?

4990
03:57:07,640 --> 03:57:11,120
No, it's definitely like a skill issue probably kind of thing, right?

4991
03:57:13,960 --> 03:57:15,220
What if I like...

4992
03:57:16,620 --> 03:57:17,400
Can I use this?

4993
03:57:19,440 --> 03:57:20,620
No, I just get hit.

4994
03:57:29,500 --> 03:57:29,940
Anyway...

4995
03:57:31,700 --> 03:57:33,520
I didn't ask you to get a hit, soldier.

4996
03:57:33,960 --> 03:57:34,400
Perfect.

4997
03:57:34,600 --> 03:57:35,800
That's why you're the boss.

4998
03:57:37,960 --> 03:57:38,400
Okay.

4999
03:57:40,940 --> 03:57:41,800
Alright, anyway.

5000
03:57:42,260 --> 03:57:43,960
I'm gonna shoot the drones instead.

5001
03:57:44,340 --> 03:57:46,040
And just let him...

5002
03:57:48,220 --> 03:57:49,680
Just let him take my stuff.

5003
03:57:49,920 --> 03:57:50,240
Oh, shoot.

5004
03:57:51,820 --> 03:57:52,180
Ow!

5005
03:57:52,540 --> 03:57:56,440
I pressed the wrong... button, you guys.

5006
03:57:56,660 --> 03:57:57,000
For real.

5007
03:57:59,380 --> 03:57:59,920
Oh, shoot.

5008
03:58:00,660 --> 03:58:02,740
My... I thought my hands were in a different placement.

5009
03:58:10,220 --> 03:58:11,240
Oh, I thought I was...

5010
03:58:11,800 --> 03:58:12,360
There we go.

5011
03:58:19,690 --> 03:58:20,050
Ouchie.

5012
03:58:20,050 --> 03:58:20,670
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

5013
03:58:20,690 --> 03:58:21,850
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

5014
03:58:26,020 --> 03:58:26,380
Good.

5015
03:58:26,520 --> 03:58:26,720
Oh.

5016
03:58:28,620 --> 03:58:29,400
Oh, my gosh.

5017
03:58:29,680 --> 03:58:30,500
This is not good.

5018
03:58:31,360 --> 03:58:31,960
Okay, though.

5019
03:58:36,260 --> 03:58:38,100
Do you have many bullets left?

5020
03:58:38,480 --> 03:58:40,780
I don't know.

5021
03:58:40,780 --> 03:58:41,600
I don't think so.

5022
03:58:41,680 --> 03:58:42,840
I suspect you stashed some grenades there.

5023
03:58:42,880 --> 03:58:44,180
He took my potty!

5024
03:58:46,200 --> 03:58:46,920
Oh, gosh.

5025
03:58:46,980 --> 03:58:50,060
This is... This is where I'm kind of probably in real trouble.

5026
03:58:56,300 --> 03:58:56,780
Yeah!

5027
03:58:58,440 --> 03:58:59,240
Oh, my gosh.

5028
03:59:01,060 --> 03:59:01,500
Oh!

5029
03:59:03,020 --> 03:59:07,120
I... I was... I was pressing... I was pressing roll, but it was the cooldown.

5030
03:59:07,520 --> 03:59:08,200
It was the cooldown.

5031
03:59:09,660 --> 03:59:11,100
The blood bag!

5032
03:59:12,220 --> 03:59:12,900
You're right.

5033
03:59:12,940 --> 03:59:13,780
I do have that.

5034
03:59:15,740 --> 03:59:16,640
Mr. Fox.

5035
03:59:25,470 --> 03:59:25,910
No!

5036
03:59:26,030 --> 03:59:26,630
My potty!

5037
03:59:39,400 --> 03:59:41,060
I'm trying to get to them before they...

5038
03:59:41,060 --> 03:59:42,820
Before they start shooting at me.

5039
03:59:57,680 --> 04:00:00,380
Do you have many bullets left, Fox?

5040
04:00:00,380 --> 04:00:00,940
Oh, yeah.

5041
04:00:00,940 --> 04:00:02,080
I imagine not.

5042
04:00:02,120 --> 04:00:02,520
Oh, yeah.

5043
04:00:02,520 --> 04:00:05,640
Still fill all the potty so he can steal a full one.

5044
04:00:08,460 --> 04:00:10,040
That sounds awful.

5045
04:00:10,500 --> 04:00:11,600
I'll try it.

5046
04:00:14,600 --> 04:00:16,080
I don't think it works.

5047
04:00:20,700 --> 04:00:21,980
Oh, gosh.

5048
04:00:23,160 --> 04:00:25,880
It just doesn't really help when...

5049
04:00:26,920 --> 04:00:27,720
Oh, my gosh.

5050
04:00:27,800 --> 04:00:29,360
When I get hit every time.

5051
04:00:31,640 --> 04:00:33,200
Oh, I don't know how to... Wait.

5052
04:00:33,240 --> 04:00:34,700
I don't know how to avoid these, actually.

5053
04:00:35,440 --> 04:00:35,880
Wait.

5054
04:00:35,940 --> 04:00:37,320
I don't know how to avoid them at all.

5055
04:00:39,880 --> 04:00:41,060
I am rolling.

5056
04:00:41,160 --> 04:00:41,860
I am rolling.

5057
04:00:50,610 --> 04:00:52,110
Roll to the opposite of the gun.

5058
04:00:52,210 --> 04:00:52,450
Okay.

5059
04:00:54,010 --> 04:00:57,370
So, like, he starts blasting and I go...

5060
04:00:58,730 --> 04:01:00,150
I think I should stick with the grenades.

5061
04:01:00,290 --> 04:01:00,790
I'll be honest.

5062
04:01:01,070 --> 04:01:01,730
Oh, uh...

5063
04:01:02,990 --> 04:01:03,450
Oh,

5064
04:01:08,290 --> 04:01:09,430
shit, shit, shit!

5065
04:01:10,010 --> 04:01:10,890
Oh, my God.

5066
04:01:12,810 --> 04:01:14,170
Oh, I can't.

5067
04:01:14,170 --> 04:01:14,860
I can't, like...

5068
04:01:17,330 --> 04:01:18,430
I'm gonna die here.

5069
04:01:18,510 --> 04:01:18,950
I'm gonna die.

5070
04:01:23,730 --> 04:01:24,350
Actually, yeah.

5071
04:01:29,830 --> 04:01:30,670
Oh, shit.

5072
04:01:31,690 --> 04:01:32,610
I'm gonna die.

5073
04:01:32,770 --> 04:01:33,730
I'm not gonna make it.

5074
04:01:34,970 --> 04:01:37,870
I... I think I just blew up on my own.

5075
04:01:38,750 --> 04:01:39,310
Grenade!

5076
04:01:39,410 --> 04:01:40,510
Are you kidding me?

5077
04:01:43,110 --> 04:01:43,670
No!

5078
04:01:45,410 --> 04:01:47,170
I... I was in the direction.

5079
04:01:50,530 --> 04:01:52,090
That's so messed up.

5080
04:01:52,090 --> 04:01:52,730
But...

5081
04:01:58,330 --> 04:01:59,170
Come on!

5082
04:02:23,820 --> 04:02:24,780
Just kill me.

5083
04:02:24,900 --> 04:02:26,240
I don't wanna... This isn't the run.

5084
04:02:26,800 --> 04:02:27,680
No, just kill me.

5085
04:02:27,720 --> 04:02:28,120
Just kill me.

5086
04:02:28,140 --> 04:02:28,640
Just kill me.

5087
04:02:28,940 --> 04:02:29,900
Just kill me.

5088
04:02:29,920 --> 04:02:30,460
Just kill me.

5089
04:02:30,520 --> 04:02:31,180
Just kill me.

5090
04:02:36,340 --> 04:02:38,160
EMP does work on un-metal gear?

5091
04:02:38,560 --> 04:02:41,500
But it didn't do anything when I tried it.

5092
04:02:43,200 --> 04:02:45,020
But it didn't do anything when I tried it.

5093
04:02:45,240 --> 04:02:45,280
But it didn't do anything when I tried it.

5094
04:02:46,380 --> 04:02:47,200
After that.

5095
04:02:48,400 --> 04:02:49,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5096
04:02:53,220 --> 04:02:54,400
Did I do it too early?

5097
04:02:54,600 --> 04:02:55,020
Oh.

5098
04:02:55,260 --> 04:02:56,720
I don't know.

5099
04:02:56,900 --> 04:02:57,480
Did I?

5100
04:03:00,730 --> 04:03:02,010
You son of a bitch.

5101
04:03:05,330 --> 04:03:09,470
Not my hanky!

5102
04:03:09,490 --> 04:03:10,990
It has all my mucus in it!

5103
04:03:10,990 --> 04:03:11,070
No!

5104
04:03:15,230 --> 04:03:16,150
You... jerk!

5105
04:03:16,410 --> 04:03:17,170
Oh, shoot.

5106
04:03:18,290 --> 04:03:20,490
Well, actually, I wish I could shoot!

5107
04:03:27,980 --> 04:03:31,240
I'm not trying to have, like, a perfect run, but I think it helps.

5108
04:03:36,040 --> 04:03:36,960
Okay, so...

5109
04:03:38,160 --> 04:03:39,660
If I use it...

5110
04:03:47,760 --> 04:03:49,280
I don't think punching is very good.

5111
04:03:50,560 --> 04:03:51,920
It does work on it.

5112
04:03:52,440 --> 04:03:53,040
Okay.

5113
04:03:57,020 --> 04:04:04,120
You can easily destroy a robot if you use invisible by combining ring and pyramid, but need luck to not get stolen.

5114
04:04:04,500 --> 04:04:06,880
Yeah, it gets stolen very quickly.

5115
04:04:09,300 --> 04:04:09,900
So...

5116
04:04:09,900 --> 04:04:12,380
I think he just goes in order down the line.

5117
04:04:23,570 --> 04:04:24,970
It didn't even...

5118
04:04:25,850 --> 04:04:27,990
It didn't even... I'm like...

5119
04:04:27,990 --> 04:04:29,650
I'm just gonna die.

5120
04:04:29,650 --> 04:04:30,270
I'm just gonna die here.

5121
04:04:30,270 --> 04:04:31,030
I'm just gonna die here.

5122
04:04:38,410 --> 04:04:49,150
I honestly don't even think I should use it because I am not skilled enough to use it and then go switch to the grenade and use it and not fuck it up.

5123
04:04:54,460 --> 04:04:55,880
I think is the...

5124
04:04:57,680 --> 04:04:59,360
Is the issue here.

5125
04:04:59,360 --> 04:04:59,460
I think is the issue here.

5126
04:05:03,320 --> 04:05:04,760
Mr. Fox!

5127
04:05:10,440 --> 04:05:14,810
Stop taking my...

5128
04:05:14,810 --> 04:05:17,790
Stop taking my...

5129
04:05:17,790 --> 04:05:18,430
Stop taking my...

5130
04:05:18,430 --> 04:05:20,530
You're such a little freak, you know that?

5131
04:05:22,690 --> 04:05:23,810
Oh my god.

5132
04:05:34,610 --> 04:05:35,950
I hate...

5133
04:05:35,950 --> 04:05:36,870
I hate...

5134
04:05:36,870 --> 04:05:37,450
I hate...

5135
04:05:37,450 --> 04:05:37,450
everything.

5136
04:05:37,890 --> 04:05:39,030
I hate everything.

5137
04:05:39,330 --> 04:05:40,130
I hate everything.

5138
04:05:45,620 --> 04:05:49,660
I have to be... I would have to be like so fast for him to not steal it.

5139
04:05:52,180 --> 04:05:58,100
No, I would have to be so fast for him to like not steal.

5140
04:05:58,540 --> 04:06:03,220
Oh, so he took the ring but he didn't take the invulnerability!

5141
04:06:03,500 --> 04:06:04,720
You... ahhh!

5142
04:06:05,200 --> 04:06:07,100
Okay, so it is random what he takes.

5143
04:06:07,760 --> 04:06:08,660
Okay, interesting.

5144
04:06:11,320 --> 04:06:11,760
Rockets?

5145
04:06:11,820 --> 04:06:13,760
Oh, okay, just so you guys shut up, please.

5146
04:06:26,720 --> 04:06:29,960
Oh my god, it worked!

5147
04:06:30,180 --> 04:06:31,260
I'm about to die.

5148
04:06:31,400 --> 04:06:31,920
Hold on.

5149
04:06:36,140 --> 04:06:38,640
Well, you should be low on ammo by now.

5150
04:06:38,660 --> 04:06:42,040
Which means it's time to comfortably finish you.

5151
04:06:42,200 --> 04:06:45,080
By the way, I'm sure you may have noticed by now...

5152
04:06:45,080 --> 04:06:45,100
What the hell?

5153
04:06:45,100 --> 04:06:45,460
How did that work?

5154
04:06:45,600 --> 04:06:47,480
Okay, chat was right about something.

5155
04:06:47,720 --> 04:06:52,560
I took the liberty to follow you around and recover some of my stolen property.

5156
04:06:54,240 --> 04:06:55,720
Oh, now it's him!

5157
04:06:56,520 --> 04:06:58,420
Oh, now it's him!

5158
04:07:14,880 --> 04:07:16,500
Oh, I have no...

5159
04:07:24,520 --> 04:07:28,080
Guys, the night goggles are... maybe the sunglasses for real?

5160
04:07:29,420 --> 04:07:32,040
Okay, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

5161
04:07:35,500 --> 04:07:37,200
I have to EMP him?

5162
04:07:37,420 --> 04:07:37,820
I do?

5163
04:07:39,040 --> 04:07:39,820
Oh, shit.

5164
04:07:40,600 --> 04:07:41,500
What the hell?

5165
04:07:41,920 --> 04:07:44,560
Even when I shoot at him, it doesn't...

5166
04:07:46,440 --> 04:07:47,360
Oh, shit!

5167
04:07:50,560 --> 04:07:52,180
I have to EMP him for real?

5168
04:08:07,240 --> 04:08:09,840
Oh, it lasts two seconds!

5169
04:08:10,320 --> 04:08:11,440
Are you kidding me?

5170
04:08:12,340 --> 04:08:15,380
It lasts literally no time at all!

5171
04:08:17,400 --> 04:08:18,860
He took my bandages.

5172
04:08:20,920 --> 04:08:22,800
This guy took my bandages.

5173
04:08:22,820 --> 04:08:23,860
I have nothing to heal.

5174
04:08:24,900 --> 04:08:26,200
I have nothing to heal.

5175
04:08:29,380 --> 04:08:30,500
That is...

5176
04:08:30,500 --> 04:08:34,440
That is so narrow of a window, it's actually unfair.

5177
04:08:38,380 --> 04:08:39,380
Oh, my gosh.

5178
04:08:39,500 --> 04:08:40,200
No way.

5179
04:08:40,420 --> 04:08:40,780
I...

5180
04:08:40,780 --> 04:08:41,880
There's...

5181
04:08:41,880 --> 04:08:42,460
Huh?

5182
04:08:43,900 --> 04:08:45,480
Oh, I think I accidentally pressed...

5183
04:08:47,160 --> 04:08:49,540
Maybe I can... do that.

5184
04:08:54,460 --> 04:08:55,480
Oh, whoops.

5185
04:08:55,840 --> 04:08:56,440
Okay.

5186
04:08:56,540 --> 04:08:58,320
Oh, that's it.

5187
04:08:58,420 --> 04:08:59,420
And we're done.

5188
04:09:01,200 --> 04:09:02,200
And we're done.

5189
04:09:08,830 --> 04:09:10,350
Maybe if I...

5190
04:09:17,740 --> 04:09:19,480
I can't even punch him.

5191
04:09:21,300 --> 04:09:22,880
How did he get over here?

5192
04:09:24,900 --> 04:09:26,340
How did you get over here?

5193
04:09:32,260 --> 04:09:32,820
How?

5194
04:09:44,510 --> 04:09:45,910
Punching does do stuff.

5195
04:09:46,290 --> 04:09:48,630
It's just I have to be able to get there.

5196
04:09:48,930 --> 04:09:50,350
Oh, this is so annoying.

5197
04:09:55,690 --> 04:09:56,410
Oh, wait.

5198
04:09:56,470 --> 04:09:56,770
Hold on.

5199
04:09:56,770 --> 04:09:57,030
Hold on.

5200
04:09:57,050 --> 04:09:57,470
I wasn't ready.

5201
04:09:57,590 --> 04:09:57,950
Hold on.

5202
04:09:58,010 --> 04:09:58,510
I wasn't ready.

5203
04:09:59,390 --> 04:10:00,250
Oh, gosh.

5204
04:10:00,570 --> 04:10:00,890
Okay.

5205
04:10:01,030 --> 04:10:01,490
Hold on.

5206
04:10:02,030 --> 04:10:04,110
I'm getting... I'm getting really...

5207
04:10:12,220 --> 04:10:12,640
Sorry.

5208
04:10:12,800 --> 04:10:14,080
It's just 1 p.m.

5209
04:10:14,080 --> 04:10:15,020
and I haven't eaten anything.

5210
04:10:31,520 --> 04:10:33,500
Let me just eat some of these sticks.

5211
04:10:43,610 --> 04:10:46,850
I also thought I would be done by like... I need to leave at 2.

5212
04:10:48,750 --> 04:10:50,870
So, I thought I would be done way earlier than that.

5213
04:10:53,710 --> 04:10:56,110
To be honest, I have no motivation at all.

5214
04:11:16,430 --> 04:11:18,610
If I don't beat it now, I'm never playing again.

5215
04:11:18,830 --> 04:11:21,190
So, I don't think that's really an option for me.

5216
04:11:24,490 --> 04:11:24,930
Sorry.

5217
04:11:27,950 --> 04:11:31,670
I'm just having not such a good day today.

5218
04:11:31,930 --> 04:11:36,010
So, I'm just kind of like feeling a little unmotivated.

5219
04:12:14,760 --> 04:12:15,320
Did

5220
04:12:27,440 --> 04:12:28,360
you steal my goggles?

5221
04:12:56,400 --> 04:12:57,520
So, clear?

5222
04:12:58,860 --> 04:13:01,060
Oh, he took the God Mode but not the ring.

5223
04:13:06,920 --> 04:13:07,480
Okay.

5224
04:13:23,870 --> 04:13:24,870
Oh, shit.

5225
04:13:43,080 --> 04:13:43,680
Come on!

5226
04:13:43,680 --> 04:13:43,900
Mr. Fox.

5227
04:13:47,420 --> 04:13:49,740
Oh, come on!

5228
04:13:55,890 --> 04:13:56,490
No!

5229
04:13:56,490 --> 04:13:57,090
Take...

5230
04:13:57,930 --> 04:13:58,230
Just...

5231
04:13:58,890 --> 04:14:01,170
I'd rather you take my health than...

5232
04:14:01,170 --> 04:14:01,610
Oh, my God.

5233
04:14:01,690 --> 04:14:01,950
Please.

5234
04:14:03,430 --> 04:14:04,030
Okay.

5235
04:14:04,130 --> 04:14:04,350
No.

5236
04:14:04,450 --> 04:14:04,870
That's fine.

5237
04:14:04,910 --> 04:14:05,430
Mr. Star.

5238
04:14:08,830 --> 04:14:09,930
Mr. Star.

5239
04:14:10,270 --> 04:14:10,470
No!

5240
04:14:12,970 --> 04:14:14,170
Mr. Star.

5241
04:14:29,620 --> 04:14:30,560
Come on!

5242
04:14:34,880 --> 04:14:36,540
My blood bag!

5243
04:14:36,820 --> 04:14:38,780
I keep forgetting that I have that even.

5244
04:14:39,800 --> 04:14:45,860
Probably because they gave it to me so late in the game that I completely forgot I owned it.

5245
04:14:51,680 --> 04:14:54,640
Looking to my... I pressed up.

5246
04:14:54,860 --> 04:14:56,680
There goes the god mode artifact.

5247
04:14:57,240 --> 04:14:59,780
So you take the blood bag and...

5248
04:15:13,330 --> 04:15:17,180
What's my health at anyway?

5249
04:15:45,680 --> 04:15:48,120
This part's so annoying though!

5250
04:15:50,540 --> 04:15:52,100
This part's the annoying part!

5251
04:16:02,420 --> 04:16:04,940
And I stole my bandages again!

5252
04:16:06,300 --> 04:16:09,380
There should be some items that you're not allowed to steal.

5253
04:16:10,520 --> 04:16:11,340
I swear.

5254
04:16:11,680 --> 04:16:15,060
There should be some things that you're not allowed to take.

5255
04:16:15,440 --> 04:16:16,380
It's just not fair.

5256
04:16:22,680 --> 04:16:23,860
So I have to...

5257
04:16:25,440 --> 04:16:26,600
I have to EMP.

5258
04:16:40,810 --> 04:16:42,010
EMP plus gun.

5259
04:16:44,730 --> 04:16:45,990
I guess we'll see.

5260
04:16:53,700 --> 04:16:55,820
I have to be like lined up, you know?

5261
04:17:13,250 --> 04:17:14,790
Let me try a grenade.

5262
04:17:14,910 --> 04:17:16,670
It's not gonna be fast enough but...

5263
04:17:17,350 --> 04:17:18,770
It wasn't fast enough!

5264
04:17:18,830 --> 04:17:19,790
It was not fast enough!

5265
04:17:46,440 --> 04:17:48,540
Oh, that's kind of a surprise.

5266
04:17:50,400 --> 04:17:53,540
Oh my god!

5267
04:17:53,540 --> 04:17:54,000
This is so annoying.

5268
04:17:54,000 --> 04:17:54,860
It's a no.

5269
04:17:55,040 --> 04:17:58,020
It's in the way of safety?

5270
04:17:58,080 --> 04:17:58,180
Yeah, it's in the way of safety!

5271
04:17:58,180 --> 04:18:01,300
Oh, oh, that's so fun!

5272
04:18:01,300 --> 04:18:01,360
You're such a drunk!

5273
04:18:01,380 --> 04:18:02,980
That's just so good!

5274
04:18:08,880 --> 04:18:09,760
I

5275
04:18:28,020 --> 04:18:32,860
think punching does the same damage than the gun.

5276
04:18:33,660 --> 04:18:35,700
This really sucks.

5277
04:18:35,920 --> 04:18:36,700
This just sucks.

5278
04:18:37,520 --> 04:18:39,320
This just sucks.

5279
04:18:46,870 --> 04:18:54,190
If I'm not lined up perfectly, I just entirely missed the opportunity!

5280
04:18:55,130 --> 04:18:56,610
It's the EMP.

5281
04:19:02,980 --> 04:19:08,790
And I'm basically wasting them at this point.

5282
04:19:34,850 --> 04:19:37,150
How did you get over there so fast?

5283
04:19:51,160 --> 04:19:52,920
That was lucky.

5284
04:19:58,320 --> 04:19:59,600
And that's it.

5285
04:19:59,760 --> 04:20:00,400
That's game too.

5286
04:20:01,300 --> 04:20:04,180
That's game because I don't have any other health.

5287
04:20:04,340 --> 04:20:06,260
Unless I can clutch it somehow.

5288
04:20:06,680 --> 04:20:07,760
I have no health.

5289
04:20:11,500 --> 04:20:11,940
Should

5290
04:20:33,950 --> 04:20:35,450
we try the fire extinguisher?

5291
04:20:53,320 --> 04:20:55,380
And the game gives you nothing.

5292
04:20:56,140 --> 04:20:58,620
It does not give you any more grenades.

5293
04:20:58,720 --> 04:21:00,100
It does not give you any more anything.

5294
04:21:09,760 --> 04:21:10,240
Just...

5295
04:21:14,100 --> 04:21:14,580
Unfair.

5296
04:21:19,080 --> 04:21:20,480
Sorry if the dev is still here.

5297
04:21:20,600 --> 04:21:22,040
I am really having a bad day.

5298
04:21:22,140 --> 04:21:24,860
Usually, my patience is much better than this.

5299
04:21:25,860 --> 04:21:30,260
Today, I'm just not here for cheap tricks.

5300
04:21:31,580 --> 04:21:33,420
I'm really sorry if you're still listening.

5301
04:21:36,420 --> 04:21:38,180
I'm just really not having a good day.

5302
04:21:38,180 --> 04:21:39,880
It's so...

5303
04:21:39,880 --> 04:21:43,240
If I'm like getting screwed over, I'm like...

5304
04:21:43,240 --> 04:21:44,280
So...

5305
04:21:44,280 --> 04:21:44,820
Oh, shit.

5306
04:21:44,860 --> 04:21:46,020
I'm so annoyed by it.

5307
04:21:49,460 --> 04:21:50,960
Ah, fuck you!

5308
04:21:51,500 --> 04:21:52,680
Where's the cooldown?

5309
04:21:53,480 --> 04:21:54,640
Where's the cooldown?

5310
04:22:06,300 --> 04:22:08,680
Do you have many bullets left, Fox?

5311
04:22:08,960 --> 04:22:10,280
I imagine not.

5312
04:22:10,320 --> 04:22:11,740
I suspect you've...

5313
04:22:11,740 --> 04:22:11,840
...

5314
04:22:15,340 --> 04:22:16,500
OMG.

5315
04:22:16,500 --> 04:22:17,480
I have so many bullets...

5316
04:22:17,480 --> 04:22:19,040
...

5317
04:22:19,040 --> 04:22:20,020
What are you doing?

5318
04:22:20,020 --> 04:22:21,520
Some changes have already been made.

5319
04:22:24,480 --> 04:22:28,040
I just hide in this far...

5320
04:22:28,040 --> 04:22:40,740
There's an awful word I don't understand about enemies.

5321
04:23:13,520 --> 04:23:19,920
Also, I wish these guys would come from the same spot, so I could at least time that better.

5322
04:23:24,810 --> 04:23:25,510
Oh shit.

5323
04:23:25,670 --> 04:23:26,570
Oh my god.

5324
04:24:02,680 --> 04:24:04,940
Guess I'm not doing what I wanted to do today.

5325
04:24:04,940 --> 04:24:05,300
Haha.

5326
04:24:53,000 --> 04:24:54,680
And it

5327
04:25:10,920 --> 04:25:11,140
is!

5328
04:25:12,380 --> 04:25:15,560
At the very last second, he stole them!

5329
04:25:16,080 --> 04:25:17,340
No way!

5330
04:25:25,980 --> 04:25:27,460
It's so unfair.

5331
04:25:30,340 --> 04:25:32,480
I don't have the ring anymore, no.

5332
04:25:40,240 --> 04:25:43,420
At the fire extinguisher, I tried pressing C.

5333
04:25:43,540 --> 04:25:45,140
I don't want to try pressing C.

5334
04:25:48,320 --> 04:25:50,440
Unless I know it actually works.

5335
04:25:56,320 --> 04:25:57,580
I have a blood pact?

5336
04:25:57,760 --> 04:25:58,320
Oh, you're right.

5337
04:25:58,400 --> 04:25:59,200
I do have the blood pact.

5338
04:25:59,740 --> 04:26:00,480
You're right.

5339
04:26:21,280 --> 04:26:21,980
No!

5340
04:26:22,060 --> 04:26:22,300
No!

5341
04:26:22,400 --> 04:26:23,900
I'm too stubborn!

5342
04:26:32,500 --> 04:26:33,200
Let

5343
04:26:47,620 --> 04:26:49,340
me see what time it closes.

5344
04:27:07,230 --> 04:27:07,930
No!

5345
04:27:13,450 --> 04:27:15,490
Not gonna do it in another stream.

5346
04:27:15,850 --> 04:27:17,170
Now or never!

5347
04:27:17,290 --> 04:27:17,950
No!

5348
04:27:45,680 --> 04:27:47,960
I don't want to do it in another stream.

5349
04:27:48,060 --> 04:27:48,240
No!

5350
04:27:53,010 --> 04:27:53,730
No!

5351
04:27:53,730 --> 04:27:57,030
I don't want to do it in another stream.

5352
04:28:01,010 --> 04:28:01,570
No!

5353
04:28:01,950 --> 04:28:02,070
No!

5354
04:28:02,070 --> 04:28:02,190
No!

5355
04:28:02,830 --> 04:28:02,850
No!

5356
04:28:03,130 --> 04:28:03,230
No!

5357
04:28:04,190 --> 04:28:04,470
No!

5358
04:28:04,470 --> 04:28:04,510
No!

5359
04:28:04,510 --> 04:28:04,590
No!

5360
04:28:07,070 --> 04:28:07,630
No!

5361
04:28:13,590 --> 04:28:14,150
No!

5362
04:28:14,150 --> 04:28:16,030
Did he just take one of my first aid kits?!

5363
04:28:16,030 --> 04:28:19,430
You managed to injure me, Mr. Fox.

5364
04:28:20,330 --> 04:28:22,830
Sincerely, this was beyond my expectations.

5365
04:28:23,430 --> 04:28:25,750
Luckily, you've brought my first aid kits.

5366
04:28:25,950 --> 04:28:28,130
But you don't mind that you're missing one.

5367
04:28:28,410 --> 04:28:30,850
So, you've been stealing my stuff.

5368
04:28:31,210 --> 04:28:32,270
Your stuff?

5369
04:28:32,470 --> 04:28:35,790
Everything you've acquired is from my base, Mr. Fox.

5370
04:28:36,010 --> 04:28:41,750
And as the proverb states, one who steals from a thief will receive a hundred years of pardon.

5371
04:28:41,750 --> 04:28:46,250
That bastard had been stealing from me while I was busy destroying his machines.

5372
04:28:46,970 --> 04:28:50,450
And I'm sure he was going to steal more stuff as he needed it.

5373
04:28:51,770 --> 04:28:53,530
Oh my god, no, no!

5374
04:28:55,450 --> 04:28:56,350
I can't.

5375
04:29:16,940 --> 04:29:19,180
Could I, like, lace it with poison?

5376
04:29:20,020 --> 04:29:21,680
I'm gonna pee all over it!

5377
04:29:22,000 --> 04:29:23,840
I'm gonna pee all over your grenade!

5378
04:29:24,840 --> 04:29:26,300
Or your first aid kit!

5379
04:29:26,980 --> 04:29:29,300
I'm gonna pee all over your first aid kit!

5380
04:29:29,720 --> 04:29:31,120
Eat the first aid kit!

5381
04:29:31,200 --> 04:29:31,960
I'm gonna eat them!

5382
04:29:33,480 --> 04:29:34,640
Oh my god!

5383
04:29:46,060 --> 04:29:48,380
If only I had the invulnerability.

5384
04:30:01,780 --> 04:30:03,140
What's my health at, anyway?

5385
04:30:03,540 --> 04:30:04,160
Oh, okay.

5386
04:30:06,920 --> 04:30:07,400
Close.

5387
04:30:33,560 --> 04:30:35,420
This is so unfair!

5388
04:30:36,940 --> 04:30:39,280
No, this is an absolute...

5389
04:30:39,280 --> 04:30:40,460
You won't run out of first aid kits, Mr. Fox.

5390
04:30:40,700 --> 04:30:44,080
Unfortunately, you'll be unable to heal yourself anymore.

5391
04:30:44,640 --> 04:30:47,540
Fortunately, it also means that you've run out of them.

5392
04:30:47,800 --> 04:30:49,700
Which adds to the thrill.

5393
04:30:49,880 --> 04:30:51,680
Let the best man win.

5394
04:30:52,100 --> 04:30:54,840
I only have four grenades left.

5395
04:30:56,920 --> 04:30:58,700
What the fuck?

5396
04:30:59,900 --> 04:31:01,100
You bastard!

5397
04:31:01,740 --> 04:31:02,900
Mr. Fox.

5398
04:31:02,900 --> 04:31:03,480
Did you just stab me?

5399
04:31:03,520 --> 04:31:05,860
You complain because I remove your belongings.

5400
04:31:06,160 --> 04:31:08,740
And now you complain again when I return them.

5401
04:31:08,940 --> 04:31:09,460
What?

5402
04:31:09,920 --> 04:31:10,660
Cheer up.

5403
04:31:10,740 --> 04:31:12,860
I simply gave back your rusty wire.

5404
04:31:13,140 --> 04:31:15,600
Although, maybe I've been a little brusque.

5405
04:31:15,760 --> 04:31:17,660
You can find it between your ribs.

5406
04:31:18,000 --> 04:31:19,560
By the way, Mr. Fox.

5407
04:31:19,820 --> 04:31:22,940
Let's see if you can kill me before bleeding to death.

5408
04:31:23,660 --> 04:31:24,540
Good luck.

5409
04:31:28,760 --> 04:31:30,220
I do have a blood bag.

5410
04:31:33,160 --> 04:31:33,860
What the...

5411
04:31:33,860 --> 04:31:34,740
What the hell?

5412
04:31:42,360 --> 04:31:43,220
No, I know I'm full.

5413
04:31:43,340 --> 04:31:43,780
I know I'm full.

5414
04:31:43,820 --> 04:31:44,320
I know I'm full.

5415
04:31:46,260 --> 04:31:47,200
I know I'm full.

5416
04:31:47,620 --> 04:31:48,460
I'm just...

5417
04:31:49,120 --> 04:31:49,540
I'm...

5418
04:31:49,960 --> 04:31:50,380
I'm...

5419
04:31:50,810 --> 04:31:52,260
I'm shocked right now.

5420
04:31:53,280 --> 04:31:53,700
I'm...

5421
04:31:56,740 --> 04:31:58,000
Can I stab him?

5422
04:31:58,400 --> 04:31:59,080
You think?

5423
04:31:59,540 --> 04:31:59,970
You think?

5424
04:32:02,540 --> 04:32:02,800
You think?

5425
04:32:02,800 --> 04:32:02,880
You think?

5426
04:32:02,880 --> 04:32:05,080
How the hell am I supposed to save?

5427
04:32:08,260 --> 04:32:10,360
How the hell am I supposed to save?

5428
04:32:11,640 --> 04:32:12,860
Oh my gosh.

5429
04:32:19,180 --> 04:32:20,640
Fuck you, man.

5430
04:32:50,360 --> 04:32:55,120
I don't think the rusty wire does anything unless I'm...

5431
04:32:55,120 --> 04:32:56,340
Oh, I have no more.

5432
04:32:56,500 --> 04:32:57,400
I have no more.

5433
04:33:04,560 --> 04:33:06,040
I think that's it, you guys.

5434
04:33:06,140 --> 04:33:06,780
I think that's it.

5435
04:33:07,300 --> 04:33:08,800
I think it's softlocked now.

5436
04:33:09,240 --> 04:33:10,640
I think it's softlocked.

5437
04:33:16,030 --> 04:33:17,170
It's softlocked, I think.

5438
04:33:18,770 --> 04:33:19,650
Regular grenades.

5439
04:33:21,050 --> 04:33:22,010
What's my health at?

5440
04:33:22,610 --> 04:33:23,050
Okay.

5441
04:33:23,130 --> 04:33:24,270
I might use the...

5442
04:33:45,560 --> 04:33:47,220
You can't hit him without EMPs.

5443
04:33:47,740 --> 04:33:49,280
Yeah, I think he can only...

5444
04:33:49,760 --> 04:33:53,300
I think he only shows up when I make him show up.

5445
04:33:53,360 --> 04:33:54,880
I don't think I can hit him otherwise.

5446
04:33:54,960 --> 04:33:55,620
I don't think so.

5447
04:33:59,100 --> 04:34:00,180
Punch in his spot?

5448
04:34:00,400 --> 04:34:00,800
Okay.

5449
04:34:01,240 --> 04:34:02,160
Okay, we'll try.

5450
04:34:03,560 --> 04:34:04,360
I don't...

5451
04:34:09,240 --> 04:34:11,020
You can hit him when he's shooting.

5452
04:34:11,220 --> 04:34:11,620
Okay.

5453
04:34:13,140 --> 04:34:13,540
Okay.

5454
04:34:15,080 --> 04:34:17,020
I think I'm gonna use this, though.

5455
04:34:23,120 --> 04:34:23,560
Guys,

5456
04:34:29,070 --> 04:34:29,830
it's so over.

5457
04:34:31,870 --> 04:34:32,750
It's over.

5458
04:34:32,970 --> 04:34:33,370
It's over.

5459
04:34:33,450 --> 04:34:33,890
It's over.

5460
04:34:34,510 --> 04:34:35,450
It's so over.

5461
04:34:35,610 --> 04:34:36,170
It's so over.

5462
04:34:38,170 --> 04:34:39,230
Oh my god.

5463
04:34:39,290 --> 04:34:39,750
It's so...

5464
04:34:39,750 --> 04:34:40,450
It's over.

5465
04:34:40,610 --> 04:34:41,230
Yeah, it's over.

5466
04:34:42,190 --> 04:34:42,630
Yeah.

5467
04:34:42,670 --> 04:34:44,110
I don't think there's a way to...

5468
04:34:46,110 --> 04:34:49,690
Unless I'm gonna grenade him very specifically.

5469
04:34:51,310 --> 04:34:52,050
I'm

5470
04:35:06,480 --> 04:35:07,660
really softlocked.

5471
04:35:07,720 --> 04:35:09,640
I think I only missed like two...

5472
04:35:10,480 --> 04:35:11,880
I only...

5473
04:35:11,880 --> 04:35:16,600
Like I only missed two shots of...

5474
04:35:16,600 --> 04:35:22,720
So I have to be absolutely a hundred percent perfect with the electromagnetic grenades?

5475
04:35:22,940 --> 04:35:23,880
Like that's just unfair.

5476
04:35:30,260 --> 04:35:31,580
I have eleven.

5477
04:35:31,580 --> 04:35:33,900
I think I picked up all that I could.

5478
04:35:43,290 --> 04:35:46,170
Use the medkits first so he can't heal.

5479
04:35:54,310 --> 04:35:58,130
You have to waste your heals before third phase?

5480
04:35:58,800 --> 04:35:59,770
So I have to...

5481
04:35:59,770 --> 04:36:00,970
What?

5482
04:36:07,260 --> 04:36:07,920
Okay...

5483
04:36:09,680 --> 04:36:10,340
Okay...

5484
04:36:11,660 --> 04:36:12,320
Okay...

5485
04:36:17,160 --> 04:36:17,740
Uh-uh.

5486
04:36:23,420 --> 04:36:25,440
He already took my god mode.

5487
04:36:25,500 --> 04:36:26,040
That's crazy.

5488
04:36:43,500 --> 04:36:44,300
I didn't.

5489
04:36:45,640 --> 04:36:46,300
Oh my god.

5490
04:36:47,180 --> 04:36:49,420
Well, this is one way to use him up, I guess.

5491
04:36:52,680 --> 04:36:54,280
This is one way to use him up, I guess.

5492
04:37:19,770 --> 04:37:21,130
Before phase three?

5493
04:37:23,630 --> 04:37:24,590
So like now?

5494
04:37:25,350 --> 04:37:26,210
So like now?

5495
04:37:27,550 --> 04:37:28,730
Oh wait, I think I...

5496
04:37:30,030 --> 04:37:30,470
Okay.

5497
04:37:30,790 --> 04:37:31,630
And one more!

5498
04:37:31,910 --> 04:37:32,610
We use one more!

5499
04:37:36,490 --> 04:37:36,930
Oh.

5500
04:37:39,470 --> 04:37:41,090
It won't let me use it again.

5501
04:37:58,510 --> 04:38:00,450
Use it before he hits two-thirds health.

5502
04:38:00,610 --> 04:38:01,190
Okay, okay, okay.

5503
04:38:03,190 --> 04:38:04,570
I think he was like over here.

5504
04:38:04,670 --> 04:38:05,390
But I'm gonna wait.

5505
04:38:09,030 --> 04:38:09,410
Okay.

5506
04:38:17,640 --> 04:38:18,900
Wait, I'm not using the gun.

5507
04:38:19,020 --> 04:38:19,440
Okay, hold on.

5508
04:38:21,220 --> 04:38:22,720
Okay, okay, hold on.

5509
04:38:22,780 --> 04:38:23,060
Hold on.

5510
04:38:23,080 --> 04:38:25,260
Sorry, I'm like getting a little cross-eyed here.

5511
04:38:27,880 --> 04:38:29,800
Okay, that was a waste of my time.

5512
04:38:29,980 --> 04:38:30,980
That's okay though, I guess.

5513
04:38:54,200 --> 04:38:54,580
Nice.

5514
04:39:14,890 --> 04:39:19,270
I have underestimated you, Mr. Fox.

5515
04:39:20,970 --> 04:39:22,090
Boss defeated.

5516
04:39:25,730 --> 04:39:26,290
No.

5517
04:39:33,700 --> 04:39:35,320
What are you waiting for?

5518
04:39:35,940 --> 04:39:36,820
Finish me?

5519
04:39:37,280 --> 04:39:39,380
Time without payin' for your crimes?

5520
04:39:39,620 --> 04:39:40,000
What are you waiting for?

5521
04:39:40,000 --> 04:39:40,380
No way.

5522
04:39:40,800 --> 04:39:42,840
I'll take you to a trial so they can go in the woods.

5523
04:39:42,840 --> 04:39:46,740
They condemn you and lock you in a cell to rot for the rest of your life.

5524
04:39:47,720 --> 04:39:48,680
I see.

5525
04:39:49,400 --> 04:39:50,720
Tell me, Mr. Fox.

5526
04:39:51,080 --> 04:39:54,000
How are you going to take me if you can't move?

5527
04:39:54,400 --> 04:39:54,880
What?

5528
04:39:59,170 --> 04:40:00,850
You're so predictable.

5529
04:40:01,490 --> 04:40:04,810
I knew you wouldn't kill me or let me die.

5530
04:40:05,090 --> 04:40:11,410
Just like all of my other subordinates, they consistently led you directly into my trap, Mr. Fox.

5531
04:40:12,130 --> 04:40:16,930
Honestly, I hoped you were going to surprise me again, like that little spark in the basement.

5532
04:40:17,130 --> 04:40:20,210
But once more, the pen is mightier than the sword.

5533
04:40:20,410 --> 04:40:24,230
By the way, thanks for volunteering to test my new paralyzer.

5534
04:40:24,410 --> 04:40:28,270
The discharge it releases shuts down the whole peripheral nervous system.

5535
04:40:30,990 --> 04:40:32,810
Oh, and then we die.

5536
04:40:34,410 --> 04:40:34,930
That's it.

5537
04:40:35,030 --> 04:40:36,910
You should have killed me when you had the chance.

5538
04:40:37,030 --> 04:40:39,290
See you never, Mr. Fox.

5539
04:40:43,770 --> 04:40:44,290
Colonel!

5540
04:40:46,770 --> 04:40:47,850
Oh my god!

5541
04:40:48,550 --> 04:40:49,530
Are you alright, sir?

5542
04:40:49,690 --> 04:40:50,270
Oh my god!

5543
04:40:53,550 --> 04:40:54,270
Don't worry.

5544
04:40:54,590 --> 04:40:56,950
The effects on the paralysis will wear off soon.

5545
04:40:56,950 --> 04:40:58,610
Ugh, my hands are shaking so much.

5546
04:40:58,610 --> 04:40:59,770
But it's not prudent to stay here.

5547
04:41:00,090 --> 04:41:01,830
Come on, stand up, Fox.

5548
04:41:01,970 --> 04:41:02,890
I'll help you up.

5549
04:41:03,270 --> 04:41:03,790
From how hungry are you?

5550
04:41:03,790 --> 04:41:04,490
Oh gosh.

5551
04:41:04,990 --> 04:41:08,290
I guess I'll go get some easy konbini food after this.

5552
04:41:13,150 --> 04:41:13,630
Colonel!

5553
04:41:18,120 --> 04:41:19,080
Stage complete!

5554
04:41:21,940 --> 04:41:23,380
I had a secret.

5555
04:41:23,480 --> 04:41:24,080
What was the secret?

5556
04:41:25,600 --> 04:41:27,920
Colonel Harris and I went to the helicopter.

5557
04:41:28,400 --> 04:41:29,620
Finish the game!

5558
04:41:29,780 --> 04:41:32,900
A few minutes later, when I regained my motor skills, we took off.

5559
04:41:33,180 --> 04:41:34,000
Oh my gosh.

5560
04:41:35,260 --> 04:41:38,160
Lieutenant, we have the forensic report of the carbonized corpse.

5561
04:41:38,420 --> 04:41:38,820
Who is it?

5562
04:41:38,860 --> 04:41:39,640
Hand it to the sergeant.

5563
04:41:39,880 --> 04:41:40,360
Dismissed.

5564
04:41:40,420 --> 04:41:41,060
Yes, sir.

5565
04:41:41,260 --> 04:41:44,120
Looks like we can finally prove that Mr. Fox has been lying.

5566
04:41:44,220 --> 04:41:44,380
Is that Victory Mail?

5567
04:41:44,380 --> 04:41:44,640
I feel like it.

5568
04:41:44,800 --> 04:41:46,160
Sergeant, what does the report say?

5569
04:41:46,240 --> 04:41:46,980
Freaking did it, you guys!

5570
04:41:47,420 --> 04:41:48,680
I said I would and I did.

5571
04:41:48,680 --> 04:41:51,240
The physiological study confirms that the corpse with identification C4423...

5572
04:41:51,240 --> 04:41:52,360
I thought it was going to be like...

5573
04:41:52,360 --> 04:41:53,940
...measures three inches taller than Colonel Alan Harris.

5574
04:41:53,940 --> 04:41:54,920
Two to three hours more.

5575
04:41:55,040 --> 04:41:55,520
Not this much.

5576
04:41:56,760 --> 04:41:57,780
...disproving his identity.

5577
04:41:58,020 --> 04:41:58,640
I'll just, uh...

5578
04:41:58,640 --> 04:41:58,800
What?

5579
04:41:59,440 --> 04:42:00,780
Then he's not the Colonel.

5580
04:42:01,140 --> 04:42:01,980
Of course not.

5581
04:42:02,080 --> 04:42:02,920
I told you, Sergeant.

5582
04:42:03,620 --> 04:42:05,340
Care to explain this, Mr. Fox?

5583
04:42:05,700 --> 04:42:10,040
Are you going to tell us that he was tortured on a rack until it stretched him three inches?

5584
04:42:10,500 --> 04:42:11,700
That would be ridiculous.

5585
04:42:12,340 --> 04:42:13,660
He's not Colonel Harris.

5586
04:42:13,660 --> 04:42:15,120
I never said he was.

5587
04:42:15,500 --> 04:42:16,440
You what?

5588
04:42:16,580 --> 04:42:19,260
You just told us that you both flew away in that helicopter.

5589
04:42:19,780 --> 04:42:24,500
I told you we escaped together, but never said that corpse was Colonel Harris.

5590
04:42:24,860 --> 04:42:28,100
In fact, I have no idea who it is.

5591
04:42:28,480 --> 04:42:30,820
Are you sure you found it in the helicopter?

5592
04:42:31,360 --> 04:42:34,220
Did you plan it yourselves to incriminate me?

5593
04:42:34,320 --> 04:42:35,960
Like some dirty cops?

5594
04:42:36,460 --> 04:42:37,700
How dared you?

5595
04:42:38,860 --> 04:42:40,580
Enough games, Mr. Fox.

5596
04:42:40,700 --> 04:42:40,860
Enough.

5597
04:42:41,060 --> 04:42:43,100
We'll find out who you are and then we'll execute you.

5598
04:42:43,100 --> 04:42:43,760
I'm just a guy.

5599
04:42:44,280 --> 04:42:45,160
What now?

5600
04:42:46,420 --> 04:42:46,940
Colonel!

5601
04:42:47,020 --> 04:42:48,420
What the hell is happening in here?

5602
04:42:49,280 --> 04:42:50,860
Colonel in the room, salute.

5603
04:42:51,220 --> 04:42:52,240
Colonel in the room.

5604
04:42:52,540 --> 04:42:52,940
At ease.

5605
04:42:54,040 --> 04:42:54,880
Colonel Harris?

5606
04:42:55,280 --> 04:42:56,560
You're alive.

5607
04:42:56,900 --> 04:42:57,220
Yes.

5608
04:42:57,360 --> 04:42:59,260
Sir, we thought you passed away.

5609
04:42:59,620 --> 04:43:02,380
As you can see, Lieutenant, I'm alive and kicking.

5610
04:43:03,140 --> 04:43:05,080
Why is this man handcuffed?

5611
04:43:05,320 --> 04:43:06,600
We were interrogating him.

5612
04:43:06,660 --> 04:43:08,120
He's a spy that we captured, sir.

5613
04:43:08,360 --> 04:43:09,120
A spy?

5614
04:43:09,480 --> 04:43:11,100
Are you pulling my leg?

5615
04:43:11,100 --> 04:43:15,580
He's a civilian who was imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit.

5616
04:43:15,860 --> 04:43:23,080
He's also the man that not only saved my life and freed me from the ex-army base, but also...

5617
04:43:23,080 --> 04:43:23,420
Also?

5618
04:43:23,960 --> 04:43:30,760
He found classified information about Operation Jericho that will be essential in stopping the ex-army.

5619
04:43:30,840 --> 04:43:34,100
For goodness sakes, that man's a fucking hero.

5620
04:43:34,200 --> 04:43:34,280
Release him immediately.

5621
04:43:34,280 --> 04:43:34,540
At ease, everybody.

5622
04:43:34,820 --> 04:43:35,120
At ease.

5623
04:43:35,200 --> 04:43:35,680
Wisps.

5624
04:43:35,680 --> 04:43:36,100
At ease.

5625
04:43:36,220 --> 04:43:36,520
Wisps.

5626
04:43:36,540 --> 04:43:37,320
Yes, sir.

5627
04:43:37,520 --> 04:43:40,100
Did you tell them you're heroic feet, Fox?

5628
04:43:40,100 --> 04:43:42,940
I was that when we entered the helicopter, Colonel.

5629
04:43:43,240 --> 04:43:45,560
But it looks like they found a corpse in the helicopter.

5630
04:43:45,920 --> 04:43:47,860
But, fuck, I don't know who he is.

5631
04:43:48,140 --> 04:43:50,240
They say he has a bullet in his head.

5632
04:43:50,380 --> 04:43:51,780
And it came from my gun.

5633
04:43:52,120 --> 04:43:53,500
But I haven't killed anyone.

5634
04:43:54,040 --> 04:43:56,000
That corpse was General X.

5635
04:43:56,180 --> 04:43:58,040
I killed him with your gun myself.

5636
04:43:58,520 --> 04:43:59,300
Don't you remember?

5637
04:43:59,860 --> 04:44:00,820
Yeah, that makes sense.

5638
04:44:00,920 --> 04:44:04,300
So you just, like, pulled his body on the helicopter?

5639
04:44:04,300 --> 04:44:06,080
See, you'll never, General X.

5640
04:44:07,940 --> 04:44:09,980
But where did he get the news from?

5641
04:44:09,980 --> 04:44:11,520
From the senses inside the helicopter.

5642
04:44:12,020 --> 04:44:16,600
I retrieved General X's corpse and dragged it to the helicopter's aft.

5643
04:44:16,620 --> 04:44:18,380
That bastard was heavy.

5644
04:44:18,560 --> 04:44:19,600
In the air.

5645
04:44:19,860 --> 04:44:21,200
You know what happened.

5646
04:44:22,460 --> 04:44:23,700
Hurry up, Fox.

5647
04:44:24,020 --> 04:44:24,880
They're following us.

5648
04:44:24,880 --> 04:44:26,120
Oh my gosh, he looks like Plissken right now.

5649
04:44:26,440 --> 04:44:26,980
Don't rush me, Colonel.

5650
04:44:27,320 --> 04:44:28,700
I'm getting used to the controls.

5651
04:44:29,120 --> 04:44:32,480
This piece of junk has levers and buttons everywhere.

5652
04:44:32,500 --> 04:44:34,020
Wait, so he's literally just a civilian?

5653
04:44:34,520 --> 04:44:34,520
But don't panic.

5654
04:44:34,540 --> 04:44:37,900
I think we'll be able to reach allied territory before they catch up.

5655
04:44:37,900 --> 04:44:40,220
Then I'll call the cavalry.

5656
04:44:41,520 --> 04:44:42,120
Oh.

5657
04:44:42,440 --> 04:44:44,320
Charlie, Alpha, Charlie, Alpha.

5658
04:44:44,760 --> 04:44:47,660
Wait, but then they shoot them down, don't they?

5659
04:44:49,260 --> 04:44:50,120
Damn it.

5660
04:44:50,120 --> 04:44:51,760
This radio isn't working.

5661
04:44:52,020 --> 04:44:53,360
Fucking piece of shit.

5662
04:44:54,020 --> 04:44:55,080
Don't worry, Colonel.

5663
04:44:55,300 --> 04:44:58,260
As soon as we reach allied territory, they'll stop pursuing us.

5664
04:44:58,440 --> 04:44:59,160
Yeah, maybe.

5665
04:44:59,400 --> 04:44:59,880
Don't worry.

5666
04:45:00,320 --> 04:45:06,500
Son, with no radio, when this fully armed piece of Soviet junk pings their radar...

5667
04:45:06,500 --> 04:45:06,580
Oh.

5668
04:45:06,800 --> 04:45:11,060
The first thing they're gonna do when we don't answer is dig us down.

5669
04:45:11,340 --> 04:45:12,020
If we're in trouble.

5670
04:45:12,440 --> 04:45:12,760
Fuck.

5671
04:45:13,120 --> 04:45:14,940
So we'll be shot at if we keep going?

5672
04:45:15,020 --> 04:45:16,980
Or we'll be shot at when we turn around?

5673
04:45:17,400 --> 04:45:18,280
It's just some guy?

5674
04:45:18,300 --> 04:45:18,560
Affirmative.

5675
04:45:18,820 --> 04:45:20,900
We're between a rock and a hard place.

5676
04:45:21,340 --> 04:45:24,460
We'll abandon the helicopter as soon as we cross the border.

5677
04:45:24,660 --> 04:45:24,900
Okay.

5678
04:45:25,020 --> 04:45:26,760
I'm gonna search for the parachutes.

5679
04:45:26,860 --> 04:45:27,080
Okay.

5680
04:45:27,820 --> 04:45:31,260
But jumping would still be risky in this jungle terrain.

5681
04:45:31,580 --> 04:45:33,120
Charlie, Alpha, Charlie, Alpha.

5682
04:45:33,720 --> 04:45:34,640
We're nearly there.

5683
04:45:34,640 --> 04:45:36,600
There's only one, Fox.

5684
04:45:36,980 --> 04:45:39,440
You jump and deliver the documents to the allies.

5685
04:45:39,440 --> 04:45:39,960
No, Colonel!

5686
04:45:40,500 --> 04:45:41,800
Are you insane, Colonel?

5687
04:45:42,040 --> 04:45:43,200
They won't believe me.

5688
04:45:43,480 --> 04:45:45,700
And you don't know how to pilot this junk.

5689
04:45:46,160 --> 04:45:47,720
And why do you know?

5690
04:45:48,340 --> 04:45:49,220
You're young.

5691
04:45:49,580 --> 04:45:51,720
You have your life ahead of you, son.

5692
04:45:51,960 --> 04:45:53,140
Take this ring.

5693
04:45:53,460 --> 04:45:54,580
Show it to them.

5694
04:45:55,200 --> 04:45:56,320
They'll believe you.

5695
04:45:56,740 --> 04:45:58,340
It smells bad.

5696
04:45:58,560 --> 04:45:59,240
Fuckin' place of shit.

5697
04:46:00,160 --> 04:46:00,720
Why?

5698
04:46:00,780 --> 04:46:04,620
But that's because those asshole bastards were going to snatch it as they put their hands on it.

5699
04:46:04,620 --> 04:46:06,480
Was that important to you?

5700
04:46:06,900 --> 04:46:09,220
So I hid it in the only safe place I had left.

5701
04:46:09,660 --> 04:46:10,720
My ass.

5702
04:46:11,160 --> 04:46:12,140
Come on, son.

5703
04:46:12,240 --> 04:46:12,740
Put on the parachute.

5704
04:46:12,740 --> 04:46:13,280
My asthma.

5705
04:46:13,820 --> 04:46:16,880
Colonel, you need to jump and tell them everything yourself.

5706
04:46:16,880 --> 04:46:18,000
What is going on?

5707
04:46:18,740 --> 04:46:20,960
We argued about who had to jump.

5708
04:46:21,240 --> 04:46:26,020
And I had to admit that Mr. Fox had one convincing argument.

5709
04:46:26,440 --> 04:46:26,880
What's that?

5710
04:46:27,220 --> 04:46:28,680
Fox, what are you waiting for?

5711
04:46:29,280 --> 04:46:30,340
Hurry up, son.

5712
04:46:30,920 --> 04:46:32,160
We are running out of time.

5713
04:46:33,340 --> 04:46:34,600
I convinced him!

5714
04:46:34,600 --> 04:46:40,020
The next thing I remember was waking up, hanging from the parachute tangled to a tree.

5715
04:46:40,620 --> 04:46:44,680
The owner of a farm who spotted me arrived a few minutes later.

5716
04:46:46,380 --> 04:46:49,640
I like how the grenades were still the little thing.

5717
04:46:49,960 --> 04:46:53,820
He was so kind as to bring me here to the base.

5718
04:46:54,540 --> 04:46:58,460
The lieutenant and the sergeant were shocked and immediately apologized.

5719
04:47:00,560 --> 04:47:02,340
A few days later...

5720
04:47:02,340 --> 04:47:03,060
...

5721
04:47:03,060 --> 04:47:06,000
The army decorated me with two medals.

5722
04:47:06,260 --> 04:47:06,540
Wow.

5723
04:47:06,920 --> 04:47:14,540
Jesse Fox, for rescuing an MIA military colonel and recovering intelligence on Operation Jericho.

5724
04:47:14,980 --> 04:47:22,880
I, Colonel Alan Harris of the 5th Battalion, award you a purple cross.

5725
04:47:22,900 --> 04:47:24,840
Jesse Fox, you're a big fox?

5726
04:47:26,300 --> 04:47:28,360
That medal really exists?

5727
04:47:28,440 --> 04:47:30,280
Oh my god, the girl jumped scared me.

5728
04:47:30,420 --> 04:47:30,620
It didn't?

5729
04:47:30,620 --> 04:47:31,620
They had to invent it.

5730
04:47:31,720 --> 04:47:32,140
It didn't?

5731
04:47:32,140 --> 04:47:32,760
They had to invent it.

5732
04:47:32,760 --> 04:47:34,400
There was nothing that they could provide for a civilian.

5733
04:47:34,660 --> 04:47:35,800
The girl jump scared me.

5734
04:47:35,980 --> 04:47:37,740
The girl also awarded a Gandhi Medal of the National Idiot.

5735
04:47:37,740 --> 04:47:38,880
Female jump scare.

5736
04:47:41,100 --> 04:47:42,140
National Idiot?

5737
04:47:42,300 --> 04:47:42,420
National Idiot?

5738
04:47:42,500 --> 04:47:46,580
Well, I received it because I didn't kill any enemies at all during the escape.

5739
04:47:46,900 --> 04:47:50,540
As you know, militaries don't get why killing is wrong.

5740
04:47:50,920 --> 04:47:52,940
Well, at least we agree on that.

5741
04:47:53,300 --> 04:47:59,220
So, thanks to the documents I found, the allies could find and sink every related submarine.

5742
04:47:59,540 --> 04:47:59,980
Ooh!

5743
04:47:59,980 --> 04:48:04,880
The military base, docks, and Omega building were the targets of a large operation.

5744
04:48:05,500 --> 04:48:07,320
Everyone was arrested.

5745
04:48:07,680 --> 04:48:08,200
Where's the doc?

5746
04:48:08,860 --> 04:48:13,080
Robert the Paparazzi published the story and won a Pulitzer Prize.

5747
04:48:13,340 --> 04:48:13,860
Oh my gosh.

5748
04:48:14,880 --> 04:48:21,740
The two doctors and their two fathers dedicated themselves to finding a cure for cancer using nanonuclear weapons.

5749
04:48:22,220 --> 04:48:23,460
Wasn't it one doctor?

5750
04:48:23,620 --> 04:48:25,980
That's what they wanted us to believe.

5751
04:48:27,200 --> 04:48:29,240
The captain of that boat...

5752
04:48:29,240 --> 04:48:29,680
Died.

5753
04:48:29,980 --> 04:48:31,860
He retired with my 50 million dollars.

5754
04:48:32,260 --> 04:48:35,060
But he died of gonorrhea the week after.

5755
04:48:35,620 --> 04:48:36,220
Seriously?

5756
04:48:36,700 --> 04:48:37,300
Nah.

5757
04:48:37,480 --> 04:48:39,760
But, he would have deserved it.

5758
04:48:39,800 --> 04:48:40,100
Yes.

5759
04:48:40,800 --> 04:48:42,540
Do you remember Private Mike?

5760
04:48:42,660 --> 04:48:44,600
The one I found hammered and used to eat my tea?

5761
04:48:44,600 --> 04:48:44,600
Yes!

5762
04:48:44,600 --> 04:48:45,180
Private Mike!

5763
04:48:45,240 --> 04:48:45,780
Private Mike!

5764
04:48:45,860 --> 04:48:46,200
Private Mike!

5765
04:48:46,260 --> 04:48:50,360
Well, he could finally visit his daughter for her birthday.

5766
04:48:51,020 --> 04:48:51,620
Hello!

5767
04:48:53,080 --> 04:48:53,680
Daddy!

5768
04:48:54,840 --> 04:48:55,440
Daddy!

5769
04:48:55,960 --> 04:48:57,180
And I...

5770
04:48:57,180 --> 04:48:59,960
Went back to my old life as a smuggler.

5771
04:48:59,960 --> 04:49:01,040
The smuggling!

5772
04:49:03,740 --> 04:49:04,180
Wow.

5773
04:49:04,400 --> 04:49:07,360
Jessie, that's the most incredible story ever told.

5774
04:49:07,360 --> 04:49:08,160
What are we smuggling?

5775
04:49:08,340 --> 04:49:10,320
Oh my god, you have an amazing imagination.

5776
04:49:10,680 --> 04:49:11,800
You should be a video game writer.

5777
04:49:13,000 --> 04:49:14,260
You don't believe me.

5778
04:49:14,900 --> 04:49:15,660
Not a word.

5779
04:49:16,180 --> 04:49:18,320
Thank you very much, Miss Incredulous.

5780
04:49:21,240 --> 04:49:22,780
Hey, who are those guys?

5781
04:49:23,200 --> 04:49:24,580
Must be an improvised patrol.

5782
04:49:24,780 --> 04:49:25,100
Oh no.

5783
04:49:25,260 --> 04:49:27,480
Don't say a word if they don't ask you anything.

5784
04:49:27,760 --> 04:49:28,020
Oh no.

5785
04:49:28,020 --> 04:49:29,400
The smuggling.

5786
04:49:29,680 --> 04:49:30,600
Oh my god, smuggling.

5787
04:49:30,640 --> 04:49:30,960
Smuggling.

5788
04:49:31,040 --> 04:49:31,480
We're smuggling.

5789
04:49:31,600 --> 04:49:31,920
We're smuggling.

5790
04:49:32,480 --> 04:49:33,120
Uh-oh.

5791
04:49:33,360 --> 04:49:33,980
Good morning.

5792
04:49:34,300 --> 04:49:35,900
May I see your passports, please?

5793
04:49:36,120 --> 04:49:36,600
Mike!

5794
04:49:36,820 --> 04:49:37,740
Here you are.

5795
04:49:40,000 --> 04:49:40,680
Very well.

5796
04:49:40,800 --> 04:49:41,220
Let's see.

5797
04:49:41,940 --> 04:49:42,420
Fuck.

5798
04:49:43,680 --> 04:49:45,040
You're Jessie Fox.

5799
04:49:45,400 --> 04:49:45,760
Yeah.

5800
04:49:46,520 --> 04:49:47,640
Yeah, that's me.

5801
04:49:48,180 --> 04:49:48,980
Holy Jesus.

5802
04:49:49,160 --> 04:49:50,180
I can't believe it.

5803
04:49:50,200 --> 04:49:50,640
The legend.

5804
04:49:50,860 --> 04:49:51,280
Hey, Jimmy.

5805
04:49:51,740 --> 04:49:52,220
Jimmy?

5806
04:49:52,720 --> 04:49:52,860
Who's that guy?

5807
04:49:53,580 --> 04:49:54,480
That's not a Jimmy.

5808
04:49:54,560 --> 04:49:55,000
I'm Mikey's Fox.

5809
04:49:55,280 --> 04:49:55,540
Oh.

5810
04:49:55,540 --> 04:50:00,040
The one who rescued Colonel Alan Harris and prevented the nuclear attacks.

5811
04:50:01,440 --> 04:50:03,960
I really admire you, Mr. Fox.

5812
04:50:04,220 --> 04:50:05,520
You're a fucking hero.

5813
04:50:05,840 --> 04:50:06,540
Thanks, soldier.

5814
04:50:06,900 --> 04:50:08,000
Here are your passports.

5815
04:50:08,320 --> 04:50:09,140
Thank you.

5816
04:50:10,300 --> 04:50:11,360
It's Mike.

5817
04:50:11,440 --> 04:50:11,840
Drive carefully.

5818
04:50:12,680 --> 04:50:13,580
Hey, Mike.

5819
04:50:17,580 --> 04:50:19,020
Are you okay?

5820
04:50:19,340 --> 04:50:20,680
You've been very quiet.

5821
04:50:22,120 --> 04:50:23,060
Stop the car.

5822
04:50:26,800 --> 04:50:29,400
Oh, maybe not on like the side of the cliff, right?

5823
04:50:31,540 --> 04:50:32,260
What's up?

5824
04:50:33,820 --> 04:50:35,100
Then it's true.

5825
04:50:35,280 --> 04:50:36,460
Jessie paid them off.

5826
04:50:37,100 --> 04:50:37,180
It's all true.

5827
04:50:37,180 --> 04:50:38,240
Now do you believe me?

5828
04:50:38,420 --> 04:50:39,120
Kiss me.

5829
04:50:39,560 --> 04:50:40,080
What?

5830
04:50:40,580 --> 04:50:40,920
What?

5831
04:50:41,120 --> 04:50:42,040
Kiss me now.

5832
04:50:42,540 --> 04:50:43,060
Huh?

5833
04:50:53,720 --> 04:50:54,240
What?

5834
04:50:56,460 --> 04:50:59,660
She was turned on by the... by the heroism?

5835
04:51:16,550 --> 04:51:18,430
That's how you guys gotta get...

5836
04:51:18,430 --> 04:51:21,950
If you want the girl, that's what you gotta do.

5837
04:51:22,650 --> 04:51:24,690
You gotta become a smuggler.

5838
04:51:25,270 --> 04:51:27,610
You gotta go to the forest.

5839
04:51:27,990 --> 04:51:31,850
You gotta get caught by some guards.

5840
04:51:32,210 --> 04:51:34,330
And they imprison you for a crime you didn't commit.

5841
04:51:34,710 --> 04:51:35,770
What was the crime?

5842
04:51:37,990 --> 04:51:40,450
And then you also...

5843
04:51:40,450 --> 04:51:40,970
Um, okay.

5844
04:51:41,870 --> 04:51:45,710
Part of me was starting to believe that the girl in the seat was his sister.

5845
04:51:46,710 --> 04:51:47,270
So...

5846
04:51:47,270 --> 04:51:50,550
I'm glad that wasn't the case when we...

5847
04:51:51,230 --> 04:51:53,490
When she said kiss me.

5848
04:51:54,250 --> 04:51:55,050
Unless...

5849
04:52:00,450 --> 04:52:01,250
Unless...

5850
04:52:03,350 --> 04:52:06,830
Don't be so selfish...

5851
04:52:10,030 --> 04:52:10,830
Nanananananananananana...

5852
04:52:10,830 --> 04:52:11,510
Nanananananananana...

5853
04:52:19,870 --> 04:52:20,670
Nanananananananana...

5854
04:52:20,870 --> 04:52:20,990
Hanaka.

5855
04:52:21,670 --> 04:52:22,490
You know...

5856
04:52:22,490 --> 04:52:22,950
But you would.

5857
04:52:22,950 --> 04:52:23,250
It's Thank You, She 충ered me.

5858
04:52:23,250 --> 04:52:24,930
Sweet Hope Alabama but for Anime.

5859
04:52:28,430 --> 04:52:31,490
That's all you gotta do!

5860
04:52:31,770 --> 04:52:37,930
And then you stop the plans... Whatever plans they have going.

5861
04:52:38,390 --> 04:52:43,810
It can be... It could be they're learning how to clone...

5862
04:52:43,810 --> 04:52:47,990
And... ultra mega dogs... for fighting.

5863
04:52:48,510 --> 04:52:49,550
You just gotta stop.

5864
04:52:49,690 --> 04:52:52,170
Or it could be that they're trying to find the most...

5865
04:52:52,170 --> 04:52:54,130
They're trying to harvest the most delicious potato.

5866
04:52:54,550 --> 04:52:55,430
It doesn't matter.

5867
04:52:56,650 --> 04:52:58,350
You stop their plan.

5868
04:53:00,770 --> 04:53:02,570
Then, you earn a reward.

5869
04:53:03,050 --> 04:53:04,710
And then, you get the girl.

5870
04:53:11,870 --> 04:53:12,930
And that's it!

5871
04:53:13,810 --> 04:53:14,190
Yippee!

5872
04:53:15,430 --> 04:53:17,750
Overall, I really did like the game.

5873
04:53:19,510 --> 04:53:20,630
You know...

5874
04:53:20,630 --> 04:53:24,870
While the final boss was... a little BS...

5875
04:53:24,870 --> 04:53:27,530
Once you learn the...

5876
04:53:29,030 --> 04:53:33,070
Once you learn the... what you have to do...

5877
04:53:33,810 --> 04:53:34,410
Then...

5878
04:53:35,350 --> 04:53:38,770
The game wants you to play a very specific way.

5879
04:53:38,910 --> 04:53:40,070
And that's okay, you know.

5880
04:53:40,890 --> 04:53:41,570
But...

5881
04:53:42,630 --> 04:53:43,030
Hmm...

5882
04:53:43,030 --> 04:53:44,110
Thank you for playing.

5883
04:53:44,630 --> 04:53:47,390
Oh, thanks... Special thanks to you for playing on Metal.

5884
04:53:48,170 --> 04:53:48,570
Thanks!

5885
04:53:50,630 --> 04:53:51,470
Hey, Jimmy.

5886
04:53:51,890 --> 04:53:54,050
Who the fuck is this Colonel Alan Harris?

5887
04:53:54,510 --> 04:53:55,190
I don't know.

5888
04:53:56,130 --> 04:53:57,750
Yesterday, I met that guy in a bar.

5889
04:53:57,990 --> 04:53:58,710
He was nice.

5890
04:53:59,030 --> 04:54:01,790
I told him that I was going to slog as a guard here today.

5891
04:54:02,070 --> 04:54:02,470
Slog.

5892
04:54:02,470 --> 04:54:05,170
And he said if I pretended he rescued the Colonel...

5893
04:54:05,170 --> 04:54:07,770
And prevented nuclear attacks when he drove by...

5894
04:54:07,770 --> 04:54:09,290
He'd give me a hundred bucks.

5895
04:54:09,490 --> 04:54:11,430
A hundred bucks for saying four sentences.

5896
04:54:11,570 --> 04:54:12,490
Can you believe it?

5897
04:54:12,550 --> 04:54:13,210
No way.

5898
04:54:13,450 --> 04:54:14,910
Good morning.

5899
04:54:15,090 --> 04:54:16,350
Can I see your passport, please?

5900
04:54:16,350 --> 04:54:17,350
He did pay them off.

5901
04:54:17,690 --> 04:54:18,170
Good morning.

5902
04:54:18,170 --> 04:54:18,730
Here you are.

5903
04:54:18,730 --> 04:54:19,230
It's all...

5904
04:54:20,010 --> 04:54:20,830
It's a lie?

5905
04:54:23,350 --> 04:54:25,910
It's been the easiest one hundred bucks ever.

5906
04:54:26,330 --> 04:54:26,570
Fuck.

5907
04:54:26,930 --> 04:54:29,850
People make up stupid shit just to score.

5908
04:54:30,110 --> 04:54:30,790
Yeah, dude.

5909
04:54:46,920 --> 04:54:47,860
No way.

5910
04:54:48,240 --> 04:54:49,800
Jesse Fox, I believed you.

5911
04:54:56,700 --> 04:54:58,560
Jesse Fox, I believed you.

5912
04:55:03,720 --> 04:55:08,440
He's not only a smuggler of goods, he's a smuggler of knowledge.

5913
04:55:10,160 --> 04:55:12,260
He smuggled that... and money.

5914
04:55:12,720 --> 04:55:16,900
He smuggled it to the guy and then he smuggled the story to the girl.

5915
04:55:17,340 --> 04:55:18,480
Into her brain.

5916
04:55:21,060 --> 04:55:21,700
Scammed.

5917
04:55:22,660 --> 04:55:23,940
Knowledge smuggler.

5918
04:55:25,040 --> 04:55:26,260
We've been swindled.

5919
04:55:26,480 --> 04:55:27,700
We've been hoodwinked.

5920
04:55:28,220 --> 04:55:30,100
We've been scammed, bamboozled.

5921
04:55:30,760 --> 04:55:32,340
I think I need to take notes.

5922
04:55:34,080 --> 04:55:34,800
I think.

5923
04:55:36,360 --> 04:55:37,940
I think I need to take notes.

5924
04:55:39,860 --> 04:55:41,220
That's what they want us to believe.

5925
04:55:43,880 --> 04:55:45,980
So you're gonna make it to your plans, boss?

5926
04:55:47,240 --> 04:55:49,160
If I leave, like, right now.

5927
04:55:49,980 --> 04:55:50,380
Maybe.

5928
04:55:50,760 --> 04:55:53,300
If I get ready and leave right at this very moment.

5929
04:55:53,300 --> 04:55:54,060
Thank you guys!

5930
04:55:54,320 --> 04:55:56,180
For letting me finish UnMetal!

5931
04:55:56,420 --> 04:55:58,920
I did not think that it would take another five hours.

5932
04:55:59,360 --> 04:56:00,980
Something, something, skill issues.

5933
04:56:03,180 --> 04:56:03,700
Anyway!

5934
04:56:06,340 --> 04:56:07,380
Thank you!

5935
04:56:08,420 --> 04:56:10,700
I only have a little bit of time left in Japan.

5936
04:56:11,340 --> 04:56:13,240
Probably, I will stream.

5937
04:56:15,060 --> 04:56:17,940
Probably come back next, either Tuesday or Wednesday.

5938
04:56:18,340 --> 04:56:21,120
I will, of course, let you guys know on Twitter.

5939
04:56:21,280 --> 04:56:23,000
And in a schedule.

5940
04:56:23,300 --> 04:56:26,920
When I create my schedule for this coming week.

5941
04:56:27,320 --> 04:56:28,140
Yes, yes, yes.

5942
04:56:28,380 --> 04:56:28,740
Okay!

5943
04:56:28,920 --> 04:56:30,440
Thank you!

5944
04:56:30,560 --> 04:56:31,120
Bye bye!

5945
04:56:31,400 --> 04:56:33,540
I'll see you guys when I get back home!

5946
04:56:34,160 --> 04:56:34,600
Bye!

5947
04:56:34,900 --> 04:56:35,520
Bye bye!

5948
04:56:38,500 --> 04:56:39,460
Just a couple days.

5949
04:56:39,540 --> 04:56:39,980
Just a couple days.

5950
04:56:40,260 --> 04:56:40,540
Bye!
