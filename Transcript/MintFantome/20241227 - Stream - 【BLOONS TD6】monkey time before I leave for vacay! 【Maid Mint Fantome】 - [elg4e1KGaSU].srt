1
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,750
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b...

2
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,460
I'm

3
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,280
currently drinking coffee.

4
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,320
Hopefully, it will rejuvenate me.

5
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:07,680
I actually just got back from doing many haunting errands.

6
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,900
So I just got back home like an hour ago.

7
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,360
And so...

8
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,560
And boy are my arms tired.

9
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,320
But I was seriously like...

10
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,780
I'm gonna sleep now.

11
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,060
I'm gonna eat now.

12
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,360
Get shorter sleeves.

13
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:33,680
No!

14
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,200
I like my sleeves.

15
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,300
They help with...

16
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,680
With...

17
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,500
Cleaning up messes.

18
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,500
Those sleeves do look heavy.

19
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,220
Ma'am, your sleeves look heavy.

20
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,640
Can I please help you with your...

21
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,100
Sleeves?

22
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,200
Why are her ears like that?

23
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,820
What do you mean?

24
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,100
What do you mean?

25
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,200
Bet Mint wipes boogers with her sleeves.

26
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:17,860
No!

27
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,600
Is that why they're green?

28
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,940
Ew, that's gross.

29
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,360
Why would you say that?

30
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,240
That's so nasty.

31
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,800
God.

32
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,920
Why did my chat break already?

33
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,120
Come on, YouTube.

34
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,280
YouTube!

35
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,120
But anyway, today I was like...

36
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,610
Well, rather...

37
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,180
Tomorrow, I am...

38
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,280
I'm going to be going on vacation for a little bit.

39
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,040
And...

40
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,600
And...

41
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,630
I was like, what's something that I can do...

42
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,380
That's kind of chill?

43
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,580
Something I haven't done in a long while.

44
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,000
And that's balloons!

45
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,140
We're returning to monkey.

46
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,480
My true form.

47
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,840
Minky.

48
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,520
What is this AI shit?

49
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,300
Oh no.

50
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,630
All I saw was the auto-generated...

51
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,870
Chat thing was that...

52
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,810
People are...

53
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,100
They said it was like...

54
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,710
Viewers are concerned about her...

55
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,840
Health habits.

56
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,620
I got my happy coat today.

57
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,480
The graphic is so sleek and shiny.

58
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,620
I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and have a wonderful Japan trip.

59
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,900
Thanks Joshua!

60
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,220
Oh my gosh, I'm glad you got it.

61
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,480
It's so soft, isn't it?

62
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,020
It's so nice.

63
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,140
I'm glad it arrived safely.

64
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,040
I...

65
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,860
I don't remember what I was going to say.

66
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,660
I'm so...

67
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,220
I'm so brain dead.

68
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,440
I mean, my brain is always dead.

69
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,340
Because I'm dead.

70
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,740
But you know what I mean.

71
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,920
I...

72
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,150
I can barely think.

73
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,600
Because I'm a monkey.

74
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,340
Honestly, I'm not packed at all.

75
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,300
I went...

76
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,760
And then...

77
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,340
My mom was just like...

78
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,820
Oh, by the way, we're meeting today, right?

79
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,080
I was like, what do you mean?

80
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,780
Monkey bunny!

81
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,520
So I was at my mom's place for a bit.

82
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,750
You forgot?

83
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,770
No, no, no.

84
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,430
No, no, no.

85
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,110
This was the other day.

86
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,350
After... So basically...

87
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,250
I asked my mom about it today.

88
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,290
I was just like, hey, you said you were going to be gone for Christmas.

89
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,250
And so that we weren't going to have a Christmas.

90
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,050
And that's why we celebrated Christmas early this year.

91
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,230
And she's like, no.

92
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,250
Your sister is not going to be here for Christmas.

93
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,590
And I was gone last week.

94
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,090
So that's why we did it early.

95
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,250
And I was like...

96
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,330
Min, watch out.

97
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,170
There's a camel bloom behind you.

98
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,170
Well, good thing I have...

99
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,170
The camo.

100
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,710
I have the thermal goggles.

101
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,180
That's the sound of me throwing darts.

102
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,410
And blowing up the balloons.

103
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,650
Speaking of which, I went to check my YouTube today.

104
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,770
And one of the ideas for the inspiration section was...

105
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,670
Min goes on a virtual vacation with her friends.

106
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,360
Why would I suggest that?

107
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,420
Let's see what my... OK, hold on.

108
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,340
So if you don't know, YouTube has this new fancy feature.

109
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,160
Where it gives you ideas.

110
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,120
If you're like, I don't know what kind of...

111
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,140
It's called the inspiration tab.

112
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,280
And if you're like, I don't know what kind of video to make.

113
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,400
There's the inspiration tab, which is...

114
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,540
Which brainstorms for you.

115
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,940
And it's all AI.

116
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,380
Ideas.

117
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,400
Huh?

118
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,260
OK,

119
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,850
so here's my first one.

120
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,710
That I came up with.

121
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,170
Aoi-chan tries to sing high notes.

122
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,430
I think my channel is being taken over.

123
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,850
Aoi-chan's vocal range...

124
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,530
Why is it called Aoi-chan?

125
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,470
No, I'm mint, I'm not blue.

126
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,470
Who is Aoi-chan?

127
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,730
I don't know.

128
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,450
The next one.

129
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,870
The video captures Aoi-chan's reactions to the song.

130
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,070
Providing a humorous end.

131
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,450
And it cuts off there.

132
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,010
Mint-chan!

133
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,230
The next one is, VTuber sings popular songs in different genres.

134
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,150
Popular songs are sung by a VTuber in a variety of musical genres.

135
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:00,490
Listen as VTuber's distinct vocal style is showcased across different styles of music.

136
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,030
These ones are also boring today.

137
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,630
And then this one.

138
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,270
This one is so messed up.

139
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,650
VTuber tries a voice changing app.

140
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:15,370
I already get... I already get accused of using a voice changer all the time.

141
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,150
Well, maybe that's an exaggeration.

142
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,710
But, people are like, hi.

143
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,750
That's probably some guy.

144
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,910
It's getting Aoi-chan from your song cover 3 years ago.

145
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,650
I figured it was the...

146
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,470
Aoi-chan...

147
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,950
Chocomint Ice Ice Ice.

148
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,910
I can't remember the full title.

149
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,250
But you already do use one.

150
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,450
I do.

151
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,890
You guys wanna hear my real voice?

152
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,310
That's my real voice.

153
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,400
My favorite streamers in this channel, in order.

154
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,100
1 Lilac, 2 Aoi-chan, 3 Minto.

155
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,980
You forgot Mint-chan.

156
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Voice mod stream.

157
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,800
A VTuber's voice is altered in unexpected ways by a voice changing app.

158
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,440
The results are hilarious and demonstrate the app's capabilities.

159
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,540
These suck.

160
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,120
Sometimes they're really wacky for me.

161
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,600
Oh yeah, the ghost that's haunting me, alright.

162
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,500
That's the ghost that's haunting me, alright.

163
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,860
It's so funny because I don't think it draws any ideas from my live streams.

164
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,900
It only draws ideas from my actual videos.

165
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,420
Which is very bizarre.

166
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:10,280
I guess YouTube doesn't consider live streams as important as normal videos.

167
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,500
It's strange.

168
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,180
Strange.

169
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,900
It'll always give me something about Shubidubi or like...

170
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:31,140
It'll be like, VTuber goes pop, pop, pop, pop in higher voices.

171
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:40,220
One of mine was Mint's biggest gaming fails and said this chaotic compilation will leave viewers laughing at Mint's hilarious misfortunes.

172
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,140
That's so mean.

173
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,860
Hi Minto, first time sending a superchat.

174
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,780
Thank you, Jacob!

175
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,520
Happy to be spending my birthday here watching the chill balloon stream.

176
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,520
You know what time it is.

177
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,160
Happy birthday to you.

178
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,480
Happy birthday to you.

179
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,640
Happy birthday dear Jacob.

180
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
With an R!

181
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,900
Happy birthday to you.

182
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
Happy birthday!

183
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,720
Thank you so much for the first superchat.

184
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,760
I'm honored.

185
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,680
Guys, it's been a long time since I've played balloons, I'll be honest.

186
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:35,340
It's been a hot minute since I've lived the monkey life.

187
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,400
Mermonkey?

188
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,340
3 million balloons!

189
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,380
Get the most bottle.

190
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,800
I want to get the Mermonkey!

191
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,560
Okay guys, that's our goal today is to get the Mermonkey with 3 million balloons.

192
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,860
There's new ones!

193
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,840
This one's tricky.

194
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,760
Bonus reward.

195
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,860
Whatever this means.

196
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,040
Create two more maps to unlock all extra maps.

197
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,760
Should we try it?

198
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,640
The Luminous Cove?

199
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,960
My

200
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,360
coffee is strange.

201
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,540
It's actually my Kojima Productions coffee.

202
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,400
Boat time.

203
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,540
We need a boat in this.

204
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,260
I guess let's try medium.

205
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,280
We need to pop 3 million.

206
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,360
Why are there gingerbread...

207
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,840
This is so beautiful.

208
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,540
What is the path?

209
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,920
So they come down and then they go...

210
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,300
And then maybe they go...

211
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,380
But what about here?

212
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,100
Then here too?

213
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,260
Maybe they come down both sides?

214
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,160
And then they cross and sometimes they exit this way and sometimes they exit this way.

215
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,460
Love this game.

216
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,840
BTG6 was addicted...

217
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,840
Oh, was addicted to...

218
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,960
For 3 months straight.

219
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,520
Yeah, it sounds about me too.

220
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,060
Time to go bananas.

221
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Bananas!

222
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
It looks like a uterus.

223
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,000
The map shape looks sus.

224
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,860
Stop you guys!

225
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,720
This map layout is sus.

226
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Stop!

227
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,420
No, it's mysterious.

228
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,900
Look there's...

229
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,380
The merpeople!

230
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,900
The mermonkeys!

231
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,450
I can't unsee it now.

232
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,890
You guys have ruined it!

233
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,390
With your perverted mind!

234
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,090
Death penalty!

235
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,720
Not the balloon womb.

236
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,140
No!

237
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,600
Let's see.

238
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,940
Where can we even put her?

239
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,280
I don't know where to put her.

240
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,800
We're gonna do sub-optimal balloons today.

241
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,160
I'm so sorry everybody.

242
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,820
For my sub-optimal balloons positioning.

243
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,260
I apologize.

244
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,720
I apologize.

245
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,500
The bloom!

246
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,310
Where's Ice Monkey?

247
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,130
Right here!

248
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,090
Right here!

249
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,750
Oh, sorry.

250
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,930
I'm kinda blocking, huh?

251
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,790
There's never a good place for me to go in the balloon streams.

252
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,710
Yeah, I'll just be tall.

253
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,830
I'll be skinny legend.

254
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:27,730
Is that okay?

255
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,330
Like this?

256
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,910
I'm like standing right next to you.

257
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,510
Mint, will you be going pro in balloons?

258
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,050
Talk to my agent, thank you.

259
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,270
We're going back to the bloom.

260
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:43,590
No!

261
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,830
No!

262
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,210
No!

263
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,420
Okay.

264
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm gonna put Ice... No.

265
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,620
We're gonna start out proper with a boat.

266
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,170
There they go.

267
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,530
Here they come in.

268
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,910
Nice.

269
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,490
Chat is taller than Minto.

270
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,570
I could be taller.

271
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,410
Actually, I have a banana which makes me taller.

272
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,390
I got an Indiana Jones hat for Christmas because chat told me to.

273
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,930
I gotta say I'm 15% cooler with it on.

274
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,310
I wanna play Indiana Jones so bad.

275
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,610
I wanna play Indiana Jones so bad.

276
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,510
Okay, now we get to see where they come... where they go.

277
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,130
Oh, see?

278
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,830
Yeah, we knew.

279
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,950
It's exactly what I predicted.

280
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,690
They'll come from the left side and then they'll come from the right side.

281
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,730
Okay, now we know.

282
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,430
Time to get another boat.

283
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,230
Actually, let's just line this whole area with boats.

284
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,910
Now we wait.

285
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,150
Nice.

286
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,630
Again.

287
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,190
Again!

288
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,490
Again!

289
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,730
Oh, that's a lot of blue.

290
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:22,770
That's okay.

291
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,750
Our boats are powerful.

292
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,930
Our boats are strong.

293
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,910
We should do... I still have yet to unlock this.

294
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,530
Maybe... I don't think we'll get it today, obviously, but maybe someday.

295
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,450
Let's do...

296
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,230
Honestly, I'm so slow-brained today.

297
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,490
I'm just like... I just wanna listen to the popping of the balloon.

298
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,730
The balloon popping.

299
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,010
Banana soupa.

300
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,870
Move over to center and he can be part of the cave art.

301
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,690
No!

302
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,610
You would want that, huh?

303
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,570
You would want me in this freakish... here, huh?

304
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:21,840
Nice.

305
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,800
Don't be... Actually, I was gonna say don't be freaks, but...

306
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,920
That's like our whole shtick.

307
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,320
That's like our whole thing.

308
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,600
You guys...

309
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,560
You guys, actually today...

310
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,060
Toho Lost Word will be doing a live stream in about like 40 minutes.

311
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,880
And there might be people that come here that don't know me at all and they're just like...

312
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,240
Oh, I'm curious about who this mint phantom fella... fella is.

313
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,480
I'm gonna go check her out and see what's going on.

314
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,600
And then they'll see us talking about the womb and that's...

315
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,080
That's gonna be weird!

316
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,480
I'm in the 23rd time sending a super chat, I think.

317
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,620
And one to tell you that your Santa baby cover got so many people pregnant.

318
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,340
No!

319
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,680
I'm not ready.

320
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,940
I'm not... I'm only... I'm only forever 19.

321
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,300
I'm not ready for this responsibility!

322
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,940
Thank you!

323
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,940
Of course you can!

324
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,460
But how I...

325
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,400
Do I have to say your whole legal name?

326
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,040
Happy... Wait.

327
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:21,840
Sorry.

328
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:32,440
I don't know if there's any...

329
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,720
Alright.

330
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,860
We're still popping?

331
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,360
We're still popping?

332
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,760
Merry Chrysler!

333
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,560
Merry Chrysler!

334
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,460
My... I got a Christmas gift from my mom today.

335
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,120
And you know what she gifted me?

336
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,380
She gifted me...

337
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,480
No!

338
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,720
Not a hot dog!

339
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,520
Not a hot dog!

340
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,300
That would be weird.

341
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,300
No, actually I got...

342
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,300
She gifted me, like, spatulas and stuff.

343
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,680
Utensils for the kitchen, but they're mint colored!

344
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,080
They're so cute!

345
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,140
Having been a Touhou fan for a very long time, I think most of us are already a little freaky.

346
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,760
I think actually Touhou... Becoming a Touhou fan was the start of my freakness.

347
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,440
And I mean that in 100% sincerity.

348
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:47,980
Touhou...

349
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:54,280
Touhou had some of the freakiest stuff going on.

350
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,920
I think.

351
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,740
I truly think it was...

352
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,320
It was that.

353
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,720
But also I consider Touhou being like...

354
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,580
How do I say?

355
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,920
Here, let's do some...

356
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,740
We'll do you as a carrier and you in the middle.

357
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,380
Or wait, let's get one more guy.

358
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,780
Smack dab there.

359
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,200
Oh, well, that's fine.

360
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,340
I'm a little figment of the imagination.

361
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,220
Weird how you should be paying as child support.

362
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:41,560
No!

363
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,450
Touhou is so innocent but leads to many awakenings.

364
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,250
Yes.

365
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,230
You guys, act a little bit normal.

366
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,090
We can scare...

367
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,770
We can... Well, maybe they are Touhou fans.

368
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,590
If they are Touhou fans, they gotta be a little freaky too.

369
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,150
Probably.

370
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,190
I think.

371
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,960
This guy will be...

372
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,320
The pirate lord.

373
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,860
And then this guy will be...

374
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,720
This one.

375
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,800
Alright, chat set freakers to 50%.

376
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,160
As if we can just turn it off.

377
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,460
How do you turn off the freak?

378
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,840
They are coming to Mint's dream.

379
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,600
They should know better.

380
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,240
No!

381
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:06,800
No!

382
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,900
How would they know?

383
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,620
How would they know?

384
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,740
How would they know?

385
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,370
Wait, my Freak-O-Meter only goes down to 75.

386
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,650
I guess that's it then.

387
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,910
I guess that's it then.

388
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,750
Crank up the Freak-O-Meter.

389
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,970
We're cranking it up.

390
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,050
We're cranking it up.

391
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,690
Which one?

392
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:39,010
It's the submarine that has... We'll probably need him for the intel, right?

393
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,230
I imagine.

394
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,570
So we're gonna get this guy in here.

395
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,630
We're gonna have him be able to contact all other boats.

396
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,990
Touhou fans will see Mint and go...

397
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,500
Long range.

398
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,960
This one.

399
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,120
The submerge.

400
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,220
Yeah, we'll just go with this.

401
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,020
Into the middle.

402
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,220
We'll put him like... Wait, if I put him there, would another boat be able to fit here?

403
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,420
Probably not, right?

404
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,760
Pools on subs.

405
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,020
You won't... Wait, what do you mean?

406
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,300
Pools on subs?

407
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,720
Pools?

408
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:27,760
Pools.

409
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,760
Personally, I'm quite fond of Koishi just in case my last Super Chat was lost on it.

410
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,820
Thank you.

411
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,710
The top corners.

412
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,950
Top pools on subs.

413
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,890
So we put the subs in here.

414
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,250
Up here?

415
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,550
The ovary pools.

416
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,950
If these are the ovaries, then what are these?

417
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,670
Like an ovarian cyst?

418
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,900
The ovaries too?

419
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,900
The backups?

420
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,610
The balls.

421
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:23,990
The sequel.

422
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,390
Fertilized eggs.

423
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,690
That's not where they go.

424
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,290
Open the skulls!

425
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,550
Are you a big hat or a big bow kind of person?

426
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,690
I love both, but personally I'm a big hat believer, baby.

427
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,230
BabyCorn, thanks for the gifted.

428
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,910
I meant that my birthday is on the 30th.

429
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,070
As you are to leave, could I please have a personalized happy birthday?

430
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:54,470
I know I already thanked you for the generalize one yesterday, but I'm greedy.

431
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,330
Yeah!

432
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,610
Happy birthday to you!

433
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,670
Happy birthday to you!

434
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,610
Happy birthday Viridian Delta!

435
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:12,230
Happy birthday to you!

436
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,250
Happy birthday!

437
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,050
My first exposure to Touhou was the Ronald McDonald mashup.

438
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,490
This is it!

439
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:21,850
This is it!

440
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,310
This is it!

441
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,350
I just woke up and I see Minto legs.

442
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,410
Am I still dreaming?

443
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,510
Get out of here.

444
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,090
Go back to sleep.

445
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,870
Also, I'm sorry your mom didn't get you a hotdog.

446
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:37,670
Here's one on me.

447
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,890
I don't want a hotdog.

448
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,840
Wouldn't the bloons be eggs in the bloom?

449
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,350
Or is it something else?

450
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,510
I really don't like this level anymore.

451
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,110
I don't think I like this level anymore.

452
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,660
Okay, we're saving up.

453
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,340
Cannon.

454
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,300
Saving up.

455
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,560
What's this?

456
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,000
Nice.

457
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,440
I think you need more monkey.

458
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,020
No, not yet.

459
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,080
Not yet.

460
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,760
Look at our guys.

461
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,600
They're so powerful.

462
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:29,720
I'm Minto.

463
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,840
I'm also on December 30th birthday ever.

464
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,020
How do you guys feel about having a birthday that is...

465
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,300
That is so close to... How is it that...

466
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,440
If you were born...

467
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,940
Wait, that's the 30th, not the 31st.

468
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,900
Just B-E-C-I.

469
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,980
Happy birthday to you.

470
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,860
Happy birthday to you.

471
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,380
Happy birthday just B-C-E-R.

472
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,380
Wait, B-E-C-R.

473
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,740
Happy birthday to you.

474
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,900
Spooky echo.

475
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,060
Spooky.

476
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,740
Wait.

477
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
He can shoot them!

478
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,000
Oh my god!

479
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,560
He can hit the camos!

480
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,900
We have... We have a guy.

481
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,280
Let's get this guy in.

482
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,740
I'm going to sandwich him right here.

483
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,220
We can put guys on either side of him.

484
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,940
There we go.

485
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,400
Okay.

486
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:49,610
As a 23rd of December birthday haver, it might as well be the same day.

487
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,510
Wait, same day as what?

488
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,620
I love how everybody is coming out being like, oh by the way, my birthday too!

489
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:11,280
I can't sing happy birthday for everybody, but...

490
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,720
Beep-beep, happy birthday!

491
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:19,860
I did do the generalized birthday you guys, so that you know if I miss any birthdays while I'm gone.

492
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,420
Camo.

493
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,840
What do you mean camo?

494
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,560
Oh my gosh, Kudo is so cute.

495
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,600
I love... She's so cute.

496
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,540
Chat is greedy.

497
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,420
What did you expect?

498
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,100
You know what?

499
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,860
I am too, so...

500
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,020
Maybe chat really does reflect the streamer, huh?

501
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,240
Happy birthday to you!

502
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,000
Happy birthday to you!

503
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,820
Happy birthday dear Beep-Beeps!

504
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,080
Happy birthday to you!

505
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:04,260
Are all the maps designed to look like organs?

506
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,680
Possibly.

507
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,500
I want to get this destroyer.

508
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,240
Submerge.

509
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,440
Actually, sorry, I spent all my money.

510
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,400
This year was a mixed bag, but deciding to watch Mervinto was a silver lining.

511
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,480
Thanks Jordan!

512
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,820
Safe travels, I appreciate it.

513
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,520
So much, thank you.

514
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,930
How many balloons have we popped so far, I wonder?

515
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,390
My birthday is on the 31st too.

516
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,490
What do you mean two?

517
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,250
Everybody else said the 30th.

518
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:10,350
Though the calendar does not mark this day as the anniversary of my birth, may I with deepest humility and utmost reverence and...

519
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,450
What are you talking about?

520
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,390
It is not your birthday.

521
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,890
Then why am I singing a birthday song?

522
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,750
Get in line.

523
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,610
You need like 150 plus run to get to 3 mil.

524
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,190
Dang!

525
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,350
Okay, we can get there though today, I think.

526
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,430
Maybe.

527
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:56,350
Okay, maybe it's time to start also investing in money.

528
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,150
There's so many things to worry about, I'm just a monkey.

529
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,490
I'm just a monkey, there's too many things to worry about in this monkey world.

530
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,690
There's too many things to be on my little monkey mind.

531
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,270
Happy birthday to you.

532
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,490
Happy birthday to you.

533
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,090
Happy birthday, Samoponume.

534
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,850
Happy birthday to you.

535
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:28,530
Look, you guys, the mermaid monkey is right here.

536
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,710
We have to unlock him.

537
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,270
We have to get there.

538
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,050
Nice.

539
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,990
Nice.

540
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,990
Nice.

541
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,910
Mermaid monkey.

542
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,180
Where can I even put...

543
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,400
Where can I even put... I guess like...

544
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,120
Down here.

545
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,720
I can fit maybe...

546
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,300
One?

547
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,900
I think I can only fit one.

548
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,780
Bottom path.

549
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,340
Yeah, I'm working on it with this guy.

550
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,860
Actually, you know what, let's just upgrade him.

551
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,280
Right now.

552
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,000
This map feels bad.

553
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,940
It's called a challenge.

554
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,260
It's called a challenge.

555
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,680
The maps get pretty tricky though, right?

556
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,300
Just more merchant boats.

557
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,900
I think we'll do that, probably.

558
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,880
More merchants.

559
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,180
But for now, I think it's good to also upgrade so that we can...

560
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,400
So that we can...

561
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,700
This guy shows the camels, right?

562
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

563
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,700
So maybe we'll do this.

564
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,360
Hot shot.

565
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,550
It's not my birthday, but I'm leaving for a vacation to Sweden on Sunday.

566
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,710
Ice skating on the Baltic Sea.

567
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,550
Wow!

568
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,950
Have fun, Senshi.

569
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,830
Oh my god.

570
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,510
That sounds amazing.

571
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,610
Plus 200!

572
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,350
Oh my gosh!

573
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:17,910
It's a MOAB!

574
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,450
Easy.

575
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,410
We're so good at this game.

576
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,110
Handle it.

577
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:36,970
MOAB.

578
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,090
Handle it.

579
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,590
I wanna put her in somewhere.

580
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,490
Put her in coach.

581
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,570
Maybe she can just like chill at the end.

582
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,230
Actually, isn't she really great at the beginning?

583
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,870
But we can't put her in the beginning.

584
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,310
We can put her in the middle.

585
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:54,890
Monkey in the middle.

586
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,930
Feels weird not having someone... She wouldn't even say handle it.

587
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,450
Let's make another boat.

588
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,130
This one will also be...

589
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,530
So this side...

590
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,460
I don't know.

591
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,140
Never mind.

592
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,260
I lied.

593
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:16,980
I don't know anymore.

594
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,660
I know.

595
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,460
This is my favorite Saada skin.

596
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,500
Actually, it's like my favorite... It's like my favorite Minky... Monkey skin.

597
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,460
My favorite monkey skin.

598
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,020
I love to skin the monkeys.

599
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,300
I'm skinning the monkeys.

600
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,380
I'm skinning them.

601
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,660
Minky!

602
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,300
So far, so good though.

603
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,180
So far, this could be way worse.

604
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:53,570
31,000.

605
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,370
Craziness.

606
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,990
We wanna make more money.

607
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,330
I personally like Sushi Ben more, but Saada skin is really good.

608
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,770
I think it's because, you know, it's a spooky ghost.

609
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,810
I'm biased, obviously.

610
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,490
I'm biased, I'm biased, I'm biased.

611
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,570
Like, I admit it.

612
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,790
I admit my, you know, my biases.

613
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,490
It was my birthday earlier this week.

614
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,730
Did I not sing for you?

615
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,170
Why did you tell me?

616
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,490
I was shy.

617
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,890
Shut up!

618
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:36,870
No!

619
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,090
Why were you... What?

620
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:39,590
No!

621
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,470
I was shy.

622
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,500
I can't believe this.

623
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,510
Let's do...

624
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,410
Another round.

625
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,960
Happy birthday to you!

626
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,440
Happy birthday to you!

627
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,640
Happy birthday, Orbital Vagabond!

628
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,200
Happy birthday to you!

629
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,580
I'm just... Here I am.

630
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,980
You guys are just like, sing for me!

631
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,280
Sing for me, Minky!

632
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,000
Sing me happy birthday!

633
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,740
It's my birthday in September.

634
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,420
Do you remember?

635
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,120
Danibus' birthday in September.

636
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,800
Sing it for the next year.

637
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,260
My birthday is in 10 months from now.

638
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,500
Why does this always happen when I go away?

639
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,620
Now... Wait.

640
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,300
No, the carrier flagship, we can put stuff on top, right?

641
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,020
Maybe we can put her on top of the ship.

642
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:56,920
Maybe.

643
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,260
Yeah!

644
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,280
Little planes!

645
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,980
Look at them go!

646
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
Backlogged birthdays.

647
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,200
Crazy, I was crazy once.

648
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,800
Someone said that there was a December version of it.

649
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,640
My birthday is next month.

650
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,060
Will you be there, please?

651
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:20,880
I should!

652
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,100
You mean next year.

653
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,140
I know that it's like...

654
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:32,020
Your birthday is once a year, but it feels different for January.

655
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,720
You have to wait a whole year.

656
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,200
Until your birthday.

657
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,360
I mean, I know everybody has to do that, but I feel like it's...

658
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,100
If my birthday was in January, I feel like I would be like, wow, I have to wait a whole year.

659
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,720
You know?

660
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,500
Like, it has a different feeling than if it's smack in the middle of the year.

661
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,780
Mine's in January?

662
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,580
Brucey, do you feel that way?

663
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,760
Do you feel like, oh my gosh, I have to wait until the new year.

664
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,340
I have no birthday.

665
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,500
That's a lie.

666
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,440
My birthday is the same as the release of the...

667
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,320
Minecraft movie!

668
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,560
I think discovering this cute ghost man was probably one of my highlights of 2034.

669
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,240
Have a good Japan trip and happy new year!

670
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,080
Thank you!

671
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,520
I know everybody has to wait a whole year for their birthday, but it just feels different.

672
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,260
You guys don't understand.

673
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,240
You guys don't... You guys...

674
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:31,680
Come on!

675
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,060
It's different because it's the start of the new year, so you're like, oh my gosh, it must feel different.

676
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:41,900
I feel.

677
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,260
Wait, what did I just do?

678
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,880
Oh, attacks faster and generates more money.

679
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,140
More money.

680
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,460
More money.

681
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:59,580
I have a birthday in January and I don't understand what the hell you mean.

682
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,560
Nobody understands my genius.

683
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,100
Nobody understands my genius.

684
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,440
It's so hard being me.

685
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,340
God!

686
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,000
You say this like you have a January.

687
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,020
No, I'm just saying if I had one, I would probably feel this way.

688
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:25,560
But maybe people who have January birthdays are just like, girl, I don't know what you're talking about.

689
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,180
Maybe it's different.

690
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:29,920
I have no idea.

691
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,020
Wait, what did I...

692
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,100
Monkeys in radius have increased cell value.

693
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,340
Oh my gosh, we're selling off our monkeys.

694
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,640
You also act like I have a birthday.

695
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,540
I have a death day, which I use as a birthday.

696
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:01,490
I understand you.

697
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:02,230
You are correct.

698
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:02,970
Thank you.

699
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:05,150
I think having a birthday on February 29th...

700
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,610
Wait, think of having a birthday...

701
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,850
February 29th, because then you have to wait 4 years for your birthday.

702
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:13,250
And you just don't age.

703
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,190
It's the best thing.

704
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,300
How much money do we make?

705
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,200
Oh, we make an extra thousand.

706
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:31,880
Let's go.

707
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,120
Wait, this guy...

708
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:34,900
Okay.

709
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,160
What do we want to go for?

710
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,000
For the big upgrade.

711
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,620
More money.

712
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,200
More money.

713
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,000
Let's make more minky money guys here.

714
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,620
Merchant man.

715
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,100
More money!

716
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,220
I just wanted to mention it before New Year's.

717
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,780
No worries, since you'll be gone next year busy probably even after.

718
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:15,900
We're not interested.

719
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:16,520
What do you mean?

720
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,500
I wanted to mention Year Walk.

721
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,920
A spooky puzzle game about New Year's.

722
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:22,700
Wait!

723
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,900
I mean I'll be back a little bit after New Year's.

724
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,180
It'll still feel like New Year's maybe.

725
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,980
That's my birthday tomorrow!

726
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,200
Happy birthday to you!

727
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,800
Happy birthday to you!

728
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,900
Happy birthday dear Brian!

729
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,160
With an L.

730
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,480
Happy birthday to you!

731
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,220
Not my birthday.

732
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,020
Luna, thank you so much for the paint!

733
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,180
After watching Vtubers for years, you finally convinced me to start hobby streaming.

734
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,080
Thanks for being you, inspiring everyone to do their best.

735
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:05,720
Good luck!

736
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,540
Down payment for my...

737
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,580
30th birthday next year.

738
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,580
If I don't get a girlfriend by then, could you please summon Lilac to wish me a happy 30th birthday?

739
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:21,020
With her sexy Onee-san voice.

740
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,420
Okay.

741
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:49,980
Sure.

742
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:53,420
Okay.

743
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,920
The fanartist just needed a reference for Minky's.

744
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,720
Just have to put the monkeys and bloons.

745
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,140
But you have to actually try to get a girlfriend, you know?

746
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,880
You can't just half-ass it, I'm telling you.

747
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,580
I'm gonna put this guy in the middle.

748
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,380
Wait, no.

749
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:17,960
Why would I put him in the middle?

750
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,440
Because no bloons come around here.

751
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,080
Okay, hold on.

752
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,120
Wait.

753
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,320
Here.

754
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,040
Here.

755
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,900
Here.

756
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,140
Here.

757
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,140
And this guy is going to become...

758
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,180
A ballistic missile.

759
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,300
Nice.

760
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,340
Wait, what's this one?

761
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:46,870
Longer range.

762
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,600
Nice.

763
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,100
We gonna sabotage you.

764
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,320
Don't say that!

765
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,520
Why would you say that?

766
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,420
Guys is trying to be happy.

767
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,460
Why would you say that?

768
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,560
We did it!

769
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,780
Free play.

770
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,660
Alright, nice.

771
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,820
How much?

772
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,720
Let's see what our...

773
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,620
Wow, we actually got so far.

774
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:32,140
We are almost to this one.

775
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:32,780
For real.

776
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,540
Let's go.

777
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,560
I'm just gonna send him on and maybe...

778
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,330
My birthday was a week ago.

779
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,510
So instead of happy birthday, can I get your best...

780
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:48,830
Like.

781
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,250
Happy birthday.

782
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,930
CC MC Shaggy.

783
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,610
Can I get an...

784
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:00,030
No!

785
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:01,270
No!

786
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:02,030
No!

787
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:02,930
No!

788
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:03,710
No!

789
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:04,970
No!

790
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:06,750
No!

791
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:08,050
No!

792
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:11,510
Actually so good.

793
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:16,410
Last time I did a Shaggy impression, people were like...

794
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:17,150
Wow, man.

795
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,470
That really sucks.

796
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,430
Wow, that was terrible.

797
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,630
I'll also try and get a girlfriend.

798
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,010
Stop!

799
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,030
I'm standing right here.

800
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,080
You guys are deranged today.

801
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,860
What's going on?

802
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,440
Is it because you are in like a monkey mood?

803
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,160
You are just like...

804
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,500
The monkeys make me silly.

805
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,840
Can I get an...

806
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,900
Too much eggnog.

807
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,760
You guys...

808
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,400
I hope Santa is looking at all this, you know?

809
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,140
I hope Santa is viewing all of this and is just like...

810
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:03,380
Oh, gosh.

811
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,720
Oh, gosh.

812
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,680
More money, please.

813
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,730
Monkey make us extra freaky.

814
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:23,450
What's that?

815
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:24,830
You and me, baby.

816
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,550
Ain't nothing but monkey.

817
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,870
Guys, we are so strong.

818
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,530
Let's do this and then we'll...

819
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,050
This, this.

820
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,530
There we go.

821
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:50,510
And...

822
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:51,890
Generates more cash per round.

823
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,330
Increase cash earned up to 20 other merchantmen.

824
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,290
More money!

825
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:06,990
Everyone knows Santa doesn't count between December 25th and January 1st for his list.

826
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,710
That's not true!

827
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,630
I know he's taking time off, but he has elves probably that are still on the hunt.

828
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:14,970
There has to be.

829
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,790
So I need to make more merchantmen, right?

830
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,920
How much did we make?

831
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:30,760
I don't know.

832
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,440
Elves like you.

833
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,220
I'm not an elf.

834
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,000
Where would you get this idea from?

835
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,760
This is like the purge time for Santa's list.

836
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,520
That's so bad.

837
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:08,920
If you consider this to be the purge time for Santa's list, you truly deserve to be on the naughty list.

838
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,560
Permanently.

839
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,880
Only coal, only coal, only coal for you.

840
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,900
Their hormones are all over the place.

841
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,740
Why did this happen?

842
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,680
I'm not encouraging this at all, you guys.

843
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:29,700
Me!

844
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,760
You're freaking me out!

845
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,940
And I'm... I'm always freaked.

846
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,560
It's the map choice.

847
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,960
I didn't think about...

848
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,610
Let's see, what else should we make?

849
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:08,290
Actually, let's save up for...

850
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:10,230
Something.

851
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:10,990
What does this one do?

852
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:14,330
Adds extra pierce and damage to commander and all subs in its radius.

853
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:20,650
If this is the bloom, then whose bloom is it?

854
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:22,150
Bloonarius.

855
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:22,930
Who is that?

856
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,610
Guys, we're killing it!

857
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:36,730
What was the bad... Wait, what was the round that gets super difficult?

858
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,210
Which round is that?

859
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:39,950
Wait.

860
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:48,880
80?

861
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,840
76 has the dense ceramic round.

862
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,320
80.

863
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,340
You've heard of Elf on the Shelf, now get ready for Ghost on the Toast.

864
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,320
Oh my gosh, a mint toaster?

865
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,260
Can you imagine?

866
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,980
Can you imagine?

867
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:14,410
And if you use the toaster, it...

868
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,230
It prints my face on it.

869
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:20,990
Kind of like when people see those Jesus toasts.

870
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:22,850
They're just like, wow!

871
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,490
Oh my god, he's here in my toast!

872
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:29,170
You could say that, but I'm like, haunting your toast.

873
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,700
Wait, no, I want that.

874
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,000
And then...

875
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,060
And then you would get like a jam.

876
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,620
But, what kind of jam would be mint colored?

877
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:50,460
I wonder.

878
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,500
What jam would be mint colored?

879
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,420
Mint jam.

880
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,860
I don't think that would taste good though.

881
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,720
I don't know if that would taste good.

882
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,720
And then...

883
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:12,150
I like this boat.

884
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,010
It doesn't look like it's doing anything.

885
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,850
It's just carrying cargo and it's like, I'm also helping.

886
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:22,630
Let's see.

887
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:26,210
Let's do faster shots.

888
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:28,550
Elf honey.

889
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:29,370
What?

890
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:31,910
Is this game any good?

891
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:35,110
Oh, if you like tower defense, yeah, it's a lot of fun.

892
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:36,570
I recommend.

893
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,830
And it goes on sale a lot too.

894
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,170
So you can usually get it for a decent price.

895
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,710
What should we put on here, you guys?

896
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:48,050
Maybe sniper monkey?

897
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:51,490
We could put soda monkey.

898
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:53,530
She's not gonna reach anything though.

899
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:55,990
Ice monkey.

900
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:59,430
I usually stack two snipers.

901
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:00,930
I'm thinking that too.

902
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,450
Can it fit two up here?

903
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:05,010
Or is it one, one?

904
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:08,390
Ice monkey.

905
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:11,510
You guys, if I put ice monkey here, he won't reach.

906
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:12,970
Actually, he does kind of reach.

907
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,430
Tiny, tiny bit.

908
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:18,670
Just plain ice monkey.

909
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:34,770
I don't know which upgrade should we go with.

910
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,450
Elite defender or the cripple MOAB?

911
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,200
Cripple is good.

912
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,300
I vote MOAB.

913
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:54,680
Okay.

914
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,920
You should also be able to see... the what's it called, right?

915
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,320
You should be able to see camo.

916
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,280
So we don't need the night... Wait, what's this one though?

917
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,240
Oh, the shrapnel.

918
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:21,150
But he's in the range of this, so he should be able to see night vision, right?

919
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,270
Or the camo ones, right?

920
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,790
Mint jelly is an actual real thing.

921
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:30,330
Smuckers makes it?

922
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:31,010
What?

923
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:31,970
Is it any good?

924
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:32,130
What?

925
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,500
The sub doesn't give camo vision.

926
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,440
Submerge to detect camo.

927
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:49,220
He can't see the camo when it goes by.

928
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,660
Okay then.

929
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,120
Oh, that was so fast.

930
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:02,760
MOAB.

931
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:03,780
Handle it.

932
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,600
Do you think he'll kill anyone?

933
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,180
Do you think he'll pop any bloons?

934
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,660
Ice monkey's got an easy life.

935
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,940
Ice monkey really doesn't have to do anything.

936
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,080
Oh yeah, let's set him to strong.

937
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:20,720
Good idea.

938
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,580
Good idea.

939
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,120
He's chilling.

940
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,500
He's just our... He's like our mascot, little ice monkey.

941
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,640
Juggle for me, monkey.

942
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:37,520
Juggle!

943
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,760
Entertain me!

944
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:40,800
Juggle, monkey, juggle!

945
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:45,910
Oh my god, so sorry.

946
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:46,570
Oh my god.

947
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,610
I had the Touhou last word...

948
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,310
I had the Touhou last word stream up.

949
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:53,070
It scared the heck out of me.

950
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,690
I kinda wanna watch.

951
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:03,090
You guys are gonna be talking about me.

952
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:04,290
It's craziness.

953
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:07,370
I don't wanna watch.

954
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:09,270
We'll watch along.

955
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:11,550
Should we?

956
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:15,430
I don't think I would be able to play it though.

957
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,250
I might be able to show it.

958
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:19,350
I don't want them to get mad at me though.

959
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:38,790
Hold on, let me...

960
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:42,250
I'm gonna put it...

961
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,070
Here, down here.

962
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:45,570
On my monitor.

963
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:46,950
There we go.

964
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,090
So I can see it.

965
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,250
I'm gonna keep playing Bloons for now.

966
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:53,870
It's just like a loading screen.

967
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:58,760
Woman.

968
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:00,380
You!

969
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,500
You're the woman.

970
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,520
Where are you going for vacation?

971
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:07,860
Japan?

972
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,420
Why?

973
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,080
Why?

974
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:22,230
How long...

975
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:24,350
Wait!

976
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:26,890
I'm gonna message you right now.

977
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,260
Woman.

978
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,680
I love the way she talks to me.

979
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,720
God!

980
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,520
Yay!

981
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,560
Oh, wait.

982
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,480
OK.

983
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,940
Sorry, I'm typing my love to her.

984
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:37,310
Yay!

985
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,450
Brian, thank you for the 5 gifted!

986
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,450
Thank you!

987
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:49,810
It's the big guy.

988
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:50,510
It's the big guy.

989
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:52,470
I think we got this.

990
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:53,590
I'm gonna eat it.

991
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:56,670
Nice.

992
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,230
Wow, we got lots of money too.

993
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,430
Let's upgrade...

994
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:04,350
This?

995
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:05,550
I thought I had that already.

996
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:06,330
I did not.

997
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,240
Kiara, if you're still here, have you ever played Bloons?

998
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,580
It's so addicting.

999
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,760
Actually, it's so addicting.

1000
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,440
Just watching all the Bloons, watching them all pop and everything.

1001
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:28,500
Mintori Teitei.

1002
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,520
Bring back the Teitei!

1003
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,480
I have no idea what this is.

1004
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,120
It's just a tower defense thing.

1005
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,420
You set up little monkeys and then you pop the Bloons.

1006
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,440
It's really satisfying to watch them all go...

1007
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,560
Arcanize with monkeys.

1008
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,420
Yeah, pretty much.

1009
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,160
Show her the hot monkey.

1010
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:55,820
Which...

1011
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,480
Which one?

1012
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:02,000
I'm trying to get Murmonkey right now.

1013
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,420
But I like this.

1014
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,980
This is my main monkey.

1015
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:11,440
She's really cute.

1016
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:12,640
Her name is Sada.

1017
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,460
I'm not using her right now though because this is a boats...

1018
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,300
Only boats level.

1019
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,300
Look at this guy.

1020
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:29,050
The Pirate Lord!

1021
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:33,730
Oh my gosh, if we just had enough...

1022
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,050
We would be able to get the three.

1023
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,160
Oh, I'm looking at the Touhou last word thing.

1024
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,540
They say today's announcement.

1025
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,620
But the last one is about me.

1026
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,880
So we'll wait until the last announcement.

1027
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:03,120
Guys, do you think we're good for the round 92 or whatever one was the spooky one?

1028
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,060
Do you think we'll be okay?

1029
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,220
I'm scared.

1030
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:21,940
Eat this!

1031
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:24,960
Sorry, I'm like half watching the stream.

1032
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:25,620
I'm so sorry.

1033
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,360
Upgrade sniper.

1034
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,020
Oh yeah!

1035
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:28,780
Thank you.

1036
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,600
Yeah, we'll get him.

1037
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:31,800
Well, once I have the money.

1038
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:34,460
I gotta have the monkey money, you know.

1039
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:35,560
He gets eaten.

1040
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,700
Get eaten, get eaten.

1041
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,900
Literally just yoinked him out of existence.

1042
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,980
I'm gonna maybe do another merchant boat.

1043
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:58,780
We're gonna make so much money.

1044
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,020
Merchant boat.

1045
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,700
I can't squeeze him in.

1046
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,140
No!

1047
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:07,680
No!

1048
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,680
You know who would be able to fit there?

1049
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:10,880
Mermonkey.

1050
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,020
Mermonkey would be able to fit there.

1051
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:21,940
Ice monkey.

1052
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,600
Ice monkey doesn't know how to swim.

1053
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,920
Don't give him that kind of responsibility.

1054
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:39,610
Look at this though.

1055
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:40,610
We're killing it.

1056
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:50,820
Get eaten.

1057
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:55,780
Alright, we're close to be able to... Maybe probably next round we'll be able to upgrade...

1058
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:57,520
You!

1059
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:03,400
Come on!

1060
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,420
Just a little bit more money!

1061
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:05,860
Come on!

1062
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,080
And...

1063
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,080
Upgrade.

1064
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:17,550
Nice.

1065
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:20,030
Nice, nice, nice.

1066
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:22,490
So now we have you, you...

1067
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,490
This guy, let's do...

1068
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:29,250
What's this one?

1069
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:30,410
This one?

1070
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:31,090
We'll do this one.

1071
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:32,130
We'll do the grape shots.

1072
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:34,890
And this one...

1073
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:40,810
Adds extra pierce and damage to commander and all subs.

1074
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:43,130
We should add more subs up here.

1075
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,410
We'll fill this area with submarines.

1076
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,140
We lived!

1077
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:57,180
Oh my god.

1078
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:58,260
Sniper monkey.

1079
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,920
Sniper monkey killed it.

1080
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,540
Oh my god.

1081
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:10,840
Keep going.

1082
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,060
Blow

1083
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:18,840
him up!

1084
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:19,740
Blow him up!

1085
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,160
Nice.

1086
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,200
Nice.

1087
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:26,840
Put him in a headlock.

1088
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,340
They never saw it coming.

1089
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,100
What one should this guy be?

1090
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,420
What one should this little friend be?

1091
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,380
Monkey sub.

1092
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,020
What should he be?

1093
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:47,780
Bottom.

1094
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,980
With a sub commander.

1095
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:52,860
Middle, bottom.

1096
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:01,450
More missiles is good.

1097
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:02,750
Which one is that?

1098
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:05,770
Oh yeah, the ballistic missiles.

1099
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:07,150
I like these ones a lot.

1100
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:08,370
That is true.

1101
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,050
We'll go for middle.

1102
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:10,910
Nice.

1103
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:14,130
Now we save up to upgrade.

1104
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:16,930
Well, we also need to upgrade this guy.

1105
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:30,850
Now that Kiwawa has asked you on a date, I'm asking for your blessing to ask a fellow wisp out?

1106
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,120
A fellow wisp?

1107
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:46,540
Who?

1108
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:48,840
Who?

1109
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,400
Who?

1110
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,440
Ice Monkey, will you marry me?

1111
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,200
I meant it was my birthday tomorrow.

1112
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,100
I wanted to say thank you for a wonderful year.

1113
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:03,420
As a new wisp, I have enjoyed your content and brain rot.

1114
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:05,580
I do have those.

1115
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,100
Your freaky personality has made me so happy with laughter.

1116
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,200
I look forward to 2035.

1117
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,280
Saikou, thank you!

1118
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,160
Happy birthday to you.

1119
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,160
Happy birthday to you.

1120
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:21,380
Happy birthday dear Saikou.

1121
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:26,060
Happy birthday to you.

1122
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:30,380
Happy birthday!

1123
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:36,160
Look, if you guys want to start dating and whatever, that's fine, but like...

1124
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,960
Don't forget about me though.

1125
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:39,740
OK?

1126
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:40,840
I don't know.

1127
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,280
I'm needy a little bit sometimes.

1128
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,340
I'm whatever.

1129
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:45,080
I don't know.

1130
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:45,140
I don't know.

1131
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,630
Who is mint?

1132
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,840
I'm gonna lose it.

1133
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,400
I'm gonna lose it for real.

1134
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,300
Gonna lose it for real.

1135
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,700
Can I have your blessing to date Ayami Mama?

1136
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:13,420
Hey, if you join membership, you become boyfriend with Ayami.

1137
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,240
So honestly...

1138
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,740
I mean, you're kind of competing with like...

1139
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:39,830
We didn't even lose a life though.

1140
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:42,590
I wonder if I should get this guy.

1141
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:47,810
If we should get this guy, because he'll generate lives for us.

1142
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:48,850
Which one is it?

1143
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:49,370
This one.

1144
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:50,490
Jungle bounty.

1145
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:54,190
My freaky Yoshi is parasocial?

1146
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:54,250
No?

1147
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:06,310
Look,

1148
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,820
he's right next to Mermonkey.

1149
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:14,640
They're probably besties.

1150
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,800
I'm gonna put him right here.

1151
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,660
Wait, this is the middle path, right?

1152
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,200
Yeah, middle path.

1153
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,540
Can I have your blessing to marry a Wisp?

1154
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:34,250
It's pretty easy to become a marriage officiant online.

1155
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:38,190
If you do that, you can attend every Wisp wedding and marry all of us.

1156
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,550
Why is this turning into like Hinge?

1157
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:42,390
What is this?

1158
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:44,350
37 million... Stop!

1159
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:46,410
It's such a female who's freaky.

1160
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:47,650
It's a freaky ghost.

1161
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:48,830
What is this?

1162
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:51,850
This is not like an online chat room.

1163
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:57,590
It's coughing season.

1164
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:00,410
Is that... What is that?

1165
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:05,150
Are you going to jail?

1166
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:07,890
What is a coughing season?

1167
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:11,450
Coughing season?

1168
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:13,110
Because you get sick?

1169
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:15,590
Is it like a...

1170
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:19,270
Hydrogen bomb versus coughing baby.

1171
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:23,530
Hydrogen bomb versus coughing season.

1172
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:26,890
Permission to get another Wisp pregnant.

1173
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:27,930
Denied!

1174
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,090
Denied!

1175
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:30,210
Denied!

1176
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:31,210
Denied!

1177
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:32,210
Denied!

1178
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:32,670
Denied!

1179
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:33,110
Denied!

1180
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:33,570
Denied!

1181
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:34,530
Denied!

1182
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:38,430
Stop getting pregnant!

1183
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:39,430
Stop!

1184
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:41,870
Stop pregnancy!

1185
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:43,450
Stop getting pregnant!

1186
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:47,330
Stop getting pregnant right now!

1187
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:06,880
Question for my fellow Wisp ASL...

1188
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,760
I can't win.

1189
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,480
I can't win.

1190
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:17,490
I returned to what happened.

1191
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,790
Don't worry about it.

1192
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:20,050
If you don't know that's fine.

1193
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:23,850
I feel like I missed some important context here.

1194
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:26,570
No, no, there is no context.

1195
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,970
I don't think.

1196
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:30,050
It's just that everybody is...

1197
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,010
Everybody...

1198
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:33,390
Everybody is...

1199
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,670
I'm going to put this guy here.

1200
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:38,850
He also makes money.

1201
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:54,580
We gotta upgrade our guys.

1202
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:07,680
Oh boy, 2 AM.

1203
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,200
No!

1204
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,420
Hi Pinto, it's also my birthday tomorrow.

1205
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,080
Can I get a song?

1206
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,060
So have fun on your trip.

1207
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,360
Thank you Xiaorulu!

1208
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,940
Happy birthday to you.

1209
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,780
Happy birthday to you.

1210
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,940
Happy birthday dear Xiaorulu.

1211
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,440
Happy birthday to you.

1212
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:31,340
Happy birthday!

1213
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,320
I don't know what is happening in this stream, but I'm highly infused.

1214
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,420
Is my pain enjoyment for you?

1215
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:47,020
Not gonna lie, I probably have a better chance of finding someone special here on your channel compared to the real Jews on Tinder, Hinge and Bumble combined.

1216
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:48,660
You know, that's so fair.

1217
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,060
Hot single wisps in your area looking to get freaky.

1218
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,020
I guess that's kind of true.

1219
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,420
Probably would have a better chance, right?

1220
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,840
Do people still use Tinder anymore?

1221
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,760
I only mentioned Hinge because I keep getting ads for them.

1222
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,700
Like what are you trying to say, huh?

1223
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:18,340
I keep getting ads for Hinge.

1224
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,900
They are going hard on the advertising.

1225
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:24,980
It's hell out there.

1226
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:29,400
I heard Tinder is almost only hookups now.

1227
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,380
Tinder is still the most popular.

1228
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,220
Looking for femboy wisps.

1229
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,240
Should we just have like a blind date stream or something?

1230
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,520
I'll just sit here and you guys all figure it out in chat.

1231
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:51,520
I'll sit here and you guys all be like...

1232
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,500
Okay, you guys go...

1233
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,260
Speed dating.

1234
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:00,480
Hashtag wisp bingle.

1235
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:06,100
Okay, I'm just gonna play Bloons now then and you guys can figure it out.

1236
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:37,330
My ears!

1237
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:38,730
It was getting so rumbly.

1238
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:46,470
Would any wisp in chat like to accompany me to a black tie formal event in San Jose, California next June?

1239
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:50,790
What is going on in June?

1240
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:55,090
I can afford it.

1241
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:56,090
Let's go!

1242
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,880
Anybody here like redubers?

1243
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:09,620
Look!

1244
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:10,620
It's expanding!

1245
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,480
It's expanding!

1246
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,560
I can't... I can't... I can't grab it.

1247
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,980
Okay, round 100!

1248
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,780
Yeah baby!

1249
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,020
I'm gonna add another... Wait.

1250
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:38,960
Oh this guy is close to upgrading.

1251
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:41,140
We'll just do the next one and then we'll upgrade him.

1252
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,040
Oh wait.

1253
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,800
No, we want to upgrade this guy instead.

1254
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:50,400
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

1255
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,560
There we go.

1256
01:18:58,880 --> 01:18:59,800
Wait, I died?

1257
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:20,410
Our monkey star with the one million pops.

1258
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:22,010
Let's go!

1259
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,170
Oh, it was a bunch of DDTs.

1260
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:31,530
I didn't even see it happen.

1261
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:32,390
Me neither!

1262
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:35,710
I lost it all.

1263
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:37,610
Wait, hold on.

1264
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:41,470
By the power of Battle Cat... Hold on.

1265
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:47,330
I have two million more pops.

1266
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:48,450
Two!

1267
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:49,950
Two and a half!

1268
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:52,290
Over two and a half million more to pop.

1269
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:54,530
Nice black lady.

1270
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:55,490
That's cute.

1271
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:59,610
I'm still watching too.

1272
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:00,870
Battle Cat.

1273
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:02,490
That's another fun game, Battle Cat.

1274
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:05,590
Wait.

1275
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:08,290
We only got...

1276
01:20:10,370 --> 01:20:12,530
We only got 300,000?

1277
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:15,990
How is that possible when our one guy got one million?

1278
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:22,950
Why didn't it do all of the balloons?

1279
01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:25,190
I'm so confused.

1280
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:30,980
My happy catman.

1281
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:31,480
Yeah!

1282
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:33,620
Goat.

1283
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:34,920
Goat-men-nashai.

1284
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,540
Thank you so much for ordering it.

1285
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:43,240
Came by to say I completed Jingle Freaks and enjoyed which everyone should complete.

1286
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:44,560
Thank you!

1287
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,560
The game can't math.

1288
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:49,620
No!

1289
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,220
Are we getting scammed?

1290
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,880
You guys are getting scammed for real.

1291
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:02,610
It's pops, not damage.

1292
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:11,790
Layers don't count, only individual balloons.

1293
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:14,810
No!

1294
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,370
You got the monkey money, so losing at round 102 is basically min-maxing.

1295
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:19,290
You know it's so true.

1296
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:22,990
So true.

1297
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,380
Oh wait.

1298
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:33,460
The who is a secret because they're watching, but you can find out if I'm successful.

1299
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:34,960
I do not think I will.

1300
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:35,840
No!

1301
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,300
Wait, why don't you think you'll be successful with the day?

1302
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,100
Wait, they're watching?

1303
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,100
Who is it?

1304
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,420
Is it Neon?

1305
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,360
Is it Justifan?

1306
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:52,920
Is it Gabriel?

1307
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:55,260
Who is it?

1308
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:56,500
Is it Garlamon?

1309
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:57,800
Who is it?

1310
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:02,560
I can't remember which all of you actually are married and stuff.

1311
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,360
I can't remember.

1312
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:05,480
Is it Co-op?

1313
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:06,600
Who is it?

1314
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,000
Is it Yuki?

1315
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,480
Is it Verilin?

1316
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,520
Who is it?

1317
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,200
Is it Enchel?

1318
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,140
It's a thousand percent me.

1319
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:17,780
It's Shaggy.

1320
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:18,800
It's Shaggy.

1321
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:19,840
It's Shaggy.

1322
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:20,500
It's Shaggy.

1323
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,100
It's Shaggy.

1324
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:22,260
It's Shaggy.

1325
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,320
IrishJive, welcome to the FanFu Show.

1326
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,060
Thank you.

1327
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,080
You're just gonna list everyone?

1328
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:33,780
Yeah, is it Fae?

1329
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:34,980
Is it Fae?

1330
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:35,820
Is it Invader?

1331
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,180
Is it Nashi?

1332
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:42,180
Is it Jovec?

1333
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,320
Haha, couldn't be me.

1334
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:47,420
Jovec, aren't you also in a relationship?

1335
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,060
I can't remember.

1336
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,280
Is it Delaran?

1337
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,080
Is it Delaran?

1338
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:53,640
Is it Delaran?

1339
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,220
Is it Delaran?

1340
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:54,800
Is it Delaran?

1341
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:06,560
If only it was me.

1342
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,900
It could be you, Derpyus.

1343
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,440
Yeah, he has a man already.

1344
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,080
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

1345
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:18,740
I remember.

1346
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:22,580
I remember.

1347
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:27,160
I am, but my boyfriend has a normal sleep schedule and is always sleeping during your streams.

1348
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:29,140
Stop!

1349
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,960
I'm not part of this drama.

1350
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,100
I'm not part of this drama.

1351
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,720
But I'm the cause of the drama.

1352
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:44,280
I'm not part of it, but I'm the cause.

1353
01:23:58,230 --> 01:23:59,410
She's such a freak.

1354
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:01,670
She's a super freak.

1355
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:02,810
Super freak.

1356
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:03,970
She's super freaky.

1357
01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:05,510
Why have I never sung that song?

1358
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:09,330
Why has nobody ever asked me to sing that song in karaoke?

1359
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:12,430
It's literally our song.

1360
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:16,830
Nobody has ever asked us.

1361
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:18,790
I have requested it.

1362
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:20,350
No, you're just saying that.

1363
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:22,150
We have?

1364
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:23,970
Wait, no you haven't.

1365
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:24,590
We have?

1366
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:26,070
Wait, you have?

1367
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,210
What is it called?

1368
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:33,890
No.

1369
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:34,230
We have?

1370
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:36,630
No.

1371
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:41,390
No, it's called Super Freak.

1372
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:44,370
Maybe I thought you guys were kidding.

1373
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:52,410
Maybe I thought you guys were like...

1374
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:56,210
We're like gaslighting.

1375
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:56,710
I don't know.

1376
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:58,430
Not gaslighting, but you know...

1377
01:24:58,910 --> 01:24:59,910
You know what I mean.

1378
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:07,370
Maybe I thought you guys were just calling me a freak.

1379
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:08,130
I don't know.

1380
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:10,550
That's so silly.

1381
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:15,990
I'm gaslighting you right now.

1382
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:22,180
Hi Minky.

1383
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:22,820
Hi!

1384
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:32,960
I did!

1385
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:34,880
Thank you!

1386
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,900
Lucia, thank you!

1387
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:38,900
Minky, thank you.

1388
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,960
Still waiting on Invisible 2.

1389
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,000
I know!

1390
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,400
I'm gonna get to it.

1391
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:49,660
I wanna do like a fuller Metal Gear themed karaoke.

1392
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:57,380
While waiting in line for the concert, one of the horse carriages across the street started blaring Super Freak.

1393
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:58,420
It was quite appropriate.

1394
01:25:58,840 --> 01:25:59,740
Horse carriages?

1395
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:05,060
The old Atlanta had horse carriages.

1396
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,170
Mint will learn the best is yet to come.

1397
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:18,670
I've actually been trying, but not in the Gaelic, you know, because it's kind of hard.

1398
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:22,770
But, you know...

1399
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:23,710
Love Steam though?

1400
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,860
Horse carriage did pass by the line.

1401
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:35,100
Really?

1402
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:36,840
That's so awesome.

1403
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:41,660
Wait, do not Midwest cities have horse carriages?

1404
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:47,020
Do all cities have a horse carriage?

1405
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:52,220
I feel like I've seen horse carriages, but I've only seen them in movies.

1406
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,700
So, like, I always thought that they were just like a...

1407
01:26:55,700 --> 01:27:00,480
I'm in New York and I'm on a horse carriage.

1408
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,640
What's up, cities?

1409
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:05,740
There's a novel to you.

1410
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,520
Requesting telephone number by Junko Ohashi.

1411
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,740
This isn't karaoke!

1412
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,880
Let me write that down.

1413
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:27,120
Where's mine?

1414
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:27,560
There it is.

1415
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:39,560
NYC definitely has a ton of horse carriages, right?

1416
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:40,900
I feel like I've seen them in movies.

1417
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:44,620
Wow!

1418
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,500
Oh, that's an elf.

1419
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:48,540
That's an elf.

1420
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:50,100
Oh, nope, that's a ninja monkey.

1421
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:54,500
Why is this guy looking at me funny?

1422
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,820
I don't like it.

1423
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:57,860
Events.

1424
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:01,780
Contested territory, odyssey.

1425
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,100
There's so much going on in Bloons.

1426
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,860
I just like to play vanilla Bloons, you know.

1427
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,460
Multiple elves on screen.

1428
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,060
There's this guy.

1429
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:14,900
Him.

1430
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:21,200
Next time you go to Otakutani, I should try it in the old port.

1431
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,140
If anything, I'm surprised Mata didn't drag you to a ride.

1432
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,380
I went to the old port.

1433
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:30,440
I went to the old port, but I think it was because it was late at night.

1434
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,800
Maybe there were no horses around.

1435
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,260
Elf on the shelf.

1436
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:41,000
I modded you into this game once.

1437
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,520
Wait, was that you?

1438
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,500
I saw one time, it was like this guy who plays a bunch of Bloons.

1439
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,440
And he was like, I'm trying out this spooky ghost mod.

1440
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,420
And it was just me.

1441
01:28:56,320 --> 01:29:01,180
How do I... Wait, oh, what we're... Hold on, play...

1442
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:02,440
Oh, we unlocked some.

1443
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:03,040
Wow.

1444
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,060
We unlocked a ton.

1445
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,540
Midnight Mansion looks fun.

1446
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:10,120
Is it community?

1447
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:11,460
Oh, here we go.

1448
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:16,120
We can go to the Walmart.

1449
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:20,280
Bloons shoplift from Walmart map, that's really good.

1450
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,080
POV around the naughty list map.

1451
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,680
What is this?

1452
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:30,720
Standard longest map half speed.

1453
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:33,800
Arctic night kind of goes really hard.

1454
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,920
Into the storm.

1455
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,760
Unknown ruins.

1456
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,460
It's a... What's it called?

1457
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:48,600
It's a Pokemon.

1458
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:50,700
Oh, these are featured.

1459
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,380
Let's see, most liked.

1460
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,060
Oh, see, I've liked this one.

1461
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,240
Interstellar is so cool, I like this one.

1462
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:03,680
Oh my god.

1463
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:05,800
Bore.

1464
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,440
Guess we do in Bloons.

1465
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,580
These are so good.

1466
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,760
I made a mistake with my Christmas turkey and now my house is being haunted by a poultrygeist.

1467
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,420
Any idea how to deal with this foul spirit?

1468
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:36,720
No, you're so screwed, man.

1469
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:38,460
Sorry.

1470
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:41,460
Maxwell.

1471
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:46,000
How do people do the...

1472
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:52,620
How do they go so fast?

1473
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,840
I know that's not Maxwell, but I'm just curious.

1474
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:04,140
Practice.

1475
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,000
Practice.

1476
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:05,600
What is that?

1477
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,520
That's insane.

1478
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,900
Space is water.

1479
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:11,600
These are so crazy looking.

1480
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,800
Guys, let's search for a map.

1481
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:14,760
What should I look up?

1482
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:15,520
What should I look up?

1483
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:23,100
Search mint.

1484
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:28,070
Arctic mint.

1485
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:29,330
Bombard.

1486
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:30,090
Mint.

1487
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:31,290
Mint monkey.

1488
01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:34,630
That's just a random polar bear.

1489
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:37,470
Mint fuzzball.

1490
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,720
Mint toe.

1491
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:48,040
These are the same ones as before though.

1492
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:51,920
Yeah.

1493
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:54,960
I think I played both of these.

1494
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:57,740
Mint toe.

1495
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:58,620
Made of mint toe.

1496
01:31:58,780 --> 01:31:59,440
Right there.

1497
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:01,280
In your Bloons.

1498
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:03,740
More likely than you think.

1499
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:06,500
Way more likely than you think.

1500
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:08,220
Search brain rot.

1501
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:08,960
I'm scared.

1502
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:16,340
None of these make sense.

1503
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:18,060
Wait, I want to look up FNAF.

1504
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:23,960
What?

1505
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:38,580
See, this one is good.

1506
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:41,960
That one is pretty good.

1507
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:45,380
Search Freddy.

1508
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:46,140
Yeah, Freddy.

1509
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:55,450
It's the...

1510
01:32:55,450 --> 01:33:03,230
It's the artistic...

1511
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:05,330
Like...

1512
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:06,550
Disparity.

1513
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:10,270
I don't think... Oh my god.

1514
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:15,170
I don't think that there will be any Metal Gear ones because...

1515
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:17,610
You guys, Bloons is for children.

1516
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:19,210
But I'll search.

1517
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:21,670
Metal.

1518
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:25,290
It's looking pretty grim.

1519
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:27,650
Nothing.

1520
01:33:28,730 --> 01:33:29,290
Nothing.

1521
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:32,390
You take that back.

1522
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:35,090
Try MGS.

1523
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:48,550
It's the Psycho Mantis room.

1524
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:50,650
It's the same guy who did both of them.

1525
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:53,070
You guys, this deserves more likes.

1526
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:55,270
And Vulcan Raven's Canyon.

1527
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:56,570
No way!

1528
01:33:57,070 --> 01:33:58,070
Which one should we do?

1529
01:33:58,490 --> 01:34:00,590
This one we are going to do with only Ice Monkey.

1530
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:11,860
Oh my god, are these supposed to... Wait, no.

1531
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:12,780
These are the cameras.

1532
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,720
That's so cool.

1533
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:24,830
Ice Monkey.

1534
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:26,390
We can't afford him.

1535
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:28,910
Will this count towards the Mermonkey?

1536
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:29,370
I wonder.

1537
01:34:32,910 --> 01:34:33,750
Oh, there's Ice Monkey.

1538
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:37,970
What was the last problem?

1539
01:34:38,150 --> 01:34:40,910
The last time I tried using only Ice Monkey and...

1540
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:42,070
Uh-oh.

1541
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,410
Ice Monkey, stop being so slow.

1542
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:44,110
Ice Monkey.

1543
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:44,890
Ice Monkey.

1544
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:52,620
Yikes.

1545
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:54,540
Yikes.

1546
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,200
The ice in me and Bloons.

1547
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,320
I don't think so because it's custom.

1548
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,360
Oh no.

1549
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:09,320
Let's go for... I guess we'll go for this one.

1550
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,600
Since it's the one that I have most unlocked.

1551
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:18,630
Uh-oh.

1552
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:19,830
Oh no.

1553
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:20,930
Oh no.

1554
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,730
Oh no.

1555
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:26,050
Oh no.

1556
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:27,330
Oh god.

1557
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:32,960
We're so dead.

1558
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:39,110
We're so dead.

1559
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:41,790
Permafrost strong?

1560
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:42,090
OK.

1561
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:44,630
Oh god.

1562
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:48,910
Guys!

1563
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:55,300
The way they slow... What?

1564
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:58,220
There's no time for juggling right now, Ice Monkey.

1565
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:02,160
Guys, this is a real battle.

1566
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:13,770
This is so bad.

1567
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:21,980
Wait, if your hands are like this, what's clapping?

1568
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:24,880
You don't see my thighs?

1569
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:30,390
It's my thighs clapping.

1570
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:31,210
Duh.

1571
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:50,080
Nice.

1572
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:52,620
Oh my gosh, we can't afford another guy yet.

1573
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:55,360
We're at 50 health.

1574
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:59,380
Guys, we're in so much trouble.

1575
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:02,520
We're in so much trouble.

1576
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:10,580
Guys, I'm watching.

1577
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:11,420
This is it.

1578
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:15,140
This is the end of us.

1579
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:17,460
Nice.

1580
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,960
We can afford a second Ice Monkey!

1581
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:26,860
OK, nice.

1582
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:28,960
Monkeys don't belong in Alaska.

1583
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:31,720
It sounds like something else.

1584
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:32,580
I'm not going to lie.

1585
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:33,480
What do you mean by that?

1586
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,440
Did we lose any lives?

1587
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:49,200
I wasn't looking.

1588
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:49,620
Sorry.

1589
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:54,820
I'm gonna turn down the volume and get your... I'm literally clapping.

1590
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:55,540
What's wrong?

1591
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:58,260
I'm just clapping along with the Ice Monkey.

1592
01:38:04,370 --> 01:38:06,170
Oh my god.

1593
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:06,790
Fast.

1594
01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:07,650
Fast.

1595
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:08,290
Nice.

1596
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:09,350
Nice.

1597
01:38:09,610 --> 01:38:10,090
Nice.

1598
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:11,170
We got that permafrost.

1599
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:11,990
They're still slow.

1600
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:17,010
Nice.

1601
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:21,710
Guys, I think maybe on the last word...

1602
01:38:23,890 --> 01:38:25,490
I might be coming up.

1603
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:30,150
Here we go.

1604
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:34,190
Oh no.

1605
01:38:34,490 --> 01:38:35,730
We lost lives.

1606
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:36,530
Oh gosh.

1607
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:45,080
Just keep going until I die.

1608
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:47,040
Hold on.

1609
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:47,220
Wait.

1610
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:47,620
What's this?

1611
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:48,900
Deep freeze.

1612
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,040
Attack faster.

1613
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:51,740
Attack faster.

1614
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:52,540
We need to faster.

1615
01:38:57,690 --> 01:38:58,890
Stay freaky, Minto.

1616
01:38:59,130 --> 01:38:59,990
Thank you.

1617
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:05,000
Oh my god.

1618
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:06,080
We're not gonna make it.

1619
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:07,420
We're still not gonna make it.

1620
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,440
Santiago, thank you for the Akasupa.

1621
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:23,300
Thank you.

1622
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,660
Minto, banana monkey.

1623
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,180
I didn't throw.

1624
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:35,340
It's just... It's just... It ain't easy.

1625
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:40,700
Being...

1626
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:41,540
A monkey.

1627
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,640
Defeat on Vulcan Raven.

1628
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:57,440
Nicholas, thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

1629
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:00,480
Do you plan on playing Stellar Blade?

1630
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:03,940
I have an extra DLC code for the game if you'd like it.

1631
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,200
Not offered to someone else.

1632
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,880
I currently don't have any plans to play it, but thank you Brandon.

1633
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:11,720
Yeah, please give it to someone else.

1634
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:31,660
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey.

1635
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:32,720
We died!

1636
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:34,380
Thank you for the gifted.

1637
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:37,240
Juggalug, thanks for the 8 months.

1638
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:40,860
Spicy Cheese, thanks for the 3 months.

1639
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:42,240
Being cheesy.

1640
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:45,780
Search for a Touhou map.

1641
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:46,240
True!

1642
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:49,680
I'll just search... Touhou.

1643
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:52,100
Oh my god!

1644
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:53,300
Touhou Reimu.

1645
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:54,740
Wait, there's actually...

1646
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:57,360
There's actually so much.

1647
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:58,360
Mistia Izakaya.

1648
01:40:58,540 --> 01:40:59,880
Wait, someone asked me about that earlier.

1649
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:01,160
I saw your super chat.

1650
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:05,180
I do have... I have... I have it...

1651
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:07,540
I have Mistia's Izakaya.

1652
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:08,620
I own it.

1653
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:10,980
So, I could play it whenever.

1654
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:12,880
KC Roger, thanks for the 5 gifted.

1655
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:14,680
Thank you, thank you.

1656
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:17,380
These are so cute.

1657
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,040
This Reimu is so cute.

1658
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,280
Marisa Hakurei.

1659
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,380
Marisa Hakurei is kind of cracked.

1660
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,680
That's so cute.

1661
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:32,140
Marisa, a sad Touhou project.

1662
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:34,420
Fuumon.

1663
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:42,280
I thought I was gonna have to put in Reimu or something, you know?

1664
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:47,000
Where's Bad Apple?

1665
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:49,280
They couldn't even put Bad Apple in Bloons.

1666
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:51,120
SMH.

1667
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,100
Thank you, it's the best thing to come in 2024.

1668
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:55,640
Thank you, Mr. Phantom.

1669
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,440
Why do you have my name?

1670
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:03,540
The Touhou maps are good on here.

1671
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,640
I like this just... Just Marisa.

1672
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:13,040
This one's so cool, how they made Yomu's hair like the rocks.

1673
01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:21,360
I wonder if, like, with this one, if the Bloons look like the Danmaku coming all over, you know?

1674
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:24,040
I made a map for you a while back.

1675
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:26,400
The code is...

1676
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,540
Do I put it in here?

1677
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,980
Where do I put it?

1678
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:38,080
You wanna read it and let a chat member get it?

1679
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:39,940
Sure!

1680
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,100
They can just put it in the chat.

1681
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:47,560
Caps?

1682
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:52,420
No...

1683
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:56,140
Where do I put in a...

1684
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,400
Where would I put in a code?

1685
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,940
It says code here, hold on.

1686
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:05,120
Z...

1687
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:06,800
Z...

1688
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,240
F-M-E-M-Y-D.

1689
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,440
It doesn't find it.

1690
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,280
Turn off filters.

1691
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:23,560
I don't have any... Wait, what filters?

1692
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,240
I don't have any filters on.

1693
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:32,860
I'm not sure.

1694
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:38,400
Sorry.

1695
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:40,920
I wanna try it though.

1696
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:43,480
Map gone.

1697
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:47,000
Sad, sad, sad.

1698
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:48,220
Maybe I got purged?

1699
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:48,820
Can that happen?

1700
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:53,520
Here is a DLC for Stellar Blade if anybody wants it.

1701
01:43:58,820 --> 01:43:59,480
2DP3JFJ8FDB.

1702
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:02,980
Claim.

1703
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:04,040
Somebody claim.

1704
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:10,980
Somebody claim.

1705
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:18,790
Sleeper cell wisp just got activated.

1706
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:28,580
You might be able to search Mint or Matara.

1707
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:29,940
I tried Mint earlier.

1708
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:32,340
Let's try searching Matara.

1709
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:34,680
Nope.

1710
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:35,820
Good.

1711
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:43,030
Mintara.

1712
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:44,710
Nothing.

1713
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:45,390
Good.

1714
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:50,050
Good.

1715
01:44:51,490 --> 01:44:52,350
Doki burn.

1716
01:44:54,450 --> 01:44:55,370
Doki.

1717
01:44:56,110 --> 01:44:58,170
What is this?

1718
01:44:58,790 --> 01:44:59,230
Doki.

1719
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:02,690
Hmm.

1720
01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:04,950
Ghost?

1721
01:45:07,110 --> 01:45:09,310
Why are these so cursed?

1722
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:12,930
Why are these all so cursed?

1723
01:45:13,710 --> 01:45:15,030
Ghost beach.

1724
01:45:15,630 --> 01:45:16,730
Ghost leg?

1725
01:45:19,090 --> 01:45:20,430
Ghost hunters.

1726
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:22,250
Ghost trail.

1727
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:23,170
Thank you Minto.

1728
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:23,870
Thank you!

1729
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:24,810
What are you talking about?

1730
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:25,710
Why are you thanking me?

1731
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:32,710
Let's see Kiara.

1732
01:45:33,490 --> 01:45:35,130
Let's try Hololive.

1733
01:45:35,730 --> 01:45:35,870
No.

1734
01:45:37,570 --> 01:45:38,350
Kiwawa.

1735
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:39,610
None.

1736
01:45:42,270 --> 01:45:43,050
Sad.

1737
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:47,250
Where is the people making the maps?

1738
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:47,890
Vtuber.

1739
01:45:48,070 --> 01:45:48,710
Yeah, try Vtuber.

1740
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:52,250
I remade my Vtuber model into a map.

1741
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:52,670
Cute!

1742
01:45:54,690 --> 01:45:56,890
The single Vtuber on here.

1743
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:05,310
Henya.

1744
01:46:07,170 --> 01:46:07,650
None.

1745
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:10,970
One for Henya.

1746
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:12,470
Fauna.

1747
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:16,070
Look how cute the sapling!

1748
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:22,980
Cute.

1749
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:31,180
Very sad I think it got purged.

1750
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,100
I can view it.

1751
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:35,240
It doesn't show on the search even with the code.

1752
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:36,140
I'm so sorry.

1753
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:37,460
That's so messed up.

1754
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:38,740
Why would it get purged?

1755
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:44,420
Try Dokia.

1756
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:45,660
I already tried Dokia earlier.

1757
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,440
Try Wisp.

1758
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:48,240
Wisp.

1759
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:54,120
This is something very different.

1760
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:57,060
Wisp forest.

1761
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:57,940
Oh, this one looks cool.

1762
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:00,320
Actually, it looks like little wisps.

1763
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:03,000
But wisp is just like also like a word, you know.

1764
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:06,160
Might not be published yet.

1765
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:08,960
Oh yeah, could you republish it maybe?

1766
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:11,080
Try Maid.

1767
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:15,080
It's me!

1768
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:17,960
It's me!

1769
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:19,720
Gura.

1770
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:24,120
That's definitely...

1771
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:26,900
She turned herself into a bush Morty.

1772
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:36,850
Nice.

1773
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:40,390
Takodachi garden.

1774
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:42,630
Cute.

1775
01:47:44,350 --> 01:47:44,950
What else?

1776
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:47,030
Maybe like Iron Mouse.

1777
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:48,410
No.

1778
01:47:48,770 --> 01:47:49,430
Mousey.

1779
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:51,190
No.

1780
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:52,190
Who else?

1781
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:55,950
Amelia.

1782
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:03,160
That sure is Sonic the Hedgehog.

1783
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:11,760
I don't...

1784
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,380
I don't

1785
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:30,100
know how I'm logging it.

1786
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,060
Oh gosh.

1787
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:40,140
Why is there only one page?

1788
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:42,580
This one's great though.

1789
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:43,860
This one's so good.

1790
01:48:57,150 --> 01:48:58,750
None for Sonic.

1791
01:48:59,930 --> 01:49:01,550
None for Sonic.

1792
01:49:01,850 --> 01:49:02,210
Pecora.

1793
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:04,050
None.

1794
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:21,480
Oh my gosh.

1795
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:23,320
Nice.

1796
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,480
Wait, maybe not nice.

1797
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:27,880
I have to ask.

1798
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:32,800
Sorry, I just was watching the Lost Word thing and they announced...

1799
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,560
The concert that they're doing.

1800
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:35,620
June 28th.

1801
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:36,840
And I wanted to go.

1802
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,720
But I didn't know when the date was going to be.

1803
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:43,660
And I was like, oh my gosh, what if it interferes with Ofukai?

1804
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:49,620
I was like, what if it interferes with Ofukai?

1805
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,220
But it doesn't.

1806
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:56,500
It doesn't.

1807
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:04,720
But there was also something else that I need to do in June, so...

1808
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,440
Hmm...

1809
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:10,020
I will have to see.

1810
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:13,060
Rip Ofukai I guess.

1811
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:13,720
What are you talking about?

1812
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,640
I just said it works.

1813
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:16,800
No, it's all good.

1814
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:17,880
It's the week after.

1815
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:21,280
Yeah, I'm busy busy.

1816
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:22,960
Busy busy.

1817
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:25,440
If you skip Ofukai I will die.

1818
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,520
What are you talking about?

1819
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:34,400
Hi Ice Minky.

1820
01:50:34,620 --> 01:50:34,920
Hi!

1821
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:38,980
I haven't been able to watch much over the holidays, but I just want to thank you for being silly and hope you have fun in Japan.

1822
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:39,980
Thank you!

1823
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:43,120
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1824
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:46,220
Okay, I'm gonna watch...

1825
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:48,960
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna watch...

1826
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,380
I'm gonna, I'm gonna un-Minky.

1827
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:56,280
Goodbye.

1828
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:57,360
Goodbye.

1829
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:59,980
And I'm going to...

1830
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:01,440
Put on...

1831
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:03,860
Or I'm going to have a Touhou Lost Word.

1832
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:07,640
But I'm not gonna have, sorry, I'm not gonna have like the audio, cause I...

1833
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:08,220
I...

1834
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:09,320
I'm not...

1835
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:11,000
Think I can do that.

1836
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:12,920
It's excellent.

1837
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:13,780
Thank you!

1838
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:15,720
Thanks for ordering it!

1839
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:20,400
Today is a bit of a shorter stream, so I really wanted to watch the Lost Word thing.

1840
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:22,100
And play just a little bit of Bloons.

1841
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:23,680
Right before I leave, you know.

1842
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:24,620
You should link it here.

1843
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:25,600
I will.

1844
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:27,720
I'm just writing something.

1845
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:30,700
I'm writing something up first.

1846
01:51:32,660 --> 01:51:33,380
Text.

1847
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:41,580
Wait, hold on.

1848
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:42,700
Text.

1849
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:49,720
But then I'm gonna copy and duplicate it.

1850
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:50,920
Duplicate, there we go.

1851
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:51,800
Okay.

1852
01:51:52,620 --> 01:51:53,780
And then, watching...

1853
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:55,020
Watching...

1854
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:58,880
Touhou Lost Word...

1855
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:00,920
Dev...

1856
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:01,460
Stream.

1857
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:07,160
And...

1858
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:11,180
To think this is our last stream of the year.

1859
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:12,440
I know, right?

1860
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:14,900
That's so silly.

1861
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:16,600
And then you can watch it here.

1862
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:18,980
Touhou...

1863
01:52:18,980 --> 01:52:20,780
Lost Word...

1864
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:23,400
Dev...

1865
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:23,680
Stream.

1866
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:27,180
And you're probably just like, why are we watching this, Minkyu?

1867
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:27,780
It's because...

1868
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,200
They're gonna be talking about me!

1869
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:31,780
And I want you guys...

1870
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:34,300
Um...

1871
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:34,700
To see!

1872
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:38,240
And I also wanna see what they're saying.

1873
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:40,500
I imagine...

1874
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,100
How long are their dev streams usually?

1875
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:43,440
Like an hour?

1876
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:44,060
Probably?

1877
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:45,780
So I imagine...

1878
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:46,960
Probably...

1879
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,740
Oh, that one's an hour and a half.

1880
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,140
That one's an hour.

1881
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:52,160
We'll see.

1882
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:58,460
But also, I'm starting to get so sleepy, you guys.

1883
01:52:58,520 --> 01:52:59,240
I'm so sorry.

1884
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:02,440
I'm getting so sleepy.

1885
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:04,020
I'm starting to get like...

1886
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:09,380
So I'm just kind of like...

1887
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:12,500
I just have more to do before I leave.

1888
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:17,260
I didn't sleep much last night.

1889
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:19,720
I fell asleep at like 5 AM.

1890
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:22,140
And then I had to wake up early for an appointment I had.

1891
01:53:22,140 --> 01:53:25,140
And the appointment was at...

1892
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:26,620
9.

1893
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:28,480
So I was like...

1894
01:53:37,570 --> 01:53:38,370
They said...

1895
01:53:39,010 --> 01:53:40,850
Oh, they just said that's it.

1896
01:53:41,010 --> 01:53:41,350
So maybe...

1897
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:48,870
Go sleep.

1898
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:49,790
I gotta sleep!

1899
01:53:50,050 --> 01:53:50,410
Oh, sorry.

1900
01:53:50,550 --> 01:53:51,990
If you heard that, I just kicked my mic.

1901
01:53:52,990 --> 01:53:54,650
Oh.

1902
01:53:55,570 --> 01:53:57,010
Special announcement.

1903
01:54:00,670 --> 01:54:02,330
Wait, I'm gonna type too.

1904
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:05,230
Special announcement.

1905
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:33,340
Who is that?

1906
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,360
Oh

1907
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:40,320
my god, that's me!

1908
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:05,570
I'm embarrassed right now.

1909
01:55:05,790 --> 01:55:05,970
Wait.

1910
01:55:09,850 --> 01:55:10,810
I'm embarrassed.

1911
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:37,750
Yeah, I'm gonna get rid of monkey.

1912
01:55:38,850 --> 01:55:39,730
Goodbye monkey.

1913
01:55:43,550 --> 01:55:44,330
That's true.

1914
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:46,530
It took me a really long time to record this song.

1915
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:37,400
I'm in the chat.

1916
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:52,460
I'm so embarrassed.

1917
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:10,850
I heard it literally yesterday.

1918
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:16,250
Like last night I heard it.

1919
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:17,490
The cover.

1920
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:24,800
A few

1921
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:36,070
things.

1922
01:57:38,510 --> 01:57:39,110
Presents.

1923
01:57:43,190 --> 01:57:44,450
Did you like it?

1924
01:57:46,210 --> 01:57:49,310
It's hard to say because I love the Kotoko version so much.

1925
01:57:50,290 --> 01:57:52,030
I hope everybody else likes it though.

1926
01:58:00,910 --> 01:58:01,290
What?

1927
01:58:01,370 --> 01:58:01,830
We're in a preview?

1928
01:58:04,030 --> 01:58:04,410
No!

1929
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:40,660
Here, I'm gonna move this up here.

1930
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:55,340
I'm sorry.

1931
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:05,910
It's funny because I really don't know Kassen's theme very much at all.

1932
01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:08,230
But I love this song so much.

1933
01:59:24,630 --> 01:59:26,670
They stopped it right before the chorus.

1934
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:31,090
The tease.

1935
01:59:31,730 --> 01:59:33,190
I was ready to jam out.

1936
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:34,690
The chorus is so hard.

1937
01:59:42,730 --> 01:59:43,570
Thank you.

1938
01:59:57,150 --> 01:59:58,830
Thank you.

1939
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:12,300
BGM present.

1940
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:14,280
On the 8th.

1941
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:16,740
As soon as I get back from Japan.

1942
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:21,740
I'm gonna be so jet lagged.

1943
02:00:40,580 --> 02:00:42,480
I'm trying to listen to the Touhou stream.

1944
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:43,420
Can you please keep it down?

1945
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:43,980
Oh sorry.

1946
02:01:12,530 --> 02:01:13,390
That's me.

1947
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:19,270
I'm a ghost maid.

1948
02:01:19,490 --> 02:01:20,510
Virtual YouTuber.

1949
02:01:21,890 --> 02:01:24,210
I play through a variety of games.

1950
02:01:24,350 --> 02:01:25,010
It's true.

1951
02:01:27,170 --> 02:01:29,330
And my favorite Touhou characters.

1952
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:42,530
I stream on YouTube.

1953
02:01:42,790 --> 02:01:44,010
I'm streaming right now.

1954
02:01:58,640 --> 02:01:59,880
Yeah, that's me.

1955
02:02:00,220 --> 02:02:01,220
Maid Mint CH.

1956
02:02:11,410 --> 02:02:13,270
Someone said you look punchable.

1957
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:20,160
I'll punch them.

1958
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:29,730
Special live stream.

1959
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:31,190
On the 8th.

1960
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:32,890
I'm gonna be so jet lagged.

1961
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:39,200
I'm gonna be so jet lagged.

1962
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:54,200
Yeah, I'm streaming right now.

1963
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:02,140
I'm streaming right now.

1964
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,280
Do they know?

1965
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:14,940
I don't think so.

1966
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:17,500
I don't think so.

1967
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:23,900
I don't think they know.

1968
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:24,740
Do they know?

1969
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:27,880
Wait, is this true?

1970
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:28,800
You're streaming right now?

1971
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:36,980
Jet stream.

1972
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:40,880
More stuff!

1973
02:03:56,850 --> 02:03:58,910
You can get the Mint Phantom signature.

1974
02:03:59,490 --> 02:04:03,710
Actually, I'll be going to their offices and signing them when I'm over there.

1975
02:04:22,710 --> 02:04:30,810
Log in 14 days and reply to the campaign post with the screenshot hashtag LWMint.

1976
02:04:32,090 --> 02:04:34,450
For a chance to win a signature.

1977
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:37,150
Or Fumo?

1978
02:04:42,510 --> 02:04:43,390
Hashtag.

1979
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:53,350
LW risk.

1980
02:05:04,970 --> 02:05:06,770
There you go.

1981
02:05:07,410 --> 02:05:08,830
You can take it anytime.

1982
02:05:14,290 --> 02:05:15,490
Oh, Blue Sky.

1983
02:05:17,630 --> 02:05:19,830
They don't have a Blue Sky account yet.

1984
02:05:19,830 --> 02:05:19,910
What?

1985
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:30,350
I think a lot of Touhou fans went to Blue Sky though because apparently ZUN got banned off of Twitter or something.

1986
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:38,600
So a lot of Touhou fans went to...

1987
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:41,420
Went to Blue Sky because of it.

1988
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:43,240
What?

1989
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:43,600
Why?

1990
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:44,240
I don't know.

1991
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:45,320
It's just random.

1992
02:05:47,780 --> 02:05:51,840
It's funny because my friend, she also got banned off of Twitter.

1993
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:55,420
She's like, I never know what you're doing anymore.

1994
02:05:56,140 --> 02:05:56,760
I don't have Twitter.

1995
02:06:04,850 --> 02:06:06,050
Someone said hacked.

1996
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:14,770
New Year's giveaway login bonus.

1997
02:06:14,770 --> 02:06:16,810
What is this?

1998
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:25,360
Cute.

1999
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:38,620
Yeah, I got a custom URL on Blue Sky.

2000
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:39,820
Let's set that up.

2001
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:44,840
But I'm so bad about posting multiple things.

2002
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:49,960
And I tried setting up a thing that would help me cross post at the same time.

2003
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:52,800
And it didn't work at all.

2004
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,300
So I was like, oh, okay.

2005
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:58,860
I'll just figure it out eventually.

2006
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:01,520
I'll figure it out eventually.

2007
02:07:03,180 --> 02:07:04,520
Yeah, I did try though.

2008
02:07:04,580 --> 02:07:05,340
I did try.

2009
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:10,380
And it's hard to leave Twitter.

2010
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:17,800
I'm like, I still have like a copium that'll maybe go back to being good again.

2011
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:21,280
Eventually, maybe.

2012
02:07:29,070 --> 02:07:34,310
I like how

2013
02:07:40,670 --> 02:07:45,070
their chat is just actual YouTube chat.

2014
02:07:47,590 --> 02:07:51,090
The chat that they have on their stream is just YouTube chat.

2015
02:07:52,070 --> 02:07:53,770
Twitter is where the idols are.

2016
02:07:53,870 --> 02:07:54,450
I know!

2017
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:10,070
Vanilla chat experience.

2018
02:08:10,410 --> 02:08:11,470
That's the chat I use.

2019
02:08:11,630 --> 02:08:12,210
What do you mean?

2020
02:08:12,750 --> 02:08:19,790
Just Google chat, YouTube chat CSS, and you'll find ones that you can semi-customize for free.

2021
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:27,200
You don't have to use just the YouTube box.

2022
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:33,440
Here, hold on.

2023
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:33,860
I'll do it.

2024
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:35,280
I can link you one right now.

2025
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:38,880
YouTube chat CSS.

2026
02:08:40,620 --> 02:08:40,940
Here.

2027
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:43,700
This one is a really popular one.

2028
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:45,500
There you go.

2029
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:47,860
You're welcome!

2030
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:02,690
Where is the other one?

2031
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:04,330
Oh, this one is the other one that I've used before.

2032
02:09:08,990 --> 02:09:11,270
That's another one that I've used before.

2033
02:09:12,750 --> 02:09:14,510
I've seen other people use it before.

2034
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:26,090
Well guys, I'm gonna go to sleep.

2035
02:09:26,510 --> 02:09:27,870
Actually, no, I can't go to sleep.

2036
02:09:28,630 --> 02:09:29,830
I have to pack.

2037
02:09:30,310 --> 02:09:33,770
Oh gosh, I have to pack, I have to do, I have to clean.

2038
02:09:34,730 --> 02:09:35,970
I have so much to do!

2039
02:09:36,690 --> 02:09:37,590
Thanks for the roulette!

2040
02:09:38,370 --> 02:09:41,650
I'm going to commission you cosplaying Kasen in Otter Recover.

2041
02:09:42,110 --> 02:09:42,910
So happy for you.

2042
02:09:42,970 --> 02:09:44,950
Have fun in Japan and say hi to Ayami Mama for us.

2043
02:09:45,210 --> 02:09:45,750
I will!

2044
02:09:46,130 --> 02:09:47,290
I will, I will, I will.

2045
02:09:48,650 --> 02:09:49,870
I will, I will, I will.

2046
02:09:49,970 --> 02:09:51,510
Congratulations again on the calamity.

2047
02:09:52,090 --> 02:09:52,690
Thank you!

2048
02:09:54,310 --> 02:09:56,770
Since we're just chilling here for a second...

2049
02:09:59,770 --> 02:10:00,430
Here we go.

2050
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:07,640
Have a good trip and make sure, well, make some good memories, Minky.

2051
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:08,980
See you in the new year.

2052
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:09,440
P.S.

2053
02:10:09,460 --> 02:10:12,120
I think Ria P's song with Polka must have gotten auto-flagged or something.

2054
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:14,940
I noticed that too, that it got taken down.

2055
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:15,800
I'm so sad.

2056
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:21,320
But I hope you guys have a wonderful new year.

2057
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:24,860
And thanks for hanging out with me today.

2058
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:28,480
Even though it was a little bit shorter than usual and everything.

2059
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:29,380
Safe travels, Minto.

2060
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:31,600
Hope you have a great time in Japan.

2061
02:10:32,660 --> 02:10:34,000
Try not to go too crazy.

2062
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:35,620
Oh, we'll try not to go too crazy.

2063
02:10:35,820 --> 02:10:36,600
Yeah, please.

2064
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:38,680
Hot dog.

2065
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:41,360
Have a safe flight.

2066
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:41,980
Fun trip.

2067
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:42,780
Thank you!

2068
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:44,620
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2069
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:47,740
Congrats on the collab.

2070
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:48,580
ZUN collab win.

2071
02:10:48,660 --> 02:10:49,380
You know...

2072
02:10:49,380 --> 02:10:51,240
Wait, I can't say that.

2073
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:51,700
Sorry.

2074
02:10:53,980 --> 02:10:57,800
They did say that they will probably show ZUN my cover.

2075
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:02,500
Because they have done so for other covers before in the past.

2076
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:06,440
Which scares me.

2077
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:16,420
Which means ZUN will know of my existence.

2078
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:19,220
That's so crazy.

2079
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:20,260
Wow.

2080
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,480
But I'm gonna miss you guys.

2081
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:28,000
I'll miss you guys.

2082
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:29,480
I'll try to post lots.

2083
02:11:30,420 --> 02:11:31,740
At least on Twitter.

2084
02:11:31,980 --> 02:11:33,780
I'll try to post more on Blue Sky.

2085
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:35,760
I think I'm logged in on there on my phone.

2086
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:41,380
But you guys be good.

2087
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:45,100
Don't cause so much mischief.

2088
02:11:48,340 --> 02:11:50,680
Don't... Don't... Don't become too freaky.

2089
02:11:50,820 --> 02:11:51,300
I don't know.

2090
02:11:51,940 --> 02:11:54,100
I mean, yes, be freaky, but like...

2091
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:03,680
Take care, have fun.

2092
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:08,060
Yeah, I'm only gonna be gone for like a week and a half, so...

2093
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:09,100
It's not so long.

2094
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:10,960
Have a really new year, Minky!

2095
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:12,800
Thank you!

2096
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:14,440
Thanks, Kayvon!

2097
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:19,740
To use... To use your words, you are the best ever.

2098
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,880
What are you talking about?

2099
02:12:21,620 --> 02:12:22,480
No child support.

2100
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:23,180
Stop it!

2101
02:12:24,820 --> 02:12:26,320
Child support is due next month.

2102
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:26,620
No!

2103
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:28,440
See you next year.

2104
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:29,500
See you next year!

2105
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:33,880
We'll survive.

2106
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:35,060
Yeah.

2107
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,040
Party at the maid cafe.

2108
02:12:39,240 --> 02:12:39,440
No!

2109
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:43,140
You have to keep it tidy!

2110
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:47,480
She's leaving for bilk.

2111
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:54,480
I... I... I didn't ask for this.

2112
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:56,500
I didn't ask for this.

2113
02:12:56,560 --> 02:12:58,340
I'm not ready for this responsibility.

2114
02:12:58,340 --> 02:12:58,760
Responsibility!

2115
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:02,740
But, yeah.

2116
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:05,320
I don't know what to say.

2117
02:13:05,820 --> 02:13:06,920
I'll miss you guys.

2118
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:12,340
Contrary to popular belief, I like streaming.

2119
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:23,040
Thanks, Fireflies!

2120
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:25,280
Here's to... To...

2121
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:27,560
Here's to a great 2025.

2122
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:28,180
Yeah!

2123
02:13:29,180 --> 02:13:30,840
Oh my gosh.

2124
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:35,440
We don't have much left of 2024, so...

2125
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:39,200
But I know that 2025 will be so, so great.

2126
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:44,040
Lots of things already planned.

2127
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:50,940
And we're starting off already with a bang with Toho last words, so...

2128
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:52,640
It's pretty exciting, I think.

2129
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:56,300
I'll see you guys when I get back.

2130
02:14:00,220 --> 02:14:01,800
I'll see you guys when I get back.

2131
02:14:04,580 --> 02:14:05,760
And I will be back.

2132
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:06,900
I'll be back.

2133
02:14:06,980 --> 02:14:07,480
I'll be back.

2134
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:08,660
Last hot dog of the year.

2135
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:09,800
There it is!

2136
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:13,080
There it is.

2137
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:15,040
Wed 3 for 2025.

2138
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:16,460
Be on the lookout.

2139
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:17,720
Thank you!

2140
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:18,560
Thank you for the hot dogs!

2141
02:14:18,740 --> 02:14:20,280
Have a good trip!

2142
02:14:20,380 --> 02:14:20,880
See you next year!

2143
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:21,700
See you next year!

2144
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:24,280
Can you do the stream again?

2145
02:14:25,200 --> 02:14:25,540
Alright.

2146
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:27,800
One more time!

2147
02:14:33,860 --> 02:14:34,420
Monkey!

2148
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:36,500
Bye bye!

2149
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:38,000
Otsumito!

2150
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:39,660
See you next year!

2151
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:40,840
Bye bye!

2152
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:43,100
Have a safe and fun new year!

2153
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:44,980
Bye bye!

2154
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:47,780
Bye bye!
