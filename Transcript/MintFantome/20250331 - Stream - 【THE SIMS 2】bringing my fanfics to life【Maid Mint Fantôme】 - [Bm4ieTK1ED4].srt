1
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,080
Welcome back, master and princess!

2
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,740
I don't know if the game is...

3
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,800
It's like a square.

4
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,200
Is it supposed to...

5
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,660
Should I crop it?

6
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,480
I don't...

7
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,980
I don't know.

8
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,360
I can't figure it out.

9
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,360
I don't know if it will get bigger when we play or not.

10
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,360
I can't tell.

11
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,610
I can't tell.

12
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,870
I think it's supposed to be like that.

13
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,910
It's supposed to be like that in the menu.

14
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,290
It'll be widescreen once we...

15
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,430
Okay, okay, okay.

16
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,050
You can totally tell that I...

17
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,290
tested this out like a...

18
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,410
like a professional would, right?

19
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,630
I'm a professional.

20
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,210
Anyway, welcome guys to The Sims 2.

21
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,010
I hope you are having a good weekend.

22
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,410
I...

23
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,270
got my dinner.

24
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,270
So I'm gonna...

25
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,890
Sorry.

26
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,390
I went and got it kind of last minute.

27
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,410
So I have...

28
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:16,690
a salad.

29
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:16,830
Salad.

30
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,230
I'm really enjoying the Peace Walker streams.

31
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,510
Thank you, George!

32
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,830
I have a salad.

33
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:32,510
Today.

34
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,890
I'm gonna try eating it at this very moment.

35
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,640
Fix the audio?

36
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,220
What's wrong with the audio?

37
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,360
What are you talking about?

38
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,660
It's okay?

39
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,940
I think maybe, buddy, you got a second tab open.

40
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,860
Are you sure it's...

41
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,480
Are you sure it's...

42
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,980
It's me?

43
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,270
What's going on?

44
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,490
Tomato.

45
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,470
I'm getting One Guide.

46
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,650
I don't know.

47
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,440
Classic One Guide.

48
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,680
Stop the voices in my head.

49
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,100
I can't do anything about that for you.

50
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,020
Because I'm supposed to deal with my in-head voices too?

51
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,100
Huh?

52
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,160
Huh?

53
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,140
Started Astro Ball yesterday.

54
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,740
I hope you like it!

55
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,610
It's your birthday?

56
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,110
Happy birthday, SoulSmug!

57
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,690
Let me sing a happy birthday.

58
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,030
I thought the game I was playing had horrible echo music earlier, but I had two instances of it open.

59
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,670
That happens to me sometimes too.

60
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,330
I'll be like, what's wrong with this person's stream?

61
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,490
And it's because I'm obsessed with them and I just...

62
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,390
I couldn't wait.

63
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,670
I had to have every tab be them and then they all started at the...

64
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:38,330
Like, they start at like the same time, but like...

65
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,550
Slightly different, right?

66
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,210
So it's like, one started before the other.

67
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,330
And so it's just like a little...

68
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,370
Wait,

69
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,570
let me sing you a happy birthday first.

70
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,310
Let me sing you a happy birthday first, SoulSmug.

71
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,870
Happy birthday to you!

72
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,330
Happy birthday to you!

73
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,070
Happy birthday, dear SoulSmug!

74
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,850
Happy birthday to you!

75
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,410
Happy birthday!

76
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,510
Thank you so much for the five gifts.

77
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,190
Thank you!

78
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,250
And Vijay!

79
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,450
Thank you for the five gifts.

80
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,760
I hope you're okay.

81
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,670
Someone sent me a video, not too long ago.

82
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,830
Of the Chocolate Rain guy.

83
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,210
And he's streaming, but there's like something...

84
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,390
It's like causing his audio to loop.

85
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,590
And then by the end... He's playing like Team Fortress or something.

86
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,270
Thank you for the five gifts.

87
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,110
And Drago, thank you for the 20 gifts.

88
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,310
Can't stay long tonight, thanks for streaming though.

89
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,670
Thank you for being here!

90
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,830
The video's a classic?

91
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,870
I've never seen it before.

92
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,110
So funny.

93
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,750
Oh my gosh.

94
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,990
Gotta look it up.

95
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,750
What's that guy's name?

96
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,370
Chocolate Rain Man.

97
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,390
I meant Y2.

98
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,410
Why The Sims 2?

99
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,490
So, okay.

100
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,530
Let me get into it too.

101
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,710
Because some people are like, wow Minto, you tried playing The Sims before.

102
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,350
And it was a disaster.

103
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,130
And you're trying again?

104
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,310
You're really giving them another chance?

105
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,130
You're giving... It's EA, right?

106
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,830
You're giving them a second chance?

107
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,970
Well apparently...

108
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,010
They...

109
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,790
Which fixes it.

110
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,670
But also...

111
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,210
I was... I don't know.

112
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,910
I think it's because if I tried playing The Sims 1 again.

113
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,630
Because I had such a stinky time with it.

114
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,030
I was just like...

115
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,370
Maybe we'll just switch it up a little bit.

116
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,050
So...

117
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,190
And it seems to be working.

118
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,790
Because Nimi has been playing The Sims 2.

119
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,110
And she's able to play it.

120
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,930
So I was like...

121
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,130
Well...

122
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,510
Maybe it's okay.

123
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,240
Maybe.

124
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,880
Maybe I just have bad luck.

125
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,640
Who knows.

126
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,540
I mean, that's true.

127
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,400
I'm not one of God's favorite children.

128
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,020
That's why I was kicked out of heaven.

129
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,000
Not kicked out.

130
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,560
I left.

131
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,800
But you know...

132
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,200
Wait, she did break it?

133
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,910
But like...

134
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,390
How recent?

135
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,110
How recent is that?

136
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,200
Like two months ago?

137
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,180
Oh, that is before the patch then.

138
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,480
That's before the patch.

139
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,780
The patch is kind of recent.

140
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,920
Pretty sure.

141
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,840
Anyway.

142
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,260
Sorry, I'm eating my salad.

143
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,040
I'm eating my salad.

144
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,320
And then we're going to start.

145
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,000
That's a pretty big salad.

146
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,860
Where should we...

147
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,560
Where should we go?

148
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,000
Should we become normal?

149
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,300
And just live in Pleasant View?

150
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,040
I did not know...

151
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,240
That there's like lore and stuff in Strangetown.

152
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,220
Recently, I've been on like Sims TikTok.

153
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And I'm learning about like...

154
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,580
The mothership.

155
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,520
And all this stuff that makes the Sims in the town become zombies.

156
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
Wait, the cafe is not in heaven?

157
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,600
No.

158
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,600
It's in... No.

159
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
It never has been.

160
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,660
Wondering Taco!

161
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,060
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

162
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,760
Thank you!

163
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,040
There's Sims lore?

164
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,680
Yes!

165
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,960
Oh my gosh.

166
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,800
Oh my gosh, Bella Goth lore goes crazy!

167
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,180
So crazy.

168
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,760
I recommend you guys doing like a deep dive on it.

169
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,860
Because it's actually really fascinating.

170
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,220
Because, oh my gosh, it gives me like...

171
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,540
It gives me like...

172
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,220
Okay, this is going to sound really stupid though.

173
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,380
But you know how like in Five Nights at Freddy's...

174
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,880
They don't like explain the lore to you in your face?

175
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,800
Like you kind of have to read it through like...

176
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,660
It's like...

177
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,660
You read it through like the newspaper clippings on the wall.

178
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,000
And things like that.

179
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
And it's like that.

180
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,460
Where you like kind of read things.

181
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,020
Because of how like they're like...

182
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,600
Oh, who is in this person's graveyard?

183
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,160
Or like what does their bio say?

184
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,120
And things like that.

185
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,660
Like it's very...

186
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,860
Passive storytelling.

187
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,340
Yes!

188
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:13,640
Yes!

189
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,080
Yes!

190
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,860
Very in between the lines.

191
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,460
So it's actually really cool.

192
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,200
I like that.

193
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,100
It's like my favorite kind of storytelling.

194
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,960
Dark Souls?

195
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,500
Dark Souls is like that too?

196
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,280
No way.

197
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,620
She's my Sim's wife.

198
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,100
I love the Bella Goth lore.

199
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,410
Interesting.

200
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,420
I thought you liked Exposition a la Metal Gear Solid.

201
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,740
I like when things are...

202
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,140
Well, okay.

203
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,660
Maybe...

204
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,280
Let me back up.

205
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,460
It is my favorite type of storytelling in horror.

206
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,340
So like because this is kind of like...

207
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,780
It's with Bella Goth and stuff.

208
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,360
It's a little like creepy.

209
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,400
It's my favorite kind of like...

210
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,800
You know, and then FNAF is also a horror game.

211
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,400
So it's like...

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,380
My favorite kind of storytelling in like a...

213
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,540
Creepy...

214
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,880
Way.

215
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,800
You know?

216
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,280
We're just like...

217
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,740
Spooky.

218
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,340
I love subtle horror.

219
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,800
I don't know.

220
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,860
Okay, let's go to Strangetown.

221
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,520
Strangetown.

222
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,220
Gosh, this whole interface is so nostalgic.

223
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,940
I played the most out of The Sims 2.

224
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,260
So...

225
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,160
Fushigi.

226
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,280
It has environmental storytelling.

227
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,140
The cassettes.

228
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:03,760
Yeah.

229
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,640
Maybe not quite the same.

230
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,000
But you could play the whole game and never...

231
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:15,960
Well...

232
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,200
You have to listen to some of them.

233
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,020
But you could play the whole game and...

234
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,260
Not listen to all of them.

235
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,860
I'm amazing.

236
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,260
Thanks, Young Riles.

237
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,480
Thanks for 11 months.

238
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,260
Creating hobbies.

239
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,980
We're creating magic!

240
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,380
No way.

241
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,500
No way.

242
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,680
This is too...

243
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,420
This is too cool.

244
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,240
We're creating...

245
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,660
Nothing.

246
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,240
Alien!

247
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,620
Oh my gosh.

248
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,400
So nostalgic.

249
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,460
I

250
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,650
love The Sims 2!

251
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,450
Apartment life.

252
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,370
Too real.

253
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,290
Mansion and garden stuff.

254
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,260
I think the alien invasion might spell ruin for the town.

255
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,040
You guys!

256
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,920
I wasn't making it up.

257
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,240
It's real.

258
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,120
It's real.

259
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,880
Real lore.

260
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,300
Oh my gosh.

261
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,320
I love that show.

262
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,700
I used to watch that show everyday with my grandma.

263
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,240
With the guy who was on Star Trek.

264
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,140
He hosted it.

265
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,040
Beyond Belief, Fact or Fiction.

266
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,640
And now it's like a meme.

267
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,480
It's so funny.

268
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,520
I used to love that show.

269
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,140
We made it up.

270
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,420
Jonathan Frakes!

271
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:14,700
Yes!

272
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,420
My grandma loved that show so much.

273
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,780
In Strangetown, nothing is what it seems.

274
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,680
What are the different pictures?

275
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,600
Oh!

276
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,540
In search of truth and mystery.

277
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,900
The Three Curious Brothers.

278
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:43,750
Pascal, Vitkund, and Lazlo got more than they were...

279
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,590
I was expecting.

280
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,850
They really become...

281
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,790
I thought...

282
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,410
They were maybe...

283
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,270
They...

284
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,790
End prank?

285
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:56,370
Okay.

286
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:08,080
Can they cope with their new roles as cosmic parents?

287
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,700
After...

288
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,040
Oh my god.

289
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,460
Alien.

290
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:18,480
After a fruitful career, Pollination Technician 9 has retired to his favorite planet.

291
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,180
But can his son Johnny make friends and fit in?

292
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,280
Or is this family just too strange for Strangetown?

293
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,520
What experiments are the highly secretive and less than neighborly Loki and Cersei?

294
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,880
Performing on poor Nervous Subject.

295
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,040
Is that his name, Nervous Subject?

296
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,680
Wow.

297
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,600
Would you guys like it if I called you that?

298
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,700
Hey there, Nervous Subject.

299
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,360
Are you ready for today's experiment?

300
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,420
Today we're...

301
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,760
Dunking your feet in hot water.

302
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,420
Yeah.

303
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,040
Will this secrecy affect Cersei's career ambitions?

304
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,900
What does she want to do?

305
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,500
She wants to...

306
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,800
She wants to get promoted.

307
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,320
Tank has always lived under the hard thumb of his father, General Buzz Grunt.

308
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,200
In this domesticated boot camp, can Tank prove his worth to his demanding dad?

309
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,360
There are so many people here.

310
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,880
Nervous Wisps, rise up!

311
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,340
Who is buried in Olive Specter's garden?

312
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,540
Will the mysterious aging outcast leave her fortune to her niece Ophelia?

313
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,620
Or as rumored, to an unnamed heir.

314
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,280
She's in love with a zombie.

315
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,440
I think we're going to have our own family today.

316
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,220
How do I zoom out?

317
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:47,580
There we go.

318
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,080
Wow, strange town.

319
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,660
Is this some prime real estate right here or what?

320
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,180
Wait, whose house is this?

321
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,560
Welcome to membership.

322
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,480
Thank you.

323
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,240
Oh, this is the...

324
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,640
This is the weirdo Beaker family.

325
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,760
I think we should...

326
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,600
build our own family.

327
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,220
And meet all these crazy fellas.

328
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,340
What do you guys think?

329
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,640
I think we should have a Curious.

330
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,060
The Curious family.

331
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,960
Oh, it's the guys!

332
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,280
Where's your baby?

333
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,300
Wait, can I go see them real quick?

334
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,520
I just want to look.

335
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,560
Which one's pregnant, is what I'm wondering.

336
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,380
My bets are on Lazlo.

337
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,620
I don't know who...

338
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,400
Oh, oh.

339
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,180
Sims have aspirations.

340
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,060
Let me get a little bit smaller for this, I think.

342
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,060
Let's move like here.

343
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,980
That should be good.

344
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,520
You, you're pregnant?

345
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,820
Unlock new rewards.

346
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,520
I think I'll be able to remember pretty easily...

347
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,580
how to do this.

348
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,140
Oh my goodness.

349
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,900
Oh, thank goodness he doesn't want to woohoo.

350
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,660
I feel like all the...

351
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,620
Alien!

352
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,320
Wait, is none of them pregnant?

353
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,480
Um, no.

354
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,510
It happened in front of me!

355
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,010
What?

356
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,220
Which one?

357
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,660
Oh, it wasn't Lazlo.

358
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,740
It was...

359
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,560
What the hell is this?

360
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,080
What is this show?

361
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,500
It's a horror!

362
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,200
How did he...

363
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,480
How did he get pregnant?

364
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,920
Wait, what's the controls here?

365
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,240
Oh gosh, it doesn't tell me.

366
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,940
You guys, shut up.

367
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,400
You're watching the TV.

368
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,560
Okay.

369
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,600
What is happening?

370
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,720
But he wants to meet aliens.

371
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,160
That's his big aspiration.

372
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,100
It's so loud.

373
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,100
Turn it down!

374
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,560
Turn it off.

375
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,540
You don't need to watch this anymore.

376
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,400
Well...

377
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,240
Oh my gosh.

378
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,680
Wait, what does Pascal want?

379
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
He wants to...

380
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,760
No, turn it off!

381
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,000
Someone gets pregnant sounds about right.

382
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,820
Look, they have their little crib ready and everything.

383
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,120
Go relax, pregnant man.

384
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,720
You're okay.

385
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,020
Go relax.

386
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,480
Go relax.

387
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,840
Oh, you need to pee.

388
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,980
Oh, that's not a...

389
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,080
That's not...

390
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,760
I gotta get used to...

391
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,800
They didn't flush?

392
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,940
I like how their beds are...

393
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,400
Oh, there's technically two different rooms.

394
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,980
I was gonna say their beds are touching.

395
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,400
I don't think this is his room, maybe.

396
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,320
Do we say congratulations?

397
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,260
I wanna see the baby.

398
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,420
I want to see the baby.

399
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,680
Oh, he flushed.

400
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,080
Good job.

401
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,760
Okay, he also has to pee.

402
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,180
Everybody go to the bathroom.

403
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,600
Oh, he has to...

404
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
He has to pee the most.

405
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,420
Guys...

406
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,280
How do we do the cheats?

407
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,280
How do we do the cheats, guys?

408
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,340
Is he just sniffing the pizza?

409
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,880
Hey, that's so rude!

410
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,600
Don't watch him pee.

411
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,980
No, no.

412
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,580
Go pee.

413
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,100
Go pee.

414
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,620
He's unhappy because he's not peeing.

415
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,160
Eat the pizza.

416
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,400
How long do you think it will take for him to...

417
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,540
Okay, I'm gonna fast forward.

418
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,800
And we're just gonna wait for the baby to be born.

419
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,520
We'll let them do their own thing.

420
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,680
We'll let them have free will.

421
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,460
And the baby will be born.

422
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,620
And then...

423
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,460
We can see the little alien baby.

424
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,620
Do you think it will have his eyes or...

425
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,540
Oh, it's on the floor!

426
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,040
It's so...

427
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,130
What's happening?

428
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,950
Something is supposed to be happening.

429
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,650
Wait, what's going on?

430
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,790
It's broken?

431
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,870
What's going on?

432
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,450
What's happening?

433
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,140
There's no baby!

434
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,220
It's cut to nothing!

435
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,260
The

436
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,120
bouncing baby needs a name.

437
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,620
Minto.

438
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,800
Look, it looks just like me actually.

439
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,080
Oh, nevermind.

440
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,980
I think I lied.

441
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,220
Anyway...Oh, who the hell are you?

442
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,220
Oh my gosh, why are you in your nervous subject?

443
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,200
When did you get here?

444
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,260
He came to yippy at the baby and then leaves.

445
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,300
What are you doing in our house?

446
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,520
What are you doing here?

447
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,240
Where are you going?

448
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,500
He's going upstairs again.

449
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,240
No, he's going downstairs.

450
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,920
Why didn't you just exit through the front door?

451
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,280
Is there a front door?

452
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,120
Yes!

453
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,280
He came over just to go woohoo at the baby.

454
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,400
And now he's going home.

455
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,410
Bye!

456
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,300
He needed to get his steps in.

457
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,960
Where did he come from?

458
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,780
Why was he here?

459
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,200
I know he wants to have a talk with him, but...

460
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,140
We're going to leave now.

461
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,040
Thank you very much every...oh not quit.

462
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,820
Go back to the neighborhood.

463
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,080
Yes, that was exciting.

464
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,780
Now we just witnessed a birth.

465
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,000
It hasn't even been a half hour.

466
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,340
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

467
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,540
Thank you!

468
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,860
Now everybody...

469
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,520
It's time for the grand creation.

470
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,540
We can have a family of just pets.

471
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,470
I like this.

472
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,630
Wait.

473
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:22,670
Critter.

474
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:28,450
In a world full of conflict, who knew that these two would fall so deeply in puppy love?

475
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:38,090
Despite being homeless, Danny and Sarah have stuck together throughout the years.

476
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,770
But Sarah wants a better life for their future little ones.

477
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,530
So they're looking for a good home to settle down.

478
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,050
My goodness.

479
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,770
And we also have...oh wait, the singles.

480
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,530
OK, but we're making a new family.

481
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,740
Those dogs have 200 simoleons.

482
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,600
What's our family name?

483
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,570
I'm going to make the Cheesy family.

484
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,490
And that's their motto.

485
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,730
It ain't easy being a Cheesy.

486
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,530
You know?

487
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,530
Because this guy is Chucky Cheesy.

488
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,670
He is...what is this?

489
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,390
A cat.

490
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,270
Wow, Chucky Cheesy!

491
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,530
Wait!

492
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,090
I could actually make...

493
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,690
Wait, can I actually make Butaro?

494
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,510
Wait, can I customize him?

495
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,150
OK, hold on.

496
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,090
No, he's like...OK, so Butaro is like...

497
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,990
Light brown...

498
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,850
Wait, I want to add some extra stuff.

499
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,610
Oh, like this, like this.

500
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,330
Oh, it's backwards.

501
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:14,910
Wait.

502
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,810
OK, that's brown.

503
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,090
And then...

504
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,190
No!

505
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,370
Oh, so cute.

506
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,970
No, it's got to be...it's opposite for my cat.

507
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:34,010
My cat is totally brown except little patches.

508
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,610
Add a new layer.

509
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,410
Oh, wait, wait.

510
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,730
Oh, I see how it works now.

511
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,510
I didn't have ever any of like the mods and things, so...

512
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,030
This is all new for me, you guys.

513
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,030
Wait, what?

514
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:50,930
What?

515
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:58,970
Oh my God, he's starting to look more like my cat.

516
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,610
I'm Chucky Cheesy.

517
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,970
Chucky Cheesy.

518
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,570
How do I change it though?

519
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,590
White back...

520
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,290
My cat is really brown.

521
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,750
He used to be not so brown.

522
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:19,950
Now he's turned brown.

523
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,510
I can even set the opacity.

524
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,390
This is crazy.

525
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,210
Choose a coat pattern.

526
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,190
Like that.

527
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,250
Oh, it's so cute.

528
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,330
But brown.

529
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:34,990
OK.

530
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,310
And this is like a light brown.

531
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,090
No, this is dark brown.

532
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,770
It's his face.

533
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,710
Brown face.

534
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:46,850
Brown.

535
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,490
Everywhere brown.

536
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,650
Everywhere brown.

537
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,790
Oh my gosh, there's so much customization.

538
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,630
What the heck?

539
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,510
No, this is brown.

540
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,580
This is so crazy.

541
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,560
Why is it so detailed?

542
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,760
That's a fox?

543
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,520
No, that's my cat.

544
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,980
I changed his eye color.

545
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,840
Brown.

546
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:34,860
Brown.

547
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,160
No, it's still dark.

548
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,580
He doesn't have any booties.

549
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,350
This looks kind of like my cat.

550
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,250
It actually looks nothing like my cat.

551
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:53,770
Chucky Cheesy.

552
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,770
My cat is fascinated watching you make a cat.

553
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,970
What?

554
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,150
Orange cat?

555
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,410
He's so cute.

556
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,370
OK.

557
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,530
This is Chucky Cheesy.

558
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,610
Is

559
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,690
that OK?

560
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,010
We're gonna be...

561
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,950
We're gonna be an adult.

562
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:25,750
OK.

563
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,990
My cat meowed at your cat.

564
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,090
My cat meowed back.

565
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,030
OK, guys.

566
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,090
OK, guys.

567
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,030
Round face.

568
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,390
Wait,

569
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,460
I need to have a...

570
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,360
How big is my head?

571
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,070
Maybe I need the biggest head.

572
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,890
The Karen cut.

573
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,050
No, I can't change his style.

574
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,530
Guys, I'm gonna be a blonde.

575
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,450
Wait, hold on.

576
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,390
We're gonna... Wait.

577
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,890
This is kind of like...

578
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,230
It's even my colors!

579
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,370
Or should I be black hair?

580
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,050
Because I can be goth mint too.

581
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,230
No, I think... We'll be blonde for now.

582
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,570
We can always go white later.

583
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,890
What's my level of spice tolerance?

584
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,090
Like nothing.

585
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,390
Like zero.

586
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:46,450
Minus one.

587
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,530
Goth.

588
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,210
Look, it's even my colors.

589
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,890
Let's keep looking through though.

590
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,950
I have a question.

591
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,410
Like, can we...

592
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,410
Can you still get mods and stuff even for this?

593
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,010
But look at this one!

594
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,330
That could look like me.

595
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,370
I could be a ninja!

596
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:13,510
Ninja!

597
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,110
Mimmy modded hers?

598
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:17,770
Awesome.

599
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,550
Minky!

600
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:28,690
If I am like this, would my child be born with a little monkey head?

601
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,480
Questions.

602
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,850
Oh my god, when I would play The Sims, this is what I always put my hair as.

603
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,850
Because this is basically...

604
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:56,990
Basically, when I was a wee wisp, I wanted the same haircut as Buttercup from the Powerpuff Girls.

605
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,950
And so...

606
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,850
This was my haircut for like...

607
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,510
Way long.

608
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,620
So...

609
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,440
All because of Buttercup.

610
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,040
It's her birthday!

611
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,260
Hello.

612
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:25,740
Do I take shots of mango, pineapple, vodka, green apple crown, or peach brandy?

613
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,820
Mango pineapple.

614
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,340
I like mango.

615
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,800
Happy birthday to you.

616
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,000
Happy birthday to you.

617
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,860
Happy birthday dear Lauren.

618
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,820
Oh, Lauren's old.

619
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,880
Happy birthday to you.

620
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,220
Happy birthday!

621
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,080
Who did I say?

622
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,780
Who did I see say that?

623
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,880
Buttercup is the worst Powerpuff Girl.

624
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,860
Excuse me?

625
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,870
Buttercup was everything to me.

626
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,270
How could you say that?

627
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,910
How could you say that?

628
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,330
Factually incorrect.

629
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,130
The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.

630
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,530
They did a live performance of Raiders of the Lost Ark?

631
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,310
I don't want to go.

632
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,630
Do I have to go to Baltimore or do they...

633
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,070
Will they come to my house?

634
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,430
Why didn't you tell me?

635
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,070
I would have haunted.

636
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,290
Okay, let's be Minky.

637
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,290
Let's do pink Minky.

638
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,550
Clothes.

639
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,250
Oh, wait, no.

640
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,930
Oh, we have to choose.

641
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,630
That's right, this is our everyday look.

642
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,990
And for our fancy look...

643
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,220
I'm being denied Minky access, everybody.

644
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,060
This sucks.

645
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,780
Minky Minky.

646
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,900
Who is the worst Powerpuff Girl?

647
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,420
I don't think there is a worst one.

648
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,480
But if I had to say my least favorite, it would maybe be Blossom.

649
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,720
Probably now that I'm older...

650
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,500
Well, I was like a tomboy, so for me Buttercup was my favorite because I related to Mozart.

651
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,760
Now I think...

652
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,440
Now I think Bubbles might be my favorite.

653
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:51,930
Let's see.

654
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,830
What should we do for fancy hair?

655
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,590
What is this?

656
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,210
Oh, clown outfit.

657
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,510
What is this?

658
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,310
Oh, that's nice.

659
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:05,990
I didn't have any of the expansions when I used to play.

660
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,650
I didn't fumble chat.

661
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,010
I added her weeks ago.

662
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,490
Oh, real clown.

663
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,030
Oh, wow.

664
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:18,730
That's the actual hair.

665
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,650
Okay, perfect.

666
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,270
This is for fancy occasions.

667
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:26,030
And then this is for when I'm getting a little freaky.

668
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,100
This is for bedtime.

669
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,550
So always...

670
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,250
Guys, what if my Sim accidentally woohoo's?

671
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,730
Maybe I shouldn't make...

672
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,270
Wait, wait.

673
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,490
I can make... Wait.

674
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,890
What would the child look like?

675
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,090
I want to see the little baby Minky.

676
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,210
Accidental woohooing.

677
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,490
Wait, which is this one?

678
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,770
Oh, this is swimwear.

679
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,210
Swimwear would be...

680
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,310
What

681
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,030
the hell is this forehead?

682
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,410
Why does it look like it expands?

683
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:36,210
Wait, why does the head actually get bigger?

684
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,250
Wow.

685
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,110
Wow!

686
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,150
Holy cow!

687
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,010
Holy moly!

688
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,340
And then this is athlete.

689
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,940
This is when we're working out.

690
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,300
This is all very true, by the way.

691
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,600
Is this low-def?

692
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,920
There are no accidents.

693
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,200
Yeah, let me control this.

694
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,760
Athletic.

695
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,560
Why can't I only wear my Minky head when I'm...

696
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,180
During my everyday clothes?

697
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:16,960
I don't understand.

698
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,500
Why am I being denied access?

699
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,420
What's like a sporty cut?

700
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,280
Maybe we should do the hair...

701
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,700
Wait, what's the difference?

702
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,660
Oh, the colors.

703
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,700
We'll do green.

704
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,240
Yeah, we'll do green.

705
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,860
Wow, the largest... This is like actually... Don't raise your eyebrows.

706
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,080
Outerwear.

707
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:46,480
Perfect.

708
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:54,940
Let's see.

709
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,060
Let's try and find like a pretty round face.

710
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,360
This is kind of round.

711
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,650
Wait, are those ears?

712
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,570
Are those spiky ears?

713
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,930
It's me!

714
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,490
OK, but I gotta make the face rounder, I think.

715
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,070
I think I have brown cheeks, no?

716
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:30,830
Like...

717
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,640
Yeah.

718
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,800
Hold on, I'm comparing it.

719
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,420
I'm comparing it.

720
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,180
How close is this?

721
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,240
I can't see.

722
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,180
It's pretty close.

723
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,120
Spot on.

724
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,880
What's the difference?

725
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,180
I could make it bigger.

726
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,100
No, no.

727
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,440
We'll make it normal size.

728
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,320
We'll make it as it was.

729
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,160
And my ears?

730
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,460
Kind of smaller size, but you can't see them right now.

731
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,480
Hold on.

732
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,520
Stung by a bee?

733
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,360
What do you mean?

734
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,000
Hold on.

735
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,520
Hold on.

736
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,240
Hold on.

737
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:26,640
Hold on.

738
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,060
I need to do this without...

739
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,500
OK, it does kind of look like we're stung by...

740
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,340
Hold on!

741
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,320
No!

742
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,600
What?

743
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,380
It looks like that?

744
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,180
No.

745
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,480
This is...

746
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,040
No, see?

747
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,480
The cheeks are just not...

748
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,560
Look at my cheeks.

749
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,020
My cheeks are up here.

750
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,740
I like hearing the little cat.

751
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,340
So cute.

752
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,380
What if I do this?

753
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,490
Don't smile.

754
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,130
It's creepy.

755
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:12,910
Does that look better?

756
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,350
Oh wow, it's Minto.

757
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:17,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

758
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,790
Change the chin?

759
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,830
Oh, do you think the chin is the problem?

760
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,780
I have a pretty pointy chin.

761
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,620
I don't know if I have any...

762
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,360
I need to pull out my 3D reference for this.

763
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,300
Oh wait, here we go.

764
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

765
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

766
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:57,690
Is this a peanut?

767
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:57,850
Is this a peanut?

768
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,450
The forehead is too small.

769
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:08,070
We literally maxed it out.

770
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:09,470
Oh, these are eyebrows.

771
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,130
We're not there yet.

772
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,730
Maybe let's get this...

773
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:17,130
There we go.

774
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,150
Oh my gosh, wait.

775
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,250
It's looking better.

776
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

777
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,010
It's getting better.

778
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,710
Alright, let's go back.

779
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:31,150
Oh, whoops.

780
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:33,670
Let's put our minky back on.

781
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,650
Get your minky on.

782
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:36,890
Get your minky on.

783
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,290
That's not bad.

784
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:46,170
Store so much food for the winter?

785
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,000
Get your minky on.

786
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,360
Why are they so jagged though?

787
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,580
They have pretty thin eyebrows.

788
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,120
Oh, and I'm always like that.

789
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,060
Like that, like that.

790
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,110
We're getting there guys, one step at a time.

791
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,210
My big ol' blue eyes.

792
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,250
See?

793
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,570
It looks just like me.

794
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,060
Why is the face begging for mercy?

795
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,040
No!

796
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,400
My eyes a little...

797
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,540
They slope down.

798
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,360
No, no.

799
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,100
Not that.

800
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,460
I'm pinching those cheeks and pulling...

801
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,000
Stop!

802
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,320
Don't be weird.

803
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,280
Actually, I think just normal is fine.

804
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,500
Oh wait, no, here.

805
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:25,680
This one.

806
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,690
I see two minkys.

807
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,210
Yeah, you do.

808
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:32,290
You do.

809
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:46,300
I saw someone do a challenge where they kept trying to get their character's eyes as big as possible.

810
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,620
Like making each generation bigger and bigger and bigger.

811
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,020
This does work.

812
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,620
Nah, we'll go normal.

813
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,260
This is like...

814
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,280
This is the real...

815
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,240
What just happened?

816
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,560
Why did they go up?

817
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:06,920
I don't like that.

818
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,920
This is the real RTX, you guys.

819
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,360
Wait, why did they...

820
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,520
This just ruined everything.

821
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:15,420
No!

822
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:16,520
Wait, undo.

823
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:17,880
Okay, there we go.

824
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,620
That ruined everything for a second.

825
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,760
Yeah, I think...

826
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,340
Let's make them a little bit bigger.

827
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,500
Like that.

828
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,490
Her face rippled.

829
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,370
Why does she look so sad?

830
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,610
It's my default.

831
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:51,950
Maybe.

832
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:00,030
Okay, we gotta have a little dainty bitty nose.

833
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,110
Everybody knows...

834
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:07,950
That my nose is so small and delicate because everyone's always saying...

835
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:09,330
Where's your nose?

836
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:10,470
Look at that.

837
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:12,870
Look at that, look at that.

838
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:16,150
Everybody knows.

839
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,090
Okay, that one wasn't so difficult.

840
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,190
This one is gonna be tricky, I think.

841
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,210
Oh my gosh.

842
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:30,990
Wow.

843
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,050
I want a little Cupid's bow.

844
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:38,750
How do I make that?

845
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:43,550
Look at this.

846
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,690
She looks just like me, you know?

847
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,370
Suddenly it worked.

848
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:49,670
Suddenly it cues.

849
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:50,550
How did that happen?

850
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,490
Wow, plastic surgery is crazy.

851
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,070
And everyone was so great.

852
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,170
Thank you, Nervous J.

853
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,270
Thank you.

854
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,420
What does it look like without the hat?

855
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,660
Let's test it out.

856
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,440
Really?

857
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,360
This is just for... This is for freaky time.

858
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,300
When we're sleeping... Oh, hold on.

859
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,580
Let me give her some sleep hair.

860
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,380
When she's asleep...

861
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,900
I don't actually put my hair up when I sleep.

862
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,420
But we can do this because she's, you know...

863
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,900
A protective... You know how you can protect your hair when you sleep?

864
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,800
You guys like ponytails?

865
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:54,820
And

866
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,370
this is when she's working out.

867
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:00,990
Oh, no.

868
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:02,270
This is when she's working out.

869
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:03,410
This is when she's swimming.

870
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,270
She got some Ariana Grande extensions in.

871
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,130
She looks concerned.

872
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:21,920
No, she's okay.

873
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,920
I think we got it, guys.

874
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,040
I think we got it.

875
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,580
Oh, she needs makeup.

876
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,400
Oh, that's so thick.

877
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,720
Oh, this is the blush.

878
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,320
What do you call that?

879
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,820
The highlighter crazy.

880
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,780
I don't really have eyeshadow.

881
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,460
Oh, it's kind of dark.

882
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,900
We are in goth mode.

883
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,120
Maybe we go for a gothy look.

884
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,000
Maybe we go for a goth look.

885
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,520
Have you guys noticed I do have...

886
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:10,960
Oh, sorry.

887
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,720
I didn't realize it would stop the music.

888
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:13,980
Do you guys see?

889
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,600
You see my lips?

890
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,000
I do have a bit of gloss on.

891
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,180
You see it?

892
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,020
You see it?

893
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,060
It's shiny.

894
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,440
We need something to match that.

895
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:46,970
Really?

896
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:49,590
They don't have anything?

897
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:53,870
Everything is so bright.

898
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,030
Why is everything so bright?

899
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:01,570
Oh my god.

900
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:09,630
Show your lips really close and also get close to the mic, please.

901
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,120
Time to get mods.

902
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,120
For real, I've never done mods.

903
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,260
This one is not bad.

904
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,420
This one is not so bad.

905
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,900
I've never done mods with the Sims.

906
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:29,980
I'm scared.

907
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,440
Maybe we'll have to for next time.

908
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,820
Oh, mods for chat.

909
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,100
Chat mods.

910
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:52,830
This is an average Sunday, no?

911
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,580
You guys are just joking around.

912
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,430
Wait, what's this?

913
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:14,950
Wow, we have jewelry.

914
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:21,990
Guys, if you ever see me wearing earrings...

915
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,870
They're clip-ons.

916
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:29,970
If you ever see me wearing jewelry, it's clip-on earrings.

917
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:31,610
I don't have my ears pierced.

918
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:43,010
Bracelet.

919
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,750
A little butterfly.

920
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,380
We're going for a gothy look.

921
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,060
None of these are gothy at all.

922
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,620
This one I like.

923
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,120
We'll go for that.

924
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,080
It's very anime.

925
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:12,610
What are you saying?

926
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,210
Right there?

927
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,110
There's like nothing there.

928
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,330
The gold is nice.

929
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:24,410
Reminds me of something, but I can't remember what.

930
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:24,970
Oh my goodness.

931
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,090
Can you even see?

932
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,190
Oh, you can see the necklace.

933
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,770
Wow, these are all really hideous.

934
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,750
This is all you get.

935
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:40,910
Imagine you paid for this DLC and this is what they provide you.

936
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:43,030
What the heck is that?

937
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,630
Oh, it's awful.

938
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,930
And then a shark tooth.

939
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,390
That's not even a shark tooth.

940
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:49,070
What is that?

941
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:59,090
Flat 2D texture.

942
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,130
It is.

943
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:05,230
Maybe I should have it because it's just like me.

944
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:05,950
Flat.

945
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,090
We'll go with the fish tooth.

946
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,210
Oh, a ring.

947
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:17,490
They all look the same.

948
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,170
Oh, we got a cool thumb ring.

949
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:26,190
So that my finger shines when I do a thumbs up.

950
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:27,810
What's this?

951
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,270
Oh my gosh, we're blinged out.

952
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:35,070
How many can I have?

953
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:41,350
Oh, there we go.

954
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,570
We're blinged out.

955
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:43,330
We're blinged out.

956
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,380
Nice.

957
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,680
And we did the makeup.

958
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,680
And eyebrow style.

959
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:57,680
Oh, I like these ones.

960
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,900
They're like more natural now.

961
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,280
My eyebrows are anime eyebrows, so...

962
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:12,460
Hmm...

963
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,040
Honestly, these ones might... Oh, you can't see it.

964
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,600
These ones might fit more, but...

965
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,640
What do you mean you forgot to have eyebrows?

966
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,980
They're right here.

967
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,120
Sorry, every time I click out of the game, it stops the music.

968
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,440
Let's just go with this one.

969
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:58,560
I think it works better.

970
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,120
Okidoki, and our clothing.

971
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,280
Oh my gosh, maid outfit.

972
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,620
Wear, wear.

973
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,420
Oh my gosh, what if I had a crop top on?

974
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,260
Scandalous!

975
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,540
Oh my gosh.

976
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,520
Woah.

977
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:19,760
Woah!

978
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,660
That's for night on the town.

979
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,440
Wait, there's no maid outfit.

980
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,520
Wait, maybe under this.

981
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,400
Why wouldn't there be a maid outfit?

982
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,960
Oh, this is close.

983
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,060
That's close.

984
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,740
Oh, this one's cute.

985
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,640
Oh wait, this is pretty close too.

986
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,080
This is pretty close.

987
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,080
Oh my gosh, I look like a...

988
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,000
50's housewife.

989
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,820
I wish I could change the color though.

990
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,860
Dang, she's feeling herself in the clown.

991
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,300
No way, maid outfit.

992
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,380
Konnichiwa.

993
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,500
Konnichiwa.

994
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,440
We're only halfway through.

995
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,620
There's definitely going to be a maid outfit in here.

996
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:46,320
Bye.

997
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,900
Guys, do you see that?

998
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,540
Woah, look at the mirror.

999
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:02,520
Holy moly, this might be actually...

1000
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,980
Why is this one like one of the sexiest outfits?

1001
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,050
Why is it unironically so sexy?

1002
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,410
Oh, I'm Mrs. Claus.

1003
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,170
We don't want that.

1004
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:29,250
We want a maid.

1005
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,710
Oh, but what if I'm a little...

1006
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:37,430
Holy underboob.

1007
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:38,210
What?

1008
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,530
They're allowed to do that.

1009
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:48,650
Underboob.

1010
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:49,730
Wow.

1011
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:53,810
Those coconuts are struggling.

1012
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:59,210
Wait, what is... The butt looks so good.

1013
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:02,530
See, the butt looks whatever in this.

1014
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:06,410
That looks like what I have to wear when I do 3D.

1015
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:12,150
That's like what I have to do when I become 3D.

1016
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,370
There really are no maid outfits.

1017
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:18,150
This is so sad.

1018
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:20,990
Let's go back to this one.

1019
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:29,550
Guys, I don't know if I'm feeling the monkey head anymore.

1020
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,450
It's throwing off my vibe.

1021
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:35,170
Let's go back to hair.

1022
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,950
And my everyday outfit.

1023
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:44,430
Let's go with...

1024
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,010
Wait, oh my gosh.

1025
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:50,550
Wait, does this actually match?

1026
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:51,810
Wait, this one.

1027
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:57,610
It matches.

1028
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,110
Oh my gosh.

1029
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,270
That's...

1030
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,070
The ears are killing me.

1031
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:16,030
Oh here, hold on.

1032
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:17,450
There we go.

1033
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:29,110
They are the

1034
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:33,750
same picture.

1035
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:40,390
So that's our everyday outfit and then this is our form...

1036
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:41,830
Wait, where did this hair come from?

1037
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:43,350
What?

1038
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,010
Who are you?

1039
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:45,610
What?

1040
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:47,730
Our formal outfit.

1041
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,270
Where is the kimono?

1042
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:58,490
Wait, this could be the formal outfit.

1043
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,470
What happened to the hair?

1044
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:08,590
Holy...Wow!

1045
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:11,910
Cheetah.

1046
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:14,950
Cheetah print.

1047
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:15,010
What?

1048
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:16,470
Wow.

1049
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:19,190
Gyaru?

1050
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:20,510
Okay, we can be a gyaru.

1051
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,220
But seriously, what happened to the hair?

1052
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,300
Now it's not letting me...Oh here we go.

1053
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,140
When did I choose this?

1054
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:48,830
With the top hat obviously.

1055
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:51,970
We are so dapper.

1056
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:12,700
Don't look.

1057
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,120
It's not for your eyes.

1058
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,380
Oh my goodness.

1059
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,580
I'm going to give her some granny panties.

1060
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,520
So that you guys...

1061
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:27,260
You guys can't get too excited.

1062
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,820
Oh wait, I can give her actual shorts.

1063
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,500
Oh wait, this is kind of my color.

1064
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,960
Or I can just cover her up entirely.

1065
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,760
This one is so sexy though.

1066
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,420
You guys can't see.

1067
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,380
You guys are missing a good show.

1068
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:02,520
Hello.

1069
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:09,360
It's a mirror.

1070
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,240
Oh no!

1071
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,520
Anyway,

1072
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,700
let's go to sleepwear.

1073
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,140
Gosh.

1074
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:41,360
I usually...I'm not going to lie.

1075
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,720
That looks dirty though.

1076
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,680
Why is it so dirty and gross?

1077
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:49,880
I sometimes wear pajamas like this.

1078
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:55,380
My little...I call them...

1079
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:58,600
I call them my lumberjacks.

1080
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,640
These are usually dirty.

1081
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,900
Not like this.

1082
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,780
This is awful.

1083
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,120
This is so bad.

1084
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:16,460
But I like wearing comfy t-shirts and pants.

1085
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,080
That's what I wear.

1086
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:23,150
People who wear stuff like this, I'm like, how do you do that?

1087
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:24,830
Well, sometimes, you know.

1088
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:26,690
Unless I'm like naked.

1089
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,720
I only like to do that if I'm so hot.

1090
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:41,250
Swimsuit!

1091
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:46,030
Okay, what's our closest to a Tsukumizu?

1092
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:48,890
Maybe this.

1093
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:53,310
Maybe that.

1094
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,900
Or this.

1095
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,580
Actually, this might be the best one.

1096
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,120
I don't really go swimming.

1097
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,880
Neither will my Sim.

1098
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,620
It's music.

1099
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:20,210
This is our athletic outfit.

1100
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,240
How is this?

1101
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,700
Oh, it's like a tennis outfit.

1102
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,440
I see.

1103
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,050
Wait!

1104
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:37,290
Oh my gosh!

1105
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:39,210
You guys!

1106
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,190
Look at that!

1107
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:43,210
It's perfect!

1108
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:46,030
It's absolutely perfect.

1109
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:46,330
Perfect.

1110
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:49,010
Nice.

1111
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:51,210
And then this is our outerwear.

1112
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:54,710
Maybe we can find...

1113
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,910
Oh, this is so cute, actually.

1114
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:59,810
Oh my gosh, it's so stinking cute.

1115
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:03,770
Puffy jacket is kind of cute, too.

1116
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,010
I like this one.

1117
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:14,210
I'm going to eat some more of my salad.

1118
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:14,590
Hold on.

1119
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,670
I don't want to get kind of gross and all.

1120
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:27,380
You like the look?

1121
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,080
OK, we'll go with this.

1122
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:30,600
What

1123
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,080
are my goals?

1124
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,720
What is a pleasure aspiration?

1125
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,920
Love wild nights out.

1126
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,500
Cozy nights in.

1127
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,760
They would want the good life.

1128
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,400
But I...

1129
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,620
Fortune, money baby, money.

1130
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,560
Fortune and glory.

1131
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:12,890
But I think only the romance wants to woohoo.

1132
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:15,570
Three woohoos.

1133
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:21,170
What about knowledge?

1134
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:23,890
Why can't I be a...

1135
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:25,150
Well...

1136
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:29,810
Maybe knowledge.

1137
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:48,930
I don't think ask for homework help should be so big.

1138
01:09:58,510 --> 01:09:59,950
Zodiac stuff so well?

1139
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,450
I don't remember which one I am.

1140
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:05,850
October 1st, which one am I, you guys?

1141
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:09,230
But we shall...

1142
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,670
We shall determine my personality.

1143
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:17,170
So I think I'm a little more neat than sloppy.

1144
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:19,710
But I'm not entirely neat.

1145
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:23,490
Looks in the mirror, plus 3000 aspiration.

1146
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,010
A Libra.

1147
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,740
Max out sloppy.

1148
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:33,560
No!

1149
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:40,410
When it comes to being shy.

1150
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,840
I know it's classic Sims BGM.

1151
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:49,840
I

1152
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,480
think I'm like in between active and lazy.

1153
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,240
Oh wait.

1154
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,320
Wait.

1155
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:08,840
That would be in between.

1156
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:09,700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1157
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,040
That's in between.

1158
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:11,520
There we go.

1159
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,320
I think I'm like in between.

1160
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,560
Sometimes I'm kind of lazy.

1161
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,040
I think I'm also maybe like...

1162
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:26,360
Wow.

1163
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:27,340
Wow.

1164
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,220
Oh no.

1165
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:35,340
I'm not nice at all.

1166
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,240
I'm a cancer.

1167
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:43,470
I'm too grouchy.

1168
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:44,530
I'm very grouchy then.

1169
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:48,410
Maybe I will take off some from me.

1170
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:50,890
I don't know though.

1171
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:53,890
It's kind of weird being like... Oh my gosh guys.

1172
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:55,090
I'm so nice.

1173
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:58,770
Guys, I'm just so nice.

1174
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:00,110
Oh my gosh.

1175
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:04,490
One less playful?

1176
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:05,330
You think so?

1177
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:08,330
What?

1178
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:09,770
Where is Libra?

1179
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,120
This one.

1180
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,200
Oh.

1181
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,420
I don't fit that at all.

1182
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,680
No.

1183
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:27,440
No.

1184
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,480
No.

1185
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:32,940
That's mean.

1186
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,800
In between.

1187
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:43,300
Maybe like that?

1188
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,980
Less neat?

1189
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,160
What are you talking about?

1190
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,840
You don't...You don't come to my maid cafe.

1191
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:09,500
You don't know...You don't know what my room looks like.

1192
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,620
You don't know.

1193
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:20,560
There is cobwebs.

1194
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:21,960
Oh for atmosphere?

1195
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,520
I want to go with a get rich.

1196
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,580
I want to actually maybe create a multi-level marketing.

1197
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,920
And make it big and rich.

1198
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,840
So my turn on is...

1199
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,100
Full face of makeup.

1200
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,320
Vampires?

1201
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,240
That's a good one.

1202
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,640
Underwear.

1203
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:49,360
Dang.

1204
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:50,860
What?

1205
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,560
Like how I can just be like...

1206
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,060
Snake in a tux.

1207
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,540
Little age soldiers.

1208
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,960
Stop it.

1209
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:02,940
Jewelry.

1210
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,200
I was like married?

1211
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,420
That would be pretty messed up.

1212
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:07,920
Charismatic.

1213
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:09,500
Oh my gosh.

1214
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:10,920
I love when they are unemployed.

1215
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,980
I can't believe.

1216
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,420
I can't...Wait.

1217
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,000
Shouldn't underwear just be a given?

1218
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:19,320
No?

1219
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,500
Are there people that have a turn off to underwear?

1220
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:29,340
Who says someone in their underwear and is like...

1221
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,660
Put it back on.

1222
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,920
I never would have seen that.

1223
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:37,760
Nudists.

1224
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,040
Oh they don't want anything.

1225
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:41,940
Sports.

1226
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:42,900
Yuck.

1227
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,020
What is that?

1228
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,940
Plant-simism.

1229
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,800
Here's my investment in Domingo's pyramid scheme.

1230
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:00,680
No, no.

1231
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:02,140
It's a multi-level marketing.

1232
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,580
It's not a pyramid scheme.

1233
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,640
It might be pyramid shaped.

1234
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,780
But actually we call it a triangle of wisdom.

1235
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,420
Okay, so we have robots and we have...

1236
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:15,960
You know what?

1237
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,500
I'm going to say formal wear.

1238
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,120
That is the truth.

1239
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,320
And then, what is this?

1240
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:21,840
Oh, cologne.

1241
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:24,500
My turn off is...

1242
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:29,680
Underwear.

1243
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:31,880
What is this one?

1244
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:32,620
Oh, stink.

1245
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,040
Oh, custom hair.

1246
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,140
What is this one?

1247
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,160
Logical, okay.

1248
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,300
A construction worker?

1249
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,380
I hate when they are creative.

1250
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,560
Wait, why does it feel like there is...

1251
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,320
Oh, because of the two that I just added.

1252
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,460
I can't make them a turn off.

1253
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:57,420
I

1254
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:04,860
don't want a zombie.

1255
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:12,220
Because I'm a ghost and we kind of fight with undead.

1256
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:18,140
I'm dead, but I'm here.

1257
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:21,420
And then zombies are dead, but they are there.

1258
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:23,800
And it just kind of is like...

1259
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,320
We are just always beefing.

1260
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,260
It's just kind of annoying.

1261
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:29,700
Yeah, pretty awkward.

1262
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,420
Yeah, yeah, so...

1263
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,200
That's my turn off.

1264
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:34,960
A zombie.

1265
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,940
Makes sense.

1266
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,880
The Dorito of wisdom.

1267
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,240
Everybody...

1268
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,660
Why does she look like that?

1269
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:49,820
Say hello to Miss Cheesy.

1270
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:54,340
Alright.

1271
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:56,500
I'm going to make Matara now.

1272
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:15,330
Matara is going to be my roommate.

1273
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:18,590
We also can't do...

1274
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:20,990
We'll do...

1275
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:22,570
What's the close...

1276
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:23,750
Maybe this is the close...

1277
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:25,390
Orange is like the closest to pink, no?

1278
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:29,050
Oh yeah, my bad.

1279
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:36,150
Oh my gosh, if I become a grandma I can change my hair.

1280
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,080
I see.

1281
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,960
It doesn't matter if it's orange or not.

1282
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,640
Fine, I'll make her an adult.

1283
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,140
Okay, Matara's hair is...

1284
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:56,380
Hold on, let me get a picture of her.

1285
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,160
Actually, I'm going to make her a witch because that's what she is.

1286
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,240
With a B.

1287
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:02,480
Yeah.

1288
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:09,120
Or, we can do this and we'll never have to see her face.

1289
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:20,760
We could give her...

1290
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,000
Oh my gosh, Matara-Kan.

1291
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:24,740
You're so cute.

1292
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,210
I'm debating.

1293
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:41,970
Oh wait.

1294
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,050
She had her little...

1295
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:46,030
Wait, this is actually so perfect.

1296
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:48,390
She had her commander outfit.

1297
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,130
So, actually we can do this one.

1298
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:52,750
That works.

1299
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:54,350
That actually works.

1300
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:57,670
Yeah, she has a commander hat.

1301
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:00,130
Matara's eye color, what is it, yellow?

1302
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:01,470
Oh, wait a second.

1303
01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:04,210
Is she going to get mad at me for this?

1304
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:13,130
Hold on.

1305
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:14,350
One moment, please.

1306
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:17,150
One moment, please.

1307
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:31,880
Sorry, hold on.

1308
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,440
But...

1309
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,340
Remember when we played PT?

1310
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,000
Okay, okay.

1311
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,960
Red eyes.

1312
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:00,580
How can I do that?

1313
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:09,620
I possessed her for just a moment.

1314
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,940
I possessed her for just a second.

1315
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,540
Don't tell her.

1316
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:18,860
We'll go with...

1317
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:21,820
What should we do since we can't go with...

1318
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:22,780
Maybe brown?

1319
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,900
Worst eye color.

1320
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,420
Say the thing.

1321
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,880
Hi, honeys.

1322
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:40,800
Oh, I'm Matara-Kan.

1323
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:40,960
Dude.

1324
01:20:52,670 --> 01:20:54,290
I feel gross.

1325
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:54,910
I need a shower.

1326
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,010
I'm going to change back.

1327
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,290
I'm going to change back!

1328
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:03,930
Goodbye, Matara.

1329
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:08,550
There we go.

1330
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:09,490
Nice.

1331
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:14,650
Alrighty.

1332
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:20,250
And let's give her some actual bug eyes, you know?

1333
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:22,230
I think that would be good for her, truly.

1334
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:38,100
You can go tell Matara that to her face.

1335
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:39,460
I

1336
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:50,140
don't want to see any of your confessions to Matara-Kan.

1337
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:00,550
Reject him as Matara?

1338
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:01,090
No.

1339
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:02,330
It's okay.

1340
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:08,840
Okay.

1341
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:16,240
So, her eyes are, like, always kind of...

1342
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,300
Oh no, she's actually...

1343
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,490
Her eyes are, like, yeah...

1344
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,100
They're, like, really sharp, you know?

1345
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,100
They're really sharp.

1346
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,900
She does got bug eyes, though.

1347
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:29,040
I mean, they are pretty big.

1348
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:30,460
Is Matara gone already?

1349
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,840
I went and grabbed my ring.

1350
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,140
Yeah, she's gone!

1351
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:38,620
She's gone!

1352
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:40,900
Look, she says, I don't want to talk to you anymore.

1353
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:45,720
My name is Matara-Kan.

1354
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:47,900
You're trying to propose to me?

1355
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:49,680
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

1356
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:51,600
Don't smile.

1357
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:03,860
Nah,

1358
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:10,900
I think, actually, this is kind of perfect.

1359
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,640
What's her nose?

1360
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,780
She's got an even smaller nose.

1361
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:22,500
This looks like she smelled something bad.

1362
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,700
Yes, Matara-Kan.

1363
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:36,080
Yes, Matara-Kan.

1364
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:37,800
Yes.

1365
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:37,860
Yes.

1366
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,900
Oh, maybe I should have switched my lips up.

1367
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:47,620
This actually looks so good.

1368
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:50,720
I actually look so much like her.

1369
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,340
She got them crazy lashes.

1370
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,940
She got a little... Actually, well, she's got, like...

1371
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,000
Okay, perfect!

1372
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:02,080
Oh my gosh!

1373
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:05,180
Snake!

1374
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,540
Remember how I said my turn-off was zombie?

1375
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,080
Wait!

1376
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,840
This is so perfect!

1377
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,300
Oh my gosh!

1378
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,220
This is actually so perfect.

1379
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:28,460
It's her!

1380
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,640
It's literally her.

1381
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:34,580
It's literally her.

1382
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,200
What the hell are these?

1383
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,220
Oh wait, the commander outfit.

1384
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,260
Oh my god, this is also old school music.

1385
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:51,640
I thought you could adjust, like, their boobs and stuff in this game, no?

1386
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:55,700
Everyone has the same body shape?

1387
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,420
How do I still remember?

1388
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:04,220
I don't know.

1389
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:07,020
When she said ba-ba-ba, I felt it in my heart.

1390
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:10,060
I told you, I really liked this game.

1391
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:15,760
Oh my gosh, this is so...

1392
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,900
Wait, you guys are gonna get too excited over this, I think.

1393
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:21,120
It is really her.

1394
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,200
Don't get too excited.

1395
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,640
Remember whose stream you're watching.

1396
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,260
Remember whose stream you're watching!

1397
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:45,180
Why would everything look so sexy on her?

1398
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:59,970
Fine, we'll keep this.

1399
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:04,750
I don't see, like, the military outfit that goes with the hat.

1400
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:07,170
Did you guys see it or did I pass it?

1401
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:17,150
I think you guys...

1402
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:21,670
Yeah.

1403
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:30,800
Sorry, I don't have a big boobie.

1404
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,780
I

1405
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:43,300
don't have a big boobie because I am a boob.

1406
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,940
Simple as.

1407
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:51,380
Oh my gosh.

1408
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,700
I thought that was...

1409
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:55,780
Wait.

1410
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:55,820
Wait.

1411
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:01,660
Oh, there it is!

1412
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,000
The commander outfit.

1413
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,660
It's just literally a sailor though.

1414
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,440
Nah, we'll go with the other one.

1415
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:10,120
I thought it was a Robin Hood outfit, that one.

1416
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:12,500
You have big booty.

1417
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:20,250
Nah, we'll go with this.

1418
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:21,110
The clown.

1419
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:23,610
Wow, her formal outfit.

1420
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:25,290
This one, obvious.

1421
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:27,990
Oh my gosh, it's so much like her normal outfit.

1422
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:30,450
We have to go with this one.

1423
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:39,560
Her undies.

1424
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,080
Doesn't she canonically have underwear?

1425
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:50,830
We'll go with the black.

1426
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:52,510
Actually, no, this one is sexier.

1427
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,390
She's gonna be so sexy.

1428
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:57,090
Everybody is gonna be like...

1429
01:28:57,090 --> 01:28:58,010
Oh, Matara-con.

1430
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:00,170
Matara-cheesy.

1431
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:04,210
Matara-cheesy-con.

1432
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:08,190
I've come to propose to you.

1433
01:29:09,370 --> 01:29:11,190
Nobody's gonna go ask out.

1434
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:13,070
Sad Minto.

1435
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,120
Oh my gosh, sexy.

1436
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:19,540
We'll go with the pink.

1437
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:22,980
Oh my gosh.

1438
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:24,980
Wait, this is so cute.

1439
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,280
Oh my gosh, this is so cute.

1440
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:30,780
Wait.

1441
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:33,200
This one is my favorite.

1442
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:34,500
It's so cute.

1443
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:39,040
Nah, I like it in purple better.

1444
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:46,830
I already rejected Matara.

1445
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:48,550
What do you mean you rejected her?

1446
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:52,090
What do you mean?

1447
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:53,690
What if we did...

1448
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:54,350
Oh my gosh, wait.

1449
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:57,330
What if with Matara we had the 100 baby challenge?

1450
01:29:58,270 --> 01:29:59,550
Do you think we could?

1451
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:05,530
We gotta give her the Baywatch outfit or whatever she wants.

1452
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:09,410
The wise man once said, flat is justice and medium is premium.

1453
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:14,650
This one.

1454
01:30:14,930 --> 01:30:15,950
This is what she wants.

1455
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:16,850
This is what she wants.

1456
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:21,630
And then, for her athletic wear.

1457
01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:25,130
It's so cute.

1458
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:29,070
Huh?

1459
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:32,050
You guys don't know the Sims 100 baby challenge?

1460
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,320
100 husband challenge.

1461
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:39,360
I wonder how many husbands she could kill.

1462
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:44,000
Oh, I forgot to change her hair.

1463
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,100
For like all her other outfits.

1464
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:49,620
This, oh wait.

1465
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,820
We'll go with just down.

1466
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:01,610
100 killed husbands, yeah.

1467
01:31:04,190 --> 01:31:05,630
I've seen that fan art.

1468
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:08,310
Fan art what?

1469
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,380
Oh wait, no, this is not night time, sorry.

1470
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:28,460
At night, she takes off her wig.

1471
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,220
Wait, what did I just do?

1472
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:36,940
At night, she takes off her wig.

1473
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,400
Yeah, this is fine.

1474
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,820
Actually, this all works, honestly.

1475
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:44,900
And

1476
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,330
then for her outdoors.

1477
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:56,660
You guys, you thought that orange was natural?

1478
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:57,840
Heck no.

1479
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,600
Miss cheesy, everything's pink.

1480
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:06,600
Everything, she is so easy because there's so much pink.

1481
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,560
There's so much pink everything.

1482
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,580
Easy peasy.

1483
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:13,960
All right, Matara's personality.

1484
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:17,760
So we're going to give her the romance aspiration because she's always wanting husbands.

1485
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:21,680
And she's kind of...

1486
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:24,480
She's extremely outgoing.

1487
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:26,480
She's active.

1488
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,820
She's playful.

1489
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,600
I wonder if she's actually a Leo.

1490
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,980
Does this seem accurate to you guys?

1491
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:44,380
If you know Matara.

1492
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,300
Is Mata nice?

1493
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:56,820
Yeah, she's a cockroach, so she's got to be max sloppy.

1494
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,200
And she's like crazy outgoing.

1495
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:02,240
And she's pretty active.

1496
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:06,700
And she's really playful, but she can be serious.

1497
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,570
All right, what are Matara...

1498
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:22,350
Okay, knowing Matara...

1499
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:29,010
I don't know if I've ever...

1500
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:32,350
I don't know if we've ever had this con...

1501
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:34,710
I'm sure she's mentioned it to me before.

1502
01:33:36,170 --> 01:33:38,370
Probably, just like what her type is.

1503
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:41,810
Is this what... hats?

1504
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:42,710
Oh my god.

1505
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:45,230
What if it turned on his hat?

1506
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:45,370
Hats.

1507
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:50,150
Oh yeah, that hat really gets me going.

1508
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:52,310
Oh yeah, keep it on.

1509
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:53,370
Keep it on.

1510
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,020
Do you have two players?

1511
01:34:17,870 --> 01:34:19,890
Matara probably likes fitness.

1512
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:23,210
She does work out, unemployed and hat.

1513
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:31,490
Oh yeah, maybe she's pretty like...

1514
01:34:31,490 --> 01:34:32,870
You know, maybe underwear...

1515
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:34,930
Oh, cologne.

1516
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:36,230
Oh, this one's the smell.

1517
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:40,850
Wait, what if her turn on is stink?

1518
01:34:41,450 --> 01:34:43,990
What if she likes a little bit of smelliness?

1519
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:45,710
Oh, because she's a cockroach.

1520
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:50,330
She's a cockroach, so of course she's going to be like attracted to the garbage.

1521
01:34:52,190 --> 01:34:54,210
That just makes sense.

1522
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:55,130
Okay.

1523
01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:59,530
And then her turn off would be...

1524
01:35:04,470 --> 01:35:06,150
Good at cleaning.

1525
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:11,870
Because she's a cockroach.

1526
01:35:12,390 --> 01:35:16,110
And you get cockroaches if you are too good at cleaning.

1527
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:16,310
Stink.

1528
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:25,150
Pretty sure she said she likes guy smell.

1529
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:28,850
I

1530
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:46,610
don't want to think about it.

1531
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:51,100
She did?

1532
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:52,620
Oh my god.

1533
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,520
Maybe she likes cologne?

1534
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,160
Or is it like...

1535
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,300
Guy, guy smell.

1536
01:35:58,600 --> 01:35:59,220
Like the meme.

1537
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,540
Like, guy smell.

1538
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,820
Guy smell.

1539
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:03,760
Mata is Eva.

1540
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:11,440
Boy smell.

1541
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:12,600
Wow, boy smell.

1542
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:20,110
I'm judging a little.

1543
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:22,290
Well, only because it's Matara I'm judging.

1544
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:31,220
Why are they staring at each other?

1545
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:37,470
It's the mask?

1546
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:45,120
Oh my god, her eyes just rolled into the back of her head.

1547
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:52,920
Okay, so our relationship.

1548
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:54,960
This is my cat.

1549
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,340
Wait, how do I make my cat?

1550
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:58,000
Okay, nevermind.

1551
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,780
So we're roomies!

1552
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:03,620
We're roomies!

1553
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:05,900
Okay guys.

1554
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:10,660
I'm gonna strike it rich and make it big.

1555
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:16,500
And then Matara is going to woohoo for 100 babies.

1556
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:18,740
They were roommates.

1557
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,060
Wow, they were roommates.

1558
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:27,160
Now, we're not quite done.

1559
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:32,200
Because we have to also make our rival family.

1560
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,860
Which will include Snake.

1561
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,960
This is the solid family.

1562
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:45,440
We're making Snake.

1563
01:37:57,860 --> 01:37:58,960
Snake and Otacon!

1564
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:01,980
Wait, what if I scramble?

1565
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,420
What if we just happen to get the perfect Snake?

1566
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:06,880
Hold on, I'm going to close my eyes.

1567
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:08,640
I

1568
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:16,210
want to beef with this family.

1569
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:20,730
You know, I kind of want to have a family where we're always at each other's throats.

1570
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:22,330
And it's just like, no!

1571
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:25,230
I will never let you come upon my land!

1572
01:38:25,790 --> 01:38:28,970
I will literally shoot you dead!

1573
01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:30,550
Real America moment.

1574
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:37,830
You better be about to make the same guy four times and then Osolat.

1575
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:41,370
Let's see.

1576
01:38:41,470 --> 01:38:44,770
Okay, I give up.

1577
01:38:44,850 --> 01:38:45,370
These all suck.

1578
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:47,770
Oh my gosh!

1579
01:38:51,310 --> 01:38:53,630
This is a good starting point.

1580
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:56,750
Alright.

1581
01:38:57,570 --> 01:38:59,030
Solid Snake.

1582
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:01,050
Oh my gosh!

1583
01:39:01,090 --> 01:39:02,430
He already has the headband!

1584
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,640
Wait, this is also a headband.

1585
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:34,430
Can one house be Otacon and Naomi?

1586
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:37,370
Oh wait!

1587
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:40,770
What if we do make Naomi and have our place be spewed with her?

1588
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,030
Aki, happy birthday!

1589
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:46,650
Thank you for always being a huge source of happiness for me.

1590
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:48,670
Thank you so much!

1591
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:52,230
Happy birthday to you!

1592
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:54,850
Happy birthday to you!

1593
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:58,070
Happy birthday dear Aki!

1594
01:39:59,450 --> 01:40:02,890
Happy birthday to you!

1595
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:05,250
Happy birthday!

1596
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:14,840
Wait.

1597
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:15,480
Oh my gosh.

1598
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:15,720
Wait.

1599
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:16,240
Plissken.

1600
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:19,060
Okay.

1601
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:19,380
Wait.

1602
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:20,080
I can't do this.

1603
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:21,200
I can't...

1604
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:22,140
I can't do this.

1605
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:22,760
I can't do this.

1606
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:23,640
I can't do this.

1607
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:24,500
I can't do this.

1608
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,360
I can't do this.

1609
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,220
I can't do this.

1610
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:27,140
It's too...

1611
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:41,300
He looks too good.

1612
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:42,960
Let's make our house.

1613
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:44,720
Okay, hold on.

1614
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:46,040
How much money do we have, Matara?

1615
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,700
How much money do we have?

1616
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:50,060
Matara.

1617
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:53,260
Oh, we have 25,000 simoleons.

1618
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,120
We're gonna move here.

1619
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,160
And I'm gonna build us a house, baby.

1620
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:11,400
Guys...

1621
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,540
How do I use cheats?

1622
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:18,360
Why are we in the middle of the ocean?

1623
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:20,020
Oh my god!

1624
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:21,360
My cat is so cute!

1625
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,060
Oh my god!

1626
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:24,560
My cat is so cute!

1627
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,780
Oh my... Give love.

1628
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:27,960
Give love.

1629
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:28,760
Feed treat.

1630
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,360
Feed treat to Chucky Cheesy.

1631
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:38,640
No cheating good, because we're having to build a house.

1632
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:42,800
Oh, Matara's bird watching.

1633
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:48,820
Okay.

1634
01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:50,000
How do I bring it?

1635
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:51,260
Oh, CTRL-SHIFT-C.

1636
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:51,960
Thank you!

1637
01:42:16,490 --> 01:42:18,310
Alright, this is just to build our house.

1638
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:24,560
This is just to build our house, everybody.

1639
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,700
We gotta even out the land.

1640
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:31,300
Wait, did that even it?

1641
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:32,020
Wait.

1642
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,380
Oh no, that pushed it.

1643
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:34,400
Undo.

1644
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:35,540
Up.

1645
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:36,340
Bring it up.

1646
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:37,860
No!

1647
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:39,400
Why is it so high?

1648
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:40,320
There we go.

1649
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:40,760
Nice.

1650
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,400
Oh my gosh, it's so bumpy!

1651
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:45,560
It's so bumpy!

1652
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:50,380
How do I... How do I... How can I tell?

1653
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:53,120
Oh, it's so bumpy.

1654
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:57,600
Okay, they're just gonna have to have a little bit of an unconventional space.

1655
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:14,880
Now, we're gonna give a bit of a yard.

1656
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:22,040
Let's give it a little bit of, you know, let's give it a little bit of character.

1657
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,020
What if I have it in the shape of something?

1658
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:31,390
Oh wait, I'm gonna make it... Oh, because it's Mint and Vitara...

1659
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:35,270
I'm gonna make it in the shape of an M!

1660
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:48,830
Wait.

1661
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:51,510
Oh, diagonal, diagonal, diagonal is kind of crazy.

1662
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:01,680
Location out of bounds?

1663
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:03,400
What are you talking about?

1664
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:04,420
How is that out of bounds?

1665
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:16,260
Build the foundation first.

1666
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:17,580
What do you mean?

1667
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:18,500
Do I have to do that?

1668
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:22,280
Build the foundation?

1669
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:37,320
I

1670
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:42,600
don't think you needed foundation.

1671
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:47,700
Maybe it'll help.

1672
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:50,760
I don't know why this is technically... Why is this out of bounds?

1673
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,680
You just have to be two tiles away.

1674
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:09,000
Oops, I forgot a piece here.

1675
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:12,800
It's a flavor wall.

1676
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:15,680
Okay, hold on.

1677
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:18,000
So we're gonna have to... I'm gonna keep it just because...

1678
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:20,280
It'll help me keep track.

1679
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:21,040
Alright.

1680
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:26,580
Need something to support it.

1681
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:28,160
Alright, there we go.

1682
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:30,560
M.

1683
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:34,620
Oh my god, so close.

1684
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:36,000
Alright, one more.

1685
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:36,600
There we go.

1686
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:37,580
Nice.

1687
01:45:51,650 --> 01:45:53,550
This is the entrance.

1688
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:54,510
Doorway.

1689
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:56,170
Right here.

1690
01:45:57,190 --> 01:45:58,830
So one half will be hers.

1691
01:46:00,010 --> 01:46:01,810
And one half will be mine.

1692
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:03,710
You get it?

1693
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:07,610
Oh yeah!

1694
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:09,870
You might be wondering...

1695
01:46:10,930 --> 01:46:12,970
Well Minto, what goes on outside here?

1696
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:16,610
We can build something else.

1697
01:46:17,410 --> 01:46:17,810
A

1698
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:27,580
patio?

1699
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:29,540
Oh yeah.

1700
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:30,440
What's this?

1701
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,400
Half wall?

1702
01:46:38,370 --> 01:46:39,750
What's the difference between these?

1703
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:51,580
What are these for?

1704
01:46:57,610 --> 01:46:58,870
Timeout rooms?

1705
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:01,190
Yeah, these are the pods.

1706
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:08,040
Actually, I'm gonna make like...

1707
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:13,900
Why can't I make it any bigger?

1708
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:18,960
We're gonna make two.

1709
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:20,460
One for me, one for her.

1710
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,280
His and her pod room.

1711
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:23,540
Idea.

1712
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:28,150
Microwave hallway?

1713
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:31,770
Like love is blind?

1714
01:47:32,890 --> 01:47:34,850
Oh my gosh, kind of.

1715
01:47:34,850 --> 01:47:40,690
But then... So this is the only way that we'll be able to get to each other's parts of the house.

1716
01:47:45,110 --> 01:47:46,850
Because it's gonna be connected.

1717
01:47:54,610 --> 01:47:57,170
And it's gonna be like that.

1718
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:06,500
Bulldoze.

1719
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:07,000
Sledgehammer?

1720
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:11,080
There we go.

1721
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:11,900
Ooh!

1722
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,800
Oh, Artemis!

1723
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:22,000
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

1724
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:23,280
Thank you, thank you!

1725
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:31,480
Oh yeah, we'll need two entrances, but that's just how it is, you know?

1726
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:34,640
There we go.

1727
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:35,140
Perfect.

1728
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:41,190
Why can't... What do you mean I can't build diagonally?

1729
01:48:41,950 --> 01:48:44,350
That is literally what I've been doing this entire time.

1730
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:48,970
What are you talking about?

1731
01:48:49,210 --> 01:48:50,630
I can't build diagonally.

1732
01:48:56,810 --> 01:48:58,130
I'll just do it like that.

1733
01:48:59,110 --> 01:49:02,970
Okay, so this is the only way that they can have access to each other.

1734
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:09,810
Oh wait, it's kind of off-center, but that's okay.

1735
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:16,110
See, we'll have one door here.

1736
01:49:19,470 --> 01:49:20,310
Oh no!

1737
01:49:21,290 --> 01:49:22,770
You know my hole is in the ground.

1738
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:26,250
Undo.

1739
01:49:26,490 --> 01:49:27,470
Wait, it's control?

1740
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:27,970
Yes.

1741
01:49:28,410 --> 01:49:29,190
Okay, I remember.

1742
01:49:29,370 --> 01:49:31,110
Oh my gosh, I remembered, I remembered.

1743
01:49:32,630 --> 01:49:33,890
It's a little off-center.

1744
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:35,990
I'm gonna give myself more room than her.

1745
01:49:38,210 --> 01:49:39,790
And so she gets a door.

1746
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:46,550
And I get a door.

1747
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:48,710
Just like that.

1748
01:49:50,290 --> 01:49:51,250
So nice!

1749
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:54,790
Oh my gosh, the Mintamatora household.

1750
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:05,450
We'll have this area at last.

1751
01:50:06,230 --> 01:50:07,790
There's some windows in here.

1752
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:14,460
Do you think it'd be weird if she could see into my side of the house?

1753
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:21,550
Looks like a folded shirt.

1754
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:24,870
I don't see it.

1755
01:50:31,530 --> 01:50:35,450
I wish there was a one-way mirror so that I could look into hers.

1756
01:50:35,730 --> 01:50:37,670
Actually, I don't want to see what she's doing in there.

1757
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:43,530
I actually would much prefer to have no knowledge of what she's doing at all.

1758
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:44,310
What is this?

1759
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:46,990
Whoa, what is this?

1760
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:53,600
What is this?

1761
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:54,860
Great gate door.

1762
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:56,880
Why does it say H&M on it?

1763
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:58,400
What is this product placement?

1764
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:01,360
Build a balcony over Matara's side?

1765
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:03,140
That's a great idea!

1766
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:04,400
Oh my gosh!

1767
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,340
That's such a good idea.

1768
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:08,160
My

1769
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:14,230
gosh!

1770
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:15,710
That's such a good idea.

1771
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:22,150
Okay, okay.

1772
01:51:22,530 --> 01:51:23,530
How do I do this though?

1773
01:51:24,230 --> 01:51:25,530
Let's put some... Wait, hold on.

1774
01:51:25,590 --> 01:51:27,790
Let's put some flooring down first.

1775
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:29,330
Alright.

1776
01:51:30,670 --> 01:51:33,870
Matara has dreams of Hollywood, so...

1777
01:51:33,870 --> 01:51:35,690
We'll put like that.

1778
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:39,010
We'll put a little... Oh, these are all tiles.

1779
01:51:39,290 --> 01:51:39,830
Okay, there's more.

1780
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:40,530
Okay, cool.

1781
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:42,710
Oh, basketball court!

1782
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:43,630
That one's for me!

1783
01:51:45,650 --> 01:51:47,950
Wait, how do I make it so that it doesn't go outside?

1784
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:54,860
Okay, we're playing b-ball in my room.

1785
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:59,180
Because it's like...

1786
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:01,020
You know.

1787
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:02,880
What is this anyway?

1788
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:03,720
Dinosaurs?

1789
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:08,120
If it was dinosaurs, I was about to change it to me.

1790
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:14,160
Okay, is this grass?

1791
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:15,220
Oh, it's carpet.

1792
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:16,840
I wonder if they have dinosaurs.

1793
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:25,340
I have to have you guys... Oh my gosh.

1794
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:27,920
Okay, so one of the funniest things is happening.

1795
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:29,280
Right now.

1796
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:30,580
On TikTok.

1797
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:36,540
The dinosaur community is like all up in arms.

1798
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:40,920
Because they're so mad that the Spinosaurus keeps getting debuffed.

1799
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:44,120
Have you guys seen what the Spinosaurus looks like anymore?

1800
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:45,740
It's so sad.

1801
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:47,860
He's got like this...

1802
01:52:47,860 --> 01:52:51,180
He's got like this floppy nose now.

1803
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:54,800
And everyone's so mad because he looks so ugly.

1804
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:59,580
But they keep buffing the T-Rex.

1805
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:01,800
And basically at this point they're like...

1806
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:03,800
Yeah, the T-Rex has like...

1807
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:06,700
He's got...

1808
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:11,780
He's got lasers shooting out of his eyes.

1809
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:13,800
And he's crazy.

1810
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,580
Wait, how do I do it so it's only within the walls?

1811
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:26,120
Everyone's up in arms about it.

1812
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:29,240
The poor Spinosaurus.

1813
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:32,180
The Spinosaurus Discord is in shambles.

1814
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:33,660
Oh, shift click.

1815
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:34,240
Thank you!

1816
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:35,700
Oh!

1817
01:53:36,660 --> 01:53:38,300
I don't want it like that.

1818
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:40,640
Or maybe.

1819
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:42,520
Wait, is this like an optical illusion?

1820
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:48,440
Sticky stacker floors.

1821
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,680
What should be the...

1822
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:58,140
Oh, it should be like a road because it's like a...

1823
01:53:58,140 --> 01:53:58,620
You know.

1824
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,040
Wait, I wish I could make it...

1825
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:05,160
Wait, can I change which direction it's in?

1826
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:10,170
We'll make it like this then.

1827
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:30,250
It's like a little through, you know?

1828
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:33,430
T-Rex chasers keep winning.

1829
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:33,910
No!

1830
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:41,030
The idea of new research being presented as video game patch notes is amazing and more people should do it.

1831
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:43,050
It's so funny because people...

1832
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:44,650
You have the people that are like...

1833
01:54:44,650 --> 01:54:46,350
They keep nerfing my guy!

1834
01:54:46,690 --> 01:54:48,810
What are they doing to the Spinosaurus?

1835
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:50,850
And then you have other people who are just like...

1836
01:54:50,850 --> 01:54:52,590
Guys, this is like science.

1837
01:54:52,850 --> 01:54:53,850
You can't just...

1838
01:54:53,850 --> 01:54:56,750
You can't debuff a creature if that's how he's...

1839
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:58,290
If that's how he looks.

1840
01:54:58,310 --> 01:54:59,510
That's just how he looks.

1841
01:54:59,550 --> 01:55:00,290
And they're like...

1842
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:00,530
No!

1843
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:00,570
No!

1844
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:03,070
They debuffed him!

1845
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:10,100
So it's pretty funny...

1846
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:12,740
How people have been so upset about it.

1847
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:17,480
T-Rex, new with bionic arms, laser eyes.

1848
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:17,820
Yes!

1849
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:20,000
Fire breath.

1850
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:20,460
Yes!

1851
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:23,200
That's like what they keep doing to him.

1852
01:55:35,730 --> 01:55:36,310
Alright.

1853
01:55:36,530 --> 01:55:38,030
Well, maybe I gave them too much money.

1854
01:55:38,030 --> 01:55:41,030
Okay, they might have to like play the lotto or something and...

1855
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:42,550
Lose it all, you know?

1856
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:43,610
What is this?

1857
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:48,580
Ew, it looks so gross!

1858
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:51,740
Cement.

1859
01:55:55,580 --> 01:55:56,300
What's this?

1860
01:56:02,780 --> 01:56:04,580
How do you get that to work?

1861
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:05,080
lol

1862
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:13,000
Modern and sophisticated, I like it.

1863
01:56:16,250 --> 01:56:18,230
Jetpack not available on all platforms.

1864
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:24,270
We still don't know what to put in here yet though.

1865
01:56:24,770 --> 01:56:25,650
We'll figure it out.

1866
01:56:26,430 --> 01:56:26,650
Okay.

1867
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:29,170
Oh, upstairs.

1868
01:56:34,030 --> 01:56:37,410
It's nice and pink because we're going to overlook Matara Khan.

1869
01:56:37,410 --> 01:56:38,410
Pass.

1870
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:46,490
No, it's boots and cats!

1871
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:51,290
It's cool you are following up last year's podcast with your own reality show.

1872
01:56:51,670 --> 01:56:52,190
I know!

1873
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:56,270
What kind of hijinks will they get into?

1874
01:56:58,990 --> 01:57:00,350
And a little border.

1875
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:11,550
Wait.

1876
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:16,790
Actually...

1877
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:22,400
It's like circles, squares, circles.

1878
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:24,480
Many circles.

1879
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:27,100
It's good.

1880
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:35,200
Wait, what did I just do?

1881
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:37,080
Is this not supposed to be a square?

1882
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:40,260
Oh, diagonal.

1883
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:41,320
Oops.

1884
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:44,140
Oh my gosh, I just Ctrl-Zed and it worked.

1885
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:45,940
Room.

1886
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:50,380
Okay, we're just going to have to put this.

1887
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:58,440
Oh wait, but we don't need it here.

1888
01:57:59,240 --> 01:57:59,680
Yeah.

1889
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:01,320
Nice and open.

1890
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:01,840
Wait.

1891
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:03,260
This has a rooftop.

1892
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:05,320
Oh, half wall, half wall.

1893
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:11,740
Wait, no?

1894
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:13,440
How do I make the half wall?

1895
01:58:17,770 --> 01:58:19,150
You can put out railing.

1896
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:19,570
I can?

1897
01:58:21,230 --> 01:58:21,910
How so?

1898
01:58:21,970 --> 01:58:22,450
Like this?

1899
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:46,400
And our rooftop.

1900
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:49,540
Hey, where is the roof here?

1901
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:53,080
Why does this actually look so good?

1902
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:57,340
Wait, why does this actually work so well?

1903
01:58:59,000 --> 01:58:59,400
Wait.

1904
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:03,500
I want this not to have a roof though.

1905
01:59:03,860 --> 01:59:04,540
Like in the middle.

1906
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:13,180
It doesn't look like an M anymore.

1907
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:20,020
A balcony, I think I need to have the wall here for it to have a roof.

1908
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:23,240
Remove roof.

1909
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:27,280
Okay, what I'm just going to do is I'm just going to make it walls.

1910
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,700
It'll make it kind of creepier, but that's okay.

1911
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:35,480
Oh, wait, I did it!

1912
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:37,100
Oh, wait.

1913
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:40,120
Oh wait, how will I look into Matara's room?

1914
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:47,520
Wait, how do I look into Matara's room?

1915
02:00:05,710 --> 02:00:07,270
Make the wall taller.

1916
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:12,270
Build a second floor and just leave it open to below.

1917
02:00:13,470 --> 02:00:14,650
Is that not what I did?

1918
02:00:19,550 --> 02:00:21,170
Make a glass floor.

1919
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:22,710
Can I?

1920
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:26,570
Looking for glass.

1921
02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:29,210
Looking for glass.

1922
02:00:32,270 --> 02:00:33,870
We're looking for glass.

1923
02:00:38,470 --> 02:00:40,910
So I have to build the Matara side to be taller.

1924
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:41,950
I see, I see, I see.

1925
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:42,530
Okay, okay.

1926
02:00:43,830 --> 02:00:46,650
I think that would probably be the easiest way to do it.

1927
02:00:47,550 --> 02:00:48,830
I think you guys are smart.

1928
02:01:05,530 --> 02:01:08,370
Wait, so she's going to get more head space than me?

1929
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:16,660
There we go.

1930
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:19,940
That's kind of messed up.

1931
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:27,800
That's kind of messed up.

1932
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:37,630
It didn't work.

1933
02:01:41,570 --> 02:01:42,130
Um...

1934
02:01:45,970 --> 02:01:47,050
Wait, what just happened?

1935
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:48,110
Undo.

1936
02:01:48,250 --> 02:01:48,730
There we go.

1937
02:01:54,390 --> 02:01:55,550
Delete the roof.

1938
02:02:00,230 --> 02:02:02,130
Oh, I can make my own roof.

1939
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:03,550
I

1940
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:18,100
don't know why it's...

1941
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:21,180
Why it doesn't work.

1942
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:32,780
I haven't saved.

1943
02:02:32,860 --> 02:02:33,220
Thank you.

1944
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:33,400
There we go.

1945
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:38,000
Let's save.

1946
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:41,280
Go up one more floor.

1947
02:02:45,770 --> 02:02:47,170
Auto roof!

1948
02:02:47,310 --> 02:02:47,750
Now!

1949
02:02:48,750 --> 02:02:51,750
What did I do wrong?

1950
02:02:56,730 --> 02:02:58,290
What did I do wrong?

1951
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:03,680
The gap in the...

1952
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:07,160
Oh, maybe if I'm like...

1953
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:09,000
If I do...

1954
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:10,560
Like this?

1955
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:11,560
Like

1956
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:19,100
that?

1957
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:38,830
What a shape.

1958
02:03:43,390 --> 02:03:45,710
It looks

1959
02:03:49,670 --> 02:03:50,570
nice, no?

1960
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:53,700
And then, one thing I'm going to try and do...

1961
02:03:57,490 --> 02:03:59,660
Okay, one thing I want to try and do...

1962
02:04:00,890 --> 02:04:02,580
Is make this out doors.

1963
02:04:04,430 --> 02:04:06,630
Let's see, maybe we just do this.

1964
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:08,190
Maybe I just remove the foundation.

1965
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:17,080
Wait, remove.

1966
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:17,940
There we go.

1967
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:22,340
Back to dirt.

1968
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:26,380
Modern art.

1969
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:27,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1970
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:31,860
I have objections to this house?

1971
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:33,280
No, where?

1972
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:36,800
Where's the bathroom?

1973
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:39,320
We haven't put any furniture in yet.

1974
02:04:40,740 --> 02:04:41,780
Not yet.

1975
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:51,500
Okay, I can't get it quite perfect.

1976
02:04:51,940 --> 02:04:53,380
It's like so dark in there, no?

1977
02:04:53,480 --> 02:04:55,700
I don't want the roof so that there's nothing...

1978
02:04:55,700 --> 02:04:56,360
You know what I mean?

1979
02:05:05,870 --> 02:05:07,730
I'm struggling a little bit here.

1980
02:05:26,750 --> 02:05:28,330
I guess we could do that.

1981
02:05:30,470 --> 02:05:31,370
Where's the pool?

1982
02:05:32,450 --> 02:05:33,070
Oh, here it is.

1983
02:05:35,690 --> 02:05:36,730
Curved edge.

1984
02:05:37,970 --> 02:05:38,850
Swimming pool.

1985
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:39,930
What's this?

1986
02:05:40,050 --> 02:05:41,070
What's the difference?

1987
02:05:43,290 --> 02:05:44,130
I can't...

1988
02:05:44,770 --> 02:05:46,330
Oh, wait.

1989
02:05:46,630 --> 02:05:48,250
Oh, we'll need the foundation back.

1990
02:05:48,730 --> 02:05:49,450
I suppose.

1991
02:05:51,990 --> 02:05:53,570
Oh, it's only allowed on terrain.

1992
02:05:53,570 --> 02:05:54,690
Okay, undo, undo, undo.

1993
02:05:55,330 --> 02:05:55,590
Wait.

1994
02:05:57,930 --> 02:05:58,930
Redo, redo, redo.

1995
02:05:59,310 --> 02:06:00,010
Wait, what's going on?

1996
02:06:00,610 --> 02:06:01,510
Wait, what did I just do?

1997
02:06:02,610 --> 02:06:03,490
How did that happen?

1998
02:06:05,350 --> 02:06:05,710
Wait.

1999
02:06:06,890 --> 02:06:07,930
How did that happen?

2000
02:06:09,050 --> 02:06:10,330
Guys, I think I messed up.

2001
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:27,260
Okay.

2002
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:31,200
I also just realized we're on the second store...

2003
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:31,880
Wait, no.

2004
02:06:32,080 --> 02:06:32,660
This is fine.

2005
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:33,460
It's the foundation.

2006
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:33,620
Foundation.

2007
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:40,740
I should have never put foundation.

2008
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:44,200
It's ruining my plans.

2009
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:57,200
Oh, wait.

2010
02:06:57,260 --> 02:06:58,080
We need to put a door.

2011
02:07:03,540 --> 02:07:05,500
This music is making me crazy.

2012
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:08,320
Oh, no.

2013
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:09,800
Oh, we can have a tree.

2014
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:11,960
No, we can't.

2015
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,340
Must be placed outside.

2016
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:18,720
It is outside.

2017
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:21,720
What are they talking about?

2018
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:31,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2019
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:36,560
What do you mean I can't extend the pool?

2020
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:37,660
What am I doing?

2021
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:38,320
Okay, we're done.

2022
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:40,240
What do you mean?

2023
02:07:46,070 --> 02:07:46,590
Okay.

2024
02:07:47,010 --> 02:07:48,010
One at a time.

2025
02:07:49,810 --> 02:07:50,910
One at a time.

2026
02:07:51,910 --> 02:07:52,730
We're getting it.

2027
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:57,400
Okay, okay.

2028
02:07:58,600 --> 02:07:59,580
Okay, okay, okay.

2029
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:00,560
Okay.

2030
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:03,790
Okay, okay.

2031
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:07,500
Cool.

2032
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:14,710
I might need a...

2033
02:08:16,380 --> 02:08:18,480
like a staircase into it.

2034
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:20,300
So let's get rid of some of this foundation.

2035
02:08:20,820 --> 02:08:21,160
Again.

2036
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:23,280
Foundation sucks.

2037
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:24,400
I'm never putting it ever.

2038
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:26,320
Ever, ever again.

2039
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:35,500
There we go.

2040
02:08:51,910 --> 02:08:53,390
Just like that.

2041
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:11,220
Is it getting confused by the second floor?

2042
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:12,080
I don't know.

2043
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,560
I'm like, there shouldn't be...

2044
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:20,860
a roof right here, which is annoying me a little bit.

2045
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:25,120
I get why it's doing it, but I don't know how to remove it.

2046
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:27,900
Let's see, maybe I can remove it with my own hands.

2047
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:55,490
It's happening!

2048
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:00,920
It's happening!

2049
02:10:04,940 --> 02:10:06,580
We're doing it, we're doing it.

2050
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:12,180
Okay, now I have to add some roof.

2051
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:14,020
Let's add like this.

2052
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:16,560
Oh wow.

2053
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:19,140
Oh my god!

2054
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:21,980
Oh wait, I removed so much roof.

2055
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:23,180
Okay, hold on.

2056
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:23,540
Undo.

2057
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:26,260
I don't think that can fit.

2058
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:28,300
That's so sad.

2059
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:33,140
This one looks like a nose.

2060
02:10:46,570 --> 02:10:46,860
Gosh.

2061
02:10:47,910 --> 02:10:49,840
Being an architect is so hard.

2062
02:10:51,970 --> 02:10:53,370
Make a flat one.

2063
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:54,410
Oh, can I?

2064
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:01,260
Like this?

2065
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:06,540
Wait, what do you mean it can't intersect with other objects?

2066
02:11:06,860 --> 02:11:08,400
Is the round one too much in the way?

2067
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:12,240
It can't intersect.

2068
02:11:16,110 --> 02:11:17,690
That's why they get paid well.

2069
02:11:18,610 --> 02:11:20,390
I think I'm in the wrong business.

2070
02:11:22,910 --> 02:11:26,370
I'm in the wrong stinking business here.

2071
02:11:28,650 --> 02:11:30,590
What is it intersecting with?

2072
02:11:31,370 --> 02:11:33,890
Why doesn't it just merge with the other roof?

2073
02:11:41,620 --> 02:11:42,580
Okay, hold on.

2074
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,180
Like here.

2075
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:44,040
See?

2076
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:46,400
The stairs?

2077
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:48,920
It's

2078
02:11:56,530 --> 02:11:57,050
my birthday.

2079
02:11:57,250 --> 02:11:59,430
I wish Miki the best and please...

2080
02:11:59,430 --> 02:12:00,190
Please what?

2081
02:12:00,670 --> 02:12:01,630
Haunt me!

2082
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:05,430
Thank you for the Akasuba!

2083
02:12:05,730 --> 02:12:06,410
Thank you!

2084
02:12:07,870 --> 02:12:11,210
Happy birthday to you!

2085
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:14,090
Happy birthday to you!

2086
02:12:14,470 --> 02:12:17,650
Happy birthday dear Ian!

2087
02:12:18,850 --> 02:12:22,130
Happy birthday to you!

2088
02:12:25,230 --> 02:12:26,370
Happy birthday!

2089
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:30,540
Okay, I give up.

2090
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:33,600
Architecture?

2091
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:36,920
What have I been doing this entire time if not that?

2092
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:38,800
Wait, is this a stage?

2093
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:40,820
Oh, what is it?

2094
02:12:46,780 --> 02:12:48,360
Oh my gosh!

2095
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:50,460
What is this?

2096
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:51,900
We can make a...

2097
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:54,220
We can make like a skate ramp.

2098
02:12:58,440 --> 02:12:59,260
And doors.

2099
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:02,960
What is this?

2100
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:07,780
There's so much here.

2101
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:12,420
Oh, that's how I turn things.

2102
02:13:12,460 --> 02:13:12,900
That's right.

2103
02:13:13,340 --> 02:13:14,460
Oops, oops, oops, oops.

2104
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:15,540
Too much turn.

2105
02:13:15,820 --> 02:13:16,680
Too much turning.

2106
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:18,820
There's

2107
02:13:21,910 --> 02:13:22,870
a way to do this.

2108
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:34,000
Yes, yes.

2109
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:35,680
And we'll give Matara this.

2110
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:38,140
Okay.

2111
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:43,680
So we want some windows.

2112
02:13:54,890 --> 02:13:56,850
Big window looking out front.

2113
02:13:57,770 --> 02:13:59,470
Me looking out to the side.

2114
02:14:00,050 --> 02:14:01,210
Me looking at Matara.

2115
02:14:03,670 --> 02:14:06,170
Why isn't this one so dark in here still?

2116
02:14:06,230 --> 02:14:06,890
I don't get it.

2117
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,480
This is so cute.

2118
02:14:13,480 --> 02:14:13,720
Cute.

2119
02:14:22,060 --> 02:14:25,360
You guys said last time there were not enough windows, so...

2120
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:26,920
You're welcome.

2121
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:31,300
You said...

2122
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:32,480
Mito, this sucks.

2123
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:33,680
There's not enough windows.

2124
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:37,740
Are the windows looking at the pool?

2125
02:14:38,120 --> 02:14:39,580
Oh yeah, we need those, don't we?

2126
02:14:43,460 --> 02:14:44,920
Can you do diagonal?

2127
02:14:45,140 --> 02:14:45,580
Oh nice.

2128
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:51,440
How do we get to the pool?

2129
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:55,700
Maybe from this right here.

2130
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:01,340
There's a little door right here and then we have a stair.

2131
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:05,440
Oh wait, maybe we do a ladder.

2132
02:15:06,020 --> 02:15:07,100
Actually, how do we do it?

2133
02:15:07,980 --> 02:15:08,880
How do you get in?

2134
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:13,960
Diving board from the second floor?

2135
02:15:14,440 --> 02:15:15,320
That's ridiculous.

2136
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:16,920
That's insanity.

2137
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:20,640
Actually, let's start making our houses.

2138
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:25,860
This is the kitchen.

2139
02:15:32,780 --> 02:15:34,020
My kitchen.

2140
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:40,660
Oh, must place under counter.

2141
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:42,240
Okay, I'll put a counter.

2142
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:43,720
Okay,

2143
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:48,280
alright, alright, alright.

2144
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:49,040
Alright, alright, alright.

2145
02:15:51,980 --> 02:15:54,260
Wow, I think I gave him too much money.

2146
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:57,660
I think I might have given him too much money.

2147
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:00,840
Because there's like a lot.

2148
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:06,480
Alright, Matara loves to cook everybody.

2149
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,400
This is just Matara's way of expressing that.

2150
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:15,020
Mito is the one to fill this dark house with wine.

2151
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:20,960
Ceiling light.

2152
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:24,500
This looks like cookies.

2153
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:29,260
Oh my god, it really lights up the room, huh?

2154
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:34,560
That's so cool.

2155
02:16:37,690 --> 02:16:40,290
Wow, the b-ball court is so crazy.

2156
02:16:42,990 --> 02:16:44,530
Oh, they need beds, don't they?

2157
02:16:44,570 --> 02:16:45,750
Okay, wait, this is bed.

2158
02:16:47,610 --> 02:16:49,790
Matara is on her way to 100 woohoo's.

2159
02:16:52,950 --> 02:16:54,390
She may regret them.

2160
02:16:54,510 --> 02:16:54,710
Why?

2161
02:16:54,810 --> 02:16:56,390
Why would I regret the light?

2162
02:16:59,750 --> 02:17:01,050
Why would I regret those?

2163
02:17:01,150 --> 02:17:01,770
What is this?

2164
02:17:03,830 --> 02:17:05,370
We cannot have that.

2165
02:17:05,970 --> 02:17:07,210
Especially for Matara.

2166
02:17:09,450 --> 02:17:12,310
Because she is not impregnable.

2167
02:17:17,580 --> 02:17:18,920
I would wish bad luck.

2168
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:20,300
Actually, I'll take this one though.

2169
02:17:30,590 --> 02:17:32,890
What should they do for fun?

2170
02:17:35,510 --> 02:17:36,350
Bonsen.

2171
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:39,190
So big.

2172
02:17:42,070 --> 02:17:43,190
Is this archery?

2173
02:17:44,070 --> 02:17:45,410
Oh, it's axe throwing.

2174
02:17:45,890 --> 02:17:46,210
What?

2175
02:17:46,570 --> 02:17:47,930
Must be placed outside.

2176
02:17:51,130 --> 02:17:52,310
What's this one?

2177
02:17:53,910 --> 02:17:55,010
Crafting it.

2178
02:17:57,070 --> 02:17:57,910
Formicarium.

2179
02:18:01,050 --> 02:18:02,970
I don't want to give too much stuff.

2180
02:18:04,570 --> 02:18:06,130
We'll figure it out later.

2181
02:18:06,370 --> 02:18:07,530
She's going to build her husband.

2182
02:18:09,530 --> 02:18:11,470
I'm officially an uncle!

2183
02:18:13,050 --> 02:18:14,710
Kizora, you're an uncle.

2184
02:18:15,090 --> 02:18:16,150
What do uncles do?

2185
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:20,350
What's like a real uncle-y type of thing?

2186
02:18:24,110 --> 02:18:25,630
What's an uncle thing?

2187
02:18:29,350 --> 02:18:29,910
Congratulations!

2188
02:18:33,810 --> 02:18:35,150
Drink and watch football.

2189
02:18:35,250 --> 02:18:36,370
Is that not a dad?

2190
02:18:37,710 --> 02:18:39,510
Can't anybody do that technically?

2191
02:18:39,810 --> 02:18:41,010
Okay, I kind of hate this wall.

2192
02:18:41,090 --> 02:18:41,910
It's limiting me.

2193
02:18:43,730 --> 02:18:47,310
It's limiting my success.

2194
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:49,710
What is this?

2195
02:18:50,930 --> 02:18:52,450
Oh, it's a bone rug.

2196
02:18:52,970 --> 02:18:54,530
Matara needs a bunch of these.

2197
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:00,060
Alright, Matara.

2198
02:19:01,220 --> 02:19:02,200
Subliminal messaging.

2199
02:19:12,140 --> 02:19:12,660
Alright,

2200
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:16,580
Matara.

2201
02:19:17,180 --> 02:19:18,340
You know what to do.

2202
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:19,720
You know what to do, girlfriend.

2203
02:19:20,740 --> 02:19:23,540
I think we need some plants for some life in this place.

2204
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:24,980
It's so dead in here.

2205
02:19:26,060 --> 02:19:27,920
We need a little bit of life.

2206
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:29,460
And everything.

2207
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:34,520
I'll figure out how to use the pool.

2208
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:36,780
I will figure it out.

2209
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:37,700
It's not Christmas.

2210
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:38,820
What am I doing?

2211
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:42,180
Wait, can I build a snowman?

2212
02:19:42,700 --> 02:19:43,540
That's so cute.

2213
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:51,100
What am I missing?

2214
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:51,740
Oh, bathroom.

2215
02:19:58,800 --> 02:19:59,840
They'll want...

2216
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:02,600
I don't want to get robbed.

2217
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:04,580
We need phones.

2218
02:20:05,140 --> 02:20:06,540
One on each side.

2219
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:10,900
Take your time.

2220
02:20:10,980 --> 02:20:11,880
Thank you!

2221
02:20:12,460 --> 02:20:15,660
It's been so long since I've played this game.

2222
02:20:15,820 --> 02:20:17,300
But we're figuring it out.

2223
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:18,460
We're getting pretty good.

2224
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:19,940
Let me save real quick.

2225
02:20:24,410 --> 02:20:26,110
And then a bathroom.

2226
02:20:28,130 --> 02:20:28,650
Wait.

2227
02:20:29,070 --> 02:20:29,510
Oh, bathroom.

2228
02:20:29,610 --> 02:20:29,930
Here we go.

2229
02:20:30,130 --> 02:20:31,130
Oh, and a shower.

2230
02:20:31,430 --> 02:20:32,530
Oh my gosh, how could I forget?

2231
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:36,130
Give her some privacy.

2232
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:47,760
Ooh, fancy.

2233
02:20:49,020 --> 02:20:49,980
Not fancy.

2234
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:52,200
And, oh, a sink.

2235
02:20:52,420 --> 02:20:54,980
Let's do a sink so that they can wash their hands.

2236
02:20:57,020 --> 02:20:59,120
And their stuff.

2237
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:06,050
How do I make it into the counter?

2238
02:21:06,590 --> 02:21:07,050
You know what?

2239
02:21:07,150 --> 02:21:07,610
It's fine.

2240
02:21:08,090 --> 02:21:08,930
We'll just do this.

2241
02:21:09,750 --> 02:21:11,590
And then also...

2242
02:21:11,590 --> 02:21:12,570
Do this.

2243
02:21:14,250 --> 02:21:15,430
Are we good to go?

2244
02:21:15,670 --> 02:21:16,750
A karaoke machine?

2245
02:21:17,790 --> 02:21:18,950
We can get that.

2246
02:21:19,450 --> 02:21:20,270
That sounds so fun.

2247
02:21:21,150 --> 02:21:22,110
Where would it be?

2248
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:24,250
Karaoke, karaoke, karaoke.

2249
02:21:27,350 --> 02:21:28,870
What the hell is this?

2250
02:21:30,430 --> 02:21:32,010
Electro dance sphere.

2251
02:21:33,030 --> 02:21:34,190
I want to try it.

2252
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:40,300
We have a fridge for each person.

2253
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:47,720
You should give them a coffee machine for the caffeine.

2254
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:50,660
We could do that.

2255
02:21:53,570 --> 02:21:56,850
I think Minto is missing a few countertops, no?

2256
02:21:58,590 --> 02:22:00,090
Which one did I give her before?

2257
02:22:01,390 --> 02:22:01,910
This one.

2258
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:07,780
Coffee machine.

2259
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:12,010
What is this?

2260
02:22:13,050 --> 02:22:14,770
The main squeezer.

2261
02:22:15,750 --> 02:22:16,390
Espresso.

2262
02:22:18,270 --> 02:22:19,390
That's not me.

2263
02:22:25,490 --> 02:22:27,990
Switch it up like Nintendo.

2264
02:22:30,830 --> 02:22:31,910
I don't see karaoke.

2265
02:22:35,470 --> 02:22:36,150
Dresser.

2266
02:22:44,260 --> 02:22:46,560
Switch it up like Minto.

2267
02:22:49,220 --> 02:22:50,520
We can't afford a car.

2268
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:51,280
That's okay.

2269
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:52,220
Maybe someday.

2270
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:53,640
What is this?

2271
02:22:57,650 --> 02:22:59,850
Can she play with that or is it for babies only?

2272
02:23:01,070 --> 02:23:02,570
I'll put it on Matara's side.

2273
02:23:05,030 --> 02:23:06,210
Alright, alright.

2274
02:23:06,370 --> 02:23:08,130
Oh wait, the cat, the cat, the cat.

2275
02:23:08,770 --> 02:23:09,710
Cat needs stuff.

2276
02:23:10,190 --> 02:23:11,610
The cat, the cat, the cat.

2277
02:23:12,190 --> 02:23:13,470
Cat needs litter box.

2278
02:23:15,270 --> 02:23:16,490
Cat needs bowl.

2279
02:23:17,730 --> 02:23:18,770
Cat needs...

2280
02:23:18,770 --> 02:23:19,450
What is this?

2281
02:23:20,150 --> 02:23:21,510
Dog pen, no?

2282
02:23:23,250 --> 02:23:23,890
Bed.

2283
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:33,820
Okay, that should be it.

2284
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:37,580
That should be good.

2285
02:23:38,440 --> 02:23:39,060
Shall we play?

2286
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:43,040
Back to...

2287
02:23:44,900 --> 02:23:45,540
Stop!

2288
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:47,340
Unstop time!

2289
02:23:49,580 --> 02:23:50,960
What did we just fulfill?

2290
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:52,360
Wait, we just fulfilled something.

2291
02:23:53,180 --> 02:23:53,780
What is it?

2292
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:05,680
No, no!

2293
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:06,820
What happened?

2294
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:10,720
Alright, Minto needs to go potty.

2295
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:14,760
Try out your new toilet.

2296
02:24:16,420 --> 02:24:17,620
It's really fancy.

2297
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:20,700
They have stairs.

2298
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:27,100
Oopsie, I messed up.

2299
02:24:28,600 --> 02:24:29,520
How?

2300
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:29,660
How?

2301
02:24:29,980 --> 02:24:31,540
Oh shoot.

2302
02:24:33,160 --> 02:24:35,200
Wait, how do they get inside?

2303
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:36,880
Wait.

2304
02:24:38,320 --> 02:24:38,940
Wait,

2305
02:24:43,380 --> 02:24:43,760
staircase.

2306
02:24:44,460 --> 02:24:45,260
But it doesn't work.

2307
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:47,880
How do they get inside?

2308
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:51,200
I should have never done the foundation.

2309
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:52,120
I'm a fool!

2310
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:54,160
Why did I do that?

2311
02:24:54,880 --> 02:24:55,620
Oh my gosh.

2312
02:24:55,620 --> 02:24:55,700
Oh my gosh.

2313
02:25:15,650 --> 02:25:17,390
Use mini stairs.

2314
02:25:19,630 --> 02:25:20,230
These?

2315
02:25:20,510 --> 02:25:23,830
Connecting stairs, railing...

2316
02:25:26,250 --> 02:25:28,590
There is no mini stairs!

2317
02:25:31,410 --> 02:25:32,990
What we could do is this.

2318
02:25:45,390 --> 02:25:46,430
Connecting stairs?

2319
02:25:46,770 --> 02:25:47,370
Will that work?

2320
02:25:47,570 --> 02:25:48,970
I tried it, but it didn't do anything.

2321
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:50,590
See?

2322
02:25:51,590 --> 02:25:53,750
Maybe I have to be here?

2323
02:25:54,890 --> 02:25:55,670
Like this?

2324
02:25:56,190 --> 02:25:56,530
Maybe?

2325
02:25:57,510 --> 02:25:59,550
What is this?

2326
02:25:59,670 --> 02:26:00,210
What's happening?

2327
02:26:02,410 --> 02:26:03,610
It went down.

2328
02:26:09,820 --> 02:26:11,120
NTR house?

2329
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:12,360
What are you talking about?

2330
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:13,320
No.

2331
02:26:15,780 --> 02:26:17,900
On the foundation itself.

2332
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:20,320
It won't let me.

2333
02:26:21,660 --> 02:26:23,840
Can't place bottom landing.

2334
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:28,620
Maybe it's the tile?

2335
02:26:32,910 --> 02:26:33,930
Let's try this.

2336
02:26:37,570 --> 02:26:38,170
No!

2337
02:26:43,160 --> 02:26:44,420
Guys, I messed up.

2338
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:45,820
Wait, what the heck is this?

2339
02:26:46,320 --> 02:26:47,160
Where did this come from?

2340
02:26:57,720 --> 02:26:59,080
I don't know what to do.

2341
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:04,600
Delete portions of the foundation.

2342
02:27:05,380 --> 02:27:07,320
The staircase is too long.

2343
02:27:07,860 --> 02:27:11,100
Wait, foundation.

2344
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:19,320
Like that.

2345
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:21,300
And then we do the stair.

2346
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:25,320
Oh my god, it works!

2347
02:27:26,260 --> 02:27:27,500
Thank you!

2348
02:27:28,420 --> 02:27:30,280
I was so scared for a second.

2349
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:33,880
It worked!

2350
02:27:35,060 --> 02:27:35,780
It worked!

2351
02:27:35,860 --> 02:27:37,580
Oh my gosh, I remember in the old game.

2352
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:40,520
You used to be able to go to the top of the screen and it would move.

2353
02:27:40,820 --> 02:27:42,380
But now I have to right click everything.

2354
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:43,720
How are you doing Matara?

2355
02:27:43,880 --> 02:27:45,000
Oh you also have to go to the bathroom.

2356
02:27:46,120 --> 02:27:47,340
Go into your own house.

2357
02:27:49,580 --> 02:27:50,300
And Cheezy.

2358
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:53,140
Cheezy is going in!

2359
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:54,320
There he goes!

2360
02:27:54,680 --> 02:27:56,840
They each have their own side.

2361
02:28:00,860 --> 02:28:02,480
No Cheezy no!

2362
02:28:02,740 --> 02:28:03,560
Cheezy no!

2363
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:05,460
That's my bed Cheezy!

2364
02:28:05,720 --> 02:28:06,660
Cheezy no!

2365
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:09,840
Cheezy!

2366
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:11,400
Don't destroy the...

2367
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:15,560
I like how Cheezy walked up to Minto to get scolded.

2368
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:17,280
No!

2369
02:28:17,700 --> 02:28:18,960
Destroying the furniture!

2370
02:28:20,820 --> 02:28:23,880
Oh my god, Matara is already coming over.

2371
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:25,280
What are you doing?

2372
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:27,060
I don't want you over here in my house.

2373
02:28:27,420 --> 02:28:28,420
Get out of here!

2374
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:31,700
And now she hates it!

2375
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:33,400
What do you mean?

2376
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:34,400
Why are you complaining?

2377
02:28:34,580 --> 02:28:35,360
It's not your house.

2378
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,740
We have a Mr. Humble here.

2379
02:28:57,540 --> 02:29:01,020
Minto is throwing up on the carpet, but she got some gains.

2380
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:06,400
Monty!

2381
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:12,360
So cute!

2382
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:14,060
OK, Matara, you go.

2383
02:29:14,660 --> 02:29:16,640
We are going to have you... Oh, open up the present.

2384
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:17,920
What is this?

2385
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:19,940
We have the garden club coming over.

2386
02:29:20,340 --> 02:29:21,000
Hello Tiffany.

2387
02:29:21,700 --> 02:29:23,820
Oh my god, it's...

2388
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:26,720
She knocked and then...

2389
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:27,700
What did you give us?

2390
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:28,520
Oh, a computer!

2391
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:29,480
Thank you!

2392
02:29:29,720 --> 02:29:30,660
Wait, talk to this lady.

2393
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:33,680
What's up?

2394
02:29:42,460 --> 02:29:45,020
Why does everyone hate the orb?

2395
02:29:49,140 --> 02:29:51,320
Look, she already has a woohoo.

2396
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:53,720
Tiffany is into it.

2397
02:29:54,820 --> 02:29:56,180
Oh my god!

2398
02:29:56,980 --> 02:29:58,640
Tiffany is into it!

2399
02:30:00,040 --> 02:30:01,480
Why did she just do that?

2400
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:06,300
No Cheesy, no!

2401
02:30:06,760 --> 02:30:08,260
No Chucky Cheesy!

2402
02:30:12,220 --> 02:30:14,660
I think they are going to be into it.

2403
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:18,000
Is she woohoo with the grandma?

2404
02:30:27,140 --> 02:30:29,720
I don't think it's going to happen guys.

2405
02:30:31,480 --> 02:30:35,200
What does licknarb mean?

2406
02:30:39,410 --> 02:30:40,130
Where are you going?

2407
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:42,150
Tell a joke?

2408
02:30:43,330 --> 02:30:45,970
This lady just invited herself into our house.

2409
02:30:46,830 --> 02:30:48,030
Excuse me ma'am.

2410
02:30:49,290 --> 02:30:50,230
The Sims is crazy.

2411
02:30:55,010 --> 02:30:56,830
I'm going to get rid of this wall.

2412
02:30:56,990 --> 02:30:58,310
I can't see anything.

2413
02:30:58,910 --> 02:30:59,290
You know?

2414
02:31:00,490 --> 02:31:01,650
Like all this.

2415
02:31:02,390 --> 02:31:03,890
I can't see anything.

2416
02:31:04,270 --> 02:31:05,410
It's blocking it.

2417
02:31:05,490 --> 02:31:06,310
It's so ugly.

2418
02:31:09,630 --> 02:31:11,510
You can lock doors?

2419
02:31:11,590 --> 02:31:11,990
I can?

2420
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:17,620
Lock the door.

2421
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:18,300
Oh, go here?

2422
02:31:18,900 --> 02:31:20,760
Did she just salute like she's a captain?

2423
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:23,320
Oh no, you have to make some food!

2424
02:31:24,460 --> 02:31:26,280
Make a group meal.

2425
02:31:26,540 --> 02:31:28,640
She's going to make mac and cheese.

2426
02:31:28,640 --> 02:31:30,960
No, don't read.

2427
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:32,080
Don't do that.

2428
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:36,520
Praise for yowling.

2429
02:31:39,260 --> 02:31:40,540
Who the hell are you?

2430
02:31:40,680 --> 02:31:41,600
Jenny Smith?

2431
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:43,380
Everybody is coming...

2432
02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:50,620
Why does everyone look like this?

2433
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:52,040
Everybody is so slouchy.

2434
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:53,580
Why are they like this?

2435
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:55,220
Why is everybody so slouchy?

2436
02:31:55,460 --> 02:31:57,280
Why is everybody at our house?

2437
02:31:59,340 --> 02:32:02,560
I'm going to have... I'm going to have you make a robot.

2438
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:03,980
Wait, only a toy robot?

2439
02:32:05,140 --> 02:32:06,200
You think she'll still like it?

2440
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:07,520
Customize my robot.

2441
02:32:09,860 --> 02:32:11,480
What should the robot's name be?

2442
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:14,120
Zombie?

2443
02:32:14,260 --> 02:32:15,220
No, he's an alien.

2444
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:23,060
Zeke?

2445
02:32:25,220 --> 02:32:25,660
Rex?

2446
02:32:26,980 --> 02:32:28,220
Rex Robot.

2447
02:32:29,420 --> 02:32:32,080
Metal Gear reference.

2448
02:32:37,380 --> 02:32:39,560
Lady just used my toilet.

2449
02:32:39,980 --> 02:32:40,660
Get out of here.

2450
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:41,720
Go away Tiffany.

2451
02:32:43,300 --> 02:32:44,280
How is Matara doing?

2452
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:44,840
She's cooking.

2453
02:32:45,780 --> 02:32:46,980
She's cooking well.

2454
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:51,900
Crabs?

2455
02:32:51,980 --> 02:32:53,020
No, it's mac and cheese.

2456
02:32:53,540 --> 02:32:54,120
It's not crabs.

2457
02:32:55,660 --> 02:32:59,300
So buy a sculpture costing at least that much.

2458
02:32:59,500 --> 02:33:00,220
A painting.

2459
02:33:02,360 --> 02:33:03,380
Can she dance here?

2460
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:03,680
No.

2461
02:33:05,900 --> 02:33:07,260
Another cat.

2462
02:33:09,700 --> 02:33:10,920
Sake the cat.

2463
02:33:15,900 --> 02:33:19,180
She's really into making that robot.

2464
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:21,740
Do not let her cook.

2465
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:23,480
It's horrible.

2466
02:33:26,300 --> 02:33:27,900
She finished it!

2467
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:32,120
Time to eat.

2468
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:35,880
I think she's throwing up.

2469
02:33:37,420 --> 02:33:39,360
I think she's saying it's really horrible.

2470
02:33:43,450 --> 02:33:44,750
She finished it though.

2471
02:33:45,670 --> 02:33:46,730
I didn't mean to do that.

2472
02:33:46,990 --> 02:33:47,970
I want to greet the cat.

2473
02:33:48,050 --> 02:33:48,810
Is the cat still here?

2474
02:33:49,090 --> 02:33:50,030
Who the hell are you?

2475
02:33:57,830 --> 02:33:59,290
She is a good friend.

2476
02:34:01,450 --> 02:34:03,430
She's walking all the way over here.

2477
02:34:04,290 --> 02:34:05,690
This lady is still here.

2478
02:34:05,830 --> 02:34:06,870
Tiffany, go home.

2479
02:34:07,490 --> 02:34:09,370
This is not your retirement home.

2480
02:34:09,490 --> 02:34:09,890
Please.

2481
02:34:11,970 --> 02:34:13,070
Hot lady.

2482
02:34:13,750 --> 02:34:15,310
I'm supposed to say hello to Michelle.

2483
02:34:19,730 --> 02:34:20,930
Hello Michelle.

2484
02:34:22,990 --> 02:34:23,490
Okay.

2485
02:34:28,890 --> 02:34:29,390
Propose?

2486
02:34:29,590 --> 02:34:29,870
Give?

2487
02:34:30,010 --> 02:34:30,310
Pet?

2488
02:34:30,490 --> 02:34:31,890
No, I'm not giving up Chucky.

2489
02:34:32,450 --> 02:34:33,890
Why would I do that?

2490
02:34:36,410 --> 02:34:37,930
Tiffany's children don't...

2491
02:34:39,530 --> 02:34:43,190
We are going to entertain her with a joke.

2492
02:34:43,810 --> 02:34:45,130
I think we just did that.

2493
02:34:45,230 --> 02:34:47,790
Oh my gosh, we are a natural comedian.

2494
02:34:50,930 --> 02:34:51,210
Oh.

2495
02:34:58,530 --> 02:35:01,050
How does this thing exercise you?

2496
02:35:01,930 --> 02:35:04,090
Have I drowned anyone in the pool yet?

2497
02:35:04,630 --> 02:35:05,950
I can't get to the pool.

2498
02:35:06,550 --> 02:35:07,170
Oh wait!

2499
02:35:07,590 --> 02:35:09,210
Now I know how to build the stairs.

2500
02:35:13,570 --> 02:35:15,270
Oh it's not big enough.

2501
02:35:16,050 --> 02:35:16,990
Oh no!

2502
02:35:17,990 --> 02:35:21,170
I messed up!

2503
02:35:22,150 --> 02:35:27,140
What do I do?

2504
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:30,800
I make the pool smaller.

2505
02:35:32,060 --> 02:35:33,440
That will fix it.

2506
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:37,760
That will fix the problem.

2507
02:35:38,840 --> 02:35:40,620
No more pool here.

2508
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:44,060
Get rid of the pool.

2509
02:35:45,440 --> 02:35:47,940
They need a way to swim.

2510
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:52,200
Like that.

2511
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:53,260
Nice.

2512
02:35:55,460 --> 02:35:58,140
Get rid of the pool.

2513
02:36:00,140 --> 02:36:01,460
Let's delete ladder.

2514
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:02,460
Wait, what?

2515
02:36:06,320 --> 02:36:07,080
Nice!

2516
02:36:15,060 --> 02:36:16,880
Oh wait, oh no.

2517
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:20,460
I have to delete more pool.

2518
02:36:27,110 --> 02:36:30,790
Okay, now we add more foundation.

2519
02:36:31,630 --> 02:36:36,510
Foundation is literally causing so much grief for us.

2520
02:36:43,590 --> 02:36:46,130
It's the worst ever.

2521
02:36:51,870 --> 02:36:53,990
Now they can go swimming!

2522
02:36:59,590 --> 02:37:04,000
I think Matara is about to die.

2523
02:37:06,040 --> 02:37:07,380
Matara, go for a swim.

2524
02:37:11,240 --> 02:37:12,340
There she goes.

2525
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:19,680
Oh, I think I just saw Chucky Cheesy on the counter.

2526
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,280
What are you doing in there girl?

2527
02:37:24,360 --> 02:37:26,120
She just wanted a little bit of a bath.

2528
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:38,120
Wow, she liked it.

2529
02:37:38,220 --> 02:37:38,840
It worked!

2530
02:37:38,840 --> 02:37:41,320
The pool worked everybody!

2531
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:47,260
Why is she standing there?

2532
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:49,100
What?

2533
02:37:50,060 --> 02:37:51,820
What do you mean by that?

2534
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:56,440
Oh, okay.

2535
02:37:57,860 --> 02:37:59,160
This is fine.

2536
02:37:59,720 --> 02:38:02,620
Can we change appearance now?

2537
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:04,840
Can we get the special hair colors?

2538
02:38:05,500 --> 02:38:06,440
We can!

2539
02:38:07,260 --> 02:38:08,080
Look at that.

2540
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:08,620
See?

2541
02:38:10,180 --> 02:38:11,840
What is this?

2542
02:38:12,400 --> 02:38:13,280
Excuse me?

2543
02:38:15,420 --> 02:38:17,020
What is this?

2544
02:38:18,180 --> 02:38:20,400
Is my culture a joke to you?

2545
02:38:21,860 --> 02:38:23,560
Oh, everything sucks.

2546
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:25,660
Nothing works.

2547
02:38:26,740 --> 02:38:28,000
It's all horrible.

2548
02:38:28,900 --> 02:38:30,300
Why is it all so bad?

2549
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:39,200
Guys, I think we are not going to be able to change our appearance.

2550
02:38:39,960 --> 02:38:42,360
Not the fake ears.

2551
02:38:43,180 --> 02:38:44,560
It's so bad.

2552
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:48,080
It's so bad.

2553
02:38:52,480 --> 02:38:53,260
Nevermind.

2554
02:38:54,260 --> 02:38:57,340
We could give Matara a little pixie cut though.

2555
02:38:58,400 --> 02:39:00,820
I wish they gave you sliders for all the hairstyles.

2556
02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:01,360
I know!

2557
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:03,320
I don't understand why they don't.

2558
02:39:03,420 --> 02:39:04,840
What are they doing?

2559
02:39:04,980 --> 02:39:06,520
They are not having a good time.

2560
02:39:06,580 --> 02:39:07,260
That's what they are doing.

2561
02:39:09,580 --> 02:39:11,680
They are talking about gnomes.

2562
02:39:12,300 --> 02:39:13,400
My hair is only for elder.

2563
02:39:13,800 --> 02:39:15,260
That's so messed up.

2564
02:39:21,940 --> 02:39:24,820
Okay, let's see what Minto wants.

2565
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:27,880
She wants a painting costing at least 500 simoleons.

2566
02:39:28,340 --> 02:39:30,960
Her fear is being barked or hissed at by Chucky.

2567
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:31,740
No!

2568
02:39:33,340 --> 02:39:34,000
Sculpture.

2569
02:39:34,820 --> 02:39:35,860
Earn some money.

2570
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:37,280
Earn a hundred.

2571
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:42,020
We got to get Matara to woohoo.

2572
02:39:42,020 --> 02:39:44,480
She also wants a job in music.

2573
02:39:45,540 --> 02:39:46,820
And she wants a bar.

2574
02:39:46,860 --> 02:39:48,040
This is literally her.

2575
02:39:48,320 --> 02:39:49,020
Am I...

2576
02:39:49,020 --> 02:39:54,100
Ma'am, did you...

2577
02:39:55,680 --> 02:39:57,240
They are talking about ghosts.

2578
02:39:57,740 --> 02:39:59,020
They are talking about...

2579
02:40:04,580 --> 02:40:05,160
Boob.

2580
02:40:07,580 --> 02:40:08,160
Boob.

2581
02:40:11,420 --> 02:40:12,180
Don't throw up.

2582
02:40:12,680 --> 02:40:13,540
Don't throw up, Michelle.

2583
02:40:14,020 --> 02:40:15,020
Don't throw up on the carpet.

2584
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:24,460
Boob.

2585
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:32,100
Where is... Okay, he is being a good boy.

2586
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:33,700
I kind of love the cat.

2587
02:40:37,540 --> 02:40:38,100
Chucky.

2588
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:39,060
Chucky cheesy.

2589
02:40:39,420 --> 02:40:41,100
What does this mean, I wonder.

2590
02:40:43,620 --> 02:40:44,820
We are going to give love.

2591
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:47,460
We are going to hug the cat.

2592
02:40:48,420 --> 02:40:49,800
Stop talking to Matara.

2593
02:40:50,200 --> 02:40:51,120
It's disgusting.

2594
02:40:51,560 --> 02:40:52,280
What the hell was that?

2595
02:40:56,700 --> 02:40:59,340
Everyone who eats is going to throw up and die.

2596
02:40:59,340 --> 02:41:03,460
Go take a shower, girl.

2597
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:05,760
You are disgusting.

2598
02:41:06,080 --> 02:41:06,620
Where are you going?

2599
02:41:07,180 --> 02:41:07,680
Shooed?

2600
02:41:08,480 --> 02:41:09,460
Why are you getting shooed?

2601
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:10,200
By who?

2602
02:41:16,140 --> 02:41:17,840
What's wrong with the environment?

2603
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:19,240
Wait, what's going on?

2604
02:41:19,460 --> 02:41:20,540
Why is everything bad?

2605
02:41:20,780 --> 02:41:22,840
Wait, you guys, what am I messing up?

2606
02:41:23,160 --> 02:41:23,880
What's happening?

2607
02:41:24,520 --> 02:41:25,960
Tell her to go home, please.

2608
02:41:26,060 --> 02:41:27,580
Say goodbye to everyone.

2609
02:41:29,340 --> 02:41:30,220
What's happening?

2610
02:41:32,260 --> 02:41:33,780
Why is she so upset?

2611
02:41:35,240 --> 02:41:37,380
Why is the environment so bad?

2612
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:45,620
The smelly food?

2613
02:41:45,820 --> 02:41:46,240
Maybe.

2614
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:48,760
You need to decorate.

2615
02:41:48,900 --> 02:41:50,720
Oh my god, so cute.

2616
02:41:51,220 --> 02:41:52,760
I love him so much.

2617
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:58,340
What are you yelling about?

2618
02:42:02,260 --> 02:42:03,820
She just growled at her?

2619
02:42:05,160 --> 02:42:06,840
I think it's the stinky food.

2620
02:42:07,540 --> 02:42:08,660
She's going to throw it away.

2621
02:42:09,160 --> 02:42:10,480
She's taking care of it.

2622
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:13,980
Are you hungry, Matara?

2623
02:42:14,360 --> 02:42:15,600
You need to pee a little?

2624
02:42:16,800 --> 02:42:17,200
Go pee.

2625
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:22,340
And you are also going to call...

2626
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:25,060
You are going to throw a party.

2627
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:27,680
You are going to throw a house party.

2628
02:42:29,900 --> 02:42:31,980
Why did you leave that on the ground?

2629
02:42:32,140 --> 02:42:33,460
She is so disgusting.

2630
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:38,580
What did you hear?

2631
02:42:46,880 --> 02:42:48,340
Are you okay?

2632
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:49,920
She's probably fine.

2633
02:42:51,820 --> 02:42:53,480
Matara said, whoa chat.

2634
02:42:53,480 --> 02:42:53,940
Alright,

2635
02:42:58,060 --> 02:43:01,420
she's going to throw a house party and she's going to get some guys here.

2636
02:43:01,560 --> 02:43:02,620
She's going to be like...

2637
02:43:02,620 --> 02:43:05,780
Get the girls together in this game.

2638
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:07,240
Oh my god.

2639
02:43:07,540 --> 02:43:08,500
Party with Tiffany!

2640
02:43:14,520 --> 02:43:16,440
The guests are invited.

2641
02:43:19,140 --> 02:43:20,420
Don't worry about it.

2642
02:43:20,680 --> 02:43:23,840
Have a snack of some chips.

2643
02:43:26,320 --> 02:43:27,920
And then go to sleep.

2644
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:30,380
It's already 9PM.

2645
02:43:31,220 --> 02:43:32,320
Alright Matara, what are you doing?

2646
02:43:32,920 --> 02:43:34,760
You are going to...

2647
02:43:34,760 --> 02:43:38,800
You are going to make many... No.

2648
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:43,600
Make a single plate of cereal.

2649
02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:44,800
You can't ruin that.

2650
02:43:46,300 --> 02:43:47,760
I'm not crying in the bathroom.

2651
02:43:52,140 --> 02:43:53,320
Everything is fine.

2652
02:43:53,420 --> 02:43:54,960
She's going to make many babies.

2653
02:43:55,820 --> 02:43:56,620
What else?

2654
02:43:57,020 --> 02:43:58,460
Minto is unhappy.

2655
02:43:58,580 --> 02:44:00,500
Maybe she wants some more entertainment.

2656
02:44:03,300 --> 02:44:06,180
Maybe... I couldn't use this area very much before.

2657
02:44:06,300 --> 02:44:07,960
Maybe she wants...

2658
02:44:11,740 --> 02:44:13,860
A drum set.

2659
02:44:14,300 --> 02:44:15,480
That's fun.

2660
02:44:16,240 --> 02:44:17,960
Maybe she wants...

2661
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,040
A pinball machine.

2662
02:44:23,640 --> 02:44:24,840
That's fun.

2663
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:30,380
She wants... We are going to give her the biggest TV.

2664
02:44:31,460 --> 02:44:31,840
Oh wait.

2665
02:44:31,900 --> 02:44:32,800
She also wanted paintings.

2666
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:33,280
That's right.

2667
02:44:33,640 --> 02:44:34,700
She wanted paintings.

2668
02:44:35,580 --> 02:44:36,900
Paintings are expensive.

2669
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:42,040
That one is probably pricey.

2670
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:43,300
I didn't look at it.

2671
02:44:43,700 --> 02:44:44,220
Never mind.

2672
02:44:44,480 --> 02:44:45,040
It's $55.

2673
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:46,540
$40.

2674
02:44:47,220 --> 02:44:47,820
$40.

2675
02:44:48,520 --> 02:44:49,120
$70.

2676
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:50,760
$75.

2677
02:44:50,760 --> 02:44:51,200
$75.

2678
02:44:51,620 --> 02:44:52,260
$79.

2679
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:53,140
$85.

2680
02:44:53,740 --> 02:44:54,260
$88.

2681
02:44:58,640 --> 02:44:59,520
There we go.

2682
02:45:00,020 --> 02:45:00,660
Perfect.

2683
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:03,120
And... Oh wait.

2684
02:45:03,260 --> 02:45:04,680
Was it... It was $500?

2685
02:45:08,460 --> 02:45:09,100
Okay.

2686
02:45:09,140 --> 02:45:11,080
We will just keep going higher and higher.

2687
02:45:13,920 --> 02:45:15,060
Poisonous forest.

2688
02:45:15,880 --> 02:45:17,380
In love with a curse.

2689
02:45:18,760 --> 02:45:19,400
Sure.

2690
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:21,700
And then let's give her a little couch.

2691
02:45:24,380 --> 02:45:25,720
Oh I like the lips.

2692
02:45:28,240 --> 02:45:29,780
Now she can watch TV.

2693
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:34,160
Environment up.

2694
02:45:38,810 --> 02:45:39,970
Environment up.

2695
02:45:40,450 --> 02:45:40,890
Wait.

2696
02:45:40,950 --> 02:45:42,050
What do you mean it's party time?

2697
02:45:42,570 --> 02:45:43,950
It's literally 9pm.

2698
02:45:44,050 --> 02:45:44,810
What are you talking about?

2699
02:45:50,060 --> 02:45:51,580
I think they are losing it.

2700
02:45:55,460 --> 02:45:58,580
We have like a little bit of fireflies right here.

2701
02:45:59,500 --> 02:46:00,680
Hunt bugs.

2702
02:46:05,220 --> 02:46:06,840
What are you upset about?

2703
02:46:07,360 --> 02:46:08,840
I've done everything for you.

2704
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:10,480
Why are you upset?

2705
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:12,740
Matara Khan, please don't be so picky.

2706
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:17,580
I don't know what Minto is doing.

2707
02:46:20,440 --> 02:46:22,960
I think... I think you should go to bed.

2708
02:46:24,480 --> 02:46:25,820
Sleep in pajamas.

2709
02:46:27,080 --> 02:46:27,840
What?

2710
02:46:28,180 --> 02:46:29,300
They say clean!

2711
02:46:29,720 --> 02:46:30,680
What's dirty?

2712
02:46:30,840 --> 02:46:31,400
What's dirty?

2713
02:46:31,960 --> 02:46:34,220
There's...aww Chucky Cheese is asleep.

2714
02:46:34,400 --> 02:46:35,360
He's so cute.

2715
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:37,980
What is...what is dirty?

2716
02:46:38,220 --> 02:46:38,860
What is dirty?

2717
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:42,880
Is this dirty?

2718
02:46:46,600 --> 02:46:48,660
Matara, don't eat here.

2719
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:51,860
Oh wait, the water maybe.

2720
02:46:51,860 --> 02:46:51,960
Maybe.

2721
02:46:57,200 --> 02:46:57,940
Ok yeah.

2722
02:46:58,740 --> 02:47:00,200
You take it to your place.

2723
02:47:01,020 --> 02:47:02,200
There she goes.

2724
02:47:02,400 --> 02:47:04,040
I don't think Tiffany is coming over.

2725
02:47:06,340 --> 02:47:08,920
I don't think Tiffany is coming over you guys.

2726
02:47:12,880 --> 02:47:14,520
I don't think she is coming over.

2727
02:47:14,880 --> 02:47:15,880
Wait, what about the party?

2728
02:47:16,580 --> 02:47:17,700
We still have an hour.

2729
02:47:18,780 --> 02:47:22,920
And the party is...oh the party score is disaster.

2730
02:47:25,860 --> 02:47:27,040
Wait, who woke up?

2731
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:31,140
Chucky woke up?

2732
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:33,600
Is that why the time stopped?

2733
02:47:36,340 --> 02:47:37,660
Minto is doing pretty well.

2734
02:47:37,740 --> 02:47:39,520
Matara is kind of losing it.

2735
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:42,860
No one seems to be having fun at this party.

2736
02:47:42,980 --> 02:47:43,860
Next time take back...

2737
02:47:43,860 --> 02:47:45,420
There is nobody here!

2738
02:47:47,180 --> 02:47:48,460
What do you mean?

2739
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:49,020
Uh oh.

2740
02:47:50,680 --> 02:47:51,240
Chucky!

2741
02:47:51,920 --> 02:47:53,920
You bad boy, you!

2742
02:47:54,220 --> 02:47:55,700
No, that's bad food!

2743
02:47:57,980 --> 02:47:59,040
No, Shillam!

2744
02:47:59,780 --> 02:48:00,980
Get out of that thing!

2745
02:48:01,020 --> 02:48:01,940
What the hell are you doing?

2746
02:48:02,080 --> 02:48:04,020
Why are you up on this thing at 3am?

2747
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:07,140
She is actually psychotic you guys.

2748
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:10,940
She is psychotic!

2749
02:48:12,320 --> 02:48:14,660
Get him away from the stinky food.

2750
02:48:16,940 --> 02:48:18,320
Now she is crying.

2751
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:33,800
She got fit.

2752
02:48:34,220 --> 02:48:35,740
Alright, clean up the food please.

2753
02:48:37,720 --> 02:48:38,960
What is happening?

2754
02:48:41,360 --> 02:48:43,820
He ate the nasty food and threw up.

2755
02:48:43,840 --> 02:48:45,280
This is all your fault Matara.

2756
02:48:45,280 --> 02:48:47,720
I like watching him just wander around.

2757
02:48:48,020 --> 02:48:48,900
It's pretty good.

2758
02:48:50,700 --> 02:48:52,060
She is hungry.

2759
02:48:52,360 --> 02:48:53,120
Ok, eat up.

2760
02:48:53,280 --> 02:48:54,080
Eat up Matara.

2761
02:48:55,300 --> 02:48:56,580
And also Chucky.

2762
02:48:58,820 --> 02:49:00,600
Does he not have food?

2763
02:49:01,060 --> 02:49:04,520
I guess she has to fill the bowl.

2764
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:06,160
He is starving!

2765
02:49:06,300 --> 02:49:07,680
I'm starving the cat!

2766
02:49:09,440 --> 02:49:11,860
Why are they so obsessed with the orb?

2767
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:12,820
I don't understand.

2768
02:49:19,160 --> 02:49:20,840
Oh, I think it's broken.

2769
02:49:22,200 --> 02:49:24,760
Alright, she didn't see that he ate out of it.

2770
02:49:24,780 --> 02:49:25,520
So it's probably ok.

2771
02:49:26,700 --> 02:49:27,720
Stop talking to her.

2772
02:49:28,260 --> 02:49:29,160
Why is she in your house?

2773
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:31,460
Alright, what is this?

2774
02:49:31,580 --> 02:49:32,580
Gain a skill point.

2775
02:49:32,860 --> 02:49:35,160
Get a bronze robotics talent badge.

2776
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:37,320
That's the turn on baby.

2777
02:49:38,260 --> 02:49:39,940
We need to get more people here.

2778
02:49:40,120 --> 02:49:42,660
How do we make friends in this game?

2779
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,120
How do you make friends in this game?

2780
02:49:47,540 --> 02:49:53,420
Yeah, ignore any ounce of... you know... anything.

2781
02:49:54,040 --> 02:49:54,740
Advertising?

2782
02:49:56,180 --> 02:49:57,720
What is he going after?

2783
02:49:58,420 --> 02:49:58,700
Is he ok?

2784
02:50:03,400 --> 02:50:04,160
No!

2785
02:50:04,700 --> 02:50:05,100
Chucky!

2786
02:50:08,600 --> 02:50:10,320
He killed the pet!

2787
02:50:10,320 --> 02:50:10,520
He broke my bed!

2788
02:50:17,440 --> 02:50:23,060
Chucky Cheese just broke my bed!

2789
02:50:26,500 --> 02:50:30,320
Oh my gosh, she is so anal.

2790
02:50:32,360 --> 02:50:34,980
I think I need to buy another bed.

2791
02:50:36,320 --> 02:50:37,740
What's this one?

2792
02:50:39,140 --> 02:50:40,140
Fancy!

2793
02:50:42,440 --> 02:50:44,440
Alright, and also clean that up ma'am.

2794
02:50:48,920 --> 02:50:50,320
I can't believe it.

2795
02:50:50,620 --> 02:50:51,880
I can't believe it either.

2796
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:58,860
Oh yeah, let's get her out of her pajamas so we can get her... practice romance?

2797
02:51:00,560 --> 02:51:02,480
Wait, I think Matara needs that the most.

2798
02:51:02,560 --> 02:51:02,840
Hold on.

2799
02:51:18,860 --> 02:51:20,160
There's another Zubat?

2800
02:51:37,970 --> 02:51:39,510
There's people here!

2801
02:51:42,750 --> 02:51:43,710
Gussy up!

2802
02:51:44,030 --> 02:51:45,770
Is that how you get ready?

2803
02:51:46,310 --> 02:51:46,990
Gussy up?

2804
02:51:48,650 --> 02:51:49,850
Stop doing that please.

2805
02:51:52,290 --> 02:51:54,650
Change... wait, how do you... oh wait, wait, wait.

2806
02:51:54,950 --> 02:51:56,230
I know how to get it.

2807
02:51:56,410 --> 02:51:57,090
I know how to do it.

2808
02:51:57,870 --> 02:51:58,230
Wait!

2809
02:51:58,530 --> 02:51:59,510
Say hi to this guy!

2810
02:52:00,490 --> 02:52:01,390
It's for Matara!

2811
02:52:01,550 --> 02:52:02,750
Ok, he just came inside.

2812
02:52:02,890 --> 02:52:03,450
Alright, we're good.

2813
02:52:03,870 --> 02:52:05,590
Alright, change into everyday.

2814
02:52:09,870 --> 02:52:11,790
Matara, you need to go talk to this guy.

2815
02:52:12,230 --> 02:52:13,110
Go here, go here.

2816
02:52:13,890 --> 02:52:15,010
Alright, we'll talk to him.

2817
02:52:15,010 --> 02:52:15,990
Talk?

2818
02:52:16,390 --> 02:52:17,510
Wait, flirt?

2819
02:52:18,190 --> 02:52:18,750
Wolf whistle.

2820
02:52:18,910 --> 02:52:20,290
Yeah, go do that.

2821
02:52:20,910 --> 02:52:22,130
Oh, he liked it.

2822
02:52:22,270 --> 02:52:24,110
Ok, friendly hug.

2823
02:52:24,390 --> 02:52:25,110
Friendly hug.

2824
02:52:26,370 --> 02:52:27,330
She's stinky.

2825
02:52:27,530 --> 02:52:28,310
It's fine though.

2826
02:52:30,720 --> 02:52:31,310
No, no, no.

2827
02:52:32,470 --> 02:52:34,730
Friendly hug the man, not the cat.

2828
02:52:34,730 --> 02:52:34,790
Cat.

2829
02:52:41,030 --> 02:52:42,510
Well, you're going to charm him.

2830
02:52:42,690 --> 02:52:44,770
He likes her!

2831
02:52:45,030 --> 02:52:47,970
Oh my gosh, he likes her even though she smells bad.

2832
02:52:48,250 --> 02:52:48,730
It's fine.

2833
02:52:49,170 --> 02:52:51,270
Girl smell, girl smell, boy smell.

2834
02:52:52,810 --> 02:52:54,470
Wait, I thought you liked her.

2835
02:52:55,410 --> 02:52:56,090
Ok, hold on.

2836
02:52:57,110 --> 02:52:57,870
Hang out?

2837
02:52:58,310 --> 02:52:59,210
You want to hang out?

2838
02:52:59,390 --> 02:53:00,750
Look at them, they're hanging out.

2839
02:53:03,030 --> 02:53:04,730
What is this?

2840
02:53:04,810 --> 02:53:07,030
She wants to buy a love potion?

2841
02:53:14,250 --> 02:53:17,570
See guys, even... Oh my gosh, she didn't even flush.

2842
02:53:17,790 --> 02:53:18,590
Matara is so gross.

2843
02:53:19,030 --> 02:53:23,190
Even Matara Khan gets rejected for hugs and flirts.

2844
02:53:24,130 --> 02:53:24,490
You know?

2845
02:53:26,470 --> 02:53:28,750
That's not stink, that's aura.

2846
02:53:29,430 --> 02:53:30,310
Yeah, look at them.

2847
02:53:30,390 --> 02:53:31,510
Oh, they're hanging out.

2848
02:53:31,610 --> 02:53:32,790
They're having a good time.

2849
02:53:32,910 --> 02:53:35,950
She's like my big old bug eyes.

2850
02:53:36,370 --> 02:53:37,530
I'm bugging out.

2851
02:53:37,610 --> 02:53:39,250
She's literally talking to him in her underwear.

2852
02:53:39,690 --> 02:53:40,810
I just realized.

2853
02:53:43,130 --> 02:53:44,830
She's talking to him in her underwear.

2854
02:53:46,730 --> 02:53:47,350
Yeah, she is.

2855
02:53:47,430 --> 02:53:49,250
You can bug me anytime.

2856
02:53:51,430 --> 02:53:53,210
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

2857
02:53:54,990 --> 02:53:57,650
I don't know how to get to the...

2858
02:53:59,590 --> 02:54:04,430
We're going to make many group... make... not many.

2859
02:54:05,550 --> 02:54:07,430
Make... have lunch.

2860
02:54:07,850 --> 02:54:08,890
No, not TV dinner.

2861
02:54:09,390 --> 02:54:12,630
Make a group meal, mac and cheese.

2862
02:54:13,730 --> 02:54:15,090
No, don't make that.

2863
02:54:15,570 --> 02:54:16,470
Actually, you know what?

2864
02:54:16,510 --> 02:54:16,890
Make that.

2865
02:54:16,950 --> 02:54:17,890
Make that instead.

2866
02:54:18,750 --> 02:54:20,050
Resume cooking.

2867
02:54:22,650 --> 02:54:24,290
What's their relationship at?

2868
02:54:26,070 --> 02:54:26,890
A Bruce.

2869
02:54:28,810 --> 02:54:30,510
That's his name, Bruce.

2870
02:54:31,790 --> 02:54:34,190
For some reason, Chucky does not like the dresser.

2871
02:54:35,870 --> 02:54:36,850
He hates it.

2872
02:54:39,590 --> 02:54:40,310
Alright.

2873
02:54:41,250 --> 02:54:42,650
It worked.

2874
02:54:44,290 --> 02:54:45,870
Did not wash hands.

2875
02:54:46,410 --> 02:54:47,150
That's fine.

2876
02:54:50,350 --> 02:54:53,370
Minto finished making... Oh, toaster pastries.

2877
02:54:53,590 --> 02:54:55,010
A delicious plate.

2878
02:54:55,610 --> 02:54:56,390
Wait, where are they going?

2879
02:54:58,750 --> 02:54:59,630
Is she making another one?

2880
02:55:00,590 --> 02:55:01,070
Or...

2881
02:55:01,070 --> 02:55:03,370
It's in her inven... There's inventory in this game?

2882
02:55:07,880 --> 02:55:08,840
Single pastry.

2883
02:55:11,580 --> 02:55:12,360
Eat that.

2884
02:55:14,820 --> 02:55:16,180
No, no, don't worry about it.

2885
02:55:16,220 --> 02:55:16,640
Just leave it.

2886
02:55:16,700 --> 02:55:17,100
It's fine.

2887
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,140
Eat the... Eat the pastry.

2888
02:55:20,260 --> 02:55:20,760
You're hungry.

2889
02:55:24,560 --> 02:55:25,720
She made another one.

2890
02:55:25,880 --> 02:55:28,160
And now, she's going to eat that one.

2891
02:55:35,080 --> 02:55:36,380
Oh, he's smelling her.

2892
02:55:36,460 --> 02:55:37,780
He's taking her in, you guys.

2893
02:55:38,440 --> 02:55:39,460
He's taking her in.

2894
02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:40,260
He's like, yeah.

2895
02:55:40,740 --> 02:55:42,060
Wait, where did Matara go?

2896
02:55:42,220 --> 02:55:44,560
Oh, she's just peeing in front of that guy.

2897
02:55:48,600 --> 02:55:50,080
And you think she wants a shower?

2898
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:51,940
Or...

2899
02:55:51,940 --> 02:55:53,020
Nah, she's going to sleep.

2900
02:55:58,680 --> 02:56:00,660
She is tired.

2901
02:56:02,880 --> 02:56:03,760
Typical Matara.

2902
02:56:04,060 --> 02:56:05,220
Yeah, real Matara behavior.

2903
02:56:06,760 --> 02:56:08,080
Is he going to the bathroom?

2904
02:56:08,260 --> 02:56:09,000
Right next to her?

2905
02:56:12,080 --> 02:56:13,760
Oh my god, he's about to fight her.

2906
02:56:15,780 --> 02:56:17,680
She's sleeping with her eyes open.

2907
02:56:18,780 --> 02:56:20,380
Greetings to you, my dearie.

2908
02:56:20,800 --> 02:56:22,580
I've heard this town has sims looking for...

2909
02:56:22,580 --> 02:56:23,460
The perfect mate!

2910
02:56:26,640 --> 02:56:27,760
Oh, oh my gosh.

2911
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:29,940
Matara, Matara, Matara, Matara, Matara, Matara.

2912
02:56:29,940 --> 02:56:31,600
Hygiene desperation.

2913
02:56:31,780 --> 02:56:32,280
You're fine.

2914
02:56:32,460 --> 02:56:33,360
Call this lady.

2915
02:56:35,900 --> 02:56:36,420
Call...

2916
02:56:37,400 --> 02:56:38,760
How do I... service?

2917
02:56:40,860 --> 02:56:42,300
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

2918
02:56:42,740 --> 02:56:43,220
No, no, no.

2919
02:56:43,280 --> 02:56:44,040
This is more important.

2920
02:56:49,880 --> 02:56:51,940
It is the...

2921
02:56:55,560 --> 02:56:56,640
Which one is it?

2922
02:56:58,620 --> 02:57:00,880
Why does the house look like FNAF?

2923
02:57:00,980 --> 02:57:01,340
Where?

2924
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:04,240
Obedience trainer?

2925
02:57:06,240 --> 02:57:07,660
Call the maid.

2926
02:57:09,220 --> 02:57:11,600
We'll get an actual maid up in here.

2927
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:16,360
She's hot!

2928
02:57:18,760 --> 02:57:20,760
Call the exterminator.

2929
02:57:20,920 --> 02:57:21,980
Yeah, we need that too.

2930
02:57:24,780 --> 02:57:25,140
Woohoo!

2931
02:57:25,140 --> 02:57:27,980
Wait, how do I find that lady?

2932
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:33,840
We need Matara to... Wait, where did that guy go?

2933
02:57:34,360 --> 02:57:34,720
Bruce!

2934
02:57:35,020 --> 02:57:36,220
Oh, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce.

2935
02:57:37,340 --> 02:57:38,020
Appreciate you.

2936
02:57:38,060 --> 02:57:39,220
We're gonna appreciate you, Bruce.

2937
02:57:41,520 --> 02:57:42,780
We're gonna appreciate you.

2938
02:57:42,860 --> 02:57:43,580
What are you up to?

2939
02:57:45,400 --> 02:57:46,660
She's doing her own thing.

2940
02:57:47,300 --> 02:57:48,100
Oh, it's the lady!

2941
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:48,640
It's the lady!

2942
02:57:50,360 --> 02:57:51,360
Greet the lady.

2943
02:57:58,020 --> 02:57:59,520
Don't care about the mail.

2944
02:57:59,880 --> 02:58:00,520
Unless it's bills.

2945
02:58:00,640 --> 02:58:01,580
I think we gotta pay those.

2946
02:58:02,720 --> 02:58:03,980
He's trying to escape.

2947
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:04,760
No, sir.

2948
02:58:07,400 --> 02:58:09,480
Greet the lady and then pay the bills.

2949
02:58:11,220 --> 02:58:13,100
Is this the lady that... Wait, where are you going?

2950
02:58:13,640 --> 02:58:14,160
Buy a potion.

2951
02:58:14,300 --> 02:58:14,860
Buy a potion.

2952
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:16,480
Buy a love potion.

2953
02:58:16,480 --> 02:58:17,380
Oh my God.

2954
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:19,360
Buy five... Oh, I should have bought ten of them.

2955
02:58:19,500 --> 02:58:19,940
Oh my God!

2956
02:58:20,060 --> 02:58:20,720
Our next victim.

2957
02:58:23,340 --> 02:58:25,360
Ok, we're gonna buy the potions.

2958
02:58:27,040 --> 02:58:29,840
We are going to greet him.

2959
02:58:29,960 --> 02:58:33,260
We're going to use... Why are they wearing the same exact thing?

2960
02:58:33,820 --> 02:58:35,100
I think she has a type.

2961
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:43,180
Oh, I think she's hungry.

2962
02:58:43,480 --> 02:58:45,120
Ok, go eat this Pop-Tart.

2963
02:58:46,480 --> 02:58:47,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2964
02:58:47,140 --> 02:58:47,620
There she goes.

2965
02:58:49,140 --> 02:58:50,520
We'll let her take a shower eventually.

2966
02:58:54,460 --> 02:58:57,400
Can she give more?

2967
02:59:00,200 --> 02:59:00,480
Hello?

2968
02:59:00,720 --> 02:59:01,140
More.

2969
02:59:02,240 --> 02:59:03,380
For some reason it's not letting me.

2970
02:59:04,080 --> 02:59:04,940
Another guy!

2971
02:59:05,580 --> 02:59:06,280
Greet Jason.

2972
02:59:06,800 --> 02:59:07,320
Go, Pop-Tart!

2973
02:59:07,460 --> 02:59:07,620
Go!

2974
02:59:08,440 --> 02:59:09,840
Your needs come later!

2975
02:59:12,500 --> 02:59:13,780
Oh, she's showering?

2976
02:59:16,480 --> 02:59:16,800
Oh.

2977
02:59:21,180 --> 02:59:24,160
He wants to play kicky bag real bad.

2978
02:59:30,020 --> 02:59:33,000
He was really into the kicky bag.

2979
02:59:33,180 --> 02:59:33,660
Hey!

2980
02:59:33,880 --> 02:59:34,400
No!

2981
02:59:34,400 --> 02:59:34,460
No!

2982
02:59:48,900 --> 02:59:50,460
She wants a car?

2983
02:59:51,120 --> 02:59:51,860
Oh my God.

2984
02:59:52,180 --> 02:59:52,600
Asana?

2985
02:59:52,880 --> 02:59:55,680
She has such high aspirations.

2986
02:59:58,140 --> 02:59:59,940
No, she never got to greet the other guy.

2987
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:01,500
She was too busy taking a shower.

2988
03:00:02,900 --> 03:00:04,040
Oh, you want to go to sleep?

2989
03:00:04,180 --> 03:00:04,960
Ok, go to sleep.

2990
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:07,720
Go sleep.

2991
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:08,700
In your underwear.

2992
03:00:10,480 --> 03:00:11,740
It's only 6pm.

2993
03:00:12,220 --> 03:00:13,540
I'm going to sell this game.

2994
03:00:13,680 --> 03:00:14,740
I hate it so much.

2995
03:00:15,580 --> 03:00:16,880
It's so stupid.

2996
03:00:23,340 --> 03:00:24,440
Did they all leave?

2997
03:00:24,640 --> 03:00:26,180
Nope, he's playing Axe game.

2998
03:00:34,320 --> 03:00:35,280
It's funny though.

2999
03:00:35,320 --> 03:00:36,100
Please keep it.

3000
03:00:36,160 --> 03:00:37,420
Ok, look at her go.

3001
03:00:40,360 --> 03:00:41,320
Oh nice!

3002
03:00:43,080 --> 03:00:44,660
She wants a table.

3003
03:00:45,660 --> 03:00:46,140
Understandable.

3004
03:00:51,880 --> 03:00:53,840
I'm going to have her...

3005
03:00:54,860 --> 03:00:56,540
Let's go to Matara's side.

3006
03:00:56,980 --> 03:00:58,880
That guy didn't even clean up the dish.

3007
03:00:58,960 --> 03:00:59,900
This guy sucks.

3008
03:00:59,900 --> 03:01:02,920
Serve dinner, mac and cheese.

3009
03:01:04,440 --> 03:01:05,260
Come on Minto.

3010
03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:09,220
Mata needs to eat.

3011
03:01:09,880 --> 03:01:11,240
She'll eat eventually.

3012
03:01:18,080 --> 03:01:19,420
Who's this guy?

3013
03:01:21,100 --> 03:01:21,880
Lazlo!

3014
03:01:22,200 --> 03:01:23,920
He's the Empreg man!

3015
03:01:24,780 --> 03:01:27,260
Wait, she's... Greet him!

3016
03:01:27,560 --> 03:01:28,440
Greet him!

3017
03:01:29,600 --> 03:01:30,200
Nevermind.

3018
03:01:30,920 --> 03:01:32,040
The Empreg!

3019
03:01:33,740 --> 03:01:36,380
Yes, there was a guy with the Empreg, you guys.

3020
03:01:36,840 --> 03:01:38,120
The Empreg guy.

3021
03:01:40,440 --> 03:01:41,740
You like that sound?

3022
03:01:50,200 --> 03:01:52,980
So they are on a strict mac and cheese diet.

3023
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:55,060
As the cheesy family.

3024
03:01:57,500 --> 03:01:58,780
Mac and cheese.

3025
03:02:00,440 --> 03:02:02,260
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, baby.

3026
03:02:04,840 --> 03:02:07,580
Always some good old mac and cheese.

3027
03:02:11,760 --> 03:02:12,360
Nice.

3028
03:02:14,400 --> 03:02:15,760
Look at her cooking that.

3029
03:02:16,060 --> 03:02:17,300
She's adding those spices.

3030
03:02:18,620 --> 03:02:19,620
She's doing a good job.

3031
03:02:20,360 --> 03:02:21,420
Sounds unhealthy?

3032
03:02:22,440 --> 03:02:23,040
No.

3033
03:02:23,980 --> 03:02:25,140
It's probably fine.

3034
03:02:25,460 --> 03:02:27,600
And we're going to have a maid soon, so it doesn't matter.

3035
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:31,760
Alright Matara, your energy is up enough.

3036
03:02:31,860 --> 03:02:34,220
You gotta go grab a bowl.

3037
03:02:34,220 --> 03:02:35,240
Come on.

3038
03:02:36,040 --> 03:02:38,400
And then you're going to flirt with that guy again.

3039
03:02:39,300 --> 03:02:42,540
Bruce, the guy who's really overstaying his welcome.

3040
03:02:46,820 --> 03:02:49,700
You guys, in this world, I guess I'm not a maid.

3041
03:02:50,020 --> 03:02:53,740
It's just kind of how it is, I think.

3042
03:02:57,060 --> 03:03:00,280
Alright, go appreciate him.

3043
03:03:00,400 --> 03:03:03,020
We're going to get your social up with him.

3044
03:03:05,040 --> 03:03:06,000
Barely know him.

3045
03:03:06,040 --> 03:03:09,220
We're going to make it so that you are...

3046
03:03:11,080 --> 03:03:11,960
Give gift.

3047
03:03:12,260 --> 03:03:13,660
Ok, here we go.

3048
03:03:14,960 --> 03:03:16,160
Ew, this guy stinks.

3049
03:03:16,340 --> 03:03:17,320
Get out of my house.

3050
03:03:19,020 --> 03:03:22,300
Ok, now we're going to give him this.

3051
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:24,860
Here you go.

3052
03:03:25,700 --> 03:03:26,580
Here you go Bruce.

3053
03:03:27,500 --> 03:03:28,560
Here you go Bruce.

3054
03:03:34,460 --> 03:03:36,760
You're supposed to open it and like...

3055
03:03:36,760 --> 03:03:38,160
We're going to charm him.

3056
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:39,040
We're going to charm this guy.

3057
03:03:40,280 --> 03:03:41,360
See, he likes her!

3058
03:03:41,700 --> 03:03:42,800
He likes her!

3059
03:03:42,980 --> 03:03:45,500
Ok, now you can go to the bed.

3060
03:03:47,820 --> 03:03:48,620
Come here Bruce.

3061
03:03:49,500 --> 03:03:49,880
Bruce?

3062
03:03:51,600 --> 03:03:52,380
You want a hug?

3063
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:53,780
You want a hug Bruce?

3064
03:03:55,740 --> 03:03:56,820
Oh my god.

3065
03:03:56,980 --> 03:03:57,460
Oh my god.

3066
03:03:57,560 --> 03:03:58,200
We're speed running.

3067
03:03:58,360 --> 03:03:58,900
We're speed running.

3068
03:03:59,040 --> 03:03:59,520
We're speed running.

3069
03:03:59,700 --> 03:04:01,260
We're going to give him a back rub.

3070
03:04:04,720 --> 03:04:06,160
Keep running.

3071
03:04:07,180 --> 03:04:08,780
Oh my god.

3072
03:04:09,580 --> 03:04:10,880
Woohoo in the coffin bed?

3073
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:11,740
Yes!

3074
03:04:12,360 --> 03:04:12,720
Yes!

3075
03:04:12,820 --> 03:04:13,500
Yes!

3076
03:04:14,040 --> 03:04:14,600
Yes!

3077
03:04:17,020 --> 03:04:18,760
Matara, you must become pregnant.

3078
03:04:19,040 --> 03:04:21,580
It's for this.

3079
03:04:21,900 --> 03:04:22,840
What's a suggestion?

3080
03:04:23,360 --> 03:04:24,000
What does that mean?

3081
03:04:25,340 --> 03:04:26,840
Does she not like him?

3082
03:04:27,440 --> 03:04:28,540
Who's calling?

3083
03:04:29,420 --> 03:04:30,820
At 10pm?

3084
03:04:32,800 --> 03:04:33,560
Answer?

3085
03:04:39,860 --> 03:04:41,120
Smelly man.

3086
03:04:41,900 --> 03:04:43,820
I thought she liked the boy's smell.

3087
03:04:47,240 --> 03:04:48,160
What's she doing?

3088
03:04:48,460 --> 03:04:49,160
He pounced?

3089
03:04:49,560 --> 03:04:50,860
He's so cute.

3090
03:04:51,600 --> 03:04:52,120
Hey Matara.

3091
03:05:00,140 --> 03:05:00,900
Yes?

3092
03:05:00,900 --> 03:05:01,740
Yes?

3093
03:05:05,020 --> 03:05:06,460
Matara, go have some more food.

3094
03:05:08,080 --> 03:05:09,920
She's right behind you!

3095
03:05:13,100 --> 03:05:14,160
No way!

3096
03:05:14,880 --> 03:05:15,640
Wait, Minto.

3097
03:05:15,920 --> 03:05:16,640
What are you doing?

3098
03:05:17,480 --> 03:05:18,000
Say goodbye.

3099
03:05:18,180 --> 03:05:19,320
Ok, that's fine.

3100
03:05:19,640 --> 03:05:20,180
Answer?

3101
03:05:20,660 --> 03:05:21,660
Answer the phone.

3102
03:05:22,240 --> 03:05:22,800
See you later.

3103
03:05:23,040 --> 03:05:25,040
Yeah, go home and shower stinky.

3104
03:05:26,360 --> 03:05:26,920
God.

3105
03:05:36,140 --> 03:05:38,480
This is working out pretty well guys.

3106
03:05:39,180 --> 03:05:42,640
This is working out pretty well I'd say.

3107
03:05:45,880 --> 03:05:46,440
No!

3108
03:05:46,940 --> 03:05:47,220
No!

3109
03:05:47,600 --> 03:05:48,840
I think you should go to the bathroom.

3110
03:05:49,740 --> 03:05:51,320
And then go back to sleep.

3111
03:05:55,400 --> 03:05:57,100
Oh wait, we lost something.

3112
03:05:57,520 --> 03:05:58,100
Wait, what happened?

3113
03:05:59,780 --> 03:06:01,160
What just happened?

3114
03:06:01,400 --> 03:06:02,360
Oh, they are asleep.

3115
03:06:02,500 --> 03:06:02,620
Ok.

3116
03:06:04,580 --> 03:06:06,560
This guy is really overstaying his welcome.

3117
03:06:06,800 --> 03:06:09,260
He just wanders around the whole house.

3118
03:06:11,300 --> 03:06:11,820
Alright.

3119
03:06:12,700 --> 03:06:13,060
Ok.

3120
03:06:13,760 --> 03:06:19,620
Well, we got a little further with this guy.

3121
03:06:19,760 --> 03:06:21,440
What do the things mean I wonder?

3122
03:06:21,600 --> 03:06:22,560
He's a friend.

3123
03:06:25,060 --> 03:06:26,220
He's a friend.

3124
03:06:27,440 --> 03:06:28,860
No Minto, stop.

3125
03:06:29,420 --> 03:06:30,400
You don't have to do that.

3126
03:06:30,480 --> 03:06:31,400
We hired a maid.

3127
03:06:41,750 --> 03:06:43,370
There's plenty of environment.

3128
03:06:43,730 --> 03:06:44,770
They are fine.

3129
03:06:45,250 --> 03:06:46,350
They are so fine.

3130
03:06:46,590 --> 03:06:47,630
Everything is cool.

3131
03:06:48,890 --> 03:06:49,910
She's cleaning that.

3132
03:06:49,990 --> 03:06:51,210
No, you don't have to do that.

3133
03:06:51,270 --> 03:06:52,530
That's not your job here.

3134
03:06:54,030 --> 03:07:00,830
You're gonna make many group meals of mac and cheese.

3135
03:07:04,150 --> 03:07:04,550
Ok.

3136
03:07:08,790 --> 03:07:13,150
She's gotta go to both houses to make this happen.

3137
03:07:13,290 --> 03:07:14,370
To make this work, you know.

3138
03:07:15,830 --> 03:07:17,990
Wow, not Matara actually cleaning and helping.

3139
03:07:18,550 --> 03:07:21,410
Oh my god, Minto is gaining all the culinary...

3140
03:07:23,130 --> 03:07:25,050
All the culinary experience.

3141
03:07:26,010 --> 03:07:27,490
Ok, I think you can eat it now.

3142
03:07:27,550 --> 03:07:28,330
Is it in your inventory?

3143
03:07:28,530 --> 03:07:31,710
Oh my gosh, we have 5 bowls of mac and cheese!

3144
03:07:32,550 --> 03:07:35,010
Wait, we have so much mac and cheese.

3145
03:07:37,610 --> 03:07:38,810
When did this happen?

3146
03:07:40,430 --> 03:07:42,630
Wait, why do we want to scold Chucky?

3147
03:07:43,010 --> 03:07:44,430
Why is she such a freak?

3148
03:07:45,570 --> 03:07:47,070
Buy a scratching post.

3149
03:07:47,210 --> 03:07:48,190
Oh, that's a great idea.

3150
03:07:49,250 --> 03:07:51,250
That's an actual really good idea.

3151
03:07:52,730 --> 03:07:53,810
Scratching post.

3152
03:07:56,990 --> 03:07:58,370
Oh yeah, and a sculpture.

3153
03:07:58,630 --> 03:07:59,530
Let's buy a sculpture.

3154
03:08:01,710 --> 03:08:03,630
Where would a sculpture be?

3155
03:08:03,850 --> 03:08:04,270
Under here?

3156
03:08:04,810 --> 03:08:07,710
Yeah, it's gotta be worth a lot of money.

3157
03:08:10,610 --> 03:08:11,090
Lawhenge?

3158
03:08:12,210 --> 03:08:13,390
That's so cute.

3159
03:08:15,630 --> 03:08:16,790
I like that one.

3160
03:08:18,130 --> 03:08:19,150
How about a table?

3161
03:08:19,290 --> 03:08:20,530
Yeah, we do need to buy a table.

3162
03:08:21,130 --> 03:08:21,990
What's this?

3163
03:08:25,830 --> 03:08:27,410
I don't think we have room.

3164
03:08:29,990 --> 03:08:31,690
What the hell?

3165
03:08:33,650 --> 03:08:34,890
Diver man.

3166
03:08:35,150 --> 03:08:36,930
Okay, I like that.

3167
03:08:38,090 --> 03:08:40,670
Have they even gone upstairs even once?

3168
03:08:40,990 --> 03:08:42,710
Wait, what can I put upstairs?

3169
03:08:49,080 --> 03:08:50,020
Here we go.

3170
03:08:56,130 --> 03:08:58,170
Alright, where's our maid?

3171
03:08:58,530 --> 03:08:59,430
It's 10 AM.

3172
03:09:01,050 --> 03:09:02,390
Buy curtains.

3173
03:09:02,670 --> 03:09:03,290
We don't need those.

3174
03:09:03,290 --> 03:09:04,410
There she goes.

3175
03:09:05,210 --> 03:09:06,350
There she goes.

3176
03:09:08,350 --> 03:09:10,170
Oh my god, it's huge!

3177
03:09:11,070 --> 03:09:13,570
Look how small she is next to it.

3178
03:09:16,230 --> 03:09:18,990
Minto is really enjoying making mac and cheese, I think.

3179
03:09:21,670 --> 03:09:22,870
There's our maid!

3180
03:09:23,570 --> 03:09:25,770
Her name is...

3181
03:09:25,770 --> 03:09:29,650
Her name...

3182
03:09:30,650 --> 03:09:33,830
...is Aliana.

3183
03:09:35,990 --> 03:09:36,790
Aliana!

3184
03:09:42,490 --> 03:09:44,610
She's cleaning for us.

3185
03:09:45,310 --> 03:09:46,230
Oh my gosh.

3186
03:09:46,890 --> 03:09:48,110
She's great at that.

3187
03:09:48,590 --> 03:09:50,910
It's like it's her job or something.

3188
03:09:52,930 --> 03:09:55,630
Is our diver clipping through the roof?

3189
03:09:55,690 --> 03:09:56,370
We can check.

3190
03:10:07,970 --> 03:10:08,650
Um...

3191
03:10:09,930 --> 03:10:13,170
He might be...

3192
03:10:17,090 --> 03:10:21,290
He might be... I actually kind of want to switch it...

3193
03:10:21,290 --> 03:10:23,930
No, we never had the roof on.

3194
03:10:23,970 --> 03:10:24,410
It's fine.

3195
03:10:27,590 --> 03:10:28,270
Gosh.

3196
03:10:29,750 --> 03:10:31,070
You think he's got a wedgie?

3197
03:10:32,610 --> 03:10:33,290
Wow.

3198
03:10:33,290 --> 03:10:33,430
Wow.

3199
03:10:39,070 --> 03:10:40,750
My cat.

3200
03:10:42,490 --> 03:10:44,170
Through the roof.

3201
03:10:44,290 --> 03:10:45,490
Damn, she's so hot.

3202
03:10:47,150 --> 03:10:49,970
I'm gonna... Can I flirt with her?

3203
03:10:50,730 --> 03:10:52,690
Influence to bathe.

3204
03:10:55,010 --> 03:10:56,690
Where is the maid?

3205
03:10:59,130 --> 03:11:01,130
I think Matara's got it.

3206
03:11:01,130 --> 03:11:01,970
Hello?

3207
03:11:04,430 --> 03:11:05,650
Who is this?

3208
03:11:07,950 --> 03:11:09,950
I'm so popular!

3209
03:11:12,910 --> 03:11:14,450
Ask a Sim on a date.

3210
03:11:14,670 --> 03:11:16,670
Alright guys, that's our goal for today.

3211
03:11:17,870 --> 03:11:21,370
The goal is to ask a Sim on a date.

3212
03:11:21,930 --> 03:11:26,010
Ok Minto, you are literally obsessed with preparing mac and cheese.

3213
03:11:26,490 --> 03:11:28,610
I can't have you live like this anymore.

3214
03:11:28,610 --> 03:11:30,310
You haven't even eaten.

3215
03:11:33,370 --> 03:11:34,850
I'm so popular.

3216
03:11:35,770 --> 03:11:36,890
Oh my gosh.

3217
03:11:38,790 --> 03:11:39,490
You have been selected.

3218
03:11:39,630 --> 03:11:41,250
Oh, a new magazine.

3219
03:11:42,430 --> 03:11:42,810
What?

3220
03:11:53,810 --> 03:11:56,250
I thought it was a friend.

3221
03:11:58,230 --> 03:12:00,190
I thought it was a friend.

3222
03:12:01,850 --> 03:12:04,290
We have 8 things of mac and cheese.

3223
03:12:04,990 --> 03:12:07,330
Please Minto, you have to eat now.

3224
03:12:07,570 --> 03:12:08,730
You've done your job.

3225
03:12:09,730 --> 03:12:11,030
Please, serve.

3226
03:12:12,330 --> 03:12:13,350
She's serving.

3227
03:12:16,790 --> 03:12:18,490
There's 2 things of mac and cheese.

3228
03:12:18,830 --> 03:12:21,170
Put the leftovers away.

3229
03:12:23,610 --> 03:12:24,970
Eat up, eat up.

3230
03:12:25,590 --> 03:12:26,670
The cheesy family.

3231
03:12:26,830 --> 03:12:27,310
All set.

3232
03:12:27,450 --> 03:12:28,470
Wow, she really got it.

3233
03:12:28,470 --> 03:12:29,410
Did she just fart?

3234
03:12:30,630 --> 03:12:32,790
No, I think I saw wrong.

3235
03:12:35,370 --> 03:12:37,530
I think I did not see that correctly.

3236
03:12:44,830 --> 03:12:47,390
We're gonna have Atara get off this.

3237
03:12:48,150 --> 03:12:51,190
And we're gonna have her call...

3238
03:12:51,910 --> 03:12:53,830
Wait, she can ask him on a date.

3239
03:12:55,170 --> 03:12:56,150
Ask Bruce.

3240
03:12:58,090 --> 03:12:58,690
What?

3241
03:12:58,730 --> 03:12:59,750
His answering machine.

3242
03:13:00,990 --> 03:13:02,970
Bruce sucks.

3243
03:13:03,710 --> 03:13:05,710
Let's try again.

3244
03:13:07,130 --> 03:13:07,930
Call.

3245
03:13:08,930 --> 03:13:10,170
Ask on a date.

3246
03:13:11,310 --> 03:13:12,390
Bruce.

3247
03:13:14,650 --> 03:13:17,210
Community lot or your place.

3248
03:13:18,190 --> 03:13:21,470
Let's go to our home.

3249
03:13:23,070 --> 03:13:25,150
Oh my god, it's a date.

3250
03:13:25,790 --> 03:13:27,990
Hug romantically.

3251
03:13:27,990 --> 03:13:29,870
Get off the drums, Matara Khan.

3252
03:13:29,910 --> 03:13:30,710
Your date is here.

3253
03:13:35,090 --> 03:13:35,810
It's working.

3254
03:13:36,250 --> 03:13:37,130
She asked the date.

3255
03:13:37,350 --> 03:13:38,250
Oh my gosh, we have so many things.

3256
03:13:38,330 --> 03:13:38,890
Tell a joke.

3257
03:13:44,250 --> 03:13:45,830
Oh my god.

3258
03:13:47,190 --> 03:13:47,990
She's gonna joke.

3259
03:13:48,170 --> 03:13:48,770
OK, entertain.

3260
03:13:49,330 --> 03:13:50,710
She's gonna entertain him.

3261
03:13:52,450 --> 03:13:53,130
What?

3262
03:13:55,410 --> 03:13:56,310
She can kiss!

3263
03:13:56,490 --> 03:13:57,570
She can kiss!

3264
03:13:57,850 --> 03:13:58,590
Oh my god.

3265
03:13:59,530 --> 03:14:01,830
She's entertaining and telling a joke.

3266
03:14:02,610 --> 03:14:03,370
It worked.

3267
03:14:03,770 --> 03:14:04,610
It worked, right?

3268
03:14:05,670 --> 03:14:06,910
It worked!

3269
03:14:07,130 --> 03:14:07,710
It worked.

3270
03:14:08,170 --> 03:14:11,710
Oh my gosh, she wants to play...

3271
03:14:15,010 --> 03:14:15,690
Tickle.

3272
03:14:15,690 --> 03:14:20,690
I don't think he likes whatever she...

3273
03:14:22,190 --> 03:14:23,970
She wants to flirt with Bruce.

3274
03:14:24,570 --> 03:14:25,470
We're getting all of this.

3275
03:14:25,650 --> 03:14:27,210
We're gonna...

3276
03:14:28,190 --> 03:14:28,970
Hit on him?

3277
03:14:29,030 --> 03:14:29,470
I don't know.

3278
03:14:29,770 --> 03:14:30,350
What does that mean?

3279
03:14:32,950 --> 03:14:34,890
She wants to dine out with Bruce.

3280
03:14:35,090 --> 03:14:36,230
She wants to give a back rub.

3281
03:14:39,470 --> 03:14:39,910
Propose.

3282
03:14:40,850 --> 03:14:41,530
Stay the night.

3283
03:14:59,590 --> 03:15:02,070
They're doing... Oh wait, they stop the kiss.

3284
03:15:02,190 --> 03:15:04,010
No, kiss is part of your wants.

3285
03:15:04,150 --> 03:15:04,890
What are you...

3286
03:15:08,550 --> 03:15:10,010
Can I invite him to the bed?

3287
03:15:10,110 --> 03:15:10,470
Come on.

3288
03:15:10,610 --> 03:15:11,490
Walk to...

3289
03:15:11,490 --> 03:15:12,110
No, no, no.

3290
03:15:12,590 --> 03:15:13,270
Jump rope.

3291
03:15:13,370 --> 03:15:13,710
What the hell?

3292
03:15:15,210 --> 03:15:16,530
How do I get him in bed?

3293
03:15:16,530 --> 03:15:18,170
How do you do this more?

3294
03:15:20,370 --> 03:15:20,970
Ask.

3295
03:15:23,970 --> 03:15:25,530
What turns you on?

3296
03:15:25,750 --> 03:15:26,310
Oh my gosh.

3297
03:15:27,950 --> 03:15:29,430
Cuddle under the clouds?

3298
03:15:29,690 --> 03:15:30,350
What is this?

3299
03:15:33,890 --> 03:15:37,190
Influence to flirt with?

3300
03:15:37,730 --> 03:15:38,750
What does that mean?

3301
03:15:40,730 --> 03:15:42,930
The date is almost a great you guys.

3302
03:15:42,930 --> 03:15:45,250
No, don't influence to flirt with Minto.

3303
03:15:46,290 --> 03:15:46,770
Nevermind.

3304
03:15:47,390 --> 03:15:48,590
Flirt, hold hands.

3305
03:15:48,770 --> 03:15:49,470
Do that.

3306
03:15:51,870 --> 03:15:53,190
She's gonna give a back rub.

3307
03:15:53,350 --> 03:15:54,990
The cat is going crazy right now.

3308
03:16:01,170 --> 03:16:01,650
God!

3309
03:16:01,830 --> 03:16:02,990
Minto is in the bed!

3310
03:16:03,930 --> 03:16:06,010
Minto, go to your own bed girl.

3311
03:16:06,470 --> 03:16:07,030
What are you doing?

3312
03:16:08,770 --> 03:16:09,650
Go here.

3313
03:16:13,510 --> 03:16:15,630
Minto, go sleep here.

3314
03:16:15,750 --> 03:16:16,790
Go sleep here.

3315
03:16:20,010 --> 03:16:21,210
Don't irritate.

3316
03:16:22,030 --> 03:16:22,570
Propose.

3317
03:16:22,870 --> 03:16:24,570
Is it to propose to stay the night?

3318
03:16:25,790 --> 03:16:26,770
Romantic hug.

3319
03:16:26,910 --> 03:16:27,670
Romantic hug.

3320
03:16:28,750 --> 03:16:30,870
Ok, she wants to kiss him.

3321
03:16:31,050 --> 03:16:31,610
I'm trying.

3322
03:16:31,810 --> 03:16:32,490
I'm trying.

3323
03:16:32,990 --> 03:16:33,910
Up the arm.

3324
03:16:35,530 --> 03:16:36,270
Wait, where is she going?

3325
03:16:38,770 --> 03:16:40,690
Wow, she's really flirting good.

3326
03:16:40,990 --> 03:16:41,910
Make out!

3327
03:16:42,190 --> 03:16:43,030
Ok, ok, ok.

3328
03:16:43,090 --> 03:16:44,430
You guys, make out.

3329
03:16:45,170 --> 03:16:46,070
Suck face.

3330
03:16:48,310 --> 03:16:49,490
You think that will work?

3331
03:16:52,310 --> 03:16:53,270
Stop complaining.

3332
03:16:53,510 --> 03:16:54,630
What are you so upset about?

3333
03:16:58,990 --> 03:17:00,030
Why is she so upset?

3334
03:17:02,130 --> 03:17:04,290
Oh, he's gonna give her a back rub now.

3335
03:17:04,770 --> 03:17:05,230
Stop.

3336
03:17:05,890 --> 03:17:06,930
Suck his face.

3337
03:17:07,090 --> 03:17:07,430
Please.

3338
03:17:10,350 --> 03:17:10,810
Please.

3339
03:17:12,170 --> 03:17:13,090
She's about to eat him.

3340
03:17:13,190 --> 03:17:14,490
I know I want it to happen.

3341
03:17:16,810 --> 03:17:21,130
Oh, what just happened?

3342
03:17:23,470 --> 03:17:26,490
Ok, proposed to stay the night.

3343
03:17:28,730 --> 03:17:30,570
Wait, did that not count as a kiss?

3344
03:17:30,690 --> 03:17:32,110
Oh, he's gotta make out.

3345
03:17:32,210 --> 03:17:32,510
That's right.

3346
03:17:34,030 --> 03:17:34,430
Dance?

3347
03:17:34,850 --> 03:17:35,630
How is that kissing?

3348
03:17:39,550 --> 03:17:40,910
Oh, I think he likes her.

3349
03:17:41,210 --> 03:17:43,070
Guys, I think he likes her.

3350
03:17:43,210 --> 03:17:44,070
Is he staying the night?

3351
03:17:47,810 --> 03:17:50,510
Wait, if I relax...

3352
03:17:51,510 --> 03:17:51,910
Oh!

3353
03:17:52,130 --> 03:17:53,010
Wait, what did I do?

3354
03:17:53,790 --> 03:17:54,910
I don't know what I just did.

3355
03:17:57,150 --> 03:17:58,370
Give a back rub.

3356
03:18:01,210 --> 03:18:02,350
Good job, Chucky.

3357
03:18:05,630 --> 03:18:06,230
I don't know.

3358
03:18:06,290 --> 03:18:08,110
Oh, I think she's upset about this.

3359
03:18:08,190 --> 03:18:08,390
Ok.

3360
03:18:12,830 --> 03:18:13,530
She's happy.

3361
03:18:13,690 --> 03:18:14,230
Everything is good.

3362
03:18:14,310 --> 03:18:15,010
Everything is great.

3363
03:18:15,150 --> 03:18:15,790
Everything is perfect.

3364
03:18:16,270 --> 03:18:17,270
She's mopping it up.

3365
03:18:17,870 --> 03:18:18,670
Wait, what's happening?

3366
03:18:19,410 --> 03:18:20,210
Oh, he's peeing.

3367
03:18:20,350 --> 03:18:20,930
Ok, nevermind.

3368
03:18:23,490 --> 03:18:24,430
Matara, wake up.

3369
03:18:24,670 --> 03:18:25,070
Matara.

3370
03:18:25,290 --> 03:18:25,750
Matara.

3371
03:18:25,970 --> 03:18:26,810
Matara, wake up.

3372
03:18:26,930 --> 03:18:27,810
Matara, wake up.

3373
03:18:28,010 --> 03:18:29,730
Wait, unless he sleeps there too.

3374
03:18:31,530 --> 03:18:33,170
Maybe relax in the bed.

3375
03:18:36,050 --> 03:18:37,870
What is he doing with it?

3376
03:18:37,930 --> 03:18:38,570
What is this?

3377
03:18:39,430 --> 03:18:42,690
He's got like a little Rubik's Cube that he plays with.

3378
03:18:48,210 --> 03:18:48,690
Invite?

3379
03:18:51,350 --> 03:18:53,430
I don't know how to do this.

3380
03:18:55,150 --> 03:18:55,870
More.

3381
03:19:00,630 --> 03:19:02,250
Influence to bathe.

3382
03:19:03,650 --> 03:19:04,370
No!

3383
03:19:04,990 --> 03:19:05,410
No!

3384
03:19:05,830 --> 03:19:07,230
Bruce, please!

3385
03:19:08,290 --> 03:19:08,770
No!

3386
03:19:08,930 --> 03:19:11,090
Everyone is obsessed with this stupid thing.

3387
03:19:12,590 --> 03:19:16,230
Wait, she needs to have a dream date.

3388
03:19:16,750 --> 03:19:17,330
Hug Bruce.

3389
03:19:17,730 --> 03:19:18,670
She needs to hug him.

3390
03:19:19,490 --> 03:19:21,110
Leap into his arms.

3391
03:19:22,730 --> 03:19:24,410
Come on, leap into his arms.

3392
03:19:24,690 --> 03:19:25,950
Ok, she's happy again.

3393
03:19:26,030 --> 03:19:26,670
She's happy again.

3394
03:19:27,050 --> 03:19:27,690
Everything is good.

3395
03:19:28,110 --> 03:19:28,830
What just happened?

3396
03:19:30,670 --> 03:19:31,830
What the hell was that?

3397
03:19:32,410 --> 03:19:35,770
She needs to... she really likes back rubs.

3398
03:19:37,590 --> 03:19:40,410
She really likes the back rubs guys.

3399
03:19:43,530 --> 03:19:45,330
She needs to flirt with Bruce.

3400
03:19:45,810 --> 03:19:47,570
What is their relationship bad anyway?

3401
03:19:48,670 --> 03:19:50,250
She has a crush on him.

3402
03:19:51,030 --> 03:19:53,230
Ok, that's fine.

3403
03:19:53,930 --> 03:19:54,750
Caress him.

3404
03:19:57,410 --> 03:19:59,470
If I saw that thing IRL I would hop on it.

3405
03:19:59,550 --> 03:20:00,350
I think I would too.

3406
03:20:01,990 --> 03:20:03,530
We are almost to a dream date.

3407
03:20:03,630 --> 03:20:04,490
Wait, what just happened?

3408
03:20:04,950 --> 03:20:05,430
Why is he upset?

3409
03:20:06,550 --> 03:20:07,590
Wait, what just happened?

3410
03:20:08,430 --> 03:20:08,990
Charm him.

3411
03:20:09,210 --> 03:20:09,850
Wait, what?

3412
03:20:10,490 --> 03:20:11,210
Was it bad?

3413
03:20:11,990 --> 03:20:13,150
Was the kiss not good?

3414
03:20:14,730 --> 03:20:15,430
Smooch him?

3415
03:20:16,690 --> 03:20:17,310
Smooch him?

3416
03:20:17,810 --> 03:20:17,970
What?

3417
03:20:22,250 --> 03:20:24,370
Oh no, we only have a minute left you guys!

3418
03:20:27,590 --> 03:20:28,570
Hug him.

3419
03:20:29,030 --> 03:20:29,790
Not friendly.

3420
03:20:29,990 --> 03:20:30,590
Well, it works.

3421
03:20:31,070 --> 03:20:32,450
It's almost a dream date!

3422
03:20:32,870 --> 03:20:34,030
It's almost a dream date!

3423
03:20:34,170 --> 03:20:35,570
Kiss, kiss, kiss him!

3424
03:20:37,090 --> 03:20:38,470
We got the dream date!

3425
03:20:40,010 --> 03:20:41,830
Kiara, thanks for the raid!

3426
03:20:43,550 --> 03:20:49,110
I'm trying to get Vitara to have a baby with this guy she just met.

3427
03:20:49,930 --> 03:20:50,450
Wait...

3428
03:20:50,450 --> 03:20:51,530
Oh she's going to sleep.

3429
03:20:51,670 --> 03:20:52,290
No, no, no, no!

3430
03:20:52,510 --> 03:20:53,170
No, stop!

3431
03:20:53,750 --> 03:20:54,150
No!

3432
03:20:58,280 --> 03:21:00,140
I was wondering what that noise was.

3433
03:21:00,300 --> 03:21:02,180
Oh, she's watching nothing.

3434
03:21:04,980 --> 03:21:05,500
Kiara!

3435
03:21:06,240 --> 03:21:07,860
How do you make The Sims?

3436
03:21:08,320 --> 03:21:08,700
Woohoo!

3437
03:21:11,180 --> 03:21:12,800
How do you make The Sims?

3438
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:15,540
I urgently have to eat, sleep, have fun.

3439
03:21:15,640 --> 03:21:16,460
Thank you!

3440
03:21:18,040 --> 03:21:19,600
Have a good meal!

3441
03:21:21,680 --> 03:21:23,560
Hello, KFP.

3442
03:21:24,220 --> 03:21:25,640
This is Bruce.

3443
03:21:25,900 --> 03:21:26,980
We just met him.

3444
03:21:27,300 --> 03:21:29,020
This is Chucky Cheesy, our cat.

3445
03:21:29,540 --> 03:21:30,900
This is Minto Cheesy.

3446
03:21:31,880 --> 03:21:33,200
No relation to me.

3447
03:21:33,440 --> 03:21:35,160
Oh my god, she's eating the bad food.

3448
03:21:35,620 --> 03:21:37,080
I think Minto is going to die.

3449
03:21:38,280 --> 03:21:39,500
We have Tiffany.

3450
03:21:41,220 --> 03:21:42,380
Oh, and then this is Mitara.

3451
03:21:43,360 --> 03:21:47,540
If you don't know Mitara-Kan, she's my friend.

3452
03:21:47,540 --> 03:21:51,480
I'm trying to make her have the 100 baby pregnant challenge.

3453
03:21:51,760 --> 03:21:53,780
And she also sleeps with her eyes open.

3454
03:21:55,480 --> 03:21:56,360
Like that.

3455
03:22:00,600 --> 03:22:01,980
Never changed Minto.

3456
03:22:02,440 --> 03:22:03,260
What did I do?

3457
03:22:03,520 --> 03:22:04,020
What am I doing?

3458
03:22:08,480 --> 03:22:11,960
You relax in the bed, click the other sim and click ask to join.

3459
03:22:13,360 --> 03:22:14,980
You're a great date, baby!

3460
03:22:15,540 --> 03:22:16,280
Wait, come back!

3461
03:22:16,800 --> 03:22:17,320
Come back!

3462
03:22:17,320 --> 03:22:19,420
Come back, Bruce!

3463
03:22:20,220 --> 03:22:20,820
Did he leave?

3464
03:22:26,340 --> 03:22:27,880
I think he left.

3465
03:22:31,540 --> 03:22:33,180
I think he left.

3466
03:22:36,920 --> 03:22:37,640
Why

3467
03:22:41,880 --> 03:22:43,060
is she upset?

3468
03:22:43,200 --> 03:22:43,960
Why is she screaming?

3469
03:22:46,780 --> 03:22:48,260
Thank you guys!

3470
03:22:48,440 --> 03:22:50,200
Sorry, I'm like so invested in this.

3471
03:22:50,560 --> 03:22:55,480
I can't stop like... just everything, you know?

3472
03:22:55,720 --> 03:22:58,220
I wanted that to happen so bad!

3473
03:23:00,220 --> 03:23:01,320
Progress is progress.

3474
03:23:02,200 --> 03:23:05,360
I did say we would try to get Mitara on a date today and we did.

3475
03:23:05,680 --> 03:23:06,580
We did get a date.

3476
03:23:08,760 --> 03:23:11,200
I just want her to have one baby.

3477
03:23:11,700 --> 03:23:12,440
Or get pregnant.

3478
03:23:13,040 --> 03:23:14,940
Get pregnant, Mitara-Khan.

3479
03:23:15,380 --> 03:23:16,480
In the sims.

3480
03:23:17,400 --> 03:23:22,500
What if she called the guy again?

3481
03:23:22,600 --> 03:23:23,960
What if she called him, you know?

3482
03:23:27,880 --> 03:23:29,760
I'm trying... I'm working on it!

3483
03:23:29,880 --> 03:23:32,480
Oh, Mitara's got it.

3484
03:23:32,560 --> 03:23:32,700
See?

3485
03:23:32,840 --> 03:23:33,500
It's all good.

3486
03:23:36,840 --> 03:23:37,840
Everything's fine.

3487
03:23:37,840 --> 03:23:41,280
Okay, we're gonna go until morning.

3488
03:23:44,800 --> 03:23:48,020
And then in the morning, she's gonna call...

3489
03:23:50,740 --> 03:23:52,620
What did she just do?

3490
03:23:52,800 --> 03:23:54,680
Did she just eat something out of the trash?

3491
03:23:54,960 --> 03:23:55,400
Salvage?

3492
03:23:55,520 --> 03:23:56,320
What are you salvaging?

3493
03:23:56,520 --> 03:23:56,900
Wait a second.

3494
03:23:57,380 --> 03:23:57,940
What did that mean?

3495
03:23:59,340 --> 03:24:00,160
What just happened?

3496
03:24:01,100 --> 03:24:05,460
Also, Minto has like 7 things of mac and cheese so everybody can have one.

3497
03:24:06,020 --> 03:24:08,300
Nobody will go hungry in this household.

3498
03:24:09,480 --> 03:24:10,880
She's a dumpster diver.

3499
03:24:12,700 --> 03:24:14,360
Minto, you don't need to do that.

3500
03:24:17,900 --> 03:24:20,040
This is their house by the way, everybody.

3501
03:24:20,280 --> 03:24:21,900
It's in the shape of an M.

3502
03:24:22,420 --> 03:24:24,960
Because I'm Mint and she's Mitara.

3503
03:24:25,600 --> 03:24:29,580
And this is my side of the house and this is Mitara's side of the house.

3504
03:24:30,060 --> 03:24:34,040
And so you can see we have a little thing connecting us here.

3505
03:24:34,040 --> 03:24:35,860
There's a window right here.

3506
03:24:40,720 --> 03:24:43,260
And then we have our...

3507
03:24:43,260 --> 03:24:47,200
Then I have a balcony where I can come up here and look into Mitara's space.

3508
03:24:47,580 --> 03:24:49,880
Anytime that I please.

3509
03:24:57,120 --> 03:24:58,460
There's a pool.

3510
03:24:58,460 --> 03:24:58,640
There's a pool.

3511
03:25:03,020 --> 03:25:04,480
Yeah, go eat girl.

3512
03:25:04,860 --> 03:25:05,420
What are you doing?

3513
03:25:06,040 --> 03:25:07,580
What do you mean there's no actions available?

3514
03:25:08,400 --> 03:25:10,040
Mitara is ruining it.

3515
03:25:10,700 --> 03:25:11,320
Ok, there we go.

3516
03:25:11,440 --> 03:25:12,060
Grab a bowl.

3517
03:25:14,760 --> 03:25:16,760
Chucky cheesy is so cute.

3518
03:25:19,180 --> 03:25:20,780
She has to go all the way around.

3519
03:25:22,120 --> 03:25:23,320
Yeah, sometimes it gets a little hard.

3520
03:25:23,380 --> 03:25:25,460
There's a front door for each of us but...

3521
03:25:27,680 --> 03:25:29,460
Ok, are you going to sleep?

3522
03:25:29,740 --> 03:25:31,120
Girl, no, you have to call up.

3523
03:25:31,820 --> 03:25:33,620
You have to call your guy, your man.

3524
03:25:36,820 --> 03:25:40,420
Ok, we'll let her sleep for a little bit and then we'll have her call Bruce.

3525
03:25:46,230 --> 03:25:46,590
Ok.

3526
03:25:52,920 --> 03:25:56,020
Ok, we're gonna have you go to the bathroom.

3527
03:25:58,280 --> 03:26:00,220
Mint 2024, stop getting pregnant.

3528
03:26:00,320 --> 03:26:01,440
Mint 2035, get pregnant.

3529
03:26:01,900 --> 03:26:02,560
Mitara caught.

3530
03:26:03,600 --> 03:26:04,360
It's Bruce!

3531
03:26:04,580 --> 03:26:05,100
Oh my god!

3532
03:26:05,660 --> 03:26:06,900
He wants to talk to her.

3533
03:26:08,140 --> 03:26:09,560
He wants to talk to Mint.

3534
03:26:09,900 --> 03:26:10,060
Wait.

3535
03:26:11,460 --> 03:26:12,280
Wait a second.

3536
03:26:14,060 --> 03:26:14,540
Wait.

3537
03:26:16,180 --> 03:26:17,500
No, that sounds like... Wait.

3538
03:26:19,540 --> 03:26:19,800
Wait.

3539
03:26:21,620 --> 03:26:22,300
Wait, what?

3540
03:26:23,060 --> 03:26:23,880
Character growth?

3541
03:26:24,180 --> 03:26:25,580
No, don't say that.

3542
03:26:26,200 --> 03:26:29,080
Wait, it sounds like a... No, wait.

3543
03:26:30,900 --> 03:26:32,560
Ok, we're gonna take a shower.

3544
03:26:36,260 --> 03:26:38,920
Yeah, she's literally on the phone with this guy.

3545
03:26:40,720 --> 03:26:42,980
I didn't know they knew each other like that.

3546
03:26:44,560 --> 03:26:46,940
You are simply the coolest Sim I've met in ages.

3547
03:26:47,080 --> 03:26:49,240
I'm going to spread the word to everyone I know.

3548
03:26:49,240 --> 03:26:51,960
Minto, your reputation is on the way up.

3549
03:26:58,350 --> 03:26:59,750
Look, that's what he says.

3550
03:27:01,530 --> 03:27:03,330
I'm gonna put you guys on this side for this game.

3551
03:27:03,390 --> 03:27:03,930
I hope that's ok.

3552
03:27:08,050 --> 03:27:10,330
She just... I don't think...

3553
03:27:11,430 --> 03:27:13,190
Wait, what's the issue?

3554
03:27:13,370 --> 03:27:14,890
Why is your environment bad?

3555
03:27:18,100 --> 03:27:23,660
Ok, Matara, call Sim.

3556
03:27:25,480 --> 03:27:27,560
Yes, call him.

3557
03:27:30,080 --> 03:27:32,720
Ok, call Bruce.

3558
03:27:33,040 --> 03:27:37,480
Even though he is a two-timing little scumbag.

3559
03:27:38,180 --> 03:27:38,640
What?

3560
03:27:38,800 --> 03:27:39,700
He didn't answer.

3561
03:27:39,920 --> 03:27:40,680
No way.

3562
03:27:41,160 --> 03:27:43,500
Call Bruce.

3563
03:27:43,640 --> 03:27:44,240
Call him again.

3564
03:27:44,840 --> 03:27:45,940
Ok, Bruce.

3565
03:27:47,740 --> 03:27:49,120
He's not answering.

3566
03:27:50,420 --> 03:27:51,600
Oh my god.

3567
03:27:55,760 --> 03:27:56,960
Girl, you don't have to do that.

3568
03:27:57,000 --> 03:27:57,880
That's not your job.

3569
03:28:00,080 --> 03:28:01,040
Call Bruce.

3570
03:28:01,620 --> 03:28:03,960
Do you think she's being needy or... no.

3571
03:28:04,660 --> 03:28:06,560
He was just on the phone with Minto though.

3572
03:28:07,120 --> 03:28:08,580
I cannot believe this.

3573
03:28:15,880 --> 03:28:16,700
Ok, hold on.

3574
03:28:16,820 --> 03:28:18,460
We're gonna wait like an hour.

3575
03:28:21,920 --> 03:28:22,500
Ok.

3576
03:28:23,960 --> 03:28:24,640
No, don't chat.

3577
03:28:25,040 --> 03:28:27,320
Go call Sim.

3578
03:28:28,600 --> 03:28:29,620
Call Bruce.

3579
03:28:34,160 --> 03:28:35,540
He's busy, bro.

3580
03:28:37,760 --> 03:28:39,800
Maybe if we ask him on a date instead.

3581
03:28:40,580 --> 03:28:42,440
Don't toss the cat in the air.

3582
03:28:43,180 --> 03:28:44,320
I like how Minto is juggling.

3583
03:28:57,640 --> 03:28:58,120
He's...

3584
03:28:58,120 --> 03:28:59,820
What if Minto calls him?

3585
03:28:59,940 --> 03:29:00,460
Ok, let's try.

3586
03:29:00,600 --> 03:29:00,980
Minto.

3587
03:29:01,500 --> 03:29:01,980
Call.

3588
03:29:02,840 --> 03:29:03,120
Sim.

3589
03:29:05,680 --> 03:29:07,900
Ok, he's not answering for anyone.

3590
03:29:08,000 --> 03:29:08,960
Maybe he's at work.

3591
03:29:09,420 --> 03:29:09,880
Ok, hold on.

3592
03:29:10,700 --> 03:29:13,220
Matara doesn't have... I mean neither of them have jobs.

3593
03:29:13,860 --> 03:29:15,240
Minto, go find a job.

3594
03:29:15,520 --> 03:29:17,000
Isn't that part of what you want to do?

3595
03:29:18,260 --> 03:29:19,180
A business.

3596
03:29:20,680 --> 03:29:21,180
Wait.

3597
03:29:21,800 --> 03:29:22,980
Sell your little robot.

3598
03:29:25,380 --> 03:29:26,480
She sold him.

3599
03:29:26,620 --> 03:29:26,680
Ok.

3600
03:29:33,580 --> 03:29:34,080
Call...

3601
03:29:34,080 --> 03:29:34,940
Nevermind.

3602
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:35,600
She's going to sleep.

3603
03:29:36,520 --> 03:29:38,440
And so is Matara.

3604
03:29:38,740 --> 03:29:39,360
Ok, hold on.

3605
03:29:42,620 --> 03:29:43,120
What the?

3606
03:29:43,920 --> 03:29:45,280
Why are you guys in the same bed?

3607
03:29:46,540 --> 03:29:47,380
When did this happen?

3608
03:29:50,990 --> 03:29:52,870
And they're having the same dream.

3609
03:29:55,050 --> 03:29:56,710
Oh, I think they don't like the TV.

3610
03:29:56,950 --> 03:29:58,190
How do they hear it?

3611
03:29:58,630 --> 03:30:00,010
It's in the other room.

3612
03:30:05,100 --> 03:30:06,340
Go turn it off, Matara.

3613
03:30:06,540 --> 03:30:07,640
And then...

3614
03:30:09,340 --> 03:30:10,300
Call... Sim.

3615
03:30:13,360 --> 03:30:14,320
Oh my gosh.

3616
03:30:14,360 --> 03:30:15,740
This is so scandalous.

3617
03:30:15,880 --> 03:30:17,040
I can't believe this is happening.

3618
03:30:17,560 --> 03:30:18,460
No way.

3619
03:30:18,900 --> 03:30:19,840
He hates her.

3620
03:30:22,940 --> 03:30:24,120
He hates her.

3621
03:30:24,180 --> 03:30:24,280
He hates her.

3622
03:30:24,280 --> 03:30:24,620
Ok, hold on.

3623
03:30:24,720 --> 03:30:25,840
We're going to...

3624
03:30:26,520 --> 03:30:27,000
Ok.

3625
03:30:27,600 --> 03:30:29,740
Chucky Cheesy is sleeping too.

3626
03:30:29,860 --> 03:30:30,620
Everybody is asleep.

3627
03:30:30,700 --> 03:30:31,560
Everybody is good.

3628
03:30:33,100 --> 03:30:33,580
Ok.

3629
03:30:34,100 --> 03:30:34,800
It's... Alright.

3630
03:30:34,940 --> 03:30:37,680
He should be getting off at like... Let's say 6 at the latest.

3631
03:30:37,940 --> 03:30:38,180
Right?

3632
03:30:41,920 --> 03:30:42,400
6.

3633
03:30:42,400 --> 03:30:42,880
Ok.

3634
03:30:43,300 --> 03:30:43,560
Alright.

3635
03:30:44,320 --> 03:30:44,800
Now...

3636
03:30:44,800 --> 03:30:46,600
Go call your Sim.

3637
03:30:46,740 --> 03:30:47,320
Go call him.

3638
03:30:47,520 --> 03:30:48,060
Go call him.

3639
03:30:48,260 --> 03:30:48,460
Ok.

3640
03:30:48,460 --> 03:30:48,500
Alright.

3641
03:30:49,320 --> 03:30:50,460
Here we go.

3642
03:30:53,280 --> 03:30:54,240
Invite over.

3643
03:30:54,460 --> 03:30:54,760
Yes!

3644
03:30:54,980 --> 03:30:55,180
Ok.

3645
03:30:55,420 --> 03:30:55,880
Wake up!

3646
03:30:56,200 --> 03:30:56,460
Minto.

3647
03:30:56,620 --> 03:30:57,360
Wake up.

3648
03:30:57,600 --> 03:30:57,980
Wake up.

3649
03:30:58,540 --> 03:30:59,800
Can my friend come too?

3650
03:31:08,760 --> 03:31:10,080
What do you guys think?

3651
03:31:12,500 --> 03:31:14,920
It's not a date, but...

3652
03:31:15,980 --> 03:31:18,760
We could have her also...

3653
03:31:18,760 --> 03:31:18,960
Oh.

3654
03:31:23,240 --> 03:31:26,300
I didn't press anything, but it just automatically selected for me.

3655
03:31:29,360 --> 03:31:30,700
What if it's a girl?

3656
03:31:30,920 --> 03:31:31,560
It won't be.

3657
03:31:31,680 --> 03:31:32,040
It won't be.

3658
03:31:32,100 --> 03:31:32,500
It won't be.

3659
03:31:33,700 --> 03:31:34,400
No way.

3660
03:31:36,220 --> 03:31:37,580
Matara-Kan, I swear to god.

3661
03:31:39,340 --> 03:31:39,800
What?

3662
03:31:45,460 --> 03:31:48,460
How about we have some more?

3663
03:31:49,020 --> 03:31:50,680
Mac and cheese.

3664
03:31:51,140 --> 03:31:53,980
The best meal of the day.

3665
03:31:55,240 --> 03:31:57,820
Is a mac and cheese meal.

3666
03:31:59,380 --> 03:31:59,980
Oh, is he here?

3667
03:32:01,740 --> 03:32:03,720
Matara, greet your man.

3668
03:32:04,620 --> 03:32:05,860
Greet Bruce.

3669
03:32:06,200 --> 03:32:07,180
It is a girl!

3670
03:32:07,260 --> 03:32:07,860
Oh, nevermind.

3671
03:32:08,040 --> 03:32:08,700
I think that's...

3672
03:32:09,900 --> 03:32:11,200
Just someone else.

3673
03:32:12,240 --> 03:32:13,820
Someone not related.

3674
03:32:24,920 --> 03:32:26,360
Move in!

3675
03:32:27,680 --> 03:32:29,020
Hell no!

3676
03:32:29,420 --> 03:32:30,420
What is a goose?

3677
03:32:31,360 --> 03:32:32,680
What is a goose blurt?

3678
03:32:33,720 --> 03:32:33,960
Huh?

3679
03:32:39,740 --> 03:32:41,280
Be made out with.

3680
03:32:41,560 --> 03:32:42,680
Oh, she's making out with him.

3681
03:32:43,000 --> 03:32:43,160
Wait.

3682
03:32:43,560 --> 03:32:45,080
Be BFFs.

3683
03:32:46,760 --> 03:32:48,060
Wait, what's the goose?

3684
03:32:49,360 --> 03:32:50,500
Talk to me, goose.

3685
03:32:53,200 --> 03:32:54,440
Talk to me, goose.

3686
03:32:55,200 --> 03:32:55,600
Ah!

3687
03:32:59,020 --> 03:33:00,780
Ok, they made out.

3688
03:33:00,920 --> 03:33:02,200
So now relax.

3689
03:33:02,400 --> 03:33:03,180
Go relax.

3690
03:33:03,560 --> 03:33:05,160
Can I invite him?

3691
03:33:07,100 --> 03:33:07,900
Invite.

3692
03:33:07,960 --> 03:33:08,700
Invite maybe.

3693
03:33:10,140 --> 03:33:12,520
Invite to relax.

3694
03:33:15,180 --> 03:33:21,440
When she relaxes maybe she will also have him...

3695
03:33:21,440 --> 03:33:23,620
Oh, ask Bruce to join.

3696
03:33:23,780 --> 03:33:24,860
You guys.

3697
03:33:25,140 --> 03:33:25,600
You guys.

3698
03:33:25,740 --> 03:33:26,160
You guys.

3699
03:33:26,220 --> 03:33:26,580
It's happening.

3700
03:33:26,940 --> 03:33:27,300
You guys.

3701
03:33:27,680 --> 03:33:28,000
You guys.

3702
03:33:28,180 --> 03:33:29,420
Minto, I think you need to...

3703
03:33:29,420 --> 03:33:29,740
Minto.

3704
03:33:30,300 --> 03:33:30,760
Minto.

3705
03:33:32,700 --> 03:33:33,820
Go spin.

3706
03:33:34,820 --> 03:33:35,280
Hard.

3707
03:33:37,620 --> 03:33:38,540
Oh my god.

3708
03:33:38,920 --> 03:33:39,480
You guys.

3709
03:33:46,570 --> 03:33:48,270
How do I know if she gets pregnant?

3710
03:34:04,500 --> 03:34:05,240
Vibrate?

3711
03:34:05,860 --> 03:34:07,200
Does she do that?

3712
03:34:15,200 --> 03:34:15,940
Wait,

3713
03:34:23,160 --> 03:34:23,920
why won't they woohoo?

3714
03:34:24,600 --> 03:34:26,420
Keep kissing and woohoo then.

3715
03:34:27,100 --> 03:34:27,700
Woo.

3716
03:34:31,740 --> 03:34:32,800
She's saying it.

3717
03:34:32,840 --> 03:34:33,980
She's saying woohoo.

3718
03:34:39,220 --> 03:34:40,800
Ok, she's taking a shower.

3719
03:34:42,620 --> 03:34:44,180
Oh, this is horrible.

3720
03:34:45,880 --> 03:34:46,520
Make out!

3721
03:34:47,140 --> 03:34:48,780
Oh my god, it's proceeding.

3722
03:34:49,160 --> 03:34:50,240
It's escalating.

3723
03:34:51,580 --> 03:34:53,680
Oh no, I think he loves her.

3724
03:34:53,960 --> 03:34:55,220
She doesn't love you!

3725
03:34:55,940 --> 03:34:58,800
It's just a... Oh no, I think he's in love with her.

3726
03:34:59,540 --> 03:35:01,900
Oh, you're gonna get your little heart broken, mister.

3727
03:35:05,280 --> 03:35:08,420
You are just... Bruce, you are just number one.

3728
03:35:08,560 --> 03:35:09,060
Wait, what?

3729
03:35:09,180 --> 03:35:10,220
I mean...

3730
03:35:11,320 --> 03:35:13,400
Usually, don't these guys have like...

3731
03:35:13,400 --> 03:35:15,360
They wanna woohoo with so many people.

3732
03:35:18,480 --> 03:35:19,540
What's Minto up to?

3733
03:35:20,320 --> 03:35:21,800
Oh, hell yeah.

3734
03:35:26,160 --> 03:35:27,300
Oh yeah!

3735
03:35:34,100 --> 03:35:35,460
Ok, now...

3736
03:35:36,760 --> 03:35:40,480
Which, which, which, which...

3737
03:35:40,480 --> 03:35:41,760
Are they not the same thing?

3738
03:35:52,240 --> 03:35:54,100
Uh-oh, what's happening?

3739
03:35:54,240 --> 03:35:54,720
Where is she going?

3740
03:35:55,120 --> 03:35:56,620
Oh, she's being shooed away.

3741
03:35:57,660 --> 03:35:58,560
No way.

3742
03:36:02,980 --> 03:36:04,880
Oh god, the eyeballs.

3743
03:36:15,700 --> 03:36:18,040
I can't see... Oh my...

3744
03:36:26,740 --> 03:36:28,400
The woohoo.

3745
03:36:28,840 --> 03:36:30,320
The woohoo symbol.

3746
03:36:31,540 --> 03:36:33,560
Ew, he's whispering to her.

3747
03:36:34,800 --> 03:36:34,900
Ew.

3748
03:36:35,300 --> 03:36:35,800
Oh.

3749
03:36:37,760 --> 03:36:39,220
What's Minto up to?

3750
03:36:41,800 --> 03:36:43,460
Give him some love.

3751
03:36:44,320 --> 03:36:47,040
This is where we get a peek at Freaky Minky.

3752
03:36:47,520 --> 03:36:48,640
No way!

3753
03:36:48,760 --> 03:36:49,640
That's not me!

3754
03:36:51,680 --> 03:36:55,240
I like how he kinda looks like an otter.

3755
03:36:57,440 --> 03:36:59,700
I didn't want to pee!

3756
03:37:01,480 --> 03:37:03,280
Can I... Wait.

3757
03:37:05,680 --> 03:37:07,540
Ew, why does he growl like that?

3758
03:37:08,760 --> 03:37:09,280
Wait, ok.

3759
03:37:09,400 --> 03:37:10,860
So let's try for the baby.

3760
03:37:12,040 --> 03:37:13,200
Let's try for the baby.

3761
03:37:13,540 --> 03:37:14,520
Baby, baby, baby.

3762
03:37:15,500 --> 03:37:15,820
Sleep?

3763
03:37:15,940 --> 03:37:16,360
No, no, no.

3764
03:37:16,420 --> 03:37:17,180
Wake up, wake up.

3765
03:37:17,360 --> 03:37:18,660
Ok, now you're gonna relax.

3766
03:37:19,880 --> 03:37:20,520
You're gonna relax.

3767
03:37:20,560 --> 03:37:21,800
This guy is... Ok.

3768
03:37:22,120 --> 03:37:22,780
No, no, no, no, no.

3769
03:37:23,020 --> 03:37:23,460
No eating.

3770
03:37:23,820 --> 03:37:24,240
No eating.

3771
03:37:24,360 --> 03:37:24,660
No eating.

3772
03:37:25,500 --> 03:37:26,380
Come here, come here, come here, come here.

3773
03:37:26,520 --> 03:37:27,280
You're gonna relax.

3774
03:37:27,400 --> 03:37:28,800
You're gonna invite...

3775
03:37:29,720 --> 03:37:30,040
Wait.

3776
03:37:30,880 --> 03:37:31,940
Ask Bruce to join.

3777
03:37:31,940 --> 03:37:32,960
No, no, no.

3778
03:37:33,200 --> 03:37:33,480
No.

3779
03:37:34,140 --> 03:37:35,180
Relax, please.

3780
03:37:35,460 --> 03:37:38,640
Ok, then you're gonna try for baby.

3781
03:37:39,940 --> 03:37:40,540
No!

3782
03:37:40,540 --> 03:37:41,140
No!

3783
03:37:41,880 --> 03:37:43,320
Try for baby.

3784
03:37:46,620 --> 03:37:47,220
Try...

3785
03:37:48,460 --> 03:37:50,100
Relax, relax, relax.

3786
03:37:50,200 --> 03:37:50,560
It's chill.

3787
03:37:50,740 --> 03:37:51,220
It's chill.

3788
03:37:51,300 --> 03:37:51,600
We're chill.

3789
03:37:51,700 --> 03:37:51,980
We're chill.

3790
03:37:53,300 --> 03:37:54,480
And try for baby.

3791
03:37:56,180 --> 03:37:56,780
Ok.

3792
03:37:57,140 --> 03:37:57,580
Ok.

3793
03:37:58,060 --> 03:37:58,480
Alright.

3794
03:38:05,510 --> 03:38:07,310
Does that mean... Does that mean baby?

3795
03:38:08,190 --> 03:38:09,230
Does that mean baby?

3796
03:38:09,430 --> 03:38:10,510
Does that mean baby?

3797
03:38:10,650 --> 03:38:11,430
Does that mean baby?

3798
03:38:11,550 --> 03:38:12,330
Does that mean baby?

3799
03:38:12,430 --> 03:38:13,330
Does that mean baby?

3800
03:38:14,030 --> 03:38:15,250
Does that mean baby?

3801
03:38:18,850 --> 03:38:20,510
Matara's first baby...

3802
03:38:23,940 --> 03:38:25,100
Is happening.

3803
03:38:25,860 --> 03:38:28,560
And we're gonna end it here, guys.

3804
03:38:30,900 --> 03:38:32,100
This was fun.

3805
03:38:32,460 --> 03:38:34,640
Thank you guys for the sims.

3806
03:38:34,640 --> 03:38:37,500
Matara is successfully pregnant.

3807
03:38:38,100 --> 03:38:39,500
And he's leaving.

3808
03:38:40,300 --> 03:38:41,320
After all of that.

3809
03:38:47,760 --> 03:38:50,080
He said, you know what?

3810
03:38:50,500 --> 03:38:52,320
I think I'm good.

3811
03:38:53,440 --> 03:38:59,160
And we probably never have to hear from Bruce ever again.

3812
03:39:00,340 --> 03:39:00,840
I think.

3813
03:39:01,720 --> 03:39:02,740
Bruce is done.

3814
03:39:02,900 --> 03:39:04,080
We're over Bruce.

3815
03:39:04,080 --> 03:39:06,000
It's time for our next victim.

3816
03:39:06,860 --> 03:39:08,720
One baby down, 99 to go.

3817
03:39:10,100 --> 03:39:14,080
I have 99 problems and they will all soon be babies.

3818
03:39:19,130 --> 03:39:20,990
But yeah, thank you guys.

3819
03:39:21,350 --> 03:39:22,650
I hope this was fun.

3820
03:39:22,790 --> 03:39:23,770
I got really invested.

3821
03:39:24,690 --> 03:39:26,390
In trying to make everything work.

3822
03:39:28,850 --> 03:39:30,390
Ew, why Minto?

3823
03:39:30,490 --> 03:39:31,730
You were sleeping in their bed.

3824
03:39:32,070 --> 03:39:33,450
She's thinking about the woohoo.

3825
03:39:33,950 --> 03:39:34,970
Is she thinking about him?

3826
03:39:37,690 --> 03:39:38,750
Minto cheesy.

3827
03:39:39,530 --> 03:39:42,250
Girl, get some standards.

3828
03:39:43,990 --> 03:39:45,470
Have some standards.

3829
03:39:45,570 --> 03:39:46,070
Where's the maid?

3830
03:39:46,130 --> 03:39:46,690
There she is.

3831
03:39:46,950 --> 03:39:47,550
Thank goodness.

3832
03:39:50,370 --> 03:39:52,030
She's gonna start cleaning up.

3833
03:39:52,070 --> 03:39:52,450
You're okay.

3834
03:39:54,850 --> 03:39:55,930
This was fun though.

3835
03:39:57,750 --> 03:39:59,490
O2 Minto everybody.

3836
03:40:01,450 --> 03:40:04,170
I will see you guys when I see you next.

3837
03:40:04,170 --> 03:40:05,830
I gotta finish my salad.

3838
03:40:06,970 --> 03:40:09,770
Oh my god, they woohooed literally in front of my salad.

3839
03:40:10,670 --> 03:40:11,150
Actually.

3840
03:40:11,950 --> 03:40:13,390
Thank you for the super chat.

3841
03:40:13,930 --> 03:40:14,590
Such a fun stream.

3842
03:40:14,710 --> 03:40:16,630
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3843
03:40:16,650 --> 03:40:17,690
I hope you guys had fun.

3844
03:40:20,950 --> 03:40:22,430
Coping by copulating.

3845
03:40:22,830 --> 03:40:24,090
No, don't say that.

3846
03:40:25,610 --> 03:40:26,570
Thank you guys.

3847
03:40:26,730 --> 03:40:29,610
Maybe next time we'll add some more characters too, right?

3848
03:40:29,610 --> 03:40:33,470
So, yeah.

3849
03:40:37,330 --> 03:40:39,990
I think I'll make some mac and cheese tonight.

3850
03:40:40,910 --> 03:40:44,170
Mac and cheese and get luckies.

3851
03:40:47,230 --> 03:40:48,730
Cheesy cheesy family.

3852
03:40:49,350 --> 03:40:50,350
Yeah, add Kiara.

3853
03:40:50,590 --> 03:40:53,610
If Kiara will let me, I'll add her to the family, yes.

3854
03:40:56,610 --> 03:40:57,410
O2 Minto.

3855
03:40:58,030 --> 03:40:58,850
Thank you everybody.

3856
03:40:59,470 --> 03:41:01,190
Itterasshai, itterasshai, itterasshai.

3857
03:41:01,870 --> 03:41:02,950
Bye bye, bye bye.

3858
03:41:03,010 --> 03:41:03,550
Thank you.

3859
03:41:04,130 --> 03:41:05,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3860
03:41:05,310 --> 03:41:06,430
Bye bye, bye bye.

3861
03:41:06,750 --> 03:41:07,490
Oh wait, what did I say?

3862
03:41:07,630 --> 03:41:07,850
Sorry.

3863
03:41:08,490 --> 03:41:09,750
Thank you for all the super chats.

3864
03:41:10,310 --> 03:41:14,530
I have an announcement about a joke, but I will announce it in the next stream.

3865
03:41:17,590 --> 03:41:17,990
OK.

3866
03:41:20,830 --> 03:41:23,650
I should have my schedule up for the week soon.

3867
03:41:24,350 --> 03:41:25,690
Yeah, I have it.

3868
03:41:26,010 --> 03:41:27,350
I have it made.

3869
03:41:27,350 --> 03:41:28,070
