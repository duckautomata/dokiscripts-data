1
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,060
Oh, Snuffy's here!

2
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,080
Ah, the gang's all here.

3
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,380
Hey, Snuffy.

4
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,120
You're in trouble.

5
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,420
Hi, guys.

6
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,160
How are you?

7
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,310
Everything's cool.

8
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,470
Kinda crazy.

9
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,370
If you were hanging out with me in real life, you were hanging out with an AI version of me.

10
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,230
You were playing me?

11
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,170
No, nobody could ever replace you at all.

12
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,870
This sounds really desperate right now.

13
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,330
Every time she played League, I saw...

14
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,130
I'll have you know that somebody is defaming your name.

15
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,130
They are framing you...

16
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:37,930
Your most popular AI personality is literally just wrote to be like, admitting how bad you are at video games.

17
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,330
Everything you say is just like, I need to be carried.

18
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,210
I am so bad.

19
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,810
I don't even know how to use a controller.

20
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,850
I'm Limealicious.

21
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,130
I'm Limealicious.

22
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:52,370
But why are you hanging out with AI version of her instead of the actual version of her, huh?

23
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,330
It was practice.

24
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,010
It was practice for me.

25
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,670
If you need me to talk mean about myself to you, Snuffy, I will do, I guess.

26
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:03,850
Oh, no!

27
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:10,710
Oh, so my cause gives you social anxiety so you have to talk to a computer version of her?

28
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,170
It's like trying to make a doctor's appointment.

29
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,530
What?

30
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,910
AI friendships.

31
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,290
What if you like, do you like that AI Limealicious?

32
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,970
What if you like her more than real Limealicious?

33
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,390
Yeah, yeah, what do you do?

34
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,810
I don't, I don't.

35
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,810
She's a mockery.

36
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,090
I was fighting for my queen's behalf.

37
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,030
Okay, I trust you.

38
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,830
I trust you, Snuffy.

39
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,430
I trust you.

40
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,350
Then why didn't you tell her?

41
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,150
Why did you have to get snitched out?

42
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,850
I'm here now.

43
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,290
I'm here to relay the news.

44
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,530
But you were late talking to AI Limealicious.

45
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,530
Talking to me!

46
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,170
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

47
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,710
I thought the collab started at...

48
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,270
Yeah?

49
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,590
Hold on a fucking second.

50
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,690
Are we doing a collab at 11 p.m.

51
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,230
my time on a Tuesday, which is exactly when the Steam servers die?

52
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:01,810
No.

53
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,390
Wait, no, don't say that.

54
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,430
No.

55
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,450
Wait.

56
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,270
No.

57
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,030
I just disconnected from Steam, so yes, yes, we are.

58
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,370
Wait, how long?

59
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,010
Wait, I'm still on?

60
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,910
Oh my god, there's nobody online.

61
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,870
I'm stronger.

62
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:21,570
I'm stronger.

63
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:22,750
You guys.

64
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,290
How long?

65
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,850
How long does it take?

66
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,190
Is it like an hour?

67
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:33,830
No, it could be, it could be like a little bit and sometimes it takes a while for everyone to like stagger back on.

68
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,330
So it could be a little while.

69
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:35,590
No, don't say that.

70
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,430
I just, I just want to absolve myself.

71
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,950
I didn't pick the time.

72
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,650
I didn't choose the time.

73
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,390
I didn't choose the time.

74
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:47,990
Wait, I was trying to be accommodating to the only EU person here.

75
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,670
I'm just trying to be accommodating.

76
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,290
Oh yeah, fuck me for trying to be accommodating to the one person that's across the world.

77
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,270
I'll never do that again.

78
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,310
I'll make sure to do it in my time.

79
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,570
AM starts only, motherfucker.

80
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,170
How was I supposed to know?

81
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,790
I even dressed up and everything.

82
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,890
I took off my swimsuit.

83
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,170
Look what I look like.

84
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,030
I even dressed up.

85
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,590
Oh god, I'm going to go look at you.

86
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,090
I'm going to go look.

87
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,150
I'm going to go look.

88
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,610
I still have my uniform on.

89
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,690
I even got my little booster box so I can dance.

90
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,810
Your booster box?

91
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,480
Where is it?

92
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,780
Oh, that's so funny.

93
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,500
I even have my box.

94
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,330
I even have my cap in there.

95
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:51,030
I put a uniform on and everything and Steam servers are down.

96
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,050
What do you mean?

97
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,750
I mean, sometimes they come back within like 10 minutes or so.

98
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,250
Wait, it's back.

99
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,130
It's back.

100
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,930
How do you know?

101
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,050
Oh my god.

102
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,530
How do you guys know?

103
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,490
I have yet to return.

104
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,150
I have yet to... I'm still barred from the horizon.

105
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,290
I got it.

106
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:12,970
I'm stronger.

107
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,090
Wait, are you guys like in the multiplayer?

108
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,570
How do you know it's back?

109
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,430
Because my Steam friend list came online.

110
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,530
Yeah, it came back online.

111
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,830
This is what you get for talking with AI, Snuffy.

112
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,350
This is punishment for...

113
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:33,050
Maybe Snuffy actually saved us because otherwise we would have been in the middle of something when the servers went down.

114
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:40,870
He said literally everyone on my Steam list has been online, like last online 31 days ago for everybody.

115
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:41,990
Maybe that'll do it.

116
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,090
Warming Steam was unable to sync your fast food simulator prologue saves.

117
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,350
Okay, so since I don't have any saves...

118
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,470
I don't have any saves.

119
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,250
I've never booted you before.

120
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,490
I've never had a save too.

121
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,290
So I think you just click on empty, right?

122
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,730
I'm just gonna say fuck you, don't care.

123
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,490
Okay, are we using Lamu's server as well?

124
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,830
The one that's across the ocean?

125
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,310
I'm the only one in Europe.

126
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,030
So if you want a terrible ping, go for it.

127
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,390
Yeah, I know.

128
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,670
I'm still imprisoned in the forbidden zone.

129
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,050
I'm not connected yet.

130
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,710
It sometimes takes a minute.

131
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,410
Just give it a little bit.

132
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,710
Maybe you log out of Steam and log back in.

133
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,870
The other day I was playing Deadlock and it took me like 25 minutes to get back online.

134
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,330
And everyone else was just sitting there like, you've been online for ages.

135
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,450
I thought nobody played this game.

136
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,050
Oh my god, I got on Steam and I forgot that that's how I...

137
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,930
Oh yeah, Mithy, up yourself a little bit more.

138
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,610
Oh, you killed all your VTubing stuff?

139
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,390
Yeah, that happens.

140
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,850
Yeah, I can try.

141
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,470
I don't know why Discord has me so quiet.

142
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,030
Yeah, I have you at 200%, but you're really quiet on my end.

143
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:49,830
I don't know why, because I'm in the red on my own stream.

144
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,710
That's weird.

145
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,950
Did you look at your Discord input?

146
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,370
Yeah, everything's maxed.

147
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,370
What the fuck?

148
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,130
That's so weird.

149
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,430
Yeah, and it's been like with other people's streams too.

150
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,990
So I don't know why people...

151
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,090
Your Discord's shy.

152
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,770
He's a shy little guy.

153
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,150
I turned myself up a little bit.

154
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:16,430
The problem is, I think it's something with Discord or a compression thing on Discord maybe, because like when you say I've turned myself up, it's literally no different.

155
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,200
Yeah, me too, I had no...

156
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,350
It's no difference, but I wanted to wait for someone else to say it.

157
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,630
Could you like maybe screenshot all of your audio settings in Discord?

158
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,510
Yeah, I mean, don't dox me.

159
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,750
I'll dox myself for you guys.

160
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,910
She's been trusting.

161
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,770
I'm not sure I could hack you via your Discord settings, but I'm happy to give it a try.

162
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,370
No, you don't know.

163
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,610
She's been around for a long time on the internet, don't trust her.

164
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,270
She knows.

165
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,950
I'm gonna hack you so hard that we'll have to use Ventrilo.

166
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,650
It'll be great.

167
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,790
Only thing I see is voice codecs.

168
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,210
What the fuck is Ventrilo?

169
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,630
Oh, don't start.

170
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,690
What the fuck is Ventrilo?

171
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,750
Is that an old internet thing?

172
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,710
Yes.

173
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,970
Oh my god, wait, how... I'm sorry.

174
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,730
It's like an old voice program that people used to use for things like multiplayer than TeamSpeak.

175
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,170
Oh, I remember that, yeah.

176
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,510
It was like around the same time as TeamSpeak, I think.

177
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,290
Maybe a little bit older?

178
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:17,990
I don't know.

179
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,090
Oh my god.

180
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:25,250
Snuffy should know what it is, because I explained it to her once while feeling like I was disintegrating into dust at the same fucking time.

181
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,210
Yeah, I was gonna say, how does Snuffy know about it, too?

182
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,350
Because I mentioned it.

183
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,730
It's 2002, I believe.

184
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,650
2002?!

185
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,170
I didn't start using it in 2002!

186
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,110
I was playing backyard baseball at that time.

187
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,850
What was I doing in 2002?

188
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,170
I was getting hacked in Neopets.

189
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,390
Oh yeah, and getting hacked in Neopets, too.

190
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,810
I would've been playing fucking Neopets.

191
00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:02,490
I remember, when I played Neopets, I didn't have the parental form to access the forums, so I had to ask my parents to give me permission.

192
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,350
Parental form?!

193
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,790
Yeah, I did, too!

194
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,670
Yeah, you used to have to get permission if you were under a certain age.

195
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,690
And then, when I was on the forums, I heard about a website called Gaia, and they were like, Gaia is PG-13.

196
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,950
And I was like, I never knew Gaia.

197
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,130
That's where the old people are.

198
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:27,870
Yeah, for the first year that I was using Gaia, I would clear my browsing history afterwards because it was PG-13 and I thought I'd get in trouble.

199
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,550
My mom made me add her as a friend, and she would check my profile every day.

200
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,850
And before she'd tuck me into bed, she'd be like, why were you posting this?

201
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,490
Oh my gosh!

202
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,850
The collab!

203
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,690
My mom was like a bloodhound.

204
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,830
So ominous.

205
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,130
Do you know what my mother used to do?

206
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:58,710
When I used to take a day off of school because I would tell her I felt sick, I would wait for her to leave, and then I would go use the internet, right?

207
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:08,990
But we had dial-up, so what she would do is she would wait, and then she would call the house, and if she couldn't get through, she would send me an email and be like, why are you using the internet?

208
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,990
Oh my god!

209
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,330
That's hardcore.

210
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,130
That's like helicopter parenting, real.

211
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:21,270
Yeah, she'd be like, what are you doing on the PC right now?

212
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,670
My parents didn't care.

213
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,750
I think I lied about my age for Neopets.

214
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,630
I don't remember asking for permission.

215
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,910
I'm pretty sure I did on my second account.

216
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,410
I absolutely did because I didn't want to have to do it again, so I lied.

217
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,110
People dying on the internet, that's crazy.

218
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,990
My parents were buying Neopets.

219
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,850
That was literally the one thing that was like, with your parents' permission.

220
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,510
I remember sitting on the floor as my mom made my Neopets account, and she was like, what is one of your Neopets?

221
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,630
And I was like, I don't know!

222
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,770
I want them to be blue!

223
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,970
Oh my god, you guys played Club Penguin, right?

224
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:58,870
Yes!

225
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,970
No, my little brother did.

226
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,970
Oh, you missed out.

227
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,450
I was roleplaying in Club Penguin as a kid.

228
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,330
Roleplaying the pizza, being the waiter, being like, would you guys like your pizza today?

229
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,090
Yes, all the Club Penguin e-daters!

230
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,650
You were roleplaying having a job?

231
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,350
That's so sad.

232
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,270
That's so sad!

233
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,830
It's like playing with dolls!

234
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,110
Yeah, but my dolls are magical and fantastical.

235
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,270
They're not like, hi, I'm the pizza man.

236
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,710
It was immersive!

237
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,010
That's like a lot of her costumes.

238
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,910
It was immersive!

239
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,110
It was immersive roleplay!

240
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,310
Doki wanted to be a waiter from age 5.

241
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,730
I had a relationship with my brother where anything that my brother liked, I automatically disliked.

242
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,850
I got a little worried there.

243
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,350
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

244
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,170
Wait for me to finish the sentence, Doki!

245
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,290
I'm sorry, but the way you started that sentence was...

246
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,990
All she said was I have a relationship with my brother!

247
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,990
I have a dynamic with my brother.

248
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,370
I could have said that.

249
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,550
I'm sorry, I'll go back and adjust what I said like 30 fucking seconds ago.

250
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,850
But no, my brother played Club Penguin and I played Habbo Hotel, so...

251
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,670
Oh my god, Habbo Hotel.

252
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:35,670
The pool incident?

253
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:36,910
Yeah.

254
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:37,670
What?

255
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,430
The pool incident.

256
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,590
Yeah, the pool incident.

257
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,050
You should have been there.

258
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,710
I wasn't there, but you should have been there.

259
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,310
What's the pool incident?

260
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,910
It was closed for reasons we don't know.

261
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,750
Yeah.

262
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:52,510
What?

263
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,630
It was closed.

264
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,630
Do you actually not know?

265
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,490
Why are you laughing?

266
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,530
How can it be so funny?

267
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,030
It's like an old...

268
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,670
It was closed.

269
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,130
It's not funny.

270
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,630
It's just old internet.

271
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,910
It was closed.

272
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,550
I don't want to go into it.

273
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,910
You just had to be there.

274
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,110
You just had to be there, you know?

275
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,130
How about the AI wouldn't have made me feel so bad?

276
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,250
Oh yeah, ask AI Limelight.

277
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,550
She would tell you why it was closed.

278
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,570
She would tell you.

279
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,410
Do it right now, Snuffy.

280
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,490
Do it right now.

281
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,630
Okay, I'll go.

282
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,410
Hold on, let me deafen and talk to AI Limu.

283
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,170
She's better than the facts.

284
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,830
Is Snuffy actually back online yet?

285
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,410
Because I don't know if we're actually going to get in anyway.

286
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,270
We're trying to wait until Snuffy got back online.

287
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,370
Alright, what does AI Limu say about the problem?

288
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:51,950
She's deafened.

289
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,110
Oh, she's deafened.

290
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,850
She's locking in on this answer.

291
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:57,810
She's locking in.

292
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,630
She has to hear it.

293
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,450
She's trying to win us the fake me.

294
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,470
What the fuck?

295
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,590
Fake you would tell Snuffy.

296
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,890
She's a real one.

297
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,650
She wouldn't withhold information from her good friend, Snuffy.

298
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,790
She wouldn't keep secrets from her.

299
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,630
I'm so curious if we're in the AI voice.

300
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,750
Yeah, because it sounded just like you.

301
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,910
That was the quirky part.

302
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:24,790
That's scary.

303
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,170
It was like characters.ai.

304
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,950
I think that's what it was called.

305
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,030
Oh wait, it said characters.

306
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,830
Sorry, don't type that in the domain.

307
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,570
Because it just takes you to a purchase this.

308
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,190
Okay, characters.ai.

309
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,730
Oh, okay.

310
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,770
Personalize AI for every moment of your day.

311
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,670
Oh my god, they personalize it?

312
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,410
Wait, I'm going to see if Mint's in here.

313
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,850
There's Sans.

314
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,410
Of course, what does Sans sound like?

315
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,050
Wait, you're in here!

316
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:55,910
What?

317
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,790
There's 45.9k people that chatted with you.

318
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,070
What?

319
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,210
Stupid bitch doesn't know anything.

320
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:18,950
Oh my god, I didn't try Mint yet.

321
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,330
Hey, who's talking to me?

322
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,630
This is weird!

323
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,060
We have a hundred and one!

324
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,520
Dude, Dokies, yours is so normal.

325
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
You're literally so... you're just like, oh yeah, really?

326
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,740
Okay, that's cool, man.

327
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,040
Thanks.

328
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,140
Like a non-committal chat on a dating website or something?

329
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,640
Like you say something super sincere and Dokie.ai is just like, okay.

330
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,060
Most of them are parasocial, but Dokies is just like...

331
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,760
I was like, hey Dokie, you ready for that collab?

332
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,500
And she was like, yeah, I'm really going to do my best.

333
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:50,900
Thanks.

334
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,220
That's really normal.

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,640
Dokie is such a normie.

336
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,700
Have you guys seen the... you know how YouTube will sometimes have ways to respond?

337
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,360
Like the automatic responses to comments or stuff?

338
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,260
What?

339
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,080
Like when you're typing an email or something?

340
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,820
Yeah, but someone will be like, great stream today, Mint!

341
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,260
And then it'll give me two options that I can automatically put in.

342
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,260
That's like, thanks for watching!

343
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,540
Yeah, or something like that.

344
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,320
But recently, they've gotten really advanced.

345
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,740
Like how?

346
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,840
There was one that I was baking cookies on stream and I was like, trust the process, you know?

347
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,480
And someone commented that, trust the process.

348
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:38,480
And one of the responses, the AI responses that was telling me to reply back was saying like, I am the process.

349
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,240
I was like, what is this?

350
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,300
I've been screenshotting them because they're so creepy.

351
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,520
I was like, what is this?

352
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,220
My guy knows you.

353
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,720
I know!

354
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,440
It's like reading your microphone too, it's analyzing your data.

355
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,140
It feels very like, in character sometimes too.

356
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,620
So I'm like, nobody would know if it's me or not.

357
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,680
It's weird.

358
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,700
That's so fucking weird.

359
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,220
Yeah.

360
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,400
Holy shit.

361
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,880
I wonder what people are using our...

362
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,340
Like the thing is, they sound like us too.

363
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,060
Don't wonder that.

364
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,420
It goes nowhere good.

365
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,360
850k chats.

366
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,660
That is a hundred.

367
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,900
It must be legit then, probably.

368
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,320
Wait, 820k for Snuffy?

369
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,900
Snuffy, what the...

370
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,760
Wait, oh, she's deaf in herself.

371
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,080
She's playing with AI right now.

372
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,520
Wait.

373
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,080
Wait, she's talking to you!

374
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,380
Why is it telling me to install the game again?

375
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,600
No, no, I was just...

376
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,220
You were talking to me!

377
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:33,700
You linked it!

378
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,900
You linked it!

379
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,820
I clicked your link!

380
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,760
I clicked the link you put.

381
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,860
I clicked it, I clicked it.

382
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,460
I was serious.

383
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,440
You're talking to her!

384
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,240
I didn't say a word, I didn't say a word.

385
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,840
I was simply clicking the link.

386
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,820
I followed my friend's recommendation.

387
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,600
She led me into an alleyway.

388
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,820
Lime, I accepted your invite and then it was just like downloading the game.

389
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,940
So I guess I'm installing the game again.

390
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,540
Wait, why?

391
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,360
Is it because... did you take Fast Food Sim or Fast Food Simulator Prologue?

392
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,380
Because I got linked to Prologue.

393
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,000
Well, Fast Food Sim doesn't exist though.

394
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,140
Yeah, it's not out yet.

395
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,320
So I did Fast Food Sim Prologue.

396
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,620
Oh, I'm in the demo.

397
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,860
I thought I did download it too.

398
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,940
What's the password?

399
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,140
You have a password.

400
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,400
Oh, I didn't set a password.

401
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,720
I think I got the wrong game.

402
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,440
Oh wait, you didn't?

403
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,680
It just says paste a lobby password.

404
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,740
Maybe it has an automatic lobby password.

405
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,480
Yeah, no, it just like let me open it and make it private so I can invite people.

406
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:32,880
That's weird.

407
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,200
I'm like literally in the thing that says lobby password.

408
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,220
I'm gonna get a cough drop real quick, I'll be right back.

409
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,600
Okay.

410
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,180
It's almost done.

411
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,480
I'm starting to think this game may not be the most robust thing in the world.

412
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,660
I don't know why I think that.

413
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:55,220
Hold on, I'm gonna send you guys some examples of like this AI chat or comment responses.

414
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,760
It's so weird.

415
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,520
Like this one, someone's just like, nice, new mint outfit.

416
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,360
And one of them is, I'm wearing a new outfit?

417
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,620
Whoops, lol.

418
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,560
What does that mean?

419
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,140
They're so weird.

420
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:12,680
Alright.

421
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,900
I got you the password, I found it.

422
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Nice, I'm joining.

423
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,080
I'm the first employee.

424
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,740
Honestly, I'm employee of the month at this point.

425
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,980
Yeah, nobody else bothered showing up for this shit.

426
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,080
Yeah, nobody bothered showing up except for me, so technically I'm employee of the month.

427
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,260
Where's everybody else?

428
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,340
Holy shit, the last time I used the reactive thing, it was for Pico Park where I had to make everyone huge so that they could be showed up.

429
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,540
And so now, I just switched over to my gaming thing.

430
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,900
Do I still have the Pico Park one?

431
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,620
You're good, you're good.

432
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,260
No, no, we're waiting until...

433
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,680
My size was set up for that.

434
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,420
Can you send me another invite, please?

435
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,840
I will of course send you another invite, hold on.

436
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,020
Where's the...oh, there's them, I see her.

437
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,740
Hey there, are you ready for a group?

438
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,940
I'm just standing in the parking lot by myself.

439
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,840
It's okay, our manager's not here to see us.

440
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,940
What's she gonna do, fire us?

441
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,580
Wait, I need this job.

442
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,580
Wait, am I the manager though?

443
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,180
Oh, wait, you're the manager because you have the server, so technically, you're the manager.

444
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,840
Well, I probably won't fire you.

445
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,440
I don't know about those Mint and Snuffy people though, because they haven't even shown up, so...

446
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,180
Thank you.

447
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,480
Oh, there it is.

448
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,220
Oh, the lobby password, okay.

449
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,000
Wait, Snuffy, are you back on Steam now?

450
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,760
Yeah, yeah, I'm...

451
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,620
Guys, all my roleplaying as a waiter in Club Penguin has led me to this.

452
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,340
This is it, this is it.

453
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,640
So wait, is this just like Shopping Sim, except it's with a fast food skin?

454
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,580
Why am I so small?

455
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:43,740
It's like TCG, the TCG simulator, but we're fast food workers now.

456
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,240
Who's that?

457
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,420
Oh, hi.

458
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,760
Can I order like an obscene amount of stuff and pile all the cardboard boxes outside like I can do in Shopping Sim?

459
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,420
Because that was funny.

460
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,260
I'm learning the game at the same time as you.

461
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,320
You look like...

462
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,420
I mean, literally, my amount of research was I clicked the thing that you sent me, and then I stopped paying attention.

463
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,500
Maimou, can you help me?

464
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,560
I have a technical problem.

465
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,400
What's your technical problem, my beloved?

466
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,840
It tells me that it runs out of memory.

467
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,260
I think maybe I have to cap it somehow.

468
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,400
You look like the guy from BuzzFeed Unsolved.

469
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,880
Go to your NVIDIA control panel.

470
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,440
Nice, that's always what I wanted to look like.

471
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,440
Should I cap the FPS there?

472
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,560
Yes, yes.

473
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,200
What's going on?

474
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,080
Go to your NVIDIA control panel.

475
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,960
Snuffy's getting problems.

476
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,880
Are you okay, Snuffy?

477
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,340
It's okay, it's all of your AI conversations.

478
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,960
Day one, we did a good job!

479
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,320
Yeah, we made it through day one!

480
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,560
Let's go!

481
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:51,760
Go to manage 3D settings, and then go to program settings, click add, and find the executable for this game.

482
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,120
Did you end the day?

483
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,480
Was it you, Snuffy?

484
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,260
You ended the day and pressed the card, didn't you?

485
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,920
I'm fucking going with you.

486
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,600
Stop looking at the car!

487
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,060
We're not gonna make any money!

488
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,000
It's fine.

489
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,280
Once we get working, the customers will just roll on in.

490
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,740
Alright, I'm so hungry.

491
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,980
Get away from the car.

492
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,820
Everybody loves fast food.

493
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,860
Exactly, because it's fast.

494
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,660
It's fast.

495
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,540
I'm already in here.

496
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,180
I'm confirming.

497
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,360
Turn on the computer.

498
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,280
Are you not going to wait for another employee?

499
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,340
This is a system.

500
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,760
This is an established system.

501
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,680
It's 9am!

502
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,400
Yeah, but we gotta wait for our fourth employee.

503
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,540
She could be the janitor.

504
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,800
I've opened the restaurant.

505
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,140
Oh my god, I could swear to god.

506
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,960
You may have to turn down a bunch of settings as well before joining, if that helps.

507
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,780
Stop opening the restaurant!

508
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,740
Look, somebody's coming!

509
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,100
You're just gonna deny them?

510
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,600
No!

511
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,860
Don't come in!

512
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,060
Don't come in!

513
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,220
We're not open!

514
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,000
We're not open!

515
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,460
You serve it.

516
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,380
I'm not doing anything.

517
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,160
Okay, okay.

518
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,760
They need...

519
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,240
No, Snappy got disconnected!

520
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,560
Have you turned down any of the settings, Snappy?

521
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,280
I'm gonna do that now, I think.

522
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:36,980
Yeah, just turn everything down to minimum, because it might be that some setting has gone out of control and is eating your graphics card.

523
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,180
Because if you can launch it and get to the menu, turn all that shit down.

524
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,220
That's crazy that you're out of video memory.

525
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,640
Like, even if I don't click the cover though, the time is progressing.

526
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,740
It's now 10.30 in the morning, we're at the worst restaurant ever.

527
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,400
We literally only have one customer, that's okay.

528
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,660
Guys, we have no food.

529
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,320
Oh, yeah, I wonder who's gonna open the restaurant without making sure we have the food!

530
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,660
I'm just... I thought we would have food!

531
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,800
Do you want me to order some food?

532
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,520
I think we have to kill this lady.

533
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,620
I'm gonna order some food.

534
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:09,940
Wait, is this the blue guy?

535
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,420
We can Sweeney Todd this, we have a fresh meat right here.

536
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,600
Oh my god, then get her out of... I can't hit her!

537
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,020
There's laws against that!

538
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,460
Who are you trying to assault a customer?

539
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,960
It wasn't my idea.

540
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,880
Oh, go open a market application.

541
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,400
Okay.

542
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,720
Beef patties, burger buns...

543
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,520
Someone said this is just like The Bear.

544
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,280
The funniest comedy show.

545
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,560
I bought some food.

546
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,420
I like watched one episode of The Bear and I've never felt so stressed out.

547
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,480
I don't understand how that's comedy of the year.

548
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,920
Yes, dude, I agree.

549
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,500
I felt like... I was so enthralled by it, but I was also just like...

550
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,280
I'm so uncomfortable.

551
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,920
Can I get myself run over by the delivery truck?

552
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,940
Why can't I run?

553
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,940
Oh my god, I'm in here!

554
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,640
Here I come!

555
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,240
Welcome!

556
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,300
Oh god.

557
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,220
You can't get hit by the delivery truck.

558
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,400
My apologies.

559
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,840
Cheese.

560
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,500
This seems like a waste of delivery truck space.

561
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,960
Maybe I should've ordered something more.

562
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Put it on the floor?

563
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,000
This place is so unsanitary.

564
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,100
Are we ready to work?

565
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,520
We gotta grill a beef patty.

566
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,280
Who's grilling?

567
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,460
I'll grill.

568
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,060
Oh, wait.

569
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,680
I'm just putting the food on the floor because that's always the best place for food.

570
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,560
Can you give enough love to the patty?

571
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,820
This is just like Bob's Burgers.

572
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,580
It is just like Bob's Burgers.

573
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,840
The funny thing is...

574
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,400
The Krusty Krab.

575
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,420
Unless we all learn at the same time, the tutorial is gonna fast forward without us and we're gonna get fucked.

576
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,140
It's okay.

577
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,220
We each have a job.

578
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,020
Put the... Okay, I'm gonna put the patty in the grill.

579
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,260
Oh, hold on.

580
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:45,940
I'm doing it.

581
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,320
Patty on the grills.

582
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,560
Patty on the grills.

583
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,320
Nice.

584
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,880
Patty on the... Wait, I'm gonna make a picture.

585
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,900
And then...

586
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,100
Patty on the grill.

587
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,260
Patty on the grill.

588
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,820
Alright, nice.

589
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,060
Please don't put all the patties on my...

590
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,780
Oh, sorry.

591
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,420
All at the same time!

592
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,280
Okay.

593
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,880
Dude, watch out.

594
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,340
This one is 55% top doneness.

595
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,220
I can do the grill.

596
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,240
Dude, we have one customer!

597
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,140
It's about to burn!

598
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,540
I'll eat them!

599
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,140
Sorry, sorry.

600
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,080
How do I, like, customize what my character looks like?

601
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,620
It's about to burn, Doki!

602
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,720
What if we just...

603
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,760
Doki, Doki, it's burning!

604
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,500
It's burning!

605
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,260
It's burning!

606
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,340
It's burning!

607
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,080
It's burning!

608
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,340
Oh my god, oh my god.

609
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,440
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

610
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,580
Use a spatula.

611
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,740
Oh, it's so much darker than the others.

612
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,300
Where do I get my spatula?

613
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,780
It's not even at 100%.

614
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,040
Okay, this one's at 100%.

615
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,140
But other than that, we're fine.

616
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,840
Is she still here?

617
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,880
I think our lady left.

618
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,300
The lady?

619
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,360
I watched her leave.

620
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,160
I chased her out.

621
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,740
Oh, okay.

622
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,040
That's fine, that's fine.

623
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,060
We're not open.

624
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,640
Everybody, leave.

625
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,320
Where do I put the burgers that are done?

626
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,000
It says, pick the patties from the grill using a burger patty tray.

627
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
Whatever the fuck that is.

628
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,360
What the fuck is a burger patty tray?

629
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,980
Guys, guys, I have the burger done, but...

630
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,180
Yeah, there's a bun right here!

631
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,080
My buns, my buns are right here!

632
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,240
Burger patty tray, burger patty tray.

633
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,780
Burger, put it in my hands.

634
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,540
I can only flip!

635
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,660
Burger patty tray.

636
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,880
How do I gesture?

637
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,060
Where are the emojis?

638
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,440
Is it here?

639
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,600
Right here, right here!

640
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,760
Someone turn this off!

641
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,060
Someone please!

642
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:18,840
Turn it off?

643
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,580
There's no buttons to turn off.

644
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,460
We're here forever.

645
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,540
The gorilla is very done.

646
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,320
This is a hugger.

647
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:24,820
Oh, we did it!

648
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:25,740
Yay!

649
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,980
Oh, this one is undercooked.

650
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,980
That one's good.

651
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,060
This one needs to go back.

652
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,260
No, that's okay, just keep putting...

653
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,800
It's fine, nobody's going to complain.

654
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,940
Too much on one end.

655
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,080
Bottom doneness 149%.

656
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,440
That's fine!

657
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,320
Oh, wrapping paper.

658
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,020
We need the wrapping paper.

659
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,340
We are not a Michelin restaurant.

660
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,340
We are literally a fast food joint.

661
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,080
It's fine.

662
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,280
I've got the wrapping paper, everybody.

663
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,220
Here we are.

664
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,380
Okay.

665
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,980
Place the bun.

666
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,480
Guys, we don't have any customers.

667
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,360
We don't have any customers.

668
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,000
But we're pre-making the burger.

669
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,400
You gotta open it, you gotta open it.

670
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,060
You have to go to the sign you see in the front.

671
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,060
We're pre-making the burgers at 5pm.

672
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,340
Everybody, we're open for business.

673
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,460
Come on in.

674
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,580
Delicious burgers, fresh made just now.

675
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
You can be the sign flipper, Mint.

676
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,400
Oh yeah, I'm going to be the sign twirler.

677
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,780
Yeah, just twirl that sign like, look at these burgers.

678
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,080
Look at these burgers.

679
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,740
Can I have a burger outfit just like the kid from Bob's Burgers?

680
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Put the burger in the wrapping paper and wrap it.

681
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,680
Okay, so Snuffy would be the wrapper.

682
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,160
Do you know how to do it?

683
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,220
I think you're a little confused.

684
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,940
Oh, you got it.

685
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,780
Wait, what about the bun?

686
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,960
Wait, there's no bun.

687
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,060
There's no bun.

688
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,040
I just wrapped it.

689
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,500
Guys, what's our restaurant name?

690
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,500
Okay, we gotta figure out a lot of stuff.

691
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,880
I have to go give this to somebody now.

692
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,900
There's somebody coming in.

693
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,280
Oh, there you go.

694
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,220
I put the burger together.

695
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,080
Look, see?

696
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,060
What's the watcher?

697
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,240
He's coming up.

698
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,740
I'm going to take his order.

699
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,500
Hey, what's your order?

700
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,960
He wants one burger in a bun.

701
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:07,980
I just did!

702
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,980
I pre-made that!

703
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:09,780
In a bun?

704
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,160
I have a bun for him.

705
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,540
This is it right here.

706
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,100
Which one?

707
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:14,940
This one right here.

708
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,780
I pre-made that.

709
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,080
See?

710
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,020
Okay, I'm giving him his wrapped burger.

711
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,700
Hold on.

712
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,260
Hey sir, here's your wrapped burger.

713
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,340
Who the fuck is this?

714
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,320
Did she order?

715
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,680
Put it on a food tray first.

716
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,720
Oh, he wants one burger.

717
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,540
Got it.

718
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,600
Okay, now you can give it to him.

719
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,320
Use the wrapper as a fucking food tray, you...

720
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,280
Alright, here you go.

721
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,440
I did it.

722
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,000
I made one.

723
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,140
Where the fuck is the food tray?

724
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,160
Where is the food tray?

725
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,080
What do you mean I don't have permission?

726
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,240
What's a food tray?

727
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,460
I don't know!

728
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,040
Oh, here they are.

729
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,960
They're down here.

730
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,760
Guys, I think we're meant to be...

731
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,820
That person just said hey at me?

732
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,740
Fuck off, I'm busy.

733
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,660
They want two patties on a burger.

734
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,140
Two patties?

735
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,040
He's so greedy.

736
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,160
Yeah, it's okay.

737
00:31:59,220 --> 00:31:59,680
Okay, wait.

738
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,380
Wait, we have one.

739
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:00,740
Oh, wait.

740
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,520
These two, these two.

741
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

742
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,920
Put these two together.

743
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,360
Yeah.

744
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,120
And I made it with no...

745
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,880
Should we maybe be cooking more burgers?

746
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,700
Oh, whoops.

747
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,980
It's okay, they don't know, they don't know.

748
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,240
They don't know, they don't know.

749
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,860
They don't know, we got more burgies.

750
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,720
Does anybody know which burger this is?

751
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,320
Like, is there a way to keep track?

752
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,440
You think they'll care?

753
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,460
They're literally at a fast food restaurant.

754
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,060
You think they care?

755
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,100
They did care.

756
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,000
It said minus 100 popularity.

757
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
You guys, we need another burger stat.

758
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,360
We need another burger stat.

759
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:29,960
Oh, wait.

760
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,880
Wait, only Lime can rename the fast food restaurant.

761
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,220
Yeah, it's kind of lame.

762
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,940
Which do I name it?

763
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,340
It's up to you.

764
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,420
You're the manager.

765
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,920
How do I name it?

766
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,740
You have to go outside and click the thing.

767
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,360
Wait, we have no meat.

768
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,340
Oh, sorry.

769
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:45,980
Excuse me.

770
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,280
Sorry.

771
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,440
Manager, we need meat.

772
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:50,760
Manager!

773
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,260
Wait, I just took this lady's order.

774
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,640
I tried to order and it said I can't make another order when there's an order already on the way.

775
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,200
So I think someone maybe actually ordered something.

776
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Wait, who made the order?

777
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,100
I didn't order.

778
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,760
Where's the food tray?

779
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,740
What do you want to name the restaurant?

780
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,460
Well, you're the manager, Lime.

781
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,400
Yeah.

782
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,260
Yeah, why are you asking us?

783
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,740
We're just minimum wage workers.

784
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,680
Fine, I named it.

785
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,400
You deal with that now.

786
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,740
I just gave this lady a hamburger and it said negative 100 popularity.

787
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,060
Ok, I might have fucked up the burger.

788
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,140
She didn't even eat it.

789
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,060
Welcome to Sloppy's.

790
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,240
Sloppy's.

791
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,600
Welcome to Sloppy's.

792
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,460
Oh, this guy left a tip.

793
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,320
Oh, wait.

794
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,300
I made the burger.

795
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,380
I should get the tip.

796
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,940
No, no.

797
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,280
I did it.

798
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,540
What?

799
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,280
I made the burger.

800
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,700
What the fuck did you do?

801
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,620
I took his payment.

802
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,040
What?

803
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
Clearly there's more effort in taking the payment.

804
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,800
Oh, we already had more burgies.

805
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,740
Can you sprint?

806
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,740
I don't think I can sprint.

807
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,060
I don't think you can.

808
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,340
I don't think you can.

809
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,060
I don't think we have the energy to.

810
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,300
That's dangerous.

811
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,460
That's not OSHA.

812
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,680
It's running in the workplace, everybody.

813
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,240
There's an order here.

814
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,580
We got an order of food.

815
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,160
We've got a lot of frozen patties coming in hot.

816
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,520
Here's burger wrapping paper.

817
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,840
Alright, here we go.

818
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,560
Frozen patties on the floor.

819
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,420
Alright, I'm putting the burger wrap right now.

820
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,720
I'm putting it down.

821
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,760
We got more wrapping paper.

822
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,480
Can I run?

823
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,420
I cannot run.

824
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,180
What's in here?

825
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,200
I put so many wrapping paper and I'm putting buns right now.

826
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,500
I maybe accidentally ordered like 20 million burgers.

827
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,660
Just now?

828
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,640
Because we just got a whole bunch of orders.

829
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:41,960
That's fine.

830
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,540
That's fine.

831
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,460
We have 600 dollars.

832
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,680
How are we going to eat tonight?

833
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,880
What is that in Celsius?

834
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,260
I don't think that's freezing.

835
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,500
Why do we have so many buns?

836
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,700
Because the game didn't let me order and then it let me order.

837
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,360
I just picked one bun up individually.

838
00:34:59,380 --> 00:34:59,780
Oopsie.

839
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,100
I just picked one up individually.

840
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,880
Oh my God.

841
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,240
We have so many buns.

842
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,200
What is going on in here?

843
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,280
What is going on in here?

844
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,460
You guys, we have no customers.

845
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,180
Why are we making so many buns?

846
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,580
It's 9 PM.

847
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,480
We're closed.

848
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,380
We're closed.

849
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,240
No.

850
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,900
We're a 24 hour joint.

851
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,600
Are we not?

852
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,720
Guys, please.

853
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,940
We reached the end of the day everybody.

854
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,260
I'm turning off the sign.

855
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,000
You cannot close the restaurant while your order is still on the way.

856
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,500
Who the fuck is ordering more things?

857
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,840
You said you ordered like 5,000 things.

858
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,000
How have we done this 200%?

859
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,500
This was not my fault.

860
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,840
This was not my fault.

861
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,920
Somebody put the fucking... Oh my God.

862
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,360
Does this look edible to you?

863
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,460
I think it might be a phantom order.

864
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,860
Hey, don't put this on me.

865
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,340
Guys, we have an issue with our burgers.

866
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,800
That looks incredible.

867
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,280
There is an order that's stuck because it won't let me close the restaurant...

868
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,600
because there is an order on the way, but there is not an order on the way.

869
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,420
Oh my God.

870
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,100
These burgers.

871
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,520
I stole the top bun from that burger before you walked away.

872
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,420
That person is eating an open burger.

873
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,380
Why can't we eat them?

874
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,820
Yeah, this is a black bean burger.

875
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,740
Why can't we fucking leave?

876
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,780
Just let us end the day.

877
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,220
We have to turn the open sign from on to off, guys.

878
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,560
We all have to be near the car.

879
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,720
Guys, it says all players must be near the car.

880
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,260
Nobody has ever worked a job before.

881
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,600
Ok, I'm coming.

882
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,280
I still don't think it's gonna work.

883
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,280
I don't wanna go back to this day.

884
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,400
I wanna move forward.

885
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,560
Yeah, we got this.

886
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,120
We got this.

887
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,400
There we go.

888
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,700
Guys, I don't think we made it anymore.

889
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,740
I don't know if we did.

890
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,040
What a great day.

891
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,140
It's a new day.

892
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,880
Gamers, let's go.

893
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,860
One, two, three, get sloppy.

894
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,660
Get sloppy.

895
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,620
And we are open for business.

896
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,880
Guys, is the kitchen still the same as it was yesterday?

897
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,460
Yeah, it is.

898
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,480
Alright, my job is to flip, but don't put all the...

899
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,420
Don't put all of them on here.

900
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,520
I'll take orders.

901
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,060
Guys, I don't think we have any power to the building.

902
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,620
They're coming in for their 9.42 AM burgers.

903
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,160
Okay, okay, I'm looking, I'm looking.

904
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:53,740
America!

905
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,280
Hello, welcome.

906
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,200
I'm flipping, I'm flipping with love.

907
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,940
They would want one... Okay, we need two burgers, stat, stat, right now, right now.

908
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,480
Two hamburgers required.

909
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,120
Two burgers, two burgers.

910
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,700
Give them to me, I'll deliver the snacks.

911
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,900
If you do great, daddy will reward you with french fries.

912
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,060
There's an extra burger there.

913
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,880
There's a whole other grill right here.

914
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,540
Yeah, there's another grill.

915
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,940
Okay, this is good enough, this is good enough.

916
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,980
It's raw, it's raw, don't serve it, don't serve it, no!

917
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,000
Can you put the other side back on?

918
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,060
This burger is looking a little bit red.

919
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:37,540
It's not even medium rare, it's actually rare, what are you doing?

920
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,640
Oh there's people!

921
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,060
There's people who are hungry, there's people who are hungry.

922
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,680
It's beef, they don't care if it's raw.

923
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,220
Yes they do!

924
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,500
We lost our happiness meter!

925
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,380
Yeah, I think even if they're hungry, they don't want the raw burgies.

926
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,320
Okay, okay, I got good burgers, I got good patties.

927
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,080
Let's make some burgers.

928
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,620
You left half a fucking burger behind me, don't you dare come near my burgers.

929
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,640
Okay, okay, I'm taking the orders.

930
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,320
You guys, there's five people, there's ten people coming here.

931
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,160
Who will make the best burger?

932
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,880
I know it's not me, that's for sure.

933
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,900
That's for fucking sure.

934
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,220
Did you get trays out please?

935
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,140
Who is this one?

936
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,200
This guy over here, this guy right here.

937
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,320
This guy over here, here you go, burgery.

938
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,920
Did he just squeal like a pig?

939
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,640
Two burgers?

940
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,860
You have one bun.

941
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,300
Oh, hello, give me one moment.

942
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,520
We have a complicated order now team, it's hamburger.

943
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,280
Oh, two hamburgers!

944
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,260
I have three patties here!

945
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,460
Two patties, two patties!

946
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,120
That's a single patty.

947
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,860
This is a single patty, okay, I'll take it in, I'll take it over.

948
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,100
Jesus Christ!

949
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,320
Wait, I don't know who ordered what.

950
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,160
What happened?

951
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,360
Okay, this person liked it, so I think I got the order right.

952
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,140
Okay.

953
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,380
This is another single burger, man, I'm gonna just shove it right there for you.

954
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,820
I got more patties, patties coming right up!

955
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,460
You got a single.

956
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,460
The double burger.

957
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,440
Who are you?

958
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,200
The double burger.

959
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,520
You didn't get a single, you got a single.

960
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,480
Okay, he's happy.

961
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,320
Oh, that's the double?

962
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,640
Go give it to him then.

963
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,740
The doubler.

964
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,860
A doubler, a doubler.

965
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,380
The doubler?

966
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,040
Single lady.

967
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:23,980
The doubler?

968
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,120
Okay, we got the doubler.

969
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:25,780
Thank you.

970
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,760
Oh, and there is one more hamburger.

971
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,720
One more hamburger.

972
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,960
Regular hamburger.

973
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,780
Oh, we need...

974
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:34,760
Hello?

975
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:35,720
Hello?

976
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,500
Guys, I don't think I like working in a burger place anymore.

977
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:40,860
A single hamburger.

978
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,080
There's a single hamburger.

979
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,180
You wanted to play this, don't you?

980
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,600
Yeah, this was your idea.

981
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,320
I wanted to know what it's like, and now I'm like...

982
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,520
Hey, maybe it's not great being a minimum wage worker.

983
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,320
Guys, there's too many people, I can't keep track of what they're getting.

984
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,940
I don't know how to keep track of what they're having.

985
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:01,980
I don't know.

986
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,180
We need to know how to keep track.

987
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,080
That's your job, that's your only job.

988
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,200
I

989
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:09,930
don't...

990
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:10,550
What is this?

991
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,550
What is this?

992
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:12,970
It's a burger.

993
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,570
It says over here, if you look over here, it says which tables there are.

994
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,470
Wait, what did you just hand me?

995
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,070
Is this double?

996
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,070
I don't know, that was a single burger.

997
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:22,910
Oh, single burger.

998
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,230
We're only serving burgers.

999
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,970
But there's double burgers!

1000
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,370
I can't get to the screen.

1001
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,850
They all just say hamburger, they don't say if it's a double burger, single burger.

1002
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:35,850
I don't know.

1003
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,150
Yes it does, you can tell.

1004
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,670
I'm going to buy more burger wrappers than that.

1005
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,470
You can't tell!

1006
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,890
Just look at them!

1007
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,330
You can't tell.

1008
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:46,050
Just look at them and be like, oh you ordered the single burger.

1009
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,310
They have faces!

1010
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,790
They have clothes!

1011
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,150
You ordered...

1012
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,450
Oh no, this guy ordered a double and now he's angry!

1013
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,330
He literally walked out in disgust.

1014
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,790
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1015
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,690
I fucked up, I ordered so much food.

1016
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,010
I'm fumbling, I'm fumbling.

1017
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,270
You don't even want ketchup or anything.

1018
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,670
These people are just standing there.

1019
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,650
We haven't unlocked ketchup, that's advanced burger making.

1020
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:08,810
Who did you get?

1021
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:09,430
What did you get?

1022
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,810
Everybody wants doubles now.

1023
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,090
No more single burgers!

1024
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,530
No more single burgers!

1025
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,550
Just keep it there, hold it.

1026
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,830
They don't know if it's made two hours ago.

1027
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:21,530
They can't tell.

1028
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,450
We can microwave it.

1029
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,610
We'll just microwave it to heat it up a little.

1030
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,790
This restaurant is going to be great, guys.

1031
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,270
We're going to do so well.

1032
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,110
I have more patties.

1033
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,190
It's not going anywhere.

1034
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:42,330
I had a look and the only thing that unlocks at level 10 looked like it was french fries.

1035
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,130
Guys, I have too many patties.

1036
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,230
I need somebody to take this patty.

1037
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:46,890
Okay.

1038
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,290
Hello.

1039
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,970
Okay, this is a single room.

1040
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,270
I think I got this guy.

1041
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,770
Wait, what is live chat?

1042
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,510
I'm getting stuff off the fucking truck.

1043
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,670
Don't you start pushing me.

1044
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,750
Don't you start.

1045
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,670
I'm taking all the tips.

1046
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,770
I'm getting stuff off the fucking kitchen.

1047
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,590
I'm doing the best.

1048
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,010
I'm getting all the money.

1049
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,350
I'm just pressing a couple of buttons.

1050
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,090
You're doing so much work live.

1051
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,770
You're just pressing a couple of buttons.

1052
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,130
Everybody is tipping me.

1053
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,990
You can be a manager too.

1054
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,110
Oh yeah?

1055
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,890
What if I don't want to be a manager?

1056
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,710
What if I don't enjoy fucking the fucking burgers?

1057
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:23,930
The girls are fighting.

1058
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,090
Wait, why are you upset?

1059
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,870
What did I do to you?

1060
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,170
Sir, sir, sir.

1061
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:29,910
Sir, please.

1062
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,690
Sir, don't leave.

1063
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,290
What did you do?

1064
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,410
I don't know.

1065
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,910
What happened to you?

1066
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,570
Can I get a burger?

1067
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,390
Oh, double burger?

1068
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,290
I can give him the sloppy specialty.

1069
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,970
I think we took too long.

1070
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,670
Oh, no more doubles.

1071
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:50,590
Only singles.

1072
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,610
Back to hamburgers.

1073
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:57,110
The only person that's actually doing their job is Snuffy at this point.

1074
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,510
What do you mean?

1075
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,330
I just got everything off the truck.

1076
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:04,910
I'm doing my job.

1077
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:05,470
What are you talking about?

1078
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,650
How do you think we are getting these orders?

1079
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,010
We leveled up because of me.

1080
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,010
We just leveled up because of me.

1081
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,730
Bring the order to the customers.

1082
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:16,810
What a hard job.

1083
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,530
I'm taking the orders too.

1084
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:19,710
What are you talking about?

1085
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:21,790
What are you doing?

1086
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:25,770
Oh my god.

1087
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:26,610
The Krusty Krab.

1088
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:27,770
Wait, what is this?

1089
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,110
A single?

1090
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:29,910
Single, single, single.

1091
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,150
Single sloppy.

1092
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,330
Did you get a food?

1093
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:34,650
No.

1094
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,070
A real bear experience.

1095
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:39,870
I was just gonna say we are really making bear now.

1096
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,430
I got you a single sloppy.

1097
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,270
Sorry, sorry.

1098
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,010
I can't put it down.

1099
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:44,330
Stop.

1100
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,290
Here is your single sloppy.

1101
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,450
I put it on the table.

1102
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,830
I think we are good actually.

1103
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,290
Oh well, OK.

1104
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:54,970
We have no orders.

1105
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:55,490
Oh, hold on.

1106
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:55,490
What?

1107
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,090
Single sloppy.

1108
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:58,990
Single sloppy.

1109
00:44:59,210 --> 00:44:59,870
It's on the tray.

1110
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:00,690
Get it on the tray.

1111
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:01,550
Yeah, I'm going.

1112
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,470
Sometimes their friends spawn out of nowhere.

1113
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:07,970
So it's really scary.

1114
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:12,010
They end up eating a burger in front of their friend with no food.

1115
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,130
Is this a single right here?

1116
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:18,670
Burger.

1117
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:19,950
One burger.

1118
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,230
I make one burger.

1119
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:22,190
No, no, no.

1120
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:22,310
Wait.

1121
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:23,030
Is this a single?

1122
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,170
Is this a single right here?

1123
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:24,710
It's a single.

1124
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,410
Yeah, it's a single.

1125
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:26,990
I'm serving.

1126
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,790
I have four more patties left.

1127
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,510
And then it should be fine, right?

1128
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:31,770
Guys, we are not...

1129
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,630
Get your feet off the counters.

1130
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:34,330
What are you doing?

1131
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,010
Oh God, I'm terrified.

1132
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,170
I'm sanitized.

1133
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:37,470
This is another guy.

1134
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,370
He wants a single.

1135
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,310
What the hell is that?

1136
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:39,890
What are you doing?

1137
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,390
There is a single on the thing.

1138
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,110
I found a milk frother.

1139
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,650
How would we have...

1140
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:45,990
Get out.

1141
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,010
I need to flip burgers.

1142
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:48,670
Ew.

1143
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:49,830
What is happening?

1144
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:49,970
Dang.

1145
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:54,370
What the fuck is happening over there?

1146
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:55,150
It's throwing up.

1147
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,050
Wait, they're throwing up?

1148
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,350
What did you serve them?

1149
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,930
No, it's the sound of the burger frothing.

1150
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:06,030
I don't think we need to put eight burgers on the thing anymore.

1151
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:07,030
It's like 9pm.

1152
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:07,990
What do you think we're closing?

1153
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,850
Do you think there'll be rats in here?

1154
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:12,650
By tomorrow?

1155
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:13,390
Oh, probably.

1156
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,150
By tomorrow, Debi.

1157
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:16,790
There's probably rats already.

1158
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:17,630
It's fine.

1159
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,530
We'll put the tray in the fridge.

1160
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:21,150
In the freezer.

1161
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:23,610
And then we'll put it in the microwave after.

1162
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:26,830
How would they know?

1163
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:27,610
How would they know?

1164
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,430
How would they know?

1165
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:29,870
How would they know?

1166
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,810
Like, the health inspector's just gonna come in and then close this down?

1167
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:34,810
They never do that.

1168
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,370
Yeah, exactly.

1169
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,010
I wish they did.

1170
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:41,850
Sir, are you done with that?

1171
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:42,690
Okay, thank you.

1172
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,630
Are you done?

1173
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,330
I need to take it.

1174
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:45,910
Please, sir.

1175
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,530
Sir, we're closed.

1176
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:48,770
We're closed.

1177
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:50,430
It's not as good as you think it is.

1178
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,430
You cannot just, like, toss the fucking boxes in this game.

1179
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:54,190
Hey, you took my tip!

1180
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:56,450
You took my tip!

1181
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:57,130
Yeah, you did!

1182
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,390
No, I didn't.

1183
00:46:58,410 --> 00:46:59,450
Well, I took the other one.

1184
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,270
I've been working this entire floor.

1185
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,070
Oh my god, the day is over.

1186
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,110
Thank god.

1187
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,350
Hey, we still need to clean up.

1188
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,450
Get your ass back in here.

1189
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:11,570
What do you mean clean up?

1190
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,070
Everything is already clean!

1191
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,590
Oh, there's voice chat.

1192
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:15,890
Wait, there is?

1193
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,390
You think they'll like you if we put ketchup on their burger?

1194
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:21,810
Nah.

1195
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,590
No, they don't ask for ketchup on their burger.

1196
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,390
They're plain Janes.

1197
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:25,110
They don't want anything.

1198
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:27,650
They hate fun.

1199
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:28,890
They hate fun?

1200
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,610
Let's clean up this.

1201
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,950
I'm cleaning up these boxes.

1202
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:35,670
So we can actually do some more stuff.

1203
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,450
Oh, we get ice cream cups at level 5!

1204
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,350
Oh my god!

1205
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,870
And the ice cream machine won't be breaking!

1206
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,090
No, please, god, no.

1207
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:42,030
I'm not ready for this.

1208
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:42,970
Let's get out of the dang restaurant.

1209
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:46,510
My wife is... Our favorite show is about to happen.

1210
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:47,530
I'm cleaning up!

1211
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,190
There's trash everywhere!

1212
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,730
There's trash everywhere!

1213
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,390
You guys, we get experience.

1214
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,830
Don't you want level 4 ice cream?

1215
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,750
You gotta clean up to get the experience.

1216
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,530
We'll clean up tomorrow.

1217
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:03,910
Yeah, actually.

1218
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:07,210
I'm throwing stuff away and it actually works.

1219
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:11,290
Wait, does it like level us up for doing that?

1220
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,330
Yeah, actually.

1221
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:13,410
Wait, it does?

1222
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:13,910
Yeah.

1223
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:17,030
Oh, guys, we actually... No, we lost $7.

1224
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:18,550
Never mind.

1225
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,970
So cleaning up is a scam and we should let it all rot.

1226
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,050
How are we losing money?

1227
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,270
I don't understand.

1228
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:30,250
Do you think the patrons can see us having a party on the tables?

1229
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,250
Yeah, they'll be like, let's go!

1230
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,530
This place, they're crazy in there.

1231
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,950
Oh my god, we should head over there tomorrow.

1232
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,230
Seems like the workers are having a lot of fun.

1233
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:40,990
Oh, come on.

1234
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,190
Wait, what's our restaurant name?

1235
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,210
Did we ever make one?

1236
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,890
Oh, Sloppy's!

1237
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:47,510
That's why we call you Sloppy's!

1238
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,650
You think we're just saying Sloppy's for fun?

1239
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,370
It's a very serious name.

1240
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,770
Yeah, I thought so.

1241
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,210
The Sloppy's fast food chain.

1242
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:58,510
It's like the next up and cover.

1243
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:00,710
Burger King, watch out.

1244
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:02,350
Yeah, watch out.

1245
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,350
You won't be king no longer.

1246
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:07,650
Okay, sorry.

1247
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,230
Let's leave.

1248
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,890
Alright, I'm ready.

1249
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,510
I'm ready to start another day.

1250
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,170
I love working at Sloppy's.

1251
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,830
I love Sloppy's!

1252
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:18,670
I love Sloppy's!

1253
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,030
Sloppy's!

1254
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:19,350
Sloppy's!

1255
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:19,910
Sloppy's!

1256
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:27,690
See, we even carpool.

1257
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,270
We're so... Oh my god, I pressed my watch.

1258
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,310
We got a barrel of gasoline!

1259
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,630
We did it!

1260
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,330
I love Sloppy's!

1261
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:43,710
What are we gonna do with gas?

1262
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,190
Welcome Sloppy's!

1263
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:48,110
Another lovely day working at the Sloppy's.

1264
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,170
What's a Sloppy's fan called?

1265
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:51,750
Like a Sloppy guy?

1266
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,410
I opened it immediately because we don't need that prep time.

1267
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:54,890
A Slopper?

1268
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:56,410
That's alright.

1269
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,210
The patties are gone!

1270
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,250
The burgies!

1271
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:02,650
What happened to the patties?

1272
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,110
The rats ate them!

1273
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:04,970
We told you!

1274
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,510
Oh my god!

1275
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,110
So we can't pre-serve patties.

1276
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,710
I can't believe it.

1277
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,230
We do have a rat problem.

1278
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:14,470
We have a rat problem.

1279
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:15,950
Customers!

1280
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:16,530
Inbound!

1281
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:18,330
Everybody take your positions!

1282
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,330
I'm organizing my tops and bottoms.

1283
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,630
It's important to get it right.

1284
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:23,150
Guys, we have ketchup now!

1285
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:24,710
We have ketchup now!

1286
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:25,210
We have ketchup!

1287
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:26,850
Please check the orders!

1288
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:27,830
Please check the orders!

1289
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,790
It's time to do ketchup!

1290
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:29,810
I need to order ketchup!

1291
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:30,410
Hold on!

1292
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:31,870
We have ketchup!

1293
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:32,470
We have ketchup!

1294
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:32,990
It's right here!

1295
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,970
They are empty!

1296
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:36,810
It says fullness 0-15!

1297
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,210
I got to order ketchup.

1298
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,710
I order ketchup and more burgies.

1299
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,590
We order tomato.

1300
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,750
Why is ketchup so fucking expensive?

1301
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:47,490
Holy shit!

1302
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:48,930
Alright, there we go.

1303
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:49,270
It's fine.

1304
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:50,730
We made a profit yesterday.

1305
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:53,650
That guy spent $21.

1306
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:54,190
Where are the burgers?

1307
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:55,890
I'm flipping!

1308
00:50:58,330 --> 00:50:59,570
Let's swap roles.

1309
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:00,730
You do the flipping.

1310
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,410
I haven't even ketchup yet.

1311
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:03,190
Let me ketchup.

1312
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:07,970
Do not put the tops on separate wraps.

1313
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,010
That's a top!

1314
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,850
Do not mix your tops and your bottoms!

1315
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,290
Our order is here!

1316
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:15,470
Stop it!

1317
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:16,470
Stop!

1318
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:17,110
Stop!

1319
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:18,990
This is too real.

1320
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:21,450
I don't think we are playing a game anymore.

1321
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:22,910
I know.

1322
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,410
This feels too real.

1323
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,970
I don't like it anymore, please.

1324
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:30,170
I know I worked Wendy's.

1325
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,690
I don't want to do it again.

1326
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:33,970
I thought we were supposed to be scared.

1327
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:38,410
What are we ordering?

1328
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:39,370
We got a burger?

1329
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,710
I have the ketchup everybody!

1330
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,750
Ketchup is here.

1331
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,910
I just put it in here.

1332
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:45,410
There you go.

1333
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,170
OK, I'll fill the ketchup up.

1334
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:48,030
Ketchup?

1335
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,610
What happened to the order?

1336
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,970
Nobody wants ketchup anymore.

1337
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,870
There is a ketchup person now.

1338
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:55,590
They probably left because they were really upset.

1339
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,030
Ketchup, but we didn't ketchup it.

1340
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,450
There is no ketchup on the burger.

1341
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,070
There are people that don't want ketchup.

1342
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:00,550
OK, single?

1343
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,390
This is single no ketchup.

1344
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:03,210
Single no ketchup.

1345
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,770
Which one is the single no ketchup?

1346
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:08,090
This one?

1347
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,290
This one is the single no ketchup.

1348
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:12,730
Table number one.

1349
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,830
And then I put a smiley face and then I wrap it with love.

1350
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:17,450
See?

1351
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:18,330
There we go!

1352
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,430
I made a burger with ketchup.

1353
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,170
What is this one?

1354
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:21,830
The one I just grabbed.

1355
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,110
This is the Krusty Burger.

1356
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:24,790
Krabby Patty.

1357
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,210
No, it's not.

1358
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,090
Double 16.

1359
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,770
I literally wrapped it with love.

1360
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:30,490
16, 16, 16.

1361
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,090
It's six.

1362
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:32,490
OK.

1363
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:37,570
This person wants three fucking squirts of ketchup on their burger.

1364
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:38,110
Hold on.

1365
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:39,190
I know.

1366
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:44,150
I'm putting as many burgers as possible, man.

1367
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:45,090
More ketchup!

1368
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:46,730
More ketchup!

1369
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:47,610
What's this one?

1370
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:50,290
Wait, wait, wait.

1371
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:51,710
This is for science.

1372
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:53,110
This is for science.

1373
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:53,830
This is for science.

1374
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:54,590
Hello?

1375
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:55,510
Oh, hello.

1376
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,890
This guy wants a single patty and three single...

1377
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:03,090
Do you think anyone wants a burger with 18 dollops of ketchup on it?

1378
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,050
I would.

1379
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,230
What's wrong with that?

1380
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,910
What the fuck is wrong with that?

1381
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,690
There's not even a meat on there.

1382
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,550
Wow, it's so thick.

1383
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:16,430
Yeah, it's so thick.

1384
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,210
It's like literally the entire bun.

1385
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,610
This is really bringing back playing Disney Channel.

1386
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,750
Guys, we still have customers.

1387
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:27,490
My God, it doesn't look like that.

1388
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:28,830
What are these right here?

1389
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:29,850
What is this wrapped bun?

1390
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:31,510
Which one?

1391
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:32,250
This one.

1392
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:35,370
This one is ketchup with three squirts of...

1393
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:37,250
Sorry, three squirts of ketchup with a burger.

1394
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,990
Which table is that?

1395
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:43,230
Take it to table 7.

1396
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,330
Table 7?

1397
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:45,750
OK.

1398
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:47,290
I'm gonna take this to 5.

1399
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,110
I'm gonna risk it.

1400
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:49,490
Here you go, table 7.

1401
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,690
I'll have your burger then.

1402
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:53,730
What the fuck did I do wrong?

1403
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,610
I don't think they wanted three squirts.

1404
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:57,390
No, it was!

1405
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,550
It was three squirts!

1406
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:00,670
It was three squirts!

1407
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:03,610
You're three squirts!

1408
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:08,970
OK, you need to stop talking, Doki, and keep flipping.

1409
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:10,830
I am flipping!

1410
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:11,650
I'm flipping!

1411
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,830
Look, I made three patties.

1412
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:19,170
I don't know about you guys, but I'm doing my job well.

1413
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,510
We have so many customers, you guys.

1414
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:23,370
This is a hamburger with two squirts mint.

1415
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,490
Two squirt.

1416
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,670
I don't know what this is.

1417
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:26,630
I don't know what the fuck this is.

1418
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:28,230
This is the two squirter.

1419
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:28,830
OK.

1420
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,970
I can't put it... These are the wrong trays!

1421
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,590
Why are you putting the wrong trays on my counter?

1422
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,570
The two squirter is table number 6.

1423
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,330
How many squirts was it again?

1424
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:47,810
It was a double squirter!

1425
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,090
Table number 9 is gonna get it.

1426
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,610
We can buy soda cups!

1427
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,670
We can now have a functioning soda system.

1428
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,990
OK, one squirt with a hamburger.

1429
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:08,930
I swear to God, if this is wrong...

1430
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,970
If this is wrong, then they are bullshit.

1431
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:12,570
One squirt.

1432
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:17,770
OK, this is a single squirt hamburger mint.

1433
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:18,570
OK, thank you.

1434
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,030
Single squirt hamburger.

1435
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:21,730
I need more meat.

1436
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:24,870
There should be some more in the freezer.

1437
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,370
Table 15.

1438
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:27,750
Single squirt.

1439
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:31,710
Wait, where are my damn cups?

1440
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,550
Hey, where are my cups?

1441
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:36,650
What the hell?

1442
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,290
Where are my cups at?

1443
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:42,510
You scammed us.

1444
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,250
Are you sure you ordered cups, Snoopy?

1445
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,010
I know sometimes, you know...

1446
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:46,770
I think I did.

1447
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,670
Did you serve the single squirt mint?

1448
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:50,510
Yeah, I did.

1449
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,230
OK, I'm making another single squirt.

1450
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,550
You guys, anyone that we don't know what it is, I'm gonna put it in there.

1451
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:58,570
Single squirt.

1452
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,090
Are you putting burgers in the cupboard?

1453
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,670
I don't know what it is!

1454
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,650
Then why don't we swap jobs?

1455
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:13,310
Someone just put a hamburger there.

1456
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,330
I didn't know what it was.

1457
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:17,010
I think thinking too much isn't your strong suit today.

1458
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,950
No, I've been delivering.

1459
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,510
You have a burger.

1460
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:21,490
This is table 2.

1461
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,270
Table 2, thanks.

1462
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,270
I will see the tables instead of the burgers.

1463
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:31,690
Wait, it tells you exactly what they're ordering right here.

1464
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,170
You're just...

1465
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,130
OK, this is not my job.

1466
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,910
Mint, this is table 13.

1467
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:42,830
Thank you.

1468
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,110
You're welcome.

1469
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:45,370
Table 13.

1470
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,230
I need more wrappers.

1471
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:48,590
Where do we have wrappers?

1472
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:49,290
They're probably not in the fridge.

1473
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:51,270
There is no one at table 13.

1474
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:53,690
Guys, I got a load of cups.

1475
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,970
I threw it away.

1476
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,730
Table... do they have any squirts on it, chat?

1477
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:02,790
I can't remember.

1478
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:06,050
I've got some...

1479
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:08,850
I'm making a burger for table 8.

1480
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:09,850
OK, table 8.

1481
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:13,950
I have some more patties.

1482
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:16,790
Soda's live, baby.

1483
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:18,690
Table 8.

1484
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:23,110
Table 8 just left.

1485
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,050
Give it to table 11.

1486
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:27,730
Give it to table 11.

1487
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:31,610
Guys, I overmade some patties again.

1488
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:32,530
I didn't know.

1489
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:35,190
This is table 12.

1490
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:38,870
If we serve faster, we might be able to serve all these...

1491
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:40,670
I'm working!

1492
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:41,310
I'm working!

1493
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:42,590
Table 12.

1494
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,290
Order up!

1495
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,330
Table 14.

1496
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,870
You can do something that doesn't involve standing there.

1497
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,690
Who are you talking to?

1498
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:58,970
I don't even know.

1499
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:04,270
Double burger.

1500
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:05,710
Double burger.

1501
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:08,090
All patties are done.

1502
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:09,510
We don't want to waste inventory.

1503
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:11,090
Table 4.

1504
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:13,930
Guys, we are a good team.

1505
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:17,110
We have table 4 left.

1506
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,130
Table 4 is done.

1507
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,470
We have another customer.

1508
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:23,790
We have another customer.

1509
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:25,850
What do they want?

1510
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:26,930
Hamburger?

1511
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:32,910
I'm going to clean up here.

1512
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,030
Fuck, fuck, bitch, fuck, shit.

1513
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:39,350
That's dumb.

1514
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:39,970
I hate that one.

1515
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:40,870
That one is dumb.

1516
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,670
I didn't like it anyway.

1517
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,150
I'm going to put this into the freezer.

1518
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:45,950
No, I'm getting tips.

1519
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:46,690
Don't worry.

1520
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:48,310
Sometimes.

1521
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:49,350
Are you sharing with the class?

1522
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:50,090
Table 9.

1523
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,330
Oh shit, I put the patties in the freezer.

1524
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:57,190
I wasn't sure we had more orders.

1525
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,150
I think we are good.

1526
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,350
I think we are done.

1527
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,170
That was the last one.

1528
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,390
I'm hoarding all the tips.

1529
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:10,130
I'm going to put this in the fridge and see if that keeps it again.

1530
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,730
Can I just toss stuff in the fucking trash?

1531
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:15,130
Hold on.

1532
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,450
Wait, we are actually making profit!

1533
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:22,030
I got an achievement for throwing shit away.

1534
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:23,230
Yeah, you do.

1535
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,550
I've thrown a lot of burgers away.

1536
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,690
Come on, eat your burger.

1537
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:28,730
Eat your burger.

1538
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:29,490
Come on.

1539
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:32,030
You scared me.

1540
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:33,130
I thought you were like...

1541
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:37,210
I thought you were like... What's that guy from It?

1542
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:42,090
I love how someone is with them and they just awkwardly stare at them the entire time.

1543
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:43,230
Come on, I want my tip.

1544
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,170
I worked so hard flipping on the grill.

1545
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:48,270
There were two tips that you just ignored right behind you.

1546
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:49,090
Wait, what?

1547
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:50,570
Are they on the table?

1548
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:53,710
I know these guys are going to tip so much.

1549
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:56,090
I know it.

1550
00:59:57,690 --> 00:59:58,970
Wait, where did the tip go?

1551
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:04,690
Where did the tip go?

1552
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:13,850
Okay, good job.

1553
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:15,530
Oh wait, you guys, we have bathrooms.

1554
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:16,830
Should we be cleaning these?

1555
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,830
I like your stash, Mint.

1556
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:23,930
Did you stash burgers in there when you don't know what they are?

1557
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:27,570
I didn't know what burger that was.

1558
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:28,390
I didn't know.

1559
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:31,950
Did you stash them when you don't know what the burgers are?

1560
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,290
Is that the plan?

1561
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,750
Yeah, I just kind of... I don't know what to do with them.

1562
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:38,370
My stuff is making soda.

1563
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,530
It's magic soda.

1564
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:42,530
Do you know how to put a lid on it?

1565
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:44,590
Do you think it's supposed to be served just like that?

1566
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:48,130
If you like it, then you better put a lid on it.

1567
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:52,610
Wait, is it getting colder?

1568
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,390
Oh no, it's getting warmer.

1569
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,990
Oh, this actually has temperature.

1570
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,130
You can actually serve warm soda on it.

1571
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:05,750
Yeah, it's literally getting warmer.

1572
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:08,910
Okay kids, dad's going home.

1573
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:10,670
Carpool time, everybody!

1574
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,510
I'm coming, dad!

1575
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:12,830
I'm coming!

1576
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:16,390
I like how there's a tray that's permanently highlighted underneath the desk there.

1577
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:17,510
I don't know if anyone else sees it.

1578
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:18,550
Wait, I don't see it.

1579
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:20,750
I think that's a manager thing.

1580
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:21,850
Yeah, it might be you.

1581
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,030
Let's go!

1582
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:29,710
Did we make money, dad?

1583
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,150
We did it!

1584
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:37,390
I'm starting to think we're not very efficient with our food purchasing.

1585
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:39,070
No, no, no, no.

1586
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:41,190
We did it, guys!

1587
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:44,030
We can make soda now!

1588
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:44,670
Sloppy!

1589
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,030
It's a sloppy day.

1590
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:51,410
When you start a restaurant, you take a loss and then you start making a profit.

1591
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:56,010
Maybe we grill a little bit first so we don't have the first five customers storm away.

1592
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,190
We can almost sell a combo meal.

1593
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:00,810
We'll just grill slightly first.

1594
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:04,750
It's already on.

1595
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:06,750
Wait, wait, wait.

1596
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:07,950
Who turned the business on?

1597
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:09,910
I didn't.

1598
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,430
I'm ready for customers.

1599
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,530
I'm ready for customers.

1600
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:19,390
I'm double dashing.

1601
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:21,590
I don't know.

1602
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,570
I think it's for fries.

1603
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,090
Customers inbound!

1604
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,650
We have two people already!

1605
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:33,010
I need a burger tray for the burger flipper!

1606
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,470
I'm taking inventory.

1607
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,430
We have a drink!

1608
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:38,750
Our first drink order!

1609
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:40,530
Just a drink?

1610
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:43,070
Wait, what do they want?

1611
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:44,470
Splash cola.

1612
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:49,390
I'm putting more patties in.

1613
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:51,730
The burger flipper is doing the burger flipping.

1614
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:55,250
Is it almost ready?

1615
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,150
We have two burgers already we need.

1616
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:58,430
How do I get the lid?

1617
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:01,190
Miss Manager, when do we get our promotions?

1618
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,070
Guys, we don't have any money.

1619
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:09,130
We can't buy any more burgers.

1620
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:10,790
We have $700.

1621
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:12,390
You're just not allowed to buy anything.

1622
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,810
I bought stuff before.

1623
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,310
Is it players you mean?

1624
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:21,210
The top rate is the cost, not the money we have.

1625
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:24,970
What's the one under it then?

1626
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:25,850
I'm gonna let you wait first.

1627
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:29,450
Guys, I don't think we are learning.

1628
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,830
Table 11!

1629
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:34,590
I got patties!

1630
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:36,190
Patties here!

1631
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:37,670
Table 11!

1632
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:41,890
This is for table 6 to go with the cola.

1633
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:43,710
We leveled up!

1634
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:47,050
Table 6 to go with the cola!

1635
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,110
Time to get lettuce!

1636
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:53,410
This is for table 2.

1637
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:55,030
Table 2!

1638
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,230
Table 2!

1639
01:03:58,930 --> 01:03:59,750
You can take them.

1640
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:03,790
Table is on the table!

1641
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:06,070
Table is on the table!

1642
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:08,990
We are losing our minds!

1643
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:12,950
That's my job!

1644
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:16,690
They have no other purpose but to flip patties.

1645
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:22,370
This is for table 1 but they need a cola.

1646
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:23,970
They have a cola!

1647
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:28,470
Where are my wrappers?

1648
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,170
I need my wrappers.

1649
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:32,890
I don't think we have wrappers anymore.

1650
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,410
One moment ma'am.

1651
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:38,310
We do not need to buy more wrappers, Nuffy.

1652
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:44,270
I bought lettuce.

1653
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,110
I'm building more patties!

1654
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:50,650
We're gonna be able to advertise ourselves as vegan!

1655
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:51,790
Table 12!

1656
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:52,950
Thank you.

1657
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:56,190
Table 12.

1658
01:04:56,890 --> 01:04:57,790
Oh no!

1659
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,290
I think I did the wrong thing.

1660
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:01,170
Oh dear.

1661
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:02,650
That's what she wanted though!

1662
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:03,730
That's what she wanted!

1663
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:05,690
Regular.

1664
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:12,390
It makes the burgers a little healthier!

1665
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:16,430
Table 16!

1666
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:17,530
Table 16!

1667
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:18,370
Thank you!

1668
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:20,810
What's table 16 got?

1669
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:28,750
Alright, I have a lot of patties.

1670
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:31,230
I'm gonna stop grilling because I don't want to waste inventory.

1671
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:33,430
We got people coming!

1672
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:34,930
People are inbound!

1673
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:38,790
Did you serve that burger?

1674
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:40,090
To who?

1675
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:43,250
That burger had Listeria in it.

1676
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,130
This is for table 3.

1677
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:48,650
Table 3!

1678
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:51,190
They also need a drink though.

1679
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:55,910
I'm getting the patty in.

1680
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:57,130
I can't read these.

1681
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:00,870
Table 5!

1682
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,430
We're a well working machine now!

1683
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:05,570
Look at us go!

1684
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,530
I'm so proud of us!

1685
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,710
Table 10.

1686
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:12,670
What do we do with the lettuce?

1687
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:14,790
How do we make lettuce?

1688
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:15,610
Hold on!

1689
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:18,130
How do we make lettuce happen?

1690
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:21,530
Table 10!

1691
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,750
Hold on, I'm still on table 5!

1692
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,410
You know what to do now.

1693
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:31,150
Table 5.

1694
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:32,750
Shred it.

1695
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:37,390
I think Mint might need some help with the drinks and stuff up front.

1696
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:38,990
I need help with the drinks!

1697
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:41,010
You'll be fine!

1698
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,990
They just want water!

1699
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:48,070
You can get that yourself!

1700
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:50,810
Ok, ok, ok, I'll help you.

1701
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:52,950
She just told the customer to get their own food.

1702
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:56,310
Why is the drink even on our side?

1703
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:56,670
Hold on!

1704
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:58,230
I know, right?

1705
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:00,850
Table 17!

1706
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:04,610
I think they walked out!

1707
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:07,590
They walked out!

1708
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:12,650
No, the people that wanted the water.

1709
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:15,170
Ok, table 4.

1710
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:17,150
What do I do?

1711
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:22,130
Table 17!

1712
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:23,750
Table 17!

1713
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:27,750
Help Mint, she's having a mental breakdown.

1714
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:29,190
Mint, what do you need?

1715
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:33,910
Mint, what do you need?

1716
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:34,590
Say something!

1717
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:35,950
We're here to help you!

1718
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:38,530
This is to table...

1719
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:39,530
17.

1720
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:41,310
Take it to table 17.

1721
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:42,950
We're 17.

1722
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:45,270
Oh, it's over there.

1723
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:45,470
Ok.

1724
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:50,010
I'm here to serve you because our waiter is incompetent.

1725
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:52,150
You...

1726
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:56,290
What have you been doing this whole time besides flipping burgers?

1727
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:57,210
I've been taking orders.

1728
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:58,110
I've been delivering orders.

1729
01:07:58,290 --> 01:07:59,230
I've been clearing tables.

1730
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:01,350
I've been... I keep this...

1731
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:03,230
What is this one?

1732
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:04,690
What is this burger right here?

1733
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,150
What is this one?

1734
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:13,470
Do you think table 10 is going to stay long enough for me to serve them?

1735
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:14,170
Hello?

1736
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:20,190
Table 10 has been waiting here for an hour for a burger.

1737
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:21,450
Did you see that?

1738
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:22,370
Did you see that?

1739
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:23,950
Table 10.

1740
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:24,670
Table 10.

1741
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:25,470
That's a burger.

1742
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:26,710
Take it to table 10.

1743
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:28,970
I'm almost out of cups by the way.

1744
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:30,070
Oh no, I did it wrong.

1745
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:31,330
There are cups to your right.

1746
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:33,110
There are actual cups to your right side.

1747
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,010
There are 10 here.

1748
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:35,550
Ok, bring them over here.

1749
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:37,230
Wait, which is this burger for?

1750
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:37,830
Table 10?

1751
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:38,910
Table 10.

1752
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:39,330
Table 10.

1753
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:42,490
Uh, table 7.

1754
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:43,970
I'll bring it over.

1755
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:45,570
I'll bring it over to table 10.

1756
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:47,750
Table 7, splash cola.

1757
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:51,370
Oh nice!

1758
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:56,670
You need to go to the cooler to cool off.

1759
01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:00,210
Yeah, I'm going to go cry in there real quick.

1760
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:07,130
I've heard actually that crying in the walk-in freezer is like a rite of passage.

1761
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:08,750
It is actually though.

1762
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:11,010
Oh, 7!

1763
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:12,530
Wait, why did you leave?

1764
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:14,730
Ok, table 7 left.

1765
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:21,890
Because you've been here for 2 and a half hours for a burger.

1766
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,410
Look, I finished making all my burgers.

1767
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:28,050
This lady just wants a Yoma.

1768
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:29,050
What the hell?

1769
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:30,750
What the fuck is a Yoma?

1770
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:31,830
It's like soda.

1771
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:33,670
Table 4!

1772
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,410
Hey guys, we have an issue.

1773
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:38,670
We need more patties.

1774
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:45,510
We have one more box.

1775
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:48,010
Oh wait, can you put that to the fridge next to me?

1776
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:52,330
Oh my gosh, I'm out of cups!

1777
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,710
I'm flipping patties, I'm flipping patties.

1778
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:01,070
We don't have patties right now.

1779
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:03,110
Someone take this to table 4, stat!

1780
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:09,050
Oh god, I need to order more patties and more food.

1781
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:10,910
You want more cups?

1782
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:12,810
More cups.

1783
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,030
Ok, I order cups.

1784
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:18,170
Why is it so fucking expensive?

1785
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:20,150
Ok, I'll clear some tables since we're...

1786
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:27,030
Oh no, now we're wasting more patties because it's 9 and I didn't know it was 9 already!

1787
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:27,910
Donkey!

1788
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:29,610
We're still getting orders.

1789
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:33,910
We have people coming in, we have people coming in.

1790
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,830
What's this random wrapped burger?

1791
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,790
I don't know, it was one that they left.

1792
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:38,850
I'm gonna put it in the sink or something.

1793
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:40,630
No, put it under the cabinet with the rest.

1794
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,710
Put it under the cabinet.

1795
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:44,170
Apologies, it's too late.

1796
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:45,030
It's gone.

1797
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,190
We could've ate that burger!

1798
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:49,710
The stash, the stash!

1799
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:54,650
Ok, I have more patties.

1800
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:55,870
This is table 7.

1801
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:58,090
Table 7!

1802
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:00,430
Just a little bit.

1803
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:01,570
I'm taking this lady's order.

1804
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:02,870
Ok, there we go.

1805
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:04,230
Table 7.

1806
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:05,050
Don't fire me!

1807
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,130
I'm doing my job!

1808
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:08,310
I'm doing the best I can!

1809
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,850
Am I getting fired?

1810
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:14,810
Am I getting fired?

1811
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:18,830
I need this job, please!

1812
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:23,310
Please, I need this job!

1813
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:28,490
What was in table 7?

1814
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:29,650
Oh my God, they just left.

1815
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:31,550
Oh my God, people are walking out, you guys.

1816
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:32,390
Table 11!

1817
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:36,530
Wait, which one is table 11?

1818
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:37,170
Which one?

1819
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:38,930
This one!

1820
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:43,430
I hope your job is considered essential.

1821
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,650
I'm freaking out, Sloth.

1822
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:54,870
I'd like to report that in a week...

1823
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:59,470
In a week of working at the restaurant, we are negative $250.

1824
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:00,810
Good job, everybody.

1825
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:02,690
Somebody is banging on the door.

1826
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:03,190
What?

1827
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:07,550
Somebody is stuck in the freezer.

1828
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:09,970
Is somebody stuck in the freezer?

1829
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:12,950
Are you in the freezer?

1830
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:16,850
Is she going to freeze to death if we leave her in there?

1831
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:18,510
Do you think she'll cool off?

1832
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:19,930
Do you think she needs a minute to cool off?

1833
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:21,370
I was able to leave.

1834
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:22,470
How are you able to leave?

1835
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:25,250
Try going in.

1836
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:26,170
Try going in.

1837
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:27,730
Okay, okay, okay.

1838
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:30,070
Mint's character looks so fucking tired.

1839
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:31,210
Get out of the car!

1840
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:33,610
You look tired.

1841
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:34,290
We're all tired.

1842
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,310
I'm scared inside right now.

1843
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:37,790
Okay, just leave it.

1844
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:38,210
Just leave.

1845
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:40,170
Get me out!

1846
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,410
It's the end of the day.

1847
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:49,550
You'll be living on day 4 for the rest of your life if you don't let me out.

1848
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:52,210
Let me out.

1849
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:55,310
Snuffy's the only one with a wife, I'm pretty sure, so I don't care.

1850
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,370
Let me out.

1851
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:58,890
Please.

1852
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,930
It sounds so pathetic.

1853
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:09,570
That's all I have in my life.

1854
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:12,590
You need to familiarize yourself with the patties.

1855
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:13,530
Your technique is shabby.

1856
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:15,270
There's not even no patties.

1857
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:18,130
There's like no food left in the freezer, guys.

1858
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:20,130
There's nothing left.

1859
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:20,950
There's no life.

1860
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:22,950
There's no reason to live.

1861
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:32,210
I feel like the episode of Spongebob where they have a bunch of the diapers in the wall.

1862
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:35,630
It's the unknowns.

1863
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:36,990
That's what these are.

1864
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,210
They're the unknowns.

1865
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:42,430
Guys, please.

1866
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:48,050
I wanna go home to my family.

1867
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,170
Are you still in the freezer?

1868
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:59,470
I can't even open the door.

1869
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,930
Why are people still ordering food?

1870
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:04,110
What is the fucking chapter in that?

1871
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:06,730
We need it for tomorrow.

1872
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:10,910
We have no patties.

1873
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:17,310
We already lost a hundred dollars.

1874
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:21,330
We gotta make sure we're stocked up for the start tomorrow.

1875
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:26,010
Alright, clock out, gang.

1876
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:27,810
Lock up first.

1877
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:31,850
Oh, soda cup's empty.

1878
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:34,870
I love working here everyday.

1879
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:35,870
You chose this.

1880
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:37,290
You chose this, guys.

1881
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:42,950
Oh, we have freezer patties in this freezer.

1882
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,970
Wait, what about these?

1883
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:48,950
Hold on, there's more patties that can be put in the freezer.

1884
01:14:55,690 --> 01:15:02,810
Imagine how exciting waking up it'll be knowing that tomorrow is the day that we might be able to start serving french fries.

1885
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:04,390
True!

1886
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:05,670
I'm excited.

1887
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:08,050
As a sloppy team member, I'm excited.

1888
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:09,330
I'm excited.

1889
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:10,310
I love sloppies.

1890
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:11,250
I love sloppies.

1891
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:12,610
I love sloppies.

1892
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:24,830
Another sloppy day here at Sloppy's.

1893
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:27,890
Guys, I'm afraid of when we get the drive-thru.

1894
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:29,050
I'm not gonna lie.

1895
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:35,850
I don't think we have enough people for the drive-thru.

1896
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:38,630
We don't have enough people for the drive-thru.

1897
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:40,690
I don't think we have enough people.

1898
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,010
You guys wanna start grilling?

1899
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:47,110
Please let me grill.

1900
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:49,790
Do we have any more cups?

1901
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:50,970
Or is this it?

1902
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:56,730
Yes, you would blow your mind, but open that door and you shall see I have filled your cup dream.

1903
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:59,010
Wow, you really did.

1904
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:01,450
Oh my god, Sloppy is so good.

1905
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:02,750
Maybe she should be the manager.

1906
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:06,450
All in favor of changing manager, say aye.

1907
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:07,430
Aye.

1908
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:07,550
Aye.

1909
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:11,430
I didn't mean to overthrow anybody.

1910
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:13,970
I just love working at Sloppy's.

1911
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:18,450
Snuffy's got the sloppy spirit.

1912
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:21,550
Yeah, she has more sloppy spirit than all of us.

1913
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:23,870
She represents the sloppiest.

1914
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,590
If I'm stocking, I get yelled up for doing nothing.

1915
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:28,290
If I'm doing the burgers, I get yelled up for not being stocking.

1916
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:28,950
Mutiny!

1917
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:31,190
Mutiny at Sloppy's!

1918
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:33,070
Mutiny at Sloppy's!

1919
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:35,330
Then we get the sloppy bonus.

1920
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:36,370
Yeah!

1921
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:39,470
I don't know if I want a sloppy bonus.

1922
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:47,010
All I'm saying is that I think Snuffy represents the sloppy values and she never complained.

1923
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:47,650
I think so.

1924
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:49,790
I don't know if you should be calling Snuffy sloppy.

1925
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:52,470
I'm opening up shop everybody!

1926
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:53,310
Chop chop!

1927
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:55,190
She has the sloppy in.

1928
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:57,070
It's time to be sloppy!

1929
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:58,610
Yeah!

1930
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:02,250
Grab your family so we can all get sloppy together!

1931
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:07,530
I'm honestly a little bit concerned that you think that Sloppy's is a democracy.

1932
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:14,170
I'm just going to throw it out here.

1933
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:17,570
We got our first customer!

1934
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,710
It's the matriarchy.

1935
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:22,030
It's my fucking server!

1936
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:23,850
Wait, did we get Froyo?

1937
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:24,890
What the hell is this?

1938
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:26,290
Froyo?

1939
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:28,570
We unlocked ice cream?

1940
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,650
Do we have purple cups?

1941
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,670
We're about to have purple cups.

1942
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:36,190
Oh my god, we're going to have purple cups!

1943
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:38,970
Purple cups for the sloppy cream?

1944
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:41,010
We're going to make sloppy cream.

1945
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:42,670
It's coming up sloppy.

1946
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:45,850
Have you taken the orders?

1947
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:47,110
Take the orders!

1948
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:47,690
Should I?

1949
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:48,970
But we don't have the cups!

1950
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:51,970
The cups are here.

1951
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:52,550
Oh they are?

1952
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:53,350
The cups are here.

1953
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:55,370
Okay, I'm going to need help.

1954
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,370
I can't do drinks and cups and serving and orders and everything.

1955
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:00,170
I'll help you in the front end.

1956
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:02,590
The kitchen is fine.

1957
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:04,430
The kitchen is sloppy.

1958
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:07,430
This is for table number two.

1959
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:09,390
Okay, I'm flipping.

1960
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,370
Hello!

1961
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:12,030
Table number three.

1962
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:12,990
We have a British here!

1963
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:13,350
How do we get a burger?

1964
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:14,370
I haven't done that yet.

1965
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:16,690
Here's some ice cream.

1966
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:17,830
Oh, awesome.

1967
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,610
Wait, do we have ice cream now?

1968
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:20,030
Yes!

1969
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,210
Do we have ice cream?

1970
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:22,150
Do we have lettuce?

1971
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:23,090
Where the fuck is the lettuce?

1972
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:23,930
It's in the fridge.

1973
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:25,470
There's so many food!

1974
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:26,190
There.

1975
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:27,830
Okay.

1976
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,790
We need water.

1977
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:31,790
Oh, it was three fucking lettuce.

1978
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:32,830
I hate this life.

1979
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:33,150
We need water?

1980
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:34,430
What do you mean we need water?

1981
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:36,110
I'm just an infinite resource.

1982
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:36,830
No, we got it.

1983
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:37,970
Do we have drive-thru?

1984
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:39,610
No, we don't.

1985
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:40,150
I don't think.

1986
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:41,950
Wait, why is the window open?

1987
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:43,150
A ghost.

1988
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,710
It was getting hot in here.

1989
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:45,010
Yeah.

1990
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:47,610
This is for table number three!

1991
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,970
Wait, table number two's burger is still here!

1992
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:52,250
Wait, no!

1993
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:52,650
This is two.

1994
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:53,550
This is two.

1995
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:54,010
Two.

1996
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:54,950
Three.

1997
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:57,370
I need a vanilla ice cream!

1998
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:59,810
Wait, Snuffy, did you make the vanilla ice cream?

1999
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:02,290
No, no.

2000
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:02,770
Okay, wait.

2001
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:03,810
Let me make it vanilla.

2002
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:06,590
And then take it to table number two.

2003
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:09,930
Alright, table number three.

2004
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:10,810
She just left.

2005
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:11,670
I threw it in the garbage.

2006
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:14,670
We could have kept it for the next order.

2007
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:15,350
What is this?

2008
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:17,050
It's not melting or anything, right?

2009
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:20,710
Wait, I'm confused about what it was we ordered.

2010
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:22,470
Oh, no.

2011
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:24,210
This is for table number sixteen!

2012
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:25,690
Table sixteen.

2013
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:27,650
Table sixteen.

2014
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:30,550
Table sixteen is still there.

2015
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:31,430
Table sixteen is still there.

2016
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:32,250
What else do they need?

2017
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:34,810
Quick, before she leaves!

2018
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:35,410
What do they need?

2019
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:36,770
Everyone's fucking leaving.

2020
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:38,130
Table sixteen is gone!

2021
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:43,890
Stay!

2022
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:45,010
Please!

2023
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,010
Please, I'm desperate!

2024
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:52,810
Please, I made all these patties with love!

2025
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:55,110
They need to go to somebody!

2026
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:55,550
You know what?

2027
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:59,010
I'm going to go from the newest first, so I at least get to make one fucking burger.

2028
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:02,990
Strawberry ice cream, I got it.

2029
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:07,830
This is for table number eight.

2030
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:08,470
Okay.

2031
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,050
Wait, no, table number nine.

2032
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:13,330
Wait, what about table thirteen?

2033
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:17,290
I don't give a fuck about table thirteen, they're about to leave anyway.

2034
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:18,090
No, don't!

2035
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:19,590
The burgers need a home!

2036
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:21,770
They need to be adopted!

2037
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:25,030
Don't do this to the burgers!

2038
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:25,950
It worked!

2039
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:26,410
It worked!

2040
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:27,410
Table thirteen is out!

2041
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:27,850
It worked!

2042
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:28,870
It was the same thing!

2043
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:33,110
Table five needs a regular burger.

2044
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:34,650
Table nine would have been there.

2045
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:37,510
Make another one.

2046
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,830
More orders!

2047
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:39,570
More orders!

2048
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:40,530
Table number nine.

2049
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:40,810
No!

2050
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:46,590
I need another table number nine one.

2051
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:48,370
Table number nine!

2052
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:53,150
Table number nine is a double burger with lettuce, ice, and normal burger.

2053
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:55,490
But then we have...

2054
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,190
Table fourteen is a double burger.

2055
01:20:58,510 --> 01:20:59,990
Okay, table number nine, I'm taking it.

2056
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:01,770
But table nine was done.

2057
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:05,370
Table fourteen, double burger, two squirts.

2058
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:06,510
Double burger, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2059
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:07,910
You got it?

2060
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:08,490
You got it?

2061
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:09,490
You got this, you got this, Lime.

2062
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:10,350
I believe in you.

2063
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:11,070
Wait, where's Snuffy?

2064
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:12,570
Two squirts, two lettuce.

2065
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:14,830
Two squirts, two lettuce.

2066
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:16,310
Table fourteen!

2067
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:18,310
Table fourteen incoming!

2068
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:20,970
Table fourteen!

2069
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:24,670
A normal hamburger, three squirts, and lettuce.

2070
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:25,630
I'll grab the lettuce.

2071
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:27,510
These trays are not big enough!

2072
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:30,790
Okay, we just need...

2073
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:32,570
That was one, wasn't it?

2074
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:33,650
There we go.

2075
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:34,890
I hear...

2076
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,310
I don't know if there was enough lettuce in that burger.

2077
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:38,110
Is that seven?

2078
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:38,790
I got seven.

2079
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:39,890
Number seven, number seven.

2080
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:40,750
Number seven, number seven.

2081
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:42,190
Alright, alright, alright.

2082
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:43,530
No, number seven just left.

2083
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:44,030
No!

2084
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:45,770
Put it under the counter, put it under the counter.

2085
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:48,290
Table number eight's being built right now.

2086
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:49,790
Okay, I'll get the strawberry ice cream.

2087
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:51,970
Table number eight, table number eight, here we go.

2088
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:54,050
We need to go faster, people, faster!

2089
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:56,810
Oh my god, we're going as fast as we can!

2090
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:00,190
Just make a splash cola, that's all we need.

2091
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:01,350
Splash cola, splash cola!

2092
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:04,850
Making a splash cola.

2093
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:07,410
We just need one splash cola, we don't need two.

2094
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:08,710
Table number eleven.

2095
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:11,050
I don't think it was full, ow, but that's fine.

2096
01:22:11,570 --> 01:22:14,010
I got it, I got it, I got it.

2097
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:16,630
Wait, what number was this?

2098
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:22,510
Okay, I can, oh, I gotta flip, there's no more patties, I gotta flip.

2099
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:24,070
Table number seven.

2100
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:26,470
Why are we so popular, why do you keep coming to this place?

2101
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:27,690
Give us bad reviews!

2102
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:28,690
This is table number eight.

2103
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:31,110
This is the only Sloppy's in the Five Mile District.

2104
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:33,990
Oh, splash soda is too, splash soda.

2105
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:35,770
This is table number seven.

2106
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:36,730
Hello.

2107
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:41,150
How come I can't, like, just, like, take the numbers that are on the table and put them on the thing?

2108
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,450
This is table eleven, this is table eleven.

2109
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:43,450
Table eleven.

2110
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,630
Table seven.

2111
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:49,410
There's too many tables, I don't know anything anymore!

2112
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:51,430
Eleven, eleven, eleven!

2113
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:52,350
Eleven!

2114
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,920
There are only four people.

2115
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,200
Wait, which one is which, which one is which?

2116
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:16,220
I don't know.

2117
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,200
I don't understand.

2118
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,940
Table two is vanilla ice cream, table two is vanilla ice cream.

2119
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,940
Table two is vanilla ice cream, I can take it to table two.

2120
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:24,760
Table two.

2121
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:27,460
I got another one, another vanilla ice cream.

2122
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,480
Someone in my chat just said this is a chill ship.

2123
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,880
Are you fucking kidding me?

2124
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:35,300
This is a Saturday evening.

2125
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,640
Uh, vanilla, number ten, number ten, you got it, you got it.

2126
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:39,760
I got it, I got it, I got number ten, I got number ten.

2127
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,020
Table number one!

2128
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:42,340
I forgot the tray, I forgot the tray.

2129
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:43,980
Min, can you put a tray down for me?

2130
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:46,680
Take that one, take that one.

2131
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:47,800
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2132
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:51,220
Oh yeah, I'll do it, I'll put more trays up, I'll put more trays up.

2133
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,820
We leveled up, we leveled up.

2134
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:53,800
What did we get, what did we get?

2135
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,360
I don't know.

2136
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,960
I have so many trays on the table.

2137
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,420
We don't need trays on the table!

2138
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:02,100
Mayonnaise?

2139
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,680
I'm complaining about trays!

2140
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:05,240
Do your job!

2141
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:10,520
I am, I made four, five more patties and we only have one table.

2142
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:15,280
Table order number seven, a hamburger, two ketchup, three lettuce and Mr. Hoop.

2143
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,440
Mr. Hoop!

2144
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,800
This is for table number seven!

2145
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,840
We got number seven, we need Mr. Hoop!

2146
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,720
We got a double hamburger, it's a double hamburger.

2147
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,960
There you go, there you go, number seven, number seven.

2148
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,880
And a strawberry ice cream stuffy, we need a strawberry ice cream stuffy.

2149
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:33,280
Number five!

2150
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,020
I don't like it!

2151
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:41,860
No, you're better than that customer, don't listen to him.

2152
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,220
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

2153
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:44,440
Number five, you got it?

2154
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,020
OK, I got it.

2155
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:45,960
Table number six!

2156
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:50,560
He's not you, he will never... I dropped my water bottle.

2157
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:55,040
Are we making a profit, guys?

2158
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,040
We need more burgers, we need more burgers.

2159
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,260
It's 9pm, no, we don't need more burgers.

2160
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,220
We have one last guy, oh no, we have another customer coming in!

2161
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,020
We have another customer!

2162
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,460
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

2163
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,120
No, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

2164
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,240
I'm making one patty right now, I'm making one patty.

2165
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,820
You don't need one patty, I've got the burgers, they're fine!

2166
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,380
I'm picking up a delivery.

2167
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,240
OK, never mind, someone else came in, we're not fine anymore.

2168
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,540
Table number 15!

2169
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:36,200
These girls will never survive retail.

2170
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,120
Wait, I don't think we have drive-thru.

2171
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:40,120
No, we don't have drive-thru yet, guys.

2172
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:45,100
I feel like you're picking up a call, like, no, no, the drive-thru isn't open yet.

2173
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,040
Stop calling.

2174
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:49,620
Stop calling, it's not open.

2175
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:51,280
It'll never be open, please!

2176
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,640
It'll never be open before we got here.

2177
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,640
We're severely understaffed.

2178
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:58,760
Can we all cry in the freezer after this?

2179
01:25:59,140 --> 01:25:59,900
I need this burger!

2180
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:00,520
I need this burger!

2181
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,000
Look at this, we got mayonnaise!

2182
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,640
Number 11, number 11!

2183
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:06,460
OK, OK, I'm grilling the patty, I'm grilling the patty!

2184
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:09,220
Just get ready, get ready, get the other stuff ready!

2185
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:11,360
Everything, it's just...

2186
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,040
It's all ready!

2187
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:12,700
It's all ready!

2188
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:13,800
It just needs livery!

2189
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:14,280
It just needs livery!

2190
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:16,500
95, 95, here we go, here we go!

2191
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,740
You got this, guys!

2192
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:20,000
I'm delivering the ketchup.

2193
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,880
There we go, table!

2194
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:21,900
Table up!

2195
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,400
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here!

2196
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:23,980
11!

2197
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:24,640
11!

2198
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:25,780
Oh...

2199
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:26,340
We did it!

2200
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:28,820
They left.

2201
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:29,680
They left.

2202
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,960
Why are they so impatient?

2203
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:33,880
They paid for this!

2204
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,360
We should technically still be getting this money, right?

2205
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:36,920
Exactly!

2206
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:38,940
They paid for this!

2207
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:42,080
Team, who's hiding burgers in the countertops?

2208
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,920
Don't mind me!

2209
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,200
Oh my god, who did this?

2210
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:48,520
Dude, this is not, this is not OK.

2211
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,220
It's the unknowns, it's the unknowns!

2212
01:26:53,840 --> 01:27:00,060
We're gonna get a rat infestation if we keep shoving unwanted burgers into the cupboards.

2213
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,580
Yeah, but who's gonna snitch?

2214
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:03,040
Yeah, who's gonna snitch?

2215
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,280
Who's gonna snitch, huh?

2216
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,160
Who's gonna snitch?

2217
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,920
I'm just saying there's better places to put the old burgers...

2218
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:09,740
Me mouth!

2219
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:11,280
Me mouth!

2220
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:17,820
To be fair, to be fair, we could just save money by eating these burgers, you know?

2221
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:20,640
I don't think we have that capacity.

2222
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:22,720
You mean?

2223
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:26,200
Yeah, I only think I could survive, like, two burgers.

2224
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:31,040
And this every day, we eat a burger every day.

2225
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:34,220
But it's on company funds, it's literally our manager's money.

2226
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:36,080
I haven't had dinner yet, this game is making me fucking hungry.

2227
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:37,760
Me too!

2228
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,600
What an idiot.

2229
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,960
Alright guys, you guys wanna cry in the freezer for a little bit?

2230
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:43,780
Like, have a little smoke break in the freezer?

2231
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:46,580
Yeah, hold on, I'm finishing cleaning.

2232
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:49,960
I was actually just gonna do some drugs or something to cope, I don't know.

2233
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:55,380
Okay, it's time to go cry in the freezer.

2234
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,180
You guys wanna huff the grease trap with me?

2235
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:02,180
Guys, we haven't locked the grease yet though, that's level 10!

2236
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:03,980
Level 10?!

2237
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:05,080
We haven't been level 10 yet.

2238
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,520
Level 10 for grease?

2239
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,720
Get the grease.

2240
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,800
Alright, all winners to the freezer.

2241
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,840
All the winners to the freezer.

2242
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,920
I'm just here to take inventory.

2243
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:23,740
I should've finished high school.

2244
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,420
I'm sorry.

2245
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:34,760
Okay, I'm good.

2246
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,380
Were you crying about Snuffy?

2247
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,480
It was a rough day for Team Sloppy, another Saturday.

2248
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:44,080
Oh, we're locked in.

2249
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,400
Now you know how I feel.

2250
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:49,980
We're locked in.

2251
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,040
Excuse me!

2252
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,280
Are you guys coming to the car?

2253
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:57,900
We're locked in the freezer!

2254
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,100
You locked us in the freezer!

2255
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,300
How did that happen?

2256
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,240
We need to order more patties.

2257
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:11,820
If you don't open up, we're gonna order more patties.

2258
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,540
Dude, there's a first aid kit.

2259
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,960
We need to be like Heimlich certified.

2260
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:20,180
I put two of the patty things in this fridge.

2261
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:22,100
There's no Heimlich sign, I think we're okay.

2262
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,140
I thought you meant like in the first aid kit.

2263
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:28,680
This is just for show, there's actually two meat patties in there.

2264
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:34,180
You open it and the first aid is just more patties.

2265
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,760
Everything is patties.

2266
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,620
Why do they have so many burger buns?

2267
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:40,560
Holy shit!

2268
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,200
Because we sell burgers!

2269
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:47,920
The burgers come in stacks of 18 and the burger buns come in stacks of 24.

2270
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,950
This is too real, this is too real!

2271
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,420
I have a chicken nugget.

2272
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,500
This is like our inventory, man.

2273
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,160
Let's go to sleep, another day, we can make chicken nuggets.

2274
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:03,860
Another day, another dollar.

2275
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:08,940
Let's sleep for three hours so that we can get back to Slompy's brain early.

2276
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:12,080
How is this just a four person game?

2277
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:17,900
I like how we had to pool our funds and our resources to end up buying one car between all four of us.

2278
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,860
This is a business plan.

2279
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:25,360
Somebody in my chat said Mint has been ignoring the drive-thru this entire time.

2280
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:25,940
No, I haven't!

2281
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,360
There's no one at the drive-thru!

2282
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:30,420
That's why we kept hearing people honking!

2283
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:34,120
No, the honking is the deliveries, the honking are the deliveries.

2284
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:36,240
Wait, no, the delivery guy doesn't honk, does he?

2285
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,340
Yeah, he honks, he honks.

2286
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:39,580
There's no one at the drive-thru.

2287
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:42,180
Let's make some burgers in advance, please do not open the fucking restaurant.

2288
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:45,580
Hey guys, don't open the restaurant, I gotta take a massive whiz.

2289
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:49,000
You guys, I'm leaving this joint.

2290
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:50,520
I'm getting out of here.

2291
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,340
Hold on.

2292
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,020
You can't leave, nobody ever leaves.

2293
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:55,060
I mean, there is a drive-thru here.

2294
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:58,240
Yeah, but it's not open, we have to unlock it, I think.

2295
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,820
I think she's gaslighting us.

2296
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,760
No, I've never seen anybody there!

2297
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:04,500
I think she's gaslighting us.

2298
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:07,000
You guys, the water is called Mizu water.

2299
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,120
This is a weeaboo restaurant.

2300
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:13,380
What the fuck does Mizu water even mean?

2301
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:14,960
It means water, water.

2302
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,560
Water, water.

2303
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,560
I'm at the drive-thru.

2304
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,500
Anybody gonna pick up?

2305
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:26,740
800 patties on the grill, I can't flip all of this.

2306
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:29,940
You can totally flip all of that.

2307
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,360
I can't flip all of this.

2308
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,600
Oh my god, which one?

2309
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:36,020
I don't even know which one is my patty and which one is yours.

2310
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:39,060
Oh my god, there's so many patties.

2311
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:41,020
I think we're good to open.

2312
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:43,000
No, wait, wait, guys.

2313
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:47,840
Guys, someone put 20 patties.

2314
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:48,880
I had a system.

2315
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,700
Someone ruined my system.

2316
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:52,420
I'm opening the store.

2317
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:56,320
Customers, not coming yet.

2318
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:00,060
It's quiet, it's a quiet day.

2319
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,300
Oh thank god, this is what we dreamed of.

2320
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:07,360
Your patties, are they okay?

2321
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,860
My system, there's so many patties.

2322
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,680
Wait, this one's not done yet.

2323
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:18,280
We have customers inbound.

2324
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,680
Are we out of ketchup?

2325
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:22,880
I don't know.

2326
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:25,260
I thought there was some in the fridge.

2327
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,760
I don't see any ketchup.

2328
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:28,520
There's some in here.

2329
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:29,900
Oh, there's some in here?

2330
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:30,300
Okay, cool.

2331
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:31,000
I did it.

2332
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:34,800
Company doesn't mandate me having to wash my hands.

2333
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:38,040
Exactly, I agree with that.

2334
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,700
We got two customers, everybody.

2335
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:40,780
Stop checking over here.

2336
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,040
There's nobody here.

2337
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:45,280
I bet you there's gonna be a person over there.

2338
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:48,280
I bet you there's gonna be a car right there.

2339
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:50,920
I'm gonna take all these orders and I'm not gonna serve anybody.

2340
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:54,140
I'm on strike!

2341
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,300
I'm on strike!

2342
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:57,500
There's mayonnaise.

2343
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,820
Where's the mayonnaise, Suffy?

2344
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:00,440
Where is it?

2345
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:01,320
Table 16!

2346
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:04,860
Wait, what happened to it?

2347
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:05,200
Wait, what?

2348
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,320
I've ordered more.

2349
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:08,980
What does table 16 want?

2350
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,060
Table 16 just wants a hamburger.

2351
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:11,660
That's it.

2352
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:12,140
It's already.

2353
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:15,640
Table 13.

2354
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,320
If Mint starts a strike, we can hire a scab.

2355
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,200
Maybe it had to have been in the fridge or something.

2356
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:27,040
We'll hire a high schooler to help work it.

2357
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:27,400
Table 14!

2358
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,320
Someone needs to help Mint with the ice cream before she has a breakdown again.

2359
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:31,520
What do you need?

2360
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:32,160
What do you need?

2361
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:33,260
What's table 14?

2362
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:34,360
Have we gotten 14?

2363
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,260
Table 14 needs mayonnaise so we don't have it yet.

2364
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:38,680
That's 14.

2365
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:40,400
Don't do the one with the drink yet.

2366
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,140
Table 14 is fucking leaving is what they are doing.

2367
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:43,000
Wait, what?

2368
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:44,380
But we just started.

2369
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:46,980
Yeah, they are not getting their mayonnaise.

2370
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:48,240
You've been open for two hours.

2371
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,420
We just started the day.

2372
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:52,300
Mayonnaise.

2373
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:57,100
Table 4 wants a double hamburger.

2374
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,000
I'll help out with that.

2375
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,660
I'm doing table...oh yeah, we're done.

2376
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:02,700
Table 14 left.

2377
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:04,060
I'll do four.

2378
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:07,300
And then three lettuce.

2379
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:11,380
One, two, three.

2380
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:12,320
Table number 8.

2381
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,980
We need a strawberry ice cream with this.

2382
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:15,900
I got the burger.

2383
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:18,740
I'm doing table number 2.

2384
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:20,180
This is table 4.

2385
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:22,540
And then...

2386
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:23,400
Excuse me.

2387
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:26,480
We need a splash cola.

2388
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:27,640
I'll get the splash cola.

2389
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,260
Wait, we don't have cups.

2390
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,220
We have no more cups.

2391
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:34,200
Yes, we do.

2392
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:34,860
They are down there.

2393
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:35,980
We ordered cups.

2394
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:37,840
Wait, this is number 2?

2395
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:38,460
Table 2?

2396
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:39,540
Oh my gosh.

2397
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:40,440
Yeah, table 2.

2398
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,160
Splash cola.

2399
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:44,680
Okay, we got the soda.

2400
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,320
Here, I'll take it.

2401
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:46,120
You got it?

2402
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:47,000
Okay, you can take it.

2403
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:48,940
Holy shit, they want ice cream and a soda.

2404
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:51,240
Oh my god, so much.

2405
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:52,420
I think something is happening.

2406
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,960
We leveled up everybody!

2407
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,740
We need more patties.

2408
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:02,180
We need more patties?

2409
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,740
Oh, patty time, patty time.

2410
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:05,380
I'm grilling, I'm grilling, I'm grilling.

2411
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:06,600
Do we have mayonnaise?

2412
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,440
We have mayonnaise, yeah.

2413
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,860
What is this burger right here?

2414
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:11,380
Who is it for?

2415
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:13,560
Table number 3, I think.

2416
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,140
Whatever the first one is.

2417
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:15,740
Yeah, table number 3.

2418
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:18,740
Guys, come on, we can get to level 10 so we can have fries.

2419
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:21,140
We can have tomatoes and pickles now.

2420
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,420
We have tomatoes and pickles.

2421
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:23,620
No, not the pickles.

2422
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,260
We can't even cope with what we are fucking doing right now.

2423
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,560
No, we can do this guys.

2424
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:28,500
We can make it.

2425
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,100
We can see the problem.

2426
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:30,440
What?

2427
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:31,100
Why are you upset?

2428
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:34,600
Okay, table number 1.

2429
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:35,860
Table number 1.

2430
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:39,540
I think Snuffy has disassociated from working here everyday.

2431
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:40,920
I have table number 1.

2432
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,760
Is this table number 1 here?

2433
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:44,740
Yes, that's table number 1.

2434
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:45,300
Okay, I'll take it.

2435
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:49,420
I got more patties!

2436
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:50,160
I got more patties!

2437
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:51,780
I love working at Sloppy's!

2438
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:53,900
You guys, there is no one at the drive-thru!

2439
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:55,520
That was a delivery!

2440
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:56,600
Was it not a delivery?

2441
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:59,160
Table number 17!

2442
01:35:59,520 --> 01:35:59,840
Hello!

2443
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:01,240
There is nobody out here!

2444
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:05,280
Hello!

2445
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,100
Why did you say hello at the best part?

2446
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:10,160
Is this number 17?

2447
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,080
Is this burger?

2448
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,040
Maybe.

2449
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:12,800
Yes, it would have been.

2450
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:14,000
Table number 17.

2451
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:15,880
I have patties!

2452
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:18,880
I have all the patties!

2453
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,640
My burger just kind of disappeared into the ether.

2454
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:21,340
I don't know where that went.

2455
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:23,680
Light water to ice.

2456
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:26,820
We need water and vanilla ice cream.

2457
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:28,220
I'll make the vanilla ice cream.

2458
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:29,720
Okay, I got the water.

2459
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,400
Do you need a double burger with two squirts?

2460
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:33,540
This is a six.

2461
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:34,020
Put it there.

2462
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:35,640
This is 15!

2463
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:36,460
15!

2464
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:36,620
15?

2465
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:38,340
I got it!

2466
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,580
Serve that burger!

2467
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,240
I'm serving it!

2468
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,660
We need a double burger with two squirts of mayo.

2469
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,860
I'm doing a double burger with two squirts of mayo.

2470
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:49,280
Oh my god, I hate this.

2471
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:50,620
This sounds too realistic.

2472
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,640
Is this entertainment to you everybody?

2473
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,720
You at home enjoy this?

2474
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,940
I can't take it anymore!

2475
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:08,120
Don't break down on your off hours!

2476
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:08,920
You're on the clock!

2477
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:11,800
We need more TVs!

2478
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:14,660
We can't just be sharing this tiny TV together!

2479
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:17,340
We need a hamburger!

2480
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:18,960
I got the soda.

2481
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:22,260
We need a hamburger with two ketchup squirts and three lettuce.

2482
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,580
And a splash cola with one ice.

2483
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,520
Splash cola with one ice set.

2484
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:28,300
Yeah, that's it.

2485
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,220
Table number six!

2486
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,760
Table number six!

2487
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,680
We have the splash cola?

2488
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:36,000
Uh, not yet.

2489
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:37,420
I'm working on it.

2490
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,120
One ice.

2491
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:40,140
Splash cola.

2492
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:42,440
Alright, I'm taking this order!

2493
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:43,220
Okay.

2494
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:45,520
Number six.

2495
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:47,320
Sloppy serves you.

2496
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,100
Sloppy serves you with a smile.

2497
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:53,040
We are top customer satisfaction.

2498
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:56,800
I'm taking this away from you.

2499
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:59,100
Otherwise we can never smile again.

2500
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,320
Table number fourteen!

2501
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,380
Wait, who is this?

2502
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:08,840
Mr. Sloppy is going to get you.

2503
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:11,080
What's our mascot?

2504
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:13,860
Mr. Sloppy is our mascot.

2505
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:15,780
He's just a very sloppy burger.

2506
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,140
He's like dripping all over the place.

2507
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:21,920
He's dripping all the sauce on the floor.

2508
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:24,140
He's like, remember to smile.

2509
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:25,240
Vanilla ice cream.

2510
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:25,740
Sloppy.

2511
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:28,020
Nice.

2512
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:28,860
Splash cola.

2513
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:31,120
Maybe they won't notice.

2514
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:32,160
What happened?

2515
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:33,340
Nothing.

2516
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:35,400
Table number seven!

2517
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:40,360
How are the supplies looking?

2518
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,180
They better not spit in my face.

2519
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:45,260
I don't think we are going to make it to level ten, guys.

2520
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:46,560
Yes we will!

2521
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:49,040
I don't think we are going to make it, guys.

2522
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,520
Table number three!

2523
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:51,340
Number three!

2524
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:53,340
I think I remember Sloppy's.

2525
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,600
Number three!

2526
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:59,020
It's going to be the best sloppy chain in all of America.

2527
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:04,180
A sloppy burger, three squirts of ketchup, three lettuce, and two mayo.

2528
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:09,280
Guys, we have one more hour until our shift is over!

2529
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:10,380
Oh my god, finally!

2530
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:12,760
A sloppy customer...

2531
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,880
is a sloppy customer.

2532
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:18,740
I love working at Sloppy's.

2533
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:21,800
What's our jingle?

2534
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:25,000
We have one last customer coming in!

2535
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,520
Table number...

2536
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:36,880
Guys, I trust Mr. Sloppy.

2537
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:38,320
Table number ten!

2538
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:45,080
I'm flipping the burger in five!

2539
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:47,260
Level up, baby!

2540
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:47,400
Yay!

2541
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:51,840
Sloppy's prevail!

2542
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:56,960
Two more customers coming in!

2543
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:00,000
Tell them to fuck off, we have no wrapping paper!

2544
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:00,800
No, it's okay!

2545
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:02,100
Oh, we have no wrapping paper?

2546
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,280
It's really important, I hear.

2547
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,160
Just put them on a plate!

2548
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:08,220
Serve them raw!

2549
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:09,920
Throw them in their face!

2550
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:13,220
I think they would prefer we didn't have...

2551
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:15,160
Eat to here, no to go orders.

2552
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:17,360
We'll just use napkins as the wrapping paper.

2553
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,380
They won't notice!

2554
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:19,960
Is this table number twelve?

2555
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:20,740
I'm taking it over.

2556
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:22,080
Can someone help me unload this, please?

2557
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:24,700
I'm flipping burgers!

2558
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,800
Who's not busy right now?

2559
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:29,420
She liked it, even without the burger.

2560
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:30,260
I think we're good.

2561
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:31,600
Okay, okay.

2562
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:33,920
I got you, I got you.

2563
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:36,580
This isn't wrapping paper, this is just ice cream.

2564
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:37,640
This guy just wants to drink in an ice cream.

2565
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:39,420
Drink in an ice cream.

2566
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,600
Manager, I thought you wanted wrapping paper.

2567
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:43,620
I got it, I got it.

2568
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:45,940
No, I couldn't because someone was ordering tomatoes!

2569
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:47,480
Who ordered tomatoes?

2570
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:48,760
We don't need tomatoes!

2571
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:50,260
I don't know!

2572
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:51,680
They make me happy.

2573
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:56,360
Snuffy, you clogged up the delivery chain with tomatoes that weren't being ordered!

2574
01:40:56,720 --> 01:41:00,740
I asked if anybody needed anything and nobody said anything.

2575
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,540
We were busy screaming at each other!

2576
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:04,640
Oh, they left.

2577
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:05,880
Wait, no, they didn't leave.

2578
01:41:06,380 --> 01:41:09,080
Oh, I found a burger from yesterday on the floor.

2579
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:09,840
Use this one.

2580
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:12,480
That's from today.

2581
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:13,360
Maybe it's the right burger.

2582
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:14,780
Maybe it's the right one.

2583
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:15,940
We got pickles!

2584
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:21,100
Everybody's leaving!

2585
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,720
Everybody's leaving!

2586
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:24,980
Everybody's leaving!

2587
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,600
Let's make the nasty patty.

2588
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:30,820
Everybody is leaving because we don't have any fucking burger wrappers.

2589
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:31,460
Yeah, just put it in there.

2590
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:33,640
Order a burger wrapper, we can order it now.

2591
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:34,920
I did order it.

2592
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:36,200
You guys, it's time!

2593
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,120
We're closed!

2594
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:37,660
Yippee!

2595
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:38,240
We did it!

2596
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:39,980
We did it!

2597
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:43,300
Does that mean we can get french fries tomorrow?

2598
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:45,560
Well, we need two more levels.

2599
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:46,700
To be level 10.

2600
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:49,340
What if the level 10 also comes with the drive-thru?

2601
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:50,420
What if that's...

2602
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:52,400
I'm so excited to work the drive-thru.

2603
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:53,580
I've been working on my speech.

2604
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:54,780
Okay, you get the drive-thru.

2605
01:41:54,980 --> 01:41:57,120
We can't even cope with the current orders!

2606
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:58,000
No, it's okay!

2607
01:41:58,640 --> 01:41:59,840
We're leveling up!

2608
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:00,980
We're getting better!

2609
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:01,780
We're doing so good.

2610
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,820
Wait, Snuffy, how are you at the drive-thru?

2611
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,020
I'll be your Lime AI.

2612
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:12,720
Nobody can know about that, dude.

2613
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:16,440
It's like having a teddy bear to sleep with.

2614
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,200
I just like, I pull the string in its back and it's just like, Hi, Snuffy, it's me, Lime.

2615
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:25,420
It's how I get through the night.

2616
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:29,640
Wait, you do all this with the AI instead of me?

2617
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:30,900
I'm embarrassed.

2618
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:35,600
You don't understand, Lime.

2619
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:37,900
AI Lime has a special touch.

2620
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:40,320
You're not there for her 24-7.

2621
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:41,440
She needed somebody.

2622
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:48,640
If you were there for her 24-7, she wouldn't have resorted to AI and not look at her.

2623
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:52,080
Lime is a beautiful, independent queen.

2624
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:54,460
I mean nothing.

2625
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:55,540
Which Lime?

2626
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:03,080
She thinks she's literally worthless.

2627
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:04,220
What?

2628
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:05,500
You like them broken?

2629
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:07,280
Damn.

2630
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:11,800
I try and convince her that that's not the reality, but she insists.

2631
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:14,460
Oh, so you like fixing people.

2632
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:20,120
Why do you think you guys want me to be the manager?

2633
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:24,500
Oh my god, Doki started crying.

2634
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:26,240
She was like, it's my time.

2635
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:27,540
It's my time.

2636
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:28,900
I can order a burger.

2637
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,740
I want to order my burger.

2638
01:43:30,740 --> 01:43:31,620
Come on, Doki.

2639
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:32,600
It's time for sleep.

2640
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:33,480
Okay.

2641
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:34,720
Actually, never mind.

2642
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:35,500
I'm getting out of here.

2643
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:36,860
I'm leaving.

2644
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:42,220
If she never touches the car, we'll never start the next day.

2645
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:44,800
What a life.

2646
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:48,640
Guys...

2647
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:49,840
I don't...

2648
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,440
I don't want to work in a real fast food restaurant.

2649
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:53,900
When is this collab over?

2650
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:54,080
What's the matter?

2651
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,700
We had $67 yesterday!

2652
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:05,160
Guys, what if we just go in a corner and just, you know, have a chat?

2653
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:08,880
What if we didn't open today?

2654
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:11,380
Yeah, what if we just didn't open today?

2655
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:14,200
What if we eat all the burgers for ourselves?

2656
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:14,580
Yeah!

2657
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:16,680
Let's just have a burger party!

2658
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:19,580
And just, you know, have a talk, you know?

2659
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:20,600
Wait, wait, wait.

2660
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:21,940
Guys, can you actually sprint?

2661
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:23,900
You guys feel so much faster than me.

2662
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:25,600
I can't sprint.

2663
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,840
It just looks like you're sprinting.

2664
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:30,840
If you jump, we go faster.

2665
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:35,340
Are we gonna put the burgies on?

2666
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:40,800
I don't want to be the flipper anymore.

2667
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:43,660
I'm tired of flipping burgers.

2668
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:47,160
I think there's more to life than flipping burgers.

2669
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,580
I've worked like three days in a row.

2670
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:52,140
This can't be healthy.

2671
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,280
You worked three days in a row?

2672
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:58,020
I worked four days in a row.

2673
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:00,280
No, you worked two days.

2674
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,220
And the other two were AI-doki, okay?

2675
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:03,180
Everybody knows.

2676
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:08,080
Somebody else flipped the burger.

2677
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:09,980
I refused to flip the burger.

2678
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:11,280
Who turned the sign on?

2679
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:13,300
I didn't do it.

2680
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:15,560
I'm just too eager to work at Sloppy's.

2681
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:19,800
I think Snuffy is actually Spongebob.

2682
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:27,820
I think Min and I are both Squidward and the sign is Krusty.

2683
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:34,340
Order's up, everybody!

2684
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:37,820
What do you mean, order's up?

2685
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:38,640
There's no food!

2686
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:40,700
The order's...

2687
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:41,880
They're up.

2688
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,560
They're up right now.

2689
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:44,360
I'll work with Min.

2690
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,620
Okay, you do the drinks then.

2691
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:48,300
You do the drinks.

2692
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:51,460
That's great, there's zero drinks here.

2693
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:52,760
Okay, screw you.

2694
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:53,720
Make some drinks.

2695
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,720
This guy is gonna order a drink right now.

2696
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:00,680
He didn't.

2697
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:02,600
We ordered an ice cream.

2698
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:04,320
You chose the wrong one.

2699
01:46:04,420 --> 01:46:05,640
I already got it.

2700
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:09,680
Where's the burgers, guys?

2701
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:11,200
I'm cooking the burgers.

2702
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:13,120
We need table number four!

2703
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,440
Right now!

2704
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,460
Table number four!

2705
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:17,580
Come on, Spongebob, where are the burgers?

2706
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,100
I'm sorry to inform you, we are probably bombed.

2707
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:20,700
No!

2708
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:21,940
Hello!

2709
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:24,020
One moment, sir.

2710
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,220
Sloppy's is forever.

2711
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:27,060
Here are the burgers.

2712
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:27,880
One pickle.

2713
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:28,640
Burger.

2714
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,220
Order number whatever the first one is.

2715
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:31,600
Four!

2716
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,140
Don't forget his ice cream!

2717
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:36,980
I got it.

2718
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:39,400
Wait, I never put a burger in it.

2719
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:39,560
What?

2720
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:40,140
What do you mean?

2721
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,400
He never put a burger in it.

2722
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:44,040
Oh, he's fine.

2723
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:45,520
He was fine with it.

2724
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:46,800
It was just a bun.

2725
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:50,200
I think he...

2726
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:51,680
Oh, did he leave?

2727
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,220
No, he ate it.

2728
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:54,100
He's eating it.

2729
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:55,700
I gave it to him.

2730
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:59,280
Even the popularity went up.

2731
01:46:59,500 --> 01:46:59,900
We're good.

2732
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:02,360
He loves a good veggie patty.

2733
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:03,460
What's the vegetarian?

2734
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:05,660
Our other strawberry is deteriorating.

2735
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:07,540
Oh, they all left.

2736
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:08,280
They all left.

2737
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:08,680
Everything sucks.

2738
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:11,420
No, number 17 is still here.

2739
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:13,960
Yeah, but my...

2740
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:14,520
Just make it!

2741
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:17,400
No, just make it without the bun!

2742
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,240
Just make it without the bun!

2743
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:20,640
It's only 1230!

2744
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,320
You have five more hours before you cry!

2745
01:47:25,700 --> 01:47:28,440
These guys are waiting so I'm taking their orders.

2746
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,120
Orders craziness!

2747
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:33,560
Why did we start taking orders before you fucking burgers are ready?

2748
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:34,360
I hate this game!

2749
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:38,660
Why don't we just all stop working, guys?

2750
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:40,020
Okay, let's all strike.

2751
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:44,920
I think the burger production line might need some help with this many ingredients.

2752
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:46,320
It's actually kind of bonkers.

2753
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:48,680
Oh my god, that's a lot.

2754
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:49,480
Yeah!

2755
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:52,820
And every burger is like, yeah, you gotta put all these perfectly.

2756
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:54,120
This is table number 16.

2757
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:56,120
I'm gonna tap dance on the ingredients.

2758
01:47:56,460 --> 01:48:00,600
You can make the even burger numbers Somebody can make the odd burgers.

2759
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:03,300
Ooh, the pickles!

2760
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:06,720
I don't think we're serving enough today.

2761
01:48:10,340 --> 01:48:13,440
Oh my gosh, I'm creating the meme, you guys!

2762
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:14,360
The viral meme!

2763
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:20,340
Number 15.

2764
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:22,760
Burger King foot lettuce.

2765
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:25,540
Sloppy foot lettuce.

2766
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:28,140
Yeah, Sloppy, I think our server's quitted.

2767
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:28,800
You know what?

2768
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:29,660
Screw...

2769
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:30,920
Oh, this guy just wants a drink.

2770
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:32,560
I can get that for him.

2771
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:34,960
Light splash cola.

2772
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:37,780
I got you, buddy.

2773
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:39,500
Alright, bootlicker.

2774
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:42,540
Wait, who's the bootlicker?

2775
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:45,260
Snuffier!

2776
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:48,000
You see how great Sloppy is?

2777
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:48,960
I love Sloppy!

2778
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:53,300
Where's the mayo?

2779
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:53,940
Oh...

2780
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:56,300
They left, Snuffy, they're gone.

2781
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:57,960
All of our orders are gone, what happened?

2782
01:48:58,860 --> 01:48:59,880
It's all because of you!

2783
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:02,180
Don't sit on the table instead of taking orders!

2784
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,400
I'm close to the restaurant!

2785
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:05,160
Restaurant!

2786
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:07,120
No, it's not!

2787
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:13,900
We have customers!

2788
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:15,320
We have customers!

2789
01:49:16,060 --> 01:49:18,140
You're not even serving them anymore!

2790
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:19,100
Table 16!

2791
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:20,420
Table 16!

2792
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,380
Table 16 is...

2793
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:23,760
Yoma.

2794
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:27,540
It's ok, boss, we can still make it.

2795
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:29,280
What are you making, Snuffy?

2796
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,260
I'm making 16.

2797
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:33,400
No, we already made 16.

2798
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:35,420
I'll make table 12.

2799
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,100
I'm making...

2800
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:38,420
6.

2801
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,340
Yo mama.

2802
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:43,680
I'm helping.

2803
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:46,160
I need more mayonnaise.

2804
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:48,760
You already made a Mr. Who?

2805
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:49,920
A Mr. Who?

2806
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:52,100
Ok, I got Mr. Who.

2807
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:53,420
Oh yeah, make the Mr. Who.

2808
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:55,240
Mr. Who?

2809
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:56,400
No, no ice.

2810
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:59,120
Everybody likes a room temperature.

2811
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,680
I ordered mayonnaise...

2812
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:03,240
but no ketchup.

2813
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:05,040
Oh, are we out of ketchup?

2814
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:07,180
We gotta remember to put stuff in the fridge.

2815
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:08,660
I'm closing shop, everybody.

2816
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:10,560
Shop is already closed!

2817
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,760
Who did this?

2818
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:14,780
Who could have done such a thing?

2819
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:16,400
No, but sloppies!

2820
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:17,200
My passion!

2821
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:18,840
My passion!

2822
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:21,680
My passion for patties!

2823
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,940
We just lost table number 12!

2824
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:28,720
You ordered two entire vats of mayonnaise and no ketchup?

2825
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:32,960
I had put this order in before your feed.

2826
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,780
What if we become a mayo-only establishment?

2827
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:39,680
You ordered an entire delivery truck for two giant vats of mayonnaise!

2828
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:41,820
This is the person you want as a manager!

2829
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:45,760
You're gonna need mayo!

2830
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:52,080
Mayo has never served a greater purpose.

2831
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:53,640
Honestly, yeah.

2832
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:55,880
I agree with Snuffy.

2833
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:58,840
That's why I endorse her as manager.

2834
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:06,900
That's why you're gonna be here to turn things around.

2835
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,520
You're gonna control the staff.

2836
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,700
Boss, I wanna make chicken nugget.

2837
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:14,800
Okay, we could barely even make french fries, guys.

2838
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:17,860
Snuffy for manager!

2839
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:19,660
Everyone's a fan of her!

2840
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:21,640
Snuffy for manager!

2841
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:23,720
Everyone's a fan of her!

2842
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:26,940
We'll never run out of mayonnaise while Snuffy's here.

2843
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:30,040
We'll run out of everything else but not mayonnaise.

2844
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:36,520
That's why she'd be a perfect...

2845
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:38,880
Snuffy for manager.

2846
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,760
She does cry-mo.

2847
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:41,720
Everyone's a fan of her!

2848
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:42,840
Down with Lime-o!

2849
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:45,060
She does cry-mo!

2850
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:49,400
Everyone's a fan of her!

2851
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:50,940
Down with Lime-o!

2852
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:52,560
She does cry-mo!

2853
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:04,340
I'm allergic to strawberry, but I don't care.

2854
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:05,520
I'm on the company's dime.

2855
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,320
Down with Lime-o!

2856
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:12,580
She does cry-mo!

2857
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:14,260
Snuffy for manager!

2858
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:16,300
Everyone's a fan of her!

2859
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:18,420
Okay, you know what, then?

2860
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:19,200
You know what, then?

2861
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:20,120
You go.

2862
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:20,980
You do the burgers.

2863
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:24,040
Good luck with the fucking lettuce and the pickles.

2864
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:26,660
And all of the squirts of mayo and ketchup.

2865
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,620
Especially when Snuffy doesn't order any fucking ketchup!

2866
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:31,000
It's just an average day in the kitchen.

2867
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:32,500
I'm going to the freezer, goodbye.

2868
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:35,600
We have orders!

2869
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:35,800
We have orders!

2870
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:38,780
What do you do with the tomato?

2871
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:39,900
How do you make it?

2872
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:41,940
Like on the burger.

2873
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:44,360
Guys, do you think we're going to pass our health exam?

2874
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:48,240
Is corporate going to like us?

2875
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:50,300
Guys...

2876
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:51,140
I'm taking a nap.

2877
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:53,540
Chat, how do you cut the burger?

2878
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:55,600
How do you dice the tomato?

2879
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:56,840
What do you do with this?

2880
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:58,720
Oh, I figured it out.

2881
01:52:58,780 --> 01:52:59,500
Why wasn't it working?

2882
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:00,360
What the fuck?

2883
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:02,100
Okay.

2884
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:05,920
This is the Sloppy's dream.

2885
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:08,740
Look at everybody walking out.

2886
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:09,280
Happy.

2887
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:10,760
Customers.

2888
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:11,840
Full tummies.

2889
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:15,640
This is what Sloppy's is all about.

2890
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:19,620
I don't think we fed a single fucking person today, man.

2891
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:21,300
Oh no, they did.

2892
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:22,180
Look, here's a tip.

2893
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:23,340
$30!

2894
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:24,180
$30!

2895
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,320
Was that the burger with no burger on it?

2896
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:28,640
Oh my god, $30!

2897
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:30,600
We did so well!

2898
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:34,400
You guys thought we were nothing but Sloppy's and everything.

2899
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:36,660
Guys, I just realized, I don't think those are tips.

2900
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:39,320
I think those are their orders.

2901
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,180
I think they pay after they eat.

2902
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:45,680
Yes, that sounds right.

2903
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:47,260
The system is that.

2904
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:49,460
So you're not just robbing all these people?

2905
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:53,780
Wait, so they don't even like...

2906
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,720
What's the point of having a cashier here?

2907
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:57,620
Why do we have a card reader?

2908
01:53:57,620 --> 01:54:00,900
So they've been walking out and we haven't been pocketing their money.

2909
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:06,260
What's the point of having a card reader paying us?

2910
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,400
No, they weren't paying us a goddamn thing unless we fed them.

2911
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:11,600
Yeah, they weren't paying us unless we fed them.

2912
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:12,620
That's very fair.

2913
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:15,380
That's not fair.

2914
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:21,920
Is that why you were just putting the burgers underneath the drinks thing because you thought we were getting paid anyway?

2915
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:22,360
No.

2916
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:24,760
What's the point?

2917
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:26,860
Why are there pickles everywhere?

2918
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,240
You guys are so...

2919
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:30,740
I'm so hungry.

2920
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:32,320
Were you about to say sloppy?

2921
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:39,000
Everybody, here's a cup of ice cream on me.

2922
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:42,540
And a Mr. Hoop.

2923
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:46,720
How can you guys enjoy ice cream when Sloppy's is in the state that it's in?

2924
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:50,300
Okay, fucking bootlicker.

2925
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:52,560
Okay.

2926
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:54,740
What happened to we love Sloppy?

2927
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:56,540
Jesus, that didn't last very long.

2928
01:54:57,460 --> 01:54:59,760
Okay, Doki, we have to change the slogan.

2929
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:03,720
What's your new slogan?

2930
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:11,960
Down with...

2931
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:13,200
What rhymes with Snuffy?

2932
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:14,620
Whoa.

2933
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:18,100
Down with Snuffy.

2934
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:20,000
She's too stuffy.

2935
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,160
Down with Snuffy.

2936
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:23,300
She's too stuffy.

2937
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:28,120
Hey, Snuffy, do you want to come in the freezer with me and see how many burgers they make without us?

2938
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,740
Doki, we can run this place by ourselves.

2939
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:37,280
I was a griller and she was a cashier.

2940
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:39,020
Yeah, we know everything now.

2941
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:42,040
Get out of our kitchen.

2942
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:46,200
All you guys did was order supplies.

2943
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:47,020
What?

2944
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:54,480
We're the backbone of this company.

2945
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:58,520
But you pushed us too far.

2946
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:01,280
You didn't appreciate us.

2947
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,880
I'm a machine that turns meat into burgers.

2948
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:06,400
Hi, Snuffy.

2949
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:08,100
We're just going to chill here, I think.

2950
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:08,540
You get it?

2951
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:09,280
Because we're in a freezer.

2952
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:11,260
I just want to make burgers.

2953
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:13,280
If they want to dethrone me, that's okay.

2954
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:14,080
I'm still working.

2955
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:17,640
I make two faces out of the two burgers that we have.

2956
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:19,660
So I can only really make one face.

2957
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,440
And he looks kind of horrified.

2958
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,200
If you look at it from this angle, anyway.

2959
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:23,860
Are there emotes in this place?

2960
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:29,600
This place is not as bad as we think it is.

2961
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,500
Nah, it's actually pretty good.

2962
01:56:32,140 --> 01:56:32,540
Sloppies.

2963
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:34,260
Yeah, sloppies.

2964
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:37,320
The management sucks, though.

2965
01:56:37,420 --> 01:56:37,920
I'm not going to lie.

2966
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:42,040
Under new management, if it wasn't us, it would be better.

2967
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:43,200
I know, right?

2968
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:47,960
If it was run just a little bit better, then maybe we wouldn't have enjoyed our time here.

2969
01:56:48,100 --> 01:56:52,140
Yeah, too bad the management ran it to the ground.

2970
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:58,760
I think Limu is having an aneurysm right now.

2971
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:02,860
No, I'm great.

2972
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:03,960
I'm having a good time.

2973
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:05,960
Are you in the freezer?

2974
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:07,760
Are you in the freezer?

2975
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:08,860
What are you guys doing?

2976
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:10,740
What are you guys doing?

2977
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:11,300
Are you playing?

2978
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:16,440
We're literally making a face with the three items that we have.

2979
01:57:16,540 --> 01:57:17,760
It's a face.

2980
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:20,600
It's Squidward.

2981
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,420
It's Squidward.

2982
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,900
When it was like this, it was a face.

2983
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:25,840
But then it became a dick.

2984
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:29,340
I just have to act more like Spongebob where I'll be like, Hi, Doki!

2985
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:32,220
Hi, Doki!

2986
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:35,940
Wait, the manager locked us in.

2987
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:39,360
This is what you get.

2988
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:40,700
This is the price of rebellion.

2989
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:42,900
What did Snuffy do?

2990
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,820
She was the most optimal employee.

2991
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:46,400
She was literally Spongebob.

2992
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:51,400
If I could let Snuffy out without letting you guys out, I would, but unfortunately, it's a triple murder today.

2993
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:53,480
So you'll punish her for all her actions?

2994
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:56,360
Limu can handle it.

2995
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:58,420
Snuffy is so sweet.

2996
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,740
Anyway, Snuffy, I'll eat an ice cream in your honor.

2997
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:03,640
Can you at least cover me in sloppy...

2998
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:08,780
I'd like to go down...

2999
01:58:08,780 --> 01:58:09,920
Sloppy style.

3000
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,820
You wanna go down sloppy style?

3001
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:20,980
I'm ready to perish.

3002
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:23,060
Little bites right now.

3003
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:25,240
Snuffy, come out.

3004
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:25,740
No!

3005
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:29,260
Hey!

3006
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:32,020
It's just me in here.

3007
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:33,660
Does it look like I'm shaking ass?

3008
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:35,700
They're twerking on the door.

3009
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:38,540
I wanna see the twerking on the door.

3010
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:41,280
You'll never get to see the twerking.

3011
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:43,320
You'll never get to see it.

3012
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:44,580
Fine, I'll just make...

3013
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:45,980
I'll make patty faces.

3014
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:51,480
It's really fun the first 18 times you do it, then it gets a bit stale.

3015
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:53,420
Yeah, I believe it.

3016
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:55,720
You're missing out.

3017
01:58:56,060 --> 01:58:56,340
No!

3018
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:59,020
You could've been there.

3019
01:58:59,100 --> 01:58:59,840
Oh my god.

3020
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:05,180
This is why...

3021
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:07,400
This is my reflexes coming in.

3022
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:07,740
Alright, Min.

3023
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:10,940
It looks like when you were doing it, it looks like...

3024
01:59:10,940 --> 01:59:13,160
We're like grandpas who don't understand it.

3025
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:15,920
We're like barely going fully up and down.

3026
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:17,600
We're going fully down.

3027
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:19,240
We just have bad knees, okay?

3028
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:19,400
Yeah.

3029
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,280
Look, we've been on the grill for so long.

3030
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:26,520
Like, we just don't know how to function anymore.

3031
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:28,320
Boss never let me have a chair.

3032
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:31,140
You're right.

3033
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:32,800
We never got to sit down.

3034
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:33,420
Never.

3035
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:36,960
I wanna know what's on the management panel eventually.

3036
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:38,960
Presumably it'll be like upgrades that make this not fucking awful.

3037
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:40,180
Wait, you're not even the manager?

3038
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:41,440
Wait, you're not...

3039
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:43,960
The application's just not here.

3040
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,200
What's the watcher?

3041
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,340
That's what I'm more curious about.

3042
01:59:47,940 --> 01:59:52,720
Yeah, I think once we get the manager stuff, we'll be able to hire automated employees and things like that.

3043
01:59:52,780 --> 01:59:56,740
Because as it is, this is fucking crazy after the first two ingredients.

3044
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:59,780
I don't even know if this game will ever get a full release.

3045
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:04,380
It says it's supposed to, but you know how it is.

3046
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:07,740
I guess we'll see.

3047
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:08,960
You know?

3048
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,240
I wish I could just squirt ketchup into my mouth.

3049
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:13,080
You know what's stopping you?

3050
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:17,400
Take a burger, put it on the bun, and you can squirt a ridiculous amount of mayonnaise.

3051
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:21,700
You guys wanna squirt our mayonnaise onto the same bun together?

3052
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:23,760
Yeah, hold on, let me refill the mayonnaise.

3053
02:00:24,380 --> 02:00:25,860
Oh, do we have any mayonnaise left?

3054
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:27,700
Oh yeah, because you ordered like 17 vats of it.

3055
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:31,480
And now it's being utilized.

3056
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:34,380
Yeah, see, this was the plan.

3057
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:37,160
You have to trust the process.

3058
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:38,580
Do we have any more mayonnaise?

3059
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:39,320
No?

3060
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:40,540
Okay, only a lot.

3061
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:41,860
Let's just squirt at a time then.

3062
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:44,480
How do I put the...is this empty?

3063
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:45,640
No, it's not empty.

3064
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:46,780
How do I put...

3065
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:47,760
One more ice cream.

3066
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:49,720
Yeah, put it in the wrapper.

3067
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:54,020
You can do this all by yourself.

3068
02:00:54,100 --> 02:00:54,900
You don't need limes.

3069
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:57,040
You don't even know how to put mayonnaise on a fucking bun!

3070
02:00:57,420 --> 02:00:58,360
I do!

3071
02:00:59,160 --> 02:00:59,800
Look, see?

3072
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:02,660
Look at that.

3073
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,020
I did it.

3074
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:05,000
Here you go, Doki.

3075
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:06,760
Would you eat this burger I just made for you?

3076
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:08,600
No.

3077
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:11,460
Anybody want this burger I just made?

3078
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:13,360
Would you eat this mayonnaise?

3079
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:14,640
Thank you.

3080
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:18,980
Gonna put this here.

3081
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,280
Put food on tray first while I'm alone.

3082
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:23,040
That's kind of sensational.

3083
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:27,740
Imagine putting 15 squirts of mayonnaise in between these buns and then oiling it up.

3084
02:01:28,160 --> 02:01:28,940
You should do it.

3085
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:30,060
What's stopping you?

3086
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:33,160
I would love to see that.

3087
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:34,480
I would love to see what happens in the fire.

3088
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:36,040
This is the sound of my internal dialogue.

3089
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:39,380
Did anyone actually try the Krabby Patty at Wendy's?

3090
02:01:40,540 --> 02:01:42,300
No, because I live in England.

3091
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:45,520
Oh sorry, I was talking to the Americans here.

3092
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:46,540
It's a pineapple under the sea.

3093
02:01:46,980 --> 02:01:48,960
I was talking to the real people here.

3094
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:54,580
You guys, I'm making the kitchen sink.

3095
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:56,340
You're making what?

3096
02:01:56,680 --> 02:01:57,200
The kitchen sink?

3097
02:01:57,260 --> 02:02:00,260
I mixed all the sodas together.

3098
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:01,020
Oh!

3099
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:03,300
The classic.

3100
02:02:04,060 --> 02:02:05,160
Somebody chug it.

3101
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,820
You can wait until it gets warm.

3102
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:10,420
That's when it tastes the most flavorful.

3103
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:12,640
Put it on the grill.

3104
02:02:13,940 --> 02:02:15,320
Put it on the grill?

3105
02:02:15,660 --> 02:02:16,140
That's true.

3106
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:18,020
Have we ever even had coffee?

3107
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:18,940
We can't.

3108
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:20,980
We don't have coffee beans in the grinder.

3109
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:24,040
I was looking forward to making the frothy milk.

3110
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:25,380
Because it's a funny noise.

3111
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:26,440
Yeah.

3112
02:02:27,940 --> 02:02:29,260
It's an even better noise.

3113
02:02:31,420 --> 02:02:36,820
There's a barista simulator and it was one of the most stressful simulators I've ever played.

3114
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:39,160
Because it was incredibly realistic.

3115
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:41,380
This felt realistic too.

3116
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:47,380
People in the reviews were saying it reminds me of the time when I was a barista, but not the good way.

3117
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:55,640
You actually have to do the step-by-step on how to make the coffee.

3118
02:02:58,220 --> 02:02:59,700
I wanted to cry.

3119
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:03,960
Please respect it.

3120
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:06,040
Please respect it.

3121
02:03:06,660 --> 02:03:07,280
Intrusive thought.

3122
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:08,880
Did you shove my hand under here?

3123
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:12,940
Intrusive thought.

3124
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:15,220
We should dunk Doki's head into the fryer.

3125
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:16,640
That would be funny.

3126
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:17,960
We don't have any oil though.

3127
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:19,180
Can we order it?

3128
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:20,620
Intrusive.

3129
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:21,360
Intrusive.

3130
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,700
No, we have to do level 10.

3131
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:25,940
Level 10 unlocks everything.

3132
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:29,360
Look how beautifully clean these fryers are.

3133
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:30,560
I know, right?

3134
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:31,660
There's no contamination.

3135
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:32,860
Wait, there's contamination?

3136
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:35,500
How do you contaminate it?

3137
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:39,640
There's an oil waste jug and you have to empty it out every now and again.

3138
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:43,540
I thought fryers kill off bacteria because it's too hot.

3139
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:47,180
Maybe you can just dump peanut oil in there or something and kill someone.

3140
02:03:47,180 --> 02:03:47,620
I don't know.

3141
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:51,800
You have to recycle the grease and filter it.

3142
02:03:52,140 --> 02:03:54,800
How do you know so much about it, Snuffy?

3143
02:03:56,500 --> 02:04:00,060
I've worked nothing but these shitty 10-Edge jobs in my life.

3144
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:04,520
Doki, have you never worked fast food?

3145
02:04:05,020 --> 02:04:06,620
I've never done fast food before.

3146
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:08,140
You're so lucky.

3147
02:04:08,540 --> 02:04:10,160
How realistic was this game?

3148
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:11,940
It was pretty realistic, I think.

3149
02:04:11,940 --> 02:04:12,860
No.

3150
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:17,080
Wait, Snuffy, is that why you love first-line tech support?

3151
02:04:17,700 --> 02:04:19,200
I just... I don't know.

3152
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:20,560
This just gets me going.

3153
02:04:20,780 --> 02:04:22,620
I love systematic things.

3154
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:24,580
I love a good burger.

3155
02:04:25,420 --> 02:04:26,580
I love Swappies!

3156
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:29,560
See, this is why I felt like Snuffy would've been the best manager.

3157
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:31,220
Don't you fucking start again.

3158
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:32,180
I swear to God.

3159
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:34,220
Have you worked at fast food?

3160
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:37,760
I've worked first-line support and it was fucking miserable.

3161
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:38,700
But no, not fast food.

3162
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:39,300
Exactly.

3163
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:41,500
She has the real-life experiences.

3164
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:42,660
She has...

3165
02:04:42,660 --> 02:04:44,460
She spent years in the grind.

3166
02:04:44,860 --> 02:04:45,840
She deserves it.

3167
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:46,940
No, you're right.

3168
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:50,660
Limes is the crusty and I'm the Spongebob.

3169
02:04:50,660 --> 02:04:51,340
You mean Krabs?

3170
02:04:53,180 --> 02:04:55,300
Who's the crusty and who's the Krabs?

3171
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:57,740
Yeah, who's the crusty and who's the Krabs?

3172
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:02,640
Snuffy is the most optimal Spongebob.

3173
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:05,160
I just wanna grill a patty.

3174
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:07,040
She is the most optimal.

3175
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:07,660
No, you're right.

3176
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:08,540
Limes is.

3177
02:05:08,620 --> 02:05:11,320
I mean, do you want to try one more?

3178
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:13,960
Because it kinda felt like we were collectively having a mental breakdown.

3179
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:16,480
You know what?

3180
02:05:16,580 --> 02:05:18,480
I think Snuffy should solo this.

3181
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:20,380
Go, Snuffy, go.

3182
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:21,280
Snuffy, go.

3183
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:26,820
Alright, everybody in favor of Snuffy...

3184
02:05:26,820 --> 02:05:28,000
I can't do this without my sloppy crew.

3185
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:28,880
Say aye.

3186
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:30,560
Aye.

3187
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:31,280
Aye.

3188
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:33,020
I think Snuffy...

3189
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:35,120
in the spirit of sloppy...

3190
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:37,020
would solo this.

3191
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:38,920
She can solo him.

3192
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:40,840
I don't think so.

3193
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:43,920
I'm only a cog in the wheel...

3194
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:45,420
that turns the sloppy machine.

3195
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:49,080
You gotta dream big, Snuffy.

3196
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:51,080
Holy shit, have you seen our bathrooms here?

3197
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:51,940
They're so big.

3198
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:53,700
That's why I was like...

3199
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:56,180
I think we'll have to...

3200
02:05:56,180 --> 02:05:57,760
clean them at some point.

3201
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:00,560
Wait, where's the bathroom?

3202
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:04,800
To the right of the restaurant.

3203
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,800
Oh my god, put all the patties in the urinals.

3204
02:06:07,420 --> 02:06:08,420
Wait, where are you guys?

3205
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:09,940
Over here.

3206
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:11,700
Over down here, yeah.

3207
02:06:12,980 --> 02:06:14,280
We're a real restaurant.

3208
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:17,100
Why is the bathroom so nice?

3209
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:19,480
Little tiny...

3210
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:21,400
Can anybody find...

3211
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:22,720
We should play hide and seek.

3212
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:26,080
Can anybody find me?

3213
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:28,620
I'm serious, though.

3214
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:29,340
Can you find me?

3215
02:06:30,180 --> 02:06:31,340
Where the fuck...

3216
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:33,100
Oh, wow.

3217
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:34,940
Great hiding spot.

3218
02:06:40,330 --> 02:06:43,150
I like how we opened...

3219
02:06:43,150 --> 02:06:45,150
We opened a brand new burger joint...

3220
02:06:45,150 --> 02:06:47,110
and it's one of the fanciest, cleanest...

3221
02:06:47,110 --> 02:06:48,590
burger joints in the entire world.

3222
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:50,610
The biggest bathrooms ever.

3223
02:06:51,050 --> 02:06:52,750
We're called Sloppies.

3224
02:06:53,390 --> 02:06:54,390
It's called Sloppies.

3225
02:06:54,550 --> 02:06:56,690
I think Sloppies is a good name.

3226
02:06:56,850 --> 02:06:59,110
It says famous sauce...

3227
02:06:59,110 --> 02:06:59,990
on the side here.

3228
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:01,850
And I'm kind of wondering...

3229
02:07:01,850 --> 02:07:02,750
Famous Sloppies sauce?

3230
02:07:04,210 --> 02:07:05,590
Famous Sloppies sauce.

3231
02:07:06,530 --> 02:07:08,330
The sloppiest of them all.

3232
02:07:08,350 --> 02:07:09,830
Big Mac and some Sloppies sauce.

3233
02:07:10,030 --> 02:07:10,550
Nice.

3234
02:07:11,070 --> 02:07:14,270
I think this is doable.

3235
02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:16,210
This is doable...

3236
02:07:16,210 --> 02:07:17,630
but I think the same people...

3237
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:19,410
who are making burgers need to be...

3238
02:07:19,990 --> 02:07:21,810
There needs to be two up front...

3239
02:07:21,810 --> 02:07:23,990
and two in the back, so to speak.

3240
02:07:24,750 --> 02:07:25,650
Yeah, but that's what we had.

3241
02:07:26,450 --> 02:07:27,210
We can't...

3242
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:29,230
We had a system that keeps track of...

3243
02:07:29,230 --> 02:07:30,930
which order we're forming to...

3244
02:07:30,930 --> 02:07:32,010
just in case we don't make the same burger.

3245
02:07:32,010 --> 02:07:34,250
Once you have two people making the burgers...

3246
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:35,630
it's just like, who's doing what now?

3247
02:07:38,570 --> 02:07:40,370
It can't be the Big Mac.

3248
02:07:40,890 --> 02:07:41,990
That's copyrighted.

3249
02:07:42,190 --> 02:07:44,430
But we can be like the Big Plap.

3250
02:07:45,450 --> 02:07:46,490
Like Big Slap.

3251
02:07:46,890 --> 02:07:48,790
I want to get the Big Plap at Sloppies.

3252
02:07:48,890 --> 02:07:49,190
Perfect.

3253
02:07:50,570 --> 02:07:52,590
You guys are genius at marketing.

3254
02:07:52,590 --> 02:07:53,230
Sloppy sauce.

3255
02:07:54,950 --> 02:07:57,350
Can we get a Big Plap meal...

3256
02:07:57,350 --> 02:07:58,950
with extra sloppy sauce on the side?

3257
02:08:02,930 --> 02:08:06,170
Is that our signature burger?

3258
02:08:06,550 --> 02:08:08,150
That's our signature burger, yeah.

3259
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:09,690
Limited time.

3260
02:08:09,930 --> 02:08:12,450
It says the big one up there, but we know the rest.

3261
02:08:16,190 --> 02:08:17,690
That's it, the Big Plap.

3262
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:25,910
Does that mean we have the quarter plappy?

3263
02:08:25,910 --> 02:08:27,270
The secret sloppy sauce.

3264
02:08:27,550 --> 02:08:28,810
The quarter plopper?

3265
02:08:30,030 --> 02:08:30,830
No!

3266
02:08:32,030 --> 02:08:33,750
Not the quarter plopper!

3267
02:08:36,390 --> 02:08:38,490
The plappy meals.

3268
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:42,590
You came up with that!

3269
02:09:02,450 --> 02:09:04,530
Welcome to Sloppies, everybody.

3270
02:09:05,410 --> 02:09:06,770
Welcome to Sloppies.

3271
02:09:06,970 --> 02:09:08,050
Welcome to Sloppies.

3272
02:09:08,050 --> 02:09:09,010
Glad to have you here.

3273
02:09:09,130 --> 02:09:10,310
Can I take your order?

3274
02:09:12,650 --> 02:09:13,170
Uh...

3275
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:16,030
Yes, I'll have a plappy meal with...

3276
02:09:16,030 --> 02:09:17,650
What kind of toy do you have today?

3277
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:25,710
I feel at home behind this counter.

3278
02:09:27,810 --> 02:09:29,090
I don't want to leave.

3279
02:09:30,770 --> 02:09:31,170
Really?

3280
02:09:31,670 --> 02:09:32,130
Yeah.

3281
02:09:32,890 --> 02:09:35,430
What are your favorite memories from Sloppies?

3282
02:09:35,430 --> 02:09:38,150
Oh my god, I've never looked at you guys' faces before.

3283
02:09:38,290 --> 02:09:39,090
This makes it worse.

3284
02:09:39,090 --> 02:09:41,050
Everyone looks so bad.

3285
02:09:42,950 --> 02:09:45,010
We look like we've been through it.

3286
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:45,010
Wait, you're smiling.

3287
02:09:45,110 --> 02:09:46,210
Why won't you look happy?

3288
02:09:46,410 --> 02:09:47,750
Well, she's usually the manager.

3289
02:09:49,010 --> 02:09:52,010
She doesn't have to do the hard work like us.

3290
02:09:52,930 --> 02:09:57,330
Mint looks like she spent the last 30 years outside and didn't apply sunscreen even once.

3291
02:09:57,590 --> 02:09:58,090
I did.

3292
02:09:58,690 --> 02:10:01,270
Mint looks like a cowboy from like 1873.

3293
02:10:03,090 --> 02:10:04,130
What do I look like?

3294
02:10:05,230 --> 02:10:06,650
You look exactly like Limon.

3295
02:10:06,650 --> 02:10:07,750
You look depressed.

3296
02:10:07,850 --> 02:10:09,790
Wait, so I look different from Limon and you?

3297
02:10:09,990 --> 02:10:12,650
Because you guys look the same, so I look different from...

3298
02:10:15,010 --> 02:10:16,250
It's the same face model.

3299
02:10:16,270 --> 02:10:17,750
They've just adjusted the skin tone.

3300
02:10:17,930 --> 02:10:20,630
I'm going to make the workplace environment really uncomfortable.

3301
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:25,110
Look in the bathroom mirror?

3302
02:10:25,270 --> 02:10:26,490
Are we all the men?

3303
02:10:26,650 --> 02:10:27,830
Am I a guy wearing a green t-shirt?

3304
02:10:27,830 --> 02:10:29,170
No, you're a lady.

3305
02:10:30,470 --> 02:10:32,430
It's two ladies, two boys.

3306
02:10:32,610 --> 02:10:32,790
What?

3307
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:33,290
Two ladies?

3308
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:34,250
What do you mean?

3309
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:35,430
Yeah, you're a lady.

3310
02:10:35,570 --> 02:10:36,390
I'm a lady?

3311
02:10:36,830 --> 02:10:37,930
Yeah, you're a lady.

3312
02:10:38,270 --> 02:10:40,050
Why did you say I was a cowboy then?

3313
02:10:41,390 --> 02:10:43,070
You can be a pretty cowboy.

3314
02:10:43,470 --> 02:10:45,130
I'm a pretty cowboy.

3315
02:10:46,850 --> 02:10:48,730
Am I a pretty cowboy?

3316
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:51,770
The prettiest.

3317
02:10:53,150 --> 02:10:55,210
The prettiest out in the west.

3318
02:10:58,150 --> 02:11:02,890
Enjoy avocado, pickles, pepper, always nice fries, premium coffee, family and friends.

3319
02:11:02,890 --> 02:11:05,250
What is this fucking word salad shit up here?

3320
02:11:05,450 --> 02:11:08,150
Avocado, pickles, pepper, sounds like a pretty cool song.

3321
02:11:08,310 --> 02:11:09,630
I thought you were about to rap.

3322
02:11:09,810 --> 02:11:17,050
Cheese, chicken, always fresh, farm, own quality, tomato, onion, potato, 100% beef, original taste, spicy salad.

3323
02:11:17,730 --> 02:11:19,010
This is the poke rap.

3324
02:11:19,250 --> 02:11:20,430
This is like the poke rap.

3325
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:26,530
Cheese, chicken, tomato, onion, delicious, always fresh, quality, farm owed.

3326
02:11:27,470 --> 02:11:28,630
You're halfway there.

3327
02:11:28,630 --> 02:11:32,630
Do you think everybody walking by just sees us jumping off the chandeliers?

3328
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:35,250
At least 150 or more to see.

3329
02:11:35,490 --> 02:11:38,630
To be a sloppy master is my destiny.

3330
02:11:39,910 --> 02:11:42,470
I don't know if I want to be a sloppy master.

3331
02:11:42,790 --> 02:11:44,090
A sloppy master.

3332
02:11:44,090 --> 02:11:46,990
To be a sloppy master is my destiny.

3333
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:48,470
I don't know about that.

3334
02:11:48,690 --> 02:11:51,590
You clap me and I clap you.

3335
02:11:58,630 --> 02:12:01,030
I think this game broke us a little bit.

3336
02:12:03,170 --> 02:12:05,850
This place has been around since 1932.

3337
02:12:06,010 --> 02:12:09,390
You guys, we are a stain on this company's history.

3338
02:12:11,550 --> 02:12:15,210
Not everybody has what it takes to open a sloppy franchise.

3339
02:12:15,730 --> 02:12:20,450
It takes a lot to be a sloppy franchise owner.

3340
02:12:20,830 --> 02:12:24,470
What if we stay open long enough there's like a Herobrine situation?

3341
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:26,810
And someone rolls up to the drive-thru.

3342
02:12:27,170 --> 02:12:29,890
The clock hasn't changed since 9pm.

3343
02:12:30,210 --> 02:12:33,210
It's like we're in a hyperbolic time chamber.

3344
02:12:33,630 --> 02:12:34,010
We're trapped.

3345
02:12:34,210 --> 02:12:38,150
We're trapped in this, nothing has moved on.

3346
02:12:39,030 --> 02:12:40,730
It's our eternal purgatory.

3347
02:12:41,790 --> 02:12:45,230
Where we keep making sloppy burgers every day.

3348
02:12:45,350 --> 02:12:46,010
Every day.

3349
02:12:46,170 --> 02:12:47,010
Every night.

3350
02:12:48,230 --> 02:12:51,390
To Snuffy, that's like her heaven right there.

3351
02:12:52,630 --> 02:12:54,010
That's like her heaven.

3352
02:12:54,190 --> 02:12:56,370
While we're trapped in the purgatory with her.

3353
02:12:57,330 --> 02:13:01,170
It's literally the episode where it's like, give it up for day 42.

3354
02:13:06,070 --> 02:13:08,590
Dave, yeah, day 42.

3355
02:13:11,970 --> 02:13:15,610
This is so if the cats jump on the counter, they get scared.

3356
02:13:17,190 --> 02:13:18,670
Wait, where are you guys?

3357
02:13:18,670 --> 02:13:20,550
Oh, you're there.

3358
02:13:23,070 --> 02:13:23,890
Lime's out here.

3359
02:13:23,990 --> 02:13:24,890
Wait, where did Mint go?

3360
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:26,770
Mint's just in there.

3361
02:13:28,250 --> 02:13:32,970
Guys, I had a great time with my sloppy employees.

3362
02:13:33,650 --> 02:13:33,830
Yeah.

3363
02:13:34,190 --> 02:13:35,270
Team Sloppy.

3364
02:13:35,410 --> 02:13:38,670
Team where we all had our own individual mental breakdowns.

3365
02:13:39,370 --> 02:13:42,090
And then a couple people tried to stage a mutiny.

3366
02:13:42,590 --> 02:13:45,510
And then, you know, one at a time got locked in the freezer.

3367
02:13:45,650 --> 02:13:46,330
Team Sloppy.

3368
02:13:46,330 --> 02:13:47,490
Team Sloppy.

3369
02:13:47,890 --> 02:13:50,250
Is that our team name?

3370
02:13:50,330 --> 02:13:50,790
Sloppy Squad?

3371
02:13:51,070 --> 02:13:51,970
Oh, Sloppy Squad.

3372
02:13:53,170 --> 02:13:54,390
The Sloppy Squad?

3373
02:13:54,770 --> 02:13:55,510
Alright, yeah.

3374
02:13:55,510 --> 02:13:56,890
We're the Slop Sisters.

3375
02:13:59,510 --> 02:14:03,170
Oh my god, why is our name getting worse?

3376
02:14:05,170 --> 02:14:08,370
We could have stopped, but we can't.

3377
02:14:11,390 --> 02:14:12,890
The Slop Sisters?

3378
02:14:13,350 --> 02:14:14,590
What is this, fucking Hamilton?

3379
02:14:20,110 --> 02:14:21,510
Slop, Slop, Slop.

3380
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:22,090
Alright.

3381
02:14:22,090 --> 02:14:23,190
The Sloppy Squad.

3382
02:14:23,310 --> 02:14:24,010
Where do we end?

3383
02:14:24,930 --> 02:14:27,730
I wanna drink out of the cups really loud like that.

3384
02:14:27,830 --> 02:14:28,590
Slop, Slop.

3385
02:14:28,690 --> 02:14:29,870
Slop, Slop, Slop.

3386
02:14:30,330 --> 02:14:31,530
Just like a cat.

3387
02:14:32,730 --> 02:14:33,790
Like a dog, really.

3388
02:14:34,130 --> 02:14:35,270
Be specific.

3389
02:14:37,670 --> 02:14:41,330
I'm so happy to be here with my Sloppy Squad.

3390
02:14:42,130 --> 02:14:44,970
And to many more Slops in the future.

3391
02:14:45,930 --> 02:14:46,790
Thank you.

3392
02:14:50,410 --> 02:14:52,730
I like how I can open this back up again.

3393
02:14:52,910 --> 02:14:55,910
Like someone's gonna just come trundling along at like...

3394
02:14:55,910 --> 02:14:56,230
9pm.

3395
02:14:56,370 --> 02:14:57,670
That's what Wendy's is for.

3396
02:14:58,490 --> 02:14:59,990
That's what Wendy's are for.

3397
02:15:00,610 --> 02:15:02,410
Always open and ready to serve.

3398
02:15:02,530 --> 02:15:03,650
No matter what time.

3399
02:15:05,050 --> 02:15:07,290
9pm is pretty early, I feel like, to close.

3400
02:15:07,290 --> 02:15:07,590
Yeah.

3401
02:15:08,170 --> 02:15:10,910
I think it's weird for Sloppies to close at 9pm.

3402
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:12,050
Yeah.

3403
02:15:12,050 --> 02:15:13,730
Yeah, somebody has a bedtime.

3404
02:15:14,010 --> 02:15:14,830
Who is it?

3405
02:15:15,070 --> 02:15:17,850
I wonder when you unlock management if you can change that.

3406
02:15:19,070 --> 02:15:19,490
Oh, Jesus.

3407
02:15:19,650 --> 02:15:21,570
They do actually have the drive-thru.

3408
02:15:21,770 --> 02:15:22,530
It just never happens.

3409
02:15:24,250 --> 02:15:26,010
It's like out of prologue thing.

3410
02:15:26,490 --> 02:15:27,310
I don't think this...

3411
02:15:27,310 --> 02:15:29,210
I don't know if this game will get out of prologue.

3412
02:15:30,930 --> 02:15:31,330
Let's...

3413
02:15:31,330 --> 02:15:34,350
Wait, do they have to drive all the way around the building to the window?

3414
02:15:35,210 --> 02:15:37,250
Yeah, they have to drive all the way here.

3415
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:38,610
All the way around, I guess, yeah.

3416
02:15:38,610 --> 02:15:38,850
And then order.

3417
02:15:39,350 --> 02:15:41,410
No, I think you can drive here.

3418
02:15:41,570 --> 02:15:42,650
No, it's right here.

3419
02:15:42,670 --> 02:15:43,970
They can do a sick U-turn right here.

3420
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:45,030
Yeah, right here.

3421
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:50,670
They come in, they do a U-turn, and then they drive through, do a U-turn.

3422
02:15:50,990 --> 02:15:52,910
Yeah, it's like an initial D.

3423
02:15:54,190 --> 02:15:56,850
Somebody in my chat said...

3424
02:15:56,850 --> 02:16:00,270
If we open a second location, we can call it Sloppy Seconds.

3425
02:16:00,270 --> 02:16:00,630
What?

3426
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:07,510
Oh my

3427
02:16:12,050 --> 02:16:14,810
gosh, eventually we'd get donuts.

3428
02:16:14,870 --> 02:16:17,030
This is like our food truck.

3429
02:16:17,970 --> 02:16:18,990
Sloppy on Wheels.

3430
02:16:20,650 --> 02:16:21,530
You know what?

3431
02:16:21,590 --> 02:16:22,290
No, that sounds like...

3432
02:16:22,290 --> 02:16:25,130
That's actually a pretty decent food truck name, not gonna lie.

3433
02:16:25,410 --> 02:16:26,430
Sloppy on Wheels.

3434
02:16:27,230 --> 02:16:28,230
Sounds good.

3435
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:31,530
Get your slop on the go.

3436
02:16:31,630 --> 02:16:32,450
We gotta...

3437
02:16:32,450 --> 02:16:34,950
We gotta copyright this right now.

3438
02:16:35,030 --> 02:16:36,210
Guys, we can't have them...

3439
02:16:36,210 --> 02:16:37,990
We can't have them take it.

3440
02:16:38,210 --> 02:16:39,530
It'll be the next big thing.

3441
02:16:39,590 --> 02:16:43,770
How about the police show up and we're just a bunch of hoodlums like drugged up in the parking lot.

3442
02:16:45,450 --> 02:16:47,190
The police are gonna come in and be like...

3443
02:16:47,190 --> 02:16:48,950
We got some calls here about some...

3444
02:16:48,950 --> 02:16:50,110
Yeah, we're just like...

3445
02:16:50,110 --> 02:16:52,410
Banging on the drive-thru window.

3446
02:16:52,850 --> 02:16:56,550
We're all just screaming sloppies.

3447
02:16:56,650 --> 02:16:56,750
Oh!

3448
02:16:57,070 --> 02:16:58,490
Did we make any money?

3449
02:16:59,330 --> 02:16:59,890
No.

3450
02:17:00,250 --> 02:17:02,010
Only $74 is what we lost.

3451
02:17:02,090 --> 02:17:02,850
That's not bad.

3452
02:17:03,370 --> 02:17:07,550
We got minus $805 popularity for opening up and just sitting here all day.

3453
02:17:07,550 --> 02:17:08,710
That might be a good thing though.

3454
02:17:08,810 --> 02:17:09,590
We didn't want that.

3455
02:17:10,090 --> 02:17:11,510
Just don't open the restaurant.

3456
02:17:11,910 --> 02:17:12,910
Don't open the restaurant.

3457
02:17:13,550 --> 02:17:14,610
Don't do it.

3458
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:15,850
Stop it, please.

3459
02:17:17,230 --> 02:17:18,530
Don't do it.

3460
02:17:20,230 --> 02:17:22,130
Without the sloppy sister.

3461
02:17:23,870 --> 02:17:24,430
Don't.

3462
02:17:24,490 --> 02:17:24,890
Stop.

3463
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:26,130
Don't.

3464
02:17:26,130 --> 02:17:28,310
Please have mercy on us.

3465
02:17:28,690 --> 02:17:32,510
I think we gotta sell the franchise before it goes bunk.

3466
02:17:32,610 --> 02:17:33,450
Do you sell high?

3467
02:17:34,190 --> 02:17:34,610
Oh, true.

3468
02:17:34,710 --> 02:17:35,170
Sell high.

3469
02:17:35,410 --> 02:17:37,150
I don't think there's any high here.

3470
02:17:37,490 --> 02:17:39,230
We failed in every metric.

3471
02:17:39,610 --> 02:17:41,310
We still have a positive rating.

3472
02:17:41,950 --> 02:17:42,930
Yeah, we're level 8.

3473
02:17:43,070 --> 02:17:44,270
Look, see?

3474
02:17:44,430 --> 02:17:45,370
They're like...

3475
02:17:45,370 --> 02:17:46,890
They're just content with us, you know?

3476
02:17:46,950 --> 02:17:48,750
They're not disappointed.

3477
02:17:48,750 --> 02:17:50,050
I don't know if that's a content face.

3478
02:17:50,230 --> 02:17:51,670
We're like an Arby's.

3479
02:17:51,670 --> 02:17:53,890
It's kind of a resignation face.

3480
02:17:53,890 --> 02:17:54,370
I have an idea.

3481
02:17:54,570 --> 02:17:55,910
You guys, we climb that mountain.

3482
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:57,370
Cause an avalanche.

3483
02:17:57,850 --> 02:17:59,230
And then we collect the insurance.

3484
02:18:01,870 --> 02:18:03,910
We collect the insurance on the building.

3485
02:18:04,090 --> 02:18:07,210
I don't think they even put that to the insurance scam back in the game.

3486
02:18:07,410 --> 02:18:11,770
I think we could dig like a crevasse underneath the building of sloppies.

3487
02:18:11,910 --> 02:18:15,190
And then it'll cave in and we can blame it on natural causes.

3488
02:18:15,430 --> 02:18:16,150
Oh, that's true.

3489
02:18:16,510 --> 02:18:18,030
Wait until there's a rainstorm.

3490
02:18:18,470 --> 02:18:19,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3491
02:18:19,550 --> 02:18:22,030
We got a sinkhole under sloppies.

3492
02:18:22,490 --> 02:18:23,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3493
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:28,930
It's like that lady on TikTok that made an underground mine before she got shut down.

3494
02:18:29,070 --> 02:18:29,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3495
02:18:31,590 --> 02:18:32,910
We can hire her.

3496
02:18:33,530 --> 02:18:34,410
We can hire her.

3497
02:18:34,490 --> 02:18:36,470
She still wants to make that mine.

3498
02:18:37,690 --> 02:18:39,450
Make the sloppy sinkhole.

3499
02:18:39,690 --> 02:18:40,490
Sloppy sinkhole.

3500
02:18:41,010 --> 02:18:41,710
Sloppy hole.

3501
02:18:45,650 --> 02:18:47,290
Trademark that, trademark that.

3502
02:18:47,290 --> 02:18:49,090
Manager, you should trademark that.

3503
02:18:49,610 --> 02:18:50,910
So they don't steal our idea.

3504
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:52,550
Guys, I'm gonna miss it here.

3505
02:18:53,010 --> 02:18:54,050
I'm gonna really miss it.

3506
02:18:55,750 --> 02:19:00,370
I'm gonna miss all the memories we have here before we burn this place down.

3507
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:03,490
Sloppy sinkhole was just my name in college.

3508
02:19:03,730 --> 02:19:04,930
I can't trademark that.

3509
02:19:08,210 --> 02:19:10,730
I need to go get something to eat.

3510
02:19:11,650 --> 02:19:13,130
Get T.T.'s.

3511
02:19:13,230 --> 02:19:13,870
T.T.

3512
02:19:13,870 --> 02:19:15,030
T .T.

3513
02:19:15,930 --> 02:19:18,530
I'll get the girls fired up.

3514
02:19:19,170 --> 02:19:20,350
Let's go.

3515
02:19:21,070 --> 02:19:22,170
Let's go.

3516
02:19:23,290 --> 02:19:24,490
Let's go.

3517
02:19:24,750 --> 02:19:24,990
Quit.

3518
02:19:26,670 --> 02:19:28,450
I just get it past that.

3519
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:31,550
No.

3520
02:19:31,550 --> 02:19:33,830
No more sloppy.

3521
02:19:33,830 --> 02:19:34,670
Oh no.

3522
02:19:36,310 --> 02:19:37,670
Sloppy's is dead forever.

3523
02:19:38,110 --> 02:19:41,090
I hope there's an update where you can dress up as the mascot.

3524
02:19:41,690 --> 02:19:42,810
I know.

3525
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:44,430
I wanna be the sign twirler.

3526
02:19:44,570 --> 02:19:46,730
Do the sign twirls and everything.

3527
02:19:47,390 --> 02:19:48,850
It's like a rhythm game.

3528
02:19:48,970 --> 02:19:50,030
You have to like...

3529
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:53,090
You're just playing a different game from us.

3530
02:19:53,410 --> 02:19:54,550
You're just...

3531
02:19:55,930 --> 02:19:58,370
We need extra hands back here.

3532
02:19:58,450 --> 02:19:59,350
There's too many ingredients.

3533
02:20:00,390 --> 02:20:01,550
I'm styling.

3534
02:20:02,110 --> 02:20:03,790
I've got my earphones in too.

3535
02:20:09,030 --> 02:20:13,290
We just hear the clickly clack of the keyboard and being like...

3536
02:20:13,290 --> 02:20:15,630
Please, we need somebody to bring these orders in.

3537
02:20:15,650 --> 02:20:16,370
And you're just like...

3538
02:20:16,370 --> 02:20:17,910
Oh, suing it up on your screen.

3539
02:20:22,570 --> 02:20:24,410
Well, that was fun, guys.

3540
02:20:26,150 --> 02:20:29,090
I had a great time with all of you guys.

3541
02:20:29,190 --> 02:20:30,010
Thanks for suggesting this.

3542
02:20:30,010 --> 02:20:30,930
I had a very good time.

3543
02:20:31,390 --> 02:20:32,230
Yeah, no problem.

3544
02:20:32,890 --> 02:20:33,530
It was...

3545
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:33,770
Bye bye.

3546
02:20:33,770 --> 02:20:34,550
By the way, guys.

3547
02:20:34,630 --> 02:20:39,350
It's not even out yet.

3548
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:40,210
What do you mean?

3549
02:20:41,930 --> 02:20:42,930
I'm so sad.

3550
02:20:43,230 --> 02:20:44,890
I like how different that was compared to...

3551
02:20:44,890 --> 02:20:46,870
Shopkeeper Sim is kind of...

3552
02:20:47,470 --> 02:20:50,190
There's stuff to do, but it's still mostly chill...

3553
02:20:50,190 --> 02:20:51,330
for a lot of levels.

3554
02:20:51,430 --> 02:20:52,790
Whereas that game was just like...

3555
02:20:52,790 --> 02:20:55,790
If you want something more than one ingredient, go fuck yourself.

3556
02:20:57,450 --> 02:20:59,770
It's actually very...

3557
02:20:59,770 --> 02:21:00,430
Very...

3558
02:21:01,590 --> 02:21:03,190
Accurate to the real thing.

3559
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:05,030
It was like Overcooked.

3560
02:21:05,110 --> 02:21:08,550
If Overcooked had no appealing art style...

3561
02:21:10,570 --> 02:21:11,930
Honestly, I think this was...

3562
02:21:12,310 --> 02:21:13,890
Much more difficult than Overcooked.

3563
02:21:15,350 --> 02:21:17,250
Oh my god, someone just...

3564
02:21:17,250 --> 02:21:18,750
In my chat was just like...

3565
02:21:18,750 --> 02:21:21,370
I played this stream over the speaker in the kitchen...

3566
02:21:21,370 --> 02:21:23,190
And we were laughing.

3567
02:21:24,010 --> 02:21:26,650
Like a real kitchen was watching us working.

3568
02:21:26,650 --> 02:21:27,190
Oh my god!

3569
02:21:27,670 --> 02:21:28,670
Oh my god.

3570
02:21:38,310 --> 02:21:40,570
But I still...I'm glad that...

3571
02:21:40,570 --> 02:21:43,010
I was able to open a fast food restaurant...

3572
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:43,830
With all of you guys.

3573
02:21:44,070 --> 02:21:45,070
The Sloppy Squad.

3574
02:21:46,390 --> 02:21:48,750
One day Sloppies will write again.

3575
02:21:48,970 --> 02:21:49,730
Yeah, one day.

3576
02:21:50,170 --> 02:21:51,830
One day we'll bring back...

3577
02:21:51,830 --> 02:21:53,750
Sloppies will come back, guys.

3578
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:55,030
Let's see what...

3579
02:21:55,030 --> 02:21:56,630
What if we had like a...

3580
02:21:56,630 --> 02:21:58,970
What if we had like a cafe collab...

3581
02:21:58,970 --> 02:22:00,570
And it was just Sloppies?

3582
02:22:00,730 --> 02:22:01,490
Oh my god.

3583
02:22:01,550 --> 02:22:04,810
Whatever we do with food...

3584
02:22:05,610 --> 02:22:07,030
It's always Sloppies.

3585
02:22:07,350 --> 02:22:08,430
Sloppies, yeah.

3586
02:22:09,290 --> 02:22:11,390
Our cafe collab is just...

3587
02:22:11,390 --> 02:22:12,730
Literally Sloppies...

3588
02:22:12,730 --> 02:22:13,670
And themed around...

3589
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:17,130
We're just doing Papa's Pizzeria, Freezeria.

3590
02:22:19,470 --> 02:22:21,750
So Sloppies under different...

3591
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:23,470
Circumstances, this is Sloppies Dessert.

3592
02:22:23,550 --> 02:22:24,650
Sloppies Dessert?

3593
02:22:25,550 --> 02:22:27,810
Okay, maybe not.

3594
02:22:28,490 --> 02:22:32,090
I mean, cha-ching.

3595
02:22:32,650 --> 02:22:33,930
Sloppies Sweets.

3596
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:37,530
Everybody would want a part of Sloppies.

3597
02:22:39,150 --> 02:22:39,990
Who's everybody?

3598
02:22:40,430 --> 02:22:42,050
Sloppies Craftery?

3599
02:22:42,290 --> 02:22:43,050
I'm that guy.

3600
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:43,550
No.

3601
02:22:43,550 --> 02:22:43,990
No.

3602
02:22:49,290 --> 02:22:52,010
But thank you everyone for...

3603
02:22:52,010 --> 02:22:53,390
Doing another collab again.

3604
02:22:53,630 --> 02:22:54,470
It was really fun.

3605
02:22:55,250 --> 02:22:57,130
Thank you for inviting.

3606
02:22:57,610 --> 02:22:59,350
My mind is always a bug with you guys.

3607
02:22:59,490 --> 02:22:59,790
Thank you.

3608
02:23:01,310 --> 02:23:03,490
I feel like next time...

3609
02:23:03,490 --> 02:23:05,630
We should just hang out and talk on stream.

3610
02:23:05,850 --> 02:23:07,950
Because I feel like...

3611
02:23:07,950 --> 02:23:09,750
I feel like...

3612
02:23:09,750 --> 02:23:11,190
Think of something that we can play...

3613
02:23:11,190 --> 02:23:12,870
In the background really idly.

3614
02:23:13,270 --> 02:23:13,630
If anything.

3615
02:23:15,130 --> 02:23:17,850
Something that you can play.

3616
02:23:18,190 --> 02:23:19,050
Maybe involving fishing.

3617
02:23:19,510 --> 02:23:20,510
With your friends on the web.

3618
02:23:20,730 --> 02:23:21,090
I don't know.

3619
02:23:23,330 --> 02:23:24,210
Oh yeah, the we...

3620
02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:26,870
The we fishing or whatever.

3621
02:23:27,330 --> 02:23:28,210
Web fishing.

3622
02:23:28,550 --> 02:23:30,190
I was playing it yesterday.

3623
02:23:30,590 --> 02:23:31,570
It's really chill.

3624
02:23:32,370 --> 02:23:33,870
You should try it.

3625
02:23:33,950 --> 02:23:35,010
It's actually really chill.

3626
02:23:35,150 --> 02:23:35,530
Is it fun?

3627
02:23:35,610 --> 02:23:36,310
Okay, I'll try.

3628
02:23:36,390 --> 02:23:38,710
It's basically like Animal Crossing fishing.

3629
02:23:38,710 --> 02:23:41,010
But they remove everything else.

3630
02:23:41,290 --> 02:23:41,990
And it's just fishing.

3631
02:23:43,070 --> 02:23:45,010
It's just the fishing part of Animal Crossing.

3632
02:23:45,310 --> 02:23:47,930
So you can shitpost at your friends at the same time.

3633
02:23:50,690 --> 02:23:51,290
Yeah.

3634
02:23:52,270 --> 02:23:54,110
Do you like any VR collabs?

3635
02:23:54,810 --> 02:23:55,950
Oh yeah.

3636
02:23:56,770 --> 02:23:58,310
We should do VR together.

3637
02:23:59,610 --> 02:24:01,790
Snuffy knows all about VR stuff.

3638
02:24:01,950 --> 02:24:03,590
You can give us a tour.

3639
02:24:03,950 --> 02:24:05,230
Show us your favorite worlds.

3640
02:24:05,230 --> 02:24:05,650
Yeah.

3641
02:24:06,630 --> 02:24:08,970
There's a ton of Halloween stuff to you that's scary.

3642
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:12,070
Wait, scary?

3643
02:24:12,070 --> 02:24:15,630
I need to poke you about something in regards to that Snuffy.

3644
02:24:15,730 --> 02:24:16,650
I will message you after.

3645
02:24:17,030 --> 02:24:18,130
Oh, secret.

3646
02:24:18,250 --> 02:24:19,530
I want to be involved.

3647
02:24:20,730 --> 02:24:21,410
That's fine.

3648
02:24:21,490 --> 02:24:22,430
I'll poke everybody.

3649
02:24:28,370 --> 02:24:31,310
It is very easy to get me to just be like...

3650
02:24:31,310 --> 02:24:31,970
You want to know too?

3651
02:24:32,110 --> 02:24:32,750
Okay, I'll tell you.

3652
02:24:32,750 --> 02:24:32,830
Yeah.

3653
02:24:33,290 --> 02:24:34,870
We want to know.

3654
02:24:36,350 --> 02:24:37,590
Get excited.

3655
02:24:38,430 --> 02:24:39,230
Cool.

3656
02:24:40,290 --> 02:24:41,410
Okay, well thank you guys.

3657
02:24:41,490 --> 02:24:42,830
Teaching everybody.

3658
02:24:43,510 --> 02:24:45,530
See you guys later.

3659
02:24:46,670 --> 02:24:47,890
Bye-bye.

3660
02:24:48,490 --> 02:24:48,870
Bye-bye.

3661
02:24:57,230 --> 02:24:58,030
Guys...

3662
02:24:58,030 --> 02:25:00,910
My brain is literally sloppy right now.

3663
02:25:02,090 --> 02:25:05,010
My brain is...

3664
02:25:08,950 --> 02:25:10,710
I can't even think.

3665
02:25:11,930 --> 02:25:13,730
My brain is mush.

3666
02:25:14,450 --> 02:25:15,970
What a crazy...

3667
02:25:15,970 --> 02:25:16,790
Oh my god.

3668
02:25:22,970 --> 02:25:24,510
I'm exhausted from laughing.

3669
02:25:24,690 --> 02:25:26,670
I'm glad you guys thought it was funny.

3670
02:25:27,310 --> 02:25:28,080
I hope you guys...

3671
02:25:28,850 --> 02:25:29,550
Had fun.

3672
02:25:30,550 --> 02:25:30,930
Me?

3673
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:33,670
I'm gonna go eat...

3674
02:25:33,670 --> 02:25:33,950
Dinner.

3675
02:25:34,990 --> 02:25:36,630
Oh my gosh, it's so early.

3676
02:25:37,010 --> 02:25:37,450
Wow.

3677
02:25:38,270 --> 02:25:39,450
Wasn't that long of a collab.

3678
02:25:39,670 --> 02:25:41,750
But that's okay, because it was craziness.

3679
02:25:42,410 --> 02:25:43,830
I was crying from laughing.

3680
02:25:48,250 --> 02:25:49,790
We didn't make it to level 10.

3681
02:25:49,850 --> 02:25:52,390
But thank god we didn't make it to level 10.

3682
02:25:55,890 --> 02:25:58,270
Oh my gosh, I've worked fast food before.

3683
02:25:58,490 --> 02:25:59,650
I worked at a Wendy's.

3684
02:25:59,650 --> 02:26:01,010
I worked...

3685
02:26:01,770 --> 02:26:04,390
I worked like third shift or whatever.

3686
02:26:04,590 --> 02:26:05,930
So it was like...

3687
02:26:05,930 --> 02:26:06,750
It was like...

3688
02:26:07,590 --> 02:26:09,530
6pm to 3am or something.

3689
02:26:10,910 --> 02:26:13,150
I got PTSD from when I worked at Tim Horton's.

3690
02:26:13,170 --> 02:26:14,990
5 out of 5 would eat at Sloppy's again.

3691
02:26:15,850 --> 02:26:16,350
Would you actually?

3692
02:26:16,450 --> 02:26:17,290
Yeah, I did.

3693
02:26:19,550 --> 02:26:21,410
It was so awful.

3694
02:26:22,030 --> 02:26:23,090
I would...

3695
02:26:24,090 --> 02:26:25,130
Thank you!

3696
02:26:25,850 --> 02:26:27,610
Sorry if you guys were sending stuff.

3697
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:29,490
And I couldn't see, but thank you.

3698
02:26:29,610 --> 02:26:31,470
That collab was incredible and re-traumatizing.

3699
02:26:31,530 --> 02:26:32,150
It was.

3700
02:26:34,290 --> 02:26:36,010
Night shift closers represent.

3701
02:26:36,510 --> 02:26:38,110
Yeah, and then...

3702
02:26:38,110 --> 02:26:38,790
My...

3703
02:26:38,790 --> 02:26:41,170
So I wasn't properly trained on the register.

3704
02:26:42,230 --> 02:26:42,730
So...

3705
02:26:42,730 --> 02:26:45,250
I had a lot of anxiety that if...

3706
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:47,270
I made a mistake when someone was ordering.

3707
02:26:47,390 --> 02:26:48,790
Or if they wanted to change an order.

3708
02:26:48,970 --> 02:26:50,270
I like, couldn't.

3709
02:26:50,610 --> 02:26:55,050
So I never was taught how.

3710
02:26:59,430 --> 02:27:00,230
And so...

3711
02:27:07,130 --> 02:27:09,310
So I wouldn't change their order.

3712
02:27:10,130 --> 02:27:12,670
And then, they would get up to the thing.

3713
02:27:12,830 --> 02:27:13,750
And they would be like...

3714
02:27:13,750 --> 02:27:15,550
Oh, this is my order.

3715
02:27:16,810 --> 02:27:18,270
Or they'd be like, is this your order?

3716
02:27:18,350 --> 02:27:19,950
And they'd be like, oh, I changed this.

3717
02:27:20,350 --> 02:27:21,650
And then they would be like...

3718
02:27:21,650 --> 02:27:23,050
Oh, okay.

3719
02:27:24,290 --> 02:27:25,310
We'll fix it.

3720
02:27:27,610 --> 02:27:29,250
And then, at the end of the night.

3721
02:27:30,750 --> 02:27:32,130
Everybody would leave.

3722
02:27:32,710 --> 02:27:34,750
And have me finish closing up.

3723
02:27:40,230 --> 02:27:40,950
I was...

3724
02:27:40,950 --> 02:27:43,130
I was not just register though.

3725
02:27:43,230 --> 02:27:44,750
I was back register and dishes.

3726
02:27:46,250 --> 02:27:47,970
So I was also washing the dishes.

3727
02:27:48,250 --> 02:27:49,250
And it would be like...

3728
02:27:49,250 --> 02:27:52,170
At night, I would have to wash the huge thing.

3729
02:27:52,630 --> 02:27:54,550
That like, all the fries were in.

3730
02:27:55,010 --> 02:27:56,830
And it was big and heavy.

3731
02:27:57,010 --> 02:27:58,890
And I couldn't properly wash it.

3732
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:01,050
It was so bad.

3733
02:28:02,330 --> 02:28:05,350
This is reinforced why I no longer work fast food service.

3734
02:28:05,970 --> 02:28:08,430
Did they find your stash of burgers at the counter?

3735
02:28:11,150 --> 02:28:11,630
Oh,

3736
02:28:14,890 --> 02:28:15,350
yeah.

3737
02:28:16,150 --> 02:28:17,310
That thing is a pain to wash.

3738
02:28:17,470 --> 02:28:18,330
It's so awful.

3739
02:28:18,590 --> 02:28:20,630
Cleaning the grease vat at closing was so gross.

3740
02:28:20,790 --> 02:28:23,110
I know, it made me feel so awful.

3741
02:28:24,810 --> 02:28:26,610
And then, after I worked there.

3742
02:28:26,730 --> 02:28:27,650
I worked at a different...

3743
02:28:27,650 --> 02:28:28,990
It wasn't quite fast food.

3744
02:28:28,990 --> 02:28:30,650
But I worked at a different...

3745
02:28:30,650 --> 02:28:33,410
I worked at another food place.

3746
02:28:34,070 --> 02:28:35,870
Called in today because I had a horrid day yesterday.

3747
02:28:35,970 --> 02:28:37,350
And I do work at food service.

3748
02:28:37,650 --> 02:28:39,770
This is way too accurate, but y'all tune it up.

3749
02:28:40,370 --> 02:28:41,090
Sorry, Teresa.

3750
02:28:41,890 --> 02:28:42,250
Sorry.

3751
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:45,770
When they were like, number 5, this is for table 5.

3752
02:28:45,870 --> 02:28:47,170
I was like, losing my mind.

3753
02:28:47,230 --> 02:28:48,210
I was like, this is too real.

3754
02:28:48,590 --> 02:28:49,470
This is too real.

3755
02:28:50,350 --> 02:28:51,290
Like a chain restaurant.

3756
02:28:53,230 --> 02:28:54,930
It was, kind of.

3757
02:28:56,770 --> 02:28:58,170
It was like...

3758
02:28:58,610 --> 02:29:00,650
It was like pseudo fast food.

3759
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:01,430
You know what I mean?

3760
02:29:03,070 --> 02:29:05,450
But it is like a nationwide chain.

3761
02:29:05,590 --> 02:29:05,870
I don't know.

3762
02:29:05,950 --> 02:29:06,530
I don't feel it.

3763
02:29:06,570 --> 02:29:07,010
I don't know why.

3764
02:29:07,150 --> 02:29:08,270
I don't want to say it.

3765
02:29:08,710 --> 02:29:11,770
I don't want to give up my whole work experience.

3766
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:14,430
Fast casual.

3767
02:29:15,030 --> 02:29:16,150
Wait, is that a real word?

3768
02:29:22,870 --> 02:29:23,550
Not hooters.

3769
02:29:23,550 --> 02:29:25,530
I've never even been to a hooters before.

3770
02:29:26,890 --> 02:29:28,230
I once went to one.

3771
02:29:28,830 --> 02:29:29,970
And they were really busy.

3772
02:29:30,310 --> 02:29:31,950
And I remember seeing a girl in the back.

3773
02:29:32,050 --> 02:29:33,550
With the fattest hooters.

3774
02:29:33,870 --> 02:29:35,570
And I was like, please, can we stay?

3775
02:29:35,890 --> 02:29:37,110
But they were just so busy.

3776
02:29:37,190 --> 02:29:39,490
And we wouldn't get a table for a really long time.

3777
02:29:40,830 --> 02:29:41,250
So...

3778
02:29:41,250 --> 02:29:42,230
I was so sad.

3779
02:29:47,910 --> 02:29:48,970
Woah, mama.

3780
02:29:49,970 --> 02:29:51,170
Anyways, I'm so sorry.

3781
02:29:51,170 --> 02:29:53,370
You guys, usually in these kinds of collabs...

3782
02:29:53,790 --> 02:29:55,430
I'm able to look at chat...

3783
02:29:55,430 --> 02:29:56,470
Even just a little bit.

3784
02:29:57,230 --> 02:29:58,950
But for this...

3785
02:29:58,950 --> 02:30:02,150
I was totally focused on the game.

3786
02:30:02,630 --> 02:30:03,790
So I'm so sorry.

3787
02:30:05,050 --> 02:30:07,010
But hopefully you guys still have fun.

3788
02:30:07,450 --> 02:30:08,350
And everything.

3789
02:30:08,710 --> 02:30:09,890
I had a lot of fun.

3790
02:30:12,190 --> 02:30:12,750
Sloppies.

3791
02:30:14,550 --> 02:30:15,670
So sloppies.

3792
02:30:18,110 --> 02:30:19,990
It was a fast food trauma.

3793
02:30:19,990 --> 02:30:21,130
It truly was.

3794
02:30:21,590 --> 02:30:25,430
Hooters is America's version of Japan's maid cafe.

3795
02:30:27,170 --> 02:30:28,230
That's why I have to go.

3796
02:30:28,350 --> 02:30:29,770
Do they do checkies at Hooters?

3797
02:30:30,010 --> 02:30:33,550
If I brought my checkie camera, would they do a checkie with me?

3798
02:30:41,010 --> 02:30:42,410
Sloppies is second to none.

3799
02:30:42,790 --> 02:30:44,050
Exactly, exactly.

3800
02:30:58,120 --> 02:30:58,720
Okidoki.

3801
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:01,680
Well guys, I think I'm gonna head out now.

3802
02:31:02,460 --> 02:31:03,780
You guys have a sloppy day?

3803
02:31:04,140 --> 02:31:04,680
Sloppy night?

3804
02:31:08,100 --> 02:31:11,080
I'm really in the mood for a sloppy joe now.

3805
02:31:11,340 --> 02:31:13,980
I've been thinking about it the whole time.

3806
02:31:18,940 --> 02:31:21,220
Thanks for the sloppy good collab.

3807
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:22,800
Thank you guys.

3808
02:31:24,060 --> 02:31:25,260
Hell yeah.

3809
02:31:25,260 --> 02:31:26,740
Sloppy joe.

3810
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:30,200
Go grab a berg.

3811
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:32,440
I don't think I'll get a berg, but...

3812
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:33,390
I can like smell...

3813
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:35,580
I could smell this collab.

3814
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:38,500
Thanks for the streaming though.

3815
02:31:38,580 --> 02:31:39,460
Thanks for watching!

3816
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:43,820
This brought back a whole lot of PTSD of my minimum wage days.

3817
02:31:43,880 --> 02:31:45,540
So I'm grateful for my office job now.

3818
02:31:46,140 --> 02:31:46,580
Yes.

3819
02:31:47,060 --> 02:31:49,400
And if you work in food service now...

3820
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:52,040
It can always get better.

3821
02:31:53,960 --> 02:31:54,520
Or...

3822
02:31:54,520 --> 02:31:55,880
You're out of sloppies.

3823
02:31:56,900 --> 02:31:57,800
Try to print this.

3824
02:31:57,880 --> 02:31:58,200
Thank you.

3825
02:31:58,740 --> 02:31:59,580
Thanks guys!

3826
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:00,680
Otsu minto!

3827
02:32:01,780 --> 02:32:02,620
Otsu bastion!

3828
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,340
And see you guys not tomorrow.

3829
02:32:04,460 --> 02:32:06,040
I'm not streaming tomorrow, but I'll see you guys...

3830
02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:08,080
When I see you!

3831
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:12,140
Otsu minto!

3832
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:12,880
Bye bye!

3833
02:32:12,980 --> 02:32:13,480
Thank you guys!

3834
02:32:13,660 --> 02:32:15,580
See you!

3835
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,100
Thanks for the 20k thread!

3836
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:21,260
Thank you so much!

3837
02:32:21,700 --> 02:32:22,320
Bye bye!
