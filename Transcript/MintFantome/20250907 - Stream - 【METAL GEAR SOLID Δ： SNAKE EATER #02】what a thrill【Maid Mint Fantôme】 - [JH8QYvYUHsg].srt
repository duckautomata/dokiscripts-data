00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,710
Hello gamers!

2
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,470
Oh my god.

3
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:24,570
Oh my god.

4
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,830
Why did I get a cough drop?

5
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,390
I think it was the coffee.

6
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:29,890
Oh.

7
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:33,810
Nope.

8
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,570
Nummy.

9
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,260
Coffee.

10
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,780
I had coffee because I woke up early.

11
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,800
Well, I didn't really wake up that early this morning.

12
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,400
But I had two me and greets.

13
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,740
I was at Vexpo and now here I am.

14
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,240
Wait, let me move my cursor.

15
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:54,860
There we go.

16
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,500
Playing Metal Gear Solid Delta.

17
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,080
Yeah, I think that I can use...

18
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,660
I think I don't have to be Chibi Minto.

19
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,200
So far, so good.

20
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:09,880
I don't think...

21
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,520
Can I sing along?

22
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,680
Can we do a sing along real quick?

23
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,320
Wait.

24
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,660
What did I do with the wrap?

25
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,200
for her.

26
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,520
Wait, did I throw it away?

27
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,170
With darkness and silence through the night.

28
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,390
I love this part.

29
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,370
What a thrill.

30
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,990
She's so into it.

31
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:40,970
I love it.

32
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,190
I'm searching and I'll melt into you.

33
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,310
What a fear in my heart.

34
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,630
But you're so supreme.

35
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,790
In

36
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:18,520
my time, there'll be no one else.

37
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,200
Crime, it's the way I fly to you.

38
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:38,340
I'm still in a dream, snake eat up.

39
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,900
Please sleep.

40
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,320
Someday you go through the rain.

41
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,600
Oh gosh, we're about to go against the fear, huh?

42
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,860
And someday you'll plead on a tree frog.

43
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,160
This ordeal, the trial to survive.

44
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,880
We see new life.

45
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:24,380
In my time, there'll be no one else.

46
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,960
Crime, it's the way I fight to you.

47
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,520
I'm still in a dream.

48
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,160
Snake eater

49
00:05:50,980 --> 00:06:00,500
I'm still in a dream Snake eater Bye bye bye

50
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:22,060
Yeah baby, yeah baby, yeah baby Yeah, baby, yeah baby, yeah baby shows that we're in the Grinini Gorky.

51
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,400
Wait.

52
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,260
Oh, I am still in Grinini Gorky.

53
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,560
I forgot.

54
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,440
Having fun with my playthrough.

55
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,200
Thank you!

56
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,860
See what I'm doing.

57
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,240
I got around to playing MGS 1 and 2 so I could play Delta.

58
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:37,820
Ooh!

59
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,600
Nice.

60
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,780
Cynthia the Go.

61
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,800
I saw someone.

62
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,460
Yeah, I went on a rampage.

63
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,700
No, that didn't save, though.

64
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,520
I don't.

65
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,680
I don't think so.

66
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,840
But, um, I saw a...

67
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:57,460
I saw, um, someone, while the song was happening, being like, these lyrics don't make much sense.

68
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,680
Yes, they do.

69
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,660
Yes, they do.

70
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,560
It's literally a song, The Boss to Snake.

71
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,380
They make the most sense.

72
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,440
Someday you do feed on a tree frog.

73
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,040
It's in the game!

74
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,820
That's life, baby!

75
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,540
This ordeal, the trial, to survive!

76
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,620
I mean, when I take the lyrics, literally.

77
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,760
I think actually the song, like, makes the most sense.

78
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,300
I'll take your word for it.

79
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,480
It's in there!

80
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,280
Okay, let me take my...

81
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,640
Let me eat my cough drop again.

82
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:58,940
Cool!

83
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,860
Um, we just...

84
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,500
We just said nice shoes.

85
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,360
And now we, um...

86
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,520
We are continuing onward.

87
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,040
I'm actually surprised you saw my comment.

88
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,240
I read a little bit.

89
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:44,760

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,180
Do you hear me?

92
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,580
Of course!

93
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,520
But, um...

94
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,080
Eight hours streaming coming.

95
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,200
I really don't know, I really can't say.

96
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,060
I'm just gonna, like I said, I'm gonna play for however long I want to.

97
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,700
I'd like to get...

98
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,060
I'm not gonna say, because I don't wanna...

99
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,420
I don't wanna... I don't wanna... What's the word?

100
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,360
I don't wanna think about it.

101
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,620
Cody!

102
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,800
Happy early birthday, happy early birthday!

103
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,100
Sneeter button is R1.

104
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,720
Oh, wait, really?

105
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,320
Should I load again?

106
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,160
Probably continue is fine.

107
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,740
My last save point.

108
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,100
This is probably fine.

109
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,940
Okay, okay, we're fine, we're fine.

110
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,620
My murderous rampage is over.

111
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:56,860
Wait.

112
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,740
It is over, right?

113
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,800
Oh, okay, wait, hold on, I have to remember the controls again.

114
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,420
This is, okay, there we go.

115
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,360
Let's put on our, we got our glasses.

116
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Let's put on our scientist outfit.

117
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,320
Turn it up a little bit.

118
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,300
I want it blasting in my ears.

119
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,860
Okay, sorry, okay.

120
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,760
Oh!

121
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,720
Come on, sit in here!

122
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,900
Oh, nasty snake!

123
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,760
Okay.

124
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,360
I think if we just run through here, we'll be fine.

125
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,120
Oh gosh.

126
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,400
Don't notice me?

127
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,360
Don't notice me?

128
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,580
Run away?

129
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,240
Go away?

130
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:58,940
Yeah?

131
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,200
Okay, sit down.

132
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:01,640
Oh!

133
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,080
Oh!

134
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,020
How did they all notice me, I was?

135
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,960
Wait, wait, get up, get up, stick.

136
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,160
Wait, how do I...

137
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,740
Oh my god.

138
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,840
Wait, I'm trying to get into the menu so I can change out of my clothes.

139
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,900
Oh, it won't let me into the menu!

140
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,700
Wait, can you not go into the menu when you're...

141
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,460
How do they know?

142
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,360
Okay.

143
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,580
Oh.

144
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,800
Wait, I want to put on my hat.

145
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,640
How do I...

146
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,300
Oh, that's cute.

147
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,400
I'm suffering from a deep cut, everybody.

148
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,920
I'm very offended.

149
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,400
How did they know so fast?

150
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,660
Where's my bleeding?

151
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,550
Oh, here we go.

152
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:53,700
Oh.

153
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,330
Let me put on my hat.

154
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:02,950
Is it...

155
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,250
Oh, no.

156
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,130
I have to equip it.

157
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,530
That's right.

158
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:07,710
Oh.

159
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,630
Oh, gosh.

160
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,790
Wait, I don't remember the controls.

161
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,890
Wait, how do I equip anything?

162
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:15,630
Oh my gosh.

163
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,810
Why can't I remember the controls anymore?

164
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,170
Hold on, please!

165
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:20,970
Ow!

166
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,800
Oh, well.

167
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,680
Okay, hold on.

168
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,580
Everybody, please!

169
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,760
My buttons aren't working!

170
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,660
Is it R?

171
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,400
It's on the T-pad.

172
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,140
Okay, anyway, we're fine.

173
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,480
I remember

174
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,040
everything now?

175
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,650
All I need to do is leave?

176
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,330
No?

177
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,650
Help me!

178
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,810
Oh, oh, shoot.

179
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,810
Oh, come on, good up, Snake.

180
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,430
Okay, good warm-up, everybody.

181
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,710
Where is it start me at?

182
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,610
No, kidding!

183
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,530
Wow.

184
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,250
Okay, wait, this is actually awesome.

185
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,810
Let's go back to being a scientist.

186
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,070

199
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,720

It's all right!

204
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,240
The calorie mate's good though.

205
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,300
Good old calorie mate.

206
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,080

208
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,160
Oops, I'll rot in.

209
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,640
Oh my gosh, you guys.

210
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,120
Why can't I remember where to go?

211
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,180
Do I need to just...

212
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,420
Where was it?

213
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,860
Is it where I came from?

214
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,680
I want some more.

215
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,760
Let's go where I came from.

216
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,620
What a lovely day.

217
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,640
It'll be a crocodile.

218
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:27,560
Whenever I think about the non-lethal train, I think about the poor guards you accidentally hit in the iron mouth while yawning.

219
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,520
I don't.

220
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,360
I don't think about that at all.

221
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,140
Granini Gorky.

222
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,140
Such a fun name to say.

223
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,840
Is there a guy over here?

224
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,440
Am I crazy?

225
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,240
I am the most stealth man ever though right now.

226
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,420
a crocodile there's no way they can know

227
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:08,830
two seconds before they know oh no no oh I bet that is a joke

228
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,480
this crocodile is ah don't yeah a red and yellow friend of fellow

229
00:18:40,260 --> 00:19:30,880
this dog i don't think he's gonna care about me at all because i have a croc hat on don't care about me dog oh but this guy i think he's gonna notice me i have 80 90 percent there's no way yeah whatever wait he might see me if i'm walking though there's an achievement for getting over a hundred percent or is it a hundred percent stealth I kind of want it does that croc have a gun I don't have the gun also I think they would do that it's a new Russian experiment crocs with guns I think it's actually very something that they would do

230
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,370
no you don't think It's advanced!

231
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,270
Nobody would want to mess with a crocodile, with a gun!

232
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,300
Me being like...

233
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,260
Me being like, oh my gosh, how did they know last time I streamed this game?

234
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,780
When I was like, hey, oh my gosh, look at the little leaf covering his nip.

235
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,880
Look, do you see it?

236
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,440
Wait, zoom in.

237
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,100
Enhanced?

238
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,760
Not his crotch?

239
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:07,900
There we go.

240
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,380
Oh, it's gone!

241
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,020
Why does this keep happening to me?

242
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,980
Anyway, it got clipped from me being like, how would they know that I'm a crocodile?

243
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,660
Because I look so much like a crocodile.

244
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,180
And people were like, it's because she said crocodile.

245
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,900
And not this very, this other, whatever the gator is actually called.

246
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,900
Not gator, you know what I mean.

247
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,180
Whatever he's at.

248
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,280
The long snout.

249
00:20:38,300 --> 00:21:07,660

250
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,180
I have a secret to tell you guys.

251
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,520
I ended last stream where I did because I didn't want to fight the fear.

252
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,180
I was like, I don't think I'm ready to deal with this guy right now.

253
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,520
Knew it!

254
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,780
I was like, I don't think I want to fight the fear right now.

255
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,220
That's my secret.

256
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,300
Come on, Crock, you got this!

257
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,080
Oh, whoa, with the stout going.

258
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:52,910
Yeah!

259
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,950
First boss, did you forget about the pain?

260
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,770
What about...

261
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,970
What about us a lot?

262
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,850
Oh, my God.

263
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,730
Your limbs will be paralyzed.

264
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,090
Your lungs...

265
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,090
What about my snout?

266
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,410
Ah, what a fun with that.

267
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,980
Hey, uh, step out of it.

268
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,050
The boss is the apprentice.

269
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,470
I will give you fear such as you've never experienced before.

270
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,830
Come into my web.

271
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:42,530
Whoa.

272
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,710
I hate what he does.

273
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,790
Are you ready to kill me?

274
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:46,540

I'm suffering from venom poisoning.

280
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,180
I might actually die.

281
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,900
So what, I have to...

282
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,120

283
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,820
Serum.

284
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,660
And then we gotta get the bolt out.

285
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,440
There it is.

286
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,820
Okay, and we're bleeding.

287
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,800
And we're disinfecting.

00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,120

00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,140
Ah, this...

293
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,320
I used two on action.

294
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,680
I can't read.

295
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,020
Oh, gotcha.

296
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:06,960
Okay.

297
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,020
Actually, kind of...

298
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,620
Oh, I...

299
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,700

00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,960
Oh, gee, I'll just...

301
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,360
I'll just...

302
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,480
Oh, I can't hit either.

303
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,400
Okay, I got him.

304
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,220
He's actually quite easy to see.

305
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,740
Oh, I say that, and now I lost him.

306
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,880
He's good.

307
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,860
Oh, boy, yeah.

308
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,160
Are you still there?

309
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:38,460
Okay.

310
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,320
Yeah.

311
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,280
It's actually, like, so easy to see.

312
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,100
Like, it's actually so easy to see.

313
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,020
Okay, monkey.

314
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,240
Yeah, actually.

315
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,620
Okay.

316
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,900
Wait, this is way too easy, I fear.

317
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,320
Wait, it's...

318
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,880
Oh, you!

319
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,540
Ah!

320
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,240
Shoot.

321
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,540
Oh, he's gone.

322
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,320
It's like so...

323
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,100
Wait, it's actually so easy.

324
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,820
How did I get hit?

325
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,000
Uh, uh, uh, disinfect.

326
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,140
Oh, we're fine.

327
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,520
Okay.

328
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,320
I don't want to get...

329
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,500
Wait, okay, how do I do?

330
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,880
Okay, photo mode.

331
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,240
Oh wait, um, where's my...

332
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,800
Where's, uh...

333
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,820
Let's see.

334
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,780
In my backpack.

335
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,780
Let's give him a...

336
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,720
How do I throw the food?

337
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,340
Wait, let's give him like a poison dart frog.

338
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,640
No, no, no.

339
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,980
Uh, add to my backpack.

340
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,540
Oh, it's probably under a weapon.

341
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:10,920
There we go.

342
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:11,480
Okay.

343
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,580
We'll give them a bat.

344
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,090
We're just gonna give the guy a bat.

345
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,290
There you go.

346
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,270
Hungry.

347
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,630
Hungry?

348
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:25,770
Hungry?

349
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,410
Eat that!

350
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,650
No, no, no, mister!

351
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:29,810
Wait.

352
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,950
This might be a great time to take a photo.

353
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:35,310
Woo!

354
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:42,350
Yeah!

355
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,410
Here we go.

356
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,210
It's so good.

357
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:50,630
Wow!

358
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,810
Wait, this is so awesome!

359
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,750
I've been meaning to take more photos.

360
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,090
But I keep forgetting.

361
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,170
Um.

362
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,130
Oh, here we go.

363
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,450
Hide.

364
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,750
What is it?

365
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,110
F12?

366
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,450
There we go.

367
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,070
Yeah!

368
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,910
Wait, this is so good!

369
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,860
my spit wrong.

370
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,420
I'm fine.

371
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,760
Okay.

372
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,600
We're fine.

373
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,200
I've been wanting to take more photos, though.

374
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,260
You think he'll eat that, or...

375
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,960
Wait, what's that?

376
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,820
That's not mine.

377
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:36,980
Oh.

378
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,040
Yes!

379
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,660
You ate it!

380
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,160
Stupid!

381
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,540
Dummy!

382
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,920
Wait, I'm hungry.

383
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,680
Or is that him?

384
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,060
What is mine at?

385
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,780
No, I'm thinking I'm fine.

386
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,140
Did he just throw it up?

387
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,400
Oh my gosh, he scared me now.

388
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,140
He's so fast.

389
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,480
He's...

390
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,300
He's so stinking fast.

391
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,160
Oh.

392
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,280
Oh, did I get him?

393
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,580
Oh, I did.

394
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:21,960
Nice.

395
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,220
This fight is like crazy easy.

396
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,220
I don't know what I was worried about.

397
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:37,920
I was worried that he would be easy to see in the...

398
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,240
Actually, I don't know where he is now.

399
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,340
In the high death, you know.

400
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,560
Oh, oh, oh my gosh.

401
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,960
Oh, now he's back to normal.

402
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,080
Wait, ah.

403
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,580
Oh, come on, Snake!

404
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:51,960
Hurry up!

405
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,300
Oh!

406
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,560
Where is he?

407
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,380
I don't know where he went.

408
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,460
Oh, no, I lost him.

409
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,110
Ah, I'm trying to leave.

410
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
I lost him, though.

411
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,260
Oh, there he is.

412
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,700
Oh, I just lost him.

413
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,740
I lost him.

414
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,200
There he is.

415
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,720
Oh, now he recovered!

416
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,060
I just noticed.

417
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,120
Oh, my God.

418
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,400
He healed.

419
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,920
Ah, it was too late.

420
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,660
You bastard.

421
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:29,960
Wait, where are you?

422
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:30,840
Oh, my gosh.

423
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,340
Don't you.

424
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,220
Oh, he's healed so much!

425
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,680
Oh, God.

426
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,980
Everything is bad.

427
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,720
I'm too slow.

428
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,880
Where is he?

429
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,180
It was supposed to be easy.

430
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,800
Wait, I have so much...

431
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,500
Oh, wrong button.

432
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,940
I have so much bad food.

433
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,620
Let's, like, put it all in here.

434
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,680
All in, baby.

435
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,300
All in.

436
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,910
Okay, all my bad food for him.

437
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,750
Russian bat...

438
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,770
Everything, everything is nasty.

439
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,270
Everything is bad.

440
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,370
No, my glow caps!

441
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,090
It's a food fight, yeah.

442
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,290
If food is what he wants, food is what he'll get.

443
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:23,490
Ah!

444
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:24,930
Ah!

445
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,050
Ah!

446
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:26,490
Ah!

447
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,530
Ah!

448
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,870
I'm still burned.

449
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,450
I have more arrows in the head?

450
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,830
Holy cow.

451
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,810
How am I alive?

452
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:02,910
OP.

453
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,490
Snake has protag power.

454
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,290
Holy cow.

455
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,570
Let's eat another.

456
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,730
When did I get this frog?

457
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,750
Yep, loco maloco.

458
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,330
We'll eat it.

459
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,330
His skull is just that thick.

460
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,130
It's true.

461
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,630
Yaboko and mimoko.

462
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:28,890
Yaboko.

463
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:32,350
Ah!

464
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,850
Dang, we were so close.

465
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,110
I was like literally one hit away.

466
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,010
Oh well.

467
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:36,810
That's fine.

468
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,270
I might die.

469
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,550
If so, I don't care.

470
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,750
Oh, uh, let's throw our bat.

471
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,980
I got my bat.

472
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,200
I got my bat!

473
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,320
Wait.

474
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,140
Oh, I have to...

475
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,980
Dang it, I have to throw him back into my...

476
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,480
We're, like, not really doing well.

477
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,180
Oh,

478
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:08,700
my gosh.

479
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,880
If I could aim, it would be great.

480
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,540
I can't see anything because of the red.

481
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:16,680
Oh.

482
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,820
Okay, go.

483
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,080
Get him in the butt.

484
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,040
Get him in the butt.

485
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,040
One more, maybe.

486
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,220
Gamer hay.

487
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,760
The fear!

488
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,180
I see it!

489
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,200
The fear!

490
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,100
The fear!

491
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,240
FAH!

492
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,050
Crazy!

493
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,550
I wonder if you'll be able to see those.

494
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,530
That'd be so fun.

495
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,370
The fear!

496
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,040
I see no bolts.

497
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,430
Spitter.

498
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:32,640
I got birdie oh get it birdie I got a book

499
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:59,020
my health could be better maybe we should grab some stuff while we're here like a bunny okay time to get lethal everybody time to get lethal my river will be full of bunnies hunting season.

500
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,030
Sorry, I've missed so many super chats, but thank you guys.

501
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,910
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you so much.

502
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,630
I really appreciate it.

503
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:11,610
We'll take that.

504
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,090
Oh, wait.

505
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,270
Nah, we're doing non-nuclear.

506
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,230
Tail is too small.

507
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,690
Snake needs a fatter tail.

508
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,610
Zero out of 10 unplayable.

509
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,530
Oh, my God.

510
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,610
You can't please anybody these days.

511
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,820
There we go.

512
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,520
Where'd that bunny go?

513
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,480
Oh, sweet rabbit.

514
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,350
There you are.

515
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,580
Lunch.

516
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,400
Where'd the gako go?

517
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,260
Those are.

518
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,280
This is the Yaboko Momoko.

519
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,380
This is a mystery.

520
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,930
Or it's our fruit.

521
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:17,850
Wait.

522
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,850
Actually, I'm not sure what I just got.

523
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,540
Sparkle?

524
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,160
I thought he was in this tree here.

525
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,580
I think I was mistaken.

526
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,800
Let's see what food we got.

527
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,040
Oh, yeah.

528
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,060
Not

529
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,600
so great.

530
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,560
Not so great.

531
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,120
We haven't eaten the rabbit yet.

532
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,120
Yeah, hold on, let's call a paramedic and see how it tastes.

533
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,000
I see you've captured a magpie.

534
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,540
Magpies are members of the crow family.

535
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,680
They're distinguishable by their beautiful dark blue and white bodies and their long tails.

536
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,920
Their favorite food is insects, but they'll also eat small fish, acorns, and fruit.

537
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,380
They're omnivores, which means...

538
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,280
They'll eat anything.

539
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,880
Right, just like you, huh?

540
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,620
Like a stuffy nose?

541
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,520
Okay, so how do they taste?

542
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,060
You always ask me that.

543
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:21,820
Naturally.

544
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:51,080
so I've never heard of anybody actually eating a magpie but I suppose there's no reason you couldn't you don't say I see you've caught a European rabbit yes the European rabbit is said to have come from the Mediterranean region originally but nowadays they're found all over the world they've been used since ancient times as a source of food so it might be worth catching them rabbits are known to eat their own excrement.

545
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,280
They eat their own...

546
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,900
That's right.

547
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,520
It's called sickle feces.

548
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:02,880
When the rabbit eats fibers, the fiber is fermented in the rabbit's appendix or secum and turned into a nutritious substance full of vitamins.

549
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,580
The rabbit excretes the substance and then eats it again to absorb the nutrients.

550
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,080
That's a neat trick.

551
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,640
I think I'll give it a try.

552
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,420
Snake, rabbits and humans don't work that...

553
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,540
I'm just kidding.

554
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,840
You really thought I was going to eat it?

555
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,580
A little, yeah.

556
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,820
You mean I wouldn't do that.

557
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,220
I guess not.

558
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,680
But how did those single feces taste?

559
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,260
What?

560
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,260
I'm just kidding.

561
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,200
He's such a trickster.

562
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:31,900
Snake.

563
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,880
Alright, let's eat some rabbit.

564
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,020
Actually, I don't think we need to eat all of it.

565
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,840
We'll just eat the mango.

566
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,960
We'll save that for when we're hungry.

567
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,820
Pretty tasty.

568
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,100
Pretty tasty.

569
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,480
He's such a goofy guy.

570
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,170
isn't he?

571
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,060
Where did the bird go?

572
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,040
Gakko, gakko, gakko.

573
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,150
Hold on, let's try from over here.

574
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,820
I lost him.

575
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,500
Maybe I have to climb up this tree.

576
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,920
Climb, climb.

577
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:16,940
Oh!

578
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,660
Big boy.

579
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,120
There he is.

580
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,340
Oh wait, he's already spinning.

581
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,360
I got this one.

582
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,160
Did I get Kero-Tan in here then?

583
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,080
Um.

584
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,300
Hmm.

585
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,650
What was shining right there?

586
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,970
Maybe I didn't get Kero-Tan.

587
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,450
Hello.

588
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,410
He's so cute.

589
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,250
I meant Stiffy.

590
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,050
Miffy.

591
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,130
Miffy the rabbit.

592
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,050
I love Miffy.

593
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,390
And boars.

594
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,390
Wait, I see!

595
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,230
Oh, Kero-Tan's also twirling.

596
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,850
Just kidding, I got this area.

597
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,660
Passed out to your Half-Life 2 stream yesterday.

598
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,900
Is it a bad thing?

599
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,960
Am I cooked falling asleep to Oshi playing games?

600
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,140
Why is that a bad thing?

601
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,180
I have streamers that I like that I fall asleep to their streams all the time.

602
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,820
I put them on for sleep.

603
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,680
I don't think that's a bad thing.

604
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,240
Is it?

605
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,160
Give me the mushroom!

606
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:57,740
Okay.

607
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,720
Hold on.

608
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,840
I'm trying to remember how to...

609
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,960
How to roll.

610
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,440
No.

611
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,740
I can't...

612
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,240
Oh, okay.

613
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,840
I found out.

614
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,860
And good thing I dodged that.

615
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,080
I almost...

616
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,200
I almost rolled right into a trap.

617
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,920
Is this where the Tsichinoko is?

618
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,760
One of the places?

619
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,460
No, I think about it.

620
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,540
Is this where one of them is?

621
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,620
Like, one of the...

622
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,380
I think there's...

623
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,380
Oops.

624
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:45,560
Dang it.

625
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,060
I gotta get all my stuff again.

626
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,360
Ah, I gotta get all my stuff again.

627
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,360
Ah!

628
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,960
I fell for a loser trap.

629
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,660
That was so lame!

630
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,660
I just noticed also I should equip the...

631
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,540
Not the chaff.

632
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,220
Look at this.

633
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:09,980
Okay.

634
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,200
I fell for it.

635
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,660
Quite literally.

636
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:23,680
We're gonna eat this bird instead of capture it because there's no point in not eating something.

637
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,000
No, get up, Snake.

638
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,740
There you go.

639
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,020
Get your book.

640
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,700
Don't fall into that.

641
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,020
Get the rabbit.

642
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:34,500
Oops.

643
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,920
Eat the rabbit.

644
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,120
I'll eat the rabbit.

645
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,200
Walk right into that one.

646
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,400
Hey, this works.

647
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,500
Oh, that was great.

648
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,100
There we go.

649
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,740
All right, we should.

650
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,100
Then what else was there?

651
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,580
There was something.

652
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,360
over here.

653
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,280
Sorry, guys.

654
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,360
I didn't mean to fall into it.

655
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:58,820
Where?

656
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,440
I can't remember the Tsuchinoko like, proper location.

657
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,520
Where the little guy is at.

658
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,640
I just know he's a really fat guy.

659
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:12,900
Oh!

660
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,620
I didn't even see that one.

661
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,360
How did I avoid it twice?

662
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,270
Wow.

663
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,250
Your Honor, she's a gamer.

664
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:35,730
I stepped right on the edge, but I didn't even see it before either.

665
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:37,330
Craziness.

666
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,530
Um, hold on, let me check the map again.

667
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:41,870
Okay, yeah.

668
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,910
What's the green checkmark?

669
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,550
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

670
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,380
I'm going to collect a little bit more food.

671
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,600
Like some...

672
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

673
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,300
Some mushrooms?

674
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,540
Mushroom sea?

675
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,520
Mushroom dew?

676
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
Maybe it's...

677
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,920
Ah, I can't remember at all where the...

678
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,320
There's another trap right there!

679
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,360
Grab some rabbit.

680
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,460
Wabbit hunting season.

681
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,120
Oh,

682
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:45,720
barely.

683
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,760
No, my food is full!

684
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,940
Okay, we're gonna have to get rid of something.

685
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:55,930
My Russian glow crab.

686
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:57,590
Congratulations.

687
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:57,890
Oh.

688
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:03,550
First winner of both Felford Award and almost Felford Award.

689
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:04,410
Oh,

690
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:08,490
my batteries.

691
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,150
There we go.

692
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:11,650
Okie dokie.

693
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:12,930
Or the Choki.

694
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,390
I really want to see a Tsuchinoko one day.

695
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:17,870
In the game.

696
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,090
Real life is kind of whatever.

697
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,290
But I want to see one in the game, you know?

698
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:28,570
I want to see that big fat guy just kind of crawling around.

699
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,210
I want to see that.

700
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,430
They're really...

701
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:36,930
They have like such tiny bodies and it's just really round.

702
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,450
Tsuchinoko real!

703
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,330
It's in the game.

704
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:43,990
It's here.

705
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:44,650
It's real.

706
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,890
They are cute, right?

707
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,030
The whole codec team finds over it.

708
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:50,810
I know!

709
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,050
I want to see!

710
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,450
And then, paramedics like, Don't you dare eat it!

711
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,230
I can't help it.

712
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,450
If I'm hungry, I mean...

713
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:03,910
Okay.

714
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,010
Onward!

715
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,620
Thank you.

716
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,590
Snake is always hungry.

717
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,190
Oh, I went the wrong way.

718
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,300
I got too interested in Lil Tsuchinoko.

719
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,320
I forgot completely.

720
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:42,870
I have a friend named Apache.

721
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,430
He's a MGS3.

722
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:45,890
He's a Metal Gear Speedrunner.

723
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,170
And he can do this game literally.

724
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:51,690
Actually, like, when I say he can play this game blindfolded, like I'm not exaggerating.

725
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,730
Like, he plays it blindfolded.

726
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,630
But this area scares me the most.

727
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:03,870
Like after you finish the fear, how do you know where you are to avoid all the traps, you know?

728
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,370
Yeah, he's really good.

729
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:13,730
I recommend his playthroughs.

730
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:15,170
He's played for like GTQ.

731
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,430
I remember where we're going.

732
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:23,090
Um, I will leave my camouflage for this room.

733
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,070
What if...

734
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,490
Wait, what does spider give me again?

735
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,350
Where stealth at the cost of stamina?

736
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:36,670
It's not...

737
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,110
Webby enough for me.

738
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:39,470
I don't know.

739
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,250
It's not webby enough.

740
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,190
But we got more stealth.

741
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,630
Drain- how- let's see how much stamina it does drain.

742
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,770
I guess we would need like food after food after food after food.

743
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,990
And my hat.

744
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,610
Sorry, crock hat.

745
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:00,470
Nah, it's fine.

746
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,660
Oh, I see it going down.

747
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,920
So fast.

748
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Do

749
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,360
you see that?

750
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,260
That's crazy.

751
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,440
Oh, my gosh.

752
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,720
Okay, never mind.

753
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,080
That's insane.

754
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,220
We'll go back to...

755
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,440
I like how nothing else compares We'll go back to the Peace Walker outfit

756
00:48:46,340 --> 00:49:32,720
Oh, it looks so good It looks so good There was one thing So actually it's with This outfit So this outfit is also In Ground zeros but in that the text here you see the text on the gold on his arm and on his thigh it's not there even though it's supposed like it's this is it originally was on the on the peace walker one but in ground zeros they didn't include it but in this game they do include it so this one is actually more accurate to Peace Walker.

757
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,440
It's not just like a port from the other game.

758
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,180
It's actually like...

759
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,040
What's it say?

760
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,360
I don't know.

761
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,200
My suppressor is on, right?

762
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,000
Oh, I'm already hungry.

763
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,080
Wait, my suppressor's on, right?

764
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,060
I love the music.

765
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:08,660
It's so good.

766
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,100
Tune, tune, tune, tune.

767
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,640
Oh, we saw him get hit.

768
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,780
Where is he?

769
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,040
Hello?

770
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,000
Are you gonna go investigate your friend?

771
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,040
Hello?

772
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,000
Are we gonna do anything?

773
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,720
Time to eat.

774
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,760
I'll eat.

775
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,160
of.

776
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,840
Oh, we didn't eat the bird.

777
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,140
Gross.

778
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,280
Okay, it's not good.

779
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,220
We'll eat the rabbit.

780
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,260
You never liked that guy?

781
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,880
I do know about blowing up the food supply.

782
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,420
I can't tell if some guy is coming up or not.

783
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,020
I can't tell what the AI is doing it all.

784
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,180
I don't know, actually.

785
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,340
Oh, there he goes.

786
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,380
Oh, my gosh.

787
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:32,840
What's wrong?

788
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,240
Hello?

789
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,180
Is nobody gonna investigate?

790
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:38,800
What's wrong?

791
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,700
I don't know.

792
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:42,530
Oh, there it is.

793
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:44,720
Oh, shoot.

794
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,220
Come on, sleep!

795
00:51:54,120 --> 00:52:07,060
be sleepy there we go i was kind of terrible but it's fine now where's our other guy hello

796
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:37,420
no one worry about the oh shoot you don't see me there we go I think that's, yeah.

797
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,100
Hang.

798
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,640
And drop.

799
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,020
Oh my gosh.

800
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:49,780
I can't remember.

801
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,540
Even though it tells me.

802
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:52,420
There we go.

803
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,300
Thank you.

804
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,540
Uh, I need to go through that door.

805
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,300
Third time's the charm.

806
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,700
Give me your stuff.

807
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,300
Wait.

808
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,320
I want a crab.

809
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,160
Be careful of that guy.

810
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,920
You're doing everywhere but the crab?

811
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,300
Oh, my bad.

812
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,050
Okay, don't worry about it.

813
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:38,130
We'll eat right.

814
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:39,750
We'll eat right.

815
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:41,930
Oh, I

816
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:50,670
didn't actually remember the crabs.

817
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,130
I think they're not very good, but whatever.

818
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,700
The rat.

819
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,640
The pekoro made famous.

820
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,540
Let's not have this out.

821
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,290
There we go.

822
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,400
Oh, no, I meant it to change.

823
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,980
Good thing the crab isn't one of the bosses.

824
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,000
Hear me, snake.

825
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:35,530
Wait, wait, hold on.

826
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:36,690
Let me call, actually.

827
00:54:38,070 --> 00:55:10,850
see what she says about it i see you've caught yourself a kenyan mangrove crab yeah the kenyan mangrove crab is a land-going crab it lives in burrows dug near seashores and mangrove swamps the spots a mushroom next to the tree here might hurt a little bit it attacks you with its pinchers thank you mcmack i'll look i'll grab it wait did she say it's poisonous i see you caught yourself a rat yep the rats in that area are the descendants of wild norway rats that were domesticated by humans as pets and lab animals.

828
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:11,650
Grab battle.

829
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:17,970
They're not poisonous, and I don't think they'll attack you, but they're quick little creatures, so you might have a hard time catching one.

830
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:18,750
I got it.

831
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:21,930
I got the red.

832
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:23,470
We're not so hungry.

833
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,210
Okay, wait, there's a...

834
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:26,790
I...

835
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:27,190
Eva.

836
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:30,250
Snake, are you there?

837
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:31,990
Eva, where are you?

838
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,530
Sorry, I was like, I'm spoiling it.

839
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,010
Dr. Sokolov is here too.

840
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:37,310
Is he all right?

841
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:38,470
He's fine.

842
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:41,730
Right now he's busy putting the finishing touches on the Shagohad.

843
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:42,630
Good.

844
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,610
That means they haven't killed him.

845
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,110
Not yet anyway, but you better hurry.

846
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:49,570
They've already finished the phase two tests.

847
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:54,510
Once the final preparations are complete, they'll have no more use for him.

848
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:59,510
The Colonel won't have any qualms about killing him if he thinks the CIA is closing in.

849
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,510
Eva, you can't let Sokolov out of your sight.

850
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:02,870
Oh, really?

851
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:03,390
I know.

852
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:03,750
I know.

853
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,650
Snake, do you know where Groznygrad is?

854
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:07,290
Groznygrad is.

855
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:11,950
Granin told me that I should be able to get there from the mountains to the north, through an underground tunnel.

856
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:13,390
Granin told you?

857
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:16,510
Yeah, he even gave me the key to the warehouse.

858
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:17,250
Why?

859
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:19,250
Because he was drunk, I guess.

860
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,370
You've got to be kidding me.

861
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:22,690
Hell if I know.

862
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:25,490
Snake, there's one problem with that route.

863
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:26,630
What problem?

864
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:30,930
The mountain entrance to the underground tunnel that leads to the fortress is sealed.

865
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:32,630
You need a key to get in.

866
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:33,630
A key?

867
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:36,050
What about the key Granin gave me?

868
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:37,290
That key won't work.

869
00:56:37,310 --> 00:57:08,050
but don't worry I'll figure something out okay I have an idea there are some ruins at the top of the mountains meet me there the top of the mountains got it wait there's something else I've got to tell you now what I heard that one of the cobras is waiting for you in the jungle at the foot of the mountains he's a legendary sniper called the end yeah I've seen him before grandpa that ridiculously old guy right don't underestimate him Hebeyo!

870
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,450
He's known as the father of modern sniping.

871
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:11,850
Is he alone?

872
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:13,150
No spotter?

873
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:13,890
None.

874
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:15,550
He's all by himself.

875
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,150
Apparently he doesn't need a spotter.

876
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,950
You can't be serious.

877
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,390
The entire forest is on his side.

878
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:23,550
The forest?

879
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:24,890
Stay alert.

880
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:25,790
Yeah.

881
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,710
I'd hate to have it be the end for me.

882
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:31,530
Good one, Snake.

883
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:35,550
Did I just see blue feathers?

884
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:40,800
Huh.

885
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,380
Hey, B-O.

886
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,500
Yeah, he's like right over there.

887
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:49,820
Let's see.

888
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,180
Got ourselves a book?

889
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,080
Who's reading out here, huh?

890
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,240
Oh, no.

891
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,780
Oh, these ones.

892
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,300
On mission today, so I'll have to catch up later.

893
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,300
No worries.

894
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,740
Thanks for dropping by.

895
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,580
Thanks, insanity.

896
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,700
Oh, oh, my food.

897
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:13,920
I forgot my food is full.

898
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:14,700
We can eat.

899
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,420
We can eat the mushrooms.

900
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,680
They're, like, so little.

901
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,520
Oh.

902
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,760
What is this?

903
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:23,820
I thought they were little.

904
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,940
Wait, before it, like, offered such little amount.

905
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,300
What is there?

906
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,020
Oh, it's the bird.

907
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,260
Oh, that's a...

908
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,580
I thought that was a tail.

909
00:58:43,780 --> 00:59:03,940
he is oh wait no he's not over there he's over okay hold on um did i get it do anyone any oh let's search for gako kero time don't bully the elderly um no promises i think

910
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:14,720
kero time is still surprisingly difficult because the land is actually It's actually quite green and lush.

923
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,420
Even Gako here.

924
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,340
Maybe he's just not around.

925
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:24,460
Oh, whoops.

926
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:27,380
Ay.

927
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,500
Ay.

928
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:40,950
I don't remember how to get to the regular screen.

929
01:00:41,410 --> 01:01:14,270

931
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:27,210
All right, a little bunny.

932
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:33,750
No, my food is faux.

933
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:38,910
Throw out some more Russian glow caps.

934
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:41,730
So sad.

935
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:42,810
I don't really use it anyway.

936
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:44,190
I don't really use the batteries.

937
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:49,210
But I want to keep the stuff that I can poison people with.

938
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,490
I guess I don't need this guy either.

939
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,410
Well, well, he doesn't take up anything.

940
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:59,230
And this guy, he's not dead, so they won't eat him.

941
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,450
Well, they get scared of him, I don't know.

942
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:03,110
Vivicore, thanks for the gift, dude!

943
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:09,390
No, there's like a headache medicine that's like a powder form and it's so bitter.

944
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,510
Why are you guys saying weird?

945
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:14,530
You guys are like, okay?

946
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:15,570
No!

947
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:19,050
What's wrong with you?

948
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:21,710
Oh, I did eat this crab before.

949
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,230
Said not to be very good.

950
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,730
Contains poison neutralizing properties.

951
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:31,570
Okay, we got the rabbit.

952
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:33,450
Rabbit, rabbit.

953
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:36,070
I don't want to...

954
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:37,590
Oh, this...

955
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:37,930
Oh, yeah.

956
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,050
Is it this guy?

957
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:42,490
Okay.

958
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:55,870

959
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:51,060

960
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:51,400
That's all.

961
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:52,680
That's all?

962
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,460
That's all the guide says.

963
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,240
Okay, so I don't know that much about it.

964
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,680
Why don't you eat one and see?

965
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,140
It might be pretty tasty.

966
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,440
Eat one and see?

967
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,620
What do I look like, a lab rat?

968
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:04,500
Shh!

969
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,820
What did I say?

970
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,040
What if the rats hear you?

971
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,580
You'll hurt their feelings.

972
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,840
Why is she so weird sometimes?

973
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,540
Why is she... Why are you...

974
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,620
Why are they so weird?

975
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:36,680
I feel like it's one of those kinds of things that, like, just gets translated a little bit funny.

976
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:39,640
I'm not quite sure.

977
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:43,660
Like with, like, an MGS2 nerd and node.

978
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,300
Like, it makes no sense in English.

979
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:47,940
Spa.

980
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,820
I don't see them.

981
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:51,680
I'm just gonna go.

982
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,580
I love how goofy this game is.

983
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:07,160
Oh my gosh, I've gotten so many TikToks about, like, I don't, actually, surprisingly, I don't get very metal, very many Metal Gear TikToks, even though I watch a lot of Metal Gear TikToks.

984
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:18,380
But lately, I've been getting a bunch of people playing this game for the first time, and they're like, it's every single one of the clips are about Ocelot and, like, his gun twirling and people reacting to it for the first time.

985
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,380
And I'm like, wow, I was literally there just like a couple years ago.

986
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,620
It's kind of crazy!

987
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,960
Master Ghost, happy birthday!

988
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,120
Eating it gives another codec.

989
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:31,380
Oh!

990
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:36,780
Well, I'll eat it when I have my health or my hunger a little bit more.

991
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:37,860
Thank you, though.

992
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,580
I will eat it.

993
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,620
Aren't there guys here?

994
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:42,340
Or am I crazy?

995
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,440
Aren't there guys before the end?

996
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:48,140
I don't remember.

997
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:01,900
I don't think I'm crazy.

998
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:03,460
I think there are.

999
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:27,580

1002
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:51,450
Three months sweet.

1003
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:51,990
Froggy!

1004
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:52,750
Thank you!

1005
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:56,370
Thank you, thank you.

1006
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:03,370
Oh my god, he's looking right at me.

1007
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:05,330
Wait, my camo is like so bad.

1008
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:16,620
That's not what I meant to do.

1009
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,260
My camo should be 100%, what are they talking about?

1010
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,480
What are they talking about?

1011
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,360
I have to go so far.

1012
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:32,370
Literally a crocodile.

1013
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:34,870
If you ignore the gun.

1014
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:39,190
See, now I'm 90.

1015
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:40,610
I don't understand.

1016
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:44,510
Wait, hold on.

1017
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:45,330
Let me look at the map again.

1018
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:47,430
Okay, we're just going forward.

1019
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:49,250
Okay.

1020
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:53,540
Onwards.

1021
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,640
Wait, this way?

1022
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:06,730
I'm getting lost.

1023
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:09,570
This way.

1024
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:12,630
I was like, this looks like the correct way.

1025
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:19,950
Move out of the way, birds.

1026
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,290
I'm crawling through here as a gator.

1027
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:24,730
I'm just gatoring it up.

1028
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:27,070
I don't care anymore.

1029
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:31,610
I'm a gator.

1030
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:34,230
I'm...

1031
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:35,690
Oh, shoot.

1032
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:37,490
Nothing?

1033
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:38,210
Just a crocodile?

1034
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:39,830
I'm not a gator.

1035
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:41,070
Don't call me that.

1036
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,430
Don't call me a gator.

1037
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:46,830
That's not my name.

1038
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:49,790
I'm a crock.

1039
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:51,130
I'm a crock.

1040
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,900
Do you think they can hear the rubber?

1041
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,480
Can you guys hear it?

1042
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:11,900
Can you guys?

1043
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,060
How's the volume, by the way?

1044
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,200
For some reason, the game seems really quiet today.

1045
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,360
I've turned it up like all the way.

1046
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,560
I hear more bees.

1047
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:27,700
Dirty!

1048
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,560
It's good?

1049
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:36,860
Thank you!

1050
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,200
Thank you!

1051
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:39,860
Where are we?

1052
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,500
I'm going the wrong way.

1053
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,640
I gotta go.

1054
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,120
What is over there?

1055
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:46,580
I don't remember.

1056
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:48,580
Oh wait!

1057
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,980
Is over there like that house?

1058
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,040
I think.

1059
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,360
It's like a little house.

1060
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:09,670
Hello?

1061
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:11,250
There we go.

1062
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:15,550
Let's reload.

1063
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,360
I can't remember.

1064
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,140
Yeah, I can't remember the button though.

1065
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:43,500
Ah!

1066
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:43,980
Ah!

1067
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,840
I love this cutscene.

1068
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:47,360
No!

1069
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,780
I love this scene though.

1070
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,140
Yo!

1071
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:13,220
Crocodiles weirdly kicked up.

1072
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,920
Hello?

1073
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:19,280
Hello?

1074
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:27,080
Do you hear me say...

1075
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,080
Woo!

1076
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,440
I beg of you.

1077
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,940
Grant me the strength to take this final prey.

1078
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:48,680
Let me linger in this world just a little longer.

1079
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:56,180
I have already slept enough for one lifetime.

1080
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,620
Enough for an eternity.

1081
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:26,340

I found that sniper you were talking about.

1084
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:18,770
So cool.

1085
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:19,510
That's the end.

1086
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:20,610
He's a legend.

1087
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:22,910
Known as the father of sniping.

1088
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:23,570
Do you hear me sniping?

1089
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:26,490
I've got experience sniping in urban and marine environments.

1090
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:27,670
What about the forest?

1091
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:28,710
Never.

1092
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:30,070
I see.

1093
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:33,490
Well, that forest is divided into three areas.

1094
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:34,990
I love, I love, I love the end.

1095
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:35,810
Oh my gosh.

1096
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:38,770
He should be lying in wait for you in one of those places.

1097
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:40,990
Sounds like this may take a while.

1098
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:42,830
It'll be a test of endurance.

1099
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:44,210
Be careful though.

1100
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:44,570
Okay.

1101
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:50,010
From what I've heard, the End has an almost supernatural knack for camouflaging himself.

1102
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:50,650
Such a good fight.

1103
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:51,170
I know!

1104
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:52,070
Okay.

1105
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:52,610
Okay.

1106
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:55,590
This guy's over a hundred years old, though.

1107
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:58,030
So I should have the advantage in terms of stamina.

1108
01:13:58,170 --> 01:13:58,910
People have tried that, right?

1109
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:00,430
Or I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.

1110
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:01,590
Why is that?

1111
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,490
I've heard that his body is photosynthetic.

1112
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:05,370
Like a plant?

1113
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:06,610
What is he?

1114
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:07,710
Some kind of monster?

1115
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,910
On top of that, he can speak to the forest too.

1116
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:13,610
So in other words, he knows it inside out.

1117
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:15,870
Wait, is actually still a thing?

1118
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:16,650
But he doesn't know you.

1119
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,670
I'm sure you can beat him.

1120
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:19,770
Don't worry.

1121
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:21,370
I intend to.

1122
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:23,250
Just wait it out real time.

1123
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:26,050
I'm a croc.

1124
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,060
Okay.

1125
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:33,020
Alright.

1126
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,420
The battle begins, everybody.

1127
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,560
The battle begins!

1128
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,980
Where's my mic?

1129
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,760
I do have it, right?

1130
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,560
Uh...

1131
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,820
Can you stop praying for my grandpa?

1132
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,680
He's when he goes...

1133
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,040
Wait, what?

1134
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:56,880
Half...

1135
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:57,900
Wait, what?

1136
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:02,280
He's waking up so he can unalive one half of my OTP BB...

1137
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,200
What the hell?

1138
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,160
What?

1139
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:17,930
I don't have a mic.

1140
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,410
Okay, cool.

1141
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:25,610
Um...

1142
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:25,970
Cool?

1143
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,770
Is it under weapons?

1144
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:30,810
Let me just see.

1145
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:32,950
That'd be so bad.

1146
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:39,360
Thank goodness.

1147
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,260
Oh my goodness.

1148
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:42,680
I was gonna say.

1149
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:43,960
This sucks.

1150
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,320
We'll never find him ever.

1151
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:54,800
I hear the squeaking of mine.

1152
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,560
I don't think he's in this area.

1153
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,120
My camo is being 10%.

1154
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:16,580
Literally an alligator.

1155
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:18,520
I mean a crocodile.

1156
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,400
What's wrong with me?

1157
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:20,280
Why do I keep saying...

1158
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:23,940
It's so much easier to say alligator than crocodile to me for some reason.

1159
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:34,600
Yep.

1160
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:35,600
Oh my gosh.

1161
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:50,500
I can't tell at all how to see him.

1162
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:51,520
Uh-oh.

1163
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,960
I was worried about this fight.

1164
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:56,940
I'm not gonna lie.

1165
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,180
Why?

1166
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,800
Is this...

1167
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:03,540
I don't see like...

1168
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:04,740
his scope, you know?

1169
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:19,050
I wonder how it...

1170
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:20,450
Well, you can try the thermals.

1171
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:22,870
I don't know if it'll be too ugly.

1172
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:23,430
We'll see.

1173
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:26,170
Oh, I did have a clip.

1174
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:26,850
I'm stupid.

1175
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:31,490
Oh!

1176
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:32,990
Ugh!

1177
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:37,230
I didn't see the ref...

1178
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:38,790
I saw...

1179
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:43,830
Like, it was, like, definitely shining something.

1180
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:48,970
There was like some light, but it was not like the little flash of light that I'm used to.

1181
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:58,430
So I honestly don't know how to see him.

1182
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:06,800
The thermal showed?

1183
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,750
I don't know if that's him or not.

1184
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:16,010
That just looks like plants to me.

1185
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:23,230
Put the mic back on, see if he's...

1186
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:24,510
He might have left this area.

1187
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:34,600
Where the hell was he?

1188
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:37,580
His stamina?

1189
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:37,980
Oh, wait.

1190
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:38,660
That's my stamina.

1191
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,180
I'm stupid.

1192
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,880
But his stamina is also getting lower.

1193
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:42,940
I was like, his stamina is so low.

1194
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,420
That's me.

1195
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:54,660
I'm like, stand tall.

1196
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:18,900
I hear something.

1197
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,180
How does this happen?

1198
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,220
No, it's not reload.

1199
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:51,480
Wait.

1200
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:54,880
Why isn't it reloading?

1201
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:56,440
Oh, wait.

1202
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,120
I only have four bullets left?

1203
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,440
Oh, I'm so screwed.

1204
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:00,520
Wait.

1205
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:01,440
Uh-oh.

1206
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:05,700
Wait, you guys, if I only have four bullets, I think I'm in trouble.

1207
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:08,700
I only have four bullets left.

1208
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,400
I should have raided the warehouse.

1209
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:12,200
Oh, I see.

1210
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,300
Got go up there.

1211
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,180
Oh, no.

1212
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:19,040
Oh, CQC time with the old man!

1213
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:31,920
Was it you?

1214
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,450
Oh, jeez.

1215
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:38,870
I do have the smoke, yeah.

1216
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:41,250
The sig spray.

1217
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:46,290
No, we heard Kero-tan.

1218
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:47,810
Oh, bako bako.

1219
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,000
Wait, maybe there's some more in here.

1220
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:08,910
TNT?

1221
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:10,450
Please.

1222
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:11,230
Ah!

1223
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,130
Okay, okay, okay, good, good, good.

1224
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:15,910
Okay, we got a little bit more.

1225
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:21,870
Just a tiny bit.

1226
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:24,270
We're so back.

1227
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,960
Okay, if he were here, I feel like...

1228
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:32,440
Well, okay.

1229
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:37,620
Actually, let's put on the camel...

1230
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:38,740
Which one is it?

1231
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,160
Sounds of footsteps.

1232
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:43,580
This one, too?

1233
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:44,620
No.

1234
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:45,180
No.

1235
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:48,640
Or naked woodland.

1236
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:51,780
Gold?

1237
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,300
Yeah, let's put on gold.

1238
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,760
It's so terrible.

1239
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:01,260
It's just so bad.

1240
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,420
I can't get over it.

1241
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,640
Like, his lips look so chapped in it.

1242
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,300
I don't know what it is.

1243
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:12,200
You love it?

1244
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:16,840
Okay.

1245
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:17,500
Um,

1246
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:38,660
here's something.

1247
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:41,700
Okay.

1248
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:44,100
I'm Mito.

1249
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:44,520
Hello!

1250
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,160
Holy...

1251
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,400
Oh, my god, it's...

1252
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:49,860
Butt!

1253
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,300
So sorry.

1254
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,000
Sorry, I keep going back into the menu.

1255
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,520
Uh, we'll eat this guy.

1256
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,200
Pretty tasty.

1257
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:15,020
Ahaya!

1258
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,160
Okay.

1259
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:21,160
Let's go this way.

1260
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:24,180
It's raining.

1261
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,020
This is good.

1262
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,100
This is good.

1263
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,860
He can't heal, but we're not doing anything either.

1264
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:33,320
Throw away your expired stuff.

1265
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,320
No, no, no.

1266
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,820
We can throw it at people.

1267
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,220
And they'll eat it and get sick.

1268
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,260
Oh, gosh!

1269
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,540
We're just getting started.

1270
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,980
You're making this too easy.

1271
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:52,660
I hear him here.

1272
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:55,760
Oh, I hear him running.

1273
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:00,900
Oh my gosh.

1274
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:07,070
Red snake!

1275
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:07,990
Go faster!

1276
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:10,990
Where'd he go?

1277
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:13,890
How was he so fast?

1278
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:15,270
Here?

1279
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:18,290
Oh my

1280
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:23,440
gosh, I see him.

1281
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:28,610
Wait, uh, ah!

1282
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:32,370
Oh my god, oh man!

1283
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:37,870
I hear a goat.

1284
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:39,370
Oh my god!

1285
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:42,250
This is so bad.

1286
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:47,610
You son of a...

1287
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:48,390
There he is.

1288
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:52,450
What am I...

1289
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:53,270
Oh, I have a...

1290
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:58,890
I have a couple tranquilizers in my head.

1291
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:07,800
We're about to fall asleep.

1292
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,160
Where'd he go?

1293
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:14,220
Yeah, I know.

1294
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,580
Oh, I lost him.

1295
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,020
I lost him!

1296
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:22,680
Ah!

1297
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,700
Oh, gosh.

1298
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:32,460
Hey, this works.

1299
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,940
Yeah, we might need to put on the thermals for following him.

1300
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:35,940
Actually...

1301
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:40,480
So sorry for your eyes.

1302
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:51,850
Is that him right there?

1303
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:54,250
Yes.

1304
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:55,850
Yes it is.

1305
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,480
I have to walk up on him and freeze him.

1306
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:07,620
Okay.

1307
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:09,420
Yeah, I gotta hold him up.

1308
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:16,870
He's like right in front of me, isn't he?

1309
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:22,090
I'm always so nervous about doing this though because I suck at holding people up.

1310
01:26:22,330 --> 01:26:22,610
It's okay.

1311
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:24,230
You'll find him in the end.

1312
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:37,920
He breathed?

1313
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:39,380
Where did you?

1314
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,220
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1315
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:55,200
Oh.

1316
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:04,260
Where'd he go?

1317
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:05,760
Where'd he go?

1318
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,160
He's so freaking fast.

1319
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,620
I think he's hiding up on this hill now.

1320
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:15,840
Yes.

1321
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:19,680
There he is.

1322
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:20,720
Nope, that's a goat.

1323
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,020
No, that's a goat.

1324
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:25,020
I thought it was him.

1325
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:26,360
It's a goat.

1326
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:41,700
He might still be in this area, though.

1327
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:43,980
Let's, uh, wait.

1328
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:48,940
I saw something down there, Moo.

1329
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,300
Oh, a bunny?

1330
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,020
Dang it.

1331
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:52,880
Oh my gosh.

1332
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:18,110
Kero-Tanjis!

1333
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:23,890
Stop!

1334
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,640
Uh-oh.

1335
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,900
It's beginning sunny again.

1336
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:45,860
Sorry.

1337
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,160
Oh gosh, it was so violent.

1338
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:51,700
Oh, it's foggy.

1339
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,600
I don't think he's here, you guys.

1340
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:56,580
I think he left, maybe.

1341
01:28:57,740 --> 01:29:01,780
Oh, that's not what I wanted to do.

1342
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:05,340
Uh...

1343
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:08,000
I'm out, like, straight in the open if he is here.

1344
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:08,180
Oh.

1345
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:10,820
Wake up.

1346
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:17,210
I don't think he's here.

1347
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:18,590
Ah!

1348
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:19,430
Go!

1349
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:19,850
Ah!

1350
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:20,610
There we go.

1351
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:22,950
Okay.

1352
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:26,330
Get out, get out.

1353
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,120
...

1354
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:39,910
Boom!

1355
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:47,500
Oh, it's like full sunny!

1356
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:58,080
Oh, finally out of the womb.

1357
01:29:59,120 --> 01:29:59,840
Congratulations!

1358
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:02,220
Thank you so much, though.

1359
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:03,280
Hope, Xenoblade.

1360
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:05,600
Thank you.

1361
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:07,940
Oh, we're back here again.

1362
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,540
Be very, very quiet.

1363
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:00,420
No!

1364
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,800
It's so funny.

1365
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:22,480
Maybe I should go this way.

1366
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:29,660
Should you eat this parrot right in front of him?

1367
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:30,360
No!

1368
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,900
There's only a few here.

1369
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:55,300
Also, how do you do this fight?

1370
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:57,720
Blindfolded.

1371
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,260
It's absolutely insane.

1372
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:02,910
Oh, he found him.

1373
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:03,370
He's here.

1374
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:12,810
I heard him.

1375
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:18,740
But where are you?

1376
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,440
I heard him, though.

1377
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,280
He's like over there, this way?

1378
01:32:58,850 --> 01:32:59,410
Oh.

1379
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:01,190
I'm gonna go to Crazy Camel.

1380
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:05,890
Let's do...

1381
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:06,990
Plus 20!

1382
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:07,770
That's insane!

1383
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:09,430
Wait.

1384
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:11,390
Maybe the face too.

1385
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:13,670
Thermals?

1386
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:14,330
Oh, thermals!

1387
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:15,310
Yes, thank you.

1388
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:16,830
Ah!

1389
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:18,030
Is that him?

1390
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:23,250
You can see it!

1391
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:24,250
You see a sniper!

1392
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:25,250
Oh, it does!

1393
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:25,810
It does!

1394
01:33:25,890 --> 01:33:26,730
It does glint!

1395
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:27,830
Ah!

1396
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:29,070
You can see it!

1397
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:29,410
You can see it!

1398
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:30,170
I see it!

1399
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:32,830
Ah-ha-ha!

1400
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:36,110
It's very, very slight.

1401
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:38,390
Compared to the original?

1402
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:39,050
Wow!

1403
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:41,430
That's like...

1404
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:42,510
That's crazy.

1405
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:45,570
Crazy subtle.

1406
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:47,430
I think...

1407
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:48,970
Okay, hold on.

1408
01:33:56,150 --> 01:33:57,690
How do we get over there?

1409
01:33:59,730 --> 01:34:02,730
Oh, and it also gives you the clue with this.

1410
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:03,890
With the reflection.

1411
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:08,570
So if you don't see, you can see it barely shining just a tiny bit.

1412
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:10,890
Wow, wow, wow.

1413
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:15,370
Just, just barely, just just barely.

1414
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:22,270
I like this other visual clue.

1415
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:24,470
A lot, actually.

1416
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:26,070
I think that's pretty nice.

1417
01:34:29,290 --> 01:34:30,130
Tree bark?

1418
01:34:30,570 --> 01:34:31,590
I'm desperate.

1419
01:34:35,150 --> 01:34:36,730
I want to get up on him, you know.

1420
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:39,230
But he's pretty...

1421
01:34:39,230 --> 01:34:41,210
I don't know even if I can get over there.

1422
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:42,190
Can I?

1423
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:46,610
Maybe, though, we can at least...

1424
01:34:46,610 --> 01:34:48,990
Well, I have to hold him up three times.

1425
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:00,660
Wait, where'd he go?

1426
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:06,450
I think I went too far over.

1427
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:11,110
Maybe, uh...

1428
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:29,840
I don't know everything.

1429
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:32,460
There's a lot of things I don't know.

1430
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:34,840
And things I forget also.

1431
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,140
Can I go to another area?

1432
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:45,890
I got back from a party and was busy unlocking all the achievements for Delta.

1433
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:47,610
Oh my gosh.

1434
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:57,060
I think that dot is him.

1435
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,540
There's no way I can shoot him from here.

1436
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:08,850
You can camp up there.

1437
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:09,470
You can go there.

1438
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:19,150
go there on this map unless I can go down can I go down like

1439
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:33,020
there's I don't think I can cross this I know Ryan need a trank sniper let

1440
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:43,740
me try going this way we're all dirty and gross

1441
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:51,540
yeah he's sleeping wow he's the loudest snorer ever

1442
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:09,640
maybe that exit yes yes so we have to go where are we?

1443
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,120
we have to go up to the left

1444
01:37:27,940 --> 01:38:02,880
hopefully he'll still be there and still be asleep sleepy sleepy old man okay but before we go in there I will change back to oh my goodness it's like a battle it's such a battle in here you know okay get rid of our footsteps i wish i did an audible like footstep thing too because i can't tell sometimes if my foot you know okay hey this works hey this works all right

1445
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:14,890
but having this with erasing my footsteps is like Makes it super nice for this fight, I'd say.

1446
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:29,090
Oh, a bad.

1447
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:54,420
What is that noise?

1448
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:56,320
I don't hear him, though.

1449
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:01,420
Please, please still be here.

1450
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:08,800
Please, please still be here.

1451
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:12,880
Sorry.

1452
01:39:19,110 --> 01:39:20,190
Cake jumpstick.

1453
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:34,420
Wait, I thought I was down there.

1454
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,380
Wait, I'm up here.

1455
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:41,960
Wait, I thought I would be down there.

1456
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:45,960
I'm up here.

1457
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:58,580
Then he would be...

1458
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:00,580
He would

1459
01:40:07,810 --> 01:40:09,090
be...

1460
01:40:11,990 --> 01:40:16,730
Oh my god, please!

1461
01:40:16,770 --> 01:40:18,490
We're just getting started.

1462
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:22,530
You can't get me through the tree?

1463
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:24,290
Oh my gosh.

1464
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:26,490
Wait, this POV is evil.

1465
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:46,930
The POV is awesome.

1466
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:48,050
It's great, right?

1467
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,580
Something slimy is in there.

1468
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:22,400
Did he leave?

1469
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:29,100
don't see the reflection anymore, like the little, I think he laughed.

1470
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:31,020
Wait, nope, he's still there.

1471
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:34,960
Oh, yeah, he's definitely still there.

1472
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:39,200
He's 100% still there.

1473
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:46,670
Oh, yeah.

1474
01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:48,810
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1475
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:51,510
Oh, yeah, he's still there.

1476
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:52,570
Can I get up there?

1477
01:41:55,010 --> 01:41:56,030
Oh, look at that.

1478
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:56,790
That's so cool.

1479
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:00,030
I don't think I can't.

1480
01:42:00,110 --> 01:42:00,570
Wait, maybe I can.

1481
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:02,210
Maybe I can.

1482
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:03,510
I think I can.

1483
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:05,770
Yeah, you see him?

1484
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:06,410
You see him?

1485
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:09,790
Sparkling it up there?

1486
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:41,600
Okay.

1487
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:45,120
We gotta find a way up there.

1488
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:51,780
If I keep close to the wall...

1489
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:52,040
No!

1490
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:52,580
Ah!

1491
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:53,700
Oh geez!

1492
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:54,680
Oh geez!

1493
01:42:59,060 --> 01:42:59,600
Awww!

1494
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,000
Eww!

1495
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:13,860
Eww!

1496
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:14,240
Eww!

1497
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:14,440
Eww!

1498
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:14,480
Eww!

1499
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:14,520
Eww!

1500
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:23,810
Let him shoot again.

1501
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:30,420
I at least got him.

1502
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:35,350
Dang it!

1503
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:36,870
That really threw off my whole plan!

1504
01:43:36,990 --> 01:43:41,290
I wasn't at all where I thought I would be.

1505
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:41,910
Oh!

1506
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:43,710
Ah!

1507
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:47,090
Wait till he goes to sleep.

1508
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:47,890
Pretty tasty.

1509
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:52,790
Yeah, I think he, you know, now knows where I am, so will he fall asleep?

1510
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:03,000
Wait, this is maybe good though.

1511
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,460
We're kind of covering this area.

1512
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:11,450
Actually, where am I?

1513
01:44:12,570 --> 01:44:15,130
Oh, how do I get up there?

1514
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:21,420
How the heckie?

1515
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:26,880
I'm just trying to figure out the map now.

1516
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:28,160
It feels so different.

1517
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:36,220
Like, I recognize it when I recognize it, but it also feels weird.

1518
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:37,820
Kerothan on my left?

1519
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:40,420
Where?

1520
01:44:47,670 --> 01:44:48,790
Right there.

1521
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:01,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1522
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:07,420
Where am I headed to?

1523
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:18,460
You're up soon.

1524
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:23,980
Those thermals aren't that bright except around Snake, so I think you've got to be staring at his cake to give play.

1525
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:25,040
Ashbang.

1526
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:27,060
No!

1527
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,140
Why would I be doing that?

1528
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:32,560
Why would I do that?

1529
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:33,520
Weirdo.

1530
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:34,440
Okay.

1531
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:01,180
Oh, my bad.

1532
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:14,740
Maybe he's not here.

1533
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:26,040
I did get everything in here that I could, right?

1534
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:30,720
Oh, oh, oh, they got more ammo.

1535
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:32,040
Okay, it does replenish.

1536
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:33,080
I was hoping.

1537
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,300
I was hoping they'd say that.

1538
01:46:47,450 --> 01:46:49,730
Snake, you've been caught in a snare trap?

1539
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:52,470
You're going to get yourself shot if you stay up there.

1540
01:46:52,570 --> 01:46:53,010
My bad.

1541
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:56,090
Use the action button to cut the rope and escape from the trap.

1542
01:46:56,770 --> 01:46:57,710
Hurry before he finds you.

1543
01:46:57,770 --> 01:46:58,510
I don't think he's here.

1544
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:00,890
I think he's here!

1545
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,440
Why does this keep happening to me?

1546
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:44,120
Is he running?

1547
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:59,580
Oh my gosh, that's not what I meant to do at all.

1548
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:13,270
I think he ran off the map.

1549
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:16,390
I think he ran that direction.

1550
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:22,190
I don't think he's here, JoJo's, if you could just...

1551
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:31,900
Oh, hi.

1552
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:33,640
Wanna grab you?

1553
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:38,620
Why aren't the bunnies afraid of people?

1554
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:52,000
Yeah, I think you went this way.

1555
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:58,700
Oh, geez.

1556
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:01,000
Why, geez.

1557
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:12,540
Someone once told me I sound like Rick and Morty when I say...

1558
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:17,620
Jeez, so I try to not say it, but I end up saying it.

1559
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:29,420
I don't want to be that.

1560
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:47,180
I don't know where to point in this map.

1561
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:48,000
You know?

1562
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:53,140
I think I know where Gakko is.

1563
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:07,860
Has anyone seen my rabbit little...

1564
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:09,260
This sort of fluffykins?

1565
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:10,880
He was hopping around there somewhere.

1566
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:13,060
What did he say?

1567
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,420
I think I heard him.

1568
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:24,120
I think I hear him.

1569
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:29,020
Wait, his bird!

1570
01:50:38,610 --> 01:50:39,750
Wait, where is he?

1571
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:44,250
I got his bird.

1572
01:50:44,910 --> 01:50:45,550
I got your bird.

1573
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:47,950
Ah, there, there!

1574
01:50:48,970 --> 01:50:50,970
Ready for some more.

1575
01:50:52,470 --> 01:50:53,590
Oh my gosh.

1576
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:54,190
Ah!

1577
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:57,230
I didn't think he would see me.

1578
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:00,190
Of course, why would I think that though?

1579
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:01,830
Of course he'll see me.

1580
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:04,130
Damn it, he recovered so much!

1581
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:08,370
Oh gosh, this is tricky.

1582
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:10,870
Holding him up is really hard guys.

1583
01:51:10,950 --> 01:51:11,970
I might just go for him though.

1584
01:51:12,530 --> 01:51:14,330
I might just like...

1585
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:14,790
Shoot.

1586
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:19,570
I might just try to get him.

1587
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:23,710
Eat the bird.

1588
01:51:25,230 --> 01:51:26,670
Why would you say that?

1589
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:27,970
And then my tummy growls.

1590
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:32,730
You okay, Snake?

1591
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:39,400
I did hold him up once.

1592
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,440
No, it's several times in the original.

1593
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:46,400
Oh, good, good.

1594
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:47,620
It's starting to rain again.

1595
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:53,500
Ah, I hate that he recovered so much.

1596
01:52:00,810 --> 01:52:01,530
Oh, shoot.

1597
01:52:03,470 --> 01:52:05,270
I didn't know he threw that.

1598
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:10,920
Oh, my God.

1599
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:11,900
I am.

1600
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:17,120
I

1601
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:36,470
think he could see me.

1602
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,000
Pretty tasty.

1603
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:47,220
Don't growl.

1604
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:47,960
Don't growl.

1605
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:53,880
I hope he doesn't hear that.

1606
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:55,040
That's so embarrassing.

1607
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:21,550
Freeze?

1608
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:22,610
Freeze?

1609
01:53:37,130 --> 01:53:38,410
Where did he go?

1610
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:39,810
Oh, there he is.

1611
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,920
How is he so much faster than me is what I wonder?

1612
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:53,360
Okay, I really lost him.

1613
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,460
How did I lose him?

1614
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:57,060
Oh, wait, his foot jumps.

1615
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:00,280
This way.

1616
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:06,870
Take his camo.

1617
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:08,050
Wait, did I miss it?

1618
01:54:08,230 --> 01:54:09,610
Did he drop it?

1619
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:19,920
Uh, wait, where was it?

1620
01:54:25,930 --> 01:54:26,910
Oh, hi, Kero-Kan.

1621
01:54:27,370 --> 01:54:28,310
No, I don't think he did.

1622
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:29,270
I didn't see it.

1623
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:31,430
Hold him up for longer.

1624
01:54:32,010 --> 01:54:32,890
Okay, okay, okay.

1625
01:54:33,310 --> 01:54:34,290
Wait, where did he go?

1626
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:35,030
Oh, shoot.

1627
01:54:37,830 --> 01:54:38,470
Is it this way?

1628
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:45,030
I completely lost the...

1629
01:54:45,030 --> 01:54:47,350
Oh, oh, you guys.

1630
01:54:48,410 --> 01:54:49,230
You guys!

1631
01:54:49,950 --> 01:54:51,290
Now I'm lost!

1632
01:54:52,530 --> 01:54:54,650
Um, I lost where he went.

1633
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:01,950
I think it was...

1634
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:04,920
No.

1635
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:07,020
Not yet.

1636
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:12,460
Uh, well that's...

1637
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:13,680
My fault, I guess.

1638
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:17,140
I guess it's my fault for getting lost.

1639
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:19,980
Yeah, he left the map.

1640
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:24,300
I just... I saw where he went and I don't remember how to get there.

1641
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:31,520
Was it this way?

1642
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:32,280
Who knows?

1643
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,260
I got one guy.

1644
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:09,200
It's okay though.

1645
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:13,940
I heard him.

1646
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:16,860
And I also heard...

1647
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:21,240
Is that him walking?

1648
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:23,360
That's a goat.

1649
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:27,340
I heard him though.

1650
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:28,140
I heard him whisper.

1651
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:34,940
Is he right in front of me?

1652
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:36,240
No.

1653
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:40,780
I didn't see, like, a text, so he's not that close.

1654
01:56:49,570 --> 01:56:50,750
Oh, he's asleep.

1655
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:02,740
Oh, but where?

1656
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:12,350
But where?

1657
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:12,850
But where?

1658
01:57:16,830 --> 01:57:17,430
Oh,

1659
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:21,460
I see him!

1660
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:22,000
I see him!

1661
01:57:40,030 --> 01:57:45,110
Okay, I'll hold him up for longer this time.

1662
01:58:02,890 --> 01:58:06,010
Oh, there we go.

1663
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:06,730
Come

1664
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:23,860

1665
01:58:30,690 --> 01:58:30,990
Yippee!

1666
01:58:39,940 --> 01:58:40,780
Where'd he go?

1667
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:43,160
I lost him again.

1668
01:58:43,740 --> 01:58:44,620
Why do I keep losing?

1669
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:52,820
him i don't even see his footsteps wait no that's too much

1670
01:58:57,160 --> 01:59:07,000
ammo okay wow we where it gives photosynthetic capabilities extremely effective in areas

1671
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:25,750
maybe we can get 100 yeah i also got to find this guy again I got it!

1672
01:59:26,390 --> 01:59:27,850
A good man is hard to find.

1673
01:59:28,350 --> 01:59:30,550
Achieve a camo index of 100%.

1674
01:59:31,950 --> 01:59:32,610
Yippee!

1675
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:37,330
Nice.

1676
01:59:38,970 --> 01:59:40,150
I lost him, though.

1677
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:42,130
I completely lost him.

1678
01:59:43,470 --> 01:59:43,670
Oh, wait.

1679
01:59:43,710 --> 01:59:44,070
What's this?

1680
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,600
I think he went behind me.

1681
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:56,800
But maybe his footsteps got...

1682
01:59:58,740 --> 01:59:59,300
Oh.

1683
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:01,620
Unless...

1684
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:02,700
Wait, that's...

1685
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:03,700
That's him?

1686
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:04,740
Just kidding?

1687
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:08,240
I found him?

1688
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:23,770
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1689
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:24,290
It's 100%.

1690
02:00:40,870 --> 02:00:43,610
Again, again!

1691
02:00:45,590 --> 02:00:46,550
Again, again!

1692
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:05,180
I'm following, I'm following.

1693
02:01:09,170 --> 02:01:09,930
Or is that a goat?

1694
02:01:12,210 --> 02:01:12,970
Oh, that's him.

1695
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:16,310
Oh, he couldn't hear me because it doesn't know where my footsteps are!

1696
02:01:22,390 --> 02:01:24,370
I thought it was another goat.

1697
02:01:26,810 --> 02:01:28,430
What if I just get him from here?

1698
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:37,900
I'm following, I'm following, I'm following, I'm following, I'm following.

1699
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:43,180
Wait, this fight is so great with the battle suit.

1700
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,860
It's so nice, actually.

1701
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:47,380
There he goes.

1702
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:48,800
Bye, Grandpa.

1703
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:51,600
God, he's so fast.

1704
02:01:53,020 --> 02:01:55,180
The fastest in all the land.

1705
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:00,100
Oh my gosh.

1706
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:01,960
Ah!

1707
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:12,190
Wait!

1708
02:02:12,510 --> 02:02:12,750
Wait!

1709
02:02:14,830 --> 02:02:15,630
Ah!

1710
02:02:15,630 --> 02:02:16,350
Oh, there he is.

1711
02:02:28,630 --> 02:02:29,430
Yes!

1712
02:02:38,770 --> 02:02:40,370
This is!

1713
02:02:41,230 --> 02:02:42,350
This is the end!

1714
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:51,410
How is it so easy?

1715
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:57,870
Because I'm wearing a camo that makes it so that they can't hear your footsteps, so...

1716
02:02:58,790 --> 02:03:01,570
I kind of... That's like the real cheese, to be honest.

1717
02:03:06,910 --> 02:03:09,390
Spirits of the forest...

1718
02:03:10,090 --> 02:03:11,190
I thank you.

1719
02:03:11,730 --> 02:03:13,390
The boss...

1720
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:16,350
Would be proud of you.

1721
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:21,530
The time has come for a younger generation to rise.

1722
02:03:22,390 --> 02:03:23,310
No camo.

1723
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:24,350
I got the camo.

1724
02:03:24,550 --> 02:03:25,450
What are you talking about?

1725
02:03:26,190 --> 02:03:26,930
You missed it.

1726
02:03:26,950 --> 02:03:34,710
I've been wandering for more than a century and now my journey Comes to a close.

1727
02:03:34,770 --> 02:03:39,970
Wait, I got that bird What a splendid way to end it all.

1728
02:03:39,970 --> 02:03:54,630
That's my bird That's my lodge I have no regrets I can return to the forest For him, I'll die.

1729
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:14,120
Nice.

1730
02:04:40,290 --> 02:04:41,870
Okie dokie, now where was that?

1731
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:46,570
Woohoo!

1732
02:04:47,410 --> 02:04:48,270
Wait, where?

1733
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:50,170
There it is.

1734
02:04:51,330 --> 02:04:54,450
Gimme, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.

1735
02:04:58,650 --> 02:04:59,250
Nice!

1736
02:04:59,730 --> 02:05:00,250
Oh, wait.

1737
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:05,000
Nice, nice, nice.

1738
02:05:07,580 --> 02:05:07,640
Oh.

1739
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:08,420
Beep, beep.

1740
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:16,060
Oh, I guess we don't need this anymore.

1741
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:18,380
I'll put this back.

1742
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:19,560
Okay.

1743
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:20,420
Woo!

1744
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:33,160
I should have gotten some good pictures with him in the end.

1745
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:38,820
Let's go back to being a crocodile suit.

1746
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:52,980
Nice.

1747
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:54,720
Now where was it?

1748
02:05:57,400 --> 02:05:59,000
This away.

1749
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:01,240
This.

1750
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:05,180
This away.

1751
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:07,580
This away.

1752
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:15,240
Okay, before that, though, I kind of want...

1753
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:16,900
I'm hungry for some goat.

1754
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:19,440
Anyone else hungry?

1755
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:26,420
Ninto the best though, no.

1756
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:28,680
No.

1757
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:38,940
Paramedic, I caught a parrot.

1758
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:40,340
What kind of parrot?

1759
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:40,620
Yeah.

1760
02:06:40,860 --> 02:06:43,180
It's green all over with a large beak.

1761
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:45,960
Then it's probably an Alexandrine parakeet.

1762
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:49,100
It's sometimes also called the Alexandrine parrot.

1763
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:49,740
Parrot.

1764
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:55,440
The Alexandrine parakeet originally comes from Indochina and is distinguished by its green body and red beak.

1765
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:55,800
Yeah.

1766
02:06:55,900 --> 02:06:57,980
It's very talkative and makes a good pet.

1767
02:06:59,020 --> 02:06:59,820
But it's strange.

1768
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:04,360
The guide doesn't say anything about there being Alexandrine parakeets in that area.

1769
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:07,560
I'm thinking it must be someone's pet that got away.

1770
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:10,080
Snake.

1771
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:10,960
What?

1772
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:15,000
Don't even think about it, eating a cute little bird like that.

1773
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:16,240
But I didn't say.

1774
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:17,400
Just don't.

1775
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:25,880
I see you caught a mark or...

1776
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:26,240
I did.

1777
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:29,580
The Marcore is a kind of wild goat that lives in mountainous areas.

1778
02:07:30,180 --> 02:07:34,780
It's quite large, so I don't think you'll be able to capture one alive, even with the tranquilizer gun.

1779
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:35,680
All right.

1780
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:36,420
The Spasa.

1781
02:07:36,860 --> 02:07:39,980
Speaking of which, do you know the origin of the name Marcore?

1782
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:40,840
No.

1783
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:44,140
It means snake eater in Persian.

1784
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:45,800
Snake eater?

1785
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:47,540
Lost your appetite?

1786
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:48,900
Not at all.

1787
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:51,060
So, how does it taste?

1788
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:53,000
It's supposed to be pretty good.

1789
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:54,220
All right.

1790
02:07:55,900 --> 02:07:57,100
All right.

1791
02:07:57,980 --> 02:08:00,880
Now let's eat this guy.

1792
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:06,300
This is really good.

1793
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:07,740
Oh.

1794
02:08:16,020 --> 02:08:16,200
Wait.

1795
02:08:20,630 --> 02:08:30,450
Look at his sleeping face.

1796
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:31,350
Look at his sleeping face.

1797
02:08:31,610 --> 02:08:33,610
Look at his sleeping face!

1798
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:35,610
Look at his little face!

1799
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:38,950
No!

1800
02:08:40,610 --> 02:08:42,250
How can I get down, please?

1801
02:08:43,190 --> 02:08:43,710
No, please.

1802
02:08:45,890 --> 02:08:46,170
Wait.

1803
02:08:46,910 --> 02:08:51,710
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in.

1804
02:08:51,970 --> 02:08:54,410
I had it, I had it, why did I lose it?

1805
02:08:54,410 --> 02:09:04,220
I wonder what XOF is thinking right now.

1806
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:08,780
Please!

1807
02:09:09,260 --> 02:09:10,300
How do I go down?

1808
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:14,120
Wait, what's the precision control?

1809
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:15,340
Whoa.

1810
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:18,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1811
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:20,200
Oh, yeah.

1812
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:21,560
How did I...

1813
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:22,800
How did I...

1814
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,040
Center off character off?

1815
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:25,840
No, that's what it needs to be.

1816
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:28,400
game screen is just like that.

1817
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:32,120
I just I had it and then I messed it up.

1818
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:36,980
Okay.

1819
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:45,960
XOF exists?

1820
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:46,880
Uh-oh.

1821
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,300
Someone didn't play five.

1822
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:49,700
It's okay.

1823
02:09:50,700 --> 02:09:52,220
Don't worry about it.

1824
02:09:54,980 --> 02:09:55,460
Art.

1825
02:09:56,360 --> 02:09:57,180
Oh, there we go.

1826
02:09:57,300 --> 02:09:57,900
I'm so stupid.

1827
02:09:58,200 --> 02:09:58,360
Thank you.

1828
02:09:58,420 --> 02:09:58,960
Yeah, it is.

1829
02:09:59,020 --> 02:09:59,300
Okay.

1830
02:09:59,480 --> 02:09:59,860
There we go.

1831
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:00,340
There we go.

1832
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:02,940
Oh, my gosh.

1833
02:10:08,830 --> 02:10:09,830
You mean me?

1834
02:10:10,850 --> 02:10:10,930
Yeah.

1835
02:10:11,390 --> 02:10:12,410
Oh, I guess.

1836
02:10:17,140 --> 02:10:19,000
I think this is as good as I'm going to get it.

1837
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:28,780
Go to sleep, little baby.

1838
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:30,660
Go to sleep.

1839
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:32,840
Little baby.

1840
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:34,440
It's a little baby.

1841
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:36,800
There's a little baby.

1842
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:38,240
It's a little baby.

1843
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:53,120
Snake sleeping face Snake sleeping face Snake sleeping face Wait I'm gonna have to I want to take off the face camel

1844
02:10:57,480 --> 02:11:04,540
Oh I can't because I'm asleep Never mind

1845
02:11:10,230 --> 02:11:16,290
Yeah I won't let me because I'm asleep Minto's creepy otaku laugh.

1846
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:21,690
He's also sleeping in the survival, was he?

1847
02:11:21,830 --> 02:11:22,650
I missed it.

1848
02:11:25,270 --> 02:11:26,370
I missed it then.

1849
02:11:26,870 --> 02:11:27,610
Wait, is it...

1850
02:11:27,610 --> 02:11:29,710
Wait, I didn't see him standing there, so he was dead.

1851
02:11:30,070 --> 02:11:31,190
He was just on the ground.

1852
02:11:34,110 --> 02:11:34,550
Paramedic.

1853
02:11:38,010 --> 02:11:38,450
Yeah.

1854
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:42,250
I ate one of those Spotsum mushrooms you were talking about.

1855
02:11:42,270 --> 02:12:40,030
about really how did it taste I passed out seriously seriously yeah so that's why they call it the bringer of sleep what oh I look the word Spotsa up afterwards and found out it means bringer of sleep in Russian well but anyway the reason the Spotsa puts you to sleep when you eat it is because it contains a type of anesthetic substance similar to an alkaloid maybe if you soak a handkerchief or something in it you could use it to put the enemy to sleep that's why i said i needed the anchor chip falling asleep might cause your life and stamina to recover as well why don't you find a safe spot and try it out ah that's why i said you need the handkerchief oh my goodness oh my goodness i love this game he's so like flat oh perfect have you considered making your own mgs lore or timeline video No!

1856
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:45,660
The right person to do so.

1857
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:49,120
Yeah.

1858
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:52,600
I miss, I miss, like, I don't know everything.

1859
02:12:53,160 --> 02:12:55,580
You know, I'm not afraid to admit that.

1860
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:56,500
Wait, where was I?

1861
02:12:56,580 --> 02:12:57,660
Oh, here it is.

1862
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:04,240
So, Snake fell asleep in his resort mascot costume.

1863
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,980
Yeah, there's so many details and I think, I think

1864
02:13:18,030 --> 02:13:20,810
I'm just not the right person to do it.

1865
02:13:20,890 --> 02:13:21,470
But that's okay.

1866
02:13:21,770 --> 02:13:23,770
I'm not like, uh, you know.

1867
02:13:28,950 --> 02:13:31,030
Wow, we've already gone through two bosses, you guys.

1868
02:13:31,810 --> 02:13:32,570
We're killing it.

1869
02:13:32,950 --> 02:13:34,130
And I'm killing this rat.

1870
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:37,550
Come here.

1871
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:45,470
Everything but the rat.

1872
02:13:53,690 --> 02:13:57,130
I know that there's easier ways to do this, but it's so much funny.

1873
02:13:59,510 --> 02:14:00,310
It's so...

1874
02:14:01,090 --> 02:14:02,270
It's so funny.

1875
02:14:02,910 --> 02:14:04,350
Wait, where is Agako then?

1876
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:17,710
Where is Agako then?

1877
02:14:18,550 --> 02:14:19,790
Maybe he is at the top.

1878
02:14:22,190 --> 02:14:23,630
Are we gonna gate her on the ladder?

1879
02:14:25,410 --> 02:14:26,210
You betcha.

1880
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:30,530
Oh, I can't believe we're here!

1881
02:14:34,310 --> 02:14:35,270
This is exciting.

1882
02:14:35,410 --> 02:14:37,950
I wonder what version it's gonna be if it'll be the original?

1883
02:14:38,030 --> 02:14:38,950
I wonder...

1884
02:14:38,970 --> 02:14:41,150
Yeah, if it'll be the original or the new one.

1885
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:49,630
And then, if it's the new one, I wonder if you play Legacy if it's the original.

1886
02:14:52,190 --> 02:14:52,990
Let's see.

1887
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:26,870
Searching, and I'll melt into you.

1888
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:32,680
What a fear in my heart.

1889
02:15:35,510 --> 02:15:38,310
But you're so supreme.

1890
02:15:40,590 --> 02:15:43,330
I'll give my life

1891
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:53,220
to you.

1892
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:58,180
In my time, there'll be

1893
02:16:05,780 --> 02:16:06,600
no...

1894
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:12,100
It's the way I flirt to you.

1895
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:19,920
I'm still in a dream.

1896
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:22,000
Snake eater.

1897
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:33,150
I'm still in our dream.

1898
02:16:34,050 --> 02:16:34,730
Snake Eater.

1899
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:42,030
Snake Eater.

1900
02:16:44,150 --> 02:16:46,130
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

1901
02:16:46,130 --> 02:16:46,690
Woohoo!

1902
02:16:49,710 --> 02:16:50,550
Awesome.

1903
02:16:52,450 --> 02:16:54,930
Still looking for Gokko.

1904
02:16:55,610 --> 02:16:57,070
I must have really missed him, huh?

1905
02:16:59,690 --> 02:17:00,890
Hi, Doc.

1906
02:17:01,170 --> 02:17:02,390
Hot dog indeed.

1907
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:04,400
Wait, unless he's here?

1908
02:17:08,750 --> 02:17:10,630
Wish it was twice as long, right?

1909
02:17:14,470 --> 02:17:15,650
What a thrill.

1910
02:17:27,380 --> 02:17:27,780
How?

1911
02:17:28,460 --> 02:17:28,760
Whoa.

1912
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:35,120
This area.

1913
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:37,280
We got birds.

1914
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:40,860
This game was the reason I got a PS2 back in the day.

1915
02:17:41,060 --> 02:17:42,060
Love it so much, right?

1916
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:44,960
Boss fight, ladder defeated.

1917
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:46,420
Is it that three bosses down?

1918
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:51,460
Oh wait, let me put my suppressor back on.

1919
02:17:55,140 --> 02:17:55,700
Okay.

1920
02:17:58,640 --> 02:18:01,040
I love that my camo is still 60 here.

1921
02:18:01,940 --> 02:18:03,200
It's kind of... 70?

1922
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:04,580
It's kind of insane.

1923
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:05,320
60?

1924
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:07,460
60 when I move?

1925
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:12,700
You think this guy's poisonous?

1926
02:18:18,670 --> 02:18:20,290
I wish I could get more ammo.

1927
02:18:23,010 --> 02:18:25,910
I kind of want to kill the guys here so the birds eat them.

1928
02:18:28,590 --> 02:18:29,630
Hug it.

1929
02:18:30,630 --> 02:18:34,190
Guys, I can never remember the difference between poisonous and venomous.

1930
02:18:35,630 --> 02:18:38,350
Would anyone care to explain to me?

1931
02:18:39,190 --> 02:18:40,330
Just a little explanation.

1932
02:18:40,530 --> 02:18:41,490
What's this hole here?

1933
02:18:41,610 --> 02:18:42,710
I've never seen this before.

1934
02:18:46,410 --> 02:18:48,230
The mountain croc, yeah.

1935
02:18:49,110 --> 02:18:50,610
Very dangerous in this region.

1936
02:18:55,510 --> 02:18:58,010
Poison as if consumed.

1937
02:19:03,130 --> 02:19:03,770
Thank you.

1938
02:19:06,010 --> 02:19:07,910
I don't think I've ever seen this hole before.

1939
02:19:14,170 --> 02:19:14,990
Where does it go?

1940
02:19:16,390 --> 02:19:16,770
Ah!

1941
02:19:18,150 --> 02:19:19,370
Am I lagging?

1942
02:19:20,850 --> 02:19:21,770
Just a tiny bit.

1943
02:19:27,340 --> 02:19:28,060
Exploration.

1944
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:34,500
Do you think you saw my snout?

1945
02:19:54,890 --> 02:19:56,370
That was a close one.

1946
02:19:59,950 --> 02:20:01,250
A chaff, nice.

1947
02:20:03,810 --> 02:20:05,330
That was a really close one.

1948
02:20:06,230 --> 02:20:07,050
That was scary.

1949
02:20:08,190 --> 02:20:08,870
That was scary.

1950
02:20:09,030 --> 02:20:09,930
How close that was.

1951
02:20:10,070 --> 02:20:10,690
Oh my gosh.

1952
02:20:12,230 --> 02:20:13,530
Oh, I think I got his radio.

1953
02:20:14,170 --> 02:20:14,870
That's kind of funny.

1954
02:20:18,510 --> 02:20:20,810
Um, can I go down?

1955
02:20:22,110 --> 02:20:23,770
Making sure there's no one else.

1956
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:28,230
I'm not feeding the birds today.

1957
02:20:35,350 --> 02:20:36,790
It's the way.

1958
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:41,660
No, no, no.

1959
02:20:42,360 --> 02:20:42,660
No!

1960
02:20:47,080 --> 02:20:47,620
Also,

1961
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:52,980
Sidorio, thank you so much for that!

1962
02:20:53,100 --> 02:20:53,960
Thank you!

1963
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:57,100
It was honor to meet you today.

1964
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:58,200
Thank you so much!

1965
02:20:58,400 --> 02:20:58,800
I'm sorry.

1966
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:01,160
It was so, it felt so short, but thank you, thank you.

1967
02:21:05,240 --> 02:21:06,920
I can't believe... Ah!

1968
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:11,160
Christian, thank you!

1969
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:11,860
Welcome to membership!

1970
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:15,820
Oh wait.

1971
02:21:16,380 --> 02:21:17,160
No, there's not.

1972
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:20,300
No, no, no, no.

1973
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:24,000
Why couldn't you be like this guy?

1974
02:21:26,220 --> 02:21:27,200
I'm almost out of bullets.

1975
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:31,220
I'm almost out of bullets.

1976
02:21:31,780 --> 02:21:32,220
This sucks.

1977
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:35,080
Sucks!

1978
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:42,930
They're stupid.

1979
02:21:43,730 --> 02:21:45,230
They're so dumb.

1980
02:21:45,510 --> 02:21:45,510
Ah,

1981
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:54,180
why would I?

1982
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:55,340
Why did I stare at it?

1983
02:21:55,800 --> 02:21:56,180
My bad.

1984
02:21:58,660 --> 02:21:59,440
Sorry, everybody.

1985
02:22:10,330 --> 02:22:10,950
So sorry.

1986
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:13,070
So sorry for the mishap.

1987
02:22:18,050 --> 02:22:22,470
So, so sorry for the mishap.

1988
02:22:23,150 --> 02:22:24,050
I hate this area.

1989
02:22:24,290 --> 02:22:25,830
Like, so much, actually.

1990
02:22:27,250 --> 02:22:28,750
And I become the Joker.

1991
02:22:29,870 --> 02:22:30,190
Here.

1992
02:22:36,140 --> 02:22:36,680
Why?

1993
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:37,180
Where?

1994
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:38,020
Where?

1995
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:38,280
Where?

1996
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:38,740
Think?

1997
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:39,240
No!

1998
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:40,000
What the?

1999
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:40,980
Oh my god.

2000
02:22:41,080 --> 02:22:43,360
Did I get bit by a stinking spider?

2001
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:46,400
My eyes.

2002
02:22:50,020 --> 02:22:51,040
Damn it.

2003
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:52,640
No, no, not rotten food.

2004
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:56,900
Food poisoning.

2005
02:22:57,620 --> 02:22:58,920
I like how serum doesn't...

2006
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:02,720
It's a scorpion!

2007
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:14,090
I hate this- Oh my god!

2008
02:23:14,350 --> 02:23:15,030
Oh my god!

2009
02:23:15,890 --> 02:23:16,990
Maybe I can get him.

2010
02:23:18,370 --> 02:23:19,050
With...

2011
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:20,590
The cigarette spray.

2012
02:23:30,930 --> 02:23:31,810
Equip spray?

2013
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:39,640
What's Lake Plasm?

2014
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:43,280
What do I not know?

2015
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:15,660
Nobody?

2016
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:21,920
Oh shoot, wait, this is not the hole that I was thinking of.

2017
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:23,080
HQ respond!

2018
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,720
Where's the hole I was- where's the crawl- where's the hole?

2019
02:24:28,420 --> 02:24:29,300
Oh, no!

2020
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:32,920
Um...

2021
02:24:55,410 --> 02:24:56,710
Oh, jeez.

2022
02:25:26,690 --> 02:25:28,270
Wait, they can see in here.

2023
02:25:31,470 --> 02:25:32,110
I'm hungry.

2024
02:25:32,390 --> 02:25:32,830
Okay, hold on.

2025
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:34,330
Actually, I'm kind of getting hungry.

2026
02:25:34,970 --> 02:25:35,410
For real.

2027
02:25:35,790 --> 02:25:36,790
I got a parrot!

2028
02:25:37,070 --> 02:25:38,630
This bird looks familiar.

2029
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:39,610
Woohoo!

2030
02:25:40,370 --> 02:25:40,710
Let's

2031
02:25:44,380 --> 02:25:45,220
eat the Mark War.

2032
02:25:46,100 --> 02:25:46,860
Mark War.

2033
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:50,660
Hey, this works.

2034
02:25:51,060 --> 02:25:51,960
Yeah, this works.

2035
02:25:55,770 --> 02:26:09,530
I I'm just spraying smoke everywhere Ah Ah Ah Ah

2036
02:26:20,020 --> 02:26:31,720
HQ This is HQ Patrol here We lost sight of the enemy Commence alert formation Acknowledged The enemy is standing behind

2037
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:39,260
Just a crack.

2038
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:42,860
I'm sweating so bad.

2039
02:26:43,300 --> 02:26:44,180
Holy moly.

2040
02:26:59,260 --> 02:27:00,900
Also, sorry I'm lagging a bit.

2041
02:27:01,020 --> 02:27:01,220
You know what?

2042
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:02,840
I'm gonna...

2043
02:27:07,060 --> 02:27:08,040
I think it's okay.

2044
02:27:14,220 --> 02:27:16,240
Let's just wait for the caution to go down.

2045
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:21,300
All in favor of the caution going down, Aye, aye!

2046
02:27:21,580 --> 02:27:22,640
Okay, majority boat.

2047
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:33,000
Oh,

2048
02:27:36,260 --> 02:27:38,020
yeah, we're gonna chill for a second.

2049
02:27:40,120 --> 02:27:40,800
Hmm.

2050
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:43,800
We only have...

2051
02:27:44,360 --> 02:27:48,600
We have one more Sons of the Boss left.

2052
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:50,020
Which is pretty exciting.

2053
02:27:50,580 --> 02:27:51,920
Hydration time, exactly.

2054
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:53,780
Froggy!

Thank you.

Maybe I was getting a little over What's the word?

2058
02:28:10,480 --> 02:28:11,820
Optimistic?

2059
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:19,200

2060
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:20,360

Who saw me?

2067
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:03,040
Please, please go away.

2068
02:30:10,830 --> 02:30:13,010
I can't believe I only have three bullets left.

2069
02:30:14,170 --> 02:30:15,070
This really sucks.

2070
02:30:20,590 --> 02:30:21,950
This is really bad.

2071
02:30:27,400 --> 02:30:29,220
This is like so bad.

2072
02:30:36,060 --> 02:30:37,600
Yeah, you're just seeing things.

2073
02:30:51,430 --> 02:30:52,770
Like, I can't miss.

2074
02:30:53,610 --> 02:30:54,270
Don't miss.

2075
02:30:55,930 --> 02:30:56,190
Ah!

2076
02:30:58,420 --> 02:30:58,800
Oh!

2077
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:15,480
I don't know why I don't use first-person view more often.

2078
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:16,460
What's wrong with me?

2079
02:31:20,380 --> 02:31:21,480
Please, baby.

2080
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:22,880
No!

2081
02:31:24,860 --> 02:31:26,360
I'm in pain!

2082
02:31:30,440 --> 02:31:32,500
I'm in Spain without the us!

2083
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:35,900
Do people still say that?

2084
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:42,600
No!

2085
02:31:55,650 --> 02:31:56,510
Please!

2086
02:31:57,990 --> 02:31:58,350
No!

2087
02:32:01,990 --> 02:32:02,850
No!

2088
02:32:03,750 --> 02:32:04,990
This game hates me?

2089
02:32:06,110 --> 02:32:06,990
Okay, that's a bush.

2090
02:32:07,970 --> 02:32:08,570
Not a person.

2091
02:32:11,940 --> 02:32:13,080
Oh, what's in here?

2092
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:13,540
Wait.

2093
02:32:15,260 --> 02:32:15,720
Oh!

2094
02:32:20,060 --> 02:32:22,620
Wait, if I go into photo mode here...

2095
02:32:24,340 --> 02:32:27,280
Oh, because I'm like stuck in here, it won't let me...

2096
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:28,860
Sweet baby.

2097
02:32:32,740 --> 02:32:33,780
Sweet baby.

2098
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:44,730
I think a guy comes down here.

2099
02:32:44,830 --> 02:32:46,070
I just can't remember when.

2100
02:32:46,870 --> 02:32:47,950
Unless it's the guy I got.

2101
02:32:48,210 --> 02:32:48,710
Who knows?

2102
02:32:49,170 --> 02:32:49,970
Wait, another hole?

2103
02:32:51,350 --> 02:32:51,450
Please.

2104
02:32:54,910 --> 02:32:55,130
No!

2105
02:33:01,290 --> 02:33:02,330
One shot.

2106
02:33:04,770 --> 02:33:05,810
Enough to...

2107
02:33:11,010 --> 02:33:11,970
Enough to...

2108
02:33:11,970 --> 02:33:12,970
Enough to...

2109
02:33:21,210 --> 02:33:22,490
Enough to...

2110
02:33:29,240 --> 02:33:32,540
I could have probably CQC at him, but that's fine.

2111
02:33:41,480 --> 02:33:41,640
No!

2112
02:33:44,240 --> 02:33:45,860
Game, I'm begging you!

2113
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:50,700
I'm begging you!

2114
02:33:53,060 --> 02:33:53,700
Shit.

2115
02:34:02,030 --> 02:34:04,030
The game is really...

2116
02:34:05,230 --> 02:34:05,950
Really...

2117
02:34:05,950 --> 02:34:09,070
Making it difficult for me.

2118
02:34:10,670 --> 02:34:12,250
I mean, this area sucks enough.

2119
02:34:13,450 --> 02:34:15,550
I don't want to be here.

2120
02:34:17,130 --> 02:34:21,330
And if I die, I have to do it all over again.

2121
02:34:22,130 --> 02:34:23,850
This ammo gotcha is funny.

2122
02:34:24,090 --> 02:34:25,190
Yeah, it's so...

2123
02:34:26,030 --> 02:34:26,490
Ah!

2124
02:34:28,910 --> 02:34:29,630
Ouch!

2125
02:34:32,390 --> 02:34:33,070
Excited,

2126
02:34:40,630 --> 02:34:41,450
requesting backup.

2127
02:34:41,550 --> 02:34:41,970
Ah.

2128
02:34:43,770 --> 02:34:44,450
Oh.

2129
02:34:45,550 --> 02:34:45,830
Oh.

2130
02:34:45,830 --> 02:34:46,690
No, God, no.

2131
02:34:59,250 --> 02:35:00,610
Everything's fine.

2132
02:35:03,430 --> 02:35:08,730
I die, I die here instead.

2133
02:35:09,650 --> 02:35:10,790
This is way better!

2134
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:34,460
These are the strongest, the strongest ever!

2135
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:35,900
Wait, hold on.

2136
02:35:37,060 --> 02:35:38,480
Oh, but I don't want to die there.

2137
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:43,720
Wait, so what I was thinking was I go back and I try for loot.

2138
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:48,100
But I don't want to die there either.

2139
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:50,540
Because then I think I died at the beginning of the map.

2140
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:52,640
I love the powerful boxes.

2141
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:53,540
I'm a fan.

2142
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:54,600
I'm a really big fan.

2143
02:35:56,380 --> 02:35:57,940
I'm a really big fan.

2144
02:36:03,310 --> 02:36:03,710
Wait!

2145
02:36:05,810 --> 02:36:06,810
Wait, look at...

2146
02:36:06,810 --> 02:36:08,250
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2147
02:36:10,850 --> 02:36:12,450
Sorry, I'm doing this for Sonic.

2148
02:36:13,490 --> 02:36:13,930
It's for science.

2149
02:36:15,650 --> 02:36:16,090
Wow.

2150
02:36:17,870 --> 02:36:18,750
Oh wow.

2151
02:36:19,710 --> 02:36:20,870
It's for science.

2152
02:36:23,670 --> 02:36:24,550
Oh my...

2153
02:36:24,550 --> 02:36:26,710
Wait, what did I do to my arm?

2154
02:36:29,310 --> 02:36:29,750
Twice!

2155
02:36:31,010 --> 02:36:32,370
What did I do there?

2156
02:36:36,710 --> 02:36:39,050
It's the scarring system, guys.

2157
02:36:39,270 --> 02:36:40,770
Wait, maybe that's the fire.

2158
02:36:40,870 --> 02:36:42,330
I think that's when I was on fire.

2159
02:36:46,490 --> 02:36:56,380
oh look there's a bullet there's a couple bullet walls wait it's actually working

And she'll be like, ah, no snake.

2163
02:38:43,780 --> 02:38:45,660
I'm not opening up the door for you, stupid.

2164
02:38:47,380 --> 02:38:48,400
Eva won't talk to me.

2165
02:38:48,480 --> 02:38:49,460
She hates me.

2166
02:38:54,040 --> 02:38:55,840
Now we need to go up there.

2167
02:38:56,360 --> 02:39:01,760
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

2168
02:39:05,050 --> 02:39:05,210

HQ.

2170
02:39:07,750 --> 02:39:08,290
This is HQ.

2171
02:39:11,820 --> 02:39:13,160
We've lost sight of the intruder.

2172
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:14,240
Going into high alert.

2173
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:16,040
I can go in caution though, right?

2174
02:39:16,180 --> 02:39:16,980
Or is it just...

2175
02:39:18,540 --> 02:39:29,190
alert I can't remember call zero for the heartbeat I didn't hack the thing I can't call for my own

2176
02:39:33,060 --> 02:39:54,940
you can during caution okay that's what I thought I was like I don't think you can during surprisingly my health is like so good though I don't know how I don't know how we made it everybody but somehow we did it what's a Better camouflage.

2177
02:39:56,020 --> 02:39:56,900
Chocolate chip!

2178
02:39:57,140 --> 02:39:57,560
Wait!

2179
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,600
I want to wear this one and call Siggint.

2180
02:40:00,780 --> 02:40:02,500
Well, I think they'll...

2181
02:40:02,500 --> 02:40:04,240
We have many things with Siggint.

2182
02:40:04,680 --> 02:40:06,420
He might be like...

2183
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:13,060
Siggint, the chopper we were talking about, is flying around.

2184
02:40:13,520 --> 02:40:13,560
Yeah.

2185
02:40:13,940 --> 02:40:14,820
The one at the heliport?

2186
02:40:15,340 --> 02:40:15,500
Yeah.

2187
02:40:15,500 --> 02:40:16,420
We should have blown it up.

2188
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:19,180
Perhaps it's an armed variation of the MIH hip.

2189
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:19,980
No.

2190
02:40:20,680 --> 02:40:23,680
Some of it looks the same, but the overall shape is different.

2191
02:40:23,780 --> 02:40:24,520
Yeah, I tried to blow it up.

2192
02:40:24,780 --> 02:41:30,700
stub wings and the cockpit canopy looks like an angular greenhouse sir it gives you the fury there must be some kind of new model i've heard stories recently that the soviets are developing a flying infantry combat vehicle that's got to be it a flying infantry combat vehicle a hind a transport chopper with carrying capabilities think of it as an attack transport chopper version of france's amx vci or the soviet bmp they must be doing field tests on the initial generation chopper that's a little smaller than the hip maybe we should call it a hind hmm not bad is cool with me then it's settled we'll refer to that new type helicopter snake your hind is not smaller than your hips oh buddy anyway the hind is armed with a 12.7 millimeter machine gun on the nose and rocket pods and anti-tank missiles on the stub wing hardpoints normally you'd be crazy to try and fight it on foot if it starts attacking with the machine gun or the rockets take cover behind something as fast as you can as for the

2193
02:41:30,700 --> 02:41:49,500
missiles you should be able to knock out their guidance system by using a chaff grenade to block the radio signal wait I have those I do I do I need to get let's see

2194
02:41:53,460 --> 02:41:55,640
I'm gonna get his ankles

2195
02:42:12,410 --> 02:42:18,190
With the snake call the fluffy accumulation of fibers on his freshly washed maid dress.

2196
02:42:19,270 --> 02:42:20,230
That's maid lint.

2197
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:40,500
Anyways, guys, how are we doing today?

2198
02:42:49,530 --> 02:42:50,290
I'm peeking?

2199
02:42:51,610 --> 02:42:54,410
If we can go during caution, we might...

2200
02:42:54,410 --> 02:42:55,390
Might be okay.

2201
02:42:56,790 --> 02:42:58,630
If not, I hide in the hidey hole again.

2202
02:42:59,330 --> 02:42:59,870
Climb, please.

2203
02:43:01,110 --> 02:43:02,010
I saw something.

2204
02:43:02,150 --> 02:43:02,830
No, you didn't.

2205
02:43:03,270 --> 02:43:04,430
No, you freaking didn't.

2206
02:43:06,710 --> 02:43:07,550
Uh, wait.

2207
02:43:15,560 --> 02:43:17,120
The tried and true.

2208
02:43:29,270 --> 02:43:31,170
Happy to enjoy some Metal Gear Saturday on my birthday!

2209
02:43:31,510 --> 02:43:31,950
Takis!

2210
02:43:33,190 --> 02:43:34,070
Happy birthday!

2211
02:43:34,830 --> 02:43:35,590
Happy happy birthday!

2212
02:43:37,310 --> 02:43:38,090
This is HQ.

2213
02:43:38,930 --> 02:43:40,570
Thank you for the super time!

2214
02:43:41,930 --> 02:43:43,190
Thank you, thank you!

2215
02:43:43,670 --> 02:43:44,830
We gotta go, okay, hold on.

2216
02:43:45,890 --> 02:43:46,650
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2217
02:43:46,670 --> 02:43:49,430
Thank you, we gotta go around...

2218
02:43:49,430 --> 02:43:52,250
I hate this area so much.

2219
02:43:54,550 --> 02:43:56,070
No problems detected.

2220
02:43:59,170 --> 02:43:59,290
I

2221
02:44:05,360 --> 02:44:08,300
like how for this, it kind of...

2222
02:44:08,300 --> 02:44:11,600
It's very similar to how it was in...

2223
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:13,980
in V when you take on...

2224
02:44:13,980 --> 02:44:15,000
When you put on and...

2225
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:15,920
Oh, nice.

2226
02:44:17,660 --> 02:44:20,640
When you put on and off the box...

2227
02:44:27,140 --> 02:44:28,880
Wait, can I get it?

2228
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:32,460
My camera is like kind of stuck.

2229
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:33,220
Maybe not.

2230
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:35,400
Dang it, I wanted his little face.

2231
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:36,740
It's so cute.

2232
02:44:45,370 --> 02:44:45,970
Alrighty.

2233
02:44:47,890 --> 02:44:48,570
Alrighty.

2234
02:44:52,050 --> 02:44:53,710
We're almost there-ish.

2235
02:44:54,030 --> 02:44:55,170
Look at this!

2236
02:44:55,570 --> 02:44:59,050
Look at this bandana!

2237
02:44:59,510 --> 02:45:01,610
Why is- wait, bunny ears.

2238
02:45:06,390 --> 02:45:08,370
Snake has bunny ears.

2239
02:45:08,510 --> 02:45:08,950
Wasamimi?

2240
02:45:12,110 --> 02:45:12,810
Wasamimi?

2241
02:45:15,610 --> 02:45:16,310
Wasamimi?

2242
02:45:25,380 --> 02:45:26,780
So cute!

2243
02:45:27,560 --> 02:45:27,920
Snake!

2244
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:31,860
I'm trying to get in there.

2245
02:45:32,220 --> 02:45:33,180
I kind of want them...

2246
02:45:33,180 --> 02:45:33,600
There we go!

2247
02:45:33,720 --> 02:45:34,060
There we go!

2248
02:45:40,820 --> 02:45:41,440
Cute!

2249
02:45:41,800 --> 02:45:42,540
So cute!

2250
02:45:55,250 --> 02:45:56,490
I wish...

2251
02:45:58,240 --> 02:46:00,260
I could try stun grenade.

2252
02:46:00,740 --> 02:46:01,580
Or smoke grenade!

2253
02:46:01,860 --> 02:46:03,740
And I could like run up and CQC him.

2254
02:46:10,080 --> 02:46:14,160
Stun grenade might be safer, but people will hear it.

2255
02:46:22,090 --> 02:46:23,730
Chaff can cut off the radio.

2256
02:46:23,870 --> 02:46:24,330
Yeah.

2257
02:46:33,460 --> 02:46:35,220
I don't know if he comes up or not.

2258
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:36,760
The guy that was just walking.

2259
02:46:38,800 --> 02:46:39,780
It's a mystery.

2260
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:41,060
Oh, there he is.

2261
02:46:41,300 --> 02:46:41,780
Okay, it doesn't.

2262
02:46:45,480 --> 02:46:47,200
This feels a little tricky.

2263
02:46:49,440 --> 02:46:49,740
Spoiler.

2264
02:47:02,620 --> 02:47:03,860
Shaft and stun him.

2265
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:05,780
Look at that bug.

2266
02:47:11,890 --> 02:47:13,050
Where did he go anyway?

2267
02:47:13,690 --> 02:47:14,370
Oh, there he is.

2268
02:47:14,490 --> 02:47:14,670
Okay.

2269
02:47:16,310 --> 02:47:17,490
just go behind them.

2270
02:47:20,730 --> 02:47:21,990
He might not be able to...

2271
02:47:21,990 --> 02:47:22,790
Oh, never mind.

2272
02:47:39,580 --> 02:47:39,920
Wait.

2273
02:47:40,340 --> 02:47:41,260
Do I have to go up here?

2274
02:47:46,860 --> 02:47:47,460
Uh...

2275
02:47:47,460 --> 02:47:50,180
Do I go through the underground?

2276
02:47:50,440 --> 02:47:52,160
Ah, I can't remember.

2277
02:47:53,880 --> 02:47:54,480
I'll...

2278
02:47:54,480 --> 02:47:55,060
Some universe.

2279
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:57,820
I hope every time we sneeze is an obsessive cute girl.

2280
02:47:58,320 --> 02:48:02,420
Ghost girl taking photos of us because of this honorary fashion movie.

2281
02:48:04,180 --> 02:48:05,300
Do I

2282
02:48:13,490 --> 02:48:18,890
go down in here or do I, uh, I, uh, which way is it?

2283
02:48:20,290 --> 02:48:22,790
It's not that room right there, for sure.

2284
02:48:23,450 --> 02:48:23,670
No?

2285
02:48:24,930 --> 02:48:25,490
Yeah.

2286
02:48:27,710 --> 02:48:30,330
Um, so I can't read the map.

2287
02:48:34,230 --> 02:48:36,750
Just be safe to go through this pathway.

2288
02:48:40,560 --> 02:48:42,960
I think I'm 80% camel, right?

2289
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:47,060
Let's... wait for this guy to leave?

2290
02:48:47,900 --> 02:48:48,300
Maybe?

2291
02:48:50,340 --> 02:48:52,080
It's to the right of that room.

2292
02:48:52,420 --> 02:48:53,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2293
02:48:53,220 --> 02:48:54,500
It's like up there.

2294
02:48:57,440 --> 02:48:59,460
So I'm... I'm dumb.

2295
02:49:03,560 --> 02:49:05,560
How can he see me?

2296
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:06,700
Blind?

2297
02:49:08,360 --> 02:49:09,420
Don't jinx myself.

2298
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:10,460
Please don't jinx myself.

2299
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:11,720
Please don't...

2300
02:49:13,860 --> 02:49:14,460
Okay.

2301
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:16,800
I'm gonna go.

2302
02:49:53,050 --> 02:49:54,370
I don't know which one to use!

2303
02:49:54,690 --> 02:49:58,690
I don't know which one to use!

2304
02:50:02,210 --> 02:50:03,710
I don't think it'll hold him up.

2305
02:50:04,050 --> 02:50:04,750
I'm not sure.

2306
02:50:10,220 --> 02:50:10,620
CQC?

2307
02:50:12,840 --> 02:50:13,240
Yeah.

2308
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:14,460
Damn

2309
02:50:21,210 --> 02:50:21,450
it.

2310
02:50:21,790 --> 02:50:23,110
Oh wait, I think we're okay.

2311
02:50:26,850 --> 02:50:27,870
Where the hell am I?

2312
02:50:28,710 --> 02:50:30,110
Ah, I need to go this way.

2313
02:50:30,310 --> 02:50:30,490
Okay.

2314
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:47,580
Nothing at all.

2315
02:50:52,020 --> 02:50:52,610
Wait.

2316
02:50:53,330 --> 02:50:55,850
We must put on our best for Miss Eva!

2317
02:50:58,050 --> 02:50:59,630
No way!

2318
02:51:01,990 --> 02:51:07,270
Who dies

2319
02:51:19,510 --> 02:51:20,370
on the shoes?

2320
02:51:23,470 --> 02:51:25,410
No way!

2321
02:51:25,950 --> 02:51:26,150
Oh!

2322
02:51:35,130 --> 02:52:01,910

2324
02:52:22,500 --> 02:52:29,660
where'd you get this one i got it after defecting to the soviet union sorry i just i saw a tummy and It's older than that.

2325
02:52:30,840 --> 02:52:32,460
Code-breaking is a desk job.

2326
02:52:32,900 --> 02:52:34,100
Where'd you get this kind of scar?

2327
02:52:34,440 --> 02:52:35,360
You really want to know?

2328
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:37,560
How'd you get those scars?

2329
02:52:38,500 --> 02:52:40,080
Well, too bad.

2330
02:52:41,160 --> 02:52:41,540
Hmm.

2331
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:44,540
A girl's got to have some secrets, you know.

2332
02:52:46,880 --> 02:52:48,000
But enough about that.

2333
02:52:48,160 --> 02:52:48,920
You've got to get going.

2334
02:52:49,060 --> 02:52:51,360
The Phase 2 trial of the Shaggleheart is about to start.

2335
02:52:51,560 --> 02:52:53,780
And it looks like someone might be coming to spoil the party.

2336
02:52:55,040 --> 02:52:55,440
Khrushchev?

2337
02:52:56,240 --> 02:52:57,980
His forces are on their way here.

2338
02:52:58,800 --> 02:52:59,980
He looks so dapper.

2339
02:53:00,860 --> 02:53:01,180
He looks so dapper.

2340
02:53:01,540 --> 02:53:06,920
If we don't get a move on, the security will be even tighter than it is now.

2341
02:53:09,640 --> 02:53:10,460
You'll need this key.

2342
02:53:10,800 --> 02:53:11,380
Oh, thank you.

2343
02:53:11,600 --> 02:53:13,500
It unlocks the door to the underground tunnel.

2344
02:53:14,380 --> 02:53:17,520
Once you're in there, you can follow the tunnel to get inside Groznygrad.

2345
02:53:19,060 --> 02:53:19,960
And take this too.

2346
02:53:20,860 --> 02:53:21,300
Robin!

2347
02:53:23,800 --> 02:53:24,700
What is it?

2348
02:53:25,480 --> 02:53:26,780
The food of the future.

2349
02:53:27,160 --> 02:53:28,560
A well-balanced meal for the space.

2350
02:53:30,560 --> 02:53:33,580
It looks like he's kissing it sometimes.

2351
02:53:36,320 --> 02:53:38,180
Oh my god.

2352
02:53:39,260 --> 02:53:39,500
Wait.

2353
02:53:39,900 --> 02:53:41,200
I'll bet if I kissed you.

2354
02:53:42,080 --> 02:53:44,420
You taste like a wild beast.

2355
02:53:49,950 --> 02:53:54,270
Do you know where exactly in Groznygrad, Sokolov is located?

2356
02:53:54,870 --> 02:53:57,090
He's in the heart of the fortress, the Weapons Lab.

2357
02:53:58,290 --> 02:54:01,050
The Weapons Lab is divided into three wings.

2358
02:54:02,350 --> 02:54:05,010
There's the East Wing, which houses the research facilities.

2359
02:54:06,470 --> 02:54:08,810
Then there's the main wing where the weapons are assembled.

2360
02:54:09,110 --> 02:54:10,590
That's where the Shagahod is.

2361
02:54:12,330 --> 02:54:15,910
Finally, there's the West Wing, which is connected via a passageway to the main building.

2362
02:54:16,190 --> 02:54:19,390
When Eva zips up her suit, it's like a reverse parry, the pilot was.

2363
02:54:19,390 --> 02:54:22,010
To get in, you'll have to enter the main wing from the East Wing.

2364
02:54:22,870 --> 02:54:26,090
Then, go through the passageway on the second floor of the main wing.

2365
02:54:26,950 --> 02:54:28,650
The West Wing of the weapons lab.

2366
02:54:29,190 --> 02:54:29,630
Got it.

2367
02:54:29,790 --> 02:54:30,310
Got it.

2368
02:54:31,530 --> 02:54:32,330
Pretty sure he takes it.

2369
02:54:32,350 --> 02:54:33,270
It's like...

2370
02:54:33,270 --> 02:54:33,910
Crack.

2371
02:54:34,130 --> 02:54:34,750
Not again.

2372
02:54:35,470 --> 02:54:36,430
It's a load of crack.

2373
02:54:36,430 --> 02:54:38,150
The West Wing is protected by the highest level of security.

2374
02:54:38,470 --> 02:54:40,170
You need to be Colonel Class to get in.

2375
02:54:40,730 --> 02:54:41,770
Colonel Class.

2376
02:54:42,870 --> 02:54:43,090
Here.

2377
02:54:43,950 --> 02:54:44,750
Look at this picture.

2378
02:54:44,870 --> 02:54:45,950
Look at them!

2379
02:54:46,370 --> 02:54:48,170
Major Ivan Rydenovich Rykov.

2380
02:54:49,390 --> 02:54:50,290
Pretend you're him.

2381
02:54:50,670 --> 02:54:51,030
Wait.

2382
02:54:51,030 --> 02:54:52,010
How do I do that?

2383
02:54:52,290 --> 02:54:53,310
I'm sorry.

2384
02:54:53,510 --> 02:54:58,790
He's looking into Vulcan's eyes so like...

2385
02:54:59,170 --> 02:55:00,050
Steal his clothes.

2386
02:55:00,530 --> 02:55:00,930
Woo!

2387
02:55:01,390 --> 02:55:02,330
You look similar.

2388
02:55:02,350 --> 02:55:37,390
from behind they won't know the difference your face might be a problem so you just have to figure something out he should be somewhere in the east way gosh could you approve with a three hour oh gosh oh right but how am i supposed to escape once i get so glob out of there i love how he looks command said you're supposed to have something ready for me and i do There's a lake 30 miles north of here.

2389
02:55:39,230 --> 02:55:40,470
I hit a wig there.

2390
02:55:41,050 --> 02:55:41,670
A wig?

2391
02:55:42,230 --> 02:55:44,630
It's a state-of-the-art ground effect vehicle.

2392
02:55:45,510 --> 02:55:46,490
The ground effect?

2393
02:55:46,610 --> 02:55:49,690
I'm sorry, I know the screenshot effect is so annoying sounding.

2394
02:55:50,570 --> 02:55:50,990
That's okay.

2395
02:55:51,830 --> 02:55:53,630
I happen to be an excellent pilot.

2396
02:55:53,910 --> 02:55:54,970
Yes, ma'am!

2397
02:55:55,050 --> 02:55:57,310
Taking off from a lake is trickier than it looks.

2398
02:55:57,670 --> 02:55:59,190
It's not like riding a motorcycle.

2399
02:55:59,390 --> 02:56:00,830
You've got to be more delicate.

2400
02:56:01,250 --> 02:56:01,890
Of course I will.

2401
02:56:01,990 --> 02:56:03,670
You've seen how good I am with the bike, right?

2402
02:56:09,930 --> 02:56:10,490
Right.

2403
02:56:11,330 --> 02:56:12,650
You handle the escape, then.

2404
02:56:12,970 --> 02:56:14,230
I'll head for Groznikrad.

2405
02:56:16,190 --> 02:56:16,610
Wait a minute.

2406
02:56:17,750 --> 02:56:19,310
There's something I wanted to ask you.

2407
02:56:21,530 --> 02:56:23,530
I love every time the Croft hat goes...

2408
02:56:23,530 --> 02:56:24,690
What's the story between you and the boss?

2409
02:56:26,070 --> 02:56:28,930
She was like a mother, and my master.

2410
02:56:30,450 --> 02:56:31,190
And your lover?

2411
02:56:32,210 --> 02:56:33,810
It went deeper than that.

2412
02:56:34,450 --> 02:56:34,890
Deeper?

2413
02:56:37,250 --> 02:57:04,690
half of me belongs to the boss do you love her no nothing like that do you hate her does it have to be one or the other I'm too sad love or hate to laugh no between a man and a woman oh my goodness you bet never mind for 10 years we lived and died together you couldn't possibly understand and you think you

2414
02:57:08,830 --> 02:57:11,770
It like covers up everything.

2415
02:57:12,250 --> 02:57:13,930
Assassinating the boss.

2416
02:57:15,990 --> 02:57:18,810
Oh, this music makes me so sad though.

2417
02:57:21,230 --> 02:57:23,410
This music makes me so sad.

2418
02:57:26,590 --> 02:57:29,550
Snake, is there anyone you like?

2419
02:57:30,030 --> 02:57:30,710
Someone special?

2420
02:57:33,290 --> 02:57:36,390
I've never been interested in other people's lives.

2421
02:57:37,290 --> 02:57:38,090
I'm so sorry.

2422
02:57:38,150 --> 02:57:39,450
You were interested in the boss.

2423
02:57:39,830 --> 02:57:40,990
Stop, I'll stop, I'll stop.

2424
02:57:41,750 --> 02:57:42,670
She was different.

2425
02:57:44,310 --> 02:57:44,710
Really?

2426
02:57:45,930 --> 02:57:47,810
How do you feel about me?

2427
02:57:49,070 --> 02:57:50,590
I should be asking you the same question.

2428
02:57:52,410 --> 02:57:55,430
I can fall in love if it's part of the mission.

2429
02:57:56,070 --> 02:57:58,430
Holy moly, she's just...

2430
02:57:58,430 --> 02:57:59,890
Even with you.

2431
02:58:02,930 --> 02:58:03,490
Wow.

2432
02:58:09,900 --> 02:58:10,460
Snake?

2433
02:58:27,750 --> 02:58:37,190
his lips were so tender what's his what's the skin drop the skincare routine king

2434
02:58:45,140 --> 02:58:50,600

2436
02:59:04,940 --> 02:59:06,380
She looks so good.

2437
02:59:06,580 --> 02:59:08,620
They're not stupid, and they know there's a spy.

2438
02:59:08,900 --> 02:59:11,120
I mean, I know she's beautiful in the first game, too.

2439
02:59:11,480 --> 02:59:13,180
We're original, but...

2440
02:59:13,180 --> 02:59:13,340
Good.

2441
02:59:13,800 --> 02:59:15,500
God, she looks so good.

2442
02:59:20,100 --> 02:59:21,280
She looks just like...

2443
02:59:21,280 --> 02:59:21,940
Oh, yeah!

2444
02:59:25,020 --> 02:59:25,980
Oh, yeah!

2445
02:59:31,790 --> 02:59:32,270
Oh!

2446
02:59:34,050 --> 02:59:35,590
I can't stop laughing.

2447
02:59:40,130 --> 02:59:41,490
Crop cat off.

2448
02:59:41,870 --> 02:59:43,310
Crop cap on or off?

2449
02:59:43,630 --> 02:59:44,330
Off please.

2450
02:59:44,830 --> 02:59:45,550
Too bad.

2451
02:59:47,410 --> 02:59:48,790
We put on our suit?

2452
02:59:50,270 --> 02:59:52,230
It was enough to get her to kiss us.

2453
03:00:04,960 --> 03:00:05,840
Uh oh.

2454
03:00:07,260 --> 03:00:08,180
Baby's angry.

2455
03:00:08,380 --> 03:00:09,040
Baby rage.

2456
03:00:12,040 --> 03:00:20,000
Wait, I'm going to see him again.

2457
03:00:20,600 --> 03:00:22,340
Oh, it's been so long.

2458
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:33,360
Nice shoes.

2459
03:00:36,810 --> 03:00:38,230
Can you talk?

2460
03:00:40,290 --> 03:00:42,990
No, he died before I could get it out of him.

2461
03:00:48,660 --> 03:00:51,520
yikes it looks like was it the spy then

2462
03:00:59,380 --> 03:01:07,900
oh look at this a transmitter exactly planted to keep someone informed of his location

2463
03:01:13,520 --> 03:01:45,420
but you can't handle the spy sauce does this mean glannon was the spy perhaps he was being used by someone else perhaps this man was our comrade comrade or not he's of no use to us now I don't approve of your methods I don't need your approval I'm in command here and that nuclear shell still feeling sore about that are you what What are you gonna do?

2464
03:01:45,700 --> 03:01:46,920
Report it to the authorities?

2465
03:01:49,720 --> 03:01:50,880
This is war, Major.

2466
03:01:51,620 --> 03:01:55,400
The Cold War, fought with information and espionage.

2467
03:01:56,700 --> 03:01:59,120
We must root out spies wherever they hide.

2468
03:02:00,580 --> 03:02:02,260
It is killed or be killed.

2469
03:02:03,320 --> 03:02:05,280
Potential threats must be weeded out.

2470
03:02:06,980 --> 03:02:09,640
Your feelings are a menace to the unity of our organization.

2471
03:02:10,840 --> 03:02:12,780
Someone is guiding the enemy's hand.

2472
03:02:14,680 --> 03:02:46,260
can only accomplish so much make no mistake there is a spy among us but casting suspicion on our own comrades see three explosives have been stolen you think it was the American no he could not have reached this fortress yet then who I'd be careful about suspecting boss such a lust for espionage where have you been Toilet,

2473
03:02:46,260 --> 03:02:49,680
the fear and the end have fallen.

2474
03:02:57,510 --> 03:02:59,950
Baby rage, baby rage, baby rage!

2475
03:03:04,310 --> 03:03:08,730
CIA dog, that leaves only the fury.

2476
03:03:09,210 --> 03:03:10,090
Oh yeah, I know.

2477
03:03:10,330 --> 03:03:12,770
How can the legendary Cobras be beaten so easily?

2478
03:03:14,230 --> 03:03:14,890
He's good.

2479
03:03:15,130 --> 03:03:15,690
Oh, God!

2480
03:03:15,970 --> 03:03:16,430
Look at him!

2481
03:03:17,570 --> 03:03:18,410
Fallen for him.

2482
03:03:18,410 --> 03:03:18,850
Ah!

2483
03:03:19,230 --> 03:03:19,390
Ah!

2484
03:03:21,730 --> 03:03:22,730
Don't worry.

2485
03:03:23,590 --> 03:03:24,620
I'll take care of him.

2486
03:03:26,410 --> 03:03:27,370
What is he after?

2487
03:03:27,790 --> 03:03:30,210
He must be more than just so long.

2488
03:03:31,670 --> 03:03:35,510
America is out to destroy the Shagohad and get its hands on your inheritance.

2489
03:03:37,770 --> 03:03:39,110
The Philosopher's Legacy.

2490
03:03:41,350 --> 03:03:41,970
Impossible.

2491
03:03:42,630 --> 03:03:43,250
The Legacy.

2492
03:03:44,110 --> 03:03:44,610
It...

2493
03:03:45,810 --> 03:03:47,050
It what?

2494
03:03:47,110 --> 03:03:48,770
Then they're out to kill me as well.

2495
03:03:49,310 --> 03:03:49,930
Boss.

2496
03:03:50,470 --> 03:03:52,470
Colonel, tighten the security on this place.

2497
03:03:52,490 --> 03:03:54,030
I just noticed she has like a mole under her eye.

2498
03:03:54,050 --> 03:03:54,830
He's coming here.

2499
03:03:54,910 --> 03:03:55,630
I'm sure of it.

2500
03:03:59,550 --> 03:04:01,370
I'm gonna get the Davy Crockett.

2501
03:04:09,920 --> 03:04:10,820
Fallen for him.

2502
03:04:10,860 --> 03:04:12,360
Why do you have to say that, huh?

2503
03:04:15,140 --> 03:04:17,140
Tatiana, you're so beautiful again today.

2504
03:04:19,820 --> 03:04:20,520
Steph, Steph.

2505
03:04:21,060 --> 03:04:22,320
Steph, Steph, Steph, Steph.

2506
03:04:22,920 --> 03:04:23,380
Steph, Steph, Steph.

2507
03:04:25,960 --> 03:04:28,340
Snuff, snuff, snuff, snuff.

2508
03:04:29,320 --> 03:04:30,120
Perfume.

2509
03:04:33,720 --> 03:04:34,240
Hmm.

2510
03:04:35,560 --> 03:04:36,540
What's wrong with perfume?

2511
03:04:39,620 --> 03:04:41,100
Smells like crock.

2512
03:04:42,120 --> 03:04:45,400
It's not perfume, it's cologne from our suit.

2513
03:04:53,140 --> 03:04:54,540
Nice boots.

2514
03:04:58,490 --> 03:05:00,870
Make sure you polish them up properly.

2515
03:05:02,990 --> 03:05:04,950
Yeah, maintain your image.

2516
03:05:16,990 --> 03:05:19,150
I love the way she makes fun of him.

2517
03:05:19,750 --> 03:05:20,990
It's so good.

2518
03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:29,040
Goodness gracious.

2519
03:05:32,220 --> 03:05:33,560
Is anyone else sweaty?

2520
03:05:34,580 --> 03:05:34,820
Okay.

2521
03:05:35,940 --> 03:05:40,160
I think they could see me from up here, so I gotta be careful with my outfit.

2522
03:05:45,220 --> 03:05:47,240
Now I select the main character, baby.

2523
03:05:47,400 --> 03:05:48,520
What am I?

2524
03:05:48,540 --> 03:05:49,620
What new item did I get?

2525
03:05:49,800 --> 03:05:50,320
Oh, key B.

2526
03:05:52,420 --> 03:05:55,620
Open the door in the east of the mountain top.

2527
03:05:58,200 --> 03:06:00,360
Do I have my binoculars?

2528
03:06:03,580 --> 03:06:03,840
No.

2529
03:06:04,700 --> 03:06:05,240
Oh, whoops.

2530
03:06:05,540 --> 03:06:06,080
Oh, my God.

2531
03:06:06,160 --> 03:06:07,820
Wait, the croc sticks out.

2532
03:06:08,680 --> 03:06:10,040
This little beehive.

2533
03:06:11,680 --> 03:06:12,960
That's so cute.

2534
03:06:17,520 --> 03:06:18,880
Where's my binoculars?

2535
03:06:24,010 --> 03:06:24,890
I

2536
03:06:28,760 --> 03:06:32,080
wonder if you can see guys from here.

2537
03:06:33,040 --> 03:06:34,200
Oh yes you can!

2538
03:06:38,400 --> 03:06:40,160
Wowie wowie.

2539
03:06:41,380 --> 03:06:43,860
That's where we're gonna go get our crotch grabbed.

2540
03:06:46,960 --> 03:06:48,720
I'm excited.

2541
03:06:49,240 --> 03:06:50,120
Are you excited?

2542
03:06:50,920 --> 03:06:51,400
Yippee!

2543
03:06:57,160 --> 03:06:57,920
guy?

2544
03:07:03,030 --> 03:07:04,310
Literally just one guy?

2545
03:07:06,150 --> 03:07:08,430
Get one guy to Grosdy Grub?

2546
03:07:10,130 --> 03:07:12,010
Where's everybody else?

2547
03:07:18,220 --> 03:07:18,980
Huh.

2548
03:07:19,980 --> 03:07:20,900
I think there's two.

2549
03:07:21,800 --> 03:07:22,480
There are?

2550
03:07:23,460 --> 03:07:25,380
Well he's really well hidden.

2551
03:07:32,690 --> 03:07:34,570
You little booger!

2552
03:07:35,930 --> 03:07:41,990
Major Zero, I'm trying to hide in my cardboard box and the guards keep finding me because of my massive croc booty.

2553
03:07:43,470 --> 03:07:45,450
Wait, where's Gako then?

2554
03:07:51,030 --> 03:07:52,850
Gako, Gako, Gako, Gako.

2555
03:07:57,870 --> 03:08:00,050
Gako, Gako, Gako, Gako.

2556
03:08:04,370 --> 03:08:06,670
Unless he is behind me!

2557
03:08:11,680 --> 03:08:13,980
I'm gonna get out of this area though because it's making me lag.

2558
03:08:24,320 --> 03:08:45,300
nice delicious snack yummy yummy yummy there should be some more under the bed yep nice oh I forgot that I'm basically like out of watch out for that guy um I forgot I'm basically out of ammo what did I just grab

2559
03:08:48,800 --> 03:08:51,480
I don't think I nope nope

2560
03:08:59,750 --> 03:09:01,670
Am I going to be able to fight the Fury?

2561
03:09:04,390 --> 03:09:06,170
Yeah, I got mo's an ammo.

2562
03:09:09,290 --> 03:09:10,490
This is not good.

2563
03:09:12,370 --> 03:09:13,970
This is quite bad.

2564
03:09:15,530 --> 03:09:16,030
Oh, wait.

2565
03:09:16,170 --> 03:09:17,330
I need to, of course, I need to leave.

2566
03:09:19,650 --> 03:09:20,870
You look up, you'll find keratan.

2567
03:09:22,010 --> 03:09:23,650
Oh, no, that's gako.

2568
03:09:24,010 --> 03:09:25,250
Wait, is there keratan in here?

2569
03:09:25,350 --> 03:09:28,990
Oh, wait, because, yeah, this is technically another map, so...

2570
03:09:34,570 --> 03:09:35,010
Wait.

2571
03:09:38,470 --> 03:09:40,270
I can get it.

2572
03:09:46,340 --> 03:09:47,220
Bakero time.

2573
03:09:54,400 --> 03:09:57,220
Time to hold up every guard, you see, for more gotcha.

2574
03:10:00,640 --> 03:10:02,860
I'm nervous, but if I die, I die.

2575
03:10:03,060 --> 03:10:03,340
It's okay.

2576
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:06,100
Let's just go.

2577
03:10:11,360 --> 03:10:12,280
How do I get...

2578
03:10:13,440 --> 03:10:14,320
That was...

2579
03:10:14,320 --> 03:10:17,940
Okay, to get to where I need to go, that's the place I saw before.

2580
03:10:18,460 --> 03:10:18,680
No.

2581
03:10:19,200 --> 03:10:19,740
That's a different...

2582
03:10:22,260 --> 03:10:22,700
Oh.

2583
03:10:24,180 --> 03:10:25,760
I can't remember this area either.

2584
03:10:28,060 --> 03:10:30,500
I'm so bad at remembering sometimes.

2585
03:10:31,640 --> 03:10:33,220
Um, we could hold up everybody.

2586
03:10:33,800 --> 03:10:34,840
We could do that.

2587
03:10:40,450 --> 03:10:41,330
80 camo.

2588
03:10:41,450 --> 03:10:41,910
Let's go.

2589
03:10:43,270 --> 03:10:44,450
85 when not moving.

2590
03:10:44,610 --> 03:10:44,970
Let's go.

2591
03:10:47,690 --> 03:10:50,150
Wait, now they have the flamethrowers, though, right?

2592
03:10:51,570 --> 03:10:52,990
Oh, there's one.

2593
03:10:53,810 --> 03:10:54,030
Yeah.

2594
03:10:55,830 --> 03:10:57,490
Yeah, now they have the flamethrower.

2595
03:11:01,390 --> 03:11:01,930
Nice.

2596
03:11:02,650 --> 03:11:03,550
Nice, nice.

2597
03:11:04,270 --> 03:11:04,650
Yeah.

2598
03:11:05,270 --> 03:11:07,850
I could hold this guy up, maybe.

2599
03:11:08,950 --> 03:11:09,630
Let's try it.

2600
03:11:09,730 --> 03:11:10,230
If I die.

2601
03:11:12,630 --> 03:11:13,830
I die, baby.

2602
03:11:14,270 --> 03:11:15,510
If I die, I die.

2603
03:11:25,320 --> 03:11:26,760
Wiggle for me!

2604
03:11:27,060 --> 03:11:27,980
Wiggle for me!

2605
03:11:28,820 --> 03:11:30,620
Oh, like you just don't care.

2606
03:11:30,880 --> 03:11:34,000
Is the achievement I just got?

2607
03:11:35,260 --> 03:11:35,820
Come on!

2608
03:11:36,120 --> 03:11:36,420
Wiggle!

2609
03:11:36,920 --> 03:11:37,120
Wiggle!

2610
03:11:37,800 --> 03:11:38,160
Wiggle!

2611
03:11:38,680 --> 03:11:39,340
Wiggle.

2612
03:11:40,120 --> 03:11:40,660
Wiggle.

2613
03:11:41,100 --> 03:11:41,990
Dance for me.

2614
03:11:42,460 --> 03:11:42,800
Dance?

2615
03:11:43,160 --> 03:11:43,640
Nothing there.

2616
03:11:43,920 --> 03:11:44,540
Uh, nothing there?

2617
03:11:45,300 --> 03:11:46,040
Nope, nothing here.

2618
03:11:48,780 --> 03:11:49,700
Nothing here.

2619
03:11:50,240 --> 03:11:51,100
Nothing here.

2620
03:11:53,480 --> 03:11:54,740
Yes, you are.

2621
03:11:55,020 --> 03:11:56,680
Ah, that's that right there.

2622
03:11:58,900 --> 03:12:00,360
I think this is where I need to go.

2623
03:12:00,700 --> 03:12:00,800
No?

2624
03:12:06,350 --> 03:12:06,710
There?

2625
03:12:08,290 --> 03:12:08,830
Hold on.

2626
03:12:09,010 --> 03:12:09,530
My eye.

2627
03:12:15,610 --> 03:12:17,730
I might be able to just run for it.

2628
03:12:21,890 --> 03:12:22,990
We're running for it.

2629
03:12:23,810 --> 03:12:25,430
We're doing exactly what I said we would do.

2630
03:12:28,910 --> 03:12:31,150
This is not where I need to go.

2631
03:12:32,190 --> 03:12:33,690
Um, guys, I made a mistake.

2632
03:12:33,950 --> 03:12:34,750
Wait, where am I?

2633
03:12:36,290 --> 03:12:37,570
That's not at all where I need to go.

2634
03:12:38,050 --> 03:12:38,650
I was a liar.

2635
03:12:39,550 --> 03:12:40,570
I can't remember at all.

2636
03:12:42,110 --> 03:12:43,990
Why don't you do your own video on where...

2637
03:12:43,990 --> 03:12:44,570
Oh, there it is.

2638
03:12:44,610 --> 03:12:45,010
There it is.

2639
03:12:45,550 --> 03:12:46,870
I gotta unlock it, though.

2640
03:12:47,850 --> 03:12:49,210
Please don't explode me.

2641
03:12:50,750 --> 03:12:51,210
Oh, okay.

2642
03:12:51,490 --> 03:12:51,850
We're fine.

2643
03:12:53,730 --> 03:12:56,690
I don't think I'm gonna be able to do the Fury, though.

2644
03:12:57,690 --> 03:12:59,330
I'm nervous about this.

2645
03:13:02,710 --> 03:13:03,610
I'm a little nervous.

2646
03:13:04,210 --> 03:13:05,270
Unless they give me some more.

2647
03:13:06,270 --> 03:13:07,130
Right here.

2648
03:13:09,770 --> 03:13:10,010
Okay.

2649
03:13:20,690 --> 03:13:21,190
Here.

2650
03:13:28,690 --> 03:13:30,770
I think the game hates me.

2651
03:13:31,670 --> 03:13:32,110
For real.

2652
03:13:34,110 --> 03:13:35,210
Oh, we haven't tried this one.

2653
03:13:35,550 --> 03:13:35,750
Oh, wait.

2654
03:13:35,810 --> 03:13:36,770
This is the poison one.

2655
03:13:37,150 --> 03:13:37,650
Whatever.

2656

We're good.

2661
03:14:09,510 --> 03:14:10,050
We're good.

2662
03:14:10,290 --> 03:14:10,710
We're good.

2663
03:14:11,450 --> 03:14:14,030
I was gonna say there might be some down there, but we're good.

2664
03:14:14,710 --> 03:14:14,990
We're good.

2665
03:14:16,770 --> 03:14:17,670
Whoa, it's cool.

2666
03:14:17,810 --> 03:14:19,490
You can, like, actually see down there.

2667
03:14:20,230 --> 03:14:20,890
That's fine.

2668
03:14:21,670 --> 03:14:22,110
Okay!

2669
03:14:26,170 --> 03:14:27,430
Uh, we should be fine.

2670
03:14:28,390 --> 03:14:33,730
Wait, I wish I could remember how to reload, though.

2671
03:14:36,130 --> 03:14:36,570
Cool.

2672
03:14:37,790 --> 03:14:38,390
I remember.

2673
03:14:39,930 --> 03:14:41,310
Did I miss the ladder scene?

2674
03:14:41,670 --> 03:14:42,570
Yeah, unfortunately.

2675
03:14:44,630 --> 03:14:45,310
Oh, night vision.

2676
03:14:45,610 --> 03:14:46,330
Yeah, let me put those on.

2677
03:14:47,010 --> 03:14:47,650
Thank you.

2678
03:14:48,510 --> 03:14:49,770
Yeah, we'll put those in.

2679
03:14:50,510 --> 03:14:51,170
We'll put those in.

2680
03:14:54,070 --> 03:14:58,250
I have a feeling this fight...

2681
03:14:58,250 --> 03:15:02,790
You know how, like, with twin snakes, Vulcan Raven is very much easier.

2682
03:15:05,150 --> 03:15:07,510
I have a feeling this will be the same.

2683
03:15:09,250 --> 03:15:15,430
especially with the peace walker outfit i think it's gonna be not so bad

2684
03:15:19,190 --> 03:15:23,510
alternate cutscene pov with really wait so if i equip them

2685
03:15:29,290 --> 03:15:39,950

Wait, we look awesome!

2689
03:15:50,890 --> 03:15:52,410
Sam Fisher, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2690
03:15:54,650 --> 03:15:56,030
Sam, wishing I was fishing.

2691
03:15:58,510 --> 03:15:59,610
Looks sick actually.

2692
03:15:59,850 --> 03:16:00,310
I know!

2693
03:16:00,690 --> 03:16:01,030
Wow!

2694
03:16:03,870 --> 03:16:06,090
It's cool to see it from this perspective.

2695
03:16:08,530 --> 03:16:11,430
Like, because of course when you put it on, you always like, just...

2696
03:16:13,250 --> 03:16:14,930
See it from further away.

2697
03:16:25,450 --> 03:16:30,790
I love the furries I love I love

And do you know what I saw there?

2700
03:17:01,020 --> 03:17:01,400
Right!

2701
03:17:06,100 --> 03:17:06,800

2702
03:17:08,060 --> 03:17:08,680

So cool!

2705
03:17:21,700 --> 03:17:25,080
Now, you're going to feel the scorching heat of that horrible planet.

2706
03:17:25,160 --> 03:17:26,360
I can't see anything.

2707
03:17:34,570 --> 03:17:35,250
Here we go.

2708
03:17:49,290 --> 03:17:50,030
Was that him?

2709
03:17:57,870 --> 03:17:59,370
Oh my gosh, no way.

2710
03:18:09,040 --> 03:18:10,340
Oh, he really didn't.

2711
03:18:14,980 --> 03:18:16,880
Oh, I gotta rip his suit first, though.

2712
03:18:20,480 --> 03:18:21,180
No, I don't.

2713
03:18:21,280 --> 03:18:21,600
Just kidding.

2714
03:18:22,680 --> 03:18:23,360
I know how he goes.

2715
03:18:23,480 --> 03:18:24,000

2718
03:19:06,800 --> 03:19:08,000
Holy cow.

2719
03:19:08,260 --> 03:19:11,100
Oh, that was close.

2720
03:19:12,680 --> 03:19:13,460
Snake, please move.

2721
03:19:14,940 --> 03:19:17,360
I'm in, like, the worst possible spot here.

2722
03:19:17,760 --> 03:19:18,360
Oh, my gosh.

2723
03:19:18,620 --> 03:19:19,480
Oh, my gosh.

2724
03:19:19,820 --> 03:19:20,060
Okay.

2725
03:19:20,360 --> 03:19:20,900
Thank you.

2726
03:19:21,160 --> 03:19:22,020
Oh, my goodness.

2727
03:19:25,560 --> 03:19:26,340
Cheers, Snake.

2728
03:19:26,460 --> 03:19:27,540
What the heck were you doing?

2729
03:19:30,760 --> 03:19:32,700
Hang on, BBQ.

2730
03:19:33,340 --> 03:19:33,940
Thank you.

2731
03:19:42,710 --> 03:19:44,430
I don't think you need night vision yet.

2732
03:19:44,670 --> 03:19:45,710
Well, I guess for the cutscene.

2733
03:19:46,230 --> 03:19:48,090
But I don't think you need it for the fight itself.

2734
03:19:49,030 --> 03:19:50,470
Well, I did up my brightness.

2735
03:19:50,730 --> 03:19:51,850
I'll say that.

2736
03:19:52,250 --> 03:20:00,290
I did up my brightness for the stream.

2737
03:20:27,960 --> 03:20:29,020
That was pretty bad.

2738
03:20:29,380 --> 03:20:30,140
That was pretty bad.

2739
03:20:31,680 --> 03:20:32,420
That was pretty bad.

2740
03:20:32,900 --> 03:20:34,720
That was pretty terrible.

2741
03:20:35,280 --> 03:20:36,080
That was pretty bad.

2742
03:20:36,080 --> 03:20:37,160
That was pretty bad.

2743
03:20:41,700 --> 03:20:43,980
Um, let's eat...

2744
03:20:44,920 --> 03:20:45,980
I'll get...

2745
03:20:47,420 --> 03:20:49,000
Let's just eat the noodles.

2746
03:20:50,680 --> 03:20:52,600
Equipping a box still puts out the flame?

2747
03:20:53,260 --> 03:20:54,080
It does!

2748
03:20:55,260 --> 03:20:55,760
Wait.

2749
03:20:56,800 --> 03:20:59,980
Well, I'm already, like, injured, so it doesn't really...

2750
03:21:00,540 --> 03:21:02,240
It's... we're just low health.

2751
03:21:06,200 --> 03:21:07,520
Holy moly.

2752
03:21:08,380 --> 03:21:09,280
I just gotta recover.

2753
03:21:14,500 --> 03:21:15,820
Recover, snake, recover!

2754
03:21:16,880 --> 03:21:17,820
Recover, snake, recover!

2755
03:21:20,100 --> 03:21:22,460
I'm kind of in a really bad spot.

2756
03:21:24,040 --> 03:21:25,480
I need to do...

2757
03:21:28,540 --> 03:21:29,020
That

2758
03:21:33,940 --> 03:21:34,960
is what I need to do.

2759
03:21:43,100 --> 03:21:45,980
I'm not recovering very fast, but...

2760
03:21:47,200 --> 03:21:47,920
That's okay.

2761
03:21:51,880 --> 03:21:54,960
I could... Oh, yeah, actually, I do have some life meta.

2762
03:21:54,980 --> 03:21:58,100
Listen, do you guys think I should take it?

2763
03:21:58,900 --> 03:21:59,880
I'm scared of dying.

2764
03:22:01,720 --> 03:22:03,440
I haven't used it at all.

2765
03:22:13,610 --> 03:22:15,030
Just gonna keep crawling for now.

2766
03:22:15,850 --> 03:22:16,310
What's this?

2767
03:22:16,890 --> 03:22:17,810
I can't- Oh, damn it.

2768
03:22:17,910 --> 03:22:18,730
Nice, nice, nice.

2769
03:22:19,970 --> 03:22:20,570
Good stuff.

2770
03:22:21,930 --> 03:22:23,270
My anger is growing.

2771
03:22:24,370 --> 03:22:25,610
It's- it's- yes.

2772
03:22:27,270 --> 03:22:28,530
Wait, did I see him?

2773
03:22:40,250 --> 03:22:41,990
I don't know which direction he's coming from.

2774
03:22:43,350 --> 03:22:44,250
Oh, there he is.

2775
03:22:54,480 --> 03:22:56,160
I don't know if that hit him, actually.

2776
03:22:57,780 --> 03:22:58,680
I don't know.

2777
03:23:07,100 --> 03:23:07,280
Bats.

2778
03:23:08,420 --> 03:23:09,040
Freaking bats.

2779
03:23:09,780 --> 03:23:11,040
No, no, no, stay away.

2780
03:23:11,780 --> 03:23:12,480
Freaking bats.

2781
03:23:14,400 --> 03:23:15,120
There he is.

2782
03:23:17,760 --> 03:23:18,160
Bats.

2783
03:23:41,250 --> 03:23:42,110
It won't let me.

2784
03:23:43,370 --> 03:23:44,610
Look at the box!

2785
03:23:50,040 --> 03:23:51,160
I think I hear him right.

2786
03:23:51,180 --> 03:23:52,460
He's right behind me.

2787
03:23:58,900 --> 03:24:00,260
He's right behind me, isn't he?

2788
03:24:02,640 --> 03:24:03,980
Please not again.

2789
03:24:07,840 --> 03:24:08,940
Okay, okay, again.

2790
03:24:09,360 --> 03:24:09,840
We're fine.

2791
03:24:11,560 --> 03:24:14,180
Let me... I'm gonna eat some more food.

2792
03:24:16,200 --> 03:24:16,740
Whatever.

2793
03:24:17,300 --> 03:24:18,340
It's tiny, but...

2794
03:24:18,960 --> 03:24:20,660
This is so horrible.

2795
03:24:21,200 --> 03:24:22,940
Oh wait, actually that did a lot.

2796
03:24:53,720 --> 03:24:54,920
No pipes here?

2797
03:24:57,400 --> 03:24:58,300
Oh, hi, Kurodan.

2798
03:25:03,860 --> 03:25:05,540
He stresses me out when he does that.

2799
03:25:08,820 --> 03:25:09,300
Okay.

2800
03:25:09,380 --> 03:25:11,720
I think he's right there.

2801
03:25:35,180 --> 03:25:36,520
We'll put out some of these flames.

2802
03:25:46,340 --> 03:25:47,520
Where's he getting?

2803
03:25:49,840 --> 03:25:50,980
What's there?

2804
03:25:55,280 --> 03:25:56,140
Did he see me?

2805
03:25:56,760 --> 03:25:57,180
Oh shoot.

2806
03:26:08,070 --> 03:26:08,550
We running?

2807
03:26:12,210 --> 03:26:14,850
Gosh, this fight is still scary.

2808
03:26:17,150 --> 03:26:18,550
This fight is still scary.

2809
03:26:23,310 --> 03:26:25,470
The spider is still very scary.

2810
03:26:26,670 --> 03:26:28,170
I don't like it.

2811
03:26:28,410 --> 03:26:28,990
Booy!

2812
03:26:37,900 --> 03:26:38,940
Holy cow.

2813
03:26:44,160 --> 03:26:44,740
We're

2814
03:27:04,540 --> 03:27:05,700
like almost half.

2815
03:27:16,020 --> 03:27:16,860
Is he coming here?

2816
03:27:22,480 --> 03:27:24,160
I don't want to just stand out in the open.

2817
03:27:31,940 --> 03:27:32,420
Oh, shoot.

2818
03:27:45,120 --> 03:27:45,800
Dang it.

2819
03:27:45,860 --> 03:27:46,580
He's gone.

2820
03:27:47,420 --> 03:27:48,840
Oh my gosh, there's so much fire here.

2821
03:27:49,020 --> 03:27:50,450
Like, I don't feel like I can go that way.

2822
03:28:12,260 --> 03:28:13,600
All blocked off.

2823
03:28:13,740 --> 03:28:14,880
I know it's pretty tough.

2824
03:28:25,360 --> 03:28:25,660
Please.

2825
03:28:26,160 --> 03:28:26,580
I'm cooking.

2826
03:28:27,480 --> 03:28:27,800
I'm cooking.

2827
03:28:28,460 --> 03:28:29,540
Oh, I'm not on fire.

2828
03:28:30,780 --> 03:28:31,180
Fine.

2829
03:28:32,300 --> 03:28:33,300
Where are you?

2830
03:28:33,660 --> 03:28:34,380
I'm lost.

2831
03:28:34,640 --> 03:28:35,020
I lost.

2832
03:28:38,850 --> 03:28:39,570
Oh my gosh.

2833
03:28:39,690 --> 03:28:40,650
Oh my gosh.

2834
03:28:59,680 --> 03:29:00,820
Wait, where'd he go?

2835
03:29:01,080 --> 03:29:01,590
Oh, there he is.

2836
03:29:03,400 --> 03:29:05,200
No, no!

2837
03:29:07,560 --> 03:29:08,440
Did I get him?

2838
03:29:11,400 --> 03:29:11,860
Yeah!

2839
03:29:12,700 --> 03:29:13,920
Wait, did I get him?

2840
03:29:21,790 --> 03:29:22,530
Is this the cheese?

2841
03:29:27,810 --> 03:29:28,270
Reload?

2842
03:29:28,770 --> 03:29:29,230
Reload?

2843
03:29:37,830 --> 03:29:38,590
No, no, no, no, no.

2844
03:29:38,750 --> 03:29:39,410
Where are you coming from?

2845
03:29:43,230 --> 03:29:44,250
Oh gosh, okay.

2846
03:29:48,370 --> 03:29:49,230
I'm stressed.

2847
03:29:50,690 --> 03:29:51,950
I'm stressed, I'm stressed.

2848
03:29:54,070 --> 03:29:56,870
That was close, that was close, that was close.

2849
03:29:57,010 --> 03:30:00,470
That was close, that was close, that was close.

2850
03:30:00,850 --> 03:30:01,810
Oh gosh!

2851
03:30:02,870 --> 03:30:04,590
No, please, please.

2852
03:30:05,870 --> 03:30:06,510
Ah!

2853
03:30:07,010 --> 03:30:07,270
No!

2854
03:30:25,300 --> 03:30:26,500
I'm so sweaty.

2855
03:30:27,380 --> 03:30:29,520
My hands are so sweaty right now.

2856
03:30:42,590 --> 03:30:43,930
That's not a lot.

2857
03:30:50,320 --> 03:30:51,380
Snake, get up, please.

2858
03:30:55,280 --> 03:30:57,240
Please put on the box.

2859
03:30:57,820 --> 03:30:58,480
Okay, cure.

2860
03:30:59,220 --> 03:31:00,340
Holy cow.

2861
03:31:02,800 --> 03:31:03,160
What?

2862
03:31:04,120 --> 03:31:05,060
Oh, wait a minute.

2863
03:31:05,680 --> 03:31:06,280
Bandage.

2864
03:31:09,240 --> 03:31:12,660
MGS4 Rose would be calling about stress right now for real.

2865
03:31:14,360 --> 03:31:16,180
I'm so sweaty!

2866
03:31:18,920 --> 03:31:19,920
Holy cow!

2867
03:31:20,080 --> 03:31:22,380
Oh my gosh, my health is like the lowest it could be.

2868
03:31:23,120 --> 03:31:25,060
I'm just gonna be eating all my food, I think.

2869
03:31:26,640 --> 03:31:29,020
I wish I could recover faster!

2870
03:31:30,600 --> 03:31:32,860
Yeah, I want the final meal snake.

2871
03:31:33,140 --> 03:31:34,360
It's calorie made.

2872
03:31:41,080 --> 03:31:43,220
You might even have to eat the parrot!

2873
03:31:49,300 --> 03:31:49,820
Okay.

2874
03:31:51,760 --> 03:31:53,920
He's not even close either, which is...

2875
03:31:53,920 --> 03:31:55,020
Which really sucks.

2876
03:31:57,940 --> 03:31:58,880
Oh, gosh.

2877
03:31:59,540 --> 03:32:00,620
I'm so low.

2878
03:32:04,580 --> 03:32:05,360
Don't get hit.

2879
03:32:12,570 --> 03:32:14,170
I'm, like, really in a bad spot.

2880
03:32:14,850 --> 03:32:16,430
I'm really, really in a bad spot.

2881
03:32:35,780 --> 03:32:36,520
That's it.

2882
03:32:36,620 --> 03:32:37,080
That's it.

2883
03:32:37,320 --> 03:32:37,660
That's it.

2884
03:32:38,080 --> 03:32:38,740
That's it.

2885
03:32:38,960 --> 03:32:39,800
That's it.

2886
03:32:39,800 --> 03:32:40,720
Uh...

2887
03:32:47,740 --> 03:32:49,400
Let's fool it around, Snake.

2888
03:32:50,440 --> 03:32:51,080
Snake?

2889
03:32:52,340 --> 03:32:52,980
Snake!

2890
03:32:53,700 --> 03:32:56,440
Fooling around, he says.

2891
03:33:00,060 --> 03:33:01,460
Oh my god!

2892
03:33:01,780 --> 03:33:02,860
Oh, we're right into it!

2893
03:33:07,380 --> 03:33:08,020
Okay.

2894
03:33:08,980 --> 03:33:10,960
I thought it would be before the cutscene.

2895
03:33:12,700 --> 03:33:14,480
My mistake for...

2896
03:33:15,520 --> 03:33:16,740
Thinking I would have a moment.

2897
03:33:17,880 --> 03:33:19,780
Wait, that didn't do anything!

2898
03:33:20,180 --> 03:33:21,820
They didn't feel that at all!

2899
03:33:33,950 --> 03:33:35,290
Don't walk into the fire, Snake.

2900
03:33:40,410 --> 03:33:41,370
Wait, where'd he go?

2901
03:33:44,530 --> 03:33:45,190
Oh, there he is.

2902
03:33:51,780 --> 03:33:53,780
Oh my god, I thought he was...

2903
03:33:53,780 --> 03:33:55,740
I meant to switch back.

2904
03:34:00,980 --> 03:34:02,060
What the hell was that?

2905
03:34:02,400 --> 03:34:03,260
What was that noise?

2906
03:34:04,500 --> 03:34:05,680
I have an edge on my nose.

2907
03:34:09,660 --> 03:34:10,300
Yes?

2908
03:34:12,100 --> 03:34:12,740
Yes?

2909
03:34:14,420 --> 03:34:16,120
You're stressing me out, man.

2910
03:34:16,320 --> 03:34:17,440
You're stressing me out.

2911
03:34:26,660 --> 03:34:27,300
Magnus!

2912
03:34:27,800 --> 03:34:29,240
You're stressing me out!

2913
03:34:30,080 --> 03:34:32,740
I think

2914
03:34:50,140 --> 03:34:51,360
he's gonna come down here.

2915
03:34:54,340 --> 03:34:56,020
Having trouble seeing you.

2916
03:34:57,440 --> 03:34:59,240
No, not at all, actually.

2917
03:35:00,420 --> 03:35:00,920
What about you?

2918
03:35:01,880 --> 03:35:03,420
Seems like you are, old man.

2919
03:35:08,760 --> 03:35:12,020
I'm literally the pain of my existence, this stinking guy.

2920
03:35:15,980 --> 03:35:16,620
Oh, was there a stutter?

2921
03:35:16,980 --> 03:35:17,220
Sorry.

2922
03:35:43,300 --> 03:35:43,820
What's here?

2923
03:35:44,420 --> 03:35:44,600
Oh.

2924
03:35:45,420 --> 03:35:46,700
I wish I could do this legally.

2925
03:35:47,280 --> 03:35:47,620
Oh.

2926
03:36:10,500 --> 03:36:11,200
Oh my gosh.

2927
03:36:11,580 --> 03:36:11,720
Wait.

2928
03:36:11,960 --> 03:36:12,580
No, no, no!

2929
03:36:42,290 --> 03:36:43,370
Where the heck is he?

2930
03:36:47,460 --> 03:36:48,640
I missed him?

2931
03:36:48,860 --> 03:36:49,180
I think.

2932
03:36:50,380 --> 03:36:52,020
Actually don't know where he went at all.

2933
03:37:00,900 --> 03:37:01,700
Oh, I did get it.

2934
03:37:01,780 --> 03:37:02,120
Okay, good.

2935
03:37:03,740 --> 03:37:06,260
Oh, was he above me?

2936
03:37:06,400 --> 03:37:06,720
My bad.

2937
03:37:15,240 --> 03:37:16,000
I heard him.

2938
03:37:16,100 --> 03:37:17,140
It sounded like he was so close.

2939
03:37:53,480 --> 03:38:01,260

2945
03:39:37,900 --> 03:39:39,740
20 years later, Fury is still the same.

2946
03:39:39,860 --> 03:39:41,600
I know, my God.

2947
03:40:09,760 --> 03:40:10,440
Oh, my gosh.

2948
03:40:10,600 --> 03:40:11,020
Wait, he's coming.

2949
03:40:22,280 --> 03:40:23,660
Where is he, though?

2950
03:40:24,320 --> 03:40:24,800
Oh, my gosh.

2951
03:40:24,960 --> 03:40:25,520
I don't know.

2952
03:40:25,640 --> 03:40:26,180
Where am I?

2953
03:40:53,820 --> 03:40:54,700
Ah, shit.

2954
03:40:56,440 --> 03:40:57,680
No, please, take it up.

2955
03:41:02,200 --> 03:41:10,280
fire anymore so I don't think I got him that time which kind of sucks oh

2956
03:41:35,840 --> 03:41:47,060
I'm not doing enough damage nice dodge thank you I'm not doing enough damage which really over here you don't know where I am do you

2957
03:42:05,710 --> 03:42:09,850
oh it is my anger is growing

2958
03:42:13,490 --> 03:42:17,910
I thought he was right behind me he's right in front of me

2959
03:42:26,740 --> 03:42:27,540
Go, please!

2960
03:42:34,100 --> 03:42:35,980
Dang it, I didn't get him at all.

2961
03:42:37,120 --> 03:42:37,620
I tried.

2962
03:42:38,320 --> 03:42:40,340
I tried to sneak up on him.

2963
03:42:44,200 --> 03:42:45,520
This guy is so hard.

2964
03:42:50,560 --> 03:42:53,560
The indicator for, like, the water pipes is really good, though.

2965
03:42:53,640 --> 03:42:54,540
Like, the bright red.

2966
03:42:58,020 --> 03:43:01,560
It's really good, especially if you've never played the game before and don't know that you can do that.

2967
03:43:07,740 --> 03:43:09,160
I wish this would go out.

2968
03:43:09,380 --> 03:43:10,400
I'm kind of trapped.

2969
03:43:29,930 --> 03:43:31,770
I need to get some good hits on him.

2970
03:43:31,990 --> 03:43:32,490
For real.

2971
03:43:36,890 --> 03:43:38,230
Shoot pipes for water.

2972
03:43:50,400 --> 03:43:52,360
I don't think it hit him.

2973
03:43:56,620 --> 03:43:57,660
So frustrating.

2974
03:43:58,240 --> 03:43:59,120
Oh my gosh.

2975
03:44:05,460 --> 03:44:06,860
Shoot the pipes for water.

2976
03:44:11,320 --> 03:44:12,800
Me 20 seconds ago.

2977
03:44:13,100 --> 03:44:17,120
Wow, it's really nice that the pipes grow red so that you can shoot them for water.

2978
03:44:37,340 --> 03:44:38,660
I'm going to use a cure.

2979
03:44:39,080 --> 03:44:40,580
I'm going to use a live cure.

2980
03:44:40,920 --> 03:44:41,260
I don't care.

2981
03:44:43,420 --> 03:44:44,680
I'm going to use a live medicine.

2982
03:44:45,840 --> 03:44:48,440
I only use them for boss battles and we have...

2983
03:44:50,440 --> 03:45:00,800
have a handful left now that I think about it oh wow we do actually have a handful of them left

2984
03:45:27,660 --> 03:45:31,800
stupid ass my dumb ass

2985
03:45:36,140 --> 03:45:37,660
please let me hit you

2986
03:45:42,140 --> 03:46:08,050
please this guy really does have the this guy really does make my rage consume me this spot, but it's also scary.

2987
03:46:09,310 --> 03:46:11,490
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

2988
03:46:39,600 --> 03:46:39,720
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2989
03:46:39,840 --> 03:46:41,620
This fight is hurting my throat.

2990
03:46:41,880 --> 03:46:43,080
Hold on, I'm taking a cough drop.

2991
03:47:08,420 --> 03:47:10,280
It's so hard to see him, too.

2992
03:47:15,000 --> 03:47:15,360
A

2993
03:47:24,790 --> 03:47:25,790
couple of good hits.

2994
03:47:26,030 --> 03:47:26,870
I like this area.

2995
03:47:29,350 --> 03:47:30,250
It's out in the open.

2996
03:47:30,410 --> 03:47:30,770
It's scary.

2997
03:47:36,710 --> 03:47:39,190
but you can get some good hits on him

2998
03:47:45,190 --> 03:47:46,230
you know

2999
03:47:52,010 --> 03:47:53,750
please stay excited get up

3000
03:48:05,580 --> 03:48:11,780
um he's like so aggro right now he's like crazy aggro right now

3001
03:48:16,120 --> 03:48:23,420
that's damn good that's damn good show him the emotion you carry into battle unleash the freak

3002
03:48:45,250 --> 03:48:47,030
I don't think that hit him.

3003
03:48:47,350 --> 03:48:48,650
That's so messed up.

3004
03:48:48,770 --> 03:48:50,190
Wait, I don't think that got him at all.

3005
03:48:50,610 --> 03:48:52,150
That's actually so messed up.

3006
03:48:53,030 --> 03:48:54,890
That's actually so messed up.

3007
03:48:56,810 --> 03:48:57,530
Did it?

3008
03:48:57,910 --> 03:48:58,430
It did?

3009
03:48:58,670 --> 03:49:00,350
It did hit just a tiny bit.

3010
03:49:00,550 --> 03:49:02,390
It looks like his bar didn't go down at all.

3011
03:49:03,010 --> 03:49:04,610
I'm gonna have to take another life mode.

3012
03:49:06,270 --> 03:49:07,190
I'm gonna have to.

3013
03:49:13,900 --> 03:49:15,260
We're running in circles.

3014
03:49:18,260 --> 03:49:19,400
Holy shit.

3015
03:49:20,300 --> 03:49:20,760
Holy shit.

3016
03:49:23,060 --> 03:49:23,660
Please.

3017
03:49:39,330 --> 03:49:40,010
First try.

3018
03:49:42,110 --> 03:49:44,190
This is the end of the coax.

3019
03:49:45,310 --> 03:49:46,570
You've got to live on.

3020
03:49:47,550 --> 03:49:49,050
You're the only one left.

3021
03:49:49,910 --> 03:49:50,830
I'm off.

3022
03:49:51,770 --> 03:49:52,810
I took the chance.

3023
03:49:53,090 --> 03:49:53,490
Join the shot.

3024
03:49:53,490 --> 03:49:53,810
I took the chance.

3025
03:49:53,830 --> 03:49:55,130
chance baby

3026
03:50:09,370 --> 03:50:21,190
behold the flames of fury the fires of hell will purge me clean see you there I

3027
03:50:27,070 --> 03:50:34,130
can see it mission control do you read me I

3028
03:50:51,360 --> 03:50:52,380
See the earth?

3029
03:50:57,160 --> 03:50:58,700
Snake run!

3030
03:51:42,560 --> 03:51:44,200
So awesome.

3031
03:51:45,840 --> 03:51:47,680
Ooh, it's smoky.

3032
03:51:54,980 --> 03:51:56,180
Oh, it's a rat.

3033
03:51:57,420 --> 03:51:58,380
Oh, here.

3034
03:51:59,040 --> 03:51:59,700
Ointment.

3035
03:52:01,160 --> 03:52:03,540
We were on fire!

3036
03:52:04,260 --> 03:52:05,480
Thank you.

3037
03:52:05,500 --> 03:52:06,160
Thank you!

3038
03:52:06,220 --> 03:52:07,060
Thank you!

3039
03:52:07,220 --> 03:52:10,900
We have one life med left, but...

3040
03:52:10,900 --> 03:52:16,920
Fury is a tough guy, so I think we'll be okay for the future stuff.

3041
03:52:17,680 --> 03:52:17,980
Maybe.

3042
03:52:19,860 --> 03:52:20,380
Maybe.

3043
03:52:22,240 --> 03:52:24,660
I'm still a little bit laggy, I apologize.

3044
03:52:29,290 --> 03:52:30,830
I almost went without his camo!

3045
03:52:31,150 --> 03:52:32,170
Oh my gosh!

3046
03:52:32,870 --> 03:52:34,290
I almost went without it!

3047
03:52:35,370 --> 03:52:37,030
It's like, what was all that for?

3048
03:52:37,790 --> 03:52:41,310
Reduces damage from flames and explosions by half.

3049
03:52:42,850 --> 03:52:44,370
It looks good.

3050
03:52:44,630 --> 03:52:45,350
Oh my gosh.

3051
03:52:46,910 --> 03:52:48,670
But I don't think red is snake's color.

3052
03:52:50,490 --> 03:52:52,150
I definitely think like a...

3053
03:52:54,010 --> 03:52:57,270
Like a blue is his color.

3054
03:52:58,370 --> 03:52:58,670
I think.

3055
03:52:59,330 --> 03:53:01,070
And I thought my pain was bad.

3056
03:53:13,190 --> 03:53:13,970
Why are you?

3057
03:53:14,830 --> 03:53:16,830
Did I get him?

3058
03:53:17,010 --> 03:53:17,110
No?

3059
03:53:17,670 --> 03:53:18,030
Where'd he go?

3060
03:53:20,210 --> 03:53:21,070
Where'd the rat go?

3061
03:53:22,670 --> 03:53:23,910
Is that him all the way there?

3062
03:53:24,130 --> 03:53:25,150
Oh no, he's right here.

3063
03:53:25,550 --> 03:53:26,550
Come here, little rat.

3064
03:53:37,290 --> 03:53:37,870
Where'd he go?

3065
03:53:40,650 --> 03:53:42,950
It's like my favorite thing to do is just...

3066
03:53:46,060 --> 03:53:47,440
The animals.

3067
03:53:50,160 --> 03:53:51,680
Because he's so aggressive about it.

3068
03:53:51,880 --> 03:53:52,900
He's so serious.

3069
03:53:53,080 --> 03:53:53,740
Oh, there it is.

3070
03:53:57,670 --> 03:53:58,030
Ah!

3071
03:53:59,830 --> 03:54:01,970
We finally got him.

3072
03:54:02,870 --> 03:54:02,910
Ooh.

3073
03:54:03,650 --> 03:54:04,450
They all right, computer?

3074
03:54:05,930 --> 03:54:06,370
Uh-oh.

3075
03:54:07,210 --> 03:54:09,330
Computer is like...

3076
03:54:09,330 --> 03:54:16,730
Unity plus VTube Studio plus V-Bridgeer, plus streaming...

3077
03:54:16,730 --> 03:54:17,090
Ugh!

3078
03:54:17,270 --> 03:54:17,670
Ugh!

3079
03:54:24,900 --> 03:54:27,580
Come here.

3080
03:54:29,360 --> 03:54:30,690
Okay, I give up.

3081
03:54:32,860 --> 03:54:35,300
Did you turn off wallpaper?

3082
03:54:39,040 --> 03:54:40,380
Would

3083
03:54:47,220 --> 03:54:49,520
you look at that?

3084
03:55:04,330 --> 03:55:06,230
The frames, they're back!

3085
03:55:13,580 --> 03:55:14,250
Yeah!

3086
03:55:21,270 --> 03:55:21,940
Thanks.

3087
03:55:31,240 --> 03:55:37,560
I don't want to know what my computer is looking like right now.

3088
03:55:40,280 --> 03:55:40,700
Nice.

3089
03:55:47,280 --> 03:55:49,420
Guys, we made it to Grozny Grad.

3090
03:55:52,860 --> 03:55:54,640
We made it.

3091
03:55:55,800 --> 03:55:56,480
Where Croc?

3092
03:55:56,820 --> 03:55:57,700
Hold your horses.

3093
03:55:59,260 --> 03:56:00,740
Croc is coming.

3094
03:56:01,060 --> 03:56:03,000
I do love the Peace Walker suit.

3095
03:56:03,480 --> 03:56:04,840
It just looks so good.

3096
03:56:07,200 --> 03:56:10,520
I love it more than the sneaking suit in this game.

3097
03:56:26,210 --> 03:56:27,910
Guess it was something random and unavoidable.

3098
03:56:36,700 --> 03:56:38,540
Peace Walker looks awesome.

3099
03:56:40,380 --> 03:56:40,800
Yeah.

3100
03:56:44,460 --> 03:56:48,380
There is no such thing as Peace Walker slander in this household.

3101
03:56:50,560 --> 03:56:52,640
Can I be a croc?

3102
03:56:59,200 --> 03:56:59,300
Wait.

3103
03:56:59,640 --> 03:57:00,280
Oh, I forgot to click.

3104
03:57:06,460 --> 03:57:08,200
The answer is always yes.

3105
03:57:17,490 --> 03:57:18,270
Game hates me.

3106
03:57:18,310 --> 03:57:18,950
What else is new?

3107
03:57:36,630 --> 03:57:38,230
of you.

3108
03:57:45,520 --> 03:57:47,300
I don't know if I'll walk over here.

3109
03:57:51,460 --> 03:57:52,160
Who's that?

3110
03:57:53,120 --> 03:57:53,520
Radio.

3111
03:57:53,820 --> 03:57:54,480
Where's our backup?

3112
03:57:54,700 --> 03:57:56,700
I'm a crocodile!

3113
03:58:01,560 --> 03:58:02,760
HQ respond.

3114
03:58:05,300 --> 03:58:06,900
Patrol here.

3115
03:58:07,780 --> 03:58:08,620
Enemy sighted.

3116
03:58:08,800 --> 03:58:09,680
Requesting backup.

3117
03:58:11,000 --> 03:58:11,800
Bam.

3118
03:58:12,400 --> 03:58:13,900
They didn't see me go under here.

3119
03:58:18,860 --> 03:58:19,200
Maybe they did.

3120
03:58:20,000 --> 03:58:20,140
We

3121
03:58:24,100 --> 03:58:25,720
made grave mistakes.

3122
03:58:34,640 --> 03:58:36,660
Oops, I looked right at it.

3123
03:58:38,740 --> 03:58:39,300
My bad.

3124
03:58:41,340 --> 03:58:42,200
So sorry, everyone.

3125
03:58:43,980 --> 03:58:47,140
There's like something kind of magical about just looking at you, don't know?

3126
03:58:51,380 --> 03:58:52,800
It works on one...

3127
03:58:52,800 --> 03:58:53,400
Oh, no way.

3128
03:58:54,500 --> 03:58:56,360
It went on one guy.

3129
03:59:02,000 --> 03:59:03,920
Guys, I think I might need to restart this area.

3130
03:59:19,780 --> 03:59:21,160
Oh, I thought I was really...

3131
03:59:21,160 --> 03:59:21,820
Wait, here we go.

3132
03:59:22,160 --> 03:59:24,300
It's, like, so close in between the legs.

3133
03:59:28,110 --> 03:59:28,830
So close.

3134
03:59:30,830 --> 03:59:31,850
Chomp, chomp, chomp.

3135
03:59:40,960 --> 03:59:42,540
Oh, wait, this looks great!

3136
03:59:42,700 --> 03:59:43,580
You can see everything!

3137
03:59:44,140 --> 03:59:44,620
Chomp, chomp!

3138
03:59:52,250 --> 03:59:54,150
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3139
03:59:56,330 --> 03:59:57,150
There we go.

3140
03:59:57,790 --> 04:00:00,570
Okay, back to our regularly scheduled programming.

3141
04:00:02,310 --> 04:00:03,670
I'm gonna redo this area.

3142
04:00:05,230 --> 04:00:05,670
I'm gonna

3143
04:00:08,960 --> 04:00:10,460
and redo it.

3144
04:00:12,060 --> 04:00:13,520
Wait, they really don't know where I went?

3145
04:00:16,380 --> 04:00:18,340
Wait, I don't think they know where I went.

3146
04:00:19,040 --> 04:00:19,200
Wait.

3147
04:00:41,270 --> 04:00:42,830
What do I need to cure from?

3148
04:00:43,210 --> 04:00:43,810
Oh, burns?

3149
04:00:44,450 --> 04:00:45,550
When did I get burned?

3150
04:00:48,990 --> 04:00:49,270
There we go.

3151
04:00:49,470 --> 04:00:50,170
Thanks for the fine gifted.

3152
04:00:50,330 --> 04:00:51,490
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

3153
04:00:51,890 --> 04:00:52,670
Oh, did someone raid?

3154
04:00:52,850 --> 04:00:53,070
Hello!

3155
04:00:53,350 --> 04:00:54,130
I'm so sorry!

3156
04:00:55,070 --> 04:00:55,770
Hello, hello!

3157
04:00:58,550 --> 04:00:59,530
Where did that come from?

3158
04:01:03,610 --> 04:01:05,030
I don't know, man.

3159
04:01:06,190 --> 04:01:07,930
Oh, really bad bug bite.

3160
04:01:13,290 --> 04:01:14,770
Really bad bug bite.

3161
04:01:17,470 --> 04:01:17,930
Ooh, so...

3162
04:01:17,950 --> 04:01:32,780
biting our ankles i might have made it out of this this is hq how is that possible control here we've lost sight of the intruder going into high alert

3163
04:01:36,480 --> 04:01:46,520
wait why are they both like exclamation point the back guy over there i'm just a crocodile with a knife

3164
04:01:52,410 --> 04:01:53,530
i can make it

3165
04:01:57,290 --> 04:01:58,250
Nice, more...

3166
04:02:01,910 --> 04:02:02,730
What do you mean?

3167
04:02:02,870 --> 04:02:03,650
What's wrong?

3168
04:02:07,130 --> 04:02:08,750
Okay, where are we going again?

3169
04:02:10,290 --> 04:02:15,510
Right, we need to go inside, and then we disguise ourselves as the scientist, and we go find...

3170
04:02:17,070 --> 04:02:20,510
Rykov, and we steal his clothes.

3171
04:02:21,070 --> 04:02:21,590
Yes, yes.

3172
04:02:22,870 --> 04:02:25,630
That's what we're doing right now, everybody, in case you forgot.

3173
04:02:26,930 --> 04:02:27,410
Okay.

3174
04:02:29,760 --> 04:02:31,420
Are they walking down here?

3175
04:02:31,560 --> 04:02:32,380
I see one guy.

3176
04:02:41,320 --> 04:02:46,580
Right now, I'm kind of gathering supplies, but I'm also waiting for these bozos to leave.

3177
04:02:48,820 --> 04:02:50,040
You did not see me.

3178
04:02:57,200 --> 04:02:58,580
They're such on high alert.

3179
04:03:06,700 --> 04:03:09,420
I'm doing the espionage stealth stuff.

3180
04:03:11,020 --> 04:03:12,260
I'm playing the game.

3181
04:03:15,340 --> 04:03:16,580
I'm playing the game.

3182
04:03:42,850 --> 04:03:45,230
Did you hear me change my clothes?

3183
04:03:45,750 --> 04:03:46,430
There's no way.

3184
04:03:50,110 --> 04:03:51,310
There's nobody here.

3185
04:03:53,090 --> 04:03:53,930
Yeah, nobody here.

3186
04:03:54,550 --> 04:03:55,630
Nothing here.

3187
04:03:57,650 --> 04:03:58,710
That's what the kids say, right?

3188
04:03:59,690 --> 04:04:00,590
Nothing here.

3189
04:04:01,630 --> 04:04:02,550
Where am I, anyway?

3190
04:04:05,190 --> 04:04:06,150
Oh, there we go.

3191
04:04:07,650 --> 04:04:08,250
Oh my gosh.

3192
04:04:08,950 --> 04:04:10,110
They're not going to come over here, are they?

3193
04:04:12,170 --> 04:04:13,810
I wish I could drag them under the car.

3194
04:04:15,810 --> 04:04:16,930
Can I grab your toes?

3195
04:04:18,190 --> 04:04:20,150
Oh, he looks like so comfy, though.

3196
04:04:20,690 --> 04:04:20,910
Wait.

3197
04:04:23,330 --> 04:04:24,570
Oh, I thought that was a movie.

3198
04:04:25,230 --> 04:04:27,310
You know how, like, some of the guys have a secret theater?

3199
04:04:28,170 --> 04:04:28,490
Tapes.

3200
04:04:29,770 --> 04:04:32,290
I haven't bothered looking at any of them, I'll be honest.

3201
04:04:37,750 --> 04:04:38,710
Oh, I thought that was a person.

3202
04:04:39,310 --> 04:04:40,230
We're almost out of caution.

3203
04:04:42,430 --> 04:04:42,750
Oh.

3204
04:04:43,010 --> 04:04:44,690
I could climb the ladder.

3205
04:04:45,730 --> 04:04:46,850
Oh, no, I could not.

3206
04:04:56,270 --> 04:04:56,730
What's wrong?

3207
04:04:58,270 --> 04:04:59,070
What's wrong?

3208
04:05:07,340 --> 04:05:09,000
He's not going to see me under here, is he?

3209
04:05:09,140 --> 04:05:09,620
Oh, okay.

3210
04:05:10,300 --> 04:05:11,940
Can you imagine if he, like, opens his eyes?

3211
04:05:12,580 --> 04:05:15,220
Like, oh, looks directly at me.

3212
04:05:16,580 --> 04:05:18,460
No, the caution went back up.

3213
04:05:23,560 --> 04:05:24,140
You know what?

3214
04:05:24,140 --> 04:05:26,540
I'm going to try getting on the roof once they leave.

3215
04:05:28,060 --> 04:05:29,360
Three of you, get out of here.

3216
04:05:31,100 --> 04:05:32,400
What are your toes doing?

3217
04:05:35,540 --> 04:05:37,280
Leave, are you cold?

3218
04:05:37,540 --> 04:05:38,060
You're shaking.

3219
04:05:42,180 --> 04:05:43,820
I could have drank them, I suppose.

3220
04:05:46,380 --> 04:05:51,520
Probably if I had done a stun grenade, it would have been good.

3221
04:06:00,930 --> 04:06:03,290
Oh my gosh, you kidding me?

3222
04:06:04,310 --> 04:06:08,270
I don't care, I'm going.

3223
04:06:09,170 --> 04:06:10,190
This is HQ.

3224
04:06:11,730 --> 04:06:12,110
Patrol here!

3225
04:06:12,170 --> 04:06:12,450
Climb!

3226
04:06:13,550 --> 04:06:13,730
Climb!

3227
04:06:23,250 --> 04:06:24,450
Uh, where do I go?

3228
04:06:34,440 --> 04:06:36,040
I see you!

3229
04:06:49,420 --> 04:06:50,100
Scientist!

3230
04:06:50,740 --> 04:06:51,960
I'm a scientist!

3231
04:06:54,360 --> 04:06:54,620
I'm a scientist?

3232
04:06:54,620 --> 04:06:55,720
How's your first blind playthrough?

3233
04:06:56,760 --> 04:06:58,280
I'm a scientist?

3234
04:07:02,640 --> 04:07:03,320
Um...

3235
04:07:03,320 --> 04:07:07,800
Whatever's going on out there has got nothing to do with this crack.

3236
04:07:19,130 --> 04:07:19,610
Woo!

3237
04:07:20,550 --> 04:07:21,690
They do know?

3238
04:07:22,710 --> 04:07:23,750
Um, hello?

3239
04:07:25,590 --> 04:07:28,670
Snake, that door can't be opened by normal means.

3240
04:07:29,350 --> 04:07:32,730
Apparently it operates by responding to a specific radio frequency.

3241
04:07:33,270 --> 04:07:37,590
If you want to know the key frequency, why don't you try asking someone nearby?

3242
04:07:38,490 --> 04:07:40,490
Uh, not the time, Eva!

3243
04:07:43,350 --> 04:07:44,410
Watch this.

3244
04:08:14,540 --> 04:08:18,200
No, I'm a scientist, please.

3245
04:08:18,640 --> 04:08:19,380
I'm just a scientist.

3246
04:08:20,040 --> 04:08:20,540
I'm just a scientist.

3247
04:08:21,740 --> 04:08:22,620
I'm going to go hide in the bathroom.

3248
04:08:25,460 --> 04:08:26,240
I need

3249
04:08:43,730 --> 04:08:44,590
your face.

3250
04:08:45,510 --> 04:08:49,920
I need your face.

3251
04:08:51,520 --> 04:08:51,920
Can

3252
04:08:58,470 --> 04:08:59,770
I have your clothes, please?

3253
04:09:01,190 --> 04:09:01,870
Oh, hello.

3254
04:09:03,830 --> 04:09:04,850
Don't mind me what I'm doing.

3255
04:09:04,870 --> 04:09:06,990
This is average...

3256
04:09:06,990 --> 04:09:09,230
This is very normal behavior for...

3257
04:09:09,230 --> 04:09:10,930
for Rykov, you know?

3258
04:09:12,450 --> 04:09:14,590
This is like super normal behavior for him!

3259
04:09:16,190 --> 04:09:17,610
Don't judge him!

3260
04:09:18,170 --> 04:09:19,390
What he does with his life!

3261
04:09:20,190 --> 04:09:22,210
What are we doing here, huh, everybody?

3262
04:09:22,450 --> 04:09:24,130
What are we doing here?

3263
04:09:26,410 --> 04:09:27,770
This is who he...

3264
04:09:27,770 --> 04:09:27,970
This is who he...

3265
04:09:27,970 --> 04:09:28,330
Whoops, my bad.

3266
04:09:28,610 --> 04:09:29,890
This is who he wants to be.

3267
04:09:30,950 --> 04:09:32,030
Let's cure a little.

3268
04:09:32,610 --> 04:09:36,710
Do you think it's the blood that makes it look like I'm not a scientist.

3269
04:09:39,130 --> 04:09:40,350
Do you think it's that?

3270
04:09:40,910 --> 04:09:43,210
Or, like, what can I improve?

3271
04:09:45,090 --> 04:09:47,010
Oh, no, I did not mean to use that.

3272
04:09:48,050 --> 04:09:49,590
Disinfect and bandage.

3273
04:09:52,610 --> 04:09:53,770
I'll have another one.

3274
04:09:54,150 --> 04:09:54,810
Ha-ha, crazy.

3275
04:09:59,470 --> 04:10:00,370
I'm bleeding.

3276
04:10:03,270 --> 04:10:04,030
There we go.

3277
04:10:04,590 --> 04:10:05,150
Snake, you okay?

3278
04:10:05,690 --> 04:10:06,730
He's looking a little...

3279
04:10:10,190 --> 04:10:11,470
He's looking a little...

3280
04:10:11,470 --> 04:10:12,630
Wait, go up?

3281
04:10:12,730 --> 04:10:13,390
There we go.

3282
04:10:17,910 --> 04:10:20,910
Beep, pop, beep, beep, brr, brr, brr, brr.

3283
04:10:24,000 --> 04:10:24,860
Oh, are they coming in?

3284
04:10:26,780 --> 04:10:28,340
Oh, I meant to take off my camo.

3285
04:10:28,500 --> 04:10:28,900
There we go.

3286
04:10:32,810 --> 04:10:33,470
Looks so good.

3287
04:10:34,830 --> 04:10:35,770
You're looking a little bony.

3288
04:10:38,630 --> 04:10:41,330
If everyone's asleep, no one can bother us anymore.

3289
04:10:41,930 --> 04:10:42,550
I see him.

3290
04:10:44,670 --> 04:10:45,110
Human!

3291
04:10:52,220 --> 04:10:52,680
Oh, a scientist?

3292
04:10:53,280 --> 04:10:54,220
An actual scientist?

3293
04:10:55,440 --> 04:10:56,680
I think the crock hat?

3294
04:10:56,980 --> 04:10:57,980
You're so right.

3295
04:11:02,900 --> 04:11:05,100
Okay, we're gonna start taking our boy over.

3296
04:11:07,640 --> 04:11:09,120
I wish I could carry him on my back.

3297
04:11:28,080 --> 04:11:28,780
How did I miss?

3298
04:11:29,460 --> 04:11:30,660
Hey, he's right in front of you!

3299
04:11:31,200 --> 04:11:32,060
How could you miss?

3300
04:11:32,300 --> 04:11:34,400
Oops, I think I got the...

3301
04:11:37,660 --> 04:11:38,580
Alright, scientist.

3302
04:11:39,700 --> 04:11:40,200
Chill out!

3303
04:11:41,040 --> 04:11:42,420
I don't want anything to do with you.

3304
04:11:43,440 --> 04:11:44,980
There we go.

3305
04:11:48,900 --> 04:11:49,980
This is how you do this mission?

3306
04:11:51,100 --> 04:11:51,360
Real.

3307
04:11:53,760 --> 04:11:55,240
This is how you do this mission.

3308
04:11:55,660 --> 04:11:56,080
For real.

3309
04:11:57,460 --> 04:11:58,200
Who's there?

3310
04:11:59,720 --> 04:12:02,920
I like how the whole thing lights up.

3311
04:12:09,100 --> 04:12:09,880
Uh oh.

3312
04:12:17,080 --> 04:12:18,740
As long as we get to the lockers.

3313
04:12:20,640 --> 04:12:21,740
We'll be okay.

3314
04:12:21,840 --> 04:12:22,180
Hey!

3315
04:12:23,880 --> 04:12:24,840
I'm working here.

3316
04:12:29,300 --> 04:12:30,160
Stop yelling.

3317
04:12:31,080 --> 04:12:31,840
Help me.

3318
04:12:32,420 --> 04:12:33,720
Nobody's coming for you, nerds.

3319
04:12:38,080 --> 04:12:39,580
Nobody's coming for you, nerds.

3320
04:12:42,700 --> 04:12:44,200
Is it this one?

3321
04:12:56,440 --> 04:12:58,380
I could have sworn it was him.

3322
04:13:00,060 --> 04:13:00,340
Oh,

3323
04:13:03,880 --> 04:13:05,100
you need to be out of alert?

3324
04:13:05,620 --> 04:13:06,080
No kidding.

3325
04:13:09,200 --> 04:13:10,280
Can't during alert.

3326
04:13:10,580 --> 04:13:10,920
Okay, okay.

3327
04:13:17,020 --> 04:13:18,340
We're patient, people.

3328
04:13:22,120 --> 04:13:23,340
Oh, my suppressor.

3329
04:13:23,880 --> 04:13:24,440
No, no, no, no.

3330
04:13:24,900 --> 04:13:25,200
Oh,

3331
04:13:28,490 --> 04:13:29,070
my gosh.

3332
04:13:29,790 --> 04:13:30,170
Oh, my God.

3333
04:13:30,330 --> 04:13:30,450
Wait.

3334
04:13:36,080 --> 04:13:36,440
Damn it.

3335
04:13:36,580 --> 04:13:37,820
You reset my timer.

3336
04:13:44,220 --> 04:13:45,020
Oh, I can't hear it, though.

3337
04:13:54,800 --> 04:13:56,180
It was the last guy, yeah.

3338
04:13:56,520 --> 04:13:57,020
Easy peasy.

3339
04:13:58,080 --> 04:13:58,460
Wait.

3340
04:13:58,600 --> 04:13:58,880
Oh, my God.

3341
04:13:58,960 --> 04:14:00,100
I'm going to see his tidy wadies.

3342
04:14:01,580 --> 04:14:14,380

04:15:04,280 --> 04:15:05,080
About saving.

3348
04:15:05,240 --> 04:15:05,700
We're all good.

3349
04:15:06,020 --> 04:15:07,240
Don't worry about it.

3350
04:15:07,680 --> 04:15:08,280
Thank you, though.

3351
04:15:09,580 --> 04:15:12,040
Yeah, auto saves really well, so it's nice.

3352
04:15:12,680 --> 04:15:13,400
It's nice.

3353
04:15:13,640 --> 04:15:14,160
It's nice.

3354
04:15:18,020 --> 04:15:20,840
Oh, but the paramedic movie conversations, you know what?

3355
04:15:20,940 --> 04:15:21,580
That's so true.

3356
04:15:21,880 --> 04:15:22,480
It's been a while.

3357
04:15:23,300 --> 04:15:24,860
Actually, I don't think I've done one at all today.

3358
04:15:25,000 --> 04:15:26,060
We'll do one right after this.

3359
04:15:26,940 --> 04:15:28,220
Let me open these first.

3360
04:15:28,500 --> 04:15:29,060
And then we'll save.

3361
04:15:35,500 --> 04:15:44,640
Saluting the locker for being a great security vessel for stuff.

3362
04:15:46,600 --> 04:15:50,260
Oh, a proper ration!

3363
04:15:56,230 --> 04:15:57,130
More suppressive.

3364
04:16:10,270 --> 04:16:12,150
This is great!

3365
04:16:20,210 --> 04:16:20,890
Wait.

3366
04:16:22,410 --> 04:16:22,410
Wait.

3367
04:16:24,770 --> 04:16:26,570
Ah, I keep... There we go.

3368
04:16:26,810 --> 04:16:28,270
Okay, now we can do it.

3369
04:16:36,080 --> 04:16:38,520
Can I see his...

3370
04:16:53,440 --> 04:16:55,140
Snake Cove, what do you think of this?

3371
04:16:59,430 --> 04:17:00,310
What is...

3372
04:17:03,930 --> 04:17:05,970
Look at the convenient sensor.

3373
04:17:06,130 --> 04:17:07,570
Wait, it makes it sexier.

3374
04:17:08,450 --> 04:17:10,370
Because you can't tell that he's wearing a thong.

3375
04:17:11,530 --> 04:17:12,990
It makes it way sexier.

3376
04:17:13,130 --> 04:17:16,030
You can't tell he's wearing a thong, so he just looks booted naked.

3377
04:17:21,250 --> 04:17:23,390
A new thumbnail?

3378
04:17:29,820 --> 04:17:30,380
Wowie!

3379
04:17:30,940 --> 04:17:31,980
Hold on.

3380
04:17:32,180 --> 04:17:34,580
I want to like...

3381
04:17:34,580 --> 04:17:36,120
It's from this side now.

3382
04:17:36,340 --> 04:17:36,840
From this side.

3383
04:17:38,240 --> 04:17:38,880
Thank you!

3384
04:17:38,880 --> 04:17:39,480
Thank you!

3385
04:17:41,780 --> 04:17:43,320
Okay, maybe this works.

3386
04:17:43,460 --> 04:17:44,640
Oh, look, wrong button.

3387
04:17:48,820 --> 04:17:50,840
To quote Half-Life, Booty Shot!

3388
04:17:50,960 --> 04:17:51,780
Booty Shot!

3389
04:17:58,220 --> 04:17:59,380
It's hard to...

3390
04:17:59,380 --> 04:18:00,420
Oh, wait.

3391
04:18:01,340 --> 04:18:04,900
Oh, my goodness.

3392
04:18:07,140 --> 04:18:08,780
Wait, I want to up the brightness a little.

3393
04:18:12,820 --> 04:18:16,180
Wow, he's so smooth.

3394
04:18:17,780 --> 04:18:19,320
Do I need to call HR for harassment?

3395
04:18:23,560 --> 04:18:24,120
No.

3396
04:18:25,480 --> 04:18:25,920
No.

3397
04:18:26,580 --> 04:18:26,900
No.

3398
04:18:27,520 --> 04:18:27,960
Ah,

3399
04:18:35,250 --> 04:18:36,030
yeah, sniff him.

3400
04:18:36,910 --> 04:18:42,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3401
04:18:47,570 --> 04:18:49,010
I can't get a good shot.

3402
04:18:55,450 --> 04:18:56,330
I'm concerned.

3403
04:18:56,870 --> 04:18:57,390
Don't be.

3404
04:18:58,410 --> 04:18:59,430
Okay, let's get him up.

3405
04:19:00,670 --> 04:19:01,750
All right, come on, come on.

3406
04:19:02,270 --> 04:19:02,850
Come here, baby.

3407
04:19:03,610 --> 04:19:04,490
Come here, little girl.

3408
04:19:08,510 --> 04:19:09,350
Come here!

3409
04:19:09,750 --> 04:19:11,330
Why did I call him like my cat?

3410
04:19:16,460 --> 04:19:16,940
Okay.

3411
04:19:20,660 --> 04:19:22,340
Oh wait, I can't- oh, I can't change it?

3412
04:19:22,420 --> 04:19:22,560
Okay.

3413
04:19:34,450 --> 04:19:36,250
I can't change the camera at all?

3414
04:19:37,410 --> 04:19:38,610
This is still good.

3415
04:19:40,130 --> 04:19:42,170
This is good, isn't it?

3416
04:19:42,970 --> 04:19:43,830
To quote Metal Gear.

3417
04:19:44,710 --> 04:19:45,090
Oh wait.

3418
04:19:50,980 --> 04:19:51,460
Oops.

3419
04:19:52,060 --> 04:19:53,000
That's a loop.

3420
04:19:59,750 --> 04:20:01,090
Another ration.

3421
04:20:02,310 --> 04:20:03,770
We will take it.

3422
04:20:06,090 --> 04:20:07,590
I know.

3423
04:20:07,750 --> 04:20:08,690
It's an emotional quote.

3424
04:20:08,850 --> 04:20:11,210
And I'm using it in such a disgusting way.

3425
04:20:17,450 --> 04:20:20,830
Yeah, this is Ryden from Fortnite.

3426
04:20:21,490 --> 04:20:24,630
Ryden Metal Gear Solid 2 from Fortnite.

3427
04:20:31,520 --> 04:20:32,740
It's just trees?

3428
04:20:37,200 --> 04:20:38,560
Someone call paramedic.

3429
04:20:38,720 --> 04:20:39,520
I'm laughing so hard.

3430
04:20:39,680 --> 04:20:40,240
I can't breathe.

3431
04:20:44,760 --> 04:20:45,640
Just trees.

3432
04:20:52,220 --> 04:20:57,820
Well, now that we can do anything that we feel like, we can be a little freakazoid and nobody will judge us.

3433
04:20:59,000 --> 04:21:01,460
Not that that was ever going to stop me, but...

3434
04:21:01,460 --> 04:21:02,440
Wait, I'm stupid.

3435
04:21:02,600 --> 04:21:02,860
What?

3436
04:21:04,780 --> 04:21:07,980
Wait, oh my gosh, it's so exciting to see Rykov crawl.

3437
04:21:08,200 --> 04:21:10,280
Not crawl, but like, oh, we got the handkerchief.

3438
04:21:13,680 --> 04:21:15,680
We can see him, like, crouch walk.

3439
04:21:18,640 --> 04:21:23,080
He looks like a real gremlin right now.

3440
04:21:25,440 --> 04:21:28,020
He looks like a true gremlin right now.

3441
04:21:28,260 --> 04:21:29,740
Okay, now everyone's gonna love me.

3442
04:21:30,380 --> 04:21:31,680
Team, are we still awake?

3443
04:21:42,010 --> 04:21:47,350
This is your boss speaking.

3444
04:21:51,080 --> 04:21:52,180
Hey, nerd.

3445
04:21:59,540 --> 04:22:00,600
It's me.

3446
04:22:01,340 --> 04:22:02,580
It's me.

3447
04:22:02,640 --> 04:22:03,340
Yeah, shiver.

3448
04:22:03,940 --> 04:22:04,380
Shiver.

3449
04:22:05,160 --> 04:22:09,880
Shiver at my sight.

3450
04:22:14,760 --> 04:22:17,040
Look how close he gets.

3451
04:22:17,760 --> 04:22:18,760
Oh, did you hear that?

3452
04:22:21,480 --> 04:22:22,840
Somebody's hungry.

3453
04:22:25,240 --> 04:22:27,940
This is horrible.

3454
04:22:44,780 --> 04:22:45,700
You gotta pee yourself?

3455
04:22:46,780 --> 04:22:47,860
You gotta pee yourself?

3456
04:22:57,070 --> 04:22:59,430
Nothing unusual is happening here.

3457
04:23:03,570 --> 04:23:04,530
What's wrong?

3458
04:23:08,670 --> 04:23:10,270
Oh my god, wait!

3459
04:23:11,290 --> 04:23:12,750
Oh, he's just a sleepy guy.

3460
04:23:18,060 --> 04:23:19,460
I love having full rain!

3461
04:23:20,320 --> 04:23:21,840
I'm doing anything that I want!

3462
04:23:24,240 --> 04:23:24,960
Salute me!

3463
04:23:26,000 --> 04:23:27,520
Um, you were not fast enough.

3464
04:23:34,950 --> 04:23:37,670
I thought he... I thought I knocked him out of bounds for a second.

3465
04:23:39,090 --> 04:23:40,970
You are so welcome.

3466
04:23:41,250 --> 04:23:42,930
This is what it's like on Mother Base, too.

3467
04:23:44,010 --> 04:23:44,970
Thanks for that, boss.

3468
04:23:46,170 --> 04:23:46,410
Salute.

3469
04:23:46,890 --> 04:23:48,710
You were not fast enough.

3470
04:23:50,070 --> 04:23:50,910
What's going on?

3471
04:23:51,230 --> 04:23:51,930
It's me!

3472
04:23:54,190 --> 04:23:55,470
What's going on?

3473
04:23:59,040 --> 04:24:00,920
Don't question my authority.

3474
04:24:05,320 --> 04:24:06,420
Full on antidotes.

3475
04:24:06,900 --> 04:24:07,300
Get up there.

3476
04:24:07,520 --> 04:24:07,760
Stop.

3477
04:24:08,260 --> 04:24:09,040
Get up there.

3478
04:24:11,060 --> 04:24:11,740
Bandage.

3479
04:24:12,360 --> 04:24:13,560
I do need more of those.

3480
04:24:13,760 --> 04:24:14,120
No, please.

3481
04:24:16,840 --> 04:24:17,710
Stop it.

3482
04:24:19,020 --> 04:24:19,240
Climb.

3483
04:24:21,760 --> 04:24:22,880
Climb up.

3484
04:24:25,740 --> 04:24:27,080
There was something else.

3485
04:24:27,840 --> 04:24:28,040
No?

3486
04:24:28,380 --> 04:24:28,920
Just kidding.

3487
04:24:35,020 --> 04:24:35,600
Hello.

3488
04:24:35,700 --> 04:24:38,360
No, thanks for opening this, actually.

3489
04:24:46,670 --> 04:24:47,470
Room that...

3490
04:24:48,330 --> 04:24:48,910
Scorpion.

3491
04:24:50,210 --> 04:24:53,910
Room that they were like, you need the magic code to go in.

3492
04:24:55,290 --> 04:24:57,470
Or a man that will do it for you.

3493
04:24:58,870 --> 04:25:06,890
So you think this woke up something in Snake or I mean, we know what wakes up in Osalot very soon.

3494
04:25:07,630 --> 04:25:07,910
Sir.

3495
04:25:10,950 --> 04:25:11,410
Thank you.

3496
04:25:11,530 --> 04:25:11,950
You know what?

3497
04:25:11,970 --> 04:25:14,150
I'll leave you alone because you let me into the room.

3498
04:25:16,810 --> 04:25:18,090
And then we were in here.

3499
04:25:18,750 --> 04:25:19,330
Wait, what's this?

3500
04:25:23,170 --> 04:25:27,990
Mousetrap I don't think I was able to grab it before

3501
04:25:31,330 --> 04:25:42,150
Anybody peeing I wish what I wanted to do was put on the Rykov mask When you see Rykov because I love his reaction He's kind of like

3502
04:25:46,290 --> 04:25:49,310
Cute Cute

3503
04:25:53,890 --> 04:25:54,890
Salute me!

3504
04:25:58,410 --> 04:26:00,890
Yeah, that's what I'll do to you if you don't salute me.

3505
04:26:05,010 --> 04:26:05,390
Gamer.

3506
04:26:07,670 --> 04:26:08,210
Nothing here?

3507
04:26:09,030 --> 04:26:10,070
Nothing here.

3508
04:26:11,730 --> 04:26:19,070
I'm starting to get hungry, but we're approaching the point that I wanted to stop at, or rather I wanted to get to at least.

3509
04:26:19,230 --> 04:26:21,110
We're almost there, so...

3510
04:26:22,350 --> 04:26:26,150
Um, we have a quite, uh, we have a bit of a long cutscene coming up.

3511
04:26:28,070 --> 04:26:31,050
You know, also raid pantry or ammo sheds outside.

3512
04:26:31,930 --> 04:26:32,670
You're right!

3513
04:26:32,990 --> 04:26:36,990
Before I go, you're right, you're right, you're right.

3514
04:26:38,450 --> 04:26:41,070
We have some of my favorite cutscenes in the whole game.

3515
04:26:47,040 --> 04:26:50,440
I wanted to get, um, to... what's it called?

3516
04:26:52,540 --> 04:26:53,060
Uh...

3517
04:26:54,080 --> 04:27:05,960

3520
04:27:34,620 --> 04:27:43,020
i wonder what's inside nothing but probably a bunch of rats Pantry's on the other side.

3521
04:27:43,180 --> 04:27:43,340
Wait.

3522
04:27:45,900 --> 04:27:48,360
I'm just, right now I'm just looking for any sort of items.

3523
04:27:48,580 --> 04:27:49,680
Anything just lying about.

3524
04:27:50,940 --> 04:27:51,560
No, no, no.

3525
04:27:53,000 --> 04:27:53,960
Other side where, though?

3526
04:27:54,160 --> 04:27:54,300
Sir.

3527
04:27:54,800 --> 04:27:55,000
Hello.

3528
04:28:04,000 --> 04:28:06,020
I'm starting to get really hungry, actually.

3529
04:28:06,140 --> 04:28:06,580
Oh, here we go.

3530
04:28:08,860 --> 04:28:09,660
No, climb.

3531
04:28:10,720 --> 04:28:10,920
No.

3532
04:28:12,260 --> 04:28:12,660
Climb.

3533
04:28:12,900 --> 04:28:14,360
Oh my gosh.

3534
04:28:15,440 --> 04:28:15,460
Climb!

3535
04:28:16,240 --> 04:28:17,300
I saw...

3536
04:28:17,300 --> 04:28:17,860
Stop!

3537
04:28:18,400 --> 04:28:19,000
Climb!

3538
04:28:19,340 --> 04:28:19,720
Climb!

3539
04:28:19,880 --> 04:28:20,260
There we go.

3540
04:28:21,400 --> 04:28:21,540
Oh.

3541
04:28:22,380 --> 04:28:22,820
Nice.

3542
04:28:37,860 --> 04:28:38,520
Nice.

3543
04:28:39,100 --> 04:28:39,980
Nice.

3544
04:28:40,520 --> 04:28:41,040
Nice.

3545
04:28:42,780 --> 04:28:50,340
That should be good.

3546
04:28:50,560 --> 04:28:51,520
We got some food.

3547
04:28:51,980 --> 04:28:53,080
We got some food.

3548
04:28:54,440 --> 04:28:55,620
I might go grab.

3549
04:28:56,120 --> 04:28:57,700
What should I have as a snack?

3550
04:28:58,180 --> 04:28:59,320
I don't even know what that's for dinner.

3551
04:29:04,370 --> 04:29:06,470
You do remember you'll lose all of this, right?

3552
04:29:06,970 --> 04:29:08,670
You don't lose calorie, mate.

3553
04:29:09,590 --> 04:29:10,170
Those are all...

3554
04:29:10,170 --> 04:29:13,030
I grabbed calorie, mate, and ration.

3555
04:29:13,170 --> 04:29:14,370
Those won't expire at all.

3556
04:29:15,230 --> 04:29:17,670
But we can eat the things that will expire.

3557
04:29:18,210 --> 04:29:19,250
Well, this one...

3558
04:29:19,850 --> 04:29:20,450
I'll eat it.

3559
04:29:22,810 --> 04:29:24,050
I'm gonna puke.

3560
04:29:24,310 --> 04:29:25,910
I said it was supposed to be good.

3561
04:29:29,390 --> 04:29:30,730
I've had enough.

3562
04:29:31,050 --> 04:29:32,510
Oh, he's referring to a certain event.

3563
04:29:33,310 --> 04:29:35,950
Ah, so then is.

3564
04:29:37,370 --> 04:29:38,470
We'll get it back eventually.

3565
04:29:39,210 --> 04:29:39,570
That's fine.

3566
04:29:39,750 --> 04:29:40,270
Don't worry about it.

3567
04:29:41,190 --> 04:29:42,950
I will eat all the things that will go bad, though.

3568
04:29:44,790 --> 04:29:45,950
This is horrible.

3569
04:29:46,310 --> 04:29:47,590
This is horrible.

3570
04:29:48,650 --> 04:29:49,210
Calorie bait.

3571
04:29:49,330 --> 04:29:50,130
We'll eat a calorie bait.

3572
04:29:52,590 --> 04:29:54,090
I want some more.

3573
04:29:54,550 --> 04:29:55,390
I want some more.

3574
04:29:57,490 --> 04:29:59,170
Okay, let's go.

3575
04:30:08,080 --> 04:30:10,580
I like how you can still see him, sir.

3576
04:30:11,700 --> 04:30:12,000
What?

3577
04:30:15,680 --> 04:30:16,980
What did you say to me?

3578
04:30:17,560 --> 04:30:18,840
Keep up the fine work, sir.

3579
04:30:18,840 --> 04:30:19,360
Yeah, that?

3580
04:30:20,120 --> 04:30:20,660
Fine?

3581
04:30:21,040 --> 04:30:24,700
I think it's great work, actually.

3582
04:30:26,260 --> 04:30:27,920
It's amazing work.

3583
04:30:28,560 --> 04:30:28,900
Fine?

3584
04:30:29,640 --> 04:30:29,720
Fine.

3585
04:30:30,240 --> 04:30:32,840
You're asking for a death sentence, aren't you, buddy?

3586
04:30:38,060 --> 04:30:39,580
Fantastic work to you!

3587
04:30:48,270 --> 04:30:50,790
I might be on a bit of a power trip.

3588
04:30:52,150 --> 04:30:52,510
Wait.

3589
04:30:54,150 --> 04:30:55,890
Oh, it's not doing the camera angle.

3590
04:30:56,530 --> 04:30:57,690
Like the cinematic one.

3591
04:30:57,810 --> 04:30:58,570
But it is cool.

3592
04:30:59,030 --> 04:31:00,250
We can just look at it.

3593
04:31:01,350 --> 04:31:01,790
Wow.

3594
04:31:02,490 --> 04:31:03,310
That's her.

3595
04:31:04,830 --> 04:31:06,330
That's the Shagohad!

3596
04:31:07,230 --> 04:31:08,570
In all her glory!

3597
04:31:08,830 --> 04:31:09,970
We'll mimic it.

3598
04:31:21,660 --> 04:31:23,700
I like how you can still see the little men working.

3599
04:31:26,100 --> 04:31:27,900
I'll be a little man in there too.

3600
04:31:31,420 --> 04:31:32,240
She's pretty.

3601
04:31:34,600 --> 04:31:35,960
Okay, do you guys think?

3602
04:31:37,240 --> 04:31:37,800
No.

3603
04:31:38,280 --> 04:31:40,360
If I walk over there...

3604
04:31:41,220 --> 04:31:43,780
And then somehow...

3605
04:31:44,360 --> 04:31:46,920
Change before the cutscene.

3606
04:31:48,940 --> 04:31:52,780
Do you think it would work?

3607
04:31:53,400 --> 04:31:54,760
Keep up the fine work, Minto.

3608
04:31:57,880 --> 04:31:59,560
That's amazing!

3609
04:32:00,020 --> 04:32:03,920
Sputens- I messed it up.

3610
04:32:05,800 --> 04:32:07,800
I messed it up.

3611
04:32:39,310 --> 04:32:40,890
How am I supposed to get him?

3612
04:32:43,190 --> 04:32:44,030
What the hell?

3613
04:32:44,050 --> 04:32:45,190
How is Keto time?

3614
04:32:53,380 --> 04:32:54,860
Anyway, we're going to forget that happened.

3615
04:32:58,460 --> 04:32:58,860
Cheat.

3616
04:33:04,520 --> 04:33:07,360
I hear him going, Gako, too, over there.

3617
04:33:11,410 --> 04:33:12,030
Riden on it.

3618
04:33:12,250 --> 04:33:12,970
Not Riden.

3619
04:33:13,130 --> 04:33:14,610
Sorry, Rikov on his tippy toes.

3620
04:33:15,670 --> 04:33:18,850
If anything, there's a Keto, Gako, and film in this room if you want to mess around.

3621
04:33:19,410 --> 04:33:20,650
Oh, wait, I see the film.

3622
04:33:21,530 --> 04:33:23,390
That's it right there on that guy's...

3623
04:33:23,390 --> 04:33:23,710
Right?

3624
04:33:24,010 --> 04:33:26,010
How do I get it?

3625
04:33:27,330 --> 04:33:27,530
No!

3626
04:33:42,120 --> 04:33:43,160
Damn it.

3627
04:33:53,490 --> 04:33:54,010
Alright.

3628
04:33:55,530 --> 04:33:56,130
Oh well.

3629
04:33:56,470 --> 04:33:57,550
It's fine, it's fine.

3630
04:33:57,970 --> 04:33:58,670
I don't want to reload.

3631
04:33:58,870 --> 04:33:59,890
I don't think there's a way.

3632
04:34:07,900 --> 04:34:09,260
You can count on me.

3633
04:34:10,140 --> 04:34:12,280
When will you guys mod me into the game?

3634
04:34:13,520 --> 04:34:15,040
I don't know anything about that.

3635
04:34:15,080 --> 04:34:18,560
I saw some people already doing like GTA models and stuff.

3636
04:34:19,220 --> 04:34:19,920
What are you?

3637
04:34:21,820 --> 04:34:55,280
kill me what's the matter I know nothing I swear it whoops no one but the Colonel knows of the legacy I see don't she's just being a hot girl oh boy you don't have very many eyelashes left kiss of death she's

3638
04:35:04,810 --> 04:35:05,790
so hot

3639
04:35:11,290 --> 04:35:58,170
this part's not healthy enough for hot girls it's me you're the man from the CIA I mean to what are you doing here I told you before didn't I I'm going to get you out of here a man of honor just like your commander but I'm a afraid you're too late too late too late don't tell me the shagahods exactly the final preparations for phase two are complete uh-oh so glav what exactly is phase two to put it in technical terms it's a composite range extension system for medium range ballistic missiles say that like i'm 12.

3640
04:36:02,210 --> 04:36:09,090
The Shagohod was originally designed as a tank that could launch nuclear missiles from any type of terrain.

3641
04:36:09,130 --> 04:36:10,090
We bought you as the Shagohod?

3642
04:36:10,290 --> 04:36:11,070
Oh my gosh, yes!

3643
04:36:11,090 --> 04:36:13,990
There was just one problem we couldn't figure out how to solve.

3644
04:36:13,990 --> 04:36:15,530
Wait, you just want me on all fours.

3645
04:36:16,070 --> 04:36:21,170
The ICBMs we have today are simply too big for the Shagohod to carry.

3646
04:36:21,290 --> 04:36:22,630
Happy crawling like a...

3647
04:36:22,630 --> 04:36:24,690
But the military would not hear of it.

3648
04:36:25,330 --> 04:36:30,610
They demanded a weapon that could launch a nuclear missile directly into the American homeland.

3649
04:36:32,230 --> 04:36:35,670
That is when I came up with the idea for phase two.

3650
04:36:35,670 --> 04:36:36,690
She's so cute.

3651
04:36:37,050 --> 04:36:39,910
But there's no way you could load an ICBM onto the Shagohod.

3652
04:36:40,930 --> 04:36:41,890
So how'd you do it?

3653
04:36:42,450 --> 04:36:45,230
By accelerating the Shagohod itself.

3654
04:36:45,670 --> 04:36:46,950
She's gonna go fast.

3655
04:36:47,970 --> 04:36:53,270
In phase two, a rocket booster unit is attached to the frame of the Shagohod.

3656
04:36:53,870 --> 04:36:55,490
This design is so bad.

3657
04:36:55,490 --> 04:36:59,590
The unit incorporates the same technology used in the Vostok rocket that sent Major Gagari into space.

3658
04:37:01,070 --> 04:37:04,430
Compared to what Granon had, it's just so bad.

3659
04:37:04,430 --> 04:37:08,190
The Shagohod can achieve a land speed of over 300 miles per hour.

3660
04:37:08,990 --> 04:37:11,990
That monster can go more than 300 miles per hour.

3661
04:37:12,270 --> 04:37:13,750
It's still cool though, yeah.

3662
04:37:14,030 --> 04:37:17,470
As for this state of accelerated motion, it launches a nuclear missile.

3663
04:37:17,870 --> 04:37:21,890
It's just you need a runway to use it.

3664
04:37:21,890 --> 04:37:23,990
The Shagohod acts like the first stage of a rocket.

3665
04:37:24,890 --> 04:37:25,670
Yes, precisely.

3666
04:37:26,670 --> 04:37:29,410
The range of the missile launched by the Shagohod.

3667
04:37:29,590 --> 04:38:00,670
look how much increases from 2500 miles to 6,000 miles 6,000 miles that's enough to strike anywhere in the United States not only that with the Shagohard there's no need to construct giant silos like the ones used to house ICBMs all you need is a runaway about three miles in length all you need is three miles and you can launch a thermonuclear strike against any location in the United States from anywhere in the Soviet Union.

3668
04:38:01,850 --> 04:38:04,650
It cannot be detected by spy planes or satellites.

3669
04:38:05,490 --> 04:38:10,330
It's a mobile fortress capable of deploying in secret and launching its payload at any time.

3670
04:38:11,550 --> 04:38:12,690
A weapon from hell.

3671
04:38:17,840 --> 04:38:20,220
A completed prototype now sits in the hangar.

3672
04:38:20,620 --> 04:38:23,480
At present, it is the only one of its kind.

3673
04:38:24,420 --> 04:38:28,680
But Vulcan is planning to mass-produce them based on that prototype.

3674
04:38:28,760 --> 04:38:31,100
And deploy them all over the Soviet Union.

3675
04:38:31,720 --> 04:38:32,120
Yes.

3676
04:38:32,400 --> 04:38:34,500
And that's not the end of it.

3677
04:38:35,220 --> 04:38:40,140
He's going to ship them to Eastern Europe, to Asia, to all the countries of the Eastern Bloc.

3678
04:38:40,520 --> 04:38:49,900
Even worse, he intends to use the Shagohod as bait to format armed uprisings among dictators, ethnic insurgents, and revolutionary groups throughout the Third World.

3679
04:38:51,400 --> 04:38:53,200
His funds are nearly limitless.

3680
04:38:53,640 --> 04:38:56,260
He could start mass production tomorrow if he wanted.

3681
04:38:57,660 --> 04:40:03,480
The reason that tensions between East and West have settled into a cold war is because each side fears the other's power deter you just don't get it I don't the idea of using don't get me wrong I love the shagohad it's just kind of silly but the shagohad goes far beyond the level of threat it doesn't have the range okay that's true that's true that's true if such a weapon is unleashed on the world it will not be long before all nations are engulfed in conflict the Cold War will end and the entire planet will be consumed by the fires of war is better you're right you're right the Shagohod will be at the center of it all the little pot it looks it looks like something out of peace walker so you see it's already too late no it's not too late what do you mean we've still got a chance all we have to do is destroy the prototype and the whole facility before they can mass produce it exactly but just tell me what i need to do to destroy this place

3682
04:40:06,760 --> 04:40:59,840
all right the liquid fuel used in the rocket engine is stored in a tank if you can blow it up somehow some c3 ought to be enough to blow the entire hangar to smithereens c3 you mean that cutting edge plastic explosive it could be molded into any shape the bomb of the future where can i get it there was some in the armory here but it's gone now it was stolen by a female spy who was here a minute ago eva no that's not her name her name is tatiana she made her way in here by becoming volkin's lover oh my god i thought she was your lover wait we get to see his wife no she is volkin's lover This is my lover.

3683
04:40:59,840 --> 04:41:00,740
Would you love me if I were a Shagohat?

3684
04:41:01,180 --> 04:41:03,340
She's so ugly, wait.

3685
04:41:06,260 --> 04:41:07,400
Who are they?

3686
04:41:07,500 --> 04:41:08,080
My wife.

3687
04:41:08,740 --> 04:41:09,260
And daughter.

3688
04:41:10,120 --> 04:41:10,840
They're in America.

3689
04:41:13,200 --> 04:41:13,980
Now I remember.

3690
04:41:14,420 --> 04:41:16,240
Your family is in the custody of the CIA.

3691
04:41:16,320 --> 04:41:17,740
She looks like Nosferat.

3692
04:41:19,700 --> 04:41:21,700
How long has Tatiana been here?

3693
04:41:22,680 --> 04:41:24,000
Only a few weeks.

3694
04:41:24,680 --> 04:41:26,960
A few days before the Virtuous Mission then.

3695
04:41:27,900 --> 04:42:00,840
she said that Khrushchev sent her what did you just give her I didn't expect the picture to be so high all of the experimental data for the Shagohod please it is essential that you destroy the Shagohod I will but first I've got to get you to safety no I'm not going oh I'm so glad my mission is to rescue you leave me I see why snake had nightmares about vampires.

3696
04:42:01,960 --> 04:42:03,880
Khrushchev has abandoned me.

3697
04:42:05,620 --> 04:42:07,120
I cannot return to my country.

3698
04:42:08,320 --> 04:42:10,400
I would most certainly be sent to the Gulag's.

3699
04:42:10,420 --> 04:42:12,680
I've been waiting for that the whole screen, you guys.

3700
04:42:15,200 --> 04:42:16,960
Yes, I once thought of that.

3701
04:42:17,420 --> 04:42:18,360
Oh, I'm so happy.

3702
04:42:18,440 --> 04:42:19,920
My family's waiting for me there.

3703
04:42:20,500 --> 04:42:21,320
She looks like my tour feels so impressive.

3704
04:42:21,320 --> 04:42:27,260
Even if I fled to the United States, I would once again find myself creating weapons of magic.

3705
04:42:27,280 --> 04:42:28,040
Mass murder.

3706
04:42:28,720 --> 04:42:29,740
144.75.

3707
04:42:29,980 --> 04:42:32,100
In the end, it doesn't matter where I go.

3708
04:42:34,700 --> 04:42:36,660
I am still a weapons scientist.

3709
04:42:39,600 --> 04:42:40,580
Okay, I ought to come.

3710
04:42:40,600 --> 04:42:42,180
To be honest with you, I'm tired.

3711
04:42:46,040 --> 04:42:51,580
Every day I help create things that should never be used, things that should never have existed in the first place.

3712
04:42:52,240 --> 04:42:53,680
Every day, without sleep.

3713
04:42:56,440 --> 04:42:58,160
Without a word of praise from others.

3714
04:42:58,840 --> 04:43:00,180
You're doing a good job.

3715
04:43:00,360 --> 04:43:02,320
And my creations do not even benefit mankind.

3716
04:43:06,860 --> 04:43:09,340
They are merely the tools of politicians.

3717
04:43:11,660 --> 04:43:15,460
All I wanted to do was build space rockets.

3718
04:43:17,380 --> 04:43:18,820
But it was not to be.

3719
04:43:19,800 --> 04:43:23,760
The space race between America and Russia became the prey of politicians.

3720
04:43:25,280 --> 04:43:28,300
The space race and the arms race are one and the same.

3721
04:43:30,100 --> 04:43:31,080
Missiles, rockets.

3722
04:43:31,260 --> 04:43:32,460
What's the difference?

3723
04:43:34,360 --> 04:43:36,420
Scientists are always being used.

3724
04:43:41,220 --> 04:43:42,820
Please, watch over my family.

3725
04:43:47,520 --> 04:43:48,940
That kid's got her nose.

3726
04:44:06,100 --> 04:44:07,520
God, it's so scary.

3727
04:44:07,780 --> 04:44:09,300
The mask is so bad-looking.

3728
04:44:11,220 --> 04:44:11,700
Oh.

3729
04:44:16,380 --> 04:44:18,720
Major, what are you doing here?

3730
04:44:19,780 --> 04:44:21,120
I've been waiting for you in my room.

3731
04:44:30,140 --> 04:44:31,180
Excuse me.

3732
04:44:31,640 --> 04:44:32,060
Excuse you.

3733
04:44:34,400 --> 04:44:35,440
The grip.

3734
04:44:41,970 --> 04:44:43,310
Who are you?

3735
04:44:43,990 --> 04:44:45,290
Don't play dumb with me.

3736
04:44:46,570 --> 04:45:09,160
If you think you can fool me, mistaken I know the major better than anyone else I come here looking for Tatiana and what should I find it look like Vulcan grew more hair in the side greasy free-booter oh gosh

3737
04:45:13,410 --> 04:45:26,990
took him down easy uh-oh you just had to come and ruin it.

3738
04:45:27,750 --> 04:45:28,150
Look

3739
04:45:37,100 --> 04:45:38,280
how it makes no expression.

3740
04:45:38,500 --> 04:45:39,800
It really just looks like a mask.

3741
04:45:43,750 --> 04:45:45,250
What is this fairy disguise?

3742
04:45:47,430 --> 04:45:48,730
It's gonna rub off on you.

3743
04:45:49,090 --> 04:45:50,270
What is this fairy disguise?

3744
04:45:50,490 --> 04:45:52,430
And then you'll lose sight of who you really are.

3745
04:45:52,490 --> 04:45:53,410
Not a fairy, I'm a ghost.

3746
04:46:01,290 --> 04:46:02,510
Stay out of this.

3747
04:46:05,010 --> 04:46:07,910
Everyone gets their ass handed to by the pod.

3748
04:46:09,130 --> 04:46:52,280
so great I see why they call you the boss what was that some kind of judo no it's called CQC a basic form of close quarters combat she's so cool he and I developed it together she's so cool she's so cool I'll take it from here are you but first I get that wound on isn't it I will make him pay for hurting Ivan bye-bye

3749
04:47:24,010 --> 04:47:35,320
time to watch his brain chemistry alter again oh boss is so conflicted Oh, I still watch.

3750
04:47:39,840 --> 04:47:40,520
Oh,

3751
04:47:55,330 --> 04:47:56,570
all the blood on the ground.

3752
04:47:57,550 --> 04:47:58,470
Is that his or Sokolov's?

3753
04:48:03,370 --> 04:48:04,050
Oh,

3754
04:48:13,480 --> 04:48:14,160
my.

3755
04:48:14,440 --> 04:48:15,680
It could be both, right?

3756
04:48:23,030 --> 04:48:24,450
Standing is crazy.

3757
04:48:32,960 --> 04:48:35,380
That's how I felt like during the Fury fight.

3758
04:48:35,720 --> 04:48:36,960
Just wombo comboed.

3759
04:48:43,370 --> 04:48:44,490
So bad.

3760
04:48:46,370 --> 04:48:47,650
Still want to stop on you.

3761
04:48:47,730 --> 04:48:48,930
I never said a snake.

3762
04:48:51,630 --> 04:48:53,310
I never said a snake.

3763
04:48:55,810 --> 04:48:58,310
At least Volga doesn't know about the Ivan picture.

3764
04:48:58,570 --> 04:48:59,090
Tell me.

3765
04:48:59,530 --> 04:49:00,570
Stop it.

3766
04:49:01,630 --> 04:49:03,430
Who have you been talking to?

3767
04:49:03,930 --> 04:49:05,850
He doesn't know what you're talking about.

3768
04:49:08,850 --> 04:49:10,670
You'd better start talking.

3769
04:49:10,950 --> 04:49:12,050
Please, stop this!

3770
04:49:12,970 --> 04:49:15,330
Who is Khrushchev's lap dog?

3771
04:49:15,630 --> 04:49:17,150
How can you do this to him?

3772
04:49:17,330 --> 04:49:19,590
I know you gave the data to someone.

3773
04:49:19,870 --> 04:49:21,210
I'll never do it like that.

3774
04:49:25,970 --> 04:49:26,930
You monster.

3775
04:49:30,400 --> 04:49:32,700
I can like, you can hear him moving around the room.

3776
04:49:32,820 --> 04:49:33,360
It's crazy.

3777
04:49:39,700 --> 04:49:42,140
I guess he's dead.

3778
04:49:42,600 --> 04:49:44,160
That's what I said!

3779
04:49:47,760 --> 04:49:48,920
Rip Sokolov.

3780
04:50:00,520 --> 04:50:06,240
Now then, I hope you'll prove more entertaining than he was.

3781
04:50:08,760 --> 04:50:12,980
But first, let's take a look at your body, shall we?

3782
04:50:13,000 --> 04:50:13,540
My body?

3783
04:50:14,280 --> 04:50:14,680
Yeah?

3784
04:50:15,400 --> 04:50:15,980
Mm-hmm.

3785
04:50:16,340 --> 04:50:16,660
Oh!

3786
04:50:16,660 --> 04:50:47,020
you've certainly seen your share of battles do you like what you see consider yourself lucky I am about to show you what hell is really like well then let's get started what is your target is it the Shagohod or Sokolov or maybe it's the me.

3787
04:50:49,180 --> 04:50:50,240
Answer me!

3788
04:50:51,120 --> 04:50:52,760
Who is helping you?

3789
04:50:53,860 --> 04:50:56,240
Who let you in here?

3790
04:50:59,480 --> 04:51:03,500
You're a tough one, but even you must have your limits.

3791
04:51:04,540 --> 04:51:07,140
And I am a patient man.

3792
04:51:13,190 --> 04:51:14,650
Oh my gosh, Acelot.

3793
04:51:16,630 --> 04:51:17,990
I can't wait.

3794
04:51:18,790 --> 04:51:19,610
I can't wait.

3795
04:51:20,330 --> 04:51:22,330
where the fun really begins.

3796
04:51:26,190 --> 04:51:30,850
My body carries an electric charge for 10 million volts.

3797
04:51:31,830 --> 04:51:33,370
Let's see how you like this.

3798
04:51:34,030 --> 04:51:35,730
Wait, I forgot it zooms in.

3799
04:51:37,990 --> 04:51:43,300
I forgot the zoom in his L2.

3800
04:51:44,640 --> 04:51:46,560
How much does the CIA know?

3801
04:51:55,270 --> 04:51:57,870
They're after my legacy, aren't they?

3802
04:52:01,410 --> 04:52:05,410
Your real target is the Philosopher's Legacy, isn't it?

3803
04:52:08,210 --> 04:52:09,470
Oh my god, isn't it?

3804
04:52:18,720 --> 04:52:22,280
Oh, sorry.

3805
04:52:22,620 --> 04:52:23,560
Yes, yes.

3806
04:52:24,220 --> 04:52:25,480
Let yourself go.

3807
04:52:27,100 --> 04:52:28,940
That's what I want to see.

3808
04:52:31,940 --> 04:52:32,940
He's changing.

3809
04:52:33,580 --> 04:52:36,480
He's like, I think I enjoy all the torture.

3810
04:52:39,640 --> 04:52:40,420
It's no use.

3811
04:52:41,040 --> 04:52:42,060
He's not going to talk.

3812
04:52:44,740 --> 04:52:46,140
He's been trained not to break.

3813
04:52:47,800 --> 04:52:48,840
Trained by me.

3814
04:52:54,060 --> 04:52:54,500
Admit it.

3815
04:52:54,740 --> 04:52:56,260
Or after the location of the legacy.

3816
04:52:58,780 --> 04:53:00,160
Now you better not say it out loud.

3817
04:53:00,180 --> 04:53:03,560
The secret fund established by the three great powers during the two world wars.

3818
04:53:03,580 --> 04:53:06,560
You better not say where it is, if you're villainous, strange.

3819
04:53:10,060 --> 04:53:11,600
100 billion dollars.

3820
04:53:12,020 --> 04:53:14,380
Divided up and hidden all over the world.

3821
04:53:14,460 --> 04:53:17,040
Oh, that's what the Philosopher's Legacy is.

3822
04:53:18,020 --> 04:53:21,820
And you're looking for a record of where all that money is hidden, right?

3823
04:53:23,980 --> 04:53:28,970
You don't know that it's underneath my pillow.

3824
04:53:29,890 --> 04:53:30,190
No matter.

3825
04:53:30,190 --> 04:53:32,850
The Philosopher's Legacy is safely in my possession.

3826
04:53:33,070 --> 04:53:35,610
In the underground vault of Groznikrat.

3827
04:53:35,910 --> 04:53:37,170
Oh, okay, cool.

3828
04:53:37,510 --> 04:53:38,070
Oh, okay.

3829
04:53:38,710 --> 04:53:41,310
You'll never lay a finger on it.

3830
04:53:41,510 --> 04:53:42,510
Oh, thank you.

3831
04:53:51,940 --> 04:53:53,120
What's this?

3832
04:53:53,740 --> 04:53:54,840
A transmitter.

3833
04:53:57,400 --> 04:53:59,720
Who's responsible for this?

3834
04:54:01,820 --> 04:54:02,900
I am.

3835
04:54:04,560 --> 04:54:07,620
I planted it on him to keep track of his movements.

3836
04:54:08,680 --> 04:54:09,460
Ah!

3837
04:54:11,420 --> 04:54:11,860
Why?

3838
04:54:12,640 --> 04:54:14,920
He's going to smell it because it was on his body.

3839
04:54:15,880 --> 04:54:20,640
If they knew where he was going to be, they wouldn't have gotten themselves slaughtered.

3840
04:54:22,760 --> 04:54:32,580
It pains me to do this, boss, but under the circumstances, I'm afraid I must ask you to show me some proof that you and he were not in collusion.

3841
04:54:32,720 --> 04:54:33,580
You don't trust me.

3842
04:54:33,700 --> 04:54:34,220
Is that it?

3843
04:54:34,320 --> 04:54:35,040
Not that.

3844
04:54:35,740 --> 04:54:38,300
But he is your apprentice.

3845
04:54:39,480 --> 04:55:06,240
what do you want me to do i love him let's see i love all these stupid characters they're all so great cut out his eyes i don't like those blue eyes of his fast step for a big guy yeah he backed up fast you made him a soldier and now you will unmake him yes it'll make for a touching display

3846
04:55:09,740 --> 04:55:11,540
Do it!

3847
04:55:16,060 --> 04:55:18,780
Ruin him, just as he did the Cobras.

3848
04:55:31,690 --> 04:55:32,590
Oh,

3849
04:55:35,970 --> 04:55:36,870
sick!

3850
04:55:38,850 --> 04:55:40,750
He's such an asshole.

3851
04:55:42,710 --> 04:55:44,610
No, you need to watch.

3852
04:55:46,050 --> 04:55:46,370
Woman!

3853
04:55:55,070 --> 04:55:57,030
The other one, the other one!

3854
04:55:59,510 --> 04:55:59,960
Stop!

3855
04:56:01,270 --> 04:56:01,830
Stop!

3856
04:56:01,850 --> 04:56:03,950
What is it, Tanya?

3857
04:56:05,870 --> 04:56:06,710
He's suffered enough.

3858
04:56:07,930 --> 04:56:08,770
Well, well.

3859
04:56:11,210 --> 04:56:12,510
Why are you protecting him?

3860
04:56:13,910 --> 04:56:14,770
Well, well.

3861
04:56:15,270 --> 04:56:16,370
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

3862
04:56:18,730 --> 04:56:19,510
That smell.

3863
04:56:20,070 --> 04:56:21,170
That smelly smell.

3864
04:56:21,810 --> 04:56:23,250
That smelly smelly smells.

3865
04:56:24,410 --> 04:56:27,290
Tatiana, you're the spy.

3866
04:56:27,770 --> 04:56:28,630
I love this.

3867
04:56:28,670 --> 04:56:29,850
And, so right.

3868
04:56:32,790 --> 04:56:35,810
He's so, he's like an alien, trying to act human.

3869
04:56:35,810 --> 04:56:36,730
I know that smell.

3870
04:56:40,700 --> 04:56:41,140
Yeah.

3871
04:56:41,580 --> 04:56:41,920
Stop it.

3872
04:56:42,440 --> 04:56:44,920
Taking a fancy tour, eh, us a lot?

3873
04:56:46,780 --> 04:56:49,300
No, I have no interest in this woman.

3874
04:56:49,440 --> 04:56:49,660
In woman.

3875
04:56:50,340 --> 04:56:50,860
In women.

3876
04:56:51,520 --> 04:56:52,780
I want to test her.

3877
04:56:52,900 --> 04:56:54,400
He has no interest in women.

3878
04:56:57,680 --> 04:56:58,920
Bro is a weirdo.

3879
04:56:59,220 --> 04:57:00,780
He's like, I'll let this be the judge.

3880
04:57:01,040 --> 04:57:01,940
He's so weird.

3881
04:57:01,960 --> 04:57:02,620
Do as you like.

3882
04:57:05,040 --> 04:57:07,600
He's just the weirdest guy ever.

3883
04:57:07,840 --> 04:57:08,600
Here we go.

3884
04:57:11,820 --> 04:57:13,700
You smell like crock.

3885
04:57:22,900 --> 04:57:23,800
Yeah!

3886
04:57:33,710 --> 04:57:35,030
The double slap.

3887
04:57:36,770 --> 04:57:36,770
There.

3888
04:57:37,210 --> 04:57:38,870
Satisfied now.

3889
04:57:41,650 --> 04:57:42,790
Well, that was refreshing.

3890
04:57:43,270 --> 04:57:44,210
That's a red cheek.

3891
04:57:45,350 --> 04:57:47,210
Come, we're going to my room.

3892
04:58:05,320 --> 04:58:08,340
So you survived the colonel's torture, eh?

3893
04:58:15,280 --> 04:58:17,680
Watching this has made me realize something.

3894
04:58:17,880 --> 04:58:19,340
I'm really into torture.

3895
04:58:20,600 --> 04:58:21,860
It's really not that bad.

3896
04:58:24,320 --> 04:58:26,180
It's the ultimate form of expression.

3897
04:58:27,120 --> 04:58:28,420
Yeah, bite his finger off.

3898
04:58:31,240 --> 04:58:33,820
Oh, he is so great.

3899
04:58:35,620 --> 04:58:37,500
You got lucky this time, Ty.

3900
04:58:37,520 --> 04:58:37,980
Tatiana.

3901
04:58:49,440 --> 04:58:50,160
Send them away.

3902
04:59:02,580 --> 04:59:04,160
Boss, what are you doing, boss?

3903
04:59:04,760 --> 04:59:05,300
Oh,

3904
04:59:08,360 --> 04:59:09,620
God, that...

3905
04:59:11,820 --> 04:59:14,800
One, four, four, one, four, four, seven, five.

3906
04:59:18,600 --> 04:59:19,700
Am I lying?

3907
04:59:22,040 --> 04:59:23,940
One, forty-four, nine, seven, five.

3908
04:59:32,020 --> 04:59:33,920
I've prepared an escape route for us.

3909
04:59:34,440 --> 04:59:35,340
Go out and head west.

3910
04:59:35,960 --> 04:59:36,420
Okay.

3911
04:59:36,860 --> 04:59:39,300
Pass underneath the connecting passageway and go north.

3912
04:59:39,820 --> 04:59:41,280
You'll find an open manhole there.

3913
04:59:41,900 --> 04:59:42,660
You're quiet.

3914
04:59:45,320 --> 04:59:46,660
No, I'm not quiet.

3915
04:59:47,060 --> 04:59:47,440
I'm evil.

3916
04:59:47,940 --> 04:59:50,220
The door at the north end of the sewers is unlocked.

3917
04:59:50,620 --> 04:59:52,340
You can use it to get outside the fortress.

3918
04:59:53,320 --> 04:59:54,300
I've got your equipment.

3919
04:59:55,220 --> 04:59:56,080
We'll meet up later.

3920
04:59:56,260 --> 04:59:56,680

3937
05:01:02,970 --> 05:01:03,010
Okay.

3938
05:01:05,170 --> 05:01:06,730
Ready to save, Snake?

3939
05:01:10,410 --> 05:01:11,050
Johnny.

3940
05:01:13,270 --> 05:01:13,910
Snake?

3941
05:01:14,930 --> 05:01:15,870
My mouth hurts.

3942
05:01:16,010 --> 05:01:47,270
I talk poor god did you get cut up it feels like someone shoved me under a lawn why did she say it like that do me a favor tell me a story to take my mind off the pain snake have you ever heard of Renfield is that a movie it's the name of a character he's locked up in a cell waiting for the master to return eating the spiders that crawl along the walls change the channel he waits and waits for ages finally just as he's beginning to forget whether he's human or not The master comes for him,

3943
05:01:47,390 --> 05:01:48,750
saying the time has come.

3944
05:01:49,350 --> 05:01:50,690
Renfield is overjoyed.

3945
05:01:50,790 --> 05:01:52,250
Wait, isn't this?

3946
05:01:52,450 --> 05:01:56,070
The master spreads his huge wings, and a gust of wind fills the cell.

3947
05:01:56,430 --> 05:01:58,450
Come on, I don't want to hear this.

3948
05:01:58,830 --> 05:02:01,970
And there, standing before Renfield in human form, was...

3949
05:02:01,970 --> 05:02:02,430
Dracula.

3950
05:02:03,490 --> 05:02:03,950
Exactly!

3951
05:02:04,850 --> 05:02:08,830
If you stay there too long, your old buddy Dracula is going to come and get you too.

3952
05:02:09,290 --> 05:02:11,130
So you better start thinking of a way out of there.

3953
05:02:12,610 --> 05:02:14,930
You better not leave me without someone to talk to.

3954
05:02:16,770 --> 05:02:35,890

Um, so yeah, next time we'll finish the game.

3968
05:03:49,580 --> 05:03:51,060

So we'll do all of that.

3971
05:03:58,280 --> 05:04:03,500
I guess, uh, I do want to play sooner rather than later, but maybe I'll stick to Metal Gear Saturdays.

3972
05:04:06,660 --> 05:04:09,700
Maybe out just for the sake of my own nostalgia.

3973
05:04:21,430 --> 05:04:23,230
Good night, good night, good night!

3974
05:04:25,230 --> 05:04:27,430
This game is so fun!

3975
05:04:30,230 --> 05:04:37,730
It's really crazy seeing all these scenes in such high def and everything.

3976
05:04:38,070 --> 05:04:39,710
It's so crazy to me.

3977
05:04:43,380 --> 05:04:43,940
But...

3978
05:04:43,940 --> 05:04:44,100
Oh.

3979
05:04:44,880 --> 05:04:46,420
Should we one last snake eater?

3980
05:04:46,920 --> 05:04:48,380
Nah, it's okay, we'll just do it at the beginning.

3981
05:04:48,860 --> 05:04:49,860
There we go, thanks for the pig!

And next time, too, the eye patch returns.

3985
05:04:59,340 --> 05:05:00,820
Finally, I can wear it again.
