1
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
Hello.

2
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,260
Hello.

3
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,820
Hello.

4
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,200
God mind.

5
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,860
Guys...

6
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,840
I woke up and my throat hurt.

7
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,940
Oh gosh.

8
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,500
Made turquoise?

9
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,460
Loves this more than made mint?

10
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,750
Who is that?

11
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,170
I'll be one year away from 30 this Sunday.

12
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:54,910
Am I old?

13
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,310
Because I feel old and brittle.

14
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,430
You're not old until you're old and cranky.

15
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,830
Probably.

16
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,570
Do you feel like telling kids to get off your lawn?

17
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,510
Todd Bell!

18
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,110
He's really gifted.

19
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,490
There's a weird ghost on the TV.

20
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,970
So Minto old?

21
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,190
Are you saying I'm cranky?

22
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,530
Are you saying I'm cranky?

23
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,150
It's okay, Barn.

24
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:25,830
Thank you.

25
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,130
Ghost only Pokemon run.

26
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,650
Scarlet Violet is your best bet.

27
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,690
Open world?

28
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,550
You have access to most of the ghosts from the start.

29
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,170
NPC even trades you a Gengar early on?

30
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,130
Also, do you guys like me being in a box?

31
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,430
I figured it's better than me floating in the void.

32
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,230
But also, I'm not covering up so much.

33
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:55,610
Maybe.

34
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,370
I might have to reduce my head a little bit.

35
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,710
I'm the box ghost.

36
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,750
I'm the box ghost.

37
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,870
I'm the box ghost.

38
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,810
Just a box.

39
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,860
Just a box.

40
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,040
I'm eating a cough drop.

41
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:27,800
And I forgot to eat breakfast, so we might talk for a little bit and listen to whatever this ambiance is until it's time for me to start.

42
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,260
For breakfast, I have an egg.

43
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,420
I have an egg that I must peel.

44
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,840
They have an egg peeling instructions.

45
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,040
Congrats on 215,000!

46
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,580
Thank you!

47
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,900
Did you know that your eyes in CB form kind of look like acorns?

48
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,350
Hot dog?

49
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,170
No, Murphy.

50
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,330
I don't have any hot dogs.

51
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,330
But I also have a onigiri.

52
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,790
But it's like a healthy onigiri.

53
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,290
With barley and edamame and salted kelp.

54
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,770
They do look like acorns.

55
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,990
You're not gonna crack me open, are you?

56
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,710
Ghost containment box.

57
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:30,830
No, no, no.

58
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,850
This is not for my...this is not for my safety.

59
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,630
It's for yours.

60
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,430
Hold on, my...

61
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,210
I don't know what's...oh, it's because I moved my...okay.

62
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,410
I moved some stuff around on my desk and I'm not feeling it.

63
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,430
But, you know, we'll see.

64
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,750
I also...it has occurred to me that I'm playing a horror game.

65
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,530
Usually I have to kind of like psych myself up for these.

66
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,470
And here I go, just going in raw.

67
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,070
Like a dog.

68
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,570
JPEG dog was very happy with your achievement.

69
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,020
I got that dog in it.

70
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,380
I got that dog in me.

71
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,580
Been to that Lawson.

72
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,740
Oh, see that Lawson is doing a collab with Blue Archive.

73
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,580
I did!

74
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,120
I did.

75
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,960
I did see that.

76
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,500
But the merch that I do want from the Blue Archive Lawson...oh my gosh.

77
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,360
Please, Discord.

78
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,200
Why don't...why does...

79
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,780
Why does streamer mode not work for you?

80
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,980
I'm literally streaming.

81
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,650
Is it Mata?

82
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,970
No, this time it's Barry.

83
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,750
She's doing this GTA RP thing.

84
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,110
And I'm actually in the server.

85
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,730
But I didn't realize that it would be starting when I was in Japan.

86
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,970
So I don't think I can join.

87
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,190
Let's go!

88
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,310
Let's go!

89
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,230
Next season, maybe.

90
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:32,690
But I'm also...I was like...I don't know if I...why does it not work though?

91
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,590
For real.

92
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,630
She's showing me an oil rig.

93
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,930
Hold on, I'm just gonna close out of Discord.

94
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,710
Sorry Barry, I'll respond to you later.

95
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,130
Um...I'm getting paranoid with every ping.

96
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,290
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

97
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,670
What was I saying though?

98
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,150
Heard her talking about it earlier, wondering if you were gonna join.

99
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,850
Yeah, I uh...

100
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,600
I uh...wanted to.

101
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,460
But also, I'm like...so...I kinda...earlier, right before stream, I joined a...they were all in call.

102
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,660
And I joined, but I literally couldn't say anything.

103
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,700
I was like...

104
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,700
Okay, I'm following these instructions on how to peel this egg, and it is not...

105
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,280
working.

106
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,420
This is not the run.

107
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,080
This is...

108
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,500
I'm literally going...I'm having to go like...little piece by piece.

109
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,120
I don't remember what I was saying though.

110
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,480
Oh!

111
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,000
The Blue Archive Lawson.

112
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,440
Yes, I saw it, but...oh my gosh.

113
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,800
There are plushies that I really want.

114
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,160
I really want the Hina plushie.

115
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,160
But it's online order only.

116
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,320
The other stuff I'm okay with.

117
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll probably still get something.

118
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,740
Just cause I want to be like...I got Blue Archive.

119
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,540
The shell is full of calcium.

120
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,420
Don't lie to me.

121
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,980
I'm gullible.

122
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,040
You need instructions to peel an egg?

123
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,920
Well, I was trying to see if there was an optimal way of peeling.

124
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,960
And it said like, crack the top and the bottom, and then it will split down the middle.

125
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,660
That did not happen.

126
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:32,820
Okay.

127
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,250
Oh my god.

128
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,750
Depends on the boiled egg too?

129
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,670
Or maybe...

130
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,910
I'm like halfway there.

131
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,750
Kinda.

132
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,230
Stopping by quickly cause I'm currently on route to New York City!

133
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,970
So many people are going to New York!

134
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,370
So excited to see you in concert!

135
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,850
Gonna be at Breaking Dimensions too.

136
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,090
I'll be sure to cheer Wawa and Fumoko for you boss.

137
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:03,770
Yeah!

138
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:04,750
Thank you!

139
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,350
Hello ghost lady.

140
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:07,910
Hello, hello!

141
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,870
Supplementary streamlabs because Berry stomped on my birthday streamlabs with her discord pics!

142
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,110
Oh!

143
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:15,750
I'm sorry!

144
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,350
Oh my god.

145
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,210
Magic Sword King!

146
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:22,950
Happy Birthday!

147
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,230
If you're streaming on Saturday...

148
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,910
You can ignore this.

149
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:30,750
I'm...well...maybe...

150
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,030
No.

151
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,950
I don't...I might be streaming Saturday...your time.

152
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,130
No.

153
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,550
Actually I'm not sure.

154
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,510
Maybe...actually I can't...I don't know my schedule yet actually.

155
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,110
But happy birthday!

156
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,230
You know I was just thinking now just in case.

157
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,490
You know?

158
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,190
Because I got the concert...

159
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,390
And I have some other things planned that I gotta go do.

160
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,830
So...uh...it's like...time zones are confusing the heck out of me.

161
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,350
They're confusing the heck out of me.

162
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,570
Anyway, let me sing for you.

163
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,730
Oh!

164
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,290
Don't drop my egg!

165
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,570
Don't drop my egg!

166
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,090
Happy Birthday to you!

167
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,230
Happy Birthday to you!

168
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,870
Happy Birthday Magic Sword King!

169
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,650
And also Hideo Kojima!

170
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,070
Happy Birthday to you!

171
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,130
Happy Birthday to you!

172
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,590
I didn't know Kojima's birthday was on Saturday!

173
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:36,890
Wow!

174
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,590
And you share...do you share a little bit of his genius?

175
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,950
Mmm!

176
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,430
Eggie!

177
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:56,940
Mwah!

178
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,360
Mwah!

179
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,520
His dreams...

180
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,860
Does he know welcome to membership?

181
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,420
Sorry, if you're just coming in, I'm eating my breakfast first.

182
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,280
And then we'll start the game.

183
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:18,200
What you should have done is make a small hole at the top of the egg, bigger hole at the bottom, then blow through the top and shoot it out?

184
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,700
Wait, really?

185
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,180
But if you shoot it out, how do you catch it?

186
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,860
Where would it go?

187
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,280
How far would it shoot?

188
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,340
Does not work.

189
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,060
But does work.

190
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,490
I don't think that works on a hard boiler.

191
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:43,530
I don't think that works on a hard boiler.

192
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,010
Oh.

193
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,790
Enjoy your meal.

194
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,210
Have you heard of the horror genre convention called...

195
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,050
SAWCON?

196
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,430
Yeah!

197
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,530
I'm a guest every year, didn't you know?

198
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,770
I'm like the SAWCON representative.

199
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,730
I'm like the SAWCON representative.

200
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,070
I'm like the SAWCON representative.

201
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,010
What is that profile picture?

202
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,130
What is that profile picture?

203
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:09,390
Who changed it?

204
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,290
Who changed it?

205
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:14,690
I'm here.

206
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,750
Where am I?

207
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,450
I took the weekend off.

208
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,570
Work, wait.

209
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,690
Weekend off, work for the two concerts.

210
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,630
Let's go!

211
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,350
And glued to my bed for the rest of the evening watching the stream because the trip was a lot longer than I expected.

212
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,490
Okay, I think I'm good with the egg just for now.

213
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,170
Oh my gosh.

214
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,570
I got these other things at 7-Eleven.

215
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,530
And it's like... it's called... it's like baked chocolate.

216
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,710
And then it's also strawberry and blueberry flavored.

217
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,250
And it is... oh my gosh.

218
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,230
It is some of the... oh my god, it is so...

219
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,490
It's way better than... I was like, baked chocolate?

220
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,930
Like... that's... that's interesting.

221
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:05,950
I've never heard of that.

222
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,310
Like... you know?

223
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,910
But it tastes like a brownie.

224
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,370
It is the... oh my gosh.

225
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,490
Before I leave, I'm going to be buying like 50 of these.

226
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,730
Because they're so good!

227
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,870
Can someone update me if Mint got her wallet yet?

228
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,330
I did!

229
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,010
Yeah, I did!

230
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,930
I got it on Monday.

231
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,990
But yeah, I was just like, I wonder what a baked chocolate tastes like.

232
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,030
I'm gonna eat it right now.

233
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:31,730
I don't know.

234
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,610
It's so good.

235
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,860
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

236
00:15:50,980 --> 00:16:02,080
So if you... go to Japan or in Japan, and you go to 7-Eleven, get the baked chocolate.

237
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,660
Chocolate.

238
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,800
It's baked.

239
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,640
Yeah.

240
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,300
I mean...

241
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,580
Unrelated, but there's this omelette that...

242
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,200
this one restaurant I go to makes.

243
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,480
And it's got a runny egg in the middle.

244
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,180
And I've tried to replicate it, but it never turns out.

245
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,440
I don't... I don't care how they do it.

246
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,360
Like a French toast?

247
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,360
Chocolate buns.

248
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,160
Thank you!

249
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,500
Hashtag not sponsored.

250
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,760
Yeah, hashtag not sponsored.

251
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,420
It was... it's just that delicious.

252
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,900
And they're like small enough that like...

253
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,220
I can eat one...

254
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,820
and feel fine, you know?

255
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,540
And not feel bad.

256
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,420
But I also only need to eat one.

257
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,680
I've been like munching on them the past week.

258
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,100
I just have one a day.

259
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,620
How many do I have left in here?

260
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,180
Only three!

261
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,540
Uh oh.

262
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,880
I'm gonna have to go get some more.

263
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,400
I want some more.

264
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,000
Okay, let me take a sippy of my tea.

265
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,760
Why would you feel bad?

266
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,480
You know what?

267
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,060
You can never eat like...

268
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,740
too many chocolates and feel bad.

269
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,640
Yeah, Isamori is talking about Sakon like it's a real thing.

270
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,710
No, I don't mean like tummy whore.

271
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,610
I mean like guilty.

272
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,250
Like you're just like, oh no.

273
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,610
I should have never eaten all of those.

274
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:35,830
Oh no.

275
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,930
Like bad physically or mentally?

276
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,110
Mentally, mentally, mentally.

277
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,690
Not bad physically.

278
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,350
Okay.

279
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,380
Spooky and scary.

280
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,500
Why is this game so dark?

281
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
Okay, my brightness is all the way up.

282
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,940
And it's still so dark.

283
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,220
Brownie finds thank you!

284
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,960
It's completely cooked.

285
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,180
But then you cut into it and it's a delicious runny egg.

286
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,640
They serve it on French bread.

287
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,280
This is not French toast!

288
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,720
It's my favorite thing outside the Rum Chata French...

289
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,620
Oh my god.

290
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,240
That's my wake up alarm.

291
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,080
Alright.

292
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,980
So, where did we last leave off?

293
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,200
We were starting night...

294
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,860
Oh gosh, I'm gonna have to remember how to play the game.

295
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,560
Alright, let's just continue.

296
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Starting day three.

297
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,560
The frightening.

298
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,440
I don't know how...

299
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,920
I am going to try and finish the game today.

300
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,620
So...

301
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,620
You know.

302
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,420
Might be a little bit longer of a stream.

303
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,860
French toast is very different.

304
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,940
F to reload the flashlight.

305
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,040
Oh yes!

306
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,280
We're gonna go...

307
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,380
Yes, we just woke up.

308
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,780
We're gonna go find mom.

309
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,280
Why can't I pet the cat?

310
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,560
There we go.

311
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,600
This window is also boarded up.

312
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,920
Thanks Springtrap.

313
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,460
Hammered shut.

314
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,960
So I guess for this last night...

315
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,380
We will have to...

316
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:16,900
Oh my god.

317
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,100
Already followed that thing once.

318
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,620
Didn't go so well last time.

319
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,080
My favorite chocolate that I only sell seasonal and I'm super sad.

320
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,780
I'm a Cadbury egg addict.

321
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,720
That's the stuff with like the cream in the middle, right?

322
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,940
What if I do follow him?

323
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,540
Oh, not falling for that again.

324
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,120
Better go the long way around.

325
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:41,540
Okay.

326
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,280
But then...

327
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,500
Okay.

328
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,380
Let's do a little bit of a recap.

329
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,880
We go into a pit.

330
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,180
First of all, we are Oswald.

331
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,280
And we're just some kid that like...

332
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,120
Is kind of ungrateful sometimes.

333
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,940
But he's growing on me.

334
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,980
He's growing on me a little bit.

335
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,880
He just has bad opinions, I think.

336
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:04,980
And...

337
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,180
He...

338
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,020
Um...

339
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,600
Went to a pizza place.

340
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,520
His dad dropped him off.

341
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,560
And then he went into the armpit.

342
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,320
And traveled through time.

343
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,080
Oh, great mid of the turquoise box.

344
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,040
What is your wisdom?

345
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,020
Turquoise and mint are closer colors than I thought.

346
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,820
Sorry, the ball pit.

347
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,760
Sorry, the ball pit.

348
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,720
The ball pit, not the armpit.

349
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,940
He went into the ball pit.

350
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,020
And traveled through time.

351
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,000
And he became...

352
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,160
He became really loyal to some kids he just met like...

353
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,640
For two minutes.

354
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,400
And so we've been going back and forth through time.

355
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,360
Um...

356
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,380
Because also our dad got pulled into the ball pit by Springtrap.

357
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,700
And we're searching for him.

358
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,300
And Springtrap has replaced our dad in the present.

359
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,740
And so...

360
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,820
Yeah.

361
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,100
That's about it.

362
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,620
Basically it.

363
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,980
And our Springtrap as our...

364
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,340
Oh, wait.

365
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:06,560
Sorry.

366
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,520
I just noticed the notifs like are kind of cut off.

367
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,240
Um...

368
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,760
He like sits with us at dinner.

369
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,740
And it's really funny.

370
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,500
I like that part.

371
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,660
Mom!

372
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,420
Do all ball pits take you through time?

373
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,600
Possibly.

374
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,500
Ew!

375
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,320
Dad's underwear!

376
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,480
Alright.

377
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,800
I wonder if you do this enough times if Uboa shows up.

378
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,620
Oh!

379
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,040
Flick the light switch ten times.

380
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,440
I'm super mega excited about the concert.

381
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,680
Sunday!

382
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,040
I'm gonna jam my heart out.

383
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,800
Yeah!

384
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,320
Thank you!

385
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,720
Anything in here?

386
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,700
I'm looking for flashlight batteries at the moment.

387
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,480
Grandma holding me as a baby.

388
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,360
Flashlight batteries.

389
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,180
Flashlight batteries.

390
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:57,980
Nothing in here.

391
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,220
Okay.

392
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,800
What concert?

393
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,160
I'll be performing at a concert in New York at ANYC.

394
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,700
Um...

395
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,700
This weekend?

396
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,360
I'm kinda curious about FNAF lore.

397
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,840
You should watch that one nine-hour FNAF lore video some guy did.

398
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,000
Maybe make it a watch-along.

399
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,800
Oh my god.

400
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,200
Um...

401
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,700
Scrubs.

402
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,300
Minto is grounded!

403
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,100
We had that light switch installed for you.

404
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,740
So you could turn the lights on and off.

405
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,760
Not so you could throw light switch waves.

406
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,140
If that thing stood here, would it be...

407
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,800
a rabbit in the reflection or my dad?

408
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,540
Oh.

409
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,380
We haven't seen that dialogue yet.

410
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,980
Oh, mom!

411
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,800
He said take the long way, but this is...

412
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,840
Wouldn't the other way be the long way?

413
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,700
Good morning, Oswald.

414
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,700
Are you ready for breakfast?

415
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,920
I think I'll just eat at school today, if that's okay.

416
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,480
Sure, honey.

417
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,180
Have you made any new friends yet?

418
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,660
Well, there is this one new guy.

419
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,480
I can't seem to get away from.

420
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,340
Springtrap?

421
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:12,780
Um...

422
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,160
Do I need to turn the brightness up a little bit?

423
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,240
Just let me know.

424
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,940
Now, Os.

425
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,280
That's not very nice.

426
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,120
Maybe he wants to be your friend.

427
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:22,920
Eh...

428
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,980
In any case, it's only your second day.

429
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,880
It'll get better.

430
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,880
You just have to take it one step at a time.

431
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,000
Go to school.

432
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,440
Found the battery!

433
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:36,980
Nice!

434
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,020
Nice.

435
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,960
This is why we...

436
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,420
This is why we run around.

437
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,400
I made a chocolate.

438
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,680
I've been making this chocolate cake with...

439
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,780
Raspberry mousse layers!

440
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,220
Buttercrack frost egg with a white chocolate...

441
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,520
Stop!

442
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,100
It sounds so good.

443
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,620
Why is it so dark in here?

444
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,200
Oh my gosh.

445
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:52,500
Okay.

446
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,040
I think I actually have to turn up the setting.

447
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,840
Maybe it...

448
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,300
Maybe like that.

449
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,760
So that it's easier to...

450
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,500
It's still so dark!

451
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,860
Not allowed to mess with the toolbox.

452
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,400
Furnace down here was the scariest.

453
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:18,920
We got rats.

454
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,060
It's still so dark.

455
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,100
Oh my god.

456
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,940
That rat scared me.

457
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,250
Anything in here?

458
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,050
It's worse?

459
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,050
I think so.

460
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,490
I tried to change the color contrast.

461
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,750
Because otherwise it's just like...

462
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,430
Like if you have the contrast with the brightness...

463
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,430
It should be better, right?

464
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,830
I don't know.

465
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,410
Anyway.

466
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,510
We'll see how it is later.

467
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:57,650
Cat.

468
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,970
Let's check if I'm being a little loot goblin.

469
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:01,250
Sorry.

470
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,370
Ruth Beerslayer!

471
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:03,830
Thanks.

472
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,650
Welcome to membership.

473
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,350
Thank you.

474
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,030
Oh!

475
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,550
Jeff's number.

476
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:07,990
Wait.

477
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,770
Other than the pizzeria's phone number...

478
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,530
The notes are gibberish.

479
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,570
Wait.

480
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,010
What was it?

481
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,670
5-5-5-5-3-3-3.

482
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:16,470
Do I need that?

483
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,830
Springtrap.

484
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,510
Are you sitting at the dinner table?

485
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:21,930
No!

486
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,890
Where are you?

487
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,390
Is he going to ambush me?

488
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,730
The board games.

489
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,070
The year.

490
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,110
Calendar year.

491
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,990
Jinx likes to perch up there and watch over us while we eat.

492
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,670
Cute.

493
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,430
I used to have a cat that would sit with us at the dinner table.

494
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,850
He would like not climb on the table.

495
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,970
He would sit in the chair and just kind of like stare at us.

496
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,050
He never tried to get on the table either.

497
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,930
He was very polite.

498
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,130
I think she's just hoping we'll drop a scrap she can snack on.

499
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,530
But what's the year?

500
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,750
Can I go in here?

501
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,010
Oh!

502
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,190
Okay.

503
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,390
Springtrap is gone, I guess.

504
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,170
Trying to find...

505
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,310
Why do we have so many boxes?

506
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,990
Did we just move?

507
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:11,750
Are we moving?

508
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,090
What the?

509
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,710
Did you?

510
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,170
What the?

511
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:18,590
Huh?

512
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,290
The Freddy head!

513
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,730
More.

514
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,430
More.

515
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:32,970
More.

516
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,210
More.

517
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:33,710
Wait.

518
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,450
Is it still down there?

519
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,840
It is!

520
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,880
What?

521
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,800
Freddy mask.

522
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,260
Why would anyone want to look at this thing?

523
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,300
Tradable item.

524
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,080
Oh!

525
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,600
Oh!

526
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,880
Tradable.

527
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,660
Do I give this to the kid?

528
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,460
That wants something unique?

529
00:26:59,320 --> 00:26:59,880
Interesting.

530
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,350
No!

531
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:08,910
What?

532
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,950
What is this?

533
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,890
Yeah, the fireworks guy, maybe.

534
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,390
Oh!

535
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:21,890
Hi, Dad!

536
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:22,830
Oh!

537
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,350
Hi, Dad!

538
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,270
I like how his eyes stop glowing when he...

539
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,550
Oh!

540
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,730
When she's not looking.

541
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,730
You might be a big sixth grader now, but you can't outrun a mom smooch.

542
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,140
Be good today, Oswald.

543
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,760
Remember that Dad and I are always here for you.

544
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,840
Aw, Spartan!

545
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,440
Welcome to the membership.

546
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:44,900
Thank you.

547
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,820
What about my dad's smooch?

548
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,680
Oh, sorry.

549
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,480
I can move now.

550
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,960
Dad, are you going to smooch me too?

551
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,260
Dad, please, give me a hug, Dad.

552
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,120
It's been so long since you...

553
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,280
I'm like sneaking past him.

554
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:05,880
Glow.

555
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,140
That's so funny.

556
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,320
When he looks at the mom, his eyes stop glowing.

557
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:11,780
Okay.

558
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,100
I'm phasing through him.

559
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,340
I wonder if we're ever going to visit Grandma.

560
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,140
We talk about her several times.

561
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,600
It's the only reason we're here, apparently.

562
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,240
So...

563
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,900
I wish you would believe me about Dad.

564
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,880
Okay.

565
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,600
Go to school.

566
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,350
What if the mom likes the dad like this, though?

567
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,410
What if she's like...

568
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,770
He's changed, but for like the better.

569
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,870
Oh my god.

570
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,300
She's freaky.

571
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,320
She's freaky like that.

572
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,340
Okay.

573
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,460
Let's go, let's go.

574
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,860
It's Oswald the Ocelot.

575
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,680
Looking for a place to...

576
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,100
To molt?

577
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,820
I don't...

578
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,640
Do you know what an ocelot is?

579
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,540
Huh?

580
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,850
I love Oswald the Ocelot.

581
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,530
Wait.

582
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,860
What the...

583
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,120
What do you mean, molt?

584
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,620
I'm not like a bug.

585
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,500
Ocelots don't even do that, Dylan.

586
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,160
I guess you'd be the expert.

587
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,080
And what's so bad about being an ocelot?

588
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,020
They're prideful creatures!

589
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,600
Ocelots are like, great!

590
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,640
I've got way bigger problems than you...

591
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,040
...than you today.

592
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,960
Oh my god!

593
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,980
He just slapped my butt!

594
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,720
What the heck

595
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,040
was that?

596
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,560
Oh my god, I'm starting to have hallucinations.

597
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,640
What's the matter, Oswald?

598
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,300
Nothing misses me, champ.

599
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,020
I just can't focus, I guess.

600
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,200
We're starting to have hallucinations...

601
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,640
Oh my gosh, we're starting to get really...

602
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,400
...really into the...

603
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,960
...the time travel.

604
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,080
Maybe you need to stretch your legs to clear your mind.

605
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,940
I left a book behind in the principal's office.

606
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,420
Would you mind getting it for me?

607
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,240
Get Mrs. MeChamp's book from the principal's office.

608
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,280
Why do I think we're going to be traveled back in time?

609
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,140
Why do I think something spooky is going to happen?

610
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,960
Don't make me go, Mrs. MeChamp!

611
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
Don't make me go!

612
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,320
I just want to learn my ABCs!

613
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,940
Also, why...

614
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,000
Okay, I know she's...

615
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,480
We're in sixth grade, right?

616
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,980
Why is this, like, room look like it's for kindergartners?

617
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,160
Only four kids in a class?

618
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,420
It's a small town, you know?

619
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,140
How can I save Dad if I can barely even get through school?

620
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,280
Derek played!

621
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,400
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

622
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,060
Come on, Oz.

623
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,060
Like Mom said, one step at a time.

624
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,920
I'm going to take a step and I'm going to get transported into the spooky world!

625
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:43,780
Okay.

626
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,060
Two steps.

627
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,460
Three steps.

628
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,560
Four steps.

629
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,080
Five steps.

630
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,400
Step, step.

631
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,700
Where is the principal's office?

632
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,940
I need to get the book from the...

633
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,460
Oh, here we go.

634
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,860
Dylan effed around and got found out.

635
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,420
Yeah, what a dummy.

636
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,740
A battery!

637
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,120
Oh!

638
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,660
Thank goodness.

639
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,100
Okay.

640
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,080
It pays being a loot demon.

641
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,420
Oh my gosh.

642
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,320
Get out of my stream, Matara-Khan!

643
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,900
You are just a problem to me in my everyday afterlife, aren't you?

644
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,600
What if I pulled that, though?

645
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,920
Battery, battery...

646
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,170
Hey, what are you doing outside of class?

647
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,710
I'm getting a book for Mrs. Maychamp.

648
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,430
Matara, please.

649
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,130
Wait, actually, can I turn these off?

650
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,110
How do I turn off the things for...

651
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,770
Hold on.

652
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,370
How do I turn this off, actually?

653
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,300
Settings?

654
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,080
Notifications?

655
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,120
What's a toast?

656
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,960
Show toast?

657
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,620
Maybe that's it.

658
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,320
Maybe I did it.

659
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,280
Okay.

660
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,520
Maybe I did it.

661
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,340
I think.

662
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,630
There we go.

663
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:17,330
I think I did it.

664
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,570
It says toast on the steam.

665
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,130
This calls it a toast.

666
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,110
Anyway.

667
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,430
I'm getting a book.

668
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,670
No, you're not, kid.

669
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,790
You're helping me find the key to my office.

670
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,110
Oh.

671
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,150
Oh my god.

672
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,490
It's one of those, like, fetch quests.

673
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:35,450
Huh?

674
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,570
I got locked out of my office when I went to get a snake?

675
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,650
A what?

676
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,390
Get a what?

677
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,130
A snack.

678
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,910
I went to get a...

679
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,130
Huh?

680
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,810
What is she implying here?

681
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,130
Oh, a snack!

682
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,840
When I went to oversee student behavior.

683
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,940
I'll look around.

684
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,940
You're a lifesaver, little guy.

685
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,160
Okay.

686
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,000
Let's go find some keys.

687
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,340
Find the principal's keys.

688
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,320
Are they in this locker?

689
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,400
These lockers don't get used.

690
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,760
Not enough kids to need them since the mill closed.

691
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,140
What's in here?

692
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,020
This door is locked.

693
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:27,880
What is this?

694
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,200
Oh, the playground.

695
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:29,720
Okay.

696
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,500
Let's go check one of the classrooms.

697
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,840
Perhaps this one over here?

698
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,040
Perhaps if I leave?

699
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,020
Can't leave the school.

700
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,180
We aren't even dismissed yet.

701
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,420
Come on, Oswald.

702
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,100
Be a rebel.

703
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,980
Don't be a rebel.

704
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,840
Don't you want to just be a rebel once in your life?

705
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,960
Well, there's no one in here.

706
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,920
Snake is a snack though.

707
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,700
So true.

708
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,040
Got him.

709
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,420
Okay.

710
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,620
Oh my gosh.

711
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,660
I don't know why that's like the...

712
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,440
Scares me so much.

713
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,240
Something spooky is going to happen at the school.

714
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,900
I know it.

715
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,820
I'm just waiting for it.

716
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,940
Run, Ozzy.

717
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,080
Run.

718
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:17,720
Whoa.

719
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,640
Where did you find it?

720
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,680
You know, I searched almost every room in the school for that key.

721
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,700
Ms. Principal, there's like two...

722
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,080
There's actually two rooms.

723
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,720
There's actually two rooms in this school.

724
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,980
Almost every room?

725
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,980
I better be off.

726
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,300
I think I heard someone calling for me in the cafeteria.

727
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,680
There's a cafeteria.

728
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,540
And she just lets me into her office with no...

729
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:45,780
Oh.

730
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:47,920
Okay.

731
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,860
Hold on.

732
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,540
Any batteries?

733
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,700
Framed articles from the school newspaper.

734
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,380
Headlines about the time we won a kickball tournament.

735
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,820
What else is in here?

736
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,260
Any batteries?

737
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:58,980
Any batteries?

738
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Any batteries?

739
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,040
I think that's the thing that I got whipped with earlier.

740
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,960
Dad would come for our parent teacher conferences.

741
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,580
Doubt that thing will come to those.

742
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,960
If I save you in the hospital, you can do it for me.

743
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,200
I squint, I can see my house from here.

744
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,400
Grab it.

745
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,780
Grab the thing.

746
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,960
Grab the little silly...

747
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,360
Grab the silly hand!

748
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,020
The gummy hand!

749
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,780
Loving the live mint reaction box.

750
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,220
Look, I didn't want to just be floating in mid-air, okay?

751
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,140
Finally.

752
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,500
Now I can get back to class.

753
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,800
Wait, what's that?

754
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,820
Oh, I got the stretchy hand.

755
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,780
That'll teach Dylan not to mess with me.

756
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,100
I got a stretchy hand.

757
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,440
I got a stretchy hand.

758
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,920
But if it's so distracting, I'll get rid of it.

759
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,440
You certainly took your time, Oswald.

760
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,460
Sorry, Mrs. Meacham.

761
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,920
I really needed that break.

762
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,240
Oh, you couldn't say that the principal needed help too?

763
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,140
Oswald's falling asleep.

764
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,160
I'll see you tomorrow, class.

765
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,680
Make sure you're writing your essays.

766
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,080
Where did all these children come from?

767
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,140
I think the second day of school was even harder than the first.

768
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,220
Huh?

769
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,440
Is it lunchtime yet?

770
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,040
Play anything good recently?

771
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,320
I just got this new horror game.

772
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,520
What's scary is how it'll rot your brain.

773
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,680
Oh, thanks, Mrs. Meacham.

774
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,320
Do you ever feel like there's something you have to do...

775
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,040
but you don't know...

776
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,720
if you have what it takes to do it?

777
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,300
Oh, Oswald.

778
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,160
I'm sure your essay will be great.

779
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,380
Chat, I love this.

780
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,340
Mint, should I delete it?

781
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,720
Shut up!

782
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,700
Oh, right.

783
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,300
Yeah, my essay.

784
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,020
Oh, gosh.

785
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,200
Kiss of Iodine.

786
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,760
Maybe I should make some coffee.

787
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,700
What do the kids got to say?

788
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,380
What are the...

789
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,740
What's up, my fellow...

790
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,300
Oh, my gosh, we're wearing, like, the same T-shirt.

791
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,900
Dylan keeps trying to jump out from behind the lockers to scare me.

792
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,420
How does he get behind there?

793
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,760
Can't scare me if I see it coming.

794
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,660
Right?

795
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,260
Why did that...

796
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,240
Oh, God!

797
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,700
Oh, my God.

798
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,360
I was gonna say, why did the door open by itself?

799
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,440
Like, it was beckoning me.

800
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
It was inviting me in.

801
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,740
Did you hear?

802
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,420
We're dissecting frogs tomorrow.

803
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,560
It'll be so gross.

804
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,320
But also so cool.

805
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,700
Bring Your Own Blood is such a fun game.

806
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,640
What?

807
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,820
It has super cool graphics and gameplay.

808
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,480
Bring Your Own Blood.

809
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,280
Okay.

810
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,120
Not frog, but...

811
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,480
Yeah, I'm getting dissected.

812
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,480
Yeah, I haven't been touched like that since...

813
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,260
1987.

814
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,500
Oh, 19...

815
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,120
Wait, what was that?

816
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,020
Nothing.

817
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,420
Oh, wait.

818
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,160
What was the first one?

819
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,960
The New Modern Encyclopedia Volume 3.

820
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,760
From 1965.

821
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,400
Wow, modern.

822
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,280
Old frog.

823
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,920
Yeah, but I know some new tricks.

824
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,440
The frog of 87.

825
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,620
Is he gonna pop out?

826
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,300
Outside of some smelly gym clothes?

827
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:52,740
Stop.

828
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,680
Dylan.

829
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,080
Dylan.

830
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,320
Dylan.

831
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,860
Oh, why are you in here?

832
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,240
They won't let me do my synchronized water balloon fight performance.

833
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,480
Oh, yeah.

834
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,420
Apparently, the school doesn't have the budget for that many water balloons.

835
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,880
No.

836
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,590
Ugh.

837
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,730
How many did you ask for?

838
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:23,950
2,000.

839
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,230
I really like the thin reddish line inside the box, too.

840
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,730
Is that serious?

841
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,790
Pirate 505?

842
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,990
I think there's a bit, but it's supposed to be brown.

843
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,550
It's not supposed to be red.

844
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,490
That does sound like a bit much.

845
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,990
Well, it was originally 4,000.

846
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,630
So, I thought I was cutting him a deal.

847
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,190
Okay.

848
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,210
Okay.

849
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,170
Let's see.

850
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,250
Look, she looks like she's gonna cry.

851
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,770
She looks so upset.

852
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:01,850
Oh, never mind.

853
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:02,830
She's over it.

854
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,610
She's over it, guys.

855
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,210
Anything else out here?

856
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,050
Some b-ball?

857
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,670
Shooting hoops now?

858
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:14,510
Come on.

859
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,860
There's nothing else in that backpack that I could use.

860
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,160
What about the water bottle?

861
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,700
What if Suzy from class three used it?

862
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,340
The water bottle?

863
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,040
Oh, that's a good one.

864
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,620
The volleyball team passed the preliminaries for the tournament.

865
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,040
Keep protecting your smile, your royal hotness.

866
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,320
What are you, Fuwamoka?

867
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,940
You're protecting my smile?

868
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,620
Nice.

869
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,260
Sounds like you guys really served up a win.

870
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,000
Stuffed stupid shark.

871
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,980
Thanks for the 5.50.

872
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:52,780
Haha.

873
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,740
And you really dished out a cheesy dad joke.

874
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,800
I learned from the best.

875
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,780
Okay.

876
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,380
Springtrap knows all the jokes.

877
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:03,780
Oh.

878
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,540
There's no bullies this time.

879
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,700
Oh my gosh.

880
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,300
This is cool.

881
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,220
Like, the windows are broken and everything.

882
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,120
Let's see.

883
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,700
Objective is to go home, but what if we go to the library?

884
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,520
Mr. McMayo, thanks for four months!

885
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,340
Has it really been like four months since I've come back?

886
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,120
Wait.

887
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,660
What is that?

888
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,640
Hold on.

889
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,260
There's something outside the window.

890
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:37,560
Hold on.

891
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,380
Never mind.

892
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,140
It was just a bird.

893
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,440
I was like, what is that?

894
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,160
What is that?

895
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:47,920
I was at the window.

896
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,660
It was just a bird.

897
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,460
My bad.

898
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,120
Can't go inside.

899
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,900
Can't go behind.

900
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,680
This game is like a little bit linear.

901
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:09,690
Any more questions?

902
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,590
Any more batteries?

903
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:15,210
Nope.

904
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:15,550
Okay.

905
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,430
Congrats on four months.

906
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:17,930
Thanks!

907
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:20,830
Linear is not bad.

908
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:21,330
No, no.

909
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,350
I'm not saying it in a bad way.

910
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:24,470
Okay.

911
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,030
Oh gosh.

912
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:25,910
Oh, you guys.

913
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,130
Tonight is gonna be...

914
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:27,570
Okay.

915
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,330
But after we get out tonight, with the...

916
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:36,030
Through the window, with the ladder, how else is there to get...

917
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,890
Why don't we just use the front door, Oswald?

918
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:38,610
All right.

919
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,510
I think there was a VTuber fan NPC in the school today.

920
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,770
Wait, really?

921
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:45,810
Oh, no!

922
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:46,750
Down at the pizzeria!

923
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,970
Hold on, hold on.

924
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,250
Four month Minto.

925
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:54,670
Crazy.

926
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:55,970
Let me out!

927
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,110
Let me leave!

928
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,240
In the school...

929
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,040
It isn't locked at night.

930
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:09,640
The door?

931
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,100
Yeah, but just unlock it from the inside.

932
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,740
Are you the VTuber fan?

933
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,360
Oh, the water balloon fight.

934
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,620
She looks so over it.

935
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,980
She looks so over it!

936
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,980
I think I talked with everybody, though.

937
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,520
I'm not gonna lie.

938
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:32,770
Dylan...

939
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,410
This guy...

940
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,210
Dissecting frogs...

941
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,330
This guy...

942
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,210
Bring your own blood...

943
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,750
The gamer student...

944
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,550
He sounds like he'd be a VTuber fan.

945
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:46,230
Wait!

946
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,970
There's a VTuber fan, though?

947
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:48,530
That's so funny.

948
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,190
I just realized what you said.

949
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,890
How do you know he's a VTuber fan?

950
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,390
Does he say?

951
00:44:58,410 --> 00:44:59,530
I like VTubers.

952
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,870
What about you?

953
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,560
I think I saw it.

954
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,880
There is, but he spawns randomly.

955
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,540
His name is VTuber fan!

956
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:16,720
Shut up.

957
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,320
He likes a certain shark girl.

958
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,980
Shut up!

959
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,260
No way.

960
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,460
Oops.

961
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,140
Oh!

962
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:25,620
Oh!

963
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,020
Oh!

964
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:26,400
Maybe him.

965
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:27,760
Oh.

966
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,900
Normally, I'm excited about leaving school and heading home.

967
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,360
Today, I'm dreading it.

968
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:32,600
Wait.

969
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,260
Hold on.

970
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,100
Oh, this is the science kid.

971
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,120
VTuber fan!

972
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,960
VTuber fan!

973
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,860
If you can hear me!

974
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,900
Say bow-wow!

975
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,980
Oh, what about you?

976
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,300
VTuber fan!

977
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:53,700
Nope.

978
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,080
Talking about Dylan.

979
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,260
If you are VTuber fan!

980
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,020
Say!

981
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,130
Why did I just get censored?

982
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,830
Fucking Patriots, man.

983
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,090
Him!

984
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:27,470
Him!

985
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:27,630
Him!

986
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:27,710
Him!

987
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:27,790
Him!

988
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:28,530
Oh, no.

989
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,690
It's the gamer student again.

990
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,260
Why is he talking about eating bugs?

991
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:36,800
Wait.

992
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,160
Who is she?

993
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,120
Hold on.

994
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:42,840
Okay.

995
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,740
I think I give up.

996
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,800
Oh, this is the volleyball girl.

997
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,220
That's right.

998
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,500
I like how kids just go into the principal's office.

999
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,680
Like, it's no big deal.

1000
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,220
Okay.

1001
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,400
I give up.

1002
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,220
I believe you, though.

1003
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,480
So, I believe that there is a VTuberFan in this school.

1004
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:03,940
Probably.

1005
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,160
Neil, you're the observant student.

1006
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,320
I don't think he's gonna show.

1007
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,180
One more try?

1008
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,600
Where could he be?

1009
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,740
Where could he be?

1010
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,120
1987?

1011
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,440
No, it's modern day!

1012
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,060
What are you talking about?

1013
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,980
Purple striped shirt.

1014
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,040
Okay, okay, okay.

1015
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,270
But those students, like, walk around in here.

1016
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,050
Go home, everybody!

1017
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:46,970
Go home!

1018
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,130
Went home to catch a stream?

1019
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:55,310
Oh well.

1020
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,220
This is science student, that's right.

1021
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,560
Yeah, the gross, but cool.

1022
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,360
Okay, let's go home.

1023
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,340
Guys, I'm scared!

1024
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,800
This one's gonna be hard.

1025
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,580
This one's gonna be hard, right?

1026
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,240
Oh gosh.

1027
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,680
This one's gonna be hard.

1028
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,120
Carrying a ladder makes a lot of noise!

1029
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,620
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1030
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,700
Looks like it's roaming the house again.

1031
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,540
Wait, roaming around the house again.

1032
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,580
Time to find a way out of here.

1033
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,360
Oh my god.

1034
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:40,720
Okay.

1035
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,580
It's all boarded up!

1036
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,600
It's all boarded up!

1037
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,720
Do my homework!

1038
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,140
My desk where I do my drawings.

1039
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,280
Too stressed out to sketch something right now.

1040
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,830
Has she tried the front door already?

1041
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:02,730
Have you tried the front door?

1042
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:06,230
No.

1043
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,890
Actually, I don't think I have.

1044
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:10,790
What is he gonna do?

1045
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,250
Hammer the front door shut?

1046
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:15,770
You can't.

1047
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:18,070
Oh my gosh.

1048
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:18,890
I can't read your name.

1049
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:19,970
But thank you for the vibe gifted!

1050
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,460
I hear him.

1051
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,460
I hear him.

1052
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:30,780
I hear him.

1053
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,340
What do I have in my inventory?

1054
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:38,700
No!

1055
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,180
My inventory is still glitched!

1056
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,400
No way!

1057
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,060
This is so messed up.

1058
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,440
My inventory is still glitched, you guys.

1059
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,080
It doesn't show me everything.

1060
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,000
Oh no!

1061
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,700
Sticky and gross just like Dylan.

1062
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:05,540
Um...

1063
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:10,830
How many...

1064
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:12,730
It doesn't say how many batteries I even have.

1065
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,390
I hope it's not just the one.

1066
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:16,930
Dad's wallet.

1067
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:20,150
All the wooden balls.

1068
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:21,930
Yeah, we got...

1069
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:22,850
Okay, we have a glass.

1070
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:23,390
Screwdriver!

1071
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,050
Kid in the basement.

1072
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,370
Screwdriver though!

1073
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,290
I don't think it will help us much.

1074
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,440
DM had the same problem?

1075
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,300
Like girl DM?

1076
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,060
Okay.

1077
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,300
I don't know where he went.

1078
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,000
I'm scared.

1079
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,960
I'm scared you guys!

1080
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,360
I don't hear anything though.

1081
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,760
The way he crawls out is so funny.

1082
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:04,760
I'm scared!

1083
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,520
I'm scared!

1084
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:05,860
I'm scared!

1085
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:15,970
I don't hear anything.

1086
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,030
Actually, I shouldn't have turned on the fan.

1087
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:21,990
It makes it hard to hear.

1088
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,940
I didn't hype myself up for a horror game!

1089
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,830
He doesn't come into my room though, does he?

1090
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:49,350
Don't think.

1091
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:50,530
Just do.

1092
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:51,130
Okay.

1093
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:51,910
Thanks.

1094
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:54,190
Thanks Maverick.

1095
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:57,770
Oh my god.

1096
00:51:58,930 --> 00:51:59,290
What?

1097
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,870
Why are the lights out?

1098
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,450
Oh my god!

1099
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:05,170
Oh my god!

1100
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:05,610
Oh my god!

1101
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:06,010
Oh my god!

1102
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,040
Just gonna go try the front door you guys.

1103
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,960
Just run.

1104
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,660
Oh!

1105
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,660
Wait, it worked.

1106
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,340
Oh

1107
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,970
my god, it worked!

1108
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:51,330
Yippee!

1109
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,390
Holy cow!

1110
00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:58,630
It's so funny.

1111
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,370
Lemonade.

1112
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:01,490
Banana flavored soda.

1113
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:03,250
A very yellow drink selection.

1114
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:05,430
It's pizza themed.

1115
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:06,450
Weird.

1116
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:07,790
Where are the doors?

1117
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:09,230
Oh, interesting.

1118
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:11,130
Jeff, where are the doors?

1119
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,650
You here to pick up a pizza?

1120
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:14,670
No.

1121
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:15,670
Just hanging out.

1122
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:16,550
Oh.

1123
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,450
Someone with the name...

1124
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:19,670
Ima...

1125
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:21,630
Ima...

1126
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:22,930
Ima...

1127
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:22,990
Ima...

1128
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,190
Ima...

1129
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:24,910
Lucer...

1130
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,150
Called to place an order.

1131
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:29,050
But they still haven't picked up their pizza.

1132
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,190
Ima Lucer.

1133
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,470
Must be new in town.

1134
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:36,110
Lucer.

1135
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:36,770
Lucer.

1136
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:38,630
Jeff.

1137
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,430
I don't think that's a real name.

1138
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,150
Ima Lucer!

1139
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:56,640
Lucer.

1140
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:56,640
Lucer.

1141
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:56,640
Lucer.

1142
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:56,640
Lucer.

1143
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,820
Ima Lucer.

1144
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,260
Ima Lucer.

1145
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:58,940
Oh my god!

1146
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,560
That's so mean!

1147
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,000
Stay in school, kid.

1148
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,480
Jeff.

1149
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,800
Jeff, what happened to the doors?

1150
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,240
What happened to the doors?

1151
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,620
Jeff isn't a loser.

1152
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,020
Jeff owns his own pizza place.

1153
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,260
I think that's pretty respectable.

1154
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,020
I'm not gonna lie.

1155
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:23,740
Free refills for water only.

1156
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,700
Oh, hello sir.

1157
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,240
Oh,

1158
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,780
hello.

1159
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:50,600
The pizza used to be a lot better back in the old days.

1160
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,540
Pizza fan!

1161
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:57,020
Though I have to admit, ever since Jeff took over, it got a lot cheaper.

1162
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,200
Quantity over quality, I guess.

1163
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,280
His own failing pizza place.

1164
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,860
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1165
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,600
We're not judging.

1166
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:04,920
Right!

1167
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:10,980
I mean, sure, it was much better back in its heyday, but...

1168
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,540
He still bought a business.

1169
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,220
And he owns it, right?

1170
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:22,640
Yeah.

1171
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,860
Anything back here?

1172
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,080
I forgot we can go in here and stuff still.

1173
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,560
Anything in here?

1174
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:35,660
Batteries?

1175
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,280
Looked like the games Dad always talked about.

1176
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:40,600
No.

1177
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,760
Let's just turn it off and leave.

1178
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,620
Oh my gosh, I can't see anything.

1179
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,060
Can't see anything.

1180
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,760
Doesn't help that I also have like a glare on my screen from like...

1181
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,020
the window.

1182
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,720
This kid could use some Minto to brighten his day.

1183
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,080
What are you talking about?

1184
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,720
Can we go in here?

1185
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,080
Oh my god!

1186
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,460
Wait, we can!

1187
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,100
A battery!

1188
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,200
Let's go.

1189
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,580
How many batteries do I have?

1190
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,540
Jeff makes the pizza here all by himself.

1191
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,700
Guess he can't afford to hire more staff.

1192
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,020
It's so sad.

1193
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,960
This is a huge freezer.

1194
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,140
Don't want to get locked inside.

1195
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,240
Oh, that's right.

1196
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,820
Oh, I got a power supply.

1197
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,060
Okay.

1198
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,420
Isn't there a room here?

1199
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,660
Why can't we go in here?

1200
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,580
Oh, it's sealed off.

1201
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:41,720
But also!

1202
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,540
In the past, there was like all the kids' bodies in there and stuff.

1203
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,680
Let's see if it says how many batteries I have.

1204
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:51,820
Nope.

1205
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:53,900
Doesn't say at all.

1206
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,340
Yeah, the party room.

1207
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,060
Yeah, there was like a bunch of bodies and stuff.

1208
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,200
Spooky freaky.

1209
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,180
Would be fun to play.

1210
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,160
Okay.

1211
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,640
We got some more stuff so we can fix some more machines.

1212
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,560
Not this one.

1213
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,600
I hate this machine.

1214
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,660
I'm never gonna fix that one.

1215
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,120
Power supply?

1216
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,200
Nice.

1217
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,960
What's this game?

1218
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,220
Let's go gambling!

1219
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,400
Deliver the pizza.

1220
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:27,800
Deliver the pizza.

1221
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:36,670
Pizza time!

1222
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,430
What do you mean game over?

1223
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:41,650
What did I do?

1224
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:50,730
What?

1225
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:59,070
Where do you want me to go?

1226
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:04,760
Huh?

1227
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:10,290
The correct person first?

1228
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:11,890
Excuse you.

1229
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:19,410
How do I know which one is the right one?

1230
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,390
How do I know which one is the correct one first?

1231
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:24,070
Oh, oops.

1232
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:29,330
Frogbert would love this.

1233
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,630
Nah.

1234
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,570
You ran into the people with your second tooth.

1235
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:36,190
Oh, I did?

1236
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:38,510
Wait, hold on.

1237
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:38,830
Let's see.

1238
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:42,210
Are you sure?

1239
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:44,790
Oh.

1240
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:45,810
What?

1241
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:46,890
What?

1242
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,510
Oh, I think I'm pressing too many times.

1243
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:50,410
Okay, I see.

1244
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:50,690
I see.

1245
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:50,970
I see.

1246
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:52,790
Okay.

1247
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:53,190
Okay.

1248
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:53,370
Hold on.

1249
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:53,450
Hold on.

1250
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:56,250
Okay, I get why I'm running.

1251
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:57,430
Okay, I understand now.

1252
00:58:58,630 --> 00:58:59,390
I understand.

1253
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,650
I press like... I kind of spam, right?

1254
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1255
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:04,550
Okay.

1256
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:05,250
Oh my god.

1257
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:06,110
Oh my god.

1258
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,620
Whoa, this map is hard.

1259
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:14,460
Okay.

1260
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:19,870
Nice.

1261
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,240
Nice.

1262
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,740
Nice and nice and nice.

1263
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,920
This one is hard though.

1264
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,380
I got the hard map.

1265
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,620
I think.

1266
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:35,260
Okay.

1267
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:44,270
I never played Frogger as a kid because...

1268
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,890
So I had a friend who...

1269
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:47,790
Oh my god, this one is hard.

1270
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:54,270
Who would invite me over to play games with him.

1271
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:57,730
And he would be the only one to play them.

1272
00:59:58,410 --> 00:59:59,930
And he wouldn't let me play them.

1273
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:01,930
He would...

1274
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:05,070
He would be like, let's play Frogger!

1275
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:06,470
And then played it all by himself.

1276
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:08,650
And then just had me watch the entire time.

1277
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,530
Maybe this is why I have trust issues with friends.

1278
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:16,670
Because...

1279
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:18,990
The kid was...

1280
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,720
And he would always invite me over.

1281
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,500
But he would not let me play the game!

1282
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,400
And I'm like, come on man!

1283
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,320
Like...

1284
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,400
This is not...

1285
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,920
Like I get Frogger is not supposed to be a multiplayer game, right?

1286
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,820
But like, at least give me a chance to play!

1287
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,200
Oh my god.

1288
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,820
I'm killing it, you guys.

1289
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,480
I'm killing it.

1290
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,600
I'm killing it.

1291
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:54,560
Just like the kids.

1292
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,260
Just like William Afton killed those...

1293
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:57,000
KIDS!

1294
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,800
There's too many pizzas to deliver!

1295
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,920
Oh my god.

1296
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:14,840
This is no...

1297
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,180
This is no...

1298
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,140
This is just...

1299
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,240
This is just no!

1300
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,500
Okay, okay, okay.

1301
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,200
When's my turn to play for bugs?

1302
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:26,900
No!

1303
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:36,870
Oh, I almost ran out of time.

1304
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:37,730
Almost ran out of time.

1305
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:42,550
Oh my god.

1306
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:43,290
Oh my god.

1307
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:44,030
Oh my god.

1308
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:46,050
Oh my god.

1309
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:46,490
Oh my god.

1310
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:46,870
Oh my god.

1311
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,190
Let's try and get the harder one first.

1312
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:53,940
Okay, okay.

1313
01:01:58,860 --> 01:01:59,240
Nice!

1314
01:01:59,320 --> 01:01:59,460
Nice!

1315
01:01:59,520 --> 01:01:59,600
Nice!

1316
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,300
You guys!

1317
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:00,800
You guys!

1318
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,120
Yeah!

1319
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:04,500
Yeah!

1320
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,000
Yeah!

1321
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,240
Yeah!

1322
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,000
Okay.

1323
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:11,420
Oh my gosh.

1324
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,640
My fingers are starting to hurt.

1325
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,220
My fingers are starting to hurt, you guys.

1326
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,700
I think I'm gonna be...

1327
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,360
Oh!

1328
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:18,740
There we go.

1329
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:19,400
Oof!

1330
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,200
Oof!

1331
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:23,520
It's okay!

1332
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:24,960
That was good enough.

1333
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,080
Oh, what did we get?

1334
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,120
Road Crossing!

1335
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,140
Okay, nice.

1336
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,120
Hi Vin!

1337
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,220
Thanks for the $20!

1338
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,000
Thank you!

1339
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,580
So yeah, that's why I've never played Frogger before.

1340
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,240
Because I didn't own it, and the one friend that I had that owned it did not let me play it.

1341
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,140
Did she win?

1342
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:44,700
Yeah.

1343
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,440
I think I did.

1344
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,600
I got the prize.

1345
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,100
Oh my gosh, though.

1346
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,560
I forgot to look up...

1347
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,840
I forgot to look up...

1348
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,100
I went to bed after... I did a membership stream last night and I went to bed right afterwards.

1349
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,460
And I forgot to read.

1350
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:08,300
Some people were posting how to do the slide puzzle.

1351
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,280
And I forgot to read it.

1352
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:30,540
Sorry.

1353
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,420
My throat is really killing me today.

1354
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,510
You can do it?

1355
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,130
You think so?

1356
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:44,430
Thank you!

1357
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:45,750
Thanks for the $10!

1358
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:48,410
Thank you, thank you.

1359
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,010
It's okay, I'll get out from under your desk.

1360
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:05,360
Don't say that, because if I get it myself people are gonna be like, Oh, it was the fairy under her desk that solved the puzzle.

1361
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:07,720
Not her.

1362
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:13,550
Oh my...

1363
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:14,070
They're not gonna...

1364
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:15,250
You guys won't believe that it's me!

1365
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,400
It was your idea, though.

1366
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:21,880
I know.

1367
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,120
I should've never said anything about it.

1368
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,780
I should've never said anything about it.

1369
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:30,380
I should've never said anything about it.

1370
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,020
I'm gonna eat my other...

1371
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,220
While I contemplate whether I want to...

1372
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,180
Okay, it's not bad.

1373
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:57,590
It's not so bad.

1374
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:02,410
The company secret is out.

1375
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:02,990
The company secret is out.

1376
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:07,820
Oh my god.

1377
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:09,240
What have we played?

1378
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,660
Twitch plays Pokemon?

1379
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,600
Chat plays slide puzzle.

1380
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,880
I only listen to what you guys say.

1381
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,840
Open up Discord again.

1382
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,260
Make Pataris open up.

1383
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:24,380
Oh no!

1384
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,260
The super chat is from...

1385
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:32,760
PLB?

1386
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,060
Sunsheet music?

1387
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:36,780
What?

1388
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,120
All right, guys.

1389
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:44,700
Solve it.

1390
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:48,920
First down.

1391
01:05:59,320 --> 01:05:59,920
A...

1392
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,540
A...

1393
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,780
Press Alt-F4.

1394
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,540
Down, right, right.

1395
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,180
Right...

1396
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:13,880
Right.

1397
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:14,220
Right.

1398
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,100
Up.

1399
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:18,660
Left.

1400
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,640
There is no right!

1401
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:25,620
I was listening to you!

1402
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,620
I give up.

1403
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,640
Today, we will solve it.

1404
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,100
Mark my words!

1405
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,740
Today, we will solve it.

1406
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:06,780
What's in here?

1407
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,780
Did I go in here before?

1408
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,060
Oh, this is where...

1409
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,820
Why did they take the phone out?

1410
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:15,580
Hello?

1411
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:15,820
Hello?

1412
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,240
The fairy under your desk isn't very smart.

1413
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,620
Some days, it's a fairy.

1414
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,540
Some days...

1415
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:22,560
I don't know.

1416
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,620
It could be like a little... something.

1417
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:26,660
A groundhog.

1418
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,140
I don't know.

1419
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:27,520
Johnny!

1420
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:28,660
Thanks for the 10 gifts!

1421
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,180
What is it?

1422
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,540
Oh, super old TVs.

1423
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,200
I still haven't been able to go into the security room.

1424
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,280
At all.

1425
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:46,460
In any... in even the past or the present.

1426
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,440
So maybe we'll go into the security room today.

1427
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,960
Or maybe that's the last one because...

1428
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,060
Well, we've gone everywhere else.

1429
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,920
No, probably we go into security and...

1430
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,700
This is what?

1431
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:01,920
Night 3?

1432
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:08,500
Go into security room and then we also have to probably go into the party room?

1433
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,080
I bet dad is probably in the party room, right?

1434
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,440
Oh my gosh, should we go in there now?

1435
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,720
Is his like body in there?

1436
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,850
Do we know about Quiet AKA Stephanie Joosten?

1437
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:23,150
There's a YouTube channel.

1438
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:24,170
Oh yeah, I did know!

1439
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:25,630
Wait.

1440
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:26,710
Sorry.

1441
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:28,710
Correction.

1442
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:29,590
I knew she was streaming.

1443
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,750
Someone told me that she was streaming Metal Gear.

1444
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:40,650
I don't want to freak her out or anything though.

1445
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:41,110
Hehehe.

1446
01:08:53,290 --> 01:08:55,770
That thing came from the arcade last time.

1447
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:57,670
Maybe it's keeping dad there.

1448
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:58,630
Chip 2.

1449
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:01,370
I hear the phone ringing.

1450
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:04,050
Oh gosh.

1451
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:08,450
I went in here with such gusto and now I'm afraid.

1452
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:09,090
Hehehe.

1453
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:12,750
The easiest way...

1454
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,390
might actually be...

1455
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:20,650
going to...

1456
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,290
the basement...

1457
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:26,170
and taking the vent...

1458
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:27,890
to the party hallway.

1459
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:29,790
I believe.

1460
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,350
Can I have some of your gusto?

1461
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:34,390
It's like...

1462
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:35,330
It's a...

1463
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:39,090
I haven't... I actually haven't been to a family restaurant yet.

1464
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:42,590
I haven't been out very much, I'll be honest, in Japan.

1465
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:46,030
Like I went to one maid cafe.

1466
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,070
Only one!

1467
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:48,930
And it wasn't even like a real maid cafe.

1468
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:49,450
Like...

1469
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:49,870
Well, no.

1470
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:50,330
That's a lie.

1471
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:52,150
It wasn't your traditional maid cafe.

1472
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:53,670
It was just like a cafe with maids.

1473
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,770
So I'm just like...

1474
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:56,330
I...

1475
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:57,070
I've been pre...

1476
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:58,090
Kind of like...

1477
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:00,470
Just holed up in my hotel room a lot.

1478
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,840
But also since I...

1479
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,580
Since I didn't have my um...

1480
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,120
Wallet...

1481
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,560
I was scared to do anything.

1482
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:14,220
Okay.

1483
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,420
We're gonna drive to the basement strat.

1484
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:15,920
Okay.

1485
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:16,440
Okay.

1486
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,400
I feel like other stuff is gonna be blocked.

1487
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:26,520
You know?

1488
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,380
Oh, but the...

1489
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:29,540
The phone...

1490
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,660
Wait, the phone is in the storage, right?

1491
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,940
Okay, let's go try and get the phone.

1492
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:43,980
I don't hear anyone.

1493
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:47,940
It's in here, right?

1494
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:48,720
I'm scared!

1495
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,120
I'm scared!

1496
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:52,740
Oh, a coin.

1497
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,340
Oh my god.

1498
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:54,300
I just heard something.

1499
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,820
I just heard a door open.

1500
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,380
Oh, no, no.

1501
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:56,800
That's a freezer.

1502
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:57,280
That's a freezer.

1503
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,240
That is...

1504
01:10:59,040 --> 01:10:59,360
Hello?

1505
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:01,780
Hello?

1506
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:02,320
Well...

1507
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,280
If you are still listening...

1508
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:04,900
Wait, what's that picture?

1509
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:07,680
There are certain things they don't tell you when you sign up.

1510
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,040
The animatronic...

1511
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,200
Picture of my family on vacation.

1512
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,280
And if they see a person...

1513
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,500
Dad normally carries this on him.

1514
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,560
And if they see a person...

1515
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,020
Oh my god.

1516
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:15,560
That scared me.

1517
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,920
There are some of those backstage...

1518
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:18,260
Go, go, go.

1519
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,060
Or you haven't checked them out already.

1520
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:20,440
Anyway...

1521
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,140
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

1522
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:23,780
Ah!

1523
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:24,320
Ah!

1524
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:24,420
Ah!

1525
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:24,600
Ah!

1526
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:27,590
Ah!

1527
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:29,930
Did you see me?

1528
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:31,870
Did you see me?!

1529
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:31,890
Ha!

1530
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:32,550
Ha!

1531
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:32,810
Ha!

1532
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:33,050
Ha!

1533
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:49,430
Where am I?

1534
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:52,030
Is that the door to the kitchen or the ball pit?

1535
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:55,070
OK.

1536
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,330
Chica just went to the kitchen, right?

1537
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,600
Chica just went to the kitchen, right?

1538
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,920
So, this door I'm in front of is the ball pit.

1539
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:08,420
I think.

1540
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:11,940
Wait.

1541
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:12,600
Wait, is he actually gone?

1542
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,490
I'm just gonna run a little bit away.

1543
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:23,030
Real quick.

1544
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:23,730
Hold on.

1545
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:24,950
Let's get our bearings real quick.

1546
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:29,950
So, if I go to the party hallway, I can go up into the arcade...

1547
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:30,570
Sorry, phone guy.

1548
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:31,650
I totally interrupted that guy.

1549
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:37,420
Wait, I hear him.

1550
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:37,840
Never mind.

1551
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:38,260
I hear him.

1552
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:38,540
I hear him.

1553
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:43,900
So yeah, we'll go through this door to the party hallway.

1554
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:49,850
I hear him!

1555
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:50,430
I hear him!

1556
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:55,860
Oh, he's scaring me.

1557
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,580
Oh, he makes such creepy noises.

1558
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:02,180
Oh my god, it looks like my body became... I became Springtrap for a second.

1559
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,380
Wait, did he see me?

1560
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:19,940
Uh oh.

1561
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:23,940
I don't know what just happened.

1562
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:25,880
What just happened?

1563
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,210
Oh, it was Chica!

1564
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,880
Wait, she just went through the hall!

1565
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,320
Oh no!

1566
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:41,720
Oh my gosh.

1567
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,480
She just went into the arcade!

1568
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:45,920
No!

1569
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:46,760
Oh no!

1570
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,880
I don't know which door Springtrap went through!

1571
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,540
I should have been looking.

1572
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,740
I should have looked.

1573
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,980
At least Chica... Okay, so Chica alerts Springtrap.

1574
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,100
But she doesn't, like, grab you, it seems.

1575
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,260
Which isn't so bad, as long as there's a place to hide, right?

1576
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,800
But we can't go into the arcade because Chica just went in there.

1577
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,880
Oh, oh, here she comes, here she comes.

1578
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:22,800
Oh, never mind.

1579
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:28,640
What the... How did you... When you went to the... Maybe he went in a circle.

1580
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:31,420
Maybe.

1581
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:32,060
I think.

1582
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,020
He must have gone in a circle, I guess.

1583
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,440
That is not Chica.

1584
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,440
Where is Chica?

1585
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:44,860
Okay, bye.

1586
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,460
Do you think it's fine to go in there?

1587
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,660
Even if she's in the arcade?

1588
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:57,940
Do you think it's fine to... I don't actually know if this pauses the game either, so it kind of freaks me out.

1589
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,920
But the arcade has nowhere to hide.

1590
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,460
The storage has... Freddy?

1591
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,000
So let's go maybe in there.

1592
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,020
Where does this vent go to?

1593
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,320
Oh, it goes to the entrance.

1594
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:27,660
Okay.

1595
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,280
Maybe I go to the entrance.

1596
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:33,560
Wait, I don't know.

1597
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:34,540
But she's still in here.

1598
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:35,360
Assuming.

1599
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:37,440
I'm assuming she's still in there.

1600
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,100
I can't hear her anymore.

1601
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,620
Oh my god, the sound.

1602
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:45,340
Is that a photo?

1603
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:47,620
This is my school picture from last year.

1604
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,200
Dad always keeps this on him.

1605
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,080
Oh my god.

1606
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:50,520
Oh my god.

1607
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:51,740
Get in there.

1608
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:51,980
Get in there.

1609
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,480
That's where Chica is.

1610
01:15:58,420 --> 01:15:59,220
Oh my god.

1611
01:15:59,300 --> 01:15:59,800
Rhyme Snap!

1612
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,400
What are you doing?

1613
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,360
Thanks for the time, Gilton.

1614
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,680
Look at her... look at her stalking.

1615
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:09,300
Go away.

1616
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,200
Why are you camping?

1617
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,040
Get out of here.

1618
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:21,740
Let's eat.

1619
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:27,940
No, no, no, no.

1620
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:28,680
No, no, no, no, no.

1621
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:29,340
Chica, Chica, Chica.

1622
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,360
Go downstairs, please.

1623
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,060
Chica!

1624
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:51,180
Hello?

1625
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,680
Oh my god.

1626
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,680
The door is...

1627
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:01,920
Who are you?

1628
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:05,280
What?

1629
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:11,620
Are things that are happening in the past affecting the present?

1630
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:17,980
Like, so this endoskeleton broke the doors and that's why the doors disappeared in the present?

1631
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,120
But like, just fix them.

1632
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,640
It's Benny Big Bear.

1633
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,300
Okay, guys.

1634
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,940
We're just gonna make a run for it.

1635
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:41,230
Hopefully no one's in here.

1636
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:42,570
The door is locked.

1637
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:43,610
I need to find another way.

1638
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:44,870
Okay.

1639
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:55,620
Oh, I do have to go through the party hallway then probably.

1640
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:56,400
No!

1641
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,360
Beekeeper, welcome to membership.

1642
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,780
And Rokkimei, welcome to membership.

1643
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:03,680
Thank you, guys.

1644
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:04,440
Thank you, thank you.

1645
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:07,600
Dang it.

1646
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:13,250
Oh.

1647
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,610
Someone's coming.

1648
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:17,750
I think.

1649
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:21,670
Someone's coming.

1650
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:22,130
I hear them.

1651
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:28,190
I can't tell where they are.

1652
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:33,320
I can...

1653
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,120
I can't tell where they are.

1654
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:38,920
They're here!

1655
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,740
Yeah, get out of here.

1656
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:45,900
Wait, he's going in security.

1657
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:49,680
Which, there's nothing else in there that we know of currently.

1658
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:56,890
Oh my god.

1659
01:18:56,910 --> 01:18:57,310
No, no, no.

1660
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:57,850
Please hide.

1661
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:58,170
Please.

1662
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:58,910
Hide.

1663
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,960
I don't think I hear anything.

1664
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,160
I think we can go in.

1665
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:09,740
Wait.

1666
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,100
The door is locked!

1667
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:13,960
Here too!

1668
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,060
Wait.

1669
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,560
What other way is there to get in?

1670
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:24,200
Do I maybe go to the entrance after all and maybe move the exoskeleton?

1671
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,360
Hmm.

1672
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,920
He is the security guard.

1673
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:31,680
No!

1674
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,040
Okay, let's go back to storage, I guess.

1675
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,880
It's kind of icky.

1676
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:44,860
Is there a vent?

1677
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:45,980
I don't think so.

1678
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:49,320
I don't think so.

1679
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,820
Does security have anything of importance?

1680
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:56,800
The only thing I know about security is we have not been in security.

1681
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,220
So it's the only place that we haven't been yet.

1682
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:02,240
Okay.

1683
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:07,680
Oh.

1684
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,600
Who am I hearing?

1685
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:15,230
Someone...

1686
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:16,610
Where are they?

1687
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:22,810
Oh!

1688
01:20:22,930 --> 01:20:23,270
Oh!

1689
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:29,090
The door is clearly not locked!

1690
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:32,490
I don't think animatronics have special keys now, do they?

1691
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,420
Oh my god.

1692
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:47,100
Oh my good.

1693
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,520
I don't know which door he went through.

1694
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:59,560
I don't know if he is in there or if he went down.

1695
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:08,980
Let's just go for it.

1696
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:10,280
Be brave.

1697
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:11,700
Woah!

1698
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:12,640
Woah woah woah.

1699
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,260
What was that shiny?

1700
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:14,320
Wait wait wait wait.

1701
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:16,980
Did you see that shiny up there?

1702
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:18,920
Stretching hand?

1703
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:20,440
There's something shiny in there.

1704
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:21,300
If only I could...

1705
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:21,940
Wait a second.

1706
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,180
My sticky hand!

1707
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,660
I got a key.

1708
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,980
Oh my god.

1709
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:29,980
Oh my god.

1710
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:31,440
Oswald, please.

1711
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:31,780
Please.

1712
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:42,080
Sorry, I guess you guys couldn't see it because the chat was blocking it a little bit probably.

1713
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,640
But good stuff.

1714
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:55,830
Let's just go for it.

1715
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,820
That doesn't seem very good.

1716
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,620
Find something to lure the rabbit out.

1717
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,200
That was close!

1718
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,140
Maybe if I knew more about that thing, I could somehow lure it away.

1719
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,420
Okay, let's read the diary again.

1720
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,760
Our special diary.

1721
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:36,440
Wherever it is.

1722
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:42,320
Oh my god, my mom is hot!

1723
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,960
Dad took this photo of me and mom on our last beach trip.

1724
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:51,840
Dad and I got so sunburned that mom kept calling us a pair of lobsters.

1725
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,740
We should have reapplied Sunday.

1726
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,960
But dad and I were too busy swimming to remember.

1727
01:22:58,760 --> 01:22:59,640
Hot mama!

1728
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:03,380
Not sure how mom puts up with us sometimes.

1729
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:12,050
Dad always takes a photo of me on the first day of school.

1730
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:13,070
It's kind of embarrassing.

1731
01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:14,610
But I think it makes him happy.

1732
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:18,190
He wasn't able to take a photo on my first day.

1733
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:20,910
I was just about to say he didn't take a photo this year.

1734
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:24,210
He wasn't able to take a photo on my first day this year.

1735
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:25,170
Aww.

1736
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:27,950
It's so sad.

1737
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:30,630
One out of five.

1738
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:31,650
Two out of five.

1739
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:33,890
Three out of five.

1740
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:35,550
So we have three out of five things.

1741
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:38,490
What am I looking for?

1742
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,210
Oh, the sketchbook.

1743
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:40,490
That's right.

1744
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:46,950
So this has information about the different animatronics.

1745
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:49,630
So we knew the things about the no eating around Chica.

1746
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:51,450
She could smell my food.

1747
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,470
And we also brought her a pizza.

1748
01:23:55,890 --> 01:23:57,890
Do not attempt to play Bonnie's guitar.

1749
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:00,650
Bonnie's guitar.

1750
01:24:00,890 --> 01:24:01,830
Where was that?

1751
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:02,490
In the basement?

1752
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:03,490
I think?

1753
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:08,130
Any voice box malfunctions must be reported to upper management.

1754
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:12,790
Adjusted hug fractured a kid's back again.

1755
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:23,160
Yeah, that's what I meant.

1756
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:23,880
Backstage, right?

1757
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:24,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1758
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,900
That's where his guitar was.

1759
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,640
By night five, we're gonna have to be dealing with all three of these...

1760
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,100
Or all of these guys, aren't we?

1761
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:39,440
The three of them, plus Springtrap, plus this little...

1762
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:41,960
cupcake monster.

1763
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:56,750
Okay.

1764
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,780
I guess I have to go to the backstage.

1765
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:08,800
Was there anywhere to hide back there?

1766
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,340
Oh, I think actually...

1767
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,440
I think there was... Oh yeah, the vent.

1768
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:15,720
Oh no, that's in the basement.

1769
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:16,280
Oh shoot.

1770
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:22,860
The double doors to the arcade are destroyed.

1771
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:25,080
Oswald, you created a time paradox!

1772
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,380
You can't go changing the future like that!

1773
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,320
Oswald the Ocelot.

1774
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:34,760
Okay.

1775
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,260
I just have to be brave.

1776
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:41,180
I'm not very brave!

1777
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,180
Where are we?

1778
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:43,600
We're in storage.

1779
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:46,480
We have to get pretty far to get backstage.

1780
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,680
Alright, let's go.

1781
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:52,480
I don't think I hear anything.

1782
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:56,080
Oh, that's a scream?

1783
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:58,420
Oh my god!

1784
01:25:58,600 --> 01:25:59,040
Why?

1785
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:08,310
Am I good?

1786
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:10,810
No, I'm not good.

1787
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:21,790
Get out of here.

1788
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:23,430
Get out of here.

1789
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:24,550
Get out of here.

1790
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:25,590
Oh my god.

1791
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,670
Get out of here!

1792
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:31,250
Why are you both here?

1793
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:39,030
Oh, come on.

1794
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:39,670
This is so unfair.

1795
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:42,810
And he's coming back, I think.

1796
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:45,090
Okay.

1797
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:47,310
Does he go into the kitchen?

1798
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:51,890
I think this is my chance.

1799
01:26:53,230 --> 01:26:53,590
Oh

1800
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:03,970
no.

1801
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:05,190
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1802
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,280
Where does this lead again to?

1803
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:23,190
Oh, so we lure him and then we take this.

1804
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:24,230
Okay, easy peasy.

1805
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:29,870
Okay, so we'll activate the guitar.

1806
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:31,830
Run in here.

1807
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:33,710
Take the vent.

1808
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:35,930
Leave.

1809
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:38,890
Too dark to see.

1810
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:41,350
Yeah, it's really dark.

1811
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:43,270
But it's okay because I know where the vent is.

1812
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:49,210
Let's go.

1813
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,140
Please don't be in here.

1814
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:06,190
There we go.

1815
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:08,630
This is that blue rabbit's guitar.

1816
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:09,890
But the strings are broken.

1817
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:13,450
Oh, I bet I can find some old ones in the garage?

1818
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:18,490
Find something to fix the guitar.

1819
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:21,990
The...

1820
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:24,670
My garage at home?

1821
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:27,250
Oh, garbage!

1822
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:45,720
Thank you for the 50 gifted.

1823
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,280
Thank you.

1824
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:50,680
Garbage.

1825
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,060
So maybe I do go to the present then.

1826
01:28:54,140 --> 01:28:54,920
After all.

1827
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,200
My Yoshi can't read.

1828
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,560
Stop making fun of me!

1829
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:10,020
I think you need that coffee.

1830
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:10,920
I think so too.

1831
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,280
Good golly.

1832
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:15,600
Okay.

1833
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:18,460
To the garbage.

1834
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:20,360
Not the garage.

1835
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:21,720
I was like, I don't think...

1836
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,060
I was like, we have a basement.

1837
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:23,960
I don't think we have a garage.

1838
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,180
Everything good?

1839
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:30,640
Oh, hey Jeff.

1840
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:33,140
There aren't some old guitar strings lying around here somewhere, are there?

1841
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,560
My Kamiyoshi can't read, but she's cute.

1842
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:36,240
So it's okay.

1843
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:37,680
Guitar strings?

1844
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:39,880
There could have been when I bought this place.

1845
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:42,120
But I just had about everything trashed.

1846
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:48,860
This place used to be one of those germ infested kitty pizza places with that dumb robot band.

1847
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:50,980
You mean animatronics?

1848
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:52,400
Any who?

1849
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:53,900
Never mind.

1850
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:55,520
Okay, Jeff.

1851
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:56,920
You told us to stay in school.

1852
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:58,280
I think you need to take your own advice.

1853
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:05,490
Let's go to the mill.

1854
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:17,240
That looks like some guitar strings.

1855
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,920
Who knew Oswald the ocelot...

1856
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:27,600
Oh my god, this kid.

1857
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:29,660
Was also Oswald the raccoon.

1858
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,020
This will definitely make headlines in school.

1859
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,580
Why do you laugh like that, you freak?

1860
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:42,160
What's he doing here?

1861
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:42,900
Whatever.

1862
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,040
I can worry about him.

1863
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,300
I can't worry about him right now.

1864
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,240
I need to get back.

1865
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:57,280
Okay.

1866
01:30:58,460 --> 01:30:59,840
That spooked me good though.

1867
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,860
That actually got me.

1868
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:02,640
I think I might make coffee for real.

1869
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,520
Is it okay if I make it?

1870
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:04,140
Actually?

1871
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:06,340
Shouldn't take too long.

1872
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:09,200
It's one of those, like, espresso machines.

1873
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,320
You know that, like, coffee machine?

1874
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,700
Like, how hotels have those in their rooms.

1875
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,940
My throat has just been killing me.

1876
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:21,760
I woke up with, like, a stuffy nose.

1877
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:35,120
I'm wondering if me, like, going out in the heat and sweating all day and then coming into a cold room or, like, you know, going...

1878
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:39,240
It's basically me going hot, cold, hot, cold, hot, cold because I'll, like, go into a cafe or something.

1879
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,800
And I'll be covered in sweat.

1880
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,600
And then...

1881
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:48,220
You know, stuff like that.

1882
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:51,600
Can I get a quick happy birthday from my community?

1883
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:52,780
Sunchips!

1884
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:53,480
Happy birthday!

1885
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:57,120
Happy birthday to you.

1886
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:00,660
Happy birthday to you.

1887
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:04,800
Happy birthday, dear Sunchips.

1888
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,920
Happy birthday to you.

1889
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,200
Happy birthday!

1890
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:15,580
Yeah, I don't know.

1891
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:18,420
It's just been, like, my nose or my throat right now.

1892
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,800
My nose is a little bit stuffed, but...

1893
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,140
Okay.

1894
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:24,960
I'm going to make some coffee real quick before we go back into the past.

1895
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:29,760
Yes, yes.

1896
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,180
Oh, I'm going to the wrong place.

1897
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:32,200
Okay.

1898
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,760
Give me, like, two minutes to make some coffee.

1899
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:22,960
We're back.

1900
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,200
One minute's passed.

1901
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:24,360
Oh, my gosh.

1902
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:24,960
She hates us.

1903
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:25,440
What are you...

1904
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,760
I said two minutes.

1905
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:27,960
I said two minutes.

1906
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:28,400
Okay.

1907
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:29,660
Oh, my gosh.

1908
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:32,100
So, I also went to the bathroom while it was...

1909
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:33,520
While it was brewing.

1910
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,160
And I had, like...

1911
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:36,900
I was, like, oh, my gosh.

1912
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,100
Did I forget to mute?

1913
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:42,440
Did I forget to mute?

1914
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:44,580
You'll come back.

1915
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:45,100
Thank you.

1916
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,540
I got my coffee.

1917
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,100
Can you hear it?

1918
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:55,980
Did you wash your hands?

1919
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:56,320
Of course.

1920
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,840
Hey, I always wash my hands.

1921
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:11,800
Unfortunately, it did mute.

1922
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:13,800
Unfortunately.

1923
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,200
I don't think you would even be able to hear anything.

1924
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,560
Maybe just the toilet flushing.

1925
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:20,520
Probably.

1926
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:27,000
Oh, my gosh.

1927
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:27,340
This tastes so good.

1928
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:29,000
Ew.

1929
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:30,960
Ew.

1930
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:31,720
Ew.

1931
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:32,520
Ew.

1932
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:34,320
Ew.

1933
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:35,340
Ew.

1934
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:35,900
Ew.

1935
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:35,960
Ew.

1936
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:40,740
Ew.

1937
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:41,300
Ew.

1938
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:41,340
Ew.

1939
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:41,820
Ew.

1940
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:42,660
This tastes so good.

1941
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,580
Sometimes I'm...

1942
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:48,400
Sometimes I'm just not in a coffee mood.

1943
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,120
But lately I have been.

1944
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:52,940
Just wanting like creamy and all.

1945
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:56,860
What if by accident you just forgot?

1946
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:58,020
Shut up.

1947
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:00,480
Mint is into Ace Attorney?

1948
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:01,860
Yeah!

1949
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:02,760
I love Ace Attorney!

1950
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:08,830
Is it face coffee?

1951
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:17,840
No, actually I've never had face coffee.

1952
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:18,780
Is it actually any good?

1953
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:22,880
Thanks for being a goober, Mint!

1954
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:27,420
You're one in a million and if you were a booger in a stuffy nose, I'd pick you first.

1955
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:32,300
May a thousand wet cat noses calm your soul.

1956
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:35,560
Thanks?

1957
01:37:44,910 --> 01:37:45,310
No.

1958
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:55,390
I tried Leah coffee, not bad.

1959
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:56,770
But I make mine really sweet.

1960
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:57,710
I see, I see.

1961
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:58,690
There's a Leah brew.

1962
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:01,430
Maybe I'll have to get that.

1963
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:03,490
Is it like a light brew or a dark brew though?

1964
01:38:08,110 --> 01:38:10,110
I got a haunted postcard today!

1965
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:11,090
It was beautiful!

1966
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:12,690
Yay!

1967
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:15,550
I'm so glad that they're showing up at people's places now.

1968
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:18,410
No more.

1969
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:20,790
Stop!

1970
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:26,170
Stop replying to that super chat!

1971
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:34,240
The worst feature YouTube has ever implemented!

1972
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:43,320
Stop!

1973
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:46,120
You freaks!

1974
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,540
You're all freaks!

1975
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:54,760
You're all freaks, you're all freaks!

1976
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:00,420
Okay, here we go.

1977
01:39:06,970 --> 01:39:07,970
What is a+.1?

1978
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:08,950
Wait, hold on, I missed it.

1979
01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:10,990
Why are we plus one-ing?

1980
01:39:14,530 --> 01:39:16,110
Oh, plus one, plus one.

1981
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:17,350
For the cat?

1982
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:18,890
Or for what?

1983
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:19,610
For the booger?

1984
01:39:19,730 --> 01:39:20,150
I don't know.

1985
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:23,310
Uh oh, I think I just broke my chat.

1986
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:24,310
Hold on, I gotta refresh.

1987
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:26,270
Give me a second, guys.

1988
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:32,350
Oh, I got a chat summary!

1989
01:39:32,630 --> 01:39:38,790
Viewers in the chat are making various comments about a name, finding the chat entertaining, and joking about the chat reflecting the streamer's personality.

1990
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:53,440
What's that?

1991
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:55,540
Outlander.

1992
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:01,340
Okay, so we go backstage.

1993
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,300
Okay, let's just do it.

1994
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:04,900
Let's just do it.

1995
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:06,640
Fix the guitar.

1996
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:10,220
I'm scared.

1997
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:14,820
I'm scared.

1998
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,180
Do you think he's gonna come in here?

1999
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,980
Probably won't sound good, but at least it works.

2000
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:25,600
Wait.

2001
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:26,280
Oh my god.

2002
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:27,240
Wait, where do I go?

2003
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,300
I think he's coming.

2004
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:28,820
I think he's coming.

2005
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:29,300
I think he's coming.

2006
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:29,600
For real?

2007
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:39,780
Wait, I thought we were gonna like... Wait, this is going against everything that I thought we were going to do.

2008
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:41,180
Wait.

2009
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:50,940
So do I bring the guitars to him?

2010
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:52,460
Or do I... Where do I play it?

2011
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:52,680
Huh?

2012
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:53,600
Oh my gosh.

2013
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,420
What is happening?

2014
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:58,420
Plus two cat noses.

2015
01:40:58,500 --> 01:40:59,240
Thank you.

2016
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:02,420
Thank you.

2017
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:05,680
Where do I put... lure the rabbit out?

2018
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:09,820
Is it that cord?

2019
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:12,700
Oh, the stage.

2020
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,660
Yes, it's the cord on the stage, isn't it?

2021
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:15,960
I knew it.

2022
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:17,820
Okay, okay, okay.

2023
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:18,580
We'll go back.

2024
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:19,000
We'll go back.

2025
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:27,260
I thought we were playing... I don't know.

2026
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:28,240
I don't know, man.

2027
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:29,000
I don't know.

2028
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:33,800
Oh, he's in here.

2029
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:34,880
Okay, that's good though.

2030
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:35,600
That's good actually.

2031
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:37,900
That's good.

2032
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:39,200
Move back.

2033
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:41,340
Okay, so we know he's in here.

2034
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:42,780
So we can leave here.

2035
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,260
And we can go...

2036
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:52,200
here.

2037
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:55,320
Okay, okay, okay.

2038
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:05,880
Okay, freaks.

2039
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:08,300
Okay, freaks.

2040
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,020
Let's jam.

2041
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,480
Oh my god, I'm scared.

2042
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:14,300
Oh, don't!

2043
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:14,460
W.

2044
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:15,820
W.

2045
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:17,440
A.

2046
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:19,820
Uh-oh.

2047
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:20,720
I need to get out of here.

2048
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:21,460
Run, run, run!

2049
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:24,580
Look for a place to hide.

2050
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:25,840
Oh my god.

2051
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:26,580
Sorry.

2052
01:42:34,110 --> 01:42:34,810
Okay, okay, okay.

2053
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:39,050
He came really fast.

2054
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:42,170
Why didn't you leave sooner?

2055
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:43,950
Space,

2056
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:47,750
space, space, space!

2057
01:42:51,450 --> 01:42:53,390
I don't think I spaced hard enough, you guys.

2058
01:42:53,530 --> 01:42:54,210
Dang it!

2059
01:42:55,370 --> 01:42:57,730
Oh, I thought it was just like a quick time, you know?

2060
01:42:57,770 --> 01:42:59,250
I didn't realize it was a spammy one.

2061
01:43:01,190 --> 01:43:02,750
I didn't realize it was a spammy one.

2062
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:05,250
Wait, how far back do I have to go?

2063
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:09,880
Oh.

2064
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,360
Okay, so I have the guitar.

2065
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:15,100
I hear him though.

2066
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:16,800
I hear him.

2067
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:18,980
I'm gonna have to come back and hide...

2068
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,040
in here.

2069
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,000
Let's do what we did before.

2070
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,180
Maybe he'll go back to this room.

2071
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:35,780
Oh, he is in this room!

2072
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:36,400
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

2073
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:42,180
Yeah.

2074
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:46,700
It's the quick time versus the spamming ones.

2075
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:47,340
I don't...

2076
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:48,620
Oh my gosh, please.

2077
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:49,120
Oswald.

2078
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:57,200
I didn't get it right.

2079
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:57,700
That's okay.

2080
01:43:57,820 --> 01:43:59,440
Like I pressed it and then it wasn't...

2081
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:01,160
I wasn't spamming it.

2082
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:01,880
It's my bad.

2083
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:02,980
Okay, freaks.

2084
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:03,580
Let's jam!

2085
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:05,600
W.

2086
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:09,660
S?

2087
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:10,100
S?

2088
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:11,340
D.

2089
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:12,860
Okay.

2090
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:13,540
Get out of here!

2091
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:14,360
Get out of here!

2092
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:15,480
Get out of here!

2093
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:17,380
Oh my god, please.

2094
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:18,820
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2095
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,300
Please, run, run, run, run, run.

2096
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:21,320
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2097
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:23,080
Okay, this part is timed.

2098
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:24,840
This part is scripted.

2099
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:27,040
Nice.

2100
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:28,440
Okay.

2101
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:30,300
All right, here we go.

2102
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:36,410
All right.

2103
01:44:37,810 --> 01:44:38,470
I'm already...

2104
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:39,190
I'm pre-spamming.

2105
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:39,730
I'm pre-spamming.

2106
01:44:39,730 --> 01:44:40,250
I'm pre-spamming.

2107
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:41,790
Nice.

2108
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:43,370
Yeah.

2109
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:45,870
I'll have to follow the vents.

2110
01:44:48,070 --> 01:44:48,430
Oh.

2111
01:44:48,670 --> 01:44:49,030
Oh.

2112
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:49,610
Okay.

2113
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:50,110
Oh.

2114
01:44:50,130 --> 01:44:50,490
Oh my god.

2115
01:44:50,590 --> 01:44:50,950
Oh my...

2116
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:51,570
Okay.

2117
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:52,730
Yikes.

2118
01:44:52,730 --> 01:44:53,190
That was close.

2119
01:44:53,450 --> 01:44:54,470
Gotta get back to the arcade.

2120
01:44:55,010 --> 01:44:55,370
Okay.

2121
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:56,150
Um.

2122
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:57,410
Okay.

2123
01:44:57,850 --> 01:44:59,210
Can I hide under this table?

2124
01:44:59,310 --> 01:44:59,470
No.

2125
01:44:59,550 --> 01:44:59,930
I can only hide under this table.

2126
01:45:01,390 --> 01:45:01,790
Okay.

2127
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:03,390
Okay.

2128
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:07,490
Why did we climb out of that one?

2129
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:07,750
Wait.

2130
01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:12,870
Why didn't you climb out of the one closer to the door, you stupid idiot?

2131
01:45:13,770 --> 01:45:14,890
Oswald, use your brain!

2132
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:25,900
I think we're okay.

2133
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:37,450
Where's my...

2134
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:37,870
Oh my god.

2135
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:38,570
Oh my god.

2136
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:40,190
It's bonking my friend.

2137
01:45:43,910 --> 01:45:44,310
Chip!

2138
01:45:44,430 --> 01:45:44,550
Chip!

2139
01:45:45,190 --> 01:45:46,110
Are you alive?

2140
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:47,370
He's got brain damage.

2141
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:48,970
Thanks.

2142
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:51,090
I don't know what that...

2143
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:51,850
Thank me later.

2144
01:45:52,030 --> 01:45:53,090
Was there a grown-up with you?

2145
01:45:53,730 --> 01:45:54,170
No.

2146
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:55,190
Have you seen Mike?

2147
01:45:56,010 --> 01:45:56,910
I found him.

2148
01:45:56,970 --> 01:45:57,670
He's safe now.

2149
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:00,550
Okay.

2150
01:46:02,030 --> 01:46:02,470
Oh.

2151
01:46:02,910 --> 01:46:03,690
Come on, man.

2152
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:04,430
We gotta split.

2153
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:05,390
No.

2154
01:46:05,470 --> 01:46:05,790
I...

2155
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:08,530
Ah!

2156
01:46:08,730 --> 01:46:09,170
Freddy!

2157
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:10,430
Oh my god.

2158
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:10,810
Ah!

2159
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:11,410
Oh my god.

2160
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:13,750
Oh my god.

2161
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:14,090
Oh my god.

2162
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:14,130
Oh my god.

2163
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:15,830
Get out of here!

2164
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:18,350
Hide in here!

2165
01:46:19,150 --> 01:46:19,750
Oh, shoot.

2166
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:21,590
I just realized the objective was to escape.

2167
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:22,230
I'm an idiot.

2168
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:23,590
Run, run, run, run, run!

2169
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:26,550
To the ball pit!

2170
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:27,090
Oh, shoot.

2171
01:46:27,190 --> 01:46:27,770
To the ball pit!

2172
01:46:28,530 --> 01:46:28,790
Ah!

2173
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:35,860
Hoor!

2174
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:36,280
Hoor!

2175
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:36,660
Hoor!

2176
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:37,180
Hoor!

2177
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:37,540
Hoor!

2178
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:37,980
Hoor!

2179
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:38,080
Hoor!

2180
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:38,160
Hoor!

2181
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:42,760
Hoor!

2182
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:42,880
Hoor!

2183
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:45,320
Hoor!

2184
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:45,380
Hoor!

2185
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:45,640
Hoor!

2186
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:53,280
Hoor!

2187
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:53,900
Day four!

2188
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:55,540
Uh-oh.

2189
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:58,220
Was it looking a little more corrupted than usual?

2190
01:46:59,000 --> 01:46:59,140
Ah.

2191
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:00,220
Off to school.

2192
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:02,800
No idea how I'll make it through the day.

2193
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:03,700
I barely slept.

2194
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:09,270
Let's pet the cat.

2195
01:47:14,030 --> 01:47:15,130
This little baby.

2196
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:26,200
Who is that bunny I see?

2197
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:29,960
Staring straight back at me.

2198
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:31,760
There's a lot of clothes in there.

2199
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:33,240
I check every time.

2200
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:37,160
And the pictures.

2201
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,440
Some of them... some of the dialogues change.

2202
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:40,420
Some of them don't.

2203
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:44,100
Oh, Mom?

2204
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:46,600
Mom?

2205
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:48,620
Where's my lunch, Mom?

2206
01:47:58,190 --> 01:47:59,550
Why was it making that sound?

2207
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,340
These dusty old boxes have been down here for as long as I can remember.

2208
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:11,760
The thought of holding a knife or whatever.

2209
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:12,260
Yeah.

2210
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:12,520
Yeah.

2211
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:14,040
Huh.

2212
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:22,330
Why is it laughing?

2213
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:24,870
Wait, is he...

2214
01:48:26,450 --> 01:48:26,970
Mom?

2215
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:29,030
Morning, Oz.

2216
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:30,230
Double shift today and tomorrow.

2217
01:48:30,490 --> 01:48:30,690
Boo.

2218
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:32,530
Be safe getting to school.

2219
01:48:37,590 --> 01:48:38,710
Is he patrolling?

2220
01:48:40,870 --> 01:48:42,470
Oh, he's patrolling, isn't he?

2221
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:43,270
No.

2222
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,950
He's not.

2223
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:46,090
He's not, because it's not allowing me to hide.

2224
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:49,670
He's probably waiting for me.

2225
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:52,530
At the... at the front door.

2226
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:53,530
Right?

2227
01:48:54,610 --> 01:48:55,050
No?

2228
01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:55,930
Okay.

2229
01:48:58,610 --> 01:48:59,590
Do I just go?

2230
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:02,590
Oh my god, it's really creepy!

2231
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:03,670
Where is he?!

2232
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:06,910
Oh my gosh, it's so scary!

2233
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:08,190
Oh, I should go to school.

2234
01:49:08,410 --> 01:49:08,870
Oh, okay.

2235
01:49:11,290 --> 01:49:12,090
Okay, I'm leaving!

2236
01:49:13,190 --> 01:49:14,570
Bye, Springtrap Dad!

2237
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:26,740
That was so creepy!

2238
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:28,720
He's Spring Dad.

2239
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:30,520
Spring Dad.

2240
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:33,760
The animatronic characters here get a bit quirky at night.

2241
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:37,240
Go to class.

2242
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:38,440
What's going on?

2243
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:39,720
Why is everything so different?

2244
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:40,920
It's smoky.

2245
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:41,860
It's foggy.

2246
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:45,700
Oh, okay, there are people here!

2247
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:48,960
Hello, fellows.

2248
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:49,440
Students?

2249
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:53,320
Principal?

2250
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:56,420
Anybody here?

2251
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:57,080
No?

2252
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:58,100
Nothing?

2253
01:49:58,360 --> 01:49:58,540
Okay.

2254
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:02,060
Silent Hill now.

2255
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:06,580
How do you do, fellow kids?

2256
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:09,600
Hoops?

2257
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:11,260
Now?

2258
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:12,520
Come on!

2259
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,720
That's how I would always remember how to spell principal.

2260
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:19,040
Because it's a principal.

2261
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:22,940
Except that's a big ol' lie.

2262
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:24,220
They don't do anything for you.

2263
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,020
Let's see.

2264
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:28,820
Ooh, what are you guys talking about?

2265
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:31,100
Oh.

2266
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:34,420
I can't join in on their conversation.

2267
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:36,100
Okay, what about you?

2268
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:38,880
Nobody will talk to me!

2269
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:39,840
Hello?

2270
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:41,100
Oh no!

2271
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:44,940
It's because they all think I'm a raccoon!

2272
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:50,080
Hey, look, it's Oswald the raccoon!

2273
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:56,500
I'm surprised he's not still out digging in the dumps.

2274
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:00,600
Yeah, he probably smells right at home there.

2275
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:26,240
Oh my god!

2276
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,260
What's the matter, Snoswald?

2277
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:35,100
Looks like you're ready to puke.

2278
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:38,040
Maybe all that trash has made him sick.

2279
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,480
Maybe he's finally losing it.

2280
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,320
Mr. Crab's last finesse.

2281
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:56,020
Oh my god!

2282
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:57,020
Ossie!

2283
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:58,540
Oh no!

2284
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:00,280
I gotta get out of here!

2285
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:04,020
Go to the ball pit?

2286
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:06,680
Already?

2287
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:09,080
I'm going to the ball pit so soon!

2288
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:12,380
Why am I craving the ball pit?

2289
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:13,520
He craves the pit.

2290
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:14,980
He craves the pit.

2291
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:17,640
What if I go to the library?

2292
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:19,320
Just get a good book to read.

2293
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:26,910
What do you mean each spot has its own... wait, what is this?

2294
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:29,710
Hey firecracker kid.

2295
01:52:31,170 --> 01:52:32,710
Ha, still dig that name.

2296
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:34,990
You still want to trade for one?

2297
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:36,410
Yeah, I have this.

2298
01:52:37,370 --> 01:52:38,450
Not the sticky hand.

2299
01:52:38,670 --> 01:52:39,730
We have the Freddy mask.

2300
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:42,770
Animatronics aren't as scary when they're Fortnite dancing.

2301
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:45,890
Oh nice, you got yourself a trade.

2302
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:46,890
Awesome.

2303
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:47,410
Thanks.

2304
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:49,430
Pleasure doing business with you.

2305
01:52:50,290 --> 01:52:53,750
I got... I got firecrackers!

2306
01:52:53,890 --> 01:52:55,610
Uh, not... what?

2307
01:52:55,670 --> 01:52:57,950
Did he just stick that mask in his pants?

2308
01:52:58,630 --> 01:52:59,910
Alright, let's go to the pit now.

2309
01:53:04,390 --> 01:53:05,350
The Pizzeria.

2310
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:10,880
Go to the ball pit.

2311
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:11,600
Go to the ball pit.

2312
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:14,280
Jeff?

2313
01:53:22,570 --> 01:53:23,890
Don't have the right item.

2314
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:25,590
There's still items I'm missing.

2315
01:53:26,490 --> 01:53:27,490
Oh wait, what's this one?

2316
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:28,030
I have it.

2317
01:53:28,230 --> 01:53:29,130
What could it be?

2318
01:53:29,390 --> 01:53:30,130
Oh, the balls?

2319
01:53:31,110 --> 01:53:32,050
That's all I needed?

2320
01:53:32,150 --> 01:53:32,650
Was the balls?

2321
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:37,520
Let's go.

2322
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:39,620
Oh no.

2323
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:40,420
Oh wait.

2324
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:41,840
Wait.

2325
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:43,300
Oh no.

2326
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:57,020
I'll be honest, I'm actually pretty good at this game.

2327
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:06,040
I'm actually pretty good at this game when I actually play it, you know?

2328
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,320
How do you get it in the 50?

2329
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,140
I think I'm off a little bit.

2330
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:35,940
Thanks Freddy!

2331
01:54:41,110 --> 01:54:41,990
How do I get out?

2332
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:43,010
Exit.

2333
01:54:43,090 --> 01:54:43,790
Oh, E to exit.

2334
01:54:45,130 --> 01:54:46,470
Why is the music so...

2335
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:48,190
Complete all arcade games!

2336
01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:48,650
Oh!

2337
01:54:49,190 --> 01:54:49,970
Okay, nice!

2338
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:52,210
So, what about this one then?

2339
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:54,050
I don't have the right item for this cabinet.

2340
01:54:55,690 --> 01:54:56,930
This one wasn't one either?

2341
01:54:57,130 --> 01:54:59,030
Or there was... I thought one other one.

2342
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:01,130
I guess this one doesn't matter.

2343
01:55:01,170 --> 01:55:02,730
We don't care about it at all.

2344
01:55:04,410 --> 01:55:05,670
Have the voucher.

2345
01:55:06,010 --> 01:55:07,030
And this one...

2346
01:55:07,730 --> 01:55:08,530
Busted and broken.

2347
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:09,150
Bummer.

2348
01:55:09,330 --> 01:55:10,230
They were fun to play.

2349
01:55:11,670 --> 01:55:12,070
Hmm...

2350
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:41,530
Possessing the skee-ball machine to drive up your score does not count as being good.

2351
01:55:41,590 --> 01:55:41,930
No!

2352
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:43,030
I promise!

2353
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:47,490
I am actually pretty good at it when I play on the arcades, for real.

2354
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:53,410
Guys, this might be my last opportunity to play it.

2355
01:55:53,770 --> 01:55:55,230
This might be my last opportunity.

2356
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:57,450
The

2357
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:16,040
process...

2358
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:16,920
It's not that hard.

2359
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:18,340
You underestimate...

2360
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:23,980
You underestimate how... how difficult slide puzzles are for me!

2361
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:25,980
Hold on, I'm gonna go look up that one.

2362
01:56:26,380 --> 01:56:27,320
That one comment.

2363
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:30,560
David, it was yours, right?

2364
01:56:34,060 --> 01:56:34,700
Hold on.

2365
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:35,600
I'm gonna go look it up.

2366
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:37,320
I'm gonna go look it up.

2367
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:40,000
And see what you said.

2368
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,400
And how well you described it.

2369
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:42,720
Let's see.

2370
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:44,620
Um.

2371
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:49,120
I see it, I see it, I see it.

2372
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:49,260
Okay.

2373
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:53,220
Instead of thinking about getting a piece in a particular spot, think about everything in loops.

2374
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:54,920
See, that's what makes it more difficult for me.

2375
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,560
You have to change the controller port too.

2376
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:04,740
In a 3x3 puzzle, there's only nine possible loops.

2377
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:05,540
Oh gosh.

2378
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:06,780
Okay, I'm already getting confused.

2379
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:07,540
Okay.

2380
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:10,160
You're doing your best... to help me.

2381
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:11,300
Okay.

2382
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:11,440
Okay.

2383
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:13,880
No matter how many you slide in a loop, it'll stay the same.

2384
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:16,420
To make any changes in the puzzle, you need to switch between loops.

2385
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:17,920
Oh gosh.

2386
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:19,080
Oh god.

2387
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:24,520
I'm already confused.

2388
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:27,900
You explained it so nicely, David!

2389
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:29,640
And I'm dumb!

2390
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:31,040
I'm sorry!

2391
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:31,500
You're...

2392
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:33,060
I'm sorry!

2393
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:34,200
You wasted your time!

2394
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,480
You wasted your time!

2395
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:40,080
I'm stupid!

2396
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:42,880
Okay, hold on.

2397
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:45,580
I don't want the timer to go up needlessly, you know?

2398
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:51,770
Okay.

2399
01:57:54,710 --> 01:57:55,350
Oh

2400
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:05,930
gosh, I don't know.

2401
01:58:06,930 --> 01:58:08,630
I hate slide pipes!

2402
01:58:09,010 --> 01:58:12,230
I hate them!

2403
01:58:13,530 --> 01:58:14,710
With a passion!

2404
01:58:35,220 --> 01:58:36,820
Just brute force it!

2405
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:45,320
I'm gonna start crying, you guys.

2406
01:58:52,030 --> 01:58:52,470
That's it?

2407
01:58:52,570 --> 01:58:53,110
You got it?

2408
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:53,890
I do?

2409
01:58:55,370 --> 01:58:56,610
Wait, I almost have it.

2410
01:58:56,630 --> 01:58:57,050
What do you mean?

2411
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:02,220
What do you mean I had it?

2412
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,160
I'm so confused.

2413
01:59:16,030 --> 01:59:17,250
I'm a possessor PC.

2414
01:59:17,370 --> 01:59:18,070
Do it, please.

2415
01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:20,570
You're in the right direction.

2416
01:59:20,750 --> 01:59:23,130
I'm trying to mathematize a little bit.

2417
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:26,050
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

2418
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,200
But how then do I get this...

2419
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:34,420
It's so confusing!

2420
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:36,340
It doesn't make any sense to me!

2421
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:06,460
The top row and left column.

2422
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:08,880
I know people told me that before, but I don't...

2423
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:09,900
That's the problem.

2424
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:12,420
I don't even know how to solve the top row and the left column.

2425
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:17,040
Oh my gosh.

2426
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,700
I hate this.

2427
02:00:26,710 --> 02:00:28,470
It was my fault at explaining.

2428
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:29,010
No!

2429
02:00:29,510 --> 02:00:30,770
What are you talking about?

2430
02:00:30,890 --> 02:00:32,050
You explained it wonderfully!

2431
02:00:32,590 --> 02:00:34,490
I just don't know or understand numbers.

2432
02:00:35,730 --> 02:00:36,290
No!

2433
02:00:37,130 --> 02:00:37,690
Okay.

2434
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:44,220
If you solve the top row...

2435
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:45,640
But how do I get him in there?

2436
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:47,960
How do I smush him in there?

2437
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:53,880
Whiskers?

2438
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:54,760
Whiskers?

2439
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:54,800
Whiskers?

2440
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:55,640
Whiskers?

2441
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:56,760
Huh?

2442
02:00:58,560 --> 02:00:59,200
Huh?

2443
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:01,380
What's whiskers?

2444
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:02,120
This?

2445
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:02,760
This?

2446
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:03,100
This?

2447
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:04,180
What's a whiskers?

2448
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:15,660
How do I get him in there?

2449
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:22,420
I have to get...

2450
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:23,240
I have to get...

2451
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:28,660
I have to get this in front of...

2452
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:31,580
I don't understand how to...

2453
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:35,820
I don't understand...

2454
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:37,460
Oh...

2455
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:38,560
How

2456
02:01:41,650 --> 02:01:43,770
do I make him... get this in...

2457
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:47,070
God,

2458
02:02:02,020 --> 02:02:02,740
I love the ear.

2459
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:04,680
Yeah, I know.

2460
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:11,190
I need the ear.

2461
02:02:13,730 --> 02:02:14,690
Hold on.

2462
02:02:20,140 --> 02:02:21,160
I need the ear.

2463
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:23,800
Right?

2464
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:25,580
Because when I do this...

2465
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:26,540
It'll be...

2466
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:47,400
Wait, does it...

2467
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:48,640
Wait, I can't... I can't remember.

2468
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:51,620
Comito, put that brain into maximum overdrive.

2469
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:53,560
I can't remember.

2470
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:54,720
Wait, I can't remember if...

2471
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:58,640
If this needs to be... If I do it now...

2472
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:02,340
Wait...

2473
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:03,760
Like that?

2474
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:10,280
Or if it's backward.

2475
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:11,240
I can't remember.

2476
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:13,120
I can't remember.

2477
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:18,360
I guess we'll figure it out.

2478
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:20,300
Once we get here.

2479
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:25,060
Right?

2480
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:25,740
Oh, wait.

2481
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:27,360
Oh, wait.

2482
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:35,000
She's cooking.

2483
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:42,780
I'm going to have a heart attack.

2484
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:43,660
We failed our youth.

2485
02:03:43,720 --> 02:03:45,740
Hey, just because I didn't do...

2486
02:03:46,140 --> 02:03:47,220
Don't be mean, okay?

2487
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:48,020
Don't be mean.

2488
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:49,480
I've never understood these.

2489
02:03:56,630 --> 02:03:58,070
Yeah, we need a hole to rotate.

2490
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:09,660
I'm closing chat because you guys stress me out.

2491
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:22,220
I don't want to see mean comments.

2492
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:26,980
I don't...

2493
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:40,330
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2494
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:41,390
I think I... Oh, wait.

2495
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:43,610
Let's go the other way, maybe.

2496
02:04:45,890 --> 02:04:48,190
Actually, I can't tell if I just messed it up or not.

2497
02:04:48,350 --> 02:04:48,910
But you know what?

2498
02:04:48,930 --> 02:04:49,130
Whatever.

2499
02:04:53,770 --> 02:04:54,150
No!

2500
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:56,930
No!

2501
02:05:09,870 --> 02:05:10,550
No!

2502
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:16,790
Wait.

2503
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:30,900
Oh my god, we're so close!

2504
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:41,010
I can see his face.

2505
02:06:11,060 --> 02:06:12,640
Now, does it need to be...

2506
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:18,840
No, I messed it up again.

2507
02:06:26,750 --> 02:06:27,590
I think.

2508
02:06:28,010 --> 02:06:29,250
Okay, now...

2509
02:06:32,030 --> 02:06:34,870
No, I need the ear behind the thing.

2510
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:38,090
I need the ear behind this piece.

2511
02:06:38,170 --> 02:06:38,650
Right here.

2512
02:06:38,770 --> 02:06:39,250
This one.

2513
02:06:39,410 --> 02:06:40,370
The one I'm highlighting.

2514
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:07,340
How do I get it in front?

2515
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:22,670
There.

2516
02:07:23,270 --> 02:07:23,910
Okay.

2517
02:07:24,010 --> 02:07:24,330
Okay.

2518
02:07:25,470 --> 02:07:26,110
Okay.

2519
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:43,280
Okay.

2520
02:07:46,940 --> 02:07:47,260
Okay.

2521
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:48,360
Okay.

2522
02:07:50,380 --> 02:07:51,020
Okay.

2523
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:53,120
Okay.

2524
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:53,700
Okay.

2525
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:02,980
Close enough.

2526
02:08:04,160 --> 02:08:04,980
Okay, okay, okay.

2527
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:07,720
I hope there's not like a...

2528
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:09,580
You need to solve it by this time.

2529
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:11,100
You know?

2530
02:08:11,420 --> 02:08:12,820
That would be really unfortunate.

2531
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,940
This is the bottom left, right?

2532
02:08:16,140 --> 02:08:16,720
I think.

2533
02:08:23,290 --> 02:08:23,990
Like there.

2534
02:08:24,150 --> 02:08:25,290
And I think that's where that goes.

2535
02:08:26,890 --> 02:08:27,350
Oh.

2536
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:29,870
No.

2537
02:08:30,230 --> 02:08:30,690
Okay.

2538
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:39,140
Okay.

2539
02:08:39,140 --> 02:08:41,500
So now I should solve the left side, right?

2540
02:08:41,620 --> 02:08:42,000
Probably.

2541
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:43,920
Oh my gosh.

2542
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:45,280
Oh my gosh!

2543
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:46,440
We're so close!

2544
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:46,820
Oh

2545
02:08:50,010 --> 02:08:50,690
my gosh!

2546
02:08:50,690 --> 02:08:52,610
I just have it in the rungs of butt!

2547
02:09:21,350 --> 02:09:21,870
Wait.

2548
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:48,760
It wasn't worth it.

2549
02:09:51,220 --> 02:09:52,700
Slidy Pieces Puzzle.

2550
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:56,400
I got ten tickets for that.

2551
02:09:57,240 --> 02:09:57,560
Yeah!

2552
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:23,360
We did it!

2553
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,680
We did it!

2554
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:29,300
Oh my gosh.

2555
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:32,560
G-man, thanks for the ten gifted.

2556
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:33,780
McFerrick, thanks for the five gifted!

2557
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,440
Never doubted for a second.

2558
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:36,440
Congrats, Minto Gaming.

2559
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:37,080
Thank you.

2560
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:39,240
Alright.

2561
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:40,060
Go to the ball pit.

2562
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:43,180
Go to the ball pit.

2563
02:10:43,480 --> 02:10:44,680
Is there anything else?

2564
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:45,320
Like...

2565
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:46,740
No, I guess there wouldn't be any.

2566
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:48,120
GG.

2567
02:10:49,660 --> 02:10:50,880
Ducky, thanks for the five gifted!

2568
02:10:50,980 --> 02:10:51,620
Oh, sure!

2569
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,480
Thank you for the fifty gifted!

2570
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:53,760
Oh!

2571
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:54,460
Hey, kid.

2572
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:55,300
Shouldn't you be in school?

2573
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:56,560
Uh...

2574
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:57,060
Not today!

2575
02:10:57,820 --> 02:10:58,920
Puzzle solving tax.

2576
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:00,460
Okay.

2577
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:02,340
You know where to find me.

2578
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:04,060
Oh.

2579
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:06,000
Oh, so he is here.

2580
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:07,340
Okay.

2581
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:08,740
Now's my chance to get a head start.

2582
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:10,980
Funds for the fairy under the desk.

2583
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:12,280
Tell them they did a good job.

2584
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:17,870
Wait.

2585
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:18,610
Oh, my bad.

2586
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:19,770
I didn't mean to go up here.

2587
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:20,370
Um...

2588
02:11:21,650 --> 02:11:23,290
I wanted to go talk to Jeff again.

2589
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:26,410
Good job, fairy.

2590
02:11:26,790 --> 02:11:27,850
You can eat today.

2591
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:32,500
Here to pick up a pizza?

2592
02:11:32,660 --> 02:11:33,480
No, just hanging out.

2593
02:11:33,780 --> 02:11:34,280
Oh, okay.

2594
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:41,720
Oh my gosh.

2595
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:42,940
I feel so fulfilled.

2596
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:44,060
I feel...

2597
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:44,500
I feel...

2598
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:44,600
I feel...

2599
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:49,100
Oh, I feel so fulfilled.

2600
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:51,820
Back to the ball pit.

2601
02:11:56,260 --> 02:11:59,080
How is Springtrap in more than one place?

2602
02:11:59,200 --> 02:11:59,480
One...

2603
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:00,060
One...

2604
02:12:00,060 --> 02:12:01,380
How is he everywhere?

2605
02:12:08,230 --> 02:12:09,390
You gotta be kidding me.

2606
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:10,930
How many kids do they trap here?

2607
02:12:12,490 --> 02:12:13,010
Objective.

2608
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:14,610
Investigate the scream.

2609
02:12:14,950 --> 02:12:15,330
Okay.

2610
02:12:16,010 --> 02:12:16,770
We're going?

2611
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:18,270
We're investigating the scream?

2612
02:12:18,570 --> 02:12:19,030
I'm scared.

2613
02:12:22,130 --> 02:12:23,010
What is...

2614
02:12:23,010 --> 02:12:25,870
Oh, my God.

2615
02:12:25,890 --> 02:12:26,670
I saw the hand.

2616
02:12:26,870 --> 02:12:28,630
I saw the hand but I...

2617
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:30,930
wasn't sure.

2618
02:12:31,470 --> 02:12:33,890
I was like, oh, maybe that's an item I pick up.

2619
02:12:34,710 --> 02:12:35,490
Oh, my God.

2620
02:12:35,690 --> 02:12:37,570
I heard a door open though.

2621
02:12:40,430 --> 02:12:40,870
Oh.

2622
02:12:41,850 --> 02:12:42,670
There he is.

2623
02:12:42,690 --> 02:12:43,110
He's coming.

2624
02:12:45,350 --> 02:12:47,250
I got his achievement even for it.

2625
02:12:47,350 --> 02:12:47,630
Oh, hello.

2626
02:12:48,570 --> 02:12:49,010
He's here.

2627
02:12:50,270 --> 02:12:51,070
Hi Springtrap.

2628
02:12:56,020 --> 02:12:57,260
Where did the scream come from?

2629
02:12:57,320 --> 02:12:58,200
Maybe the front door?

2630
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:03,100
Just go to the entrance and check.

2631
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:07,320
Wait.

2632
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:08,400
Who else am I hearing now?

2633
02:13:12,380 --> 02:13:12,780
Wait.

2634
02:13:13,020 --> 02:13:14,320
That was Chica, wasn't it?

2635
02:13:14,900 --> 02:13:15,700
Hello Ms. Minto.

2636
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:17,220
Hope you don't get spooked today.

2637
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:17,980
Thank you.

2638
02:13:19,260 --> 02:13:22,220
Springtrap always comes back, but it's not specified at what time and place when.

2639
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:24,200
So clearly, all places at all times.

2640
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:26,980
I see.

2641
02:13:32,380 --> 02:13:35,100
I'm probably being overly cautious, but...

2642
02:13:40,940 --> 02:13:42,860
Being a little overly cautious.

2643
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:43,300
What's that?

2644
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:45,500
Is that a piece that I need?

2645
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:52,960
He always...

2646
02:13:54,440 --> 02:13:55,320
Brings back.

2647
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:00,920
Where did the scream come from?

2648
02:14:00,940 --> 02:14:02,600
The security maybe?

2649
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:04,660
I guess we'll figure it out.

2650
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:05,140
Hello!

2651
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:12,880
Why don't you take care of the children that you are like...

2652
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:16,540
Holding hostage and stuff instead of worrying about me?

2653
02:14:17,480 --> 02:14:20,740
I can't tell if like he's walking away if he'll notice me, you know what I mean?

2654
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:23,700
I guess we'll check it out here.

2655
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:27,640
Oh.

2656
02:14:27,780 --> 02:14:29,080
That was a thing that I needed.

2657
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:34,220
Oh my god!

2658
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:34,700
Oh my god!

2659
02:14:34,720 --> 02:14:35,260
I'm such an idiot!

2660
02:14:35,420 --> 02:14:36,400
Why did I do that?!

2661
02:14:36,940 --> 02:14:37,860
What's wrong with me?

2662
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:39,000
What's wrong with me, you guys?

2663
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:43,860
I keep thinking that you can hide behind the Freddy Fazbear.

2664
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:48,520
I keep thinking you can hide behind him.

2665
02:14:51,620 --> 02:14:52,800
But maybe that was good.

2666
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:54,800
Maybe they'll all run that way.

2667
02:14:57,740 --> 02:14:58,220
Oh!

2668
02:14:58,920 --> 02:14:59,400
Okay.

2669
02:15:02,970 --> 02:15:03,450
I did it!

2670
02:15:05,950 --> 02:15:06,730
I did it!

2671
02:15:07,570 --> 02:15:09,010
I didn't even know that...

2672
02:15:09,010 --> 02:15:10,570
Oh my god, there's so many puppets in there.

2673
02:15:15,470 --> 02:15:16,430
Uh-huh.

2674
02:15:21,230 --> 02:15:21,770
What's this?

2675
02:15:22,250 --> 02:15:23,250
Blah blah blah?

2676
02:15:26,950 --> 02:15:28,750
There's so many puppets in there.

2677
02:15:28,750 --> 02:15:30,170
Play some games in the arcade.

2678
02:15:30,570 --> 02:15:30,910
Okay.

2679
02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:33,110
Not every machine works, though.

2680
02:15:33,350 --> 02:15:34,550
This isn't livestream 2, Minto.

2681
02:15:34,650 --> 02:15:36,670
You can't hide behind the mascot cutouts.

2682
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:38,830
Maybe that's what I'm thinking of.

2683
02:15:40,290 --> 02:15:40,770
Here!

2684
02:15:40,770 --> 02:15:41,490
They're close!

2685
02:15:42,590 --> 02:15:43,070
What?

2686
02:15:43,150 --> 02:15:43,390
Who?

2687
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:45,750
The cameras.

2688
02:15:47,010 --> 02:15:47,490
What?

2689
02:15:48,190 --> 02:15:49,090
No, I can't.

2690
02:15:49,110 --> 02:15:49,530
The noise.

2691
02:15:50,070 --> 02:15:50,950
Wait, what do you mean?

2692
02:15:52,050 --> 02:15:53,470
Some batteries are in this locker.

2693
02:15:53,810 --> 02:15:54,290
Wait.

2694
02:15:54,710 --> 02:15:55,890
Objective, check the cameras.

2695
02:15:56,150 --> 02:15:56,350
Oh.

2696
02:15:58,990 --> 02:15:59,310
Oh!

2697
02:15:59,310 --> 02:15:59,530
Oh!

2698
02:16:00,370 --> 02:16:01,290
No, no, wait.

2699
02:16:01,430 --> 02:16:02,030
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

2700
02:16:02,210 --> 02:16:03,170
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2701
02:16:03,210 --> 02:16:04,670
No, it's becoming actual Freddy.

2702
02:16:04,810 --> 02:16:05,390
Oh my god.

2703
02:16:06,130 --> 02:16:06,670
No, no.

2704
02:16:07,070 --> 02:16:08,090
Wait, is my dad in here?

2705
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:12,680
Oh my god.

2706
02:16:12,920 --> 02:16:14,260
It's becoming actual Freddy.

2707
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:15,540
Five Nights at Freddy's.

2708
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:17,080
Oh my god.

2709
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:18,100
Oh my god.

2710
02:16:18,100 --> 02:16:18,760
No, no, no, no.

2711
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:20,860
Oh my god.

2712
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:21,640
No, no, no, no, no.

2713
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:25,500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2714
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:26,720
Whoa.

2715
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:27,780
They move really fast.

2716
02:16:33,180 --> 02:16:34,140
Oh my god.

2717
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:38,000
That actually launched me out of my chair.

2718
02:16:40,540 --> 02:16:42,360
There's a balloon boy on the camera now.

2719
02:16:42,620 --> 02:16:43,240
Oh my gosh.

2720
02:16:43,260 --> 02:16:47,080
That launch, I literally flinched back in my chair so bad.

2721
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:47,960
Follow me.

2722
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:48,960
We have to get out of here.

2723
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:50,840
No, I can't.

2724
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:51,660
They're still out there.

2725
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:54,560
I need to get them away from here.

2726
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:57,420
Oh my gosh.

2727
02:16:57,900 --> 02:17:01,000
I flinched so badly.

2728
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:04,120
I flinched so badly.

2729
02:17:04,340 --> 02:17:05,460
Oh my gosh.

2730
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:09,060
Um, distract the creature.

2731
02:17:09,820 --> 02:17:11,620
So it's a creature in the entrance.

2732
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:14,100
Gosh.

2733
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:17,280
Is there an item under that kid?

2734
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:19,160
It seems like there's something.

2735
02:17:19,340 --> 02:17:19,840
Oh, here.

2736
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:22,060
My dad's wedding ring.

2737
02:17:22,340 --> 02:17:23,700
I need to get him back to mom.

2738
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:25,960
Oh my god.

2739
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:26,080
Oh my god!

2740
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:29,880
That should be 4 out of 5, right?

2741
02:17:31,100 --> 02:17:32,220
If I can find it.

2742
02:17:32,420 --> 02:17:33,760
If I can find it.

2743
02:17:34,580 --> 02:17:35,000
Oh!

2744
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,020
5 out of 5!

2745
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:37,620
Okay, we're missing 4 out of 5.

2746
02:18:00,690 --> 02:18:02,630
I wish I could hide in the lockers.

2747
02:18:03,670 --> 02:18:06,590
I feel like you should be able to hide in the lockers, I'm just saying.

2748
02:18:08,710 --> 02:18:10,950
Okay, so here is... there's something in here?

2749
02:18:11,050 --> 02:18:11,570
In the entrance?

2750
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:12,350
Is that what it is?

2751
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:27,160
Why are the lights out in the arcade?

2752
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:32,950
Oh, and in here too?

2753
02:18:34,110 --> 02:18:35,010
What is going on?

2754
02:18:41,490 --> 02:18:42,330
It's so scary!

2755
02:18:45,690 --> 02:18:46,510
Ball pit.

2756
02:18:50,090 --> 02:18:51,130
Security room.

2757
02:18:51,730 --> 02:18:53,450
Or... storage room.

2758
02:18:56,330 --> 02:18:56,930
Okay.

2759
02:18:57,830 --> 02:19:00,750
Wait, wait, wait.

2760
02:19:01,170 --> 02:19:01,770
Guys?

2761
02:19:04,270 --> 02:19:05,910
Guys, my game is glitched?

2762
02:19:07,170 --> 02:19:08,590
Oswald, where have you gone?

2763
02:19:10,590 --> 02:19:11,610
I can't move!

2764
02:19:14,210 --> 02:19:15,710
Oh my god, no way!

2765
02:19:18,410 --> 02:19:21,600
No, no, no!

2766
02:19:21,800 --> 02:19:22,820
Wait, let me check the camera.

2767
02:19:22,900 --> 02:19:24,020
Oh, I can't even check the cameras.

2768
02:19:27,060 --> 02:19:27,940
No way!

2769
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:37,530
Did Freddy Fazbear just open that door?

2770
02:19:38,150 --> 02:19:39,310
And check the seat?

2771
02:19:39,390 --> 02:19:40,270
But I'm gone.

2772
02:19:41,570 --> 02:19:42,450
Because... wait.

2773
02:19:45,030 --> 02:19:46,970
Freddy just came in here to check on the situation?

2774
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:53,060
No way!

2775
02:19:57,180 --> 02:19:59,220
Are you soft locked, son?

2776
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:02,920
You literally...

2777
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:11,580
Okay, so it probably will have me go back to the...

2778
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:14,820
From here, I probably should be okay.

2779
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:17,400
Distract the creature, right?

2780
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:18,440
Probably?

2781
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:20,580
Alright, let's go to the title screen.

2782
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:42,600
Okay.

2783
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:43,720
Everyone loves our pizza.

2784
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:44,740
Especially Chica.

2785
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:45,840
Okay, okay, okay.

2786
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:47,140
We're back.

2787
02:20:49,240 --> 02:20:50,180
We're back, everyone.

2788
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:56,540
And, uh... Oswald, come in!

2789
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:57,040
Do you copy?

2790
02:20:57,560 --> 02:20:57,920
Oswald!

2791
02:20:59,020 --> 02:20:59,380
Oswald!

2792
02:21:01,340 --> 02:21:01,700
Okay.

2793
02:21:03,220 --> 02:21:07,120
I just want to look over this, just in case you get something for it.

2794
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:07,540
You know what I mean?

2795
02:21:07,540 --> 02:21:08,700
Oh, my bad.

2796
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:09,260
Okay, there we go.

2797
02:21:09,340 --> 02:21:09,820
Alrighty.

2798
02:21:14,290 --> 02:21:15,650
There's a fuse here.

2799
02:21:16,950 --> 02:21:20,830
So what do we do to distract the creature?

2800
02:21:23,310 --> 02:21:25,410
Is my thing...

2801
02:21:26,230 --> 02:21:27,770
Why don't we... Okay.

2802
02:21:28,030 --> 02:21:29,150
Other solution.

2803
02:21:29,470 --> 02:21:34,330
The kid climbs through the vent with us, and there's nothing here.

2804
02:21:37,430 --> 02:21:38,470
Better solution.

2805
02:21:38,790 --> 02:21:41,530
The kid just goes through the vent and leaves through the entrance.

2806
02:21:45,090 --> 02:21:45,870
Easy peasy.

2807
02:21:46,210 --> 02:21:47,030
I think.

2808
02:21:47,430 --> 02:21:47,990
Right?

2809
02:21:53,260 --> 02:21:54,160
Too big!

2810
02:21:54,600 --> 02:21:56,300
They're the same size as us!

2811
02:21:58,300 --> 02:21:59,200
Yeah, solution.

2812
02:21:59,320 --> 02:22:00,000
Just leave.

2813
02:22:04,070 --> 02:22:07,190
But I actually don't know what to do to distract the creature.

2814
02:22:07,770 --> 02:22:10,670
We need to get the creature away from the entrance?

2815
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:13,230
Right?

2816
02:22:13,230 --> 02:22:14,290
I'm not quite sure.

2817
02:22:14,670 --> 02:22:15,270
Let's see.

2818
02:22:15,450 --> 02:22:16,210
If I do this...

2819
02:22:20,370 --> 02:22:20,890
Oh!

2820
02:22:20,990 --> 02:22:22,110
Return to the security room!

2821
02:22:22,310 --> 02:22:22,830
Oh, okay.

2822
02:22:23,650 --> 02:22:24,470
That was it?

2823
02:22:28,650 --> 02:22:29,170
Okay.

2824
02:22:32,130 --> 02:22:32,650
What?

2825
02:22:33,910 --> 02:22:34,430
No!

2826
02:22:35,070 --> 02:22:35,610
Where'd she go?

2827
02:22:37,630 --> 02:22:38,630
Oh my god.

2828
02:22:39,230 --> 02:22:39,990
I hate.

2829
02:22:40,890 --> 02:22:41,630
I hate.

2830
02:22:45,910 --> 02:22:47,610
Do I check the cameras?

2831
02:22:47,870 --> 02:22:48,050
Okay.

2832
02:22:48,130 --> 02:22:48,310
Yeah.

2833
02:22:49,630 --> 02:22:50,030
Hello?

2834
02:22:50,110 --> 02:22:50,910
Are you in the ball pit?

2835
02:22:52,490 --> 02:22:53,290
Why not?

2836
02:22:54,530 --> 02:22:55,850
Wouldn't you want to be in the ball pit?

2837
02:22:56,010 --> 02:22:56,810
Not in storage.

2838
02:22:59,650 --> 02:23:00,710
Oh my god!

2839
02:23:00,770 --> 02:23:01,030
No!

2840
02:23:02,450 --> 02:23:02,850
No!

2841
02:23:02,890 --> 02:23:04,570
Where are you taking our springtrap?

2842
02:23:05,290 --> 02:23:06,190
Into the kitchen?

2843
02:23:08,950 --> 02:23:09,590
Okay.

2844
02:23:11,150 --> 02:23:12,670
Where is it taking her?

2845
02:23:13,570 --> 02:23:16,150
Look for the kid.

2846
02:23:22,120 --> 02:23:23,160
Oh shoot.

2847
02:23:23,220 --> 02:23:23,940
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

2848
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:28,680
Chica!

2849
02:23:30,700 --> 02:23:32,060
Let him cook!

2850
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:34,680
Chica, go away!

2851
02:23:35,180 --> 02:23:37,080
This girl is just like...

2852
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:37,380
Wah!

2853
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:39,020
Wah!

2854
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:40,200
Oh!

2855
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:44,820
Do I hear the phone ringing?

2856
02:23:44,980 --> 02:23:45,520
Am I crazy?

2857
02:23:47,420 --> 02:23:48,680
No, I think the phone is ringing.

2858
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:49,560
Stop camping!

2859
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:50,980
Seriously!

2860
02:23:51,180 --> 02:23:52,460
Stop camping, Chica!

2861
02:23:54,700 --> 02:23:56,040
This is messed up, actually.

2862
02:24:01,640 --> 02:24:02,580
Yeah, I hear the phone.

2863
02:24:03,220 --> 02:24:04,820
I don't know if I'll be able to get it, though.

2864
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:08,720
Oh, come on!

2865
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,240
Right as Chica leaves!

2866
02:24:10,940 --> 02:24:12,620
This is... this is unfair.

2867
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:14,240
This is unfair.

2868
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:18,460
Who else am I hearing?

2869
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:23,780
Literally as she opened the door.

2870
02:24:37,930 --> 02:24:39,650
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2871
02:24:39,690 --> 02:24:40,870
I just heard them open the door.

2872
02:24:42,750 --> 02:24:43,890
I know she's in here.

2873
02:24:44,410 --> 02:24:45,570
Are you in the fridge?

2874
02:24:46,190 --> 02:24:46,910
Won't budge.

2875
02:24:46,950 --> 02:24:48,090
The lock looks pretty old, though.

2876
02:24:48,210 --> 02:24:49,830
I bet I can find something to smash it?

2877
02:24:50,510 --> 02:24:52,990
I need to get that girl out before she freezes.

2878
02:24:55,010 --> 02:24:56,090
Or is she in the oven?

2879
02:24:56,350 --> 02:24:58,250
I feel like I could get swallowed whole by the oven.

2880
02:24:58,350 --> 02:24:59,970
Okay, find a way to open the freezer.

2881
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:05,240
What is this?

2882
02:25:05,420 --> 02:25:05,680
Wait.

2883
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:07,520
25 cents for candy?

2884
02:25:07,700 --> 02:25:09,180
I could eat candy for the rest of my life!

2885
02:25:09,620 --> 02:25:10,760
Mom wouldn't like that, though.

2886
02:25:13,940 --> 02:25:17,040
Find a way to open the freezer.

2887
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:20,560
Something to smash the freezer with.

2888
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:24,000
I think we should... maybe leave.

2889
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:29,580
And maybe I find something in my own time.

2890
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:31,440
Like in the present.

2891
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:34,680
Maybe.

2892
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:41,340
Hmm.

2893
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:44,900
But also, we got one more thing.

2894
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:46,860
We got the ticket thing.

2895
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:53,540
Here.

2896
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:56,260
Was there a hammer in the arcade?

2897
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:56,940
Oh, was there?

2898
02:25:59,580 --> 02:26:01,140
Because we have... we got this.

2899
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:02,780
To fix the ticket counter.

2900
02:26:04,620 --> 02:26:05,580
Ohio... oh, whoops.

2901
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:05,980
My bad.

2902
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:06,560
No, no, no, no.

2903
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:07,360
Get out of here.

2904
02:26:08,360 --> 02:26:08,960
This one.

2905
02:26:09,300 --> 02:26:10,040
We got...

2906
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:12,380
Ohio, enjoy your welcome to membership.

2907
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:13,020
Thank you!

2908
02:26:14,900 --> 02:26:16,320
Fix all arcade cabinets!

2909
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:16,940
Yippee!

2910
02:26:17,420 --> 02:26:17,820
Okay.

2911
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:19,520
Oh, hi, Jeff.

2912
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:22,080
Hey, kid.

2913
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:24,300
Been noticing you tinkering around with these old machines.

2914
02:26:24,660 --> 02:26:27,300
I don't mind, but... wait, did you fix all of them?

2915
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:29,980
Where'd you learn to do that?

2916
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:31,000
My dad.

2917
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:32,160
He's pretty good with machines.

2918
02:26:35,820 --> 02:26:38,240
He repaired all the equipment at the mill when he worked there.

2919
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:40,880
Sometimes he'd sneak me in during summer so I could watch.

2920
02:26:41,420 --> 02:26:41,820
Wow.

2921
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:42,980
I don't really know what to say.

2922
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:45,740
I've been letting this place go for quite a while now.

2923
02:26:45,940 --> 02:26:48,140
Maybe it's time I fixed things up around here, too.

2924
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:51,200
Oh my gosh, Jeff is turning over a new leaf!

2925
02:26:51,480 --> 02:26:53,600
The red button in security was interactable.

2926
02:26:53,780 --> 02:26:54,760
Does that do anything?

2927
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:55,920
Yes, it's an alarm.

2928
02:26:58,180 --> 02:27:00,420
It will... it will make a loud sound.

2929
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:02,400
Yeah.

2930
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:04,880
Thanks for your hard work, Oswald.

2931
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:06,100
Here, take this.

2932
02:27:06,860 --> 02:27:09,120
Don't worry about the expiration date.

2933
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:10,520
Oh, wow.

2934
02:27:10,620 --> 02:27:11,240
Thanks, Jeff.

2935
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:11,720
It's...

2936
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:13,800
75 cents off.

2937
02:27:14,900 --> 02:27:16,300
Least I could do for you.

2938
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:18,040
What a deal.

2939
02:27:18,740 --> 02:27:20,060
Oh, I got a pizza coupon.

2940
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:20,960
It's in my inventory.

2941
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:25,360
It's actually in my... somewhere in here.

2942
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:28,520
We have to find the 4 out of 5 also.

2943
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:30,300
We have... just missing one more.

2944
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:33,640
Where is it?

2945
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:35,120
Where could it be?

2946
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:37,280
Where could it be?

2947
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:40,420
This is so scuffed.

2948
02:27:40,980 --> 02:27:41,940
Where's my...

2949
02:27:43,140 --> 02:27:44,220
Where's... sketchbook?

2950
02:27:44,360 --> 02:27:44,780
Stretching...

2951
02:27:45,380 --> 02:27:47,280
Token, battery, tickets, phone...

2952
02:27:51,140 --> 02:27:52,820
It said it was in my inventory!

2953
02:27:55,400 --> 02:27:56,840
Why is your inventory blank?

2954
02:27:56,980 --> 02:27:59,060
Because it's... it's... it's glitched.

2955
02:27:59,900 --> 02:28:01,240
So I can't see anything.

2956
02:28:04,060 --> 02:28:05,740
Check the sketchbook, last page.

2957
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:07,300
Oh, you think it's in there?

2958
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:10,200
Oh, thank you.

2959
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:12,200
Save 75 cents on large pizza.

2960
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:13,660
Only pizza in town.

2961
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:16,620
Jeff's Pizza.

2962
02:28:16,840 --> 02:28:17,400
Okay, okay.

2963
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:17,960
Thank you.

2964
02:28:18,020 --> 02:28:19,220
Otherwise I would have been like, hello?

2965
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:20,300
Excuse me?

2966
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:21,060
Hello?

2967
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:23,760
Oh wait, we have... we can now use it.

2968
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:24,360
We have tickets.

2969
02:28:29,170 --> 02:28:30,210
89 of them?

2970
02:28:31,030 --> 02:28:33,030
Looks like I have enough for a prize voucher.

2971
02:28:34,030 --> 02:28:34,450
Nice.

2972
02:28:36,270 --> 02:28:38,010
And this does work now, right?

2973
02:28:41,130 --> 02:28:41,550
Voucher?

2974
02:28:42,370 --> 02:28:45,610
Looks like I got some sort of old game thing.

2975
02:28:46,510 --> 02:28:47,870
I can barely see the screen.

2976
02:28:48,130 --> 02:28:49,330
Who would have won something like this?

2977
02:28:50,290 --> 02:28:51,350
Handheld gaming device?

2978
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:03,020
Prize voucher?

2979
02:29:03,660 --> 02:29:05,820
Okay, so 20 tickets is a prize voucher.

2980
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:10,520
Let's just use all of them.

2981
02:29:10,660 --> 02:29:11,740
How many do I have left?

2982
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:14,060
Nine, okay.

2983
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:21,780
Got some sign of sticker.

2984
02:29:22,120 --> 02:29:25,480
Guess my sketchbook is as good as any place for it.

2985
02:29:25,480 --> 02:29:26,160
Oh, okay.

2986
02:29:26,900 --> 02:29:27,920
Wait, I want to see it.

2987
02:29:28,580 --> 02:29:29,980
Oh, your sketchbook now?

2988
02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:31,420
For you?

2989
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:36,820
It's kind of cute.

2990
02:29:37,420 --> 02:29:38,280
It's kind of cute.

2991
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:39,260
I'll take it.

2992
02:29:43,030 --> 02:29:43,810
I'll take it.

2993
02:29:43,890 --> 02:29:45,550
Do I need to play more games, you think?

2994
02:29:49,710 --> 02:29:50,430
Another sticker?

2995
02:29:50,750 --> 02:29:52,250
How many stickers are in this thing?

2996
02:29:53,570 --> 02:29:54,330
What's that one?

2997
02:29:57,190 --> 02:29:58,770
Oh, that one's so cute!

2998
02:29:59,650 --> 02:30:00,710
I love the Bonnie one!

2999
02:30:00,870 --> 02:30:01,930
I love that one!

3000
02:30:04,010 --> 02:30:05,190
That one's so cute.

3001
02:30:06,250 --> 02:30:06,770
Okay.

3002
02:30:07,710 --> 02:30:08,230
Voucher.

3003
02:30:08,450 --> 02:30:09,510
My third sticker.

3004
02:30:09,830 --> 02:30:11,650
I guess that makes me a collector now.

3005
02:30:12,450 --> 02:30:13,490
Oh, I'm sorry.

3006
02:30:13,610 --> 02:30:14,790
There's not a...

3007
02:30:16,890 --> 02:30:18,530
There's not an achievement for...

3008
02:30:18,530 --> 02:30:20,230
Oh my god, the Freddy one's so cute!

3009
02:30:21,850 --> 02:30:24,750
There's not an achievement for getting all the stickers.

3010
02:30:24,890 --> 02:30:25,670
It's kind of messed up.

3011
02:30:27,250 --> 02:30:29,710
Why isn't Foxy in this game, I wonder?

3012
02:30:32,310 --> 02:30:35,190
Boasts a 30-minute battery life on six batteries.

3013
02:30:35,390 --> 02:30:35,910
Tradable...

3014
02:30:35,910 --> 02:30:36,890
A tradable item.

3015
02:30:40,810 --> 02:30:41,390
Huh.

3016
02:30:42,610 --> 02:30:44,130
Okay, so we need to...

3017
02:30:44,710 --> 02:30:45,950
Is there anything else in here?

3018
02:30:46,850 --> 02:30:48,850
That rocket ship looks so cool.

3019
02:30:49,350 --> 02:30:49,930
Hmm.

3020
02:30:52,610 --> 02:30:54,710
We just keep doing the slide puzzle.

3021
02:30:55,650 --> 02:30:56,890
Which one's this one?

3022
02:30:57,830 --> 02:30:58,950
Oh, collect the hats.

3023
02:31:00,190 --> 02:31:01,170
I don't like this one.

3024
02:31:01,510 --> 02:31:02,470
Let's do another one.

3025
02:31:04,970 --> 02:31:05,970
Oh, sorry guys.

3026
02:31:06,310 --> 02:31:06,530
Ew.

3027
02:31:06,670 --> 02:31:09,310
Why does Chica look so creepy in the menu?

3028
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:11,710
Rescue the children?

3029
02:31:12,030 --> 02:31:12,990
Oh, I hate this one too.

3030
02:31:13,090 --> 02:31:13,630
Never mind.

3031
02:31:13,750 --> 02:31:14,390
I don't want that one.

3032
02:31:14,550 --> 02:31:15,210
That one's scary.

3033
02:31:15,310 --> 02:31:16,190
That one stresses me out.

3034
02:31:18,850 --> 02:31:19,550
What's this one?

3035
02:31:21,710 --> 02:31:22,470
Hefton with...

3036
02:31:22,470 --> 02:31:23,470
Help please.

3037
02:31:23,950 --> 02:31:24,690
Oh, that's right!

3038
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:39,780
Game over.

3039
02:31:39,860 --> 02:31:41,760
What's the highest you've seen someone get on this?

3040
02:31:44,060 --> 02:31:45,360
Oh, we got 11 tickets.

3041
02:31:45,580 --> 02:31:46,280
Okay, this one's good.

3042
02:31:46,380 --> 02:31:46,820
This one's good.

3043
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:47,220
This one's good.

3044
02:31:47,240 --> 02:31:48,340
Because it's fast and it's easy.

3045
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:49,540
You know?

3046
02:31:50,620 --> 02:31:51,020
20?

3047
02:31:52,600 --> 02:31:53,740
I think 15.

3048
02:31:54,520 --> 02:31:55,280
Without cheating?

3049
02:31:55,400 --> 02:31:56,060
Yeah, without cheating.

3050
02:32:00,720 --> 02:32:01,120
Legit.

3051
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:01,420
Legit.

3052
02:32:01,460 --> 02:32:01,720
Legit.

3053
02:32:01,740 --> 02:32:02,380
Not breaking it.

3054
02:32:08,910 --> 02:32:09,310
16.

3055
02:32:09,470 --> 02:32:10,630
How the hell?

3056
02:32:10,910 --> 02:32:11,310
Okay.

3057
02:32:14,820 --> 02:32:15,220
Okay.

3058
02:32:15,220 --> 02:32:16,180
Prize voucher.

3059
02:32:27,510 --> 02:32:28,070
Huh?

3060
02:32:29,290 --> 02:32:30,070
No more?

3061
02:32:31,890 --> 02:32:32,610
Wait, what?

3062
02:32:35,390 --> 02:32:37,070
Did I eat my voucher?

3063
02:32:50,270 --> 02:32:52,150
So can I not get any more?

3064
02:32:52,890 --> 02:32:53,590
Hold on.

3065
02:32:54,210 --> 02:32:55,290
Let's try...

3066
02:32:55,290 --> 02:32:56,770
It was help please.

3067
02:32:56,930 --> 02:32:57,810
There was this one again.

3068
02:33:05,300 --> 02:33:08,340
Don't even think about using auto fire.

3069
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:10,440
Oh no.

3070
02:33:10,460 --> 02:33:10,900
Oh no.

3071
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:13,920
I'm too weak today.

3072
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:15,880
I can't be my best.

3073
02:33:16,220 --> 02:33:17,160
I'm too weak.

3074
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:17,860
I'm too weak.

3075
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:28,500
What else can we do?

3076
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:29,260
What's this one again?

3077
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:32,080
Deliver the pizza.

3078
02:33:32,180 --> 02:33:32,360
Oh!

3079
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:33,220
This is the Frogger.

3080
02:33:54,080 --> 02:33:54,940
I hate that.

3081
02:33:54,980 --> 02:33:58,460
I wish I could just like hold it down sometimes.

3082
02:34:03,990 --> 02:34:04,590
This one's just...

3083
02:34:04,590 --> 02:34:06,770
This one is really just until how I want to go.

3084
02:34:06,870 --> 02:34:07,750
How long I want to go.

3085
02:34:08,610 --> 02:34:09,330
So maybe...

3086
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:12,430
I won't get an optimal amount of...

3087
02:34:13,590 --> 02:34:14,510
tickets, you know?

3088
02:34:14,750 --> 02:34:15,850
Let's see how many we get.

3089
02:34:19,150 --> 02:34:21,770
I do like that there's the mini-games in this though, you know?

3090
02:34:21,830 --> 02:34:22,270
It's fun.

3091
02:34:23,930 --> 02:34:24,710
It's pretty fun.

3092
02:34:27,890 --> 02:34:28,910
I like it.

3093
02:34:35,670 --> 02:34:38,650
I don't want to go too far because I just want to get the tickets and go.

3094
02:34:40,630 --> 02:34:41,850
Does this one give tickets?

3095
02:34:42,170 --> 02:34:43,110
It should, right?

3096
02:34:43,410 --> 02:34:44,790
Wait, does this one not give tickets?

3097
02:34:45,610 --> 02:34:46,310
We'll find out.

3098
02:34:50,050 --> 02:34:50,930
I got...

3099
02:34:51,610 --> 02:34:53,170
only three tickets!

3100
02:34:54,750 --> 02:34:55,830
This game sucks!

3101
02:34:57,170 --> 02:34:58,870
Redeem it in the past for something, I think.

3102
02:34:58,970 --> 02:34:59,170
Maybe?

3103
02:34:59,770 --> 02:35:01,410
Oh no, I hate this one too.

3104
02:35:14,410 --> 02:35:15,750
Fast Food Invader.

3105
02:35:17,190 --> 02:35:18,350
Oh, oh, this one.

3106
02:35:18,750 --> 02:35:19,630
This one was kind of fun though.

3107
02:35:23,110 --> 02:35:26,130
Oh, but I hate that I have to continuously press space.

3108
02:35:29,670 --> 02:35:31,130
Like, I can't hold down space.

3109
02:35:32,390 --> 02:35:34,590
Which seems very inefficient, you know?

3110
02:35:34,710 --> 02:35:35,390
I don't know.

3111
02:35:37,370 --> 02:35:40,030
Don't even think about using auto-fire.

3112
02:35:54,460 --> 02:35:55,420
Oh, oopsie.

3113
02:35:55,780 --> 02:35:56,940
Sorry, I was reading chat.

3114
02:35:59,640 --> 02:36:00,260
How many?

3115
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:02,240
Oh, I only got two tickets out of that one!

3116
02:36:02,480 --> 02:36:03,380
Okay, help you...

3117
02:36:03,380 --> 02:36:03,680
Help...

3118
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:05,080
Help...

3119
02:36:05,080 --> 02:36:06,600
Help Ulysses is the best one.

3120
02:36:07,140 --> 02:36:08,440
Tell everyone you know.

3121
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:09,700
If you're trying to...

3122
02:36:10,460 --> 02:36:14,000
If you're trying to get more tickets, Help Ulysses is the best bang!

3123
02:36:14,900 --> 02:36:15,340
For...

3124
02:36:16,360 --> 02:36:16,800
Your...

3125
02:36:17,240 --> 02:36:17,680
Bu...

3126
02:36:28,650 --> 02:36:31,090
Because it gives you as many tickets as you score.

3127
02:36:36,990 --> 02:36:39,710
I wonder if I could download an auto-clicker right now.

3128
02:36:49,560 --> 02:36:50,120
Okay...

3129
02:36:53,090 --> 02:36:53,850
One more.

3130
02:36:57,650 --> 02:37:02,090
Yeah, I have an auto-clicker on my normal computer for a cookie clicker.

3131
02:37:10,060 --> 02:37:10,620
Okay...

3132
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:11,800
Oh my god.

3133
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:14,600
My hands hurt.

3134
02:37:15,420 --> 02:37:15,980
Okay.

3135
02:37:17,480 --> 02:37:20,940
I can't tell if it's gonna scam us again or not.

3136
02:37:30,990 --> 02:37:31,350
Okay.

3137
02:37:31,350 --> 02:37:32,010
Let's try it.

3138
02:37:41,780 --> 02:37:43,780
It's actually... It's a scam!

3139
02:37:44,040 --> 02:37:44,500
It's a scam!

3140
02:37:44,620 --> 02:37:45,120
It's a scam!

3141
02:37:45,180 --> 02:37:45,660
It's a scam!

3142
02:37:45,700 --> 02:37:46,220
It's a scam!

3143
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:46,760
It's a scam!

3144
02:37:46,840 --> 02:37:47,220
It's a scam!

3145
02:37:47,220 --> 02:37:47,300
It's a scam!

3146
02:37:47,420 --> 02:37:47,780
It's a scam!

3147
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:53,240
Hey, can I get my vouchers back?

3148
02:37:56,280 --> 02:37:58,240
Wait, so do I actually have to...

3149
02:37:59,860 --> 02:38:01,600
I should probably... Okay, hold on.

3150
02:38:02,980 --> 02:38:04,200
I only have... What?

3151
02:38:04,260 --> 02:38:05,380
How many vouchers do I have?

3152
02:38:08,700 --> 02:38:09,520
I don't know.

3153
02:38:09,540 --> 02:38:10,160
We'll never know.

3154
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:11,320
Oh!

3155
02:38:11,320 --> 02:38:12,280
Oh, I don't know.

3156
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:15,840
A voucher to get a handheld gaming console from the prize machine.

3157
02:38:18,780 --> 02:38:19,800
I have two?

3158
02:38:22,140 --> 02:38:24,480
Okay, let's go to the past and try it.

3159
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:27,260
I suppose.

3160
02:38:29,580 --> 02:38:30,640
Oh, wrong room.

3161
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:34,180
Two should be enough.

3162
02:38:35,380 --> 02:38:35,860
Probably.

3163
02:38:36,220 --> 02:38:38,420
But also, I have this tradable item.

3164
02:38:38,560 --> 02:38:39,680
I wonder what we trade it for.

3165
02:38:40,780 --> 02:38:41,260
Unless...

3166
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:42,340
Hold on.

3167
02:38:42,580 --> 02:38:43,740
Before I do this...

3168
02:38:43,740 --> 02:38:47,520
Let's go to... Let's go to Firecracker Kid and see what he's got.

3169
02:38:48,460 --> 02:38:49,780
Maybe I'll get another Firecracker Kid.

3170
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:54,160
Maybe I'll get another Firecracker.

3171
02:38:56,800 --> 02:38:57,780
Maybe I'll get another Firecracker.

3172
02:38:59,340 --> 02:39:01,800
Or... Or, or, or, or, or...

3173
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:02,940
Oh wait, he's not there, is he?

3174
02:39:04,540 --> 02:39:05,700
He's only there after school.

3175
02:39:06,980 --> 02:39:08,600
Or, or, or, or...

3176
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:10,040
You can repair the rest of the machines?

3177
02:39:10,320 --> 02:39:11,240
I repaired all of them!

3178
02:39:11,260 --> 02:39:12,420
I got an achievement for it!

3179
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:16,000
Yeah, he's not here.

3180
02:39:17,100 --> 02:39:22,110
Or, or, or, or, or, or...

3181
02:39:22,130 --> 02:39:23,010
Okay, I'll stop stalling.

3182
02:39:24,470 --> 02:39:25,770
Or, or, or,

3183
02:39:35,080 --> 02:39:36,980
or, or, or, or, or...

3184
02:39:40,750 --> 02:39:45,690
I can't say whore because I think my stream will get age-restricted, maybe.

3185
02:39:54,240 --> 02:39:54,960
Okie dokie.

3186
02:39:59,620 --> 02:40:00,340
Okie dokie.

3187
02:40:00,440 --> 02:40:00,940
Let's go.

3188
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:05,080
So, to the arcade.

3189
02:40:08,810 --> 02:40:09,290
What?

3190
02:40:12,830 --> 02:40:13,790
Let's go to the...

3191
02:40:14,530 --> 02:40:16,970
I can't remember what doors work and what don't.

3192
02:40:17,010 --> 02:40:20,190
Let's just go to the basement and go through the vent.

3193
02:40:21,550 --> 02:40:21,930
Excuse me?

3194
02:40:25,830 --> 02:40:26,790
He's not in here, is he?

3195
02:40:35,390 --> 02:40:35,770
Hammer.

3196
02:40:36,010 --> 02:40:37,070
Yeah, what about the ham...

3197
02:40:37,070 --> 02:40:37,470
What do you mean?

3198
02:40:37,570 --> 02:40:38,190
Wait, I'm confused.

3199
02:40:39,650 --> 02:40:40,470
What do you guys mean?

3200
02:40:40,950 --> 02:40:44,370
Is the hammer not in the prize machine in the past?

3201
02:40:45,310 --> 02:40:46,910
The hammer is in the arcade, is it not?

3202
02:40:49,130 --> 02:40:50,370
But it's in the past, right?

3203
02:40:56,560 --> 02:40:58,060
Yeah, the one hitting the kid!

3204
02:40:58,320 --> 02:41:00,320
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

3205
02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:02,360
Okay, stop.

3206
02:41:03,160 --> 02:41:04,340
Okay, we're good, we're good.

3207
02:41:13,150 --> 02:41:15,830
Wait, was there a hammer in the present?

3208
02:41:16,230 --> 02:41:17,050
I'm so confused.

3209
02:41:18,790 --> 02:41:20,330
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused.

3210
02:41:20,370 --> 02:41:21,550
There's a hammer in the present too?

3211
02:41:22,050 --> 02:41:22,370
Really?

3212
02:41:23,030 --> 02:41:24,290
Okay, let's go check real quick.

3213
02:41:27,150 --> 02:41:28,210
Let's go check real quick.

3214
02:41:29,390 --> 02:41:30,550
Wee woo raid.

3215
02:41:31,910 --> 02:41:32,410
Wee woo.

3216
02:41:33,470 --> 02:41:34,010
Thank you.

3217
02:41:34,010 --> 02:41:35,890
I didn't see a raid notification, but thank you!

3218
02:41:36,550 --> 02:41:37,350
Thanks for the raid!

3219
02:41:39,190 --> 02:41:40,610
I don't know who it is, but thank you!

3220
02:41:44,110 --> 02:41:44,830
There is!

3221
02:41:46,110 --> 02:41:46,470
Broken.

3222
02:41:47,170 --> 02:41:48,890
And it would have been just when I was looking for it.

3223
02:41:49,650 --> 02:41:50,010
Okay.

3224
02:41:51,650 --> 02:41:53,050
So, you guys were correct.

3225
02:41:53,150 --> 02:41:54,210
It technically is here.

3226
02:41:55,410 --> 02:41:57,430
But we must grab it in the past.

3227
02:42:01,150 --> 02:42:03,010
We must grab it in the past.

3228
02:42:06,630 --> 02:42:07,070
Okay.

3229
02:42:07,190 --> 02:42:08,190
No, now we know.

3230
02:42:08,290 --> 02:42:08,670
Now we know.

3231
02:42:14,310 --> 02:42:16,570
And Springtrap might have left by now, so that's good.

3232
02:42:32,590 --> 02:42:33,770
Let's go back here.

3233
02:42:35,010 --> 02:42:36,490
We're gonna go through the basement.

3234
02:42:40,500 --> 02:42:42,620
So I can check and see if we're safe in there.

3235
02:42:43,940 --> 02:42:44,600
Oh my god.

3236
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:45,940
What am I hearing?

3237
02:42:46,320 --> 02:42:46,900
What was that?

3238
02:42:47,440 --> 02:42:48,480
What the hell did I just hear?

3239
02:42:48,620 --> 02:42:49,820
What the hell did I just hear?

3240
02:42:51,860 --> 02:42:52,220
What?

3241
02:42:54,040 --> 02:42:54,760
What was that?

3242
02:42:56,120 --> 02:42:57,160
What did I just hear?

3243
02:43:02,220 --> 02:43:03,400
The kid's still crying.

3244
02:43:07,380 --> 02:43:07,900
Uh-oh.

3245
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:08,300
Wait.

3246
02:43:09,020 --> 02:43:09,600
Oh my god.

3247
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:10,820
Chica, Chica, Chica, Chica, Chica, Chica!

3248
02:43:10,900 --> 02:43:11,280
Ah!

3249
02:43:18,870 --> 02:43:19,270
Hide!

3250
02:43:19,730 --> 02:43:20,430
Get in there!

3251
02:43:20,850 --> 02:43:21,250
Eyeswalled!

3252
02:43:25,380 --> 02:43:26,020
Oh my god.

3253
02:43:26,060 --> 02:43:26,660
Swat the spiders.

3254
02:43:26,820 --> 02:43:27,520
What are you talking about?

3255
02:43:29,380 --> 02:43:29,780
S...

3256
02:43:32,040 --> 02:43:32,440
A...

3257
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:33,600
D...

3258
02:43:36,910 --> 02:43:37,890
That's not wise, dude.

3259
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:42,090
Hey, I have spiders.

3260
02:43:42,450 --> 02:43:42,850
Hey, I have spiders.

3261
02:43:44,430 --> 02:43:45,370
Hey, I have spiders.

3262
02:43:46,050 --> 02:43:46,450
Hey, I have spiders.

3263
02:43:46,450 --> 02:43:47,130
Oh my gosh.

3264
02:43:50,070 --> 02:43:50,510
Don't.

3265
02:43:53,790 --> 02:43:55,750
Yeah, I know you're gonna go that way instead.

3266
02:43:56,990 --> 02:43:57,750
Yeah, exactly.

3267
02:43:59,530 --> 02:43:59,970
Okay.

3268
02:44:00,430 --> 02:44:01,370
Who just came in?

3269
02:44:03,470 --> 02:44:03,910
Anybody?

3270
02:44:04,250 --> 02:44:05,270
Who just came in?

3271
02:44:05,650 --> 02:44:06,290
Oh my god.

3272
02:44:06,310 --> 02:44:06,430
Chica.

3273
02:44:06,630 --> 02:44:07,070
Oh!

3274
02:44:07,290 --> 02:44:08,010
Oh my god.

3275
02:44:08,050 --> 02:44:08,270
Chica.

3276
02:44:08,790 --> 02:44:09,670
Please leave.

3277
02:44:14,430 --> 02:44:15,310
But go...

3278
02:44:15,310 --> 02:44:16,570
Not that way.

3279
02:44:16,690 --> 02:44:17,670
Go to the right.

3280
02:44:17,770 --> 02:44:17,990
Okay.

3281
02:44:19,350 --> 02:44:20,610
Chica, please stop camping.

3282
02:44:25,420 --> 02:44:26,620
Where does this go to?

3283
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:27,260
Oh, the storage.

3284
02:44:27,340 --> 02:44:27,660
That's right.

3285
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:29,560
I guess I could technically...

3286
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:30,880
Okay.

3287
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:32,760
Oh gosh.

3288
02:44:36,380 --> 02:44:37,700
All right, let's grab the hammer.

3289
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:43,320
That's a big hammer.

3290
02:44:44,220 --> 02:44:45,320
Put it in my hammer space.

3291
02:44:47,220 --> 02:44:47,700
Hammer.

3292
02:44:47,820 --> 02:44:48,780
Perfect for smashing.

3293
02:44:49,380 --> 02:44:52,360
Yeah, I'll just smash the animatronics.

3294
02:44:52,360 --> 02:44:52,840
Okay.

3295
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:54,360
What is this?

3296
02:44:54,360 --> 02:44:55,300
Well, let me do this, I wonder.

3297
02:44:57,260 --> 02:44:57,700
What the?

3298
02:44:57,880 --> 02:44:58,800
Pick up the balloons?

3299
02:44:59,060 --> 02:44:59,860
Wait, this is a game?

3300
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:03,560
Ew.

3301
02:45:03,740 --> 02:45:04,760
Wait, why is it...

3302
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:06,600
Why is it move like this?

3303
02:45:08,260 --> 02:45:09,460
What the hell is this game?

3304
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:09,940
Huh?

3305
02:45:10,560 --> 02:45:12,340
Wait, why is there a game on the vending machine?

3306
02:45:13,900 --> 02:45:15,340
Why do I sound like SpongeBob?

3307
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:19,480
What is this?

3308
02:45:28,690 --> 02:45:29,830
Oh, I don't have to smash.

3309
02:45:29,870 --> 02:45:30,730
It's a spam it.

3310
02:45:30,830 --> 02:45:30,990
Okay.

3311
02:45:35,620 --> 02:45:36,980
How many balloons are there?

3312
02:45:40,140 --> 02:45:40,620
Oh.

3313
02:45:40,980 --> 02:45:42,120
There's nothing in this room?

3314
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:44,480
Okay.

3315
02:45:44,540 --> 02:45:45,560
Secret minigame.

3316
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:47,040
Interesting.

3317
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:49,680
Four?

3318
02:45:51,740 --> 02:45:52,220
Four.

3319
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:52,600
Four.

3320
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:52,960
Four.

3321
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:53,620
Four.

3322
02:45:53,700 --> 02:45:54,180
Four.

3323
02:45:54,180 --> 02:45:54,560
Four.

3324
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:54,780
Four.

3325
02:45:54,960 --> 02:45:55,160
Four.

3326
02:45:55,540 --> 02:45:56,020
Four.

3327
02:45:56,300 --> 02:45:56,780
Four.

3328
02:45:56,780 --> 02:45:57,040
Four.

3329
02:45:57,260 --> 02:45:57,440
Four.

3330
02:45:58,260 --> 02:45:58,740
Four.

3331
02:45:59,000 --> 02:45:59,300
Four.

3332
02:45:59,520 --> 02:45:59,640
Four.

3333
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:00,220
Four.

3334
02:46:02,080 --> 02:46:02,560
Four.

3335
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:11,740
4x4 4x4 4x4 4x4 4x4 4x4 4x4 It does sound like Spongebob.

3336
02:46:11,820 --> 02:46:12,440
It does, right?

3337
02:46:13,300 --> 02:46:13,960
Oh, oh gosh.

3338
02:46:14,120 --> 02:46:14,400
Wait!

3339
02:46:14,500 --> 02:46:14,660
Oof.

3340
02:46:14,660 --> 02:46:16,440
The eye is on Golden Freddy.

3341
02:46:19,360 --> 02:46:28,080
4x4 4x4 4x4 4x4 4x4 4x4 4x4 4x4 Four...

3342
02:46:30,300 --> 02:46:30,860
Six?

3343
02:46:31,160 --> 02:46:32,260
Why is it turned purple?

3344
02:46:36,180 --> 02:46:37,300
Oh, okay.

3345
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:39,980
Is something coming after me?

3346
02:46:41,360 --> 02:46:42,380
I'm a little scared.

3347
02:46:43,400 --> 02:46:45,240
I keep getting caught on the tables.

3348
02:46:46,700 --> 02:46:47,640
Where do I go?

3349
02:46:48,820 --> 02:46:50,180
Do I go to Golden Freddy?

3350
02:46:54,030 --> 02:46:55,010
Jump scare incoming?

3351
02:47:00,310 --> 02:47:00,950
No...

3352
02:47:05,110 --> 02:47:05,870
What's this?

3353
02:47:16,570 --> 02:47:18,670
Left in the room south of there.

3354
02:47:19,250 --> 02:47:20,410
New door open.

3355
02:47:25,210 --> 02:47:26,370
Alright, Spongebob.

3356
02:47:27,470 --> 02:47:28,110
Six.

3357
02:47:39,120 --> 02:47:40,160
See you.

3358
02:47:41,460 --> 02:47:42,120
Oh shoot.

3359
02:47:49,850 --> 02:47:50,710
See you.

3360
02:47:51,230 --> 02:47:51,870
Later.

3361
02:47:57,560 --> 02:47:58,060
It's me.

3362
02:47:58,920 --> 02:47:59,320
Stop.

3363
02:48:00,620 --> 02:48:01,640
That'll be Golden Freddy.

3364
02:48:03,340 --> 02:48:04,060
Maybe we're okay.

3365
02:48:07,560 --> 02:48:08,680
See you later.

3366
02:48:10,080 --> 02:48:10,480
Fuck.

3367
02:48:12,960 --> 02:48:13,640
I hate this.

3368
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:14,120
I hate this.

3369
02:48:14,160 --> 02:48:14,500
I hate this.

3370
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:14,820
I hate this.

3371
02:48:25,340 --> 02:48:26,140
Got it.

3372
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:28,320
What if I did the cutscene?

3373
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:31,640
Anyway...

3374
02:48:34,100 --> 02:48:35,360
I can't see anything.

3375
02:48:35,620 --> 02:48:37,400
I actually can't see a single thing.

3376
02:48:38,620 --> 02:48:39,940
Am I able to move?

3377
02:48:42,820 --> 02:48:43,980
I don't know what's happening.

3378
02:48:47,180 --> 02:48:47,740
Oh.

3379
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:50,160
You saved me.

3380
02:48:51,160 --> 02:48:52,360
Run to the exit before.

3381
02:48:54,940 --> 02:48:55,400
Um...

3382
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,040
Wait, what's going on?

3383
02:49:04,540 --> 02:49:06,980
What's going on?

3384
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:08,140
Escape.

3385
02:49:08,860 --> 02:49:09,560
Oh my god.

3386
02:49:15,310 --> 02:49:15,930
Oh shoot.

3387
02:49:16,050 --> 02:49:16,390
Oh shoot.

3388
02:49:16,530 --> 02:49:16,650
Ah!

3389
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:42,080
Do I have it in my inventory?

3390
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:43,240
Wait.

3391
02:49:43,440 --> 02:49:44,480
Are we in the pre...

3392
02:49:44,480 --> 02:49:45,760
We're in the past.

3393
02:49:45,980 --> 02:49:47,080
I mean we're in the present.

3394
02:49:47,280 --> 02:49:48,040
Oh, man.

3395
02:49:48,240 --> 02:49:48,640
Oh my god.

3396
02:49:49,240 --> 02:49:51,320
Okay, I have to go do all of that over again.

3397
02:49:51,580 --> 02:49:52,380
Oh gosh.

3398
02:49:54,780 --> 02:49:55,540
Oh man!

3399
02:50:08,780 --> 02:50:10,020
I don't have it.

3400
02:50:10,120 --> 02:50:12,000
Yeah, because we have to go get it in the past.

3401
02:50:14,780 --> 02:50:16,640
The balloon game all over again too?

3402
02:50:16,940 --> 02:50:17,120
Ah!

3403
02:50:17,520 --> 02:50:18,140
You're right!

3404
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:22,040
Lame.

3405
02:50:22,300 --> 02:50:23,420
How did we get there before?

3406
02:50:23,640 --> 02:50:24,280
You know what, I'll just go.

3407
02:50:25,960 --> 02:50:27,720
Oh, that's Bonnie's hand.

3408
02:50:28,980 --> 02:50:30,640
That was Bonnie's hand for sure.

3409
02:50:31,640 --> 02:50:32,980
Let's just go through the party hallway.

3410
02:50:33,560 --> 02:50:37,160
Why did they have to turn off the lights then?

3411
02:50:39,680 --> 02:50:40,380
Never mind.

3412
02:50:41,820 --> 02:50:42,520
Never mind.

3413
02:50:47,580 --> 02:50:48,740
I hear someone else.

3414
02:51:05,130 --> 02:51:07,410
Oh gosh, this is going to be pretty risky.

3415
02:51:07,690 --> 02:51:08,430
I'm not going to lie.

3416
02:51:11,870 --> 02:51:12,790
I think he's...

3417
02:51:14,170 --> 02:51:14,970
I think we're okay.

3418
02:51:14,990 --> 02:51:15,370
Oh shoot.

3419
02:51:15,450 --> 02:51:15,950
No, we're not okay.

3420
02:51:17,090 --> 02:51:17,810
We're not okay.

3421
02:51:20,410 --> 02:51:21,870
I maybe could have run for it.

3422
02:51:22,750 --> 02:51:24,210
I maybe could have run for it.

3423
02:51:24,350 --> 02:51:25,990
No, no, no, please don't go to the arcade.

3424
02:51:26,150 --> 02:51:26,350
No!

3425
02:51:28,330 --> 02:51:29,350
No, Springtrap, please!

3426
02:51:30,330 --> 02:51:30,990
Turn around!

3427
02:51:31,270 --> 02:51:32,250
No, no, no!

3428
02:51:35,190 --> 02:51:37,790
Auto-saves on nights four to five suck, so be careful.

3429
02:51:37,970 --> 02:51:38,130
Okay.

3430
02:51:38,550 --> 02:51:39,490
I couldn't see.

3431
02:51:39,570 --> 02:51:41,030
I had the flashlight on, but I ran...

3432
02:51:41,030 --> 02:51:42,290
I was taking you, asshole!

3433
02:51:42,650 --> 02:51:44,030
But I ran past it.

3434
02:51:44,110 --> 02:51:44,690
It's my fault.

3435
02:51:56,170 --> 02:51:56,850
Oh my god!

3436
02:51:56,930 --> 02:51:57,790
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

3437
02:51:58,690 --> 02:51:59,630
Actually, this might be good.

3438
02:52:00,250 --> 02:52:01,290
Because we'll call him out.

3439
02:52:03,010 --> 02:52:03,650
Here he comes.

3440
02:52:04,090 --> 02:52:05,550
Maybe he'll go to the right instead.

3441
02:52:06,990 --> 02:52:08,950
Maybe he'll leave the arcade.

3442
02:52:13,060 --> 02:52:14,740
Maybe he'll leave the arcade.

3443
02:52:14,900 --> 02:52:15,220
Okay.

3444
02:52:16,620 --> 02:52:17,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3445
02:52:17,540 --> 02:52:18,000
Go that way.

3446
02:52:18,040 --> 02:52:18,420
Go that way.

3447
02:52:18,440 --> 02:52:18,840
Go that way.

3448
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:19,780
And go down.

3449
02:52:19,980 --> 02:52:20,980
That would be even better.

3450
02:52:21,800 --> 02:52:22,440
Go down.

3451
02:52:27,910 --> 02:52:28,230
Nice!

3452
02:52:28,350 --> 02:52:29,990
Okay, now we have to hope that Chica...

3453
02:52:30,530 --> 02:52:32,030
is not in the arcade either.

3454
02:52:35,050 --> 02:52:35,690
Fuck you!

3455
02:52:56,860 --> 02:52:58,260
And what if I move?

3456
02:53:01,460 --> 02:53:01,920
Oh.

3457
02:53:01,920 --> 02:53:02,760
Is he in here?

3458
02:53:05,140 --> 02:53:06,080
I heard something.

3459
02:53:08,420 --> 02:53:09,280
I think we're okay.

3460
02:53:15,830 --> 02:53:17,170
Don't turn off the lights, please.

3461
02:53:19,110 --> 02:53:19,570
Okay.

3462
02:53:22,990 --> 02:53:25,370
So before it was just unlucky timing, I think.

3463
02:53:25,930 --> 02:53:26,390
Dude!

3464
02:53:27,910 --> 02:53:28,390
Oh.

3465
02:53:28,630 --> 02:53:29,390
Got it.

3466
02:53:29,530 --> 02:53:30,730
Oh, so that's what happened.

3467
02:53:35,490 --> 02:53:36,670
Are you okay, girl?

3468
02:53:45,510 --> 02:53:46,630
Are you okay?

3469
02:53:48,110 --> 02:53:49,410
So that's what took so long.

3470
02:53:49,610 --> 02:53:50,590
You saved me.

3471
02:53:50,910 --> 02:53:52,290
Run to the exit before...

3472
02:53:52,950 --> 02:53:53,190
Okay.

3473
02:53:54,250 --> 02:53:56,090
Wow, she did not even...

3474
02:53:56,090 --> 02:53:56,990
Okay.

3475
02:53:59,970 --> 02:54:00,710
Oh my god.

3476
02:54:01,090 --> 02:54:01,570
Here.

3477
02:54:02,510 --> 02:54:02,990
Yeah!

3478
02:54:04,150 --> 02:54:04,630
Okay.

3479
02:54:07,750 --> 02:54:08,810
But now I can see.

3480
02:54:09,150 --> 02:54:09,990
So it's okay.

3481
02:54:16,040 --> 02:54:17,440
I can't believe she didn't even...

3482
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:18,620
She didn't even thank me.

3483
02:54:18,680 --> 02:54:20,680
She just said, you saved me and left.

3484
02:54:21,240 --> 02:54:23,040
It just keeps getting worse and worse.

3485
02:54:23,400 --> 02:54:26,980
This ends tomorrow on the fifth night.

3486
02:54:27,760 --> 02:54:31,280
This ends tomorrow on the fifth night.

3487
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:34,740
Animatronic characters get a bit quirky at night.

3488
02:54:35,400 --> 02:54:36,900
Oh, this is not my house.

3489
02:54:36,920 --> 02:54:37,480
This is school.

3490
02:54:47,280 --> 02:54:47,720
No!

3491
02:54:48,100 --> 02:54:49,160
Oh, this is my house.

3492
02:54:49,400 --> 02:54:49,740
No.

3493
02:54:50,700 --> 02:54:50,900
Oh, this is my house.

3494
02:54:52,740 --> 02:54:53,180
Oh.

3495
02:54:53,180 --> 02:54:54,100
Go to the ball pit.

3496
02:54:54,320 --> 02:54:55,200
Did I sleep all day?

3497
02:54:55,380 --> 02:54:56,440
I'm running out of time.

3498
02:54:57,160 --> 02:54:58,000
No more school.

3499
02:54:58,180 --> 02:54:58,820
No more distractions.

3500
02:54:59,080 --> 02:55:00,020
I'm bringing dad home.

3501
02:55:01,780 --> 02:55:02,220
Interesting.

3502
02:55:04,280 --> 02:55:05,380
So it's daytime.

3503
02:55:05,660 --> 02:55:07,300
Is he wandering around?

3504
02:55:07,560 --> 02:55:08,140
You think?

3505
02:55:08,640 --> 02:55:10,000
There's no way I can sleep now.

3506
02:55:10,200 --> 02:55:10,980
Where is my cat?

3507
02:55:11,500 --> 02:55:12,460
Where is my cat?

3508
02:55:12,640 --> 02:55:12,780
Where is my cat?

3509
02:55:15,880 --> 02:55:19,800
I also can't tell if it's too stressed out to sketch something right now.

3510
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,220
I can't tell if he's wandering or not.

3511
02:55:26,940 --> 02:55:28,020
What about breakfast?

3512
02:55:34,380 --> 02:55:35,260
Guess we'll leave.

3513
02:55:37,560 --> 02:55:38,320
What was that?

3514
02:55:39,640 --> 02:55:40,840
Did the door glitch?

3515
02:55:47,270 --> 02:55:50,010
We're also missing one more item of my dad's.

3516
02:55:54,850 --> 02:55:57,610
The laughing kids, other than the pizza's phone number.

3517
02:55:57,910 --> 02:56:00,930
Why are there kids laughing in my basement?

3518
02:56:01,650 --> 02:56:02,710
And where's my cat?

3519
02:56:06,630 --> 02:56:07,970
Was there something under the table?

3520
02:56:08,050 --> 02:56:08,970
No, it just...

3521
02:56:09,910 --> 02:56:10,790
It's breezy.

3522
02:56:11,230 --> 02:56:13,010
So it does that for some reason.

3523
02:56:13,090 --> 02:56:14,070
I'm not quite sure why.

3524
02:56:15,930 --> 02:56:16,910
You can see it.

3525
02:56:16,910 --> 02:56:17,950
It's kind of rustling.

3526
02:56:22,490 --> 02:56:23,230
Oh my god.

3527
02:56:23,630 --> 02:56:24,070
I can hear him.

3528
02:56:24,190 --> 02:56:24,990
Let's just leave.

3529
02:56:29,510 --> 02:56:31,150
What is this static-y sound?

3530
02:56:33,030 --> 02:56:33,470
Scary.

3531
02:56:34,270 --> 02:56:35,190
Where's my cat?

3532
02:56:36,330 --> 02:56:37,450
Where is my cat?

3533
02:56:37,530 --> 02:56:38,230
Where is my cat?

3534
02:56:38,830 --> 02:56:40,050
Where is my cat?

3535
02:56:41,990 --> 02:56:42,870
Oh no!

3536
02:56:49,940 --> 02:56:53,280
It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?

3537
02:56:53,340 --> 02:56:53,900
Oh my god.

3538
02:56:57,580 --> 02:57:00,880
When I go in there, I'm not sure if I'll come back out.

3539
02:57:01,100 --> 02:57:02,340
Don't say that, Ozzy!

3540
02:57:03,460 --> 02:57:05,320
But I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

3541
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:11,620
Hold on.

3542
02:57:11,740 --> 02:57:13,700
My throat is really starting to kill me.

3543
02:57:14,280 --> 02:57:15,080
It's me!

3544
02:57:22,800 --> 02:57:24,460
I forgot the minigame!

3545
02:57:24,600 --> 02:57:25,060
Oh shoot.

3546
02:57:26,140 --> 02:57:28,580
I was so concerned about Chica, I forgot the minigame.

3547
02:57:29,120 --> 02:57:30,140
You think it's okay?

3548
02:57:33,680 --> 02:57:36,300
Does it unlock like a secret ending or something?

3549
02:57:43,140 --> 02:57:43,620
Oh.

3550
02:57:43,640 --> 02:57:44,000
Hello.

3551
02:57:44,340 --> 02:57:45,300
What are you doing?

3552
02:57:45,780 --> 02:57:46,780
You're chowing down.

3553
02:57:47,120 --> 02:57:48,340
You're chomping.

3554
02:57:48,760 --> 02:57:50,740
The cat is in another pizzeria.

3555
02:57:54,670 --> 02:57:55,670
Trade with Jet.

3556
02:57:55,750 --> 02:57:56,410
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3557
02:57:56,450 --> 02:57:56,890
Let's do that.

3558
02:57:57,030 --> 02:57:58,190
Thank you for reminding me.

3559
02:58:02,320 --> 02:58:04,240
How many endings are in this game anyway?

3560
02:58:08,610 --> 02:58:09,510
What the?

3561
02:58:09,590 --> 02:58:10,410
Oh sh...

3562
02:58:10,410 --> 02:58:11,250
Okay.

3563
02:58:11,490 --> 02:58:12,650
Well, never mind, guys.

3564
02:58:15,130 --> 02:58:16,070
Never mind.

3565
02:58:23,700 --> 02:58:25,520
Where is Jeff anyway?

3566
02:58:26,160 --> 02:58:26,700
Jeff?

3567
02:58:30,660 --> 02:58:31,200
Jeff?

3568
02:58:32,060 --> 02:58:32,600
Jeff?

3569
02:58:35,020 --> 02:58:36,540
Three bad, two good.

3570
02:58:37,080 --> 02:58:40,600
I'm guessing I have to collect all my dad's stuff to get one of the good endings.

3571
02:58:40,600 --> 02:58:40,800
Thanks.

3572
02:58:45,020 --> 02:58:47,420
That doesn't spark confidence.

3573
02:58:49,240 --> 02:58:49,760
What?

3574
02:58:49,820 --> 02:58:50,420
Why is it locked?

3575
02:58:50,840 --> 02:58:53,460
Of all times for Jeff to actually lock this door.

3576
02:58:53,740 --> 02:58:55,060
I better hurry up and find him.

3577
02:58:57,300 --> 02:58:57,820
No.

3578
02:58:57,940 --> 02:58:58,640
No more running.

3579
02:58:58,920 --> 02:58:59,440
What?

3580
02:58:59,500 --> 02:59:00,380
This is not running.

3581
02:59:00,760 --> 02:59:01,700
This is backstage.

3582
02:59:04,540 --> 02:59:05,060
No,

3583
02:59:10,860 --> 02:59:11,480
no, no.

3584
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:12,520
Was he in here?

3585
02:59:13,380 --> 02:59:13,900
Jeff!

3586
02:59:14,740 --> 02:59:15,140
Jeff!

3587
02:59:18,980 --> 02:59:20,860
I'll have to explore a little bit more.

3588
02:59:20,920 --> 02:59:22,040
I hope you guys don't mind then.

3589
02:59:22,720 --> 02:59:23,480
Is he in here?

3590
02:59:24,680 --> 02:59:26,000
Oh yeah, we haven't seen...

3591
02:59:26,480 --> 02:59:26,880
Jeff!

3592
02:59:28,980 --> 02:59:31,600
Okay, he could be doing way worse things in this office.

3593
02:59:31,640 --> 02:59:32,280
I'll be honest.

3594
02:59:32,700 --> 02:59:33,880
What you doing there, Jeff?

3595
02:59:35,020 --> 02:59:35,980
What's it look like, kid?

3596
02:59:36,220 --> 02:59:36,620
Working.

3597
02:59:37,200 --> 02:59:38,800
He's playing extreme solitaire.

3598
02:59:39,240 --> 02:59:40,900
What are you doing barging into my office?

3599
02:59:43,900 --> 02:59:44,820
I need to get into the ball...

3600
02:59:44,820 --> 02:59:47,400
I mean, I left my jacket in the room of the ball pit the other day.

3601
02:59:47,480 --> 02:59:48,260
Can you let me in there?

3602
02:59:50,140 --> 02:59:51,780
Can't wait to see you on an aircraft carrier.

3603
02:59:52,720 --> 02:59:53,080
Yeah!

3604
02:59:54,060 --> 02:59:55,260
Ha, nice try, kid.

3605
02:59:55,480 --> 02:59:58,440
You're wearing the exact same jacket you wore when you went in.

3606
02:59:59,080 --> 02:59:59,760
No, I'm not.

3607
02:59:59,820 --> 03:00:01,860
This is my backup jacket.

3608
03:00:02,740 --> 03:00:03,700
Nice save, Ozzy.

3609
03:00:05,820 --> 03:00:07,660
The other one has my wallet.

3610
03:00:07,960 --> 03:00:09,480
I kinda need it to buy pizza.

3611
03:00:10,280 --> 03:00:11,520
Oh yeah, that's pretty important.

3612
03:00:12,020 --> 03:00:12,960
Here, take the key.

3613
03:00:12,960 --> 03:00:14,880
But don't go playing around in that ball pit again.

3614
03:00:15,360 --> 03:00:17,760
I promise I'll stay out of there as soon as I'm done.

3615
03:00:17,980 --> 03:00:19,600
Never want to see that thing again anyway.

3616
03:00:20,400 --> 03:00:21,420
That's gross, huh?

3617
03:00:22,160 --> 03:00:23,520
You have no idea.

3618
03:00:27,280 --> 03:00:28,360
What else is in here?

3619
03:00:31,120 --> 03:00:32,380
Stay out of the gross pit.

3620
03:00:32,560 --> 03:00:34,580
I get pink-eyed just from looking at it.

3621
03:00:35,700 --> 03:00:36,100
Okay.

3622
03:00:38,240 --> 03:00:41,040
Look, it has even some of the little stars up top.

3623
03:00:45,330 --> 03:00:45,730
I...

3624
03:00:45,730 --> 03:00:49,070
For some reason, read that as Fredbear's frickin' show.

3625
03:00:52,250 --> 03:00:53,730
I was like...

3626
03:00:58,710 --> 03:00:59,670
Oh my god.

3627
03:01:00,070 --> 03:01:00,550
What the?

3628
03:01:02,030 --> 03:01:02,510
What the?

3629
03:01:02,630 --> 03:01:04,730
Is it... am I... I can't tell if I'm actually...

3630
03:01:07,430 --> 03:01:07,970
What the?

3631
03:01:08,790 --> 03:01:10,290
Oh my god, he's actually chasing me!

3632
03:01:10,610 --> 03:01:12,370
Oh my god.

3633
03:01:12,470 --> 03:01:14,270
Oh my god, oh my god, he's actually chasing me!

3634
03:01:14,730 --> 03:01:16,310
It was... I was taking too long!

3635
03:01:16,390 --> 03:01:17,250
I'm sorry, game, I'm sorry!

3636
03:01:17,530 --> 03:01:18,070
Oh my god, please.

3637
03:01:18,250 --> 03:01:18,710
Oh, but...

3638
03:01:19,270 --> 03:01:19,610
What the?

3639
03:01:24,180 --> 03:01:26,540
You guys, the prompt was not showing up.

3640
03:01:27,120 --> 03:01:29,060
Why was the prompt not showing up?

3641
03:01:30,520 --> 03:01:32,460
The prompt was not showing up!

3642
03:01:32,500 --> 03:01:33,500
You saw that, right?

3643
03:01:37,820 --> 03:01:38,920
Oh my god.

3644
03:01:39,120 --> 03:01:40,880
No way, I have to go through all of this again.

3645
03:01:41,100 --> 03:01:41,940
This is so stupid.

3646
03:01:43,360 --> 03:01:44,700
Maybe that's why he's not here.

3647
03:01:45,060 --> 03:01:47,040
Because he's at the pizzeria.

3648
03:01:47,680 --> 03:01:48,380
My papa.

3649
03:01:49,280 --> 03:01:49,980
Dad's underwear.

3650
03:01:53,020 --> 03:01:54,500
Oh, I can get the fireworks now!

3651
03:01:54,560 --> 03:01:56,200
Okay, blessing in disguise, right?

3652
03:01:56,340 --> 03:01:58,060
And also, let's search for the cat a little bit.

3653
03:02:02,400 --> 03:02:03,680
I don't see our cat.

3654
03:02:06,600 --> 03:02:08,000
I don't see the cat.

3655
03:02:08,300 --> 03:02:08,920
Oh gosh.

3656
03:02:10,040 --> 03:02:12,620
The Game Over music gives Metroid Prime vibes.

3657
03:02:13,680 --> 03:02:14,620
Where's our cat?

3658
03:02:15,960 --> 03:02:17,240
In the attic, maybe?

3659
03:02:23,900 --> 03:02:26,080
Why are all the lights flickering?

3660
03:02:30,960 --> 03:02:31,560
Cat!

3661
03:02:36,520 --> 03:02:38,520
I'm really worried about him.

3662
03:02:41,870 --> 03:02:43,490
The cat is under the table.

3663
03:02:43,670 --> 03:02:43,810
No.

3664
03:02:43,970 --> 03:02:45,110
No, he's not.

3665
03:02:46,190 --> 03:02:48,030
The table does this regardless.

3666
03:02:49,010 --> 03:02:51,930
The table does that even when there's nothing under there.

3667
03:02:56,450 --> 03:02:57,990
Is there a reason to find the cat?

3668
03:02:58,090 --> 03:02:59,950
Or is it just for good cat vibes?

3669
03:03:00,090 --> 03:03:01,130
For good cat vibes.

3670
03:03:04,710 --> 03:03:06,950
Okay, let's go to the library first.

3671
03:03:24,140 --> 03:03:25,680
Oh, he's not even here!

3672
03:03:28,480 --> 03:03:35,560
Maybe they gave you... maybe if you don't go into the attic, they gave the handheld as an extra tradable, you know?

3673
03:03:35,660 --> 03:03:36,500
Just in case.

3674
03:03:38,080 --> 03:03:38,520
Probably.

3675
03:03:42,320 --> 03:03:43,040
School, maybe.

3676
03:03:45,880 --> 03:03:50,080
Because the attic one, you don't really have a reason to go into the attic once it's boarded up.

3677
03:03:51,200 --> 03:03:54,300
So there wouldn't be a reason to find the Freddy mask, you know?

3678
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:55,680
I think.

3679
03:03:56,800 --> 03:03:57,240
Closed?

3680
03:03:58,060 --> 03:04:00,220
Not sure I want to be showing my face around here.

3681
03:04:00,320 --> 03:04:03,240
Wait, why is the school closed?

3682
03:04:03,720 --> 03:04:04,580
Is it Saturday?

3683
03:04:04,860 --> 03:04:05,300
Home?

3684
03:04:06,880 --> 03:04:07,320
Oh, OK.

3685
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:07,860
Anyway.

3686
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,600
Let's go to... I'll check out the mill just in case.

3687
03:04:13,660 --> 03:04:14,300
As well.

3688
03:04:17,120 --> 03:04:18,680
The Freddy's mask is luck-based.

3689
03:04:18,900 --> 03:04:19,240
Oh, really!

3690
03:04:20,680 --> 03:04:21,360
Lucky us!

3691
03:04:25,560 --> 03:04:26,500
Okay, nothing else here.

3692
03:04:26,620 --> 03:04:26,840
Cool.

3693
03:04:26,940 --> 03:04:27,940
Let's go look for pizza.

3694
03:04:32,300 --> 03:04:33,400
Ugh, my nose!

3695
03:04:34,300 --> 03:04:35,820
Oh, I have some medicine here.

3696
03:04:35,940 --> 03:04:36,520
I'm gonna take some.

3697
03:04:37,480 --> 03:04:39,440
I don't think it'll stop my throat from hurting,

3698
03:04:49,920 --> 03:04:50,800
Let's go.

3699
03:04:51,940 --> 03:04:53,700
You got caught in the corner of the ladder.

3700
03:04:53,780 --> 03:04:54,580
That's why it didn't show up.

3701
03:05:02,820 --> 03:05:04,080
I'll take some cough drops.

3702
03:05:04,240 --> 03:05:06,080
Or I'll get another cough drop after this.

3703
03:05:08,460 --> 03:05:09,400
I don't know.

3704
03:05:09,480 --> 03:05:10,580
Hopefully it's just allergies.

3705
03:05:13,360 --> 03:05:14,340
Honey lemon tea.

3706
03:05:14,560 --> 03:05:16,280
Yeah, I'm gonna take it easy today, mostly.

3707
03:05:20,240 --> 03:05:21,020
So that I...

3708
03:05:24,020 --> 03:05:25,520
don't push it too much.

3709
03:05:26,720 --> 03:05:28,800
Especially before the concert, you know?

3710
03:05:28,860 --> 03:05:29,420
Oh my god.

3711
03:05:37,990 --> 03:05:38,470
Hello!

3712
03:05:40,010 --> 03:05:41,190
What you doing there, Jeff?

3713
03:05:41,350 --> 03:05:41,830
I'm working.

3714
03:05:42,610 --> 03:05:43,650
What are you talking about?

3715
03:05:43,930 --> 03:05:48,730
Oh, had to start locking doors because some hooligans keep sneaking in and leaving those balls all over the place.

3716
03:05:49,270 --> 03:05:51,730
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?

3717
03:05:52,090 --> 03:05:52,570
No!

3718
03:05:52,910 --> 03:05:53,970
I mean, no.

3719
03:05:54,070 --> 03:05:54,730
I have no idea.

3720
03:05:55,090 --> 03:05:55,830
I mean...

3721
03:05:55,830 --> 03:05:57,690
I do not need to get into the ball.

3722
03:05:57,990 --> 03:05:59,930
I mean, I left my jacket in the room with the ball...

3723
03:05:59,930 --> 03:06:02,030
in the ball pit the other day.

3724
03:06:02,090 --> 03:06:02,650
Can you let me in there?

3725
03:06:04,070 --> 03:06:04,430
Okay.

3726
03:06:04,970 --> 03:06:07,470
Sorry, I didn't realize it would be a different thing.

3727
03:06:09,390 --> 03:06:10,330
A different dialogue.

3728
03:06:10,970 --> 03:06:11,710
Okay, here we go.

3729
03:06:15,370 --> 03:06:16,850
I know nothing about ball pits.

3730
03:06:17,370 --> 03:06:18,050
Oh my god.

3731
03:06:18,150 --> 03:06:18,750
Oh my god!

3732
03:06:18,790 --> 03:06:20,210
That scared me so bad!

3733
03:06:22,090 --> 03:06:22,450
Run!

3734
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:33,780
There we go.

3735
03:06:33,780 --> 03:06:37,360
Wait, is he gonna start keep chasing after me even as I come in here?

3736
03:06:39,180 --> 03:06:40,120
Oh my god, he is!

3737
03:06:40,240 --> 03:06:41,220
Oh my god, he is!

3738
03:06:41,480 --> 03:06:41,840
God!

3739
03:06:43,760 --> 03:06:44,340
Fine dad!

3740
03:06:50,720 --> 03:06:52,420
He must be in the party room, right?

3741
03:06:57,400 --> 03:06:58,800
Oh my god, he's fast!

3742
03:06:58,800 --> 03:06:59,260
Fast!

3743
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:23,260
This is so annoying.

3744
03:07:25,060 --> 03:07:26,280
The auto-save.

3745
03:07:26,340 --> 03:07:28,440
Okay, I understand what you meant by the auto-save now.

3746
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:33,200
But was it locked?

3747
03:07:33,340 --> 03:07:34,920
I didn't see if there was a prompt or not.

3748
03:07:35,220 --> 03:07:37,240
I don't think you can save in this game, right?

3749
03:07:37,320 --> 03:07:38,400
It's only auto-saves.

3750
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:55,660
Use the ticket machine to save.

3751
03:07:55,880 --> 03:07:56,320
Oh, okay.

3752
03:07:58,520 --> 03:08:02,780
I was gonna say once I get the key, but he starts chasing after me, so we'll just do it here.

3753
03:08:02,980 --> 03:08:03,260
Okay.

3754
03:08:04,200 --> 03:08:05,020
I don't understand.

3755
03:08:13,150 --> 03:08:14,830
Oh wait, you meant this ticket machine.

3756
03:08:15,850 --> 03:08:16,950
Not the voucher machine.

3757
03:08:20,430 --> 03:08:20,870
Oh.

3758
03:08:22,090 --> 03:08:23,310
You guys, it won't let me.

3759
03:08:25,230 --> 03:08:25,890
You guys?

3760
03:08:28,390 --> 03:08:29,130
It won't let me.

3761
03:08:33,990 --> 03:08:34,710
Play some games?

3762
03:08:34,790 --> 03:08:36,290
I think I have tickets though, don't I?

3763
03:08:37,310 --> 03:08:38,370
Unless I used all of them.

3764
03:08:38,670 --> 03:08:39,390
Do you have any tickets?

3765
03:08:39,790 --> 03:08:41,370
I thought I did.

3766
03:08:41,810 --> 03:08:42,230
Let's see.

3767
03:08:44,910 --> 03:08:46,250
I just need to play this one twice.

3768
03:09:00,500 --> 03:09:02,300
Oh god, I was so close!

3769
03:09:03,520 --> 03:09:05,320
I was so close!

3770
03:09:08,420 --> 03:09:11,280
So Kinki, I just saw that you said you finished your icing.

3771
03:09:14,240 --> 03:09:14,760
Nice.

3772
03:09:15,780 --> 03:09:17,700
You're making a cake for your grandma?

3773
03:09:18,460 --> 03:09:19,540
How are you real?

3774
03:09:26,380 --> 03:09:26,900
Yippee!

3775
03:09:37,840 --> 03:09:39,700
My postcards came today, they're so cute.

3776
03:09:40,020 --> 03:09:40,800
Thank you!

3777
03:09:41,140 --> 03:09:41,940
Oh, okay, nice.

3778
03:09:42,100 --> 03:09:42,420
Okay.

3779
03:09:43,780 --> 03:09:44,780
Okay, it's saved!

3780
03:09:44,780 --> 03:09:46,260
Everybody, we're safe, we're safe.

3781
03:09:49,700 --> 03:09:50,320
We're good.

3782
03:09:52,540 --> 03:09:53,200
We're good.

3783
03:09:57,700 --> 03:10:01,080
So I thought it was similarly to like the...

3784
03:10:02,580 --> 03:10:03,800
You know where...

3785
03:10:06,620 --> 03:10:09,680
Where it says like escape, you just run to the ball pit?

3786
03:10:09,860 --> 03:10:11,980
I thought it was gonna be the same where it's just like, find dad.

3787
03:10:11,980 --> 03:10:14,140
You just run to where dad is, you know what I mean?

3788
03:10:14,780 --> 03:10:15,680
What you doing there, Jeff?

3789
03:10:15,780 --> 03:10:16,520
What's it look like, kid?

3790
03:10:16,700 --> 03:10:17,020
Working.

3791
03:10:17,380 --> 03:10:19,840
If you barged in here to ask about the room with the ball pit...

3792
03:10:19,840 --> 03:10:21,600
No, I'm not opening the door.

3793
03:10:21,980 --> 03:10:22,300
Huh?

3794
03:10:22,480 --> 03:10:23,260
What are you talking about?

3795
03:10:23,940 --> 03:10:25,580
I'm just gonna lock the door, the hooligans.

3796
03:10:25,700 --> 03:10:26,440
Yeah, the hooligans.

3797
03:10:26,500 --> 03:10:26,740
Okay.

3798
03:10:28,540 --> 03:10:29,500
Alright, we get the key.

3799
03:10:31,800 --> 03:10:33,220
Yeah, I'll try hiding this time.

3800
03:10:33,380 --> 03:10:35,700
Maybe... I wonder if I can like... make it...

3801
03:10:35,700 --> 03:10:36,460
Okay, here we go.

3802
03:10:36,880 --> 03:10:37,340
Just run.

3803
03:10:38,560 --> 03:10:38,880
Gosh!

3804
03:10:39,360 --> 03:10:39,760
Oh!

3805
03:10:39,920 --> 03:10:42,360
I got a bit of a... sprint there.

3806
03:10:42,520 --> 03:10:42,840
Oh my god.

3807
03:10:42,940 --> 03:10:44,080
Run, run, Oswald.

3808
03:10:44,280 --> 03:10:45,340
Run, run, Oswald.

3809
03:10:45,440 --> 03:10:45,660
Run.

3810
03:10:46,260 --> 03:10:47,560
Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy.

3811
03:10:50,220 --> 03:10:51,500
Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy.

3812
03:10:53,480 --> 03:10:54,640
Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy.

3813
03:10:57,020 --> 03:10:58,620
Okay, okay.

3814
03:10:58,880 --> 03:10:59,720
And keep going!

3815
03:11:00,260 --> 03:11:01,000
Keep going!

3816
03:11:01,240 --> 03:11:02,480
Oh my god, it's so scary!

3817
03:11:07,500 --> 03:11:09,420
I'm gonna try and do the same thing I did before.

3818
03:11:09,420 --> 03:11:13,440
If Chica's here, I'll just run past her and then I'll hide instead of trying to open the door.

3819
03:11:17,290 --> 03:11:18,210
Oh my god!

3820
03:11:18,270 --> 03:11:18,970
No, no, no!

3821
03:11:28,600 --> 03:11:29,040
Nooooooo!

3822
03:11:33,370 --> 03:11:34,050
It's done.

3823
03:11:35,750 --> 03:11:36,610
Holy cow!

3824
03:11:36,770 --> 03:11:38,210
Okay, I'm just gonna hide then.

3825
03:11:38,310 --> 03:11:38,970
I'm just gonna hide.

3826
03:11:39,710 --> 03:11:41,770
The guy is so fast!

3827
03:11:43,110 --> 03:11:43,990
That QTE!

3828
03:11:44,370 --> 03:11:44,810
I...

3829
03:11:48,330 --> 03:11:49,650
This is Night 5, everybody.

3830
03:11:50,450 --> 03:11:52,190
This is true Night 5 gaming.

3831
03:11:59,890 --> 03:12:01,290
Happens if you run back to Jeff.

3832
03:12:01,730 --> 03:12:02,430
Should we see?

3833
03:12:02,550 --> 03:12:03,670
I wonder if the door is locked.

3834
03:12:06,470 --> 03:12:07,510
Might be kind of fun, though.

3835
03:12:15,260 --> 03:12:16,300
Why are you here?

3836
03:12:21,010 --> 03:12:21,990
The vent is safer?

3837
03:12:22,250 --> 03:12:22,750
Oh, okay.

3838
03:12:24,610 --> 03:12:27,150
Um... which vent would be good to go to?

3839
03:12:41,020 --> 03:12:43,100
Maybe the one where Freddy Fazbear is.

3840
03:12:43,660 --> 03:12:44,360
This one?

3841
03:12:52,460 --> 03:12:53,420
Swat the spiders!

3842
03:12:53,640 --> 03:12:53,920
D!

3843
03:12:55,440 --> 03:12:56,000
A!

3844
03:12:56,960 --> 03:12:57,520
F!

3845
03:12:58,060 --> 03:12:58,620
S!

3846
03:13:03,150 --> 03:13:04,670
Oh my god!

3847
03:13:04,890 --> 03:13:06,950
That was so close!

3848
03:13:09,430 --> 03:13:11,250
Holy moly, that was close!

3849
03:13:13,690 --> 03:13:14,850
The phone is ringing.

3850
03:13:15,650 --> 03:13:16,950
I think it's security.

3851
03:13:19,850 --> 03:13:21,510
But of course he's gonna go in there.

3852
03:13:43,740 --> 03:13:44,660
Dad item?

3853
03:13:44,980 --> 03:13:45,500
Wait, where?

3854
03:13:48,540 --> 03:13:49,340
I don't see it.

3855
03:14:04,060 --> 03:14:04,660
Please.

3856
03:14:06,280 --> 03:14:07,100
Bottom right?

3857
03:14:07,480 --> 03:14:08,080
Hello?

3858
03:14:08,280 --> 03:14:08,780
Hello?

3859
03:14:09,160 --> 03:14:09,760
Hello?

3860
03:14:10,060 --> 03:14:10,300
Hello?

3861
03:14:10,520 --> 03:14:13,220
I'm not sure if it's the same person working here.

3862
03:14:13,500 --> 03:14:17,920
Honestly, five days is a long time for someone in this position.

3863
03:14:18,160 --> 03:14:20,800
So I'm sure you are doing great.

3864
03:14:21,480 --> 03:14:29,780
But as a tradition, if you have decided to move on to other things, just make sure that you pass on the important notes to the next person.

3865
03:14:29,780 --> 03:14:32,760
To help them settle in, like what I did to you.

3866
03:14:32,760 --> 03:14:33,160
Middle right?

3867
03:14:33,280 --> 03:14:33,740
Oh!

3868
03:14:33,780 --> 03:14:34,840
Are you kidding me?

3869
03:14:45,120 --> 03:14:46,300
Come on, Chica!

3870
03:14:47,040 --> 03:14:47,760
Middle right.

3871
03:14:53,140 --> 03:14:54,460
I don't see anything.

3872
03:14:56,680 --> 03:14:59,240
We'll wait for Chica to leave the other room as well?

3873
03:15:00,400 --> 03:15:01,380
Oh my gosh.

3874
03:15:02,400 --> 03:15:03,280
Oh my gosh.

3875
03:15:07,200 --> 03:15:07,840
Okay, please leave.

3876
03:15:08,340 --> 03:15:09,040
Thank you.

3877
03:15:09,620 --> 03:15:11,060
See the blue in the bottom right?

3878
03:15:11,600 --> 03:15:12,320
Kind of.

3879
03:15:12,400 --> 03:15:12,960
I think so.

3880
03:15:14,980 --> 03:15:16,580
That is so hard to see.

3881
03:15:21,680 --> 03:15:22,500
Come on!

3882
03:15:32,550 --> 03:15:33,070
Chica.

3883
03:15:33,270 --> 03:15:33,790
Chica.

3884
03:15:35,310 --> 03:15:35,830
Chica.

3885
03:15:36,330 --> 03:15:36,850
Chica.

3886
03:15:40,910 --> 03:15:42,010
She's being quirky.

3887
03:15:50,660 --> 03:15:51,880
Dad's name tag from work!

3888
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:53,800
Oh my gosh.

3889
03:15:53,920 --> 03:15:54,480
Get in there.

3890
03:15:55,240 --> 03:15:56,700
Find all the clues about dad!

3891
03:15:57,700 --> 03:15:59,000
Okay, let's see what it is.

3892
03:16:00,560 --> 03:16:01,460
Dad's name tag.

3893
03:16:02,380 --> 03:16:03,600
Dad's name tag from work.

3894
03:16:03,840 --> 03:16:05,920
He was so upset to lose his job at the mill.

3895
03:16:06,400 --> 03:16:06,840
Hello.

3896
03:16:06,940 --> 03:16:08,020
My name is dad.

3897
03:16:10,320 --> 03:16:11,460
It wasn't his fault.

3898
03:16:12,040 --> 03:16:15,460
But that didn't stop him from telling mom how ashamed he felt.

3899
03:16:16,460 --> 03:16:16,900
Awww.

3900
03:16:18,820 --> 03:16:23,140
Dad looked so sad when he told me I lost his job at the mill.

3901
03:16:23,340 --> 03:16:25,440
I didn't understand why he kept saying I'm sorry.

3902
03:16:26,460 --> 03:16:28,100
I never thought it was his fault.

3903
03:16:28,220 --> 03:16:29,720
Dad always worked so hard.

3904
03:16:32,320 --> 03:16:33,840
Did you redo the balloon game?

3905
03:16:33,940 --> 03:16:35,560
It feels important because it has the restaurant layout.

3906
03:16:36,620 --> 03:16:37,760
No, I haven't.

3907
03:16:38,420 --> 03:16:39,080
Not yet.

3908
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:40,660
Probably should do that.

3909
03:16:43,800 --> 03:16:45,320
I'm glad he's my dad.

3910
03:16:47,480 --> 03:16:47,900
God.

3911
03:16:48,700 --> 03:16:49,540
This game.

3912
03:16:53,860 --> 03:16:55,000
Oh my gosh.

3913
03:16:55,440 --> 03:16:55,860
Okay.

3914
03:17:01,710 --> 03:17:05,930
So we probably will get to that door and it's going to be like, I need a...

3915
03:17:06,850 --> 03:17:07,690
Also, question.

3916
03:17:07,990 --> 03:17:10,530
Did anybody see when I grabbed that if it saved?

3917
03:17:13,230 --> 03:17:15,070
When I grabbed this name tag, did it save?

3918
03:17:16,230 --> 03:17:16,650
Because...

3919
03:17:18,630 --> 03:17:19,970
I hope so.

3920
03:17:22,270 --> 03:17:23,370
I didn't see her.

3921
03:17:23,890 --> 03:17:24,610
No idea.

3922
03:17:24,850 --> 03:17:25,210
That's okay.

3923
03:17:25,370 --> 03:17:26,950
I wonder if I can save in here.

3924
03:17:29,250 --> 03:17:29,650
Nope.

3925
03:17:32,990 --> 03:17:34,970
Oh, there's only one room left where dad could be.

3926
03:17:35,030 --> 03:17:36,050
I need to find him.

3927
03:17:39,370 --> 03:17:39,770
Okay.

3928
03:17:44,630 --> 03:17:45,030
Hopefully.

3929
03:17:45,850 --> 03:17:47,630
I don't want to have to do everything all over again.

3930
03:17:47,990 --> 03:17:48,390
Okay.

3931
03:17:49,250 --> 03:17:49,650
Okay.

3932
03:17:50,170 --> 03:17:51,930
They said trading a voucher auto saves.

3933
03:17:52,070 --> 03:17:53,250
Yeah, but it's like...

3934
03:17:56,630 --> 03:17:57,410
Annoying, you know?

3935
03:18:01,700 --> 03:18:03,880
I don't think it'll let me go back through the ball pit.

3936
03:18:04,080 --> 03:18:06,400
I think he's going to be like, no, I have to find my dad.

3937
03:18:06,560 --> 03:18:07,220
You know what I mean?

3938
03:18:09,480 --> 03:18:10,960
We have to go to the party room.

3939
03:18:11,660 --> 03:18:12,200
All right.

3940
03:18:17,070 --> 03:18:17,690
It's raining.

3941
03:18:18,890 --> 03:18:19,850
That's raining even.

3942
03:18:20,530 --> 03:18:20,890
Um...

3943
03:18:22,630 --> 03:18:23,890
What would be the best way?

3944
03:18:25,850 --> 03:18:28,190
The arcade is kind of hard because there are no hiding spots.

3945
03:18:31,190 --> 03:18:33,570
Honestly, through the storage or through the dining area...

3946
03:18:33,570 --> 03:18:35,050
Through the storage is probably the easier way.

3947
03:18:41,820 --> 03:18:43,180
But, the arcade first.

3948
03:18:44,200 --> 03:18:44,960
Okay, we'll try.

3949
03:18:45,180 --> 03:18:46,940
Okay, we'll try the balloon game first, you guys.

3950
03:18:47,040 --> 03:18:48,120
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3951
03:18:48,200 --> 03:18:48,960
Let me...

3952
03:18:48,960 --> 03:18:50,540
Give me a second.

3953
03:18:52,180 --> 03:18:52,920
Give me a second.

3954
03:18:56,720 --> 03:18:58,260
It's just the one game, right?

3955
03:18:58,800 --> 03:18:59,660
That there is?

3956
03:19:02,480 --> 03:19:03,680
I don't hear anyone.

3957
03:19:04,100 --> 03:19:06,220
Oh my god!

3958
03:19:07,780 --> 03:19:10,240
You guys, it's a good thing I didn't go to the arcade.

3959
03:19:10,300 --> 03:19:10,820
I'm just saying.

3960
03:19:12,320 --> 03:19:13,200
I think...

3961
03:19:13,980 --> 03:19:17,800
They added the sound of rain so I can't hear them walking around so much.

3962
03:19:20,740 --> 03:19:24,560
I think they added the sound of the rain so I can't hear them walking around so much.

3963
03:19:24,580 --> 03:19:25,260
I think they added the sound of the rain so I can't hear them walking around so much.

3964
03:19:31,720 --> 03:19:33,460
Can you please leave?

3965
03:19:33,800 --> 03:19:35,380
Actually, what if I go from here?

3966
03:19:55,740 --> 03:19:56,380
Alright.

3967
03:20:01,280 --> 03:20:01,920
SpongeBob.

3968
03:20:02,080 --> 03:20:02,720
SpongeBob.

3969
03:20:03,900 --> 03:20:05,180
SpongeBob SquarePants.

3970
03:20:05,460 --> 03:20:07,060
SpongeBob SquarePants.

3971
03:20:07,400 --> 03:20:08,980
SpongeBob SquarePants.

3972
03:20:09,120 --> 03:20:09,760
SpongeBob SquarePants.

3973
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:12,640
SpongeBob SquarePants.

3974
03:20:12,640 --> 03:20:14,820
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

3975
03:20:19,480 --> 03:20:21,400
There are multiple secret mini-games.

3976
03:20:21,540 --> 03:20:22,720
Oh, interesting.

3977
03:20:25,320 --> 03:20:28,440
Well, maybe playing just this one won't change an ending, but we'll see.

3978
03:20:30,420 --> 03:20:31,980
And then this is the front door area.

3979
03:20:33,800 --> 03:20:35,260
And then this is the dining hall.

3980
03:20:38,860 --> 03:20:39,960
Are you ready, kids?

3981
03:20:39,960 --> 03:20:41,580
Aye, aye, Captain.

3982
03:20:42,300 --> 03:20:44,000
I can't hear you.

3983
03:20:44,220 --> 03:20:45,680
Aye, aye, Captain.

3984
03:20:46,220 --> 03:20:46,880
Oh.

3985
03:20:48,980 --> 03:20:51,200
Who lived in a pineapple under the sea?

3986
03:20:53,640 --> 03:20:54,960
William Afton.

3987
03:20:57,790 --> 03:21:00,030
And this is the stage.

3988
03:21:01,350 --> 03:21:04,350
This is the backstage of the stage.

3989
03:21:09,670 --> 03:21:12,070
This is the ball pit.

3990
03:21:18,330 --> 03:21:20,070
I don't remember where the last one is.

3991
03:21:23,470 --> 03:21:23,910
Wait.

3992
03:21:24,010 --> 03:21:24,910
Oh, this is the kitchen.

3993
03:21:27,370 --> 03:21:28,170
Oh, here it is.

3994
03:21:29,670 --> 03:21:30,110
Aha!

3995
03:21:30,110 --> 03:21:31,010
I see, I see.

3996
03:21:31,150 --> 03:21:31,690
It opened up.

3997
03:21:32,510 --> 03:21:33,810
And this is the party room.

3998
03:21:35,470 --> 03:21:37,950
And inside the party room is... a dog.

3999
03:21:39,410 --> 03:21:40,290
And... what?

4000
03:22:05,190 --> 03:22:05,930
See you.

4001
03:22:09,410 --> 03:22:10,470
What the dog doing?

4002
03:22:10,470 --> 03:22:11,450
I don't know.

4003
03:22:11,450 --> 03:22:12,550
Eating that guy, I guess.

4004
03:22:25,350 --> 03:22:26,090
Oh, my gosh.

4005
03:22:26,090 --> 03:22:26,710
It scared me.

4006
03:22:27,790 --> 03:22:29,310
Let me out of here, you stupid rabbit!

4007
03:22:30,250 --> 03:22:31,470
Hey, are you alright in there?

4008
03:22:32,170 --> 03:22:34,090
I was locked in here by some strange rabbit.

4009
03:22:34,170 --> 03:22:36,090
Can you find a way to get me out?

4010
03:22:36,790 --> 03:22:37,630
I'll find something.

4011
03:22:38,070 --> 03:22:38,430
Okay.

4012
03:22:39,990 --> 03:22:41,710
So, it's not even my dad in there.

4013
03:22:45,270 --> 03:22:46,310
Oh, my gosh.

4014
03:22:46,370 --> 03:22:47,650
That was Chico, wasn't it?

4015
03:22:47,690 --> 03:22:48,210
Oh, my gosh.

4016
03:22:51,790 --> 03:22:53,650
Um... find a way to get her out?

4017
03:23:00,400 --> 03:23:01,580
How do I get her out?

4018
03:23:09,320 --> 03:23:11,760
Well, the ticket machine in the past let you save also.

4019
03:23:11,920 --> 03:23:12,480
I'm not sure.

4020
03:23:12,580 --> 03:23:13,020
I don't know.

4021
03:23:14,620 --> 03:23:16,220
What do I need to get her out?

4022
03:23:20,670 --> 03:23:23,510
Looks like... there's like a little red light.

4023
03:23:24,230 --> 03:23:25,350
Maybe it's a key card?

4024
03:23:26,150 --> 03:23:26,750
Or something?

4025
03:23:29,350 --> 03:23:29,750
Uh...

4026
03:23:32,210 --> 03:23:32,850
Oh, my God.

4027
03:23:32,890 --> 03:23:33,130
Please.

4028
03:23:33,290 --> 03:23:34,970
I can't stand listening to you anymore.

4029
03:23:36,170 --> 03:23:37,310
Oh, we're in the basement.

4030
03:23:37,830 --> 03:23:38,610
Oh, my gosh.

4031
03:23:39,490 --> 03:23:41,350
I forget where this one goes.

4032
03:23:44,390 --> 03:23:45,790
Maybe in the security room.

4033
03:23:47,390 --> 03:23:48,050
Oh, shoot.

4034
03:23:49,570 --> 03:23:50,890
Who just walked in here?

4035
03:24:06,480 --> 03:24:07,420
Does it show me?

4036
03:24:08,140 --> 03:24:10,420
Looks like the door opens with some kind of key card.

4037
03:24:10,840 --> 03:24:12,660
What kind of party room is that secure?

4038
03:24:13,300 --> 03:24:14,580
Okay, so it is a key card.

4039
03:24:20,860 --> 03:24:21,980
So, it may have been...

4040
03:24:21,980 --> 03:24:23,880
Will it be Springtrap, the Patriot's creation?

4041
03:24:24,120 --> 03:24:25,760
Or Oswald, Springtrap's play stick?

4042
03:24:26,020 --> 03:24:27,380
Our beloved monsters.

4043
03:24:28,760 --> 03:24:30,540
Well, maybe in security room, then.

4044
03:24:32,720 --> 03:24:35,200
Why is the objective still find dad, though?

4045
03:24:38,380 --> 03:24:41,080
I'm really worried about dying because of how...

4046
03:24:41,080 --> 03:24:42,820
I don't know if anything is saved.

4047
03:24:44,400 --> 03:24:44,960
No!

4048
03:25:01,530 --> 03:25:04,250
You have to go to the freezer to cool down the key card?

4049
03:25:07,230 --> 03:25:08,350
Oh, gosh.

4050
03:25:16,500 --> 03:25:18,680
Maybe if I check the cameras?

4051
03:25:23,720 --> 03:25:24,560
My room.

4052
03:25:31,360 --> 03:25:32,680
Springtrap's go into the...

4053
03:25:32,680 --> 03:25:33,820
To there.

4054
03:25:41,440 --> 03:25:42,940
Arcade is dark.

4055
03:25:42,940 --> 03:25:43,860
It's dark for some reason.

4056
03:25:45,200 --> 03:25:46,300
Dining area is dark.

4057
03:25:46,440 --> 03:25:47,520
Oh, they're always dark.

4058
03:25:47,720 --> 03:25:47,900
Look!

4059
03:25:48,060 --> 03:25:48,700
Look at the membership.

4060
03:25:48,840 --> 03:25:49,360
Thank you!

4061
03:25:50,200 --> 03:25:53,360
It's weird that we're in cam 7 but we can't hear her, you know?

4062
03:25:54,560 --> 03:25:56,380
We can't hear her being like...

4063
03:26:00,520 --> 03:26:01,320
I'm not sure!

4064
03:26:02,560 --> 03:26:03,720
Oh my god, please.

4065
03:26:04,380 --> 03:26:05,300
Don't do that to me.

4066
03:26:06,540 --> 03:26:07,500
I'm not sure!

4067
03:26:07,500 --> 03:26:07,660
A door!

4068
03:26:11,560 --> 03:26:12,440
A keycard.

4069
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:15,260
I guess we'll just have to explore for it, right?

4070
03:26:19,600 --> 03:26:20,340
I'm nervous.

4071
03:26:21,880 --> 03:26:25,740
I'm gonna see if anybody comes out because I'll go into the arcade and see if... wait.

4072
03:26:27,920 --> 03:26:29,520
I have a voucher but...

4073
03:26:31,060 --> 03:26:32,960
I don't know how many tickets I have.

4074
03:26:33,120 --> 03:26:35,900
I don't think I have enough tickets to get a new voucher.

4075
03:26:39,300 --> 03:26:40,100
No, guys!

4076
03:26:40,340 --> 03:26:41,200
Oh, guys!

4077
03:26:41,280 --> 03:26:42,560
Oh, golly, golly, guys!

4078
03:26:42,660 --> 03:26:43,020
You guys!

4079
03:26:45,020 --> 03:26:45,420
Okay.

4080
03:26:47,860 --> 03:26:49,140
I don't think I have enough tickets.

4081
03:26:49,700 --> 03:26:50,620
The cool is.

4082
03:26:55,470 --> 03:26:56,770
I'm officially out of drink.

4083
03:26:56,890 --> 03:26:57,850
Actually, no, that's a lie.

4084
03:26:57,970 --> 03:26:58,770
I have a water bottle.

4085
03:26:59,190 --> 03:27:00,110
I'm gonna go grab it.

4086
03:27:00,190 --> 03:27:00,910
Give me a second.

4087
03:27:01,970 --> 03:27:05,870
I'm gonna grab my water bottle and I'm also going to go to the bathroom real quick.

4088
03:27:07,030 --> 03:27:09,130
Because I've been drinking so much to try and keep my...

4089
03:27:09,130 --> 03:27:11,590
my throat hydrated but it's also making me have to go to the bathroom.

4090
03:27:11,730 --> 03:27:15,490
So, BRB for like a minute.

4091
03:27:16,910 --> 03:27:18,150
Give me one second.

4092
03:27:19,530 --> 03:27:20,010
Okay.

4093
03:27:21,390 --> 03:27:22,310
Potty break, everybody.

4094
03:27:22,550 --> 03:27:24,630
Let's all go to the little ghost's room together.

4095
03:27:25,530 --> 03:27:26,510
But separate stalls.

4096
03:27:26,850 --> 03:27:27,330
Okay.

4097
03:27:27,410 --> 03:27:29,030
Bye-bye for a second.

4098
03:29:10,110 --> 03:29:11,070
I am back.

4099
03:29:11,310 --> 03:29:12,090
I am back.

4100
03:29:12,250 --> 03:29:12,750
I am back.

4101
03:29:14,850 --> 03:29:15,730
Okey-dokey.

4102
03:29:15,870 --> 03:29:16,790
I have a question.

4103
03:29:16,790 --> 03:29:20,850
When you guys go to the bathroom in like your own house, do you shut the door?

4104
03:29:21,890 --> 03:29:23,110
If you're home alone, you know?

4105
03:29:25,490 --> 03:29:26,510
Or do you...

4106
03:29:29,130 --> 03:29:30,290
leave the door open?

4107
03:29:31,910 --> 03:29:32,770
Do you wash your hands?

4108
03:29:32,810 --> 03:29:33,370
Yeah, of course.

4109
03:29:33,910 --> 03:29:34,870
Yeah, I shut the door.

4110
03:29:35,150 --> 03:29:36,130
If home alone, why?

4111
03:29:36,430 --> 03:29:36,930
I don't know.

4112
03:29:37,010 --> 03:29:38,270
Like it feels wrong...

4113
03:29:39,010 --> 03:29:41,250
to leave the door open even if I'm home alone.

4114
03:29:42,390 --> 03:29:42,910
You know?

4115
03:29:44,510 --> 03:29:44,870
Like...

4116
03:29:45,490 --> 03:29:46,210
Like here...

4117
03:29:46,210 --> 03:29:46,610
I...

4118
03:29:46,610 --> 03:29:48,330
I'm in my own hotel room, right?

4119
03:29:48,370 --> 03:29:48,730
By myself.

4120
03:29:48,830 --> 03:29:49,730
But I still shut the door.

4121
03:30:00,080 --> 03:30:01,240
It feels so right.

4122
03:30:01,360 --> 03:30:01,660
What?

4123
03:30:01,740 --> 03:30:02,200
To shut it?

4124
03:30:02,340 --> 03:30:02,560
Or...

4125
03:30:02,560 --> 03:30:03,220
I have pets.

4126
03:30:03,420 --> 03:30:04,860
No such thing as alone.

4127
03:30:07,660 --> 03:30:08,040
My...

4128
03:30:08,040 --> 03:30:11,300
My cats don't care about if I'm going to the bathroom.

4129
03:30:18,830 --> 03:30:21,050
What if someone breaks into your house while you have your door open?

4130
03:30:21,090 --> 03:30:21,910
That's what I was...

4131
03:30:21,910 --> 03:30:22,470
Oh my gosh.

4132
03:30:22,870 --> 03:30:23,250
You...

4133
03:30:23,250 --> 03:30:26,090
I was literally thinking the same exact thing.

4134
03:30:27,250 --> 03:30:29,550
I was like, what if someone...

4135
03:30:30,290 --> 03:30:33,650
bursts into my home and I have my door wide open?

4136
03:30:35,010 --> 03:30:38,490
I leave the door open singing, leave the door open.

4137
03:30:39,310 --> 03:30:42,110
I'ma leave the door open.

4138
03:30:43,110 --> 03:30:45,530
I'ma leave the door open.

4139
03:30:45,990 --> 03:30:48,830
I'ma leave the door open.

4140
03:30:51,070 --> 03:30:51,550
Okay.

4141
03:30:53,730 --> 03:30:54,670
What kind of...

4142
03:30:54,670 --> 03:30:54,950
Okay.

4143
03:30:55,010 --> 03:30:55,630
A key card.

4144
03:30:55,930 --> 03:30:57,850
If I were a key card...

4145
03:31:01,500 --> 03:31:08,140
Now, I don't think we go back to the present because the door for the party room is blocked off in the present.

4146
03:31:08,220 --> 03:31:09,360
So why would there be...

4147
03:31:10,420 --> 03:31:17,000
Why would there even be, you know, a reason to have a key card in the present?

4148
03:31:17,400 --> 03:31:18,720
Oh my gosh.

4149
03:31:19,860 --> 03:31:20,360
Holy crap.

4150
03:31:20,360 --> 03:31:20,600
Oh my gosh.

4151
03:31:20,600 --> 03:31:20,660
Holy crap.

4152
03:31:23,980 --> 03:31:24,860
Oh my gosh.

4153
03:31:24,860 --> 03:31:26,440
You guys are killing me.

4154
03:31:28,900 --> 03:31:30,520
You guys are killing me!

4155
03:31:33,080 --> 03:31:33,960
Oh my gosh.

4156
03:31:36,220 --> 03:31:37,100
Where else?

4157
03:31:37,200 --> 03:31:38,540
Where, where will it be?

4158
03:31:41,980 --> 03:31:44,820
The thing you said about Oz not wanting to return to the present is correct.

4159
03:31:44,980 --> 03:31:45,180
Okay.

4160
03:31:46,160 --> 03:31:46,600
Yeah.

4161
03:31:46,660 --> 03:31:47,840
I figured that was going to be the case.

4162
03:31:47,920 --> 03:31:49,980
If I were a key card...

4163
03:31:49,980 --> 03:31:50,640
I was...

4164
03:31:55,080 --> 03:31:56,440
Where would it be?

4165
03:32:03,150 --> 03:32:04,590
We've done the kitchen?

4166
03:32:07,910 --> 03:32:09,890
We've done... like the...

4167
03:32:13,560 --> 03:32:14,580
Enjoy the rest of the game.

4168
03:32:14,640 --> 03:32:14,960
Thank you!

4169
03:32:17,640 --> 03:32:18,520
Oh my gosh.

4170
03:32:19,160 --> 03:32:19,640
Chica.

4171
03:32:20,340 --> 03:32:21,780
It's in a really weird spot.

4172
03:32:22,020 --> 03:32:22,280
Okay.

4173
03:32:26,900 --> 03:32:28,340
Perhaps the basement.

4174
03:32:28,360 --> 03:32:29,120
We'll go look.

4175
03:32:29,120 --> 03:32:31,460
I guess we just gotta kind of look around.

4176
03:32:31,820 --> 03:32:34,420
And see where it's been dropped, I suppose.

4177
03:32:37,380 --> 03:32:38,600
Shaking down the guard.

4178
03:32:38,960 --> 03:32:39,880
You guys...

4179
03:32:39,880 --> 03:32:42,300
Do I have brain rot or do you?

4180
03:32:46,580 --> 03:32:47,620
Chica, please leave.

4181
03:32:47,960 --> 03:32:48,880
Get out of here.

4182
03:32:48,980 --> 03:32:49,300
Thank you.

4183
03:32:50,460 --> 03:32:51,760
Can I get a pita?

4184
03:32:54,600 --> 03:32:55,080
Pita.

4185
03:32:56,280 --> 03:32:57,580
The chicken is here.

4186
03:33:00,620 --> 03:33:00,980
No.

4187
03:33:01,520 --> 03:33:03,220
Now I have to wait for her to leave again.

4188
03:33:03,420 --> 03:33:04,280
Cause that's where I gotta go.

4189
03:33:04,960 --> 03:33:06,100
Oh my god.

4190
03:33:07,180 --> 03:33:09,440
You guys just don't quit it.

4191
03:33:13,620 --> 03:33:14,960
We learned it from you, dad.

4192
03:33:16,480 --> 03:33:17,800
Oh, this is gonna be aw- You know what?

4193
03:33:17,900 --> 03:33:18,740
I think I have to do it.

4194
03:33:20,360 --> 03:33:21,560
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

4195
03:33:27,260 --> 03:33:27,620
Okay.

4196
03:33:30,180 --> 03:33:30,540
Okay.

4197
03:33:42,020 --> 03:33:45,020
How do you always run right to where I'm under?

4198
03:33:45,580 --> 03:33:47,200
Without even knowing where I am.

4199
03:33:47,660 --> 03:33:47,700
Huh?

4200
03:33:48,080 --> 03:33:49,780
Oh, that's kind of...

4201
03:33:50,820 --> 03:33:51,300
Stop!

4202
03:33:51,780 --> 03:33:52,680
Go away!

4203
03:33:56,120 --> 03:33:57,080
Go away!

4204
03:33:59,460 --> 03:34:01,620
Okay, so I think he just went into the kitchen?

4205
03:34:06,170 --> 03:34:07,130
And Chica...

4206
03:34:08,190 --> 03:34:09,210
Went into the kitchen.

4207
03:34:16,510 --> 03:34:17,230
What the?

4208
03:34:17,330 --> 03:34:17,850
Wait.

4209
03:34:19,210 --> 03:34:20,530
They won't let me backstage!

4210
03:34:22,750 --> 03:34:23,350
Okay.

4211
03:34:23,410 --> 03:34:23,990
Interesting.

4212
03:34:24,530 --> 03:34:25,810
Okay, interesting, interesting.

4213
03:34:26,090 --> 03:34:26,650
So they're...

4214
03:34:26,650 --> 03:34:28,630
They're partying it up there.

4215
03:34:29,030 --> 03:34:29,630
In...

4216
03:34:29,630 --> 03:34:29,950
Okay.

4217
03:34:30,490 --> 03:34:31,070
Okay.

4218
03:34:31,110 --> 03:34:33,410
So the keycard is not in the basement.

4219
03:34:33,930 --> 03:34:34,530
Unless...

4220
03:34:34,530 --> 03:34:36,390
It is in the basement and I have to...

4221
03:34:38,030 --> 03:34:39,990
I probably have to...

4222
03:34:40,730 --> 03:34:41,330
Okay.

4223
03:34:41,350 --> 03:34:43,590
I have to get there through the vents.

4224
03:34:43,590 --> 03:34:45,030
Which vent does it again?

4225
03:34:45,170 --> 03:34:46,190
The party hallway.

4226
03:34:46,510 --> 03:34:47,090
Oh, shoot.

4227
03:34:47,270 --> 03:34:47,490
Okay.

4228
03:34:59,220 --> 03:35:01,440
This is the party hallway door, right?

4229
03:35:01,580 --> 03:35:02,000
Yes.

4230
03:35:12,600 --> 03:35:13,760
Please don't be in here.

4231
03:35:18,760 --> 03:35:19,580
Oh, okay.

4232
03:35:19,700 --> 03:35:20,540
It's just Chica.

4233
03:35:20,860 --> 03:35:21,760
Oh my gosh.

4234
03:35:22,260 --> 03:35:23,040
Oh my gosh.

4235
03:35:23,060 --> 03:35:23,680
Scared me.

4236
03:35:23,700 --> 03:35:24,820
Scared me so bad.

4237
03:35:25,940 --> 03:35:27,560
Scared me so bad.

4238
03:35:28,820 --> 03:35:29,780
Oh my gosh.

4239
03:35:29,780 --> 03:35:30,320
Oh my gosh.

4240
03:35:30,500 --> 03:35:30,820
Oh my gosh.

4241
03:35:30,880 --> 03:35:31,280
Oh my gosh.

4242
03:35:31,340 --> 03:35:32,120
Oh my gooooood.

4243
03:35:48,660 --> 03:35:54,700
All right, now you get out of here, go to the kitchen where you belong.

4244
03:36:09,760 --> 03:36:10,120
Okay.

4245
03:36:16,950 --> 03:36:19,130
Actually, why would a rabbit belong in the kitchen?

4246
03:36:20,070 --> 03:36:21,050
I don't even understand that.

4247
03:36:21,050 --> 03:36:21,790
I don't understand my own joke.

4248
03:36:25,370 --> 03:36:25,910
Weird.

4249
03:36:26,430 --> 03:36:26,970
Anyway.

4250
03:36:34,290 --> 03:36:35,290
Rabbit soup.

4251
03:36:43,860 --> 03:36:44,700
Oh, what's that?

4252
03:36:44,900 --> 03:36:45,440
Eat?

4253
03:36:45,780 --> 03:36:46,980
Best to leave this alone?

4254
03:36:48,200 --> 03:36:49,280
Worry the... oh.

4255
03:36:49,440 --> 03:36:50,560
I thought it was sparkling.

4256
03:36:51,160 --> 03:36:51,840
That's why.

4257
03:36:54,620 --> 03:36:55,580
Let's check in here.

4258
03:36:57,700 --> 03:36:59,640
Where did all these things come from?

4259
03:37:01,260 --> 03:37:02,220
Is that the keycard?

4260
03:37:03,980 --> 03:37:05,540
Dang it, I thought that was... whoa!

4261
03:37:07,640 --> 03:37:08,480
Endoskeleton galore.

4262
03:37:11,300 --> 03:37:11,720
Okay.

4263
03:37:11,720 --> 03:37:14,120
It looks like there's something shoved inside one of them.

4264
03:37:15,120 --> 03:37:16,440
Is this the... is this it?

4265
03:37:19,220 --> 03:37:20,220
I got it.

4266
03:37:29,220 --> 03:37:30,040
I got it!

4267
03:37:38,050 --> 03:37:38,910
Ah, he's in.

4268
03:37:39,110 --> 03:37:39,750
Springtrap's in here.

4269
03:37:41,010 --> 03:37:42,590
Give me a second, you guys.

4270
03:37:42,950 --> 03:37:43,770
Give me a second.

4271
03:37:47,370 --> 03:37:48,270
Is he gone?

4272
03:37:52,500 --> 03:37:53,460
I don't hear him.

4273
03:37:53,720 --> 03:37:55,400
But I didn't hear a door open either.

4274
03:38:12,200 --> 03:38:13,560
Oh my god, we're finally in here.

4275
03:38:17,340 --> 03:38:17,880
Thank you.

4276
03:38:17,940 --> 03:38:18,880
I thought I was done for.

4277
03:38:19,700 --> 03:38:21,460
Before you get out of here, I'm looking for my dad.

4278
03:38:22,260 --> 03:38:23,020
Have you seen him?

4279
03:38:23,600 --> 03:38:25,240
No, I haven't seen anyone else.

4280
03:38:25,900 --> 03:38:27,140
But I'm... I've been here.

4281
03:38:27,140 --> 03:38:29,080
I'm hearing weird noises coming through the vent in here.

4282
03:38:29,980 --> 03:38:31,760
I definitely heard a man mumbling.

4283
03:38:31,940 --> 03:38:32,780
And snoring?

4284
03:38:33,860 --> 03:38:35,360
Oh man, that's gotta be him.

4285
03:38:36,040 --> 03:38:37,940
I think you're clear to run straight to the exit.

4286
03:38:38,060 --> 03:38:38,620
Just be careful.

4287
03:38:38,920 --> 03:38:39,340
Okay.

4288
03:38:39,440 --> 03:38:39,940
Good luck.

4289
03:38:40,440 --> 03:38:41,400
Oh, it's saved!

4290
03:38:41,640 --> 03:38:42,960
Oh, good it saved, you guys.

4291
03:38:43,180 --> 03:38:43,620
Nice.

4292
03:38:50,110 --> 03:38:51,190
What's in here anyway?

4293
03:38:51,650 --> 03:38:52,710
Don't touch that.

4294
03:38:55,090 --> 03:38:56,350
Alright, into the vent we...

4295
03:38:57,430 --> 03:38:58,010
What's this?

4296
03:38:58,050 --> 03:38:58,410
A photo!

4297
03:38:58,410 --> 03:39:00,330
Looks like it's pretty scratched up.

4298
03:39:02,650 --> 03:39:03,630
Wait, what?

4299
03:39:04,650 --> 03:39:05,650
Strange photo?

4300
03:39:05,770 --> 03:39:08,430
An odd photo of two men inside of a strange office.

4301
03:39:09,010 --> 03:39:11,770
Is this somewhere inside of Freddy's?

4302
03:39:13,670 --> 03:39:14,190
Interesting!

4303
03:39:20,260 --> 03:39:20,780
Dad!

4304
03:39:22,180 --> 03:39:23,100
Dad, you're alive!

4305
03:39:26,600 --> 03:39:27,620
Who's looking at me?

4306
03:39:28,340 --> 03:39:28,860
Dad?

4307
03:39:29,060 --> 03:39:29,460
Dad?

4308
03:39:29,680 --> 03:39:30,180
Dad?

4309
03:39:30,440 --> 03:39:30,860
Dad?

4310
03:39:36,280 --> 03:39:37,540
Are you awake?

4311
03:39:40,560 --> 03:39:41,080
Oh.

4312
03:39:41,080 --> 03:39:41,600
Dad.

4313
03:39:41,860 --> 03:39:42,160
Come...

4314
03:39:42,160 --> 03:39:43,160
Come on, Dad.

4315
03:39:44,940 --> 03:39:46,480
Sounds like something's trying to get in.

4316
03:39:46,520 --> 03:39:47,020
I better hide.

4317
03:39:48,560 --> 03:39:49,600
But what about Dad?

4318
03:39:56,670 --> 03:39:57,190
He's...

4319
03:39:57,190 --> 03:39:58,490
Sleep stand...

4320
03:39:58,490 --> 03:39:58,570
Oh.

4321
03:39:59,130 --> 03:39:59,650
No!

4322
03:40:02,430 --> 03:40:04,510
No, you're not taking him away again!

4323
03:40:04,510 --> 03:40:06,590
Oh my god, you're so brave, Ozzy.

4324
03:40:07,690 --> 03:40:09,170
What else is in here?

4325
03:40:09,290 --> 03:40:09,850
Anything else?

4326
03:40:10,210 --> 03:40:10,710
No?

4327
03:40:10,890 --> 03:40:11,370
Okay.

4328
03:40:12,830 --> 03:40:13,930
Where are we?

4329
03:40:14,590 --> 03:40:15,350
The basement?

4330
03:40:15,530 --> 03:40:15,850
Great.

4331
03:40:16,090 --> 03:40:17,530
That bear is out there.

4332
03:40:18,070 --> 03:40:18,410
Oh.

4333
03:40:21,450 --> 03:40:21,970
Okay.

4334
03:40:22,470 --> 03:40:23,590
What does that mean?

4335
03:40:25,550 --> 03:40:26,750
Wait, I just realized...

4336
03:40:31,160 --> 03:40:33,200
This is just a covert assignment.

4337
03:40:33,800 --> 03:40:34,460
Hold on.

4338
03:40:34,500 --> 03:40:35,200
Where are we?

4339
03:40:36,760 --> 03:40:37,200
Oh.

4340
03:40:37,560 --> 03:40:38,000
Oh.

4341
03:40:38,380 --> 03:40:39,240
We're just...

4342
03:40:39,240 --> 03:40:40,040
Somewhere.

4343
03:40:41,280 --> 03:40:42,480
What do I do with Freddy?

4344
03:40:44,700 --> 03:40:45,960
Freddy's blocking the door?

4345
03:40:46,060 --> 03:40:46,860
We gotta take his hat.

4346
03:40:47,080 --> 03:40:47,920
Isn't that what the book said?

4347
03:40:48,180 --> 03:40:49,520
We gotta do something with his hat?

4348
03:40:50,040 --> 03:40:50,480
Wait.

4349
03:40:52,480 --> 03:40:52,920
Sketchbook.

4350
03:40:54,080 --> 03:40:54,520
Um...

4351
03:40:57,280 --> 03:40:57,720
No...

4352
03:40:57,720 --> 03:40:58,920
Glue hat to head.

4353
03:40:59,800 --> 03:41:00,240
Um...

4354
03:41:01,380 --> 03:41:01,820
Oh!

4355
03:41:01,940 --> 03:41:02,680
The flashlight!

4356
03:41:02,980 --> 03:41:03,440
Never mind!

4357
03:41:03,440 --> 03:41:04,240
That's the flashlight!

4358
03:41:13,900 --> 03:41:14,960
What do I try now?

4359
03:41:15,140 --> 03:41:15,740
Oh, okay.

4360
03:41:16,240 --> 03:41:17,020
Just kidding.

4361
03:41:18,540 --> 03:41:19,080
Um...

4362
03:41:20,740 --> 03:41:22,260
There's nothing over here.

4363
03:41:24,040 --> 03:41:24,580
Uh...

4364
03:41:25,360 --> 03:41:26,620
Go after Springtrap?

4365
03:41:26,780 --> 03:41:26,940
Uh...

4366
03:41:26,940 --> 03:41:27,900
Do you...

4367
03:41:27,900 --> 03:41:29,240
What do you think I'm doing?

4368
03:41:32,380 --> 03:41:35,220
What do you think I'm trying to do?

4369
03:41:39,280 --> 03:41:41,020
Where do you think Springtrap went?

4370
03:41:43,160 --> 03:41:43,860
Why do I...

4371
03:41:43,860 --> 03:41:45,080
Why can I still hear the girl?

4372
03:41:46,000 --> 03:41:46,700
Wait a second.

4373
03:41:46,880 --> 03:41:47,280
So...

4374
03:41:47,280 --> 03:41:48,520
But where did he go?

4375
03:41:48,660 --> 03:41:49,440
That's the issue.

4376
03:41:51,700 --> 03:41:52,140
Um...

4377
03:41:57,240 --> 03:41:57,900
Save that.

4378
03:41:59,020 --> 03:42:00,260
Maybe I check the cameras?

4379
03:42:01,500 --> 03:42:02,280
Oh my god!

4380
03:42:02,340 --> 03:42:03,200
Oh my god!

4381
03:42:03,280 --> 03:42:04,020
So cheap.

4382
03:42:06,900 --> 03:42:07,560
What the...

4383
03:42:07,560 --> 03:42:07,780
Oh.

4384
03:42:07,960 --> 03:42:08,400
Oh!

4385
03:42:12,540 --> 03:42:14,140
The ball pit's down.

4386
03:42:21,030 --> 03:42:21,770
Uh...

4387
03:42:28,100 --> 03:42:30,320
I guess we'll go try the ball pit.

4388
03:42:35,230 --> 03:42:38,210
It's saved, so I'm not so concerned anymore.

4389
03:42:41,470 --> 03:42:42,370
We'll see.

4390
03:42:52,940 --> 03:42:54,660
Oh my god!

4391
03:43:03,000 --> 03:43:03,740
Wait.

4392
03:43:03,760 --> 03:43:04,300
I dropped something.

4393
03:43:04,880 --> 03:43:06,260
Oh my god!

4394
03:43:14,640 --> 03:43:15,600
Oh my god!

4395
03:43:15,680 --> 03:43:16,200
Oh my god!

4396
03:43:17,480 --> 03:43:18,600
It's kind of awesome.

4397
03:43:18,840 --> 03:43:19,240
Oh my god!

4398
03:43:19,280 --> 03:43:20,680
The animation is so awesome!

4399
03:43:28,730 --> 03:43:29,250
Oh wait.

4400
03:43:29,270 --> 03:43:30,270
Did he see the photo?

4401
03:43:30,710 --> 03:43:34,510
Do you think he saw the photo of... of, like, William Afton, right?

4402
03:43:35,570 --> 03:43:36,810
And it freaked him out?

4403
03:43:37,690 --> 03:43:39,490
Was that the photo I dropped, I wonder?

4404
03:43:40,110 --> 03:43:40,550
Oh!

4405
03:43:41,290 --> 03:43:42,730
So it's a good thing I picked it up!

4406
03:43:43,910 --> 03:43:44,350
Dad!

4407
03:43:44,470 --> 03:43:44,770
Dad!

4408
03:43:47,830 --> 03:43:48,190
No!

4409
03:43:48,330 --> 03:43:48,890
Not dead!

4410
03:43:49,010 --> 03:43:49,830
Please don't be dead!

4411
03:43:50,550 --> 03:43:50,910
Oh!

4412
03:43:51,430 --> 03:43:51,790
Oh!

4413
03:43:51,850 --> 03:43:52,150
He's alive!

4414
03:43:53,090 --> 03:43:53,750
What the...

4415
03:43:54,590 --> 03:43:55,870
What the heck is that thing?

4416
03:43:56,830 --> 03:43:57,910
What happened, Oswald?

4417
03:43:59,050 --> 03:44:02,890
So I hid in the ball pit to play a prank on you, which I shouldn't have done!

4418
03:44:03,530 --> 03:44:05,450
You came to look for me and slipped on a ball.

4419
03:44:05,650 --> 03:44:07,270
Must have hit your head pretty hard when you fell.

4420
03:44:08,230 --> 03:44:08,990
I'm sorry, Dad.

4421
03:44:09,150 --> 03:44:10,870
I didn't mean for things to get so out of hand.

4422
03:44:10,990 --> 03:44:11,110
Yeah.

4423
03:44:11,130 --> 03:44:14,750
Well, we're just not going to explain the animatronic bunny there, right?

4424
03:44:14,770 --> 03:44:17,610
I accept your apology, Os.

4425
03:44:17,810 --> 03:44:18,410
But you're right.

4426
03:44:18,530 --> 03:44:19,370
You shouldn't have done it.

4427
03:44:19,930 --> 03:44:20,850
Let's get out of here.

4428
03:44:21,650 --> 03:44:22,090
Okay.

4429
03:44:23,090 --> 03:44:24,850
Go to the hospital, please.

4430
03:44:25,390 --> 03:44:26,230
You were...

4431
03:44:26,230 --> 03:44:28,390
You and I are beat up pretty good, Os.

4432
03:44:28,450 --> 03:44:28,930
What happened?

4433
03:44:29,870 --> 03:44:31,050
You don't remember anything?

4434
03:44:33,090 --> 03:44:35,890
Well, considering this massive lump on my noggin...

4435
03:44:36,370 --> 03:44:36,810
Nope.

4436
03:44:37,570 --> 03:44:39,590
Go to the hospital, please!

4437
03:44:40,930 --> 03:44:41,370
Oh...

4438
03:44:42,370 --> 03:44:44,750
I was mad at you for being like this.

4439
03:44:44,770 --> 03:44:46,090
It's too late to pick me up again.

4440
03:44:47,010 --> 03:44:50,210
So I decided to hide from you to make you feel as annoyed as I was.

4441
03:44:50,550 --> 03:44:52,410
You slipped on a ball and got knocked out.

4442
03:44:54,570 --> 03:44:55,370
I'm sorry, Dad.

4443
03:44:55,470 --> 03:44:56,830
But your arm...

4444
03:44:57,630 --> 03:44:58,530
Oh my gosh.

4445
03:44:58,590 --> 03:44:59,710
What if it's like a zombie virus?

4446
03:44:59,890 --> 03:45:01,070
Is he going to become Springtrap?

4447
03:45:02,930 --> 03:45:03,650
Oh, Os.

4448
03:45:04,530 --> 03:45:04,890
Yeah.

4449
03:45:04,950 --> 03:45:05,190
You...

4450
03:45:05,190 --> 03:45:06,610
You have a concussion, probably.

4451
03:45:07,350 --> 03:45:08,450
I'm the one who's sorry.

4452
03:45:08,810 --> 03:45:10,910
Things haven't been fair for you at all lately.

4453
03:45:11,170 --> 03:45:13,070
And it's up to me and your mom to keep you happy.

4454
03:45:13,650 --> 03:45:14,370
That hairstyle.

4455
03:45:14,510 --> 03:45:14,750
Must have hurt.

4456
03:45:14,750 --> 03:45:15,470
It must be genetic.

4457
03:45:17,370 --> 03:45:20,650
Os is going to grow up just to look like his dad, exactly.

4458
03:45:21,670 --> 03:45:24,430
He didn't get a single feature from his mom.

4459
03:45:28,170 --> 03:45:32,490
I certainly haven't lived up to my end of the bargain ever since the mill closed, so...

4460
03:45:34,090 --> 03:45:39,010
I think it's time your mom and I talk about moving somewhere better for all of us.

4461
03:45:39,190 --> 03:45:40,030
Even Grandma.

4462
03:45:41,090 --> 03:45:44,610
I'm sure there's industrial-grade bubble wrap out there just for her.

4463
03:45:44,750 --> 03:45:45,350
Aww.

4464
03:45:45,850 --> 03:45:46,490
Really?

4465
03:45:47,270 --> 03:45:47,910
Really.

4466
03:45:49,150 --> 03:45:50,930
Now let's get you patched up.

4467
03:45:51,330 --> 03:45:51,970
Dad.

4468
03:45:54,870 --> 03:45:59,810
By the way, I think I may be suspended from school.

4469
03:46:00,790 --> 03:46:01,430
What?

4470
03:46:02,990 --> 03:46:03,790
It's fine.

4471
03:46:03,850 --> 03:46:04,170
We're leaving.

4472
03:46:04,370 --> 03:46:04,550
Oh.

4473
03:46:04,850 --> 03:46:08,130
Achieve two-star ending in either creepy or frightening mode.

4474
03:46:15,340 --> 03:46:15,660
Yay!

4475
03:46:16,200 --> 03:46:17,500
What's a two-star ending?

4476
03:46:18,720 --> 03:46:19,360
Oh.

4477
03:46:24,760 --> 03:46:25,740
Oh.

4478
03:46:26,480 --> 03:46:27,060
Oh.

4479
03:46:27,540 --> 03:46:28,120
There's...

4480
03:46:32,160 --> 03:46:33,060
What the...?

4481
03:46:36,060 --> 03:46:37,620
What is this song?

4482
03:47:19,040 --> 03:47:21,820
Is this a song made for this game?

4483
03:47:26,120 --> 03:47:27,860
Is he a- is he saying The Pit?

4484
03:47:28,360 --> 03:47:30,300
Something from the Piiit...

4485
03:47:30,300 --> 03:47:31,720
Oh, voice is from the pits!

4486
03:47:32,100 --> 03:47:33,040
No way!

4487
03:47:36,220 --> 03:47:37,440
Oh, God!

4488
03:47:37,500 --> 03:47:37,920
There he is.

4489
03:47:40,740 --> 03:47:43,280
The pits are calling out to me you guys.

4490
03:47:43,820 --> 03:47:45,700
The pits are calling to me.

4491
03:47:50,870 --> 03:47:52,690
Voices from the pits.

4492
03:47:55,390 --> 03:47:56,410
Walkie walkie.

4493
03:47:57,610 --> 03:47:59,430
Wow this is so fun though.

4494
03:47:59,750 --> 03:48:03,390
Thank you for playing.

4495
03:48:04,630 --> 03:48:07,990
Thank you for letting me play.

4496
03:48:08,370 --> 03:48:09,830
No music.

4497
03:48:09,970 --> 03:48:11,450
Jeff's Pizza Dining Hall.

4498
03:48:11,590 --> 03:48:12,870
Freddy Fazbear's Dining Hall.

4499
03:48:15,650 --> 03:48:16,550
What else is there?

4500
03:48:17,050 --> 03:48:18,010
Oh Jeff!

4501
03:48:18,810 --> 03:48:23,390
That kid better not have gotten hurt in there.

4502
03:48:23,510 --> 03:48:24,170
Oh there's blood!

4503
03:48:25,650 --> 03:48:27,370
TV table straight thanks for the 10 gifted.

4504
03:48:27,930 --> 03:48:28,270
Uh oh.

4505
03:48:28,350 --> 03:48:28,810
Wait Jeff.

4506
03:48:29,050 --> 03:48:29,690
Jeff no.

4507
03:48:29,850 --> 03:48:30,870
Oh Jeff Jeff Jeff.

4508
03:48:31,110 --> 03:48:32,450
Oh Jeff no no no.

4509
03:48:35,230 --> 03:48:35,710
Jeff!

4510
03:48:42,230 --> 03:48:44,350
I knew that was gonna happen.

4511
03:48:46,250 --> 03:48:47,170
Rip Jeff.

4512
03:48:52,380 --> 03:48:54,900
Can we really consider that a good end?

4513
03:48:55,040 --> 03:48:56,340
Jeff did nothing wrong.

4514
03:48:56,700 --> 03:48:58,940
Actually but also Jeff did nothing right.

4515
03:48:59,200 --> 03:49:02,360
Oh you can't see because chat but I have two stars up here.

4516
03:49:06,240 --> 03:49:06,760
Nice.

4517
03:49:07,820 --> 03:49:09,440
There is a true end.

4518
03:49:10,160 --> 03:49:12,480
You saved Jeff for the third three star ending.

4519
03:49:12,700 --> 03:49:14,200
How do I save Jeff?

4520
03:49:15,620 --> 03:49:17,120
I fixed all the machines.

4521
03:49:17,340 --> 03:49:18,500
What else could I have done?

4522
03:49:20,360 --> 03:49:22,260
What else could I have done to save Jeff?

4523
03:49:28,490 --> 03:49:28,970
Hmm.

4524
03:49:29,670 --> 03:49:30,590
It's complicated.

4525
03:49:32,490 --> 03:49:35,210
Ah the secret mini games.

4526
03:49:37,350 --> 03:49:41,210
I have to play all the hidden mini games.

4527
03:49:44,190 --> 03:49:45,610
I see I see I see.

4528
03:49:48,550 --> 03:49:50,090
Voices from the pit.

4529
03:49:51,210 --> 03:49:53,790
Thanks for the five gifted.

4530
03:49:54,070 --> 03:49:54,950
Check the achievements.

4531
03:49:55,170 --> 03:49:55,790
Yeah let's check them.

4532
03:49:55,970 --> 03:49:56,530
Let's look at them.

4533
03:49:57,330 --> 03:49:58,190
Actually are they?

4534
03:49:58,250 --> 03:49:58,810
Yeah here they are.

4535
03:50:00,370 --> 03:50:01,710

Mystery.

4539
03:50:10,470 --> 03:50:12,430
Finish the game without turning on the flashlight.

4540
03:50:12,710 --> 03:50:13,710
Hiding not included.

4541
03:50:13,850 --> 03:50:14,090
Okay.

4542
03:50:14,110 --> 03:50:16,110
Complete the game without getting caught.

4543
03:50:18,090 --> 03:50:22,010
Master of s... Is that a box?

4544
03:50:23,890 --> 03:50:25,190
Is that a cardboard box?

4545
03:50:26,130 --> 03:50:27,490
Is that a cardboard box?

4546
03:50:27,710 --> 03:50:28,190
I'd rather not.

4547
03:50:28,290 --> 03:50:29,090
Thanks for the five gifted.

4548
03:50:29,430 --> 03:50:30,170
Is that a cardboard?

4549
03:50:30,290 --> 03:50:31,650
Is that him hiding in a cardboard box?

4550
03:50:32,130 --> 03:50:33,750
Is that him hiding in a cardboard box?

4551
03:50:39,940 --> 03:50:42,020
Meet Jinx in a room 10 times.

4552
03:50:42,080 --> 03:50:42,320
Oh.

4553
03:50:44,920 --> 03:50:45,840
Triggered chicas a lot.

4554
03:50:45,840 --> 03:50:45,840
I don't know.

4555
03:50:45,840 --> 03:50:45,840
I don't know.

4556
03:50:45,840 --> 03:50:46,120
I don't know.

4557
03:50:46,120 --> 03:50:46,120
I agree.

4558
03:50:46,440 --> 03:50:46,920
Forgetting against all odds.

4559
03:50:46,920 --> 03:50:47,600
Get grabbed by Bonnie.

4560
03:50:47,860 --> 03:50:48,600
Oh I did that.

4561
03:50:48,740 --> 03:50:48,900
Oh.

4562
03:50:48,920 --> 03:50:49,640
These ones are...

4563
03:50:55,500 --> 03:50:55,980
Sorry.

4564
03:50:57,080 --> 03:50:57,580
Sorry.

4565
03:51:02,020 --> 03:51:03,020
Dial 911.

4566
03:51:03,220 --> 03:51:03,460
Mystery.

4567
03:51:03,860 --> 03:51:04,040
Mystery.

4568
03:51:07,340 --> 03:51:08,720
Not a gamer.

4569
03:51:10,220 --> 03:51:11,280
Honk Freddy's nose.

4570
03:51:11,620 --> 03:51:12,180
Give me five.

4571
03:51:12,300 --> 03:51:13,660
Find all the clues about dad.

4572
03:51:15,500 --> 03:51:16,500
The guys.

4573
03:51:17,880 --> 03:51:18,500
Bless you.

4574
03:51:18,560 --> 03:51:18,980
Thank you!

4575
03:51:19,580 --> 03:51:20,700
I should go blow my nose.

4576
03:51:22,720 --> 03:51:23,540
See ya, dad.

4577
03:51:23,560 --> 03:51:24,300
Left dad behind.

4578
03:51:25,980 --> 03:51:28,020
Achieve two star ending in either creepy or friendly way.

4579
03:51:28,040 --> 03:51:28,320
Geoff!

4580
03:51:29,500 --> 03:51:30,860
Geoff, I'm so sorry!

4581
03:51:31,160 --> 03:51:32,040
Hide and seek world champ.

4582
03:51:32,120 --> 03:51:35,320
Use hiding spot one time while being chased without getting caught.

4583
03:51:37,600 --> 03:51:39,780
Oh, use each hiding spot one time.

4584
03:51:40,020 --> 03:51:42,000
While being chased.

4585
03:51:42,220 --> 03:51:42,700
What the hell?

4586
03:51:48,140 --> 03:51:50,200
I wonder what the secret ones are.

4587
03:51:50,280 --> 03:51:50,800
The hidden ones.

4588
03:51:52,280 --> 03:51:54,380
Maybe stuff about like the minigames.

4589
03:51:54,460 --> 03:51:55,980
The other minigames and...

4590
03:52:03,900 --> 03:52:06,540
Yeah, when a chase is ongoing, it seems kind of...

4591
03:52:07,900 --> 03:52:09,600
Can't believe Mint left me to die.

4592
03:52:09,800 --> 03:52:10,240
No!

4593
03:52:12,380 --> 03:52:13,260
Poor Geoff.

4594
03:52:16,180 --> 03:52:19,740
We can... you know, we don't know if he... we don't know if he died.

4595
03:52:20,140 --> 03:52:20,580
Right?

4596
03:52:20,680 --> 03:52:21,860
Because like...

4597
03:52:23,000 --> 03:52:25,980
Springtrap was still... was still... you know...

4598
03:52:26,940 --> 03:52:28,560
He was still stuck in the ropes.

4599
03:52:28,880 --> 03:52:31,520
He could have just jumped at Geoff and Geoff went, Wow!

4600
03:52:31,920 --> 03:52:36,820
And I'm sure Geoff has really good like instincts and reflexes, you know?

4601
03:52:36,860 --> 03:52:42,280
He probably slammed the door shut really, really fast and then like bolted out of there.

4602
03:52:42,360 --> 03:52:43,400
I'm pretty sure he's good.

4603
03:52:46,220 --> 03:52:47,120
The rope broke?

4604
03:52:47,980 --> 03:52:49,280
Where is your evidence?

4605
03:53:05,120 --> 03:53:06,780
Started breaking in the cutscene.

4606
03:53:06,920 --> 03:53:07,220
No!

4607
03:53:09,140 --> 03:53:09,720
No!

4608
03:53:10,900 --> 03:53:11,480
No!

4609
03:53:13,380 --> 03:53:13,960
No!

4610
03:53:14,600 --> 03:53:15,180
No!

4611
03:53:16,040 --> 03:53:16,620
No!

4612
03:53:16,940 --> 03:53:19,560
Of these ones though, I'm still so interested about...

4613
03:53:19,560 --> 03:53:20,940
We never got one with Freddy.

4614
03:53:21,160 --> 03:53:21,540
Like...

4615
03:53:23,020 --> 03:53:25,000
I never even really had to see Freddy.

4616
03:53:25,420 --> 03:53:28,160
I should have shined my light at Freddy at one point.

4617
03:53:30,140 --> 03:53:31,300
Oh well.

4618
03:53:33,140 --> 03:53:33,720
Yay!

4619
03:53:37,220 --> 03:53:38,820
It was so fun!

4620
03:53:39,020 --> 03:53:39,880
That was really fun.

4621
03:53:41,580 --> 03:53:46,080
I liked how it introduced so many different parts.

4622
03:53:46,360 --> 03:53:48,300
And then also how...

4623
03:53:50,720 --> 03:53:51,180
Like...

4624
03:53:51,180 --> 03:53:52,440
Like the different...

4625
03:53:52,440 --> 03:53:53,220
What's the word?

4626
03:53:54,360 --> 03:53:55,580
Game mechanics, I guess?

4627
03:53:56,080 --> 03:53:57,780
And then also like the...

4628
03:53:57,780 --> 03:54:01,560
I wish there was kind of more to do with the security cameras because...

4629
03:54:01,560 --> 03:54:03,400
It kind of felt like there was no purpose.

4630
03:54:05,840 --> 03:54:08,920
I didn't really feel like there was too much of a purpose for them.

4631
03:54:10,220 --> 03:54:11,840
They were just there to be like...

4632
03:54:11,840 --> 03:54:11,960
Haha!

4633
03:54:12,280 --> 03:54:13,320
Do you get it?

4634
03:54:13,540 --> 03:54:14,380
It's FNAF!

4635
03:54:16,680 --> 03:54:17,080
But...

4636
03:54:17,080 --> 03:54:18,460
I liked it a lot.

4637
03:54:18,500 --> 03:54:19,780
Even though it was so goofy sometimes.

4638
03:54:23,940 --> 03:54:25,720
Even with the glitches, it was still nice.

4639
03:54:25,900 --> 03:54:26,240
What's that?

4640
03:54:26,320 --> 03:54:26,820
The extras.

4641
03:54:27,640 --> 03:54:28,640
Oh my god!

4642
03:54:28,820 --> 03:54:29,220
Stop!

4643
03:54:33,540 --> 03:54:35,020
Stop it right now!

4644
03:54:38,040 --> 03:54:41,180
We got all the stickers and everything too.

4645
03:54:41,360 --> 03:54:41,880
That was good.

4646
03:54:42,180 --> 03:54:43,260
The animatronics.

4647
03:54:43,260 --> 03:54:44,980
The sprites look amazing.

4648
03:54:45,640 --> 03:54:47,280
They look so, so good.

4649
03:54:48,220 --> 03:54:48,980
Look at them!

4650
03:54:50,980 --> 03:54:51,680
Question mark.

4651
03:54:51,820 --> 03:54:53,020
Why doesn't he wave either?

4652
03:54:53,980 --> 03:54:54,500
Chica...

4653
03:54:55,140 --> 03:54:55,660
Bonnie...

4654
03:54:56,780 --> 03:54:57,300
Freddy...

4655
03:54:57,300 --> 03:54:58,880
Okay, I'm gonna go to the jump scares, you guys.

4656
03:54:58,880 --> 03:55:00,440
I'm missing one inventory?

4657
03:55:00,620 --> 03:55:00,920
I am?

4658
03:55:06,520 --> 03:55:07,380
I don't see it.

4659
03:55:09,960 --> 03:55:10,840
Game over.

4660
03:55:11,900 --> 03:55:13,140
9-5 ball pit.

4661
03:55:13,360 --> 03:55:13,800
Wow!

4662
03:55:15,080 --> 03:55:16,060
Oh my gosh!

4663
03:55:16,160 --> 03:55:18,600
The animations are just so awesome!

4664
03:55:19,940 --> 03:55:22,320
Oh, I was wondering who was on the security camera.

4665
03:55:22,500 --> 03:55:23,420
So it was Springtrap.

4666
03:55:25,240 --> 03:55:26,520
I keep saying Springtrap.

4667
03:55:26,560 --> 03:55:28,220
I have no idea if it's actually him or not.

4668
03:55:29,780 --> 03:55:30,500
Alternative music.

4669
03:55:35,150 --> 03:55:36,690
Beat nightmare difficulty.

4670
03:55:38,130 --> 03:55:40,210
Arcade minigame pizza roller.

4671
03:55:40,650 --> 03:55:42,330
Arcade minigame hat game.

4672
03:55:42,910 --> 03:55:44,410
Wait, but I did hat game.

4673
03:55:47,970 --> 03:55:49,090
Music man!

4674
03:55:54,150 --> 03:56:01,750
If you're like a fan of FNAF, there's definitely probably way more things than I noticed that like you would...

4675
03:56:03,150 --> 03:56:03,990
Be like, wow!

4676
03:56:04,230 --> 03:56:05,210
This is so cool!

4677
03:56:05,530 --> 03:56:05,730
You know?

4678
03:56:05,890 --> 03:56:07,130
Jeff's Pizza Creepy.

4679
03:56:07,690 --> 03:56:08,610
Let's listen to it.

4680
03:56:20,250 --> 03:56:22,530
There's a secret with Balloon Boy's game, but I got it!

4681
03:56:22,550 --> 03:56:23,390
Oh, that's right.

4682
03:56:23,650 --> 03:56:24,770
I didn't beat it.

4683
03:56:25,510 --> 03:56:29,450
I saw the secret, but I don't think I actually didn't complete it.

4684
03:56:31,470 --> 03:56:32,570
This is so cute!

4685
03:56:36,310 --> 03:56:37,750
I can't wait for Halloween.

4686
03:56:39,190 --> 03:56:39,630
Okay.

4687
03:56:39,650 --> 03:56:39,870
Okay.

4688
03:56:39,930 --> 03:56:40,110
Okay.

4689
03:56:43,260 --> 03:56:45,080
Thank you guys for hanging out with me today.

4690
03:56:45,140 --> 03:56:47,140
I actually do have to go get ready because I do.

4691
03:56:47,220 --> 03:56:53,040
I have one to go out for a little bit and go shopping just a little bit.

4692
03:56:53,520 --> 03:56:54,940
So I'm going to go do that.

4693
03:56:55,640 --> 03:56:56,580
Thank you guys.

4694
03:56:56,720 --> 03:56:57,480
It's kind of...

4695
03:56:57,480 --> 03:56:58,620
It's pretty late now, isn't it?

4696
03:56:58,660 --> 03:57:00,220
What time is it on the East Coast?

4697
03:57:01,260 --> 03:57:03,600
It's almost 1 a.m.

4698
03:57:03,600 --> 03:57:04,720
Holy moly.

4699
03:57:08,860 --> 03:57:09,780
Cool, cool, cool.

4700
03:57:12,520 --> 03:57:13,160
I'm just...

4701
03:57:24,910 --> 03:57:25,230
Okay.

4702
03:57:26,090 --> 03:57:27,490
That's the end of the game and thanks for the stream.

4703
03:57:27,590 --> 03:57:28,090
Thank you guys!

4704
03:57:28,430 --> 03:57:29,490
Thanks for hanging out with me.

4705
03:57:29,510 --> 03:57:30,170
Sorry, I was just checking.

4706
03:57:30,270 --> 03:57:33,530
I haven't checked my phone and people are, like, messaging me.

4707
03:57:34,110 --> 03:57:35,070
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

4708
03:57:35,130 --> 03:57:35,790
Sorry, everybody.

4709
03:57:36,470 --> 03:57:36,790
Sorry.

4710
03:57:39,870 --> 03:57:40,790
I'm going to head out now.

4711
03:57:41,530 --> 03:57:44,890
And thank you guys for hanging out with me.

4712
03:57:45,670 --> 03:57:46,870
I will see you guys.

4713
03:57:47,050 --> 03:57:49,290
I don't know if I'll be able to...

4714
03:57:50,110 --> 03:57:52,330
I'm not quite sure when I'll be able to stream next.

4715
03:57:53,190 --> 03:57:54,310
As soon as I know.

4716
03:57:54,450 --> 03:57:55,890
It might be, like, two days.

4717
03:57:55,910 --> 03:57:57,030
In two days from now.

4718
03:57:57,970 --> 03:57:58,690
Japan time.

4719
03:57:58,910 --> 03:58:00,350
So maybe, like, Monday.

4720
03:58:01,370 --> 03:58:02,250
Japan time.

4721
03:58:02,310 --> 03:58:02,710
Monday.

4722
03:58:02,750 --> 03:58:03,270
Oh, wait.

4723
03:58:04,350 --> 03:58:05,210
I'll have to see.

4724
03:58:05,410 --> 03:58:06,130
Oh, gosh.

4725
03:58:06,910 --> 03:58:08,090
My schedule is a little...

4726
03:58:08,670 --> 03:58:13,090
Because of the concert and because of some other stuff I have going on.

4727
03:58:13,190 --> 03:58:14,670
Like, I'm meeting with some friends as well.

4728
03:58:15,030 --> 03:58:15,810
General Dank!

4729
03:58:15,930 --> 03:58:17,090
Welcome to membership.

4730
03:58:17,250 --> 03:58:17,670
Thank you!

4731
03:58:18,570 --> 03:58:19,010
So...

4732
03:58:23,050 --> 03:58:23,590
But...

4733
03:58:23,590 --> 03:58:24,570
And then...

4734
03:58:27,310 --> 03:58:31,430
I'll actually be moving hotels in the next couple of days as well.

4735
03:58:31,590 --> 03:58:32,090
So...

4736
03:58:32,090 --> 03:58:33,170
It's like...

4737
03:58:33,850 --> 03:58:34,390
That's...

4738
03:58:34,390 --> 03:58:34,890
I'm, like...

4739
03:58:36,170 --> 03:58:37,130
Figuring out...

4740
03:58:37,130 --> 03:58:38,710
Because I stream in the morning, right?

4741
03:58:38,770 --> 03:58:42,030
Maybe I can wake up early and stream before I move hotels.

4742
03:58:43,150 --> 03:58:43,690
Probably.

4743
03:58:45,250 --> 03:58:45,990
I think.

4744
03:58:46,710 --> 03:58:47,390
I'll see.

4745
03:58:47,490 --> 03:58:47,970
Okay.

4746
03:58:48,450 --> 03:58:48,990
Bye.

4747
03:58:49,890 --> 03:58:50,610
Okie dokie!

4748
03:58:52,970 --> 03:58:53,410
Otsumito!

4749
03:58:53,730 --> 03:58:54,690
Have fun over there, Mint.

4750
03:58:54,770 --> 03:58:55,090
Thank you!

4751
03:58:55,670 --> 03:58:58,470
Now waiting for next ASMR where you explain FNAF lore.

4752
03:58:58,610 --> 03:58:59,930
I don't know FNAF lore.

4753
03:59:00,190 --> 03:59:00,790
Saying it now.

4754
03:59:00,850 --> 03:59:01,570
Good luck with the concert!

4755
03:59:01,790 --> 03:59:02,750
I'll be cheering from home.

4756
03:59:02,890 --> 03:59:03,830
Thank you, Dogstrings!

4757
03:59:04,150 --> 03:59:04,590
Yes!

4758
03:59:04,630 --> 03:59:04,850
Oh!

4759
03:59:04,930 --> 03:59:10,970
If you are not going to Anime MYC and you still want to see Minto in concert, there are streaming tickets available as well.

4760
03:59:12,510 --> 03:59:12,950
So...

4761
03:59:13,970 --> 03:59:14,410
Yes.

4762
03:59:14,470 --> 03:59:15,390
It's on Spawn.

4763
03:59:16,490 --> 03:59:17,890
Let me post a link.

4764
03:59:18,530 --> 03:59:18,970
It's on Spawn.

4765
03:59:19,870 --> 03:59:25,530
Let me post a link in case you're just like, I want to get it!

4766
03:59:27,670 --> 03:59:28,130
Um...

4767
03:59:29,350 --> 03:59:30,410
Where is it?

4768
03:59:31,790 --> 03:59:32,250
Um...

4769
03:59:32,930 --> 03:59:33,390
Um...

4770
03:59:33,390 --> 03:59:33,570
Um...

4771
03:59:33,570 --> 03:59:33,890
Um...

4772
03:59:33,890 --> 03:59:34,050
Um...

4773
03:59:34,050 --> 03:59:34,430
Um...

4774
03:59:34,430 --> 03:59:34,650
Um...

4775
03:59:34,650 --> 03:59:34,950
Um...

4776
03:59:34,950 --> 03:59:35,010
Um...

4777
03:59:35,010 --> 03:59:35,090
Um...

4778
03:59:35,090 --> 03:59:35,790
Um...

4779
03:59:35,790 --> 03:59:35,990
Um...

4780
03:59:35,990 --> 03:59:36,230
Um...

4781
03:59:36,230 --> 03:59:36,690
Um...

4782
03:59:36,690 --> 03:59:37,010
Um...

4783
03:59:37,010 --> 03:59:37,030
Um...

4784
03:59:40,570 --> 03:59:41,010
Well...

4785
03:59:42,990 --> 03:59:44,130
Where is it and...

4786
03:59:44,130 --> 03:59:44,510
Oh, here we go.

4787
03:59:44,610 --> 03:59:44,750
Here we go!

4788
03:59:45,150 --> 03:59:45,590
Where is it?

4789
03:59:45,590 --> 03:59:45,890
Streaming ticket.

4790
03:59:49,940 --> 03:59:53,300
Come see me wiggle... at the concert!

4791
03:59:55,120 --> 03:59:55,840
Wiggle wiggle!

4792
03:59:57,520 --> 03:59:59,000
I jump and I twirl.

4793
03:59:59,040 --> 03:59:59,600
And I spin around.

4794
04:00:00,720 --> 04:00:01,980
Actually I don't know if I jump.

4795
04:00:02,200 --> 04:00:02,580
What�?

4796
04:00:02,580 --> 04:00:03,060
Well I jump.

4797
04:00:03,220 --> 04:00:03,780
Will jump?

4798
04:00:04,080 --> 04:00:04,620
Who knows?

4799
04:00:04,980 --> 04:00:06,140
Will I do cart wheels?

4800
04:00:06,280 --> 04:00:06,660
Who knows?

4801
04:00:06,660 --> 04:00:09,780
Will I wiggle and jiggle?

4802
04:00:09,880 --> 04:00:10,400
That's for sure.

4803
04:00:10,600 --> 04:00:12,040
But will I spin?

4804
04:00:12,280 --> 04:00:12,680
Probably.

4805
04:00:12,800 --> 04:00:13,780
Because I love spinning.

4806
04:00:18,000 --> 04:00:19,400
I got my streaming ticket!

4807
04:00:19,580 --> 04:00:20,500
Can't wait to see your performance!

4808
04:00:20,640 --> 04:00:20,960
Thank you!

4809
04:00:21,120 --> 04:00:21,540
Oh, hold on.

4810
04:00:21,840 --> 04:00:26,140
Streaming ticket for AMIC concert.

4811
04:00:31,520 --> 04:00:32,120
Jiggle what?

4812
04:00:32,340 --> 04:00:33,360
I gotta jiggle my body.

4813
04:00:35,200 --> 04:00:35,600
Probably.

4814
04:00:37,180 --> 04:00:38,200
I always gotta wiggle.

4815
04:00:38,920 --> 04:00:39,720
Around, you know?

4816
04:00:43,120 --> 04:00:43,920
But yeah.

4817
04:00:44,580 --> 04:00:45,800
I think it'll be a lot of fun.

4818
04:00:46,420 --> 04:00:48,540
And we've been working very hard.

4819
04:00:50,380 --> 04:00:53,240
So... I think it will be a good time!

4820
04:00:54,060 --> 04:00:54,340
Yeah!

4821
04:00:54,980 --> 04:00:55,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4822
04:00:57,160 --> 04:00:58,380
What else was I gonna say?

4823
04:01:00,080 --> 04:01:01,280
I think that's about it.

4824
04:01:04,810 --> 04:01:05,770
Don't... Okay.

4825
04:01:06,270 --> 04:01:07,950
We need like a twirl counter.

4826
04:01:10,250 --> 04:01:10,730
Because...

4827
04:01:12,430 --> 04:01:16,090
Once I get on stage, I just feel like I have to twirl.

4828
04:01:16,370 --> 04:01:16,850
So...

4829
04:01:17,750 --> 04:01:20,150
Maybe we should keep a twirl counter, you know?

4830
04:01:22,530 --> 04:01:24,730
How many times will I spin around?

4831
04:01:25,010 --> 04:01:26,810
I just feel the music, you know?

4832
04:01:26,850 --> 04:01:27,530
And I spin around.

4833
04:01:30,070 --> 04:01:31,030
The twirlies.

4834
04:01:31,270 --> 04:01:31,550
Yeah.

4835
04:01:32,790 --> 04:01:34,170
Batsu, if you go over 10?

4836
04:01:34,730 --> 04:01:34,910
Okay.

4837
04:01:35,070 --> 04:01:35,750
Oh gosh.

4838
04:01:35,930 --> 04:01:37,430
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be like...

4839
04:01:38,930 --> 04:01:39,370
Stop.

4840
04:01:39,530 --> 04:01:40,750
I'm gonna be so self-conscious.

4841
04:01:40,830 --> 04:01:41,750
I'm gonna be like... Oh my gosh.

4842
04:01:41,830 --> 04:01:42,950
Don't go over 10.

4843
04:01:43,410 --> 04:01:44,530
Don't go over 10.

4844
04:01:44,770 --> 04:01:45,710
Don't go over 10.

4845
04:01:53,030 --> 04:01:53,470
3D?

4846
04:01:53,790 --> 04:01:54,230
Maybe.

4847
04:01:57,010 --> 04:01:58,390
But, you know...

4848
04:02:02,770 --> 04:02:04,250
I don't have like a...

4849
04:02:04,950 --> 04:02:05,830
Full 3D.

4850
04:02:07,230 --> 04:02:09,590
But, you know... I'm just a special guest.

4851
04:02:09,770 --> 04:02:10,670
So I think it's okay.

4852
04:02:11,830 --> 04:02:12,270
Probably.

4853
04:02:14,070 --> 04:02:15,670
But you can still watch me...

4854
04:02:16,170 --> 04:02:16,850
You know...

4855
04:02:16,850 --> 04:02:17,590
Run around.

4856
04:02:17,850 --> 04:02:18,510
And stuff.

4857
04:02:18,970 --> 04:02:19,890
I will be running.

4858
04:02:23,490 --> 04:02:23,930
Okidoki!

4859
04:02:24,510 --> 04:02:24,950
Okay.

4860
04:02:25,050 --> 04:02:25,950
I gotta go now.

4861
04:02:26,190 --> 04:02:27,530
Because I gotta go take a shower.

4862
04:02:27,790 --> 04:02:28,870
And get ready.

4863
04:02:29,110 --> 04:02:30,490
My hair is kind of...

4864
04:02:31,670 --> 04:02:32,750
Icky right now.

4865
04:02:32,750 --> 04:02:32,850
Oh.

4866
04:02:34,170 --> 04:02:37,130
I only go to this concert offline because they got Aircraft Carrier.

4867
04:02:37,190 --> 04:02:38,490
Because they didn't set it up.

4868
04:02:39,710 --> 04:02:40,630
See you there.

4869
04:02:40,790 --> 04:02:41,310
See you there.

4870
04:02:42,110 --> 04:02:43,290
Why are you running?

4871
04:02:43,570 --> 04:02:44,690
Because I gotta go!

4872
04:02:45,010 --> 04:02:45,630
Bye bye!

4873
04:02:45,750 --> 04:02:46,910
Thanks for hanging out with me!

4874
04:02:47,130 --> 04:02:47,750
Thanks for...

4875
04:02:47,750 --> 04:02:49,030
I'm glad we could finish the game.

4876
04:02:49,170 --> 04:02:50,450
And I will see you guys...

4877
04:02:50,910 --> 04:02:52,070
Like I said...

4878
04:02:53,810 --> 04:02:56,170
When I am able to stream next.

4879
04:02:56,910 --> 04:03:01,350
I will put up a waiting room as soon in advance as I am able to.

4880
04:03:02,370 --> 04:03:02,650
Yeah.

4881
04:03:03,210 --> 04:03:03,830
Otsuminto everyone!

4882
04:03:04,010 --> 04:03:04,790

4885

4886

4887

Have a good day!
