1
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,110
Hello everybody.

2
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,550
Hello, hello, hello.

3
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,520
My, my, my, my.

4
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,020
Yeah.

5
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,020
Welcome in.

6
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,960
Welcome in.

7
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,400
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

8
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,680
Welcome to Leaf It Allowed.

9
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,560
I guess this is a leaf power wash simulator, which I'm
totally for.

10
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,760
I kind of wanted, I honestly, I had this as like a, what's
it called?

11
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,480
A throwaway game, I'll call it for travel, right?

12
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,180
Like if I needed something to stream that wasn't super
intensive while I was traveling.

13
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,660
I had this on the back burner, but also I was like, I
haven't, there's a couple of long streams.

14
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:05,640
this week so but in the end it ended up being too low energy
streams.

15
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,900
I did hightail too.

16
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,020
Hello me, Tao, and I boo's like you!

17
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,820
How you make sure you keep that lawn clean.

18
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,100
The HOAs have been bugging me about it.

19
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,940
No, no HOAs in this vicinity.

20
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,540
Facility.

21
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:20,980
Neighborhood.

22
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,760
Yeah, Doki collab was so long.

23
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:34,520
But I guess that maybe was the only long one i did this week
whatever it doesn't matter who cares i just i wanted to

24
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:41,860
chill before the chaos of densetsu collab later which there
will be a collab later me and densetsu dot exe on the

25
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:51,120
densetsu youtube channel we'll be writing into it so um but
if you're a vod watcher then go check it out because it will

26
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,400
be fun make like a tree and get out of here mcfly

27
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,260
Is that what he says?

28
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,420
What if I'm not a VOD watcher?

29
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,900
Then you should go right after this stream.

30
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,960
Actually, I probably won't stream up to the collab.

31
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,220
That's what he says.

32
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,640
What is it supposed to be?

33
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,880
Make like a tree and...

34
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,840
Shake it.

35
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,520
Make like a tree and sprout.

36
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,340
Make like a tree and stand there.

37
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,880
Oh, leaf!

38
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,860
But trees have leaves.

39
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,620
Vivi Cortex with a vibe gift!

40
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,880
Make like a tree and...

41
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,940
Photosynthesize.

42
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,000
But they make the leaves.

43
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,800
So they do leaf.

44
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:22,660
leaf verb okay guys I'm leafing I'm leaf I'm doing leaf
they're they're coming out of my fingers I'm doing leaf is

45
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:36,800
it I am leaf I am leaf I'm leafing it about as funny as a
screen door on a battleship what my Joker but Free talk's

46
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,160
funny?

47
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,600
Anyway, we're gonna start a new game.

48
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,540
This is this seems to be a pretty zatsu.

49
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,420
My head hurts so much.

50
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,320
Pretty free talk heavy stream.

51
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,500
I fell into a coma yet another time and doctors still can't
figure out why.

52
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,500
And how come there are so many leaves in here again?

53
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,280
Wait, why am I?

54
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,740
Will I ever manage to clean up this cursed yard?

55
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,100
I'm also not pressing continue.

56
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,500
It's just doing it on its own.

57
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,440
What?

58
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,300
Why have I had another cup?

59
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,900
I'm afraid it's been nine years.

60
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,080
Imagine the leaf buildup in nine years.

61
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,720
Branch and owl.

62
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,140
To seal or not to seal.

63
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,480
Pick up the leaves and dump them one by one or unlock the
bag tying ability.

64
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:44,060
I'm this actually makes so much sense we don't know how to
tie bags because we've been in a coma we've literally lost

65
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:54,860
all our motor skills by cleaning up the entire porch and
throw it away all at once hold and run I did okay so before

66
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:04,500
literally the stream um I watched the trailer for this game
I hadn't watched it before I just thought that it was like a

67
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:13,940
leaf cleaning simulator but there was something kind of
mysterious they were implying so i'm very curious it's my

68
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:20,900
birthday today and one year anniversary of my first super
chat hope you and i must have a great day looking forward to

69
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:33,820
the stream and the dance and took with the daily dial thank
you happy birthday happy birthday to you happy birthday to

70
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:49,820
you happy birthday to you daily day oh happy birthday to you
oh happy birthday thank you so much for the gift nine year

71
00:09:49,820 --> 00:10:01,340
coma that's unbelievable but yeah let the inlets do the
heavy leaf thing they suck up nearby leaves and convert them

72
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:11,860
into check leaves the in-game currency oh Use a rake or leaf
blower to herd leaves into an inlet's range.

73
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,260
Then watch your pockets grow.

74
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,280
Fluid picker?

75
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,500
I have zero sense.

76
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,700
Meant to cleaning my yard on my birthday.

77
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,120
And that guy's birthday!

78
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,420
Detective!

79
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,990
Wait, is it Detective Koo?

80
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:30,750
Happy birthday!

81
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,810

82

87
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,920
Sprint ability.

88
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,820
What is that noise?

89
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,260
Oh!

90
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,480
I have to get you...

91
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:25,680
Wait.

92
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,800
I'm like clicking.

93
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,100
Oh!

94
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,540
Repair.

95
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,160
Is it saying that I can't do it, maybe?

96
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,300
Halo, thank you!

97
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,360
Thank you, thank you.

98
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,520
Oh!

99
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,460
Wait, so how do I make any money at all, then?

100
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,460
in the beginning is what I'm curious about.

101
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,500
Milky Way in.

102
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,310
Very slowly.

103
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,390
Oh, I got very little.

104
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,470
Oh, buddies.

105
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,130
Okay.

106
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,810
All right, we gotta pick up something.

107
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,190
What if I had, like, an auto-clicker?

108
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,170
What if I use an auto-clicker, right?

109
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:36,270
oh oh i hold it down there we go okay so i can hold up the
50 at a time right now we just gotta make some cash money

110
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:44,550
any any sorts mint has no sense but i can't help but
remember the one part of over the garden wall i have no

111
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:56,490
sense no sense at all i think of it too oh my gosh i have
like a 1.9 leaf per second right right now we need to get

112
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:06,230
higher almost two leaves per second i think some of the
upgrades are like an auto clicker this is kind of great

113
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:15,450
though i think i can really get behind this wait is there
more back here oh i have to unlock i can see it i can see it

114
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:28,550
i saw some uh the reviews this game said that it's not a you
can like 100 the game in not a long time so yeah i gotta up

115
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:39,250
my my stats though 1.9 leaf per second is crazy okay you
can't hold down the click you have to keep continuously

116
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:48,790
clicking the door is a paywall i can't even run i have to
pay for that It's kind of wild.

117
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,390
It's kind of cozy though.

118
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,390
How's the weather where you guys are?

119
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:01,670
Is it very cold if you are in the United States of America?

120
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,490
It's cold.

121
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,490
All right, so I have, oh, I had 69 cents, nice.

122
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,650
We can upgrade.

123
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,890
Dexterity reduces the intervals between picking up leaves.

124
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,890
Greedy grasp.

125
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,870
Why click the 100 times when you can just hold the...

126
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,550
Hey.

127
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,050
Nice.

128
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,410
Okay, we got some upgrades already.

129
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,050
Oh, my God.

130
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,970
Invest, invest, invest.

131
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,030
I'm not even having to click anymore.

132
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:51,910
This is great.

133
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,830
Paying for quality of life.

134
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,010
I can see the floor.

135
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,010
Extremely cold today.

136
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,150
Yeah.

137
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,690
Oh.

138
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,070
Something just popped up.

139
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,090
Oh, I think I can get another upgrade.

140
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,610
6.9 leaves per second.

141
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,950
This is not just a cleaning game.

142
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:34,190
This is like getting this guy's motor skills backup type of
game like we're learning how to be human again actually it

143
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:40,150
was the hospital that dumped all these leaves here to try
and this is my physical therapy

144
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:55,650
maybe rehab leaf trainer they're gonna give me back problems
and so i'm having to i'm gonna i'm having to like lean over

145
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:01,010
so They will, I go from one problem to the next.

146
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,830
I can't, I click control.

147
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,750
It doesn't, it like yells at me.

148
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,250
Reduces the intervals.

149
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:09,930
Let's try that.

150
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,430
Oh yeah.

151
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,390
Eight leaves per second.

152
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,930
That's how they get you.

153
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,770
Leveling up like a true RPG.

154
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,890
A true physical therapy recovery adventure.

155
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,710
Okay.

156
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,970
I could almost...

157
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,450
I feel like that could be like a game concept.

158
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,110
Like...

159
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,850
Like someone who...

160
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,750
Like has to remember how to...

161
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,050
Not remember, but like it's like I've been in a coma.

162
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,310
I have to learn how to see.

163
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,410
My body does not remember how to see.

164
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,390
My eyes have been closed for too long.

165
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,790
I must unlock the ability.

166
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,270
It's in spawn.

167
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,790
It's not sad.

168
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,470
Breaking leaves is actually bad for fireflies.

169
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,610
Why now?

170
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,720
I would need to...

171
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,340
I wish I could increase my capacity.

172
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,780
Wait, I think we can get...

173
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,420
How much are these?

174
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,840
75 cents.

175
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,700
An average bag for average leaf enjoyers.

176
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,720
200 leaves!

177
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,700
So if I buy it...

178
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,720
Oh!

179
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,480
Now I have 200.

180
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,260
Capacity.

181
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,240
We'll do leaves that are like really far away, right?

182
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,680
Also bad for grass since it doesn't insulate ground from
cold and snow.

183
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,380
That's so sad.

184
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,520
Wait, so we're damaging the environment.

185
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,400
Leaves are natural.

186
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,480
Don't leaf it alone.

187
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,500
Wait, I had no idea about that.

188
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,660
I figured that like, I thought it would be bad because it's
like...

189
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,500
You're denying...

190
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,840
You're denying the leaves of their, um, like, uh, what's the
word?

191
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:09,960
Can I jump?

192
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,520
Oh, I have to unlock this, okay.

193
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:19,240
Denying them the, uh, like, the leaves to decompose, and so
you get the nutrients, right?

194
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,140
That's what I thought.

195
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,320
But it's also just fun to make a big old pile and jump in
it.

196
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,720
Wait, so this is, like, harming the environment.

197
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:41,820
simulator go back in your coma I'm just kidding what do you
think you're doing they woke up and chose violence against

198
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,160
the earth I

199
00:18:51,040 --> 00:19:00,800
wonder if we eventually start getting paid more per leaf
could be huge I think to fix this it's three bucks oh it's

200
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:10,320
free this one was three dollars

201
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,800
It's sucking it up.

202
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,070
Free bucks.

203
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,610
My leaves are becoming more valuable because they're a
scarcity.

204
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,970
Someone's trying to buy leaves, but other people are picking
them all up.

205
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,330
Other people, aka me.

206
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,830
And there might be like some fall festival and they're like,
we need thousands of leaves!

207
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,670
Thousands for the children to jump into the piles.

208
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,530
Pass me some good luck.

209
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,070
I'm being stuck at work cleaning up during after the
blizzard.

210
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,690
Probably the next week?

211
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:01,330
No!

212
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,790
But...

213
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,810
Good luck.

214
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,090
Free bucks.

215
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,990
What do you clean up after a blizzard?

216
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,270
Are you shoveling snow?

217
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:17,950
Snow, snow.

218
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,590
We need more snow.

219
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:21,650
Indeed.

220
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,190
Actually, I think we don't need any more snow.

221
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,120
I can't stop coding that recently.

222
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,980
Oh my gosh, there's even leaves in here.

223
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,540
Oh, sneaky.

224
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,120
No, no, no.

225
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,600
Not on my watch.

226
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,360
Yeah.

227
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,090
No more snow ever, please.

228
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,410
I think I'm done with...

229
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,310
I'm quite finished with...

230
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,290
With...

231
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,770
winter.

232
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,310
I'm ready for another season.

233
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,790
I think it's come to that point.

234
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,730
Even though I feel like we still have many more season, not
many more, but we have a couple more months of the season.

235
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,950
All in favor of changing the weather?

236
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,930
The freeze is coming.

237
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,250
No, I'll have.

238
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,530
No freeze.

239
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,030
The freeze is here.

240
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,870
The freeze is here.

241
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,250
I just hope I don't lose power.

242
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:37,190
I found out about jumping in a pile of leaves if you're
wearing earbuds take them out otherwise you'll be searching

243
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:48,650
for teeny tiny earbuds in a big leaf pile literal needle in
a haystack can it just stay autumn I know autumn is really

244
00:21:48,650 --> 00:22:01,690
truly the ideal season but as an idle fan I must say winter,
not winter, sorry, summer is great.

245
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,850
And I say that, okay, but ice skating is fun.

246
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,510
I thought about going ice skating this year.

247
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,790
Or last year, I guess.

248
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,550
This season.

249
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,230
The winter.

250
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,390
I thought about it.

251
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,430
But I never, I didn't actually get around to it.

252
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,910
I do like ice skating, though.

253
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,990
But, I don't know, I'll just go to a roller rink.

254
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,630
It's not the same, but I'll, you know.

255
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:23,770
Contradiction.

256
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:24,810
Spot the layer.

257
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:33,390
It's a point and detective game with real people maybe as a
co-lab a co-lab oh like uh wait that sounds fine thank you

258
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:48,470
shark uh so because i used to do like inline skating um i
really you know i enjoy going to like a roller rink and

259
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:55,810
stuff i'll have fun with that contradiction is great oh we
could do a next Weak?

260
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:57,450
Maybe.

261
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,670
Oh, liar.

262
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,530
Wait, spot, oh, it's a liar.

263
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,070
Wait, let me write it down.

264
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,670
Contradiction, spot the layer.

265
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,490
Wait, I think we can buy a rake soon.

266
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,790
I think it was $7.

267
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:38,610
749 $50 for the leaf I mean that makes sense but it still
makes me sad Large leaf bag 500 leaves Wait I think I should

268
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:50,910
buy this first No We'll buy the rake and make big money And
then we will Oh I collected a bonk It's cute Wait there's

269
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,950

270
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:03,260
We'll buy the rake first and then we'll start making big fat
big big stacks big fat stacks really fast

271
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:21,380
i'm like sticking by the what's it called we're branching
out from we're branch make like a tree and branch out from

272
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,730

Okay.

276
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:42,970
Uh.

277
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,490
Uh.

278
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,530
Oh.

279
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,030
Oh.

280
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:47,750
Okay, here we go.

281
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,330
Yes!

282
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:53,670
Yes!

283
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:55,810
No.

284
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:56,570
Go back.

285
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:56,950
Go in.

286
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,270
Come on.

287
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:58,970
Come on.

288
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,110
Come on.

289
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,710
Does it have like a cooldown?

290
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:05,730
What is this?

291
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,190
Oh, I have to look down, that's why.

292
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,660
Yes, yes, yes, everybody gets sucked.

293
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,480
I think Denzatsu.exe should also have a yearly summer song
and video.

294
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,200
Well.

295
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:39,150
I think my next song, though, will be a summer song.

296
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,010
Which I'm very excited about.

297
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,850
Yeah, as an idol fan, summer is great.

298
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,630
It's not perfect, but this is definitely a system.

299
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,910
You like idols?

300
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,790
I love idols.

301
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,330
It's working so far.

302
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,290
Yeah, it is.

303
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,370
Oh, come on.

304
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,130
Come on.

305
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:24,750
There we go.

306
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,030
All right, let's start making...

307
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,830
What if I make a big pile?

308
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,830
How is, I wonder what the biggest pile I could make it.

309
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,140
Ooh, it's getting red.

310
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,720
I'm gonna jump in it.

311
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,100
There was a Shrek game where Donkey had a line like, now
let's make it, make like a tree and get in our onion

312
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,600
carriage.

313
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,300
Oh, Donkey.

314
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,080
Oh, Donkey.

315
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,980
That guy's so silly.

316
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,860
Why is it so flat?

317
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,160
Don't talk about my Oshi like that.

318
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,780
Minto's really raking in the cash.

319
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:20,840
Oh, yeah.

320
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,520
Denzetsu Beach episode.

321
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,580
That would be so fun.

322
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,810
Minto looking in the mirror.

323
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,050
I think I'm normal.

324
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,390
I think I'm average.

325
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,250
Not too big.

326
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,690
Never too small.

327
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,040
Why is it so flat though?

328
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,440
It's supposed to be a pile of leaves.

329
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,300
Getting closer to that two-year mark.

330
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,500
Oh yeah!

331
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,300
We're gonna start seeing people in the upcoming months
turning rainbow.

332
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,740
I think that's a two-year one.

333
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Rainbow.

334
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,180
years two years

335
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:42,900
it's my birthday tomorrow gonna get that early birthday
speedy fire happy birthday but it's your birthday tomorrow

336
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:53,240
are you gonna be doing stuff are you gonna be out and about
in the town having a fun time senchi thank you so much for

337
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,040
the 10 gifts Do you guys know the Denshi name?

338
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,780
That is for, like, fans of Densetsu.exe?

339
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,180
I came up with that.

340
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,120
It was a stroke of genius.

341
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,720
So you know how we're, like, protectors of Akiba and all.

342
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:20,880
It's inspired by the name Senshi, like, Warrior, like, you
know, Sailor Senshi.

343
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:37,740
part is like the electric so it's it's kind of like it's
like a multiple meaning right so den she the the word also

344
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:51,680
means like electron in japanese like you know and then but
so it's pronounced like that but it uses the kanji for like

345
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:58,220
so it's like essentially electric warrior You guys are also
warriors.

346
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,680
With us.

347
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,260
Like Den-Shi.

348
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

349
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,560
I love Japanese wordplay.

350
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Yeah, it was my stroke of genius.

351
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,500
I was like, what do you guys think?

352
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,400
Because we are Den-Satsu.

353
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,680
Dot EXE.

354
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,980
You are Den-Shi.

355
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,960
No, well, thank you so much for that one.

356
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,480
Thank you.

357
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,350
Clever.

358
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,310
Thank you.

359
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,310
So we are common riders.

360
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,650
I wonder if you guys, if Denchi should have a mascot,
though.

361
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,450
It'd be kind of cute.

362
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:56,330
Yeah, like has multiple meanings, so I thought it was kind
of fun to...

363
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:12,470
to use it but if you know it does require a bit of
explanation what the hell Steiner get out of here why is the

Raking in the cash.

00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,290

Whoa, what's this?

375
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,590
Is this another collectible?

376
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:29,850
Eww.

377
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,370
We need more upgrades.

378
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,990
I forgot about these.

379
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:38,410
Journal.

380
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:39,710
Wait!

381
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,690
Jump into a big leaf pile!

382
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:42,490
Wait!

383
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,410
Find a way into the garage.

384
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,970
Don't hurry unless you can.

385
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,470
Go shed shopping.

386
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,650
I need it too!

387
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,290
Jump into...

388
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:51,610
Wait!

389
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:52,450
So there...

390
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,330
Oh, whoops, sorry, my bad.

391
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,110
There we go.

392
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,770
So I do need to...

393
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,750
Okay, maybe in another area we can do it.

394
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:04,350
Because I don't...

395
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,670
I mean, there surely is a thousand leaves here, but...

396
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,390
I tried!

397
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,210
I tried.

398
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,770
I said my biggest pile is...

399
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,430
14.

400
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,470
What do you mean by that?

401
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,630
This is way more than 14!

402
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,630
Hello, game?

403
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,490
Maybe it needs to be a tighter pile.

404
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:44,720
while okay hold on let's we'll try the other side we'll try
the other side the other side surely has over a thousand can

405
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,440
i even oh i can jump

406
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:59,370
oh number go up number go up thank you so much for the thank
you i

407
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:12,960
wonder if we can get rake upgrades because like a huge wide
break.

408
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,080
Make her wide.

409
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,220
Make her wide.

410
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,350
You can.

411
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,430
Oh, okay, I can.

412
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,800
Find a way into the garage.

413
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,660
It says don't...

414
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,160
Oh!

415
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,120
My moving speed went up.

416
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:32,680
Nice.

417
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,620
Oh, front yard is 100%.

418
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,280
But, oh, I see, I see.

419
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,900
This is the entrance.

420
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,400
That's why it's different.

421
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,240
Oh, interesting.

422
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,600
Find a way into the garage.

423
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,240
Can I climb?

424
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Can I crouch?

425
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:47,900
No.

426
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,920
There is another vent here.

427
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,940
It needs to be repaired.

428
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,880
We'll make the pile right in front of it.

429
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,840
Okay, watch this, guys.

430
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,380
We'll make a giant pile right in front of it while it's not
repaired yet.

431
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,280
And we'll jump in it.

432
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,320
And then...

433
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,960
We'll fix it.

434
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,540
She's cooking.

435
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,020
Someone cooked here.

436
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,460
you guys i haven't been drawing so much it's maybe making me
a little sad and i was thinking about it i was like you know

437
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:36,620
right now i have a lot kind of that i've been working on so
i haven't really had time to draw but when i was watching

438
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:46,140

444
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,660
I have to catch up on common rather.

445
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:45,450
I would say after my jazz show, but even not, I don't think
so.

446
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,310
It's even gonna get busier after that probably.

447
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:57,030
Still normal streams, just busy on the back end.

448
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,160
If you know, you know.

449
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,540
Actually, none of you should know.

450
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,610
Why is it not going up?

451
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,770
What am I doing wrong?

452
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,570
My birthday is Monday.

453
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,730
Should I get choco cake?

454
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:18,590
Yeah!

455
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,510
Wait!

456
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:20,770
Who said that?

457
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,130
Oh my gosh, shiver!

458
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,850
Happy early birthday!

459
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,970
Sorry I won't be streaming then.

460
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,490
Ask tomorrow for a birthday.

461
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,710
I'll do a little dance.

462
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,590
I'll be in 3D.

463
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,270
If you don't know, you don't Oh no.

464
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:47,950
Speaking of Toku, have you heard about the upcoming Gavin
Infinity?

465
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:48,870
I haven't.

466
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,450
If you liked Foundation, then I would recommend Altered
Carbon.

467
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,210
What's Foundation?

468
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,370
Look at my pile is great!

469
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,530
Maybe I need to make a different pile.

470
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,250
Let's fix this real quick.

471
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,870
Oh wow, that was so anti-climactic.

472
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,450
Taking place of Super Sentai.

473
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:20,230
Ooh!

474
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:21,270
What?

475
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,390
Rake upgrades.

476
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,610
Wait, is that under here?

477
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,610
No stinking way.

478
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,250
Leaf stickiness.

479
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,030
Improves how leaves follow the rake.

480
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,810
Sweep radius.

481
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,030
Makes the rake affect more leaves at once.

482
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,010
Wait, we'll do both.

483
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,320
well i need to make a new pile i think

484
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:27,040
i think the other pile was too small or rather not too small
i think they were like you've jumped in this pile too many

485
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:35,700
times maybe i need to make it like huge and then jump in it
once get more viewers in a stream than days in a year it's

486
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:40,180
always someone's birthday yeah i guess I guess that would be
true, huh?

487
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,820
Do I have more viewers than number of days in a year?

488
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,640
How many days in a year are there?

489
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:48,780
365!

490
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,160
I do?

491
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,940
Yippee!

492
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,760
It was my birthday two weeks ago.

493
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,940
Tier 9!

494
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,060
Why didn't you tell me?

495
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,250
At least 14 viewers.

496
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:16,490
No, no.

497
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,390
You must be of age to watch.

498
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,390
If you are 14, get out of here.

499
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:32,030
I'm not raunchy or anything, but I ain't for kids.

500
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,390
There are 65 viewers in the world.

501
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,070
I'm old Minky.

502
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:45,990
Okay, what?

503
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,470
You want a trophy for it or what?

504
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,510
Here we go.

505
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,740
What the?

506
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,040
What do you mean?

507
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,760
Okay, no.

508
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,180
This is BS.

509
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,680
This is BS.

510
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,740
Forced you!

511
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,930
Get serious, but...

512
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,450
Okay, I'm getting serious.

513
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,690
I'm trying.

514
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,770
I wonder if like in these leaves is a key to get...

515
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,650
Well, the garage doesn't seem to be needing a key.

516
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,610
That was actually Nimi that said she watched Foundation.

517
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,010
Foundation and Altered Carbon are both good shows if
you're...

518
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:46,270
Oh!

519
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,850
Oh, that's so funny.

520
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,050
You're all good.

521
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,740
We turned on this one.

522
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,060
This is why I have no grass.

523
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,900
Because I'm just...

524
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,240
I'm raking up all the leaves.

525
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,980
They can't live.

526
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,480

530
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,500
I only watched the first episode.

531
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,480
I don't know.

532
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,540
Maybe I'll watch the second episode after

533
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,680

534
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,400
Viewer discretion is advised.

535
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,480

audience well I don't use a strong language usually because

551
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,300
My TV might have a crush on you because when I open the
YouTube app it plays one of your past dreams in full screen

552
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,900
before getting to the menu.

553
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,160
Regardless of how long the TV has been turned off or what I
last watched on YouTube.

554
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,740

Bigger.

558
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,720

00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,220
Oh!

567
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,580
It's true.

568
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,280
Who knows?

569
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,800
Maybe you like getting the life sucked out of you.

570
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,100
Maybe it's a little bit of an addicting feeling.

571
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,760
I don't know what it feels like.

572
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,780
It might tickle.

573
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,660
Or hurt.

574
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,360
Like how it hurts.

575
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,300
Well, I mean, it's gonna hurt a little bit.

576
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,080
It's your life being drained.

577
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,760
I joined Strayed during a strange sentence.

578
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,000
I feel like that's quite normal, no?

579
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,080
I mean, I'm a ghost.

580
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,980
Instead of parasocial, I want to play the stranding with
them.

581
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,220
Oh, no, play DS with them.

582
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,720
Hey, can I buy your modded...

583
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,120
For captured DS.

584
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,220
Oh, wait, what do you mean?

585
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,180
It has an effect that makes me parasocial.

586
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,040
Paranormal.

587
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,480
Ain't that getting freaky?

588
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,140
More likely than you think.

589
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,100
I'm sorry.

590
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,420
I can't stop my freak.

591
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,880
I won't apologize for my freak.

592
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,280
I'm a freak and I'm proud.

593
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,480
You guys are all freaks, too.

594
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,300
You're here, after all.

595
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,660
She's super freaker.

596
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,300
I'm...

597
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,640
Life is more fun if you're freaky.

598
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,480
I, well, I assume.

599
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,800
Afterlife is more fun if you're freaky.

600
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,380
Assume it works the same.

601
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:14,470
I think that was freaky, but equally sweet and wholesome.

602
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:16,470
No, I'm evil.

603
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,670
I'm evil.

604
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,420
Hey, hey, where are you going?

605
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,520
Into the...

606
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,020
Yippee!

607
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,280
Gotta go fast!

608
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,260
I can sprint!

609
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:37,720
now.

610
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,160
Oh my god, it's huge.

611
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:41,580
Huge.

612
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,320
We could sprint.

613
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,280
We leaf, we rake, we piles.

614
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:49,880
Music.

615
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,360
What the hell?

616
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,680
Sprinto minto.

617
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,380
There's gotta be a key in here.

618
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,540
Or something, right?

619
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,900
Find a way into the garage.

620
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,300
I'm remembering bodily.

621
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,120
remembering my bodily functions.

622
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,780
Like, run.

623
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,920
Is that a function, or?

624
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,480
I will just pick this up by hand.

625
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,020
No elp.

626
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,940
Yeah, no elp, no elp, no elp.

627
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,120
These are cheap.

628
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,860
Maybe it's hidden under, like, a...

629
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,380
Well, I keep thinking it's gotta be a key.

630
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,680
I'm not quite sure, actually.

631
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,920
It is a function, yeah?

632
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:49,760
Okay, see?

633
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,210
Legs.

634
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,340
Legs.

635
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,460
I'm glad that I can sometimes have legs.

636
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,140
Legs are sexy.

637
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:10,290
I get it.

638
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,470
I get it.

639
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:12,570
I understand it, Granon.

640
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,520
They really are.

641
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,400
Yeah.

642
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:29,080
Granon has some good taste.

643
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:29,860
He does.

644
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:30,540
I know.

645
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,660
We can sprint.

646
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,980
So 50 leaves gives us two bucks.

647
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,040
Actually, I'm going to rake these.

648
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:40,640
Watch this.

649
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,440
We'll rake them into a big pile and it'll be easier to grab.

650
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,900
Do you have legs now?

651
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,920
I've always had legs.

652
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,820
Well, not always.

653
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,000
But I have legs.

654
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,640
That, you know.

655
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:03,280
If I, if I'm, if I, you know, if I have enough energy.

656
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,760
spiritual energy.

657
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,640
Prove it!

658
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,300
You don't believe me?

659
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,100
Why would I lie about having legs?

660
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,680
Um, yeah, I have legs.

661
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:16,400
Jesse!

662
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,900
Thank you so much for the podcast.

663
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:18,880
Thank you!

664
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,820
I bet she doesn't even have legs.

665
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,540
I only watch VTubers with legs.

666
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:30,860
Legs.

667
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,600
And furthermore, legs.

668
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,260
legs.

669
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,340
Wait, is this exactly?

670
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,000
Imagine if it were like so...

671
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,620
Whoa!

672
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,980
Bag tying ability.

673
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:43,720
What's that?

674
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,140
Our yard is becoming so clean.

675
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,880
How do I get in?

676
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,620
Do I climb?

677
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,730
Do you think I can get it in the goal?

678
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,120
In the hoop?

679
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,800
It's a goal.

680
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,900
That's my goal, is to get it in the hoop.

681
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,280
Is there anything else?

682
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,280
Open.

683
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,120
Wait, is it closing?

684
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,880
Oh, it closes very slowly.

685
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,400
Run!

686
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:51,920
Run!

687
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,200
Oh!

688
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,860
Look at that!

689
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,240
Grab.

690
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,000
Throw!

691
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,360
Hold on, hold on.

692
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,120
I got this.

693
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:26,020

697
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,370
Crouch, we need to crouch.

698
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,750
I think this is another collectible.

699
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:59,350
Yeah, we got another one.

700
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:01,510
Leafy.

701
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:03,610
Eternity time.

702
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,650
Polish cow is missing.

703
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:08,930
Only UFO magazine.

704
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:10,410
Is UFO real thing?

705
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,720
Why do they have so many license plates?

706
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,260
Okay, so I need to start making, I need to, wait, I need to
start then upgrading my hands.

707
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:35,420
because it seems like we need to tie bags if we rake we're
not tying bags

708
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:43,090
like if we well rather if we rake into into the vents right

709
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:57,210
first we rake then we bag you know what yeah let's rake into
a big old pile like i did before we need to upgrade my hands

710
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,890
I said what I said.

711
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,350
Mint got hands.

712
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,370
Catching these hands.

713
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:07,670
Catch...

714
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,170
Look at my hand.

715
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:11,670
That's a hand.

716
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:12,910
Wait, I can even...

717
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,930
I can even show you that whole thing.

718
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,690
That's a hand.

719
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:19,330
Straight for gripping.

720
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:21,950
Yeah, that's a hand.

721
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:23,650
That's a hand.

722
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,550
We got hands up the wazoo.

723
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:27,910
We got so many hands.

724
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,610
Double hands!

725
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:30,830
No hands!

726
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:32,310
Double hands!

727
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,430
No hands!

728
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:35,290
Double hands!

729
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:35,290
No hands!

730
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,350
Double hands!

731
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:43,790
I got hands!

732
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,220
Noodle fingers.

733
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,040
Okay, okay.

734
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,620
I mean, what do you expect?

735
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,840
I'm literally... I'm basically jelly.

736
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,800
Why are the hands up there?

737
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,700
Nice hands, boss.

738
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:06,560
Make sure to wear gloves.

739
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,400
Oh, yeah, I'm cold.

740
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,340
That's why I have my jacket on.

741
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,270
You guys made me take it off.

742
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,980
How can we be so sure if you don't hold it?

743
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,500
Okay, okay, here we go, here we go.

744
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:32,320
Alright, one of the things was dump a leaf bag from an
impressive distance.

745
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,860
Tie bags full of leaves.

746
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,360
with everything you can.

747
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,880
Oh, I have to tie it.

748
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,100
Okay, there we go.

749
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,580
Now grab it and throw!

750
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:10,850
Okay, hold on.

751
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:19,950
Okay, we're just gonna do it like we did before.

752
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,140
Throw.

753
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,780
She's too good.

754
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,460
Watch this.

755
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:48,650
Was that impressive?

756
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:51,970
Five meters.

757
00:57:54,930 --> 00:58:00,290
Wait, also it says the entrance is 95.2% complete.

758
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,410
Where am I missing?

759
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,540
Front yard is 100.

760
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,360
Oh, these.

761
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:21,980
Probably.

762
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,100
Oh, I guess that...

763
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:28,900
Oh, okay, just kidding.

764
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,000
It's the driveway, so, okay.

765
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,760
Minto is balling.

766
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:34,700
She's pretty good.

767
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,500
I got the flowers.

768
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,120
I guess it just...

769
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,100
It's counting the driveway.

770
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:44,900
Oh.

771
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:47,720
Alright.

772
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,040
She's really good.

773
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,220
This is actually, like, super satisfying.

774
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,600
Of a cape.

775
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,060
Wait, can I upgrade my hands?

776
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,270
We gotta also...

777
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:20,750
We also have to hit it with, um...

778
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:23,530
How, though?

779
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,630
They kick like a crazy amount...

780
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:26,070
Force?

781
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,610
How would I even get it up there?

782
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:31,490
Huh!

783
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:33,030
You know?

784
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:34,590
How?

785
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:36,830
Hit the basket.

786
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,500
I think you raked some of the elite front leaves over to the
driveway.

787
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:51,540
Oh, okay.

788
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,900
So it just still counts them, maybe.

789
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,200
I got what you mean.

790
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,020
Okay, okay, okay.

791
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,540
Oh, well, I'll get picked up anyway, so it doesn't matter.

792
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,020
It don't even matter.

793
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,940
All right, all right.

794
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,300
Now let's see if I do this.

795
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,420
if I do it from here again

796
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:36,300
does that count oh wait okay now it's seven meters now if I
go back a little bit well actually I want to try from here I

797
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,160
want to see if it adds it you know

798
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:46,530
no okay we have to do really far away what is this even
possible

799
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,590
from the best skip ball hoop.

800
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:56,210
Because it made my migraine go away.

801
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:59,330
Now I can stop watching in Cyclops mode with an eye patch.

802
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:00,130
No!

803
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:01,990
We're a St. Glitch face.

804
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:05,990
I'm glad you're your migraine's going away.

805
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:06,730
Sorry for pausing.

806
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:07,270
Um.

807
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:08,870
Jump too?

808
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:11,970
Oh dang.

809
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:12,870
Okay, okay, okay.

810
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:20,840
Huh!

811
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,840
I think I need to look up higher.

812
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:24,760
I don't know.

813
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:26,380
Oh!

814
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,240
Do I need to upgrade my hands?

815
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,420
Huh!

816
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:35,310
I don't know.

817
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,930
Also, let's upgrade my hands.

818
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,050
We're max, baby.

819
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,480
Sprint and throw, maybe.

820
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,580
Oh, yeah.

821
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:53,800
We'll sprint.

822
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,580
We'll do all three.

823
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:55,920
We'll sprint.

824
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:04,160
Okay, okay, okay.

825
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:05,920
Dang it.

826
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,320
The garbage can said, nope.

827
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:10,760
Yoink.

828
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:13,120
No, please.

829
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:20,750
So close.

830
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:28,610
Oh, okay.

831
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:29,830
That's what I was like, what the heck?

832
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:31,150
All right, hold on.

833
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,440
That should have been it.

834
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,400
That should have been it.

835
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,580
That should have been it.

836
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,380
I think I am, like, I'm not aiming it correctly.

837
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:03,260
Trying to get the speedrun achievement and this game broke
me.

838
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,000
There's a speedrun?

839
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:06,640
Wait, there's...

840
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,220
Oh, no.

841
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,040
A speedrun achievement.

842
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:10,060
Oh, geez.

843
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:13,400
Yeah!

844
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,180
We did it, baby!

845
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:18,540
Nice.

846
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,120
Hit the basket with everything you can.

847
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,160
That, I wonder how.

848
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:28,520
Also, how did the leaves get inside the garage?

849
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,160
Like, to this capacity, it's kind of crazy.

850
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,800
Minto gaming.

851
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,500
Gotta get your head in the game.

852
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,560
Gotta, gotta, gotta get your head in the game.

853
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,920
The garage was a bit open.

854
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,240
I guess that's true.

855
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,200
It was a Todd open.

856
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,720
Now I'm kind of, like, obsessed with doing it like this,
though.

857
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:13,100
Oh.

858
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:15,220
Game.

859
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:18,660
Oh yeah.

860
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,340
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

861
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,260
Here, let's finish this area too.

862
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,020
Before I move on to the garage, let's finish one area.

863
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:31,970
I need to keep our composure.

864
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,070
Shut up!

865
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,270
Leaves are the new gold!

866
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:38,850
I told you guys!

867
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:42,170
Scarcity drives the price up!

868
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:43,990
I told you all!

869
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,350
I told you all!

870
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:52,950
The stonks!

871
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,190
Now we get 250 for a full bag.

872
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:18,070
Bye, bye, bye!

873
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,930
It's because there's no trees left because we killed the war
axe.

874
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:26,010
The Sneed.

875
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:29,170
That movie was crazy.

876
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:34,150
That movie was...

877
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:36,830
I watched it for the first time not too long ago.

878
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:53,630
like last year I'm pretty sure it was and I was just amazed
at it this is so bizarre how bad can I be like I understand

879
01:05:53,630 --> 01:06:10,030
I kind of get his appeal the Rizzler oh yeah baby I kind of
get his appeal but at the same time the book is better This

880
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:11,050
should let us into the

881
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:15,470
shed, right?

882
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:16,770
Actually, what is the shed?

883
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,710
I just realized there's some on the roof.

884
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,940
Oh, so when you clean up an area, oh, it unlocks the
ability.

885
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:33,940
I'm just noticing that.

886
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:34,940
Okay, that's why.

887
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,720
How do you guys think I should, I can get the soccer ball to
touch the basket?

888
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,140
one slur

889
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:04,020
oh my god it's not my fault they're so similar

890
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:19,440
i thought it was a fun movie it's just it was just very i
you know i kind of went in with like a different mindset

891
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:27,740
because of how i know people were about the the the Wensler,
so...

892
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,240
I was like, uh-oh, what if I come out with a new crush?

893
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,280
Get 5,000 leaves.

894
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:41,280
Nice.

895
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,740
How bad it cannot be?

896
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,440
Tumblr has terrible taste.

897
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,920
I think so.

898
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:00,570
Oh, dang it.

899
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:02,030
I thought the lid...

900
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:04,590
I just need to give up.

901
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:06,710
I'm not...

902
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:09,370
I'm never gonna be in the basketball team.

903
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:10,430
I'm stuck in...

904
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:11,470
I'm stuck in theater.

905
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:15,030
I'm never gonna be on the team.

906
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:21,190
I'm stuck in musical theater like a nerd.

907
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,150
You're just too short for it.

908
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:29,350
talking to.

909
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,710
I think it was my mom.

910
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:34,950
She was just like, yeah, I remember when you used to be on
the basketball team.

911
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:40,870
Because I played basketball as a young ghost.

912
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:47,290
I only did it because my friend, she was on the team.

913
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,370
No way.

914
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:52,450
Wow, exactly!

915
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:54,290
That's crazy.

916
01:08:56,710 --> 01:08:58,510
No one realized he was there.

917
01:08:58,530 --> 01:08:59,530
The Wensler's...

918
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:00,330
Oh, there you go.

919
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:02,150
The Wieselower.

920
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:05,970
How do we...

921
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:06,190
Okay.

922
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:06,770
Alright.

923
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:07,670
We have two things.

924
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:08,490
Grab.

925
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,650
Can I, like, kick really hard?

926
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:12,390
No.

927
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:14,010
There's no, like, build up.

928
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:17,530
If I kick it, like...

929
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,120
The Twizzler.

930
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,320
Can you grab it?

931
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,340
Yeah, but I can't pick it up.

932
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:31,760
Sprint kick.

933
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:32,280
Sprint kick.

934
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:36,470
Hold on.

935
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:40,590
If I can, like, get it perfectly aligned.

936
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:45,130
I thought it would go, broop.

937
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:48,370
Do it like Conan.

938
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:50,630
I need the...

939
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:53,170
I need it to come out of my pants.

940
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:56,070
Not my pants, my belt.

941
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:56,590
Sorry.

942
01:09:58,770 --> 01:09:59,290
No!

943
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:03,580
Oh.

944
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:06,720
Whoa.

945
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,800
Oh, my God.

946
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:14,820
Into it.

947
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:15,200
No.

948
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,160
Is there a trash can?

949
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,620
Okay, good, good.

950
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,460
Oh, geez.

951
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,440
Six dollars.

952
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,240
Stingy.

953
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,860
I can rest for a bit.

954
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:40,800
I see a card right there.

955
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,260
This is nice.

956
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,680
This is nice.

957
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:50,040
Oh, there's a mountain range out there.

958
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,700
Oh, I could get used to this.

959
01:10:58,780 --> 01:10:59,280
Oh, no!

960
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,700
I could get used to something like this.

961
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:10,230
Yes.

962
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:11,670
Good.

963
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,850
Wait, do we have new journal things now?

964
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,870
Collect the mysterious photos, hit the basket.

965
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:16,670
Pire.

966
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:18,730
Bag tying sprint crouch.

967
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:19,930
Get into the shed.

968
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:21,270
What's the shed?

969
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:22,770
I'm in the basement.

970
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:23,430
Swings.

971
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:26,210
Oh, this is the shed.

972
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:26,970
Okay.

973
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:32,970
I'm keen for a leaf blower.

974
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:36,330
We're so close to being able to buy it.

975
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:38,830
Like, no joke.

976
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,550
Hit the basket, says two out of three.

977
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:44,730
I know because I know not.

978
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:46,050
I do it with the soccer ball.

979
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:49,270
Maybe with the leaf blower, right?

980
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:56,100
Maybe if we have the leaf blower, we'll be able to do it.

981
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:12,700
There's gotta be a key in here for the shed, but also how
mysterious this vent is, right?

982
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,700
Unless there's something else that is throwable.

983
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,460
That's very true.

984
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:21,280
There might be.

985
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,060
Suspicious.

986
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,720
Anyways, how's your guys' weekend going?

987
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,060
How are you guys doing?

988
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,260
Little checkup.

989
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,260
Little checkup of you guys and your lives and afterlives.

990
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:38,200
Hopefully only lives.

991
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,440
Hopefully no afterlives.

992
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,340
It's a robo-bull in the bottom right.

993
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,800
I'm gonna...

994
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,040
I'm gonna...

995
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,280
The delivery person stole my food!

996
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:54,840
Oh!

997
01:12:55,780 --> 01:13:02,760
I've never had that happen, but I also don't use like a
delivery dash very often or anything like that.

998
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,700
That sucks.

999
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:05,960
Why?

1000
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,260
Why would they do that?

1001
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:16,860
I got to sleep in.

1002
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:17,440
Feels great.

1003
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:17,940
Yeah?

1004
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,600
I'm fully trapped in traffic.

1005
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:21,980
Oh my gosh, please.

1006
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,940
Drive safe.

1007
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,760
Don't do not super chat and drive.

1008
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:41,190
I woke up too early.

1009
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:42,970
You can sleep if you want.

1010
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:44,270
Beacons going fine.

1011
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:47,930
It's been consistently negative 40 degrees Fahrenheit
outside.

1012
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:53,430
Also, now I have Gat for the Wensler stuck in my brain.

1013
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:54,690
Thanks, boss.

1014
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:58,890
Sticking out your Gat for the Wensler.

1015
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,410
You're so skibbity.

1016
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:04,610
You're so phantom tax.

1017
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:09,530
Have you guys thought about how, like, none of those things
are popular anymore?

1018
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:14,150
like all of those things are not

1019
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:23,890
things just come and go so quickly

1020
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:36,080
meme lifespan is crazy now I still don't even know what the
phantom tax is

1021
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:45,540
I miss six 69 no you have to you get new numbers now

1022
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,660
we're subtracting numbers now

1023
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:05,860
the leaf value only going up do calculus while super
chatting so you can super chat and derive

1024
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:15,680
derive how about you minto how you doing i'm great I'm good,
I'm good.

1025
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:16,500
Oh, look.

1026
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,960
I know I could make...

1027
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,580
Wait, how much was it?

1028
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,580
It was $49.99.

1029
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:23,980
Okay.

1030
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:29,440
I was going to say I could just make bags, but we're going
for fast cash.

1031
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:31,580
Phantom tax.

1032
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,560
Yeah, if you're sick of...

1033
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:41,220
I think, though, probably those things will be like, you
know...

1034
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:43,940
Old...

1035
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:49,120
funny nostalgic memes for this generation once they're
older.

1036
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,980
It's like, oh yeah, remember what everyone was saying.

1037
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:58,880
Everyone was saying six, seven, man.

1038
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:01,080
Times were simpler.

1039
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,180
Can I just jump over this?

1040
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,100
We bought it.

1041
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,760
We bought it.

1042
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:12,580
The leaf blower.

1043
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:17,760
Holy, even the upgrades for it are expensive.

1044
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,890
Wait, hold on.

1045
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:27,090
Let's test it here.

1046
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:32,550
Uh-oh.

1047
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:35,450
It's a little chaotic.

1048
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:38,570
I can't really control where they go.

1049
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:41,010
Sometimes they get inside the door.

1050
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:44,450
Sometimes they go over into this pile.

1051
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:46,270
I never need to rake again, I think.

1052
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:53,770
The money is just...

1053
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:55,010
It's flowing in.

1054
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:58,410
Oh, the soccer ball!

1055
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:01,050
Oh, wow.

1056
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:13,080
I don't think it's gonna work.

1057
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,380
I think it's too...

1058
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,840
It's too slow.

1059
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,680
It's like too not powerful at all.

1060
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:22,560
People will say six, seven to their grandkids while laughing
and getting embarrassed blank stares in return.

1061
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:29,760
The Gen Z stair.

1062
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,220
I don't know, I think they'll stare back first.

1063
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,960
I think everybody will just be staring at each other.

1064
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,300
Let's close that.

1065
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,360
No, close.

1066
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,240
There we go.

1067
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:45,420
G.

1068
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,080
The Gen G.

1069
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,640
Stare G.

1070
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:54,620
Yeah.

1071
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:55,960
Oh, well.

1072
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:56,940
I don't know.

1073
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:00,800
I feel like people get on kids a lot nowadays, but I
think...

1074
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:06,900
think there were some really stupid things that older old a
lot of older memes were pretty dumb as

1075
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,440
well they're just nostalgic to you so they're funnier

1076
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:33,600
memes are exclusively dumb yeah i think what gets uh i think
what's like i guess nowadays it feels more like shoved in

1077
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:41,380
your face all the time because it's like if you're on if
you're online you're just like oh my gosh all I see is this

1078
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:54,200
thing and so they get it's like beaten down like it's just
beating a dead horse like crazy and then that's why they die

1079
01:18:54,200 --> 01:19:02,720
because everybody does it for like two weeks and then it's
done we're planking there were kids out there planking on

1080
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,300
various items we were all having.

1081
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:08,740
It's all silly.

1082
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:17,370
The kids, the children crave whimsy.

1083
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:18,210
Maybe.

1084
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:20,290
They just don't realize.

1085
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:23,290
They crave whimsy, but they don't know.

1086
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:27,490
The memes, Jeff.

1087
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:40,590
Like, I, oh my gosh, remember when they made, like, rage
comics into books and stuff for school.

1088
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:47,510
They were like, why you know homework?

1089
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:55,770
I wish I did it.

1090
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:01,590
Me gusto.

1091
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,560
My cringe moments are going to the grave with me.

1092
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,060
being cringe, something about being free.

1093
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:16,660
Oh, I get it, though.

1094
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,260
Don't tell us all.

1095
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:20,780
They don't need to know.

1096
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,380
They don't need to know.

1097
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:32,740
I feel like the leaves like in the corners here are kind of
dangerous.

1098
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,060
You can't see them.

1099
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:41,460
Lucky for me, all of my cringe moments are recorded on live
stream.

1100
01:20:43,600 --> 01:21:00,100
Well, maybe not all of my cringe moments, but a good
majority of them I can never escape I feel like even though

1101
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:08,140
the the leaf blower was great it just caused like a whole
mess now like before I felt very organized now all my leaves

1102
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:18,820
are kind of like everywhere we love those moments though I'm
so glad I I'm so glad that I can make you guys feel better

1103
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,700
about yourselves.

1104
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:22,900
Like, man.

1105
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,780
She's just really dumb.

1106
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:30,160
So glad that I'm smarter than this ghost girl.

1107
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,460
No wonder she's dead.

1108
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,380
I didn't mean to punch it.

1109
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,160
Roll!

1110
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,040
Hope he can return the favor every so often.

1111
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,040
Yeah.

1112
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,860
I'd pay to watch those cringe moments.

1113
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,780
My cringe moments!

1114
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:57,920
No.

1115
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:00,240
Clear.

1116
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,140
And throw!

1117
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:04,220
Yeah.

1118
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,300
We almost have enough for some...

1119
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,300
Oh wait, we do have enough for some...

1120
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:13,500
I only got, like...

1121
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,740
Here, we'll do these.

1122
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,440
And I'll do...

1123
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,380
Yeah, we'll do that.

1124
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:28,180
for prosperity forever and ever until the YouTube servers go
down I

1125
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:42,350
wonder what it would be like the next YouTube kind of crazy
so many have tried and so many have failed many have tried

1126
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:56,320
and all have failed YouTube too yeah I mean nobody thought
anybody could could take out Minecraft and here we are high

1127
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:02,620
tail I kind of really love Hytale, though.

1128
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,400
So far, it's so fun.

1129
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:06,220
Oh, my gosh.

1130
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,800
I see her cringe moments and go, dang, I gotta be more
whimsical.

1131
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,440
Look how happy she is.

1132
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,340
What have we got in here?

1133
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,060
Get into the shed.

1134
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:16,340
Buy all upgrades.

1135
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:18,580
Acquire bag tying, sprint and crouch.

1136
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:19,220
Hit the basket.

1137
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:19,940
Okay.

1138
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:20,900
Yeah.

1139
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:28,740
Isn't Daily Motion technically older?

1140
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,040
Is Daily Motion...

1141
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:35,700
Yeah, but like, I mean, there can always be there will
always be like another video site but something that will

1142
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:43,640
take over like as like the popularity of youtube i don't
know man youtube would i feel like at this point it feels

1143
01:23:43,640 --> 01:24:02,940
like youtube literally has to die to you know it's not be
popular anymore but everybody i mean at the same time nobody

1144
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:09,640
a lot of people don't use facebook anymore there was a time
when i think i would have never thought facebook would not

1145
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:19,380
be like the main platform you know what i mean i have to
make some really bad moves oh yeah new youtube making bad

1146
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:28,700
moves they would never i'm sorry i'm sorry youtube don't
listen to me i love your platform don't make me go to twitch

1147
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,480
I should probably, like, rake this.

1148
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,060
Let's do that.

1149
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,880
Or, actually, blow!

1150
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,920
I wish I liked Twitch more, but I don't.

1151
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:58,280
I feel like the big thing for me is, like, all the...

1152
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,920
all the, um...

1153
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,100
Integrations with Twitch are pretty fun.

1154
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:11,380
And I think there are some platform, or some, like,
companies that are trying to do that with YouTube.

1155
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:15,120
So maybe, you know, and I don't mean like...

1156
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,400
I won't do like a text-to-speech.

1157
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,060
I mean, I think you could do that on YouTube anyway.

1158
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,140
But more like...

1159
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:26,280
Like, you play a game and your chat can play with you kind
of deal or stuff like that.

1160
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,560
I think those are really fun.

1161
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,100
But those are all pretty just...

1162
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:32,960
Just Twitch.

1163
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,100
Oh, we can crouch!

1164
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:35,180
We're sneaking!

1165
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:37,480
Yes.

1166
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:39,280
Sneak.

1167
01:25:46,170 --> 01:26:01,970
I boost play Pokemon yeah that would be a great stream for
when I am like away that would be a great stream for when I

1168
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:10,450
am like on vacation or well I say vacation but I don't know
the last time I took a vacation when I am away from my

1169
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:11,870
computer streaming

1170
01:26:17,530 --> 01:26:28,850
ads during the stream irritate me oh my god and they're so
they're like the worst too they're like yeah no I 100% get

1171
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:39,640
it YouTube gives me actually I think they're well I think
the ad button on YouTube doesn't even work like I think it

1172
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:47,960
doesn't give ads to people I think I boost playing a game
would be far more cohesive than some other fan base You

1173
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:48,700
think so?

1174
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:51,300
I believe in you guys.

1175
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:54,160
I always believe in you guys.

1176
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:56,380
I'm your number one cheerleader.

1177
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,100
Never forget that.

1178
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:01,120
You're just like, I don't know if I can do this.

1179
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:02,780
Always think, wait.

1180
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,380
Minto thinks I can do this.

1181
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:13,610
I am always cheering for you guys.

1182
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:22,280
Thank you.

1183
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:38,500
of course I just have so much faith in you guys maybe too
much shed roof oh

1184
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:55,160

1185
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:06,880
we can can crouch now, but... Oh, all right.

1186
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:09,780
Oh, okay.

1187
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,060
That works too.

1188
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:13,600
Whoa.

1189
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,020
Can I jump over this?

1190
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:15,820
No.

1191
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,320
Oh, wow.

1192
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,420
This place is beautiful, and it's quiet, you know?

1193
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:23,760
Quiet.

1194
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,740
It's so quiet.

1195
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:30,800
There's like, none of the neighbors are being annoying or
loud, except me.

1196
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:34,480
I'm the when being loud and annoying because I'm
leaf-blowing.

1197
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,760
It's so serene.

1198
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,300
Is this what it is like living in a neighborhood?

1199
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,740
I recently just published my first scientific paper.

1200
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:53,780
I wanted to say thank you.

1201
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,480
My kamioshi for your huge source of inspiration.

1202
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,000
Mito kudo!

1203
01:28:58,980 --> 01:28:59,860
What the heck?

1204
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:01,620
Cool potato!

1205
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,980
You're so cool!

1206
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:04,260
Scientific.

1207
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:05,580
You're smart!

1208
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,040
Wow!

1209
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:07,600
See?

1210
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:09,320
This is what I mean.

1211
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:11,760
I have the most faith in you guys.

1212
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:12,860
That's so awesome!

1213
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:13,840
Congratulations!

1214
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,380
Ibu in high places.

1215
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:22,700
That's awesome!

1216
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,860
Wait, oh, I'm...

1217
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:40,030
And thank you so much for the pink too!

1218
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:42,770
You should be celebrating!

1219
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:45,750
What delicious food!

1220
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:48,950
It's so funny.

1221
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:58,250
I got like, you know, I prepared my maid cafe for the
potential ice of everything, the snow storms.

1222
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:07,310
And I'm like, but all I want is everything that I didn't buy
for food.

1223
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:13,630
It took about two years of learning machining, but just
yesterday I finally made my first thing for other people

1224
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:14,330
that I engineered.

1225
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:15,630
That's not a prototype.

1226
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:21,230
And now they want me to design more things to sell!

1227
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:22,890
Oh my gosh, Senshi!

1228
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:24,750
What the heck?

1229
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:27,370
You guys are, like, actual geniuses?

1230
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:32,230
We have real geniuses in the chat.

1231
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:35,410
Oh my gosh, that's so awesome!

1232
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:36,750
Congrats!

1233
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:45,730
So many Twitch VTubers I'd like to watch but can't because
all the TTS and alerts cause my sensory overload.

1234
01:30:48,170 --> 01:30:48,670
way.

1235
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:55,310
I prefer a much more like classic kind of just a normal type
stream.

1236
01:30:57,850 --> 01:31:06,650
Like I understand like it's very fine with all the bells and
whistles but and it's you know it's not that I'm like I

1237
01:31:06,650 --> 01:31:08,070
don't want to say lazy about it.

1238
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:13,130
Like I don't want people to think like oh she doesn't add
all these things to her stream because like she's just lazy.

1239
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:17,930
I just actually prefer like such a regular experience.

1240
01:31:19,610 --> 01:31:20,090
Naoki!

1241
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:23,310
Thank you!

1242
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:24,390
Thank you!

1243
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:25,850
You're an old school gal.

1244
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:27,130
I really am.

1245
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:30,310
Thanks to you, Minto.

1246
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:36,070
We were able to to to keep me sane while I was painting an
airport in Wyoming.

1247
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:37,290
What the heck?

1248
01:31:38,710 --> 01:31:39,830
Painting an airport.

1249
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:43,210
That sounds like a big task.

1250
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:45,170
That sounds like, oh my gosh, don't say that.

1251
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:49,630
Some dev is gonna be listening in chat and it's just like,
Painting an airport.

1252
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:52,030
That sounds like a game idea.

1253
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:03,410
Wait.

1254
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:05,610
I was trying to get it through the wall.

1255
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:09,470
Takes notes.

1256
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:14,330
Some dev is going to be like, oh yeah, we need another leaf.

1257
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:15,470
Leaf it alone.

1258
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:17,470
We need another power wash.

1259
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:24,070
Honestly, though, like I said, these games are so
satisfying.

1260
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:27,390
There's a bajillion clones.

1261
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:31,350
Because they're very great for streaming.

1262
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:34,310
And they're satisfying.

1263
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:40,160
So I honestly don't mind.

1264
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:44,610
Airport painting simulator.

1265
01:32:45,210 --> 01:32:46,590
Yes, this has potential.

1266
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:52,050
Everybody's getting in on it now.

1267
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:54,130
Somebody's got to do it first.

1268
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:56,250
Oh no!

1269
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:58,550
The gate doesn't say oh.

1270
01:32:58,570 --> 01:32:59,670
Okay, we got a hand.

1271
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:00,950
We got a hand do this.

1272
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:03,850
We were trained here.

1273
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:06,090
We were trained for this.

1274
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:10,960
House flipper.

1275
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:11,660
Yeah!

1276
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:13,420
Very house flipper, right?

1277
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:15,560
Except it's an airport.

1278
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:21,980
Kobe!

1279
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,540
That should have been in.

1280
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:30,220
Baggage check simulator.

1281
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,360
There's this new game.

1282
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,020
Quarantine something something.

1283
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:36,180
Um, that's...

1284
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:39,080
I like those kinds of, like, paper please types games, too.

1285
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,960
They're just, like, puzzly enough, you know what I mean?

1286
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,200
And, like, kind of keep your attention.

1287
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:46,460
The zombie one!

1288
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:47,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1289
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:49,360
Can I hire you to do my yard next?

1290
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:53,700
It feels, like, negative 5 degrees Fahrenheit outside, and I
don't want to.

1291
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,640
Why my ectoplasm will freeze?

1292
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:03,160
Yeah, I'm a big fan of those types of games.

1293
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:07,400
Pre-check people for zombie virus.

1294
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:08,780
Yeah, it looks fun.

1295
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:10,760
Like, papers, please.

1296
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,320
No, I'm not human is kind of like that, too.

1297
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,420
I'm working on my first novel.

1298
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:19,220
Oh, my gosh.

1299
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,420
Pitch it us.

1300
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:21,340
Pitch it to us, Wally.

1301
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,280
I unlocked the grill.

1302
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:28,320
The grill?

1303
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:29,980
Is this the grill?

1304
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:31,900
Oh.

1305
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:32,920
Oh.

1306
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:37,210
Can I grill?

1307
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:41,010
Is this area just a grill?

1308
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:46,100
Unlock the leisure area.

1309
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:53,830
We'll do air spread.

1310
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:57,930
What's this one?

1311
01:34:59,530 --> 01:35:00,190
Cute.

1312
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:05,570
This kitchen's not the same with...

1313
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:07,590
Out you!

1314
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:12,270
There we go.

1315
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:14,570
We found what we need for the basket.

1316
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,920
It's just a spoon.

1317
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,160
It's just a greasy grill.

1318
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:28,300
Without you.

1319
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:33,580
Oh my god, the collision.

1320
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:35,760
Oh my god.

1321
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,040
I'm really...

1322
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:43,340
Oh my god, please.

1323
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:44,440
This thing is huge.

1324
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:50,600
Now put the load.

1325
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:51,820
shit in the basket.

1326
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:00,500
Yeah!

1327
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:03,860
Hit a basket with a basketball.

1328
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,380
Beach ball and a leaf bag.

1329
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:07,840
We did it!

1330
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:12,560
As soon as I saw it, I was like, I know.

1331
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:14,640
I know what must be dying.

1332
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:19,520
Alright.

01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:26,480

The single leaf.

01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:46,410
It mocks me.

1352
01:38:51,790 --> 01:38:53,630
All right, watch this.

1353
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:58,440
Come on.

All right, do we have enough money?

1355
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:06,940
Yes.

So satisfying.

1360
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:47,500
We're already at 32 blocks, guys.

1361
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:48,080
Crazy.

1362
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:11,470
It's like all the money in the world.

01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:15,270
We're, well, finally, we're dollar by dollar.

Hot dog.

01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,120
Hot dog, indeed!

I feel like I'm missing something.

1382
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:23,920
Global economic domination, one leaf at a time.

1383
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,680
Yeah, baby!

1384
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:28,120

the pool is at 69 percent nice is this a way for

1392
01:42:46,650 --> 01:42:53,810
nice i feel like i'm not doing this most efficient way but
you know what it doesn't matter we're still making the cash

1393
01:42:53,810 --> 01:42:59,170
money like sometimes the leaves just don't blow in like but

1394
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:11,780

about it you know what actually hold on we'll buy these And

1396

this would be good also.

1397
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,800
I'm just buying stuff.

1398
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,020
I'm not even reading what it does.

1399
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:35,400
I'm like, yeah, it's more upgrades.

1400
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:36,700
It doesn't matter.

1401
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:38,700
You can't see the money?

1402
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:40,360
Let me move you guys over.

1403
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:41,940
I'll move you guys over to the other side.

1404
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,480
Wait, it's so lonely.

1405
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:55,580
There's like nothing over here, though.

1406
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:58,840
There's like just kind of the...

1407
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:02,620
Like I've just been blocking this part.

1408
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
You guys are so far away.

1409
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:27,340
Put us back.

1410
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:29,540
No, you have to see the money.

1411
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:35,420
I wonder how many more.

1412
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:36,920
Oh, I guess the hedge maze.

1413
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:38,360
And then...

1414
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,380
How do you even speedrun this game?

1415
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:43,960
What is the speedrun for this game?

1416
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:57,000
Also, how do they not, how does this not like clog their,
their vents?

1417
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:02,730
Pick up leafs, but bash.

1418
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:05,090
Put us in the big portal.

1419
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:10,990
Good times.

1420
01:45:14,030 --> 01:45:15,310
No, no, go this way.

1421
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:16,570
Go that way.

1422
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:19,230
I'm just like trying to move them.

1423
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:22,270
I have like a lot of individual leaves, you know?

1424
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:25,810
Not idea.

1425
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:36,200
To any percent is 20 minutes!

1426
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:41,160
That's wild!

1427
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,240
20 minutes!

1428
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:49,480
Giving the leaves to the bowl, man.

1429
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:50,220
Yeah.

1430
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:54,220
Well, they pay top dollars, so.

1431
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:56,940
They can take it all they want.

1432
01:46:02,630 --> 01:46:04,130
The leaf blower has its faults.

1433
01:46:05,190 --> 01:46:06,950
It's great, but it does have its faults.

1434
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:14,060
The head of the rake really is small, isn't it?

1435
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:27,420
It's average.

1436
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:28,820
Why are you getting it?

1437
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:31,160
Why are you taking it out so personally, right, Snat?

1438
01:46:45,070 --> 01:46:46,690
The pool was cold.

1439
01:46:49,150 --> 01:46:51,130
Wait, how have I not completed the pool?

1440
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:52,390
Oh.

1441
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:56,450
Is it me or is it getting?

1442
01:46:56,790 --> 01:46:57,330
Oh, gosh.

1443
01:46:57,650 --> 01:46:59,690
You know, everything we saw was blue.

1444
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:03,210
So now it's like ultra orange.

1445
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:04,050
Oh, my God.

1446
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:16,670
Orange.

1447
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:21,350
You, whoa, yeah, ultra orange.

1448
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:27,390
I said what I said.

1449
01:47:31,730 --> 01:47:36,990
If you guys didn't know, UOs, like the things that people
break at concerts, that are really...

1450
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:40,410
The glow sticks, the UO stands for Ultra Orange.

1451
01:47:40,930 --> 01:47:43,190
So if you get like a UV, it's like ultraviolet.

1452
01:47:44,050 --> 01:47:48,390
It's an office romance about a guy befriending a smart but
shy skunk woman.

1453
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:53,250
That's your, what your novel's about!

1454
01:47:56,190 --> 01:47:57,030
I'm in.

1455
01:47:58,710 --> 01:47:59,710
Give me the lightie.

1456
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:01,350
Let me have her.

1457
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:07,930
Ugh, this sucks.

1458
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:09,450
I should have blown all of this.

1459
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:12,010
I don't know why didn't I blow all of this into the pool.

1460
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:17,590
It ain't too late.

1461
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:28,070
Even though you have almost half a million subs, you still
give off that cozy, smaller streamer energy, which is great.

1462
01:48:29,230 --> 01:48:31,070
I'm glad you're thinking that.

1463
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:33,930
We need UM sticks, Ultra Minto.

1464
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:36,690
Ultra Minto.

1465
01:48:37,870 --> 01:48:39,050
I'm already Ultra Minto.

1466
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:45,640
I'm gonna become the Joker.

1467
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:49,200
I'm going to become the Joker.

1468
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:51,640
Crap, grab, grab.

1469
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:58,180
I guess what we could do, what would be more efficient is
blowing them this way.

1470
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:01,200
Joining them with their other brethren.

1471
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:05,960
Into the vent.

1472
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:10,160
All leaves must be vented.

1473
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,340
Wait, can I blow the...

1474
01:49:13,340 --> 01:49:16,600
Oh, imagine if I, like, was able to blow the leaves from the
other side.

1475
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:17,860
It'd be kind of crazy.

1476
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:23,320
Why are you guys doing clown?

1477
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:25,640
What did I say?

1478
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:29,580
Oh, the Joker.

1479
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:30,460
That's right.

1480
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:31,560
Yeah, I did say that.

1481
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,680
I didn't say I was gonna become the Joker.

1482
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:35,580
Oh.

1483
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:39,160
I didn't say I've become the Joker.

1484
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,980
I just gotta keep on picking up.

1485
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:08,840
Alright, alright, alright.

1486
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:18,720
We got this?

1487
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:20,140
A bag?

1488
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,220
How nostalgic?

1489
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:22,500
What?

1490
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:25,020
Are you like, oh, my childhood of...

1491
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:26,740
of...

1492
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:27,920
breaking the leaves.

1493
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:33,440
One thing I don't really understand is, like, why...

1494
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:35,000
People don't like...

1495
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:46,300
having foliage in their yards like why why did like a yard
with no trees no bushes like grass only become like such an

1496
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:55,260
ideal aesthetic to people i don't i don't quite get it like
i guess like

1497
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:10,490
i guess like yeah there are like certain bugs and stuff that
like it prevents from stuff but i don't i just i'm like you

1498
01:51:10,490 --> 01:51:20,050
have no you're you they have no personality but also like at
the same time i get like you know when you see really high

1499
01:51:20,050 --> 01:51:29,680
grass you're like oh my gosh i understand that i blew all of
this in here just to pick it up with my hands in the end

1500
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:41,640
i bet the hoa is that full i agree

1501
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:49,070
and bushes have to be looked after.

1502
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:50,750
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

1503
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:54,490
That is very true.

1504
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:06,340
All right, blow, blow, blow away, blow, blow away.

1505
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:16,260
I'm sure landscaping is nice or IMO, but sometimes it's HOA
maintenance or neighborhoods just to new for stuff.

1506
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:19,940
Wait, how, wait, I can't read.

1507
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:22,220
What?

1508
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:28,000
I can't take it up here!

1509
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:28,920
Oh my gosh.

1510
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:33,870
Too new for stuff.

1511
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:34,510
Oh!

1512
01:52:35,570 --> 01:52:36,770
Right, right, right.

1513
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:46,200
I understand.

1514
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:47,860
Oh, we have $41.

1515
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:49,180
Let's upgrade.

1516
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:53,240
Precision, I think, is important.

1517
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:54,220
I can't write.

1518
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:55,080
Your reading is fine.

1519
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:56,540
Sometimes...

1520
01:52:56,540 --> 01:53:02,420
Thank you, Dargo.

1521
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:19,820
you can write I can't read that's the cold hard facts the
cold hard facts of it okay so besides the photos which we

1522
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:20,640
have five

1523
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:36,740
I wish it would tell us if we oh we have a greenhouse secret
room and we have a maze wait I'm sorry did that say 29 000

1524
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:45,000
leaves i'm sorry

1525
01:53:51,690 --> 01:54:00,910
this people were saying you could get this you could finish
this game in two hours i'm letting you guys know that the

1526
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:13,710
green house is orange house orange and red and yellow house
that's a lot of leaves when they say leave it alone they

1527
01:54:13,710 --> 01:54:26,200
mean definitely that area well not 100% oh they did the
reviews were like yeah you can 100% this game in two hours I

1528
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:36,840
think they're beasts I think I think everybody who's doing
that okay I usually don't like to say that somebody doesn't

1529
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:49,460
have a life but oh my god what are you a leaf blowing pro
they lied as easily as they leafed might be slightly more

1530
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:58,020
efficient what are you talking about I am peak efficiency I
even meant to leave that one leaf right there unattended

1531
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:11,580
you've never seen more efficiency in your afterlife ever
life sorry you guys are alive I'm the dead one my bad leaf

1532
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:17,000
blowing is their life they are extremely serious How's your
week been, Minto?

1533
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:19,160
My week's been okay.

1534
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:23,820
Not bad at all.

1535
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:25,020
Not bad at all.

1536
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:26,160
I

1537
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:34,220
mean, like, I get that you're not...

1538
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:37,320
You have to, like, get all the leaves, though, to unlock the
next area.

1539
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,140
That's the thing.

1540
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:48,610
So I'm like, I feel like to beat the game, you have to 100%
it, no?

1541
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:03,220
She doesn't know about the leaves, Skip.

1542
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:06,700
Maybe there's like skips.

1543
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:09,580
Let me in.

1544
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:10,020
Let me in.

1545
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:10,580
Let me in.

1546
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:13,980
Let me in.

1547
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:14,960
Wall jumps.

1548
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:24,080
Well, we're at 75%.

1549
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:27,880
I feel like that deserves a...

1550
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:29,560
That's all we need, though.

1551
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:36,140
Playing with a leaf blower.

1552
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:37,300
Squidward...

1553
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:39,980
Flying with a leaf blower.

1554
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:09,450
was the pool at 99.2% 99.1% I think it's because some of the
leaves from the pool got mixed up with our leaves in here so

1555
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:17,510
I think that's how that works for some reason they don't
count them as the I guess because that would like make it

1556
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:19,070
more than a hundred percent, right?

1557
01:57:21,230 --> 01:57:26,030
So they become, they stay leaves of the pool.

1558
01:57:31,570 --> 01:57:34,190
Flying with a leaf blower.

1559
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:39,130
So funny.

1560
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:47,900
No, please.

1561
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,560
Please leaf.

1562
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:58,360
I wish the value of the leaves would go up, though.

1563
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:01,720
I'm getting a tattoo of you on Monday.

1564
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:02,800
What?

1565
01:58:05,830 --> 01:58:07,730
That's gonna be on your body.

1566
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:09,210
Oh, see, see, see.

1567
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:10,650
Some of the pool leaves went in there.

1568
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:13,510
That's gonna be on your body forever.

1569
01:58:14,370 --> 01:58:16,810
Unless you laser it off.

1570
01:58:16,970 --> 01:58:19,290
But that's even more money.

1571
01:58:22,130 --> 01:58:23,010
That's crazy.

1572
01:58:24,090 --> 01:58:25,030
I can't wait to see them.

1573
01:58:25,050 --> 01:58:39,220
get in there get in there like some of these I'm obviously
just gonna grab with my hand these guys in here they're

1574
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:40,840
pissing me off so

1575
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:52,160
we'll just grab them oh gosh if I can oh geez oh geez oh
geez

1576
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:59,090
one leaf out of time literally Quite literally one leaf at a
time.

1577
01:59:05,850 --> 01:59:06,150
Yeah.

1578
01:59:06,590 --> 01:59:07,170
There we go.

1579
01:59:07,570 --> 01:59:07,850
Yeah.

1580
01:59:08,330 --> 01:59:09,090
A little more.

1581
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:11,250
A little bit more to the left.

1582
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:12,210
Yeah.

1583
01:59:14,190 --> 01:59:15,390
Around the table.

1584
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,220
The tables are my demise.

1585
01:59:26,290 --> 01:59:27,130
Right there?

1586
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:28,350
Yes!

1587
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:30,070
I think that's all of them.

1588
01:59:32,930 --> 01:59:33,470
Yippee!

1589
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:33,890
Okay.

1590
01:59:34,350 --> 01:59:36,830
I'm just gonna keep grabbing with my hands until I fill this
up.

1591
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:38,130
Okay.

1592
01:59:53,200 --> 02:00:00,140
summoning salt to give us leaf at a load speed run history
what is that who is that

1593
02:00:05,110 --> 02:00:14,770
what is like the most popular game to speed run is it mario
i feel like super mario is really popular

1594
02:00:17,890 --> 02:00:25,770
Metroid Minecraft Oh Yeah Yeah

1595
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:34,700
Minecraft at the moment Oh crazy

1596
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:47,960
I know it's late It's not as easy picking up with my hands
But it feels a bit faster than trying to direct it Into the

1597
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:53,440
hole Not as efficient but Yeah

1598
02:00:58,910 --> 02:01:07,190
Speed running seems fun, but speed running Minecraft is
always fun because especially if it's like, you know, not

1599
02:01:07,190 --> 02:01:09,950
like a specific seed.

1600
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:13,110
And so, you know, it's a completely random run.

1601
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:14,830
It's always fun to see, I think.

1602
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:22,230
Don't forget you have a rake.

1603
02:01:22,390 --> 02:01:23,190
Can it get in there?

1604
02:01:23,310 --> 02:01:24,130
I don't even know.

1605
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:28,710
Maybe it can.

1606
02:01:28,890 --> 02:01:29,550
I don't know.

1607
02:01:31,710 --> 02:01:33,710
The tables are my demise, for real.

1608
02:01:38,570 --> 02:01:40,290
Okay, alright, here we go.

1609
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:44,150
That was it, right?

1610
02:01:44,650 --> 02:01:45,490
Wait, what did I miss?

1611
02:01:46,610 --> 02:01:48,170
Oh, oh, a single leaf.

1612
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,350
Yeah!

1613
02:01:54,690 --> 02:01:55,090
Yippee!

1614
02:02:00,850 --> 02:02:03,540
Power, more max power, let's go.

1615
02:02:06,810 --> 02:02:08,610
Well spotted, thank you.

1616
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:09,490
And the pool?

1617
02:02:10,810 --> 02:02:12,090
100% let's go.

1618
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:13,950
Oh wait, no pool is still 99.

1619
02:02:14,890 --> 02:02:15,490
Oh no.

1620
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:18,370

1622
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:21,650
Oh!

1623
02:02:24,350 --> 02:02:27,390

Oh, yeah.

1630
02:03:11,860 --> 02:03:13,260
Oh, yeah.

1631
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:13,620
Oh, yeah.

1632
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:16,180
Ooh.

1633
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:17,940
Can I open this then?

1634
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:21,260
Awesome.

1635
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:25,820
Is this prepared?

1636
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:27,340
Is this prepared?

1637
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:27,400
No.

1638
02:03:30,490 --> 02:03:30,870
No.

1639
02:03:30,950 --> 02:03:32,710
All right, time to start hand grabbing again.

1640
02:03:34,110 --> 02:03:38,090
thought i heard you bring him up once must have been someone
else summoning salt is a youtuber that makes long videos on

1641
02:03:38,090 --> 02:03:45,690
the history of certain speedrun categories for games i might
have watched him before and i just don't remember you're

1642
02:03:45,690 --> 02:03:51,270
totally good though flufeos i am a casual speedrunner
enjoyer

1643
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:02,020
casual speedrunner enjoyer

1644
02:04:07,330 --> 02:04:08,750
really big during the pandemic

1645
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:13,410
popular speedrun.

1646
02:04:15,150 --> 02:04:16,890
Oh, I guess it's, well.

1647
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:21,770
Portal.

1648
02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:22,870
Huh.

1649
02:04:25,670 --> 02:04:27,570
That's really surprising.

1650
02:04:27,850 --> 02:04:31,610
Even after all this time that portal would still be?

1651
02:04:33,530 --> 02:04:35,410
My dead Oshi, she cleaned so well.

1652
02:04:35,590 --> 02:04:37,010
I am a maid after all.

1653
02:04:39,230 --> 02:04:46,250
It doesn't feel like so many leaves here like it does, but
it doesn't at the same time.

1654
02:04:51,220 --> 02:04:53,080
Low entry barrier, short run.

1655
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:54,220
That's true.

1656
02:04:55,540 --> 02:05:00,140
It's also a Barney game where one of the speedrun categories
is any percent no controller.

1657
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:06,220
Play itself if you leave it alone and just RNG how quickly
it finishes.

1658
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:08,300
Should we try that?

1659
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:11,800
What if we got the speedrun?

1660
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:14,960
What if we got the world record?

1661
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:24,760
Yeah, I was like, I also was thinking Barney from Half-Life
or Barney the Dino?

1662
02:05:26,900 --> 02:05:28,240
Should we Barney game?

1663
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:45,830
Barney game for the Sega Genesis?

1664
02:05:47,110 --> 02:05:48,190
What the hell?

1665
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:52,160
That's crazy.

1666
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:57,680
I do know that we have enough.

1667
02:05:58,060 --> 02:05:58,760
Wait, do we?

1668
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:02,760
We have enough for this one over, not this one.

1669
02:06:02,900 --> 02:06:04,480
This is 25, I think, over here.

1670
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:07,700
Oh, see!

1671
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:11,100
Happy birthday!

1672
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:15,860
One second, let me sing.

1673
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:21,400
Is this VOD?

1674
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:22,180
Not the VOD.

1675
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:24,960
I am dead, but I am here.

1676
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:29,760
Happy birthday to you.

1677
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:52,220

1678
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:59,660
welcome to the jungle infiltrate the secret room interesting

1679
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:08,160
Now that I have better precision and stuff, this is way
easier.

1680
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:09,300
Oh

1681
02:07:13,070 --> 02:07:15,870
yeah!

1682
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:28,700
Nice.

1683
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:30,060
Nice.

1684
02:07:31,580 --> 02:07:31,980
Nice!

1685
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:36,720
Just go down the tunnel.

1686
02:07:37,540 --> 02:07:38,380
So fast.

1687
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:38,900
I know.

1688
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:46,820
We've got lots of leaves.

1689
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:48,660
Oh, welcome to the jungle.

1690
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:53,020
Where nobody lives.

1691
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:55,280
They leave?

1692
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:57,540
They leave, but they don't leave.

1693
02:08:07,050 --> 02:08:08,150
Oh, yeah.

1694
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:13,260
That was awesome.

1695
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:16,820
But the leaves are leaving.

1696
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:27,600
Closing time.

1697
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:35,140
You don't have to go home, but you can't leave here.

1698
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:38,260
How many?

1699
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:42,080
How many songs can we incorporate leaf into?

1700
02:08:45,980 --> 02:08:47,860
I'm not gonna bother with these guys.

1701
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:48,980
There we go, okay.

1702
02:08:49,580 --> 02:08:52,140
Actually, I'm not gonna lie.

1703
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:53,860
I think there's enough here that I could just grab a ball.

1704
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:00,080
Nice.

1705
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:03,880
Upgrade strength.

1706
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:06,640
Oh, okay.

1707
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:10,920
Wait, the maze is already 100%.

1708
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:13,540
Oh my gosh, speed run.

1709
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:17,280
Speedrun real?

1710
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:31,120
Okay, $40 for the airstream with I believe I can fly I
believe I can touch the sky I think about every now and then

1711
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:35,000
My leaves going into the vent

1712
02:09:48,790 --> 02:09:50,230
Too good

1713
02:09:54,690 --> 02:09:57,430
Yeah, let's just blow everything out of here.

1714
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:58,950
You know?

1715
02:10:03,090 --> 02:10:04,790
Such a silly stream.

1716
02:10:06,550 --> 02:10:08,310
Well, we're silly people.

1717
02:10:10,690 --> 02:10:12,490
Anything can be a silly stream.

1718
02:10:13,890 --> 02:10:15,050
If you're silly enough.

1719
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:18,670
Remember the whimsy in your lives, everybody.

1720
02:10:20,990 --> 02:10:23,570
Remember the whimsy in your lives.

1721
02:10:25,510 --> 02:10:28,110
Remember who you are.

1722
02:10:33,330 --> 02:10:34,370
Thanks, Peter Pan.

1723
02:10:34,570 --> 02:10:36,050
What is that supposed to mean?

1724
02:10:41,450 --> 02:10:46,410
I kind of wish it just sucked up the leaves rather than me
having to, like, blow it, you know?

1725
02:10:48,730 --> 02:10:52,750
Like, it kind of does if it's really close within proximity,
but it doesn't always.

1726
02:10:54,530 --> 02:10:57,810
Like, look, these are right in front of it, and they just...

1727
02:10:58,510 --> 02:10:59,610
Not strong enough.

1728
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:06,450
I am Minky's silliest soldier.

1729
02:11:07,930 --> 02:11:09,850
Silly soldier reporting for duty?

1730
02:11:11,870 --> 02:11:12,990
What would a silly duty be?

1731
02:11:13,730 --> 02:11:14,970
Maybe this game.

1732
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:16,450
Wait a second.

1733
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:18,610
What time is the denser to collab at?

1734
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:31,900
In 45 minutes!

1735
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:33,420
Oh no!

1736
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:35,340
Guys, we got a speedrun.

1737
02:11:37,940 --> 02:11:39,640
I thought I would be able to beat it.

1738
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:45,240
be able to beat the game we might just be able to get into
the secret spot and then

1739
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:57,120
leafing on a jet plane what's that one we were too silly we
were too silly

1740
02:12:01,380 --> 02:12:06,680
oh my gosh vtuber your optimization is so poor

1741
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,760
area and just clear it.

1742
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:16,920
That's what we'll do.

1743
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:22,820
Maybe it like a leaf.

1744
02:12:23,200 --> 02:12:23,960
Wait, what this?

1745
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:24,920
Oh.

1746
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:28,000
We have $70.

1747
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:30,520
Hold on.

1748
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:32,740
We gotta get upgrades, upgrades, upgrades.

1749
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:35,440
46.

1750
02:12:35,640 --> 02:12:36,400
We could do that easy.

1751
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:50,160
Speedrunning is super cool.

1752
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:51,280
They even do charity events.

1753
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:53,060
Yeah, I love AGDQ.

1754
02:12:54,100 --> 02:12:54,500
Silly.

1755
02:12:54,660 --> 02:12:55,740
Too close to the sun.

1756
02:12:56,240 --> 02:12:58,660
Thank you guys for the super chats.

1757
02:12:58,740 --> 02:12:59,820
Thank you.

1758
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:01,460
Thank you very much.

1759
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:05,340
I really appreciate it.

1760
02:13:06,980 --> 02:13:09,380
I'm Mintiana Grande.

1761
02:13:14,590 --> 02:13:15,470
Yeah.

1762
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:19,050
Silly too close to the sun.

1763
02:13:19,570 --> 02:13:19,570
Yeah.

1764
02:13:21,330 --> 02:13:22,830
Always having too much fun.

1765
02:13:23,310 --> 02:13:23,310
Yeah.

1766
02:13:37,070 --> 02:13:39,190
Yes, yes, beautiful.

1767
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:40,610
Get sucked.

1768
02:13:40,990 --> 02:13:41,330
Get sucked.

1769
02:13:41,670 --> 02:13:42,050
Get sucked.

1770
02:13:43,270 --> 02:13:43,710
Get sucked.

1771
02:13:44,670 --> 02:13:45,630
All right.

1772
02:13:45,790 --> 02:13:46,370
Out of the greenhouse.

1773
02:13:46,950 --> 02:13:48,030
Everybody out of the greenhouse.

1774
02:13:48,430 --> 02:13:49,070
Out of the greenhouse.

1775
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:55,810
It's a good thing that I was in a coma for nine years
because all my plants died.

1776
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:03,650
Greenhouse is basically emptied.

1777
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:12,780
Wait.

1778
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:13,740
Upgrade.

1779
02:14:22,310 --> 02:14:23,650
We gotta get stuff out of here too.

1780
02:14:24,690 --> 02:14:27,110
I'm gonna just grab it from underneath.

1781
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:35,320
I think it'll be too difficult to...

1782
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:36,840
You heard her here, folks.

1783
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:37,620
What did I say?

1784
02:14:38,100 --> 02:14:38,980
What am I saying?

1785
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:40,340
Don't listen to me.

1786
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:42,180
I'm a silly person on the internet.

1787
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:44,740
I literally speak no facts.

1788
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:50,360
I'm a silly person on the internet.

1789
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:52,160
I've never said the truth in my life.

1790
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,160
Okay.

1791
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:00,660
Now, why is there a hole here?

1792
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:10,820
She lies for a living.

1793
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:12,720
I'm convinced they're still in a coma.

1794
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:13,500
I know.

1795
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:16,360
What a silly dream.

1796
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:19,220
You ever think of, like, games that are, like, so silly?

1797
02:15:19,380 --> 02:15:21,340
You're just, like, where did this concept come from?

1798
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:23,000
Like, was it a dream?

1799
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:27,000
I had a dream last night.

1800
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:29,340
I was trying to get back to a hotel.

1801
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:32,440
And, um...

1802
02:15:33,180 --> 02:15:33,980
And, uh...

1803
02:15:33,980 --> 02:15:41,100
There was, like, a coffee convention on the way to my hotel,
and, like, I went inside, and they were, like, it was, like,

1804
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:46,360
Starbucks, and, like, Dunkin' Donuts, and just, like, a
bunch of coffee place, and they're, like, they were, like,

1805
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:49,700
bombarding me, being, like, you have to try our coffee!

1806
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:53,160
Like, going real crazy at it.

1807
02:15:56,320 --> 02:16:03,840
I was, like, and then, also, um, what was, there's, like,
uh, Vicky?

1808
02:16:03,980 --> 02:16:06,120
but not Denzetsu Vicky.

1809
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:11,780
Vicky from fairly odd parents was there and I saw her on a
date.

1810
02:16:14,740 --> 02:16:18,120
I don't know the last time I ever thought about that, lady.

1811
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:22,460
I've been collecting too many thermoses.

1812
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,020
No, never enough.

1813
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:28,220
Can I upgrade?

1814
02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:28,700
Yes.

1815
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:33,480
Okay, now all we have to do is upgrade Max and we'll have
that.

1816
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:35,060
All upgrades.

1817
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,140
Clean up all leaves.

1818
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:40,560
Wait, I haven't found a mysterious photo here.

1819
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:45,160
A photo.

1820
02:16:53,450 --> 02:16:55,070
Kingdom Hearts must have been a dream.

1821
02:16:55,330 --> 02:16:57,210
Oh, I got one with that on their own.

1822
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:05,100
I liked Vicky when I was a kid.

1823
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:07,420
She's, like, evil, though, no?

1824
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:12,300
You have a tie?

1825
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:16,000
Do you ever think about, like, the characters that you
had...

1826
02:17:16,060 --> 02:17:24,120
crushes on as a kid and think about how like they influence
you like to have a type in the modern day like you know who

Oh, yeah.

1834
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:42,160
Who's like a big, like, character that Japanese kids had a
crush on, I wonder?

1835
02:18:43,100 --> 02:18:44,400
Like Shin-chan's mom.

1836
02:18:54,790 --> 02:18:56,090
Does anybody have...

1837
02:18:56,090 --> 02:18:57,970
Did anyone have a crush on Marge Simpson?

1838
02:18:59,810 --> 02:19:02,110
I guess that's the equivalent of having a crush.

1839
02:19:02,130 --> 02:19:09,350
crush on oh my god i thought the scarecrow was a person it's
the equivalent of having a crush on shin chan's mom where is

1846
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:30,920
yes yes yes but a lot of people had crushes on Misty lean
the inverse some whoa whoa She was very cute too.

1847
02:20:31,100 --> 02:20:31,760
I don't blame you.

1848
02:20:40,780 --> 02:20:41,600
Guys, we're so close.

1849
02:20:43,180 --> 02:20:44,500
We're so stinking close.

1850
02:20:45,960 --> 02:20:46,780
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1851
02:20:48,180 --> 02:20:48,540
Oh.

1852
02:20:51,180 --> 02:20:53,520
Wait, what am I gonna do with all this money now?

1853
02:20:55,260 --> 02:20:57,300
I'm rich and I have nowhere to do it.

1854
02:20:57,400 --> 02:20:58,220
No way to use it.

1855
02:20:58,380 --> 02:20:59,720
Wait, can I go into the secret room?

1856
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:02,520
Or do I have to unlock it?

1857
02:21:04,540 --> 02:21:04,900
Okay.

1858
02:21:05,800 --> 02:21:08,080
Kagome from Inuyasha is still goaded.

1859
02:21:09,100 --> 02:21:10,420
Now, were you guys a Kagome?

1860
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:13,260
Or were you a Kikyo?

1861
02:21:14,340 --> 02:21:16,420
In terms of looks, I preferred Kikyo.

1862
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:19,560
In terms of everything else, I preferred Kagome.

1863
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:24,480
Sango?

1864
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:26,140
Oh my gosh, Sango is...

1865
02:21:26,140 --> 02:21:27,140
Yeah, you're right.

1866
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:28,060
You're so right.

1867
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:33,760
Sango.

1868
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:36,760
Shoo.

1869
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:38,720
I'm just Moroku, I think.

1870
02:21:39,860 --> 02:21:41,680
I think I'm that guy.

1871
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:45,500
Okay, making sure there's no more leaves under there.

1872
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:47,540
I'm just going to pick these up with my hands.

1873
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:50,280
I'm speedrunning this, you guys.

1874
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:52,280
I'm going like fast as lightning.

1875
02:21:53,160 --> 02:21:55,660
Well, speedrun is maybe as I pick up one leaf at a time.

1876
02:21:56,140 --> 02:21:59,740
Maybe not correct, but I'm going to...

1877
02:21:59,740 --> 02:22:00,880
I'm going fast.

1878
02:22:10,590 --> 02:22:12,770
Bubbles for Powerpuff Girls.

1879
02:22:14,250 --> 02:22:21,950
Did anyone develop any fetishes because, or realize they had
a fetish because of, um, totally spies?

1880
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:45,480
Something's been happening here.

1881
02:22:46,660 --> 02:22:47,160
Wait!

1882
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:50,520
I'm looking for the secret.

1883
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:55,540
For the cards, though.

1884
02:22:57,500 --> 02:22:59,380
I'm looking up in the trees.

1885
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:02,040
up in the leaves

1886
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:21,310
because I don't think I don't think we got the cards for
everything never got a chance to watch totally spies there's

1887
02:23:21,310 --> 02:23:32,310

1893
02:24:08,850 --> 02:24:10,850
She would never know how much I loved her.

1894
02:24:13,130 --> 02:24:14,090
She's Burger Paladin.

1895
02:24:14,850 --> 02:24:15,670
I did that too.

1896
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:17,170
But with Inuyasha.

1897
02:24:21,950 --> 02:24:22,870
I would...

1898
02:24:22,870 --> 02:24:25,870
I had this small little hill in my backyard.

1899
02:24:26,030 --> 02:24:27,450
And I would go out at night.

1900
02:24:27,610 --> 02:24:29,710
Or like at sunset around that time.

1901
02:24:29,750 --> 02:24:30,990
And I would like lay on it.

1902
02:24:31,110 --> 02:24:32,550
And I would look up at the sky.

1903
02:24:32,610 --> 02:24:33,410
And I would be like.

1904
02:24:33,730 --> 02:24:35,610

1905
02:24:40,730 --> 02:24:52,430

Oh.

1910
02:25:11,750 --> 02:25:13,250
It's the point of no return.

1911
02:25:15,230 --> 02:25:15,670
Uh-oh.

1912
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:24,500

1913
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:26,940
Where are they?

1914
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:30,720
Why is it so smoky?

1915
02:25:30,780 --> 02:25:31,900
My house is on fire.

1916
02:25:46,250 --> 02:25:47,190
I'm trapped?

1917
02:25:47,610 --> 02:25:48,430
Wait, what the hell?

1918
02:25:49,050 --> 02:25:49,930
What is going on?

1919
02:25:50,190 --> 02:25:50,330

02:26:54,680 --> 02:26:55,960
