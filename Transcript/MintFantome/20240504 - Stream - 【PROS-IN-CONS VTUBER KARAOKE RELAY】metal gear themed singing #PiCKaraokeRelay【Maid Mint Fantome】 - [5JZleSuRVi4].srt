1
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,910
My name is Mithvetov!

2
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,410
I'm really sweaty!

3
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,490
And I really love Metal Gear!

4
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,770
So, listen to me sing Metal Gear songs!

5
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,610
Woohoo!

6
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,470
Petals of white cover fields, flowing in grieving tears.

7
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:59,410
And all the hearts, once new, old and shattered now.

8
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:06,450
Love can kill, love will die, give me wings to fly.

9
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:14,410
Fleeing this world so cold, I just wonder why.

10
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,730
Dramatic zoom!

11
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:25,170
Cold as the dark, now my words are frosted with every breath.

12
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:33,250
Still the hate burns wild, growing inside this heart.

13
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:39,810
When the wind changes course, when the stars align.

14
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:47,290
I will reach out to you, and leave this all behind.

15
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,430
When heavens divide.

16
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,350
I'm...

17
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:54,910
Um...

18
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,190
I don't know what else to say.

19
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,350
I'm really nervous.

20
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,550
Um...

21
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,970
Uh...

22
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,370
Metal...

23
00:02:59,370 --> 00:02:59,970
Metal Gear?

24
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,670
Um...

25
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,190
I really...

26
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,490
Uh...

27
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,330
Thank you guys!

28
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,070
I hope you guys have been enjoying the karaoke relay so far!

29
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,530
Everybody sounded great!

30
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,410
Um...

31
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,150
Uh...

32
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,910
And...

33
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,830
I hope you...

34
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,730
There's still lots of people left!

35
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,130
So...

36
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,730
Have lots of fun today!

37
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,410
Woohoo!

38
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,250
When heavens divide.

39
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,210
I will see.

40
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,330
The choices within me.

41
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,710
In my hands.

42
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,570
How can we ever protect?

43
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,050
And fight with our tiny souls?

44
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,630
Let me shine.

45
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,370
Like the sun.

46
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,070
Through the doubts and fear.

47
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,650
Do you feel the storm approach?

48
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,110
As the end draws near.

49
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,250
When heavens divide.

50
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,450
Time will come.

51
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,170
To softly lay.

52
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,590
Me down.

53
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,370
Then I can see a face.

54
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,590
That I long to see.

55
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,450
And for you.

56
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,590
Only you I would give anything.

57
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,330
Leaving a trace.

58
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,630
For love to find a way.

59
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,350
When heavens divide.

60
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,150
Time will come.

61
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:35,290
I'm gonna have to speed run through these songs, so I won't have much time to talk, but I'm a yapper!

62
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,430
Let's go!

63
00:04:37,650 --> 00:05:10,550
I will dive into the fire Spilling the blood of my desire The very last time My name scorched into the sky When heavens divide I will see the choices within my hands How can we ever protect and fight with our tiny souls?

64
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:25,610
Let me shine Like the sun Through the doubts and fear Do you feel the storm approach As the end draws near?

65
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:59,630
When heavens divide Time will come to softly lay me down Then I can see a face That I long to see And for you Only you I would give anything Leaving a trace For love to find a way When heavens divide Anything

66
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:25,730
Leaving a trace For love to find a way

67
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,110
When heaven's divine...

68
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,950
Hold on.

69
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,070
I have to transition.

70
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:42,930
One second.

71
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,990
Give me a second.

72
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,830
Give me a second.

73
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,230
Oh my gosh.

74
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:45,450
Wait.

75
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,490
All my stuff is all over the place.

76
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:46,930
Hold on.

77
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,270
Hold on.

78
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:47,530
Hold on.

79
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,330
Hold on.

80
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:48,410
Hold on.

81
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:48,610
Oh my gosh.

82
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,030
Go away.

83
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:49,630
Go to this.

84
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,570
Hold on.

85
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:51,990
One second.

86
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,430
One second.

87
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:53,990
Okay.

88
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,290
Okay.

89
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:54,530
Okay.

90
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,550
I'm going to sing the next song.

91
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,730
I'm nervous.

92
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,450
Where is my next song?

93
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,030
Oh, here it is.

94
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,550
Okay.

95
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,330
Oh gosh.

96
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,230
This song is so hard.

97
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,930
I'm so nervous.

98
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,350
Oh my gosh.

99
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:08,490
Okay.

100
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,770
Blind in the deepest night.

101
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:21,010
Reaching out, grasping for fleeting memory.

102
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,070
All these thoughts.

103
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,510
Keep piercing this broken mind.

104
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,650
I fall.

105
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,150
But I'm still standing.

106
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,710
Motionless.

107
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,170
Far.

108
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,190
In the distance.

109
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,090
There is light.

110
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,610
A light that burns these scars of old.

111
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,090
All this pain.

112
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,690
Reminds me of what I am.

113
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,990
I'll live.

114
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,490
I'll become all I need to be.

115
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,050
Whoa.

116
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,320
Whoa.

117
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,080
Whoa.

118
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,160
Whoa.

119
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,020
Whoa.

120
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,150
Whoa.

121
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,330
Whoa.

122
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:35,910
Whoa.

123
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,480
Whoa.

124
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,180
Words that kill.

125
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,000
Except I'm not.

126
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,980
I'm actually a ghost.

127
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,660
It's so funny.

128
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,460
But I never die, because I'm a ghost.

129
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,320
I mean, I'm already dead.

130
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,680
It's like undead, but not really undead, because I'm not a zombie, I'm a ghost.

131
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,340
What do I really count as?

132
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,620
Where do I fall under?

133
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,600
I'm having an existential crisis in the middle of this song, oh my gosh.

134
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,560
Anyway, okay.

135
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,980
Let's just keep going, right?

136
00:09:51,280 --> 00:10:18,660
Pride feeds their blackened hearts And the thirst must be quenched to fuel hypocrisy Cleansing flames is the only way to repent Renounce what made you words that kill Would you speak them to me?

137
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:27,320
With your breath so still It makes me believe This part is so hard.

138
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:45,960
The sins never die Can't wash this blood off our hands Let the world fear us all It's just means to an end Our salvation lies

139
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:56,040
Beyond the truth Let me suffer now

140
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:13,560
In my heart I just know that there's no way to light up the dark In his eyes

141
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,930
The next song, I've never sung before on stream, so I'm very nervous about it.

142
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:18,470
I'm nervous about all these, but anyway, I'm going to try and sync it to the best ability that I can.

143
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,790
Here we go.

144
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,350
Oh, where's my song?

145
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:23,630
There it is.

146
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,220
Here it is.

147
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,920
Here it is.

148
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:08,080
A little pause... and we are back.

149
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:28,480
A little pause... and we are back.

150
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:10,240
A little pause... and we are back.

151
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:42,350
A little pause...

152
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,000
and we are back.

153
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:22,100
A little pause...

154
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,100
and we are back.

155
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,580
A little

156
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:55,480
pause...

157
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:55,480
and we are back.

158
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,150
Okay, one more song!

159
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,310
One more song left and then I'll transfer you over to the next person.

160
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:26,330
If you don't know anything about Metal Gear, I hope that you still enjoyed the songs.

161
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,470
It's a great series, I really promise you.

162
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,650
Can I please spread the good word of Metal Gear, right?

163
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:45,370
Anyway, my last song may be a song that, maybe even if you don't know Metal Gear, you might know this one because it is the Metal Gear song, perhaps.

164
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,910
But yeah, my final song and then I'll pass you over.

165
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,850
Thank you guys for listening and...

166
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,850
Oh my gosh, hold on.

167
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,870
Let me get it up.

168
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,330
Let me get it ready.

169
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,330
What

170
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:52,730
a thrill With darkness and silence through the night What a thrill I'm searching and I'll melt into you What a fear in my heart But you're so supreme I give my life Not for honor, but for you Saiki da!

171
00:18:53,550 --> 00:19:00,870
In my time There'll be no one else

172
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:22,270
It's the way I fly to you I'm still in a dream Snake it up

173
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,030
Someday you go through the rain

174
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,570
A little pause... and we are back.

175
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:55,810
A little pause... and

176
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,390
we are back.

177
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,170
There'll be no one else...

178
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,170
Oh my god, my voice is cracking.

179
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:17,270
Crime is the way I fly to you.

180
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:27,510
I'm still in a dream, Snake Eater.

181
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,820
This is the outro.

182
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,080
I forgot.

183
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,520
I was like, yes, this is the outro.

184
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,000
I was like, wait.

185
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Thank you guys!

186
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,160
Thank you!

187
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,460
Thank you!

188
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,920
Have fun with the rest of the karaoke.

189
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,820
And I'll see you guys later.

190
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,320
Bye bye!

191
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,020
Bye bye!

192
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,390
What if we just have this playing as the outro instead?

193
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,530
Nana, bub,

194
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,640
it's time to redirect.

195
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:23,920
Nana, bub, it's time to redirect.

196
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,260
Perfect.

197
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,920
Oh, it's gone.

198
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,840
Okay, never mind.

199
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,280
You know what?

200
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,640
Bye!
