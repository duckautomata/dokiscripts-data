1
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,740
The game is gone!

2
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,440
One second.

3
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,120
Where'd it go?

4
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,670
Oh!

5
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,650
There it is.

6
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,750
Wait.

7
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,550
One second.

8
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,810
There we go.

9
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,170
Okaerina saimase!

10
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,010
Kusutin-sama!

11
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,630
Ocho-sama!

12
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,230
And lawnmower Nancy Drew-sama!

13
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,750
Hello, everybody.

14
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,290
Howdy.

15
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,130
Howdy doody.

16
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,210
Welcome in.

17
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,170
Welcome back to Nancy Drew!

18
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,950
Nancy Drew.

19
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,650
Speedy Fire!

20
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,790
Thank you so much for the vibe.

21
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,930
Thank you!

22
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,490
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

23
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,610
Found out about you through the Nancy Drew game fan community.

24
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:23,770
Uh-oh.

25
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,970
Did they know I'm playing this?

26
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,950
I didn't... wait.

27
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,310
Wow.

28
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,490
Oh, thank you!

29
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,210
Thanks for dropping by!

30
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,130
Thank you, thank you.

31
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,790
There's a community.

32
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,590
They're talking about me.

33
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,310
Scary.

34
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,130
Scary.

35
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:44,710
Wow!

36
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,210
Thank you!

37
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,430
Work is ultra crazy today.

38
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,450
Listening to the game has been really helping me get through.

39
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,110
Thank you so much.

40
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,470
I'm glad you liked the cover.

41
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,150
Did you guys listen to the cover?

42
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,070
Did you guys?

43
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,050
I just shared your first stream on our Nancy Drew.

44
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,010
Well...

45
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:05,710
Thank you!

46
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,830
Thank you very much!

47
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,870
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

48
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,850
Yeah, if you didn't know, I put out a cover...

49
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,650
Two days ago.

50
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,790
Oh, can't say goodbye to yesterday from Metal Gear Solid 2.

51
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,750
And even if you're like, I'm not a fan of Metal Gear or Metal Gear Solid 2.

52
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,490
I still think you should listen to it because I think it's a pretty song.

53
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,650
And you don't have to know anything about Metal Gear Solid 2 to know anything about it too!

54
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,650
True crew!

55
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,390
Thank you, Foxeye for the super job!

56
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,030
Thank you!

57
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,410
Trillions must listen to the cover.

58
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,670
I don't know, it's one of those songs that was more like a...

59
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:54,970
Hot dog!

60
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,010
Hot dad!

61
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,390
No, not like that.

62
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,370
More like a... it was like a...

63
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,650
It's like a passion thing for me, you know?

64
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,570
Rather than like a...

65
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,490
Oh, I hope this gets lots and lots of views.

66
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,370
But also, I hope it gets lots and lots of views.

67
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,990
Because, you know, if maybe ever a certain company is like...

68
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,730
Man, do we want to work with VTubers?

69
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,690
For promotion of a certain...

70
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:20,490
Um...

71
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,510
Bleddle...

72
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,830
Bler...

73
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,710
Blawlet game?

74
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,510
Then...

75
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,970
They might be like...

76
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,610
Oh, wow!

77
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,490
She has...

78
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,990
She has so many views!

79
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,410
So...

80
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,490
Also...

81
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,990
I did that whole song in one take.

82
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,290
So...

83
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:45,450
So...

84
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:45,810
Yeah!

85
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,150
I...

86
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,750
I...

87
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,850
I did it all!

88
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,770
There were so many Super Chats.

89
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,050
Hold on.

90
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,910
I have to like exit out of the game...

91
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,950
To be able to read them.

92
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,230
Um...

93
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,750
So...

94
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,070
It's...

95
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,930
If I miss your Super Chats today...

96
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,610
I'm very sorry.

97
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,190
Because otherwise...

98
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,930
I can't...

99
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,770
I have to like exit out of the game...

100
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,470
To scroll up...

101
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,050
To read them.

102
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,070
Thank you for bringing a Meow Tower.

103
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:10,890
Oh, yeah!

104
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,810
I love Meow...

105
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,590
Meow Tower!

106
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,870
I finally finished all my little cats rooms.

107
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,110
Now I'm just playing for fun...

108
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,390
And collecting tuna cans.

109
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,690
Thanks to our girl!

110
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,190
Cody, thank you!

111
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,870
Is Nancy Drew trying to find you?

112
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,510
Is this a Minto ghost mystery?

113
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,450
Hmm...

114
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,710
Oh, she's trying to find...

115
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,750
I'm scarier than this ghost, obviously.

116
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,750
Thank you, Spike!

117
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,750
BabyCore, thank you for the five gifted!

118
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,350
Jessie, thank you for the five gifted!

119
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

120
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,670
My Minto, it's my birthday.

121
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,370
Can I get a happy birthday?

122
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,550
Kaya Moon, happy birthday!

123
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,430
Happy birthday!

124
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,050
Alright.

125
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,670
I think I'm all cut out.

126
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,550
I'm also obsessed with Meow Tower.

127
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,190
Thanks to you.

128
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,630
I know, it's really...

129
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,650
It's such like a good...

130
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,790
Idol game.

131
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,630
Like, just to be...

132
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,200
Good evening, Fred!

133
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,280
Oh, you saw the Koyo!

134
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,200
I forgot to retweet it earlier.

135
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,100
I will do it after stream.

136
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,340
I have so many things to tweet.

137
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,320
But I kind of like to try and space things out.

138
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,900
I got a tweet about the mug.

139
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,740
I got a tweet about Koyo.

140
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,300
Hmm.

141
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,860
But then I also got busy today because I was like...

142
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,580
I was...

143
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,540
Working on stuff.

144
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,880
Ducky, thanks for the gifted!

145
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,560
Koyo.

146
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,600
Yeah, Koyo from Kimono Friends.

147
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,700
She asked if I wanted to...

148
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,660
Do a small little dance cover with her.

149
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,900
And...

150
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,260
I collabed with her.

151
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,600
I collabed with her...

152
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,920
A couple weeks ago now.

153
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,740
Hello, Nanograms.

154
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,340
Thank you for the app wreck.

155
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:56,940
Of course!

156
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,120
Um...

157
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,520
She's so small!

158
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,920
She's so small.

159
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,200
She was just like...

160
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,420
She was just like...

161
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,160
I...

162
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,720
I...

163
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,120
She was like, how tall are you?

164
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,400
And I was like, you know...

165
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,800
149.

166
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,060
She was like...

167
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,560
Oh...

168
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,900
Cause I guess she's...

169
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,960
You know, she's a coyote.

170
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,700
She doesn't know how tall she is.

171
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,720
Maybe.

172
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,140
She was like...

173
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,940
Staff said that I was this size with my ears.

174
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,160
But I don't think they're right.

175
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,760
I look so small next to you.

176
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,020
She...

177
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,140
She's itty bitty!

178
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,100
A little coyote!

179
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,100
I mean, coyotes are quite small.

180
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,120
Even for dogs, so...

181
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,020
But, um...

182
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,940
Yeah, we collabed a couple weeks ago.

183
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,040
But actually...

184
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,160
Koyo and I have known each other for...

185
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,120
Quite a while now, so...

186
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,360
Um...

187
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,000
We've been friends for...

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,840
Quite a long time.

189
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,500
Um...

190
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,600
Actually...

191
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,160
I'm more...

192
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,340
Well, to me...

193
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,160
I say we're friends, but to me, I'm a fan of her.

194
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,240
I've been a fan of her.

195
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,400
I think she's just the cutest stinking thing.

196
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,100
So...

197
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,940
Yeah, I'm glad that...

198
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,520
And she's graduating soon.

199
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,820
So I'm glad that we could dance together.

200
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,180
We've...

201
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,780
We've like...

202
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,240
We've gone to like...

203
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,240
Like, Matsuri together.

204
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,160
We've gone to karaoke together.

205
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,560
So...

206
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,180
You know.

207
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,040
Just bought your indirect kiss and mug.

208
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,660
Thank you!

209
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,980
Thank you!

210
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,280
Good to give you something to look forward to every morning.

211
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,660
Mwah mwah mwah!

212
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,700
Can't wait for the new...

213
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,560
Mousepad t-shirt.

214
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,380
Now new mug.

215
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:36,860
Wookiee!

216
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,320
Thank you!

217
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,940
Oh hi, Min!

218
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,860
Your new cover was so beautiful.

219
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
Makes me want to try the Metal Gear series now.

220
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,060
Metal Gear is very...

221
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,420
Emotional.

222
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,720
You have to prepare yourself.

223
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,640
Well...

224
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,100
Hmm...

225
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,220
So...

226
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,540
Last time on...

227
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,720
Nancy Drew San...

228
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,660
Chan...

229
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:56,880
What's the...

230
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,480
What do they call her?

231
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,640
Nancy Drew Chan or...

232
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,780
San?

233
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,320
I don't remember.

234
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
I think I remember.

235
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,200
Oh gosh.

236
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,740
Okay, so basically...

237
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,480
Nancy Drew goes to...

238
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,340
The Rio Con.

239
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:09,900
Um...

240
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,600
And they're just like...

241
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,360
It's not haunted.

242
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,160
And then she sees a ghost in the mirror.

243
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,980
And she's like...

244
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,000
Wah!

245
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,120
And then...

246
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,380
Um...

247
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,120
What was the guy's name?

248
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,520
Starts with an R.

249
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:21,880
Right?

250
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,620
Oh...

251
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,200
Uh...

252
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,960
Oh gosh.

253
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,940
I can't remember his name.

254
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,580
Rentaro!

255
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,520
Rentaro!

256
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, yeah.

257
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,100
Rentaro!

258
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,360
Yeah, Kojima!

259
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,440
Rentaro gives us...

260
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:38,900
Um...

261
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,020
Books of...

262
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,620
Sudoku.

263
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,420
We love that.

264
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,460
I also...

265
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:43,860
Can I?

266
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,280
Okay.

267
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,040
I don't think I can change my level.

268
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,000
I accidentally made the mistake of choosing Senior Detective.

269
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,560
Even though this is my first ever time playing Nancy Drew.

270
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:54,880
And...

271
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,270
Um...

272
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,310
We're about to do some really hard...

273
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,590
Uh...

274
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,570
Sudoku puzzle.

275
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:04,750
Because...

276
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,630
And I only know nanograms.

277
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,550
I don't know Sudoku.

278
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,030
I'm not very good with that.

279
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,430
We can help with the Sudoku?

280
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:10,810
Okay.

281
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,590
Yes, please!

282
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:13,690
Please!

283
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,350
Please...

284
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,490
Please help with Sudoku.

285
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,970
And because...

286
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,590
Uh...

287
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,910
There's this mechanical robot cat...

288
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,690
That is like...

289
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,570
Guarding the...

290
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,930
The table...

291
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,590
The desk...

292
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,790
The front desk...

293
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,290
That we need to...

294
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,050
Dis...

295
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:29,810
Disarm.

296
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,750
It's...

297
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,430
This game is so weird.

298
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,590
Oh, thank you so much for the raid!

299
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,030
Hello!

300
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:36,390
Hello!

301
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,810
We're just getting started, so...

302
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:40,850
Hmm...

303
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,890
Yeah, Suki.

304
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,330
Suki.

305
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,870
Suki was the cat.

306
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,770
So let's, um...

307
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,890
I think it's this one.

308
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,630
I'm almost positive.

309
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

310
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:48,870
So load.

311
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,390
So...

312
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,350
We just got back to the Ryokan.

313
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:55,650
And...

314
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,010
This lady...

315
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,430
I feel like I'm giving the worst ever summary.

316
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:01,970
There's...

317
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,090
Okay.

318
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,350
There's two sisters.

319
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,730
Her...

320
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,070
And then...

321
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,350
The other girl...

322
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,710
Who works at like a bento shop.

323
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,470
And...

324
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,290
The...

325
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,110
Their mom passed away.

326
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,950
But we don't know why.

327
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,110
Alvin!

328
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,570
Thank you so much for the five gifts.

329
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,210
Thank you!

330
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,550
And...

331
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,790
They...

332
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,810
Are...

333
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,550
We are trying to figure out why the Ryokan is haunted.

334
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,730
The bento sister is the cool one.

335
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,890
Yeah.

336
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,130
Cool one.

337
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,410
Oh my god!

338
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,690
I forgot I had...

339
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,090
Cowboy Joe...

340
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,370
As my background.

341
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,190
Um...

342
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,470
Okay.

343
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,770
So we just got...

344
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,330
Hold on.

345
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,110
We just got...

346
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,990
The Sudoku book.

347
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,890
And we have to complete it.

348
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:50,910
Sudoku.

349
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,670
Okay.

350
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,110
Oh my god.

351
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,450
Oh wait!

352
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,850
You only do one at a time!

353
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,170
Oh that's not bad.

354
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:58,950
Okay.

355
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:01,890
So...

356
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,410
This can't be nine.

357
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,980
Oh gosh.

358
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,480
How are you supposed to figure this out?

359
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,480
I'm gonna put like...

360
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,000
Can I just put random for now?

361
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,240
How do you do this?

362
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,560
Like how do you do like a...

363
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,840
Like a placeholder?

364
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,560
I...

365
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,260
I don't know.

366
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,520
Like...

367
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,080
I...

368
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,720
I don't even know what the strat is.

369
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,460
Like I know...

370
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,640
I know what you're supposed to do for Sudoku but...

371
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,500
I don't know what like the strat is.

372
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,220
Made it in time for puzzles.

373
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,080
Oh yeah baby!

374
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,620
Usually you can put in all the possible numbers then cross them out.

375
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,480
Okay, okay, okay.

376
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,580
So...

377
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,140
This can't be four.

378
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,740
It can't be five.

379
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,740
It can't be seven.

380
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,380
It can't be eight.

381
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,400
It could be nine.

382
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,430
So happy you're continuing this Nancy Drew game.

383
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,530
I really hope you enjoy the rest of it.

384
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,330
Thank you Chip!

385
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,230
Thank you.

386
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,410
So now we need a one...

387
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,430
One...

388
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,050
Four...

389
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,690
Five...

390
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,270
Nine.

391
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,010
One...

392
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,330
Four...

393
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:21,670
Five...

394
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,810
Nine.

395
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,310
Let's put nine...

396
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,810
Oh, wait no.

397
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:26,270
Just kidding.

398
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,650
Wait.

399
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,450
One...

400
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:28,950
Four...

401
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,270
Five...

402
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,550
One...

403
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:29,730
Four...

404
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:29,870
Five.

405
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,550
Try solving the left column first.

406
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,270
It's the easiest.

407
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:35,770
Oh...

408
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,230
Okay, okay.

409
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,270
So...

410
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,090
It could either be three...

411
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,410
Or...

412
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,330
Five...

413
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:41,850
Or...

414
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:41,990
Nine.

415
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,910
Three...

416
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,230
Five...

417
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,390
Nine.

418
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:44,410
Nine.

419
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,770
Three...

420
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:44,990
Five...

421
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,190
Nine.

422
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,530
So this is not nine.

423
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,970
So it's three or five.

424
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,770
This is not nine.

425
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,850
So nine is up here.

426
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,230
And...

427
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,030
Uh...

428
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,770
Wait.

429
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,230
What was it?

430
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:01,910
Three...

431
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,410
Or...

432
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:02,610
Five?

433
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,730
Could be either one.

434
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,950
Three can only be at the top or bottom.

435
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,210
Why?

436
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:12,850
Why?

437
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,130
Why?

438
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:14,150
Why?

439
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,810
The middle one can't be three?

440
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:16,850
This one?

441
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,470
Why not?

442
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,750
Three can't be in the same box.

443
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,290
Wait.

444
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:24,770
What do you mean?

445
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:25,710
Hmm?

446
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,270
There's a three in the box.

447
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,640
Where do you see that?

448
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,200
There's already a three.

449
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,340
Where do you see that?

450
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,380
Huh?

451
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,480
What?

452
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,580
What?

453
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,560
Oh, it's by box?

454
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,540
Oh my god!

455
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,960
Oh!

456
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,460
Oh, so it's by the...

457
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:51,920
Ow!

458
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,760
What do you mean bent?

459
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,520
I told you.

460
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,420
I don't know the...

461
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,260
How...

462
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,440
I don't place a doku.

463
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,520
Okay.

464
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,880
So then three is down here.

465
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,510
Okay.

466
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,890
Okay.

467
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:06,190
Okay.

468
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:06,430
Okay.

469
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,570
Okay.

470
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,750
It's both?

471
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,110
Okay.

472
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,610
Okay.

473
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:10,850
Okay.

474
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:10,950
Okay.

475
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,190
I guess that makes it a little easier though, right?

476
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,850
Cause you can kind of isolate it.

477
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:16,810
Okay.

478
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,550
Hmm.

479
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,430
I...

480
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,110
Uh...

481
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,370
Uh...

482
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,710
Uh...

483
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,270
I'm confused.

484
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,630
What if I just put random...

485
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,670
You know?

486
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,370
Let's see.

487
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,410
This could be...

488
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,770
One, two, three...

489
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,430
Or...

490
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,610
Eight, one...

491
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,730
Five.

492
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,090
Eight, one, or five.

493
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,110
Eight...

494
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,230
Can't be eight here.

495
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,690
Can't be one here.

496
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,670
So maybe...

497
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,790
So eight would be here...

498
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,250
Or here.

499
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:01,630
Uh...

500
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:02,970
Uh...

501
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,190
I'm just gonna do...

502
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,210
Like this.

503
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,250
I feel like I'm already messing it up.

504
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,390
You're getting it.

505
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:13,950
I'm not.

506
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,670
You guys, this is also...

507
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,110
Look at this.

508
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,290
This is how many we have to solve.

509
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,570
Maybe I should just...

510
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,570
Maybe I should just have you guys solve all of them for me.

511
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,570
Ha ha ha ha.

512
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,070
Ha ha ha ha ha.

513
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,590
Ha ha ha ha.

514
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,810
Oh god.

515
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,510
We're gonna be here forever!

516
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,530
Ha ha ha ha.

517
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:38,860
Ha ha ha ha.

518
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,620
Uh...

519
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,280
What if I just brute force it?

520
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,410
You assume we know.

521
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,090
You have to solve them?

522
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,090
Yes, this one we actually 100% have to solve.

523
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,150
Because it's to continue the story.

524
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,730
To be able to know how to...

525
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,190
We have to solve these so that the guy...

526
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,370
Here, hold on, I'll show you guys.

527
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,010
Wait, how do I... Get me out of here.

528
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,790
Get me out, get me out.

529
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,850
So, there's this cat here.

530
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,130
Uh, not there.

531
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,670
Hi.

532
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,030
Oh my god.

533
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,630
This cat...

534
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,930
We have to...

535
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,930
We have to be able to...

536
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,070
Disarm it, but we don't know how.

537
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,150
Hi.

538
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,070
I'll stop bugging you now.

539
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,110
Okay, see ya.

540
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:33,770
Bye-bye.

541
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,510
Hi.

542
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,410
Nani ga suki?

543
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,310
Choco Minto!

544
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,170
Yorimba-a-nata!

545
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,910
Oh, I'm spinning, I'm spinning.

546
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,770
Oh yeah, sorry.

547
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,790
Okay, getting dizzy.

548
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,510
Getting dizzy.

549
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,950
Alright.

550
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,030
Alright.

551
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,070
No, no, no.

552
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,250
There we go.

553
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:51,570
Okay.

554
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,950
Back to Sudoku.

555
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,210
We have to do this.

556
00:19:59,450 --> 00:19:59,890
Okay.

557
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,070
Oh, golly.

558
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,310
Guys, I have no faith.

559
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,970
Why couldn't it be Nonograms?

560
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,250
Why couldn't it be Nonograms?

561
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,410
Why couldn't it be Nonograms?

562
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:09,850
Why couldn't it be Nonograms?

563
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,650
Why do you hate to skip?

564
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,350
I like to do all the same numbers together as a first step.

565
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,430
For example, you solve all ones with the current numbers.

566
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,190
Hmm?

567
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,370
Second column from the right is the new easy.

568
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,110
Yeah.

569
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,330
Well...

570
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,030
Easy.

571
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,730
Wait, so this one's gotta be six.

572
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,650
So one, two, and then three.

573
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,690
Four, five, six.

574
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,610
I wonder...

575
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,430
Hold on, let me see if it'll let us mess up.

576
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:42,990
Oh, it will!

577
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,950
Oh, that's messed up.

578
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,450
That's messed up that they'll let us mess...

579
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,210
They'll let us, like, they won't be like...

580
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,270
Come on, Nancy.

581
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,990
That's where you come in and be like...

582
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,670
I don't know about that.

583
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,570
Father Pickles, happy birthday!

584
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,050
Sorry, I'm not doing birthday songs for a little while.

585
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:01,990
Because of my throat.

586
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,850
But I can wish you a happy, happy birthday!

587
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:07,690
Her boy!

588
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:08,970
Welcome to membership.

589
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:09,510
Thank you!

590
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:10,810
Alright.

591
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,670
Maybe on a lower difficulty, she does...

592
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:17,990
Maybe.

593
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,410
Maybe...

594
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:24,970
Okay.

595
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,030
This can't be one or two.

596
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,910
It might be three.

597
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,990
And this can't be...

598
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,450
Well, obviously it can't be two.

599
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,030
This can't be one.

600
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,430
Oh, gosh.

601
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,530
Five, three, two at top row.

602
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,090
Sy, I'm listening to you!

603
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,810
Five, three, two.

604
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,810
If I'm getting one guide...

605
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,290
So be it.

606
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,190
So be it.

607
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,590
So...

608
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,430
Oh, it can't be three!

609
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:01,990
You're right!

610
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,810
So it must be...

611
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,550
Two!

612
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,190
Yeah!

613
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,370
Yeah!

614
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,690
And then this must be three.

615
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,300
It can't be two!

616
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:21,880
Here?

617
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,520
What are you talking about?

618
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,580
Oh, you're right.

619
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,720
I saw.

620
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,920
Oh, no.

621
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,260
Oh, guys, I already...

622
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:29,700
Oh, no!

623
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,680
Um...

624
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,240
Where did I put the...

625
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,040
Last one?

626
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:37,740
Wait.

627
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,900
Did I put three?

628
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,100
Many people know Nancy Drew, but have you heard of her lesser known twin, Nancy Erased?

629
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,920
Second row is four, five, one.

630
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,120
Second row is four, five, one.

631
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,360
Thank you.

632
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,240
This is to continue the story, everybody.

633
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,290
I play nanograms.

634
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,800
I don't play Sudoku.

635
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,400
We must all be good in our one talent.

636
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,490
Wait, then two would be here.

637
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,220
But then I don't have a place to put one.

638
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,820
So I already messed up.

639
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,870
So I already messed up.

640
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,330
So I already messed up.

641
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,670
The column has a mistake.

642
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,650
Yeah, clearly.

643
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,500
One, six, five are incorrect in top right.

644
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,510
I'm literally scratching my head right now like a monkey.

645
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,900
Like that?

646
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,820
Wait, no.

647
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,480
Oh!

648
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,580
I don't want to play this anymore.

649
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,780
I don't want to play this anymore.

650
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,540
I don't like Sudoku.

651
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,260
I don't like Sudoku!

652
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,400
I don't want to play this anymore.

653
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,780
Ugh!

654
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,600
Swap one and five.

655
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:30,960
Okay.

656
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,950
Wait, did I do that?

657
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:36,510
Wait.

658
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,970
Did I swap them?

659
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,250
Wait, did I swap them?

660
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,770
I can't remember what the order was.

661
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,830
Chatter was wrong.

662
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,210
Oh.

663
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:59,070
As someone who hates Sudoku and was given a book of them for Christmas and then had that whole book solved by afternoon.

664
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,570
Yeah, that's you.

665
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:02,790
I...

666
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,290
don't like numbers.

667
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,270
So...

668
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,500
I'm gonna look it up.

669
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,590
Tansu drew.

670
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,930
Shadow at the water's edge.

671
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:30,570
Walkthrough.

672
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:33,610
Okay.

673
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,960
Where do we get to the Sudoku?

674
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,860
This must be like super...

675
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,600
Oh!

676
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,020
Oh!

677
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:44,380
Oh!

678
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,320
My senior master's Sudoku.

679
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,060
Okay.

680
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,720
Three, two...

681
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
I got the first row right!

682
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,960
Actually, I'm just gonna erase them all.

683
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,740
Five.

684
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:58,940
Five.

685
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,520
Watch my...

686
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,180
This is a...

687
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,480
This is a speed run, everybody.

688
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,900
This is for everybody who wants to know how to solve this puzzle.

689
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,480
This is the most difficult puzzle in the game.

690
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,960
By my intuition.

691
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,960
By my spiritual prowess.

692
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,440
I can see...

693
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,360
I can see the future, the past.

694
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,600
I can see...

695
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,860
I can see...

696
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,760
Everything that is happening.

697
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,260
At...

698
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,480
Everything that has happened.

699
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Will happen.

700
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,040
Will never happen.

701
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,360
I am seeing it all.

702
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:42,380
I am having all the answers beamed directly into my mind.

703
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,420
I am being called upon.

704
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,780
By a higher plane.

705
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,280
That says here is what you must do.

706
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,560
Nancy Drew.

707
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,580
Whoa!

708
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,480
And then my hair flies off.

709
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,660
And then my underwear flies off.

710
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,360
And then all my body parts disintegrate.

711
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,180
I become nothing.

712
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,240
I become everything.

713
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,180
I become light.

714
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,200
I see everything.

715
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,840
I see.

716
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,550
And I feel all.

717
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,600
Every experience.

718
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,500
I've lived it.

719
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,040
I've died it.

720
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,300
Everything is happening to me.

721
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,020
At this very moment.

722
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,660
In Sudoku.

723
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,700
Nancy Drew.

724
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,560
Nancy Drew.

725
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,820
What happened to you?

726
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,800
How did you become like this?

727
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,540
Nancy Drew.

728
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,920
How did you become so you?

729
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,900
Nancy Drew.

730
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,440
You are so powerful.

731
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:52,820
Oops.

732
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,600
And you can see all.

733
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,600
And you never make a mistake.

734
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,600
Nancy Drew.

735
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,000
We trust you.

736
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,840
Nancy Drew.

737
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,340
You are all that is real and true.

738
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,340
Nancy Drew.

739
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,560
Nancy Drew.

740
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,980
We believe in you.

741
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,060
Nancy Drew never has ever done anything bad.

742
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,460
Or made a mistake in her life!

743
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:18,920
Ok.

744
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,350
Grub's bald head and tail starts squeaking.

745
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,170
Next one!

746
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,230
Oh no, you're right.

747
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,290
Guys, I don't usually cheat on puzzles.

748
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:58,830
Okay, I didn't go to math class in school.

749
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,490
And now, whenever I see numbers, I start to cry.

750
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,170
That's a true story.

751
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,460
Okay, so Nancy drew...

752
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:27,750
My Sudoku is different... than the walkthrough.

753
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,780
Okay, wait, I can do this one.

754
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,300
One, three, two, five... Oh, see, I've already solved some of it.

755
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,760
Six... Nope, that's an eight.

756
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,400
Sorry, I can't read numbers very well at all.

757
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,660
Please understand.

758
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,460
I like... I like nonograms because I make a picture.

759
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,080
This is just numbers and it stresses me out.

760
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,300
Four, nine.

761
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:04,720
Okay.

762
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:12,720
Uh, five, one, two, nine, four... I wish they give you the option to choose.

763
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,220
Like, do you want to do Sudoku or do you want to do nonogram?

764
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,960
Because why give you both books then?

765
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,640
If they... if it's... it feels like...

766
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,140
Oh yeah, I'm training you by giving you the nonogram or the Sudoku book.

767
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,380
Why give me both?

768
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,740
Why get my hopes up?

769
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,460
Hmm?

770
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,810
How do I know kanji?

771
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,750
Oh, I don't know kanji.

772
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,270
But also, I'm not gonna sit here and explain my trauma to you.

773
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,570
You, you, you, you, you, I don't need to explain to you.

774
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,150
Two, four, one.

775
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,270
Fair.

776
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,610
Can't wait for it to arrive.

777
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,550
Also, Minto, how are you with crosswords?

778
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,110
I'm not bad with... I don't know, actually.

779
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,230
I like crosswords.

780
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,330
Bought the cup.

781
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:13,990
Thank you!

782
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,070
Oh, someone asked about the initial, like, the original mugs.

783
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,290
Um...

784
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:24,890
It was in a member stream, but someone asked, like, Hey, Minto, when are we seeing the mugs?

785
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,490
Um...

786
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,290
And, uh, they should be...

787
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,830
Shipping out soon.

788
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:34,610
Um...

789
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,350
Because...

790
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,610
They, um...

791
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,810
They had a little bit of a...

792
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,410
A hiccup at the manufacturing.

793
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,130
But they should be...

794
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,190
I think it was, like, I was told this week, even.

795
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:47,710
So...

796
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,530
Um, those...

797
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,810
Should be on their way.

798
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,010
Soon!

799
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:57,630
Sorry!

800
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,970
I'm so stressed out.

801
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:05,970
Uh...

802
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:06,550
Okay.

803
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,590
Okay.

804
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,230
Okay.

805
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,750
What do I do with this one?

806
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,790
It's completely different.

807
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,510
Oh, no.

808
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,790
Okay, guys.

809
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,490
This one, we're gonna have to solve legitimately.

810
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:17,950
Okay?

811
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,710
This one...

812
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,470
The last one will solve legitimately.

813
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,910
But these ones will speed run through it.

814
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,990
So that we can continue the game.

815
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,630
I have no...

816
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,180
I have no...

817
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:32,710
Um...

818
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,950
Even a little bit of...

819
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,310
Uh...

820
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,690
Shame doing this at all.

821
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,010
Actually.

822
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:41,630
So...

823
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,790
Assuming this is gonna be a full three hours Sudoku stream?

824
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,290
Maybe.

825
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:46,330
Sorry.

826
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,430
Hmm...

827
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:51,830
Hmm...

828
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,550
Uh...

829
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:55,830
Hmm...

830
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,090
And you know what...

831
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:57,350
Oops!

832
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,430
If you're upset about...

833
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:58,730
I...

834
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,930
You guys saw how good I solved all those...

835
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,730
No-no grams last time!

836
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,090
And then I'm...

837
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:04,690
Put...

838
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,170
Being...

839
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:05,910
Put through this?

840
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:06,650
Oops!

841
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:08,570
This is...

842
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,710
This is so rude!

843
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,510
This is just rudeness!

844
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,450
Six...

845
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,610
Four...

846
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,490
Two...

847
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,170
I...

848
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:15,610
I have...

849
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,570
I'm capable of other things!

850
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,370
But not numbers!

851
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,310
Oh god!

852
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,270
It's the creepy music!

853
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,130
The song is especially creepy!

854
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,550
Six...

855
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,430
Four...

856
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:28,810
Three...

857
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,030
Seven...

858
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,810
The ghost is angry that I'm trading up again!

859
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,090
Ha ha ha ha ha!

860
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,690
Eight...

861
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,150
Eight...

862
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,510
Nine...

863
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,350
One...

864
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,470
I wonder how many...

865
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,330
Oh, it's the same.

866
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,350
Okay, never mind.

867
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,270
If I were to have been in the junior one, it would have been the same...

868
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:56,650
Uh...

869
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,970
The same number...

870
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,890
Of...

871
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,330
Sudoku to do...

872
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,330
This is so messed up!

873
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,170
Nancy Drew, I'll never forgive you!

874
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,550
I'll never forgive you for making me do Sudoku!

875
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,290
Ugh!

876
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:10,590
Ugh!

877
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:10,790
Ugh!

878
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:11,910
Okay.

879
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,330
I'm gonna stop complaining...

880
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:15,190
Soon.

881
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,890
Ha ha ha ha ha!

882
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:17,490
Okay.

883
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,190
Six...

884
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,530
Five...

885
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,490
Three...

886
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:20,810
Nine...

887
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,610
Eight...

888
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,110
One...

889
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,370
I can't even remember my own phone number, you guys!

890
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:32,370
I have to pretend that I just got a new phone number recently, and I'd be like, Oh sorry, it's a new phone number, I have to look it up!

891
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,510
Cause...

892
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,390
I...

893
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,870
I don't know it.

894
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,900
What is it?

895
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,780
Ha ha ha ha ha!

896
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,340
I can't tell you, I don't remember!

897
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,620
Ah ha ha ha!

898
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,420
Ha ha ha ha!

899
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:16,220
Would you like to look in your phone settings and click that about phone button and show me the 10 digits that are written there?

900
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,240
Does it play this creepy sort of ghost music everywhere or just at the ryokan?

901
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,600
At the ryokan, baby!

902
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,500
8, 7, 5, 9, 6.

903
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
We're doing it, guys!

904
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,720
We're doing it!

905
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,840
Oh, the numbers are coming to me at once!

906
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,800
Oh, why is 6 afraid of 7?

907
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,940
Why is 6 afraid of 7?

908
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,670
Why?

909
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,110
7, 8, 9!

910
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,770
7 is a cannibal.

911
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,610
And therefore...

912
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,970
It's terrifying.

913
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:22,610
7...

914
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,250
You would go to...

915
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,030
What was that place?

916
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:27,870
Um...

917
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,650
Okay!

918
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,430
Ah, what?

919
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:30,970
The place!

920
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:31,770
Oh my gosh!

921
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:39,310
The Ripley's, believe it or not, I went there once as a kid.

922
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,570
I went there once as a kid.

923
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,870
And...

924
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,250
And...

925
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,050
I...

926
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,870
It had me believing that Hannibal Lecter was real.

927
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,890
Because...

928
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,570
They're just like, this is Hannibal Lecter's...

929
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,230
Uh...

930
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,930
His...

931
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,430
It's his little mouth thing.

932
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,070
That...

933
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,250
That they used to cover his mouth.

934
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,650
So that he wouldn't eat people.

935
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,830
And I'm just like...

936
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:10,750
Wait, he...

937
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,450
Wait, he isn't?

938
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:12,930
He's real?

939
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,770
He's outside my window right now?

940
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,550
I see you chose the ordinary.

941
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,310
He's based on a real serial killer.

942
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,450
Yeah, but I remember at the...

943
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,910
At the place, they were just like, this is Hannibal Lecter's.

944
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,670
Maybe they meant from the movie?

945
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,590
Like...

946
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,170
This is the prop they used?

947
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,010
I don't know.

948
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,230
Mintoku.

949
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:38,650
But...

950
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,530
But...

951
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,910
I'm like...

952
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,770
You...

953
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:46,050
They're making me feel like he's a real person.

954
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,150
He's literally me.

955
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,970
Hannibal Lecter.

956
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,750
That's the not part.

957
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:58,590
That's the not part.

958
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,270
Maybe it was the actual prop.

959
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,150
But I really believed he was a real person for a long, long time.

960
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,590
Okay.

961
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,250
So I know this one is seven.

962
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,450
Because we have seven in here.

963
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,370
We have seven in here.

964
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:17,190
Okay.

965
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,730
And then...

966
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,850
How are you still in Sudoku?

967
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,590
Oh, I'm sorry.

968
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,550
Oh, I'm sorry.

969
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,820
Okay.

970
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,260
Bottom right is nine here?

971
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,840
How do you know?

972
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,420
How do you know?

973
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,680
Hold on.

974
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,300
Hold on.

975
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,360
There, we could have a two...

976
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,220
Wait, one...

977
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,180
Five, five, six...

978
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,940
Seven, eight...

979
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,060
This is nine or two.

980
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,180
Nine or two.

981
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,960
So this has to be nine, right?

982
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,940
And then this has to be two.

983
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,460
Wrong.

984
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,500
Bottom right is ten out of ten.

985
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,820
Where did you get your maid dress from?

986
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,820
Probably a fancy...

987
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,900
Boutique!

988
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,720
Thanks, Bill.

989
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,660
Okay.

990
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,880
And then...

991
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,380
So we need one...

992
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,460
Which can't be this one.

993
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,580
It might be this one.

994
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,680
And three...

995
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,120
And eight...

996
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,920
For this box.

997
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,660
This can't be eight.

998
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,400
And it could be three.

999
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,350
One has to go top left.

1000
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:01,730
It does?

1001
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,690
It has to?

1002
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,390
It's one.

1003
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:06,630
Okay.

1004
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,410
And so then eight...

1005
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,470
And then three.

1006
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:14,150
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1007
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:14,530
Okay.

1008
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:14,990
Okay.

1009
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,010
One box!

1010
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,170
There's a one in every row.

1011
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:19,930
Oh!

1012
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,510
I see it down here.

1013
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,270
Oh, I didn't notice.

1014
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,490
I was only looking at the...

1015
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,770
At the rows, not the column.

1016
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,050
Okay, okay, okay.

1017
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,470
Okay.

1018
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,890
And then this one.

1019
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,830
This can't be two.

1020
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,790
So two has to be here.

1021
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:39,650
And...

1022
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:40,750
Three...

1023
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,250
Four.

1024
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,250
Four.

1025
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,670
Three...

1026
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,370
Four.

1027
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,750
No!

1028
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,850
Wrong.

1029
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,050
Sorry.

1030
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,770
Four...

1031
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,270
Three.

1032
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,390
Sorry.

1033
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,130
Sorry.

1034
00:40:59,310 --> 00:40:59,790
I really...

1035
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,690
Okay, when you...

1036
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,810
When will you guys understand?

1037
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,710
Okay.

1038
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,240
Okay.

1039
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,360
So...

1040
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,820
This...

1041
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,100
These...

1042
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,240
Neither of these can be two.

1043
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,120
This...

1044
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,980
So I think...

1045
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,560
This one is three.

1046
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,040
Ugh.

1047
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,380
This one's three.

1048
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,340
Four.

1049
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:32,580
Four.

1050
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,780
And we have five...

1051
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,710
Can't be here.

1052
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:44,790
Can't be here.

1053
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,150
Can't be here.

1054
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:46,710
Five.

1055
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,050
One...

1056
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:50,410
Two...

1057
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:50,950
Three...

1058
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,770
Four...

1059
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,550
Five...

1060
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,830
Five...

1061
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,190
Six...

1062
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:54,530
Seven...

1063
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,330
This is nine.

1064
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:56,970
Okay.

1065
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:02,050
It helps when you have an already solved corner.

1066
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,010
Because you can just kind of like...

1067
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,990
You can just...

1068
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,670
Continue from there.

1069
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,090
Let's clear my name.

1070
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,390
My mom solved that...

1071
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:11,910
Sudoku book.

1072
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,730
Minto math class ones.

1073
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,130
You can't make me!

1074
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,770
You can't make me!

1075
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,370
I'll never go back!

1076
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,130
Oh...

1077
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,050
Okay, we have four.

1078
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:26,970
Maybe six?

1079
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,530
Wait, what are we missing here?

1080
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,410
Two...

1081
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:35,810
Two...

1082
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:37,830
Two...

1083
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:39,750
Nine...

1084
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,070
What else?

1085
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:47,510
Six!

1086
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:48,710
Two-nine-six!

1087
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,550
Two-nine...

1088
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,290
Two-six-nine.

1089
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,190
Two-six-nine.

1090
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,170
Okay, so this can't be nine.

1091
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,010
This can't be nine.

1092
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,250
So this has to be nine.

1093
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:00,450
Uh...

1094
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:01,490
And...

1095
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:02,730
Six...

1096
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:04,370
Uh...

1097
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:05,710
Uh...

1098
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:11,090
It could be either...

1099
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:12,690
Right now.

1100
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,270
It could be either right now.

1101
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:18,410
Uh...

1102
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:19,290
Okay, we'll come back.

1103
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,940
You're doing great for a first-ever Sudoku go-around.

1104
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:27,680
Thank you!

1105
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:30,840
Uh...

1106
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,020
Okay.

1107
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,360
Then...

1108
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,420
What else would be easy to solve?

1109
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:40,760
Hmm...

1110
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,720
Maybe we'll go down.

1111
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:42,940
I don't know.

1112
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:44,660
Uh...

1113
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,400
Three...

1114
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
Can't be three...

1115
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,200
This... Oh, we have three.

1116
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,820
We need one...

1117
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,460
So one would be here.

1118
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,800
Two...

1119
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,380
Three...

1120
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,640
Four...

1121
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,820
Can't be here.

1122
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,140
Can't be here.

1123
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,180
Can't be here.

1124
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,640
It has to be one of these two.

1125
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,480
Hmm...

1126
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,000
Five...

1127
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,440
Can't be this one.

1128
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,580
Can't be this one.

1129
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,960
The...

1130
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,820
I wish I could like put...

1131
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,320
I wish I could put like a...

1132
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,380
Maybe this.

1133
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,220
I wish I could put like a...

1134
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,140
Maybe it's this.

1135
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,100
Final ones or bottom row?

1136
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,260
Wait, what do you mean?

1137
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,060
Five top left.

1138
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,580
Do I have some paper?

1139
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,560
No, I don't.

1140
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,200
Top left must be five.

1141
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:37,840
Why?

1142
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:38,780
Must be.

1143
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,200
Oh, yes, you're right.

1144
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,800
Cause here...

1145
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,680
And here.

1146
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:43,520
Oh!

1147
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,260
Thank you.

1148
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,000
Okay.

1149
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,340
Mine bottom left.

1150
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:00,460
Wait, what?

1151
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,480
Bottom left?

1152
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:04,980
Huh?

1153
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:06,840
Huh?

1154
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,260
Huh?

1155
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:08,300
What?

1156
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,320
Huh?

1157
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,980
Six is possible.

1158
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,780
What do you mean six is possible to solve?

1159
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:15,360
Who's six?

1160
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,320
Where's six?

1161
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,040
What?

1162
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,780
You guys are going so fast.

1163
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:20,800
I'm confused.

1164
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,960
I can do eight now.

1165
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:23,460
What do you mean?

1166
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,460
I can do eight.

1167
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:25,380
Hold on.

1168
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,080
Hold on.

1169
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,240
What do you mean?

1170
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,660
I'm so confused.

1171
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,380
Stop it.

1172
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:32,980
Stop.

1173
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,900
I don't know what you're talking about.

1174
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,920
Like I can put eight here?

1175
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,780
Is that what you mean?

1176
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:56,310
Okay.

1177
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,130
Okay.

1178
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:57,910
Okay.

1179
00:45:58,770 --> 00:45:59,450
Okay.

1180
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:00,310
Okay.

1181
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:00,490
Okay.

1182
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:00,870
Okay.

1183
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:01,470
Uh...

1184
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,070
No, two.

1185
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,610
Um, hold on.

1186
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,230
Uh, we need four.

1187
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,690
Four.

1188
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:08,890
Uh...

1189
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:09,650
And six.

1190
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:10,770
So...

1191
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:10,890
Oh.

1192
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,210
I'll, uh...

1193
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:12,750
No, sorry.

1194
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:13,190
Four.

1195
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,450
And six.

1196
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:16,430
One.

1197
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:17,190
Two.

1198
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:17,550
Three.

1199
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:17,950
Four.

1200
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,650
Five.

1201
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:19,270
Six.

1202
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:19,930
Seven.

1203
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:20,130
Eight.

1204
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:20,430
Nine.

1205
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:20,550
Nine.

1206
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,030
Okay.

1207
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:27,910
Okay.

1208
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,510
Can we solve this one yet?

1209
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,130
What was it?

1210
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:31,470
It was two and six, right?

1211
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,290
I don't know if we can yet actually.

1212
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:39,550
Yeah.

1213
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:40,010
Ugh.

1214
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:41,910
Okay.

1215
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:43,450
Let's go...

1216
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,550
Let's go down.

1217
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,610
This one is...

1218
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,330
This one doesn't have very...

1219
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,590
This one has a lot open.

1220
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,530
Do six, two, three, and a light punch.

1221
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,330
Try a column.

1222
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,930
Oh, I guess that works too, right?

1223
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:57,290
Um, let's see.

1224
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:58,390
We need two here.

1225
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,630
So it can't be here.

1226
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:03,670
Um...

1227
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:04,170
Four.

1228
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,040
Can't...

1229
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,280
Four is down here.

1230
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,220
We know.

1231
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:15,780
Um...

1232
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,200
One.

1233
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,140
Three.

1234
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:18,960
Four.

1235
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:19,560
Five.

1236
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,760
Six would be...

1237
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,860
We don't know.

1238
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:25,480
Seven.

1239
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:26,400
Eight.

1240
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,120
And then nine.

1241
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,820
Okay, nine is...

1242
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,620
Not there.

1243
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,420
Oh, nine is here.

1244
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,740
My mind does not want to perceive the grade ones.

1245
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,840
Like the numbers that are inputted in, you know?

1246
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:39,880
Um, okay.

1247
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,240
So...

1248
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:42,440
Four.

1249
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:42,540
Four.

1250
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,180
One extra way to solve Sudoku is solving individual numbers.

1251
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,800
Each number will only show up nine times.

1252
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,940
If there are eight of a number, you know exactly where the last one is without fail.

1253
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,320
Oh...

1254
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,380
Every week.

1255
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,300
I see you.

1256
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:01,940
I see you.

1257
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:04,340
Hahaha!

1258
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:04,480
Okay.

1259
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,380
Um...

1260
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,180
One.

1261
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:07,620
So..

1262
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,620
And six.

1263
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,400
And...

1264
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:15,620
No.

1265
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,200
That's okay.

1266
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,180
Yeah, I don't think I can do them yet.

1267
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,840
One is the center of the bottom middle row.

1268
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,540
This?

1269
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:34,920
Wait.

1270
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:35,800
This?

1271
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,660
Bottom... middle.

1272
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,040
This?

1273
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:39,740
Wait.

1274
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,740
I can't tell when you guys are saying... I can't tell you guys say yeah, and I don't know which one it is.

1275
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,400
I can post the solution in your live tag if you want.

1276
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,060
No, no, no, no, no.

1277
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,500
I cheated for all the other ones, so I'm going to solve this one properly.

1278
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,400
The center one.

1279
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,300
Okay, okay, okay.

1280
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,700
One, two, three.

1281
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,940
How did you deduce that?

1282
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,280
Wait.

1283
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,320
There's also here.

1284
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,100
We can solve this.

1285
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,320
One, three, four, five, six, seven.

1286
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,140
This is eight.

1287
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,380
We can solve that one.

1288
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,180
We can solve that one.

1289
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,280
Okay.

1290
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,840
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1291
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,480
Nine.

1292
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,680
Okay, this is seven.

1293
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,280
Eight.

1294
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,880
Nine.

1295
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,520
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1296
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,980
Seven, eight, nine.

1297
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:32,340
Okay.

1298
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,560
Okay.

1299
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:35,780
Okay.

1300
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,000
And, um...

1301
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,480
Uh, okay.

1302
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,080
I have enough to solve row four.

1303
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:52,360
Yeah.

1304
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,660
One, uh...

1305
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:55,600
Three...

1306
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,280
Ah, ah, ah.

1307
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:56,860
Thank you.

1308
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,400
Four, five, six...

1309
00:49:59,400 --> 00:49:59,880
Seven.

1310
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,080
Okay.

1311
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,060
I think you can finish ones now.

1312
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,620
I'm going to do...

1313
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,040
How I do it.

1314
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,660
Rather than going by number.

1315
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,660
I don't think I can keep track.

1316
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,320
Because I...

1317
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,280
I can't...

1318
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:13,260
I...

1319
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:13,900
I don't think I can.

1320
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,280
Um, let's try...

1321
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,980
So, these ones have just...

1322
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:22,800
Two.

1323
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,340
So...

1324
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,340
Uh, one...

1325
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,360
Uh, two...

1326
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,000
Okay, I don't know.

1327
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,660
Uh, one, two, three, four...

1328
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,480
Five...

1329
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,680
Six, seven...

1330
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:35,770
Eight...

1331
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:37,760
Nine.

1332
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,100
Okay.

1333
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,180
Okay.

1334
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,320
Okay.

1335
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,460
Uh...

1336
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:52,910
Uh...

1337
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:54,650
Uh...

1338
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:54,850
Let's see.

1339
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:57,850
Uh...

1340
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,020
Uh...

1341
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,060
Uh...

1342
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:04,660
Hold on.

1343
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,220
Hold.

1344
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:05,640
Hold.

1345
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,540
Hold, please.

1346
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,140
Uh...

1347
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,600
Second and four right.

1348
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,920
I don't know what that means.

1349
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,660
Uh...

1350
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,400
Oh, wait.

1351
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,140
I can do this.

1352
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:24,520
Wait.

1353
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,520
Yeah, yeah.

1354
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:25,840
Okay.

1355
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,100
So, this is... I can do this one because there's four.

1356
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,100
We're missing four.

1357
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,940
And then I think it's two.

1358
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,180
Okay.

1359
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,300
I can do that one.

1360
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:33,740
Okay.

1361
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,640
We need two here.

1362
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,980
So, two would go here.

1363
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,220
Which means six is here.

1364
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1365
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:56,600
And then one, two, three, four, five, six.

1366
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,860
Okay.

1367
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,180
Kirby movie?

1368
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,440
Starring Tom Holland?

1369
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,320
What?

1370
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,740
Is that real?

1371
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,720
Huh?

1372
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,060
And then this is two.

1373
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:26,960
Okay.

1374
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,940
We need three.

1375
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,260
Three is here.

1376
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,280
What's one, two, three, four, five.

1377
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,300
Okay.

1378
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,260
Okay.

1379
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:43,340
Okay.

1380
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,220
Two.

1381
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,480
Uh, seven.

1382
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,920
Eight, nine.

1383
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,600
And six.

1384
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,390
Mm.

1385
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,040
Uh, one.

1386
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:27,680
Eight.

1387
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,840
All right, I'm pretty good at this.

1388
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,800
Shut up, Nancy Drew.

1389
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,580
Let's call that guy.

1390
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,440
Was it George?

1391
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:00,960
No.

1392
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,360
George is... wait.

1393
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,540
Let's... I think we gotta call... Bess?

1394
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,320
I don't remember who gave us the Sudoku.

1395
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,960
This isn't the time to use my phone.

1396
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:11,700
What do you mean?

1397
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,740
This is all the time.

1398
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,140
I shouldn't talk on my phone here.

1399
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:14,720
In here?

1400
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,780
Okay, let's go outside then, Nancy.

1401
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,200
Oh my god.

1402
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,420
I forgot.

1403
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,800
I think that's my...

1404
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,720
Thanks, Nancy.

1405
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,480
What do you... what did I receive?

1406
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,260
I think maybe she liked the picture I sent of her.

1407
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,360
Way to make a style and avatar.

1408
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:44,160
Phone Fashion Software is here to keep your whole contact list looking fashionably fly.

1409
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,200
Yeah, we made some avatars last time.

1410
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,620
Well, if you like it so much, why don't you use it?

1411
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,760
Anyway, okay, let's call Bess.

1412
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:01,050
Hi, Nancy.

1413
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:01,450
What's up?

1414
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:09,690
Did you get the avatar I sent you, Bess?

1415
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:10,950
I love it!

1416
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:14,490
Oh, is that it?

1417
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,350
How's... how's Kyoto?

1418
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:16,330
How's Kyoto?

1419
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:17,370
It's the best!

1420
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:17,670
Kyoto!

1421
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,390
Yumi's been showing me some of the coolest parts of town.

1422
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,070
The fashion here is crazy.

1423
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,070
Yumi took me to a store.

1424
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,490
Looking like a Conan suspect.

1425
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:26,550
I don't even know how to describe this place.

1426
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,210
It was pink.

1427
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,110
Really, really pink.

1428
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:33,410
It had the pink version of everything you could imagine.

1429
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:34,850
I'm not surprised.

1430
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,110
Neither was I.

1431
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:37,630
But I was a little horrified.

1432
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,990
But then she took us to see the Gion District.

1433
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:40,730
Gion!

1434
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:41,370
So cool.

1435
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:45,750
She was a little grumpy that we wanted to see some traditional plays, but I think she had fun anyway.

1436
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:48,630
The Gion District.

1437
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:51,450
Guy on what?

1438
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,130
What do you guys think of Yumi?

1439
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:54,990
She's so much fun.

1440
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,590
A little pushy sometimes.

1441
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,670
But I feel like I've known her for years, and we've just met.

1442
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:02,230
She seems to really dislike the Ria Khan.

1443
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:04,510
Do you think she'd want to see it closed down?

1444
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,610
Well, I can't say for sure.

1445
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,890
She does really seem to resent that place.

1446
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:09,690
Why are you here?

1447
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:10,730
I only called best.

1448
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,190
But I'm not sure she'd go as far as trying to get it shut down.

1449
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:13,070
I don't know.

1450
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:14,970
I should go.

1451
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:16,130
I'll talk to you later.

1452
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:17,330
Bye, Nancy!

1453
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,410
Bye, Nancy!

1454
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,110
Let's try calling George instead.

1455
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:29,310
Bye!

1456
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:34,510
Well, how...

1457
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,430
Okay, well, how do I contact the guy...

1458
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:37,010
Hold on, let me see.

1459
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:40,390
Oh, I don't have a task list because I'm too good at the game!

1460
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,830
Or so I said!

1461
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:43,490
Uh, let's see.

1462
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,550
Oh, I have some clues though.

1463
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,170
Something seriously spooky is in one of the Ria Khan's mirrors.

1464
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:54,090
But we learned that that can be faked by...

1465
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:56,930
It's like a fake mirror type something.

1466
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:00,250
But whatever the contraption is breaks it each time you use it.

1467
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:05,090
Yumi seems very concerned about the hauntings at the Ria Khan.

1468
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:06,910
Or is she just trying to scare me herself?

1469
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,670
Yumi, the oldest Shimizu daughter.

1470
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,370
Ren Taro seems pretty good with machinery.

1471
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:17,010
And Miwako is the youngest daughter.

1472
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:17,670
Yes, yes.

1473
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:18,430
Observations.

1474
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,330
Oh my goodness.

1475
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,530
Everyone I met here is nice...

1476
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:23,490
Nice enough!

1477
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,390
Wow, okay.

1478
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:33,230
George sent it to you, but I don't know if you have to send it to the guy...

1479
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:35,230
Yeah, I don't know what to do with it now.

1480
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:37,250
Maybe we...

1481
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,510
Talk to...

1482
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:42,730
Miwako.

1483
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,130
Oh, okay.

1484
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:47,970
Don't ask her about the old article.

1485
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,350
Wait, I gotta save the game.

1486
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,090
SAVE THE GAME!

1487
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:53,290
I won't go through that hell again.

1488
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:54,170
Okay.

1489
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,570
You can mail the Sudoku at the front desk.

1490
00:57:59,190 --> 00:57:59,730
Let's...

1491
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:02,390
Do you want to manage the Ria Khan?

1492
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,830
Right now, I have to.

1493
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,770
But it's not that simple.

1494
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,150
Why not?

1495
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:08,470
It just isn't.

1496
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,170
Okay.

1497
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:11,290
Miwako is a little testy.

1498
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,510
She's a little...

1499
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:14,340
She's got a little bit of a...

1500
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:15,670
Attitude.

1501
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,210
We need to go back to the convention.

1502
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,510
Oh, we can try that.

1503
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:23,870
What...

1504
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:24,470
What time is it?

1505
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:24,950
Let's see.

1506
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:26,110
10 PM.

1507
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:26,970
You think he'll be there?

1508
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,450
Maybe we should go to sleep...

1509
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:30,550
Then.

1510
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,770
I need to translate that.

1511
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:32,910
No, you don't, Nancy!

1512
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,670
We translated it last week!

1513
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:37,650
Nancy Drew...

1514
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:38,110
Which one?

1515
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:38,790
Sudoku?

1516
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,050
Get me out of that hill.

1517
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:42,650
Oh, here.

1518
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:45,670
Oh, what?

1519
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:48,710
Oh, I guess we don't need to translate it.

1520
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:52,530
Oh, the envelope's in my room!

1521
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:53,190
Yes!

1522
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:54,010
Thank you!

1523
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:54,630
Oh my goodness.

1524
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:55,270
You're right.

1525
00:58:55,270 --> 00:59:00,110
They did say, like, if I need to send something, this would be awfully handy to have.

1526
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,290
Okay.

1527
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:05,690
You were so right.

1528
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:06,230
Thank you.

1529
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:06,990
Here.

1530
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:09,350
Grab it.

1531
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:10,770
And Sudoku.

1532
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:14,720
Ah!

1533
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:15,300
To...

1534
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:15,680
To...

1535
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,300
To George!

1536
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:18,960
Okay.

1537
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:20,890
Now I think we can...

1538
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,040
Leave?

1539
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,540
Turn around.

1540
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:29,760
This makes me want to play, like, an FMV-style game.

1541
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,520
Like, the movement, you know?

1542
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,730
Got me feeling...

1543
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:36,960
Hi!

1544
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:37,780
Like that.

1545
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,400
Uh...

1546
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,620
Can I leave this here for my friend to pick up?

1547
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,960
Can I leave this here for my friend to pick up?

1548
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:43,640
Yes.

1549
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:44,720
Yes.

1550
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,300
Thanks!

1551
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:48,200
Thanks!

1552
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,280
Thanks!

1553
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,140
From what I understand, the Ryokan has quite the reputation for being haunted.

1554
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,960
Thank you for reminding me about the...

1555
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,360
It is true that we have the reputation.

1556
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:58,720
The envelope.

1557
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,260
Has that been difficult for business?

1558
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,980
It is nothing you need to concern yourself over.

1559
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:07,660
Can you think of anyone who would stand to gain if the Ryokan went out?

1560
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:08,800
Nosy Nancy.

1561
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:09,720
No one I know.

1562
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,760
We all depend upon the Ryokan.

1563
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,780
Even Yumi and Rentaro.

1564
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,520
What about someone else?

1565
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:17,440
On the outside?

1566
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:18,560
No.

1567
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,320
There's no one else.

1568
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,100
Okay.

1569
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:24,600
Oh, okay.

1570
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,060
She says, mind your business.

1571
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,440
She's like, there's nobody else.

1572
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,480
How does your grandma feel about the Ryokan?

1573
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,820
How does your grandmother feel about the Ryokan?

1574
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:32,360
The Ryokan.

1575
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,360
It's her whole world.

1576
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:37,220
She loves it more than anything or anyone she's ever met.

1577
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,880
What does she think of Yumi not working here?

1578
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,160
It's a very sore subject for her.

1579
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,840
And honestly, I've heard too much about it already.

1580
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:46,740
Ooh, the tea?

1581
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:47,680
What do you mean?

1582
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,300
Every day I'm here, making sure all is well.

1583
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,800
It would just be nice to hear her at least mention all of the work I do.

1584
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,320
Just once.

1585
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,820
I'm sorry, this is nothing you want to hear about.

1586
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,300
She feels underappreciated.

1587
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,460
Do you think Yumi is ever going to come back here to run the Ryokan?

1588
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,020
If she knows what's good for her.

1589
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,100
Damn!

1590
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,720
Why doesn't Yumi work here at the Ryokan?

1591
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,300
The Ryokan.

1592
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,180
She's very...

1593
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,520
My mother used to call her a free spirit.

1594
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,960
But that's a nice way of saying that Yumi is selfish and doesn't want to help.

1595
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:25,500
Damn!

1596
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,260
Do you and Yumi get along?

1597
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:27,960
No.

1598
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:28,980
No.

1599
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,480
So fast!

1600
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,600
She's trauma dumping on me.

1601
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:37,580
Well, I'm the one asking the question.

1602
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,680
I'm asking the questions though.

1603
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:40,960
Do you guys get along?

1604
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:41,660
No.

1605
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,520
No.

1606
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,040
How long have you been fighting?

1607
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,540
How long have you been fighting?

1608
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:52,920
I'm not sure, but she probably picked a fight with me the day I was born.

1609
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,460
Did you and Yumi ever get along?

1610
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:56,500
Of course.

1611
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,600
Yeah, I'm trauma picking.

1612
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,220
That's a Nancy staple though.

1613
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,140
She really...

1614
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:05,540
She was a very good big sister to have after what happened with our mother.

1615
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:06,160
Aww.

1616
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:11,520
But soon enough, she was back to being the selfish, manipulative brat she is today.

1617
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,300
What if she doesn't seem very bratty to me?

1618
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,260
I'm gonna get on Miwako's bad side.

1619
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,480
She does seem...

1620
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,580
She does seem a little... demanding.

1621
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,160
Not demanding.

1622
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,200
Manipulative and bratty.

1623
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:24,980
Oh my god.

1624
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,520
Trust me.

1625
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,120
I've thought this one through.

1626
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,080
Damn.

1627
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,260
Okay.

1628
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,560
I'll talk to you later.

1629
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,140
Okay.

1630
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:31,600
See ya.

1631
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:32,600
Yeah, bye.

1632
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:33,500
Bye.

1633
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,680
Don't get on Miwako's bad side, you guys.

1634
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,240
She'll call you...

1635
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:37,880
She's...

1636
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,060
Damn.

1637
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:40,680
Okay.

1638
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:45,660
So, we have to wait for George to come and pick up the...

1639
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,100
The book.

1640
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,040
So...

1641
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,140
I don't know if she...

1642
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:52,940
Like if we...

1643
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:55,940
If we...

1644
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,620
Need to go to sleep for that, or what?

1645
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,340
So let's...

1646
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,320
I think sleeping would probably be the...

1647
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,040
Probably the best thing?

1648
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:11,680
Probably?

1649
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,440
Oh yes.

1650
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:15,640
Wait.

1651
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,940
Oh, I can't go to sleep yet?

1652
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:18,540
I can't?

1653
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,540
Put out the...

1654
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:21,160
Put out the futon.

1655
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,560
I'll do it myself.

1656
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:23,860
Since...

1657
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,300
I don't have decent service here.

1658
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:26,740
Hello, please.

1659
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,120
Let me go to sleep.

1660
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,320
Is there a time limit in this game?

1661
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:32,900
I don't...

1662
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:33,540
No, actually.

1663
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,680
Please let me sleep!

1664
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,320
Do you have any new numbers?

1665
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,040
I don't think so.

1666
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:42,940
I have Yumi.

1667
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,360
I can call her.

1668
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:45,340
Hello!

1669
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:53,800
Hello!

1670
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:54,180
Not in...

1671
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:55,780
My...

1672
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:03,070
Uh...

1673
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:04,970
Let's set an alarm...

1674
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:06,130
For...

1675
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:08,170
Um...

1676
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:08,770
It's...

1677
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:09,550
It's 10 PM!

1678
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,650
Maybe if I leave the room and come back in...

1679
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:12,790
The bed will be made.

1680
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:13,050
No?

1681
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:14,890
Oh!

1682
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:15,410
Oh!

1683
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:15,770
Si!

1684
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:16,370
I'm a genius!

1685
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,510
Wait.

1686
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:21,210
Go to sleep.

1687
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:22,430
Go to sleep.

1688
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:25,090
Nancy, go to sleep.

1689
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:25,990
Nevermind.

1690
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:27,730
Thank you, door!

1691
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:28,010
Go!

1692
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:32,890
Some even have different colors for numbers to make it easier to see.

1693
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:33,470
Not this one.

1694
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:34,170
Thank you!

1695
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:35,930
Okay, nevermind.

1696
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:36,690
I thought...

1697
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:38,470
I remember being able to like, click it.

1698
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:41,490
Being like, okay, I'm right for bed, but I guess you have to set the alarm.

1699
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:42,210
Okay.

1700
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:42,730
Um...

1701
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:44,170
Let's set it for...

1702
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:47,070
3...

1703
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:47,930
AM.

1704
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:49,170
Oh boy, 3 AM!

1705
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:49,790
You think she'll...

1706
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:51,290
She'll pick it up by...

1707
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:52,150
11 AM.

1708
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,770
I'll be teaching then.

1709
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:54,130
Okay.

1710
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:54,690
I should set...

1711
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:55,650
I'll be teaching then.

1712
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:56,910
Can't set my alarm...

1713
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:57,130
Okay.

1714
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:57,650
Okay.

1715
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:58,130
Okay.

1716
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:58,750
Okay.

1717
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:59,190
Okay.

1718
01:04:59,430 --> 01:04:59,830
Okay.

1719
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,470
I'll be teaching then.

1720
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:02,810
I'll be busy then.

1721
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:04,350
Better call it a night.

1722
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,620
I'll be teaching...

1723
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,840
I'll be teaching...

1724
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,000
I'll be teaching...

1725
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:17,980
I'll be teaching...

1726
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,680
Return of DJ...

1727
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,760
Oh my gosh, I forgot my...

1728
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,640
My alarm is this...

1729
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:23,780
Explosion!

1730
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,160
How so I...

1731
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,560
Have these students...

1732
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,300
I had to do...

1733
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,040
Like, I had to grade their homework before.

1734
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,760
I guess...

1735
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,680
Not anymore.

1736
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,700
Hi kids!

1737
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:36,890
Can you say...

1738
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:37,660
Kuro?

1739
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,220
Hi kids!

1740
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,440
Can you say...

1741
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:41,800
Neko?

1742
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,040
Can you say...

1743
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,400
Aka?

1744
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,320
Alright.

1745
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,960
Let's go see...

1746
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,420
Did my friend pick up the thing?

1747
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,040
She pick it up?

1748
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,060
I should go.

1749
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,240
I'll talk to you later.

1750
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:57,900
Okay.

1751
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:58,320
See ya.

1752
01:05:58,860 --> 01:05:59,200
See ya.

1753
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,760
Let's call George then?

1754
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,340
Can't use my phone here.

1755
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:09,080
Oh, Nancy Drew and your manners.

1756
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,360
G-g-g-g-g-g.

1757
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:15,780
Oh, whoops.

1758
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,100
Wrong.

1759
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:17,500
Oh.

1760
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:27,950
Were you able to...

1761
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:28,870
A word to calm Suki?

1762
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:29,310
Nice.

1763
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:29,490
Yeah.

1764
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:30,230
It's mate.

1765
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:32,670
Got it.

1766
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:33,250
Thanks.

1767
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:34,550
Need anything else?

1768
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,750
Did you learn any more Suki commands?

1769
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:40,590
Oh, yeah.

1770
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:41,530
Get a piece of paper.

1771
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:42,050
I've got a bunch.

1772
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:43,830
Tate, that means stand.

1773
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:44,130
Yeah.

1774
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:45,030
Omowari.

1775
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:46,770
Not sure what that one is.

1776
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:48,150
And we've got buruwa.

1777
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,190
That means something.

1778
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:50,430
Oh, and shizukani.

1779
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:51,750
I think that's it.

1780
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:53,550
Ha ha ha ha.

1781
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:56,850
Ha ha ha ha.

1782
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:56,970
Ha ha ha.

1783
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:57,310
Ma tai.

1784
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:58,410
Chota ma tai.

1785
01:06:59,170 --> 01:06:59,650
Bu...

1786
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:00,510
Bu...

1787
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:00,810
Bu...

1788
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:00,830
Bu...

1789
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:00,890
Bu...

1790
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:01,730
Oh.

1791
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:06,510
Oh...

1792
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:06,770
Okay.

1793
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:07,670
I'm not getting...

1794
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:09,310
I'm not getting very far with you, Woko.

1795
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:10,070
I wonder if we can use these.

1796
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:10,590
That'll be fine.

1797
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:10,870
What do you mean?

1798
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:13,790
She never seems to answer my questions directly.

1799
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:14,490
She's a can.

1800
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:15,570
That's never a good sign.

1801
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:15,970
Ma tai.

1802
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,130
I'd keep an eye on her.

1803
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:20,730
She could just be quiet, or she could be hiding something.

1804
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:21,490
So true.

1805
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:23,470
I'll talk to you later.

1806
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:24,490
Talk to you later.

1807
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:26,410
George is so nihongojojo.

1808
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:29,830
I bet, I bet, the creator was like...

1809
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:30,030
Yeah!

1810
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:32,970
Okay, now we have to wait...

1811
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:35,750
Hi!

1812
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:37,350
Okay, until 1am.

1813
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:40,890
We gotta get into that computer, you guys!

1814
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:44,450
I'll let you go.

1815
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,050
Bye!

1816
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:45,830
Bye!

1817
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,380
Time skip simulator.

1818
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,040
Let's wake up at 1am.

1819
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,200
Can't sleep here.

1820
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,620
Okay, Nancy.

1821
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,980
She's so proper.

1822
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,080
Alright, let's go to our room.

1823
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,520
And we'll nap.

1824
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,640
I don't think there's anything else I can do!

1825
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,640
Probably not.

1826
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,680
I imagine.

1827
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:20,080
Okay.

1828
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:22,240
One...

1829
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,620
Nancy, why can't you just sleep in the lobby, huh?

1830
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:27,540
A.M.

1831
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:27,960
set.

1832
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,040
Let's go.

1833
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:32,360
Okay.

1834
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:38,000
Oh, it's one hour... 1am spooky time.

1835
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,640
Hi, Suki.

1836
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:45,440
Hi, Suki.

1837
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:46,660
What's up, cat?

1838
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:48,860
Umawari.

1839
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,620
What if I say Shizukani?

1840
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:52,900
Shizukani.

1841
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:54,120
Shizukani.

1842
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,500
Oh, cute!

1843
01:08:59,300 --> 01:08:59,800
Cute!

1844
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,620
What's up, cat?

1845
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:02,620
Omawari.

1846
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,520
I'm scared of what this one's gonna do.

1847
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,220
Omawari.

1848
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,720
I think I had every right.

1849
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:21,210
I think I had every right.

1850
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,670
I think I had every right to be afraid of what I was gonna do.

1851
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:24,630
Suki.

1852
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:26,950
Let's try burua.

1853
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:28,670
Suki, burua.

1854
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,370
Burua, burua.

1855
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:39,890
Who created this?

1856
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,250
Suki, who's a good girl?

1857
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:43,750
What kind of sicko?

1858
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:46,890
Suki, mate.

1859
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:48,630
Suki, mate.

1860
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:52,830
It sounds like Matara speaking Japanese, I'm not gonna lie.

1861
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,910
Suki, who's a good girl?

1862
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:00,770
Wait, wait, so I can get in now?

1863
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,650
I'd better get back to the case.

1864
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:09,450
Who's my favorite robotic cat?

1865
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:11,850
Suki, mate.

1866
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:12,690
Mate.

1867
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,190
What's up, cat?

1868
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:16,310
I should keep exploring.

1869
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,050
Wait, what am I supposed to be...

1870
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:19,270
Oh, here we go.

1871
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:21,610
Oh, oh, cutscene.

1872
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:23,470
Suki, mate.

1873
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:25,330
Suki, mate.

1874
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:28,690
Suki, mate.

1875
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:31,270
Suki, mate.

1876
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:34,590
Good news, Suki was actually here to protect you.

1877
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:36,810
The bad news is that thinking Ren is...

1878
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:37,490
Wait, what?

1879
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:41,830
What?

1880
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:45,950
Oh my god, it's the cat.

1881
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:47,830
How did we die?

1882
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:50,950
What's up, cat?

1883
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:52,790
Suki killed me.

1884
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:56,830
Suki, mate.

1885
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:58,150
Suki, mate.

1886
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:00,970
Oh!

1887
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:01,930
Okay.

1888
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:04,650
What the hell is this?

1889
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:09,910
What is this?

1890
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,670
What the hell is this?

1891
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:13,710
Oh no.

1892
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,090
What am I supposed...

1893
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:16,870
Oh!

1894
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:17,890
Oh!

1895
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:18,810
Okay, okay.

1896
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,230
What the...

1897
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:32,480
What?

1898
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:36,880
What is the...

1899
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:40,280
What is the end goal here?

1900
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,500
Oh, you got this.

1901
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,400
What is the end goal here?

1902
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:55,250
I'm actually not...

1903
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,960
Sure what we gotta do.

1904
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:01,020
Sure what we gotta do.

1905
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:02,520
Wait.

1906
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:04,960
It was make a pattern.

1907
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,680
Like it already was the pattern.

1908
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:08,780
Like this.

1909
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:10,620
It's already the pattern.

1910
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:11,120
What?

1911
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,460
Can you split them?

1912
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,020
It's not letting me...

1913
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:15,820
You see?

1914
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:21,140
Like if I just select one, it won't let me move it to the other side.

1915
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:26,020
Hmm...

1916
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,200
What?

1917
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,240
Wait!

1918
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1919
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:31,620
Oh!

1920
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,220
What did I just do?

1921
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,940
I caught something.

1922
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:40,690
Oh!

1923
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:46,770
Oh!

1924
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:47,730
Oh!

1925
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:49,870
Oh!

1926
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:50,350
Oh!

1927
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:50,810
Oh!

1928
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:50,910
Oh!

1929
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:50,930
Oh!

1930
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:51,590
Oh!

1931
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:51,610
Oh!

1932
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:51,650
Okay.

1933
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:53,050
I'm doing it.

1934
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:56,030
Somehow.

1935
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:00,870
Uh...

1936
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:04,110
Ah!

1937
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:04,810
Ah!

1938
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:05,410
Ah!

1939
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:07,930
Okay.

1940
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:10,790
Can they go...

1941
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:11,770
They can only go down.

1942
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:12,930
Oh!

1943
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:26,050
The...

1944
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:26,670
Okay.

1945
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:32,360
Uh...

1946
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,020
Can it go up?

1947
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:34,420
It cannot.

1948
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:38,520
Ah!

1949
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:39,180
Oh!

1950
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,990
But this also can only go to the right.

1951
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:50,530
Unless...

1952
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:52,190
Wait.

1953
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:52,830
Oh no!

1954
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:54,210
Okay.

1955
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:57,650
Yeah.

1956
01:13:58,940 --> 01:13:59,790
I don't...

1957
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:00,090
I have...

1958
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,850
I'm literally brute forcing it.

1959
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:03,450
I have no idea what this is.

1960
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:06,790
This is so str...

1961
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:07,290
Oh, wait!

1962
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:27,680
What?

1963
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,980
Nancy-san, what the hell is this?

1964
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,140
Oh?

1965
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,300
I don't get it at all.

1966
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,520
But, uh...

1967
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:41,580
But, uh...

1968
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,140
We're doing it?

1969
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:43,560
Somehow?

1970
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,600
Wait, what if we...

1971
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,640
What if we went down?

1972
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,700
Oh, we can't.

1973
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:48,980
Okay.

1974
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,420
This one is also...

1975
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:53,580
We can't move this one anymore.

1976
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,180
More?

1977
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,680
It's literally off the screen.

1978
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,100
Okay.

1979
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,380
And we can't move this one anymore.

1980
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:06,920
Maybe...

1981
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,080
We can move it...

1982
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:08,620
If it's...

1983
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:09,120
Like this?

1984
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:11,660
Oh, wait.

1985
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:12,980
Oh!

1986
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,880
I wonder what the hit from the puzzle is.

1987
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,300
The tabs don't even do anything.

1988
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:30,120
I think we just have to get it all the way over.

1989
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:34,640
Okay.

1990
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,400
What the hell is this?

1991
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:49,630
Okay.

1992
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:56,850
World's most nonsensical puzzle.

1993
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:01,410
No, maybe if...

1994
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:04,810
Ah!

1995
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:05,770
Alright!

1996
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:06,650
It's open!

1997
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:09,270
What the hell was that?

1998
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:13,770
What?

1999
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:15,390
Uh...

2000
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:16,630
We got a razor blade.

2001
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:18,990
I need to translate this.

2002
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:19,770
It says a pasuado.

2003
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:23,430
Nancy-san.

2004
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:24,250
Come on.

2005
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,410
Oh, okay.

2006
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:27,150
And then...

2007
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:28,170
Dear Marianne.

2008
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:29,810
It's finally winter.

2009
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:31,550
You'll be here in a few weeks.

2010
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:34,270
And I might just end up giving you this letter in person.

2011
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:34,850
Sorry!

2012
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,830
It snowed for the first time last night.

2013
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,710
It's always my favorite night of the year.

2014
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:43,890
Miwako and Rentaro came in the house looking like a couple of snowmen.

2015
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,050
We had hot tea by the fire.

2016
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:49,210
And for a full ten minutes, Rentaro was too cold to talk.

2017
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:50,050
That was a...

2018
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:51,570
That was really nice.

2019
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:55,150
The password is password.

2020
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:56,110
Just in Japanese.

2021
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,790
It had been a while since I'd spent any time around Miwako.

2022
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:02,810
And for once I caught her in a chatty mood.

2023
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:04,550
She's gotten so quiet lately.

2024
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:07,710
She's been like a shadow wandering around the house.

2025
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:08,050
Oh!

2026
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:10,010
Shadow at the water's edge!

2027
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:13,810
Last night she was back to the funny, goofy girl I remember.

2028
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:14,730
Wait.

2029
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:16,810
I remember...

2030
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:18,630
From not long ago.

2031
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:20,050
Then you won't believe this.

2032
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:23,130
Yumi came in and joined us of her own free will.

2033
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:25,050
And then my mother came in.

2034
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:26,450
And we all played a game.

2035
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:28,270
Now you gotta re-lock it.

2036
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,250
And we all played a game.

2037
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:34,650
No one was forced to join in.

2038
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:35,530
There was no bickering.

2039
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:38,730
Rentaro didn't even have a freakout over the rules midway through.

2040
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:40,270
It was like a gift from the universe.

2041
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:42,770
I knew that in the morning we'd be back to bickering.

2042
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:43,350
The complaining.

2043
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:44,650
The moody silences.

2044
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:45,710
But it didn't matter.

2045
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:48,690
One night like that is worth years of near misses.

2046
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:50,350
Who is writing these?

2047
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:51,670
Because it's not Miwako.

2048
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:54,290
It's not Yumi.

2049
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:56,050
So it's not the two sisters.

2050
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:00,630
And then Meri- Who's Meri- There's so many.

2051
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:03,730
I have no idea.

2052
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,970
Anything else we can grab here while Suki is matting?

2053
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:09,050
Okay, hold on.

2054
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:09,830
Let's investigate.

2055
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:11,990
Oh, password?

2056
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:15,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2057
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:15,250
Okay.

2058
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:15,870
Hmm.

2059
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:19,770
I need a way to open this envelope without anyone knowing I did.

2060
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:20,990
What about...

2061
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:21,590
This?

2062
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:24,190
The razor blade.

2063
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:26,670
Without no...

2064
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:27,070
Anybody...

2065
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:28,210
Maybe the card?

2066
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:29,370
No?

2067
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:33,490
A way of opening it without anybody knowing...

2068
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:34,450
What is this?

2069
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,750
Oh, this is my Pacheco stuff.

2070
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,300
A way of opening it.

2071
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:49,450
What if we opened it in the...

2072
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:50,250
In the onsen?

2073
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:52,550
No!

2074
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:55,130
I'll have to wait until the banner changes color.

2075
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:56,890
No, don't, don't!

2076
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:00,050
When will that be?

2077
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:05,110
Tea kettle boils water.

2078
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:06,370
Where...

2079
01:19:06,370 --> 01:19:07,290
Do we have a tea kettle?

2080
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:09,230
In our room?

2081
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:19,840
Save?

2082
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:20,960
Yeah, I guess we should save.

2083
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,960
I wanna be at Mint's Water Edge.

2084
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,000
What does that mean?

2085
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,400
Maybe...

2086
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:34,060
Wait...

2087
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:35,180
This?

2088
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:38,120
Right here?

2089
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:38,840
Maybe?

2090
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:40,480
Oh, but it's not water.

2091
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:40,820
Ah!

2092
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:42,360
That fire is hot.

2093
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,680
Not surprisingly.

2094
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:44,780
Nancy drew.

2095
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,740
Just set it on fire.

2096
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,480
I need a dictionary to translate that.

2097
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:49,140
Oh my god.

2098
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,080
Nancy, please.

2099
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,140
I guess not.

2100
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:56,800
Okay.

2101
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:57,620
Wait, I'm stuck.

2102
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:57,980
Okay.

2103
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,520
Ah...

2104
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:02,660
But we can't...

2105
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:05,240
I imagine we can't keep it until day, right?

2106
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,520
Because...

2107
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,540
Because she'll notice it's gone.

2108
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,060
I imagine.

2109
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,660
Is there anything out here?

2110
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:19,430
Rentaro?

2111
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:20,210
Oh, he's asleep.

2112
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:21,110
Wait, oh...

2113
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:21,330
Uh...

2114
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:22,810
Does he have a tea kettle or anything?

2115
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:23,390
No.

2116
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:27,920
Is she building metal gear?

2117
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:30,840
Can Suki open it with her claws?

2118
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:31,120
Yeah.

2119
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:40,150
Oh...

2120
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:41,570
The deer scare...

2121
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:42,930
Moving scared me!

2122
01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:46,170
Eww...

2123
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:47,530
Eww...

2124
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:50,470
Do handheld dictionaries actually work for translating stuff?

2125
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:51,350
I don't think so.

2126
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:52,690
I mean...

2127
01:20:52,690 --> 01:20:52,890
Pro...

2128
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:53,290
Like...

2129
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:53,670
Yes?

2130
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:54,610
Right?

2131
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:55,630
They have to.

2132
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:03,170
Who's my favorite robotic cat?

2133
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:05,690
Who's my favorite robotic cat?

2134
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,670
I should keep exploring.

2135
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:08,710
How...

2136
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:09,030
Let's...

2137
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,090
Let's set a timer for like 3am.

2138
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:12,750
Oh boy, 3am.

2139
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:15,050
Oh wait, I have to do it in my room.

2140
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,960
And then maybe it will be ladies hour.

2141
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,480
Everybody knows...

2142
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,500
Bewitching hour?

2143
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:24,940
No.

2144
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:27,040
3am is the ladies hour.

2145
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:28,820
Locked.

2146
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:29,180
Oops.

2147
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:34,550
Okay.

2148
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:38,800
Drew Crew.

2149
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:39,880
What is that from?

2150
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:42,100
I see so many people say Drew Crew.

2151
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:44,260
Oh, why am...

2152
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:45,160
Why am I...

2153
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:45,500
Doing that?

2154
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:46,920
3am.

2155
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:51,730
Alright.

2156
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:53,450
Our explosive...

2157
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:54,290
Wake...

2158
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:54,630
Up.

2159
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:58,070
And it's...

2160
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:58,390
No!

2161
01:21:58,610 --> 01:21:58,810
Why?

2162
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:00,490
It's men only right now.

2163
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:02,010
Why do the men have...

2164
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:03,250
So many hours?

2165
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:10,780
Just the name of the scene.

2166
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:11,500
That's fun.

2167
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,040
Yeah.

2168
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,120
What

2169
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:19,010
are we...

2170
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:23,870
Stalk out.

2171
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:24,470
Welcome to membership.

2172
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:25,210
Thank you.

2173
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:27,910
Can you advance the time?

2174
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:29,270
And that's what we just did.

2175
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,360
How...

2176
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,040
What do we do?

2177
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:43,380
Just wander until...

2178
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:45,580
The...

2179
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:47,900
Ladies hour?

2180
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,020
Before?

2181
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:48,620
Or...

2182
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:49,760
Will they even change it?

2183
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:50,940
Before...

2184
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:52,700
Before...

2185
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:53,640
Before we...

2186
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,480
Get to...

2187
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,200
I mean...

2188
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:55,900
I don't even know if...

2189
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:57,680
If what I'm trying to do is correct either.

2190
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,360
Need a hint?

2191
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:03,140
Maybe there's another way to open it.

2192
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:05,640
Yeah...

2193
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:07,950
I just don't know what...

2194
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:08,570
But...

2195
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:09,450
Oh gosh.

2196
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:10,410
Scared me, Mom.

2197
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:13,630
Down here is just...

2198
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:15,450
The culture room.

2199
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:18,690
Yeah...

2200
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:20,070
Oh...

2201
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:23,830
I don't think there's anything up...

2202
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:24,250
Here?

2203
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:26,970
I don't remember being able to go into any of these rooms anyway.

2204
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:28,670
So...

2205
01:23:29,690 --> 01:23:30,050
Um...

2206
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:31,750
What was the other thing you got from the box?

2207
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:32,350
I don't know.

2208
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:33,470
I can't tell what this is.

2209
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:34,890
Oh, a tile piece!

2210
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,730
Is it to that weird puzzle in my room?

2211
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:47,640
In here?

2212
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:48,280
This tile?

2213
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:50,560
Nope.

2214
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:51,080
Oh.

2215
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:53,680
Nope.

2216
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,000
Uh...

2217
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,900
Tile piece?

2218
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:56,500
To what?

2219
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,220
I once thought I was going through a lot of cookies per week.

2220
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,740
Then Nancy showed up and informed me that it was...

2221
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:04,640
Smugglers?

2222
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,520
And there were five secret passages in my house!

2223
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:10,580
What?

2224
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:13,540
Skellum?

2225
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:14,440
What?

2226
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:19,670
Huh?

2227
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:24,280
What?

2228
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:26,640
What?

2229
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:28,080
What does this do with the tile piece?

2230
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:29,200
Is it something in the bathroom?

2231
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,040
But I can't go into the bathroom!

2232
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,880
It's 3.30.

2233
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:38,560
Surely...

2234
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:40,900
It will be ladies hour now.

2235
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:41,860
Oh my god!

2236
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:44,680
Agh!

2237
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:49,550
Agh!

2238
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:52,370
Wow, what do we do?

2239
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:54,450
I'll...

2240
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:54,710
I'll...

2241
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:56,270
I'll set an alarm for 4, I guess.

2242
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:06,920
4am!

2243
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,540
I'll be teaching then.

2244
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:10,040
What?!

2245
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,220
I should set the alarm for later.

2246
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:12,860
Wait, what do you mean you'll be teaching then?

2247
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,380
Nancy Drew, what time?!

2248
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,540
I'll be busy then.

2249
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:18,620
I should set the alarm for a later time.

2250
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:19,740
Uh oh, I think we're screwed.

2251
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:23,060
Wait, should I go put it back or are we gonna...

2252
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:25,820
Is it gonna game over if she discovers that it's missing?

2253
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:29,860
Uh...

2254
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:32,960
Excuse me?

2255
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,800
For lunch I had a big slice of pizza.

2256
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,800
Miso soup with soft shell crab.

2257
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,220
Two small cups green tea and a lemon sorbet.

2258
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,700
What the?

2259
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:43,620
That sounds amazing.

2260
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:45,080
Would you have it?

2261
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:45,380
Yeah.

2262
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:46,480
I saved...

2263
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,300
Yeah, I did save.

2264
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:49,600
I'm just...

2265
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:50,940
You know what?

2266
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:51,700
Screw it.

2267
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:52,380
Oh!

2268
01:25:58,850 --> 01:25:59,470
Um...

2269
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:01,570
I'm going to sue this...

2270
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:02,030
Uh...

2271
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:02,430
Complex.

2272
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:04,870
Or this...

2273
01:26:04,870 --> 01:26:05,350
Complex.

2274
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:06,230
This ryokan.

2275
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:07,110
Excuse me?

2276
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:08,070
Um...

2277
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:09,110
I almost caught fire.

2278
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:13,830
What the hell was that?

2279
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:16,510
Wait, I feel like we can use this.

2280
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:17,810
But I just...

2281
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:19,310
Don't have a...

2282
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:22,290
I don't have a thing to use it with.

2283
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:23,990
Ah!

2284
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:25,830
Hold on.

2285
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,350
Let's go back to Rentaro's place.

2286
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:34,880
He has like nothing in here.

2287
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,760
That we could use for...

2288
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,960
Like creating steam.

2289
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,000
Isn't there a watering can?

2290
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:43,980
Yeah, but...

2291
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,760
It's not that...

2292
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:49,800
Oh...

2293
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,140
How'd it get so late already?

2294
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:52,620
I should get to bed.

2295
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:53,940
Okay.

2296
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:54,160
Oh.

2297
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:54,540
Oh.

2298
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,100
Oh.

2299
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:55,680
We're forced.

2300
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:56,580
Uh-oh.

2301
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:57,720
I guess we'll see!

2302
01:26:58,260 --> 01:26:58,780
Ooh!

2303
01:26:59,100 --> 01:26:59,820
I guess we'll see!

2304
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:06,840
Ooh!

2305
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:14,680
I guess

2306
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:22,740
we'll see!

2307
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:23,960
I'll talk to you later.

2308
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:24,380
Bye!

2309
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:24,880
She doesn't notice.

2310
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:25,980
She doesn't notice.

2311
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,960
She doesn't notice.

2312
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,060
She doesn't notice.

2313
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:34,160
Yes!

2314
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:37,160
Haunted hot springs.

2315
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:40,360
Haunted hot springs.

2316
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:42,520
Good.

2317
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:43,440
No one's out here.

2318
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:44,140
Okay.

2319
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:46,940
I need a dictionary to translate that.

2320
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,920
Is it so steamy that we can use...

2321
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:50,640
Maybe...

2322
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,180
Maybe not.

2323
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,960
Oh, maybe...

2324
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:54,480
Maybe...

2325
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,100
Wait!

2326
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:55,900
Oh!

2327
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,660
I got the tile piece.

2328
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,960
Where is the tile piece?

2329
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:03,240
Oh, here.

2330
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,800
What am I supposed to do?

2331
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,040
What's the...

2332
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,060
What's the...

2333
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:13,320
What's the...

2334
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:14,740
Okay.

2335
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,260
Is...

2336
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,720
So, do I fit stuff in here?

2337
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:25,300
Oh, wait.

2338
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2339
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,000
Oh...

2340
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:31,700
I see.

2341
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:33,300
Okay.

2342
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,340
Alright, let's figure this out.

2343
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:38,360
Like so.

2344
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,000
I wish I could rotate them.

2345
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,280
Oh, I can only use the things from here.

2346
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,060
What does this do?

2347
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:02,040
Click right to rotate!

2348
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:07,240
Thank you, game.

2349
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:13,570
Thank you, game.

2350
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:15,630
Okay, wait.

2351
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:16,830
Now we have to restart.

2352
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:19,290
Redo, redo, redo, redo.

2353
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:20,390
Okay, hold on.

2354
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:22,670
Okay.

2355
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:24,110
Let's just do that.

2356
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:27,930
Do that.

2357
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:29,850
And do this.

2358
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:35,890
I was like, there's no way you can do this without rotating it.

2359
01:29:36,490 --> 01:29:37,730
It's not possible.

2360
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:38,130
Oh.

2361
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:39,130
I...

2362
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:39,950
Oh, no.

2363
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:41,010
No.

2364
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:42,670
Oh, no.

2365
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:43,890
Where do you fit?

2366
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:45,910
Oh, you are awkward.

2367
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:48,650
Wait, how do you fit the square?

2368
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:51,170
It only goes in the center.

2369
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:54,850
Oh, wait, like...

2370
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:55,910
Okay, hold on.

2371
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:00,360
Wait.

2372
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:00,400
Wait.

2373
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,760
Ah, like that.

2374
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:05,380
Like that.

2375
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:07,620
Like that.

2376
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:10,000
I got it.

2377
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,040
Maybe.

2378
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:13,940
I might have messed it up again.

2379
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:15,680
Oh.

2380
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,100
Oh, we're so close.

2381
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,560
You were right the first time and stopped.

2382
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,180
Well, I didn't know I could rotate.

2383
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:24,560
I just wanted to start over, okay?

2384
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,040
I'll...

2385
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,530
Where would be...

2386
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:39,340
Maybe like that.

2387
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:42,700
Oh, no.

2388
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,480
Cause then I need another small.

2389
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:48,900
I need another small.

2390
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:52,760
Hmm.

2391
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:57,440
The square is messing me up.

2392
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,560
I don't even remember what I did the first time.

2393
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:01,160
Wait.

2394
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:02,040
Oh, no.

2395
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,080
Wait.

2396
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:04,900
If I do this...

2397
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:07,720
I have it.

2398
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:07,980
Wait.

2399
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:08,980
I can...

2400
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:09,580
I can just flop.

2401
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,720
I can just...

2402
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:12,280
Wait.

2403
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,880
I can just...

2404
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:15,920
I can...

2405
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,900
I have it.

2406
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:21,520
Wait.

2407
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:25,260
Wait.

2408
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:27,080
How did I have...

2409
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:29,550
I did it.

2410
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:32,150
Stop.

2411
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:33,270
I've had it.

2412
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:34,130
Oh, my God.

2413
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:35,690
You can't keep avoiding me.

2414
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:37,650
Leave me alone about this.

2415
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:38,870
No.

2416
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:40,610
Who's peeping it on the hot spray?

2417
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:44,590
You talk to me about moving, and every time I bring it up to you, you freak.

2418
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:46,270
Is it not fair?

2419
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:47,270
No.

2420
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:48,590
No.

2421
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:49,650
No.

2422
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:51,910
No.

2423
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:53,050
No.

2424
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:53,830
No.

2425
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:56,750
Oh, shoot.

2426
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:57,910
Walk away.

2427
01:31:58,090 --> 01:31:59,410
Just like always.

2428
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:02,950
Well, maybe I won't be here when you get back.

2429
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:04,210
Oh, shoot.

2430
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:05,530
Speaking Japanese.

2431
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:05,710
Please.

2432
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:08,670
But didn't we learn that...

2433
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:11,530
Didn't we learn that the only...

2434
01:32:13,710 --> 01:32:14,190
Uh...

2435
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:16,630
Person who's Japanese in this game is Miwako.

2436
01:32:17,090 --> 01:32:17,570
So...

2437
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:23,090
Do you guys mind if I go get some more tea, actually?

2438
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:31,820
Yeah.

2439
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:32,300
Yeah.

2440
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:33,060
The voice actors.

2441
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:33,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2442
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:35,960
I can't.

2443
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:36,280
Sorry.

2444
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,960
I've been trying to drink a lot of...

2445
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:38,920
A lot of...

2446
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,560
Wait, so what did that even do, then?

2447
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:44,360
Cuz...

2448
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:44,980
Oh, whoops.

2449
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:45,660
Wrong thing.

2450
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:48,640
Cuz, um...

2451
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,940
We learned that they're having issues.

2452
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:56,520
And then not a whole lot of anything else.

2453
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:01,080
Okay, let me go get my tea.

2454
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:03,980
Let me go get my tea.

2455
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,120
Okay.

2456
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:06,560
You can look at...

2457
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:07,880
Here, you don't have to look at the spooky mirror.

2458
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:10,360
You can...

2459
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,340
You can look right here.

2460
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:11,600
Okay.

2461
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:13,160
You're...

2462
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,920
You're keeping guard in case any...

2463
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:17,260
Any freaks come into the hot springs, okay?

2464
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:19,300
You're keeping watch.

2465
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:44,160
Okay.

2466
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:45,280
Okay.

2467
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:45,780
Okay.

2468
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:46,400
Okay.

2469
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:49,700
Give me one second.

2470
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,020
Okay.

2471
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,000
Okay.

2472
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:15,080
Alright.

2473
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:15,960
So.

2474
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,080
We just learned that...

2475
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:18,930
And then we...

2476
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:20,070
Don't know...

2477
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:21,820
Wait, I'm lost.

2478
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:22,340
Oh, just kidding.

2479
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:25,180
Do you think she'll want to talk about it?

2480
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:26,240
Hi.

2481
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,580
Oh, check on grandma.

2482
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:33,580
Oh, yeah.

2483
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,900
We haven't talked to... I'll talk to you later.

2484
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:36,820
See you later.

2485
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:37,680
What time is it?

2486
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:38,620
Seven.

2487
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:45,160
We're immediately gonna go be like, so, Macchio and your boyfriend, you guys are like the cutest couple.

2488
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,720
How are you guys?

2489
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:47,820
Is this a tea?

2490
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:54,520
Nanasi-san, today we learn cha-do, the tea ceremony.

2491
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:59,460
She's the worst of the fall.

2492
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,000
Nanasi-san.

2493
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,560
Okay.

2494
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:11,300
Okay.

2495
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:16,080
Flens?

2496
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,320
Flens?

2497
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:46,500
Oh, gosh.

2498
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,760
I'm not gonna remember all this.

2499
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,720
This is called the kensui.

2500
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,880
This bamboo ladle is called a hishaku.

2501
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:56,440
You place the teapot cover on the futaoki.

2502
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:59,560
This is the chawan, or tea bowl.

2503
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:02,740
The tea scoop is called the chasaku.

2504
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:05,180
This is the tea container.

2505
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,820
It is called the notsume.

2506
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:12,140
Each object has its proper place in the ceremony.

2507
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:16,180
You must place each item where it belongs.

2508
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:17,380
We're learning so much.

2509
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:17,920
We're learning so much.

2510
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,320
Yeah, from, from, from grandma.

2511
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,520
Which is the teapot cover on the futaoki.

2512
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,480
This is the futaoki.

2513
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:26,460
Oh, my gosh.

2514
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:27,180
I'm not gonna remember.

2515
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:28,080
This is the futaoki.

2516
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:34,420
Oh, my gosh.

2517
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:35,880
I'm not gonna remember.

2518
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:40,420
Futaoki.

2519
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:40,960
This will be good.

2520
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,960
Was this Chakin or Chasen?

2521
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:47,500
I don't remember.

2522
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:48,100
Chashaku.

2523
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:49,160
Why are there so many...

2524
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,060
This is... Oh, gosh.

2525
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,000
I think this is...

2526
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,500
What does the hint say?

2527
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:57,040
Does it?

2528
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:58,180
Let us begin.

2529
01:37:58,440 --> 01:37:58,640
No!

2530
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:00,320
This is called the puro.

2531
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:01,720
Oh, this is the puro.

2532
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:03,240
Here we have the Chasen.

2533
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,260
Oh, this is the puro and this is Chasen.

2534
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,980
Here is the Chakin, the tea cloth.

2535
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:10,480
This is called the kensui.

2536
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:13,600
This bamboo ladle is called a kishaku.

2537
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:17,200
You place the teapot covered on the futaoki.

2538
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:20,280
This is the chawan, or tea bowl.

2539
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:23,480
The tea scoop is called the chasaku.

2540
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,960
This is the tea container.

2541
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:28,240
I can't remember at all.

2542
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,300
Okay, hold on.

2543
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,060
Please shut up!

2544
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,140
Grandma, please!

2545
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:37,120
You must place each item where it belongs.

2546
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:38,800
It's so hard to focus.

2547
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:39,960
It really is!

2548
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:40,740
Okay.

2549
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:42,080
This was the furo.

2550
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:45,580
And then this was the chashaku, I think.

2551
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:46,200
Oh, god.

2552
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:46,800
I don't remember.

2553
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:48,180
I can't...

2554
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,840
I just can't stop.

2555
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:54,480
Chakin is the cloth.

2556
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:55,240
Oh, thank you.

2557
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,780
Small spoon is chashaku.

2558
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:03,600
No, this is the chashaku, no?

2559
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:08,510
This is not a spoon.

2560
01:39:09,670 --> 01:39:10,350
This is...

2561
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:12,370
What was this one, then?

2562
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:15,210
Whisk is the chasen.

2563
01:39:15,470 --> 01:39:16,030
Oh, okay.

2564
01:39:18,670 --> 01:39:19,250
I can't remember.

2565
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:19,710
I don't know.

2566
01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:21,070
I've never done a tea ceremony.

2567
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:22,750
Then, hishaku!

2568
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:27,180
Kensui.

2569
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,080
Guys, something's wrong.

2570
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:32,460
Let us begin.

2571
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,840
This is called the puro.

2572
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:38,860
Here we have the chasen, or tea whisk.

2573
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:39,120
Yeah.

2574
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:42,460
Here is the chakin, the tea cloth.

2575
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:42,760
Yeah.

2576
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:45,380
This is called the kensui.

2577
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,320
This is called the kensui.

2578
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,140
This bamboo ladle is called a hishaku.

2579
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:48,540
Ah!

2580
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:51,720
You place the tea cover on the kataoki.

2581
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:52,520
Ah!

2582
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:54,800
This is the chawan, or tea bowl.

2583
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:58,040
The tea scoop is called the chasenku.

2584
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:00,440
This is the tea container.

2585
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:03,100
It is called the natsume.

2586
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:03,540
Okay.

2587
01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:04,980
These two are switched.

2588
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:07,420
Each object has its proper place in the ceremony.

2589
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:11,620
You must place each item where it belongs.

2590
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:12,200
Okay.

2591
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:15,940
Alright, Grandma.

2592
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:16,300
Thank you.

2593
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:17,500
Well done, Nansisan.

2594
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:19,780
Wonderful, Nancy-san.

2595
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:21,540
Absolutely wonderful.

2596
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:26,960
I would be honored to be invited to take tea with you.

2597
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:28,080
Thanks.

2598
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,600
What's happening?

2599
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,380
Is this our room or the... where are we?

2600
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:40,820
The ghost!

2601
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:52,520
Shaku looks like a hammer to me.

2602
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,500
What do you mean?

2603
01:40:57,860 --> 01:40:59,140
I saw something.

2604
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:03,160
It was the wind, the power lines, and shadows.

2605
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:05,920
This is nothing to worry about.

2606
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:07,060
I'm sorry?

2607
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:08,400
Grandma!

2608
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:11,240
She's gaslighting us.

2609
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:13,840
Why do Yumi and Miwako fight so much?

2610
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:16,700
You're an only child, aren't you?

2611
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:19,080
Well, yes, but...

2612
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:20,260
Siblings fight.

2613
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,760
Let me give you some advice.

2614
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:34,980
If you ever have children, Nancy-san, and they are not fighting, it generally means they are hiding something that they have just broken.

2615
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:40,780
Gosh, I can't stand talking to her because she talks so slow, and I can't pay attention.

2616
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:42,440
I can't pay attention.

2617
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,140
I don't know what to dread.

2618
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:50,660
Why doesn't Yumi want to work here?

2619
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:51,980
She will.

2620
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:55,600
She is just like her mother at that age.

2621
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:58,100
She listens to no one.

2622
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:59,900
Not even herself.

2623
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:03,240
Why can't Miwako just take over the Ryakan?

2624
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:05,380
You do not understand.

2625
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:07,920
That is not how it works.

2626
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:09,840
But she's here now.

2627
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:12,380
It is not what Kasumi wants.

2628
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:14,440
What do you mean, wants?

2629
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:18,560
Nancy-san, I am sorry, but I am very tired.

2630
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:20,100
I should rest.

2631
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:21,980
Wait, wait, I have more questions for you!

2632
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:23,100
Hello, Nancy-san.

2633
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:25,420
Have you been to Yumi's bento stand?

2634
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:26,120
No.

2635
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:30,440
This family.

2636
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,400
They're so like...

2637
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:40,520
They're the most direct Japanese people I've ever heard of ever.

2638
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,680
They're so direct.

2639
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:45,780
It's great.

2640
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:46,720
You'd love it.

2641
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,460
I taught her how to cook for many years.

2642
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:55,340
I should not have to sit on the train to try her bento.

2643
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:57,000
Oh, okay.

2644
01:42:57,620 --> 01:42:58,660
I'll let you go.

2645
01:42:59,080 --> 01:42:59,440
Goodbye.

2646
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,340
Grandma hates public transportation.

2647
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:04,560
Wait, can I use this for...

2648
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,320
Let's see, what do we got in here now?

2649
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:11,410
Can we use this for...

2650
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:14,560
The...

2651
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:22,510
No.

2652
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:26,250
Okay, I guess we just can't sit there.

2653
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:28,730
Oh my god, this scared me!

2654
01:43:29,350 --> 01:43:30,550
Oh my god!

2655
01:43:30,990 --> 01:43:31,210
Hello?

2656
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:31,930
Yumi!

2657
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:36,770
Yumi!

2658
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:43,420
Yumi's jump scaring us.

2659
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:45,920
With her...

2660
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:46,720
Purikuda.

2661
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:47,320
Whatever.

2662
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,100
This is not...

2663
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:49,500
Whatever.

2664
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:51,340
Thank you!

2665
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:53,560
Alright.

2666
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:54,580
Maybe...

2667
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:56,220
We can try it now.

2668
01:43:57,740 --> 01:43:58,840
Stay back, please.

2669
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:00,320
That's very dangerous.

2670
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:01,400
See, there's no...

2671
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:02,820
Tea...

2672
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,120
Kettle on it.

2673
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:07,080
I feel like...

2674
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,000
I feel like she'll see, you know?

2675
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:10,320
She'll get...

2676
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:12,180
She'll get mad at us.

2677
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:14,760
Did it say Roppongi?

2678
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:15,840
No way.

2679
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:17,640
Oh, whoops.

2680
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:23,980
This,

2681
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:28,940
cause it's the ro and the...

2682
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:29,620
Maybe po?

2683
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:30,460
Here?

2684
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:36,400
Oh my god.

2685
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:38,680
Roppongi, baby.

2686
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,760
Wait, so...

2687
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:47,920
What...

2688
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:49,500
Do...

2689
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,960
Let's go talk to Rentaro, maybe, about...

2690
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:52,960
Their relationship.

2691
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,820
I know we can talk to Miwako.

2692
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:55,700
Hello?

2693
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:00,320
Okay, hold on.

2694
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:00,960
I'm gonna save.

2695
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:02,420
Okay.

2696
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:06,720
Raiden remembered April 30th, but still forgot to wish me a happy birthday!

2697
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:07,840
Oh, Ray!

2698
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:09,020
Happy birthday!

2699
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:15,910
Sorry Raiden forgot it, but thank you!

2700
01:45:16,330 --> 01:45:17,070
Thanks for the super time!

2701
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:17,810
Happy, happy birthday!

2702
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:17,930
Yay!

2703
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:20,350
So, you grew up next door?

2704
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:20,750
So, you grew up next door?

2705
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:23,810
My dad and I moved in when I was about seven.

2706
01:45:24,210 --> 01:45:27,690
Why do you spend all of your time here when you live just next door?

2707
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:30,410
Never got my room decorated right.

2708
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:33,750
Plus, this place has always been more fun.

2709
01:45:34,490 --> 01:45:35,750
And Miwako's here.

2710
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:37,810
And I've got my workshop.

2711
01:45:38,490 --> 01:45:39,090
Okay.

2712
01:45:39,970 --> 01:45:42,690
Are things not going well with Miwako and you?

2713
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:44,510
As usual, no.

2714
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:45,490
What do you mean, as usual?

2715
01:45:45,790 --> 01:45:48,190
But this time, a little worse than usual.

2716
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:51,010
She's mad.

2717
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:52,770
Really mad at me.

2718
01:45:53,290 --> 01:45:55,050
I need a way to cheer her up.

2719
01:45:55,770 --> 01:45:56,770
Can I help?

2720
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:58,330
Actually, yes!

2721
01:45:58,890 --> 01:46:03,050
At the Pachinko Parlor, they've got this collar I keep meaning to get for Suki.

2722
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:03,670
A collar?

2723
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:04,590
Why is there a collar?

2724
01:46:04,590 --> 01:46:06,490
If you could get that, it would be huge!

2725
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:07,930
Okay.

2726
01:46:08,350 --> 01:46:09,170
I'll see what I can do.

2727
01:46:09,290 --> 01:46:12,290
Why did I say that the same way as that, see-through?

2728
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,660
Thanks for repairing my screen.

2729
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,520
That was pretty embarrassing.

2730
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:25,100
Oh, no problem.

2731
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:26,160
Easy fix.

2732
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:29,780
Just took a little steam to loosen the paper, a little new glue.

2733
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,060
No one will ever be able to tell.

2734
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,920
Just don't do it again.

2735
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,420
Or at least wait until the paper cuts heal.

2736
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:39,840
I think thinking about paper cuts is way worse than getting there.

2737
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,760
So I think we'll be able to do it with the steam once we get glue.

2738
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:43,060
Why did I bring it up?

2739
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,880
Once we get the glue to seal it back up.

2740
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:47,440
What do you think of Yumi?

2741
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:48,860
Yeah, she's corrupting me.

2742
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:50,800
She's pretty much the older sister you want to have.

2743
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:52,320
She's cool.

2744
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:53,440
She's adventurous.

2745
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:54,760
She's a pain.

2746
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:55,340
She's cool.

2747
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:57,220
But no matter what, she's got your back.

2748
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:00,080
Although, man, can she be bossy.

2749
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:02,780
I'm sure she's already put you to work.

2750
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:04,560
Yeah, a little.

2751
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:05,620
She's cute.

2752
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:05,860
She's cute.

2753
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:07,820
She's cute.

2754
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:10,740
She's cute.

2755
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:11,080
Okay.

2756
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:12,440
I'll stop bugging you now.

2757
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:13,200
Bye.

2758
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:13,820
Bye.

2759
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:14,500
Okay.

2760
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:15,420
Cool.

2761
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:16,900
Actually, we did get some stuff from that.

2762
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:18,420
So...

2763
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:22,320
Let's go to the pachinko parlor, baby!

2764
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:26,400
I guess we don't do the letter just yet.

2765
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:27,920
Pachinko.

2766
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:28,540
Pachinko.

2767
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:29,880
Pachinko.

2768
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:30,200
Oh...

2769
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:32,060
Okay.

2770
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:33,060
Where was it?

2771
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:43,980
Oh...

2772
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:47,520
Uh...

2773
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:47,840
Uh...

2774
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:49,480
Oh, wait.

2775
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:52,360
The way he says cool reminds me of carpets for supper.

2776
01:47:52,540 --> 01:47:53,200
I know!

2777
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:56,540
Uh...

2778
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:56,980
Kure?

2779
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:01,540
We'll try it.

2780
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:09,480
We are...

2781
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:10,570
Yeah!

2782
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:11,590
You were right!

2783
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:12,570
Good memory.

2784
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:13,250
Okay.

2785
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:16,170
That must be the collar that Rintaro was talking about.

2786
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:16,750
Shut up.

2787
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:17,090
Okay.

2788
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:18,290
What?

2789
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:20,010
There's so many new prizes today.

2790
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:20,930
All right.

2791
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:22,110
We have...

2792
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:23,670
206, baby.

2793
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:25,350
We're gonna go to our...

2794
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:27,770
That must be the collar that Rintaro was talking about.

2795
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:28,090
Sorry.

2796
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:29,630
We're gonna go to our...

2797
01:48:29,630 --> 01:48:30,330
Our...

2798
01:48:31,570 --> 01:48:32,090
Uh...

2799
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:34,330
Our lucky...

2800
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:35,650
Lucky one.

2801
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:37,050
I don't remember what I did.

2802
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:38,410
I think I just played a lot.

2803
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:39,870
Wait.

2804
01:48:41,810 --> 01:48:43,450
We have unlimited money.

2805
01:48:43,690 --> 01:48:44,910
On someone's dime.

2806
01:48:45,490 --> 01:48:46,930
We don't know who's...

2807
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:50,010
Whose money this is, but...

2808
01:48:53,530 --> 01:48:54,050
Yeah!

2809
01:48:54,510 --> 01:48:55,250
Pachinko's Dream!

2810
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:04,040
We need to get 2,000.

2811
01:49:05,810 --> 01:49:06,900
No, we're not thieves.

2812
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:08,120
We found it.

2813
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,470
In the...

2814
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:11,500
We...

2815
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,380
It was lost and found.

2816
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:14,500
By me.

2817
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:23,310
Ooh!

2818
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:23,990
Jackpot!

2819
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:30,640
All right.

2820
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:31,240
All right.

2821
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:32,260
We're almost to 1,000.

2822
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:35,700
Nice.

2823
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,740
We're already almost halfway there.

2824
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:39,320
You guys.

2825
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:41,840
More!

2826
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:42,580
Again, again!

2827
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,900
Again, again.

2828
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:45,680
Again.

2829
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:47,260
Again.

2830
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:50,440
Oh!

2831
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:51,840
I forgot to grab my winnings.

2832
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:52,040
Okay.

2833
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,680
Again, again!

2834
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:55,520
Who

2835
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:14,660
knew that this was going to become so integral?

2836
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:17,140
So important.

2837
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:19,180
For the story.

2838
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:21,380
Aw, yeah.

2839
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:48,910
Come on, lady luck.

2840
01:50:49,690 --> 01:50:50,130
Yeah!

2841
01:50:54,910 --> 01:50:55,590
What was that?

2842
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:56,150
What did that mean?

2843
01:50:58,590 --> 01:50:59,030
Okay.

2844
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:00,590
How much do we got?

2845
01:51:02,010 --> 01:51:04,070
I think we're just a hair.

2846
01:51:04,730 --> 01:51:04,930
Oh!

2847
01:51:06,070 --> 01:51:06,950
Just 40!

2848
01:51:07,230 --> 01:51:08,090
Less than 40!

2849
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:10,290
Okay.

2850
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:11,590
Just a little bit more.

2851
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:17,550
Truly just a hair.

2852
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:25,710
Feeding a ghastly gambling addiction.

2853
01:51:25,870 --> 01:51:27,150
It's not my money though!

2854
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:30,090
I'm stealing from this person.

2855
01:51:30,270 --> 01:51:31,830
This person probably like...

2856
01:51:31,830 --> 01:51:33,010
Went to the...

2857
01:51:33,010 --> 01:51:34,170
The ryokan.

2858
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:35,990
And was like...

2859
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:38,690
I'm gonna have the best Japanese vacation of my life!

2860
01:51:39,190 --> 01:51:40,070
I put...

2861
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:41,160
I attached this...

2862
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:43,170
Card...

2863
01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:46,190
This pachinko card to my actual credit card!

2864
01:51:46,530 --> 01:51:49,590
So I never have to think about refilling it.

2865
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:51,710
It just automatically refills it!

2866
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:54,370
And then...

2867
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:58,430
And then they got terrified by the ghost and...

2868
01:51:58,430 --> 01:52:00,110
And fled the country.

2869
01:52:01,770 --> 01:52:03,510
And then Nancy Drew came.

2870
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:05,590
And was curious.

2871
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:06,670
And nosy.

2872
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:08,690
And stole all his money.

2873
01:52:13,650 --> 01:52:14,590
Now they...

2874
01:52:14,590 --> 01:52:14,890
Oh!

2875
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:16,490
We're not doing so hot with this one, you guys.

2876
01:52:17,090 --> 01:52:17,970
Okay, okay.

2877
01:52:18,590 --> 01:52:19,510
But we got enough!

2878
01:52:20,510 --> 01:52:21,130
Yeah!

2879
01:52:22,730 --> 01:52:24,170
We got enough!

2880
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:33,320
Totally for Suki.

2881
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:36,300
What are these other things though?

2882
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:39,980
Like, what is this?

2883
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:41,620
And this?

2884
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,140
And this?

2885
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:42,900
What are all these?

2886
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:43,980
This looks like a candle.

2887
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:46,360
Nancy Drew commits credit card fraud.

2888
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:47,480
No, we don't...

2889
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:47,920
No, no.

2890
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:49,740
Have I ever eaten a cactus?

2891
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:50,680
I haven't.

2892
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:53,060
It tastes like...

2893
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:54,640
I imagine it tastes like aloe.

2894
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:56,080
Let's go gambling!

2895
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:57,220
And what's this?

2896
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:00,680
Yeah, this looks like a...

2897
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:01,100
Fan?

2898
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:03,040
Probably?

2899
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:06,420
Hmm...

2900
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:07,660
What's the really expensive one?

2901
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:07,980
This...

2902
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:08,480
I don't know!

2903
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:12,980
It's not as expensive as the dang collar we had to buy.

2904
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:14,000
But...

2905
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,920
And we...

2906
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:16,860
Uh...

2907
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:17,740
It's Kurume, right?

2908
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:20,760
Oh no, Misawa.

2909
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:27,050
We are in Misawa.

2910
01:53:27,450 --> 01:53:27,970
Okay.

2911
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:31,640
Awesome.

2912
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:35,240
Back to the spooky ryokan.

2913
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:37,160
What time is it anyway?

2914
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,540
Oh, it's not even 9 p.m.

2915
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:40,080
Perfect.

2916
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:41,400
All right.

2917
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:44,160
Hi.

2918
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:47,080
I got that collar for Suki.

2919
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:53,080
Oh, Nancy-san, you are the best guest we've ever had.

2920
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:55,380
I'm going to go give this to her now.

2921
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:57,040
Please, excuse me.

2922
01:53:57,180 --> 01:53:57,420
Okay.

2923
01:53:58,340 --> 01:53:58,860
Bye.

2924
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:03,020
Kind of tastes like grapes.

2925
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:05,900
Wait, can we like explore?

2926
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:06,900
What's this?

2927
01:54:10,540 --> 01:54:11,060
071709.

2928
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:21,210
Rentaro, rentaro, rentaro!

2929
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:30,470
Rookie mistake, my friend.

2930
01:54:32,690 --> 01:54:34,890
Well, I want to see him give it to her.

2931
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:37,190
Did you like it?

2932
01:54:37,210 --> 01:54:37,470
Hi.

2933
01:54:38,510 --> 01:54:40,590
Is Suki wearing a new collar?

2934
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:41,570
Yes.

2935
01:54:42,030 --> 01:54:43,250
Doesn't it look perfect?

2936
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:46,570
Lindalo must have really put some thought into this.

2937
01:54:46,570 --> 01:54:50,190
It fits perfectly, and it goes so well with her eyes.

2938
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:52,770
He can be so thoughtful sometimes.

2939
01:54:53,610 --> 01:54:56,650
I think it's time for me to do something nice for him.

2940
01:54:57,190 --> 01:54:57,330
Oh?

2941
01:55:02,050 --> 01:55:02,610
Yeah.

2942
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:07,690
So, how are things between you and Rentaro now?

2943
01:55:08,050 --> 01:55:09,050
Couldn't be better.

2944
01:55:09,330 --> 01:55:09,950
Oh, wow.

2945
01:55:10,170 --> 01:55:10,450
Okay.

2946
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:12,190
I'll let you get back to work.

2947
01:55:12,190 --> 01:55:14,250
I wonder what she would have said before we...

2948
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:16,570
I wonder what she would have said before the collar.

2949
01:55:17,430 --> 01:55:18,910
How do I get this?

2950
01:55:19,050 --> 01:55:19,230
Okay.

2951
01:55:19,630 --> 01:55:21,230
Maybe we know the steam.

2952
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:23,450
But I don't have the glue.

2953
01:55:26,290 --> 01:55:27,210
Maybe we...

2954
01:55:27,210 --> 01:55:29,230
Let's just still try the...

2955
01:55:30,070 --> 01:55:30,990
The bath.

2956
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:33,870
Maybe Nancy will be like, Oh, yeah.

2957
01:55:34,910 --> 01:55:36,430
I'll figure something out.

2958
01:55:36,630 --> 01:55:37,970
Because I'm Nancy Drew, you know.

2959
01:55:40,210 --> 01:55:41,690
What is the music for?

2960
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:44,670
I need a dictionary to translate that.

2961
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:46,310
Okay.

2962
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:48,170
Alright.

2963
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:49,570
Steam it!

2964
01:55:50,090 --> 01:55:51,170
Steam it, baby!

2965
01:55:52,670 --> 01:55:52,950
No?

2966
01:55:53,230 --> 01:55:53,510
Okay.

2967
01:55:55,370 --> 01:55:59,270
Mint-chan, mint-chan, mint-san, mint-sama.

2968
01:55:59,690 --> 01:56:01,390
Not sama, because I'm a maid.

2969
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:07,100
Can you use the bath?

2970
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:07,400
Oh, wait.

2971
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:11,420
Ah, all mysteries should involve hot springs.

2972
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:13,980
Nancy Drew in the bath.

2973
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:16,260
I can't, like, grab it.

2974
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:17,100
That's what's...

2975
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:18,200
That's what's...

2976
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:19,380
Annoying about it.

2977
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:23,500
It's like, I can't, like...

2978
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:24,520
Click on it, you know.

2979
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:25,900
Like, use in...

2980
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:28,060
Use in...

2981
01:56:28,060 --> 01:56:28,220
Bath.

2982
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:29,040
You know?

2983
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:30,040
Hmm.

2984
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:32,420
So, it must be something else.

2985
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:35,380
We already did this.

2986
01:56:35,620 --> 01:56:36,840
Oh, do you want me to do it again?

2987
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:37,560
No, no.

2988
01:56:37,940 --> 01:56:39,500
I already solved your puzzle.

2989
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:46,260
Okay.

2990
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:48,740
I guess we wait until...

2991
01:56:53,590 --> 01:56:54,410
3 a.m.

2992
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:54,630
again.

2993
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:55,630
Or 1 a.m.?

2994
01:56:56,510 --> 01:56:57,250
I guess?

2995
01:56:58,110 --> 01:57:03,750
I like that Nancy is supposed to be here to teach, and she's just casually got involved in this family drama for no reason.

2996
01:57:04,330 --> 01:57:05,790
That's so Nancy Drew of her.

2997
01:57:06,130 --> 01:57:07,810
That's so Nancy Drew of her, though.

2998
01:57:14,030 --> 01:57:14,970
What do we do?

2999
01:57:15,370 --> 01:57:16,070
We have this.

3000
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:19,490
I feel like this goes to something behind there, but I don't remember what.

3001
01:57:22,570 --> 01:57:23,830
Yeah, let's go to our bed.

3002
01:57:24,970 --> 01:57:25,430
Oops.

3003
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:28,430
Because we can't use this.

3004
01:57:28,430 --> 01:57:30,110
Please stay away from there.

3005
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:31,810
It is very easy to get burned.

3006
01:57:34,270 --> 01:57:34,950
Yeah, see?

3007
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:35,930
I can't grab it.

3008
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:50,810
Good night, world.

3009
01:57:52,570 --> 01:57:53,290
I guess?

3010
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:56,370
1.

3011
01:57:56,650 --> 01:57:56,830
Oh.

3012
01:57:57,190 --> 01:57:57,470
Yeah.

3013
01:57:57,730 --> 01:57:57,910
Yeah.

3014
01:57:58,070 --> 01:57:58,230
1.

3015
01:57:59,650 --> 01:58:01,210
I went the wrong way, but that's okay.

3016
01:58:06,710 --> 01:58:08,750
And now it's spooky music time.

3017
01:58:10,590 --> 01:58:11,070
Okay.

3018
01:58:11,430 --> 01:58:11,990
Let's go back.

3019
01:58:12,450 --> 01:58:13,090
Suki Tate.

3020
01:58:13,790 --> 01:58:14,450
Oh, no, no, no.

3021
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:17,050
I mean, not Suki Imate.

3022
01:58:17,330 --> 01:58:18,990
Oh, she actually does look...

3023
01:58:20,410 --> 01:58:24,350
I was going to say she does look cute with the collar on, but I'm scared of her.

3024
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:26,270
Okay.

3025
01:58:27,830 --> 01:58:28,610
Oh, my God.

3026
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:29,050
Stop.

3027
01:58:29,470 --> 01:58:30,170
Stop it.

3028
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:30,610
Stop.

3029
01:58:30,990 --> 01:58:31,930
Suki, you're scaring me.

3030
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:35,630
Okay, not this.

3031
01:58:35,630 --> 01:58:36,330
No?

3032
01:58:37,570 --> 01:58:38,330
Wait.

3033
01:58:39,690 --> 01:58:41,690
Okay, it's not this.

3034
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:43,990
Ah!

3035
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:48,960
I thought it was one of those cards.

3036
01:58:52,180 --> 01:58:52,740
No!

3037
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:56,080
What was something that needed a...

3038
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,700
Needed a code.

3039
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:05,680
Can we grab the...

3040
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:07,880
You can't...

3041
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:08,760
Or rather...

3042
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:11,660
I don't know if we should have done it earlier.

3043
01:59:11,660 --> 01:59:13,060
I don't think there was a way to.

3044
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:15,660
It's now locked, so we can't go in.

3045
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:16,960
Unless...

3046
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:17,380
Yeah.

3047
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:20,040
It's now locked.

3048
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:21,880
Uh...

3049
01:59:22,220 --> 01:59:23,680
The lockbox.

3050
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:25,560
What was the lockbox?

3051
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:26,820
Where?

3052
01:59:33,940 --> 01:59:35,740
I thought it was a card on her door.

3053
01:59:39,730 --> 01:59:42,250
I wish it would let me see what the numbers were again.

3054
01:59:42,790 --> 01:59:43,650
Magnetic key.

3055
01:59:46,630 --> 01:59:47,090
What?

3056
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:52,050
What were the numbers on it again?

3057
01:59:52,990 --> 01:59:54,330
I can't preview it.

3058
01:59:55,250 --> 01:59:57,010
It's a room key, but the where?

3059
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:03,800
I guess we'll go try everything.

3060
02:00:10,350 --> 02:00:11,030
Locked.

3061
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:11,790
Okay.

3062
02:00:13,230 --> 02:00:14,010
Brute force.

3063
02:00:14,190 --> 02:00:15,750
I don't know if anybody remembers the...

3064
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:15,930
Locked.

3065
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:18,670
The number it was.

3066
02:00:19,810 --> 02:00:20,490
Locked.

3067
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:23,110
Locked.

3068
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:23,310
Oh, whoops.

3069
02:00:23,950 --> 02:00:24,630
Okay.

3070
02:00:27,410 --> 02:00:28,090
Locked.

3071
02:00:30,570 --> 02:00:31,250
Locked.

3072
02:00:40,450 --> 02:00:43,290
I need a key to open this door.

3073
02:00:43,470 --> 02:00:44,230
Yeah, I have one.

3074
02:00:50,060 --> 02:00:50,820
Okay.

3075
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:51,760
Locked.

3076
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:52,620
Locked.

3077
02:00:55,860 --> 02:00:56,240
Locked.

3078
02:00:58,020 --> 02:00:58,780
Locked.

3079
02:00:58,780 --> 02:00:58,920
Locked.

3080
02:00:58,980 --> 02:00:59,620
Locked.

3081
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:02,280
Locked.

3082
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:03,420
Locked.

3083
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:04,220
Locked.

3084
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:04,940
I did use it, right?

3085
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:05,760
Okay, yep.

3086
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:08,920
Locked.

3087
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:09,840
Locked.

3088
02:01:14,540 --> 02:01:16,080
And there's no...

3089
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:19,340
Oh, I was gonna say, there's no teapot, but there's not.

3090
02:01:19,580 --> 02:01:20,120
Dang it.

3091
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:22,680
Let's go try it on the cultural room.

3092
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:23,440
We can see it.

3093
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:24,880
If maybe that'll work.

3094
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:28,180
Ugh.

3095
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:28,660
Dang.

3096
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:30,160
Locked.

3097
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:32,740
Locked.

3098
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:33,700
Locked.

3099
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:37,280
I need a key to open this door.

3100
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:38,280
Locked.

3101
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:39,280
Locked.

3102
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:40,120
Locked.

3103
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:43,060
I need a key to open this door.

3104
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:43,680
Locked.

3105
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:45,960
Locked.

3106
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:47,640
Locked.

3107
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:48,240
Guys, I don't know.

3108
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:49,500
Locked.

3109
02:01:49,740 --> 02:01:50,240
I don't know.

3110
02:01:52,120 --> 02:01:52,520
Locked.

3111
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:53,540
Locked.

3112
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:55,280
Locked.

3113
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:57,340
Maybe we'll get it soon.

3114
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:58,880
I need a key to open this door.

3115
02:01:58,960 --> 02:01:59,960
Maybe we'll get it soon.

3116
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,540
The music is so freaky.

3117
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:04,140
Right now.

3118
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:07,260
Wait, it sounds even scarier than before.

3119
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:11,840
I don't think we've heard this song.

3120
02:02:12,340 --> 02:02:13,060
I don't know.

3121
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:14,220
It's so scary.

3122
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:17,800
Locked.

3123
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:18,640
Locked.

3124
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:25,980
Oh, I just realized I don't have to... Guys, I don't know about this.

3125
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:30,120
I tried all of them.

3126
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:33,600
I tried!

3127
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:39,010
Hmm.

3128
02:02:40,190 --> 02:02:40,250
Oh.

3129
02:02:48,370 --> 02:02:49,910
Try a little more.

3130
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:52,110
Picky.

3131
02:02:53,330 --> 02:02:54,290
So true.

3132
02:02:54,730 --> 02:02:56,790
I don't think there was anything else in here.

3133
02:02:57,770 --> 02:02:59,290
He's got some pliers.

3134
02:03:05,890 --> 02:03:07,450
I'm at a loss.

3135
02:03:07,450 --> 02:03:08,290
This is what to do.

3136
02:03:10,490 --> 02:03:12,270
I'm at a loss.

3137
02:03:12,270 --> 02:03:13,290
This is where...

3138
02:03:13,290 --> 02:03:13,790
Locked.

3139
02:03:13,810 --> 02:03:15,050
Yeah, we did these ones.

3140
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:17,190
Hmm.

3141
02:03:18,910 --> 02:03:20,950
Hint for mint, if anybody has a hint.

3142
02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:33,600
I think it might be a badge for the tech convention.

3143
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:38,120
No, I already tried the tea ceremony room.

3144
02:03:45,580 --> 02:03:49,680
I think that was the thing with color cards and Miyawako's corner.

3145
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:50,800
No, I wasn't.

3146
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:51,580
I already tried that.

3147
02:03:56,160 --> 02:03:57,440
I already tried this.

3148
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:01,280
They don't even look the same.

3149
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:07,320
Did we miss anything at Yumi's place?

3150
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:09,140
Do you think she'll let us in her house?

3151
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:11,560
Do I have... I still have her house key!

3152
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:12,740
Oh my god.

3153
02:04:14,020 --> 02:04:16,240
It's time for a midnight stroll?

3154
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:18,240
Trains are done running for the night.

3155
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:19,020
Just kidding.

3156
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:20,120
Ow!

3157
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:28,600
I thought there was a thing in the closet for the tea ceremony room.

3158
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:31,880
I don't think so.

3159
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:37,820
You need to go to Yumi's apartment.

3160
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,820
There's a book there you need to look at for a phone number.

3161
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:40,220
Ah!

3162
02:04:40,780 --> 02:04:40,940
Okay.

3163
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:42,280
We shall wait until...

3164
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:43,460
Let's go to sleep then.

3165
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:44,640
Thank you!

3166
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:47,260
We shall...

3167
02:04:47,260 --> 02:04:48,160
Shall do.

3168
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:48,680
Oops.

3169
02:04:54,290 --> 02:04:54,690
Okay.

3170
02:04:54,910 --> 02:04:55,630
Good night, everybody.

3171
02:04:55,910 --> 02:04:56,430
Good night, world.

3172
02:04:57,750 --> 02:04:59,570
We'll set our clock for...

3173
02:05:01,550 --> 02:05:02,590
7 p...

3174
02:05:02,590 --> 02:05:03,430
6 p.m.?

3175
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:04,870
I don't remember what time she gets off.

3176
02:05:06,230 --> 02:05:07,630
I'll be teaching then.

3177
02:05:07,810 --> 02:05:08,270
7 p.m.?

3178
02:05:08,270 --> 02:05:08,970
It's really late.

3179
02:05:09,290 --> 02:05:10,230
I should get to bed.

3180
02:05:11,410 --> 02:05:12,810
The Rio-Kan.

3181
02:05:14,210 --> 02:05:14,970
All right.

3182
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:30,740
Can we...

3183
02:05:30,740 --> 02:05:32,180
We can quit the music.

3184
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:37,260
Yumi, Yumi, Yumi, Yumi, Yumi...

3185
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:38,000
Was in...

3186
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:39,420
Kurume...

3187
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:40,520
I think.

3188
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:43,100
Yumi, Yumi, Yumi...

3189
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:44,360
Yumi's house was...

3190
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:45,000
Kurume...

3191
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:45,820
I think.

3192
02:05:48,820 --> 02:05:50,080
What was that explosion?

3193
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:50,900
That's our alarm.

3194
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:53,340
Just, you know, normal.

3195
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:55,060
So there's a book in here.

3196
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,460
Not this.

3197
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:05,320
Because we discovered this.

3198
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:07,180
Oh, what's this?

3199
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:10,020
Okay.

3200
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:13,120
You got games on your computer?

3201
02:06:13,620 --> 02:06:14,980
She's got avatars.

3202
02:06:16,780 --> 02:06:18,520
Oh, these are the ones that I've made.

3203
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:19,140
Oh, God.

3204
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:20,040
They're so scary.

3205
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:25,120
Wait.

3206
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:25,600
Oh.

3207
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:26,540
No.

3208
02:06:26,660 --> 02:06:27,540
I don't think it's this.

3209
02:06:28,700 --> 02:06:29,240
Dang it.

3210
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:30,720
I was going to say, what were the numbers?

3211
02:06:30,860 --> 02:06:31,300
The numbers.

3212
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:33,080
But I don't think it's that.

3213
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:38,060
Because...

3214
02:06:38,060 --> 02:06:39,400
It won't let us...

3215
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:44,380
It wouldn't be the numbers if it didn't let us investigate it again, you know?

3216
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:46,900
There's a book here?

3217
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:55,340
I...

3218
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:56,560
I don't...

3219
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:01,120
On her bed, I think.

3220
02:07:02,740 --> 02:07:03,400
Ah!

3221
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,000
Thank you.

3222
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:07,560
I totally did miss this.

3223
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:08,940
Unveiling ghosts.

3224
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:11,860
Paranormal investigations from around the world.

3225
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:14,340
To the Shimizu family.

3226
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:19,880
Your hospitality during this difficult time has been immeasurable.

3227
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:22,000
Thank you for allowing me into your home and your lives.

3228
02:07:22,220 --> 02:07:25,880
If you ever find yourself in the state of Georgia, you've got a place to stay.

3229
02:07:26,700 --> 02:07:27,420
Sincerely, Savannah...

3230
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:30,660
Her name is Savannah and she's from Georgia.

3231
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:37,290
I guess we know where her parents...

3232
02:07:38,030 --> 02:07:39,550
Where she was conceived.

3233
02:07:45,020 --> 02:07:48,100
Is this handwriting the same as all the letters we've been seeing?

3234
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:50,420
I don't have any of them on.

3235
02:07:51,020 --> 02:07:51,580
Oh!

3236
02:07:54,940 --> 02:08:01,640
Oh my gosh, thank you!

3237
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:05,820
Introduction, A Month in the Haunted Steeps.

3238
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:08,040
Riding the Phantom Pass.

3239
02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:10,520
The Breathing Mansion in Booker M.A.

3240
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:13,300
The Spirits of the Civil War.

3241
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:17,500
I'm sorry.

3242
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:19,360
She's like...

3243
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:20,660
She's like...

3244
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:23,660
She's like...

3245
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:29,820
This book is called Ghosts from Around the World and then it's all America except the Ryokan.

3246
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:31,820
It looks like someone tore out one of the chapters.

3247
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:35,000
Oh...

3248
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:35,920
Ghost 7.

3249
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:37,820
The Ghosts of Centralia, PA.

3250
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,260
Wait, we can't...

3251
02:08:39,260 --> 02:08:40,980
We can't see the rest.

3252
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:43,900
Okay, but we got her phone number.

3253
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:48,240
Let's call her and the time zone will definitely not be a problem.

3254
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:54,860
Savannah Woodham's office.

3255
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:55,640
Logan speaking.

3256
02:08:56,180 --> 02:08:57,780
Can I speak to Savannah Woodham, please?

3257
02:08:58,440 --> 02:08:59,460
Are you one of our interviews?

3258
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:00,800
Interviews?

3259
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:02,560
I'm Savannah Woodham's assistant.

3260
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:05,280
Is she interviewing you about the expo?

3261
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:05,920
The expo?

3262
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:09,140
No, I actually want to speak to Savannah about a book she wrote.

3263
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:10,460
Oh, great!

3264
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:12,040
I'm so glad you called.

3265
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:12,900
Really?

3266
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:14,100
Why's that?

3267
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:17,260
It's been like three days since I've gotten to hang up on anyone.

3268
02:09:17,420 --> 02:09:18,960
I wonder if I'm still good at it.

3269
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:19,780
Oh my god!

3270
02:09:23,970 --> 02:09:24,410
Logan!

3271
02:09:25,730 --> 02:09:27,390
Hold on, this is very important.

3272
02:09:28,390 --> 02:09:29,730
What a jerk!

3273
02:09:30,990 --> 02:09:31,830
Logan speaking.

3274
02:09:32,310 --> 02:09:33,830
Did you just hang up on me?

3275
02:09:34,190 --> 02:09:35,410
Oh, absolutely!

3276
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:37,970
Between you and me, it was awesome!

3277
02:09:38,250 --> 02:09:39,050
In fact...

3278
02:09:39,630 --> 02:09:40,790
Oh my god!

3279
02:09:43,810 --> 02:09:45,770
I can't believe he's still picking up.

3280
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:48,270
Uh-oh.

3281
02:09:48,390 --> 02:09:50,170
You've reached Savannah Woodham's message service.

3282
02:09:50,470 --> 02:09:51,790
I'm not in the office at the moment.

3283
02:09:51,970 --> 02:09:52,750
Please try again.

3284
02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:55,010
He's so rude!

3285
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:00,980
Okay.

3286
02:10:02,940 --> 02:10:03,440
Interesting.

3287
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:06,020
I could just open her doors and...

3288
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:08,900
I saw that someone said that you could go through her closet somehow.

3289
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:10,960
Oh!

3290
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:11,580
There.

3291
02:10:12,240 --> 02:10:12,740
Oh!

3292
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:14,720
I need a dictionary to translate that.

3293
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:15,200
Okay.

3294
02:10:16,980 --> 02:10:17,540
Nancy...

3295
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:20,160
They're telling her to die!

3296
02:10:24,100 --> 02:10:25,300
Oh my gosh!

3297
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:26,260
It's so threatening!

3298
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:29,020
Does she have any glue?

3299
02:10:29,540 --> 02:10:30,380
Wait, what's this?

3300
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:33,040
Oh wait, we can put that in our CD player.

3301
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:36,260
These are so hideous.

3302
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:39,640
Oh my gosh.

3303
02:10:39,860 --> 02:10:40,060
Wow.

3304
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:43,080
Okay.

3305
02:10:43,420 --> 02:10:44,520
We can put it in here.

3306
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:48,620
The mixtape.

3307
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:51,800
Oh

3308
02:10:56,430 --> 02:10:57,250
my eyes!

3309
02:10:59,070 --> 02:11:00,290
What is this?

3310
02:11:00,490 --> 02:11:02,330
Oh god, I'm gonna die in seven days!

3311
02:11:07,170 --> 02:11:08,530
What was that?

3312
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:17,640
Nancy, you're gonna die in seven days!

3313
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:18,540
He's for real!

3314
02:11:18,540 --> 02:11:18,860
He's for real!

3315
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:21,800
Uh...

3316
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:23,020
Okay.

3317
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:24,880
Um...

3318
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:26,280
What was that?

3319
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:30,600
And we are too!

3320
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:32,060
Oh no!

3321
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:32,900
Not me.

3322
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:34,920
I'm already dead.

3323
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:36,840
Sucks to be here though.

3324
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:42,640
Um...

3325
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:42,740
Um...

3326
02:11:42,740 --> 02:11:44,140
I wish Minto would threaten me.

3327
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:46,540
What?

3328
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:48,140
What?

3329
02:11:48,260 --> 02:11:50,120
What could I threaten you with?

3330
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:51,500
That you wouldn't be like...

3331
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:53,960
Don't threaten me with a good time!

3332
02:11:54,620 --> 02:11:56,260
How come you never do that to us?

3333
02:11:56,480 --> 02:11:58,640
Do you even want us dead in seven days or no?

3334
02:11:58,640 --> 02:12:01,220
Did you not watch my Valentine's Day stream?

3335
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:05,960
Huh?

3336
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:09,140
Also, this was an hour ago.

3337
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:10,220
Sam, I'm so sorry.

3338
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:11,300
I just saw your dono.

3339
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:12,660
I'm glad that...

3340
02:12:12,660 --> 02:12:13,960
I'm glad that...

3341
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:16,480
That my older karaoke gave you some...

3342
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:17,360
Needed energy!

3343
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:18,660
I'm sorry!

3344
02:12:19,780 --> 02:12:20,580
I'm sorry.

3345
02:12:20,700 --> 02:12:20,940
I'm sorry.

3346
02:12:21,020 --> 02:12:21,140
I'm sorry.

3347
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:21,880
I just saw it.

3348
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:23,060
I'm so sorry.

3349
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:24,660
Let's see.

3350
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:25,540
Let's talk to Yumi.

3351
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:26,340
Maybe...

3352
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:26,780
Uh...

3353
02:12:26,780 --> 02:12:28,860
Maybe we can go visit her in...

3354
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:29,400
Oh gosh.

3355
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:31,660
It was...

3356
02:12:33,180 --> 02:12:33,960
Oh god.

3357
02:12:34,140 --> 02:12:34,620
Ise!

3358
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:35,300
Oh my gosh.

3359
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:35,940
I love Ise.

3360
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:38,300
Um...

3361
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:39,660
Where was she?

3362
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:40,240
Matsue?

3363
02:12:41,100 --> 02:12:41,640
Matsue.

3364
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:42,460
I think.

3365
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:44,540
Adult things.

3366
02:12:44,700 --> 02:12:45,820
Like taxes or something.

3367
02:12:50,430 --> 02:12:51,030
Yeah!

3368
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:52,330
Okay, cool.

3369
02:12:54,110 --> 02:12:54,710
Hi!

3370
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:55,410
Hi!

3371
02:12:55,870 --> 02:12:58,190
I watched that DVD at your place.

3372
02:12:58,350 --> 02:12:59,750
It was very strange.

3373
02:13:00,450 --> 02:13:01,210
You did what?

3374
02:13:01,650 --> 02:13:02,610
Shouldn't I have?

3375
02:13:02,830 --> 02:13:03,450
Oh no.

3376
02:13:03,710 --> 02:13:04,870
I'm sorry, Yumi.

3377
02:13:05,450 --> 02:13:06,970
I'm sure it'll be fine.

3378
02:13:07,270 --> 02:13:08,710
Just be very cautious.

3379
02:13:09,170 --> 02:13:10,130
What do you mean?

3380
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:13,510
You have to be cautious about everything here, Nancy.

3381
02:13:14,250 --> 02:13:14,950
Oh my god.

3382
02:13:14,950 --> 02:13:15,950
We really are cursed.

3383
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:20,150
We are cursed!

3384
02:13:20,930 --> 02:13:21,910
We are cursed!

3385
02:13:22,570 --> 02:13:23,270
Oh my god!

3386
02:13:23,770 --> 02:13:23,830
Oh my god!

3387
02:13:23,830 --> 02:13:25,230
Can you tell me more about that?

3388
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:27,610
She's some sort of ghost hunter or something.

3389
02:13:27,850 --> 02:13:29,170
I don't know much about it, okay?

3390
02:13:29,470 --> 02:13:31,730
But she did a chapter on the Ryokan.

3391
02:13:32,450 --> 02:13:32,810
Yeah.

3392
02:13:33,150 --> 02:13:36,610
Well, just because my grandmother believes in that junk, doesn't mean I do.

3393
02:13:37,110 --> 02:13:37,370
Oh?

3394
02:13:37,550 --> 02:13:39,390
Wait, I don't think grandma believes in it either.

3395
02:13:39,390 --> 02:13:41,370
I love the picture of George.

3396
02:13:41,550 --> 02:13:41,610
Oh.

3397
02:13:41,830 --> 02:13:43,290
I love the picture of George.

3398
02:13:43,810 --> 02:13:44,150
I know!

3399
02:13:44,330 --> 02:13:45,010
Isn't that one great?

3400
02:13:45,330 --> 02:13:45,350
Oh!

3401
02:13:45,590 --> 02:13:48,430
The picture she sent was of George!

3402
02:13:48,710 --> 02:13:50,090
We were like, who is this?

3403
02:13:50,270 --> 02:13:50,470
Oh!

3404
02:13:50,470 --> 02:13:50,630
Oh!

3405
02:13:51,210 --> 02:13:52,730
I really like your apartment.

3406
02:13:53,110 --> 02:13:53,690
You do?

3407
02:13:53,990 --> 02:13:54,430
Thanks!

3408
02:13:54,690 --> 02:13:55,690
It's just a 1K.

3409
02:13:55,910 --> 02:13:57,850
That's code around here for tiny and overpriced.

3410
02:13:57,950 --> 02:13:59,670
The location is great and it's mine.

3411
02:13:59,870 --> 02:14:00,490
I love it.

3412
02:14:00,650 --> 02:14:02,250
When did you move out of the Ryokan?

3413
02:14:02,630 --> 02:14:04,490
The second I was old enough to sign a lease.

3414
02:14:04,830 --> 02:14:06,270
Best decision I've ever made.

3415
02:14:06,530 --> 02:14:07,650
No late night room service.

3416
02:14:07,890 --> 02:14:10,190
No annoying tourists calling up at 4 in the morning.

3417
02:14:10,190 --> 02:14:11,750
I adore that apartment.

3418
02:14:12,050 --> 02:14:12,450
Oh.

3419
02:14:13,230 --> 02:14:14,510
I wonder if it knows.

3420
02:14:15,290 --> 02:14:17,010
I'm going to get at something nice today.

3421
02:14:17,210 --> 02:14:18,470
A new doormat or something.

3422
02:14:18,970 --> 02:14:20,330
You mean so weird.

3423
02:14:20,630 --> 02:14:21,370
Oh my gosh.

3424
02:14:21,490 --> 02:14:23,110
I was talking to someone just the other night.

3425
02:14:23,930 --> 02:14:30,190
And they were saying how they knew someone that lived in like a 7 DK or something.

3426
02:14:30,630 --> 02:14:34,050
Which is like actually insane.

3427
02:14:34,490 --> 02:14:35,630
This is a cursed super chat.

3428
02:14:35,850 --> 02:14:36,990
You have been cursed by a ghost.

3429
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:40,810
If you don't repost this message to 7 group chats, a ghost mood will haunt you.

3430
02:14:41,510 --> 02:14:42,230
This week.

3431
02:14:43,170 --> 02:14:44,430
Thank you for the raid.

3432
02:14:49,940 --> 02:14:50,540
Thank you.

3433
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:50,960
Thank you.

3434
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:52,620
Yeah, it was like...

3435
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:53,300
It was...

3436
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:55,600
Like they were describing it to me and I was like...

3437
02:14:59,950 --> 02:15:00,410
I...

3438
02:15:01,050 --> 02:15:03,270
I didn't even know they were so that big.

3439
02:15:03,970 --> 02:15:05,190
I didn't even know.

3440
02:15:05,490 --> 02:15:07,790
You could get an apartment that big in Japan.

3441
02:15:08,270 --> 02:15:09,250
Ducky, thanks for the gift.

3442
02:15:12,050 --> 02:15:12,610
Uh...

3443
02:15:12,610 --> 02:15:14,250
That last picture of you is great.

3444
02:15:14,610 --> 02:15:14,970
Yeah.

3445
02:15:15,210 --> 02:15:16,090
I love that one.

3446
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:18,270
She loves that one.

3447
02:15:21,070 --> 02:15:22,610
This is a blessed super chat.

3448
02:15:22,730 --> 02:15:23,810
All curses are removed.

3449
02:15:24,630 --> 02:15:25,190
Oh...

3450
02:15:25,190 --> 02:15:26,670
Wait, but I want the curse.

3451
02:15:26,950 --> 02:15:27,490
Around.

3452
02:15:28,350 --> 02:15:28,910
Yippee!

3453
02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:33,210
It was like a 7D...

3454
02:15:33,210 --> 02:15:33,650
I think...

3455
02:15:33,650 --> 02:15:35,690
It's like 7 rooms and a kitchen.

3456
02:15:37,370 --> 02:15:37,950
And...

3457
02:15:37,950 --> 02:15:42,230
Like LDK, I think is living, dining, kitchen.

3458
02:15:43,550 --> 02:15:44,070
Dorgo!

3459
02:15:44,270 --> 02:15:45,450
Thank you so much for the 5KT.

3460
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:46,170
Thank you!

3461
02:15:47,660 --> 02:15:47,950
No.

3462
02:15:48,410 --> 02:15:48,990
7DK.

3463
02:15:49,270 --> 02:15:50,070
Not 7...

3464
02:15:50,070 --> 02:15:51,730
Not 7 0 K.

3465
02:15:52,270 --> 02:15:53,130
Like 7...

3466
02:15:53,130 --> 02:15:54,590
Like it's like 7 rooms.

3467
02:15:54,590 --> 02:15:56,030
7 rooms and then...

3468
02:15:56,030 --> 02:15:57,630
Dining and kitchen.

3469
02:15:59,810 --> 02:16:00,130
Is...

3470
02:16:05,250 --> 02:16:06,570
It wasn't my friend.

3471
02:16:06,730 --> 02:16:08,850
My friend was describing someone that they know.

3472
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:09,630
Yeah.

3473
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:11,390
7 Donkey Kongs.

3474
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:11,810
Exactly.

3475
02:16:12,490 --> 02:16:13,990
7 Donkey Kongs.

3476
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:16,010
I'll let you get back to work.

3477
02:16:16,010 --> 02:16:16,710
Okay.

3478
02:16:16,710 --> 02:16:17,290
See ya.

3479
02:16:17,410 --> 02:16:19,030
I'm not ready to do more bento.

3480
02:16:19,250 --> 02:16:20,610
I don't think my...

3481
02:16:20,610 --> 02:16:22,730
I don't think I'm mentally prepared for it.

3482
02:16:24,930 --> 02:16:25,450
Okay.

3483
02:16:26,330 --> 02:16:27,130
Well then.

3484
02:16:27,130 --> 02:16:28,610
We got that number.

3485
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:30,010
How do we call her?

3486
02:16:30,350 --> 02:16:32,130
Let's try calling...

3487
02:16:32,130 --> 02:16:33,050
Oh my gosh.

3488
02:16:33,090 --> 02:16:34,870
I always click camera instead.

3489
02:16:35,390 --> 02:16:36,010
Let's try calling...

3490
02:16:36,990 --> 02:16:38,470
Maybe George can get...

3491
02:16:38,470 --> 02:16:40,090
George is pretty good at this stuff, no?

3492
02:16:47,770 --> 02:16:48,250
Uh...

3493
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:52,630
I found a strange book about ghosts in Yumi's apartment with a note from the author.

3494
02:16:52,850 --> 02:16:53,710
What do you mean?

3495
02:16:54,110 --> 02:16:58,350
It had a dedication from the author, Savannah Woodham, to the Shimizu family.

3496
02:16:58,810 --> 02:17:01,950
But the really weird thing is, there's a chapter missing.

3497
02:17:02,350 --> 02:17:03,610
What was in the missing chapter?

3498
02:17:03,890 --> 02:17:05,050
Nope, strike that.

3499
02:17:05,270 --> 02:17:06,030
That is a dumb question.

3500
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:06,310
Yeah.

3501
02:17:06,430 --> 02:17:07,270
That's pretty strange.

3502
02:17:07,630 --> 02:17:09,910
Maybe you can find another copy of the book somewhere.

3503
02:17:09,910 --> 02:17:12,730
There's a business card with the author's number inside.

3504
02:17:12,970 --> 02:17:17,650
But more importantly, the table of contents says the missing chapter was about the Reacon.

3505
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:18,710
Weird.

3506
02:17:19,410 --> 02:17:20,130
Did you call?

3507
02:17:20,430 --> 02:17:20,630
Yeah.

3508
02:17:20,970 --> 02:17:24,310
I called Savannah, but she's got a really protective assistant.

3509
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:25,070
She's in Kyoto?

3510
02:17:25,450 --> 02:17:25,510
Yeah.

3511
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:27,610
Apparently she's in Kyoto now.

3512
02:17:27,650 --> 02:17:28,050
How do you know that?

3513
02:17:28,050 --> 02:17:29,830
Covering the expo for some tech magazine.

3514
02:17:30,110 --> 02:17:30,590
Wait, how do you know that?

3515
02:17:30,590 --> 02:17:31,770
So she's pretty busy.

3516
02:17:32,110 --> 02:17:36,850
If I could get past her assistant, I could finally figure out what this whole book is about.

3517
02:17:37,330 --> 02:17:39,530
Wait, so this guy is at the expo?

3518
02:17:39,530 --> 02:17:40,510
Pretty sure.

3519
02:17:41,230 --> 02:17:42,110
Then we've got this one.

3520
02:17:42,350 --> 02:17:42,470
See?

3521
02:17:43,010 --> 02:17:43,190
We do?

3522
02:17:43,770 --> 02:17:43,910
Yup.

3523
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:48,050
We're going to find them, and you're going to flirt up a distraction.

3524
02:17:48,510 --> 02:17:49,270
I am?

3525
02:17:49,890 --> 02:17:51,210
Yes, you are.

3526
02:17:51,410 --> 02:17:54,610
I think the assistant only mentioned the expo.

3527
02:17:54,750 --> 02:17:56,270
But he did not say kill them.

3528
02:17:56,490 --> 02:17:56,690
What?

3529
02:17:56,690 --> 02:17:56,810
What?

3530
02:17:58,090 --> 02:17:58,850
What?

3531
02:18:07,710 --> 02:18:08,350
Okay.

3532
02:18:09,010 --> 02:18:10,010
And then also this one.

3533
02:18:10,010 --> 02:18:12,930
I think there's something pretty strange about Rintaro.

3534
02:18:13,390 --> 02:18:13,930
Yeah.

3535
02:18:14,310 --> 02:18:17,270
The way Yumi tells it, he's about as weird as they come.

3536
02:18:17,650 --> 02:18:20,210
Do you think he could be behind what's going on?

3537
02:18:20,550 --> 02:18:21,790
Hard to say for sure.

3538
02:18:22,210 --> 02:18:26,990
Well, he may be strange, but sometimes strange just means... strange.

3539
02:18:29,770 --> 02:18:32,430
I was hoping to talk for longer so I could snack.

3540
02:18:32,490 --> 02:18:33,190
I'll talk to you later.

3541
02:18:33,610 --> 02:18:33,790
Bye!

3542
02:18:34,870 --> 02:18:35,350
Okay.

3543
02:18:35,630 --> 02:18:35,990
Cool.

3544
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:37,350
They're going to flirt with that guy.

3545
02:18:38,230 --> 02:18:39,810
Probably tell me about it tomorrow.

3546
02:18:43,050 --> 02:18:44,430
Where do we go home?

3547
02:18:45,490 --> 02:18:45,970
Misawa.

3548
02:18:46,970 --> 02:18:47,370
Okay.

3549
02:18:47,370 --> 02:18:47,450
Yeah.

3550
02:18:48,530 --> 02:18:49,570
I think that's all we...

3551
02:18:49,570 --> 02:18:50,350
Oh wait, what is this?

3552
02:18:50,910 --> 02:18:52,050
This looks important.

3553
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:53,490
I better hang on to it.

3554
02:18:57,330 --> 02:18:57,810
Oh.

3555
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:03,620
No way.

3556
02:19:03,900 --> 02:19:05,620
I just saw that just now.

3557
02:19:06,460 --> 02:19:11,040
Puzzle boxes have been bewildering buyers since the late Edo period over a hundred years ago.

3558
02:19:11,220 --> 02:19:17,620
These beautifully crafted boxes are both a joy to look at and a challenge to solve.

3559
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:21,900
Traditionally requiring four to sixty-six moves before the lid can be removed.

3560
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:26,380
To open, pieces of the box are slid in a specific sequence.

3561
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:31,800
Unlocking hidden catches after correct moves.

3562
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:36,080
Once the sequence is complete, the lid will open, revealing the hidden compartment within.

3563
02:19:43,390 --> 02:19:44,850
So we totally...

3564
02:19:44,850 --> 02:19:45,930
I'm totally a genius.

3565
02:19:46,130 --> 02:19:47,230
I did not need that at all.

3566
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:51,690
Yeah, it also didn't really even explain it.

3567
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:56,200
What time is it?

3568
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:56,480
Can we...

3569
02:19:56,480 --> 02:19:57,760
You think the grandma's still around?

3570
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:00,140
Wait, she might be.

3571
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:01,680
We might be able to go...

3572
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:02,720
Oh my goodness.

3573
02:20:03,080 --> 02:20:03,800
Oh my goodness.

3574
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:06,100
If it's from Yumi...

3575
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:07,080
I got...

3576
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:07,580
Ew.

3577
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:11,720
Wait, it's not from anybody.

3578
02:20:20,250 --> 02:20:20,650
Uh...

3579
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:24,760
Okay.

3580
02:20:29,570 --> 02:20:30,930
Nice, we can talk to grandma.

3581
02:20:31,110 --> 02:20:31,970
Hello, Nancy-san.

3582
02:20:32,230 --> 02:20:33,370
I need to know.

3583
02:20:33,550 --> 02:20:35,390
Do you believe the Ria Khan is haunted?

3584
02:20:35,830 --> 02:20:37,030
Yes, Nancy-san.

3585
02:20:37,810 --> 02:20:40,070
This isn't a trick someone is doing.

3586
02:20:40,070 --> 02:20:41,810
Wait, then why did she gaslight us earlier?

3587
02:20:42,230 --> 02:20:42,430
Kasumi.

3588
02:20:42,430 --> 02:20:43,370
She's still here.

3589
02:20:43,970 --> 02:20:45,230
I can feel it.

3590
02:20:45,630 --> 02:20:46,490
She's trapped.

3591
02:20:46,810 --> 02:20:47,710
And she's scared.

3592
02:20:48,830 --> 02:20:49,350
And...

3593
02:20:49,350 --> 02:20:50,630
She's angry.

3594
02:20:51,010 --> 02:20:51,510
Angry.

3595
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:53,270
Do you really believe that?

3596
02:20:53,410 --> 02:20:53,730
Angry.

3597
02:20:53,730 --> 02:20:53,850
Angry.

3598
02:20:53,850 --> 02:20:59,730
When I was a girl, the most beautiful sparrow from the garden flew into my room.

3599
02:21:00,330 --> 02:21:06,550
I had been trying to lure it in with seeds I'd stolen from the gardens for weeks.

3600
02:21:06,550 --> 02:21:12,010
At first, I was so excited to have her in my room.

3601
02:21:12,570 --> 02:21:14,110
But not for long.

3602
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:16,990
She couldn't find her way back out.

3603
02:21:17,610 --> 02:21:19,750
She became very scared.

3604
02:21:20,390 --> 02:21:23,670
Threw herself into the walls in a panic.

3605
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:24,650
Oh my god.

3606
02:21:24,850 --> 02:21:26,870
I was so worried she would die.

3607
02:21:26,870 --> 02:21:31,130
She was so smart and so frightened.

3608
02:21:31,950 --> 02:21:38,530
I opened the windows wide and snuck out of the room to let her calm down.

3609
02:21:38,870 --> 02:21:40,010
An hour passed.

3610
02:21:40,010 --> 02:21:41,010
You should free her!

3611
02:21:41,450 --> 02:21:42,050
Then two...

3612
02:21:42,870 --> 02:21:43,490
Three...

3613
02:21:43,490 --> 02:21:47,610
I'd open the door and still she'd be there.

3614
02:21:47,610 --> 02:21:54,250
Crashing into the glass, trying so desperately to get me.

3615
02:21:54,370 --> 02:21:55,830
Did she get out?

3616
02:21:56,270 --> 02:21:58,570
Cosme is still here.

3617
02:21:58,730 --> 02:22:01,130
I must help her.

3618
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:05,010
Okay, Grandma.

3619
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:06,490
Oh!

3620
02:22:06,710 --> 02:22:07,270
Oh!

3621
02:22:07,470 --> 02:22:08,030
Oh!

3622
02:22:08,530 --> 02:22:10,010
Oh my god!

3623
02:22:10,370 --> 02:22:10,990
Oh, sorry.

3624
02:22:14,870 --> 02:22:16,270
Yes, Grandma?

3625
02:22:19,910 --> 02:22:20,770
I'm sorry.

3626
02:22:21,010 --> 02:22:22,750
I cannot talk right now.

3627
02:22:22,830 --> 02:22:23,550
She's got a nap.

3628
02:22:23,790 --> 02:22:23,910
Okay.

3629
02:22:24,270 --> 02:22:25,410
No, I thought the...

3630
02:22:25,890 --> 02:22:27,690
I think the game, like...

3631
02:22:28,430 --> 02:22:30,690
I think the game had a bit of a...

3632
02:22:31,650 --> 02:22:33,170
Yeah, so there's nothing in here.

3633
02:22:34,550 --> 02:22:36,390
I don't know...

3634
02:22:36,390 --> 02:22:37,090
Oh!

3635
02:22:37,290 --> 02:22:38,350
We can open this now!

3636
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:40,370
I can't take this if Dekai is here.

3637
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:42,190
Ah, but she's asleep!

3638
02:22:42,630 --> 02:22:43,530
Oh my gosh, wait.

3639
02:22:43,910 --> 02:22:45,050
I can't take this if Dekai is here.

3640
02:22:45,050 --> 02:22:46,750
So now we can get that.

3641
02:22:47,190 --> 02:22:48,510
But how do we get it?

3642
02:22:50,370 --> 02:22:51,750
How do we get it?

3643
02:22:58,230 --> 02:22:58,710
Hmm...

3644
02:22:58,710 --> 02:22:59,450
I don't think the door...

3645
02:22:59,450 --> 02:23:01,310
Cos we try and the door doesn't open it.

3646
02:23:04,730 --> 02:23:05,210
Hmm...

3647
02:23:05,210 --> 02:23:06,610
Huh, huh, huh, huh.

3648
02:23:08,270 --> 02:23:09,270
Knock her out.

3649
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:09,590
Oh, oh.

3650
02:23:10,190 --> 02:23:10,650
Hi!

3651
02:23:12,810 --> 02:23:13,710
I don't...

3652
02:23:14,090 --> 02:23:14,630
Hold on.

3653
02:23:15,330 --> 02:23:18,470
I'll save before I ask you any of these questions.

3654
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:19,850
Okay, see ya!

3655
02:23:19,850 --> 02:23:19,970
Hi!

3656
02:23:20,250 --> 02:23:22,510
Why does Dekai think your mother's ghost...

3657
02:23:22,510 --> 02:23:22,970
Stop.

3658
02:23:23,250 --> 02:23:24,670
I don't indulge her.

3659
02:23:24,790 --> 02:23:26,350
And don't you do it either.

3660
02:23:26,930 --> 02:23:28,430
So, you don't believe it?

3661
02:23:28,570 --> 02:23:30,570
That's my mother you're talking about, Nancy.

3662
02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:31,950
You forget that.

3663
02:23:31,950 --> 02:23:33,650
Yeah, that's actually so...

3664
02:23:33,650 --> 02:23:34,270
So...

3665
02:23:34,270 --> 02:23:35,390
I'll stop bugging you now.

3666
02:23:35,730 --> 02:23:35,990
That's so...

3667
02:23:35,990 --> 02:23:36,410
Okay, see ya!

3668
02:23:36,730 --> 02:23:37,350
That's so...

3669
02:23:37,350 --> 02:23:38,210
Nancy, come on!

3670
02:23:38,850 --> 02:23:39,430
Oh.

3671
02:23:40,510 --> 02:23:41,310
Mushy-mushy.

3672
02:23:42,330 --> 02:23:45,030
Nancy, operation distract Logan is a go.

3673
02:23:45,210 --> 02:23:45,730
Call Savannah.

3674
02:23:46,030 --> 02:23:46,370
Gotta go.

3675
02:23:46,370 --> 02:23:47,550
Oh, oh.

3676
02:23:47,750 --> 02:23:47,990
Thank you.

3677
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:48,390
Thank you.

3678
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:49,070
Oh, oh.

3679
02:23:49,330 --> 02:23:49,450
Call.

3680
02:23:49,970 --> 02:23:50,110
Call.

3681
02:23:54,570 --> 02:23:55,390
Rude Nancy.

3682
02:23:55,870 --> 02:23:55,930
Hello.

3683
02:23:55,930 --> 02:23:56,050
Hi.

3684
02:23:56,270 --> 02:23:57,390
Is this Savannah Woodham?

3685
02:23:57,550 --> 02:23:58,250
Let me guess.

3686
02:23:58,530 --> 02:24:00,890
You're that Nancy girl who's been driving my...

3687
02:24:00,890 --> 02:24:01,430
Oh, she's Southern!

3688
02:24:03,630 --> 02:24:06,410
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.

3689
02:24:06,410 --> 02:24:06,510
She's real Southern.

3690
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:07,510
I would.

3691
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:08,550
She's a Georgia girl.

3692
02:24:08,570 --> 02:24:11,250
Now tell me what's so important that y'all ruin my perfectly good assistant.

3693
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:15,370
Since y'all been calling around, talking to him's been like talking to a rock.

3694
02:24:15,370 --> 02:24:17,190
A rock that I pay too much money.

3695
02:24:17,450 --> 02:24:19,670
I'm staying at the Ryukon Hiei.

3696
02:24:19,950 --> 02:24:22,410
Something really strange is going on here.

3697
02:24:22,910 --> 02:24:23,930
Don't tell me a lie now.

3698
02:24:24,150 --> 02:24:24,650
This a joke?

3699
02:24:24,950 --> 02:24:26,190
No, I promise.

3700
02:24:26,470 --> 02:24:27,130
It's the truth.

3701
02:24:27,470 --> 02:24:28,730
I saw your book.

3702
02:24:28,970 --> 02:24:30,510
I thought maybe you could help.

3703
02:24:30,890 --> 02:24:37,850
Honey, whoever you are, my best advice to you is to pack your bags and head back to wherever it is y'all come from.

3704
02:24:38,170 --> 02:24:41,570
I'm not leaving until I figure out what's really going on here.

3705
02:24:41,570 --> 02:24:42,310
Don't tell me a lie now.

3706
02:24:42,310 --> 02:24:45,370
Is there gonna be anything I can say that'll change your mind now?

3707
02:24:45,830 --> 02:24:46,170
No.

3708
02:24:46,470 --> 02:24:49,110
I'm going to get to the bottom of this with or without you.

3709
02:24:49,710 --> 02:24:51,590
But I could really use your help.

3710
02:24:51,870 --> 02:24:51,910
Yeah.

3711
02:24:52,390 --> 02:24:54,850
I've been a lot of places that say they haunt it.

3712
02:24:55,530 --> 02:24:59,150
But none fit the ticket like that spooky old Ryukon Hiei.

3713
02:24:59,570 --> 02:25:00,290
Ryukon Hiei.

3714
02:25:00,290 --> 02:25:03,490
I never got to finish up a chapter on the Ryukon like I was supposed to.

3715
02:25:04,010 --> 02:25:05,450
Between us girls, I'm glad that.

3716
02:25:05,450 --> 02:25:06,130
The Ryukon.

3717
02:25:06,130 --> 02:25:06,510
I'm glad that.

3718
02:25:07,190 --> 02:25:08,290
You getting much out of the family?

3719
02:25:08,810 --> 02:25:10,030
Nothing too useful.

3720
02:25:10,650 --> 02:25:11,030
Uh huh.

3721
02:25:11,690 --> 02:25:12,270
Tell you what.

3722
02:25:12,970 --> 02:25:16,410
You end up following through with that bad idea y'all's to stay at the Ryukon?

3723
02:25:17,050 --> 02:25:18,490
And I'll see what help I can provide.

3724
02:25:18,610 --> 02:25:19,050
But Nancy?

3725
02:25:19,370 --> 02:25:20,050
What's that?

3726
02:25:20,430 --> 02:25:21,530
Y'all be careful there now.

3727
02:25:21,710 --> 02:25:22,450
You understand me?

3728
02:25:22,630 --> 02:25:23,290
I will.

3729
02:25:25,410 --> 02:25:26,430
Oh my gosh.

3730
02:25:26,610 --> 02:25:27,290
Oh my gosh.

3731
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:29,650
We could get the full lore dump here.

3732
02:25:29,910 --> 02:25:30,710
Holy cow.

3733
02:25:31,050 --> 02:25:31,490
Okay.

3734
02:25:34,390 --> 02:25:38,350
We're unlocking so many different ways to say the Ryukon.

3735
02:25:39,270 --> 02:25:39,830
Okay.

3736
02:25:40,550 --> 02:25:41,110
Let's...

3737
02:25:41,110 --> 02:25:43,770
I think I ran across a trick mirror here.

3738
02:25:44,070 --> 02:25:44,650
Did it break?

3739
02:25:45,150 --> 02:25:45,570
Yeah.

3740
02:25:45,910 --> 02:25:46,670
How did you know?

3741
02:25:47,150 --> 02:25:48,790
That's how you know it's a trick.

3742
02:25:49,350 --> 02:25:53,270
Y'all know what the main difference between truth and illusion is in my line of work?

3743
02:25:53,970 --> 02:25:54,850
What's that?

3744
02:25:55,170 --> 02:25:55,610
Time.

3745
02:25:55,830 --> 02:25:59,090
An illusion can only last so long before it gives up its secrets.

3746
02:25:59,590 --> 02:26:02,310
Now, I don't know exactly how that mill was fixed.

3747
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:07,670
But the fact that it broke means that whoever rigged it, knew it if you examined it enough, you'd figure it out.

3748
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:11,350
So, it was broken, so I couldn't figure out how it was faked.

3749
02:26:11,650 --> 02:26:11,870
No.

3750
02:26:12,170 --> 02:26:12,190
Exactly.

3751
02:26:12,830 --> 02:26:15,310
That is, if it was a trick.

3752
02:26:16,070 --> 02:26:21,270
Nancy, I can tell you how things might be faked, but I can't tell you if they were faked.

3753
02:26:21,630 --> 02:26:22,310
So true.

3754
02:26:22,310 --> 02:26:26,130
Someone's got to stand there and know how the room feels when these things happen.

3755
02:26:27,170 --> 02:26:32,030
No, but didn't we read the thing that said that if you did the mirror trick, it would shatter it?

3756
02:26:32,810 --> 02:26:35,150
Because that was like part of the illusion?

3757
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:36,190
Or whatever?

3758
02:26:37,450 --> 02:26:37,670
Hmm.

3759
02:26:38,890 --> 02:26:39,410
Oh gosh.

3760
02:26:40,170 --> 02:26:41,870
What is a yurei?

3761
02:26:42,090 --> 02:26:45,390
It's a vengeful spirit that never knew justice here on the earth.

3762
02:26:45,870 --> 02:26:46,330
Oh!

3763
02:26:46,330 --> 02:26:48,290
They're said to be the spirits of those who've been wronged.

3764
02:26:48,390 --> 02:26:50,930
And they're caught up in the worst moment you can imagine.

3765
02:26:51,470 --> 02:26:54,450
They're very angry and very, very dangerous.

3766
02:26:55,170 --> 02:26:58,570
If that's what you're dealing with there, you best be very careful.

3767
02:26:58,570 --> 02:26:59,050
Hahaha.

3768
02:26:59,970 --> 02:27:00,370
Hahahaha.

3769
02:27:01,190 --> 02:27:01,730
Hahahaha.

3770
02:27:02,290 --> 02:27:02,530
Hahahaha.

3771
02:27:04,190 --> 02:27:04,510
Hahahaha.

3772
02:27:04,510 --> 02:27:04,570
Hahahaha.

3773
02:27:06,830 --> 02:27:09,330
What's the story with your assistant, Logan?

3774
02:27:09,950 --> 02:27:11,690
He's like my own little Georgia Bulldog.

3775
02:27:12,030 --> 02:27:13,950
He can be a little aggressive sometimes.

3776
02:27:14,330 --> 02:27:16,830
A little dopey at others, but always loyal.

3777
02:27:16,830 --> 02:27:19,510
He's one of the good ones when you get right down to it.

3778
02:27:19,730 --> 02:27:21,470
How long has he been working for you?

3779
02:27:21,470 --> 02:27:21,690
I don't really care about Logan.

3780
02:27:21,930 --> 02:27:22,590
Not long now.

3781
02:27:23,050 --> 02:27:25,650
He started right after I switched my focus to tech reporting.

3782
02:27:26,190 --> 02:27:27,890
Why did you change careers?

3783
02:27:28,590 --> 02:27:30,170
It's a long story, but...

3784
02:27:30,970 --> 02:27:33,070
Chasing's not the safest career there is.

3785
02:27:33,490 --> 02:27:34,750
Ain't nothing shocking in that.

3786
02:27:35,350 --> 02:27:38,090
Oh, she got spooked out of it doing it.

3787
02:27:38,790 --> 02:27:39,090
Ooh.

3788
02:27:40,650 --> 02:27:42,250
She's a bulldog.

3789
02:27:42,670 --> 02:27:43,770
A bulldog.

3790
02:27:47,390 --> 02:27:47,830
Um...

3791
02:27:47,830 --> 02:27:48,150
Oh!

3792
02:27:48,870 --> 02:27:50,270
Can you translate me in...

3793
02:27:50,270 --> 02:27:51,510
Wait, she can speak Japanese?

3794
02:27:51,990 --> 02:27:53,950
Can you help me translate an article I found?

3795
02:27:54,290 --> 02:27:55,930
No one else is willing to.

3796
02:27:56,370 --> 02:27:56,790
Sure.

3797
02:27:57,190 --> 02:28:00,290
Leave it at the cannon and I'll have Logan swing by to pick it up.

3798
02:28:00,430 --> 02:28:00,970
Uh-oh.

3799
02:28:01,350 --> 02:28:02,310
Wait, but they're gonna know.

3800
02:28:02,730 --> 02:28:04,490
Wait, we'll put it in the envelope.

3801
02:28:04,610 --> 02:28:05,230
We'll put it in the envelope.

3802
02:28:05,370 --> 02:28:08,770
I saw a really creepy shadowy figure on my balcony.

3803
02:28:09,150 --> 02:28:11,010
Do you think that could be faked?

3804
02:28:11,490 --> 02:28:11,930
Of course.

3805
02:28:12,330 --> 02:28:13,470
Ain't nothing harder than that.

3806
02:28:13,970 --> 02:28:14,070
Yeah?

3807
02:28:15,090 --> 02:28:16,710
It's as easy as shadow puppets.

3808
02:28:17,350 --> 02:28:19,190
I'm turning into Nancy Drew!

3809
02:28:19,870 --> 02:28:23,930
In my experience, people like scaring people with shadows a lot more than ghosts do.

3810
02:28:24,010 --> 02:28:24,570
Oh my god.

3811
02:28:24,690 --> 02:28:29,190
The way I see it, if it's something a person could plausibly do, then there's a person behind it.

3812
02:28:29,190 --> 02:28:34,170
If it's something a person can't do that's scaring you, well, y'all don't need me to finish that sentence.

3813
02:28:34,470 --> 02:28:34,730
No!

3814
02:28:37,430 --> 02:28:39,890
If it's something a person can't do that's scaring you.

3815
02:28:40,110 --> 02:28:41,050
Oh, freaky.

3816
02:28:41,670 --> 02:28:42,470
Okay, just a few more.

3817
02:28:42,730 --> 02:28:45,790
Can you tell me about the certificate you gave the Shimizu family?

3818
02:28:45,790 --> 02:28:47,730
Oh yeah, that.

3819
02:28:48,650 --> 02:28:53,410
Now, before you go thinking I'm some sort of charlatan, I don't normally do things like that.

3820
02:28:53,770 --> 02:28:57,670
In fact, I had those made up to give to kids who were feeling too scared to go to sleep at night.

3821
02:28:57,950 --> 02:28:59,570
Why did you leave one here?

3822
02:28:59,830 --> 02:29:01,870
I felt like I should leave them something.

3823
02:29:02,350 --> 02:29:05,570
I don't usually leave a place without knowing what's really going on there.

3824
02:29:06,610 --> 02:29:09,450
Honestly, I felt so bad about the whole situation.

3825
02:29:10,330 --> 02:29:12,950
That doesn't seem very reassuring.

3826
02:29:14,310 --> 02:29:16,370
So you just were like, here's a...

3827
02:29:17,330 --> 02:29:18,630
Here's a piece of paper!

3828
02:29:19,050 --> 02:29:19,550
What?

3829
02:29:19,910 --> 02:29:21,530
Why would you do...

3830
02:29:21,530 --> 02:29:21,730
What?

3831
02:29:22,090 --> 02:29:23,730
What is the logic here?

3832
02:29:24,190 --> 02:29:25,210
Miss Savannah.

3833
02:29:25,830 --> 02:29:27,730
What happened that made you give up ghost hunting?

3834
02:29:28,290 --> 02:29:29,730
It wasn't just one thing.

3835
02:29:29,950 --> 02:29:31,310
It was a lot of things, really.

3836
02:29:31,770 --> 02:29:33,590
My daddy used to tell me, sugar...

3837
02:29:33,590 --> 02:29:34,690
Ug woman, am I right now?

3838
02:29:34,690 --> 02:29:36,770
Y 'all be careful what you go looking for in that big old world.

3839
02:29:37,110 --> 02:29:38,690
Chances are, you gonna find it.

3840
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:40,530
What did you end up finding?

3841
02:29:40,870 --> 02:29:42,210
It ain't what I found, honey.

3842
02:29:42,490 --> 02:29:43,650
It's what found me.

3843
02:29:44,010 --> 02:29:44,890
What do you mean?

3844
02:29:45,510 --> 02:29:48,210
Exactly what I said, and that's the last you're getting out of me on the topic.

3845
02:29:48,870 --> 02:29:50,050
You got anything else you need?

3846
02:29:50,150 --> 02:29:51,730
God, Nancy is so nosy!

3847
02:29:52,590 --> 02:29:54,470
Do you know where I can get a copy of your book?

3848
02:29:55,010 --> 02:29:58,830
I'm guessing you're looking for the ghost hunting of the world, but I can't help you there.

3849
02:29:59,170 --> 02:30:00,550
I'm out of copies myself.

3850
02:30:00,850 --> 02:30:03,070
To be honest, Nancy, I don't mind helping you.

3851
02:30:03,770 --> 02:30:07,030
But this whole ghost thing is a phase I'd sooner put behind me.

3852
02:30:07,750 --> 02:30:08,590
Why is that?

3853
02:30:08,950 --> 02:30:09,250
Oh my god, we...

3854
02:30:09,250 --> 02:30:10,770
Now, don't y'all worry about that now.

3855
02:30:10,930 --> 02:30:12,890
She clearly does not want to talk about it.

3856
02:30:12,930 --> 02:30:14,090
There must be some reason.

3857
02:30:14,330 --> 02:30:14,610
Oh my god.

3858
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:16,330
I understand you were pretty well known.

3859
02:30:17,250 --> 02:30:18,470
Put it this way, Nancy.

3860
02:30:19,030 --> 02:30:23,150
There are some jobs where being well known makes for a dangerous life.

3861
02:30:23,770 --> 02:30:26,370
Sometimes it's, uh, smart to move on.

3862
02:30:26,370 --> 02:30:26,470
Aw.

3863
02:30:28,310 --> 02:30:29,310
That's so scary.

3864
02:30:29,790 --> 02:30:30,490
Oh my god.

3865
02:30:31,030 --> 02:30:33,230
Savannah has the mafia going after her.

3866
02:30:33,530 --> 02:30:34,710
What is happening?

3867
02:30:35,010 --> 02:30:35,950
I'll talk to you later.

3868
02:30:36,330 --> 02:30:37,010
Bye bye, Nancy.

3869
02:30:37,270 --> 02:30:38,730
Yeah, Nancy does not know bound.

3870
02:30:39,230 --> 02:30:40,250
Oh my god.

3871
02:30:44,710 --> 02:30:45,250
Oh!

3872
02:30:45,770 --> 02:30:47,230
This must be...

3873
02:30:47,230 --> 02:30:49,950
This must be, uh, George.

3874
02:30:49,950 --> 02:30:51,450
And this must be Bess.

3875
02:30:51,950 --> 02:30:53,470
Since we had...

3876
02:30:54,590 --> 02:30:55,990
This is George.

3877
02:30:57,070 --> 02:30:58,050
I guess.

3878
02:30:59,150 --> 02:30:59,890
Okay.

3879
02:31:01,170 --> 02:31:01,910
Alright.

3880
02:31:02,110 --> 02:31:05,330
Let's go, um, seal up this article.

3881
02:31:07,130 --> 02:31:07,870
Oh!

3882
02:31:08,470 --> 02:31:08,730
Ew!

3883
02:31:08,730 --> 02:31:09,410
Ew!

3884
02:31:09,450 --> 02:31:13,390
It looks like whoever left those footprints walked right through the wall.

3885
02:31:13,670 --> 02:31:15,530
Nancy, this slides open.

3886
02:31:18,410 --> 02:31:19,250
Ew!

3887
02:31:21,150 --> 02:31:22,310
Are they in my closet?

3888
02:31:22,530 --> 02:31:22,750
No.

3889
02:31:24,990 --> 02:31:25,490
Ew!

3890
02:31:29,750 --> 02:31:31,010
She's so...

3891
02:31:32,590 --> 02:31:33,430
Okay.

3892
02:31:34,330 --> 02:31:36,550
And then the article.

3893
02:31:37,030 --> 02:31:37,570
To Logan.

3894
02:31:37,810 --> 02:31:38,050
Nice.

3895
02:31:39,230 --> 02:31:39,770
Okay.

3896
02:31:43,110 --> 02:31:45,770
Now we can't investigate it yet, so...

3897
02:31:45,770 --> 02:31:46,890
Oh, that's gross!

3898
02:31:47,930 --> 02:31:49,150
Who's in my room?

3899
02:31:51,370 --> 02:31:52,610
They got big feet.

3900
02:31:53,690 --> 02:31:56,150
You know what they say about ghosts with big feet.

3901
02:31:59,330 --> 02:32:00,530
Oh, sorry mom.

3902
02:32:02,090 --> 02:32:02,590
Hi.

3903
02:32:03,070 --> 02:32:03,610
Hi.

3904
02:32:05,530 --> 02:32:06,070
Uh...

3905
02:32:06,070 --> 02:32:07,790
Can I leave this here to be picked up?

3906
02:32:07,790 --> 02:32:08,150
Yes.

3907
02:32:10,330 --> 02:32:10,930
Thanks.

3908
02:32:11,270 --> 02:32:11,870
Thanks.

3909
02:32:13,010 --> 02:32:15,250
Is the symbol on the door the same as the card key?

3910
02:32:16,770 --> 02:32:17,070
Well...

3911
02:32:17,370 --> 02:32:19,770
It seems like you and Rentaro were pretty close.

3912
02:32:20,290 --> 02:32:20,590
Yes.

3913
02:32:20,870 --> 02:32:22,010
We grew up together.

3914
02:32:22,410 --> 02:32:25,730
I have a few memories before Rentaro, but not many.

3915
02:32:25,730 --> 02:32:27,930
How long have you two been dating?

3916
02:32:28,530 --> 02:32:29,310
I don't even know.

3917
02:32:29,830 --> 02:32:31,170
A long time.

3918
02:32:31,510 --> 02:32:31,610
Oh.

3919
02:32:32,310 --> 02:32:33,730
You sound a little frustrated.

3920
02:32:34,970 --> 02:32:37,670
Sometimes it's hard not to be with Rentaro.

3921
02:32:37,870 --> 02:32:38,530
What do you mean by that?

3922
02:32:38,530 --> 02:32:39,730
What do you mean?

3923
02:32:40,410 --> 02:32:40,810
Never mind.

3924
02:32:41,030 --> 02:32:42,670
I shouldn't be bothering you with this.

3925
02:32:42,790 --> 02:32:43,730
Oh, it's not a...

3926
02:32:43,730 --> 02:32:44,170
It's not a bother.

3927
02:32:44,370 --> 02:32:44,770
Nancy Drew!

3928
02:32:45,190 --> 02:32:45,810
It's just that...

3929
02:32:45,810 --> 02:32:50,170
When he gets it in his mind that he wants something, there's just no stopping him.

3930
02:32:50,850 --> 02:32:52,990
He's been pressuring me to leave here.

3931
02:32:53,550 --> 02:32:54,350
Why is that?

3932
02:32:54,350 --> 02:32:59,070
He keeps saying it'll be good for me, but really, he's just being selfish.

3933
02:33:00,090 --> 02:33:00,850
I think.

3934
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:03,010
I really don't know.

3935
02:33:03,090 --> 02:33:05,190
I think he's trying to scare her out of here.

3936
02:33:05,210 --> 02:33:07,970
He can be so sweet sometimes, and other times it's like there's only him in the world.

3937
02:33:09,210 --> 02:33:11,430
I think he's trying to scare her out of here.

3938
02:33:11,550 --> 02:33:12,230
I should go.

3939
02:33:12,430 --> 02:33:13,490
I'll talk to you later.

3940
02:33:13,870 --> 02:33:14,470
See you later.

3941
02:33:16,810 --> 02:33:17,290
Okay.

3942
02:33:18,470 --> 02:33:19,550
Um, let's see.

3943
02:33:20,270 --> 02:33:21,910
Oh, I think you're right.

3944
02:33:21,910 --> 02:33:23,430
I think it is the same card.

3945
02:33:23,430 --> 02:33:26,170
Wait, are we not gonna mention the feet in...

3946
02:33:26,170 --> 02:33:27,430
In our...

3947
02:33:28,130 --> 02:33:29,010
In our room?

3948
02:33:29,130 --> 02:33:29,370
Logan here.

3949
02:33:29,630 --> 02:33:29,950
Yes?

3950
02:33:30,470 --> 02:33:30,910
Alright.

3951
02:33:31,470 --> 02:33:34,070
Savannah wants me to translate that article for you.

3952
02:33:34,190 --> 02:33:34,470
Oh, Logan.

3953
02:33:34,470 --> 02:33:40,250
I don't know what it is you said to her, but whatever you did to get her to talk about that paranormal garbage, you need to knock it off.

3954
02:33:40,690 --> 02:33:42,410
I can't promise that.

3955
02:33:42,810 --> 02:33:44,530
You really don't get it, do you?

3956
02:33:44,850 --> 02:33:47,850
This ghost stuff isn't a joke, especially not to her.

3957
02:33:47,850 --> 02:33:58,630
Since I'm the one stuck picking up the pieces after she gets too wrapped up in one of her cases, I'm telling you, leave it alone for her's sake and yours.

3958
02:33:58,970 --> 02:33:59,150
Okay.

3959
02:34:00,030 --> 02:34:01,530
What happened to Savannah?

3960
02:34:01,930 --> 02:34:04,390
Why doesn't she work with paranormal cases anymore?

3961
02:34:05,210 --> 02:34:07,390
It's not something she likes to talk about.

3962
02:34:07,570 --> 02:34:10,310
I gathered that, but can you tell me...

3963
02:34:10,310 --> 02:34:11,310
But you, yeah, you can talk about it.

3964
02:34:11,310 --> 02:34:15,670
When we're traveling, I spend weeks with her just touring on buses, long plane flights, we talk a lot.

3965
02:34:16,090 --> 02:34:18,190
I know everything about her childhood.

3966
02:34:18,670 --> 02:34:20,770
Her best friend's dog's name from when she was five.

3967
02:34:20,770 --> 02:34:22,370
Okay, this is not about the ghost.

3968
02:34:22,950 --> 02:34:24,110
She's very chatty.

3969
02:34:24,150 --> 02:34:26,330
Then, what has she told you about?

3970
02:34:26,990 --> 02:34:27,270
Nothing.

3971
02:34:27,590 --> 02:34:28,550
Not a single word.

3972
02:34:29,390 --> 02:34:33,230
I've asked, and when I do, she just goes quiet and excuses herself.

3973
02:34:33,810 --> 02:34:37,850
She's never told me to stop bugging her about it, but I can tell that she wants to.

3974
02:34:38,390 --> 02:34:41,050
That's why I don't want you bothering her about it either.

3975
02:34:41,350 --> 02:34:45,230
Whatever happened when she was writing the second ghost book, it really got to her.

3976
02:34:45,270 --> 02:34:45,970
That's spooky.

3977
02:34:46,150 --> 02:34:47,270
Second ghost book?

3978
02:34:47,690 --> 02:34:48,990
Wasn't supposed to mention that.

3979
02:34:48,990 --> 02:34:49,190
Whoop!

3980
02:34:49,190 --> 02:34:53,270
It's a secret, and it's not done, so don't think you're going to get your hands on it.

3981
02:34:53,470 --> 02:34:55,550
I don't even know if she still has the manuscript.

3982
02:34:56,410 --> 02:35:00,190
She had me tell her publisher she burned it, but I don't know if that's the truth.

3983
02:35:00,390 --> 02:35:00,650
Oh!

3984
02:35:03,130 --> 02:35:03,530
Interesting.

3985
02:35:06,250 --> 02:35:07,610
Interesting, interesting, interesting.

3986
02:35:08,390 --> 02:35:09,010
Ha ha ha!

3987
02:35:09,990 --> 02:35:11,770
Um, let's see what the article says.

3988
02:35:11,770 --> 02:35:13,270
Have you finished translating the article yet?

3989
02:35:13,530 --> 02:35:14,130
Just about.

3990
02:35:14,310 --> 02:35:16,010
I'll have it sent to you as soon as I finish.

3991
02:35:16,250 --> 02:35:17,170
Okay, thank ya!

3992
02:35:17,170 --> 02:35:17,350
Wow.

3993
02:35:17,870 --> 02:35:20,330
I really need a copy of Savannah's book.

3994
02:35:20,590 --> 02:35:21,350
Can you help me?

3995
02:35:21,850 --> 02:35:22,190
Sure!

3996
02:35:22,770 --> 02:35:24,050
Bookstores are a great start.

3997
02:35:24,290 --> 02:35:25,530
Or the internet is helpful.

3998
02:35:25,750 --> 02:35:28,350
But I'm really more of a brick and mortar person, honestly.

3999
02:35:28,670 --> 02:35:29,610
Oh, you need a book?

4000
02:35:29,730 --> 02:35:30,690
Go to the bookstore!

4001
02:35:31,130 --> 02:35:32,190
The book's on tape route.

4002
02:35:32,790 --> 02:35:36,230
TV's Ralston Pauper's does an excellent job with the text.

4003
02:35:36,530 --> 02:35:37,650
Really makes it come alive.

4004
02:35:37,990 --> 02:35:40,910
No, I meant, could you send me a copy?

4005
02:35:40,910 --> 02:35:41,750
Oh!

4006
02:35:42,750 --> 02:35:43,230
Nope.

4007
02:35:43,590 --> 02:35:44,550
But thank you for asking.

4008
02:35:44,870 --> 02:35:46,030
Oh, but you

4009
02:35:49,130 --> 02:35:50,850
mean thank you for asking!

4010
02:35:52,050 --> 02:35:54,130
How long have you been working for Savannah?

4011
02:35:54,850 --> 02:35:58,050
Started a few years back as a fill-in gig during spring break.

4012
02:35:58,310 --> 02:36:03,010
Eventually she needed a long-term assistant, and the job was just too weird to turn down.

4013
02:36:03,710 --> 02:36:04,230
That's fair.

4014
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:04,930
Oh, okay.

4015
02:36:05,730 --> 02:36:07,210
I'll stop bugging you now.

4016
02:36:07,470 --> 02:36:08,070
Talk to you later.

4017
02:36:08,070 --> 02:36:08,870
Thanks!

4018
02:36:09,570 --> 02:36:11,870
Okay, what were we- Oh, we were going up to the room.

4019
02:36:22,740 --> 02:36:25,020
Guys, things are getting real freaky!

4020
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:29,440
Things are getting real freaky!

4021
02:36:35,700 --> 02:36:37,920
They took the two off our door!

4022
02:36:40,300 --> 02:36:42,040
Trying to get us out of here.

4023
02:36:42,620 --> 02:36:43,440
Holy cow!

4024
02:36:45,260 --> 02:36:46,380
It did work!

4025
02:36:46,660 --> 02:36:47,340
Oh my gosh!

4026
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:48,400
Whoever saw that?

4027
02:36:48,520 --> 02:36:49,220
You're a genius!

4028
02:36:51,160 --> 02:36:53,040
We're just in someone else's room though.

4029
02:36:54,120 --> 02:36:54,580
Okay.

4030
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:56,960
I'm trespassing.

4031
02:36:57,200 --> 02:36:59,600
I'm breaking and entering, but...

4032
02:37:01,220 --> 02:37:02,460
There's nothing in here though.

4033
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:05,180
Well, that was 22.

4034
02:37:07,740 --> 02:37:08,300
Okay.

4035
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:11,560
Spooky!

4036
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:13,960
So spooky.

4037
02:37:17,480 --> 02:37:19,740
Wait, is this the last person that's been staying here?

4038
02:37:20,380 --> 02:37:24,540
When we first walked in the door, my wife told me she had a bad feeling about this place.

4039
02:37:24,700 --> 02:37:27,100
But no, I told her she was being unreasonable.

4040
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:31,560
But whatever it is that's going on down here, we are not putting up with it anymore.

4041
02:37:31,860 --> 02:37:32,520
What's this accent?

4042
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:33,880
The thing you left in our room!

4043
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:36,320
No one should ever see something like that.

4044
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:36,680
Aussie?

4045
02:37:36,680 --> 02:37:37,880
I want my money back.

4046
02:37:38,100 --> 02:37:39,260
There was nothing there.

4047
02:37:39,740 --> 02:37:41,840
And I want to see this place closed down!

4048
02:37:42,300 --> 02:37:42,640
Oh, yeah!

4049
02:37:42,900 --> 02:37:44,900
You'd never get away with something like this in Sydney!

4050
02:37:45,360 --> 02:37:47,320
Sir, please, we are not haunted.

4051
02:37:47,320 --> 02:37:49,420
Now, please yourself!

4052
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:50,060
Oh!

4053
02:37:51,060 --> 02:37:52,060
Don't mind if I do.

4054
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:53,480
Mew!

4055
02:37:53,620 --> 02:37:54,460
Oh, this is so sad.

4056
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:57,540
Oh, Mew Echo!

4057
02:37:58,240 --> 02:37:58,700
Oh!

4058
02:37:59,400 --> 02:38:01,120
It's just us now, isn't it?

4059
02:38:07,150 --> 02:38:07,710
Crikey!

4060
02:38:08,430 --> 02:38:10,970
Oh, we're the only ones staying here now!

4061
02:38:12,350 --> 02:38:14,930
That was the last customer, wasn't it?

4062
02:38:15,510 --> 02:38:16,210
Yes, Nancy.

4063
02:38:16,430 --> 02:38:17,550
It's just you.

4064
02:38:19,350 --> 02:38:21,290
So, make yourself comfortable.

4065
02:38:21,290 --> 02:38:25,010
We are all here for you until something happens to scare you off, too.

4066
02:38:25,370 --> 02:38:26,550
I don't scare easily.

4067
02:38:27,270 --> 02:38:27,590
Except that cat!

4068
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:28,310
I've heard that before.

4069
02:38:29,290 --> 02:38:33,630
Look, I'm sorry I shouldn't be upsetting you with all of this.

4070
02:38:34,390 --> 02:38:34,690
Please.

4071
02:38:35,210 --> 02:38:36,690
You're my only guest left.

4072
02:38:36,970 --> 02:38:39,130
Let me at least make sure you have a good trip.

4073
02:38:39,790 --> 02:38:41,510
Maybe you recommend us to your friends.

4074
02:38:42,850 --> 02:38:47,830
That guy definitely did not swear enough to be an angry Australian.

4075
02:38:48,310 --> 02:38:49,750
I still want to help.

4076
02:38:50,390 --> 02:38:50,910
Help?

4077
02:38:51,230 --> 02:38:51,990
You want to help?

4078
02:38:52,170 --> 02:38:53,090
Look around you.

4079
02:38:53,310 --> 02:38:54,930
This place is beyond help.

4080
02:38:55,230 --> 02:38:57,890
It was spooky and lonely before...

4081
02:38:58,450 --> 02:38:59,890
Everything that happened, happened.

4082
02:39:00,130 --> 02:39:00,990
And now...

4083
02:39:01,990 --> 02:39:05,330
Why do you think Yumi got out of this place as soon as she could?

4084
02:39:06,090 --> 02:39:08,610
People come because they heard it's haunted.

4085
02:39:08,950 --> 02:39:11,970
They come here to be scared and even they can't take it.

4086
02:39:13,370 --> 02:39:14,470
I'm sorry, Nancy.

4087
02:39:15,070 --> 02:39:16,610
There's nothing you can do here.

4088
02:39:16,970 --> 02:39:19,570
Help yourself and find somewhere safer to stay.

4089
02:39:23,750 --> 02:39:24,750
Okay.

4090
02:39:24,790 --> 02:39:24,950
Okay.

4091
02:39:26,510 --> 02:39:27,510
Um...

4092
02:39:27,510 --> 02:39:29,150
We still need to...

4093
02:39:31,330 --> 02:39:33,010
Try and...

4094
02:39:33,010 --> 02:39:33,670
What's...

4095
02:39:33,670 --> 02:39:34,830
Oh my gosh.

4096
02:39:35,370 --> 02:39:37,250
Who's sending me messages?

4097
02:39:37,430 --> 02:39:37,530
Oh.

4098
02:39:38,390 --> 02:39:38,990
Oh.

4099
02:39:38,990 --> 02:39:39,270
Oh.

4100
02:39:40,110 --> 02:39:52,310
Last evening, officers responded to an emergency call from 15-year-old Shimizu Yumi after she found her mother, Shimizu Kasumi, 42, who runs the Ryokan Hiei, lying unconscious in the indoor Ryokan bath.

4101
02:39:52,890 --> 02:39:53,590
After arriving...

4102
02:39:53,590 --> 02:39:53,890
Ew!

4103
02:39:54,190 --> 02:39:57,850
We've been bathing in a place where the bomb died?!

4104
02:39:58,750 --> 02:39:59,770
No way!

4105
02:40:03,220 --> 02:40:04,500
Oh my god!

4106
02:40:06,180 --> 02:40:10,480
After arriving, emergency crews were unable to revive the apparent drowning victim.

4107
02:40:11,400 --> 02:40:16,100
Police are currently treating the case as a crime, but have yet to press charges.

4108
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:18,940
If this is an accident, that's it.

4109
02:40:19,100 --> 02:40:20,340
The article ends there.

4110
02:40:20,540 --> 02:40:20,940
Logan.

4111
02:40:21,820 --> 02:40:22,500
Okay.

4112
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:31,160
Hmm.

4113
02:40:31,160 --> 02:40:31,360
Hmm.

4114
02:40:34,700 --> 02:40:35,220
Hmm.

4115
02:40:35,220 --> 02:40:35,240
Hmm.

4116
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:41,560
Let's...

4117
02:40:41,560 --> 02:40:43,640
So are we now in a murder mystery?

4118
02:40:44,660 --> 02:40:46,240
Hello, Nancy-san.

4119
02:40:46,580 --> 02:40:47,220
Oh boy.

4120
02:40:47,420 --> 02:40:47,620
Okay.

4121
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:50,520
Uh...

4122
02:40:50,520 --> 02:40:54,060
I have to go to the bathroom real quick, but...

4123
02:40:54,060 --> 02:40:55,540
Can you tell me a little about Kasumi?

4124
02:40:55,700 --> 02:40:56,300
Let's listen to this.

4125
02:40:56,320 --> 02:40:58,640
She would have been quite fond of you.

4126
02:40:59,080 --> 02:40:59,520
What?

4127
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:01,140
Quite fonded?

4128
02:41:01,140 --> 02:41:04,040
She always loved people who sink for themselves.

4129
02:41:04,660 --> 02:41:06,140
And she loved stubbornness.

4130
02:41:07,340 --> 02:41:07,860
Hey!

4131
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:09,140
She sinks for herself.

4132
02:41:09,180 --> 02:41:11,080
That is not always a bad quality...

4133
02:41:11,080 --> 02:41:11,160
I'm sinking!

4134
02:41:11,360 --> 02:41:12,200
I'm drowning here!

4135
02:41:12,400 --> 02:41:13,020
Oh, too soon?

4136
02:41:13,040 --> 02:41:13,560
Oh god.

4137
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:15,160
Kasumi herself is very stubborn.

4138
02:41:15,500 --> 02:41:16,980
Was very stubborn.

4139
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:19,300
But it made her the most beloved of the children in her school.

4140
02:41:19,400 --> 02:41:20,120
How insensitive!

4141
02:41:20,260 --> 02:41:21,180
That's how she died!

4142
02:41:21,180 --> 02:41:27,180
When she was young, she could never stand to see injustice done to others.

4143
02:41:27,660 --> 02:41:30,080
It made me very proud of her.

4144
02:41:30,420 --> 02:41:32,960
But that also has its bad side.

4145
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:34,300
How so?

4146
02:41:34,520 --> 02:41:34,900
Grandma!

4147
02:41:35,440 --> 02:41:35,880
I'm sorry.

4148
02:41:36,100 --> 02:41:37,580
I shouldn't bore you.

4149
02:41:37,900 --> 02:41:41,420
You must not worry about these things, Nancy-san.

4150
02:41:41,480 --> 02:41:41,800
Oh, sorry.

4151
02:41:43,380 --> 02:41:44,340
Oh, gosh.

4152
02:41:46,980 --> 02:41:47,920
Oh, wow.

4153
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:48,520
There's a lot.

4154
02:41:48,640 --> 02:41:49,020
Okay, go on.

4155
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:50,980
What happened the night Kasumi died?

4156
02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:55,440
It is not always good to be so curious, Nancy-san.

4157
02:41:55,920 --> 02:41:58,240
I thought she was gonna kick us out.

4158
02:42:00,840 --> 02:42:01,520
Okay.

4159
02:42:01,960 --> 02:42:02,260
Yeah.

4160
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:03,580
We don't...

4161
02:42:03,580 --> 02:42:06,180
Nancy, what an insensitive question to ask.

4162
02:42:06,800 --> 02:42:08,300
Why would you...

4163
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,680
Do you remember when Savannah Woodham visited?

4164
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:14,220
I don't recognize the name.

4165
02:42:14,600 --> 02:42:16,660
She's the one who wrote about the Ryokan.

4166
02:42:16,660 --> 02:42:18,000
I said...

4167
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,240
I do not know who she is.

4168
02:42:21,900 --> 02:42:22,980
So then...

4169
02:42:23,540 --> 02:42:24,260
Oh.

4170
02:42:24,900 --> 02:42:26,360
Someone else, then.

4171
02:42:26,600 --> 02:42:27,060
Talk to her?

4172
02:42:27,940 --> 02:42:30,920
What do you think about Rantaro and Miwako dating?

4173
02:42:31,380 --> 02:42:33,380
Those two are so different.

4174
02:42:33,820 --> 02:42:38,300
When they were children, you couldn't keep them in the same room.

4175
02:42:38,300 --> 02:42:40,960
Aloe's so much fighting.

4176
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:43,720
That has not changed.

4177
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:45,540
Except now.

4178
02:42:46,200 --> 02:42:48,140
They say they're in love.

4179
02:42:49,640 --> 02:42:49,800
Oh.

4180
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:53,320
I saw watery footprints in my room.

4181
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:55,020
It was very strange.

4182
02:42:55,420 --> 02:42:55,580
Yeah, yeah.

4183
02:42:55,860 --> 02:42:57,160
You must be mistaken.

4184
02:42:57,520 --> 02:42:59,140
No, I'm positive.

4185
02:42:59,320 --> 02:42:59,600
Yeah, it happened.

4186
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:00,020
No.

4187
02:43:00,420 --> 02:43:03,380
It is not wise to joke about these things.

4188
02:43:03,660 --> 02:43:04,360
Does grandma...

4189
02:43:04,360 --> 02:43:04,760
I'm not.

4190
02:43:04,940 --> 02:43:06,720
I do not want to talk about it.

4191
02:43:07,400 --> 02:43:09,860
Does grandma think this place is haunted or not?

4192
02:43:10,100 --> 02:43:11,000
I'll talk to you later.

4193
02:43:11,340 --> 02:43:11,700
Goodbye.

4194
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:14,960
Does she think this place is haunted or not?

4195
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:18,560
I can't take this if Takai is here.

4196
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:19,340
Okay.

4197
02:43:19,340 --> 02:43:21,140
We're gonna have to somehow...

4198
02:43:21,140 --> 02:43:22,140
Come back.

4199
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:26,340
Maybe we can...

4200
02:43:26,960 --> 02:43:27,640
Let's see.

4201
02:43:28,520 --> 02:43:30,340
Oh, we might be able to, like...

4202
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:33,780
I should wait until Takai is gone to open this.

4203
02:43:33,960 --> 02:43:37,510
We might be able to get into one of the rooms and then, like, use the doors to...

4204
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:39,740
You know?

4205
02:43:40,360 --> 02:43:42,940
To, like, get into one of...

4206
02:43:42,940 --> 02:43:43,100
Whoops.

4207
02:43:43,420 --> 02:43:44,060
Whoops, sorry, my bad.

4208
02:43:46,260 --> 02:43:47,480
Into, like, this...

4209
02:43:47,480 --> 02:43:49,600
One of these and then just go down, down, down.

4210
02:43:49,940 --> 02:43:50,400
You know?

4211
02:43:51,260 --> 02:43:53,840
So let's try that also upstairs.

4212
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:57,980
It's our...

4213
02:43:57,980 --> 02:43:59,020
Freaky door.

4214
02:43:59,220 --> 02:44:00,580
That wasn't red before.

4215
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:01,640
What?!

4216
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:03,980
Okay, ghost.

4217
02:44:04,140 --> 02:44:05,320
You're doing too much.

4218
02:44:07,400 --> 02:44:07,920
Squidward!

4219
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:09,480
Thank you so much for the...

4220
02:44:11,020 --> 02:44:11,840
This is...

4221
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:12,640
This is too...

4222
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:13,780
This is too much.

4223
02:44:15,480 --> 02:44:15,920
You're...

4224
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:16,320
You're...

4225
02:44:16,320 --> 02:44:17,280
You're milking it.

4226
02:44:17,540 --> 02:44:18,640
Way too hard.

4227
02:44:19,720 --> 02:44:20,600
So funny.

4228
02:44:22,200 --> 02:44:23,880
I'll turn the...

4229
02:44:26,100 --> 02:44:28,760
I'll turn her name and her room red!

4230
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:32,200
I don't think I'd be able to sleep in this place, though.

4231
02:44:32,740 --> 02:44:33,620
What time is it?

4232
02:44:33,760 --> 02:44:34,180
Okay, nine.

4233
02:44:34,520 --> 02:44:37,760
I don't think I'd be able to sleep in this place, though, if all my doors are open.

4234
02:44:39,560 --> 02:44:40,000
Okay.

4235
02:44:42,950 --> 02:44:43,490
Nothing here.

4236
02:44:43,670 --> 02:44:44,570
Nothing here.

4237
02:44:44,570 --> 02:44:44,710
There.

4238
02:44:45,400 --> 02:44:46,290
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4239
02:44:46,570 --> 02:44:46,670
Here.

4240
02:44:47,690 --> 02:44:48,700
There's the futon...

4241
02:44:49,410 --> 02:44:49,790
Here.

4242
02:44:50,510 --> 02:44:52,550
God, the music scared me!

4243
02:44:54,470 --> 02:44:54,840
Eww!

4244
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:56,310
Okay.

4245
02:44:57,430 --> 02:44:58,710
Nothing else here.

4246
02:45:00,130 --> 02:45:02,070
I wouldn't be able to sleep with that robo-cat.

4247
02:45:02,370 --> 02:45:02,710
So true!

4248
02:45:09,980 --> 02:45:11,640
Why is this game so scary?

4249
02:45:12,200 --> 02:45:13,240
Okay, this is our room.

4250
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:18,980
We're just breaking into everybody's room.

4251
02:45:19,080 --> 02:45:20,060
We already checked this one.

4252
02:45:20,860 --> 02:45:21,860
Let's check this one out.

4253
02:45:24,400 --> 02:45:24,880
Okay.

4254
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:28,000
Nothing.

4255
02:45:29,100 --> 02:45:29,900
I'm scared.

4256
02:45:30,060 --> 02:45:31,320
I'm scared there's gonna be a jump scare.

4257
02:45:31,940 --> 02:45:32,020
Oh.

4258
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:34,140
Wait, I think that's the end of the road.

4259
02:45:37,380 --> 02:45:37,860
Hmm.

4260
02:45:38,680 --> 02:45:39,060
Okay.

4261
02:45:40,220 --> 02:45:41,640
Not much of anything, then.

4262
02:45:45,140 --> 02:45:46,080
Mint didn't pee.

4263
02:45:46,320 --> 02:45:47,260
Yeah, I'm gonna go do that.

4264
02:45:47,820 --> 02:45:48,300
Alright.

4265
02:45:50,060 --> 02:45:50,540
Now.

4266
02:45:52,580 --> 02:45:55,520
Yeah, I'm gonna do that before a jump scare happens.

4267
02:45:56,400 --> 02:45:57,400
You know?

4268
02:45:58,360 --> 02:45:59,620
And I'm like...

4269
02:46:00,520 --> 02:46:01,900
And then...

4270
02:46:01,900 --> 02:46:02,060
Uh oh.

4271
02:46:03,440 --> 02:46:05,000
Okay, it's boy's hour.

4272
02:46:06,980 --> 02:46:07,780
Okay.

4273
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:08,860
I'll be right back.

4274
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:32,640
Anything spooky happen?

4275
02:48:34,060 --> 02:48:34,740
Let's save.

4276
02:48:35,580 --> 02:48:37,360
Anything spooky happen while I was gone?

4277
02:48:38,260 --> 02:48:38,820
Okaeri.

4278
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:40,240
Tadahima.

4279
02:48:41,100 --> 02:48:41,660
Tadahima.

4280
02:48:42,240 --> 02:48:42,520
Tadahima.

4281
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:44,740
Vinto isn't here so I can finally say my truth?

4282
02:48:44,940 --> 02:48:45,200
Oh.

4283
02:48:52,260 --> 02:48:52,820
Okay.

4284
02:48:53,160 --> 02:48:54,340
Let's try...

4285
02:48:54,340 --> 02:48:54,840
Oh wait.

4286
02:48:54,980 --> 02:48:56,160
We can't call anybody in here.

4287
02:48:57,260 --> 02:48:58,960
Let's call somebody here.

4288
02:49:00,560 --> 02:49:01,120
Maybe...

4289
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:01,860
Besh?

4290
02:49:04,300 --> 02:49:05,980
Thank you for all the super chats, you guys!

4291
02:49:06,160 --> 02:49:06,780
Thank you!

4292
02:49:07,700 --> 02:49:08,000
Thank you!

4293
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:11,280
There were watery footprints in my room that led straight into a wall.

4294
02:49:11,640 --> 02:49:13,280
Why are you still there?

4295
02:49:13,780 --> 02:49:15,240
You've lost your mind.

4296
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:19,260
You know how in the scary movies you always wanna yell, Don't go in that door!

4297
02:49:19,520 --> 02:49:20,800
But they never can hear you?

4298
02:49:20,800 --> 02:49:21,380
Yeah?

4299
02:49:21,900 --> 02:49:22,260
Yeah?

4300
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:23,300
Well, you can hear me.

4301
02:49:23,620 --> 02:49:25,300
So, don't go in that door!

4302
02:49:25,580 --> 02:49:26,260
I already did though.

4303
02:49:26,260 --> 02:49:38,160
Call this mystery a wash and come stay at our hotel, which has a nice ghost-free view, and a ghost-free pool, and tiny, overpriced, ghost-free packets of peanuts.

4304
02:49:38,680 --> 02:49:43,360
That's a nice offer, but I think I'm getting close to figuring out what's going on here.

4305
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:47,660
Since you won't listen to Reason, you're gonna have to listen to George on this one.

4306
02:49:47,740 --> 02:49:48,220
Ghost-free!

4307
02:49:48,220 --> 02:49:49,420
Thanks a lot, Bess!

4308
02:49:49,620 --> 02:49:50,260
Ghost-free!

4309
02:49:50,580 --> 02:49:52,860
Unfortunately, I don't have a clue about what to do with this one.

4310
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:53,360
Ghost-free!

4311
02:49:53,600 --> 02:49:56,180
But Nancy, whatever's going on out there, be careful.

4312
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:57,940
I will, promise.

4313
02:49:58,260 --> 02:50:01,280
Is that like one of those child-free resorts, except it's ghost-free?

4314
02:50:01,940 --> 02:50:02,340
No.

4315
02:50:03,240 --> 02:50:04,480
Do I get to stay for free?

4316
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:05,920
Maybe.

4317
02:50:09,340 --> 02:50:12,540
I had another strange run-in with a ghost here.

4318
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:13,880
What happened this time?

4319
02:50:13,880 --> 02:50:14,640
Yeah, free for ghosts!

4320
02:50:14,660 --> 02:50:18,080
I was in the hallway, and one by one the door started to slam.

4321
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:20,800
And I heard the sound of water dripping.

4322
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:21,960
Creepy.

4323
02:50:22,080 --> 02:50:22,480
Creepy.

4324
02:50:22,820 --> 02:50:25,280
Just thinking about that, I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight.

4325
02:50:25,720 --> 02:50:26,920
Not sure how you do it.

4326
02:50:27,060 --> 02:50:27,520
Creepy.

4327
02:50:27,740 --> 02:50:29,700
It is a little creepy, I'll admit that.

4328
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:32,880
I just need to figure out how someone could do it.

4329
02:50:33,100 --> 02:50:33,700
Good call.

4330
02:50:33,960 --> 02:50:36,940
It could be pretty easily automated, I think.

4331
02:50:37,300 --> 02:50:38,820
What are we waiting on?

4332
02:50:38,820 --> 02:50:40,380
What other stuff is there?

4333
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:42,540
I'll talk to you later.

4334
02:50:42,800 --> 02:50:43,140
Bye!

4335
02:50:43,400 --> 02:50:44,600
I'm trying to think.

4336
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:50,400
Maybe you, me?

4337
02:50:52,740 --> 02:50:53,500
Hello!

4338
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:55,060
Not in!

4339
02:50:58,240 --> 02:50:59,560
Not in!

4340
02:51:00,140 --> 02:51:00,960
Bye-bye!

4341
02:51:04,590 --> 02:51:05,730
Call Savannah.

4342
02:51:05,730 --> 02:51:06,130
I don't know.

4343
02:51:06,330 --> 02:51:08,650
I don't know if there was anything else we could get out of her.

4344
02:51:09,970 --> 02:51:10,810
Logan speaking.

4345
02:51:11,070 --> 02:51:11,750
Is this Nancy?

4346
02:51:12,070 --> 02:51:12,470
Yeah.

4347
02:51:13,170 --> 02:51:13,590
Great!

4348
02:51:14,070 --> 02:51:15,090
I'm so glad you called.

4349
02:51:15,350 --> 02:51:15,770
Why?

4350
02:51:15,950 --> 02:51:17,430
So you can hang up on me again?

4351
02:51:17,970 --> 02:51:18,650
Oh, that.

4352
02:51:18,850 --> 02:51:19,810
Don't take that personally.

4353
02:51:20,050 --> 02:51:20,810
I'm an assistant.

4354
02:51:20,810 --> 02:51:23,650
My job mostly consists of hanging up on people.

4355
02:51:23,890 --> 02:51:24,890
Oh, my God!

4356
02:51:25,890 --> 02:51:27,110
I met your friend, Bess.

4357
02:51:27,550 --> 02:51:31,910
And this is probably awkward, but I know we haven't gotten off to the best start.

4358
02:51:32,050 --> 02:51:34,990
But I'm really not a bad guy, and she's really cute.

4359
02:51:35,490 --> 02:51:37,070
And maybe you could help a dude out?

4360
02:51:37,430 --> 02:51:37,870
Alright.

4361
02:51:38,510 --> 02:51:38,850
What?

4362
02:51:39,310 --> 02:51:49,550
Well, she said she's going to be hanging around the expo, and maybe you could, like, tell me about what she likes, or maybe give me some idea of what I might say until the awkward pauses.

4363
02:51:49,690 --> 02:51:50,070
Hang up on him!

4364
02:51:50,070 --> 02:51:50,750
Hang up on him!

4365
02:51:50,750 --> 02:51:56,310
But for the last while I've been with Savannah, most of my conversations have been about ten seconds long.

4366
02:51:56,510 --> 02:51:59,010
And they usually end up with me hanging up on someone.

4367
02:51:59,010 --> 02:51:59,270
Oh, my God!

4368
02:51:59,450 --> 02:52:00,890
And I don't think that's going to cut it.

4369
02:52:01,230 --> 02:52:01,770
Oh, I see.

4370
02:52:01,770 --> 02:52:03,670
Slept in a haunted hotel, it was just bed bugs.

4371
02:52:03,950 --> 02:52:04,350
Do you think you could help?

4372
02:52:04,750 --> 02:52:10,110
Well, I was talking to her, and she really wants a copy of Savannah's book.

4373
02:52:10,750 --> 02:52:12,630
Oh, I see what you did there.

4374
02:52:13,150 --> 02:52:13,550
Okay.

4375
02:52:14,150 --> 02:52:16,570
As a gesture of goodwill, I'll do it.

4376
02:52:16,750 --> 02:52:17,150
Hey!

4377
02:52:17,910 --> 02:52:19,190
I'm sorry I hung up on you.

4378
02:52:19,410 --> 02:52:20,090
Yeah, you should be.

4379
02:52:20,270 --> 02:52:20,310
That's okay.

4380
02:52:20,750 --> 02:52:23,070
And Nancy, I might have to do it again.

4381
02:52:23,270 --> 02:52:25,330
But should that happen, it's just business.

4382
02:52:25,850 --> 02:52:26,570
Bye, Logan.

4383
02:52:30,810 --> 02:52:31,410
Suica!

4384
02:52:31,810 --> 02:52:32,790
Welcome to the bamboo ship!

4385
02:52:32,910 --> 02:52:33,450
Thank you!

4386
02:52:35,810 --> 02:52:36,410
Oh,

4387
02:52:40,710 --> 02:52:41,190
Logan.

4388
02:52:42,470 --> 02:52:43,070
Okay.

4389
02:52:43,370 --> 02:52:47,390
I remember, we were going to see if maybe one of these were open.

4390
02:52:48,430 --> 02:52:49,070
locked.

4391
02:52:49,890 --> 02:52:50,530
Locked.

4392
02:52:50,810 --> 02:52:51,450
Locked.

4393
02:52:51,590 --> 02:52:52,230
Locked.

4394
02:52:52,430 --> 02:52:52,830
Locked.

4395
02:52:53,410 --> 02:52:55,510
I need a key to open this door.

4396
02:52:55,690 --> 02:52:58,090
We don't have any keys to open these.

4397
02:52:58,890 --> 02:52:59,730
You know?

4398
02:53:00,270 --> 02:53:00,850
So...

4399
02:53:00,850 --> 02:53:01,470
And we only...

4400
02:53:01,470 --> 02:53:01,750
Oh.

4401
02:53:02,370 --> 02:53:02,970
Wait.

4402
02:53:02,970 --> 02:53:05,130
We only have until 10.30.

4403
02:53:05,430 --> 02:53:05,490
We only have until 10.30.

4404
02:53:05,490 --> 02:53:05,770
And it's...

4405
02:53:05,770 --> 02:53:06,130
Oh!

4406
02:53:06,450 --> 02:53:07,770
We have three minutes.

4407
02:53:14,250 --> 02:53:15,970
How do we get inside?

4408
02:53:17,030 --> 02:53:18,190
We still...

4409
02:53:18,190 --> 02:53:20,270
Because I need the tea kettle for this.

4410
02:53:24,190 --> 02:53:27,150
And we still haven't been able to...

4411
02:53:27,150 --> 02:53:28,370
So there was also...

4412
02:53:29,490 --> 02:53:29,930
This...

4413
02:53:29,930 --> 02:53:30,250
The...

4414
02:53:30,250 --> 02:53:30,990
The...

4415
02:53:30,990 --> 02:53:31,890
Like the...

4416
02:53:31,890 --> 02:53:33,570
Card puzzle that I haven't been able to do.

4417
02:53:33,730 --> 02:53:35,070
Because I don't have the other card.

4418
02:53:35,290 --> 02:53:36,630
And I can't get the password.

4419
02:53:37,830 --> 02:53:38,270
Hello?

4420
02:53:39,390 --> 02:53:40,350
Oh my god!

4421
02:53:40,770 --> 02:53:41,830
Can we just say that?

4422
02:53:42,390 --> 02:53:44,110
I know what happened to your mother.

4423
02:53:44,910 --> 02:53:46,790
I know what happened to your mother.

4424
02:53:47,050 --> 02:53:48,130
I told you to...

4425
02:53:48,130 --> 02:53:49,230
It was an accident.

4426
02:53:49,610 --> 02:53:50,730
I think you...

4427
02:53:50,730 --> 02:53:51,830
All of you...

4428
02:53:51,830 --> 02:53:52,510
Blame yourselves.

4429
02:53:53,370 --> 02:53:54,930
It wasn't an accident.

4430
02:53:55,350 --> 02:53:57,230
But since you won't let it drop.

4431
02:53:57,770 --> 02:54:00,190
You wanna know why we all blame ourselves, Nancy?

4432
02:54:00,570 --> 02:54:00,990
Why?

4433
02:54:01,550 --> 02:54:01,970
Why?

4434
02:54:02,690 --> 02:54:03,250
Because...

4435
02:54:03,250 --> 02:54:04,510
We were all here.

4436
02:54:04,850 --> 02:54:06,610
We were all here that night.

4437
02:54:06,790 --> 02:54:08,390
And not one of us helped her.

4438
02:54:08,750 --> 02:54:10,470
We all just let her die...

4439
02:54:10,470 --> 02:54:10,770
Alone.

4440
02:54:11,290 --> 02:54:12,550
But you didn't know.

4441
02:54:12,850 --> 02:54:14,290
Leave me alone, Nancy.

4442
02:54:17,450 --> 02:54:18,690
Oh, Nancy.

4443
02:54:19,890 --> 02:54:23,590
This is the worst way of trying to comfort anybody ever.

4444
02:54:25,130 --> 02:54:25,670
Hello?

4445
02:54:26,070 --> 02:54:26,370
Hello!

4446
02:54:29,630 --> 02:54:30,310
Um...

4447
02:54:30,310 --> 02:54:31,410
Okay, uh...

4448
02:54:31,410 --> 02:54:33,930
Miwako seems a little frustrated lately.

4449
02:54:34,690 --> 02:54:35,750
Why wouldn't she be?

4450
02:54:36,030 --> 02:54:38,070
The way guests have been filing out.

4451
02:54:39,030 --> 02:54:43,730
But maybe she'll finally come to her senses and move to the city with me.

4452
02:54:44,290 --> 02:54:45,910
Oh, so he definitely wants to get out of here.

4453
02:54:46,630 --> 02:54:47,790
And like, do...

4454
02:54:47,790 --> 02:54:49,750
I think he's trying to scare her out.

4455
02:54:50,730 --> 02:54:51,530
Or like...

4456
02:54:51,530 --> 02:54:52,450
Not scare her...

4457
02:54:52,450 --> 02:54:53,070
But like, you know...

4458
02:54:53,070 --> 02:54:55,070
He's just trying to make it so that the place isn't profitable.

4459
02:54:55,070 --> 02:54:56,090
So that...

4460
02:54:56,090 --> 02:54:57,030
She'll leave.

4461
02:54:57,410 --> 02:54:58,210
I think it's...

4462
02:54:58,210 --> 02:54:58,570
Dentaro!

4463
02:55:04,210 --> 02:55:04,610
Not...

4464
02:55:05,230 --> 02:55:06,030
Sure-ace.

4465
02:55:06,650 --> 02:55:07,570
Is that how you say it?

4466
02:55:07,850 --> 02:55:08,330
Thank you!

4467
02:55:08,450 --> 02:55:09,010
Welcome to membership!

4468
02:55:09,270 --> 02:55:09,730
Thank you!

4469
02:55:11,790 --> 02:55:16,190
It's like not pressuring her because he's not the one to be the bad guy, you know?

4470
02:55:16,310 --> 02:55:18,030
It's the ghost that's the bad guy.

4471
02:55:18,230 --> 02:55:20,970
If he were to be like, Miwako, I wanna leave!

4472
02:55:21,050 --> 02:55:21,530
I wanna leave!

4473
02:55:21,630 --> 02:55:22,090
I wanna leave!

4474
02:55:22,150 --> 02:55:23,090
And she's like, no, no, no!

4475
02:55:23,210 --> 02:55:24,490
I have to run the ryokan!

4476
02:55:25,350 --> 02:55:25,670
Then...

4477
02:55:26,390 --> 02:55:26,710
Then...

4478
02:55:26,710 --> 02:55:27,890
He's the bad guy.

4479
02:55:28,010 --> 02:55:32,990
But if it's the ghost that's causing the ryokan to close down, then it's not his fault.

4480
02:55:34,190 --> 02:55:36,670
So how long have you and Miwako been dating?

4481
02:55:37,450 --> 02:55:40,370
Officially, four years and seven months.

4482
02:55:40,930 --> 02:55:42,290
Non-officially, longer.

4483
02:55:42,470 --> 02:55:42,950
What do you mean by that?

4484
02:55:43,090 --> 02:55:44,170
What do you mean non-officially?

4485
02:55:44,350 --> 02:55:50,970
And before that, a long time of me waiting for her to stop being so stubborn and agree to go out on a date with me.

4486
02:55:57,560 --> 02:56:00,280
But truthfully... this is Rentaro's thoughts.

4487
02:56:00,580 --> 02:56:02,300
Truthfully, we've always been dating.

4488
02:56:04,640 --> 02:56:06,120
Oh my god!

4489
02:56:07,680 --> 02:56:09,100
Rentaro, you're delusional!

4490
02:56:09,400 --> 02:56:10,400
Well, maybe not.

4491
02:56:10,520 --> 02:56:12,360
They're actually dating, but holy cow!

4492
02:56:13,060 --> 02:56:15,900
What does Takai think of your relationship with Miwako?

4493
02:56:16,380 --> 02:56:19,420
At this point, I think she considers me part of the family.

4494
02:56:19,820 --> 02:56:22,400
Or at least she lectures me like I'm one of the family.

4495
02:56:22,400 --> 02:56:22,840
Oh boy!

4496
02:56:23,600 --> 02:56:26,000
I'm choosing to interpret that in a positive light.

4497
02:56:27,420 --> 02:56:32,780
She's always been my... I'm... I'm Rentaro and she's my Miwako.

4498
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:35,000
Oh, the music.

4499
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:36,160
I thought something was in my room.

4500
02:56:36,400 --> 02:56:37,400
I saw some guests just leave.

4501
02:56:37,400 --> 02:56:39,040
I saw some more guests just leave.

4502
02:56:39,340 --> 02:56:41,060
They seemed pretty spooked.

4503
02:56:41,500 --> 02:56:41,800
Yeah.

4504
02:56:42,380 --> 02:56:43,760
Those poor people.

4505
02:56:44,140 --> 02:56:45,920
Oh, he sounds so insincere!

4506
02:56:45,940 --> 02:56:46,560
Who knows?

4507
02:56:46,840 --> 02:56:49,240
They were too upset to make any sense.

4508
02:56:49,260 --> 02:56:50,460
Those poor people.

4509
02:56:50,460 --> 02:56:52,880
I took care of their room after they left.

4510
02:56:53,340 --> 02:56:56,260
I admit, it was a little spooky.

4511
02:56:57,160 --> 02:56:59,000
Everything was torn up.

4512
02:56:59,160 --> 02:57:02,700
Like someone had taken the whole ryokan and given it a shake.

4513
02:57:02,960 --> 02:57:05,560
And the shoji had turned this dark ash cutter.

4514
02:57:06,520 --> 02:57:07,940
Something weird happened in there.

4515
02:57:07,940 --> 02:57:09,320
Wait, can we find their room?

4516
02:57:11,060 --> 02:57:12,360
Can we find it?

4517
02:57:12,820 --> 02:57:14,080
This is broke, eh.

4518
02:57:15,240 --> 02:57:18,500
Is that the same answer when people ask how long you and Snake have been dating?

4519
02:57:19,980 --> 02:57:20,460
Hey.

4520
02:57:20,940 --> 02:57:22,140
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

4521
02:57:22,140 --> 02:57:25,260
Miwako seems a little annoyed that you want her to leave the ryokan.

4522
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:26,180
Ha.

4523
02:57:26,480 --> 02:57:27,600
Tell me about it.

4524
02:57:27,940 --> 02:57:29,420
Are you going to keep it up?

4525
02:57:29,800 --> 02:57:32,100
Yeah, it's not just a selfish thing.

4526
02:57:32,360 --> 02:57:34,040
It's for her own good, too.

4527
02:57:34,940 --> 02:57:37,340
It's not just a selfish thing.

4528
02:57:37,480 --> 02:57:38,920
At least he admits it.

4529
02:57:38,920 --> 02:57:41,920
When did the ryokan get a reputation for being haunted?

4530
02:57:42,520 --> 02:57:43,680
A few summers back.

4531
02:57:44,580 --> 02:57:45,840
We were fully packed that night.

4532
02:57:46,260 --> 02:57:47,140
It was festival time.

4533
02:57:47,460 --> 02:57:50,920
There was this terrible scream coming from the baths.

4534
02:57:51,340 --> 02:57:54,020
Next thing I know, the paramedics were there.

4535
02:57:54,020 --> 02:57:54,460
Oh my god.

4536
02:57:54,980 --> 02:57:57,800
This woman had seen something.

4537
02:57:58,520 --> 02:58:00,060
She went into shock.

4538
02:58:00,320 --> 02:58:01,300
I didn't welcome the membership.

4539
02:58:01,440 --> 02:58:01,580
Thank you.

4540
02:58:01,580 --> 02:58:02,260
What had she seen?

4541
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:04,180
She never said.

4542
02:58:04,480 --> 02:58:06,340
A lot of people asked.

4543
02:58:06,540 --> 02:58:06,940
Trust me.

4544
02:58:07,800 --> 02:58:09,100
Wait, do you think that's...

4545
02:58:09,100 --> 02:58:09,540
What's her name?

4546
02:58:09,680 --> 02:58:10,120
I thought she saw.

4547
02:58:10,120 --> 02:58:11,080
That's gotta be Savannah.

4548
02:58:11,080 --> 02:58:12,880
Everyone else wanted to see it, too.

4549
02:58:13,100 --> 02:58:13,980
That's gotta be Savannah.

4550
02:58:14,340 --> 02:58:17,320
People started coming and pretending they could send spirits or whatever.

4551
02:58:17,320 --> 02:58:17,340
Maybe?

4552
02:58:17,340 --> 02:58:17,340
Right?

4553
02:58:18,300 --> 02:58:21,280
She saw Rentaro looking through the little people.

4554
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:21,780
What?

4555
02:58:22,320 --> 02:58:22,720
Nothing.

4556
02:58:23,460 --> 02:58:24,220
Never mind.

4557
02:58:24,880 --> 02:58:25,820
It's nothing.

4558
02:58:26,380 --> 02:58:28,640
Wait, people started coming and pretending they could see...

4559
02:58:28,640 --> 02:58:29,800
could send spirits.

4560
02:58:29,940 --> 02:58:30,620
Oh, maybe not.

4561
02:58:30,940 --> 02:58:32,060
A few of them.

4562
02:58:32,060 --> 02:58:32,840
Nothing.

4563
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:33,420
Never mind.

4564
02:58:33,740 --> 02:58:34,640
Oh, maybe not.

4565
02:58:35,420 --> 02:58:36,180
Maybe not.

4566
02:58:36,400 --> 02:58:36,760
People!

4567
02:58:37,280 --> 02:58:39,860
How are things going between you and Miwako right now?

4568
02:58:40,100 --> 02:58:45,680
You know how in the romantic movies the couple is only really happy together for like a minute at the very end?

4569
02:58:45,800 --> 02:58:46,000
What?

4570
02:58:46,180 --> 02:58:47,140
I guess so.

4571
02:58:47,600 --> 02:58:49,780
That's sort of how our relationship is.

4572
02:58:50,040 --> 02:58:52,100
Except the movie restarts every week.

4573
02:58:52,660 --> 02:58:55,460
Honestly, it gets a little tiring sometimes.

4574
02:58:55,760 --> 02:58:57,460
I don't think you guys are good for each other.

4575
02:58:57,660 --> 02:58:59,040
I'll stop bugging you now.

4576
02:58:59,500 --> 02:59:00,300
Catch you around.

4577
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:03,540
I don't think you guys are...

4578
02:59:04,760 --> 02:59:06,120
I think this...

4579
02:59:06,120 --> 02:59:07,880
This relationship is...

4580
02:59:07,880 --> 02:59:08,300
Is...

4581
02:59:08,300 --> 02:59:09,300
Is pretty over.

4582
02:59:09,800 --> 02:59:11,580
I just...

4583
02:59:12,240 --> 02:59:14,760
You know, you don't have to date your childhood friend.

4584
02:59:17,320 --> 02:59:17,880
Like...

4585
02:59:17,880 --> 02:59:20,000
Okay, what time is it now?

4586
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:21,840
10.39 PM.

4587
02:59:24,220 --> 02:59:24,700
Ah...

4588
02:59:26,400 --> 02:59:27,920
I'm just not sure what to do.

4589
02:59:28,400 --> 02:59:28,580
Locked.

4590
02:59:28,880 --> 02:59:30,240
And like, this won't work, right?

4591
02:59:31,040 --> 02:59:31,520
No.

4592
02:59:33,260 --> 02:59:33,740
Locked.

4593
02:59:33,920 --> 02:59:34,220
No.

4594
02:59:35,480 --> 02:59:35,960
Locked.

4595
02:59:36,260 --> 02:59:36,740
Locked.

4596
02:59:37,020 --> 02:59:37,160
Locked.

4597
02:59:38,540 --> 02:59:40,500
I need a key to open this door.

4598
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:41,380
So it's...

4599
02:59:41,380 --> 02:59:43,280
We gotta get a key for 16, I think.

4600
02:59:44,200 --> 02:59:44,680
Unless...

4601
02:59:44,680 --> 02:59:45,140
Nah.

4602
02:59:45,780 --> 02:59:46,440
Ffff...

4603
02:59:48,100 --> 02:59:48,820
Mmmmmmmm...

4604
02:59:52,200 --> 02:59:53,120
Hmm...

4605
02:59:53,120 --> 02:59:53,960
On off again.

4606
02:59:54,100 --> 02:59:54,940
90% off.

4607
02:59:55,120 --> 02:59:55,420
Right?

4608
03:00:00,720 --> 03:00:03,360
So we're waiting on the book...

4609
03:00:03,360 --> 03:00:04,460
From...

4610
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:06,640
From Savannah...

4611
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:07,120
From Logan.

4612
03:00:15,480 --> 03:00:18,720
We need to get the thing for the password.

4613
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:21,400
What is this?

4614
03:00:21,720 --> 03:00:22,160
Dossier?

4615
03:00:22,440 --> 03:00:23,140
Oh, yeah.

4616
03:00:26,260 --> 03:00:27,140
Call him again?

4617
03:00:27,280 --> 03:00:27,580
Yes.

4618
03:00:30,260 --> 03:00:36,080
Let me... I'm gonna go up to my room real quick and make sure nothing's changed in there.

4619
03:00:37,580 --> 03:00:39,240
Are all the doors gonna be open now?

4620
03:00:39,360 --> 03:00:39,460
Oh!

4621
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:40,460
Someone.

4622
03:00:41,440 --> 03:00:42,940
Made the bed for me, though.

4623
03:00:45,600 --> 03:00:46,480
Anything here?

4624
03:00:48,260 --> 03:00:49,100
What's your name?

4625
03:00:49,780 --> 03:00:51,200
Oh, I already graded these, didn't I?

4626
03:00:53,720 --> 03:00:54,180
Yeah.

4627
03:00:55,520 --> 03:00:55,980
Yeah.

4628
03:00:56,380 --> 03:00:57,260
Oh, they're all the same.

4629
03:00:57,400 --> 03:00:57,620
I bet.

4630
03:00:57,960 --> 03:00:58,340
Oh, no!

4631
03:00:58,900 --> 03:00:59,360
Okay.

4632
03:00:59,780 --> 03:01:00,240
Family.

4633
03:01:01,240 --> 03:01:01,700
Sakura.

4634
03:01:02,420 --> 03:01:03,860
Well, see, we need to grade these.

4635
03:01:04,400 --> 03:01:06,480
I has three sisters.

4636
03:01:06,800 --> 03:01:07,140
Uh-uh.

4637
03:01:08,040 --> 03:01:09,140
Do you have a sister?

4638
03:01:09,360 --> 03:01:09,820
Uh-uh.

4639
03:01:09,820 --> 03:01:11,460
I share my rooms.

4640
03:01:12,660 --> 03:01:13,660
Rooms?

4641
03:01:14,380 --> 03:01:15,820
I has none pets.

4642
03:01:16,100 --> 03:01:22,800
She speaks in cat... I has burger... Burger... Cheeseburger speak.

4643
03:01:25,520 --> 03:01:27,080
Do you have a sister?

4644
03:01:27,480 --> 03:01:29,020
I has none pets.

4645
03:01:35,220 --> 03:01:42,420
I feel like I share my rooms is technically... It should be I share my room, but... Maybe she has multiple rooms.

4646
03:01:42,480 --> 03:01:42,840
I don't know.

4647
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:45,320
My twin is sister.

4648
03:01:45,920 --> 03:01:47,320
This is scary.

4649
03:01:47,680 --> 03:01:48,160
I don't like it.

4650
03:01:48,560 --> 03:01:49,860
Do we have brothers?

4651
03:01:53,160 --> 03:01:57,660
What exactly is the line between intrusive nuisance and legitimate detective... Right?

4652
03:01:58,940 --> 03:02:01,100
We leave... Okay, that's just real sad.

4653
03:02:01,320 --> 03:02:02,320
I have gerbil.

4654
03:02:04,480 --> 03:02:05,820
Do we have brothers?

4655
03:02:05,980 --> 03:02:06,520
I don't know.

4656
03:02:06,920 --> 03:02:08,220
I mean, I'm asking you.

4657
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:09,600
Oh!

4658
03:02:09,600 --> 03:02:10,260
That's your homework.

4659
03:02:12,100 --> 03:02:13,580
I am an only child.

4660
03:02:13,820 --> 03:02:15,040
Does he have a sister?

4661
03:02:15,280 --> 03:02:16,220
We live in Kyoto.

4662
03:02:16,520 --> 03:02:17,940
I have a cat... Oh my gosh.

4663
03:02:19,580 --> 03:02:23,740
Oh, Fumiko is like... A genius.

4664
03:02:24,300 --> 03:02:25,200
Oh my gosh.

4665
03:02:25,520 --> 03:02:26,880
I am an only child.

4666
03:02:27,180 --> 03:02:28,340
Does he have a sister?

4667
03:02:28,720 --> 03:02:29,860
We live in Kyoto.

4668
03:02:30,600 --> 03:02:32,040
I have a cat.

4669
03:02:32,360 --> 03:02:32,860
Oh my gosh.

4670
03:02:33,040 --> 03:02:33,960
Genius, Fumiko.

4671
03:02:35,420 --> 03:02:37,080
I'm one brother.

4672
03:02:37,460 --> 03:02:39,040
We're many sisters.

4673
03:02:39,700 --> 03:02:41,280
We live in my home.

4674
03:02:41,820 --> 03:02:44,040
My bird is mine.

4675
03:02:56,800 --> 03:02:57,560
Sad.

4676
03:02:58,140 --> 03:02:58,860
Sad.

4677
03:03:00,100 --> 03:03:01,360
Technically correct.

4678
03:03:02,080 --> 03:03:03,900
My bird is mine.

4679
03:03:04,300 --> 03:03:04,660
Yippee!

4680
03:03:06,720 --> 03:03:10,340
These are more how I feel about them, more than if they're correct or not.

4681
03:03:10,340 --> 03:03:11,980
I have none, brother.

4682
03:03:12,300 --> 03:03:13,980
How many brothers have you?

4683
03:03:14,760 --> 03:03:16,420
We live in an apartment.

4684
03:03:16,780 --> 03:03:17,320
Oh, that's correct.

4685
03:03:17,700 --> 03:03:18,700
We have many fish.

4686
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:19,380
Good.

4687
03:03:19,840 --> 03:03:21,080
I have none, brother.

4688
03:03:22,860 --> 03:03:23,460
Okay.

4689
03:03:23,880 --> 03:03:24,640
That was family.

4690
03:03:24,640 --> 03:03:25,480
Now at home.

4691
03:03:26,540 --> 03:03:28,340
My mom is in the kitchen.

4692
03:03:29,980 --> 03:03:32,280
I likes to play by well.

4693
03:03:32,400 --> 03:03:33,380
Don't do that.

4694
03:03:33,740 --> 03:03:35,340
Actually, Sakura, don't do that.

4695
03:03:35,860 --> 03:03:37,040
She's gonna get isekai-ed.

4696
03:03:37,400 --> 03:03:38,980
Do you have a pikikli?

4697
03:03:49,320 --> 03:03:50,480
Oh, what was it?

4698
03:03:50,560 --> 03:03:51,280
An A apartment?

4699
03:03:51,480 --> 03:03:51,680
Oh, no.

4700
03:03:51,780 --> 03:03:52,440
Did I miss it?

4701
03:03:53,720 --> 03:03:54,340
Oh, no.

4702
03:03:54,540 --> 03:03:55,320
I misread it.

4703
03:03:55,580 --> 03:03:55,960
It's fine.

4704
03:03:57,680 --> 03:03:58,740
Do you have a pikikli?

4705
03:04:00,080 --> 03:04:01,560
I has a red pikikli.

4706
03:04:13,340 --> 03:04:15,380
My dad is in the study.

4707
03:04:15,660 --> 03:04:16,900
I leak puzzles.

4708
03:04:19,260 --> 03:04:20,640
Do you have a...

4709
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:22,620
Why are you afraid of the letter E?

4710
03:04:27,020 --> 03:04:28,600
All right, genius, Fumiko.

4711
03:04:28,920 --> 03:04:30,380
My mother is in the kitchen.

4712
03:04:30,620 --> 03:04:31,680
I like to read.

4713
03:04:31,980 --> 03:04:33,320
Do you have a bicycle?

4714
03:04:33,700 --> 03:04:35,240
I have a blue bicycle.

4715
03:04:35,840 --> 03:04:38,900
Star, star, star, star, star-studded student.

4716
03:04:43,520 --> 03:04:45,820
My bird is in my room.

4717
03:04:45,820 --> 03:04:47,480
I play baseball.

4718
03:04:47,840 --> 03:04:48,980
Have you a bike?

4719
03:04:51,480 --> 03:04:52,660
Have at you.

4720
03:04:56,640 --> 03:04:58,700
Yes, I have a bike.

4721
03:05:03,110 --> 03:05:04,630
I play baseball.

4722
03:05:04,810 --> 03:05:05,170
That's right.

4723
03:05:05,790 --> 03:05:08,170
My bird is in my room.

4724
03:05:13,130 --> 03:05:14,930
My brother is in the den.

4725
03:05:15,090 --> 03:05:16,450
I play video games.

4726
03:05:16,730 --> 03:05:18,030
Do you has a bike?

4727
03:05:18,390 --> 03:05:19,030
No.

4728
03:05:24,460 --> 03:05:27,860
Chat, if you have a red pikikli, please consult your doctor.

4729
03:05:30,140 --> 03:05:32,080
My brother is in the den.

4730
03:05:32,240 --> 03:05:32,620
That's good.

4731
03:05:33,020 --> 03:05:34,800
I play video games.

4732
03:05:35,340 --> 03:05:37,140
Do you has a bike?

4733
03:05:37,440 --> 03:05:37,900
Sad.

4734
03:05:38,580 --> 03:05:40,720
No cat speak here, please.

4735
03:05:41,160 --> 03:05:41,240
Okay.

4736
03:05:41,560 --> 03:05:42,360
So we graded those.

4737
03:05:43,640 --> 03:05:45,680
Our name is now in red.

4738
03:05:46,400 --> 03:05:49,500
Because the ghost is like, gotta make it real ominous.

4739
03:05:49,640 --> 03:05:49,760
Oh.

4740
03:05:50,280 --> 03:05:52,000
Have I been able to come out here this whole time?

4741
03:05:54,320 --> 03:05:55,500
What is this for?

4742
03:05:55,540 --> 03:05:56,300
We still don't know.

4743
03:05:58,320 --> 03:05:58,800
Okay.

4744
03:06:08,370 --> 03:06:09,530
Let's try calling...

4745
03:06:09,530 --> 03:06:09,990
What's his name?

4746
03:06:10,190 --> 03:06:10,550
I suppose...

4747
03:06:10,550 --> 03:06:10,810
Logan.

4748
03:06:12,290 --> 03:06:13,150
Logan speaking.

4749
03:06:13,530 --> 03:06:13,990
Oh.

4750
03:06:14,450 --> 03:06:16,250
Were you able to find a copy of the book?

4751
03:06:16,550 --> 03:06:17,230
I did.

4752
03:06:17,450 --> 03:06:20,170
But before I send it, I need to ask you another favor.

4753
03:06:20,490 --> 03:06:22,170
I want to get Bess a present.

4754
03:06:22,370 --> 03:06:22,850
Oh my god.

4755
03:06:22,870 --> 03:06:25,110
She said she was looking for the perfect outfit.

4756
03:06:25,310 --> 03:06:29,010
I think that'd be a great gift, but I have no clue what to do in a clothing store.

4757
03:06:29,210 --> 03:06:31,870
I sort of just freeze at the sight of hangers.

4758
03:06:32,050 --> 03:06:33,050
I think it's genetic.

4759
03:06:33,410 --> 03:06:33,810
This guy...

4760
03:06:33,810 --> 03:06:35,030
I'll see what I can do.

4761
03:06:35,410 --> 03:06:38,470
I know of a program that might be just the thing.

4762
03:06:39,110 --> 03:06:39,390
Great.

4763
03:06:39,710 --> 03:06:40,070
Thanks.

4764
03:06:42,810 --> 03:06:43,530
No.

4765
03:06:44,030 --> 03:06:45,030
No way.

4766
03:06:45,150 --> 03:06:45,170
Bye.

4767
03:06:45,690 --> 03:06:46,750
No way.

4768
03:06:47,110 --> 03:06:48,810
Am I gonna go...

4769
03:06:51,350 --> 03:06:52,070
What?

4770
03:06:53,770 --> 03:06:54,690
Oh god.

4771
03:06:55,030 --> 03:06:55,690
We got spooky...

4772
03:06:55,690 --> 03:06:56,670
It's spooky music time.

4773
03:06:59,530 --> 03:07:00,590
I'll be back.

4774
03:07:00,610 --> 03:07:01,950
I'm going to Yumi's place.

4775
03:07:04,130 --> 03:07:06,150
She's in Kurume.

4776
03:07:06,390 --> 03:07:09,210
But before that, maybe we go to...

4777
03:07:09,790 --> 03:07:10,310
Matsue.

4778
03:07:10,650 --> 03:07:13,710
Let's try and get another piece of the puzzle.

4779
03:07:13,870 --> 03:07:15,510
Like, I think we have to help her with the bento.

4780
03:07:15,950 --> 03:07:17,040
To get the...

4781
03:07:18,250 --> 03:07:19,970
To get the...

4782
03:07:21,910 --> 03:07:23,610
More outfits or something.

4783
03:07:25,870 --> 03:07:26,450
Hello.

4784
03:07:27,670 --> 03:07:29,610
I'm ready to help with more bento.

4785
03:07:30,610 --> 03:07:31,130
Okay.

4786
03:07:32,650 --> 03:07:34,310
Okay, this was kind of confusing.

4787
03:07:34,690 --> 03:07:35,670
Okay, let's try and remember.

4788
03:07:37,670 --> 03:07:38,090
Ouch.

4789
03:07:39,930 --> 03:07:40,450
Um...

4790
03:07:41,070 --> 03:07:41,790
Oh boy.

4791
03:07:41,990 --> 03:07:42,170
Okay.

4792
03:07:54,460 --> 03:07:55,500
Food sudoku.

4793
03:07:55,940 --> 03:07:56,140
Right.

4794
03:07:57,520 --> 03:07:58,640
I'm gonna be real.

4795
03:07:58,640 --> 03:07:59,800
It's still confusing.

4796
03:08:00,340 --> 03:08:01,480
The only thing that...

4797
03:08:01,480 --> 03:08:03,260
The thing that makes it the most confusing...

4798
03:08:03,260 --> 03:08:04,300
Is not knowing where...

4799
03:08:04,300 --> 03:08:06,820
Like, I wish they put, like, one thing for sure.

4800
03:08:06,940 --> 03:08:07,400
You know what I mean?

4801
03:08:07,900 --> 03:08:09,800
I think that would be a huge help.

4802
03:08:10,060 --> 03:08:11,140
But they just...

4803
03:08:11,140 --> 03:08:12,540
They just say...

4804
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:13,880
Good luck to you.

4805
03:08:15,760 --> 03:08:16,680
Food dooku.

4806
03:08:18,980 --> 03:08:19,460
Yes.

4807
03:08:21,560 --> 03:08:23,580
So, I feel that...

4808
03:08:23,580 --> 03:08:24,860
The only way we can do this...

4809
03:08:24,860 --> 03:08:26,240
Is have the L...

4810
03:08:26,240 --> 03:08:26,940
Here.

4811
03:08:27,100 --> 03:08:28,480
And then the square here, no?

4812
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:30,020
Yeah, otherwise...

4813
03:08:30,020 --> 03:08:30,120
Wait.

4814
03:08:30,780 --> 03:08:31,060
Yeah.

4815
03:08:31,280 --> 03:08:32,240
Otherwise it won't fit.

4816
03:08:32,240 --> 03:08:33,680
So, these two are rice.

4817
03:08:34,560 --> 03:08:36,120
So, this is...

4818
03:08:36,120 --> 03:08:38,080
Perhaps a piggy...

4819
03:08:38,080 --> 03:08:39,060
Piggy egg.

4820
03:08:40,660 --> 03:08:42,040
And piggy sandwich.

4821
03:08:42,820 --> 03:08:44,120
And a sandwich.

4822
03:08:45,180 --> 03:08:45,740
Perhaps.

4823
03:08:59,430 --> 03:08:59,990
Yeah.

4824
03:09:00,750 --> 03:09:01,990
I'm trying to think...

4825
03:09:01,990 --> 03:09:03,590
Like, you can't put this anywhere else...

4826
03:09:03,590 --> 03:09:04,370
Where it would make the...

4827
03:09:04,370 --> 03:09:05,750
Where it would work with the square.

4828
03:09:06,510 --> 03:09:07,810
Because otherwise it would...

4829
03:09:07,810 --> 03:09:08,090
Wait.

4830
03:09:08,230 --> 03:09:08,550
Hold on.

4831
03:09:11,350 --> 03:09:13,610
If you put it here...

4832
03:09:13,610 --> 03:09:14,030
Yeah.

4833
03:09:14,310 --> 03:09:15,070
It wouldn't...

4834
03:09:15,070 --> 03:09:15,570
Wait.

4835
03:09:15,790 --> 03:09:15,950
Yeah.

4836
03:09:16,030 --> 03:09:16,570
It wouldn't work.

4837
03:09:19,190 --> 03:09:20,570
What's the graph on the right mean?

4838
03:09:20,690 --> 03:09:20,850
Okay.

4839
03:09:21,390 --> 03:09:21,850
So...

4840
03:09:22,370 --> 03:09:24,190
I think I might be able to...

4841
03:09:24,190 --> 03:09:24,770
Explain it.

4842
03:09:25,030 --> 03:09:25,490
So...

4843
03:09:26,690 --> 03:09:28,370
These all show...

4844
03:09:28,370 --> 03:09:30,470
Different patterns that are in here.

4845
03:09:32,170 --> 03:09:32,990
And then...

4846
03:09:32,990 --> 03:09:34,470
This means like pig sandwich.

4847
03:09:34,710 --> 03:09:35,510
So, that's what this is.

4848
03:09:35,610 --> 03:09:36,410
The piggy sandwich.

4849
03:09:36,410 --> 03:09:37,890
And piggy egg.

4850
03:09:38,230 --> 03:09:39,030
And then...

4851
03:09:39,030 --> 03:09:40,230
Whatever is here is a sandwich.

4852
03:09:40,250 --> 03:09:42,390
But we don't know what kind of critter it is.

4853
03:09:43,950 --> 03:09:44,450
So...

4854
03:09:46,250 --> 03:09:47,250
That's basically...

4855
03:09:48,030 --> 03:09:49,270
What it means.

4856
03:09:53,590 --> 03:09:55,270
What if we had...

4857
03:09:56,450 --> 03:09:58,070
What if we had here...

4858
03:09:58,070 --> 03:09:59,310
Bear rice.

4859
03:09:59,710 --> 03:10:00,870
And then this would be...

4860
03:10:00,870 --> 03:10:02,470
This could be bear egg.

4861
03:10:02,650 --> 03:10:03,710
And then we cat cat.

4862
03:10:04,110 --> 03:10:05,490
And so it would be cat something.

4863
03:10:05,490 --> 03:10:07,590
But then cat sandwich on the bottom.

4864
03:10:07,910 --> 03:10:08,430
Oh, no.

4865
03:10:08,550 --> 03:10:09,010
We can't.

4866
03:10:09,450 --> 03:10:09,570
Oh.

4867
03:10:10,450 --> 03:10:10,890
Oh.

4868
03:10:11,130 --> 03:10:11,790
Oh, yes we can.

4869
03:10:11,990 --> 03:10:12,510
Oh, no.

4870
03:10:12,590 --> 03:10:12,990
We can't.

4871
03:10:13,210 --> 03:10:13,450
Ah!

4872
03:10:13,930 --> 03:10:14,370
No.

4873
03:10:14,550 --> 03:10:15,150
We can't do that.

4874
03:10:15,390 --> 03:10:16,910
Because this gotta be...

4875
03:10:16,910 --> 03:10:18,370
This has to...

4876
03:10:18,370 --> 03:10:18,690
Wait.

4877
03:10:20,710 --> 03:10:22,970
One of these has to be...

4878
03:10:25,530 --> 03:10:25,970
Sandwich.

4879
03:10:26,170 --> 03:10:26,670
Oh, wait.

4880
03:10:26,930 --> 03:10:27,150
How?

4881
03:10:28,030 --> 03:10:28,470
What?

4882
03:10:29,150 --> 03:10:29,630
What?

4883
03:10:30,330 --> 03:10:30,810
Huh?

4884
03:10:31,110 --> 03:10:31,410
Okay.

4885
03:10:31,550 --> 03:10:32,490
So this has to be...

4886
03:10:32,490 --> 03:10:33,230
Rice.

4887
03:10:34,170 --> 03:10:34,650
Sandwich.

4888
03:10:38,290 --> 03:10:40,150
Oh, but then...

4889
03:10:40,150 --> 03:10:40,490
Ah!

4890
03:10:46,440 --> 03:10:46,920
Okay.

4891
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:48,700
The dilemma is...

4892
03:10:51,360 --> 03:10:51,840
Wait.

4893
03:10:51,960 --> 03:10:52,040
Wait.

4894
03:10:52,180 --> 03:10:52,240
Wait.

4895
03:10:52,400 --> 03:10:52,480
Wait.

4896
03:10:52,520 --> 03:10:52,780
Wait.

4897
03:10:52,900 --> 03:10:52,960
Wait.

4898
03:10:53,120 --> 03:10:53,160
Wait.

4899
03:10:53,520 --> 03:10:54,640
It can work.

4900
03:10:55,320 --> 03:10:56,260
With this...

4901
03:10:56,260 --> 03:10:56,680
With the...

4902
03:10:56,680 --> 03:10:57,360
With the square.

4903
03:10:57,780 --> 03:10:58,080
See?

4904
03:10:58,420 --> 03:10:58,900
Or...

4905
03:10:58,900 --> 03:11:00,240
So this can be the square.

4906
03:11:00,440 --> 03:11:01,740
And then this can be the L.

4907
03:11:03,280 --> 03:11:04,760
Because the sandwich, sandwich.

4908
03:11:06,840 --> 03:11:08,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4909
03:11:08,340 --> 03:11:08,540
Okay.

4910
03:11:08,640 --> 03:11:09,720
I think that works better.

4911
03:11:13,640 --> 03:11:15,420
So this is sandwich, sandwich.

4912
03:11:16,540 --> 03:11:17,620
So, rice, rice.

4913
03:11:31,010 --> 03:11:31,410
Uh...

4914
03:11:35,440 --> 03:11:38,060
Now, which side would be the...

4915
03:11:38,060 --> 03:11:38,940
Bear, cat, cat?

4916
03:11:40,200 --> 03:11:41,160
Bear, eggy.

4917
03:11:43,100 --> 03:11:44,620
Would it be right or left?

4918
03:11:46,180 --> 03:11:47,220
Bear, eggy.

4919
03:11:48,960 --> 03:11:51,360
So the two by two block is in the upper left.

4920
03:11:59,140 --> 03:12:00,060
I suppose...

4921
03:12:00,600 --> 03:12:01,440
Does this...

4922
03:12:01,440 --> 03:12:03,940
I wonder if this egg can overlap with the bear egg.

4923
03:12:04,280 --> 03:12:04,960
You know what I mean?

4924
03:12:05,640 --> 03:12:07,880
So it would be bear, rice, here.

4925
03:12:10,120 --> 03:12:12,160
And then bear, eggy, there.

4926
03:12:12,440 --> 03:12:12,800
You know?

4927
03:12:13,040 --> 03:12:13,520
It can?

4928
03:12:13,780 --> 03:12:14,140
Ah!

4929
03:12:14,760 --> 03:12:15,400
Okay, okay.

4930
03:12:16,040 --> 03:12:17,320
And then cat, cat.

4931
03:12:17,620 --> 03:12:18,300
And then cat.

4932
03:12:18,400 --> 03:12:19,760
So cat sandwiched here.

4933
03:12:19,960 --> 03:12:21,220
And then a cat something.

4934
03:12:30,490 --> 03:12:31,850
And then this would be...

4935
03:12:35,880 --> 03:12:36,600
Oh wait.

4936
03:12:36,780 --> 03:12:37,220
Uh, piggy.

4937
03:12:37,220 --> 03:12:37,420
Piggy.

4938
03:12:41,650 --> 03:12:42,480
So this is...

4939
03:12:43,630 --> 03:12:45,270
Rice, rice, sandwich, sandwich.

4940
03:12:45,810 --> 03:12:47,470
So rice, rice, sandwich.

4941
03:12:49,750 --> 03:12:50,170
Bear.

4942
03:12:50,350 --> 03:12:52,050
And this matches the pig and the bear.

4943
03:12:52,310 --> 03:12:53,510
And then...

4944
03:12:54,050 --> 03:12:54,470
Uh...

4945
03:12:54,470 --> 03:12:56,290
Okay, now we just need to figure out.

4946
03:12:56,390 --> 03:12:56,650
Let's see.

4947
03:12:56,810 --> 03:12:57,470
Let's just put him in.

4948
03:13:02,270 --> 03:13:03,530
What did I do wrong?

4949
03:13:04,110 --> 03:13:04,530
Oh!

4950
03:13:05,330 --> 03:13:06,030
What's wrong?

4951
03:13:07,990 --> 03:13:08,650
Oh no!

4952
03:13:08,850 --> 03:13:09,730
Oh, I got the...

4953
03:13:09,730 --> 03:13:09,990
Oh!

4954
03:13:10,270 --> 03:13:11,830
I did the square wrong.

4955
03:13:12,090 --> 03:13:12,510
Oh, shoot.

4956
03:13:13,150 --> 03:13:13,450
Ah!

4957
03:13:19,710 --> 03:13:20,150
Okay.

4958
03:13:20,510 --> 03:13:22,290
So it has to be...

4959
03:13:22,290 --> 03:13:23,430
Okay, hold on.

4960
03:13:25,290 --> 03:13:25,790
Ah!

4961
03:13:27,450 --> 03:13:28,130
Oh!

4962
03:13:29,370 --> 03:13:31,330
Okay, sandwich here.

4963
03:13:37,980 --> 03:13:39,400
Bear, egg.

4964
03:13:39,860 --> 03:13:40,440
Here.

4965
03:13:41,740 --> 03:13:43,660
Other sandwich could be...

4966
03:13:44,160 --> 03:13:45,160
Bear sandwich.

4967
03:13:45,160 --> 03:13:45,440
Switch.

4968
03:13:46,520 --> 03:13:47,080
Here.

4969
03:13:48,960 --> 03:13:51,960
But then, how do we do the bear rice egg?

4970
03:13:57,700 --> 03:13:58,980
That's so confusing.

4971
03:13:59,900 --> 03:14:01,540
No, yeah, you can't rotate it.

4972
03:14:02,840 --> 03:14:05,380
So, rice bear would be bottom right.

4973
03:14:06,720 --> 03:14:07,280
Oh!

4974
03:14:08,300 --> 03:14:10,860
Yeah, because this is a piggy egg, you're right.

4975
03:14:11,440 --> 03:14:12,280
Yes, yes, yes.

4976
03:14:14,260 --> 03:14:15,520
Yes, yes, yes.

4977
03:14:16,360 --> 03:14:20,480
Then I think this would be piggy here, because it's a pig bear.

4978
03:14:22,080 --> 03:14:25,880
And then, yes, rice, egg.

4979
03:14:26,220 --> 03:14:28,000
Phew, it's busy here today.

4980
03:14:28,340 --> 03:14:28,940
Fantastic.

4981
03:14:31,720 --> 03:14:33,400
Are you going to give me anything for it?

4982
03:14:35,700 --> 03:14:38,340
Have Miwako and Rantaro been dating long?

4983
03:14:38,340 --> 03:14:40,500
It's hard to backdate that sort of thing.

4984
03:14:40,640 --> 03:14:44,180
So, let's just say they've been dating somewhere between two and a thousand years.

4985
03:14:44,580 --> 03:14:48,700
Is it just me, or do things seem a little strained between Miwako and Rantaro?

4986
03:14:49,160 --> 03:14:49,640
Do they?

4987
03:14:50,100 --> 03:14:51,940
Come on, make with the detairs.

4988
03:14:52,180 --> 03:14:53,600
Ooh, I don't really know.

4989
03:14:53,700 --> 03:14:54,900
It's just an impression.

4990
03:14:55,620 --> 03:14:56,600
Ugh, boring.

4991
03:14:56,940 --> 03:15:00,540
Nancy, if we're going to be gossip buddies, you're going to have to work on your follow-through.

4992
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:03,640
Miwako seems a little annoyed with Rantaro.

4993
03:15:03,640 --> 03:15:05,620
Well, that's not surprising.

4994
03:15:05,960 --> 03:15:07,180
Rantaro is super annoying.

4995
03:15:07,500 --> 03:15:08,620
Super, super annoying.

4996
03:15:09,020 --> 03:15:11,780
It's part of this reverse psychology bizarre charm he's got.

4997
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:16,080
When he's in one of his hyper Rantaro moods, it's like hanging out with a puppy.

4998
03:15:16,540 --> 03:15:21,180
Except Rantaro is housebroken, and he doesn't go all crazy when there's a cat outside.

4999
03:15:21,800 --> 03:15:23,400
Well, most times he doesn't.

5000
03:15:23,780 --> 03:15:24,200
Okay.

5001
03:15:26,620 --> 03:15:27,100
Um...

5002
03:15:27,100 --> 03:15:27,900
Oh my goodness.

5003
03:15:28,180 --> 03:15:29,000
Okay, there's so many things.

5004
03:15:29,240 --> 03:15:30,820
I got that picture you sent.

5005
03:15:30,940 --> 03:15:31,980
Is she going to talk about pretty good?

5006
03:15:31,980 --> 03:15:32,740
Oh, the designs.

5007
03:15:33,280 --> 03:15:34,800
I did it at the Purikura booth.

5008
03:15:35,060 --> 03:15:36,280
They're everywhere around here.

5009
03:15:36,500 --> 03:15:40,620
They're these picture booths, and you get to choose decorations, and you can write out your own messages.

5010
03:15:42,380 --> 03:15:44,240
Oh, that sounds...

5011
03:15:44,240 --> 03:15:45,280
I don't get it.

5012
03:15:45,440 --> 03:15:46,180
I don't get it.

5013
03:15:46,640 --> 03:15:47,700
There's not much to get.

5014
03:15:47,820 --> 03:15:48,560
It's just for fun.

5015
03:15:48,780 --> 03:15:51,280
Some people use them like notes or something, but...

5016
03:15:51,280 --> 03:15:51,500
Mosturi.

5017
03:15:51,740 --> 03:15:53,460
It's just something to do when you're out with friends.

5018
03:15:55,160 --> 03:15:56,000
Oh, Yumi.

5019
03:15:56,320 --> 03:15:56,900
Oh, Yumi.

5020
03:15:57,380 --> 03:16:01,480
Okay, I'm going to save before we talk about what happened to the mom, just in case we die.

5021
03:16:01,480 --> 03:16:03,280
The article about what happened to your mother.

5022
03:16:04,100 --> 03:16:04,920
I'm busy.

5023
03:16:05,160 --> 03:16:06,200
Maybe you should go.

5024
03:16:06,440 --> 03:16:08,620
It said that you were the first one to find her.

5025
03:16:09,140 --> 03:16:10,680
That must have been very hard.

5026
03:16:11,100 --> 03:16:12,620
I said I'm busy.

5027
03:16:12,880 --> 03:16:15,200
That means leave me alone.

5028
03:16:16,040 --> 03:16:16,220
Now.

5029
03:16:16,520 --> 03:16:17,020
Nancy!

5030
03:16:17,840 --> 03:16:19,460
Oh my god.

5031
03:16:21,960 --> 03:16:23,160
Can you come back in a bit?

5032
03:16:23,300 --> 03:16:24,140
Oh, we made her mad.

5033
03:16:24,360 --> 03:16:24,480
Okay.

5034
03:16:28,460 --> 03:16:29,460
Nancy Drew.

5035
03:16:30,800 --> 03:16:32,000
Good lord.

5036
03:16:38,960 --> 03:16:40,680
We gotta find clothes?

5037
03:16:41,380 --> 03:16:43,300
Maybe if we go to...

5038
03:16:43,300 --> 03:16:46,780
Maybe let's go to Yumi's house and raid her closet.

5039
03:16:47,840 --> 03:16:48,440
Kawakaze!

5040
03:16:48,680 --> 03:16:49,260
Welcome to membership!

5041
03:16:49,500 --> 03:16:49,980
Thank you!

5042
03:16:51,100 --> 03:16:52,840
Let's raid her closet.

5043
03:16:53,040 --> 03:16:54,140
Maybe that will be...

5044
03:16:54,140 --> 03:16:55,340
What we need.

5045
03:16:55,920 --> 03:16:56,280
Maybe?

5046
03:17:01,920 --> 03:17:02,640
Nancy die.

5047
03:17:02,660 --> 03:17:03,880
I need to translate that.

5048
03:17:04,160 --> 03:17:04,760
Nancy die.

5049
03:17:10,480 --> 03:17:11,420
Oh yeah, that's right.

5050
03:17:11,500 --> 03:17:12,200
We gotta make the avatar.

5051
03:17:12,380 --> 03:17:12,620
Thank you.

5052
03:17:13,040 --> 03:17:14,040
Thank you for reminding me.

5053
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:20,160
Which one do you think she would like?

5054
03:17:24,980 --> 03:17:26,140
What was the phone number?

5055
03:17:30,440 --> 03:17:30,840
Savannah.

5056
03:17:32,980 --> 03:17:33,380
404...

5057
03:17:36,660 --> 03:17:37,060
555...

5058
03:17:43,930 --> 03:17:44,330
4478.

5059
03:17:50,110 --> 03:17:50,690
Which one...

5060
03:17:50,690 --> 03:17:51,590
Maybe we'll just send it...

5061
03:17:51,590 --> 03:17:51,910
What was it?

5062
03:17:54,470 --> 03:17:55,270
404-555...

5063
03:18:01,490 --> 03:18:03,590
I can't remember this.

5064
03:18:04,810 --> 03:18:05,590
4478.

5065
03:18:09,790 --> 03:18:10,570
Okay.

5066
03:18:11,130 --> 03:18:11,670
Alright.

5067
03:18:13,990 --> 03:18:17,070
We didn't get any new outfits or anything.

5068
03:18:17,590 --> 03:18:18,370
So...

5069
03:18:18,370 --> 03:18:19,330
We're fine.

5070
03:18:20,390 --> 03:18:20,690
Okay.

5071
03:18:21,670 --> 03:18:23,010
Oh, I think he liked it.

5072
03:18:23,650 --> 03:18:24,810
Thanks, Nancy!

5073
03:18:27,570 --> 03:18:30,150
You are so welcome.

5074
03:18:30,450 --> 03:18:32,050
And Bess, I'm so sorry.

5075
03:18:36,290 --> 03:18:37,970
Bess, I'm really sorry.

5076
03:18:39,070 --> 03:18:41,810
Logan, you are so welcome.

5077
03:18:43,650 --> 03:18:44,910
Ivan, welcome to membership.

5078
03:18:45,110 --> 03:18:46,110
Thank you so much.

5079
03:18:47,430 --> 03:18:48,810
Does that mean he sent the book?

5080
03:18:48,830 --> 03:18:49,690
I sure hope so.

5081
03:18:53,660 --> 03:18:55,420
Oh, I can't talk to him here.

5082
03:18:58,320 --> 03:18:59,860
It's almost twi- It's almost midnight.

5083
03:18:59,900 --> 03:19:02,900
I'm gonna call him anyway, because Nancy Drew knows no boundaries.

5084
03:19:03,420 --> 03:19:04,040
I'm gonna call him.

5085
03:19:04,780 --> 03:19:07,540
Nancy, I got the picture you sent.

5086
03:19:07,740 --> 03:19:12,320
I'm going to take it to that boutique she mentioned, and let them do whatever it is they do.

5087
03:19:12,820 --> 03:19:13,140
Good.

5088
03:19:13,400 --> 03:19:14,740
So you'll be sending the book?

5089
03:19:14,960 --> 03:19:15,320
Yeah.

5090
03:19:15,820 --> 03:19:22,940
I was thinking I'd give it to Bess, like, hey, here's that book you want, and since I'm here, let's get dinner, and I got you a present.

5091
03:19:22,940 --> 03:19:23,300
Oh.

5092
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:25,000
Whatever works.

5093
03:19:25,200 --> 03:19:27,440
But the sooner I get that book, the better.

5094
03:19:28,180 --> 03:19:28,820
Talk to you later.

5095
03:19:28,840 --> 03:19:29,920
I'll talk to you later.

5096
03:19:30,380 --> 03:19:30,720
Bye.

5097
03:19:31,020 --> 03:19:31,440
Bye.

5098
03:19:33,340 --> 03:19:35,820
Alright, Nancy Drew goes to sleep.

5099
03:19:36,920 --> 03:19:38,560
In our haunted, haunted room.

5100
03:19:38,760 --> 03:19:38,920
Alright.

5101
03:19:39,940 --> 03:19:42,000
Let's set an alarm for...

5102
03:19:42,540 --> 03:19:43,040
7pm?

5103
03:19:45,440 --> 03:19:47,280
I don't think there's anything else I can do.

5104
03:19:47,500 --> 03:19:48,120
I don't know.

5105
03:19:50,440 --> 03:19:52,020
I can't get into the room.

5106
03:19:53,740 --> 03:19:55,600
I feel... I feel a little stuck.

5107
03:19:57,120 --> 03:19:57,600
Besides...

5108
03:19:58,800 --> 03:19:59,280
Besides...

5109
03:20:00,040 --> 03:20:01,180
Just... the things...

5110
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:03,100
It's really late.

5111
03:20:03,280 --> 03:20:04,280
I should get to bed.

5112
03:20:04,400 --> 03:20:06,360
Besides like this... the one thing with the book.

5113
03:20:06,880 --> 03:20:07,440
You know?

5114
03:20:09,240 --> 03:20:09,720
7pm?

5115
03:20:09,920 --> 03:20:13,120
Yeah, we have to set it to PM because Nancy works in the mornings.

5116
03:20:14,380 --> 03:20:16,940
And she won't let you set an alarm for it.

5117
03:20:18,660 --> 03:20:19,140
Oh!

5118
03:20:19,560 --> 03:20:20,280
Moshi Moshi.

5119
03:20:20,600 --> 03:20:22,120
We didn't... we didn't get our alarm.

5120
03:20:22,120 --> 03:20:23,240
Nancy, we've got the book.

5121
03:20:23,640 --> 03:20:24,040
Great!

5122
03:20:24,520 --> 03:20:25,580
So when do we see you?

5123
03:20:25,820 --> 03:20:26,680
We'll give you the book.

5124
03:20:27,280 --> 03:20:29,440
Well, I'm a little wrapped up right now.

5125
03:20:29,880 --> 03:20:32,700
George, did we have a friend named Nancy Drew once?

5126
03:20:33,300 --> 03:20:34,300
I think so.

5127
03:20:34,460 --> 03:20:34,980
Hard to say.

5128
03:20:35,080 --> 03:20:36,060
The name sounds familiar.

5129
03:20:36,440 --> 03:20:38,400
Was she the one with the magnifying glass or something?

5130
03:20:38,960 --> 03:20:39,360
Hey!

5131
03:20:40,440 --> 03:20:41,240
Just teasing.

5132
03:20:41,740 --> 03:20:42,820
We'll send you the book.

5133
03:20:43,100 --> 03:20:46,360
The faster you solve the mystery, the faster the three of us get to hit the town.

5134
03:20:46,360 --> 03:20:46,680
Yeah.

5135
03:20:46,960 --> 03:20:47,260
Thanks.

5136
03:20:47,660 --> 03:20:48,820
You know I can't wait.

5137
03:20:49,200 --> 03:20:49,700
No problem.

5138
03:20:49,900 --> 03:20:50,420
Anything else?

5139
03:20:51,020 --> 03:20:54,320
So, Bess, what's the story with you and Logan?

5140
03:20:54,500 --> 03:20:54,520
We're gonna get the tea?

5141
03:20:54,520 --> 03:20:54,900
The tea?

5142
03:20:55,160 --> 03:20:57,200
Well, he asked me out on a date.

5143
03:20:57,740 --> 03:20:59,400
See what I put up with for you?

5144
03:20:59,880 --> 03:21:00,940
Such a liar!

5145
03:21:01,260 --> 03:21:01,280
Oh?

5146
03:21:01,440 --> 03:21:02,720
Nancy, she's such a liar!

5147
03:21:02,740 --> 03:21:03,380
Is she being tsundere?

5148
03:21:11,260 --> 03:21:12,340
What is she talking about?

5149
03:21:14,160 --> 03:21:16,920
She looked like an anime character with the big eyes.

5150
03:21:18,200 --> 03:21:21,620
We're going out again as soon as he's done researching the expo for Savannah.

5151
03:21:21,640 --> 03:21:22,340
Oh my god!

5152
03:21:22,800 --> 03:21:27,320
So, maybe you could put in a word with her about giving her assistant a break?

5153
03:21:28,020 --> 03:21:29,520
I'll see what I can do.

5154
03:21:30,120 --> 03:21:30,580
Wow.

5155
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:31,200
Okay.

5156
03:21:31,200 --> 03:21:32,680
I'll stop bugging you now.

5157
03:21:32,900 --> 03:21:33,320
Bye!

5158
03:21:33,680 --> 03:21:34,020
Bye!

5159
03:21:35,140 --> 03:21:37,980
I still feel like we have so much left to do in this game.

5160
03:21:38,160 --> 03:21:39,560
And I really want to beat it today.

5161
03:21:39,780 --> 03:21:40,980
I don't know if that's gonna happen.

5162
03:21:42,780 --> 03:21:44,580
I really wanted to beat it today!

5163
03:21:45,120 --> 03:21:45,780
We'll see.

5164
03:21:47,060 --> 03:21:47,620
Oh, whoops.

5165
03:21:48,540 --> 03:21:48,980
Uh...

5166
03:21:48,980 --> 03:21:49,320
Hi!

5167
03:21:49,880 --> 03:21:50,900
I'll let you go.

5168
03:21:51,040 --> 03:21:51,380
Nevermind.

5169
03:21:51,520 --> 03:21:51,800
See you later.

5170
03:21:54,240 --> 03:21:54,680
Um...

5171
03:21:55,760 --> 03:21:57,440
Okay, things we got in our inventory.

5172
03:21:57,440 --> 03:22:00,760
We have the key to Yumi's apartment.

5173
03:22:01,620 --> 03:22:03,320
The magnetic key.

5174
03:22:04,140 --> 03:22:05,400
Maybe something with that.

5175
03:22:10,640 --> 03:22:11,560
Uh...

5176
03:22:13,500 --> 03:22:14,420
Hmm...

5177
03:22:18,470 --> 03:22:19,490
Oh...

5178
03:22:20,290 --> 03:22:22,090
The comic book.

5179
03:22:23,250 --> 03:22:25,090
Let's go talk with Grandma.

5180
03:22:25,090 --> 03:22:25,730
Grandma.

5181
03:22:25,730 --> 03:22:26,210
Oh, whoops.

5182
03:22:33,890 --> 03:22:34,450
Grandma.

5183
03:22:35,010 --> 03:22:35,990
Hello, Nancy-san.

5184
03:22:36,250 --> 03:22:38,570
Did you rewrite my name in red ink?

5185
03:22:38,970 --> 03:22:40,090
What do you mean?

5186
03:22:40,730 --> 03:22:42,410
The name scroll in my room.

5187
03:22:42,590 --> 03:22:43,430
It's red now.

5188
03:22:43,590 --> 03:22:44,730
Yeah, very ominous.

5189
03:22:45,230 --> 03:22:45,490
It's...

5190
03:22:45,490 --> 03:22:46,870
It's nothing to worry about.

5191
03:22:47,250 --> 03:22:48,510
I'll have it removed.

5192
03:22:51,010 --> 03:22:51,290
Uh...

5193
03:22:51,570 --> 03:22:54,170
Isn't it a bad omen to have your name written in red?

5194
03:22:54,190 --> 03:22:55,330
Yeah, someone's trying to curse me.

5195
03:22:55,910 --> 03:22:57,950
Just don't worry about it.

5196
03:22:58,150 --> 03:22:58,910
It is nothing.

5197
03:22:59,450 --> 03:23:01,610
Can I help you with anything else?

5198
03:23:02,010 --> 03:23:03,650
I'll let you get back to work.

5199
03:23:04,110 --> 03:23:04,510
Goodbye.

5200
03:23:05,330 --> 03:23:06,770
Goodbye, Grandma.

5201
03:23:08,370 --> 03:23:09,510
Grandma Mal.

5202
03:23:11,630 --> 03:23:12,610
Mm-hmm.

5203
03:23:13,750 --> 03:23:15,890
Okay, let's go talk to everybody that we can, I suppose.

5204
03:23:19,110 --> 03:23:19,410
Wait.

5205
03:23:20,850 --> 03:23:21,550
Oh, sorry.

5206
03:23:21,630 --> 03:23:22,750
I thought it had something on...

5207
03:23:22,750 --> 03:23:23,190
on it.

5208
03:23:24,490 --> 03:23:25,250
But no...

5209
03:23:25,810 --> 03:23:26,810
It does not.

5210
03:23:27,170 --> 03:23:27,390
Hey.

5211
03:23:28,010 --> 03:23:28,710
Oh, never mind.

5212
03:23:29,210 --> 03:23:30,390
I'll let you get back to work.

5213
03:23:30,410 --> 03:23:32,270
Okay, I guess let's go talk to Yumi again.

5214
03:23:34,050 --> 03:23:34,430
Bye.

5215
03:23:34,850 --> 03:23:36,270
Let's go talk to Yumi.

5216
03:23:37,030 --> 03:23:38,470
Can I talk to her from the phone?

5217
03:23:39,490 --> 03:23:41,450
Do I have to go all the way to her place?

5218
03:23:42,370 --> 03:23:43,890
Can I ask her everything on the phone?

5219
03:23:45,230 --> 03:23:48,940
Oh my god!

5220
03:23:48,940 --> 03:23:49,380
Not here.

5221
03:23:49,900 --> 03:23:50,400
Bye.

5222
03:23:54,020 --> 03:23:55,140
Not in.

5223
03:23:55,700 --> 03:23:56,580
Bye-bye.

5224
03:23:57,460 --> 03:23:58,180
What was it?

5225
03:23:58,240 --> 03:23:58,400
Kure?

5226
03:23:59,540 --> 03:24:02,650
Things that...

5227
03:24:02,650 --> 03:24:03,150
Oh, no.

5228
03:24:03,310 --> 03:24:04,030
That's Pachinko.

5229
03:24:07,150 --> 03:24:08,310
It is...

5230
03:24:08,310 --> 03:24:09,470
Matsue.

5231
03:24:11,370 --> 03:24:11,950
Goodbye.

5232
03:24:13,750 --> 03:24:14,330
Bink.

5233
03:24:18,980 --> 03:24:19,860
Bink, bink, bink.

5234
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:20,340
Hello.

5235
03:24:20,960 --> 03:24:21,280
Hello.

5236
03:24:21,880 --> 03:24:23,520
Do you see Rantaro much?

5237
03:24:23,800 --> 03:24:24,360
Oh, yeah.

5238
03:24:24,580 --> 03:24:25,540
He loves the city.

5239
03:24:25,740 --> 03:24:27,020
He's here every chance he can get.

5240
03:24:27,180 --> 03:24:27,420
Aha.

5241
03:24:27,420 --> 03:24:29,400
Do you know why he's so eager to move to the city?

5242
03:24:29,720 --> 03:24:31,080
Oh, he's been that way forever.

5243
03:24:31,420 --> 03:24:34,760
When we were kids, he and I used to jump on the train the second my mom turned her back.

5244
03:24:34,900 --> 03:24:36,520
We weren't supposed to go into the city unsupervised.

5245
03:24:37,120 --> 03:24:40,400
So, miss, I'd rather break a bone than Arura Miwako never came.

5246
03:24:41,020 --> 03:24:41,420
Ordo.

5247
03:24:41,920 --> 03:24:43,280
Maybe she was right about that.

5248
03:24:43,520 --> 03:24:45,300
We got in so much trouble every time.

5249
03:24:46,060 --> 03:24:46,720
I see.

5250
03:24:47,680 --> 03:24:49,960
Do you believe that the Ria Khan is haunted?

5251
03:24:50,380 --> 03:24:50,960
I do.

5252
03:24:51,600 --> 03:24:52,680
It's not just haunted.

5253
03:24:53,020 --> 03:24:55,600
There's something else strange going on there.

5254
03:24:55,600 --> 03:24:57,000
What do you mean?

5255
03:24:57,800 --> 03:24:57,820
Look.

5256
03:24:58,340 --> 03:24:59,600
I don't want to freak you out.

5257
03:24:59,780 --> 03:25:04,840
But between you and me, the haunting is nothing compared to some of the other strange stuff going on over there.

5258
03:25:05,160 --> 03:25:07,880
Last time I visited, it was Rait at night.

5259
03:25:08,120 --> 03:25:10,660
And I was out in the garden and something was off.

5260
03:25:11,180 --> 03:25:12,380
I could just fear it.

5261
03:25:12,380 --> 03:25:12,900
Oh?

5262
03:25:12,920 --> 03:25:15,380
All of a sudden, there was this loud shriek.

5263
03:25:15,500 --> 03:25:16,860
And this thrash of right.

5264
03:25:17,140 --> 03:25:17,520
Oh?

5265
03:25:18,300 --> 03:25:22,320
And then, Nancy Drew, I saw aliens.

5266
03:25:22,720 --> 03:25:22,940
Oh.

5267
03:25:23,360 --> 03:25:24,080
Dozens of them.

5268
03:25:24,440 --> 03:25:27,080
They had come to visit Arura of their ghost friends.

5269
03:25:27,340 --> 03:25:27,500
Oh.

5270
03:25:27,800 --> 03:25:28,660
Okay, I get it.

5271
03:25:28,780 --> 03:25:30,160
You don't believe in haunting.

5272
03:25:30,340 --> 03:25:31,480
Wasting my time, Yumi.

5273
03:25:31,760 --> 03:25:31,780
I didn't even don't.

5274
03:25:31,900 --> 03:25:32,200
Sorry.

5275
03:25:32,680 --> 03:25:33,840
How would you rate the haunting?

5276
03:25:34,160 --> 03:25:35,900
It's a pretty solid haunting, yeah.

5277
03:25:35,900 --> 03:25:36,480
Your mother...

5278
03:25:36,480 --> 03:25:39,100
I told you I didn't want to talk about that.

5279
03:25:39,180 --> 03:25:39,420
Nancy!

5280
03:25:39,800 --> 03:25:40,140
Nancy!

5281
03:25:40,320 --> 03:25:41,480
Nancy, you're ruining...

5282
03:25:41,480 --> 03:25:42,080
Okay, phew.

5283
03:25:42,560 --> 03:25:45,500
Do you know what Rintaro wants to do once he moves to Kyoto?

5284
03:25:45,960 --> 03:25:46,820
Tech something?

5285
03:25:47,320 --> 03:25:49,960
I sort of don't listen to him when he's being boring about things.

5286
03:25:50,460 --> 03:25:50,780
Okay.

5287
03:25:51,340 --> 03:25:51,660
Alright.

5288
03:25:52,540 --> 03:25:54,420
We've talked to her with everything.

5289
03:25:54,520 --> 03:25:55,400
I kind of want to do another bento.

5290
03:25:55,400 --> 03:25:56,000
I'm ready to help with more bento.

5291
03:25:56,000 --> 03:25:57,200
These ones are actually kind of fun.

5292
03:25:57,560 --> 03:25:58,460
I'm not gonna lie...

5293
03:25:58,460 --> 03:25:59,500
Oh, wow!

5294
03:25:59,840 --> 03:26:00,580
Wait, what?

5295
03:26:01,100 --> 03:26:01,940
Oh, wow!

5296
03:26:02,640 --> 03:26:03,680
Okay, wow!

5297
03:26:03,980 --> 03:26:05,700
This is like the most complex one we've gotten.

5298
03:26:05,700 --> 03:26:06,620
And...

5299
03:26:06,620 --> 03:26:07,120
Wow!

5300
03:26:07,880 --> 03:26:09,360
So middle...

5301
03:26:09,360 --> 03:26:10,900
Is cat rice.

5302
03:26:12,380 --> 03:26:13,160
Okay.

5303
03:26:13,720 --> 03:26:15,580
This shouldn't be so bad, actually.

5304
03:26:15,760 --> 03:26:16,020
Probably.

5305
03:26:17,600 --> 03:26:18,640
Maybe...

5306
03:26:18,640 --> 03:26:19,160
I guess.

5307
03:26:19,940 --> 03:26:20,980
Um...

5308
03:26:20,980 --> 03:26:22,580
Maybe this is cat egg.

5309
03:26:23,540 --> 03:26:25,060
And then...

5310
03:26:25,260 --> 03:26:26,460
Rice bunny bunny.

5311
03:26:27,600 --> 03:26:29,700
So bear rice...

5312
03:26:31,320 --> 03:26:32,340
Bunny sandwich.

5313
03:26:37,780 --> 03:26:38,220
Um...

5314
03:26:38,220 --> 03:26:39,100
Bunny something.

5315
03:26:44,680 --> 03:26:45,120
Maybe...

5316
03:26:45,920 --> 03:26:46,360
Maybe...

5317
03:26:47,260 --> 03:26:47,700
Uh...

5318
03:26:47,700 --> 03:26:48,540
Uh...

5319
03:26:48,540 --> 03:26:48,720
Uh...

5320
03:26:48,720 --> 03:26:49,400
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

5321
03:26:49,500 --> 03:26:50,620
Maybe cat sandwich.

5322
03:26:52,880 --> 03:26:53,320
Bear...

5323
03:26:54,580 --> 03:26:56,560
This has gotta be egg bunny maybe.

5324
03:26:58,100 --> 03:26:59,500
No, wait, I messed up.

5325
03:26:59,580 --> 03:26:59,720
Oh.

5326
03:26:59,840 --> 03:27:00,200
I don't know.

5327
03:27:00,480 --> 03:27:00,700
Ah!

5328
03:27:01,100 --> 03:27:01,280
Ah!

5329
03:27:01,660 --> 03:27:01,920
Ah!

5330
03:27:02,240 --> 03:27:02,380
Ah!

5331
03:27:02,380 --> 03:27:02,420
Ah!

5332
03:27:02,420 --> 03:27:02,480
Ah!

5333
03:27:02,600 --> 03:27:02,880
Ah!

5334
03:27:03,400 --> 03:27:03,840
Ah!

5335
03:27:03,840 --> 03:27:04,160
Bunny egg.

5336
03:27:04,300 --> 03:27:05,860
Wait, which one's gotta be bunny egg?

5337
03:27:06,100 --> 03:27:07,480
I still don't get this puzzle.

5338
03:27:07,640 --> 03:27:11,080
I get it, but it takes a second.

5339
03:27:11,520 --> 03:27:12,740
It does take a second.

5340
03:27:13,580 --> 03:27:15,060
Bottom left is bunny egg.

5341
03:27:15,520 --> 03:27:16,400
How do you know?

5342
03:27:18,620 --> 03:27:20,060
Oh, bunny bunny.

5343
03:27:20,620 --> 03:27:20,760
Wait.

5344
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:22,240
Oh, because the bunny bunny.

5345
03:27:22,660 --> 03:27:23,800
This or the egg egg.

5346
03:27:23,980 --> 03:27:25,000
Sorry, not bunny bunny.

5347
03:27:26,100 --> 03:27:27,040
Eggie eggie.

5348
03:27:28,040 --> 03:27:29,800
Unless this is the eggie eggie.

5349
03:27:31,220 --> 03:27:32,440
This could switch.

5350
03:27:33,200 --> 03:27:33,720
Perhaps.

5351
03:27:33,840 --> 03:27:34,020
Oops.

5352
03:27:35,880 --> 03:27:37,240
This could switch, maybe.

5353
03:27:38,080 --> 03:27:39,460
I'll have a hint with the two eggs.

5354
03:27:39,680 --> 03:27:39,860
Yeah.

5355
03:27:40,080 --> 03:27:42,280
Because it could either be these two or these two.

5356
03:27:43,080 --> 03:27:46,080
And then this would be bear, rice, bunny bunny.

5357
03:27:46,800 --> 03:27:49,620
And then bear, rabbit.

5358
03:27:52,960 --> 03:27:53,860
And then, ugh.

5359
03:27:54,340 --> 03:27:55,000
But this one.

5360
03:27:55,300 --> 03:27:56,420
This one I don't know.

5361
03:27:57,260 --> 03:27:57,780
Oh, wait.

5362
03:27:58,180 --> 03:28:00,880
Ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, bear.

5363
03:28:01,880 --> 03:28:02,320
Bear.

5364
03:28:07,590 --> 03:28:08,330
I don't know.

5365
03:28:10,750 --> 03:28:11,130
Ew.

5366
03:28:20,010 --> 03:28:22,070
I don't quite understand it, but I did it.

5367
03:28:24,150 --> 03:28:25,790
I don't understand it, but I did it.

5368
03:28:25,870 --> 03:28:26,790
Please give me things.

5369
03:28:28,050 --> 03:28:28,170
Okay.

5370
03:28:28,230 --> 03:28:28,530
Never mind.

5371
03:28:28,690 --> 03:28:29,270
One more.

5372
03:28:29,270 --> 03:28:30,950
One more, one more.

5373
03:28:32,570 --> 03:28:34,190
One more, one more, one more.

5374
03:28:38,590 --> 03:28:40,030
Are these... these are separate?

5375
03:28:40,410 --> 03:28:41,450
Or... these are all... okay.

5376
03:28:44,610 --> 03:28:45,990
Oh, this one's confusing.

5377
03:28:46,350 --> 03:28:47,130
Oh, gosh.

5378
03:28:48,410 --> 03:28:49,530
I'm into working for free.

5379
03:28:49,690 --> 03:28:50,070
I know!

5380
03:28:59,610 --> 03:29:00,550
Okay, nevermind.

5381
03:29:01,070 --> 03:29:02,490
I'll stop bugging you now.

5382
03:29:02,770 --> 03:29:03,790
Okay, see ya!

5383
03:29:05,790 --> 03:29:07,230
Wasted too much time on puzzles.

5384
03:29:13,070 --> 03:29:13,510
But...

5385
03:29:15,370 --> 03:29:17,390
Maybe when we get back to...

5386
03:29:18,790 --> 03:29:20,810
the hotel, we'll have the book, finally.

5387
03:29:21,510 --> 03:29:23,210
Maybe we just needed to leave for a bit.

5388
03:29:25,730 --> 03:29:27,530
Can we have a nonogram as a treat?

5389
03:29:27,910 --> 03:29:28,830
Did I do all of them?

5390
03:29:28,830 --> 03:29:30,810
I have a delivery for you.

5391
03:29:30,810 --> 03:29:31,010
Nice!

5392
03:29:31,150 --> 03:29:31,330
Here!

5393
03:29:31,830 --> 03:29:32,470
Thank you!

5394
03:29:33,630 --> 03:29:34,190
Awesome.

5395
03:29:34,890 --> 03:29:38,830
Do you remember anything about Savannah, the paranormal author?

5396
03:29:39,190 --> 03:29:40,650
That was a long time ago.

5397
03:29:41,050 --> 03:29:41,970
Not really.

5398
03:29:42,670 --> 03:29:46,310
She must have been here for a while if she was writing about the ryokan.

5399
03:29:46,670 --> 03:29:48,370
You don't remember anything?

5400
03:29:48,370 --> 03:29:52,190
I remember that she asked too many insensitive questions.

5401
03:29:52,430 --> 03:29:54,250
I was happy to see her go.

5402
03:29:54,350 --> 03:29:55,630
This just sounds...

5403
03:29:56,250 --> 03:29:56,810
Sounds...

5404
03:29:56,810 --> 03:29:58,350
I'll let you get back to work.

5405
03:29:58,430 --> 03:29:59,970
You think Miwako hates us?

5406
03:30:02,110 --> 03:30:02,570
Uh-oh.

5407
03:30:03,510 --> 03:30:04,370
Uh... this one.

5408
03:30:05,830 --> 03:30:06,310
Bess.

5409
03:30:06,910 --> 03:30:08,470
Usually I bring flowers on a first date.

5410
03:30:08,630 --> 03:30:10,930
But this time I brought a creepy book about ghosts.

5411
03:30:11,230 --> 03:30:13,730
I hope your friend wasn't kidding about you wanting this book.

5412
03:30:13,910 --> 03:30:17,070
Because otherwise this date will probably be weird for the both of us, Logan.

5413
03:30:19,170 --> 03:30:19,650
Alright.

5414
03:30:20,770 --> 03:30:21,730
Chapter 6.

5415
03:30:22,090 --> 03:30:24,030
The Ryokan Hiei.

5416
03:30:24,330 --> 03:30:27,730
Japan to a girl who grew up barefoot on the French porch...

5417
03:30:27,730 --> 03:30:28,130
Fr...

5418
03:30:28,130 --> 03:30:28,970
Front...

5419
03:30:30,370 --> 03:30:32,910
Front porch of a creaky old house in Savannah.

5420
03:30:33,230 --> 03:30:36,030
It's just about the most exotic place there is on earth.

5421
03:30:38,790 --> 03:30:46,030
Sometimes in the middle of a stormy night when the wind is whistling and the tree branches are scratching at the windows, I feel like I am back at the Ryokan...

5422
03:30:46,030 --> 03:30:47,750
The Ryokan Hiei.

5423
03:30:47,990 --> 03:30:48,350
Stop!

5424
03:30:48,350 --> 03:30:50,150
I didn't say French porch!

5425
03:30:52,330 --> 03:30:58,450
On those nights, I often wish I had never visited that charming looking inn on the outskirts of Kyoto.

5426
03:30:59,390 --> 03:31:04,270
The second I stepped inside the Ryokan's gate, I suddenly understood why I had been called in.

5427
03:31:04,470 --> 03:31:08,850
For those of you who have never been in a haunted place, the feeling is unmistakable.

5428
03:31:09,150 --> 03:31:13,090
Imagine the sensation of taking a rickety rollercoaster through a dense fog.

5429
03:31:13,270 --> 03:31:15,090
Now multiply that by tenfold.

5430
03:31:15,090 --> 03:31:18,910
Do note, she just said she grew up on the front porch.

5431
03:31:19,850 --> 03:31:20,330
Hm?

5432
03:31:21,170 --> 03:31:22,170
What's wrong with that?

5433
03:31:23,070 --> 03:31:26,530
The atmosphere inside the Ryokan, however, was even thicker.

5434
03:31:26,930 --> 03:31:32,450
The inn was washed in an unearthly sense of cold that the fire pit in the lobby couldn't touch.

5435
03:31:32,450 --> 03:31:34,630
Or it was winter.

5436
03:31:35,110 --> 03:31:37,770
The whole structure radiated uncertainty and dread.

5437
03:31:38,410 --> 03:31:39,870
Something terrible lived there.

5438
03:31:40,290 --> 03:31:43,770
The inn was, and still is, run by a truly wonderful family.

5439
03:31:43,770 --> 03:31:46,190
Takai and her grandmother, Miwako...

5440
03:31:46,190 --> 03:31:47,130
Oh, sorry.

5441
03:31:47,490 --> 03:31:53,950
Takai and her granddaughter, Miwako, took excellent care of Logan and I.

5442
03:31:54,070 --> 03:31:58,350
But were both extremely tight-lipped about the history of the Ryokan.

5443
03:31:58,350 --> 03:32:01,350
A neighbor boy, Rintarno.

5444
03:32:02,550 --> 03:32:02,570
Rintarno.

5445
03:32:05,620 --> 03:32:06,680
Oh, I know.

5446
03:32:07,040 --> 03:32:07,440
I was shook.

5447
03:32:07,580 --> 03:32:09,000
There's Rintarno over there.

5448
03:32:10,060 --> 03:32:10,780
Rintarno over there.

5449
03:32:15,000 --> 03:32:18,940
No wonder he's so bitter about it.

5450
03:32:19,980 --> 03:32:21,460
No wonder he wants to leave.

5451
03:32:28,140 --> 03:32:34,360
Rintarno was able to shed a little light on the situation.

5452
03:32:35,340 --> 03:32:40,440
The innkeeper's daughter, Kasumi, had recently died under mysterious circumstances.

5453
03:32:41,020 --> 03:32:44,660
Ever since her death, the inn began to change rapidly for the worse.

5454
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:47,740
Takai had begun to worry about her daughter's yurei.

5455
03:32:48,340 --> 03:32:51,440
Worry that her daughter's yurei was haunting Ryokan.

5456
03:32:51,660 --> 03:32:53,440
I set up my equipment right away.

5457
03:32:53,680 --> 03:32:57,500
Luckily, I had my entire EVP kit at the ready.

5458
03:32:58,280 --> 03:32:58,840
Ahem.

5459
03:32:59,940 --> 03:33:09,880
EVP, or electronic voice phenomenon, is a process of recording ambient room noise using very sensitive microphones in hopes of capturing the sounds of the spirit world that are too quiet to hear unaided.

5460
03:33:10,160 --> 03:33:16,940
EVP equipment can also be beneficial to debunk false hauntings, as it often picks up conversations and other telltale signs of trickery.

5461
03:33:18,340 --> 03:33:20,360
Super excited to hear you want to get into Gundam!

5462
03:33:21,080 --> 03:33:26,040
Watch the OG series for Max Brain Rot, as the whole franchise has OG Brain Rot, and it's my V-Day.

5463
03:33:26,400 --> 03:33:27,940
One minute hero, happy birthday!

5464
03:33:28,940 --> 03:33:29,800
Yeah, I...

5465
03:33:31,200 --> 03:33:33,120
I wanted to start at the beginning.

5466
03:33:33,340 --> 03:33:34,500
Is that how we hear you speak?

5467
03:33:34,680 --> 03:33:36,160
Yeah, pretty much, yeah.

5468
03:33:36,660 --> 03:33:37,120
Mm-hmm.

5469
03:33:39,280 --> 03:33:40,320
Yes, yes, yes.

5470
03:33:40,800 --> 03:33:45,040
I placed the microphones in place- in places where I felt the greatest disturbances.

5471
03:33:45,320 --> 03:33:46,940
By the fire pit in the lobby.

5472
03:33:47,180 --> 03:33:49,060
Behind the old cherry tree in the gardens.

5473
03:33:49,400 --> 03:33:52,240
By both baths, and in the upstairs hallways.

5474
03:33:53,720 --> 03:33:56,440
Uh, sound travels very well in the old ryokan.

5475
03:33:56,600 --> 03:33:58,700
So my equipment- Uh-huh.

5476
03:33:59,400 --> 03:33:59,820
Sorry.

5477
03:34:00,300 --> 03:34:00,900
Sorry.

5478
03:34:01,180 --> 03:34:02,160
Uh-huh.

5479
03:34:02,950 --> 03:34:06,440
My equipment picked up more conversations than usual, but nothing supernatural.

5480
03:34:07,420 --> 03:34:10,180
At 2am, however, that all changed.

5481
03:34:10,420 --> 03:34:13,180
The lights in my room suddenly flickered and cut off!

5482
03:34:13,960 --> 03:34:16,140
EVP catching that ghostly ASMR.

5483
03:34:18,240 --> 03:34:20,360
I rushed downstairs to my recorders.

5484
03:34:20,480 --> 03:34:21,280
I couldn't hear a thing.

5485
03:34:21,400 --> 03:34:23,080
But the readings were off the charts.

5486
03:34:24,260 --> 03:34:26,340
Before I could listen to the audio, I saw her.

5487
03:34:26,680 --> 03:34:27,620
Pale and thin.

5488
03:34:27,860 --> 03:34:29,280
With long black hair.

5489
03:34:29,700 --> 03:34:31,140
Dripping muddy water.

5490
03:34:31,560 --> 03:34:32,660
Moving through the shadows.

5491
03:34:33,080 --> 03:34:34,140
Despite my experience...

5492
03:34:35,560 --> 03:34:37,600
I froze as she slipped out of sight.

5493
03:34:37,840 --> 03:34:40,600
I stood there in the lobby until the sun finally came up.

5494
03:34:40,780 --> 03:34:42,380
Half hoping she would reappear.

5495
03:34:42,380 --> 03:34:46,160
The other half desperately hoping to never see her again.

5496
03:34:47,960 --> 03:34:49,620
Takai woke me up that afternoon.

5497
03:34:49,900 --> 03:34:50,820
We had to leave.

5498
03:34:51,180 --> 03:34:54,940
Kasumi said- Oh, Kasumi, she said, had changed her mind.

5499
03:34:55,300 --> 03:34:59,020
Whatever faith Takai had in me the day before was now gone.

5500
03:34:59,280 --> 03:35:01,960
I doubt I was the only one to see the ghost the night before.

5501
03:35:02,400 --> 03:35:06,460
I gave her my card and told her to call me if she ever changes her mind.

5502
03:35:06,620 --> 03:35:09,380
I doubt she will and I have to admit I'm a little relieved.

5503
03:35:09,380 --> 03:35:12,920
This is... this is all that she wrote about this place?

5504
03:35:14,400 --> 03:35:17,880
On the bus to the temple the next morning I reviewed the EVP tapes.

5505
03:35:18,080 --> 03:35:22,420
What I heard sounded like a hundred voices repeating a single word in Japanese.

5506
03:35:22,960 --> 03:35:25,720
I pulled out my transliterated...

5507
03:35:26,350 --> 03:35:26,960
Phrase book.

5508
03:35:27,300 --> 03:35:28,160
Your dictionary?

5509
03:35:28,740 --> 03:35:29,060
Hahaha.

5510
03:35:30,120 --> 03:35:31,760
The word simply meant...

5511
03:35:31,760 --> 03:35:32,280
Leave.

5512
03:35:33,440 --> 03:35:36,480
That's the kind of message you only want to hear once you're gone.

5513
03:35:38,020 --> 03:35:40,560
I still sometimes worry about the Shimizu family.

5514
03:35:40,840 --> 03:35:42,180
I can't help but wonder...

5515
03:35:42,180 --> 03:35:45,520
What it must be like for them during those long nights...

5516
03:35:45,520 --> 03:35:48,020
When the woman I saw in the shadows is awake.

5517
03:35:53,940 --> 03:35:56,320
She pulled out the Duolingo for that.

5518
03:35:59,300 --> 03:36:02,340
The ghosts of Centralia, PA.

5519
03:36:05,600 --> 03:36:06,440
Ghost towns.

5520
03:36:06,680 --> 03:36:07,940
Oh, cool.

5521
03:36:08,200 --> 03:36:09,140
Okay, so we read that.

5522
03:36:11,480 --> 03:36:11,940
Hello.

5523
03:36:11,940 --> 03:36:12,960
I'll let you go.

5524
03:36:13,180 --> 03:36:13,500
Bye.

5525
03:36:13,600 --> 03:36:14,160
I'll let you go.

5526
03:36:14,340 --> 03:36:14,640
Bye.

5527
03:36:15,280 --> 03:36:16,540
Okay, we still got time.

5528
03:36:16,680 --> 03:36:17,500
We can go talk to Grandma.

5529
03:36:17,500 --> 03:36:23,380
Probably be like... Did you notice... Did you notice Miwako while I was changing the camera angle?

5530
03:36:25,740 --> 03:36:28,840
We probably can talk to her about the book.

5531
03:36:28,980 --> 03:36:30,180
Hello, Nancy-san.

5532
03:36:30,300 --> 03:36:30,540
Really?

5533
03:36:30,700 --> 03:36:30,800
Nothing?

5534
03:36:30,980 --> 03:36:31,760
I'll talk to you later.

5535
03:36:32,120 --> 03:36:32,460
Goodbye.

5536
03:36:33,280 --> 03:36:34,160
Talk to Rentaro.

5537
03:36:34,340 --> 03:36:37,020
Yeah, we'll go talk to... Go talk to everybody, I guess.

5538
03:36:38,700 --> 03:36:40,980
Oh, I didn't... I was like, why can't I leave?

5539
03:36:43,720 --> 03:36:44,200
Hey.

5540
03:36:44,960 --> 03:36:45,440
Oh.

5541
03:36:47,500 --> 03:36:49,640
Have you ever heard of EVP?

5542
03:36:50,460 --> 03:36:51,900
Electronic voice phenomenon?

5543
03:36:52,680 --> 03:36:53,440
That whole...

5544
03:36:53,440 --> 03:36:59,700
If you go to haunted places and record the ambient noise, when you turn it way up, you'll hear things that are too quiet for the human ear.

5545
03:37:01,060 --> 03:37:03,220
Ghosts, specters, all sorts of baddies.

5546
03:37:03,580 --> 03:37:04,020
Baddies?

5547
03:37:04,460 --> 03:37:05,560
I'm a baddie.

5548
03:37:07,320 --> 03:37:07,760
Rentaro.

5549
03:37:09,520 --> 03:37:11,140
Savannah mentioned it in her book.

5550
03:37:11,340 --> 03:37:13,500
I wonder if you know how I could try it out.

5551
03:37:13,500 --> 03:37:14,160
Oh?

5552
03:37:14,400 --> 03:37:14,420
Oh, sure.

5553
03:37:14,660 --> 03:37:15,840
I got something that can do that.

5554
03:37:15,960 --> 03:37:16,080
Oh?

5555
03:37:16,460 --> 03:37:18,660
I've got a bunch of little recorders, actually.

5556
03:37:19,240 --> 03:37:23,780
I'm trying to find the right one to record new sounds for the Rentaro 4000.

5557
03:37:24,080 --> 03:37:24,380
Oh!

5558
03:37:24,640 --> 03:37:25,160
Here you go.

5559
03:37:25,760 --> 03:37:26,180
Thank you.

5560
03:37:28,020 --> 03:37:28,440
Thanks.

5561
03:37:29,040 --> 03:37:32,100
All you have to do is hook it up to the speakers over there.

5562
03:37:32,280 --> 03:37:32,480
Okay.

5563
03:37:32,480 --> 03:37:34,960
I have a program that edits out dead audio.

5564
03:37:35,420 --> 03:37:36,040
Get it?

5565
03:37:36,360 --> 03:37:39,500
It'll cut right to the parts that actually have recorded sound.

5566
03:37:39,580 --> 03:37:39,960
Oh, okay.

5567
03:37:40,200 --> 03:37:43,340
Oh, and once I've got it fixed, you have to check out the new recorder.

5568
03:37:43,540 --> 03:37:45,120
I saw the reverse tension near the little.

5569
03:37:45,520 --> 03:37:45,920
Okay.

5570
03:37:46,280 --> 03:37:46,920
What's it do?

5571
03:37:47,060 --> 03:37:47,720
This guy's such a nerd.

5572
03:37:48,020 --> 03:37:48,120
It's awesome.

5573
03:37:48,280 --> 03:37:49,760
High data wireless transfer.

5574
03:37:50,200 --> 03:37:51,780
Here's something you like, just push a button.

5575
03:37:51,920 --> 03:37:53,060
It zips it to your computer.

5576
03:37:53,240 --> 03:38:00,080
If you want to send everyone a message, you just speak into it, push send all, and it shoots what you've recorded to everyone's voicemail inbox.

5577
03:38:00,080 --> 03:38:01,420
Very, very cool.

5578
03:38:01,760 --> 03:38:03,680
I just got to keep fussing with it.

5579
03:38:03,760 --> 03:38:06,200
That sounds really horrible and annoying.

5580
03:38:08,080 --> 03:38:10,460
The wireless transfer sounds nice.

5581
03:38:10,720 --> 03:38:13,120
I think sending it to everybody sounds really terrible.

5582
03:38:13,760 --> 03:38:14,760
Very, very cool.

5583
03:38:15,280 --> 03:38:16,500
Very, very cool.

5584
03:38:17,180 --> 03:38:18,920
Have you read Savannah's book?

5585
03:38:19,400 --> 03:38:19,640
Yeah.

5586
03:38:20,060 --> 03:38:21,440
She spelled my name wrong.

5587
03:38:21,660 --> 03:38:23,280
She's not a good speller.

5588
03:38:24,100 --> 03:38:28,860
Maybe she's being haunted by the ghost of a sparing.

5589
03:38:30,080 --> 03:38:32,180
Do you think there's anything to what it says?

5590
03:38:33,120 --> 03:38:34,280
I remember when she was here.

5591
03:38:34,600 --> 03:38:35,760
She was very...

5592
03:38:35,760 --> 03:38:37,760
She has this way of looking at you.

5593
03:38:38,160 --> 03:38:41,080
It's like she knows if you're telling her the truth or not.

5594
03:38:41,680 --> 03:38:45,860
I'm glad she's back into regular journalism instead of this ghost nonsense.

5595
03:38:46,520 --> 03:38:48,960
It really seemed to take its toll on her.

5596
03:38:49,020 --> 03:38:50,840
I thought it was just a typo.

5597
03:38:51,420 --> 03:38:52,620
Like the game mid.

5598
03:38:52,620 --> 03:38:56,140
Not that I'm saying she can communicate with ghosts.

5599
03:38:56,300 --> 03:38:56,940
That's so funny.

5600
03:38:56,940 --> 03:38:58,860
But she really believes in all of that.

5601
03:38:59,620 --> 03:39:06,300
And watching her, the way she'd walk around here in these half-terrified days, it made you worry about her.

5602
03:39:06,820 --> 03:39:09,300
If you don't believe in ghosts, why did you worry?

5603
03:39:10,000 --> 03:39:14,140
Because believing in something, that makes it real to you.

5604
03:39:14,440 --> 03:39:17,580
To her, that whole other world is real.

5605
03:39:17,580 --> 03:39:20,580
And that is still a very dangerous thing.

5606
03:39:20,920 --> 03:39:23,560
A ghost doesn't need to be real to haunt you.

5607
03:39:25,100 --> 03:39:25,580
Wow.

5608
03:39:27,120 --> 03:39:28,320
That feels so deep.

5609
03:39:28,580 --> 03:39:30,240
Just joining in as Idaokojima.

5610
03:39:31,420 --> 03:39:31,900
Maybe.

5611
03:39:34,580 --> 03:39:36,600
Yumi said that you want to move to the city.

5612
03:39:36,840 --> 03:39:37,460
That's so deep.

5613
03:39:37,760 --> 03:39:37,980
Well, yeah.

5614
03:39:38,440 --> 03:39:41,500
I mean, given the choice, everyone wants to live in the city.

5615
03:39:41,640 --> 03:39:42,280
I don't think so.

5616
03:39:42,320 --> 03:39:43,520
The country is fine.

5617
03:39:43,800 --> 03:39:44,860
The mountains are great.

5618
03:39:44,860 --> 03:39:48,260
But you look at one, and you pretty much got it figured out.

5619
03:39:48,460 --> 03:39:49,160
It's big.

5620
03:39:49,360 --> 03:39:50,120
It's rocky.

5621
03:39:50,540 --> 03:39:51,460
It's a mountain.

5622
03:39:51,680 --> 03:39:52,200
Case closed.

5623
03:39:52,500 --> 03:39:52,700
What?

5624
03:39:52,860 --> 03:39:56,220
But the city is interesting and quirky.

5625
03:39:56,480 --> 03:39:58,480
The writers are pretty good at writing weird guys.

5626
03:39:58,640 --> 03:39:58,820
Yeah.

5627
03:40:00,220 --> 03:40:01,720
What do you want to do in Kyoto?

5628
03:40:02,320 --> 03:40:03,960
I think it's the opposite, though.

5629
03:40:04,100 --> 03:40:05,780
I wanted to work in the tech sector.

5630
03:40:06,000 --> 03:40:08,060
Once you see a city, you pretty much know all cities.

5631
03:40:08,140 --> 03:40:09,120
Everything's moving so fast.

5632
03:40:09,340 --> 03:40:12,300
And in 10 years, I can't even imagine.

5633
03:40:12,740 --> 03:40:15,280
And you've got to be there to be a part of it.

5634
03:40:16,080 --> 03:40:18,340
Why doesn't Miwaka want to move into the city?

5635
03:40:18,960 --> 03:40:20,620
Your guess is as good as mine.

5636
03:40:20,900 --> 03:40:23,260
I've been trying to figure that one out for a long time.

5637
03:40:23,540 --> 03:40:23,560
Hey!

5638
03:40:24,720 --> 03:40:29,060
Considering everything that's happened here, why would anyone want to stay?

5639
03:40:30,040 --> 03:40:30,980
What do you mean?

5640
03:40:33,200 --> 03:40:33,640
Oh.

5641
03:40:33,820 --> 03:40:34,140
Oh.

5642
03:40:34,260 --> 03:40:34,600
Oh.

5643
03:40:34,700 --> 03:40:36,020
He just shrugs.

5644
03:40:36,180 --> 03:40:36,380
Okay.

5645
03:40:37,240 --> 03:40:38,180
I'll let you get back to work.

5646
03:40:38,220 --> 03:40:39,020
I'll let you get back to work.

5647
03:40:39,300 --> 03:40:40,120
See you later.

5648
03:40:41,320 --> 03:40:41,760
Okay.

5649
03:40:42,760 --> 03:40:46,980
Now we have our recorder.

5650
03:40:55,150 --> 03:40:58,830
So I think we got to go to the places that are written here, no?

5651
03:40:59,810 --> 03:41:01,210
So, let's see.

5652
03:41:03,770 --> 03:41:06,830
I placed it in the fire pit in the lobby.

5653
03:41:07,030 --> 03:41:07,750
Let's go to that first.

5654
03:41:11,050 --> 03:41:11,570
Okay.

5655
03:41:13,790 --> 03:41:15,150
Fire pit by the lobby.

5656
03:41:15,930 --> 03:41:16,970
Turn around, please.

5657
03:41:17,790 --> 03:41:18,190
Please.

5658
03:41:19,110 --> 03:41:19,910
Okay, here we go.

5659
03:41:20,670 --> 03:41:21,050
Okay.

5660
03:41:22,290 --> 03:41:23,510
Oh, at 2 a.m.

5661
03:41:24,370 --> 03:41:24,930
You're right.

5662
03:41:25,850 --> 03:41:26,970
Let's go to sleep.

5663
03:41:27,210 --> 03:41:28,890
Oh no, that's going to be so scary!

5664
03:41:32,210 --> 03:41:33,710
That's going to be so scary, no?

5665
03:41:36,150 --> 03:41:36,910
Okay.

5666
03:41:39,530 --> 03:41:40,890
Yeehaw, jump scare.

5667
03:41:42,730 --> 03:41:44,370
I know it gets me too.

5668
03:41:45,170 --> 03:41:45,930
Alright, 2.

5669
03:41:46,370 --> 03:41:48,110
Oh boy, 2 a.m.

5670
03:41:49,350 --> 03:41:50,510
Oh god.

5671
03:41:52,110 --> 03:41:54,490
My alarm is so...

5672
03:41:54,490 --> 03:42:03,650
My alarm is so...

5673
03:42:06,270 --> 03:42:07,470
Upstairs hallways.

5674
03:42:10,090 --> 03:42:11,970
I guess we could do it right here.

5675
03:42:17,630 --> 03:42:18,950
Can't record there.

5676
03:42:19,130 --> 03:42:19,730
It's full.

5677
03:42:19,890 --> 03:42:20,090
Delete.

5678
03:42:26,720 --> 03:42:27,820
When do I stop?

5679
03:42:32,700 --> 03:42:33,420
Okay.

5680
03:42:33,920 --> 03:42:34,500
That's one.

5681
03:42:35,820 --> 03:42:37,080
What did we get?

5682
03:42:39,260 --> 03:42:39,980
Scary.

5683
03:42:40,700 --> 03:42:41,640
Oh god.

5684
03:42:41,980 --> 03:42:42,680
I'm scared.

5685
03:42:50,460 --> 03:42:52,040
She mentioned both baths.

5686
03:42:52,060 --> 03:42:52,920
Are there two baths?

5687
03:42:53,120 --> 03:42:54,800
There's actually... No, that's a good point.

5688
03:42:54,900 --> 03:42:55,620
There's only one.

5689
03:42:56,460 --> 03:42:58,580
She's, uh... misinformed?

5690
03:43:00,840 --> 03:43:04,660
The music stopping scares me even more, I think, than when it's around.

5691
03:43:05,840 --> 03:43:06,860
Oh, gosh.

5692
03:43:07,180 --> 03:43:08,340
Why does it do this every time?

5693
03:43:11,780 --> 03:43:13,500
God, that beep is so loud.

5694
03:43:17,840 --> 03:43:19,540
Recording, recording, recording.

5695
03:43:22,700 --> 03:43:24,480
Or they're hiding a bath somewhere.

5696
03:43:24,720 --> 03:43:28,120
Do you think the bath where she died in is being hidden?

5697
03:43:30,120 --> 03:43:30,600
Maybe.

5698
03:43:32,640 --> 03:43:34,640
Maybe they did used to have two baths.

5699
03:43:34,720 --> 03:43:35,960
One for women, one for men.

5700
03:43:39,240 --> 03:43:42,180
And they sealed off the one where she died.

5701
03:43:44,400 --> 03:43:44,880
Freaky!

5702
03:43:47,320 --> 03:43:48,480
Okay, um...

5703
03:43:48,480 --> 03:43:50,560
Behind the old cherry tree.

5704
03:43:50,900 --> 03:43:52,320
So, cherry... Okay, we got the fire pit.

5705
03:43:52,600 --> 03:43:53,680
Both baths.

5706
03:43:54,500 --> 03:43:55,660
Upstairs hallways.

5707
03:44:01,160 --> 03:44:02,020
Cherry tree.

5708
03:44:03,340 --> 03:44:04,740
Was I not just here?

5709
03:44:05,020 --> 03:44:05,900
Trying this out?

5710
03:44:06,480 --> 03:44:07,500
And it didn't work?

5711
03:44:08,560 --> 03:44:09,340
Oh, see?

5712
03:44:09,500 --> 03:44:10,080
Yeah, it didn't work.

5713
03:44:11,280 --> 03:44:13,200
Oh, see?

5714
03:44:13,200 --> 03:44:13,200
Yeah, it didn't work.

5715
03:44:13,200 --> 03:44:13,480
Delete.

5716
03:44:16,120 --> 03:44:17,540
Is this close enough?

5717
03:44:17,760 --> 03:44:18,760
To the cherry tree?

5718
03:44:21,020 --> 03:44:21,580
No?

5719
03:44:23,480 --> 03:44:24,040
Okay.

5720
03:44:24,500 --> 03:44:25,720
Oh my god, it's so loud.

5721
03:44:29,760 --> 03:44:30,820
The peepo?

5722
03:44:31,260 --> 03:44:31,980
Behind it.

5723
03:44:32,040 --> 03:44:33,580
There's no way I can get behind it.

5724
03:44:36,380 --> 03:44:37,340
There's no way.

5725
03:44:43,430 --> 03:44:45,630
I'm gonna turn the sound down since it's so loud.

5726
03:44:45,990 --> 03:44:46,370
Tuhuhuh.

5727
03:44:49,290 --> 03:44:49,590
Ah.

5728
03:44:52,150 --> 03:44:53,290
It doesn't work.

5729
03:44:53,990 --> 03:44:55,030
One of the peepo.

5730
03:44:55,190 --> 03:44:56,190
Let's go to the peepo.

5731
03:44:58,230 --> 03:44:59,270
To the peepo!

5732
03:44:59,510 --> 03:45:00,230
To the peepo!

5733
03:45:00,630 --> 03:45:02,130
Do I have to open it back up?

5734
03:45:06,220 --> 03:45:07,160
To the peepo.

5735
03:45:07,160 --> 03:45:07,520
You think?

5736
03:45:11,000 --> 03:45:11,470
Oh!

5737
03:45:11,790 --> 03:45:11,930
Oh!

5738
03:45:12,130 --> 03:45:12,690
It's working!

5739
03:45:20,940 --> 03:45:22,230
I wonder what it's saying.

5740
03:45:24,840 --> 03:45:25,790
Probably like...

5741
03:45:25,790 --> 03:45:25,930
Kyuh!

5742
03:45:26,390 --> 03:45:26,870
Etsy!

5743
03:45:30,040 --> 03:45:31,130
Get out of here!

5744
03:45:33,540 --> 03:45:34,010
Calm.

5745
03:45:40,270 --> 03:45:41,210
Hentai.

5746
03:45:43,470 --> 03:45:45,790
Let's go to the other hallway, I suppose.

5747
03:45:47,610 --> 03:45:49,630
Because it said upstairs hallways.

5748
03:45:51,010 --> 03:45:52,290
So we can go here.

5749
03:45:53,810 --> 03:45:54,430
Nope.

5750
03:45:54,610 --> 03:45:54,890
Just kidding.

5751
03:45:55,850 --> 03:45:56,750
Just kidding.

5752
03:45:57,530 --> 03:45:58,150
Here.

5753
03:45:59,430 --> 03:46:00,870
We gotta go deep in.

5754
03:46:03,730 --> 03:46:04,350
Unless...

5755
03:46:05,130 --> 03:46:06,570
Unless the first one counted.

5756
03:46:10,200 --> 03:46:11,120
Oh, sorry.

5757
03:46:12,580 --> 03:46:12,700
Haha.

5758
03:46:16,300 --> 03:46:17,120
Fire pit.

5759
03:46:17,540 --> 03:46:19,240
Behind the old cherry tree.

5760
03:46:19,700 --> 03:46:21,300
By both baths.

5761
03:46:21,400 --> 03:46:23,140
And in the upstairs hallways.

5762
03:46:28,100 --> 03:46:29,420
Maybe like closer down.

5763
03:46:32,320 --> 03:46:32,900
No?

5764
03:46:33,860 --> 03:46:35,300
Did you do one at the footprints?

5765
03:46:35,580 --> 03:46:35,840
No.

5766
03:46:36,140 --> 03:46:36,520
But it's...

5767
03:46:36,520 --> 03:46:37,400
That's not in the book.

5768
03:46:38,780 --> 03:46:40,500
I guess we can try in my room.

5769
03:46:40,580 --> 03:46:41,420
Oh, that's too scary.

5770
03:46:41,960 --> 03:46:43,540
Doing one in your own room?

5771
03:46:44,500 --> 03:46:45,380
Hell no.

5772
03:46:45,840 --> 03:46:46,200
Hahaha.

5773
03:46:46,200 --> 03:46:46,300
Hahaha.

5774
03:46:48,280 --> 03:46:49,140
Hell no.

5775
03:47:00,000 --> 03:47:00,600
Uh...

5776
03:47:04,130 --> 03:47:04,730
Nope.

5777
03:47:06,610 --> 03:47:08,870
I can't tell if I've done it all or not.

5778
03:47:17,860 --> 03:47:18,460
Maybe...

5779
03:47:19,360 --> 03:47:22,280
I don't think this counts as behind the cherry blossom tree, but...

5780
03:47:23,160 --> 03:47:23,760
Nope.

5781
03:47:24,600 --> 03:47:27,000
Can you bless me a minute for my exam today?

5782
03:47:28,000 --> 03:47:28,440
What?

5783
03:47:28,440 --> 03:47:30,120
Heламaru, you got this!

5784
03:47:31,300 --> 03:47:32,400
You got this!

5785
03:47:32,400 --> 03:47:32,940
What is this?

5786
03:47:33,880 --> 03:47:35,880
Minto Energy Beam!

5787
03:47:48,000 --> 03:47:48,900
I don't know.

5788
03:47:58,740 --> 03:48:00,080
I don't know.

5789
03:48:02,340 --> 03:48:07,500
I feel like I'm doing it correctly, but it's not... I don't know.

5790
03:48:14,820 --> 03:48:16,340
Is it because it's not 2am?

5791
03:48:16,440 --> 03:48:18,220
Oh, maybe because it's 3am now.

5792
03:48:18,680 --> 03:48:19,620
No way.

5793
03:48:21,040 --> 03:48:22,480
They wouldn't make it that...

5794
03:48:23,060 --> 03:48:24,760
that, like, strict, would they?

5795
03:48:31,750 --> 03:48:32,730
No way.

5796
03:48:33,170 --> 03:48:33,710
Hold on.

5797
03:48:34,550 --> 03:48:37,210
I'm gonna find... I'm gonna read the walkthrough for this part.

5798
03:48:49,360 --> 03:48:50,400
Oh, EVP.

5799
03:48:53,980 --> 03:48:54,420
Ah!

5800
03:48:58,040 --> 03:48:59,540
That's how you go behind.

5801
03:49:00,380 --> 03:49:01,580
Let's see if it works now.

5802
03:49:02,500 --> 03:49:02,860
Ah!

5803
03:49:05,700 --> 03:49:06,140
Okay.

5804
03:49:12,420 --> 03:49:12,860
Wow.

5805
03:49:13,300 --> 03:49:16,400
The ghost had so much to say.

5806
03:49:17,020 --> 03:49:18,200
Okay, okay, hold on.

5807
03:49:19,640 --> 03:49:20,520
Um, let's see.

5808
03:49:20,580 --> 03:49:23,000
Go to the places mentioned in Savannah's book and record the sounds.

5809
03:49:23,000 --> 03:49:25,580
The places are behind the cherry tree, this fireplace.

5810
03:49:26,360 --> 03:49:27,460
Mirror in the bath.

5811
03:49:28,560 --> 03:49:30,480
The sha- by the showers.

5812
03:49:32,900 --> 03:49:36,180
And both upstairs corridors sort of halfway down.

5813
03:49:40,280 --> 03:49:41,420
But I...

5814
03:49:41,420 --> 03:49:43,880
I only got the one upstairs, no?

5815
03:49:47,830 --> 03:49:49,370
I didn't get the other upstairs.

5816
03:49:52,270 --> 03:49:54,410
I think we got outside the...

5817
03:49:54,410 --> 03:49:55,730
the door...

5818
03:49:55,730 --> 03:49:57,050
of the bath.

5819
03:49:57,230 --> 03:49:58,110
So maybe that's okay.

5820
03:49:59,090 --> 03:50:01,750
Unless it counted as, like, both hallways, you know?

5821
03:50:02,190 --> 03:50:02,930
Yeah, see?

5822
03:50:05,070 --> 03:50:05,630
Oh!

5823
03:50:05,630 --> 03:50:07,070
I should check that out.

5824
03:50:07,510 --> 03:50:07,910
Oh!

5825
03:50:08,010 --> 03:50:08,230
Okay.

5826
03:50:08,230 --> 03:50:10,570
I should go back and play this at Rentaro's place.

5827
03:50:15,330 --> 03:50:15,730
Oh!

5828
03:50:15,870 --> 03:50:16,070
Okay.

5829
03:50:16,410 --> 03:50:17,350
Uh, I guess we're good then.

5830
03:50:18,190 --> 03:50:18,590
Cool.

5831
03:50:19,530 --> 03:50:22,290
We're gonna play it on the spe- We're gonna play it on the speaker?

5832
03:50:22,610 --> 03:50:23,990
Oh my god, that's so scary.

5833
03:50:24,310 --> 03:50:26,070
I love how this is Rentaro's place.

5834
03:50:26,230 --> 03:50:27,210
It's literally a shack.

5835
03:50:28,790 --> 03:50:29,390
Like...

5836
03:50:30,130 --> 03:50:31,390
There's a speaker here.

5837
03:50:31,590 --> 03:50:32,890
Oh god, I'm scared.

5838
03:50:36,330 --> 03:50:36,930
Play.

5839
03:50:37,290 --> 03:50:37,530
Oh.

5840
03:50:38,390 --> 03:50:39,590
Oh god, it's so loud.

5841
03:50:49,870 --> 03:50:51,350
That was just static.

5842
03:50:52,650 --> 03:50:53,130
Hold on.

5843
03:50:54,990 --> 03:50:56,370
Every time I...

5844
03:50:56,370 --> 03:50:57,710
press the thing, I...

5845
03:50:57,710 --> 03:50:58,390
lower the volume.

5846
03:51:01,210 --> 03:51:02,470
Also just static?

5847
03:51:02,470 --> 03:51:02,550
Okay.

5848
03:51:08,060 --> 03:51:08,500
That's...

5849
03:51:08,500 --> 03:51:09,800
someone playing football.

5850
03:51:13,720 --> 03:51:14,600
And then...

5851
03:51:15,160 --> 03:51:16,540
You can't just do that.

5852
03:51:16,720 --> 03:51:19,780
We're not all here to make sure that you get what you want, Yumi.

5853
03:51:20,280 --> 03:51:20,500
No.

5854
03:51:20,800 --> 03:51:21,480
Don't stop.

5855
03:51:21,760 --> 03:51:23,180
Please continue with your speech.

5856
03:51:23,260 --> 03:51:23,420
Uh oh.

5857
03:51:23,620 --> 03:51:26,140
I love jumping on the train to get picked on by you two.

5858
03:51:26,300 --> 03:51:26,560
The drama?

5859
03:51:26,900 --> 03:51:28,500
Couldn't think of a better way to spend my day.

5860
03:51:28,700 --> 03:51:32,880
Can't wait for the mean phone messages about what an awful sister I am because I never visit.

5861
03:51:33,080 --> 03:51:34,960
You've got to be selfish about this too.

5862
03:51:35,800 --> 03:51:37,360
Everything's always about you.

5863
03:51:37,620 --> 03:51:41,240
She asked one thing from you and you act like it's the end of the world.

5864
03:51:41,600 --> 03:51:43,000
Oh, shut up, Miwako.

5865
03:51:43,260 --> 03:51:46,740
When you're both ganging up on me, then it actually is about me.

5866
03:51:47,120 --> 03:51:48,320
Thanks to Brat.

5867
03:51:48,540 --> 03:51:48,960
Brat?

5868
03:51:49,160 --> 03:51:50,540
You wanna see Brat?

5869
03:51:50,700 --> 03:51:52,000
I'll show you Brat.

5870
03:51:52,120 --> 03:51:53,620
It looks a lot like this.

5871
03:51:54,960 --> 03:51:57,380
I can't believe you just did that.

5872
03:51:57,740 --> 03:51:58,380
Believe it.

5873
03:51:58,700 --> 03:51:59,400
I'm out.

5874
03:51:59,400 --> 03:51:59,480
I'm out.

5875
03:51:59,760 --> 03:52:01,940
It sounds like she threw something in the pond.

5876
03:52:02,320 --> 03:52:03,780
I should check that out.

5877
03:52:05,760 --> 03:52:06,320
Okay.

5878
03:52:08,060 --> 03:52:09,620
That's what it sounded like?

5879
03:52:12,320 --> 03:52:13,440
In the pond.

5880
03:52:15,600 --> 03:52:16,620
Like over here?

5881
03:52:20,000 --> 03:52:21,700
Oh, I can go up to here.

5882
03:52:22,220 --> 03:52:22,740
Oh!

5883
03:52:22,960 --> 03:52:23,880
I can go up to this.

5884
03:52:24,820 --> 03:52:25,480
Uh, wait.

5885
03:52:25,840 --> 03:52:27,280
Can I check in the pond?

5886
03:52:27,700 --> 03:52:28,700
I'm in the pond.

5887
03:52:29,260 --> 03:52:30,400
Don't call it a shack.

5888
03:52:30,660 --> 03:52:31,840
That's Rintarno's doghouse.

5889
03:52:34,440 --> 03:52:36,640
Uh, maybe on the bridge?

5890
03:52:38,660 --> 03:52:40,640
How do we record this?

5891
03:52:41,120 --> 03:52:41,780
When did they...

5892
03:52:41,780 --> 03:52:42,600
When did she...

5893
03:52:42,600 --> 03:52:43,580
Wait.

5894
03:52:43,740 --> 03:52:45,040
So I was behind the tree.

5895
03:52:45,280 --> 03:52:47,720
And they were arguing in front of the tree.

5896
03:52:48,960 --> 03:52:49,620
And...

5897
03:52:50,320 --> 03:52:52,380
Then she threw it in just...

5898
03:52:52,380 --> 03:52:52,600
Now?

5899
03:52:53,200 --> 03:52:55,040
I'm so confused.

5900
03:52:57,580 --> 03:52:58,240
Huh?

5901
03:53:01,450 --> 03:53:03,000
The logic here...

5902
03:53:03,640 --> 03:53:05,680
Is escaping me a little bit.

5903
03:53:06,840 --> 03:53:07,400
Huh?

5904
03:53:08,300 --> 03:53:09,640
How am I supposed to...

5905
03:53:12,580 --> 03:53:13,680
I don't...

5906
03:53:13,680 --> 03:53:14,060
Huh?

5907
03:53:16,960 --> 03:53:18,100
What am I doing wrong?

5908
03:53:20,280 --> 03:53:21,740
What am I doing wrong here?

5909
03:53:23,460 --> 03:53:24,660
Try the other side.

5910
03:53:30,290 --> 03:53:30,850
Uh...

5911
03:53:30,850 --> 03:53:34,050
I don't think I can get close.

5912
03:53:34,610 --> 03:53:35,390
Oh, wait!

5913
03:53:35,630 --> 03:53:36,510
Oh, that's a deer scare.

5914
03:53:36,510 --> 03:53:36,590
There.

5915
03:53:41,130 --> 03:53:42,510
Do you guys feel relaxed?

5916
03:53:48,580 --> 03:53:50,320
That's such a nice detail, actually.

5917
03:53:55,660 --> 03:53:57,440
It's actually kind of such a nice detail.

5918
03:54:00,420 --> 03:54:00,880
Um...

5919
03:54:05,400 --> 03:54:06,280
Oh, wait here?

5920
03:54:08,380 --> 03:54:09,420
Uh, can I turn?

5921
03:54:10,820 --> 03:54:11,540
Uh...

5922
03:54:11,540 --> 03:54:11,700
No.

5923
03:54:14,180 --> 03:54:15,140
Please, let me search.

5924
03:54:15,480 --> 03:54:17,060
Please, let me search the pond!

5925
03:54:19,140 --> 03:54:19,500
Please!

5926
03:54:20,360 --> 03:54:21,080
What?

5927
03:54:25,460 --> 03:54:25,820
Oh!

5928
03:54:26,040 --> 03:54:26,240
Wait!

5929
03:54:26,860 --> 03:54:27,340
Oh!

5930
03:54:27,600 --> 03:54:27,740
Ah!

5931
03:54:30,840 --> 03:54:31,560
Eighteen.

5932
03:54:31,560 --> 03:54:32,820
What's that?

5933
03:54:33,140 --> 03:54:35,280
Looks like there are some rocks missing.

5934
03:54:35,680 --> 03:54:38,060
I wonder if I could find them around the garden.

5935
03:54:39,100 --> 03:54:40,700
What the hell is this?

5936
03:54:40,880 --> 03:54:41,780
Wait, what is this?

5937
03:54:45,300 --> 03:54:46,440
What is this?

5938
03:54:48,420 --> 03:54:50,340
This doesn't fit in any of them.

5939
03:54:51,020 --> 03:54:51,500
What?

5940
03:54:53,260 --> 03:54:54,460
Okay, fine.

5941
03:54:55,040 --> 03:54:56,640
We're gonna go find some...

5942
03:54:57,720 --> 03:54:59,240
rocks around the garden.

5943
03:55:00,440 --> 03:55:01,080
Okay.

5944
03:55:02,500 --> 03:55:02,740
Uh...

5945
03:55:04,240 --> 03:55:04,880
No!

5946
03:55:08,040 --> 03:55:08,680
No!

5947
03:55:09,380 --> 03:55:10,140
That's it!

5948
03:55:10,240 --> 03:55:11,120
We were so close!

5949
03:55:11,280 --> 03:55:13,280
Oh my gosh, we barely made that then.

5950
03:55:13,660 --> 03:55:14,640
Holy cow.

5951
03:55:16,880 --> 03:55:18,160
We're barely...

5952
03:55:18,160 --> 03:55:19,560
Barely made that.

5953
03:55:19,680 --> 03:55:20,220
Oh my gosh.

5954
03:55:22,580 --> 03:55:24,540
Is there any homework we gotta grid?

5955
03:55:24,960 --> 03:55:25,060
Oh!

5956
03:55:25,240 --> 03:55:25,980
On the farm!

5957
03:55:26,520 --> 03:55:27,620
On the farm!

5958
03:55:28,580 --> 03:55:29,620
Just ordered my...

5959
03:55:30,140 --> 03:55:31,900
Thank you, Jalen!

5960
03:55:32,980 --> 03:55:34,560
The pig goes quack.

5961
03:55:35,660 --> 03:55:38,400
My family likes to hunt in the hay.

5962
03:55:39,580 --> 03:55:41,260
The sheep eats hay.

5963
03:55:42,380 --> 03:55:42,720
Yeah.

5964
03:55:43,100 --> 03:55:44,220
Do sheep eat hay?

5965
03:55:44,540 --> 03:55:46,980
A lamb is a baby horse.

5966
03:55:47,320 --> 03:55:47,500
No.

5967
03:55:49,980 --> 03:55:50,660
No.

5968
03:55:50,660 --> 03:55:51,820
The duck goes quack.

5969
03:55:52,020 --> 03:55:52,400
Yes.

5970
03:55:52,760 --> 03:55:54,780
My cat likes to hunt in the barn.

5971
03:55:54,960 --> 03:55:55,140
Okay.

5972
03:55:55,980 --> 03:55:57,620
The hay eats horse.

5973
03:55:57,960 --> 03:55:58,540
Oh no!

5974
03:55:59,320 --> 03:56:01,760
A sheep is a baby lamb.

5975
03:56:02,460 --> 03:56:03,140
No.

5976
03:56:07,650 --> 03:56:08,330
Fumiko.

5977
03:56:08,510 --> 03:56:09,690
The duck goes quack.

5978
03:56:09,770 --> 03:56:10,570
Our genius here.

5979
03:56:12,090 --> 03:56:14,230
My cat likes to hunt in the barn.

5980
03:56:14,510 --> 03:56:15,890
The horse eats hay.

5981
03:56:15,890 --> 03:56:15,910
Hay.

5982
03:56:16,210 --> 03:56:18,250
A lamb is a baby sheep.

5983
03:56:18,510 --> 03:56:18,670
A lamb is a baby sheep.

5984
03:56:20,210 --> 03:56:21,730
Genius, genius, Fumiko.

5985
03:56:23,170 --> 03:56:23,810
Quack.

5986
03:56:24,750 --> 03:56:26,690
The cat goes quack.

5987
03:56:27,610 --> 03:56:28,090
No.

5988
03:56:29,130 --> 03:56:31,270
My lamb likes to hunt in the hay.

5989
03:56:32,510 --> 03:56:32,710
No.

5990
03:56:32,710 --> 03:56:32,790
No.

5991
03:56:32,970 --> 03:56:34,950
The duck eats barn.

5992
03:56:41,510 --> 03:56:41,830
Cyndal!

5993
03:56:42,230 --> 03:56:43,330
Happy birthday!

5994
03:56:43,530 --> 03:56:44,230
Thank you so much!

5995
03:56:44,290 --> 03:56:45,070
Happy, happy birthday!

5996
03:56:46,290 --> 03:56:48,670
A sheep is a baby horse.

5997
03:56:49,210 --> 03:56:49,390
No.

5998
03:56:51,230 --> 03:56:53,250
But you get points for making me laugh.

5999
03:56:53,670 --> 03:56:55,310
The duck goes quack.

6000
03:56:58,610 --> 03:57:00,030
Oh my gosh, there's...

6001
03:57:00,030 --> 03:57:00,870
My cat lights...

6002
03:57:00,870 --> 03:57:02,030
Wait, they're so close!

6003
03:57:02,730 --> 03:57:04,250
The horse eats hay.

6004
03:57:04,250 --> 03:57:06,350
A sheep is a baby lamb.

6005
03:57:06,650 --> 03:57:07,330
So close!

6006
03:57:07,830 --> 03:57:08,390
So close.

6007
03:57:08,950 --> 03:57:10,130
So close, Takeo.

6008
03:57:12,690 --> 03:57:13,150
Alright.

6009
03:57:13,450 --> 03:57:14,490
We did all of our grading.

6010
03:57:15,730 --> 03:57:16,950
Um, what did we get?

6011
03:57:17,070 --> 03:57:18,570
Oh, we got the key for 18.

6012
03:57:19,770 --> 03:57:21,250
So let's go...

6013
03:57:23,810 --> 03:57:24,270
Downstairs.

6014
03:57:24,570 --> 03:57:25,290
Would that be in here?

6015
03:57:26,030 --> 03:57:26,930
Oh, this is one.

6016
03:57:27,350 --> 03:57:27,510
Locked.

6017
03:57:27,690 --> 03:57:28,370
No, don't turn around.

6018
03:57:28,730 --> 03:57:29,190
Turn around.

6019
03:57:30,030 --> 03:57:30,950
Turn around.

6020
03:57:32,210 --> 03:57:34,090
I believe it's...

6021
03:57:34,090 --> 03:57:34,690
10.

6022
03:57:39,360 --> 03:57:39,800
19.

6023
03:57:42,540 --> 03:57:44,220
Oh, it's the room!

6024
03:57:44,780 --> 03:57:45,900
Oh my gosh.

6025
03:57:47,200 --> 03:57:48,840
Oh, but she... I didn't need it anyway.

6026
03:57:49,020 --> 03:57:49,980
Hello, Nancy-san.

6027
03:57:50,200 --> 03:57:51,740
Okay, now we can come here and die!

6028
03:57:51,740 --> 03:57:52,580
I should go.

6029
03:57:52,820 --> 03:57:53,940
I'll talk to you later.

6030
03:57:54,120 --> 03:57:54,580
Oh my gosh.

6031
03:57:54,600 --> 03:57:55,700
Goodbye, Nancy-san.

6032
03:57:55,920 --> 03:57:56,420
Oh my gosh.

6033
03:57:56,580 --> 03:57:57,040
Oh my gosh.

6034
03:57:57,260 --> 03:57:58,580
Progress, progress, progress.

6035
03:57:59,200 --> 03:57:59,640
Progress!

6036
03:57:59,640 --> 03:58:00,540
Ah!

6037
03:58:01,060 --> 03:58:01,340
Okay.

6038
03:58:02,300 --> 03:58:05,880
So we got that, and we have to go look for rocks in the...

6039
03:58:07,440 --> 03:58:08,040
Hi.

6040
03:58:08,500 --> 03:58:08,920
Hi.

6041
03:58:09,400 --> 03:58:11,100
Was Yumi here earlier?

6042
03:58:11,520 --> 03:58:11,840
Yes.

6043
03:58:12,580 --> 03:58:13,060
Really?

6044
03:58:13,300 --> 03:58:14,800
I'm sorry I missed her.

6045
03:58:15,060 --> 03:58:15,680
Don't be.

6046
03:58:16,400 --> 03:58:19,340
Anyway, it's always Blink and you'll miss her with Yumi.

6047
03:58:19,920 --> 03:58:22,180
You'd think she was allergic to this place.

6048
03:58:22,480 --> 03:58:23,800
Which is fine by me.

6049
03:58:24,440 --> 03:58:25,240
Why is that?

6050
03:58:25,640 --> 03:58:25,660
Hi.

6051
03:58:25,660 --> 03:58:28,320
Look, I know she's fun at first.

6052
03:58:28,600 --> 03:58:28,680
Hi.

6053
03:58:28,780 --> 03:58:34,160
But it's like strangers get fun Yumi, and all we get is touchy, angry Yumi these days.

6054
03:58:34,580 --> 03:58:34,820
Oh.

6055
03:58:34,820 --> 03:58:36,040
What do you think that is?

6056
03:58:38,120 --> 03:58:41,080
God, maybe you and Red Taro are made for each other.

6057
03:58:41,080 --> 03:58:41,420
I'll talk to you later.

6058
03:58:41,880 --> 03:58:42,440
Okay, see ya.

6059
03:58:42,680 --> 03:58:44,240
Maybe you guys are meant for each other.

6060
03:58:45,120 --> 03:58:46,640
Alright, let's find some rocks.

6061
03:58:48,780 --> 03:58:49,220
Um...

6062
03:58:49,220 --> 03:58:50,700
How do we find some rocks?

6063
03:58:51,460 --> 03:58:51,900
Here?

6064
03:58:52,040 --> 03:58:52,560
There's a rock?

6065
03:58:52,920 --> 03:58:53,980
There's a rock, rock, rock.

6066
03:58:54,120 --> 03:58:55,480
How do I search for the rocks?

6067
03:58:56,160 --> 03:58:57,580
Maybe let's go to the deer scare.

6068
03:58:58,280 --> 03:58:59,380
Any rocks in here?

6069
03:59:01,020 --> 03:59:01,900
Any rocks?

6070
03:59:04,480 --> 03:59:05,160
Oh, sorry.

6071
03:59:05,440 --> 03:59:05,880
Rantarno.

6072
03:59:06,060 --> 03:59:06,340
So true.

6073
03:59:08,260 --> 03:59:08,700
Nothing.

6074
03:59:09,580 --> 03:59:10,020
Nothing.

6075
03:59:10,540 --> 03:59:11,840
That's a rock fact.

6076
03:59:12,140 --> 03:59:12,660
Oh, my bad.

6077
03:59:14,960 --> 03:59:16,140
I'll turn around.

6078
03:59:17,640 --> 03:59:19,380
Maybe he knows where I can find the rocks.

6079
03:59:19,380 --> 03:59:19,560
Hello?

6080
03:59:20,100 --> 03:59:20,360
Nope.

6081
03:59:21,180 --> 03:59:22,060
I'll talk to you later.

6082
03:59:22,280 --> 03:59:22,620
Bye.

6083
03:59:22,820 --> 03:59:24,240
He knows literally nothing.

6084
03:59:25,060 --> 03:59:25,840
Useless to me.

6085
03:59:25,940 --> 03:59:26,340
Useless.

6086
03:59:26,540 --> 03:59:26,880
Useless.

6087
03:59:27,200 --> 03:59:27,700
Wait!

6088
03:59:27,980 --> 03:59:28,220
Wait.

6089
03:59:28,560 --> 03:59:29,760
I found a rock!

6090
03:59:30,100 --> 03:59:31,040
Okay, okay.

6091
03:59:31,340 --> 03:59:31,940
That's one.

6092
03:59:32,300 --> 03:59:33,300
How many do we need?

6093
03:59:37,360 --> 03:59:40,660
How do we know what rocks are the ones that we're trying to find?

6094
03:59:41,100 --> 03:59:41,360
Oh!

6095
03:59:41,600 --> 03:59:41,680
Oh!

6096
03:59:42,780 --> 03:59:43,640
Second rock?

6097
03:59:44,820 --> 03:59:45,440
Okay.

6098
03:59:46,560 --> 03:59:47,600
Okay, okay.

6099
03:59:49,300 --> 03:59:51,160
So far, so good.

6100
03:59:57,440 --> 03:59:59,540
How many do we need?

6101
04:00:00,100 --> 04:00:00,960
Who knows?

6102
04:00:05,420 --> 04:00:06,300
Another rock.

6103
04:00:06,600 --> 04:00:09,360
I'm sure she'll say something like, okay, I have all I need, right?

6104
04:00:09,880 --> 04:00:11,900
Off to a rocky start.

6105
04:00:21,190 --> 04:00:21,790
Hmm.

6106
04:00:25,890 --> 04:00:26,490
Maybe...

6107
04:00:27,370 --> 04:00:28,270
Splash exam.

6108
04:00:28,770 --> 04:00:29,510
Where's the...

6109
04:00:29,510 --> 04:00:30,490
Where's the rock thing that...

6110
04:00:30,490 --> 04:00:31,210
Where's the...

6111
04:00:31,210 --> 04:00:33,270
Where's the thing that we're supposed to be...

6112
04:00:33,270 --> 04:00:34,770
Like, investigating?

6113
04:00:35,170 --> 04:00:35,930
Where's that thing?

6114
04:00:37,310 --> 04:00:38,270
Where is...

6115
04:00:38,270 --> 04:00:40,490
I hope nobody notices that I'm wandering...

6116
04:00:41,110 --> 04:00:41,950
Oh, here we go.

6117
04:00:45,110 --> 04:00:46,050
What...

6118
04:00:46,050 --> 04:00:46,230
What...

6119
04:00:46,230 --> 04:00:46,470
What...

6120
04:00:46,470 --> 04:00:47,370
Do these mean?

6121
04:00:51,670 --> 04:00:52,610
What...

6122
04:00:52,610 --> 04:00:53,570
What?

6123
04:00:53,570 --> 04:00:54,810
What do they mean?

6124
04:00:55,670 --> 04:00:56,030
What?

6125
04:01:04,260 --> 04:01:05,720
The bases.

6126
04:01:06,540 --> 04:01:08,060
It belongs in a museum.

6127
04:01:10,000 --> 04:01:11,660
One, two, three, four.

6128
04:01:12,260 --> 04:01:13,440
One, two, three, four.

6129
04:01:13,700 --> 04:01:13,900
One, two, three, four, five.

6130
04:01:15,740 --> 04:01:16,140
Wait.

6131
04:01:16,340 --> 04:01:17,680
I can't tell how many I need.

6132
04:01:18,280 --> 04:01:18,740
Oh, see?

6133
04:01:18,860 --> 04:01:20,340
Like, there's that one that's really tiny.

6134
04:01:20,580 --> 04:01:21,540
Oh, my gosh.

6135
04:01:21,560 --> 04:01:21,960
Okay.

6136
04:01:22,380 --> 04:01:23,560
Oh, we need a lot.

6137
04:01:24,580 --> 04:01:25,300
I think?

6138
04:01:26,580 --> 04:01:28,240
Because it mirrors the music rising.

6139
04:01:28,400 --> 04:01:29,140
Yeah, it's just...

6140
04:01:29,140 --> 04:01:29,700
It does that.

6141
04:01:29,880 --> 04:01:30,820
It's just the ambiance.

6142
04:01:31,120 --> 04:01:31,840
Don't worry about it.

6143
04:01:36,480 --> 04:01:38,280
There's, like, one more I think we need?

6144
04:01:39,820 --> 04:01:40,220
Maybe?

6145
04:01:47,720 --> 04:01:49,060
Where could it be, though?

6146
04:01:49,940 --> 04:01:50,800
Maybe on this side?

6147
04:01:53,980 --> 04:01:54,520
No?

6148
04:01:56,480 --> 04:01:57,400
Turn around?

6149
04:01:58,140 --> 04:01:59,060
Around here?

6150
04:01:59,860 --> 04:02:00,400
No?

6151
04:02:03,000 --> 04:02:04,200
On this side?

6152
04:02:08,400 --> 04:02:09,260
The lantern?

6153
04:02:09,500 --> 04:02:09,800
Oh, yeah.

6154
04:02:09,920 --> 04:02:11,000
Let's go check the lantern again.

6155
04:02:11,000 --> 04:02:11,560
So true.

6156
04:02:13,680 --> 04:02:14,320
Wait.

6157
04:02:14,960 --> 04:02:15,560
Oh, no.

6158
04:02:15,660 --> 04:02:16,520
That's a reflection.

6159
04:02:21,240 --> 04:02:21,880
Uh...

6160
04:02:25,310 --> 04:02:25,950
No?

6161
04:02:26,270 --> 04:02:28,890
I don't know quite what we can do with this.

6162
04:02:29,790 --> 04:02:30,210
Oh, wait!

6163
04:02:30,570 --> 04:02:30,670
Ah!

6164
04:02:31,770 --> 04:02:32,410
Perfect!

6165
04:02:32,750 --> 04:02:33,110
Alright!

6166
04:02:33,650 --> 04:02:34,590
Good job, guys!

6167
04:02:35,290 --> 04:02:36,390
Good job, team!

6168
04:02:45,270 --> 04:02:46,270
Damn!

6169
04:02:47,150 --> 04:02:47,650
Yeah!

6170
04:02:48,310 --> 04:02:49,370
Oh, my gosh!

6171
04:02:49,890 --> 04:02:50,390
Naruto!

6172
04:02:51,070 --> 04:02:51,950
Sakura!

6173
04:02:52,290 --> 04:02:52,790
The beautiful!

6174
04:02:54,530 --> 04:02:55,690
Oh, gosh.

6175
04:02:56,030 --> 04:02:56,710
Um...

6176
04:02:56,710 --> 04:02:57,410
What do they...

6177
04:02:57,410 --> 04:02:58,790
What do they...

6178
04:03:01,170 --> 04:03:03,070
Is this something I can brute force?

6179
04:03:03,390 --> 04:03:03,870
Or...

6180
04:03:12,150 --> 04:03:12,630
Okay.

6181
04:03:13,470 --> 04:03:14,830
Oh, so this is the...

6182
04:03:15,390 --> 04:03:16,690
This one has a...

6183
04:03:16,690 --> 04:03:17,870
Tiny bottom?

6184
04:03:20,010 --> 04:03:21,090
You can't brute force.

6185
04:03:21,230 --> 04:03:21,910
There's a book in the lobby.

6186
04:03:21,910 --> 04:03:21,970
Okay.

6187
04:03:22,590 --> 04:03:24,450
Counselor Chip, you are our...

6188
04:03:24,450 --> 04:03:25,310
Savior.

6189
04:03:26,270 --> 04:03:27,170
Thank you.

6190
04:03:29,070 --> 04:03:30,310
Which book is it?

6191
04:03:30,410 --> 04:03:30,770
Uh...

6192
04:03:30,770 --> 04:03:31,590
I think there's one over here.

6193
04:03:32,290 --> 04:03:32,910
Yes.

6194
04:03:33,750 --> 04:03:34,230
Ah!

6195
04:03:34,870 --> 04:03:35,230
Okay.

6196
04:03:36,590 --> 04:03:38,170
I think I skipped this earlier.

6197
04:03:38,510 --> 04:03:39,570
Last time, I mean.

6198
04:03:40,790 --> 04:03:41,430
Reishoseki.

6199
04:03:41,930 --> 04:03:42,590
The soul stone.

6200
04:03:42,770 --> 04:03:43,970
Low vertical stone.

6201
04:03:44,370 --> 04:03:46,010
Wide base, tapered top.

6202
04:03:46,530 --> 04:03:47,430
Upright stone.

6203
04:03:49,430 --> 04:03:50,070
Taitoseki.

6204
04:03:51,010 --> 04:03:52,530
Tall vertical stone.

6205
04:03:52,950 --> 04:03:55,550
Only slightly bigger at the base than the top.

6206
04:03:55,770 --> 04:03:57,070
Is the tallest stone...

6207
04:03:57,070 --> 04:03:57,530
Oh, gosh.

6208
04:03:57,970 --> 04:03:59,670
How am I supposed to remember all this?

6209
04:04:06,070 --> 04:04:06,710
Shintaiseki.

6210
04:04:07,710 --> 04:04:10,990
The flat stone is similar in appearance to a stepping stone.

6211
04:04:12,330 --> 04:04:13,350
I'm taking notes?

6212
04:04:13,510 --> 04:04:14,570
Okay, everybody take notes.

6213
04:04:15,790 --> 04:04:17,410
I don't have any pen or paper.

6214
04:04:20,630 --> 04:04:22,350
Have I screenshot it, you guys?

6215
04:04:22,450 --> 04:04:24,370
I have to, like, close...

6216
04:04:24,370 --> 04:04:25,330
I have to, like...

6217
04:04:26,190 --> 04:04:27,230
Get out of the game.

6218
04:04:27,390 --> 04:04:28,170
So it doesn't really help me.

6219
04:04:35,860 --> 04:04:36,300
Shigyoseki.

6220
04:04:36,740 --> 04:04:38,680
The arching stone is the only stone with...

6221
04:04:38,680 --> 04:04:39,320
Okay, so...

6222
04:04:39,320 --> 04:04:41,040
I can probably remember the heart one.

6223
04:04:41,040 --> 04:04:41,880
The arching stone is a flat stone.

6224
04:04:42,140 --> 04:04:42,720
To a...

6225
04:04:42,720 --> 04:04:43,940
Similar to a stepping stone.

6226
04:04:45,260 --> 04:04:46,100
Reclining stone.

6227
04:04:46,280 --> 04:04:47,420
Neither has low...

6228
04:04:47,420 --> 04:04:50,180
Neither has low as the heart stone nor as tall...

6229
04:04:50,880 --> 04:04:52,260
As the branching stone.

6230
04:04:53,220 --> 04:04:54,000
Arching stone.

6231
04:04:54,160 --> 04:04:56,180
Only stone with a flat top wider than its base.

6232
04:04:56,720 --> 04:04:57,200
Alright.

6233
04:04:57,900 --> 04:04:58,720
Use a phone!

6234
04:04:58,960 --> 04:05:00,040
Oh my gosh, you're so true.

6235
04:05:00,320 --> 04:05:01,060
You're so right.

6236
04:05:04,140 --> 04:05:05,840
Take a picture with my phone.

6237
04:05:06,280 --> 04:05:06,520
Take a picture with my phone.

6238
04:05:06,520 --> 04:05:07,180
Haha, okay.

6239
04:05:07,920 --> 04:05:08,420
Perfect.

6240
04:05:09,000 --> 04:05:09,200
Oop.

6241
04:05:10,060 --> 04:05:11,580
Now we're good to go, baby.

6242
04:05:13,100 --> 04:05:13,700
Oops.

6243
04:05:14,480 --> 04:05:16,740
I saw someone say there's a face in the water.

6244
04:05:17,220 --> 04:05:17,520
Where?

6245
04:05:18,640 --> 04:05:19,880
I don't see anything.

6246
04:05:22,320 --> 04:05:23,920
Where's a face in the water?

6247
04:05:26,760 --> 04:05:27,360
Okay.

6248
04:05:27,360 --> 04:05:27,400
What?

6249
04:05:31,780 --> 04:05:33,220
No, I said why I can't...

6250
04:05:33,220 --> 04:05:35,120
I already said why I can't screen share, you guys.

6251
04:05:37,100 --> 04:05:37,620
Okay.

6252
04:05:38,420 --> 04:05:39,260
Soul stone.

6253
04:05:39,460 --> 04:05:40,260
Low vertical...

6254
04:05:41,320 --> 04:05:41,840
Stone.

6255
04:05:42,100 --> 04:05:43,600
Wide base and tapered top.

6256
04:05:44,580 --> 04:05:45,100
Okay.

6257
04:05:46,720 --> 04:05:47,760
I'm gonna...

6258
04:05:47,760 --> 04:05:48,500
Like...

6259
04:05:48,500 --> 04:05:49,820
This or this?

6260
04:05:50,860 --> 04:05:51,500
Um...

6261
04:05:51,500 --> 04:05:54,560
Heart stone is flat and is like a skipping stone.

6262
04:05:54,700 --> 04:05:56,160
So I imagine it's that one.

6263
04:05:57,180 --> 04:05:58,140
Arching stone.

6264
04:05:58,440 --> 04:06:02,920
Only stone with a flat top wider than its base.

6265
04:06:02,920 --> 04:06:05,460
So this one is the branching stone.

6266
04:06:08,460 --> 04:06:09,380
Face bottom right.

6267
04:06:12,540 --> 04:06:14,200
There's a hundred percent of face in the water.

6268
04:06:14,440 --> 04:06:14,780
What?

6269
04:06:18,860 --> 04:06:19,560
Um...

6270
04:06:19,560 --> 04:06:20,260
Ox stone.

6271
04:06:20,460 --> 04:06:21,420
Reclining stone.

6272
04:06:22,300 --> 04:06:23,540
Maybe this one.

6273
04:06:25,160 --> 04:06:26,500
Is this reclining?

6274
04:06:26,780 --> 04:06:28,440
It's kind of like a...

6275
04:06:28,440 --> 04:06:28,920
Leaning back.

6276
04:06:30,740 --> 04:06:31,440
Uh...

6277
04:06:32,460 --> 04:06:32,810
Vertical...

6278
04:06:33,160 --> 04:06:34,520
Low vertical stone.

6279
04:06:34,740 --> 04:06:35,960
Wide base, tapered top.

6280
04:06:36,100 --> 04:06:37,160
This is the soul stone.

6281
04:06:38,500 --> 04:06:39,200
Oh!

6282
04:06:41,200 --> 04:06:41,900
Hmm...

6283
04:06:41,900 --> 04:06:42,540
Strange.

6284
04:06:43,140 --> 04:06:45,200
I've seen those markings before.

6285
04:06:46,020 --> 04:06:46,540
Origami!

6286
04:06:46,960 --> 04:06:47,180
Oh!

6287
04:06:48,460 --> 04:06:48,780
Oh!

6288
04:06:50,440 --> 04:06:50,960
Wait.

6289
04:06:55,080 --> 04:06:58,860
The origami book in Takai's room would be helpful right about now.

6290
04:06:59,940 --> 04:07:00,980
Dear Marianne.

6291
04:07:01,220 --> 04:07:02,780
Thank you for your last letter.

6292
04:07:02,980 --> 04:07:04,460
It could not have come at a better time.

6293
04:07:05,380 --> 04:07:07,140
My mother is making me crazy!

6294
04:07:07,880 --> 04:07:09,440
We're beyond busy here with the festival.

6295
04:07:09,600 --> 04:07:11,440
And she wants to fire half of the staff.

6296
04:07:12,000 --> 04:07:12,360
Correction.

6297
04:07:12,660 --> 04:07:15,460
She has fired half of the staff.

6298
04:07:16,540 --> 04:07:19,700
If I ever become a weird perfectionist, smack me silly!

6299
04:07:20,260 --> 04:07:21,660
Yumi's birthday was yesterday.

6300
04:07:23,360 --> 04:07:23,800
Awww...

6301
04:07:26,060 --> 04:07:28,100
And not surprisingly, there was drama.

6302
04:07:28,420 --> 04:07:32,340
At dinner, my mother asked if she was ready to start learning how to run the ryokan.

6303
04:07:32,460 --> 04:07:33,680
And this led to a fight.

6304
04:07:34,140 --> 04:07:36,560
Everything is a sore subject with that girl these days.

6305
04:07:36,800 --> 04:07:37,840
This puberty.

6306
04:07:38,480 --> 04:07:41,980
But lately, mentioning her running the ryokan is pretty much just picking a fight.

6307
04:07:43,260 --> 04:07:45,640
I remember what it was like to be her age.

6308
04:07:45,780 --> 04:07:48,360
Wanting to see the world, but I never hated it here.

6309
04:07:48,540 --> 04:07:49,300
I don't get it.

6310
04:07:49,540 --> 04:07:50,620
I have to get back to work.

6311
04:07:51,160 --> 04:07:51,560
Keigu.

6312
04:07:52,060 --> 04:07:52,460
Kasumi.

6313
04:07:56,880 --> 04:07:58,640
I wonder if it makes a message when you fold it.

6314
04:07:58,680 --> 04:07:59,920
Yeah, that's what I'm curious about too.

6315
04:08:00,320 --> 04:08:01,580
Where's the face in the water?

6316
04:08:03,160 --> 04:08:03,560
That?

6317
04:08:03,840 --> 04:08:04,680
Looks like Otacon.

6318
04:08:06,840 --> 04:08:08,300
Where's the face in the water?

6319
04:08:10,120 --> 04:08:10,520
Where?

6320
04:08:12,480 --> 04:08:12,880
Where?

6321
04:08:14,900 --> 04:08:16,200
Where's the face in the water?

6322
04:08:16,960 --> 04:08:18,060
That looks like a skull.

6323
04:08:23,560 --> 04:08:23,920
Frog.

6324
04:08:31,700 --> 04:08:33,000
If there is one, I don't see it.

6325
04:08:33,040 --> 04:08:33,460
Me neither.

6326
04:08:34,680 --> 04:08:37,860
I bought your merch, but I didn't use the coupon boomer.

6327
04:08:38,480 --> 04:08:40,640
I'm ashamed, but without the free shipping code, it doubles the price.

6328
04:08:40,720 --> 04:08:41,420
No, no, no, no.

6329
04:08:41,640 --> 04:08:41,920
Don't wait.

6330
04:08:43,020 --> 04:08:46,500
I would much rather you save money than use my code.

6331
04:08:48,100 --> 04:08:48,880
Thank you.

6332
04:08:50,320 --> 04:08:52,640
My mom used to buy them for $2 at the supermarket.

6333
04:08:52,740 --> 04:08:53,720
This game is long.

6334
04:08:54,360 --> 04:08:55,540
This game is hella long.

6335
04:08:58,500 --> 04:08:59,620
I don't see a face.

6336
04:09:01,040 --> 04:09:02,280
I don't see a face.

6337
04:09:02,800 --> 04:09:04,280
I think I'm getting gas lit.

6338
04:09:04,540 --> 04:09:04,640
Okay.

6339
04:09:04,640 --> 04:09:06,700
To the Orog Army room.

6340
04:09:07,080 --> 04:09:07,540
Oops.

6341
04:09:09,160 --> 04:09:09,300
Okay.

6342
04:09:11,260 --> 04:09:12,900
Orog Army, Orog Army.

6343
04:09:13,820 --> 04:09:15,440
Orog Army, Orog Army.

6344
04:09:17,520 --> 04:09:18,000
Wrong.

6345
04:09:18,920 --> 04:09:19,400
Okay.

6346
04:09:19,640 --> 04:09:22,340
I should wait until Takai is gone before doing this.

6347
04:09:23,960 --> 04:09:24,440
What?

6348
04:09:24,620 --> 04:09:25,500
Go to bed, Grandma.

6349
04:09:25,840 --> 04:09:26,500
What time is it?

6350
04:09:26,980 --> 04:09:27,180
Nine.

6351
04:09:27,320 --> 04:09:27,840
Almost nine.

6352
04:09:28,120 --> 04:09:29,180
I think it says it's...

6353
04:09:29,180 --> 04:09:30,360
Hello, Nancy-san.

6354
04:09:30,600 --> 04:09:31,480
I'll let you go.

6355
04:09:31,480 --> 04:09:31,660
Come again.

6356
04:09:31,660 --> 04:09:33,040
I think it said until 10 p.m.

6357
04:09:36,360 --> 04:09:37,760
Can I sleep until 10?

6358
04:09:38,300 --> 04:09:39,060
10.30.

6359
04:09:39,400 --> 04:09:39,500
Okay.

6360
04:09:39,660 --> 04:09:40,760
Let's go sleep until 10.30.

6361
04:09:43,520 --> 04:09:45,480
Because then we can also get the...

6362
04:09:47,560 --> 04:09:48,000
The...

6363
04:09:48,580 --> 04:09:49,300
What's it called?

6364
04:09:52,120 --> 04:09:52,560
The...

6365
04:09:52,560 --> 04:09:53,400
The kettle.

6366
04:09:53,400 --> 04:09:53,440
Oh.

6367
04:09:55,640 --> 04:09:57,560
But yeah, this game is crazy long.

6368
04:09:58,100 --> 04:09:58,940
10...

6369
04:09:58,940 --> 04:09:59,600
30.

6370
04:10:04,680 --> 04:10:05,900
Do do do.

6371
04:10:06,800 --> 04:10:08,980
Do du du.

6372
04:10:08,980 --> 04:10:09,040
Do.

6373
04:10:09,040 --> 04:10:10,520
Do du du du.

6374
04:10:10,940 --> 04:10:11,880
Do du du.

6375
04:10:12,700 --> 04:10:13,420
Okay.

6376
04:10:14,280 --> 04:10:15,120
Um...

6377
04:10:15,120 --> 04:10:15,960
Sneaking Mission?

6378
04:10:16,580 --> 04:10:17,100
Good.

6379
04:10:17,320 --> 04:10:18,360
She's gone.

6380
04:10:19,600 --> 04:10:20,440
Yes!

6381
04:10:20,960 --> 04:10:21,500
Yes.

6382
04:10:22,040 --> 04:10:23,240
She left something.

6383
04:10:23,400 --> 04:10:23,800
Oh.

6384
04:10:23,800 --> 04:10:24,000
Oh!

6385
04:10:26,780 --> 04:10:28,400
Wow, grandma is so careless.

6386
04:10:29,500 --> 04:10:30,340
Holy cow!

6387
04:10:30,720 --> 04:10:34,020
Oh my gosh, I feel like we're making such great progress all of a sudden, you know?

6388
04:10:37,780 --> 04:10:38,220
Finally!

6389
04:10:38,440 --> 04:10:39,580
Oh, and there's a key!

6390
04:10:40,980 --> 04:10:44,240
Oh my gosh, we're making like crazy progress all of a sudden.

6391
04:10:46,560 --> 04:10:47,000
Okay.

6392
04:10:49,800 --> 04:10:51,060
What the hell does that mean?

6393
04:10:52,800 --> 04:10:54,160
A valley fold!

6394
04:10:55,420 --> 04:10:55,860
Wait.

6395
04:10:56,520 --> 04:10:57,880
Yeah, valley fold.

6396
04:11:02,580 --> 04:11:03,280
Oh, sure!

6397
04:11:03,440 --> 04:11:04,460
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for this!

6398
04:11:04,660 --> 04:11:07,420
Thank you!

6399
04:11:07,900 --> 04:11:08,920
Wait, what do you mean not quite?

6400
04:11:09,060 --> 04:11:09,560
Start over?

6401
04:11:09,740 --> 04:11:10,600
I just did what?

6402
04:11:12,280 --> 04:11:13,240
Mountain fold!

6403
04:11:13,920 --> 04:11:14,960
Or is it a crease?

6404
04:11:19,120 --> 04:11:20,100
Mountain fold!

6405
04:11:23,420 --> 04:11:23,860
Okay.

6406
04:11:31,370 --> 04:11:33,170
Fold... Fold to front?

6407
04:11:33,510 --> 04:11:34,830
Fold to front!

6408
04:11:47,530 --> 04:11:48,150
Uh...

6409
04:11:48,970 --> 04:11:49,590
Ooh...

6410
04:11:50,970 --> 04:11:52,570
Ooh, it's just straight.

6411
04:11:56,280 --> 04:11:57,480
It's just straight.

6412
04:12:06,760 --> 04:12:08,560
I don't think it's a mountain fold.

6413
04:12:08,780 --> 04:12:09,740
Another fold to front?

6414
04:12:10,040 --> 04:12:10,640
You think so?

6415
04:12:16,540 --> 04:12:17,500
Okay.

6416
04:12:17,860 --> 04:12:18,300
Uh...

6417
04:12:18,300 --> 04:12:18,900
This one...

6418
04:12:18,900 --> 04:12:20,600
It's a...

6419
04:12:20,600 --> 04:12:22,080
It's a...

6420
04:12:22,080 --> 04:12:22,700
Fold then unfold.

6421
04:12:27,120 --> 04:12:27,600
Okay.

6422
04:12:29,960 --> 04:12:30,900
Very nice.

6423
04:12:31,540 --> 04:12:32,780
Alright, five is...

6424
04:12:33,340 --> 04:12:33,660
Floop!

6425
04:12:34,060 --> 04:12:34,800
But half.

6426
04:12:35,620 --> 04:12:36,760
Fold behind?

6427
04:12:37,400 --> 04:12:38,620
Yeah, fold behind.

6428
04:12:40,480 --> 04:12:41,800
Fold to...

6429
04:12:41,800 --> 04:12:42,620
Back.

6430
04:12:43,060 --> 04:12:43,760
I think.

6431
04:12:44,800 --> 04:12:45,860
Please say yes.

6432
04:12:46,480 --> 04:12:46,620
Please say yes.

6433
04:12:47,260 --> 04:12:47,460
Oof!

6434
04:12:47,820 --> 04:12:48,040
Alright.

6435
04:12:48,320 --> 04:12:48,960
Number six.

6436
04:12:49,360 --> 04:12:49,800
Uh...

6437
04:12:49,800 --> 04:12:50,360
It's a little...

6438
04:12:50,360 --> 04:12:51,060
It's a...

6439
04:12:51,060 --> 04:12:51,620
Little bend.

6440
04:12:53,140 --> 04:12:54,520
What the hell does that mean?

6441
04:12:54,860 --> 04:12:55,460
Wait!

6442
04:12:56,000 --> 04:12:56,320
It's...

6443
04:12:56,320 --> 04:12:56,760
Oh wait!

6444
04:12:56,940 --> 04:12:57,780
It's a...

6445
04:12:57,780 --> 04:12:58,400
Push invert.

6446
04:12:58,980 --> 04:12:59,700
Push invert.

6447
04:13:00,000 --> 04:13:00,240
Okay.

6448
04:13:02,280 --> 04:13:03,840
This looks like bamboo.

6449
04:13:04,160 --> 04:13:06,980
I should search the property for something made out of that.

6450
04:13:08,880 --> 04:13:09,190
Ohhhh...

6451
04:13:12,720 --> 04:13:14,520
Good job, Nancy-san.

6452
04:13:15,440 --> 04:13:16,060
Bamboo.

6453
04:13:17,800 --> 04:13:18,420
Bamboo.

6454
04:13:19,560 --> 04:13:20,180
Bamboo.

6455
04:13:20,180 --> 04:13:20,200
Bamboo?

6456
04:13:23,660 --> 04:13:26,440
She's like, what is Nancy getting into right now?

6457
04:13:26,500 --> 04:13:26,900
Hi.

6458
04:13:27,660 --> 04:13:30,120
If you didn't work here, what would you do?

6459
04:13:30,400 --> 04:13:30,800
Hi.

6460
04:13:30,800 --> 04:13:30,880
I...

6461
04:13:30,880 --> 04:13:32,460
Yeah, the deer scare probably.

6462
04:13:32,740 --> 04:13:34,920
It's been so long since I've been asked that.

6463
04:13:35,460 --> 04:13:36,300
I don't know.

6464
04:13:37,040 --> 04:13:38,240
Something very different.

6465
04:13:39,040 --> 04:13:39,840
Something exciting.

6466
04:13:40,380 --> 04:13:41,180
With Lentaro.

6467
04:13:41,340 --> 04:13:42,380
I don't think you like him.

6468
04:13:42,480 --> 04:13:43,240
I should go.

6469
04:13:43,340 --> 04:13:44,320
I don't think you like him.

6470
04:13:44,320 --> 04:13:44,400
I'll talk to you later.

6471
04:13:44,820 --> 04:13:45,420
Okay, see ya.

6472
04:13:45,840 --> 04:13:46,900
Yeah, the water tipping thing.

6473
04:13:47,020 --> 04:13:47,980
Yeah, yeah, I think that's it.

6474
04:13:48,740 --> 04:13:50,680
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

6475
04:13:50,780 --> 04:13:51,720
Oh, my bad.

6476
04:13:52,280 --> 04:13:53,680
They're like, what is she getting into?

6477
04:13:53,840 --> 04:13:54,540
I'm just like...

6478
04:13:54,540 --> 04:13:55,940
That looks like the image on the letter.

6479
04:13:56,140 --> 04:13:57,860
I'm just like wandering the property.

6480
04:13:58,260 --> 04:14:01,400
It looks like I could pry this open if I had the right tool.

6481
04:14:01,940 --> 04:14:04,460
Sounds like we need Lentaro to go to sleep.

6482
04:14:06,800 --> 04:14:07,900
Are you still in here?

6483
04:14:09,700 --> 04:14:10,300
Hey, buddy.

6484
04:14:10,560 --> 04:14:10,660
Hi.

6485
04:14:11,940 --> 04:14:13,760
What's that wooden thing in the garden?

6486
04:14:14,340 --> 04:14:14,820
The tree?

6487
04:14:15,300 --> 04:14:15,800
No.

6488
04:14:16,100 --> 04:14:18,560
The wooden thing that makes the knocking noise.

6489
04:14:18,700 --> 04:14:19,300
Okay, to be fair.

6490
04:14:20,440 --> 04:14:20,620
No.

6491
04:14:21,060 --> 04:14:22,540
The thing...

6492
04:14:22,540 --> 04:14:23,820
I'm teasing.

6493
04:14:24,000 --> 04:14:27,720
To be fair, the wooden thing in the garden is not very specific.

6494
04:14:28,060 --> 04:14:28,620
What is it?

6495
04:14:29,040 --> 04:14:35,300
It uses flowing water to make weird knocking noises that scare away the deer so they don't eat all of the flowers.

6496
04:14:35,820 --> 04:14:37,120
Oh, that's neat.

6497
04:14:37,540 --> 04:14:38,320
Does it work?

6498
04:14:38,780 --> 04:14:39,520
I don't know.

6499
04:14:40,080 --> 04:14:43,320
Deer still eat the flowers, but it's hard to tell if they're scared or not.

6500
04:14:43,880 --> 04:14:46,640
Or that their expressions pretty much look the same.

6501
04:14:46,940 --> 04:14:48,020
Kinda like this.

6502
04:14:48,300 --> 04:14:49,700
Oh, don't look at me like that, please.

6503
04:14:49,940 --> 04:14:50,360
Oh, God.

6504
04:14:50,720 --> 04:14:51,060
So...

6505
04:14:51,060 --> 04:14:51,640
Oh, God, leave!

6506
04:14:55,300 --> 04:14:56,420
Yeah, let's...

6507
04:14:56,420 --> 04:14:58,140
Let's not do that again, Lentaro.

6508
04:15:02,460 --> 04:15:03,780
That was frightening.

6509
04:15:04,220 --> 04:15:05,380
I didn't like it.

6510
04:15:05,580 --> 04:15:07,720
Yeah, he looked exactly like the emoji.

6511
04:15:09,180 --> 04:15:09,820
Alright.

6512
04:15:10,200 --> 04:15:12,760
Now, let's sleep until 1am.

6513
04:15:19,750 --> 04:15:23,590
I don't think Nancy is getting enough sleep at this place.

6514
04:15:24,270 --> 04:15:24,910
I...

6515
04:15:24,910 --> 04:15:26,650
I worry a bit for her health.

6516
04:15:26,990 --> 04:15:30,850
We have her up, like, at all hours of the night.

6517
04:15:31,330 --> 04:15:32,530
And then...

6518
04:15:32,930 --> 04:15:33,930
She works...

6519
04:15:33,930 --> 04:15:36,650
I guess she has to wake up at 4am for work.

6520
04:15:36,650 --> 04:15:39,030
And then works until 7am.

6521
04:15:39,490 --> 04:15:41,530
And then does more investigating.

6522
04:15:42,150 --> 04:15:42,770
Like, damn.

6523
04:15:43,250 --> 04:15:44,270
She is crazy.

6524
04:15:44,950 --> 04:15:47,010
Okay, we've got several things going on here.

6525
04:15:48,210 --> 04:15:50,350
And time is of the essence.

6526
04:15:52,910 --> 04:15:54,390
First thing is...

6527
04:15:54,390 --> 04:15:56,070
We need to go sneak into Lentaro's place.

6528
04:16:01,540 --> 04:16:02,960
And we need...

6529
04:16:03,820 --> 04:16:04,360
Probably...

6530
04:16:05,020 --> 04:16:05,340
Something...

6531
04:16:05,340 --> 04:16:05,640
Here.

6532
04:16:07,060 --> 04:16:08,940
The music is getting so crazy.

6533
04:16:09,120 --> 04:16:09,340
Ooh!

6534
04:16:10,080 --> 04:16:11,440
I don't recognize this.

6535
04:16:11,520 --> 04:16:12,920
I feel like the soundtrack is changing.

6536
04:16:13,740 --> 04:16:14,280
Ah!

6537
04:16:14,500 --> 04:16:15,240
Screw the driver!

6538
04:16:15,380 --> 04:16:16,200
That's not my...

6539
04:16:16,200 --> 04:16:16,480
Nope.

6540
04:16:16,980 --> 04:16:19,220
That is not my first pick, but...

6541
04:16:19,220 --> 04:16:19,380
Okay.

6542
04:16:24,160 --> 04:16:24,900
There we go.

6543
04:16:25,100 --> 04:16:25,320
Okay.

6544
04:16:28,120 --> 04:16:28,420
Screwdriver!

6545
04:16:31,720 --> 04:16:36,200
This must have meant something to Kasumi if she went through so much trouble to hide it.

6546
04:16:40,600 --> 04:16:41,200
Okay.

6547
04:16:43,280 --> 04:16:43,880
Wait.

6548
04:16:45,420 --> 04:16:46,740
You don't think...

6549
04:16:47,440 --> 04:16:48,520
Is this a nanogram?

6550
04:16:48,920 --> 04:16:49,720
Oh my god!

6551
04:16:54,480 --> 04:16:55,080
No.

6552
04:16:55,580 --> 04:16:56,560
Is it a nanogram?

6553
04:16:56,860 --> 04:16:58,340
Oh my god!

6554
04:16:58,340 --> 04:16:59,660
Oh my god!

6555
04:16:59,820 --> 04:17:00,840
Oh my god!

6556
04:17:01,400 --> 04:17:02,640
Oh my god!

6557
04:17:03,380 --> 04:17:04,620
Oh my god!

6558
04:17:06,900 --> 04:17:07,440
Yippee!

6559
04:17:07,780 --> 04:17:07,980
Okay.

6560
04:17:09,120 --> 04:17:11,460
Now we gotta try and do this one too.

6561
04:17:12,240 --> 04:17:12,780
Which...

6562
04:17:13,130 --> 04:17:15,120
This thing confuses the heck out of me.

6563
04:17:15,220 --> 04:17:16,700
I don't understand...

6564
04:17:17,380 --> 04:17:19,000
At all what you're trying to do.

6565
04:17:20,380 --> 04:17:21,960
What if I got it first, Troy?

6566
04:17:25,580 --> 04:17:26,100
Wait.

6567
04:17:35,040 --> 04:17:36,840
The final nanogram...

6568
04:17:36,840 --> 04:17:37,680
Nonogram.

6569
04:17:38,040 --> 04:17:39,140
Is that even saying nanogram?

6570
04:17:39,800 --> 04:17:40,360
It's a nonogram.

6571
04:17:40,800 --> 04:17:41,560
I'm stupid.

6572
04:17:41,820 --> 04:17:42,060
Sorry.

6573
04:17:47,120 --> 04:17:49,180
Turn on all the lights without overlapping.

6574
04:17:49,900 --> 04:17:50,080
No!

6575
04:17:51,640 --> 04:17:52,120
Oh!

6576
04:17:52,480 --> 04:17:52,960
These...

6577
04:17:52,960 --> 04:17:53,500
Wait.

6578
04:17:56,020 --> 04:17:57,560
There has to be an overlap, no?

6579
04:17:58,180 --> 04:17:58,760
Hold on.

6580
04:17:58,820 --> 04:17:59,260
There's a manual.

6581
04:18:03,240 --> 04:18:03,760
Uh...

6582
04:18:03,760 --> 04:18:06,700
Our system uses an 8x8 grid with a unique colored entry code.

6583
04:18:06,940 --> 04:18:07,380
Mito.

6584
04:18:08,020 --> 04:18:08,500
Hi.

6585
04:18:08,940 --> 04:18:09,400
Hello!

6586
04:18:13,440 --> 04:18:13,960
Um...

6587
04:18:13,960 --> 04:18:16,160
Unique colored entry code designed by the user.

6588
04:18:16,240 --> 04:18:20,540
The colors are then split and encoded into five key cards by our team of specialists.

6589
04:18:20,540 --> 04:18:21,200
With...

6590
04:18:21,200 --> 04:18:23,920
Extra squares on each card for added security.

6591
04:18:24,240 --> 04:18:27,860
To open the secured compartment, place the key cards into the slots in the correct...

6592
04:18:27,860 --> 04:18:31,880
Layering order and rotate their displays until they match the entry code pattern.

6593
04:18:32,320 --> 04:18:34,680
I don't think we know the entry code pattern.

6594
04:18:35,300 --> 04:18:36,540
Now that I think about it.

6595
04:18:37,220 --> 04:18:39,300
I don't think we know the entry code pattern.

6596
04:18:40,800 --> 04:18:42,340
Maybe the code is in the PC.

6597
04:18:42,640 --> 04:18:42,760
Oh!

6598
04:18:43,100 --> 04:18:43,180
Oh!

6599
04:18:43,780 --> 04:18:44,260
Then...

6600
04:18:44,260 --> 04:18:44,920
We gotta...

6601
04:18:44,920 --> 04:18:45,640
We could do that.

6602
04:18:49,000 --> 04:18:49,480
Um...

6603
04:18:51,240 --> 04:18:51,800
You?

6604
04:18:58,580 --> 04:18:59,740
Ooh, what if it's...

6605
04:18:59,740 --> 04:19:01,460
What if it shows a ghastly face?

6606
04:19:01,780 --> 04:19:04,000
I need to hurry before someone catches me.

6607
04:19:04,100 --> 04:19:04,320
Yes!

6608
04:19:04,420 --> 04:19:04,700
Hurry!

6609
04:19:04,940 --> 04:19:05,340
Caught!

6610
04:19:05,540 --> 04:19:06,820
I was waiting for you!

6611
04:19:07,280 --> 04:19:07,620
Okay.

6612
04:19:09,380 --> 04:19:11,560
I need a dictionary to translate that.

6613
04:19:11,700 --> 04:19:13,620
Nancy Drew, just read it!

6614
04:19:13,980 --> 04:19:15,260
Read the password!

6615
04:19:17,260 --> 04:19:17,820
Okay.

6616
04:19:18,060 --> 04:19:18,680
Now open it.

6617
04:19:19,300 --> 04:19:20,400
Nancy Drew, open it.

6618
04:19:20,800 --> 04:19:21,400
Nancy Drew!

6619
04:19:23,100 --> 04:19:24,560
What am I supposed to do?

6620
04:19:26,400 --> 04:19:27,480
I didn't do it.

6621
04:19:27,620 --> 04:19:28,800
Wait, but I clicked on it.

6622
04:19:37,920 --> 04:19:40,340
I need to hurry before someone catches me.

6623
04:19:40,540 --> 04:19:40,780
Okay.

6624
04:19:42,260 --> 04:19:43,020
Oh, there we go.

6625
04:19:43,060 --> 04:19:43,360
There we go.

6626
04:19:43,720 --> 04:19:45,180
It was red when I clicked it.

6627
04:19:45,240 --> 04:19:45,560
I swear.

6628
04:19:47,300 --> 04:19:47,700
Ooh!

6629
04:19:49,520 --> 04:19:49,960
Ooh!

6630
04:19:50,260 --> 04:19:50,320
Oh!

6631
04:19:51,040 --> 04:19:52,900
I should get the teapot off the fire.

6632
04:19:55,460 --> 04:19:56,120
Holy cow.

6633
04:19:56,500 --> 04:19:57,220
What did it say?

6634
04:19:57,420 --> 04:19:58,320
I missed it.

6635
04:20:05,140 --> 04:20:05,840
Wait, what is it?

6636
04:20:05,840 --> 04:20:05,880
Wait, what is it?

6637
04:20:05,880 --> 04:20:07,060
I need to translate that.

6638
04:20:09,840 --> 04:20:10,200
Takakawa.

6639
04:20:10,600 --> 04:20:10,700
Okay.

6640
04:20:11,300 --> 04:20:11,660
Takakawa.

6641
04:20:12,220 --> 04:20:12,580
Okay.

6642
04:20:14,680 --> 04:20:15,040
Oops.

6643
04:20:21,100 --> 04:20:22,140
Please, let me go in there.

6644
04:20:22,260 --> 04:20:22,420
Okay.

6645
04:20:23,860 --> 04:20:24,400
Oh, God.

6646
04:20:24,500 --> 04:20:26,480
This thing is getting more and more defective.

6647
04:20:26,480 --> 04:20:27,120
Defective.

6648
04:20:27,120 --> 04:20:29,400
The password I need is in that envelope in the puzzle box.

6649
04:20:31,220 --> 04:20:31,620
Ka.

6650
04:20:32,160 --> 04:20:32,320
Ka.

6651
04:20:35,260 --> 04:20:36,060
Japanese keyboard.

6652
04:20:36,460 --> 04:20:37,040
Where's the wa?

6653
04:20:37,600 --> 04:20:37,940
Wa.

6654
04:20:39,620 --> 04:20:40,420
Oh!

6655
04:20:42,600 --> 04:20:43,800
Room tracker.

6656
04:20:47,240 --> 04:20:49,200
Sasaki, Sasaki, Sasaki, Sasaki.

6657
04:20:49,200 --> 04:20:50,020
Chan!

6658
04:20:52,260 --> 04:20:53,340
We're in, baby.

6659
04:20:53,940 --> 04:20:55,260
This is all that's on here.

6660
04:20:57,400 --> 04:20:58,740
Williams just left.

6661
04:20:58,900 --> 04:21:00,500
What if there was someone that checked in?

6662
04:21:01,000 --> 04:21:04,320
Arrived, like, far long ago but never departed.

6663
04:21:04,800 --> 04:21:07,400
Looks like this is as far back as the records go.

6664
04:21:08,180 --> 04:21:08,520
Okay.

6665
04:21:11,960 --> 04:21:13,240
What do I need this for?

6666
04:21:18,450 --> 04:21:20,110
Sasaki, Johnny Sasaki.

6667
04:21:20,110 --> 04:21:20,830
Hahaha.

6668
04:21:26,230 --> 04:21:27,970
Yeah, what does this tell me, actually?

6669
04:21:28,870 --> 04:21:29,990
What, what does this...

6670
04:21:31,710 --> 04:21:33,690
What was Savannah's last name?

6671
04:21:38,130 --> 04:21:38,770
Woodum.

6672
04:21:39,530 --> 04:21:40,170
Woodham.

6673
04:21:45,000 --> 04:21:45,080
Oh!

6674
04:21:46,160 --> 04:21:46,800
Nah!

6675
04:21:47,100 --> 04:21:47,540
Inai!

6676
04:21:51,290 --> 04:21:51,930
Arifur.

6677
04:21:52,750 --> 04:21:53,370
Arifur.

6678
04:21:53,510 --> 04:21:54,070
Welcome to membership.

6679
04:21:54,270 --> 04:21:54,810
Thank you.

6680
04:21:55,650 --> 04:21:56,290
Woodham.

6681
04:21:57,190 --> 04:21:57,830
Inai.

6682
04:21:58,290 --> 04:21:59,070
She's not there.

6683
04:21:59,070 --> 04:22:00,490
Sokolav, where?

6684
04:22:01,670 --> 04:22:02,770
Sokolav, where?

6685
04:22:04,710 --> 04:22:06,010
No way!

6686
04:22:06,510 --> 04:22:09,050
We got Johnny Sasaki and Sokolav still.

6687
04:22:14,870 --> 04:22:16,030
Oh my gosh.

6688
04:22:16,450 --> 04:22:17,330
Sokolav.

6689
04:22:21,380 --> 04:22:22,900
This poor thing.

6690
04:22:23,440 --> 04:22:24,740
If this poor cat...

6691
04:22:24,740 --> 04:22:25,420
Oh my gosh.

6692
04:22:26,600 --> 04:22:27,060
Okay.

6693
04:22:28,580 --> 04:22:30,740
Well, now we have something to call her about.

6694
04:22:31,960 --> 04:22:33,060
This we still...

6695
04:22:34,780 --> 04:22:35,240
Need.

6696
04:22:35,980 --> 04:22:38,300
I don't know what the pattern is.

6697
04:22:38,780 --> 04:22:41,040
And it feels too difficult to brute force.

6698
04:22:43,180 --> 04:22:43,640
So...

6699
04:22:43,640 --> 04:22:44,240
Okay.

6700
04:22:48,390 --> 04:22:49,750
Wait, is that the pattern?

6701
04:22:49,930 --> 04:22:50,550
Wait, what do you mean?

6702
04:22:50,550 --> 04:22:51,870
I'm looking at the pattern.

6703
04:22:52,190 --> 04:22:53,230
Wait, what do you mean?

6704
04:22:54,430 --> 04:22:54,610
Wait, what do you mean?

6705
04:22:55,650 --> 04:22:56,930
Oh, this?

6706
04:22:57,850 --> 04:22:58,610
Oh!

6707
04:23:02,530 --> 04:23:03,970
That's the pattern?

6708
04:23:17,240 --> 04:23:18,000
Huh?

6709
04:23:20,660 --> 04:23:22,680
You have to layer it.

6710
04:23:22,800 --> 04:23:23,060
Yeah.

6711
04:23:24,500 --> 04:23:24,940
Okay.

6712
04:23:24,940 --> 04:23:25,100
Okay.

6713
04:23:25,300 --> 04:23:26,660
Let's just put that in.

6714
04:23:29,300 --> 04:23:30,080
This is like...

6715
04:23:31,600 --> 04:23:34,180
I don't think it really matters which way I put these in.

6716
04:23:34,300 --> 04:23:34,460
Yeah.

6717
04:23:34,720 --> 04:23:34,840
Okay.

6718
04:23:34,900 --> 04:23:36,700
It doesn't really matter which one goes in where.

6719
04:23:37,360 --> 04:23:37,800
Oh, whoops.

6720
04:23:37,940 --> 04:23:38,120
Oh.

6721
04:23:38,320 --> 04:23:38,580
Okay.

6722
04:23:39,840 --> 04:23:40,280
So...

6723
04:23:40,280 --> 04:23:41,000
Okay.

6724
04:23:41,460 --> 04:23:42,040
Hold on.

6725
04:23:42,300 --> 04:23:42,840
Hold on.

6726
04:23:43,020 --> 04:23:43,260
Okay.

6727
04:23:43,440 --> 04:23:43,680
Okay.

6728
04:23:43,840 --> 04:23:44,060
Okay.

6729
04:23:44,060 --> 04:23:44,880
Let's just put here.

6730
04:23:45,640 --> 04:23:46,060
You.

6731
04:23:47,300 --> 04:23:47,740
You.

6732
04:23:48,660 --> 04:23:49,560
Wait, what the...

6733
04:23:49,560 --> 04:23:50,380
It has to, no?

6734
04:23:53,000 --> 04:23:55,060
I wish I could see the pattern.

6735
04:23:59,800 --> 04:24:00,240
Without...

6736
04:24:00,240 --> 04:24:00,440
What?

6737
04:24:05,460 --> 04:24:06,760
Do red first.

6738
04:24:11,660 --> 04:24:12,420
Oh, wait.

6739
04:24:12,440 --> 04:24:13,420
I think I get it.

6740
04:24:15,040 --> 04:24:15,480
Oh!

6741
04:24:15,840 --> 04:24:16,140
Oh!

6742
04:24:16,320 --> 04:24:17,260
I think I get it.

6743
04:24:17,720 --> 04:24:18,160
Ow!

6744
04:24:18,260 --> 04:24:20,040
And I can see it if I hover over.

6745
04:24:20,460 --> 04:24:21,460
Okay, okay, okay.

6746
04:24:21,920 --> 04:24:23,980
So it would probably be...

6747
04:24:26,140 --> 04:24:27,420
What's green look like?

6748
04:24:39,440 --> 04:24:40,360
No, I...

6749
04:24:40,360 --> 04:24:40,640
Oh, wait.

6750
04:24:40,860 --> 04:24:42,060
Purple can be...

6751
04:24:42,060 --> 04:24:42,900
Like that.

6752
04:24:46,900 --> 04:24:48,220
Wait, didn't I get it?

6753
04:24:51,720 --> 04:24:52,420
Oh, wait.

6754
04:24:53,680 --> 04:24:54,180
Ah!

6755
04:24:54,940 --> 04:24:55,180
Wait.

6756
04:24:56,860 --> 04:24:57,600
Oh, my God.

6757
04:24:57,620 --> 04:24:58,420
I'm so close.

6758
04:25:00,320 --> 04:25:01,760
I'm so stinking close.

6759
04:25:04,760 --> 04:25:05,420
Uh...

6760
04:25:09,310 --> 04:25:10,300
So maybe...

6761
04:25:10,630 --> 04:25:12,850
We all just shift these down one.

6762
04:25:14,490 --> 04:25:15,150
No.

6763
04:25:20,090 --> 04:25:20,750
Oh!

6764
04:25:24,210 --> 04:25:24,870
Yeah!

6765
04:25:26,210 --> 04:25:27,290
I'm a genius.

6766
04:25:28,050 --> 04:25:30,530
To all rooms ending in eight, nine.

6767
04:25:30,930 --> 04:25:31,550
Oh, okay.

6768
04:25:32,950 --> 04:25:35,310
To open all rooms ending in eight or nine.

6769
04:25:35,310 --> 04:25:35,890
Okay.

6770
04:25:36,970 --> 04:25:38,190
All right.

6771
04:25:38,690 --> 04:25:39,190
Let's go.

6772
04:25:41,110 --> 04:25:41,590
Okay.

6773
04:25:42,870 --> 04:25:43,350
Okay.

6774
04:25:43,350 --> 04:25:45,530
So now we...

6775
04:25:46,010 --> 04:25:46,490
Uh...

6776
04:25:46,910 --> 04:25:47,390
Okay.

6777
04:25:47,710 --> 04:25:48,830
We got the password.

6778
04:25:49,210 --> 04:25:50,590
We got a nonogram thing.

6779
04:25:51,330 --> 04:25:52,690
We got...

6780
04:25:54,870 --> 04:25:55,350
Rooms...

6781
04:25:55,830 --> 04:25:56,550
Key room...

6782
04:25:56,550 --> 04:25:58,990
Key to rooms...

6783
04:25:58,990 --> 04:25:59,790
Eight or nine.

6784
04:26:03,700 --> 04:26:07,320
What's with the music of waiting for Nancy to get stabbed randomly?

6785
04:26:07,700 --> 04:26:08,060
No.

6786
04:26:08,200 --> 04:26:09,240
She's getting haunted.

6787
04:26:12,320 --> 04:26:12,760
Uh...

6788
04:26:13,760 --> 04:26:14,200
Um...

6789
04:26:14,200 --> 04:26:15,300
How big is Nancy?

6790
04:26:15,440 --> 04:26:16,640
She's got a hammer space.

6791
04:26:16,860 --> 04:26:18,080
It's as big as she wants it to be.

6792
04:26:19,940 --> 04:26:20,380
Okay.

6793
04:26:22,480 --> 04:26:22,920
Okay.

6794
04:26:23,240 --> 04:26:23,320
Okay.

6795
04:26:23,540 --> 04:26:23,740
Okay.

6796
04:26:23,980 --> 04:26:24,040
Okay.

6797
04:26:24,280 --> 04:26:26,180
And then we got this mysterious little key.

6798
04:26:27,000 --> 04:26:29,000
Which I feel like I saw...

6799
04:26:29,000 --> 04:26:29,700
Chest key.

6800
04:26:30,240 --> 04:26:32,180
I feel like I saw...

6801
04:26:36,540 --> 04:26:37,380
That...

6802
04:26:38,160 --> 04:26:38,580
Somewhere.

6803
04:26:39,300 --> 04:26:40,420
You think it's...

6804
04:26:40,420 --> 04:26:40,900
Um...

6805
04:26:40,900 --> 04:26:41,280
Hold on.

6806
04:26:46,340 --> 04:26:47,180
Uh...

6807
04:26:49,870 --> 04:26:50,710
Is it...

6808
04:26:50,710 --> 04:26:51,130
This?

6809
04:26:51,130 --> 04:26:51,810
I wonder.

6810
04:26:52,490 --> 04:26:53,050
Oh!

6811
04:26:53,490 --> 04:26:53,970
Ooh!

6812
04:26:57,210 --> 04:26:58,330
Dear Marianne.

6813
04:26:58,390 --> 04:26:59,310
You're my best friend.

6814
04:26:59,650 --> 04:27:00,650
You've always been.

6815
04:27:00,970 --> 04:27:02,010
I want you to know...

6816
04:27:02,010 --> 04:27:03,470
That no matter what happens...

6817
04:27:03,470 --> 04:27:05,210
You made my life happier.

6818
04:27:05,530 --> 04:27:05,990
Safer.

6819
04:27:06,190 --> 04:27:07,310
More interesting place.

6820
04:27:07,750 --> 04:27:09,230
You have a beautiful family.

6821
04:27:09,570 --> 04:27:11,530
You should be very proud of the life you've made.

6822
04:27:11,650 --> 04:27:12,670
Is this a...

6823
04:27:13,270 --> 04:27:13,590
Okay.

6824
04:27:13,810 --> 04:27:15,350
This isn't like a...

6825
04:27:15,350 --> 04:27:16,730
Like a...

6826
04:27:17,830 --> 04:27:18,750
A note.

6827
04:27:18,930 --> 04:27:20,830
That you leave before you leave, right?

6828
04:27:24,070 --> 04:27:26,950
You deserve all the happiness in life and I hope it finds you.

6829
04:27:27,190 --> 04:27:28,690
I'm in a strange mood these days.

6830
04:27:28,950 --> 04:27:30,270
I don't know what's come over me.

6831
04:27:30,430 --> 04:27:31,130
I worry.

6832
04:27:31,310 --> 04:27:32,910
I worry about just everything.

6833
04:27:33,210 --> 04:27:35,090
It's like I can see behind everything.

6834
04:27:35,310 --> 04:27:36,390
Like I can see the...

6835
04:27:36,390 --> 04:27:38,370
Mechanics that move everything and everyone.

6836
04:27:38,610 --> 04:27:40,050
I don't know how to explain it.

6837
04:27:40,230 --> 04:27:42,450
It's like I've stepped outside of my life as if...

6838
04:27:42,450 --> 04:27:43,250
As I know it.

6839
04:27:43,410 --> 04:27:45,850
And no matter how much I try to step back in...

6840
04:27:45,850 --> 04:27:46,830
I can't.

6841
04:27:46,930 --> 04:27:47,990
I don't fit anymore.

6842
04:27:47,990 --> 04:27:49,810
I fit less and less every day.

6843
04:27:50,030 --> 04:27:50,850
I'm scared.

6844
04:27:51,870 --> 04:27:55,030
Every night I go to bed hoping the feeling will be gone when I wake up.

6845
04:27:55,450 --> 04:27:55,530
Oh.

6846
04:27:56,310 --> 04:27:56,950
Thank you.

6847
04:27:57,630 --> 04:27:58,190
It's so...

6848
04:27:58,190 --> 04:27:58,790
It's so big.

6849
04:28:00,570 --> 04:28:01,810
And some wire.

6850
04:28:05,110 --> 04:28:05,590
Oh.

6851
04:28:05,730 --> 04:28:06,510
I can't take that?

6852
04:28:11,450 --> 04:28:11,930
Okay.

6853
04:28:15,570 --> 04:28:16,130
Some...

6854
04:28:16,130 --> 04:28:16,710
Some...

6855
04:28:16,710 --> 04:28:17,650
What is this?

6856
04:28:17,770 --> 04:28:19,330
It's like a copper wire or something?

6857
04:28:20,990 --> 04:28:22,490
There's something else behind the note.

6858
04:28:23,910 --> 04:28:24,470
No.

6859
04:28:24,730 --> 04:28:25,410
I think...

6860
04:28:25,930 --> 04:28:27,010
I think it's like...

6861
04:28:27,010 --> 04:28:29,950
The note is shoved into the letter and it's torn.

6862
04:28:30,690 --> 04:28:31,530
Like that.

6863
04:28:31,750 --> 04:28:32,350
I think.

6864
04:28:40,400 --> 04:28:42,180
It's really unnerving when there's no music.

6865
04:28:42,620 --> 04:28:43,480
I'm gonna save.

6866
04:28:43,480 --> 04:28:44,240
Cause I'm scared.

6867
04:28:48,280 --> 04:28:49,320
Where'd the music go?

6868
04:28:55,980 --> 04:28:57,060
The silence.

6869
04:29:00,950 --> 04:29:01,590
Wait.

6870
04:29:04,150 --> 04:29:06,450
It's never been gone for this long has...

6871
04:29:06,450 --> 04:29:07,250
Oh, there it is.

6872
04:29:07,370 --> 04:29:07,470
Okay.

6873
04:29:07,930 --> 04:29:10,050
Oh my gosh.

6874
04:29:10,050 --> 04:29:11,110
Don't scare me.

6875
04:29:11,410 --> 04:29:11,570
Okay.

6876
04:29:12,210 --> 04:29:13,730
This room ends in nine.

6877
04:29:18,050 --> 04:29:18,690
Okay.

6878
04:29:21,730 --> 04:29:22,110
Wait.

6879
04:29:22,550 --> 04:29:23,350
Oh, nevermind.

6880
04:29:25,510 --> 04:29:26,290
Anything in here?

6881
04:29:26,870 --> 04:29:27,610
Any ghosts?

6882
04:29:30,150 --> 04:29:31,910
Guys, I might actually end it...

6883
04:29:31,910 --> 04:29:32,930
Here though.

6884
04:29:34,450 --> 04:29:36,750
I didn't want to finish today, but I think we got a lot more.

6885
04:29:36,830 --> 04:29:37,010
Hold on.

6886
04:29:37,110 --> 04:29:37,550
I'm gonna look at...

6887
04:29:37,550 --> 04:29:41,310
I'm gonna look at the walkthrough and see where we're at and how much longer it shows.

6888
04:29:42,550 --> 04:29:43,490
Oh, let's see.

6889
04:29:57,400 --> 04:29:57,880
Um...

6890
04:29:57,880 --> 04:29:58,540
Oh, wait.

6891
04:30:02,300 --> 04:30:02,780
Wait.

6892
04:30:04,580 --> 04:30:05,060
Wait.

6893
04:30:05,200 --> 04:30:06,800
I don't think actually there's that much left.

6894
04:30:11,090 --> 04:30:12,050
I think...

6895
04:30:12,050 --> 04:30:13,070
Oh, wait.

6896
04:30:13,130 --> 04:30:13,910
No, there's a couple days.

6897
04:30:14,870 --> 04:30:15,690
Oh, no, no, no.

6898
04:30:15,850 --> 04:30:16,070
Sorry.

6899
04:30:16,290 --> 04:30:17,190
I scrolled a little fast.

6900
04:30:17,430 --> 04:30:19,950
I think it might be a bit shorter next stream, but that's okay.

6901
04:30:21,690 --> 04:30:23,050
You got at least an hour.

6902
04:30:23,370 --> 04:30:24,030
Yeah, I think...

6903
04:30:24,030 --> 04:30:24,850
I think at least.

6904
04:30:25,610 --> 04:30:26,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6905
04:30:28,630 --> 04:30:29,010
So...

6906
04:30:31,090 --> 04:30:31,850
We will...

6907
04:30:33,470 --> 04:30:35,290
It's already been four and a half hours anyway.

6908
04:30:37,090 --> 04:30:37,850
We will...

6909
04:30:37,850 --> 04:30:39,110
We will finish this.

6910
04:30:40,430 --> 04:30:40,990
Uh...

6911
04:30:43,750 --> 04:30:44,310
Mmm...

6912
04:30:44,310 --> 04:30:44,530
Dang.

6913
04:30:44,790 --> 04:30:45,770
If only I...

6914
04:30:45,770 --> 04:30:47,470
If only I didn't...

6915
04:30:47,470 --> 04:30:48,770
I would have finished this Saturday.

6916
04:30:49,790 --> 04:30:51,670
If I wasn't doing...

6917
04:30:53,550 --> 04:30:54,110
Uh...

6918
04:30:54,110 --> 04:30:54,770
Half-Life.

6919
04:30:55,470 --> 04:30:56,650
Since I moved it then.

6920
04:31:00,150 --> 04:31:00,710
Hmm...

6921
04:31:03,210 --> 04:31:05,050
Yeah, we made a bunch of progress today.

6922
04:31:05,810 --> 04:31:06,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6923
04:31:08,750 --> 04:31:09,150
Uh...

6924
04:31:10,210 --> 04:31:11,510
I'll find the time.

6925
04:31:11,710 --> 04:31:13,790
Because I feel like we don't have that much left.

6926
04:31:14,830 --> 04:31:17,930
So I'm like, maybe I can just double it up with something else this week.

6927
04:31:20,290 --> 04:31:20,690
Hmm...

6928
04:31:20,690 --> 04:31:22,850
Maybe instead of the YouTube games, I'd finish it.

6929
04:31:23,770 --> 04:31:24,750
That would be tomorrow.

6930
04:31:26,030 --> 04:31:27,930
Maybe instead of the YouTube games, I'd finish it.

6931
04:31:28,010 --> 04:31:29,670
And then I can move the YouTube games to another day.

6932
04:31:33,640 --> 04:31:34,040
Hmm...

6933
04:31:34,040 --> 04:31:35,280
The YouTube games...

6934
04:31:36,100 --> 04:31:37,120
Thanks, Try Princess!

6935
04:31:39,800 --> 04:31:40,200
Hmm...

6936
04:31:44,260 --> 04:31:44,660
Hmm...

6937
04:31:44,660 --> 04:31:46,380
And then I can move those to another day.

6938
04:31:46,500 --> 04:31:48,060
And then that would be before...

6939
04:31:48,700 --> 04:31:49,100
Doki.

6940
04:31:50,100 --> 04:31:51,420
Because I'd like to finish it up.

6941
04:31:52,580 --> 04:31:54,040
I thought you were doing Visage...

6942
04:31:54,040 --> 04:31:54,880
Visage with...

6943
04:31:54,880 --> 04:31:55,780
Tomorrow with Doki too.

6944
04:31:56,000 --> 04:31:56,240
Yeah!

6945
04:31:56,440 --> 04:31:56,860
I am.

6946
04:31:57,240 --> 04:31:58,340
That's why I would do this.

6947
04:31:58,460 --> 04:31:58,820
And then...

6948
04:31:59,400 --> 04:32:00,040
With Doki.

6949
04:32:04,540 --> 04:32:05,340
Yeah, so...

6950
04:32:05,340 --> 04:32:05,760
Okay.

6951
04:32:07,300 --> 04:32:08,820
Then we will...

6952
04:32:09,540 --> 04:32:10,440
Do it tomorrow.

6953
04:32:10,700 --> 04:32:11,400
We'll finish the game tomorrow.

6954
04:32:12,040 --> 04:32:12,920
Thanks for the stream, Rinto.

6955
04:32:13,140 --> 04:32:15,300
Can't wait to see the Nonogram powers in action next stream.

6956
04:32:15,620 --> 04:32:16,120
Have a good rest.

6957
04:32:16,400 --> 04:32:17,000
Thank you!

6958
04:32:17,320 --> 04:32:18,000
Thank you, guys!

6959
04:32:18,440 --> 04:32:19,500
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

6960
04:32:20,800 --> 04:32:21,240
And...

6961
04:32:22,240 --> 04:32:22,680
Yeah...

6962
04:32:22,680 --> 04:32:23,340
Austin, Nadia.

6963
04:32:23,500 --> 04:32:24,420
Thank you so much for the podcast.

6964
04:32:24,580 --> 04:32:25,260
And thank you!

6965
04:32:25,820 --> 04:32:26,260
Yes.

6966
04:32:26,480 --> 04:32:27,460
We will finish this tomorrow.

6967
04:32:27,900 --> 04:32:30,500
Sorry, I'll move the YouTube games to sometime next week.

6968
04:32:32,480 --> 04:32:32,920
And...

6969
04:32:33,520 --> 04:32:34,260
We will...

6970
04:32:34,260 --> 04:32:36,260
Because I really wanted to finish this up today.

6971
04:32:36,440 --> 04:32:37,080
But that's okay.

6972
04:32:37,080 --> 04:32:37,160
Bye.

6973
04:32:39,040 --> 04:32:39,880
That's a-okay.

6974
04:32:42,600 --> 04:32:44,300
It will be in the middle of the day.

6975
04:32:44,420 --> 04:32:45,080
I apologize, but...

6976
04:32:46,800 --> 04:32:47,180
Um...

6977
04:32:47,180 --> 04:32:47,400
Yeah!

6978
04:32:48,420 --> 04:32:51,520
Did you notice Doki not using the 0-0-0 Ice...

6979
04:32:51,920 --> 04:32:52,620
Monkey meta?

6980
04:32:52,920 --> 04:32:55,160
I sent her a picture of...

6981
04:32:55,160 --> 04:32:55,520
Hold on.

6982
04:32:55,640 --> 04:32:55,980
Let me see.

6983
04:32:56,100 --> 04:32:56,360
Hold on.

6984
04:32:56,440 --> 04:32:57,280
I did save, right?

6985
04:32:59,980 --> 04:33:00,880
Let me close the game.

6986
04:33:01,020 --> 04:33:01,700
I sent her!

6987
04:33:01,840 --> 04:33:03,620
I was like, hey Doki, look at my...

6988
04:33:03,620 --> 04:33:04,780
Look at my monkey.

6989
04:33:06,100 --> 04:33:06,480
Um...

6990
04:33:07,220 --> 04:33:09,520
My monkey setup...

6991
04:33:11,220 --> 04:33:11,660
Uh...

6992
04:33:11,660 --> 04:33:13,020
I didn't die on this one yet.

6993
04:33:14,300 --> 04:33:14,740
I...

6994
04:33:14,740 --> 04:33:15,580
Um...

6995
04:33:15,580 --> 04:33:17,020
Still working on it.

6996
04:33:19,100 --> 04:33:21,120
But she was like, where's Ice Monkey?

6997
04:33:21,440 --> 04:33:23,120
I was like, you don't even know this guy.

6998
04:33:23,400 --> 04:33:25,920
You don't even know Ice Monkey.

6999
04:33:26,500 --> 04:33:27,200
This is...

7000
04:33:27,200 --> 04:33:28,980
This is what I was working on earlier.

7001
04:33:31,740 --> 04:33:33,500
Oh, but she was playing and I was like...

7002
04:33:33,500 --> 04:33:35,580
Okay, I'm gonna take a break and I'm gonna play some...

7003
04:33:35,580 --> 04:33:37,240
I'm gonna play some bloons too.

7004
04:33:41,640 --> 04:33:43,460
Oh, so that's my...

7005
04:33:43,460 --> 04:33:44,700
That was my bloon setup.

7006
04:33:46,540 --> 04:33:48,500
I literally can't see anything.

7007
04:33:48,660 --> 04:33:50,100
And yeah, Ice Monkey is there.

7008
04:33:50,200 --> 04:33:51,200
She's like, where's Ice Monkey?

7009
04:33:51,300 --> 04:33:52,620
And I was like, he's chillin'.

7010
04:33:52,960 --> 04:33:54,120
He's chillin' up there!

7011
04:33:55,640 --> 04:33:57,880
0-0-0 Ice Monkey meta.

7012
04:33:58,660 --> 04:33:59,240
It's a...

7013
04:34:00,140 --> 04:34:01,720
I can't tell what's going on.

7014
04:34:01,900 --> 04:34:03,720
It's a bunch of boats and submarines.

7015
04:34:05,340 --> 04:34:05,820
Yeah.

7016
04:34:08,140 --> 04:34:10,520
It's a bunch of boats and submarines.

7017
04:34:11,060 --> 04:34:11,780
Pretty much.

7018
04:34:13,220 --> 04:34:13,700
Okay.

7019
04:34:14,500 --> 04:34:15,540
Thank you guys!

7020
04:34:15,820 --> 04:34:16,740
Have a good day.

7021
04:34:16,860 --> 04:34:17,200
Have a good night.

7022
04:34:17,200 --> 04:34:18,320
I'm getting so sleepy now.

7023
04:34:18,460 --> 04:34:20,320
So I'm gonna also go to sleep.

7024
04:34:21,380 --> 04:34:23,960
I'll see you guys when I see you...

7025
04:34:23,960 --> 04:34:25,140
Next time!

7026
04:34:25,620 --> 04:34:26,660
What's your next?

7027
04:34:27,100 --> 04:34:27,580
Otsumito!

7028
04:34:27,780 --> 04:34:28,080
Otsumito!

7029
04:34:28,760 --> 04:34:29,240
Otsumito!

7030
04:34:29,820 --> 04:34:30,180
Do I go?

7031
04:34:30,300 --> 04:34:30,740
Thank you!

7032
04:34:32,020 --> 04:34:34,020
May Sudoku stay far, far away.

7033
04:34:34,320 --> 04:34:34,580
Yeah!

7034
04:34:35,280 --> 04:34:35,580
Yeah!

7035
04:34:35,880 --> 04:34:38,420
I said, hey, why don't you give me the nonograms?

7036
04:34:38,420 --> 04:34:39,400
I love nonograms!

7037
04:34:39,480 --> 04:34:40,660
And then they're like...

7038
04:34:41,300 --> 04:34:41,980
Okay, fine.

7039
04:34:42,420 --> 04:34:44,540
We'll give you the nonograms.

7040
04:34:44,540 --> 04:34:46,100
And now we'll do it next time.

7041
04:34:46,320 --> 04:34:49,240
But I've never done a 15x15, so I'm kind of excited.

7042
04:34:50,320 --> 04:34:51,080
And scared.

7043
04:34:52,400 --> 04:34:53,420
We'll see how it goes.

7044
04:34:54,060 --> 04:34:54,460
Bye!

7045
04:34:55,320 --> 04:34:55,760
Oyasumi!

7046
04:34:57,540 --> 04:34:57,980
Oyasumito!

7047
04:34:59,040 --> 04:34:59,640
Bye-bye!

7048
04:34:59,940 --> 04:35:00,500
Thanks for watching!

7049
04:35:00,640 --> 04:35:01,600
Thanks for hanging out with me!

7050
04:35:02,200 --> 04:35:02,800
Bye-bye!

7051
04:35:02,920 --> 04:35:03,180
Bye-bye!

7052
04:35:03,780 --> 04:35:04,540
Bye-bye!
