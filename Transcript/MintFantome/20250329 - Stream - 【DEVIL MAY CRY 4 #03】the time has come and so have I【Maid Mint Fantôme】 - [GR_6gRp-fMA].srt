1
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,240
Oh wow oh wow oh wow...

2
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,440
Hello hello hello hello I forgot that it does this.

3
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,800
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

4
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,900
I blame you for my recent desire to play DMC4.

5
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,720
I've been playing hell and hell.

6
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,120
Good luck.

7
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,160
Thank you.

8
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,060
I need it today.

9
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,160
I need it today.

10
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,400
I guess I do.

11
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,060
I'm so... sleepy.

12
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,200
It's just like, thank you for the five gifts.

13
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,020
Thank you so much.

14
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,980
And just today you were the five gifts.

15
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,940
Thank you so much.

16
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,240
Dark Mint-chan.

17
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,020
Dark Mint-da.

18
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,560
Made licorice.

19
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,000
I felt like...

20
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,080
I felt like if I didn't look like the thumbnail, people would be like...

21
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,440
Scam!

22
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,260
Scam!

23
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,300
Scam!

24
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,680
I'm sorry if you're watching the VOD.

25
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,860
Sorry.

26
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,600
Oh gosh.

27
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,060
If you're watching the VOD...

28
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,080
This might not pertain to you so much, but...

29
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,540
I had to move the stream...

30
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,080
A couple hours because I so foolishly...

31
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,660
Scheduled... I had some voice recording stuff.

32
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,000
And if you call her stinky...

33
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,980
I see it, Ed.

34
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,860
I see it.

35
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,440
I was such a fool and I scheduled...

36
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,120
My voice recording stuff...

37
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,620
Well, okay.

38
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,160
I thought it was something else that I was scheduling.

39
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,880
And I was like, oh, that thing needs less time.

40
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,920
And I thought I scheduled the voice stuff for tomorrow.

41
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,900
But I didn't.

42
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,120
And... yeah, so...

43
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,120
We're here.

44
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,120
And I recorded and I'm...

45
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,600
So tired.

46
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,920
I might take Sunday off, you guys.

47
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,340
No, I won't.

48
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,220
It's just The Sims.

49
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,740
It's my favorite Friday from Mint's DMC.

50
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,700
The Friday.

51
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,540
Oh yeah, Evanescence.

52
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,700
I haven't watched the video though for Evanescence.

53
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,080
The new DMC anime, right?

54
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,380
And Evanescence does a song for it.

55
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,900
Saki, thanks for the gift!

56
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,120
Thank you.

57
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,540
My throat after recording... Oh, it actually hurts so much.

58
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,180
It actually hurts so much, but it's not because I...

59
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,540
You know, I talk all the time.

60
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,100
I stream all the time and everything.

61
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,380
But ever since... Ever since...

62
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,480
Spring!

63
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,260
And all the pollen!

64
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,020
It started, my throat started hurting in Japan from all the pollen.

65
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,260
Minky will be cringe again.

66
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,920
Yeah!

67
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,060
Why are calendars... Wait, why are calendars... Oh, I thought you were saying I will be cringe.

68
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,160
Why are calendars so lucky?

69
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,300
Because they have so many dates!

70
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,540
Offering for me to the Oracle of Tomodachi Life.

71
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,980
Looking forward to those dreams.

72
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,300
But yeah, ever since the pollen started coming out...

73
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,620
When I was in Japan, things started blooming.

74
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,600
And when I got back to my maid cafe, things were blooming and I was like...

75
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,440
So much pollen!

76
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,400
And it's stuck in my throat!

77
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,140
And so, it hurts a little bit.

78
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,340
But it's not because of recording.

79
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,960
The time has come and so has pollen.

80
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,700
I know.

81
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,500
Goth Minto.

82
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,180
Save me, Goth Minto.

83
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,780
So edgy.

84
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,920
Is this the first time you've had black hair?

85
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,440
No!

86
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,040
This is probably what I would look like if I were alive, maybe.

87
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,940
Probably, no?

88
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,320
Instead of white hair?

89
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,620
Probably.

90
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,480
I imagine.

91
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,780
We'll just pretend, right?

92
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,520
Maybe.

93
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,760
Today I'm cosplaying as a human being.

94
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,180
But Nero has white hair.

95
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,410
Maybe I should change.

96
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,290
No.

97
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:55,410
No.

98
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,150
Ok, then today is special.

99
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,290
Sorry, I'm feeling so...

100
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,450
Oh gosh, I can't stop yawning.

101
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,390
So sleepy.

102
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:19,310
It might be a bit of a shorter stream because I started later than I anticipated.

103
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,310
I'm so, so sorry.

104
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,450
But we'll have more Devil May Cry next week.

105
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:29,970
So, the schedule change worked perfectly for me because I had a work meeting at the original time.

106
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,810
Oh, O2 Revel!

107
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,850
It's ok, it's all good, thank you.

108
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,810
Thank you for understanding, everybody.

109
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,620
Severus, it's your birthday!

110
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,740
Alright, we'll sing happy birthday and then we'll start, yeah?

111
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,940
Happy birthday to you.

112
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,740
Happy birthday to you.

113
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,020
Happy birthday...

114
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,060
Oh no, there you are.

115
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,120
Oh dear, Severus.

116
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,260
Happy birthday to you.

117
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Happy birthday!

118
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Salken, thank you.

119
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,400
Alright, go again.

120
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,920
Thank you for the pig.

121
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,760
Thank you!

122
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
Take care of yourself.

123
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,780
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

124
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,520
So...

125
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,500
What was I going to say?

126
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,840
I don't know how much we'll get through today.

127
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,520
Who knows, maybe I'll have like a burst of energy in the middle.

128
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,680
But right now it's not looking very likely.

129
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,600
I can't stop, I'm sorry.

130
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,920
Contagious yawning, I know.

131
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,940
I know.

132
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,060
A lot of us are emotionally drained from yesterday.

133
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,160
I know.

134
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,720
People said that I streamed three times yesterday, but I consider it more like two streams.

135
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,080
Because it's like...

136
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,740
All I did was watch the direct.

137
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,160
Let's go back to this costume, since we did the other one before.

138
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,020
There is a black haired Dante, but we don't talk about him.

139
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,140
Dante?

140
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,240
Nero?

141
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,640
Gotta pay the QEI tech.

142
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,900
Don't say yawn.

143
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,360
I'll yawn.

144
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,640
Don't say lazy.

145
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:28,980
Mimped.

146
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:31,880
Okay.

147
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,020
Oh that's right, our girlfriend got stolen.

148
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,620
And...

149
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,020
We learned the devil form last time, which is great.

150
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,340
But time has come, it's over.

151
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:46,740
Bye.

152
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,360
Take care of yourself.

153
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,340
I will, I am.

154
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,540
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

155
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,440
I'm all good.

156
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,140
Oh, that was it.

157
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,020
Mission, wrapped in glory.

158
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,900
Find the ambitions of His Holiness.

159
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,600
What?

160
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,120
Are we gonna go get our girlfriend back?

161
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,940
Oh yeah.

162
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,560
Oh yeah.

163
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,960
Why?

164
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,500
Oh, this thing is like, got a little...

165
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,060
It's got a little...

166
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,780
I'm now addicted to bloons.

167
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,780
I can't get the monkeys off my mind.

168
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,100
Good.

169
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,720
Okay, these don't seem to do anything.

170
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,920
Do I fall in here?

171
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,360
Nope.

172
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,580
Alright, I guess we leave.

173
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,380
I'm finding the Holiness' ambitions.

174
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,380
Thank you.

175
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,640
That doesn't seem very good.

176
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:03,880
Oh!

177
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,960
Wiz, this is very... What is... What are you?

178
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,720
He's so calm, he's so cool.

179
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,040
He's so collected.

180
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,160
He doesn't care that his girlfriend just got stolen.

181
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,380
Thank you so much for the five.

182
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,120
He's like, yeah, I don't have time for witty yaps right now.

183
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,340
Oh shoot.

184
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,600
What?

185
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,900
Oh jeez.

186
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:54,980
Oh jeez.

187
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,240
Okay, and... Wait, double... Ah, there we go.

188
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,480
No!

189
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,520
Where are you going?

190
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,100
Nero!

191
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,150
Oh, they disappear and it's so frustrating.

192
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,490
This is a great time to remember how to play this game.

193
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,970
Did I just parry that?

194
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,090
Maybe I'm cracked.

195
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,590
Oh, I didn't parry that.

196
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,500
Ouch!

197
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,530
Come on!

198
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,630
Oh shoot.

199
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,100
Ouch!

200
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,050
Oh my gosh, why do you disappear?

201
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,930
Ah, ouch.

202
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,030
I tried dodging it.

203
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,710
I saw it coming.

204
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,570
I saw it coming!

205
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,990
I didn't see that one coming.

206
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,730
Wait, what did I forgore?

207
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,570
What do you mean I forgore?

208
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,010
Oh, snatch!

209
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,250
Oh my gosh, thank you.

210
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,610
I did forgo...

211
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,410
Ouch.

212
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,430
I totally forgore.

213
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,630
That's right!

214
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,130
These guys are the little...

215
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,690
Actually, I didn't recognize that they were those thingies.

216
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,630
Not gonna lie.

217
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,130
Wait, can you...

218
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,850
I didn't recognize it was the ugly lizards.

219
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,950
Yeah,

220
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,150
they look like little... I mean they are pretty ugly, no?

221
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,330
Where are you at?

222
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,310
Where did he go?

223
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,830
Come here!

224
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,530
Where did he go?

225
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,970
Oh, I got him!

226
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,650
Where did you go?

227
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,730
He's...he's...he's dead!

228
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,330
Whoa!

229
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:55,150
I always told myself I'd send her red when she max exceed or SSS, whichever came first.

230
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,790
Thank you for all the wonderful DFC streams.

231
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,970
Hope you know you're super smug and sexy.

232
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,670
And you always max exceed our expectations.

233
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,230
Also, sword, trick, gun, royal guard!

234
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,090
Thank you!

235
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,430
We got a puzzle.

236
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,830
I'm super smug and sexy, really.

237
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,210
Oh shoot, it's this thing again.

238
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,690
I'm running.

239
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,330
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

240
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,990
Wait, I'm gonna...I'm gonna miss it.

241
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,590
Oh, she used the camera.

242
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,910
Wait, hold on.

243
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,970
Can I have...Oh, ouch.

244
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,270
Um...

245
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,350
Can we do that again?

246
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:53,810
Uh-oh.

247
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,530
Am I...am I locked?

248
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,370
Wait.

249
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,250
What was the camera?

250
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,350
Yeah, exactly!

251
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,090
Uh...uh...

252
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:04,770
Uh...

253
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,400
Little turn.

254
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,360
Thank you.

255
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,380
To the right?

256
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,920
What do you mean to the right?

257
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Is there one right here?

258
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:37,800
No.

259
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,580
Time to go back.

260
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,740
I have to cross through again though.

261
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,960
I guess it's...

262
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:54,610
OK.

263
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,010
Alright, let's not get hit.

264
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,510
There we go.

265
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,610
I made it.

266
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,530
Somehow.

267
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,690
Ta-da!

268
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,730
Wow, cool puzzle.

269
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,910
Wow, cool puzzle.

270
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,940
I sure hope I didn't need anything up there.

271
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,180
By your hand you cannot break our clasp.

272
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,500
Stop.

273
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,180
Stop.

274
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,780
Oh, um...

275
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,120
Oh!

276
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,800
I forgot.

277
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,700
I was like, how do I activate it?

278
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,780
I was like, do I...

279
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:00,980
Hmm...

280
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,240
I know there was some like blorbs and stuff up there.

281
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,120
I guess we missed it.

282
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,000
I guess I missed it.

283
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,500
So sad.

284
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,580
But we got some rorbs.

285
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,820
I'll take it.

286
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:19,820
Oh!

287
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,360
Wait, I can recall it though.

288
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,980
Should I do... Wait, will I have to fight everything all over again?

289
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,660
No.

290
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,280
Wait.

291
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,080
I thought I saw a door.

292
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,120
Maybe.

293
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,940
I think I just locked myself in.

294
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,540
Oh!

295
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,260
No!

296
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,380
No!

297
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:50,900
No!

298
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:51,940
No,

299
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,870
please.

300
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:00,790
Nero.

301
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,890
Straight.

302
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,910
Straight.

303
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,470
Straight.

304
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,670
Please!

305
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,860
Yeah, but like, can I get back down?

306
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,940
Do I have to go all the way back to the top?

307
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,100
Oh!

308
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:20,880
Jeez.

309
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,640
Don't make me...

310
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,980
I'm doing all this for nothing, aren't I?

311
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,260
Oh wait, no.

312
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,740
It's right here.

313
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,100
I can dive back down.

314
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,740
But I want the... I want that blorb.

315
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,500
I want this.

316
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,140
How do I get to it?

317
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,460
Thank you so much for the 20 gets.

318
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,240
Thank you!

319
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

320
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,830
How many blorb slots do I have anyway?

321
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,890
I have one out of four.

322
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,800
It is a mystery.

323
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,180
He's right there within my grasp, but actually not really.

324
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,240
Just barely within my grasp.

325
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,160
If I go in here...

326
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,520
If I go in there, we'll go up.

327
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,320
Turn like a bit to the right.

328
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,680
I give up.

329
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,540
Onwards.

330
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh, it's these guys again.

331
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,920
How did I make it through?

332
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,560
You... you ass!

333
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,220
Oh no.

334
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:08,980
Gosh!

335
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,000
Run!

336
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,620
OK, they're all gonna jump at me.

337
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,180
Jump at me!

338
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,200
Come here!

339
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,920
Again?

340
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:32,340
Again?

341
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:32,940
Again?

342
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,440
Again?

343
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,550
Oh my gosh.

344
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:42,630
Wow!

345
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:43,870
Ouch!

346
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:44,770
Oh my gosh.

347
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,550
You guys are gonna die!

348
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:04,730
Ouch!

349
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,110
Ouch!

350
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:05,650
No!

351
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:05,830
No!

352
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:05,970
No!

353
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,120
Same time.

354
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,740
How romantic.

355
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,070
Oh, not run.

356
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:48,090
I can't tell if I'm going the correct way, but...

357
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,330
I can't think of another way I gotta go.

358
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,310
Oh, that's right.

359
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,610
We came from the lasers.

360
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,810
Did I do this one?

361
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,550
I thought I did.

362
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,060
I do respawn.

363
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,020
Oh, do I get more stuff?

364
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,100
I'm gonna try it anyway.

365
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,280
It's good practice, no?

366
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,640
Yeah,

367
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:09,980
yeah.

368
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,340
No reason not to get paid.

369
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,180
Pretty much, no?

370
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,060
Was there anything else on this side?

371
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,920
You're holy.

372
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,560
Oh, that's right.

373
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,480
Oh wait, what's here?

374
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,360
Hello?

375
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,880
More money.

376
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,920
OK.

377
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,840
Alright, we're gonna go through.

378
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,780
I'm gonna make it.

379
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,780
And I'm also gonna get paid while I do it.

380
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah, baby.

381
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,100
Yeah, baby.

382
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,140
Oh, that was so close.

383
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,160
Yeah, baby.

384
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,100
Yeah, baby.

385
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,160
Yeah, baby.

386
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,480
That's right.

387
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,500
We open this up.

388
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,040
Oh, cinematic.

389
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,280
Happy...Celibacy week?

390
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:17,900
Today is my birthday!

391
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,140
Is that...Jesus Christ?

392
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,780
Your name is cut off though.

393
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,280
Can I get a birthday song?

394
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:26,940
The hell?

395
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,640
Isn't that Christmas?

396
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,500
Happy Demon Hunting Winter.

397
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,440
Thank you for the...

398
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,300
Thank you so much for the 500.

399
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,140
Thank you.

400
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,060
It's Christmas.

401
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,240
Happy birthday to you.

402
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,180
Happy birthday to you.

403
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,200
Happy birthday, Jesus Christ.

404
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,100
Happy birthday to you.

405
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,960
Happy birthday.

406
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,480
OK,

407
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,340
I don't like that.

408
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,990
I hate chairs.

409
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,010
I hate chairs.

410
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,670
Alright.

411
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,770
This looks so awful.

412
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,490
Excuse me?

413
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,670
I'm gonna wait for it to reset.

414
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,030
Oh, nice.

415
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,830
This is a fun room.

416
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,930
Fun is subjective, no?

417
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,690
Oh, this actually lasts a long time.

418
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,170
OK, good.

419
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,550
It will stop though, right?

420
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,350
Eventually?

421
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,430
I was just gonna wait for it to reset.

422
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,390
Wow.

423
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,510
How long is this room?

424
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,230
I guess I'll go.

425
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,850
And really regret it.

426
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,170
I think I'm gonna die here.

427
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:06,530
No?

428
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,710
If I go and it resets in the middle, I'm definitely gonna die.

429
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,280
OK, I'm just gonna go.

430
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:23,860
Ouch!

431
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,600
Ouch you!

432
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,660
Ouch you!

433
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,400
OK.

434
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,300
Ouch you!

435
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,300
Oh!

436
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,320
Oh!

437
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,240
Oh!

438
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,100
Wait, what's glowing?

439
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,020
Why is it glowing?

440
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,200
Oh, there is a secret here.

441
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,400
What's the secret mission?

442
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,880
First try, baby.

443
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,480
First try.

444
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,280
Vermifuge.

445
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,680
Eliminate all the Chimera before the Scarecrow was taken over.

446
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,170
I think I'm OK.

447
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,130
This one.

448
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,310
Is this mission.

449
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,930
It's a bodyguard mission?

450
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,730
Screw this mission.

451
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:20,070
I think right now, if I were in a better head space, maybe...

452
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,590
Oh my goodness.

453
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,050
If I were better in... Wait, what?

454
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,820
Oh, it's down there.

455
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,420
Wow, that's so rude.

456
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,460
They force you.

457
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:37,820
No!

458
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,740
Wise choice.

459
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,040
Oh, you!

460
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:45,860
Come here.

461
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:46,720
Come here.

462
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,460
Come here.

463
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,000
Come here.

464
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,440
He's not even gonna let it get up.

465
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,980
There we go.

466
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,620
Where are you?

467
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,280
Don't

468
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,780
even get up.

469
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,500
Don't even try.

470
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,540
Don't even...

471
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,620
You will never see the light of day ever again.

472
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,220
I will not let you even get a single breath.

473
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,240
Ouch.

474
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,250
We're back?

475
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:39,490
OK.

476
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,410
Did you guys see how... Did you guys see him just funny run at me?

477
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,030
It was so funny.

478
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,270
Ouch.

479
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,130
Ouch.

480
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,090
Ouch.

481
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,790
Shall we dance?

482
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,750
Nice.

483
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,750
Can I please hit you?

484
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,470
What happened?

485
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,610
No, so unfair.

486
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,490
Please.

487
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,530
Ouch.

488
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:21,890
Ouch.

489
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:22,890
Ouch.

490
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,750
I hate this guy.

491
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,910
I can't grab him.

492
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,910
At least I don't think I can.

493
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,800
I don't wanna get too far though, because he starts getting crazy.

494
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,900
You can?

495
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,100
Maybe a ton of times?

496
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,040
Oh, I see him.

497
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,300
He's becoming naked.

498
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,640
He's becoming naked.

499
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,980
He's losing his clothes.

500
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,560
Oh my god.

501
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,280
You guys, I think I'm gonna die.

502
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,640
I think I'm gonna die for real.

503
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,960
Oh shit, shit, shit, shit.

504
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:14,980
Oh god.

505
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,740
Oh god, I'm gonna die.

506
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,300
I'm gonna die.

507
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:19,560
Ah!

508
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,210
Where will I start from I wonder.

509
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,030
Abandon all hope.

510
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,390
Oh from here is not so bad maybe.

511
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,170
It's not so bad maybe from here.

512
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,060
Oh, oh jeez.

513
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,640
Don't, don't look.

514
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,920
Don't look.

515
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,660
Don't look.

516
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,660
Don't look.

517
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,450
Did you guys see that?

518
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,230
That was crazy at the end.

519
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,030
That was crazy at the end.

520
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,910
Sorry I wasn't looking.

521
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,750
Good, good, good, good.

522
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,270
Nero Snatch couldn't get his clothes off fast enough.

523
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:31,250
Become naked, naked, naked, naked, naked.

524
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,610
I'm gonna do the same exact thing I did before.

525
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,350
Oh wait, no, no, no.

526
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,790
That's not the same exact thing.

527
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,570
I wanted to put them in the corner.

528
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,690
Yeah, there we go.

529
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,690
Rorbs be damned I guess.

530
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,570
Killing is more important.

531
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,790
You're close.

532
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,370
Yeah, that's right.

533
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,670
It's someone's birthday.

534
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,430
I will have to say happy birthday.

535
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,810
Just remind me.

536
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,210
I tried to dodge.

537
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,830
If I, if I snatch while, while I'm in.

538
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,130
Oh, there we go.

539
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,280
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

540
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,070
Oh, we did big damage though.

541
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,870
That was too slow.

542
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:58,550
Taking your clothes, taking your clothes.

543
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,570
You're naked, you're naked.

544
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,140
When you get the chance, could you please wish my friend Jack a happy birthday?

545
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,440
We love you, PewDiePie.

546
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Thank you, Ellie.

547
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,960
Of course I can wish Jack a happy birthday.

548
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,860
Jack, happy birthday.

549
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,680
Happy birthday to you.

550
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,560
Happy birthday to you.

551
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,600
Happy birthday dear Jack.

552
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,920
Happy birthday to you.

553
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,300
Happy birthday.

554
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,280
Okey dokey.

555
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:54,380
There is nothing else, so let's attempt this.

556
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,500
Oh, the key of Kronos is beginning to vibrate in resonance with the machine.

557
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,220
You use the key of Kronos.

558
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,080
Okay.

559
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,500
The time has come, so have I.

560
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,700
Wait, do I have to get back up?

561
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,100
Wait, that's a different door.

562
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,460
Okay.

563
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,580
Okay, we can...we'll be able to do this.

564
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,580
Surely.

565
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,440
Wait, where is the next one?

566
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,300
Can I get there?

567
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,600
Alright Nero, I'm going to need you to use your arms, buddy.

568
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,400
Oh gosh, okay.

569
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,680
So far so good.

570
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,020
Okay, there we go.

571
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,440
Oh, it's just a staircase.

572
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,580
Oh...

573
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,020
Okay, we got this.

574
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,280
This time for sure.

575
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,140
Is it this door?

576
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,000
Please, no Nero!

577
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,420
I'm just going to wait.

578
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,280
I'm just going to wait.

579
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,540
Again, again!

580
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,100
Come here.

581
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,360
You're not allowed to rest.

582
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,520
I won't let you.

583
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,200
Please, Nero, please!

584
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,920
I won't mind if my birthday comes.

585
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,080
When your birthday is here, I will sing you happy birthday.

586
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,880
That's how it works.

587
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,840
Why am I so bad at this?

588
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,200
Are you going to try the other character playthroughs?

589
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,780
I'm not sure yet.

590
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,560
Wait, where is it?

591
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,220
Where is the thingy?

592
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,040
Oh, there it is.

593
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,260
Okay.

594
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,740
I'm not sure.

595
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,300
I think it might depend on how...

596
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,600
I feel.

597
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,340
Nice, nice!

598
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,180
We got it!

599
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
O, U.

600
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,840
Oh, U, W.

601
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,920
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

602
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,620
And smash him, smash him, smash him, smash him.

603
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,500
Grab him, grab him, grab him, smash him, grab him.

604
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,160
Grab your shield, grab your shield.

605
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,020
Come here.

606
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,760
Come here.

607
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,200
Stupid.

608
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,720
Come here, come here.

609
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,900
You missed your birthday 9.

610
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,620
How could you?

611
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,800
Oh, another?

612
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:31,860
Another?

613
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,010
I'll grab these in a second.

614
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:40,970
Oh, there's two more?

615
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,650
Where did you come from?

616
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,960
No, my rorbs!

617
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:54,970
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

618
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,520
No, my rorbs!

619
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,420
Wait, what happened?

620
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,040
Why did it break?

621
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,920
Why did it break?

622
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,720
It didn't count?

623
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,920
It's so sad.

624
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,660
Ladies, ladies.

625
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,160
It's time from the first hit.

626
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,580
I didn't mean to hit it the first time I did.

627
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,840
My birthday is on April 1st.

628
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,140
My mom's April Fool.

629
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,360
Is that what she called you growing up?

630
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,100
Your mommy's little April Fool.

631
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,640
What is this?

632
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,800
Oh, the winged talisman is beginning to vibrate in resonance with the machine.

633
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,760
You used the winged talisman.

634
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,960
I'm already missing it.

635
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,380
I want to have another one.

636
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:07,840
Blorb!

637
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,740
I saw it.

638
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,300
Wait, go back down.

639
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,380
Go down, go down!

640
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,900
The blorb!

641
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,760
I saw it.

642
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,540
I'm greedy, please.

643
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,840
I'm so greedy.

644
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,440
Down, down.

645
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:26,840
No going back?

646
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,900
How are you even supposed to know it's there?

647
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,740
How are you even supposed to know?

648
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,420
Ladies, ladies.

649
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,720
Anything over here?

650
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:42,720
Nothing?

651
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,140
OK.

652
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,340
This isn't a door, right?

653
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,160
Gotta replay the whole game.

654
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,920
Meeting room.

655
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,060
This looks like a boss room, no?

656
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,210
Two of you!

657
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,400
No, no!

658
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:13,800
Come

659
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:26,330
here.

660
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,050
Oh, damn.

661
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,010
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

662
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,400
I saw your shadow.

663
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,800
I don't think I can...

664
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,800
Well, I was...

665
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,060
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

666
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,860
Can I do it when I'm in Mega 4?

667
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:05,380
Oh, no.

668
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,000
Maybe?

669
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,200
There

670
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:30,350
we go.

671
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:32,170
Oh my goodness.

672
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:42,590
You should have a preliminary sense of where all the blorbs are.

673
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,210
I'm a failure!

674
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,930
Chair, chair, chair.

675
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,230
Nice!

676
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:58,330
Glorb.

677
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,410
Delicious, delicious, delicious glorb.

678
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:03,030
Oishii!

679
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:03,330
Wait.

680
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,530
This looks pretty ominous, no?

681
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,670
Is this about to be a boss battle?

682
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,030
Those were Herman Miller!

683
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,130
What's this one?

684
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:17,030
Secret mission.

685
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,850
Free running.

686
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,430
Reach the goal without falling through the vanishing floor.

687
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:21,310
No.

688
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,790
How about...no.

689
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:30,150
How about...no.

690
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:34,990
How about...no.

691
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,980
What was it that I was saving up for, I wonder?

692
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,680
When Devil Trigger is active, press...

693
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,380
Y, B.

694
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:04,830
The one you cheesed, but this time you cannot cheese.

695
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,390
Exactly, so I will not try.

696
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:13,630
What are they doing?

697
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,070
Kissing?

698
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,970
I could also...whoops, not Devil Trigger.

699
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:22,370
I could also start doing charge shot.

700
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,370
I could maybe get all of charge shot.

701
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,570
Encounter the night guys by timing your busters.

702
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,390
They're about to attack, but it's pretty difficult.

703
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:34,670
I see.

704
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:35,810
Thank you, thank you.

705
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,050
Don't they kind of look like they're kissing?

706
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,240
Maybe not.

707
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,260
Maybe my own delusions.

708
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,440
I think my delusions are happening.

709
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,740
I've never used that one.

710
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,520
I tried using that one and I'm so bad at it.

711
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:56,720
Split.

712
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,200
Mid-air, press R, B, forward.

713
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,520
I think you're kissing wrong.

714
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,580
Oh my gosh, wait!

715
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,960
Just some guy with a mustache.

716
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,320
I saw you.

717
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,660
I saw your comment.

718
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,600
Where were you?

719
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,580
I think it was on the Tomodachi Life trailer...

720
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,520
Video that Nintendo posted.

721
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,800
And I was like, hey!

722
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,100
I know that guy!

723
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,340
He's everywhere!

724
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,200
He gets around all the chats?

725
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,500
Are you that famous?

726
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,880
All the comments were like that too.

727
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,580
They were like, oh my gosh, I've seen this guy before.

728
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,800
My Nerissa guys, wait.

729
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:54,600
Stop.

730
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,420
I wish I was half as beautiful as her.

731
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,480
He's everywhere.

732
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,100
My secret's out.

733
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,620
I was like, hey!

734
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,560
I know that guy!

735
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:19,240
It's always funny when I see people in chat that I recognize in other places and I'm like...

736
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,020
Sometimes I'll see you in other VTuber chats.

737
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,460
But that would never be you, right?

738
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,540
You know?

739
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,140
I met a fellow Wisp today.

740
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,740
Wisp, you know who you are.

741
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,000
I cheat on you all the time?

742
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,860
Why would you tell me this?

743
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,740
Yeah, I only mean to...

744
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,060
Thank god you never watch Twitch.

745
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,880
I do watch Twitch, I just don't chat.

746
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,500
I watch a bunch of streams.

747
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,680
Well, not a bunch, but I watch streams.

748
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,140
I just don't chat.

749
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,060
And then Kiara gets upset at me for it, so I try to chat.

750
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,280
But then sometimes I don't chat.

751
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,520
Don't tell her.

752
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,980
Don't tell her that I watch her streams and don't chat.

753
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,560
I dread the days Miki discovers my AMVs?

754
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,940
I'm a lurker.

755
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,360
I'm just a lurker, okay?

756
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,800
I'm just a lurker.

757
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,460
Let me lurk.

758
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,580
Let me just...

759
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,780
Let me be unnoticed.

760
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,400
I'm just haunting, okay?

761
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,240
Gosh.

762
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,100
Let me just lurk.

763
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,280
Okay, we won't tell her.

764
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,460
I don't trust you at all, Spank.

765
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,320
I don't trust you at all.

766
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,140
I'm mostly a lurker too.

767
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,580
Lurking is fine.

768
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,220
Hello lurkers.

769
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,720
Hello everybody lurking watching.

770
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:54,260
Hello.

771
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,100
Hello, hello.

772
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,800
Speaking of Kiara, when's your RTX stream?

773
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,700
You know, I tried it.

774
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,380
I tried making one of me.

775
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,360
And I was like, I don't think this looks good.

776
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,640
So I just...

777
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,060
I was like, I can't make it look like me at all.

778
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,740
I couldn't make it look like me at all.

779
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,200
I have been summoned.

780
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:28,770
Guys, it's my first stream here.

781
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:29,750
Shut up, Evan.

782
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:31,390
It's not your first stream.

783
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:34,890
Shut up.

784
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:39,310
Okay, anyway.

785
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:40,710
Abilities?

786
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:41,650
Are there any abilities?

787
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:43,670
What's a table hopper?

788
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,610
Just before an attack hits, press R.

789
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:46,550
Oh, sideways.

790
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:48,290
I never press sideways.

791
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:53,010
After executing a table hopper, press R.

792
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:53,830
Oh my gosh.

793
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:56,450
You just dance around with them.

794
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:00,350
After executing a table hopper 2.

795
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,270
Wait, this is so confusing.

796
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,570
Press LT just after an attack.

797
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,680
Wouldn't that activate my devil trigger?

798
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,880
Your timing must be absolutely perfect.

799
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,000
Get more orbs.

800
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,200
That's huge.

801
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,440
Enemy step.

802
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,520
I love this one.

803
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,360
Pull my mental trigger.

804
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,140
Oh, LT.

805
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,180
Not LB.

806
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:36,820
Oh, you're right.

807
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,580
Press LT just after an attack.

808
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,100
Oh, I see.

809
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:45,380
I see.

810
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:45,780
I see.

811
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,100
I see.

812
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:46,480
I see.

813
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,780
Oh yeah, because there is a gauge.

814
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,700
It's the rev thing.

815
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,320
What if I try my gun?

816
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,300
I'm going to try it.

817
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:56,840
We can always...

818
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,280
No, not you.

819
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,980
We can always refund.

820
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:05,860
Oh my bad.

821
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,280
There we go.

822
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,600
It's time for big charge action.

823
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,940
It's just range of orb collection.

824
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:30,680
It's a scam.

825
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:31,660
No.

826
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,420
It's real to me.

827
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,240
OK

828
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,080
I know there is going to be a boss in there.

829
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,320
Your holiness?

830
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:57,380
Oh Dante!

831
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,460
Your holiness?

832
00:53:59,460 --> 00:53:59,980
Your holiness?

833
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,620
It was like a little tap.

834
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,380
No, my rubbing sword.

835
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,860
My stand has words to say about that.

836
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,220
Oh, our sword that we just got.

837
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,800
Return it to me.

838
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,680
And I'll let you go, kid.

839
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,800
I want to see his ass turn pink.

840
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,620
Oh my god.

841
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:54,900
He is so calm.

842
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:03,150
Wait, Dante.

843
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:04,830
I don't want to fight you.

844
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:07,430
Oh shit.

845
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:08,410
I have to fight Dante.

846
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:20,100
Oh, he is

847
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:24,960
too fast.

848
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:26,980
Oh my god.

849
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:27,620
He is too fast.

850
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:31,760
Ouch.

851
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:35,020
Oh my god.

852
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,140
Dante, please.

853
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:37,860
Don't.

854
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:38,860
Don't.

855
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,340
Dante, that's my move.

856
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:40,780
Please.

857
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,320
Oh my god.

858
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:44,920
He is so good.

859
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,100
He is so good.

860
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,260
Holy shit.

861
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,270
Oh my god.

862
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,530
He is parrying my bullets.

863
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,670
Where are my bullets?

864
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,210
How are you so fast?

865
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,430
Oh my god.

866
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:13,240
Now I learned what to do.

867
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:14,500
No.

868
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,900
How are you dodging so fast?

869
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,340
Oh

870
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:34,750
my god.

871
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:35,510
Stop it.

872
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:36,910
Stop it.

873
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:38,830
He is gobbling.

874
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,970
Here we go.

875
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:48,930
Grab you.

876
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,310
Grab you.

877
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:56,110
Oh shit.

878
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:58,950
We grabbed him.

879
00:56:59,010 --> 00:56:59,610
We grabbed him.

880
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,380
This is too much.

881
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,620
Ouch.

882
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,220
I

883
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:33,550
think I can do this.

884
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:35,410
Damn.

885
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:36,270
He dodged.

886
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,780
Oh my god.

887
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,160
Where are my...

888
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,410
Trickster.

889
00:57:56,370 --> 00:58:08,570
Holy shit.

890
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:14,780
Ouch.

891
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:14,900
Ouch.

892
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:15,160
Ouch.

893
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,540
Come on.

894
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:19,940
Come on.

895
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:20,240
Come on.

896
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:20,800
Come on.

897
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:25,610
Ouch.

898
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:26,030
Ouch.

899
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:26,310
Ouch.

900
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:26,990
Ouch.

901
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,280
Ouch.

902
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:33,520
Ouch.

903
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,340
Please let me out.

904
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,020
I want off this wild ride.

905
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:43,900
Jesus.

906
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,900
The camera angle scared me.

907
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,540
We are so dead.

908
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,100
We are so dead.

909
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,900
Please let me out.

910
00:58:58,950 --> 00:58:59,970
Oh shit.

911
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:00,710
Please.

912
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:01,450
I can't see anything.

913
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:02,690
I can't see anything.

914
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:04,290
Oh my god.

915
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:04,670
No.

916
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:04,970
Stop.

917
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:05,310
Please.

918
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,910
I wonder if I have any.

919
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:15,090
I have an M-Star.

920
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,960
I have an M-Star.

921
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:31,690
It's a fun fight.

922
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,550
It's not bad at all.

923
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:36,190
It's fun for real.

924
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:39,070
Let's try it one more time.

925
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:41,010
Let's try it one more time and see.

926
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:48,890
Oh damn.

927
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:49,050
Damn.

928
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:49,050
Damn.

929
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:05,130
We were so close.

930
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,230
We were so close.

931
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,810
That wasn't bad.

932
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,070
For a first try.

933
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,350
OK.

934
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,310
Let's go.

935
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:30,630
I'm here.

936
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:32,910
Oh god.

937
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:34,690
He keeps spamming this move.

938
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:37,730
Don't say no.

939
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:38,830
Don't say no.

940
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:44,670
Oh my god.

941
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,600
He is so dirty.

942
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:00,900
Ouch.

943
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,000
How do you get out of that?

944
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,060
It hurts so bad.

945
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:22,310
Oh my god.

946
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,150
He always gets me back.

947
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:26,650
He always gets me back.

948
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:27,110
Too good.

949
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:33,860
Please grab him.

950
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,160
Grab him.

951
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:34,560
Grab him.

952
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,020
Grab him.

953
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,820
I'm doing way worse this time than before.

954
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,300
Dante.

955
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,980
I think I'm ready to give up.

956
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,900
Just kill me.

957
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:16,960
Just kill me Dante.

958
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,080
Just kill me.

959
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,320
Just kill me.

960
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,160
Just kill me.

961
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,040
I wasn't feeling it.

962
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,540
Just kill me.

963
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,560
Just kill me.

964
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:35,490
I can totally see with this camera.

965
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:38,770
Alright.

966
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,010
For real this time.

967
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:41,890
For real this time.

968
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,490
Let me get some water.

969
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:01,310
Complete lack of motivation.

970
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:04,770
I even have a sword.

971
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:07,190
Where is your motivation?

972
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:11,890
Where is your motivation?

973
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:14,990
You are scaring me Dante.

974
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:16,450
You are scaring me.

975
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,520
Why do you got to get me like that?

976
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,400
Stop spamming that.

977
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,140
Are you about to do that?

978
01:03:59,360 --> 01:03:59,960
No?

979
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:00,680
OK.

980
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,820
I hide.

981
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,560
Shoot!

982
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,080
No!

983
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,220
No shoot!

984
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,580
No shoot!

985
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,800
Oh my goodness.

986
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:32,160
Come here Dante.

987
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:32,640
Come here.

988
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,660
Shall we dance?

989
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:55,330
What's the point?

990
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:56,770
I can't even get a hit in.

991
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:58,170
Oh shoot.

992
01:04:58,530 --> 01:04:58,930
Please.

993
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,730
What's the point if I can't get a hit in?

994
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:03,970
This sucks.

995
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,530
Oh that sucks.

996
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:06,830
Oh that really sucks.

997
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:08,610
Oh that really, really sucks.

998
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:10,690
Oh that really, really sucks.

999
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:12,010
That really, really sucks.

1000
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:17,270
Is there more heal?

1001
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:23,210
Don't do it.

1002
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:23,990
Don't you dare.

1003
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:27,030
OK.

1004
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,370
I'm gonna heal my DT.

1005
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:31,890
Oh he is too far away for DT.

1006
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,300
How did I get so close?

1007
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:45,600
Beginner's luck I guess.

1008
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,380
Holy moly.

1009
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,780
No, no, no.

1010
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:56,360
You

1011
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,620
gotta get out of it.

1012
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:03,920
You gotta get out of it.

1013
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,200
He stingered me and I didn't even stinger him.

1014
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,420
That's messed up.

1015
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:20,810
Don't, don't, don't you dare.

1016
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:21,970
Don't you...

1017
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:25,070
What?

1018
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:26,930
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1019
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,230
I thought I was behind the pole.

1020
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,850
The way he runs at me scares me.

1021
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:34,810
He's got like a craze.

1022
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:35,650
Look at his eye.

1023
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,240
I can't read him at all.

1024
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,860
I can't read him at all.

1025
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,520
I'm so bad.

1026
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,650
Dante's ranking looks like during this fight.

1027
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:26,390
What pots?

1028
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:27,050
Are these pots?

1029
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:29,250
No, it's worms.

1030
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:34,190
Stay away from me Dante, you crazy man.

1031
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:36,150
Stop it.

1032
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:37,350
Don't follow me.

1033
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:38,610
Dante don't follow me.

1034
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:39,610
You are insane.

1035
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:41,190
You are insane.

1036
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:41,950
Dante!

1037
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:49,650
He is chasing me.

1038
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:51,310
He is such a freak.

1039
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:53,090
OK.

1040
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:54,270
Alright, alright.

1041
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:54,690
Come here.

1042
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:56,710
After you do your little thing.

1043
01:07:59,330 --> 01:07:59,750
OK.

1044
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:00,130
Come here.

1045
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:00,710
Come here.

1046
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,600
Oh shoot.

1047
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,300
Oh shoot.

1048
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,320
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1049
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,020
I even grabbed him.

1050
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:19,800
I even grabbed him.

1051
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,460
Why did I run?

1052
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:22,480
He taunted me.

1053
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:23,720
Stop doing that.

1054
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,160
Don't do that.

1055
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:24,920
That's weird.

1056
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:25,760
Don't do that.

1057
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,120
Dante, don't do that.

1058
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,420
I don't like that.

1059
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,600
What did you say?

1060
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:31,780
What did you say grandpa?

1061
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,000
Oh shoot.

1062
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,460
Oh no.

1063
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:40,880
That's so unfair.

1064
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:42,460
Dante.

1065
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,520
Excuse me.

1066
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,160
What are you doing?

1067
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:50,840
What is that?

1068
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,160
Ouch.

1069
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,320
I parried him though.

1070
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,480
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1071
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:21,460
He is styling on me.

1072
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,320
Ouch.

1073
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,060
Yeah, you missed.

1074
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,320
Oh nevermind.

1075
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,220
You didn't miss.

1076
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:35,400
I missed.

1077
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,380
And that's it.

1078
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,500
I should have healed the first time you guys.

1079
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:49,620
Why?

1080
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,460
I was such an idiot.

1081
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,760
I should have healed.

1082
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,420
I should have healed the first time.

1083
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,020
Oh my god.

1084
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,520
I should have healed the first time.

1085
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,260
I'm such an idiot.

1086
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,640
Oh, I'm so stupid.

1087
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,240
I'm so stupid.

1088
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:06,480
I'm so stupid.

1089
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,240
I think

1090
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,160
I had literal beginner's luck.

1091
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:38,850
Shooting is the key here.

1092
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,220
Shooting is the key here.

1093
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:47,380
Damn.

1094
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:49,680
Ouch, ouch.

1095
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,240
He got me first.

1096
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:50,880
He got me first.

1097
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:50,940
Ouch.

1098
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:58,870
It really isn't.

1099
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:00,930
Ok, well, it is for me, ok?

1100
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,440
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1101
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,700
It like kind of stuns lock him.

1102
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,740
Stun locks him, you know?

1103
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,240
And so, I can kind of like get him where I need to be.

1104
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,460
See?

1105
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,060
It's working for me.

1106
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:31,960
It's working for me!

1107
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,480
Ouch, ouch, ouch, no.

1108
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:34,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1109
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,700
That was so sick, though.

1110
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:44,900
Ouch.

1111
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:06,920
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1112
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:12,860
I need to get away from him.

1113
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:18,480
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1114
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:19,980
Ouch.

1115
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,020
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, hold on.

1116
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,070
What are you doing?

1117
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,060
Oh shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1118
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:43,900
No!

1119
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,460
Don't stinger, please.

1120
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:56,880
Don't stinger.

1121
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:00,660
No, no, no, no.

1122
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:08,580
It's so loud in my ears.

1123
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,210
What did you do just now?

1124
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:17,290
Oh shoot.

1125
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:24,170
That was close.

1126
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:36,740
Ouch.

1127
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:38,000
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

1128
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:07,660
Oh shoot.

1129
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,020
No, he got me first.

1130
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,430
I might heal, guys.

1131
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:16,030
I might.

1132
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,240
I love DMC2, baby.

1133
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:46,630
Holy cow, Alante.

1134
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:47,710
Where did you learn that?

1135
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:50,330
Definitely not from me.

1136
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:50,950
Ouch.

1137
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:52,170
Oh no, no, no.

1138
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:53,750
Oh no, no, no, no.

1139
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:06,930
Should I heal?

1140
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,360
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1141
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,950
One HP in a dream.

1142
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:45,390
I think I'm gonna use it.

1143
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:52,330
I'm gonna use it.

1144
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:53,210
Okay, doctor.

1145
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:54,770
Alright.

1146
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:55,750
Oh.

1147
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:57,090
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1148
01:15:57,870 --> 01:16:00,430
I don't like it.

1149
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,460
I'm gonna waste my DT.

1150
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:08,740
I'm gonna waste my DT reel.

1151
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,120
I'm gonna waste my DT reel.

1152
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,240
What a waste.

1153
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,180
No, my DT.

1154
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:16,280
DT.

1155
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:25,750
You're so close.

1156
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:26,990
Oh my god.

1157
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:27,350
Oh my god.

1158
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:27,730
Oh my god.

1159
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:30,290
He's so close.

1160
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:32,330
He's so stinking close.

1161
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:48,010
DMC2.

1162
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,310
Hey, if it works, it works.

1163
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:54,230
My methods may be unconventional, but...

1164
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:58,370
But if it works for me, it works.

1165
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:11,450
I need water back.

1166
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:24,090
It's gotta stay in the family.

1167
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:25,190
The family.

1168
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:26,370
Wait, then where's Virgil?

1169
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:27,930
I need this.

1170
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:31,350
I need...

1171
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:32,690
Save your girlfriend.

1172
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:35,150
No one can stop her to join.

1173
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:36,290
Thank you.

1174
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,500
Now that you're calm and cool...

1175
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,380
Get going.

1176
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,780
I killed him in DMC1.

1177
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,800
Oh, the timeline.

1178
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:54,300
You're right.

1179
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:00,300
Hey.

1180
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,360
What's your name?

1181
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:06,400
Nero.

1182
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:08,960
You're Dante, right?

1183
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,240
Not a bad name.

1184
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:15,840
Neither is yours.

1185
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,420
Where the hell...

1186
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:23,820
Ma'am?

1187
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:33,540
She's styling.

1188
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:37,640
That regal look suits you.

1189
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,440
Oh my god!

1190
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,440
It's been her the whole time.

1191
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,720
It's been Trish the whole time.

1192
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:52,780
Damn.

1193
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:53,780
Mom?

1194
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:54,780
Wait.

1195
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,360
Why is she so young?

1196
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,940
Then I'll just have to kick his ass.

1197
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,260
My mom is so hot!

1198
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,020
Well, not my mom anymore.

1199
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:07,280
I'm Nero now.

1200
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:11,600
Yeah, um, shut up game.

1201
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:20,520
Wait, did I get any skill points for that?

1202
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:24,040
DDs.

1203
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,540
Wow, she's got a...

1204
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:27,780
That's what Trish has.

1205
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,060
A couple pair of...

1206
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:32,660
Wow.

1207
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,000
S rank orb finder.

1208
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,380
That's my only mission in my afterlife.

1209
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,360
Prevent the birth of god?

1210
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,500
But I already wished him happy birthday.

1211
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:51,970
I'm gonna buy...

1212
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:53,830
Some more stars.

1213
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:54,250
Wait.

1214
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:57,810
Oh yeah, I'm already maxed out on blue orbs.

1215
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:00,530
That's so sad.

1216
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:03,630
We are close to more orb.

1217
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,290
Maybe I'll save it.

1218
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,600
Shadow, Latina was fake.

1219
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:22,120
Trish, of course it was a fake.

1220
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:34,140
The cloth she pulls across herself to change clothes is more fabric than either of her outfits combined.

1221
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,700
Yeah, where did it come from?

1222
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,640
Just one vital star is a treat?

1223
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:45,780
Oh my gosh, sorry guys, the pollen is actually kicking my butt.

1224
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,720
Don't stand in my way.

1225
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:06,150
It's your birthday.

1226
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:08,450
You can do whatever you want.

1227
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:10,870
The music is how midstream feels.

1228
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:15,470
Thanks, acceptable casualty.

1229
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:17,090
I mean, causality.

1230
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:20,570
I'll be right back.

1231
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:29,890
Yeah,

1232
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:34,850
I'm gonna go get some water.

1233
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:37,410
I'll be super, super fast.

1234
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:39,750
How many people get that name wrong?

1235
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:43,650
I only know one person that reads worse than I do.

1236
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:46,230
And her name is Mataracon.

1237
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:47,490
Okay, I'll be right back.

1238
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:33,970
Guys, my cat looked so cute right now.

1239
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:34,970
It was really hard to leave.

1240
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:38,830
I gave her a big ol' smooch on the head.

1241
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:44,030
The roach has christened me causality.

1242
01:22:46,030 --> 01:22:48,750
Wait, it actually says causality.

1243
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:51,850
It was cut off, so I thought it said casualty.

1244
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:55,610
I didn't realize you changed it.

1245
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:07,210
It was cut off in the super chat, so I thought it was...

1246
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:11,750
Maybe I'm the bad reader then.

1247
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:14,210
Wait, it still said...

1248
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:16,450
Oh, it does say casualty.

1249
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:18,110
I can't read.

1250
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:34,280
I can't read.

1251
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:35,860
I can't read!

1252
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,960
Bring back glasses, Vito.

1253
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,760
I love my illiterate OC.

1254
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:54,340
Oh my goodness.

1255
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:56,840
That was funny.

1256
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:59,780
Okay, I will save the star.

1257
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:02,120
We'll save up for a plorb instead.

1258
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,160
Oh wait, was there anything...

1259
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:06,900
Oh wait, not item.

1260
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,060
Scale out.

1261
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:08,820
How much do we have?

1262
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:09,300
3000?

1263
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,500
Okay, mission start!

1264
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:14,760
We're gonna prevent the birth of a god.

1265
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,460
It's okay, we can't read either.

1266
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:18,460
We just mash the keys.

1267
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:24,470
The only woman to gaslight in absentia.

1268
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:27,570
Whoa, advent chamber.

1269
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:30,310
I don't need the glasses.

1270
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:32,970
Don't tell me what to do.

1271
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:35,710
What's this?

1272
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,360
I see.

1273
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,180
Nice.

1274
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:57,540
Whoa, big area.

1275
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:07,890
You nasty little creature, you.

1276
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:11,090
Yeah, you deserve your butt to be beaten up.

1277
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:12,710
Yeah, you deserve that.

1278
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:18,250
You deserve your butt to be...

1279
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,920
Nasty bugs, you.

1280
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:22,960
Disgust me.

1281
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:26,980
Oh wait, it's the hot man.

1282
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,680
So have I.

1283
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,780
This time has immediately...

1284
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:35,280
Wait, the time has immediately rolled over and gone to sleep?

1285
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:35,620
Wait.

1286
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,520
What's that?

1287
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,080
Hot man.

1288
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:44,300
Come here.

1289
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,140
Oh, we got hollowed each other.

1290
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,240
I'm trying to...

1291
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:55,560
Nice.

1292
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:57,580
Where are you?

1293
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:58,780
Where's your clothes?

1294
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,520
Oh, what the?

1295
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,240
What?

1296
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:01,980
What happened?

1297
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:09,530
Slam dunk!

1298
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,640
And three shot!

1299
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:28,160
What just happened to you?

1300
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:36,970
Taking your clothes and stripping you.

1301
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:38,170
Stripping you bare.

1302
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:41,610
Easy.

1303
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:43,970
Delayed explosion.

1304
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:44,010
Delayed explosion.

1305
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:49,770
Charge 3 has a delayed explosion.

1306
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:50,870
I see.

1307
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:55,030
I see, I see.

1308
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:56,410
What is this for?

1309
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:02,970
What, is there going to be a tricky blorb here too?

1310
01:27:03,970 --> 01:27:06,450
I don't think there's anything on that side.

1311
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:08,530
I might be wrong, but...

1312
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:12,250
I can explore real quick.

1313
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:16,490
Just look around.

1314
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:19,170
Oh, there's a skill issue, man.

1315
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,230
Wait, do I have to get a smoking style here?

1316
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:28,950
Do I have to get a smoking style?

1317
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:43,410
Yes?

1318
01:27:47,010 --> 01:27:48,790
I don't think that's possible for me.

1319
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:52,150
We're out of atomic though.

1320
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:03,130
Gotta have!

1321
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:05,530
Get lost!

1322
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:10,070
Oh my gosh, it's so tricky.

1323
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,770
There we go.

1324
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:17,450
Oh...

1325
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:29,470
Oh my goodness.

1326
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,350
It's too difficult.

1327
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:39,850
Can you taunt the statue?

1328
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:42,990
I don't think so.

1329
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:47,390
Other combos I have?

1330
01:28:47,470 --> 01:28:48,490
I sold the ball.

1331
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:54,370
Maybe if I did have the other combos I'd be able to do it.

1332
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:56,510
I sold the ball.

1333
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:07,580
Nice!

1334
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,560
Oh, shoot.

1335
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:21,960
Almost so close.

1336
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,600
I think I need to also hit in the air.

1337
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:33,680
No, dang it.

1338
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:34,920
I'm so used to it.

1339
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:35,780
Oh my goodness.

1340
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,000
I did it again!

1341
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,120
What's wrong with me?

1342
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,080
There we go.

1343
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,320
So close!

1344
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:53,680
Please!

1345
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:05,620
I don't know, guys.

1346
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,020
ZT?

1347
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:12,600
Can I?

1348
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:22,700
Is this a waste of my ZT?

1349
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:24,840
I

1350
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:33,510
don't know, guys.

1351
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:38,030
I just can't get high enough.

1352
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:55,700
I can't get close enough!

1353
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:05,350
Why doesn't he jump anymore?

1354
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:06,230
There we go.

1355
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:18,830
Mash LT.

1356
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:22,310
Charge shot.

1357
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:24,930
Wait, charge shot while...

1358
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:26,610
Charge shot while attacking?

1359
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:27,310
I can do that?

1360
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:30,350
Wait.

1361
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:33,610
I can't.

1362
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:46,190
I'm losing

1363
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:53,390
it!

1364
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,460
No!

1365
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:01,280
No!

1366
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:07,680
No, I'm going to lose it.

1367
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:09,280
Wait.

1368
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:16,650
Wait, I lost it though.

1369
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:18,610
I'm charging.

1370
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:29,420
It like exploded.

1371
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,780
Oh, is it delayed?

1372
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:41,760
I might give up, you guys.

1373
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:50,160
I'm trying to do the rev in between attacks, but...

1374
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,580
I'm not doing it very well.

1375
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:55,560
Rev!

1376
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:55,900
Rev!

1377
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:56,340
Rev!

1378
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:06,400
Rev!

1379
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:06,620
Rev!

1380
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:06,940
Rev!

1381
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,620
I give up.

1382
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,560
I give up.

1383
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:13,520
I give up.

1384
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:14,760
I give up.

1385
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,820
I don't think I have enough combos.

1386
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:21,100
Like every time I get close, it's just not close enough.

1387
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:26,580
It's OK.

1388
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,280
It's OK.

1389
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:36,700
I don't want to waste so much time there anyway.

1390
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,260
We got close.

1391
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,460
We got close.

1392
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:40,880
It's OK.

1393
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:42,920
What's that?

1394
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:50,440
There's somebody.

1395
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:52,980
Oh, hello.

1396
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:54,220
What's this?

1397
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,080
Proceeding alone is strictly prohibited.

1398
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,040
You can't touch me.

1399
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:04,460
Yeah, I can't say I didn't try.

1400
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:05,140
So true.

1401
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:12,220
I like thought the rev was like...

1402
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:17,020
Like you 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 on the LT, you know?

1403
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:20,300
But I guess I don't quite understand it.

1404
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:21,340
That's OK.

1405
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,780
It's an advanced technique.

1406
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:26,800
Yeah.

1407
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:29,800
Wait a second.

1408
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:35,420
I just...

1409
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:44,950
Portal?

1410
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:49,650
Actually, I have two default combos.

1411
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:50,510
It's OK.

1412
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:54,070
I really don't want to waste a lot of time on it, but thank you.

1413
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:59,350
Do I... Oh, do I have to summon... Wait.

1414
01:35:00,690 --> 01:35:01,770
I can't go alone.

1415
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:03,870
Do I have to summon my...

1416
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:04,830
My guy?

1417
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:07,510
Shall we dance?

1418
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:11,370
Come here.

1419
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:12,710
Come here.

1420
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:14,190
Oh, never mind.

1421
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:15,270
I just have to pull him in.

1422
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:18,910
You're my date.

1423
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:21,430
Catch this!

1424
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:27,130
I thought I was going to have to summon my DT.

1425
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:29,290
I didn't realize that it was a...

1426
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:33,650
A, you know, activated by the other lever.

1427
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:37,030
Oh, we got it?

1428
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:42,850
What are you glowing for?

1429
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:45,410
How did you know?

1430
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:46,830
That was my favorite thing.

1431
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:49,010
No!

1432
01:36:03,170 --> 01:36:03,370
No!

1433
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:03,830
No!

1434
01:36:04,850 --> 01:36:05,890
Where am I?

1435
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:06,670
Oh no.

1436
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:07,790
I'm lost.

1437
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,560
Can I get to the other side?

1438
01:36:19,470 --> 01:36:21,370
Is that not where the gorb...

1439
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:23,770
Gorb is?

1440
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:26,290
Whatever.

1441
01:36:27,670 --> 01:36:28,330
Vroom vroom.

1442
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:29,950
That's what I did.

1443
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:34,690
I made it.

1444
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:39,170
That was a porb, no?

1445
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:45,680
Wait, this is huge.

1446
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:46,340
A devil star.

1447
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:54,210
You're punishing me for getting the porb.

1448
01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:55,250
Or the devil star.

1449
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:56,690
Don't be like this.

1450
01:36:58,210 --> 01:36:59,250
Don't be like this.

1451
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:12,910
Oh damn!

1452
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:13,090
Oh damn!

1453
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,620
Why aren't you fighting back?

1454
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:36,700
You scared of me?

1455
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:38,940
You scared of me?

1456
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:46,020
Nice thrusting.

1457
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:51,560
I'm basically a master at this point.

1458
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:53,560
Can I get that orb?

1459
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:55,260
You're not gonna...

1460
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:55,400
OK.

1461
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:05,660
I do need to go over here actually.

1462
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:14,980
Oh shoot.

1463
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:25,860
This isn't the gold guy, is it?

1464
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:26,880
I can't tell actually.

1465
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:27,880
Maybe it is.

1466
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:31,240
Yes it is!

1467
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:55,220
Yeah, try.

1468
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:08,760
Everybody is testing me.

1469
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:33,630
Easy mode.

1470
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:38,560
No!

1471
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:40,500
Maybe I shouldn't have grabbed that gorb.

1472
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:47,990
Stupid!

1473
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:54,110
OK.

1474
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:55,230
I get it.

1475
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:58,390
They are so obsessed with me!

1476
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:06,580
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1477
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:07,200
OK, fine.

1478
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:08,600
You guys leave me no choice.

1479
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:10,440
Oh damn.

1480
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:17,280
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1481
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,800
That's what I tried doing before, but...

1482
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:29,120
Oh shoot.

1483
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:29,680
Oh shoot.

1484
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:32,140
Ouch!

1485
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,800
I should have just dodged it.

1486
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:39,080
Oh my gosh.

1487
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:39,740
Leave me alone!

1488
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:42,740
My orbs!

1489
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:47,800
No!

1490
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:56,200
Oh my goodness.

1491
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:04,230
You are annoying.

1492
01:41:05,130 --> 01:41:06,730
There is such a pain in my side.

1493
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:08,390
OK, finally we got rid of one guy.

1494
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:32,930
One guy has been defeated.

1495
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:35,650
Yeah!

1496
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:37,190
Suplex!

1497
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:54,110
Thank you guys for explaining.

1498
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:56,150
I could only read part of the super chat.

1499
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:58,110
But yeah, revving is kind of...

1500
01:41:58,110 --> 01:42:02,170
I try, if I can, remember or you know, whatever.

1501
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:04,750
But it's not gonna be a main focus.

1502
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:08,430
A lot of people were saying in comments before that...

1503
01:42:09,230 --> 01:42:10,730
It's kind of like...

1504
01:42:10,730 --> 01:42:13,770
For your first ever time playthrough, you don't really have to worry about it.

1505
01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:15,350
It's nice if you do it.

1506
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:17,430
But yeah, I'm not gonna be like...

1507
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:18,570
What to?

1508
01:42:18,710 --> 01:42:19,050
What to?

1509
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:19,810
What to?

1510
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:20,490
What to?

1511
01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:21,430
What to?

1512
01:42:23,210 --> 01:42:24,090
Yeah, so...

1513
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:26,630
Hello?

1514
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:28,730
Hello?

1515
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:30,570
What did this activate?

1516
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:31,770
Did I activate it already?

1517
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:35,150
What did you activate?

1518
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:42,710
Oh, I already activated it?

1519
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:44,150
The elevator.

1520
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:47,050
The one next to the divinity statue?

1521
01:42:47,290 --> 01:42:47,510
OK.

1522
01:42:48,510 --> 01:42:50,870
I saw it showed me something, but I was also looking at you.

1523
01:42:52,710 --> 01:42:54,470
What a foolish thing for me to do.

1524
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:05,330
Oh my god.

1525
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:06,370
You again?

1526
01:43:07,470 --> 01:43:08,830
You guys are so... OK.

1527
01:43:14,050 --> 01:43:14,490
Yeah.

1528
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:25,890
Why two of you?

1529
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:27,490
Why?

1530
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:32,550
Why two?

1531
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:45,000
Please.

1532
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:45,720
Please.

1533
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:46,340
Please.

1534
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:47,740
Please.

1535
01:43:55,860 --> 01:43:58,160
Why are there two of you?

1536
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:03,330
Oh my gosh.

1537
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:12,650
Just book it?

1538
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:13,430
So true.

1539
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:14,550
I'm gonna leave.

1540
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:19,760
It's only curious.

1541
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:20,300
All good.

1542
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:24,680
There's lots of ways to play the game.

1543
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:31,000
So of course everyone's gonna have their preferred style.

1544
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:40,220
It looks like the lady...

1545
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:43,700
from Kill la Kill.

1546
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:44,340
The mob?

1547
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:53,200
Are you God?

1548
01:45:03,810 --> 01:45:04,370
Oh!

1549
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:05,610
My girlfriend!

1550
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:09,290
No!

1551
01:45:11,370 --> 01:45:12,830
Oh my god.

1552
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:14,230
Is she the god?

1553
01:45:17,470 --> 01:45:18,090
Chariot.

1554
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:29,070
I don't think we're at that stage yet.

1555
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:31,430
We need to get past hand holding first.

1556
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:52,640
Get sucked back into the egg.

1557
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:09,280
Oh my god.

1558
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:10,340
He has a blue archive.

1559
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:11,720
OK.

1560
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:15,960
Alright.

1561
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:16,540
Boss fight.

1562
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:21,920
OK.

1563
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:22,700
Let's see.

1564
01:46:27,610 --> 01:46:27,930
What?

1565
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:28,870
How do we...

1566
01:46:30,310 --> 01:46:31,310
Alright mister.

1567
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:33,290
OK.

1568
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:35,330
OK.

1569
01:46:37,990 --> 01:46:39,850
How do I...

1570
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:43,530
Is there only two of them?

1571
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:49,400
We need the lock on for this fight.

1572
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:49,460
OK.

1573
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,600
You snatch.

1574
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:03,110
I want that thing.

1575
01:47:03,530 --> 01:47:03,890
No.

1576
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:04,690
Change!

1577
01:47:05,330 --> 01:47:05,670
Change!

1578
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:11,350
No!

1579
01:47:12,590 --> 01:47:12,990
Please!

1580
01:47:13,210 --> 01:47:13,710
Can I have it?

1581
01:47:14,110 --> 01:47:15,210
It's in your bubble.

1582
01:47:34,010 --> 01:47:34,890
Damn.

1583
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:38,940
That hurts bad.

1584
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:40,380
Oh my god.

1585
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:40,680
Please!

1586
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:44,660
I... Hold on.

1587
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:48,180
I clearly don't know how to change targets.

1588
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:52,940
Because it's not L3.

1589
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:54,280
What is it?

1590
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:55,960
R3.

1591
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:57,040
R3.

1592
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:57,400
OK.

1593
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:06,810
It's not R3.

1594
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:10,470
Oh god.

1595
01:48:10,630 --> 01:48:10,830
OK.

1596
01:48:10,930 --> 01:48:11,190
Hold on.

1597
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:12,150
I'm going to have to just...

1598
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:14,890
I mean, obviously I'm going to have to read in this fight, but...

1599
01:48:23,740 --> 01:48:26,140
Sounds like he kind of sometimes says vocals vintage.

1600
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:27,600
Which is pretty funny.

1601
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:27,700
Wait.

1602
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:31,260
Oh shit.

1603
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:34,540
Move the stick when targeting?

1604
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:39,360
That's kind of what's kicking my ass right now.

1605
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:42,800
Hello?

1606
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,640
Let's not press the stick.

1607
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:51,100
Yeah.

1608
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:52,160
I tried that.

1609
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,580
Let's try it again.

1610
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:57,220
OK.

1611
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:01,760
Ah.

1612
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:04,580
Pressing only changes?

1613
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:20,230
This sucks.

1614
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:30,380
OK.

1615
01:50:08,610 --> 01:50:09,790
Grab is huge in this.

1616
01:50:10,350 --> 01:50:10,830
Oh shit.

1617
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:31,600
Oh shit.

1618
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:38,060
I think I'm on phase 2.

1619
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:40,300
Elder abuse.

1620
01:50:45,650 --> 01:50:47,870
I miss beating up the old man.

1621
01:50:48,150 --> 01:50:48,430
Oh no.

1622
01:50:48,990 --> 01:50:49,350
Oh no.

1623
01:50:49,930 --> 01:50:50,470
Old man.

1624
01:50:51,930 --> 01:50:54,330
I prefer beating you up instead of this.

1625
01:50:54,990 --> 01:50:55,430
Um...

1626
01:50:56,590 --> 01:50:58,030
I much prefer that.

1627
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:01,210
Oh.

1628
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:01,650
Seriously?

1629
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:03,210
Ouch.

1630
01:51:03,290 --> 01:51:03,410
Ouch.

1631
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:03,650
Ouch.

1632
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:05,510
Shit.

1633
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:11,360
Shit.

1634
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:11,600
Shit.

1635
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:12,400
Shit.

1636
01:51:19,890 --> 01:51:20,330
Ouch.

1637
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:20,570
Ouch.

1638
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:20,750
Ouch.

1639
01:51:20,890 --> 01:51:20,890
Ouch.

1640
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:21,990
For

1641
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:30,540
the savior!

1642
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,020
Oh god.

1643
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:36,020
I just had a feeling that would happen, but...

1644
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:52,800
Yeah.

1645
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:53,100
Yeah.

1646
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:53,380
Yeah.

1647
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,880
Why can't I grab sometimes?

1648
01:52:00,510 --> 01:52:01,330
Oh shit.

1649
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:12,510
Nah.

1650
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:25,660
Get to his ass.

1651
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:27,120
Get to his ass.

1652
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:27,680
Get to his ass.

1653
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:28,280
Get to his ass.

1654
01:52:28,460 --> 01:52:29,320
Get to his ass.

1655
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:29,620
No!

1656
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:52,630
Oh god.

1657
01:52:53,230 --> 01:52:54,370
The second phase sucks.

1658
01:52:55,290 --> 01:52:56,750
The second phase sucks.

1659
01:52:57,430 --> 01:52:58,410
The second phase sucks.

1660
01:53:07,810 --> 01:53:09,350
I know I'm just kind of...

1661
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:10,550
There we go.

1662
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:17,920
No!

1663
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,540
More power of the savior, please!

1664
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:29,450
I don't know if that actually does anything, but...

1665
01:53:31,570 --> 01:53:32,010
Please.

1666
01:53:54,670 --> 01:53:55,770
Oh my gosh.

1667
01:53:55,850 --> 01:53:57,270
I did not dodge that one, but that's OK.

1668
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,960
I can't seem to...

1669
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,160
Get him back to...

1670
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:20,160
To a point where I can...

1671
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:21,740
You know?

1672
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:25,640
Every time!

1673
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:28,300
Just use holy water?

1674
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:28,940
For real?

1675
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:34,160
I know this doesn't do anything, but I don't care!

1676
01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:37,160
Oh, charge shoot.

1677
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:40,100
Oh, I don't think I can.

1678
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:40,920
Oh, maybe.

1679
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:44,000
Ouch!

1680
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:44,240
Ouch!

1681
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:44,600
Ouch!

1682
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:44,780
Ouch!

1683
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:44,860
Ouch!

1684
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:45,020
Ouch!

1685
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,480
OK, die.

1686
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:47,620
Oh, please!

1687
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:54,120
Please!

1688
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:54,740
Oh shit!

1689
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:54,940
Shit!

1690
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:55,060
Shit!

1691
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:15,960
This sucks!

1692
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:17,040
This sucks!

1693
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:34,180
I don't know how to change...

1694
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:36,080
Targets.

1695
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:39,800
I don't know how to change targets.

1696
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,260
Yeah, I do have max snatch.

1697
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:52,780
I do.

1698
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:56,040
You don't need.

1699
01:55:57,420 --> 01:56:00,300
But when I'm trying to grab the other thing...

1700
01:56:12,930 --> 01:56:14,750
It's cheap, so I'm just gonna buy it.

1701
01:56:18,290 --> 01:56:21,350
It wasn't with L3 either when I tried it before.

1702
01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:25,990
At least the first part isn't so bad.

1703
01:56:28,210 --> 01:56:29,870
Second phase sucks though.

1704
01:56:56,660 --> 01:56:57,280
Come here!

1705
01:56:58,020 --> 01:56:59,120
No, no, no, no!

1706
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:00,440
I messed up!

1707
01:57:10,170 --> 01:57:10,810
Oh shoot!

1708
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:13,610
Please, can you?

1709
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:14,890
There we go.

1710
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:19,730
Please, grab him!

1711
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:20,350
There we go.

1712
01:57:28,070 --> 01:57:29,850
You are the demon, not me!

1713
01:57:30,550 --> 01:57:31,910
You tell him Nero!

1714
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:32,810
You tell him!

1715
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,760
There we go.

1716
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:05,920
Yeah!

1717
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:09,020
Alright, phase 2.

1718
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:24,820
I'm

1719
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:29,980
nervous.

1720
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:34,240
Oh shoot.

1721
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:35,600
Oh.

1722
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:37,780
No!

1723
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,040
No more power!

1724
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:39,580
No power!

1725
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:40,020
No power!

1726
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:40,780
No power, please!

1727
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:01,700
Oh shoot!

1728
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:05,180
I almost dodged that, but not quite.

1729
01:59:06,020 --> 01:59:06,980
Oh my goodness, no!

1730
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:07,600
Please!

1731
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,600
Oh, this fight is hard.

1732
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:20,560
Oh shoot!

1733
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:20,840
No!

1734
01:59:21,580 --> 01:59:22,740
I was so close!

1735
01:59:28,100 --> 01:59:29,260
Shoot the fireballs!

1736
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:29,640
I know!

1737
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:30,380
I was trying!

1738
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:32,000
I was trying!

1739
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:39,240
Oh shoot!

1740
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:40,560
Nice!

1741
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:51,610
Oh my god!

1742
01:59:51,650 --> 01:59:53,930
He keeps doing the stupid power of the savior!

1743
01:59:59,030 --> 02:00:00,770
Oh my gosh!

1744
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:07,730
Wait, buster the punch?

1745
02:00:08,730 --> 02:00:09,890
Oh shoot.

1746
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:11,190
I didn't realize what he was.

1747
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:19,200
Please!

1748
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:22,560
Please!

1749
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:23,360
Please!

1750
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:24,260
Please!

1751
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:24,940
Please!

1752
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:25,760
Please!

1753
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:25,960
Please!

1754
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,560
I just DT'd.

1755
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:31,760
Wait, this is buster, right?

1756
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:41,300
I don't think I did it right.

1757
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:43,720
I forgot to lock on.

1758
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:47,480
Ouch!

1759
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:50,400
Do it early?

1760
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:50,820
OK.

1761
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:54,240
Oh this fight.

1762
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:55,940
I shoot!

1763
02:00:56,100 --> 02:00:56,620
I shoot!

1764
02:00:56,860 --> 02:00:57,380
But I...

1765
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:01,910
There we go.

1766
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:14,940
So do it early?

1767
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:16,100
Like now?

1768
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:17,200
Like now?

1769
02:01:24,230 --> 02:01:27,210
When he says do it now, do I do it now?

1770
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:32,850
Do I do it when he says do it now?

1771
02:01:37,210 --> 02:01:39,550
Is he the one backseating me?

1772
02:01:40,530 --> 02:01:42,930
Is he backseating me and I...

1773
02:01:46,650 --> 02:01:50,990
I wonder if I can chip him down a little bit more before he gets to second phase.

1774
02:01:50,990 --> 02:01:59,490
If I can chip him down a little bit more before I psycho mode DT, I wonder if I can get him way lower.

1775
02:02:02,110 --> 02:02:04,130
You can't skip the second phase.

1776
02:02:14,310 --> 02:02:16,830
Buster needs to be out before the punch.

1777
02:02:17,490 --> 02:02:18,770
Pitch perfect timing.

1778
02:02:18,770 --> 02:02:18,870
Nice.

1779
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:25,540
I'll

1780
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:39,300
try to knock the fist back.

1781
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:40,840
I'll do my best you guys.

1782
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:42,580
I'll do my best.

1783
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:44,640
I'll do my best.

1784
02:03:06,910 --> 02:03:07,170
Come here.

1785
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:07,410
Come here.

1786
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:07,710
Come here.

1787
02:03:07,770 --> 02:03:08,570
Stop running away.

1788
02:03:11,610 --> 02:03:14,830
Alright, I'm gonna do this and then...

1789
02:03:14,830 --> 02:03:17,430
I'm gonna DT unless he...

1790
02:03:18,610 --> 02:03:20,750
Unless he goes to the guy.

1791
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:21,230
We'll see.

1792
02:03:26,490 --> 02:03:26,950
Okay.

1793
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:27,430
Okay.

1794
02:03:27,570 --> 02:03:29,230
Now I just gotta do it one more time.

1795
02:03:32,410 --> 02:03:34,370
Can I get to you, mister?

1796
02:03:35,490 --> 02:03:36,270
Here we go.

1797
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:42,430
Now this should get his health way further down.

1798
02:03:49,970 --> 02:03:51,790
Oh, not as far as I thought.

1799
02:03:54,070 --> 02:03:55,030
Shoot while punching?

1800
02:03:55,250 --> 02:03:56,030
You can spam...

1801
02:03:56,030 --> 02:03:58,110
Gosh, I always... Thank you for the reminder.

1802
02:03:58,710 --> 02:03:59,710
I forgot about that.

1803
02:04:01,290 --> 02:04:02,230
About the same.

1804
02:04:02,330 --> 02:04:03,250
Yeah, about the same.

1805
02:04:06,170 --> 02:04:07,050
Okay, here we go.

1806
02:04:08,790 --> 02:04:10,050
Oh, I did it.

1807
02:04:18,970 --> 02:04:19,410
Oopsie.

1808
02:04:31,390 --> 02:04:31,850
Okay.

1809
02:04:32,070 --> 02:04:32,250
Alright.

1810
02:04:32,990 --> 02:04:33,250
Alright.

1811
02:04:33,410 --> 02:04:33,630
Alright.

1812
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:33,930
Alright.

1813
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:46,420
I did it!

1814
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:47,500
I did it first try!

1815
02:04:58,860 --> 02:05:00,040
Oh my gosh!

1816
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:01,100
That was so clean!

1817
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:04,000
That was so...

1818
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:11,700
Oh my gosh!

1819
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:12,440
We did it!

1820
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:14,040
Thank you guys for the hand.

1821
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:24,700
It did feel good.

1822
02:05:24,820 --> 02:05:25,880
It felt so good.

1823
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,520
Where did Nero come from?

1824
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:46,540
Who is this guy?

1825
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:48,200
No!

1826
02:05:48,940 --> 02:05:50,680
No, not the sword!

1827
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:55,420
And I don't actually answer that.

1828
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:06,820
Yeah, smiley face.

1829
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:07,520
No...

1830
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:10,180
Oh.

1831
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:12,900
The brother.

1832
02:06:13,120 --> 02:06:14,120
Credit card.

1833
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:15,020
Oh no!

1834
02:06:15,740 --> 02:06:16,320
Kevin!

1835
02:06:17,180 --> 02:06:17,780
Credo!

1836
02:06:19,090 --> 02:06:21,900
Shoot, I can't remember this guy's name.

1837
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:39,600
Kitty.

1838
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:47,060
Yeah, true.

1839
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:54,420
So...

1840
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:59,820
Oh no!

1841
02:07:02,140 --> 02:07:03,540
Crap!

1842
02:07:11,110 --> 02:07:12,510
Dante!

1843
02:07:18,390 --> 02:07:20,730
Holy Trish and her Trishes.

1844
02:07:29,150 --> 02:07:32,150
Credit card was implied.

1845
02:07:40,650 --> 02:07:41,770
Oh yeah!

1846
02:07:41,870 --> 02:07:42,610
Snatch!

1847
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:44,930
Oh yeah!

1848
02:07:45,230 --> 02:07:45,870
Snatch!

1849
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:48,550
Ouchie, ouchie, ouchie.

1850
02:07:57,510 --> 02:08:00,890
Not the yaoi man.

1851
02:08:11,010 --> 02:08:12,930
So melodramatic.

1852
02:08:19,170 --> 02:08:21,430
What's happening to him?

1853
02:08:22,230 --> 02:08:23,450
He's turning into dust.

1854
02:08:27,730 --> 02:08:32,280
I think I love Nero.

1855
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:38,220
He's got so much sass.

1856
02:08:43,730 --> 02:08:46,050
The middle fingers he got absorbed.

1857
02:08:46,430 --> 02:08:47,190
It's too good.

1858
02:08:54,110 --> 02:08:55,330
Says Dante.

1859
02:08:55,690 --> 02:08:57,530
Pot calling the kettle black, huh?

1860
02:09:07,330 --> 02:09:09,750
She's not gonna transform into something ugly.

1861
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:12,490
She's gonna transform into one of those creepy things.

1862
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:24,800
Time to...

1863
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,600
Become one, huh?

1864
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:27,240
No!

1865
02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:28,140
Kitty!

1866
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:37,760
No!

1867
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:51,040
Oh baby, he's crying!

1868
02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:01,660
Oh,

1869
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:07,480
the meat.

1870
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:14,920
That's what's inside there?

1871
02:10:20,670 --> 02:10:21,710
That's nasty.

1872
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:34,340
Dogs

1873
02:10:47,770 --> 02:10:49,770
He's so stupid.

1874
02:11:02,850 --> 02:11:04,530
Nah, I don't think so.

1875
02:11:09,650 --> 02:11:10,330
Yamato

1876
02:11:21,170 --> 02:11:22,510
Yeah, he knows.

1877
02:11:23,890 --> 02:11:24,490
He knows.

1878
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:31,570
Stinking crap-o mansplaining to us.

1879
02:11:36,310 --> 02:11:38,870
He's really bleeding out.

1880
02:11:45,430 --> 02:11:46,570
Character change?

1881
02:11:51,270 --> 02:11:52,730
Don't get up!

1882
02:11:54,250 --> 02:11:54,890
Please.

1883
02:11:55,710 --> 02:11:57,290
Honor one last request.

1884
02:11:58,290 --> 02:11:58,970
Save them.

1885
02:12:00,370 --> 02:12:03,650
Kitty A and Nero.

1886
02:12:04,870 --> 02:12:06,910
Why does he gotta honor your request?

1887
02:12:07,110 --> 02:12:07,710
I don't know either.

1888
02:12:33,170 --> 02:12:34,510
He's such a sob.

1889
02:12:42,850 --> 02:12:45,910
It's cool, but stick to the plan.

1890
02:12:50,830 --> 02:12:52,270
Hot mama.

1891
02:12:53,450 --> 02:12:54,870
God dang.

1892
02:12:57,990 --> 02:12:59,990
So we...the character switch?

1893
02:13:01,610 --> 02:13:04,110
I only got 62% of orbs.

1894
02:13:04,170 --> 02:13:05,130
I'm losing my touch.

1895
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:08,630
I'm losing my touch everybody.

1896
02:13:17,540 --> 02:13:18,840
Oh, Hojo.

1897
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:25,140
Real?

1898
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:25,760
Physically?

1899
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:28,220
I got ears and fang.

1900
02:13:28,660 --> 02:13:29,560
Fang one.

1901
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,660
I don't remember his name actually.

1902
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:55,960
Anus?

1903
02:13:56,080 --> 02:13:56,980
That's not his name.

1904
02:13:57,140 --> 02:13:58,000
Oh, Angus Beef.

1905
02:13:58,040 --> 02:13:58,560
That's right.

1906
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:03,820
Guys, I think it's starting to get serious.

1907
02:14:06,100 --> 02:14:11,860
Guys, I think it's starting to get real serious.

1908
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:26,020
Trish, I need...Oh my god, no.

1909
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:27,540
No, please god, no.

1910
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:31,720
I can only grabby grab so much.

1911
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,660
Trish, I need you to do your job.

1912
02:14:38,140 --> 02:14:39,460
Oh my gosh.

1913
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:40,740
No!

1914
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:42,520
These guys are the worst.

1915
02:14:45,380 --> 02:14:47,460
Nobody wants to deal with these guys.

1916
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:53,640
I'll miss you if you don't have your Assassin's Creed cosplay on.

1917
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:02,640
Trish?

1918
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:07,480
They put all the NPC people in hoods so they wouldn't have to animate their hair.

1919
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:08,760
That's so smart.

1920
02:15:11,540 --> 02:15:13,940
Oh yes, we have the warrior guys.

1921
02:15:16,620 --> 02:15:17,900
They are being controlled.

1922
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:19,920
So they are like...

1923
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:35,960
Yeah, it's all staged.

1924
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:52,880
Wow,

1925
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:02,450
he's putting on a good show.

1926
02:16:02,810 --> 02:16:03,410
I'm not gonna lie.

1927
02:16:15,410 --> 02:16:15,890
Change!

1928
02:16:19,460 --> 02:16:25,380
Changing from Nero to Dante carries over your vitality, DT gauge, proud souls and all orbs and items obtained.

1929
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:30,560
All proud souls will be refunded and can be reused to acquire techniques specifically for Dante.

1930
02:16:32,940 --> 02:16:36,100
They made the demon problem so they could sell the divine solution.

1931
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:37,200
Yeah, pretty much.

1932
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:41,260
I'm not that into Zodiacs, but are my Zodiacs cursed or blessed?

1933
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:45,260
My Lunar Animal Zodiac year is the Snake and my Constellation Zodiac month is Cancer.

1934
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:50,040
I don't know anything about Zodiacs.

1935
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:56,360
If you're a snake, it's probably a good thing.

1936
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:00,640
Will you start accidentally calling Dante Nero?

1937
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:01,160
Right!

1938
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:01,840
Oh no!

1939
02:17:16,610 --> 02:17:17,250
What?

1940
02:17:17,730 --> 02:17:19,890
This is the worst...

1941
02:17:22,470 --> 02:17:26,930
This is the worst outfit I've damn ever seen.

1942
02:17:27,630 --> 02:17:33,230
It doesn't suit him at all.

1943
02:17:33,290 --> 02:17:34,030
It's so bad.

1944
02:17:36,090 --> 02:17:36,730
Spardante?

1945
02:17:37,270 --> 02:17:39,190
It looks like he should be in Castlevania.

1946
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:41,610
Oh, it's so bad.

1947
02:17:42,070 --> 02:17:45,230
Why the... I think it wouldn't be less bad with the monocle.

1948
02:17:45,230 --> 02:17:46,990
It's so bad.

1949
02:17:52,590 --> 02:17:53,710
I feel like I have to.

1950
02:17:54,590 --> 02:17:59,310
Try not to spoil... How long do I get to play as Dante?

1951
02:18:01,390 --> 02:18:05,710
As a killer Zodiac guy, I can tell you that everything is going to be just fine.

1952
02:18:06,690 --> 02:18:07,650
Miles Edgeworth?

1953
02:18:07,830 --> 02:18:08,770
No, no, no.

1954
02:18:08,850 --> 02:18:09,930
This is not Miles Edgeworth.

1955
02:18:10,050 --> 02:18:12,110
This is... What's his name?

1956
02:18:12,650 --> 02:18:13,730
Von Karma.

1957
02:18:16,630 --> 02:18:17,470
A while.

1958
02:18:17,830 --> 02:18:18,570
For a while?

1959
02:18:18,730 --> 02:18:19,570
OK, then I'm going to play.

1960
02:18:24,690 --> 02:18:27,690
Come to grips with the power... I didn't press anything.

1961
02:18:28,250 --> 02:18:30,790
Come to grips with the power of the legendary Devil Hunter.

1962
02:18:33,150 --> 02:18:34,890
Oh, I did not mean to press that.

1963
02:18:35,070 --> 02:18:36,350
That's my fault.

1964
02:18:38,990 --> 02:18:43,030
Let's do this one and then I think I'm... It's like, are you sure?

1965
02:18:43,910 --> 02:18:48,110
It's giving me... It's like, are you sure you want this outfit?

1966
02:18:49,190 --> 02:18:51,910
It's giving me a second chance.

1967
02:18:54,310 --> 02:18:56,910
OK, for the first mission I'll use normal Dante.

1968
02:18:57,930 --> 02:18:58,550
Oh, my bad.

1969
02:18:58,730 --> 02:18:59,190
There we go.

1970
02:18:59,370 --> 02:19:01,830
For the first mission I'll use normal Dante.

1971
02:19:04,830 --> 02:19:05,350
OK.

1972
02:19:07,050 --> 02:19:07,830
Player change.

1973
02:19:09,250 --> 02:19:10,890
This is so bad.

1974
02:19:11,510 --> 02:19:13,350
We will use that costume at some point.

1975
02:19:17,570 --> 02:19:18,370
Rebellion!

1976
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:24,180
Press and hold Y.

1977
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:27,060
Oh my gosh!

1978
02:19:31,580 --> 02:19:32,380
Sure.

1979
02:19:33,220 --> 02:19:34,240
That's all I have?

1980
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:37,780
Coyote A.

1981
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:42,980
Stinger my beloved!

1982
02:19:44,020 --> 02:19:45,700
Oh he also has a charge shot.

1983
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:49,820
What do we have for DT though?

1984
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:51,780
Trigger heart.

1985
02:19:52,660 --> 02:19:53,700
Oh, that's good.

1986
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:56,460
We don't have very much though.

1987
02:19:56,780 --> 02:19:57,140
Speed!

1988
02:19:58,440 --> 02:19:59,380
Enemy step?

1989
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:00,740
Oh, air hike!

1990
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:08,350
No!

1991
02:20:08,350 --> 02:20:08,510
No!

1992
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:12,630
Oh no!

1993
02:20:18,130 --> 02:20:20,570
Wait, I'm going to refund this one.

1994
02:20:29,410 --> 02:20:32,430
Maybe we can get all of them to at least...

1995
02:20:36,920 --> 02:20:39,280
I don't even use Royal Guard.

1996
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:40,460
I didn't use it before.

1997
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:45,720
Not to sound spoilery, but the Sparta costume is hilarious for a certain cutscene.

1998
02:20:47,340 --> 02:20:52,260
Hopefully it's not this route.

1999
02:20:52,420 --> 02:20:53,360
This mission.

2000
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:58,880
Gun, sword, gun, trick, gun, bomb, gun, gun...

2001
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:03,120
I use the trickster a lot because...Oh my god.

2002
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:08,960
Holy...Oh my god.

2003
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:23,480
Winning game, please spam the D-pad for peek view.

2004
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:26,200
What does he call it out?

2005
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:33,560
Does he be like sword, sword, gun, trickster, sword, gun master, sword, trickster, gun, sword master...

2006
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:34,580
He dies?

2007
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:44,640
Oh geez.

2008
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:48,160
Wow, look at him go.

2009
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:51,340
What is four?

2010
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:54,800
Oh that's what he did to me.

2011
02:21:54,940 --> 02:21:55,940
That's what he did to me.

2012
02:21:58,080 --> 02:21:58,580
No.

2013
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:05,420
Nah, we'll hold on to guns later.

2014
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:08,040
Maybe we'll do trickster.

2015
02:22:08,820 --> 02:22:09,780
Trickster four.

2016
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:13,320
Oh gosh.

2017
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:19,600
This.

2018
02:22:27,710 --> 02:22:29,210
You, you, you.

2019
02:22:30,250 --> 02:22:32,750
They just gave me a little taste of what was to come.

2020
02:22:33,670 --> 02:22:34,670
Oh my god.

2021
02:22:34,790 --> 02:22:36,230
Oh my god.

2022
02:22:40,230 --> 02:22:42,210
I already bought double heart.

2023
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:43,550
I already bought it.

2024
02:22:44,330 --> 02:22:45,830
Or, oh no, I bought trigger heart.

2025
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:46,570
What's devil heart?

2026
02:22:46,690 --> 02:22:47,270
Wait, what's that one?

2027
02:22:54,100 --> 02:22:58,640
Remember, this is the first DMC where you can swap styles with the D-pad and not at the start of levels.

2028
02:22:58,980 --> 02:23:00,340
True, you're so right.

2029
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:02,100
Oh, trigger, it is trigger heart.

2030
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:03,280
I bought it.

2031
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,100
I bought it already.

2032
02:23:06,220 --> 02:23:07,840
You're too, you're too slow.

2033
02:23:14,900 --> 02:23:15,540
Shall we...

2034
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:16,760
Start...

2035
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:27,160
By pressing D-pad, Dante can change his fighting style on the fly.

2036
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:29,540
Changing style will change the effect of...

2037
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:31,640
During battle.

2038
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,640
Proud souls are more for Dante than Dero.

2039
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:35,680
True, right.

2040
02:23:42,530 --> 02:23:43,550
Oh my god.

2041
02:23:44,090 --> 02:23:44,610
Can't

2042
02:23:49,150 --> 02:23:49,930
be grabbed anymore.

2043
02:23:52,730 --> 02:23:54,330
Oh my gosh, it's crazy.

2044
02:23:54,330 --> 02:23:54,370
Crazy.

2045
02:23:56,990 --> 02:23:58,410
Oh my god.

2046
02:23:59,850 --> 02:24:01,210
Turn it down a little bit.

2047
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:05,180
Oh, Stinger.

2048
02:24:07,340 --> 02:24:08,660
Stinger, I miss you.

2049
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:10,420
Oh, you're so good.

2050
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:11,380
You work so well.

2051
02:24:23,750 --> 02:24:24,770
DT Stinger.

2052
02:24:25,630 --> 02:24:26,390
You're right.

2053
02:24:31,910 --> 02:24:32,010
Oh!

2054
02:24:32,930 --> 02:24:38,370
Is he

2055
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:43,320
good?

2056
02:24:44,060 --> 02:24:44,880
There he is.

2057
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:49,860
Oh, wow.

2058
02:25:16,020 --> 02:25:18,040
It's so silly.

2059
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:20,220
I'm such a fan.

2060
02:25:22,930 --> 02:25:24,580
Come on.

2061
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:26,220
Come on.

2062
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:27,680
Come on.

2063
02:25:31,340 --> 02:25:32,720
Oh my goodness.

2064
02:25:33,740 --> 02:25:34,940
Oh, we are so bad.

2065
02:25:37,820 --> 02:25:40,200
Kinda gonna miss grabby grab though.

2066
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:42,680
Did I go the right way?

2067
02:25:43,700 --> 02:25:45,960
Wait, was there anywhere else in this room?

2068
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:00,320
Oh my god!

2069
02:26:01,740 --> 02:26:04,320
It feels so nostalgic for some reason.

2070
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:10,140
We've only been a little bit with Nero, but even still I'm just like, wow.

2071
02:26:30,990 --> 02:26:32,510
It just feels right.

2072
02:26:32,930 --> 02:26:36,770
It's gonna be really difficult for me though to...

2073
02:26:37,550 --> 02:26:39,290
To remember stuff.

2074
02:26:39,370 --> 02:26:39,870
Maybe not.

2075
02:26:39,970 --> 02:26:41,750
Maybe it'll come like second nature, you know?

2076
02:26:44,570 --> 02:26:47,930
But it's really hard not to just spam Stinger, I'll be honest.

2077
02:26:50,230 --> 02:26:50,670
Trickster.

2078
02:26:52,050 --> 02:26:53,810
You can hold that spinny move, I can.

2079
02:26:54,270 --> 02:26:55,950
Oh, what lies ahead has already been raised.

2080
02:26:56,270 --> 02:26:56,730
There's no... Oh.

2081
02:26:57,290 --> 02:26:58,770
Okay, I was going the right way.

2082
02:27:06,150 --> 02:27:08,270
I'm a DMC casual and I'm proud.

2083
02:27:08,430 --> 02:27:09,770
I will spam Stinger.

2084
02:27:10,410 --> 02:27:11,370
I'm proud.

2085
02:27:12,690 --> 02:27:13,910
I love it.

2086
02:27:14,890 --> 02:27:18,610
Playing Dante in this game for the first time felt like coming home after a long trip.

2087
02:27:18,710 --> 02:27:18,950
Right!

2088
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:21,410
Wait, is this different now?

2089
02:27:24,390 --> 02:27:25,670
Oh no, I'm still Nero.

2090
02:27:26,030 --> 02:27:26,450
Nevermind.

2091
02:27:28,090 --> 02:27:29,390
Please be gentle with Dante.

2092
02:27:29,550 --> 02:27:32,670
If you spam his voice lines too much you'll have a headache and be sad.

2093
02:27:33,390 --> 02:27:34,410
I don't think so.

2094
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:40,280
Oh, what is that?

2095
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:41,780
Oh, I don't like that.

2096
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:43,280
Oh, I don't like that at all.

2097
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:50,940
Some pants.

2098
02:27:52,320 --> 02:27:54,320
Is it a certain little lady?

2099
02:27:56,180 --> 02:27:56,600
Perhaps.

2100
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:00,280
Oh no, it's his pants.

2101
02:28:00,920 --> 02:28:02,340
Damn, when are we going to see ladies?

2102
02:28:21,330 --> 02:28:23,610
I already missed Grabby Grab, I'm not going to lie.

2103
02:28:33,580 --> 02:28:34,360
Holy cow.

2104
02:28:34,780 --> 02:28:35,760
Oh, it's too good.

2105
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:37,600
Oh, I'm on Trickster, that's right.

2106
02:28:48,180 --> 02:28:48,580
Holy...

2107
02:28:48,580 --> 02:28:50,080
Oh, I thought I killed him.

2108
02:28:53,980 --> 02:28:55,280
It's been so long.

2109
02:28:55,580 --> 02:28:57,060
I just can't... I want to spam it.

2110
02:28:59,260 --> 02:28:59,860
Tag!

2111
02:28:59,880 --> 02:29:01,160
Get washed!

2112
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:05,820
Good old Stinger spam.

2113
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:10,640
Never... never fails.

2114
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:13,020
He is so fast, right?

2115
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:17,240
He's so fast.

2116
02:29:21,430 --> 02:29:23,370
DT Stinger eats up the DT gauge.

2117
02:29:23,490 --> 02:29:23,950
Got it.

2118
02:29:24,230 --> 02:29:27,230
I didn't notice that it didn't last very long.

2119
02:29:29,350 --> 02:29:29,930
Understood.

2120
02:29:30,230 --> 02:29:31,110
Are there still lasers?

2121
02:29:31,610 --> 02:29:33,130
Oh, this isn't the laser room.

2122
02:29:34,910 --> 02:29:37,630
Oh, I got the wing talisman.

2123
02:29:43,230 --> 02:29:45,510
One of the idols is taking a nap.

2124
02:29:47,950 --> 02:29:49,210
Sleep for me, Dante.

2125
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:56,240
His odors and his stamina issues.

2126
02:29:56,540 --> 02:29:57,420
It's okay.

2127
02:30:02,890 --> 02:30:03,350
lol

2128
02:30:07,350 --> 02:30:09,210
He's doing that meme.

2129
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:11,390
The Pulp Fiction meme.

2130
02:30:12,150 --> 02:30:12,530
Come on.

2131
02:30:13,430 --> 02:30:14,290
Sleep for me, Dante.

2132
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:18,640
Sleep for me.

2133
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:20,360
Sleep, pussy.

2134
02:30:22,180 --> 02:30:22,840
You're tired.

2135
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:24,840
You're getting sleepy.

2136
02:30:25,860 --> 02:30:27,500
This is what I do to my cat, okay?

2137
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:30,260
When my cat is trying to sleep, I go...

2138
02:30:30,260 --> 02:30:31,080
Are you tired?

2139
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:33,180
Do you want to go to Dream Town?

2140
02:30:33,900 --> 02:30:35,840
Is the sound of my voice making you sleepy?

2141
02:30:36,780 --> 02:30:39,280
Do you want to chase some mice in your dreams?

2142
02:30:39,640 --> 02:30:41,320
Do you want to go to Dream Town?

2143
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:43,300
Do you want to go to sleep?

2144
02:30:44,140 --> 02:30:45,580
Are your eyelids getting heavy?

2145
02:30:46,580 --> 02:30:49,980
Do you want to go chase mice in your dreams?

2146
02:30:52,780 --> 02:30:54,460
This isn't my tag!

2147
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:55,640
I'm gonna stop.

2148
02:30:58,280 --> 02:31:00,680
God's power no longer resides here.

2149
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:03,000
Headquarters has begun to collapse.

2150
02:31:09,830 --> 02:31:11,730
That doesn't seem very good.

2151
02:31:12,270 --> 02:31:14,150
You have less than 10 minutes to escape.

2152
02:31:14,870 --> 02:31:16,470
But what about all the rorbs?

2153
02:31:16,550 --> 02:31:17,130
Okay, I'll leave.

2154
02:31:18,050 --> 02:31:18,950
I won't be greedy.

2155
02:31:23,100 --> 02:31:24,360
I'll be a little greedy.

2156
02:31:28,540 --> 02:31:29,060
Wait.

2157
02:31:29,060 --> 02:31:30,220
I think I messed up.

2158
02:31:40,070 --> 02:31:41,030
Where is the opening?

2159
02:31:42,690 --> 02:31:44,010
Where is Dante?

2160
02:31:46,050 --> 02:31:47,110
Oh, dang it!

2161
02:31:47,350 --> 02:31:47,970
You guys!

2162
02:31:52,550 --> 02:31:54,610
I didn't see that one coming.

2163
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:20,760
That was a lower barrier.

2164
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:21,420
What does that mean?

2165
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:24,480
Oh my god, please die!

2166
02:32:26,420 --> 02:32:26,940
Die!

2167
02:32:36,200 --> 02:32:38,260
Okay, time to go.

2168
02:32:38,900 --> 02:32:39,620
Please?

2169
02:32:41,220 --> 02:32:43,480
You guys are too fat.

2170
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:46,000
Alright.

2171
02:32:47,180 --> 02:32:47,960
Oh, but...

2172
02:32:48,980 --> 02:32:51,040
I think I have enough time.

2173
02:32:53,820 --> 02:32:54,180
I didn't

2174
02:32:57,560 --> 02:33:01,640
get it before, so it's only fair I get it now.

2175
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:06,540
You'll be fine.

2176
02:33:06,820 --> 02:33:07,340
Really?

2177
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:10,120
No!

2178
02:33:12,220 --> 02:33:13,260
Oh no.

2179
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:16,060
Wait, can I not grabby grab the guys?

2180
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:18,260
Oh gosh.

2181
02:33:19,300 --> 02:33:20,100
Change gun.

2182
02:33:20,280 --> 02:33:20,600
LT.

2183
02:33:22,900 --> 02:33:25,280
Press LT to change your long range gun.

2184
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:26,580
Okay.

2185
02:33:30,660 --> 02:33:32,480
I love DMC2!

2186
02:33:34,180 --> 02:33:34,860
I

2187
02:33:45,820 --> 02:33:46,780
love DMC2!

2188
02:34:01,330 --> 02:34:02,430
We made it!

2189
02:34:02,450 --> 02:34:02,970
We made it!

2190
02:34:05,130 --> 02:34:05,490
Yeah!

2191
02:34:05,930 --> 02:34:06,230
Yeah!

2192
02:34:08,810 --> 02:34:09,350
This thing?

2193
02:34:11,710 --> 02:34:12,570
Make it stop!

2194
02:34:12,730 --> 02:34:13,690
Oh, we made it faster.

2195
02:34:13,850 --> 02:34:14,330
Oh no!

2196
02:34:16,030 --> 02:34:16,570
Oh yeah!

2197
02:34:16,710 --> 02:34:17,070
Overheat!

2198
02:34:17,150 --> 02:34:17,510
Overload!

2199
02:34:17,630 --> 02:34:17,990
Overload!

2200
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:18,390
There we go.

2201
02:34:18,410 --> 02:34:18,770
There we go.

2202
02:34:20,470 --> 02:34:20,830
Perfect!

2203
02:34:24,970 --> 02:34:26,310
Key of Kronos!

2204
02:34:32,650 --> 02:34:34,970
I have to make sure I leave out the correct one.

2205
02:34:41,590 --> 02:34:42,110
Shirley's.

2206
02:34:42,170 --> 02:34:42,290
Okay.

2207
02:34:42,730 --> 02:34:43,490
Yeah, it's this one.

2208
02:34:47,390 --> 02:34:47,910
Nice.

2209
02:34:49,410 --> 02:34:50,150
Oh, you.

2210
02:34:51,050 --> 02:34:51,790
It worked!

2211
02:34:54,770 --> 02:34:55,030
Ouch.

2212
02:34:55,110 --> 02:34:55,510
Ouchy ouch.

2213
02:35:00,730 --> 02:35:02,090
Ouchy ouchy ouchy ouch.

2214
02:35:02,570 --> 02:35:03,510
Oh come on.

2215
02:35:03,530 --> 02:35:04,090
That's so unfair.

2216
02:35:04,090 --> 02:35:04,230
Unfair.

2217
02:35:16,660 --> 02:35:17,840
Trickster might help.

2218
02:35:18,860 --> 02:35:20,220
Oh, I was on Trickster.

2219
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:21,880
Oh, thank you.

2220
02:35:28,300 --> 02:35:29,280
You're right.

2221
02:35:29,880 --> 02:35:30,680
Trickster big help.

2222
02:35:31,780 --> 02:35:32,580
Trickster big help!

2223
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:34,440
Let's go.

2224
02:35:35,660 --> 02:35:37,080
And grab some...

2225
02:35:37,670 --> 02:35:40,440
Roll orbs while we're at it.

2226
02:35:46,970 --> 02:35:52,550
Maybe we don't need it.

2227
02:35:53,250 --> 02:35:54,290
There is nothing in here.

2228
02:35:55,190 --> 02:35:59,450
I saw...I saw...I saw a purple devil.

2229
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:27,660
Oh nice!

2230
02:36:28,940 --> 02:36:29,620
Nice!

2231
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:33,700
Oh come on!

2232
02:36:33,780 --> 02:36:34,120
No!

2233
02:36:48,010 --> 02:36:49,030
I did it.

2234
02:36:49,210 --> 02:36:49,750
Somehow.

2235
02:36:50,910 --> 02:36:52,250
Dante is so strong.

2236
02:36:53,470 --> 02:36:55,190
Oh, it wasn't purple.

2237
02:36:55,330 --> 02:36:56,530
It was a stinking thing.

2238
02:36:58,270 --> 02:37:00,490
I don't think there is anything else here, right?

2239
02:37:01,050 --> 02:37:01,950
There are some chairs.

2240
02:37:04,390 --> 02:37:09,370
How far do I need to get away from the exploding place?

2241
02:37:12,210 --> 02:37:12,910
Uh oh.

2242
02:37:13,170 --> 02:37:13,330
Ok.

2243
02:37:13,530 --> 02:37:13,710
Ok.

2244
02:37:13,950 --> 02:37:14,170
Ok.

2245
02:37:14,350 --> 02:37:14,530
Ok.

2246
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:21,600
Nice!

2247
02:37:22,180 --> 02:37:22,460
Yeah!

2248
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:24,580
Yeah!

2249
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:29,780
See ya!

2250
02:37:34,180 --> 02:37:35,520
Not that far apparently.

2251
02:37:35,820 --> 02:37:37,280
We just went outside.

2252
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:43,440
We had so much time.

2253
02:37:47,460 --> 02:37:48,560
Dante look!

2254
02:37:49,080 --> 02:37:50,260
Oh look at you!

2255
02:37:50,480 --> 02:37:51,320
Look at you!

2256
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:55,080
You're so handsome.

2257
02:38:03,080 --> 02:38:04,180
Pose with him.

2258
02:38:11,690 --> 02:38:15,030
All his little mannerisms are all the same.

2259
02:38:16,350 --> 02:38:17,950
It's so nice.

2260
02:38:18,090 --> 02:38:20,810
He even goes to break down and everything is all the same.

2261
02:38:20,870 --> 02:38:21,630
It's so comfortable.

2262
02:38:22,830 --> 02:38:23,950
Yeah!

2263
02:38:24,810 --> 02:38:25,390
Yeah!

2264
02:38:26,670 --> 02:38:28,030
We're running.

2265
02:38:28,350 --> 02:38:28,710
We're running.

2266
02:38:29,030 --> 02:38:29,430
We're running.

2267
02:38:29,770 --> 02:38:30,170
We're running.

2268
02:38:31,270 --> 02:38:31,930
We're running.

2269
02:38:32,730 --> 02:38:34,110
I'm still running.

2270
02:38:35,510 --> 02:38:36,230
Nice scenery.

2271
02:38:38,950 --> 02:38:40,070
Pizza!

2272
02:38:41,050 --> 02:38:41,970
Lady!

2273
02:38:45,590 --> 02:38:47,930
Pizza on Friday!

2274
02:38:54,110 --> 02:38:54,890
Exactly.

2275
02:39:04,130 --> 02:39:06,710
Everyone is still hanging out.

2276
02:39:19,580 --> 02:39:21,850
They worship a demon as a god?

2277
02:39:26,050 --> 02:39:27,450
Yeah.

2278
02:39:30,150 --> 02:39:32,190
They're a wolf.

2279
02:39:33,450 --> 02:39:37,530
Not my pizza.

2280
02:39:44,690 --> 02:39:45,390
So?

2281
02:39:45,970 --> 02:39:46,490
So?

2282
02:39:49,870 --> 02:39:51,570
She looks good in that suit.

2283
02:39:52,210 --> 02:39:52,690
Is that a suit?

2284
02:39:52,990 --> 02:39:53,570
What do you call it?

2285
02:39:54,250 --> 02:39:56,670
In that blazer coat and nothing else.

2286
02:39:56,970 --> 02:39:57,290
Trish?

2287
02:40:04,340 --> 02:40:05,240
Oh my god.

2288
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:06,020
I want some pizza.

2289
02:40:06,540 --> 02:40:07,600
See you there!

2290
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:07,740
See you there!

2291
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:16,400
He was just reminiscing.

2292
02:40:23,860 --> 02:40:24,540
Ladies!

2293
02:40:24,900 --> 02:40:25,440
Ladies!

2294
02:40:27,540 --> 02:40:28,900
Not bad.

2295
02:40:29,760 --> 02:40:30,800
A for A!

2296
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:31,940
One second though.

2297
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,140
I'll show my YouTube pros.

2298
02:40:42,060 --> 02:40:42,580
Nice.

2299
02:40:44,660 --> 02:40:45,700
One second.

2300
02:40:46,040 --> 02:40:48,620
Why is YouTube always so weird?

2301
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:50,400
Nice.

2302
02:40:50,480 --> 02:40:50,700
Nice.

2303
02:40:50,840 --> 02:40:51,040
Nice.

2304
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:57,060
Well guys, I think I might actually call it here.

2305
02:40:57,300 --> 02:40:59,080
It's a little... It's not so many...

2306
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:03,660
Not so many missions, but I'm feeling so...

2307
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:06,440
I need to get some sleep for real tonight.

2308
02:41:06,680 --> 02:41:08,660
And I actually didn't have dinner, so...

2309
02:41:10,280 --> 02:41:12,380
I'm sorry that it's a bit shorter of a stream.

2310
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:16,760
My next mission might be longer, so this is a good point.

2311
02:41:16,920 --> 02:41:17,220
Cool.

2312
02:41:17,340 --> 02:41:17,480
Cool.

2313
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:17,680
Cool.

2314
02:41:17,780 --> 02:41:17,840
Cool.

2315
02:41:18,380 --> 02:41:20,480
Three missions, three bosses is solid.

2316
02:41:22,360 --> 02:41:22,840
Yeah.

2317
02:41:23,740 --> 02:41:26,160
I like that there was more cutscenes in this one too.

2318
02:41:26,280 --> 02:41:29,080
Because I like just watching how they're all so silly.

2319
02:41:30,040 --> 02:41:34,020
The anime lady often comes up with excuses to keep Dante deep in debt to her.

2320
02:41:35,960 --> 02:41:37,360
She's so tsundere maybe.

2321
02:41:38,660 --> 02:41:42,460
Why is DMC2 depressed of Dante suddenly going to...

2322
02:41:42,460 --> 02:41:45,640
Off the church and running to the new protag and silly pulling him out of his bunk.

2323
02:41:49,960 --> 02:41:52,660
Yeah, more DMC4 next week, so...

2324
02:41:53,560 --> 02:41:54,800
But it will not be on Friday.

2325
02:41:55,560 --> 02:41:58,140
So, it will be a different day.

2326
02:41:59,060 --> 02:42:02,120
Obviously, you'll see it when I have the schedule out.

2327
02:42:02,520 --> 02:42:04,600
Thank you guys for more DMC today.

2328
02:42:04,980 --> 02:42:06,640
And I will...

2329
02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:07,220
Oh, there we go.

2330
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,280
I'm just going to go to the mission menu.

2331
02:42:13,660 --> 02:42:17,200
I am so tired.

2332
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:22,560
But I've got to get some sleep and tomorrow is Peace Walker.

2333
02:42:22,800 --> 02:42:24,040
I've got to be energized for that.

2334
02:42:24,100 --> 02:42:26,100
And I have another collab tomorrow night.

2335
02:42:26,600 --> 02:42:29,780
Still deciding if I'm going to have my POV for that.

2336
02:42:31,240 --> 02:42:32,080
We'll see.

2337
02:42:32,860 --> 02:42:34,820
I might embarrass myself with my Nihongo.

2338
02:42:34,980 --> 02:42:36,120
I hate speaking Nihongo.

2339
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:38,620
I can understand, but I hate speaking.

2340
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:41,600
So, I'm self-conscious.

2341
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:44,860
I have no confidence.

2342
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:47,000
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

2343
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:47,740
Thank you, thank you.

2344
02:42:53,800 --> 02:42:54,360
Sumimasari.

2345
02:42:56,540 --> 02:42:59,640
It's because I always get so psyched out.

2346
02:42:59,720 --> 02:43:02,840
I can't remember how to speak or words or anything.

2347
02:43:02,840 --> 02:43:06,880
I don't have many opportunities to speak.

2348
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:08,780
I don't know, maybe this is good practice.

2349
02:43:09,380 --> 02:43:10,580
I mean, well, it is good practice.

2350
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:11,180
I don't know.

2351
02:43:11,420 --> 02:43:13,100
Anyway, I'm going to...

2352
02:43:13,100 --> 02:43:16,460
My brain is done-zo for now.

2353
02:43:16,860 --> 02:43:17,820
That's just me normally.

2354
02:43:18,340 --> 02:43:19,520
Yeah, who's in the collab?

2355
02:43:21,320 --> 02:43:24,620
It's Coyote from Kemono Friends.

2356
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:25,020
Milky.

2357
02:43:25,460 --> 02:43:27,940
I'm excited I get to collab with her before she graduates.

2358
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:30,280
I have confidence.

2359
02:43:35,820 --> 02:43:36,700
Nekomiya Hinata.

2360
02:43:37,060 --> 02:43:40,840
It's also a bunch of people I don't know too, so I'm like...

2361
02:43:42,500 --> 02:43:43,380
Nervous, nervous.

2362
02:43:43,480 --> 02:43:44,760
Ayami Mama, of course.

2363
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:46,300
Ayami Mama is in there too.

2364
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:47,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2365
02:43:54,100 --> 02:43:56,180
So, I'm excited to meet new people.

2366
02:43:57,940 --> 02:43:58,720
Otsumito, everybody.

2367
02:43:58,860 --> 02:43:59,620
Thank you so much.

2368
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:00,600
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2369
02:44:00,600 --> 02:44:02,400
And I will see you.

2370
02:44:02,440 --> 02:44:03,220
Oh, no Henya.

2371
02:44:03,320 --> 02:44:05,200
I don't think Henya this time.

2372
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:06,640
Thanks for the stream.

2373
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:08,280
Such a busy week.

2374
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:09,740
Be sure to get some good sleep.

2375
02:44:09,860 --> 02:44:10,180
Thank you!

2376
02:44:12,800 --> 02:44:14,180
Minto Nihongo teaching stream?

2377
02:44:14,360 --> 02:44:14,600
No.

2378
02:44:14,860 --> 02:44:16,120
I'm no sensei.

2379
02:44:17,360 --> 02:44:19,000
I need to go back to school.

2380
02:44:21,180 --> 02:44:21,980
Ok, Otsumito.

2381
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:22,820
Thank you everyone.

2382
02:44:23,060 --> 02:44:23,520
Have a good day.

2383
02:44:23,700 --> 02:44:24,100
Have a good night.

2384
02:44:24,600 --> 02:44:25,440
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2385
02:44:25,720 --> 02:44:26,740
Bye bye.

2386
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:28,420
Have a good day.

2387
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:31,120
Bye bye.
